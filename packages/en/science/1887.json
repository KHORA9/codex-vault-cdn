  "content": "THE LIFE OF THE SPIDER\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I: THE BLACK-BELLIED TARANTULA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spider has a bad name: to most of us, she represents an odious,\r\nnoxious animal, which every one hastens to crush under foot.  Against\r\nthis summary verdict the observer sets the beast's industry, its talent\r\nas a weaver, its wiliness in the chase, its tragic nuptials and other\r\ncharacteristics of great interest.  Yes, the Spider is well worth\r\nstudying, apart from any scientific reasons; but she is said to be\r\npoisonous and that is her crime and the primary cause of the repugnance\r\nwherewith she inspires us.  Poisonous, I agree, if by that we understand\r\nthat the animal is armed with two fangs which cause the immediate death\r\nof the little victims which it catches; but there is a wide difference\r\nbetween killing a Midge and harming a man.  However immediate in its\r\neffects upon the insect entangled in the fatal web, the Spider's poison\r\nis not serious for us and causes less inconvenience than a Gnat-bite.\r\nThat, at least, is what we can safely say as regards the great majority\r\nof the Spiders of our regions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a few are to be feared; and foremost among these is the\r\nMalmignatte, the terror of the Corsican peasantry.  I have seen her\r\nsettle in the furrows, lay out her web and rush boldly at insects larger\r\nthan herself; I have admired her garb of black velvet speckled with\r\ncarmine-red; above all, I have heard most disquieting stories told about\r\nher.  Around Ajaccio and Bonifacio, her bite is reputed very dangerous,\r\nsometimes mortal.  The countryman declares this for a fact and the doctor\r\ndoes not always dare deny it.  In the neighbourhood of Pujaud, not far\r\nfrom Avignon, the harvesters speak with dread of _Theridion lugubre_, {1}\r\nfirst observed by Leon Dufour in the Catalonian mountains; according to\r\nthem, her bite would lead to serious accidents.  The Italians have\r\nbestowed a bad reputation on the Tarantula, who produces convulsions and\r\nfrenzied dances in the person stung by her.  To cope with 'tarantism,'\r\nthe name given to the disease that follows on the bite of the Italian\r\nSpider, you must have recourse to music, the only efficacious remedy, so\r\nthey tell us.  Special tunes have been noted, those quickest to afford\r\nrelief.  There is medical choreography, medical music.  And have we not\r\nthe tarantella, a lively and nimble dance, bequeathed to us perhaps by\r\nthe healing art of the Calabrian peasant?\r\n\r\nMust we take these queer things seriously or laugh at them?  From the\r\nlittle that I have seen, I hesitate to pronounce an opinion.  Nothing\r\ntells us that the bite of the Tarantula may not provoke, in weak and very\r\nimpressionable people, a nervous disorder which music will relieve;\r\nnothing tells us that a profuse perspiration, resulting from a very\r\nenergetic dance, is not likely to diminish the discomfort by diminishing\r\nthe cause of the ailment.  So far from laughing, I reflect and enquire,\r\nwhen the Calabrian peasant talks to me of his Tarantula, the Pujaud\r\nreaper of his _Theridion lugubre_, the Corsican husbandman of his\r\nMalmignatte.  Those Spiders might easily deserve, at least partly, their\r\nterrible reputation.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful Spider in my district, the Black-bellied Tarantula,\r\nwill presently give us something to think about, in this connection.  It\r\nis not my business to discuss a medical point, I interest myself\r\nespecially in matters of instinct; but, as the poison-fangs play a\r\nleading part in the huntress' manoeuvres of war, I shall speak of their\r\neffects by the way.  The habits of the Tarantula, her ambushes, her\r\nartifices, her methods of killing her prey: these constitute my subject.\r\nI will preface it with an account by Leon Dufour, {2} one of those\r\naccounts in which I used to delight and which did much to bring me into\r\ncloser touch with the insect.  The Wizard of the Landes tells us of the\r\nordinary Tarantula, that of the Calabrias, observed by him in Spain:\r\n\r\n   '_Lycosa tarantula_ by preference inhabits open places, dry, arid,\r\n   uncultivated places, exposed to the sun.  She lives generally--at\r\n   least when full-grown--in underground passages, regular burrows, which\r\n   she digs for herself.  These burrows are cylindrical; they are often\r\n   an inch in diameter and run into the ground to a depth of more than a\r\n   foot; but they are not perpendicular.  The inhabitant of this gut\r\n   proves that she is at the same time a skilful hunter and an able\r\n   engineer.  It was a question for her not only of constructing a deep\r\n   retreat that could hide her from the pursuit of her foes: she also had\r\n   to set up her observatory whence to watch for her prey and dart out\r\n   upon it.  The Tarantula provides for every contingency: the\r\n   underground passage, in fact, begins by being vertical, but, at four\r\n   or five inches from the surface, it bends at an obtuse angle, forms a\r\n   horizontal turning and then becomes perpendicular once more.  It is at\r\n   the elbow of this tunnel that the Tarantula posts herself as a\r\n   vigilant sentry and does not for a moment lose sight of the door of\r\n   her dwelling; it was there that, at the period when I was hunting her,\r\n   I used to see those eyes gleaming like diamonds, bright as a cat's\r\n   eyes in the dark.\r\n\r\n   'The outer orifice of the Tarantula's burrow is usually surmounted by\r\n   a shaft constructed throughout by herself.  It is a genuine work of\r\n   architecture, standing as much as an inch above the ground and\r\n   sometimes two inches in diameter, so that it is wider than the burrow\r\n   itself.  This last circumstance, which seems to have been calculated\r\n   by the industrious Spider, lends itself admirably to the necessary\r\n   extension of the legs at the moment when the prey is to be seized.  The\r\n   shaft is composed mainly of bits of dry wood joined by a little clay\r\n   and so artistically laid, one above the other, that they form the\r\n   scaffolding of a straight column, the inside of which is a hollow\r\n   cylinder.  The solidity of this tubular building, of this outwork, is\r\n   ensured above all by the fact that it is lined, upholstered within,\r\n   with a texture woven by the Lycosa's {3} spinnerets and continued\r\n   throughout the interior of the burrow.  It is easy to imagine how\r\n   useful this cleverly-manufactured lining must be for preventing\r\n   landslip or warping, for maintaining cleanliness and for helping her\r\n   claws to scale the fortress.\r\n\r\n   'I hinted that this outwork of the burrow was not there invariably; as\r\n   a matter of fact, I have often come across Tarantulas' holes without a\r\n   trace of it, perhaps because it had been accidentally destroyed by the\r\n   weather, or because the Lycosa may not always light upon the proper\r\n   building-materials, or, lastly, because architectural talent is\r\n   possibly declared only in individuals that have reached the final\r\n   stage, the period of perfection of their physical and intellectual\r\n   development.\r\n\r\n   'One thing is certain, that I have had numerous opportunities of\r\n   seeing these shafts, these out-works of the Tarantula's abode; they\r\n   remind me, on a larger scale, of the tubes of certain Caddis-worms.\r\n   The Arachnid had more than one object in view in constructing them:\r\n   she shelters her retreat from the floods; she protects it from the\r\n   fall of foreign bodies which, swept by the wind, might end by\r\n   obstructing it; lastly, she uses it as a snare by offering the Flies\r\n   and other insects whereon she feeds a projecting point to settle on.\r\n   Who shall tell us all the wiles employed by this clever and daring\r\n   huntress?\r\n\r\n   'Let us now say something about my rather diverting Tarantula-hunts.\r\n   The best season for them is the months of May and June.  The first\r\n   time that I lighted on this Spider's burrows and discovered that they\r\n   were inhabited by seeing her come to a point on the first floor of her\r\n   dwelling--the elbow which I have mentioned--I thought that I must\r\n   attack her by main force and pursue her relentlessly in order to\r\n   capture her; I spent whole hours in opening up the trench with a knife\r\n   a foot long by two inches wide, without meeting the Tarantula.  I\r\n   renewed the operation in other burrows, always with the same want of\r\n   success; I really wanted a pickaxe to achieve my object, but I was too\r\n   far from any kind of house.  I was obliged to change my plan of attack\r\n   and I resorted to craft.  Necessity, they say, is the mother of\r\n   invention.\r\n\r\n   'It occurred to me to take a stalk, topped with its spikelet, by way\r\n   of a bait, and to rub and move it gently at the orifice of the burrow.\r\n   I soon saw that the Lycosa's attention and desires were roused.\r\n   Attracted by the bait, she came with measured steps towards the\r\n   spikelet.  I withdrew it in good time a little outside the hole, so as\r\n   not to leave the animal time for reflexion; and the Spider suddenly,\r\n   with a rush, darted out of her dwelling, of which I hastened to close\r\n   the entrance.  The Tarantula, bewildered by her unaccustomed liberty,\r\n   was very awkward in evading my attempts at capture; and I compelled\r\n   her to enter a paper bag, which I closed without delay.\r\n\r\n   'Sometimes, suspecting the trap, or perhaps less pressed by hunger,\r\n   she would remain coy and motionless, at a slight distance from the\r\n   threshold, which she did not think it opportune to cross.  Her\r\n   patience outlasted mine.  In that case, I employed the following\r\n   tactics: after making sure of the Lycosa's position and the direction\r\n   of the tunnel, I drove a knife into it on the slant, so as to take the\r\n   animal in the rear and cut off its retreat by stopping up the burrow.\r\n   I seldom failed in my attempt, especially in soil that was not stony.\r\n   In these critical circumstances, either the Tarantula took fright and\r\n   deserted her lair for the open, or else she stubbornly remained with\r\n   her back to the blade.  I would then give a sudden jerk to the knife,\r\n   which flung both the earth and the Lycosa to a distance, enabling me\r\n   to capture her.  By employing this hunting-method, I sometimes caught\r\n   as many as fifteen Tarantulae within the space of an hour.\r\n\r\n   'In a few cases, in which the Tarantula was under no misapprehension\r\n   as to the trap which I was setting for her, I was not a little\r\n   surprised, when I pushed the stalk far enough down to twist it round\r\n   her hiding-place, to see her play with the spikelet more or less\r\n   contemptuously and push it away with her legs, without troubling to\r\n   retreat to the back of her lair.\r\n\r\n   'The Apulian peasants, according to Baglivi's {4} account, also hunt\r\n   the Tarantula by imitating the humming of an insect with an oat-stalk\r\n   at the entrance to her burrow.  I quote the passage:\r\n\r\n   '\"_Ruricolae nostri quando eas captare volunt, ad illorum latibula\r\n   accedunt, tenuisque avenacae fistulae sonum, apum murmuri non\r\n   absimilem, modulantur.  Quo audito, ferox exit Tarentula ut muscas vel\r\n   alia hujus modi insecta, quorum murmur esse putat, captat; captatur\r\n   tamen ista a rustico insidiatore_.\" {5}\r\n\r\n   'The Tarantula, so dreadful at first sight, especially when we are\r\n   filled with the idea that her bite is dangerous, so fierce in\r\n   appearance, is nevertheless quite easy to tame, as I have often found\r\n   by experiment.\r\n\r\n   'On the 7th of May 1812, while at Valencia, in Spain, I caught a fair-\r\n   sized male Tarantula, without hurting him, and imprisoned him in a\r\n   glass jar, with a paper cover in which I cut a trap-door.  At the\r\n   bottom of the jar I put a paper bag, to serve as his habitual\r\n   residence.  I placed the jar on a table in my bedroom, so as to have\r\n   him under frequent observation.  He soon grew accustomed to captivity\r\n   and ended by becoming so familiar that he would come and take from my\r\n   fingers the live Fly which I gave him.  After killing his victim with\r\n   the fangs of his mandibles, he was not satisfied, like most Spiders,\r\n   to suck her head: he chewed her whole body, shoving it piecemeal into\r\n   his mouth with his palpi, after which he threw up the masticated\r\n   teguments and swept them away from his lodging.\r\n\r\n   'Having finished his meal, he nearly always made his toilet, which\r\n   consisted in brushing his palpi and mandibles, both inside and out,\r\n   with his front tarsi.  After that, he resumed his air of motionless\r\n   gravity.  The evening and the night were his time for taking his walks\r\n   abroad.  I often heard him scratching the paper of the bag.  These\r\n   habits confirm the opinion, which I have already expressed elsewhere,\r\n   that most Spiders have the faculty of seeing by day and night, like\r\n   cats.\r\n\r\n   'On the 28th of June, my Tarantula cast his skin.  It was his last\r\n   moult and did not perceptibly alter either the colour of his attire or\r\n   the dimensions of his body.  On the 14th of July, I had to leave\r\n   Valencia; and I stayed away until the 23rd.  During this time, the\r\n   Tarantula fasted; I found him looking quite well on my return.  On the\r\n   20th of August, I again left for a nine days' absence, which my\r\n   prisoner bore without food and without detriment to his health.  On\r\n   the 1st of October, I once more deserted the Tarantula, leaving him\r\n   without provisions.  On the 21st, I was fifty miles from Valencia and,\r\n   as I intended to remain there, I sent a servant to fetch him.  I was\r\n   sorry to learn that he was not found in the jar, and I never heard\r\n   what became of him.\r\n\r\n   'I will end my observations on the Tarantulae with a short description\r\n   of a curious fight between those animals.  One day, when I had had a\r\n   successful hunt after these Lycosae, I picked out two full-grown and\r\n   very powerful males and brought them together in a wide jar, in order\r\n   to enjoy the sight of a combat to the death.  After walking round the\r\n   arena several times, to try and avoid each other, they were not slow\r\n   in placing themselves in a warlike attitude, as though at a given\r\n   signal.  I saw them, to my surprise, take their distances and sit up\r\n   solemnly on their hind-legs, so as mutually to present the shield of\r\n   their chests to each other.  After watching them face to face like\r\n   that for two minutes, during which they had doubtless provoked each\r\n   other by glances that escaped my own, I saw them fling themselves upon\r\n   each other at the same time, twisting their legs round each other and\r\n   obstinately struggling to bite each other with the fangs of the\r\n   mandibles.  Whether from fatigue or from convention, the combat was\r\n   suspended; there was a few seconds' truce; and each athlete moved away\r\n   and resumed his threatening posture.  This circumstance reminded me\r\n   that, in the strange fights between cats, there are also suspensions\r\n   of hostilities.  But the contest was soon renewed between my two\r\n   Tarantulae with increased fierceness.  One of them, after holding\r\n   victory in the balance for a while, was at last thrown and received a\r\n   mortal wound in the head.  He became the prey of the conqueror, who\r\n   tore open his skull and devoured it.  After this curious duel, I kept\r\n   the victorious Tarantula alive for several weeks.'\r\n\r\nMy district does not boast the ordinary Tarantula, the Spider whose\r\nhabits have been described above by the Wizard of the Landes; but it\r\npossesses an equivalent in the shape of the Black-bellied Tarantula, or\r\nNarbonne Lycosa, half the size of the other, clad in black velvet on the\r\nlower surface, especially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the\r\nabdomen and grey and white rings around the legs.  Her favourite home is\r\nthe dry, pebbly ground, covered with sun-scorched thyme.  In my _harmas_\r\n{6} laboratory there are quite twenty of this Spider's burrows.  Rarely\r\ndo I pass by one of these haunts without giving a glance down the pit\r\nwhere gleam, like diamonds, the four great eyes, the four telescopes, of\r\nthe hermit.  The four others, which are much smaller, are not visible at\r\nthat depth.\r\n\r\nWould I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from my\r\nhouse, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a dreary\r\nsolitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from stone to\r\nstone.  The love of lucre has laid waste the land.  Because wine paid\r\nhandsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine.  Then came the\r\nPhylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land is now\r\nno more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy grasses sprout\r\namong the pebbles.  This waste-land is the Lycosa's paradise: in an\r\nhour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred burrows within a\r\nlimited range.\r\n\r\nThese dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first and\r\nthen bent elbow-wise.  The average diameter is an inch.  On the edge of\r\nthe hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts and\r\neven small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut.  The whole is kept in place\r\nand cemented with silk.  Often, the Spider confines herself to drawing\r\ntogether the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties down with\r\nthe straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades from the\r\nstems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of a masonry\r\nconstructed of small stones.  The nature of the kerb is decided by the\r\nnature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in the close\r\nneighbourhood of the building-yard.  There is no selection: everything\r\nmeets with approval, provided that it be near at hand.\r\n\r\nEconomy of time, therefore, causes the defensive wall to vary greatly as\r\nregards its constituent elements.  The height varies also.  One enclosure\r\nis a turret an inch high; another amounts to a mere rim.  All have their\r\nparts bound firmly together with silk; and all have the same width as the\r\nsubterranean channel, of which they are the extension.  There is here no\r\ndifference in diameter between the underground manor and its outwork, nor\r\ndo we behold, at the opening, the platform which the turret leaves to\r\ngive free play to the Italian Tarantula's legs.  The Black-bellied\r\nTarantula's work takes the form of a well surmounted by its kerb.\r\n\r\nWhen the soil is earthy and homogeneous, the architectural type is free\r\nfrom obstructions and the Spider's dwelling is a cylindrical tube; but,\r\nwhen the site is pebbly, the shape is modified according to the\r\nexigencies of the digging.  In the second case, the lair is often a\r\nrough, winding cave, at intervals along whose inner wall stick blocks of\r\nstone avoided in the process of excavation.  Whether regular or\r\nirregular, the house is plastered to a certain depth with a coat of silk,\r\nwhich prevents earth-slips and facilitates scaling when a prompt exit is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nBaglivi, in his unsophisticated Latin, teaches us how to catch the\r\nTarantula.  I became his _rusticus insidiator_;  I waved a spikelet at\r\nthe entrance of the burrow to imitate the humming of a Bee and attract\r\nthe attention of the Lycosa, who rushes out, thinking that she is\r\ncapturing a prey.  This method did not succeed with me.  The Spider, it\r\nis true, leaves her remote apartments and comes a little way up the\r\nvertical tube to enquire into the sounds at her door; but the wily animal\r\nsoon scents a trap; it remains motionless at mid-height and, at the least\r\nalarm, goes down again to the branch gallery, where it is invisible.\r\n\r\nLeon Dufour's appears to me a better method if it were only practicable\r\nin the conditions wherein I find myself.  To drive a knife quickly into\r\nthe ground, across the burrow, so as to cut off the Tarantula's retreat\r\nwhen she is attracted by the spikelet and standing on the upper floor,\r\nwould be a manoeuvre certain of success, if the soil were favourable.\r\nUnfortunately, this is not so in my case: you might as well try to dig a\r\nknife into a block of tufa.\r\n\r\nOther stratagems become necessary.  Here are two which were successful: I\r\nrecommend them to future Tarantula-hunters.  I insert into the burrow, as\r\nfar down as I can, a stalk with a fleshy spikelet, which the Spider can\r\nbite into.  I move and turn and twist my bait.  The Tarantula, when\r\ntouched by the intruding body, contemplates self-defence and bites the\r\nspikelet.  A slight resistance informs my fingers that the animal has\r\nfallen into the trap and seized the tip of the stalk in its fangs.  I\r\ndraw it to me, slowly, carefully; the Spider hauls from below, planting\r\nher legs against the wall.  It comes, it rises.  I hide as best I may,\r\nwhen the Spider enters the perpendicular tunnel: if she saw me, she would\r\nlet go the bait and slip down again.  I thus bring her, by degrees, to\r\nthe orifice.  This is the difficult moment.  If I continue the gentle\r\nmovement, the Spider, feeling herself dragged out of her home, would at\r\nonce run back indoors.  It is impossible to get the suspicious animal out\r\nby this means.  Therefore, when it appears at the level of the ground, I\r\ngive a sudden pull.  Surprised by this foul play, the Tarantula has no\r\ntime to release her hold; gripping the spikelet, she is thrown some\r\ninches away from the burrow.  Her capture now becomes an easy matter.\r\nOutside her own house, the Lycosa is timid, as though scared, and hardly\r\ncapable of running away.  To push her with a straw into a paper bag is\r\nthe affair of a second.\r\n\r\nIt requires some patience to bring the Tarantula who has bitten into the\r\ninsidious spikelet to the entrance of the burrow.  The following method\r\nis quicker: I procure a supply of live Bumble-bees.  I put one into a\r\nlittle bottle with a mouth just wide enough to cover the opening of the\r\nburrow; and I turn the apparatus thus baited over the said opening.  The\r\npowerful Bee at first flutters and hums about her glass prison; then,\r\nperceiving a burrow similar to that of her family, she enters it without\r\nmuch hesitation.  She is extremely ill-advised: while she goes down, the\r\nSpider comes up; and the meeting takes place in the perpendicular\r\npassage.  For a few moments, the ear perceives a sort of death-song: it\r\nis the humming of the Bumble-bee, protesting against the reception given\r\nher.  This is followed by a long silence.  Then I remove the bottle and\r\ndip a long-jawed forceps into the pit.  I withdraw the Bumble-bee,\r\nmotionless, dead, with hanging proboscis.  A terrible tragedy must have\r\nhappened.  The Spider follows, refusing to let go so rich a booty.  Game\r\nand huntress are brought to the orifice.  Sometimes, mistrustful, the\r\nLycosa goes in again; but we have only to leave the Bumble-bee on the\r\nthreshold of the door, or even a few inches away, to see her reappear,\r\nissue from her fortress and daringly recapture her prey.  This is the\r\nmoment: the house is closed with the finger, or a pebble and, as Baglivi\r\nsays, '_captatur tamen ista a rustico insidiatore_,' to which I will add,\r\n'_adjuvante Bombo_.' {7}\r\n\r\nThe object of these hunting methods was not exactly to obtain Tarantulae;\r\nI had not the least wish to rear the Spider in a bottle.  I was\r\ninterested in a different matter.  Here, thought I, is an ardent\r\nhuntress, living solely by her trade.  She does not prepare preserved\r\nfoodstuffs for her offspring; {8} she herself feeds on the prey which she\r\ncatches.  She is not a 'paralyzer,' {9} who cleverly spares her quarry so\r\nas to leave it a glimmer of life and keep it fresh for weeks at a time;\r\nshe is a killer, who makes a meal off her capture on the spot.  With her,\r\nthere is no methodical vivisection, which destroys movement without\r\nentirely destroying life, but absolute death, as sudden as possible,\r\nwhich protects the assailant from the counter-attacks of the assailed.\r\n\r\nHer game, moreover, is essentially bulky and not always of the most\r\npeaceful character.  This Diana, ambushed in her tower, needs a prey\r\nworthy of her prowess.  The big Grasshopper, with the powerful jaws; the\r\nirascible Wasp; the Bee, the Bumble-bee and other wearers of poisoned\r\ndaggers must fall into the ambuscade from time to time.  The duel is\r\nnearly equal in point of weapons.  To the venomous fangs of the Lycosa\r\nthe Wasp opposes her venomous stiletto.  Which of the two bandits shall\r\nhave the best of it?  The struggle is a hand-to-hand one.  The Tarantula\r\nhas no secondary means of defence, no cord to bind her victim, no trap to\r\nsubdue her.  When the Epeira, or Garden Spider, sees an insect entangled\r\nin her great upright web, she hastens up and covers the captive with\r\ncorded meshes and silk ribbons by the armful, making all resistance\r\nimpossible.  When the prey is solidly bound, a prick is carefully\r\nadministered with the poison-fangs; then the Spider retires, waiting for\r\nthe death-throes to calm down, after which the huntress comes back to the\r\ngame.  In these conditions, there is no serious danger.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Lycosa, the job is riskier.  She has naught to serve\r\nher but her courage and her fangs and is obliged to leap upon the\r\nformidable prey, to master it by her dexterity, to annihilate it, in a\r\nmeasure, by her swift-slaying talent.\r\n\r\nAnnihilate is the word: the Bumble-bees whom I draw from the fatal hole\r\nare a sufficient proof.  As soon as that shrill buzzing, which I called\r\nthe death-song, ceases, in vain I hasten to insert my forceps: I always\r\nbring out the insect dead, with slack proboscis and limp legs.  Scarce a\r\nfew quivers of those legs tell me that it is a quite recent corpse.  The\r\nBumble-bee's death is instantaneous.  Each time that I take a fresh\r\nvictim from the terrible slaughter-house, my surprise is renewed at the\r\nsight of its sudden immobility.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, both animals have very nearly the same strength; for I\r\nchoose my Bumble-bees from among the largest (_Bombus hortorum_ and _B.\r\nterrestris_).  Their weapons are almost equal: the Bee's dart can bear\r\ncomparison with the Spider's fangs; the sting of the first seems to me as\r\nformidable as the bite of the second.  How comes it that the Tarantula\r\nalways has the upper hand and this moreover in a very short conflict,\r\nwhence she emerges unscathed?  There must certainly be some cunning\r\nstrategy on her part.  Subtle though her poison may be, I cannot believe\r\nthat its mere injection, at any point whatever of the victim, is enough\r\nto produce so prompt a catastrophe.  The ill-famed rattlesnake does not\r\nkill so quickly, takes hours to achieve that for which the Tarantula does\r\nnot require a second.  We must, therefore, look for an explanation of\r\nthis sudden death to the vital importance of the point attacked by the\r\nSpider, rather than to the virulence of the poison.\r\n\r\nWhat is this point?  It is impossible to recognize it on the Bumble-bees.\r\nThey enter the burrow; and the murder is committed far from sight.  Nor\r\ndoes the lens discover any wound upon the corpse, so delicate are the\r\nweapons that produce it.  One would have to see the two adversaries\r\nengage in a direct contest.  I have often tried to place a Tarantula and\r\na Bumble-bee face to face in the same bottle.  The two animals mutually\r\nflee each other, each being as much upset as the other at its captivity.\r\nI have kept them together for twenty-four hours, without aggressive\r\ndisplay on either side.  Thinking more of their prison than of attacking\r\neach other, they temporize, as though indifferent.  The experiment has\r\nalways been fruitless.  I have succeeded with Bees and Wasps, but the\r\nmurder has been committed at night and has taught me nothing.  I would\r\nfind both insects, next morning, reduced to a jelly under the Spider's\r\nmandibles.  A weak prey is a mouthful which the Spider reserves for the\r\ncalm of the night.  A prey capable of resistance is not attacked in\r\ncaptivity.  The prisoner's anxiety cools the hunter's ardour.\r\n\r\nThe arena of a large bottle enables each athlete to keep out of the\r\nother's way, respected by her adversary, who is respected in her turn.\r\nLet us reduce the lists, diminish the enclosure.  I put Bumble-bee and\r\nTarantula into a test-tube that has only room for one at the bottom.  A\r\nlively brawl ensues, without serious results.  If the Bumble-bee be\r\nunderneath, she lies down on her back and with her legs wards off the\r\nother as much as she can.  I do not see her draw her sting.  The Spider,\r\nmeanwhile, embracing the whole circumference of the enclosure with her\r\nlong legs, hoists herself a little upon the slippery surface and removes\r\nherself as far as possible from her adversary.  There, motionless, she\r\nawaits events, which are soon disturbed by the fussy Bumble-bee.  Should\r\nthe latter occupy the upper position, the Tarantula protects herself by\r\ndrawing up her legs, which keep the enemy at a distance.  In short, save\r\nfor sharp scuffles when the two champions are in touch, nothing happens\r\nthat deserves attention.  There is no duel to the death in the narrow\r\narena of the test-tube, any more than in the wider lists afforded by the\r\nbottle.  Utterly timid once she is away from home, the Spider obstinately\r\nrefuses the battle; nor will the Bumble-bee, giddy though she be, think\r\nof striking the first blow.  I abandon experiments in my study.\r\n\r\nWe must go direct to the spot and force the duel upon the Tarantula, who\r\nis full of pluck in her own stronghold.  Only, instead of the Bumble-bee,\r\nwho enters the burrow and conceals her death from our eyes, it is\r\nnecessary to substitute another adversary, less inclined to penetrate\r\nunderground.  There abounds in the garden, at this moment, on the flowers\r\nof the common clary, one of the largest and most powerful Bees that haunt\r\nmy district, the Carpenter-bee (_Xylocopa violacea_), clad in black\r\nvelvet, with wings of purple gauze.  Her size, which is nearly an inch,\r\nexceeds that of the Bumble-bee.  Her sting is excruciating and produces a\r\nswelling that long continues painful.  I have very exact memories on this\r\nsubject, memories that have cost me dear.  Here indeed is an antagonist\r\nworthy of the Tarantula, if I succeed in inducing the Spider to accept\r\nher.  I place a certain number, one by one, in bottles small in capacity,\r\nbut having a wide neck capable of surrounding the entrance to the burrow.\r\n\r\nAs the prey which I am about to offer is capable of overawing the\r\nhuntress, I select from among the Tarantulae the lustiest, the boldest,\r\nthose most stimulated by hunger.  The spikeleted stalk is pushed into the\r\nburrow.  When the Spider hastens up at once, when she is of a good size,\r\nwhen she climbs boldly to the aperture of her dwelling, she is admitted\r\nto the tourney; otherwise, she is refused.  The bottle, baited with a\r\nCarpenter-bee, is placed upside down over the door of one of the elect.\r\nThe Bee buzzes gravely in her glass bell; the huntress mounts from the\r\nrecesses of the cave; she is on the threshold, but inside; she looks; she\r\nwaits.  I also wait.  The quarters, the half-hours pass: nothing.  The\r\nSpider goes down again: she has probably judged the attempt too\r\ndangerous.  I move to a second, a third, a fourth burrow: still nothing;\r\nthe huntress refuses to leave her lair.\r\n\r\nFortune at last smiles upon my patience, which has been heavily tried by\r\nall these prudent retreats and particularly by the fierce heat of the dog-\r\ndays.  A Spider suddenly rushes from her hole: she has been rendered\r\nwarlike, doubtless, by prolonged abstinence.  The tragedy that happens\r\nunder the cover of the bottle lasts for but the twinkling of an eye.  It\r\nis over: the sturdy Carpenter-bee is dead.  Where did the murderess\r\nstrike her?  That is easily ascertained: the Tarantula has not let go;\r\nand her fangs are planted in the nape of the neck.  The assassin has the\r\nknowledge which I suspected: she has made for the essentially vital\r\ncentre, she has stung the insect's cervical ganglia with her\r\npoison-fangs.  In short, she has bitten the only point a lesion in which\r\nproduces sudden death.  I was delighted with this murderous skill, which\r\nmade amends for the blistering which my skin received in the sun.\r\n\r\nOnce is not custom: one swallow does not make a summer.  Is what I have\r\njust seen due to accident or to premeditation?  I turn to other Lycosae.\r\nMany, a deal too many for my patience, stubbornly refuse to dart from\r\ntheir haunts in order to attack the Carpenter-bee.  The formidable quarry\r\nis too much for their daring.  Shall not hunger, which brings the wolf\r\nfrom the wood, also bring the Tarantula out of her hole?  Two, apparently\r\nmore famished than the rest, do at last pounce upon the Bee and repeat\r\nthe scene of murder before my eyes.  The prey, again bitten in the neck,\r\nexclusively in the neck, dies on the instant.  Three murders, perpetrated\r\nin my presence under identical conditions, represent the fruits of my\r\nexperiment pursued, on two occasions, from eight o'clock in the morning\r\nuntil twelve midday.\r\n\r\nI had seen enough.  The quick insect-killer had taught me her trade as\r\nhad the paralyzer {10} before her: she had shown me that she is\r\nthoroughly versed in the art of the butcher of the Pampas. {11}  The\r\nTarantula is an accomplished _desnucador_.  It remained to me to confirm\r\nthe open-air experiment with experiments in the privacy of my study.  I\r\ntherefore got together a menagerie of these poisonous Spiders, so as to\r\njudge of the virulence of their venom and its effect according to the\r\npart of the body injured by the fangs.  A dozen bottles and test-tubes\r\nreceived the prisoners, whom I captured by the methods known to the\r\nreader.  To one inclined to scream at the sight of a Spider, my study,\r\nfilled with odious Lycosae, would have presented a very uncanny\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThough the Tarantula scorns or rather fears to attack an adversary placed\r\nin her presence in a bottle, she scarcely hesitates to bite what is\r\nthrust beneath her fangs.  I take her by the thorax with my forceps and\r\npresent to her mouth the animal which I wish stung.  Forthwith, if the\r\nSpider be not already tired by experiments, the fangs are raised and\r\ninserted.  I first tried the effects of the bite upon the Carpenter-bee.\r\nWhen struck in the neck, the Bee succumbs at once.  It was the lightning\r\ndeath which I witnessed on the threshold of the burrows.  When struck in\r\nthe abdomen and then placed in a large bottle that leaves its movements\r\nfree, the insect seems, at first, to have suffered no serious injury.  It\r\nflutters about and buzzes.  But half an hour has not elapsed before death\r\nis imminent.  The insect lies motionless upon its back or side.  At most,\r\na few movements of the legs, a slight pulsation of the belly, continuing\r\ntill the morrow, proclaim that life has not yet entirely departed.  Then\r\neverything ceases: the Carpenter-bee is a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this experiment compels our attention.  When stung in\r\nthe neck, the powerful Bee dies on the spot; and the Spider has not to\r\nfear the dangers of a desperate struggle.  Stung elsewhere, in the\r\nabdomen, the insect is capable, for nearly half an hour, of making use of\r\nits dart, its mandibles, its legs; and woe to the Lycosa whom the\r\nstiletto reaches.  I have seen some who, stabbed in the mouth while\r\nbiting close to the sting, died of the wound within the twenty-four\r\nhours.  That dangerous prey, therefore, requires instantaneous death,\r\nproduced by the injury to the nerve-centres of the neck; otherwise, the\r\nhunter's life would often be in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nThe Grasshopper order supplied me with a second series of victims: Green\r\nGrasshoppers as long as one's finger, large-headed Locusts, Ephippigerae.\r\n{12}  The same result follows when these are bitten in the neck:\r\nlightning death.  When injured elsewhere, notably in the abdomen, the\r\nsubject of the experiment resists for some time.  I have seen a\r\nGrasshopper, bitten in the belly, cling firmly for fifteen hours to the\r\nsmooth, upright wall of the glass bell that constituted his prison.  At\r\nlast, he dropped off and died.  Where the Bee, that delicate organism,\r\nsuccumbs in less than half an hour, the Grasshopper, coarse ruminant that\r\nhe is, resists for a whole day.  Put aside these differences, caused by\r\nunequal degrees of organic sensitiveness, and we sum up as follows: when\r\nbitten by the Tarantula in the neck, an insect, chosen from among the\r\nlargest, dies on the spot; when bitten elsewhere, it perishes also, but\r\nafter a lapse of time which varies considerably in the different\r\nentomological orders.\r\n\r\nThis explains the long hesitation of the Tarantula, so wearisome to the\r\nexperimenter when he presents to her, at the entrance to the burrow, a\r\nrich, but dangerous prey.  The majority refuse to fling themselves upon\r\nthe Carpenter-bee.  The fact is that a quarry of this kind cannot be\r\nseized recklessly: the huntress who missed her stroke by biting at random\r\nwould do so at the risk of her life.  The nape of the neck alone\r\npossesses the desired vulnerability.  The adversary must be nipped there\r\nand no elsewhere.  Not to floor her at once would mean to irritate her\r\nand make her more dangerous than ever.  The Spider is well aware of this.\r\nIn the safe shelter of her threshold, therefore, prepared to beat a quick\r\nretreat if necessary, she watches for the favourable moment; she waits\r\nfor the big Bee to face her, when the neck is easily grabbed.  If this\r\ncondition of success offer, she leaps out and acts; if not, weary of the\r\nviolent evolutions of the quarry, she retires indoors.  And that, no\r\ndoubt, is why it took me two sittings of four hours apiece to witness\r\nthree assassinations.\r\n\r\nFormerly, instructed by the paralysing Wasps, I had myself tried to\r\nproduce paralysis by injecting a drop of ammonia into the thorax of those\r\ninsects, such as Weevils, Buprestes, {13} and Dung-beetles, whose compact\r\nnervous system assists this physiological operation.  I showed myself a\r\nready pupil to my masters' teaching and used to paralyze a Buprestis or a\r\nWeevil almost as well as a Cerceris {14} could have done.  Why should I\r\nnot to-day imitate that expert butcher, the Tarantula?  With the point of\r\na fine needle, I inject a tiny drop of ammonia at the base of the skull\r\nof a Carpenter-bee or a Grasshopper.  The insect succumbs then and there,\r\nwithout any other movement than wild convulsions.  When attacked by the\r\nacrid fluid, the cervical ganglia cease to do their work; and death\r\nensues.  Nevertheless, this death is not immediate; the throes last for\r\nsome time.  The experiment is not wholly satisfactory as regards\r\nsuddenness.  Why?  Because the liquid which I employ, ammonia, cannot be\r\ncompared, for deadly efficacy, with the Lycosa's poison, a pretty\r\nformidable poison, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nI make a Tarantula bite the leg of a young, well-fledged Sparrow, ready\r\nto leave the nest.  A drop of blood flows; the wounded spot is surrounded\r\nby a reddish circle, changing to purple.  The bird almost immediately\r\nloses the use of its leg, which drags, with the toes doubled in; it hops\r\nupon the other.  Apart from this, the patient does not seem to trouble\r\nmuch about his hurt; his appetite is good.  My daughters feed him on\r\nFlies, bread-crumb, apricot-pulp.  He is sure to get well, he will\r\nrecover his strength; the poor victim of the curiosity of science will be\r\nrestored to liberty.  This is the wish, the intention of us all.  Twelve\r\nhours later, the hope of a cure increases; the invalid takes nourishment\r\nreadily; he clamours for it, if we keep him waiting.  But the leg still\r\ndrags.  I set this down to a temporary paralysis which will soon\r\ndisappear.  Two days after, he refuses his food.  Wrapping himself in his\r\nstoicism and his rumpled feathers, the Sparrow hunches into a ball, now\r\nmotionless, now twitching.  My girls take him in the hollow of their\r\nhands and warm him with their breath.  The spasms become more frequent.  A\r\ngasp proclaims that all is over.  The bird is dead.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain coolness among us at the evening-meal.  I read mute\r\nreproaches, because of my experiment, in the eyes of my home-circle; I\r\nread an unspoken accusation of cruelty all around me.  The death of the\r\nunfortunate Sparrow had saddened the whole family.  I myself was not\r\nwithout some remorse of conscience: the poor result achieved seemed to me\r\ntoo dearly bought.  I am not made of the stuff of those who, without\r\nturning a hair, rip up live Dogs to find out nothing in particular.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I had the courage to start afresh, this time on a Mole\r\ncaught ravaging a bed of lettuces.  There was a danger lest my captive,\r\nwith his famished stomach, should leave things in doubt, if we had to\r\nkeep him for a few days.  He might die not of his wound, but of\r\ninanition, if I did not succeed in giving him suitable food, fairly\r\nplentiful and dispensed at fairly frequent intervals.  In that case, I\r\nran a risk of ascribing to the poison what might well be the result of\r\nstarvation.  I must therefore begin by finding out if it was possible for\r\nme to keep the Mole alive in captivity.  The animal was put into a large\r\nreceptacle from which it could not get out and fed on a varied diet of\r\ninsects--Beetles, Grasshoppers, especially Cicadae {15}--which it\r\ncrunched up with an excellent appetite.  Twenty-four hours of this\r\nregimen convinced me that the Mole was making the best of the bill of\r\nfare and taking kindly to his captivity.\r\n\r\nI make the Tarantula bite him at the tip of the snout.  When replaced in\r\nhis cage, the Mole keeps on scratching his nose with his broad paws.  The\r\nthing seems to burn, to itch.  Henceforth, less and less of the provision\r\nof Cicadae is consumed; on the evening of the following day, it is\r\nrefused altogether.  About thirty-six hours after being bitten, the Mole\r\ndies during the night and certainly not from inanition, for there are\r\nstill half a dozen live Cicadae in the receptacle, as well as a few\r\nBeetles.\r\n\r\nThe bite of the Black-bellied Tarantula is therefore dangerous to other\r\nanimals than insects: it is fatal to the Sparrow, it is fatal to the\r\nMole.  Up to what point are we to generalize?  I do not know, because my\r\nenquiries extended no further.  Nevertheless, judging from the little\r\nthat I saw, it appears to me that the bite of this Spider is not an\r\naccident which man can afford to treat lightly.  This is all that I have\r\nto say to the doctors.\r\n\r\nTo the philosophical entomologists I have something else to say: I have\r\nto call their attention to the consummate knowledge of the\r\ninsect-killers, which vies with that of the paralyzers.  I speak of\r\ninsect-killers in the plural, for the Tarantula must share her deadly art\r\nwith a host of other Spiders, especially with those who hunt without\r\nnets.  These insect-killers, who live on their prey, strike the game dead\r\ninstantaneously by stinging the nerve-centres of the neck; the\r\nparalyzers, on the other hand, who wish to keep the food fresh for their\r\nlarvae, destroy the power of movement by stinging the game in the other\r\nnerve-centres.  Both of them attack the nervous chain, but they select\r\nthe point according to the object to be attained.  If death be desired,\r\nsudden death, free from danger to the huntress, the insect is attacked in\r\nthe neck; if mere paralysis be required, the neck is respected and the\r\nlower segments--sometimes one alone, sometimes three, sometimes all or\r\nnearly all, according to the special organization of the victim--receive\r\nthe dagger-thrust.\r\n\r\nEven the paralyzers, at least some of them, are acquainted with the\r\nimmense vital importance of the nerve-centres of the neck.  We have seen\r\nthe Hairy Ammophila munching the caterpillar's brain, the Languedocian\r\nSphex munching the brain of the Ephippigera, with the object of inducing\r\na passing torpor.  But they simply squeeze the brain and do even this\r\nwith a wise discretion; they are careful not to drive their sting into\r\nthis fundamental centre of life; not one of them ever thinks of doing so,\r\nfor the result would be a corpse which the larva would despise.  The\r\nSpider, on the other hand, inserts her double dirk there and there alone;\r\nany elsewhere it would inflict a wound likely to increase resistance\r\nthrough irritation.  She wants a venison for consumption without delay\r\nand brutally thrusts her fangs into the spot which the others so\r\nconscientiously respect.\r\n\r\nIf the instinct of these scientific murderers is not, in both cases, an\r\ninborn predisposition, inseparable from the animal, but an acquired\r\nhabit, then I rack my brain in vain to understand how that habit can have\r\nbeen acquired.  Shroud these facts in theoretic mists as much as you\r\nwill, you shall never succeed in veiling the glaring evidence which they\r\nafford of a pre-established order of things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: THE BANDED EPEIRA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the inclement season of the year, when the insect has nothing to do\r\nand retires to winter quarters, the observer profits by the mildness of\r\nthe sunny nooks and grubs in the sand, lifts the stones, searches the\r\nbrushwood; and often he is stirred with a pleasurable excitement, when he\r\nlights upon some ingenious work of art, discovered unawares.  Happy are\r\nthe simple of heart whose ambition is satisfied with such treasure-trove!\r\nI wish them all the joys which it has brought me and which it will\r\ncontinue to bring me, despite the vexations of life, which grow ever more\r\nbitter as the years follow their swift downward course.\r\n\r\nShould the seekers rummage among the wild grasses in the osier-beds and\r\ncopses, I wish them the delight of finding the wonderful object that, at\r\nthis moment, lies before my eyes.  It is the work of a Spider, the nest\r\nof the Banded Epeira (_Epeira fasciata_, LATR.).\r\n\r\nA Spider is not an insect, according to the rules of classification; and\r\nas such the Epeira seems out of place here. {16}  A fig for systems!  It\r\nis immaterial to the student of instinct whether the animal have eight\r\nlegs instead of six, or pulmonary sacs instead of air-tubes.  Besides,\r\nthe Araneida belong to the group of segmented animals, organized in\r\nsections placed end to end, a structure to which the terms 'insect' and\r\n'entomology' both refer.\r\n\r\nFormerly, to describe this group, people said 'articulate animals,' an\r\nexpression which possessed the drawback of not jarring on the ear and of\r\nbeing understood by all.  This is out of date.  Nowadays, they use the\r\neuphonious term 'Arthropoda.'  And to think that there are men who\r\nquestion the existence of progress!  Infidels!  Say, 'articulate,' first;\r\nthen roll out, 'Arthropoda;' and you shall see whether zoological science\r\nis not progressing!\r\n\r\nIn bearing and colouring, _Epeira fasciata_ is the handsomest of the\r\nSpiders of the South.  On her fat belly, a mighty silk-warehouse nearly\r\nas large as a hazel-nut, are alternate yellow, black and silver sashes,\r\nto which she owes her epithet of Banded.  Around that portly abdomen, the\r\neight long legs, with their dark- and pale-brown rings, radiate like\r\nspokes.\r\n\r\nAny small prey suits her; and, as long as she can find supports for her\r\nweb, she settles wherever the Locust hops, wherever the Fly hovers,\r\nwherever the Dragon-fly dances or the Butterfly flits.  As a rule,\r\nbecause of the greater abundance of game, she spreads her toils across\r\nsome brooklet, from bank to bank among the rushes.  She also stretches\r\nthem, but not assiduously, in the thickets of evergreen oak, on the\r\nslopes with the scrubby greenswards, dear to the Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nHer hunting-weapon is a large upright web, whose outer boundary, which\r\nvaries according to the disposition of the ground, is fastened to the\r\nneighbouring branches by a number of moorings.  The structure is that\r\nadopted by the other weaving Spiders.  Straight threads radiate at equal\r\nintervals from a central point.  Over this framework runs a continuous\r\nspiral thread, forming chords, or cross-bars, from the centre to the\r\ncircumference.  It is magnificently large and magnificently symmetrical.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the web, starting from the centre, a wide opaque\r\nribbon descends zigzag-wise across the radii.  This is the Epeira's trade-\r\nmark, the flourish of an artist initialling his creation.  '_Fecit_ So-\r\nand-so,' she seems to say, when giving the last throw of the shuttle to\r\nher handiwork.\r\n\r\nThat the Spider feels satisfied when, after passing and repassing from\r\nspoke to spoke, she finishes her spiral, is beyond a doubt: the work\r\nachieved ensures her food for a few days to come.  But, in this\r\nparticular case, the vanity of the spinstress has naught to say to the\r\nmatter: the strong silk zigzag is added to impart greater firmness to the\r\nweb.\r\n\r\nIncreased resistance is not superfluous, for the net is sometimes exposed\r\nto severe tests.  The Epeira cannot pick and choose her prizes.  Seated\r\nmotionless in the centre of her web, her eight legs wide-spread to feel\r\nthe shaking of the network in any direction, she waits for what luck will\r\nbring her: now some giddy weakling unable to control its flight, anon\r\nsome powerful prey rushing headlong with a reckless bound.\r\n\r\nThe Locust in particular, the fiery Locust, who releases the spring of\r\nhis long shanks at random, often falls into the trap.  One imagines that\r\nhis strength ought to frighten the Spider; the kick of his spurred levers\r\nshould enable him to make a hole, then and there, in the web and to get\r\naway.  But not at all.  If he does not free himself at the first effort,\r\nthe Locust is lost.\r\n\r\nTurning her back on the game, the Epeira works all her spinnerets,\r\npierced like the rose of a watering-pot, at one and the same time.  The\r\nsilky spray is gathered by the hind-legs, which are longer than the\r\nothers and open into a wide arc to allow the stream to spread.  Thanks to\r\nthis artifice, the Epeira this time obtains not a thread, but an\r\niridescent sheet, a sort of clouded fan wherein the component threads are\r\nkept almost separate.  The two hind-legs fling this shroud gradually, by\r\nrapid alternate armfuls, while, at the same time, they turn the prey over\r\nand over, swathing it completely.\r\n\r\nThe ancient _retiarius_, when pitted against a powerful wild beast,\r\nappeared in the arena with a rope-net folded over his left shoulder.  The\r\nanimal made its spring.  The man, with a sudden movement of his right\r\narm, cast the net after the manner of the fishermen; he covered the beast\r\nand tangled it in the meshes.  A thrust of the trident gave the quietus\r\nto the vanquished foe.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira acts in like fashion, with this advantage, that she is able to\r\nrenew her armful of fetters.  Should the first not suffice, a second\r\ninstantly follows and another and yet another, until the reserves of silk\r\nbecome exhausted.\r\n\r\nWhen all movement ceases under the snowy winding-sheet, the Spider goes\r\nup to her bound prisoner.  She has a better weapon than the _bestiarius_'\r\ntrident: she has her poison-fangs.  She gnaws at the Locust, without\r\nundue persistence, and then withdraws, leaving the torpid patient to pine\r\naway.\r\n\r\nSoon she comes back to her motionless head of game: she sucks it, drains\r\nit, repeatedly changing her point of attack.  At last, the clean-bled\r\nremains are flung out of the net and the Spider returns to her ambush in\r\nthe centre of the web.\r\n\r\nWhat the Epeira sucks is not a corpse, but a numbed body.  If I remove\r\nthe Locust immediately after he has been bitten and release him from the\r\nsilken sheath, the patient recovers his strength to such an extent that\r\nhe seems, at first, to have suffered no injury.  The Spider, therefore,\r\ndoes not kill her capture before sucking its juices; she is content to\r\ndeprive it of the power of motion by producing a state of torpor.  Perhaps\r\nthis kindlier bite gives her greater facility in working her pump.  The\r\nhumours, if stagnant, in a corpse, would not respond so readily to the\r\naction of the sucker; they are more easily extracted from a live body, in\r\nwhich they move about.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira, therefore, being a drinker of blood, moderates the virulence\r\nof her sting, even with victims of appalling size, so sure is she of her\r\nretiarian art.  The long-legged Tryxalis, {17} the corpulent Grey Locust,\r\nthe largest of our Grasshoppers are accepted without hesitation and\r\nsucked dry as soon as numbed.  Those giants, capable of making a hole in\r\nthe net and passing through it in their impetuous onrush, can be but\r\nrarely caught.  I myself place them on the web.  The Spider does the\r\nrest.  Lavishing her silky spray, she swathes them and then sucks the\r\nbody at her ease.  With an increased expenditure of the spinnerets, the\r\nvery biggest game is mastered as successfully as the everyday prey.\r\n\r\nI have seen even better than that.  This time, my subject is the Silky\r\nEpeira (_Epeira sericea_, OLIV.), with a broad, festooned, silvery\r\nabdomen.  Like that of the other, her web is large, upright and 'signed'\r\nwith a zigzag ribbon.  I place upon it a Praying Mantis, {18} a\r\nwell-developed specimen, quite capable of changing roles, should\r\ncircumstances permit, and herself making a meal off her assailant.  It is\r\na question no longer of capturing a peaceful Locust, but a fierce and\r\npowerful ogre, who would rip open the Epeira's paunch with one blow of\r\nher harpoons.\r\n\r\nWill the Spider dare?  Not immediately.  Motionless in the centre of her\r\nnet, she consults her strength before attacking the formidable quarry;\r\nshe waits until the struggling prey has its claws more thickly entangled.\r\nAt last, she approaches.  The Mantis curls her belly; lifts her wings\r\nlike vertical sails; opens her saw-toothed arm-pieces; in short, adopts\r\nthe spectral attitude which she employs when delivering battle.\r\n\r\nThe Spider disregards these menaces.  Spreading wide her spinnerets, she\r\npumps out sheets of silk which the hind-legs draw out, expand and fling\r\nwithout stint in alternate armfuls.  Under this shower of threads, the\r\nMantis' terrible saws, the lethal legs, quickly disappear from sight, as\r\ndo the wings, still erected in the spectral posture.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the swathed one gives sudden jerks, which make the Spider fall\r\nout of her web.  The accident is provided for.  A safety-cord, emitted at\r\nthe same instant by the spinnerets, keeps the Epeira hanging, swinging in\r\nspace.  When calm is restored, she packs her cord and climbs up again.\r\nThe heavy paunch and the hind-legs are now bound.  The flow slackens, the\r\nsilk comes only in thin sheets.  Fortunately, the business is done.  The\r\nprey is invisible under the thick shroud.\r\n\r\nThe Spider retires without giving a bite.  To master the terrible quarry,\r\nshe has spent the whole reserves of her spinning-mill, enough to weave\r\nmany good-sized webs.  With this heap of shackles, further precautions\r\nare superfluous.\r\n\r\nAfter a short rest in the centre of the net, she comes down to dinner.\r\nSlight incisions are made in different parts of the prize, now here, now\r\nthere; and the Spider puts her mouth to each and sucks the blood of her\r\nprey.  The meal is long protracted, so rich is the dish.  For ten hours,\r\nI watch the insatiable glutton, who changes her point of attack as each\r\nwound sucked dries up.  Night comes and robs me of the finish of the\r\nunbridled debauch.  Next morning, the drained Mantis lies upon the\r\nground.  The Ants are eagerly devouring the remains.\r\n\r\nThe eminent talents of the Epeirae are displayed to even better purpose\r\nin the industrial business of motherhood than in the art of the chase.\r\nThe silk bag, the nest, in which the Banded Epeira houses her eggs, is a\r\nmuch greater marvel than the bird's nest.  In shape, it is an inverted\r\nballoon, nearly the size of a Pigeon's egg.  The top tapers like a pear\r\nand is cut short and crowned with a scalloped rim, the corners of which\r\nare lengthened by means of moorings that fasten the object to the\r\nadjoining twigs.  The whole, a graceful ovoid, hangs straight down, amid\r\na few threads that steady it.\r\n\r\nThe top is hollowed into a crater closed with a silky padding.  Every\r\nother part is contained in the general wrapper, formed of thick, compact\r\nwhite satin, difficult to break and impervious to moisture.  Brown and\r\neven black silk, laid out in abroad ribbons, in spindle-shaped patterns,\r\nin fanciful meridian waves, adorns the upper portion of the exterior.  The\r\npart played by this fabric is self-evident: it is a waterproof cover\r\nwhich neither dew nor rain can penetrate.\r\n\r\nExposed to all the inclemencies of the weather, among the dead grasses,\r\nclose to the ground, the Epeira's nest has also to protect its contents\r\nfrom the winter cold.  Let us cut the wrapper with our scissors.\r\nUnderneath, we find a thick layer of reddish-brown silk, not worked into\r\na fabric this time, but puffed into an extra-fine wadding.  It is a\r\nfleecy cloud, an incomparable quilt, softer than any swan's-down.  This\r\nis the screen set up against loss of heat.\r\n\r\nAnd what does this cosy mass protect?  See: in the middle of the\r\neiderdown hangs a cylindrical pocket, round at the bottom, cut square at\r\nthe top and closed with a padded lid.  It is made of extremely fine\r\nsatin; it contains the Epeira's eggs, pretty little orange-coloured\r\nbeads, which, glued together, form a globule the size of a pea.  This is\r\nthe treasure to be defended against the asperities of the winter.\r\n\r\nNow that we know the structure of the work, let us try to see in what\r\nmanner the spinstress sets about it.  The observation is not an easy one,\r\nfor the Banded Epeira is a night-worker.  She needs nocturnal quiet in\r\norder not to go astray amid the complicated rules that guide her\r\nindustry.  Now and again, at very early hours in the morning, I have\r\nhappened to catch her working, which enables me to sum up the progress of\r\nthe operations.\r\n\r\nMy subjects are busy in their bell-shaped cages, at about the middle of\r\nAugust.  A scaffolding is first run up, at the top of the dome; it\r\nconsists of a few stretched threads.  The wire trellis represents the\r\ntwigs and the blades of grass which the Spider, if at liberty, would have\r\nused as suspension-points.  The loom works on this shaky support.  The\r\nEpeira does not see what she is doing; she turns her back on her task.\r\nThe machinery is so well put together that the whole thing goes\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nThe tip of the abdomen sways, a little to the right, a little to the\r\nleft, rises and falls, while the Spider moves slowly round and round.  The\r\nthread paid out is single.  The hind-legs draw it out and place it in\r\nposition on that which is already done.  Thus is formed a satin\r\nreceptacle the rim of which is gradually raised until it becomes a bag\r\nabout a centimetre deep. {19}  The texture is of the daintiest.  Guy-ropes\r\nbind it to the nearest threads and keep it stretched, especially at the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThen the spinnerets take a rest and the turn of the ovaries comes.  A\r\ncontinuous shower of eggs falls into the bag, which is filled to the top.\r\nThe capacity of the receptacle has been so nicely calculated that there\r\nis room for all the eggs, without leaving any space unoccupied.  When the\r\nSpider has finished and retires, I catch a momentary glimpse of the heap\r\nof orange-coloured eggs; but the work of the spinnerets is at once\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nThe next business is to close the bag.  The machinery works a little\r\ndifferently.  The tip of the belly no longer sways from side to side.  It\r\nsinks and touches a point; it retreats, sinks again and touches another\r\npoint, first here, then there, describing inextricable zigzags.  At the\r\nsame time, the hind-legs tread the material emitted.  The result is no\r\nlonger a stuff, but a felt, a blanketing.\r\n\r\nAround the satin capsule, which contains the eggs, is the eiderdown\r\ndestined to keep out the cold.  The youngsters will bide for some time in\r\nthis soft shelter, to strengthen their joints and prepare for the final\r\nexodus.  It does not take long to make.  The spinning-mill suddenly\r\nalters the raw material: it was turning out white silk; it now furnishes\r\nreddish-brown silk, finer than the other and issuing in clouds which the\r\nhind-legs, those dexterous carders, beat into a sort of froth.  The egg-\r\npocket disappears, drowned in this exquisite wadding.\r\n\r\nThe balloon-shape is already outlined; the top of the work tapers to a\r\nneck.  The Spider, moving up and down, tacking first to one side and then\r\nto the other, from the very first spray marks out the graceful form as\r\naccurately as though she carried a compass in her abdomen.\r\n\r\nThen, once again, with the same suddenness, the material changes.  The\r\nwhite silk reappears, wrought into thread.  This is the moment to weave\r\nthe outer wrapper.  Because of the thickness of the stuff and the density\r\nof its texture, this operation is the longest of the series.\r\n\r\nFirst, a few threads are flung out, hither and thither, to keep the layer\r\nof wadding in position.  The Epeira takes special pains with the edge of\r\nthe neck, where she fashions an indented border, the angles of which,\r\nprolonged with cords or lines, form the main support of the building.  The\r\nspinnerets never touch this part without giving it, each time, until the\r\nend of the work, a certain added solidity, necessary to secure the\r\nstability of the balloon.  The suspensory indentations soon outline a\r\ncrater which needs plugging.  The Spider closes the bag with a padded\r\nstopper similar to that with which she sealed the egg-pocket.\r\n\r\nWhen these arrangements are made, the real manufacture of the wrapper\r\nbegins.  The Spider goes backwards and forwards, turns and turns again.\r\nThe spinnerets do not touch the fabric.  With a rhythmical, alternate\r\nmovement, the hind-legs, the sole implements employed, draw the thread,\r\nseize it in their combs and apply it to the work, while the tip of the\r\nabdomen sways methodically to and fro.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the silken fibre is distributed in an even zigzag, of almost\r\ngeometrical precision and comparable with that of the cotton thread which\r\nthe machines in our factories roll so neatly into balls.  And this is\r\nrepeated all over the surface of the work, for the Spider shifts her\r\nposition a little at every moment.\r\n\r\nAt fairly frequent intervals, the tip of the abdomen is lifted to the\r\nmouth of the balloon; and then the spinnerets really touch the fringed\r\nedge.  The length of contact is even considerable.  We find, therefore,\r\nthat the thread is stuck in this star-shaped fringe, the foundation of\r\nthe building and the crux of the whole, while every elsewhere it is\r\nsimply laid on, in a manner determined by the movements of the hind-legs.\r\nIf we wished to unwind the work, the thread would break at the margin; at\r\nany other point, it would unroll.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira ends her web with a dead-white, angular flourish; she ends her\r\nnest with brown mouldings, which run down, irregularly, from the marginal\r\njunction to the bulging middle.  For this purpose, she makes use, for the\r\nthird time, of a different silk; she now produces silk of a dark hue,\r\nvarying from russet to black.  The spinnerets distribute the material\r\nwith a wide longitudinal swing, from pole to pole; and the hind-legs\r\napply it in capricious ribbons.  When this is done, the work is finished.\r\nThe Spider moves away with slow strides, without giving a glance at the\r\nbag.  The rest does not interest her: time and the sun will see to it.\r\n\r\nShe felt her hour at hand and came down from her web.  Near by, in the\r\nrank grass, she wove the tabernacle of her offspring and, in so doing,\r\ndrained her resources.  To resume her hunting-post, to return to her web\r\nwould be useless to her: she has not the wherewithal to bind the prey.\r\nBesides, the fine appetite of former days has gone.  Withered and\r\nlanguid, she drags out her existence for a few days and, at last, dies.\r\nThis is how things happen in my cages; this is how they must happen in\r\nthe brushwood.\r\n\r\nThe Silky Epeira (_Epeira sericea_, OLIV.) excels the Banded Epeira in\r\nthe manufacture of big hunting-nets, but she is less gifted in the art of\r\nnest-building.  She gives her nest the inelegant form of an obtuse cone.\r\nThe opening of this pocket is very wide and is scalloped into lobes by\r\nwhich the edifice is slung.  It is closed with a large lid, half satin,\r\nhalf swan's-down.  The rest is a stout white fabric, frequently covered\r\nwith irregular brown streaks.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the work of the two Epeirae does not extend beyond\r\nthe wrapper, which is an obtuse cone in the one case and a balloon in the\r\nother.  The same internal arrangements prevail behind this frontage:\r\nfirst, a flossy quilt; next, a little keg in which the eggs are packed.\r\nThough the two Spiders build the outer wall according to special\r\narchitectural rules, they both employ the same means as a protection\r\nagainst the cold.\r\n\r\nAs we see, the egg-bag of the Epeirae, particularly that of the Banded\r\nEpeira, is an important and complex work.  Various materials enter into\r\nits composition: white silk, red silk, brown silk; moreover, these\r\nmaterials are worked into dissimilar products: stout cloth, soft\r\neiderdown, dainty satinette, porous felt.  And all of this comes from the\r\nsame workshop that weaves the hunting-net, warps the zigzag ribbon-band\r\nand casts an entangling shroud over the prey.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful silk-factory it is!  With a very simple and\r\nnever-varying plant, consisting of the hind-legs and the spinnerets, it\r\nproduces, by turns, rope-maker's, spinner's, weaver's, ribbon-maker's and\r\nfuller's work.  How does the Spider direct an establishment of this kind?\r\nHow does she obtain, at will, skeins of diverse hues and grades?  How\r\ndoes she turn them out, first in this fashion, then in that?  I see the\r\nresults, but I do not understand the machinery and still less the\r\nprocess.  It beats me altogether.\r\n\r\nThe Spider also sometimes loses her head in her difficult trade, when\r\nsome trouble disturbs the peace of her nocturnal labours.  I do not\r\nprovoke this trouble myself, for I am not present at those unseasonable\r\nhours.  It is simply due to the conditions prevailing in my menagerie.\r\n\r\nIn their natural state, the Epeirae settle separately, at long distances\r\nfrom one another.  Each has her own hunting-grounds, where there is no\r\nreason to fear the competition that would result from the close proximity\r\nof the nets.  In my cages, on the other hand, there is cohabitation.  In\r\norder to save space, I lodge two or three Epeirae in the same cage.  My\r\neasy-going captives live together in peace.  There is no strife between\r\nthem, no encroaching on the neighbour's property.  Each of them weaves\r\nherself a rudimentary web, as far from the rest as possible, and here,\r\nrapt in contemplation, as though indifferent to what the others are\r\ndoing, she awaits the hop of the Locust.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these close quarters have their drawbacks when laying-time\r\narrives.  The cords by which the different establishments are hung\r\ninterlace and criss-cross in a confused network.  When one of them\r\nshakes, all the others are more or less affected.  This is enough to\r\ndistract the layer from her business and to make her do silly things.\r\nHere are two instances.\r\n\r\nA bag has been woven during the night.  I find it, when I visit the cage\r\nin the morning, hanging from the trellis-work and completed.  It is\r\nperfect, as regards structure; it is decorated with the regulation black\r\nmeridian curves.  There is nothing missing, nothing except the essential\r\nthing, the eggs, for which the spinstress has gone to such expense in the\r\nmatter of silks.  Where are the eggs?  They are not in the bag, which I\r\nopen and find empty.  They are lying on the ground below, on the sand in\r\nthe pan, utterly unprotected.\r\n\r\nDisturbed at the moment of discharging them, the mother has missed the\r\nmouth of the little bag and dropped them on the floor.  Perhaps even, in\r\nher excitement, she came down from above and, compelled by the exigencies\r\nof the ovaries, laid her eggs on the first support that offered.  No\r\nmatter: if her Spider brain contains the least gleam of sense, she must\r\nbe aware of the disaster and is therefore bound at once to abandon the\r\nelaborate manufacture of a now superfluous nest.\r\n\r\nNot at all: the bag is woven around nothing, as accurate in shape, as\r\nfinished in structure as under normal conditions.  The absurd\r\nperseverance displayed by certain Bees, whose egg and provisions I used\r\nto remove, {20} is here repeated without the slightest interference from\r\nme.  My victims used scrupulously to seal up their empty cells.  In the\r\nsame way, the Epeira puts the eiderdown quilting and the taffeta wrapper\r\nround a capsule that contains nothing.\r\n\r\nAnother, distracted from her work by some startling vibration, leaves her\r\nnest at the moment when the layer of red-brown wadding is being\r\ncompleted.  She flees to the dome, at a few inches above her unfinished\r\nwork, and spends upon a shapeless mattress, of no use whatever, all the\r\nsilk with which she would have woven the outer wrapper if nothing had\r\ncome to disturb her.\r\n\r\nPoor fool!  You upholster the wires of your cage with swan's-down and you\r\nleave the eggs imperfectly protected.  The absence of the work already\r\nexecuted and the hardness of the metal do not warn you that you are now\r\nengaged upon a senseless task.  You remind me of the Pelopaeus, {21} who\r\nused to coat with mud the place on the wall whence her nest had been\r\nremoved.  You speak to me, in your own fashion, of a strange psychology\r\nwhich is able to reconcile the wonders of a master craftsmanship with\r\naberrations due to unfathomable stupidity.\r\n\r\nLet us compare the work of the Banded Epeira with that of the Penduline\r\nTitmouse, the cleverest of our small birds in the art of nest-building.\r\nThis Tit haunts the osier-beds of the lower reaches of the Rhone.  Rocking\r\ngently in the river breeze, his nest sways pendent over the peaceful\r\nbackwaters, at some distance from the too-impetuous current.  It hangs\r\nfrom the drooping end of the branch of a poplar, an old willow or an\r\nalder, all of them tall trees, favouring the banks of streams.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a cotton bag, closed all round, save for a small opening\r\nat the side, just sufficient to allow of the mother's passage.  In shape,\r\nit resembles the body of an alembic, a chemist's retort with a short\r\nlateral neck, or, better still, the foot of a stocking, with the edges\r\nbrought together, but for a little round hole left at one side.  The\r\noutward appearances increase the likeness: one can almost see the traces\r\nof a knitting-needle working with coarse stitches.  That is why, struck\r\nby this shape, the Provencal peasant, in his expressive language, calls\r\nthe Penduline _lou Debassaire_, the Stocking-knitter.\r\n\r\nThe early-ripening seedlets of the widows and poplars furnish the\r\nmaterials for the work.  There breaks from them, in May, a sort of vernal\r\nsnow, a fine down, which the eddies of the air heap in the crevices of\r\nthe ground.  It is a cotton similar to that of our manufactures, but of\r\nvery short staple.  It comes from an inexhaustible warehouse: the tree is\r\nbountiful; and the wind from the osier-beds gathers the tiny flocks as\r\nthey pour from the seeds.  They are easy to pick up.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is to set to work.  How does the bird proceed, in order to\r\nknit its stocking?  How, with such simple implements as its beak and\r\nclaws, does it manage to produce a fabric which our skilled fingers would\r\nfail to achieve?  An examination of the nest will inform us, to a certain\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe cotton of the poplar cannot, of itself, supply a hanging pocket\r\ncapable of supporting the weight of the brood and resisting the buffeting\r\nof the wind.  Rammed, entangled and packed together, the flocks, similar\r\nto those which ordinary wadding would give if chopped up very fine, would\r\nproduce only an agglomeration devoid of cohesion and liable to be\r\ndispelled by the first breath of air.  They require a canvas, a warp, to\r\nkeep them in position.\r\n\r\nTiny dead stalks, with fibrous barks, well softened by the action of\r\nmoisture and the air, furnish the Penduline with a coarse tow, not unlike\r\nthat of hemp.  With these ligaments, purged of every woody particle and\r\ntested for flexibility and tenacity, he winds a number of loops round the\r\nend of the branch which he has selected as a support for his structure.\r\n\r\nIt is not a very accurate piece of work.  The loops run clumsily and\r\nanyhow: some are slacker, others tighter; but, when all is said, it is\r\nsolid, which is the main point.  Also, this fibrous sheath, the keystone\r\nof the edifice, occupies a fair length of branch, which enables the\r\nfastenings for the net to be multiplied.\r\n\r\nThe several straps, after describing a certain number of turns, ravel out\r\nat the ends and hang loose.  After them come interlaced threads, greater\r\nin number and finer in texture.  In the tangled jumble occur what might\r\nalmost be described as weaver's knots.  As far as one can judge by the\r\nresult alone, without having seen the bird at work, this is how the\r\ncanvas, the support of the cotton wall, is obtained.\r\n\r\nThis warp, this inner framework, is obviously not constructed in its\r\nentirety from the start; it goes on gradually, as the bird stuffs the\r\npart above it with cotton.  The wadding, picked up bit by bit from the\r\nground, is teazled by the bird's claws and inserted, all fleecy, into the\r\nmeshes of the canvas.  The beak pushes it, the breast presses it, both\r\ninside and out.  The result is a soft felt a couple of inches thick.\r\n\r\nNear the top of the pouch, on one side, is contrived a narrow orifice,\r\ntapering into a short neck.  This is the kitchen-door.  In order to pass\r\nthrough it, the Penduline, small though he be, has to force the elastic\r\npartition, which yields slightly and then contracts.  Lastly, the house\r\nis furnished with a mattress of first-quality cotton.  Here lie from six\r\nto eight white eggs, the size of a cherry-stone.\r\n\r\nWell, this wonderful nest is a barbarous casemate compared with that of\r\nthe Banded Epeira.  As regards shape, this stocking-foot cannot be\r\nmentioned in the same breath with the Spider's elegant and faultlessly-\r\nrounded balloon.  The fabric of mixed cotton and tow is a rustic frieze\r\nbeside the spinstress' satin; the suspension-straps are clumsy cables\r\ncompared with her delicate silk fastenings.  Where shall we find in the\r\nPenduline's mattress aught to vie with the Epeira's eiderdown, that\r\nteazled russet gossamer?  The Spider is superior to the bird in every\r\nway, in so far as concerns her work.\r\n\r\nBut, on her side, the Penduline is a more devoted mother.  For weeks on\r\nend, squatting at the bottom of her purse, she presses to her heart the\r\neggs, those little white pebbles from which the warmth of her body will\r\nbring forth life.  The Epeira knows not these softer passions.  Without\r\nbestowing a second glance an it, she abandons her nest to its fate, be it\r\ngood or ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III: THE NARBONNE LYCOSA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epeira, who displays such astonishing industry to give her eggs a\r\ndwelling-house of incomparable perfection, becomes, after that, careless\r\nof her family.  For what reason?  She lacks the time.  She has to die\r\nwhen the first cold comes, whereas the eggs are destined to pass the\r\nwinter in their downy snuggery.  The desertion of the nest is inevitable,\r\nowing to the very force of things.  But, if the hatching were earlier and\r\ntook place in the Epeira's lifetime, I imagine that she would rival the\r\nbird in devotion.\r\n\r\nSo I gather from the analogy of _Thomisus onustus_, WALCK., a shapely\r\nSpider who weaves no web, lies in wait for her prey and walks sideways,\r\nafter the manner of the Crab.  I have spoken elsewhere {22} of her\r\nencounters with the Domestic Bee, whom she jugulates by biting her in the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nSkilful in the prompt despatch of her prey, the little Crab Spider is no\r\nless well-versed in the nesting art.  I find her settled on a privet in\r\nthe enclosure.  Here, in the heart of a cluster of flowers, the luxurious\r\ncreature plaits a little pocket of white satin, shaped like a wee\r\nthimble.  It is the receptacle for the eggs.  A round, flat lid, of a\r\nfelted fabric, closes the mouth.\r\n\r\nAbove this ceiling rises a dome of stretched threads and faded flowerets\r\nwhich have fallen from the cluster.  This is the watcher's belvedere, her\r\nconning-tower.  An opening, which is always free, gives access to this\r\npost.\r\n\r\nHere the Spider remains on constant duty.  She has thinned greatly since\r\nshe laid her eggs, has almost lost her corporation.  At the least alarm,\r\nshe sallies forth, waves a threatening limb at the passing stranger and\r\ninvites him, with a gesture, to keep his distance.  Having put the\r\nintruder to flight, she quickly returns indoors.\r\n\r\nAnd what does she do in there, under her arch of withered flowers and\r\nsilk?  Night and day, she shields the precious eggs with her poor body\r\nspread out flat.  Eating is neglected.  No more lying in wait, no more\r\nBees drained to the last drop of blood.  Motionless, rapt in meditation,\r\nthe Spider is in an incubating posture, in other words, she is sitting on\r\nher eggs.  Strictly speaking, the word 'incubating' means that and\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nThe brooding Hen is no more assiduous, but she is also a\r\nheating-apparatus and, with the gentle warmth of her body, awakens the\r\ngerms to life.  For the Spider, the heat of the sun suffices; and this\r\nalone keeps me from saying that she 'broods.'\r\n\r\nFor two or three weeks, more and more wrinkled by abstinence, the little\r\nSpider never relaxes her position.  Then comes the hatching.  The\r\nyoungsters stretch a few threads in swing-like curves from twig to twig.\r\nThe tiny rope-dancers practise for some days in the sun; then they\r\ndisperse, each intent upon his own affairs.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the watch-tower of the nest.  The mother is still\r\nthere, but this time lifeless.  The devoted creature has known the\r\ndelight of seeing her family born; she has assisted the weaklings through\r\nthe trap-door; and, when her duty was done, very gently she died.  The\r\nHen does not reach this height of self-abnegation.\r\n\r\nOther Spiders do better still, as, for instance, the Narbonne Lycosa, or\r\nBlack-bellied Tarantula (_Lycosa narbonnensis_, WALCK.), whose prowess\r\nhas been described in an earlier chapter.  The reader will remember her\r\nburrow, her pit of a bottle-neck's width, dug in the pebbly soil beloved\r\nby the lavender and the thyme.  The mouth is rimmed by a bastion of\r\ngravel and bits of wood cemented with silk.  There is nothing else around\r\nher dwelling: no web, no snares of any kind.\r\n\r\nFrom her inch-high turret, the Lycosa lies in wait for the passing\r\nLocust.  She gives a bound, pursues the prey and suddenly deprives it of\r\nmotion with a bite in the neck.  The game is consumed on the spot, or\r\nelse in the lair; the insect's tough hide arouses no disgust.  The sturdy\r\nhuntress is not a drinker of blood, like the Epeira; she needs solid\r\nfood, food that crackles between the jaws.  She is like a Dog devouring\r\nhis bone.\r\n\r\nWould you care to bring her to the light of day from the depths of her\r\nwell?  Insert a thin straw into the burrow and move it about.  Uneasy as\r\nto what is happening above, the recluse hastens to climb up and stops, in\r\na threatening attitude, at some distance from the orifice.  You see her\r\neight eyes gleaming like diamonds in the dark; you see her powerful\r\npoison-fangs yawning, ready to bite.  He who is not accustomed to the\r\nsight of this horror, rising from under the ground, cannot suppress a\r\nshiver.  B-r-r-r-r!  Let us leave the beast alone.\r\n\r\nChance, a poor stand-by, sometimes contrives very well.  At the beginning\r\nof the month of August, the children call me to the far side of the\r\nenclosure, rejoicing in a find which they have made under the rosemary-\r\nbushes.  It is a magnificent Lycosa, with an enormous belly, the sign of\r\nan impending delivery.\r\n\r\nThe obese Spider is gravely devouring something in the midst of a circle\r\nof onlookers.  And what?  The remains of a Lycosa a little smaller than\r\nherself, the remains of her male.  It is the end of the tragedy that\r\nconcludes the nuptials.  The sweetheart is eating her lover.  I allow the\r\nmatrimonial rites to be fulfilled in all their horror; and, when the last\r\nmorsel of the unhappy wretch has been scrunched up, I incarcerate the\r\nterrible matron under a cage standing in an earthen pan filled with sand.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning, ten days later, I find her preparing for her\r\nconfinement.  A silk network is first spun on the ground, covering an\r\nextent about equal to the palm of one's hand.  It is coarse and\r\nshapeless, but firmly fixed.  This is the floor on which the Spider means\r\nto operate.\r\n\r\nOn this foundation, which acts as a protection from the sand, the Lycosa\r\nfashions a round mat, the size of a two-franc piece and made of superb\r\nwhite silk.  With a gentle, uniform movement, which might be regulated by\r\nthe wheels of a delicate piece of clockwork, the tip of the abdomen rises\r\nand falls, each time touching the supporting base a little farther away,\r\nuntil the extreme scope of the mechanism is attained.\r\n\r\nThen, without the Spider's moving her position, the oscillation is\r\nresumed in the opposite direction.  By means of this alternate motion,\r\ninterspersed with numerous contacts, a segment of the sheet is obtained,\r\nof a very accurate texture.  When this is done, the Spider moves a little\r\nalong a circular line and the loom works in the same manner on another\r\nsegment.\r\n\r\nThe silk disk, a sort of hardly concave paten, now no longer receives\r\naught from the spinnerets in its centre; the marginal belt alone\r\nincreases in thickness.  The piece thus becomes a bowl-shaped porringer,\r\nsurrounded by a wide, flat edge.\r\n\r\nThe time for the laying has come.  With one quick emission, the viscous,\r\npale-yellow eggs are laid in the basin, where they heap together in the\r\nshape of a globe which projects largely outside the cavity.  The\r\nspinnerets are once more set going.  With short movements, as the tip of\r\nthe abdomen rises and falls to weave the round mat, they cover up the\r\nexposed hemisphere.  The result is a pill set in the middle of a circular\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\nThe legs, hitherto idle, are now working.  They take up and break off one\r\nby one the threads that keep the round mat stretched on the coarse\r\nsupporting network.  At the same time, the fangs grip this sheet, lift it\r\nby degrees, tear it from its base and fold it over upon the globe of\r\neggs.  It is a laborious operation.  The whole edifice totters, the floor\r\ncollapses, fouled with sand.  By a movement of the legs, those soiled\r\nshreds are cast aside.  Briefly, by means of violent tugs of the fangs,\r\nwhich pull, and broom-like efforts of the legs, which clear away, the\r\nLycosa extricates the bag of eggs and removes it as a clear-cut mass,\r\nfree from any adhesion.\r\n\r\nIt is a white-silk pill, soft to the touch and glutinous.  Its size is\r\nthat of an average cherry.  An observant eye will notice, running\r\nhorizontally around the middle, a fold which a needle is able to raise\r\nwithout breaking it.  This hem, generally undistinguishable from the rest\r\nof the surface, is none other than the edge of the circular mat, drawn\r\nover the lower hemisphere.  The other hemisphere, through which the\r\nyoungsters will go out, is less well fortified: its only wrapper is the\r\ntexture spun over the eggs immediately after they were laid.\r\n\r\nInside, there is nothing but the eggs: no mattress, no soft eiderdown,\r\nlike that of the Epeirae.  The Lycosa, indeed, has no need to guard her\r\neggs against the inclemencies of the winter, for the hatching will take\r\nplace long before the cold weather comes.  Similarly, the Thomisus, with\r\nher early brood, takes good care not to incur useless expenditure: she\r\ngives her eggs, for their protection, a simple purse of satin.\r\n\r\nThe work of spinning, followed by that of tearing, is continued for a\r\nwhole morning, from five to nine o'clock.  Worn out with fatigue, the\r\nmother embraces her dear pill and remains motionless.  I shall see no\r\nmore to-day.  Next morning, I find the Spider carrying the bag of eggs\r\nslung from her stern.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, until the hatching, she does not leave go of the precious\r\nburden, which, fastened to the spinnerets by a short ligament, drags and\r\nbumps along the ground.  With this load banging against her heels, she\r\ngoes about her business; she walks or rests, she seeks her prey, attacks\r\nit and devours it.  Should some accident cause the wallet to drop off, it\r\nis soon replaced.  The spinnerets touch it somewhere, anywhere, and that\r\nis enough: adhesion is at once restored.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa is a stay-at-home.  She never goes out except to snap up some\r\ngame passing within her hunting-domains, near the burrow.  At the end of\r\nAugust, however, it is not unusual to meet her roaming about, dragging\r\nher wallet behind her.  Her hesitations make one think that she is\r\nlooking for her home, which she has left for the moment and has a\r\ndifficulty in finding.\r\n\r\nWhy these rambles?  There are two reasons: first the pairing and then the\r\nmaking of the pill.  There is a lack of space in the burrow, which\r\nprovides only room enough for the Spider engaged in long contemplation.\r\nNow the preparations for the egg-bag require an extensive flooring, a\r\nsupporting framework about the size of one's hand, as my caged prisoner\r\nhas shown us.  The Lycosa has not so much space at her disposal, in her\r\nwell; hence the necessity for coming out and working at her wallet in the\r\nopen air, doubtless in the quiet hours of the night.\r\n\r\nThe meeting with the male seems likewise to demand an excursion.  Running\r\nthe risk of being eaten alive, will he venture to plunge into his lady's\r\ncave, into a lair whence flight would be impossible?  It is very\r\ndoubtful.  Prudence demands that matters should take place outside.  Here\r\nat least there is some chance of beating a hasty retreat which will\r\nenable the rash swain to escape the attacks of his horrible bride.\r\n\r\nThe interview in the open air lessens the danger without removing it\r\nentirely.  We had proof of this when we caught the Lycosa in the act of\r\ndevouring her lover aboveground, in a part of the enclosure which had\r\nbeen broken for planting and which was therefore not suitable for the\r\nSpider's establishment.  The burrow must have been some way off; and the\r\nmeeting of the pair took place at the very spot of the tragic\r\ncatastrophe.  Although he had a clear road, the male was not quick enough\r\nin getting away and was duly eaten.\r\n\r\nAfter this cannibal orgy, does the Lycosa go back home?  Perhaps not, for\r\na while.  Besides, she would have to go out a second time, to manufacture\r\nher pill on a level space of sufficient extent.\r\n\r\nWhen the work is done, some of them emancipate themselves, think they\r\nwill have a look at the country before retiring for good and all.  It is\r\nthese whom we sometimes meet wandering aimlessly and dragging their bag\r\nbehind them.  Sooner or later, however, the vagrants return home; and the\r\nmonth of August is not over before a straw rustled in any burrow will\r\nbring the mother up, with her wallet slung behind her.  I am able to\r\nprocure as many as I want and, with them, to indulge in certain\r\nexperiments of the highest interest.\r\n\r\nIt is a sight worth seeing, that of the Lycosa dragging her treasure\r\nafter her, never leaving it, day or night, sleeping or waking, and\r\ndefending it with a courage that strikes the beholder with awe.  If I try\r\nto take the bag from her, she presses it to her breast in despair, hangs\r\non to my pincers, bites them with her poison-fangs.  I can hear the\r\ndaggers grating on the steel.  No, she would not allow herself to be\r\nrobbed of the wallet with impunity, if my fingers were not supplied with\r\nan implement.\r\n\r\nBy dint of pulling and shaking the pill with the forceps, I take it from\r\nthe Lycosa, who protests furiously.  I fling her in exchange a pill taken\r\nfrom another Lycosa.  It is at once seized in the fangs, embraced by the\r\nlegs and hung on to the spinneret.  Her own or another's: it is all one\r\nto the Spider, who walks away proudly with the alien wallet.  This was to\r\nbe expected, in view of the similarity of the pills exchanged.\r\n\r\nA test of another kind, with a second subject, renders the mistake more\r\nstriking.  I substitute, in the place of the lawful bag which I have\r\nremoved, the work of the Silky Epeira.  The colour and softness of the\r\nmaterial are the same in both cases; but the shape is quite different.\r\nThe stolen object is a globe; the object presented in exchange is an\r\nelliptical conoid studded with angular projections along the edge of the\r\nbase.  The Spider takes no account of this dissimilarity.  She promptly\r\nglues the queer bag to her spinnerets and is as pleased as though she\r\nwere in possession of her real pill.  My experimental villainies have no\r\nother consequences beyond an ephemeral carting.  When hatching-time\r\narrives, early in the case of the Lycosa, late in that of the Epeira, the\r\ngulled Spider abandons the strange bag and pays it no further attention.\r\n\r\nLet us penetrate yet deeper into the wallet-bearer's stupidity.  After\r\ndepriving the Lycosa of her eggs, I throw her a ball of cork, roughly\r\npolished with a file and of the same size as the stolen pill.  She\r\naccepts the corky substance, so different from the silk purse, without\r\nthe least demur.  One would have thought that she would recognize her\r\nmistake with those eight eyes of hers, which gleam like precious stones.\r\nThe silly creature pays no attention.  Lovingly she embraces the cork\r\nball, fondles it with her palpi, fastens it to her spinnerets and\r\nthenceforth drags it after her as though she were dragging her own bag.\r\n\r\nLet us give another the choice between the imitation and the real.  The\r\nrightful pill and the cork ball are placed together on the floor of the\r\njar.  Will the Spider be able to know the one that belongs to her?  The\r\nfool is incapable of doing so.  She makes a wild rush and seizes\r\nhaphazard at one time her property, at another my sham product.  Whatever\r\nis first touched becomes a good capture and is forthwith hung up.\r\n\r\nIf I increase the number of cork balls, if I put in four or five of them,\r\nwith the real pill among them, it is seldom that the Lycosa recovers her\r\nown property.  Attempts at enquiry, attempts at selection there are none.\r\nWhatever she snaps up at random she sticks to, be it good or bad.  As\r\nthere are more of the sham pills of cork, these are the most often seized\r\nby the Spider.\r\n\r\nThis obtuseness baffles me.  Can the animal be deceived by the soft\r\ncontact of the cork?  I replace the cork balls by pellets of cotton or\r\npaper, kept in their round shape with a few bands of thread.  Both are\r\nvery readily accepted instead of the real bag that has been removed.\r\n\r\nCan the illusion be due to the colouring, which is light in the cork and\r\nnot unlike the tint of the silk globe when soiled with a little earth,\r\nwhile it is white in the paper and the cotton, when it is identical with\r\nthat of the original pill?  I give the Lycosa, in exchange for her work,\r\na pellet of silk thread, chosen of a fine red, the brightest of all\r\ncolours.  The uncommon pill is as readily accepted and as jealously\r\nguarded as the others.\r\n\r\nWe will leave the wallet-bearer alone; we know all that we want to know\r\nabout her poverty of intellect.  Let us wait for the hatching, which\r\ntakes place in the first fortnight in September.  As they come out of the\r\npill, the youngsters, to the number of about a couple of hundred, clamber\r\non the Spider's back and there sit motionless, jammed close together,\r\nforming a sort of bark of mingled legs and paunches.  The mother is\r\nunrecognizable under this live mantilla.  When the hatching is over, the\r\nwallet is loosened from the spinnerets and cast aside as a worthless rag.\r\n\r\nThe little ones are very good: none stirs none tries to get more room for\r\nhimself at his neighbours' expense.  What are they doing there, so\r\nquietly?  They allow themselves to be carted about, like the young of the\r\nOpossum.  Whether she sit in long meditation at the bottom of her den, or\r\ncome to the orifice, in mild weather, to bask in the sun, the Lycosa\r\nnever throws off her great-coat of swarming youngsters until the fine\r\nseason comes.\r\n\r\nIf, in the middle of winter, in January or February, I happen, out in the\r\nfields, to ransack the Spider's dwelling, after the rain, snow and frost\r\nhave battered it and, as a rule, dismantled the bastion at the entrance,\r\nI always find her at home, still full of vigour, still carrying her\r\nfamily.  This vehicular upbringing lasts five or six months at least,\r\nwithout interruption.  The celebrated American carrier, the Opossum, who\r\nemancipates her offspring after a few weeks' carting, cuts a poor figure\r\nbeside the Lycosa.\r\n\r\nWhat do the little ones eat, on the maternal spine?  Nothing, so far as I\r\nknow.  I do not see them grow larger.  I find them, at the tardy period\r\nof their emancipation, just as they were when they left the bag.\r\n\r\nDuring the bad season, the mother herself is extremely abstemious.  At\r\nlong intervals, she accepts, in my jars, a belated Locust, whom I have\r\ncaptured, for her benefit, in the sunnier nooks.  In order to keep\r\nherself in condition, as when she is dug up in the course of my winter\r\nexcavations, she must therefore sometimes break her fast and come out in\r\nsearch of prey, without, of course, discarding her live mantilla.\r\n\r\nThe expedition has its dangers.  The youngsters may be brushed off by a\r\nblade of grass.  What becomes of them when they have a fall?  Does the\r\nmother give them a thought?  Does she come to their assistance and help\r\nthem to regain their place on her back?  Not at all.  The affection of a\r\nSpider's heart, divided among some hundreds, can spare but a very feeble\r\nportion to each.  The Lycosa hardly troubles, whether one youngster fall\r\nfrom his place, or six, or all of them.  She waits impassively for the\r\nvictims of the mishap to get out of their own difficulty, which they do,\r\nfor that matter, and very nimbly.\r\n\r\nI sweep the whole family from the back of one of my boarders with a hair-\r\npencil.  Not a sign of emotion, not an attempt at search on the part of\r\nthe denuded one.  After trotting about a little on the sand, the\r\ndislodged youngsters find, these here, those there, one or other of the\r\nmother's legs, spread wide in a circle.  By means of these\r\nclimbing-poles, they swarm to the top and soon the dorsal group resumes\r\nits original form.  Not one of the lot is missing.  The Lycosa's sons\r\nknow their trade as acrobats to perfection: the mother need not trouble\r\nher head about their fall.\r\n\r\nWith a sweep of the pencil, I make the family of one Spider fall around\r\nanother laden with her own family.  The dislodged ones nimbly scramble up\r\nthe legs and climb on the back of their new mother, who kindly allows\r\nthem to behave as though they belonged to her.  There is no room on the\r\nabdomen, the regulation resting-place, which is already occupied by the\r\nreal sons.  The invaders thereupon encamp on the front part, beset the\r\nthorax and change the carrier into a horrible pin-cushion that no longer\r\nbears the least resemblance to a Spider form.  Meanwhile, the sufferer\r\nraises no sort of protest against this access of family.  She placidly\r\naccepts them all and walks them all about.\r\n\r\nThe youngsters, on their side, are unable to distinguish between what is\r\npermitted and forbidden.  Remarkable acrobats that they are, they climb\r\non the first Spider that comes along, even when of a different species,\r\nprovided that she be of a fair size.  I place them in the presence of a\r\nbig Epeira marked with a white cross on a pale-orange ground (_Epeira\r\npallida_, OLIV.).  The little ones, as soon as they are dislodged from\r\nthe back of the Lycosa their mother, clamber up the stranger without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nIntolerant of these familiarities, the Spider shakes the leg encroached\r\nupon and flings the intruders to a distance.  The assault is doggedly\r\nresumed, to such good purpose that a dozen succeed in hoisting themselves\r\nto the top.  The Epeira, who is not accustomed to the tickling of such a\r\nload, turns over on her back and rolls on the ground in the manner of a\r\ndonkey when his hide is itching.  Some are lamed, some are even crushed.\r\nThis does not deter the others, who repeat the escalade as soon as the\r\nEpeira is on her legs again.  Then come more somersaults, more rollings\r\non the back, until the giddy swarm are all discomfited and leave the\r\nSpider in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV: THE NARBONNE LYCOSA: THE BURROW\r\n\r\n\r\nMichelet {23} has told us how, as a printer's apprentice in a cellar, he\r\nestablished amicable relations with a Spider.  At a certain hour of the\r\nday, a ray of sunlight would glint through the window of the gloomy\r\nworkshop and light up the little compositor's case.  Then his\r\neight-legged neighbour would come down from her web and take her share of\r\nthe sunshine on the edge of the case.  The boy did not interfere with\r\nher; he welcomed the trusting visitor as a friend and as a pleasant\r\ndiversion from the long monotony.  When we lack the society of our fellow-\r\nmen, we take refuge in that of animals, without always losing by the\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nI do not, thank God, suffer from the melancholy of a cellar: my solitude\r\nis gay with light and verdure; I attend, whenever I please, the fields'\r\nhigh festival, the Thrushes' concert, the Crickets' symphony; and yet my\r\nfriendly commerce with the Spider is marked by an even greater devotion\r\nthan the young typesetter's.  I admit her to the intimacy of my study, I\r\nmake room for her among my books, I set her in the sun on my\r\nwindow-ledge, I visit her assiduously at her home, in the country.  The\r\nobject of our relations is not to create a means of escape from the petty\r\nworries of life, pin-pricks whereof I have my share like other men, a\r\nvery large share, indeed; I propose to submit to the Spider a host of\r\nquestions whereto, at times, she condescends to reply.\r\n\r\nTo what fair problems does not the habit of frequenting her give rise!  To\r\nset them forth worthily, the marvellous art which the little printer was\r\nto acquire were not too much.  One needs the pen of a Michelet; and I\r\nhave but a rough, blunt pencil.  Let us try, nevertheless: even when\r\npoorly clad, truth is still beautiful.\r\n\r\nI will therefore once more take up the story of the Spider's instinct, a\r\nstory of which the preceding chapters have given but a very rough idea.\r\nSince I wrote those earlier essays, my field of observation has been\r\ngreatly extended.  My notes have been enriched by new and most remarkable\r\nfacts.  It is right that I should employ them for the purpose of a more\r\ndetailed biography.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of order and clearness expose me, it is true, to\r\noccasional repetitions.  This is inevitable when one has to marshal in an\r\nharmonious whole a thousand items culled from day to day, often\r\nunexpectedly, and bearing no relation one to the other.  The observer is\r\nnot master of his time; opportunity leads him and by unsuspected ways.  A\r\ncertain question suggested by an earlier fact finds no reply until many\r\nyears after.  Its scope, moreover, is amplified and completed with views\r\ncollected on the road.  In a work, therefore, of this fragmentary\r\ncharacter, repetitions, necessary for the due co-ordination of ideas, are\r\ninevitable.  I shall be as sparing of them as I can.\r\n\r\nLet us once more introduce our old friends the Epeira and the Lycosa, who\r\nare the most important Spiders in my district.  The Narbonne Lycosa, or\r\nBlack-bellied Tarantula, chooses her domicile in the waste, pebbly lands\r\nbeloved of the thyme.  Her dwelling, a fortress rather than a villa, is a\r\nburrow about nine inches deep and as wide as the neck of a claret-bottle.\r\nThe direction is perpendicular, in so far as obstacles, frequent in a\r\nsoil of this kind, permit.  A bit of gravel can be extracted and hoisted\r\noutside; but a flint is an immovable boulder which the Spider avoids by\r\ngiving a bend to her gallery.  If more such are met with, the residence\r\nbecomes a winding cave, with stone vaults, with lobbies communicating by\r\nmeans of sharp passages.\r\n\r\nThis lack of plan has no attendant drawbacks, so well does the owner,\r\nfrom long habit, know every corner and storey of her mansion.  If any\r\ninteresting buzz occur overhead, the Lycosa climbs up from her rugged\r\nmanor with the same speed as from a vertical shaft.  Perhaps she even\r\nfinds the windings and turnings an advantage, when she has to drag into\r\nher den a prey that happens to defend itself.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the end of the burrow widens into a side-chamber, a lounge or\r\nresting-place where the Spider meditates at length and is content to lead\r\na life of quiet when her belly is full.\r\n\r\nA silk coating, but a scanty one, for the Lycosa has not the wealth of\r\nsilk possessed by the Weaving Spiders, lines the walls of the tube and\r\nkeeps the loose earth from falling.  This plaster, which cements the\r\nincohesive and smooths the rugged parts, is reserved more particularly\r\nfor the top of the gallery, near the mouth.  Here, in the daytime, if\r\nthings be peaceful all around, the Lycosa stations herself, either to\r\nenjoy the warmth of the sun, her great delight, or to lie in wait for\r\ngame.  The threads of the silk lining afford a firm hold to the claws on\r\nevery side, whether the object be to sit motionless for hours, revelling\r\nin the light and heat, or to pounce upon the passing prey.\r\n\r\nAround the orifice of the burrow rises, to a greater or lesser height, a\r\ncircular parapet, formed of tiny pebbles, twigs and straps borrowed from\r\nthe dry leaves of the neighbouring grasses, all more or less dexterously\r\ntied together and cemented with silk.  This work of rustic architecture\r\nis never missing, even though it be no more than a mere pad.\r\n\r\nWhen she reaches maturity and is once settled, the Lycosa becomes\r\neminently domesticated.  I have been living in close communion with her\r\nfor the last three years.  I have installed her in large earthen pans on\r\nthe window-sills of my study and I have her daily under my eyes.  Well,\r\nit is very rarely that I happen on her outside, a few inches from her\r\nhole, back to which she bolts at the least alarm.\r\n\r\nWe may take it, then, that, when not in captivity, the Lycosa does not go\r\nfar afield to gather the wherewithal to build her parapet and that she\r\nmakes shift with what she finds upon her threshold.  In these conditions,\r\nthe building-stones are soon exhausted and the masonry ceases for lack of\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe wish came over me to see what dimensions the circular edifice would\r\nassume, if the Spider were given an unlimited supply.  With captives to\r\nwhom I myself act as purveyor the thing is easy enough.  Were it only\r\nwith a view to helping whoso may one day care to continue these relations\r\nwith the big Spider of the waste-lands, let me describe how my subjects\r\nare housed.\r\n\r\nA good-sized earthenware pan, some nine inches deep, is filled with a\r\nred, clayey earth, rich in pebbles, similar, in short, to that of the\r\nplaces haunted by the Lycosa.  Properly moistened into a paste, the\r\nartificial soil is heaped, layer by layer, around a central reed, of a\r\nbore equal to that of the animal's natural burrow.  When the receptacle\r\nis filled to the top, I withdraw the reed, which leaves a yawning,\r\nperpendicular shaft.  I thus obtain the abode which shall replace that of\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nTo find the hermit to inhabit it is merely the matter of a walk in the\r\nneighbourhood.  When removed from her own dwelling, which is turned topsy-\r\nturvy by my trowel, and placed in possession of the den produced by my\r\nart, the Lycosa at once disappears into that den.  She does not come out\r\nagain, seeks nothing better elsewhere.  A large wire-gauze cover rests on\r\nthe soil in the pan and prevents escape.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the watch, in this respect, makes no demands upon my\r\ndiligence.  The prisoner is satisfied with her new abode and manifests no\r\nregret for her natural burrow.  There is no attempt at flight on her\r\npart.  Let me not omit to add that each pan must receive not more than\r\none inhabitant.  The Lycosa is very intolerant.  To her, a neighbour is\r\nfair game, to be eaten without scruple when one has might on one's side.\r\nTime was when, unaware of this fierce intolerance, which is more savage\r\nstill at breeding-time, I saw hideous orgies perpetrated in my\r\noverstocked cages.  I shall have occasion to describe those tragedies\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nLet us meanwhile consider the isolated Lycosae.  They do not touch up the\r\ndwelling which I have moulded for them with a bit of reed; at most, now\r\nand again, perhaps with the object of forming a lounge or bedroom at the\r\nbottom, they fling out a few loads of rubbish.  But all, little by\r\nlittle, build the kerb that is to edge the mouth.\r\n\r\nI have given them plenty of first-rate materials, far superior to those\r\nwhich they use when left to their own resources.  These consist, first,\r\nfor the foundations, of little smooth stones, some of which are as large\r\nas an almond.  With this road-metal are mingled short strips of raphia,\r\nor palm-fibre, flexible ribbons, easily bent.  These stand for the\r\nSpider's usual basket-work, consisting of slender stalks and dry blades\r\nof grass.  Lastly, by way of an unprecedented treasure, never yet\r\nemployed by a Lycosa, I place at my captives' disposal some thick threads\r\nof wool, cut into inch lengths.\r\n\r\nAs I wish, at the same time, to find out whether my animals, with the\r\nmagnificent lenses of their eyes, are able to distinguish colours and\r\nprefer one colour to another, I mix up bits of wool of different hues:\r\nthere are red, green, white and yellow pieces.  If the Spider have any\r\npreference, she can choose where she pleases.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa always works at night, a regrettable circumstance, which does\r\nnot allow me to follow the worker's methods.  I see the result; and that\r\nis all.  Were I to visit the building-yard by the light of a lantern, I\r\nshould be no wiser.  The animal, which is very shy, would at once dive\r\ninto her lair; and I should have lost my sleep for nothing.  Furthermore,\r\nshe is not a very diligent labourer; she likes to take her time.  Two or\r\nthree bits of wool or raphia placed in position represent a whole night's\r\nwork.  And to this slowness we must add long spells of utter idleness.\r\n\r\nTwo months pass; and the result of my liberality surpasses my\r\nexpectations.  Possessing more windfalls than they know what to do with,\r\nall picked up in their immediate neighbourhood, my Lycosae have built\r\nthemselves donjon-keeps the like of which their race has not yet known.\r\nAround the orifice, on a slightly sloping bank, small, flat, smooth\r\nstones have been laid to form a broken, flagged pavement.  The larger\r\nstones, which are Cyclopean blocks compared with the size of the animal\r\nthat has shifted them, are employed as abundantly as the others.\r\n\r\nOn this rockwork stands the donjon.  It is an interlacing of raphia and\r\nbits of wool, picked up at random, without distinction of shade.  Red and\r\nwhite, green and yellow are mixed without any attempt at order.  The\r\nLycosa is indifferent to the joys of colour.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate result is a sort of muff, a couple of inches high.  Bands of\r\nsilk, supplied by the spinnerets, unite the pieces, so that the whole\r\nresembles a coarse fabric.  Without being absolutely faultless, for there\r\nare always awkward pieces on the outside, which the worker could not\r\nhandle, the gaudy building is not devoid of merit.  The bird lining its\r\nnest would do no better.  Whoso sees the curious, many-coloured\r\nproductions in my pans takes them for an outcome of my industry,\r\ncontrived with a view to some experimental mischief; and his surprise is\r\ngreat when I confess who the real author is.  No one would ever believe\r\nthe Spider capable of constructing such a monument.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that, in a state of liberty, on our barren waste-\r\nlands, the Lycosa does not indulge in such sumptuous architecture.  I\r\nhave given the reason: she is too great a stay-at-home to go in search of\r\nmaterials and she makes use of the limited resources which she finds\r\naround her.  Bits of earth, small chips of stone, a few twigs, a few\r\nwithered grasses: that is all, or nearly all.  Wherefore the work is\r\ngenerally quite modest and reduced to a parapet that hardly attracts\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nMy captives teach us that, when materials are plentiful, especially\r\ntextile materials that remove all fears of landslip, the Lycosa delights\r\nin tall turrets.  She understands the art of donjon-building and puts it\r\ninto practice as often as she possesses the means.\r\n\r\nThis art is akin to another, from which it is apparently derived.  If the\r\nsun be fierce or if rain threaten, the Lycosa closes the entrance to her\r\ndwelling with a silken trellis-work, wherein she embeds different\r\nmatters, often the remnants of victims which she has devoured.  The\r\nancient Gael nailed the heads of his vanquished enemies to the door of\r\nhis hut.  In the same way, the fierce Spider sticks the skulls of her\r\nprey into the lid of her cave.  These lumps look very well on the ogre's\r\nroof; but we must be careful not to mistake them for warlike trophies.\r\nThe animal knows nothing of our barbarous bravado.  Everything at the\r\nthreshold of the burrow is used indiscriminately: fragments of Locust,\r\nvegetable remains and especially particles of earth.  A Dragon-fly's head\r\nbaked by the sun is as good as a bit of gravel and no better.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with silk and all sorts of tiny materials, the Lycosa builds a\r\nlidded cap to the entrance of her home.  I am not well acquainted with\r\nthe reasons that prompt her to barricade herself indoors, particularly as\r\nthe seclusion is only temporary and varies greatly in duration.  I obtain\r\nprecise details from a tribe of Lycosae wherewith the enclosure, as will\r\nbe seen later, happens to be thronged in consequence of my investigations\r\ninto the dispersal of the family.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the tropical August heat, I see my Lycosae, now this\r\nbatch, now that, building, at the entrance to the burrow, a convex\r\nceiling, which is difficult to distinguish from the surrounding soil.  Can\r\nit be to protect themselves from the too-vivid light?  This is doubtful;\r\nfor, a few days later, though the power of the sun remain the same, the\r\nroof is broken open and the Spider reappears at her door, where she\r\nrevels in the torrid heat of the dog-days.\r\n\r\nLater, when October comes, if it be rainy weather, she retires once more\r\nunder a roof, as though she were guarding herself against the damp.  Let\r\nus not be too positive of anything, however: often, when it is raining\r\nhard, the Spider bursts her ceiling and leaves her house open to the\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the lid is only put on for serious domestic events, notably for\r\nthe laying.  I do, in fact, perceive young Lycosae who shut themselves in\r\nbefore they have attained the dignity of motherhood and who reappear,\r\nsome time later, with the bag containing the eggs hung to their stern.\r\nThe inference that they close the door with the object of securing\r\ngreater quiet while spinning the maternal cocoon would not be in keeping\r\nwith the unconcern displayed by the majority.  I find some who lay their\r\neggs in an open burrow; I come upon some who weave their cocoon and cram\r\nit with eggs in the open air, before they even own a residence.  In\r\nshort, I do not succeed in fathoming the reasons that cause the burrow to\r\nbe closed, no matter what the weather, hot or cold, wet or dry.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that the lid is broken and repaired repeatedly,\r\nsometimes on the same day.  In spite of the earthy casing, the silk woof\r\ngives it the requisite pliancy to cleave when pushed by the anchorite and\r\nto rip open without falling into ruins.  Swept back to the circumference\r\nof the mouth and increased by the wreckage of further ceilings, it\r\nbecomes a parapet, which the Lycosa raises by degrees in her long moments\r\nof leisure.  The bastion which surmounts the burrow, therefore, takes its\r\norigin from the temporary lid.  The turret derives from the split\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this turret?  My pans will tell us that.  An\r\nenthusiastic votary of the chase, so long as she is not permanently\r\nfixed, the Lycosa, once she has set up house, prefers to lie in ambush\r\nand wait for the quarry.  Every day, when the heat is greatest, I see my\r\ncaptives come up slowly from under ground and lean upon the battlements\r\nof their woolly castle-keep.  They are then really magnificent in their\r\nstately gravity.  With their swelling belly contained within the\r\naperture, their head outside, their glassy eyes staring, their legs\r\ngathered for a spring, for hours and hours they wait, motionless, bathing\r\nvoluptuously in the sun.\r\n\r\nShould a tit-bit to her liking happen to pass, forthwith the watcher\r\ndarts from her tall tower, swift as an arrow from the bow.  With a dagger-\r\nthrust in the neck, she stabs the jugular of the Locust, Dragon-fly or\r\nother prey whereof I am the purveyor; and she as quickly scales the\r\ndonjon and retires with her capture.  The performance is a wonderful\r\nexhibition of skill and speed.\r\n\r\nVery seldom is a quarry missed, provided that it pass at a convenient\r\ndistance, within the range of the huntress' bound.  But, if the prey be\r\nat some distance, for instance on the wire of the cage, the Lycosa takes\r\nno notice of it.  Scorning to go in pursuit, she allows it to roam at\r\nwill.  She never strikes except when sure of her stroke.  She achieves\r\nthis by means of her tower.  Hiding behind the wall, she sees the\r\nstranger advancing, keeps her eyes on him and suddenly pounces when he\r\ncomes within reach.  These abrupt tactics make the thing a certainty.\r\nThough he were winged and swift of flight, the unwary one who approaches\r\nthe ambush is lost.\r\n\r\nThis presumes, it is true, an exemplary patience on the Lycosa's part;\r\nfor the burrow has naught that can serve to entice victims.  At best, the\r\nledge provided by the turret may, at rare intervals, tempt some weary\r\nwayfarer to use it as a resting-place.  But, if the quarry do not come to-\r\nday, it is sure to come to-morrow, the next day, or later, for the\r\nLocusts hop innumerable in the waste-land, nor are they always able to\r\nregulate their leaps.  Some day or other, chance is bound to bring one of\r\nthem within the purlieus of the burrow.  This is the moment to spring\r\nupon the pilgrim from the ramparts.  Until then, we maintain a stoical\r\nvigilance.  We shall dine when we can; but we shall end by dining.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa, therefore, well aware of these lingering eventualities, waits\r\nand is not unduly distressed by a prolonged abstinence.  She has an\r\naccommodating stomach, which is satisfied to be gorged to-day and to\r\nremain empty afterwards for goodness knows how long.  I have sometimes\r\nneglected my catering-duties for weeks at a time; and my boarders have\r\nbeen none the worse for it.  After a more or less protracted fast, they\r\ndo not pine away, but are smitten with a wolf-like hunger.  All these\r\nravenous eaters are alike: they guzzle to excess to-day, in anticipation\r\nof to-morrow's dearth.\r\n\r\nIn her youth, before she has a burrow, the Lycosa earns her living in\r\nanother manner.  Clad in grey like her elders, but without the\r\nblack-velvet apron which she receives on attaining the marriageable age,\r\nshe roams among the scrubby grass.  This is true hunting.  Should a\r\nsuitable quarry heave in sight, the Spider pursues it, drives it from its\r\nshelters, follows it hot-foot.  The fugitive gains the heights, makes as\r\nthough to fly away.  He has not the time.  With an upward leap, the\r\nLycosa grabs him before he can rise.\r\n\r\nI am charmed with the agility wherewith my yearling boarders seize the\r\nFlies which I provide for them.  In vain does the Fly take refuge a\r\ncouple of inches up, on some blade of grass.  With a sudden spring into\r\nthe air, the Spider pounces on the prey.  No Cat is quicker in catching\r\nher Mouse.\r\n\r\nBut these are the feats of youth not handicapped by obesity.  Later, when\r\na heavy paunch, dilated with eggs and silk, has to be trailed along,\r\nthose gymnastic performances become impracticable.  The Lycosa then digs\r\nherself a settled abode, a hunting-box, and sits in her watch-tower, on\r\nthe look-out for game.\r\n\r\nWhen and how is the burrow obtained wherein the Lycosa, once a vagrant,\r\nnow a stay-at-home, is to spend the remainder of her long life?  We are\r\nin autumn, the weather is already turning cool.  This is how the Field\r\nCricket sets to work: as long as the days are fine and the nights not too\r\ncold, the future chorister of spring rambles over the fallows, careless\r\nof a local habitation.  At critical moments, the cover of a dead leaf\r\nprovides him with a temporary shelter.  In the end, the burrow, the\r\npermanent dwelling, is dug as the inclement season draws nigh.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa shares the Cricket's views: like him, she finds a thousand\r\npleasures in the vagabond life.  With September comes the nuptial badge,\r\nthe black-velvet bib.  The Spiders meet at night, by the soft moonlight:\r\nthey romp together, they eat the beloved shortly after the wedding; by\r\nday, they scour the country, they track the game on the short-pile,\r\ngrassy carpet, they take their fill of the joys of the sun.  That is much\r\nbetter than solitary meditation at the bottom of a well.  And so it is\r\nnot rare to see young mothers dragging their bag of eggs, or even already\r\ncarrying their family, and as yet without a home.\r\n\r\nIn October, it is time to settle down.  We then, in fact, find two sorts\r\nof burrows, which differ in diameter.  The larger, bottle-neck burrows\r\nbelong to the old matrons, who have owned their house for two years at\r\nleast.  The smaller, of the width of a thick lead-pencil, contain the\r\nyoung mothers, born that year.  By dint of long and leisurely\r\nalterations, the novice's earths will increase in depth as well as in\r\ndiameter and become roomy abodes, similar to those of the grandmothers.\r\nIn both, we find the owner and her family, the latter sometimes already\r\nhatched and sometimes still enclosed in the satin wallet.\r\n\r\nSeeing no digging-tools, such as the excavation of the dwelling seemed to\r\nme to require, I wondered whether the Lycosa might not avail herself of\r\nsome chance gallery, the work of the Cicada or the Earth-worm.  This\r\nready-made tunnel, thought I, must shorten the labours of the Spider, who\r\nappears to be so badly off for tools; she would only have to enlarge it\r\nand put it in order.  I was wrong: the burrow is excavated, from start to\r\nfinish, by her unaided labour.\r\n\r\nThen where are the digging-implements?  We think of the legs, of the\r\nclaws.  We think of them, but reflection tells us that tools such as\r\nthese would not do: they are too long and too difficult to wield in a\r\nconfined space.  What is required is the miner's short-handled pick,\r\nwherewith to drive hard, to insert, to lever and to extract; what is\r\nrequired is the sharp point that enters the earth and crumbles it into\r\nfragments.  There remain the Lycosa's fangs, delicate weapons which we at\r\nfirst hesitate to associate with such work, so illogical does it seem to\r\ndig a pit with surgeon's scalpels.\r\n\r\nThe fangs are a pair of sharp, curved points, which, when at rest, crook\r\nlike a finger and take shelter between two strong pillars.  The Cat\r\nsheathes her claws under the velvet of the paw, to preserve their edge\r\nand sharpness.  In the same way, the Lycosa protects her poisoned daggers\r\nby folding them within the case of two powerful columns, which come plumb\r\non the surface and contain the muscles that work them.\r\n\r\nWell, this surgical outfit, intended for stabbing the jugular artery of\r\nthe prey, suddenly becomes a pick-axe and does rough navvy's work.  To\r\nwitness the underground digging is impossible; but we can, at least, with\r\nthe exercise of a little patience, see the rubbish carted away.  If I\r\nwatch my captives, without tiring, at a very early hour--for the work\r\ntakes place mostly at night and at long intervals--in the end I catch\r\nthem coming up with a load.  Contrary to what I expected, the legs take\r\nno part in the carting.  It is the mouth that acts as the barrow.  A tiny\r\nball of earth is held between the fangs and is supported by the palpi, or\r\nfeelers, which are little arms employed in the service of the\r\nmouth-parts.  The Lycosa descends cautiously from her turret, goes to\r\nsome distance to get rid of her burden and quickly dives down again to\r\nbring up more.\r\n\r\nWe have seen enough: we know that the Lycosa's fangs, those lethal\r\nweapons, are not afraid to bite into clay and gravel.  They knead the\r\nexcavated rubbish into pellets, take up the mass of earth and carry it\r\noutside.  The rest follows naturally; it is the fangs that dig, delve and\r\nextract.  How finely-tempered they must be, not to be blunted by this\r\nwell-sinker's work and to do duty presently in the surgical operation of\r\nstabbing the neck!\r\n\r\nI have said that the repairs and extensions of the burrow are made at\r\nlong intervals.  From time to time, the circular parapet receives\r\nadditions and becomes a little higher; less frequently still, the\r\ndwelling is enlarged and deepened.  As a rule, the mansion remains as it\r\nwas for a whole season.  Towards the end of winter, in March more than at\r\nany other period, the Lycosa seems to wish to give herself a little more\r\nspace.  This is the moment to subject her to certain tests.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Field Cricket, when removed from his burrow and caged\r\nunder conditions that would allow him to dig himself a new home should\r\nthe fit seize him, prefers to tramp from one casual shelter to another,\r\nor rather abandons every idea of creating a permanent residence.  There\r\nis a short season whereat the instinct for building a subterranean\r\ngallery is imperatively aroused.  When this season is past, the\r\nexcavating artist, if accidentally deprived of his abode, becomes a\r\nwandering Bohemian, careless of a lodging.  He has forgotten his talents\r\nand he sleeps out.\r\n\r\nThat the bird, the nest-builder, should neglect its art when it has no\r\nbrood to care for is perfectly logical: it builds for its family, not for\r\nitself.  But what shall we say of the Cricket, who is exposed to a\r\nthousand mishaps when away from home?  The protection of a roof would be\r\nof great use to him; and the giddy-pate does not give it a thought,\r\nthough he is very strong and more capable than ever of digging with his\r\npowerful jaws.\r\n\r\nWhat reason can we allege for this neglect?  None, unless it be that the\r\nseason of strenuous burrowing is past.  The instincts have a calendar of\r\ntheir own.  At the given hour, suddenly they awaken; as suddenly,\r\nafterwards, they fall asleep.  The ingenious become incompetent when the\r\nprescribed period is ended.\r\n\r\nOn a subject of this kind, we can consult the Spider of the waste-lands.\r\nI catch an old Lycosa in the fields and house her, that same day, under\r\nwire, in a burrow where I have prepared a soil to her liking.  If, by my\r\ncontrivances and with a bit of reed, I have previously moulded a burrow\r\nroughly representing the one from which I took her, the Spider enters it\r\nforthwith and seems pleased with her new residence.  The product of my\r\nart is accepted as her lawful property and undergoes hardly any\r\nalterations.  In course of time, a bastion is erected around the orifice;\r\nthe top of the gallery is cemented with silk; and that is all.  In this\r\nestablishment of my building, the animal's behaviour remains what it\r\nwould be under natural conditions.\r\n\r\nBut place the Lycosa on the surface of the ground, without first shaping\r\na burrow.  What will the homeless Spider do?  Dig herself a dwelling, one\r\nwould think.  She has the strength to do so; she is in the prime of life.\r\nBesides, the soil is similar to that whence I ousted her and suits the\r\noperation perfectly.  We therefore expect to see the Spider settled\r\nbefore long in a shaft of her own construction.\r\n\r\nWe are disappointed.  Weeks pass and not an effort is made, not one.\r\nDemoralized by the absence of an ambush, the Lycosa hardly vouchsafes a\r\nglance at the game which I serve up.  The Crickets pass within her reach\r\nin vain; most often she scorns them.  She slowly wastes away with fasting\r\nand boredom.  At length, she dies.\r\n\r\nTake up your miner's trade again, poor fool!  Make yourself a home, since\r\nyou know how to, and life will be sweet to you for many a long day yet:\r\nthe weather is fine and victuals plentiful.  Dig, delve, go underground,\r\nwhere safety lies.  Like an idiot, you refrain; and you perish.  Why?\r\n\r\nBecause the craft which you were wont to ply is forgotten; because the\r\ndays of patient digging are past and your poor brain is unable to work\r\nback.  To do a second time what has been done already is beyond your wit.\r\nFor all your meditative air, you cannot solve the problem of how to\r\nreconstruct that which is vanished and gone.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what we can do with younger Lycosae, who are at the\r\nburrowing-stage.  I dig out five or six at the end of February.  They are\r\nhalf the size of the old ones; their burrows are equal in diameter to my\r\nlittle finger.  Rubbish quite fresh-spread around the pit bears witness\r\nto the recent date of the excavations.\r\n\r\nRelegated to their wire cages, these young Lycosae behave differently\r\naccording as the soil placed at their disposal is or is not already\r\nprovided with a burrow made by me.  A burrow is hardly the word: I give\r\nthem but the nucleus of a shaft, about an inch deep, to lure them on.\r\nWhen in possession of this rudimentary lair, the Spider does not hesitate\r\nto pursue the work which I have interrupted in the fields.  At night, she\r\ndigs with a will.  I can see this by the heap of rubbish flung aside.  She\r\nat last obtains a house to suit her, a house surmounted by the usual\r\nturret.\r\n\r\nThe others, on the contrary, those Spiders for whom the thrust of my\r\npencil has not contrived an entrance-hall representing, to a certain\r\nextent, the natural gallery whence I dislodged them, absolutely refuse to\r\nwork; and they die, notwithstanding the abundance of provisions.\r\n\r\nThe first pursue the season's task.  They were digging when I caught\r\nthem; and, carried away by the enthusiasm of their activity, they go on\r\ndigging inside my cages.  Taken in by my decoy-shaft, they deepen the\r\nimprint of the pencil as though they were deepening their real vestibule.\r\nThey do not begin their labours over again; they continue them.\r\n\r\nThe second, not having this inducement, this semblance of a burrow\r\nmistaken for their own work, forsake the idea of digging and allow\r\nthemselves to die, because they would have to travel back along the chain\r\nof actions and to resume the pick-strokes of the start.  To begin all\r\nover again requires reflection, a quality wherewith they are not endowed.\r\n\r\nTo the insect--and we have seen this in many earlier cases--what is done\r\nis done and cannot be taken up again.  The hands of a watch do not move\r\nbackwards.  The insect behaves in much the same way.  Its activity urges\r\nit in one direction, ever forwards, without allowing it to retrace its\r\nsteps, even when an accident makes this necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat the Mason-bees and the others taught us erewhile the Lycosa now\r\nconfirms in her manner.  Incapable of taking fresh pains to build herself\r\na second dwelling, when the first is done for, she will go on the tramp,\r\nshe will break into a neighbour's house, she will run the risk of being\r\neaten should she not prove the stronger, but she will never think of\r\nmaking herself a home by starting afresh.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange intellect is that of the animal, a mixture of mechanical\r\nroutine and subtle brain-power!  Does it contain gleams that contrive,\r\nwishes that pursue a definite object?  Following in the wake of so many\r\nothers, the Lycosa warrants us in entertaining a doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V: THE NARBONNE LYCOSA: THE FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor three weeks and more, the Lycosa trails the bag of eggs hanging to\r\nher spinnerets.  The reader will remember the experiments described in\r\nthe third chapter of this volume, particularly those with the cork ball\r\nand the thread pellet which the Spider so foolishly accepts in exchange\r\nfor the real pill.  Well, this exceedingly dull-witted mother, satisfied\r\nwith aught that knocks against her heels, is about to make us wonder at\r\nher devotion.\r\n\r\nWhether she come up from her shaft to lean upon the kerb and bask in the\r\nsun, whether she suddenly retire underground in the face of danger, or\r\nwhether she be roaming the country before settling down, never does she\r\nlet go her precious bag, that very cumbrous burden in walking, climbing\r\nor leaping.  If, by some accident, it become detached from the fastening\r\nto which it is hung, she flings herself madly on her treasure and\r\nlovingly embraces it, ready to bite whoso would take it from her.  I\r\nmyself am sometimes the thief.  I then hear the points of the\r\npoison-fangs grinding against the steel of my pincers, which tug in one\r\ndirection while the Lycosa tugs in the other.  But let us leave the\r\nanimal alone: with a quick touch of the spinnerets, the pill is restored\r\nto its place; and the Spider strides off, still menacing.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of summer, all the householders, old or young, whether in\r\ncaptivity on the window-sill or at liberty in the paths of the enclosure,\r\nsupply me daily with the following improving sight.  In the morning, as\r\nsoon as the sun is hot and beats upon their burrow, the anchorites come\r\nup from the bottom with their bag and station themselves at the opening.\r\nLong siestas on the threshold in the sun are the order of the day\r\nthroughout the fine season; but, at the present time, the position\r\nadopted is a different one.  Formerly, the Lycosa came out into the sun\r\nfor her own sake.  Leaning on the parapet, she had the front half of her\r\nbody outside the pit and the hinder half inside.\r\n\r\nThe eyes took their fill of light; the belly remained in the dark.  When\r\ncarrying her egg-bag, the Spider reverses the posture: the front is in\r\nthe pit, the rear outside.  With her hind-legs she holds the white pill\r\nbulging with germs lifted above the entrance; gently she turns and\r\nreturns it, so as to present every side to the life-giving rays.  And\r\nthis goes on for half the day, so long as the temperature is high; and it\r\nis repeated daily, with exquisite patience, during three or four weeks.\r\nTo hatch its eggs, the bird covers them with the quilt of its breast; it\r\nstrains them to the furnace of its heart.  The Lycosa turns hers in front\r\nof the hearth of hearths, she gives them the sun as an incubator.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of September, the young ones, who have been some time\r\nhatched, are ready to come out.  The pill rips open along the middle\r\nfold.  We read of the origin of this fold in an earlier chapter. {24}\r\nDoes the mother, feeling the brood quicken inside the satin wrapper,\r\nherself break open the vessel at the opportune moment?  It seems\r\nprobable.  On the other hand, there may be a spontaneous bursting, such\r\nas we shall see later in the Banded Epeira's balloon, a tough wallet\r\nwhich opens a breach of its own accord, long after the mother has ceased\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nThe whole family emerges from the bag straightway.  Then and there, the\r\nyoungsters climb to the mother's back.  As for the empty bag, now a\r\nworthless shred, it is flung out of the burrow; the Lycosa does not give\r\nit a further thought.  Huddled together, sometimes in two or three\r\nlayers, according to their number, the little ones cover the whole back\r\nof the mother, who, for seven or eight months to come, will carry her\r\nfamily night and day.  Nowhere can we hope to see a more edifying\r\ndomestic picture than that of the Lycosa clothed in her young.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, I meet a little band of gipsies passing along the high-\r\nroad on their way to some neighbouring fair.  The new-born babe mewls on\r\nthe mother's breast, in a hammock formed out of a kerchief.  The last-\r\nweaned is carried pick-a-back; a third toddles clinging to its mother's\r\nskirts; others follow closely, the biggest in the rear, ferreting in the\r\nblackberry-laden hedgerows.  It is a magnificent spectacle of happy-go-\r\nlucky fruitfulness.  They go their way, penniless and rejoicing.  The sun\r\nis hot and the earth is fertile.\r\n\r\nBut how this picture pales before that of the Lycosa, that incomparable\r\ngipsy whose brats are numbered by the hundred!  And one and all of them,\r\nfrom September to April, without a moment's respite, find room upon the\r\npatient creature's back, where they are content to lead a tranquil life\r\nand to be carted about.\r\n\r\nThe little ones are very good; none moves, none seeks a quarrel with his\r\nneighbours.  Clinging together, they form a continuous drapery, a shaggy\r\nulster under which the mother becomes unrecognizable.  Is it an animal, a\r\nfluff of wool, a cluster of small seeds fastened to one another?  'Tis\r\nimpossible to tell at the first glance.\r\n\r\nThe equilibrium of this living blanket is not so firm but that falls\r\noften occur, especially when the mother climbs from indoors and comes to\r\nthe threshold to let the little ones take the sun.  The least brush\r\nagainst the gallery unseats a part of the family.  The mishap is not\r\nserious.  The Hen, fidgeting about her Chicks, looks for the strays,\r\ncalls them, gathers them together.  The Lycosa knows not these maternal\r\nalarms.  Impassively, she leaves those who drop off to manage their own\r\ndifficulty, which they do with wonderful quickness.  Commend me to those\r\nyoungsters for getting up without whining, dusting themselves and\r\nresuming their seat in the saddle!  The unhorsed ones promptly find a leg\r\nof the mother, the usual climbing-pole; they swarm up it as fast as they\r\ncan and recover their places on the bearer's back.  The living bark of\r\nanimals is reconstructed in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nTo speak here of mother-love were, I think, extravagant.  The Lycosa's\r\naffection for her offspring hardly surpasses that of the plant, which is\r\nunacquainted with any tender feeling and nevertheless bestows the nicest\r\nand most delicate care upon its seeds.  The animal, in many cases, knows\r\nno other sense of motherhood.  What cares the Lycosa for her brood!  She\r\naccepts another's as readily as her own; she is satisfied so long as her\r\nback is burdened with a swarming crowd, whether it issue from her ovaries\r\nor elsewhence.  There is no question here of real maternal affection.\r\n\r\nI have described elsewhere the prowess of the Copris {25} watching over\r\ncells that are not her handiwork and do not contain her offspring.  With\r\na zeal which even the additional labour laid upon her does not easily\r\nweary, she removes the mildew from the alien dung-balls, which far exceed\r\nthe regular nests in number; she gently scrapes and polishes and repairs\r\nthem; she listens to them attentively and enquires by ear into each\r\nnursling's progress.  Her real collection could not receive greater care.\r\nHer own family or another's: it is all one to her.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa is equally indifferent.  I take a hair-pencil and sweep the\r\nliving burden from one of my Spiders, making it fall close to another\r\ncovered with her little ones.  The evicted youngsters scamper about, find\r\nthe new mother's legs outspread, nimbly clamber up these and mount on the\r\nback of the obliging creature, who quietly lets them have their way.\r\n\r\nThey slip in among the others, or, when the layer is too thick, push to\r\nthe front and pass from the abdomen to the thorax and even to the head,\r\nthough leaving the region of the eyes uncovered.  It does not do to blind\r\nthe bearer: the common safety demands that.  They know this and respect\r\nthe lenses of the eyes, however populous the assembly be.  The whole\r\nanimal is now covered with a swarming carpet of young, all except the\r\nlegs, which must preserve their freedom of action, and the under part of\r\nthe body, where contact with the ground is to be feared.\r\n\r\nMy pencil forces a third family upon the already overburdened Spider; and\r\nthis too is peacefully accepted.  The youngsters huddle up closer, lie\r\none on top of the other in layers and room is found for all.  The Lycosa\r\nhas lost the last semblance of an animal, has become a nameless bristling\r\nthing that walks about.  Falls are frequent and are followed by continual\r\nclimbings.\r\n\r\nI perceive that I have reached the limits not of the bearer's good-will,\r\nbut of equilibrium.  The Spider would adopt an indefinite further number\r\nof foundlings, if the dimensions of her back afforded them a firm hold.\r\nLet us be content with this.  Let us restore each family to its mother,\r\ndrawing at random from the lot.  There must necessarily be interchanges,\r\nbut that is of no importance: real children and adopted children are the\r\nsame thing in the Lycosa's eyes.\r\n\r\nOne would like to know if, apart from my artifices, in circumstances\r\nwhere I do not interfere, the good-natured dry-nurse sometimes burdens\r\nherself with a supplementary family; it would also be interesting to\r\nlearn what comes of this association of lawful offspring and strangers.  I\r\nhave ample materials wherewith to obtain an answer to both questions.  I\r\nhave housed in the same cage two elderly matrons laden with youngsters.\r\nEach has her home as far removed from the other's as the size of the\r\ncommon pan permits.  The distance is nine inches or more.  It is not\r\nenough.  Proximity soon kindles fierce jealousies between those\r\nintolerant creatures, who are obliged to live far apart, so as to secure\r\nadequate hunting-grounds.\r\n\r\nOne morning, I catch the two harridans fighting out their quarrel on the\r\nfloor.  The loser is laid flat upon her back; the victress, belly to\r\nbelly with her adversary, clutches her with her legs and prevents her\r\nfrom moving a limb.  Both have their poison-fangs wide open, ready to\r\nbite without yet daring, so mutually formidable are they.  After a\r\ncertain period of waiting, during which the pair merely exchange threats,\r\nthe stronger of the two, the one on top, closes her lethal engine and\r\ngrinds the head of the prostrate foe.  Then she calmly devours the\r\ndeceased by small mouthfuls.\r\n\r\nNow what do the youngsters do, while their mother is being eaten?  Easily\r\nconsoled, heedless of the atrocious scene, they climb on the conqueror's\r\nback and quietly take their places among the lawful family.  The ogress\r\nraises no objection, accepts them as her own.  She makes a meal off the\r\nmother and adopts the orphans.\r\n\r\nLet us add that, for many months yet, until the final emancipation comes,\r\nshe will carry them without drawing any distinction between them and her\r\nown young.  Henceforth, the two families, united in so tragic a fashion,\r\nwill form but one.  We see how greatly out of place it would be to speak,\r\nin this connection, of mother-love and its fond manifestations.\r\n\r\nDoes the Lycosa at least feed the younglings who, for seven months, swarm\r\nupon her back?  Does she invite them to the banquet when she has secured\r\na prize?  I thought so at first; and, anxious to assist at the family\r\nrepast, I devoted special attention to watching the mothers eat.  As a\r\nrule, the prey is consumed out of sight, in the burrow; but sometimes\r\nalso a meal is taken on the threshold, in the open air.  Besides, it is\r\neasy to rear the Lycosa and her family in a wire-gauze cage, with a layer\r\nof earth wherein the captive will never dream of sinking a well, such\r\nwork being out of season.  Everything then happens in the open.\r\n\r\nWell, while the mother munches, chews, expresses the juices and swallows,\r\nthe youngsters do not budge from their camping-ground on her back.  Not\r\none quits its place nor gives a sign of wishing to slip down and join in\r\nthe meal.  Nor does the mother extend an invitation to them to come and\r\nrecruit themselves, nor put any broken victuals aside for them.  She\r\nfeeds and the others look on, or rather remain indifferent to what is\r\nhappening.  Their perfect quiet during the Lycosa's feast points to the\r\nposession of a stomach that knows no cravings.\r\n\r\nThen with what are they sustained, during their seven months' upbringing\r\non the mother's back?  One conceives a notion of exudations supplied by\r\nthe bearer's body, in which case the young would feed on their mother,\r\nafter the manner of parasitic vermin, and gradually drain her strength.\r\n\r\nWe must abandon this notion.  Never are they seen to put their mouths to\r\nthe skin that should be a sort of teat to them.  On the other hand, the\r\nLycosa, far from being exhausted and shrivelling, keeps perfectly well\r\nand plump.  She has the same pot-belly when she finishes rearing her\r\nyoung as when she began.  She has not lost weight: far from it; on the\r\ncontrary, she has put on flesh: she has gained the wherewithal to beget a\r\nnew family next summer, one as numerous as to-day's.\r\n\r\nOnce more, with what do the little ones keep up their strength?  We do\r\nnot like to suggest reserves supplied by the egg as rectifying the\r\nbeastie's expenditure of vital force, especially when we consider that\r\nthose reserves, themselves so close to nothing, must be economized in\r\nview of the silk, a material of the highest importance, of which a\r\nplentiful use will be made presently.  There must be other powers at play\r\nin the tiny animal's machinery.\r\n\r\nTotal abstinence from food could be understood, if it were accompanied by\r\ninertia: immobility is not life.  But the young Lycosae, although usually\r\nquiet on their mother's back, are at all times ready for exercise and for\r\nagile swarming.  When they fall from the maternal perambulator, they\r\nbriskly pick themselves up, briskly scramble up a leg and make their way\r\nto the top.  It is a splendidly nimble and spirited performance.  Besides,\r\nonce seated, they have to keep a firm balance in the mass; they have to\r\nstretch and stiffen their little limbs in order to hang on to their\r\nneighbours.  As a matter of fact, there is no absolute rest for them.  Now\r\nphysiology teaches us that not a fibre works without some expenditure of\r\nenergy.  The animal, which can be likened, in no small measure, to our\r\nindustrial machines, demands, on the one hand, the renovation of its\r\norganism, which wears out with movement, and, on the other, the\r\nmaintenance of the heat transformed into action.  We can compare it with\r\nthe locomotive-engine.  As the iron horse performs its work, it gradually\r\nwears out its pistons, its rods, its wheels, its boiler-tubes, all of\r\nwhich have to be made good from time to time.  The founder and the smith\r\nrepair it, supply it, so to speak, with 'plastic food,' the food that\r\nbecomes embodied with the whole and forms part of it.  But, though it\r\nhave just come from the engine-shop, it is still inert.  To acquire the\r\npower of movement, it must receive from the stoker a supply of 'energy-\r\nproducing food;' in other words, he lights a few shovelfuls of coal in\r\nits inside.  This heat will produce mechanical work.\r\n\r\nEven so with the beast.  As nothing is made from nothing, the egg\r\nsupplies first the materials of the new-born animal; then the plastic\r\nfood, the smith of living creatures, increases the body, up to a certain\r\nlimit, and renews it as it wears away.  The stoker works at the same\r\ntime, without stopping.  Fuel, the source of energy, makes but a short\r\nstay in the system, where it is consumed and furnishes heat, whence\r\nmovement is derived.  Life is a fire-box.  Warmed by its food, the animal\r\nmachine moves, walks, runs, jumps, swims, flies, sets its locomotory\r\napparatus going in a thousand manners.\r\n\r\nTo return to the young Lycosae, they grow no larger until the period of\r\ntheir emancipation.  I find them at the age of seven months the same as\r\nwhen I saw them at their birth.  The egg supplied the materials necessary\r\nfor their tiny frames; and, as the loss of waste substance is, for the\r\nmoment, excessively small, or even _nil_, additional plastic food is not\r\nneeded so long as the beastie does not grow.  In this respect, the\r\nprolonged abstinence presents no difficulty.  But there remains the\r\nquestion of energy-producing food, which is indispensable, for the little\r\nLycosa moves, when necessary, and very actively at that.  To what shall\r\nwe attribute the heat expended upon action, when the animal takes\r\nabsolutely no nourishment?\r\n\r\nAn idea suggests itself.  We say to ourselves that, without being life, a\r\nmachine is something more than matter, for man has added a little of his\r\nmind to it.  Now the iron beast, consuming its ration of coal, is really\r\nbrowsing the ancient foliage of arborescent ferns in which solar energy\r\nhas accumulated.\r\n\r\nBeasts of flesh and blood act no otherwise.  Whether they mutually devour\r\none another or levy tribute on the plant, they invariably quicken\r\nthemselves with the stimulant of the sun's heat, a heat stored in grass,\r\nfruit, seed and those which feed on such.  The sun, the soul of the\r\nuniverse, is the supreme dispenser of energy.\r\n\r\nInstead of being served up through the intermediary of food and passing\r\nthrough the ignominious circuit of gastric chemistry, could not this\r\nsolar energy penetrate the animal directly and charge it with activity,\r\neven as the battery charges an accumulator with power?  Why not live on\r\nsun, seeing that, after all, we find naught but sun in the fruits which\r\nwe consume?\r\n\r\nChemical science, that bold revolutionary, promises to provide us with\r\nsynthetic food-stuffs.  The laboratory and the factory will take the\r\nplace of the farm.  Why should not physical science step in as well?  It\r\nwould leave the preparation of plastic food to the chemist's retorts; it\r\nwould reserve for itself that of energy-producing food, which, reduced to\r\nits exact terms, ceases to be matter.  With the aid of some ingenious\r\napparatus, it would pump into us our daily ration of solar energy, to be\r\nlater expended in movement, whereby the machine would be kept going\r\nwithout the often painful assistance of the stomach and its adjuncts.\r\nWhat a delightful world, where one would lunch off a ray of sunshine!\r\n\r\nIs it a dream, or the anticipation of a remote reality?  The problem is\r\none of the most important that science can set us.  Let us first hear the\r\nevidence of the young Lycosae regarding its possibilities.\r\n\r\nFor seven months, without any material nourishment, they expend strength\r\nin moving.  To wind up the mechanism of their muscles, they recruit\r\nthemselves direct with heat and light.  During the time when she was\r\ndragging the bag of eggs behind her, the mother, at the best moments of\r\nthe day, came and held up her pill to the sun.  With her two hind-legs,\r\nshe lifted it out of the ground, into the full light; slowly she turned\r\nit and returned it, so that every side might receive its share of the\r\nvivifying rays.  Well, this bath of life, which awakened the germs, is\r\nnow prolonged to keep the tender babes active.\r\n\r\nDaily, if the sky be clear, the Lycosa, carrying her young, comes up from\r\nthe burrow, leans on the kerb and spends long hours basking in the sun.\r\nHere, on their mother's back, the youngsters stretch their limbs\r\ndelightedly, saturate themselves with heat, take in reserves of motor\r\npower, absorb energy.\r\n\r\nThey are motionless; but, if I only blow upon them, they stampede as\r\nnimbly as though a hurricane were passing.  Hurriedly, they disperse;\r\nhurriedly, they reassemble: a proof that, without material nourishment,\r\nthe little animal machine is always at full pressure, ready to work.  When\r\nthe shade comes, mother and sons go down again, surfeited with solar\r\nemanations.  The feast of energy at the Sun Tavern is finished for the\r\nday.  It is repeated in the same way daily, if the weather be mild, until\r\nthe hour of emancipation comes, followed by the first mouthfuls of solid\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: THE NARBONNE LYCOSA: THE CLIMBING-INSTINCT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of March comes to an end; and the departure of the youngsters\r\nbegins, in glorious weather, during the hottest hours of the morning.\r\nLaden with her swarming burden, the mother Lycosa is outside her burrow,\r\nsquatting on the parapet at the entrance.  She lets them do as they\r\nplease; as though indifferent to what is happening, she exhibits neither\r\nencouragement nor regret.  Whoso will goes; whoso will remains behind.\r\n\r\nFirst these, then those, according as they feel themselves duly soaked\r\nwith sunshine, the little ones leave the mother in batches, run about for\r\na moment on the ground and then quickly reach the trellis-work of the\r\ncage, which they climb with surprising alacrity.  They pass through the\r\nmeshes, they clamber right to the top of the citadel.  All, with not one\r\nexception, make for the heights, instead of roaming on the ground, as\r\nmight reasonably be expected from the eminently earthly habits of the\r\nLycosae; all ascend the dome, a strange procedure whereof I do not yet\r\nguess the object.\r\n\r\nI receive a hint from the upright ring that finishes the top of the cage.\r\nThe youngsters hurry to it.  It represents the porch of their gymnasium.\r\nThey hang out threads across the opening; they stretch others from the\r\nring to the nearest points of the trellis-work.  On these foot-bridges,\r\nthey perform slack-rope exercises amid endless comings and goings.  The\r\ntiny legs open out from time to time and straddle as though to reach the\r\nmost distant points.  I begin to realize that they are acrobats aiming at\r\nloftier heights than those of the dome.\r\n\r\nI top the trellis with a branch that doubles the attainable height.  The\r\nbustling crowd hastily scrambles up it, reaches the tip of the topmost\r\ntwigs and thence sends out threads that attach themselves to every\r\nsurrounding object.  These form so many suspension-bridges; and my\r\nbeasties nimbly run along them, incessantly passing to and fro.  One\r\nwould say that they wished to climb higher still.  I will endeavour to\r\nsatisfy their desires.\r\n\r\nI take a nine-foot reed, with tiny branches spreading right up to the\r\ntop, and place it above the cage.  The little Lycosae clamber to the very\r\nsummit.  Here, longer threads are produced from the rope-yard and are now\r\nleft to float, anon converted into bridges by the mere contact of the\r\nfree end with the neighbouring supports.  The rope-dancers embark upon\r\nthem and form garlands which the least breath of air swings daintily.  The\r\nthread is invisible when it does not come between the eyes and the sun;\r\nand the whole suggests rows of Gnats dancing an aerial ballet.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, teased by the air-currents, the delicate mooring breaks\r\nand flies through space.  Behold the emigrants off and away, clinging to\r\ntheir thread.  If the wind be favourable, they can land at great\r\ndistances.  Their departure is thus continued for a week or two, in bands\r\nmore or less numerous, according to the temperature and the brightness of\r\nthe day.  If the sky be overcast, none dreams of leaving.  The travellers\r\nneed the kisses of the sun, which give energy and vigour.\r\n\r\nAt last, the whole family has disappeared, carried afar by its flying-\r\nropes.  The mother remains alone.  The loss of her offspring hardly seems\r\nto distress her.  She retains her usual colour and plumpness, which is a\r\nsign that the maternal exertions have not been too much for her.\r\n\r\nI also notice an increased fervour in the chase.  While burdened with her\r\nfamily, she was remarkably abstemious, accepting only with great reserve\r\nthe game placed at her disposal.  The coldness of the season may have\r\nmilitated against copious refections; perhaps also the weight of the\r\nlittle ones hampered her movements and made her more discreet in\r\nattacking the prey.\r\n\r\nTo-day, cheered by the fine weather and able to move freely, she hurries\r\nup from her lair each time I set a tit-bit to her liking buzzing at the\r\nentrance to her burrow; she comes and takes from my fingers the savoury\r\nLocust, the portly Anoxia; {26} and this performance is repeated daily,\r\nwhenever I have the leisure to devote to it.  After a frugal winter, the\r\ntime has come for plentiful repasts.\r\n\r\nThis appetite tells us that the animal is not at the point of death; one\r\ndoes not feast in this way with a played-out stomach.  My boarders are\r\nentering in full vigour upon their fourth year.  In the winter, in the\r\nfields, I used to find large mothers, carting their young, and others not\r\nmuch more than half their size.  The whole series, therefore, represented\r\nthree generations.  And now, in my earthenware pans, after the departure\r\nof the family, the old matrons still carry on and continue as strong as\r\never.  Every outward appearance tells us that, after becoming\r\ngreat-grandmothers, they still keep themselves fit for propagating their\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe facts correspond with these anticipations.  When September returns,\r\nmy captives are dragging a bag as bulky as that of last year.  For a long\r\ntime, even when the eggs of the others have been hatched for some weeks\r\npast, the mothers come daily to the threshold of the burrow and hold out\r\ntheir wallets for incubation by the sun.  Their perseverance is not\r\nrewarded: nothing issues from the satin purse; nothing stirs within.  Why?\r\nBecause, in the prison of my cages, the eggs have had no father.  Tired\r\nof waiting and at last recognizing the barrenness of their produce, they\r\npush the bag of eggs outside the burrow and trouble about it no more.  At\r\nthe return of spring, by which time the family, if developed according to\r\nrule, would have been emancipated, they die.  The mighty Spider of the\r\nwaste-lands, therefore, attains to an even more patriarchal age than her\r\nneighbour the Sacred Beetle: {27} she lives for five years at the very\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nLet us leave the mothers to their business and return to the youngsters.\r\nIt is not without a certain surprise that we see the little Lycosae, at\r\nthe first moment of their emancipation, hasten to ascend the heights.\r\nDestined to live on the ground, amidst the short grass, and afterwards to\r\nsettle in the permanent abode, a pit, they start by being enthusiastic\r\nacrobats.  Before descending to the low levels, their normal dwelling-\r\nplace, they affect lofty altitudes.\r\n\r\nTo rise higher and ever higher is their first need.  I have not, it\r\nseems, exhausted the limit of their climbing-instinct even with a nine-\r\nfoot pole, suitably furnished with branches to facilitate the escalade.\r\nThose who have eagerly reached the very top wave their legs, fumble in\r\nspace as though for yet higher stalks.  It behoves us to begin again and\r\nunder better conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Narbonne Lycosa, with her temporary yearning for the\r\nheights, is more interesting than other Spiders, by reason of the fact\r\nthat her usual habitation is underground, she is not so striking at\r\nswarming-time, because the youngsters, instead of all migrating at once,\r\nleave the mother at different periods and in small batches.  The sight\r\nwill be a finer one with the common Garden or Cross Spider, the Diadem\r\nEpeira (_Epeira diadema_, LIN.), decorated with three white crosses on\r\nher back.\r\n\r\nShe lays her eggs in November and dies with the first cold snap.  She is\r\ndenied the Lycosa's longevity.  She leaves the natal wallet early one\r\nspring and never sees the following spring.  This wallet, which contains\r\nthe eggs, has none of the ingenious structure which we admired in the\r\nBanded and in the Silky Epeira.  No longer do we see a graceful balloon-\r\nshape nor yet a paraboloid with a starry base; no longer a tough,\r\nwaterproof satin stuff; no longer a swan's-down resembling a fleecy,\r\nrusset cloud; no longer an inner keg in which the eggs are packed.  The\r\nart of stout fabrics and of walls within walls is unknown here.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Cross Spider is a pill of white silk, wrought into a\r\nyielding felt, through which the new-born Spiders will easily work their\r\nway, without the aid of the mother, long since dead, and without having\r\nto rely upon its bursting at the given hour.  It is about the size of a\r\ndamson.\r\n\r\nWe can judge the method of manufacture from the structure.  Like the\r\nLycosa, whom we saw, in Chapter III., at work in one of my earthenware\r\npans, the Cross Spider, on the support supplied by a few threads\r\nstretched between the nearest objects, begins by making a shallow saucer\r\nof sufficient thickness to dispense with subsequent corrections.  The\r\nprocess is easily guessed.  The tip of the abdomen goes up and down, down\r\nand up with an even beat, while the worker shifts her place a little.\r\nEach time, the spinnerets add a bit of thread to the carpet already made.\r\n\r\nWhen the requisite thickness is obtained, the mother empties her ovaries,\r\nin one continuous flow, into the centre of the bowl.  Glued together by\r\ntheir inherent moisture, the eggs, of a handsome orange-yellow, form a\r\nball-shaped heap.  The work of the spinnerets is resumed.  The ball of\r\ngerms is covered with a silk cap, fashioned in the same way as the\r\nsaucer.  The two halves of the work are so well joined that the whole\r\nconstitutes an unbroken sphere.\r\n\r\nThe Banded Epeira and the Silky Epeira, those experts in the manufacture\r\nof rainproof textures, lay their eggs high up, on brushwood and bramble,\r\nwithout shelter of any kind.  The thick material of the wallets is enough\r\nto protect the eggs from the inclemencies of the winter, especially from\r\ndamp.  The Diadem Epeira, or Cross Spider, needs a cranny for hers, which\r\nis contained in a non-waterproof felt.  In a heap of stones, well exposed\r\nto the sun, she will choose a large slab to serve as a roof.  She lodges\r\nher pill underneath it, in the company of the hibernating Snail.\r\n\r\nMore often still, she prefers the thick tangle of some dwarf shrub,\r\nstanding eight or nine inches high and retaining its leaves in winter.  In\r\nthe absence of anything better, a tuft of grass answers the purpose.\r\nWhatever the hiding-place, the bag of eggs is always near the ground,\r\ntucked away as well as may be, amid the surrounding twigs.\r\n\r\nSave in the case of the roof supplied by a large stone, we see that the\r\nsite selected hardly satisfies proper hygienic needs.  The Epeira seems\r\nto realize this fact.  By way of an additional protection, even under a\r\nstone, she never fails to make a thatched roof for her eggs.  She builds\r\nthem a covering with bits of fine, dry grass, joined together with a\r\nlittle silk.  The abode of the eggs becomes a straw wigwam.\r\n\r\nGood luck procures me two Cross Spiders' nests, on the edge of one of the\r\npaths in the enclosure, among some tufts of ground-cypress, or lavender-\r\ncotton.  This is just what I wanted for my plans.  The find is all the\r\nmore valuable as the period of the exodus is near at hand.\r\n\r\nI prepare two lengths of bamboo, standing about fifteen feet high and\r\nclustered with little twigs from top to bottom.  I plant one of them\r\nstraight up in the tuft, beside the first nest.  I clear the surrounding\r\nground, because the bushy vegetation might easily, thanks to threads\r\ncarried by the wind, divert the emigrants from the road which I have laid\r\nout for them.  The other bamboo I set up in the middle of the yard, all\r\nby itself, some few steps from any outstanding object.  The second nest\r\nis removed as it is, shrub and all, and placed at the bottom of the tall,\r\nragged distaff.\r\n\r\nThe events expected are not long in coming.  In the first fortnight in\r\nMay, a little earlier in one case, a little later in the other, the two\r\nfamilies, each presented with a bamboo climbing-pole, leave their\r\nrespective wallets.  There is nothing remarkable about the mode of\r\negress.  The precincts to be crossed consist of a very slack net-work,\r\nthrough which the outcomers wriggle: weak little orange-yellow beasties,\r\nwith a triangular black patch upon their sterns.  One morning is long\r\nenough for the whole family to make its appearance.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the emancipated youngsters climb the nearest twigs, clamber\r\nto the top, and spread a few threads.  Soon, they gather in a compact,\r\nball-shaped cluster, the size of a walnut.  They remain motionless.  With\r\ntheir heads plunged into the heap and their sterns projecting, they doze\r\ngently, mellowing under the kisses of the sun.  Rich in the possession of\r\na thread in their belly as their sole inheritance, they prepare to\r\ndisperse over the wide world.\r\n\r\nLet us create a disturbance among the globular group by stirring it with\r\na straw.  All wake up at once.  The cluster softly dilates and spreads,\r\nas though set in motion by some centrifugal force; it becomes a\r\ntransparent orb wherein thousands and thousands of tiny legs quiver and\r\nshake, while threads are extended along the way to be followed.  The\r\nwhole work resolves itself into a delicate veil which swallows up the\r\nscattered family.  We then see an exquisite nebula against whose\r\nopalescent tapestry the tiny animals gleam like twinkling orange stars.\r\n\r\nThis straggling state, though it last for hours, is but temporary.  If\r\nthe air grow cooler, if rain threaten, the spherical group reforms at\r\nonce.  This is a protective measure.  On the morning after a shower, I\r\nfind the families on either bamboo in as good condition as on the day\r\nbefore.  The silk veil and the pill formation have sheltered them well\r\nenough from the downpour.  Even so do Sheep, when caught in a storm in\r\nthe pastures, gather close, huddle together and make a common rampart of\r\ntheir backs.\r\n\r\nThe assembly into a ball-shaped mass is also the rule in calm, bright\r\nweather, after the morning's exertions.  In the afternoon, the climbers\r\ncollect at a higher point, where they weave a wide, conical tent, with\r\nthe end of a shoot for its top, and, gathered into a compact group, spend\r\nthe night there.  Next day, when the heat returns, the ascent is resumed\r\nin long files, following the shrouds which a few pioneers have rigged and\r\nwhich those who come after elaborate with their own work.\r\n\r\nCollected nightly into a globular troop and sheltered under a fresh tent,\r\nfor three or four days, each morning, before the sun grows too hot, my\r\nlittle emigrants thus raise themselves, stage by stage, on both bamboos,\r\nuntil they reach the sun-unit, at fifteen feet above the ground.  The\r\nclimb comes to an end for lack of foothold.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, the ascent would be shorter.  The young Spiders\r\nhave at their disposal the bushes, the brushwood, providing supports on\r\nevery side for the threads wafted hither and thither by the eddying air-\r\ncurrents.  With these rope-bridges flung across space, the dispersal\r\npresents no difficulties.  Each emigrant leaves at his own good time and\r\ntravels as suits him best.\r\n\r\nMy devices have changed these conditions somewhat.  My two bristling\r\npoles stand at a distance from the surrounding shrubs, especially the one\r\nwhich I planted in the middle of the yard.  Bridges are out of the\r\nquestion, for the threads flung into the air are not long enough.  And so\r\nthe acrobats, eager to get away, keep on climbing, never come down again,\r\nare impelled to seek in a higher position what they have failed to find\r\nin a lower.  The top of my two bamboos probably fails to represent the\r\nlimit of what my keen climbers are capable of achieving.\r\n\r\nWe shall see, in a moment, the object of this climbing-propensity, which\r\nis a sufficiently remarkable instinct in the Garden Spiders, who have as\r\ntheir domain the low-growing brushwood wherein their nets are spread; it\r\nbecomes a still more remarkable instinct in the Lycosa, who, except at\r\nthe moment when she leaves her mother's back, never quits the ground and\r\nyet, in the early hours of her life, shows herself as ardent a wooer of\r\nhigh places as the young Garden Spiders.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the Lycosa in particular.  In her, at the moment of the\r\nexodus, a sudden instinct arises, to disappear, as promptly and for ever,\r\na few hours later.  This is the climbing-instinct, which is unknown to\r\nthe adult and soon forgotten by the emancipated youngling, doomed to\r\nwander homeless, for many a long day, upon the ground.  Neither of them\r\ndreams of climbing to the top of a grass-stalk.  The full-grown Spider\r\nhunts trapper-fashion, ambushed in her tower; the young one hunts afoot\r\nthrough the scrubby grass.  In both cases there is no web and therefore\r\nno need for lofty contact-points.  They are not allowed to quit the\r\nground and climb the heights.\r\n\r\nYet here we have the young Lycosa, wishing to leave the maternal abode\r\nand to travel far afield by the easiest and swiftest methods, suddenly\r\nbecoming an enthusiastic climber.  Impetuously she scales the wire\r\ntrellis of the cage where she was born; hurriedly she clambers to the top\r\nof the tall mast which I have prepared for her.  In the same way, she\r\nwould make for the summit of the bushes in her waste-land.\r\n\r\nWe catch a glimpse of her object.  From on high, finding a wide space\r\nbeneath her, she sends a thread floating.  It is caught by the wind and\r\ncarries her hanging to it.  We have our aeroplanes; she too possesses her\r\nflying-machine.  Once the journey is accomplished, naught remains of this\r\ningenious business.  The climbing-instinct conies suddenly, at the hour\r\nof need, and no less suddenly vanishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII: THE SPIDERS' EXODUS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeds, when ripened in the fruit, are disseminated, that is to say,\r\nscattered on the surface of the ground, to sprout in spots as yet\r\nunoccupied and fill the expanses that realize favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nAmid the wayside rubbish grows one of the gourd family, _Ecbalium\r\nelaterium_, commonly called the squirting cucumber, whose fruit--a rough\r\nand extremely bitter little cucumber--is the size of a date.  When ripe,\r\nthe fleshy core resolves into a liquid in which float the seeds.\r\nCompressed by the elastic rind of the fruit, this liquid bears upon the\r\nbase of the footstalk, which is gradually forced out, yields like a\r\nstopper, breaks off and leaves an orifice through which a stream of seeds\r\nand fluid pulp is suddenly ejected.  If, with a novice hand, under a\r\nscorching sun, you shake the plant laden with yellow fruit, you are bound\r\nto be somewhat startled when you hear a noise among the leaves and\r\nreceive the cucumber's grapeshot in your face.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the garden balsam, when ripe, splits, at the least touch,\r\ninto five fleshy valves, which curl up and shoot their seeds to a\r\ndistance.  The botanical name of _Impatiens_ given to the balsam alludes\r\nto this sudden dehiscence of the capsules, which cannot endure contact\r\nwithout bursting.\r\n\r\nIn the damp and shady places of the woods there exists a plant of the\r\nsame family which, for similar reasons, bears the even more expressive\r\nname of _Impatiens noli-me-tangere_, or touch-me-not.\r\n\r\nThe capsule of the pansy expands into three valves, each scooped out like\r\na boat and laden in the middle with two rows of seeds.  When these valves\r\ndry, the edges shrivel, press upon the grains and eject them.\r\n\r\nLight seeds, especially those of the order of Compositae, have aeronautic\r\napparatus--tufts, plumes, fly-wheels--which keep them up in the air and\r\nenable them to take distant voyages.  In this way, at the least breath,\r\nthe seeds of the dandelion, surmounted by a tuft of feathers, fly from\r\ntheir dry receptacle and waft gently in the air.\r\n\r\nNext to the tuft, the wing is the most satisfactory contrivance for\r\ndissemination by wind.  Thanks to their membranous edge, which gives them\r\nthe appearance of thin scales, the seeds of the yellow wall-flower reach\r\nhigh cornices of buildings, clefts of inaccessible rocks, crannies in old\r\nwalls, and sprout in the remnant of mould bequeathed by the mosses that\r\nwere there before them.\r\n\r\nThe samaras, or keys, of the elm, formed of a broad, light fan with the\r\nseed cased in its centre; those of the maple, joined in pairs and\r\nresembling the unfurled wings of a bird; those of the ash, carved like\r\nthe blade of an oar, perform the most distant journeys when driven before\r\nthe storm.\r\n\r\nLike the plant, the insect also sometimes possesses travelling-apparatus,\r\nmeans of dissemination that allow large families to disperse quickly over\r\nthe country, so that each member may have his place in the sun without\r\ninjuring his neighbour; and these apparatus, these methods vie in\r\ningenuity with the elm's samara, the dandelion-plume and the catapult of\r\nthe squirting cucumber.\r\n\r\nLet us consider, in particular, the Epeirae, those magnificent Spiders\r\nwho, to catch their prey, stretch, between one bush and the next, great\r\nvertical sheets of meshes, resembling those of the fowler.  The most\r\nremarkable in my district is the Banded Epeira (_Epeira fasciata_,\r\nWALCK.), so prettily belted with yellow, black and silvery white.  Her\r\nnest, a marvel of gracefulness, is a satin bag, shaped like a tiny pear.\r\nIts neck ends in a concave mouthpiece closed with a lid, also of satin.\r\nBrown ribbons, in fanciful meridian waves, adorn the object from pole to\r\npole.\r\n\r\nOpen the nest.  We have seen, in an earlier chapter, {28} what we find\r\nthere; let us retell the story.  Under the outer wrapper, which is as\r\nstout as our woven stuffs and, moreover, perfectly waterproof, is a\r\nrusset eiderdown of exquisite delicacy, a silky fluff resembling driven\r\nsmoke.  Nowhere does mother-love prepare a softer bed.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this downy mass hangs a fine, silk, thimble-shaped\r\npurse, closed with a movable lid.  This contains the eggs, of a pretty\r\norange-yellow and about five hundred in number.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, is not this charming edifice an animal fruit, a\r\ngerm-casket, a capsule to be compared with that of the plants?  Only, the\r\nEpeira's wallet, instead of seeds, holds eggs.  The difference is more\r\napparent than real, for egg and grain are one.\r\n\r\nHow will this living fruit, ripening in the heat beloved of the Cicadae,\r\nmanage to burst?  How, above all, will dissemination take place?  They\r\nare there in their hundreds.  They must separate, go far away, isolate\r\nthemselves in a spot where there is not too much fear of competition\r\namong neighbours.  How will they set to work to achieve this distant\r\nexodus, weaklings that they are, taking such very tiny steps?\r\n\r\nI receive the first answer from another and much earlier Epeira, whose\r\nfamily I find, at the beginning of May, on a yucca in the enclosure.  The\r\nplant blossomed last year.  The branching flower-stem, some three feet\r\nhigh, still stands erect, though withered.  On the green leaves, shaped\r\nlike a sword-blade, swarm two newly-hatched families.  The wee beasties\r\nare a dull yellow, with a triangular black patch upon their stern.  Later\r\non, three white crosses, ornamenting the back, will tell me that my find\r\ncorresponds with the Cross or Diadem Spider (_Epeira diadema_, WALCK.).\r\n\r\nWhen the sun reaches this part of the enclosure, one of the two groups\r\nfalls into a great state of flutter.  Nimble acrobats that they are, the\r\nlittle Spiders scramble up, one after the other, and reach the top of the\r\nstem.  Here, marches and countermarches, tumult and confusion reign, for\r\nthere is a slight breeze which throws the troop into disorder.  I see no\r\nconnected manoeuvres.  From the top of the stalk they set out at every\r\nmoment, one by one; they dart off suddenly; they fly away, so to speak.\r\nIt is as though they had the wings of a Gnat.\r\n\r\nForthwith they disappear from view.  Nothing that my eyes can see\r\nexplains this strange flight; for precise observation is impossible amid\r\nthe disturbing influences out of doors.  What is wanted is a peaceful\r\natmosphere and the quiet of my study.\r\n\r\nI gather the family in a large box, which I close at once, and instal it\r\nin the animals' laboratory, on a small table, two steps from the open\r\nwindow.  Apprised by what I have just seen of their propensity to resort\r\nto the heights, I give my subjects a bundle of twigs, eighteen inches\r\ntall, as a climbing-pole.  The whole band hurriedly clambers up and\r\nreaches the top.  In a few moments there is not one lacking in the group\r\non high.  The future will tell us the reason of this assemblage on the\r\nprojecting tips of the twigs.\r\n\r\nThe little Spiders are now spinning here and there at random: they go up,\r\ngo down, come up again.  Thus is woven a light veil of divergent threads,\r\na many-cornered web with the end of the branch for its summit and the\r\nedge of the table for its base, some eighteen inches wide.  This veil is\r\nthe drill-ground, the work-yard where the preparations for departure are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nHere hasten the humble little creatures, running indefatigably to and\r\nfro.  When the sun shines upon them, they become gleaming specks and form\r\nupon the milky background of the veil a sort of constellation, a reflex\r\nof those remote points in the sky where the telescope shows us endless\r\ngalaxies of stars.  The immeasurably small and the immeasurably large are\r\nalike in appearance.  It is all a matter of distance.\r\n\r\nBut the living nebula is not composed of fixed stars; on the contrary,\r\nits specks are in continual movement.  The young Spiders never cease\r\nshifting their position on the web.  Many let themselves drop, hanging by\r\na length of thread, which the faller's weight draws from the spinnerets.\r\nThen quickly they climb up again by the same thread, which they wind\r\ngradually into a skein and lengthen by successive falls.  Others confine\r\nthemselves to running about the web and also give me the impression of\r\nworking at a bundle of ropes.\r\n\r\nThe thread, as a matter of fact, does not flow from the spinneret; it is\r\ndrawn thence with a certain effort.  It is a case of extraction, not\r\nemission.  To obtain her slender cord, the Spider has to move about and\r\nhaul, either by falling or by walking, even as the rope-maker steps\r\nbackwards when working his hemp.  The activity now displayed on the drill-\r\nground is a preparation for the approaching dispersal.  The travellers\r\nare packing up.\r\n\r\nSoon we see a few Spiders trotting briskly between the table and the open\r\nwindow.  They are running in mid-air.  But on what?  If the light fall\r\nfavourably, I manage to see, at moments, behind the tiny animal, a thread\r\nresembling a ray of light, which appears for an instant, gleams and\r\ndisappears.  Behind, therefore, there is a mooring, only just\r\nperceptible, if you look very carefully; but, in front, towards the\r\nwindow, there is nothing to be seen at all.\r\n\r\nIn vain I examine above, below, at the side; in vain I vary the direction\r\nof the eye: I can distinguish no support for the little creature to walk\r\nupon.  One would think that the beastie were paddling in space.  It\r\nsuggests the idea of a small bird, tied by the leg with a thread and\r\nmaking a flying rush forwards.\r\n\r\nBut, in this case, appearances are deceptive: flight is impossible; the\r\nSpider must necessarily have a bridge whereby to cross the intervening\r\nspace.  This bridge, which I cannot see, I can at least destroy.  I\r\ncleave the air with a ruler in front of the Spider making for the window.\r\nThat is quite enough: the tiny animal at once ceases to go forward and\r\nfalls.  The invisible foot-plank is broken.  My son, young Paul, who is\r\nhelping me, is astounded at this wave of the magic wand, for not even he,\r\nwith his fresh, young eyes, is able to see a support ahead for the\r\nSpiderling to move along.\r\n\r\nIn the rear, on the other hand, a thread is visible.  The difference is\r\neasily explained.  Every Spider, as she goes, at the same time spins a\r\nsafety-cord which will guard the rope-walker against the risk of an\r\nalways possible fall.  In the rear, therefore, the thread is of double\r\nthickness and can be seen, whereas, in front, it is still single and\r\nhardly perceptible to the eye.\r\n\r\nObviously, this invisible foot-bridge is not flung out by the animal: it\r\nis carried and unrolled by a gust of air.  The Epeira, supplied with this\r\nline, lets it float freely; and the wind, however softly blowing, bears\r\nit along and unwinds it.  Even so is the smoke from the bowl of a pipe\r\nwhirled up in the air.\r\n\r\nThis floating thread has but to touch any object in the neighbourhood and\r\nit will remain fixed to it.  The suspension-bridge is thrown; and the\r\nSpider can set out.  The South-American Indians are said to cross the\r\nabysses of the Cordilleras in travelling-cradles made of twisted\r\ncreepers; the little Spider passes through space on the invisible and the\r\nimponderable.\r\n\r\nBut to carry the end of the floating thread elsewhither a draught is\r\nneeded.  At this moment, the draught exists between the door of my study\r\nand the window, both of which are open.  It is so slight that I do not\r\nfeel its; I only know of it by the smoke from my pipe, curling softly in\r\nthat direction.  Cold air enters from without through the door; warm air\r\nescapes from the room through the window.  This is the drought that\r\ncarries the threads with it and enables the Spiders to embark upon their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nI get rid of it by closing both apertures and I break off any\r\ncommunication by passing my ruler between the window and the table.\r\nHenceforth, in the motionless atmosphere, there are no departures.  The\r\ncurrent of air is missing, the skeins are not unwound and migration\r\nbecomes impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is soon resumed, but in a direction whereof I never dreamt.  The hot\r\nsun is beating on a certain part of the floor.  At this spot, which is\r\nwarmer than the rest, a column of lighter, ascending air is generated.  If\r\nthis column catch the threads, my Spiders ought to rise to the ceiling of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe curious ascent does, in fact, take place.  Unfortunately, my troop,\r\nwhich has been greatly reduced by the number of departures through the\r\nwindow, does not lend itself to prolonged experiment.  We must begin\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, on the same yucca, I gather the second family, as\r\nnumerous as the first.  Yesterday's preparations are repeated.  My legion\r\nof Spiders first weaves a divergent framework between the top of the\r\nbrushwood placed at the emigrants' disposal and the edge of the table.\r\nFive or six hundred wee beasties swarm all over this work-yard.\r\n\r\nWhile this little world is busily fussing, making its arrangements for\r\ndeparture, I make my own.  Every aperture in the room is closed, so as to\r\nobtain as calm an atmosphere as possible.  A small chafing-dish is lit at\r\nthe foot of the table.  My hands cannot feel the heat of it at the level\r\nof the web whereon my Spiders are weaving.  This is the very modest fire\r\nwhich, with its column of rising air, shall unwind the threads and carry\r\nthem on high.\r\n\r\nLet us first enquire the direction and strength of the current.  Dandelion-\r\nplumes, made lighter by the removal of their seeds, serve as my guides.\r\nReleased above the chafing-dish, on the level of the table, they float\r\nslowly upwards and, for the most part, reach the ceiling.  The emigrants'\r\nlines should rise in the same way and even better.\r\n\r\nThe thing is done: with the aid of nothing that is visible to the three\r\nof us looking on, a Spider makes her ascent.  She ambles with her eight\r\nlegs through the air; she mounts, gently swaying.  The others, in ever-\r\nincreasing numbers, follow, sometimes by different roads, sometimes by\r\nthe same road.  Any one who did not possess the secret would stand amazed\r\nat this magic ascent without a ladder.  In a few minutes, most of them\r\nare up, clinging to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nNot all of them reach it.  I see some who, on attaining a certain height,\r\ncease to go up and even lose ground, although moving their legs forward\r\nwith all the nimbleness of which they are capable.  The more they\r\nstruggle upwards, the faster they come down.  This drifting, which\r\nneutralizes the distance covered and even converts it into a\r\nretrogression, is easily explained.\r\n\r\nThe thread has not reached the platform; it floats, it is fixed only at\r\nthe lower end.  As long as it is of a fair length, it is able, although\r\nmoving, to bear the minute animal's weight.  But, as the Spider climbs,\r\nthe float becomes shorter in proportion; and the time comes when a\r\nbalance is struck between the ascensional force of the thread and the\r\nweight carried.  Then the beastie remains stationary, although continuing\r\nto climb.\r\n\r\nPresently, the weight becomes too much for the shorter and shorter float;\r\nand the Spider slips down, in spite of her persistent, forward striving.\r\nShe is at last brought back to the branch by the falling threads.  Here,\r\nthe ascent is soon renewed, either on a fresh thread, if the supply of\r\nsilk be not yet exhausted, or on a strange thread, the work, of those who\r\nhave gone before.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the ceiling is reached.  It is twelve feet high.  The little\r\nSpider is able, therefore, as the first product of her spinning-mill,\r\nbefore taking any refreshment, to obtain a line fully twelve feet in\r\nlength.  And all this, the rope-maker and her rope, was contained in the\r\negg, a particle of no size at all.  To what a degree of fineness can the\r\nsilky matter be wrought wherewith the young Spider is provided!  Our\r\nmanufacturers are able to turn out platinum-wire that can only be seen\r\nwhen it is made red-hot.  With much simpler means, the Spiderling draws\r\nfrom her wire-mill threads so delicate that, even the brilliant light of\r\nthe sun does not always enable us to discern them.\r\n\r\nWe must not let all the climbers be stranded on the ceiling, an\r\ninhospitable region where most of them will doubtless perish, being\r\nunable to produce a second thread before they have had a meal.  I open\r\nthe window.  A current of lukewarm air, coming from the chafing-dish,\r\nescapes through the top.  Dandelion-plumes, taking that direction, tell\r\nme so.  The wafting threads cannot fail to be carried by this flow of air\r\nand to lengthen out in the open, where a light breeze is blowing.\r\n\r\nI take a pair of sharp scissors and, without shaking the threads, cut a\r\nfew that are just visible at the base, where they are thickened with an\r\nadded strand.  The result of this operation is marvellous.  Hanging to\r\nthe flying-rope, which is borne on the wind outside, the Spider passes\r\nthrough the window, suddenly flies off and disappears.  An easy way of\r\ntravelling, if the conveyance possessed a rudder that allowed the\r\npassenger to land where he pleases!  But the little things are at the\r\nmercy of the winds: where will they alight?  Hundreds, thousands of yards\r\naway, perhaps.  Let us wish them a prosperous journey.\r\n\r\nThe problem of dissemination is now solved.  What would happen if\r\nmatters, instead of being brought about by my wiles, took place in the\r\nopen fields?  The answer is obvious.  The young Spiders, born acrobats\r\nand rope-walkers, climb to the top of a branch so as to find sufficient\r\nspace below them to unfurl their apparatus.  Here, each draws from her\r\nrope-factory a thread which she abandons to the eddies of the air.  Gently\r\nraised by the currents that ascend from the ground warmed by the sun,\r\nthis thread wafts upwards, floats, undulates, makes for its point of\r\ncontact.  At last, it breaks and vanishes in the distance, carrying the\r\nspinstress hanging to it.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira with the three white crosses, the Spider who has supplied us\r\nwith these first data concerning the process of dissemination, is endowed\r\nwith a moderate maternal industry.  As a receptacle for the eggs, she\r\nweaves a mere pill of silk.  Her work is modest indeed beside the Banded\r\nEpeira's balloons.  I looked to these to supply me with fuller documents.\r\nI had laid up a store by rearing some mothers during the autumn.  So that\r\nnothing of importance might escape me, I divided my stock of balloons,\r\nmost of which were woven before my eyes, into two sections.  One half\r\nremained in my study, under a wire-gauze cover, with, small bunches of\r\nbrushwood as supports; the other half were experiencing the vicissitudes\r\nof open-air life on the rosemaries in the enclosure.\r\n\r\nThese preparations, which promised so well, did not provide me with the\r\nsight which I expected, namely, a magnificent exodus, worthy of the\r\ntabernacle occupied.  However, a few results, not devoid of interest, are\r\nto be noted.  Let us state them briefly.\r\n\r\nThe hatching takes place as March approaches.  When this time comes, let\r\nus open the Banded Epeira's nest with the scissors.  We shall find that\r\nsome of the youngsters have already left the central chamber and\r\nscattered over the surrounding eiderdown, while the rest of the laying\r\nstill consists of a compact mass of orange eggs.  The appearance of the\r\nyounglings is not simultaneous; it takes place with intermissions and may\r\nlast a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nNothing as yet suggests the future, richly-striped livery.  The abdomen\r\nis white and, as it were, floury in the front half; in the other half it\r\nis a blackish-brown.  The rest of the body is pale-yellow, except in\r\nfront, where the eyes form a black edging.  When left alone, the little\r\nones remain motionless in the soft, russet swan's-down; if disturbed,\r\nthey shuffle lazily where they are, or even walk about in a hesitating\r\nand unsteady fashion.  One can see that they have to ripen before\r\nventuring outside.\r\n\r\nMaturity is achieved in the exquisite floss that surrounds the natal\r\nchamber and fills out the balloon.  This is the waiting-room in which the\r\nbody hardens.  All dive into it as and when they emerge from the central\r\nkeg.  They will not leave it until four months later, when the midsummer\r\nheats have come.\r\n\r\nTheir number is considerable.  A patient and careful census gives me\r\nnearly six hundred.  And all this comes out of a purse no larger than a\r\npea.  By what miracle is there room for such a family?  How do those\r\nthousands of legs manage to grow without straining themselves?\r\n\r\nThe egg-bag, as we learnt in Chapter II., is a short cylinder rounded at\r\nthe bottom.  It is formed of compact white satin, an insuperable barrier.\r\nIt opens into a round orifice wherein is bedded a lid of the same\r\nmaterial, through which the feeble beasties would be incapable of\r\npassing.  It is not a porous felt, but a fabric as tough as that of the\r\nsack.  Then by what mechanism is the delivery effected?\r\n\r\nObserve that the disk of the lid doubles back into a short fold, which\r\nedges into the orifice of the bag.  In the same way, the lid of a\r\nsaucepan fits the mouth by means of a projecting rim, with this\r\ndifference, that the rim is not attached to the saucepan, whereas, in the\r\nEpeira's work, it is soldered to the bag or nest.  Well, at the time of\r\nthe hatching, this disk becomes unstuck, lifts and allows the new-born\r\nSpiders to pass through.\r\n\r\nIf the rim were movable and simply inserted, if, moreover, the birth of\r\nall the family took place at the same time, we might think that the door\r\nis forced open by the living wave of inmates, who would set their backs\r\nto it with a common effort.  We should find an approximate image in the\r\ncase of the saucepan, whose lid is raised by the boiling of its contents.\r\nBut the fabric of the cover is one with the fabric of the bag, the two\r\nare closely welded; besides, the hatching is effected in small batches,\r\nincapable of the least exertion.  There must, therefore, be a spontaneous\r\nbursting, or dehiscence, independent of the assistance of the youngsters\r\nand similar to that of the seed-pods of plants.\r\n\r\nWhen fully ripened, the dry fruit of the snap-dragon opens three windows;\r\nthat of the pimpernel splits into two rounded halves, something like\r\nthose of the outer case of a fob-watch; the fruit of the carnation partly\r\nunseals its valves and opens at the top into a star-shaped hatch.  Each\r\nseed-casket has its own system of locks, which are made to work smoothly\r\nby the mere kiss of the sun.\r\n\r\nWell, that other dry fruit, the Banded Epeira's germ-box, likewise\r\npossesses its bursting-gear.  As long as the eggs remain unhatched, the\r\ndoor, solidly fixed in its frame, holds good; as soon as the little ones\r\nswarm and want to get out, it opens of itself.\r\n\r\nCome June and July, beloved of the Cicadae, no less beloved of the young\r\nSpiders who are anxious to be off.  It were difficult indeed for them to\r\nwork their way through the thick shell of the balloon.  For the second\r\ntime, a spontaneous dehiscence seems called for.  Where will it be\r\neffected?\r\n\r\nThe idea occurs off-hand that it will take place along the edges of the\r\ntop cover.  Remember the details given in an earlier chapter.  The neck\r\nof the balloon ends in a wide crater, which is closed by a ceiling dug\r\nout cup-wise.  The material is as stout in this part as in any other;\r\nbut, as the lid was the finishing touch to the work, we expect to find an\r\nincomplete soldering, which would allow it to be unfastened.\r\n\r\nThe method of construction deceives us: the ceiling is immovable; at no\r\nseason can my forceps manage to extract it, without destroying the\r\nbuilding from top to bottom.  The dehiscence takes place elsewhere, at\r\nsome point on the sides.  Nothing informs us, nothing suggests to us that\r\nit will occur at one place rather than another.\r\n\r\nMoreover, to tell the truth, it is not a dehiscence prepared by means of\r\nsome dainty piece of mechanism; it is a very irregular tear.  Somewhat\r\nsharply, under the fierce heat of the sun, the satin bursts like the rind\r\nof an over-ripe pomegranate.  Judging by the result, we think of the\r\nexpansion of the air inside, which, heated by the sun, causes this\r\nrupture.  The signs of pressure from within are manifest: the tatters of\r\nthe torn fabric are turned outwards; also, a wisp of the russet eiderdown\r\nthat fills the wallet invariably straggles through the breach.  In the\r\nmidst of the protruding floss, the Spiderlings, expelled from their home\r\nby the explosion, are in frantic commotion.\r\n\r\nThe balloons of the Banded Epeira are bombs which, to free their\r\ncontents, burst under the rays of a torrid sun.  To break they need the\r\nfiery heat-waves of the dog-days.  When kept in the moderate atmosphere\r\nof my study, most of them do not open and the emergence of the young does\r\nnot take place, unless I myself I have a hand in the business; a few\r\nothers open with a round hole, a hole so neat that it might have been\r\nmade with a punch.  This aperture is the work of the prisoners, who,\r\nrelieving one another in turns, have, with a patient tooth, bitten\r\nthrough the stuff of the jar at some point or other.\r\n\r\nWhen exposed to the full force of the sun, however, on the rosemaries in\r\nthe enclosure, the balloons burst and shoot forth a ruddy flood of floss\r\nand tiny animals.  That is how things occur in the free sun-bath of the\r\nfields.  Unsheltered, among the bushes, the wallet of the Banded Epeira,\r\nwhen the July heat arrives, splits under the effort of the inner air.  The\r\ndelivery is effected by an explosion of the dwelling.\r\n\r\nA very small part of the family are expelled with the flow of tawny\r\nfloss; the vast majority remain in the bag, which is ripped open, but\r\nstill bulges with eiderdown.  Now that the breach is made, any one can go\r\nout who pleases, in his own good time, without hurrying.  Besides, a\r\nsolemn action has to be performed before the emigration.  The animal must\r\ncast its skin; and the moult is an event that does not fall on the same\r\ndate for all.  The evacuation of the place, therefore, lasts several\r\ndays.  It is effected in small squads, as the slough is flung aside.\r\n\r\nThose who sally forth climb up the neighbouring twigs and there, in the\r\nfull heat of the sun, proceed with the work of dissemination.  The method\r\nis the same as that which we saw in the case of the Cross Spider.  The\r\nspinnerets abandon to the breeze a thread that floats, breaks and flies\r\naway, carrying the rope-maker with it.  The number of starters on any one\r\nmorning is so small as to rob the spectacle of the greater part of its\r\ninterest.  The scene lacks animation because of the absence of a crowd.\r\n\r\nTo my intense disappointment, the Silky Epeira does not either indulge in\r\na tumultuous and dashing exodus.  Let me remind you of her handiwork, the\r\nhandsomest of the maternal wallets, next to the Banded Epeira's.  It is\r\nan obtuse conoid, closed with a star-shaped disk.  It is made of a\r\nstouter and especially a thicker material than the Banded Epeira's\r\nballoon, for which reason a spontaneous rupture becomes more necessary\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nThis rupture is effected at the sides of the bag, not far from the edge\r\nof the lid.  Like the ripping of the balloon, it requires the rough aid\r\nof the heat of July.  Its mechanism also seems to work by the expansion\r\nof the heated air, for we again see a partial emission of the silky floss\r\nthat fills the pouch.\r\n\r\nThe exit of the family is performed in a single group and, this time,\r\nbefore the moult, perhaps for lack of the space necessary for the\r\ndelicate casting of the skin.  The conical bag falls far short of the\r\nballoon in size; those packed within would sprain their legs in\r\nextracting them from their sheaths.  The family, therefore, emerges in a\r\nbody and settles on a sprig hard by.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary camping-ground, where, spinning in unison, the\r\nyoungsters soon weave an open-work tent, the abode of a week, or\r\nthereabouts.  The moult is effected in this lounge of intersecting\r\nthreads.  The sloughed skins form a heap at the bottom of the dwelling;\r\non the trapezes above, the flaylings take exercise and gain strength and\r\nvigour.  Finally, when maturity is attained, they set out, now these, now\r\nthose, little by little and always cautiously.  There are no audacious\r\nflights on the thready airship; the journey is accomplished by modest\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nHanging to her thread, the Spider lets herself drop straight down, to a\r\ndepth of nine or ten inches.  A breath of air sets her swinging like a\r\npendulum, sometimes drives her against a neighbouring branch.  This is a\r\nstep towards the dispersal.  At the point reached, there is a fresh fall,\r\nfollowed by a fresh pendulous swing that lands her a little farther\r\nafield.  Thus, in short tacks, for the thread is never very long, does\r\nthe Spiderling go about, seeing the country, until she comes to a place\r\nthat suits her.  Should the wind blow at all hard, the voyage is cut\r\nshort: the cable of the pendulum breaks and the beastie is carried for\r\nsome distance on its cord.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, although, on the whole, the tactics of the exodus remain much\r\nthe same, the two spinstresses of my region best-versed in the art of\r\nweaving mothers' wallets failed to come up to my expectations.  I went to\r\nthe trouble of rearing them, with disappointing results.  Where shall I\r\nfind again the wonderful spectacle which the Cross Spider offered me by\r\nchance?  I shall find it--in an even more striking fashion--among humbler\r\nSpiders, whom I had neglected to observe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII: THE CRAB SPIDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spider that showed me the exodus in all its magnificence is known\r\nofficially as _Thomisus onustus_, WALCK.  Though the name suggest nothing\r\nto the reader's mind, it has the advantage, at any rate, of hurting\r\nneither the throat nor the ear, as is too often the case with scientific\r\nnomenclature, which sounds more like sneezing than articulate speech.\r\nSince it is the rule to dignify plants and animals with a Latin label,\r\nlet us at least respect the euphony of the classics and refrain from\r\nharsh splutters which spit out a name instead of pronouncing it.\r\n\r\nWhat will posterity do in face of the rising tide of a barbarous\r\nvocabulary which, under the pretence of progress, stifles real knowledge?\r\nIt will relegate the whole business to the quagmire of oblivion.  But\r\nwhat will never disappear is the popular name, which sounds well, is\r\npicturesque and conveys some sort of information.  Such is the term Crab\r\nSpider, applied by the ancients to the group to which the Thomisus\r\nbelongs, a pretty accurate term, for, in this case, there is an evident\r\nanalogy between the Spider and the Crustacean.\r\n\r\nLike the Crab, the Thomisus walks sideways; she also has forelegs\r\nstronger than her hind-legs.  The only thing wanting to complete the\r\nresemblance is the front pair of stone gauntlets, raised in the attitude\r\nof self-defence.\r\n\r\nThe Spider with the Crab-like figure does not know how to manufacture\r\nnets for catching game.  Without springs or snares, she lies in ambush,\r\namong the flowers, and awaits the arrival of the quarry, which she kills\r\nby administering a scientific stab in the neck.  The Thomisus, in\r\nparticular, the subject of this chapter, is passionately addicted to the\r\npursuit of the Domestic Bee.  I have described the contests between the\r\nvictim and her executioner, at greater length, elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Bee appears, seeking no quarrel, intent upon plunder.  She tests the\r\nflowers with her tongue; she selects a spot that will yield a good\r\nreturn.  Soon she is wrapped up in her harvesting.  While she is filling\r\nher baskets and distending her crop, the Thomisus, that bandit lurking\r\nunder cover of the flowers, issues from her hiding-place, creeps round\r\nbehind the bustling insect, steals up close and, with a sudden rush, nabs\r\nher in the nape of the neck.  In vain, the Bee protests and darts her\r\nsting at random; the assailant does not let go.\r\n\r\nBesides, the bite in the neck is paralysing, because the cervical nerve-\r\ncentres are affected.  The poor thing's legs stiffen; and all is over in\r\na second.  The murderess now sucks the victim's blood at her ease and,\r\nwhen she has done, scornfully flings the drained corpse aside.  She hides\r\nherself once more, ready to bleed a second gleaner should the occasion\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nThis slaughter of the Bee engaged in the hallowed delights of labour has\r\nalways revolted me.  Why should there be workers to feed idlers, why\r\nsweated to keep sweaters in luxury?  Why should so many admirable lives\r\nbe sacrificed to the greater prosperity of brigandage?  These hateful\r\ndiscords amid the general harmony perplex the thinker, all the more as we\r\nshall see the cruel vampire become a model of devotion where her family\r\nis concerned.\r\n\r\nThe ogre loved his children; he ate the children of others.  Under the\r\ntyranny of the stomach, we are all of us, beasts and men alike, ogres.\r\nThe dignity of labour, the joy of life, maternal affection, the terrors\r\nof death: all these do not count, in others; the main point is that\r\nmorsel the be tender and savoury.\r\n\r\nAccording to the etymology of her name--[Greek text], a cord--the\r\nThomisus should be like the ancient lictor, who bound the sufferer to the\r\nstake.  The comparison is not inappropriate as regards many Spiders who\r\ntie their prey with a thread to subdue it and consume it at their ease;\r\nbut it just happens that the Thomisus is at variance with her label.  She\r\ndoes not fasten her Bee, who, dying suddenly of a bite in the neck,\r\noffers no resistance to her consumer.  Carried away by his recollection\r\nof the regular tactics, our Spider's godfather overlooked the exception;\r\nhe did not know of the perfidious mode of attack which renders the use of\r\na bow-string superfluous.\r\n\r\nNor is the second name of _onustus_--loaded, burdened, freighted--any too\r\nhappily chosen.  The fact that the Bee-huntress carries a heavy paunch is\r\nno reason to refer to this as a distinctive characteristic.  Nearly all\r\nSpiders have a voluminous belly, a silk-warehouse where, in some cases,\r\nthe rigging of the net, in others, the swan's-down of the nest is\r\nmanufactured.  The Thomisus, a first-class nest-builder, does like the\r\nrest: she hoards in her abdomen, but without undue display of obesity,\r\nthe wherewithal to house her family snugly.\r\n\r\nCan the expression _onustus_ refer simply to her slow and sidelong walk?\r\nThe explanation appeals to me, without satisfying me fully.  Except in\r\nthe case of a sudden alarm, every Spider maintains a sober gait and a\r\nwary pace.  When all is said, the scientific term is composed of a\r\nmisconception and a worthless epithet.  How difficult it is to name\r\nanimals rationally!  Let us be indulgent to the nomenclator: the\r\ndictionary is becoming exhausted and the constant flood that requires\r\ncataloguing mounts incessantly, wearing out our combinations of\r\nsyllables.\r\n\r\nAs the technical name tells the reader nothing, how shall he be informed?\r\nI see but one means, which is to invite him to the May festivals, in the\r\nwaste-lands of the South.  The murderess of the Bees is of a chilly\r\nconstitution; in our parts, she hardly ever moves away from the olive-\r\ndistricts.  Her favourite shrub is the white-leaved rock-rose (_Cistus\r\nalbidus_), with the large, pink, crumpled, ephemeral blooms that last but\r\na morning and are replaced, next day, by fresh flowers, which have\r\nblossomed in the cool dawn.  This glorious efflorescence goes on for five\r\nor six weeks.\r\n\r\nHere, the Bees plunder enthusiastically, fussing and bustling in the\r\nspacious whorl of the stamens, which beflour them with yellow.  Their\r\npersecutrix knows of this affluence.  She posts herself in her\r\nwatch-house, under the rosy screen of a petal.  Cast your eyes over the\r\nflower, more or less everywhere.  If you see a Bee lying lifeless, with\r\nlegs and tongue out-stretched, draw nearer: the Thomisus will be there,\r\nnine times out of ten.  The thug has struck her blow; she is draining the\r\nblood of the departed.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this cutter of Bees' throats is a pretty, a very pretty\r\ncreature, despite her unwieldy paunch fashioned like a squat pyramid and\r\nembossed on the base, on either side, with a pimple shaped like a camel's\r\nhump.  The skin, more pleasing to the eye than any satin, is milk-white\r\nin some, in others lemon-yellow.  There are fine ladies among them who\r\nadorn their legs with a number of pink bracelets and their back with\r\ncarmine arabesques.  A narrow pale-green ribbon sometimes edges the right\r\nand left of the breast.  It is not so rich as the costume of the Banded\r\nEpeira, but much more elegant because of its soberness, its daintiness\r\nand the artful blending of its hues.  Novice fingers, which shrink from\r\ntouching any other Spider, allow themselves to be enticed by these\r\nattractions; they do not fear to handle the beauteous Thomisus, so gentle\r\nin appearance.\r\n\r\nWell, what can this gem among Spiders do?  In the first place, she makes\r\na nest worthy of its architect.  With twigs and horse-hair and bits of\r\nwool, the Goldfinch, the Chaffinch and other masters of the builder's art\r\nconstruct an aerial bower in the fork of the branches.  Herself a lover\r\nof high places, the Thomisus selects as the site of her nest one of the\r\nupper twigs of the rock-rose, her regular hunting-ground, a twig withered\r\nby the heat and possessing a few dead leaves, which curl into a little\r\ncottage.  This is where she settles with a view to her eggs.\r\n\r\nAscending and descending with a gentle swing in more or less every\r\ndirection, the living shuttle, swollen with silk, weaves a bag whose\r\nouter casing becomes one with the dry leaves around.  The work, which is\r\npartly visible and partly hidden by its supports, is a pure dead-white.\r\nIts shape, moulded in the angular interval between the bent leaves, is\r\nthat of a cone and reminds us, on a smaller scale, of the nest of the\r\nSilky Epeira.\r\n\r\nWhen the eggs are laid, the mouth of the receptacle is hermetically\r\nclosed with a lid of the same white silk.  Lastly, a few threads,\r\nstretched like a thin curtain, form a canopy above the nest and, with the\r\ncurved tips of the leaves, frame a sort of alcove wherein the mother\r\ntakes up her abode.\r\n\r\nIt is more than a place of rest after the fatigues of her confinement: it\r\nis a guard-room, an inspection-post where the mother remains sprawling\r\nuntil the youngsters' exodus.  Greatly emaciated by the laying of her\r\neggs and by her expenditure of silk, she lives only for the protection of\r\nher nest.\r\n\r\nShould some vagrant pass near by, she hurries from her watch-tower, lifts\r\na limb and puts the intruder to flight.  If I tease her with a straw, she\r\nparries with big gestures, like those of a prize-fighter.  She uses her\r\nfists against my weapon.  When I propose to dislodge her in view of\r\ncertain experiments, I find some difficulty in doing so.  She clings to\r\nthe silken floor, she frustrates my attacks, which I am bound to moderate\r\nlest I should injure her.  She is no sooner attracted outside than she\r\nstubbornly returns to her post.  She declines to leave her treasure.\r\n\r\nEven so does the Narbonne Lycosa struggle when we try to take away her\r\npill.  Each displays the same pluck and the same devotion; and also the\r\nsame denseness in distinguishing her property from that of others.  The\r\nLycosa accepts without hesitation any strange pill which she is, given in\r\nexchange for her own; she confuses alien produce with the produce of her\r\novaries and her silk-factory.  Those hallowed words, maternal love, were\r\nout of place here: it is an impetuous, an almost mechanical impulse,\r\nwherein real affection plays no part whatever.  The beautiful Spider of\r\nthe rock-roses is no more generously endowed.  When moved from her nest\r\nto another of the same kind, she settles upon it and never stirs from it,\r\neven though the different arrangement of the leafy fence be such as to\r\nwarn her that she is not really at home.  Provided that she have satin\r\nunder her feet, she does not notice her mistake; she watches over\r\nanother's nest with the same vigilance which she might show in watching\r\nover her own.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa surpasses her in maternal blindness.  She fastens to her\r\nspinnerets and dangles, by way of a bag of eggs, a ball of cork polished\r\nwith my file, a paper pellet, a little ball of thread.  In order to\r\ndiscover if the Thomisus is capable of a similar error, I gathered some\r\nbroken pieces of silk-worm's cocoon into a closed cone, turning the\r\nfragments so as to bring the smoother and more delicate inner surface\r\noutside.  My attempt was unsuccessful.  When removed from her home and\r\nplaced on the artificial wallet, the mother Thomisus obstinately refused\r\nto settle there.  Can she be more clear-sighted than the Lycosa?  Perhaps\r\nso.  Let us not be too extravagant with our praise, however; the\r\nimitation of the bag was a very clumsy one.\r\n\r\nThe work of laying is finished by the end of May, after which, lying flat\r\non the ceiling of her nest, the mother never leaves her guard-room,\r\neither by night or day.  Seeing her look so thin and wrinkled, I imagine\r\nthat I can please her by bringing her a provision of Bees, as I was wont\r\nto do.  I have misjudged her needs.  The Bee, hitherto her favourite\r\ndish, tempts her no longer.  In vain does the prey buzz close by, an easy\r\ncapture within the cage: the watcher does not shift from her post, takes\r\nno notice of the windfall.  She lives exclusively upon maternal devotion,\r\na commendable but unsubstantial fare.  And so I see her pining away from\r\nday to day, becoming more and more wrinkled.  What is the withered thing\r\nwaiting for, before expiring?  She is waiting for her children to emerge;\r\nthe dying creature is still of use to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Banded Epeira's little ones issue from their balloon, they have\r\nlong been orphans.  There is none to come to their assistance; and they\r\nhave not the strength to free themselves unaided.  The balloon has to\r\nsplit automatically and to scatter the youngsters and their flossy\r\nmattress all mixed up together.  The Thomisus' wallet, sheathed in leaves\r\nover the greater part of its surface, never bursts; nor does the lid\r\nrise, so carefully is it sealed down.  Nevertheless, after the delivery\r\nof the brood, we see, at the edge of the lid, a small, gaping hole, an\r\nexit-window.  Who contrived this window, which was not there at first?\r\n\r\nThe fabric is too thick and tough to have yielded to the twitches of the\r\nfeeble little prisoners.  It was the mother, therefore, who, feeling her\r\noffspring shuffle impatiently under the silken ceiling, herself made a\r\nhole in the bag.  She persists in living for five or six weeks, despite\r\nher shattered health, so as to give a last helping hand and open the door\r\nfor her family.  After performing this duty, she gently lets herself die,\r\nhugging her nest and turning into a shrivelled relic.\r\n\r\nWhen July comes, the little ones emerge.  In view of their acrobatic\r\nhabits, I have placed a bundle of slender twigs at the top of the cage in\r\nwhich they were born.  All of them pass through the wire gauze and form a\r\ngroup on the summit of the brushwood, where they swiftly weave a spacious\r\nlounge of criss-cross threads.  Here they remain, pretty quietly, for a\r\nday or two; then foot-bridges begin to be flung from one object to the\r\nnext.  This is the opportune moment.\r\n\r\nI put the bunch laden with beasties on a small table, in the shade,\r\nbefore the open window.  Soon, the exodus commences, but slowly and\r\nunsteadily.  There are hesitations, retrogressions, perpendicular falls\r\nat the end of a thread, ascents that bring the hanging Spider up again.\r\nIn short much ado for a poor result.\r\n\r\nAs matters continue to drag, it occurs to me, at eleven o'clock, to take\r\nthe bundle of brushwood swarming with the little Spiders, all eager to be\r\noff, and place it on the window-sill, in the glare of the sun.  After a\r\nfew minutes of heat and light, the scene assumes a very different aspect.\r\nThe emigrants run to the top of the twigs, bustle about actively.  It\r\nbecomes a bewildering rope-yard, where thousands of legs are drawing the\r\nhemp from the spinnerets.  I do not see the ropes manufactured and sent\r\nfloating at the mercy of the air; but I guess their presence.\r\n\r\nThree or four Spiders start at a time, each going her own way in\r\ndirections independent of her neighbours'.  All are moving upwards, all\r\nare climbing some support, as can be perceived by the nimble motion of\r\ntheir legs.  Moreover, the road is visible behind the climber, it is of\r\ndouble thickness, thanks to an added thread.  Then, at a certain height,\r\nindividual movement ceases.  The tiny animal soars in space and shines,\r\nlit up by the sun.  Softly it sways, then suddenly takes flight.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened?  There is a slight breeze outside.  The floating cable\r\nhas snapped and the creature has gone off, borne on its parachute.  I see\r\nit drifting away, showing, like a spot of light, against the dark foliage\r\nof the near cypresses, some forty feet distant.  It rises higher, it\r\ncrosses over the cypress-screen, it disappears.  Others follow, some\r\nhigher, some lower, hither and thither.\r\n\r\nBut the throng has finished its preparations; the hour has come to\r\ndisperse in swarms.  We now see, from the crest of the brushwood, a\r\ncontinuous spray of starters, who shoot up like microscopic projectiles\r\nand mount in a spreading cluster.  In the end, it is like the bouquet at\r\nthe finish of a pyrotechnic display, the sheaf of rockets fired\r\nsimultaneously.  The comparison is correct down to the dazzling light\r\nitself.  Flaming in the sun like so many gleaming points, the little\r\nSpiders are the sparks of that living firework.  What a glorious send-\r\noff! What an entrance into the world!  Clutching its aeronautic thread,\r\nthe minute creature mounts in an apotheosis.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, nearer or farther, the fall comes.  To live, we have to\r\ndescend, often very low, alas!  The Crested Lark crumbles the\r\nmule-droppings in the road and thus picks up his food, the oaten grain\r\nwhich he would never find by soaring in the sky, his throat swollen with\r\nsong.  We have to descend; the stomach's inexorable claims demand it.  The\r\nSpiderling, therefore, touches land.  Gravity, tempered by the parachute,\r\nis kind to her.\r\n\r\nThe rest of her story escapes me.  What infinitely tiny Midges does she\r\ncapture before possessing the strength to stab her Bee?  What are the\r\nmethods, what the wiles of atom contending with atom?  I know not.  We\r\nshall find her again in spring, grown quite large and crouching among the\r\nflowers whence the Bee takes toll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX: THE GARDEN SPIDERS: BUILDING THE WEB\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fowling-snare is one of man's ingenious villainies.  With lines, pegs\r\nand poles, two large, earth-coloured nets are stretched upon the ground,\r\none to the right, the other to the left of a bare surface.  A long cord,\r\npulled, at the right moment, by the fowler, who hides in a brushwood hut,\r\nworks them and brings them together suddenly, like a pair of shutters.\r\n\r\nDivided between the two nets are the cages of the decoy-birds--Linnets\r\nand Chaffinches, Greenfinches and Yellowhammers, Buntings and\r\nOrtolans--sharp-eared creatures which, on perceiving the distant passage\r\nof a flock of their own kind, forthwith utter a short calling note.  One\r\nof them, the _Sambe_, an irresistible tempter, hops about and flaps his\r\nwings in apparent freedom.  A bit of twine fastens him to his convict's\r\nstake.  When, worn with fatigue and driven desperate by his vain attempts\r\nto get away, the sufferer lies down flat and refuses to do his duty, the\r\nfowler is able to stimulate him without stirring from his hut.  A long\r\nstring sets in motion a little lever working on a pivot.  Raised from the\r\nground by this diabolical contrivance, the bird flies, falls down and\r\nflies up again at each jerk of the cord.\r\n\r\nThe fowler waits, in the mild sunlight of the autumn morning.  Suddenly,\r\ngreat excitement in the cages.  The Chaffinches chirp their rallying-cry:\r\n\r\n'Pinck!  Pinck!'\r\n\r\nThere is something happening in the sky.  The _Sambe_, quick!  They are\r\ncoming, the simpletons; they swoop down upon the treacherous floor.  With\r\na rapid movement, the man in ambush pulls his string.  The nets close and\r\nthe whole flock is caught.\r\n\r\nMan has wild beast's blood in his veins.  The fowler hastens to the\r\nslaughter.  With his thumb, he stifles the beating of the captives'\r\nhearts, staves in their skulls.  The little birds, so many piteous heads\r\nof game, will go to market, strung in dozens on a wire passed through\r\ntheir nostrils.\r\n\r\nFor scoundrelly ingenuity the Epeira's net can bear comparison with the\r\nfowler's; it even surpasses it when, on patient study, the main features\r\nof its supreme perfection stand revealed.  What refinement of art for a\r\nmess of Flies!  Nowhere, in the whole animal kingdom, has the need to eat\r\ninspired a more cunning industry.  If the reader will meditate upon the\r\ndescription that follows, he will certainly share my admiration.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we must witness the making of the net; we must see it\r\nconstructed and see it again and again, for the plan of such a complex\r\nwork can only be grasped in fragments.  To-day, observation will give us\r\none detail; to-morrow, it will give us a second, suggesting fresh points\r\nof view; as our visits multiply, a new fact is each time added to the sum\r\ntotal of the acquired data, confirming those which come before or\r\ndirecting our thoughts along unsuspected paths.\r\n\r\nThe snow-ball rolling over the carpet of white grows enormous, however\r\nscanty each fresh layer be.  Even so with truth in observational science:\r\nit is built up of trifles patiently gathered together.  And, while the\r\ncollecting of these trifles means that the student of Spider industry\r\nmust not be chary of his time, at least it involves no distant and\r\nspeculative research.  The smallest garden contains Epeirae, all\r\naccomplished weavers.\r\n\r\nIn my enclosure, which I have stocked carefully with the most famous\r\nbreeds, I have six different species under observation, all of a useful\r\nsize, all first-class spinners.  Their names are the Banded Epeira\r\n(_Epeira fasciata_, WALCK.), the Silky Epeira (_E. sericea_, WALCK.), the\r\nAngular Epeira (_E. angulata_, WALCK.), the Pale-tinted Epeira (_E.\r\npallida_, OLIV.), the Diadem Epeira, or Cross Spider (_E. diadema_,\r\nCLERK.), and the Crater Epeira (_E. cratera_, WALCK.).\r\n\r\nI am able, at the proper hours, all through the fine season, to question\r\nthem, to watch them at work, now this one, anon that, according to the\r\nchances of the day.  What I did not see very plainly yesterday I can see\r\nthe next day, under better conditions, and on any of the following days,\r\nuntil the phenomenon under observation is revealed in all clearness.\r\n\r\nLet us go every evening, step by step, from one border of tall rosemaries\r\nto the next.  Should things move too slowly, we will sit down at the foot\r\nof the shrubs, opposite the rope-yard, where the light falls favourably,\r\nand watch with unwearying attention.  Each trip will be good for a fact\r\nthat fills some gap in the ideas already gathered.  To appoint one's\r\nself, in this way, an inspector of Spiders' webs, for many years in\r\nsuccession and for long seasons, means joining a not overcrowded\r\nprofession, I admit.  Heaven knows, it does not enable one to put money\r\nby!  No matter: the meditative mind returns from that school fully\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nTo describe the separate progress of the work in the case of each of the\r\nsix Epeirae mentioned would be a useless repetition: all six employ the\r\nsame methods and weave similar webs, save for certain details that shall\r\nbe set forth later.  I will, therefore, sum up in the aggregate the\r\nparticulars supplied by one or other of them.\r\n\r\nMy subjects, in the first instance, are young and boast but a slight\r\ncorporation, very far removed from what it will be in the late autumn.\r\nThe belly, the wallet containing the rope-works, hardly exceeds a\r\npeppercorn in bulk.  This slenderness on the part of the spinstresses\r\nmust not prejudice us against their work: there is no parity between\r\ntheir skill and their years.  The adult Spiders, with their disgraceful\r\npaunches, can do no better.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the beginners have one very precious advantage for the\r\nobserver: they work by day, work even in the sun, whereas the old ones\r\nweave only at night, at unseasonable hours.  The first show us the\r\nsecrets of their looms without much difficulty; the others conceal them\r\nfrom us.  Work starts in July, a couple of hours before sunset.\r\n\r\nThe spinstresses of my enclosure then leave their daytime hiding-places,\r\nselect their posts and begin to spin, one here, another there.  There are\r\nmany of them; we can choose where we please.  Let us stop in front of\r\nthis one, whom we surprise in the act of laying the foundations of the\r\nstructure.  Without any appreciable order, she runs about the rosemary-\r\nhedge, from the tip of one branch to another within the limits of some\r\neighteen inches.  Gradually, she puts a thread in position, drawing it\r\nfrom her wire-mill with the combs attached to her hind-legs.  This\r\npreparatory work presents no appearance of a concerted plan.  The Spider\r\ncomes and goes impetuously, as though at random; she goes up, comes down,\r\ngoes up again, dives down again and each time strengthens the points of\r\ncontact with intricate moorings distributed here and there.  The result\r\nis a scanty and disordered scaffolding.\r\n\r\nIs disordered the word?  Perhaps not.  The Epeira's eye, more experienced\r\nin matters of this sort than mine, has recognized the general lie of the\r\nland; and the rope-fabric has been erected accordingly: it is very\r\ninaccurate in my opinion, but very suitable for the Spider's designs.\r\nWhat is it that she really wants?  A solid frame to contain the network\r\nof the web.  The shapeless structure which she has just built fulfils the\r\ndesired conditions: it marks out a flat, free and perpendicular area.\r\nThis is all that is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe whole work, for that matter, is now soon completed; it is done all\r\nover again, each evening, from top to bottom, for the incidents of the\r\nchase destroy it in a night.  The net is as yet too delicate to resist\r\nthe desperate struggles of the captured prey.  On the other hand, the\r\nadults' net, which is formed of stouter threads, is adapted to last some\r\ntime; and the Epeira gives it a more carefully-constructed framework, as\r\nwe shall see elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA special thread, the foundation of the real net, is stretched across the\r\narea so capriciously circumscribed.  It is distinguished from the others\r\nby its isolation, its position at a distance from any twig that might\r\ninterfere with its swaying length.  It never fails to have, in the\r\nmiddle, a thick white point, formed of a little silk cushion.  This is\r\nthe beacon that marks the centre of the future edifice, the post that\r\nwill guide the Epeira and bring order into the wilderness of twists and\r\nturns.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to weave the hunting-snare.  The Spider starts from the\r\ncentre, which bears the white signpost, and, running along the\r\ntransversal thread, hurriedly reaches the circumference, that is to say,\r\nthe irregular frame enclosing the free space.  Still with the same sudden\r\nmovement, she rushes from the circumference to the centre; she starts\r\nagain backwards and forwards, makes for the right, the left, the top, the\r\nbottom; she hoists herself up, dives down, climbs up again, runs down and\r\nalways returns to the central landmark by roads that slant in the most\r\nunexpected manner.  Each time, a radius or spoke is laid, here, there, or\r\nelsewhere, in what looks like mad disorder.\r\n\r\nThe operation is so erratically conducted that it takes the most\r\nunremitting attention to follow it at all.  The Spider reaches the margin\r\nof the area by one of the spokes already placed.  She goes along this\r\nmargin for some distance from the point at which she landed, fixes her\r\nthread to the frame and returns to the centre by the same road which she\r\nhas just taken.\r\n\r\nThe thread obtained on the way in a broken line, partly on the radius and\r\npartly on the frame, is too long for the exact distance between the\r\ncircumference and the central point.  On returning to this point, the\r\nSpider adjusts her thread, stretches it to the correct length, fixes it\r\nand collects what remains on the central signpost.  In the case of each\r\nradius laid, the surplus is treated in the same fashion, so that the\r\nsignpost continues to increase in size.  It was first a speck; it is now\r\na little pellet, or even a small cushion of a certain breadth.\r\n\r\nWe shall see presently what becomes of this cushion whereon the Spider,\r\nthat niggardly housewife, lays her saved-up bits of thread; for the\r\nmoment, we will note that the Epeira works it up with her legs after\r\nplacing each spoke, teazles it with her claws, mats it into felt with\r\nnoteworthy diligence.  In so doing, she gives the spokes a solid common\r\nsupport, something like the hub of our carriage-wheels.\r\n\r\nThe eventual regularity of the work suggests that the radii are spun in\r\nthe same order in which they figure in the web, each following\r\nimmediately upon its next neighbour.  Matters pass in another manner,\r\nwhich at first looks like disorder, but which is really a judicious\r\ncontrivance.  After setting a few spokes in one direction, the Epeira\r\nruns across to the other side to draw some in the opposite direction.\r\nThese sudden changes of course are highly logical; they show us how\r\nproficient the Spider is in the mechanics of rope-construction.  Were\r\nthey to succeed one another regularly, the spokes of one group, having\r\nnothing as yet to counteract them, would distort the work by their\r\nstraining, would even destroy it for lack of a stabler support.  Before\r\ncontinuing, it is necessary to lay a converse group which will maintain\r\nthe whole by its resistance.  Any combination of forces acting in one\r\ndirection must be forthwith neutralized by another in the opposite\r\ndirection.  This is what our statics teach us and what the Spider puts\r\ninto practice; she is a past mistress of the secrets of rope-building,\r\nwithout serving an apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nOne would think that this interrupted and apparently disordered labour\r\nmust result in a confused piece of work.  Wrong: the rays are equidistant\r\nand form a beautifully-regular orb.  Their number is a characteristic\r\nmark of the different species.  The Angular Epeira places 21 in her web,\r\nthe Banded Epeira 32, the Silky Epeira 42.  These numbers are not\r\nabsolutely fixed; but the variation is very slight.\r\n\r\nNow which of us would undertake, off-hand, without much preliminary\r\nexperiment and without measuring-instruments, to divide a circle into a\r\ngiven quantity of sectors of equal width?  The Epeirae, though weighted\r\nwith a wallet and tottering on threads shaken by the wind, effect the\r\ndelicate division without stopping to think.  They achieve it by a method\r\nwhich seems mad according to our notions of geometry.  Out of disorder\r\nthey evolve order.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, give them more than their due.  The angles are only\r\napproximately equal; they satisfy the demands of the eye, but cannot\r\nstand the test of strict measurement.  Mathematical precision would be\r\nsuperfluous here.  No matter, we are amazed at the result obtained.  How\r\ndoes the Epeira come to succeed with her difficult problem, so strangely\r\nmanaged?  I am still asking myself the question.\r\n\r\nThe laying of the radii is finished.  The Spider takes her place in the\r\ncentre, on the little cushion formed of the inaugural signpost and the\r\nbits of thread left over.  Stationed on this support, she slowly turns\r\nround and round.  She is engaged on a delicate piece of work.  With an\r\nextremely thin thread, she describes from spoke to spoke, starting from\r\nthe centre, a spiral line with very close coils.  The central space thus\r\nworked attains, in the adults' webs, the dimensions of the palm of one's\r\nhand; in the younger Spiders' webs, it is much smaller, but it is never\r\nabsent.  For reasons which I will explain in the course of this study, I\r\nshall call it, in future, the 'resting-floor.'\r\n\r\nThe thread now becomes thicker.  The first could hardly be seen; the\r\nsecond is plainly visible.  The Spider shifts her position with great\r\nslanting strides, turns a few times, moving farther and farther from the\r\ncentre, fixes her line each time to the spoke which she crosses and at\r\nlast comes to a stop at the lower edge of the frame.  She has described a\r\nspiral with coils of rapidly-increasing width.  The average distance\r\nbetween the coils, even in the structures of the young Epeirae, is one\r\ncentimetre. {29}\r\n\r\nLet us not be misled by the word 'spiral,' which conveys the notion of a\r\ncurved line.  All curves are banished from the Spiders' work; nothing is\r\nused but the straight line and its combinations.  All that is aimed at is\r\na polygonal line drawn in a curve as geometry understands it.  To this\r\npolygonal line, a work destined to disappear as the real toils are woven,\r\nI will give the name of the 'auxiliary spiral.'  Its object is to supply\r\ncross-bars, supporting rungs, especially in the outer zone, where the\r\nradii are too distant from one another to afford a suitable groundwork.\r\nIts object is also to guide the Epeira in the extremely delicate business\r\nwhich she is now about to undertake.\r\n\r\nBut, before that, one last task becomes essential.  The area occupied by\r\nthe spokes is very irregular, being marked out by the supports of the\r\nbranch, which are infinitely variable.  There are angular niches which,\r\nif skirted too closely, would disturb the symmetry of the web about to be\r\nconstructed.  The Epeira needs an exact space wherein gradually to lay\r\nher spiral thread.  Moreover, she must not leave any gaps through which\r\nher prey might find an outlet.\r\n\r\nAn expert in these matters, the Spider soon knows the corners that have\r\nto be filled up.  With an alternating movement, first in this direction,\r\nthen in that, she lays, upon the support of the radii, a thread that\r\nforms two acute angles at the lateral boundaries of the faulty part and\r\ndescribes a zigzag line not wholly unlike the ornament known as the fret.\r\n\r\nThe sharp corners have now been filled with frets on every side; the time\r\nhas come to work at the essential part, the snaring-web for which all the\r\nrest is but a support.  Clinging on the one hand to the radii, on the\r\nother to the chords of the auxiliary spiral, the Epeira covers the same\r\nground as when laying the spiral, but in the opposite direction:\r\nformerly, she moved away from the centre; now she moves towards it and\r\nwith closer and more numerous circles.  She starts from the base of the\r\nauxiliary spiral, near the frame.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is difficult to observe, for the movements are very quick\r\nand spasmodic, consisting of a series of sudden little rushes, sways and\r\nbends that bewilder the eye.  It needs continuous attention and repeated\r\nexamination to distinguish the progress of the work however slightly.\r\n\r\nThe two hind-legs, the weaving implements, keep going constantly.  Let us\r\nname them according to their position on the work-floor.  I call the leg\r\nthat faces the centre of the coil, when the animal moves, the 'inner\r\nleg;' the one outside the coil the 'outer leg.'\r\n\r\nThe latter draws the thread from the spinneret and passes it to the inner\r\nleg, which, with a graceful movement, lays it on the radius crossed.  At\r\nthe same time, the first leg measures the distance; it grips the last\r\ncoil placed in position and brings within a suitable range that point of\r\nthe radius whereto the thread is to be fixed.  As soon as the radius is\r\ntouched, the thread sticks to it by its own glue.  There are no slow\r\noperations, no knots: the fixing is done of itself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, turning by narrow degrees, the spinstress approaches the\r\nauxiliary chords that have just served as her support.  When, in the end,\r\nthese chords become too close, they will have to go; they would impair\r\nthe symmetry of the work.  The Spider, therefore, clutches and holds on\r\nto the rungs of a higher row; she picks up, one by one, as she goes\r\nalong, those which are of no more use to her and gathers them into a fine-\r\nspun ball at the contact-point of the next spoke.  Hence arises a series\r\nof silky atoms marking the course of the disappearing spiral.\r\n\r\nThe light has to fall favourably for us to perceive these specks, the\r\nonly remains of the ruined auxiliary thread.  One would take them for\r\ngrains of dust, if the faultless regularity of their distribution did not\r\nremind us of the vanished spiral.  They continue, still visible, until\r\nthe final collapse of the net.\r\n\r\nAnd the Spider, without a stop of any kind, turns and turns and turns,\r\ndrawing nearer to the centre and repeating the operation of fixing her\r\nthread at each spoke which she crosses.  A good half-hour, an hour even\r\namong the full-grown Spiders, is spent on spiral circles, to the number\r\nof about fifty for the web of the Silky Epeira and thirty for those of\r\nthe Banded and the Angular Epeira.\r\n\r\nAt last, at some distance from the centre, on the borders of what I have\r\ncalled the resting-floor, the Spider abruptly terminates her spiral when\r\nthe space would still allow of a certain number of turns.  We shall see\r\nthe reason of this sudden stop presently.  Next, the Epeira, no matter\r\nwhich, young or old, hurriedly flings herself upon the little central\r\ncushion, pulls it out and rolls it into a ball which I expected to see\r\nthrown away.  But no: her thrifty nature does not permit this waste.  She\r\neats the cushion, at first an inaugural landmark, then a heap of bits of\r\nthread; she once more melts in the digestive crucible what is no doubt\r\nintended to be restored to the silken treasury.  It is a tough mouthful,\r\ndifficult for the stomach to elaborate; still, it is precious and must\r\nnot be lost.  The work finishes with the swallowing.  Then and there, the\r\nSpider instals herself, head downwards, at her hunting-post in the centre\r\nof the web.\r\n\r\nThe operation which we have just seen gives rise to a reflection.  Men\r\nare born right-handed.  Thanks to a lack of symmetry that has never been\r\nexplained, our right side is stronger and readier in its movements than\r\nour left.  The inequality is especially noticeable in the two hands.  Our\r\nlanguage expresses this supremacy of the favoured side in the terms\r\ndexterity, adroitness and address, all of which allude to the right hand.\r\n\r\nIs the animal, on its side, right-handed, left-handed, or unbiased?  We\r\nhave had opportunities of showing that the Cricket, the Grasshopper and\r\nmany others draw their bow, which is on the right wing-case, over the\r\nsounding apparatus, which is on the left wing-case.  They are\r\nright-handed.\r\n\r\nWhen you and I take an unpremeditated turn, we spin round on our right\r\nheel.  The left side, the weaker, moves on the pivot of the right, the\r\nstronger.  In the same way, nearly all the Molluscs that have spiral\r\nshells roll their coils from left to right.  Among the numerous species\r\nin both land and water fauna, only a very few are exceptional and turn\r\nfrom right to left.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to try and work out to what extent that part of\r\nthe zoological kingdom which boasts a two-sided structure is divided into\r\nright-handed and left-handed animals.  Can dissymetry, that source of\r\ncontrasts, be a general rule?  Or are there neutrals, endowed with equal\r\npowers of skill and energy on both sides?  Yes, there are; and the Spider\r\nis one of them.  She enjoys the very enviable privilege of possessing a\r\nleft side which is no less capable than the right.  She is ambidextrous,\r\nas witness the following observations.\r\n\r\nWhen laying her snaring-thread, every Epeira turns in either direction\r\nindifferently, as a close watch will prove.  Reasons whose secret escapes\r\nus determine the direction adopted.  Once this or the other course is\r\ntaken, the spinstress does not change it, even after incidents that\r\nsometimes occur to disturb the progress of the work.  It may happen that\r\na Gnat gets caught in the part already woven.  The Spider thereupon\r\nabruptly interrupts her labours, hastens up to the prey, binds it and\r\nthen returns to where she stopped and continues the spiral in the same\r\norder as before.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the work, gyration in one direction being employed\r\nas well as gyration in the other, we see that, when making her repeated\r\nwebs, the same Epeira turns now her right side, now her left to the\r\ncentre of the coil.  Well, as we have said, it is always with the inner\r\nhind-leg, the leg nearer the centre, that is to say, in some cases the\r\nright and in some cases the left leg, that she places the thread in\r\nposition, an exceedingly delicate operation calling for the display of\r\nexquisite skill, because of the quickness of the action and the need for\r\npreserving strictly equal distances.  Any one seeing this leg working\r\nwith such extreme precision, the right leg to-day, the left to-morrow,\r\nbecomes convinced that the Epeira is highly ambidextrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X: THE GARDEN SPIDERS: MY NEIGHBOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nAge does not modify the Epeira's talent in any essential feature.  As the\r\nyoung worked, so do the old, the richer by a year's experience.  There\r\nare no masters nor apprentices in their guild; all know their craft from\r\nthe moment that the first thread is laid.  We have learnt something from\r\nthe novices: let us now look into the matter of their elders and see what\r\nadditional task the needs of age impose upon them.\r\n\r\nJuly comes and gives me exactly what I wish for.  While the new\r\ninhabitants are twisting their ropes on the rosemaries in the enclosure,\r\none evening, by the last gleams of twilight, I discover a splendid\r\nSpider, with a mighty belly, just outside my door.  This one is a matron;\r\nshe dates back to last year; her majestic corpulence, so exceptional at\r\nthis season, proclaims the fact.  I know her for the Angular Epeira\r\n(_Epeira angulata_, WALCK.), clad in grey and girdled with two dark\r\nstripes that meet in a point at the back.  The base of her abdomen swells\r\ninto a short nipple on either side.\r\n\r\nThis neighbour will certainly serve my turn, provided that she do not\r\nwork too late at night.  Things bode well: I catch the buxom one in the\r\nact of laying her first threads.  At this rate my success need not be won\r\nat the expense of sleep.  And, in fact, I am able, throughout the month\r\nof July and the greater part of August, from eight to ten o'clock in the\r\nevening, to watch the construction of the web, which is more or less\r\nruined nightly by the incidents of the chase and built up again, next\r\nday, when too seriously dilapidated.\r\n\r\nDuring the two stifling months, when the light fails and a spell of\r\ncoolness follows upon the furnace-heat of the day, it is easy for me,\r\nlantern in hand, to watch my neighbour's various operations.  She has\r\ntaken up her abode, at a convenient height for observation, between a row\r\nof cypress-trees and a clump of laurels, near the entrance to an alley\r\nhaunted by Moths.  The spot appears well-chosen, for the Epeira does not\r\nchange it throughout the season, though she renews her net almost every\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nPunctually as darkness falls, our whole family goes and calls upon her.\r\nBig and little, we stand amazed at her wealth of belly and her exuberant\r\nsomersaults in the maze of quivering ropes; we admire the faultless\r\ngeometry of the net as it gradually takes shape.  All agleam in the\r\nlantern-light, the work becomes a fairy orb, which seems woven of\r\nmoonbeams.\r\n\r\nShould I linger, in my anxiety to clear up certain details, the\r\nhousehold, which by this time is in bed, waits for my return before going\r\nto sleep:\r\n\r\n'What has she been doing this evening?' I am asked.  'Has she finished\r\nher web?  Has she caught a Moth?'\r\n\r\nI describe what has happened.  To-morrow, they will be in a less hurry to\r\ngo to bed: they will want to see everything, to the very end.  What\r\ndelightful, simple evenings we have spent looking into the Spider's\r\nworkshop!\r\n\r\nThe journal of the Angular Epeira, written up day by day, teaches us,\r\nfirst of all, how she obtains the ropes that form the framework of the\r\nbuilding.  All day invisible, crouching amid the cypress-leaves, the\r\nSpider, at about eight o'clock in the evening, solemnly emerges from her\r\nretreat and makes for the top of a branch.  In this exalted position, she\r\nsits for some time laying her plans with due regard to the locality; she\r\nconsults the weather, ascertains if the night will be fine.  Then,\r\nsuddenly, with her eight legs wide-spread, she lets herself drop straight\r\ndown, hanging to the line that issues from her spinnerets.  Just as the\r\nrope-maker obtains the even output of his hemp by walking backwards, so\r\ndoes the Epeira obtain the discharge of hers by falling.  It is extracted\r\nby the weight of her body.\r\n\r\nThe descent, however, has not the brute speed which the force of gravity\r\nwould give it, if uncontrolled.  It is governed by the action of the\r\nspinnerets, which contract or expand their pores, or close them entirely,\r\nat the faller's pleasure.  And so, with gentle moderation she pays out\r\nthis living plumb-line, of which my lantern clearly shows me the plumb,\r\nbut not always the line.  The great squab seems at such times to be\r\nsprawling in space, without the least support.\r\n\r\nShe comes to an abrupt stop two inches from the ground; the silk-reel\r\nceases working.  The Spider turns round, clutches the line which she has\r\njust obtained and climbs up by this road, still spinning.  But, this\r\ntime, as she is no longer assisted by the force of gravity, the thread is\r\nextracted in another manner.  The two hind-legs, with a quick alternate\r\naction, draw it from the wallet and let it go.\r\n\r\nOn returning to her starting-point, at a height of six feet or more, the\r\nSpider is now in possession of a double line, bent into a loop and\r\nfloating loosely in a current of air.  She fixes her end where it suits\r\nher and waits until the other end, wafted by the wind, has fastened its\r\nloop to the adjacent twigs.\r\n\r\nThe desired result may be very slow in coming.  It does not tire the\r\nunfailing patience of the Epeira, but it soon wears out mine.  And it has\r\nhappened to me sometimes to collaborate with the Spider.  I pick up the\r\nfloating loop with a straw and lay it on a branch, at a convenient\r\nheight.  The foot-bridge erected with my assistance is considered\r\nsatisfactory, just as though the wind had placed it.  I count this\r\ncollaboration among the good actions standing to my credit.\r\n\r\nFeeling her thread fixed, the Epeira runs along it repeatedly, from end\r\nto end, adding a fibre to it on each journey.  Whether I help or not,\r\nthis forms the 'suspension-cable,' the main piece of the framework.  I\r\ncall it a cable, in spite of its extreme thinness, because of its\r\nstructure.  It looks as though it were single, but, at the two ends, it\r\nis seen to divide and spread, tuft-wise, into numerous constituent parts,\r\nwhich are the product of as many crossings.  These diverging fibres, with\r\ntheir several contact-points, increase the steadiness of the two\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nThe suspension-cable is incomparably stronger than the rest of the work\r\nand lasts for an indefinite time.  The web is generally shattered after\r\nthe night's hunting and is nearly always rewoven on the following\r\nevening.  After the removal of the wreckage, it is made all over again,\r\non the same site, cleared of everything except the cable from which the\r\nnew network is to hang.\r\n\r\nThe laying of this cable is a somewhat difficult matter, because the\r\nsuccess of the enterprise does not depend upon the animal's industry\r\nalone.  It has to wait until a breeze carries the line to the pier-head\r\nin the bushes.  Sometimes, a calm prevails; sometimes, the thread catches\r\nat an unsuitable point.  This involves great expenditure of time, with no\r\ncertainty of success.  And so, when once the suspension-cable is in\r\nbeing, well and solidly placed, the Epeira does not change it, except on\r\ncritical occasions.  Every evening, she passes and repasses over it,\r\nstrengthening it with fresh threads.\r\n\r\nWhen the Epeira cannot manage a fall of sufficient depth to give her the\r\ndouble line with its loop to be fixed at a distance, she employs another\r\nmethod.  She lets herself down and then climbs up again, as we have\r\nalready seen; but, this time, the thread ends suddenly in a filmy hair-\r\npencil, a tuft, whose parts remain disjoined, just as they come from the\r\nspinneret's rose.  Then this sort of bushy fox's brush is cut short, as\r\nthough with a pair of scissors, and the whole thread, when unfurled,\r\ndoubles its length, which is now enough for the purpose.  It is fastened\r\nby the end joined to the Spider; the other floats in the air, with its\r\nspreading tuft, which easily tangles in the bushes.  Even so must the\r\nBanded Epeira go to work when she throws her daring suspension-bridge\r\nacross a stream.\r\n\r\nOnce the cable is laid, in this way or in that, the Spider is in\r\npossession of a base that allows her to approach or withdraw from the\r\nleafy piers at will.  From the height of the cable, the upper boundary of\r\nthe projected works, she lets herself slip to a slight depth, varying the\r\npoints of her fall.  She climbs up again by the line produced by her\r\ndescent.  The result of the operation is a double thread which is unwound\r\nwhile the Spider walks along her big foot-bridge to the contact-branch,\r\nwhere she fixes the free end of her thread more or less low down.  In\r\nthis way, she obtains, to right and left, a few slanting cross-bars,\r\nconnecting the cable with the branches.\r\n\r\nThese cross-bars, in their turn, support others in ever-changing\r\ndirections.  When there are enough of them, the Epeira need no longer\r\nresort to falls in order to extract her threads; she goes from one cord\r\nto the next, always wire-drawing with her hind-legs and placing her\r\nproduce in position as she goes.  This results in a combination of\r\nstraight lines owning no order, save that they are kept in one, nearly\r\nperpendicular plane.  They mark a very irregular polygonal area, wherein\r\nthe web, itself a work of magnificent regularity, shall presently be\r\nwoven.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to go over the construction of the masterpiece again;\r\nthe younger Spiders have taught us enough in this respect.  In both\r\ncases, we see the same equidistant radii laid, with a central landmark\r\nfor a guide; the same auxiliary spiral, the scaffolding of temporary\r\nrungs, soon doomed to disappear; the same snaring-spiral, with its maze\r\nof closely-woven coils.  Let us pass on: other details call for our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe laying of the snaring-spiral is an exceedingly delicate operation,\r\nbecause of the regularity of the work.  I was bent upon knowing whether,\r\nif subjected to the din of unaccustomed sounds, the Spider would hesitate\r\nand blunder.  Does she work imperturbably?  Or does she need undisturbed\r\nquiet?  As it is, I know that my presence and that of my light hardly\r\ntrouble her at all.  The sudden flashes emitted by my lantern have no\r\npower to distract her from her task.  She continues to turn in the light\r\neven as she turned in the dark, neither faster nor slower.  This is a\r\ngood omen for the experiment which I have in view.\r\n\r\nThe first Sunday in August is the feast of the patron saint of the\r\nvillage, commemorating the Finding of St. Stephen.  This is Tuesday, the\r\nthird day of the rejoicings.  There will be fireworks to-night, at nine\r\no'clock, to conclude the merry-makings.  They will take place on the high-\r\nroad outside my door, at a few steps from the spot where my Spider is\r\nworking.  The spinstress is busy upon her great spiral at the very moment\r\nwhen the village big-wigs arrive with trumpet and drum and small boys\r\ncarrying torches.\r\n\r\nMore interested in animal psychology than in pyrotechnical displays, I\r\nwatch the Epeira's doings, lantern in hand.  The hullabaloo of the crowd,\r\nthe reports of the mortars, the crackle of Roman candles bursting in the\r\nsky, the hiss of the rockets, the rain of sparks, the sudden flashes of\r\nwhite, red or blue light: none of this disturbs the worker, who\r\nmethodically turns and turns again, just as she does in the peace of\r\nordinary evenings.\r\n\r\nOnce before, the gun which I fired under the plane-trees failed to\r\ntrouble the concert of the Cicadae; to-day, the dazzling light of the\r\nfire-wheels and the splutter of the crackers do not avail to distract the\r\nSpider from her weaving.  And, after all, what difference would it make\r\nto my neighbour if the world fell in!  The village could be blown up with\r\ndynamite, without her losing her head for such a trifle.  She would\r\ncalmly go on with her web.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the Spider manufacturing her net under the usual\r\ntranquil conditions.  The great spiral has been finished, abruptly, on\r\nthe confines of the resting-floor.  The central cushion, a mat of ends of\r\nsaved thread, is next pulled up and eaten.  But, before indulging in this\r\nmouthful, which closes the proceedings, two Spiders, the only two of the\r\norder, the Banded and the Silky Epeira, have still to sign their work.  A\r\nbroad, white ribbon is laid, in a thick zigzag, from the centre to the\r\nlower edge of the orb.  Sometimes, but not always, a second band of the\r\nsame shape and of lesser length occupies the upper portion, opposite the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nI like to look upon these odd flourishes as consolidating-gear.  To begin\r\nwith, the young Epeirae never use them.  For the moment, heedless of the\r\nfuture and lavish of their silk, they remake their web nightly, even\r\nthough it be none too much dilapidated and might well serve again.  A\r\nbrand-new snare at sunset is the rule with them.  And there is little\r\nneed for increased solidity when the work has to be done again on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the late autumn, the full-grown Spiders, feeling\r\nlaying-time at hand, are driven to practise economy, in view of the great\r\nexpenditure of silk required for the egg-bag.  Owing to its large size,\r\nthe net now becomes a costly work which it were well to use as long as\r\npossible, for fear of finding one's reserves exhausted when the time\r\ncomes for the expensive construction of the nest.  For this reason, or\r\nfor others which escape me, the Banded and the Silky Epeirae think it\r\nwise to produce durable work and to strengthen their toils with a cross-\r\nribbon.  The other Epeirae, who are put to less expense in the\r\nfabrication of their maternal wallet--a mere pill--are unacquainted with\r\nthe zigzag binder and, like the younger Spiders, reconstruct their web\r\nalmost nightly.\r\n\r\nMy fat neighbour, the Angular Epeira, consulted by the light of a\r\nlantern, shall tell us how the renewal of the net proceeds.  As the\r\ntwilight fades, she comes down cautiously from her day-dwelling; she\r\nleaves the foliage of the cypresses for the suspension-cable of her\r\nsnare.  Here she stands for some time; then, descending to her web, she\r\ncollects the wreckage in great armfuls.  Everything--spiral, spokes and\r\nframe--is raked up with her legs.  One thing alone is spared and that is\r\nthe suspension-cable, the sturdy piece of work that has served as a\r\nfoundation for the previous buildings and will serve for the new after\r\nreceiving a few strengthening repairs.\r\n\r\nThe collected ruins form a pill which the Spider consumes with the same\r\ngreed that she would show in swallowing her prey.  Nothing remains.  This\r\nis the second instance of the Spiders' supreme economy of their silk.  We\r\nhave seen them, after the manufacture of the net, eating the central\r\nguide-post, a modest mouthful; we now see them gobbling up the whole web,\r\na meal.  Refined and turned into fluid by the stomach, the materials of\r\nthe old net will serve for other purposes.\r\n\r\nAs goon as the site is thoroughly cleared, the work of the frame and the\r\nnet begins on the support of the suspension-cable which was respected.\r\nWould it not be simpler to restore the old web, which might serve many\r\ntimes yet, if a few rents were just repaired?  One would say so; but does\r\nthe Spider know how to patch her work, as a thrifty housewife darns her\r\nlinen?  That is the question.\r\n\r\nTo mend severed meshes, to replace broken threads, to adjust the new to\r\nthe old, in short, to restore the original order by assembling the\r\nwreckage would be a far-reaching feat of prowess, a very fine proof of\r\ngleams of intelligence, capable of performing rational calculations.  Our\r\nmenders excel in this class of work.  They have as their guide their\r\nsense, which measures the holes, cuts the new piece to size and fits it\r\ninto its proper place.  Does the Spider possess the counterpart of this\r\nhabit of clear thinking?\r\n\r\nPeople declare as much, without, apparently, looking into the matter very\r\nclosely.  They seem able to dispense with the conscientious observer's\r\nscruples, when inflating their bladder of theory.  They go straight\r\nahead; and that is enough.  As for ourselves, less greatly daring, we\r\nwill first enquire; we will see by experiment if the Spider really knows\r\nhow to repair her work.\r\n\r\nThe Angular Epeira, that near neighbour who has already supplied me with\r\nso many documents, has just finished her web, at nine o'clock in the\r\nevening.  It is a splendid night, calm and warm, favourable to the rounds\r\nof the Moths.  All promises good hunting.  At the moment when, after\r\ncompleting the great spiral, the Epeira is about to eat the central\r\ncushion and settle down upon her resting-floor, I cut the web in two,\r\ndiagonally, with a pair of sharp scissors.  The sagging of the spokes,\r\ndeprived of their counter-agents, produces an empty space, wide enough\r\nfor three fingers to pass through.\r\n\r\nThe Spider retreats to her cable and looks on without being greatly\r\nfrightened.  When I have done, she quietly returns.  She takes her stand\r\non one of the halves, at the spot which was the centre of the original\r\norb; but, as her legs find no footing on one side, she soon realizes that\r\nthe snare is defective.  Thereupon, two threads are stretched across the\r\nbreach, two threads, no more; the legs that lacked a foothold spread\r\nacross them; and henceforth the Epeira moves no more, devoting her\r\nattention to the incidents of the chase.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw those two threads laid, joining the edges of the rent, I began\r\nto hope that I was to witness a mending-process:\r\n\r\n'The Spider,' said I to myself, 'will increase the number of those cross-\r\nthreads from end to end of the breach; and, though the added piece may\r\nnot match the rest of the work, at least it will fill the gap and the\r\ncontinuous sheet will be of the same use practically as the regular web.'\r\n\r\nThe reality did not answer to my expectation.  The spinstress made no\r\nfurther endeavour all night.  She hunted with her riven net, for what it\r\nwas worth; for I found the web next morning in the same condition wherein\r\nI had left it on the night before.  There had been no mending of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe two threads stretched across the breach even must not be taken for an\r\nattempt at repairing.  Finding no foothold for her legs on one side, the\r\nSpider went to look into the state of things and, in so doing, crossed\r\nthe rent.  In going and returning, she left a thread, as is the custom\r\nwith all the Epeirae when walking.  It was not a deliberate mending, but\r\nthe mere result of an uneasy change of place.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the subject of my experiment thought it unnecessary to go to\r\nfresh trouble and expense, for the web can serve quite well as it is,\r\nafter my scissor-cut: the two halves together represent the original\r\nsnaring-surface.  All that the Spider, seated in a central position, need\r\ndo is to find the requisite support for her spread legs.  The two threads\r\nstretched from side to side of the cleft supply her with this, or nearly.\r\nMy mischief did not go far enough.  Let us devise something better.\r\n\r\nNext day, the web is renewed, after the old one has been swallowed.  When\r\nthe work is done and the Epeira seated motionless at her central post, I\r\ntake a straw and, wielding it dexterously, so as to respect the resting-\r\nfloor and the spokes, I pull and root up the spiral, which dangles in\r\ntatters.  With its snaring-threads ruined, the net is useless; no passing\r\nMoth would allow herself to be caught.  Now what does the Epeira do in\r\nthe face of this disaster?  Nothing at all.  Motionless on her resting-\r\nfloor, which I have left intact, she awaits the capture of the game; she\r\nawaits it all night in vain on her impotent web.  In the morning, I find\r\nthe snare as I left it.  Necessity, the mother of invention, has not\r\nprompted the Spider to make a slight repair in her ruined toils.\r\n\r\nPossibly this is asking too much of her resources.  The silk-glands may\r\nbe exhausted after the laying of the great spiral; and to repeat the same\r\nexpenditure immediately is out of the question.  I want a case wherein\r\nthere could be no appeal to any such exhaustion.  I obtain it, thanks to\r\nmy assiduity.\r\n\r\nWhile I am watching the rolling of the spiral, a head of game rushes fun\r\ntilt into the unfinished snare.  The Epeira interrupts her work, hurries\r\nto the giddy-pate, swathes him and takes her fill of him where he lies.\r\nDuring the struggle, a section of the web has torn under the weaver's\r\nvery eyes.  A great gap endangers the satisfactory working of the net.\r\nWhat will the spider do in the presence of this grievous rent?\r\n\r\nNow or never is the time to repair the broken threads: the accident has\r\nhappened this very moment, between the animal's legs; it is certainly\r\nknown and, moreover, the rope-works are in full swing.  This time there\r\nis no question of the exhaustion of the silk-warehouse.\r\n\r\nWell, under these conditions, so favourable to darning, the Epeira does\r\nno mending at all.  She flings aside her prey, after taking a few sips at\r\nit, and resumes her spiral at the point where she interrupted it to\r\nattack the Moth.  The torn part remains as it is.  The machine-shuttle in\r\nour looms does not revert to the spoiled fabric; even so with the Spider\r\nworking at her web.\r\n\r\nAnd this is no case of distraction, of individual carelessness; all the\r\nlarge spinstresses suffer from a similar incapacity for patching.  The\r\nBanded Epeira and the Silky Epeira are noteworthy in this respect.  The\r\nAngular Epeira remakes her web nearly every evening; the other two\r\nreconstruct theirs only very seldom and use them even when extremely\r\ndilapidated.  They go on hunting with shapeless rags.  Before they bring\r\nthemselves to weave a new web, the old one has to be ruined beyond\r\nrecognition.  Well, I have often noted the state of one of these ruins\r\nand, the next morning, I have found it as it was, or even more\r\ndilapidated.  Never any repairs; never; never.  I am sorry, because of\r\nthe reputation which our hard-pressed theorists have given her, but the\r\nSpider is absolutely unable to mend her work.  In spite of her thoughtful\r\nappearance, the Epeira is incapable of the modicum of reflexion required\r\nto insert a piece into an accidental gap.\r\n\r\nOther Spiders are unacquainted with wide-meshed nets and weave satins\r\nwherein the threads, crossing at random, form a continuous substance.\r\nAmong this number is the House Spider (_Tegenaria domestica_, LIN.).  In\r\nthe corners of our rooms, she stretches wide webs fixed by angular\r\nextensions.  The best-protected nook at one side contains the owner's\r\nsecret apartment.  It is a silk tube, a gallery with a conical opening,\r\nwhence the Spider, sheltered from the eye, watches events.  The rest of\r\nthe fabric, which exceeds our finest muslins in delicacy, is not,\r\nproperly speaking, a hunting-implement: it is a platform whereon the\r\nSpider, attending to the affairs of her estate, goes her rounds,\r\nespecially at night.  The real trap consists of a confusion of lines\r\nstretched above the web.\r\n\r\nThe snare, constructed according to other rules than in the case of the\r\nEpeirae, also works differently.  Here are no viscous threads, but plain\r\ntoils, rendered invisible by the very number.  If a Gnat rush into the\r\nperfidious entanglement, he is caught at once; and the more he struggles\r\nthe more firmly is he bound.  The snareling falls on the sheet-web.\r\n_Tegenaria_ hastens up and bites him in the neck.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, let us experiment a little.  In the web of the House\r\nSpider, I make a round hole, two fingers wide.  The hole remains yawning\r\nall day long; but next morning it is invariably closed.  An extremely\r\nthin gauze covers the breach, the dark appearance of which contrasts with\r\nthe dense whiteness of the surrounding fabric.  The gauze is so delicate\r\nthat, to make sure of its presence, I use a straw rather than my eyes.\r\nThe movement of the web, when this part is touched, proves the presence\r\nof an obstacle.\r\n\r\nHere, the matter would appear obvious.  The House Spider has mended her\r\nwork during the night; she has put a patch in the torn stuff, a talent\r\nunknown to the Garden Spiders.  It would be greatly to her credit, if a\r\nmere attentive study did not lead to another conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe web of the House Spider is, as we were saying, a platform for\r\nwatching and exploring; it is also a sheet into which the insects caught\r\nin the overhead rigging fall.  This surface, a domain subject to\r\nunlimited shocks, is never strong enough, especially as it is exposed to\r\nthe additional burden of little bits of plaster loosened from the wall.\r\nThe owner is constantly working at it; she adds a new layer nightly.\r\n\r\nEvery time that she issues from her tubular retreat or returns to it, she\r\nfixes the thread that hangs behind her upon the road covered.  As\r\nevidence of this work, we have the direction of the surface-lines, all of\r\nwhich, whether straight or winding, according to the fancies that guide\r\nthe Spider's path, converge upon the entrance of the tube.  Each step\r\ntaken, beyond a doubt, adds a filament to the web.\r\n\r\nWe have here the story of the Processionary of the Pine, {30} whose\r\nhabits I have related elsewhere.  When the caterpillars leave the silk\r\npouch, to go and browse at night, and also when they enter it again, they\r\nnever fail to spin a little on the surface of their nest.  Each\r\nexpedition adds to the thickness of the wall.\r\n\r\nWhen moving this way or that upon the purse which I have split from top\r\nto bottom with my scissors, the Processionaries upholster the breach even\r\nas they upholster the untouched part, without paying more attention to it\r\nthan to the rest of the wall.  Caring nothing about the accident, they\r\nbehave in the same way as on a non-gutted dwelling.  The crevice is\r\nclosed, in course of time, not intentionally, but solely by the action of\r\nthe usual spinning.\r\n\r\nWe arrive at the same conclusion on the subject of the House Spider.\r\nWalking about her platform every night, she lays fresh courses without\r\ndrawing a distinction between the solid and the hollow.  She has not\r\ndeliberately put a patch in the torn texture; she has simply gone on with\r\nher ordinary business.  If it happen that the hole is eventually closed,\r\nthis fortunate result is the outcome not of a special purpose, but of an\r\nunvarying method of work.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is evident that, if the Spider really wished to mend her web,\r\nall her endeavours would be concentrated upon the rent.  She would devote\r\nto it all the silk at her disposal and obtain in one sitting a piece very\r\nlike the rest of the web.  Instead of that, what do we find?  Almost\r\nnothing: a hardly visible gauze.\r\n\r\nThe thing is obvious: the Spider did on that rent what she did every\r\nelsewhere, neither more nor less.  Far from squandering silk upon it, she\r\nsaved her silk so as to have enough for the whole web.  The gap will be\r\nbetter mended, little by little, afterwards, as the sheet is strengthened\r\nall over with new layers.  And this will take long.  Two months later,\r\nthe window--my work--still shows through and makes a dark stain against\r\nthe dead-white of the fabric.\r\n\r\nNeither weavers nor spinners, therefore, know how to repair their work.\r\nThose wonderful manufacturers of silk-stuffs lack the least glimmer of\r\nthat sacred lamp, reason, which enables the stupidest of darning-women to\r\nmend the heel of an old stocking.  The office of inspector of Spiders'\r\nwebs would have its uses, even if it merely succeeded in ridding us of a\r\nmistaken and mischievous idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI: THE GARDEN SPIDERS: THE LIME-SNARE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spiral network of the Epeirae possesses contrivances of fearsome\r\ncunning.  Let us give our attention by preference to that of the Banded\r\nEpeira or that of the Silky Epeira, both of which can be observed at\r\nearly morning in all their freshness.\r\n\r\nThe thread that forms them is seen with the naked eye to differ from that\r\nof the framework and the spokes.  It glitters in the sun, looks as though\r\nit were knotted and gives the impression of a chaplet of atoms.  To\r\nexamine it through the lens on the web itself is scarcely feasible,\r\nbecause of the shaking of the fabric, which trembles at the least breath.\r\nBy passing a sheet of glass under the web and lifting it, I take away a\r\nfew pieces of thread to study, pieces that remain fixed to the glass in\r\nparallel lines.  Lens and microscope can now play their part.\r\n\r\nThe sight is perfectly astounding.  Those threads, on the borderland\r\nbetween the visible and the invisible, are very closely twisted twine,\r\nsimilar to the gold cord of our officers' sword-knots.  Moreover, they\r\nare hollow.  The infinitely slender is a tube, a channel full of a\r\nviscous moisture resembling a strong solution of gum arabic.  I can see a\r\ndiaphanous trail of this moisture trickling through the broken ends.\r\nUnder the pressure of the thin glass slide that covers them on the stage\r\nof the microscope, the twists lengthen out, become crinkled ribbons,\r\ntraversed from end to end, through the middle, by a dark streak, which is\r\nthe empty container.\r\n\r\nThe fluid contents must ooze slowly through the side of those tubular\r\nthreads, rolled into twisted strings, and thus render the network sticky.\r\nIt is sticky, in fact, and in such a way as to provoke surprise.  I bring\r\na fine straw flat down upon three or four rungs of a sector.  However\r\ngentle the contact, adhesion is at once established.  When I lift the\r\nstraw, the threads come with it and stretch to twice or three times their\r\nlength, like a thread of India-rubber.  At last, when over-taut, they\r\nloosen without breaking and resume their original form.  They lengthen by\r\nunrolling their twist, they shorten by rolling it again; lastly, they\r\nbecome adhesive by taking the glaze of the gummy moisture wherewith they\r\nare filled.\r\n\r\nIn short, the spiral thread is a capillary tube finer than any that our\r\nphysics will ever know.  It is rolled into a twist so as to possess an\r\nelasticity that allows it, without breaking, to yield to the tugs of the\r\ncaptured prey; it holds a supply of sticky matter in reserve in its tube,\r\nso as to renew the adhesive properties of the surface by incessant\r\nexudation, as they become impaired by exposure to the air.  It is simply\r\nmarvellous.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira hunts not with springs, but with lime-snares.  And such lime-\r\nsnares!  Everything is caught in them, down to the dandelion-plume that\r\nbarely brushes against them.  Nevertheless, the Epeira, who is in\r\nconstant touch with her web, is not caught in them.  Why?\r\n\r\nLet us first of all remember that the Spider has contrived for herself,\r\nin the middle of her trap, a floor in whose construction the sticky\r\nspiral thread plays no part.  We saw how this thread stops suddenly at\r\nsome distance from the centre.  There is here, covering a space which, in\r\nthe larger webs, is about equal to the palm of one's hand, a fabric\r\nformed of spokes and of the commencement of the auxiliary spiral, a\r\nneutral fabric in which the exploring straw finds no adhesiveness\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nHere, on this central resting-floor, and here only, the Epeira takes her\r\nstand, waiting whole days for the arrival of the game.  However close,\r\nhowever prolonged her contact with this portion of the web, she runs no\r\nrisk of sticking to it, because the gummy coating is lacking, as is the\r\ntwisted and tubular structure, throughout the length of the spokes and\r\nthroughout the extent of the auxiliary spiral.  These pieces, together\r\nwith the rest of the framework, are made of plain, straight, solid\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nBut, when a victim is caught, sometimes right at the edge of the web, the\r\nSpider has to rush up quickly, to bind it and overcome its attempts to\r\nfree itself.  She is walking then upon her network; and I do not find\r\nthat she suffers the least inconvenience.  The lime-threads are not even\r\nlifted by the movements of her legs.\r\n\r\nIn my boyhood, when a troop of us would go, on Thursdays, {31} to try and\r\ncatch a Goldfinch in the hemp-fields, we used, before covering the twigs\r\nwith glue, to grease our fingers with a few drops of oil, lest we should\r\nget them caught in the sticky matter.  Does the Epeira know the secret of\r\nfatty substances?  Let us try.\r\n\r\nI rub my exploring straw with slightly oiled paper.  When applied to the\r\nspiral thread of the web, it now no longer sticks to it.  The principle\r\nis discovered.  I pull out the leg of a live Epeira.  Brought just as it\r\nis into contact with the lime-threads, it does not stick to them any more\r\nthan to the neutral cords, whether spokes or parts of the framework.  We\r\nwere entitled to expect this, judging by the Spider's general immunity.\r\n\r\nBut here is something that wholly alters the result.  I put the leg to\r\nsoak for a quarter of an hour in disulphide of carbon, the best solvent\r\nof fatty matters.  I wash it carefully with a brush dipped in the same\r\nfluid.  When this washing is finished, the leg sticks to the\r\nsnaring-thread quite easily and adheres to it just as well as anything\r\nelse would, the unoiled straw, for instance.\r\n\r\nDid I guess aright when I judged that it was a fatty substance that\r\npreserved the Epeira from the snares of her sticky Catherine-wheel?  The\r\naction of the carbon disulphide seems to say yes.  Besides, there is no\r\nreason why a substance of this kind, which plays so frequent a part in\r\nanimal economy, should not coat the Spider very slightly by the mere act\r\nof perspiration.  We used to rub our fingers with a little oil before\r\nhandling the twigs in which the Goldfinch was to be caught; even so the\r\nEpeira varnishes herself with a special sweat, to operate on any part of\r\nher web without fear of the lime-threads.\r\n\r\nHowever, an unduly protracted stay on the sticky threads would have its\r\ndrawbacks.  In the long run, continual contact with those threads might\r\nproduce a certain adhesion and inconvenience the Spider, who must\r\npreserve all her agility in order to rush upon the prey before it can\r\nrelease itself.  For this reason, gummy threads are never used in\r\nbuilding the post of interminable waiting.\r\n\r\nIt is only on her resting-floor that the Epeira sits, motionless and with\r\nher eight legs outspread, ready to mark the least quiver in the net.  It\r\nis here, again, that she takes her meals, often long-drawn-out, when the\r\njoint is a substantial one; it is hither that, after trussing and\r\nnibbling it, she drags her prey at the end of a thread, to consume it at\r\nher ease on a non-viscous mat.  As a hunting-post and refectory, the\r\nEpeira has contrived a central space, free from glue.\r\n\r\nAs for the glue itself, it is hardly possible to study its chemical\r\nproperties, because the quantity is so slight.  The microscope shows it\r\ntrickling from the broken threads in the form of a transparent and more\r\nor less granular streak.  The following experiment will tell us more\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nWith a sheet of glass passed across the web, I gather a series of lime-\r\nthreads which remain fixed in parallel lines.  I cover this sheet with a\r\nbell-jar standing in a depth of water.  Soon, in this atmosphere\r\nsaturated with humidity, the threads become enveloped in a watery sheath,\r\nwhich gradually increases and begins to flow.  The twisted shape has by\r\nthis time disappeared; and the channel of the thread reveals a chaplet of\r\ntranslucent orbs, that is to say, a series of extremely fine drops.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-four hours, the threads have lost their contents and are\r\nreduced to almost invisible streaks.  If I then lay a drop of water on\r\nthe glass, I get a sticky solution, similar to that which a particle of\r\ngum arabic might yield.  The conclusion is evident: the Epeira's glue is\r\na substance that absorbs moisture freely.  In an atmosphere with a high\r\ndegree of humidity, it becomes saturated and percolates by sweating\r\nthrough the side of the tubular threads.\r\n\r\nThese data explain certain facts relating to the work of the net.  The\r\nfull-grown Banded and Silky Epeirae weave at very early hours, long\r\nbefore dawn.  Should the air turn misty, they sometimes leave that part\r\nof the task unfinished: they build the general framework, they lay the\r\nspokes, they even draw the auxiliary spiral, for all these parts are\r\nunaffected by excess of moisture; but they are very careful not to work\r\nat the lime-threads, which, if soaked by the fog, would dissolve into\r\nsticky shreds and lose their efficacy by being wetted.  The net that was\r\nstarted will be finished to-morrow, if the atmosphere be favourable.\r\n\r\nWhile the highly-absorbent character of the snaring-thread has its\r\ndrawbacks, it also has compensating advantages.  Both Epeirae, when\r\nhunting by day, affect those hot places, exposed to the fierce rays of\r\nthe sun, wherein the Crickets delight.  In the torrid heats of the dog-\r\ndays, therefore, the lime-threads, but for special provisions, would be\r\nliable to dry up, to shrivel into stiff and lifeless filaments.  But the\r\nvery opposite happens.  At the most scorching times of the day, they\r\ncontinue supple, elastic and more and more adhesive.\r\n\r\nHow is this brought about?  By their very powers of absorption.  The\r\nmoisture of which the air is never deprived penetrates them slowly; it\r\ndilutes the thick contents of their tubes to the requisite degree and\r\ncauses it to ooze through, as and when the earlier stickiness decreases.\r\nWhat bird-catcher could vie with the Garden Spider in the art of laying\r\nlime-snares?  And all this industry and cunning for the capture of a\r\nMoth!\r\n\r\nThen, too, what a passion for production!  Knowing the diameter of the\r\norb and the number of coils, we can easily calculate the total length of\r\nthe sticky spiral.  We find that, in one sitting, each time that she\r\nremakes her web, the Angular Epeira produces some twenty yards of gummy\r\nthread.  The more skilful Silky Epeira produces thirty.  Well, during two\r\nmonths, the Angular Epeira, my neighbour, renewed her snare nearly every\r\nevening.  During that period, she manufactured something like\r\nthree-quarters of a mile of this tubular thread, rolled into a tight\r\ntwist and bulging with glue.\r\n\r\nI should like an anatomist endowed with better implements than mine and\r\nwith less tired eyesight to explain to us the work of the marvellous rope-\r\nyard.  How is the silky matter moulded into a capillary tube?  How is\r\nthis tube filled with glue and tightly twisted?  And how does this same\r\nwire-mill also turn out plain threads, wrought first into a framework and\r\nthen into muslin and satin; next, a russet foam, such as fills the wallet\r\nof the Banded Epeira; next, the black stripes stretched in meridian\r\ncurves on that same wallet?  What a number of products to come from that\r\ncurious factory, a Spider's belly!  I behold the results, but fail to\r\nunderstand the working of the machine.  I leave the problem to the\r\nmasters of the microtome and the scalpel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII: THE GARDEN SPIDERS: THE TELEGRAPH-WIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the six Garden Spiders that form the object of my observations, two\r\nonly, the Banded and the silky Epeira, remain constantly in their webs,\r\neven under the blinding rays of a fierce sun.  The others, as a rule, do\r\nnot show themselves until nightfall.  At some distance from the net, they\r\nhave a rough and ready retreat in the brambles, an ambush made of a few\r\nleaves held together by stretched threads.  It is here that, for the most\r\npart, they remain in the daytime, motionless and sunk in meditation.\r\n\r\nBut the shrill light that vexes them is the joy of the fields.  At such\r\ntimes, the Locust hops more nimbly than ever, more gaily skims the Dragon-\r\nfly.  Besides, the limy web, despite the rents suffered during the night,\r\nis still in serviceable condition.  If some giddy-pate allow himself to\r\nbe caught, will the Spider, at the distance whereto she has retired, be\r\nunable to take advantage of the windfall?  Never fear.  She arrives in a\r\nflash.  How is she apprised?  Let us explain the matter.\r\n\r\nThe alarm is given by the vibration of the web, much more than by the\r\nsight of the captured object.  A very simple experiment will prove this.\r\nI lay upon a Banded Epeira's lime-threads a Locust that second\r\nasphyxiated with carbon disulphide.  The carcass is placed in front, or\r\nbehind, or at either side of the Spider, who sits moveless in the centre\r\nof the net.  If the test is to be applied to a species with a daytime\r\nhiding-place amid the foliage, the dead Locust is laid on the web, more\r\nor less near the centre, no matter how.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, nothing happens at first.  The Epeira remains in her\r\nmotionless attitude, even when the morsel is at a short distance in front\r\nof her.  She is indifferent to the presence of the game, does not seem to\r\nperceive it, so much so that she ends by wearing out my patience.  Then,\r\nwith a long straw, which enables me to conceal myself slightly, I set the\r\ndead insect trembling.\r\n\r\nThat is quite enough.  The Banded Epeira and the Silky Epeira hasten to\r\nthe central floor; the others come down from the branch; all go to the\r\nLocust, swathe him with tape, treat him, in short, as they would treat a\r\nlive prey captured under normal conditions.  It took the shaking of the\r\nweb to decide them to attack.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the grey colour of the Locust is not sufficiently conspicuous to\r\nattract attention by itself.  Then let us try red, the brightest colour\r\nto our retina and probably also to the Spiders'.  None of the game hunted\r\nby the Epeirae being clad in scarlet, I make a small bundle out of red\r\nwool, a bait of the size of a Locust.  I glue it to the web.\r\n\r\nMy stratagem succeeds.  As long as the parcel is stationary, the Spider\r\nis not roused; but, the moment it trembles, stirred by my straw, she runs\r\nup eagerly.\r\n\r\nThere are silly ones who just touch the thing with their legs and,\r\nwithout further enquiries, swathe it in silk after the manner of the\r\nusual game.  They even go so far as to dig their fangs into the bait,\r\nfollowing the rule of the preliminary poisoning.  Then and then only the\r\nmistake is recognized and the tricked Spider retires and does not come\r\nback, unless it be long afterwards, when she flings the cumbersome object\r\nout of the web.\r\n\r\nThere are also clever ones.  Like the others, these hasten to the red-\r\nwoollen lure, which my straw insidiously keeps moving; they come from\r\ntheir tent among the leaves as readily as from the centre of the web;\r\nthey explore it with their palpi and their legs; but, soon perceiving\r\nthat the thing is valueless, they are careful not to spend their silk on\r\nuseless bonds.  My quivering bait does not deceive them.  It is flung out\r\nafter a brief inspection.\r\n\r\nStill, the clever ones, like the silly ones, run even from a distance,\r\nfrom their leafy ambush.  How do they know?  Certainly not by sight.\r\nBefore recognizing their mistake, they have to hold the object between\r\ntheir legs and even to nibble at it a little.  They are extremely short-\r\nsighted.  At a hand's-breadth's distance, the lifeless prey, unable to\r\nshake the web, remains unperceived.  Besides, in many cases, the hunting\r\ntakes place in the dense darkness of the night, when sight, even if it\r\nwere good, would not avail.\r\n\r\nIf the eyes are insufficient guides, even close at hand, how will it be\r\nwhen the prey has to be spied from afar! In that case, an intelligence-\r\napparatus for long-distance work becomes indispensable.  We have no\r\ndifficulty in detecting the apparatus.\r\n\r\nLet us look attentively behind the web of any Epeira with a daytime\r\nhiding-place: we shall see a thread that starts from the centre of the\r\nnetwork, ascends in a slanting line outside the plane of the web and ends\r\nat the ambush where the Spider lurks all day.  Except at the central\r\npoint, there is no connection between this thread and the rest of the\r\nwork, no interweaving with the scaffolding-threads.  Free of impediment,\r\nthe line runs straight from the centre of the net to the ambush-tent.  Its\r\nlength averages twenty-two inches.  The Angular Epeira, settled high up\r\nin the trees, has shown me some as long as eight or nine feet.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this slanting line is a foot-bridge which allows\r\nthe Spider to repair hurriedly to the web, when summoned by urgent\r\nbusiness, and then, when her round is finished, to return to her hut.  In\r\nfact, it is the road which I see her follow, in going and coming.  But is\r\nthat all?  No; for, if the Epeira had no aim in view but a means of rapid\r\ntransit between her tent and the net, the foot-bridge would be fastened\r\nto the upper edge of the web.  The journey would be shorter and the slope\r\nless steep.\r\n\r\nWhy, moreover, does this line always start in the centre of the sticky\r\nnetwork and nowhere else?  Because that is the point where the spokes\r\nmeet and, therefore, the common centre of vibration.  Anything that moves\r\nupon the web sets it shaking.  All then that is needed is a thread\r\nissuing from this central point to convey to a distance the news of a\r\nprey struggling in some part or other of the net.  The slanting cord,\r\nextending outside the plane of the web, is more than a foot-bridge: it\r\nis, above all, a signalling-apparatus, a telegraph-wire.\r\n\r\nLet us try experiment.  I place a Locust on the network.  Caught in the\r\nsticky toils, he plunges about.  Forthwith, the Spider issues impetuously\r\nfrom her hut, comes down the foot-bridge, makes a rush for the Locust,\r\nwraps him up and operates on him according to rule.  Soon after, she\r\nhoists him, fastened by a line to her spinneret, and drags him to her\r\nhiding-place, where a long banquet will be held.  So far, nothing new:\r\nthings happen as usual.\r\n\r\nI leave the Spider to mind her own affairs for some days, before I\r\ninterfere with her.  I again propose to give her a Locust; but, this\r\ntime, I first cut the signalling-thread with a touch of the scissors,\r\nwithout shaking any part of the edifice.  The game is then laid on the\r\nweb.  Complete success: the entangled insect struggles, sets the net\r\nquivering; the Spider, on her side, does not stir, as though heedless of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe idea might occur to one that, in this business, the Epeira stays\r\nmotionless in her cabin since she is prevented from hurrying down,\r\nbecause the foot-bridge is broken.  Let us undeceive ourselves: for one\r\nroad open to her there are a hundred, all ready to bring her to the place\r\nwhere her presence is now required.  The network is fastened to the\r\nbranches by a host of lines, all of them very easy to cross.  Well, the\r\nEpeira embarks upon none of them, but remains moveless and self-absorbed.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Because her telegraph, being out of order, no longer tells her of\r\nthe shaking of the web.  The captured prey is too far off for her to see\r\nit; she is all unwitting.  A good hour passes, with the Locust still\r\nkicking, the Spider impassive, myself watching.  Nevertheless, in the\r\nend, the Epeira wakes up: no longer feeling the signalling-thread, broken\r\nby my scissors, as taut as usual under her legs, she comes to look into\r\nthe state of things.  The web is reached, without the least difficulty,\r\nby one of the lines of the framework, the first that offers.  The Locust\r\nis then perceived and forthwith enswathed, after which the signalling-\r\nthread is remade, taking the place of the one which I have broken.  Along\r\nthis road the Spider goes home, dragging her prey behind her.\r\n\r\nMy neighbour, the mighty Angular Epeira, with her telegraph-wire nine\r\nfeet long, has even better things in store for me.  One morning, I find\r\nher web, which is now deserted, almost intact, a proof that the night's\r\nhunting has not been good.  The animal must be hungry.  With a piece of\r\ngame for a bait, I hope to bring her down from her lofty retreat.\r\n\r\nI entangle in the web a rare morsel, a Dragon-fly, who struggles\r\ndesperately and sets the whole net a-shaking.  The other, up above,\r\nleaves her lurking-place amid the cypress-foliage, strides swiftly down\r\nalong her telegraph-wire, comes to the Dragon-fly, trusses her and at\r\nonce climbs home again by the same road, with her prize dangling at her\r\nheels by a thread.  The final sacrifice will take place in the quiet of\r\nthe leafy sanctuary.\r\n\r\nA few days later, I renew my experiment under the same conditions, but,\r\nthis time, I first cut the signalling-thread.  In vain I select a large\r\nDragon-fly, a very restless prisoner; in vain I exert my patience: the\r\nSpider does not come down all day.  Her telegraph being broken, she\r\nreceives no notice of what is happening nine feet below.  The entangled\r\nmorsel remains where it lies, not despised, but unknown.  At nightfall,\r\nthe Epeira leaves her cabin, passes over the ruins of her web, finds the\r\nDragon-fly and eats her on the spot, after which the net is renewed.\r\n\r\nOne of the Epeirae whom I have had the opportunity of examining\r\nsimplifies the system, while retaining the essential mechanism of a\r\ntransmission-thread.  This is the Crater Epeira (_Epeira cratera_,\r\nWALCK.), a species seen in spring, at which time she indulges especially\r\nin the chase of the Domestic Bee, upon the flowering rosemaries.  At the\r\nleafy end of a branch, she builds a sort of silken shell, the shape and\r\nsize of an acorn-cup.  This is where she sits, with her paunch contained\r\nin the round cavity and her forelegs resting on the ledge, ready to leap.\r\nThe lazy creature loves this position and rarely stations herself head\r\ndownwards on the web, as do the others.  Cosily ensconced in the hollow\r\nof her cup, she awaits the approaching game.\r\n\r\nHer web, which is vertical, as is the rule among the Epeirae, is of a\r\nfair size and always very near the bowl wherein the Spider takes her\r\nease.  Moreover, it touches the bowl by means of an angular extension;\r\nand the angle always contains one spoke which the Epeira, seated, so to\r\nspeak, in her crater, has constantly under her legs.  This spoke,\r\nspringing from the common focus of the vibrations from all parts of the\r\nnetwork, is eminently fitted to keep the Spider informed of whatsoever\r\nhappens.  It has a double office: it forms part of the Catherine-wheel\r\nsupporting the lime-threads and it warns the Epeira by its vibrations.  A\r\nspecial thread is here superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe other snarers, on the contrary, who occupy a distant retreat by day,\r\ncannot do without a private wire that keeps them in permanent\r\ncommunication with the deserted web.  All of them have one, in point of\r\nfact, but only when age comes, age prone to rest and to long slumbers.  In\r\ntheir youth, the Epeirae, who are then very wide-awake, know nothing of\r\nthe art of telegraphy.  Besides, their web, a short-lived work whereof\r\nhardly a trace remains on the morrow, does not allow of this kind of\r\nindustry.  It is no use going to the expense of a signalling-apparatus\r\nfor a ruined snare wherein nothing can now be caught.  Only the old\r\nSpiders, meditating or dozing in their green tent, are warned from afar,\r\nby telegraph, of what takes place on the web.\r\n\r\nTo save herself from keeping a close watch that would degenerate into\r\ndrudgery and to remain alive to events even when resting, with her back\r\nturned on the net, the ambushed Spider always has her foot upon the\r\ntelegraph-wire.  Of my observations on this subject, let me relate the\r\nfollowing, which will be sufficient for our purpose.\r\n\r\nAn Angular Epeira, with a remarkably fine belly, has spun her web between\r\ntwo laurestine-shrubs, covering a width of nearly a yard.  The sun beats\r\nupon the snare, which is abandoned long before dawn.  The Spider is in\r\nher day manor, a resort easily discovered by following the\r\ntelegraph-wire.  It is a vaulted chamber of dead leaves, joined together\r\nwith a few bits of silk.  The refuge is deep: the Spider disappears in it\r\nentirely, all but her rounded hind-quarters, which bar the entrance to\r\nthe donjon.\r\n\r\nWith her front half plunged into the back of her hut, the Epeira\r\ncertainly cannot see her web.  Even if she had good sight, instead of\r\nbeing purblind, her position could not possibly allow her to keep the\r\nprey in view.  Does she give up hunting during this period, of bright\r\nsunlight?  Not at all.  Look again.\r\n\r\nWonderful!  One of her hind-legs is stretched outside the leafy cabin;\r\nand the signalling-thread ends just at the tip of that leg.  Whoso has\r\nnot seen the Epeira in this attitude, with her hand, so to speak, on the\r\ntelegraph-receiver, knows nothing of one of the most curious instances of\r\nanimal cleverness.  Let any game appear upon the scene; and the\r\nslumberer, forthwith aroused by means of the leg receiving the\r\nvibrations, hastens up.  A Locust whom I myself lay on the web procures\r\nher this agreeable shock and what follows.  If she is satisfied with her\r\nbag, I am still more satisfied with what I have learnt.\r\n\r\nThe occasion is too good not to find out, under better conditions as\r\nregards approach, what the inhabitant of the cypress-trees has already\r\nshown me.  The next morning, I cut the telegraph-wire, this time as long\r\nas one's arm and held, like yesterday, by one of the hind-legs stretched\r\noutside the cabin.  I then place on the web a double prey, a Dragon-fly\r\nand a Locust.  The latter kicks out with his long, spurred shanks; the\r\nother flutters her wings.  The web is tossed about to such an extent that\r\na number of leaves, just beside the Epeira's nest, move, shaken by the\r\nthreads of the framework affixed to them.\r\n\r\nAnd this vibration, though so close at hand, does not rouse the Spider in\r\nthe least, does not make her even turn round to enquire what is going on.\r\nThe moment that her signalling-thread ceases to work, she knows nothing\r\nof passing events.  All day long, she remains without stirring.  In the\r\nevening, at eight o'clock, she sallies forth to weave the new web and at\r\nlast finds the rich windfall whereof she was hitherto unaware.\r\n\r\nOne word more.  The web is often shaken by the wind.  The different parts\r\nof the framework, tossed and teased by the eddying air-currents, cannot\r\nfail to transmit their vibration to the signalling-thread.  Nevertheless,\r\nthe Spider does not quit her hut and remains indifferent to the commotion\r\nprevailing in the net.  Her line, therefore, is something better than a\r\nbell-rope that pulls and communicates the impulse given: it is a\r\ntelephone capable, like our own, of transmitting infinitesimal waves of\r\nsound.  Clutching her telephone-wire with a toe, the Spider listens with\r\nher leg; she perceives the innermost vibrations; she distinguishes\r\nbetween the vibration proceeding from a prisoner and the mere shaking\r\ncaused by the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII: THE GARDEN SPIDERS: PAIRING AND HUNTING\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the importance of the subject, I shall not enlarge upon\r\nthe nuptials of the Epeirae, grim natures whose loves easily turn to\r\ntragedy in the mystery of the night.  I have but once been present at the\r\npairing and for this curious experience I must thank my lucky star and my\r\nfat neighbour, the Angular Epeira, whom I visit so often by\r\nlantern-light.  Here you have it.\r\n\r\nIt is the first week of August, at about nine o'clock in the evening,\r\nunder a perfect sky, in calm, hot weather.  The Spider has not yet\r\nconstructed her web and is sitting motionless on her suspension-cable.\r\nThe fact that she should be slacking like this, at a time when her\r\nbuilding-operations ought to be in full swing, naturally astonishes me.\r\nCan something unusual be afoot?\r\n\r\nEven so.  I see hastening up from the neighbouring bushes and embarking\r\non the cable a male, a dwarf, who is coming, the whipper-snapper, to pay\r\nhis respects to the portly giantess.  How has he, in his distant corner,\r\nheard of the presence of the nymph ripe for marriage?  Among the Spiders,\r\nthese things are learnt in the silence of the night, without a summons,\r\nwithout a signal, none knows how.\r\n\r\nOnce, the Great Peacock, {32} apprised by the magic effluvia, used to\r\ncome from miles around to visit the recluse in her bell-jar in my study.\r\nThe dwarf of this evening, that other nocturnal pilgrim, crosses the\r\nintricate tangle of the branches without a mistake and makes straight for\r\nthe rope-walker.  He has as his guide the infallible compass that brings\r\nevery Jack and his Jill together.\r\n\r\nHe climbs the slope of the suspension-cord; he advances circumspectly,\r\nstep by step.  He stops some distance away, irresolute.  Shall he go\r\ncloser?  Is this the right moment?  No.  The other lifts a limb and the\r\nscared visitor hurries down again.  Recovering from his fright, he climbs\r\nup once more, draws a little nearer.  More sudden flights, followed by\r\nfresh approaches, each time nigher than before.  This restless running to\r\nand fro is the declaration of the enamoured swain.\r\n\r\nPerseverance spells success.  The pair are now face to face, she\r\nmotionless and grave, he all excitement.  With the tip of his leg, he\r\nventures to touch the plump wench.  He has gone too far, daring youth\r\nthat he is!  Panic-stricken, he takes a header, hanging by his safety-\r\nline.  It is only for a moment, however.  Up he comes again.  He has\r\nlearnt, from certain symptoms, that we are at last yielding to his\r\nblandishments.\r\n\r\nWith his legs and especially with his palpi, or feelers, he teases the\r\nbuxom gossip, who answers with curious skips and bounds.  Gripping a\r\nthread with her front tarsi, or fingers, she turns, one after the other,\r\na number of back somersaults, like those of an acrobat on the trapeze.\r\nHaving done this, she presents the under-part of her paunch to the dwarf\r\nand allows him to fumble at it a little with his feelers.  Nothing more:\r\nit is done.\r\n\r\nThe object of the expedition is attained.  The whipper-snapper makes off\r\nat full speed, as though he had the Furies at his heels.  If he remained,\r\nhe would presumably be eaten.  These exercises on the tight-rope are not\r\nrepeated.  I kept watch in vain on the following evenings: I never saw\r\nthe fellow again.\r\n\r\nWhen he is gone, the bride descends from the cable, spins her web and\r\nassumes the hunting-attitude.  We must eat to have silk, we must have\r\nsilk to eat and especially to weave the expensive cocoon of the family.\r\nThere is therefore no rest, not even after the excitement of being\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nThe Epeirae are monuments of patience in their lime-snare.  With her head\r\ndown and her eight legs wide-spread, the Spider occupies the centre of\r\nthe web, the receiving-point of the information sent along the spokes.  If\r\nanywhere, behind or before, a vibration occur, the sign of a capture, the\r\nEpeira knows about it, even without the aid of sight.  She hastens up at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nUntil then, not a movement: one would think that the animal was\r\nhypnotized by her watching.  At most, on the appearance of anything\r\nsuspicious, she begins shaking her nest.  This is her way of inspiring\r\nthe intruder with awe.  If I myself wish to provoke the singular alarm, I\r\nhave but to tease the Epeira with a bit of straw.  You cannot have a\r\nswing without an impulse of some sort.  The terror-stricken Spider, who\r\nwishes to strike terror into others, has hit upon something much better.\r\nWith nothing to push her, she swings with her floor of ropes.  There is\r\nno effort, no visible exertion.  Not a single part of the animal moves;\r\nand yet everything trembles.  Violent shaking proceeds from apparent\r\ninertia.  Rest causes commotion.\r\n\r\nWhen calm is restored, she resumes her attitude, ceaselessly pondering\r\nthe harsh problem of life:\r\n\r\n'Shall I dine to-day, or not?'\r\n\r\nCertain privileged beings, exempt from those anxieties, have food in\r\nabundance and need not struggle to obtain it.  Such is the Gentle, who\r\nswims blissfully in the broth of the putrefying adder.  Others--and, by a\r\nstrange irony of fate, these are generally the most gifted--only manage\r\nto eat by dint of craft and patience.\r\n\r\nYou are of their company, O my industrious Epeirae!  So that you may\r\ndine, you spend your treasures of patience nightly; and often without\r\nresult.  I sympathize with your woes, for I, who am as concerned as you\r\nabout my daily bread, I also doggedly spread my net, the net for catching\r\nideas, a more elusive and less substantial prize than the Moth.  Let us\r\nnot lose heart.  The best part of life is not in the present, still less\r\nin the past; it lies in the future, the domain of hope.  Let us wait.\r\n\r\nAll day long, the sky, of a uniform grey, has appeared to be brewing a\r\nstorm.  In spite of the threatened downpour, my neighbour, who is a\r\nshrewd weather-prophet, has come out of the cypress-tree and begun to\r\nrenew her web at the regular hour.  Her forecast is correct: it will be a\r\nfine night.  See, the steaming-pan of the clouds splits open; and,\r\nthrough the apertures, the moon peeps, inquisitively.  I too, lantern in\r\nhand, am peeping.  A gust of wind from the north clears the realms on\r\nhigh; the sky becomes magnificent; perfect calm reigns below.  The Moths\r\nbegin their nightly rounds.  Good!  One is caught, a mighty fine one.  The\r\nSpider will dine to-day.\r\n\r\nWhat happens next, in an uncertain light, does not lend itself to\r\naccurate observation.  It is better to turn to those Garden Spiders who\r\nnever leave their web and who hunt mainly in the daytime.  The Banded and\r\nthe Silky Epeira, both of whom live on the rosemaries in the enclosure,\r\nshall show us in broad day-light the innermost details of the tragedy.\r\n\r\nI myself place on the lime-snare a victim of my selecting.  Its six legs\r\nare caught without more ado.  If the insect raises one of its tarsi and\r\npulls towards itself, the treacherous thread follows, unwinds slightly\r\nand, without letting go or breaking, yields to the captive's desperate\r\njerks.  Any limb released only tangles the others still more and is\r\nspeedily recaptured by the sticky matter.  There is no means of escape,\r\nexcept by smashing the trap with a sudden effort whereof even powerful\r\ninsects are not always capable.\r\n\r\nWarned by the shaking of the net, the Epeira hastens up; she turns round\r\nabout the quarry; she inspects it at a distance, so as to ascertain the\r\nextent of the danger before attacking.  The strength of the snareling\r\nwill decide the plan of campaign.  Let us first suppose the usual case,\r\nthat of an average head of game, a Moth or Fly of some sort.  Facing her\r\nprisoner, the Spider contracts her abdomen slightly and touches the\r\ninsect for a moment with the end of her spinnerets; then, with her front\r\ntarsi, she sets her victim spinning.  The Squirrel, in the moving\r\ncylinder of his cage, does not display a more graceful or nimbler\r\ndexterity.  A cross-bar of the sticky spiral serves as an axis for the\r\ntiny machine, which turns, turns swiftly, like a spit.  It is a treat to\r\nthe eyes to see it revolve.\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of this circular motion?  See, the brief contact of\r\nthe spinnerets has given a starting-point for a thread, which the Spider\r\nmust now draw from her silk-warehouse and gradually roll around the\r\ncaptive, so as to swathe him in a winding-sheet which will overpower any\r\neffort made.  It is the exact process employed in our wire-mills: a motor-\r\ndriven spool revolves and, by its action, draws the wire through the\r\nnarrow eyelet of a steel plate, making it of the fineness required, and,\r\nwith the same movement, winds it round and round its collar.\r\n\r\nEven so with the Epeira's work.  The Spider's front tarsi are the motor;\r\nthe revolving spool is the captured insect; the steel eyelet is the\r\naperture of the spinnerets.  To bind the subject with precision and\r\ndispatch nothing could be better than this inexpensive and\r\nhighly-effective method.\r\n\r\nLess frequently, a second process is employed.  With a quick movement,\r\nthe Spider herself turns round about the motionless insect, crossing the\r\nweb first at the top and then at the bottom and gradually placing the\r\nfastenings of her line.  The great elasticity of the lime-threads allows\r\nthe Epeira to fling herself time after time right into the web and to\r\npass through it without damaging the net.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose the case of some dangerous game: a Praying Mantis, for\r\ninstance, brandishing her lethal limbs, each hooked and fitted with a\r\ndouble saw; an angry Hornet, darting her awful sting; a sturdy Beetle,\r\ninvincible under his horny armour.  These are exceptional morsels, hardly\r\never known to the Epeirae.  Will they be accepted, if supplied by my\r\nstratagems?\r\n\r\nThey are, but not without caution.  The game is seen to be perilous of\r\napproach and the Spider turns her back upon it, instead of facing it; she\r\ntrains her rope-cannon upon it.  Quickly, the hind-legs draw from the\r\nspinnerets something much better than single cords.  The whole\r\nsilk-battery works at one and the same time, firing a regular volley of\r\nribbons and sheets, which a wide movement of the legs spreads fan-wise\r\nand flings over the entangled prisoner.  Guarding against sudden starts,\r\nthe Epeira casts her armfuls of bands on the front-and hind-parts, over\r\nthe legs and over the wings, here, there and everywhere, extravagantly.\r\nThe most fiery prey is promptly mastered under this avalanche.  In vain,\r\nthe Mantis tries to open her saw-toothed arm-guards; in vain, the Hornet\r\nmakes play with her dagger; in vain, the Beetle stiffens his legs and\r\narches his back: a fresh wave of threads swoops down and paralyses every\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThese lavished, far-flung ribbons threaten to exhaust the factory; it\r\nwould be much more economical to resort to the method of the spool; but,\r\nto turn the machine, the Spider would have to go up to it and work it\r\nwith her leg.  This is too risky; and hence the continuous spray of silk,\r\nat a safe distance.  When all is used up, there is more to come.\r\n\r\nStill, the Epeira seems concerned at this excessive outlay.  When\r\ncircumstances permit, she gladly returns to the mechanism of the\r\nrevolving spool.  I saw her practise this abrupt change of tactics on a\r\nbig Beetle, with a smooth, plump body, which lent itself admirably to the\r\nrotary process.  After depriving the beast of all power of movement, she\r\nwent up to it and turned her corpulent victim as she would have done with\r\na medium-sized Moth.\r\n\r\nBut with the Praying Mantis, sticking out her long legs and her spreading\r\nwings, rotation is no longer feasible.  Then, until the quarry is\r\nthoroughly subdued, the spray of bandages goes on continuously, even to\r\nthe point of drying up the silk-glands.  A capture of this kind is\r\nruinous.  It is true that, except when I interfered, I have never seen\r\nthe Spider tackle that formidable provender.\r\n\r\nBe it feeble or strong, the game is now neatly trussed, by one of the two\r\nmethods.  The next move never varies.  The bound insect is bitten,\r\nwithout persistency and without any wound that shows.  The Spider next\r\nretires and allows the bite to act, which it soon does.  She then\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nIf the victim be small, a Clothes-moth, for instance, it is consumed on\r\nthe spot, at the place where it was captured.  But, for a prize of some\r\nimportance, on which she hopes to feast for many an hour, sometimes for\r\nmany a day, the Spider needs a sequestered dining-room, where there is\r\nnaught to fear from the stickiness of the network.  Before going to it,\r\nshe first makes her prey turn in the converse direction to that of the\r\noriginal rotation.  Her object is to free the nearest spokes, which\r\nsupplied pivots for the machinery.  They are essential factors which it\r\nbehoves her to keep intact, if need be by sacrificing a few cross-bars.\r\n\r\nIt is done; the twisted ends are put back into position.  The\r\nwell-trussed game is at last removed from the web and fastened on behind\r\nwith a thread.  The Spider then marches in front and the load is trundled\r\nacross the web and hoisted to the resting-floor, which is both an\r\ninspection-post and a dining-hall.  When the Spider is of a species that\r\nshuns the light and possesses a telegraph-line, she mounts to her daytime\r\nhiding-place along this line, with the game bumping against her heels.\r\n\r\nWhile she is refreshing herself, let us enquire into the effects of the\r\nlittle bite previously administered to the silk-swathed captive.  Does\r\nthe Spider kill the patient with a view to avoiding unseasonable jerks,\r\nprotests so disagreeable at dinner-time?  Several reasons make me doubt\r\nit.  In the first place, the attack is so much veiled as to have all the\r\nappearance of a mere kiss.  Besides, it is made anywhere, at the first\r\nspot that offers.  The expert slayers {33} employ methods of the highest\r\nprecision: they give a stab in the neck, or under the throat; they wound\r\nthe cervical nerve-centres, the seat of energy.  The paralyzers, those\r\naccomplished anatomists, poison the motor nerve-centres, of which they\r\nknow the number and position.  The Epeira possesses none of this fearsome\r\nknowledge.  She inserts her fangs at random, as the Bee does her sting.\r\nShe does not select one spot rather than another; she bites indifferently\r\nat whatever comes within reach.  This being so, her poison would have to\r\npossess unparalleled virulence to produce a corpse-like inertia no matter\r\nwhich the point attacked.  I can scarcely believe in instantaneous death\r\nresulting from the bite, especially in the case of insects, with their\r\nhighly-resistant organisms.\r\n\r\nBesides, is it really a corpse that the Epeira wants, she who feeds on\r\nblood much more than on flesh?  It were to her advantage to suck a live\r\nbody, wherein the flow of the liquids, set in movement by the pulsation\r\nof the dorsal vessel, that rudimentary heart of insects, must act more\r\nfreely than in a lifeless body, with its stagnant fluids.  The game which\r\nthe Spider means to suck dry might very well not be dead.  This is easily\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nI place some Locusts of different species on the webs in my menagerie,\r\none on this, another on that.  The Spider comes rushing up, binds the\r\nprey, nibbles at it gently and withdraws, waiting for the bite to take\r\neffect.  I then take the insect and carefully strip it of its silken\r\nshroud.  The Locust is not dead, far from it; one would even think that\r\nhe had suffered no harm.  I examine the released prisoner through the\r\nlens in vain; I can see no trace of a wound.\r\n\r\nCan he be unscathed, in spite of the sort of kiss which I saw given to\r\nhim just now?  You would be ready to say so, judging by the furious way\r\nin which he kicks in my fingers.  Nevertheless, when put on the ground,\r\nhe walks awkwardly, he seems reluctant to hop.  Perhaps it is a temporary\r\ntrouble, caused by his terrible excitement in the web.  It looks as\r\nthough it would soon pass.\r\n\r\nI lodge my Locusts in cages, with a lettuce-leaf to console them for\r\ntheir trials; but they will not be comforted.  A day elapses, followed by\r\na second.  Not one of them touches the leaf of salad; their appetite has\r\ndisappeared.  Their movements become more uncertain, as though hampered\r\nby irresistible torpor.  On the second day, they are dead, every one\r\nirrecoverably dead.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira, therefore, does not incontinently kill her prey with her\r\ndelicate bite; she poisons it so as to produce a gradual weakness, which\r\ngives the blood-sucker ample time to drain her victim, without the least\r\nrisk, before the rigor mortis stops the flow of moisture.\r\n\r\nThe meal lasts quite twenty-four hours, if the joint be large; and to the\r\nvery end the butchered insect retains a remnant of life, a favourable\r\ncondition for the exhausting of the juices.  Once again, we see a skilful\r\nmethod of slaughter, very different from the tactics in use among the\r\nexpert paralyzers or slayers.  Here there is no display of anatomical\r\nscience.  Unacquainted with the patient's structure, the Spider stabs at\r\nrandom.  The virulence of the poison does the rest.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some very few cases in which the bite is speedily\r\nmortal.  My notes speak of an Angular Epeira grappling with the largest\r\nDragon-fly in my district (_AEshna grandis_, LIN.).  I myself had\r\nentangled in the web this head of big game, which is not often captured\r\nby the Epeirae.  The net shakes violently, seems bound to break its\r\nmoorings.\r\n\r\nThe Spider rushes from her leafy villa, runs boldly up to the giantess,\r\nflings a single bundle of ropes at her and, without further precautions,\r\ngrips her with her legs, tries to subdue her and then digs her fangs into\r\nthe Dragon-fly's back.  The bite is prolonged in such a way as to\r\nastonish me.  This is not the perfunctory kiss with which I am already\r\nfamiliar; it is a deep, determined wound.  After striking her blow, the\r\nSpider retires to a certain distance and waits for her poison to take\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nI at once remove the Dragon-fly.  She is dead, really and truly dead.\r\nLaid upon my table and left alone for twenty-four hours, she makes not\r\nthe slightest movement.  A prick of which my lens cannot see the marks,\r\nso sharp-pointed are the Epeira's weapons, was enough, with a little\r\ninsistence, to kill the powerful animal.  Proportionately, the\r\nRattlesnake, the Horned Viper, the Trigonocephalus and other ill-famed\r\nserpents produce less paralysing effects upon their victims.\r\n\r\nAnd these Epeirae, so terrible to insects, I am able to handle without\r\nany fear.  My skin does not suit them.  If I persuaded them to bite me,\r\nwhat would happen to me?  Hardly anything.  We have more cause to dread\r\nthe sting of a nettle than the dagger which is fatal to Dragon-flies.  The\r\nsame virus acts differently upon this organism and that, is formidable\r\nhere and quite mild there.  What kills the insect may easily be harmless\r\nto us.  Let us not, however, generalize too far.  The Narbonne Lycosa,\r\nthat other enthusiastic insect-huntress, would make us pay clearly if we\r\nattempted to take liberties with her.\r\n\r\nIt is not uninteresting to watch the Epeira at dinner.  I light upon one,\r\nthe Banded Epeira, at the moment, about three o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nwhen she has captured a Locust.  Planted in the centre of the web, on her\r\nresting-floor, she attacks the venison at the joint of a haunch.  There\r\nis no movement, not even of the mouth-parts, as far as I am able to\r\ndiscover.  The mouth lingers, close-applied, at the point originally\r\nbitten.  There are no intermittent mouthfuls, with the mandibles moving\r\nbackwards and forwards.  It is a sort of continuous kiss.\r\n\r\nI visit my Epeira at intervals.  The mouth does not change its place.  I\r\nvisit her for the last time at nine o'clock in the evening.  Matters\r\nstand exactly as they did: after six hours' consumption, the mouth is\r\nstill sucking at the lower end of the right haunch.  The fluid contents\r\nof the victim are transferred to the ogress' belly, I know not how.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the Spider is still at table.  I take away her dish.  Naught\r\nremains of the Locust but his skin, hardly altered in shape, but utterly\r\ndrained and perforated in several places.  The method, therefore, was\r\nchanged during the night.  To extract the non-fluent residue, the viscera\r\nand muscles, the stiff cuticle had to be tapped here, there and\r\nelsewhere, after which the tattered husk, placed bodily in the press of\r\nthe mandibles, would have been chewed, rechewed and finally reduced to a\r\npill, which the sated Spider throws up.  This would have been the end of\r\nthe victim, had I not taken it away before the time.\r\n\r\nWhether she wound or kill, the Epeira bites her captive somewhere or\r\nother, no matter where.  This is an excellent method on her part, because\r\nof the variety of the game that comes her way.  I see her accepting with\r\nequal readiness whatever chance may send her: Butterflies and\r\nDragon-flies, Flies and Wasps, small Dung-beetles and Locusts.  If I\r\noffer her a Mantis, a Bumble-bee, an Anoxia--the equivalent of the common\r\nCockchafer--and other dishes probably unknown to her race, she accepts\r\nall and any, large and small, thin-skinned and horny-skinned, that which\r\ngoes afoot and that which takes winged flight.  She is omnivorous, she\r\npreys on everything, down to her own kind, should the occasion offer.\r\n\r\nHad she to operate according to individual structure, she would need an\r\nanatomical dictionary; and instinct is essentially unfamiliar with\r\ngeneralities: its knowledge is always confined to limited points.  The\r\nCerceres know their Weevils and their Buprestis-beetles absolutely; the\r\nSphex their Grasshoppers, their Crickets and their Locusts; the Scoliae\r\n{34} their Cetonia- and Oryctes-grubs.  Even so the other paralyzers.\r\nEach has her own victim and knows nothing of any of the others.\r\n\r\nThe same exclusive tastes prevail among the slayers.  Let us remember, in\r\nthis connection, _Philanthus apivorus_ {35} and, especially, the\r\nThomisus, the comely Spider who cuts Bees' throats.  They understand the\r\nfatal blow, either in the neck or under the chin, a thing which the\r\nEpeira does not understand; but, just because of this talent, they are\r\nspecialists.  Their province is the Domestic Bee.\r\n\r\nAnimals are a little like ourselves: they excel in an art only on\r\ncondition of specializing in it.  The Epeira, who, being omnivorous, is\r\nobliged to generalize, abandons scientific methods and makes up for this\r\nby distilling a poison capable of producing torpor and even death, no\r\nmatter what the point attacked.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the large variety of game, we wonder how the Epeira manages\r\nnot to hesitate amid those many diverse forms, how, for instance, she\r\npasses from the Locust to the Butterfly, so different in appearance.  To\r\nattribute to her as a guide an extensive zoological knowledge were wildly\r\nin excess of what we may reasonably expect of her poor intelligence.  The\r\nthing moves, therefore it is worth catching: this formula seems to sum up\r\nthe Spider's wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV: THE GARDEN SPIDERS: THE QUESTION OF PROPERTY\r\n\r\n\r\nA dog has found a bone.  He lies in the shade, holding it between his\r\npaws, and studies it fondly.  It is his sacred property, his chattel.  An\r\nEpeira has woven her web.  Here again is property; and owning a better\r\ntitle than the other.  Favoured by chance and assisted by his scent, the\r\nDog has merely had a find; he has neither worked nor paid for it.  The\r\nSpider is more than a casual owner, she has created what is hers.  Its\r\nsubstance issued from her body, its structure from her brain.  If ever\r\nproperty was sacrosanct, hers is.\r\n\r\nFar higher stands the work of the weaver of ideas, who tissues a book,\r\nthat other Spider's web, and out of his thought makes something that\r\nshall instruct or thrill us.  To protect our 'bone,' we have the police,\r\ninvented for the express purpose.  To protect the book, we have none but\r\nfarcical means.  Place a few bricks one atop the other; join them with\r\nmortar; and the law will defend your wall.  Build up in writing an\r\nedifice of your thoughts; and it will be open to any one, without serious\r\nimpediment, to abstract stones from it, even to take the whole, if it\r\nsuit him.  A rabbit-hutch is property; the work of the mind is not.  If\r\nthe animal has eccentric views as regards the possessions of others, we\r\nhave ours as well.\r\n\r\n'Might always has the best of the argument,' said La Fontaine, to the\r\ngreat scandal of the peace-lovers.  The exigencies of verse, rhyme and\r\nrhythm, carried the worthy fabulist further than he intended: he meant to\r\nsay that, in a fight between mastiffs and in other brute conflicts, the\r\nstronger is left master of the bone.  He well knew that, as things go,\r\nsuccess is no certificate of excellence.  Others came, the notorious evil-\r\ndoers of humanity, who made a law of the savage maxim that might is\r\nright.\r\n\r\nWe are the larvae with the changing skins, the ugly caterpillars of a\r\nsociety that is slowly, very slowly, wending its way to the triumph of\r\nright over might.  When will this sublime metamorphosis be accomplished?\r\nTo free ourselves from those wild-beast brutalities, must we wait for the\r\nocean-plains of the southern hemisphere to flow to our side, changing the\r\nface of continents and renewing the glacial period of the Reindeer and\r\nthe Mammoth?  Perhaps, so slow is moral progress.\r\n\r\nTrue, we have the bicycle, the motor-car, the dirigible airship and other\r\nmarvellous means of breaking our bones; but our morality is not one rung\r\nthe higher for it all.  One would even say that, the farther we proceed\r\nin our conquest of matter, the more our morality recedes.  The most\r\nadvanced of our inventions consists in bringing men down with grapeshot\r\nand explosives with the swiftness of the reaper mowing the corn.\r\n\r\nWould we see this might triumphant in all its beauty?  Let us spend a few\r\nweeks in the Epeira's company.  She is the owner of a web, her work, her\r\nmost lawful property.  The question at once presents itself: Does the\r\nSpider possibly recognize her fabric by certain trademarks and\r\ndistinguish it from that of her fellows?\r\n\r\nI bring about a change of webs between two neighbouring Banded Epeirae.\r\nNo sooner is either placed upon the strange net than she makes for the\r\ncentral floor, settles herself head downwards and does not stir from it,\r\nsatisfied with her neighbour's web as with her own.  Neither by day nor\r\nby night does she try to shift her quarters and restore matters to their\r\npristine state.  Both Spiders think themselves in their own domain.  The\r\ntwo pieces of work are so much alike that I almost expected this.\r\n\r\nI then decide to effect an exchange of webs between two different\r\nspecies.  I move the Banded Epeira to the net of the Silky Epeira and\r\nvice versa.  The two webs are now dissimilar; the Silky Epeira's has a\r\nlimy spiral consisting of closer and more numerous circles.  What will\r\nthe Spiders do, when thus put to the test of the unknown?  One would\r\nthink that, when one of them found meshes too wide for her under her\r\nfeet, the other meshes too narrow, they would be frightened by this\r\nsudden change and decamp in terror.  Not at all.  Without a sign of\r\nperturbation, they remain, plant themselves in the centre and await the\r\ncoming of the game, as though nothing extraordinary had happened.  They\r\ndo more than this.  Days pass and, as long as the unfamiliar web is not\r\nwrecked to the extent of being unserviceable, they make no attempt to\r\nweave another in their own style.  The Spider, therefore, is incapable of\r\nrecognizing her web.  She takes another's work for hers, even when it is\r\nproduced by a stranger to her race.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the tragic side of this confusion.  Wishing to have\r\nsubjects for study within my daily reach and to save myself the trouble\r\nof casual excursions, I collect different Epeirae whom I find in the\r\ncourse of my walks and establish them on the shrubs in my enclosure.  In\r\nthis way, a rosemary-hedge, sheltered from the wind and facing the sun,\r\nis turned into a well-stocked menagerie.  I take the Spiders from the\r\npaper bags wherein I had put them separately, to carry them, and place\r\nthem on the leaves, with no further precaution.  It is for them to make\r\nthemselves at home.  As a rule, they do not budge all day from the place\r\nwhere I put them: they wait for nightfall before seeking a suitable site\r\nwhereon to weave a net.\r\n\r\nSome among them show less patience.  A little while ago, they possessed a\r\nweb, between the reeds of a brook or in the holm-oak copses; and now they\r\nhave none.  They go off in search, to recover their property or seize on\r\nsome one else's: it is all the same to them.  I come upon a Banded\r\nEpeira, newly imported, making for the web of a Silky Epeira who has been\r\nmy guest for some days now.  The owner is at her post, in the centre of\r\nthe net.  She awaits the stranger with seeming impassiveness.  Then\r\nsuddenly they grip each other; and a desperate fight begins.  The Silky\r\nEpeira is worsted.  The other swathes her in bonds, drags her to the non-\r\nlimy central floor and, in the calmest fashion, eats her.  The dead\r\nSpider is munched for twenty-four hours and drained to the last drop,\r\nwhen the corpse, a wretched, crumpled ball, is at last flung aside.  The\r\nweb so foully conquered becomes the property of the stranger, who uses\r\nit, if it have not suffered too much in the contest.\r\n\r\nThere is here a shadow of an excuse.  The two Spiders were of different\r\nspecies; and the struggle for life often leads to these exterminations\r\namong such as are not akin.  What would happen if the two belonged to the\r\nsame species?  It is easily seen.  I cannot rely upon spontaneous\r\ninvasions, which may be rare under normal conditions, and I myself place\r\na Banded Epeira on her kinswoman's web.  A furious attack is made\r\nforthwith.  Victory, after hanging for a moment in the balance, is once\r\nagain decided in the stranger's favour.  The vanquished party, this time\r\na sister, is eaten without the slightest scruple.  Her web becomes the\r\nproperty of the victor.\r\n\r\nThere it is, in all its horror, the right of might: to eat one's like and\r\ntake away their goods.  Man did the same in days of old: he stripped and\r\nate his fellows.  We continue to rob one another, both as nations and as\r\nindividuals; but we no longer eat one another: the custom has grown\r\nobsolete since we discovered an acceptable substitute in the mutton-chop.\r\n\r\nLet us not, however, blacken the Spider beyond her deserts.  She does not\r\nlive by warring on her kith and kin; she does not of her own accord\r\nattempt the conquest of another's property.  It needs extraordinary\r\ncircumstances to rouse her to these villainies.  I take her from her web\r\nand place her on another's.  From that moment, she knows no distinction\r\nbetween _meum_ and _tuum_: the thing which the leg touches at once\r\nbecomes real estate.  And the intruder, if she be the stronger, ends by\r\neating the occupier, a radical means of cutting short disputes.\r\n\r\nApart from disturbances similar to those provoked by myself, disturbances\r\nthat are possible in the everlasting conflict of events, the Spider,\r\njealous of her own web, seems to respect the webs of others.  She never\r\nindulges in brigandage against her fellows except when dispossessed of\r\nher net, especially in the daytime, for weaving is never done by day:\r\nthis work is reserved for the night.  When, however, she is deprived of\r\nher livelihood and feels herself the stronger, then she attacks her\r\nneighbour, rips her open, feeds on her and takes possession of her goods.\r\nLet us make allowances and proceed.\r\n\r\nWe will now examine Spiders of more alien habits.  The Banded and the\r\nSilky Epeira differ greatly in form and colouring.  The first has a\r\nplump, olive-shaped belly, richly belted with white, bright-yellow and\r\nblack; the second's abdomen is flat, of a silky white and pinked into\r\nfestoons.  Judging only by dress and figure, we should not think of\r\nclosely connecting the two Spiders.\r\n\r\nBut high above shapes tower tendencies, those main characteristics which\r\nour methods of classification, so particular about minute details of\r\nform, ought to consult more widely than they do.  The two dissimilar\r\nSpiders have exactly similar ways of living.  Both of them prefer to hunt\r\nby day and never leave their webs; both sign their work with a zigzag\r\nflourish.  Their nets are almost identical, so much so that the Banded\r\nEpeira uses the Silky Epeira's web after eating its owner.  The Silky\r\nEpeira, on her side, when she is the stronger, dispossesses her belted\r\ncousin and devours her.  Each is at home on the other's web, when the\r\nargument of might triumphant has ended the discussion.\r\n\r\nLet us next take the case of the Cross Spider, a hairy beast of varying\r\nshades of reddish-brown.  She has three large white spots upon her back,\r\nforming a triple-barred cross.  She hunts mostly at night, shuns the sun\r\nand lives by day on the adjacent shrubs, in a shady retreat which\r\ncommunicates with the lime-snare by means of a telegraph-wire.  Her web\r\nis very similar in structure and appearance to those of the two others.\r\nWhat will happen if I procure her the visit of a Banded Epeira?\r\n\r\nThe lady of the triple cross is invaded by day, in the full light of the\r\nsun, thanks to my mischievous intermediary.  The web is deserted; the\r\nproprietress is in her leafy hut.  The telegraph-wire performs its\r\noffice; the Cross Spider hastens down, strides all round her property,\r\nbeholds the danger and hurriedly returns to her hiding-place, without\r\ntaking any measures against the intruder.\r\n\r\nThe latter, on her side, does not seem to be enjoying herself.  Were she\r\nplaced on the web of one of her sisters, or even on that of the Silky\r\nEpeira, she would have posted herself in the centre, as soon as the\r\nstruggle had ended in the other's death.  This time there is no struggle,\r\nfor the web is deserted; nothing prevents her from taking her position in\r\nthe centre, the chief strategic point; and yet she does not move from the\r\nplace where I put her.\r\n\r\nI tickle her gently with the tip of a long straw.  When at home, if\r\nteased in this way, the Banded Epeira--like the others, for that\r\nmatter--violently shakes the web to intimidate the aggressor.  This time,\r\nnothing happens: despite my repeated enticements, the Spider does not\r\nstir a limb.  It is as though she were numbed with terror.  And she has\r\nreason to be: the other is watching her from her lofty loop-hole.\r\n\r\nThis is probably not the only cause of her fright.  When my straw does\r\ninduce her to take a few steps, I see her lift her legs with some\r\ndifficulty.  She tugs a bit, drags her tarsi till she almost breaks the\r\nsupporting threads.  It is not the progress of an agile rope-walker; it\r\nis the hesitating gait of entangled feet.  Perhaps the lime-threads are\r\nstickier than in her own web.  The glue is of a different quality; and\r\nher sandals are not greased to the extent which the new degree of\r\nadhesiveness would demand.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, things remain as they are for long hours on end: the Banded\r\nEpeira motionless on the edge of the web; the other lurking in her hut;\r\nboth apparently most uneasy.  At sunset, the lover of darkness plucks up\r\ncourage.  She descends from her green tent and, without troubling about\r\nthe stranger, goes straight to the centre of the web, where the telegraph-\r\nwire brings her.  Panic-stricken at this apparition, the Banded Epeira\r\nreleases herself with a jerk and disappears in the rosemary-thicket.\r\n\r\nThe experiment, though repeatedly renewed with different subjects, gave\r\nme no other results.  Distrustful of a web dissimilar to her own, if not\r\nin structure, at least in stickiness, the bold Banded Epeira shows the\r\nwhite feather and refuses to attack the Cross Spider.  The latter, on her\r\nside, either does not budge from her day shelter in the foliage, or else\r\nrushes back to it, after taking a hurried glance at the stranger.  She\r\nhere awaits the coming of the night.  Under favour of the darkness, which\r\ngives her fresh courage and activity, she reappears upon the scene and\r\nputs the intruder to flight by her mere presence, aided, if need be, by a\r\ncuff or two.  Injured right is the victor.\r\n\r\nMorality is satisfied; but let us not congratulate the Spider therefore.\r\nIf the invader respects the invaded, it is because very serious reasons\r\nimpel her.  First, she would have to contend with an adversary ensconced\r\nin a stronghold whose ambushes are unknown to the assailant.  Secondly,\r\nthe web, if conquered, would be inconvenient to use, because of the lime-\r\nthreads, possessing a different degree of stickiness from those which she\r\nknows so well.  To risk one's skin for a thing of doubtful value were\r\ntwice foolish.  The Spider knows this and forbears.\r\n\r\nBut let the Banded Epeira, deprived of her web, come upon that of one of\r\nher kind or of the Silky Epeira, who works her gummy twine in the same\r\nmanner: then discretion is thrown to the winds; the owner is fiercely\r\nripped open and possession taken of the property.\r\n\r\nMight is right, says the beast; or, rather, it knows no right.  The\r\nanimal world is a rout of appetites, acknowledging no other rein than\r\nimpotence.  Mankind, alone capable of emerging from the slough of the\r\ninstincts, is bringing equity into being, is creating it slowly as its\r\nconception grows clearer.  Out of the sacred rushlight, so flickering as\r\nyet, but gaining strength from age to age, man will make a flaming torch\r\nthat will put an end, among us, to the principles of the brutes and, one\r\nday, utterly change the face of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV: THE LABYRINTH SPIDER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Epeirae, with their gorgeous net-tapestries, are incomparable\r\nweavers, many other Spiders excel in ingenious devices for filling their\r\nstomachs and leaving a lineage behind them: the two primary laws of\r\nliving things.  Some of them are celebrities of long-standing renown, who\r\nare mentioned in all the books.\r\n\r\nCertain Mygales {36} inhabit a burrow, like the Narbonne Lycosa, but of a\r\nperfection unknown to the brutal Spider of the waste-lands.  The Lycosa\r\nsurrounds the mouth of her shaft with a simple parapet, a mere collection\r\nof tiny pebbles, sticks and silk; the others fix a movable door to\r\ntheirs, a round shutter with a hinge, a groove and a set of bolts.  When\r\nthe Mygale comes home, the lid drops into the groove and fits so exactly\r\nthat there is no possibility of distinguishing the join.  If the\r\naggressor persist and seek to raise the trap-door, the recluse pushes the\r\nbolt, that is to say, plants her claws into certain holes on the opposite\r\nside to the hinge, props herself against the wall and holds the door\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\nAnother, the Argyroneta, or Water Spider, builds herself an elegant\r\nsilken diving-bell, in which she stores air.  Thus supplied with the\r\nwherewithal to breathe, she awaits the coming of the game and keeps\r\nherself cool meanwhile.  At times of scorching heat, hers must be a\r\nregular sybaritic abode, such as eccentric man has sometimes ventured to\r\nbuild under water, with mighty blocks of stone and marble.  The submarine\r\npalaces of Tiberius are no more than an odious memory; the Water Spider's\r\ndainty cupola still flourishes.\r\n\r\nIf I possessed documents derived from personal observation, I should like\r\nto speak of these ingenious workers; I would gladly add a few unpublished\r\nfacts to their life-history.  But I must abandon the idea.  The Water\r\nSpider is not found in my district.  The Mygale, the expert in hinged\r\ndoors, is found there, but very seldom.  I saw one once, on the edge of a\r\npath skirting a copse.  Opportunity, as we know, is fleeting.  The\r\nobserver, more than any other, is obliged to take it by the forelock.\r\nPreoccupied as I was with other researches, I but gave a glance at the\r\nmagnificent subject which good fortune offered.  The opportunity fled and\r\nhas never returned.\r\n\r\nLet us make up for it with trivial things of frequent encounter, a\r\ncondition favourable to consecutive study.  What is common is not\r\nnecessarily unimportant.  Give it our sustained attention and we shall\r\ndiscover in it merits which our former ignorance prevented us from\r\nseeing.  When patiently entreated, the least of creatures adds its note\r\nto the harmonies of life.\r\n\r\nIn the fields around, traversed, in these days, with a tired step, but\r\nstill vigilantly explored, I find nothing so often as the Labyrinth\r\nSpider (_Agelena labyrinthica_, CLERCK.).  Not a hedge but shelters a few\r\nat its foot, amidst grass, in quiet, sunny nooks.  In the open country\r\nand especially in hilly places laid bare by the wood-man's axe, the\r\nfavourite sites are tufts of bracken, rock-rose, lavender, everlasting\r\nand rosemary cropped close by the teeth of the flocks.  This is where I\r\nresort, as the isolation and kindliness of the supports lend themselves\r\nto proceedings which might not be tolerated by the unfriendly hedge.\r\n\r\nSeveral times a week, in July, I go to study my Spiders on the spot, at\r\nan early hour, before the sun beats fiercely on one's neck.  The children\r\naccompany me, each provided with an orange wherewith to slake the thirst\r\nthat will not be slow in coming.  They lend me their good eyes and supple\r\nlimbs.  The expedition promises to be fruitful.\r\n\r\nWe soon discover high silk buildings, betrayed at a distance by the\r\nglittering threads which the dawn has converted into dewy rosaries.  The\r\nchildren are wonderstruck at those glorious chandeliers, so much so that\r\nthey forget their oranges for a moment.  Nor am I, on my part,\r\nindifferent.  A splendid spectacle indeed is that of our Spider's\r\nlabyrinth, heavy with the tears of the night and lit up by the first rays\r\nof the sun.  Accompanied as it is by the Thrushes' symphony, this alone\r\nis worth getting up for.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour's heat; and the magic jewels disappear with the dew.  Now is\r\nthe moment to inspect the webs.  Here is one spreading its sheet over a\r\nlarge cluster of rock-roses; it is the size of a handkerchief.  A\r\nprofusion of guy-ropes, attached to any chance projection, moor it to the\r\nbrushwood.  There is not a twig but supplies a contact-point.  Entwined\r\non every side, surrounded and surmounted, the bush disappears from view,\r\nveiled in white muslin.\r\n\r\nThe web is flat at the edges, as far as the unevenness of the support\r\npermits, and gradually hollows into a crater, not unlike the bell of a\r\nhunting-horn.  The central portion is a cone-shaped gulf, a funnel whose\r\nneck, narrowing by degrees, dives perpendicularly into the leafy thicket\r\nto a depth of eight or nine inches.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the tube, in the gloom of that murderous alley, sits\r\nthe Spider, who looks at us and betrays no great excitement at our\r\npresence.  She is grey, modestly adorned on the thorax with two black\r\nribbons and on the abdomen with two stripes in which white specks\r\nalternate with brown.  At the tip of the belly, two small, mobile\r\nappendages form a sort of tail, a rather curious feature in a Spider.\r\n\r\nThe crater-shaped web is not of the same structure throughout.  At the\r\nborders, it is a gossamer weft of sparse threads; nearer the centre, the\r\ntexture becomes first fine muslin and then satin; lower still, on the\r\nnarrower part of the opening, it is a network of roughly lozenged meshes.\r\nLastly, the neck of the funnel, the usual resting-place, is formed of\r\nsolid silk.\r\n\r\nThe Spider never ceases working at her carpet, which represents her\r\ninvestigation-platform.  Every night she goes to it, walks over it,\r\ninspecting her snares, extending her domain and increasing it with new\r\nthreads.  The work is done with the silk constantly hanging from the\r\nspinnerets and constantly extracted as the animal moves about.  The neck\r\nof the funnel, being more often walked upon than the rest of the\r\ndwelling, is therefore provided with a thicker upholstery.  Beyond it are\r\nthe slopes of the crater, which are also much-frequented regions.  Spokes\r\nof some regularity fix the diameter of the mouth; a swaying walk and the\r\nguiding aid of the caudal appendages have laid lozengy meshes across\r\nthese spokes.  This part has been strengthened by the nightly rounds of\r\ninspection.  Lastly come the less-visited expanses, which consequently\r\nhave a thinner carpet.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the passage dipping into the brushwood, we might expect\r\nto find a secret cabin, a wadded cell where the Spider would take refuge\r\nin her hours of leisure.  The reality is something entirely different.\r\nThe long funnel-neck gapes at its lower end, where a private door stands\r\nalways ajar, allowing the animal, when hard-pushed, to escape through the\r\ngrass and gain the open.\r\n\r\nIt is well to know this arrangement of the home, if you wish to capture\r\nthe Spider without hurting her.  When attacked from the front, the\r\nfugitive runs down and slips through the postern-gate at the bottom.  To\r\nlook for her by rummaging in the brushwood often leads to nothing, so\r\nswift is her flight; besides, a blind search entails a great risk of\r\nmaiming her.  Let us eschew violence, which is but seldom successful, and\r\nresort to craft.\r\n\r\nWe catch sight of the Spider at the entrance to her tube.  If\r\npracticable, squeeze the bottom of the tuft, containing the neck of the\r\nfunnel, with both hands.  That is enough; the animal is caught.  Feeling\r\nits retreat cut off, it readily darts into the paper bag held out to it;\r\nif necessary, it can be stimulated with a bit of straw.  In this way, I\r\nfill my cages with subjects that have not been demoralized by contusions.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the crater is not exactly a snare.  It is just possible\r\nfor the casual pedestrian to catch his legs in the silky carpets; but\r\ngiddy-pates who come here for a walk must be very rare.  What is wanted\r\nis a trap capable of securing the game that hops or flies.  The Epeira\r\nhas her treacherous limed net; the Spider of the bushes has her no less\r\ntreacherous labyrinth.\r\n\r\nLook above the web.  What a forest of ropes!  It might be the rigging of\r\na ship disabled by a storm.  They run from every twig of the supporting\r\nshrubs, they are fastened to the tip of every branch.  There are long\r\nropes and short ropes, upright and slanting, straight and bent, taut and\r\nslack, all criss-cross and a-tangle, to the height of three feet or so in\r\ninextricable disorder.  The whole forms a chaos of netting, a labyrinth\r\nwhich none can pass through, unless he be endowed with wings of\r\nexceptional power.\r\n\r\nWe have here nothing similar to the lime-threads used by the Garden\r\nSpiders.  The threads are not sticky; they act only by their confused\r\nmultitude.  Would you care to see the trap at work?  Throw a small Locust\r\ninto the rigging.  Unable to obtain a steady foothold on that shaky\r\nsupport, he flounders about; and the more he struggles the more he\r\nentangles his shackles.  The Spider, spying on the threshold of her\r\nabyss, lets him have his way.  She does not run up the shrouds of the\r\nmast-work to seize the desperate prisoner; she waits until his bonds of\r\nthreads, twisted backwards and forwards, make him fall on the web.\r\n\r\nHe falls; the other comes and flings herself upon her prostrate prey.  The\r\nattack is not without danger.  The Locust is demoralized rather than tied\r\nup; it is merely bits of broken thread that he is trailing from his legs.\r\nThe bold assailant does not mind.  Without troubling, like the Epeirae,\r\nto bury her capture under a paralysing winding-sheet, she feels it, to\r\nmake sure of its quality, and then, regardless of kicks, inserts her\r\nfangs.\r\n\r\nThe bite is usually given at the lower end of a haunch: not that this\r\nplace is more vulnerable than any other thin-skinned part, but probably\r\nbecause it has a better flavour.  The different webs which I inspect to\r\nstudy the food in the larder show me, among other joints, various Flies\r\nand small Butterflies and carcasses of almost-untouched Locusts, all\r\ndeprived of their hind-legs, or at least of one.  Locusts' legs often\r\ndangle, emptied of their succulent contents, on the edges of the web,\r\nfrom the meat-hooks of the butcher's shop.  In my urchin-days, days free\r\nfrom prejudices in regard to what one ate, I, like many others, was able\r\nto appreciate that dainty.  It is the equivalent, on a very small scale,\r\nof the larger legs of the Crayfish.\r\n\r\nThe rigging-builder, therefore, to whom we have just thrown a Locust\r\nattacks the prey at the lower end of a thigh.  The bite is a lingering\r\none: once the Spider has planted her fangs, she does not let go.  She\r\ndrinks, she sips, she sucks.  When this first point is drained, she\r\npasses on to others, to the second haunch in particular, until the prey\r\nbecomes an empty hulk without losing its outline.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Garden Spiders feed in a similar way, bleeding their\r\nvenison and drinking it instead of eating it.  At last, however, in the\r\ncomfortable post-prandial hours, they take up the drained morsel, chew\r\nit, rechew it and reduce it to a shapeless ball.  It is a dessert for the\r\nteeth to toy with.  The Labyrinth Spider knows nothing of the diversions\r\nof the table; she flings the drained remnants out of her web, without\r\nchewing them.  Although it lasts long, the meal is eaten in perfect\r\nsafety.  From the first bite, the Locust becomes a lifeless thing; the\r\nSpider's poison has settled him.\r\n\r\nThe labyrinth is greatly inferior, as a work of art, to that advanced\r\ngeometrical contrivance, the Garden Spider's net; and, in spite of its\r\ningenuity, it does not give a favourable notion of its constructor.  It\r\nis hardly more than a shapeless scaffolding, run up anyhow.  And yet,\r\nlike the others, the builder of this slovenly edifice must have her own\r\nprinciples of beauty and accuracy.  As it is, the prettily-latticed mouth\r\nof the crater makes us suspect this; the nest, the mother's usual\r\nmasterpiece, will prove it to the full.\r\n\r\nWhen laying-time is at hand, the Spider changes her residence; she\r\nabandons her web in excellent condition; she does not return to it.  Whoso\r\nwill can take possession of the house.  The hour has come to found the\r\nfamily-establishment.  But where?  The Spider knows right well; I am in\r\nthe dark.  Mornings are spent in fruitless searches.  In vain I ransack\r\nthe bushes that carry the webs: I never find aught that realizes my\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nI learn the secret at last.  I chance upon a web which, though deserted,\r\nis not yet dilapidated, proving that it has been but lately quitted.\r\nInstead of hunting in the brushwood whereon it rests, let us inspect the\r\nneighbourhood, to a distance of a few paces.  If these contain a low,\r\nthick cluster, the nest is there, hidden from the eye.  It carries an\r\nauthentic certificate of its origin, for the mother invariably occupies\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBy this method of investigation, far from the labyrinth-trap, I become\r\nthe owner of as many nests as are needed to satisfy my curiosity.  They\r\ndo not by a long way come up to my idea of the maternal talent.  They are\r\nclumsy bundles of dead leaves, roughly drawn together with silk threads.\r\nUnder this rude covering is a pouch of fine texture containing the egg-\r\ncasket, all in very bad condition, because of the inevitable tears\r\nincurred in its extrication from the brushwood.  No, I shall not be able\r\nto judge of the artist's capacity by these rags and tatters.\r\n\r\nThe insect, in its buildings, has its own architectural rules, rules as\r\nunchangeable as anatomical peculiarities.  Each group builds according to\r\nthe same set of principles, conforming to the laws of a very elementary\r\nsystem of aesthetics; but often circumstances beyond the architect's\r\ncontrol--the space at her disposal, the unevenness of the site, the\r\nnature of the material and other accidental causes--interfere with the\r\nworker's plans and disturb the structure.  Then virtual regularity is\r\ntranslated into actual chaos; order degenerates into disorder.\r\n\r\nWe might discover an interesting subject of research in the type adopted\r\nby each species when the work is accomplished without hindrances.  The\r\nBanded Epeira weaves the wallet of her eggs in the open, on a slim branch\r\nthat does not get in her way; and her work is a superbly artistic jar.\r\nThe Silky Epeira also has all the elbow-room she needs; and her\r\nparaboloid is not without elegance.  Can the Labyrinth Spider, that other\r\nspinstress of accomplished merit, be ignorant of the precepts of beauty\r\nwhen the time comes for her to weave a tent for her offspring?  As yet,\r\nwhat I have seen of her work is but an unsightly bundle.  Is that all she\r\ncan do?\r\n\r\nI look for better things if circumstances favour her.  Toiling in the\r\nmidst of a dense thicket, among a tangle of dead leaves and twigs, she\r\nmay well produce a very inaccurate piece of work; but compel her to\r\nlabour when free from all impediment: she will then--I am convinced of it\r\nbeforehand--apply her talents without constraint and show herself an\r\nadept in the building of graceful nests.\r\n\r\nAs laying-time approaches, towards the middle of August, I instal half-a-\r\ndozen Labyrinth Spiders in large wire-gauze cages, each standing in an\r\nearthen pan filled with sand.  A sprig of thyme, planted in the centre,\r\nwill furnish supports for the structure, together with the trellis-work\r\nof the top and sides.  There is no other furniture, no dead leaves, which\r\nwould spoil the shape of the nest if the mother were minded to employ\r\nthem as a covering.  By way of provision, Locusts, every day.  They are\r\nreadily accepted, provided they be tender and not too large.\r\n\r\nThe experiment works perfectly.  August is hardly over before I am in\r\npossession of six nests, magnificent in shape and of a dazzling\r\nwhiteness.  The latitude of the workshop has enabled the spinstress to\r\nfollow the inspiration of her instinct without serious obstacles; and the\r\nresult is a masterpiece of symmetry and elegance, if we allow for a few\r\nangularities demanded by the suspension-points.\r\n\r\nIt is an oval of exquisite white muslin, a diaphanous abode wherein the\r\nmother must make a long stay to watch over the brood.  The size is nearly\r\nthat of a Hen's egg.  The cabin is open at either end.  The\r\nfront-entrance broadens into a gallery; the back-entrance tapers into a\r\nfunnel-neck.  I fail to see the object of this neck.  As for the opening\r\nin front, which is wider, this is, beyond a doubt, a victualling-door.  I\r\nsee the Spider, at intervals, standing here on the look-out for the\r\nLocust, whom she consumes outside, taking care not to soil the spotless\r\nsanctuary with corpses.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the nest is not without a certain similarity to that of\r\nthe home occupied during the hunting-season.  The passage at the back\r\nrepresents the funnel-neck, that ran almost down to the ground and\r\nafforded an outlet for flight in case of grave danger.  The one in front,\r\nexpanding into a mouth kept wide open by cords stretched backwards and\r\nforwards, recalls the yawning gulf into which the victims used to fall.\r\nEvery part of the old dwelling is repeated: even the labyrinth, though\r\nthis, it is true, is on a much smaller scale.  In front of the\r\nbell-shaped mouth is a tangle of threads wherein the passers-by are\r\ncaught.  Each species, in this way, possesses a primary architectural\r\nmodel which is followed as a whole, in spite of altered conditions.  The\r\nanimal knows its trade thoroughly, but it does not know and will never\r\nknow aught else, being incapable of originality.\r\n\r\nNow this palace of silk, when all is said, is nothing more than a guard-\r\nhouse.  Behind the soft, milky opalescence of the wall glimmers the egg-\r\ntabernacle, with its form vaguely suggesting the star of some order of\r\nknighthood.  It is a large pocket, of a splendid dead-white, isolated on\r\nevery side by radiating pillars which keep it motionless in the centre of\r\nthe tapestry.  These pillars are about ten in number and are slender in\r\nthe middle, expanding at one end into a conical capital and at the other\r\ninto a base of the same shape.  They face one another and mark the\r\nposition of the vaulted corridors which allow free movement in every\r\ndirection around the central chamber.  The mother walks gravely to and\r\nfro under the arches of her cloisters, she stops first here, then there;\r\nshe makes a lengthy auscultation of the egg-wallet; she listens to all\r\nthat happens inside the satin wrapper.  To disturb her would be\r\nbarbarous.\r\n\r\nFor a closer examination, let us use the dilapidated nests which we\r\nbrought from the fields.  Apart from its pillars, the egg-pocket is an\r\ninverted conoid, reminding us of the work of the Silky Epeira.  Its\r\nmaterial is rather stout; my pincers, pulling at it, do not tear it\r\nwithout difficulty.  Inside the bag there is nothing but an extremely\r\nfine, white wadding and, lastly, the eggs, numbering about a hundred and\r\ncomparatively large, for they measure a millimetre and a half. {37}  They\r\nare very pale amber-yellow beads, which do not stick together and which\r\nroll freely as soon as I remove the swan's-down shroud.  Let us put\r\neverything into a glass-tube to study the hatching.\r\n\r\nWe will now retrace our steps a little.  When laying-time comes, the\r\nmother forsakes her dwelling, her crater into which her falling victims\r\ndropped, her labyrinth in which the flight of the Midges was cut short;\r\nshe leaves intact the apparatus that enabled her to live at her ease.\r\nThoughtful of her natural duties, she goes to found another establishment\r\nat a distance.  Why at a distance?\r\n\r\nShe has still a few long months to live and she needs nourishment.  Were\r\nit not better, then, to lodge the eggs in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthe present home and to continue her hunting with the excellent snare at\r\nher disposal?  The watching of the nest and the easy acquisition of\r\nprovender would go hand in hand.  The Spider is of another opinion; and I\r\nsuspect the reason.\r\n\r\nThe sheet-net and the labyrinth that surmounts it are objects visible\r\nfrom afar, owing to their whiteness and the height whereat they are\r\nplaced.  Their scintillation in the sun, in frequented paths, attracts\r\nMosquitoes and Butterflies, like the lamps in our rooms and the fowler's\r\nlooking-glass.  Whoso comes to look at the bright thing too closely dies\r\nthe victim of his curiosity.  There is nothing better for playing upon\r\nthe folly of the passer-by, but also nothing more dangerous to the safety\r\nof the family.\r\n\r\nHarpies will not fail to come running at this signal, showing up against\r\nthe green; guided by the position of the web, they will assuredly find\r\nthe precious purse; and a strange grub, feasting on a hundred new-laid\r\neggs, will ruin the establishment.  I do not know these enemies, not\r\nhaving sufficient materials at my disposal for a register of the\r\nparasites; but, from indications gathered elsewhere, I suspect them.\r\n\r\nThe Banded Epeira, trusting to the strength of her stuff, fixes her nest\r\nin the sight of all, hangs it on the brushwood, taking no precautions\r\nwhatever to hide it.  And a bad business it proves for her.  Her jar\r\nprovides me with an Ichneumon {38} possessed of the inoculating larding-\r\npin: a _Cryptus_ who, as a grub, had fed on Spiders' eggs.  Nothing but\r\nempty shells was left inside the central keg; the germs were completely\r\nexterminated.  There are other Ichneumon-flies, moreover, addicted to\r\nrobbing Spiders' nests; a basket of fresh eggs is their offspring's\r\nregular food.\r\n\r\nLike any other, the Labyrinth Spider dreads the scoundrelly advent of the\r\npickwallet; she provides for it and, to shield herself against it as far\r\nas possible, chooses a hiding-place outside her dwelling, far removed\r\nfrom the tell-tale web.  When she feels her ovaries ripen, she shifts her\r\nquarters; she goes off at night to explore the neighbourhood and seek a\r\nless dangerous refuge.  The points selected are, by preference, the low\r\nbrambles dragging along the ground, keeping their dense verdure during\r\nthe winter and crammed with dead leaves from the oaks hard by.  Rosemary-\r\ntufts, which gain in thickness what they lose in height on the\r\nunfostering rock, suit her particularly.  This is where I usually find\r\nher nest, not without long seeking, so well is it hidden.\r\n\r\nSo far, there is no departure from current usage.  As the world is full\r\nof creatures on the prowl for tender mouthfuls, every mother has her\r\napprehensions; she also has her natural wisdom, which advises her to\r\nestablish her family in secret places.  Very few neglect this precaution;\r\neach, in her own manner, conceals the eggs she lays.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Labyrinth Spider, the protection of the brood is\r\ncomplicated by another condition.  In the vast majority of instances, the\r\neggs, once lodged in a favourable spot, are abandoned to themselves, left\r\nto the chances of good or ill fortune.  The Spider of the brushwood, on\r\nthe contrary, endowed with greater maternal devotion, has, like the Crab\r\nSpider, to mount guard over hers until they hatch.\r\n\r\nWith a few threads and some small leaves joined together, the Crab Spider\r\nbuilds, above her lofty nest, a rudimentary watch-tower where she stays\r\npermanently, greatly emaciated, flattened into a sort of wrinkled shell\r\nthrough the emptying of her ovaries and the total absence of food.  And\r\nthis mere shred, hardly more than a skin that persists in living without\r\neating, stoutly defends her egg-sack, shows fight at the approach of any\r\ntramp.  She does not make up her mind to die until the little ones are\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nThe Labyrinth Spider is better treated.  After laying her eggs, so far\r\nfrom becoming thin, she preserves an excellent appearance and a round\r\nbelly.  Moreover, she does not lose her appetite and is always prepared\r\nto bleed a Locust.  She therefore requires a dwelling with a hunting-box\r\nclose to the eggs watched over.  We know this dwelling, built in strict\r\naccordance with artistic canons under the shelter of my cages.\r\n\r\nRemember the magnificent oval guard-room, running into a vestibule at\r\neither end; the egg-chamber slung in the centre and isolated on every\r\nside by half a score of pillars; the front-hall expanding into a wide\r\nmouth and surmounted by a network of taut threads forming a trap.  The\r\nsemi-transparency of the walls allows us to see the Spider engaged in her\r\nhousehold affairs.  Her cloister of vaulted passages enables her to\r\nproceed to any point of the star-shaped pouch containing the eggs.\r\nIndefatigable in her rounds, she stops here and there; she fondly feels\r\nthe satin, listens to the secrets of the wallet.  If I shake the net at\r\nany point with a straw, she quickly runs up to enquire what is happening.\r\nWill this vigilance frighten off the Ichneumon and other lovers of\r\nomelettes?  Perhaps so.  But, though this danger be averted, others will\r\ncome when the mother is no longer there.\r\n\r\nHer attentive watch does not make her overlook her meals.  One of the\r\nLocusts whereof I renew the supply at intervals in the cages is caught in\r\nthe cords of the great entrance-hall.  The Spider arrives hurriedly,\r\nsnatches the giddy-pate and disjoints his shanks, which she empties of\r\ntheir contents, the best part of the insect.  The remainder of the\r\ncarcass is afterwards drained more or less, according to her appetite at\r\nthe time.  The meal is taken outside the guard-room, on the threshold,\r\nnever indoors.\r\n\r\nThese are not capricious mouthfuls, serving to beguile the boredom of the\r\nwatch for a brief while; they are substantial repasts, which require\r\nseveral sittings.  Such an appetite astonishes me, after I have seen the\r\nCrab Spider, that no less ardent watcher, refuse the Bees whom I give her\r\nand allow herself to die of inanition.  Can this other mother have so\r\ngreat a need as that to eat?  Yes, certainly she has; and for an\r\nimperative reason.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of her work, she spent a large amount of silk, perhaps\r\nall that her reserves contained; for the double dwelling--for herself and\r\nfor her offspring--is a huge edifice, exceedingly costly in materials;\r\nand yet, for nearly another month, I see her adding layer upon layer both\r\nto the wall of the large cabin and to that of the central chamber, so\r\nmuch so that the texture, which at first was translucent gauze, becomes\r\nopaque satin.  The walls never seem thick enough; the Spider is always\r\nworking at them.  To satisfy this lavish expenditure, she must\r\nincessantly, by means of feeding, fill her silk-glands as and when she\r\nempties them by spinning.  Food is the means whereby she keeps the\r\ninexhaustible factory going.\r\n\r\nA month passes and, about the middle of September, the little ones hatch,\r\nbut without leaving their tabernacle, where they are to spend the winter\r\npacked in soft wadding.  The mother continues to watch and spin,\r\nlessening her activity from day to day.  She recruits herself with a\r\nLocust at longer intervals; she sometimes scorns those whom I myself\r\nentangle in her trap.  This increasing abstemiousness, a sign of\r\ndecrepitude, slackens and at last stops the work of the spinnerets.\r\n\r\nFor four or five weeks longer, the mother never ceases her leisurely\r\ninspection-rounds, happy at hearing the new-born Spiders swarming in the\r\nwallet.  At length, when October ends, she clutches her offspring's\r\nnursery and dies withered.  She has done all that maternal devotion can\r\ndo; the special providence of tiny animals will do the rest.  When spring\r\ncomes, the youngsters will emerge from their snug habitation, disperse\r\nall over the neighbourhood by the expedient of the floating thread and\r\nweave their first attempts at a labyrinth on the tufts of thyme.\r\n\r\nAccurate in structure and neat in silk-work though they be, the nests of\r\nthe caged captives do not tell us everything; we must go back to what\r\nhappens in the fields, with their complicated conditions.  Towards the\r\nend of December, I again set out in search, aided by all my youthful\r\ncollaborators.  We inspect the stunted rosemaries along the edge of a\r\npath sheltered by a rocky, wooded slope; we lift the branches that spread\r\nover the ground.  Our zeal is rewarded with success.  In a couple of\r\nhours, I am the owner of some nests.\r\n\r\nPitiful pieces of work are they, injured beyond recognition by the\r\nassaults of the weather!  It needs the eyes of faith to see in these\r\nruins the equivalent of the edifices built inside my cages.  Fastened to\r\nthe creeping branch, the unsightly bundle lies on the sand heaped up by\r\nthe rains.  Oak-leaves, roughly joined by a few threads, wrap it all\r\nround.  One of these leaves, larger than the others, roofs it in and\r\nserves as a scaffolding for the whole of the ceiling.  If we did not see\r\nthe silky remnants of the two vestibules projecting and feel a certain\r\nresistance when separating the parts of the bundle, we might take the\r\nthing for a casual accumulation, the work of the rain and the wind.\r\n\r\nLet us examine our find and look more closely into its shapelessness.\r\nHere is the large room, the maternal cabin, which rips as the coating of\r\nleaves is removed; here are the circular galleries of the guard-room;\r\nhere are the central chamber and its pillars, all in a fabric of\r\nimmaculate white.  The dirt from the damp ground has not penetrated to\r\nthis dwelling protected by its wrapper of dead leaves.\r\n\r\nNow open the habitation of the offspring.  What is this?  To my utter\r\nastonishment, the contents of the chamber are a kernel of earthy matters,\r\nas though the muddy rain-water had been allowed to soak through.  Put\r\naside that idea, says the satin wall, which itself is perfectly clean\r\ninside.  It is most certainly the mother's doing, a deliberate piece of\r\nwork, executed with minute care.  The grains of sand are stuck together\r\nwith a cement of silk; and the whole resists the pressure of the fingers.\r\n\r\nIf we continue to unshell the kernel, we find, below this mineral layer,\r\na last silken tunic that forms a globe around the brood.  No sooner do we\r\ntear this final covering than the frightened little ones run away and\r\nscatter with an agility that is singular at this cold and torpid season.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, when working in the natural state, the Labyrinth Spider builds\r\naround the eggs, between two sheets of satin, a wall composed of a great\r\ndeal of sand and a little silk.  To stop the Ichneumon's probe and the\r\nteeth of the other ravagers, the best thing that occurred to her was this\r\nhoarding which combines the hardness of flint with the softness of\r\nmuslin.\r\n\r\nThis means of defence seems to be pretty frequent among Spiders.  Our own\r\nbig House Spider, _Tegenaria domestica_, encloses her eggs in a globule\r\nstrengthened with a rind of silk and of crumbly wreckage from the mortar\r\nof the walls.  Other species, living in the open under stones, work in\r\nthe same way.  They wrap their eggs in a mineral shell held together with\r\nsilk.  The same fears have inspired the same protective methods.\r\n\r\nThen how comes it that, of the five mothers reared in my cages, not one\r\nhas had recourse to the clay rampart?  After all, sand abounded: the pans\r\nin which the wire-gauze covers stood were full of it.  On the other hand,\r\nunder normal conditions, I have often come across nests without any\r\nmineral casing.  These incomplete nests were placed at some height from\r\nthe ground, in the thick of the brushwood; the others, on the contrary,\r\nthose supplied with a coating of sand, lay on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe method of the work explains these differences.  The concrete of our\r\nbuildings is obtained by the simultaneous manipulation of gravel and\r\nmortar.  In the same way, the Spider mixes the cement of the silk with\r\nthe grains of sand; the spinnerets never cease working, while the legs\r\nfling under the adhesive spray the solid materials collected in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood.  The operation would be impossible if, after\r\ncementing each grain of sand, it were necessary to stop the work of the\r\nspinnerets and go to a distance to fetch further stony elements.  Those\r\nmaterials have to be right under her legs; otherwise the Spider does\r\nwithout and continues her work just the same.\r\n\r\nIn my cages, the sand is too far off.  To obtain it, the Spider would\r\nhave to leave the top of the dome, where the nest is being built on its\r\ntrellis-work support; she would have to come down some nine inches.  The\r\nworker refuses to take this trouble, which, if repeated in the case of\r\neach grain, would make the action of the spinnerets too irksome.  She\r\nalso refuses to do so when, for reasons which I have not fathomed, the\r\nsite chosen is some way up in the tuft of rosemary.  But, when the nest\r\ntouches the ground, the clay rampart is never missing.\r\n\r\nAre we to see in this fact proof of an instinct capable of modification,\r\neither making for decadence and gradually neglecting what was the\r\nancestors' safeguard, or making for progress and advancing, hesitatingly,\r\ntowards perfection in the mason's art?  No inference is permissible in\r\neither direction.  The Labyrinth Spider has simply taught us that\r\ninstinct possesses resources which are employed or left latent according\r\nto the conditions of the moment.  Place sand under her legs and the\r\nspinstress will knead concrete; refuse her that sand, or put it out of\r\nher reach, and the Spider will remain a simple silk-worker, always ready,\r\nhowever, to turn mason under favourable conditions.  The aggregate of\r\nthings that come within the observer's scope proves that it were mad to\r\nexpect from her any further innovations, such as would utterly change her\r\nmethods of manufacture and cause her, for instance, to abandon her cabin,\r\nwith its two entrance-halls and its star-like tabernacle, in favour of\r\nthe Banded Epeira's pear-shaped gourd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI: THE CLOTHO SPIDER\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is named Durand's Clotho (_Clotho Durandi_, LATR.), in memory of him\r\nwho first called attention to this particular Spider.  To enter on\r\neternity under the safe-conduct of a diminutive animal which saves us\r\nfrom speedy oblivion under the mallows and rockets is no contemptible\r\nadvantage.  Most men disappear without leaving an echo to repeat their\r\nname; they lie buried in forgetfulness, the worst of graves.\r\n\r\nOthers, among the naturalists, benefit by the designation given to this\r\nor that object in life's treasure-house: it is the skiff wherein they\r\nkeep afloat for a brief while.  A patch of lichen on the bark of an old\r\ntree, a blade of grass, a puny beastie: any one of these hands down a\r\nman's name to posterity as effectively as a new comet.  For all its\r\nabuses, this manner of honouring the departed is eminently respectable.\r\nIf we would carve an epitaph of some duration, what could we find better\r\nthan a Beetle's wing-case, a Snail's shell or a Spider's web?  Granite is\r\nworth none of them.  Entrusted to the hard stone, an inscription becomes\r\nobliterated; entrusted to a Butterfly's wing, it is indestructible.\r\n'Durand,' therefore, by all means.\r\n\r\nBut why drag in 'Clotho'?  Is it the whim of a nomenclator, at a loss for\r\nwords to denote the ever-swelling tide of beasts that require\r\ncataloguing?  Not entirely.  A mythological name came to his mind, one\r\nwhich sounded well and which, moreover, was not out of place in\r\ndesignating a spinstress.  The Clotho of antiquity is the youngest of the\r\nthree Fates; she holds the distaff whence our destinies are spun, a\r\ndistaff wound with plenty of rough flocks, just a few shreds of silk and,\r\nvery rarely, a thin strand of gold.\r\n\r\nPrettily shaped and clad, as far as a Spider can be, the Clotho of the\r\nnaturalists is, above all, a highly talented spinstress; and this is the\r\nreason why she is called after the distaff-bearing deity of the infernal\r\nregions.  It is a pity that the analogy extends no further.  The\r\nmythological Clotho, niggardly with her silk and lavish with her coarse\r\nflocks, spins us a harsh existence; the eight-legged Clotho uses naught\r\nbut exquisite silk.  She works for herself; the other works for us, who\r\nare hardly worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nWould we make her acquaintance?  On the rocky slopes in the oliveland,\r\nscorched and blistered by the sun, turn over the flat stones, those of a\r\nfair size; search, above all, the piles which the shepherds set up for a\r\nseat whence to watch the sheep browsing amongst the lavender below.  Do\r\nnot be too easily disheartened: the Clotho is rare; not every spot suits\r\nher.  If fortune smile at last upon our perseverance, we shall see,\r\nclinging to the lower surface of the stone which we have lifted, an\r\nedifice of a weather-beaten aspect, shaped like an over-turned cupola and\r\nabout the size of half a tangerine orange.  The outside is encrusted or\r\nhung with small shells, particles of earth and, especially, dried\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the cupola is scalloped into a dozen angular lobes, the\r\npoints of which spread and are fixed to the stone.  In between these\r\nstraps is the same number of spacious inverted arches.  The whole\r\nrepresents the Ishmaelite's camel-hair tent, but upside down.  A flat\r\nroof, stretched between the straps, closes the top of the dwelling.\r\n\r\nThen where is the entrance?  All the arches of the edge open upon the\r\nroof; not one leads to the interior.  The eye seeks in vain; there is\r\nnothing to point to a passage between the inside and the outside.  Yet\r\nthe owner of the house must go out from time to time, were it only in\r\nsearch of food; on returning from her expedition, she must go in again.\r\nHow does she make her exits and her entrances?  A straw will tell us the\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nPass it over the threshold of the various arches.  Everywhere, the\r\nsearching straw encounters resistance; everywhere, it finds the place\r\nrigorously closed.  But one of the scallops, differing in no wise from\r\nthe others in appearance, if cleverly coaxed, opens at the edge into two\r\nlips and stands slightly ajar.  This is the door, which at once shuts\r\nagain of its own elasticity.  Nor is this all: the Spider, when she\r\nreturns home, often bolts herself in, that is to say, she joins and\r\nfastens the two leaves of the door with a little silk.\r\n\r\nThe Mason Mygale is no safer in her burrow, with its lid\r\nundistinguishable from the soil and moving on a hinge, than is the Clotho\r\nin her tent, which is inviolable by any enemy ignorant of the device.  The\r\nClotho, when in danger, runs quickly home; she opens the chink with a\r\ntouch of her claw, enters and disappears.  The door closes of itself and\r\nis supplied, in case of need, with a lock consisting of a few threads.  No\r\nburglar, led astray by the multiplicity of arches, one and all alike,\r\nwill ever discover how the fugitive vanished so suddenly.\r\n\r\nWhile the Clotho displays a more simple ingenuity as regards her\r\ndefensive machinery, she is incomparably ahead of the Mygale in the\r\nmatter of domestic comfort.  Let us open her cabin.  What luxury!  We are\r\ntaught how a Sybarite of old was unable to rest, owing to the presence of\r\na crumpled rose-leaf in his bed.  The Clotho is quite as fastidious.  Her\r\ncouch is more delicate than swan's-down and whiter than the fleece of the\r\nclouds where brood the summer storms.  It is the ideal blanket.  Above is\r\na canopy or tester of equal softness.  Between the two nestles the\r\nSpider, short-legged, clad in sombre garments, with five yellow favours\r\non her back.\r\n\r\nRest in this exquisite retreat demands perfect stability, especially on\r\ngusty days, when sharp draughts penetrate beneath the stone.  This\r\ncondition is admirably fulfilled.  Take a careful look at the habitation.\r\nThe arches that gird the roof with a balustrade and bear the weight of\r\nthe edifice are fixed to the slab by their extremities.  Moreover, from\r\neach point of contact, there issues a cluster of diverging threads that\r\ncreep along the stone and cling to it throughout their length, which\r\nspreads afar.  I have measured some fully nine inches long.  These are so\r\nmany cables; they represent the ropes and pegs that hold the Arab's tent\r\nin position.  With such supports as these, so numerous and so\r\nmethodically arranged, the hammock cannot be torn from its bearings save\r\nby the intervention of brutal methods with which the Spider need not\r\nconcern herself, so seldom do they occur.\r\n\r\nAnother detail attracts our attention: whereas the interior of the house\r\nis exquisitely clean, the outside is covered with dirt, bits of earth,\r\nchips of rotten wood, little pieces of gravel.  Often there are worse\r\nthings still: the exterior of the tent becomes a charnel-house.  Here,\r\nhung up or embedded, are the dry carcasses of Opatra, Asidae and other\r\nTenebrionidae {39} that favour underrock shelters; segments of Iuli, {40}\r\nbleached by the sun; shells of Pupae, {41} common among the stones; and,\r\nlastly, Snail-shells, selected from among the smallest.\r\n\r\nThese relics are obviously, for the most part, table-leavings, broken\r\nvictuals.  Unversed in the trapper's art, the Clotho courses her game and\r\nlives upon the vagrants who wander from one stone to another.  Whoso\r\nventures under the slab at night is strangled by the hostess; and the\r\ndried-up carcass, instead of being flung to a distance, is hung to the\r\nsilken wall, as though the Spider wished to make a bogey-house of her\r\nhome.  But this cannot be her aim.  To act like the ogre who hangs his\r\nvictims from the castle battlements is the worst way to disarm suspicion\r\nin the passers-by whom you are lying in wait to capture.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons which increase our doubts.  The shells hung up\r\nare most often empty; but there are also some occupied by the Snail,\r\nalive and untouched.  What can the Clotho do with a _Pupa cinerea_, a\r\n_Pupa quadridens_ and other narrow spirals wherein the animal retreats to\r\nan inaccessible depth?  The Spider is incapable of breaking the\r\ncalcareous shell or of getting at the hermit through the opening.  Then\r\nwhy should she collect those prizes, whose slimy flesh is probably not to\r\nher taste?  We begin to suspect a simple question of ballast and balance.\r\nThe House Spider, or _Tegenaria domestica_, prevents her web, spun in a\r\ncorner of the wall, from losing its shape at the least breath of air, by\r\nloading it with crumbling plaster and allowing tiny fragments of mortar\r\nto accumulate.  Are we face to face with a similar process?  Let us try\r\nexperiment, which is preferable to any amount of conjecture.\r\n\r\nTo rear the Clotho is not an arduous undertaking; we are not obliged to\r\ntake the heavy flagstone, on which the dwelling is built, away with us.  A\r\nvery simple operation suffices.  I loosen the fastenings with my pocket-\r\nknife.  The Spider has such stay-at-home ways that she very rarely makes\r\noff.  Besides, I use the utmost discretion in my rape of the house.  And\r\nso I carry away the building, together with its owner, in a paper bag.\r\n\r\nThe flat stones, which are too heavy to move and which would occupy too\r\nmuch room upon my table, are replaced either by deal disks, which once\r\nformed part of cheese-boxes, or by round pieces of cardboard.  I arrange\r\neach silken hammock under one of these by itself, fastening the angular\r\nprojections, one by one, with strips of gummed paper.  The whole stands\r\non three short pillars and gives a very fair imitation of the underrock\r\nshelter in the form of a small dolmen.  Throughout this operation, if you\r\nare careful to avoid shocks and jolts, the Spider remains indoors.\r\nFinally, each apparatus is placed under a wire-gauze, bell-shaped cage,\r\nwhich stands in a dish filled with sand.\r\n\r\nWe can have an answer by the next morning.  If, among the cabins swung\r\nfrom the ceilings of the deal or cardboard dolmens, there be one that is\r\nall dilapidated, that was seriously knocked out of shape at the time of\r\nremoval, the Spider abandons it during the night and instals herself\r\nelsewhere, sometimes even on the trellis-work of the wire cage.\r\n\r\nThe new tent, the work of a few hours, attains hardly the diameter of a\r\ntwo-franc piece.  It is built, however, on the same principles as the old\r\nmanor-house and consists of two thin sheets laid one above the other, the\r\nupper one flat and forming a tester, the lower curved and pocket-shaped.\r\nThe texture is extremely delicate: the least trifle would deform it, to\r\nthe detriment of the available space, which is already much reduced and\r\nonly just sufficient for the recluse.\r\n\r\nWell, what has the Spider done to keep the gossamer stretched, to steady\r\nit and to make it retain its greatest capacity?  Exactly what our static\r\ntreatises would advise her to do: she has ballasted her structure, she\r\nhas done her best to lower its centre of gravity.  From the convex\r\nsurface of the pocket hang long chaplets of grains of sand strung\r\ntogether with slender silken cords.  To these sandy stalactites, which\r\nform a bushy beard, are added a few heavy lumps hung separately and lower\r\ndown, at the end of a thread.  The whole is a piece of ballast-work, an\r\napparatus for ensuring equilibrium and tension.\r\n\r\nThe present edifice, hastily constructed in the space of a night, is the\r\nfrail rough sketch of what the home will afterwards become.  Successive\r\nlayers will be added to it; and the partition-wall will grow into a thick\r\nblanket capable of partly retaining, by its own weight, the requisite\r\ncurve and capacity.  The Spider now abandons the stalactites of sand,\r\nwhich were used to keep the original pocket stretched, and confines\r\nherself to dumping down on her abode any more or less heavy object,\r\nmainly corpses of insects, because she need not look for these and finds\r\nthem ready to hand after each meal.  They are weights, not trophies; they\r\ntake the place of materials that must otherwise be collected from a\r\ndistance and hoisted to the top.  In this way, a breastwork is obtained\r\nthat strengthens and steadies the house.  Additional equilibrium is often\r\nsupplied by tiny shells and other objects hanging a long way down.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen if one robbed an old dwelling, long since completed, of\r\nits outer covering?  In case of such a disaster, would the Spider go back\r\nto the sandy stalactites, as a ready means of restoring stability?  This\r\nis easily ascertained.  In my hamlets under wire, I select a fair-sized\r\ncabin.  I strip the exterior, carefully removing any foreign body.  The\r\nsilk reappears in its original whiteness.  The tent looks magnificent,\r\nbut seems to me too limp.\r\n\r\nThis is also the Spider's opinion.  She sets to work, next evening, to\r\nput things right.  And how?  Once more with hanging strings of sand.  In\r\na few nights, the silk bag bristles with a long, thick beard of\r\nstalactites, a curious piece of work, excellently adapted to maintain the\r\nweb in an unvaried curve.  Even so are the cables of a suspension-bridge\r\nsteadied by the weight of the superstructure.\r\n\r\nLater, as the Spider goes on feeding, the remains of the victuals are\r\nembedded in the wall, the sand is shaken and gradually drops away and the\r\nhome resumes its charnel-house appearance.  This brings us to the same\r\nconclusion as before: the Clotho knows her statics; by means of\r\nadditional weights, she is able to lower the centre of gravity and thus\r\nto give her dwelling the proper equilibrium and capacity.\r\n\r\nNow what does she do in her softly-wadded home?  Nothing, that I know of.\r\nWith a full stomach, her legs luxuriously stretched over the downy\r\ncarpet, she does nothing, thinks of nothing; she listens to the sound of\r\nearth revolving on its axis.  It is not sleep, still less is it waking;\r\nit is a middle state where naught prevails save a dreamy consciousness of\r\nwell-being.  We ourselves, when comfortably in bed, enjoy, just before we\r\nfall asleep, a few moments of bliss, the prelude to cessation of thought\r\nand its train of worries; and those moments are among the sweetest in our\r\nlives.  The Clotho seems to know similar moments and to make the most of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf I push open the door of the cabin, invariably I find the Spider lying\r\nmotionless, as though in endless meditation.  It needs the teasing of a\r\nstraw to rouse her from her apathy.  It needs the prick of hunger to\r\nbring her out of doors; and, as she is extremely temperate, her\r\nappearances outside are few and far between.  During three years of\r\nassiduous observation, in the privacy of my study, I have not once seen\r\nher explore the domain of the wire cage by day.  Not until a late hour at\r\nnight does she venture forth in quest of victuals; and it is hardly\r\nfeasible to follow her on her excursions.\r\n\r\nPatience once enabled me to find her, at ten o'clock in the evening,\r\ntaking the air on the flat roof of her house, where she was doubtless\r\nwaiting for the game to pass.  Startled by the light of my candle, the\r\nlover of darkness at once returned indoors, refusing to reveal any of her\r\nsecrets.  Only, next day, there was one more corpse hanging from the wall\r\nof the cabin, a proof that the chase was successfully resumed after my\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThe Clotho, who is not only nocturnal, but also excessively shy, conceals\r\nher habits from us; she shows us her works, those precious historical\r\ndocuments, but hides her actions, especially the laying, which I estimate\r\napproximately to take place in October.  The sum total of the eggs is\r\ndivided into five or six small, flat, lentiform pockets, which, taken\r\ntogether, occupy the greater part of the maternal home.  These capsules\r\nhave each their own partition-wall of superb white satin, but they are so\r\nclosely soldered, both together and to the floor of the house, that it is\r\nimpossible to part them without tearing them, impossible, therefore, to\r\nobtain them separately.  The eggs in all amount to about a hundred.\r\n\r\nThe mother sits upon the heap of pockets with the same devotion as a\r\nbrooding hen.  Maternity has not withered her.  Although decreased in\r\nbulk, she retains an excellent look of health; her round belly and her\r\nwell-stretched skin tell us from the first that her part is not yet\r\nwholly played.\r\n\r\nThe hatching takes place early.  November has not arrived before the\r\npockets contain the young: wee things clad in black, with five yellow\r\nspecks, exactly like their elders.  The new-born do not leave their\r\nrespective nurseries.  Packed close together, they spend the whole of the\r\nwintry season there, while the mother, squatting on the pile of cells,\r\nwatches over the general safety, without knowing her family other than by\r\nthe gentle trepidations felt through the partitions of the tiny chambers.\r\nThe Labyrinth Spider has shown us how she maintains a permanent sitting\r\nfor two months in her guard-room, to defend, in case of need, the brood\r\nwhich she will never see.  The Clotho does the same during eight months,\r\nthus earning the right to set eyes for a little while on her family\r\ntrotting around her in the main cabin and to assist at the final exodus,\r\nthe great journey undertaken at the end of a thread.\r\n\r\nWhen the summer heat arrives, in June, the young ones, probably aided by\r\ntheir mother, pierce the walls of their cells, leave the maternal tent,\r\nof which they know the secret outlet well, take the air on the threshold\r\nfor a few hours and then fly away, carried to some distance by a\r\nfunicular aeroplane, the first product of their spinning-mill.\r\n\r\nThe elder Clotho remains behind, careless of this emigration which leaves\r\nher alone.  She is far from being faded indeed, she looks younger than\r\never.  Her fresh colour, her robust appearance suggest great length of\r\nlife, capable of producing a second family.  On this subject I have but\r\none document, a pretty far-reaching one, however.  There were a few\r\nmothers whose actions I had the patience to watch, despite the wearisome\r\nminutiae of the rearing and the slowness of the result.  These abandoned\r\ntheir dwellings after the departure of their young; and each went to\r\nweave a new one for herself on the wire net-work of the cage.\r\n\r\nThey were rough-and-ready summaries, the work of a night.  Two hangings,\r\none above the other, the upper one flat, the lower concave and ballasted\r\nwith stalactites of grains of sand, formed the new home, which,\r\nstrengthened daily by fresh layers, promised to become similar to the old\r\none.  Why does the Spider desert her former mansion, which is in no way\r\ndilapidated--far from it--and still exceedingly serviceable, as far as\r\none can judge?  Unless I am mistaken, I think I have an inkling of the\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThe old cabin, comfortably wadded though it be, possesses serious\r\ndisadvantages: it is littered with the ruins of the children's nurseries.\r\nThese ruins are so close-welded to the rest of the home that my forceps\r\ncannot extract them without difficulty; and to remove them would be an\r\nexhausting business for the Clotho and possibly beyond her strength.  It\r\nis a case of the resistance of Gordian knots, which not even the very\r\nspinstress who fastened them is capable of untying.  The encumbering\r\nlitter, therefore, will remain.\r\n\r\nIf the Spider were to stay alone, the reduction of space, when all is\r\nsaid, would hardly matter to her: she wants so little room, merely enough\r\nto move in!  Besides, when you have spent seven or eight months in the\r\ncramping presence of those bedchambers, what can be the reason of a\r\nsudden need for greater space?  I see but one: the Spider requires a\r\nroomy habitation, not for herself--she is satisfied with the smallest\r\nden--but for a second family.  Where is she to place the pockets of eggs,\r\nif the ruins of the previous laying remain in the way?  A new brood\r\nrequires a new home.  That, no doubt, is why, feeling that her ovaries\r\nare not yet dried up, the Spider shifts her quarters and founds a new\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe facts observed are confined to this change of dwelling.  I regret\r\nthat other interests and the difficulties attendant upon a long\r\nupbringing did not allow me to pursue the question and definitely to\r\nsettle the matter of the repeated layings and the longevity of the\r\nClotho, as I did in that of the Lycosa.\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of this Spider, let us glance at a curious problem\r\nwhich has already been set by the Lycosa's offspring.  When carried for\r\nseven months on the mother's back, they keep in training as agile\r\ngymnasts without taking any nourishment.  It is a familiar exercise for\r\nthem, after a fall, which frequently occurs, to scramble up a leg of\r\ntheir mount and nimbly to resume their place in the saddle.  They expend\r\nenergy without receiving any material sustenance.\r\n\r\nThe sons of the Clotho, the Labyrinth Spider and many others confront us\r\nwith the same riddle: they move, yet do not eat.  At any period of the\r\nnursery stage, even in the heart of winter, on the bleak days of January,\r\nI tear the pockets of the one and the tabernacle of the other, expecting\r\nto find the swarm of youngsters lying in a state of complete inertia,\r\nnumbed by the cold and by lack of food.  Well, the result is quite\r\ndifferent.  The instant their cells are broken open, the anchorites run\r\nout and flee in every direction as nimbly as at the best moments of their\r\nnormal liberty.  It is marvellous to see them scampering about.  No brood\r\nof Partridges, stumbled upon by a Dog, scatters more promptly.\r\n\r\nChicks, while still no more than tiny balls of yellow fluff, hasten up at\r\nthe mother's call and scurry towards the plate of rice.  Habit has made\r\nus indifferent to the spectacle of those pretty little animal machines,\r\nwhich work so nimbly and with such precision; we pay no attention, so\r\nsimple does it all appear to us.  Science examines and looks at things\r\ndifferently.  She says to herself:\r\n\r\n'Nothing is made with nothing.  The chick feeds itself; it consumes or\r\nrather it assimilates and turns the food into heat, which is converted\r\ninto energy.'\r\n\r\nWere any one to tell us of a chick which, for seven or eight months on\r\nend, kept itself in condition for running, always fit, always brisk,\r\nwithout taking the least beakful of nourishment from the day when it left\r\nthe egg, we could find no words strong enough to express our incredulity.\r\nNow this paradox of activity maintained without the stay of food is\r\nrealized by the Clotho Spider and others.\r\n\r\nI believe I have made it sufficiently clear that the young Lycosae take\r\nno food as long as they remain with their mother.  Strictly speaking,\r\ndoubt is just admissible, for observation is needs dumb as to what may\r\nhappen earlier or later within the mysteries of the burrow.  It seems\r\npossible that the repleted mother may there disgorge to her family a mite\r\nof the contents of her crop.  To this suggestion the Clotho undertakes to\r\nmake reply.\r\n\r\nLike the Lycosa, she lives with her family; but the Clotho is separated\r\nfrom them by the walls of the cells in which the little ones are\r\nhermetically enclosed.  In this condition, the transmission of solid\r\nnourishment becomes impossible.  Should any one entertain a theory of\r\nnutritive humours cast up by the mother and filtering through the\r\npartitions at which the prisoners might come and drink, the Labyrinth\r\nSpider would at once dispel the idea.  She dies a few weeks after her\r\nyoung are hatched; and the children, still locked in their satin\r\nbed-chamber for the best part of the year, are none the less active.\r\n\r\nCan it be that they derive sustenance from the silken wrapper?  Do they\r\neat their house?  The supposition is not absurd, for we have seen the\r\nEpeirae, before beginning a new web, swallow the ruins of the old.  But\r\nthe explanation cannot be accepted, as we learn from the Lycosa, whose\r\nfamily boasts no silky screen.  In short, it is certain that the young,\r\nof whatever species, take absolutely no nourishment.\r\n\r\nLastly, we wonder whether they may possess within themselves reserves\r\nthat come from the egg, fatty or other matters the gradual combustion of\r\nwhich would be transformed into mechanical force.  If the expenditure of\r\nenergy were of but short duration, a few hours or a few days, we could\r\ngladly welcome this idea of a motor viaticum, the attribute of every\r\ncreature born into the world.  The chick possesses it in a high degree:\r\nit is steady on its legs, it moves for a little while with the sole aid\r\nof the food wherewith the egg furnishes it; but soon, if the stomach is\r\nnot kept supplied, the centre of energy becomes extinct and the bird\r\ndies.  How would the chick fare if it were expected, for seven or eight\r\nmonths without stopping, to stand on its feet, to run about, to flee in\r\nthe face of danger?  Where would it stow the necessary reserves for such\r\nan amount of work?\r\n\r\nThe little Spider, in her turn, is a minute particle of no size at all.\r\nWhere could she store enough fuel to keep up mobility during so long a\r\nperiod?  The imagination shrinks in dismay before the thought of an atom\r\nendowed with inexhaustible motive oils.\r\n\r\nWe must needs, therefore, appeal to the immaterial, in particular to heat-\r\nrays coming from the outside and converted into movement by the organism.\r\nThis is nutrition of energy reduced to its simplest expression: the\r\nmotive heat, instead of being extracted from the food, is utilized\r\ndirect, as supplied by the sun, which is the seat of all life.  Inert\r\nmatter has disconcerting secrets, as witness radium; living matter has\r\nsecrets of its own, which are more wonderful still.  Nothing tells us\r\nthat science will not one day turn the suspicion suggested by the Spider\r\ninto an established truth and a fundamental theory of physiology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX: THE GEOMETRY OF THE EPEIRA'S WEB\r\n\r\n\r\nI find myself confronted with a subject which is not only highly\r\ninteresting, but somewhat difficult: not that the subject is obscure; but\r\nit presupposes in the reader a certain knowledge of geometry: a strong\r\nmeat too often neglected.  I am not addressing geometricians, who are\r\ngenerally indifferent to questions of instinct, nor entomological\r\ncollectors, who, as such, take no interest in mathematical theorems; I\r\nwrite for any one with sufficient intelligence to enjoy the lessons which\r\nthe insect teaches.\r\n\r\nWhat am I to do?  To suppress this chapter were to leave out the most\r\nremarkable instance of Spider industry; to treat it as it should be\r\ntreated, that is to say, with the whole armoury of scientific formulae,\r\nwould be out of place in these modest pages.  Let us take a middle\r\ncourse, avoiding both abstruse truths and complete ignorance.\r\n\r\nLet us direct our attention to the nets of the Epeirae, preferably to\r\nthose of the Silky Epeira and the Banded Epeira, so plentiful in the\r\nautumn, in my part of the country, and so remarkable for their bulk.  We\r\nshall first observe that the radii are equally spaced; the angles formed\r\nby each consecutive pair are of perceptibly equal value; and this in\r\nspite of their number, which in the case of the Silky Epeira exceeds two\r\nscore.  We know by what strange means the Spider attains her ends and\r\ndivides the area wherein the web is to be warped into a large number of\r\nequal sectors, a number which is almost invariable in the work of each\r\nspecies.  An operation without method, governed, one might imagine, by an\r\nirresponsible whim, results in a beautiful rose-window worthy of our\r\ncompasses.\r\n\r\nWe shall also notice that, in each sector, the various chords, the\r\nelements of the spiral windings, are parallel to one another and\r\ngradually draw closer together as they near the centre.  With the two\r\nradiating lines that frame them they form obtuse angles on one side and\r\nacute angles on the other; and these angles remain constant in the same\r\nsector, because the chords are parallel.\r\n\r\nThere is more than this: these same angles, the obtuse as well as the\r\nacute, do not alter in value, from one sector to another, at any rate so\r\nfar as the conscientious eye can judge.  Taken as a whole, therefore, the\r\nrope-latticed edifice consists of a series of cross-bars intersecting the\r\nseveral radiating lines obliquely at angles of equal value.\r\n\r\nBy this characteristic we recognize the 'logarithmic spiral.'\r\nGeometricians give this name to the curve which intersects obliquely, at\r\nangles of unvarying value, all the straight lines or 'radii vectores'\r\nradiating from a centre called the 'Pole.'  The Epeira's construction,\r\ntherefore, is a series of chords joining the intersections of a\r\nlogarithmic spiral with a series of radii.  It would become merged in\r\nthis spiral if the number of radii were infinite, for this would reduce\r\nthe length of the rectilinear elements indefinitely and change this\r\npolygonal line into a curve.\r\n\r\nTo suggest an explanation why this spiral has so greatly exercised the\r\nmeditations of science, let us confine ourselves for the present to a few\r\nstatements of which the reader will find the proof in any treatise on\r\nhigher geometry.\r\n\r\nThe logarithmic spiral describes an endless number of circuits around its\r\npole, to which it constantly draws nearer without ever being able to\r\nreach it.  This central point is indefinitely inaccessible at each\r\napproaching turn.  It is obvious that this property is beyond our sensory\r\nscope.  Even with the help of the best philosophical instruments, our\r\nsight could not follow its interminable windings and would soon abandon\r\nthe attempt to divide the invisible.  It is a volute to which the brain\r\nconceives no limits.  The trained mind, alone, more discerning than our\r\nretina, sees clearly that which defies the perceptive faculties of the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira complies to the best of her ability with this law of the\r\nendless volute.  The spiral revolutions come closer together as they\r\napproach the pole.  At a given distance, they stop abruptly; but, at this\r\npoint, the auxiliary spiral, which is not destroyed in the central\r\nregion, takes up the thread; and we see it, not without some surprise,\r\ndraw nearer to the pole in ever-narrowing and scarcely perceptible\r\ncircles.  There is not, of course, absolute mathematical accuracy, but a\r\nvery close approximation to that accuracy.  The Epeira winds nearer and\r\nnearer round her pole, so far as her equipment, which, like our own, is\r\ndefective, will allow her.  One would believe her to be thoroughly versed\r\nin the laws of the spiral.\r\n\r\nI will continue to set forth, without explanations, some of the\r\nproperties of this curious curve.  Picture a flexible thread wound round\r\na logarithmic spiral.  If we then unwind it, keeping it taut the while,\r\nits free extremity will describe a spiral similar at all points to the\r\noriginal.  The curve will merely have changed places.\r\n\r\nJacques Bernouilli, {42} to whom geometry owes this magnificent theorem,\r\nhad engraved on his tomb, as one of his proudest titles to fame, the\r\ngenerating spiral and its double, begotten of the unwinding of the\r\nthread.  An inscription proclaimed, '_Eadem mutata resurgo_: I rise again\r\nlike unto myself.'  Geometry would find it difficult to better this\r\nsplendid flight of fancy towards the great problem of the hereafter.\r\n\r\nThere is another geometrical epitaph no less famous.  Cicero, when\r\nquaestor in Sicily, searching for the tomb of Archimedes amid the thorns\r\nand brambles that cover us with oblivion, recognized it, among the ruins,\r\nby the geometrical figure engraved upon the stone: the cylinder\r\ncircumscribing the sphere.  Archimedes, in fact, was the first to know\r\nthe approximate relation of circumference to diameter; from it he deduced\r\nthe perimeter and surface of the circle, as well as the surface and\r\nvolume of the sphere.  He showed that the surface and volume of the last-\r\nnamed equal two-thirds of the surface and volume of the circumscribing\r\ncylinder.  Disdaining all pompous inscription, the learned Syracusan\r\nhonoured himself with his theorem as his sole epitaph.  The geometrical\r\nfigure proclaimed the individual's name as plainly as would any\r\nalphabetical characters.\r\n\r\nTo have done with this part of our subject, here is another property of\r\nthe logarithmic spiral.  Roll the curve along an indefinite straight\r\nline.  Its pole will become displaced while still keeping on one straight\r\nline.  The endless scroll leads to rectilinear progression; the\r\nperpetually varied begets uniformity.\r\n\r\nNow is this logarithmic spiral, with its curious properties, merely a\r\nconception of the geometers, combining number and extent, at will, so as\r\nto imagine a tenebrous abyss wherein to practise their analytical methods\r\nafterwards?  Is it a mere dream in the night of the intricate, an\r\nabstract riddle flung out for our understanding to browse upon?\r\n\r\nNo, it is a reality in the service of life, a method of construction\r\nfrequently employed in animal architecture.  The Mollusc, in particular,\r\nnever rolls the winding ramp of the shell without reference to the\r\nscientific curve.  The first-born of the species knew it and put it into\r\npractice; it was as perfect in the dawn of creation as it can be to-day.\r\n\r\nLet us study, in this connection, the Ammonites, those venerable relics\r\nof what was once the highest expression of living things, at the time\r\nwhen the solid land was taking shape from the oceanic ooze.  Cut and\r\npolished length-wise, the fossil shows a magnificent logarithmic spiral,\r\nthe general pattern of the dwelling which was a pearl palace, with\r\nnumerous chambers traversed by a siphuncular corridor.\r\n\r\nTo this day, the last representative of the Cephalopoda with partitioned\r\nshells, the Nautilus of the Southern Seas, remains faithful to the\r\nancient design; it has not improved upon its distant predecessors.  It\r\nhas altered the position of the siphuncle, has placed it in the centre\r\ninstead of leaving it on the back, but it still whirls its spiral\r\nlogarithmically as did the Ammonites in the earliest ages of the world's\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAnd let us not run away with the idea that these princes of the Mollusc\r\ntribe have a monopoly of the scientific curve.  In the stagnant waters of\r\nour grassy ditches, the flat shells, the humble Planorbes, sometimes no\r\nbigger than a duckweed, vie with the Ammonite and the Nautilus in matters\r\nof higher geometry.  At least one of them, _Planorbis vortex_, for\r\nexample, is a marvel of logarithmic whorls.\r\n\r\nIn the long-shaped shells, the structure becomes more complex, though\r\nremaining subject to the same fundamental laws.  I have before my eyes\r\nsome species of the genus Terebra, from New Caledonia.  They are\r\nextremely tapering cones, attaining almost nine inches in length.  Their\r\nsurface is smooth and quite plain, without any of the usual ornaments,\r\nsuch as furrows, knots or strings of pearls.  The spiral edifice is\r\nsuperb, graced with its own simplicity alone.  I count a score of whorls\r\nwhich gradually decrease until they vanish in the delicate point.  They\r\nare edged with a fine groove.\r\n\r\nI take a pencil and draw a rough generating line to this cone; and,\r\nrelying merely on the evidence of my eyes, which are more or less\r\npractised in geometric measurements, I find that the spiral groove\r\nintersects this generating line at an angle of unvarying value.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this result is easily deduced.  If projected on a\r\nplane perpendicular to the axis of the shell, the generating lines of the\r\ncone would become radii; and the groove which winds upwards from the base\r\nto the apex would be converted into a plane curve which, meeting those\r\nradii at an unvarying angle, would be neither more nor less than a\r\nlogarithmic spiral.  Conversely, the groove of the shell may be\r\nconsidered as the projection of this spiral on a conic surface.\r\n\r\nBetter still.  Let us imagine a plane perpendicular to the aids of the\r\nshell and passing through its summit.  Let us imagine, moreover, a thread\r\nwound along the spiral groove.  Let us unroll the thread, holding it taut\r\nas we do so.  Its extremity will not leave the plane and will describe a\r\nlogarithmic spiral within it.  It is, in a more complicated degree, a\r\nvariant of Bernouilli's '_Eadem mutata resurgo_:' the logarithmic conic\r\ncurve becomes a logarithmic plane curve.\r\n\r\nA similar geometry is found in the other shells with elongated cones,\r\nTurritellae, Spindle-shells, Cerithia, as well as in the shells with\r\nflattened cones, Trochidae, Turbines.  The spherical shells, those\r\nwhirled into a volute, are no exception to this rule.  All, down to the\r\ncommon Snail-shell, are constructed according to logarithmic laws.  The\r\nfamous spiral of the geometers is the general plan followed by the\r\nMollusc rolling its stone sheath.\r\n\r\nWhere do these glairy creatures pick up this science?  We are told that\r\nthe Mollusc derives from the Worm.  One day, the Worm, rendered frisky by\r\nthe sun, emancipated itself, brandished its tail and twisted it into a\r\ncorkscrew for sheer glee.  There and then the plan of the future spiral\r\nshell was discovered.\r\n\r\nThis is what is taught quite seriously, in these days, as the very last\r\nword in scientific progress.  It remains to be seen up to what point the\r\nexplanation is acceptable.  The Spider, for her part, will have none of\r\nit.  Unrelated to the appendix-lacking, corkscrew-twirling Worm, she is\r\nnevertheless familiar with the logarithmic spiral.  From the celebrated\r\ncurve she obtains merely a sort of framework; but, elementary though this\r\nframework be, it clearly marks the ideal edifice.  The Epeira works on\r\nthe same principles as the Mollusc of the convoluted shell.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusc has years wherein to construct its spiral and it uses the\r\nutmost finish in the whirling process.  The Epeira, to spread her net,\r\nhas but an hour's sitting at the most, wherefore the speed at which she\r\nworks compels her to rest content with a simpler production.  She\r\nshortens the task by confining herself to a skeleton of the curve which\r\nthe other describes to perfection.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira, therefore, is versed in the geometric secrets of the Ammonite\r\nand the _Nautilus pompilus_; she uses, in a simpler form, the logarithmic\r\nline dear to the Snail.  What guides her?  There is no appeal here to a\r\nwriggle of some kind, as in the case of the Worm that ambitiously aspires\r\nto become a Mollusc.  The animal must needs carry within itself a virtual\r\ndiagram of its spiral.  Accident, however fruitful in surprises we may\r\npresume it to be, can never have taught it the higher geometry wherein\r\nour own intelligence at once goes astray, without a strict preliminary\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nAre we to recognize a mere effect of organic structure in the Epeira's\r\nart?  We readily think of the legs, which, endowed with a very varying\r\npower of extension, might serve as compasses.  More or less bent, more or\r\nless outstretched, they would mechanically determine the angle whereat\r\nthe spiral shall intersect the radius; they would maintain the parallel\r\nof the chords in each sector.\r\n\r\nCertain objections arise to affirm that, in this instance, the tool is\r\nnot the sole regulator of the work.  Were the arrangement of the thread\r\ndetermined by the length of the legs, we should find the spiral volutes\r\nseparated more widely from one another in proportion to the greater\r\nlength of implement in the spinstress.  We see this in the Banded Epeira\r\nand the Silky Epeira.  The first has longer limbs and spaces her cross-\r\nthreads more liberally than does the second, whose legs are shorter.\r\n\r\nBut we must not rely too much on this rule, say others.  The Angular\r\nEpeira, the Paletinted Epeira and the Cross Spider, all three more or\r\nless short-limbed, rival the Banded Epeira in the spacing of their lime-\r\nsnares.  The last two even dispose them with greater intervening\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nWe recognize in another respect that the organization of the animal does\r\nnot imply an immutable type of work.  Before beginning the sticky spiral,\r\nthe Epeirae first spin an auxiliary intended to strengthen the stays.\r\nThis spiral, formed of plain, non-glutinous thread, starts from the\r\ncentre and winds in rapidly-widening circles to the circumference.  It is\r\nmerely a temporary construction, whereof naught but the central part\r\nsurvives when the Spider has set its limy meshes.  The second spiral, the\r\nessential part of the snare, proceeds, on the contrary, in serried coils\r\nfrom the circumference to the centre and is composed entirely of viscous\r\ncross-threads.\r\n\r\nHere we have, following one after the other merely by a sudden alteration\r\nof the machine, two volutes of an entirely different order as regards\r\ndirection, the number of whorls and intersection.  Both of them are\r\nlogarithmic spirals.  I see no mechanism of the legs, be they long or\r\nshort, that can account for this alteration.\r\n\r\nCan it then be a premeditated design on the part of the Epeira?  Can\r\nthere be calculation, measurement of angles, gauging of the parallel by\r\nmeans of the eye or otherwise?  I am inclined to think that there is none\r\nof all this, or at least nothing but an innate propensity, whose effects\r\nthe animal is no more able to control than the flower is able to control\r\nthe arrangement of its verticils.  The Epeira practises higher geometry\r\nwithout knowing or caring.  The thing works of itself and takes its\r\nimpetus from an instinct imposed upon creation from the start.\r\n\r\nThe stone thrown by the hand returns to earth describing a certain curve;\r\nthe dead leaf torn and wafted away by a breath of wind makes its journey\r\nfrom the tree to the ground with a similar curve.  On neither the one\r\nside nor the other is there any action by the moving body to regulate the\r\nfall; nevertheless, the descent takes place according to a scientific\r\ntrajectory, the 'parabola,' of which the section of a cone by a plane\r\nfurnished the prototype to the geometer's speculations.  A figure, which\r\nwas at first but a tentative glimpse, becomes a reality by the fall of a\r\npebble out of the vertical.\r\n\r\nThe same speculations take up the parabola once more, imagine it rolling\r\non an indefinite straight line and ask what course does the focus of this\r\ncurve follow.  The answer comes: The focus of the parabola describes a\r\n'catenary,' a line very simple in shape, but endowed with an algebraic\r\nsymbol that has to resort to a kind of cabalistic number at variance with\r\nany sort of numeration, so much so that the unit refuses to express it,\r\nhowever much we subdivide the unit.  It is called the number _e_.  Its\r\nvalue is represented by the following series carried out ad infinitum:\r\n\r\n   e = 1 + 1/1 + 1/(1*2) + 1/(1*2*3) + 1/(1*2*3*4) + 1/(1*2*3*4*5) + etc\r\n\r\nIf the reader had the patience to work out the few initial terms of this\r\nseries, which has no limit, because the series of natural numerals itself\r\nhas none, he would find:\r\n\r\n   e=2.7182818...\r\n\r\nWith this weird number are we now stationed within the strictly defined\r\nrealm of the imagination?  Not at all: the catenary appears actually\r\nevery time that weight and flexibility act in concert.  The name is given\r\nto the curve formed by a chain suspended by two of its points which are\r\nnot placed on a vertical line.  It is the shape taken by a flexible cord\r\nwhen held at each end and relaxed; it is the line that governs the shape\r\nof a sail bellying in the wind; it is the curve of the nanny-goat's milk-\r\nbag when she returns from filling her trailing udder.  And all this\r\nanswers to the number e.\r\n\r\nWhat a quantity of abstruse science for a bit of string!  Let us not be\r\nsurprised.  A pellet of shot swinging at the end of a thread, a drop of\r\ndew trickling down a straw, a splash of water rippling under the kisses\r\nof the air, a mere trifle, after all, requires a titanic scaffolding when\r\nwe wish to examine it with the eye of calculation.  We need the club of\r\nHercules to crush a fly.\r\n\r\nOur methods of mathematical investigation are certainly ingenious; we\r\ncannot too much admire the mighty brains that have invented them; but how\r\nslow and laborious they appear when compared with the smallest\r\nactualities!  Will it never be given to us to probe reality in a simpler\r\nfashion?  Will our intelligence be able one day to dispense with the\r\nheavy arsenal of formulae?  Why not?\r\n\r\nHere we have the abracadabric number _e_ reappearing, inscribed on a\r\nSpider's thread.  Let us examine, on a misty morning, the meshwork that\r\nhas been constructed during the night.  Owing to their hygrometrical\r\nnature, the sticky threads are laden with tiny drops, and, bending under\r\nthe burden, have become so many catenaries, so many chaplets of limpid\r\ngems, graceful chaplets arranged in exquisite order and following the\r\ncurve of a swing.  If the sun pierce the mist, the whole lights up with\r\niridescent fires and becomes a resplendent cluster of diamonds.  The\r\nnumber _e_ is in its glory.\r\n\r\nGeometry, that is to say, the science of harmony in space, presides over\r\neverything.  We find it in the arrangement of the scales of a fir-cone,\r\nas in the arrangement of an Epeira's limy web; we find it in the spiral\r\nof a Snail-shell, in the chaplet of a Spider's thread, as in the orbit of\r\na planet; it is everywhere, as perfect in the world of atoms as in the\r\nworld of immensities.\r\n\r\nAnd this universal geometry tells us of an Universal Geometrician, whose\r\ndivine compass has measured all things.  I prefer that, as an explanation\r\nof the logarithmic curve of the Ammonite and the Epeira, to the Worm\r\nscrewing up the tip of its tail.  It may not perhaps be in accordance\r\nwith latter-day teaching, but it takes a loftier flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}  A small or moderate-sized spider found among foliage.--Translator's\r\nNote.\r\n\r\n{2}  Leon Dufour (1780-1865) was an army surgeon who served with\r\ndistinction in several campaigns and subsequently practised as a doctor\r\nin the Landes.
