  "content": "The Last Quarry\r\n\r\nby Bryce Walton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _We’ve always believed that when the last man stands alone and\r\n  defiant beneath the dwindling radiance of a dying sun he will\r\n  still find a way to ward off disaster--precisely as Bryce Walton\r\n  has boldly enabled his predecessors to do with such triumphant\r\n  logic. Do you remember Mr. Walton’s earlier, astounding story of a\r\n  twenty-first century Jack the Giant Killer? Well, there are slayers\r\n  far more insidiously terrifying to combat here, each as deadly as a\r\n  basilisk._\r\n\r\n  =The Servitor’s zombielike eyes mirrored man’s deepest yearnings.\r\n  By what miracle had human science sired creatures so monstrous?=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sky was the color of mercury, and thick snow fell out of it,\r\nheavily as though it would never stop.\r\n\r\nHall had been sitting at the window for almost two hours looking at the\r\nsnow, as if fascinated by the way it seemed to dissolve everything into\r\na peaceful and white anonymity. He sat heavily, hunched over in the\r\ngray light watching the snow, and watching the figures walking along\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of them were walking by twos--hurrying somewhere together.\r\nAnd the ones who were alone were hurrying in a way that said they\r\nwouldn’t be alone long.\r\n\r\nHall, a big man, sat heavily as though he would be alone forever. So\r\nabsorbed was he in the white world beyond the windowpane that the phone\r\nrang five times before he realized it.\r\n\r\nHe scooped up the receiver, a look of embittered weariness seeming to\r\nadd years to his age.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed he was getting tired of the hunt.\r\n\r\n“Hall, I’ve got to see you at once!” said a woman’s voice at the other\r\nend of the wire.\r\n\r\n“All right, Donna,” Hall replied. “Are you at home?”\r\n\r\nThe woman’s voice was ragged, and anyway Hall had known he was nearing\r\nthe end of the hunt. His hands tingled, and some of the old excitement\r\ncame back....\r\n\r\n“Did you get to see Martin?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes. Just a glimpse of him. But God--that was enough.”\r\n\r\n“And--the servant?” Hall asked quietly.\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t let me stay. He’s sharper than any of the others. He knew\r\nI wasn’t a public stenographer as soon as he saw me. But I managed to\r\ncatch a glimpse of Martin through the library door. An accident ... the\r\ndoor came open a little. Then our little public enemy number nine\r\nhundred and ninety-nine told me to get out!”\r\n\r\n“So it could follow you, of course,” said Hall. “I guess Martin looks\r\npretty bad by now.”\r\n\r\n“Horrible. So fat--like a huge white toad in a wheelchair. It was\r\nunbelievable. He was staring at me, but he didn’t seem to see me at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be right over, Donna,” Hall said. “Be sure it’s me outside your\r\ndoor. Check the identification. We’re the only two who should know\r\nabout your apartment. If anyone else tries to get in, kill them.”\r\n\r\nHall replaced the receiver. He turned slowly toward the door. They\r\nhadn’t wasted any time. One of them was in the hallway.\r\n\r\nNo. 999 had gone much farther than most of the others. Using human\r\nbeings to do its legwork. But human beings were comparatively easy to\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nHall stood in the middle of the dim room and gave it a last survey,\r\nknowing he would never see it again.\r\n\r\n_My room_, he thought. _My headquarters for five years_.\r\n\r\nIt was a dingy mouldy three-floor walkup in a section of the city that\r\nhad been condemned and would soon be destroyed and replaced by glass\r\nand chrome and neat little flower gardens.\r\n\r\nJust a gray room with a worn carpet, a single narrow bed, a flowered\r\nvase lampbase with a dusty shade. A room with nothing distinctive\r\nabout it to identify it as belonging to Hall, either under that name\r\nor any of the other names he used at various times. No books, no\r\nmagazines--nothing really individualistic.\r\n\r\nExcept for the topcoat over the chair there weren’t even any clothes\r\nin the closet. Hall had only one suit and he was wearing it, as he had\r\nworn it continuously for five years. He stood there as though he were\r\nabout to rent the room, or had only just moved in.\r\n\r\nHall moved silently to the door. The vague sound came again and he\r\nevaluated the sound with the trained attunement of his unique training.\r\nTo others it would have been a sound thoroughly non-suspect in its\r\nresemblance to a whisper of wind, or the rustling of torn wallpaper, or\r\neven a rat.\r\n\r\nHall could picture the fool standing out there. Some cheap thug,\r\nno doubt, who had no idea who had hired him, or what he was really\r\ninvolved in. Some habitual criminal type whom no amount of arrests and\r\ntreatment had been able to change. And now he wanted to die.\r\n\r\nHall could even tell exactly where the fool was standing, hunched over\r\nslightly, listening with his every nerve alert.\r\n\r\nHall stepped forward and jerked the door open. The man was still trying\r\nto drag a small revolver up. With an oath Hall grabbed his wrist and\r\nswung him around and pressed his fingers into a yielding throat.\r\n\r\nThe miserable wretch made no sound. He struggled in nervous spasmodic\r\nmovements like a fish. When he stopped struggling any way at all, Hall\r\nput him on the bed and then went out into the hallway.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t know if the man were dead or not. By the time Hall reached\r\nthe window and the fire escape he had forgotten all about him. Hall’s\r\nefficiency depended, among many things, on dismissing unimportant\r\nincidents from his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had hunted down and destroyed but two less than a thousand of them,\r\nand there was only one left who could be thought of as dangerous. So\r\nfar it was a perfect record, and Hall intended to finish the job before\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer tired. He didn’t feel that frightening loneliness any\r\nmore either. He felt nothing now except the finely-tuned machinery of\r\nthe hunter working, a kind of high but careful excitement.\r\n\r\nTwo figures stood across the street under the white-crusted trees.\r\nHe was sure that two more were stationed just at the foot of the\r\nthird-floor stairwell waiting for a signal from the man who wasn’t\r\ngoing to give them any signal.\r\n\r\nIt would be easier to go down the fire escape--and faster. He knew\r\nthat he had to move fast, very fast. There was a chance that he hadn’t\r\nlearned the identity of No. 999 soon enough to stop him from using\r\nvital information he had certainly been squeezing out of Martin. The\r\nother Servitors had fixed themselves to some high and important people.\r\nBut No. 999 had really hit high.\r\n\r\nBen Martin had been the Administrator of the Secret Government Research\r\nCenter in Virginia for ten years. A month ago he had retired in the\r\nface of loud protest--giving illness as an excuse--and a week after\r\nthat his wife had died of a heart attack.\r\n\r\nBut even that wouldn’t have aroused any suspicions. It was a word about\r\na servant Martin had recently hired--and a word from his wife before\r\nshe died--which had given Hall the clue he needed, and started him on\r\nhis last hunt.\r\n\r\nMartin’s wife had hired what she thought was a servant. She could\r\nscarcely have been blamed for not knowing that the servant she had\r\nengaged in good faith was not a human being, but a Servitor. Neither\r\ncould she have known that a Servitor was an artificial creation no\r\none could distinguish from a human being except by its destructive\r\ninfluence. And the victim was not in a position to make any such\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\nNo. 999 had wormed plenty of dangerous information out of Martin. What\r\nit intended doing with the information wasn’t Hall’s concern. No. 999\r\nwould use it to gain power, of course. He might try to get out of the\r\ncountry with the information and use it against the United States with\r\nthe backing of some antagonistic nation. No. 999 might even be planning\r\nto blast loose at the living breathing humanity which had created it\r\nand which it hated with such unhuman virulence.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain: No. 999 was far more intelligent than any of\r\nthe others had been. It had avoided detection for five years where the\r\nothers had failed. It had benefited from its predecessor’s mistakes. It\r\nknew a lot more than it had known five years ago, and it had been built\r\nto be highly intelligent to start with.\r\n\r\nHall’s only concern was to kill it.\r\n\r\nHe went to the window, jerked it up and went through, under the guard\r\nrail and down the stairwell in the fire escape platform. The rust and\r\ncold iron tore at him, but he didn’t feel it. His hands broke the fall,\r\nand then he dropped on down, with bullets chipping around him at the\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nHe ran for three blocks in the gray evening that was fast turning\r\ncharcoal, and the lights blinking on in the few poor scattered shops\r\nhardly seemed like light at all.\r\n\r\nHe ran into the alley. Wind bit at his cheeks and kicked at his hair,\r\nand pushed the smell of the sky like a fading hope into his breathing.\r\n\r\nIcicles hung from the lip of the garbage can and a half-dead cat\r\nhuddled against the brick wall. The animal didn’t even snarl as Hall\r\nmoved beside it against the wall. The thickening shadows were blue now\r\nlike the shadows of all his hunting years. Except that this particular\r\nyear seemed older as Hall waited, as though it had suddenly grown\r\nincredibly ancient in a month.\r\n\r\nHe knew he would never hunt again, so he thought of Donna as he waited.\r\nShe at least would go on living and hunting. Like so many others, she\r\nhad started to love him, never once suspecting that he couldn’t love\r\nher in return. Her cross was her excessive need for an unreal love.\r\nThat kind of abnormally centered hunger was dangerous. It was the big\r\nhuman weakness....\r\n\r\nHe heard the pursuer who had stayed close behind him and ahead of the\r\nothers, coming on stolidly. It was not even moving with the aliveness\r\nof uncertainty down the white funnel of the night. It was no more\r\nthan a dumb clod carrying out orders against humanity--the orders of\r\nsomething that had never been human.\r\n\r\nThere he was, in the alley’s mouth. He flinched suddenly, and crouched\r\nlike some kind of animal, realizing that he was standing vulnerable,\r\nwide open to attack.\r\n\r\nHe started to cry out as Hall swung the heavy soggy weight of the\r\ngarbage can into his stomach. It struck him and he fell with a groan to\r\nhis knees, fumbling stupidly in his topcoat pocket for a gun.\r\n\r\nHall used his fist, very sharply, and only twice. He employed the\r\nsimplest means and worked silently so as to avoid the red tape of\r\napprehension, and all the pretensions of being something else that\r\nslowed up his work.\r\n\r\nSnow fell on the man’s upturned face, melting on his wide, big-pupiled\r\neyes. Swiftly Hall ran to the other end of the alley and then over to\r\nSeventh Avenue and ducked into a drugstore to call Schor, the Security\r\nChief.\r\n\r\nA few of the others had hired humans to stooge for them, but only a\r\nfew. No. 999 was less prejudiced than the others of his kind. The\r\nstooges never knew of course.\r\n\r\nNo one knew that a thousand Servitors, experimental models, had been\r\nbuilt by the Dalsan Company six years before. No one knew that they had\r\ndisappeared of their own volition, and that due to some unforeseeable\r\nmiscalculation, they had been not only as intelligent as most humans,\r\nbut had possessed a degree of free will, and a consuming hatred for\r\nhumans.\r\n\r\nThe Security Department had decided it would be better if people didn’t\r\nknow. And that it would also be a good idea if people never found out.\r\n\r\nIn fact, only three individuals knew now. Allen Schor the Security\r\nChief, Donna Connell a top operative--and Hall. The scientists who had\r\ndesigned and built the Servitors for the Dalsan Company had known, of\r\ncourse. But they had committed suicide.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Schor,” Hall said on the telephone. “I’m on my way to Martin’s.\r\nI know it’s got him. I’m dropping by to see if Donna’s all right. Then\r\nI’m heading straight for Martin’s.” There was a long pause. Then Schor\r\nsaid: “Let us stand by this time.”\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t do any good,” Hall told him.\r\n\r\n“It might,” Schor persisted. “This one’s the worst. I don’t want\r\nanything--”\r\n\r\n“--to happen to me?” Hall smiled. “I’m afraid you’re getting\r\nsentimental in your old age.”\r\n\r\n“Just give me the word to stand by,” Schor pleaded.\r\n\r\n“You’d only get yourself killed. You wouldn’t stand a chance. You’ve\r\nalways wanted to stand by, but you know damn well if I can’t swing it,\r\nthen you couldn’t do a thing--except die.”\r\n\r\n“Well--be careful,” Schor warned. “For God’s sake, Hall, be careful.\r\nThis is the last one. If something happened to you now, after we’ve\r\ngotten clear through to the last one--”\r\n\r\n“It’s too late to worry,” Hall said. “Oh ... and tell your wife I really\r\nenjoyed our long talk the other night about Plato. Tell her I still\r\ndon’t agree with her that he was anything but a detriment to history,\r\nbut that it was a very pleasant evening.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes--all right. I’ll tell her.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHall stared at the door. Donna wasn’t there to greet him.\r\n\r\nHe knew that she had been in the apartment only a few minutes before.\r\nBut she wasn’t anywhere in the three-room hideaway now. He knew as well\r\nthat no one had arrived before him to spirit her away.\r\n\r\nShe had gone because a part of her over which she had no control had\r\nforced her to go. Back to Martin’s--and the Servitor. She had looked\r\ntoo long and too deeply at No. 999, and now she was gone.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Servitors resided solely in the weakness of the human\r\nbeings who looked at them, and were looked at in return. And no one was\r\nimmune, Hall remembered with horror as he ran back down the stairs to\r\nget a cab to take him to the airport. No one--not even Donna.\r\n\r\nShe had resisted all the others, with Hall’s constant support. But No.\r\n999 had looked too deeply. And Donna was just a little too hungry for\r\nlove. True, there was no better operative than Donna. But she was human\r\nand--she believed in magic. Unfortunately a belief in magic was common\r\namong primitive tribes, and universal among children, and it lingered\r\non in every civilized human being. Every modern man and woman had some\r\none deep desire, stronger than all the others, and that desire was\r\nfortified by the feeling that if this one big urge could be satisfied,\r\nthey would then be free of anxiety--made whole, and utterly happy. It\r\nwas a reaching out for some kind of Nirvana.\r\n\r\nDonna covered up her deep unconscious loneliness well enough. She was\r\npretty enough. But unconsciously she believed in the magic of a great\r\nlove that would cure everything. And the trouble with the Servitors was\r\nthat when they looked at you, you became convinced that they could give\r\nyou the one thing you wanted most on earth.\r\n\r\nThey could too. But what a human wanted most, he could die from having.\r\nHe could die because what a human wanted most was a pathological need.\r\nNo matter what it was--if he could get all he wanted of it--it killed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHall thought of Martin turning from a gaunt man into what Donna had\r\ndescribed as a huge white toad. As soon as he had suspected that No.\r\n999 was Martin’s servant, he had investigated Martin’s background. No.\r\n999 had simply been giving Martin what his neurotic self had always\r\nwanted most.\r\n\r\nAnd that was precisely what Donna had gone back to get from No. 999.\r\n\r\nAs the helioplane lifted and moved off through the snow sea of the sky,\r\nHall remembered the room he had left, the hidden apartment of Donna’s\r\nwhich neither he nor she would ever see again.\r\n\r\nOnce ... once she had been waiting there for him. They had worked\r\ntogether for years but Hall had never suspected how Donna was beginning\r\nto feel about him. It was a better kind of irony that he could think\r\nabout it now.\r\n\r\nThe invitation to dinner--the candle light--the red Chianti wine....\r\nThat never-to-be-forgotten night with Donna was something that could\r\nonly happen once with Hall, but then--it hadn’t happened. It might have\r\nbut it hadn’t. Which was all that Hall could have expected, of course.\r\nIt was strange that he couldn’t quite rub out the way he had expected\r\nmore....\r\n\r\nHe could remember the smell of her perfume, the intimate tones of her\r\nvoice calling softly to him in his loneliness. He could remember how\r\nher dark eyes seemed to come closer and ever closer, and her warm hands\r\non his face....\r\n\r\nHe could feel her touch again now--the subdued flickering inside him\r\nlike an uneasy flame. The fire that could smoulder but never leap high.\r\n\r\nThere was a pain in his throat, and like a flashlight into his dark\r\nmisery he saw her figure as he had seen it so many times before.\r\n\r\nThat was his weakness.\r\n\r\nBut he had conquered it.\r\n\r\nHe took another cab from the village toward Martin’s country estate.\r\nAlong a narrow road already carpeted with snow it sped, and the entire\r\nworld seemed covered, and silent in the night. The only sound was the\r\nhissing of flakes that seemed to be falling clear across the land. They\r\ndescended slow and sullen in a kind of quiet that seemed as endless as\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n“No, don’t wait,” Hall said to the driver as the red tail light blinked\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHe left the cab at a turn in the road about half a mile from Martin’s\r\nhouse, and started walking through the snow toward its squares of\r\nyellow light. He knew Martin very well from an intricate study of his\r\nlife. The man had been one of the top research physicists, and yet he\r\nhad never really grown up. His wife had taken care of him for years,\r\nbabied him. It was inevitable that Martin should never have really\r\nlearned to take care of himself. Unconsciously, therefore, he had\r\nalways wanted above everything else for someone to take care of him.\r\n\r\nThat was Martin’s weakness.\r\n\r\nMartin’s wife had evidently needed help because of Martin’s demands,\r\nso she had hired a personal servant--No. 999. The Servitor had killed\r\nher. Then, without regret or remorse, it had taken over completely the\r\njob of fulfilling Martin’s needs. And it had managed the task far more\r\neffectively than Mrs. Martin could have done.\r\n\r\nMartin probably didn’t even bother feeding himself any more--just\r\nsat day after day in his wheelchair growing fatter and fatter.\r\nBeing completely taken care of the way he had always wanted and\r\nstripped of all of his worries. No more headaches, no more terrible\r\nresponsibilities. No more decisions involving cobalt bombs or sprays of\r\ngerms, or something even more hideous to contemplate.\r\n\r\nNo. 999 would take care of everything.\r\n\r\nAnd Donna?\r\n\r\nNo. 999 had promised Donna love. She hadn’t been conscious of it, but\r\nthe promise itself was what she had _really_ been afraid of when\r\nshe had called Hall earlier, with such terror in her voice.\r\n\r\nOf being taken over, of being given what she wanted until she wouldn’t\r\nwant anything else again, wouldn’t even want to live again....\r\n\r\nHall dropped flat on his stomach and crawled toward the porch, his\r\nsenses scanning the area. He waited for long minutes, but could detect\r\nnothing. He was almost certain that No. 999 wouldn’t be ready. How\r\ncould the Servitor have any way of knowing that a lucky chain of\r\ncircumstances had enabled him to act almost immediately.\r\n\r\nHall lay tight against the base of the porch, with its rocks and\r\nice-crusted mortar. Every danger-charged minute seemed only a kind of\r\nre-living, for the hunt was no longer anything new. Slowly he raised\r\nhimself on his elbows and looked through the French windows.\r\n\r\nDonna was lying on a couch before the burning fireplace. She might have\r\nbeen dead. Her arms were hanging down on both sides of the couch, and\r\nshe was staring at the ceiling. In her eyes there was an expectant joy\r\ntoo great to describe or understand. Like a wraith stretched out in a\r\ncoffin she seemed, waiting for the joys of Heaven.\r\n\r\nHe remembered again the night when she had offered him everything--far\r\nmore than she was offering him now. Then at least there had been\r\nsomething full and genuine in her feelings about him. He felt sad,\r\ntragically sad, and somehow responsible for her defeat.\r\n\r\nHe desensitized himself so he would feel no disconcerting pain, and\r\nthen he resolutely heaved himself over the porch railing, and without\r\npausing to draw breath hurled himself through the glass of the French\r\nwindows. But the element of shocking surprise wasn’t enough. For an\r\ninstant Hall saw the lean deadly form through a glittering spray of\r\nsplintering wood and slivers of glass, and rolled desperately to seek\r\ncover behind a chair.\r\n\r\nThe three explosions rang deafeningly in his ears, and the impact of\r\nthe slugs seemed to drive him into the gray rug of the floor. If No.\r\n999 had been clasping a circuit gun Hall would no longer be alive.\r\n\r\nDesensitized, he felt nothing except the bitter black gall of possible\r\nfailure. His shattered leg wouldn’t function. He hitched himself\r\naround, and as he did so a wheelchair came out of a door to the right\r\nof the blazing fireplace. Martin was covered with an Indian blanket. He\r\nwas a huge mound of unrecognizable suet.\r\n\r\nNo one could have remembered at that moment that the figure had ever\r\nbeen Martin. Hall heard a frightful voice, a grotesque wheezing sigh of\r\nbabyish irritation. But nothing moved behind the sound except the pink\r\nrosebud lips, and even they moved with a heavy torpor.\r\n\r\n“Richard ... who is it? What is happening here?”\r\n\r\nThe puffed marshmallow face, the eyes like those of a grazing animal\r\nfaded as Hall twisted on around, moving the circuit gun. The voice, the\r\nimage of Martin, had all filled up no more than a second’s space of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSo _it_ was called Richard now! It was moving along the wall as\r\nthough in some strange fashion it had moved out of the wall itself.\r\nImmaculate, lean and trim in a black suit, with its white face\r\ndestitute of any emotion that Hall could see. Yet how odd that that\r\nface had been so effective in reflecting the deepest, most despairing\r\nneeds of human beings. It was an evil kind of mirror.\r\n\r\nIt fired again. Hall slid forward, feeling his body throb. He saw the\r\nhole appear in his coat sleeve. His fingers spread out uselessly and\r\nthe circuit gun slipped away from him....\r\n\r\nHall felt the leg of the heavy table against his other hand. Richard\r\nsmiled down and aimed the revolver relentlessly at Hall’s head. Only it\r\nwasn’t really a smile at all.\r\n\r\n“So you’re not a man,” _it_ said.\r\n\r\n“No,” Hall replied, in a defiant whisper.\r\n\r\n“You’ve done a good job of concealing the fact.”\r\n\r\nHall didn’t move. “I threw up a different oscillation, so you would\r\nthink I was human,” he said. “It made you just careless enough to make\r\nthe difference. You and the others.”\r\n\r\n“What difference? You die. You’re not like the rest of us, though.”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly,” Hall said. “I was number one thousand, only my\r\nmotivations were different. I was made for only one purpose--to kill\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Then they didn’t do such a good job with you. You must realize that\r\nI’m going to kill you.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t kill me,” Hall affirmed quietly.\r\n\r\nHe moved like an explosion. The table crushed the middle of No. 999\r\ninto the wall. Hall fired a full charge from the circuit gun into its\r\nneck and--into the vital thermostat.\r\n\r\nThe face of No. 999 became a melting lopsided mask. One of its eyes\r\nfell out, and twisted on a wiry strand in the lamplight like a pendant.\r\n\r\nNo. 999--Richard--was dead.\r\n\r\nThe end of the road.\r\n\r\nNo human could have done it. A human had needs that were stronger\r\nthan his ability to resist a Servitor, even for a minute. And the\r\nlimitation had included Schor, Donna, every human victim. A human was\r\ntoo vulnerable. But now No. 999 lay on the floor, a pile of synthetic\r\nclay. It too had become vulnerable. Hall heard a scream....\r\n\r\nMartin’s body fell from the wheelchair and lay, a shapeless mound of\r\nreal clay on the floor, as though released from some overmastering\r\ncompulsion. Was he dead--or just paralyzed?\r\n\r\nIt was no concern of Hall’s. His concern had never been with men.\r\n\r\nHe managed to get up and half fell toward the door. A feeling of\r\nuselessness was taking hold of him. His efficiency was now gravely\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t even aware that someone was standing just outside the door.\r\nHall glanced at Donna, still waiting for the love he could never give\r\nher. Still waiting for some perfect host to supply the substance of all\r\nher childhood dreams of a glorious, all-consuming love....\r\n\r\nIt would be better with a human being, real....\r\n\r\nOnce she had almost made Hall feel human. But that had been a long time\r\nago.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door.\r\n\r\nSchor was standing there, his hands in his topcoat pockets, a little\r\nhunched man with an owl’s face and snow on his eyebrows. Behind him was\r\nan official Security car, and two Security officers stood at the foot\r\nof the porch steps with their guns ready.\r\n\r\nSchor held Hall in his arms, and patted his back with a slow, deep\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n“I came out anyway, Hall,” he said, his voice husky. “Thought you might\r\nneed me for this last show. I wanted to come.”\r\n\r\n_I won’t be working with him again_, Hall thought. Friendship\r\nended when his task was done. “If you’d arrived a minute earlier it\r\nwould have killed you,” Hall said. “It had more power than any fifty of\r\nthe others.”\r\n\r\nSchor essayed an anxious laugh. “Sure, I know. I’m only human.”\r\n\r\n“Well--all your worries are over,” Hall said.\r\n\r\n“Are the remains taken care of, Hall?”\r\n\r\nHall nodded. “Like the others. A few more minutes and there won’t be\r\nany trace of him except a charcoal gray suit.”\r\n\r\n“Convenient,” Schor said. “I’m referring, of course, to that built in,\r\nself-incinerating device.”\r\n\r\n“Very,” Hall acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe Security officers were coming in. Someone was using a\r\nphone ... announcing that Martin was dead. Hall heard Donna moan vaguely\r\nand he was glad she was alive.\r\n\r\nNo. 999 was a melting pile against the wall, fading away.

He stood there\r\nas the snow fell more thickly, covering him over gradually until he\r\nblended into the pale silence.
