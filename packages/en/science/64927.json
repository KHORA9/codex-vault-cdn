Morrison, General Staff, who desired to make use of it in the\r\ncourse in tactics in the Army Service Schools.\r\n\r\nIt is an epitome of the interpretation and application of tactical\r\nprinciples in the various armies, discussed in the light of the\r\ntactical views and methods prevailing in Germany, and amplified by\r\nnumerous examples from military history.\r\n\r\nThe professional value of this book to all officers of our Regular Army\r\nand Militia who are endeavoring to gain a working knowledge of tactics,\r\nis so obvious that any comment would be superfluous.\r\n\r\n  Army Service Schools,\r\n  Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas,\r\n  December, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first volume of “Tactics,” which appeared in its first edition\r\nin 1896, and for which the preparatory work reached back more than\r\na decade, now appears in its fourth edition in a completely changed\r\nform. The lessons gained in war and improvements in weapons have\r\ncorrected many earlier views. While the Boer war confused the views\r\non infantry combat and brought forth more lessons in a negative than\r\nin a positive form, the Russo-Japanese war has had a great educating\r\ninfluence, in that it corroborated the soundness of the lessons\r\ngained in the Franco-German war, but also in that it amplified those\r\nlessons commensurate with the improvements in weapons. The fundamental\r\nprinciples upon which success depends have remained the same.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I hesitated to comply with my publisher’s wishes for\r\na new edition. It would not have been difficult to publish long ago\r\na new edition, based upon the many lessons of war communicated to me\r\nby members of foreign armies soon after the Russo-Japanese war. But,\r\nafter an extended period of theoretical work, I was more inclined\r\nto avail myself once more of the opportunity of gaining practical\r\nexperience by service with troops. Pure theoretical reflection is only\r\ntoo apt to depart from the requirements of practice and to overlook\r\nthe friction appearing everywhere. The battalion commander, more than\r\nany one else, is called upon to act as the tactical instructor of his\r\nofficers and knows best where the shoe pinches. Moreover, the proximity\r\nof the maneuver ground to my present station gave me an opportunity\r\nof observing the field training of a large number of battalions\r\nand regiments of infantry and artillery, and to compare notes with\r\nbrother officers of the other arms. In addition, several trips abroad\r\nand, incidental thereto, visits to battlefields, furnished valuable\r\nsuggestions. I postponed issuing the new edition until the publication\r\nof the new Russian and Japanese Drill Regulations, which, with our\r\nown excellent regulations, best illustrate the lessons learned from\r\nthe war in the Far East. For this fourth edition I was further able\r\nto draw upon the new French (1904), Italian (1905), Belgian (1906),\r\nU. S. (1904), British (1905), and Swiss (1908) Drill Regulations.\r\nThis enumeration alone justifies the statement, “completely revised,”\r\nappearing on the title page.\r\n\r\nI have earnestly endeavored to make use of foreign experiences in\r\ndetail. The words of Lieutenant-General Sir Ian Hamilton of the\r\nBritish Army, to whose writings I owe a great deal, deserve special\r\nattention in studying the drill regulations of foreign armies: “It is\r\na blessing that the greater and prouder an army, the more immovably it\r\nis steeped in conservatism, so that as a whole it is finally incapable\r\nof assimilating the lessons gained by other armies. Military attachés\r\nmay discover the most important points in the training and employment\r\nof foreign armies and urgently recommend their imitation, but their\r\ncomrades will pay no more attention to them than did Napoleon III.\r\nto Stoffel’s reports on the Prussian army before the outbreak of the\r\nFranco-German war.”\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the subject matter has remained the same throughout;\r\nit represents, as in the first edition, the principle that tactical\r\nlessons must be deduced from human nature, from the effect of weapons,\r\nand from experience in war, proper regard being had for national\r\ncharacteristics and historical transmission. _Tactics is psychology._\r\nMy statements in regard to fire effect are based, as before, upon the\r\nworks of His Excellency, Lieutenant-General Rohne. The publications\r\nof Historical Section I of the Great General Staff and the splendid\r\nworks of the late Major Kunz, furnish the basis for examples cited\r\nfrom military history. An almost too copious literature is already\r\navailable on the Russo-Japanese war. The monographs (_Einzelschriften_)\r\nof the Great General Staff, and of Streffleur, especially “_Urteile und\r\nBeobachtungen von Mitkämpfern_,” published by the latter, afford a rich\r\nfield for research.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to cite examples from military history in support\r\nof any tactical procedure, but such examples require a very careful\r\nsifting before they can be recommended as worthy models for our action\r\nin front of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians deduced the necessity of the most brutal shock action\r\nfrom the experience gained by them in their combats in Upper Italy in\r\n1859, and the British were not very far removed from completely denying\r\nthe feasibility of making an attack soon after the Boer war; but the\r\ndesire to avoid losses was forced into the background by the necessity\r\nof annihilating the enemy. In the Far East the Russians finally had to\r\nlearn again the same bitter lessons as at Plevna.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with this fourth edition, there appears in Athens a\r\ntranslation in Modern Greek from the pen of Captain Strategos of the\r\nGreek General Staff, well known to many German officers from his War\r\nAcademy days.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the fourth edition may receive the same kind reception\r\nat home and abroad that was given its three predecessors. For all\r\ncommunications, suggestions or corrections, directed either to me or to\r\nmy publisher, I will be sincerely grateful.\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n  POSEN, March, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =INTRODUCTION.=\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n    =1.

WAR.\r\n\r\nClausewitz, in his work _On War_, defines war as “a continuation of\r\nstate policy by other means; an act of violence committed to force\r\nthe opponent to comply with our will.” The civil code is incapable\r\nof furnishing full satisfaction to individuals in cases of outraged\r\nhonor, and is obliged, under certain circumstances, to allow the\r\ninjured party to obtain such satisfaction by immediate chastisement of\r\nthe offender or by challenging him to a duel. In like manner there is\r\nno law which could afford nations complete satisfaction for affronts\r\nto their honor; and it is obvious that it would be as impossible to\r\nabolish war in the world, in the family of nations, as it would be to\r\nabolish dueling among the subjects of a state. The total abolition of\r\ndueling would produce the same results on the life of the individual\r\nthat the cessation of wars would produce on the development of the\r\nnational life of every state and on the intercourse of nations with\r\none another. “Eternal peace,” wrote Moltke on December 11th, 1880,\r\nto Professor Bluntschli, “is a dream, and not even a beautiful one;\r\nfor war is a part of God’s system in ruling the universe. In war, man\r\ndevelops the highest virtues; courage and unselfishness, devotion to\r\nduty and self-sacrifice even to death. Without war the world would\r\nstagnate in materialism.” Treitschke ventured a similar opinion in\r\n1869.[1] “Every nation, especially a refined and cultured one, is apt\r\nto lapse into effeminacy and selfishness during a protracted period\r\nof peace. The unlimited comfort enjoyed by society causes not only\r\nthe downfall of the state but destroys at the same time all those\r\nideals which make life worth living. Narrow provincialism or selfish\r\nand worldly activity, looking only toward the gratification of all\r\ndesires of the individual, undermines the foundations of a higher\r\nmoral philosophy and the belief in ideals. Fools arrive at the vain\r\nconclusion that the life object of the individual is acquisition and\r\nenjoyment; that the purpose of the state is simply to facilitate the\r\nbusiness affairs of its citizens; that man is appointed by an all-wise\r\nprovidence to buy cheaply and to sell at a profit; they conclude that\r\nwar, which interferes with man’s activities, is the greatest evil, and\r\nthat modern armies are only a sorry remnant of mediaeval barbarism.\r\n* * * It proves a positive blessing to such a generation if fate commits\r\nit to a great and righteous war, and the more it has become attached\r\nto the comfortable habits of mere social existence, the more violent\r\nthe reaction which rouses it to warlike deeds in the service of the\r\nstate. * * *” “The moment the state calls, ‘My life, my existence is at\r\nstake,’ there is aroused in a free people that highest of all virtues,\r\nthe courage of self-sacrifice, which can never exist in time of peace\r\nnor be developed to such an extent by peaceful pursuits. Millions\r\nare united in the one thought--the fatherland; they are animated by\r\nthat common sentiment of devotion unto death--patriotism--which, once\r\nexperienced, is never again forgotten, and which ennobles and hallows\r\nthe life of a whole generation. * * *” The greatness of war lies in\r\nthose very phases which an effeminate civilization deems impious. “A\r\ngreat nation must be powerful,” exclaimed Scherr, in 1870.[2] “That\r\nis not only its duty, but its nature. If opposition is encountered, a\r\nnation is not only permitted to force a way for its righteous cause and\r\nresort to war, but it is its duty to do so. War always has been, and,\r\nso long as men and nations exist on the earth, it always will be, the\r\n_ultima ratio_.”\r\n\r\n    [1] _Das konstitutionelle Königtum in Deutschland_, in _Historische\r\n  und politische Aufsätze_, New edition, II.\r\n\r\n    [2] _Das grosze Jahr_, in _Hammerschläge und Historien_.\r\n\r\nSince war is the _ultima ratio_ of state policy, and as a sovereign\r\nstate must insist on absolute independence in determining its affairs\r\nand its course of action, it follows that the verdict of a court of\r\narbitration, on the larger and more serious questions, can have a\r\ndecisive influence on the action of the contending parties only if\r\nthe arbitrator possesses the power to enforce his decision, and is\r\nembued with a determination to use that power. Thus the Pope was able\r\nto arbitrate the question of right between Germany and Spain as to the\r\npossession of the Caroline Islands, but a like verdict could never\r\ndecide the question of might between Germany and France as to the\r\npossession of Alsace-Lorraine.[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] The constitution of the old German Confederation provided for\r\n  a settlement of disputes arising among its members; this verdict was\r\n  to be enforced by summary proceedings when necessary. The war of\r\n  1866 proved that the paragraphs of the constitution mentioned, of\r\n  necessity had to fail the moment the vital interests of two powerful\r\n  states came into conflict. See VON LETTOW-VORBECK, _Geschichte des\r\n  Krieges von 1866_, I, p. 115.\r\n\r\nThe utopian plans for a universal international court of arbitration\r\nare chimerical and conjured up by idealists unacquainted with the harsh\r\nfacts of reality, if their ideas are not, indeed--as are many proposals\r\nfor disarmament--calculated to serve as a cloak for ambitious plans.\r\n\r\nIf diplomatic means do not suffice to adjust a dispute, then the\r\nquestion of right between two states at once becomes a question of\r\nmight. But the existence of a spirit of fair play is taken into account\r\nnevertheless, for each party to the controversy will seek to have\r\nthe justice of its cause recognized. The moral support engendered by\r\nfighting for a just cause is so great that no state is willing to\r\ndispense with it.[4] This circumstance, coupled with the growing power\r\nof public opinion and with the influence of representative government,\r\nhas contributed to reduce the number of wars. Wars between cabinets,\r\nlike those in the days of Louis XIV., are no longer possible. As a\r\nresult of the universal liability to service, the whole nation takes\r\npart in a war; every class of society suffers and has its pursuits\r\ninterfered with; everything presses to an early decision, to a prompt\r\ncrushing of the opponent.\r\n\r\n    [4] “If princes wish war they proceed to make war and then send for\r\n  an industrious jurist who demonstrates that it is therefore right.”\r\n  FREDERICK II.\r\n\r\n    “Every war is just which is necessary and every battle holy in\r\n  which lies our last hope.” MACHIAVELLI, _Il Principe_.\r\n\r\nThis is attained by defeating the enemy’s forces, by occupying the\r\nhostile country and seizing the enemy’s sources of supply, so that he\r\nwill be convinced of the futility of further resistance. (Campaigns of\r\n1859, 1866, and 1870-71). Only in the rarest cases will it be necessary\r\nto continue the war until the power of resistance of the hostile state\r\nis completely destroyed. (American Civil War). The extent to which the\r\nenemy’s power of resistance may have to be crippled or broken, in order\r\nto compel peace, depends upon his tenacity. Political considerations\r\nwill also have to be taken into account in answering this question.\r\nFrom the military point of view, however, the purpose of every war will\r\nalways be the complete overthrow of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. STRATEGY AND TACTICS.\r\n\r\nPrecise definitions of strategy and tactics, clearly fixing the scope\r\nof each, have been vainly sought in the past. That efforts in this\r\ndirection have led to no results is only natural, as tactics and\r\nstrategy are complementary subjects that often encroach upon each\r\nother, while grand tactics is frequently identical with strategy.\r\n\r\nVon Bülow, the author of _The Spirit of Modern Warfare_ (1798)[5],\r\ncalls those movements strategical which are made outside the enemy’s\r\nsphere of information. Von Willisen considers strategy the science\r\nof communications, tactics the science of fighting. Von Clausewitz\r\ncalls strategy the science of the use of battles for the purpose of\r\nthe war (Jomini: “_l’art de diriger les armées sur les théatres\r\nd’opérations_”)[6], tactics the science of the use of military forces\r\nin battle (Jomini: “_l’art de diriger les troupes sur les champs de\r\nbataille_”).[7][8] General von Horsetzki (1892) defines strategy as the\r\nstudy of the conditions necessary for success in war. Archduke Charles\r\ncalls strategy the “science of war” and tactics the “art of war”.\r\nFrederick the Great and Napoleon always employed the term “_l’art de\r\nguerre_” instead of the term “_strategy_”. None of these definitions\r\nare comprehensive enough, because they do not cover marches, outposts,\r\nthe supply service, and enterprises in minor tactics. Professor\r\nDelbrück’s definition is much more appropriate: “Strategy is the\r\nscience of utilizing military resources for the attainment of the\r\nobject of the war, tactics the art of leading troops into and in\r\nbattle.” Thiers, the French historian, instead of seeking to define\r\nstrategy and tactics, contents himself with explaining the problems\r\nof each: “_Le stratège doit concevoir le plan de campagne, embrasser\r\nd’un seul coup d’oeil tout le théatre présumé de la guerre, tracer\r\nlignes d’opérations et diriger les masses sur les points décisifs. Le\r\ntacticien a pour mission de régler l’ordre de leurs marches, de les\r\ndisposer en bataille aux différents points, indiqués par le stratège,\r\nd’engager l’action, de la soutenir et de manoeuvrer pour atteindre le\r\nbut proposé._”[9] Fieldmarshal Moltke calls strategy “the application\r\nof common sense to the conduct of war.”[10] For practical purposes it\r\nis sufficient to define strategy as the _science of the conduct of\r\nwar_, tactics as the _science of troop-leading_. Strategy brings about\r\nthe decision on the theater of war, while the duty of carrying it out,\r\nin the manner desired by the commander-in-chief, devolves upon tactics.\r\nThus the strategical idea culminates on the battlefield. The concentric\r\nadvance of the Prussian armies into Bohemia in 1866 naturally led to a\r\ncomplete envelopment of the Austrians on the field of Königgrätz. The\r\nGerman attack in the battle on the Hallue, Dec. 23rd, 1870, was based\r\non the strategical requirement of driving the French from their line of\r\nretreat leading to Arras and Bapaume, by enveloping their right flank.\r\nThe attempts made by the 15th Infantry Division, which was holding the\r\nenemy in front, to envelop the left wing of the French, interfered\r\nwith the execution of the correct strategical plan. Thus, in following\r\nup a success, in itself quite unimportant (the capture of Bussy), the\r\nleading basic principle was forgotten. The same thing happened here\r\nthat Moltke censured in his official report on the war of 1866, wherein\r\nhe stated: “The higher commanders have not been able to make their\r\ninfluence felt down to the subordinate grades. Frequently, as soon as\r\nthe divisions and brigades have come in contact with the enemy, all\r\ncontrol over them has entirely ceased.”\r\n\r\n    [5] _Geist des neueren Kriegssystems._\r\n\r\n    [6] “The art of directing armies In the theater of operations.”\r\n\r\n    [7] “The art of directing troops on the field of battle.”\r\n\r\n    [8] “Everything affecting the use of troops in battle and the\r\n  regulation of their activity with reference to battle, has been\r\n  included in the term ‘tactics’, while the term strategy is synonymous\r\n  with ‘generalship,’ exclusive of such matters as fall into the domain\r\n  of tactics.” BLUME, _Strategie_, p. 33.\r\n\r\n    “Tactics teaches _how_, and strategy _why_, one should fight.”\r\n  General V. SCHERFF.\r\n\r\n    Strategy determines direction and objective of the movement of\r\n  armies, while the manner of execution belongs to tactics.\r\n\r\n    [9] “Strategy should devise the plan of campaign, take in with a\r\n  comprehensive glance the entire probable theater of war, establish\r\n  the lines of operations and direct the masses on the decisive points.\r\n\r\n    “It is the mission of the tactician to decide upon the order of\r\n  march of the troops, to form them for battle at the various points\r\n  determined by strategy, to begin the action, to sustain it, and to\r\n  maneuver so as to attain the desired end.” THIERS.\r\n\r\n    [10] V. MOLTKE, _Tactical Problems, No. 58_ (1878) p. 133.\r\n\r\nArchduke Charles considered the subordination of tactics to strategy\r\na law. “Tactics should execute the conceptions of strategy; where the\r\ntwo come in conflict, where strategical considerations are opposed to\r\ntactical interests, the strategical considerations should, as a rule,\r\ntake precedence. Tactics must occupy a subordinate place and attempt to\r\nneutralize existing disadvantages by skillful dispositions.” Clausewitz\r\nnot unjustly censures Archduke Charles for placing advantages of\r\nterrain in the first rank, and for failing to attach the proper\r\nimportance to the annihilation of the hostile forces. Should the\r\ndemands of strategy conflict with those of tactics on the battlefield,\r\nthe latter must unquestionably take precedence, since the general’s\r\nforemost thought must be the annihilation of the hostile forces.\r\nTactical considerations should likewise govern in the selection of the\r\ndirection of attack in a battle, strategical reasons for striking in\r\nthis or that direction becoming effective only after the attainment of\r\ntactical success. It is true that strategy, by directing the armies and\r\ntheir concentration on the battlefield, provides tactics with the tools\r\nfor fighting and assures the probability of victory; but, on the other\r\nhand, the commander-in-chief appropriates the fruits of each victory\r\nand makes them the basis for further plans. “The demands of strategy\r\nare silent in the presence of tactical victory; they adapt themselves\r\nto the newly created situation.” Fieldmarshal MOLTKE.[11]\r\n\r\n    [11] The view that the direction of attack should be governed by\r\n  the possibility of easy execution in minor warfare only, is held by\r\n  General v. Scherff, who says: “General v. Moltke was not influenced\r\n  by the question ‘will the attack here or there be tactically\r\n  easier or more difficult?’ Only the question, ‘will it there be\r\n  strategically advantageous or not’ was able to determine his course\r\n  with reference to measures on the battlefield.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE METHOD OF INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nWhile Archduke Charles considers mathematical axioms the basis of the\r\nhigher art of war, military history is for us the principal source from\r\nwhich to gather knowledge.[12]\r\n\r\n    [12] See lecture by Prince HOHENLOHE: _Kriegserfahrung und\r\n  Kriegsgeschichte_, Neisse, 1879.\r\n\r\n    “Let my son often read and meditate upon history; it is the only\r\n  true philosophy. Let him often read and meditate upon the wars of the\r\n  great captains; it is the only means of learning the art of war.”\r\n  NAPOLEON I., on April 17th, 1821.\r\n\r\n    “Past events are useful to feed the imagination and furnish the\r\n  memory, provided their study is the repetition of ideas that judgment\r\n  should pass upon.” FREDERICK THE GREAT.\r\n\r\nIn military history we have a guide by which, if we lack personal\r\nexperience in war, we can test the results of our reflections and of\r\nour experience on the drillground. Military history moreover enables\r\nus to appreciate those controlling factors which, in map problems,\r\ndo not appear at all, and which, in exercises on the terrain, appear\r\nonly in a restricted measure. One must learn the conduct of war from\r\nthe experience of others; one’s own experience is costly and is almost\r\ninvariably gained too late. That experience in war, of itself, is\r\nnot sufficient (aside from the fact that it is gained too late in a\r\ngiven case) is illustrated by the defeat of the Austrians in 1866,\r\nof the French in 1870-71, and of the British in South Africa. “_Les\r\nAutrichiens_,” says Colonel Foch,[13] “_ont fait la guerre sans la\r\ncomprendre, les Prussiens l’ont compris sans la faire, mais ils l’ont\r\nétudiée._” “Military history is neither a compilation of clever\r\ntheories nor a book designed for whiling away idle moments. It is,\r\non the contrary, a careful teacher, who, if we are attentive, allows\r\nus to view and grasp matters which we have never before been in a\r\nposition to see, but which, nevertheless, are liable to confront us\r\nin the same, a similar, or a changed form, and demand unpremeditated,\r\ninstant and decisive action, entailing heavy responsibilities. Military\r\nhistory, it is true, offers us, in the first instance, only events and\r\ntheir outline, conditions and phenomena, but it also presents, what\r\nthe cleverest theory is unable to furnish, a graphic illustration of\r\nthe disturbing elements in war, an illustration of the influences,\r\ndoubts, embarrassments, unforeseen accidents, surprises and delays. It\r\ndescribes the course pursued by commanders and by practical military\r\ncommon sense in surmounting these difficulties. It prepares in advance\r\nthe mental balance necessary at the moment of action; it should prepare\r\nalso for the unexpected. It affords a substitute for lack of military\r\nexperience, for the accumulation of which the life of the individual,\r\nprior to the moment of action, has been too short.”[14] The pedantic\r\nenumeration of a few examples in support of a stated opinion cannot\r\nsuffice. It should not be difficult to find examples from military\r\nhistory in support of any opinion; frequently even an incorrect\r\ntactical contention can be vindicated by such examples. For in war\r\nthe action taken is as often wrong as correct; the scales are turned\r\nby factors which in most cases appear indistinctly or not at all. The\r\nexperiences of military history must, therefore, only be used with\r\ncaution if tactical lessons are to be drawn from them. “A mere allusion\r\nto historical events,” says Clausewitz in his chapter on examples, “has\r\nthe further disadvantage that some readers are either not sufficiently\r\nacquainted with these events, or remember them too imperfectly to enter\r\ninto the author’s ideas, so that such students are compelled to accept\r\nhis statements blindly or to remain unconvinced. It is, of course, very\r\ndifficult to describe historical events as they ought to be described\r\nif they are to be used as proofs, for authors usually lack the means,\r\nas well as the time and space, necessary for such descriptions. We\r\nmaintain, however, that in establishing a new or a doubtful view, a\r\nsingle event, thoroughly described, is more instructive than a mere\r\nallusion to ten. The principal evil resulting from a superficial\r\nreference to historical events does not lie in the fact that the author\r\ncites them incorrectly in support of his theory, but in the fact\r\nthat he has never become thoroughly acquainted with those events. In\r\nconsequence of such a superficial, haphazard treatment of history, a\r\nhundred erroneous views and theoretical projects are created, which\r\nwould never have appeared if the author had been compelled to deduce,\r\nfrom a careful analysis of the connected facts in the case, what he\r\npublishes and wishes to support by historical proofs. If we have\r\nconvinced ourselves of the above outlined difficulties attending the\r\nemployment of historical examples, and appreciate the necessity for\r\nthoroughness in their treatment, we will come to the conclusion that\r\nthe more recent military history is the most natural source from which\r\nto select examples, inasmuch as recent history alone is sufficiently\r\nknown and analyzed.”[15] The events from military history mentioned in\r\nthis work are cited simply as proofs of certain phenomena; the proper\r\nanalysis of these proofs must be left to the student.\r\n\r\n    [13] _Principes de la Guerre_, 1903.\r\n\r\n    “The Austrians,” says Colonel Foch, “made war without understanding\r\n  it; the Germans understood war without making it; but they studied\r\n  it.”\r\n\r\n    [14] From _Meinungen und Mahnungen_, Vienna, 1894.\r\n\r\n    [15] _On War_, II, Chapter 6, p. 111.\r\n\r\n    See also CLAUSEWITZ’ remarks on “_Criticism_,” II, Chapter 5.\r\n\r\nThe applicatory method[16] is used frequently by preference as the\r\nsystem of instruction, but its creator, General von Verdy du Vernois,\r\nconsiders it merely a complement of the deductive method, on which\r\nit is predicated and based. “The weakness of the whole applicatory\r\nsystem of instruction lies in the fact that a textbook based upon it,\r\nalthough written by a master hand, can portray only isolated examples,\r\nand that these, studied again and again, soon lose their value in the\r\nsame manner as a maneuver terrain that has become too well known. For,\r\nalthough we ordinarily find principles represented in a connected\r\nform, this method of instruction can only convey them in a fragmentary\r\nmanner in connection with the details of the events described.”[17]\r\nThe success of the applicatory method depends largely upon the\r\nindividuality of the instructor, and owes its charm to the personal\r\nintercourse between teacher and pupil. Only an expert, who possesses a\r\nthorough professional knowledge, who is master of his subject, and who\r\nhas the faculty of presenting it skillfully, will be able to produce\r\nimaginary scenes which faithfully represent reality and are free from\r\nobjectionable features. By constant practice with specific cases, under\r\nthe most diverse situations, the nature of war may in this way be\r\ntaught and initiative developed as well as facility acquired in issuing\r\nappropriate, clear, and concise orders. One danger of using nothing but\r\nthe applicatory method must be noted. The instructor, as representative\r\nof a definite theory, finds it comparatively easy to select the\r\nconditions governing a specific case in such a way that the theory\r\nwhich he represents necessarily appears to be the correct one. This is\r\nespecially true when the director of an applicatory problem determines\r\nthe action of the opposing side. The two methods (the applicatory, or\r\ninductive, and the deductive) must be so supplemented that the lesson\r\nin tactics clearly illustrates the purpose and object of a tactical\r\noperation and allows of the attainment of a thorough knowledge of the\r\nmeans necessary to gain that object.[18] “He who is able to understand\r\nthe situation, has a definite purpose in view, and knows the means with\r\nwhich to carry out that purpose, will, by a simple mental operation,\r\narrive in each particular case at an appropriate decision, and will be\r\nable, furthermore, to carry out that decision, provided he does not\r\nlose his head. If a clear comprehension of the purpose in view and\r\nof the means for carrying out that purpose lie within the sphere of\r\ntheory, the estimate of the situation and the decision are governed by\r\nthe circumstances of the particular case. Should the training in this\r\ndirection lie outside the sphere of theory, it will logically belong to\r\nthe domain of the applicatory method of instruction. The two methods\r\nmust, therefore, supplement each other.\r\n\r\n    [16] See KÜHNE, _Kritische Wanderungen_, 4 and 5, Preface p. 5.\r\n\r\n    [17] VON BOGUSLAWSKI, _Entwickelung der Taktik_, II, p. 17.\r\n\r\n    [18] “When one attempts to establish a principle, immediately\r\n  a great number of officers, imagining that they are solving the\r\n  question, at once cry out: ‘Everything depends on circumstances;\r\n  according to the wind must the sails be set.’ But if you do not know\r\n  beforehand which sail is proper for such and such a wind, how can you\r\n  set the sail according to the wind?” BUGEAUD, _Aperçus sur quelques\r\n  détails de guerre_.\r\n\r\nIf the decision is to culminate in action, strength of character\r\nis required, providing the determination to execute, in spite of\r\nunavoidable difficulties, what has been recognized as proper, and also\r\nthe professional ability necessary to carry out the determination to\r\nits logical conclusion. All that theory can do toward forming this\r\ncharacter is to emphasize its importance and to refer students to\r\nmilitary history. The applicatory method, however, can develop strength\r\nof character by compelling the student to form decisions under pressure\r\nof a specified time limit (in solving problems) or by subjecting him to\r\nthe influences of certain situations such as would be encountered in\r\nwar (maneuvers). The means available in tactical instruction in time\r\nof peace, for the development of strength of character, are, however,\r\nvery limited when compared with the great demands made by the abnormal\r\nconditions of war, so out of all proportion to those of peace. This\r\nshould be thoroughly understood, lest we overestimate the value of\r\nthese means as well as the results to be obtained from them in times of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAfter theory has fulfilled its mission of clearly indicating the\r\npurpose and object of an operation, as well as the means by which it\r\nmay be attained, and applicatory practice has performed its office\r\nof developing initiative and professional skill, a third factor is\r\nstill necessary--the study of military history. From this fountain\r\nof knowledge both “theory” and “applicatory method” must draw their\r\nmaterial; to this source they must again and again refer in order to\r\nguard against erroneous ideas of their own creation, which are often as\r\ndifferent from reality as day is from night.”[19]\r\n\r\n    [19] F. C. V. H. (_Fieldmarshal Lieutenant General_ CONRAD V.\r\n  HÖTZENDORF, Chief of Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army). _Zum\r\n  Studium der Taktik_, p. 2.\r\n\r\nViewed as the science of the leading and employment of troops, tactics\r\nmay be divided into two parts:\r\n\r\n1. =Formal tactics=, or that contained in drill regulations. This\r\nportion of tactics furnishes the formations used by troops when\r\nassembled, on the march, and in action, and contains the regulations\r\ngoverning the conduct in battle of troops acting alone without regard\r\nto the coöperation of the other arms, and without reference to the\r\nterrain.\r\n\r\n2. =Applied tactics=[20] deals with the combined action of the several\r\narms on the march, in camp, and in action, taking into account\r\ninfluences of the terrain, seasons, and the time of day in field\r\nwarfare. Fortress warfare should, strictly speaking, be included under\r\nthis heading; that is to say, the employment of tactical principles[21]\r\npertaining to the mobile arms, in conjunction with foot-artillery and\r\ntechnical troops on a prepared battlefield. The principles are the\r\nsame in field and fortress warfare; the only difference between them\r\nlies in the employment of the means necessitated by the preparation\r\nof a field of battle in time of peace. Military history shows that a\r\nclear distinction between field and fortress warfare is impossible.\r\n(Sebastopol, Düppel, Plevna, and Port Arthur).\r\n\r\n    [20] V. BOGUSLAWSKI, _Entwickelung der Taktik_, II, Chapter\r\n  23. “The higher, Grand Tactics, is the Initiation and conduct of\r\n  battles--subordinate, or minor tactics, is the manner of fighting, or\r\n  the battle-tactics of an arm considered in its details.”\r\n\r\n    [21] MAJOR GUNDELACH, _Exerzierreglement und Festungskrieg_,\r\n  Berlin, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DRILL REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nDrill regulations are the accumulation of the tactical views and\r\nlessons of a certain period. They illustrate the tactical condition\r\nwhich becomes perceptible at the moment of a certain development of\r\nthe fighting tools as represented by man and weapons. Man, in his\r\npeculiarities, in his weaknesses, is the constant. He constitutes the\r\npsychological element, inseparable from the science of combat, and\r\nas such is the definitely given magnitude; the effect of weapons,\r\nhowever, appears always as the variable factor. New weapons, therefore,\r\nnecessitate new tactics.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed also “that changes of tactics have not only taken\r\nplace _after_ changes in weapons, which necessarily is the case, but\r\nthat the interval between such changes has been unduly long. This\r\ndoubtless arises from the fact that an improvement of weapons is due to\r\nthe energy of one or two men, while changes in tactics have to overcome\r\nthe inertia of a conservative class; but it is a great evil. It can be\r\nremedied only by a candid recognition of each change.”[22] The history\r\nof the tactics of the 19th Century furnishes more than one instructive\r\nexample of the magnitude of such “obstinate conservatism.”\r\n\r\n    [22] MAHAN, _The Influence of Sea Power upon History_, pp. 9 and 10.\r\n\r\nIt is a marked peculiarity of manuals of instruction, that, no\r\nmatter with what far-sightedness such regulations may have been\r\noriginally compiled, they become antiquated in a comparatively short\r\ntime. Napoleon estimated this period at ten years. Frequent changes\r\nare certainly not desirable, if tactical development is not to be\r\ninterfered with and if inconveniences are to be avoided in organizing\r\nour mobile army from our peace organizations, Reservists, and Landwehr.\r\nOn the other hand, the regulations must keep abreast of requirements\r\nif the conditions to which they owe their existence have changed. In\r\nhis “Military Fantasies” the Prince de Ligne wrote in 1783: “An article\r\nwhich should be added to all drill regulations, and which, I know not\r\nwhy, is omitted, is: ‘Act sometimes contrary to the regulations.’\r\nIt is just as necessary to teach that one must act contrary to the\r\nregulations, as to teach the disorder of troops as it will occur in\r\naction.”\r\n\r\nIt is always dangerous to be behind the times, as troops thereby\r\nrelinquish a superiority previously possessed over others, which\r\nknowledge they must later purchase, with streams of blood, in the face\r\nof hostile bullets. Of what avail, to the Austrians in 1866, to the\r\nRussians in 1877, were all their valiant assaults, made with tactical\r\nformations that had outlived their usefulness in the face of newer\r\nweapons, although made with the firm determination to conquer?\r\n\r\nThe self-sacrificing spirit and firmly rooted discipline of the\r\ntroops found an insurmountable obstacle in the rapid fire of unshaken\r\ninfantry. The war experiences of our regiments show that bullets\r\nquickly write a new tactics, demolish superannuated formations and\r\ncreate new ones. But at what a sacrifice![23] In the Franco-German\r\nwar, superior leadership and a better artillery permitted us to pay\r\nthis price for the lesson. But how an army fares when it lacks these\r\nauxiliaries is shown by the British experiences in South Africa. The\r\ninitial failure of accustomed tactical formations causes a dread of the\r\nfrontal attack and finally leads some tacticians to deny entirely even\r\nthe feasibility of such an attack. In peace training, therefore, set\r\nforms are of less importance; stress should be laid on developing the\r\nfaculty of adaptation to changing conditions of combat and terrain.\r\n\r\n    [23] It is frequently customary on the outbreak of a war to issue\r\n  “Instructions for campaign,” in order to prepare troops, trained\r\n  according to superannuated regulations, for action on a strange\r\n  theater of war. It is desirable to disseminate the first experiences\r\n  gained in action to all parts of the army. We failed to do this in\r\n  1870, and all organizations were therefore compelled to gain this\r\n  experience for themselves. Even as late as the 18th of August, 1870,\r\n  the Füsilier Battalion of the 85th Infantry advanced in double\r\n  column formed on the center, although the campaign in Bohemia had\r\n  already demonstrated that this formation was out of date. See MOLTKE,\r\n  _Feldzug von 1859_, p. 65.\r\n\r\nFurther development and justification of the principles of the drill\r\nregulations, and the modification of those principles under certain\r\nassumptions, are reserved to the science of tactics. Drill regulations\r\nshould not be textbooks of tactics, but, on the other hand, a textbook\r\nof tactics should deal with formations only in so far as that is\r\nnecessary to ensure a clear comprehension of the fundamental principles.\r\n\r\n“Regulations and the science of combat are in a certain sense very\r\ndifferent subjects. The regulations are law, authority--no doubt can\r\nbe entertained on this point; but that also invests them with the\r\ncharacter of something fixed, at least for a certain space of time.\r\nThey cannot be kept up to date so as to meet quickly enough the rapidly\r\nchanging and ever growing demands of modern combat: that would indeed\r\nbe an unfair requirement, impossible of realization. Here must enter\r\nthe science of combat, which should be independent in every direction,\r\nwhich should know no fixed rules, and which should point to no other\r\nauthority than that of truth and reality. It is not the province of\r\nthe science of combat, like that of regulations, to retain that which\r\nis in keeping with prevailing views and forms; it must take into\r\nconsideration the fleeting theory and practice, ever developing and\r\nchanging anew.”[24]\r\n\r\n    [24] KEIM, _Gegenwärtiger Stand der Gefechtslehre_, p. 1.\r\n\r\nA positive system of tactics will therefore be based upon one’s own\r\ndrill regulations, from the standpoint of which it will investigate\r\nand compare the principles of the service manuals of the different\r\npowers, and finally develop the science still further by the aid of\r\nexperience gained from military history and the knowledge of the\r\neffect of weapons. While these are the ever changing but nevertheless\r\nmeasurable factors of tactical reflection, a third, perhaps the most\r\nimportant factor, must be added, viz., that the leader must reckon\r\nwith the action of men frequently exposed to the influence of great\r\nexertions and great mental agitation. _A doctrine of tactics which does\r\nnot properly appreciate the psychological element stagnates in lifeless\r\npedantry._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORMAL TACTICS OF INFANTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ORGANIZATION AND EQUIPMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE IMPORTANCE AND EMPLOYMENT OF INFANTRY.\r\n\r\nIn all modern armies infantry is, in virtue of its numbers and\r\nimportance, the principal arm. Since the introduction of firearms,\r\ninfantry has gradually increased in importance and numbers as compared\r\nwith the other arms.\r\n\r\n  In the Thirty Years’ war, the proportion of cavalry to infantry was\r\n  as 1:1, or 1:2, and frequently the cavalry even predominated. In\r\n  the Swedish army one gun per 1,000 men was considered sufficient.\r\n  During the era of linear tactics in the 18th Century the proportion\r\n  between the two principal arms had become as 1:2 and 1:3; in the\r\n  Napoleonic wars as 1:6 and 1:8. The number of guns was increased to 4\r\n  per 1,000 men. In the course of a campaign the ratio changes to the\r\n  disadvantage of infantry. At the outbreak of the war of 1870-71, the\r\n  relative proportions of the three arms in the German IInd Army were\r\n  as follows: cavalry to infantry as 1:8; and 3.4 guns per 1,000 men.\r\n  The proportion between the two principal arms in the IIIrd Army Corps\r\n  of the German army, at the outbreak of the Franco-German war, was as\r\n  1:18.8; on the first day of the battle of Le Mans it was as 1:16.6;\r\n  at the opening of the campaign there were 4.6 guns per 1,000 men, at\r\n  the close of the campaign 5.8 guns per 1,000 men. This was still more\r\n  marked in the Ist Bavarian Army Corps, which, on October 31st, had\r\n  5.8 guns and on December 9th even 11.1 guns per 1,000 men. At present\r\n  Germany has approximately 6, and France 3.63 guns per 1,000 infantry.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which infantry fights imprints its distinguishing mark\r\non the tactics of an entire period; thus, according to the combat\r\nformations of infantry, we may speak of a period of “linear,” “column,”\r\nand “extended order” tactics. Infantry can be equipped more cheaply and\r\ntrained more quickly than the other arms. In July, 1870, the French\r\narmy consisted of 116 infantry regiments and 21 rifle battalions,\r\nbut 38 rifle battalions were raised in addition to a large number of\r\nregiments of _gardes mobiles_ and volunteers.\r\n\r\nInfantry is as well adapted for combat with firearms as for combat\r\nwith the bayonet, for attack as for defense, for action in close as in\r\nextended order. It can fight on any terrain which is at all passable,\r\nand is more independent of weather and seasons than the other arms; it\r\nsurpasses the other arms in endurance, a man, on account of his will\r\npower, bearing privations and exertions better than a horse. On the\r\nother hand, the losses suffered by foot troops in action and through\r\nexertions on the march are greater than those of the mounted arms.[25]\r\n\r\n    [25] Percentages of cases of sickness in the campaign 1870/71:\r\n\r\n  Infantry:  69.8; Field Officers: 13.26; Captains: 10.19;\r\n  Lieutenants: 3.85%\r\n  Artillery: 57.7;   „       „      4.04;     „      4.84;\r\n  Lieutenants: 4.52„\r\n  Cavalry:   37.5;   „       „      5.61;     „      2.29;\r\n  Lieutenants: 3.24„\r\n\r\nThe rate of march of infantry is so slow that in reconnaissance it\r\ncan only by great exertions attain results which a small force of\r\ncavalry would obtain without appreciable effort. Infantry acting alone\r\ntherefore unquestionably requires the assignment of mounted men for\r\nreconnaissance and messenger duty. As regards reconnaissance, infantry\r\nis like a man walking in the dark, who can guard against collisions\r\nonly by stretching out his hand and feeling his way.\r\n\r\nThe lack of artillery support will also make itself felt when infantry\r\nencounters fire at ranges at which it is defenseless, owing to the\r\nlimited range of its rifle. Infantry cannot dispense with artillery\r\nwhen it has to attack localities or fortified points in villages.\r\n\r\nThe infantry of the 19th Century fell heir to the distinction made\r\nin the 18th Century between heavy infantry (infantry of the line)\r\nand light infantry, the latter being employed only in skirmish duty\r\nand in the service of security. In the 18th Century the expensive\r\nmethod of recruiting by means of bounties made it necessary to avoid\r\nusing troops in indecisive, costly fire actions, and to preserve the\r\nexpensive personnel for decisive shock action _en masse_. Skirmishing\r\nwas left to volunteer battalions, to Jägers, and to Füsiliers. In\r\nPrussia the number of Füsilier battalions was increased to 24 at the\r\nclose of the 18th Century. Napoleon I. was, on principle, opposed\r\nto the theory of light infantry. He demanded but one species of\r\ninfantry, “a good infantry.” In spite of this, however, he became the\r\noriginator of an _élite_ infantry, when, for reasons of discipline, he\r\ncreated one _voltigeur_ and one _grenadier_ company in each battalion.\r\nWhile battalion tactics predominated, _i.e._, until the close of the\r\ncampaign of 1866, this arrangement was imitated in most states. At\r\nthe time of the Russo-Turkish war, Russia still had in each battalion\r\na fifth company, one of sharpshooters, which, though not recruited\r\nat the expense of the other companies, was formed of better material\r\nand received special training in extended order fighting. Following\r\nthe example set by Austria, Prussia, in 1812, designated the third\r\nrank principally for extended order fighting, by forming it into a\r\nthird platoon in each company when in action. This was called the\r\nsharpshooters’ platoon and was composed of the best shots and the\r\nmost skillful men of the company. As late as the campaign of 1866\r\nthere were instances of the employment of the combined sharpshooter\r\nplatoons of a battalion. Here we have an actual _élite_ force assembled\r\nin provisional organizations, not at the expense of the rest of the\r\ntroops, however.\r\n\r\nThe system of column tactics, which required that every company should\r\nbe equally skilled in extended order fighting, led to the abolishment\r\nof _élite_ companies. The Prussian _élite_, consisting of the platoons\r\nformed from the third rank, although not always compatible with the\r\nemployment of company columns, was not abolished until 1876. The\r\nexperience of the Franco-German war had shown that, in view of the\r\nextensive use of extended order formations, an independent employment\r\nof single platoons was out of the question, as in the course of an\r\naction the firing line absorbs not only entire companies, but regiments\r\nand brigades; and, moreover, that every platoon, as a unit for fire\r\naction, must possess those elements which will carry it forward even\r\nafter its leader has fallen.\r\n\r\nNapoleon formed his Guards by selecting men and officers from the\r\nentire army for use as a battle reserve. By granting them privileges\r\nand by loading them with distinctions, he attached them to his person,\r\nand they assumed the character of household troops of a dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian and Russian Guards are differently constituted. They are\r\nnot, strictly speaking, _corps d’élite_, for they are not selected\r\nfrom the ranks of the army. While it is true that the Prussian Guard\r\nreceives a better class of recruits and the composition of its corps\r\nof officers and the selection of its commanders guarantee conspicuous\r\nresults, its principal superiority lies in the fact that it serves\r\nconstantly under the eye of the emperor.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of accurate breechloading weapons, and their\r\nuse by all infantry, Jägers and riflemen have no tactical excuse for\r\nexisting, except where they are specially trained in mountain warfare\r\n(_Chasseurs alpins_, _Alpini_)[26], or where they are intended to serve\r\nas a support for cavalry divisions. (France). While Jäger-battalions\r\nare at present employed like the rest of the infantry, they are\r\nretained by us as such because of tradition and for reasons of\r\norganization (they are recruited from forestry personnel), and an\r\nattempt is made in their tactical employment to turn their excellent\r\nmarksmanship and skill in the use of ground to good account whenever\r\npossible. Jägers will be employed in defense, preferably for holding\r\nimportant points, and for combat and service of security on difficult\r\nterrain. Military experience has shown, however, that in actual war it\r\nwas seldom possible to take advantage of these special characteristics;\r\nthat in most cases the Jägers were used as other infantry, and that\r\ninfantry units fighting shoulder to shoulder with Jägers accomplished\r\nas good results as the latter. Since the war of 1866 the demand for\r\nspecial employment of Jägers has ceased. The brief course of the\r\ncampaign of 1866, in which our infantry acted mostly on the offensive,\r\ngave the Jägers an opportunity for profitable employment only where,\r\ncontrary to accepted notions, they fought side by side with the rest of\r\nthe infantry.[27]\r\n\r\n    [26] See _Über Gebirgstruppen_, VI, p. 273, and also\r\n  _Schweizerische Monatsschrift für Offiziere aller Waffen_, 1907, May\r\n  to July.\r\n\r\n    V. GRAEVENITZ, _Beiheft zum Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1903.\r\n\r\n    [27] The 6th Jäger-Battalion on July 3rd at Sendrasitz; the 4th\r\n  Jäger-Battalion at Podol; the 5th at Skalitz; the Jägers of the\r\n  Guard at Lipa; or where during an action a reverse threw us on the\r\n  defensive (1st Jäger-Battalion at Trautenau, and also at Rosberitz).\r\n  The superior commanders, in attempting to assign them a special role,\r\n  frequently employed them unprofitably in taking up rallying positions\r\n  (3rd, 7th, and 8th Jäger-Battalions on July 3rd), sometimes even to\r\n  escort baggage (3rd and 4th Companies of the Jägers of the Guard at\r\n  Soor; and the 1st and 4th Companies of the 5th Jäger-Battalion at\r\n  Schweinschädel); or they distributed them along the whole front for\r\n  the purpose of conducting extended order fighting. When they were\r\n  thus distributed among infantry organizations their efforts merged\r\n  with those of the infantry.\r\n\r\n    For example, at Königgrätz half companies of Jägers were posted\r\n  on both flanks of the Guard Infantry Division, and the 2nd\r\n  Jäger-Battalion was on this day distributed by companies along the\r\n  front of the entire division.\r\n\r\n    V. MOLTKE, _Kritische Aufsätze zur Geschichte des Feldzuges von\r\n  1866_.\r\n\r\n    KUNZ, _Die Tätigkeit der deutschen Jäger-Bataillone im Kriege\r\n  1870/71_. On page 169, et seq., a number of excellent examples are\r\n  recorded (for instance: 5th Prussian Jäger-Battalion in the actions\r\n  on November 29th and 30th, 1870, and on January 19th, 1871, in siege\r\n  positions in front of Paris).\r\n\r\nMountain warfare presents such difficult problems to troops,\r\nrequires a sum total of endurance, energy and intelligence, physical\r\nqualifications and special familiarity, that neither every recruit nor\r\nevery unit of the army will quite fulfill all its demands, although\r\nthe experience of Suworov, during his campaign in the Alps, apparently\r\ncontradicts this statement. Many disadvantages can be neutralized by\r\npeace training and discipline, of course, but training alone will not\r\nsuffice. For overcoming the difficulties peculiar to mountain warfare,\r\na suitable equipment permitting free movement, and at the same time\r\nensuring the comfort of the men while at rest, is necessary. The\r\nlack of such mountain equipment is keenly felt even during short\r\nexercises lasting only a few days. Even Switzerland plans at present\r\nthe formation of three mountain brigades. Austria already has special\r\nmountain brigades assembled for mountain warfare in its Kaiser-Jäger,\r\nRural Riflemen, and also in the troops of Bosnia and Dalmatia. The\r\nItalian _Alpini_ (consisting of 22 battalions in time of peace, to\r\nwhich militia companies are attached on mobilization, and which have\r\nin addition a reserve of 22 territorial companies) form a selected\r\ncorps which is doubtless capable of accomplishing excellent results.\r\nThe Italians propose to attach machine guns to these units. It is\r\nworthy of note that these troops carry explosives. In France the troops\r\ngarrisoned in the Alpine districts are divided into thirteen groups,\r\neach consisting of one battalion, one mountain battery, one engineer\r\ncompany, and machine guns.\r\n\r\nAs modern fire effect makes it impossible for mounted officers to\r\ndirect the firing line, it was natural to use the more improved means\r\nof communication, the telephone and telegraph, in addition to the\r\nvisual signals employed by the navy.\r\n\r\nThe improvements made in weapons have had a further influence on the\r\ntransformation of the infantry. Even a small force of infantry can with\r\nits magazine fire inflict annihilating losses in a very short time on\r\nclosed bodies offering favorable targets, especially when this fire is\r\ndelivered from a flanking position. This requires, on the one hand,\r\nthat greater attention be paid during combat to local reconnaissance,\r\nwhich can be but imperfectly made by mounted officers with the troops,\r\nand, on the other hand, it necessitates the employment of smaller\r\nindependent detachments for our own security and for harassing the\r\nenemy. Intimately connected herewith is the introduction of machine\r\nguns, possessing great mobility, which enables them to take advantage\r\nof rapidly passing moments for pouring a heavy fire on the enemy and\r\nalso for reinforcing the independent cavalry in advance of the army.\r\n\r\nIn England it was decided to form mounted infantry charged with the\r\nadditional duty of augmenting the fire of a cavalry division, and\r\nof furnishing the commander-in-chief with a reserve possessing the\r\nrequisite mobility to permit its being thrown to any threatened point\r\nof the long battle lines of today. But of what importance is the fire\r\nof a single battalion in the large armies of the present day? The\r\nprincipal drawback to the employment of mounted infantry is, however,\r\nthat, when mounted, it is defenseless against cavalry, and that, while\r\nin motion, it really needs a supporting force. In the Boer war the\r\nmounted infantry grew finally to a strength of 50,000 men. As it was\r\nnot confronted by cavalry, it made good during the execution of wide\r\nturning movements, which Lord Roberts employed with success for the\r\npurpose of striking the flank of the Boers, who always rapidly extended\r\ntheir lines. In spite of these good services, it could not be denied\r\nthat mounted infantry had many faults. The men knew nothing of the care\r\nof their mounts, as is evidenced by the large percentage of horses\r\nwhich became unserviceable. As mounted infantry units were improvised\r\nbodies, they lacked the requisite training in marching and tactical\r\nemployment. After the war had lasted for some time, the mounted\r\ninfantrymen, however, had completely forgotten their infantry character\r\nand deported themselves like cavalrymen, even if only as poor ones.\r\nThus, we find toward the close of the campaign numerous attacks made by\r\nmounted infantry on the British side, as, strange to relate, also on\r\nthat of the Boers.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment of creating mounted infantry, all those drawbacks\r\nwhich had been learned for centuries were exemplified. As an\r\nimprovisation, mounted infantry disturbs the cohesion of organizations;\r\nif permanently organized, it must become cavalry, just as the dragoons\r\nbecame cavalry: for mounted infantry is neither flesh, fish, nor fowl\r\nand cannot endure.\r\n\r\nThe British Drill Regulations (1904) for mounted infantry lay down the\r\nfollowing principles for its employment:\r\n\r\n  In the practical employment of mounted infantry, sight must not be\r\n  lost of the fact that this arm is drilled and trained as infantry. On\r\n  account of its greater mobility, it should be able to cover greater\r\n  distances, and, in addition, be capable of executing wider turning\r\n  movements than infantry. As a rule, mounted infantry is to be used in\r\n  the following cases:\r\n\r\n  (a) It is to perform the service of security in the immediate front\r\n  of infantry divisions in conjunction with cavalry and the horse\r\n  batteries assigned to the latter, in addition to augmenting the\r\n  fire of the cavalry. It is further to occupy, as expeditiously as\r\n  possible, tactically important positions. It is to find positions\r\n  from which it can bring fire, preferably flanking fire, to bear on\r\n  the flanks of hostile cavalry before the actual combat begins. It\r\n  is to improve every success gained and constitute a formed nucleus\r\n  in case of a retreat. Moreover, mounted infantry should enable the\r\n  cavalry divisions, far in advance of the army, to devote themselves\r\n  exclusively to the strategical reconnaissance with which they are\r\n  charged.\r\n\r\n  (b) In addition, the mounted infantry is to constitute a light\r\n  mobile reserve which the commander-in-chief can despatch at a\r\n  moment’s notice from one wing to the other for the purpose of lending\r\n  assistance, or for influencing the action at particular points\r\n  and for which other troops are not available on account of the\r\n  extraordinary extension of modern lines of battle.\r\n\r\n  (c) Finally, mounted infantry is to fill the role of a mobile\r\n  column in minor warfare or in expeditions in colonial wars, and in\r\n  performing this duty assume the functions of the absent cavalry in\r\n  the service of reconnaissance and patrolling.\r\n\r\n  The following is the organization and strength of mounted infantry\r\n  organizations:\r\n\r\n  In war every infantry battalion is to furnish one company of mounted\r\n  infantry, consisting of 5 officers, 138 men, and 144 horses; and\r\n  every brigade (4 battalions) one battalion of four companies. To each\r\n  battalion of mounted infantry is assigned: one machine gun platoon,\r\n  consisting of two guns and two ammunition carts (2 officers, 40\r\n  men, and 54 horses). Hence the aggregate strength of a battalion of\r\n  mounted infantry is: 28 officers, 630 men, and 676 horses.\r\n\r\nThe creation of mounted infantry is only proper where climatic\r\nconditions make long marches by European troops impossible, or in\r\ncases where the arrival of a few soldiers at distant points will exert\r\na potent influence on the actions of an opponent. As shown by our\r\nexperience in Southwest Africa, the proper field for mounted infantry\r\nis colonial (guerrilla) warfare, especially when it is important to\r\nprevent the outbreak of threatened disorders and to let the country\r\nreturn quickly to a state of peace upon completion of the principal\r\nactions. On European theaters of war, space is lacking for the\r\nemployment of mounted infantry, and, moreover, there are not enough\r\nhorses. In organizing mounted infantry, an auxiliary arm, which can be\r\nof use only occasionally, has been created at the expense of infantry\r\nand cavalry. The infantry itself should endeavor to meet all demands\r\nfor local reconnaissance and communication, without weakening the\r\ncavalry for its principal duties, and without, in so doing, crippling\r\nits own fighting efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of reconnaissance, patrols or scouting detachments are\r\nused. Their usefulness in difficult country and in enterprises against\r\nthe enemy’s flank or rear cannot be denied. In minor operations, by\r\nadvancing on side roads, they can hamper the enemy’s reconnaissance,\r\nsecure the flanks of their own force, ascertain the probable extent\r\nof the prospective battlefield, and, finally, having gained a firm\r\nfoothold, they can become very annoying to the hostile artillery. In a\r\nlarge battle the necessary elbow room for such employment is lacking.\r\nTo form special organizations of picked men, as is done in Russia, is\r\nalways of doubtful value. An organization cannot dispense with its\r\nbest men in action; it needs them as group leaders and as substitutes\r\nfor disabled non-commissioned officers. While everything goes without\r\na hitch, the withdrawal of good men from an organization is of little\r\nimportance; the drawbacks to this procedure become apparent, however,\r\nwhen heavy losses deplete the ranks, when the line begins to waver,\r\nwhen, in the absence of officers, only the example of courageous men\r\nprevents the weak-kneed from running away. Our regulations properly\r\nappreciate the importance of psychological impressions during\r\ncritical combat situations; they state: “The man who feels his\r\ncourage and coolness going, in the excitement of battle, should look\r\ntoward his officers. Should they have fallen, he will find plenty of\r\nnon-commissioned officers and brave privates whose example will revive\r\nhis courage.” (Par. 268 German I. D. R.). If it becomes necessary to\r\ndespatch a stronger infantry force on a mission of minor importance, it\r\nwill usually be better to detail an entire company than to improvise\r\na detachment whose leader would know his men only imperfectly. From\r\nthe standpoint of training, scouting detachments have an entirely\r\ndifferent value. They give young infantry officers, who are tied to\r\na command, an opportunity to develop self-confidence, decision, and\r\ntactical judgment; to cope with hardships and difficulties on their\r\nown responsibility. In this manner characteristics may be developed in\r\nthe young officers which will be of benefit to them in a large battle.\r\nIt is obvious that scouts should be assigned bicycles to give them the\r\nmobility which infantry lacks.\r\n\r\nIf the roads are good, cyclists[28] will frequently be able to take\r\nthe place of cavalry in messenger service. In this case they remain\r\nwith their organizations and perform the same duties as the other\r\nsoldiers. The employment of cyclists is in accord with the principle\r\nthat in war every resource the country offers for warfare should be\r\nutilized. The advantage of the use of cyclists for messenger service\r\nand their value to the command generally is obvious; they are, in\r\naddition, adapted for reconnaissance work and for reinforcing the\r\ndivisional cavalry. Cyclists, however, do not lend themselves to the\r\nformation of separate organizations for battle purposes (each division\r\nhas 110 cyclists), for a large number of picked men would thereby be\r\nwithdrawn from the ranks of the troops engaged. An improvised cyclist\r\ndetachment would, in addition, accomplish very little, as it would\r\nlack the thorough peace training requisite for cohesive action as an\r\norganization. If the opinion is entertained that cyclist detachments\r\ncould furnish substantial aid to the cavalry[29] in advance of the\r\narmy, that they could be employed profitably in the supply districts\r\nand in minor operations, and, finally, if the available material in\r\nthe country is to be utilized, nothing remains but to proceed to\r\nthe creation of cyclist companies in time of peace. The material\r\nnecessary for repairs and for ammunition supply can only be entrusted\r\nto permanent organizations. The advantages of cyclists are their great\r\nmobility,[30] their prompt readiness for firing, and, above all else,\r\nthe noiselessness of their movements. Their weakness lies in their\r\ndependence upon a complicated machine, in the comparatively large road\r\nspace taken up by them on the march (100 cyclists in column of twos\r\ntake up about 250 to 300 m. road space), and in their dependence on the\r\nterrain. The last mentioned drawback can be remedied apparently only\r\nby the adoption of a folding wheel, but, since the cyclist’s equipment\r\ncannot be secured on the machine, it is better in difficult country to\r\npush the wheels or to leave them behind under guard when necessary.\r\n\r\n    [28] Pars. 78, 82, 86, 99, 101, 132, 151, 152, 194 and 200, GERMAN\r\n  F. S. R.\r\n\r\n    [29] By occupying positions so as to give the cavalry freedom of\r\n  action; by advancing ahead of the reconnoitering cavalry for the\r\n  purpose of re-establishing contact with the enemy, of forestalling\r\n  him in occupying important points, or of outflanking him: finally, by\r\n  coöperating with cavalry in cavalry combats, in covering a retreat,\r\n  in outpost duty, and during the execution of technical work.\r\n\r\n    [30] According to the _Italian Regulations of 1904_, the rate of\r\n  march of cyclists is as follows: slow rate 8 km., maneuvering rate,\r\n  10-12 km., road speed, 12-17 km., accelerated rate of march, up to 20\r\n  km. per hour. Cyclists can ride up to 80 km., without long rests. For\r\n  riding 90-100 km., from 5 to 6 hours are required.\r\n\r\n  In Italy, France, and England more has been done towards the\r\n  formation of cyclist detachments than elsewhere. In Italy each\r\n  _Bersaglieri_ Regiment has one company of cyclists, which is to be\r\n  employed in supporting a cavalry brigade. Cyclists have accomplished\r\n  a good deal in surmounting difficulties of the terrain. In England\r\n  the development of cyclist bodies is left mostly to the volunteers\r\n  and their exercises have demonstrated that such units are capable of\r\n  expanding in a brief space of time.\r\n\r\n  In France the cyclist movement is led by Major Gerard, who rendered\r\n  valuable service during a short maneuver of the cavalry division\r\n  (1905). Opinions are as yet divided as to the advisability of forming\r\n  cyclist battalions. Both Major Gerard and General Langlois are\r\n  advocates of their employment. General Langlois desires to oppose the\r\n  brutal German battle tactics with rapid maneuvers of mobile reserves\r\n  which he would form of cyclist battalions, artillery, and cavalry.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Cyclist Regulations dated September 10th, 1904, the\r\ncyclist company is to be looked upon as infantry, which is capable of\r\nmoving at great speed, but is tied to the network of roads. The cyclist\r\ncompanies are principally intended for defensive action, holding\r\nan important point until the arrival of infantry. They are also to\r\nserve as support for cavalry and artillery, but are not adapted for\r\nreconnaissance work. Since it is difficult for them to secure their\r\nflanks on the march, they are to be used mainly in combination with\r\nother arms.\r\n\r\nIn winter campaigns, when wheel and horse cannot be used, recourse is\r\nhad to the Canadian snowshoe (a web shoe) or to the Norwegian snowshoe\r\nor ski (skee). In France, Italy, Austria,[31] Norway, Sweden, and\r\nSwitzerland marching on snowshoes is assiduously practiced, while in\r\nGermany the troops have so far done little in this line. The ski is,\r\nhowever, coming more and more into vogue among the rural population of\r\nthe German mountains.\r\n\r\n    [31] One of the most remarkable snowshoe marches ever recorded is\r\n  without doubt that made by the ski detachment of the 4th Regiment\r\n  of Tirolese Kaiser-Jägers (Austria) stationed in Salzburg. In\r\n  June, 1905, this detachment, consisting of 4 officers, 15 men and\r\n  4 guides, all with field equipment, marched around the base of the\r\n  “Grosz Glockner,” via Mittersil, Felber-Tauern (elev. 2,500 m.),\r\n  Windisch-Matrey, Lienz, Dolsack, Hochtor (elev. 2,570 m.), into the\r\n  Fuscher valley, despite violent cyclonic snow storms, a journey\r\n  which, even in mid-summer, can only be undertaken by experienced\r\n  tourists. In several of these detachments experiments were made with\r\n  white covers for uniform and equipment, which enabled individual men\r\n  and patrols to approach unseen to within 200 to 300 m. of an opponent.\r\n\r\nDeep snow is an effective obstacle for troops not equipped with\r\nsnowshoes. This is not entirely due to the fact that the march is\r\nretarded, but to the unusual difficulties attending the service of\r\nsecurity. Covering bodies are stalled. Besides, the difficulties of\r\nmaintaining communication with neighboring detachments are increased\r\nwhen valleys or abrupt declivities intervene between the forces. The\r\nonly remedy in such cases is to employ the snowshoe, upon which one\r\ncan move rapidly without regard to roads, and up or down hill without\r\ndifficulty. Patrols can be despatched to adequate distances from the\r\nmarching body on skis alone. Ski-runners can perform the same duty\r\nwhich cavalry performs on the plain; for instance, they can occupy\r\npoints in advance which are of importance to us, dispute crossings\r\nwith the enemy, and hold him at bay. Ski detachments alone are able\r\nto reconnoiter the condition of roads and test the carrying power of\r\nsnow in advance of a command, and they alone can furnish the connecting\r\nlinks in an extended outpost position, because they alone are able to\r\nmove off the roads. During halts they furnish guards; in action they\r\neasily turn the enemy’s flanks, reconnoiter his weak points as well as\r\nthe position of his reserves; and after the fight they maintain contact\r\nwith him as patrols. They can hasten forward in advance of a command\r\nand prepare cantonments and bivouacs, and attend to the cooking.\r\n\r\nThe great depth of a detachment of ski-runners is a disadvantage. Each\r\nski-runner takes up 2.20 m., and in addition a distance of 1 m. must\r\nbe left between men. Besides, as the men are not all equally skilled\r\nin using skis, the road space taken up by a detachment of runners is\r\nincreased considerably. This necessitates the employment of small\r\ndetachments not exceeding 100 men. The proper sphere of ski-runners is\r\npatrol duty. In winter campaigns ski-runners are a necessary substitute\r\nfor cavalry. In Scandinavia reconnaissance detachments are composed\r\nof ski-runners and cavalry, the horses pulling the runners. This\r\npermits a very rapid movement over snow-covered ground and may also be\r\nemployed where the use of the much slower sled is impracticable owing\r\nto the nature of the terrain. Much practice is undoubtedly necessary\r\nto acquire proficiency in this sport[32], for it surely cannot be\r\neasy to preserve an upright position on skis behind a galloping horse,\r\nwhile at the same time overcoming all the difficulties of the ground.\r\nWhen troopers cannot continue to perform reconnaissance work, they\r\nare replaced by snowshoe or ski-runners. The snowshoe performances in\r\nFrance, since the establishment by War Department order of a training\r\nschool in Briançon, are worthy of note. According to the experiences\r\ngained at that institution, a period of four weeks is ample for\r\ntraining men for extended mountain marches. On January 18th, 1904, a\r\nbody of men on snowshoes covered a distance of 80 km., including a\r\nclimb of 1,700 m., in 20 hours (4 hours’ rest included).\r\n\r\n    [32] During the Norse winter sports of 1905, the winner covered a\r\n  distance of 67 km. in 2³⁄₄ hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE TACTICAL UNIT.\r\n\r\nBy the term tactical unit is meant the smallest element of a body of\r\ntroops capable of sustaining an action independently, of performing\r\na simple combat task, and the elements of which (man and horse) are\r\npersonally known to the leader. Moreover, the tactical unit should be\r\nsmall enough to allow of its being controlled by the voice of a single\r\nleader. This requirement limits the battle front of the tactical unit\r\nto about 100 m., which corresponds approximately to the front of a\r\ntroop[33] (_Eskadron_) in line, or to that of a battery of six pieces.\r\nThe frontage of the tactical unit of cavalry might with advantage be\r\ndecreased, while that of artillery, on account of its stability in\r\naction, might be extended, were it not for the fact that the increase\r\nin the quantity of matériel and in the number of horses involved in\r\nsuch extension would make the supervision of the unit too difficult\r\nfor a single person. In nearly all large armies the strength of a\r\ntroop (_Eskadron_) of cavalry and of a field battery is approximately\r\n150 horses.[34] This corresponds approximately to what the farmer\r\nof northern Germany considers suitable to keep together in one\r\nestablishment. If the estate is larger, requiring more than 150 men and\r\nhorses, subsidiary farms[35] are established.\r\n\r\n    [33] _Eskadron_ has been rendered by “troop” in this work. The\r\n  German _Eskadron_ consists of 4-5 officers, 138-144 men, and 135-139\r\n  horses. It is the smallest administrative unit of the German cavalry\r\n  and is divided into four Züge (platoons). _Translator._\r\n\r\n    [34] GENERAL MARMONT, in his _Esprit des Institutions Militaires_,\r\n  p. 41, states that experience has shown that the most suitable\r\n  strength for a troop is 48 files, divided into four platoons; but, he\r\n  recommends that platoons should consist of 16-18 files in order to\r\n  maintain this strength throughout a campaign.\r\n\r\n    [35] _Vorwerke._\r\n\r\nWhile column tactics were in vogue, the above mentioned requirements of\r\na tactical unit were completely fulfilled by the battalion, but this is\r\nno longer the case. It is quite impossible for one voice to control the\r\nmovements of a battalion in action; this is scarcely possible in case\r\nof a company. On the other hand, a company is too weak to carry out an\r\nindependent mission in action. Nothing less than a battalion possesses\r\nthe requisite fighting power, strength, and capacity for subdivision,\r\nto sustain an action independently, to solve minor problems of combat,\r\nand to remain a body full of fighting efficiency even after sustaining\r\nserious losses such as are unavoidable in every modern infantry action.\r\n\r\nTo attempt a further definition of the term “tactical unit” would be of\r\nlittle value. General von Scherff in a logical manner[36] constructs\r\na “troop unit”[37] from “fighting groups”[38] (squad of infantry or\r\ncavalry, or one gun), several of which form a “fighting unit”[39]\r\n(company, troop or battery), “possessing the requisite power to carry\r\nout a specific task,” and placed under the command of a responsible\r\nleader. “The definition of a fighting unit includes, on principle,\r\nits indivisibility in action. Dispersion is a crime, division at\r\nleast an evil.” The “combat unit”[40] consists of a number of fighting\r\nunits. “The commander of the combat unit (infantry battalion, cavalry\r\nregiment, or artillery battalion) should be able to lead it as a\r\ncompact entity, and should have the power of employing its component\r\nparts independently for combined action against some point.” General\r\nvon Scherff has found imitators in Austria, where the term body of\r\ntroops (_Truppenkörper_) is applied to an organization having the\r\nnecessary means for feeding, clothing, and equipping the men, and which\r\nis composed of a number of “basic units.”[41] Such “basic units” as\r\ncan be supervised, handled, and controlled directly by one leader, who\r\nknows the individual men thereof and their characteristics, are the\r\ntroop (_Eskadron_), battery, and company. Von Boguslawski[42] applies\r\nthe term “fighting unit” to organizations from the company (troop) to\r\nthe brigade, which act in accordance with the tactics of their arm,\r\nsupported by the other arms, in the sphere assigned to them by orders\r\nor by circumstances. Divisions, which, by the coöperation of the three\r\narms, are capable of independent employment on the march and in action,\r\nhe calls “combat units.” According to Boguslawski, army corps are\r\n“battle units,”[43] with which the commander reckons in battle, and\r\nwhich are strong enough to meet an energetic attack or to execute one\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n    [36] _Von der Kriegführung_, p. 49.\r\n\r\n    [37] _Truppeneinheit._\r\n\r\n    [38] _Kampfgruppen._\r\n\r\n    [39] _Kampfeinheit._\r\n\r\n    [40] _Gefechtseinheit._\r\n\r\n    [41] _Schlachteneinheiten._\r\n\r\n    [42] _Entwickelung der Taktik_, III, p. 125.\r\n\r\n    [43] _Grundeinheiten._\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe basic unit of infantry is the company, from 200 to 250 men strong\r\nin the larger armies. It seems hardly practicable to exceed a strength\r\nof 150 men, as this is about the greatest number in which a relation\r\nbased upon personal influence of the leader on his subordinates can\r\nstill be obtained. In armies in which companies are composed of more\r\nthan 200 men, the numbers in excess of this figure may be regarded as a\r\nmargin of safety, intended to maintain the company at a strength of 200\r\nrifles after the first casualties of a campaign, produced by marching,\r\ndetached service and battle losses. In view of the losses, which\r\nfrequently increase with extraordinary rapidity in modern battles, it\r\nappears undesirable to fix a lower figure than that above mentioned,\r\nas the companies would otherwise lose their independence and could no\r\nlonger be considered basic units.\r\n\r\n  ===========+=========+===================================++\r\n             |         |

tactical purposes in some regiments of the Guard\r\n  Corps. The administration of the consolidated companies had to\r\n  remain distinct on account of the preparation of casualty lists,\r\n  recommendations for promotion and decorations. On the day of the\r\n  battle of =Orleans=, the strength of the German battalions varied\r\n  from 459 men in the 1st Bavarian Army Corps to 747 men in the 40th\r\n  Infantry Brigade. During the pursuit after the battle of =Le Mans=,\r\n  the strength of the 56th Füsilier-Battalion was even reduced to 280\r\n  men.\r\n\r\nThe actual training of troops must be completed in the company. Combat\r\nby an independent company is the exception; combat by battalion the\r\nrule. By the consolidation of four companies into one unit, the\r\nbattalion, consisting of 800-1,000 rifles, is formed. The French\r\nChasseur battalions are the only ones that consist of six companies,\r\nbecause their proposed independent employment, for instance, in\r\nmountain warfare, makes it more often necessary to detach small units\r\nthan is the case in operations on more favorable terrain.\r\n\r\n  As, in the course of time, the independence of companies in action\r\n  developed, and as the combat of the battalion as an entity was\r\n  transformed into combined action of the four companies, the strength\r\n  of the company increased from 120 to 250 rifles while the number of\r\n  companies in a battalion diminished. The battalion of Frederick the\r\n  Great was divided for administrative purposes into five companies\r\n  and for tactical purposes into eight _pelotons_. The battalion of\r\n  the first empire consisted of six _Füsilier_ and two _Voltigeur_\r\n  companies, and the Austrian battalion, until the reorganization after\r\n  1866, consisted of six companies of which each two formed a division.\r\n  Until 1866 the six company battalion predominated in the infantry of\r\n  all European armies (France, Italy, Austria, and the minor German\r\n  states), but early in the seventies most of the states adopted the\r\n  four company battalion, Russia being the last to do this (four line\r\n  and one sharpshooter company). In the regulations of 1812, Prussia\r\n  had adopted the four company battalion. The independent employment\r\n  of the four united sharpshooter platoons of a battalion was the\r\n  exception even during the campaign of 1866. At present only the\r\n  British battalion consists of eight companies, which cannot, however,\r\n  be said to possess a capacity for independent action on account of\r\n  their small size.\r\n\r\nIn the four-company organization the battalion possesses an asset\r\nwhich enables it to adapt itself easily to any combat situation. The\r\nbattalion organization is the outgrowth of practical necessity; the\r\nregimental commander cannot handle 12-16 companies without difficulty,\r\nand an intermediate unit, the battalion, is necessary. The battalion\r\nis the practical, and the regiment, consisting of 3 or 4 battalions,\r\nthe ideal unit. Regiments consisting of two battalions do not possess\r\nthe same advantages, as the regimental staff becomes superfluous during\r\neach necessary division of the regiment. Two battalion regiments do\r\nindeed facilitate command; they are, however, more expensive in time\r\nof peace and are of advantage in action only when formed into brigades\r\nof six battalions each, in which case the commander has a compactly\r\norganized reserve available.\r\n\r\n“The regiment, by reason of its history, the uniformity of its\r\ntraining, the _esprit de corps_ of its officers, and its division into\r\nthree battalions--thereby facilitating subdivision--is pre-eminently\r\nfitted for carrying out definite combat tasks.” (Par. 470 German I. D.\r\nR.). A glance at the map of the battle of Vionville (5B of the German\r\nGeneral Staff work on the Franco-German war) shows that regiments,\r\nwhenever they entered the field intact, fought as unbroken units\r\nthroughout the battle, whereas brigade organizations were frequently\r\nbroken up.\r\n\r\nThis breaking up of brigades is practically induced by the two regiment\r\nbrigade organization. (Par. 471 German I. D. R.). When once the brigade\r\ncommander has assigned sections or points of attack to his regiments,\r\nthere remains very little for him to do. He can form a reserve only\r\nby taking two battalions from one regiment, or one battalion from\r\neach. The brigade is, however, not like the regiment, an entity of\r\nbodies of troops, but a unit assembled for tactical purposes, which\r\nmay, without regard to the whole, be increased or diminished by one or\r\nmore battalions in case of necessity. On the march and in action the\r\nbrigade organization as a subdivision of the division cannot always be\r\nmaintained; groups are frequently formed in which the normal units\r\nmust be broken up. In large battles the brigade is the largest force\r\nwhich may yet be employed as an intact unit, although the employment of\r\ninfantry by regiments will continue to be the rule. Brigade commanders\r\nare necessary for decreasing units of command and desirable for\r\nrelieving the division commanders of a part of their work. In time of\r\npeace brigade commanders are useful for directing recruitment and,\r\nmoreover, as connecting links between regiments and the division.\r\nThe unmistakable advantages of the three-battalion organization have\r\ninduced the United States to form its brigades of three regiments, each\r\nof three battalions (of 400 men each). An English division consists of\r\nthree brigades of four battalions each.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. INTRENCHING TOOL EQUIPMENT.[45]\r\n\r\n    [45] In the Russo-Japanese war the Russian companies were equipped\r\n  with 80 small spades and 20 hand axes; the Japanese companies with 68\r\n  small spades, 17 mattocks, 8 hatchets, and 30 wire cutters.\r\n\r\nEarth as a covering material and, incidental thereto, the adoption\r\nof the small spade after the Russo-Turkish war, have increased in\r\nimportance owing to the greater penetrating power of the modern\r\ninfantry bullets. The disadvantages of the spade lie in the danger of\r\nits being misused and in the consequent impairment of offensive spirit.\r\nThere is, moreover, danger that the fire effect will be impaired and\r\nsubordinated to considerations of cover. The spade should therefore not\r\nbe employed on every occasion, but only when the tactical purpose in\r\nview requires it.\r\n\r\nWhat the weight of the portable intrenching equipment of the Japanese,\r\nRussian, and British infantry will be, is still undecided, but\r\nexperiments are being made with a uniform tool. When we consider, that\r\nfor the purpose of intrenching, one man requires a space of 1.20 m.,\r\nand for handling his rifle a space of 0.8 m., and that when intrenching\r\nunder fire all the men cannot work, it is obvious that it would be\r\nimpracticable to equip each man with an intrenching tool. According\r\nto all experience, it is sufficient to furnish every other man with\r\nspade or pick. In addition to this, however, a company requires a large\r\nnumber of wire cutters. Only the French infantry is equipped with\r\nexplosives, every regiment having 108 cartridges.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the intrenching tool equipment available in\r\neach battalion:\r\n\r\n  +=========+================================+=================+=======\r\n            |        FOR EARTH WORK.         | FOR TIMBER WORK.|\r\n  ----------+-----------------+--------------+---------+-------+-------\r\n            |      Small      |    Large     |  Small  | Large |\r\n            |   Intrenching   | Intrenching  |    Intrenching  |\r\n            |     Tools.      |   Tools.     |       Tools.    |\r\n  ----------+-------+---------+-------+------+---------+-------+------\r\n            |Spades.|Mattocks.|Spades.|Picks.|Hatchets.| Axes. |Total.\r\n  ----------+-------+---------+-------+------+---------+-------+------\r\n  Germany   |  400  |   40    |  20   |  10  |    35   |  8    |  513\r\n  Austria   |  400  |   64    |   8   |  16  |   ...   |  8[46]|  ...\r\n  Italy[47] |   32  |    8    |  36   |  18  |   ...   | 62    |  ...\r\n  France[48]|  448  |  128    | ...   | ...  |   ...   |...    |  ...\r\n  ----------+-------+---------+-------+------+---------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n    [46] Each company has 4 pioneers, which carry intrenching and\r\n  carpenter tools in addition to their rifles. These men are formed\r\n  into a pioneer platoon of 64 men in each regiment.\r\n\r\n    [47] The adoption of portable intrenching tools, 50 spades and\r\n  12-15 mattocks per company, is contemplated.\r\n\r\n    [48] The following demolition tools are available in each\r\n  battalion: 64 picks, 64 fascine knives, and 16 wire cutters. Sappeur\r\n  sections carry in addition a mattock or a pick apiece, and each\r\n  ammunition carrier also carries a pick, a fascine knife, or a saw.\r\n  The large intrenching tools are apparently being changed at the\r\n  present moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE LOAD OF THE INFANTRYMAN.\r\n\r\nThe load carried by the infantryman should not exceed one-third of\r\nthe man’s weight (84 kg.), or not more than 28 kg. According to the\r\n“Regulations for the Employment of Infantry Equipment, M/95,” the load\r\nof a soldier whose height is 1.67 m. (the equipment consisting of new\r\nexperimental pieces) is about 27 kg., distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Clothing                            5.397 kg.\r\n  Equipment[49]                       3,964  „\r\n  Baggage[50]                         5.600  „\r\n  Arms and ammunition                 8.507  „\r\n  Rations (including breakfast).      3.238  „\r\n                                     ----------\r\n    Total                            26.706 kg.\r\n\r\nTo this must be added intrenching tools:\r\n\r\n  Small spade and scabbard   0.89 kg.\r\n  Hatchet                    1.08  „\r\n  Mattock                    1.48  „\r\n  Load with spade          27.596  „\r\n\r\n    [49] Tent equipment 1.620 kg.\r\n\r\n    [50] Iron ration, 2.388 kg.

THE FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE ISSUE OF ORDERS.\r\n\r\nTroops are set in motion by words of command, and, when these do not\r\nsuffice, by orders. (Orders give information of the situation and the\r\nintentions of the commander, and assign tasks, but leave the recipient\r\nfree to choose the method of carrying them out). When commands are\r\ngiven from a distance, time and energy may be saved by employing the\r\ntelephone and visual signals. To these may be added shouts, signs, and\r\nthe following signals: _To advance_, the leader raises the arm; to\r\nindicate that the command is _to follow him_, he extends his raised arm\r\nin the direction of march; _to halt_, he lowers the arm; _to deploy_,\r\nboth arms are raised laterally to the height of the shoulders, and if\r\nnecessary the direction the skirmish line is to take is subsequently\r\nindicated with one extended arm; _to assemble_ his men, the leader\r\ndescribes a circle above his head with one arm. These signals may also\r\nbe made with the sabre or rifle. Additional signals should be agreed\r\nupon beforehand in each separate case. If a signal is made to a body of\r\ntroops in close order, it is meant, in the first place, for its leader.\r\n(Par. 11 German I. D. R.). Other signals, such as those indicating a\r\nchange of direction of march, or a change in the battle formation, must\r\nbe specially agreed upon beforehand. Trumpet signals are only used by\r\ntroops in garrison at drills, and in barracks or billets as service\r\ncalls. To prevent troops from misunderstanding signals or from obeying\r\nthose not intended for them, all trumpet calls in battle, except\r\n“charge,” “fix bayonet,” and “attention,” are forbidden.\r\n\r\n  During the engagement of =Trautenau= (27th June, 1866), the trumpet\r\n  signal “assemble,” given at another point, caused four Prussian\r\n  battalions to withdraw.[55] See also the effect of the signal\r\n  “assemble” after the taking of =Problus=.[56] Notice the effect of\r\n  the signal “form square” during the assault on the =Forest of Bor=\r\n  (=Königgrätz=).[57]\r\n\r\n    [55] KÜHNE, _Kritische Wanderungen_, 3, 2nd Edition, pp. 55 and 85.\r\n\r\n    [56] _Geschichte des Infanterie-Regiments Nr. 16_, p. 230.\r\n\r\n    [57] _Geschichte des Infanterie-Regiments Nr. 57_, p. 47. HÖNIG,\r\n  _Untersuchungen über die Taktik der Zukunft_, 4th Edition, p. 61.\r\n\r\n  On the morning of June 26th, 1866 (day of rest), reveille sounded\r\n  by a trumpeter was mistaken for an alarm signal. The 7th Infantry\r\n  Division assembled and the signal was repeated in two other army\r\n  corps. Two days previous another useless alarm had occurred because a\r\n  trumpeter, surprised by a number of Radetzky Hussars, had blown the\r\n  alarm signal.[58]\r\n\r\n    [58] _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 66_, pp. 48/49.\r\n\r\n  The village of =Diletz= (action at =Gitschin=, 1866) was to be\r\n  evacuated at the sounding of the signal (Saxon) “First Brigade\r\n  withdraw.” The signal was, however, understood and carried out\r\n  by only three battalions; two battalions, which were at the time\r\n  engaged, did not hear it at all and maintained their position until\r\n  they were taken in reverse by hostile fire and forced to withdraw.[59]\r\n\r\n    [59] _Anteil des Königlich-Sächsischen Armeekorps_, p. 130.\r\n\r\n  In the crisis of the fight of the Füsilier Battalion of the 48th\r\n  Infantry and the 1st Battalion of the 52nd at =Vionville=, the signal\r\n  “assemble” was sounded and repeated by other trumpeters, further\r\n  mischief being averted by the energetic efforts of the officers who\r\n  prevented trumpeters from blowing the call and ordered them to blow\r\n  “commence firing” instead.[60]\r\n\r\n    [60] _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 52_, p. 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

COMPARISON BETWEEN LINE AND COLUMN.\r\n\r\nThe object of assembly formations is to unite troops, usually prior\r\nto a movement, in a restricted space permitting an easy survey of the\r\nentire body. Assembly formations serve also the purpose of placing\r\ntroops in readiness before starting on a march, before beginning an\r\naction, and for moving them on the battlefield when out of reach of\r\nhostile fire (columns). Route formations should permit an orderly,\r\ncomfortable march of the troops, as much of the available width of road\r\nbeing used as possible, a space being left for orderlies and mounted\r\nmessengers, and for troops which are drawn forward. In order to permit\r\na prompt deployment of troops for action, it is necessary to reduce\r\ntheir depth. Columns only are suitable for moving troops. The situation\r\nexisting at the moment will determine to what extent allowances may\r\nbe made for the comfort of the troops, or how far considerations of\r\ncomfort should be ignored in view of readiness for action, and to what\r\nextent the depth of the columns should be decreased.\r\n\r\nThe formations for moving troops (to be employed in marching across\r\ncountry and to be used on the battlefield) should be such as to\r\ncause the least discomfort to the troops, should make it possible to\r\navoid obstacles, to utilize cover, facilitate changes of front and\r\ndirection of march, and permit a prompt deployment in any direction.\r\nThese formations are columns unless the hostile fire effect makes a\r\ndeployment into line necessary.\r\n\r\nBattle formations should be such as to permit the employment of all\r\nweapons (rifles, lances, sabres, and guns). This requirement is not\r\nsatisfied by columns, but only by the line. Modern fire effect excludes\r\nevery employment of close order formations under effective hostile fire\r\nand compels the most extensive deployment.\r\n\r\nWhether line or column is the preferable battle formation is a question\r\nbelonging to a bygone age. The battles of the British in Spain and at\r\nWaterloo, the engagement at Groszbeeren, and the attack of the six\r\nbattalions of Borke’s Brigade (the 8th) at the Katzbach,[61] amply\r\ndemonstrate that the defeat of the Prussians at Jena was not due to\r\nthe employment of linear battle formations alone. In a fight with an\r\nequal opponent, formed in columns, well trained and disciplined troops,\r\nformed in line that allows of the use of all the rifles and is suitable\r\nfor shock action as well, have always carried off the victory.[62]\r\nOn the other hand, in the battles of the Empire we find columns\r\nformed, which of necessity excluded a large part of the men from\r\nparticipation in the action, but which were designed to break through\r\nthe hostile battle line by sheer momentum. At Wagram, Macdonald’s Corps\r\nwas formed with eight deployed battalions in rear of each other in a\r\nsingle column, supported on the flanks by seven and eight battalions\r\nrespectively, also in column. At Austerlitz and Waterloo we find attack\r\nformations in which from eight to twelve battalions of a division were\r\ndeployed one in rear of the other at distances of twenty paces. Column\r\nand line must be examined with reference to their mobility, their\r\nvulnerability and their fire and shock power.\r\n\r\n    [61] FRIEDERICH, _Herbstfeldzug, 1813_, I, p. 305.\r\n\r\n    [62] RENARD, _Considérations sur la tactique de l’infanterie en\r\n  Europe_, Paris, 1857.\r\n\r\n    RÜSTOW, _Geschichte der Infanterie_, II, p. 316.\r\n\r\nThe column possesses greater mobility and is better adapted than\r\nthe line for executing changes of front and for taking advantage of\r\nthe cover afforded by the ground. In a column steadiness and shock\r\npower (produced by the crowding forward of the ranks in rear) and the\r\ninfluence exerted by the officers, is greater than in a line.\r\n\r\nThe line is more dependent on the terrain in its movements. The\r\ncharacteristics of the line are great frontal fire power, weakness of\r\nthe flanks, difficulty of quickly changing front, and the ever present\r\ndanger of being pierced. The line has been called the formation of the\r\nbold, the column that of the weak.\r\n\r\n  The column[63] was proposed as a battle formation in France as early\r\n  as 1774 by Mesnil Durand, but did not find practical application\r\n  until the wars of the Revolution. In those wars columns were used\r\n  because the raw levies lacked the training necessary for making\r\n  movements in line. Whenever a line formation was used, battalions,\r\n  owing to the scarcity of efficient officers, resolved themselves\r\n  into disorderly skirmish lines which were exceedingly difficult to\r\n  control. The adoption of the column was, therefore, the result of\r\n  practical experience, but as a formation it could be justified on\r\n  the battlefield only so long as it remained capable of development\r\n  for the purpose of firing. The endeavor to combine the advantages\r\n  of column and line by a combination of both formations led to the\r\n  placing of columns in rear of the wings of the battalions deployed in\r\n  line. This formation was employed for the first time in the attack\r\n  made by a demi-brigade during the battle on the =Tagliamento= (1797),\r\n  and subsequently it was used at =Marengo= (attack made by Desaix’s\r\n  Division).\r\n\r\n    [63] The development of the French column tactics is splendidly\r\n  portrayed by KUHL in his work _Bonapartes erster Feldzug, 1796_, p.\r\n  46, et seq.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  During the first decade of the 19th Century the French leaders had\r\n  a marked _penchant_ for this formation, until it sank more and more\r\n  into insignificance in face of the deep column. (Ney at =Waterloo=,\r\n  and Macdonald at =Wagram=). Formations suggesting the above are found\r\n  even in the Prussian regulations of 1876. (Posting of sharpshooter\r\n  platoons of the companies at first in rear of the wings of the\r\n  deployed battalion, and later in rear of the outer flank platoons of\r\n  the companies).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn account of the increased penetrating power of infantry projectiles,\r\nespecially at short ranges, a column will suffer greater losses than a\r\nline; at longer ranges the curvature of the trajectory causes bullets\r\nwhich pass over the first echelon to strike the second or third. On\r\nground falling with respect to the line of sight, lines, and on ground\r\nrising with respect to the line of sight, columns are exposed to\r\ngreater losses when they come within the beaten zone.[64]\r\n\r\n    [64] At 1000 m., the projectile of rifle model ’98 falls 5 cm. for\r\n  each meter of the range, and at 1200 m. it falls 6 cm. per meter of\r\n  the range, so that the second and third platoons of a company in\r\n  column of platoons (7.2 m. distance between platoons) would offer a\r\n  target having a vulnerable surface 35 cm. high (¹⁄₅ the height of a\r\n  man), at 1000 m., 42 cm. high (¹⁄₄ the height of a man) at 1200 m.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) Formation of the Company.\r\n\r\n(Par. 83 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIn the company the files are placed in two ranks according to height\r\nfrom right to left. Each four files form a squad or group, and the\r\nentire company is divided into three platoons (_Züge_). When a platoon\r\nconsists of more than three squads it is divided into two sections\r\n(_Halbzüge_).\r\n\r\nIn the normal formation of the company, the three platoons, each in\r\ntwo ranks,[65] are posted on a line in numerical order from right\r\nto left. This formation facilitates firing and in garrison meets\r\nthe requirements of barrack life, each two squads forming a section\r\n(_Korporalschaft_) under a non-commissioned officer. During the\r\ncampaign of 1866 Prince Frederick Charles gave permission to arrange\r\ncompanies so that friends and relatives could serve together in the\r\nsame squad or section. A company formed in this fashion would, of\r\ncourse, not look so well on parade as one formed regularly, the men\r\naccording to height from right to left flank, but it would without\r\ndoubt give a better account of itself in action. For details of the\r\nformation of a company and division into fractions see pars. 82-85,\r\nGerman I. D. R. The squad leaders and the two range finders in each\r\nplatoon are posted as file closers at facing distance in rear of the\r\nrear rank of the company.\r\n\r\n    [65] The number of ranks is intimately related to the rate of\r\n  fire of the infantry weapon. During the days of slow loading, the\r\n  necessity of keeping at least a part of the rifles at all times ready\r\n  for firing led the Imperialists in the Thirty Years’ war (loading\r\n  was executed by 90 motions) to form their musketeers into sixteen\r\n  ranks, while Gustavus Adolphus was able to form his infantry into\r\n  six ranks owing to the greater loading facility of their rifles.\r\n  In the Seven Years’ war the Prussian infantry was formed in three,\r\n  that of the Austrians in four ranks, the fourth rank serving as a\r\n  reserve. The first rank fired kneeling. The British infantry was the\r\n  first to adopt the two rank formation for fire action, forming into\r\n  four ranks for shock action and frequently for warding off cavalry\r\n  attacks. Emperor Napoleon considered a third rank useless for fire\r\n  and shock action and initiated the double rank formation on the eve\r\n  of the battle of Leipzig. In 1888 the Prussian infantry--the last to\r\n  do so--gave up the three rank formation which had long since lost its\r\n  importance in battle and which was retained side by side with the\r\n  double rank formation for purposes of parade only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe _non-commissioned officers_ are posted in the front rank, on the\r\nflanks and in the center of the platoons in Russia, Austria, and\r\nSwitzerland. In Germany and Italy they are all posted in rear of the\r\nline as file closers, and it is their duty to supervise the men. In\r\nFrance a part of the non-commissioned officers are posted in the front\r\nrank, the remainder as file closers. A German company of 200 men has\r\na front of 100 paces, or 80 m. The infantryman with field equipment\r\noccupies a space about 75 cm. square.\r\n\r\n  The German Infantry Drill Regulations define interval (_intervalle_)\r\n  as the space between two elements on the same line, and distance as\r\n  the space between two elements in the direction of depth. An interval\r\n  is measured from the left flank of the element on the right to the\r\n  right flank of the element on the left (or vice versa); and distance\r\n  in the company and in the battalion is measured from the rear of the\r\n  element in front to the head of the element in rear (or vice versa).\r\n  If the distance between two elements is equal to their front, the\r\n  column is called an “open column”, otherwise it is called a “close\r\n  column.”\r\n\r\nFRONT AND FACING DISTANCE.\r\n\r\n  ===========+=========================+================================\r\n             |        FRONT.           |       FACING DISTANCE.\r\n             |      (Per man.)         |  (Distance between ranks.)\r\n  -----------+-------------------------+--------------------------------\r\n  Germany    |About 0.80 m.

They are\r\nplaced side by side and constitute the company in line. In Germany\r\nand Russia the company is at each formation divided into platoons of\r\napproximately equal strength. In the armies of Austria, France, and\r\nItaly, it is contended that the soldier has nothing further to learn\r\nwhen once he is taken up for duty in the company. All movements are\r\nexecuted, after preparatory commands given by the company commanders,\r\nby commands of execution or signals given by platoon commanders. The\r\nexecution of movements is retarded by this procedure and the movement\r\nitself becomes clumsy. It would also seem that the multiplicity of\r\ncommands in the simple, oft-repeated movements, is superfluous,\r\nespecially in the weak platoons at peace strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: France.]\r\n\r\n  Column of platoons from line (par. 121 German I. D. R.: “Form column\r\n  of platoons”) is formed in Austria as follows (Austrian I. D. R. par.\r\n  360): At the preparatory command, “Column,” given by the company\r\n  commander, the leaders of the 1st, 3rd, and 4th platoons command\r\n  at once, as in forming column of fours to the front, “Fours right\r\n  (left), column right (left).” At the command “march,” the platoons\r\n  step off, each turning in column to the rear, and are conducted to\r\n  their new positions, halted, and dressed to the right (left).\r\n\r\nThe companies of all powers, those of Germany, Japan, and Belgium\r\nexcepted, are divided into four platoons; each two platoons may in\r\naddition be combined into a half-company. The German, Japanese, and\r\nBelgian companies are divided into three platoons. “The platoon is not\r\nan independent subdivision by reason of the mere fact that it consists\r\nof a certain number of men, but because the term platoon denotes a\r\nforce led by a man of superior intelligence. The officer commanding\r\nthe platoon makes it what it should be. The strength of the platoon is\r\ntherefore solely dependent upon the number of officers available.” (VON\r\nSCHERFF).\r\n\r\nThe obvious advantage of the three-platoon organization of the company\r\nis that fewer platoon commanders are required, which fact is well\r\nworthy of attention in the mobilization of units of both Line and\r\nReserve, especially in view of the extraordinarily heavy casualties\r\namong the troop leaders in the course of a campaign.[66]\r\n\r\n    [66] See also _Taktik_, V, pp. 81, 88.\r\n\r\n  It is only necessary to recall the situation of the Guard Corps and\r\n  of the IIIrd Army Corps after the battles around =Metz=, and the\r\n  condition of the German troops during the advance to =Le Mans=. On\r\n  January 7th, 1871, there were 36 officers with the 57th Infantry, of\r\n  which 16 led platoons of the 36 platoons in the first line, and 8\r\n  lieutenants commanded companies. On mobilizing, 25 lieutenants were\r\n  assigned as platoon commanders and six as company commanders in the\r\n  57th Infantry.[67]\r\n\r\n    [67] HÖNIG, _Gefechtsbilder_, I, p. 25. For additional facts in\r\n  regard to the dwindling of the number of officers consult _Die\r\n  sieben Tage von Le Mans_, by V. D. GOLTZ; also _Supplement to\r\n  Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1873, p. 368; also VON KORTZFLEISCH, _Feldzug\r\n  an der Loire_, p. 43.\r\n\r\n  The eight infantry regiments and the Jäger-Battalion of the Xth Army\r\n  Corps had, at this time, instead of the required 506 officers, only\r\n  286, of which number 174 were for duty. The 22nd Infantry Division\r\n  had only 108 officers left; companies and even half-battalions were\r\n  led into action by very young officers of the Reserve, and, on many\r\n  occasions, even by vice 1st sergeants.\r\n\r\n  On the morning of August 17th, 1870, the 40th Füsilier Regiment\r\n  had two field officers and four captains present for duty. Two\r\n  captains, two first lieutenants and eight second lieutenants\r\n  (four of these belonging to the Reserve), led companies; only two\r\n  lieutenants of the Reserve, one cadet, and four vice 1st sergeants\r\n  remained available for duty as platoon commanders. The regiment\r\n  participated in the battle of =Gravelotte= with this small number\r\n  of officers.[68] The 6th Grenadier Regiment, which, in July, 1870,\r\n  had marched out with four field officers, seven captains, six first,\r\n  14 second lieutenants, and four cadets, all on the active list,\r\n  lost so many officers at =Wörth= and =Sedan= that a field officer\r\n  of the 46th Infantry had to take command of the regiment; three\r\n  first lieutenants of battalions; and four second lieutenants, two\r\n  officers of the Reserve, and six vice 1st sergeants of the companies.\r\n  The 12 companies had available five vice 1st sergeants as platoon\r\n  commanders. The 1st Battalion of the 58th Infantry had only seven\r\n  officers left (including its commander and the adjutant) after its\r\n  losses at =Weiszenburg=.[69]\r\n\r\n    [68] KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 8/9, p. 162.\r\n\r\n    [69] _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 58_, p. 56.\r\n\r\n  The 7th Grenadier Regiment lost 40 officers at =Weiszenburg= and\r\n  =Wörth=. On August 7th, three captains commanded the battalions and\r\n  three officers of the 5th Jäger-Battalion were detailed to command\r\n  companies in it.[70] At =Gravelotte= the Füsilier-Battalion of the\r\n  1st, the Ist Battalion of the 2nd, and the IInd Battalion of the\r\n  3rd Regiment of the Guard lost all of their officers. The French\r\n  organizations, having more officers and less men than we, were by no\r\n  means so badly off in 1870-71. Upon mobilizing in 1870, the German\r\n  army had 13.7 officers to every 1,000 men, the French army, 32.2\r\n  officers.\r\n\r\n    [70] KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 14, p. 122.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it should be remembered that in armies consisting\r\nof militia it is considerably more difficult to command a platoon of\r\n60-70 men than to command one of 40-50 men. A disadvantage inseparably\r\nconnected with the four-platoon company is the small size of the\r\nplatoons during peace exercises. On account of this circumstance most\r\nregulations permit the three-platoon formation when the company is\r\nsmall, because platoons consisting of less than ten files are of no\r\ninstructional value. An advantage of the three-platoon company is\r\nthe simplicity and rapidity with which changes from one formation to\r\nanother may be effected.\r\n\r\nThe three-unit column of platoons is very broad for movements on the\r\nbattlefield. It offers, when numbering 200 rifles, a target about\r\n25 m. wide and only 15 m. deep. The four-unit column of platoons is\r\nbetter suited for movements. With a front of 17 m., its depth is only\r\n15 m., when the distances between platoons are assumed to be 6 paces\r\n(Austria, France, Italy, Russia, 5 paces). (See p. 62).\r\n\r\nFor a company consisting of 200 rifles, the following would be the\r\nforms:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe other advantages praised by advocates of the four-unit company are:\r\n\r\n1. That a smaller platoon is more suitable for field service--that a\r\npicket is perhaps only in the rarest cases to be made 60 men strong.\r\n\r\n2. That a small platoon makes a better and more comprehensive\r\nemployment of the company in action possible, as the company commander\r\nhas an opportunity to use ¹⁄₄, ¹⁄₂, or ³⁄₄ of his company according to\r\nthe requirements of the situation, while the three-unit company affords\r\nless favorable combinations, permitting only an employment of ¹⁄₃ or\r\n²⁄₃ of its strength.\r\n\r\nThese advantages can also be obtained in the German company by the\r\nemployment of sections (¹⁄₆, ¹⁄₃, ¹⁄₂, ²⁄₃, ⁵⁄₆) so that the objections\r\nto the three-unit company would appear to be groundless.\r\n\r\nThe platoons (in Italy called _plotone_, in France, _section_) are\r\nsubdivided into sections (_demi-sections_, _Halbzüge_), in Austria\r\ninto two skirmish groups (_Schwärme_) of 4-7 files each, and, when\r\nconsisting of 16 files, into four skirmish groups (in Italy this is\r\nalso done, the groups being called _squadriglio_). In Germany the\r\nplatoons are divided into groups or squads of four files each, and\r\nin Russia the platoons are divided into sections of 8-15 files each\r\nand these again into groups or squads of 4-6 men each. If the squad\r\nis to have any importance at all in action, it must have a leader,\r\nand it might easily happen that a mobilized company lacks the number\r\nof leaders necessary to provide one for each group. The withdrawal\r\nfrom the line of a number of good shots for duty as squad leaders is\r\ncompensated for, in our opinion, by the more thorough supervision over\r\nthe men. This consideration has, however, apparently caused other\r\nstates (Austria and France) not to count on the activity of the squad\r\nleaders in a fire action to the same extent as is the case in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. LENGTH OF PACE AND MARCHING.\r\n\r\nAn extended, swinging step, without haste and without unduly taxing\r\nthe lungs, is advantageous in all movements. When accustomed to this\r\npace on the drill ground, the men will march with practically the\r\nsame step on varied ground, and this appears more desirable than to\r\nshorten the step, while at the same time increasing the distance to be\r\ncovered in a given time. The length of the pace depends largely upon\r\nthe height of the individual, but even small men can maintain a step\r\nof 0.80 m. without undue exertion.[71] In Switzerland the cadence has\r\nbeen fixed at 116-120 steps per minute “with a view of suiting the\r\npeculiarities and the varying degree of mobility which characterize\r\nthe inhabitants of the different cantons.”(!) For purely practical\r\nreasons it is advisable to fix upon some even number of paces in order\r\nthat the cadence may be tested with the watch. (Austria excepted). The\r\nlongest pace in conjunction with the highest cadence (_Bersaglieri_,\r\nwhose march is almost a double time, excepted) is found in England\r\nand Switzerland. Such a performance could not be kept up by a fully\r\nequipped man without impairing health.\r\n\r\n    [71] When the leg is extended at an angle of 57 degrees the length\r\n  of pace would be as follows:\r\n\r\n  Height of man.

In Austria\r\ndouble time is to be maintained for periods of two minutes, quick\r\ntime of five minutes duration alternating, up to sixteen minutes,\r\n_i.e._, until a distance of 1,726 m. has been covered. In Germany,\r\nan alternating quick and double time march in heavy marching order\r\nis prescribed. A different practice prevails in Italy. According\r\nto the Italian Regulations all troops are to be trained to march\r\nin double time without rest and without knapsacks for 2 kilometers\r\n(with knapsacks, 1 km.); _Bersaglieri_ without knapsacks, 3 km. (with\r\nknapsacks, 1¹⁄₂ km.), also without rest (_i.e._, 13 and 16.8 minutes\r\nrespectively). When we consider that in double time with the necessary\r\nalternating step, 2,000 m. can be covered in 17 minutes, and in\r\naccelerated step, in 19-20 minutes, the time gained is unimportant when\r\ncompared to the fatigue of the men and the exertion of the lungs, which\r\ninterferes with deliberate, accurate firing. During an Austrian firing\r\ntest the number of hits fell from 76.5%, attained while advancing in\r\nquick time, to 51% after a period of double time.\r\n\r\nThe run, without keeping step (_Marsch! Marsch!_) is employed in\r\nrapidly crossing short, fire-swept spaces, in changing quickly from one\r\nformation to another, and in the charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. MOVEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN LINE.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the center platoon is the guide.\r\n\r\nA change of direction is effected by inclining toward the new direction\r\n(at the command: “Half right, march!” when the angular change of\r\ndirection is less than 45 degrees), by indicating a new point to march\r\non, or by executing a turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE COLUMNS OF THE COMPANY; MOVEMENTS IN COLUMN; FORMATION OF LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nColumn of Twos.[73]\r\n\r\n    [73] _Reihenkolonne._\r\n\r\nColumn of twos is formed by facing in the indicated direction. Marching\r\nat attention the depth of an organization in column of twos is equal\r\nto its front when in line. The column of twos is used in marching by\r\nthe flank for short distances only, as the march at attention in this\r\nformation unduly fatigues the men. In addition, this formation may be\r\nused, in exceptional cases, on narrow roads; but the column becomes\r\nconsiderably elongated (as much as 165%), when marching at route step.\r\nLine is formed from column of twos either by facing, or by executing\r\nfront into line.\r\n\r\n\r\nColumn of Squads.\r\n\r\nThis is an open column formed (the company being in line at a halt or\r\nin motion) by each squad executing a turn of 90 degrees. It may also\r\nbe formed from line at a halt by the squad on the designated flank\r\nmoving straight to the front, the others executing a turn of 90 degrees\r\ntoward the proper flank, then following the leading squad.[74] Column\r\nof squads may also be formed by executing “Squads right (left), column\r\nright (left).” Line is formed by each squad executing a turn of 90\r\ndegrees or by executing front into line (without regard to the original\r\nfront).\r\n\r\n    [74] “Right forward, fours right.” _Translator._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Column of Squads.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Route Column.]\r\n\r\nRoute column is formed from column of squads by the squads in each\r\nsection closing to facing distance, the file closers, musicians,\r\nand hospital corps men forming ranks of four men, in the gaps thus\r\ncreated. (Par. 91 German I. D. R.) With the exception of Russia, which\r\nemploys a section column, of Switzerland, which uses a column of\r\nsquads, and of France, which has adopted a wheel by fours like that of\r\nthe cavalry, all other armies employ the _column of fours_[75] as their\r\nmarch formation.\r\n\r\n    [75] _Doppelreihenkolonne_.\r\n\r\nColumn of fours is, as a rule, formed as follows:\r\n\r\nThe even numbered men place themselves on the right or left of the odd\r\nnumbered men by making an appropriate turn, thus forming a column of\r\nfours whose length is equal to the front of the company in line. In the\r\nplate below let the Roman numerals represent front rank men, the Arabic\r\nnumerals rear rank men, and the horizontal line the original front\r\noccupied; column of fours will then be formed to the right, in the\r\ndifferent states, as shown:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Austria.\r\n\r\nRussia, England, Belgium, Sweden, and Japan.\r\n\r\nItaly. Netherlands.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of increasing the front of the column, the double\r\ncolumn of squads, having a width of 8 files, may be employed. This\r\nis formed in practice by placing the columns of two organizations\r\n(companies or battalions) side by side. In large bodies of troops,\r\nthe depth of a column is reduced in this manner by one-half. A column\r\nof fours formed by closing on the center instead of by wheeling to a\r\nflank, is employed in Italy and Russia for the purpose of reducing the\r\nfront of an organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison of Column of Fours with Column of Squads.\r\n\r\nThe column of fours has the advantage over our column of squads in that\r\nit can be more quickly and easily formed; that the front rank men must\r\nmake a turn, while, at the same time, observing the march direction,\r\ncan scarcely be considered a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe column of fours and the column of squads have the same depth. The\r\nAustrians consider movements made in column of fours on the battlefield\r\nmore clumsy and fatiguing than when made in column of squads, because\r\nchecks are transmitted to the whole column of fours owing to its\r\nrigidity, while in column of squads the march is easier, more rapid\r\nand more orderly. The squad organization, moreover, facilitates the\r\nemployment of small parties in the service of security and increases\r\nthe importance of the squad leader in fire action. For the last named\r\nreason we should not like to dispense with the column of squads.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Employment of the Column of Squads.\r\n\r\nThe route column is suitable for movements under frontal artillery\r\nfire, as the cone of dispersion of bursting time shrapnel combines\r\nsmall lateral spread with great effect in the direction of depth,\r\nand as it is very difficult for the opponent to observe whether a\r\nshot falls short or goes over, unless it strikes just in front of the\r\ncolumn. When artillery can bring a flanking fire to bear on the column\r\nit becomes necessary to neutralize this by placing the platoons side\r\nby side so as not to present an easily observed target to the enemy.\r\n\r\nMovements by the flank and changes of front are easily made in column\r\nof squads, and after some practice the deployment into line of\r\nskirmishers from this formation offers no difficulties. This column\r\nis best adapted for movements over varied ground. In column of squads\r\ndifficult terrain can be crossed and advantage can be taken of the\r\nmost insignificant cover. In addition, it is difficult for an enemy\r\nto observe a force moving in column of squads along the edge of woods\r\nand rows of trees, and such a column entails the least expenditure of\r\nenergy on the part of the men. The leaders must insist, however, that\r\nthe men cover in file, and that elongation of the column does not take\r\nplace. The column of squads or the route column is therefore to be\r\nemployed on the battlefield as long as possible.\r\n\r\nA column of squads or route column may be shortened by placing the\r\nplatoons, each in column of twos or squads, side by side. By this means\r\nthe =Company Column= (_Kompagniekolonne_) is formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe normal interval between platoons in this formation, measured from\r\nthe leading guide of one platoon to the leading guide of the next in\r\nline, is nine paces. This interval may be increased as required by the\r\nnature of the ground and the intended deployment for action (deployment\r\non a broader front). Movements in company column are facilitated by\r\nthe fact that platoon commanders are posted four paces in front of\r\nthe center of their respective platoons. The leading squad follows\r\nthe platoon leader, the guide of that squad moving directly in that\r\nofficer’s tracks. Thus, small, unimportant deviations, unavoidable on\r\nvaried ground, can easily be adjusted, while too definite rules would\r\ntend to restrict the mobility of the platoon commanders in front of\r\ntheir platoons. The principal thing is that the platoon follow its\r\nleader who guides it without command.\r\n\r\nThe musicians distribute themselves in rear of the platoons in\r\nreadiness for their subsequent duty in action--that of maintaining\r\ncommunication between the several parts of the company. The intervals\r\nof nine paces between platoons are not rigid, but rather the reverse.\r\nThe flexibility of the formation considerably facilitates movements in\r\ndifficult country. This “meandering” of the company over the terrain\r\nrequires special training. The old, historic company column, in which\r\nthe platoons were formed in line one in rear of the other at a distance\r\nof nine paces (Russia 5 paces = 3.55 m., Austria, Italy, France, 6\r\npaces = 4.50 m., and Japan, 8 paces = 6 m.), their commanders on their\r\nrespective right flanks, is now called the\r\n\r\n\r\nColumn of Platoons.\r\n\r\nAustria, France, and Italy have retained the old designation.\r\n\r\nThe front of the column of platoons may be decreased by forming column\r\nof sections. The column of sections is suitable as a route formation on\r\nbroad roads; the transition from column of sections to column of squads\r\nis not difficult, and for the purpose of passing through occasional\r\nnarrow stretches of road, the files on the flanks may be removed. In\r\nmost cases it is, however, more desirable to place several columns\r\nabreast than to employ column of sections, because deployment is\r\nfacilitated in the former case.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany in Column of Platoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Germany.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Russia.]\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= The four squad leaders of each platoon are posted on the\r\n  flanks of the rear rank and in the center of each rank. The ranking\r\n  non-commissioned officer of each platoon stands on the left flank of\r\n  the front rank of his platoon. The 1st sergeant, the guidon bearer,\r\n  and one trumpeter, and behind them two drummers, are posted in rear\r\n  of the company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Austria.]\r\n\r\n  The staves of the guidon flags (_Jalonneurflaggen_) are inserted into\r\n  the rifle barrel of a soldier (in case of a battalion into the rifle\r\n  barrel of a N. C. O.) and serve to indicate battalions and companies.\r\n\r\n  According to the color scheme used in Russia: red = 1, blue = 2,\r\n  white = 3, green = 4. “R” indicates the number of the regiment in\r\n  the division, “B” the number of battalion, and “K” the number of the\r\n  company. A red flag is carried by the 1st Company, and a red flag\r\n  with one green horizontal and one blue vertical stripe is carried by\r\n  the 8th Company of the 1st Regiment of an infantry division. In Japan\r\n  and England so-called storm-flags (small national flags) have been\r\n  adopted to facilitate mutual recognition of friendly troops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nPosts of Platoon Commanders.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, in Russia, and in Germany, the post of platoon\r\ncommanders is on the flanks of their respective platoons when the\r\ncompany is in column of platoons. In England and Austria platoon\r\ncommanders are posted in rear of their platoons, with the exception of\r\nthe commander of the leading platoon, who is posted beside his guide.\r\nIn all other states platoon commanders are posted in front of their\r\nplatoons. Officers are posted in front of their platoons so as to\r\nfacilitate observation on their part, and so that their platoons can\r\nfollow them. This position becomes a necessity when the regulations\r\nrequire that all movements of the company be executed at commands given\r\nby platoon commanders. When they are posted in front of their platoons,\r\nthey cannot supervise their men unless they turn around to do so.\r\n\r\nThe column of platoons is a close column from which line cannot be\r\nformed directly. It has not been found necessary in Germany to provide\r\nan open column permitting prompt deployment toward a flank. The column\r\nof platoons unites the company on the smallest space and facilitates\r\nsupervision, but in companies at full war strength it is not well\r\nadapted for executing changes of front and for taking advantage of\r\ncover, on account of the size of the platoons (40 files each). In\r\nplatoons at war strength the men look more toward the point upon which\r\nthey are to march than upon the enemy, and the deployment of the rear\r\nplatoons offers difficulties which occur principally when a deployment\r\nin an oblique direction or one by the whole company becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nThe column of platoons is formed by the flank platoons placing\r\nthemselves in rear of the center platoon. Line is again formed by rear\r\nplatoons moving to right and left and abreast of the leading platoon.\r\n\r\nThe German company column is much more flexible, and the advantage\r\nof a prompt deployment for action, made possible by the fact that\r\nall platoon commanders and the heads of platoons are in the lead and\r\ntherefore can see the objective, should not be underestimated. The\r\ncompany column is formed from line by the center platoon forming column\r\nof squads to the front (or rear), the flank platoons, each in column\r\nof squads, closing on the center platoon, heads of the three columns\r\non the same line. Company column is formed as follows from column of\r\nplatoons: the leading platoon executes squads right (left), column left\r\n(right), the two rear platoons execute squads right (left), and are\r\nled to a position abreast of the leading platoon. Company column from\r\ncolumn of squads is formed by rear platoons moving to the right and\r\nleft respectively, and abreast of the leading platoon.\r\n\r\nWhen line is to be formed from company column, the flank platoons\r\nhave to incline to the right and left respectively in order to gain\r\nsufficient interval.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovements in Column.\r\n\r\nFor marching short distances to a flank, column of twos may be\r\nemployed; for longer distances, column of squads (or fours); and the\r\nmarch direction may be changed by inclining in the proper direction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince March 1904, experiments, which deserve to be mentioned here,\r\nhave been made in France under the direction of Colonel Fumet, having\r\nfor their object the simplification of the drill regulations. In the\r\nexperiments a four-rank formation is being considered. In this proposed\r\nscheme the platoon is formed so as to place the four single-rank squads\r\n(_escouades_) in rear of each other at the very close facing distance\r\nof 0.50 m., the leaders of the _escouades_ taking post on the right\r\nflank, a first class private being posted on each flank and in the\r\ncenter of each _escouade_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forming Double Rank from the Four-Rank Formation and the\r\nReverse Movement.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deployment of a Half-Platoon formed in Four Ranks into\r\nTwo Half-Platoons formed in Double Rank.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Platoon (_section_) in Line.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deployment of a Half-Platoon Into Line of Skirmishers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Company.]\r\n\r\nThe platoon at war strength (50 men) has a front of 8-10 m. and a\r\ndepth of 3 m. The movements are very simple. Route column is formed by\r\nsimply facing to flank, without first dividing the platoon into squads.\r\nDouble rank line may be formed from column of fours, by executing\r\nright and left front into line. The double rank line may be deployed\r\ninto half-platoons. Furthermore, a single rank line may be formed by\r\nthe men of the rear rank stepping up into the front rank. One drawback\r\nof this scheme is, that, in forming route column, facing distance of\r\n0.80 m. between ranks is to be gradually gained after stepping off.\r\nThe deployment of half-platoons into line of skirmishers offers no\r\ndifficulties. It is otherwise, however, when the platoon is formed in\r\nfour ranks and marching in platoon front, for then line of skirmishers\r\ncan be formed only by deploying each rank in turn. The depth of the\r\ncolumn may be decreased by placing platoons (formed in column of twos\r\nor fours) abreast, this expedient affording a suitable route formation\r\non broad roads. The company is formed by placing the platoons on a\r\nline and abreast of each other at intervals of 2 m. In the battalion,\r\ncolumn of platoons and “mass” are the only formations considered. In\r\nthe “mass” formation the companies, each in line, are in rear of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. THE BATTALION.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the battalion have been considerably simplified\r\nin all armies. Battalion drill is, however, necessary, since, as\r\nshown by the advance of the IInd Army on the morning of August 18th,\r\n1870, simultaneous movements of large masses across country will be\r\nunavoidable in future wars on account of the great size of modern\r\narmies.[76]\r\n\r\n    [76] Additional examples: Advance of the 6th Infantry Division on\r\n  Vionville. _Gen.

The numerical order of companies is\r\nimmaterial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deep Column.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Broad Column.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe deep column is employed for assembling troops if the terrain\r\nnecessitates a formation on a narrow front. If sufficient distance is\r\nallowed between companies, line may be formed to a flank, but this\r\nincreases the depth of the column to such an extent that movements\r\nat attention are impossible. The deep column may be used as a route\r\nformation in addition to the column of squads. During the change from\r\nroute formation to that of action, the deep column formation may be\r\nretained so long as the depth of the whole column does not have to be\r\nfurther reduced. When necessary, the deep column may be replaced by a\r\nformation in which the four companies, each in route column, are placed\r\nabreast of each other.\r\n\r\nThe broad column finds proper employment, aside from parades, in cases\r\nwhere the terrain or the contemplated deployment requires more front\r\nthan depth. It is also advisable to assemble the widely scattered\r\ntroops in a broad column after an action. The broad column does\r\nnot lend itself, however, to the execution of changes of front by\r\nbattalion; but should such changes of front become necessary, they are\r\nalways to be executed by company.\r\n\r\nThe color is posted between the right and left center companies, in\r\nbroad column, and on the right flank of the third company, in deep\r\ncolumn. In action the color remains with the company with which it\r\nhappens to be at the moment.[77] Should this company also join the\r\nfiring line, the color accompanies it; but under all circumstances one\r\nsquad must remain with the color. (Par. 236 German I. D. R.). It has\r\nbeen contended that this is a disadvantage, as the enemy can direct\r\nhis fire on the color and the men in its vicinity. If the colors, upon\r\nwhich the soldiers have been sworn, are taken into the field, it is\r\nalways better to endure the unavoidable losses incidental to carrying\r\nthem, and even to expose them to capture, than to send them back to\r\na safe place under escort.[78] At the Albrechtshaus farm (Wörth)\r\nthe colors served as rallying points around which the disordered\r\nskirmishers rapidly assembled.[79]\r\n\r\n    [77] In Japan the color joins the battalion commander. British\r\n  troops leave their colors in their garrisons. In Russia and France\r\n  the color is carried only by one battalion of each regiment.\r\n\r\n    [78] See KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 14, p. 180,\r\n  battle of Wörth. A platoon of the Füsilier-Battalion of the 47th\r\n  Infantry was sent to the rear with the color, and a squad of the\r\n  Füsilier-Battalion of the 46th Infantry finally had six colors\r\n  to guard. In the 88th Infantry, out of a total of 48 sections, 9\r\n  sections remained in rear as a guard for 2 colors, but finally 6 of\r\n  these sections crossed the Sauer.\r\n\r\n    [79] KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 13, pp. 77, 152.\r\n\r\nThe figures given on pages 72 and 73 of the German Infantry Drill\r\nRegulations illustrate formations with organizations at peace strength.\r\nThe approximate dimensions of broad and deep columns at war strength\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= Numerous formations are prescribed. In addition to route\r\n  column, columns with half company front and with company front are\r\n  prescribed. Reserve columns are mentioned. These, according to the\r\n  number of companies on the same line, are called single platoon\r\n  column (deep column), two platoon column (double column), or four\r\n  platoon column.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= _The mass_, in which the companies of the battalion are\r\n  on the same line, each company in company column[80] with intervals\r\n  of three paces between companies, is employed for assembling the\r\n  battalion in a restricted space in a position in readiness when out\r\n  of range of hostile fire, or for assembling the battalion under\r\n  cover. The _line of columns_, in which the companies, each in column\r\n  or some other suitable formation, are formed abreast of each other at\r\n  deploying intervals plus three paces, is also used.\r\n\r\n    [80] In the Austrian company column (_Kompagniekolonne_), the\r\n  platoons, each in line, are formed one in rear of the other. This\r\n  formation was formerly called company column (_Kompagniekolonne_)\r\n  by the Germans also, but at present they designate it by the term\r\n  “column of platoons” (_Zugkolonne_). _Translator._\r\n\r\n  _The line._ In this formation the companies, each in line, are placed\r\n  abreast of each other at intervals of three paces.\r\n\r\n  _The column._ In this formation the companies are placed in rear of\r\n  each other, each either in line or in column, with distances of nine\r\n  paces between companies. The companies are numbered 1st, 2nd, 3rd,\r\n  4th, etc., from head to rear, if in column, and from right to left,\r\n  if in line.\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= The formations are like those of Austria, but the double\r\n  column has been retained.\r\n\r\n  =Japan.= The only formations prescribed are the broad and deep column.\r\n\r\n  =France.= The companies are formed in column or in _ligne de sections\r\n  par quatre_, intervals and distances being 10 paces. Distances and\r\n  intervals may be increased when required. The _battalion in line_ in\r\n  which the companies are formed in line in numerical order, abreast of\r\n  each other at intervals of six paces, is only retained as a parade\r\n  formation.\r\n\r\n  _Line of company columns_ (_ligne de colonnes_). Companies abreast\r\n  with intervals of six paces.\r\n\r\n  _Deep column_ (_colonne de bataillon_). The companies in normal\r\n  formation in rear of each other at distances of 10 paces.\r\n\r\n  _Double column_ (_colonne double_). Intervals and distances 10 paces.\r\n\r\n  The formation in which the companies are abreast of each other, each\r\n  in column of fours at deploying intervals, is employed in marching\r\n  across country and also under artillery fire. Only the regiment\r\n  carries a color, the battalion a guidon (_fanion_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Deep Column=\r\n\r\n(_colonne de bataillon_).\r\n\r\nThe companies in line of platoons in column of fours (_ligne de\r\nsections par quatre_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Double Column=\r\n\r\n(_colonne double_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Deep Column=\r\n\r\n(_colonne de bataillon_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Line of Company Columns=\r\n\r\n(_ligne de colonnes_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Double Column=\r\n\r\n(_colonne double_).\r\n\r\nThe companies in line of platoons in column of fours (_ligne de\r\nsections par quatre_).]\r\n\r\n  =England.= Columns are formed, in view of the (8) weak companies in\r\n  a battalion, with company or half-company front at full or reduced\r\n  distances (_quarter column_). In actions with savages echelon\r\n  formations and the square are also employed.\r\n\r\n  =Switzerland.= The company is divided into four platoons. The line is\r\n  used as an assembly formation and for purposes of parade. The company\r\n  column, corresponding to the German formation of the same name, is\r\n  used for movements on the battlefield. In both line and company\r\n  column the platoons are posted abreast, at intervals of three paces.\r\n  Finally the route column is used. This is formed either by wheeling\r\n  by squads, or by platoons executing column right (left). On the\r\n  battlefield the platoon may be deployed and formed in several lines.\r\n\r\n  In the battalion, company columns in line of columns, or route\r\n  columns in the battalion column, are posted abreast at intervals of\r\n  10 paces. Line and double column are abolished.\r\n\r\nOpinions are divided as to the value of the double column. Formerly,\r\nwhen the double column was still the column of attack from which\r\ndeployment for fire action had to be made, a discussion of its merits\r\nwas of special importance. While Austria abandoned the double column\r\nformation in 1881 and Germany in 1905, Switzerland replaced it by a\r\ncolumn having a front of two platoons (_Plotonkolonne_), and Russia\r\nreadopted it again recently. All other states utilize it as of equal\r\nvalue with the deep column in making movements beyond range of\r\nartillery fire and as an assembly formation in addition to the deep\r\ncolumn. The change from double column to any company column formation\r\nis easier than a like change from the Swiss “Ploton column” (double\r\ncolumn of platoons), which has the same front, since in the double\r\ncolumn two companies can be deployed at the same time toward both\r\nflanks.\r\n\r\nThe deep column appears to be better adapted for making movements and\r\nfor advancing under cover, and, on account of its narrow front, a force\r\nin this formation is better able to adapt itself to the forms of the\r\nground in hilly or close country than a body of troops in double column\r\nof twice the width of front.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Battalion in Route Column.\r\n\r\n(Par. 316 German F. S. R.).\r\n\r\nThe companies are formed in route column and follow each other at\r\ndistances of 8 m. Mounted officers, musicians,[81] led horses and\r\nvehicles are to be included in actual depths of columns given and not\r\nin the distances. A permanent extension of distances for the purpose of\r\nrestricting checks of the march to a single organization is as little\r\npermissible as the permanent elimination or reduction of distances;\r\ndistances may be dispensed with temporarily only. The reduction of the\r\ndepth of a column, obtained by eliminating distances between elements\r\nentirely, is so small that the rapidity of deployment gained does not,\r\nby any means, compensate for the increased exertion of the troops.[82]\r\n\r\n    [81] A trumpeter marches in rear of the battalion for the purpose\r\n  of blowing “Give way,” when necessary to open one side of the road.\r\n  At this signal all the troops close in toward the flank of the guide.\r\n\r\n    [82] The depth of a brigade of six battalions on the march is\r\n  about 2500 m. By eliminating distances between elements a space of\r\n  only 100 m. is gained, while by marching in a front of six files,\r\n  approximately 750 m. is gained. The march of the 10th Infantry\r\n  Division from Weiszenburg to Preuschdorf, on August 5th, 1870, proved\r\n  exceedingly fatiguing. The distances between organizations had been\r\n  eliminated pursuant to orders. “Some of the rearmost elements had to\r\n  double time uphill to keep up whenever the head of the column went\r\n  down hill. Great fatigue and many cases of overexertion were the\r\n  result.” _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 37_, p. 124.\r\n\r\nDuring the march the company commander goes wherever his presence may\r\nbe necessary for the proper supervision of his company. Neither are\r\nplatoon commanders tied to a fixed place; one officer is, however,\r\nrequired to march in rear of the company. The company ammunition\r\nwagons follow in rear of their respective companies, or, assembled, in\r\nrear of the battalion. In marches in campaign the field train marches\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the battalion on the march, without field train, is 400\r\nm., and the depth of the field train is 100 m.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= Column of fours. Depth of a battalion on the march,\r\n  including combat train, 670 paces (502 m.). The distance between\r\n  companies is nine paces (6.7 m.).\r\n\r\n  =France.= The distance between companies is 10 paces (7.5 m.). The\r\n  depth of each rank is reckoned at 1.40 m. on the march (in Germany\r\n  1.10 m.), and that of every 100 men at 50 m. Depth of a battalion,\r\n  including combat train, on the march is 450 m.\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= The distance between companies is 10 paces (7.1 m.). The\r\n  battalion without combat train has a depth of 350 paces (249 m.). The\r\n  combat train follows in rear of the regiment.\r\n\r\n  A German regiment of four battalions with combat train has a depth of\r\n  1,650 m. on the march; a Russian regiment, a depth of 1,725 paces (@\r\n  71 cm.)=1,215 m. (elongation on the march not considered).\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= The distance between companies is 10 paces (7.5 m.). The\r\n  battalion has a depth of 422 m. on the march.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE REGIMENT AND THE BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nFor a discussion of the importance of the regiment and of the brigade\r\nsee page 37 _supra_. All movements must be executed in an orderly\r\nmanner by regiment and brigade, in any formation, without breaking up\r\ntactical units, and the entity of the whole body must be preserved at\r\nthe same time by a skillful use of the terrain. If necessary, a base\r\nbattalion may be designated.\r\n\r\nWhen regiments or brigades are assembled, the formation, disposition,\r\nintervals and distances of the tactical units depend upon the terrain\r\nand the intentions of the commander. Frequently the tactical units\r\n(battalions and regiments) are assembled in separate groups.\r\n\r\nWhen considerations of the enemy and the terrain do not dictate\r\notherwise, the battalions, each, as a rule, in deep column, are\r\nposted in one or more lines, at 30-pace intervals and distances,\r\nrear battalions covering those in front or the gaps between them. An\r\nappropriate formation will frequently be that in which route columns\r\nare placed abreast and on the same line.\r\n\r\nIn the brigade, when assembled or deployed, the regiments may be placed\r\nabreast of each other, on the same line, or in rear of each other,\r\n_i.e._, in line or in echelon. When the regiments are formed side by\r\nside, two adjacent independent sections are created, each commanded\r\nby a regimental commander; this insures better supervision, better\r\ncontrol, and a more energetic conduct of the action, since the first\r\nline can be reinforced by troops belonging to the same organization.\r\nThis formation, moreover, facilitates tactical combinations. It may,\r\nhowever, be a disadvantage that the first line is not subject to the\r\norders of a single commander; that it is difficult to employ the\r\nreserve battalions in one body; and that the brigade commander can\r\ninfluence the action only by withdrawing units from the regiments for\r\nthe purpose of forming a reserve.[83] The echelon formation, each\r\nechelon consisting of a regiment, is frequently used in rencontres,\r\nbecause troops are thrown into action directly from route column.\r\nThe regimental commanders then become leaders of echelons, the first\r\nline cannot be reinforced by its own troops, and the organizations of\r\ndifferent regiments finally become mixed. The echelon formation is\r\nproper only when the second line is intended to be used independently\r\nabreast of the first in the course of the action; for example, on a\r\nflank, for the purpose of making or warding off a flank attack.[84]\r\nWhen part of a larger force, the most suitable combat formation for\r\ntroops is usually the one in which the regiments are formed side by\r\nside.\r\n\r\n    [83] For historical reference as to the importance of the brigade\r\n  in action, see essay published in _Jahrbücher für Armee und Marine_\r\n  (August and September numbers 1877) entitled: _Die Infanterie Brigade\r\n  in ihrer Entwickelung aus der Brigade von 1812_. In regard to the\r\n  employment of regiments in line or in echelon, see Memoir by General\r\n  von Moltke on the tactical lessons gained in the campaign of 1866.\r\n  MOLTKE, _Taktisch-strategische Aufsätze_, p. 99, et seq.\r\n\r\n    [84] The fight of François’ Brigade at Spicheren. _Gen. St. W._ I,\r\n  p. 310, et seq. The formation, side by side, of the six battalions\r\n  of the IIIrd Army Corps in the attack on the hill at Forbach\r\n  (Spicheren) would have been inappropriate and would have disrupted\r\n  all organizations.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of the echelon formation, when taken up from route\r\ncolumn, can be obviated by deploying the second regiment in rear of a\r\nflank of the first. It should be kept intact in that position until the\r\ndecisive moment, although the state of the fight may, at the outset,\r\ninvite a more rapid extension of front.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. EXTENDED ORDER.\r\n\r\nCombats are begun and carried out in extended order. The defender can\r\nbe induced to disclose his dispositions, to occupy his position, and\r\nto open fire, only by the advance upon him of a skirmish line. The\r\ndeployment of a thin firing line will frequently suffice to furnish\r\nthe commander of the attacking force with a clue to the strength of\r\nthe force holding the hostile position. In close country, skirmishers\r\nare pushed forward primarily to guard against surprise the force which\r\nsends them out, but when thrown forward only a few hundred meters in\r\nopen country, such skirmishers are unable to furnish protection. The\r\nstrength and density of a firing line (by means of which the fight is\r\nsustained) depend upon marksmanship, upon the purpose of the action,\r\nand upon the terrain. The poorer the marksmanship or the weapon, or\r\nthe more unfavorable the field of fire, the greater the number of\r\nskirmishers needed (_i.e._, the denser the firing line).[85] If the\r\nenemy is merely to be kept at a distance, less skirmishers (_i.e._,\r\na thinner firing line furnished with plenty of ammunition) will be\r\nrequired, than if the action is to be carried to a decisive conclusion.\r\n\r\n    [85] The Boers with their superior weapons and better marksmanship,\r\n  and further because they never cared to become involved in a fight at\r\n  close quarters, found thin firing lines sufficient.\r\n\r\nCohesion and order are best maintained, and the least time is lost in\r\naction, if efficient, dense firing lines are led forward as units up to\r\nthe moment of opening fire. (Pars. 169, 321, 334 and 413 German I. D.\r\nR.). But on open terrain such dense firing lines would begin to suffer\r\ntoo great a loss at ranges at which they could not reply to the fire.\r\nNothing remains then but to cover the available front with a very thin\r\nfiring line, followed at irregular distances by thin skirmish lines\r\nwhich ploy for the purpose of utilizing cover or for opening fire.\r\nSkirmish lines of this description will hardly justify the opponent’s\r\nexpenditure of ammunition, as he can only cover broad spaces with\r\nvolley fire. On the other hand, these skirmish lines are in themselves\r\ntoo weak to facilitate the approach of the following echelons by their\r\nfire. Besides, it must not be overlooked that the soldier, separated by\r\na considerable interval from his comrades in line during the advance,\r\nand withdrawn from the influence of his officers, succumbs more easily\r\nto temporary spells of weakness and is more apt to remain behind\r\nthan the skirmisher in a dense firing line. The advance in several\r\nsuccessive, thin skirmish lines is therefore only an expedient. In each\r\ncase the leaders will have to decide whether, in view of the close\r\nproximity of the enemy, a united advance with dense, powerful skirmish\r\nlines is possible or advisable (for instance, when entering at once\r\nupon the decisive stage of the action). Before opening fire the firing\r\nlines must be sufficiently reinforced. (Par. 334 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThis advance in thin skirmish lines stood the test both in the Boer war\r\nand in the Russo-Japanese war,[86] but we must not forget that thin\r\nskirmish lines are only maneuver formations in an attack that is to be\r\npushed home, and that the mistake made by the British of attempting to\r\nmake an attack with such weak skirmish lines should not be imitated.\r\nThe Japanese also used this formation after they had once opened fire\r\nwith a dense skirmish line.[87]\r\n\r\n    [86] Four battalions of the 6th Division advanced at Paardeberg on\r\n  February 18th, 1900, on a front of 2000 m. with 800-1000 rifles, in\r\n  two lines of equal strength and separated by a distance of 300 m.,\r\n  the remainder following at 400 m. Three battalions of the Highland\r\n  Brigade even advanced on a front of 4000 m. See my lecture: _Lehren\r\n  des Burenkrieges_. _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 33, pp. 43\r\n  and 67.\r\n\r\n    For the Japanese procedure see V. LÜTTWITZ, _Angriffsverfahren der\r\n  Japaner_, pp. 44 and 66. BRONSART VON SCHELLENDORFF, _Sechs Monate\r\n  beim japanischen Feldheer_, p. 217.\r\n\r\n    [87] In regard to the advance of the 6th Reserve Regiment\r\n  against Husanta-Kantsy at Mukden, on March 5th, 1905, BRONSART VON\r\n  SCHELLENDORFF (_Angriffsverfahren der Japaner_, p. 225), says: “Some\r\n  500-600 m. from the Russian position, individual men sprang out of\r\n  the shelter trench at intervals of 10-25 paces, rushed forward for\r\n  about 30 m., or perhaps farther, where they threw themselves down and\r\n  fired. This procedure was repeated until a new skirmish line, with\r\n  the men approximately 3 paces apart, had been formed about 100-150\r\n  m. in front of the trench mentioned. The rest of the men, who until\r\n  this moment had remained in the trench, now rushed forward in groups\r\n  of 5-10 men for distances of 30 m., for the purpose of reaching the\r\n  advanced line.”\r\n\r\nIt might be well to mention here that thin and dense skirmish lines,\r\nwhen under fire, lose an equal number of men in proportion to their\r\nstrength, provided the front occupied by them is the same.\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF A FIRING TEST AGAINST THIN AND DENSE SKIRMISH LINES.\r\n\r\n  FIRE AT WILL, FREEHAND FROM A PRONE POSITION.\r\n  ============+===========+=======+======+====+=======+========+=======\r\n              |           |       |      |    | Hits. | Figures|\r\n              |   Range & |       |      |    +---+---+  hit.  |\r\n    Target.   | Elevation:|No. of |No. of|Time|   |   +---+----+Figures\r\n              |     m.    |rifles.|shots.|min.|   | % |   |  % |missed.\r\n  ------------+-----------+-------+------+----+---+---+---+----+-------\r\n  180 head    |    680    |  166  | 1268 |  5 | 54| 4 | 49| 27 | 131\r\n  targets     |Elevation  |       |      |    |   |   |   |    |\r\n  placed at   |used: first|       |      |    |   |   |   |    |\r\n  intervals of|600 then   |       |      |    |   |   |   |    |\r\n  1-2 paces.  |700 m.     |       |      |    |   |   |   |    |\r\n  ------------+-----------+-------+------+----+---+---+---+----+-------\r\n  90 head     |    680    |  166  |  850 |  5 | 35| 4 | 27| 30 |  63\r\n  targets     |Elevation  |       |      |    |   |   |   |    |\r\n  placed at   |used: first|       |      |    |   |   |   |    |\r\n  intervals of|600 then   |       |      |    |   |   |   |    |\r\n  3-4 paces.  |700 m.     |       |      |    |   |   |   |    |\r\n  ------------+-----------+-------+------+----+---+---+---+----+-------\r\n\r\nThe superior effect of fire on the dense skirmish line, as expressed\r\nby the greater number of hits, and in consequence thereof, by the\r\ngradually growing number of figures hit, is apparent. It is worthy\r\nof note and at first glance strange that, presupposing the two lines\r\nconsidered occupy an equal front, the percentage of figures hit is\r\nthe same. The explanation of this lies in the fact that in correctly\r\ndistributed fire any specified front space is equally covered with\r\nhits so that it is immaterial for the relative proportion of figures\r\nhit whether an equal number of figures is removed or added. While,\r\nhowever, the dense skirmish line still has 131 effectives, the\r\nweaker line has only 63 left. The casualties are therefore far more\r\nperceptible in the smaller force.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) The Formation of the Skirmish Line.\r\n\r\nSkirmish line with intervals of two paces between the men is formed at\r\nthe command, “As Skirmishers.” (Pars. 142 and 174-180 German I. D. R.).\r\nThe skirmish line may be deployed from any formation, in any direction,\r\neither with or without first changing front. (Par. 177 German I. D.\r\nR.). A greater interval than two paces must be specifically ordered.\r\nSquad leaders hasten in front of their squads and form the framework\r\nof the skirmish line. The men follow their squad leaders absolutely.\r\nWhen the terrain requires it, squad leaders may increase or diminish\r\nintervals without command. In other armies (for instance, in those\r\nof Italy, France, and England) the desire to keep the skirmishers\r\nunder control as long as possible, has led to advancing the platoons\r\ndesignated for the firing line at first in close order, the deployment\r\nbeing made only when the state of the action requires it. In France,\r\nthe intervals between files may be increased, or a single rank line\r\nmay be formed before the force is deployed as skirmishers. During an\r\nadvance it will often happen that intervals are increased or diminished\r\nin accordance with the peculiarities of the terrain. The advance is\r\ncontinued until the command or signal “Halt” is given. If line of\r\nskirmishers is to be formed when marching to the rear, the command is\r\nfirst faced to the front and then deployed on the line then occupied.\r\n(Rallying position, par. 180 German I. D. R.). On varied ground,\r\ndeployments will be made under cover whenever possible in order to\r\nallow of an immediate advance in skirmish line from that point. The\r\nnumber of platoons to be deployed depends upon the tactical situation.\r\nWhen three deployed platoons are formed abreast, it is difficult\r\nfor the company commander to control them; but this formation is an\r\nappropriate one if a company is surprised or enters immediately into\r\ndecisive action, or in cases where the battalion acting alone requires\r\ncomplete units in reserve for additional tasks. (Pars. 462, 463 and 469\r\nGerman I. D. R.). When the battalion is engaged as part of a larger\r\nforce, it is a good plan to occupy all the available front space at\r\nonce with skirmishers and to maintain the intensity of fire of the\r\nfiring line by constantly reinforcing it. The losses are less in this\r\ncase than when the men crowd together in groups. (Italy).\r\n\r\nPlatoon and squad leaders are posted on the side of their commands\r\nfacing the enemy while advancing; in moving to the rear, squad leaders\r\nare posted on the side away from the enemy, their duty being to\r\nmaintain the march direction, and the platoon commanders remain in rear\r\nof their platoons (_i.e._, on the side toward the enemy). Russia is the\r\nonly country where the leaders of a firing line are posted in the rear.\r\nIn Austria one non-commissioned officer in each platoon is designated\r\nto march in rear of the advancing firing line for the purpose of\r\nsupervising the skirmishers. As this non-commissioned officer is to\r\nprevent straggling, he should be selected with great care.\r\n\r\nThe platoon commander indicates the march direction to the leader\r\nof the base squad, and, accompanied by the range finders and the\r\nmusicians, moves to a point at least ten paces in front of the line\r\nof his squad leaders, as a rule, opposite the center of his platoon;\r\nbut he is not restricted to this position. He must possess mobility\r\nif he desires to lead his platoon skillfully on varied ground, if he\r\nexpects to avoid interfering with neighboring platoons, and if he\r\nwishes to observe the enemy at the same time. The musician keeps the\r\ncompany commander constantly in view. (Par. 221 German I. D. R.).\r\nThe range finders observe the battlefield, estimate the range to any\r\ntargets appearing in view, without being specifically told to do so,\r\ncommunicate the range found to the platoon commander (this should not\r\nbe done by shouting, as misunderstandings might result therefrom), and\r\nobserve the effect of the fire. (Par. 173 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nWhenever the flanks of a skirmish line are not protected by other\r\ntroops or by natural obstacles, a few men under a prudent leader should\r\nalways be sent out as combat patrols to the flank, or better still, to\r\nthe right or left front. The patrol should under no circumstances lose\r\nconnection with the command which it is to protect, but, on the other\r\nhand, should not stick so close to it that the file on the exposed\r\nflank is in a position to see as much as the combat patrol itself. As a\r\nreport from a combat patrol frequently arrives too late, or cannot be\r\nmade at all on account of hostile fire, signals should be agreed upon\r\nand the leader of the squad on the exposed flank of the line should\r\nkeep the combat patrol constantly in view. Signal flags may also be\r\nemployed advantageously in such cases.\r\n\r\n  The =Austrian= deployment is similar to the German, the intervals\r\n  between skirmishers being about two paces. In =Italy= the skirmishers\r\n  are posted at intervals of 1.5 m. (_catena ordinaria_), but this\r\n  interval may be increased by order up to three paces (_catena rada_).\r\n  The interval between squads in extended order is 4-5 paces to\r\n  facilitate volley fire by squad. The =French= deployment is similar\r\n  to the German. An intermediate extended order formation is that in\r\n  which an advance is made in line, the files at extended intervals. In\r\n  =England= skirmishers are placed at intervals of 5-15 paces during\r\n  the initial deployment. At short ranges where the decision is sought,\r\n  one rifle per 2-3 yards of front (1.8-2.7 m.) is the rule, one rifle\r\n  per yard of front (0.90 m.) being the maximum. In =Russia= and\r\n  =Japan= the intervals are as ordered. In =Switzerland= skirmishers\r\n  are posted at intervals of 1-2 paces; when a greater front is to be\r\n  covered the intervals between squads are increased. The length of the\r\n  rushes depends on the ground, the effect of fire, and the endurance\r\n  of the men. In exceptional cases an advance by rushes, by squads or\r\n  single men, is authorized.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) Movements in Skirmish Line.\r\n\r\nFire action requires steady breathing, and, on this account, all\r\nmovements to the position at which the fire fight is to be taken up,\r\nshould be made, as long as possible, in a free swinging stride. A\r\ncareful observation of alignment or of intervals cannot be insisted\r\nupon. Cover found within the allotted front should be utilized\r\nby ploying, but this must neither interfere with the harmonious\r\nadvance of the entire force nor cause a loss of the march direction.\r\nConsiderations of cover for individual men should not interfere with\r\nthe spontaneous progress of the movement. Orderly movements in long\r\nskirmish lines are best made by designating a certain element as the\r\n_base_, whose leader is far in advance of it; all neighboring leaders\r\nmaintain their intervals from, and endeavor to remain approximately on\r\nline with him. This has the advantage of relieving the commander of\r\nthe whole line from looking after these details and leaves him free\r\nto concentrate all his attention on the enemy. Minor changes of the\r\nmarch direction are executed by inclining to the right or left or by\r\ndesignating a new objective. More extended movements by the flank,\r\nwithin range of hostile fire, are possible only under cover. Changes\r\nof direction are executed like a gradual front into line, in which a\r\ntemporary echeloning of the elements, or one which can be adjusted by\r\ndegrees, is unavoidable. (Par. 185 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIn the absence of cover, an advance in quick time will be possible\r\nonly at long ranges unless the hostile fire can be kept down by fire\r\nfrom enfilading or commanding positions. Skirmish lines advancing\r\nwithout fire support over ground devoid of cover, begin to suffer\r\nappreciable losses at 1000 m. The more effective the hostile fire, the\r\nmore pressing the necessity of diminishing, as far as this is possible,\r\nthe periods of time during which the skirmishers present their whole\r\nbodies as targets to the enemy. This leads in itself[88] to an =advance\r\nby rushes=, since the whole distance separating the advancing line\r\nfrom the enemy cannot be covered in one rush. Double time may be\r\nemployed by a skirmish line when it becomes necessary to reinforce an\r\nadvancing firing line quickly, to forestall the enemy in reaching a\r\ncertain point, or in moving under fire, from the covered fire position\r\noccupied, to another position. It is impossible to prescribe definitely\r\nand for all cases at what ranges the advance by rushes should be taken\r\nup and when fire should be opened in advancing by rushes, since it\r\ndepends upon the intensity of the hostile fire.\r\n\r\n    [88] KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 14, pp. 40, 48 and 77.\r\n\r\nThe assailant will, in the first place, endeavor to advance without\r\nfiring, in order to reach those ranges quickly at which his fire\r\nwill begin to be effective against the well-covered targets of the\r\ndefender. The skirmishers advance in strong detachments, by rushes\r\nof the greatest possible length, taking short breathing spells at\r\neach halt. Very soon, however, the hostile fire makes this advance\r\nimpossible. A fire fight of variable duration must first make a further\r\nadvance possible by silencing the fire of the defender. In a serious\r\ninfantry engagement every step forward must be purchased by the fire\r\nof the attacking infantry. The attacker will, in exceptional cases\r\nonly, continue his advance in long lines, although this must appear\r\ndesirable to him, for almost invariably only a part of his force will\r\nstill be able to gain ground to the front when supported by the fire\r\nof neighboring detachments. Favorable local conditions, insignificant\r\nlosses, and, above all, the personality of the commander will embue a\r\nforce with the determination to advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime Required for Making a Rush. Strength of the Force Making the Rush.\r\n\r\nThe squad requires 5-6, the platoon at war strength about 10-15 seconds\r\npreparation for making a rush.\r\n\r\n  To cover 80 m., requires 26-30 seconds;\r\n   „   „   40 „      „     17-20    „\r\n   „   „   25 „      „     10-15    „\r\n\r\nWhile the attacker covers a distance of 80 m., the defender, if in\r\nreadiness, can fire 4-5 shots. This proves very clearly that, in order\r\nto be able to make such a rush, a certain superiority of fire is\r\nabsolutely essential. These figures change radically as soon as the\r\ntroops are seriously engaged with the enemy and come under his fire\r\nat short ranges. At short ranges, aside from the size of the target\r\noffered, attempts to advance by rushes with entire companies must very\r\nsoon cease of their own accord.\r\n\r\nThe character of the terrain and the fire of the enemy play a decisive\r\nrole here.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the force making the rush is intimately connected with\r\nthe length of the rushes. A small, isolated force would run the risk of\r\nbeing fired on by its own neighboring detachments. Besides, confidence\r\nand moral courage are difficult to find in a small force. It is\r\ndifficult to carry forward long lines as units. The use of long lines\r\nnecessitates, as a rule, an almost complete cessation of fire, and, in\r\naddition, mutual fire support suffers. Long lines should therefore be\r\nemployed only when the attacker possesses a very marked superiority of\r\nfire. In practice it has been found advantageous to make the rush with\r\nthe smallest fraction led by an officer, _i.e._, with a platoon.\r\n\r\n  The following appropriate statement appears in _Taktische Rückblicke\r\n  auf 1866_: “In the danger zone which suddenly surrounds and startles\r\n  him in war, the soldier feels, in the first place, a desire to have\r\n  someone assure him that the seemingly critical situation in which\r\n  he finds himself, is as it should be. His eye is naturally directed\r\n  upon his officers. If the officer’s quiet glance reminds him that\r\n  here, as in peace time, the first duty is obedience, and if he sees\r\n  the officer subsequently advance fearlessly and vigorously, he will,\r\n  as a rule, not worry about the why and wherefor. It is this faithful\r\n  attachment to the person of his officer, rather than ambition and\r\n  patriotism, which inspires the soldier to highest efforts. Those\r\n  who suppose that all our soldiers are heroes simply because they\r\n  are products of a courageous race, are very much mistaken. This\r\n  would indeed be an invincible army, requiring no tactical advice,\r\n  if its soldiers would do nothing in action but their simple duty\r\n  voluntarily.”\r\n\r\nThe severest test of discipline is for a skirmish line to rise and\r\nrush forward under an effective hostile fire. This movement had best\r\nbe executed with precision and energy even during peace exercises. The\r\nformation and manner of execution must become second nature to the\r\nsoldier, like a movement of the manual of arms, which he retains during\r\nhis entire military service, and a knowledge of which he brings with\r\nhim when called to the colors during mobilization. The example set by\r\nadvancing leaders and the arrival of reinforcements, which move forward\r\nthrough the firing line, have been found to be the most effective means\r\nof carrying a skirmish line forward.\r\n\r\nThe critical moment occurs when the men rise and prepare to rush\r\nforward, for an unsubdued enemy will be desirous to prevent, by\r\nincreasing his fire, any attempt to advance. The fire support afforded\r\nby neighboring detachments would seem to have a conditional value only;\r\nfor, being themselves under fire, the skirmishers of these detachments\r\ncannot be expected to divert their fire from the opponent previously\r\nfired upon, to an enemy by whom they themselves are not threatened. In\r\noblique fire, the rifles, on account of their short barrel, interfere\r\nwith neighboring ones, and, in addition, expose the men advancing on\r\nthe flanks to the danger of being hit by the fire of their comrades.\r\nThe fire support is, therefore, restricted to hindering the hostile\r\nskirmishers directly opposite from firing on the advancing unit. When\r\nthe terrain is favorable, infantry and machine guns should not hesitate\r\nto fire over the heads of their own skirmishers. The coöperation of\r\nartillery will, in any case, be of great value, and infantry will have\r\nto select those moments for advancing when the defender is driven under\r\ncover by the hail of shot.\r\n\r\nThe advance by rushes, consuming time and energy, is an expedient to\r\nwhich the enemy compels us to resort as the only means of gaining\r\nground to the front. The firm determination to close with the enemy\r\nand the ever-increasing difficulty of inducing the men to advance from\r\ncover, require that long rushes be made. Short rushes are neither\r\nconsonant with the nature of the attack, nor with the desire to\r\nclose with the enemy. “Many halts during an advance are fatal to the\r\noffensive.” (HÖNIG). The powers of endurance of the men, the character\r\nof the ground, and the hostile fire, as well as the support afforded\r\nby infantry and artillery fire, influence the length of the rush. If\r\nthe leader has already caused the skirmishers to rise, it is best to\r\nlet them run forward so long as the physical powers of the men and\r\nthe hostile fire permit. The only danger is that the men will throw\r\nthemselves down prematurely, and without orders. It is rather an\r\nadvantage that during the rapid advance, increasing both muscular and\r\nnervous activity, the men do not think of danger and have no time to\r\npay attention to their fallen comrades. One fact is, however, worthy of\r\nspecial attention: If we train a soldier to make long rushes in time of\r\npeace, he will be able to make them in time of war, and it is easier\r\nfor a leader to decrease than to increase the length of rushes in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe short rushes are considered advantageous because they take the\r\nenemy by surprise, in consequence of which he is not in a condition\r\nto direct his fire on the advancing unit. Rushes should be made with\r\nstartling suddenness. They should not be made in step at double time,\r\nbut, on the contrary, as rapidly as possible (by rushing); by the time\r\nthe enemy directs his fire on them, the skirmishers should already\r\nhave thrown themselves down. Stragglers should also throw themselves\r\ndown, when the men in the lead drop down behind cover, and should then\r\nendeavor to reach the firing line by crawling.\r\n\r\nThe enemy will concentrate his fire on the unit which advanced first.\r\nThe fire of this unit will at the start be rather weak, getting\r\nstronger gradually. If this unit is left in its advanced position for\r\nsome time there is danger of its being thrown back; all neighboring\r\nunits must therefore endeavor to rejoin it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe greater the superiority of our fire, _i.e._, the marksmanship which\r\ncompels the enemy to keep under cover, the greater the length of the\r\nrushes and the rapidity with which they follow upon each other.\r\n\r\nShort rushes with small units occur quite naturally, because the\r\nplatoon leader no longer succeeds in inducing his whole platoon to\r\nrise, since his influence extends only to the men nearest him, and\r\nbecause the flank squads at first remain behind and only gradually try\r\nto rejoin the leading skirmishers. If only a part of the skirmishers\r\nhave jumped up, it is quite natural for them not to make a long rush,\r\nbut to throw themselves down before reaching the new position, because\r\nof the feeling that they have been abandoned by their comrades and the\r\nfear of running into their field of fire. Thus, in spite of the best\r\nintentions of the leader, the short rush by small units occurs. In time\r\nof peace, however, we should retain the long rush by platoons and not\r\nendeavor to give human weaknesses the force of regulations.\r\n\r\nWhen once compelled to employ short rushes the following question\r\npresents itself: Is the advantage of such a small gain of ground worth\r\nthe trouble of inducing the soldier to rise for making an advance\r\nby rushes? Would it, therefore, not be more profitable to =crawl\r\nforward=? A man crawling on his belly presents a vulnerable surface\r\nof approximately the size of a breast plate 50 cm. high. In an advance\r\nmade by a large unit, or over covered terrain (fields of standing\r\ngrain) crawling would be difficult (difficulty of maintaining the\r\ndirection of march and reduction of the rate of advance); it would\r\nalso be difficult to get men to advance to the charge after they have\r\ncrawled along in this fashion for some time. The supervision of a unit\r\ncrawling forward would also be exceedingly difficult. The following\r\nresults were obtained in experiments made under favorable conditions:\r\nA distance of 500 m. was covered by crawling in about 10 minutes;\r\ncrawling tired the men, increased the activity of the lungs to such an\r\nextent that deliberate aiming and firing was out of the question and\r\nthe motion produced a noticeable swelling of arms, hands and knees.[89]\r\nThe Boers occasionally used the following method: One man crept forward\r\nonce or twice his own length, raising his body slightly, while the\r\nman next to him fired; then they exchanged roles and this procedure\r\nwas repeated uninterruptedly. In any case, troops ought to be able to\r\nexecute both the advance by rushes and the advance by crawling with\r\nor without firing. On terrain devoid of cover a skirmish line will\r\nfrequently be able to advance only by crawling.\r\n\r\n    [89] During the engagement at Paardeberg (18th February, 1900), the\r\n  fighting line of the British 9th Infantry Division was reinforced\r\n  by troops crawling up into the line, and carried forward to within\r\n  450 m. of the enemy’s position. An isolated assault was subsequently\r\n  repulsed by the Boers.\r\n\r\n  Procedure: The man throws himself on the ground at full length, head\r\n  resting upon the bent left arm, right hand grasping the small of\r\n  the rifle-stock. The man moves forward by alternately bending and\r\n  straightening the right leg. When the right leg is straightened the\r\n  body slides forward without rising in the least from the ground, and\r\n  the head also remains in position resting on the left arm. The head\r\n  is raised only when the man fires his piece, the butt of which is\r\n  placed against the shoulder. Crawling on all fours is very tiring,\r\n  the man offers a larger target, and, in addition, is not immediately\r\n  ready for firing.\r\n\r\n  In this manner the Boers succeeded in shooting the enemy out of\r\n  his position. The firing line, while keeping up an incessant fire,\r\n  slowly but steadily advanced. The advance of this uncanny crawling\r\n  line is said to have produced an especially disquieting and\r\n  paralyzing impression on the immovable defender, who was tied to his\r\n  position, because of his inability to inflict perceptible losses\r\n  on these small, prone targets, and because, moreover, he himself\r\n  was continually under a galling fire. As no assault was made, no\r\n  opportunity was offered the defender for using his rifles against\r\n  targets the height of a man. The British infantrymen were, however,\r\n  insufficiently trained in handling their weapons independently. As\r\n  to rise and to retreat meant annihilation, the determination to\r\n  resist weakened gradually during the long fire fight, and, in order\r\n  to escape from this seemingly unendurable situation, which grew\r\n  more and more acute with every minute, and which paralyzed every\r\n  energetic decision, one avenue of escape only seemed open, that of\r\n  surrender.[90]\r\n\r\n    [90] Engagement at Nicholson’s Neck, October 29th, 1900.\r\n  _Vierteljahrshefte_, 1905, pp. 145 and 149.\r\n\r\n  One who fought on the Boer side writes as follows: “After we had\r\n  crept up, in this manner, constantly firing and crawling, to within\r\n  about 300 m. of the enemy, we saw many white handkerchiefs waving\r\n  over in his lines, as a signal of surrender. As we placed little\r\n  credence in these signs of surrender, however, on account of many a\r\n  bad experience, we continued the advance by crawling. But, as soon as\r\n  we saw that most of the men in the enemy’s ranks were throwing away\r\n  their weapons, we rose to make the British prisoners. When we came up\r\n  with them, I noticed that a great many of the men were weeping like\r\n  children. Later, when I voiced my astonishment over the morale of\r\n  their troops to some English officers, they stated that it was due to\r\n  the uncanny manner of our advance.\r\n\r\n  “These officers stated, moreover, that the sight of danger\r\n  approaching ever closer without their being able to ward it off\r\n  effectively, caused great depression and alarm among their troops;\r\n  for the Boers, utilizing every available rock in crawling over the\r\n  plain, presented such an unfavorable target that the British fire had\r\n  had very little effect, while they themselves had been constantly\r\n  exposed to the Boer fire. All this, they claimed, had contributed to\r\n  unnerve their troops.”[91]\r\n\r\n    [91] _Supplement No. 8 to Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1900. _Spionskop_,\r\n  in _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 34/35, p. 59.\r\n\r\n=Lessons of the Boer War=: “The rushes * * * were of variable length,\r\naccording to the intensity of the hostile fire; they varied from 30\r\nto 80 m. According to the opinion of many British officers it was\r\nexceedingly difficult to induce skirmishers to rise and rush forward\r\nunder hostile fire; but that once upon their feet, it became necessary\r\nto push the attack forward as far as possible regardless of the\r\nincreased losses entailed by the longer rushes.”[92]\r\n\r\n    [92] _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 33, p. 69.\r\n\r\nOne who fought on the Boer side reports as follows in regard to the\r\nBritish advance by rushes: “The men rose gradually and hesitatingly.\r\nThis gave the attentively watching enemy time to pour a well directed\r\nfire upon the last men who arose. Thus even short rushes made by long\r\nlines became generally too costly to be executed. Smaller groups,\r\non the other hand, were able to move with startling rapidity. * * *\r\nEvery sudden interruption of the firing that might attract the enemy’s\r\nattention should therefore be carefully avoided, but, as a rule, this\r\nis possible only when the advancing units are small.”\r\n\r\nThe British Regulations of 1896 prescribe rushes of 30-40 m., and those\r\npublished immediately after the war (1902) prescribe rushes of 70-90\r\nm., but the rush is to continue only while the surprise of the enemy\r\nlasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nRusso-Japanese War.\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese army, the 5th Infantry Division employed short, and\r\nvery short, rushes by preference, while other divisions of the 1st Army\r\nas a rule preferred long rushes. From an English work we obtain the\r\nfollowing data in regard to the length of rushes and the expenditure\r\nof ammunition per rifle during halts between consecutive rushes in the\r\nengagement on the Shiliho on October 12th, 1904, at ranges beginning\r\nwith 1,000 m.\r\n\r\nFrom the table it appears that after gaining the superiority of fire,\r\nbeginning with the fifth rush, at about 625 m. from the enemy, the\r\nlength of the rushes increased; the last 400 m. were covered in one\r\nrush as the enemy withdrew from his position.\r\n\r\n  1st rush  132 m., about 30 rounds of ammunition per rifle\r\n  2nd  „     58 „     „   15   „     „     „       „    „\r\n  3rd  „     63 „     „   15   „     „     „       „    „\r\n  4th  „     61 „     „   15   „     „     „       „    „\r\n  5th  „     75 „     „   15   „     „     „       „    „\r\n  6th  „    151 „     „    5   „     „     „       „    „\r\n  7th  „    400 „\r\n            -----------------------------------------------\r\n            940 m., about 95 rounds of ammunition per rifle\r\n\r\nIf we assume that three shots per minute were fired from each rifle, it\r\nfollows that the attack consumed approximately 40-45 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisions of the Various Regulations Relative to the Advance by Rushes.\r\n\r\n  =Germany.= (Pars. 188, 189 and 337 I. D. R.). To advance by rushes,\r\n  the following commands are given: (Such) =Platoon (section, squad)\r\n  Rush!... Rise!... March! March!= At the command =Rush!= the\r\n  skirmishers finish loading, lock pieces, close cartridge boxes, and\r\n  prepare to rise. Skirmishers lying prone take the piece in the left\r\n  hand, lean on the right, and draw the right knee as close to the body\r\n  as possible without thereby raising the body from the ground. After\r\n  a brief pause, during which these preparations are made, the platoon\r\n  commander jumps up and at the same time commands: =Rise!... March!\r\n  March!= At this command the skirmishers jump up and rush forward. The\r\n  length of the rush will rarely exceed 80 m. (Par. 337 German I. D.\r\n  R.). While rushes should, as a rule, be as long as possible, short\r\n  rushes, which are designed to leave the enemy no time for firing,\r\n  should also be practiced. The principal thing is that skirmishers\r\n  rise promptly and simultaneously and that they rush forward rapidly.\r\n  The rush is terminated by the command “_Position_”; the sight\r\n  setting is changed when necessary and fire opened without further\r\n  preliminaries. Frequently the new firing position may be indicated\r\n  before the rush is made.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= Rushes are as a rule made by platoons. “The length of the\r\n  rushes depends upon the character of the ground and the tactical\r\n  situation, as well as upon the physical condition of the men. They\r\n  serve as an expedient for reaching the next firing position.”\r\n\r\n  =France.= Rushes are made, without fixed rules, from cover to cover\r\n  (_par bonds successifs_).\r\n\r\n  =England.= (Regulations dated 1896): Originally the regulations\r\n  prescribed rushes 30-40 m. long, but, as a matter of fact, their\r\n  length was actually increased to 60 and 100 m. during the first\r\n  engagements of the South African war, in cases where the fire of the\r\n  enemy was not especially heavy. The regulations of 1905, recently\r\n  published, state: “Rushes over open ground should not exceed 80-100\r\n  yards (_i.e._, 70-90 m.) and will, in fact, rarely reach this length.\r\n  At decisive ranges, _i.e._, under 540 m., they should be short enough\r\n  to afford the enemy no opportunity to pour a well-directed fire on\r\n  the skirmishers. When cover is available the advance is made from\r\n  cover to cover.” At another place the regulations state: “On open\r\n  ground and within effective range, long lines of skirmishers, rising\r\n  simultaneously, will suffer heavy losses even when making short\r\n  rushes; the sudden movement of smaller units may take the enemy\r\n  unawares, so that for a time at least well aimed fire is avoided. The\r\n  rush is continued only while the surprise of the enemy lasts. The\r\n  shorter the range, the smaller the advancing units will have to be,\r\n  and the shorter the length of the rushes.”\r\n\r\n  All preparations for a rush must be made as unostentatiously as\r\n  possible. The units following in rear should, whenever possible,\r\n  advance beyond the leading unit which is lying down and firing. When\r\n  an advance by rushes in units is impossible, individuals may run or\r\n  crawl forward.\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= Long rushes, at least with platoons, otherwise with\r\n  companies, are used as a rule, so long as the hostile fire permits.\r\n  When the intensity of the hostile fire increases, or after the\r\n  organizations have become mixed, rushes can no longer be made by\r\n  entire units but only by squads or like fractions. These leave the\r\n  main line and endeavor to reach the next cover at a rapid run, or if\r\n  cover be lacking, throw themselves down in order to open fire again\r\n  at the shorter range thus gained. As a rule, the leading echelons\r\n  open fire at once from their new positions so as to facilitate the\r\n  advance of the others, unless special circumstances make it advisable\r\n  to delay the firing until all the other units have reached a good\r\n  position and are able to direct an effective fire upon the enemy.\r\n\r\n  =Japan.= Rushes are made according to German pattern, their maximum\r\n  length being 100, their minimum 30-40 m. Rushes are not made by units\r\n  smaller than a platoon.\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= Rushes are made by individual men, by groups, by sections,\r\n  and by platoons. The length of the rushes is not indicated. When\r\n  sections advance by rushes the platoon commander indicates the\r\n  section which is to advance first, and also the order in which the\r\n  others are to follow. The Russian regulations are the only ones which\r\n  prescribe a “movement to the rear by rushes,” at a run.\r\n\r\nFrequently, when the men are very much fatigued, when advancing over\r\nplowed ground and through extensive grain fields, an advance by rushes\r\nwill be impossible. Whether =fire while in motion= ought to be\r\nemployed in this case should be determined. A preliminary condition\r\nfor its employment is, however, that the enemy’s fire has been subdued\r\nor that he has been forced under cover. To advance against an unshaken\r\nenemy with fire while in motion must lead to the annihilation of the\r\nattacking force. While the defender scores only 12.8% hits against\r\nadvancing skirmishers at 700 m., the attacker scores only 1.6% to 3.5%\r\nhits against head and breast targets. With such a discrepancy in fire\r\neffect, the attack, if employing fire while in motion, is bound to\r\ncollapse, unless it has already gained a superiority of fire prior to\r\nthe advance. It is unfortunate that fire while in motion is frequently\r\nemployed when inappropriate during drills. The danger of men wounding\r\neach other and of the advance hesitating because the officers are not\r\nin front of the line is not to be underestimated. On the other hand,\r\nthe advantages of eliminating the difficulties of inducing the men to\r\nrise, of the troops leaving their losses behind, of stragglers being\r\nmore easily detected, and of keeping the entire hostile line under\r\nfire, cannot be denied. In war this method of advance will frequently\r\nresult without orders while advancing to the charge after the defender\r\nhas been driven under cover. (In Russia this mode of advance is\r\nprescribed).\r\n\r\n  During experiments in field firing, held in Austria by a force\r\n  advancing from 1,400 to 600 paces, with an expenditure of an equal\r\n  number of rounds of ammunition in each experiment, the following\r\n  results were obtained:\r\n\r\n      Regulation attack:             Fire while in motion:\r\n  Time         26 min. 28 seconds      18 min. 40 seconds\r\n  Fire pauses  12  „   18   „           7  „   40   „\r\n\r\n                  Attacker against the defender:\r\n  Percentage of hits     7                 16.7\r\n                  Defender against the attacker:\r\n  Percentage of hits     9.2               33.\r\n\r\n  Percentage of hits obtained during the execution of the attack from\r\n  1,400 to 100 paces:\r\n\r\n  Attacker              22.7               20.\r\n  Defender              32.2               51.2\r\n\r\nThere is no model advance within the zone of effective infantry fire.\r\nAll expedients, whether they be sneaking or crawling, long or short\r\nrushes, or fire while in motion, are of equal value, if the force, kept\r\nwell in hand by the leader, is thereby brought closer to the enemy.\r\nEvery opportunity to gain a foot of ground to the front, offered by\r\nflanking fire or fire directed at the enemy over the heads of the\r\nadvancing force, must be utilized. The effect of our own artillery\r\nfire should also be attentively followed with a view to advancing when\r\nthe hostile skirmishers have sought refuge under cover to escape our\r\nshrapnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of the Employment of Fire While in Motion.\r\n\r\n  The successful attack made by the 1st Turco Regiment at =Wörth=.[93]\r\n\r\n    [93] V. BOGUSLAWSKI, _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 50_, p. 212.\r\n\r\n  This attack was made against disordered and exhausted troops which\r\n  lacked officers and reserves.

SCHLICHTING, _Taktische und strategische Grundsätze_, 1, p.\r\n  71.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of the Employment of Rushes.\r\n\r\n  1. Attack on =Le Bourget=, on October 30th, 1870.[96]\r\n\r\n    [96] HOHENLOHE, _Briefe über Infanterie_, p. 80.\r\n\r\n    KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 10, p. 43.\r\n\r\n  Two battalions of the _Kaiser Franz_ Guard Grenadier Regiment had\r\n  to advance from Dugny against the enemy in the northwest edge of Le\r\n  Bourget over 1,500 m. of very open terrain, covered only with high\r\n  potato crops. The battalions were formed in two lines with two\r\n  companies entirely deployed in the first line, and the battalion\r\n  reserves in rear of the center of the line with files at extended\r\n  intervals. The second line was formed similarly. The two companies\r\n  in the firing line advanced at first without firing, by rushes of\r\n  about 300 m. each, made by alternate companies, each moving forward\r\n  beyond the point where the other had halted. When effective range\r\n  was reached one company opened rapid fire while the other moved\r\n  forward by long rushes. The companies in rear followed in a similar\r\n  manner. The tall potato bushes partly concealed the lines while lying\r\n  down. In this manner the two battalions reached the outskirts of the\r\n  village almost without being checked, the defender having withdrawn\r\n  to the interior of the village.\r\n\r\n  The losses of the two battalions, while advancing by rushes, were\r\n  insignificant.\r\n\r\n  The regimental commander, bearing in mind the lessons gained at St.\r\n  Privat, had drilled the regiment beforehand in this mode of attack.\r\n\r\n  2. Attack on Redout No. 2, at =Scheinovo=, on January 9th, 1878.\r\n\r\n  The attack by Skobeleff’s Division, consisting of four battalions\r\n  (_Drushines_) of Bulgarians, and the _Ugla_, _Vladimir_, and _Kasan_\r\n  Regiments, was to be made under cover of the fire of two rifle\r\n  battalions armed with Berdan rifles, and of a provisional battalion\r\n  of the _Ugla_ Regiment armed with captured Turkish rifles. The only\r\n  artillery available consisted of a mountain battery, while the Turks\r\n  were able to bring twenty guns into action.\r\n\r\n  The Turkish rifle fire began at about 1,000-1,200 m., but the Russian\r\n  firing lines continued the advance with shouldered arms. Only when\r\n  the losses increased noticeably did they advance by rushes, _without\r\n  firing_, from 750 to about 500 m. where they opened fire. The rushes\r\n  were made by the entire firing line; the supports, with files at\r\n  extended intervals, did not follow until the firing line had thrown\r\n  itself down.\r\n\r\n  After the firing had lasted for some time, the Ugla Regiment, from\r\n  the reserve, was formed in three lines, each consisting of one\r\n  battalion, each battalion again into two lines with 350 m. distance\r\n  between lines (total depth of the column about 1,800 m.). From 900\r\n  m. on, the advance was made by rushes, the entire force inclining\r\n  to the right front. While covered by the fire of the skirmishers of\r\n  the firing line in front, the length of the rushes was 100-150 m.\r\n  At 250 m. from the enemy, the leading line, extending the line of\r\n  the Bulgarian and Rifle Battalions, was able to open fire and, after\r\n  about thirty minutes, when it was clearly apparent that the Turks\r\n  were evacuating the work, the regiment began the assault, which was\r\n  successful.\r\n\r\n  Of the troops in the first line, the 11th Rifle Battalion lost 11\r\n  officers and 422 men; the 9th Rifle Battalion, 5 officers and 269\r\n  men; the original strength of each being about 800 men. Expenditure\r\n  of ammunition: 11th Rifle Battalion, 120 rounds per rifle.\r\n\r\n  The Ugla Regiment, which advanced in close order after the defender’s\r\n  fire had been silenced, lost only nine officers and 391 men. The\r\n  Kasan Regiment, which followed the Ugla Regiment, participated in the\r\n  assault on the second Turkish position. The Turkish fire had abated\r\n  to such an extent that the battalions were able to advance in rear of\r\n  one another, each in two lines with distances of only 35 m. between\r\n  lines; the intervals between companies were 15 m., and those between\r\n  files were extended. Losses: four officers and 76 men. Expenditure of\r\n  ammunition: 12 rounds per rifle.[97]\r\n\r\n    [97] KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den\r\n  Russich-Türkischen Krieg_, III, pp. 168-186.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with these examples of long rushes, almost every obstinate\r\nengagement with an unshaken enemy showed that “every step forward”\r\nhad to be literally gained by the impulse imparted by the arrival of\r\nsmall, fresh detachments, that the rushes often faltered after only\r\n20-30 paces, and that frequently nothing remained but to work forward\r\nindividually. (See pp. 76 and 87 _supra_.)\r\n\r\n  The frontal attacks made at =Wörth=, at the Roten Berg at\r\n  =Spicheren=, opposite =Flavigny=, on August 16th, 1870, and opposite\r\n  the gravel pits of =Point du Jour=, on August 18th, 1870, etc.\r\n\r\n  In the Russo-Turkish war, the engagement at the mills north of\r\n  =Lovtcha=, the fight for the possession of the Green Hill ridges\r\n  south of =Plevna=, and the fight during the advance from the west\r\n  and southwest against the large work of =Gorni Dubniac=, show how\r\n  rushes, repeatedly attempted at short ranges, faltered after only a\r\n  few paces. “On a signal given by Ljapunov, which was to be repeated\r\n  by all the officers, the men were to rush forward immediately. Just\r\n  before the movement began, the Turks opened the usual incessant\r\n  fire, and the simultaneous advance of so many squads was of course\r\n  absolutely impossible. The rushes were, therefore, always made by\r\n  groups of 2-3 men. These groups would rise, one in this company, one\r\n  in that, run forward a few steps, and then throw themselves down\r\n  again.”[98]\r\n\r\n    [98] PUSYREWSKI, _Die russische Garde im Kriege, 1877-78_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n  The attacks on =Railway Hill= and on =Hart’s Hill= (February 1900),\r\n  on the =Tugela=, show an endeavor to advance at first by long rushes,\r\n  then by rushes gradually diminishing in length, the infantry finally\r\n  working itself forward by twos and threes for the purpose of reaching\r\n  the last firing position from which the final assault could be\r\n  made.[99]\r\n\r\n    [99] _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 34/35, pp. 129, 139.\r\n  _The Times History of the War in South Africa_, III, p. 539.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) Reinforcing the Firing Line.\r\n\r\nIf the fire power of the firing line is to be maintained after heavy\r\nlosses, or the intensity of its fire is to be augmented, or when it\r\nfinally is to receive the impulse for making a further advance, it\r\nmust be reinforced. (Pars. 226, 227 and 341 German I. D. R.). This\r\nmay be done by prolonging the line (platoons abreast at well defined\r\nintervals), or, when space is lacking and after losses have occurred,\r\nby putting men in the intervals (_i.e._, increasing the density of the\r\nline and filling it up). When the firing line is prolonged, tactical\r\nunits are not broken up, and this facilitates fire control. Whenever\r\npracticable, the firing line should be reinforced by prolonging it,\r\nalthough the other method, that of placing men in the intervals and\r\ngaps of the firing line, is more frequently used and more practical\r\nbecause the arrival of fresh men and the replacement of incapacitated\r\nofficers occasioned thereby renews the strength of the firing line\r\n(replenishment of ammunition). The breaking up of platoons is\r\nunavoidable, and on that account platoon and squad leaders should be\r\ntrained in time of peace to form new units at once so that control is\r\nnot lost. In order to prevent the mixing of units, so far as this is\r\npossible, and to keep the firing line filled up with skirmishers, even\r\nduring an engagement entailing heavy losses, it is indispensable that\r\nthe fighting front should be limited, that of a company in attack to\r\n150, in defense to about 200 m. The unit designated to reinforce the\r\nfiring line endeavors to approach that line under cover, forms skirmish\r\nline at any rate before leaving the last cover and advances by rushes,\r\nor, if directly in rear of the firing line and under a heavy fire, even\r\nby crawling.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= Both modes of reinforcing the firing line, that of\r\n  prolonging it, and that of filling the intervals and gaps, are used.\r\n  When prolonging the line the reinforcement may remain abreast of the\r\n  firing line. During an attack efforts should, however, be made to\r\n  advance beyond the firing line--“to overreach it.” The other method,\r\n  that of filling up the line, is in attack, as a rule, to be used for\r\n  the purpose of carrying the line forward, the rush to be made as soon\r\n  as the reinforcement reaches the firing line. Signals are prescribed\r\n  for prolonging the line without advancing beyond it, for reinforcing\r\n  that line and advancing beyond it, and for filling it up and carrying\r\n  it forward in a rush.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) Closing Up. Assembling. Re-Forming.\r\n\r\n(Pars. 211-214 and 230-232 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThe most effective method of preventing a mixing of organizations in\r\naction is for all units constantly to endeavor to close in toward their\r\nleaders, filling gaps as soon as casualties have occurred. Squads which\r\nhave sustained heavy losses unite with adjoining ones under a common\r\nleader. This closing in can, as a rule, be executed only while in\r\nmotion. It must be effected gradually and the intervals ordered should\r\nbe maintained. Crowding of every description increases losses and\r\ncauses dangerous gaps along the entire front.\r\n\r\nIf in the course of an engagement, the purpose of the action and the\r\nsituation make it no longer desirable to retain an extended order\r\nformation, each leader, from the squad leader upward, must assemble his\r\nunit at once and place himself and it at the disposal of the commander\r\nof the next higher unit. Formed bodies must be created quickly and held\r\nwell in hand by their leaders, without awaiting specific orders to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe troops must be assembled very quietly and always facing the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe original organizations are not re-formed until the command “Fall\r\nin” is given. (Pars. 214 and 232 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n\r\n10. SUPPORTS.\r\n\r\n(Pars. 222-228 and 341 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThe limited front assigned to an organization necessitates, in the\r\nfirst place, a division into firing line and retained fractions. At the\r\ndecisive stage of a fight every available man must, without question,\r\nbe in the first line.\r\n\r\nItaly. Supports are not to be used when they cannot be maintained at a\r\nless distance from the firing line than that separating the latter from\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of supports to reinforce and extend the firing line, to\r\ncover the flanks (par. 222 German I. D. R.), to act as a reserve, and,\r\nin case of necessity, as a rallying force upon which the firing line\r\ncan fall back. The presence of supports increases confidence in attack,\r\nand the power of resistance in defense. Supports enable a leader to\r\ninfluence the action, to give a firing line that has been checked the\r\nimpetus necessary to carry it forward, and to affect the action by\r\nsending reinforcements to points where he wishes to gain an advantage.\r\nThe support follows that part of the firing line which, in all\r\nprobability, will need its assistance; if part of the same organization\r\nas the firing line, it follows in rear of the center, otherwise in\r\nrear of a wing. In a company advancing alone over covered terrain, it\r\nwill sometimes be necessary to place small supports in rear of both\r\nflanks. Firing lines can perhaps advance for some time under hostile\r\nfire, whether they move by twos, by squads, or by platoons, but the\r\npower necessary for pushing home the attack must be imparted to them\r\nfrom the rear; otherwise the energy of the attack will spend itself.\r\nThe necessity of having supports in rear of the firing line is clearly\r\nillustrated in the very instructive engagement at Wagon Hill in front\r\nof Ladysmith (6th January 1900). In this fight all attempts to push the\r\nfiring line forward failed, and the necessary impetus for the decisive\r\nadvance was not given until fresh supports were fed into the firing\r\nline.[100]\r\n\r\n    [100] _The Times History of the War in South Africa_, III, p. 200.\r\n\r\nIn hilly country the supports can fire over the heads of the\r\nskirmishers in front of them without neglecting their proper functions.\r\n(Switzerland and England). Such opportunities should not be overlooked,\r\nas they increase the volume of fire.\r\n\r\nDistances depend upon the object to be attained by the action and upon\r\nthe terrain.\r\n\r\nWhen a decision is sought, distances should be decreased in the course\r\nof the action. When this is the case, the leaders of all grades should\r\nbe animated by but one desire, that of being in front in order to\r\nparticipate in gaining the victory. The duration of the crisis of an\r\naction is usually brief, and in a very few rapidly passing moments the\r\nleader must decide what to do with the troops remaining available.\r\n\r\nWhen an immediate decision is not sought, it is advisable to increase\r\ndistances in order to keep the echelons held back in rear from coming\r\nunder fire. In any case, the distance between supports and firing line\r\nshould be less than the distance between firing line and enemy. In an\r\nattack, supports should be close enough to the firing line to prevent,\r\nby timely interference, a retrograde movement of the latter. On the\r\ndefensive, on account of the difficulty of bringing up supports for the\r\npurpose of repulsing an assault, they will usually be placed a short\r\ndistance immediately in rear of or within the firing line (intrenched)\r\nat the points where they are to be employed.\r\n\r\nDuring an attack, whenever the lines in rear cannot be kept out of\r\nhostile fire, care must nevertheless be taken that two echelons be not\r\nsimultaneously struck by a cone of infantry fire or by one and the same\r\nshrapnel. The distance between echelons is therefore increased to more\r\nthan 300 m., and should not be reduced until the decisive stage of the\r\ncombat approaches.\r\n\r\nIn open country, supports held too close to the firing line will soon\r\ncease to exist as such. When kept in close order, their losses would\r\nbe so great that the boldest men would join the firing line and the\r\nless courageous would hunt cover. Everything depends upon the manner\r\nin which supports are led forward, especially during that part of the\r\nadvance immediately preceding their junction with the firing line. In\r\nthis lies the whole art of fighting in deep formations. Covered terrain\r\npermits distances to be reduced. The commander should be particularly\r\ncareful not to let this advantage escape him, since on such terrain it\r\nis more frequently necessary promptly to reinforce the firing line.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the support must constantly observe the movements and\r\nsuccesses of the firing line in order that he may be able to reinforce\r\nit in the most advantageous manner. Whenever he is obliged to split\r\nup his command during a movement to the front, he should endeavor to\r\nreunite it at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe support should closely adapt its movements to those of the firing\r\nline. When a part of the firing line makes a rush, the support halts\r\nfor the moment, and then runs forward to the next cover, simultaneously\r\nwith the next advancing unit of the firing line, and covered by the\r\nfire of the skirmishers in front. “To make a rush at the same time as\r\nthe firing line was impossible, because, as soon as the latter rose,\r\nthe Turks opened a murderous fire. Whenever the firing line threw\r\nitself down and returned the fire, that of the enemy became noticeably\r\nweaker.”[101]\r\n\r\n    [101] _Report of Lieutenant Borsov_, in KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER,\r\n  _Kritische Rückblicke auf den Russisch-Türkischen Krieg_, III, p. 183.\r\n\r\nThe supports follow the firing line in single or double rank, in column\r\nof twos or squads, in skirmish line or in line of squads, in quick time\r\nor by rushes; it may also be advisable to deviate temporarily from the\r\ndirection of advance. Columns having a narrow front, so long as they\r\nare not open to attack from a flank, are able to withstand long range\r\ninfantry fire. (Par. 224 German I. D. R.). On coming to a halt, it is\r\nadvisable to return to close order formation; at any rate, the leader\r\nmust get his command again entirely under control.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupports in Rear of the Firing Line or Not?\r\n\r\nUp to a few years ago (1894), the French battalion was divided into\r\nfiring line and companies of the second line. The Japanese, also, often\r\nplaced entire companies in the firing line, which could not be quickly\r\nenough reinforced by the companies of the second line, because these\r\nwere held too far in rear. At any rate, supports are of advantage\r\nduring the first deployment before the situation is clear.\r\n\r\nThe following arguments are advanced against the employment of supports:\r\n\r\n1. _The supports following the firing line suffer losses, without, as\r\na rule, being able to participate in the action._ This argument is not\r\nwell founded, since the criticism made with reference to supports is\r\nequally applicable to companies in the second line. That supports threw\r\nthemselves into the firing line in the Franco-German war, in the belief\r\nthat they were needlessly suffering losses, was due to the fact that\r\nthey followed the firing line too closely.\r\n\r\nSupports following the firing line closely (250-300 m.) can reach the\r\nfiring line quickly and can easily find cover on account of the small\r\nangle of fall of modern bullets. Besides, the knowledge that supports\r\nare immediately in rear, the moral factor, should not be underestimated.\r\n\r\n2. _The supports may be commanded by inexperienced leaders, who will\r\nnot always act with the good judgment the situation demands and will\r\nfail to seize the right moment for advancing._ (This can perhaps never\r\nbe avoided).\r\n\r\n3. _Pushing the supports into the firing line tends to mix units,\r\nmakes control more difficult, and impairs the efficacy of fire._ These\r\ncriticisms are not applicable to a company, for it is in any case\r\nimpossible for the company commander to control the fire; this is the\r\nbusiness of platoon commanders.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of supports are, that they increase the number of\r\ntargets offered the hostile artillery; that, by reason of their small\r\nsize, they can utilize every accident of the ground; that they can\r\nbe kept close enough to the firing line to reinforce it in case of\r\nsudden emergency; and that they allow companies in the second line to\r\nbe kept farther to the rear. A battalion, when part of a larger force,\r\nneed not keep formed bodies as supports; but a few platoons, following\r\nthe firing line in close order on the flanks, are an advantage. The\r\ndrawbacks of the _petits paquets_ would appear only if every company\r\nwere to preserve a support up to the decisive stage of the action.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. COMPARISON BETWEEN CLOSE AND EXTENDED ORDER.\r\n\r\nIn =close order= the men are placed so close together that they can be\r\nled by word of command and directly influenced by their officers. The\r\nposition of the individual soldier is fixed; the men on either side of\r\nhim interfere with his utilizing cover or his weapon. On terrain devoid\r\nof cover, close order formations present such large targets to infantry\r\nfire, that their employment, when exposed to the unsubdued fire of the\r\nenemy, is impossible and must lead to annihilation. Thus the hostile\r\nfire compels the most extended deployment.[102]\r\n\r\n    [102] Even during the Franco-German war it was impossible to employ\r\n  close order formations in the first line, when opposed by an unshaken\r\n  enemy, although this was still prescribed by the regulations.\r\n  Whenever this was attempted tremendous losses resulted. In the battle\r\n  of Vionville the 5th and 8th Companies of the 35th Füsilier-Regiment,\r\n  formed into a half-battalion, and following the other companies of\r\n  the battalion, which were pushed forward as the first line, suffered\r\n  in five minutes a loss of 9 officers and 150 men (out of a total of\r\n  about 400 men) from infantry fire at 1000 to 1200 m. “The impression\r\n  produced was so overpowering that the commands for extending and\r\n  deploying could not be executed at all and that the half-battalion\r\n  had to be withdrawn in rear of the cemetery where it was assembled by\r\n  the three officers still remaining.” _Geschichte des Regiments Nr.\r\n  35_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n    In cases where troops appeared in close order each losses were not\r\n  at all exceptional.\r\n\r\n    On August 18th, 1870, the Füsilier-Battalion of the 85th Infantry,\r\n  advancing from Vernéville, at first in double column, then in\r\n  half-battalion column, to within 400 paces of the enemy, lost 12\r\n  officers, 32 non-commissioned officers, and 437 men killed and\r\n  wounded (52%) in 20 minutes by the cross-fire of hostile artillery\r\n  and mitrailleuse batteries. At 800 paces from the enemy the fragments\r\n  of the battalion were assembled in three platoons. _Gen. St. W._, II,\r\n  p. 724. _Der 18. August_, p. 152.\r\n\r\n    The success of the bayonet attack made by the 9th Company of the\r\n  29th Infantry at St. Quentin may be explained by the inferiority of\r\n  the opponent. _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 29_, p. 499.\r\n\r\nIn =extended order= the soldier’s position is not definitely fixed; he\r\nis not required to keep his body in a prescribed position, nor is he\r\nexpected to handle his rifle by the numbers as in the manual. Instead,\r\njudgment, agility, courage, confidence in himself, skill in handling\r\nhis weapon and in taking full advantage of the accidents of the ground,\r\nas well as unremitting attention to his leader, are demanded of the\r\nskirmisher.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of troop leading are, moreover, increased by the\r\nnoise and other disorganizing influences of the fight, especially\r\nin broken or wooded country. Whether an organization is thoroughly\r\ntrained and disciplined is best shown in extended order fighting, for,\r\nas the direct control of the leader on his command decreases, the\r\ndemands made on the initiative of the individual soldier increase out\r\nof all proportion. It is at any rate more practical to develop this\r\ninitiative than to try to prevent the disorganizing effect of combat by\r\nrestricting the personal freedom of the individual soldier.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep troops well in hand and to deploy them quickly in any\r\ndirection, it is requisite that close order formations be retained as\r\nlong as the terrain and the hostile fire permit. After an action, in\r\norder to make a renewed employment of the troops possible, they must\r\nbe assembled in close order without regard to the previously existing\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIn night combats, in actions against cavalry not supported by other\r\narms, in putting down rebellions, and frequently in colonial wars[103]\r\nas well, the importance of close order formations increases when the\r\ntroops show a disposition to get out of hand.\r\n\r\n    [103] The British _Infantry Training_ contains special regulations\r\n  governing “savage warfare,” in which close order battalion formations\r\n  are explicitly given the preference (order in echelon, square).\r\n\r\nIn extended order, infantry can most easily surmount obstacles, cross\r\ndifficult terrain, and take the fullest advantage of the accidents\r\nof the ground, as cover against hostile fire and as rifle rests. In\r\nextended order, infantry is, moreover, able to develop its fire power\r\nmost effectively, while at the same time offering the smallest possible\r\ntargets to the hostile projectiles. Thus the _skirmish line_ is the\r\nprincipal combat formation of infantry; by means of it a combat is\r\ninitiated and carried through to the end.\r\n\r\nClose order is best adapted for establishing discipline in the\r\nsimplest and most rapid manner by means of drill. At Jena the Prussian\r\nbattalions were not defeated because of their drill, but because they\r\nwere poorly led. What function drill had fulfilled at that time is\r\npretty well illustrated by the heavy losses sustained by the Prussian\r\ninfantry and by the fact that, although placed in a situation to which\r\nthey were entirely unaccustomed, the troops retained their steadiness.\r\nNo properly led army has been able to dispense with drill in developing\r\nits discipline. In the days of linear and column tactics the ultimate\r\nobject of training was the leading of battalions in close order, in\r\nmagnificent array, against the enemy. By means of drill a passive\r\ndiscipline was to be created in which intelligence played no part\r\nwhatever. We know with what energy the army of the First Napoleon was\r\ndrilled according to the wholly superannuated regulations of linear\r\ntactics in the camp at Boulogne and during the brief pauses between\r\ncampaigns. A well drilled organization has ever, when well led, proved\r\nequal to the occasion.[104] The electrifying word of command is an\r\nimportant factor in assisting an organization accustomed to it to\r\novercome difficult situations. No leader will voluntarily dispense with\r\nthis aid. When Austrian shells struck the company of Count Finkenstein\r\nduring the advance against the Shipwald, that officer halted his\r\ncommand, brought it to shoulder arms and did not continue the movement\r\nuntil order had been completely restored.\r\n\r\n    [104] Compare herewith _Der 18. August_, p. 463, in regard to the\r\n  importance of discipline in the execution of the attack on St. Privat.\r\n\r\nGeneral v. Blume considers drill and skirmish training two distinct\r\nmethods by means of which efficient soldiers may be created. To\r\nquote: “In this connection the most perfect results would undoubtedly\r\nbe attained by efficient drill and thorough skirmish training.”\r\nWhere both these methods cannot be coördinated, training in extended\r\norder fighting should take precedence. General v. d. Goltz raises\r\nthe objection that this might perhaps produce skirmishers, but not\r\nsoldiers, _i.e._, _men whose devotion to duty surpasses their fear of\r\ndeath_. General v. d. Goltz is right in demanding combat drill. In this\r\nterm he includes the painstaking execution of all those accomplishments\r\nwhich the skirmisher needs in action and which he should be able to use\r\ncorrectly and quickly without lengthy deliberation. To this category\r\nbelong rapid loading and setting of the sight, good pointing in any\r\nposition, accurate aiming, cool firing, quick locking of the piece,\r\nprompt jumping up for the advance, taking advantage of accidents of the\r\nground in lying down for the purpose of heightening the fire effect,\r\ncrawling forward with or without firing, etc., etc. Since all these\r\nthings must be practiced individually, and since many of them do not\r\npermit of simultaneous execution by an entire unit, we usually speak of\r\ncombat training instead of combat drill, without, however, intending\r\nany other meaning.\r\n\r\n“Drill is always mechanical. The instructor can make the skirmisher\r\nload quickly and carefully, can cause him to take the position of\r\naim, just as he drills the correct execution of present arms and the\r\nrise preparatory to advancing by rushes. Training is directed at the\r\nmentality of the man, it makes him independent and allows him to\r\nexercise initiative, even when he is no longer directly under his\r\nsuperior officers’ influence, and when, in a critical hour, he is no\r\nlonger able to follow their example.\r\n\r\n“Drill and training are both justified, each in its appropriate sphere;\r\nthe scope of both is closely defined and neither one could be dispensed\r\nwith. ‘Drill’ assists in creating the ‘soldier,’ because it develops\r\nthe characteristics which must be required of a ‘soldier’: Endurance\r\nin surmounting hardships and dangers, unquestioning subordination of\r\nhis will to that of the leader, tenacity and trustworthiness, skill\r\nin handling his weapon and in utilizing the ground. The addition of\r\ntraining will, of course, increase the value of this ‘soldier’ very\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n“Training alone will never attain this object. To arouse and develop\r\nthe man’s intellect may make him a good skirmisher, a skillful member\r\nof a patrol, but for battle he remains incomplete, since his awakened\r\nmental powers have not been made available by the disciplining drill.\r\nHis energies are not governed by a higher will. Nothing can give us the\r\nassurance that he may not fail at the most decisive moment. He is no\r\nsoldier.”[105]\r\n\r\n    [105] V. D. GOLTZ, _Zur Gefechtsausbildung_, p. 26.\r\n\r\nThe French, for reasons inherent in their character, discard this\r\ndrill and seek to replace it by developing the moral factors: “Moral\r\npowers are the mightiest pillars of success. Honor and patriotism fill\r\ntroops with the noblest devotion. The spirit of self-sacrifice and\r\nthe determination to win ensure success; discipline and steadiness\r\nguarantee the influence of the leaders and the coöperation of all the\r\nelements.”[106]\r\n\r\n    [106] _Introduction to the French Infantry Drill Regulations_.\r\n\r\n  “However, when necessity demands the creation of new\r\n  organizations--whether militia, volunteers, or _gardes mobiles_,--it\r\n  is a great mistake to expect everything from moral factors; even\r\n  though hatred of the enemy, enthusiasm for the fatherland, the\r\n  republic or for glory, rise to the highest pitch. ‘Victory or\r\n  death’ is the watchword when marching out--but neither is quickly\r\n  attainable; weeks and months of the severest hardships, exhausting\r\n  marches, wet and hungry bivouacs must first be endured. Very soon the\r\n  intoxication of enthusiasm is gone and reality weighs heavily on the\r\n  sobered men. Finally the enemy is confronted. But he is not to be\r\n  annihilated at once by a rapid assault--not at all; the advance is\r\n  made very slowly and the highest enthusiasm is given ample time to\r\n  evaporate during the many hours in which death is constantly faced.”\r\n  LAYMAN.\r\n\r\nFor enthusiasm, we would substitute faithful, unselfish performance of\r\nduty, and unquestioning subordination of the will of the individual\r\nto that of the leader. To be sure, on days of success enthusiasm will\r\nsuffice, but not when everything around us begins to waver and to\r\nyield. The importance of drill, which cannot be replaced by anything\r\nelse, does not become apparent until all enthusiasm disappears, until\r\nthe leader becomes conscious of the specter of panic which stalks by\r\nthe side of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Discipline,” says Archduke John in his well-known work _Drill or\r\nTraining_, “must not be confounded with the snappy drill of troops,\r\nand can, moreover, not be attained by means of it. The straightjacket\r\nhas never yet cured one insane person; the soul cannot be disciplined\r\nthrough the body. One must work from the inside and not from the\r\noutside. It is of little value if the outer annular rings of a tree are\r\nbeautiful and regular; it will rot and die in spite of its deceptive\r\nappearance; if its heart is not healthy, the first storm may bring it\r\ndown. The inner man must look beautiful; firmness and steadiness are\r\nneeded within; the marching tread of feet on the drill ground plain\r\nare of no moment; the beat of the heart filled with the spirit of\r\nself-sacrifice is the important factor.”\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Emperor William I. changed the title of the\r\nbrochure _Drill or Training_, written by Archduke John, to _Drill\r\nand Training_. Training necessitates a good corps of instructors and\r\na great deal of time, whereas drill will accomplish in a shorter\r\ntime results which are not so enduring. It is again presupposed that\r\nthe recruits are willing to be trained, otherwise all efforts are\r\nunavailing. The question whether the individual man can be influenced\r\nsufficiently in a two years’ service period to overcome even sentiments\r\ninimical to the state, instilled in him by friends or relatives, can\r\nonly be answered by the next war. To answer this question at the\r\npresent time would be premature; but one thing is certain: the sharp\r\nword of command, the whole influence of a well-organized body of\r\ntroops, will sweep along even the reluctant in the hour of danger.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the tactical formations which at one time constituted\r\nminor tactics has doubtlessly decreased; unfavorable formations, in\r\nso far as they increase or reduce losses, increase or restrict one’s\r\nfire effect, can be offset by the fighting efficiency of the soldier\r\nand by proper leading. The unfortunate termination of the battle of\r\nJena for the Prussian arms, as already mentioned, bears no relation\r\nto drill as such. The formations in themselves were not at fault, for\r\nlinear tactics scored the greatest successes in the Peninsular war\r\nand at Waterloo; and at the Katzbach, Prussian battalions of Borke’s\r\nBrigade in line overran the French columns. Within certain limits,\r\nnumerical inferiority and lack of fighting efficiency can be offset by\r\nleadership. But numbers and fighting efficiency will always remain the\r\ndecisive factors for success.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Spicheren was due primarily to the troops and not to\r\nleadership. This is likewise true of Wörth. The lion’s share in the\r\nvictory of Vionville is certainly due to the fighting efficiency of the\r\ngallant Brandenburgers. Finally, at St. Privat, the crisis produced\r\nby the commanders was successfully overcome only by the tenacity of\r\nthe troops, who maintained their positions for hours under the most\r\ndestructive hostile fire.\r\n\r\nIncreased demands must at present be made upon the combat training\r\nof the soldier. The combat requires enterprising, self-sacrificing,\r\ncold-blooded men who are imbued with the spirit of the reckless\r\noffensive. “The combat requires thinking leaders, _trained to rely upon\r\nthemselves_, and _skirmishers having initiative_.” (Par. 2 German I.\r\nD. R.). “Judgment, self-confidence and boldness must be aroused and\r\ncontinually developed in the young soldier.” (Par. 144 German I. D.\r\nR.). “The aim of all exercises should be to develop the soldier into\r\na self-thinking and conscientiously working skirmisher.” (Par. 158\r\nGerman I. D. R.). “All training should be directed toward producing\r\nself-reliance in leaders and in the individual skirmisher.” (Par. 251\r\nGerman I. D. R.). “The infantry must nourish the desire for taking the\r\noffensive; its actions must be guided by the one thought, _forward,\r\nat the enemy, no matter what the cost_.” (Par. 265 German I. D. R.).\r\n“The continuous desire to press forward and the endeavor to surpass\r\nall other units must animate all parts of the attacking force.” (Par.\r\n327 German I. D. R.). “It should be a point of honor with skirmishers\r\nnot to allow the supports to overtake them earlier than the moment of\r\npenetrating the enemy’s position.” (Par. 348 German I. D. R.). “Those\r\nwho fall must be left behind. These sacrifices should not lead to an\r\nabatement of the pursuit any more than the losses sustained in the\r\nprevious fight caused the renunciation of the purpose of the combat.”\r\n(Par. 424 German I. D. R.). “A commander who is ever willing to\r\nshoulder responsibility will not shrink from throwing troops into the\r\nfight _regardless of consequences_ even when the outcome of the battle\r\nis doubtful.” (Par. 304 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIf love of life and fear of death are overcome in a soldier by\r\ndiscipline, in an officer this must be brought about by a higher sense\r\nof duty and honor. On the battlefield the desire to live does not\r\nappear in a cultured person, as a rule, in its ordinary, undisguised\r\nform; it makes itself felt rather in the shape of tactical scruples,\r\nwhether the leader would be justified in leading his subordinates\r\nto certain death, whether it would not be his duty to preserve the\r\nforce entrusted to him for more important duty in the service of the\r\nfatherland, instead of sacrificing it uselessly. If, in addition, an\r\nofficer has been allowed, in time of peace, to criticise, from the\r\nstart, an order of his superior with reference to its feasibility, it\r\nmay easily happen in the stern reality of actual war that a subordinate\r\nleader, neither especially courageous nor ambitious, succumbs to the\r\nseductive whisperings of his senses on the approach of danger and sees\r\nin caution the better part of valor. It is always suspicious if troops\r\nhave become accustomed to consider insignificant losses, common to\r\ncolonial wars, accompanied by great physical exertions, as indications\r\nof good leadership.[107] Great victories are, as a rule, invariably\r\naccompanied by great losses.\r\n\r\n    [107] In this connection and in regard to the British losses in\r\n  South Africa, see my lecture: _Die Lehren des Burenkrieges_ (1904),\r\n  p. 8, et seq. The behavior of Sir Redvers Buller at Colenso and\r\n  Spionskop is interesting. See _The Times History of the War in South\r\n  Africa_, III, pp. 234, 236, 297, 318.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE POWER OF FIREARMS AND EXPEDIENTS FOR MINIMIZING LOSSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE POWER OF FIELD ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE FIELD GUN.\r\n\r\nThe field artillery of all the states that need be considered is armed\r\nwith a rapid-fire gun provided with shields and capable under peace\r\nconditions of firing as many as twenty shots per minute. Its caliber\r\nvaries from 7.5 to 8.38 cm. (Germany, 7.7; France, 7.5; Russia,\r\n7.62, and England, 8.38 cm., the last-named being an 18 pdr.). The\r\nGerman gun fires shrapnel weighing 6.85 kg. (the Russian, 6.5, and\r\nthe French 7.25 kg.) and high explosive shell of approximately the\r\nsame weight, with an initial velocity of 465 m. (the Russian 588 and\r\nthe French 530 m.). The projectiles are burst through the action of\r\ncombination fuzes (in Germany graduated to 5000, in France and Russia\r\nto 5500 m.). The projectiles have a maximum range of 8000 m., when\r\npercussion fuze is used. Canister has been replaced by shrapnel, which\r\nbursts approximately 200 m. in front of the gun when the fuze is set\r\nat zero. The German field artillery is also equipped with a light\r\nfield howitzer, cal. 10.5 cm., which fires shrapnel weighing 12.8 kg.\r\n(time fuze ranging from 300 to 5600 m.) and shell weighing 15.7 kg.\r\n(time fuze ranging from 500 to 5600 m.). The Germans use heavy field\r\nhowitzers (cal. 14.91 cm., firing shell that has an extreme range of\r\n6870 m.) in the heavy artillery of the field army. France uses the 15.5\r\ncm. Rimailho howitzer, England a 12.7 cm. howitzer and another long\r\npiece of 12 cm. caliber.\r\n\r\n=Percussion shrapnel= is used for defense at short range, and in fire\r\nfor adjustment; its effect depends upon the range and the nature of\r\nthe ground. It is effective against troops lodged in tall timber.\r\nMasks, branches of trees, etc., frequently cause the premature burst of\r\nthe projectiles.[108]\r\n\r\n    [108] Engagement of Azay (6th January, 1871). _Geschichte des\r\n  Regiments Nr. 20_. HOFFBAUER, _Deutsche Artillerie_, I, pp. 16 and\r\n  49. _Taktik_, VI, p. 42.\r\n\r\nPercussion shrapnel is effective only when bursting immediately in\r\nfront of the target (5-25 m. in front of it, depending upon the range).\r\nHowever, even in this case, the bullets often pass over low targets,\r\nsuch as skirmishers lying down, and low parapets afford sufficient\r\nprotection. An adequate effect can be obtained only when the fire is\r\ndirected on vertical targets. Soft ground, newly ploughed fields,\r\nterrain covered with snow or underbrush, small folds of the ground,\r\nor a rising slope, diminish the fire effect. When the angle of fall\r\nis 10 degrees or more (with the German piece at ranges of 3300 m. and\r\nover) half of the bullets penetrate the ground, the remainder ricochet\r\nand pass on at a greatly reduced velocity. The explosive or incendiary\r\neffect of shrapnel is insignificant owing to the smallness of the\r\nbursting charge. However, some incendiary effect is possible if the\r\nprojectile strikes an easily inflammable target.[109]\r\n\r\n    [109] Consult _Taktik_, VI, p. 45, in regard to the incendiary\r\n  effect of projectiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Percussion Shrapnel.]\r\n\r\n=Time shrapnel= (used in Germany up to 5000 m.) is fairly independent\r\nof the terrain, the burst being easily observed since the bullets are\r\nembedded in a “smoke-producing composition.” The extreme range at which\r\nthis projectile can be employed is fixed by the facility of observing\r\nthe fire and by the remaining velocity of the shrapnel bullets, both of\r\nwhich diminish as the range increases. Field guns, model ’96, may be\r\neffectively employed up to a range of 4000 m.; under 3000 m. their fire\r\nis so annihilating that decisive results are produced in a short time.\r\n(Par. 630 German F. S. R.). The use of the combination fuze, on account\r\nof its certainty of burst, either by time or percussion, permits\r\nthe trajectory to be accurately determined in every case. This fuze\r\nalso makes it possible to employ shrapnel against rapidly advancing\r\ntargets, and in warding off a sudden attack at short range. The French\r\nRegulations give the width of the beaten zone of a single shrapnel\r\nas 20, that of two from the same piece as 25 m. The maximum depth of\r\nthe beaten zone is 300 m. The angle of the cone of dispersion of the\r\nGerman shrapnel, model ’96, is 16 degrees at 2000 m. German shrapnel\r\n(model ’91) fired at a line of infantry did not strike lines following\r\n250 m. in rear of the first, whereas in case of base charge shrapnel\r\nthese lines would be safe only at 350-400 m. from the first line. The\r\nGerman shrapnel gives very good results when set to burst 30 to 150 m.\r\nin front of the target, the height of burst being regulated accordingly\r\n(approximately ¹⁄₃ of the whole number of hundreds of meters of the\r\nrange). At ranges under 1500 m., an adequate fire effect may, however,\r\nbe expected even when the fuze is set to burst the projectile 300 m. in\r\nfront of the target. (Par. 30 German F. A. F. R.).\r\n\r\nShrapnel is most effective against skirmishers lying down from 1000 to\r\n3000 m. when burst 28 to 22 m. short, and against standing skirmishers\r\nat the same ranges when burst 56 to 45 m. short. The two tables given\r\nbelow, borrowed from the work of Lieutenant-General Rohne on artillery\r\ntactics,[110] give an idea of the effect of a single time shrapnel,\r\nand of the effect per minute of shrapnel fire after adjusting upon the\r\ntarget:\r\n\r\n  ======================+=======================================\r\n                        |When firing at the targets named (1\r\n                        |skirmisher per m.) with time shrapnel,\r\n        TARGETS.        |mod. ’96, set to burst 50 m. short, the\r\n                        |following _hits per shrapnel_ may be\r\n                        |expected after the adjustment has been\r\n                        |effected:\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                        | 500 m.|1000 m.|2000 m.|3000 m.|4000 m.\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Skirmishers standing  |  18.4 |  14.2 |  12.0 |  11.0 |  10.4\r\n  Skirmishers kneeling  |  10.6 |   8.2 |   6.9 |   6.3 |   5.8\r\n  Skirmishers lying down|   6.4 |   4.9 |   4.1 |   3.8 |   3.5\r\n  Head targets          |   3.5 |   2.7 |   2.3 |   2.1 |   1.9\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n  ======================+=======================================\r\n                        |When firing at the targets named\r\n        TARGETS.        |(skirmish line with 1 skirmisher per\r\n                        |m.), under service conditions, with time\r\n                        |shrapnel, mod. ’96, set to burst 50-100\r\n                        |m. short, the following hits per minute\r\n                        |may be expected on an average:\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                        | 500 m.|1000 m.|2000 m.|3000 m.|4000 m.\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Skirmishers standing  |  364  |  202  |  109  |  46   |   14\r\n  Skirmishers kneeling  |  210  |  117  |   63  |  27   |    8\r\n  Skirmishers lying down|  126  |   70  |   38  |  16   |    5\r\n  Head targets          |   70  |   39  |   21  |   9   |    3\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n    [110] ROHNE, _Die Taktik der Feldartillerie_, Berlin, 2nd Edition,\r\n  p. 9.\r\n\r\nMore than 80% of the men struck by fragments and bullets from shrapnel\r\nbursting within 100 m. are disabled. The penetration of shrapnel\r\nbullets is so great, at ranges under 2000 m., that when they strike\r\nbones or vital organs of horses, they produce instant incapacity for\r\naction. This is especially true when the interval of burst is less than\r\n100 m. The effect of shrapnel directed against batteries provided with\r\nshields is insignificant. Time shrapnel is the principal projectile\r\nemployed by artillery against animate objects, provided these are not\r\nlocated immediately in rear of parapets, within tall timber, or under\r\nbomb-proofs. This projectile is ineffective against such cover on\r\naccount of the flatness of the trajectory and the sensitiveness of the\r\nfuze.\r\n\r\nShrapnel is to be supplemented by =shell= filled with explosive charge,\r\nmodel ’88, which has a great explosive effect at extreme ranges and in\r\ntall timber. (See pars. 159-160 German F. A. F. R., in regard to action\r\nagainst shielded batteries).\r\n\r\n  Percussion shell, on account of its very sensitive fuze, bursts on\r\n  penetrating the shield, while percussion shrapnel goes entirely\r\n  through the shield and bursts about ¹⁄₂ m. in rear of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Percussion Shell, Model ’96.]\r\n\r\nTargets located immediately in rear of parapets or under light splinter\r\nproofs may be reached with time shell burst directly over or close\r\nin front of them. The depth of the beaten zone of this projectile is\r\nsmall, seldom exceeding 50 m., even when the fire is directed against\r\ntargets in the open. About 75% of all the fragments are capable of\r\ninflicting disabling wounds when the interval of burst is short. The\r\npeculiar character of the projectile necessitates a very careful\r\nadjustment in range and in height of burst. The French _obus allongé_,\r\na high explosive percussion shell (melinite charge; angle of the cone\r\nof dispersion exceeds 100 degrees) is employed only for the destruction\r\nof material objects.[111]\r\n\r\n    [111] When firing on animate objects, the beaten zone of this\r\n  projectile does not exceed a space 50 m. wide and 20 m. deep, but the\r\n  concussion of the explosion will undoubtedly be felt at a greater\r\n  distance. The explosive effect of the projectile is equivalent to\r\n  that of 30 kg. of powder. The explosion of the projectile produces a\r\n  cone-shaped crater having a diameter of 2 and a depth of 0.50 m. Ten\r\n  melinite shells per running meter are required to destroy a parapet 3\r\n  m. thick and 2.30 m. high.\r\n\r\nThe French projectile, on account of the fuze used, bursts only after\r\nit has pierced thin walls or shields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Time Shell, Model ’96.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE LIGHT FIELD HOWITZER.\r\n\r\nThe realization that the power of resistance of a defender lodged in\r\ndeep trenches, could not be broken by the fire of guns having a flat\r\ntrajectory, led to the re-adoption of a gun capable of high angle fire,\r\nwhich had been eliminated from the field artillery upon the advent of\r\nrifled cannon.[112]\r\n\r\n    [112] After March, 1859, the artillery of a mobilized Prussian\r\n  army corps consisted of three horse batteries, each armed with six\r\n  6-pounder guns and two 7-pounder howitzers; six foot batteries, each\r\n  armed with eight 12-pounder guns; and three foot batteries, each\r\n  armed with eight 7-pounder howitzers. Thus the artillery of an army\r\n  corps numbered 30 howitzers and 66 guns.\r\n\r\nFor both flat trajectory and high angle fire, the light field howitzer,\r\nmodel ’98, employs shrapnel weighing 12.8 kg. (500 jacketed bullets, @\r\n10 g.; time fuze graduated from 300 to 5600 m.) and shell weighing 15.7\r\nkg. (0.37 kg. explosive charge, model ’88; time fuze graduated from 500\r\nto 5600 m.). As delay action fuzes are used, it is possible to utilize\r\nto the fullest extent the power of penetration of the projectile before\r\nit bursts.\r\n\r\nA single shrapnel from a light field howitzer produces a greater number\r\nof hits, when the point of burst is favorably situated, than one fired\r\nfrom a field gun. However, the projectiles fired from the latter have a\r\ndeeper beaten zone on account of the flatter trajectory of the piece,\r\nand a greater penetration owing to their greater remaining velocity.\r\nThe German Artillery Firing Regulations (par. 30) consider the effect\r\nof both projectiles “very good” and of equal value at the principal\r\nranges, when burst at a moderate distance (30 to 150 m.) from the\r\ntarget. The effect of shrapnel from the field gun and from the light\r\nfield howitzer is considered adequate at ranges under 1500 m., when\r\nbursts are regulated to occur within 300 and 200 m., respectively, in\r\nfront of the target. The superiority of the shrapnel fired from a field\r\ngun is due to the greater penetration of the jacketed bullets (a result\r\nof greater velocity of the projectile itself at the point of burst).\r\nBut in this connection it is to be borne in mind that the effect of\r\nsingle shots only is here considered. The shrapnel fire of the field\r\ngun is considerably superior to that of the howitzer. This is due to\r\nthe fact that the howitzer fires more slowly than the field gun and\r\nmust expend twice the weight of ammunition to produce the same results.\r\nIf, in addition, it is remembered that the field battery carries\r\napproximately 2¹⁄₂ times as many shrapnel as the light field howitzer\r\nbattery, it is obvious that the fire of the former will be 2¹⁄₂ times\r\nas effective, against targets in the open, as that of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the heavier projectile asserts itself when it\r\nbecomes necessary to destroy material objects.\r\n\r\nThe shell fired from pieces having a flat trajectory is employed\r\nagainst troops immediately behind cover. The shell is burst immediately\r\nin front of, over, or in rear of the target, which is thus struck by\r\nsplinters from above. The more nearly perpendicular the splinters\r\nstrike the target, and the greater their number and weight, the greater\r\nwill be the effect produced. The angle of the cone of dispersion is\r\nabout 200 degrees; with appropriate points of burst, fragments weighing\r\n15 g. (80%) incapacitate for action. In curved fire, at ranges beyond\r\n2100 m., shell with delay action fuze is capable of penetrating the\r\nsplinter proof cover usually employed in the field. At ranges under\r\n2100 m. its angle of fall is too small to make an adequate effect\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Time Shell, Model ’98.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE HEAVY FIELD HOWITZER.\r\n\r\nThe heavy field howitzer employs shell weighing 39.5 kg., containing an\r\nexplosive charge of 0.85 g., and fitted with a percussion fuze either\r\nwith or without delay action. This shell is designed to penetrate the\r\nroofs of splinter proofs. An earth covering 5-6 m. thick is necessary\r\nto afford protection against these projectiles. At 3000 m. a 15 cm.\r\nshell produces a crater 1 m. deep and 2.4 to 3.6 m. in diameter,\r\n_i.e._, 2 cu. m. (in made ground this crater is three times this size).\r\nThe heavy field howitzer is a very effective weapon against shielded\r\nbatteries. A single shell, owing to its lateral explosive effect, is\r\ncapable of placing a whole battery temporarily out of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. EXPEDIENTS FOR MINIMIZING THE EFFECT OF FIRE.\r\n\r\nMovements of infantry under artillery fire are unavoidable when firing\r\nlines are to be reinforced and when troops intended for the decisive\r\nattack are to be pushed closer to the enemy. Formations calculated to\r\nminimize the effect of the hostile fire must be taken up in time,\r\nsince it is not always possible to make use of cover. The efficacy\r\nof the fire depends upon the accurate determination of the range and\r\nheight of burst (fire for adjustment) and upon the careful observation\r\nof the subsequent fire (fire for effect).[113] The effect of this fire\r\nis considerably increased when the opponent’s infantry, against whom\r\nthe fire is directed, takes up unsuitable formations (particularly\r\nbroad line formations). Infantry has frequently found it advantageous\r\nto advance in small detachments moving rapidly at irregular intervals\r\nin extended order.\r\n\r\n    [113] The color of uniforms exerts considerable influence on\r\n  observation. According to experiments made in France, colors rank\r\n  as follows as regards visibility: white (invisible at night), light\r\n  blue, alizarine red, green, dark brown, gray, or yellowish brown.\r\n  _Schweizer Zeitschrift für Artillerie und Genie_, 1896, I, p. 39. The\r\n  following colors protect against heat, in the order named (in reverse\r\n  order against cold): white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet,\r\n  black. The position of gray in the list depends upon the amount of\r\n  white or black mixed with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) Increasing the Difficulties in the Adjustment of the Hostile Fire.\r\n\r\nA battery requires about 0.8 minutes (5 to 6 rounds with percussion\r\nfuze) to secure adjustment at ranges up to 750 m. The time required for\r\nsecuring adjustment at the longer ranges is as follows:\r\n\r\n  At 800-1500 m., on low infantry targets,  1.5 min., 6-9 rounds with\r\n  perc. fuze;\r\n  At 1700-2250 m., on low infantry targets, 3.7 min.,  11 rounds with\r\n  perc. fuze;\r\n  At 2000-3000 m., on artillery targets,    4.6 min.,  11 rounds with\r\n  perc. fuze;\r\n\r\nNarrow columns moving to their right or left front are very unfavorable\r\ntargets for artillery, as it is very difficult for a battery commander\r\nto determine the relative position of bursts on the flank of a column\r\nwith respect to the leading element thereof. Such shots are frequently\r\nconsidered as over. Numerous small columns, which make it difficult to\r\ndesignate a target, increase the time required by the hostile artillery\r\nto secure adjustment.\r\n\r\nTroops should not be posted in the vicinity of conspicuous objects,\r\nas, for example, trees, visible at a great distance.[114] Intrenchments\r\nthat have just been thrown up should be made to look as nearly as\r\npossible like the surrounding country by covering them with snow, sod,\r\nor brush. It is made more difficult for the hostile artillery to secure\r\nadjustment, if our infantry changes position to the front or to a\r\nflank, if it moves rapidly or advances by rushes.\r\n\r\n    [114] The cutting down of a poplar at Königgrätz decreased the\r\n  effect of the Austrian artillery fire, which, previous to this, had\r\n  caused rather serious losses. _Geschichte des Regiments, Nr. 2_, p.\r\n  36. A similar effect was produced by tearing down a house at Lovtcha.\r\n  KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den Russisch-Türkischen\r\n  Krieg_, I, p. 59.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, as a rule, for the artillery to adjust its fire upon masks,\r\nbut difficult to determine the distance between mask and target. It is\r\nan advantage when masks are situated obliquely to a position. As masks\r\n(rows of trees) may cause the premature burst of projectiles having\r\npercussion fuzes, they should be at least 200 m. from the troops they\r\nare to =screen=.[115] When so situated they frequently afford better\r\nprotection than actual intrenchments.\r\n\r\n    [115] Fight of some Prussian batteries against a French battery\r\n  masked by chaussee trees at Weiszenburg. See HOFFBAUER, _Deutsche\r\n  Artillerie_, I, pp. 13 and 49. The 4th Light and the 4th Heavy\r\n  Batteries of the 10th Field Artillery (German) were able to\r\n  maintain their position east of Mars-la-Tour, under the fire of\r\n  superior hostile artillery, because they were screened by the trees\r\n  and the embankment of the chaussee thirty paces in their front.\r\n  _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschrift_, 25, p. 18.\r\n\r\n    The sustained bombardment of Schlosz Ladonchamps (situated on\r\n  the Moselle flats north of Metz) with 12 cm. guns, which fired 200\r\n  shots per day from Oct. 9th to 10th, and 100 per day from Oct. 11th\r\n  to 16th, 1870, was unsuccessful, because the percussion shells\r\n  were ineffective. This will not be changed in the future by the\r\n  adoption of high-explosive shells. According to DICK DE LONLAY,\r\n  the garrison of the castle and its park lost only 5-10 men per day\r\n  during this time. The defensibility of the castle was not impaired,\r\n  although projectiles finally fell into the building itself during\r\n  the sustained bombardment. According to the same author (IV, p. 556)\r\n  1,022 shells fell into the park and castle of Ladonchamps on October\r\n  7th, but only ten men were placed out of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) Minimizing the Effect of Fire.\r\n\r\nFormations that increase the effect of artillery fire, as for example\r\nlines and columns, and positions in which a flank is refused, should be\r\navoided. It is a good plan to increase the number of targets and to\r\nemploy narrow columns (column of twos) that are not too deep. Supports\r\nmust be far enough in rear (300-400 m.) to prevent two targets being\r\nstruck by one and the same shrapnel.\r\n\r\nOf the close order formations used in the Russo-Japanese war, platoons\r\nor sections in columns of squads or twos,[116] separated by a maximum\r\ninterval of 50 paces, were indeed found more suitable under fire than\r\nline formations, but the losses were nevertheless very serious except\r\nwhere cover screened the advancing troops from view or afforded them\r\nactual protection.\r\n\r\n    [116] The advance against Beaumont and the height of Chancy during\r\n  the battle of Beaumont. HOPFFGARTEN-HEIDLER, _Beaumont_, pp. 124 and\r\n  238. _Geschichte des Regiments, Nr. 93_, II, p. 97. At Gravelotte\r\n  this formation was employed with advantage by the _Königin_ Regiment\r\n  during its advance on Amanweiler, and later in the campaign during\r\n  the assault on Le Bourget. _Geschichte des Regiments Königin_, pp. 9\r\n  and 132.\r\n\r\nDuring the Franco-German war, line of platoons in columns of twos was\r\nfound advantageous on several occasions.[117] This formation has the\r\nfollowing disadvantages, however: it is very susceptible to flanking\r\nfire; the influence of the officers is principally restricted to\r\nthe leading elements; intervals are easily lost and on that account\r\nit becomes more difficult to form line. It would seem to be better,\r\ntherefore, to advance in line of platoons (or sections) in columns of\r\nsquads, or, under flanking fire, in line of squads in columns of twos\r\nor files. In the last-named formation the intervals between squads are\r\neasily lost, however, and the company then becomes a dense skirmish\r\nline of from four to six ranks. To echelon the platoons slightly has\r\nvery little value on account of the depth of the beaten zone of modern\r\nshrapnel.\r\n\r\n    [117] This formation is also well adapted for passing through\r\n  woods. _Taktik_, VI, p. 108.\r\n\r\nIn attacks made during the latter part of the Russo-Japanese war, both\r\nbelligerents finally made use of thin successive skirmish lines for\r\nadvancing; these lines followed each other at 200-300 m. and united\r\nagain on reaching cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY ARTILLERY AGAINST VARIOUS TARGETS.\r\n\r\n_Germany._ According to computations made by Lieutenant-General\r\nRohne,[118] the following hits may be expected from every time\r\nshrapnel, model ’96, when burst an average of 50 m. short of the\r\ntargets named:\r\n\r\n  =====+=========+=========+======+=================\r\n  Range|Standing.|Kneeling.|Prone.|   Intrenched\r\n    m. |         |         |      |Skirmishers.[119]\r\n  -----+---------+---------+------+-----------------\r\n    500|   18.4  |  10.6   |  6.4 |      3.5\r\n   1000|   14.2  |   8.2   |  4.9 |      2.4\r\n   2000|   12.   |   6.9   |  4.1 |      2.3\r\n   3000|   11.   |   6.3   |  3.8 |      2.1\r\n   4000|   10.   |   5.8   |  3.5 |      1.9\r\n  -----+---------+---------+------+-----------------\r\n\r\n    [118] _Die Taktik der Feldartillerie_, p. 9 _et seq._\r\n\r\n    [119] One skirmish figure per meter.\r\n\r\nThe number of hits per minute obtained by a battery firing 50 shots at\r\n500 m., 30 at 1000 m., 20 at 2000 m., 10 at 3000 m., and 4 at 4000 m.,\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n  =====+=========+=========+======+=================\r\n  Range|Standing.|Kneeling.|Prone.|   Intrenched\r\n    m. |         |         |      |Skirmishers.[120]\r\n  -----+---------+---------+------+-----------------\r\n    500|   364   |   210   | 126  |      70\r\n   1000|   202   |   117   |  70  |      39\r\n   2000|   109   |    63   |  38  |      21\r\n   3000|    46   |    27   |  16  |       9\r\n   4000|    14   |     8   |   5  |       3\r\n  -----+---------+---------+------+-----------------\r\n\r\n    [120] One skirmish figure per meter.\r\n\r\n_France._[121] According to the French Field Artillery Regulations\r\n(footnote to par. 277), a gun firing time shrapnel covers effectively\r\na front of 25 m., and a battery of four pieces, a front of 100 m. This\r\nintensity of fire, which is obtained when each piece fires one shot\r\nwith proper corrector and range settings (the battery four shots)\r\nAubrat calls “_Density 4_.” When _rafale_ fire (two shots per piece)\r\nis employed against a front of 100 m., with proper corrector setting,\r\ndensity 8 is obtained. When the front exceeds 100 m., the deflection\r\nof the pieces must be changed between successive shots (_tir avec\r\nfauchage_). To obtain density 8 against a front of 150 m., each\r\npiece must fire three shots, as prescribed in the regulations. When\r\nprogressive fire (_tir progressif_) is employed, four different ranges\r\nare given, of which only one can be considered effective. When not\r\nsweeping, in this fire, each piece fires two shots, thus also obtaining\r\na density of 8. A density of 1 always corresponds, therefore, to one\r\nround, fired, with proper corrector and range settings, against a front\r\nof 100 m. When a battery (four pieces) fires one salvo against a target\r\nhaving a front of 50 m., density 8 is obtained; by firing two salvos,\r\ndensity 16 is obtained.\r\n\r\n    [121] The following is taken from Lieutenant-General ROHNE’S essay\r\n  on the work of Squadron Commander AUBRAT, _Les exercices de service\r\n  en campagne_. The essay mentioned appeared in the December, 1907,\r\n  number of _Artilleristische Monatsschriften_.\r\n\r\nThe _Commission d’études pratiques du tir_ has made a thorough\r\ninvestigation into the effect produced by shrapnel fire. The following\r\ntable gives a general idea of the effect to be expected when firing\r\nagainst service targets (_i.e._, the percentage of figures one may\r\nexpect to hit when employing fire of varying density):\r\n\r\n  ==============================================+=======================\r\n                                                |        DENSITY.\r\n                   TARGETS.                     +-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n                                                |   4 |   8 |  16 |  32\r\n  ----------------------------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n                                                |  %  |  %  |  %  |  %\r\n  Infantry skirmishers standing in the open, or |     |     |     |\r\n  a single rank line                            | 25  | 40  | 65  |----\r\n                                                |     |     |     |\r\n  Skirmishers lying down; gun crews under fire  |     |     |     |\r\n  but protected by shields of the French type.  |     |     |     |\r\n  Space between shields and ground not closed   |  7.5| 15  | 25  | 40\r\n                                                |     |     |     |\r\n  Infantry lying down behind knapsacks; gun     |     |     |     |\r\n  crews protected by shields.

If the interval between skirmishers in the\r\nopen amounts to 1¹⁄₂ paces, for instance, the front would contain 62\r\nskirmishers, and the resulting loss would amount to 9 men. If the men\r\nhave placed their knapsacks in front of them, the loss would be reduced\r\nby half. A line of skirmishers of the same length and strength as the\r\none considered above, would suffer a loss of 40%, or 25 men, when\r\nstanding up or advancing. About 1¹⁄₂ minutes are required to fire one\r\n_tir progressif_, after adjustment has been secured. The same effect\r\ncould be obtained in about 20 seconds by firing a _rafale_ of eight\r\nrounds, provided the battery has accurately adjusted its fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE EFFECT OF SHRAPNEL BULLETS ON ANIMATE TARGETS.[122]\r\n\r\n    [122] BIRCHER, Colonel and Corps Surgeon of the Swiss IInd Army\r\n  Corps, _Die Wirkung der Artillerie Geschosse_, Aarau, 1899. KÜTTNER,\r\n  _Kriegschirurgische Erfahrungen aus dem südafrikanischen Kriege\r\n  1900_. Tübingen, 1900. HILDEBRAND, _Die Verwundungen durch die\r\n  modernen Kriegsfeuerwaffen_. I (1905). BOHNE, _Über die Wirkung des\r\n  Schrapnelschusses_, in _Militär-Wochenblatt_, No. 74, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe wounds produced by shrapnel bullets are similar to those caused\r\nby the lead bullets of the infantry weapons of the past. When the\r\nbullet strikes normally to the surface, it produces a wound circular\r\nat the point of impact and considerably enlarged at the point of exit;\r\nbones are frequently shattered; and the most serious effect is the\r\nintroduction of foreign substances, such as pieces of cloth, particles\r\nof earth or sand, or of the material in which the bullet is embedded.\r\n\r\nThe effect of shrapnel bullets on animate targets depends upon the\r\nstriking energy of the bullets (expressed by kgm.) and on their\r\ndensity, those of smaller cross-section having the greater penetration.\r\nThe closer the point of burst is to the target, the greater the\r\nvelocity, and, naturally, the effect.\r\n\r\nOpinions differ as to the amount of “striking energy” necessary to put\r\nanimate targets out of action. In France, an energy of at least 4.8\r\nkgm. is considered necessary to disable human beings, and for horses an\r\naverage of 19 kgm., while in Germany, an average energy of 8 kgm. is\r\ndeemed sufficient. The 10 g. hardened lead bullet, having a diameter of\r\n12.3 mm., retains this energy until its remaining velocity is only 120\r\nm. At ranges up to 1500 m., over 80% of the men struck by fragments and\r\nbullets from shrapnel, bursting within 300 m. (and beyond this range\r\nfrom shrapnel bursting within 150 m.) are put out of action. (Par. 30\r\nGerman F. A. F. R.). In comparison, artillery projectiles produce a\r\ngreater number of fatal wounds than infantry projectiles.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the packed knapsack affords protection\r\nagainst all shrapnel bullets having a velocity of 100 m. and against\r\nhalf of those having a velocity of 200 m. The overcoat roll stops\r\nshrapnel bullets having a velocity of less than 250 m. The penetration\r\nof these bullets is so great, at ranges under 2000 m., that when they\r\nstrike bones or vital organs of horses, they produce instant incapacity\r\nfor action. This is especially true when the interval of burst is less\r\nthan 100 m.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. INFANTRY FIRE.[123]\r\n\r\n    [123] Lieutenant-General ROHNE, _Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_.\r\n  Colonel MINARELLI-FITZGERALD, Austrian Army, _Modernes Schieszwesen_,\r\n  1901.\r\n\r\nThe modern infantry rifle, cal. 6.5 to 8. mm., is a magazine arm\r\nemploying steel jacketed, pointed bullets, arranged in clips. The\r\nadoption of automatic rifles is contemplated. In these rifles the\r\nrecoil energy is utilized for throwing out empty shells and for placing\r\na fresh cartridge into the chamber at the same time. The objections\r\nmade to the adoption of such a rifle (complexity of the mechanism,\r\ndanger of wasting ammunition) are similar to the reasons advanced\r\nagainst the adoption of breech-loading and magazine rifles. In addition\r\nto the increased rate of fire, the advantage of eliminating the effect\r\nof the recoil on the skirmisher must not be underestimated. Moreover,\r\nthe elimination of the recoil makes a further increase in the initial\r\nvelocity of the projectile possible.\r\n\r\nThe effect of infantry fire may be considered from two points of view,\r\nviz.: the effect on the enemy of a single projectile, and the effective\r\nhit in itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE PROJECTILE ON ANIMATE TARGETS.[124]\r\n\r\n    [124] See _Löbells Militärische Jahresberichte_, 1905, p. 475,\r\n  and 1906, p. 412, which contain complete references to military\r\n  literature. _Militär-Wochenblatt_, No. 1, 1906.\r\n\r\nDuring the Russo-Japanese war the contending parties used the following\r\nsmall arms and projectiles:\r\n\r\n  ======+=========+=======+=====+=====================+=========\r\n        | Rifle.  | Model | Cal.|       PROJECTILE.   |Initial\r\n        |         |(year).|     |Description. |Weight.|Velocity.\r\n        |         |       | mm. |             |  g.   |   m.\r\n  ------+---------+-------+-----+-------------+-------+---------\r\n  Japan |{Arisaka |  ’97  | 6.5 |Hardened lead| 10.5  |  715\r\n        |{Murata  |  ’94  | 8.0 |core with    | 15.42 |  564\r\n        |         |       |     |copper-nickel|       |\r\n  Russia|  ----   |  ’91  | 7.62|jacket.      | 13.7  |  615\r\n  ------+---------+-------+-----+-------------+-------+---------\r\n\r\nThe ballistic qualities of the _Arisaka_ rifle were superior to those\r\nof the Russian arm, but the maiming effect of the two rifles was about\r\nequal. The striking energy of the projectiles was not sufficient in\r\nevery case, however, to put a man out of action. The explosive effect\r\nproduced by bullets striking interior organs and bones at short ranges\r\n(within 500 m.) was more evident in wounds made by the 8. mm. than by\r\nthe _Arisaka_ rifle.[125]\r\n\r\n    [125] “The projectile that penetrates animal organisms displaces\r\n  and consequently destroys the tissue fibers lying in its path. The\r\n  projectile communicates a portion of its energy to the molecules\r\n  struck, and these in turn transfer that energy to adjoining ones.\r\n  The greater the velocity of the projectile at the moment of impact,\r\n  the more rapid is this transfer of motion. Especially in organs\r\n  filled with fluid are the molecules, like firm bodies, thrown with\r\n  the greatest rapidity. This has a destructive effect which in the\r\n  past has never been observed to be so extensive, and which gives the\r\n  impression that the projectile has exploded in the body. In order to\r\n  produce this effect a velocity of about 350 to 400 m. is required,\r\n  which was, of course, not obtainable in rifles of older pattern,\r\n  and was only possible in the immediate vicinity of the muzzle.\r\n  Whenever the projectile strikes a marrow bone with great velocity it\r\n  shatters it completely at the point of impact, and splinters it to\r\n  a considerable extent, all because the bone is filled with a liquid\r\n  substance.” ROHNE, _Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_, p. 69.\r\n\r\nAt mid ranges the wounds were generally of a mild character, unless\r\nproduced by tumbling bullets.[126]\r\n\r\n    [126] See also _Ricochets_, p. 185 infra.\r\n\r\nExperiments prove that a projectile will tumble if it encounters\r\nvarying resistance (for example, if the projectile strikes an obstacle,\r\neven if that be only a twig) or if it penetrates materials of different\r\ndensity (for instance, if, in penetrating a body, it strikes first upon\r\na fleshy part, then upon bones). In the last mentioned case the bullet\r\nwill frequently tumble in the body. If a projectile be fired through a\r\nseries of boards, placed at intervals, it will tumble in the second\r\nboard, or if not there, then certainly in the third board. Projectiles\r\nwhich ricochet on the ground before penetrating a human body change\r\ntheir form more or less, according to the character of the ground on\r\nwhich they ricochet. As the jacket is frequently torn, thus exposing\r\nthe leaden kernel, wounds may be produced which will equal those made\r\nby explosive bullets.\r\n\r\nThe striking energy of the projectile is sufficient to perforate two\r\nmen at 1200 m. From experiments made with the _Lebel_ rifle on corpses,\r\nit appeared that the projectile passed clear through 5 bodies at 100\r\nm., through 4 bodies at 400 m. (even when large bones were struck) and\r\nthrough 2 bodies at 1200 m.\r\n\r\nIn the Russo-Japanese war wounds were distributed as follows, on a\r\nbasis of 100 hits: lower limbs, 39.5; upper limbs, 25.4; abdominal\r\nregion, 16.5; chest, 15.5; spinal column, 15, and head, 11. Flesh\r\nwounds are generally slight. This is due to the fact that the hole\r\nmade by the bullet is small, that the exterior flow of blood is\r\ninsignificant, and that the wound rarely becomes infected. Projectiles\r\nremain in the body now much more rarely than in the past.\r\n\r\nThe central portion of marrow bones is frequently splintered by\r\nprojectiles, while thicker flat bones (shoulder blades) are cleanly\r\nperforated.\r\n\r\nUnless a tumbling bullet or a splinter of a bone penetrates the lungs,\r\nchest wounds appear in much more favorable forms than in past wars.[127]\r\n\r\n    [127] “A soldier of the 3rd East Siberian Regiment, who had been\r\n  shot in the chest, for instance, subsequently walked to the nearest\r\n  railway station, a distance of over 20 km., and felt fairly well\r\n  except for a slight difficulty in breathing. A lance corporal of\r\n  the 36th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, having received a similar\r\n  wound, began his journey to the nearest railway station on a\r\n  two-wheeled cart. The motion of the cart nauseated him to such an\r\n  extent, however, that he preferred to complete the journey on foot, a\r\n  distance of 30 km.” Dr. SELDOWITSCHI in _Wratsch_.\r\n\r\nAccording to observations made in the Russo-Japanese war, wounds in\r\njoints healed without suppuration, the joint and its mobility being\r\nsaved. Amputations were extremely rare, and the surgeon’s skill was,\r\nas a rule, seldom necessary in the treatment of shot wounds. Chest\r\nwounds were slight, and often many men walked a few _versts_ to the\r\ndressing station, some of them complaining of difficulty in breathing.\r\nAs a rule, such wounds healed in fourteen days. Chest wounds were more\r\nserious when the heart or the large blood vessels were injured; but\r\neven in these cases cures were effected. Abdominal wounds were not so\r\nserious as in the past. Contrary to past experience, skull wounds,\r\nin which the projectile had passed entirely through the brain, were\r\ntreated with fair success.\r\n\r\nThe campaigns in South Africa and Manchuria have amply demonstrated\r\nthat wounds produced by jacketed bullets of small caliber are not so\r\nserious as those caused by 11 mm. projectiles. In addition, these\r\ncampaigns have shown that a further decrease in caliber is undesirable\r\nfrom the tactician’s point of view, for a hit by no means affords the\r\ncertainty, in every case, of putting a man, much less a horse, out of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the wounded man is cured so quickly that in a short time\r\nhe can again participate in action. The British report of losses for\r\nthe battle of Paardeberg, on February 18th, 1900, contains the names\r\nof a great many men who were wounded at Magersfontain on December\r\n11th, 1899. According to British statements, 40 men out of every 100,\r\nseriously wounded by steel jacketed bullets, could be returned to duty\r\nafter 36 days of surgical treatment. Dr. Küttner estimates that of\r\n154 men hit in the chest, 73 were able to return to duty with their\r\norganizations; while, out of 92 men wounded in the knee, only 28 could\r\nbe sent back to duty. Wounds produced by the small caliber _Arisaka_\r\nrifle during the Russo-Japanese war healed more rapidly than those\r\ncaused by the Russian weapon. Flesh wounds of Japanese soldiers, for\r\nexample, healed in ten days, those of Russian soldiers in four. The\r\nfollowing observations were made on wounds produced by the Russian\r\nrifle: Within a week slight wounds were covered by a scab; after\r\nthree weeks they were covered by fresh skin and a part of the wounded\r\nwere then able to return to the front. The remainder, irrespective of\r\nthe number of wounds received by any one individual, were ready for\r\nduty in seven months. Wounds in which bones were perforated without\r\nsplintering, healed in four to six weeks, so that the men could return\r\nto duty within four or five months after receiving the wound. When\r\nbones were splintered the cure was, of course, considerably retarded.\r\n\r\nThe ballistic advantages of a small-caliber projectile (undesirable\r\nfrom the military surgeon’s point of view) have been obtained by the\r\nadoption of a pointed-nose bullet (called the “S” bullet in Germany and\r\nthe “D” bullet in France).[128]\r\n\r\n    [128]\r\n\r\n                                                 Rifle         Rifle\r\n                                   mod. ’88.   mod. ’98;    Lebel rifle;\r\n                                              “S” bullet.   “D” bullet.\r\n  Caliber                           7.9 mm.      7.9 mm.       8.  mm.\r\n  Weight of bullet                 14.7  g.     10.  g.       13.2 g.\r\n  Initial velocity                640.   m.    860.  m.      730.  m.\r\n  Remaining velocity at 800 m.    270.   m.    362.  m.      377.  m.\r\n  Maximum ordinate of trajectory\r\n  at 700 m.                         3.80 m.      1.85 m.       2.10 m.\r\n\r\n  _Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1906, No. 53; _Vierteljahrshefte_, 1907. II,\r\n  p. 281.\r\n\r\nA further advantage of these bullets is that they produce serious\r\nwounds on account of their tendency to tumble. These wounds, while not\r\ninhuman, instantly disable the man struck, or, at any rate, postpone\r\nhis recovery indefinitely.\r\n\r\n=The Effect of “S” Bullets on Corpses.=\r\n\r\n  ======================+====================================\r\n                        |    THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN\r\n   Of the Total Number  +--------+---------+--------------\r\n      of Men Hit        | Fatally|Instantly|Incapacitated\r\n     in Each Case.      |injured.|disabled.|for some time.\r\n                        |   %    |    %    |     %\r\n  ----------------------+--------+---------+--------------\r\n  Flesh wounds    800 m |  ----  |  36.4   |    27.3\r\n              ----------+        |         |\r\n  produced at    1350 m |  ----  |  43.8   |    37.3\r\n  ----------------------+--------+---------+--------------\r\n  Bones struck    800 m |  20.3  |  79.2   |    75.0\r\n              ----------+        |         |\r\n       at        1350 m |  11.1  |  88.9   |    88.9\r\n  ----------------------|--------+---------+--------------\r\n        Average         |   7.97 |  62.07  |    57.12\r\n  ----------------------+--------+---------+--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE EFFECT OF “S” BULLETS ON MATERIALS.\r\n\r\nThe following thicknesses of dry pine are pierced by the “S” bullet\r\n(rifle model ’98) at the ranges given:\r\n\r\n  60 cm     at   100  m.\r\n  80 cm     at   400  m.\r\n  35 cm     at   800  m.\r\n  10 cm     at  1800  m.\r\n\r\nIn sand and earth the penetration of the “S” bullet amounts to 90 cm.\r\nAccording to experiments, 3 mm. steel plates were pierced at 350 m.,\r\nwhile hay stacks afforded protection when 4 m. thick; when of less\r\nthickness, the latter caused bullets to tumble. Embankments of frozen\r\nsnow 1 m. thick, of packed snow 2 m. thick, and of loose snow 3 m.\r\nthick, were not pierced even at 250 m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE EMPLOYMENT OF INFANTRY FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfantry fire may produce either a stunning and paralyzing effect on\r\nthe hostile forces, or it may gradually exhaust, wear out, and consume\r\nthem. The fire will have a stunning and paralyzing effect when it is\r\nsuddenly concentrated upon a narrow front, thereby producing fear and\r\nterror, provided actual losses are added to this moral effect.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the fire will gradually exhaust, wear out, and\r\ndestroy the hostile forces when it is distributed for a prolonged\r\nperiod over an extended front. In this case the material losses\r\nsuffered and the exhaustion of his physical energies may force the\r\nconviction on the enemy that he has no longer a chance to gain the\r\nvictory. This conviction will cause a suspension of all his energies\r\nand consequently of his determination to fight.\r\n\r\n  At =Modder River= (28th November, 1899) the Boers opened fire on the\r\n  British at 1000 m., although they had intended to hold their fire\r\n  until the British arrived within 300 m. of the position.[129]\r\n\r\n    [129] General MINARELLI-FITZGERALD, _Die Gefechte in Natal und der\r\n  Kap-Kolonie_, 1899.\r\n\r\n  The miscarriage of the contemplated sudden burst of fire resulted\r\n  in a fire fight, which tended to destroy gradually the physical and\r\n  moral powers of the British. The Boers, however, gave this gradually\r\n  destroying fire a paralyzing effect by concentrating it suddenly and\r\n  continuously on tactically important targets that were comparatively\r\n  easy to hit. Minarelli makes the following comments on the attack\r\n  made by the British 9th Brigade and Brigade of Guards at =Modder\r\n  River=: “All further attempts to induce the Guards to advance had to\r\n  be abandoned. For hours they lay on the dearly bought ground under a\r\n  blistering African sun, utilizing as cover every ant hill, every tuft\r\n  of grass, on the apparently deserted battlefield, and being morally\r\n  certain that to get up would draw a deadly hail of shot.” In regard\r\n  to the fight of the 9th Brigade, the same author states: “Meantime\r\n  the 9th Brigade fared no better. It had in part been able to get a\r\n  little closer to the enemy (550 to 900 m.), but was then unable to\r\n  advance farther. The actual losses were very small in the ten-hour\r\n  fight, amounting only to seven per cent. The Highland Brigade,\r\n  surprised at =Magersfontain=, fared still worse. The fight growing\r\n  out of the surprise lasted almost ten hours. At the short range at\r\n  which this action was fought, the Boer method of fire (_i.e._, to\r\n  fire only when an enemy raised himself to get better aim, and then to\r\n  employ only an effective concentrated fire) necessarily produced a\r\n  depressing effect.”\r\n\r\nIn order that such a fire effect may be obtained, it is necessary that\r\nthe individual soldier combine coolness and presence of mind with good\r\nmarksmanship, and that company, platoon and squad leaders maintain fire\r\ncontrol and fire direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FIRE DISCIPLINE.\r\n\r\nFire discipline is indispensable to fire control and fire direction.\r\nIt embraces the conscientious execution of all orders and signals, as\r\nwell as the scrupulous observation of all regulations bearing on the\r\nhandling of the rifle and on combat in general. Fire discipline must be\r\nmaintained even though the fire control and fire direction exercised by\r\nthe leaders is imperfect or ceases entirely in the course of the action.\r\n\r\n=Fire discipline= requires:\r\n\r\nPerseverance under hostile fire, even when that fire cannot be\r\nreturned; constant attention to the orders of the leaders, and careful\r\nobservation of the enemy. It requires further, taking advantage of the\r\nground; care in setting the sight and in delivery of fire; an increase\r\nof fire by individuals whenever the targets become more favorable, and\r\na cessation of fire when the enemy disappears; finally, economy of\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nThe decision is prepared by the fire of infantry, supported by\r\nmachine guns, field, and heavy artillery. The fire of troops pushed\r\nto within short range of the hostile position will in many cases\r\nsuffice to induce the enemy to give way, so that the assault encounters\r\nnothing but evacuated or feebly defended works. The Boer war and the\r\nRusso-Japanese war demonstrate that determined troops will hold a\r\nposition until the attacker has massed sufficient troops to charge,\r\nor at least until he threatens to attack with the bayonet. Examples:\r\nTerrayama, on October 11th, 1904. Assault made by the 2nd Division on\r\nMarch 1st, 1905, at Mukden, on Redouts 17 and 18.\r\n\r\nTraining in bayonet fencing has by no means lost importance,\r\nirrespective of the fact as to whether or not bayonets will ever be\r\ncrossed in future. “Bayonet fencing is one of the most important\r\nmeans of strengthening the moral force of the individual soldier; of\r\ndeveloping in him energy, initiative, and courage for making a dashing\r\nadvance.”[130]\r\n\r\n    [130] _Introduction to German Bayonet Fencing Regulations._\r\n\r\nSince the armament of the different armies is almost the same, good\r\nindividual marksmanship, coolness, fire control and fire direction, and\r\nfirmly rooted fire discipline, are the deciding factors in an action in\r\nwhich two equal skirmish lines contend for the superiority of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. FIRE CONTROL AND FIRE DIRECTION.\r\n\r\nThe principal object of fire control and fire direction is to bring\r\nabout a superiority of fire at the decisive point by suddenly\r\nconcentrating the fire of a large number of rifles upon it. This is the\r\nonly way in which a moral effect may be produced on the troops against\r\nwhom the fire is directed, while, at the same time, their losses attain\r\nsuch proportions as to become unbearable. At mid and long ranges,\r\nthe efficacy of fire depends more on fire control and fire direction\r\nthan upon good individual marksmanship.[131] Whenever the appropriate\r\nrear sight elevation is not used, the densest portion of the cone of\r\ndispersion will not strike the target, and the chances of its hitting\r\nthe target diminish as the error in estimating the range and the\r\nstandard of excellence of the marksmanship increase.\r\n\r\n    [131] See ROHNE, _Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_, 3rd Edition,\r\n  p. 85. “The importance of the line shot (_i.e._, a hit on the\r\n  vertical stripe through the center of the German bull’s-eye target)\r\n  in the marksmanship training of the soldier should by no means be\r\n  underestimated, but rather appreciated at its true value. The line\r\n  shot forms the basis of known distance firing, just as the latter\r\n  forms the basis of field firing. Instruction in line shooting\r\n  (_i.e._, hitting the vertical stripe of the German bull’s-eye target)\r\n  becomes a moral factor of the highest value in field firing. It\r\n  cannot be denied, however, that the importance of the line shot, as\r\n  such, decreases with the range. Likewise all attempts to transfer\r\n  the zone of the line shot from short to long ranges have completely\r\n  failed.” Captain KRAUSE, _Die Gestaltung der Geschoszgarbe der\r\n  Infanterie_, Berlin, 1904, p. 1.\r\n\r\nFire control and fire direction lie in the hands of platoon\r\ncommanders,[132] who regulate the fire as their judgment dictates. Fire\r\ncontrol and direction embrace: the opening and cessation of fire; the\r\ndesignation of a target and of the elevation to be used; the kind of\r\nfire and its distribution; the number of rounds to be fired, and the\r\nobservation of the effect of the fire. As a rule, the fire will be\r\ndistributed over the whole front, but portions of the hostile line that\r\nare not clearly visible should by no means be neglected (distribution\r\nof fire). Regulations prescribing the scope of authority of individual\r\nleaders are not considered desirable. The platoon commander possesses\r\nin his squad leaders a medium for communicating with his platoon.\r\n(Pars. 162-165 German I. D. R.). The movements of the skirmishers, the\r\ncorrect _comprehension of the target_, the _distribution of fire_,\r\nthe _rate of fire_, and the _employment of the terrain to the best\r\nadvantage_, are regulated through the squad leaders. The lack of\r\nthoroughly drilled coöperation on the part of squad leaders inevitably\r\nresults, as might be expected, in a so-called “skirmish mob.” The\r\nplatoon commander cannot communicate directly with every individual man\r\nof his platoon, but he can control his platoon through his eight squad\r\nleaders, who, by reason of their position in the line, can exert the\r\nproper influence on their skirmishers.[133]\r\n\r\n    [132] The _Belgian Firing Regulations_ require that the officer\r\n  directing and controlling the fire fight be able to determine: 1. The\r\n  time necessary to produce a certain effect with a given number of\r\n  rifles; 2. The number of rounds necessary to produce a certain effect\r\n  in a given period of time; 3. Whether a given target justifies the\r\n  expenditure of ammunition in view of the situation or the efficacy of\r\n  the fire. The requirements of the _Italian Firing Regulations_ are\r\n  similar.\r\n\r\n    [133] Austria: The position of the platoon leader is not so\r\n  definitely fixed as in Germany; neither is it prescribed that squad\r\n  leaders participate in the firing. In skirmish line fire control\r\n  and fire direction are to remain as long as possible in the hands\r\n  of the company commander. The battalion commander is charged with\r\n  concentrating and distributing the fire; with reinforcing, at the\r\n  proper time, the companies in the firing line; and with replenishing\r\n  the ammunition. At long ranges he designates the companies that are\r\n  to fire, and also the position from which fire is to be opened.\r\n\r\nThe squad leaders are charged with _constantly supervising_ the setting\r\nof sights; the distribution, the careful delivery, and the rate of\r\nfire; and the expenditure of ammunition.\r\n\r\n_The squad leaders participate in the firing only_ when their duties\r\nas leaders permit; and this will frequently be the case in a prolonged\r\nengagement in the same position, especially at short ranges. These\r\nremarks apply also to the range finders.\r\n\r\nIn Italy and Switzerland the squad leaders participate in the firing\r\nwhen the whole platoon is engaged in a fire fight. The advantage of\r\nthus gaining a few better shots for the firing line is more than offset\r\nby the more careful supervision of the skirmishers as is required\r\nin Germany, France and Austria. The platoon leader unaided is in no\r\nposition to supervise the proper use of the rifle and the expenditure\r\nof ammunition; his subordinates must assist him. It is also desirable\r\nto relieve the company commander from the actual duty of fire direction\r\nand fire control. The company commander is responsible for leading\r\nthe company on the battlefield; this does not preclude his thoroughly\r\nsupervising his platoons and observing the effect of their fire.\r\n\r\n“Whenever the company commander is in the firing line, he selects and\r\ndesignates the target and gives orders for opening fire. He announces\r\nthe range found by the range finders and observes the effect of the\r\nfire. Aside from this, he leaves fire control and fire direction to his\r\nplatoon commanders, and interferes only when he desires to concentrate\r\nthe fire of several platoons, or of the whole company, on a certain\r\ntarget, or when he observes something that has escaped the notice of\r\nthe platoon commanders.” (Par. 216 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIn the course of an action, fire control and fire direction will\r\nfrequently be imperfect, whether this be due to the loss of the\r\nleaders, or to the difficulty of hearing commands in the noise of the\r\ncombat. To provide for such contingencies, the skirmishers must be\r\ntaught that, in the absence of fire control and fire direction, they\r\nmay fire (_not that they must fire_) at all targets within 600 m.; that\r\nbetween 600 and 1200 m., they should fire at tall and wide targets\r\nonly; and that, at ranges over 1000 m., as a rule, they should not fire\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n  In the pamphlet entitled, _Actual Experiences in the Russo-Japanese\r\n  War_, p. 11, et seq., Captain SOLOVIEV, 34th East Siberian Rifle\r\n  Regiment, 1st Siberian Corps, states: “* * * There was an almost\r\n  ungovernable tendency among the men, as soon as they had thrown\r\n  themselves down, to open fire without orders; paying attention\r\n  neither to the target designated, nor to setting their sights.\r\n\r\n  “This haste is, first of all, brought about by the desire of drowning\r\n  the consciousness of danger by means of increased activity. * * *\r\n  It is simply impossible to control and direct the fire when the men\r\n  have not been carefully trained. The din of battle, the explosion of\r\n  hostile projectiles, and the thunder of our own artillery make such a\r\n  deafening roar that one can scarcely hear one’s own voice. The long\r\n  firing lines make it extraordinarily difficult to transmit orders;\r\n  even squad commanders can not make themselves understood. Volley\r\n  firing must therefore be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n  “Only whistle signals, if repeated by all non-commissioned officers,\r\n  can be heard; but the men must be trained to obey the whistle signal.\r\n  With strictness and application much can be accomplished in this\r\n  direction; it may even be possible to stop the firing along the whole\r\n  length of the deployed company in the hottest phases of the fight.\r\n\r\n  “The difficulties of fire control and fire direction increase in\r\n  proportion to the intensity of the hostile fire and the proximity of\r\n  the enemy, especially on the defensive. The men get more and more\r\n  restless, their nervous tension increases, the danger seems nearer\r\n  and greater. In such a moment the leader must make every effort to\r\n  keep his men in hand, and prevent the firing from degenerating into a\r\n  wild blazing away at nothing. This is always a sign that the leader\r\n  has lost control of his troops.\r\n\r\n  “The greatest obstacle to good fire control and fire direction is the\r\n  nervousness that usually pervades troops which are not accustomed\r\n  to active service. Only thorough peace training and strict fire\r\n  discipline ensure the maintenance of order in battle and give the\r\n  fire the necessary efficacy. * * * The more laborious the struggle,\r\n  the more embittered the fight, the greater the losses, the more\r\n  fatigue and nervous strain gain the upper hand, the greater and\r\n  more important the role which the officer has to play. The success\r\n  of the 200 men under his command depends entirely upon the company\r\n  commander. The war in the Far East might well be called the war\r\n  of company commanders. The soldiers watch their leader constantly\r\n  and attentively. Two hundred lives depend upon his bearing, his\r\n  determination, firmness, and personal bravery. The men judge the\r\n  situation, the imminence of danger, success and failure, by the\r\n  conduct of their leader. The authority of an officer may rise to\r\n  great heights, but it may also sink very low. To show depression or\r\n  faint-heartedness is fatal; the feeling of despondency is at once\r\n  communicated to the men, the leader loses control of his command, and\r\n  the mischief is done.\r\n\r\n  “In battle, more than anywhere else, the officer must be a commander\r\n  and rule with an iron hand. Nowhere does discipline play as great a\r\n  role as in action. Woe to the troops who have not in time of peace\r\n  become thoroughly disciplined, to whom discipline has not become\r\n  second nature! They will pay dearly for this deficiency in war.\r\n\r\n  “I have observed that in the most critical situations a resolute\r\n  shout, in a correspondingly imperious tone, had a marvelously\r\n  quieting effect upon the men. It is likewise advisable to make, here\r\n  and there, a remark concerning routine duty. For example: ‘Why have\r\n  the sights not been set in that platoon? Platoon commander, see at\r\n  once that it is done.’ Because the commander is angry, and notices\r\n  neglect, everything goes well, so the men reason, and no danger need\r\n  be apprehended. The men quiet down, forget the whistling of the\r\n  bullets, set their sights carefully, point their pieces properly, and\r\n  aim again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3. SELECTION OF THE LINE TO BE OCCUPIED.\r\n\r\nWhile a good field of fire is indispensable for reaping the maximum\r\nbenefit from the power of our rifles, the tactical situation is the\r\ndetermining factor in the choice of a position. The requirements as to\r\na field of fire and the use to be made of it will vary, depending upon\r\nwhether it is desired to avoid an engagement at short range (delaying\r\naction) or whether a decision is to be sought (decisive action). In the\r\nfirst case a free field of fire at short ranges may be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nCover may be used only to the extent that it does not interfere with\r\nconstant observation of the enemy. It is not permissible to hide\r\nentirely behind cover, unless expressly ordered in each case. To\r\nrise from behind cover, for the purpose of firing, and to disappear\r\nsubsequently behind that cover for loading, is out of the question in\r\nthe firing line. This is physically impossible and much less attainable\r\nfor psychological reasons; in addition, the skirmisher will present a\r\nmuch larger target than when lying down. When portions of the firing\r\nline cannot see the target during an attack, the platoon commander\r\nshould consider this a hint, either to gain a better position farther\r\nto the front, or to suspend his fire temporarily. (Par. 190 German I.\r\nD. R.). In defense, in a similar case, cross fire would frequently be\r\nthe proper expedient. The attacker will often see nothing except the\r\nheads of the skirmishers who must fire kneeling in order to sweep the\r\nforeground, while these men will present targets of half a man’s height\r\nto his bullets. Since smokeless powder is employed, it is important to\r\nselect positions that cannot easily be found by the enemy. Positions in\r\nwhich the skirmishers are silhouetted against the sky line should be\r\navoided whenever possible. Faintly illuminated targets, or those lying\r\nin the shade, are not fired on at all, according to all experience,\r\nwhile the fire is above all else directed against sharply outlined\r\ntargets. The leaders must take to cover also, for in many cases single\r\nofficers standing upright draw attention to the position. The extent\r\nof the position must be commensurate with the strength of the force;\r\ntoo dense a line reduces the efficacy of fire and increases the\r\nlosses, while, on the other hand, too dispersed a force increases the\r\ndifficulties of fire control and fire direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE STRENGTH OF THE FIRING LINE.\r\n\r\nThis depends upon the purpose of the action. Although a thin firing\r\nline may be employed when the situation is still in doubt (protection\r\nagainst surprise), it must be strong when the superiority of fire is\r\nto be attained. If the firing line is made too weak, we are condemned\r\nto fight a superior force continuously with an inferior one because we\r\nhave voluntarily sacrificed the advantage of our numerical superiority.\r\nOn the defensive, as soon as the direction of the hostile attack\r\ndevelops, the firing line is made as strong as seems necessary for\r\nholding the position. In a delaying action, however, we should endeavor\r\nto place as few men in action as possible; and to compensate for the\r\nlack of rifles by an increased expenditure of ammunition. All firing\r\nis done from the prone position, in so far as the ground permits. The\r\nFrench attempt to regulate the volume of fire by prescribing the\r\nnumber of rifles to be employed instead of designating the kind of fire\r\nto be used.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland and England,[134] it is recommended that supports use\r\n“Fire of position” where the terrain is suitable (hilly country).\r\nThe German Infantry Drill Regulations (par. 340) contain a similar\r\nprovision. When the supports cannot see the firing line on account of\r\nthe conformation of the ground, this fire is not likely to endanger the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n    [134] _Infantry Training_, 1905, p. 132, par. 2; p. 134, pars. 1,\r\n  2; p. 136, par. 6; p. 155, par. 1. See p. 154, infra.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ASCERTAINING RANGES.\r\n\r\n(Pars. 78-98, 190 and 191 German I. F. R.).\r\n\r\nEfficacy of fire depends upon a knowledge of the range. An imperfect\r\nknowledge of the range may be compensated for by the flatness of the\r\ntrajectory of the individual rifle and by the favorable conformation of\r\nthe ground in respect to the cone of dispersion. In collective fire,\r\nat mid and long ranges, each rear sight graduation commands a beaten\r\nzone approximately 100 m. deep--good aim, proper elevation, and careful\r\nfiring being presupposed. The nearer the target is to the densest\r\nportion of the cone of dispersion, the greater the efficacy of the fire.\r\n\r\nThe following results were obtained in Italian firing tests in which\r\n100 skirmishers fired at a plate 1 m. high and 30 m. wide with the 6.5\r\nmm. rifle:\r\n\r\n  =====================+======================+=======================\r\n                       |   MEASURED RANGE.    |  ESTIMATED RANGE.\r\n                       +----------+-----------+----------+------------\r\n                       | Slow fire| Rapid fire| Slow fire|Rapid fire\r\n                       |   [135]  |   [135]   |   [135]  |   [135]\r\n                       |Percentage|Percentage |Percentage|Percentage\r\n                       | of hits. | of hits.  | of hits. | of hits.\r\n  ---------------------+----------+-----------+----------+------------\r\n  At  500 m.           |   21.5   |   15.8    |   14.8   |   11.3\r\n  At 1000 m.           |   11.1   |    8.1    |    6.5   |    5.3\r\n  At 1500 m.           |    5.    |    3.4    |    2.6   |    2.2\r\n  Average results at-- |          |           |          |\r\n  Ranges under 1000 m. |   18.2   |   13.6    |   12.1   |     9.3\r\n  Ranges over 1000 m.  |    7.1   |    5.1    |    3.2   |    3.2\r\n  ---------------------+----------+-----------+----------+------------\r\n\r\n    [135] Slow fire four shots, rapid fire fourteen shots, per minute.\r\n\r\nBeyond 600 m., an error in the range exerts a greater influence\r\nupon the efficacy of fire than does the marksmanship of the\r\nskirmishers.[136] When an improper elevation has been selected,\r\nthe efficacy of the fire decreases as the compactness of the “cone\r\nof dispersion” increases; in other words, the efficacy of the fire\r\ndecreases as the excellence of the marksmanship of the men and their\r\ncoolness in the face of the enemy increase. (See pp. 170 and 171,\r\ninfra).\r\n\r\n    [136] ROHNE, _Das Gefechtsmäszige Abteilungsschieszen der\r\n  Infanterie_, p. 13.\r\n\r\nThe following expedients for ascertaining ranges may be mentioned:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Pacing and galloping;\r\n\r\n(_b_) Estimating distances on the ground by eye (by comparison with\r\nknown distances; by estimating part of the distance);\r\n\r\n(_c_) Firing trial volleys (ranging);\r\n\r\n(_d_) Taking the range from a map of large scale or obtaining it\r\ndirectly from infantry or artillery already engaged;\r\n\r\n(_e_) Measuring the range directly on the ground.\r\n\r\n  Pacing (employed in Russia, France, and Austria) gives inaccurate\r\n  results. There is a difference between the number of paces a man\r\n  takes per 100 m., on a chaussee and in a ploughed field. Length of\r\n  pace depends upon the character and slope of the ground.[137] In\r\n  pacing over varied ground, a man follows the slope line while the\r\n  projectile follows an airline. Therefore it would seem that pacing is\r\n  only practicable at short ranges when the enemy is not near. The same\r\n  is true of galloping over the distance. (The length of a horse’s jump\r\n  at a gallop is on an average 3 m.).\r\n\r\n    [137] Professor RZIHA ascertained the following diminution of the\r\n  length of a pace at different degrees of slope:\r\n\r\n  _Descending_ slope, degrees.   0     5    10    15    20    25    30\r\n  Length of pace in cm.         77    70    62    56    50    45    30\r\n  Number of paces per 100 m.   129   143   161   179   200   222   333\r\n\r\n  _Ascending_ slope, degrees.    0     5    10    15    20    25    30\r\n  Length of pace in cm.         77    74    72    70    67    60    50\r\n  Number of paces per 100 m.   120   135   138   143   148   166   200\r\n\r\n  According to Major CZERNY, Austrian Army (_Treffwahrscheinlichkeit_,\r\n  in _Streffleur_, 1906, II), the error may be as much as 16 per cent\r\n  of the range.\r\n\r\nIn estimates made by individual men, the error amounts approximately\r\nto one-eighth (12.5%) of the range;[138] this may be corrected by\r\ntaking the mean of a considerable number of estimates, or by employing\r\ncombined sights at ranges over 1000 m. (the difference between rear\r\nsight elevations being 100 to 200 m.), thus increasing the depth of\r\nthe beaten zone. The accuracy of the resulting fire is influenced\r\nby local and atmospheric conditions. (Par. 80 German I. F. R.).\r\nEstimates usually fall short of the correct distance when made in\r\nbright sunlight; in clear atmosphere; when the sun is in rear of the\r\nman estimating; when made over uniform surfaces; over water; when\r\nthe target is set off by a bright background; when made over rolling\r\nground, especially when the several depressions cannot be seen. On the\r\nother hand, estimates frequently exceed the correct range when made in\r\na flickering light; against a dark background; against the sun; when\r\nthe sky is overcast; during foggy weather; in the dusk; in woods; and\r\nagainst an enemy who is only partially visible. According to the Swiss\r\nFiring Regulations (1906) estimates made from a height downward are\r\nusually too short, and those made from low ground up, too great.\r\n\r\n    [138] Lieutenant-General ROHNE, _Das Gefechtsmäszige\r\n  Abteilungsschieszen der Infanterie_, 4th Edition, p. 12.\r\n\r\n    The following statement is taken from a report made at the British\r\n  Musketry School at Hythe (5th Nov., 1905). In a great number of\r\n  estimates under 700 yards (630 m.) the results given below were\r\n  obtained:\r\n\r\n                                          --------Error--------  Greater\r\n                                 Correct  ±50 yards  ±100 yards  errors\r\n  Officers of the Regular Army      15        49          20       14%\r\n  Officers of Militia and\r\n  Volunteers                        20        44          22       20%\r\n\r\n  France: Officers made errors of 20% at the beginning of the period of\r\n  instruction, 12% at its close; rank and file of the Regular Army and\r\n  non-commissioned officers of the Reserve made errors of 30%.\r\n\r\nIn action, under the influence of danger, estimates are usually\r\nshort.[139] Peace training proves that the skill of the majority of\r\nsoldiers in estimating distances can be improved only up to a certain\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n    [139] The advance of the IInd Battalion of the 2nd Hessian Regiment\r\n  on August 18th, 1870, from the Bols de la Cusse against the height\r\n  northwest of Amanweiler: “The companies, who supposed the enemy to\r\n  be much nearer” (the actual range was 1,100 to 1,200 m.), “advanced,\r\n  cheering, and were received with mitrailleuse, shell, and rifle fire\r\n  (from hill 1,030) which swept the railroad line.” HESSERT.\r\n\r\n    Battle of Plevna, September 11th, 1877. Debouchment from corn\r\n  fields: “The distance still to be crossed before the Turkish\r\n  works were reached was underestimated. One company cheered when\r\n  at a distance of 900 to 1,000 paces from the hostile works:\r\n  the other troops took up the cry and rushed forward at a run.”\r\n  KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den Russisch-Türkischen\r\n  Krieg_.\r\n\r\n  =Germany.= All the men are practiced in estimating distances up to\r\n  800 m. Officers, non-commissioned officers and suitable men (range\r\n  finders) are to be trained in quickly and accurately estimating mid\r\n  ranges, and practiced in ascertaining long ranges. (Par. 78 German I.\r\n  F. R.).\r\n\r\n  “Even a skillful range finder, if he is conscientious, can do no more\r\n  than give a minimum and a maximum estimate of what he considers the\r\n  range to be. The ranges must be communicated to the men accordingly.\r\n  The differences between maximum and minimum estimates should be as\r\n  follows: At ranges up to and including 500 m., 100 m. (for example:\r\n  350-450, or 500-600 m.); between 500 and including 1000 m., 200 m.;\r\n  over 1000 m., 300 m.”\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= Subalterns are, as a general rule, charged with estimating\r\n  the ranges. Non-commissioned officers must be able to estimate ranges\r\n  up to 1000 m. All non-commissioned officers as well as suitable\r\n  privates participate in estimating distance drill, which is conducted\r\n  by an officer in each battalion. The results are recorded in a book.\r\n  The following is the classification:\r\n\r\n  Excellent range finders: Those whose error rarely exceeds 50 and\r\n  never 100 m.\r\n\r\n  Good range finders: Those whose error does not exceed 100 m., and in\r\n  exceptional cases 150 m.\r\n\r\n  Fair range finders: Those whose normal error does not exceed 150 and\r\n  never 200 m.\r\n\r\n  Poor range finders: Those whose error exceeds 200 m.\r\n\r\n  The =Russians= estimate only short ranges, as a rule; the longer\r\n  ranges are determined by means of range finding instruments. In the\r\n  first year of their service all the men are drilled in estimating\r\n  ranges from 400 to 800 paces; officers and twenty specially selected\r\n  men from each company up to 3000 paces. The latter (both officers\r\n  and men) are to make at least 36 estimates in nine days. (Par. 190\r\n  Russian I. F. R.). The result is considered good when the error in\r\n  the estimate does not exceed the figure given below at the ranges\r\n  named:\r\n\r\n    Range in paces.   Error in paces.   Percentage of error.\r\n   400 to 1000 paces       50 or            12.5 to 5  %\r\n  1000 „  2000   „        100 „             10   „  5  „\r\n  2000 „  3000   „        200 „             10   „  6.6„\r\n\r\n  The Russian range finding instrument (_Souchier_) is used by\r\n  officers and specially trained non-commissioned officers; errors in\r\n  determining ranges are not to exceed a maximum of 2-3 per cent.\r\n\r\n  In =Switzerland= recruits are trained to estimate distances up to\r\n  600 m. and specially skilled men up to 1500 m.; all non-commissioned\r\n  officers estimate ranges up to 1000 m. and officers up to 1500\r\n  m. Three weeks after the recruits join, those of the most skilled\r\n  in estimating distances--about an eighth of the total number--are\r\n  selected to undergo further instruction. For this purpose they are\r\n  placed under the orders of an officer charged with this instruction,\r\n  who trains them for at least three hours, every other day, in\r\n  estimating distances on varied ground. The better half of these men,\r\n  regardless of the company to which they may belong, receive further\r\n  instruction. Exercises on wholly unknown terrain are to be had with\r\n  these men and not only extended marches but even railway journeys not\r\n  exceeding 30 km. are authorized for this purpose.\r\n\r\n  In =Austria= the men are required to estimate distances up to 800\r\n  paces (600 m.),_i.e._, up to the range within which they might\r\n  frequently have to choose their target independently. Only officers,\r\n  non-commissioned officers, and specially skilled men are required to\r\n  estimate ranges up to 2000 paces (1500 m.). The mean error of twenty\r\n  determinations at short, mid, and long ranges, of a “reliable range\r\n  finder,” is not to exceed 12 per cent. The _Roksandic_ range finding\r\n  apparatus is said to give errors not exceeding 2-3 per cent when\r\n  skillfully used.\r\n\r\nTo memorize distinguishing marks on the enemy as an aid in arriving at\r\na correct estimate of the range, is not considered as simulating actual\r\nservice conditions, since the power of vision of the men differs.\r\nFurthermore, one sees the enemy mostly in a prone position in action,\r\nand it is not to be expected that the men will remember the various\r\nrules for determining the range by the appearance of the enemy’s\r\nskirmishers. The same is true of the regulation which prescribes that\r\nthe soldier estimating the range is to judge the effect which the\r\ntarget makes upon him. (England and Austria).\r\n\r\nIt will rarely be practicable for infantry to scale the range directly\r\nfrom a map. Infantry ranges are usually so short, in comparison to the\r\nscale of most of the maps, especially those available in the field,\r\nthat it is difficult to take them between the points of a pair of\r\ndividers. Moreover, in an infantry action conspicuous objects are not\r\nlikely to be located often enough near the position of the skirmishers\r\nto make it practicable to find them quickly even on the most accurate\r\nmaps. The artillery is much better off in this direction; its ranges\r\nare longer and therefore more easily scaled from a map. Moreover,\r\nartillery is generally posted on or near prominent points, which may\r\nbe found on almost any map. It should be remembered that a map is a\r\nhorizontal projection, that any range scaled from a map is the base of\r\na right triangle, and that the line of sight of a rifle, when firing\r\nuphill, follows the hypotenuse of that triangle.\r\n\r\nAn accurate knowledge of the range to within a meter is not necessary,\r\nas meteorological conditions,[140] especially temperature and\r\nillumination (degree of humidity of the atmosphere) affect the range\r\nof the projectile. Meteorological conditions may necessitate sight\r\ncorrections amounting to 100 m. at mid ranges and to 150 m. at long\r\nranges. According to the French Firing Regulations a difference of\r\ntemperature of ±10 degrees C., changes the range of the Lebel rifle by\r\n18 m. at 1000 m. The altitude of the terrain increases the range on\r\naccount of reduced barometric pressure; this becomes a factor in the\r\nselection of a rear sight elevation at an altitude of approximately\r\n1000 m. According to the French Firing Regulations, the range of their\r\nrifle at 1000 m. is increased as follows: At an altitude of 500 m. by\r\n18; at 1000 m. by 42; at 1500 m. by 63; and at 2100 m. by 89 m.\r\n\r\n    [140] Lieutenant-General ROHNE, _Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_,\r\n  p. 51, and also par. 70 Austrian I. F. R. The effect of temperature\r\n  and of the altitude of the battlefield was strikingly illustrated in\r\n  the Boer war.\r\n\r\nThese meteorological influences can be eliminated by obtaining the\r\nrange from troops already engaged (artillery) or by determining the\r\nproper rear sight elevation (not the range) by trial volleys (pars. 190\r\nand 191 German I. F. R.) or by an animated fire at will (Switzerland:\r\nfire at will, one round).\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the range by firing trial volleys is, however, practicable\r\nonly when the terrain near the target is visible; when the target\r\nitself is stationary; when the ground is such that the strike of the\r\nbullets can be observed; when the firing party is not under fire; and,\r\nfinally, when the necessary time is available. Since all of these\r\npreliminary conditions will rarely be fulfilled, it will only in\r\nexceptional cases be possible to determine the proper elevation by this\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n  When this method is employed, volleys are fired either by sections or\r\n  by platoons, with the same sight, at some one point of the target.\r\n  For the first volley a rear sight elevation sufficiently below\r\n  the proper one should be selected, so that hits on or in front of\r\n  the target can be expected with certainty. This procedure is then\r\n  repeated, as often as necessary, with correspondingly raised or\r\n  lowered rear sight leaves, until the correct elevation is obtained.\r\n\r\nThis “ranging” by trial volleys promises no result, however, if any one\r\nof the above-mentioned preliminary conditions is not fulfilled. It is\r\nadvantageous to establish a bracket by firing volleys, as is done by\r\nartillery, but even with a good glass it is very difficult to observe\r\nthe strike of small caliber bullets. Whether it would be advisable to\r\nadopt for this ranging a specially designed weapon, firing thin-walled\r\nshell weighing about 400 g., is a question.[141]\r\n\r\n    [141] The 32 mm. _Nordenfeld_ machine gun fires a shell weighing\r\n  400 g.\r\n\r\nThe older range finding instruments depend upon angle measurements at\r\nboth ends of a line (up to 25 m. long). The large range finder (_Hahn_)\r\nhas been adopted in the German army. (Pars. 88-98 German I. F. R.).\r\nThis apparatus permits a range to be measured from one point, up to\r\n1200 m. on low targets, and on taller targets, such as skirmishers\r\nstanding, up to 1600 m. Measurements are considered sufficiently\r\naccurate when the error amounts to\r\n\r\n     2-3%    up to a range of  1000 m.\r\n  3¹⁄₂-5%    „    „    „    „  2000 „\r\n     3-3¹⁄₂% „    „    „    „  1500 „\r\n\r\nOn the defensive the large range finders will find employment before\r\nand during the action. The men charged with the measurement of the\r\nrange should be careful not to betray the position by their activity,\r\nbefore fire is opened. The utility of these instruments is much more\r\nrestricted in an attack. However, it will often be possible, before the\r\nfire fight begins, to ascertain the range from the point selected for\r\nthe first firing position, to the position to be attacked. According to\r\nSoloviev range finders failed completely in action in Manchuria. (See\r\np. 137 supra).\r\n\r\n\r\n6. SELECTION OF A TARGET AND TIME FOR OPENING FIRE.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a target and opening fire it must be remembered that the\r\nfire cannot have a decisive effect unless the target is well within\r\neffective range. The leader should ask himself whether the result to\r\nbe expected is properly commensurate with the probable expenditure of\r\nammunition entailed, and whether this expenditure is warranted in view\r\nof the total amount available. But the decision to fire upon a target\r\nonce made, the ammunition necessary for the attainment of the object\r\nof the fight must be expended without stinting, since all experience\r\nteaches us that an ineffective fire impairs the morale of one’s own\r\ntroops, while it raises that of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a target, its tactical importance is the principal\r\ndetermining factor. The fire is first directed upon the most dangerous,\r\ngenerally the nearest target, or the one which is soon to become the\r\nmost dangerous. Subsequently the fire should be directed upon targets\r\nwhich, owing to their height, width, depth, and density, promise the\r\ngreatest number of effective hits.\r\n\r\nInfantry will, as a rule, offer the most important and promising\r\ntarget, and the fire should be directed against the firing line, since\r\nthe troops following it in close order will in any event come within\r\nrange during their advance. In Italy, when two targets are available,\r\nthe fire is to be directed on the one promising the best results.\r\n\r\nBallistic and tactical considerations determine whether fire should be\r\nopened at long or at short ranges.\r\n\r\nAdequate results may be expected when the fire is directed against\r\nlow targets at ranges of 800-1200 m., but at ranges over 1200 m. a\r\ndecisive effect is only attainable by the expenditure of a large amount\r\nof ammunition. Skirmishers standing may be fired on with good effect\r\neven at ranges over 1200 m. (long ranges).\r\n\r\nWhen the fire is properly controlled and directed, it will be effective\r\nagainst tall and deep targets within ranges corresponding to the\r\nhighest graduations of the rear sight leaves. However, when the targets\r\nare narrow, a side wind is very apt to throw the cone of dispersion off\r\nthe target.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using our accurate, long range rifle at long ranges in\r\ndefense, thus bringing it into effective play, at a time when the\r\ndanger to our own troops is still very small, is, at first glance,\r\nvery tempting. Military history shows that such fire was successful\r\nhere and there, especially where one of the contending parties was\r\narmed with a much superior weapon, or where the enemy failed to apply\r\nthe proper remedy. But even in these cases it was successful only\r\nup to a certain point. There is this to be said against employing\r\nlong range fire: Its effect is insignificant when compared with the\r\nexpenditure of ammunition entailed; it is difficult to replenish\r\nammunition and it tires the eye and the arm of the skirmisher. Poorly\r\ntrained troops finally do not raise their rifles at all, but blaze away\r\nwithout aiming. To be sure, fire opened at an early moment annoys the\r\nadvance of the enemy, but it cannot seriously retard it. Once the fire\r\nis opened, we want it to be effective; we don’t want to injure the\r\nenemy--we want to annihilate him.\r\n\r\nAlthough we fully appreciate the good results obtained at long ranges\r\non the target range, we prefer to utilize the entire staggering fire\r\neffect of our weapons at short and mid ranges, wholly for the purpose\r\nof annihilating the enemy.\r\n\r\nSince only small targets, often scarcely discernible by the naked eye,\r\npresent themselves to the attacker, the fire of the defender should\r\nnot be returned at once. The forward movement should be continued by\r\nutilizing every expedient (rushes with breathing spells, and cover)\r\nuntil serious losses are sustained and the leader has reason to fear\r\nthat his men will lose their morale and throw themselves down without\r\norders. Frequently several groups will open fire while the others\r\ncontinue to advance. The endeavor should be to open fire only when the\r\nattacking force has gotten as close as possible to the lower limit of\r\nmid combat range (800-1200 m.).[142]\r\n\r\n    [142] At Paardeberg (18th March, 1900), the left wing of the\r\n  Highland Brigade advanced, without firing a shot, to within 450 m. of\r\n  the hostile position. This advance, to be sure, was made under cover\r\n  of the fire of the right wing of the 9th Brigade, which had made a\r\n  lodgment within 750 m. of the enemy’s position.\r\n\r\nErrors in estimating the range are offset by the flat trajectory of the\r\nrifle only at short ranges, and only at these ranges can there be any\r\nquestion of an effective preparation of the attack by fire. These views\r\nare expressed in the German regulations.\r\n\r\nRecent wars demonstrate that, whenever the attacker opened fire at long\r\nranges, the attack finally came to a standstill, that the troops in\r\nmany cases fired away all their ammunition, and that the whole attack\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n  “Whenever the attacking regiment opened fire this was unfortunately\r\n  a sign that the attack had been repulsed.” This remark made by\r\n  Kuropatkin in regard to the fight of the Russian infantry (center\r\n  group) on Sept. 11th, 1877, at =Plevna=, is characteristic of the\r\n  Russian ideas. On the occasion referred to, the Russians advanced on\r\n  the Turkish works without fire preparation; the firing lines halted\r\n  400 to 600 m. from the Turkish position and commenced firing. They\r\n  succumbed because it never occurred to the leaders to reinforce\r\n  them and attempt to gain a superiority of fire. Even in Skobeleff’s\r\n  attack there was no sign of actual fire preparation, but, as soon\r\n  as the line halted, strong reinforcements were pushed in to carry\r\n  it forward. The attack, made on a front of about 800 m., suffered\r\n  heavy losses, but succeeded, although all organizations were in\r\n  complete disorder. After advancing 1000 m., the decimated first line\r\n  (8 battalions) halted; fifteen fresh companies carried it forward\r\n  some 150 m.; then Skobeleff threw in twenty companies in one body,\r\n  which carried the line forward to within approximately 100 to 150 m.\r\n  of the work. At this moment Skobeleff threw himself into the fight\r\n  and succeeded in taking the Turkish position with his badly cut up\r\n  troops. Doubtless an act of undeniable gallantry, but not one worthy\r\n  of imitation.\r\n\r\n  The war between Servia and Bulgaria (1885) is very instructive in\r\n  this connection. As in 1859, 1870 and 1877, that force was defeated,\r\n  which, trusting to the superiority of its rifles, opened fire at\r\n  long ranges. The Servian skirmishers often did not even get within\r\n  decisive range of the position of their opponents.\r\n\r\nThe British infantry, armed with a long range rifle equipped with an\r\nexcellent rear sight arrangement, allowed itself to be enticed, by the\r\nlong range fire of the Boers, into opening fire at 1200 and 1300 m.\r\n(Guard at Modder River) and even at 1600 and 1700 m. (6th Division at\r\nPaardeberg) against an enemy whose position was not discernible even\r\nthrough the most powerful glasses. The losses were small and not to be\r\ncompared with those which our Guard suffered without firing, during\r\ntheir advance on St. Privat. The advance of the Gordon Highlanders\r\nat Doornkop (29th May, 1900) to within short range of the hostile\r\nposition, without firing a shot, although they themselves were under\r\nfire from 2000 m. on, was splendid.[143]\r\n\r\n    [143] _The Times History of the War in South Africa_, IV, p. 141.\r\n\r\nSince the assailant presents larger targets than the defender, and the\r\nlatter can make preparations for firing, ascertain ranges, construct\r\nrifle-rests, and replenish ammunition without difficulty, it is proper\r\nin defense to open fire at long ranges, especially in delaying actions,\r\nfor then fighting at short ranges is to be avoided in any case. It is\r\nabsolutely correct for the defender to make the most of the advantages\r\nabove mentioned. While everything is orderly and in readiness in the\r\ndefender’s firing line, the attacker’s line is still in the process of\r\nforming. Should the defender wait until the hostile firing line has\r\nsystematically deployed and has made a lodgment within short range of\r\nhis position, or should he produce losses and create confusion in its\r\nranks by suddenly opening fire?\r\n\r\nThe employment of long range fire on the defensive is justified when\r\nsufficient ammunition is available, when artillery is not present, and\r\nwhen the hostile infantry pursues the tactics of advancing to short\r\nrange without firing. “Infantry should never attempt to take the\r\nplace of artillery at long ranges or compete with the fire of that\r\narm.” If it is important for the attacker to reach the extreme limit\r\nof mid ranges with as little firing as possible, the defender should\r\nin the first place fire on him with artillery, and, when this does not\r\nsuffice or is not available, with infantry, so as to prevent him from\r\naccomplishing his object.\r\n\r\nAt mid ranges the efficacy of the defender’s fire is so great, when\r\ndirected upon an infantry line advancing without fire support, that\r\nit becomes an important factor. At ranges from 1000 to 600 m., 8 to\r\n25% hits can be counted on when the fire is directed against advancing\r\nskirmishers; and even assuming an error of ¹⁄₈ in the estimated range,\r\n3 to 12% hits may still be expected. (Par. 623, p. 196, German I. F.\r\nR.).\r\n\r\nIf the attacker is unable to hide from the defender’s fire by using\r\ncover, his losses will increase until they become unbearable; his\r\nattack will hesitate, and he will commence firing. Fresh troops are\r\nnecessary to carry the attacking line forward anew. The success of the\r\ndefense is assured, if the defender is able to prevent the attacking\r\nforce from getting within short range of the position. The defender’s\r\nchance of making a successful counter-attack disappears, however, as\r\nsoon as the attacking force makes a lodgment within short range of the\r\nposition; for the closer the defender is pressed, the closer will he\r\nbe tied to his position. While the superiority of fire enjoyed by the\r\ndefender at mid ranges allows him perfect freedom of action, at short\r\nranges the attacker’s fire imposes conditions upon the defense which\r\nmake the growing power of the attack sensibly felt. The moment the\r\ndefender begins firing, however, he becomes at once a favorable target\r\nfor the artillery of the attacking force. The defender frequently\r\nbetrays his position prematurely by opening fire.\r\n\r\nThe _moral effect_ of withholding the fire (_fire surprise_) is very\r\ngreat.[144] A strong fire will be actually annihilating if suddenly\r\ndirected upon the enemy at short ranges, especially if he is still\r\nin unsuitable formations, owing to his ignorance of the defender’s\r\nposition. (Example: The British brigade under Hart at Colenso, 15th\r\nDec., 1899, and the Highland Brigade at Magersfontain, 11th Dec., 1899)\r\nor if the morale of his troops is questionable.[145] What good troops\r\nshould do in such a situation (employ rapid fire and then advance to\r\nthe assault) is shown by the conduct of the IInd Battalion of the 20th\r\nInfantry at Coulomiers.[146] Steady nerves and iron discipline are,\r\nhowever, prerequisites for the execution of a fire surprise by the\r\ndefender.\r\n\r\n    [144] Marshal BUGEAUD gives a very graphic description of the moral\r\n  effect of fire in his _Aperçus sur quelques détails de guerre_,\r\n  based upon his experiences in the fights with the British in the\r\n  Peninsula: “The men began to get excited when still 1,000 m. from\r\n  the enemy; they talked to each other; the march became more and more\r\n  hurried; and disorder appeared here and there in the columns. The\r\n  British remained quietly at order arms; their calm demeanor was not\r\n  without effect upon our young soldiers. We approached closer, the\r\n  men shouting: ‘_Vive l’empéreur! En avant, à la baionette!_’ Shakos\r\n  were raised upon the points of bayonets; the march became a double\r\n  time; the ranks became mixed; the excitement caused confusion here\r\n  and there; and a few shots were fired from the column. The British\r\n  continued to stand immovable, and seemed to pay no attention to us\r\n  even when only 300 paces separated the two forces.\r\n\r\n    “The contrast was apparent. Everyone felt that he would have to\r\n  deal with an opponent tried in battle; that the fire so long withheld\r\n  by the enemy would surely be annihilating. Our fighting ardor cooled;\r\n  the moral power which calmness, even when only apparent, exercises\r\n  over confusion, which seeks to drown itself in noise, made itself\r\n  felt in our ranks. At this moment, when the highest tension had been\r\n  reached, the British line raised its rifles--an indescribable feeling\r\n  rooted many of our men to the spot--and began to fire. The volleys,\r\n  coolly delivered against a narrow front, plowed through our ranks; we\r\n  wavered, decimated though we were, in order to recover; then three\r\n  overpowering cheers from the opponents’ line, which rushed forward to\r\n  the bayonet attack, and everybody turned to seek safety in disorderly\r\n  flight.”\r\n\r\n    [145] The defense of the cemetery at Beaune la Rolande. HÖNIG,\r\n  _Volkskrieg_, pp. 157 to 212.\r\n\r\n    [146] Dec. 15th, 1870. _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 20_, p. 246.\r\n  KORTZFLEISCH, _Feldzug gegen den Loir_, p. 81.\r\n\r\nLong range fire was employed with success on the defensive by the\r\nFrench at St. Privat (the Germans suffered the most serious losses at\r\nranges from 1200 to 1000 m.) and by the Turks at Plevna. At 1500 m. the\r\nRussian losses were such that they were obliged to begin advancing by\r\nrushes. The losses decreased as the enemy’s position was approached.\r\nThe long range fire had produced a retarding but by no means an\r\nannihilating effect. On the other hand, the fire of the defender, at\r\nextremely short ranges, had a telling effect at Beaune la Rolande; in\r\nthe defense of Chagey on the Lisaine;[147] in the defense of Shipka\r\nPass (200 to 300 paces) by the Russians, and in the engagement at Gorni\r\nBugarov (1st Jan., 1878). Whenever the attacker enters the short range\r\nzone while still in unsuitable formations, his losses increase until\r\nthey become annihilating. (Example: The bayonet attacks made by the\r\nAustrians at Nachod and Trautenau).[148]\r\n\r\n    [147] KUNZ, _Entscheidungskämpfe des Korps Werder_, II, pp. 53, 93\r\n  and 143.

As regards flatness of trajectory and accuracy, the power\r\n  of the needle gun (_Zündnadelgewehr_) at point blank range (280 m.)\r\n  corresponds to the effect of rifle model ’98 at approximately 800 to\r\n  900 m.

Sometimes--especially in minor\r\n  operations--it may be advantageous to let the enemy come up close and\r\n  then open fire on him suddenly.\r\n\r\n  A decisive fire effect can only be counted on when the targets are\r\n  situated within effective range. Ineffective fire is a waste of\r\n  ammunition which impairs the morale of one’s own troops and raises\r\n  that of the enemy. For firing at long ranges it is necessary to\r\n  consider whether a sufficient amount of ammunition is available. Long\r\n  range fire should, in any case, be used only when the size of the\r\n  target makes an adequate fire effect probable, and when the range is\r\n  known, or can be ascertained with accuracy. In long range fire the\r\n  use of small units, each expending a large amount of ammunition, is\r\n  as a rule to be recommended. The _distribution_ and _concentration_\r\n  of fire should be regulated by the officer charged with fire\r\n  direction.\r\n\r\n  “_Effective fire, delivered suddenly, especially when taking an\r\n  enemy in flank or in reverse, even when delivered only by relatively\r\n  small forces, shakes the morale of the enemy in the most effective\r\n  manner._” (Fire surprise). “Under certain circumstances, but\r\n  especially when the enemy has used up all, or nearly all, of his\r\n  reserves, comparatively small detachments, skillfully led, can\r\n  contribute materially to success, or even bring about the decision,\r\n  if they are able to get on the enemy’s flank or rear and open\r\n  fire on him suddenly at short range.” Such fire surprises should\r\n  be attempted when the conditions essential for their success are\r\n  present.[149]\r\n\r\n    [149] In minor operations this would be a proper place for the\r\n  employment of large scouting detachments, the importance of which\r\n  decreases with the size of the contending forces. Such tasks can,\r\n  however, be just as well performed by a well-trained body of infantry.\r\n\r\n  =France.= In _attack_, fire is opened as late as possible, at any\r\n  rate not until the losses make it necessary to discontinue the\r\n  forward movement. Fire is the only means which makes a further\r\n  advance possible.\r\n\r\n  In _defense_, long range fire may be used under certain\r\n  circumstances. “Sudden and violent rafales delivered at short range\r\n  take the attacker by surprise if, all at once, he loses a great many\r\n  men.”\r\n\r\n  =England= (1905). _Attack._ Infantry is to advance as close as\r\n  possible to the enemy before opening fire; small losses must be\r\n  endured. Fire is decisive under 540 m. (600 yds.). Artillery and\r\n  infantry should support each other. Attention is called to the\r\n  support afforded advancing skirmishers by the fire of infantry units\r\n  and machine guns held in rear. The British are thus the first to\r\n  prescribe “fire of position.” Their Firing Regulations require that\r\n  “fire of position” be practiced by company at a range of 900 m. The\r\n  company forms line of skirmishers (2-pace intervals) while movable\r\n  disappearing targets are placed opposite it. The fire is to increase\r\n  in intensity when the attacking infantry advances over level ground\r\n  or finds obstacles; it is discontinued when cover is reached. “Fire\r\n  of position” is not without danger, but seems to be practicable\r\n  occasionally. Aside from its employment in “fire of position,”\r\n  long range fire is to be used in attack in the following cases: In\r\n  enveloping movements for the purpose of enfilading the enemy’s line;\r\n  when favorable targets present themselves; in containing actions or\r\n  in feints; in concentrated collective fire; and finally in pursuit.\r\n  _Defense_: Fire is to be opened at 1000 m. on skirmishers, but it\r\n  may be advantageous to withhold it until the hostile line comes\r\n  within short range. This will give good results when the enemy is in\r\n  ignorance of the defender’s position, or when the attack is made by\r\n  poorly disciplined troops. Continued long range fire tires the eye\r\n  and the hand.\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= In _attack_, the firing line is to reach the extreme limit\r\n  of short range (500 m.) with as little firing as possible; to\r\n  open fire before this with a part of the advancing force is only\r\n  permissible when necessary to carry the line forward. _Defense._ As\r\n  soon as the defender has a chance of obtaining some fire effect,\r\n  he should open fire to prevent the attacking infantry from getting\r\n  within short range. Fire at long (up to 1800 m.) and at mid ranges\r\n  (up to 1000 m.) may also be used for this purpose. The battalion\r\n  commander determines when fire is to be opened.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said in the preceding pages as to the time when\r\ninfantry should open fire, we may deduce the following =General\r\nRules=:--\r\n\r\nIt is permissible to open fire at an early moment only in exceptional\r\ncases when the situation requires it; good preparation, which assures\r\nthe efficacy of fire and a high moral effect from the very beginning,\r\nis of greater importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) IN ATTACK.\r\n\r\nThe attacker should advance without firing to ranges at which an\r\nadequate fire effect against the low targets presented by the defender\r\nmay be expected. To open fire at an earlier moment is permissible only\r\nwhen the defender’s fire is so strong that effective ranges cannot be\r\nreached without firing. Long range fire is only a means to an end. In a\r\npursuit long range fire will, however, be employed for the purpose of\r\nannoying the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) IN DEFENSE.[150]\r\n\r\n    [150] In Manchuria the Russians, when on the defensive, opened fire\r\n  on favorable targets at 1,500 m.; on skirmish lines at 1,000 m.\r\n\r\nFire may be opened at long ranges when sufficient ammunition is\r\navailable, only when the object is to gain time, and in decisive\r\nactions, when the enemy presents favorable targets and we have no\r\nartillery. Unless other reasons prevent, fire is opened as soon as\r\ntargets are clearly discernible and easily brought into line with the\r\nsights. It is advisable to withhold the fire when the hostile artillery\r\nis superior, when the opponent’s troops are of poor quality, and when\r\nit is impossible to surprise the enemy with our fire while he is in\r\nunsuitable formations. In defense, as in attack, the decision must be\r\nsought by the employment of rapid fire at short range.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. PAUSES IN THE FIRE.[151]\r\n\r\n    [151] A Russian company commander contributes the following in\r\n  _Mitteilungen der Infanterie Schieszschulen_: “On Sept. 3rd, 1904,\r\n  the fire in one of the trenches at Liao Yang lasted throughout\r\n  the entire day. The men were finally completely exhausted; their\r\n  shoulders, hands and fingers stiff. They had to be given some rest,\r\n  and something to eat and drink. Then the fire was resumed, only to\r\n  die down again. The fire of the skirmishers was not very effective,\r\n  as they were completely exhausted and used up.”\r\n\r\n  =Swiss.= Firing Regulations p. 44: “It may be advantageous in defense\r\n  to fire on the attacker only until he himself opens fire, and then\r\n  to remain under cover until he resumes his forward movement. A\r\n  prompt resumption of the fire by the defender must, however, be\r\n  assured.”\r\n\r\n  =France.= “The fire should cease when the hostile infantry halts and\r\n  takes to cover; its volume is increased as soon as the assailant\r\n  resumes his forward movement, or when he shows himself in dense\r\n  formations on open ground.”\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of fire depends upon its accuracy, its direction with\r\nreference to the target, and its volume. In the past, pauses in the\r\nfire were necessary to allow the powder smoke to clear away; at\r\npresent they are of advantage because they give the men a breathing\r\nspell; rest eyes and nerves; enable ammunition to be distributed, and\r\nallow preparations to be made for concerted action. In making use of\r\nsuch pauses good cover, good observation of the enemy and instant\r\nreadiness for resuming the fire are essential. In a serious engagement\r\nthe men either maintain a vigorous, animated fire or they rest. If\r\nthe advancing enemy takes to cover, the fire must cease, only to be\r\nresumed with full vigor when favorable targets appear. The attacker\r\n(like the British in South Africa advancing against the Boers) will\r\nin many cases--especially at the beginning of a campaign--be deceived\r\ninto believing that the defender has withdrawn; should the attacker now\r\nadvance, the defender, by suddenly resuming his fire, will surprise\r\nhim to such an extent that he may be repulsed.[152] Pauses in the fire\r\nare a practical expedient for maintaining fire discipline and enable\r\nthe leader to keep his troops in hand. An organization is capable\r\nof performing its duty well, so long as it obeys the command “cease\r\nfiring.” It might be well at this point to determine when the defender\r\nshould _change his rear sight elevations_ if the attacker advances by\r\nrushes. At mid ranges it might be advisable to stop firing, so as to\r\npresent no target to the enemy when his line throws itself down after\r\na rush, and to utilize this interruption for changing the rear sight\r\nelevation. When this is done during a forward rush of the enemy, the\r\nrapidity of fire will suffer at the most favorable moment for bringing\r\nan effective fire to bear upon the enemy.\r\n\r\n    [152] Compare HÖNIG, _Vierundzwanzig Stunden Moltkescher\r\n  Strategie_, p. 145, relative to the various opinions entertained in\r\n  the staffs of Generals v. Göben and Steinmetz in regard to the pause\r\n  in the fire of the French at Point du Jour. _Der 18. August_, pp.\r\n  269, 271 and 352.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. KINDS OF FIRE.\r\n\r\nIn the days of slow loading rifles of limited range, the importance of\r\nthe _volley_ was due to the fact that it enabled the leader to develop\r\nthe greatest volume of fire in tactically favorable moments, or, in\r\nother words, when large targets were visible for a short time. Modern\r\ncombat is conducted under different conditions. When black powder was\r\nused the volley had the advantage of permitting the powder smoke to\r\nclear away during the pauses. This advantage has now also disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the Russo-Japanese war, the Japanese used “fire at will” almost\r\nexclusively. Volleys were used by them only at long ranges; by troops\r\nheld in rear and, after an assault, to get the men in hand. These views\r\nare not changed in the new regulations, but immediately after firing a\r\nvolley the men are to re-load without command. Rapid fire is retained.\r\nThe Russians placed their faith principally in volley fire,[153] but\r\nwere soon forced to resort to fire at will. The Russian regulations\r\nrecommended volley fire up to the decisive firing position, not so much\r\nbecause of a belief in the superior efficacy of this kind of fire, but\r\nout of distrust of the individual training of their men; certainly an\r\nadmission of the deficiency of that kind of training in their army. It\r\nwas feared that fire at will would impair fire discipline and cause\r\nwaste of ammunition, and it was believed that the immediate influence\r\nof superiors could not be dispensed with. Even the new provisional\r\nregulations have not discarded volley fire, which may be employed by\r\nsection or by platoon. Fire at will may be divided into slow fire (one\r\nshot from each squad) and lively fire with counted cartridges.\r\n\r\n    [153] At Nicholson’s Neck (24th Oct., 1899) the British leaders\r\n  ordered their men, who were firing at will on the Boers advancing\r\n  from cover to cover (“_Boer Attack_”) to discontinue that fire, and\r\n  to use volleys only. But the enemy consistently avoided presenting\r\n  large targets to the British volley fire.\r\n\r\n_Germany._ _Volleys_ (pars. 106-108 German I. F. R.) are to be employed\r\nby platoons or companies when in close order; in skirmish line\r\n(par. 193 German I. F. R.) only when the enemy is surprised or the\r\norganization is to be kept firmly in hand. Volleys, however, can be\r\nused only when the troops themselves are not exposed to an effective\r\nfire. An organization will be able to ascertain the range by means of\r\ntrial volleys only in exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n“_The highest attainable rate of fire_--the word rapid fire has\r\nbeen elided--is to be used in attack during the preparation for the\r\nassault; in defense to repulse a hostile assault; in warding off a\r\ncavalry charge; in all combat situations in which a sudden or immediate\r\ncollision with the enemy occurs; and, finally, in pursuit.” (Par. 208\r\nGerman I. F. R.).\r\n\r\n_Fire at will_ is used both in extended and close order.\r\n\r\n  =Volley Fire and Fire at Will. Bursts of Fire (Rafales).= “_Il\r\n  n’y a de feu practicable devant l’ennemi que celui à volonté._”\r\n  NAPOLEON.[154]\r\n\r\n    [154] “Fire at will is the only kind of fire practicable when\r\n  engaged with the enemy.” NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n  “It may be objected that one frequently reads in military history\r\n  of effective volleys. The explanation of this is that many of the\r\n  so-called volleys mentioned in accounts were volleys only in name. In\r\n  a few instances the defender endeavored to fire volleys, but usually\r\n  their effect was insignificant.” V. BOGUSLAWSKI.\r\n\r\n  “Fire at will was forbidden. Volley fire was used only by direction\r\n  of the commanders of the battalion sections of the line. The order\r\n  to fire volleys quickly ran along the trenches. For a few minutes\r\n  a certain amount of unrest was noticeable among the men, which, if\r\n  allowed to continue, might have degenerated into confusion and later\r\n  perhaps into disorderly flight.\r\n\r\n  “The first volley was not quite successful. It was ragged--some\r\n  men even firing a second time without waiting for the command, an\r\n  example likely to be followed by the others. The force was on the\r\n  point of getting out of hand. Volleys fired by neighboring sections\r\n  drowned the voice of the commander. In such situations only personal\r\n  experience and resourcefulness can tell a company commander what\r\n  to do. We recommend a course which has always been attended with\r\n  success in practice. Let the officer commanding a section jump upon\r\n  the parapet and from there give the order ‘cease firing.’ Then, if\r\n  the enemy’s fire permits, and his own heart is stout enough, let him\r\n  order the next volley from his position on the parapet. When once the\r\n  force is again under control, the volleys will be as good as if the\r\n  enemy were not so close.” KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER _Kritische Rückblicke\r\n  auf den Russisch-Türkischen Krieg_, II, pp. 304 and 310.\r\n\r\n  In his _Comments on Drill Regulations_ (16th Nov., 1840) Prince\r\n  WILLIAM, subsequently Emperor WILLIAM I. of Germany, says:\r\n\r\n  “I am personally opposed to volleys by battalion. I am of the opinion\r\n  that in war volleys and file fire will seldom be used. Should this\r\n  fire be used, however, no one will be able to stop file firing after\r\n  volley firing, even though not ordered, _because in my opinion it\r\n  is impossible to combat human nature_, which finds more security in\r\n  rapid loading and firing than in awaiting the commands....”\r\n\r\n  _Russian experiences in Manchuria._ “At first _volleys_ by formed\r\n  bodies of troops were attempted, but later fire at will was used.\r\n  In the latter, the men were forbidden to hurry, were instructed to\r\n  bring their pieces down to the ‘ready,’ and, whenever it was possible\r\n  to see the enemy--who was advancing by rushes--to change their rear\r\n  sight elevations at the whistle signal of their commander.... When at\r\n  a distance from the enemy the men remained cool and fired faultless\r\n  volleys. When the enemy came closer the volleys deteriorated. The\r\n  Russians used only fire at will at ranges under 800 paces. This\r\n  enabled the men to fire on individual hostile skirmishers and to\r\n  place the boldest out of action.” SOLOVIEV.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= _Volleys_ are employed, as a rule, only by bodies in close\r\n  order, for the purpose of finding the range, and for firing upon\r\n  targets which appear suddenly at long range and which will probably\r\n  be visible for only a short time. Fire at will is the principal kind\r\n  of fire used, the rate of fire being increased or decreased by the\r\n  men according to the existing situation. When necessary, the leaders\r\n  should regulate the fire; but this should only be done in exceptional\r\n  cases as the men are apt to increase rather than diminish the rate of\r\n  fire (“Rapid fire”).\r\n\r\n  The _maximum rate of fire_ is to be employed: “In _attack_, for\r\n  the purpose of gaining a superiority of fire at short range; in\r\n  _defense_, for the purpose of warding off an impending assault. It\r\n  is moreover to be used to inflict the greatest possible losses on a\r\n  defeated enemy as long as he is within effective range; and, finally,\r\n  in fire surprises, repulse of cavalry attacks, and in rencontres with\r\n  the enemy.”\r\n\r\n  =France.= The French _Lebel_ rifle has a cylindrical magazine\r\n  situated under the stock and has a capacity of eight cartridges\r\n  which have to be loaded singly. As a rule, _fire with counted\r\n  cartridges_ is employed (_feu à cartouches comptées_) for the purpose\r\n  of obtaining a “burst of fire” (_rafale_). The _rafale_ consists of\r\n  firmly controlled, concentrated, collective fire. Fire at will (_feu\r\n  à volonté_) is also used, eight rounds per minute being fired at the\r\n  short ranges. The rapidity of this fire at will may be increased up\r\n  to 12 rounds per minute by employing the cartridges in the magazine\r\n  (_feu à répétition_). One minute is required to fill the magazine.\r\n  Volleys are to be employed in night combats and when it becomes\r\n  necessary to control the men. In exceptional cases individual men are\r\n  directed to fire.\r\n\r\n  =England and Switzerland.= The only fire employed is fire at will.\r\n  The rapidity of this fire varies according to the nature of the\r\n  target and the range.\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= Fire at will (in close order in two or four ranks).\r\n\r\n  =Japan and Russia.= (See p. 157, supra).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rate of Fire.\r\n\r\nAs regards its rate, fire may be divided into three classes, viz.,\r\n_slow fire_, _accelerated fire_, and _rapid fire_. The command “fire\r\nmore slowly” (or more rapidly) serves only the purpose of diminishing\r\n(or increasing) the rate of fire.\r\n\r\nThe rate of fire depends upon the purpose of action, the character of\r\nthe target, and the available ammunition. Unfavorable illumination and\r\nthe difficulty of clearly distinguishing the target at long ranges will\r\nreduce the rate of fire. The aiming position (_i.e._, whether the rifle\r\nis fired from a prone position or from a rest) also affects the rate of\r\nfire. A well trained company at peace strength will, moreover, be able\r\nto fire more rapidly than one on a war footing.\r\n\r\nHurried firing should unquestionably be condemned. The rapidity with\r\nwhich our rifles can be loaded enables us to produce the maximum fire\r\neffect in the minimum time against narrow targets. _The desire of\r\nthe soldier to make every shot a hit, carefully inculcated in time\r\nof peace, will of itself regulate the rate of fire._ As the rate of\r\nfire depends upon the distinctness with which the target can be seen,\r\nit will naturally increase as the range decreases, thus generally\r\ncorresponding to the requirements of the tactical situation. Moreover,\r\nas it is easier to aim at tall targets than at head targets, this also\r\nexercises either an accelerating or a retarding effect, as the case\r\nmay be. Lieutenant-General Rohne has done a great deal to bring about\r\na correct appreciation of the rate of fire. He states: “The opposition\r\nto an increased rate of fire is perhaps due to the belief that it is\r\ninvariably coupled with a reduction in accuracy. This is not the case,\r\nhowever, and even if it were true to a certain extent, it need not\r\nnecessarily be harmful. To be sure, when a high rate of fire is solely\r\ndue to the excitement of the skirmishers, it is unquestionably to be\r\ncondemned because no attempt is made at aiming; but when it is the\r\nproduct of systematic peace training, it need not necessarily preclude\r\ngood aiming. It is entirely consistent with a high rate of fire to load\r\nand point quickly, to keep the target constantly in view, and, at the\r\nsame time, to aim accurately and to pull the trigger without flinching.\r\n\r\n“The leader who reduces the rapidity of fire in battle in order to save\r\nammunition, wastes lives and time, both more valuable than ammunition.\r\nDisabled soldiers are more difficult to replace than ammunition, and\r\nlost time cannot be replaced at all.”[155]\r\n\r\n    [155] _Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_, 2nd Edition.\r\n\r\nA high rate of fire need by no means be synonymous with waste of\r\nammunition. Ammunition would unquestionably be wasted if fire were\r\ndelivered for hours at the same high rate. It is very probable,\r\nhowever, that in the battles of the future the fire will be moderate\r\nfor some time, or, better still, cease entirely, only to break\r\nforth like a thunderstorm over the enemy when opportunity offers or\r\nnecessity demands. The slower the troops fire the longer they will\r\npresent a target to the enemy. The coolness shown in firing individual\r\nshots at the commencement of an action will disappear owing to the\r\nimpression produced by losses. This is apparent even in field firing.\r\nLieutenant-General Rohne arrives at the following average results:\r\n\r\n  Ranges up to  400      m. 5   rounds per minute;\r\n    „    from   400- 700 „  4-5   „     „     „\r\n    „     „     700-1000 „  3-4   „     „     „\r\n    „     „    1000-1300 „  2-3   „     „     „\r\n    „     „    1300-1500 „  1-4   „     „     „\r\n    „    over  1500      „    1   „     „     „\r\n\r\nTroops going into action for the first time are inclined to fire\r\nentirely too fast, due to their desire to overcome their nervousness.\r\nVeteran troops seek to attain the same result, not through rapidity\r\nof fire, but through accuracy. Only the determination to make hits is\r\ncalculated to overcome nervousness. Wherever this determination is\r\nlacking, wild firing (fire panic), which is in any case difficult to\r\nprevent, will surely result. Fire delivered hurriedly during unexpected\r\nrencontres is almost invariably ineffective.[156] For this reason most\r\nof the firing regulations have eliminated the command “Rapid Fire,”\r\nwhich is only calculated to produce confusion.\r\n\r\n    [156] At Beaumont the 9th Company of the 27th Infantry, after a\r\n  long advance at double time, encountered the flank of a hostile\r\n  battalion. The men became excited, raised the leaves of their rear\r\n  sights, and opened rapid fire, which had no effect whatever, as the\r\n  range was only 200 paces. _Geschichte des Regiments, Nr. 27_, p. 95.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Firing Regulations contain the following statement in\r\nregard to the effect of accelerated fire (see p. 140 supra).[157]\r\n\r\n    [157] Consult also _Schieszversuche der k. u. k. Armeeschieszschule\r\n  seit dem Jahre 1900_, Vienna, 1905. ROHNE, _Schieszlehre für die\r\n  Infanterie_, 2nd Edition, p. 132.\r\n\r\n1. _When the appropriate elevation is used_, two-thirds of the\r\npercentage of hits obtained by firing 5-6 rounds from each rifle per\r\nminute, may be expected when firing at the rate of 12-14 rounds per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n2. _When the elevation selected is too great or too small by 100 m._,\r\nrapid fire produces almost the _same percentage_ of hits as ordinary\r\nfire at will.\r\n\r\n3. _When the elevation selected is in error by 200 m._, rapid fire\r\nproduces almost _twice as great a percentage_ of hits as fire at will.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it follows that, when the appropriate elevation is not\r\nused, accelerated fire will inflict greater losses upon the enemy than\r\nordinary fire at will in the same length of time. Within equal periods\r\nof time the actual number of hits will be greater in animated fire at\r\nwill than in slow fire; but in the latter the percentage of hits will\r\nbe higher.\r\n\r\nOf all the different kinds of fire, the _volley_ is best adapted to\r\nmeet the requirement of keeping the troops in hand, of concentrating\r\nthe fire, and thereby producing great moral effect. Volleys are of\r\nvalue to troops in ambush, in repulsing cavalry attacks, and in\r\npreventing premature firing against the wishes of the commander. They\r\nshould be used against staffs which would be able to seek cover or\r\nspread out when exposed to fire at will.\r\n\r\nAs the men are, however, not equally skilled in loading their pieces,\r\nthe rate of fire is very little increased by the use of volleys.\r\nThe command “Fire” can only be given when the pieces of the entire\r\nunit are directed upon the target. The length of the pause between\r\npreliminary command and command of execution varies, depending upon\r\nthe distinctness with which the target can be seen, the range, and\r\nthe aiming position. When the fire is delivered from a prone position\r\nit will be difficult to determine when the command of execution\r\nshould properly be given. Moreover, as fire from a standing or\r\nkneeling position will be the exception, this has contributed to\r\neliminate volley firing on the battlefield, because the troops lack\r\ncoolness--mental as well as physical--which is indispensable in every\r\nvolley.\r\n\r\nThe material and moral effect of a volley is doubtless very\r\nconsiderable, but who could possibly make his voice heard when a\r\ndeployed platoon of sixty men is firing? How about the efficacy of\r\nthe fire when the men revert of their own accord from volleys to fire\r\nat will, which they will do when their officers are either killed or\r\nwounded and they themselves are exposed to fire?[158]\r\n\r\n    [158] During the advance on Flavigny (Vionville), the support of\r\n  the 10th Company, 12th Infantry, was to move into the firing line for\r\n  the purpose of firing volleys. “The volley was by no means a good\r\n  one, however, and the men at once took up rapid fire. Lieutenant\r\n  C---- jumped in front of the men to stop the firing, but was shot in\r\n  the leg and crawled back. The rapid fire continued along the entire\r\n  line.” _Geschichte des Regiments, Nr. 12_, p. 454.\r\n\r\n    During the war between Servia and Bulgaria the Servians always\r\n  opened the infantry combat with volleys, but after casualties had\r\n  occurred among the officers under the heavy fire of the enemy, the\r\n  steady volley fire soon degenerated into wild, hurried fire at will,\r\n  which produced no effect whatever.\r\n\r\nIf we use squad volleys (Russia), we approximate fire at will without\r\nany of its advantages, besides which, commands, given by so many\r\nleaders, tend to confuse the men. Moreover, it is very difficult to\r\nhandle the platoon, to stop firing, to change target, and to initiate\r\nmovements. Volley firing is therefore confined to the preparatory\r\nstage of combat and to rare moments in which the troops firing are not\r\nthemselves under effective fire. In the defense of fortified positions\r\nmany opportunities will be found for the employment of volley fire.\r\nThe use of trial volleys for the purpose of testing the rear sight\r\nelevation will be confined to a few favorable cases, and it may be\r\nremarked that animated fire at will concentrated on some definite point\r\nproduces the same results.\r\n\r\nThe French, who retained volleys longer than the other powers (to keep\r\nthe men in hand, to regulate the expenditure of ammunition, and to\r\ndirect a concentrated collective fire upon the most important target\r\naccording to the will of the leader), found a substitute in the fire\r\nwith counted cartridges,[159] the “burst of fire” (rafale).[160] This\r\nwas also adopted by their artillery. In Germany, the importance of the\r\nsudden effect produced by these “bursts of fire” is recognized, but\r\nthe same object is sought to be attained by training alone; while in\r\nRussia, fire with counted cartridges has been adopted, not for the\r\npurpose of obtaining rafale fire effect, but for keeping the men in\r\nhand. Rafale fire has the disadvantage that pauses in the fire are\r\nregulated formally, and that these pauses occur frequently at the very\r\nmoment when a favorable target is still visible. Will the individual\r\nsoldier remain cool in the excitement of battle and carefully count the\r\nthree or five cartridges which he is to fire? In defense, rafale fire\r\nis proper, because the skirmisher in the defensive line is completely\r\nhidden during the pauses, while the attacker presents favorable\r\ntargets only temporarily, thus justifying an increased expenditure\r\nof ammunition. In attack, suitable targets are rarely available for\r\nrafale fire, and a substitute for this fire must be sought in well\r\ndirected, steadily delivered fire at will, interrupted by rushes to\r\nthe front. During an attack, rafale fire might degenerate into wild,\r\nuncontrolled fire at will, the rapidity of which decreases only when\r\nthe ammunition runs short. The employment of this class of fire might\r\nsometimes be advisable in action when it becomes necessary to hold the\r\nenemy, that is, in defensive situations. In this connection, one who is\r\nthoroughly familiar with the French army aptly says: “Rafale fire may\r\nbe likened to the wild passes made by a man, backed up against a wall,\r\nfor the purpose of warding off an adversary who is able to decide the\r\ncontroversy with one well-aimed blow.”\r\n\r\n    [159] Temporarily adopted in Germany also.\r\n\r\n    [160] Par. 194.1 of the _French Infantry Drill Regulations_ of\r\n  Dec. 3rd, 1904, states: “The moral effect produced upon an opponent\r\n  by the fire is much more considerable when the fire is concentrated\r\n  and delivered suddenly and unexpectedly.” Par. 194.4 states: “The\r\n  efficacy of the fire, due to its intensity, is augmented when the\r\n  enemy is taken by surprise,” etc. Par. 195.1 states: “The fire is, as\r\n  a rule, delivered by ‘rafales,’ which are short, sudden and violent;\r\n  and, in exceptional cases, by volleys.”\r\n\r\n\r\n9. REAR SIGHT ELEVATIONS AND POINTS OF AIM.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland and Italy the employment of a single rear sight\r\nelevation, less than the actual range, is preferred, even when the\r\nrange is not accurately known. The French regulations are silent on\r\nthis subject. In Germany one rear sight elevation is used, as a general\r\nrule, up to 1,000 m.; beyond that range combined sights may be used in\r\nwhich the two rear sight elevations differ from each other by 100 or 50\r\nm.[161]\r\n\r\n    [161] See ROHNE, _Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_, p. 93, et seq.\r\n\r\n    In view of the greater dispersion of fire in action, the author\r\n  recommends the selection of either one elevation only, or, at the\r\n  longer ranges, the employment of combined sights, in which the\r\n  elevations differ from each other by 200 m. In peace time the use\r\n  of combined sights, by well-trained marksmen, in which rear sight\r\n  elevations differ by only 50 m. would, indeed, be sufficient to\r\n  increase the number of hits, but on the battlefield the favorable\r\n  conditions found on the target range are lacking.\r\n\r\n“Rapidly approaching or receding targets are followed by making proper\r\nsight corrections, rear sight elevations being less than the range when\r\nthe fire is delivered against advancing targets and greater than the\r\nrange when the fire is delivered against receding targets. At short\r\nranges the same result may be obtained by aiming lower or higher. It\r\nshould be noted that, when firing on cavalry making a mounted attack,\r\nthe danger space is continuous when the sights are raised to 700 m.”\r\n(Par. 192 German I. F. R.). As a general rule, the proper aiming point\r\nis the lowest line of the target. When it becomes necessary to aim at\r\nthe center, to one side of or below a target, its dimensions will serve\r\nas a guide. A change in the rear sight elevation is necessary at medium\r\nand long ranges to raise or lower the sheaf of fire; at short ranges\r\nit is practicable to point higher only when the target is tall. When\r\nthe velocity of a side wind cannot be estimated, it is advisable to\r\ndistribute the fire over a broader front. At short ranges the selection\r\nof an aiming point may, under favorable circumstances, be left to the\r\ndiscretion of the individual skirmishers.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. COMMANDS.\r\n\r\nIn recounting the several commands to be given for firing, the\r\nregulations take into consideration the logical sequence of the tasks\r\ndevolving upon the skirmisher. Thus the first command draws the\r\nskirmisher’s attention to the target; the second indicates the range;\r\nthe third directs him to open fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THE OBSERVATION OF THE FIRE.\r\n\r\nThe actions of the enemy are usually the only reliable indication of\r\nthe location of the sheaf of fire directed against him; the observed\r\nstrike of bullets is seldom so good an indication. It is especially\r\ndifficult to judge of the distribution of projectiles from their strike\r\nin front and in rear of the target. Suggestions from the subordinate\r\nleaders, whose view of the target is generally restricted, are often\r\nmore confusing than valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. THE EFFECT OF FIRE.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN LOSSES PRODUCED BY INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY FIRE.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the Austrian artillery inflicted 16% of our losses. In 1870-71\r\nthe French artillery inflicted 8% of our losses. Up to the battle of\r\nLiao Yang the 1st Japanese Army suffered the following losses:\r\n\r\n  ===========+===========================+========================\r\n             |        PERCENTAGES.       |       WOUNDS.\r\n             +----------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------\r\n             |  Small   | Art’y |Cutting |Serious.|Slight.| Very\r\n             |arms fire.| fire. |weapons.|        |       |slight.\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------\r\n  Guard Div. |  88.42   | 11.50 |  0.08  | 32.17  | 62.49 |  5.34\r\n  2d Div.    |  89.43   |  7.91 |  2.30  | 44.05  | 54.89 |  1.06\r\n  12th Div.  |  80.52   | 14.48 |  2.09  | 39.12  | 46.36 | 14.52\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------\r\n  Average    |  86.12   | 11.30 |  2.09  | 38.45  | 54.58 |  6.97\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nThe figures given above under the captions “serious” (including\r\nkilled), “slight,” and “very slight” wounds have, of course, only a\r\nrelative value. The following figures express the average losses of\r\nRussians and Japanese:\r\n\r\n  Losses through rifle fire      85.9%\r\n  Losses through artillery fire  11.4%\r\n  Losses through cutting weapons  3.2%\r\n\r\nModern fire tactics count upon a prolonged fire for the purpose\r\nof gradually exhausting the enemy, and upon rapid fire, suddenly\r\ndelivered, for annihilating him.\r\n\r\nWhile a statement of the percentage of hits[162] throws some light upon\r\nthe effect of the fire of an organization, under normal conditions, the\r\nnumber of figures placed out of action affords a standard of comparison\r\nby means of which tactical success may be measured, and aids in\r\ndeciding how to distribute the fire. Differences in fire effect on like\r\ntargets are best determined by comparing the number of figures hit per\r\nminute by 100 marksmen, as a great number of hits is presupposed, which\r\nis not the case when the percentage of hits is taken.\r\n\r\n    [162] In this connection the following works have been consulted:\r\n  _Das Gefechtsmäszige Abteilungsschieszen der Infanterie_, 4th\r\n  Edition (1905), by Lieutenant-General ROHNE, and _Schieszlehre\r\n  für die Infanterie_, 2nd Edition (1906), by the same author;\r\n  also _Militär-Wochenblatt_ No. 46 of 1900. To be sure, absolute\r\n  trustworthiness cannot be claimed for the figures given, for the\r\n  conditions of firing in action are variable; but, as obtained by\r\n  Lieutenant-General Rohne, they serve as an excellent standard of\r\n  comparison, and, when their relative value is considered, as a basis\r\n  for tactical deductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) Influence of Training.\r\n\r\nIndividual skill in marksmanship is of decisive importance when firing\r\nat targets of appropriate size at the short ranges. A good marksman,\r\nfiring at will, may (not _must_) expect a hit from each round fired,\r\nat any target within 250 m., at a single kneeling opponent within 350\r\nm., at a kneeling file within 500 m., and at a standing file within\r\n600 m. At ranges beyond this, influences, due to the imperfections of\r\nthe rifle, make themselves felt; and these influences grow to such\r\nan extent that the best marksmanship training is unable to eliminate\r\nthem. A considerable number of rifles must fire in order to produce\r\nan effect; for, as some of the pieces fire short and others over,\r\nthe hits are thus distributed over a greater area. But even here\r\nskill in marksmanship is apparent in that the cone of dispersion of\r\nthe excellent shots produces a shot group of small diameter, that of\r\nthe poorer shots one of very large diameter. Lieutenant-General Rohne\r\ncomputed (_Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_, p. 84) that when firing\r\nrifle model ’98 with the appropriate elevation at a target 1 m. high,\r\nthe marksmen named in the following table would obtain the number of\r\nhits given at the ranges indicated:\r\n\r\n  =======+========================================\r\n         |         NUMBER OF HITS OBTAINED BY\r\n         +---------------+------------+-----------\r\n   Range.|Excellent shots| Fair shots | Poor shots\r\n         |        Out of 100 rounds fired.\r\n  -------+---------------+------------+-----------\r\n  1000 m.|     27.       |    17.6    |    8.9\r\n  1500 m.|     14.2      |     9.7    |    4.8\r\n  -------+---------------+------------+-----------\r\n\r\nThis ratio changes, however, very seriously to the disadvantage of the\r\nexcellent marksmen when the appropriate elevation is not used. The\r\nfigure given below, in which the curves of hits are traced, shows that\r\neven poor shots may obtain better results in this case.\r\n\r\nFrom this may be deduced the great importance of quickly and accurately\r\nascertaining the range. The excellent ballistic qualities of our rifle\r\nand our thorough marksmanship training can assert themselves fully only\r\nwhen the range has been accurately determined. At ranges over 800 m.\r\ntoo great an accuracy in collective fire may be actually detrimental.\r\nIn this case individual accuracy matters little; the important thing is\r\nto direct the densest portion of the sheaf of fire, with some degree\r\nof accuracy, on a target the range to which is known only in a general\r\nway. The importance of training soldiers in precise marksmanship\r\nis ethical rather than practical, for a good target shot need not\r\nnecessarily be a battle marksman. For the latter a cool head is of more\r\nvalue than all the marksmanship skill of the target range.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) Influence of the Error in Estimating the Range.\r\n\r\nAt short ranges an error of estimation is offset by the flatness of\r\nthe trajectory. Lieutenant-General Rohne used a probable error in\r\nestimation of ¹⁄₈ (12.5%) of the range in his computations. The Swiss\r\nFiring Regulations of 1905 count on an error of 100 m. at 500 m., 200\r\nm. at 500 to 1,000 m., 300 m. at ranges over 1,000 m., and the average\r\nis taken to be ¹⁄₅ of the range, or 20%. For measurements with range\r\nfinding instruments see p. 146, supra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the number of hits per 100 rounds fired, at a\r\ntarget 1 m. high, by the marksmen named, is shown under--\r\n\r\n“a” When the fire is controlled and the appropriate elevation is used;\r\n\r\n“b” When each skirmisher has selected the elevation corresponding to\r\nhis estimate of the range. In this case it is presumed, however, that\r\nthe ranges are generally estimated correctly.

Number of Rounds to be Expended.\r\n\r\nThe greater the losses inflicted within a short period of time in a\r\nlimited space, the greater the moral effect of the fire. It should\r\ntherefore be the aim of the officer charged with fire direction to\r\nbring about a decisive effect within the shortest possible time. The\r\nleaders must bear in mind from the beginning of the fire fight that the\r\nammunition carried is limited and that the expenditure of a certain\r\namount is equivalent to a loss of power, and this is permissible only\r\nwhere commensurate results would be achieved. When once a decision has\r\nbeen formed to fire on a target, the ammunition necessary to accomplish\r\nthe object of the fight must be expended without stinting, since\r\nineffective fire impairs the morale of one’s own troops and raises that\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy is approximately equal to us in numbers, and is deployed\r\nin line at one man per meter of front, presenting breast targets only,\r\nthe number of rounds per rifle, given in round figures in the following\r\ntable, will be required to place about one-third of the enemy’s force\r\nout of action:[163]\r\n\r\n  At a range of  300 m.   3   rounds,\r\n  „  „   „   „   400 „    5     „\r\n  „  „   „   „   500 „    6     „\r\n  „  „   „   „   600 „    7.5   „\r\n  „  „   „   „   700 „   10     „\r\n  „  „   „   „   800 „   13     „\r\n  „  „   „   „   900 „   16     „\r\n  „  „   „   „  1000 „   25     „\r\n  „  „   „   „  1100 „   45     „\r\n  „  „   „   „  1200 „   50     „\r\n  „  „   „   „  1300 „   57     „\r\n  „  „   „   „  1400 „   63     „\r\n  „  „   „   „  1500 „   72     „\r\n  „  „   „   „  1600 „   80     „\r\n\r\n    [163] According to ROHNE, _Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_, 2nd\r\n  Edition, p. 214.\r\n\r\nIn the above table it is assumed that an error of estimation of\r\n7.5% was made and that at ranges over 1000 m. two elevations were\r\nused. Against head targets, approximately twice the number of rounds\r\nindicated above must be expended; and against exposed skirmishers,\r\nvisible at full height, about half of the number of rounds given. The\r\nefficacy is increased when the fire comes from a flank. The following\r\ndata are taken from an extended firing test: At 600-700 m., 200\r\nskirmishers, firing 5000 rounds against 200 body targets, obtained 4.3%\r\nhits and placed 43% of the figures out of action; under the enfilading\r\nfire delivered by one platoon, the percentage of hits rose to 10.5%,\r\nand the number of incapacitated figures to 80%.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) Additional Influences Affecting Accuracy of Fire.\r\n\r\nErrors in setting the sight, in pointing, aiming, and pulling the\r\ntrigger, increase the area of the beaten zone at the expense of fire\r\neffect on the actual target selected. When we consider the excitement\r\nof men in action, and the numerous sources of error in setting the\r\nsights, in pointing and firing, it is clear that we have to reckon\r\nwith the =effect of misses= on the field of battle more than with the\r\nreally well aimed and well delivered collective fire of a considerable\r\nnumber of marksmen. Lieutenant Colonel Wolozkoi, late of the Russian\r\nArmy,[164] attempted to obtain an approximate standard of measurement\r\nfor the errors in firing made by marksmen. He bases his deductions upon\r\nthe opinion that the efficacy of rifle fire in action depends entirely\r\nupon the mental and physical condition of the individual soldier at\r\nthe moment; that in serious engagements this condition is such that\r\naccurate aiming cannot be expected; and finally that every skirmisher,\r\naccording to the degree of his excitement or fatigue, will fire his\r\npiece at varying angles of elevation. He argues that this produces a\r\nrigid cone of dispersion, whose limits correspond to certain extreme\r\nangles of error, and whose axis (center trajectory) corresponds to a\r\nmean angle of error; that, for each class of rifles, the depth of the\r\nresulting beaten zone is constant; and that the depth of this zone\r\nincreases with the range corresponding to the angles of error. It\r\nfollows that the depth of this beaten zone is greater in modern rifles\r\nthan in those of older pattern.\r\n\r\n    [164] _Das Gewehrfeuer im Gefecht_, 1883.\r\n\r\nHe believes that peace training will have fulfilled its mission if the\r\nskirmisher, while firing, holds his piece in the position to which he\r\nhas become habituated through years of practice. This position can be\r\nnone other than that in which the piece is horizontal.\r\n\r\nAlthough the theory of the =Rigid, Constant Cone of Misses=, is not\r\ntenable in this form, because there will always be a reasonably compact\r\ncore of hits (the dimensions of which depend upon the conditions\r\nindicated in the firing regulations) at the center of the cone of\r\nfire, the views of Colonel Wolozkoi have, nevertheless, a certain\r\nvalue for us, and find application in large, hotly contested battles,\r\nespecially when the firing line has been exposed to the material and\r\nmoral influences of hostile fire for a considerable length of time. At\r\nthe commencement of every combat we can, at any rate, count on “aimed\r\nfire”; but instead of reckoning at all times with a 75% core of hits,\r\n100 m. in diameter, we must become used to reckoning with a 30 and 40%\r\ncore of hits, of the same diameter, produced by greater dispersion of\r\nthe bullets.\r\n\r\nAccording to experiments made by Colonel Wolozkoi, a good shot makes\r\na mean angular error of ±8 minutes, when using the horizontal aiming\r\nposition; a poor shot, one of ±40 minutes; the average error being ±25\r\nminutes. In this, however, the sources of error, due to excitement\r\non the part of the marksmen, are not considered. “The principal\r\nangular errors can be traced to the nervousness of the marksmen; and\r\nthis is directly proportional to the magnitude of the danger and\r\nthe suddenness of its appearance. The soldier judges the magnitude\r\nof danger by the number of hostile projectiles and by their effect.\r\nTherefore, the livelier the hostile fire, and the longer it continues,\r\nthe greater the danger appears to him; while the less the effect of\r\nthat fire, and the better he is sheltered from it, the less he will\r\nthink himself endangered. On this account, the nervous tension of the\r\nindividual soldier will reach different degrees of intensity according\r\nto the magnitude of the danger.\r\n\r\n“Now there are combat situations where the danger is insignificant,\r\nand entire engagements in which the impression produced by danger may\r\nbe called moderate; moreover, even in lively actions phases may occur\r\nin which this is equally true. The circumstances of each particular\r\ncase will, therefore, determine how long it is possible to fire as\r\nprescribed in the firing regulations, and from what moment a reduction\r\nof efficacy, according to Colonel Wolozkoi’s theory, is unavoidable.\r\n\r\n“The arrival of this moment will be postponed more or less by better\r\ndiscipline and training; and, in addition, at the commencement of an\r\naction, we may count on the men putting into practice, to a certain\r\nextent, what they have been taught in time of peace. However, the\r\nefficacy of rifle fire will deteriorate gradually, as the danger and\r\nthe intensity of the fight increase, until it reaches the stage which\r\nWolozkoi considers peculiar to all of the more serious actions.\r\n\r\n“When discipline is still further reduced, the efforts of the men to\r\nkeep under cover may lead them to duck even their heads and to fire\r\ntheir rifles at high angles. In this case the decisive short ranges\r\nwould not be swept by fire, making it possible for the more determined\r\nof the two opponents to advance to the assault.\r\n\r\n“This reduction of the efficacy of fire (_i.e._, the delivery of fire\r\nat high angles) may also take place when troops are surprised and, in\r\nconsequence thereof, fire hurriedly. This explains why the enemy’s\r\nfire passes entirely over a body of troops which has gotten quite close\r\nto his position--by no means an unusual phenomenon in surprises.”[165]\r\n\r\n    [165] F. C. v. II. _Zum Studium der Taktik_, p. 97.\r\n\r\nWolozkoi assumes that the core of hits of his constant cone is formed\r\nby projectiles fired at a mean angle of departure of less than 4\r\ndegrees, while the lower trajectories of the whole cone of fire\r\ncorrespond to an angle of 1 degree and 30 minutes, and the upper\r\ntrajectories to one of 14 degrees and 30 minutes. If we apply these\r\nfigures to a particular rifle we obtain a beaten zone containing 50%\r\nof the hits (central zone) at 560-1500 m. for the _Chassepot_ rifle;\r\nat 1000-2000 m. for the 8 mm. rifle, and at 1200-3000 m. for the 6.5\r\nmm. rifle. It should once more be emphasized that these figures are\r\napplicable in combat phases in which the men themselves are under fire,\r\nwhile firing, or deliver their fire hurriedly or with bad aim.\r\n\r\n  During the =Franco-German war= the German troops learned by\r\n  experience that the defender’s fire inflicted serious losses on\r\n  the attacker at long ranges, but that the efficacy of his fire did\r\n  not increase as the skirmishers came closer to his position; that,\r\n  on the contrary, the intensity of the hostile fire effect fell off\r\n  noticeably at ranges below 600 m.\r\n\r\n  During the attack made by the Prussian Guard against =St. Privat=,\r\n  the greatest number of dead and wounded were counted at ranges\r\n  from 1200-1500 m., and the fewest losses were sustained at ranges\r\n  from 500-600 m. from the enemy’s position, where it had to remain\r\n  stationary on the slope for about an hour awaiting the effect of the\r\n  enveloping movement made by the Saxon Army Corps. A range of 1500\r\n  m. corresponds approximately to an angle of departure of 5 degrees\r\n  for the _Chassepot_ rifle. The 20th Infantry Division was molested\r\n  by rifle fire from =St. Privat=, during its march from =St. Ail= to\r\n  =St. Privat= (the range in this case was 2200 m., which corresponds\r\n  to an angle of departure of 15 degrees 30 minutes for the _Chassepot_\r\n  rifle) although the skirmishers of the Guard, against whom this fire\r\n  was directed, were only from 400 to 500 m. from the French position.\r\n\r\n  In the =Russo-Turkish war= of 1877-78, the same thing occurred.\r\n  Infantry projectiles reached the Russian reserves while they were\r\n  still 2500 m. from the enemy (this range corresponds to an angle of\r\n  departure of 14 degrees 30 minutes).\r\n\r\n  Kuropatkin corroborates the statement that at 1500 m. and beyond\r\n  (5 degrees 50 minutes), the losses produced by the Turkish rifle\r\n  fire were very serious; that at 400 m. (1 degree 8 minutes) from\r\n  the hostile position, on the other hand, the losses were remarkably\r\n  small, sometimes even ceasing entirely. The Turks finally kept their\r\n  heads under cover altogether.\r\n\r\n  A correspondent writes the following in regard to the engagement\r\n  at =Slivnica= on November 17th to 19th, 1885: “When at 400 m. from\r\n  the enemy, the firing lines suffered scarcely any losses, while the\r\n  reserves, stationed far to the rear, suffered severely from stray\r\n  shots.”\r\n\r\nIt must be the endeavor of peace training to prevent the occurrence\r\nof unaimed firing in battle. This necessitates careful supervision\r\nby squad and platoon leaders over the individual soldier in the\r\nfiring line, and the severe punishment of every act of carelessness\r\nin pointing, aiming, and setting of the sight, in peace time. In war\r\none must constantly endeavor to avoid opening fire prematurely, as it\r\ntires the eye and the arm of the soldier, to check any unjustifiable\r\nrapidity of fire, and to hold the men down to a steady and slow fire.\r\nThis includes, in addition, the avoidance, by the leader, of haste in\r\ngiving directions for firing. In defense, one will have to make every\r\neffort to withdraw one’s men from the moral effect of the attacker’s\r\nfire preparation, and to keep them in proper condition to repulse\r\nthe assault. This requires the construction of splinter proofs, head\r\ncover, and, in case the hostile fire becomes too deadly, a cessation\r\nof fire, which is again resumed when the enemy attempts to advance.\r\nTo carry this out properly, covered observation stations should be\r\nbuilt, and the men instructed to line the parapet and to open fire at\r\na signal previously agreed upon, sights having been set and ammunition\r\nreplenished before they leave cover. A body of troops is not unfit to\r\nresist an assault simply because it has suffered a certain percentage\r\nof losses, but because each individual soldier is so mastered by the\r\nfeeling that he is in danger of losing his life that he fires his piece\r\nwithout raising his head above the parapet. A body of troops in such a\r\nstate will fire its projectiles in Wolozkoi’s “constant cone.”\r\n\r\nA mobilized organization, thoroughly trained in time of peace, will\r\nstill fire a by no means inconsiderable fraction of its projectiles\r\nwith good aim and with the proper rear sight elevation, provided its\r\nofficers are equal to their task.\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) The Influence of Rifle-Rests in Firing.\r\n\r\nFreehand firing increases the rate of fire. Whether the skirmisher\r\nfires freehand or from a rest is of influence on the accuracy of\r\nthe single shot at short ranges. The Belgian, Dutch, and Italian\r\nregulations authorize the bayonet, in the absence of other expedients,\r\nto be stuck into the ground as a rifle-rest, while this is forbidden\r\nin Germany. Collective fire of short duration delivered at mid ranges\r\nhas not been found superior because of the use of rifle-rests. Fire\r\ndelivered from a rest is undoubtedly superior, however, when the barrel\r\nof the piece is heated by continued firing (position of the left hand\r\nsupporting the piece when firing standing, prone, or kneeling) and\r\nwhen the arm of the skirmisher gets tired. When firing from a rest,\r\nhigh shots result from vibrations of the barrel;[166] and there is\r\nalso danger, when under fire, that the men will not raise their heads\r\nover the parapet, but will fire their pieces into the air. This, as\r\ncorroborated by the more recent campaigns, is why a fire fight at\r\nshort range is by no means decided in so short a time as the peace\r\nperformances of modern rifles lead one to suppose, for great losses\r\ndo not take place until skirmishers, who have heretofore hugged the\r\nground, rise. At Spionskop, the two opposing firing lines remained\r\nstationary for hours at 250 m. from each other.[167] The Japanese\r\nfound in their attacks that at ranges from 150 to 75 paces the hostile\r\nfire had no effect.\r\n\r\n    [166] According to the _Swiss Firing Regulations_ the change in\r\n  height in the point of the target struck amounts to ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ of the\r\n  range.\r\n\r\n    [167] The British Infantry (consisting of 2694 men, exclusive of\r\n  subsequent reinforcements), which was engaged at short range on\r\n  Spionskop from 3 A. M. until 9:30 P. M., lost 40 officers and 721 men\r\n  in 18¹⁄₂ hours (one officer to every 18.5 men), _i.e._, 28.2%. See p.\r\n  189 infra.\r\n\r\n\r\n(f) Influence of the Ground.[168]\r\n\r\n    [168] MONDEIL, _De la résolution des problèmes de tir sur le champ\r\n  de bataille_, Paris, 1900.\r\n\r\nSo far we have considered only the effect of infantry fire on level\r\nground. The efficacy of fire is, however, greatly influenced by the\r\ninclination of the ground upon which the cone of dispersion falls.\r\nWhere the ground rises in respect to the line of sight, the depth of\r\nthe beaten zone is decreased; where it falls in respect to the line of\r\nsight, the depth of the beaten zone is increased.[169]\r\n\r\n    [169] Lieutenant-General ROHNE’S definitions are given below in\r\n  explanation of certain technical terms:\r\n\r\n    “_Danger Space_” is the distance measured along the line of sight\r\n  within which the trajectory neither rises above the height of the\r\n  target nor falls below the target.\r\n\r\n    “_Beaten Zone_” is the distance measured along the surface of the\r\n  ground within which the trajectory does not rise above the height of\r\n  the target.\r\n\r\n    Whether a target will be struck by a bullet when the range has not\r\n  been correctly estimated depends entirely upon the danger space.\r\n  In pointing at the bottom line of the target, the aiming position\r\n  (_i.e._, the height at which the piece is held) does not affect\r\n  the danger space. When pointing at the center of the target the\r\n  danger space changes, increasing for low rear sight elevations and\r\n  tall targets, and decreasing for high rear sight elevations and low\r\n  targets, as compared with aim taken at the bottom line of a target.\r\n  “The evil effects of errors in estimating the range decrease as the\r\n  ‘danger space’ increases, which, by the way, is wholly dependent upon\r\n  the ballistic properties of the rifle, upon the range, and the height\r\n  of the target. The danger on the ground in rear of the target fired\r\n  upon, and the difficulty of bringing up reinforcements and ammunition\r\n  over it, increases directly as the beaten zone, which in addition\r\n  depends upon the inclination of the ground to the line of sight.”\r\n\r\n  The importance of this circumstance is frequently so magnified in\r\n  the French infantry that sight is lost of tactical requirements. For\r\n  example, they employ formulae to ascertain the point from which a\r\n  height can be covered with grazing fire, or propose to defend the\r\n  ascent to a plateau by evacuating the military crest and occupying\r\n  the reverse slope, keeping the slope facing the enemy under a grazing\r\n  fire with the tail ends of the trajectories.\r\n\r\nLet A B B¹, in the accompanying figure, represent a horizontal plane\r\npierced by trajectories C B and C¹ B¹, at an angle α, forming the\r\nbeaten zone B B¹. If now the ground falls from B in the direction B D,\r\nit is obvious from the figure, that the angle of fall β decreases and\r\nthe beaten zone B D increases. The limit of this increase is reached\r\nwhen the angle of slope is greater than the angle of fall of the\r\nprojectile. In this case there is a dead angle beyond B and toward D.\r\nIf, on the other hand, the ground be rising, the angle of fall will be\r\nC¹ D¹ B and the beaten zone[170] decreases to B D¹. The smaller the\r\nangle of fall of the projectile the greater the influence of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [170] The computation of beaten zones is based upon the formula\r\n  deduced by Lieutenant-General ROHNE in his work _Schieszlehre für\r\n  Infanterie_, p. 127:\r\n\r\n  Let α = angle of fall;\r\n      γ = angle of slope (rising or falling);\r\n      β = beaten zone on level ground;\r\n\r\n  then\r\n    α\r\n  ----- β = beaten zone on falling ground;\r\n  α - γ\r\n\r\n    α\r\n  ----- β = beaten zone on rising ground.\r\n  α + γ\r\n\r\nFrom this it follows that when fire direction is in competent hands the\r\nappearance of the enemy on the terrain as at B D will be fully taken\r\nadvantage of, while firing on slope like B D¹ should be avoided. Troops\r\nwill, however, rarely be in a position from which they can see a target\r\non the slope B D. The efficacy of the fire will in such a case be more\r\nor less a matter of accident. A body of troops in broad formation will\r\nin this case receive a greater number of hits than a column, since\r\neach meter of front of the crest line receives a certain number of\r\nprojectiles. It is otherwise, however, where the slope rises in respect\r\nto the line of sight. A line is more easily missed than a column of\r\nconsiderable depth on the march.\r\n\r\n  The following data in regard to the increase (diminution)\r\n  of the depth of the beaten zones is taken from the work of\r\n  Lieutenant-General ROHNE on _Das gefechtsmäszige Abteilungsschieszen\r\n  der Infanterie_, p. 44:\r\n\r\n  ======+===============+================\r\n  Range.| Rising Slope. | Falling Slope.\r\n    m.  |   1°  |   2°  |   1°  |   2°\r\n  ------+-------+-------+-------+--------\r\n   800  |  ¹⁄₂  |  ¹⁄₃  |   ∞   |   ∞\r\n  1000  |  ²⁄₃  |  ³⁄₄  |   2   |   ∞\r\n  1200  |  ³⁄₄  |  ³⁄₅  |  ³⁄₂  |   3\r\n  1400  |  ⁴⁄₅  |  ⁴⁄₆  |  ⁴⁄₃  |   2\r\n  ------+-------+-------+-------+--------\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  The above figure, taken from Lieutenant-General ROHNE’S work,\r\n  _Schieszlehre für die Infanterie_, p. 128, shows the influence of\r\n  the ground on the efficacy of fire when “poor” shots are firing at a\r\n  target, 100, 200 m. etc., in rear of which are other targets of the\r\n  same dimensions but situated either on level ground, on a 2-degree\r\n  rising slope, or a 1-degree falling slope. On a rising slope of 2\r\n  degrees the depth of the beaten zone is decreased by half, and on a\r\n  downward slope of 1 degree increased by half.\r\n\r\n  “The knowledge of this influence of the ground is of great\r\n  importance to the tactician. For this reason I have selected ‘poor’\r\n  shots for the above example because the efficacy of infantry fire in\r\n  battle will approximate theirs more nearly than any other. From this\r\n  we may deduce that where the ground slopes upward in rear of a firing\r\n  line, less distance will suffice to withdraw supports from the fire\r\n  directed at the firing line than on level ground; and that, if the\r\n  ground in rear of the firing line slopes downward, the distances must\r\n  be increased unless the slope is so great or the hostile trajectories\r\n  so flat that bullets pass over the crest, forming a ‘defiladed\r\n  space,’ into which no projectiles strike.”\r\n\r\n  On ground rising in respect to the line of sight (_i.e._, on the\r\n  slope of heights facing the enemy, or opposite to commanding ground,\r\n  the slope facing the plain) columns suffer the greatest losses; on\r\n  ground falling in respect to the line of sight (on the reverse slope\r\n  of hills and on plateaus) line targets suffer the greatest losses.\r\n\r\n  Where the ground falls at a greater angle than the angle of fall of\r\n  the projectiles (about 5 degrees at 1500 m., and 1 degree at 800\r\n  m.) a defiladed space is formed, which makes it possible to bring\r\n  supports nearer to the firing line than would be practicable on level\r\n  ground. If we assume that each graduation of the rear sight over 600\r\n  m. commands a space 100 m. deep with the normal core of hits, we\r\n  obtain the following depths of the beaten zones at a range of 1500\r\n  m., with rifle model ’98 (angle of fall 5 degrees and 22 minutes):\r\n\r\n  Ground rising   1 in 10 = 6° =  50 m.\r\n     „     „      1 in 20 = 3° =  64 m.\r\n     „     „      1 in 50 = 1° =  81 m.\r\n  Ground falling  1 in 10 = 6° = 360 m.\r\n     „     „      1 in 20 = 3° = 180 m.\r\n     „     „      1 in 50 = 1° = 113 m.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  The figures on pages 181 and 182 show to what extent the ground is\r\n  capable of increasing or diminishing the efficacy of fire. The French\r\n  assert that the Würtembergers deliberately applied these principles\r\n  in the defense of the park wall at =Villiers=. It was, at any rate,\r\n  only an accident that the masses of troops on the west side of the\r\n  gently sloping Mamelon de Villiers suffered heavy losses on November\r\n  30th, 1870.\r\n\r\n  General PAQUIÉ of the French Army[171] lays down the following rule:\r\n  “When the angle of slope of falling ground corresponds to the angle\r\n  of fall of the lowest trajectory of a cone of dispersion, the depth\r\n  of the beaten zone will be 2¹⁄₄ times greater than on level ground.\r\n  When the angle of slope of falling ground is equal to the angle of\r\n  fall of the mean trajectory of a cone of dispersion, the depth of the\r\n  beaten zone will be 2¹⁄₂ times greater than on level ground. When the\r\n  lowest trajectory of a cone of dispersion passes over the crest of a\r\n  hill at the height of a man, and when the reverse slope of that hill\r\n  is equal to ¹⁄₁₀₀ of the range, the depth of the beaten zone will be\r\n  five times as great as on level ground.”\r\n\r\n    [171] See also _Le tir de guerre et les expériences pratiques\r\n  du camp de Châlons_. _Journal des sciences militaires_, Sept.,\r\n  Oct., Nov., 1808--_Le Joindre Général. Petit Guide pour les tirs\r\n  collectifs_, 1904.\r\n\r\n  These data are of no practical value in war. They serve only to\r\n  increase the appreciation of fire effect when examining the terrain,\r\n  and train the eye in judging such situations.\r\n\r\n  The character of the ground may exert great influence when firing\r\n  on intrenchments. Fire delivered from low ground against an enemy\r\n  in shelter-trenches is absolutely ineffective--as shown in the\r\n  action against the French IInd Corps at =Point du Jour= and by the\r\n  experiences of the Russians at =Plevna= and =Gorni Dubniac=. This\r\n  condition becomes aggravated the smaller the angles of fall of the\r\n  projectiles, and the higher the target is situated relative to the\r\n  firing position of the attacking party.\r\n\r\n  Attacks on hill positions show that there is a range at which the\r\n  greatest efficacy may be obtained from fire directed against the top\r\n  of the height itself. This maximum efficacy gradually dwindles as\r\n  the position is approached. This fact has led the Swiss to retain a\r\n  _Main Firing Position_. (See Figure, p. 182. Fire effect from A and\r\n  from B). For the purpose of determining the favorable range, “D,”\r\n  corresponding to a certain height (of the enemy’s position) “H,”\r\n  Lieutenant-General ROHNE has deduced the following formula for rifle\r\n  model ’88:[172]\r\n\r\n  D = 15.H + 500.\r\n\r\n    [172] Capitaine CUGNAC, D = 14 (H + 50). See also the work\r\n  of Captain KNOBLOCH, _Zur Technik des Feuerangriffs gegen\r\n  Höhenstellungen_, _Swiss Monthly Journal_, 1907.\r\n\r\n    The well-known plateau of the “Galgenhügel” at Wörth, which is at\r\n  present crowned by the monument of the 50th Infantry (elevation 35\r\n  m.) could be effectively swept by the fire of our present-day weapons\r\n  at 1025 m.; a further advance would reduce the fire effect. For rifle\r\n  model ’98 the formula might be stated: 20. H + 600.\r\n\r\n  It is only in fortress warfare that it might occasionally be possible\r\n  to apply this formula. To determine at what distance the defender\r\n  must take position in rear of a crest, in order to sweep the slope\r\n  facing the enemy with his fire (aiming points being resorted to)\r\n  without being himself exposed to view, is of still less value for\r\n  use in the field. According to General Warnet of the French Army, if\r\n  “p” is the degree of slope expressed in centimeters, the defender\r\n  should choose between two points which lie between (p + 5) 1000\r\n  and (p + 3) 1000. When the degree of slope is 1 cm. in 10 cm., the\r\n  defender should take up his position either 600 or 300 m. in rear of\r\n  the main crest. In such a position the defender will, it is true, be\r\n  protected to a certain extent from the enemy’s fire, but can only\r\n  very inadequately defend the slope facing the enemy. A concentration\r\n  of fire on certain targets is impossible and the attacker is given an\r\n  opportunity to reach the crest, here and there, without coming under\r\n  fire. Thus ballistic advantages must be given up in the face of the\r\n  numerous tactical disadvantages. We have mentioned this subject here,\r\n  to show the strange excrescenses which an undeniably sound basic\r\n  principle may develop in the hands of theorists, who have entirely\r\n  forgotten that in war only that which is simple succeeds.\r\n\r\n  “Indirect Rifle Fire” is to be used in firing on a target not visible\r\n  from the firing position. In this connection, the following is\r\n  taken from the report of Captain KNOBLOCH, Austrian Army,[173] on\r\n  _Schieszaufgaben unter feldmäszigen Verhältnissen_:\r\n\r\n    [173] _Verstecktes Gewehrfeuer. Vorschläge zur Erhöhung des\r\n  Gefechtswertes unserer Infanterie_, Vienna, 1904. _Feldmäsziges\r\n  Schieszen der Infanterie aus versteckten Stellungen._ _Organ der\r\n  militär-wissenschaftlichen Vereine_, Nos. 1 and 2 of 1906. _Resultate\r\n  der Schieszversuche mit verstecktem Gewehrfeuer._ _Mitteilungen\r\n  über Gegenst. des Artillerie- und Geniewesens_, No. 12 of 1905.\r\n  _Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1907, No. 28, pp. 144 and 155.\r\n\r\n  “Indirect rifle fire is infantry fire in which aiming points are\r\n  used. These should lie above and beyond the target and in line with\r\n  it. It goes without saying that an aiming point fulfilling all these\r\n  conditions will rarely be found. Moreover, the aiming point must not\r\n  be selected at random at some particular elevation, because the angle\r\n  between target and aiming point, expressed by graduations on the rear\r\n  sight leaf, might possibly lead to a negative sight setting.\r\n\r\n  “In the practical tests made on varied ground against targets of\r\n  appropriate height, splendid results were obtained as regards effect;\r\n  but the aiming point had to be indicated by means of a flag. Despite\r\n  the fact that the terrain was covered with numerous objects, such as\r\n  trees, woods, factory chimneys, etc., no suitable aiming point could\r\n  be found on the terrain itself. This largely determines the value of\r\n  indirect rifle fire in the field.”\r\n\r\n  This class of fire is, however, worth a trial at any rate. Moreover,\r\n  its tactical, combined with its moral, advantages are so great that\r\n  we could afford to accept calmly a fire effect poorer by comparison.\r\n  Indirect rifle fire will, at times, give troops an opportunity to do\r\n  damage to the enemy without being themselves seen or fired upon.\r\n\r\nIt remains to mention briefly the effect of =ricochets= which, as\r\na rule, tumble[174] after striking. Their range upon rebounding is\r\nshort. Bullets ricochet most frequently on water, on rocky and hard\r\nground, more rarely on wet meadows, and on tilled soil, but they do not\r\nricochet at all on sandy soil. Ploughed fields, in which the furrows\r\nrun obliquely to the line of fire, eliminate the effect of ricochets\r\nalmost entirely. When jacketed bullets (but not the massive French “D”\r\nprojectiles) strike upon rocky ground, they have a tendency to alter\r\ntheir form materially, or to tear the jacket, thereby considerably\r\nincreasing the severity of the wound which is produced. The range\r\nof ricochets upon rebounding depends mainly upon the angle at which\r\nthey are deflected. When the lateral deflection is 30 degrees their\r\nrange may amount to about 1300 m. The nearer a bullet strikes to the\r\nskirmisher firing it, and the smaller the angle of deflection of the\r\nconsequent ricochet, the greater its range; under favorable conditions\r\nthis may amount to 2500 m. According to French experiments, in firing\r\nat a range of 800 m., 4% ricochet hits struck a target, the height of a\r\nman, at 1400 m., and 1% ricochet hits a similar target at 1850 m. from\r\nthe skirmisher who did the firing.\r\n\r\n    [174] According to tests, our small-caliber bullets tend to tumble\r\n  even when only grazing small twigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. LOSSES IN ACTION.[175]\r\n\r\n    [175] See _Taktik_, V, p. 76 _et seq._\r\n\r\nAn attempt to move troops in close order formations within the zone\r\nof uninterrupted infantry fire at ranges under 1500 m. when the enemy\r\nis still in condition to direct his fire on them, is bound to lead\r\nto losses which make the further tactical employment of these troops\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nBodies of troops following the firing lines will also have to deploy\r\nwhen the hostile fire reaches them, unless they can find cover. It is\r\na disadvantage for them to deploy, and every opportunity to return to\r\nclose order formation must be utilized.\r\n\r\nTroops in rear, not directly fired upon and exposed only to accidental\r\nshots, should employ narrow rather than broad formations. It might\r\ntherefore seem advisable to remain in route column so long as no\r\nflanking fire is received. The Italian Firing Regulations contain the\r\nfollowing figure showing the effect of fire directed on troops in the\r\nformations indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Vertical axis: Percentage of hits to be expected.\r\n  Horizontal axis: Range in meters.\r\n\r\n  Dash-dot curve: Company Column.[176]\r\n  Dotted curve: Line of platoons.[177]\r\n  Solid curve: Line of skirmishers.\r\n  Dashed curve: Line of platoons in columns of fours, at 15-pace\r\n  intervals.]\r\n\r\n    [176] In Germany called “Column of Platoons.”\r\n\r\n    [177] In columns of fours, at 6-pace intervals.\r\n\r\nAccording to the figure, the Italian Company Column (German Column of\r\nPlatoons) suffers the greatest losses; the least losses are sustained\r\nby the company formed in line of platoons, each in route column, at\r\nintervals of 15 paces. According to French experiments, this formation\r\nis said to be no longer suitable when subjected to infantry fire at\r\nranges under 1300 m.\r\n\r\nAccording to French firing tests made in Châlons,[178] the following\r\npercentages of hits may be expected when using the Lebel rifle firing\r\nold model steel jacketed bullets:\r\n\r\n  ==========================================+===================\r\n                                            |   At a range of\r\n                                            +----+----+----+----\r\n                                            |1200|1400|1600|1800\r\n                                            | m. | m. | m. | m.\r\n  ------------------------------------------+----+----+----+----\r\n  Platoon (one rank)                        | 4.4| 3.4| 2.2| 1.4\r\n  Skirmish line, men at 3-pace intervals    | 1.2|----|----|----\r\n  Platoon in column of fours                | 6.6| 3.8| 2.2| 1.3\r\n  Platoon in column of twos                 | 5.6| 3.2| 1.9| 1.1\r\n  Company column (German column of platoons)|22.0|18.0|14.0|10.0\r\n  ------------------------------------------+----+----+----+----\r\n\r\n    [178] _Le Joindre, Petit Guide pour les tirs collectifs_, p. 15.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General ROHNE, in his work, _Schieszlehre für die\r\nInfanterie_, p. 117, computes values for the relative vulnerability\r\nof the several formations. At a range of 1200 m., purely frontal fire\r\nonly being considered, we obtain with every 1000 rounds fired with the\r\nappropriate elevation, the following number of hits against--\r\n\r\n  ========+=====+=========+=============\r\n          |Line.|Column of|Infantry in\r\n          |     |platoons.|route column.\r\n  --------+-----+---------+-------------\r\n  Standing| 116 |   160   |     98\r\n  Prone   |  20 |    65   |     72\r\n  --------+-----+---------+-------------\r\n\r\nAnd against a company deployed in line of platoons:\r\n\r\n  =========+================+==================+===================\r\n           |3 platoons, each| 3 platoons, each |6 sections, each in\r\n           |in route column.|in column of twos.| column of twos.\r\n  ---------+----------------+------------------+-------------------\r\n  Standing |      57        |       39         |       29\r\n  Prone    |      28        |       25         |       14\r\n  ---------+----------------+------------------+-------------------\r\n\r\nThe company deployed in line of sections in columns of twos would thus\r\nseem to be the most favorable formation for movements, and the line\r\nlying prone is especially well suited for halts. For movements under\r\npurely frontal, concentrated fire, the line is the least favorable\r\nformation, while the route column offers the narrowest target. In\r\nthis, the character of the terrain plays a decisive role. In firing\r\non targets consisting of columns, it has been assumed that a single\r\nprojectile will place only one man out of action. Under shrapnel fire\r\nthe formations are similarly arranged as regards their vulnerability,\r\nthe line formation being less favorable than the column of platoons,\r\nsince the former receives all bullets deflected laterally.\r\n\r\nThe total losses in battles and more serious engagements amount to from\r\n10 to 20% of the participating troops. In some organizations the losses\r\nin killed and wounded may amount to as much as 50-60%. The loss that an\r\norganization will endure is directly proportional to its efficiency.\r\nGood troops, which unexpectedly get into a difficult situation (as,\r\nfor example, the British Brigade of Highlanders at Magersfontain), and\r\nwhich have been trained to look upon heavy losses as unavoidable, will\r\nbe capable of enduring a loss of 25% in the course of a battle without\r\ngoing to pieces and without discontinuing the attack.[179]\r\n\r\n    [179] It is notorious that colonial wars with their moderate losses\r\n  spoil troops and their leaders in this respect.\r\n\r\n  At the battle of =Gravelotte=, in which 166,400 rifles, 21,200\r\n  sabres, and 732 guns, extending over a front of 19 km., participated\r\n  on the German side, only 109,200 rifles and 628 guns fought the\r\n  decisive action. The losses amounted to 9.51%, distributed as\r\n  follows: 899 officers and 19,260 men; according to arms: infantry,\r\n  10.96%; cavalry, 0.66%, and artillery, 5.74%. On the decisive flank,\r\n  the infantry of the Guard suffered a loss of almost 30%. On this\r\n  flank, the Rifles of the Guard (_Gardeschützen_) lost 44%, the 1st\r\n  Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Guard, 55.5% of their enlisted\r\n  strength, the 6th Company of the latter regiment losing even 141 men.\r\n\r\n  Although losses are, generally speaking, smaller than during the\r\n  18th Century, and at the opening of the 19th Century, nevertheless\r\n  they may amount to a considerable figure in a brief space of time in\r\n  single bodies of troops which suddenly encounter a heavy fire.\r\n\r\n  At =Magersfontain=, (December 11th, 1899) the British lost 13% of\r\n  their total strength; the Brigade of Highlanders, 23% (39% of the\r\n  officers; i.e., 1 officer for every 14.9 men); the IInd Battalion\r\n  of the Black Watch, 42%, and the IInd Battalion of the Seaforth\r\n  Highlanders, 23.9%. At =Colenso= (Dec. 15th, 1899) the British lost\r\n  6.4% of their total strength; the IInd Battalion of the Royal Dublin\r\n  Fusiliers, 23.9%.\r\n\r\n=Spionskop= (Jan. 24th, 1900):\r\n\r\n  Attacking troops  2,694 men in 18¹⁄₂ hrs. 40 officers, 721 men = 28.2%\r\n  Supports          1,600  „  „  10¹⁄₂  „    8   „        95  „  =  6.4%\r\n  Reserves          1,500  „  „   4¹⁄₂  „   15   „       170  „  = 12.3%\r\n  Staffs             ----        ----        5   „       ---        ----\r\n                    ----------------------------------------------------\r\n                    5,794 men               68 officers, 986 men = 17.5%\r\n\r\n  This action illustrates strikingly how rapidly the officers directing\r\n  the fire were shot down.\r\n\r\n  Attacking troops  1 officer for every 18 men\r\n  Supports          1   „     „     „   12  „\r\n  Reserves          1   „     „     „   11  „\r\n                    --------------------------\r\n                    1 officer for every 14 men\r\n\r\n  For the purpose of comparison, we should like to mention that the\r\n  Prussian Grenadier Battalion “_von Wedel_,” consisting of 12 officers\r\n  and 390 men, lost 10 officers and 301 men (77%) in about one hour\r\n  during the battle of =Soor= (Sept. 30th, 1745). The losses suffered\r\n  by the Grenadier Battalion “_von Münchow_” at =Kesselsdorf= are\r\n  possibly not much lower. The effective strength of the last named\r\n  battalion is not given; it lost 5 officers and 371 men.[180]\r\n\r\n    [180] _Kriege Friedrichs des Groszen_, II, Appendix 3, pp. 11 and\r\n  47.\r\n\r\n  At =Kolin=, the Grenadier Battalion “_Nymschöfsky_” lost 652 men,\r\n  and six infantry regiments lost between 900 and 1188 men, _i.e._,\r\n  considerably more than 50% of their strength. Two days after the\r\n  battle, the Grenadier Battalion “_Nymschöfsky_” numbered only 24\r\n  men and the enlisted strength of six infantry regiments was 233,\r\n  296, 602, 651 and 711 men respectively. The number of stragglers was\r\n  undoubtedly very great.[181] At =Kolin=, the infantry lost in all\r\n  12,307 men out of 19,000, _i.e._, 65%.\r\n\r\n    [181] _Ibid._, III. Appendix, pp. 11 and 20.\r\n\r\nThe losses among officers are especially heavy. This is by no means\r\ndue to the attempt of the hostile skirmishers to pick off the leaders\r\nin the combat at short range, but to the fact that, in order to lead\r\ntheir men, officers must expose themselves. This becomes more and more\r\nnecessary the greater the moral effect of the combat on the nervous\r\nsystems of the men, and the poorer the troops. According to past\r\nexperience, the casualties among officers are especially heavy in the\r\nearly stages of a war.[182]\r\n\r\n    [182] See _Taktik_, V, pp. 81, 88 and 358.\r\n\r\n  The relative losses of officers and men in the battles named are\r\n  given, in round figures, in the following table:\r\n\r\n  At =Weiszenburg (Vth Army Corps)=    1 officer for every 14   men;\r\n  „  =Wörth (Vth Army Corps)=          1    „     „    „   20    „ ;\r\n  „  =Wörth (XIth Army Corps)=         1    „     „    „   15    „ ;\r\n  „  =Vionville (IIIrd Army Corps)=    1    „     „    „   21    „ ;\r\n  „  =Vionville (Xth Army Corps)=      1    „     „    „   24    „ ;\r\n  „  =Gravelotte (Guard Corps)=        1    „     „    „   22.5  „ ;\r\n  „  =Gravelotte (XIIth Army Corps)=   1    „     „    „   20    „ ;\r\n  „  =Colenso=                         1    „     „    „   15    „ ;\r\n  „  =Magersfontain=                   1    „     „    „   11.8  „ ;\r\n\r\n  Colonel HESSERT[183] writes the following in regard to the losses\r\n  among the officers of the 25th Division on August 18th, 1870: “Eight\r\n  of the 16 field officers and 6 of the 14 adjutants present with\r\n  the regiments and battalions were either wounded or killed. Almost\r\n  all of these officers were mounted. Seventeen of the 40 company\r\n  commanders--almost all of them dismounted--and 43 of the 151 company\r\n  officers were placed out of action. This would be a loss of 50% in\r\n  field officers, 42% in adjutants, 37% in company commanders, and 29%\r\n  in company officers.”\r\n\r\n    [183] _Betrachtungen über die Leistungen der französischen Gewehre\r\n  M/74 und M/66_, Darmstadt, 1879, p. 115.\r\n\r\n  On this day the Rifle Battalion of the Guard lost 100% of its\r\n  officers and 44% of its men--19 officers and 431 men, in about\r\n  three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\n  On Sept. 11th, 1877, at =Plevna=, the _Ugla_ Regiment lost 20 of its\r\n  officers, _i.e._, 40%; the _Jaroslaw_ Regiment, 25 officers, _i.e._,\r\n  64%; the total loss of the first named regiment amounted to 42%,\r\n  that of the last named to 49%. Of the 15 company commanders of the\r\n  _Vladimir_ Regiment, 14 were placed out of action.\r\n\r\n  After the assault on the =Tuminling Pass= on Oct. 12th, 1905, the\r\n  East Siberian Rifle Regiment had only 2 officers with its firing\r\n  line, and after the battle of =Sandepu= only 5. These examples are\r\n  not isolated ones. After the battle on the =Yalu=, the 11th Rifle\r\n  Regiment had present for duty only one field officer, and the 12th\r\n  only 3 captains. On March 7th, 1905, the _Yoshihoka_ Regiment (3rd\r\n  Japanese Division) had present for duty only 3 lieutenants; one\r\n  battalion was commanded by a first sergeant and one company by a\r\n  private.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. THE MORAL EFFECT OF FIRE.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect may make itself felt in a two-fold way: as the sum of\r\nthe impressions influencing the soldier at all times in action, and\r\nas the momentary general impression produced by a sudden considerable\r\nincrease in the losses. The great material effect of fire creates such\r\na consciousness of danger in men’s minds that in a defeated force more\r\nthan half of its numbers succumb to this moral effect of the fire.\r\n\r\n“Troops do not retreat because they are unable to maintain themselves\r\nowing to their numerical inferiority, but because they fear the losses\r\nwhich they would suffer if they advanced further. The determination\r\nto conquer has been overcome by the desire to live. The confusion of\r\nimpressions increases with the size of the force. Taken individually,\r\nthe men might behave quite sensibly, but in a crowd they are claimed\r\neither by insanity or lethargy. The activity of the mind is completely\r\nreplaced by imagination; everything is believed; nothing is appraised;\r\nexaggeration prevails everywhere; and precipitation produces unthought\r\nof results. When the men come to their senses, it is as if they were\r\nawakened from a stupor; they are unable to understand how fear could\r\nhave induced them to do the very opposite from that which would, most\r\nsurely, have saved them from destruction.”[184]\r\n\r\n    [184] KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den\r\n  Russisch-Türkischen Krieg_, I, p. 150.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the impressions of the battle of St. Privat, General\r\nvon Kessel wrote: “The men appear to be either extraordinarily excited\r\nor stupefied. Their faces are distorted and only a few still retain\r\nfirm will power.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Bonnal describes his first impressions at the battle of\r\nWörth as follows: “Since half-past seven our battalion was lying,\r\nfacing eastward, in the neighborhood of the wood of Fröschweiler. The\r\nshrieking of the Prussian shells, but especially the noise of the\r\nshells bursting in the midst of the batteries of the 3rd Division\r\nin position in our rear, made a considerable impression on our men.\r\nTheir joking ceased, and nervousness was plainly visible in their pale\r\nfaces. Men to whom tobacco was offered declined it; they had no desire\r\nto smoke. All eyes were focused upon the officers. The latter were\r\ncongregated here and there in small groups; a few were trying hard to\r\njoke, others were walking up and down, with a cigarette between their\r\nlips, making convulsive efforts to appear at ease; a small number\r\nwere entirely calm as if no danger was present.... The first batch of\r\nwounded made a strong impression. The battalion was to reinforce the\r\nTurcos in the edge of the wood of Fröschweiler. The fire of the Turcos\r\ndrowned all other sounds. There was nothing to indicate that the enemy\r\nwas also concentrating a heavy fire upon the wood. We deployed into\r\nline to the right. The deployment began, but scarcely ten men had\r\nreached the edge of the wood when a terrible cracking and rattling\r\ncommenced. It was a mitrailleuse battery which fired a volley directly\r\nunder our very noses. At this moment our men lost their heads. They\r\nblazed away like mad, crowded in three, four, and five ranks at the\r\nfoot of the downward slope. The men in front had thrown themselves to\r\nthe ground, the others fired kneeling or standing, leaning against\r\ntrees. Since all of the men fired without aiming, enveloped moreover\r\nby a dense, impenetrable cloud of smoke, the advanced lines were in\r\ngreater danger of being hit by French bullets than by those of the\r\nenemy. We had to throw ourselves to the ground to avoid being shot down\r\nby the lines in rear. On the hill opposite to us, at a range of 300 to\r\n400 m., there rested a white smoke cloud, and we could indistinctly\r\ndiscern the enemy, who was keeping up a lively fire. The powder smoke\r\nenveloping us was so dense that we literally could not breathe.” This\r\nexcitement gradually subsided and the leaders were able to get the\r\ntroops again under control.\r\n\r\nThe numerous surrenders of British troops in the engagements of\r\nthe Boer War were due to the peculiar conditions existing in the\r\ntheater of war. Besides, Boer and Briton spoke the same language.\r\nDuring the first few days of the campaign, surrenders of detachments\r\nof considerable strength took place. These were not punished with\r\nsufficient severity. One almost gains the impression that the men\r\nconsidered the surrenders justifiable in order to escape from a\r\ndifficult situation.\r\n\r\nOn the South African battlefields, devoid of cover and swept for\r\ngreat distances by the hostile fire, it was indeed very difficult\r\nto penetrate the hostile position, and retrograde movements were\r\nundoubtedly attended with heavy losses. To this may be added the fact\r\nthat it was easy for the Boers, who were mounted, to bar the way to\r\nisolated British forces. It must be remembered, moreover, that the\r\noperations took place during the hottest season and in a country where\r\nwater is scarce; and that the men felt they had arrived at the limit\r\nof their powers of physical endurance at an earlier moment than would\r\nhave been the case under different conditions. Thus, the surrender at\r\nStromberg of troops exhausted from a night march, is perhaps excusable;\r\nnot so, however, the surrender of Colonel Carleton’s detachment,\r\nwhich laid down its arms at Nicholson’s Neck after offering a feeble\r\nresistance. In the last-mentioned case, it is true, several Englishmen,\r\nwho had already laid down their arms, stood among the Boers so that the\r\ncommander of the British force did not really know just what action to\r\ntake in this situation. His hesitation decided his fate. The demand\r\nmust unquestionably be made in future also,[185] that troops surrounded\r\nin the field make a serious attempt to cut their way out before\r\npermitting thoughts of surrender to enter their minds.\r\n\r\n    [185] In contrast to this view the British court of inquiry found\r\n  all but three of the 226 surrenders, which occurred up to June 1st,\r\n  1900, justified. In the three cases in which the verdict was adverse\r\n  only a few men had surrendered. Within a period of eight months\r\n  the British lost a total of 1680 officers and 2124 men killed and\r\n  wounded, while their loss in prisoners amounted to 182 officers and\r\n  4984 men.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine theoretically what losses troops are\r\nable to endure. After the Franco-German War it was believed that\r\ntroops had reached the limit of endurance after losing one-third to\r\none-fourth of their strength. Nowadays this limit would appear to be\r\nreached much sooner. It may be pointed out, however, that the neglect\r\nof continuing the attack at Colenso (loss 5.8%), and at Spionskop (loss\r\n7.2%), may, in part, be charged to lack of energy in the commander;\r\nand that the Brigade of Highlanders, consisting of 2000 rifles and\r\ndeployed on a front of about 4000 m., in the engagement at Paardeberg\r\n(loss 13.4%), lacked the necessary depth to continue the attack.\r\nThe greater the degree of efficiency and freshness of troops, and\r\nthe less the degree of suddenness with which they enter a difficult\r\nsituation, the greater the losses which they will be capable of\r\nenduring. Furthermore, we should not forget that our modern personnel\r\nhas become much more susceptible to the impressions of battle. The\r\nsteadily improving standards of living tend to increase the instinct\r\nof self-preservation and to diminish the spirit of self-sacrifice.\r\nThe spirit of the times looks upon war as an avoidable evil, and this\r\nmilitates directly against that courage which has a contempt for death.\r\nThe fast manner of living at the present day undermines the nervous\r\nsystem,[186] the fanaticism and the religious and national enthusiasm\r\nof a bygone age are lacking, and, finally, the physical powers of the\r\nhuman species are also partly diminishing. The influence exerted by\r\nofficers on the firing line is nowadays, however, considerably smaller\r\nthan in the past, so much so that they can actually control only the\r\nnearest skirmishers. In addition, the nerve-racking impressions on the\r\nbattlefield are much greater at present than in the past. The “_void\r\nof the battlefield_”[187] has become especially pronounced since the\r\nintroduction of smokeless powder. “_The invisibility of the enemy\r\ndirectly affects the morale of the soldier, the sources of his energy\r\nand his courage. The soldier who cannot see his enemy, is inclined\r\nto see him everywhere. It is but a step from this impression to\r\nhesitancy and then to fear._ The inertia of the troops for whole days\r\nat Magersfontain, Colenso, and Paardeberg, frequently more than 800\r\nm. from the enemy, was not produced by their losses, but by the moral\r\ndepression which is caused within the effective zone of rifle fire.”\r\n(General NÉGRIER.)[188]\r\n\r\n    [186] See SPAITS, _Mit Kasaken durch die Mandschurei_. After the\r\n  author had turned away in disgust from a Chinese execution, he wrote:\r\n  “And we Europeans will feel just like this in war. We will get to a\r\n  certain point where the strength of our will and our physical powers\r\n  will succumb to the weakness of our nerves, and this state we will\r\n  reach more quickly than did the Russians, who were better off in\r\n  regard to nerves than members of those armies in which nervousness is\r\n  carefully fostered.” See also this author’s remarks about _Courage_,\r\n  _ibid._, p. 206.\r\n\r\n    [187] This complaint of the “void of the battlefield” is not\r\n  new. A Saxon officer complains of it in his _Vertrauten Briefen_\r\n  (Cologne, 1807), and the French officers report on the “void of the\r\n  battlefield” in the fights around Metz. BONNAL, _L’art nouveau en\r\n  Tactique_, p. 90.\r\n\r\n    [188] _Revue des deux mondes_, for June, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe effect of danger on the battlefield is indicated by--\r\n\r\n  1. Derangement of tactical units;\r\n\r\n  2. The mixing of men of the different units during the action; and\r\n\r\n  3. The dissolution of units into disorderly masses.\r\n\r\n  According to the _History of the Kaiser Franz Regiment_ (p. 113)\r\n  immediately after the battle of =St. Privat=, most of the companies\r\n  numbered only 30 men, and the whole regiment only 340 men, although,\r\n  allowing for losses, there should have been 1922 men. The three\r\n  companies of the 39th Füsilier Regiment which had fought in the\r\n  =Stiring Wald= at =Spicheren=, numbered only 6 officers and 150\r\n  men at the close of the fight in the evening,[189] which means\r\n  that, allowing for losses, 350 men were missing. After the battle\r\n  of =Colombey=, when the Füsilier Battalion of the 55th Regiment\r\n  was assembled, three companies numbered only 120, 60 and 40 men,\r\n  respectively. This battalion had lost about 300 men.[190]\r\n\r\n    [189] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 366.\r\n\r\n    [190] _Geschichte des Regiments_, p. 347.\r\n\r\n  The plan of the battle of Colombey given in the General Staff Account\r\n  (_Gt. St. W._) shows at 7 P. M. 17 companies belonging to 5 different\r\n  infantry regiments, and to two different infantry brigades, occupying\r\n  a front of 1200 paces, in the following order:\r\n\r\n    7.       1.   4.    8.    4.    6.    12.   7.   }\r\n  -------, ----, ----, ----, ----, ----, ----, ----, }\r\n  Jägers.   55.   15.   15.   53.  15.    15.   15.  }\r\n\r\n  { 10. 11. 12.    1.    1.   9.10.   4.3.

Inf.\r\n\r\n  At =Wörth= 17 different regiments were represented on a front of 5700\r\n  paces.\r\n\r\n  “The assault on =Elsaszhausen= (=Wörth=), after preliminary forest\r\n  fighting, mixed up the troops of the different brigades and in some\r\n  cases caused the dissolution of battalions.... The 44th Brigade was\r\n  the only one that remained in fairly good order. Abreast and in rear\r\n  of it were portions of all the other regiments (of the XIth Army\r\n  Corps) which, at the moment, however, represented no actual reserves.\r\n  Even the battalions in the first line hardly appeared to be tactical\r\n  entities.”[191]\r\n\r\n    [191] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 268.\r\n\r\n  At several points it was possible to assemble the stragglers into\r\n  formed bodies; but the men in these, commanded by strange officers,\r\n  easily succumbed to the influences of the combat, and the units\r\n  disintegrated rather quickly as soon as they came under fire.[192]\r\n\r\n    [192] For details see KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, XVI,\r\n  pp. 122, 124, 177, 231-234.\r\n\r\n  In the =Giefert Wald= (=Spicheren=) out of 32 companies (4\r\n  brigades) only four companies fought together as a battalion. In\r\n  the little =Wenzelberg Wood= (at =Nachod=) there were engaged 7¹⁄₂\r\n  Austrian battalions (belonging to four different regiments) and 2\r\n  Jäger-Battalions, all of these troops belonging to three different\r\n  brigades.[193] No attempt was made to lead these troops as one body.\r\n\r\n    [193] _Austrian Gen. St. W._, 1866, III, p. 81.\r\n\r\n  In the oak wood at =Dubno= (=Skalitz=), there were engaged 12¹⁄₂\r\n  and 8¹⁄₂ battalions belonging to four different regiments and to\r\n  two different army corps. “The Prussian orders led to a breaking up\r\n  of the order of battle and to a considerable mixing of brigades,\r\n  regiments and battalions. In consequence of this, control was lost to\r\n  a certain extent by the commander-in-chief, and the result achieved\r\n  was mainly due to the skill and intelligence of the subordinate\r\n  leaders--especially that of the commanders of battalions and half\r\n  battalions.”[194]\r\n\r\n    [194] KÜHNE, _Kritische Wanderungen_, II, p. 48.\r\n\r\n  “The wooded region in rear of =St. Hubert= was thickly infested with\r\n  stragglers of all arms. White, red, and blue shoulder straps were to\r\n  be seen in profusion; men with and without rifles; some with helmets,\r\n  some with caps, some bareheaded. There were no officers present\r\n  except those stretched wounded upon the ground. The superior officers\r\n  riding through the valley assembled the men they found, but it proved\r\n  only a small force that they gathered, for the greater portion of\r\n  the men were safely ensconced to one side of the bottom of the\r\n  valley.”[195] “At 5 P. M., the garrison of =St. Hubert= had increased\r\n  to 43 companies, belonging to seven different regiments, and the\r\n  result was utterly hopeless confusion.”[196]\r\n\r\n    [195] HÖNIG, _Vierundzwanzig Stunden Moltkescher Strategie_, p. 139.\r\n\r\n    [196] _Ibid._, p. 167.\r\n\r\n  “At 10 P. M., 48 battalions of the VIIth, VIIIth and IInd Corps\r\n  occupied a space of barely 1500 m. front and a depth of 1000 m., east\r\n  of the Mance ravine opposite the French position. Fortunately the\r\n  enemy was so exhausted that we were able to commit the most serious\r\n  mistakes with impunity under the very muzzles of his rifles.”[197]\r\n\r\n    [197] _Ibid._, p. 224.\r\n\r\n  “At =Sedan= bodies of infantry of the XIth Corps, as well as of the\r\n  46th Infantry and of the 5th Jäger-Battalion, had gotten mixed up\r\n  with the 43rd Brigade during the course of the battle. The regiments\r\n  of the 43rd Brigade had likewise been so disorganized that after the\r\n  capture of =Cazal= the brigade commander had nothing at his disposal\r\n  but the most heterogeneous mass of troops consisting of about a\r\n  battalion.”[198]\r\n\r\n    [198] _Gen. St. W._, II, p. 1249.\r\n\r\n  “In penetrating into =Lovtcha= (1877) the foremost battalions became\r\n  disorganized. The companies, and even single soldiers, stood around\r\n  in irregular groups on the streets, crowded into the houses and\r\n  sought cover in drainage ditches.”[199] “In one battalion of the\r\n  _Kasan_ Regiment, which was to move through the town from the left\r\n  flank, officers and men threw themselves down when the enemy’s fire\r\n  became effective and only with difficulty could they be induced to\r\n  rise. When the regimental commander fell, everybody fled, carrying\r\n  along those in rear. Only two company columns, composed of stragglers\r\n  of different organizations, resisted, deployed into a dense skirmish\r\n  line and, encouraged by their officers, rushed forward cheering.”[200]\r\n\r\n    [199] KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den\r\n  Russich-Türkischen Krieg_, I, pp. 68 and 72.\r\n\r\n    [200] _Ibid._, I, p. 72.\r\n\r\n  This fighting power of improvised units, when there were officers\r\n  left to lead them, was displayed on several occasions at =Plevna=.\r\n\r\n  The IInd and IIIrd Battalions of the _Kaluga_ Regiment (in the third\r\n  battle of =Plevna=) after taking the second crest, thoughtlessly\r\n  continued the advance in complete disorder.\r\n\r\n  “Skobeleff foresaw the coming reverse and attempted to form a\r\n  reserve, but only by dint of the greatest exertions on the part of\r\n  the officers was it possible to collect about 100 men belonging\r\n  to various companies. The men of the IInd and IIIrd Battalions of\r\n  the Kaluga Regiment were scattered all over the battlefield, the\r\n  companies had become completely mixed up, and it was a matter of the\r\n  greatest difficulty to re-form them.”[201]\r\n\r\n    [201] _Ibid._, I, p. 154.\r\n\r\n  “Dense firing lines, composed of men of all the regiments,\r\n  attempted to climb the opposite slope but they got only half way;\r\n  400 paces from the Turkish works they halted. The survivors of the\r\n  organizations participating in the action gradually assembled in\r\n  Work No. 1, which had been taken. While only a couple of hundred men\r\n  had taken the work, thousands were now assembled there. Not a single\r\n  company or battalion was intact, every vestige of organization had\r\n  disappeared; the commanders, and officers generally, had become\r\n  separated from their units.”[202]\r\n\r\n    [202] _Ibid._, I, pp. 236 and 238.\r\n\r\n  “Prince IMERETINSKI succeeded in forming stragglers into the\r\n  following improvised units:\r\n\r\n  3    provisional companies of the _Libau_   Regiment.\r\n  2         „          „      „  „  _Susdal_      „\r\n  2¹⁄₂      „          „      „  „  _Vladimir_    „\r\n  1    detachment of 100 men of the _Reval_ Regiment.\r\n\r\n  “These re-formed stragglers were despatched to Skobeleff’s assistance\r\n  and made a successful assault on Work No. 2 from Work No. 1.”[203]\r\n\r\n    [203] _Ibid._, I, p. 243.\r\n\r\n  “These stragglers subsequently formed the nucleus of the garrison of\r\n  Work No. 2. During the night of the 11/12 September, the Russians\r\n  succeeded in gathering 1000 more men, which were assembled in\r\n  companies irrespective of the regiments to which they originally\r\n  belonged. This gathering of stragglers lasted, by the way, up to the\r\n  afternoon of the 12th of September. The continuance of the fight was\r\n  made possible only by constantly re-forming the remnants into new\r\n  organizations and then sending these forward into the fight.”[204]\r\n\r\n    [204] _Ibid._, I, p. 258.\r\n\r\nThe remedies provided by the regulations against these evils are,\r\nabove all else: Restriction of the front of the several units, the\r\ndeployment of tactical units side by side in action (instead of in rear\r\nof each other) and the use of every opportunity for re-establishing\r\nthe original organizations. Other suggestions for stemming the tide\r\nof disorder as made by the author of _Summer Nights Dream_ (1888)\r\n(platoons formed in single rank, volley firing, and constant closing\r\ntoward the center) are impracticable in a serious action. The\r\ndisintegrating effect of a battle is stronger than tactical cohesion.\r\nIt is better to recognize this fact than to face the enemy with\r\nillusory ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to train the men in peace time to follow willingly any\r\nofficer, whether he belong to their own or to another organization;\r\nand, for that reason, exercises in provisional organizations are\r\nrequisite for tactical training--a large number of officers being told\r\nto fall out at these exercises to assimilate losses which would occur\r\nin action. The control of mixed firing lines by word of command of\r\nan officer is the foundation of order and troop leading, and thus a\r\nprerequisite of success in the battles of the future. In a successful\r\nengagement, the evils above mentioned are less evident than during a\r\nreverse when troops unexpectedly suffer heavy losses or receive fire\r\nfrom the flank or rear. Troops formed into well-organized units can\r\nwell stand such a test, but in an improvised organization, composed\r\nof fractions and men of different units, especially when their own\r\nofficers are absent, such a crisis may lead to panic.\r\n\r\n  The following battle episode is very instructive: The 1st Battalion,\r\n  4th Infantry, deployed in line of company columns, advanced at\r\n  =Colombey= (14th August, 1870) under French shell and _Chassepot_\r\n  fire. The morale of the 3rd Company was visibly impaired by two\r\n  shells which burst, one after the other, in its ranks, placing 15-20\r\n  men out of action. “The men began to hesitate; their steps grew\r\n  shorter; and, as if impelled by an invisible power, the company\r\n  executed a half right turn, another half right turn, then another\r\n  and another. One would have thought the movement was being executed\r\n  at command. The column was now facing to the rear, and although\r\n  not running, not fleeing, it was moving back to the Brasserie with\r\n  suspiciously lengthening steps. The drummer, one Borchert, did\r\n  everything to bring the men to their senses; the non-commissioned\r\n  officers assisted bravely, but in vain; the column continued its\r\n  movement to the rear. Filled with shame and indignation, the\r\n  perspiration pouring out of every pore, I shouted to the men,\r\n  repeatedly commanding: ‘Company ... Forward!’ But all in vain. At\r\n  that moment the battalion commander--he was called the ‘marble\r\n  statue’ on account of his coolness--galloped up on his bay, shouting:\r\n  ‘Look at the 5th Company over yonder; see how far it has advanced.’\r\n  Then another superior officer jumped in front of the men with the\r\n  words: ‘Is there no officer here at all?’ At this instant I yelled\r\n  again as if my life depended upon it: ‘You men belong to the color\r\n  company; Company ... Forward!’ and the spell was broken. As if on\r\n  the parade ground the Grenadiers faced to the front; obediently they\r\n  executed my command: ‘To the attack! Carry arms ... Forward!’ and\r\n  soon thereafter we again occupied our position between the 2nd and\r\n  4th Companies.”\r\n\r\n  The company lost many men as soon as it entered the fight, among them\r\n  its company commander; then the two shells burst in rapid succession\r\n  within its ranks, and this explains the temporary panic. The company\r\n  lost a total of 86 men (including officers).[205]\r\n\r\n    [205] RETZLAFF, _Aus meinem Tagebuch_.\r\n\r\nNothing is more contagious in the zone of danger than the example\r\nof fear or cowardice.[206] Appeals, threats, and intimidation are\r\nof little avail. The most effective remedy lies in developing the\r\nindividual soldier’s initiative, in training him to act with common\r\nsense even when his officers are absent. We should send our soldiers\r\ninto battle with a reserve of moral courage great enough to prevent the\r\npremature moral and mental depreciation of the individual.\r\n\r\n    [206] Some interesting proofs in support of this statement are:\r\n\r\n    The attack made by Captain Bechtoldsheim at Custozza against\r\n  Italian infantry. _Oesterreichs Kämpfe_, II, p. 74.\r\n\r\n    The combats at the Mance ravine on Aug. 18th, 1870.\r\n\r\n    HÖNIG, _Vierundzwanzig Stunden Moltkescher Strategie_, pp. 170,\r\n  184, 193 and 215.\r\n\r\n    _Sedan_, _Gen.

NORMAL PROCEDURE.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic tendency of modern times is the liberation of the\r\nindividual from antiquated ideas and from the restraint exercised\r\nby ostensibly reactionary governmental power. The key-note of this\r\ntendency, which places individualism above collectivism, is absolute\r\nindependence of the individual in municipal and national affairs, in\r\nscience and art. Even tactics has been influenced to a certain extent\r\nby this tendency. Success in battle, however, will not be assured by\r\nthe sum-total of a number of negative or positive individual efforts,\r\nbut only by the simultaneous launching of masses controlled by a\r\nsingle will. Within these limits the independence of the individual is\r\npermissible, for a commander does not exact apathetic obedience, but,\r\non the contrary, intelligent coöperation on the part of everyone, and\r\nthis cannot be regulated by hard and fast rules.\r\n\r\nInstead of laying down rules to cover all cases, the German Drill\r\nRegulations leave the leader free to dispose of his troops according to\r\nthe purpose of the combat and the nature of the ground. In this he is\r\nassisted by the initiative and independent action of his subordinate\r\nleaders. Normal formations for attack and defense are requisite\r\nhowever, in armies in which the tactical training of commanders and\r\nsubordinate leaders is deficient and where it is feared that the latter\r\nwill abuse the latitude allowed them. Where such normal formations\r\nare prescribed, it is assumed that hard and fast rules are requisite\r\nfor training; that the average officer cannot be expected to estimate\r\na situation correctly and arrive at proper decisions; and that the\r\nmajority of them must be given definite rules for combat if they are\r\nto render any service at all.\r\n\r\nDrill regulations should facilitate quick mutual understanding between\r\nleader and organization and lay down general principles for ordinary\r\nsituations, for combat tasks, and for formations, but should not, by\r\ntheir rules, direct the actions of a leader from the very beginning\r\ninto definite grooves. If the regulations contain a normal procedure,\r\nthere is danger that it will be employed where inappropriate, and that\r\nthe mental alertness of the leaders will relax and fail in war at the\r\nvery moment when its presence is most vitally necessary.[207]\r\n\r\n    [207] “Leaders who have been trained only in the mechanical part of\r\n  drill and who subsequently have to act independently, fare like the\r\n  lame man deprived of his crutches, or the near-sighted man deprived\r\n  of his spectacles.” VON SEIDLITZ.\r\n\r\n“Tactics will always vary according to the nature of the ground,\r\ntherefore it is impossible to tell beforehand what might happen in each\r\nparticular case.” (FREDERICK THE GREAT). Whether or not a particular\r\nnormal procedure is appropriate does not depend upon the terrain but\r\nsolely upon the tactical situation.[208]\r\n\r\n    [208] It is only in cases where precisely identical situations\r\n  may be presumed to exist that there can be any question of a normal\r\n  procedure. The last stages of the infantry attack in fortress\r\n  warfare present features of this nature and on that account a normal\r\n  procedure has been formulated for it in almost all of the European\r\n  armies.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable unanimity of opinion as to the general\r\nmanner of carrying out an attack, opinions differ radically as to\r\ndetails. “If all the advocates of a normal attack had to describe\r\nit in words, there would be about as many suggestions as there are\r\nadvocates. Which of the many normal attack schemes is the most\r\nsuitable for average troops? A conference called for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating this point would probably have the strange result that\r\neach representative would concede that what the others desire is\r\npracticable but need not be done.”[209] Anyone who thinks himself\r\ncapable of evolving a normal procedure, should bear in mind that\r\nall such systems have invariably failed to fulfill the expectations\r\nentertained for them because of obstacles which could not have been\r\nforeseen during their preparation. Regulations that prescribe too many\r\ndetails are very apt to lead to stereotyped forms and to that which\r\ncannot stand the test of actual war. So far every war has had surprises\r\nin store for the troops and this will be equally true in the future.\r\nTroops will be able to find a way out of such situations only if they\r\nhave been taught to follow the spirit rather than the letter of their\r\nregulations, if they have been individually trained and accustomed to\r\nstrict discipline, and if their leaders have been taught to reflect on\r\ntactics. It is better to send troops into battle with the order, “Help\r\nyourselves as best you can,” than to encumber them with combat rules of\r\ndoubtful value which leave them in the lurch at the first opportunity,\r\nbecause the troops have not been taught to depend upon their own\r\ninitiative. The consequent indecision is increased in the same\r\nproportion as the faith the troops and their leaders had in the lauded\r\nuniversal remedy, the normal procedure. In spite of the excellence of\r\nour regulations, we should accustom ourselves to the idea that a future\r\nwar may correct their provisions.[210]\r\n\r\n    [209] General BRONSART V. SCHELLENDORFF, _I, Betrachtungen_, etc.\r\n  p. 42\r\n\r\n    _British Drill Regulations_: “Although a normal attack is\r\n  apparently capable of being changed to suit the various situations,\r\n  the continual practice of it leads to a stereotyped formation, to\r\n  lack of skill and mobility. The disadvantages coupled with a normal\r\n  attack are not apparent in time of peace, but in war they will make\r\n  themselves felt through losses and failures.”\r\n\r\n    [210] Major VON HÜLSEN, _Schema oder Selbständigkeit?_, (Berlin,\r\n  1906).\r\n\r\nThe enunciation of certain technical combat principles as a guide in\r\nthe training of the troops is, however, far removed from laying down\r\na stereotyped form for attack (normal attack). Every thinking officer\r\nwill anyhow, consciously or unconsciously, formulate in his own mind\r\nsome sort of a “normal attack”, which is nothing but a firm opinion\r\nof how he thinks an attack ought to be carried out. If such combat\r\nregulations are called “drill attack” (_Schulangriff_), many of the\r\nobjections advanced against the normal attack are eliminated. Such\r\ndefinite provisions facilitate in a great measure the intercourse\r\nbetween leader and troops.\r\n\r\n  “Instructions as to what to do in battle,” says Clausewitz (_On\r\n  War_, II), “must not be taken for more than they are; they should\r\n  not be regarded as hard and fast rules or systems, but merely as\r\n  good general forms which individual judgment can utilize as is most\r\n  suitable.... By means of a uniform method, commanders attain skill,\r\n  precision, and confidence, the possession of which qualities on their\r\n  part will make the whole machine run easier....\r\n\r\n  “The drawback is that the habit of acting in a certain groove tends\r\n  to become fixed and thus antiquated while the attendant circumstances\r\n  imperceptibly change, and this should be prevented by enlightened and\r\n  thorough criticism. When, in the year 1806, the Prussian generals\r\n  (Prince Louis at =Saalfeld=; Tauenzien on the =Dornberg= at =Jena=;\r\n  Grawert in front of and Rüchel in rear of =Kapellendorf=) without\r\n  exception came to grief by employing Frederick the Great’s system\r\n  of tactics, it was due not merely to the fact that they had gotten\r\n  into a certain groove of acting which was out of date, but to the\r\n  most dire poverty of resource to which a fixed system of tactics has\r\n  ever led. Owing to this incapacity of thinking for themselves, they\r\n  involved Hohenlohe’s army in such ruin as has never before or since\r\n  overtaken any army on the battlefield.”\r\n\r\n  General von Boguslawski[211] demands that the conduct of the attack\r\n  be regulated by precise instructions both on the drill-ground and in\r\n  action. He states: “The many different methods of dealing with even\r\n  the simplest cases, unquestionably evident in the army at the present\r\n  time, are an evil calculated not only to train but also to confuse\r\n  the soldier and the subordinate leader. Precise regulations are by\r\n  no means incompatible with adaptation to the varying features of the\r\n  terrain in a given case, and will infuse unity and certainty into\r\n  offensive movements. A normal formation must be prescribed, but it\r\n  should be flexible.”\r\n\r\n    [211] _Taktische Darlegungen_, p. 51.\r\n\r\n  Elsewhere he makes the following statement in regard to a normal\r\n  attack: “I believe that the normal attack should be regarded as the\r\n  basis of troop training--a solid foundation for further development.\r\n  In carrying out the spirit of this procedure, further work should be\r\n  done on varied ground. This spirit aims at the unity of the attack.\r\n  The formations taught on the drill-ground should be retained as\r\n  long as possible. The training of officers and men must be such,\r\n  however, that they will deviate, whenever necessary, from these\r\n  normal formations. But if the formations, as well as the training\r\n  and drill, are truly practical and adapted for war, departures from\r\n  the scheme laid down in the regulations will be insignificant. This,\r\n  briefly, is my idea of the normal attack or uniform procedure, which\r\n  not only does not have a detrimental effect, but, on the contrary, is\r\n  absolutely necessary in order to facilitate the work of the higher\r\n  leader.”\r\n\r\n  General von Scherff states:[212]\r\n\r\n  “It would contribute to clearness and to proper division of\r\n  responsibility if the regulations would definitely prescribe:--\r\n\r\n  “1. That only the superior commander who makes dispositions for\r\n  battle according to his own judgment, be charged with assigning\r\n  appropriate missions;\r\n\r\n  “2. That the subordinate leader, charged with the execution of\r\n  a mission, determine, by an independent choice of any expedient\r\n  provided by the regulations, the formation in which his organization\r\n  is to carry out the task assigned; and, finally,\r\n\r\n  “3. That the subsequent conduct of such an organization be governed\r\n  by a definite normal procedure, familiar to the men from the\r\n  drill-ground, so as to ensure mutual coöperation of its component\r\n  parts.”\r\n\r\n    [212] _Einheitsangriff oder individualisierter Angriff_, Berlin,\r\n  1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CONCENTRATION, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEPLOYMENT FOR ACTION.[213]\r\n\r\n    [213] _Aufmarsch_, _Entfaltung_, _Entwicklung_.\r\n\r\nColumn tactics, which influenced us even after the Franco-German\r\nwar, required that troops be concentrated, prior to an action, from\r\nthe narrow route column into a broad combat formation. This tedious\r\nsystematic =concentration=[214] was invariably employed before\r\nentering an action, except when, in critical situations, companies\r\nand battalions had to be launched into the fight directly from route\r\ncolumn. The commander of a force could reduce the time required for\r\ngoing into action only by approaching the field of battle in assembly\r\nformation.[215]\r\n\r\n    [214] “By _concentration_ is meant the passage from route column to\r\n  a broader close order formation. It is employed for the purpose of\r\n  decreasing the depth of a column and for assembly.” (Par. 315 German\r\n  I. D. R.)\r\n\r\n    [215] Examples: The approach of the IInd Army to the battlefield of\r\n  Gravelotte, see _Taktik_, III, p. 305.\r\n\r\n    The advance of the 1st Army from its cantonments toward the\r\n  Bistrits to the battlefield of Königgrätz was a mistake. The\r\n  army first approached in route columns, then concentrated, again\r\n  formed route columns, and finally concentrated for action. V.\r\n  LETTOW-VORBECK, II, pp. 407 and 480. From what I know of the terrain\r\n  the advance should in this case have been made in assembly formations.\r\n\r\nValuable time was thus lost. Even when the situation was not pressing,\r\nthe leader was obliged, for example, to allow a regiment having a depth\r\nof 1200 m. to close up to a depth of 100 paces. When this had been\r\ndone, he was forced to wait until thin skirmish lines gained a proper\r\ndistance to the front. The rear elements were able to follow only\r\nwhen the skirmishers had gained a distance approximately equal to the\r\nformer depth of the entire column. Such a concentration is only proper\r\nhowever, when the commander wishes to launch his troops subsequently in\r\nseveral directions. Advantage should be taken of every opportunity for\r\ndecreasing the depth of the column (by forming column of sections).\r\n\r\nThe advance of large bodies of troops presents no difficulties even in\r\nclose country, if, as recommended by the author,[216] the battalions in\r\nroute column are placed abreast of each other and are permitted to go\r\naround obstacles and take advantage of the cover available. However,\r\neven at long ranges, troops in such formations present favorable\r\ntargets to hostile machine guns and artillery.\r\n\r\n    [216] See _Taktik_, III, p. 307.\r\n\r\n  The British were surprised in close order formations at\r\n  =Magersfontain= and =Colenso=. In subsequent engagements, in order\r\n  to avoid this, their infantry, when still a great distance away from\r\n  the enemy, took up an attack formation which permitted only movements\r\n  directly to the front (at =Poplar Grove,= for example, this was\r\n  done when 10 km. from the enemy). An advance in such a formation\r\n  was possible only because the plains of South Africa presented no\r\n  obstacles, and because the British had only to hold the enemy who\r\n  stood passively on the defensive. Each brigade formed its four\r\n  battalions into an open double column with a front of 2000 and a\r\n  depth of 800 m., the distances and intervals between battalions being\r\n  300-400 m. Each battalion deployed from this column so that its eight\r\n  companies, each in a thin line (with 2 and finally 20 pace intervals\r\n  between the men), followed each other at a distance of 100-120 paces.\r\n  The advantage of having troops in hand so that they can be used in\r\n  other directions than straight to the front, had disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =The Formation of a Brigade of Four Battalions of the\r\n6th Infantry Division=\r\n\r\nduring the advance on =Poplar Grove= on March 7th, 1900. Front about\r\n800 m., depth, 1800-2000 m.]\r\n\r\nWhen an engagement is expected, the different elements, each in route\r\ncolumn, are directed upon their several objectives, i.e., the column\r\nis _developed for action_. This is done because it is necessary to\r\ngain a start over the enemy in deployment and advantageous to move\r\nin route column. Thus a =development for action= (_Entfaltung_)[217]\r\nis nothing but an extension of front accomplished by breaking up the\r\noriginal route column into a number of separate columns. The latter\r\nmarch on diverging lines and can generally remain in route column.\r\nDeep column should not be formed unless an immediate extension is not\r\nanticipated. During the development for action, preparations should be\r\nmade providing for the necessary depth of the combat formation.\r\n\r\n    [217] The German I. D. R. make a distinction between extension of\r\n  front, “development for action” (_Entfaltung_, pars. 315 and 466),\r\n  and “distribution in depth” (_Gliedern_, pars. 287-291 and 427). The\r\n  term “to form for attack” (_Auseinanderziehen_, par. 241), means that\r\n  troops are given a combat formation both as regards frontage and\r\n  depth.\r\n\r\nWhen the necessity for engaging can be foreseen, the concentration into\r\nan assembly formation should be avoided, since it generally entails a\r\nloss of time and energy, and the development for action chosen instead.\r\n(Par. 315 German I. D. R.). The latter has the additional advantage\r\nof affording a higher degree of readiness for action without letting\r\nthe troops get out of hand. It should be practiced not only from route\r\ncolumn but also from assembly formation.[218]\r\n\r\n    [218] See the defeat of the Russian Reserve Brigade under Orlov\r\n  on September 2nd, 1904, at Liao Yang, in _Angriffsverfahren der\r\n  Japaner_, by von Lüttwitz.\r\n\r\nThe development for action should begin as soon as there is danger of\r\ngetting under effective artillery fire. The length of time required for\r\ngoing into action may be reduced by shortening the route column (by\r\nconcentrating the troops into deep column); by forming several route\r\ncolumns abreast, unless column of sections has already been formed; by\r\nclearing the roads of troops; by marching across country; by indicating\r\nbeforehand on which side of the infantry the artillery is to be\r\nbrought up (pars. 315-323 German I. D. R.); and, finally, by directing\r\nthe heads of the various elements upon their respective objectives.\r\n(Development for action).\r\n\r\n  In the Austrian regulations, the development for action is not\r\n  so clearly emphasized: “A concentration preceding the attack in\r\n  rencontres is permissible in only those exceptional cases when it\r\n  becomes apparent, during the preparatory stage of the action, that\r\n  the enemy has a visible start in deployment.” When time is not\r\n  pressing, the regulations prescribe a concentration for action and,\r\n  simultaneously therewith, such a grouping of the principal units (if\r\n  possible out of range of the effective fire of hostile guns, and\r\n  well concealed) that the attacking troops need move only straight to\r\n  the front. A more extended formation is taken up when the zone of\r\n  hostile artillery fire is reached. The march to the battlefield is\r\n  discussed in detail by the French regulations: In the first place,\r\n  in order to take advantage of cover and to keep the roads clear for\r\n  artillery, it will be necessary to leave the road and to advance\r\n  across country. This will, as a rule, result in widening the front\r\n  of the advancing force, even though this be only to the extent of\r\n  placing columns abreast of each other. Hourly halts are to be made,\r\n  so as to give an opportunity for replenishing ammunition and time for\r\n  reconnaissance. Small columns are preferred in woods and in close\r\n  country and larger columns on passable ground. Attention is specially\r\n  called to the danger to which troops are exposed when surprised in\r\n  defiles by hostile fire. This march to the battlefield is followed by\r\n  a concentration of the troops in concealed and protected positions.\r\n\r\nThe =deployment for action= (_Entwicklung_) consists of forming the\r\ntroops for battle and includes the extension into line of skirmishers.\r\nAs a rule, the deployment follows the development for action, but may\r\nbe made directly from route column or from an assembly formation.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to define clearly where the development for action\r\nceases and where the deployment begins. The formation of a line of\r\nskirmishers to cover a route column does not constitute a deployment.\r\nThere is no room for doubt that the regulations have in mind the\r\nrencontre, in which the passage from route column to skirmish line\r\nproceeds naturally and smoothly. In attacking an enemy prepared to\r\ndefend a position, the procedure is much more cautious. In this case\r\nthe force which has been developed for action is withdrawn as much\r\nas possible from the view and the fire of the enemy (par. 367 German\r\nI. D. R.), and led forward from cover to cover. (Par. 369 German I.\r\nD. R.). Even in situations in which haste is required, it is a good\r\nplan to follow the procedure laid down by the regulations, viz: “First\r\ndirect the troops upon the proper objective, then give them a suitable\r\nformation.”\r\n\r\n  An analysis of the question as to whether an immediate launching\r\n  of troops into action is necessary (5th Infantry Division at\r\n  =Vionville=) or whether they should first be regularly concentrated\r\n  (6th Infantry Division at =Vionville=) is of special interest. The\r\n  concentration of the 1st Prussian Army Corps at =Waterloo=, and\r\n  of the 5th Bavarian Infantry Brigade at =Nehweiler= (=Wörth=),\r\n  almost in rear of the French, is justly criticised. At =Nachod=,\r\n  the Austrian brigades, owing to their time-consuming concentration,\r\n  lost an opportunity of throwing the weak Prussian advanced troops\r\n  from the heights south of Wysokow, while the latter were reinforced\r\n  by parts of the main body which arrived by half-battalions. This\r\n  reinforcement, while made in driblets, was, however, sufficient.\r\n\r\n  During its march to the battlefield of =Gravelotte=, the 3rd Infantry\r\n  Division concentrated at Buxieres for the purpose of cooking. Then\r\n  it formed again in route column, concentrated once more south of\r\n  Rezonville, and from there moved on in echelon formation. The\r\n  concentration of the 28th Infantry Brigade on August 6th, 1870\r\n  (=Spicheren=), was still less justifiable. About noon, when the head\r\n  of the brigade reached the exit of the Kollertal Wood at Raschpfuhl,\r\n  it received orders to cross the Saar. Upon receiving this order, the\r\n  five battalions present concentrated, unfurled their flags and then\r\n  marched across country to the railroad bridge of Mattstall. In order\r\n  to effect a crossing, route column had to be formed again. The delays\r\n  which occurred here led the parts of the force which had crossed\r\n  first, to throw themselves into the fight.[219]\r\n\r\n    [219] _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 77_, p. 51.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE BATTALION, THE REGIMENT, AND THE BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nWhen part of a larger force, the battalion may be broken up into\r\ncompanies either by directing the latter upon their respective\r\nobjectives, or by forming for attack by command.\r\n\r\nWhen forming for attack by command, the front, the base company,\r\nintervals, distances, and the relation of the companies to each other\r\nmust be indicated. The intervals should be sufficiently large to permit\r\nthe companies to move unhampered, and so maintained that irregularities\r\nof marching will not be communicated from one to the other.\r\n\r\nA space approximately equal to the front of a platoon will suffice\r\nfor this purpose. Thus the interval between companies at war strength\r\nwould be 150 paces, and between companies at peace strength 100 paces.\r\nIntervals may be increased or diminished when necessary so as to enable\r\nthe troops to take the fullest advantage of cover. The same holds true\r\nfor distances. For rules in regard to the distance between the second\r\nand first line, see p. 121, supra. When a battalion has formed line\r\nof companies at long range from the enemy for the purpose of reducing\r\nthe effect of the hostile fire, distances should be diminished to\r\nfacilitate the transmission of orders.\r\n\r\nWhen the battalion is acting alone, the intervals depend upon the\r\npurpose of the combat. In the fights around Mukden, some of the\r\nJapanese battalions, stationed at points where the decision was not\r\nsought, were each assigned a front of 800 m. In these cases the four\r\ncompanies of each battalion had to be deployed abreast of each other at\r\nlarge intervals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to prescribe fixed forms of deployment for particular\r\nsituations. In each case the formation of the battalion depends upon\r\nthe situation, the purpose of the combat, and the nature of the ground,\r\nthe battalion commander having the option of going into action in one,\r\ntwo, or three lines.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the formation depends upon whether--\r\n\r\n1. The battalion is acting alone or as part of a larger force; and\r\nwhether one or both of its flanks are resting on impassable obstacles;\r\n\r\n2. Whether it is fighting a decisive or a containing action; whether it\r\nis to attack or to stand on the defensive;\r\n\r\n3. Whether it is to prepare the attack by its own fire or is to take\r\nadvantage of the preparation effected by other troops; and, finally,\r\n\r\n4. Whether or not it has to fight at night.\r\n\r\n=A battalion acting alone=, whose flanks are not resting on natural\r\nobstacles, will, as a rule, place entire companies successively into\r\naction so as to retain complete organizations for other purposes. It\r\nwill seldom be proper for the battalion to form for attack in the\r\nregular manner. When this can be done the battalion should form in\r\nthree lines in conformity with its task of initiating, carrying out,\r\nand deciding the fight. In this case the leading company is reinforced\r\nby the second company as soon as the situation has become sufficiently\r\nclear. More frequently, the battalion commander will send only a single\r\ncompany into action, retaining the others for the time being under\r\ncover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe =advance guard battalion= of a regiment will, as a rule, be\r\ncompelled to develop considerable fire in a _rencontre_ (par. 357\r\nGerman I. D. R.), in order to check the advance of the enemy,\r\nand for this purpose it will frequently place two companies into\r\naction at once. But since the battalion commander cannot count upon\r\nreinforcements and, moreover, as he does not know on which flank the\r\ncombat is subsequently going to develop, he will provisionally retain\r\nthe other two companies in rear of the center, or echelon them in rear\r\nof both flanks. (See “a” and “b” above figure).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn a =containing action= one should endeavor to employ few rifles\r\nbut, on the other hand, expend much ammunition, and keep supports and\r\nreserves far in rear so as to minimize the losses. If the force is to\r\ndeploy first of all only for fire action, but is later to participate\r\nin the decisive attack, it will be advisable to place two companies in\r\nthe first line, one in the second, and one in the third. The companies\r\nin the second and third lines will then be less exposed to hostile\r\nfire, and the battalion commander will be able, by first launching one\r\nand then the other company, to exercise an influence on the course of\r\nthe action during a longer period than would otherwise be possible.\r\n(See “b”).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=When a battalion is fighting as part of a larger force=, and when\r\nboth its flanks are secure, it will need only supports for feeding\r\nthe frontal attack (par. 289 German I. D. R.) and can cover a greater\r\nfront. A reserve may either be entirely dispensed with, or made very\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nWhen only one flank of the battalion is secure, the threatened flank\r\nshould be protected by echeloning the supports and the reserve in\r\nrear of it. In this position, these echelons are not so apt to be\r\nbullet-stops as when they are placed in rear of the center. Besides,\r\nthey can more easily execute enveloping movements and can take a\r\nhostile flank attack in flank. When both flanks are in the air, only\r\nthe most essential precautions should be taken on the one flank, while\r\non the other everything available is united for the decisive attack.\r\n\r\nIn =defense=, three companies can sometimes be taken into the first\r\nline for the purpose of developing a strong fire, while the fourth\r\ncompany is held in rear of a threatened flank or in rear of the center.\r\n(See “d”). When it is desired to employ the reserve offensively, only\r\none or two companies are placed in the first line, the others being\r\nheld in reserve in rear of the flank which is to take the offensive.\r\nInterval and distance increase with the size of this reserve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen a battalion from the reserve is called upon to make an immediate\r\nattack which has been prepared by the fire of other troops, all its\r\ncompanies may be taken at once into the first line. In this case\r\nthe battalion may be formed for attack with its companies at close\r\nintervals. This might also be a suitable combat formation for night\r\noperations. All these formations are subject to change however, as soon\r\nas the proper utilization of cover makes it necessary.\r\n\r\nThe general principles stated for a battalion are also applicable to a\r\n=regiment=. The regiment may either be directly formed for attack, or\r\nthe heads of the battalions may be deflected toward the points where\r\nthe deployment is to take place. An interval of 300-400 m. between\r\nheads of battalions is best calculated to facilitate the subsequent\r\ndeployment. The distances depend upon the nature of the ground and the\r\npurpose of the combat.\r\n\r\nThe regimental commander assigns tasks to his battalion commanders, but\r\nleaves the latter entire freedom of action in regard to the formation\r\nto be taken up and the manner of deploying. He should interfere with\r\ncompanies only in exceptional cases. Such interference is justified\r\nonly when the conduct of subordinate leaders threatens to impair unity\r\nof action in the combat and when time is lacking to observe the proper\r\nchannels in communicating an order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Methods of Forming a Battalion for Attack.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn developing the =brigade=[220] for action, the depth of column\r\nbegins to exert an influence. Every concentration of the brigade\r\nretards its entry into action. If the longest distance to be covered\r\nin developing the brigade is assigned to the leading element of the\r\ncolumn, the march into action will be accelerated.\r\n\r\n    [220] For historical references in regard to the importance in\r\n  action of the brigade, see essay published in _Jahrbücher für\r\n  Armee und Marine_ (August-September number of 1877) entitled, _Die\r\n  Infanterie-Brigade in ihrer Entwicklung aus der Brigade von 1812_. In\r\n  regard to the employment of the regiments in line or in echelon, see\r\n  MOLTKE, _Kritische Aufsätze sur Geschichte des Feldzuges von 1866_.\r\n  MOLTKE’S _Taktisch-Strategische Aufsätze_, p. 99, et seq.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen an infantry brigade approaching the battlefield is to prolong the\r\nflank of the fighting line, its entry into action might be hastened,\r\nperhaps, by letting the rear regiment continue the march in the\r\noriginal direction while the leading regiment takes the longer route.\r\nThe rear regiment would then be abreast of the leading one after about\r\n15 minutes. If the battalions are subsequently developed on radiating\r\nlines, the development of the whole force will, after a few minutes,\r\nhave progressed far enough to permit a deployment of skirmishers.\r\n\r\nWhen the brigade takes up a combat formation, each regiment is assigned\r\na separate task (attack of a point, or defense of a section). If the\r\ntasks assigned are definite and harmonize with each other, mutual\r\ncoöperation will be assured. The brigade commander ordinarily sends his\r\norders to the regimental commanders, but, when circumstances (haste,\r\ncorrection of errors) compel him to depart from this rule, he should\r\ninform those officers of the action taken. In a brigade consisting of\r\ntwo regiments, its commander, in order to be able to influence the\r\naction, will be compelled to retain at least one battalion as a reserve.\r\n\r\nBrigades of three regiments[221] (each of three battalions) have an\r\nadvantage in this respect. But if such an increase in infantry units\r\nwere contemplated, it would be better, for reasons that will be given\r\nlater on,[222] to form the additional troops into a third division in\r\neach army corps.\r\n\r\n    [221] The British division consists of twelve battalions formed\r\n  into three brigades.\r\n\r\n    In the United States the three unit organization is most clearly\r\n  marked. The division consists of three brigades, each brigade\r\n  of three regiments, and each regiment of three battalions. The\r\n  battalions have a strength of only 400 men.\r\n\r\n    [222] _Taktik_ (_Kriegsgliederung_), III, p. 31, et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\nBase Units.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of regulating the movements of a body of troops by\r\nmeans of a base unit, depends upon a number of preliminary conditions\r\nwhich will seldom be fulfilled in war:\r\n\r\n1. _The leader of the base unit would have to remain unharmed to the\r\nvery last._ If he were disabled the command of the unit would devolve\r\nupon the next in rank who would perhaps not join it in every case.\r\n\r\n2. _The fresh organisation which imparts the impetus necessary for\r\na further advance, would have to maintain the direction after the\r\noriginal base unit had ceased to exist on account of the mixing of\r\norganizations._\r\n\r\n3. _The base unit would have to encounter less difficulties during\r\nits advance than the other units of the force._ If the base unit were\r\nto encounter greater difficulties than the other units, this might\r\nserve as an excuse for reducing the rate of advance. In attack, the\r\norganization nearest the enemy, in other words, the one that is led\r\nbetter and more energetically than the others, is quite naturally\r\ncharged with maintaining the direction. Moreover, this organization\r\nwill be able to facilitate by its fire the advance of the elements in\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nThe designation of a base unit[223] or unit of direction on the\r\nbattlefield cripples the energy of an entire line and the initiative of\r\nthe individual in favor of uniformity of movement. A base unit is only\r\nprofitable in night operations, in crossing unfavorable ground (woods),\r\nand in bringing the fighting line up to the effective zone of hostile\r\nfire. “With the entry into action, the importance of the base company\r\ngradually decreases as the demands made by the combat increase”. (Par.\r\n242 German I. D. R.). In all other cases, it is better to indicate\r\neither the objective on which the troops are to march, or the flank\r\ntoward which they are to maintain connection.\r\n\r\n    [223] “A unit may also be designated upon which the others have\r\n  to regulate their movements without thereby being curbed in their\r\n  endeavor to advance (base unit of combat).” (Par. 371 German I. D. R.)\r\n\r\n    In France units of direction are prescribed (_la direction est\r\n  confidée aux unités qui suivent les chemins ou les lignes naturelles\r\n  du terrain_), but their duties are not given in detail. Units of\r\n  direction are also prescribed in Austria.\r\n\r\nA _change of direction_ of march is executed by wheeling or turning\r\nwith the subordinate units toward the new front. (Par. 185 German\r\nI. D. R.). A _change of front_ is effected in the same manner. With\r\nlong lines, echeloning and movements by the flank will result, which\r\ncan only be rectified gradually by issuing appropriate orders. When\r\nskirmishers have been deployed in a wrong direction, or when a\r\ndeployment in another direction becomes necessary after the conclusion\r\nof a combat, it is advisable to deploy a new line in the desired\r\ndirection, from the closed bodies still available, and to withdraw, at\r\nthe same time, those parts of the former skirmish line which are no\r\nlonger necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of Changes of Front.\r\n\r\n  1. Engagement at =Helmstedt=, on July 25th, 1866. The 20th Infantry\r\n  had to deploy to its left rear after its successful attack on the\r\n  Ütting Hill.[224]\r\n\r\n    [224] _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 20_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n  2. The battalions of the XIth Army Corps wheeling toward the\r\n  =Niederwald= after crossing the Sauer (battle of =Wörth=).[225]\r\n\r\n    [225] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 254, sketch p. 262.\r\n\r\n  3. The wheel executed by Kottwitz’ Brigade during the battle of\r\n  =Loigny-Poupry= (2nd Dec., 1870). (This is also cited as an example\r\n  of the conduct of a counter-attack made by the defender). Toward noon\r\n  the advance guard of the 17th Infantry Division held =Lumeau=. The\r\n  33rd Brigade, its battalions in double column, was concentrated south\r\n  of =Champdoux=. The division commander retained two battalions as a\r\n  reserve and ordered Major-General von Kottwitz “to execute a quarter\r\n  wheel to the right and to form his command for attack in the general\r\n  direction of Loigny,” for the purpose of relieving the pressure on\r\n  the Bavarians defending =Schlosz Goury=. The attack was directed\r\n  against the French Division Jauréguiberry, which was attacking\r\n  Schlosz Goury. This division first came under fire at 3-400 m. and\r\n  then approached to within about 150 m. of the defenders’ position;\r\n  strong reserves followed in rear of its right flank, but otherwise\r\n  nothing was done to protect the right.\r\n\r\n  By wheeling at once to the right, the right wing of Kottwitz’ Brigade\r\n  would still have struck the eastern garden wall of Schlosz Goury,\r\n  and, as Loigny had been indicated to the general as the objective, a\r\n  fan-shaped extension of the brigade, precluding mutual coöperation,\r\n  would have been unavoidable. The general had fourteen companies\r\n  at his disposal and decided to advance in a southerly direction\r\n  until his second line overlapped the most advanced hostile line, so\r\n  that the attack as planned would have struck simultaneously both\r\n  the first and second lines of the enemy. The slight loss of time\r\n  involved caused the general no uneasiness, as he could carry out\r\n  his intentions without interference beyond range of the fire of the\r\n  enemy, whom he could observe during the entire movement. The brigade\r\n  formed for attack, during its movement to the south, when about 1200\r\n  m. from Goury. The general, who was on the right flank, halted the\r\n  brigade after it had advanced far enough, and wheeled it to the right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  As the second line overlapped the first, the Füsilier Battalion of\r\n  the 76th Infantry had to shorten its step until the 2nd and 3rd\r\n  Companies of the same regiment had come abreast and until the 6th\r\n  and 8th Companies of the 75th Infantry had also joined the line. The\r\n  center half-battalion, (2nd and 3rd Companies of the 76th Infantry),\r\n  the unit of direction, was ordered to march on the church spire of\r\n  Loigny. All the units of the force, with the exception of the IInd\r\n  Battalion, 76th Infantry, at once deployed lines of skirmishers. The\r\n  1st and 4th Companies, 76th Infantry, and 5th Company, 75th Infantry,\r\n  covered the left flank and turned toward Ecuillon. Of the eleven\r\n  companies launched in this flank attack, six were in the first line\r\n  (approximately 1100 rifles on a front of 800 m.), and five in the\r\n  second.\r\n\r\n  The bulk of the second line, in an endeavor to close with the enemy\r\n  quickly, joined the firing line when 400 m. from the enemy. The\r\n  attack came as a complete surprise to the French; their lines were\r\n  taken in flank, and all their attempts to form new defensive lines to\r\n  oppose the onslaught of the Hansards proved unavailing. The dense,\r\n  unwieldy masses of the French were more and more crowded together by\r\n  the uninterrupted advance of the Hansards and offered good objectives\r\n  to the German marksmen. The advance of the brigade was supported by\r\n  the artillery in position near Lumeau. This artillery followed the\r\n  brigade to Ecuillon.\r\n\r\n  The Hansards traversed a distance of 3500 m. during this attack. The\r\n  right wing and the bulk of the 2nd and 3rd Companies, 76th Infantry,\r\n  which had been detailed as the unit of direction, with orders to\r\n  march on the church spire of Loigny, strayed to Fougon; the left wing\r\n  penetrated into Loigny.[226]\r\n\r\n    [226] See HÖNIG, _Volkskrieg_, IV, p. 80; also KUNZ, _Loigny_, p.\r\n  105.\r\n\r\n  4.

DISTRIBUTION IN DEPTH AND FRONTAGE OF COMBAT FORMATIONS.[228]\r\n\r\n    [228] See _Taktik_, V, _Gefechtslehre_, p. 38.\r\n\r\nThe infantry combat is decided by the combined action of long firing\r\nlines. Retained forces, not launched against the enemy for the purpose\r\nof crushing him, exert no influence whatever on the decision, since\r\nthey only increase losses without contributing to the fire effect. In\r\nthe battles of the past, distribution in depth at the decisive stage of\r\nthe combat (unless necessary as a measure of precaution, in securing\r\nthe flanks, for example), was only permissible so long as the short\r\nrange of the weapons allowed reserves to be kept in readiness so close\r\nto the firing line that they could assault _en masse_ at once and\r\nwithout any diminution of their strength. The deciding factor, which\r\nrested in retained reserves during the Napoleonic era, lies at present\r\nin the firing line.[229]\r\n\r\n    [229] The French still entertain a contrary opinion.\r\n\r\n=Distribution in depth= _is, therefore, only a means to an end; an\r\nexpedient made use of to maintain a dense firing line permanently at a\r\nconstant strength; to give the firing line the impetus for the assault;\r\nto protect it against a reverse; and to secure its flanks. Victory\r\nis assured only by the simultaneous employment of superior fighting\r\nforces. A force should go into action in a deep combat formation, but\r\nit must extend its front during the fight._ To launch an insufficient\r\nnumber of troops for combat and to reinforce them gradually is a\r\nfatal error, as we are thereby compelled to fight a superior force\r\ncontinually with an inferior one, without being able to take advantage\r\nof the superiority which we may actually possess.\r\n\r\n  The Russian attacks in the battles around =Plevna= are very\r\n  instructive in this respect. On July 30th, 1877, the =Grivica=\r\n  intrenchments were attacked by two columns consisting of nine\r\n  battalions. The Ist and IInd Battalions of the 121st Infantry\r\n  succeeded in reaching the trench, but then the attack failed. The\r\n  IIIrd Battalion then attacked, with a similar result Thereupon the\r\n  IInd and IIIrd Battalions of the 123rd Infantry were launched, but\r\n  these also only succeeded in reaching the edge of the ditch of the\r\n  trench. The attack of the left column proceeded in a similar manner,\r\n  likewise that made by the reserves. An attack made simultaneously by\r\n  the entire force undoubtedly would have been successful.[230]\r\n\r\n    [230] _Russisch-Türkischer Krieg_ (_Gen. St. W._), German\r\n  Translation, III, pp. 254 and 264.\r\n\r\n  On September 11th, 1877, after the attack made by the 63rd and 117th\r\n  Infantry Regiments on the =Omar Bey Tabia= had been repulsed, the\r\n  64th and 118th Infantry Regiments of the IVth Army Corps, and the\r\n  31st Infantry Division of the IXth Army Corps (the last mentioned\r\n  force was not under the orders of the commander of the IVth Army\r\n  Corps) were placed in readiness for a renewed attack at 3 P. M. In\r\n  spite of the heavy losses (42 and 49%) and the fact that the failure\r\n  of the first attack had demonstrated that such a small force was\r\n  insufficient for taking the Turkish work, only two regiments were\r\n  again sent forward to the attack (in other words, 6 battalions\r\n  instead of 18). When this assault had also been repulsed, and\r\n  one regiment from the reserve had in addition been thrown in, 6\r\n  battalions of the 15 still intact, were again sent forward, but they\r\n  likewise failed to take the work. A regiment began its attack only\r\n  when the preceding one had been repulsed with loss. The 24 battalions\r\n  lost 115 officers and 4319 men. A timely reinforcement by troops in\r\n  reserve would have averted a reverse at any rate, and a simultaneous\r\n  employment of adequate forces would have assured the success of the\r\n  Russian infantry.[231]\r\n\r\n    [231] KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den\r\n  Russisch-Türkischen Krieg_, I, p. 211.\r\n\r\n  The same thing occurred at =Gorni-Dubniac=. As the Russians, who\r\n  advanced on a broad front, did not attack simultaneously, the weak\r\n  garrison of the trenches was able to concentrate its fire on the\r\n  isolated attacking groups which followed each other.\r\n\r\n  The same peculiar feature, namely, small frontage with insufficient\r\n  fire power and strong reserves, was frequently observed during the\r\n  battles in the =Russo-Japanese war=. On the left flank, at =Wafangu=\r\n  (15th June, 1904), the 1st East Siberian Rifle Division advanced\r\n  with one battalion of the 2nd Regiment and one of the 3rd in the\r\n  first line, with four battalions in the second line, and with three\r\n  battalions of the 1st Regiment in the third line. A full development\r\n  of the fire power of the division did not take place at all.[232] The\r\n  2nd and 3rd Regiments, in all about 6000 men, lost 49 officers and\r\n  1464 men. The 1¹⁄₂ batteries attached to the division were shot to\r\n  pieces in a short time and fell into the hands of the Japanese.\r\n\r\n    [232] LÖFFLER, _Russisch-Japanischer Krieg_, I, p. 56.\r\n\r\nDistribution in depth is necessary during the preparatory stage of the\r\nfight, as it enables the commander to meet unexpected developments in\r\nthe situation. Moreover, it is justifiable so long as the information\r\nin regard to the strength and intentions of the enemy is insufficient.\r\nWhen reconnaissance work is not thoroughly performed, the force may\r\nbe obliged to deploy in a direction other than the one originally\r\nchosen. This will be difficult to do as changes of front and movements\r\nby the flank can only be made when the front is narrow. Moreover,\r\nafter a force is once deployed within the zone of hostile fire, it is\r\ncommitted to the direction chosen and can only move straight to the\r\nfront. Considerable changes of front can only be executed by the lines\r\nin rear. The troops held in rear are to reinforce the firing line and\r\nto increase its density to the maximum at the decisive moment. As the\r\nlosses are smaller in defense than in attack, a force can cover a\r\nbroader front and keep its supports in closer proximity to the firing\r\nline in the former than in the latter case, especially if it was able\r\nto strengthen its position. The reserve, however, should be kept at a\r\ngreater distance from the firing line than in attack, in order that it\r\nmay retain complete freedom of movement--in covering the retreat, or in\r\nmaking a counter-attack--and may not be involved in the fire fight.\r\n\r\nThe reserves of the attacker are to protect the flanks, give the\r\nimpetus for the assault, serve as a force upon which the attacking line\r\ncan rally, and cover the re-forming of the troops after a successful\r\nattack. The several echelons of the attack formation, except the small\r\nfractions immediately supporting the firing line[233] and covering\r\nits flanks, should have become merged with that line by the time the\r\ndecisive moment of the combat arrives. The commander who takes up an\r\nunnecessarily deep attack formation dispenses with an advantage; on\r\nthe other hand, the one who prematurely deploys in force, exposes\r\nhimself to grave danger. _The troops should be sent into action in a\r\ndeep combat formation, since the firing line is to be fed from the rear\r\nuntil the decisive moment arrives, but every available man should be\r\nthrown in for the assault._\r\n\r\n    [233] The advantage of having such supporting forces in rear of the\r\n  line is clearly shown in the fights of the 18th Brigade at Wörth.\r\n  KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 14, pp. 110, 129 and 172.\r\n\r\n=Distribution in depth and frontage= are interdependent; the greater\r\nthe frontage, the less the distribution in depth, and vice versa. In\r\nevery deployment for action the following question awaits solution\r\nby the troop leader: “How deep ought the formation to be and how\r\ngreat an extension of front is allowable.” The result of the combat\r\ndepends in many cases upon a happy answer to this question. Broad\r\ncombat formations have great initial energy, facilitate turning and\r\nflank movements, but their energy is not constant when the means are\r\nnot available to replace casualties. In addition, the difficulty of\r\nleading, the danger of the line being penetrated, and the weakness\r\nof the flanks grow apace with the extension of front. Distribution\r\nin depth makes it possible to initiate the combat with a part of the\r\nforce and to get information of the situation; to fight the action\r\nwith another part of the force in accordance with this information;\r\nand, finally, to bring about the decision and reap the fruits of that\r\ndecision with the third part. A deep combat formation enables the\r\nleader to exercise a constant influence on the course of action; it\r\ngives him the means with which to execute turning movements or to\r\nrepulse them--something which would be entirely impossible, or, at any\r\nrate, only possible under great difficulties, with troops deployed in\r\nthe first line. As only a limited number of rifles can be brought into\r\nplay in a deep combat formation, it is obvious that this is an element\r\nof weakness of which an opponent deployed on a broader front, may take\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAlthough the danger of going too far in distributing a force in depth\r\nis not inconsiderable, this is, at any rate, a smaller error than the\r\nopposite extreme, that of deploying troops, from the very start, on too\r\nbroad a front.\r\n\r\n  At noon on August 6th, 1870, General von François received an order\r\n  for his brigade to dislodge the hostile artillery posted on the\r\n  =Roten Berg= of the =Spicheren Heights=,[234] it being assumed that\r\n  only insignificant hostile forces were in front. The other brigade\r\n  of the 14th Division was expected to be able to take part in the\r\n  action in about three hours. When the attacking force was 2000 m.\r\n  from its objective, the IInd Battalion, 74th Infantry, and the IIIrd\r\n  Battalion, 39th Infantry, were set in motion against the French right\r\n  flank, while the Ist Battalion and the Füsilier Battalion of the 74th\r\n  Infantry were retained as a reserve. The brigade accordingly covered\r\n  a front of about 4000 m. While the frontal attack on the Roten Berg\r\n  was undoubtedly difficult,[235] this wide extension, which made all\r\n  leading impossible, increased the difficulties still further. In the\r\n  first place, the brigade commander led his two reserve battalions\r\n  against the Roten Berg and fell finally while leading a company. The\r\n  brigade was too weak to carry out the task imposed upon it. The 28th\r\n  Brigade, which followed, came into action at various points of the\r\n  battlefield, so that the two brigades became mixed, thus considerably\r\n  increasing the difficulties of leading. At 3 P. M., the following\r\n  troops were in the first line on the right wing:[236]\r\n\r\n   I. Bn.     II. Bn.     1. 2. and ¹⁄₂3. Cos.   4. and 1.

St. W._, I, p. 318.\r\n\r\n    [236] The units printed in heavy type belong to the 27th Brigade.\r\n  The 4th Company of the 74th Infantry was separated by 2.5 km., as the\r\n  crow flies, from the left flank of its battalion.\r\n\r\n  The following troops were in the second line:\r\n\r\n  Füsilier Bn.  2. and 3. Cos.[237]  II. Bn. and Füsilier Bn.\r\n  ------------  -------------------  ------------------------\r\n    53. Inf.         77. Inf.              77. Inf.\r\n\r\n    [237] These two companies were separated by about 1 km. from the\r\n  other companies of their battalion.\r\n\r\n  This admixture of organizations along a front of about 1.5 km. might\r\n  have been prevented by the commander. Toward 6 P. M., a similar\r\n  situation existed on the Roten Berg and at the south end of the\r\n  Giefert Wald--39²⁄₃ companies belonging to the 12th, 39th, 40th, 48th\r\n  and 74th Infantry Regiments were scattered along a front of 1600\r\n  m. It is true, the peculiar situation existing on the German side,\r\n  operated against a simultaneous employment of the several bodies and\r\n  a mixing of units was unavoidable, but it would undoubtedly have\r\n  been possible to prevent such a complete dissolution of all units,\r\n  by François’ Brigade taking up a more suitable formation before\r\n  the action commenced. The mistake made here was repeated over and\r\n  over again in the other preliminary combats of the campaign, and\r\n  invariably led to the same result.[238]\r\n\r\n    [238] Consult _Erste Gefechtsentwicklung des XI. Armeekorps bei\r\n  Wörth_, KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 13, p. 10, et seq.\r\n\r\n  The failure of the attacks made by the British brigades at\r\n  =Magersfontain= and =Paardeberg= may be traced to the lack of\r\n  sufficient reinforcements. At Magersfontain, the four battalions\r\n  of the Highland Brigade were deployed on a front of 3000 m. and at\r\n  Paardeberg on a front of 4000 m.\r\n\r\nIn deciding how many men are required to occupy or attack a position,\r\nthe principal point to be considered is the effect of fire. The\r\nmodern long range magazine rifle will, no doubt, enable us to defend\r\na position with a smaller force than was possible in the past with\r\nthe older less improved weapons. However, combats last longer\r\nnowadays, and the shock action of Frederick the Great’s tactics is\r\nno longer practicable. The fight is carried on at longer ranges, and\r\nthe tremendously costly decisive moments of the past are of rarer\r\noccurrence. As a consequence, the casualties of the whole force engaged\r\nare smaller, although, owing to unfavorable conditions, certain\r\norganizations may suffer losses quite as great as those incurred in\r\nthe battles of Frederick the Great and Napoleon.[239] Instead of the\r\nsanguinary hand-to-hand fight with cold steel, we now have a prolonged\r\nfire fight carried on by a firing line which requires to be constantly\r\nfed by troops held in rear, who have to be sheltered as much as\r\npossible from hostile fire until the moment of their employment. This\r\nfire fight is frequently decided by psychological factors and without\r\nthe troops suffering material losses.\r\n\r\n    [239] At Wörth, the 1st Turco Regiment lost the enormous total of\r\n  93.1%, and twelve other French regiments suffered a loss of over 50%.\r\n  To be sure, the losses sustained during the retreat are included\r\n  in this total. At Albuera (16th May, 1811), the 57th Regiment\r\n  (British) and the Füsilier Brigade lost 70%; in four hours the army\r\n  of Beresford lost 25%, and of the British infantry, which originally\r\n  numbered 7000 men, only 1800 remained.\r\n\r\n“The duration of the combat under modern conditions,” writes General\r\nNégrier,[240] “leads to a considerable mental exhaustion of the troops\r\nwhich is apparent in nervous lassitude. This explains the impotency\r\nof leader and troops the day after a defeat and even after a victory.\r\nThis lassitude is still greater on the day of the battle. While it\r\nis true that this has always been the case, the nervous exhaustion\r\nhas grown in an inconceivable manner, its intensity increasing at\r\nthe same rate as the invisibility of the opponent. _The invisibility\r\nof the enemy directly affects the morale of the soldier, the sources\r\nof his energy and courage. The soldier who cannot see his enemy is\r\ninclined to see him everywhere. It is but a step from this impression\r\nto hesitancy and then to fear._ The inertia of the troops for whole\r\ndays at Magersfontain, Colenso, and Paardeberg, frequently more than\r\n800 m. from the enemy, was not caused by their losses, but by the\r\nmoral depression produced within the effective zone of rifle fire.\r\nAnother factor, which governs the modern combat at short ranges, the\r\n_impossibility of the commander making his influence felt in lines\r\nwhich are seriously engaged_, is of still greater importance. _The\r\ninfluence of the officers who lead these lines is also limited. They\r\nare scarcely able to direct the three or four men nearest them._ The\r\ncombat depends upon the individual fighters, and there never has been\r\na time when the personal efficiency of the individual soldier has\r\nhad a greater significance.” We should not forget that this change\r\noccurred during a period in which we no longer fight our battles with\r\nprofessional soldiers of long service, but, on the contrary, with peace\r\ncadres of our conscript armies raised to war strength by Reservists.\r\n\r\n    [240] _Revue des deux mondes_, June number, 1902.\r\n\r\nAnother factor to be considered is the fighting quality of the\r\nopponent. In an action against an enemy who is a match for us, the\r\nnecessity for distribution in depth is, of course, greater than when\r\nfighting against poor troops.\r\n\r\n  General v. Werder could with impunity oppose the newly raised levies\r\n  of the French Republic on the =Lisaine= with 1.12 men per meter of\r\n  front. The victory was won by this very extraordinary extension of\r\n  front, which, if employed in the face of the Imperial army, would\r\n  have led to defeat.[241]\r\n\r\n    [241] KUNZ, _Entscheidungskämpfe des Korps Werder_, II, p. 11.\r\n\r\n_Considerations of importance in deciding upon the extent of front to\r\nbe covered by a force, similar conditions on both sides being presumed,\r\nare_--\r\n\r\n1. _Whether it is compelled to fight an independent action alone_;\r\n\r\n2. _Whether it is fighting, from the preparatory to the decisive stage\r\nof the combat, as part of a larger body, with at least one, or perhaps\r\nboth flanks secured_;\r\n\r\n3. _Whether it has been selected to make the decisive attack against an\r\nenemy already shaken by other troops_.\r\n\r\nIn the last mentioned case a sudden effect, a short, powerful blow,\r\nis required, and the maximum frontage of all the units employed on\r\nthe same line is admissible. But even a force advancing to the final\r\nassault can by no means dispense with distribution in depth; supports\r\nand reserves are needed to carry forward the firing line when it has\r\nbeen checked, to cover its flanks, and to carry on the pursuit (second\r\nline).\r\n\r\nThe frontage of an organization whose flanks are secure and which\r\nis acting as a part of a larger force, depends upon other troops;\r\nconsiderable extension of front is admissible provided the firing line\r\nis constantly maintained at a strength which will enable it to gain a\r\nsuperiority of fire over the enemy. “While an organization which has\r\nonly one flank protected, is less restricted as regards frontage, it\r\nwill have to provide for distribution in depth on the exposed flank.\r\nIn this case, it is a good plan to move the units held in rear toward\r\nthe particular flank (echeloning). Interval and distance increase with\r\nthe size of this echelon.” (Par. 290 German I. D. R.). The German\r\nInfantry Drill Regulations (par. 397) further emphasize the fact that,\r\nwhen well-trained infantry employs its rifles to good advantage in\r\ndefense, it is very strong in front; that it can hold a position with\r\na comparatively small force; and that, in this case, it has only one\r\nweak spot, the flank, which it must seek to protect by distribution\r\nin depth. This view is fully borne out by the recent events in South\r\nAfrica and in Manchuria. Under favorable conditions (deliberate\r\ndefense), a battalion fighting as part of a larger force may put all\r\nof its companies into the first line, a front of 200 m. being assigned\r\nto each. The battalion can thus defend a front of 800 m. The only\r\nrestriction is the requirement that the battalion commander must be\r\nable, at all times, to direct the course of the combat.\r\n\r\nAn organization acting alone which has to fight an action independently\r\nfrom beginning to end under varying conditions, cannot employ all of\r\nits available strength in the first line at one time. A distribution\r\ninto three parts, viz., firing line, supports, and reserve, is\r\ntherefore required. During the preparatory stage, the firing line\r\nshould be as weak as possible, while, for sustaining and deciding the\r\naction, the reserve should be as strong as possible. As a rule, this\r\ndistribution will not come into existence until the combat has begun;\r\nit must disappear again, during the subsequent course of the fight,\r\nthrough reinforcement of the troops that initiated the action, thus\r\nresulting in an increase of the combat front.\r\n\r\nWhile the frontage is thus increased, an equal density along the\r\nentire attacking line is not produced. This is due to the fact that\r\none will endeavor to increase the distribution in depth only at the\r\npoint where the decision is sought (offensive wings), while one will\r\nseek to obtain results by a generous expenditure of ammunition at\r\npoints where the enemy is only to be contained. When a broad front has\r\nto be held with a weak force, it is a good plan to post the troops in\r\ngroups. Of the attack as well as of the defense it may be said, that\r\nthe skillful combination of the offensive and defensive advantages of a\r\npiece of ground is a sign of good leadership. (Austerlitz). Frequently,\r\nhowever, after an action is over, the assault that penetrated a line is\r\ncalled the main attack, and the one that failed, a demonstration. An\r\norganization fighting alone will generally begin an action by deploying\r\non a narrow front; it will protect its flanks by distribution in depth;\r\nand, finally, mass troops at the decisive point in readiness to make\r\nthe assault. The force making an assault in attack or a counter-attack\r\nin defense cannot be strong enough.\r\n\r\nAnother factor that must be considered in deciding upon the frontage is\r\nthe task which a force is to perform, _i.e._, whether it is to make an\r\nattack or to stand on the defensive; whether it is to fight a delaying\r\naction or is to withdraw. The object of distribution in depth is to\r\nkeep the firing line constantly at the same strength; this requires\r\nstronger reinforcements in attack (owing to the greater losses), than\r\nin defense, and leads, consequently, to a contraction of the front.\r\n\r\nThe number of troops which will be required to hold a given piece of\r\nground must be determined separately in each case. The strength of the\r\nfighting line depends upon the effect of the hostile fire. Military\r\nhistory tells us how many troops the leader sent into action in order\r\nto gain the victory, but it seldom gives us a clue as to the number of\r\ntroops that might have sufficed in the particular case.\r\n\r\nIn deploying from route column in a rencontre, the leading battalion\r\nmay be fully engaged by the time the next one arrives on the\r\nbattlefield. In such cases, the tactical situation may require the\r\nemployment of longer firing lines than would be deemed proper for the\r\nsize of the command when making a more serious attack. (Par. 357 German\r\nI. D. R.). The assailant should then endeavor to throw the enemy, who\r\nis likewise advancing, on the defensive. The situation is similar to\r\nthat in which an advance guard has to cover the main body’s debouchment\r\nfrom a defile.\r\n\r\n  At =Nachod=, five Prussian battalions, which had only two companies\r\n  in reserve, fought on a front of 2500 m. from 8 A. M. until noon.\r\n\r\n  The conduct of the advance guard of the 8th Infantry Division\r\n  at =Beaumont= is worthy of imitation. In this case, the support\r\n  battalion was deployed and the artillery went into position; strong\r\n  detachments were retained in rear of the left wing until the main\r\n  body had arrived. Likewise, a proper relation existed between\r\n  frontage (4 battalions on a front of 1400 m.) and distribution in\r\n  depth. According to the General Staff Account of the Franco-German\r\n  war (II, p. 1045), the distribution was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _First line_: 4th Jäger-Battalion, which was subsequently reinforced\r\n  by the IInd Battalion, 96th Infantry and the Ist and IInd Battalions,\r\n  86th Infantry.\r\n\r\n  _Support for the Artillery_: Füsilier Battalion, 96th Infantry.\r\n\r\n  _Reserve_: IIIrd Battalion, 86th Infantry.\r\n\r\n  We have already mentioned the deployment of the advance guard at\r\n  =Spicheren= (p. 226 supra). In that instance the whole force was\r\n  thrown in at once, whereas at =Beaumont= the deployment of the\r\n  different units was coördinated and proceeded systematically. An\r\n  advance guard should be able to repulse an attack and then assume the\r\n  offensive without outside assistance. An example which is not worthy\r\n  of imitation is the engagement of the 29th Infantry Brigade at the\r\n  =Hallue=. The brigade began the fight, without being compelled to do\r\n  so, and deployed its 4530 men on a front of 5000 m. The 30th Infantry\r\n  Brigade (4070 men) then entered the fight and deployed on a front\r\n  of 3000 m. in prolongation of the line of the 29th Brigade. If the\r\n  French had made a decisive attack at this point, the 15th Infantry\r\n  Division would not have been able to repulse it.\r\n\r\nDistribution in depth, for the purpose of warding off an enveloping\r\nmovement and for making a counter-attack, is more necessary in defense\r\nthan in attack; besides, a greater front may be covered in the former\r\ncase on account of the smaller losses. The following factors in part\r\ndetermine the extent of front to be occupied and the number of troops\r\nrequired to defend it: (1) the strength, natural or artificial, of the\r\nposition; (2) obstacles in its front; (3) salient angles which can be\r\neasily enveloped; (4) the intentions of the commander (_i.e._, whether\r\nhe contemplates fighting a purely defensive combat or one including\r\noffensive action).\r\n\r\n=Delaying actions= are usually fought at long and medium ranges as\r\npurely passive defensive combats and no provision is made for replacing\r\ncasualties, the object of the fight being to avoid a decision. Few\r\nmen should, therefore, be placed in the firing line, but these should\r\nbe supplied with abundant ammunition. However, as the force desires\r\nto avoid a decisive engagement by withdrawing, distribution in depth\r\nshould be provided to protect the flanks and to facilitate breaking off\r\nthe action. (Par. 419 German I. D. R.). This requires that distances be\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n=Night attacks=, on account of the element of surprise involved, do not\r\nrequire great distribution in depth; as a rule, the fight is decided\r\nin a very short time by the collision of the opposing forces. However,\r\nmeasures must be taken to protect the flanks, to ensure victory, and to\r\ngive the first line the impetus necessary to carry it forward in case\r\nit is checked.\r\n\r\n  The British attack on the Egyptian position at =Tel el Kebir= (1882)\r\n  was made by only 11,000 men on a front of about 6 km. After a short\r\n  fight the works were taken.\r\n\r\nAn attempt will now be made to give some approximate figures for the\r\nextent of front that may be occupied in various situations.\r\n\r\nAssuming one rifle for every three meters of front occupied, the\r\nfollowing might suffice for temporarily defending a line 1000 m. long:\r\n\r\n  Firing line                                   300 rifles\r\n  Supports (one platoon in rear of each wing)   120   „\r\n  Reserve (two companies)                       400   „\r\n                                                ----------\r\n  Total                                         820 rifles\r\n\r\nThus 0.8 men per meter would be sufficient. This is borne out by the\r\nBoer War. With a good field of fire, even a thin firing line, provided\r\nwith plenty of ammunition, is capable of bringing any attack to a\r\nstandstill, at least for the time being.\r\n\r\n=A defense seeking a decision= requires fighting at short ranges; the\r\nfiring line must be kept constantly at the same strength; losses of\r\nabout one-fifth (killed, wounded, and missing) must be reckoned with;\r\nand, finally, a reserve, consisting of about a third of the effective\r\nstrength of the force, is required for making the counter-attack.\r\nThe firing line is, from the outset, made as dense as possible, and\r\nechelons posted on the flanks must oppose any advance against the\r\nflanks.\r\n\r\nThe following would thus suffice for defending a front of 1000 m.:\r\n\r\n  Firing line                     1000 men\r\n  Replacement of casualties        200  „\r\n  Flank protection (2 companies)   400  „\r\n  Reserve                          800  „\r\n                                  --------\r\n  Total                           2400 men\r\n\r\nHence, 2.4 rifles per meter of front would be available for defense.\r\n\r\nThe defense is decided by a successful counter-attack made by the\r\nreserve, whereas the attack requires an additional force to cover and\r\nassure the assembling and re-forming of the troops. The greater force\r\nis naturally required by the attacker, who must be stronger than the\r\ndefender at the moment when the assault is made. The following would be\r\nrequired for making an attack on a front of 1000 m.:\r\n\r\n  Firing line                      1200 rifles\r\n  Replacement of casualties (¹⁄₂)   600    „\r\n  Flank protection                  400   „\r\n  Reserve                          2000   „\r\n                                   -----------\r\n  Total                            4200 rifles\r\n\r\nThis would be equivalent to 4.2 rifles per meter of front.\r\n\r\nThese figures can only serve as a very general guide, of course, and\r\nshould be considered minima.\r\n\r\n  The number of troops required for attack or defense must be\r\n  determined separately for each individual case. At =Lovtcha=, 25\r\n  battalions, 92 guns, and 15 sotnias were not considered too large\r\n  a force for attacking 8000 Turks with only 6 guns. At =Gorni\r\n  Dubniac=, 3 infantry divisions of the Guard, with 90 guns, attacked\r\n  6 weak Turkish battalions having only 4 guns. After the first two\r\n  unsuccessful assaults on =Plevna=, the Russians overestimated the\r\n  strength of the enemy. Osman Pasha’s force was estimated at 80,000\r\n  men, and, consequently, during the September assaults, 90,000 men and\r\n  400 guns were deemed necessary to attack barely 40,000 Turks and 60\r\n  guns.\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of the foregoing, it appears that the =maximum\r\nfrontage= is justifiable, when a force whose flanks are secure,\r\noccupies a position prepared for defense, or acts as a reserve and is\r\nto bring about a decision which has been prepared by other troops.\r\nOn the other hand, the =maximum distribution in depth= is necessary\r\nfor a force acting alone in attack with both flanks exposed. Between\r\nthese two extremes lie many intermediate degrees, and it is therefore\r\nimpossible to lay down hard and fast rules for the frontage of an\r\nattacking force. The German Infantry Drill Regulations (par. 373)\r\naccordingly fix the frontage of a company in attack at 150 m. and that\r\nof a brigade of six battalions at 1500 m. It is impossible to give a\r\ndefinite ratio of effective strength to combat frontage. Thus, while\r\nin attack a company puts into the line about 1.3 rifles per meter of\r\nits front, the brigade employs 4 rifles per meter, and the larger units\r\na proportionally greater number. The necessity for distribution in\r\ndepth increases with the size of the force and with the number of units\r\ncomposing it.\r\n\r\nIn a company, for example, a platoon is sufficient to fulfill, within\r\ncertain limits, all the functions of a reserve, while in a larger force\r\nthe duties of a reserve are so complex that each task (protecting\r\nthe flanks, reinforcing the firing line, giving the impetus for the\r\nassault, and covering the assembling and re-forming of the attacking\r\nforce) must be assigned to a separate unit. Moreover, the duration of\r\na combat, and, in conjunction therewith, the necessity of reinforcing\r\nthe firing line and covering the flanks, increases with the size of the\r\nforce. During protracted periods of peace, one is too much inclined\r\nto underestimate the wastefulness of a battle and the necessity for\r\nreinforcing the fighting line; one cannot understand why 5 to 6 men\r\nwill not suffice, during the course of a combat, for a front wherein\r\nonly one man can use his rifle. From the foregoing it follows that the\r\nfrontage does not increase in proportion to the number of men. Thus,\r\nan army corps would not occupy a front four times that of a brigade,\r\nor twice that of a division. This is best illustrated by doubling or\r\ntrebling a plane area when both length and breadth have to be equally\r\nincreased.[242]\r\n\r\n    [242] See _Taktik_, V, p. 46, et seq.\r\n\r\nThe maximum frontage to be covered in attack by the firing line of\r\na =company= is fixed at 150 m., in order that the density and fire\r\npower of that line may be constantly maintained during a prolonged and\r\ncostly action. During shorter (_i.e._, rear guard actions), or less\r\ncostly actions (defense), it is, however, permissible to exceed this\r\nlimit. The regulations by no means insist upon a literal interpretation\r\nof this paragraph, since they mention the deployment of the entire\r\ncompany, when it would certainly occupy a front of about 200 m. There\r\nis no disguising the fact, however, that, when extended on a front of\r\n200 m., it is out of the question for the company commander to lead his\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe regulations do not fix the combat frontage of a =battalion=, as it\r\ndepends upon the tactical situation, and the battalion commander is\r\nat liberty to place one, two, three, or four companies into the first\r\nline. The frontage of a battalion would thus be 300 meters when making\r\nan independent attack, and not exceeding 600 meters when fighting a\r\npurely defensive action as part of a larger force, in other words, a\r\nmean frontage of 400 meters.\r\n\r\nThis is also true of the =regiment=. The combat frontage of a regiment\r\nacting alone, will, at the start, seldom exceed that of two battalions\r\ndeployed abreast. From this we obtain a frontage of 600-800 m. for the\r\nregiment when it is acting independently, and a frontage of about 1200\r\nm. when it is fighting a purely defensive action as part of a larger\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nMilitary history tells us that an army corps consisting of 25\r\nbattalions, acting as a part of a larger force in a deliberately\r\nplanned attack, occupies an average front of 2.5 to 5 km. According\r\nto this, the frontage of a brigade would amount to about 800-1000 m.,\r\n_i.e._, to 6-7.5 rifles per meter of front.\r\n\r\n  This limit was frequently exceeded during the =Franco-German war=\r\n  according to the circumstances under which the brigade went into\r\n  action and the commander’s estimate of the situation. If the brigades\r\n  had to cover the concentration of the columns in rear, and if the\r\n  battalions came into action successively, both brigade and battalion\r\n  frontages were frequently very great. The endeavor to close with the\r\n  enemy as soon as possible and the desire to bring a large number of\r\n  rifles into action, led to enormously increased frontages at the\r\n  expense of depth. The brigades which arrived later, entered the line\r\n  where other brigades were already engaged, and the result was a\r\n  dissolution and admixture of all tactical organizations.\r\n\r\n  At =Colombey=, the 25th Brigade covered a front of nearly 3 km. with\r\n  28 companies, only four or five companies remaining in close order.\r\n  Connecting with this brigade on the north, 22 companies, belonging to\r\n  two different divisions of the 1st Army Corps, covered a front of 4\r\n  km., supported by three or four companies in close order. With such\r\n  an overextension of front the offensive or defensive power of a force\r\n  is, of course, crippled.\r\n\r\n  During the battle of =Amiens=, the 3rd Prussian Brigade advanced in\r\n  three columns against the heights north of the Luce. On the left, six\r\n  companies of the 4th Infantry advanced from Domart, in the center,\r\n  four companies from Hangard, and on the right, two companies from\r\n  Demnin. A battery and a troop (_Eskadron_) were attached to each\r\n  column, and the right column was followed by the 44th Infantry.\r\n\r\n  The French advanced troops were pushed back without special\r\n  difficulty, but at the northern edge of the timber, the\r\n  brigade now found itself opposite the French main position\r\n  Cachy--Villers-Bretonneux. The attack on this position began at once,\r\n  and in a short time the 4th Infantry and two batteries were in action\r\n  on the line East corner of the Bois de Hangard--Gentelles (5 km.\r\n  long). At the same time, the 44th Infantry with one battery deployed\r\n  on a front of about 2000 m. to the right of this line. The right wing\r\n  of the 44th Infantry subsequently advanced to attack the trenches\r\n  southeast of Villers-Bretonneux and captured them. The enveloped\r\n  French left wing withdrew to the village named, and rallied on strong\r\n  reserves.\r\n\r\n  This was the situation when the fight came to a standstill toward 1\r\n  o’clock P. M. The brigade fought in a thin line over a mile (four\r\n  English miles) long. The reserve only consisted of three companies\r\n  of the 4th Infantry, at Gentelles, and four companies of the 44th\r\n  Infantry, in rear of the right flank.\r\n\r\n  A defeat was averted only by the timely interference of other\r\n  troops, especially of strong artillery (76 Prussian guns against 24\r\n  French).[243]\r\n\r\n    [243] KUNZ, _Nordarmee_, I, p. 47, et seq.\r\n\r\nThe frontage of a company is definitely fixed, so as to make it easier\r\nfor battalion and regimental commanders to designate combat sections;\r\nthe higher leaders reckon with regimental and brigade fronts. In war,\r\nhowever, the numerical strength varies constantly, and it is therefore\r\nadvisable not to reckon with companies, but with a corresponding number\r\nof rifles (200 on an average). The combat frontages mentioned in drill\r\nregulations only give an approximate idea of the extent of front to\r\nbe covered by organizations which act as part of a larger force in an\r\nattack seeking a decision. The extent of front to be covered in other\r\nsituations, under favorable or unfavorable attack conditions, requires\r\nin each case a separate estimate.\r\n\r\nIn the Boer war, we notice for the first time overextensions of front,\r\nwhich were undoubtedly caused by a desire to avoid the costly frontal\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nAt Magersfontain, on December 11th, 1899, the British division under\r\nLord Methuen (7300 men) covered a front of 12 km.; and during the\r\nattack on Pieters Hill, on February 27th, 1900, the troops under\r\nGeneral Buller (30,000 men) extended over a front of 11 km.\r\n\r\nAt Poplar Grove, 7000 Boers with 7 guns fought on a front of 17 km.\r\n(0.4 men per meter), while the British deployed 25,000 rifles, 5000\r\ntroopers, and 116 guns on a front of 32 km. (0.8 men per meter). In\r\nthe engagement at Diamond Hill, on June 11th, 1900, the army under\r\nLord Roberts (40,000 men) advanced on a front of 37 km. Such liberties\r\ncould be taken only in the face of a shaken enemy who had given up all\r\nthoughts of the offensive. At Paardeberg, February 18th, 1900, the 6th\r\nDivision and the Brigade of Highlanders succeeded in getting close to\r\nthe enemy, but there the attack failed on account of the lack of an\r\nimpetus from the rear. Even in the Russo-Japanese war the frontages\r\nwere greater than those to which we are accustomed. The reason for this\r\noverextension lies in the fact that a numerically inferior assailant\r\nwas desirous of vanquishing the defender, and in order to accomplish\r\nthis purpose, he was obliged to make an extensive use of the spade and\r\nto put all rifles into the first line.\r\n\r\n  ===================+=======+=======+======+==========+==========\r\n                     |       |       |      |Per 10,000|\r\n                     |  Jap. | Russ. |Front-|men.[244] |  Per m.\r\n                     |       |       | age. |Jap.|Russ.|Jap.|Russ.\r\n  -------------------+-------+-------+------+----+-----+----+-----\r\n                     |       |       | km.  |    m.    |   men.\r\n  Liao Yang (West and|       |       |      |    |     |    |\r\n  South front)       |106,700|150,000|  26  |2600| 1750|3.9 | 5.9\r\n                     |       |       |      |    |     |    |\r\n  Shaho              |148,000|257,000|  48  |3330| 1980|3.  | 5.\r\n                     |       |       |      |    |     |    |\r\n  Mukden (exclusive  |       |       |      |    |     |    |\r\n  of Yalu Army)      |247,000|336,000|  96  |3960| 2970|2.6 | 3.4\r\n  -------------------+-------+-------+------+----+-----+----+-----\r\n\r\n    [244] According to data given by Lieut.

Yoda in the _Journal\r\n  of the Officers’ Association_, Tokio.\r\n\r\nThe realization that troops in fortified positions only require small\r\nreinforcements or none at all, very naturally caused frontages to be\r\nincreased and depth of combat formations to be decreased. Gaps in the\r\nattacking line, provided they were kept under observation, proved by no\r\nmeans a disadvantage.[245]\r\n\r\n    [245] At Mukden, on March 3rd, 1905, there was a gap of 7 km.\r\n  between the Japanese IVth and Ist Armies, which was covered by\r\n  only one infantry regiment of Reservists, two dismounted cavalry\r\n  regiments, and one battalion of artillery. However, the Russians were\r\n  fighting on the passive defensive in this case. The insignificant\r\n  danger to be apprehended from such gaps is especially emphasised by\r\n  the French regulations.\r\n\r\nDuring attacks it frequently appeared that the Japanese lacked the\r\nnecessary reinforcements.\r\n\r\n~INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS RIFLES ON THE DENSITY OF BATTLE FORMATIONS.~[246]\r\n\r\n    [246] General MINARELLI-FITZGERALD, _Infanteristische Reflexionen_.\r\n\r\n  ========+======+=======+=============+==================+================\r\n  Rifle.  |Year  |Battle.|Belligerents.|Per km. of the    |Remarks.\r\n          |      |       |             |combat frontage.  |\r\n          |      |       |             +-----+------+-----+\r\n          |of    |       |             |Bat- |Esca- |Field|\r\n          |the   |       |             |tal- |drons |guns.|\r\n          |Cam-  |       |             |ions |@ 150 |     |\r\n          |paign.|       |             |@ 900|troop-|     |\r\n          |      |       |             |ri-  |ers.  |     |\r\n          |      |       |             |fles.|      |     |\r\n  --------+------+-------+-------------+-----+------+-----+----------------\r\n  Muzzle  | 1815 |Water- |French       | 12  | 19   |46   |After Napoleon’s\r\n  loaders.|      |loo    +-------------+-----+------+-----+concentration\r\n          |      |       |British      | 10  | 15   |25   |for battle\r\n          |      |       |             |     |      |     |toward noon.\r\n          +------+-------+-------------+-----+------+-----+----------------\r\n          | 1859 |Sol-   |French and   |  7  |  5   |19   |After the victo-\r\n          |      |ferino |Sardinians   |     |      |     |rious advance of\r\n          |      |       +-------------+-----+------+-----+the Austrian\r\n          |      |       |Austrians    |  7  |  2.5 |21   |VIIIth Corps to\r\n          |      |       |             |     |      |     |S.

Div.\r\n  --------+---+--+-------+------+------+-----+------+-----+-----+----------\r\n\r\nLet us now recapitulate the most important points which have a bearing\r\non combat frontage:\r\n\r\n1. The frontage of individual units cannot be definitely fixed, as it\r\ndepends upon the situation and the purpose of an action.\r\n\r\n2. Favorable terrain, cover, and intrenchments permit an extended front\r\nto be obstinately defended with a weak force.\r\n\r\n3. The frontage does not increase in proportion to the size of the\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n4. An organization (company, battalion, or regiment) fighting as part\r\nof a larger force is justified in deploying on a wider front than when\r\nacting alone.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for distribution in depth increases with the size of the\r\nforce and with the number of units composing it Only the result can\r\ndecide whether a narrow or a wide frontage was justified in a given\r\ncase. A commander will endeavor to hold certain parts of the line with\r\na weak force, posted in groups, while, at the decisive point, he will\r\nthrow in every available man in order to gain the victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisions of Various Regulations.\r\n\r\n  =Austria-Hungary.= Frontage depends upon the tactical situation and\r\n  the terrain. The frontage of a company acting as part of a larger\r\n  force in attack is fixed at about 130-150 paces (97-112 m.). “In\r\n  other situations, a greater frontage is, as a rule, permissible.”\r\n  The battalion acting as part of a larger force in attack, “is, as\r\n  a rule, not to cover a frontage exceeding its own front when in\r\n  line”--in peace exercises, 300-400 paces (225-300 m.). With companies\r\n  of 200 men, 2 rifles, and in the battalion 2.6 rifles are reckoned\r\n  per meter of front. “The increased fighting power of infantry, due\r\n  to better fire effect, in general permits a greater frontage to be\r\n  covered. This will often be taken advantage of, in order to make\r\n  as many troops as possible available for the decisive stage of the\r\n  combat. But this frontage should not be so great, that the requisite\r\n  power of resistance is weakened, or that tactical coöperation or the\r\n  attainment of the object of the combat are impaired.” Further than\r\n  this nothing is prescribed.\r\n\r\n  =France.= Nothing definite is prescribed. The combat is carried on by\r\n  groups separated by intervals.\r\n\r\n  “When _an organisation is acting as part of a larger force_ and has\r\n  to advance directly to the front against a well-defined objective,\r\n  its commander may from the outset push a strong force into action,\r\n  retaining a reserve only in exceptional cases. If one of the flanks\r\n  of this force is in the air, it will be advisable to echelon units in\r\n  rear of the flank which may be threatened. When _an organisation is\r\n  acting alone_, and when both flanks are in the air, a weaker line is\r\n  pushed forward and a reserve is retained....”\r\n\r\n  The enhanced power of firearms permits an extended front to be held,\r\n  especially at the commencement of an action. The only restrictions\r\n  are those dictated by necessity--always to assure effective control\r\n  by the leader and mutual coöperation between the various tactical\r\n  units.\r\n\r\n  This mode of fighting does away with continuous firing lines which no\r\n  longer fulfill the requirements of modern battle.\r\n\r\n  =Belgium.= The frontage of a battalion acting as part of a larger\r\n  force in attack is fixed at 300 m.; in defense this is increased.\r\n\r\n  =Japan.= The provisions of the Japanese regulations are identical\r\n  with those of the German regulations of 1889. The frontage of a\r\n  company is not given. A battalion may cover a frontage not exceeding\r\n  that of three companies. The frontage of a brigade, as a rule, does\r\n  not exceed 1500 m. at the initial deployment.\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= The frontage of a company, unless otherwise specified, is\r\n  governed by the object of the action, the terrain, and the effective\r\n  strength, and, as a rule, does not exceed 250 paces (180 m.). No\r\n  figures are given for the larger units.\r\n\r\n  =England.= While great stress was laid upon narrow fronts and thin\r\n  firing lines prior to the Boer war, opinions swung to the opposite\r\n  extreme after that war. During a decisive attack, a battalion in the\r\n  first line may employ 125 rifles per 100 yards of front (_i.e._, 90\r\n  m.), distributed as firing line, supports, and battalion reserve;\r\n  the latter may consist either of one company or of parts of several.\r\n  Entire companies are deployed only in exceptional cases, for\r\n  instance in terrain devoid of cover where it is difficult to bring\r\n  up reinforcements. The size of the reserve depends upon the losses\r\n  likely to be suffered by the fighting line. When these losses will\r\n  be small in all probability, the reserve may be as strong as the\r\n  firing line and the supports combined. In accordance with these\r\n  general principles, a battalion may deploy for attack on a front\r\n  not exceeding 800 yds. = 720 m. (Formerly 540 m. was prescribed).\r\n  A brigade consisting of four battalions will thus be able to cover\r\n  either a front of 1400 or one of 2100 m., depending upon the number\r\n  of battalions put into the line.\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= Only general principles are prescribed. “Skill in judging\r\n  the proper frontage to be covered by a force is attained in time of\r\n  peace by exercises on varied ground and under different situations,\r\n  especially when organizations approximately at war strength are used.”\r\n\r\n\r\n5. COMBAT ORDERS.[247]\r\n\r\n    [247] V. KIESLING, _Gefechtsbefehle_, Berlin, 1907.\r\n\r\nModern fire effect does not permit a commander to direct the course\r\nof an action by despatching adjutants from time to time. This must\r\nbe borne in mind when issuing a combat order. Such an order can only\r\nregulate the launching of the troops into action and prescribe a task\r\nas a guide for their subsequent conduct. Since leaders change during\r\nthe course of the combat, the order must ensure coöperation of the\r\ncomponent parts of the force by thoroughly explaining the purpose of\r\nthe fight. The troops have a right to know what the commander expects\r\nof them; it is not sufficient to order them to occupy a certain\r\npoint--they must be told whether or not they are to defend it. An order\r\nwhich directs troops “to oppose” the enemy, conveys an extremely vague\r\nmeaning; it should specify instead whether they are “to attack” the\r\nenemy, or whether they are “to defend” a position. The subordinate\r\nleader’s pertinent question, as to the purpose of the combat, forces\r\nthe commander to indicate clearly whether he intends to attack, or\r\nto stand on the defensive; whether he will fight a delaying action,\r\nor avoid a decision by withdrawing. Even the lowest grades must be\r\ninformed of this decision of the commander. The troops will perform\r\nanything that is demanded of them in definite terms. On the other hand,\r\nthe commander must demand that no subordinate “hide” behind an order\r\nand that, on the contrary, he act on his own initiative when an order\r\nis not received or the situation changes.\r\n\r\nClearly defined sections of the battlefield (par. 475 German I. D. R.)\r\nand definite combat tasks, each complete in itself (par. 293 German\r\nI. D. R.), are assigned to the tactical units to be employed in the\r\nfirst line (battalions in case of a regiment; regiments, as a rule,\r\nin case of a division). In attack, the order indicates the front upon\r\nwhich each one of the larger units is to deploy and what portion of the\r\nhostile position it is to attack. This demarcation defines the extent\r\nof the combat sections (par. 371 German I. D. R.), within the limits of\r\nwhich the particular unit must make the most of the accidents of the\r\nground. In carrying out these combat tasks, unity of action is ensured\r\nby the mutual coöperation of the tactical units fighting abreast of\r\neach other (par. 475 German I. D. R.), and by the designation of a\r\nunit upon which the others regulate their movements, without, however,\r\nthereby being hampered in their endeavor to advance. (Base unit of\r\ncombat). Moreover, by employing his reserves, the commander “can shift\r\nthe decisive point of the action to any place desired, reinforce where\r\nhe deems it advisable, equalize fluctuations of the combat, and,\r\nfinally, bring about the decision.”\r\n\r\nThe first orders--those for putting the troops in motion in the desired\r\ndirection--are usually verbal; more detailed orders, which are the rule\r\nfrom the brigade on up, are issued subsequently. (Par. 274 German I.\r\nD. R.). In most cases, the commander knows quite well what he wants,\r\nbut only the effort required in expressing in writing what he desires\r\nto say, enables him to reproduce his thoughts with the necessary\r\nclearness. Even in peace maneuvers, the officer who issued an order\r\nand its recipients quite frequently disagree as to its interpretation;\r\nthe superior remembers only what he desired to say at the particular\r\nmoment, but not the language in which the order was couched. Written\r\norders minimize the possibility of a misunderstanding. They have the\r\nfurther advantage that the recipient has in his possession a document\r\nto which he can always refer in case of doubt.\r\n\r\nOrders should not provide for maintaining communication, for protecting\r\nflanks, and for keeping up local reconnaissance, since these matters\r\nare attended to as a matter of course, every leader being held\r\nresponsible for making proper dispositions, within the limits of his\r\ncommand, for the performance of these duties. The higher the rank\r\nof the commander, the farther he should stay away from the scene of\r\nbattle. As the commander can exercise an influence on the course of\r\nthe action only by employing his reserves, he should remain near them,\r\nor, at any rate, retain their leader on his staff. If the commander\r\nselects a position too close to the point where the first line is\r\nengaged, he loses sight of the action in its entirety, and allows\r\nhimself to be influenced too much by events within his immediate range\r\nof vision.[248] The subordinate commander, in selecting his position,\r\nhas to consider only good observation of the enemy, communication\r\nwith neighboring units, with the next higher commander, and with his\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\n    [248] This was true of Sir Redvers Buller at Colenso, and likewise\r\n  of Kuropatkin. The latter led in person too much and was completely\r\n  lost in the details of minor troop-leading.\r\n\r\nAt headquarters, the work to be performed must be carefully apportioned\r\namong the different members of the staff.\r\n\r\nThe commander, assisted by an officer of his staff, observes the enemy\r\nand his own force, while another officer maintains communication with\r\nthe neighboring force and with the next higher headquarters (signal\r\nflag squads, telephone), and receives and prepares reports. (The scheme\r\ndescribed would be appropriate for a brigade staff, for example). It is\r\nfurthermore desirable to despatch information officers to neighboring\r\ntroops, and to detail officers from subordinate units to receive orders.\r\n\r\nThe detailing of adjutants from subordinate units for the purpose of\r\nfacilitating the issue and despatch of orders of higher headquarters is\r\nvery properly prohibited by par. 83 German F. S. R.; on the march, this\r\nis permissible temporarily only. The battalion supply officers will,\r\nhowever, frequently be utilized as information officers, for, on the\r\nday of battle, they would thus be most profitably employed.\r\n\r\n  In =France= this is regulated by _Agents de liaison_. These are to\r\n  keep the commander informed in regard to the special situation, the\r\n  action of subordinate units, and the intentions of their commanders.\r\n  “The importance of permanent communication between leader and\r\n  subordinate increases with the distances separating troops in action;\r\n  the leader’s influence on the course of the combat can be ensured\r\n  only by these _agents_.\r\n\r\n  As a general rule, one mounted officer from every infantry unit,\r\n  from the battalion up, reports to the next higher commander for the\r\n  purpose of maintaining communication. This officer may detail a\r\n  cyclist or trooper to accompany him. He is to be prepared to give all\r\n  necessary information in regard to his unit, and to keep in touch\r\n  with the general situation in order to inform his immediate superior\r\n  in regard to it. He communicates with his own unit either by sending\r\n  orderlies with messages, or by carrying the orders of the commander\r\n  in person.”\r\n\r\n\r\n6. COMMUNICATION ON THE BATTLEFIELD.\r\n\r\nCyclists and mounted messengers can be employed on the battlefield\r\nonly when the conditions are exceptionally favorable; even intrenched\r\nconnecting posts communicating with one another by means of shouts\r\nor signals do not absolutely ensure communication in a protracted\r\nengagement. Heliographs or signal lamps are valuable only during the\r\napproach to the battlefield and in large battles.[249] The same is\r\ntrue of the field telegraph, by means of which, for example, division\r\nheadquarters may be connected with the headquarters of the corps. In\r\nan infantry combat, only the field telephone, wig-wag flags,[250] and\r\nsignal flags can be used. The employment of telephone and telegraph\r\nhas the advantage of ensuring greater quiet at headquarters, since the\r\ncoming and going of messengers is eliminated; on the other hand, the\r\ncommander is at once informed of every reverse (which may perhaps be\r\nonly temporary) and will not always be able to resist the temptation of\r\nleading subordinate commanders by apron strings. The Japanese made a\r\nvery extensive use of the various means of communication, but neglected\r\nto guard against an interruption of their lines of information by\r\ninstalling signal flag stations. This cannot be dispensed with. In the\r\nJapanese army visual signals[251] were not used, and in the Russian\r\narmy they were not adopted until October 4th, 1904. Thus means of\r\ncommunication did not develop beyond the rudimentary stage in both\r\narmies. According to all previous experience, telephone lines, as\r\nnow operated, are practicable in attack only for the purpose of\r\nestablishing communication down to brigade headquarters.[252]\r\n\r\n    [249] See _Taktik_, III, p. 116, et seq.\r\n\r\n    VON LÖBELL’S _Jahresberichte_ 1906, p. 390: _Employment of\r\n  Heliographs and Signal Lamps in Southwest Africa_.\r\n\r\n    [250] Wig-wag signals have been abolished and Morse signals\r\n  prescribed in their stead by Cabinet Orders dated January 16th, 1908.\r\n\r\n    [251] Sir IAN HAMILTON, _A Staff Officer’s Scrap Book_, I, pp.\r\n  173-174, 196, 241 and 323.\r\n\r\n    [252] The station apparatus furnished by the firm of “Zwietusch” of\r\n  Charlottenburg, weighs 5.5 kg. with its battery.\r\n\r\n    In defensive positions, which are held for a prolonged period,\r\n  it is, of course, practicable to establish telephonic connection\r\n  with the most advanced line. This was, for example, the case in the\r\n  Japanese 10th Division on the morning of March 3rd, 1905 (Mukden).\r\n  On this occasion the division commander in rear was informed by\r\n  telephone of the presence of wire entanglements in front of the\r\n  Russian position, and permission was asked and granted to postpone\r\n  the attack.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, both signal and wig-wag flags were used in\r\nGermany.[253] The signal motions are made in an upright position,\r\nthe Morse code, which is rather difficult to learn, being used. This\r\nmethod of signaling permits communication to be kept up within a radius\r\nof 7 km.; moreover, it can be used at night and in combined land and\r\nnaval operations. The wig-wag signals are easily learned and entirely\r\nsufficient for communicating over distances within 3 km.; they also\r\npermit information to be despatched rapidly, as abbreviations are\r\nemployed for certain frequently recurring movements. These signals\r\npossess the additional advantage that they can be made by a man while\r\nin a prone position.[254] Wig-wag signals are a very effective means of\r\ncommunication and will rarely fail.[255]\r\n\r\n    [253] _Jahrbücher für Armee und Marine_, June number, 1906, and\r\n  March number, 1907.\r\n\r\n    [254] Signals with wig-wag flags can be made by a man lying flat\r\n  on his belly or on his back; this is, however, frequently impossible\r\n  with outstretched arms and the sender must be content to make the\r\n  signals by grasping the staves of the two flags in the middle, then\r\n  placing them in appropriate position relative to each other (for\r\n  example in making the letters, d, e, k, l, p, u).\r\n\r\n    [255] The signals prescribed in par. 11 German I. D. R. are very\r\n  effective if made with wig-wag flags; if made with signal flags they\r\n  require constant observation, without, however, precluding mistakes.\r\n  For example, when given with signal flags, the signal “halt” - “h,\r\n  h, h,” (.... .... ....) is frequently confused with the signal “the\r\n  assault is about to begin” (... ... ...). This mistake is not so apt\r\n  to occur when wig-wag flags are used.\r\n\r\n    When General Stakelberg, after his right flank had been turned at\r\n  Wafangu, sent orders to withdraw to General Gerngross, the commander\r\n  on the left flank, it took the officer who carried the order through\r\n  this mountainous country, nearly an hour to cover the 5 km. which\r\n  separated the two commanders. An order sent by means of wig-wag flags\r\n  could have reached the leader in question within a few minutes.\r\n\r\nA commander should not exercise a constant influence on his\r\nsubordinates just because modern means of communication permit him\r\nto do so, as this would destroy all initiative and independence. The\r\npermanent communication to which we are accustomed in time of peace,\r\nand the method of leading produced thereby, do not allow real qualities\r\nof leadership and initiative to develop. It is unquestionably not easy\r\nfor a commander to refrain from interfering when a deployment does\r\nnot progress with sufficient rapidity or not in accordance with his\r\nwishes.[256]\r\n\r\n    [256] Interference of the Commander-In-Chief of the IIIrd Army\r\n  with the deployment of the 1st Bavarian Army Corps at Wörth. KUNZ,\r\n  _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 15, p. 44, et seq. The impatience\r\n  of the commander-in-chief was natural perhaps, but, due to his\r\n  interference, the enveloping movement skillfully initiated by General\r\n  v. d. Tann, could not be executed.\r\n\r\n  =Austria-Hungary.= “Infantry telegraph detachments” are assigned\r\n  to every infantry division and brigade of mountain troops.[257]\r\n  These detachments are charged with the duty of keeping up the\r\n  visual signal and telegraph service in field and mountain warfare.\r\n  The Morse alphabet is used in visual signaling and in telegraphic\r\n  communication. In this the Austrian regulations differ from the\r\n  German. The infantry telegraph detachment attached to an infantry\r\n  division is divided into three sections, and is equipped with\r\n  telephones, wire, heliographs, and signal flags. Each section\r\n  consists of 15 men (6 of whom are telegraphers), and is equipped with\r\n  24 km. of wire.\r\n\r\n    [257] _Streffleur_, 1905, April-May number.\r\n\r\n  =France.= Provisional signal detachments have been formed in some of\r\n  the infantry organizations. These detachments are to take care of\r\n  visual signal and telephone communication. The telephone sections are\r\n  expected to maintain two stations (12 km. wire).\r\n\r\n  =England.= Each brigade (4 battalions) has one telephone detachment.\r\n  Wire (9.6 km.) is carried along on two pack animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. LOCAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE INFANTRY.\r\n\r\n(Pars. 305, 319, 355, 363 and 376 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact that, while splendid work was done in strategic\r\nreconnaissance in the large maneuvers of recent years, not only in\r\nGermany but also in France, the local, tactical reconnaissance was less\r\ngood and often deficient, so that in consequence thereof surprises\r\nwere not rare. Frequently a gap occurred in the reconnoitering line\r\nwhen the cavalry in front of the various parts of the army was brushed\r\naside and the stronger cavalry force deprived the weaker of the freedom\r\nof choosing its line of retreat. Occasionally, when this happened,\r\ncavalry patrols were sent out with orders to report directly to the\r\ninfantry, or, at any rate, to find the hostile route columns, but\r\nthis expedient was only partially successful. It must be remembered\r\nthat troopers cannot ride close enough to the enemy to see anything\r\nof importance, and that they frequently are in ignorance of the very\r\nthings which are of value for the infantry. In addition, the divisional\r\ncavalry is entirely too weak to perform all the tasks assigned to\r\nit. Therefore infantry and artillery should not rely upon cavalry\r\nreconnaissance. The mere fact that infantry has sent out cavalry\r\npatrols in a certain direction does not relieve it from the duty of\r\nproviding for its own reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nThe greatest obstacle to infantry reconnaissance lies in the fact\r\nthat its cyclists are confined to good roads; that its mounted\r\nofficers cannot be withdrawn from their appropriate duties except\r\nfor short periods; that, as a rule, orderlies are not available for\r\ncarrying messages; and that, if officers carry messages in person, the\r\nreconnaissance is interrupted. Infantry patrols, on account of the\r\nslowness of their movements, cannot transmit messages quickly, and,\r\nas a result, such messages frequently arrive too late to be of any\r\nvalue. On the other hand, infantry patrols possess an advantage in\r\nthat, by utilizing cover, they can get close to the enemy without being\r\nobserved. The need of local reconnaissance is greater now than it was\r\nin the past, because troops can no longer change front when deployed,\r\nand because those which come under hostile fire while in close order\r\nformations may, in a short time, suffer well-nigh annihilating losses.\r\n\r\n  In the South African war the British infantry was frequently placed\r\n  in difficult situations by the suddenly delivered fire of the Boers\r\n  (=Magersfontain=, =Colenso=), which induced it to deploy all of its\r\n  lines on a wide front at an early moment.\r\n\r\n  The Japanese attached much importance to local reconnaissance,\r\n  whereas the Russian leaders considered it as something unusual, so\r\n  that Kuropatkin was finally obliged to prescribe it in army orders.\r\n  “Local reconnaissance was performed by 20 to 30 infantrymen. These\r\n  carefully approached our positions in small groups. One man of each\r\n  group laid his rifle aside and crawled close up to our trenches,\r\n  raised his head and observed, while three or four of his companions,\r\n  whom he had left farther in rear, opened fire on the trenches.\r\n  Occasionally all of these men threw themselves flat on the ground for\r\n  protection. This mode of procedure continued for seven hours.”\r\n\r\n  The thoroughness of the reconnaissance generally made a timely\r\n  deployment possible, even when the enemy was well concealed, but that\r\n  neglects occurred nevertheless is borne out by the advance of the\r\n  Japanese 2nd Division at =Fuchau= and =Kapukai= on March 10th, 1905.\r\n  This division advanced without reconnoitering, struck the fortified\r\n  Russian position, was unable to move forward or to the rear, and had\r\n  to fight under unfavorable conditions, and while suffering heavy\r\n  losses, from early morning until 4 P. M., when the general situation\r\n  compelled the enemy to evacuate the position. The advance of the\r\n  Russian 54th Division (Orlof) during the battle of =Liao Yang= (2nd\r\n  Sept.) is a similar example of disproportionately greater importance\r\n  and with a tragic ending. The noise of the battle at =Sykwantun=\r\n  caused the commander of the 54th Division to leave the position\r\n  assigned him on the heights of the =Yentai= mines and to march toward\r\n  the sound of the cannonading. The division, advancing over covered\r\n  terrain without adequate reconnaissance, was taken in flank and rear\r\n  by the Japanese 12th Brigade (Sasaki),[258] and thrown back in utter\r\n  rout upon its former position, carrying with it the troops which had\r\n  been left there. Thus the Yentai heights fell into the possession of\r\n  the Japanese.\r\n\r\n    [258] For details of the attack made by Sasaki’s Brigade, see\r\n  GERTSCH, _Vom russisch-japanischen Kriege_, I, sketch 14.\r\n\r\nThe primary object of local reconnaissance is to protect a force from\r\nsurprise. This may be accomplished by sending out combat patrols, and\r\nby company commanders riding ahead in time. (Par. 457 German I. D. R.).\r\nThe latter are likewise charged with picking out avenues of approach to\r\nselected fire positions, and the sooner they begin the reconnaissance\r\nthe better, for the accidents of the ground can then be utilized to the\r\nbest advantage.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the reconnaissance are increased when we have to\r\nreckon with the measures taken by the enemy to screen his force.[259]\r\n\r\n    [259] The attacker’s reconnaissance must be prevented as long as\r\n  possible. Frequently patrols in the foreground will suffice for this\r\n  purpose. (Par. 406 German I. D. R.)\r\n\r\nWeak infantry patrols can neither break down this resistance nor create\r\nthe necessary opening through which the leaders can reconnoiter in\r\nperson. Stronger forces are requisite, and “reconnaissance companies”\r\nmay have to be sent out toward the enemy to serve as a support for the\r\npatrols, to reinforce them when necessary, and to constitute natural\r\ncollecting stations for messages. “Reconnaissances in force” are the\r\nresult of these endeavors to obtain information,[260] for the defender\r\nwill not reveal his dispositions unless the attacker threatens an\r\nattack. Reconnaissances in force are especially appropriate in this\r\ncase, since the information obtained in regard to the position and\r\nstrength of the enemy can be utilized at once. (Par. 134 German F. S.\r\nR.).\r\n\r\n    [260] See _Taktik_, IV. p. 214, et seq. The results of the\r\n  reconnaissance in force made at Neuville aux Bois were very\r\n  unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn France great importance is attached to forcibly gaining information\r\nby means of detachments of all arms which also prevent hostile\r\nreconnaissance. In minor operations the French send out infantry\r\ndetachments, which, from secure hiding places, pick off observers,\r\nscreen the position of their own force, and prevent the enemy from\r\nusing covered avenues of approach. However, these very patrol combats\r\nmay cause the commander to come to a false conclusion in regard to\r\nthe hostile position. If the cavalry reconnaissance has determined\r\nthat the enemy intends to accept battle within a particular area, the\r\ndetails of his intentions must be obtained by local reconnaissance.\r\nThen the commander will wish to know whether or not an immediate attack\r\nis feasible, or whether it is advisable to wait until nightfall for\r\nbringing up the infantry. The local reconnaissance determines where\r\nthe flanks of the enemy are located; whether the position in front is\r\nthe hostile main position or only an advanced post; whether the enemy\r\nhas made preparations for defense; and where the hostile artillery is\r\nposted. As a rule, it will be impossible, until after the engagement\r\nhas begun, to recognize a skillfully located fortified position,[261]\r\nto distinguish between the real and dummy trenches, determine the\r\nposition of obstacles and estimate whether they can be surmounted with\r\nor without adequate apparatus. Then it likewise becomes necessary\r\nto find and mark covered avenues of approach.[262] In moving to new\r\nfiring positions, it is important that advanced positions, masks, and\r\ndummy trenches be recognized in time. The commander of a unit on a\r\nflank should make dispositions for observation on his flank, and for\r\npermanent communication with neighboring units, even though no specific\r\norders have been received by him to that effect. Strange as it may\r\nseem, the troops deployed on the road Gorze--Rezonville (battle of\r\nVionville), by their failure to get into early communication with the\r\ntroops which had been on the ground for some time, neglected to take\r\nadvantage of the information gained by those troops.[263]\r\n\r\n    [261] See _Taktik_, V, p. 243, et seq.\r\n\r\n    [262] HOPPENSTEDT (_Schlacht der Zukunft_, pp. 134 and 140) draws a\r\n  graphic picture which is a faithful reproduction of reality.\r\n\r\n    The procedure outlined by that author (_Ibid._, p. 122) for\r\n  indicating, by means of flag signals, points sheltered from hostile\r\n  fire, seems practicable. He states: “Holding his flag upright, the\r\n  member of the patrol proceeds steadily on his way to Weyer. Now he\r\n  has arrived at the point where the road bends slightly toward the\r\n  south; his flag descends,” etc.\r\n\r\n    [263] KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 8-9, p. 128, et seq.,\r\n  p. 243.\r\n\r\n    The necessity for thorough reconnaissance is illustrated by the\r\n  successful “fire surprises” carried out by the Boers at Modder River\r\n  on November 28th, 1899, and at Colenso, against Hart’s Brigade\r\n  advancing in dense masses, on December 15th, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of these tasks shows that local reconnaissance should\r\nnot be restricted to the preparatory stage of the combat alone, but\r\nthat it must be kept up during the whole course of the action. To\r\nthe duties enumerated, we may add, occasional tasks, such as picking\r\noff staffs and signal men; sneaking up on artillery that has been\r\nincautiously pushed forward; and annoying the enemy by flanking fire.\r\nFor such tasks, so-called “scouting detachments,”[264] after the\r\nRussian pattern, have frequently been recommended. Their usefulness\r\nin difficult country and in operations against the enemy’s flank\r\nand rear cannot be denied. In minor operations, if provided with\r\nample ammunition and advancing on side roads, they can hamper the\r\nreconnaissance of the enemy, secure the flanks of their own force,\r\nascertain the probable extent of the prospective battlefield, and\r\nfinally, having made a skillful lodgment, they can become very annoying\r\nto the hostile artillery. In a large battle the necessary elbow room\r\nfor such employment is lacking. To form picked men into special\r\norganizations, as is done in Russia, is always of doubtful value. The\r\nconstant transfer of their best men to the mounted infantry during\r\nthe second part of the South African war was fatal to the British\r\ninfantry battalions. An organization cannot dispense with its good\r\nmen; it needs them to replace wounded non-commissioned officers. While\r\neverything goes without a hitch, the withdrawal of good men from an\r\norganization is of little importance; the drawbacks to this procedure\r\nbecome apparent, however, when the line begins to waver, when, in the\r\nabsence of officers, only the example of the courageous men prevents\r\nthe weak-kneed from running away. Our regulations properly appreciate\r\nthe importance of psychological impressions during critical combat\r\nsituations; they state: “The man who feels his courage and coolness\r\ngoing, in the excitement of battle, should look toward his officers.\r\nShould they have fallen, he will find plenty of non-commissioned\r\nofficers and brave privates, whose example will revive his courage.”\r\n(Par. 268 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [264] V. TETTAU, _Die Jagdkommandos der russischen Armee_, Berlin,\r\n  1901.\r\n\r\n    HOPPENSTEDT, _Patrouillen- und Radfahr-Kommandos_, 1907.\r\n\r\nIf it becomes necessary to despatch a stronger infantry force on a\r\nmission of minor importance, it will usually be better to detail an\r\nentire company than to improvise a detachment whose leader would know\r\nhis men only imperfectly.\r\n\r\n  Before the 95th Infantry (French) made its attack on the brewery\r\n  of =l’Amitié= (south of =Noisseville=), on August 31st, 1870, a\r\n  reconnoitering detachment had ascertained the strength of the\r\n  position and the manner in which it was held by the defender.[265]\r\n\r\n    [265] _Wald- und Ortsgefecht_, p. 192.\r\n\r\n  =Examples of the successful employment of flanking fire by small\r\n  forces:=\r\n\r\n  The flanking fire, delivered from the =Bois des Ognons= by about\r\n  30 men of the 12th Company, 72nd Infantry, compelled the French to\r\n  withdraw their left flank. (Combat on the Gorze--Rezonville road,\r\n  16th August, 1870).[266]\r\n\r\n    [266] KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 8-9, p. 146.\r\n\r\n  At =Gravelotte-St. Privat=, flanking fire is said to have caused the\r\n  withdrawal of nine French battalions which had until then delivered\r\n  an effective fire upon the Prussian Guard Artillery.[267]\r\n\r\n    [267] _Ibid._, 10, p. 24, and 12, p. 24, et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TERRAIN.\r\n\r\nThe defense requires extensive, open terrain, permitting unobstructed\r\nview, while the attack requires stretches of ground hidden from the\r\nobservation of the enemy and sheltered from his fire, in order that\r\nthe troops may be deployed for action at the decisive ranges. A piece\r\nof ground will rarely possess all these advantages, but, nevertheless,\r\nwell-trained infantry will be able to defend successfully a piece\r\nof ground that has a poor field of fire, and infantry which is\r\nenergetically and skillfully led will be able to cross even an open\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nAt the longer ranges, a force will, in the first place, endeavor to\r\nkeep concealed. While advancing, troops will rarely be able to take\r\nadvantage of available cover, but at a halt and while firing they\r\nwill be able to do so. Their taking advantage of the ground should\r\nnot lead to a diminution of the energy of the advance, and should\r\nnot cause parts of the force to fall behind.[268] “The terrain\r\nexerts considerable influence on the formation of troops. Open\r\ncountry requires that distances be increased so that the losses may\r\nbe minimized, while close country permits distances to be reduced.\r\nThe commander should take particular care not to let this advantage\r\nescape him, since it is often necessary in this case to reinforce the\r\nfirst line promptly. Close order formations may be retained longest on\r\ncovered terrain.” (Par. 307 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [268] This is equally true of ground that is difficult to march\r\n  over; the troops must cross it. The evasion of difficult portions of\r\n  terrain usually leads to disorder and a dispersion of the troops.\r\n  For the advance of the 18th Infantry Brigade at Wörth, see KUNZ,\r\n  _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 14, p. 101. (Thick underbrush in\r\n  the woods on the Fuchshübel.)\r\n\r\nAn attack over a plain devoid of cover “should be avoided as far as\r\npossible, or weak, widely extended detachments only should be ordered\r\nto advance over it, while the bulk of the force is launched at a point\r\nwhere an approach under cover is practicable. If suitable terrain is\r\nlacking to permit this, then the decisive attack must be led over\r\nthe open plain.” (Par. 325 German I. D. R.). In contrast with the\r\ncontinuous skirmish lines of the past, which are still favored by the\r\nAustrians, the German regulations permit a gap to be left in the line\r\nwhere an open plain devoid of cover exists, without thereby implying\r\nthat it cannot be crossed. The French regulations (par. 257), contrary\r\nto the German, contemplate that “only weak detachments be left in the\r\nopen, fire swept spaces,” and that the troops intended for the fire\r\nfight be pushed forward under available cover, separate groups being\r\nthus formed.[269]\r\n\r\n    [269] This should be an important hint for the opponent. The lines\r\n  of approach may perhaps be sheltered with reference to a certain\r\n  point, but there will always be portions of the enemy’s line from\r\n  which a fire may be directed upon these avenues of approach and the\r\n  troops marching thereon.\r\n\r\n“This mode of fighting in groups does away with the continuous firing\r\nlines of the past which no longer fulfill the requirements of modern\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n“The rearmost fractions of the force endeavor to avoid open spaces,\r\nor such as are swept by hostile fire, by moving, sometimes in a close\r\norder formation and again widely extended, toward the lines of cover,\r\nwithout regard to the direction in which the enemy may happen to be.\r\nThe unit that finds the advance easiest takes the lead, and all the\r\nothers, supported by the fire of their immediate neighbors, endeavor to\r\nfollow it.\r\n\r\n“Depending upon the character of the terrain and available cover, the\r\nforces deployed for the fire fight will, therefore, advance in a\r\nrather dense formation in the areas favorable for such a procedure,\r\nwhile weak forces only will be found on open and fire swept ground. The\r\nadvance is regulated by designating the objective of the attack and by\r\nstipulating the necessity of mutual coöperation.”\r\n\r\nThis French group attack owes its existence to the silently accepted\r\nfact that an open plain cannot be crossed when swept by unsubdued\r\nhostile fire; it reckons with an unfavorable terrain such as an\r\nattacker will only find in exceptional cases. We by no means fail to\r\nrecognize the fact that individual portions of the attacker’s force,\r\nwhen favored by the terrain, will be able to advance more quickly than\r\nothers, and that other portions may even be compelled to discontinue\r\ntheir advance for a time; but it seems a precarious proceeding to lay\r\ndown this result of the hostile fire effect as a guide in the training\r\nof troops. The group tactics of the Boers stood the test only on the\r\ndefensive; they could not prevent individual groups from being attacked\r\nby far superior forces. In an attack, the units favored by the terrain\r\nwill constitute the framework upon which the units which are compelled\r\nto advance more slowly, will form. There is, however, danger that these\r\nleading groups will succumb to the superior fire of a defender who is\r\ndeployed on a broader front. Although this may not happen, the spirit\r\nof the regulations tempts leaders to drive everything forward, to rush\r\nahead with isolated parts of the force. An additional drawback of these\r\nsystematic group tactics lies in the difficulty of deploying the troops\r\nmoving in the narrow avenue of approach. If the French infantry really\r\ndesires to avoid the plain and wants to stick principally to cover,\r\nwho will guarantee that the great freedom allowed it, will not cause\r\nit to crowd together under cover, lose the direction to its objective,\r\nand become completely mixed up?[270] This danger is the more imminent\r\nsince no importance is attached to a more definite limitation of the\r\nfrontage to be covered, while wide extension is, on the contrary,\r\nactually preached. The fear of losses will gain the upper hand and\r\nthe attack will lose its energy. “It is easy to teach troops to be\r\nover-cautious, but it is a precarious undertaking to lead such troops\r\nagainst the enemy.” (Sir IAN HAMILTON).\r\n\r\n    [270] The plentiful cover along the ravine of the Mance brook was\r\n  by no means an actual advantage for the Ist Army. The 18th of August\r\n  presents the strange phenomenon of the success of the attack on St.\r\n  Privat, made over terrain devoid of cover, and the failure of the\r\n  attack on the French IInd Corps, made over the most favorable terrain\r\n  imaginable.\r\n\r\n  Whither such an endeavor to utilize cover must lead, is shown by the\r\n  advance of the 35th Füsilier Regiment past =Vionville= on =Flavigny=\r\n  and the group of trees north of that village. The violent fire\r\n  directed upon these companies caused them to deviate to right and\r\n  left, to leave their battalions, and to lose the march direction\r\n  designated by the regimental commander.[271] One company of the IInd\r\n  Battalion 35th Füsilier Regiment, which formed the center (march\r\n  direction, a point north of Flavigny), participated in the assault\r\n  made on Flavigny by the IIIrd Battalion; the other companies moved to\r\n  the left against Vionville and were joined by a company of the IIIrd\r\n  Battalion.--“A peculiar feature of this fight was the fire directed\r\n  from the group of trees on the attacking force which advanced against\r\n  the center of the hostile position. Ten of the twelve companies of\r\n  the attacking force (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 11th of the\r\n  35th Füsilier Regiment, and 9th, 10th and 12th of the 20th Infantry)\r\n  were scattered to right and left by this fire, and forced to move\r\n  in a totally different direction than was originally intended. The\r\n  direction was maintained to a certain extent only by two companies\r\n  (the 3rd and 11th of the 20th Infantry).”[272]\r\n\r\n    [271] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 560.\r\n\r\n    [272] V. SCHERFF, _Kriegslehren_, II, p. 106. With a sketch (A)\r\n  showing lines of advance of the companies.\r\n\r\nWhile the new German Infantry Drill Regulations do not underestimate\r\nthe difficulties of an advance over open ground, they require that the\r\nmarch direction be maintained and that cover be utilized only within\r\nthe assigned “combat section”; they leave it to subordinate commanders\r\nto choose suitable expedients for crossing such unfavorable ground.\r\n“Within the limits of the section assigned to an organization for an\r\nattack, the plain devoid of cover should be avoided as far as possible,\r\nor weak, widely extended detachments only should be ordered to advance\r\nover it, while the bulk of the force is launched at a point where an\r\napproach under cover is practicable. _If suitable terrain is lacking\r\nto permit this, then the decisive attack must be led over the open\r\nplain._” (Par. 325 German I. D. R.). For purposes of instruction, it\r\nis entirely correct to require “that even on terrain devoid of cover,\r\nwell-trained infantry should not open fire until the medium ranges are\r\nreached.” (Par. 326 German I. D. R.). The necessity, when under hostile\r\nfire, of adapting movements to the accidents of the ground, should not\r\nimpair the energy of the advance and cause portions of the attacking\r\nforce to lag behind, thereby disintegrating it. On the other hand, we\r\nshould not be afraid to leave gaps in our attacking line, as the enemy\r\nwould, in any case, not be able to use them for his own advance.\r\n\r\nThus we have here the German united attack, on the one hand, and\r\nthe French group attack, on the other. Since group tactics no\r\ndoubt diminish losses, they should be used in delaying actions, in\r\nholding attacks, and in defense; they should unquestionably not be\r\nemployed when a concerted, rapid movement of skirmishers to the front\r\nbecomes necessary. How should the Vth Corps at Wörth and the Guard\r\nat St. Privat, for instance, have attacked, according to the French\r\nregulations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MACHINE GUNS.[273]\r\n\r\n    [273] _Exerzierreglement und Schieszvorschrift für die\r\n  Maschinengewehrabteilungen_, 1904.\r\n\r\n    Captain BRAUN, _Das Maxim-Maschinengewehr und seine Verwendung_,\r\n  Berlin, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARM.\r\n\r\nThe effect of canister had decreased considerably with the introduction\r\nof rifled guns, and this was the more noticeable, because,\r\nsimultaneously therewith, the accuracy and rate of fire of the infantry\r\nrifle was greatly increased. The attempts to re-invest the artillery\r\nwith its one-time superiority were directed in two channels: one aimed\r\nat perfecting shrapnel, which had been rather neglected up to this\r\ntime (England, Prussia, Austria), while the other resurrected the\r\nmediaeval idea of the “barrel-organ gun,” with a view of assembling a\r\nnumber of rifle barrels and of combining thereby the accuracy of the\r\nsmall arm with the moral effect of canister. Thus, among others, the\r\n4-10 barreled _Gatling_ gun was invented in America in 1861, it being\r\nthe oldest representative of this type of weapon. In order to obtain\r\na weapon matching the Prussian _needle_ gun, Bavaria adopted the 4\r\nbarreled _Feldl_ gun and France the 25 barreled _mitrailleuse_.[274]\r\nThe name _canon à balles_, which was given the gun, sufficed to\r\nindicate the manner in which it was intended to be used. As these guns\r\nfrequently failed in action, offered the same target and required the\r\nsame equipment and approximately the same road space as field guns,\r\nthe states who had first adopted them, finally decided to dispense\r\nwith them on European theaters of war. The further development of\r\nmachine guns was not especially accelerated by the fact that the French\r\n_mitrailleuses_ had not fulfilled the expectations entertained for\r\nthem during the Franco-German war, isolated cases excepted,[275] and\r\nthat they were quickly silenced by the German artillery, which was\r\nequipped only with percussion shell, as soon as their position was\r\nascertained. Thus, these guns seemed useful only in colonial wars and\r\non board war ships for warding off torpedo boats. Although they took up\r\nvery little room when in position, they were not considered useful for\r\nflank defense in fortresses, on account of the frequent breakdowns. In\r\naddition to their height, other defects developed; for example, they\r\ncould obtain only a very insignificant rate of fire, betrayed their\r\nposition by the powder smoke, and lacked the means for ascertaining\r\nranges.\r\n\r\n    [274] The 25 barreled _mitrailleuse_, cal. 13 mm., fired volleys at\r\n  the rate of 125 rounds per minute. Its fire was considered equivalent\r\n  to that of 50 needle guns; its weight was 1,485 kg., each of its\r\n  four horses pulling 371 kg.; its maximum range was 3,000 m. Its most\r\n  favorable, practical range 500-1,500 m.--A glaring defect of the\r\n  gun was that fire pauses occurred whenever cartridges were fed into\r\n  the slot and that the lateral spread of its cone of dispersion was\r\n  extremely small.\r\n\r\n    [275] Battle of Gravelotte. _Gen. St. W._, pp. 705-712, 723 and\r\n  781. The employment of three Gatling guns in rear of the park wall\r\n  of Yoré, during the defense of the plateau of Auvours. (_Revue\r\n  d’artillerie_, 1900, p. 297; _Gen. St. W._, IV, p. 817).\r\n\r\nThe situation changed entirely when a practicable, smokeless powder\r\nwas invented, and Hiram Maxim, an American, succeeded in utilizing the\r\nenergy of the recoil (a factor neglected up to that time, although\r\nannoying to the marksman) for opening the breech, inserting a fresh\r\ncartridge into the chamber, closing the breech, and automatically\r\nfiring the piece.[276] Through this invention it became possible to\r\nfire a maximum of 900 and an average of 500 rounds per minute, from a\r\nsingle barrel moving laterally back and forth. The desire to obtain a\r\nstill greater rate of fire was checked effectively, because of the fact\r\nthat with such an increase the danger of jamming increased and the use\r\nof infantry ammunition was precluded. The water in the jacket continues\r\nto be a decided drawback to this type of gun, for it is not always\r\neasily procured, impairs the mechanism by freezing, makes it difficult\r\nto change barrels, and constitutes a considerable weight. If cooling\r\nthe barrel by means of water were to be dispensed with, the accuracy of\r\nthe piece would rapidly diminish, and, after 1000 rounds of continuous\r\nfire, bullets would tumble even at short ranges. At the present time\r\nwater is still the most effective means of cooling the barrel.[277]\r\n\r\n    [276] Of the other types the following may here be mentioned:\r\n  _Hotchkiss_ (France), insufficient cooling of the barrel by air;\r\n  _Schwarzlose_ (Austria), machine gun model 7, a very simple weapon\r\n  which has only a single spring.\r\n\r\n    [277] In the _Colt_ Machine Gun, which is not water-cooled, after\r\n  500 rounds had been fired, a cartridge inserted into the piece\r\n  exploded in seven seconds, and cartridges placed in the chamber a\r\n  quarter of an hour later exploded in 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nMachine guns fire ordinary small arms ammunition carried in loops on a\r\ncanvass belt (weighing 1 kg. when empty), which is generally capable\r\nof holding 250 rounds of 8 mm. cartridges weighing 8.315 kg. These\r\nbelts are very carefully manufactured, the material being shrunk, so\r\nas to prevent their shrinking when in use. Two men can refill an empty\r\nbelt with 8 mm. cartridges in seven minutes, according to Swedish\r\nexperiments, while a belt filling machine can refill one in a still\r\nshorter time. The rate of fire of machine guns is approximately 500\r\nrounds per minute. They are variously mounted,[278] according to\r\ncircumstances, on sleds (in which the gun rests on a frame similar\r\nto that of a wheelbarrow), on tripods, or, for mountain warfare, on\r\nbasket frames. Although the greatest readiness for firing was obtained\r\nwith guns mounted on cavalry carriages (two-wheeled carts, similar to\r\nlimbers, and equipped with shafts), which also permitted the greatest\r\namount of ammunition to be carried along, these guns offered such a\r\nhigh target that their use, in an infantry action, was entirely out of\r\nthe question, leading only to their being quickly silenced. Another\r\ndefect was that the guns were unable to follow immediately upon the\r\nheels of the organization to which they were attached. Guns mounted\r\non light tripods possess the least readiness for firing, as the gun\r\nmust be dismounted during each change of position; but tripods are\r\nindispensable in mountain warfare. In India a tripod frame on wheels\r\nis employed. The basket frame, which is very light and is carried on\r\nthe back of a soldier, affords nothing but a rest for the gun. This\r\ntype of mount has the disadvantage of necessitating, in reality,\r\nfreehand firing when the barrel is supported near the muzzle; that\r\nthe operator, when firing continuously, becomes greatly fatigued,\r\nand that the accuracy suffers in consequence thereof. The advantages\r\nof the tripod and the wheeled carriage have been skillfully combined\r\nin the carriage adopted in Germany. In this the gun rests on a sled;\r\nthis is in turn supported by the carriage proper, which is wheeled.\r\nIn exceptional cases the gun may be fired from the carriage, but\r\nordinarily it is fired from the sled, which is detached from the\r\ncarriage for that purpose. This sled permits the gun to be laid at any\r\ndesired height and enables it to follow the infantry anywhere during an\r\naction.[279]\r\n\r\n    [278]\r\n\r\n  British cavalry machine gun with mount                   152.3 kg.\r\n  Machine gun with tripod       }               16.5 + 18 = 34.5  „\r\n  Machine gun with basket frame } latest model              35.0  „\r\n  Machine gun with sled         }               16.5 + 24 = 40.5  „\r\n\r\n    [279] The following complement per gun is considered necessary:\r\n\r\n  Germany       14¹⁄₂ men   9 horses.\r\n  Switzerland    8¹⁄₂ men  12 horses.\r\n\r\n  In the Russo-Japanese war the machine gun detachments of the Russian\r\n  cavalry were equipped with _Rexer_ guns which can scarcely be\r\n  considered machine guns owing to their slow rate of fire and extreme\r\n  heating of the barrel.\r\n\r\nMachine guns can be transported upon larger vehicles capable of\r\nbeing unlimbered; they can also be carried on pack horses or other\r\npack animals, and for short distances by men. Although pack animal\r\ntransportation enables the guns to follow the troops anywhere, the\r\namount of ammunition that can be carried along is limited, and the\r\nopening of fire is retarded, since gun and tripod must first be\r\nassembled; the opening of fire may even be delayed when a pack animal\r\nfalls; ammunition cannot be carried on the gun; and the animals get\r\nsore backs even if pack saddles are carefully adjusted.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE POWER OF MACHINE GUNS.\r\n\r\nThe machine gun is noted for its adaptability to any terrain, and the\r\nconstancy of its high rate of fire as compared with that of a body of\r\ninfantry, which decreases with the range, the diminishing visibility\r\nof the target, and prolonged fire. On the other hand, a single jamming\r\ncan make a machine gun valueless, at least for the time being. For\r\nthis reason, the Germans employ machine guns only in platoons, as a\r\nrule, and the Swiss let both guns of a platoon fire simultaneously\r\nonly in exceptional cases. Theoretically, the maximum rate of fire of\r\n600 rounds per minute will rarely be attained; and 200-300 rounds per\r\nminute will usually suffice against prone targets. In Germany volley\r\nand continuous fire are employed; fire by a single piece is used only\r\nto ward off patrols when the machine guns do not want to betray their\r\nposition.[280]\r\n\r\n    [280] The following kinds of fire are used in the countries named\r\n  below:\r\n\r\n    Austria: Single shots; volleys (20-25 rounds); fire by a single\r\n  piece.\r\n\r\n    Switzerland: Fire by a single piece; volleys (20-30 rounds); rapid\r\n  fire (volleys of 100 rounds); and fire at will (both pieces of a\r\n  platoon simultaneously employing rapid fire). The last-named is\r\n  only employed in exceptional cases, for example, when the danger is\r\n  imminent and when favorable opportunities offer.\r\n\r\nA volley consists of about 25 rounds and is followed by a pause for\r\nobserving the effect of the fire. It is employed in adjusting the fire\r\nupon difficult targets in rolling country. Fire for effect consists,\r\nas a general rule, of “continuous fire,” and is interrupted only when\r\nthe tactical situation requires it. The water in the jacket should be\r\nrenewed and oiling attended to during the pauses in the fire, whether\r\nthese grow out of the tactical situation, or are made necessary by\r\ntechnical considerations.\r\n\r\nThe fire is either directed upon a point (concentrated fire), the\r\nelevation and direction of the piece being fixed, or it is distributed\r\nover the entire target or over a designated part of the same (sweeping,\r\nand progressive fire).[281]\r\n\r\n    [281] For example, when sweeping the crest of the parapet of a line\r\n  of trenches, or the edge of a wood, both hands move the gun slowly\r\n  and evenly from side to side. When searching an area in the direction\r\n  of depth and obliquely (progressive fire with sweeping), the left\r\n  hand gives the gun the proper horizontal direction, while the right\r\n  manipulates the slow motion elevating gear. When firing on rapidly\r\n  moving targets--for example skirmish lines advancing by rushes--or\r\n  targets advancing over rolling country, both the traversing and\r\n  elevating movements may be unclamped. The rapidity with which the gun\r\n  is moved, when sweeping or searching, depends upon the range and the\r\n  kind of target on which the fire is directed. As a rule, the piece\r\n  is moved slowly and steadily. The accuracy of the fire is impaired\r\n  when the gun is moved too rapidly. When the fire is well observed,\r\n  it might be advantageous, in exceptional cases, when firing against\r\n  either stationary or moving targets, to direct the gun, without\r\n  aiming, after the bullets have been seen to hit their mark, by\r\n  properly manipulating the elevating and traversing apparatus while\r\n  the firing is in progress.\r\n\r\nThe ballistic properties of the gun are the same as those of the\r\ninfantry rifle.[282]\r\n\r\n    [282] The destructive power of the projectiles fired from a machine\r\n  gun, as they strike within a small space, is, of course, much greater\r\n  than that of the scattered projectiles of a body of infantry. Trees\r\n  having a circumference of 30 cm. are felled by machine gun fire in\r\n  about 15 seconds at a range of 450 m.\r\n\r\nIn the machine gun an important factor in the dispersion of infantry\r\nfire--flinching and errors in aiming--is eliminated, while the heating\r\nof its barrel and the vibrations of its carriage in continuous fire do\r\nnot produce a corresponding increase in dispersion. On this account\r\nthe cone of dispersion of the machine gun is more compact than that\r\nof the infantry rifle and its accuracy at long ranges is therefore\r\nconsiderably greater than that of the latter.[283] Firing tests\r\nindicate that the accuracy of machine gun fire diminishes only very\r\nslightly with increasing range, provided the appropriate elevation is\r\nused.[284]\r\n\r\n    [283] According to Austrian experiments the depth of the beaten\r\n  zone of a machine gun is only ¹⁄₃ to ¹⁄₂ that produced by the fire of\r\n  a platoon of infantry.\r\n\r\n    [284] The following average results were obtained in experiments\r\n  made at the Musketry School, while firing on infantry targets\r\n  advancing alternately at quick and double time:\r\n\r\n  At ranges from 2000-1600 m.   1.72% hits\r\n   „   „     „   1500-1200 m.   2.53%  „\r\n\r\n  Firing against disappearing head targets placed at intervals of\r\n  0.60-0.70 m.:\r\n\r\n  At 600-800  m.   1.89% hits „  800-1100 m.   1.69%  „\r\n\r\n  In firing first with an elevation of 1800, then with one of 1750 m.\r\n  (the range being 2000-1600 m. and 254 rounds being expended per gun),\r\n  on 50 advancing, kneeling targets, placed at intervals of 1 m. 3.10%\r\n  hits were obtained and 52% figures were placed out of action in 1¹⁄₂\r\n  minutes.\r\n\r\n  In firing at the same targets for 2¹⁄₃ minutes, with an elevation of\r\n  1900 m. (304 rounds expended), the result dropped to 0.3% hits and\r\n  8.3% figures placed out of action.\r\n\r\nIn war the influence of the compact cone of dispersion will be still\r\nmore potent, for we will then have to reckon with a single, specially\r\nselected machine gun marksman who is well protected, while the\r\nexcitement of battle will produce a far different impression upon an\r\norganization composed of men differing materially from each other. The\r\ncompactness of the cone of dispersion of the machine gun requires\r\nthat the appropriate elevation be used if the fire is to be effective\r\nagainst well concealed prone skirmishers. This can be accomplished only\r\nin part by employing range finders. Since the probable error of these\r\ninstruments is ±5% of the range, this determination is so inaccurate\r\nfor machine gun fire that nothing remains but to increase the\r\ndispersion artificially. When it is impossible to observe the strike of\r\nthe bullets, the dispersion may be artificially increased by employing\r\ncombined sights, two in a single platoon and three in a machine gun\r\nbattery (company), and above all by sweeping. The employment of\r\ncombined sights would appear to be too rigid a method; sweeping fire is\r\nat any rate better.[285]\r\n\r\n    [285] Lieutenant-General ROHNE, _Schieszlehre_, 2nd Ed. p. 185, et\r\n  seq.\r\n\r\nFrom general ballistic data, Lieutenant-General ROHNE[286] computes\r\nthat the following results would be obtained by a machine gun and a\r\ndetachment of skirmishers when firing with the appropriate elevation at\r\na broad target 1 m. high:--\r\n\r\n              Machine     Detachment\r\n                gun     of skirmishers\r\n  At  500 m.   32.4       16.8% hits\r\n  „  1000 „    15.3        8.1%  „\r\n  „  1500 „    10.2        5.1%  „\r\n  „  2000 „     6.4        3.2%  „\r\n\r\n    [286] _Jahrbücher für Armee und Marine_, 1901, IV, p. 268.\r\n\r\nThis nearly double superiority is reversed, however, when the\r\nappropriate elevation is not used:\r\n\r\n  ======+========================================================\r\n        |Firing on a target 1 m. high, the following percentages\r\n        | of hits may be expected when the error in estimating\r\n        |                     the range is--\r\n  Range.|     50 m.   |    100 m.   |    150 m.   |    200 m.\r\n        +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------\r\n        |Machine|Skir-|Machine|Skir-|Machine|Skir-|Machine|Skir-\r\n        | guns. |mish-| guns. |mish-| guns. |mish-| guns. |mish-\r\n    m.  |       | ers.|       | ers.|       | ers.|       | ers.\r\n  ------+-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------\r\n   500  |  27.5 | 16.0|  19.0 | 13.8|   7.0 | 11.7|   1.3 | 7.3\r\n  1000  |   9.2 |  6.8|   2.0 |  4.8|   0.2 |  2.7|   --  | 1.0\r\n  1500  |   3.6 |  3.9|   0.2 |  1.8|    -- |  0.5|   --  | 0.1\r\n  2000  |   1.7 |  2.2|    -- |  0.8|    -- |  0.2|   --  |  --\r\n  ------+-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------\r\n\r\nFrom this it follows that the good qualities of the machine gun can be\r\nutilized to the fullest advantage only when the appropriate elevation\r\nis used. When this is not accurately known, the fire effect of the\r\nmachine gun drops down to zero more quickly than that of a skirmish\r\nline. Where local conditions are at all favorable, the determination of\r\nthe appropriate elevation is facilitated by observing the strike of the\r\nprojectiles in “volley fire.”\r\n\r\n  According to British firing tests, at ranges from 500-1000 yards an\r\n  error of estimation of 100 yards, reduces the effect of the fire\r\n  50 per cent. According to firing tests 75% of all shots fired by a\r\n  machine gun and body of infantry are distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  =====+==================+==================+====================\r\n       |   Machine gun.   |   Detachment of  |Errors of estimation\r\n       |                  |     infantry.    | permissible for the\r\n   At  |Depth of 75% strip|Depth of 75% strip|    machine gun.\r\n   m.  |       m.         |        m.        |        m.\r\n  -----+------------------+------------------+--------------------\r\n   450 |      112         |       192        |     54 = 12 %\r\n   900 |       63         |       108        |     31 = 3.5%\r\n  1350 |       54         |        90        |     27 = 2  %\r\n  1800 |       67         |       140        |     31 = 1.8%\r\n  -----+------------------+------------------+--------------------\r\n\r\nIt is clearly apparent that the permissible error of the range finder\r\nis smaller than the depth of the vertical dispersion strip covered by\r\n75% of the bullets.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of hitting a target lodged in some feature of the\r\nterrain requires that the machine gun be used first of all against\r\nlarge targets that are visible for a short time only. When the\r\nappropriate elevation is used, a decisive effect may be confidently\r\ncounted on within a short space of time; when an inappropriate\r\nelevation is used and the fire is not properly observed, only\r\naccidental hits can, as a rule, be expected, even when the fire\r\nis directed on tall, dense targets. When the fire is directed on\r\nskirmishers lying down, the effect produced is not commensurate with\r\nthe amount of ammunition expended, and a slight error in the elevation\r\nused may nullify the effect entirely. A straight line of trenches,\r\nwhich is plainly visible, is, on the other hand, an eminently favorable\r\ntarget. The heating of the barrel, and the difficulty of replenishing\r\nammunition and renewing the water in the jacket, tend to work against a\r\nparticipation of machine guns in a protracted fire fight. The machine\r\ngun is not at all suited for carrying on a prolonged fire action.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to determine the relative combat value of a body\r\nof infantry as compared with that of a machine gun. One will not be far\r\nwrong in placing this value between 50 and 60 men.\r\n\r\nIn experimental field firing at the Swiss Infantry Musketry School, it\r\nwas demonstrated that 30-40 skirmishers almost in every case rapidly\r\ngained the upper hand over a machine gun in the open, at 900 m., but\r\nthat the infantrymen had small chances of success when the position of\r\nthe machine gun could not be accurately determined. In Switzerland a\r\nmachine gun is considered equivalent to 50 infantrymen. Skirmishers are\r\nthe most difficult target for machine guns to fight, and, at the same\r\ntime, they are the most dangerous. When the fire is well observed, a\r\ngood effect can, indeed, still be counted on, when the fire is directed\r\nat prone skirmishers at ranges up to 1000 m., but this is not true when\r\nthe fire cannot be observed; in the last mentioned case, no effect\r\nworth mentioning is produced.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= In a field firing test (which was repeated four times)\r\n  between a machine gun (gun pointer covered by a shield) and 30\r\n  infantrymen, the following results were obtained at 600 m. in 1¹⁄₂\r\n  minutes:\r\n\r\n  Infantrymen   120 rounds   10 hits (9%)\r\n  Machine gun   215   „      14  „   (7%)[287]\r\n\r\n    [287] Firing tests of the Army Musketry School at Bruck, a.d.\r\n  Leitha, 1905. _Streffleur_, Apl. 1906, p. 524.\r\n\r\n  =England.= At the Infantry School at Hythe, in a firing test at 300\r\n  yards, lasting 5 minutes--perhaps the longest period during which\r\n  continuous fire is possible--the power of a Maxim gun was found to\r\n  be equivalent to 60 rifles. In field firing this comparative power\r\n  dropped down to 25-35 rifles. In this connection, it should be\r\n  borne in mind that moral influences do not make themselves felt in\r\n  firing under peace conditions, and that, on the other hand, a single\r\n  favorable hit can place the machine gun out of action for a long\r\n  period, while the skirmishers can keep up the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. INFANTRY VERSUS MACHINE GUNS.\r\n\r\nIt will rarely be possible to concentrate upon a machine gun battery\r\nof six guns a fire equivalent to its own. Because of the small\r\ntarget offered by machine guns, it is necessary for a firing line to\r\nconcentrate its fire upon one machine gun at a time, thus gradually\r\nsilencing the battery in detail. This procedure is feasible because\r\nit is very difficult for the machine guns to reach with their fire\r\nall parts of a well concealed skirmish line. The normal relation,\r\nunfavorable for the infantry, changes in its favor, however, as machine\r\nguns cannot keep up a high rate of fire for a prolonged period, even\r\nwhen nothing is considered but ammunition supply; as serious breaks are\r\nespecially apt to occur when the gun is worked to its maximum capacity;\r\nand as the ammunition expended in one minute (3600 rounds) cannot\r\nproduce an effect unless not only the correct range but also the proper\r\nelevation is accurately known.\r\n\r\nThe fight against machine guns may be advantageously conducted\r\naccording to the following principles:[288]\r\n\r\n1. Infantry skirmishers should conceal themselves so well that it will\r\nbe difficult for the hostile machine gun battery to find them. Color of\r\nimmediate vicinity (shade) and background should be considered; platoon\r\nand other leaders must not stand upright; objects that are clearly\r\nvisible should be avoided.\r\n\r\n2. It should be made difficult for the hostile machine guns to observe\r\ntheir fire (ricochets) and to measure the range. (No prominent features\r\nthat would facilitate such measurements should be located near the\r\ninfantry position).\r\n\r\n3. The firing line, as far as this is possible, should not be\r\ncontinuous; the several parts of the line should be posted in echelon.\r\n\r\n4. Kinds of fire: Lively fire at will should be used.\r\n\r\n5. Expenditure of ammunition: At least 600 rounds should be expended\r\nagainst each machine gun.\r\n\r\n6. At the outset a single company should concentrate its fire upon a\r\nsingle machine gun, picking out the one that is most clearly visible.\r\nMachine guns on the flanks are not good targets, as a strong wind may\r\ndeflect the fire directed upon them.\r\n\r\n    [288] Switzerland: Machine guns, “on account of their small gun\r\n  squads, are more sensitive to losses than artillery. They cannot\r\n  adjust their fire so easily as artillery, but, when once on the\r\n  target, the effect of their fire is great.\r\n\r\n    “The principles governing the combat against artillery are\r\n  applicable, in general, to the fight against machine guns. It may be\r\n  assumed that at medium ranges, one platoon of infantry will suffice\r\n  for silencing one machine gun, provided the platoon of infantry\r\n  fights the action under favorable conditions. At short ranges, a few\r\n  good marksmen suffice for silencing a machine gun. For this reason\r\n  selected men are sent forward, when the situation permits, to sneak\r\n  up to the machine guns and to pick off the men serving them.”\r\n\r\nThe following rules, governing the conduct of infantry when exposed to\r\nmachine gun fire, may be deduced from the above:\r\n\r\nEven skirmish lines cannot continue their advance over terrain devoid\r\nof cover, when exposed within a range of 1500 m. to the unsubdued fire\r\nof machine guns; nothing remains but for them to lie down, and to gain\r\nground to the front in groups, or one by one.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of route columns. They can only deploy to the right\r\nand left front at double time, and take cover.\r\n\r\nThe most unsuitable formation under machine gun fire is the column of\r\nplatoons, whether lying down or in motion.[289]\r\n\r\n    [289] Within ³⁄₄ to 1 minute a column of platoons (lying down)\r\n  sustained an average of 4.22% hits at 1400 m. and 4.31% hits at\r\n  900-1100 m. with 42 and 32%, respectively, figures placed out of\r\n  action.\r\n\r\nIf the column of platoons is reached by effective machine gun fire,\r\nwhen lying down, line must be formed. The men must not rise, however,\r\nto execute this movement, but the platoons should crawl forward into\r\nline. For the men to rise would mean annihilation.\r\n\r\nThe low target offered by machine guns makes them a difficult target\r\nfor field artillery to hit, in spite of the accuracy with which the\r\nlatter can adjust its fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. MACHINE GUNS IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\nThe German machine gun (drawn by 4 horses driven from the saddle) is\r\nmounted upon a sled which forms the firing frame. On the march, this\r\nsled is placed on a wheeled carriage, from which it must first be\r\ndetached (10-15 seconds) before the gun is used; in exceptional cases,\r\nthe gun can be fired from the wheeled carriage.\r\n\r\nThe gun commander is mounted. Two of the gunners are seated on the axle\r\nchest of the carriage, their carbines buckled to the gun carriage; two\r\nare seated on the limber chest, their carbines slung over their backs.\r\nWhen surprised by a direct attack, all the men that can be spared form\r\nas skirmishers in the intervals between the guns of the machine gun\r\nbattery. The machine gun can be served by a single man. The water in\r\nthe jacket need not necessarily be renewed when the gun is fired for a\r\nshort time only.\r\n\r\nThe machine guns can be used on any terrain passable for infantry. When\r\ndetached from the wheeled carriage they can even surmount considerable\r\nobstacles. In action, they present no larger target than skirmishers\r\nfighting under similar conditions, and are capable of offering more\r\nresistance than infantry.\r\n\r\nThe sled can be carried or drawn by the men for short distances. The\r\nammunition, placed in belts holding 250 rounds each, and packed in six\r\nboxes, is similarly drawn on an ammunition sled. If the conditions\r\npermit, the guns may be drawn by horses.\r\n\r\nThe “fighting battery” consists of six guns, formed into three\r\nplatoons, and an ammunition platoon (three ammunition wagons and one\r\nstore wagon); the combat train consists of officers’ and other led\r\nhorses. The field train consists of one baggage wagon, one ration\r\n(commissary) wagon, one forage wagon, and a second store wagon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Machine Guns in Germany.\r\n\r\nLead Team Hitched to Gun.\r\n\r\nCarrying the Machine Guns.]\r\n\r\nThe movements and gaits of a machine gun battery are the same as those\r\nof a field battery: the order in line, at close or extended intervals,\r\nin which the guns are abreast, the intervals between them, measured\r\nfrom center to center, being 5 and 17 paces, respectively. The order in\r\nline, at extended intervals, is used in moving to the front or rear;\r\nthe order in line, at close intervals, for assembly, for movements in\r\nthat formation, for parking, and for parade. The section column[290] is\r\nthe principal maneuver formation on the battlefield; it is employed as\r\nan assembly formation on a road, and as route column. (Par. 320 German\r\nF. S. R.). In section column the guns follow each other at a distance\r\nof four paces. In addition to this column, a column of platoons is\r\nused, in which the platoons follow each other at a distance of 22\r\npaces. (This may be reduced to 6 paces).\r\n\r\n    [290] The guns are placed in rear of each other, the ammunition\r\n  wagons and other vehicles bring up the rear. _Translator_.\r\n\r\nA machine gun battery has available 87,300 rounds of ammunition (10,500\r\nrounds with each gun and 8100 rounds in each ammunition wagon, or a\r\ntotal of 14,550 rounds per gun), which may be drawn forward to the\r\nfiring position upon sleds, in boxes holding 250 rounds each. The\r\nammunition wagons are refilled from the ammunition wagons of the light\r\nammunition columns of the cavalry division and from the wagons of the\r\ninfantry ammunition columns marked with a red stripe, which carry\r\nammunition for machine gun units. A reserve machine gun is carried with\r\nthe ammunition column.\r\n\r\nThe machine gun battery combines high infantry fire power\r\n(approximately equivalent to that of the skirmishers of a German\r\ncavalry regiment, armed with carbines, or to that of 4-6 platoons of\r\ninfantry)[291] with instant readiness for firing, and a mobility which\r\nenables it to follow the mounted arms anywhere. The chance of producing\r\na sudden fire effect within a short space of time must be especially\r\nutilized, and, therefore, an endeavor should be made to put entire\r\nmachine gun batteries into the first line. The employment of single\r\nguns is precluded owing to the danger of breakdowns, and the employment\r\nof platoons is especially proper on the defensive as well as in action\r\nat short range.\r\n\r\n    [291] A German cavalry regiment at peace strength numbers from 552\r\n  to 576 sabers: a platoon of infantry (on a peace footing) numbers\r\n  from 48 to 53 men.\r\n\r\n    In making a comparison between a cavalry regiment and a machine gun\r\n  battery, it must be borne in mind that horse holders are deducted\r\n  from the strength given for a cavalry regiment. _Translator_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Order in Line\r\n\r\n(extended intervals).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Column of Platoons\r\n\r\n(closed up).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section Column.\r\n\r\n(Route Column).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Explanation of Symbols used:]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Order in Line\r\n\r\n(close intervals).]\r\n\r\nThe duties of machine guns naturally grow out of their tactical\r\nadvantages. Their fire power should be saved for decisive moments, when\r\nthe development of strong fire power at short ranges is requisite, and\r\nwhen the available time and the situation do not permit of pushing\r\ninfantry into action. The machine gun batteries, which constitute\r\nan independent arm, and which are assigned to cavalry and infantry\r\ndivisions, are best adapted for these duties.\r\n\r\nThe heavy matériel and the teams designed for rapid movements make the\r\nmachine gun battery less suited for employment in infantry combat,\r\nwhere such a high degree of mobility is not so necessary. In the\r\nbattle on the Shaho an employment of machine guns by platoons in\r\nthe first line, came about quite naturally. The guns prepared the\r\nassault, reinforced weak points, and supported the advance. In Germany,\r\nprovisional machine gun companies consisting of six two-horse machine\r\nguns, driven from the carriage (these guns cannot be fired from their\r\ncarriages), have been adopted for this purpose. These machine gun\r\ncompanies are principally an auxiliary weapon of the infantry, and,\r\ndistributed by platoons to the battalions, or sent into action as a\r\nsingle unit by the regimental commander, they serve the purpose of\r\naugmenting the fire of the infantry.\r\n\r\nMovements at increased gaits are possible in exceptional cases only;\r\nas a rule, the guns follow the infantry at a walk, and in combats\r\nterminating in a defeat, it may frequently be impossible to keep them\r\nfrom falling into the hands of the enemy. The permanent assignment of\r\nmachine guns to battalions does not seem to be advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. GOING INTO POSITION.\r\n\r\nThe principles which govern the reconnaissance and occupation of a\r\nposition by field artillery are applicable also to machine guns.\r\nThe tactical situation determines whether the guns should move\r\ninto position under cover or in the open. As a rule, the interval\r\nbetween two adjacent machine guns in line is 17 paces; but the proper\r\nutilization of favorable cover does not preclude posting the guns close\r\ntogether. It may likewise be advantageous to post the guns in echelon\r\non the flanks.\r\n\r\nIn action the carriages remain, as a rule, in the nearest cover in\r\nrear of the line. The advance from this point is effected by the men\r\ncarrying or dragging the detached guns and ammunition sleds; under\r\ncertain circumstances, it may also be advisable to have the guns\r\nor ammunition sleds drawn forward by single horses (mounts of gun\r\ncommanders). On level ground the ammunition platoon and the wheeled\r\ncarriages of the machine guns take post in rear of and as close as\r\npossible to the guns. Whether the two groups are combined, or whether\r\nthe machine gun carriages should occupy the nearest, and the ammunition\r\nwagons the more distant cover, depends upon the available cover. The\r\ncommander of the machine gun carriages sends full ammunition sleds\r\nto the firing line at an early moment and has empty boxes and belts\r\nbrought back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Machine Gun Platoon Crawling Into Position.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Range Finder. A Machine Gun Platoon in Position.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Machine Gun Platoon Intrenched.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE FIRE FIGHT.\r\n\r\n  The machine gun. squad consists of one gun commander and four\r\n  gunners, numbers 1-4; number 2 is the gun pointer. The gun commander\r\n  sees that the gun is set up for the prone, sitting, or kneeling fire\r\n  position, according to the terrain, supervises the service of the\r\n  gun, which can be served in any position of the body, and removes all\r\n  obstructions that interfere with its effective use. The gun pointer\r\n  handles the gun, _i.e._, he loads it, sets the sight, aims and fires\r\n  it. No. 3, who lies to the right of the gun pointer, assists the\r\n  latter in these duties, places a box of ammunition on the right of\r\n  the gun, and feeds the ammunition belt into the slot. When necessary,\r\n  he takes the place of the gun pointer. No. 1 lies in rear of the gun\r\n  pointer, keeps his eye on the battery and platoon commanders, and\r\n  transmits their orders to the gun commander and gun pointer. No. 4\r\n  has charge of the replenishment of ammunition; he takes cover or lies\r\n  down 20 paces in rear of, or on a flank of the gun.\r\n\r\n  The range finders, without special orders to that effect, measure\r\n  the range to targets as they appear, or to fixed points, and call\r\n  it out to the battery commander. The battery commander designates\r\n  the target, the range, and the kind of fire to be used. The platoon\r\n  commanders assign a section of the target to each of their guns,\r\n  designate the elevation that is to be used, and supervise the service\r\n  of the guns; they are especially held responsible that the fire\r\n  is directed upon the proper target. Platoon commanders constantly\r\n  observe through their field glasses the strike of the bullets and\r\n  the enemy. The commander of the gun carriages is charged with their\r\n  supervision; he constantly sends forward ammunition, and, when\r\n  necessary, men and matériel, into the firing position. When the\r\n  detached guns change position, he follows the movement under cover\r\n  with the gun carriages, bringing them as close to the firing position\r\n  as possible.\r\n\r\n  After machine gun batteries had been employed at maneuvers as an\r\n  auxiliary arm of the cavalry, they did especially good work in the\r\n  fights in Southwest Africa,[292] where they were not opposed by\r\n  artillery.\r\n\r\n    [292] _Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1904, Nos. 136, 139 and 140.\r\n\r\n  Through their ability to follow a skirmish line into the densest\r\n  thickets, they were a valuable support to the infantry in the close\r\n  country in which the African fights took place, where artillery of\r\n  necessity had to fail owing to absence of a clear field of view. It\r\n  was demonstrated, however, that the machine gun squads became so\r\n  engrossed in the work of serving their guns that supporting troops\r\n  had to guard them against surprise.\r\n\r\n  In the engagement at the =Waterberg=, the machine guns did splendid\r\n  work in meeting, with an effective volley fire, the sudden, energetic\r\n  attacks made by the Hereros against the flank and rear of the\r\n  Germans. In two critical moments, during the attack against the left\r\n  flank of the advance guard, and during the attack made with a yell\r\n  against the right and rear of headquarters, it was principally due\r\n  to the machine guns that the enemy, who had come within short range,\r\n  was repulsed. Participants of this fight believed that the Hereros\r\n  did not dare to make a real attack when machine guns went into action\r\n  against them. It had been impossible to avoid using single machine\r\n  guns. Just as the enemy was making an attack upon the 11th Company,\r\n  machine gun No. 3 (2nd Machine Gun Battery), which had done splendid\r\n  work, broke down. This was the only case of jamming that occurred.\r\n  Although exposed to a galling hostile fire, the gun commander managed\r\n  to change barrels in 30 seconds, and then to resume the firing. The\r\n  2nd Machine Gun Battery expended 20,775 rounds of ammunition; the\r\n  expenditure of the different guns varied between 7350 and 120 rounds,\r\n  according to the part taken by them in the action. The ammunition\r\n  supply was certain and steady; no shortage of ammunition, not even a\r\n  temporary one, occurred anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. MACHINE GUNS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\n  =Switzerland.= In 1892 Switzerland began to organize four mounted\r\n  Maxim machine gun companies, which were assigned to the weak\r\n  cavalry brigades (consisting of six troops[293]) on account of the\r\n  defensive role of the Swiss cavalry and the lack of batteries of\r\n  horse artillery. Three machine gun companies were assigned to the\r\n  fortifications on the St. Gotthard and one to St. Moritz for the\r\n  purpose of augmenting the fire of the advanced positions belonging to\r\n  those fortifications, and to cover the approaches thereto.\r\n\r\n    [293] Eskadrons.\r\n\r\n  A Maxim machine gun company consists of 6 officers, 105\r\n  non-commissioned officers and privates, 99 horses (24 pack horses\r\n  and 24 draft horses), 8 guns mounted on tripods, and 7 vehicles (two\r\n  of these are two-horse supply and baggage wagons, one four-horse\r\n  field forge with field kitchen, 4 two-horse ammunition wagons, each\r\n  carrying 15,520 rounds of ammunition). The guns and the ammunition\r\n  are carried on pack animals. A packed gun horse carries a load of 108\r\n  kg. inclusive of 5 kg. of oats. An ammunition horse carries a load\r\n  of 123 kg. inclusive of 5 kg. of oats and 8 ammunition boxes (each\r\n  holding 250 rounds, or a total of 2000 rounds weighing 90.5 kg.). A\r\n  machine gun company of eight guns is divided into four platoons, each\r\n  consisting of two guns and four ammunition horses, and the combat\r\n  train, consisting of four ammunition wagons and the field kitchen.\r\n  Every gun is commanded by a “gun chief,” and two of the five men\r\n  belonging to the gun squad are horse holders. After the command\r\n  “halt” has been given, 1-1¹⁄₂ minutes are required to get the gun\r\n  ready for firing. The company carries 5940 rounds of ammunition for\r\n  each gun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Switzerland.\r\n\r\nMachine Gun and Ammunition Horse.\r\n\r\nGun Commander and Gun Ready to Fire.]\r\n\r\n  Route column from line is formed by the guns moving successively\r\n  in the proper direction, the two ammunition pack animals following\r\n  directly in rear of the gun to which they belong. The company takes\r\n  up a road space of 150 m. For movements off the road the company may\r\n  move in “mass,” or with the platoons in “combat formation.” When\r\n  in “mass” the platoons, each in route column, are abreast, with\r\n  intervals of 10-20 paces between them. When the platoons are in\r\n  “combat formation,” the two guns of each are placed abreast at equal\r\n  intervals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Platoon In Route Column.]\r\n\r\n  The three machine gun companies assigned to the line of\r\n  fortifications consist of two to three platoons, each of four guns.\r\n  A platoon consists of 2 officers and 60 non-commissioned officers\r\n  and privates. The men are armed with rifles and equipped with alpine\r\n  sticks. “Gun carriers” (_Waffenwarte_) carry the gun basket, which\r\n  weighs 33 kg. The weight of the water in the jacket is only 1 kg.\r\n  “Ammunition carriers” (_Munitionswarte_) carry the ammunition in\r\n  specially constructed frames, each man carrying 500 rounds.\r\n\r\n  Kinds of fire: “_Fire by a single gun_” is employed at the opening of\r\n  an action to drive away patrols and reconnoitering officers, when it\r\n  is not desired to betray the presence of machine guns to the enemy.\r\n\r\n  “_Volley fire_” is the usual fire employed by machine guns and\r\n  corresponds to the volley fire of infantry. After the target and the\r\n  elevation have been designated, the platoon commander directs that\r\n  fire he opened by calling the name of the gun pointer who is to fire.\r\n  A pause is made after every series of 20-30 shots, which is used to\r\n  make necessary corrections.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the proper elevation has been determined, “_rapid fire_”\r\n  is opened. In this the _guns of a platoon fire alternately_. The fire\r\n  is delivered in series of 100 rounds, and the time during which one\r\n  of the guns is not firing is utilized by the non-commissioned officer\r\n  with it to examine and oil the mechanism.\r\n\r\n  The “_fire at will_” (continuous fire) of the machine guns\r\n  corresponds to the magazine fire of the infantry. _All the guns fire\r\n  simultaneously_ series of 50 to 100 rounds, interrupting the fire for\r\n  a moment at the end of each series for the purpose of examining and\r\n  oiling the mechanism; then they resume the fire with a new series of\r\n  50 to 100 rounds. On account of the great expenditure of ammunition\r\n  entailed, and also in order to prevent the premature deterioration\r\n  of the matériel, fire at will is used in exceptional cases only, for\r\n  example, when danger is imminent, or when favorable opportunities\r\n  offer.\r\n\r\n  “_Progressive fire_” may be employed against narrow, deep targets,\r\n  when the range could not be accurately determined. It may also be\r\n  employed for searching an area 100-200 m. deep.\r\n\r\n  =Austria= has begun to organize _cavalry and mountain machine gun\r\n  batteries_ consisting of four guns each. The machine gun Model 7\r\n  (_Schwarzlose_), with pack animal equipment, has been adopted. The\r\n  gun horse carries 500, and each of the two ammunition horses, 1500\r\n  rounds of ammunition. During mobilization two ammunition horses\r\n  are to be added for each gun. Mountain machine gun batteries are\r\n  similarly organized; each ammunition horse carries 2000 rounds of\r\n  ammunition. On the gun itself, and on the gun frame, 44 belts, each\r\n  holding 250 rounds, or a total of 11,000 rounds, are carried.[294]\r\n\r\n    [294] The Schwarzlose machine gun weighs 18 kg. exclusive of frame\r\n  and the water in the jacket. (The Maxim weighs 28 kg.).\r\n\r\n  The formations employed by the cavalry machine gun batteries are the\r\n  order in line (at close intervals), the combat order, and the route\r\n  column.\r\n\r\n  The mountain machine gun batteries, carrying guns and ammunition\r\n  upon pack horses, are equipped with tripod and basket mounts. These\r\n  machine gun batteries combine the system of mounting and carrying\r\n  employed by the Swiss cavalry and mountain machine gun companies.\r\n  Three pack animals are employed to transport each gun with its\r\n  ammunition. The gun squad consists of three men. Officers and\r\n  non-commissioned officers are mounted; the other men of the battery\r\n  are not. Unpacking the guns, posting them, and getting them in\r\n  readiness for firing, is managed in a similar manner as in the Swiss\r\n  machine gun companies.\r\n\r\n  The gun adopted for _infantry machine gun batteries_ is the light and\r\n  simple Schwarzlose machine gun, Model 7.\r\n\r\n              Springs   Parts of breech   Screws & Pins   Weights\r\n  Maxim          14           35                52        27.5 kg.\r\n  Schwarzlose     1           11                13        17.5 „\r\n\r\n  Tripod mounts and pack animal transportation are necessary in view\r\n  of Austrian theaters of war. The batteries consist of four machine\r\n  guns.\r\n\r\n  “The great length of modern battle fronts, and the gaps and local\r\n  combats along the latter, would seem to make a distribution of\r\n  machine guns along the entire front desirable. Attention is thereby\r\n  directed to organizing the machine guns to be employed with the\r\n  infantry as ‘Regimental Machine Guns.’ Such an organization would\r\n  best ensure the training of this new arm for the infantry combat and\r\n  the prompt attainment of an understanding of its employment.\r\n\r\n  “In the cavalry, the difficulties of organizing, training, and\r\n  employing machine guns are considerably greater than in the infantry.\r\n  These difficulties are best overcome by organizing the machine guns\r\n  assigned to cavalry into independent batteries, and placing them at\r\n  the disposal of the higher cavalry commanders.\r\n\r\n  “In determining upon the size of the machine gun batteries attached\r\n  to infantry, an attempt should be made to combine minimum size with\r\n  adequate fire effect and maximum mobility. Two machine guns would\r\n  seem to be almost the maximum number that should be posted at one\r\n  point in an infantry action. From a tactical point of view, it is,\r\n  moreover, undesirable to post a greater number at one point, because\r\n  gun shields, steam, etc. would frequently form too prominent a\r\n  target, for the hostile artillery to forego firing on it promptly and\r\n  with telling effect.\r\n\r\n  “In connection with the desire for more than two machine guns in each\r\n  infantry and Jäger organization--about two guns per battalion--the\r\n  tremendous increase in ammunition trains should be considered. It\r\n  would also be well to bear in mind that we have, as a matter of fact,\r\n  not even become accustomed to the numerous ammunition columns of our\r\n  rapid fire artillery.\r\n\r\n  “In the cavalry, the necessity of dividing a machine gun battery\r\n  for the purpose of assigning the parts thereof to brigades, and\r\n  of assigning machine guns to reconnaissance and other independent\r\n  detachments, must be reckoned with. When we bear in mind that single\r\n  machine guns are to be used only in exceptional cases, the machine\r\n  gun battery intended for the cavalry cannot well be made smaller than\r\n  four guns.”[295]\r\n\r\n    [295] _Streffleur_, January, 1908, p. 114, et seq.\r\n\r\n  =England.= During the =Boer war= 1-2 machine guns mounted on a high\r\n  carriage were assigned to each of the British battalions. These guns\r\n  were unsuited to employment in an infantry combat and were quickly\r\n  silenced. The campaign demonstrated that these guns could frequently\r\n  not be used, and that they stood idle in rear of the line. They were\r\n  not combined into detachments for the purpose of supporting the\r\n  attack, as should have been done, until the engagement at =Pieters\r\n  Hill= (27th Febr., 1900). On account of the long range at which these\r\n  guns came into action, the effect of their fire was indeed very\r\n  small, but, nevertheless, its moral effect impaired the steadiness\r\n  of the Boer aim. Since the great fire power of these guns can be\r\n  brought into play only when several of them are employed together,\r\n  it is not a good plan to assign single guns to cavalry regiments for\r\n  the purpose of supporting the dismounted line in action. Only the\r\n  commander of the entire force, and not each battalion commander,\r\n  is able to judge where the employment of machine guns would be\r\n  advantageous. The proposal to assign machine guns to the artillery\r\n  was not followed, as it was justly feared that the machine guns would\r\n  then be assigned tasks to which they were not adapted.\r\n\r\n  At the present time, each battalion has a machine gun platoon\r\n  consisting of two guns. Both guns with their tripods, and a portion\r\n  of the ammunition, are transported on one wagon drawn by two horses.\r\n  They are in addition equipped with a two-horse ammunition cart. The\r\n  complement consists of 1 non-commissioned officer, 15 privates, 1\r\n  saddle horse, and 4 draft horses.\r\n\r\n  Each battalion of mounted infantry has a machine gun platoon which is\r\n  similarly organized. Each of the four vehicles of this platoon is,\r\n  however, drawn by four horses. In addition, this platoon is equipped\r\n  with six machine gun pack saddles for transporting the guns on pack\r\n  animals. The complement consists of 1 officer, 1 first sergeant, 23\r\n  privates, 16 saddle horses, and 16 draft animals.\r\n\r\n  The machine gun platoon of a cavalry regiment consists of only\r\n  one gun, which is carried on a four-horse wagon, and a four-horse\r\n  ammunition wagon. The platoon is equipped with three pack saddles.\r\n  The complement consists of 1 officer, 1 non-commissioned officer, 13\r\n  privates, 11 saddle horses, and 8 draft horses.\r\n\r\n  The following ammunition is carried by the British machine gun\r\n  platoons:\r\n\r\n  ======================+========+==========+==========+========\r\n                        |        |  In the  |  In the  |\r\n                        |With the|ammunition| Division | Total\r\n                        | organ- |  column  |ammunition|  No.\r\n                        |ization.|  of the  |  column. |rounds.\r\n                        |        |F.

In =Japan=, soon after\r\n  the outbreak of the =Russo-Japanese war=, the Guard, the 1st, 2nd,\r\n  3rd, 4th and 6th Divisions, and the two independent cavalry brigades,\r\n  had machine gun batteries consisting of 6 guns each. During the\r\n  winter 1904-5, 320 machine guns were gradually placed in position,\r\n  singly and by platoons, in the fortifications on the Shaho.\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= At the outbreak of the =Russo-Japanese war=, a machine gun\r\n  company was assigned to the 1st, 3rd and 5th East Siberian Rifle\r\n  Brigades. This company consisted of 5 officers, 85 combatants, 13\r\n  non-combatants, 10 saddle horses, 29 draft horses, and eight guns.\r\n  The latter were mounted on high carriages, and were protected by\r\n  steel shields. Of the ammunition, 1350 rounds, in belts holding 450\r\n  rounds each, were carried on each gun carriage, and 4500 rounds\r\n  on each of the six two-wheeled ammunition carts. The field train\r\n  consisted of nine one-horse carts. The loss of the machine gun\r\n  company at the =Yalu= was probably due to the fact that the guns,\r\n  mounted on high carriages, were quickly deprived of their mobility\r\n  in their second position, after they had, from their first position,\r\n  effectively flanked the advance of the Japanese infantry. Immediately\r\n  after this first lesson, the high wheeled carriage was apparently\r\n  abolished, and the tripod adopted. On September 26th, 1904, the\r\n  machine gun companies were reorganized. There were (old) wheeled,\r\n  and (newly-organized) so-called “mountain machine gun companies,”\r\n  the latter having pack animal transportation. These companies were\r\n  assigned to infantry and Rifle divisions and were designated by the\r\n  numbers of their divisions.\r\n\r\n  On December 12th, 1906, the machine gun organization was again\r\n  changed, because it was asserted that the assignment of machine gun\r\n  companies to divisions hampered the division commander; that the\r\n  employment of 8 guns at one point was injudicious; and that so large\r\n  a machine gun battery actually induced a scattering of the guns.\r\n  Infantry, Reserve, and Rifle regiments are each assigned a machine\r\n  gun organization consisting of 4 guns, mounted on tripods, equipped\r\n  with 6 mm. steel shields, with pack animal transportation.\r\n\r\n  Complement: 3 officers, 7 non-commissioned officers, 46 privates,\r\n  7 non-combatants, 10 saddle horses, 21 pack and draft horses (8 of\r\n  these for carrying ammunition), 4 ammunition carts, and 5 train\r\n  wagons. The personnel is drawn from a regiment in which the men to be\r\n  detailed for machine gun duty are trained.\r\n\r\n  According to an officer who commanded a machine gun company in the\r\n  battle of =Liao Yang=[296], his company went into position on August\r\n  30th, on the right flank of its division behind an earth embankment\r\n  at the south edge of the village of Gutsealing, and 300 m. from the\r\n  railroad running in a southwesterly direction. This position was\r\n  taken up with the object of preventing the envelopment of the right\r\n  flank of the division. Sufficient time was available for cutting\r\n  down the kaoliang crop for 650 m. Beyond this range the kaoliang\r\n  fields continued for several hundred meters. Directly in front of\r\n  the position of the company there was a hill, upon which several\r\n  mounted men showed themselves toward 10 A. M. As soon as fire was\r\n  opened on them, they threw themselves down in a field covered\r\n  with tall kaoliang. When these mounted men had reached a fairly\r\n  open space, about 900 m. from the machine gun company, they could\r\n  be clearly seen. In rear of them was observed a mountain battery\r\n  of artillery, which endeavored to go into position on the hill\r\n  mentioned, apparently with a view of directing a flanking fire on\r\n  the Russian skirmishers farther to the front than the machine guns.\r\n  Fire was opened at once, without first bracketing the target, the\r\n  first gun firing at 1200 paces (about 850 m.), and each succeeding\r\n  gun increasing the range by 25 paces, thus covering with fire a space\r\n  150 m. deep. Immediately after fire was opened on it, the mountain\r\n  battery attempted to escape to the right, but succumbed to the fire\r\n  of the machine guns. The latter had fired about 1¹⁄₂ minutes, and had\r\n  expended 6000 rounds of ammunition. About noon, hostile (Japanese)\r\n  skirmishers attempted to cross the railroad embankment, one by one,\r\n  apparently with a view of flanking the machine guns. The latter\r\n  opened fire on the Japanese, combined sights, and, for a short\r\n  period, rapid fire with sweeping being resorted to. The movement\r\n  made by the Japanese was discontinued; an advance made by groups\r\n  against the front of the machine guns got only as far as the edge of\r\n  the cleared kaoliang field. In the open, the skirmishers were unable\r\n  to advance a single step; every attempt, on their part, to rise,\r\n  was prevented. Whether it would have been possible to advance by\r\n  crawling, while keeping up a constant fire, can, of course, not be\r\n  determined now.\r\n\r\n    [296] _Russian Invalid_, October 1904.\r\n\r\n  At nightfall the Japanese again advanced in the kaoliang field and\r\n  annoyed the machine gun company throughout the night with rifle fire.\r\n  At daybreak they were again driven back by a continued fire from\r\n  the machine guns. The Japanese skirmishers remained in readiness,\r\n  however, in the kaoliang field, and fired on any target that offered.\r\n  When their fire became more and more galling, the machine gun\r\n  commander decided to send forward a non-commissioned officer and 15\r\n  men (Reservists and horse holders, armed with rifle and bayonet) to\r\n  drive them out. The undertaking was successful. It was found that\r\n  this continuous annoying fire had been kept up by only 1 officer and\r\n  24 men.\r\n\r\n  At 3 P. M., several Japanese assembled at the railway bridge; a\r\n  signal detachment also appeared. The fire at will of the infantry,\r\n  directed on this body of men, had no effect whatever; but after\r\n  two machine guns, one using an elevation of 1025, the other one of\r\n  1075 m., had fired on that point for a short time, the Japanese\r\n  disappeared. At 5 P. M., the machine guns succeeded in repulsing an\r\n  enveloping movement made against their right flank. This movement was\r\n  betrayed only by the motion of the kaoliang stalks. Toward 7 P. M.,\r\n  the Japanese directed artillery fire upon the machine guns, which\r\n  suffered considerable losses, although the personnel was protected by\r\n  an earth parapet and had ceased to work the guns. This fire did not\r\n  cease until nightfall, and, at 9 P. M., the position was evacuated\r\n  by order. An attack made by the Japanese during the night found the\r\n  machine guns gone. During the two days of the fight the company had\r\n  lost 30% of its personnel, and had fired 26,000 rounds of ammunition,\r\n  or only about 3200 rounds per gun during two days. The superiority\r\n  of the fire of these machine guns over that of the Japanese skirmish\r\n  line can perhaps only be explained by the small numbers of the latter.\r\n\r\n  In the defensive position on the =Shaho= and at =Mukden=, machine\r\n  guns were employed in favorable positions, behind sandbag parapets\r\n  and under splinter proof roofs. According to Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n  ANISINOW, good results were obtained against skirmishers up to 1050\r\n  m., against closed bodies of infantry and against troops of cavalry\r\n  (_Eskadrons_) up to 1400 m.; against batteries of artillery, halted\r\n  in the open, staffs, and columns, the fire was sufficiently effective\r\n  up to 1960 m.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE EMPLOYMENT OF MACHINE GUN BATTERIES.\r\n\r\nMachine guns will never be able to replace artillery at long ranges; on\r\nthe other hand, they will often find an opportunity to support other\r\narms with their fire at medium and short ranges.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that machine guns do not always follow the\r\nmovements of the firing lines in action, that the commander of a\r\nforce is not always able to find a good position for them; and the\r\nquestion raised whether the space taken up by the machine guns and\r\ntheir ammunition wagons in a column could not be more profitably filled\r\nby companies of infantry or by a portion of an ammunition column of\r\ncorresponding length. To be sure, machine guns are a special arm; the\r\njustification of their existence lies in the combination of constant\r\nreadiness for firing with highly developed mobility, so that, held back\r\nunder direct control of the commander of a force, they give him the\r\nmeans wherewith to produce within a short time a sudden effect, in the\r\nnature of a surprise. This is the very purpose for which machine guns\r\nwere created. They are not intended for prolonged fire action, not for\r\naccompanying an infantry skirmish line in an advance by rushes, and,\r\nleast of all, for fighting well covered firing lines. In addition, the\r\nfact that machine guns make it possible to concentrate fire quickly on\r\nany space, whereby the moral effect is considerably increased, ought\r\nnot to be underestimated. It would seem to be advisable to employ\r\nmachine guns in conjunction with infantry when it is impossible to\r\ndevelop a powerful fire on account of the conformation of the ground,\r\nbut when such fire is desirable for commanding approaches or defiles;\r\nfurther, when fire alone suffices for delaying the enemy (for example,\r\nin rear guard actions). In this case the guns may either be pushed far\r\nto the front, or may be used in defensive positions, which can then be\r\nheld by a few men during the pauses in the fight.[297] Although machine\r\ngun fire may perhaps be relatively less accurate than that of a body of\r\ninfantry, the value of pouring a large mass of projectiles on the enemy\r\nwithin a brief space of time should not be underestimated.[298]\r\n\r\n    [297] At the Austrian Musketry School it was found that it was\r\n  not easy for a body of troops to fire on targets illuminated by the\r\n  shaft of a search light; few men possessed the requisite eyesight to\r\n  make this possible. It would no doubt be practicable, however, to\r\n  attach such men to the machine guns posted in a defensive position. A\r\n  considerable increase in fire effect could thus be obtained.\r\n\r\n    [298] Platoon volleys, directed for one minute on figures advancing\r\n  from 1200-1100 paces, resulted in 5, fire at will, in 1¹⁄₂, and\r\n  machine gun fire, in 3% hits. The three kinds of fire, when directed\r\n  against 30 prone skirmishers, resulted, in one minute, in 13, 18, and\r\n  10% hits, respectively.\r\n\r\nWhether machine guns are distributed by platoons, or are employed as\r\na unit under control of superior leaders, will depend upon whether\r\nit is contemplated to employ them in a purely defensive way for the\r\npurpose of reinforcing the several weak points, or offensively in fire\r\nsurprises or in covering the flanks. The distribution by platoons\r\nhas the undeniable disadvantage that single guns will frequently\r\nnot find an opportunity to fire; that the difficulty of ammunition\r\nsupply is increased; and that the combined employment of the several\r\nplatoons will produce friction that cannot be easily avoided. On\r\nthe other hand, in machine gun batteries of three platoons each, an\r\nemployment by platoons is easy. Although a distribution by platoons is\r\npermissible in a passive defense, the employment of the guns by battery\r\n(company) against the flanks of the attacker permits the mobility and\r\nfire power of the arm to be utilized to better advantage. While a\r\ndistribution of machine guns by platoons--if we except colonial and\r\nmountain warfare--is, indeed, cheaper, it generally leads to a useless\r\nfrittering away of fighting units.[299]\r\n\r\n    [299] Lieutenant ULRICH (retired), who participated in the fighting\r\n  in Manchuria, voices the same opinion in _Jahrbücher_, March number,\r\n  p. 285:\r\n\r\n    “The opinion has been quite prevalent that the organization of\r\n  strong machine gun units is one of the most important requirements of\r\n  modern battle.”\r\n\r\nMachine guns will be able to bring all their powers into play to the\r\nbest advantage at the beginning of a rencontre, when, from their\r\nposition as far forward as possible in the column, they are pushed to\r\nthe front to occupy important points and to compel the enemy to deploy\r\nhis infantry. The commander should, however, endeavor to withdraw the\r\nmachine guns from the fight as soon as his own infantry has deployed,\r\nin order to avoid involving the guns in a protracted fire fight\r\nnecessitating an expenditure of a great amount of ammunition and in\r\nwhich the accuracy of their fire would gradually suffer.[300] The\r\nproper sphere of machine guns lies in their employment as a separate\r\narm, whether they are posted so as to flank an enemy, or are kept\r\nat the disposal of the commander as an ever ready reserve, which\r\nis pushed forward to keep the point to be attacked under fire, to\r\nmeet a counter-attack, or--and to this use they are best adapted--to\r\nparticipate in the pursuit. Their employment is also proper in rear\r\nguard actions, since they are able to remain in position longer, for\r\nexample, than rear guard infantry, whose energies are paralyzed by the\r\nthought of getting away from the enemy in time. Machine guns are much\r\nmore independent than infantry on account of their ability to withdraw\r\nat an increased gait. On account of their greater staying power and\r\nthe greater intensity of their fire, they increase the delay which\r\nthe enemy suffers, as well as the start gained by their own force;\r\nthey moreover enable their own force to get away from the enemy and to\r\nescape pursuit.\r\n\r\n    [300] This applies particularly to machine guns which have air\r\n  cooled barrels. After four minutes of continuous fire, part of\r\n  the projectiles, and after seven minutes all of the projectiles\r\n  fired from a Hotchkiss machine gun go over the target (platoon).\r\n  _Kriegstechnische Zeitschrift_, January number, 1907.\r\n\r\nIn employing machine guns in defense, it must be borne in mind that the\r\nguns are not adapted to carry on protracted fire actions; and that the\r\nadvantage of the mobility of machine gun batteries cannot be properly\r\nutilized if they have been assigned, from the outset, a definite\r\nsection to defend. As a rule, it will be advisable, in defense, to keep\r\nthe machine guns at first with the reserve, and to employ them later,\r\nas necessity requires, even by platoons, to reinforce the defensive\r\nline at threatened points, or, by battery (company), to prevent an\r\nenvelopment, or to participate in offensive movements. This does not\r\npreclude the employment of machine guns during the preparatory stage\r\nof the engagement, for example, to command important approaches. When\r\na covered withdrawal of the guns is assured, it will also be possible\r\nto post machine gun batteries in such a manner in front of, or to a\r\nflank of the main defensive position, that they can suddenly sweep\r\nwith their fire the ground on which the opponent will probably place\r\nhis artillery. Flanking machine gun fire can sometimes be employed for\r\nsweeping dead angles.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Austrian machine gun regulations correspond in\r\nthe main to those of the German Army. In Austria special stress is\r\nlaid upon the use of machine guns with cavalry, while in Germany they\r\nare in addition a mobile reserve. Machine gun batteries accomplish the\r\nprincipal objects which cavalry expects to attain by the assignment\r\nof infantry,[301] viz., relief from fighting on foot, great fire\r\npower, and mobility. Even in reconnaissance duty, machine guns will\r\nbe employed to break down the resistance of the enemy in occupied\r\nlocalities and to augment the resistance of their own force in such\r\nplaces. During an advance, machine guns should go into position at an\r\nearly moment in order to cover as effectively as possible the approach\r\nand the deployment for attack. It is advisable to post the guns of\r\na machine gun battery together, so as not to have numerous lines of\r\nfire interfere with the movements of the cavalry; this is especially\r\nemphasized by the Austrian regulations. Machine gun batteries, like\r\nhorse batteries (artillery), remain with the cavalry divisions during a\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n    [301] In regard to the employment of machine guns in the maneuvers\r\n  of 1905, see _Streffleur_, 1906, May number.\r\n\r\nGerman machine guns are especially adapted for resisting cavalry, while\r\nguns transported upon pack animals are entirely helpless on the march\r\nand when going into position, and require the support of the other\r\narms. German machine guns, whether on their wheeled carriages or on\r\ntheir sleds, are capable of warding off cavalry. The fire of the guns\r\nshould be distributed over the entire front of the mounted attacking\r\nline. Special attention should be paid to lines following the first\r\nattacking line, to the flanks of the guns themselves, and to covering\r\nthe carriages when they are not with the guns. Machine guns are able to\r\nadvance on open ground without regard to cavalry, so long as the latter\r\nis not supported by artillery or infantry, or is not so superior in\r\nforce that it can attack simultaneously from several directions, or in\r\nseveral lines.\r\n\r\nIn action against artillery it should be borne in mind that artillery\r\npossesses an unquestioned superiority of fire at the longer ranges; at\r\nranges at which machine guns are able to fire at all, they must seek to\r\nfind protection under cover, or by distributing the guns. Artillery is\r\nvery susceptible to flanking fire. When that arm is to be engaged, the\r\nmachine gun sleds should be brought as close as possible to the hostile\r\nbatteries. In this case it is, moreover, advisable to have large\r\nintervals between the machine gun platoons. The great mobility of the\r\nmachine gun battery, when limbered, will sometimes enable it to take up\r\na position from which it can flank the enemy. In distributing machine\r\ngun fire it would be well always to assign the same task to two guns.\r\nIt is not a good plan to have all the machine guns sweep the entire\r\nfront of a firing battery (artillery).\r\n\r\n  The opinions in regard to machine gun employment in field\r\n  warfare--mountain and fortress warfare are not considered\r\n  here--differ considerably. In =England= machine guns are attached to\r\n  battalions, and Japan of late leans toward this mode of employment.\r\n  In =Switzerland= machine guns serve in addition as a substitute for\r\n  horse batteries, which their army lacks.\r\n\r\n  The =English= view is obviously affected by their experience in\r\n  colonial wars.\r\n\r\n  The following are given as the duties of machine guns _in attack_:\r\n\r\n  1. The machine gun is above all to be employed at long ranges. In\r\n  open country it will seldom be possible for the gun to reach a\r\n  position in the first line, where, moreover, the gun would offer too\r\n  good a target. Covered terrain should be taken advantage of to get\r\n  the gun close to the enemy. The advance of infantry may be supported\r\n  at long ranges by machine gun fire (fire of position).\r\n\r\n  2. The delivery of volley fire against any point of the hostile\r\n  position.\r\n\r\n  3. The warding off of counter-attacks or attacks made by cavalry.\r\n\r\n  4. The utilization of flanking positions.\r\n\r\n  5. The support of cavalry during delaying actions (ammunition being\r\n  in this case a substitute for men) although the fire effect against\r\n  low targets is very small.\r\n\r\n  6. The holding of captured positions.\r\n\r\n  _In defense_ the isolated employment of machine guns at a distance\r\n  from the organization is prohibited and their use against extended\r\n  skirmish lines cautioned against. Machine guns are well adapted for\r\n  protecting flanks and can be kept back as a reserve to prevent the\r\n  advance of hostile reinforcements, to support counter-attacks, to\r\n  direct fire against deep and dense targets, and, finally, to support\r\n  the firing line in action at short range.\r\n\r\n  _In defense_ the principal duties of machine guns will consist of--\r\n\r\n  1. Sweeping obstacles and commanding terrain which is specially\r\n  favorable for the attack; flanking of salients.\r\n\r\n  2. Reinforcing weak points.\r\n\r\n  3. Firing on advancing hostile reinforcements.\r\n\r\n  The cavalry regulations, contrary to those of the infantry, also\r\n  permit a massed employment of machine guns when ordered by brigade or\r\n  division commanders.\r\n\r\n  “As a rule, it will not be advisable to open fire on isolated mounted\r\n  men or small groups of approximately platoon strength, as this would\r\n  betray the position prematurely. In action, machine guns may be\r\n  employed in conjunction with dismounted skirmishers for the purpose\r\n  of forming a supporting point for movements, a rallying position, or\r\n  for protecting a flank. Finally, during an attack, machine guns may\r\n  support the fire of the horse battery, on the outer flank of which\r\n  they go into position, to serve as support, or to facilitate by their\r\n  fire a withdrawal.”\r\n\r\n  These official regulations are not entirely in accord with the views\r\n  entertained in the army. The combined use of the machine guns of\r\n  a brigade, such as quite naturally resulted in the engagement at\r\n  =Pieters Hill=, is advocated by many. At the longer ranges, machine\r\n  gun companies are to fire on favorable targets, discontinuing their\r\n  fire when their object has been accomplished. In addition they are to\r\n  cover the advance or withdrawal of the infantry; to fire on certain\r\n  points of the hostile position; to act against the enemy’s flanks in\r\n  pursuit; and, in defense, posted in pairs, they are to flank salient\r\n  angles and make it difficult for the enemy to approach the obstacles.\r\n\r\n  In =Switzerland= machine guns are considered an auxiliary arm. “Our\r\n  field army should be capable of accepting and sustaining battle in\r\n  the mountains and on highland plateaus without necessitating the\r\n  creation of numerous special detachments for that purpose. Machine\r\n  gun companies should be a tool which can be used in the mountains and\r\n  on highland plateaus, and which can be turned over for use to any\r\n  organization.”\r\n\r\n  The platoon is the firing unit; the company commander posts his\r\n  platoons at large intervals and regulates their mutual coöperation.\r\n  Fire, suddenly delivered from various points, frequently rather\r\n  far distant from each other, is considered to have a particularly\r\n  demoralizing effect; the scattered posting of the platoons makes it\r\n  difficult for the enemy to combat effectively the individual platoons\r\n  which are skillfully concealed on the terrain. “The indefinable,\r\n  uncanny and confusing aspect of their appearance enhances the effect\r\n  of the fire surprise.” The defensive character is here especially\r\n  clearly marked, for cavalry which counts in the first place on the\r\n  offensive will prefer a combined employment of machine guns, so as\r\n  not to be hampered in its movements by the various lines of fire. On\r\n  the march, machine guns are posted as far forward as possible in the\r\n  column; single platoons may also be attached to troops (_Eskadrons_)\r\n  of advance guard cavalry, and, in exceptional cases only, to troops\r\n  (_Eskadrons_) of reconnoitering cavalry. Machine guns, supported by\r\n  weak cavalry detachments, may be pushed forward to occupy defiles;\r\n  moreover, the machine gun company assigned to a cavalry brigade may\r\n  be sent into action either as a whole unit, or it may be divided from\r\n  the start or during the course of the fight. This machine gun company\r\n  may also be attached to regiments, troops (_Eskadrons_) or platoons\r\n  of cavalry charged with special missions, in which case it is, as a\r\n  rule, broken up into platoons. The premature detaching of machine gun\r\n  units is especially cautioned against. “The mobility of the machine\r\n  gun unit is such that it is not at all dangerous to hold them back\r\n  until the last moment before sending them to the actually threatened\r\n  point.”\r\n\r\n  The regulations deem a special support necessary for the machine\r\n  gun batteries when they are sent on independent missions. Single\r\n  guns are not to be so used. Machine guns, distributed by platoons,\r\n  invest cavalry dismounted for fire action with a special power\r\n  of resistance. It will frequently be advantageous to occupy the\r\n  enemy in front with weakly supported machine gun batteries, while\r\n  maneuvering with the main body of the mounted force so as to gain the\r\n  enemy’s weak point, and attacking him there with fire or a charge.\r\n  In a cavalry fight Maxim machine gun marksmen, by timely, hold,\r\n  and energetic action, will very often be able to create favorable\r\n  conditions for their own troops, facilitate the selection of a point\r\n  of attack, and retard and interfere with the hostile deployment.\r\n\r\n  The following statements taken from the regulations for the _Service\r\n  and Training of_ =Swiss= _cavalry_ (1904) are of interest:\r\n\r\n  “Machine guns invest pursuing cavalry with tremendous power.--Their\r\n  violent fire, suddenly breaking forth, especially when quickly\r\n  delivered at the flanks of the retreating mass, must have an\r\n  annihilating effect and convert the retreat into a rout.\r\n\r\n  “In a retreat, Maxim gun marksmen with their guns can quickly occupy\r\n  rallying positions (when possible, flanking), which, thanks to their\r\n  mobility, they are capable of holding longer than other arms. Thereby\r\n  they facilitate for the other troops the critical breaking off of the\r\n  engagement.\r\n\r\n  “The retreat will proceed with greater steadiness and time will be\r\n  gained for organizing resistance and for making that resistance more\r\n  obstinate.\r\n\r\n  “When, during the crisis of battle, every available man joins in the\r\n  fight, machine guns may take a hand in it, even when the terrain is\r\n  unfavorable for the employment of cavalry, by gaining the flanks at a\r\n  rapid gait, turning and firing upon the hostile flank or the hostile\r\n  masses launched for the counter-attack.\r\n\r\n  “It would be incorrect, however, at such a moment, simply to throw\r\n  the machine guns into the fighting line or to a flank. By doing this\r\n  the mobility of the guns would not be utilized, and they would lose\r\n  their character of a mounted arm.\r\n\r\n  “The assignment of machine guns to cavalry augments the fighting\r\n  power and independence of the latter and increases to the utmost its\r\n  desire to go ahead, its enterprise and bold initiative. With the aid\r\n  of machine guns, our militia cavalry, even when opposed by better\r\n  drilled cavalry, can go into battle calmly on our terrain, with the\r\n  firm conviction of defeating it.\r\n\r\n  “But a cavalry leader should never shrink from sacrificing his\r\n  machine guns when the object to be attained requires it, and when no\r\n  other means remain to save the force. _These weapons should never be\r\n  more to him than a welcome and powerful aid toward the fulfillment of\r\n  his mission. Cavalry which degenerates into a mere support for its\r\n  machine guns has ceased to be cavalry._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. INFANTRY VERSUS CAVALRY.[302]\r\n\r\n(Par. 451 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [302] _Taktik_, II, p. 137: _Die Attacke der Kavallerie auf\r\n  Infanterie_. For examples from military history consult the splendid\r\n  works of Major KUNZ, especially _Die deutsche Reiterei_, and\r\n  _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe individual infantryman whose rifle is loaded and who knows how to\r\nuse his bayonet is more than a match for the individual mounted man\r\neven on open ground; and, if he remains cool, retains his presence of\r\nmind, and uses his rifle properly while keeping the opponent constantly\r\nin view, he is even superior to several mounted men. Infantry which\r\nretains its steadiness has nothing to fear even when outnumbered by\r\ncavalry. Its main strength lies in steadily delivered fire, while\r\ncavalry relies on the possibility of making an unexpected rapid charge,\r\non quickly covering great distances, and on the moral effect which its\r\nirresistible onslaught undoubtedly produces upon infantry. So long as\r\nthere is a possibility of surprise and misunderstanding, of infantry\r\nallowing itself to become discouraged, and of the individual soldier\r\nbeing exposed to hunger and hardships, so long will cavalry that is\r\nenergetically led be able to gain brilliant victories. Tactics would\r\nlook differently upon the possibility of making a mounted charge\r\nduring a battle if one or two German cavalry divisions had been on\r\nthe Japanese side during the pursuit after Mukden. “If we demand of\r\ninfantry that it close with the enemy after it has suffered tremendous\r\nlosses, why should we not demand the same of cavalry whose mobility\r\nis disproportionately greater.” (_Skobeleff’s Order for the Day, June\r\n15th, 1882_). The less the world believes in a victory of cavalry, the\r\ngreater the certainty of such success. The troops should be accustomed\r\nin time of peace to the sight of charging cavalry. The recommendation\r\nmade by the late General Dragomirov of the Russian army is, at any\r\nrate, worthy of consideration.[303] He proposed that cavalry ride at\r\nfull speed through infantry lines deployed with three paces between\r\nfiles. Some infantrymen are, indeed, bound to be injured in such\r\ncharges, but the wounds produced are not likely to be serious. Infantry\r\naccustomed to such charges will not lose its steadiness so easily in\r\naction as when it comes in contact with cavalry for the first time on\r\nthe battlefield.\r\n\r\n    [303] _Vorbereitung der Truppen für den Kampf_, I, p. 55.\r\n\r\n  The success of the charge made by Captain Bechtoltsheim of the\r\n  Austrian army at =Custozza= with three platoons of Sicilian Uhlans,\r\n  may be ascribed principally to the fact that the Italian infantry\r\n  was not accustomed to field service and lacked training. This small\r\n  force of cavalry broke entirely through Pisa’s deployed Brigade\r\n  (Italian) and struck the route column of Forli’s Brigade, throwing\r\n  it into complete panic, so that of five battalions only one remained\r\n  intact. The three platoons of cavalry, which numbered about 100\r\n  sabers, lost 2 officers, 84 men, and 73 horses killed and wounded.\r\n  The charge made by three troops (_Eskadrons_) of the Dragoons of the\r\n  Guard at =Mars-la-Tour=, to facilitate the retreat of the defeated\r\n  38th Brigade, and that made by two platoons of the 7th Hussars at\r\n  =Sapignies= were likewise successful.\r\n\r\nAny formation that permits effective firing is suitable for warding off\r\ncavalry. Skirmish lines through which a cavalry charge passes suffer\r\nlosses that scarcely deserve mention. The fight is not hopeless even\r\nwhen the hostile troopers halt within the ranks of the infantry. When\r\ncavalry has charged through a skirmish line, the latter should be\r\ncareful not to face about to fire at the troopers,[304] as that would\r\ngive a second cavalry line an opportunity to approach and strike it\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\n    [304] “The French firing lines through which the cavalry had\r\n  charged (evening attack made by Rauch’s Brigade in the direction\r\n  of Rezonville on August 16th, 1870) fired after the Hussars, while\r\n  the French Infantry units in rear fired in the opposite direction.\r\n  The result was a frightful cross-fire, which, while undoubtedly\r\n  disastrous for the Hussars, certainly must have worked havoc among\r\n  the French.” KUNZ, _Reiterei_, p. 153.\r\n\r\nThe supports in rear of the first line form the objective of the\r\ncavalry after it has charged through the firing line. These supports\r\nmust therefore open fire on the cavalry regardless of the skirmishers\r\nin front.\r\n\r\nThe flanks of a firing line can be bent back only when that line is\r\nnot exposed to hostile infantry fire. The threatened wing should never\r\nbe bent forward since that interferes with the fire of adjacent units.\r\nThe task of repulsing an attack directed against a flank had best be\r\nleft to the supports in rear of the flanks. The German Cavalry Drill\r\nRegulations (par. 349) state, that toward the end of a fight the bulk\r\nof the supports and reserves will have been absorbed by the firing\r\nline; that the fire that such a line could direct toward a flank would\r\nbe insignificant; and that at any rate a _new_ firing line could not be\r\nformed within a short time; and, therefore, that a charge against its\r\nflank would be advantageous. This statement should be a warning for us\r\nalways to retain echelons or machine guns in rear of the flanks. The\r\nmost critical situation for infantry is that in which it is charged by\r\ncavalry while retiring defeated under hostile fire with no supports\r\navailable to repulse the attack. A halt means annihilation; it must be\r\nleft to each individual to save himself as best he can.\r\n\r\n  During the battle of =Scheinovo=, three companies of the 11th Russian\r\n  Rifle Regiment made an unsuccessful attack and had to retreat under\r\n  the pursuing fire of the Turks, while Turkish cavalry began to\r\n  charge their left flank. When only 200-300 m. from the Turks, the\r\n  4th Company, which was most seriously threatened, halted and formed\r\n  square as if on the parade ground. During this maneuver, all the\r\n  officers and many non-commissioned officers were either killed or\r\n  wounded. The heavy losses of the battalion (50%) may, in the main, be\r\n  ascribed to this halt under the most violent fire of the enemy.[305]\r\n\r\n    [305] KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den\r\n  Russisch-Türkischen Krieg_, I, p. 166.\r\n\r\nWhen the cavalry charge comes more from the front, however, the hostile\r\ninfantry and artillery will have to stop firing, and it may then be\r\npossible to rally or re-form the defeated force, provided the men will\r\nheed their leaders.\r\n\r\nUnits in close order can deploy quickly toward the front or flank for\r\nthe purpose of firing. However, they will be able to fire in close\r\norder only when not themselves subjected to hostile fire. The front and\r\nflanks of a body of infantry in proper formation are equally strong,\r\nbut, in this connection, it should be borne in mind that a deployment\r\ntoward a flank, for the purpose of firing, always takes time and is apt\r\nto impair the steadiness of the men.[306]\r\n\r\n    [306] General VON SCHERFF (_Kriegslehren_, II, p. 263) believes\r\n  that a frontal charge made by cavalry of sufficient strength has\r\n  better chances of succeeding than a charge in deep formation against\r\n  a flank. In a frontal charge, the suddenly appearing cavalry is\r\n  exposed “only to the fire at will of individual skirmishers whose\r\n  continuous front masks the fire of units in rear.” In the other case\r\n  (charge against a flank) the cavalry receives not only the fire of\r\n  the closed bodies first encountered, but also that of the supports\r\n  firing through the gaps between these groups. The frontal attacks\r\n  executed with superb gallantry by the French cavalry at Sedan rather\r\n  prove the opposite.\r\n\r\nIf time admits, a position may be looked for near obstacles, such as\r\nditches, hedges, swampy ground, etc., which impede the hostile cavalry.\r\nIt is not necessary, however, for the infantry to occupy the obstacle\r\nitself; in fact, it is better to take up a position some distance\r\naway. The shortness of our rifles obliges us to form the firing unit\r\nat right angles to the line of advance of the approaching cavalry,\r\nand to avoid aiming obliquely. The provision contained in a number of\r\ndrill regulations, including the French, that the bodies in close order\r\n(supports, reserves) should be formed in echelon, is objectionable,\r\nas this is apt to lead to their firing on one another (as the French\r\ninfantry did in repulsing the charge made by Bredow’s Brigade and\r\nthe Dragoons of the Guard at Vionville). The deployment from “broad”\r\nand “deep” column to meet a sudden cavalry charge can, as a rule, be\r\nordered directly by company commanders on the caution of the battalion\r\ncommander, the method of meeting the attack being promptly decided\r\nupon. The main thing is to be in instant readiness for firing and to\r\nprotect the flanks by means of echelons.\r\n\r\n  In a deployment from “deep column,” the measures taken by the\r\n  commanders of the rear companies must conform to those of the leading\r\n  companies. To meet a cavalry charge coming from the right front, for\r\n  example, the following scheme would be appropriate:\r\n\r\n  _The 1st Company_ forms left front into line so that its front is at\r\n  right angles to the line of advance of the cavalry;\r\n\r\n  _The 2nd Company_ forms as a support in rear of the left flank of the\r\n  first company;\r\n\r\n  _The 3rd Company_ forms right front into line, and prolongs the line\r\n  of the first company;\r\n\r\n  _The 4th Company_ also forms right front into line, or is held in\r\n  readiness as a support in rear of the right flank. In this way the\r\n  approaching cavalry can be met by the fire of from six to eight\r\n  platoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is a very simple matter to ward off a cavalry charge directed\r\nagainst the flank of a marching column (form line by wheeling by\r\nsquads). When the cavalry charge is directed against the head or\r\nthe tail of a column, as recommended by the German Cavalry Drill\r\nRegulations (par. 350), there will not be time enough, as a rule, for\r\nthe entire company or battalion to form line. It will suffice to let\r\nthe leading elements form line, the rear elements moving out of the\r\ncolumn and forming in rear of the flanks as supports.\r\n\r\nSuccessful resistance does not depend upon the formation taken up; in\r\nfact the latter is of importance only when it increases the feeling of\r\nsecurity. The morale of an organization is of more importance than the\r\nformation taken up. A proud confidence in victory and morale are the\r\nonly factors which decide success, and the training of infantry should\r\nbe such as to develop these qualities.\r\n\r\nCavalry will in many cases consider that it has gained a success if it\r\ncauses infantry to discontinue a movement, or to take up formations\r\nwhich interfere with the highest development of its fire, or which\r\noffer favorable targets to the hostile infantry and artillery. This\r\nis especially the case where infantry is in the act of beginning an\r\nassault, when the slightest hesitation may jeopardize success. If\r\ncavalry actually begins to charge at this moment, only the bodies\r\nimmediately threatened halt at the signal “attention,”[307] and face\r\nthe cavalry; the remainder continue the march.\r\n\r\n    [307] The German army is the only one that employs an appropriate\r\n  signal for this purpose. The attack made by the 28th Infantry Brigade\r\n  against the wood of Bor at Königgrätz is very instructive in this\r\n  connection. HÖNIG, _Taktik der Zukunft_, p. 56. At the signal,\r\n  “cavalry,” the threatened portions of the brigade halted and formed\r\n  square. Fortunately the Saxons had already begun to retire from the\r\n  edge of the wood. A stray hostile troop (_Eskadron_) had caused all\r\n  the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe sudden appearance of a line of charging cavalry produces such a\r\ntremendous psychological effect on troops not immediately threatened,\r\nthat they either watch the attack passively, or else too many of them\r\ntake a hand in repulsing it. This moment, in which the attention of\r\nthe troops is so completely riveted on the cavalry, is seldom utilized\r\nfor the purpose of gaining ground to the front, or for effecting a\r\nwithdrawal.[308] It needs but little imagination to picture to one’s\r\nself the success which the French army could have gained at Waterloo if\r\ninfantry masses had followed on the heels of Ney’s cavalry squadrons.\r\nIn the battle of Vionville the German infantry fired at the most\r\nincredible angles at the charging French Guard cavalry. While Bredow’s\r\nBrigade was making its charge during the same battle, part of the\r\ninfantry of the 6th Division stopped firing on the French skirmishers,\r\nto follow with intense interest the cavalry charge that was taking\r\nplace on a totally different part of the battlefield. This conduct,\r\nas natural as incorrect, suggests the advisability of profiting by\r\nsuch moments of the enemy’s inattention for the purpose of executing\r\na movement or holding him with our own fire. It also seems absolutely\r\nnecessary to support with rifle fire the charge made by one’s own\r\ncavalry, or at any rate to prevent the hostile infantry from firing\r\nundisturbed on our troopers.\r\n\r\n    [308] “Every leader should carefully watch the progress of a\r\n  cavalry charge, and, as soon as he observes that friendly cavalry has\r\n  succeeded in penetrating the hostile line or that the enemy is shaken\r\n  and directs all of his fire against the charging cavalry, he should\r\n  immediately advance to the attack and be upon the enemy with the\r\n  bayonet before the latter recovers his senses. Such an attack will\r\n  not have been made in vain, even if the cavalry has been repulsed.”\r\n  General GURKO’S comments on the maneuvers of 1893.\r\n\r\n    Prince FREDERICK CHARLES, in his _Winke für die Offiziere der unter\r\n  Meinen Befehlen ins Feld rückenden Truppen_ (1870), also demands that\r\n  the infantry should quickly follow up cavalry attacks.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons, however, why a sharp lookout should be\r\nkept during a hostile cavalry charge. All cavalry drill regulations\r\nrecognize that a charge has greater chances of succeeding when it is\r\nmade in deep formation, in successive lines, or simultaneously from\r\nseveral directions. The fire of the infantry is distributed, and,\r\nunless a good lookout is kept, a part of the cavalry, scarcely or not\r\nat all molested by fire, may perhaps succeed in driving the attack\r\nhome. This will be the case when infantry allows itself to be enticed\r\ninto developing a heavy fire in a direction from which only a feint is\r\nmade, while the main attack comes from another, or from several other\r\ndirections. Well led infantry will, therefore, never employ more rifles\r\nin repulsing cavalry than are absolutely necessary, while the mere\r\nthreat of a cavalry charge will induce badly led infantry to develop an\r\nexcessive volume of fire.\r\n\r\nOn open terrain, when the approaching cavalry is visible at a\r\nconsiderable distance, and when the infantry itself is exposed to\r\neffective fire, the prone aiming position is to be preferred. The men\r\nlying flat on the ground are not so easily wounded by the hostile\r\ntroopers, and the horses will generally avoid stepping on them, besides\r\nwhich, the danger space is greater than when the men fire standing. In\r\nrolling or close country, where cavalry cannot be seen by men lying\r\ndown, the aiming position kneeling or standing should properly be\r\nassumed. The losses inflicted by hostile fire must then be endured.\r\nHorses and riders are more apt to lose dash when charging an upright\r\nhuman wall that is spouting fire, than when charging a kneeling or\r\nprone opponent who scarcely offers an obstacle to the charge. What is\r\nof greater importance, however, is that men standing upright can more\r\neasily execute a change of front, fire on passing cavalry, and use\r\ntheir bayonets in case the cavalry actually penetrates their line. The\r\nBritish and Italian regulations very properly prescribe that the front\r\nrank of a body of infantry in close order should kneel in such cases.\r\n\r\nAs the success of infantry depends to a great extent upon the\r\nsteadiness with which it receives the cavalry, it would seem to be\r\nadvantageous to withhold the fire until the cavalry gets within short\r\nrange.[309] General Dragomirov says in his forcible manner, “It is\r\nnot the bullet which has been fired, but the bullet which is still in\r\nthe rifle-barrel, and reserved for short range, that harms charging\r\ncavalry.” If infantry in line was able to repulse a cavalry charge\r\nin the past at 40 paces, with smoothbore muskets and at the first\r\nvolley,[310] the chances of doing this with modern rifles would be\r\nstill greater, if the “stopping power” of the 8 mm. projectiles were\r\nabsolutely certain at short ranges. As this is not the case, it is\r\nnecessary to open fire at an earlier moment.[311] If infantry does\r\nnot fire until cavalry gets within very short range, it will have to\r\nreckon with the fact that even wounded horses will still be able to\r\ncarry their riders into its ranks. However, for purposes of instruction\r\nin time of peace, it is proper to open fire late. If an infantry unit\r\nis trained in time of peace always to open fire at the medium ranges on\r\ncharging cavalry, the unexpected appearance of hostile cavalry at short\r\nranges in actual war, is more likely to bring disorder into the ranks\r\nof such a unit, than if it is trained in time of peace to reserve its\r\nfire until the cavalry has come within short range.\r\n\r\n    [309] “The best preparation against rapidly executed mounted\r\n  charges is for all commanders to keep their eyes open, quickly and\r\n  coolly to size up the situation, and to act with determination. All\r\n  precipitation or haste would be disastrous, for it would communicate\r\n  itself to the troops. Infantry has never yet fired too late upon\r\n  cavalry.” Feldzeugmeister V. WÄLDSTATTEN.\r\n\r\n    [310] At Sedan, the 5th Company of the 46th Infantry fired only at\r\n  140 and 80 paces, and repulsed the charge. _Geschichte des Regiments\r\n  Nr. 46_, p. 186. In the same battle the 9th and 12th Companies of the\r\n  87th Infantry repulsed a charge at 60 paces. _Gen. St. W._, II, p.\r\n  1217.\r\n\r\n    [311] The _France Militaire_ contains the following statement\r\n  in regard to the effect produced on horses by bullets from the\r\n  French Lebel rifle in the engagements near Casablanca in 1907:\r\n  “Many officers serving in the field observed that the small caliber\r\n  bullets stopped horses only when a foot had been shattered or when\r\n  a vital organ had been hit. _At Casablanca, horses that had been\r\n  hit by several bullets continued to gallop for a long while._ This\r\n  is a remarkable phenomenon, for the gentlemen of theory count as\r\n  out of action every horse that has been hit by a projectile. This\r\n  is entirely incorrect. _Many wounded horses carry their riders into\r\n  the melée and do not die until the day after the fight._ This was\r\n  observed on the French as well as on the Moroccan side.\r\n\r\n    “Troopers charging full tilt, with the firm determination of\r\n  penetrating the hostile line, are not stopped so easily. In the first\r\n  place, they would have to be hit, and that, in itself, is not such\r\n  an easy matter. This is still more difficult for the infantry, if it\r\n  knows the dash of the hostile troopers. Let us cultivate the dash of\r\n  our cavalrymen, even if unreal situations are thereby produced in our\r\n  peace exercises. If, on the other hand, we teach our troopers in time\r\n  of peace to turn tail in the face of imaginary projectiles, we are\r\n  training our cavalry for panic in time of war.”\r\n\r\n  At =Garcia Hernandez= (1812), a French square was broken by a\r\n  wounded horse falling down within the ranks of the infantry. This\r\n  is, however, only true of closed bodies of infantry formed in two\r\n  ranks. Horses will frequently break through a skirmish line--whether\r\n  or not the horses are wounded is immaterial. Men are wounded in such\r\n  an event in exceptional cases only, and the wounds produced are\r\n  generally insignificant.\r\n\r\n  The following episode shows the effect produced on cavalry when it\r\n  attacks unshaken infantry which is in good formation and reserves its\r\n  fire. During the retreat after the battle of =Jena=, on October 28th,\r\n  1806, the Grenadier Battalion _Prinz August_, threatened by hostile\r\n  cavalry, did not feel equal to continue its march to Prenzlau and\r\n  attempted to cross the Ucker farther down. In the expectation that\r\n  a cavalry charge would be made, square was formed and the officers\r\n  were told not to fire until the cavalry had approached to within 20\r\n  paces. “Meantime, the French cavalry--the brigade which had crossed\r\n  at Golmitz as well as the remainder of Beaumont’s Division, under\r\n  its commander, in all nine regiments--approached. The first charge\r\n  was made by nine troops (_Eskadrons_) under the division commander.\r\n  They approached at a gallop. When the expected fire did not come, the\r\n  dragoons gradually reined in their horses, so that finally they were\r\n  going no faster than a slow trot. At 30 paces the command “Fire” was\r\n  given in the infantry and quite a number of troopers fell, the rest\r\n  galloping by the square on both sides. Eight subsequent charges were\r\n  repulsed in a similar manner.”[312]\r\n\r\n    [312] VON LETTOW-VORBECK, _Der Krieg von 1806-7_, II, p. 279. The\r\n  charge of the 5th Lancers at Beaumont forms a counterpart of the\r\n  above. KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 5, p. 18.\r\n\r\nWe have moreover to consider, in this connection, the strength of the\r\ninfantry, the formation of the cavalry, and whether the latter charges\r\nfrom several directions or in several successive lines. A small force\r\nof infantry, especially when it may anticipate attacks from several\r\ndirections, must open fire sooner than a strong infantry force which\r\nhas to contend with an attack coming from one direction only. In the\r\nfirst mentioned case, an attempt must be made to meet quickly, one by\r\none, the attacks which follow each other at intervals.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a different matter when the infantry itself is not directly\r\nthreatened, but can take a hand in repulsing a cavalry charge made on\r\nanother unit; then it is advisable to open fire at an early moment\r\nin order to break the momentum of the charge at long range. (11th\r\nJäger-Battalion at Wörth; 8th Company of the 46th Infantry at Sedan).\r\n\r\nThis in part determines the rear sight elevation that should be used.\r\nThe sights should not be changed on the battlefield, although this\r\nhas been done on the drill ground by well trained soldiers without\r\nimpairing the continuity or accuracy of the fire. According to the\r\ntable of ordinates of the trajectory (par. 23 German I. F. R.), a\r\nbullet fired when the sight is set at 700 m. and aim is taken at the\r\nfeet of the horse, does not rise above the height of a mounted trooper\r\nthroughout that entire distance. The bullets may pass entirely over the\r\ntarget however, when the men take too full a sight in the excitement\r\nof battle, or when, in rolling country or terrain covered with grass\r\nor crops, they cannot see the bottom of the target and aim above that\r\nline. It is better, therefore, to aim at the breast of the horse, with\r\nsights set at 600 m., and to fire as soon as the target gets within 800\r\nm. On account of the excitement attending every cavalry charge, it is\r\nnot advisable to change sights.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to fire one volley first and then to employ fire at\r\nwill. It is not easy for infantry, while awaiting the onrushing mass\r\nof cavalry, to reserve its fire until, in the opinion of the leader,\r\nthe first shot may be fired. But this waiting is of great importance\r\nto prevent the fire from becoming wild and ineffective. Since the\r\nelimination of powder smoke, there is no reason why other volleys\r\nshould be fired after the first, for in the excitement of the fight\r\nthe volley cannot produce a moral effect. The horses certainly find\r\nthe rattling of fire at will more unpleasant than the sudden crack of\r\na volley. The advantage of the volley, of permitting a unit to be kept\r\nbetter in hand, may be an important factor under certain circumstances\r\nhowever. The volley should, as a rule, be used by supports that are not\r\nexposed to fire. (8th Company of the 32nd Infantry at Wörth; the 1st\r\nand 2nd Companies of the 83rd Infantry, and the 5th Company of Jägers\r\nat Sedan).\r\n\r\nSince the principal object of the fire is to destroy the cohesion\r\nof the charge, and as cavalry always closes toward the center while\r\ncharging, no special importance need be attached to the distribution of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nAs regards relative numerical strength, a platoon of infantry\r\nconsisting of 60 rifles (firing 360-500 rounds per minute), should be\r\na match for 1-3 troops (_Eskadrons_), and a company of infantry, under\r\nfavorable conditions, may be able to deal with a cavalry brigade.[313]\r\nCavalry can become dangerous for infantry only when the infantry is\r\nsurprised, finds no opportunity to fire, loses its steadiness and\r\nmorale, or attempts to reach cover by running.\r\n\r\n    [313] A German cavalry brigade consists of eight troops\r\n  (_Eskadrons_). _Translator_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Charge of the French Cuirassiers of the Guard at Vionville.\r\n\r\n  At half past 12 on the afternoon of August 16th, 1870, the companies\r\n  of the 10th Prussian Infantry Brigade were advancing east of Flavigny\r\n  towards the Metz--Mars-la-Tour _chaussee_. As French infantry was\r\n  not on the spot to put a stop to this movement, the 3rd Lancers and\r\n  the Guard Cuirassier Regiment received orders to attack. The former\r\n  regiment went to the rear, as no definite objective (?) had been\r\n  assigned to it.\r\n\r\n  The Guard Cuirassier Regiment was formed in two lines, 150 m.\r\n  distance between them, with two troops (_Eskadrons_) in each line, a\r\n  fifth troop (_Eskadron_) following as a reserve. Although hampered\r\n  in its movements and thrown into disorder by abandoned baggage\r\n  wagons and other camp litter that covered the ground, the regiment\r\n  nevertheless made the charge with superb gallantry.\r\n\r\n  The charge struck the 6th and 7th Companies of the 52nd Infantry,\r\n  under Captain Hildebrand. These companies, rifles in hand and their\r\n  leader in front, awaited the French cavalry, which came into view\r\n  at a distance of 1200 m. The first echelon (6th and 4th Troops) was\r\n  received with rapid fire at 250 paces. On the right, the 6th Troop\r\n  (_Eskadron_) approached to within 60-80 paces of the Prussians,\r\n  but a part then turned to the rear while a few troopers turned to\r\n  the left. It is said, that of the leaders only one officer and one\r\n  non-commissioned officer remained in the saddle, and that only\r\n  twenty cuirassiers were rallied after the charge. The left troop\r\n  (_Eskadron_) missed its objective completely. The Prussian rear rank\r\n  faced about and fired on some French troopers who attempted to make\r\n  an attack from the rear and who now also received fire from other\r\n  units of Prussian infantry.\r\n\r\n  During the charge, the distance between the first and second lines\r\n  had become greater than at first ordered. When the first line broke\r\n  in two, the second was still some 300 m. distant from the Prussian\r\n  infantry and suffered some losses, probably from stray shots, which\r\n  did not stop the movement however, as the fire soon ceased. German\r\n  accounts, to be sure, do not mention that the second line could\r\n  not be seen on account of the powder smoke, and that the fire was\r\n  discontinued to let the smoke clear away. When the French line was\r\n  100 m. away it received the command _chargez_ and the Prussian\r\n  infantry again resumed its rapid fire, which shattered the attack,\r\n  the leading troopers breaking down in a ditch about 10 paces in\r\n  front of the Prussian line. The third line, its cohesion impaired\r\n  and its advance hampered by fallen horses and riders, was just as\r\n  little able to reach the Prussian companies. The right wing of the\r\n  Cuirassiers raced around the left flank of the companies of the 52nd\r\n  Infantry and encountered the Füsilier Battalion of the 12th Infantry,\r\n  deployed in a single firing line, dense in the center. Some parts\r\n  of this battalion formed squares. The charge was definitely stopped\r\n  by the fire of this battalion. An attempt to rally the Cuirassiers\r\n  was prevented by Prussian cavalry which now moved out. The French\r\n  regiment, which had begun its attack with 575 sabers, had lost 22\r\n  officers, 208 men (36.2% of its strength), and 243 horses. According\r\n  to Dick de Lonlay,[314] after this charge, the regiment was able to\r\n  form only 4 troops (_Eskadrons_) of 62 troopers each, instead of 5\r\n  troops (_Eskadrons_) of 115 troopers each, which would mean a loss\r\n  of 248 men. The first line had suffered the heaviest losses; in\r\n  the 4th troop (_Eskadron_), which had lost all of its officers and\r\n  non-commissioned officers, only 18 men were left.\r\n\r\n    [314] _Français et Allemands_, III, p. 84. KUNZ,\r\n  _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 5, p. 11. The French _Gen. St. W._,\r\n  II, pp. 301-309, gives the losses as 18 officers, 170 men, and 208\r\n  horses.\r\n\r\nA charge has a better chance of succeeding if it is prepared by\r\nartillery fire.\r\n\r\n  During the attack made by two troops (_Eskadrons_) of Landwehr\r\n  Hussars against the 1st Battalion _Gyulai_ at =Tobitschau=, an\r\n  Austrian square was broken by shells before the cavalry penetrated\r\n  it. During the attack of Bredow’s Brigade at =Vionville=, the\r\n  artillery was able to send its last shells against the enemy\r\n  immediately past the right flank of the cavalry brigade.\r\n\r\nThe employment of cavalry in masses, contemplated in all armies,\r\ncompels us to consider the case when infantry must advance over open\r\nground in the face of hostile cavalry. Special units must then be\r\ndesignated, who, by means of long range fire, repulse the cavalry or\r\nkeep it at a distance. At Minden (1759), Anglo-Hanoverian infantry\r\nsucceeded in driving the hostile cavalry from the field, and at\r\nVauxchamps and Etoges (14th February, 1814), Prussian infantry\r\nsucceeded in breaking through the French cavalry. It will be easy to\r\ndo the same thing with modern weapons, so long as cavalry is not very\r\nsuperior in numbers, and is not supported by infantry, machine guns, or\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nInfantry attacking dismounted cavalry should endeavor to bring long\r\nrange fire to bear on the led horses or threaten them by a flank\r\nattack. For infantry to prolong the action at long and medium ranges\r\nis only playing into the hands of the cavalry, and besides, the better\r\nmarksmanship of the infantry is bound to make itself felt at short\r\nranges. When the infantry has once gotten to within 700 paces (560 m.)\r\nof the dismounted cavalry, it is very doubtful whether the latter will\r\nstill be able to mount; at the very least, it will be difficult for it\r\nto do so (par. 362 German C. D. R.), even though the withdrawal can be\r\neffected under cover, or when fresh troops take a hand in the fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisions of Various Regulations.\r\n\r\n  =England.= The possibility of a successful cavalry charge is almost\r\n  universally contested. When necessary, the skirmishers that are\r\n  immediately threatened close in toward the center. Bayonets are to be\r\n  fixed. An opportunity for successful employment of cavalry is offered\r\n  when infantry has fired away all of its ammunition; when it is forced\r\n  to retire; and when the approach of the cavalry is facilitated by\r\n  dust, fog, or heavy rain.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= _Brave and steady infantry has nothing to fear from\r\n  cavalry charges, so long as it retains its steadiness, presence of\r\n  mind, and morale, and delivers its fire steadily and with good aim at\r\n  short range._\r\n\r\n  When fighting cavalry, movements and changes of formation should be\r\n  ordered only when sufficient time is available, and then only for the\r\n  purpose of bringing a sufficient number of rifles into action and\r\n  for better utilizing the terrain. When a cavalry charge is suddenly\r\n  made from a short distance, it is better to remain in a narrow\r\n  formation than to deploy hastily, provided the fire is delivered with\r\n  steadiness. As cavalry frequently attacks only for the purpose of\r\n  forcing the infantry to discontinue its advance, or to induce it to\r\n  take up a close order formation, all units not immediately threatened\r\n  by the attack should continue their movement or remain in their\r\n  positions.\r\n\r\n  When a force has to cover long stretches under conditions which make\r\n  it probable that a cavalry attack will be made, the battalions,\r\n  companies, or platoons should be so grouped that they can quickly\r\n  meet the cavalry attack in any direction, and can mutually support\r\n  each other in warding it off. Staffs and vehicles should place\r\n  themselves within the protected area thus formed.\r\n\r\n  The threatened units turn in the appropriate direction, properly\r\n  utilizing cover and obstacles while so doing, and, when necessary,\r\n  fix bayonets. Only such a part of the force is designated to fire as\r\n  seems necessary for warding off the attack; the other parts continue\r\n  to carry out the task assigned them. The commander retains a part of\r\n  his force in readiness for warding off unexpected attacks.\r\n\r\n  “When exposed to hostile fire while warding off a cavalry charge, the\r\n  men should assume the position offering the smallest target.\r\n\r\n  “If a platoon is _directly attacked_ by cavalry, it will only in rare\r\n  cases be advisable to open fire at ranges beyond 600 paces (450 m.);\r\n  _frequently it will be a good plan, however, to let the cavalry come\r\n  up close_. When the platoon participates in warding off a cavalry\r\n  attack made against another unit, it may open fire at longer ranges.\r\n\r\n  “Fire at will is the principal kind of fire to be used in warding off\r\n  cavalry.”\r\n\r\n  =France.= Infantry, no matter in what formation it may happen to be,\r\n  has nothing to fear from hostile cavalry, even if the latter is in\r\n  superior numbers, provided the infantry remains cool, well in hand,\r\n  and makes good use of its fire.\r\n\r\n  When cavalry surprises infantry, the effect is as great as of old.\r\n  Infantry should therefore carefully protect itself in all situations\r\n  of combat, especially during critical moments.\r\n\r\n  If cavalry is reported, infantry can guard against all contingencies\r\n  by echeloning. It should not allow itself to be diverted from its\r\n  task so long as the cavalry does not begin an attack.\r\n\r\n  Any disposition that enables infantry to change front quickly to meet\r\n  a charge, and to deliver a strong fire, is calculated to stop even\r\n  the boldest cavalry.\r\n\r\n  When fighting dismounted cavalry, it is considered desirable for\r\n  the infantry to advance quickly to medium and short ranges for the\r\n  purpose of firing upon the cavalry as it mounts.\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= Nothing prescribed.\r\n\r\n  =Japan.= Infantry which, while engaged with the enemy, is forced to\r\n  discontinue its movement or to change its formation for the purpose\r\n  of warding off hostile cavalry, has already suffered a partial\r\n  defeat. Only those fractions that are absolutely necessary for\r\n  repulsing the cavalry should take up the fight against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. INFANTRY VERSUS ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE PASSAGE OF INFANTRY THROUGH ARTILLERY LINES.\r\n\r\nThe artillery of a mobilized German army corps with its twenty-four\r\nbatteries takes up approximately 2500 m. of the front of about 4000\r\nm. available for the corps. When the ground is unfavorable, the front\r\navailable for the other arms may be still further reduced. All remedies\r\nsuggested for reducing the frontage required by artillery offer no real\r\nsolution of the difficulty; in fact, they have resulting drawbacks,\r\nsuch as the reduction to ten paces of the interval between guns, and\r\nthe posting of artillery in two lines, one in rear of the other. On\r\naccount of these drawbacks, a commander will avail himself of these\r\nremedies only in case of the most urgent necessity. The question as\r\nto how infantry can best pass through these long artillery lines is\r\ntherefore of especial interest. While artillery will generally seek\r\ncommanding positions and avoid covered terrain, infantry will make use\r\nof depressions and cover as the natural routes of advance for passing\r\nby batteries in action and for deploying subsequently in front of them.\r\nIn this case the solution of the problem is simple. The difficulties\r\nare disproportionately greater when terrain impassable for artillery\r\nis lacking. Nothing could be more desirable for hostile artillery\r\nwhich has adjusted its fire upon our batteries, than for the intervals\r\nbetween our guns to become suddenly filled with infantry, whereupon\r\nour artillery, until now under fire, would have to cease firing so\r\nas not to endanger our infantry. This pause in the fire will be more\r\nnoticeable, when our artillery has not yet succeeded in gaining a\r\nsuperiority of fire over the hostile guns; and its length will depend\r\nupon the depth of the infantry formation. In this case the infantry\r\ncannot avoid heavy losses as it must cross the fire-swept space in rear\r\nof the guns, and soon thereafter must enter the zone of the opponent’s\r\nactual “fire for effect,” besides losing for the time being the support\r\nof its own artillery fire. It is obvious that for infantry to advance\r\nin deployed lines through artillery in action, condemns the latter\r\nto long silence, and even exposes it to the danger of being placed\r\naltogether out of action. Infantry can pass through artillery lines at\r\ncertain points only, its passage being subject to an agreement between\r\nthe infantry and artillery commanders. It is advisable to have those\r\nbatteries cease firing whose fire has the least influence on the course\r\nof the artillery combat. It is, however, of the utmost importance\r\nthat the fire of all hostile batteries which possibly could fire on\r\nour infantry, be kept down by the increased fire of our artillery. In\r\nthis manner, we may perhaps be able to draw the fire of the hostile\r\nartillery away from those points at which our infantry is to pass\r\nthrough our artillery line. This is especially important. It will also\r\nbe advantageous to designate successively, different points in the\r\nartillery line for the passage of infantry. This should be done for two\r\nreasons: first, in order that a favorable target whose re-appearance\r\nthe hostile batteries could await with loaded guns, may not be\r\npresented to the enemy at one point for a prolonged period; second,\r\nin order that movements by the flank on the part of the infantry may\r\nbe obviated. The column of squads would be a suitable formation in\r\nwhich two battalions of infantry could simultaneously pass through the\r\nline of guns approximately within the space occupied by one battery.\r\nThese battalions should then at once deploy, executing front into line\r\ntoward their respective outer flanks. The guns can resume firing only\r\nwhen their infantry has reached a point 3-400 m. in front of them. The\r\nartillery will be able to resume its fire earlier when it is posted in\r\nrear of a crest, and for this reason such points should be selected for\r\nthe passage of infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE ADVANCE UNDER ARTILLERY FIRE.[315]\r\n\r\n    [315] A lecture delivered by Major C. E. D. BUDWORTH, R.A., at\r\n  the Royal Artillery Institution, on December 3, 1908, entitled,\r\n  _Infantry Formations in the Attack: from an Artilleryman’s Point of\r\n  View_, contains some interesting information. The lecture mentioned\r\n  appeared in _The Journal of the Royal Artillery_ for February, 1909.\r\n  _Translator_.\r\n\r\nIn almost every attack, infantry will be obliged to advance for\r\nconsiderable distances under artillery fire without being able to\r\ntake advantage of cover. It should guard against being surprised by\r\nartillery fire while in an unsuitable formation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, everything that facilitates the enemy’s adjustment\r\nand observation of fire should be avoided. (See p. 119 supra). To this\r\nend, infantry should not remain unnecessarily long near objects that\r\nare clearly visible at a great distance. If it is noticed that the\r\nenemy is beginning to adjust his fire on some prominent feature of\r\nthe terrain, that point should be passed as quickly as possible; the\r\nsame is true of a plain in the enemy’s zone of fire. Narrow columns,\r\nseparated by intervals of 50 m., their heads not on the same line, are\r\nadvantageous. This formation prevents shrapnel from simultaneously\r\nstriking two columns, and makes it difficult for the enemy to judge\r\nthe relative position of the smoke from the burst of his shrapnel with\r\nrespect to the target. This increases the difficulties of the enemy’s\r\nobservation of fire, as it is not easy for him to determine whether his\r\nshots go over or fall short. A shallow echelon formation (about 50 m.\r\ndeep, as used in Russia, for example) is valueless for reducing losses,\r\nowing to the depth of the beaten zone of modern projectiles.\r\n\r\nThe narrowest possible front should be presented to the enemy when\r\nwithin his zone of fire.\r\n\r\nIt is moreover desirable to make the further observation of fire\r\ndifficult for the hostile artillery, and to diminish the effect of his\r\nprojectiles at the target (see p. 120 supra) by taking up suitable\r\nformations. Broad, shallow formations were suitable against the shell\r\nfire of the past. However, they had the great drawback of considerably\r\nfacilitating the observation of shots falling short or going over, as\r\nthe smoke from the burst hid the target in the first case, and as\r\nthe target appeared silhouetted against the smoke from the burst in\r\nthe second. The cone of dispersion of the modern base charge shrapnel\r\ncombines comparatively small lateral spread with great effect in depth.\r\nThe effect of a well-placed shrapnel may be confined to one target, and\r\nthat of projectiles bursting in the intervals reduced by taking up a\r\nformation in which narrow columns (columns of squads) are separated by\r\nwide intervals (up to 50 m.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe range is determined or verified by bracketing; that is, by\r\nenclosing the target between shots which, fired at a known difference\r\nof range, strike respectively, short of and beyond the target. In\r\nFrance this is done either by battery salvo or by piece. In the former\r\ncase, the French distribute the fire equally over the entire space\r\nwhich they wish to cover with fire; hence, they do not direct it upon\r\nthe individual columns, especially when they employ indirect laying,\r\ntheir favorite mode of procedure. It is in this kind of fire especially\r\nthat narrow columns, separated by wide intervals, are a great\r\nadvantage, because it is pure accident if a projectile falls so that\r\nits burst can be observed. Moreover, when the columns are not abreast\r\nof each other, the observations of bursts may be contradictory. Thus,\r\nin one salvo, “over” and “short” bursts may be obtained, especially\r\nif several bursts could not be reliably observed, and the salvo will\r\nhave to be repeated. When a projectile bursts “short,” immediately\r\nin front of the 1st company, for example, it may be assumed that the\r\nnext projectile will be fired at a range increased by 100-200 m. The\r\n1st company should therefore move to the front at double time, the 2nd\r\nand 3rd likewise, while the 4th executes platoons front into line and\r\ntakes to cover in anticipation of an “over” shot. The “over” meant\r\nfor the 1st company will then be the signal for the 4th company to\r\nrush forward. _The following general rule may be given: A projectile\r\nbursting “over” or just “short” of the target requires that the force\r\nfired upon move quickly; a projectile bursting far “short” of the\r\ntarget requires that cover be taken._ The platoon and squad leaders of\r\nthe attacking force should not betray its presence by standing upright;\r\nthe force should disappear absolutely without leaving a trace.\r\n\r\nA force cannot, in the long run, prevent artillery from effecting an\r\nadjustment of fire upon it; all it can do is to postpone the beginning\r\nof the fire for effect.\r\n\r\nFire for effect is of three kinds:\r\n\r\n1. “Progressive fire” (_tir progressif_).[316] In this fire, after\r\nestablishing a bracket (as a rule, one of 200 m.), every piece fires\r\ntwo rounds at each of four ranges, viz., at a range 100 m. less than\r\nthe short limit of the bracket, at both ranges of the bracket, and at a\r\nrange 100 m. greater than the long limit of the bracket. For example,\r\nif a bracket has been established for the target at 3000 and 3200 m.,\r\nthe battery would fire at 2900, 3000, 3200, and 3300 m.\r\n\r\n    [316] Called “Zone Fire” in our field artillery. _Translator_.\r\n\r\n2. “Sweeping” (_fauchage_) is employed when it is desired to cover\r\na broader zone. In this every gun fires three rounds at each of the\r\nranges designated. The first round is fired with the line of sight\r\ndirected on the right portion of the target (or on the aiming point).\r\nBefore firing each of the succeeding rounds, the direction of the piece\r\nis changed to the left by three turns of the traversing handwheel. At\r\nthe next range this process is reversed, the direction of the piece\r\nbeing changed to the right by three turns of the traversing handwheel\r\nafter each round. At 2500 m., for example, a battery can cover, in this\r\nmanner, a space twice the width of its own front.\r\n\r\n3. “Fire at successive ranges” (searching fire). In this fire salvos\r\nor volleys are delivered at the target at a number of ranges to be\r\ndesignated by the battery commander.[317]\r\n\r\n    [317] The Belgian Drill Regulations (1907) give the following\r\n  details in regard to the fire effect of a French four gun battery: In\r\n  “progressive fire” (_tir progressif_), 32 rounds cover a space 100\r\n  m. wide and 400 m. deep (1 fragment covers 6 sq. m.). When direct\r\n  laying is employed, one fragment covers 2 sq. m. In “progressive fire\r\n  with sweeping” (_tir progressif avec fauchage_), 48 shrapnel cover a\r\n  space 200 m. wide and 400 m. deep, each fragment covering 8 sq. m.\r\n  Depending upon the range, 1¹⁄₂ to 5 minutes are required to secure\r\n  adjustment. (See p. 119 supra).\r\n\r\nDuring the Russo-Japanese war, all close order formations proved\r\nunsuitable under artillery fire, except when the terrain afforded\r\ncover. The Japanese infantry recognized very soon that the best\r\nprotection against artillery fire lay in constant motion (irregular\r\nrushes made by small units) and in wide extension. The following\r\nprocedure, employed at Yoshirei on July 31st, 1904, seems worthy of\r\nimitation:[318] The several platoons of the companies followed each\r\nother in deployed lines at distances of 200-300 m. When they had to\r\ncross open ground in order to reach a designated line, the platoons\r\nsought to advance by squads, whose men were deployed at intervals of\r\n5-10 paces and who moved at a rapid gait interrupted by breathing\r\nspells. The men invariably assembled when cover was reached. The losses\r\nwere insignificant. The Russians also made use of a similar procedure\r\nafter their first disastrous experiences. In many instances the\r\nplatoons ran forward in single rank. “Change of gait and direction, as\r\nwell as the use of loose irregular skirmish lines make it difficult for\r\nthe artillery to hit anything.” (Par. 450 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [318] SIR IAN HAMILTON, _A Staff Officer’s Scrap Book_, I, p. 337.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormations used by Infantry during the Russo-Japanese War when under\r\nArtillery Fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: a.\r\n\r\nA platoon in route column forms four columns of files.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: b.\r\n\r\nA company in column of platoons, each in line of skirmishers with the\r\nmen 2-4 m. apart.\r\n\r\n(It would be better to use sections instead of platoons).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: c.\r\n\r\nThe ranks of the sections in each platoon of the company following each\r\nother at a distance of 100 m.\r\n\r\nThis formation was taken up from company column (German).]\r\n\r\nThese formations made it possible to advance at a walk to within 3000\r\nm. of a hostile position; beyond that an advance by rushes had to\r\nbe resorted to, in which the attacking force avoided showing itself\r\nsimultaneously in long lines. The simplest scheme might be to move\r\nforward in column of sections, each section in skirmish line. Formation\r\n“a” is well adapted for quickly crossing fire swept places, and when\r\nthere is hope of re-forming the column subsequently. Formation “c”\r\nis suitable for quickly deploying from company column. However, the\r\nlast-named formation no longer guarantees a proper leading of the\r\ncompany, and quite naturally does not absolutely prevent losses. After\r\nthe Japanese 5th Brigade (Nambu) had taken possession of Yuhuntun[319]\r\nand the three houses during the night of March 6/7, 1905, the following\r\ndispositions for attack were made by the Russians about noon on the\r\n7th: On the right, the 5th and 10th Rifle Regiments, in five lines,\r\neach consisting of one battalion (total depth of the formation 600 m.);\r\nin the center, the 123rd Infantry (Koslov) of which the companies of\r\nthree battalions were deployed in single rank lines, each consisting\r\nof one company, with the men at intervals of from 3 to 5 paces, the\r\ncompanies in rear of each other at distances of 100 paces; the IVth\r\nBattalion, similarly formed, was posted in echelon to the left rear.\r\nThe 124th Infantry advanced on the left flank. The Koslov Regiment,\r\nadvancing without hesitation in quick time and at attention, was fired\r\non by three Japanese batteries while it was moving from 4000 to 2000 m.\r\nThe regiment lost about 600 men. This loss is insignificant when the\r\nsize of the target (about 600 m. wide and 1000 m. deep) is considered.\r\nThe Japanese did not care to become involved in a serious infantry\r\naction and therefore evacuated the place. It would have been better\r\nto advance by rushes with smaller units, as the terrain afforded no\r\ncover whatever. Whenever the Japanese had sufficient time, they crossed\r\nsuch plains singly, one by one, and then assembled under cover for the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n    [319] V.

The effect of frontal fire on\r\nartillery whose guns are protected by shields is so small that the\r\nexpenditure of ammunition is not justifiable.[320] The gap between the\r\nsteel shields of the French field gun is not large enough to exert a\r\nnoticeable influence. Steel shields, 3 mm. thick, afford protection\r\nagainst steel jacketed bullets fired at or beyond 300 m.; against\r\n“S” and “D” projectiles they afford protection, it is said, beyond\r\n500 m. only. Machine guns directing continuous fire on a point may\r\nobtain better results. According to firing tests 3 mm. armor plate\r\ncan be pierced up to 1000 m. only by special projectiles (solid steel\r\nprojectiles and those having a steel core), the adoption of which is\r\nprecluded on practical grounds (variations in sectional density, and\r\ndifficulty of manufacture).[321] For this reason, it is better to leave\r\nthe task of destroying shielded batteries, even when they are in the\r\nopen, to one’s own artillery, than to attack them with infantry. The\r\nfire effect of the infantry is not noticeably increased when delivered\r\nobliquely against the front of the battery. (Par. 184 German I. D. R.).\r\nIn Germany the gun commander and cannoneer No. 3, who is posted at the\r\ntrail, are then especially endangered; but in order to flank the guns\r\neffectively and to reach in rear of the shields with its fire, the\r\ninfantry must move to a flank a distance at least equal to ¹⁄₃ of the\r\nrange, and even then the fire effect is very small. The effect may even\r\nbe entirely nullified when the flanking fire is delivered from the side\r\non which the caisson bodies are posted. In this case it suffices to\r\npush forward the caisson body to protect the personnel. It is a good\r\nplan for infantry to direct its fire on the limbers and the reserve.\r\nAnd again, infantry should not let any opportunity pass to fire on\r\nartillery in motion or in the act of limbering or unlimbering within\r\neffective range. Guns moved by hand into positions from which direct\r\nlaying can be employed for the purpose of warding off the infantry\r\nattack, offer particularly favorable targets. Infantry that is to\r\ncapture artillery must approach its objective by means of irregular\r\nrushes made by small groups, and increase its fire to the utmost\r\nintensity when the limbers are brought up to the guns. The effect of\r\nartillery fire is small under 200 m., in the absence of canister.[322]\r\n\r\n    [320] Even prior to the adoption of shields it was demonstrated\r\n  that infantry was unable to destroy the matériel of batteries\r\n  so as to render them immobile; it could only interfere with the\r\n  _personnel_, but could not demolish the batteries.\r\n\r\n    [321] _Mitteilungen über Gegenstände des Artillerie und\r\n  Geniewesens_, 1907, No. 5.\r\n\r\n    [322] The capture of the Smolenski Artillery Battalion on October\r\n  14th, 1904 (Shaho). _Artilleristische Monatshefte_ for March, 1908.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Germany.\r\n\r\nField Howitzer.\r\n\r\nField Gun.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: France.]\r\n\r\nThe disaster which overtook Trautmann’s Battery at St. Hubert, during\r\nthe battle of Gravelotte, demonstrates how difficult it is to unlimber\r\non open ground when under effective infantry and artillery fire; but,\r\nif five limbers with their teams had not stampeded, perhaps it might\r\nhave been possible after a while, for the battery to reopen fire.\r\nHasse’s Battery, also at St. Hubert, was rendered incapable of moving\r\nin a short time, but, in spite of the greatest difficulties, managed to\r\ncontinue its fire for about two hours, though with only a part of the\r\nguns. Gnügge’s Battery managed to unlimber under cover of a garden wall\r\nat St. Hubert and to maintain itself there under enfilading infantry\r\nfire till the end of the battle. Trautmann’s Battery lost 17 men and 37\r\nhorses; Hasse’s Battery, 38 men and 77 horses; and Gnügge’s Battery, 15\r\nmen and 40 horses.[323]\r\n\r\n    [323] HOFFBAUER, _Deutsche Artillerie_, III, p. 227.\r\n\r\nUnlimbering under uninterrupted hostile fire at short range will always\r\nproduce conditions similar to those in Trautmann’s Battery, and in\r\nthe two British batteries of Colonel Long at Colenso.[324] These two\r\nbatteries did not cease firing because they had suffered too heavily,\r\nbut only because they had expended all their limber ammunition and the\r\ncaissons were unable to come up. It was impossible for these batteries\r\nto limber up under the hostile fire. It was likewise impossible to\r\ndestroy a battery, though without protecting shields, even when great\r\nquantities of ammunition were expended.\r\n\r\n    [324] _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 32, p. 43.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Beaumont, the artillery of the 7th Infantry Division\r\nsuffered heavy losses. “Although the first caisson sections were up and\r\nthe men with them were detailed to assist in working the guns, the gun\r\nsquads in both batteries had dwindled down to 2 or 3 men each by 1 P.\r\nM., _i.e._, within half an hour.” Immediately after the French attack\r\nhad been repulsed, one of these batteries was able to accompany the\r\nadvancing infantry, however, while the other (the 4th Light Battery)\r\ncould not move its guns until an hour later, as it had lost 29 men and\r\n34 horses.[325] This example proves again that when artillery has once\r\nmanaged to go into position and to open fire, it cannot be annihilated\r\nby infantry alone, and therefore need not fear to take up a more than\r\ntemporary position in the first line.\r\n\r\n    [325] HOFFBAUER, _Deutsche Artillerie_, 8, pp. 44 and 210.\r\n\r\n    HOPFFGARTEN-HEIDLER, _Beaumont_, p. 40.\r\n\r\nThe best way for artillery to protect itself against annoyance from\r\nhostile infantry fire is to push forward an infantry screen, even\r\nif only a weak one. In the days when batteries had no shields, this\r\nscreen enabled artillery to devote its entire attention to the\r\nprincipal target without regard to hostile infantry. At the present\r\ntime, especially in positions in rear of a crest and in long artillery\r\nlines, the principal object of such a screen is to prevent hostile\r\npatrols from molesting the artillery. Small detachments posted at wide\r\nintervals are sufficient for this purpose. The flanks and rear are now\r\nas in the past the vulnerable points and are most exposed to daring,\r\nsudden attacks, even if only made by weak hostile detachments. (Par.\r\n448 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n  At the battle of =Vionville=,[326] about 5 P. M., four horse and\r\n  seven field batteries of the IIIrd Army Corps were engaged near\r\n  =Flavigny= with ten French batteries. After this artillery duel had\r\n  lasted half an hour, French Guard Infantry advanced to the attack.\r\n  This was repulsed by artillery fire at a range of 800 m., but the\r\n  fire of the artillery was diverted from its proper objective by the\r\n  advance of this infantry. Similarly, at =St. Privat=, two batteries\r\n  of the Guard Artillery had to direct their fire on French skirmishers.\r\n\r\n    [326] _Gen St. W._, I, p. 557.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE ATTACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defense may repulse the enemy, but only the attack can annihilate\r\nhim. The decision as to whether the force is to attack or stand on\r\nthe defensive depends upon the tactical situation and the will of the\r\ncommander, and not upon numerical superiority, of which one is not\r\naware, as a rule, until after the battle.[327] Determined attacks,\r\nagain and again repeated, in spite of all failures, are the surest\r\nmeans of gaining victory and of preventing the enemy from becoming\r\naware of his superiority. Only pressing reasons (marked hostile\r\nsuperiority, necessity for awaiting approaching reinforcements, or\r\nthe failure of an attack), and never favorable terrain conditions,\r\nshould determine a commander to stand on the defensive. In defense the\r\neventual assumption of the offensive is kept constantly in view. A\r\ncommander who voluntarily stands on the defensive for the purpose of\r\nletting the opponent attack, and then attacks him in turn, reaps only\r\nthe disadvantages and never the advantages of both the offensive and\r\nthe defensive.\r\n\r\n    [327] See _Taktik_, V, p. 121, et seq.\r\n\r\nThe attack may take various forms, depending upon whether the\r\ndispositions have to be made under hostile fire (surprise and\r\nrencontre), or whether the enemy has renounced the initiative and\r\nawaits the attack in a deployed formation, or in a position prepared\r\nfor defense (deliberately planned attack). In the last case the\r\nattack requires more careful preparation and in many instances even\r\nnecessitates the employment of special auxiliaries (such as guns\r\ncapable of high angle fire, and engineer trains). However, the advance\r\nof a strong firing line to within assaulting distance of the enemy, and\r\nthe uninterrupted fight for the superiority of fire, are common to all\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nAside from the attack against an enemy in position and the rencontre\r\nthere is an attack formation more closely resembling the rencontre in\r\ncharacter, which may be called the _abridged attack_.[328] This attack\r\nformation is used in forestalling the enemy in occupying important\r\npoints, in preventing enveloping movements, in carrying out flank\r\nattacks, in surprising the enemy, in warding off a hostile surprise,\r\nin relieving the pressure on a neighboring force, etc. It is moreover\r\nappropriate where the conformation of the ground or the time of day\r\nprohibit a use of the rifle.\r\n\r\n    [328] _Abgekürzter Angriff_.\r\n\r\n  The first stages of the fight of the 6th Infantry Division at\r\n  =Vionville= are of this character. The fire fight was relegated to\r\n  the background in view of the constant movement to the front. The\r\n  situation prohibited our properly taking advantage of our superior\r\n  marksmanship.--The attack on the railroad cut of =Nuits=, during the\r\n  late afternoon of December 18th, 1870, progressed similarly.[329]\r\n\r\n    [329] KUNZ, _Gefecht von Nuits_, p. 19, et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE SURPRISE.[330]\r\n\r\n    [330] See _Taktik_, V, p. 190.\r\n\r\nInsufficient reconnaissance may place a force in a situation where it\r\nwill be obliged to go into action directly from route column or from\r\na formation unsuitable for combat, against an enemy who unexpectedly\r\nopens a lively fire at short range, thus increasing the moral effect of\r\nthe surprise by actually inflicting losses. The force which is taken by\r\nsurprise will without doubt overrate the seriousness of the situation\r\nand will be inclined to overestimate the strength and morale of the\r\nopposing force. This must be taken into account in coming to a decision.\r\n\r\nAbove all else, it is important to develop, as promptly as possible,\r\na fire effect at least equivalent to that of the enemy, to let the\r\ntroops regain confidence, and to secure the initiative. A bold\r\ndecision is best calculated to extricate a force from such a critical\r\nsituation.[331] It is of little use to deploy, take cover, and open\r\nfire, when the enemy is well concealed; a decision to retire is still\r\nless to be approved, because at short ranges it is bound to lead to a\r\ncomplete annihilation of the force. As a rule, a defeat can only be\r\naverted, in such a case, by assuming the offensive and thus repulsing\r\nthe enemy. The decision for attacking directly from route column\r\n(or, when the enemy is still at a distance, at least for deploying\r\ntoward the front) is the more justifiable, since an enemy who prepares\r\nan ambuscade for us is, as a rule, conscious of his inferiority in\r\nnumbers, morale, and training, and resorts to deceit because he does\r\nnot dare to meet us in the open. Therefore, overwhelm the enemy with\r\nfire and then charge him with the bayonet. An impetuous advance may\r\nperhaps intimidate him, and our losses will be less, at any rate, than\r\nif we turn our backs on him and await our fate in what is at best but\r\na poor position, as it is taken up, as a rule, during the first moment\r\nof panic. However, even if a force that is taken by surprise cannot\r\navert disaster by making a determined counter-attack, it can at least\r\nsave its honor and morale. This is equally true of the rencontre on the\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\n    [331] “No matter how unexpectedly the enemy may appear, you should\r\n  never forget that he may be annihilated either with the bayonet or\r\n  with fire. The choice between the two is not a difficult one, and the\r\n  formation to be adopted is of secondary importance. When the enemy\r\n  is at close quarters, always use the bayonet; if he is still at a\r\n  distance, fire on him, and then use the bayonet.” DRAGOMIROV.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of Surprises.\r\n\r\n  The surprise at =Baalon= on September 17th, 1870.[332] The surprise\r\n  at =Vouziers= on December 15th, 1870.[333] The conduct of the French\r\n  infantry when surprised in its camp at =Beaumont=.\r\n\r\n    [332] CARDINAL VON WIDDERN, _Krieg an den rückwärtigen\r\n  Verbindungen_, I, p. 149.\r\n\r\n    [333] _Ibid._, II, p. 125.\r\n\r\n  During the battle of =Noisseville= there occurred an unusually\r\n  instructive episode, the disastrous results of which could have been\r\n  easily avoided if the mounted officers on duty with the force had\r\n  been sent out to reconnoiter. Six companies of the 44th Infantry\r\n  (Prussian) were advancing from =Flanville= against =Montoy=. On\r\n  the French side, the 62nd Infantry was likewise advancing against\r\n  Flanville and had arrived at Montoy when the 44th Infantry (Prussian)\r\n  very unexpectedly appeared on its left flank. The French regimental\r\n  commander decided to attack at once. “The Prussian detachments\r\n  advancing south of Montoy were about to scale the west slope of\r\n  the ravine near there, when, at very short range, they suddenly\r\n  encountered the rapid fire of a dense French skirmish line, which was\r\n  immediately followed by the counter-attack, consisting of columns\r\n  in close order. At the same moment, the left flank of the Prussians\r\n  was attacked from the south, and other hostile columns advanced from\r\n  the park through the west entrance of the village. The Prussian\r\n  skirmish lines were repulsed in an instant, and thrown into complete\r\n  confusion. The hostile fire had an annihilating effect on account of\r\n  the short range, and the situation was at once completely reversed.\r\n  The Prussians sought in vain to gain a firm foothold in the eastern\r\n  outskirts of the village of Montoy. Their losses were heavy. The four\r\n  companies (3rd, 9th, 11th and 12th) of the 44th Infantry numbered\r\n  in all 18 officers and 840 men; they lost 7 officers and 480 men,\r\n  of which number 1 officer and 82 men (all unharmed) were taken\r\n  prisoners. The 9th Company suffered least; but the 3rd, 11th and\r\n  12th Companies (44th Infantry) lost in all 55.5% of their effective\r\n  strength, the 3rd Company even losing 67%.”[334]\r\n\r\n    [334] KUNZ, _Noisseville_, p. 32, et seq.\r\n\r\n  This surprise could without doubt have been avoided. If the 44th\r\n  Infantry had sent mounted men ahead, it would have been in a position\r\n  to let the French walk into its fire. Soon after this occurrence,\r\n  the French infantry also unexpectedly received flanking fire from\r\n  Flanville, which forced it to abandon the pursuit after suffering\r\n  some losses.\r\n\r\nWhen two forces unexpectedly collide in close country, the advantage\r\nrests decidedly with the one that opens fire and advances to the charge\r\nfirst. This onslaught with cold steel should become second nature\r\nto the troops. In traversing close country, a force should be in a\r\nformation that enables it to develop an adequate fire and to make a\r\ncharge in compact formation. A line formation is entirely unsuitable,\r\nas a rule, on account of the difficulties of the terrain to be\r\novercome, and in a skirmish line the officers cannot properly control\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\nFor passing through thinly scattered timber without underbrush,[335]\r\ncompany column is a suitable formation, and for dense woods platoons\r\nadvancing either abreast or echeloned, each platoon in line of squads\r\nin columns of files. If the platoons or sections were to advance in\r\nsingle file, the columns would be too long, and it would be next to\r\nimpossible to maintain the intervals. The six or eight small columns\r\nof files of a platoon are, on the other hand, close enough together to\r\nkeep each other in view; besides, they are easily and quickly deployed\r\nfor firing and charging, and can meander through the woods more readily\r\nthan an organization in close order. Moreover, the leaders can exercise\r\nbetter control over the men than in skirmish line, which invariably\r\nbunches up at the places that are most easily passed, while connection\r\nis not maintained at all at other points and march direction and\r\ncohesion is lost.

THE RENCONTRE.[337]\r\n\r\n(Pars. 315-317 and 352-361 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [337] See also _Taktik_, V, p. 192, et seq.\r\n\r\n“Uncertainty and haziness of the situation are the rule in war. During\r\nmarches in campaign the opponents will frequently not gain detailed\r\ninformation of each other until they come into actual contact. Thus\r\nthe rencontre develops out of a collision of route columns.” (Par. 352\r\nGerman I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nBoth forces are marching toward each other, and the collision occurs\r\nfrequently at a point not intended by either; as every minute brings\r\nthe heads of the two columns closer together no time is to be lost.\r\nThe commander who desires to wait until he can come to a decision\r\nconsonant with the results of the reconnaissance will arrive too late.\r\nThe tactical situation in its entirety determines whether or not an\r\nattack should be made. If we do not take advantage of the fleeting\r\nmoment the enemy will surely do so, and, as a rule, he will not be\r\nany better prepared for action than we are. Frequently the deployment\r\nfrom route column is not made because the commander desires it, but\r\nbecause it is necessary in order to avert a crisis in the leading line.\r\nThe commander who is acting under hostile pressure should endeavor to\r\nregain the upper hand as quickly as possible so that he can dispose\r\nof the troops of the main body with a definite object in view. In a\r\nrencontre, the advantage rests almost invariably with the commander\r\nwho quickly sizes up the situation, attacks promptly, and succeeds in\r\nthrowing the opponent on the defensive. A bold, impetuous attack, which\r\nwould lead to disaster in the presence of an opponent already deployed,\r\nmay, in this case, be productive of victory. The direction in which the\r\nattack is made is of less importance than a prompt decision on the part\r\nof the commander and the simultaneous launching of the whole force in a\r\ndefinite direction. We must take the terrain as we find it. In covered\r\nterrain, the effect of the surprise will be increased still more, while\r\nin open country, the preparatory stage of the combat will soon lose\r\nthat character, because the side which has an advantage as regards\r\nterrain will make use of it, and the conviction will force itself upon\r\nthe opponent that victory cannot be gained by an impetuous attack\r\nalone. It will be easy for a commander to come to a decision as to the\r\naction to be taken if he is conscious of his own strength or fears that\r\nthe enemy desires to avoid an attack. (The commanders of the advanced\r\ntroops of the IIIrd Army Corps at Vionville). _The rencontre increases\r\nthe difficulties of troop leading, but makes the attack easier for the\r\ntroops._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe difference between a deliberately planned attack and a rencontre is\r\nmost clearly apparent in the conduct of the advance guard. Its task is\r\nto secure the prospective artillery position and to create favorable\r\nconditions for the combat of the main body. This requires that ground\r\nbe gained to the front so as to enable the main body to deploy while\r\nmoving forward. In addition, the advance guard should seize and hold\r\nimportant points, without, however, anticipating the intentions of\r\nthe commander of the whole force. It is moreover desirable for the\r\nadvance guard to interfere with the hostile deployment. Points lying\r\non the flanks or in advance of the artillery position, especially if\r\nthey command the latter, should be quickly seized; when necessary, the\r\nadvance guard must fight for their possession. Its commander should\r\nquickly pick out the points that are important for this purpose; he\r\nshould, by no means, be satisfied always to begin the fight where the\r\npoint of the advance guard happens to be. Under certain circumstances\r\nthe main body will have to concentrate for action farther to the rear\r\nso as to hasten the deployment and to take advantage of favorable\r\nterrain. When the enemy has an undeniable start in deployment, the\r\ncommander may decide to let the opponent advance to the attack, and\r\nthen bring about the decision by simultaneously launching his main\r\nbody. Only thus can one in the long run avoid fighting superior\r\nnumbers with an inferior force. (Par. 360 German I. D. R.). It is much\r\neasier to decide whether this or that point is of importance, than to\r\nanswer the question as to whether the strength of the advance guard\r\nwill suffice for the task of taking it. The reports of the cavalry in\r\nregard to the enemy’s strength and the composition and formation of his\r\ncolumns, will scarcely furnish an adequate basis for a pertinent answer\r\nto this question. Moreover, one will usually not be able to tell,\r\nuntil after the action has commenced, how far the hostile deployment\r\nhas progressed. But, in any case, long hostile firing lines demand\r\ncaution. However, a start in deployment is not indicated by the combat\r\nfrontage alone. A factor of far greater importance is which force has\r\nbeen most successful in making preparations for going into action by\r\ndeveloping its main body and by having artillery near at hand. It is\r\nartillery that clears up the situation. When an infantry division\r\nencounters a hostile force deployed on a front of 400-600 m., this\r\ndoes not necessarily mean that the entire division must systematically\r\nconcentrate for action, as this would cause a considerable loss\r\nof time, thus giving the enemy a great advantage. _The general\r\nsituation and the mission of a force are of greater importance for the\r\ncommander’s decision, than the state of readiness for action of the\r\nopposing forces._\r\n\r\n_Issue of orders._ See _Taktik_, V, p. 197.\r\n\r\nThe advance guard must be promptly informed of the intentions of the\r\ncommander (_i.e._, whether he intends to attack, to concentrate for\r\nattack farther to the rear, or to let the enemy attack[338]) and of the\r\nlocation of the prospective artillery position. The attack order should\r\nbe withheld until the combat of the advance guard has sufficiently\r\ncleared the situation, but a development of the force should be ordered\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n    [338] Par. 350 German I. D. R.\r\n\r\nThe advanced detachments should endeavor to gain a start in deployment\r\nover the enemy and cover the advancing artillery in front and flank,\r\nby quickly deploying strong firing lines and pushing machine guns to\r\nthe front. After they have done this, they should promptly advance\r\nto the attack. Through this, our firing line, while in the act of\r\ndeploying, runs the serious risk of suddenly encountering, at short\r\nrange, the fire of superior hostile troops, at a time when all the\r\ntroops approaching the field are still too far distant to increase its\r\nfire power.[339] Whether the quickly formed firing lines should at once\r\nmove forward to the attack in a rencontre, depends upon the impressions\r\nreceived by the commander. His dispositions should be such as to compel\r\nthe enemy to disclose his available forces at an early moment. Every\r\nfighting line is so sensitive to fire simultaneously delivered against\r\nits front and flank, that an attempt to turn the hostile position will\r\ninstantly force the enemy to take counter-measures. If the enemy is\r\nunable to keep pace with us in deploying a firing line, if he is unable\r\nto deploy skirmish lines as dense as ours, this state of affairs\r\nshould induce our commander to proceed to the attack; if the reverse\r\nstate of affairs exists, he should await the arrival of reinforcements.\r\nBut in order to obtain this insight into the existing situation the\r\ntroops must get close to the enemy. Such an insight into the hostile\r\ndispositions cannot be gained at long range. The extent of a hostile\r\nposition may perhaps be determined at long range with the best field\r\nglasses, but the strength and power of resistance of the enemy can\r\nnever be gauged in this manner. If one threatens to push an attack\r\nhome, however, the enemy will be compelled to show his hand. When\r\nopposed by an enemy whose strength is unknown, it will unquestionably\r\nbe necessary to approach to the extreme limit of short ranges. From\r\nhere the dispositions of the enemy may be clearly recognized, and, in\r\naddition, at 600-800 m., a firing line that has made a lodgment in\r\nsome feature of the terrain will not as yet be exposed to annihilating\r\nlosses. Misconceptions are scarcely to be avoided in such a situation.\r\nOne must trust to luck and take some risks. On the other hand, the\r\ntraining of the infantry should afford the assurance that it will not\r\ngive up the position it has once reached; it should firmly hold the\r\nground gained, and persevere.[340]\r\n\r\n    [339] This induces the British _Infantry Training_ to prescribe\r\n  that in a rencontre a concentration for attack should invariably be\r\n  ordered.\r\n\r\n    [340] Military history furnishes a multitude of examples of\r\n  the fact that a force can persevere in spite of the most galling\r\n  fire (St. Privat. Gorni Dubniac). A reverse does not occur, as a\r\n  rule, until the advent of unforeseen circumstances. The Brigade of\r\n  Highlanders held out for hours at Magersfontain, and an insignificant\r\n  change of front on the right flank subsequently caused the whole line\r\n  to retire. See _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 32, p. 74.\r\n\r\nWhen infantry is compelled to go into action, the necessity of\r\noccupying important supporting points and of gaining ground for the\r\nconcentration for action, requires a broad front to be covered. (Par.\r\n357 German I. D. R.). The artillery, which will arrive soon thereafter,\r\nwill then bring relief to the infantry in critical situations.\r\n\r\nIn every rencontre there comes a moment when the fight is at a\r\nstandstill. At this moment an attentive observer may notice that,\r\nalthough it is impossible to push the attack home without further\r\nreinforcements, the space in which the concentration for action is to\r\ntake place, is secured against a hostile attack, or that the enemy has\r\nbeen deprived of the initiative and has been thrown on the defensive.\r\nThis is the moment in which the commander regains the initiative\r\nand in which, by means of an _attack order_, he can dispose of the\r\ntroops of the main body as he sees fit. _The “rencontre” differs\r\nfrom the “deliberately planned attack,” in that, in the latter, the\r\nconcentration for action can proceed smoothly as desired by the\r\ncommander, while in a rencontre the opponent, for the time being,\r\ndictates the course of action. Therefore the commander should make\r\nefforts to free himself from this restraint, i.e., he should endeavor\r\nto launch his troops in a manner not influenced by the dispositions of\r\nthe enemy._\r\n\r\nThe degree of control which a commander retains over the course of the\r\ncombat depends upon the promptness with which he gains a general idea\r\nof the situation. For this, if for no other reason, he should be as\r\nnear the head of the column as possible while on the march. The troops\r\nsent first into action, supported by the artillery, must put every\r\navailable man into the fight, in order to repulse attacks made by the\r\nenemy and to enable the commander to launch the main body as an entity.\r\nIn any case, the battalions of the main body should not be successively\r\nthrown into the fight as soon as they arrive, for the purpose of\r\novercoming a temporary crisis, or for relieving the advance guard from\r\na dilemma. The machine gun batteries, whose employment was particularly\r\nimportant during the preparatory stage of the fight, should be\r\nwithdrawn as early as possible so as to be available as a reserve in\r\nthe hands of the commander.\r\n\r\nIn bringing the main body into action, deployments by the flank should\r\nbe avoided. The deployment should be initiated by subordinate units\r\n(in an infantry division, by regiments) moving out of the route column\r\nand toward the objective points determined by the purpose of the\r\ncombat.[341]\r\n\r\n    [341] General VON SCHLICHTING holds a different view in his work\r\n  _Taktische und strategische Grundsätze_, I, p. 106. “In a rencontre,\r\n  the piece on the board of the battlefield can be moved only when the\r\n  next one is clear of the march column and ready for action. Further\r\n  action is then not only permissible but imperative.”\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisions of Various Regulations.\r\n\r\n  In all the regulations, those of Germany excepted, the rencontre is\r\n  treated with marked reserve.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= “When a collision occurs with an opponent who is likewise\r\n  in the act of advancing--_rencontre_--the different parts of the\r\n  force and their subdivisions must make strenuous efforts to advance\r\n  in the designated direction. In a rencontre, it will be proper to\r\n  concentrate the main forces, prior to making the attack, only in case\r\n  it becomes apparent during the preparatory stage of the action that\r\n  the enemy has gained a visible start in deployment. The endeavor\r\n  to forestall the enemy, and the necessity of promptly reinforcing\r\n  the troops already engaged, will often curtail or preclude the\r\n  preparatory concentration of the main body in a rencontre, and force\r\n  the commander to permit at least parts of his approaching troops to\r\n  go directly into action.” If conditions are eminently favorable for\r\n  the enemy at the point where the collision occurs, it may sometimes\r\n  be more desirable to stand provisionally on the defensive with the\r\n  advance guard until other troops come up.\r\n\r\n  “Under such circumstances, it may even be advisable to withdraw the\r\n  troops covering the march; but in that event, the relation of the\r\n  force to neighboring columns should be considered.”\r\n\r\n  =France.= The commander should decide promptly whether to attack, to\r\n  stand on the defensive, or to avoid an engagement for the time being.\r\n  The regulations do not provide for employing the troops directly\r\n  from route column. The advance guard is frequently thrown on its own\r\n  resources; it is often forced to fight on a very broad front, and\r\n  to place all of its troops into action at the very beginning of an\r\n  engagement for the purpose of seizing and holding supporting points\r\n  necessary for the subsequent deployment.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples.\r\n\r\n  1. The deployment for action of the 5th Infantry Division from the\r\n  defile of Gorze, against the French Division Vergé, at the battle of\r\n  =Vionville= (16th August, 1870), is especially instructive.[342]\r\n\r\n    [342] _Gen.

LESSONS OF WAR.\r\n\r\n  During the =Boer War= (1899-1902), the British infantry always\r\n  attacked positions prepared for defense. Aside from the superannuated\r\n  fire tactics and deficient marksmanship training of the British,\r\n  their failures in the early engagements of the war may generally be\r\n  traced to the following causes:--\r\n\r\n  1. Insufficient reconnaissance. This caused British detachments to be\r\n  surprised, in a number of cases, by fire at short range. (Brigade of\r\n  the Guards at =Modder River=). In many instances, the British forces\r\n  were even surprised by fire while in close order formations. (Hart’s\r\n  Brigade at =Colenso=).\r\n\r\n  2. Pure frontal attacks, in which equal forces were frequently pitted\r\n  against each other. (=Modder River=, =Magersfontain=, =Colenso=).\r\n\r\n  3. Insufficient protection of the flanks by echelons against fire\r\n  surprises carried out by small detachments.\r\n\r\n  4. Insufficient coöperation of the artillery and infantry.\r\n\r\n  5. Isolated attacks made by brigades (consisting of 4 battalions).\r\n  The employment of several brigades simultaneously for concerted\r\n  action was a rare exception.\r\n\r\n  6. Insufficient support of the firing line. A timely reinforcement of\r\n  an organization that had already been shaken never did occur.\r\n\r\n  7. Hesitating use of reserves in the crisis of the fight. At\r\n  =Magersfontain= only 8¹⁄₂ battalions out of 13, and at =Colenso=\r\n  only 6 battalions out of 16¹⁄₂, had been seriously engaged. When\r\n  =Spionskop= was evacuated, 11 battalions had not as yet been engaged.\r\n  The attacks were begun, but not pushed home.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Infantry Attack in the Russo-Japanese War.\r\n\r\n  The combat tactics of the Russian infantry[345] (Russian I. D. R.\r\n  of 1903) were based on shock action, narrow frontage, and deep\r\n  formations. The bayonet training preached by Dragomirov was the\r\n  result of the belief in decisive psychological impressions and the\r\n  consciousness that the Russian fire tactics, based upon volley fire,\r\n  were inadequate to annihilate a well concealed defender. Thus, the\r\n  endeavor to cross blades with the opponent as quickly as possible,\r\n  led to a headlong rush to the front, without creating the preliminary\r\n  conditions necessary for pushing the attack home. The hesitation of\r\n  the higher commanders to throw in every available man at the decisive\r\n  stage, and the tendency, reaching down to the lowest grades, of\r\n  creating detachments and separate missions, contrasted unfavorably\r\n  with this splendid offensive spirit.\r\n\r\n    [345] “The Russian infantry is embued with a mixture of defensive\r\n  spirit and instinct for hand to hand fighting.” COUNT MARENZI.\r\n\r\n  The Japanese infantry was trained according to the letter and spirit\r\n  of the German regulations of 1889. It had fought shy of unhealthy\r\n  tendencies after the Boer war, cultivated the independence and\r\n  initiative of all leaders, and recognized the necessity of night\r\n  combats and of using the spade. In addition, the way for success was\r\n  carefully, almost cautiously, prepared by the commander-in-chief, who\r\n  left nothing to chance. It is easy for subordinate leaders to be bold\r\n  and daring, when they know that the commander-in-chief has neglected\r\n  nothing to ensure victory. The principal characteristics of the\r\n  Japanese combats were--\r\n\r\n  1. The cautious advance, frequently under cover of darkness;\r\n\r\n  2. The systematic preparation of the attack by the coöperation of\r\n  infantry and artillery, and the determined advance along the whole\r\n  front;\r\n\r\n  3. The attempt to induce the enemy to launch infantry at a point\r\n  where the decisive attack was not to take place;[346]\r\n\r\n    [346] The advance of the Vth Army at Mukden.\r\n\r\n  4. The sudden launching of the decisive attack;\r\n\r\n  5. The prompt preparation of every captured position for defense;\r\n\r\n  6. The absence of pursuit.\r\n\r\n  The fights at =Wafangu=,[347] as well as the attack made by the Guard\r\n  and the 12th Division at the =Yalu=[348] proceeded entirely according\r\n  to German pattern.\r\n\r\n    [347] _Einzelschriften über den Russisch-Japanischen Krieg_,\r\n  Vienna, 1906, I, p. 226. The envelopment of the Russian right flank\r\n  by the Japanese 19th Brigade is especially instructive.\r\n\r\n    [348] _Ibid._, I, p. 79, et seq. _Kriegsgeschichtliche\r\n  Einzelschriften_, 39-40, p. 123, et seq. Consult also VON LÜTTWITZ,\r\n  _Angriffsverfahren der Japaner_, p. 2.\r\n\r\n  A change took place in the tactical methods of the Japanese when the\r\n  Russian artillery--whose ballistic properties were superior to those\r\n  of its antagonist--brought a greater number of guns into the field,\r\n  and when, in addition, the Japanese infantry became numerically\r\n  inferior in the battles after Liao Yang.[349]\r\n\r\n    [349] The statements in regard to the strength of the opposing\r\n  forces are still very contradictory. At Liao Yang 120,000 Japanese\r\n  confronted 150,000 Russians; at Mukden the Russians had perhaps\r\n  10,000 rifles, 300 field guns, and 100 heavy pieces of ordnance more\r\n  than the Japanese.\r\n\r\n  The task set commanders of armies and leaders of troops by the\r\n  government, had to be met by a continuance of the offensive.[350]\r\n  The peculiar character of the theater of war made it difficult to\r\n  maneuver the enemy out of his strong positions; so at best nothing\r\n  remained for the Japanese--unless they wished to renounce the\r\n  offensive entirely--but to conquer the enemy by attacking him in\r\n  front. Since the advantages of the attack--superior numbers and the\r\n  freedom of choosing the point of attack--were thus dissipated, the\r\n  victory had to be gained by making use of defensive expedients. As\r\n  the demoralizing and retarding effect produced by fire increased\r\n  more rapidly than the morale of the assailant, nothing remained but\r\n  to intrench and to take advantage of the cover afforded by darkness\r\n  as in fortress warfare. Moreover, the inferior forces available\r\n  precluded deep formations and necessitated an immediate development\r\n  of the entire force in one line. Thus the desire to push forward\r\n  resolved itself into an advance along a broad front. Favored by the\r\n  purely passive conduct of the Russians, this led to an envelopment of\r\n  their flanks and a pressure on their line of retreat. The Japanese\r\n  were able to overcome the constantly growing power of resistance\r\n  of the Russian defense, because, while strictly adhering to the\r\n  offensive, they availed themselves of defensive expedients although\r\n  their movements were retarded thereby.\r\n\r\n    [350] C. H. _Über das innere Wesen der japanischen und\r\n  neuzeitlichen Offensive. Streffleur_, 1907, October number.\r\n\r\n  The conduct of the attack was, of course, considerably influenced\r\n  by the character of the terrain. The 1st Army, fighting in hilly\r\n  country, perhaps remained true longer to regulation formations and\r\n  long rushes than the other Japanese forces, but was finally obliged\r\n  to resort to a wide extension of closed bodies. The IInd and IVth\r\n  Armies were differently situated, as the attack over open plains fell\r\n  to their lot.\r\n\r\n  Speaking generally, the following details may be given in regard\r\n  to the method of attack of the Ist Japanese Army:[351] Units were\r\n  pushed into action abreast; objective points were assigned to each;\r\n  and certain lines or points, according to which they had to maintain\r\n  touch, were indicated to subordinate units. To avoid a surprise, if\r\n  for no other reason, thin firing lines were formed at the outset, and\r\n  in a serious attack whole companies, in dense firing lines capable of\r\n  developing a strong fire, were at once thrown in; these advanced to\r\n  mid ranges in order to open fire, as a rule, under 1000 m. The Ist\r\n  army had a special _penchant_ for making rushes of 80-100 m.,[352]\r\n  usually by entire companies; the assault was, in many instances,\r\n  begun as far as 300 m. from the hostile position, and then pushed\r\n  home; supports and reserves followed in extended formation, but\r\n  assembled promptly on reaching cover. The infantry was disinclined\r\n  to intrench during an advance, but never neglected to fortify\r\n  quickly a captured position. In the combats of the Ist Army we will\r\n  find the best lessons applicable to our conditions.\r\n\r\n    [351] _Streffleur_, 1907, January number.\r\n\r\n    [352] This is not true of the 4th Guard Regiment. See VON LÜTTWITZ,\r\n  _Angriffsverfahren der Japaner_, p. 24: Rushes of 50 m. were made\r\n  “as the men otherwise got out of breath and shot badly.” An advance\r\n  was made by squads and crawling was tabooed. The new Japanese Drill\r\n  Regulations warn against making rushes less than 30-40 m. long. On\r\n  the other hand, according to the opinion of von Lüttwitz, the length\r\n  of rushes will seldom exceed 100 m.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples.\r\n\r\n  1.

At 800 m., the line opened a lively fire at\r\n  will, which lasted for two minutes, and then advanced by rushes\r\n  by companies (first the right, then the left companies of the\r\n  battalions). During this advance the supports (2 battalions) were\r\n  absorbed by the firing line. At the same time the brigade reserve\r\n  approached closer to the firing line (the original distance between\r\n  reserve and firing line, before the advance began, was 300 m.). The\r\n  last halt for firing was made at 250 m., from the enemy’s position,\r\n  and the latter was then carried in one rush.

On the use of sand\r\n  bags, consult _ibid._, pp. 236 and 292.\r\n\r\n  Confidential British instructions dealing with the tactical lessons\r\n  of the =Russo-Japanese war=, make the following deductions:\r\n  “* * * * The above shows the great importance of local reconnaissance\r\n  by infantry, of which considerably more must be demanded than has been\r\n  done up to the present time in European armies. It shows, moreover,\r\n  the advantages of thin firing lines during the preparatory stage of\r\n  the action, and the insignificant effect produced by shrapnel and\r\n  long range fire on such lines in which it is desirable to advance,\r\n  without halting on the way, to within 1000 yards of the enemy. The\r\n  necessity of gaining a superiority of fire before advancing to the\r\n  assault, and the necessity of an increased supply of ammunition, are\r\n  confirmed anew. It is further demonstrated that the bayonet of the\r\n  infantryman is still capable of playing an important role in battle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH SUCCESS DEPENDS.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Japanese war confirms the opinion that the issue of combat\r\nis but little influenced by the formations taken up; that _esprit_\r\nand the determination to conquer are of far greater importance than\r\nany formation. The most difficult task that infantry can be called\r\nupon to perform consists of successfully pushing home an attack over\r\nopen ground commanded by hostile fire. “It would be wrong,” said\r\nFieldmarshal Moltke, “were one to attempt to lay down in regulations\r\nthat a force should not advance over a plain against an enemy under\r\ncover. _But every superior commander ought to consider what such an\r\noperation portends._” Heavy losses are unavoidable in a destructive\r\nfire fight lasting for hours.[361] The attack will not succeed so long\r\nas the enemy commands the plain with his fire. The commander of the\r\nattacking force must find ways and means to wrest this command from the\r\nenemy. All of the battles of recent campaigns have demonstrated that\r\nan attack is bound to succeed if it is thoroughly prepared by infantry\r\nand artillery fire, is undertaken by adequate forces, and is pushed\r\nwith determination close to the enemy; and that such an attack is, in\r\nfact, superior to the defensive. The success of an attack on a position\r\nprepared for defense might depend upon the following preliminary\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n(a) Careful reconnaissance, for the purpose of determining the most\r\nfavorable direction for the attack.\r\n\r\n(b) Occupation of the foreground of the hostile position. When the\r\nforeground is entirely open, an advance must be made under cover of\r\ndarkness up to the medium ranges.\r\n\r\n(c) Preparation of the infantry attack by the closest coöperation of\r\ninfantry and artillery.\r\n\r\n(d) Timely determination of the point at which the decisive attack is\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\n(e) Careful utilization of the terrain during the advance, so as to\r\nallow of delaying the opening of fire until the force is as close as\r\npossible to the enemy.\r\n\r\n(f) Suitable disposition, distribution in depth, and deployment of\r\na strong force for the purpose of bringing about a superiority of\r\ninfantry fire. The organization detailed to make the attack must have\r\nits entire effective strength available for accomplishing its proper\r\ntask, and not be compelled to detach parts for guarding its flanks.\r\n\r\n(g) Ensuring concerted and simultaneous action on the part of the\r\nattacking forces. As the enemy has given up any idea of assuming the\r\noffensive, at least for the time being, the attacker should not allow\r\nthe advantage to escape him of choosing time and direction of the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n    [361] General VON SCHLICHTING, in his work _Taktische und\r\n  strategische Grundsätze_, maintains the opinion--in contrast to\r\n  General VON SCHERFF--that open terrain commanded by hostile fire is\r\n  impassable for infantry. At any rate, military history has yet to\r\n  furnish proof of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PREPARATION OF THE ATTACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nReconnaissance. Preparatory Position.\r\n\r\n“If the enemy decides to stand on the defensive, he renounces the\r\ninitiative for the time being. The attacker will then have time to\r\nreconnoiter the hostile position and to weigh all the circumstances\r\nthat favor the attack. He should not limit himself to reconnaissance\r\nby the cavalry and to observation through field glasses. Mounted\r\nofficers’ and infantry officers’ patrols should supplement this\r\nreconnaissance, and complete the information gained as the enemy is\r\napproached.” (Pars. 362 and 363 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThe local reconnaissance (see p. 248 supra) should be conducted with\r\nall possible care; timely directions should be given in regard to\r\nit during the approach to the battlefield;[362] the activity of the\r\nreconnoitering bodies should continually increase as the enemy is\r\napproached; and the work itself should be divided in a systematic\r\nmanner. Excessive thoroughness may retard reconnaissance work to\r\nsuch an extent, on short winter days especially, that success may be\r\njeopardized. (Par. 305 German I. D. R.). As a result freedom of action\r\nwill be lost and the energy of the attack weakened. It would be wholly\r\nwrong to postpone the decision for making the attack until something\r\ndefinite is known of the strength and dispositions of the enemy.\r\nThese matters are almost never cleared up until after the battle. The\r\ndecision as to whether or not an attack should be made is determined\r\nprimarily by the general situation. (Par. 355 German I. D. R.). The\r\nlatter may force a commander to advance promptly without permitting\r\nhim to await the results of the reconnaissance. The character of the\r\nterrain and the preparation the enemy is known to have made, determine\r\nwhether the commander ought to attack at once, whether he ought to\r\nutilize the cover of darkness for the advance of the attacking troops,\r\nor whether he ought to attempt to maneuver the defender out of his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n    [362] According to experience the reconnaissance work generally\r\n  flags during a halt, although that is the very time when an increased\r\n  activity is desirable. The reconnaissance work in the IXth Corps on\r\n  August 18th, 1870, from the arrival at Caulre until the advance guard\r\n  opened the fight, is particularly instructive. _Der 18. August_, pp.\r\n  124, et seq. and 215.\r\n\r\nThe information required as a basis for this decision will, as a rule,\r\nnot be obtainable without a fight. In spite of all the objections\r\narrayed against reconnaissances in force, they cannot be avoided, if\r\nit is desired to gain prompt and certain insight into the enemy’s\r\nsituation. It cannot be expected that the defender will passively\r\npermit the assailant to gain an insight into his dispositions. A\r\nfeint will accomplish nothing; the enemy must be seriously engaged,\r\nso that he will show his hand.[363] Yet in spite of these combats,\r\nmisapprehensions are not precluded.\r\n\r\n    [363] It was the intention of the Japanese commander-in-chief, on\r\n  October 10th, 1904 (battle on the Shaho), to attack the Russian army\r\n  before it had completed its concentration for battle. The advance\r\n  guards of the Reserve Division and of the 5th Division encountered\r\n  advanced Russian detachments at Kushutsy (Xth Army Corps), and at\r\n  Wulitaisy (XVIIth Army Corps), whose weakness was, however, not\r\n  recognized. In the belief that the Russian main position had been\r\n  encountered, the advance on the hostile position was ordered for the\r\n  night 10/11th October, the attack to take place at daybreak on the\r\n  11th. 9th Supplement to the _Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1906, p. 327.\r\n\r\nIt is quite natural that isolated detachments, in their endeavor to\r\ngain an insight into the hostile dispositions, may find themselves\r\nsuddenly within short range of the enemy. In such a situation, the\r\ndetachment should maintain its position, as its fire will frequently\r\nfacilitate the approach of the other attacking troops. Almost every one\r\nof the more serious engagements furnishes examples illustrating this\r\nfeature.[364]\r\n\r\n    [364] The perseverance of Nambu’s Brigade on March 7th, in the\r\n  “three houses” (Yuhuntun near Mukden). _Vierteljahrshefte_, 1907,\r\n  p. 78. The perseverance of the troops in the Palungshan works,\r\n  captured on August 22nd, 1904, by being enveloped on both flanks.\r\n  (Port Arthur). _Streffleur_, _Einzelschriften_, 4, pp. 81 and 91.\r\n  The perseverance of parts of the IInd Battalion of the 3rd Guard\r\n  Regiment in the engagement at Towan (31st July, 1904). _Urteile und\r\n  Beobachtungen von Mitkämpfern_, I, p. 60.\r\n\r\nIn order to guard the reconnoitering troops from being driven back, if\r\nfor no other reason, it is advisable to place in readiness an adequate\r\nforce of artillery. As the artillery is protected by shields, it can\r\ntake up the fight even against superior artillery with better chances\r\nof succeeding than in the past.\r\n\r\nIf the commander has decided to attack and has determined against\r\nwhat part of the hostile position the main attack is to be made, the\r\nforeground of the hostile position is at once occupied, and the enemy’s\r\nadvanced troops forced back, so as to prevent the defender from gaining\r\nan insight into the dispositions of the assailant.\r\n\r\nThe assailant should launch as few troops as possible for initiating\r\nthe action. They should avoid engaging prematurely in a fire fight with\r\nthe infantry of the hostile main position, even if the terrain would\r\npermit a covered approach to short range. If the advanced troops allow\r\nthemselves to be enticed into doing this, they expose themselves to the\r\ndanger of suffering a defeat, and oblige the commander of the whole\r\nforce to launch for their relief troops that were intended for the main\r\nattack.[365]\r\n\r\n    [365] “It is a general principle to push as close as the terrain\r\n  permits to the enemy’s position with advance troops for the purpose\r\n  of opening fire.”\r\n\r\nInsufficient information in regard to the enemy and undue precipitation\r\nin issuing orders may place advanced troops in such an unfavorable\r\nsituation. If the defender allows himself to be tricked into assuming\r\nthe offensive for the purpose of driving off harassing detachments, so\r\nmuch the better for the assailant, for the latter’s artillery will then\r\nfind an opportunity to fire on the enemy.[366]\r\n\r\n    [366] The French regulations hint at this. Look up the advance of\r\n  French infantry during the combats around Ste. Marie aux Chênes. _Der\r\n  18. August_, pp. 174 and 179.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= “Under certain circumstances, the covering troops will\r\n  have to be reinforced at an early moment in order that a strong line\r\n  may be formed opposite the enemy, but, in many cases, they will\r\n  nevertheless still abstain from advancing into the zone of effective\r\n  fire.” The Austrians usually employ strong covering bodies. The\r\n  Germans desire to ensure simultaneous action on the part of all the\r\n  troops in opening the combat.\r\n\r\n  At =Spicheren= the commander of the 14th Infantry Division, under\r\n  the erroneous assumption that the heights of Spicheren were only\r\n  occupied by troops covering the entraining at Forbach, issued orders\r\n  to General von François to drive away the hostile artillery. All of\r\n  Frossard’s Corps, however, was in position on the heights on which\r\n  the artillery was posted.[367]\r\n\r\n    [367] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 310.\r\n\r\n  At 10 A. M., on August 6th, 1870, the commanding general of the Vth\r\n  Army Corps issued orders to the advance guard to cross the Sauer with\r\n  four battalions at =Wörth= and =Spachbach= (1500 m. apart) and to\r\n  occupy Wörth and the heights beyond, where the entire corps of Mac\r\n  Mahon was in position.[368]\r\n\r\n    [368] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 320.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the attacking troops, under cover of the advance guard,\r\ninto a preparatory position, is made in such a manner that units are\r\nopposite their objectives when the subsequent forward movement against\r\nthe enemy is begun.[369] This frequently requires a rearrangement of\r\nthe forces so that even an assailant who is numerically inferior may\r\nbe superior at the decisive point. A simultaneous attack from the\r\nfront and flanks requires reserves everywhere and is opposed to the\r\neconomical employment of the forces; it may easily lead to failure, and\r\nis justifiable only when the assailant is greatly superior in numbers\r\nor morale.\r\n\r\n    [369] The deployment of the 1st Infantry Brigade of the Guard, near\r\n  Ste. Marie aux Chênes, against St. Privat. _Der 18. August_ p. 408.\r\n\r\nA premature deployment impairs the leader’s influence on the course\r\nof the combat and makes it difficult to change the direction of the\r\nattack. Route columns, taking advantage of all available cover, will,\r\ntherefore, be retained as long as possible, and only subordinate units\r\npermitted to march directly toward their proper objectives, until the\r\nhostile fire compels a more extended deployment (development). The\r\npreparatory position is taken up in the last sheltered area in front\r\nof the hostile position, provided that that area is large enough to\r\naccommodate the attacking force when deployed for action, and to shield\r\nit from the observation and the fire of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn country generally devoid of cover, infantry will have to be placed\r\nin a preparatory position when three kilometers or more from the enemy,\r\neven when the latter’s artillery will in all probability be neutralized\r\nby our own.\r\n\r\n“In order to ensure the concerted advance of the various units into the\r\npreparatory position, it is advisable, especially in close country,\r\nto have them move from one covered position to another. If this is\r\ndone, units whose march was favored by the nature of the ground, will\r\nnot arrive prematurely within dangerous proximity of the enemy, while\r\nothers who had farther to go, or whose advance was difficult, are\r\nstill a considerable distance to the rear. The leader should make his\r\ndispositions so that no loss of time will result from this advance from\r\none covered position to another.” (Par. 369 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nWhere large forces are concerned, the attack on a position carefully\r\nprepared for defense will consume several days, the assailant placing\r\nhis artillery in position on the first day and reconnoitering under\r\ncover of infantry, which is pushed to the front.[370] The troops of\r\nthe first line are pushed forward far enough before daylight so that\r\nthey can intrench under cover of darkness and open fire at dawn.\r\nThis will be more difficult to accomplish when covering troops or\r\nadvanced positions are located in front of the hostile position. If the\r\nassailant has succeeded, on the previous day, in driving these troops\r\nback upon the main position, an advance to within effective range may\r\nbe made during the night in order that the fire fight may be opened on\r\nthe succeeding day. Although the chance of taking the enemy by surprise\r\nis eliminated in such a case, the advantage of having diminished the\r\ndistance that will have to be crossed under fire remains.[371]\r\n\r\n    [370] The attack on fortified positions is discussed in detail\r\n  in _Taktik_, V, p. 237, et seq., as It depends upon the closest\r\n  cooperation of field artillery, foot artillery, infantry and pioneers.\r\n\r\n    [371] The engagement at Belmont, on Nov. 22nd, 1899, furnishes an\r\n  interesting example of unforeseen friction. The advance, in this\r\n  instance, was made during the night from a point 8 km. from the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find shelter for the rearward echelons, which must\r\nbe kept in readiness in very close proximity to the leading line. These\r\nrear echelons must either be intrenched or at least sheltered by masks.\r\nGeneral actions should be avoided at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE COÖPERATION OF INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY IN BATTLE.\r\n\r\nUpon completion of the concentration for action (development), the\r\ninfantry has to advance within the zone of effective infantry fire. In\r\ndoing this the infantry must either pass by or through the artillery\r\nwhich is already engaged.[372]\r\n\r\n    [372] See p. 316, et seq.\r\n\r\nDuring the Russo-Japanese war, the effect of shrapnel, in spite of the\r\nmediocre matériel and the lack of shields, forced the artillery of both\r\nbelligerents to seek shelter on the reverse slope of heights. When this\r\nwas neglected and when batteries went into position in the open, within\r\neffective range, they were quickly silenced. The fear of shrapnel\r\ncaused both sides to advance cautiously, to relinquish all close order\r\nformations at an early moment, and to employ the spade extensively.\r\nThis alone was evidence of the fact that the artillery had accomplished\r\na good deal. Moreover, it was not altogether accident that the first\r\nfew of the larger Japanese night attacks occurred coincidentally with\r\nthe appearance of Russian artillery matériel, which was superior both\r\nas regards numbers and power. The new German I. D. R. (par. 444), in\r\ncontrast with the previous edition (II, par. 82). prescribe that the\r\ninfantry attack should not be postponed until a superiority of fire\r\nhas been gained. Thus, the regulations draw logical conclusions from\r\nthe modern armament and seek to avoid useless bombardments of hostile\r\npositions (such, for instance, as the Russians indulged in at Plevna\r\nand the British in South Africa).\r\n\r\n“_The principal duty of field artillery is to support the infantry\r\nin the most effective manner. Its duties are inseparably connected\r\nwith those of the infantry. It should, on principle, always fight the\r\ntargets that are most dangerous for its infantry._” (Par. 364 German F.\r\nA. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThe German Field Artillery Drill Regulations prescribe that the guns\r\nshould fire over the heads of the advancing infantry (par. 375), and\r\nthat single batteries should accompany the infantry attack to within\r\nclose range of the enemy (par. 471). When an assault is to be made, the\r\ninfantry expects the artillery to direct its fire against the point of\r\nattack until immediately before the assault begins.\r\n\r\n“But our infantry should never be obliged to dispense with the support\r\nof artillery. The gun shields afford considerable protection, even at\r\nthe short ranges. _At the decisive moment the artillery should not\r\nshrink even from the heaviest infantry fire._” (Par. 369 German F. A.\r\nD. R.).\r\n\r\n“In selecting an objective, it is essential for the artillery to\r\nconsider whether, by fighting it, the infantry will be effectively\r\nsupported. Whether the hostile infantry or artillery is chosen as\r\nan objective will depend upon the situation. As a rule, the hostile\r\nartillery will be the proper objective for our artillery during the\r\npreparatory stage of the action. As the distance between the opposing\r\ninfantry forces decreases, it will become more and more necessary for\r\nthe artillery to devote itself to the hostile infantry.” (Par. 432\r\nGerman F. A. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIf the artillery is equipped with shielded guns, it can devote itself\r\nfor some time to the most important target without regard to the\r\nhostile artillery, contenting itself with merely occupying the latter’s\r\nattention. (Par. 469 German F. A. D. R.). To silence artillery in a\r\nconcealed position requires curved fire and a good deal of ammunition;\r\nbut, on the other hand, artillery so posted cannot fire upon advancing\r\nskirmishers.[373] Therefore, the advancing skirmishers of the assailant\r\nshould force the hostile artillery to leave its cover and to expose\r\nitself to the attacker’s artillery. (Pars. 330 and 496 German F. A. D.\r\nR.).\r\n\r\n    [373] This is partly due to the fact that fire cannot be adjusted\r\n  quickly enough, and that it is difficult to follow moving targets.\r\n  Besides, when the targets are small and numerous, they are difficult\r\n  to hit.\r\n\r\nThe result of this procedure will be that the artillery of both sides\r\nwill engage each other’s attention with only a small part of their\r\nguns, and concentrate the remainder on the hostile infantry. It is\r\nobvious that the infantry will very soon demand of its artillery in\r\ndefinite terms that it should first annihilate the hostile artillery\r\nbefore the infantry can think of continuing the attack.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the German regulations in regard to the fusion of\r\nactivities of infantry and artillery mark an entirely new departure.\r\nThe commencement of the infantry attack is accordingly no longer\r\ndependent upon the result of the artillery combat; on the contrary,\r\nboth combats are of equal importance and proceed along parallel lines;\r\nthe only danger is that the infantry may make a headlong rush to the\r\nfront before a superiority of fire has been gained.\r\n\r\n  Confidential British instructions, dealing with the lessons learned\r\n  by the Japanese in Manchuria, contain the following: “Intrenched\r\n  artillery can be permanently silenced only under very exceptional\r\n  circumstances, as it will withdraw its personnel temporarily, as\r\n  soon as the hostile fire becomes too hot, and resume its fire again\r\n  when that of the enemy abates. The infantry attack should therefore\r\n  be launched without awaiting the result of the artillery combat, but\r\n  the infantry must insist upon the artillery completely engaging the\r\n  attention of the hostile guns during the advance. Another reason for\r\n  not awaiting the outcome of the artillery combat, lies in the great\r\n  frontage of battle lines. The unsuccessful attack made by a division\r\n  will then frequently cause the neighboring unit to make an immediate\r\n  attack.”\r\n\r\n  =Austria= (1904). “The artillery must be given an opportunity and the\r\n  necessary time for effectively preparing the infantry attack. So long\r\n  as the artillery engaged with the hostile batteries has not achieved\r\n  a noticeable success, or is not at least neutralizing the hostile\r\n  artillery, the infantry attack remains a difficult undertaking.”\r\n\r\n  =France.= The artillery during the preparatory stage of an action:\r\n  The artillery should endeavor to silence the hostile artillery as\r\n  quickly as possible, without employing more guns than are absolutely\r\n  necessary. The commander should give the order for the attack only\r\n  when the preparation is considered sufficient.\r\n\r\n  =England.= The regulations emphasize the necessity of pushing\r\n  infantry forward, and of supporting that infantry energetically, so\r\n  as to compel the defender to expose himself. “As soon as the hostile\r\n  batteries have been sufficiently silenced, or the infantry advances\r\n  to the attack, the fire is directed upon the point of attack in order\r\n  to prepare and to cover the assault.”\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= The regulations state that artillery is a supporting arm\r\n  for infantry. “If the hostile artillery discloses its position from\r\n  the start by employing direct fire against the assailant’s artillery\r\n  or infantry, the attacker’s batteries endeavor to silence it or to\r\n  draw its fire upon themselves, in order to facilitate the deployment\r\n  of their own infantry. If, on the other hand, the hostile artillery\r\n  remains concealed for the purpose of saving its fire for the infantry\r\n  when the latter offers a favorable target upon arriving within\r\n  effective range, then it would seem advisable for the artillery of\r\n  the assailant not to open fire at all, or to open fire only with\r\n  enough guns to cope with the available targets. The assailant’s\r\n  artillery brings the fire of all its batteries into play when the\r\n  defender’s artillery is compelled to come into action in order to\r\n  support its own infantry against the advance of the attacker’s\r\n  infantry.”\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of providing for coöperation between infantry and\r\nartillery are due to the impossibility of distinguishing at all times\r\nwith certainty between friend and foe (assaulting guidons),[374]\r\nsince the elimination of powder smoke and the adoption of neutral\r\ntinted uniforms; and, further, to the circumstance that, while we have\r\na signal for increasing the range of the artillery (g.g.g.), we have\r\nnone for indicating that the fire is to be concentrated upon certain\r\npoints. “Uninterrupted communication with the fighting line in front\r\nmust be provided for. For this purpose officers, who report by signal\r\nor by telephone, should be sent forward. These officers are primarily\r\nto ascertain how close their own firing line is to the enemy, in order\r\nthat the artillery may keep up its fire as long as possible.” (Par. 376\r\nGerman F. A. D. R.). In England, it has been suggested to indicate the\r\npoint upon which fire is to be concentrated, by the colored ball of\r\nsmoke of a special projectile. It requires strict attention on the part\r\nof the infantry to make its work harmonize with that of the artillery.\r\nEvery opportunity, for example, when the hostile infantry is forced\r\nunder cover by a burst of fire, should be utilized for advancing. This\r\nis particularly emphasized in France. The defender is to be blinded by\r\na hailstorm of fragments. “Every rafale of the artillery will either\r\ncause the most advanced line to make a rush, or the troops of the rear\r\nline to come up to the firing line in order to reinforce it or to carry\r\nit forward as much as possible. Thus the rafale becomes a veritable\r\nshield for the infantry (_véritable bouclier de l’infanterie_).”\r\nLANGLOIS.\r\n\r\n    [374] During the attack on the Waterberg, on August 11th, 1904, the\r\n  various units were ordered to carry, on their outer flanks, flags\r\n  attached to long poles. These flags were white in Estorffs, red in\r\n  v.d. Heyde’s, blue in Müller’s, and green in Deimling’s detachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE POINT OF ATTACK.[375]\r\n\r\n    [375] See _Taktik_, V, p. 138.\r\n\r\nThe reconnoitering troops are charged with the duty of ascertaining\r\nthe parts of the hostile position which can be approached under cover,\r\nwhich are weaker than the others (frequently true of the flanks),[376]\r\nor which can be enfiladed. The attack will usually be directed\r\nagainst the weakest point in the hostile position, or that on which\r\nthe greatest volume of fire can be concentrated from enfilading or\r\ncommanding positions. At all other points of the battlefield, the\r\nassailant will endeavor to deceive the opponent, with weak forces, as\r\nto his true intentions, but, at the decisive point, he should launch\r\nsuperior numbers. The French regulations contend that such weak points\r\nwill only become apparent during the course of the fight, and therefore\r\nseparate the troops into a preparatory and a decisive combat group.\r\n\r\n    [376] Example: The right flank of the French position at Wörth, and\r\n  at Roncourt (St. Privat).\r\n\r\nThe desire to strike the weakest point in the enemy’s line causes\r\nthe decisive blow to be directed against a flank, and the numerical\r\nsuperiority requisite for gaining the superiority of fire, leads to\r\n\r\n\r\n6. ENVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n(Pars. 392-396 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThe desire of the attacker to put a superior number of rifles into the\r\nfight, in order to gain a superiority of fire more quickly, naturally\r\nleads to an extension of the firing line and to an overlapping of the\r\ndefender’s line. The advantage of overlapping the enemy’s line lies in\r\nthe fact that part of the line attacked is exposed to both frontal and\r\noblique fire. The effect of this oblique fire is increased by bending\r\nthe wing of the attacking line toward the enemy. If the attacking line\r\nsucceeds in pushing its firing line so far forward that not only the\r\nhostile wing but also the hostile flank is struck, an envelopment is\r\nbrought about with the result that the lines of fire of the assailant\r\ncross each other within the hostile position. If the defender refuses a\r\nwing, portions of his line may be enfiladed. This will cause such heavy\r\nlosses that the defender will begin to succumb first at the salient\r\npoint of his line. A further advantage is gained by a pressure on the\r\nenemy’s line of retreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPure frontal attacks offer little prospect of success;[377] they may\r\nperhaps force the enemy back, but they cannot annihilate him.\r\n\r\n    [377] It is only necessary to invite attention to the first attacks\r\n  made by the Prussian Guard against St. Privat, and to the attack made\r\n  by the 72nd, 40th and 11th Infantry Regiments against the height\r\n  of Maison Blanche south of Rezonville, on August 16th, 1870. KUNZ,\r\n  _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 8-10, p. 128.\r\n\r\nFor carrying out the attack itself, it is immaterial whether the\r\ncommander launches it against the hostile front or a hostile flank;\r\nindividual companies, battalions, and, in large units, regiments,\r\nfinally make a frontal attack anyway. The fear of the front of the\r\nenemy should not lead the enveloping force to attempt to execute\r\nanother enveloping movement when it encounters a newly formed front.\r\nSurprise is, to a certain extent, essential to the success of a flank\r\nattack.[378] The troops holding the enemy in front [secondary attack]\r\nmust, therefore, hold him in such a manner as to keep him in ignorance\r\nabout the true point of attack, must so engage his attention that he\r\nwill finally place the bulk of his force into the frontal action. If\r\nthis does not occur, the opponent will soon distinguish sham from\r\nreality and will not oppose a weak, inactive containing force with\r\nmore troops than are absolutely necessary. In this connection, compare\r\nthe conduct of the 1st Army at Königgrätz and of the Prussian Vth Army\r\nCorps at Wörth with the vacillating action of the Russian IIIrd and\r\nIst Armies at Sandepu.[379] So long as the enemy is not firmly held\r\nin front, he will be able to evade an envelopment by withdrawing. The\r\ncombats of the Boers in the Orange Free State furnish numerous examples\r\nof this fact. The Austrian regulations have very properly coined the\r\nterm “attack on two fronts”, which better indicates the task of both\r\nparts of an attacking force.\r\n\r\n    [378] The attack of the Guard at Chlum (Königgrätz).

The advantages offered by an\r\nenveloping movement must not lead to holding the enemy once and for\r\nall in front, while the main attack is directed against his flank. A\r\nfrontal attack made in conjunction with a threatening demonstration\r\nagainst the hostile flank frequently offers far greater prospects\r\nof success.[380] If a superiority is to be employed to advantage,\r\nan envelopment must be made; all objections advanced against the\r\n“enveloping craze” are disposed of by this statement.[381] “A condition\r\nprecedent to an envelopment is that the enemy be held in front. For\r\nthis purpose a determined demonstration is most effective.” (Par. 392\r\nGerman I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [380] The attack on Flanville, on September 1st, 1870, is an\r\n  instructive example. KUNZ, _Noisseville_, p. 87. _Gen. St. W._, II.\r\n  p. 1407.\r\n\r\n    [381] V. D. GOLTZ, _Das Volk in Waffen_, pp. 328 and 332. BLUME,\r\n  _Strategie_, p. 170. MECKEL, _Truppenführung_, p. 221.\r\n\r\nThe risks involved in an envelopment must not be\r\noverlooked--overextension and dispersion of the troops;[382] the\r\npossibility that the troops fighting in front and those fighting on the\r\nflank, separated from each other, may be defeated in detail, whether\r\nthis be brought about by the defender assuming the offensive, or by\r\nthe force holding the enemy in front allowing itself to be enticed\r\ninto making a premature advance and suffering a defeat before the\r\nenvelopment has a chance to become effective.\r\n\r\n    [382] The attack made by François’ Brigade during the battle of\r\n  Spicheren. _Gen. St. W._, I. p. 318. Between 12 and 1 o’clock, this\r\n  brigade covered a front of 4000 m. See p. 262, supra.\r\n\r\n“The envelopment is effected in the simplest manner if the forces\r\ndesignated for this task, when still at a distance from the enemy, are\r\ngiven a march direction that will bring them against the hostile flank.\r\n\r\n“When initiated during the development for action or when carried out\r\nby retained reserves, the envelopment is much more difficult.” (Par.\r\n393 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIn the last-mentioned case it may happen that the force detailed to\r\nmake the flank attack strikes the enemy’s front instead of his flank.\r\nThe same is true of attempts to envelop with parts of the infantry of\r\nthe first line that are already deployed, perhaps already engaged,\r\nwhen the terrain is not specially favorable for such a movement. Such\r\nmovements may, in special cases, be carried out at night. (Enveloping\r\nmovements of the divisions of the Japanese IIIrd Army at Mukden). As a\r\nrule, this brings about only an overlapping and flanking of the parts\r\nof the hostile position next adjacent to the wing making the movement,\r\nbut does not produce a concentric effect on the hostile flank. Yet,\r\neven weak detachments that reach positions from which they are able to\r\nenfilade the enemy, facilitate the advance to the front.\r\n\r\nIn starting an enveloping movement when at a considerable distance\r\nfrom the enemy, the force which is to make it, is directed upon a\r\npoint located in rear of the hostile position, approximately where\r\nhis reserves are presumed to be. If then the fighting line is further\r\nextended toward the outer flank, the assailant avoids facing the\r\nhostile front directly, and will almost invariably have a start over\r\nthe defender in extending the threatened wing. The troops still in the\r\nact of withdrawing from the route column naturally take charge of the\r\nprotection of the flanks.[383]\r\n\r\n    [383] Compare the deployment for action of the 1st Guard Division\r\n  at Königgrätz with that of the 4th Japanese Division at Wafangu. In\r\n  the last-mentioned case, the leading (10th) brigade was launched\r\n  in a very skillful flank attack; the second brigade took charge of\r\n  protecting the flank.\r\n\r\nIf a flank march in front of the enemy should become necessary, it can\r\nbe undertaken with sufficient safety only when proper preparations\r\nhave been made--distribution in depth, shortening of route columns,\r\ndue regard being had to protection of the front and flanks--to permit\r\na deployment of the force at the right moment and in a suitable\r\nformation toward the hostile side.[384] Within effective range of the\r\nenemy, such a movement by the flank can be carried out only when cover\r\nis available, otherwise the hostile fire will very quickly force the\r\ntroops making the flank march to face to the front.[385]\r\n\r\n    [384] V. SCHLICHTING. _Taktische und strategische Grundsätze_,\r\n  I, p. 90, et seq. The attack of the six Brandenburg battalions\r\n  against the Hill of Forbach (Spicheren) is especially instructive\r\n  in this connection. The attacking force was threatened by hostile\r\n  troops lodged in the Stiring Wald. The first deployment caused the\r\n  attacking force to face toward the front of the French position.\r\n  As soon as this was noticed, the skirmishers were withdrawn in\r\n  order to be pushed into the fight again at another place. GERNIER,\r\n  _Einmarschkämpfe_, p. 184.\r\n\r\n    [385] Look up the conduct of the 22nd Infantry Division at\r\n  Villermain-Cravant, on December 8th, 1870. It is indeed true that a\r\n  violent snow storm and thick weather made it possible for this force\r\n  to disengage itself from the enemy and to join the 1st Bavarian Army\r\n  Corps at Cravant.\r\n\r\n  The attempt of the 16th Infantry Division to envelop the French\r\n  position on the =Hallue=[386]: The 30th Brigade used the road leading\r\n  along the hostile front from Querrieux to Frechencourt, for its\r\n  movement. The leading regiment of the brigade, the 28th Infantry,\r\n  on debouching from Querrieux, immediately faced toward the annoying\r\n  flanking fire and endeavored to advance in the face of it, while the\r\n  brigade commander, energetically carrying out the orders given him,\r\n  led the 68th Infantry toward Frechencourt, thus forestalling several\r\n  French battalions that were hurrying up from the east. The village\r\n  was occupied and held by the 68th Infantry, but a frontal offensive\r\n  movement against the hostile main position could not be carried out\r\n  from here either, in spite of the inferiority of the French troops.\r\n\r\n    [386] V. MALACHOWSKI, _Frontalschlacht und Flügelschlacht_, p.\r\n  24, et seq. KUNZ, _Nordarmee_, I, p. 134, et seq. In regard to the\r\n  conduct of the 15th Infantry Division, which was to hold the enemy in\r\n  front and which advanced prematurely before the enveloping movement\r\n  of the 16th Division had become effective, consult p. 282 supra, and\r\n  _Taktik_, V. p. 163.\r\n\r\nWhether an enveloping force can be sent into action at once without\r\nbeing first placed in a preparatory position[387] or whether it should\r\nfirst be concentrated, depends upon the situation of the troops engaged\r\nin front with the enemy (the necessity of relieving the pressure on\r\nthe Ist Army engaged in front with the enemy at Königgrätz), and upon\r\nthe counter-measures taken by the enemy. If the assailant encounters\r\na newly formed front, it would be a mistake for him to attack\r\nsuccessively with the different units.\r\n\r\n    [387] According to the opinion of General V. SCHLICHTING, a\r\n  preparatory position should be taken up. _Taktische und strategische\r\n  Grundsätze_, III, pp. 133 and 154, et seq. See _Taktik_, V, p. 174.\r\n\r\nWhether the troops holding the enemy in front participate in the\r\nassault during an enveloping movement, depends upon circumstances. They\r\nmay frequently better ensure the success of the attack by delivering an\r\nenfilading fire than by advancing. The commander should, at any rate,\r\nnot lose sight of this advantage. If both groups (the enveloping and\r\nthe holding group) advance to the decisive attack, they should do so\r\nsimultaneously. The group holding the enemy in front must resist the\r\ntemptation of moving to the front before the envelopment can become\r\neffective.[388]\r\n\r\n    [388] Consult _Der 18. August_, pp. 377, 561 and 590. In regard to\r\n  the attack made by the Guard and the Saxons and the premature attack\r\n  made by the Guard at St Privat.\r\n\r\n  The attack on =Ste. Marie aux Chênes=, on August 18th, 1870,[389] and\r\n  that made by the 37th Infantry Brigade on =Ladon=[390] are models\r\n  worthy of imitation. “The brigade commander personally directed\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel v. Hagen (commanding the troops holding the enemy\r\n  in front) to have the signal ‘forward double time’ sounded as soon\r\n  as he could see the skirmishers of the 78th Infantry coming over the\r\n  heights to the right front.”\r\n\r\n    [389] The 1st Infantry Division of the Guard received orders “to\r\n  form for attack against St. Privat, but not to attack that village\r\n  before the expected arrival of the Saxon Corps.” _Der 18. August_,\r\n  pp. 167 and 288.\r\n\r\n    [390] HÖNIG, _Gefechtsbilder_, III, pp. 58 and 49.\r\n\r\n  At =Gorni Dubniac=, on October 30th, 1877, the scheme of designating\r\n  the moment for attack by means of artillery salvos, failed. During\r\n  the attack on =Scheinovo=, on January 9th, 1878, the simultaneous\r\n  advance of Prince Mirski’s troops was regulated by the clock.\r\n\r\nIf the attacker desires to deliver an effective blow against the\r\nenemy’s flank, _a considerable interval must be left between the troops\r\ncharged with the holding attack_ [secondary attack] _and those detailed\r\nto make the flank attack_, when the envelopment is initiated. (Par. 393\r\nGerman I. D. R.). The width of this gap is increased to a seemingly\r\ndangerous degree by the range of modern weapons, but real danger is not\r\nto be apprehended as a counter-attack of the defender exposes both of\r\nhis flanks to an enveloping attack. If the enveloping group continues\r\nto advance, that advance in itself will very soon set a limit to the\r\nenemy’s counter-attack. The seemingly dangerous gap in the line, at\r\nthe commencement of an action, is closed more and more as the enemy is\r\napproached. Nevertheless, this gap may induce a cautious leader to draw\r\nthe enveloping group closer to the frontal group, thereby impairing\r\nthe effectiveness of the envelopment. The flanking groups accomplish\r\nthe best results, but in following up tactical objectives, they should\r\nnever lose sight of the annihilation of the enemy. The difficulty of\r\ncoördinating the action of the separated parts of the line is greater\r\nthan the danger to be apprehended from a hostile counter-attack against\r\nthe frontal group. As a rule, the entry of the enveloping group into\r\naction will be the signal for a general attack. The effectiveness of\r\nthe enveloping attack is proportional to the energy with which it is\r\nmade, but the danger to be apprehended from a hostile counter-attack\r\nincreases in the same ratio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisions of Various Regulations.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= When possible, the reserve is to be designated to make the\r\n  enveloping movement. (Par. 407 Austrian I. D. R.). When practicable,\r\n  a part of the reserve is employed from the start for the envelopment,\r\n  and, under certain circumstances, also for the purpose of gaining\r\n  positions from which an enfilade fire can be delivered, and for\r\n  supporting the advance of the frontal attack. The group holding\r\n  the enemy in front may at first fight a purely defensive action to\r\n  prevent a hostile counter-attack, to screen our own dispositions, and\r\n  finally, by means of a fire fight at effective ranges, to hold the\r\n  hostile troops in their position.\r\n\r\n  =France.= The envelopment is occasionally mentioned in the\r\n  regulations (for example in pars. 290, 301 and 302). The Field\r\n  Service Regulations, in discussing the attack, whose different stages\r\n  may vary in length depending upon the intentions of the commander,\r\n  state, however, that the attacker “may assail a wing or a flank of\r\n  the enemy, with superior forces, for the purpose of annihilating him.”\r\n\r\n  =England.= The importance of flank attacks, even those in which\r\n  the defender is subdued by the flanking fire of mounted troops, is\r\n  specially mentioned, but, in this connection, it is emphasized that\r\n  it is immaterial whether the attack is finally directed against\r\n  the front or a flank of the enemy. The holding attack is to be\r\n  carried out with energy in front to prevent the enemy from drawing\r\n  reinforcements to other points.\r\n\r\n  =Italy.= While the regulations of 1891 still unqualifiedly\r\n  acknowledged that any frontal attack might succeed, the regulations\r\n  of 1903 called attention to the importance of the envelopment,\r\n  without denying “that the frontal attack might be the decisive one.”\r\n  Surprise is an advantageous factor for success, and for this reason,\r\n  even covering troops, for example, may have to be dispensed with on\r\n  the march.\r\n\r\n  If a force desires to take the enemy by surprise, it must carefully\r\n  take advantage of the ground. The surprise may be made more complete,\r\n  if the accompanying frontal attack is energetically pushed. On the\r\n  other hand, considerations for the troops in the holding attack, set\r\n  a limit to the extension of the flanking movement. The fire power of\r\n  the troops in the holding attack must not be exhausted, or the troops\r\n  themselves defeated by a hostile counter-attack, before the moment of\r\n  the general advance arrives. They must pay the strictest attention to\r\n  the course of events on the opponent’s side; if the enemy retires, or\r\n  shifts parts of his force in order to meet a flank attack, the troops\r\n  in the holding attack must act with energy. If such signs are not\r\n  apparent, a frontal advance will, as a rule, be proper only when the\r\n  pressure of the flank attack makes itself felt on the enemy’s line.\r\n  This is the only way in which “simultaneous action by both attacks\r\n  may be ensured, and this is of decisive importance to the successful\r\n  issue of the combat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n7. REMOVAL OF PACKS.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable for infantry to remove packs for an attack; such\r\ntremendous physical exertions await the troops that everything ought\r\nto be done to reduce the load carried by the individual man.[391] “As\r\nsoon as it becomes doubtful whether the troops will be able to perform\r\nthe task assigned them in action without such relief, all independent\r\ncommanders, and, in organizations larger than a regiment, commanders\r\nof regiments and of higher units, have authority to order the men to\r\nremove their packs. In issuing such an order they should bear in mind\r\nthe disadvantages which may result from leaving the packs behind. When\r\nknapsacks are removed, the ammunition and iron rations should be taken\r\nfrom them. Overcoats, cooking utensils, canteens, bread bags, and\r\nintrenching tools remain on the men.” (Par. 301 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [391] Examples from military history in _Militär-Wochenblatt_,\r\n  1902, No. 32.\r\n\r\nAccording to the French Manual of Field Engineering, the skirmishers,\r\nespecially when intrenching, may utilize the knapsack as cover.\r\n\r\nIn a defeat knapsacks will frequently be lost. Thus the Russians,\r\nafter the second battle of Plevna, and Frossard’s Corps, after the\r\nbattle of Spicheren, lost their knapsacks with camp equipment and iron\r\nrations, and, in consequence thereof, suffered great hardships during\r\nthe succeeding days. On the other hand, during their retreat, the\r\n43rd, 44th and 45th Infantry Regiments of the Ist Army Corps managed\r\nto recover without trouble the packs which they had removed before\r\nentering the battle of Trautenau.\r\n\r\n  The infantry of the Xth Army Corps had left its knapsacks behind\r\n  on August 8th, 1870, and did not get them again until the early\r\n  part of September. The knapsacks were not hauled on wagons after\r\n  the organizations, but were left at the railroad station of St.\r\n  Ingbert. On August 6th, 1870, the Würtemberg Field Brigade had left\r\n  its knapsacks in a bivouac near Reimersweiler at the risk of never\r\n  seeing them again. Among other reasons, General v. d. Tann considered\r\n  it impossible for the 2nd Bavarian Division to advance beyond Wörth,\r\n  because the organizations might perhaps thereby have been separated\r\n  for several days from their baggage, which they had left behind\r\n  between Preuschdorf and Görsdorf.\r\n\r\nWhen knapsacks are removed, a detachment will have to be left behind\r\nto guard them, otherwise they may be robbed of their contents.[392]\r\nThe troops always consider the trip to the rear to get the baggage\r\na special hardship; wagons will very rarely be available for this\r\npurpose, as after great battles all the wagons in the entire\r\nneighborhood will be requisitioned for transporting the wounded, and as\r\nsupply wagons will, as a rule, not be at hand.\r\n\r\n    [392] This was neglected by the 20th and 35th Infantries, on August\r\n  16th, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE EMPLOYMENT OF MACHINE GUNS.\r\n\r\nIn an attack upon a defensive position which is held in force, machine\r\ngun batteries will generally be held in rear for the time being. They\r\nform a mobile reserve in the hands of the commander-in-chief, who may\r\nemploy it for quickly reinforcing threatened points, for exerting a\r\npressure upon the wings and flanks of the enemy, and for preparing the\r\nassault. Machine gun companies, either broken up into platoons or not,\r\nas the case may be, endeavor to reach positions from which they can\r\nfacilitate the advance of their infantry.\r\n\r\nIt is especially advantageous if the fire that is directed upon the\r\npoint where the hostile position is to be penetrated, comes from a\r\nposition permitting a good view, or from an oblique direction, because\r\nthe fire will not have to be discontinued even when the infantry\r\ncontinues its advance or moves to the assault. If such a position,\r\npermitting the greatest fire effect, is reached (at about 800 m. or\r\nless from the hostile position) any further advance of the machine guns\r\nis faulty, because it interrupts the fire and necessitates fresh laying\r\nand adjustment.\r\n\r\nUpon the victorious termination of a fight, the machine guns should\r\nparticipate in the first stages of the pursuit by making an extended\r\nuse of their fire. They hurry forward into the captured position, as\r\nsoon as it is apparent that the victory has been gained, in order to\r\nsupport the infantry in holding the position, to cover the infantry\r\nwhile it is re-forming, and to reduce the last vestige of the enemy’s\r\nresistance. If the attack fails the machine guns cover the retiring\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. THE CONDUCT OF THE ATTACK.\r\n\r\nIn an infantry attack, the art of minor troop leading consists of\r\npushing a firing line, superior to the enemy, to the strip of ground\r\nfrom which the power of our rifle can be utilized to the best advantage\r\nfor vanquishing the enemy; secondly, of bringing up supports, without\r\nexposing them to unnecessary losses, so that they will be promptly\r\navailable in case of need. The preparations which the enemy has\r\nmade for attaining the maximum fire power (by intrenching, placing\r\nammunition in readiness, and by ascertaining ranges) must be offset\r\nby employing a superior number of rifles. The commander who brings a\r\ngreater number of rifles into action than his opponent, may count on\r\ngaining a superiority of fire quickly and with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe task of higher troop leading consists of simultaneously launching\r\nthe troops against the common objective.\r\n\r\nThe effect of modern projectiles requires that, on open ground, the\r\nfirst deployment be made when 4000-5000 m. from the enemy. The best\r\nscheme would be to advance, without halting, to within decisive short\r\nrange of the defender, and then to open fire, but, as previously\r\nstated, the defender should endeavor to prevent the assailant from ever\r\nreaching these ranges. This design of the defender must be frustrated;\r\nif artillery is unable to accomplish this, machine guns or a part of\r\nthe infantry must enter the fight; but all parts of the force not\r\nrequired for this fire fight at medium ranges should continue their\r\nmovement without interruption.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult task that infantry may be called upon to perform\r\nconsists of advancing over an open plain, in the face of unsubdued\r\nartillery, when the situation does not permit night or the effect of an\r\nenvelopment to be awaited.\r\n\r\nThe first deployment as skirmishers is made for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the advancing troops against surprise. Frequently, a squad\r\nor a section per company will suffice for this purpose, but these units\r\nshould cover the entire front available for the organization to which\r\nthey belong. A uniform and simultaneous advance along the whole line\r\nis impossible however, on account of the diversity of the ground at\r\nvarious points. When cover is available, skirmish lines may be formed\r\nquickly and pushed forward as entities, but when cover is lacking,\r\nfiring lines may have to be deployed slowly and piecemeal. The unit\r\nthat has pushed farthest to the front must facilitate with its fire the\r\nadvance of those who have encountered greater obstacles in advancing.\r\n\r\nLong, dense firing lines and the supports following them are exposed\r\nto such heavy losses in open country, even at long ranges, that their\r\nadvance will soon hesitate. Moreover, the defender will only fire\r\non targets whose size and density promise a great number of hits.\r\nTherefore, the assailant should endeavor to lead his infantry forward\r\nin loose, disconnected skirmish lines, which are difficult for the\r\nenemy to hit. As a rule, the assailant should not open fire until\r\nafter he has been reinforced and has sufficient fire power available.\r\n(Par. 334 German I. D. R.). The situation in which these thin firing\r\nlines are placed is by no means a favorable one, as the defender will\r\nconcentrate his fire on the points where the assailant seems to be\r\nfilling up his line “for the purpose of overwhelming the defender\r\npermanently by a superiority of fire.” (Par. 413 German I. D. R.). The\r\nskirmishers will then quite naturally open fire for the purpose of\r\ninterfering with the cool delivery of the defender’s fire.\r\n\r\nSuch a piecemeal, almost independent advance, during which the effect\r\nof the accustomed word of command is considerably reduced and control\r\nand supervision of the individual skirmisher is impossible, presupposes\r\nthat the troops are well-drilled, individually trained, and, above all,\r\nintelligent. Attention must also be called to the fact that the firing\r\nline can offer but a weak resistance to an enemy advancing unexpectedly\r\nin force. But, in spite of these drawbacks, this mode of advance\r\nhas its advantages for crossing a plain devoid of cover. It permits\r\nfavorable fire positions to be reached with greater safety, especially\r\nif these positions can be picked out with the aid of field glasses,\r\nthan would be the case if dense skirmish lines were led forward\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the infantry under hostile fire, over open ground, may\r\naccordingly be conducted--\r\n\r\n1. At a walk, by long rushes made by strong units (by platoons at\r\nleast), supported by powerful artillery fire or by the fire of a\r\nmachine gun battery or a detachment of skirmishers posted in a\r\nfavorable position;\r\n\r\n2. By shorter rushes made by smaller units (“proper only when\r\nconditions demand it”);\r\n\r\n3. By crawling, or, in exceptional cases (for example in passing\r\nthrough fields of standing grain), by employing\r\n\r\n4. Fire while in motion.\r\n\r\nThe fire fight at long ranges and near the extreme limit of mid ranges\r\nis only a means for the purpose of reaching the decisive battle ranges,\r\nand of interfering with the undisturbed delivery of the enemy’s fire.\r\nFire must be opened at as late a moment as possible. Our firing line\r\nshould in any case be strong enough, upon entering the zone of mid\r\nranges, to reply effectively to the enemy’s fire. Experience has shown\r\nthat an assailant who opens fire at “long” ranges rarely reaches short\r\nranges. (See p. 149 supra).\r\n\r\nThe distances at which the echelons in rear follow the firing line\r\nshould be less (as laid down in the Italian and Russian regulations)\r\nthan the distance which separates the firing line of the attacker from\r\nthat of the defender. The distances may be increased without danger at\r\nthis stage of the combat, as the decision is not imminent, but on the\r\nflanks the supports will have to be brought up closer in order that an\r\nunexpected flank attack may be effectively opposed. All parts of the\r\nattacking force move--as long as possible at a walk--straight to the\r\nfront. Subordinate leaders, taking advantage of all available cover,\r\nshould endeavor to lead the supports skillfully after the firing line.\r\nThis requires that the ground to be crossed be reconnoitered. As a\r\nrule, a movement by the flank upon leaving cover is costlier than an\r\nadvance by squads or sections over open ground. Long lines make it\r\neasier for the hostile artillery to adjust and observe its fire, while,\r\nwhen a greater number of targets of smaller frontage is exposed, this\r\nis made more difficult. For this reason, supports are not led forward\r\nas entire units, but, on the contrary, they are broken up, and, under\r\ncertain circumstances, even disintegrated into smaller units. The\r\nunits following in rear remain as long as possible in close order\r\nformations, preferably in route columns. “Man is by nature exceedingly\r\ntimid. Soldiers, even those drawn from the educated classes, who were\r\nfully aware of the supreme importance of gaining the victory, broke\r\ndown on coming under fire. In close order the moral encouragement due\r\nto the proximity of superiors and comrades kept up their courage.”\r\n(Hessert).[393] Where cover is lacking, the supports will also have to\r\nbe deployed. Large units are broken up into platoons, which deploy and\r\nfollow each other at considerable distances.[394]\r\n\r\n    [393] “We are prone to place the individual on too high a pedestal,\r\n  and, in doing so, to ignore the psychological element of combat.”\r\n  Major-General Stieler.\r\n\r\n    [394] The losses sustained during the advance of the Russian\r\n  reserves at Plevna (11th September, 1877), and during the attack made\r\n  by the Guard on Gorni Dubniac, led to a spontaneous deployment on the\r\n  part of the reserves.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the enemy opens fire, platoon commanders must decide\r\nwhether or not it ought to be returned; but the closer one can get to\r\nthe enemy without firing a shot, the better. According to the German\r\nF. S. R. (par. 296), a prolonged, uninterrupted forward movement of\r\nskirmish lines in the open, at less than 1000 m. from the enemy, is\r\npossible only when supported by adequate fire. On the other hand, even\r\nskirmishers lying down suffer serious losses when 600 m. from the enemy.\r\n\r\nThus, at mid ranges, begins the actual, protracted fire fight, which,\r\nin the first place, is to make a further advance possible, and which,\r\nsubsequently, is to produce a superiority of fire. As taught by\r\nexperience, this cannot be accomplished from a single position, if the\r\nenemy is efficient.\r\n\r\n  A so-called “main firing position”, which was to be located 400-600\r\n  m. from the enemy, was frequently used during peace maneuvers for the\r\n  purpose of bringing cohesion and harmony into the attack. In making\r\n  use of such a position, the principal difficulty of every serious\r\n  infantry attack, that of crossing the space lying between the first\r\n  firing position and the assaulting position, was not appreciated.\r\n\r\n  =Austria.= (Par. 589 I. D. R.). “When conditions are very favorable,\r\n  it might be possible to choose the firing position in which the\r\n  decisive fire fight is to be begun, so close to the enemy that the\r\n  decision can be gained from it.”\r\n\r\nThe fire fight must be taken up by enough troops to make it\r\nimpossible for the defender, who holds his position strongly, to gain\r\na superiority of fire over some parts of the attacking force. The\r\nsupports will now move closer to the firing line, in order to fill\r\nevery gap in that line and to meet every attempt of the defender to\r\ngain the upper hand. The echelons of the second line which have not as\r\nyet been absorbed by the firing line, move up in a similar manner. If\r\nthe hostile fire abates, parts of the firing line should endeavor to\r\nget closer to the enemy; they are followed by the next adjoining units.\r\nAt this stage of the action the attacker will have to give up, to some\r\nextent, his distribution in depth.\r\n\r\nSuperiority of fire is an essential condition to victory. It is\r\nattained by better marksmanship, fire control and fire direction, by\r\ntaking advantage of cover, and by concentrating a powerful fire against\r\nthe decisive point. When the attacker’s troops are not well trained,\r\na greater number of rifles and more ammunition will be required to\r\ngain this superiority. Accordingly, the attacker will either make an\r\nenvelopment or employ fire of position. The attacker possesses a great\r\nadvantage, in that he does not need to gain a superiority of fire\r\nalong the whole front, but only at a single point. It suffices for\r\nhim to contain weak portions of the hostile front with suitable, well\r\nconcealed combat groups capable of quickly developing a powerful fire,\r\nwhile he masses the bulk of his forces against the decisive point. The\r\ndefender, who never knows where the decisive blow is going to fall,\r\nought not to allow himself to be enticed into occupying portions of his\r\nline more weakly than the rest.\r\n\r\nThe attainment of the superiority of fire requires time, and, in\r\naddition, coolness and patience on the part of the leaders. All the\r\nammunition that is expended in gaining this superiority is later\r\ncompensated for by fewer losses. The heavy losses sustained by the\r\nPrussian troops on the slopes of Point du Jour, on August 18th, 1870,\r\nmay be traced directly to the fact that the leaders did not know how to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nSuperiority of fire[395] is absolutely essential to the success of the\r\nattack. Any failure to appreciate this principle will lead to such\r\nheavy losses that even if the assailant were to reach the enemy’s\r\nposition, he would be too weak to gain the victory.[396]\r\n\r\n    [395] For the situation of the British Guard at Modder River\r\n  (28th November, 1890), see p. 182 supra. The Guards were closely\r\n  hugging the ground at a distance of 800 m. from the enemy. After\r\n  29 ammunition carriers had been shot at the very beginning of the\r\n  engagement, all attempts to carry orders or ammunition to the firing\r\n  line were abandoned. No attempts were made to relieve the pressure by\r\n  means of the fire of sharpshooters, by bringing up reinforcements, or\r\n  by gaining ground by crawling.\r\n\r\n    [396] “Battles are won by the superiority of fire.” FREDERICK THE\r\n  GREAT in his _Military Testament_, 1768.\r\n\r\nDuring the fluctuating fire fight, which lasts for hours, the attacker\r\nwill have succeeded in working forward little by little until he is\r\nclose to the enemy’s position. His superiority will now make itself\r\nfelt; the fire from the part of the hostile line that is to be\r\npenetrated will begin to abate; and, at first, single groups, then\r\nseveral, and finally, whole units of the enemy’s line will commence to\r\ncrumble away. The attacker should wait until this effect is produced\r\nbefore he begins the assault; if he does not do this, the attack is\r\nsure to fail.\r\n\r\n_Austria._ (Par. 590 I. D. R.). “The close approach of a long firing\r\nline to an enemy who occupies a good position, may well pass as a\r\nproof of the assailant’s superiority. Nevertheless, this does not,\r\nunder all circumstances, furnish assurance that a forward movement for\r\nthe purpose of penetrating the hostile position will now succeed; a\r\npremature assault may still result in disaster. _As long as the conduct\r\nof the opponent does not show clear indications that his fire power is\r\ncrippled, nothing remains for the attacker but to continue the fight\r\nfor the superiority of fire._”\r\n\r\nEven in this, mistakes are not precluded. It is far from easy to\r\nrecognize when the defender of a position has been sufficiently subdued\r\nby fire to make an assault feasible, and when the proper moment has\r\narrived for launching the reserves. It is only necessary to recall the\r\npremature advance of the artillery and cavalry over the ravine of the\r\nMance brook, on August 18th, 1870.\r\n\r\nThe cessation of the defender’s fire, in itself, is not a sure\r\nsign that his firing line is shaken, as the attacker is unable to\r\ndistinguish between a fire pause ordered by the commander on the\r\ndefensive and the forced discontinuance of the fight. Sure indications\r\nare not available until men actually leave the defender’s fighting line\r\nhere and there, and attempts of the leaders to hold the wavering ones\r\nare clearly apparent.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a leader who has resolved to assault, should order\r\nbayonets fixed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe temporary interruption of the fire occasioned by fixing bayonets is\r\nof no importance, as the superiority of fire has already been gained.\r\nIf bayonets are prematurely ordered to be fixed, the accuracy of the\r\nfire will soon be impaired, as the firing of rifles, weighted down\r\nby the attached bayonets, increases the fatigue of the men. When the\r\ntroops are excited, the downward deflection of the bullets caused by\r\nfixing the bayonet can, however, only produce a good effect. It is\r\nbest to fix bayonets at the signal “Fix bayonet”. In the excitement\r\nprevailing at the moment, it will be impossible to execute the order\r\nwith any uniformity, but it is a good plan, in time of peace, to\r\nrequire one man of each file to fire while the other one fixes his\r\nbayonet. The approaching reserves fix bayonets while on the march.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. THE ASSAULT.\r\n\r\n“The assault does not, strictly speaking, belong to the domain of\r\ntactics. Rules, showing in what formations and under what conditions\r\nthe assault should be made in war, cannot be formulated. At any rate,\r\nfire tactics are not only an essential factor but also the crowning\r\nact of combat; the assault is nothing but the postlude. All modern\r\ncombats show that the morale of the men suffers most, and that, in\r\nconsequence thereof, troops deteriorate quickly when they are exposed\r\nto the annihilating effect of fire. This lesson was thoroughly learned\r\nby the Austrians in 1866, and by the Russians in front of Plevna. Of\r\nwhat avail were ‘self-sacrifice’, the ‘unconquerable determination to\r\ngain the victory’, the ‘desire for hand to hand conflict’, and all\r\nthe other terms that are employed to prove that the moral factors are\r\nthe decisive ones in war? That they are the decisive factors needs\r\nno proof whatever; it follows, as a matter of course, from uniform\r\ntraining, uniform leadership, and uniform arms. But tactics fit for\r\nuse in war, are to furnish, above all else, ways and means, showing\r\nhow and by what methods the fighting energy of troops may be preserved\r\nmost effectively, and thus contribute directly toward preventing the\r\npremature deterioration of the morale of the troops.”[397]\r\n\r\n    [397] Colonel KEIM in _von Löbells Jahresberichte_, 1899, II, p.\r\n  561.\r\n\r\n“The defeat of the opponent is consummated by the assault with fixed\r\nbayonets.” (Par. 324 German I. D. R.). A premature advance to the\r\nassault, with all the peculiar features attending it, produces an\r\naversion against the attack, an undue extension of battle lines, and\r\nmakes it impossible for reinforcements to come up, except under cover\r\nof darkness.\r\n\r\nThe decision for making the assault emanates either from the\r\nsubordinate leaders in the firing line or from the commander of the\r\nwhole force. The latter may give the impulse for the assault by\r\nlaunching the reserve. This is undoubtedly the safer procedure. “When\r\nthe decision to assault emanates from the commanders in rear, notice\r\nthereof is given by sounding the signal ‘fix bayonet’, which must be\r\nrepeated by all the units that are to take part in the assault. At this\r\nsignal the skirmishers increase their fire to the utmost. The parts of\r\nthe firing line which are still in rear, move forward, as quickly as\r\npossible, to a position close to the enemy. All reinforcements in rear\r\nhasten straight to the front. As soon as the leading line is to form\r\nfor the assault, all the trumpeters sound the signal ‘forward, double\r\ntime’, all the drummers beat their drums, and all parts of the force\r\nthrow themselves with the greatest determination upon the enemy. It\r\nshould be a point of honor with skirmishers not to allow the supports\r\nto overtake them earlier than the moment of penetrating the enemy’s\r\nposition. When immediately in front of the enemy, the men should charge\r\nbayonet and, with a cheer, penetrate the position.” (Pars. 346-348\r\nGerman I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for a superior commander to perceive when the\r\nproper moment for making the assault has arrived, as he is compelled\r\nto remain so far in rear of the fighting line, especially where large\r\nforces are concerned, that he can only follow the general course of\r\nthe attack. The first indication which he receives as to whether the\r\nenemy’s fire power has been broken all along the line, is the advance\r\nof his own firing line. He will still more rarely be able to see in\r\ntime when the resistance of the enemy abates at some one point, and\r\nit will be quite impossible for him to issue orders with sufficient\r\npromptness to turn such an advantage quickly to good account.[398]\r\n\r\n    [398] “The attack fed from the rear, which may be likened to the\r\n  closing of a telescope, is one of the most peculiar results of\r\n  constructive theory, which seeks, by this means, to increase the\r\n  energy of the first line, but only succeeds in massing too many men\r\n  in front of the enemy, a better condition than which the enemy could\r\n  not desire.” VON MALACHOWSKI, _Scharfe Taktik und Revue-Taktik_, p.\r\n  230. Incorrect estimate of the situation by the commander of the\r\n  Ist Army on August 18th, 1870. F. HÖNIG, _Vierundzwanzig Stunden\r\n  Moltkescher Strategie_, p. 145. _Der 18. August_, p. 271.\r\n\r\nThe firing line will, therefore, frequently have to take the initiative\r\nin bringing about the assault. It is absolutely necessary, especially\r\nif the enemy evacuates the position, that the firing line, quickly\r\ntaking advantage of this moment, pass over to the bayonet attack. If\r\nthe firing line were to wait until the reserves are up, valuable time\r\nwould be lost, under certain circumstances; the enemy might recover\r\nfrom his temporary bewilderment and re-form, or might even receive\r\nreinforcements. In addition, hesitation on the part of the attacker\r\nwould enable the enemy to gain time, evacuate the position unmolested,\r\nretire in good order, and perhaps take up a new position, or at least\r\nevade quickly the pursuing fire of the assailant. The firing line\r\nwould be the first, in such a case, to perceive when and where the\r\nresistance of the enemy abates; it should therefore make the most of\r\nthis knowledge and throw itself upon the part of the defender’s force\r\nthat is in the act of withdrawing.\r\n\r\nWhen the impulse for the assault emanates from the firing line, there\r\nis danger that instead of a general attack only a local one will\r\nresult. It is impossible to conceive that the whole firing line will\r\nsimultaneously consider that the moment for the assault has arrived;\r\nin general, only a part of that line at a time will come to this\r\nconclusion. Such local attacks are hazardous, however, and have some\r\nchance of succeeding only in covered terrain. A local assault made\r\nby a single battalion or company will usually attract the fire of a\r\nconsiderable portion of the hostile line and quite naturally dash\r\nitself to pieces against it. Even assuming that a gallantly charging\r\nunit succeeds in unexpectedly penetrating the hostile line at some one\r\npoint, the defender will at once attack it in vastly superior force\r\nand compel it to retire with heavy loss. Furthermore, the failure is\r\nusually not confined to the one unit. The troops on the right and left\r\nof it, although they are perhaps farther from the enemy, and have not\r\nyet shaken him sufficiently by their fire, nevertheless join in the\r\nassault, as soon as they see the first unit rush forward. As a rule,\r\nwhen the decision to assault emanates from the firing line, a series\r\nof unsuccessful assaults will result. These will, however, bring good\r\ntroops closer and closer to the enemy, until the great moment of\r\ndefinitely gained superiority finally arrives.\r\n\r\n  The General Staff account of the Franco-German war[399] very aptly\r\n  describes the decisive moment for the assault: “The tension of\r\n  the tactical situation was increased to the highest pitch by the\r\n  prolonged fight at close range; the time was now ripe for the\r\n  decision and the German corps commanders issued orders for the\r\n  assault. Before this order reached the leading line, however, the\r\n  German general officers on the spot had decided, at about 7:30 P.\r\n  M., to undertake the assault on their own responsibility, as they\r\n  considered the attack sufficiently prepared. On the signal given by\r\n  them, and in many instances of their own accord, the Prussian and\r\n  Saxon battalions hurled themselves, just as the sun was setting, on\r\n  the position which had been so long and so tenaciously defended by\r\n  the enemy.” (=St. Privat=). Consult, _Der 18. August_, pp. 525 and\r\n  571.\r\n\r\n    [399] _Gen. St. W._, II, p. 800.\r\n\r\n  “When the XIth Army Corps issued from the =Niederwald= (near\r\n  =Wörth=), the infantry encountered such a heavy fire from the\r\n  direction of =Elsaszhausen= that the troops had to choose between\r\n  either advancing farther or giving up the advantages that had been\r\n  gained at such great sacrifices. The former course was indeed open\r\n  to objection, as the troops were exhausted, as organizations were in\r\n  confusion from the fighting they had just gone through, and as only\r\n  three formed and fresh battalions were available.”--“General von Bose\r\n  now ordered a general attack. At the signal ‘the whole force will\r\n  advance’, the firing lines rushed from the Niederwald and, with loud\r\n  cheers, threw themselves upon the enemy.”[400]\r\n\r\n    [400] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 267.\r\n\r\n  The assault was thus not a result of the superiority that had been\r\n  gained, but an act of desperation in a situation that had become\r\n  unbearable. Moreover, the success of the assault was not due to any\r\n  numerical superiority of the attacker, but to the lack of initiative\r\n  of the defender, and to the fact that he confined himself to purely\r\n  defensive action.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, after all, an open question whether the initiative\r\nof parts of the line should govern the conduct of the entire force. In\r\nsome instances, it certainly ought not to govern, if disaster is to be\r\navoided. When a portion of the firing line advances, however, and the\r\ntactical situation in any way permits, neighboring units should at once\r\nconform to the movement. The units in rear, in particular, should, in\r\nthis case, promptly hurry forward by the shortest route without regard\r\nto losses, support the firing line, and prevent it being repulsed.\r\n(Par. 345, German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThis brings up the question, as to whether the trumpeters of the\r\nassaulting units should sound the signal “fix bayonet,” in this\r\nassault, and thus bring about a prompt general assault by the entire\r\nline. This might obviously cause the troops to advance prematurely\r\nto the assault, a danger which might be brought about by the junior\r\nplatoon commander. No one but the supreme commander, therefore, has\r\nthe right to order this signal to be sounded when he wishes a general\r\nassault to be made. This is prescribed in the German Infantry Drill\r\nRegulations (par. 347). If the commander of the firing line decides\r\nto assault, he transmits his decision to the rear by means of signals\r\n(s. s. s.). The supreme commander can still restrain the skirmishers\r\nby the signal h. h. h., or bring about a general assault all along the\r\nline by giving the signal “fix bayonet”. If a unit moves to the assault\r\ncontrary to the wishes of the supreme commander, he should possess\r\nenough nerve to look on calmly while it is being defeated. It is much\r\nbetter for him to allow a single unit to be defeated than to cause the\r\nfailure of the general attack by a premature advance.\r\n\r\n“Although the assault should be made as nearly simultaneously as\r\npossible, this is not to be understood as meaning that all the units\r\nshould penetrate the hostile position at one and the same time. Such\r\nsimultaneous action is immaterial, and might, indeed, cause parts of\r\nthe line who had a chance of successfully carrying out the assault,\r\nto hesitate because others are still in rear. The power of the attack\r\nwould accordingly be impaired. All units that have once started must\r\ncontinue to advance uninterruptedly.” (Par. 349 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIt depends upon the situation whether the troops intended for the\r\nholding attack finally participate in the assault itself. If they can\r\nbring an effective fire to bear upon the point of attack from an\r\noblique direction and thereby ensure the success of the attack, they\r\nshould make the most of this advantage. (Par. 340 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy advances to the frontal counter-attack, as laid down in\r\nthe Russian and British regulations, the skirmishers throw themselves\r\ndown for the purpose of firing. The supports in the act of moving up\r\ncontinue their march. If the enemy faces about, all the troops press\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n  The French regulations (par. 270) also consider such a counter-attack:\r\n\r\n  “If the attacker presses forward too hastily and if he threatens\r\n  to carry the defender’s position, fresh troops, which have been\r\n  assembled in a place sheltered from view, attack him energetically,\r\n  while the troops already engaged increase the intensity of their\r\n  fire. This powerful and energetic counter-attack produces confusion\r\n  in the enemy’s ranks and compels him to retire, or at least to\r\n  discontinue his forward movement until he has had time to recover....\r\n  The troops in the counter-attack should move forward without\r\n  hesitation and regardless of the cost. When such a forward movement\r\n  has to be discontinued, the commander must decide where it shall\r\n  cease. The efforts of all should be directed toward one object, that\r\n  of tiring and demoralizing the enemy by constant counter-attacks,\r\n  until the moment arrives when the commander must order the offensive\r\n  to be assumed.”\r\n\r\nThe German Infantry Drill Regulations contain no further rules for the\r\nconduct of the assault. If the physical and moral power of the enemy is\r\nso broken by the preceding fire fight that he commences to evacuate his\r\nposition, it is quite immaterial what sort of an assault is made; the\r\nmen simply fire and rush quickly after the retiring enemy. In this case\r\nthe assault is nothing but a postlude of the fire fight.\r\n\r\nA brave and well disciplined opponent who is energetically led, will\r\nnot allow himself to be forced to evacuate his position by fire alone;\r\nto compel him to evacuate his position will at the very least require\r\nthat an assault be threatened.\r\n\r\nBefore the Boer war, the British held the view that the effect of the\r\nfire fight alone was so great that the assault would strike nothing\r\nbut an evacuated or, at most, a feebly defended position. The assault\r\nwas to commence after the enemy had ceased firing and had sought\r\nprotection in his trenches. The following statement is made by one who\r\nfought on the Boer side:\r\n\r\n  “The artillery supported the advance until the latter had arrived\r\n  within 300 or 400 m. of the enemy; then it ceased firing. After a\r\n  brief period of preparation by fire, the British infantry began the\r\n  assault simultaneously in one long line. This assault, made without\r\n  fire support, was repulsed without trouble by the Boer fire. On\r\n  several occasions, short lines of our opponent had begun to advance,\r\n  but these were in every instance forced to throw themselves down\r\n  after a few moments had elapsed. Thereupon the whole British line,\r\n  in my estimation at least 300-400 men strong, began to advance. One\r\n  could clearly hear the British leaders call to their men to cease\r\n  firing, could clearly hear the command ‘fix bayonet’, and the cheer\r\n  ‘God save the Queen’! run along the British line. Then the whole\r\n  hostile line rose. As they rushed toward us, they looked to me like a\r\n  grayish yellow swarm, the men being almost shoulder to shoulder and\r\n  the line being in places three to four men deep, just as frequently\r\n  happens in charges made during our own peace maneuvers. At the same\r\n  moment, we began firing. Our fire was at first somewhat wild, but\r\n  was soon better controlled by our more experienced fighters calling,\r\n  ‘Steady boys, steady, then none of them will reach us’. More and\r\n  more men fell in the British line, and, when it had arrived within\r\n  100 or 80 paces of our position, its energy had spent itself. A\r\n  part of the men threw themselves down behind boulders and fired,\r\n  while the majority rushed back to the shelter of some bushes; but\r\n  even there it was for the most part impossible to hold them. An\r\n  assaulting enemy who does not fire, is not dangerous, even if he is\r\n  numerically superior. In this case, the defender can fire a number\r\n  of times, and the closer the assailant is to the defender’s position\r\n  the more quickly and certainly will his force dwindle away. No one\r\n  will, however, be able to induce the same men to advance again under\r\n  hostile fire over an open field, that is, to expose themselves\r\n  without shelter to the hostile fire.”[401]\r\n\r\n    [401] Supplement 8 to the _Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1901.\r\n\r\n  The same lesson was learned long ago at =Gorni Dubniac= and at\r\n  =Plevna=.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that fire support is essential to the success of such an\r\nassault. This should be furnished in the first place by the artillery.\r\nIn furnishing this support, artillery can employ time fire only until\r\nthe infantry arrives within 300 m. of the enemy, while percussion fire\r\nmay be continued until the infantry arrives within 150 m. of the enemy.\r\nDuring the attack on Pieters Hill (1900), Colonel Kitchener is said\r\nto have told his artillerymen that he would not censure them if two\r\nor three of their shrapnel burst in the ranks of his infantry. The\r\nfollowing statement appears in a British memorial on the lessons of\r\nthe war in the Far East: “The moral effect produced by artillery fire,\r\nwhich forced the defenders to take to cover and did not even permit\r\nthem to raise their heads above the parapet, was so highly esteemed\r\nby the Japanese infantry that it requested the batteries to continue\r\nfiring, without regard to the losses thereby inflicted in its own\r\nranks, until it had taken the position or unfurled small national flags\r\nas an indication that fire support was no longer necessary. According\r\nto the opinion of the Japanese themselves, the losses inflicted in\r\ntheir infantry by their own guns were insignificant in comparison to\r\nthe losses which the defender could inflict by delivering his fire\r\nundisturbed at a range of a few hundred meters, when not kept down by\r\nthe attacking artillery.” According to the Austrian regulations, one\r\nunit is to remain halted for the purpose of directing its fire upon the\r\npoint of attack or upon any reserves that might appear. This provision\r\ninvolves a grave danger, in that it may induce the leader to retain\r\na considerable number of troops in rallying positions, instead of\r\nlaunching his whole force in the assault.\r\n\r\nWhen fire support is deemed necessary in an attack, the artillery will\r\nperhaps be best able to furnish it until the infantry has reached\r\na certain point. Then a moment will arrive, however, when the guns\r\nwill have to cease firing, and when even the infantry units which\r\nhave been left behind to support the attack, will no longer be able\r\nto direct their fire upon the enemy on account of the wide frontage\r\nof the assaulting force. The defender’s troops would have to be poor\r\nindeed, if they would not at this moment, when the assailant’s fire has\r\npractically ceased, raise their heads above the parapet for the purpose\r\nof emptying their magazines once more at the assailant, even though the\r\nfire be unaimed.\r\n\r\nIf the assault is to succeed, it is essential however, that, while the\r\nattacker covers the last 100-150 m., the defender be compelled to keep\r\nunder cover. _This can only be accomplished by employing fire while in\r\nmotion._\r\n\r\nThis fire is practicable because the defender, who has been overwhelmed\r\nin the fire fight, has sought shelter in his works; it is advantageous,\r\nas it is only to compel the enemy to keep under cover. It would\r\nunquestionably be a mistake, and not justifiable in any case, to employ\r\nfire while in motion, when these conditions are not fulfilled, when the\r\nenemy is not completely subdued and is perhaps waiting under cover,\r\nready to meet the assailant’s assault. Supporting the infantry assault\r\nwith fire has, moreover, the additional advantage of preventing the\r\ndefender from bringing up his reserves.\r\n\r\n  The following is taken from a private letter of Sir Ian Hamilton,\r\n  perhaps the foremost British infantry tactician, who had the good\r\n  fortune, at Elandslaagte and Doornkop, of leading his command close\r\n  up to the enemy: “It is my opinion that no matter what regulations\r\n  are promulgated in time of peace, the men will fire during the\r\n  assault. You may rest assured that nothing will prevent their doing\r\n  this. One would do well, therefore, to reckon with this factor from\r\n  the very start. The greatest danger is always that the men will throw\r\n  themselves down instead of continuing the advance. And, if the men\r\n  have once thrown themselves down during the assault, they will rise\r\n  only for the purpose of retreating.”[402]\r\n\r\n    [402] In _Ausbildung der Infanterie für den Angriff_, p. 63,\r\n  Colonel VON DER GOLTZ makes the following statement in regard to an\r\n  experiment: “As the line gradually drew closer to the defender’s\r\n  position, the desire of the individual men to get into the hostile\r\n  position as quickly as possible, became more and more apparent; the\r\n  prone position for firing was abandoned for the kneeling position,\r\n  finally for the standing position, and, quite naturally, fire while\r\n  in motion resulted in the end. Fire while in motion is authorized\r\n  by the regulations and is, in this case, certainly permissible. Its\r\n  employment in this case may be traced to the very proper desire of\r\n  not allowing the enemy, who has been held down this long, to raise\r\n  himself above his parapet. This fire while in motion should not be\r\n  confused with the fire while in motion formerly employed by long\r\n  skirmish lines at long ranges, and condemned at that time. The\r\n  latter had for its object not the keeping down of an enemy already\r\n  overwhelmed, but, on the contrary, was intended to overpower an\r\n  unshaken opponent.”\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= The attacking force approaches the enemy so close (35 m.)\r\n  that the troops are enabled to throw themselves upon him. The point\r\n  at which the hostile position is to be penetrated is designated and\r\n  the men form in rear of their platoon leader. The reserves move at a\r\n  run or by crawling close up to the firing line. If the assault is\r\n  begun at a greater distance than 35 m. from the hostile position,\r\n  fire while in motion is employed, “in order that the enemy may not\r\n  regain his senses and may be prevented from rising above his parapet.”\r\n\r\nDuring an unexpected encounter at night, on unfavorable terrain\r\n(Swiep-Wald at Königgrätz), as well as during obstinate fights for the\r\npossession of fortifications (the Grivica Work at Plevna, Scheinovo),\r\nbayonet combats are unavoidable, provided both forces are equally\r\ndetermined. During the fight for the possession of Servigny, on the\r\nevening of August 31st, 1870, serious hand to hand fighting occurred\r\nin the narrow village streets.[403] The Russo-Japanese war also proved\r\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt that determined troops will maintain their\r\npositions until they are thrown out of them by cold steel.[404]\r\n\r\n    [403] KUNZ, _Noisseville_, p. 51. See p. 134 supra. Fieldmarshal\r\n  MOLTKE makes the following observations in regard to the bayonet\r\n  fights of the campaign of 1859: “General Niel credits his victory at\r\n  Solferino to the use of the bayonet. The question as to how often the\r\n  advance to hand to hand conflict is carried out, may be left open. As\r\n  a rule, it is employed only when it may be presumed that the enemy\r\n  will not await the onslaught.” In his memoranda of 1865, in regard\r\n  to the influence of improved fire arms on tactics, he states: “If\r\n  the bayonet fights, so often mentioned in French accounts of the\r\n  campaign of 1859, were stripped of their dramatic splendor, and if\r\n  the simple prosaic truth could be ascertained, by far the greater\r\n  number of these reports would be corrected in so far as to state that\r\n  the opponent, shaken by more or less heavy losses, avoided the actual\r\n  collision.”\r\n\r\n    [404] Examples: The attack on Tempel Hill on October 11th, In\r\n  _Angriffsverfahren der Japaner_, VON LÜTTWITZ.--The capture of\r\n  works No. 17 and No. 18 by the 2nd Division, on March 1st, 1905\r\n  (Mukden).--Description by an eyewitness of a bayonet fight. Sir IAN\r\n  HAMILTON, _A Staff Officer’s Scrap Book_, p. 252.--A bayonet fight\r\n  occurred in the day time, in the open, when the 11th Rifle Regiment\r\n  broke through the line at Hamatan during the battle on the Yalu,\r\n  (see _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 39-40, p. 131), and in\r\n  Bernaul’s Regiment, during the engagement at Datshishiao, on July\r\n  24th, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe defender will never retire simultaneously all along the line;\r\nfrequently isolated groups and then entire units will leave his\r\nline when the superiority of the attacker’s fire becomes effective.\r\nOfficers, non-commissioned officers and capable privates will endeavor\r\nto keep the weak-kneed from running away.[405]\r\n\r\n    [405] At Villepion, Captain von Hoffmann made a wavering section\r\n  hold its position by springing toward them, revolver in hand, and\r\n  yelling: “I’ll shoot the first man who gets up! my revolver will\r\n  hit too, whether Chassepot bullets will hit you is a question.”\r\n  _Geschichte des Bayerischen Leibregiments_.\r\n\r\nIf the assault is not made at this moment, the crisis may pass, but\r\na determined rush by the attacker will, as a rule, bring about the\r\ndecision. The threat of a bayonet attack usually decides those who have\r\nremained in the position, to make no further resistance. The attacker\r\nmust make use of the moral factors in an assault, hence the importance\r\nof running, cheering, and accompanying the advance of all bodies in\r\nclose order by the beating of drums and the sounding of trumpets.[406]\r\n\r\n    [406] One must read KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 13, pp.\r\n  80, 116, 123 and 156, in order to appreciate what an electrifying\r\n  influence the beating of drums may have even on retreating lines.\r\n\r\n  “The French were unable to withstand an energetic attack, when\r\n  undertaken in anything like sufficient strength and accompanied by\r\n  cheers and beating drums.” BOGUSLAWSKI.\r\n\r\n  “Suddenly some soldier shouted: ‘Columns! Columns!’ Captain von\r\n  Wobeser rose to see what was going on, but at the same moment his men\r\n  rushed back and made straight for the Bois.”--“The mere launching of\r\n  the attack from the direction of =Point du Jour= sufficed to induce\r\n  the well concealed force of about 400 men, which held the gravel\r\n  pits, likewise to beat a retreat that very much resembled a rout.”\r\n  HÖNIG.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace there should be instilled in the soldier the\r\nconviction that, with the bayonet, he is a match for any opponent;\r\nthat, in bayonet fighting, no other infantry is the equal of his own.\r\nThe soldier should not be taught to shrink from the bayonet attack, but\r\nto seek it. If the infantry is deprived of the _arme blanche_, if the\r\nimpossibility of bayonet fighting is preached, and the soldier is never\r\ngiven an opportunity in time of peace of defending himself, man to man,\r\nwith his weapon in bayonet fencing, an infantry will be developed,\r\nwhich is unsuitable for attack and which, moreover, lacks a most\r\nessential quality, viz., the moral power to reach the enemy’s position.\r\n\r\n“The rarity of bayonet fights does not prove the uselessness of the\r\nbayonet, but shows that opponents will rarely be found who are equally\r\ncapable of making use of it. Indeed, the bayonet cannot be abolished\r\nfor the reason, if for no other, that it is the sole and exclusive\r\nembodiment of that will power which alone, both in war and in every-day\r\nlife, attains its object, whereas reason only tends to facilitate the\r\nattainment of the object.\r\n\r\n“Let us assume that there exists an army which bases success in battle\r\non fire action, and takes for granted that the enemy will not be\r\nable to get near enough to make a bayonet attack. If this army were\r\nto encounter another army which, without undervaluing the effect of\r\nfire, remembers the bayonet at the proper time, it would be filled\r\nwith the most dreadful dismay when the enemy actually assails it with\r\nthe bayonet. With modern rifles, bullets are unquestionably a good\r\nsubstitute for the bayonet at close quarters, but this is true only\r\nof troops who do not fear annihilation, _i.e._, troops trained to use\r\nthe bayonet and capable of closing with the enemy after firing. If\r\nthis is not the case, such firing at close quarters is a pure waste\r\nof ammunition, since men who are afraid to close with the enemy, if\r\nnecessary at such a moment, will usually fire into the air.\r\n\r\n“If the soldier has been taught, however, to annihilate the enemy\r\nfrom a distance and from behind cover, he will naturally prefer this\r\nmode of inflicting losses, since he runs very little risk of getting\r\nhurt, and will, moreover, acquire an aversion for exposing himself to\r\ndanger, _i.e._, he will shrink from bayonet work. Hence, if we attach\r\ntoo much importance to marksmanship, we produce a more or less trained\r\nsoldier, who may possibly be a very good shot at long ranges, but who\r\nis not especially inclined to take his chances in a bayonet fight.\r\nIncidentally, target practice develops the mentality of the man, but\r\ndoes not improve his morale.” DRAGOMIROV.\r\n\r\nOf every 100 wounds, the following percentages were produced by cutting\r\nweapons:\r\n\r\n  Campaign of 1859               1.67%\r\n  Campaign of 1864               4.0 %\r\n  Campaign of 1866 (Prussians)   5.4 %\r\n  St. Privat (Germans)           1.0 %\r\n  Russo-Turkish war              0.9 %\r\n\r\nIn time of peace the assaulting distance is to be about 150 m. During\r\nthe Franco-German war, the assault against Elsaszhausen (battle of\r\nWörth) was launched at about 300 m.[407] and that against St. Hubert\r\nat 100-200 m. from the enemy.[408] The 107th Infantry, after charging\r\nover a distance of more than 500 paces, captured a hedge which was held\r\nby the French north of St. Privat, and, in the assault against the\r\nnorthern outskirts of the village, a distance of 300 paces had to be\r\ncovered.[409] In the attack on Le Bourget, on October 30th, 1870, the\r\ncenter column halted when 600 m. from the village; “then began a wild,\r\nheadlong assault against its outskirts.”[410] The Japanese frequently\r\nhad occasion to cross similar stretches at a run, but there were also\r\ninstances where their assaulting troops had only to cover a few meters\r\n(1st Division at Kinchau, 20 m.).\r\n\r\n    [407] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 267.\r\n\r\n    [408] HÖNIG, _Vierundzwanzig Stunden Moltkescher Strategie_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n    [409] _Gen. St. W._, II, p. 804.\r\n\r\n    [410] KUNZ, _Le Bourget_, p. 21.\r\n\r\n=If the attacker succeeds in carrying the position=, he will be\r\nat a disadvantage for the moment; his troops will be in confusion\r\nand exhausted, and a large number of officers will be gone. If the\r\ndefender, reinforced by fresh reserves, takes advantage of this moment,\r\nhe may be able to turn the tide of the battle. The inclination of\r\nthe men to pursue the enemy with the bayonet, instead of halting and\r\nmaking the most of the fire power of their rifles, is noticeable in\r\nall battles. The attacker will have to take steps to restrain his\r\nvictorious infantry, and, as soon as opportunity offers, to pursue\r\nthe enemy with fire. Under cover of this fire fresh troops or quickly\r\nassembled detachments should advance on the flanks in pursuit of the\r\nenemy. There is a wide difference between a wild, headlong rush after\r\nthe enemy and a systematic pursuit. Infantry that rushes headlong to\r\nthe front after penetrating a position must be brought back at any\r\ncost, unless it can enter a second position simultaneously with the\r\nenemy.[411]\r\n\r\n    [411] The conduct of the 47th Infantry Brigade after the capture\r\n  of Ste. Marie aux Chênes. _Der 18. August_, p. 184. The second line\r\n  of the position at Düppel was carried by the pursuing victors at the\r\n  first rush. _Gen. St. W._, 1864, II, p. 539.\r\n\r\nIn addition to pursuing the enemy with fire, the attacker should\r\nre-form his troops without regard to their original arrangement (if\r\nthe enemy gives him time enough, the original organizations should\r\nbe re-formed), occupy the position, replenish ammunition, and remove\r\nthe prisoners. It is a mistake to mass more rifles in the captured\r\nposition than can be employed to advantage, as the enemy will in all\r\nprobability direct a heavy fire upon it. As soon as the fight has been\r\ndecided, the echelons in rear should be halted, so that they can be\r\nemployed as occasion demands. The leaders of these units will often\r\nhave to act independently in such a case. (Par. 350 German I. D. R.).\r\nPreparations should be made to the end that hostile counter-attacks\r\nmay be at once repulsed. These rules are particularly important when\r\nthe position that has been carried is not the main position but only\r\nan advanced post.[412] These measures must be taken independently\r\nby all leaders who participated in the assault, without waiting for\r\norders from superior authority. The pursuit should be begun as soon as\r\npossible with formed bodies of troops (if practicable, while the enemy\r\nis being pursued by fire), in order to interfere with his re-forming,\r\nto prevent his taking up route column, and to overrun his rallying\r\npositions. The battle of Beaumont consisted of a whole series of such\r\npursuing actions. The arrival of night should by no means be used as an\r\nexcuse for discontinuing the pursuit, for night above all else is the\r\nmightiest ally of a bold victor.[413]\r\n\r\n    [412] See _Taktik_, V, p. 359, et seq. See also the measures taken\r\n  after the capture of St. Privat. _Der 18. August_, p. 533. The\r\n  situation in Fröschweiler; KUNZ. _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_,\r\n  17. pp. 109 and 153. As in peace, the signals, ‘the whole force\r\n  assemble,’ and ‘the whole force halt,’ was sounded everywhere. How\r\n  little the infantry was inclined to pursue is shown by the conduct\r\n  of the 94th and the 32nd Infantry Regiments. _Ibid._, pp. 87-90. The\r\n  10th Company of the 32nd Infantry marched fully two miles to the rear\r\n  to a bivouac which they had left in the morning.\r\n\r\n    [413] See _Taktik_, V. p. 436.\r\n\r\n=If the attack fails=, it will be the duty of the commander to arrest\r\nthe flight of the skirmishers who are rushing to the rear under hostile\r\nfire. It will be impossible, however, to halt these men while they\r\nare exposed to the most effective fire of the enemy. Only when the\r\nnearest cover is reached can there be any question of halting. (Par.\r\n327 German I. D. R.). When cover is not available near at hand, the\r\nexhaustion of the troops will soon stop the flight, or the leaders\r\nmay be able to face them again to the front, as soon as the hostile\r\nfire abates. However, the retreating troops will have placed quite a\r\ndistance between themselves and the enemy before this can be done, and\r\nthe latter, unmolested by fire from the attacker, will be able to take\r\nfull advantage of the technical qualities of his rifle, unless the\r\nattacker’s artillery or cavalry prevent his doing so. No matter where\r\nthe retreating troops come to a halt and face to the front, there they\r\nmust stay, and, if the hostile fire permits, intrench.\r\n\r\n  The perseverance of the Prussian Guard 600-800 m. in front of\r\n  =St. Privat=,[414] and of the British Brigade of Highlanders at\r\n  =Magersfontain=, immediately in front of the Boer position, on\r\n  December 11th, 1899, is worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\n    [414] The distance at which the first attack came to a standstill\r\n  is variously given as 300 (3rd Guard Regiment and IInd Battalion of\r\n  the 1st Guard Regiment) and 800-900 paces (2nd Guard Regiment). See\r\n  _History of the 3rd Guard Regiment_, pp. 276, 279 and 280; that of\r\n  the _1st Guard Regiment_, p. 165; that of the _2nd Guard Regiment_,\r\n  p. 232. “Headed by a few of the officers who still remained,\r\n  the depleted lines clung to the slope; with iron endurance and\r\n  self-sacrifice they maintained the dearly bought positions.” _Gen.\r\n  St. W._, II, p. 872.\r\n\r\n  The assault on =Gorni Dubniac= came to a standstill at very short\r\n  range, and a part of the skirmishers of the Moscow and Pavlov\r\n  Regiments maintained their positions 50 m., the remaining Russian\r\n  skirmishers 320 m., from the trench.[415]\r\n\r\n    [415] PUSYREWSKI, _Die russische Garde_, p. 126.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THE USE OF THE SPADE IN ATTACK.\r\n\r\n(Pars. 157, 313, 339, 380 and 381 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nIn every attack there are situations in which it may be advantageous to\r\nuse intrenching tools--\r\n\r\n1. In fortifying rallying positions.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, whose mode of waging war was very cautious, fortified the\r\ninitial positions from which their attacks were made, in order that\r\nthey might have rallying positions in case of defeat.[416]\r\n\r\n    [416] On July 19th, 1904, the 12th Infantry Division (Ist Army)\r\n  had pushed back Russian troops at Shaotao and at once fortified a\r\n  position 2700 m. from the new Russian position at Yushuling. From\r\n  this position the 12th Division advanced, on July 31st, as a Russian\r\n  attack had not taken place. The extended fortifications facing the\r\n  Russian Shaho position were made with the same end in view. The war\r\n  in the Far East was one of positions, since neither army possessed\r\n  sufficient freedom of action. See p. 341, et seq., supra.\r\n\r\n2. In intrenching after making an advance under cover of darkness to\r\nwithin effective range of the enemy for the purpose of opening fire at\r\ndaybreak. In this case, the advancing force is, as a rule, instructed\r\nto advance until it comes under hostile fire and then to intrench.[417]\r\n\r\n    [417] During the attack on Paardeberg, on February 27th, 1900, the\r\n  Canadians were ordered to advance before daybreak from their trenches\r\n  located 500 m. from the Boer position, and to throw themselves down\r\n  and to intrench as soon as they were fired upon. This was done\r\n  when the force was 100 m. from the enemy. _Kriegsgeschichtliche\r\n  Einzelschriften_, 33, p. 60.\r\n\r\n    The Japanese 45th Infantry, in its advance under cover of darkness\r\n  against Oerrshikiatsi (Shaho) was first fired upon at a range of 1000\r\n  m., whereupon the men threw themselves down and intrenched; when the\r\n  hostile fire abated, the regiment advanced again, and when the enemy\r\n  resumed his fire, it intrenched. A third advance brought the regiment\r\n  within 500 m. of the defender’s position and it was able to make the\r\n  assault during the forenoon of October 12th, 1904.\r\n\r\n3. In intrenching an echelon posted to cover advancing infantry.\r\n\r\n4. In fortifying a captured position. The want of intrenching tools in\r\nquickly putting captured positions in a state of defense, so often felt\r\nduring the Franco-German war and the Russo-Turkish war, has now been\r\nremoved by the introduction of portable tools.[418] The necessity of\r\nquickly preparing captured positions for defense presented itself in a\r\nnumber of instances.\r\n\r\n    [418] Examples: The French in St. Privat. The Germans and later\r\n  the French in Noisseville. on September 1st, 1870. Villepion,\r\n  on December 1st, 1870 (HÖNIG, _Volkskrieg_, III, p. 257; KUNZ,\r\n  _Loigny_, p. 49): Les Granges, on January 11th, 1871 (_Geschichte des\r\n  Regiments Nr. 20_. p. 297). Fortifying the position on the second\r\n  ridge of the Green Hills in front of Plevna, on September 10th, 1877\r\n  (KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, II, p. 178). Tempel Hill (Terrayama), on October\r\n  11th, 1904. In the last mentioned case three offensive returns were\r\n  repulsed from the captured position, which had been prepared for\r\n  defense. The fights for the possession of the village of Linchinpu\r\n  (on the right bank of the Shaho, north of the railway), captured\r\n  on October 14th, were still more obstinate; the position had to be\r\n  prepared for defense under hostile artillery fire. (VON TETTAU,\r\n  _Achtzehn Monate mit Russlands Heeren in der Mandschurei_, II, p.\r\n  136).\r\n\r\n5. In holding ground that has been gained in an attack when further\r\nadvance is impossible, that is, in situations such as confronted the\r\ninfantry of the Guard on August 18th when its first attack came to a\r\nstandstill. During the attack on Gorni Dubniac, in the Russo-Turkish\r\nwar, the Russian Guard intrenched when a further advance became\r\nimpossible. During the attack on Telish, which occurred a few days\r\nlater, specific orders were issued for the troops to intrench when\r\n1000-2000 m. from the Turkish works.[419]\r\n\r\n    [419] PUSYREWSKI, _Die russische Garde_, p. 166.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the lessons gained in the Russo-Turkish war, general\r\ninstructions were issued to the Russian infantry on the subject of\r\nintrenching in attack. According to these instructions, the spade was\r\nto be used in attack in the following cases: In fortifying a captured\r\nposition, as a protection against a possible offensive return of the\r\ndefender; in holding supporting points necessary to a continuation of\r\nthe attack; and in placing rallying positions in a state of defense.\r\nThe order directing troops to intrench was to be given, in all cases,\r\nby the supreme commander. The following procedure was to be observed:\r\n“Every man equipped with a spade and who is not sheltered by some\r\nfeature of the terrain, places his rifle on the ground and, lying on\r\nhis left side, begins to excavate a hole parallel to his body. This\r\nhole should be as long as the distance from his left elbow to his knee,\r\nas wide as the length of the spade-handle, and as deep as the width of\r\nthe blade of the spade. The excavated earth and sod he places in front\r\nof his head, which he endeavors to protect as quickly as possible. When\r\nthis work is completed, he rolls over into the excavated hole, and,\r\nlying on his right side, repeats the operation. When he has obtained\r\nsufficient cover, he hands his spade to the other man of the file, who\r\nproceeds in a similar fashion.”\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, on account of their numerical inferiority, found it\r\nnecessary to get along with few supports and reserves, and therefore\r\nmade use of the spade in terrain devoid of cover, or utilized sand\r\nbags,[420] which were carried along. In this manner, they laboriously\r\nworked their way to within assaulting distance of the enemy. In many\r\ninstances, this necessitated whole days of fighting when an envelopment\r\nwas impossible. Sand bags were an advantage when the ground was frozen\r\nor when the sod was not thick.\r\n\r\n    [420] See p. 344 supra. Frequently the bags, which could be tied\r\n  with a string, were filled near the place where they were to be used.\r\n  The advance was considerably retarded by carrying along sand bags.\r\n  During the attack on Yuputz, on March 1st, 1905, by the 8th Infantry\r\n  Division of the IInd Army, the first sand bag cover was constructed\r\n  700 m. and the last 250 m. from the village.\r\n\r\n  _Results of Russian experiments._ The sand bag employed was made\r\n  of coarse linen of grayish green color and when filled and tied,\r\n  was approximately 50 cm. long (width of a man’s shoulders), 30-35\r\n  cm. wide, and 30-35 cm. high. The filled sand bag weighed 14-20\r\n  kg., depending upon the filling material (sand or broken stone).\r\n  When filled with sand or broken stone, the sand bag stopped all\r\n  projectiles, while, when filled with earth, even two bags placed in\r\n  rear of each other did not afford sufficient protection. The sand\r\n  bags were scarcely discernible with the naked eye at 400 m. They were\r\n  not an easy target to hit, and, even at 300 m., it was difficult to\r\n  aim at them.\r\n\r\n  The men had a distinct aversion against constructing shelter trenches\r\n  while lying down. During the war they could be made to intrench only\r\n  by great exertions on the part of the officers. The reason for this\r\n  is obvious; digging with the small spade while in a prone position\r\n  is uncomfortable. The skirmisher considers it much more profitable\r\n  to fire than to puzzle out how he can best stir up the soil with the\r\n  small spade while in a prone position. Moreover, he knows that at any\r\n  moment he may have to make a rush to the front.\r\n\r\n  The beautiful idea that these trenches were to be used and widened\r\n  by the reserves, was usually not carried out. The reserves preferred\r\n  to make longer rushes and to take advantage of folds of the ground\r\n  rather than occupy themselves with intrenching under hostile fire.\r\n\r\n  At ranges from 2000-1000 m., single men made short rushes, only 30-40\r\n  m. long, as the filled sand bag constituted a considerable load.\r\n  Before a man ran forward, he slung his rifle, grasped the sand bag\r\n  with one hand at the tied end, with the other at a loop specially\r\n  provided for that purpose; then he jumped up, ran forward 30-40 m.,\r\n  as rapidly as he could in a crouching position, placed the sand bag\r\n  on the ground, and threw himself down behind it. Under effective\r\n  hostile fire, at 1000-550 m. (during our peace maneuvers at 420-280\r\n  m.), the men then crawl forward, utilizing the sand bag as cover.\r\n  The men would rather crawl a greater distance with the sand bag than\r\n  intrench while lying down.\r\n\r\n  From the position of the enemy, the skirmishers lying behind grayish\r\n  green sand bags could not be recognized with the naked eye at\r\n  2000-1000 m. It is reported that both officers and men were at first\r\n  very much disinclined toward making these experiments, but that they\r\n  changed their views after one or two exercises, and the principal\r\n  apprehension, that of increasing the weight of the field equipment,\r\n  disappeared because of the undeniable advantages of the sand bag.\r\n\r\nSuch cover constructed by the assailant has no greater value than\r\nnatural cover found on the ground over which the attack is made; it\r\naffords protection during halts and induces retreating skirmishers to\r\nface to the front again at an earlier moment than would otherwise be\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n“It should not be forgotten, however, that time gained is of greater\r\nbenefit to the defender than to the assailant. Moreover, the great\r\ndifficulty of inducing a firing line which has made a lodgment under\r\nhostile fire, to advance from its laboriously constructed cover,\r\nadmonishes us to be cautious in employing the spade during an attack.\r\nThe construction of cover ought never to impair the desire for making\r\nan impetuous attack, or destroy the offensive spirit.” (Par. 313 German\r\nI. D. R.).\r\n\r\nWhen a body of troops intrenches during an attack, it must detach\r\nhalf of its force to keep up the attack; this cannot be offset by an\r\nincreased rate of fire, even if squad leaders, range finders, and\r\nmusicians, take part in the fight, as the men offer a taller target\r\nwhile intrenching, and as the newly turned earth facilitates the\r\nenemy’s aim. A superiority of fire that has been gained may thereby be\r\nlost. However, when the defender’s troops have been so shaken that the\r\nassailant can detach half of his rifles with impunity, the latter need\r\nnot remain lying on the ground, but can advance, in most cases, closer\r\nto the enemy’s position. The use of the spade is, therefore, proper\r\nonly when ground that has been gained is to be held, and when the\r\nenemy’s fire permits intrenching.\r\n\r\n  =Russia.= In instructions issued by General Kuropatkin, the following\r\n  statement in regard to the Japanese infantry appears: “It advances in\r\n  widely deployed lines. The firing line advances by short, alternating\r\n  rushes, the men then throwing themselves down and intrenching. In\r\n  spite of our extraordinarily violent fire, the firing line continues\r\n  to advance by alternate rushes, leaves its half completed shelter\r\n  trenches and begins to dig new ones. The supports then advance by\r\n  alternate rushes, occupy the first line of trenches and complete\r\n  them. When the firing line advances from the second line of trenches,\r\n  they are occupied by the supports, while the reserves move up into\r\n  the first line of trenches. In this manner, the advance is continued\r\n  by successive rushes. From this, it is apparent that the infantryman\r\n  in the firing line must act on his own initiative in selecting a\r\n  point for intrenching.”\r\n\r\n  =Japan.= In a number of cases, the Japanese conducted an attack in\r\n  the manner described. At Liao Yang, on September 1st, 1904, shelter\r\n  trenches were dug at 750 and at 530 m. from the Russian position.\r\n  The advance beyond this was so managed that the men intrenched after\r\n  every rush, finally arriving, in the course of the day, within 300\r\n  m. of the enemy. An assault made from this position on the afternoon\r\n  of the 2nd was repulsed. The whole Japanese line again faced to the\r\n  front on arriving in the shelter trenches which they had dug 300 m.\r\n  from the hostile position. The Japanese now perfected their weak\r\n  intrenchments and were even able to repulse two counter-attacks\r\n  made by the Russians. This was certainly an exceptional case, and,\r\n  besides, it involved an attack on a fortified position.\r\n\r\n  The German Manual of Field Engineering (No. 46) recommends that the\r\n  man, when lying on his left side, construct in the first place a\r\n  parapet 30 cm. high, as head cover and rifle rest. This produces pits\r\n  50 cm. wide, 60 cm. long, and 40 cm. deep, usually deeper in front\r\n  than in rear, which makes aiming uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n  =France.= According to the _Instruction pratique sur les travaux de\r\n  campagne_ (24th October, 1906), the men are to improve available\r\n  cover; where natural cover is wanting, artificial cover is to\r\n  be constructed when the hostile fire compels a halt or the men\r\n  are forced to halt to regain their breath. At short ranges, the\r\n  skirmishers dig individual pits. It is desirable for the soldier to\r\n  use his knapsack as cover while working, and to leave it in position\r\n  later also, to get better head cover.\r\n\r\n  =England.= Although the troops are not equipped with portable\r\n  intrenching tools, it is prescribed that captured positions be\r\n  fortified; in open country, when the hostile fire is too hot, this is\r\n  to be done at night.\r\n\r\n  The suggestion of creating cover for skirmishers by using the\r\n  pits produced by short shell salvos, is a singular one. Detailed\r\n  experiments have been made in =Austria=.[421] In instructions issued\r\n  by the commander of the XIth Corps, it was recommended that, when\r\n  exposed to moderate hostile fire, the soldier should hug the ground\r\n  as closely as possible while at work. The intrenching proceeded\r\n  most rapidly when the soldier first excavated the ground in front\r\n  and threw it forward. But in order to do this, the man has to push\r\n  himself backward during the work and must throw the earth some\r\n  distance. The parapet is low, but affords sufficient protection.\r\n\r\n    [421] _Streffleur_, 1906, III, p. 387.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  The task is greater when the soldier lies first on his left, then on\r\n  his right side, removes earth from a borrow pit at his right and then\r\n  from one on his left, and piles it up in front. As the skirmisher\r\n  lies on the natural surface of the ground during this operation, he\r\n  naturally constructs a higher parapet.\r\n\r\nThe following general rules governing the use of the spade in attack\r\nmay be laid down:\r\n\r\n1. An invariable use of the spade in attack must be unhesitatingly\r\ncondemned. The best means of gaining the superiority of fire, and the\r\nbest protection against hostile fire, is our own fire.\r\n\r\n2. It must not be left to the soldier’s discretion, as to whether or\r\nnot he shall intrench. The order for intrenching should in every case\r\nemanate from the supreme commander.\r\n\r\n3. As a rule, the spade should be used in those phases of combat that\r\npartake more of a defensive character, in particular--\r\n\r\n(a) To protect artillery and prepare rallying positions during the\r\npreparatory stage of the action;\r\n\r\n(b) To shelter troops detailed to contain the enemy while enveloping\r\nmovements are in progress;\r\n\r\n(c) To shelter troops that are to keep down the hostile fire by their\r\nown delivered from enfilading or commanding positions;\r\n\r\n(d) To maintain a strip of ground or a supporting point that has just\r\nbeen gained, whether this has been captured from the enemy or whether\r\nthe attack has come to a standstill at that point and a pause in the\r\nfighting occurs.\r\n\r\n4. An attack with the aid of the spade from trench to trench is\r\nadvisable only in exceptional cases, when the attack is a purely\r\nfrontal one and is made over ground devoid of cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. THE EMPLOYMENT OF RESERVES.[422]\r\n\r\n(Pars. 294, 295, 366, 388, 393, 427 and 436 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [422] _Taktik_, V. p. 334, et seq.\r\n\r\nThe infantry attack may be characterized as a fire fight. It would seem\r\ndesirable to surround the enemy’s zone of approach, or the position\r\none wishes to attack, from the very outset with a dense, continuous\r\nline of rifles, and to overcome the resistance of the enemy in the\r\nearliest phases of the combat by means of an overwhelming volume of\r\nfire from as many rifles as possible. The impediments that stand in\r\nthe way of carrying out this idea lie in the terrain, the ignorance of\r\nthe enemy’s position, and in human nature. The defender can be driven\r\nfrom his position only by an attack; the impulse for an advance must be\r\ngiven by fresh troops; and the success gained by the firing line must\r\nbe clinched by a retained assaulting force. The necessity of having\r\na formed body of troops available, until the fight is in full swing,\r\nto meet unforeseen contingencies, further requires that a reserve\r\nbe provided. Organizations should not be broken up any more than is\r\nabsolutely necessary. The number of troops which the commander will\r\nretain for the time being, will depend upon the amount of information\r\nhe has in regard to the situation. During an attack the reserve is\r\nfrequently not designated until a preparatory position is taken up. In\r\nattack about ¹⁄₄-¹⁄₃, and in defense ¹⁄₆-¹⁄₂ of the whole force is put\r\nin the reserve, depending upon whether the ensuing action is to be a\r\npurely defensive one or the decision is sought.\r\n\r\nThe reserve enables the commander to “shift the center of gravity of\r\nthe fight to the point desired by him, to reinforce his line where he\r\nconsiders proper, to equalize fluctuations of the combat, and, finally,\r\nto bring about the decision.” (Par. 294 German I. D. R.). As the combat\r\nprogresses, the commander must decide whether the situation is such\r\nas to compel him to employ the reserves to cover his retreat,[423] or\r\nwhether it is proper for him to put in his last troops for the purpose\r\nof gaining the victory. If the reserve has been put in and the attack\r\nfails (or, as at Wörth, the defender succumbs after putting in all the\r\nreserves) defeat is certain; but it would be a mistake not to employ\r\nthe reserve, to keep it in readiness to cover a possible retreat, if\r\nits intervention can yet bring about a favorable termination of the\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\n    [423] See deliberations of General v. d. Tann at Coulmiers. HELVIG,\r\n  _Das erste bayerische Armeekorps_, p. 203.\r\n\r\n  The employment of the reserves by the Russians at =Plevna=, on\r\n  September 11th, 1877: The general reserve consisted of nine\r\n  battalions and was too weak to make an impression at one point;\r\n  fifteen battalions were detailed to cover the lines of communication\r\n  and the artillery (which was not at all in danger). Forty battalions\r\n  that did not enter the fight were scattered all over the battlefield,\r\n  no one being able to account for their presence.[424] When Skobeleff\r\n  had effected a lodgment in the Turkish position, every available\r\n  man should have been sent to this point. Although there were 9\r\n  battalions, 30 guns, and 4 troops (_Eskadrons_) available, only\r\n  the Schuja Regiment (1300 men), which had suffered heavy losses in\r\n  previous actions, was despatched to the point in question, and that\r\n  more for the purpose of covering the retreat than to make the most of\r\n  the success that had been gained.\r\n\r\n    [424] In the Franco-German war, the same thing happened on the\r\n  German side. _Der 18. August_, p. 221.\r\n\r\n  In contrast to the Japanese commanders, who promptly launched all\r\n  their troops, the Russian commanders were inclined to despatch\r\n  numerous detachments, to organize provisional units, while completely\r\n  ignoring existing organizations (this had, indeed, also the\r\n  advantage that a suitable leader could be found for carrying a\r\n  special mission into execution), and to form strong reserves by\r\n  details from any and all imaginable units. These reserves were\r\n  frequently not used at all.[425]\r\n\r\n    [425] On July 31st, 1904, when, in pursuance of orders from General\r\n  Headquarters, a regiment and a battery was to be despatched to\r\n  Mistshenko’s Cavalry Division, 15 km. away, a provisional regiment\r\n  of two battalions was formed, without apparent reason, for the\r\n  purpose from the 139th and 140th Infantry Regiments. In regard to the\r\n  inclination of the Russians to form detachments, see LÖFFLER, I, pp.\r\n  11, 27, 53 and 54.\r\n\r\n  On March 5th, 1905, the commanding general of the Xth Army Corps\r\n  (Zerpitzki) had available one brigade of his 31st Division, one\r\n  regiment of his 9th Division, one regiment of the VIIIth Corps, three\r\n  Rifle regiments of the mixed Rifle Corps, the 5th Rifle Brigade, and\r\n  one regiment of the Vth Siberian Army Corps.[426]\r\n\r\n    [426] See V. TETTAU, _Achtzehn Monate mit Russlands Heeren in der\r\n  Mandschurei_, II, p. 483.\r\n\r\n  On October 15th, in the battle on the =Shaho=, the general reserve\r\n  of the army consisted of 32 battalions belonging to five different\r\n  divisions and five different army corps. In his order for the battle,\r\n  Kuropatkin laid particular stress on the necessity of forming\r\n  reserves (Army Orders dated August 15th, 1904): “Keeping back more\r\n  than half of the force in reserve is the best guarantee for success.”\r\n  On December 27th, 1904, he made a similar statement.\r\n\r\nThe reserves are created to be used; every available man must\r\nparticipate in the decisive stage of the combat. If the enemy yields\r\nbefore the reserve is launched, so much the better; if he does not give\r\nway, all the troops that are at hand must be put in. The main thing is\r\nto gain the victory; scruples may be indulged in afterwards. A defeated\r\ncommander who leaves the battlefield with troops that are still\r\npartially intact, has not made the most of the means at his disposal\r\nfor combat, provided the situation was such that the launching of the\r\nreserves could have secured the victory. As shown by Hastenbeck (1757),\r\nby Idstedt (1850), and by Bapaume, at the moment of the crisis there is\r\nno sharp dividing line between victory and defeat, and the reserves may\r\ndecide the fate of the day. The decision of Archduke Albrecht, during\r\nthe battle of Custozza (1866), to push his last reserves into the fight\r\nwas worthy of a great commander.\r\n\r\n  In contrast with this, =Russia= (1904): “In employing the general\r\n  reserve, the commander-in-chief must be even more economical than\r\n  the troop leader; he should, when necessary, detail single units to\r\n  support this or that section, _but he should in no case use up his\r\n  whole reserve before the decision has occurred_.” The failures of\r\n  the British in the South African war may likewise be traced in part\r\n  to a faulty use of the reserves. Thus, we read in the regulations of\r\n  1896: “The reserve should occupy a favorable defensive position in\r\n  order to check the enemy in case of defeat; if the attack succeeds,\r\n  the reserve should move up into the position and take charge of the\r\n  pursuit.”\r\n\r\n“Troops that give up a fight are like the swimmer who, after having\r\nmade the most inconceivable exertions to swim across a broad, deep\r\nriver, shrinks from the last spurt and drowns, although he need only\r\nstretch out his arm to reach the opposite shore.” (DRAGOMIROV).\r\n\r\nIn employing the reserve, it should be remembered that the whole\r\navailable force must be launched at the decisive moment at the decisive\r\npoint, and that the commander ought not to detach portions of the force\r\nintended for the decisive blow for tasks of secondary importance.\r\n\r\n  The launching of L’Estocq’s Corps at =Preussisch-Eylau=, is still a\r\n  model worthy of imitation.[427]\r\n\r\n    [427] LETTOW-VORBECK, _Feldzug von 1806 und 1807_, IV, p. 107.\r\n\r\n  In the battle of =Vionville=, three battalions and four batteries\r\n  were detached from the 20th Infantry Division, which had arrived\r\n  during the afternoon, and sent to the right flank to take part in\r\n  the action of the 5th Infantry Division, as infantry support seemed\r\n  necessary on the right flank. When the head of the division reached\r\n  Tronville, the question was discussed, as to whether it was desirable\r\n  first to concentrate the division for action, or to throw the leading\r\n  battalions into the Tronville forest, where portions of Lehman’s\r\n  Brigade were still holding their ground. As an advance of the French\r\n  out of the woods would have endangered the left flank of the Prussian\r\n  artillery line, three battalions were at once thrown into the forest,\r\n  while the six remaining battalions were kept in reserve for the time\r\n  being. Subsequently, three more battalions were sent forward to\r\n  reinforce the infantry engaged in the forest\r\n\r\n  “What a decisive blow the 20th Division could have struck, if it had\r\n  been employed in one body!” (V. LIEBERT).[428]\r\n\r\n    [428] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 595. _Kriegsgeschichtliche\r\n  Einzelschriften_, 18, p. 580.--V. SCHERFF, _Kriegslehren_, II,\r\n  p. 146.--Essay by V. LIEBERT published in Supplement of the\r\n  _Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1895. From the description contained in\r\n  the 4th Supplement of the _Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1895, p. 177. It\r\n  appears, at any rate, that the support given by the 39th Half-Brigade\r\n  was not absolutely necessary. On the right flank as well, a united\r\n  employment of the force for the attack of Hill 970 ought to have\r\n  been possible; as it was, regiments were cut up in making isolated\r\n  assaults, which had no effect whatever on the outcome of the general\r\n  action. KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 8/9, p. 128, et seq.\r\n\r\nThe decision is usually brought about by pressure on a flank, but it\r\nmight become necessary to accomplish this result by launching large\r\nmasses against some point of the hostile front.[429]\r\n\r\n    [429] General MINARELLI-FITZGERALD, _Infanteriemassen im Angriff_.\r\n  Colonel CSICSERICS VON BACSANY of the Austrian Army, in a brilliant\r\n  study entitled _Die Schlacht_ (Vienna, 1908), argues that with the\r\n  increased combat frontage of armies, local successes have no longer\r\n  the same Influence on the outcome of the battle as of old. Compare,\r\n  for example, the envelopment of the Russian left flank at Liao Yang,\r\n  and the penetration of the line at Yuhuntun (Mukden), with the effect\r\n  produced by the capture of Chlum and St. Privat on the outcome of the\r\n  battles of Königgrätz and Gravelotte, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of accomplishing this are best illustrated by the\r\nsituation of the IIIrd Army Corps on the afternoon of August 18th,\r\n1870, when Prince Frederick Charles yielded to the entreaties of\r\nGeneral von Alvensleben and permitted him to advance south of the\r\nBois de la Cusse.[430] Similar situations resulted in the case of the\r\nAustrian 1st and VIth Army Corps at Königgrätz, the French IIIrd and\r\nIVth Army Corps, on a front of 2.75 km., with the Guards in rear,\r\nbetween Noisseville and Failly, and, finally, the advance of the\r\n1st East Siberian Rifle Division at Wafangu. The French regulations\r\nlikewise contemplate a decisive attack made by large masses on a narrow\r\nfront. If these troops which are to clinch the success gained by the\r\nfighting line, are deployed on the front laid down in regulations, they\r\nwill be unable to use their weapons. It isn’t mechanical shock action,\r\nbut fire effect that decides the battle. In such a mass of troops, only\r\nfractional parts will be able to fire, the major portion is crowded\r\ntogether and becomes a dense, defenseless target, exposed to all the\r\npsychological impressions produced by crowding human beings into a\r\nnarrow space.[431]\r\n\r\n    [430] _Der 18. August_, pp. 484 and 558, sketches 34 and 35.\r\n\r\n    [431] The successful attacks made by masses of fanatical warriors\r\n  in colonial wars are carried out under such peculiar conditions that,\r\n  for our purposes, deductions therefrom are not admissible. The defeat\r\n  of the two French brigades at Bang-Bo (24th March, 1885), and at\r\n  Ki-lua (28th March, 1885). LEHAUCOURT, _Les Expéditions de Tonkin_.\r\n  The defeat of the Italians at Adua (1st March. 1896).\r\n\r\nA brigade, therefore, should not deploy on a front of 1500 m., _i.e._,\r\nput only about ¹⁄₄ of its men in the first line; but no objection can\r\nbe made if the brigade, in moving to the final decisive assault, at\r\nonce advances on a front of 2500-3000 m.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. THE CONDUCT OF THE LEADERS IN ACTION.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of troop leading increase as the power of the\r\ncommander to control and direct all ranks in action by words of command\r\ndiminishes. In action, therefore, those means must be adopted that will\r\nfacilitate the transmission of orders. This requires first of all the\r\nchoice of an appropriate position for the leader.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of an action should find the leader as far forward as\r\npossible; during the advance to the battlefield, with the advance\r\nguard (par. 277 German I. D. R.), for neither messages nor reports,\r\nnor a map can adequately take the place of personal inspection of the\r\nsituation of the enemy, of neighboring units, and of the ground. So\r\nplaced, he can best direct the first deployment, upon which the future\r\ncourse of the action so largely depends, secure advantages by making\r\nprompt decisions in face of the enemy, save his own troops from making\r\ndetours, handle them in accordance with a definite plan, and preclude\r\narbitrary action on the part of the commander of the leading unit.\r\n\r\nDuring the action, the superior commander can influence the course\r\nof the fight, his personal example excepted, only by employing his\r\nreserves. His place is, therefore, near the reserves, at a point that\r\ncan be readily found, and never in the firing line.\r\n\r\nA company commander should remain where he believes he can best control\r\nhis company, as a rule, perhaps in the firing line. He provides for the\r\nsupply and distribution of ammunition that is brought up from the rear,\r\nand regulates the coöperation of the platoons. (Pars. 216, 457 and 458\r\nGerman I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nA battalion commander should only in very exceptional cases take post\r\nin the firing line; he should nearly always remain with parts of the\r\nforce that are held back for the time being, but, in any case, where\r\nhe can effectively supervise his battalion. The choice of a regimental\r\ncommander’s position is influenced by the same considerations; when his\r\nregiment is acting as part of a brigade, he must select his position so\r\nas to facilitate the transmission of orders from brigade headquarters.\r\nThe brigade commander will, as a rule, remain near his reserves, at a\r\npoint from which he can best overlook the deployment of his brigade.\r\n\r\nOn account of the fact that extended order fighting predominates,\r\nleaders of all grades must be particularly careful to maintain\r\nconnection between the several parts of their command, with each other,\r\nand with adjoining units, and to preserve their influence over their\r\nfiring lines. Superior commanders should, in addition, see that their\r\ntroops do not get out of hand, and all subordinate leaders, after\r\ncarrying out a task assigned them, should endeavor promptly to rejoin\r\ntheir proper commands, or place themselves at the disposal of the\r\ncommander of troops still engaged with the enemy.\r\n\r\nThese requirements will be fulfilled, if superior commanders order\r\nnothing that they should not and cannot order, and if the officers\r\ncharged with the execution of the orders coöperate to attain the\r\ndesired end, and do not abuse the freedom of action allowed them.\r\n\r\nWhile subordinate leaders, up to and including company commanders,\r\nare mainly occupied with fire control and fire direction, and should\r\ninfluence the men by their personal example, superior commanders have\r\nother tasks, which they must not neglect for the purpose of interfering\r\nin the sphere of action of their subordinates. They can influence the\r\nfire action only by sending the necessary forces to those portions\r\nof the firing line whose fire they wish to augment. An interference\r\non their part with the action of subordinates is permissible only in\r\ncase of obvious misunderstandings or mistakes, which would cause the\r\ncombat to take a course other than that intended. The larger the unit\r\ncommanded by an officer, the greater the latitude that must be allowed\r\nhim. The leaders should concentrate their attention upon the general\r\nexecution of their special tasks as part of the whole scheme, rather\r\nthan upon supervision of details. It is by no means essential for all\r\nparts of the force to employ identical means to attain one and the same\r\nobject. Every leader should bear in mind that _omission or neglect are\r\ngreater crimes than a mistake made in the choice of means_.\r\n\r\nThe initiative of leaders of all grades is the foundation of great\r\nvictories in war, but this initiative must neither jeopardize unity of\r\naction nor direct the course of events into channels not intended by\r\nthe commander.[432]\r\n\r\n    [432] See _Taktik_, III, p. 174, and V, p. 57, et seq.\r\n\r\nThe best safeguard against the results of an act of unjustifiable\r\ninitiative is to ask oneself: “What orders would my superior have to\r\ngive me, if he were in my place and knew what I know?”\r\n\r\n\r\n14. UNITED ACTION VERSUS TACTICAL MISSIONS.\r\n\r\n  Although no one disputes that victory depends upon a superiority of\r\n  fire at the decisive point, yet there is a great diversity of opinion\r\n  as to how this superiority is to be attained.\r\n\r\n  General Bronsart von Schellendorff states:[433] “Every battle seeks\r\n  to bring about a decisive victory, but this is, after all, invariably\r\n  the sum of local victories. Successful battle-tactics consist of\r\n  correctly estimating the tactical value of these local successes\r\n  and of contriving to gain a victory at the decisive point; in other\r\n  words, to manage so that the sum-total of positive factors will be\r\n  greater than that of the negative factors.”\r\n\r\n    [433] _Betrachtungen über die zeitgemäsze Fechtweise der\r\n  Infanterie_, 1891, p. 36.\r\n\r\n  In the opinion of the advocates of this course,[434] unity of action\r\n  is attainable by practice and study, but not by set formations. If\r\n  unity of action could be ensured in all bodies of troops by means\r\n  of study and practice, there would seem to be no reason why the\r\n  regulations should lay down still more definite rules to govern the\r\n  manner in which an attack should be conducted. The matter is not\r\n  so simple, however. Bearing in mind the great latitude that the\r\n  regulations allow each individual in choosing the formation which he\r\n  deems proper in a given case, it is obvious that many very different\r\n  procedures may result. This in itself is no drawback, and to a\r\n  certain extent this condition must exist, as the task in hand, the\r\n  nature of the country, and the existing situation vary. But, if a\r\n  given problem can be correctly solved in several ways, it will also\r\n  admit of a decidedly incorrect solution; and it is the more likely\r\n  to be solved incorrectly, the less study and practice is indulged in\r\n  by a large part of the corps of officers, and the less this class of\r\n  officers finds in existing regulations as a guide to conduct. When,\r\n  in spite of undeniable progress, we see dispersed attacks and an\r\n  unquestionably incorrect conduct in every maneuver, and this with a\r\n  corps of officers nearly all of whom are professional soldiers, who\r\n  have had the advantage of study and practice, what may we expect\r\n  in war, where the corps of officers will be very largely composed\r\n  of officers of the Reserve and Landwehr, who have but very limited\r\n  opportunities for study and practice, but who, after the very first\r\n  battle, may have to command companies.\r\n\r\n    [434] General VON SCHLICHTING, _Taktische und strategische\r\n  Grundsätze der Gegenwart_. See also the essay in the July number of\r\n  _Jahrbücher für Armee und Marine_, 1898.\r\n\r\n  General von Scherff,[435] the chief advocate of “united action,” is\r\n  opposed to the “combat with units of command” (_Kommandoeinheiten_)\r\n  briefly sketched above. He makes a distinction between battle-tactics\r\n  and the tactics of detachment warfare. In his opinion, the sum of\r\n  the local successes can by no means gain the victory; that can only\r\n  be done by the united launching of adequate forces at the decisive\r\n  point. “No weapon in the world will ever alter the fact that five\r\n  battalions united in one body have a greater inherent fighting\r\n  power than five separate battalions--not to mention twenty separate\r\n  companies--always provided that a united body of troops is also\r\n  launched as one body.”\r\n\r\n    [435] _Kriegslehren in Kriegsgeschichtlichen Beispielen der\r\n  Neuzeit_, I-IV, _Ein Schlachtenangriff_, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples Illustrating the Necessity of a United Attack.\r\n\r\n  1. The 26th Infantry Brigade was alarmed and put in march toward the\r\n  battlefield to support the advance guard brigade of the VIIth Army\r\n  Corps, engaged at =Colombey=. The commander of the 26th Infantry\r\n  Brigade received orders from the commanding general to engage. It\r\n  was not necessary for the brigade to provide its own reserve as the\r\n  25th Brigade had been directed to concentrate between Marsilly and\r\n  Colligny, and to be at the disposal of the corps commander. The\r\n  troops already engaged were in a critical situation; their moral and\r\n  physical energy was exhausted. It is only too patent that the first\r\n  battalion (1st Battalion, 13th Infantry) appearing on the scene was\r\n  thrown into the fight to afford at least temporary relief, but this\r\n  insufficient reinforcement was involved in the general failure. After\r\n  about a quarter of an hour, the 25th Brigade (the IIIrd Battallion,\r\n  73rd Infantry had remained in bivouac at Pange) was concentrating\r\n  for action at Coincy, but, instead of its making a united attack,\r\n  only the 1st Battalion of the 73rd Infantry was launched. This\r\n  battalion did, indeed, penetrate into the “Tannenwäldchen” at the\r\n  “Todten-Allee”, but was then surrounded on three sides, had to fall\r\n  back with considerable losses, prevented the further advance of the\r\n  IInd Battallion of the 73rd Infantry, and rallied on the Füsilier\r\n  Battalion of the 13th Infantry, on the bank of the Vallières brook.\r\n  “Although the General Staff account of the war is silent on this\r\n  subject, we are justified in assuming that only the presence of the\r\n  brigade commander, who had learned a lesson from the second local\r\n  assault, prevented the Füsilier Battalion of the 13th Infantry from\r\n  making a fourth isolated effort. After re-forming the organizations,\r\n  the new attack, which was made with indomitable spirit, proceeded\r\n  more in connection with that of three other battalions advancing on\r\n  the same line, and this united advance was closely followed by a\r\n  second echelon consisting of the last battalion of the brigade (the\r\n  IInd Battalion of the 13th Infantry), which had arrived just in time.\r\n  The result was that the enemy was completely routed.”[436]\r\n\r\n    [436] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 470. VON SCHERFF, _Kriegslehren_, I, p.\r\n  41, et seq.\r\n\r\n  2. At the Gorze-Rezonville road, on August 16th, 1870, the isolated\r\n  attacks made against Hill 970 by eight battalions, belonging to three\r\n  different brigades, likewise accomplished nothing, whereas, had a\r\n  higher commander been present, a united attack launched by him would\r\n  undoubtedly have been successful.[437]\r\n\r\n    [437] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 631. VON SCHERFF, _Kriegslehren_, II, p.\r\n  271. KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, 8/9, p. 128, et seq.\r\n\r\n  3. The well executed attack made against the hill west of the suburb\r\n  of =St. Martin=, on January 19th, 1871, by six battalions of the 29th\r\n  Infantry Brigade shows the importance of the united launching of a\r\n  large body of massed infantry. The engagement of the 16th Infantry\r\n  Division, in particular the attack made on =Grugies= (battle of =St.\r\n  Quentin=) is the antithesis of the above-mentioned attack. Although\r\n  the situation did not necessitate the simultaneous launching of the\r\n  available forces, the brigade attacked in driblets. The attack made\r\n  by these fractions, launched one after another, was not able to\r\n  bring about a decision. In the first place, at about 11 A. M., three\r\n  companies (5th, 6th, and 7th of the 69th Infantry), soon afterwards\r\n  supported by the 8th Company of the 29th Infantry, and the 8th\r\n  Company of the 69th Infantry, attacked the French position at the\r\n  railway embankment and cut. The Prussian troops fought with great\r\n  gallantry, the 5th, 6th and 7th Companies of the 69th Infantry making\r\n  four attacks, and the other two companies, three. Although these\r\n  five companies succeeded in gaining temporary successes, they lacked\r\n  a common commander, and were supported from the rear only when they\r\n  were thrown back after fighting for three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\n  About noon, the four companies of the Ist Battalion, 29th Infantry,\r\n  were brought up, but did not engage until the first line had been\r\n  forced back and the 5th, 6th, and 7th Companies of the 69th Infantry,\r\n  at any rate, were out of action for the time being. Incidentally,\r\n  it may be mentioned that the Ist Battalion of the 29th Infantry\r\n  attacked in three groups, the strongest of which consisted of 2-l/2\r\n  companies, the weakest of only half a company. Only the strongest\r\n  of these groups scored a success, and the Ist Battalion of the 29th\r\n  Infantry was completely routed after a bloody fight. The 9th and 10th\r\n  Companies, 29th Infantry, did not arrive on the battlefield until\r\n  after the companies of the Ist Battalion of this regiment, whose\r\n  heroic fight cannot be sufficiently praised, had ceased to exist as\r\n  tactical units.\r\n\r\n  At 12:30 P. M., the 3rd and 4th Companies of the 70th Infantry\r\n  were brought up and threw back the French, but were in their turn\r\n  defeated. At this moment the 10th and 11th Companies of the 40th\r\n  Infantry arrived; these companies were also able to advance, but\r\n  their success was a temporary one only.\r\n\r\n  At 1:30 P. M., the IInd Battalion of the 40th Infantry appeared,\r\n  threw the French back, but was soon attacked by superior forces and\r\n  suffered the same fate as its predecessors.\r\n\r\n  At 2:30 P. M., the Füsilier Battalion of the 70th Infantry and the\r\n  9th and 12th Companies of the 40th Infantry were brought forward, but\r\n  only the former engaged seriously at once--again without success.\r\n  A little while later, the 9th and 12th Companies, 40th Infantry,\r\n  advanced energetically. At about 3:30 P. M., the French made a very\r\n  strong counter-attack; all that had been gained seemed about to\r\n  be lost again, when the decision was finally brought about by the\r\n  vigorous action of the 41st Infantry and a charge made by Reserve\r\n  Dragoons.\r\n\r\n  The capture of Grugies, of the sugar mill, and, a little later, of\r\n  Gauchy, now followed.\r\n\r\n  The resistance of the French was broken. General von Barnekow\r\n  had thus, apparently, gained his object; but at what a price? In\r\n  this engagement, the launching of troops in driblets may be very\r\n  accurately followed:\r\n\r\n  1. At 11 A. M., five companies were launched in two separate groups\r\n  (5th, 6th, and 7th Companies, 69th Infantry--8th Company, 29th\r\n  Infantry and 8th Company, 69th Infantry);\r\n\r\n  2. Toward noon, four fresh companies (1st Battalion, 29th Infantry)\r\n  were also launched in separate groups;\r\n\r\n  3. A little later, two fresh companies were put in (9th and 10th\r\n  Companies, 29th Infantry);\r\n\r\n  4. At 12:30 P. M., two fresh companies were launched (3rd and 4th\r\n  Companies, 70th Infantry);\r\n\r\n  5. A little later, the 10th and 11th Companies, 40th Infantry, were\r\n  pushed in;\r\n\r\n  6. About 1:30 P. M., the IInd Battalion, 40th Infantry, was brought\r\n  up;\r\n\r\n  7. About 2:30 P. M., the Füsilier Battalion, 70th Infantry, and the\r\n  9th and 12th Companies, 40th Infantry, advanced.\r\n\r\n  Thus, between 11 A. M. and 2:30 P. M., General von Barnekow gradually\r\n  drew into the fight twenty-five companies, in seven different\r\n  detachments, from the reserve formed by the 16th Infantry Division\r\n  at Essigny le Grand. Besides, the troops generally did not appear on\r\n  the battlefield until the energy of the troops already engaged was\r\n  exhausted.[438]\r\n\r\n    [438] KUNZ, _Nordarmee_, II, pp. 135 and 212.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, the retreat of the several detachments was not a voluntary\r\n  one, for the French, thanks to their great superiority, generally\r\n  forced them to retire. This engagement thus presents a series of\r\n  partial successes, which became reverses, however, in a very short\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  _Launching reinforcements in driblets increased the numbers required\r\n  beyond all reasonable bounds, produced heavy losses, and involved\r\n  the weak reinforcements, which arrived successively, in disaster,\r\n  without turning the tide of the battle. Decisive victories can only\r\n  be brought about by simultaneously launching masses._\r\n\r\n  “The system of close order battalion tactics was no longer\r\n  practicable under Chassepot fire, and everyone promptly went to the\r\n  opposite extreme of extended order, company column tactics, with\r\n  which all were sufficiently familiar, since it had been carefully\r\n  practiced in minor field exercises in time of peace.” (The attack\r\n  made by the 26th Infantry Brigade against =Schlosz Aubigny=, August\r\n  14th, 1870[439])\r\n\r\n    [439] _Gen. St. W._, I, p. 466; VON SCHERFF, _Kriegslehren_, I, p.\r\n  16; VON MALACHOWSKI, _Scharfe Taktik und Revue-Taktik_, p. 18. This\r\n  example is the more instructive, as both advocates of these opposing\r\n  views show how, in their opinion, the attack should have been made.\r\n  The same attack is, moreover, treated in _Militär-Wochenblatt_,\r\n  1901, Numbers 41 and 42, under the title _Selbständigkeit und\r\n  Auftragsverfahren_.\r\n\r\n  There is always danger that unity of action will be sacrificed by the\r\n  continued assignment of individual tasks; that the leader will not\r\n  be able to count with confidence on the initiative of subordinate\r\n  leaders restoring this unity, and “that, in the end, no higher\r\n  commander will any longer have the assurance that his wishes will\r\n  be carried out.” The battles around Metz during August, 1870, show\r\n  a tendency on the part of the infantry to leave behind, in reserve\r\n  and in rallying positions, parts of the troops launched to perform a\r\n  certain combat task, “to detach parts to maintain communication (very\r\n  often not at all endangered) with neighboring detachments”, and to\r\n  despatch others to a distance to cover a flank, or to make a wide\r\n  turning movement for the purpose of enveloping the enemy’s flank.\r\n\r\n  To prevent a battle from degenerating into a number of disconnected,\r\n  local combats, and to ensure that the enemy will be actually\r\n  subjected to the fire of as many rifles as the supreme commander\r\n  intended, General von Scherff proposes that the battle formation,\r\n  consisting of several echelons separated by fixed distances, be taken\r\n  up outside of the zone of hostile fire, and that these echelons\r\n  then advance simultaneously and as uninterruptedly as possible upon\r\n  the enemy. In this movement the terrain is to be taken advantage of\r\n  only so far as the orders permit. In view of the flat trajectory of\r\n  the modern rifle, he concedes that fire while in motion, formerly\r\n  considered permissible by him at long and medium ranges, may be\r\n  replaced by an advance by rushes of the firing line, alternating\r\n  with firing in a prone position, the ammunition to be expended at\r\n  each halt being fixed by the officer charged with fire direction.\r\n  He moreover considers it necessary to have a main firing position,\r\n  located approximately at the outer limit of short ranges, for the\r\n  purpose of gaining the superiority of fire. Base units must be\r\n  designated in order to prevent weak detachments from encountering the\r\n  enemy single-handed. Moreover, he intends to keep the advance going\r\n  by increasing the fire, and by detailed and definite orders providing\r\n  for the constant reinforcement of the firing line by men of the\r\n  steadily following supports and reserves. Further, since according to\r\n  his proposal, a halt by the rear echelons of an attack that has once\r\n  been launched, is excluded on principle, it follows of necessity,\r\n  that, for the fire effect of the firing line at the really decisive\r\n  ranges, there can remain only a very brief period of time, measurable\r\n  in minutes, which is amply sufficient, in his opinion, for the object\r\n  to be accomplished.\r\n\r\n  It is charged that General von Scherff’s proposal[440] (see p. 205\r\n  supra) favors a set scheme for conducting every fight. This is not\r\n  true; there is quite a difference between “more definitely regulating\r\n  the conduct of an attack”, aimed at by the author of _Kriegslehren_,\r\n  and the formulation of a normal procedure.\r\n\r\n    [440] The 10th Supplement of the _Internationale Revue_ 1900, gives\r\n  General von Scherff’s ideas on the infantry attack. See also his\r\n  _Reglementarische Studien_, p. 58, and _Ein Schlachtenangriff_, p.\r\n  102. _Vergleichender Rückblick auf die neueste Tagesliteratur über\r\n  den Infanterieangriff_, 1906.\r\n\r\n  “Where a number of individuals are to coöperate for the purpose of\r\n  performing a certain task, the nature of the case requires that\r\n  each one be able to picture to himself beforehand the nature of the\r\n  task, so that his share in it will appear clear and definite. Each\r\n  one must know what he is to do, when and where he should engage,\r\n  what his role is to be, etc. etc., or the result will be hopeless\r\n  confusion.”--“The drill regulations must supply this picture and the\r\n  drill-ground is the place where its general forms should be impressed\r\n  upon every individual participating in the performance of a task.”\r\n  Experience has taught us that this image of the drill-ground becomes\r\n  distorted in war through influences which have almost never permitted\r\n  it to appear on the battlefield in its true form. The initiative of\r\n  subordinate leaders should overcome the obstacles which stand in the\r\n  way of a realization of this ideal image.\r\n\r\n  =The system of tactical missions= reckons with the sum-total of local\r\n  successes, assigns tasks to the different units of command, and\r\n  leaves to the latter the choice of the means, without restricting\r\n  their independence. The course of the combat can be influenced only\r\n  by the action of retained forces, and it is sought to produce united\r\n  action by acquainting all leaders with the object of the combat, they\r\n  in turn endeavoring to attain this object even though they do so in\r\n  different ways.\r\n\r\n  =The system of united action= seeks to ensure victory by\r\n  simultaneously placing in readiness all the forces intended for\r\n  the general combat, by an orderly concentration for action, and by\r\n  launching the troops at one and the same time, without, however,\r\n  requiring all parts of the force to employ the same formations. This\r\n  system dictates to the leader the number of troops he should launch.\r\n  Since in action everything is ordered as necessity therefor arises,\r\n  the result is that the leader loses sight of the general action in\r\n  view of the great number of separate orders that must be issued.\r\n\r\n  In the system of tactical missions, there is danger of arbitrary\r\n  action on the part of subordinates, and of dispersion; moreover,\r\n  it is not always easy to deploy strong firing lines, and there is\r\n  an increased tendency to overestimate the value of cover and, in\r\n  consequence, to overstep the assigned frontage.\r\n\r\n  The system of united action is open to the objection that initiative\r\n  of the individual disappears and that the rules laid down in drill\r\n  regulations degenerate into a pattern devoid of all spirit.\r\n\r\n  In =Austria= (1906), Captain Wachtel[441] suggests that, when a\r\n  decision is not sought, an attack in groups be made, and that, when a\r\n  decision is sought, a united attack be made. In =Switzerland=, Major\r\n  Sonderegger[442] advocates a procedure based on that of General von\r\n  Scherff.\r\n\r\n    [441] _Gruppen- und Einheitsangriff_.\r\n\r\n    [442] _Der ungebremste Infanterieangriff_, 1906.\r\n\r\n  The initiative of the individual should carry the troops over\r\n  difficulties occasioned by the terrain or the enemy. Such checks\r\n  occur most frequently from the time a force enters the zone of\r\n  effective hostile fire until the assault has been decided upon. In\r\n  the author’s opinion, the individualized attack is a concession made,\r\n  at the expense of united action, for the purpose of making the attack\r\n  succeed at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THE DEFENSE.[443]\r\n\r\n    [443] _Taktik_, V, p. 308. HOPPENSTEDT, _Taktisches Handbuch für\r\n  den Infanterieoffizier_, p. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invariable guiding principle in defense is to make the most\r\nprofitable use of fire. This principle governs in the selection of a\r\nposition and in strengthening it artificially.\r\n\r\nThe defender’s object may be--\r\n\r\n1. =Temporary occupation= of a piece of ground;\r\n\r\n2. =Purely passive defense=, outpost, rear guard, and delaying actions;\r\n\r\n3. =Offensive-defensive action=, _i.e._, to bring about a decision by\r\ncombining the offensive with the defensive.\r\n\r\nIn fortress warfare, situations may arise which may make it necessary\r\nto hold a piece of ground obstinately, without it being possible to\r\nassume the offensive. In the French, Russian, and Italian regulations,\r\nonly the offensive-defensive is considered. The Italians see in the\r\ndefensive nothing but a preparation for the offensive; the Russians\r\nseek to shake the enemy with fire in defense, so that they can\r\nsubsequently assume the offensive.\r\n\r\nThe defensive is dependent upon the terrain, and is subject to the\r\ncondition that the locality where the tactical situation requires\r\na stand to be made offers a position favorable for employing fire\r\nto good advantage, and that the opponent actually attacks where the\r\ndefender expects him. The employment of the defensive is restricted\r\nby its dependence on the ground and on the measures of the enemy. Its\r\nemployment may frequently be explained by the fact that one of the\r\ncontending parties allows itself to be checked to such an extent by the\r\ninitiative of the other that it can only offer a passive resistance.\r\nSuch passive resistance may here and there score a success by chance\r\n(Plevna, St. Privat), but, as a rule, only the assailant reaps a\r\nbenefit from such situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE PASSIVE DEFENSE\r\n\r\nseeks to avoid a decision, and must therefore endeavor, by opening fire\r\nat an early moment, to prevent the enemy from reaching short ranges.\r\n(See p. 147 supra). It is not absolutely necessary to have a clear\r\nfield of fire or strong reserves, but the latter, kept a considerable\r\ndistance in rear, must be strong enough to enable the force to\r\ndisengage itself from the enemy.\r\n\r\nSince only a temporary resistance is to be made, it is permissible for\r\nthe force to cover a greater front. The defender should endeavor to\r\ncompensate for his numerical inferiority by expending a large amount of\r\nammunition and by employing machine guns. It is an advantage to have\r\nobstacles in front of the position and cover in rear of it, because the\r\nformer retard the enemy’s advance and the latter shelters the troops\r\nfrom his fire in case of a retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE DEFENSE SEEKING A DECISION.[444]\r\n\r\n    [444] During the attack on the large work at Gorni Dubniac, the\r\n  Finnland Regiment was unable to advance from its last position, only\r\n  70-100 paces distant from the enemy, over the foreground swept by\r\n  grazing fire. Several attempted assaults were repulsed.\r\n\r\nDecisive results can only be obtained at short and medium ranges. Long\r\nrange fire may, indeed, inflict losses on the enemy and delay his\r\nadvance, but it cannot repulse him. (See p. 148 supra).\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient merely to ward off the attack with fire; the\r\noffensive must be assumed. When this is not done, the assailant can\r\nrepair his losses and try another attack. When the defender has\r\nrepulsed the enemy, he should follow up this success with an attack.\r\nHowever, as he will rarely be able to do this with the force at his\r\ndisposal, fresh troops will be required. (Beaune la Rolande, Lisaine).\r\nThe change from the tactical defensive to the offensive offers the same\r\ndifficulties as the corresponding strategical move; but, in the former\r\ncase, there is present, in addition, the element of danger and the\r\ndifficulty of perceiving the right moment.[445]\r\n\r\n    [445] _Taktik_, V, p. 320. Compare this with Benedeck’s hesitation\r\n  at Königgrätz.\r\n\r\nA position is of value only when it compels the enemy to attack,\r\ndirects his movements into definite channels, and induces him to make\r\nwide turning movements, which cause him to lose time and produce\r\nfavorable conditions for the assumption of the offensive on the part\r\nof the defender. Every position that enables the defender to use all\r\nhis weapons, and does not deter the enemy from making an attack, is\r\nsuitable for this purpose.\r\n\r\n“By placing our troops in an unassailable position, we actually refuse\r\nbattle and force the enemy to seek the decision in another manner.\r\n* * * A defensive position approaches its ideal to the extent that\r\nits strength is hidden and opportunity is offered of surprising the\r\nenemy by our tactical combinations. One should endeavor to conceal\r\nthe advantages which one intends to derive from the formation of the\r\nground, just as one hides from the enemy the bulk of one’s troops and\r\ntheir actual position. This is, indeed, only practicable to a certain\r\nextent, and requires perhaps a peculiar and little used method of\r\ntreatment.”[446]\r\n\r\n    [446] CLAUSEWITZ, _On War_, VI, 12 (_Militär-Klassiker_, p.\r\n  364). The Boers were masters of the art of concealing defensive\r\n  positions. At Colenso, on the Modder River, and at Magersfontain,\r\n  their positions were located in places where neither the British\r\n  artillerists nor the reconnoitering detachments suspected them to be.\r\n\r\nModern firearms make the defense so strong in front that it suffices to\r\nhold this part of the position with a weak force supplied with plenty\r\nof ammunition, and provided with weak supports, at a few points, to\r\nreplace losses. As these supports have a definite task to perform, they\r\nare posted as near the first line as the available cover permits, in\r\norder to cut down the distance to be traversed by them under fire.\r\nWhen practicable, they are intrenched within the firing line itself. As\r\nit is advisable to supply these troops with a great deal of ammunition,\r\nsome of the ammunition wagons belonging to the battalions held in\r\nreserve may be turned over to them. The general reserve intended for\r\noffensive action should be kept far in rear of the line. When kept too\r\nclose to the first line, the defender will be unable to move it to any\r\npoint desired, after the direction of the attack becomes apparent.\r\nThe defender should examine his position from the point of view of\r\nthe attacker, and ask himself, “_With how weak a force may I occupy\r\nthe position and still obtain the frontal strength described in the\r\nregulations, and how strong can I make the general reserve so as to\r\nbring about a decision?_”\r\n\r\nAt some parts of the position, an attack will have good prospects of\r\nsucceeding, at others it would encounter difficulties, and, finally,\r\nat others it could not possibly succeed. While many troops are needed\r\nin the first-mentioned portions (sections), comparatively few troops\r\nwill suffice to hold those sections which are less favorable for\r\nthe attacker (on account of their free field of fire, obstacles,\r\nand the absence of artillery positions in which the attacker can\r\nplace his guns). This leads to a division of the defensive position\r\ninto sections, each forming a separate unit of command (battalion\r\nor company) and, when necessary, detailing its own reserve (section\r\nreserve). When the frontage of the sections, as determined by the\r\nabove-mentioned examination of the position, is considerable, or when\r\nobstacles lie within the position, a further subdivision may become\r\nnecessary. This does not imply that the position must be held in\r\nequal strength all along the line; portions of the line that are very\r\ndifficult to attack need only be kept under observation. Gaps in the\r\ndefensive line are, as a rule, of very little value to the assailant,\r\nas the defender will frequently be able to sweep the space in front of\r\nthem from a flank. “In order to keep all parts of the foreground under\r\nobservation, and to prevent portions of the hostile force from escaping\r\nthe defender’s fire, a division of the foreground corresponding to the\r\ndivision into sections must be made when necessary.” (Par. 403 German\r\nI. D. R.).\r\n\r\nWeak points, _i.e._, points against which the assailant can suddenly\r\nmass superior forces at short range, or in the defense of which a\r\ncoöperation of infantry and artillery is impossible, must be specially\r\nstrengthened: by obstacles; provision for flanking the hostile advance;\r\nand preparation of supporting points in rear of the position. In\r\naddition, such weak points must be occupied with a strong garrison, by\r\nemploying two firing lines, one above the other; reserves; and machine\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nEnclosed farm yards (Point du Jour, on August 18th, 1870), and small\r\npatches of timber, are best not occupied at all; they are far more\r\nvaluable as sham defenses in that they draw the fire of the assailant.\r\nAt any rate, it is a question whether, at the last moment, when the\r\nhostile assault must be warded off, it will be possible to occupy such\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, only a single defensive position, consisting of an\r\ninfantry and an artillery line, is selected.\r\n\r\n  The Russians invariably posted strong advanced detachments in front\r\n  of their main defensive positions. As a result, the most serious\r\n  fights usually occurred in the positions taken up by these advanced\r\n  troops.[447] At =Haicheng=, for example, a strong main position had\r\n  been prepared, in which a stand was to be made. In spite of this,\r\n  the IInd Siberian Corps was left in a strongly fortified advanced\r\n  position west of =Simutcheng=. This corps, in its turn, fortified two\r\n  lines of advanced positions far in its front.\r\n\r\n    [447] LÖFFLER, _Russisch-japanischer Krieg_, I, p. 109. See\r\n  _Taktik_, V, p. 305, in regard to the numerous positions in the\r\n  valley of the Shaho.\r\n\r\n  “Thus, on July 31, 1904, only seven battalions of this corps finally\r\n  fought at =Daputsi= and =Liadapu=. When they were thrown back by\r\n  superior forces, the mistake was made of bringing up fresh troops\r\n  to regain the position captured by the enemy. These troops arrived\r\n  too late and had to make a difficult attack on the Japanese, who\r\n  had already occupied the captured position. Naturally their frontal\r\n  attack accomplished nothing.\r\n\r\n  “The force thus suffered a defeat needlessly, and, although the\r\n  defensive had been decided upon, a lot of men were sacrificed in an\r\n  attempt to retake an advanced position that had been captured by the\r\n  enemy. The corps evacuated its strong position without a fight when\r\n  its line of retreat was endangered by Mistshenko’s being forced back.\r\n  The Russians likewise evacuated their main position at Haicheng when\r\n  news was received that strong hostile forces were advancing against\r\n  the left flank of the position.”[448]\r\n\r\n    [448] See _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 41/42, p. 49.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it is not advisable to occupy =advanced positions=,[449]\r\n_i.e._, positions lying within effective range of the main position.\r\nSupporting points immediately in front of the main position, projecting\r\nfrom it like caponiers, and flanking the ground over which the\r\nassailant will have to make his attack, must not be confounded with\r\nthese advanced positions. St. Hubert and St. Marie aux Chênes, on\r\nthe battlefield of Gravelotte are good examples of both classes of\r\npositions. In order to gain time, a commander may sometimes find it\r\nadvantageous to occupy and temporarily defend advanced positions lying\r\nstill farther to the front. (Lisaine, and Shaho). In doing this,\r\nfavorable terrain (Chavannes on the Lisaine) and skillful leadership\r\nare essential.\r\n\r\n    [449] _Taktik_, V, p. 270, et seq. No objection can be made to\r\n  the contemplated construction of advanced positions in front of\r\n  the Shaho position, as the Russians desired to gain time for the\r\n  offensive movement to be made by their left wing. The uncertainty\r\n  and hesitation produced by the constant changes in orders, and the\r\n  excessive reinforcement of the advanced detachments, which allowed\r\n  themselves to be led into making a stubborn defense, was fatal.\r\n\r\n  In =France= and =Russia= much is expected of advanced positions.\r\n  In =England= particular importance is attached to them when they\r\n  draw the enemy in a direction facilitating the conduct of a\r\n  counter-attack. The British consider that supporting points lying in\r\n  front of the position had best be left unoccupied, unless they can be\r\n  supported by artillery fire from the main position.\r\n\r\n  “Smokeless powder and the great range of modern firearms will\r\n  frequently make reconnaissance so difficult that it will be possible\r\n  to gain an approximate idea of the enemy’s strength only by a fight.\r\n  For this reason, in situations similar to that existing west of\r\n  Belfort, in January 1871, advanced detachments, whose mission it is\r\n  to deceive the enemy as to the defender’s strength, and to compel\r\n  him to deploy, will have a greater justification now than at that\r\n  time. Nowadays, such detachments may cover a considerable front\r\n  without danger, especially when they are plentifully supplied with\r\n  ammunition. This will make it still more easy to deceive the enemy,\r\n  and a skillful defender will know how to make the most of it.”[450]\r\n\r\n    [450] _Studien zur Kriegsgeschichte und Taktik_, II, p. 237.\r\n\r\nAdvanced positions[451] are apt to mask the fire from the main\r\nposition, and fights for their possession may easily lead to the defeat\r\nof the troops holding them. The danger of the fight taking place and\r\nbeing decided in the advanced position must be reckoned with. (Battles\r\nof Ligny and on the Hallue). On the other hand, it may be advantageous\r\nto employ scouting detachments, cyclists, and machine guns, and to\r\nconstruct dummy intrenchments in front of the main position. (Par. 407\r\nGerman I. D. R.). The French, more than anyone else, are convinced of\r\nthe advantages to be derived from an employment of advanced positions\r\n(for example in deceiving the enemy as to the location of the main\r\nposition). In a deliberately planned concentration and advance into\r\naction, such positions are, however, so effectively enveloped that\r\nthey do not come into play at all and fall an easy prey to the enemy.\r\nHowever, we do not wish to deny their occasional usefulness in\r\ncases where it is necessary to gain time for concentration and for\r\nstrengthening the main position. In fights for their possession, an\r\nidea may frequently be gained of the intentions and dispositions of the\r\nassailant. Moreover, they offer opportunities for surprising the enemy\r\nwith fire, and induce him to make premature attacks and to mass his\r\ntroops in the ones he has captured.\r\n\r\n    [451] Par. 21 German _Manual of Field Engineering_: “Their use is\r\n  principally restricted to special cases in fortress warfare.”\r\n\r\nNext to a free field of fire (clearing the foreground, and ascertaining\r\nranges), the determining factors in selecting a position are elbow room\r\nin and in rear of the position, supporting points for the flanks, and\r\ncover. The natural cover available on the ground is made use of as best\r\nsuits the purpose of the action.\r\n\r\nThe line in which the artillery intends to fight the decisive action\r\nconstitutes the “framework” of the position. Although artillery will\r\nrarely be able to perform all its tasks in a single position, its first\r\nposition is selected with due regard to the position of the hostile\r\nartillery. The most important position is that from which the hostile\r\ninfantry attack is to be repulsed. This should be selected far enough\r\nin front of the artillery to enable the latter to fire over it, and to\r\ndeprive the assailant’s artillery of the opportunity of hitting the\r\ndefender’s infantry and artillery at one and the same time. (Par. 401\r\nGerman I. D. R.). A distance of 600 m. between infantry and artillery\r\nis considered sufficient for this purpose. In view of the protection\r\nafforded by gun shields against infantry fire, it is scarcely necessary\r\nto post skirmish lines in advance of the artillery. But, where the\r\ninfantry line is not continuous in front of the artillery, troops\r\nshould be posted, so as to protect the artillery personnel from\r\nbeing annoyed by hostile patrols. It will seldom be possible for a\r\ncommander to do justice to the requirements of both arms; in every\r\ncompromise, one or the other arm is only too apt to be placed at a\r\ndisadvantage. The needs of the infantry, whose choice of a position is\r\nmore restricted, take precedence. While infantry can govern its action\r\nby that of the artillery during the preparatory stage of an attack,\r\nthis is impossible in defense, as the infantry is obliged to carry the\r\nfight through to its logical conclusion in the position in which it is\r\nbegun.[452]\r\n\r\n    [452] As the artillery is less restricted in the choice of\r\n  positions, and as the final outcome of the fight depends, after all,\r\n  on the outcome of the infantry action, the demands of the infantry,\r\n  contrary to par. 292 German I. D. R., must be considered in the first\r\n  place.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. FORTIFYING THE POSITION.[453]\r\n\r\n    [453] Germany: _Manual of Field Engineering_, 1905. France:\r\n  _Instruction pratique sur les travaux de campagne_ (December 24th,\r\n  1906). England: _Manual of Military Engineering_, 1905. Russia:\r\n  _Mitteilungen vom Ingenieur Comité_, No. 41 (1906). The Austrian and\r\n  Italian regulations are undergoing revision.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions formerly entertained in regard to prematurely\r\nfortifying a position, and which are still shared by the French\r\nregulations, are no longer to be found in the new regulations. The\r\nconstruction of field fortifications requires time, if they are to be\r\nof value, and if they are to give leaders and troops the assurance\r\nthat they can be defended by the minimum number of men.[454] Even\r\nintrenchments that have been constructed in vain will frequently prove\r\nuseful in deceiving the enemy. In many cases, it will be necessary to\r\nbe prepared to meet a hostile attack made from several directions. This\r\ncontingency should be taken into account by at least preparing for the\r\nwork beforehand.\r\n\r\n    [454] At 10 A. M., on August 18th, 1870. General Canrobert received\r\n  orders to place St. Privat in a state of defense. At 11 A. M., the\r\n  first reports of the approach of the Prussian Guard were received,\r\n  and at 4 P. M., Ste. Marie aux Chênes was in German hands. Hence,\r\n  only five hours were available for these preparations for defense.\r\n\r\n“If the situation turns out to be different than was expected, the\r\nintrenchments already constructed should not influence the decisions\r\nof the commander. On the other hand, the consideration that the works\r\nmight be built unnecessarily must not cause their construction to be\r\nomitted altogether.” (Par. 311 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n  In the preface to the French regulations, it is emphasized that\r\n  intrenching a position ought neither to impair the spirit of the\r\n  offensive nor hamper the movement to the front. “Intrenchments are\r\n  a means to an end, but not the end itself. They should only be used\r\n  when no violence is done thereby to the tactical situation, and one\r\n  should never hesitate, for a single moment, to abandon them, if the\r\n  situation requires, or to construct others, at another place, if it\r\n  becomes necessary.” The men should therefore be trained in handling\r\n  the portable intrenching tools, until they can use them skillfully in\r\n  any position of the body.\r\n\r\n  “The use of intrenchments may also be abused. To remain inertly\r\n  in a place is just as fatal as to advance without making use of\r\n  cover. When temporary halts are made, the commander for the time\r\n  being, often placed in that position by chance (_chef du moment,\r\n  chef d’unité ou chef de groupe éventuel_), indicates whether or not\r\n  intrenchments are to be constructed.”\r\n\r\n  Battle intrenchments are to protect the soldier against hostile\r\n  fire, without hampering him in using his rifle. “They are one of\r\n  the factors which ensure economy in men, in that they save a body\r\n  of troops from suffering unnecessary losses. But their importance\r\n  always recedes before the general requirements of an action, and they\r\n  should never in any way interfere with the advance of troops; on the\r\n  contrary, intrenchments are to make it possible to bring troops\r\n  within effective range of the enemy, without impairing their physical\r\n  condition or their morale.”\r\n\r\nIntrenchments enable a commander to save troops, which he can use\r\noffensively at the decisive point. They do not fulfill the object\r\nfor which they were intended, when they make it easier for the enemy\r\nto pick out the position. “Works which cannot be perceived from the\r\nforeground even through powerful field glasses, afford the most\r\neffective protection against artillery fire.” Trenches should therefore\r\nbe deep, have a low parapet, and be properly masked.\r\n\r\nThe commander indicates when work is to begin. Every unit must intrench\r\nthe portion of the defensive line which it is to defend; working\r\nparties, specially detailed from troops not intended for the immediate\r\ndefense of the position, can be counted on only when extensive works\r\nare to be constructed.\r\n\r\nContinuous lines of trenches are seldom built; it suffices to construct\r\na line of works with intervals, _i.e._, battalion groups, the intervals\r\nbeing simply held by a weak force.\r\n\r\nThese battalion groups (par. 24 German Manual of Field Engineering)\r\nare constructed without regard to any fixed form, as the tactical\r\nemployment of the companies requires. They consist of firing trenches\r\n(flanks refused and echelons in rear of the wings), provided with\r\nsplinter proofs, and adequate cover trenches, so that all the men, if\r\npossible, will be sheltered from artillery fire.\r\n\r\nThe aim is, first of all, to construct inconspicuous standing firing\r\ntrenches. These should have low parapets and be provided with numerous\r\ntraverses to restrict the effect of high explosive shell. In order\r\nthat these traverses may not betray the location of the position, they\r\nshould not rise above the parapet.[455]\r\n\r\n    [455] These traverses afford very little shelter against enfilading\r\n  fire; it is advisable to keep sand bags in readiness as a protection\r\n  in case such fire is received.\r\n\r\nDeep, narrow trenches afford the best protection against artillery\r\nfire (the trench should be about 0.60 m. wide at the bottom). Narrow\r\ntrenches are especially difficult to pick out from a balloon. In\r\nconstructing trenches having no parapet at all, special precautions\r\nmust be taken in order that their location may not be betrayed by the\r\nscattered earth or by their rear wall, which will be visible when they\r\nare located on the slope facing the enemy. When the trenches are to\r\nbe held for some time, provision must be made for the construction\r\nof splinter proofs,[456] other overhead cover, and loopholes of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n    [456] These lie about 0.50 m. below the natural surface of the\r\n  ground and accommodate 5-6 men: they are separated from each other by\r\n  an earth wall 1 m. thick.\r\n\r\nNumerous light splinter proofs are generally to be preferred to a\r\nfew larger and stronger ones, as they afford sufficient protection\r\nagainst shrapnel bullets and fragments. They may be protected against\r\ndirect hits from field guns, or other guns having a flat trajectory,\r\nby sloping their roofs to the rear at an angle as nearly as possible\r\ncoincident with the angle of fall of those projectiles.\r\n\r\nSince field intrenchments are incapable of furnishing protection\r\nagainst direct hits from guns having a curved trajectory, this object\r\nmust be attained by skillfully distributing splinter proofs along the\r\nfront. These should be inconspicuous and should not take up too much\r\nroom. The comfort of the troops in the trenches should also be provided\r\nfor by constructing kitchens, latrines, drainage ditches, and dressing\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, field magazines for storing ammunition should be built,\r\nand alarm arrangements made. Moreover, covered communication should be\r\nprovided along the line and to the rear. The front and gaps in the line\r\nmay be very effectively flanked by fire from skillfully constructed\r\nrefused wings.\r\n\r\nIn constructing a battalion group of intrenchments, provision will have\r\nto be made, in addition, for the following:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Intrenchments for a Battalion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Firing Trench with Cover Trench.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Firing Trench with Splinter Proofs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profiles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Firing Trench in ordinary soil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Splinter Proof.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Communicating Trench.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Communicating Trench without Parapet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Machine Gun Pit.]\r\n\r\n1. =Observation of the foreground=, “for the purpose of reconnaissance\r\nand security, as well as for noting the effect of one’s own fire.” In\r\norder that observers may not betray the location of the position, it\r\nis recommended that they be posted at inconspicuous points affording\r\na sufficiently extended view, and screened from the observation of\r\nthe enemy. When they have to be posted in the defensive line, the\r\nterreplein is either lowered in places, so that they can just look over\r\nthe parapet, or special observation stations are constructed. Provision\r\nmust be made for communication between the several parts of the line\r\nand with the next higher headquarters.\r\n\r\n2. =Clearing the foreground.= As a rule, it will be practicable to\r\nemploy for this work troops not needed in digging trenches. As time\r\nis lacking in field warfare for extensive work, such as cutting down\r\nembankments and removing dead angles, one will have to be content with\r\ntrampling down or burning standing grain, removing objects which the\r\nenemy might use as aiming points, and cutting clearings through woods.\r\nIt is not advisable to demolish stone walls and houses, as the debris\r\nis difficult to remove and affords cover to the enemy.\r\n\r\n3. =Dummy intrenchments and masks.=[457] These are to deceive the\r\nassailant as to the position and extent of the defensive works.\r\nThey should not be located in the same fire swept zone as the\r\ndefensive works themselves, and at a distance should look like real\r\nfortifications. Masks are to screen defensive works or troops, without\r\nrestricting the fire of the latter. Natural features are best suited\r\nfor this purpose, but may be replaced or supplemented by artificial\r\nmasks.\r\n\r\n    [457] _Taktik_, V, p. 291. At Magersfontain, the Boers constructed\r\n  dummy trenches on the crest, while the trenches actually held by them\r\n  were located at the foot of the slope. The result is well known.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, it will suffice to place a few skirmishers behind a\r\nparapet that has been hastily thrown up with a plow.\r\n\r\n4. =Cover trenches and communicating trenches.= These constitute a\r\nconsiderable portion of the defensive works. Communicating trenches\r\nmay be either covered ways or zigzags, and connect the cover trenches\r\nwith the firing trenches. Sortie steps should be provided in order to\r\nfacilitate a prompt advance from the trenches. In many cases, it is\r\nimpossible to avoid placing firing and cover trenches so close to each\r\nother that the enemy’s shells can strike both simultaneously.\r\n\r\n5. =Obstacles.= These need only be constructed when two forces confront\r\neach other for a protracted period. The purpose of obstacles is to hold\r\nthe enemy where he will be exposed to the most deadly fire; retard his\r\nadvance; compel him to confine his movements to certain avenues of\r\napproach (this is especially valuable in night combats); and eliminate\r\ndead angles in front of the position. The presence of extensive\r\nobstacles forces the enemy to advance systematically. As a rule, they\r\ncan only be removed by pioneers. They should not be located too near\r\nthe position, as they are apt to be damaged by artillery fire directed\r\nat the position, and interfere with the defender’s fire. When they\r\nare too far in front of the position, the defender will not be able\r\nto guard them and prevent their destruction. In general, they should\r\nnot be more than 200 m. from the position. It is better to construct\r\nseveral lines of small obstacles than a single line of large ones. The\r\nrequirement that obstacles must not interfere with the defender’s fire,\r\nmust not afford the enemy an opportunity to approach under cover, and\r\nmust remain intact under hostile artillery fire, is best met by marshy\r\nground and by wire entanglements. Obstacles should be provided with a\r\nslight glacis in order to prevent artillery fire from destroying them\r\nprematurely. When wire entanglements are too high, they are easily seen\r\nat a distance, and, although they are little damaged by artillery fire,\r\nthe attacker can make preparations to remove them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRussian Views.\r\n\r\n  A defensive position consists of an advanced position, a fighting\r\n  line with firing trenches and batteries, supporting points in rear,\r\n  and, finally, a fourth line, which serves as a rallying position.\r\n  The key to a position, which lay formerly in the line of supporting\r\n  points, lies at present in the firing trenches in which supporting\r\n  points must be provided. (Colonel Golenkin advocates the use of\r\n  semi-circular works as supporting points, and Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n  Mordovin large closed works). “These semi-circular works are in\r\n  a sense the anchors by means of which the firing line clings to\r\n  the position which it has occupied.” It does not matter if the\r\n  enemy penetrates the first line and captures one or two of these\r\n  supporting points, for others remain on either side; the latter and\r\n  the second line of supporting points then form a new though somewhat\r\n  indented defensive line. As the attacking force which has penetrated\r\n  into the position, is hemmed in on both sides, it will hardly be able\r\n  to sustain the counter-attack made by the defender’s reserves, and\r\n  its temporary success will turn into defeat. But, in order that this\r\n  may be accomplished, a second line of supporting points is absolutely\r\n  essential. Large closed works of high command, but a smaller number\r\n  than is employed in the first line, are recommended for this purpose.\r\n  According to Russian opinions, several lines of fortifications are\r\n  essential in order to check an enemy who has penetrated the first\r\n  line, and to facilitate the defender’s final retreat in case of\r\n  necessity.\r\n\r\n  Particular importance is attached to advanced positions, to positions\r\n  for the reserves, echeloned to the right and left rear of the flanks,\r\n  and, finally, to rallying positions. Advanced positions are either\r\n  to serve “reconnaissance purposes,” by forcing the enemy to an early\r\n  deployment, or to do duty as “caponiers” from which a flanking fire\r\n  may be brought to bear on the foreground.\r\n\r\n  Advanced positions, doing duty as “caponiers,” are invariably to\r\n  consist of closed works, those serving “reconnaissance purposes” of\r\n  open works. The latter are to be defended “to the last ditch,” and\r\n  are not to be evacuated until the enemy approaches to about 400 m. or\r\n  less, but the garrison is not to allow itself to become involved in a\r\n  bayonet fight.\r\n\r\n  In contrast with this distribution in depth--2 km., in the model\r\n  given--Lieutenant-Colonel Jabel, whose views are based on the same\r\n  experiences, advocates the use of only one line of fortifications. He\r\n  states: “The length of the battles, which sometimes lasted two weeks,\r\n  as well as the terrible intensity of fire in general and artillery\r\n  fire in particular, produced such an absolute nervous exhaustion that\r\n  the decisive action could be fought only in a single line. With its\r\n  capture, further fighting had only small prospects of success * * *”\r\n  “When firing trenches have been constructed at the points where the\r\n  best effect can be obtained from long and short range fire, they\r\n  should not be evacuated prematurely, but held, in order to make the\r\n  most of this fire effect, until the enemy arrives close enough to use\r\n  his bayonets. If the troops holding the trenches retire immediately\r\n  before the bayonet fight, their retreat invariably becomes a rout,\r\n  and, in any case, entails tremendous losses, for, after leaving\r\n  their trenches, they will be helpless and exposed in the open to the\r\n  hostile fire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE CONDUCT OF THE DEFENSE.\r\n\r\nIn his _Tactical Handbook_, Major Hoppenstedt suggests a method,\r\nwell meriting attention, for decreasing the effect of artillery fire\r\non a defensive position. He believes that dummy intrenchments, not\r\ntoo conspicuously located, partially, but not skillfully masked and\r\noccupied, will deceive the attacker’s artillery for some time, at any\r\nrate, until the advanced troops of the attacker induce the defenders to\r\nman their parapet and expose themselves to shrapnel fire. The “defense\r\nshould be conducted in such a manner that the garrison of the main\r\nposition will not need to expose itself to the enemy’s artillery fire\r\nas soon as his advanced troops appear.” Major Hoppenstedt believes that\r\nthis can be attained, in hill positions, by conducting the fire fight,\r\nat long and medium ranges, from positions in rear, the defender moving\r\nup into the main position, specially prepared for this purpose, when\r\nthe attacker disappears in the defiladed spaces in front of it. The\r\nobjection to this method is that it necessitates too large a force to\r\nhold the position.\r\n\r\n  “In a protracted, obstinate fight, the defender’s trenches,\r\n  exposed to the combined hostile infantry and artillery fire, will\r\n  finally become filled with dead and wounded, and it will rarely\r\n  be practicable to remove them. The arrival of reinforcements will\r\n  increase the confusion and the losses, and the fighting energy of the\r\n  troops will decrease with tremendous rapidity. This is one of the\r\n  greatest disadvantages of the defense as compared with the attack and\r\n  its constantly moving lines.\r\n\r\n  “In such cases, which will be typical at points where the attacker\r\n  intends to penetrate the line, it may be a real act of salvation for\r\n  the defender’s firing line to rush to the front.\r\n\r\n  “In fighting at short ranges, especially just before the assailant\r\n  makes his assault, such a rush to the front on the part of the\r\n  defender’s line, may be a good move for another reason. As is well\r\n  known, the attacker’s artillery must change targets when its infantry\r\n  arrives within a certain distance of the defender’s position. The\r\n  Germans (par. 446 I. D. R.) fix this point at 300 m. from the enemy,\r\n  and the French, whose guns have a flatter trajectory, fix it at 500\r\n  m. In attacking a hill position, when the fire is well observed, the\r\n  distance of this point from the position will be considerably greater.\r\n\r\n  “But, no matter where the actual location of this point may be,\r\n  skillful infantry will start its assault very close to the point\r\n  fixed by the regulations, and never beyond it, so as to avoid\r\n  interfering with the fire of its artillery. Under such circumstances,\r\n  it may be a skillful move for a defender who is still full of fight,\r\n  to decrease the distance which separates him from the hostile\r\n  infantry, in order that, by so doing, he may escape from the hostile\r\n  artillery fire and from the smoke which obscures his vision. If he\r\n  finds cover farther to the front, so much the better, for he will\r\n  then have that much of an advantage over the attacker.”\r\n\r\nThe weakness of most defensive positions lies in the danger of a sudden\r\nattack being directed against a flank. The assailant will endeavor to\r\navoid making an attack against the front of a position prepared for\r\ndefense, when such an attack has small chances of succeeding, and seek\r\nthe decision by attacking a flank, where conditions are, to a certain\r\nextent at least, equalized. The danger of a flank attack increases\r\nwith the length of the defensive line. It is by no means a good move\r\nto prolong the threatened wing (French VIth Army Corps at St. Privat)\r\nfor the purpose of warding off an envelopment. The power of extension\r\nis bound to reach a limit sooner or later, and the wing attacked will\r\nthen be so weak and attenuated that it will not be capable of offering\r\nserious resistance.\r\n\r\nTo ward off an employment by refusing a flank likewise promises little\r\nsuccess. The enemy’s superiority of fire will make itself felt,\r\nfirst of all, at the salient thus formed (see p. 357 supra), and his\r\nconvergent artillery and infantry fire, which may even enfilade parts\r\nof the line, will paralyze all tactical movements of the defender at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nBy prolonging the line and by refusing a flank, we only postpone\r\nthe decision a little while, but cannot effectively cope with an\r\nenvelopment. This must be accomplished in a different manner.\r\n\r\nThe best scheme would be to flank the enemy’s enveloping force by\r\nposting an echelon in a suitable position, or to bring about a decision\r\nby employing the reserve offensively. However, for carrying out these\r\nmeasures, more time is required than for merely refusing a flank. Time\r\nmay be gained by making an extensive reconnaissance on the flanks with\r\nstrong detachments, and by occupying supporting points lying on the\r\nflanks, which the enemy would have to take before he could think of\r\nattacking the main position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn employing machine guns in defense, it should be borne in mind that\r\nthey are unsuited for carrying on protracted fire fights, and that the\r\nmobility of the machine gun batteries cannot be utilized when, from the\r\nvery start, they are assigned a section to defend.\r\n\r\nIn general, it will be advisable in defense to keep the machine\r\nguns at first with the reserve, and to employ them, when necessary,\r\nto reinforce the defensive line at threatened points, to prevent\r\nenvelopment, to repulse an assault, or to participate in an offensive\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThis does not preclude their coming into action at the very opening of\r\nan engagement, for instance, where it is necessary to command important\r\navenues of approach.\r\n\r\nWhen a withdrawal under cover is assured, it will also be possible to\r\npost machine gun batteries in such a manner, in front or on a flank of\r\nthe main position, that they can bring a sudden fire to bear on the\r\narea in which the opponent will in all probability post his artillery.\r\n\r\nMachine gun fire may sometimes be employed to sweep defiladed spaces in\r\nfront of the defensive line.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the direction of the hostile attack is known, the occupation of the\r\nposition should not be longer deferred. It is always risky to occupy\r\nthe position in the face of hostile batteries, especially as the fire\r\nof the defender’s guns is masked by the skirmishers moving forward. If\r\nthe defender can manage to give the attacker the impression that the\r\nposition is still unoccupied, perhaps thereby inducing him to advance\r\nless cautiously, and then surprise him with fire, a depressing moral\r\neffect far exceeding the material success may be counted upon.[458]\r\nThe firing line should be made so strong that the fire fight will\r\nhave a chance of succeeding. A gradual launching of the troops should\r\nnot be decided upon, as the losses are comparatively insignificant in\r\ndefense, and as it is important to develop a heavy fire so as to make\r\nit difficult for the enemy to gain the fire superiority. The principles\r\ngoverning the moment for opening fire have already been discussed (pp.\r\n147 and 154 supra).\r\n\r\n    [458] Engagement at Modder River, on November 28th, 1899.\r\n  Engagement at Colenso, on December 15th, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe enemy must be prevented from gaining the superiority of fire.\r\nThis should be accomplished by concentrating the fire from a large\r\nnumber of rifles upon the parts of the enemy’s force in motion. The\r\ndefender should make the most of the advantage which his preparedness\r\ngives him. The attacker’s firing line with its supports forms the\r\ntarget. A departure from this rule is in order, in the case of a French\r\nassailant, as the latter places the bulk of his force in the reserves\r\nand not in the firing line. It will frequently be practicable for the\r\ndefender to discontinue his fire and to take cover when the assailant\r\nlies down and fires; but, while under cover, everything should be\r\nprepared for resuming the fire when the enemy rises to continue his\r\nadvance (p. 156 supra).\r\n\r\nIf it has been found impossible to prevent the enemy from reaching the\r\nextreme limit of short ranges, the commander must decide whether to\r\ncontinue the fight until a decision is reached, or whether to break off\r\nthe action.\r\n\r\nWhen the opponent has entered the zone of short ranges, it will be too\r\nlate for the defender to retire, unless the terrain in rear of the\r\nposition is especially favorable, or other troops can take a hand in\r\nthe fight to cover the withdrawal. The onrushing assailant is received\r\nwith accelerated fire; the defender fixes bayonets, determined to risk\r\na fight at close quarters. “The defender who does not fix bayonets is\r\nalready casting furtive glances towards the best line of retreat.”\r\n\r\nWhile repulsing an assault, it would be a good plan for the defender to\r\nstep upon the rear wall of the trench so that the latter would become\r\nan obstacle for the attacker. But this scheme can only be employed when\r\nthe troops are completely in hand.\r\n\r\nWhile the fire of the defender is increased to the utmost intensity by\r\nthe entrance into the fight of all the supports, the general reserve,\r\nwhich now takes a hand in the fight, seeks to bring about the decision\r\nby advancing to attack. On arriving close enough to assault, the attack\r\nreaches its most critical stage, and even a counter-attack made by a\r\ncomparatively small force may turn the scale in favor of the defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE COUNTER-ATTACK.[459]\r\n\r\n    [459] See F.C. V. H. _Zum Studium der Taktik_, p. 418 et seq.\r\n\r\nIn large engagements, the great power of resistance possessed by well\r\nposted bodies of troops will often determine the commander of the\r\nforce on the defensive to contain the enemy at one point with a strong\r\ndefensive position, while at the same time assuming the offensive at\r\nanother. (This was planned, but not carried out, at Dresden, in 1813,\r\nand at Troyes, early in February, 1814; carried out with success, in\r\nLee’s operations around Richmond, during the latter part of June,\r\n1862, and on the Lisaine in 1871; and miscarried on the Shaho, because\r\nKuropatkin made his decision dependent upon reports in regard to the\r\nposition of hostile reserves, which were non-existent in reality).\r\nWhether the offensive should be assumed while the enemy is still in the\r\nact of deploying,[460] or whether one must be satisfied with assuming\r\nthe offensive at the last moment, is best determined by the relative\r\nstrength of the opposing forces. When battle-fronts are short this may\r\nstill be advantageous, but when the lines are long, a counter-attack\r\ncan affect only a small part of the assailant’s line, while the major\r\nportion thereof successfully pushes the attack home. Then the position\r\nand the day will be lost anyway, in spite of a local success.\r\n\r\n    [460] Roszbach, 1758; Austerlitz. 1805 (_Schlachterfolg_, p. 28);\r\n  Salamanca, 1812.\r\n\r\nThe initial measures taken assure freedom of action to the defense,\r\nbut the commander must not await exhaustive messages. Prompt action\r\nis necessary, either for throwing back the advanced troops of the\r\nassailant, or for striking a blow at the hostile flank. In the latter\r\ncase, it is an advantage if only weak reserves are struck, but hostile\r\nforces making a turning movement may also be encountered, and the\r\ncommander will have to decide whether to deploy quickly and assail the\r\nenemy, or whether to take his chances in a rencontre.[461]\r\n\r\n    [461] The advance of Memerby’s Brigade during the battle of\r\n  Noisseville. KUNZ, _Noisseville_, p. 41.\r\n\r\nEven a success gained at a tactically unfavorable point will make\r\nitself felt, if it is won early enough and if the most is made of it.\r\nAs a rule, tactical considerations determine where the commander should\r\nlaunch his reserves for the counter-attack.\r\n\r\nThe counter-attack here meant is an act of the commander of the whole\r\nforce; in bodies of troops acting as part of a larger force and in\r\nnumerically inferior forces, the warding off of the flank attack\r\nremains almost always the only remedy.\r\n\r\n“The general reserve should be posted at the point from which it can\r\nbest move forward, counter to the probable direction of the hostile\r\nattack, while, at the same time, making the most of the features of\r\nthe ground. When only one flank is secure, the general reserve is, as\r\na rule, placed in echelon in rear of the unprotected wing. When both\r\nflanks are in the air, nothing remains but to place sufficient reserves\r\nin readiness in rear of one flank to ward off a hostile envelopment,\r\nwhile retaining as strong a force as possible in rear of the other\r\nfor the purpose of bringing about the decision. The echeloned general\r\nreserve must have room for development, whether this be for warding off\r\na hostile envelopment or for making a counter-attack.” (Par. 410 German\r\nI. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThe general reserve should be posted in rear of the center of the\r\nposition only when the front is short and the situation is not as yet\r\ncleared up. In this position it will frequently be exposed to the fire\r\ndirected against the first line, and its entry into action will usually\r\ninvolve a loss of time. When adequate information is available of the\r\nmeasures taken by the opponent, or the nature of the ground compels him\r\nto direct his decisive attack against a wing, this alone determines\r\nthe position of the general reserve.\r\n\r\nSince the counter-attack is to take the enemy by surprise, the position\r\nof the general reserve must be concealed, and precautions must be taken\r\nto keep hostile patrols in the dark, as long as possible, in regard to\r\nits actual location. The ground over which the general reserve is to\r\nadvance should be free from obstacles, so that the counter-attack can\r\nbe made rapidly and with uniformity.\r\n\r\nSince the assailant will almost invariably endeavor to direct his\r\nattack against a flank, the general reserve of the defender should\r\nbe posted at such a distance in rear of the threatened wing that the\r\ntroops composing it will be sheltered to some extent from hostile\r\nfire. In order that the fully deployed general reserve, when making\r\na counter-attack, may clear with its inner flank the outer flank of\r\nthe line holding the position, and not get into the latter’s zone\r\nof fire, a sufficient interval must be left between the two. This\r\ninterval should increase with the size of the reserve. As a rule, the\r\ncounter-attack should be launched so as to produce the decision when\r\nthe assailant has arrived within assaulting distance of the defender.\r\nThis requires that the general reserve and the line holding the\r\nposition be separated by an interval of at least 200 m. In addition,\r\nthe counter-attack must be so made that it will actually strike the\r\nassailant in flank; and this it cannot do unless the general reserve is\r\nposted sufficiently far to a flank. The center of the reserve should\r\nbe launched so as to strike not only the flank of the enemy’s firing\r\nline, but that of his supports as well. If the general reserve is\r\nposted too near the first line, there is danger of it being enveloped\r\ntogether with the first line, and committed to purely defensive action\r\n(refusing a flank). On the other hand, if it is posted too far to a\r\nflank, its timely entry into action is not absolutely assured; the\r\nassailant may turn against it, cut it off from the defensive position,\r\nand defeat it in detail. The farther the general reserve is off to a\r\nflank, the more effectively will it strike the enemy in flank, but it\r\nwill be correspondingly more difficult to conceal it. The necessity\r\nof pushing the general reserve far to a flank decreases, as the scope\r\nof the attacker’s envelopment of the defensive line increases. It may\r\nfrequently be to the defender’s advantage to induce the assailant\r\nto make a far-reaching envelopment, provided the line defending the\r\nposition is not placed in an unfavorable tactical situation by so\r\ndoing. Since the attacker will probably have detachments echeloned in\r\nrear of his flank, the troops entrusted with the counter-attack must\r\nsimilarly have an echelon in rear of their exposed flank in order to\r\nprotect themselves against a flank attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to lay down a fixed, normal strength for the reserve.\r\nThis depends upon the strength of the position, and the degree of\r\nresistance the intrenchments are capable of rendering; but, in any\r\ncase, the force intended for local defense should be strong enough\r\nto compel the enemy to deploy completely, and prevent his carrying\r\nthe defenses before the counter-attack is made. Large quantities of\r\nammunition and intrenchments capable of rendering effective resistance\r\nmust compensate for the shortage of men in warding off the enemy, in\r\norder that the general reserve may be made as strong as possible. The\r\nquestion, as to how thinly the position must be occupied, and how\r\nstrong the general reserve may be made, can only be answered in each\r\nparticular case. If the attack made by the general reserve is to\r\nproduce any effect, it must not be undertaken with too small a force,\r\nas it could then be checked by weak detachments.\r\n\r\nWhile the general reserve lies in waiting for the enemy, it may either--\r\n\r\n1. Remain in a preparatory position, in one or more groups, and deploy\r\nduring its forward movement; or\r\n\r\n2. Take up the attack formation from the start.\r\n\r\nThe first method has the advantage, when the space required is small,\r\nof permitting the general reserve to be concealed, and allows changes\r\nto be made in the direction of march and in the dispositions.\r\n\r\nThe second, although it enables the reserve to advance promptly to the\r\ncounter-attack, is rarely suitable, as the reserve in combat formation\r\nis not so easily concealed, as it is more difficult to make changes\r\nin the dispositions and the direction of march, and as this formation\r\nseems only practicable for making an advance in one direction--straight\r\nto the front.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance to know when the counter-attack should\r\nbe launched. In warding off the enemy by purely frontal action, no\r\nspecial disadvantages result from prematurely launching the general\r\nreserve; if it enters the action too late, it will still be able to\r\nthrow back the assailant who has penetrated into the position. With the\r\ncounter-attack it is different; it must take place when the opponent is\r\nunder the most effective fire at short range. If the counter-attack is\r\nmade prematurely, especially when the reserves and flank echelons of\r\nthe attacker have not as yet been used up, the latter, while, indeed,\r\nexposed to the most violent fire of the defender, will be able to\r\ntake counter-measures. In that case, two entirely independent actions\r\nmay result, and the counter-attack made by the general reserve may be\r\nchecked by the retained echelons of the attacker and repulsed by their\r\nfire. When launched prematurely, the counter-attack will not always\r\nrepulse the hostile attack; and when launched too late, it may perhaps\r\nstill bring about the decision, or avert a defeat, but it will never\r\nproduce decisive results.\r\n\r\nA counter-attack made after the attacker has penetrated into the\r\nposition, and while he is endeavoring to dislodge the garrisons of such\r\nsupporting points as still offer resistance, reckons with the fact\r\nthat the hitherto victorious assailant, exhausted and in confusion,\r\nwill not be a match for a well aimed blow delivered by a considerable\r\nnumber of troops. However, a defender will scarcely contemplate such\r\nan employment of his general reserve; for him the important thing\r\nis to repulse the attack in front of and not within the position.\r\nAlthough military history presents comparatively numerous instances of\r\nsuch _retours offensifs_, this may be explained by the fact that the\r\ncounter-attack was launched too late. The weakness of the assailant is\r\nbut momentary, and the most must be made of this by advancing against\r\nhim promptly by the shortest line. But if the assailant has had time to\r\nre-form and to bring up his batteries, it will usually be too late to\r\nmake a counter-attack.\r\n\r\n  Aymard’s Division (French), which had penetrated into =Servigny=\r\n  under cover of darkness, but had made no attempt to occupy the town\r\n  systematically or to re-form the disordered troops, was driven out\r\n  again by a counter-attack made by only eleven Prussian companies.[462]\r\n\r\n    [462] KUNZ, _Noisseville_, p. 52. _Das Wald- und Ortsgefecht_, p.\r\n  181.\r\n\r\n  The numerous counter-attacks made by the French during the battle\r\n  of =Wörth= (for example the counter-attack made by Maire’s Brigade)\r\n  pushed too far forward into the zone of the German artillery\r\n  fire, and did not have the expected success. The well-led French\r\n  counter-attack made by about 1200 men from the south edge of\r\n  the =Niederwald=, was discontinued at a timely moment.[463] The\r\n  well-directed counter-attack made by the 1st Turco Regiment at\r\n  =Wörth=, after the capture of =Elsaszhausen=, was successful and is\r\n  especially instructive.[464] The attack made by General de Sonis for\r\n  the purpose of retaking =Loigny= was undertaken too late and with\r\n  inadequate forces.[465] The same is true of the counter-attack made\r\n  by the 3rd Bavarian Division on =Zella= (4th July, 1866).\r\n\r\n    [463] KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, XIII, pp. 75 and 159.\r\n\r\n    [464] _Ibid._, XVI, p. 187, et seq.\r\n\r\n    [465] HÖNIG, _Volkskrieg_, IV, p. 124.\r\n\r\nThe French regulations recommend a unique procedure, which may be\r\nsuccessful when employed against an opponent not prepared to meet\r\nit. “Under certain circumstances, counter-attacks may be combined\r\nwith retreat maneuvers. The advanced troops should bring the enemy\r\nto a standstill with their fire and compel him to deploy. Then they\r\nshould break off the action without becoming involved in a fight at\r\nclose quarters. In this manner, the attacker is drawn onto terrain\r\nreconnoitered beforehand, where fresh troops, hidden up to the last\r\nmoment, attack him impetuously under favorable conditions at a time\r\nwhen he is tired and worn out by a long movement.”\r\n\r\nThe most difficult thing about a counter-attack is to seize the\r\nright moment for launching it. As it is impossible to foretell how\r\nlong it will take the enemy to arrive within assaulting distance,\r\nno rule can be laid down as to the proper moment for launching the\r\ncounter-attack. The best plan would be to screen the movements of the\r\nreserve, and, as the attacking troops approach, to bring it gradually\r\nup to the point from which it is to move forward. A commander requires\r\nwide practical experience and great force of character to judge the\r\nsituation calmly and dispassionately, while fully aware that launching\r\nthe counter-attack either too soon or too late may prejudice the\r\nresult. There is always danger that the suggestions which reach him\r\nfrom various quarters may cause him to take half-measures. The stronger\r\nthe general reserve and the weaker the force holding the defenses, the\r\nmore numerous and urgent will be the requests for support; and he will\r\nnot find it easy to resist the temptation to grant these requests and\r\naccordingly weaken the general reserve, which is intended for offensive\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the question as to whether the counter-attack\r\nshould rely on fire action alone, or should resort to the bayonet as\r\nwell. The unexpected advance of a large body of troops against a flank\r\nof the enemy will rarely fail to produce an effect. If the enemy does\r\nnot yield to fire, it is obvious that an assault will have to be made.\r\nA counter-attack made unexpectedly is, as a rule, successful at the\r\nstart; but, if its commander follows up this initial success when not\r\nsupported by strong reserves, a reverse may take place resulting in the\r\ndefeat of the defender’s entire force.\r\n\r\n  A counter-attack made by three companies (9th, 10th, and 11th) of the\r\n  3rd Bavarian Infantry Regiment brought relief to the two batteries\r\n  which had gone into action near =Goury= (battle of =Loigny=). The\r\n  Ist and IInd Battalions, 3rd Infantry, the Ist and IInd Battalions,\r\n  12th Infantry, and the 7th Jäger-Battalion joined in this attack, and\r\n  when the batteries finally followed, the force succeeded in throwing\r\n  back the French battalions immediately opposing it. The twenty-one\r\n  companies now made the mistake of attacking =Ecuillon=, which they\r\n  occupied. The attacking force had traversed about 2000 m., and as\r\n  there were no reserves and flank echelons, the Bavarians were obliged\r\n  to give way before an assault made by seven fresh battalions against\r\n  their unprotected left flank. The mistake of pushing forward too far,\r\n  and the lack of supports in rear of the exposed flank, was bound to\r\n  exact a penalty, as soon as the French were in a position to advance\r\n  on their own account.[466]\r\n\r\n    [466] HÖNIG, _Volkskrieg_, IV, p. 43.\r\n\r\n  A very instructive episode occurred on August 26th, 1904, near\r\n  =Tsinortun=. Toward noon the Japanese Guard and the 10th Division\r\n  advanced through fields of tall kaoliang for the purpose of\r\n  enveloping the right wing of the IIIrd Siberian Army Corps. The\r\n  commanding general, Lieutenant-General Iwanov, directed the reserve\r\n  (apparently parts of the 3rd East-Siberian Rifle Division) to make a\r\n  counter-attack against the left flank of the Japanese. The Russian\r\n  counter-attack was taken in flank by a brigade of the Guard, which\r\n  followed in rear of the Japanese attacking force, and had to retire.\r\n  The decision was then brought about by the counter-attack made by the\r\n  140th Infantry, which unexpectedly appeared on the left flank of the\r\n  Japanese. The engagement at Tsinortun is moreover of special interest\r\n  as regards the Japanese method of attack.[467]\r\n\r\n    [467] LÖFFLER, _Allgemeine Lage_, I, pp. 68 and 69. V. HOEN, _Der\r\n  russisch-japanische Krieg_, in _Organ des militär-wissenschaftlichen\r\n  Vereins_, p. 166. NIESSEL, _Enseignements tactiques_, p. 158.\r\n\r\nSo far we have only considered the counter-attack made against\r\nthe flank of an attacker, and against the front of an enemy who\r\nhas victoriously penetrated into a position. The success of a\r\ncounter-attack against the enemy’s flank depends primarily on moral\r\nfactors; besides, after protracted fighting, supports and reserves in\r\nrear of the flank are frequently lacking, so that the attacker cannot\r\nquickly form an adequate firing front towards a flank.[468]\r\n\r\n    [468] Examples of successful counter-attacks against an enemy’s\r\n  flank: Battle of Loigny, on December 2nd, 1870; the counter-attack\r\n  made by 21 companies of the 4th Brigade at Goury (HÖNIG,\r\n  _Volkskrieg_, IV, p. 55), and that made by the Ist Battalion,\r\n  10th Infantry, and the Ist and IIIrd Battalions, 13th Infantry,\r\n  at Goury (_ibid._, p. 41); the flank attack made by Kottwitz’\r\n  Brigade (_ibid._, p. 82, and p. 220 supra); the flank attack made\r\n  by the garrison of Fougeu on the attacking columns of General\r\n  Sonis: the brilliant flank attack made by the IIIrd Battalion, 90th\r\n  Infantry, during the battle of Orleans, on December 4th, 1870 (KUNZ,\r\n  _Orleans_, p. 148); and the counter-attack made by General Bataille\r\n  on the Stiring Wald during the battle of Spicheren. The last-named\r\n  counter-attack is a good model, both as regards conception and\r\n  execution. (_Wald- und Ortsgefecht_, pp. 93 and 96).\r\n\r\nTheoretically, a frontal counter-attack, _i.e._, one made straight\r\nto the front from a position, while the assailant is advancing to\r\nthe assault on a broad front, ought to offer the least chances of\r\nsuccess, but military history proves the contrary in those cases where\r\nthe defender awaited the proper moment. This moment arrives when the\r\ndefender clearly perceives that the enormous losses suffered by the\r\nattacker begin to impair the morale of his remaining men. This becomes\r\napparent through a slackening in the attack, through an uncertainty of\r\nmovement, and, finally, through hesitation, the latter being usually\r\npreceded by wavering.[469]\r\n\r\n    [469] “The defender will only be able to make a frontal\r\n  counter-attack from his position when he has repulsed the assault and\r\n  has made the most of fire action, or when it is important to drive\r\n  away the enemy who has been brought to a standstill in front of the\r\n  defender’s position. A premature counter-attack may lead to the loss\r\n  of the position.” (Par. 414 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of a determined counter-attack with cold steel during\r\nthe closing moments of an attack will undoubtedly be great. Meckel\r\nsays[470]: “Here likewise, it is of the greatest importance to bring\r\nup the supports promptly, so as to increase the volume of fire to the\r\nutmost and to produce that superiority which quite naturally resolves\r\nitself into an offensive movement. The defender who does not fix\r\nbayonets is already casting furtive glances towards the best line of\r\nretreat.”\r\n\r\n    [470] _Lehre von der Truppenführung_.\r\n\r\n  This “superiority” caused the French to advance from the wood of\r\n  =Elsaszhausen= against the skirmishers of the XIth Army Corps\r\n  appearing at the northern edge of the =Niederwald=. The success they\r\n  met with at the start induced the French to continue their advance,\r\n  and when a reverse occurred subsequently, the wood of Elsaszhausen\r\n  was taken by the Hessians without difficulty.[471]\r\n\r\n    [471] KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, XIII, p. 121, et seq.\r\n\r\nAlthough such counter-attacks, directed against the strong firing line\r\nof the attacker and unsupported by the defender’s fire, were frequently\r\nsuccessful in war, this was due to the moral effect produced on the\r\nattacker by the sudden and unexpected onset of a long line of infantry.\r\nTroops thus unexpectedly attacked, and, in addition, deprived of the\r\nsupport of their own artillery, almost invariably lost their heads.\r\nHowever, if the attacker is prepared for such an event, remains cool,\r\nmeets the counter-attack of the defender with a powerful fire at short\r\nranges, and brings up his supports, in order to follow up the effect of\r\nhis fire with an offensive movement, there can be no doubt as to the\r\nresult.[472]\r\n\r\n    [472] The battles of Soor and Kesselsdorf are interesting examples\r\n  of this. (_Kriege Friedrichs des Groszen_, II, pp. 75 and 234).\r\n  In both cases the defender’s frontal counter-attack forced the\r\n  assailant to face about; but at Soor a second line of infantry, and\r\n  at Kesselsdorf a charge made by the Bonin Dragoons finally turned the\r\n  scale in favor of the assailant.\r\n\r\nSuch a counter-attack, however, is only possible when the defender\r\nstill has strong, intact reserves at his disposal, which he has kept\r\nin readiness in the closest proximity to the firing line until the\r\ndecisive moment. An organization acting as part of a larger force,\r\nand whose flanks are secure, as a rule has no choice but to make a\r\nfrontal counter-attack, unless offensive action is to be dispensed with\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n  Short frontal counter-attacks from a position were made successfully\r\n  by the British in the battles at the opening of the 19th Century.\r\n  (In these counter-attacks, the British fired a volley and then\r\n  advanced to the assault). Such successful counter-attacks were made\r\n  during the battles of =Vimiero=, =Maida=, =Busaco=, and especially\r\n  =Waterloo=.[473]\r\n\r\n    [473] At Waterloo, the counter-attack made by Picton’s Division and\r\n  the British Guards repulsed the French attack. VON OLLECH, _Feldzug\r\n  von 1815_, pp. 230 and 247. See also note p. 151 supra.\r\n\r\n  At =Beaumont=, the 66th Infantry made a counter-attack when the\r\n  French had approached within 40 m. The 66th had already begun to\r\n  waver, here and there, when its energetic and unexpected advance\r\n  caused the French to retire.[474]\r\n\r\n    [474] HOPFFGARTEN-HEIDLER, _Beaumont_, p. 53.\r\n\r\n  In the battles of the =Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78=, frontal\r\n  counter-attacks were successfully made in several instances.\r\n\r\n  In the engagement at =Kazeljevo= (5th September, 1877), the frontal\r\n  counter-attack made by the Russians, who were numerically far\r\n  inferior, saved them from defeat, as all their lines of retreat were\r\n  obstructed by their trains, which had gone astray.[475]\r\n\r\n    [475] SPRINGER, _Der russisch-türkische Krieg_, III, p. 171.\r\n\r\n  The most instructive fight in this connection is the engagement of\r\n  =Gorni Bugarov= (1st January, 1878). General Weljaminov’s detachment,\r\n  which consisted of the Pensa and the Tambov Infantry Regiments,\r\n  occupied a flank position on the southern foothills of the Balkans,\r\n  on the road leading from =Orchanie= to =Sofia=. The Russians allowed\r\n  the Turks to approach to very short range before they opened fire,\r\n  which was immediately followed by a counter-attack all along the\r\n  line. This seems to have been the result of the initiative of the\r\n  several battalion commanders. The Turks (15 battalions) faced about\r\n  and retired on Sofia. The Russian infantry was led back to its first\r\n  position.[476]\r\n\r\n    [476] _Ibid._, VII, p. 134.\r\n\r\n  On the same day, the attack made by the Preobrajenski Regiment\r\n  of the Russian Guard at =Tashkessen= was repulsed by the frontal\r\n  counter-attack made by a weak force of Turkish infantry.[477]\r\n\r\n    [477] BAKER-PASHA, _War in Bulgaria_, II, p. 57.\r\n\r\nDuring the Russo-Japanese war such frontal counter-attacks were very\r\nfrequently made. When undertaken with inadequate numbers, they were\r\ninvariably repulsed by the fire of the Japanese, especially when the\r\nlatter found cover in previously constructed trenches.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisions of Various Regulations.\r\n\r\n  =Austria-Hungary.= If a counter-attack is contemplated, the commander\r\n  should resist every temptation to employ parts of the general reserve\r\n  for other purposes than for carrying out that attack. In this case,\r\n  the general reserve should be placed in readiness so that, while the\r\n  opponent advances within the decisive zone, it can quickly deploy\r\n  and carry out the counter-attack with determination by directing a\r\n  powerful fire against the flank of the enemy. Freedom of movement\r\n  on one flank is absolutely essential to the execution of the\r\n  counter-attack. Local frontal counter-attacks are to be avoided; the\r\n  enemy is to be annihilated by fire.\r\n\r\n  When it is not contemplated to make a counter-attack with the general\r\n  reserve, the latter is to be employed either for directly reinforcing\r\n  the troops in one of the sections, or for engaging the hostile troops\r\n  making an enveloping attack on the position.\r\n\r\n  =France.= The regulations make a distinction between counter-attack\r\n  (_contre attaque_) and offensive return (_retour offensif_). A\r\n  counter-attack is made by the reserve before the enemy penetrates\r\n  into the energetically defended supporting points. In contrast\r\n  herewith, every attempt to retake a captured position is called an\r\n  offensive return.\r\n\r\n  A counter-attack with troops of the second line is to be made as soon\r\n  as the assailant presses the fighting line too closely. A powerful\r\n  and suddenly executed counter-attack, supported by the fire of the\r\n  first line, will, at the very least, check the enemy until the\r\n  fighting line has had time to recover.\r\n\r\n  Occasionally, it may be advantageous not to await the crisis, but\r\n  to force the assailant to deploy by directing a heavy fire upon\r\n  him, then to break off the action, inducing the enemy to press\r\n  on, in order to draw him, by this means, onto previously selected\r\n  and reconnoitered terrain, where he is suddenly attacked in flank\r\n  by fresh troops. Military history shows that this very procedure\r\n  has frequently been successful. “If the attacker presses forward\r\n  too hastily and if he threatens to carry the defender’s position,\r\n  fresh troops, which have been assembled in a place sheltered from\r\n  view, attack him energetically, while the troops already engaged\r\n  increase the intensity of their fire. This powerful and energetic\r\n  counter-attack produces confusion in the enemy’s ranks and compels\r\n  him to retire, or at least to discontinue his forward movement until\r\n  he has had time to recover.”\r\n\r\n  “The same activity, the same determination to maneuver, must\r\n  prevail everywhere. Every mistake and every weakness of the enemy\r\n  must be quickly perceived and promptly utilized. The troops in the\r\n  counter-attack should move forward without hesitation and regardless\r\n  of the cost When such a forward movement has to be discontinued, the\r\n  commander must decide where it shall cease. The efforts of all should\r\n  be directed toward one object, that of tiring and demoralizing the\r\n  enemy by constant counter-attacks, until the moment arrives when the\r\n  commander must order the offensive to be assumed.”\r\n\r\n  =England.= The counter-attack may be made either by the garrison\r\n  of the firing trenches, as a frontal counter movement, or by the\r\n  general reserve, accompanied by artillery and cavalry, as a decisive\r\n  counter-attack. The moment when the attacker has used up his\r\n  reserves and is about to assault is generally considered as the most\r\n  propitious for making the counter-attack.\r\n\r\n  =Japan.= The Japanese entertain the same views as the Germans.\r\n  “The better the position, the location and construction of the\r\n  intrenchments, and the distribution of troops, the greater the\r\n  number of men that can be saved in garrisoning the position, and the\r\n  stronger the general reserve available for an offensive movement. By\r\n  this means the chances of victory are increased. * * * Frequently\r\n  there is danger that the defender will be committed to purely passive\r\n  defense, and that freedom of action will be lost. Therefore, when the\r\n  proper moment arrives, the decisive counter-attack should be made.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. THE RETREAT.\r\n\r\n(Par. 426 German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n\r\nA retreat under effective hostile fire means annihilation; only the\r\npresence of cover immediately in rear of the fighting line should\r\ninduce a commander to come to the weighty decision of reaching\r\nit by running. (Russia). On account of the great range of modern\r\nweapons, defeated troops, on open ground, cannot escape from fire\r\nby running.[478] No rules can be laid down in regulations as to the\r\nconduct of a retreat after a defeat. As a rule, further resistance is\r\nno longer possible; neither is it practicable to leave some troops\r\nin position to cover the retreat. The defeated force must retire in\r\na direction perpendicular to the front of the enemy,[479] and cannot\r\nre-form until the fire of the opponent ceases or at least abates. (Par.\r\n428 German I. D. R.). Artillery which is moved to the rear at a timely\r\nmoment, and all available cavalry should cover the retreat of the\r\ninfantry, so as to prevent the hostile cavalry from making the most of\r\nits opportunities for effective action.\r\n\r\n    [478] Furthermore, the danger of panic should not be\r\n  underestimated. See KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_, XIII, p.\r\n  49, and XVI. p. 243, in regard to the panic created in a skirmish\r\n  line near the Bruch Mühle west of Gunstett (Wörth). This skirmish\r\n  line was running to the rear toward a rallying position and the panic\r\n  was produced by the command “To the rear. Double Time! March! March!”\r\n  The panic was nipped in the bud by the energetic action of a mounted\r\n  field officer. Major v. Below.\r\n\r\n    [479] The 57th Infantry, whose right flank had been enveloped and\r\n  roughly handled by a counter-attack made by the French, retired to\r\n  its left rear through the fragments of the 16th Infantry. This caused\r\n  the two regiments to change places. (The attack made by the 38th\r\n  Brigade at Mars-la-Tour). _Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_, 25,\r\n  p. 35.\r\n\r\nTo order a retreat at the right moment requires military instinct;\r\nrules cannot be laid down in regard to it.\r\n\r\n“Troops which, while engaged with the enemy, are either withdrawn by\r\norder or defeated, can no longer choose their line of retreat. If the\r\nenemy pursues, they must retire perpendicularly to their former front,\r\nwithout changing formation, and need a force on which they can rally\r\nin order to prepare for renewed resistance. From this it follows that\r\na systematic retreat can only be carried out when the force still has\r\nsome distribution in depth. It would be wrong however, for a force\r\nintended for decisive action to retain a reserve for covering the\r\nretreat instead of employing it for the purpose of gaining the victory.”\r\n\r\nTo break off the action by systematically relieving the troops engaged\r\nwith the enemy,[480] is only possible if the force still has reserves\r\navailable, if cavalry and artillery are in a position to take a hand in\r\nthe fight, or if the troops that have been withdrawn are sheltered from\r\nthe enemy’s fire by features of the ground--all of which depends in\r\nmany cases on chance.\r\n\r\n    [480] _Taktik_, V, p. 344.\r\n\r\nIt is much more difficult to break off an action in defense than in\r\nattack, as in the former case, the assailant approaches closer with\r\nevery moment. This brings up the question, as to whether it would not\r\nbe better for the defender to hold out until darkness sets in than\r\nexpose his troops to the incalculable results of a retreat under fire.\r\nWhen the assailant has once entered the zone of short ranges, the\r\ndefender will no longer be able to effect a systematic retreat. If the\r\ndefender has used up all his reserves, the withdrawal should be begun\r\nat the point where the enemy is not pressing his attack, or where he\r\nhas been unable to gain a superiority of fire. When a withdrawal is\r\nmade, the whole local front should retire at once and simultaneously;\r\nit would be a mistake to reduce gradually the strength of the units\r\nengaged, for this would only give the enemy an opportunity to\r\nannihilate completely the remaining parts. If a company cannot maintain\r\nits position, a platoon certainly could not do so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the commander decides to break off the action, the reserve,\r\nif one is still available, should be sent to the rear to take up a\r\nrallying position, which should be so situated that it can make its\r\ninfluence felt as soon as the main position is evacuated. As every\r\ndefeated force, or one that is withdrawn by order, retires straight to\r\nthe rear, the rallying position, in order to allow the troops holding\r\nit to fire effectively, must be located as far as possible to a flank\r\nof the line of retreat. If the outer flank of the position can be\r\nadvanced, fire may be opened at an earlier moment, but this will only\r\nbe practicable in minor engagements. The distance of the rallying\r\nposition from the main defensive position should be such as to compel\r\nthe enemy to advance again under fire, and prevent his carrying both\r\nthe main defensive position and the rallying position at one rush. On\r\nthe other hand, the rallying position should not be so far to the rear\r\nthat the retreating troops may be annihilated before they enter its\r\neffective zone. However, as the troops in the rallying position are\r\nalso to effect a withdrawal, it is not a good plan for them to engage\r\nthe enemy from the start at too short a range. “It is most desirable\r\nwhen artillery and machine guns supported by cavalry suffice for this\r\npurpose, while the infantry uninterruptedly continues its retreat. The\r\nmounted arms follow later at an increased gait.” (Par. 429 German I. D.\r\nR.).\r\n\r\nThe rallying position should be occupied in time, so that all\r\ndispositions for holding it can be made calmly and without\r\nprecipitation. A powerful fire at mid and long ranges is requisite\r\nto prevent the enemy from reaching decisive ranges. The firing line\r\nshould, therefore, be strong and the supports weak. If a reserve\r\nis still available, it is at once sent back into a second rallying\r\nposition, to cover the withdrawal of the troops occupying the first\r\nrallying position. A free field of fire down to the shortest ranges is\r\nnot necessary. If the position is on elevated ground, the firing line\r\nshould be posted so far in rear of the crest that, while its fire can\r\nstill sweep the ground at mid ranges, and perhaps at the extreme limit\r\nof short ranges, the skirmishers, on retiring, will be sheltered as\r\nsoon as possible. Fire should be opened as soon as possible, in order\r\nto retard the enemy’s advance.\r\n\r\nThe troops holding a rallying position should delay the enemy’s advance\r\nlong enough to give the retiring force ample time and room to re-form,\r\nso that it can effect its retreat in good order. When this has been\r\naccomplished, the troops occupying the rallying position retire, unless\r\nthere is hope that fresh troops may bring about a change in the state\r\nof affairs. As a rule, a second rallying position will be necessary,\r\nbut it would be a mistake to halt in every seemingly favorable\r\nposition. When a retreat has once been decided upon, it is generally\r\nnecessary to get away from the enemy as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n“The commander must conduct the combat attending a retreat according to\r\na well-ordered plan. He must indicate where the rallying position is to\r\nbe, what troops are to occupy it, and assign march directions to the\r\ndifferent columns. Only after he has given these orders and has assured\r\nhimself that they will be executed, does he leave the battlefield, in\r\norder to meet his troops soon thereafter with new orders.[481] The\r\nrest is the business of subordinate leaders.” (Par. 432 German I. D.\r\nR.). The latter remain with their organizations for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining order and cohesion. (Par. 297 German I. D. R.). Adjutants\r\nand officers detailed to receive orders should be sent to the rear\r\nahead of the troops.[482]\r\n\r\n    [481] This sentence in our regulations, not to be found in those of\r\n  other armies, was necessary to absolve a superior commander from all\r\n  blame for leaving his troops and the battlefield. V. SCHLICHTING, I,\r\n  p. 115. See _Taktik_, V, p. 350.\r\n\r\n    [482] For the conduct of a retreat, see _Taktik_, V, p. 373, et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. CONTAINING ACTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DELAYING ACTION AND THE HOLDING ATTACK.\r\n\r\nSince the attacker will invariably seek to overpower the defender,\r\nand the latter will endeavor to prevent this by force of arms, it is\r\nobvious that an enemy can be “delayed” or “held” only when he permits\r\nthis to be done. It is difficult to conduct a delaying action or a\r\nholding attack, because our training, which is based on offensive\r\naction, causes subordinate leaders to follow up every little advantage.\r\nIn delaying actions, the defensive, and in holding attacks, the\r\noffensive intention predominates. The latter may consist of merely\r\nthreatening the enemy with an attack, or of seriously engaging him.\r\n(Par. 392 German I. D. R.). Both the delaying action and the holding\r\nattack aim at deceiving the enemy.[483] Accordingly, the characteristic\r\nfeatures of these combats are great frontage, large expenditure of\r\nammunition, and long range fire, but, at the same time, few rifles,\r\nin order to deceive the enemy as to the strength of our force. In\r\nboth combats, troops require considerable distribution in depth. The\r\nobject of a delaying action is to gain time until the troops in rear\r\ncan deploy, neighboring columns can come up, or a turning movement\r\ncan become effective. (Par. 417 German I. D. R.). Troops fighting a\r\ndelaying action require considerable distribution in depth so that\r\nthey can effect a withdrawal. Distribution in depth is still more\r\nnecessary in a holding attack,[484] in order that the troops may be\r\nable to repulse a counter-attack made by the enemy, or, by attacking\r\nhim energetically, prevent his withdrawing. A force fighting a delaying\r\naction should keep its supports far to the rear, while a force charged\r\nwith holding the enemy should keep them in close proximity. By properly\r\nemploying his artillery, the commander can best exercise an influence\r\non the course of the combat. (Par. 419 German I. D. R.). Since a\r\ndelaying action is to be fought at long ranges, a field of fire is\r\nonly required at those ranges; defiladed spaces in the foreground may\r\nfrequently be a positive advantage. The fire fight is kept up only so\r\nlong as it is necessary to keep the enemy at a distance. In a holding\r\nattack, it will not be proper to keep up a continuous fire; the violent\r\nfire breaking forth from time to time must teach the defender that a\r\nforce is lying in waiting opposite him, ready to rush forward at a\r\nmoment’s notice.\r\n\r\n    [483] This is still more pronounced In demonstrations. (_Taktik_,\r\n  V, p. 11). “Feints are to deceive the enemy as to our intentions,\r\n  but they may consist of offensive action. The regulations do not lay\r\n  down specific rules either for them or for other more rare methods\r\n  of combat; accordingly, their conduct will vary with the situation.”\r\n  (Par. 420, German I. D. R.).\r\n\r\n    [484] _Taktik_, V, p. 161.\r\n\r\nThe object of threatening with an attack may frequently be accomplished\r\nby engaging the enemy with several detachments which are separated\r\nby intervals. (Par. 288 German I. D. R.). The negative object of\r\npreventing the enemy from withdrawing may be accomplished with a\r\nweak force; the positive object of compelling the enemy to use up\r\nhis reserves in the early stages of the fight and at a less decisive\r\npoint, requires that lie be engaged with a stronger force. A determined\r\ncommander will not allow himself to be held by demonstrations. The\r\nmanner in which the Vth Army Corps forced the French to bring up their\r\nreserves into the first line at Wörth, is worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\nThe size of the group charged with holding the enemy depends upon the\r\nextent of front to be covered and the probable duration of the combat.\r\nThe conduct of such a force will vary considerably, depending upon the\r\ndistance to the point where the decisive action is to be fought. When\r\nthe holding force is close to this point, it should engage the enemy\r\nenergetically.\r\n\r\n  =England.= The holding attack is to deceive the enemy as to the\r\n  direction in which the main attack will be made, and, when the\r\n  crisis of the action approaches, prevent his withdrawing troops from\r\n  those parts of his front which are only threatened and opposing the\r\n  decisive attack with nearly his entire force. Accordingly, the troops\r\n  making the holding attack should act vigorously, as soon as the\r\n  attack develops, and be in readiness to transform their demonstration\r\n  instantly into a real attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. THE INFANTRY COMBAT ACCORDING TO VARIOUS DRILL REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUSTRIAN DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1903.[485]\r\n\r\n    [485] The various provisions of the German and Austrian Infantry\r\n  Drill Regulations are skillfully compared by Major-General\r\n  REGENSPURSKY V. REGENY, Austrian Army, in an article entitled _Die\r\n  taktischen Lehren des Exerzierreglements für die k. k. Fusztruppen\r\n  vom Jahre 1903. Ein Vergleich mit dem deutschen Reglement 1906_.\r\n  (_Militär-Wochenblatt_, 1906, Nos. 7 and 8).\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK.\r\n\r\n  Both the rencontre and the attack on a position prepared for defense\r\n  are considered. The regulations in regard to the rencontre have been\r\n  revised, so as to permit a commander to launch the battalions of his\r\n  main body directly from route column, or to concentrate his main body\r\n  farther to the rear, while his advance guard stands on the defensive.\r\n  The =attack on a position prepared for defense=, even after the\r\n  attacker’s artillery has succeeded in paving the way for its\r\n  infantry, consists of a laborious advance from one firing position\r\n  to another. The question as to whether an attack is feasible without\r\n  the support of artillery fire, is answered to the effect that it\r\n  will, as a rule, be a difficult undertaking, unless the artillery has\r\n  sufficiently silenced the batteries of the defender. The regulations\r\n  divide the attack into two clearly defined phases, viz., the advance\r\n  to the decisive firing position (the main firing position), and the\r\n  decisive action.\r\n\r\n  The provisions of the regulations coincide very nearly with the views\r\n  considered sound in Germany, and therefore an attempt will here\r\n  merely be made to point out several differences. The combat formation\r\n  necessary for the decisive stage of the action is taken up during\r\n  the preparatory stage, so that, when the forward movement commences,\r\n  the troops need only move straight to the front. (Par. 568). In a\r\n  division, by appropriately combining “tactical units”, echelons are\r\n  formed, whose strength depends upon the purpose of the combat, the\r\n  information of the enemy, and the relation of the division to other\r\n  bodies of troops. (Pars. 533, 540 and 541). Rules for the employment\r\n  of thin or dense firing lines are not given. “The attacker should\r\n  advance impetuously to the point where he can employ his rifles\r\n  effectively,” (Par. 582).\r\n\r\n  “In an attack, everything should be done to get within effective\r\n  range of the opponent before fire is opened by the whole line.” (Par.\r\n  323). When acting as part of a larger force, a platoon may open\r\n  fire independently, if it suddenly encounters the enemy or if it\r\n  finds a good opportunity for firing which the company commander has\r\n  overlooked. (Par. 338). Unless the battalion commander has reserved\r\n  to himself the right of designating the moment for opening fire, the\r\n  company commanders direct when fire shall be opened, and conduct the\r\n  fire fight at mid and short ranges. At long ranges, the battalion\r\n  commander designates the companies that are to fire.\r\n\r\n  =Kinds of fire.= Fire at will and volley fire are employed. As a\r\n  rule, volleys are only used when the troops are in close order, but\r\n  may also be used in skirmish line to test the range. According to\r\n  par. 331, the rate of fire may be accelerated, and in pars. 327 and\r\n  686, fire surprises are authorized.\r\n\r\n  When exposed to effective fire, the firing line is to =advance by\r\n  rushes=. These are to be made by alternate units moving forward,\r\n  supported by the fire of those remaining behind. Rushes are only in\r\n  exceptional cases to be made by units smaller than a platoon. “The\r\n  length of the rushes depends upon the character of the ground and\r\n  the tactical situation, as well as upon the physical condition of\r\n  the men. They serve as an expedient for reaching the next firing\r\n  position.” (Par. 313).\r\n\r\n  Movements under effective hostile fire may sometimes be made by\r\n  =crawling=. This is considered especially useful in rectifying\r\n  alignments. (Par. 196).\r\n\r\n  For =envelopment=, see p. 362 supra.\r\n\r\n  For the =use of the spade in attack=, see p. 393 supra.\r\n\r\n  =Assault.= “The close approach of a long firing line to an enemy who\r\n  occupies a good position, may well pass as a proof of the assailant’s\r\n  superiority. Nevertheless, this does not, under all circumstances,\r\n  furnish assurance that a forward movement for the purpose of\r\n  penetrating the hostile position will now succeed; a premature\r\n  assault may still result in disaster.\r\n\r\n  “As long as the conduct of the opponent does not show clear\r\n  indications that his fire power is crippled, nothing remains for\r\n  the attacker but to continue the fight for the superiority of\r\n  fire. In doing this, the commander should not hesitate to put in\r\n  his last man if necessary. The assault--in case the enemy still\r\n  offers resistance--should not be made until the attack has been\r\n  pushed sufficiently close to the enemy’s position, and the power of\r\n  resistance of the enemy is palpably broken.\r\n\r\n  “It is immaterial what formations are taken up for this closing act\r\n  of the combat, as it should be the natural culmination of a situation\r\n  strained to the utmost. The troops must understand that there is no\r\n  longer any chance to go back; that on the contrary, at this moment,\r\n  honor and salvation lie wholly in moving to the front.\r\n\r\n  “When the assault has once begun, the hostile position should be\r\n  carried in one rush. Any hesitation or halting, at this critical\r\n  stage of the action, may nullify the previous success, and must\r\n  therefore be quickly overcome by the reserves, if any are still\r\n  available, taking a hand in the fight.” (Pars. 590-592).\r\n\r\n  The decision to assault may emanate either from the firing line, from\r\n  the commander of the whole force, or from the commander of one of the\r\n  units. If the decision emanates from the firing line, all the troops\r\n  are to conform to the movement of that line. The following provision,\r\n  which applies even to a company acting alone, differs from the German\r\n  regulations, viz., “During the assault, a part of the assailant’s\r\n  force should, whenever practicable, continue its fire and direct it\r\n  upon any hostile reserves that may appear.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSE.\r\n\r\n  The regulations governing the =defense seeking a decision= differ\r\n  but little from the views entertained in Germany. The actual work\r\n  of preparing a position for defense is not to commence until the\r\n  direction in which the enemy is going to make his attack is known.\r\n  The assailant is to be prevented, as far as possible, from obtaining\r\n  information of the position and the measures taken for strengthening\r\n  it. This is to be accomplished by pushing small detachments to the\r\n  front to hamper the enemy’s advance.\r\n\r\n  In the past, =advanced positions= were decidedly opposed by the\r\n  Austrians, but at present their use is recommended in cases where\r\n  time is to be gained or the enemy is to be deceived, or where\r\n  fire from such positions would inflict considerable losses on the\r\n  enemy. However, the regulations seek to obviate the danger of the\r\n  principal fight taking place in the advanced position instead of in\r\n  the main position, by adding: “But such a measure should not cause\r\n  the commander to swerve from the firm determination to carry out his\r\n  original intention.”\r\n\r\n  The tremendously increased fire power of infantry is to make it\r\n  possible to hold the front with a comparatively weak force, while\r\n  the remaining troops are concentrated as a reserve with which the\r\n  actual decision is to be brought about. The commander should resist\r\n  every temptation to use the general reserve for other purposes than\r\n  for carrying out the =counter-attack=, which should be ordered when\r\n  the assailant is under the most effective fire of the position. The\r\n  general reserve should then be quickly deployed and should make its\r\n  attack with determination, by directing a violent fire against the\r\n  flank of the enemy. Local frontal counter-attacks are to be avoided.\r\n  The garrison is only charged with the task of annihilating the enemy\r\n  with its fire, which should be increased to the utmost intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1903 AND 1906.[486]\r\n\r\n    [486] Major-General MIKULICZ RADECKI, Austrian Army, _Das neue\r\n  Exerzierreglement der italienischen Infanterie_, Vienna, 1906. V.\r\n  GRÄVENITZ, _Die neueren taktischen Vorschriften für das italienische\r\n  Heer_, in _Vierteljahrsheft_, 1905, I, p. 90, et seq. _Der\r\n  Infanteriekampf in der oberitalienischen Tiefebene_, in _Streffleur_,\r\n  1907, October and November numbers (also obtainable in special\r\n  pamphlet form).\r\n\r\n    P. RATH, _Der Kampf in der italienischen Kultur_, in _Militärische\r\n  Welt_, 1907, January-February number.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK.\r\n\r\n  The peculiar character of the probable Italian theater of war in\r\n  Upper Italy, with its numerous forests of tall timber, and its many\r\n  defiles, causes special attention to be paid to the offensive.[487]\r\n  The regulations emphasize the necessity of the coöperation of\r\n  infantry and artillery.\r\n\r\n    [487] Unless otherwise ordered, the advance guard advances against\r\n  the hostile forces which it encounters in its march, whether its\r\n  action be to determine, as quickly as possible, the strength of the\r\n  opponent and to save its main body from an unnecessary delay, or\r\n  whether it be to deceive the opponent as to the location of its own\r\n  forces, or, in certain cases, to make the most of a surprise. (Par.\r\n  37).\r\n\r\n  Although the platoons intended for the firing line are brought up\r\n  in close order formation, the actual combat formation is not taken\r\n  up until the situation makes this necessary; but, in any case, the\r\n  leading element is to enter the zone of hostile fire in a deployed\r\n  formation. To neutralize the mixing of units as much as possible\r\n  as the action progresses, the firing line is formed into groups\r\n  separated by intervals of 4-5 paces, although this increases the\r\n  casualties. These intervals may be increased, when required, to 10\r\n  paces. (Intervals between skirmishers in the firing line are usually\r\n  at least 15 cm., otherwise 3 paces). The firing line is to advance\r\n  until increased casualties force it to open fire.\r\n\r\n  =Kinds of fire.= Only fire at will is employed. (This is also used\r\n  when the troops are in close order and formed in four ranks). The\r\n  battalion commander in the first line directs that fire be opened, as\r\n  soon as it is certain that a good effect can be produced. When two\r\n  targets appear, the fire is to be directed upon the one promising the\r\n  best results (_i.e._, not necessarily the one that is tactically most\r\n  important). “In order that the intensity of the fire may correspond\r\n  to the requirements of the tactical situation existing at the moment,\r\n  officers, by reason of their tactical training, should be able to\r\n  state approximately how many rounds are necessary to produce the\r\n  desired effect, the range, degree of visibility and character of the\r\n  target, the nature of the terrain and of their position, as well as\r\n  the physical condition and morale of their men being given. From\r\n  these estimates may be deduced how many rifles must be employed in\r\n  order to bring about a decisive result in the shortest possible time.”\r\n\r\n  The =advance by rushes= may be made either at a walk or at a run, but\r\n  the regulations do not prescribe in detail how it shall be conducted.\r\n  The following points are considered especially important: The time\r\n  for making a rush, its length, and whether it should be made by\r\n  a whole unit simultaneously or in echelon. All this depends upon\r\n  various circumstances, which the leader, alter due consideration\r\n  of the terrain and the hostile fire, as well as of the physical\r\n  condition and morale of his men, is to judge in each particular case.\r\n  In doing this, he is to bear in mind that the rush must be made as\r\n  unobserved by the enemy as possible, so that the latter cannot direct\r\n  his lire upon the advancing unit.\r\n\r\n  The rushes are to be made first by those parts of the firing line\r\n  which are favored by the terrain and which have gained a superiority\r\n  of fire over the hostile troops immediately opposed to them. Units\r\n  which could only advance by rushes at the cost of considerable and\r\n  useless losses, are to wait until the neighboring units have pushed\r\n  ahead, support these with their fire, and then advance in turn under\r\n  cover of the fire of the others.\r\n\r\n  As a general rule, so long as the hostile fire permits, rushes are\r\n  to be made by entire companies, or at least by whole platoons. The\r\n  length of the rushes and whether they are made at a walk or at a run,\r\n  depends upon the nature of the terrain. Upon completing a rush, fire\r\n  is to be opened at once.\r\n\r\n  When the intensity of the hostile fire increases, or after the\r\n  organizations have become mixed, rushes can no longer be made by\r\n  entire units but only by squads or like fractions. These leave the\r\n  firing line and endeavor to reach the next cover at a rapid run.\r\n  or, if cover be lacking, throw themselves down in order to open\r\n  fire again at the shorter range thus gained. As a rule, the leading\r\n  echelons open fire at once from their new positions, so as to\r\n  facilitate the advance of the others, unless special circumstances\r\n  make it advisable to delay the firing until all the other units have\r\n  reached a good position and are able to direct an effective fire upon\r\n  the enemy.\r\n\r\n  At short ranges, in covered terrain, or on ground swept by hostile\r\n  fire, the best way to avoid losses is to advance in small groups\r\n  consisting of several skirmishers. During each rush, the adjoining\r\n  flanks of neighboring units cease firing, so as not to injure the men\r\n  of the advancing unit. Platoon and company commanders hurry ahead,\r\n  while squad leaders see that all of the men move forward.\r\n\r\n  Standing crops frequently enable the echelons in rear to follow the\r\n  firing line in closer order, and may even permit supports, which are\r\n  to carry that line forward, to come up in that formation.\r\n\r\n  The =assault= is to be made either in close or extended order to the\r\n  tune of the Royal March and with loud cheers.\r\n\r\n  The regulations assume, however, that the superiority of fire, gained\r\n  by the mutual coöperation of infantry and artillery and by the\r\n  participation of the reserves, will induce the opponent to retreat.\r\n  When engaged with an obstinate opponent, who remains in his position,\r\n  only a part of the leading line is to be launched against certain\r\n  sections (_tratti_) of the defensive position, while other parts, by\r\n  means of rapid fire, prevent the enemy from supporting the threatened\r\n  sections. In conjunction with this frequently emphasized scheme of\r\n  penetrating several specially important sections of the hostile\r\n  position, the regulations express the view--by no means generally\r\n  considered sound-that the capture of several judiciously chosen\r\n  points will force the enemy to retreat.\r\n\r\n  The assault is, as a rule, to be made by order of the commander of\r\n  the whole force. The short burst of rapid fire preceding the assault\r\n  is suddenly terminated by the command “attention” (_attenti_), and\r\n  at the command “to the assault” (_per l’assalto_), the men throw\r\n  themselves with loud cheers, accompanied by the sounding of trumpets\r\n  and the beating of drums, upon the enemy. When a unit has already\r\n  gotten so close to the enemy that further waiting would be useless,\r\n  it advances to the assault, after getting permission therefor, or,\r\n  otherwise, on its own responsibility. All the rest of the troops are\r\n  to join in this movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSE.\r\n\r\n  So long as it is not definitely known in which direction the enemy\r\n  will approach, the position is to be occupied with as weak a force as\r\n  possible. The decision is to be brought about by a =counter-attack=.\r\n  Long range fire is only considered proper on broad stretches of open\r\n  terrain devoid of cover; and, in general, fire is not to be opened\r\n  until the enemy arrives at short ranges. As soon as fire is opened,\r\n  all the supports are to be in the firing line. A counter-attack is\r\n  undertaken by the first line only in exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK.\r\n\r\n  Both the French and the German regulations show a decided preference\r\n  for the offensive, and both have eliminated all rules which might\r\n  produce normal formations. There is an unmistakable inclination\r\n  towards shock tactics in the French regulations, although the term\r\n  “shock troops” has been replaced by “maneuvering troops”. “The\r\n  forward movement alone is decisive and irresistible.... The fire is\r\n  the element that executes”. The habit of looking upon the German army\r\n  as a probable opponent leads the French to provide for reconnaissance\r\n  with mixed detachments. The regulations do not touch upon the tactics\r\n  of the rencontre, and prescribe a more cautious conduct for the\r\n  advance guard than the German regulations.[488] The advance guard\r\n  is to occupy supporting points, under cover of which the main body\r\n  can deploy, and to complete the reconnaissance by its fight. The\r\n  necessity of infantry detachments completing the reconnaissance made\r\n  by the cavalry is particularly emphasized.\r\n\r\n    [488] See pars. 354, 356, 357 and 366 German I. D. R.\r\n\r\n  Another difference between the two regulations considered lies in the\r\n  manner of making use of the cover afforded by the ground. The danger\r\n  of going too far in this direction is guarded against in the German\r\n  regulations by assigning combat sections to the various units. The\r\n  French regulations prescribe a group formation of the several combat\r\n  elements, and a concentration at favorable points, while the plain\r\n  devoid of cover is left unoccupied. The center of gravity of a French\r\n  attack does not lie in the firing line--the fight for the superiority\r\n  of fire is not mentioned--but in maneuvering troops cautiously led\r\n  after the firing line. The defender is to be engaged all along the\r\n  line and, when the weak points of his position are recognized, the\r\n  commander-in-chief is to give the order for the assault.\r\n\r\n  This division of a force into a fire and a shock group causes the\r\n  French to prefer the echelon formation on general principles. A\r\n  brigade is formed as follows, for example: Two battalions of the 1st\r\n  regiment in the first line, which is followed at 400 m. by the third\r\n  battalion (_troupe d’entrainement_); the 2nd regiment follows at a\r\n  like distance as a reserve.\r\n\r\n  The regulations divide the attack into the artillery and the\r\n  infantry preparation (_préparation_), the decisive action (_l’action\r\n  décisive_), and the completion (_l’achèvement_).\r\n\r\n  =The artillery in the preparatory action.= The artillery is to\r\n  endeavor to silence the hostile artillery as quickly as possible,\r\n  without, however, expending more ammunition than is absolutely\r\n  necessary.... The commander is not to give the order for the attack\r\n  until the preparation is considered sufficient.\r\n\r\n  The troops are led forward over the terrain in a particularly careful\r\n  manner (see p. 208 supra), and are then concentrated in a sheltered\r\n  and protected place. Twelve mounted men (Reservists) are attached\r\n  to every infantry regiment for reconnaissance purposes. The manner\r\n  in which the French utilize the ground is typical. In this, widely\r\n  separated parts of the force may unexpectedly encounter a strong\r\n  hostile firing line, and may be defeated in detail.\r\n\r\n  The official regulations are supplemented by special regulations\r\n  issued in March 1907 for the army maneuvers by General Lacroix,\r\n  formerly commanding the VIIth Army Corps, and at present Vice\r\n  President of the Supreme War Council.\r\n\r\n  =Assembly.= The division is assembled in division square (_carré de\r\n  division_), in which the brigades are in line or in echelon, the\r\n  regiments in line of double columns or in line of company columns,\r\n  abreast or in echelon. If a frontal attack is to be made, in which\r\n  successive lines are pushed forward without any attempt to envelop\r\n  (in other words a pure frontal attack), the division is concentrated\r\n  with the brigades abreast, their regiments in echelon. If a flank\r\n  attack is to be made, in which the leading brigade must be protected\r\n  by an echelon and a reserve ready for any eventuality, the division\r\n  is concentrated with the brigades in echelon, their regiments\r\n  abreast. The artillery is posted in section column near a road in\r\n  rear of the _carré_. The pioneer company is divided into four parts,\r\n  corresponding to the four heads of columns of the assembled troops,\r\n  for the purpose of removing obstacles and cutting passages during the\r\n  forward movement. The cavalry is pushed forward and the assembled\r\n  force is protected in all directions by outposts of infantry and\r\n  cavalry.\r\n\r\n  =Preparations for the advance in mass formation.= During the\r\n  concentration, mounted officers reconnoiter the covering features of\r\n  the terrain which are to be utilized during the advance of the massed\r\n  division, and later these officers act as guides.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparatory attack formation.\r\n\r\n  =A. Pure frontal attack.= The leading regiment in each brigade is to\r\n  have two battalions in the firing line and supports, the third to\r\n  be echeloned in the rear of the outer flank. All of the battalions\r\n  are to be protected by infantry patrols and by a small detachment of\r\n  cavalry. The second regiment is to have one battalion echeloned in\r\n  rear of the inner flank of the leading regiment, and the divisional\r\n  cavalry is to be held in rear of the division, in readiness to\r\n  advance to the right or the left.\r\n\r\n  =B. Flank attack.= The two regiments of the leading brigade are to\r\n  furnish their own firing lines, supports, and reserves. The third\r\n  regiment is to be echeloned 500 m. in rear of the others, and the\r\n  fourth regiment is to form the general reserve. The cavalry is to\r\n  reconnoiter on the outer flank. In this case, as well as in a pure\r\n  frontal attack, the artillery is to take up a position from which it\r\n  can support the attack. Drummers, trumpeters, and bands, are to march\r\n  with the general reserve. The regulations state that it is absolutely\r\n  essential for infantry units to be sheltered from hostile observation\r\n  during their forward movement, and that they must remain under\r\n  control of their leaders up to the last moment. Troops are not to\r\n  deploy until they enter terrain swept by the enemy’s fire. (According\r\n  to the decision of umpires at peace maneuvers, this would be at 5000\r\n  m.). It should be borne in mind that deployed troops cannot move by a\r\n  flank, but only straight to the front.\r\n\r\n  The forward movement, in which the terrain will invariably cause\r\n  lateral displacements of troops, is made from cover to cover, when\r\n  necessary, from one supporting point to another. No hard and fast\r\n  rules or normal formations are prescribed for this advance.\r\n\r\n  The advance is to be made as long as possible without firing a shot.\r\n  When this is no longer practicable, recourse is to be had to fire, as\r\n  the only means of making a further advance possible.\r\n\r\n  =Kinds of fire.= Fire at will (_feu à volonté_), principally used at\r\n  short ranges, for the purpose of retarding the enemy’s advance; fire\r\n  with counted cartridges (_feu à cartouches comptées_), the number\r\n  being given (this is the fire usually employed); magazine fire (_feu\r\n  à répétition_); and the fire of specially designated marksmen. Volley\r\n  fire has been again prescribed. “Bursts of fire” (_rafales_) are\r\n  typical of French fire tactics. (See p. 164 supra).\r\n\r\n  After fire has been opened, the advance is to be made by rushes, but\r\n  the regulations do not prescribe how these shall be made.\r\n\r\n  The regulations contain a very realistic description of the infantry\r\n  combat with its fluctuations, isolated attacks, and reverses. They\r\n  emphasize that all must be animated by a desire to carry forward, by\r\n  means of reinforcements, any troops that may have been checked. At\r\n  the point where an advance is absolutely impossible, as many hostile\r\n  troops as possible are to be held fast by an energetic fire fight,\r\n  while the troops in the decisive attack engage the enemy and advance\r\n  impetuously.\r\n\r\n  A series of attacks is to be made from the various covering features\r\n  all along the line. These, made with the impetuosity inculcated\r\n  by the regulations, are very apt to fail prematurely. This is\r\n  particularly likely to happen because some of the troops will fall\r\n  behind, while others are able to push ahead more rapidly. These\r\n  attacks are to destroy the power of resistance of the enemy and to\r\n  exhaust him physically. The leading units are to cover with their\r\n  fire the advance of those who are less favored by the terrain.[489]\r\n  During peace maneuvers, the fight now comes to a standstill at a\r\n  range of 600 to 800 m.\r\n\r\n    [489] According to DENCAUSSE, in _Journal des Sciences Militaires_,\r\n  1906, and November-December number 1907, the infantry should endeavor\r\n  to approach within 700-800 m. of the enemy’s position without firing\r\n  a shot.\r\n\r\n  The supports (_renforts_) follow in a similar manner, ready to move\r\n  up into the firing line at the first signal to that effect, or\r\n  independently in case the situation requires it. Their entry into\r\n  action is in a general way determined by the commander of the whole\r\n  force. They are to augment the fire power of the firing line or\r\n  to carry it forward. The efforts of all are to be directed toward\r\n  constantly keeping up the advance.\r\n\r\n  At some points, the troops, when reinforced by their supports,\r\n  will be able to attack some of the enemy’s supporting points,\r\n  and to effect a lodgment on the ground captured. At other points\r\n  the attacking group will be too weak to push the attack home. In\r\n  such a case, the troops are to effect a lodgment on the terrain\r\n  (_s’accrochent sur le sol_) in rear of the nearest cover, as close\r\n  as possible to the enemy’s position, and are to maintain themselves\r\n  there until artillery or neighboring troops can support them. The\r\n  fire of these troops is to give the enemy the impression that an\r\n  attack is to be made here also. “No matter how successful these\r\n  usually protracted fights may be. troops must be launched in a\r\n  decisive attack at some points. The infantry should endeavor to\r\n  compensate for its numerical inferiority by skillfully utilizing the\r\n  ground and intrenchments, by great activity, and, above all else, by\r\n  invincible pertinacity. The supporting point will thus become the\r\n  center of the fight of a separate combat group.”\r\n\r\n  The commander should endeavor to maintain cohesion, and to equalize\r\n  fluctuations in the combat by controlling the activity of the\r\n  artillery and by putting in fresh troops. During this group combat,\r\n  the commander must decide where the retained troops should be\r\n  launched for the assault. The selection of a point of attack is\r\n  essentially the personal task of the commander and is an index of\r\n  character and of eye for the value of ground, neither of which can be\r\n  regulated by fixed rules. The regulations do not believe that close\r\n  order formations can be dispensed with in launching the assaulting\r\n  troops. Troops in close order, utilizing the ground to the best\r\n  advantage, so as to suffer but slight losses from hostile fire, are\r\n  to be brought up to the fighting line in a flexible echelon formation\r\n  in order to give to that line, as _troupes d’assaut_, the impetus for\r\n  the assault.\r\n\r\n  According to Thomas de Colligny,[490] formerly general staff officer\r\n  of the 9th Infantry Division, a battalion designated to make an\r\n  assault should form in four lines, each consisting of one company;\r\n  the distance between lines being 150 m., and the front covered\r\n  likewise 150 m. Each of the three leading lines should be formed\r\n  in line of platoons in columns of route at deploying intervals\r\n  sufficient to allow single rank line to be formed, and the fourth\r\n  line in a similar formation with 10-pace intervals between platoons.\r\n  When one of the lines is checked, the next succeeding one is to carry\r\n  it forward. If the French believe such close order formations to be\r\n  indispensable, they will be compelled to make a more extensive use of\r\n  cover.\r\n\r\n    [490] _Conseils à mon bataillon_, p. 107.\r\n\r\n  Colonel Dencausse is the exponent of a suggestion made by General\r\n  Bonnal. The latter forms a division for attack as follows: One\r\n  regiment, on a front of 600 m., as the advanced line (_avant ligne_),\r\n  in rear of that, the assaulting troops (_troupes d’assaut_). First\r\n  line: one regiment, its twelve company columns abreast; second line:\r\n  one regiment, its three battalions in double column at extended\r\n  intervals, 300 m. in rear of the first line; third line: the fourth\r\n  regiment, its battalions in route column abreast of each other, 300\r\n  m. in rear of the second line. While, during our peace maneuvers, we\r\n  continue to fire on the enemy’s firing line in the expectation that\r\n  his supports and reserve will in the end enter our zone of fire, it\r\n  might be advisable, when confronted by a French opponent, to direct\r\n  our fire on his reserves as soon as these become visible.\r\n\r\n  =Envelopment.= This is occasionally mentioned in the regulations\r\n  (for example in pars. 290, 301 and 302). However, the Field Service\r\n  Regulations, in discussing the attack, whose phases may vary in\r\n  length depending upon the intentions of the commander, state that the\r\n  attacker “may assail a wing or a flank of the enemy with superior\r\n  forces for the purpose of annihilating him.”\r\n\r\n  For the =use of the spade in attack=, see p. 392 supra.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSE.\r\n\r\n  The French defense is characterized by group fortifications, advanced\r\n  positions, and advanced posts[491] (intended to prevent hostile\r\n  reconnaissance), and numerous counter-attacks.\r\n\r\n    [491] These frequently consist of detachments of all arms\r\n  (_détachements de couverture ou de contact_). General BONNAL.\r\n  (_Deutsche Revue_, December number, 1907) says: “The French\r\n  regulation--in contrast to the German--provide in defense for\r\n  detachments of all arms, which are pushed forward for the purpose\r\n  of compelling the enemy to show his dispositions, and to draw him\r\n  on in a direction favorable for the defender. Both systems have\r\n  their advantages and disadvantages, and we, for our part, are of the\r\n  opinion that in sending out advanced detachments one must exercise\r\n  great care in order that these may not be defeated in detail, for\r\n  this is invariably detrimental to the whole force.”\r\n\r\n  For defense, a force is divided into the firing line with its\r\n  supports, and the maneuvering troops (general reserve) intended\r\n  for offensive action. In addition to calling attention to the\r\n  necessity of overwhelming with fire the hostile troops advancing over\r\n  open ground, the regulations recommend that the fire be withheld\r\n  occasionally and that the enemy be allowed to run into the greatly\r\n  accelerated fire which is unexpectedly directed upon him. The fire is\r\n  to be discontinued as soon as the enemy takes to cover, and is to be\r\n  increased to the utmost intensity when he moves in dense formation\r\n  over open ground. The supports are to be used to augment the fire\r\n  power of the firing line.\r\n\r\n  =Counter-attack.= General Lacroix states: “The frontal attack is\r\n  met by the offensive return (_retour offensif_), the flank attack\r\n  by the counter-attack. In order to prepare for this, the commander\r\n  should ride ahead to examine the ground, and to consider what\r\n  counter-measures he should take. The artillery can render the most\r\n  effective assistance by registering its fire upon the points at which\r\n  the enemy will probably advance, and by preventing him from leaving\r\n  his position. If the attack is successful, the local reserve advances\r\n  beyond the firing line, which has entered the hostile position, and\r\n  fires upon the retreating enemy. The general reserve now becomes the\r\n  local reserve, and the former firing line re-forms and becomes the\r\n  general reserve.”\r\n\r\n  The regulations make a distinction between counter-attack\r\n  (_contre attaque_) and offensive return (_retour offensif_). A\r\n  =counter-attack= is made by the reserve before the enemy penetrates\r\n  into the energetically defended supporting points. In contrast\r\n  herewith, every attempt to retake a captured position is called an\r\n  =offensive return=. (For details see p. 439 supra).\r\n\r\n  Occasionally, it may be advantageous not to await the crisis, but\r\n  to force the assailant to deploy by directing a heavy fire upon\r\n  him. then to break off the action, inducing the enemy to press on,\r\n  in order to draw him, by this means, onto previously selected and\r\n  reconnoitered terrain, where he is suddenly attacked in flank by\r\n  fresh troops. Military history shows that this very procedure has\r\n  frequently been successful.\r\n\r\n  “The same activity, the same determination to maneuver, must\r\n  prevail everywhere. Every mistake and every weakness of the enemy\r\n  must be quickly perceived and promptly utilized. The troops in the\r\n  counter-attack should move forward without hesitation and regardless\r\n  of the cost. When such a forward movement has to be discontinued, the\r\n  commander must decide where it shall cease. The efforts of all should\r\n  be directed toward one object, that of tiring and demoralizing the\r\n  enemy by constant counter-attacks, until the moment arrives when the\r\n  commander must order the offensive to be assumed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1905.[492]\r\n\r\n    [492] _Infantry Training._ _Combined\r\n  Training_.--_Vierteljahrshefte_, 1906, III, _The Development of the\r\n  Tactical Views in the British Army after the Boer War_.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK.\r\n\r\n  The regulations do not mention the rencontre. A normal offensive\r\n  battle consists of “an advance from point to point. Every lodgment\r\n  made in a new firing position weakens the enemy’s strength in his\r\n  main position, and paves the way for a further advance; every advance\r\n  must be thoroughly prepared and systematically carried out.”\r\n\r\n  In the following, the attack made by a brigade of four battalions\r\n  is used as a basis. While the commander reconnoiters under the\r\n  protection of his advance guard, the troops are concentrated in a\r\n  “preparatory formation”, the battalions in one or more lines of\r\n  “quarter columns” (column of companies). As soon as the commander\r\n  has decided which flank of the enemy he will envelop, against which\r\n  portion of the enemy’s line he will launch his decisive attack,\r\n  he assembles his subordinate commanders to receive the orders.\r\n  According to the regulations, it will rarely be possible to issue\r\n  orders while the troops are still in march. The orders are, as a\r\n  general rule, to be given in writing, and are to be supplemented\r\n  by verbal instructions, in which the commander calls attention\r\n  to the peculiarities of the terrain, especially where a hostile\r\n  counter-attack is possible. In exceptional cases, the brigade\r\n  commander designates the position to be taken up by the machine\r\n  guns, and gives directions to them in regard to supporting the\r\n  advance by long range fire. A base battalion is to be designated.\r\n  When the enemy’s position is visible, a point of attack is assigned\r\n  to every unit. When this is not practicable, the base battalion is\r\n  led forward by officers familiar with the ground, or it is given\r\n  a compass direction. Every leader is to provide independently for\r\n  reconnaissance and for communication by signal flags and also by\r\n  telephone; a mounted signal corps man accompanies the brigade\r\n  commander.\r\n\r\n  Every unit is formed in three lines for attack.\r\n\r\n  The =first line=, consisting of scouts and skirmishers with supports,\r\n  is made as weak as possible; without supports rarely more than\r\n  one-fourth of the whole force.\r\n\r\n  The =second line=, the reserves of the firing line, is under the\r\n  orders of the appropriate battalion commanders, and is to reinforce\r\n  the firing line, protect the Hanks, and deliver long range fire. The\r\n  second line is to fill up the firing line to the maximum density,\r\n  _i.e._, to one man per yard of front (0.9 m.).\r\n\r\n  The =third line=, the general reserve, is to assure the success of\r\n  the attack. It is to be made as strong as possible, seldom less than\r\n  one-fourth of the whole force.[493] “The general reserve is directly\r\n  under the orders of the commander of the whole force. It enables\r\n  him to meet the varying contingencies of an engagement or to ward\r\n  off counter-attacks. If the attack succeeds, the general reserve\r\n  pushes forward rapidly to take up the pursuit; if the attack fails,\r\n  it serves as a rallying force, but before the commander decides\r\n  to leave behind even a part of it, he should consider whether, by\r\n  launching all the troops at his disposal, he could break down the\r\n  resistance of the defender. The commander can only exercise an\r\n  influence on the course of the action by means of a reserve. If he\r\n  keeps in his own hands a strong reserve, he will have it in his power\r\n  to take advantage of any mistake the enemy may commit, to restore\r\n  the battle should the leading troops meet with a serious check, to\r\n  meet a counter-attack in force, or, in case of need, to provide the\r\n  additional strength required to drive the attack home.”\r\n\r\n    [493] According to the old regulations, a part of the general\r\n  reserve had to remain in rear in rallying positions. (See p. 397\r\n  supra).\r\n\r\n  In contrast with these provisions, we find, strangely enough, under\r\n  the heading “Brigade”, the hint that, when advancing to the assault,\r\n  it is advisable to keep back a portion of the reserve in a rallying\r\n  position. Even a battalion commander is invariably to retain at least\r\n  half a company at his disposal. The British were not without reason\r\n  censured because their flank attacks were ineffective in South Africa\r\n  on account of the lack of energy of the frontal groups, and their\r\n  new regulations accordingly contain detailed rules for the conduct\r\n  of the “holding attack”. The troops holding the enemy in front are\r\n  to threaten him for the time being. This is to be accomplished by\r\n  wide extension, and by deceiving the enemy by occasional bursts of\r\n  lire (_rafales_), by employing machine guns, by retaining supports\r\n  far in rear, and by retraining, for the time being, from advancing to\r\n  decisive ranges. But the troops are to be ready to join in the main\r\n  attack when the latter advances. The regulations state that, in order\r\n  to deceive the enemy effectually, adequate forces will have to be\r\n  launched and that the commander will have to act vigorously. (See p.\r\n  447 supra).\r\n\r\n  Fixed rules for the front to be covered by a unit in action are no\r\n  longer given. A unit fighting alone may cover considerably more\r\n  front than when acting as part of a larger force. In a decisive\r\n  attack, a battalion in the first line may put 125 rifles on every 100\r\n  yards (90 m.) of front; these are distributed between firing line,\r\n  supports, and battalion reserve; the latter may consist of one or\r\n  more companies. Entire companies are only deployed in exceptional\r\n  cases, for example on open ground, where it is difficult to bring\r\n  up the supports. The size of the reserve depends upon the losses to\r\n  be anticipated in the firing line; when these will be small, in all\r\n  probability, the reserve may be made as strong as the firing line\r\n  plus supports. In attack, a battalion may accordingly deploy on a\r\n  front not exceeding 800 yards (formerly 540 m. was prescribed). A\r\n  brigade of four battalions may deploy on a front of 1400-2100 m.,\r\n  depending upon the number of battalions engaged.\r\n\r\n  When the force arrives within 4 or 5 km. of the enemy, the battalions\r\n  are formed in two lines of companies. Each company in the first\r\n  line is preceded by a platoon in close order, and this is in turn\r\n  protected by scouts. As soon as these scouts can advance no farther,\r\n  they lie down and await the arrival of the fighting line. The latter\r\n  advances under cover of the supporting fire of infantry, machine\r\n  guns, and artillery. Fire of position is considered necessary. Fire\r\n  at will is from now on used. This is to vary in intensity according\r\n  to the character of the target, and the range. It is to increase to\r\n  special violence when the attacking infantry advances over level\r\n  ground or encounters obstacles. The fire is to be discontinued when\r\n  the advancing skirmishers reach cover. The firing line is to advance\r\n  as close to the enemy as it can without suffering excessive losses.\r\n  Fire is to be opened when the hostile fire makes this necessary, but\r\n  small losses are to be borne.\r\n\r\n  After the fire fight is once begun, it is to be conducted with\r\n  more rifles than the enemy has in action. “Battles are only won by\r\n  controlled fire directed upon targets at decisive ranges” (according\r\n  to the regulations, at ranges under 540 m.). Within the zone of\r\n  effective fire, all the troops are to deploy. In consequence of\r\n  this, skirmishers, who endeavor to work forward independently, are\r\n  scattered all over the terrain over which the attack is being made.\r\n  At the initial deployment, the interval between skirmishers is to\r\n  be about 5-15 paces; at short ranges, at points where the decision\r\n  is sought, there is to be at least one rifle for every two or three\r\n  yards of front (1.80-2.70 m. = 2¹⁄₂-3¹⁄₂ paces). Another paragraph\r\n  of the regulations prescribes that the maximum density is to be one\r\n  rifle per yard of front. The British views, when compared to those\r\n  entertained by them immediately after the South African war, have\r\n  undergone a noticeable change, especially as regards the frontage of\r\n  a firing line; dense firing lines, possessing strong fire power, are\r\n  at present deemed essential to a decisive fight, while the fire of\r\n  widely extended lines is considered ineffective. The intervals may\r\n  vary considerably, but the regulations state that it should be borne\r\n  in mind that the difficulties of conducting a fight are increased and\r\n  the fire power reduced when too great a front is covered; moreover,\r\n  that in covered terrain, and when counter-attacks may be anticipated,\r\n  an overextension is actually dangerous. Because of the necessity of\r\n  moving in thin skirmish lines, it is considered essential that the\r\n  men be trained to act independently, to continue the fight even in a\r\n  difficult situation, and to do everything in their power to carry\r\n  out the original intentions of the commander.\r\n\r\n  =Rushes= over open ground are not to exceed 80-100 yards (72-92\r\n  m.) in length; as a rule they are to be shorter. According to an\r\n  example given in the Firing Regulations, rushes are to be 25 yards\r\n  (22 m.) long, at ranges from 650-500 yards (580-450 m.). A rush is\r\n  to be continued while the enemy’s surprise lasts and he finds no\r\n  opportunity to deliver aimed fire. In covered terrain, the rushes are\r\n  to be made from one covering feature to another.\r\n\r\n  “On open ground and within effective range, long lines of\r\n  skirmishers, rising simultaneously, will suffer heavy losses even\r\n  when making short rushes; the sudden movement of smaller units may\r\n  take the enemy unawares, so that for a time at least well aimed fire\r\n  is avoided. The rush is continued only while the surprise of the\r\n  enemy lasts. The shorter the range, the smaller the advancing unit\r\n  will have to be, and the shorter the length of the rushes.”\r\n\r\n  The dispositions for a rush are to be made as unostentatiously as\r\n  possible. The rearward detachments, which follow by rushes, are to\r\n  advance, if possible, beyond the group already firing. When squads\r\n  are unable to advance by rushes, the men may crawl forward singly.\r\n\r\n  The regulations state that, when in close order, units of the\r\n  strength of company columns (80-100 men, 4 platoons, in column of\r\n  platoons at full distances), having a front of 10-12 files, suffer\r\n  comparatively small losses when exposed to long range fire (1800-1200\r\n  m.). The troops are to deploy before reaching effective ranges\r\n  (1200-600 m.), as they will otherwise suffer serious losses. At\r\n  decisive ranges the firing line is to be filled up to its maximum\r\n  density.\r\n\r\n  The whole force, a small part excepted, is to be launched in the\r\n  =assault=; a sudden and unexpected advance of the assaulting troops\r\n  is considered particularly important. The order for the assault is\r\n  to be given by the commander of the whole force, but the manner of\r\n  conducting it is left to company commanders.\r\n\r\n  When the attack would be too costly by day, however, the troops are\r\n  to intrench, wait until it is dark, and then advance to assaulting\r\n  distance, where they again intrench (machine guns, and even single\r\n  field guns are to be taken along). The assault is to be made, after a\r\n  brief but violent fire fight, at the first streak of dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSE.\r\n\r\n  In defense, a force is divided into the fighting line with supports,\r\n  and the reserve. The latter furnishes the outposts and the garrisons\r\n  for the advanced positions (so-called temporary positions). The\r\n  object of =advanced positions= is to mislead, deceive, and check\r\n  the enemy. They are to be evacuated before the troops in them\r\n  become seriously engaged. It is not considered necessary for the\r\n  =main position= to consist of a continuous line of trenches; every\r\n  platoon and even every squad may have its own trench. The principal\r\n  requirements are good field of fire and mutual support by oblique or\r\n  enfilade fire.\r\n\r\n  The strength of the garrison is to be governed by the size of the\r\n  field of fire and the character of the works. The regulations state\r\n  that, under favorable conditions, a few men can defend a broad\r\n  front, but that, when the attack is favored by the terrain, a strong\r\n  garrison is required. Firing trenches, unless they are to serve as\r\n  dummy intrenchments, are not to be constructed so as to stand out\r\n  against the horizon. The importance of masking firing trenches, and\r\n  of constructing overhead cover is emphasized; special cover trenches\r\n  for the supports may be constructed in rear of the crest.\r\n\r\n  Against skirmishers, fire is to be opened at 1000 m., but it is also\r\n  considered desirable to withhold the fire until they get within short\r\n  range. It is believed that this will be attended by success when the\r\n  assailant is ignorant of the position of the defender or makes his\r\n  attack with poorly disciplined troops. Continuous long range firing\r\n  tires the eye and the hand. The decision is to be brought about by a\r\n  =counter-attack= made by the general reserve. Local counter-attacks\r\n  by section reserves are also recommended. The tendency of the\r\n  British to make the section reserves very strong has been frequently\r\n  observed. The final stage of the combat consists, as in Wellington’s\r\n  day, of a counter-attack all along the line. As soon as the opponent\r\n  has arrived within assaulting distance, the troops holding the\r\n  position are to fix bayonets and, after delivering magazine fire, are\r\n  to make a short frontal counter-attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JAPANESE DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK.\r\n\r\n  The Japanese views coincide almost exactly with the German, but take\r\n  their peculiar theater of war into consideration.\r\n\r\n  =Kinds of fire.= Fire at will, volley fire, and rapid fire are used.\r\n\r\n  =Rushes= are not to exceed 100 m. in length, as a rule, but the\r\n  regulations admonish leaders to “guard against the mistake of making\r\n  rushes that are too short. When rushes are shorter than 30-40 m.,\r\n  their value will be insignificant, as a rule.” Leaders are likewise\r\n  to avoid sending forward units smaller than a platoon, in order that\r\n  the advance may not be too much retarded and the difficulties of\r\n  leading increased.\r\n\r\n  The regulations particularly emphasize that it will rarely be\r\n  possible “to shoot an enemy out of his position”, and that, on this\r\n  account, the decision will, as a rule, be brought about by the\r\n  assault with cold steel. They further state that, when the enemy can\r\n  be kept down by artillery fire, the advance of the infantry will\r\n  be easy; that, as it is difficult to obtain a timely effect from\r\n  artillery fire directed upon an enemy who takes advantage of cover or\r\n  who occupies a fortified position, the infantry cannot wait for the\r\n  successful termination of the artillery combat, but, on the contrary,\r\n  should advance while that combat is in progress, for only by so doing\r\n  can it count upon the effective coöperation of its artillery. But,\r\n  nevertheless, infantry is to make the attack independently, even if\r\n  it has to dispense entirely with the coöperation of the artillery.\r\n\r\n  The regulations consider the rencontre and the attack on a position\r\n  prepared for defense.\r\n\r\n  =Rencontre.= The regulations prescribe that in a rencontre the\r\n  advance guard should make a vigorous but, at the same time,\r\n  deliberate attack; that the commander should promptly decide what\r\n  to do, even if the situation is not entirely clear; and that, when\r\n  practicable, the main body should be launched as an entity. A fight\r\n  against a superior enemy is only to be avoided, for the time being,\r\n  in case the latter has gained a start in deployment.\r\n\r\n  =Attack on a position prepared for defense.= The commander frames\r\n  his plan of attack according to the results of the reconnaissance,\r\n  and leads his troops forward provisionally into a preparatory\r\n  position, where he assigns deployment spaces and, if practicable,\r\n  combat sections to the different units. In order that they may\r\n  utilize the covering features of the ground to the best advantage,\r\n  the different units are to avoid advancing abreast. On account of\r\n  the difficulties attending an advance over ground swept by hostile\r\n  fire, it is considered desirable for the troops to take advantage\r\n  of the cover afforded by darkness. In order that, in such a case,\r\n  serious lateral displacements of the troops may be avoided, the\r\n  fighting line is to be sent forward the day before to endeavor to\r\n  drive back the troops posted in front of the enemy’s main position.\r\n  The regulations state that, when an attack is contemplated to be\r\n  made during daylight against a strong position prepared for defense,\r\n  there is no alternative but to approach the assaulting position by\r\n  intrenching successive attack positions, but that, when circumstances\r\n  permit, an attempt must be made to advance under cover of darkness to\r\n  the enemy’s position. In the latter case, the assaulting position is\r\n  to be designated during the day, after a thorough reconnaissance, and\r\n  detailed preparations are to be made for the advance. As soon as the\r\n  troops arrive during the night in the selected position, they are to\r\n  construct cover quickly, and to intrench. When the ground is so hard\r\n  that intrenching tools cannot be used without difficulty, recourse is\r\n  to be had to the sand bags that are carried along. The men engaged in\r\n  digging trenches are at all times to be ready for action.\r\n\r\n  The regulations state that whether a force which has occupied an\r\n  assaulting position should make the =assault= immediately at dawn or\r\n  should first prepare it by fire, will depend on circumstances; and\r\n  that, if attempted at dawn, the success of the assault will depend\r\n  on the suddenness and rapidity with which it is carried out. The\r\n  reconnaissance of the position and the work of removing obstacles is\r\n  to be completed, if possible, during the night, so that avenues of\r\n  approach will be open for the assaulting troops.\r\n\r\n  If the reconnaissance has gained all the necessary information, and\r\n  if the preparations are completed, the assault may be made before the\r\n  night is over. The regulations say that, when an assault is made at\r\n  night, the distance to be covered should be very short; and that it\r\n  will depend on circumstances whether the assault is made suddenly,\r\n  directly from the last firing position, or whether it is carried\r\n  out upon the completion of works of approach. When necessary the\r\n  assaulting bodies are to carry along hand grenades and demolition\r\n  tools, the latter being selected in conformity with the results of\r\n  the reconnaissance.\r\n\r\n  The regulations state that to have captured a position does not\r\n  suffice; that only the pursuit and dispersion of the enemy makes the\r\n  victory complete. The troops that have penetrated into the hostile\r\n  position are to continue the advance until they again find a field\r\n  of fire, whereupon they are to fire upon the retreating enemy. The\r\n  troops which do not take part in this fire are to re-form quickly,\r\n  secure the captured position, take requisite measures for security,\r\n  and make preparations to meet any hostile counter-attack. Troops are\r\n  not to be assembled in large bodies at points exposed to hostile\r\n  artillery fire. As soon as the enemy has gotten out of range, all the\r\n  troops are promptly to resume the forward movement, and are to pursue\r\n  him vigorously so far as due regard for cohesion and order permits.\r\n\r\n  =Intrenching tools= are to be used in attacks on fortified positions,\r\n  and in strengthening ground captured from the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSE.\r\n\r\n  In defense, the Japanese regulations, like the German, provide\r\n  for economical occupation of the front (group fortifications) and\r\n  a general reserve, which is to be used offensively or to protect\r\n  the flanks. Dummy intrenchments, patrols, and outposts are to make\r\n  it difficult for the enemy to gain information of the defensive\r\n  position. The Japanese views in regard to =advanced positions= are\r\n  not so pronounced as the German, for, while their regulations mention\r\n  the combat of the outposts pushed forward from the position, the\r\n  danger of advanced positions is not especially emphasized.\r\n\r\n  The training of the soldier is to be such that even after he has\r\n  fired away all of his ammunition, he will still defend his position\r\n  with the bayonet.\r\n\r\n  Nothing is said in regard to the distance of the infantry position\r\n  from that of the artillery. If information is received that the\r\n  attacker has made a lodgment during the night in the assaulting\r\n  position, small detachments are to advance and prevent him from\r\n  strengthening his position.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1907.\r\n\r\n  The present regulations only treat of the formal matters of training\r\n  and combat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWISS DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK.\r\n\r\n  There is considerable similarity between the Swiss and the German\r\n  regulations. The keynote is the offensive. The purpose of the\r\n  combat and the condition of the troops are to govern the commander\r\n  in deciding whether to stand on the defensive or to attack. The\r\n  regulations state that decisive results are only offered by the\r\n  attack; that considerations of a presumable hostile superiority and\r\n  other apparently unfavorable conditions should not diminish the\r\n  energy of the attack; and that the decision to launch the troops\r\n  should never be made dependent upon the receipt of reports in regard\r\n  to the enemy.\r\n\r\n  The offensive is invariably to be assumed, unless the situation\r\n  or the mission compel the force to stand on the defensive. The\r\n  regulations state that, in attack, success does not rest alone upon\r\n  superiority of fire and superiority of numbers; but that an impetuous\r\n  advance and an unswerving determination to win are of just as much\r\n  importance. The conduct of the Swiss attack varies, depending upon\r\n  whether it is made in a rencontre or on a position prepared for\r\n  defense.\r\n\r\n  The views entertained in regard to the =rencontre= coincide with\r\n  the German views. The regulations say that the result of the\r\n  reconnaissance should not be awaited, because success depends largely\r\n  upon prompt action. The commander may launch parts of his main body\r\n  in succession, as soon as they arrive, when the force is operating\r\n  in close country, when it is necessary to gain ground quickly on\r\n  debouching from a defile, or when the enemy makes an impetuous\r\n  advance. The commander is to direct all his efforts toward throwing\r\n  the enemy upon the defensive, and then to launch the main body as an\r\n  entity.\r\n\r\n  The Swiss regulations, similar to those of the Japanese, only\r\n  discuss the =attack on a fortified position=; various modifications\r\n  of the attack, depending upon the preparations made by the enemy,\r\n  are authorized. Advantage is to be taken of the cover afforded by\r\n  darkness, and an extensive use is to be made of =intrenching tools=.\r\n  The regulations state that an assault by day only has a chance of\r\n  succeeding when the defender is completely subdued, and when only\r\n  insignificant obstacles and defenses are encountered. When this is\r\n  not the case, the day is to be used for making preparations for the\r\n  attack, and the night for executing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSE.\r\n\r\n  The regulations consider the involuntary defense in a rencontre; the\r\n  deliberately prepared defense seeking a decision and contemplating\r\n  an assumption of the offensive; the defense for the purpose of\r\n  gaining time; and the occupation of a position in readiness, when the\r\n  direction in which the hostile attack will be made is still in doubt,\r\n  or when the commander intends to assail the enemy while the latter\r\n  is in the act of deploying. In the =defense seeking a decision=,\r\n  advanced positions are not to be used, because it is believed that\r\n  the employment of detachments of troops in front of the defensive\r\n  position will weaken the latter, and a hostile enveloping attack will\r\n  soon force the advanced troops to fall back upon the main position.\r\n  The regulations point out that if the advanced troops are supported\r\n  by fire from the main position, the latter will be prematurely\r\n  disclosed to the assailant. The employment of advanced troops is,\r\n  however, considered justifiable to hold defiles, to deceive the\r\n  enemy, or to support the cavalry.\r\n\r\n  The works of a position are not to be continuous, but are to be\r\n  constructed in groups. Infantry positions over which artillery is to\r\n  fire are not to be less than 500 m. in front of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. THE EXPENDITURE AND SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION.[494]\r\n\r\n    [494] Lieutenant-Colonel KOVARIK, _Versuch eines kriegsbrauchbaren\r\n  Systems für den Munitionsersatz im Infanteriekampf_, Berlin, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HISTORICAL SKETCH.\r\n\r\nThe question of ammunition supply in action is of vital importance to\r\nthe infantry. To solve it correctly means to assure the success of the\r\ninfantry in fire action. The first question that needs consideration\r\nis, whether the experiences of past wars show that the ammunition at\r\npresent carried by the infantry is sufficient, under all circumstances,\r\neven when ammunition columns cannot reach the battlefield in time\r\nbecause all the roads are choked with troops.\r\n\r\n  For our purpose, it is sufficient to go back as far as the\r\n  =Franco-German war=, in which breechloaders were used for the\r\n  first time against breechloaders. Every German soldier carried 80\r\n  cartridges, and the 6-horse battalion ammunition wagons carried 20\r\n  additional rounds per man.[495]\r\n\r\n    [495] Historical data given by D. GÜNTHER in _Die Entwickelung der\r\n  Feuertaktik der Infanterie_, 1902.\r\n\r\n  When one considers the total number of cartridges expended during any\r\n  campaign, it seems impossible that a shortage of ammunition could\r\n  ever have taken place. In the =Franco-German war=, the expenditure\r\n  of ammunition in the Ist Bavarian Army Corps amounted to 4,163,000\r\n  rounds (166 per rifle); in the IInd Army Corps, 1,105,600 rounds (44\r\n  per rifle); and in the Saxon Army Corps, 1,450,000 rounds (about\r\n  58 per rifle). The compilation of a table, showing the amount of\r\n  ammunition expended in the Prussian army, was begun, but was soon\r\n  discontinued, as it was found that the necessary data were lacking,\r\n  the only information available being the record of the number of\r\n  rounds issued by the reserve ammunition parks. The troops sent to\r\n  the field army from the depot battalions, must have brought with\r\n  them in each case a very considerable amount of ammunition, as each\r\n  man carried 80 rounds, but no records are available to show how\r\n  much ammunition was forwarded in this way. Furthermore, there is no\r\n  record of the number of rounds actually expended and of the amount\r\n  of ammunition lost or left on the dead and wounded. It is well known,\r\n  that in the long periods, during which no engagement had taken place,\r\n  an enormous amount of ammunition was lost on marches and in bivouacs.\r\n  This applies likewise to battlefields. The commander of an ammunition\r\n  column had his men pick up 22,000 rounds of needle gun ammunition in\r\n  unbroken packages on the battlefield of =Hühnerwasser=.\r\n\r\n  A shortage of ammunition first manifested itself where the troops,\r\n  on removing their knapsacks, had neglected to take out the tin boxes\r\n  filled with ammunition (for example in the 12th Jäger-Battalion at\r\n  =Sedan=),[496] or where the ammunition wagons had been sent to the\r\n  rear with the field train (for example in the 50th Infantry, on\r\n  January 19th, 1871, in the battle at =Mont Valérien=, and in the 38th\r\n  Brigade, at the battle of =Beaune la Rolande=).[497]\r\n\r\n    [496] _Gen. St. W._, II, p. 1175.\r\n\r\n    [497] HÖNIG, _Volkskrieg_, II, p. 259.\r\n\r\n  The regimental histories contain only a few statements in regard\r\n  to the amount of ammunition expended in the various engagements.\r\n  Moreover, these statements are only approximations and, as a rule,\r\n  cannot lay claim to trustworthiness.\r\n\r\n  The amount of ammunition expended in the opening battles of the war\r\n  was very small, due to the training and fighting methods of the\r\n  Prussian infantry, and to the support it received from the artillery.\r\n  Moreover, the short range of the rifle prohibited long range firing.\r\n\r\n  “In order to hold its own against the intensity and long range of\r\n  the hostile fire, the German infantry was compelled to fire more\r\n  rapidly and at longer ranges than it had intended. In addition, the\r\n  difficulties of fire control and fire direction were frequently\r\n  increased on account of the tremendous loss of leaders. Under these\r\n  circumstances, so much ammunition was expended that, among the troops\r\n  fighting in the first line, the ammunition carried by the men was\r\n  no more than enough. This explains why it not infrequently happened\r\n  that the fighting efficiency of the infantry was impaired by a lack\r\n  of ammunition. The first general shortage of ammunition occurred\r\n  at the battle of =Mars-la-Tour= in the infantry of the IIIrd Army\r\n  Corps.”[498]\r\n\r\n    [498] _Gen. St. W._, V, p. 1460.\r\n\r\n  On August 16th, at the battle of =Vionville=, the Prussian IIIrd Army\r\n  Corps, whose effective strength was 21,050 rifles, expended 720,486\r\n  cartridges, which corresponds to only 34.5 rounds per rifle; yet,\r\n  in spite of this, the ammunition ran short. During the lull in the\r\n  battle at noon, by removing the cartridges from the dead and wounded,\r\n  each man in the 35th Infantry[499] was again supplied with about 200\r\n  rounds of ammunition, which were then expended in the course of the\r\n  afternoon, so that toward evening another shortage occurred.\r\n\r\n    [499] _Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 35_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n  The following figures in regard to the expenditure of ammunition\r\n  during the battle of =Vionville= are taken from _Kriegsgeschichtliche\r\n  Beispiele_, 8 and 9, by Major KUNZ:\r\n\r\n  IInd Bn. Leib Regt.   12,749 rounds for  850 rifles, or  15 per rifle.\r\n  Ist Bn. 40th Inf.     35,000   „     „   450   „     „   78  „    „\r\n  IInd Bn. 40th Inf.     6,650   „     „   350   „     „   19  „    „\r\n  IIIrd Bn. 40th Inf.    4,520   „     „   300   „     „   15  „    „\r\n\r\n  A very annoying shortage of ammunition occurred in those parts of the\r\n  Leib Regiment which were with the 72nd and 40th Infantry Regiments in\r\n  front of the wood. The retained echelons in the wood had sufficient\r\n  ammunition, but the troops in front lacked the means wherewith to\r\n  inform the retained units of the shortage. In the 11th and 72nd\r\n  Infantry Regiments a serious shortage of ammunition occurred after\r\n  they had been engaged but a short time. (In a little less than two\r\n  hours, the 72nd Infantry suffered the following percentage of losses:\r\n  Ist Battalion, 53.2%; Füsilier Battalion, 48.2%).[500]\r\n\r\n    [500] For data in regard to the expenditure of ammunition at\r\n  Beaumont, see HOPFFGARTEN-HEIDLER, _Beaumont_, p. 184.\r\n\r\n  The defense of the stone wall at =Buzanval= by the 50th Infantry\r\n  (German), on January 19th, 1871, was one of the most obstinate\r\n  defensive fights of the war. The numerical superiority of the enemy\r\n  at this point was overwhelming and his troops were excellent,\r\n  nevertheless the regiment maintained the same splendid fire\r\n  discipline it had already exhibited at Lundby. The fight lasted nine\r\n  hours. In his history of the regiment (p. 350), Lieutenant-General v.\r\n  Boguslawski says:\r\n\r\n  “The number of cartridges fired can no longer be accurately\r\n  determined. Only the war diary of the IInd Battalion contains a note\r\n  showing that 14,206 rounds were expended. As the 5th Company did not\r\n  fire at all, and the 7th Company was only partially engaged, by far\r\n  the greater portion of the ammunition must have been expended by the\r\n  6th and 8th Companies.” The IInd Battalion, like the rest, has no\r\n  record showing what ammunition was supplied to it during the battle.\r\n  To cite an example: The 12th Company received about 3,000 rounds of\r\n  ammunition during the fight. As the strength of this company was 180\r\n  men in round numbers, each man received 17 additional cartridges.\r\n  He therefore had 97 rounds available, including the ammunition\r\n  originally supplied him.\r\n\r\n  “Now, as each man still had an average of 5 cartridges on going into\r\n  billets, he must have expended 92 rounds. From this we may assume\r\n  that during the nine hours’ fight, he fired a little more than ten\r\n  rounds per hour.”\r\n\r\n  In the battle of =Beaune la Rolande=, some of the companies of the\r\n  56th Infantry near Romainville had expended all their ammunition. In\r\n  the 38th Brigade, only the Ist Battalion, 57th Infantry, was able\r\n  to replenish its ammunition directly from the ammunition wagons\r\n  near Romainville. The defenders of Beaune did not receive such\r\n  assistance however, as only one ammunition wagon was brought up (by\r\n  the Füsilier-Battalion, 16th Infantry), toward the close of the\r\n  battle, for the units engaged there. The ammunition it contained was\r\n  distributed among the men, but was not used. Organizations belonging\r\n  to the IIIrd Army Corps turned over some of their ammunition, but,\r\n  in general, the brigade had to rely practically on the ammunition\r\n  carried by the men, for all the ammunition wagons had driven off at\r\n  the beginning of the battle. Consequently, this battle was fought\r\n  almost exclusively with the ammunition carried by the men--about\r\n  80 rounds per rifle. As the French attack was not simultaneously\r\n  directed against the whole front of Beaune, lulls occurred in the\r\n  fight, which enabled the officers to send a supply of ammunition\r\n  to the most seriously threatened points of the line. In a well\r\n  disciplined organization, it is not difficult to send ammunition\r\n  promptly to the most seriously threatened points by simply passing\r\n  it along the line. This was actually done at Beaune la Rolande. In\r\n  consequence of this redistribution, at some points in the cemetery,\r\n  men fired as many as 200 rounds each, but others fired only 40 or\r\n  less; the result, however, was the same, for the ammunition was\r\n  almost exclusively supplied from that carried by the men--80 rounds\r\n  per rifle. Moreover, a great many cartridges, and even unopened\r\n  packages of ammunition, were found, on November 29th, in the position\r\n  occupied by the 38th Brigade.\r\n\r\n  The following figures give an idea of the amount of ammunition\r\n  expended at =St. Privat= by the 2nd Regiment of the Guard. On August\r\n  19th, the Ist Battalion required 27,340, the IInd Battalion 17,820,\r\n  and the Füsilier-Battalion 7,870 rounds to replenish their ammunition\r\n  supply. When the heavy losses suffered by this regiment are taken\r\n  into account, the average expenditure of ammunition cannot be\r\n  considered excessive.[501]\r\n\r\n    [501] _Geschichte des 2. Garde-Regiments zu Fusz_, p. 250.\r\n\r\n  At 10:30 P. M., on August 18th, the Rifle Battalion of the Guard\r\n  managed to supply each one of its men with 20 rounds of ammunition,\r\n  without drawing upon the contents of the ammunition wagons, which\r\n  were left intact.[502]\r\n\r\n    [502] _Geschichte des Gardeschützen Bataillons_, p. 121.\r\n\r\n  The expenditure of ammunition on the French side was considerably\r\n  greater in all the battles. At =Champigny=, every French infantry\r\n  soldier carried 118 rounds of ammunition, which did not prove\r\n  sufficient, however, to meet the demand. In the French Army of the\r\n  Rhine, the average expenditure of ammunition from August 6th to 31st\r\n  was 30 rounds, and in the fights of August 16th and 18th, 13 to 27\r\n  rounds per rifle. In individual cases, the expenditure of ammunition\r\n  was far in excess of these figures. The men of Grenier’s Division,\r\n  against which the attack of the 38th Brigade was directed, claim\r\n  that they fired as many as 150 rounds apiece, on August 16th. In\r\n  the evening, at the close of the battle, the commanding general\r\n  of the IVth Army Corps reported a shortage of ammunition.[503]\r\n  Shortage of ammunition caused Marshal Bazaine to fall back to Metz\r\n  on August 17th. Notwithstanding the proximity of the fortress of\r\n  Metz, the French VIth Corps was unable to replenish its supply of\r\n  ammunition before it was attacked by the Prussian Guard. Detailed\r\n  information available in regard to the ammunition expended by the\r\n  25th Infantry (French)[504] shows that each man had only 30 instead\r\n  of 90 cartridges. (This was the regiment attacked by the Franz and\r\n  3rd Guard Regiments, who lost 2,160 men--9% hits). The statement made\r\n  in the history of the 2nd Guard Regiment (p. 233), that every French\r\n  soldier had 300 rounds of ammunition available on August 18th, cannot\r\n  be substantiated by French records.\r\n\r\n    [503] HÖNIG, _Taktik der Zukunft_, p. 159.\r\n\r\n    [504] PAQUIÉ, _Le tir en terrain varié_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n  The expenditure of ammunition in the =Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78=,\r\n  amounted to 33 rounds per rifle and carbine on the Russian side.\r\n  The following detailed statements in regard to the expenditure\r\n  of ammunition are available. In the engagement at =Aiaslar=, on\r\n  August 23rd, 1877, the Sofia Regiment expended 94 rounds, and at\r\n  =Karahassankioi=, the 140th Infantry expended 155 rounds per man.\r\n  On December 28th, 1877, the 13th Rifle Battalion expended 122\r\n  rounds per man. In this connection, it may be remarked that the\r\n  Russian infantryman of that day carried 60 rounds of ammunition in\r\n  his cartridge boxes. The ammunition carts carried 55 additional\r\n  rounds per man, and the ammunition parks 62. If, as prescribed by\r\n  the regulations at that time, only one ammunition wagon followed an\r\n  organization into action, each infantryman had 78 rounds available,\r\n  and each man of a rifle battalion 106 rounds.\r\n\r\n  In front of =Plevna=, on July 20th, 1877, the Russians expended in\r\n  six hours all the ammunition carried by the men and by the ammunition\r\n  carts. On July 30th, during the second assault on =Plevna=, they\r\n  expended in four hours all the ammunition carried by the men.[505]\r\n  In the engagement at =Lovtcha=, the 3rd Rifle Brigade only fired\r\n  during the pursuit. The brigade commander explained afterwards that\r\n  his ammunition had run short nevertheless. During the advance, the\r\n  ammunition wagons did not follow in rear of the organizations to\r\n  which they belonged, and no provision had been made for bringing up\r\n  the necessary ammunition.[506]\r\n\r\n    [505] Details given in the German translation of the Russian _Gen.\r\n  St. W._ (Vienna), III, pp. 330-331.\r\n\r\n    [506] KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den\r\n  Russisch-Türkischen Krieg_, I, p. 88.\r\n\r\n  On September 1st, 1877, the regiments which made the fruitless attack\r\n  on the =Omar Bey Tabia=, expended the following ammunition:\r\n\r\n  63rd  Infantry[507]    55,296 rounds, or  21 per rifle\r\n  119th     „   [507]    99,744   „     „   43  „    „\r\n  64th      „            24,650   „     „   10  „    „\r\n  115th     „            45,360   „     „   24  „    „\r\n\r\n    [507] These two regiments were only engaged from 1 to 1¹⁄₂ hours.\r\n\r\n  In the Kasan Regiment (No. 64), which had expended less ammunition\r\n  than any of the others on this day, the ammunition began to run short\r\n  at the moment when the successful and decisive counter-attack of the\r\n  Turks commenced. The same misfortune befell other organizations,\r\n  after the fire fight had lasted but a comparatively short time, as\r\n  apparently they had neglected to remove the cartridges from the dead\r\n  and wounded.\r\n\r\n  During the assault on =Scheinovo=, on January 9th, 1878, each man of\r\n  the 11th Rifle Battalion fired 120 rounds in four hours. This is an\r\n  average of 2 rounds per man, per minute.\r\n\r\n  The Turks took more advantage of the rapidity of fire of their rifles\r\n  than did the Russians.[508] It is said that at =Gorni Dubniac=, each\r\n  man had 800-900 rounds of ammunition available, and it is a fact,\r\n  that the force of 3,570 men garrisoning the group of works placed\r\n  3,533 Russians out of action, in a fight lasting 9¹⁄₂ hours, while\r\n  the Turkish losses in killed and wounded only amounted to 1,280\r\n  men. During the attack, some Turks managed to fire more than 100\r\n  rounds apiece. Kuropatkin found 120 empty cartridge shells beside\r\n  a dead Turkish soldier.[509] In the engagement at =Tashkessen=\r\n  (31st December, 1877),[510] which lasted eight hours, the Prisrend\r\n  Battalion expended 292, the Tuzla Battalion 275, and a Rifle\r\n  Battalion 263 rounds per man (30 rounds per man, per hour).\r\n\r\n    [508] Each Turkish battalion was followed into action by 30 pack\r\n  mules carrying 60,000 rounds of ammunition, and each man carried from\r\n  100 to 120 rounds on his person.\r\n\r\n    [509] KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER, _Kritische Rückblicke auf den\r\n  Russisch-Türkischen Krieg_, I, p. 170.\r\n\r\n    [510] BAKER, _War in Bulgaria_, II, p. 160.\r\n\r\n  There is very little information available in regard to the\r\n  expenditure of ammunition during the =Russo-Japanese war=. The\r\n  Russian infantryman carried 120 rounds of ammunition, the 8\r\n  one-horse ammunition carts carried 6,600 rounds per company, and\r\n  the 2 two-horse ammunition wagons of the battalions 14,400 rounds\r\n  each. Assuming the strength of a company as 200, this would give 210\r\n  rounds per man. In the engagement at =Hamatan= (=Yalu=), several\r\n  Russian organizations ran entirely out of ammunition. A number of\r\n  rifle companies (the 6th Company, 11th Infantry, and the 2nd, 3rd\r\n  and 4th, 12th Infantry), were able to replenish their supply without\r\n  difficulty from the ammunition wagons. The following is taken from a\r\n  thoroughly reliable report published in the _Kölnische Zeitung_ of\r\n  September 24th, 1905:\r\n\r\n  During the battle of =Liao Yang=, which lasted six days, the 138th\r\n  Infantry fired 99,460, and the 139th Infantry 96,040 rounds. On\r\n  September 1st, the 137th Infantry expended 189,000 rounds, in other\r\n  words, nearly twice as much in one day as either of the other\r\n  regiments expended in six. This excessive expenditure of ammunition\r\n  was due to the very severe attacks which this regiment had to\r\n  withstand on that day. These attacks were repeated on the next day\r\n  and the regiment expended 169,000 rounds of ammunition. From October\r\n  13th to 18th, at =Linshinpu=, the 139th Infantry expended 351,800\r\n  rounds. During this engagement the Japanese succeeded in getting\r\n  within 10 m. of the Russian lines. Thirty bodies were picked up at\r\n  15 paces, and 580 bodies from 100 to 150 paces from the Russian\r\n  position. The 139th Infantry lost 54 men killed, and 6 officers and\r\n  250 men wounded. Major V. Tettau[511] states that during the battle\r\n  of =Liao Yang= (30th August, 1904), the 36th Infantry expended\r\n  416,800 rounds of ammunition, and the 34th Infantry (two battalions),\r\n  250,000 rounds, or for 4,200 Russian rifles an average of not less\r\n  than 160 rounds per rifle.\r\n\r\n    [511] _Achtzehn Monate mit Russlands Heeren in der Mandschurei._\r\n\r\n  The Japanese infantryman carried 120 rounds, and each company had, in\r\n  addition, one two-wheeled ammunition cart carrying 16,000 rounds of\r\n  ammunition. When packs were removed, each man carried a bag in which\r\n  were packed three days’ rations, and from 200 to 250 cartridges. The\r\n  Japanese infantry invariably followed the principle that each man\r\n  should be supplied with as much ammunition as possible before going\r\n  into action. In the engagement at =Kinchau= (26th November, 1904),\r\n  the 1st Infantry Division expended 64, the 3rd 54, and the 4th 143\r\n  rounds per man of the original effective strength.[512]\r\n\r\n    [512] _Streffleur_, _Einzelschriften_, I. p. 224.\r\n\r\nAlthough, according to the examples cited, 100 to 150 rounds of\r\nammunition per man will in general suffice in battle, cases may arise\r\nwhere troops could fire a greater number of rounds to good advantage.\r\nThis must be taken into account when determining the number of rounds\r\nwith which the infantryman should be supplied--on his person and in the\r\nammunition wagons. Moreover, it must be remembered that the supply can\r\nbe replenished without difficulty from the ammunition columns after a\r\nbattle, so long as it is still possible to assign a separate road to\r\neach army corps. When this is no longer practicable, the ammunition\r\ncolumns will encounter almost insurmountable difficulties in supplying\r\nthe infantry with ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMUNITION SUPPLY OF THE PRINCIPAL ARMIES OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n  ========++=======+=====+=======+============+======+=======++\r\n  ~Coun-  ||  Year | Cal-| Weight|   System   |Weight| Weight||\r\n  try.~   ||   of  |iber.|of car-| of loading |  of  |   of  ||\r\n          || con-  |     |tridge.|            | clip.|  clip ||\r\n          || struc-|     |       |            |      |filled.||\r\n          || tion. |     |       |            |      |       ||\r\n          ||       | mm. |   g.  |            |  g.  |  g.   ||\r\n  --------++-------+-----+-------+------------+------+-------++\r\n  ~GER-   ||  1905 | 7.9 | 27.19 |Mag. in rear|   7  |  126  ||\r\n  MANY~   ||   S.  |     |       |of barrel,  |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |loaded with |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |clip holding|      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |5 car-      |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |tridges.    |      |       ||\r\n  --------++-------+-----+-------+------------+------+-------++\r\n  ~AUS-   ||  1895 | 8.  | 28.35 |Mag. in rear|Frame | 158.25||\r\n  TRIA~   ||       |     |       |of barrel,  | 16.5 |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |loaded with |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |frame       |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |holding 5   |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |cartridges. |      |       ||\r\n  --------++-------+-----+-------+------------+------+-------++\r\n  ~ITALY~ ||  1891 | 6.5 | 22.   |Mag. in rear| 12   | 138   ||\r\n          ||Car-   |     |       |of barrel,  |      |       ||\r\n          ||can-   |     |       |loaded with |      |       ||\r\n          ||Mann-  |     |       |frame       |      |       ||\r\n          ||licher.|     |       |holding 6   |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |cartridges. |      |       ||\r\n  --------++-------+-----+-------+------------+------+-------++\r\n  ~ENG-   ||  1908 | 7.71| 27.5  |Mag. in rear| Clip | 150   ||\r\n  LAND~   ||Lee-   |     |       |of barrel,  | 12.5 |       ||\r\n          ||En-    |     |       |loaded with |      |       ||\r\n          ||field. |     |       |clip holding|      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |5 car-      |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |tridges.    |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |[514]       |      |       ||\r\n  --------++-------+-----+-------+------------+------+-------++\r\n  ~FRANCE~|| 1886- | 8.  | 29.   |Mag. under  |  --  |  --   ||\r\n          ||  98,  |     |       |barrel, car-|      |       ||\r\n          ||1905 D |     |       |tridges     |      |       ||\r\n          ||Lebel. |     |       |loaded      |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |singly.     |      |       ||\r\n  --------++-------+-----+-------+------------+------+-------++\r\n  ~RUSSIA~||  1891 | 7.62| 25.812|Mag. in rear|  9.6 | 137   ||\r\n  [516]   ||(Three |     |       |of barrel,  |      |       ||\r\n          ||line   |     |       |loaded with |      |       ||\r\n          ||rifle).|     |       |clip holding|      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |5 car-      |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |tridges.    |      |       ||\r\n  --------++-------+-----+-------+------------+------+-------++\r\n  ~JAPAN~ ||  1897 | 6.50| 22.4  |Mag. in rear|  8.5 | 120   ||\r\n  [516]   ||Arisaka|     |       |of barrel,  |      |       ||\r\n          ||(Meidji|     |       |loaded with |      |       ||\r\n          ||  80). |     |       |clip holding|      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |5 car-      |      |       ||\r\n          ||       |     |       |tridges.    |      |       ||\r\n  --------++-------+-----+-------+------------+------+-------++\r\n\r\n  ========++==================++===========++=================++\r\n  ~Coun-  || Number of rounds || Ammunition|| Number of rounds||\r\n  try.~   || carried by a man.||   wagons. || carried by ammu-||\r\n          ||                  ||           || nition wagons.  ||\r\n          ||                  ||           ||             No. ||\r\n          ||            Weight||           ||       per rifle.||\r\n          ||     No.      kg. ||           ||No.         [513]||\r\n  --------++------------+-----++-----------++-----------+-----++\r\n  ~GER-   ||     150    |     ||4 Company  ||   14,400  | 77  ||\r\n  MANY~   ||N.

REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION IN THE VARIOUS ARMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY.\r\n\r\n(Pars. 479-482 F.S.R.)\r\n\r\nOn the march, it is best to assemble all the company ammunition wagons\r\nof the battalions, as this renders supervision easier, and enables\r\nthe battalion commander to regulate the replenishment of ammunition.\r\nCompanies acting alone, as well as those forming the support of an\r\nadvance guard, are followed by their ammunition wagons. It does not\r\nseem desirable to unite the ammunition wagons of a regiment or of a\r\nbrigade on account of the distance separating the different battalions.\r\nDuring the march to the battlefield, the ammunition should be taken\r\nout of the knapsacks, and the contents of the ammunition wagons\r\ndistributed among the men. The men carry this extra ammunition in their\r\nhaversacks and in their coat and trousers’ pockets, etc.\r\n\r\n  The two-horse company ammunition wagon, Model 1897, has a width of\r\n  track of 1.53 m., and, when empty, weighs 450 kg. Compared with the\r\n  ammunition wagon Model C, 1887, which was originally designed to\r\n  carry ammunition in boxes, it is lighter by 75 kg., and can be turned\r\n  within a shorter radius. The wagon body is provided with double doors\r\n  in front and in rear. The interior is divided into four compartments\r\n  (to be emptied separately), each capable of holding 16 bundles of\r\n  cartridges placed on end. Each bundle contains 15 packages of 15\r\n  cartridges in clips each. Each bundle of 225 cartridges weighs 7.25\r\n  kg.\r\n\r\n  As three bundles of cartridges are to be carried by one man,\r\n  according to the Field Service Regulations (par. 480), 1\r\n  non-commissioned officer and 21 men are detailed to unload the\r\n  ammunition wagon. The unloading is managed as follows: Four men take\r\n  post on each side of the wagon, two handing out the bundles to the\r\n  other two, who lay them on the ground. The remaining men place the\r\n  bundles in piles of three in such a manner that the carrying loops of\r\n  two in each pile can be interlaced and held together by a stick or a\r\n  bayonet. An ammunition wagon can be emptied in this manner in four\r\n  minutes. The two ammunition bundles tied together are slung over the\r\n  left shoulder, the rifle is slung over the right shoulder, and the\r\n  third bundle is carried in the right hand. In this way, a man can\r\n  carry 21.8 kg.\r\n\r\nEach man is issued 60 to 75 cartridges from the ammunition wagon.\r\nThese weigh from 1.8 to 2.4 kg. When issued too soon, this additional\r\nburden causes considerable inconvenience, and consequently reduces\r\nthe marching power of the men. The leader must also decide what shall\r\nbe done with the ammunition in case it has been issued prematurely,\r\nand the troops fail to get into action. As soon as the ammunition\r\nwagons are emptied, they are sent to the rear in charge of the mounted\r\nwagonmaster, and refilled from the ammunition columns. When refilled,\r\nthey rejoin their proper organizations. If requested, ammunition must\r\nbe issued to any body of troops.\r\n\r\nOn the battlefield, ammunition wagons, unless they have been emptied,\r\nfollow the movements of the several companies and take up a position\r\nunder cover, indicated by the wagonmaster, as close as possible to the\r\nfiring line--never more than 800 m. in rear of it. In urgent cases,\r\nthis must be done without regard to losses. The firing line is supplied\r\nwith ammunition, when practicable, by the reinforcements sent forward.\r\nWhen the firing line is about to run short of ammunition, this fact is\r\ncommunicated to the troops in rear by repeatedly making the signal “m”.\r\nThis signal, when made to the front by the troops in rear, signifies,\r\n“ammunition is coming up at once.”\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases, when ammunition must be sent to the firing line\r\nby individual men, the latter should invariably be detailed from troops\r\nin rear which have not as yet been engaged. These men must endeavor to\r\nreach the firing line by rushes or by crawling, and must then remain\r\nwith that line.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the battalion commander to see that the ammunition\r\ntaken from the ammunition wagons is promptly replaced. The higher\r\ncommanders would do well to provide a reserve supply of ammunition,\r\nuntil the arrival of the ammunition columns, by assembling the\r\nammunition wagons of the troops held in reserve. (Par. 482 F. S. R.).\r\nIt will also be advisable to assign some of the ammunition wagons\r\nof the troops held in reserve to the organizations who will, in all\r\nprobability, expend a large amount of ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe ammunition should be removed from the dead and wounded. If this is\r\ndone by the men of an advancing skirmish line, there is danger that the\r\nforward movement will be retarded, and that some of the men will take\r\nadvantage of this opportunity to make themselves “scarce.” Officers\r\nand men should endeavor to replenish ammunition at every opportunity,\r\nwithout awaiting specific orders to that effect, and, in general, see\r\nthat not only the prescribed number of rounds, but, on the contrary, as\r\nmuch ammunition as possible is on hand in the organization.\r\n\r\nWhen the force is to stand on the defensive, especially if the position\r\nto be occupied has been prepared for defense, ammunition should\r\nbe deposited all along the firing line. (Cartridge boxes or other\r\nutensils may be used as receptacles). It is advisable to use first the\r\ncartridges carried in caps, haversacks, coat and trousers’ pockets. The\r\ncontents of the right cartridge box are saved for decisive moments when\r\ngreat rapidity of fire is essential. In replenishing ammunition, the\r\nright cartridge box is filled first, then the left, and the surplus is\r\naccommodated in haversack, coat and trousers’ pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\n\r\n(Par. 70 Regulations of 1903).\r\n\r\n  The regulations are extremely thorough and deserve special attention.\r\n  If an engagement is imminent, each private receives 20 additional\r\n  rounds before leaving the bivouac or reserve position, and each\r\n  non-commissioned officer 100 rounds from the company ammunition\r\n  wagon, so that the latter is about half emptied.[517] This brings\r\n  the total amount carried by each soldier up to 140 rounds, and\r\n  increases the load of the privates by 0.71 kg., and that of the\r\n  non-commissioned officers by about 4 kg. When troops go into action,\r\n  the ammunition wagons are assembled and accompany the battalion\r\n  reserve, taking as much advantage of cover as possible, so that the\r\n  attention of the enemy may not be drawn to them. After the battalion\r\n  reserve has been absorbed by the firing line, the ammunition wagons\r\n  accompany the regimental reserve. When exposed to artillery fire, the\r\n  wagons maintain intervals of twenty paces from one another. They are\r\n  either placed under the orders of the battalion adjutant, or of the\r\n  senior supply officer present with them, as may be directed by the\r\n  battalion commander.\r\n\r\n    [517] The company ammunition wagon carries 9,450 rounds of\r\n  ammunition, packed in seven compartments. It consists of a body and a\r\n  limber, has a width of track of 1.13 m., and is supplied with eight\r\n  sacks which serve to carry ammunition to the troops. During the day\r\n  its position is indicated by a red flag, and at night by a green\r\n  lantern.\r\n\r\n  In attack, it will, as a rule, only be possible to replenish\r\n  ammunition until troops get within about 1,000 paces (750 m.) of the\r\n  enemy. From this point on, however, it will be extremely difficult to\r\n  supply ammunition. Every lull in the fight must be taken advantage\r\n  of to replenish ammunition. The firing line receives a fresh supply\r\n  of ammunition through reinforcements or through small detachments\r\n  under non-commissioned officers sent forward from the reserves. These\r\n  detachments, after distributing the ammunition they have brought\r\n  up, remain with the firing line. The companies engaged in the fire\r\n  fight later take advantage of every opportunity to replenish and to\r\n  redistribute ammunition.\r\n\r\n  In defense, all the ammunition wagons may be emptied before the\r\n  action begins, and sent to the rear to be refilled. The ammunition\r\n  should be deposited in the vicinity of the firing line. The\r\n  subsequent replenishment of the supply should be managed as in an\r\n  attack. If ammunition is very urgently needed by the firing line,\r\n  and when no other remedy suggests itself, a part of the ammunition\r\n  of the reserves may be turned over to the firing line. Special\r\n  detachments should be detailed to remove the ammunition from the\r\n  dead and wounded. Wounded men who are able to walk to the dressing\r\n  station, turn over their ammunition to their comrades.\r\n\r\n  If another organization requests to be furnished ammunition, the\r\n  entire amount required, or a part thereof, depending upon the urgency\r\n  of the case and the amount available, should be turned over to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.[518]\r\n\r\n    [518] In each battalion, the ammunition wagon of the 2nd company\r\n  carries 108 explosive cartridges, weighing 200 g. each, and that of\r\n  the 3rd company carries 48 fuzes.\r\n\r\n  The ammunition carried in the cartridge boxes of the men may prove\r\n  insufficient during an action. On open ground the ammunition\r\n  wagons, assembled by regiment, accompany the regimental reserve,\r\n  and in covered terrain, they are assembled by battalion, and follow\r\n  the battalion reserve. When practicable, their position is to be\r\n  indicated during the day by red flags placed on their flank, and at\r\n  night by green lanterns. In defense, an adequate supply of ammunition\r\n  should be deposited in rear of the firing line, or should be at\r\n  once distributed among the men. In attack, the ammunition supply of\r\n  the firing line and of the supports is to be replenished when they\r\n  enter ranges under 700 m. The best means of preventing shortage of\r\n  ammunition is to husband it at long ranges. Ammunition wagons are not\r\n  to be emptied and their contents distributed before an action begins;\r\n  on the contrary, the ammunition is to be issued during the fight, one\r\n  wagon after another being emptied. Ammunition may be sent forward\r\n  from the reserve to the firing line, the men who carry it remaining\r\n  with that line. On the other hand--and this seems to be the method\r\n  most frequently employed--men from the firing line may be sent to\r\n  the rear for ammunition. The men of the reserves at once turn over\r\n  one-half of their cartridges to these men, who are then assembled and\r\n  sent forward under the command of a non-commissioned officer. The\r\n  ammunition is carried forward in sacks--so-called “bashlicks.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n  Each company has one ammunition wagon, which is a part of the combat\r\n  train (_train de combat_), and carries 16,384 Lebel cartridges, and\r\n  36 intrenching tools. It can carry 19,000 rounds of the new “D”\r\n  ammunition,[519] So long as any ammunition remains in the ammunition\r\n  wagons, they remain under all circumstances with their battalion.\r\n  They are assembled in battalion groups on the left flank of their\r\n  battalion. When the battalion is broken up for advance, flank,\r\n  rear guard, or outpost work, they remain with the main body of the\r\n  battalion. When the companies are separated for a protracted period,\r\n  the battalion commander decides whether or not the ammunition\r\n  wagons should accompany their respective companies. The ammunition\r\n  in the wagons is, as a general rule, to be distributed before the\r\n  commencement of an action. If this is impossible when the force\r\n  is taken by surprise, the commander of the group of ammunition\r\n  wagons must bring them up as close as possible under cover, and\r\n  the battalion commander must supervise the distribution of the\r\n  ammunition. In quarters and on the march, the ammunition is to be\r\n  replenished by taking the ammunition from the sick, from the men\r\n  detailed away, or from the supply carried by the baggage wagon.[520]\r\n  The ammunition in the baggage wagon is only to be used when all these\r\n  other sources are exhausted. When an encounter with the enemy may\r\n  be expected, and only a short march is anticipated, the ammunition\r\n  carried in the baggage wagons may be distributed before starting.\r\n\r\n    [519] The company ammunition wagon Model 1893 weighs 287 kg.\r\n  when empty, and 770 kg. when filled. It carries 14,400 rounds of\r\n  ammunition (net capacity 48%) or 66 rounds per rifle.\r\n\r\n    [520] The baggage wagon weighs 450 kg. when empty, and 1054 kg.\r\n  when loaded. It carries 36 intrenching tools, and a tool chest. Its\r\n  net capacity is 45%. Forty knapsacks may be transported on this wagon\r\n  in lieu of the ammunition.\r\n\r\n  Any further replenishment of ammunition is to be ordered by the\r\n  division commander. The empty company ammunition wagons are assembled\r\n  in regimental groups and follow at least 1,000 m. in rear of the\r\n  regimental reserve. At each halt, the wagon train is to prepare for\r\n  defense. The regimental commander is to regulate the distribution of\r\n  the ammunition sent forward by the ammunition columns.\r\n\r\n  When this distribution cannot be made for some reason or other, the\r\n  wagons, assembled in groups of four, follow their battalions. It is\r\n  the duty of the battalion commander to keep the firing line supplied\r\n  with ammunition. The contents of the company ammunition wagons are\r\n  not to be replenished from the ammunition columns during an action.\r\n  The ammunition is to be removed from the dead and wounded.\r\n\r\n  The source of the ammunition supply is the corps ammunition park,\r\n  which is divided into three echelons, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1st echelon consists of two infantry ammunition columns and marches\r\n  at the head of the combat train of the troops engaged;\r\n\r\n  IInd echelon consists of three infantry ammunition columns;\r\n\r\n  IIIrd echelon carries artillery ammunition only.\r\n\r\n  Two infantry ammunition columns of the 1st echelon, which, as a\r\n  rule, constitutes the “ammunition supply center” at the commencement\r\n  of an action, march at the head of the combat train (_train de\r\n  combat_). A half-filled infantry ammunition column must at all times\r\n  be available at this “ammunition supply center.” Ammunition wagons\r\n  of the infantry ammunition column are sent forward at the request\r\n  of the division commander to the position taken up by the company\r\n  ammunition wagons. The latter are generally posted not more than\r\n  1,000 m. in the rear of the fighting line, and parts of each infantry\r\n  ammunition column (usually one ammunition wagon for each battalion)\r\n  are posted by an officer not more than 1,500 m. in rear of these.\r\n  The empty company ammunition wagons are not refilled, the ammunition\r\n  being sent forward directly from the ammunition columns. As soon as\r\n  the infantry ammunition columns are informed which organizations they\r\n  are to supply, they send out non-commissioned officers to locate the\r\n  ammunition wagons of those organizations and establish communication\r\n  with them. The commander of the ammunition column directs where empty\r\n  ammunition wagons are to assemble. In emergencies, wagons of the\r\n  infantry ammunition column may also drive close up to the fighting\r\n  line. In this case, empty wagons assemble near the groups of company\r\n  ammunition wagons, and from there they are sent back in trains to the\r\n  ammunition column to which they belong.\r\n\r\n  Every opportunity, such as a lull in the fight, or an abatement of\r\n  the hostile fire, etc., must be utilized to distribute the ammunition\r\n  of the company wagons or of the ammunition column.\r\n\r\n  It is prohibited to send wagons or men to the rear for the purpose of\r\n  bringing up ammunition on the battlefield. All men sent forward with\r\n  ammunition should remain in the firing line.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND.\r\n\r\n  The British infantryman is usually provided with 115, and each\r\n  machine gun with 3,500 rounds of ammunition. Each battalion is, in\r\n  addition, provided with 8 pack animals, each carrying two ammunition\r\n  chests containing 4,400 cartridges (77 kg.), and with 8 ammunition\r\n  wagons.\r\n\r\n  On the march, the pack animals and half of the ammunition wagons\r\n  follow immediately in rear of the battalion. The (16) remaining\r\n  wagons form a reserve ammunition column at the disposal of the\r\n  brigade commander, and march at the tail of the brigade. When an\r\n  engagement is anticipated, 50 additional rounds (1.3 kg.) may be\r\n  issued to each man before leaving camp. During an action, one pack\r\n  animal and two ammunition wagons follow each half-battalion. Empty\r\n  company ammunition wagons are refilled from the brigade reserve\r\n  ammunition column. When the wagons of the latter are empty, they are\r\n  replaced by filled wagons from the ammunition column. The teams are\r\n  not transferred with the wagons, but remain with the organization to\r\n  which they belong.\r\n\r\n  Ammunition wagons are expected to approach to within about 900\r\n  m. of the firing line, and pack animals to within 450 m. One\r\n  non-commissioned officer and two or three privates are to be detailed\r\n  from each company to bring up ammunition. Each man is to carry a sack\r\n  containing 600 cartridges (16 kg.). That this method of supplying\r\n  ammunition is practicable under fire is shown by the distinguished\r\n  conduct lists for =Paardeberg=, where men were praised or decorated\r\n  for endurance and fearlessness in bringing up ammunition. (See p. 371\r\n  supra). The men who bring up ammunition may be kept in the firing\r\n  line when the ground is devoid of cover.\r\n\r\n  The division ammunition columns, although they carry both infantry\r\n  and artillery ammunition, constitute an integral part of the\r\n  artillery battalions.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\n  When an encounter with the enemy is anticipated, the ammunition\r\n  wagons are to be emptied, the men detailed to carry ammunition are\r\n  to remove their packs, and each one of them is to carry ammunition\r\n  weighing about 7.5 kg.\r\n\r\n  The packs are to be removed only in case of urgent necessity.\r\n  When this is ordered, however, the soldier first removes all the\r\n  cartridges and the emergency ration from his pack. The ammunition\r\n  knapsacks, which are always to be taken along, are, however, carried\r\n  in turn by all the soldiers of the company.\r\n\r\n  The advancing units that are in need of ammunition, may demand it\r\n  from troops ordered to remain behind. They take along their own\r\n  ammunition carriers. The latter, assembled in a squad, distribute the\r\n  ammunition along the firing line, and remain with that line. In the\r\n  first lull that occurs, they assemble again as a squad and take part\r\n  as such in the action.\r\n\r\n  The empty ammunition knapsacks belonging to organizations in reserve\r\n  are to be refilled as rapidly as possible from the ammunition wagons\r\n  sent forward from the ammunition park to the fighting line.\r\n\r\n  The ammunition of the dead and wounded is to be removed ind\r\n  distributed among the remaining men. During pauses in the fire, the\r\n  ammunition is to be equalized in all organizations engaged in the\r\n  fire fight.\r\n\r\n  The ammunition wagons of the echelons in rear are to approach the\r\n  fighting line as far as the available cover permits. Their position\r\n  is to be indicated by flags. The ammunition carriers are to come to\r\n  these wagons to refill the empty ammunition knapsacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. WHAT DEDUCTIONS MAY BE MADE FROM THE REGULATIONS OF THE VARIOUS\r\nARMIES.\r\n\r\n1. The contents of the ammunition wagons should be distributed at the\r\ncommencement of an action. This should not be done too early as the\r\npacking and unpacking of ammunition takes time, and as the soldier\r\nwill not march so well when loaded down at the wrong time with 60 to\r\n75 additional cartridges (1.8 to 2.4 kg.), unequally distributed in\r\nhaversack and pockets. It is also a good plan to issue as many rounds\r\nof ammunition to the non-commissioned officers as to the men. During a\r\nfight this ammunition can then be distributed to the men.\r\n\r\n2. As soon as the ammunition wagons have been refilled from the\r\nammunition columns, which have been brought up, they should at once\r\nendeavor to rejoin their battalions and should then follow as close\r\nas possible in rear of the latter. The expenditure of ammunition\r\nwill never be equally distributed along the line; therefore, if the\r\nbattalion commander retains all four ammunition wagons directly under\r\nhis own orders, he will be better able to equalize the supply of\r\nammunition than would be the case if each ammunition wagon, as soon as\r\nit is refilled, were to follow its own company, which, in many cases,\r\nit will scarcely find again.\r\n\r\n3. It is the duty of the commander to assign a few ammunition wagons\r\nbelonging to organizations held in reserve to bodies of troops which\r\nwill in all probability need a greater quantity of ammunition.\r\n\r\n4. The organization must be in possession of an adequate supply of\r\nammunition on entering the zone of effective fire, i.e., at a distance\r\nof 600 m. from the enemy. The sending of individual men to the rear\r\nfor the purpose of bringing up ammunition will only be practicable\r\nin rare cases. As a rule, the violence of the hostile fire will make\r\nthis impossible. Only the best men can be sent back. It is asking too\r\nmuch to expect them to cross twice the zone swept by hostile fire.\r\nMoreover, the best men are needed in the firing line to encourage\r\nthe weaker element, and to replace disabled squad leaders. Under no\r\ncircumstances should the firing line be withdrawn to get ammunition\r\nfrom the ammunition wagons, as an attack made unexpectedly by the enemy\r\nmight find the position unoccupied and thus cause its loss.[521] It is\r\na general principle that ammunition must be sent forward from the rear.\r\n\r\n    [521] Examples: The loss of the park at Coulmiers (HELVIG, _Das 1.\r\n  bayerische Armeekorps_, p. 202). The engagement at Daix on January\r\n  21st, 1871 (_Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 61_, p. 174). KUNZ,\r\n  _Loigny-Poupry_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n5. The ammunition can be removed from the dead and wounded only\r\nin defense, or in attack when the forward movement has come to a\r\nstandstill. In an advance, it cannot be done without retarding the\r\nmovement and without affording individual men an excuse to remain\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n6. The bringing up of ammunition by individual men, left to their\r\nown devises, is not to be recommended, as it facilitates “shirking”;\r\nmoreover, if one of the men is disabled, the ammunition he carries\r\nwill never reach the firing line. Ammunition should either be sent\r\nto the firing line with each support, or it should be carried by\r\ndetachments sent forward in thin skirmish lines under the command of\r\nnon-commissioned officers. These detachments should remain with the\r\nfiring line.\r\n\r\n7. Whether or not signals for informing the troops in rear of a\r\nshortage of ammunition in the firing line will fulfill the expectations\r\nentertained for them, can only be determined by the test of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  ACCELERATED FIRE, effect of                                        162\r\n\r\n  ACCELERATED TIME, in various armies (tables)

this text is that of the printed book, including\r\n  the use of inconsistent, erroneous, unusual or archaic spelling,\r\n  hyphenation, capitalisation, punctuation, etc., except as indicated\r\n  under Changes below. This applies to proper and geographical names\r\n  and non-English words and phrases as well; accents and diacriticals\r\n  have not been added or corrected unless mentioned below.\r\n\r\n  The use of physical units has not been corrected; for example, the\r\n  author regularly uses m for speed, kgm for energy, etc.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the abbreviations given on page xxi, the book\r\n  regularly uses differently abbreviated or shortened titles (sometimes\r\n  single words) or translations of references; this has not been\r\n  standardised.\r\n\r\n  Page ix, Table of Contents: the differences between the Table of\r\n  Contents and the headings in the text have not been rectified. Apart\r\n  from (minor) differences in wording, not all headings in the text\r\n  occur in the Table of Contents, and not all entries in the Table of\r\n  Contents occur as headings in the text. Any auto-generated Table of\r\n  Contents may therefore differ from the one on page ix ff.\r\n\r\n  Page 71, “in double column of twice the width of front”: the source\r\n  document was unclear at this point, the text might also have read “in\r\n  double column or twice the width of front”.\r\n\r\n  Page 183, 187: (Général) Le Joindre is the author of the publication,\r\n  but his name is presented here as part of the title.\r\n\r\n  Page 195, troop diagram: due to width restrictions, the diagram had\r\n  to be split into two rows (as it was in the printed book).\r\n\r\n  Page 475: The table appears to contain totals that do not agree with\r\n  the data provided. Since it is not clear where the error was made,\r\n  these calculations have been left as they were: row Germany, last\r\n  column; row Austria, last column but one; row France, last column.\r\n\r\n  The table contains footnote markers, but there are no corresponding\r\n  footnotes on this or the following pages. In an earlier edition of\r\n  the book, the footnotes (using the numbering from the table in this\r\n  text) were as follows:\r\n\r\n  [513] The strength of a company is assumed as 200 men (England\r\n        excepted).\r\n  [514] 10 Cartridges packed in a box.\r\n  [515] New “D” ammunition.\r\n  [516] During the Russo-Japanese war.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Changes made\r\n\r\n  Some minor obvious typographical and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected silently; some tables have been split or re-arranged for\r\n  better readability.\r\n\r\n  Footnotes and illustrations have been moved outside text paragraphs.\r\n\r\n  Spaced and non-spaced and italicised or regular “i.e.”\r\n  and “Ibid./ibid.” have been standardised to “_i.e._” and\r\n  “_Ibid._”/“_ibid._” “Minarelli Fitzgerald” has been standardised to\r\n  “Minarelli-Fitzgerald”.\r\n\r\n  Page 8: “sans le comprendre” and “sans le faire” changed to “sans la\r\n  comprendre” and “sans la faire”.\r\n\r\n  Various pages: “Wald und Ortsgefecht” and “Gruppen und\r\n  Einheitsangriff” have been changed to “Wald- und Ortsgefecht“ and\r\n  “Gruppen- und Einheitsangriff”.\r\n\r\n  Page 11, footnote [18]: opening quote marks inserted before When one\r\n  attempts ....\r\n\r\n  Page 93: closing quote marks inserted after ...
