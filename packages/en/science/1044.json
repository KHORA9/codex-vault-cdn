Mind you, had been whizzing through space all that time, like a\r\ncomet.  _Like_ a comet!  Why, Peters, I laid over the lot of them!  Of\r\ncourse there warn’t any of them going my way, as a steady thing, you\r\nknow, because they travel in a long circle like the loop of a lasso,\r\nwhereas I was pointed as straight as a dart for the Hereafter; but I\r\nhappened on one every now and then that was going my way for an hour or\r\nso, and then we had a bit of a brush together.  But it was generally\r\npretty one-sided, because I sailed by them the same as if they were\r\nstanding still.  An ordinary comet don’t make more than about 200,000\r\nmiles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort—like\r\nEncke’s and Halley’s comets, for instance—it warn’t anything but just a\r\nflash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn’t rightly call it a race.  It\r\nwas as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.\r\nBut after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a\r\ncomet occasionally that was something _like_.  _We_ haven’t got any such\r\ncomets—ours don’t begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round\r\ngait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor—I judged I was\r\ngoing about a million miles a minute—it might have been more, it couldn’t\r\nhave been less—when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three\r\npoints off my starboard bow.  By his stern lights I judged he was bearing\r\nabout northeast-and-by-north-half-east.  Well, it was so near my course\r\nthat I wouldn’t throw away the chance; so I fell off a point, steadied my\r\nhelm, and went for him.  You should have heard me whiz, and seen the\r\nelectric fur fly!  In about a minute and a half I was fringed out with an\r\nelectrical nimbus that flamed around for miles and miles and lit up all\r\nspace like broad day.  The comet was burning blue in the distance, like a\r\nsickly torch, when I first sighted him, but he begun to grow bigger and\r\nbigger as I crept up on him.  I slipped up on him so fast that when I had\r\ngone about 150,000,000 miles I was close enough to be swallowed up in the\r\nphosphorescent glory of his wake, and I couldn’t see anything for the\r\nglare.  Thinks I, it won’t do to run into him, so I shunted to one side\r\nand tore along.  By and by I closed up abreast of his tail.  Do you know\r\nwhat it was like?  It was like a gnat closing up on the continent of\r\nAmerica.  I forged along.  By and by I had sailed along his coast for a\r\nlittle upwards of a hundred and fifty million miles, and then I could see\r\nby the shape of him that I hadn’t even got up to his waistband yet.  Why,\r\nPeters, _we_ don’t know anything about comets, down here.  If you want to\r\nsee comets that _are_ comets, you’ve got to go outside of our solar\r\nsystem—where there’s room for them, you understand.  My friend, I’ve seen\r\ncomets out there that couldn’t even lay down inside the _orbits_ of our\r\nnoblest comets without their tails hanging over.\r\n\r\nWell, I boomed along another hundred and fifty million miles, and got up\r\nabreast his shoulder, as you may say.  I was feeling pretty fine, I tell\r\nyou; but just then I noticed the officer of the deck come to the side and\r\nhoist his glass in my direction.  Straight off I heard him sing\r\nout—“Below there, ahoy!  Shake her up, shake her up!  Heave on a hundred\r\nmillion billion tons of brimstone!”\r\n\r\n“Ay-ay, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Pipe the stabboard watch!  All hands on deck!”\r\n\r\n“Ay-ay, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Send two hundred thousand million men aloft to shake out royals and\r\nsky-scrapers!”\r\n\r\n“Ay-ay, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Hand the stuns’ls!  Hang out every rag you’ve got!  Clothe her from stem\r\nto rudder-post!”\r\n\r\n“Ay-ay, sir!”\r\n\r\nIn about a second I begun to see I’d woke up a pretty ugly customer,\r\nPeters.  In less than ten seconds that comet was just a blazing cloud of\r\nred-hot canvas.  It was piled up into the heavens clean out of sight—the\r\nold thing seemed to swell out and occupy all space; the sulphur smoke\r\nfrom the furnaces—oh, well, nobody can describe the way it rolled and\r\ntumbled up into the skies, and nobody can half describe the way it smelt.\r\nNeither can anybody begin to describe the way that monstrous craft begun\r\nto crash along.  And such another powwow—thousands of bo’s’n’s whistles\r\nscreaming at once, and a crew like the populations of a hundred thousand\r\nworlds like ours all swearing at once.  Well, I never heard the like of\r\nit before.\r\n\r\nWe roared and thundered along side by side, both doing our level best,\r\nbecause I’d never struck a comet before that could lay over me, and so I\r\nwas bound to beat this one or break something.  I judged I had some\r\nreputation in space, and I calculated to keep it.  I noticed I wasn’t\r\ngaining as fast, now, as I was before, but still I was gaining.  There\r\nwas a power of excitement on board the comet.  Upwards of a hundred\r\nbillion passengers swarmed up from below and rushed to the side and begun\r\nto bet on the race.  Of course this careened her and damaged her speed.\r\nMy, but wasn’t the mate mad!  He jumped at that crowd, with his trumpet\r\nin his hand, and sung out—\r\n\r\n“Amidships! amidships, you—! {9} or I’ll brain the last idiot of you!”\r\n\r\nWell, sir, I gained and gained, little by little, till at last I went\r\nskimming sweetly by the magnificent old conflagration’s nose.  By this\r\ntime the captain of the comet had been rousted out, and he stood there in\r\nthe red glare for’ard, by the mate, in his shirt-sleeves and slippers,\r\nhis hair all rats’ nests and one suspender hanging, and how sick those\r\ntwo men did look!  I just simply couldn’t help putting my thumb to my\r\nnose as I glided away and singing out:\r\n\r\n“Ta-ta! ta-ta!  Any word to send to your family?”\r\n\r\nPeters, it was a mistake.  Yes, sir, I’ve often regretted that—it was a\r\nmistake.  You see, the captain had given up the race, but that remark was\r\ntoo tedious for him—he couldn’t stand it.  He turned to the mate, and\r\nsays he—\r\n\r\n“Have we got brimstone enough of our own to make the trip?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Sure?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir—more than enough.”\r\n\r\n“How much have we got in cargo for Satan?”\r\n\r\n“Eighteen hundred thousand billion quintillions of kazarks.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, let his boarders freeze till the next comet comes.\r\nLighten ship!  Lively, now, lively, men!  Heave the whole cargo\r\noverboard!”\r\n\r\nPeters, look me in the eye, and be calm.  I found out, over there, that a\r\nkazark is exactly the bulk of a _hundred and sixty-nine worlds like\r\nours_!  They hove all that load overboard.  When it fell it wiped out a\r\nconsiderable raft of stars just as clean as if they’d been candles and\r\nsomebody blowed them out.  As for the race, that was at an end.  The\r\nminute she was lightened the comet swung along by me the same as if I was\r\nanchored.  The captain stood on the stern, by the after-davits, and put\r\nhis thumb to his nose and sung out—\r\n\r\n“Ta-ta! ta-ta!  Maybe _you’ve_ got some message to send your friends in\r\nthe Everlasting Tropics!”\r\n\r\nThen he hove up his other suspender and started for’ard, and inside of\r\nthree-quarters of an hour his craft was only a pale torch again in the\r\ndistance.  Yes, it was a mistake, Peters—that remark of mine.  I don’t\r\nreckon I’ll ever get over being sorry about it.  I’d ’a’ beat the bully\r\nof the firmament if I’d kept my mouth shut.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nBut I’ve wandered a little off the track of my tale; I’ll get back on my\r\ncourse again.  Now you see what kind of speed I was making.  So, as I\r\nsaid, when I had been tearing along this way about thirty years I begun\r\nto get uneasy.  Oh, it was pleasant enough, with a good deal to find out,\r\nbut then it was kind of lonesome, you know.  Besides, I wanted to get\r\nsomewhere.  I hadn’t shipped with the idea of cruising forever.  First\r\noff, I liked the delay, because I judged I was going to fetch up in\r\npretty warm quarters when I got through; but towards the last I begun to\r\nfeel that I’d rather go to—well, most any place, so as to finish up the\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nWell, one night—it was always night, except when I was rushing by some\r\nstar that was occupying the whole universe with its fire and its\r\nglare—light enough then, of course, but I necessarily left it behind in a\r\nminute or two and plunged into a solid week of darkness again.  The stars\r\nain’t so close together as they look to be.  Where was I?  Oh yes; one\r\nnight I was sailing along, when I discovered a tremendous long row of\r\nblinking lights away on the horizon ahead.  As I approached, they begun\r\nto tower and swell and look like mighty furnaces.  Says I to myself—\r\n\r\n“By George, I’ve arrived at last—and at the wrong place, just as I\r\nexpected!”\r\n\r\nThen I fainted.  I don’t know how long I was insensible, but it must have\r\nbeen a good while, for, when I came to, the darkness was all gone and\r\nthere was the loveliest sunshine and the balmiest, fragrantest air in its\r\nplace.  And there was such a marvellous world spread out before me—such a\r\nglowing, beautiful, bewitching country.  The things I took for furnaces\r\nwere gates, miles high, made all of flashing jewels, and they pierced a\r\nwall of solid gold that you couldn’t see the top of, nor yet the end of,\r\nin either direction.  I was pointed straight for one of these gates, and\r\na-coming like a house afire.  Now I noticed that the skies were black\r\nwith millions of people, pointed for those gates.  What a roar they made,\r\nrushing through the air!  The ground was as thick as ants with people,\r\ntoo—billions of them, I judge.\r\n\r\nI lit.  I drifted up to a gate with a swarm of people, and when it was my\r\nturn the head clerk says, in a business-like way—\r\n\r\n“Well, quick!  Where are you from?”\r\n\r\n“San Francisco,” says I.\r\n\r\n“San Fran—_what_?” says he.\r\n\r\n“San Francisco.”\r\n\r\nHe scratched his head and looked puzzled, then he says—\r\n\r\n“Is it a planet?”\r\n\r\nBy George, Peters, think of it!  “_Planet_?” says I; “it’s a city.  And\r\nmoreover, it’s one of the biggest and finest and—”\r\n\r\n“There, there!” says he, “no time here for conversation.  We don’t deal\r\nin cities here.  Where are you from in a _general_ way?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” I says, “I beg your pardon.  Put me down for California.”\r\n\r\nI had him _again_, Peters!  He puzzled a second, then he says, sharp and\r\nirritable—\r\n\r\n“I don’t know any such planet—is it a constellation?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my goodness!” says I.  “Constellation, says you?  No—it’s a State.”\r\n\r\n“Man, we don’t deal in States here.  _Will_ you tell me where you are\r\nfrom _in general—at large_, don’t you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, now I get your idea,” I says.  “I’m from America,—the United States\r\nof America.”\r\n\r\nPeters, do you know I had him _again_?  If I hadn’t I’m a clam!  His face\r\nwas as blank as a target after a militia shooting-match.  He turned to an\r\nunder clerk and says—\r\n\r\n“Where is America?  _What_ is America?”\r\n\r\nThe under clerk answered up prompt and says—\r\n\r\n“There ain’t any such orb.”\r\n\r\n“_Orb_?” says I.  “Why, what are you talking about, young man?  It ain’t\r\nan orb; it’s a country; it’s a continent.  Columbus discovered it; I\r\nreckon likely you’ve heard of _him_, anyway.  America—why, sir, America—”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” says the head clerk.  “Once for all, where—are—you—_from_?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “I don’t know anything more to say—unless I lump things,\r\nand just say I’m from the world.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” says he, brightening up, “now that’s something like!  _What_\r\nworld?”\r\n\r\nPeters, he had _me_, that time.  I looked at him, puzzled, he looked at\r\nme, worried.  Then he burst out—\r\n\r\n“Come, come, what world?”\r\n\r\nSays I, “Why, _the_ world, of course.”\r\n\r\n“_The_ world!” he says.  “H’m! there’s billions of them! . . . Next!”\r\n\r\nThat meant for me to stand aside.  I done so, and a sky-blue man with\r\nseven heads and only one leg hopped into my place.  I took a walk.  It\r\njust occurred to me, then, that all the myriads I had seen swarming to\r\nthat gate, up to this time, were just like that creature.  I tried to run\r\nacross somebody I was acquainted with, but they were out of acquaintances\r\nof mine just then.  So I thought the thing all over and finally sidled\r\nback there pretty meek and feeling rather stumped, as you may say.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said the head clerk.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” I says, pretty humble, “I don’t seem to make out which world\r\nit is I’m from.  But you may know it from this—it’s the one the Saviour\r\nsaved.”\r\n\r\nHe bent his head at the Name.  Then he says, gently—\r\n\r\n“The worlds He has saved are like to the gates of heaven in number—none\r\ncan count them.  What astronomical system is your world in?—perhaps that\r\nmay assist.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the one that has the sun in it—and the moon—and Mars”—he shook his\r\nhead at each name—hadn’t ever heard of them, you see—“and Neptune—and\r\nUranus—and Jupiter—”\r\n\r\n“Hold on!” says he—“hold on a minute!  Jupiter . . . Jupiter . . . Seems\r\nto me we had a man from there eight or nine hundred years ago—but people\r\nfrom that system very seldom enter by this gate.”  All of a sudden he\r\nbegun to look me so straight in the eye that I thought he was going to\r\nbore through me.  Then he says, very deliberate, “Did you come _straight\r\nhere_ from your system?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” I says—but I blushed the least little bit in the world when I\r\nsaid it.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me very stern, and says—\r\n\r\n“That is not true; and this is not the place for prevarication.  You\r\nwandered from your course.  How did that happen?”\r\n\r\nSays I, blushing again—\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, and I take back what I said, and confess.  I raced a little\r\nwith a comet one day—only just the least little bit—only the tiniest\r\nlit—”\r\n\r\n“So—so,” says he—and without any sugar in his voice to speak of.\r\n\r\nI went on, and says—\r\n\r\n“But I only fell off just a bare point, and I went right back on my\r\ncourse again the minute the race was over.”\r\n\r\n“No matter—that divergence has made all this trouble.  It has brought you\r\nto a gate that is billions of leagues from the right one.  If you had\r\ngone to your own gate they would have known all about your world at once\r\nand there would have been no delay.  But we will try to accommodate you.”\r\nHe turned to an under clerk and says—\r\n\r\n“What system is Jupiter in?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember, sir, but I think there is such a planet in one of the\r\nlittle new systems away out in one of the thinly worlded corners of the\r\nuniverse.  I will see.”\r\n\r\nHe got a balloon and sailed up and up and up, in front of a map that was\r\nas big as Rhode Island.  He went on up till he was out of sight, and by\r\nand by he came down and got something to eat and went up again.  To cut a\r\nlong story short, he kept on doing this for a day or two, and finally he\r\ncame down and said he thought he had found that solar system, but it\r\nmight be fly-specks.  So he got a microscope and went back.  It turned\r\nout better than he feared.  He had rousted out our system, sure enough.\r\nHe got me to describe our planet and its distance from the sun, and then\r\nhe says to his chief—\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know the one he means, now, sir.  It is on the map.  It is called\r\nthe Wart.”\r\n\r\nSays I to myself, “Young man, it wouldn’t be wholesome for you to go down\r\n_there_ and call it the Wart.”\r\n\r\nWell, they let me in, then, and told me I was safe forever and wouldn’t\r\nhave any more trouble.\r\n\r\nThen they turned from me and went on with their work, the same as if they\r\nconsidered my case all complete and shipshape.  I was a good deal\r\nsurprised at this, but I was diffident about speaking up and reminding\r\nthem.  I did so hate to do it, you know; it seemed a pity to bother them,\r\nthey had so much on their hands.  Twice I thought I would give up and let\r\nthe thing go; so twice I started to leave, but immediately I thought what\r\na figure I should cut stepping out amongst the redeemed in such a rig,\r\nand that made me hang back and come to anchor again.  People got to eying\r\nme—clerks, you know—wondering why I didn’t get under way.  I couldn’t\r\nstand this long—it was too uncomfortable.  So at last I plucked up\r\ncourage and tipped the head clerk a signal.  He says—\r\n\r\n“What! you here yet?  What’s wanting?”\r\n\r\nSays I, in a low voice and very confidential, making a trumpet with my\r\nhands at his ear—\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon, and you mustn’t mind my reminding you, and seeming to\r\nmeddle, but hain’t you forgot something?”\r\n\r\nHe studied a second, and says—\r\n\r\n“Forgot something? . . . No, not that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“Think,” says I.\r\n\r\nHe thought.  Then he says—\r\n\r\n“No, I can’t seem to have forgot anything.  What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Look at me,” says I, “look me all over.”\r\n\r\nHe done it.\r\n\r\n“Well?” says he.\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “you don’t notice anything?  If I branched out amongst\r\nthe elect looking like this, wouldn’t I attract considerable\r\nattention?—wouldn’t I be a little conspicuous?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he says, “I don’t see anything the matter.  What do you lack?”\r\n\r\n“Lack!  Why, I lack my harp, and my wreath, and my halo, and my\r\nhymn-book, and my palm branch—I lack everything that a body naturally\r\nrequires up here, my friend.”\r\n\r\nPuzzled?  Peters, he was the worst puzzled man you ever saw.  Finally he\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n“Well, you seem to be a curiosity every way a body takes you.  I never\r\nheard of these things before.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the man awhile in solid astonishment; then I says—\r\n\r\n“Now, I hope you don’t take it as an offence, for I don’t mean any, but\r\nreally, for a man that has been in the Kingdom as long as I reckon you\r\nhave, you do seem to know powerful little about its customs.”\r\n\r\n“Its customs!” says he.  “Heaven is a large place, good friend.  Large\r\nempires have many and diverse customs.  Even small dominions have, as you\r\ndoubtless know by what you have seen of the matter on a small scale in\r\nthe Wart.  How can you imagine I could ever learn the varied customs of\r\nthe countless kingdoms of heaven?  It makes my head ache to think of it.\r\nI know the customs that prevail in those portions inhabited by peoples\r\nthat are appointed to enter by my own gate—and hark ye, that is quite\r\nenough knowledge for one individual to try to pack into his head in the\r\nthirty-seven millions of years I have devoted night and day to that\r\nstudy.  But the idea of learning the customs of the whole appalling\r\nexpanse of heaven—O man, how insanely you talk!  Now I don’t doubt that\r\nthis odd costume you talk about is the fashion in that district of heaven\r\nyou belong to, but you won’t be conspicuous in this section without it.”\r\n\r\nI felt all right, if that was the case, so I bade him good-day and left.\r\nAll day I walked towards the far end of a prodigious hall of the office,\r\nhoping to come out into heaven any moment, but it was a mistake.  That\r\nhall was built on the general heavenly plan—it naturally couldn’t be\r\nsmall.  At last I got so tired I couldn’t go any farther; so I sat down\r\nto rest, and begun to tackle the queerest sort of strangers and ask for\r\ninformation, but I didn’t get any; they couldn’t understand my language,\r\nand I could not understand theirs.  I got dreadfully lonesome.  I was so\r\ndown-hearted and homesick I wished a hundred times I never had died.  I\r\nturned back, of course.  About noon next day, I got back at last and was\r\non hand at the booking-office once more.  Says I to the head clerk—\r\n\r\n“I begin to see that a man’s got to be in his own Heaven to be happy.”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly correct,” says he.  “Did you imagine the same heaven would\r\nsuit all sorts of men?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I had that idea—but I see the foolishness of it.  Which way am I\r\nto go to get to my district?”\r\n\r\nHe called the under clerk that had examined the map, and he gave me\r\ngeneral directions.  I thanked him and started; but he says—\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute; it is millions of leagues from here.  Go outside and\r\nstand on that red wishing-carpet; shut your eyes, hold your breath, and\r\nwish yourself there.”\r\n\r\n“I’m much obliged,” says I; “why didn’t you dart me through when I first\r\narrived?”\r\n\r\n“We have a good deal to think of here; it was your place to think of it\r\nand ask for it.  Good-by; we probably sha’n’t see you in this region for\r\na thousand centuries or so.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, _o revoor_,” says I.\r\n\r\nI hopped onto the carpet and held my breath and shut my eyes and wished I\r\nwas in the booking-office of my own section.  The very next instant a\r\nvoice I knew sung out in a business kind of a way—\r\n\r\n“A harp and a hymn-book, pair of wings and a halo, size 13, for Cap’n Eli\r\nStormfield, of San Francisco!—make him out a clean bill of health, and\r\nlet him in.”\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes.  Sure enough, it was a Pi Ute Injun I used to know in\r\nTulare County; mighty good fellow—I remembered being at his funeral,\r\nwhich consisted of him being burnt and the other Injuns gauming their\r\nfaces with his ashes and howling like wildcats.  He was powerful glad to\r\nsee me, and you may make up your mind I was just as glad to see him, and\r\nfeel that I was in the right kind of a heaven at last.\r\n\r\nJust as far as your eye could reach, there was swarms of clerks, running\r\nand bustling around, tricking out thousands of Yanks and Mexicans and\r\nEnglish and Arabs, and all sorts of people in their new outfits; and when\r\nthey gave me my kit and I put on my halo and took a look in the glass, I\r\ncould have jumped over a house for joy, I was so happy.  “Now _this_ is\r\nsomething like!” says I.  “Now,” says I, “I’m all right—show me a cloud.”\r\n\r\nInside of fifteen minutes I was a mile on my way towards the cloud-banks\r\nand about a million people along with me.  Most of us tried to fly, but\r\nsome got crippled and nobody made a success of it.  So we concluded to\r\nwalk, for the present, till we had had some wing practice.\r\n\r\nWe begun to meet swarms of folks who were coming back.  Some had harps\r\nand nothing else; some had hymn-books and nothing else; some had nothing\r\nat all; all of them looked meek and uncomfortable; one young fellow\r\nhadn’t anything left but his halo, and he was carrying that in his hand;\r\nall of a sudden he offered it to me and says—\r\n\r\n“Will you hold it for me a minute?”\r\n\r\nThen he disappeared in the crowd.  I went on.  A woman asked me to hold\r\nher palm branch, and then _she_ disappeared.  A girl got me to hold her\r\nharp for her, and by George, _she_ disappeared; and so on and so on, till\r\nI was about loaded down to the guards.  Then comes a smiling old\r\ngentleman and asked me to hold _his_ things.  I swabbed off the\r\nperspiration and says, pretty tart—\r\n\r\n“I’ll have to get you to excuse me, my friend,—_I_ ain’t no hat-rack.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time I begun to run across piles of those traps, lying in the\r\nroad.  I just quietly dumped my extra cargo along with them.  I looked\r\naround, and, Peters, that whole nation that was following me were loaded\r\ndown the same as I’d been.  The return crowd had got them to hold their\r\nthings a minute, you see.  They all dumped their loads, too, and we went\r\non.\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself perched on a cloud, with a million other people, I\r\nnever felt so good in my life.  Says I, “Now this is according to the\r\npromises; I’ve been having my doubts, but now I am in heaven, sure\r\nenough.”  I gave my palm branch a wave or two, for luck, and then I\r\ntautened up my harp-strings and struck in.  Well, Peters, you can’t\r\nimagine anything like the row we made.  It was grand to listen to, and\r\nmade a body thrill all over, but there was considerable many tunes going\r\non at once, and that was a drawback to the harmony, you understand; and\r\nthen there was a lot of Injun tribes, and they kept up such another\r\nwar-whooping that they kind of took the tuck out of the music.  By and by\r\nI quit performing, and judged I’d take a rest.  There was quite a nice\r\nmild old gentleman sitting next me, and I noticed he didn’t take a hand;\r\nI encouraged him, but he said he was naturally bashful, and was afraid to\r\ntry before so many people.  By and by the old gentleman said he never\r\ncould seem to enjoy music somehow.  The fact was, I was beginning to feel\r\nthe same way; but I didn’t say anything.  Him and I had a considerable\r\nlong silence, then, but of course it warn’t noticeable in that place.\r\nAfter about sixteen or seventeen hours, during which I played and sung a\r\nlittle, now and then—always the same tune, because I didn’t know any\r\nother—I laid down my harp and begun to fan myself with my palm branch.\r\nThen we both got to sighing pretty regular.  Finally, says he—\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know any tune but the one you’ve been pegging at all day?”\r\n\r\n“Not another blessed one,” says I.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you reckon you could learn another one?” says he.\r\n\r\n“Never,” says I; “I’ve tried to, but I couldn’t manage it.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a long time to hang to the one—eternity, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t break my heart,” says I; “I’m getting low-spirited enough\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\nAfter another long silence, says he—\r\n\r\n“Are you glad to be here?”\r\n\r\nSays I, “Old man, I’ll be frank with you.  This _ain’t_ just as near my\r\nidea of bliss as I thought it was going to be, when I used to go to\r\nchurch.”\r\n\r\nSays he, “What do you say to knocking off and calling it half a day?”\r\n\r\n“That’s me,” says I.  “I never wanted to get off watch so bad in my\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nSo we started.  Millions were coming to the cloud-bank all the time,\r\nhappy and hosannahing; millions were leaving it all the time, looking\r\nmighty quiet, I tell you.  We laid for the new-comers, and pretty soon\r\nI’d got them to hold all my things a minute, and then I was a free man\r\nagain and most outrageously happy.  Just then I ran across old Sam\r\nBartlett, who had been dead a long time, and stopped to have a talk with\r\nhim.  Says I—\r\n\r\n“Now tell me—is this to go on forever?  Ain’t there anything else for a\r\nchange?”\r\n\r\nSays he—\r\n\r\n“I’ll set you right on that point very quick.  People take the figurative\r\nlanguage of the Bible and the allegories for literal, and the first thing\r\nthey ask for when they get here is a halo and a harp, and so on.  Nothing\r\nthat’s harmless and reasonable is refused a body here, if he asks it in\r\nthe right spirit.  So they are outfitted with these things without a\r\nword.  They go and sing and play just about one day, and that’s the last\r\nyou’ll ever see them in the choir.  They don’t need anybody to tell them\r\nthat that sort of thing wouldn’t make a heaven—at least not a heaven that\r\na sane man could stand a week and remain sane.  That cloud-bank is placed\r\nwhere the noise can’t disturb the old inhabitants, and so there ain’t any\r\nharm in letting everybody get up there and cure himself as soon as he\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\n“Now you just remember this—heaven is as blissful and lovely as it can\r\nbe; but it’s just the busiest place you ever heard of.  There ain’t any\r\nidle people here after the first day.  Singing hymns and waving palm\r\nbranches through all eternity is pretty when you hear about it in the\r\npulpit, but it’s as poor a way to put in valuable time as a body could\r\ncontrive.  It would just make a heaven of warbling ignoramuses, don’t you\r\nsee?  Eternal Rest sounds comforting in the pulpit, too.  Well, you try\r\nit once, and see how heavy time will hang on your hands.  Why,\r\nStormfield, a man like you, that had been active and stirring all his\r\nlife, would go mad in six months in a heaven where he hadn’t anything to\r\ndo.  Heaven is the very last place to come to _rest_ in,—and don’t you be\r\nafraid to bet on that!”\r\n\r\nSays I—\r\n\r\n“Sam, I’m as glad to hear it as I thought I’d be sorry.  I’m glad I come,\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nSays he—\r\n\r\n“Cap’n, ain’t you pretty physically tired?”\r\n\r\nSays I—\r\n\r\n“Sam, it ain’t any name for it!  I’m dog-tired.”\r\n\r\n“Just so—just so.  You’ve earned a good sleep, and you’ll get it.  You’ve\r\nearned a good appetite, and you’ll enjoy your dinner.  It’s the same here\r\nas it is on earth—you’ve got to earn a thing, square and honest, before\r\nyou enjoy it.  You can’t enjoy first and earn afterwards.  But there’s\r\nthis difference, here: you can choose your own occupation, and all the\r\npowers of heaven will be put forth to help you make a success of it, if\r\nyou do your level best.  The shoemaker on earth that had the soul of a\r\npoet in him won’t have to make shoes here.”\r\n\r\n“Now that’s all reasonable and right,” says I.  “Plenty of work, and the\r\nkind you hanker after; no more pain, no more suffering—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, hold on; there’s plenty of pain here—but it don’t kill.  There’s\r\nplenty of suffering here, but it don’t last.  You see, happiness ain’t a\r\n_thing in itself_—it’s only a _contrast_ with something that ain’t\r\npleasant.  That’s all it is.  There ain’t a thing you can mention that is\r\nhappiness in its own self—it’s only so by contrast with the other thing.\r\nAnd so, as soon as the novelty is over and the force of the contrast\r\ndulled, it ain’t happiness any longer, and you have to get something\r\nfresh.  Well, there’s plenty of pain and suffering in heaven—consequently\r\nthere’s plenty of contrasts, and just no end of happiness.”\r\n\r\nSays I, “It’s the sensiblest heaven I’ve heard of yet, Sam, though it’s\r\nabout as different from the one I was brought up on as a live princess is\r\ndifferent from her own wax figger.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAlong in the first months I knocked around about the Kingdom, making\r\nfriends and looking at the country, and finally settled down in a pretty\r\nlikely region, to have a rest before taking another start.  I went on\r\nmaking acquaintances and gathering up information.  I had a good deal of\r\ntalk with an old bald-headed angel by the name of Sandy McWilliams.  He\r\nwas from somewhere in New Jersey.  I went about with him, considerable.\r\nWe used to lay around, warm afternoons, in the shade of a rock, on some\r\nmeadow-ground that was pretty high and out of the marshy slush of his\r\ncranberry-farm, and there we used to talk about all kinds of things, and\r\nsmoke pipes.  One day, says I—\r\n\r\n“About how old might you be, Sandy?”\r\n\r\n“Seventy-two.”\r\n\r\n“I judged so.  How long you been in heaven?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-seven years, come Christmas.”\r\n\r\n“How old was you when you come up?”\r\n\r\n“Why, seventy-two, of course.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t mean it!”\r\n\r\n“Why can’t I mean it?”\r\n\r\n“Because, if you was seventy-two then, you are naturally ninety-nine\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“No, but I ain’t.  I stay the same age I was when I come.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “come to think, there’s something just here that I want\r\nto ask about.  Down below, I always had an idea that in heaven we would\r\nall be young, and bright, and spry.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can be young if you want to.  You’ve only got to wish.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, why didn’t you wish?”\r\n\r\n“I did.  They all do.  You’ll try it, some day, like enough; but you’ll\r\nget tired of the change pretty soon.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll tell you.  Now you’ve always been a sailor; did you ever try\r\nsome other business?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I tried keeping grocery, once, up in the mines; but I couldn’t\r\nstand it; it was too dull—no stir, no storm, no life about it; it was\r\nlike being part dead and part alive, both at the same time.  I wanted to\r\nbe one thing or t’other.  I shut up shop pretty quick and went to sea.”\r\n\r\n“That’s it.  Grocery people like it, but you couldn’t.  You see you\r\nwasn’t used to it.  Well, I wasn’t used to being young, and I couldn’t\r\nseem to take any interest in it.  I was strong, and handsome, and had\r\ncurly hair,—yes, and wings, too!—gay wings like a butterfly.  I went to\r\npicnics and dances and parties with the fellows, and tried to carry on\r\nand talk nonsense with the girls, but it wasn’t any use; I couldn’t take\r\nto it—fact is, it was an awful bore.  What I wanted was early to bed and\r\nearly to rise, and something to _do_; and when my work was done, I wanted\r\nto sit quiet, and smoke and think—not tear around with a parcel of giddy\r\nyoung kids.  You can’t think what I suffered whilst I was young.”\r\n\r\n“How long was you young?”\r\n\r\n“Only two weeks.  That was plenty for me.  Laws, I was so lonesome!  You\r\nsee, I was full of the knowledge and experience of seventy-two years; the\r\ndeepest subject those young folks could strike was only _a-b-c_ to me.\r\nAnd to hear them argue—oh, my! it would have been funny, if it hadn’t\r\nbeen so pitiful.  Well, I was so hungry for the ways and the sober talk I\r\nwas used to, that I tried to ring in with the old people, but they\r\nwouldn’t have it.  They considered me a conceited young upstart, and gave\r\nme the cold shoulder.  Two weeks was a-plenty for me.  I was glad to get\r\nback my bald head again, and my pipe, and my old drowsy reflections in\r\nthe shade of a rock or a tree.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “do you mean to say you’re going to stand still at\r\nseventy-two, forever?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, and I ain’t particular.  But I ain’t going to drop back to\r\ntwenty-five any more—I know that, mighty well.  I know a sight more than\r\nI did twenty-seven years ago, and I enjoy learning, all the time, but I\r\ndon’t seem to get any older.  That is, bodily—my mind gets older, and\r\nstronger, and better seasoned, and more satisfactory.”\r\n\r\nSays I, “If a man comes here at ninety, don’t he ever set himself back?”\r\n\r\n“Of course he does.  He sets himself back to fourteen; tries it a couple\r\nof hours, and feels like a fool; sets himself forward to twenty; it ain’t\r\nmuch improvement; tries thirty, fifty, eighty, and finally ninety—finds\r\nhe is more at home and comfortable at the same old figure he is used to\r\nthan any other way.  Or, if his mind begun to fail him on earth at\r\neighty, that’s where he finally sticks up here.  He sticks at the place\r\nwhere his mind was last at its best, for there’s where his enjoyment is\r\nbest, and his ways most set and established.”\r\n\r\n“Does a chap of twenty-five stay always twenty-five, and look it?”\r\n\r\n“If he is a fool, yes.  But if he is bright, and ambitious and\r\nindustrious, the knowledge he gains and the experiences he has, change\r\nhis ways and thoughts and likings, and make him find his best pleasure in\r\nthe company of people above that age; so he allows his body to take on\r\nthat look of as many added years as he needs to make him comfortable and\r\nproper in that sort of society; he lets his body go on taking the look of\r\nage, according as he progresses, and by and by he will be bald and\r\nwrinkled outside, and wise and deep within.”\r\n\r\n“Babies the same?”\r\n\r\n“Babies the same.  Laws, what asses we used to be, on earth, about these\r\nthings!  We said we’d be always young in heaven.  We didn’t say _how_\r\nyoung—we didn’t think of that, perhaps—that is, we didn’t all think\r\nalike, anyway.  When I was a boy of seven, I suppose I thought we’d all\r\nbe twelve, in heaven; when I was twelve, I suppose I thought we’d all be\r\neighteen or twenty in heaven; when I was forty, I begun to go back; I\r\nremember I hoped we’d all be about _thirty_ years old in heaven.  Neither\r\na man nor a boy ever thinks the age he _has_ is exactly the best one—he\r\nputs the right age a few years older or a few years younger than he is.\r\nThen he makes that ideal age the general age of the heavenly people.  And\r\nhe expects everybody _to stick_ at that age—stand stock-still—and expects\r\nthem to enjoy it!—Now just think of the idea of standing still in heaven!\r\nThink of a heaven made up entirely of hoop-rolling, marble-playing cubs\r\nof seven years!—or of awkward, diffident, sentimental immaturities of\r\nnineteen!—or of vigorous people of thirty, healthy-minded, brimming with\r\nambition, but chained hand and foot to that one age and its limitations\r\nlike so many helpless galley-slaves!  Think of the dull sameness of a\r\nsociety made up of people all of one age and one set of looks, habits,\r\ntastes and feelings.  Think how superior to it earth would be, with its\r\nvariety of types and faces and ages, and the enlivening attrition of the\r\nmyriad interests that come into pleasant collision in such a variegated\r\nsociety.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” says I, “do you know what you’re doing?”\r\n\r\n“Well, what am I doing?”\r\n\r\n“You are making heaven pretty comfortable in one way, but you are playing\r\nthe mischief with it in another.”\r\n\r\n“How d’you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I says, “take a young mother that’s lost her child, and—”\r\n\r\n“Sh!” he says.  “Look!”\r\n\r\nIt was a woman.  Middle-aged, and had grizzled hair.  She was walking\r\nslow, and her head was bent down, and her wings hanging limp and droopy;\r\nand she looked ever so tired, and was crying, poor thing!  She passed\r\nalong by, with her head down, that way, and the tears running down her\r\nface, and didn’t see us.  Then Sandy said, low and gentle, and full of\r\npity:\r\n\r\n“_She’s_ hunting for her child!  No, _found_ it, I reckon.  Lord, how\r\nshe’s changed!  But I recognized her in a minute, though it’s\r\ntwenty-seven years since I saw her.  A young mother she was, about twenty\r\ntwo or four, or along there; and blooming and lovely and sweet? oh, just\r\na flower!  And all her heart and all her soul was wrapped up in her\r\nchild, her little girl, two years old.  And it died, and she went wild\r\nwith grief, just wild!  Well, the only comfort she had was that she’d see\r\nher child again, in heaven—‘never more to part,’ she said, and kept on\r\nsaying it over and over, ‘never more to part.’  And the words made her\r\nhappy; yes, they did; they made her joyful, and when I was dying,\r\ntwenty-seven years ago, she told me to find her child the first thing,\r\nand say she was coming—‘soon, soon, _very_ soon, she hoped and\r\nbelieved!’”\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s pitiful, Sandy.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t say anything for a while, but sat looking at the ground,\r\nthinking.  Then he says, kind of mournful:\r\n\r\n“And now she’s come!”\r\n\r\n“Well?  Go on.”\r\n\r\n“Stormfield, maybe she hasn’t found the child, but _I_ think she has.\r\nLooks so to me.  I’ve seen cases before.  You see, she’s kept that child\r\nin her head just the same as it was when she jounced it in her arms a\r\nlittle chubby thing.  But here it didn’t elect to _stay_ a child.  No, it\r\nelected to grow up, which it did.  And in these twenty-seven years it has\r\nlearned all the deep scientific learning there is to learn, and is\r\nstudying and studying and learning and learning more and more, all the\r\ntime, and don’t give a damn for anything _but_ learning; just learning,\r\nand discussing gigantic problems with people like herself.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Stormfield, don’t you see?  Her mother knows _cranberries_, and how to\r\ntend them, and pick them, and put them up, and market them; and not\r\nanother blamed thing!  Her and her daughter can’t be any more company for\r\neach other _now_ than mud turtle and bird o’ paradise.  Poor thing, she\r\nwas looking for a baby to jounce; _I_ think she’s struck a\r\ndisapp’intment.”\r\n\r\n“Sandy, what will they do—stay unhappy forever in heaven?”\r\n\r\n“No, they’ll come together and get adjusted by and by.  But not this\r\nyear, and not next.  By and by.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been having considerable trouble with my wings.  The day after I\r\nhelped the choir I made a dash or two with them, but was not lucky.\r\nFirst off, I flew thirty yards, and then fouled an Irishman and brought\r\nhim down—brought us both down, in fact.  Next, I had a collision with a\r\nBishop—and bowled him down, of course.  We had some sharp words, and I\r\nfelt pretty cheap, to come banging into a grave old person like that,\r\nwith a million strangers looking on and smiling to themselves.\r\n\r\nI saw I hadn’t got the hang of the steering, and so couldn’t rightly tell\r\nwhere I was going to bring up when I started.  I went afoot the rest of\r\nthe day, and let my wings hang.  Early next morning I went to a private\r\nplace to have some practice.  I got up on a pretty high rock, and got a\r\ngood start, and went swooping down, aiming for a bush a little over three\r\nhundred yards off; but I couldn’t seem to calculate for the wind, which\r\nwas about two points abaft my beam.  I could see I was going considerable\r\nto looard of the bush, so I worked my starboard wing slow and went ahead\r\nstrong on the port one, but it wouldn’t answer; I could see I was going\r\nto broach to, so I slowed down on both, and lit.  I went back to the rock\r\nand took another chance at it.  I aimed two or three points to starboard\r\nof the bush—yes, more than that—enough so as to make it nearly a\r\nhead-wind.  I done well enough, but made pretty poor time.  I could see,\r\nplain enough, that on a head-wind, wings was a mistake.  I could see that\r\na body could sail pretty close to the wind, but he couldn’t go in the\r\nwind’s eye.  I could see that if I wanted to go a-visiting any distance\r\nfrom home, and the wind was ahead, I might have to wait days, maybe, for\r\na change; and I could see, too, that these things could not be any use at\r\nall in a gale; if you tried to run before the wind, you would make a mess\r\nof it, for there isn’t anyway to shorten sail—like reefing, you know—you\r\nhave to take it _all_ in—shut your feathers down flat to your sides.\r\nThat would _land_ you, of course.  You could lay to, with your head to\r\nthe wind—that is the best you could do, and right hard work you’d find\r\nit, too.  If you tried any other game, you would founder, sure.\r\n\r\nI judge it was about a couple of weeks or so after this that I dropped\r\nold Sandy McWilliams a note one day—it was a Tuesday—and asked him to\r\ncome over and take his manna and quails with me next day; and the first\r\nthing he did when he stepped in was to twinkle his eye in a sly way, and\r\nsay,—\r\n\r\n“Well, Cap, what you done with your wings?”\r\n\r\nI saw in a minute that there was some sarcasm done up in that rag\r\nsomewheres, but I never let on.  I only says,—\r\n\r\n“Gone to the wash.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he says, in a dry sort of way, “they mostly go to the wash—about\r\nthis time—I’ve often noticed it.  Fresh angels are powerful neat.  When\r\ndo you look for ’em back?”\r\n\r\n“Day after to-morrow,” says I.\r\n\r\nHe winked at me, and smiled.\r\n\r\nSays I,—\r\n\r\n“Sandy, out with it.  Come—no secrets among friends.  I notice you don’t\r\never wear wings—and plenty others don’t.  I’ve been making an ass of\r\nmyself—is that it?”\r\n\r\n“That is about the size of it.  But it is no harm.  We all do it at\r\nfirst.  It’s perfectly natural.  You see, on earth we jump to such\r\nfoolish conclusions as to things up here.  In the pictures we always saw\r\nthe angels with wings on—and that was all right; but we jumped to the\r\nconclusion that that was their way of getting around—and that was all\r\nwrong.  The wings ain’t anything but a uniform, that’s all.  When they\r\nare in the field—so to speak,—they always wear them; you never see an\r\nangel going with a message anywhere without his wings, any more than you\r\nwould see a military officer presiding at a court-martial without his\r\nuniform, or a postman delivering letters, or a policeman walking his\r\nbeat, in plain clothes.  But they ain’t to _fly_ with!  The wings are for\r\nshow, not for use.  Old experienced angels are like officers of the\r\nregular army—they dress plain, when they are off duty.  New angels are\r\nlike the militia—never shed the uniform—always fluttering and floundering\r\naround in their wings, butting people down, flapping here, and there, and\r\neverywhere, always imagining they are attracting the admiring eye—well,\r\nthey just think they are the very most important people in heaven.  And\r\nwhen you see one of them come sailing around with one wing tipped up and\r\nt’other down, you make up your mind he is saying to himself: ‘I wish Mary\r\nAnn in Arkansaw could see me now.  I reckon she’d wish she hadn’t shook\r\nme.’  No, they’re just for show, that’s all—only just for show.”\r\n\r\n“I judge you’ve got it about right, Sandy,” says I.\r\n\r\n“Why, look at it yourself,” says he.  “_You_ ain’t built for wings—no man\r\nis.  You know what a grist of years it took you to come here from the\r\nearth—and yet you were booming along faster than any cannon-ball could\r\ngo.  Suppose you had to fly that distance with your wings—wouldn’t\r\neternity have been over before you got here?  Certainly.  Well, angels\r\nhave to go to the earth every day—millions of them—to appear in visions\r\nto dying children and good people, you know—it’s the heft of their\r\nbusiness.  They appear with their wings, of course, because they are on\r\nofficial service, and because the dying persons wouldn’t know they were\r\nangels if they hadn’t wings—but do you reckon they fly with them?  It\r\nstands to reason they don’t.  The wings would wear out before they got\r\nhalf-way; even the pin-feathers would be gone; the wing frames would be\r\nas bare as kite sticks before the paper is pasted on.  The distances in\r\nheaven are billions of times greater; angels have to go all over heaven\r\nevery day; could they do it with their wings alone?  No, indeed; they\r\nwear the wings for style, but they travel any distance in an instant by\r\n_wishing_.  The wishing-carpet of the Arabian Nights was a sensible\r\nidea—but our earthly idea of angels flying these awful distances with\r\ntheir clumsy wings was foolish.\r\n\r\n“Our young saints, of both sexes, wear wings all the time—blazing red\r\nones, and blue and green, and gold, and variegated, and rainbowed, and\r\nring-streaked-and-striped ones—and nobody finds fault.  It is suitable to\r\ntheir time of life.  The things are beautiful, and they set the young\r\npeople off.  They are the most striking and lovely part of their outfit—a\r\nhalo don’t _begin_.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “I’ve tucked mine away in the cupboard, and I allow to\r\nlet them lay there till there’s mud.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—or a reception.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can see one to-night if you want to.  There’s a barkeeper from\r\nJersey City going to be received.”\r\n\r\n“Go on—tell me about it.”\r\n\r\n“This barkeeper got converted at a Moody and Sankey meeting, in New York,\r\nand started home on the ferry-boat, and there was a collision and he got\r\ndrowned.  He is of a class that think all heaven goes wild with joy when\r\na particularly hard lot like him is saved; they think all heaven turns\r\nout hosannahing to welcome them; they think there isn’t anything talked\r\nabout in the realms of the blest but their case, for that day.  This\r\nbarkeeper thinks there hasn’t been such another stir here in years, as\r\nhis coming is going to raise.—And I’ve always noticed this peculiarity\r\nabout a dead barkeeper—he not only expects all hands to turn out when he\r\narrives, but he expects to be received with a torchlight procession.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon he is disappointed, then.”\r\n\r\n“No, he isn’t.  No man is allowed to be disappointed here.  Whatever he\r\nwants, when he comes—that is, any reasonable and unsacrilegious thing—he\r\ncan have.  There’s always a few millions or billions of young folks\r\naround who don’t want any better entertainment than to fill up their\r\nlungs and swarm out with their torches and have a high time over a\r\nbarkeeper.  It tickles the barkeeper till he can’t rest, it makes a\r\ncharming lark for the young folks, it don’t do anybody any harm, it don’t\r\ncost a rap, and it keeps up the place’s reputation for making all comers\r\nhappy and content.”\r\n\r\n“Very good.  I’ll be on hand and see them land the barkeeper.”\r\n\r\n“It is manners to go in full dress.  You want to wear your wings, you\r\nknow, and your other things.”\r\n\r\n“Which ones?”\r\n\r\n“Halo, and harp, and palm branch, and all that.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “I reckon I ought to be ashamed of myself, but the fact\r\nis I left them laying around that day I resigned from the choir.  I\r\nhaven’t got a rag to wear but this robe and the wings.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right.  You’ll find they’ve been raked up and saved for you.\r\nSend for them.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do it, Sandy.  But what was it you was saying about unsacrilegious\r\nthings, which people expect to get, and will be disappointed about?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there are a lot of such things that people expect and don’t get.\r\nFor instance, there’s a Brooklyn preacher by the name of Talmage, who is\r\nlaying up a considerable disappointment for himself.  He says, every now\r\nand then in his sermons, that the first thing he does when he gets to\r\nheaven, will be to fling his arms around Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and\r\nkiss them and weep on them.  There’s millions of people down there on\r\nearth that are promising themselves the same thing.  As many as sixty\r\nthousand people arrive here every single day, that want to run straight\r\nto Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and hug them and weep on them.  Now mind\r\nyou, sixty thousand a day is a pretty heavy contract for those old\r\npeople.  If they were a mind to allow it, they wouldn’t ever have\r\nanything to do, year in and year out, but stand up and be hugged and wept\r\non thirty-two hours in the twenty-four.  They would be tired out and as\r\nwet as muskrats all the time.  What would heaven be, to _them_?  It would\r\nbe a mighty good place to get out of—you know that, yourself.  Those are\r\nkind and gentle old Jews, but they ain’t any fonder of kissing the\r\nemotional highlights of Brooklyn than you be.  You mark my words, Mr.\r\nT.’s endearments are going to be declined, with thanks.  There are limits\r\nto the privileges of the elect, even in heaven.  Why, if Adam was to show\r\nhimself to every new comer that wants to call and gaze at him and strike\r\nhim for his autograph, he would never have time to do anything else but\r\njust that.  Talmage has said he is going to give Adam some of his\r\nattentions, as well as A., I. and J.  But he will have to change his mind\r\nabout that.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think Talmage will really come here?”\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly, he will; but don’t you be alarmed; he will run with his\r\nown kind, and there’s plenty of them.  That is the main charm of\r\nheaven—there’s all kinds here—which wouldn’t be the case if you let the\r\npreachers tell it.  Anybody can find the sort he prefers, here, and he\r\njust lets the others alone, and they let him alone.  When the Deity\r\nbuilds a heaven, it is built right, and on a liberal plan.”\r\n\r\nSandy sent home for his things, and I sent for mine, and about nine in\r\nthe evening we begun to dress.  Sandy says,—\r\n\r\n“This is going to be a grand time for you, Stormy.  Like as not some of\r\nthe patriarchs will turn out.”\r\n\r\n“No, but will they?”\r\n\r\n“Like as not.  Of course they are pretty exclusive.  They hardly ever\r\nshow themselves to the common public.  I believe they never turn out\r\nexcept for an eleventh-hour convert.  They wouldn’t do it then, only\r\nearthly tradition makes a grand show pretty necessary on that kind of an\r\noccasion.”\r\n\r\n“Do they an turn out, Sandy?”\r\n\r\n“Who?—all the patriarchs?  Oh, no—hardly ever more than a couple.  You\r\nwill be here fifty thousand years—maybe more—before you get a glimpse of\r\nall the patriarchs and prophets.  Since I have been here, Job has been to\r\nthe front once, and once Ham and Jeremiah both at the same time.  But the\r\nfinest thing that has happened in my day was a year or so ago; that was\r\nCharles Peace’s reception—him they called ‘the Bannercross Murderer’—an\r\nEnglishman.  There were four patriarchs and two prophets on the Grand\r\nStand that time—there hasn’t been anything like it since Captain Kidd\r\ncame; Abel was there—the first time in twelve hundred years.  A report\r\ngot around that Adam was coming; well, of course, Abel was enough to\r\nbring a crowd, all by himself, but there is nobody that can draw like\r\nAdam.  It was a false report, but it got around, anyway, as I say, and it\r\nwill be a long day before I see the like of it again.  The reception was\r\nin the English department, of course, which is eight hundred and eleven\r\nmillion miles from the New Jersey line.  I went, along with a good many\r\nof my neighbors, and it was a sight to see, I can tell you.  Flocks came\r\nfrom all the departments.  I saw Esquimaux there, and Tartars, Negroes,\r\nChinamen—people from everywhere.  You see a mixture like that in the\r\nGrand Choir, the first day you land here, but you hardly ever see it\r\nagain.  There were billions of people; when they were singing or\r\nhosannahing, the noise was wonderful; and even when their tongues were\r\nstill the drumming of the wings was nearly enough to burst your head, for\r\nall the sky was as thick as if it was snowing angels.  Although Adam was\r\nnot there, it was a great time anyway, because we had three archangels on\r\nthe Grand Stand—it is a seldom thing that even one comes out.”\r\n\r\n“What did they look like, Sandy?”\r\n\r\n“Well, they had shining faces, and shining robes, and wonderful rainbow\r\nwings, and they stood eighteen feet high, and wore swords, and held their\r\nheads up in a noble way, and looked like soldiers.”\r\n\r\n“Did they have halos?”\r\n\r\n“No—anyway, not the hoop kind.  The archangels and the upper-class\r\npatriarchs wear a finer thing than that.  It is a round, solid, splendid\r\nglory of gold, that is blinding to look at.  You have often seen a\r\npatriarch in a picture, on earth, with that thing on—you remember it?—he\r\nlooks as if he had his head in a brass platter.  That don’t give you the\r\nright idea of it at all—it is much more shining and beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“Did you talk with those archangels and patriarchs, Sandy?”\r\n\r\n“Who—_I_?  Why, what can you be thinking about, Stormy?  I ain’t worthy\r\nto speak to such as they.”\r\n\r\n“Is Talmage?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not.  You have got the same mixed-up idea about these things\r\nthat everybody has down there.  I had it once, but I got over it.  Down\r\nthere they talk of the heavenly King—and that is right—but then they go\r\nright on speaking as if this was a republic and everybody was on a dead\r\nlevel with everybody else, and privileged to fling his arms around\r\nanybody he comes across, and be hail-fellow-well-met with all the elect,\r\nfrom the highest down.  How tangled up and absurd that is!  How are you\r\ngoing to have a republic under a king?  How are you going to have a\r\nrepublic at all, where the head of the government is absolute, holds his\r\nplace forever, and has no parliament, no council to meddle or make in his\r\naffairs, nobody voted for, nobody elected, nobody in the whole universe\r\nwith a voice in the government, nobody asked to take a hand in its\r\nmatters, and nobody _allowed_ to do it?  Fine republic, ain’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes—it _is_ a little different from the idea I had—but I thought I\r\nmight go around and get acquainted with the grandees, anyway—not exactly\r\nsplice the main-brace with them, you know, but shake hands and pass the\r\ntime of day.”\r\n\r\n“Could Tom, Dick and Harry call on the Cabinet of Russia and do that?—on\r\nPrince Gortschakoff, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“I reckon not, Sandy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this is Russia—only more so.  There’s not the shadow of a republic\r\nabout it anywhere.  There are ranks, here.  There are viceroys, princes,\r\ngovernors, sub-governors, sub-sub-governors, and a hundred orders of\r\nnobility, grading along down from grand-ducal archangels, stage by stage,\r\ntill the general level is struck, where there ain’t any titles.  Do you\r\nknow what a prince of the blood is, on earth?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, a prince of the blood don’t belong to the royal family exactly,\r\nand he don’t belong to the mere nobility of the kingdom; he is lower than\r\nthe one, and higher than t’other.  That’s about the position of the\r\npatriarchs and prophets here.  There’s some mighty high nobility\r\nhere—people that you and I ain’t worthy to polish sandals for—and _they_\r\nain’t worthy to polish sandals for the patriarchs and prophets.  That\r\ngives you a kind of an idea of their rank, don’t it?  You begin to see\r\nhow high up they are, don’t you? just to get a two-minute glimpse of one\r\nof them is a thing for a body to remember and tell about for a thousand\r\nyears.  Why, Captain, just think of this: if Abraham was to set his foot\r\ndown here by this door, there would be a railing set up around that\r\nfoot-track right away, and a shelter put over it, and people would flock\r\nhere from all over heaven, for hundreds and hundreds of years, to look at\r\nit.  Abraham is one of the parties that Mr. Talmage, of Brooklyn, is\r\ngoing to embrace, and kiss, and weep on, when he comes.  He wants to lay\r\nin a good stock of tears, you know, or five to one he will go dry before\r\nhe gets a chance to do it.”\r\n\r\n“Sandy,” says I, “I had an idea that _I_ was going to be equals with\r\neverybody here, too, but I will let that drop.  It don’t matter, and I am\r\nplenty happy enough anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Captain, you are happier than you would be, the other way.  These old\r\npatriarchs and prophets have got ages the start of you; they know more in\r\ntwo minutes than you know in a year.  Did you ever try to have a sociable\r\nimproving-time discussing winds, and currents and variations of compass\r\nwith an undertaker?”\r\n\r\n“I get your idea, Sandy.  He couldn’t interest me.  He would be an\r\nignoramus in such things—he would bore me, and I would bore him.”\r\n\r\n“You have got it.  You would bore the patriarchs when you talked, and\r\nwhen they talked they would shoot over your head.  By and by you would\r\nsay, ‘Good morning, your Eminence, I will call again’—but you wouldn’t.\r\nDid you ever ask the slush-boy to come up in the cabin and take dinner\r\nwith you?”\r\n\r\n“I get your drift again, Sandy.  I wouldn’t be used to such grand people\r\nas the patriarchs and prophets, and I would be sheepish and tongue-tied\r\nin their company, and mighty glad to get out of it.  Sandy, which is the\r\nhighest rank, patriarch or prophet?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the prophets hold over the patriarchs.  The newest prophet, even, is\r\nof a sight more consequence than the oldest patriarch.  Yes, sir, Adam\r\nhimself has to walk behind Shakespeare.”\r\n\r\n“Was Shakespeare a prophet?”\r\n\r\n“Of course he was; and so was Homer, and heaps more.  But Shakespeare and\r\nthe rest have to walk behind a common tailor from Tennessee, by the name\r\nof Billings; and behind a horse-doctor named Sakka, from Afghanistan.\r\nJeremiah, and Billings and Buddha walk together, side by side, right\r\nbehind a crowd from planets not in our astronomy; next come a dozen or\r\ntwo from Jupiter and other worlds; next come Daniel, and Sakka and\r\nConfucius; next a lot from systems outside of ours; next come Ezekiel,\r\nand Mahomet, Zoroaster, and a knife-grinder from ancient Egypt; then\r\nthere is a long string, and after them, away down toward the bottom, come\r\nShakespeare and Homer, and a shoemaker named Marais, from the back\r\nsettlements of France.”\r\n\r\n“Have they really rung in Mahomet and all those other heathens?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—they all had their message, and they all get their reward.  The man\r\nwho don’t get his reward on earth, needn’t bother—he will get it here,\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\n“But why did they throw off on Shakespeare, that way, and put him away\r\ndown there below those shoe-makers and horse-doctors and knife-grinders—a\r\nlot of people nobody ever heard of?”\r\n\r\n“That is the heavenly justice of it—they warn’t rewarded according to\r\ntheir deserts, on earth, but here they get their rightful rank.  That\r\ntailor Billings, from Tennessee, wrote poetry that Homer and Shakespeare\r\ncouldn’t begin to come up to; but nobody would print it, nobody read it\r\nbut his neighbors, an ignorant lot, and they laughed at it.  Whenever the\r\nvillage had a drunken frolic and a dance, they would drag him in and\r\ncrown him with cabbage leaves, and pretend to bow down to him; and one\r\nnight when he was sick and nearly starved to death, they had him out and\r\ncrowned him, and then they rode him on a rail about the village, and\r\neverybody followed along, beating tin pans and yelling.  Well, he died\r\nbefore morning.  He wasn’t ever expecting to go to heaven, much less that\r\nthere was going to be any fuss made over him, so I reckon he was a good\r\ndeal surprised when the reception broke on him.”\r\n\r\n“Was you there, Sandy?”\r\n\r\n“Bless you, no!”\r\n\r\n“Why?  Didn’t you know it was going to come off?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I judge I did.  It was the talk of these realms—not for a day,\r\nlike this barkeeper business, but for twenty years before the man died.”\r\n\r\n“Why the mischief didn’t you go, then?”\r\n\r\n“Now how you talk!  The like of me go meddling around at the reception of\r\na prophet?  A mudsill like me trying to push in and help receive an awful\r\ngrandee like Edward J. Billings?  Why, I should have been laughed at for\r\na billion miles around.  I shouldn’t ever heard the last of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, who did go, then?”\r\n\r\n“Mighty few people that you and I will ever get a chance to see, Captain.\r\nNot a solitary commoner ever has the luck to see a reception of a\r\nprophet, I can tell you.  All the nobility, and all the patriarchs and\r\nprophets—every last one of them—and all the archangels, and all the\r\nprinces and governors and viceroys, were there,—and _no_ small fry—not a\r\nsingle one.  And mind you, I’m not talking about only the grandees from\r\n_our_ world, but the princes and patriarchs and so on from _all_ the\r\nworlds that shine in our sky, and from billions more that belong in\r\nsystems upon systems away outside of the one our sun is in.  There were\r\nsome prophets and patriarchs there that ours ain’t a circumstance to, for\r\nrank and illustriousness and all that.  Some were from Jupiter and other\r\nworlds in our own system, but the most celebrated were three poets, Saa,\r\nBo and Soof, from great planets in three different and very remote\r\nsystems.  These three names are common and familiar in every nook and\r\ncorner of heaven, clear from one end of it to the other—fully as well\r\nknown as the eighty Supreme Archangels, in fact—where as our Moses, and\r\nAdam, and the rest, have not been heard of outside of our world’s little\r\ncorner of heaven, except by a few very learned men scattered here and\r\nthere—and they always spell their names wrong, and get the performances\r\nof one mixed up with the doings of another, and they almost always locate\r\nthem simply _in our solar system_, and think that is enough without going\r\ninto little details such as naming the particular world they are from.\r\nIt is like a learned Hindoo showing off how much he knows by saying\r\nLongfellow lives in the United States—as if he lived all over the United\r\nStates, and as if the country was so small you couldn’t throw a brick\r\nthere without hitting him.  Between you and me, it does gravel me, the\r\ncool way people from those monster worlds outside our system snub our\r\nlittle world, and even our system.  Of course we think a good deal of\r\nJupiter, because our world is only a potato to it, for size; but then\r\nthere are worlds in other systems that Jupiter isn’t even a mustard-seed\r\nto—like the planet Goobra, for instance, which you couldn’t squeeze\r\ninside the orbit of Halley’s comet without straining the rivets.\r\nTourists from Goobra (I mean parties that lived and died there—natives)\r\ncome here, now and then, and inquire about our world, and when they find\r\nout it is so little that a streak of lightning can flash clear around it\r\nin the eighth of a second, they have to lean up against something to\r\nlaugh.  Then they screw a glass into their eye and go to examining us, as\r\nif we were a curious kind of foreign bug, or something of that sort.  One\r\nof them asked me how long our day was; and when I told him it was twelve\r\nhours long, as a general thing, he asked me if people where I was from\r\nconsidered it worth while to get up and wash for such a day as that.\r\nThat is the way with those Goobra people—they can’t seem to let a chance\r\ngo by to throw it in your face that their day is three hundred and\r\ntwenty-two of our years long.  This young snob was just of age—he was six\r\nor seven thousand of his days old—say two million of our years—and he had\r\nall the puppy airs that belong to that time of life—that turning-point\r\nwhen a person has got over being a boy and yet ain’t quite a man exactly.\r\nIf it had been anywhere else but in heaven, I would have given him a\r\npiece of my mind.  Well, anyway, Billings had the grandest reception that\r\nhas been seen in thousands of centuries, and I think it will have a good\r\neffect.  His name will be carried pretty far, and it will make our system\r\ntalked about, and maybe our world, too, and raise us in the respect of\r\nthe general public of heaven.  Why, look here—Shakespeare walked\r\nbackwards before that tailor from Tennessee, and scattered flowers for\r\nhim to walk on, and Homer stood behind his chair and waited on him at the\r\nbanquet.  Of course that didn’t go for much _there_, amongst all those\r\nbig foreigners from other systems, as they hadn’t heard of Shakespeare or\r\nHomer either, but it would amount to considerable down there on our\r\nlittle earth if they could know about it.  I wish there was something in\r\nthat miserable spiritualism, so we could send them word.  That Tennessee\r\nvillage would set up a monument to Billings, then, and his autograph\r\nwould outsell Satan’s.  Well, they had grand times at that reception—a\r\nsmall-fry noble from Hoboken told me all about it—Sir Richard Duffer,\r\nBaronet.”\r\n\r\n“What, Sandy, a nobleman from Hoboken?  How is that?”\r\n\r\n“Easy enough.  Duffer kept a sausage-shop and never saved a cent in his\r\nlife because he used to give all his spare meat to the poor, in a quiet\r\nway.  Not tramps,—no, the other sort—the sort that will starve before\r\nthey will beg—honest square people out of work.  Dick used to watch\r\nhungry-looking men and women and children, and track them home, and find\r\nout all about them from the neighbors, and then feed them and find them\r\nwork.  As nobody ever saw him give anything to anybody, he had the\r\nreputation of being mean; he died with it, too, and everybody said it was\r\na good riddance; but the minute he landed here, they made him a baronet,\r\nand the very first words Dick the sausage-maker of Hoboken heard when he\r\nstepped upon the heavenly shore were, ‘Welcome, Sir Richard Duffer!’  It\r\nsurprised him some, because he thought he had reasons to believe he was\r\npointed for a warmer climate than this one.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden the whole region fairly rocked under the crash of eleven\r\nhundred and one thunder blasts, all let off at once, and Sandy says,—\r\n\r\n“There, that’s for the barkeep.”\r\n\r\nI jumped up and says,—\r\n\r\n“Then let’s be moving along, Sandy; we don’t want to miss any of this\r\nthing, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Keep your seat,” he says; “he is only just telegraphed, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“That blast only means that he has been sighted from the signal-station.\r\nHe is off Sandy Hook.  The committees will go down to meet him, now, and\r\nescort him in.  There will be ceremonies and delays; they won’t he coming\r\nup the Bay for a considerable time, yet.  It is several billion miles\r\naway, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ could have been a barkeeper and a hard lot just as well as not,”\r\nsays I, remembering the lonesome way I arrived, and how there wasn’t any\r\ncommittee nor anything.\r\n\r\n“I notice some regret in your voice,” says Sandy, “and it is natural\r\nenough; but let bygones be bygones; you went according to your lights,\r\nand it is too late now to mend the thing.”\r\n\r\n“No, let it slide, Sandy, I don’t mind.  But you’ve got a Sandy Hook\r\n_here_, too, have you?”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got everything here, just as it is below.  All the States and\r\nTerritories of the Union, and all the kingdoms of the earth and the\r\nislands of the sea are laid out here just as they are on the globe—all\r\nthe same shape they are down there, and all graded to the relative size,\r\nonly each State and realm and island is a good many billion times bigger\r\nhere than it is below.  There goes another blast.”\r\n\r\n“What is that one for?”\r\n\r\n“That is only another fort answering the first one.  They each fire\r\neleven hundred and one thunder blasts at a single dash—it is the usual\r\nsalute for an eleventh-hour guest; a hundred for each hour and an extra\r\none for the guest’s sex; if it was a woman we would know it by their\r\nleaving off the extra gun.”\r\n\r\n“How do we know there’s eleven hundred and one, Sandy, when they all go\r\noff at once?—and yet we certainly do know.”\r\n\r\n“Our intellects are a good deal sharpened up, here, in some ways, and\r\nthat is one of them.  Numbers and sizes and distances are so great, here,\r\nthat we have to be made so we can _feel_ them—our old ways of counting\r\nand measuring and ciphering wouldn’t ever give us an idea of them, but\r\nwould only confuse us and oppress us and make our heads ache.”\r\n\r\nAfter some more talk about this, I says: “Sandy, I notice that I hardly\r\never see a white angel; where I run across one white angel, I strike as\r\nmany as a hundred million copper-colored ones—people that can’t speak\r\nEnglish.  How is that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you will find it the same in any State or Territory of the\r\nAmerican corner of heaven you choose to go to.  I have shot along, a\r\nwhole week on a stretch, and gone millions and millions of miles, through\r\nperfect swarms of angels, without ever seeing a single white one, or\r\nhearing a word I could understand.  You see, America was occupied a\r\nbillion years and more, by Injuns and Aztecs, and that sort of folks,\r\nbefore a white man ever set his foot in it.  During the first three\r\nhundred years after Columbus’s discovery, there wasn’t ever more than one\r\ngood lecture audience of white people, all put together, in America—I\r\nmean the whole thing, British Possessions and all; in the beginning of\r\nour century there were only 6,000,000 or 7,000,000—say seven; 12,000,000\r\nor 14,000,000 in 1825; say 23,000,000 in 1850; 40,000,000 in 1875.  Our\r\ndeath-rate has always been 20 in 1000 per annum.  Well, 140,000 died the\r\nfirst year of the century; 280,000 the twenty-fifth year; 500,000 the\r\nfiftieth year; about a million the seventy-fifth year.  Now I am going to\r\nbe liberal about this thing, and consider that fifty million whites have\r\ndied in America from the beginning up to to-day—make it sixty, if you\r\nwant to; make it a hundred million—it’s no difference about a few\r\nmillions one way or t’other.  Well, now, you can see, yourself, that when\r\nyou come to spread a little dab of people like that over these hundreds\r\nof billions of miles of American territory here in heaven, it is like\r\nscattering a ten-cent box of homoeopathic pills over the Great Sahara and\r\nexpecting to find them again.  You can’t expect us to amount to anything\r\nin heaven, and we _don’t_—now that is the simple fact, and we have got to\r\ndo the best we can with it.  The learned men from other planets and other\r\nsystems come here and hang around a while, when they are touring around\r\nthe Kingdom, and then go back to their own section of heaven and write a\r\nbook of travels, and they give America about five lines in it.  And what\r\ndo they say about us?  They say this wilderness is populated with a\r\nscattering few hundred thousand billions of red angels, with now and then\r\na curiously complected _diseased_ one.  You see, they think we whites and\r\nthe occasional nigger are Injuns that have been bleached out or blackened\r\nby some leprous disease or other—for some peculiarly rascally _sin_, mind\r\nyou.  It is a mighty sour pill for us all, my friend—even the modestest\r\nof us, let alone the other kind, that think they are going to be received\r\nlike a long-lost government bond, and hug Abraham into the bargain.  I\r\nhaven’t asked you any of the particulars, Captain, but I judge it goes\r\nwithout saying—if my experience is worth anything—that there wasn’t much\r\nof a hooraw made over you when you arrived—now was there?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it, Sandy,” says I, coloring up a little; “I wouldn’t have\r\nhad the family see it for any amount you are a mind to name.  Change the\r\nsubject, Sandy, change the subject.”\r\n\r\n“Well, do you think of settling in the California department of bliss?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.  I wasn’t calculating on doing anything really definite in\r\nthat direction till the family come.  I thought I would just look around,\r\nmeantime, in a quiet way, and make up my mind.  Besides, I know a good\r\nmany dead people, and I was calculating to hunt them up and swap a little\r\ngossip with them about friends, and old times, and one thing or another,\r\nand ask them how they like it here, as far as they have got.  I reckon my\r\nwife will want to camp in the California range, though, because most all\r\nher departed will be there, and she likes to be with folks she knows.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you let her.  You see what the Jersey district of heaven is, for\r\nwhites; well, the Californian district is a thousand times worse.  It\r\nswarms with a mean kind of leather-headed mud-colored angels—and your\r\nnearest white neighbor is likely to be a million miles away.  _What a man\r\nmostly misses_, _in heaven_, _is company_—company of his own sort and\r\ncolor and language.  I have come near settling in the European part of\r\nheaven once or twice on that account.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why didn’t you, Sandy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, various reasons.  For one thing, although you _see_ plenty of whites\r\nthere, you can’t understand any of them, hardly, and so you go about as\r\nhungry for talk as you do here.  I like to look at a Russian or a German\r\nor an Italian—I even like to look at a Frenchman if I ever have the luck\r\nto catch him engaged in anything that ain’t indelicate—but _looking_\r\ndon’t cure the hunger—what you want is talk.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s England, Sandy—the English district of heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but it is not so very much better than this end of the heavenly\r\ndomain.  As long as you run across Englishmen born this side of three\r\nhundred years ago, you are all right; but the minute you get back of\r\nElizabeth’s time the language begins to fog up, and the further back you\r\ngo the foggier it gets.  I had some talk with one Langland and a man by\r\nthe name of Chaucer—old-time poets—but it was no use, I couldn’t quite\r\nunderstand them, and they couldn’t quite understand me.  I have had\r\nletters from them since, but it is such broken English I can’t make it\r\nout.  Back of those men’s time the English are just simply foreigners,\r\nnothing more, nothing less; they talk Danish, German, Norman French, and\r\nsometimes a mixture of all three; back of _them_, they talk Latin, and\r\nancient British, Irish, and Gaelic; and then back of these come billions\r\nand billions of pure savages that talk a gibberish that Satan himself\r\ncouldn’t understand.  The fact is, where you strike one man in the\r\nEnglish settlements that you can understand, you wade through awful\r\nswarms that talk something you can’t make head nor tail of.  You see,\r\nevery country on earth has been overlaid so often, in the course of a\r\nbillion years, with different kinds of people and different sorts of\r\nlanguages, that this sort of mongrel business was bound to be the result\r\nin heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Sandy,” says I, “did you see a good many of the great people history\r\ntells about?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—plenty.  I saw kings and all sorts of distinguished people.”\r\n\r\n“Do the kings rank just as they did below?”\r\n\r\n“No; a body can’t bring his rank up here with him.  Divine right is a\r\ngood-enough earthly romance, but it don’t go, here.  Kings drop down to\r\nthe general level as soon as they reach the realms of grace.  I knew\r\nCharles the Second very well—one of the most popular comedians in the\r\nEnglish section—draws first rate.  There are better, of course—people\r\nthat were never heard of on earth—but Charles is making a very good\r\nreputation indeed, and is considered a rising man.  Richard the\r\nLion-hearted is in the prize-ring, and coming into considerable favor.\r\nHenry the Eighth is a tragedian, and the scenes where he kills people are\r\ndone to the very life.  Henry the Sixth keeps a religious-book stand.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever see Napoleon, Sandy?”\r\n\r\n“Often—sometimes in the Corsican range, sometimes in the French.  He\r\nalways hunts up a conspicuous place, and goes frowning around with his\r\narms folded and his field-glass under his arm, looking as grand, gloomy\r\nand peculiar as his reputation calls for, and very much bothered because\r\nhe don’t stand as high, here, for a soldier, as he expected to.”\r\n\r\n“Why, who stands higher?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a _lot_ of people _we_ never heard of before—the shoemaker and\r\nhorse-doctor and knife-grinder kind, you know—clodhoppers from goodness\r\nknows where that never handled a sword or fired a shot in their lives—but\r\nthe soldiership was in them, though they never had a chance to show it.\r\nBut here they take their right place, and Cæsar and Napoleon and\r\nAlexander have to take a back seat.  The greatest military genius our\r\nworld ever produced was a brick-layer from somewhere back of Boston—died\r\nduring the Revolution—by the name of Absalom Jones.  Wherever he goes,\r\ncrowds flock to see him.  You see, everybody knows that if he had had a\r\nchance he would have shown the world some generalship that would have\r\nmade all generalship before look like child’s play and ’prentice work.\r\nBut he never got a chance; he tried heaps of times to enlist as a\r\nprivate, but he had lost both thumbs and a couple of front teeth, and the\r\nrecruiting sergeant wouldn’t pass him.  However, as I say, everybody\r\nknows, now, what he _would_ have been,—and so they flock by the million\r\nto get a glimpse of him whenever they hear he is going to be anywhere.\r\nCæsar, and Hannibal, and Alexander, and Napoleon are all on his staff,\r\nand ever so many more great generals; but the public hardly care to look\r\nat _them_ when _he_ is around.  Boom!  There goes another salute.  The\r\nbarkeeper’s off quarantine now.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nSandy and I put on our things.  Then we made a wish, and in a second we\r\nwere at the reception-place.  We stood on the edge of the ocean of space,\r\nand looked out over the dimness, but couldn’t make out anything.  Close\r\nby us was the Grand Stand—tier on tier of dim thrones rising up toward\r\nthe zenith.  From each side of it spread away the tiers of seats for the\r\ngeneral public.  They spread away for leagues and leagues—you couldn’t\r\nsee the ends.  They were empty and still, and hadn’t a cheerful look, but\r\nlooked dreary, like a theatre before anybody comes—gas turned down.\r\nSandy says,—\r\n\r\n“We’ll sit down here and wait.  We’ll see the head of the procession come\r\nin sight away off yonder pretty soon, now.”\r\n\r\nSays I,—\r\n\r\n“It’s pretty lonesome, Sandy; I reckon there’s a hitch somewheres.\r\nNobody but just you and me—it ain’t much of a display for the barkeeper.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you fret, it’s all right.  There’ll be one more gun-fire—then\r\nyou’ll see.”\r\n\r\nIn a little while we noticed a sort of a lightish flush, away off on the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n“Head of the torchlight procession,” says Sandy.\r\n\r\nIt spread, and got lighter and brighter: soon it had a strong glare like\r\na locomotive headlight; it kept on getting brighter and brighter till it\r\nwas like the sun peeping above the horizon-line at sea—the big red rays\r\nshot high up into the sky.\r\n\r\n“Keep your eyes on the Grand Stand and the miles of seats—sharp!” says\r\nSandy, “and listen for the gun-fire.”\r\n\r\nJust then it burst out, “Boom-boom-boom!” like a million thunderstorms in\r\none, and made the whole heavens rock.  Then there was a sudden and awful\r\nglare of light all about us, and in that very instant every one of the\r\nmillions of seats was occupied, and as far as you could see, in both\r\ndirections, was just a solid pack of people, and the place was all\r\nsplendidly lit up!  It was enough to take a body’s breath away.  Sandy\r\nsays,—\r\n\r\n“That is the way we do it here.  No time fooled away; nobody straggling\r\nin after the curtain’s up.  Wishing is quicker work than travelling.  A\r\nquarter of a second ago these folks were millions of miles from here.\r\nWhen they heard the last signal, all they had to do was to wish, and here\r\nthey are.”\r\n\r\nThe prodigious choir struck up,—\r\n\r\n    We long to hear thy voice,\r\n    To see thee face to face.\r\n\r\nIt was noble music, but the uneducated chipped in and spoilt it, just as\r\nthe congregations used to do on earth.\r\n\r\nThe head of the procession began to pass, now, and it was a wonderful\r\nsight.  It swept along, thick and solid, five hundred thousand angels\r\nabreast, and every angel carrying a torch and singing—the whirring\r\nthunder of the wings made a body’s head ache.  You could follow the line\r\nof the procession back, and slanting upward into the sky, far away in a\r\nglittering snaky rope, till it was only a faint streak in the distance.\r\nThe rush went on and on, for a long time, and at last, sure enough, along\r\ncomes the barkeeper, and then everybody rose, and a cheer went up that\r\nmade the heavens shake, I tell you!  He was all smiles, and had his halo\r\ntilted over one ear in a cocky way, and was the most satisfied-looking\r\nsaint I ever saw.  While he marched up the steps of the Grand Stand, the\r\nchoir struck up,—\r\n\r\n    “The whole wide heaven groans,\r\n    And waits to hear that voice.”\r\n\r\nThere were four gorgeous tents standing side by side in the place of\r\nhonor, on a broad railed platform in the centre of the Grand Stand, with\r\na shining guard of honor round about them.  The tents had been shut up\r\nall this time.  As the barkeeper climbed along up, bowing and smiling to\r\neverybody, and at last got to the platform, these tents were jerked up\r\naloft all of a sudden, and we saw four noble thrones of gold, all caked\r\nwith jewels, and in the two middle ones sat old white-whiskered men, and\r\nin the two others a couple of the most glorious and gaudy giants, with\r\nplatter halos and beautiful armor.  All the millions went down on their\r\nknees, and stared, and looked glad, and burst out into a joyful kind of\r\nmurmurs.  They said,—\r\n\r\n“Two archangels!—that is splendid.  Who can the others be?”\r\n\r\nThe archangels gave the barkeeper a stiff little military bow; the two\r\nold men rose; one of them said, “Moses and Esau welcome thee!” and then\r\nall the four vanished, and the thrones were empty.\r\n\r\nThe barkeeper looked a little disappointed, for he was calculating to hug\r\nthose old people, I judge; but it was the gladdest and proudest multitude\r\nyou ever saw—because they had seen Moses and Esau.  Everybody was saying,\r\n“Did you see them?—I did—Esau’s side face was to me, but I saw Moses full\r\nin the face, just as plain as I see you this minute!”\r\n\r\nThe procession took up the barkeeper and moved on with him again, and the\r\ncrowd broke up and scattered.  As we went along home, Sandy said it was a\r\ngreat success, and the barkeeper would have a right to be proud of it\r\nforever.  And he said we were in luck, too; said we might attend\r\nreceptions for forty thousand years to come, and not have a chance to see\r\na brace of such grand moguls as Moses and Esau.  We found afterwards that\r\nwe had come near seeing another patriarch, and likewise a genuine prophet\r\nbesides, but at the last moment they sent regrets.  Sandy said there\r\nwould be a monument put up there, where Moses and Esau had stood, with\r\nthe date and circumstances, and all about the whole business, and\r\ntravellers would come for thousands of years and gawk at it, and climb\r\nover it, and scribble their names on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n{9}  The captain could not remember what this word was.
