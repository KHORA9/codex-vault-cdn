The most modern processes have been described in some\r\ndetail; care has been taken to select those which experience shows to be\r\nthoroughly reliable and to give good results.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN BEECH.\r\n\r\n_May, 1901._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\nSTRUCTURE AND CHEMISTRY OF THE COTTON FIBRE                            1\r\n  Action of Alkalies                                                   6\r\n  Action of Acids on Cellulose                                         9\r\n  Action of Sulphuric Acid on Cotton                                  10\r\n  Action of Hydrochloric Acid                                         11\r\n  Action of Nitric Acid                                               12\r\n  Action of Oxidising Agents on Cellulose or Cotton                   16\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSCOURING AND BLEACHING OF COTTON                                      23\r\n  Stains and Damages in Bleached Goods                                50\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDYEING MACHINERY AND DYEING MANIPULATIONS                             53\r\n  Hand Dyeing                                                         53\r\n  Dyeing Machines                                                     57\r\n  Dyeing, Slubbing, Sliver or Carded Cotton and Wool                  58\r\n  Cop Dyeing                                                          64\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF COTTON DYEING                          82\r\n  (1) Direct Dyeing                                                   85\r\n  (2) Direct Dyeing followed by Fixation with Metallic Salts         112\r\n  (3) Direct Dyeing followed by Fixation with Developers             128\r\n  (4) Direct Dyeing followed by Fixation with Couplers               139\r\n  (5) Dyeing on Tannic Mordant                                       147\r\n  (6) Dyeing on Metallic Mordants                                    156\r\n  (7) Production of Colour Direct upon Cotton Fibres                 181\r\n  (8) Dyeing Cotton by Impregnation with Dye-stuff Solution          198\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDYEING UNION (MIXED COTTON AND WOOL) FABRICS                         208\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDYEING HALF SILK (COTTON-SILK, SATIN) FABRICS                        225\r\n  Method of Dyeing                                                   225\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS FOLLOWING DYEING                                          239\r\n  Washing, Soaping, Drying                                           239\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTESTING OF THE COLOUR OF DYED FABRICS                                257\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL DYEING AND COMPARATIVE DYE TESTING                      262\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\nFIG.

By the term chemistry we\r\nmean not only the composition of the fibre substance itself, but also\r\nthe reactions it is capable of undergoing when brought into contact with\r\nvarious chemical substances--acids, alkalies, salts, etc. These\r\nreactions have a very important bearing on the operations of bleaching\r\nand dyeing of cotton fabrics.\r\n\r\nA few words on vegetable textile fibres in general may be of interest.\r\nFibres are met with in connection with plants in three ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, as cuticle or ciliary fibres or hairs; these are of no practical\r\nuse, being much too short for preparing textile fabrics from, but they\r\nplay an important part in the physiology of the plant.\r\n\r\nSecond, as seed hairs; that is fibres that are attached to the seeds of\r\nmany plants, such, for instance, as the common thistle and dandelion;\r\nthe cotton fibre belongs to this group of seed hairs, while there are\r\nothers, kapok, etc., that have been tried from time to time in spinning\r\nand weaving, but without much success. These seed hairs vary much in\r\nlength, from 1/4 inch to 1-1/2 inches or even 2 inches; each fibre\r\nconsists of a single unit. Whether it is serviceable as a textile fibre\r\ndepends upon its structure, which differs in different plants, and also\r\nupon the quantity available.\r\n\r\nThe third class of fibre, which is by far the most numerous, consists of\r\nthose found lying between the bark or outer cuticle and the true woody\r\ntissues of the plant. This portion is known as the bast, and hence these\r\nfibres are known as \"bast fibres\". They are noticeable on account of the\r\ngreat length of the fibres, in some cases upwards of 6 feet, which can\r\nbe obtained; but it should be pointed out that these long fibres are not\r\nthe unit fibres, but are really bundles of the ultimate fibres\r\naggregated together to form one long fibre, as found in and obtained\r\nfrom the plant. Thus the ultimate fibres of jute are really very\r\nshort--from 1/10 to 1/8 of an inch in length; those of flax are somewhat\r\nlonger. Jute, flax, China grass and hemp are common fibres which are\r\nderived from the bast of the plants.\r\n\r\nThere is an important point of difference between seed fibres and bast\r\nfibres, that is in the degree of purity. While the seed fibres are\r\nfairly free from impurities--cotton rarely containing more than 5 per\r\ncent.--the bast fibres contain a large proportion of impurity, from 25\r\nto 30 per cent. as they are first obtained from the plant, and this\r\nlarge quantity has much influence on the extent and character of the\r\ntreatments to which they are subjected.\r\n\r\nAs regards the structure of the fibres, it will be sufficient to say\r\nthat while seed hairs are cylindrical and tubular and have thin walls,\r\nbast fibres are more or less polygonal in form and are not essentially\r\ntubular, having thick walls and small central canals.\r\n\r\n=The Cotton Fibre.=--The seed hairs of the cotton plant are separated\r\nfrom the seeds by the process of ginning, and they then pass into\r\ncommerce as raw cotton. In this condition the fibre is found to consist\r\nof the actual fibrous substance itself, containing, however, about 8 per\r\ncent. of hygroscopic or natural moisture, and 5 per cent. of impurities\r\nof various kinds, which vary in amount and in kind in various\r\ndescriptions of cotton. In the process of manufacture into cotton\r\ncloths, and as the material passes through the operations of bleaching,\r\ndyeing or printing, the impurities are eliminated.\r\n\r\n=Impurities of the Cotton Fibre.=--Dr. E. Schunck made an investigation\r\nmany years ago into the character of the impurities, and found them to\r\nconsist of the following substances:--\r\n\r\n=Cotton Wax.=--This substance bears a close resemblance to carnauba wax.\r\nIt is lighter than water, has a waxy lustre, is somewhat translucent, is\r\neasily powdered, and melts below the boiling point of water. It is\r\ninsoluble in water, but dissolves in alcohol and in ether. When boiled\r\nwith weak caustic soda it melts but is not dissolved by the alkali; it\r\ncan, however, be dissolved by boiling with alcoholic caustic potash.\r\nThis wax is found fairly uniformly distributed over the surface of the\r\ncotton fibre, and it is due to this fact that raw cotton is wetted by\r\nwater only with difficulty.\r\n\r\n=Fatty Acids.=--A solid, fatty acid, melting at 55° C. is also present\r\nin cotton. Probably stearic acid is the main constituent of this fatty\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n=Colouring Matter.=--Two brown colouring matters, both containing\r\nnitrogen, can be obtained from raw cotton. One of these is readily\r\nsoluble in alcohol, the other only sparingly so. The presence in\r\nrelatively large quantities of these bodies accounts for the brown\r\ncolour of Egyptian and some other dark-coloured varieties of cotton.\r\n\r\n=Pectic Acid.=--This is the chief impurity found in raw cotton. It can\r\nbe obtained in the form of an amorphous substance of a light yellow\r\ncolour, not unlike gum in appearance. It is soluble in boiling water,\r\nand the solution has a faint acid reaction. Acids and many metallic\r\nsalts, such as mercury, chloride and lead acetate, precipitate pectic\r\nacid from its solutions. Alkalies combine with it, and these compounds\r\nform brown substances, are but sparingly soluble in water, and many of\r\nthem can be precipitated out by addition of neutral salts, like sodium\r\nand ammonium chlorides.\r\n\r\n=Albumens.=--A small quantity of albuminous matter is found among the\r\nimpurities of cotton.\r\n\r\n=Structure of the Cotton Fibre.=--The cotton fibre varies in length from\r\n1 to 2 inches, not only in fibres of the same class but also in fibres\r\nfrom different localities--Indian fibres varying from 0.8 in the\r\nshortest to 1.4 in the longest stapled varieties; Egyptian cotton fibres\r\nrange from 1.1 to 1.6 inches long; American cotton ranges from 0.8 in\r\nthe shortest to 2 inches in the longest fibres. The diameter is about\r\n1/1260 of an inch. When seen under the microscope fully ripe cotton\r\npresents the appearance of irregularly twisted ribbons, with thick\r\nrounded edges. The thickest part is the root end, or point of attachment\r\nto the seed. The free end terminates in a point. The diameter is fairly\r\nuniform through 3/4 to 7/8 of its length, the rest is taper. In Fig. 1\r\nis given some illustrations of the cotton fibre, showing this twisted\r\nand ribbon-like structure, while in Fig. 1A is given some transverse\r\nsections of the fibre. These show that it is a collapsed cylinder, the\r\nwalls being of considerable thickness when compared with the internal\r\nbore or canal.\r\n\r\nPerfectly developed, well-formed cotton fibres always present this\r\nappearance. But all commercial cottons contain more or less of fibres\r\nwhich are not perfectly developed or are unripe. These are known as\r\n\"dead fibres\"; they do not spin well and they do not dye well. On\r\nexamination under the microscope it is seen that these fibres have not\r\nthe flattened, twisted appearance of the ripe fibres, but are flatter,\r\nand the central canal is almost obliterated and the fibres are but\r\nlittle twisted. Dead fibres are thin, brittle and weak.\r\n\r\n=Composition of the Cotton Fibres.=--Of all the vegetable textile fibres\r\ncotton is found to have the simplest chemical composition and to be, as\r\nit were, the type substance of all such fibres, the others differing\r\nfrom it in several respects. When stripped of the comparatively small\r\nquantities of impurities, cotton is found to consist of a substance to\r\nwhich the name of cellulose has been given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Cotton Fibre.]\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1A.]\r\n\r\nCellulose is a compound of the three elements, carbon, hydrogen and\r\noxygen, in the proportions shown in the following analysis:--\r\n\r\nCarbon, 44.2 per cent.,\r\nHydrogen, 6.3 per cent.,\r\nOxygen, 49.5 per cent.,\r\n\r\nwhich corresponds to the empirical formula C{6}H{10}O{5}, which shows\r\nit to belong to the group of carbo-hydrates, that is, bodies which\r\ncontain the hydrogen and oxygen present in them in the proportion in\r\nwhich they are present in water, namely H{2}O.\r\n\r\nCellulose may be obtained in a pure condition from cotton by treatment\r\nwith alkalies, followed by washing, and by treatment with alkaline\r\nhypochlorites, acids, washing and, finally, drying. As thus obtained it\r\nis a white substance having the form of the fibre from which it is\r\nprocured, showing a slight lustre, and is slightly translucent. The\r\nspecific gravity is 1.5, it being heavier than water. It is\r\ncharacterised by being very inert, a property of considerable value from\r\na technical point of view, as enabling the fibres to stand the various\r\noperations of bleaching, dyeing, printing, finishing, etc. Nevertheless,\r\nby suitable means, cellulose can be made to undergo various chemical\r\ndecompositions which will be noted in some detail.\r\n\r\nCellulose on exposure to the air will absorb moisture or water. This is\r\nknown as hygroscopic moisture, or \"water of condition\". The amount in\r\ncotton is about 8 per cent., and it has a very important bearing on the\r\nspinning properties of the fibre, as it makes the fibre soft and\r\nelastic, while absolutely dry cotton fibre is stiff, brittle and\r\nnon-elastic; hence it is easier to spin and weave cotton in moist\r\nclimates or weather than in dry climates or weather. Cotton cellulose is\r\ninsoluble in all ordinary solvents, such as water, ether, alcohol,\r\nchloroform, benzene, etc., and these agents have no influence in any way\r\non the material, but it is soluble in some special solvents that will be\r\nnoted later on.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF ALKALIES.\r\n\r\nThe action of alkalies on cellulose or cotton is one of great importance\r\nin view of the universal use of alkaline liquors made from soda or\r\ncaustic soda in the scouring, bleaching and dyeing of cotton, while\r\ngreat interest attaches to the use of caustic soda in the \"mercerising\"\r\nof cotton.\r\n\r\nDilute solutions of the caustic alkalies, caustic soda or caustic\r\npotash, of from 2 to 7 per cent. strength, have no action on cellulose\r\nor cotton, in the cold, even when a prolonged digestion of the fibre\r\nwith the alkaline solution takes place. Caustic alkali solutions of from\r\n1 to 2 per cent. strength have little or no action even when used at\r\nhigh temperatures and under considerable pressure--a fact of very great\r\nimportance from a bleacher's point of view, as it enables him to subject\r\ncotton to a boil in kiers, with such alkaline solutions at high\r\npressures, for the purpose of scouring the cotton, without damaging the\r\nfibre itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Mercerised Cotton Fibre.]\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2A.]\r\n\r\nSolutions of caustic soda of greater strength than 3 per cent. tend,\r\nwhen boiled under pressure, to convert the cellulose into soluble\r\nbodies, and as much as 20 per cent. of the fibre may become dissolved\r\nunder such treatment. The action of strong solutions of caustic soda or\r\ncaustic potash upon cellulose or cotton is somewhat different. Mercer\r\nfound that solutions containing 10 per cent. of alkali had a very\r\nconsiderable effect upon the fibre, causing it to swell up and become\r\ngelatinous and transparent in its structure, each individual cotton\r\nfibre losing its ribbon-like appearance, and assuming a rod-like form,\r\nthe central canal being more or less obliterated. This is shown in Fig.\r\n2 and 2A, where the fibre is shown as a rod and the cross section in\r\nFig. 2A has no central canal. The action which takes place is as\r\nfollows: The cellulose enters into a combination with the alkali and\r\nthere is formed a sodium cellulose, which has the formula\r\nC{6}H{10}O{5}2NaOH. This alkali cellulose, however, is not a stable\r\nbody; by washing with water the alkali is removed, and hydrated\r\ncellulose is obtained, which has the formula C{6}H{10}O{5}H{2}O.\r\nWater removes the whole of the alkali, but alcohol only removes one\r\nhalf. It has been observed that during the process of washing with water\r\nthe fibre shrinks very much. This shrinkage is more particularly to be\r\nobserved in the case of cotton. As John Mercer was the first to point\r\nout the action of the alkaline solutions on cotton, the process has\r\nbecome known as \"mercerisation\".\r\n\r\nSolutions of caustic soda of 1.000 or 20° Tw. in strength have very\r\nlittle mercerising action, and it is only by prolonged treatment that\r\nmercerisation can be effected. It is interesting to observe that the\r\naddition of zinc oxide to the caustic solution increases its mercerising\r\npowers. Solutions of 1.225 to 1.275 (that is from 45° to 55° Tw. in\r\nstrength) effect the mercerisation almost immediately in the cold, and\r\nthis is the best strength at which to use caustic soda solutions for\r\nthis purpose. In addition to the change brought about by the shrinking\r\nand thickening of the material, the mercerised fibres are stronger than\r\nthe untreated fibres, and at the same time they have a stronger affinity\r\nfor dyes, a piece of cloth mercerised taking up three times as much\r\ncolouring matter as a piece of unmercerised cloth from the same\r\ndye-bath.\r\n\r\nThe shrinkage of the cotton, which takes place during the operation of\r\nwashing with water, was for a long time a bar to any practical\r\napplication of the \"mercerising\" process, but some years ago Lowe\r\nascertained that by conducting the operation while the cotton was\r\nstretched or in a state of tension this shrinkage did not take place;\r\nfurther, Thomas and Prevost found that the cotton so treated gained a\r\nsilky lustre, and it has since been ascertained that this lustre is\r\nmost highly developed with the long-stapled Egyptian and Sea Island\r\ncottons. This mercerising under tension is now applied on a large scale\r\nto produce silkified cotton. When viewed under the microscope, the\r\nsilkified cotton fibres have the appearance shown in Fig. 3, long\r\nrod-like fibres nearly if not quite cylindrical; the cross section of\r\nthose fibres has the appearance shown in Fig. 3A. This structure fully\r\naccounts for the silky lustre possessed by the mercerised fibres. Silky\r\nmercerised cotton has very considerable affinity for dye-stuffs, taking\r\nthem up much more readily from dye-baths, and it is dyed in very\r\nbrilliant shades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Silkified Cotton Fibre.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 3A.]\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Scouring and Bleaching of Cotton, some reference will\r\nbe made to the action of alkalies on cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF ACIDS ON CELLULOSE.\r\n\r\nThe action of acids on cellulose is a very varied one, being dependent\r\nupon several factors, such as the particular acid used, the strength of\r\nthe acid, duration of action, temperature, etc. As a rule, organic\r\nacids--for example acetic, oxalic, citric, tartaric--have no action on\r\ncellulose or cotton. Solutions of sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid of\r\n2 per cent. strength have practically no action in the cold, and if\r\nafter immersion the cotton or cellulose be well washed there is no\r\nchange of any kind. This is important, as in certain operations of\r\nbleaching cotton and other vegetable fibres it is necessary to sour\r\nthem, which could not be done if acids acted on them, but it is\r\nimportant to thoroughly wash the goods afterwards. When the acid\r\nsolutions are used at the boil they have a disintegrating effect on the\r\ncellulose, the latter being converted into hydrocellulose. When dried,\r\nthe cellulose is very brittle and powdery, which in the case of cotton\r\nyarn being so treated would show itself by the yarn becoming tender and\r\nrotten. The degree of action varies with the temperature (the higher\r\nthis is the stronger the action), and also according to the strength of\r\nthe acid solution. Thus a 10 per cent. solution of sulphuric acid used\r\nat a temperature of 80° C. begins to act on cotton after about five\r\nminutes' immersion, in half an hour there is a perceptible amount of\r\ndisintegration, but the complete conversion of the cotton into\r\nhydrocellulose requires one hour's immersion. A dilute acid with 8\r\nvolumes of water, used in the cold, takes three hours' immersion before\r\nany action on the cotton becomes evident.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID ON COTTON.\r\n\r\nWhen cellulose (cotton) is immersed in strong sulphuric acid the cotton\r\nbecomes gradually dissolved; as the action progresses cellulose\r\nsulphates are formed, and some hydrolytic action takes place, with the\r\nformation of sugar. This fact has long been known, but only recently has\r\nit been shown that dextrose was the variety of sugar which was formed.\r\nOn diluting the strong acid solution with water there is precipitated\r\nout the hydro or oxycelluloses that have been formed, while the\r\ncellulose sulphates are retained in solution.\r\n\r\nBy suitable means the calcium, barium, or lead salts of these\r\ncellulose-sulphuric acids can be prepared. Analysis of them shows that\r\nthese salts undergo hydrolysis, and lose half their sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe action of strong sulphuric acid has a practical application in the\r\nproduction of parchment paper; unsized paper is immersed in strong acid\r\nof the proper strength for about a minute, and then immediately rinsed\r\nin water. The acid acts upon the surface of the paper and forms the\r\ncellulose-sulphuric acid which remains attached to the surface. On\r\npassing into the water this is decomposed, the acid is washed away, and\r\nthe cellulose is deposited in an amorphous form on the paper, filling up\r\nits pores and rendering it waterproof and grease-proof. Such papers are\r\nnow largely used for packing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID.\r\n\r\nDilute hydrochloric acid of from 1° to 2° Tw. in strength, used in the\r\ncold, has no action on cellulose. Cotton immersed in acids of the\r\nstrength named and then well washed in water is not materially affected\r\nin any way, which is a feature of some value in connection with the\r\nbleaching of cotton, where the material has to be treated at two points\r\nin the process with weak acids. Boiling dilute hydrochloric acid of 10°\r\nTw. disintegrates cellulose very rapidly. The product is a white very\r\nfriable powder, which if viewed under the microscope appears to be\r\nfragments of the fibre that has been used to prepare it. The product has\r\nthe composition C{12}H{22}O{11}, and is therefore a hydrate of\r\ncellulose, the latter having undergone hydrolysis by taking up the\r\nelements of water according to the equation 2C{6}H{10}O{5} + H{2}O\r\n= C{12}H{22}O{11}. By further digestion with the acid, the\r\nhydrocellulose, as it is called, undergoes molecular change, and is\r\nconverted into dextrine. In composition hydrocellulose resembles the\r\nproduct formed by the addition of sulphuric acid which has received the\r\nname of amyloid. It differs from cellulose in containing free carboxyl,\r\nCO, groups, while its hydroxyl groups, HO, are much more active in their\r\nchemical reactions.\r\n\r\nHydrocellulose is soluble in nitric acid, 1.5 specific gravity, without\r\nundergoing oxidation. Nitrates are formed varying in composition.\r\n\r\nThe formation of hydrocellulose has a very important bearing in woollen\r\nmanufacture. It is practically impossible to obtain wool free from\r\nvegetable fibres, and it is often desirable to separate these vegetable\r\nfibres. For this purpose the goods are passed into a bath of\r\nhydrochloric acid or of weak sulphuric acid. On drying the acid converts\r\nthe cotton or vegetable fibre into hydrocellulose which, being friable\r\nor powdery, can be easily removed, while the wool not having been acted\r\non by the acid remains quite intact. The process is known as\r\n\"carbonising\". It may not only be done by means of the acids named but\r\nalso by the use of acid salts, such as aluminium chloride, which on\r\nbeing heated are decomposed into free acid and basic oxide. For the same\r\nreason it is important to avoid the use of these bodies, aluminium\r\nchloride and sulphate, zinc and magnesium chlorides, etc., in the\r\ntreatment of cotton fabrics; as in finishing processes, where the goods\r\nare dried afterwards, there is a great liability to form hydrocellulose\r\nwith the accompaniment of the tendering of the goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF NITRIC ACID.\r\n\r\nThe action of nitric acid on cellulose is a variable one, depending on\r\nmany factors, strength of acid, duration of action and temperature.\r\nNaturally as nitric acid is a strong oxidising agent the action of\r\nnitric acid on cellulose is essentially in all cases that of an oxidant,\r\nbut the character of the product which is obtained varies very much\r\naccording to the conditions just noted. When cellulose or cotton in any\r\nform is immersed in nitric acid of 1.4 to 1.5 specific gravity for a\r\nmoment, and the fibre be well washed, there is a formation of hydrate of\r\ncellulose which has a gelatinous nature. This is deposited on the rest\r\nof the material, which is not materially affected so far as regards\r\nstrength and appearance, but its power of affinity for dyes is\r\nmaterially increased. There is some shrinkage in the size of the cotton\r\nor paper acted upon.\r\n\r\nNitric acid changes all kinds of cellulose into nitro products, the\r\ncomposition of which depends upon the strength of the acid, the duration\r\nof treatment, and one or two other factors. The nitrocelluloses are all\r\nhighly inflammable bodies, the more highly nitrated burning with\r\nexplosive force. They are produced commercially and are known as \"gun\r\ncotton\" or \"pyroxyline\". The most highly nitrated body forms the basis\r\nof the explosive variety; the least highly nitrated forms that of the\r\nsoluble gun cotton used for making collodion for photographic and other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe products formed by the action of nitric acid are usually considered\r\nto be nitrocelluloses. It would appear that they are more correctly\r\ndescribed as cellulose-nitrates, for analysis indicates the presence of\r\nthe NO{3} group, which is characteristic of nitrates, and not of the\r\nNO{2} group, which is the feature of nitro bodies in general. Further,\r\nnitro compounds, when subject to the action of reducing agents, are\r\nconverted into amido compounds, as is the case, for instance, with\r\nnitro-benzene, C{6}H{5}NO{2}, into aniline, C{6}H{5}NH{2}, or with\r\nnitro-naphthalene, C{10}H{7}NO{2}, which changes into naphthylamine,\r\nC{10}H{7}NH{2}.\r\n\r\nBut the nitric acid derivatives of cellulose are not capable of\r\nconversion by reducing agents into similar amido compounds. They have\r\nthe following properties, which accord more closely with nitrates than\r\nwith nitric bodies: alkalies remove the nitric acid; cold sulphuric acid\r\nexpels the nitric acid, cellulose sulphates being formed; boiling with\r\nferrous sulphate and hydrochloric acid causes the elimination of the\r\nnitric acid as nitric oxide (on which reaction a method for determining\r\nthe degree of nitration of gun cotton is based). It is best therefore to\r\nconsider them as cellulose nitrates. Several well-characterised\r\ncellulose nitrates have been prepared, but is an exceedingly difficult\r\nmatter to obtain any one in a state of purity, the commercial articles\r\nbeing always mixtures of two or three. Those that are best known and of\r\nthe most importance are the following:--\r\n\r\nCellulose Hexa-nitrate, C{6}H{4}O{5}(NO{3}){6}. This forms the\r\nprincipal portion of the commercial explosive gun cotton, and is made\r\nwhen a mixture of strong nitric acid and strong sulphuric acid is\r\nallowed to act on cotton at from 50 to 55° F. for twenty-four hours. The\r\nlonger the action is prolonged, the more completely is the cotton\r\nconverted into the nitrate, with a short duration the finished product\r\ncontains lower nitrates. This hexa-nitrate is insoluble in ether,\r\nalcohol, or in a mixture of those solvents, likewise in glacial acetic\r\nacid or in methyl alcohol.\r\n\r\nCellulose Penta-nitrate, C{6}H{5}O{5}(NO{3}){5}, is found in\r\nexplosive gun cotton to a small extent. When gun cotton is dissolved in\r\nnitric acid and sulphuric acid is added, the penta-nitrate is thrown\r\ndown as a precipitate. It is not soluble in alcohol, but is so in a\r\nmixture of ether and alcohol, it is also slightly soluble in acetic\r\nacid. Solutions of caustic potash convert it into the di-nitrate.\r\n\r\nCellulose Tetra-nitrate, C{6}H{6}O{5}(NO{3}){4}, and Cellulose\r\nTri-nitrate, C{6}H{7}O{5},(NO{3}){3}, form the basis of the\r\npyroxyline or soluble gun cotton of commerce. It has not been found\r\npossible to separate them owing to their behaviour to solvents being\r\nvery similar. These nitrates are obtained by treating cotton with nitric\r\nacid for twenty or thirty minutes. They are characterised by being more\r\nsoluble than the higher nitrates and less inflammable. They are freely\r\nsoluble in a mixture of ether and alcohol, from which solutions they are\r\nprecipitated in a gelatinous form on adding chloroform. Acetic ether,\r\nmethyl alcohol, acetone and glacial acetic acid, will also dissolve\r\nthese nitrates.\r\n\r\nCellulose Di-nitrate, C{6}H{8}O{5}(NO{3}){2}, is obtained when\r\ncellulose is treated with hot dilute nitric acid, or when the high\r\nnitrates are boiled with solutions of caustic soda or caustic potash.\r\nLike the last-mentioned nitrates it is soluble in a mixture of alcohol\r\nand ether, in acetic ether, and in absolute alcohol. The solution of the\r\npyroxyline nitrates in ether and alcohol is known as collodion, and is\r\nused in photography and in medical and surgical work.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting applications of the cellulose nitrates is in\r\nthe production of artificial silk. Several processes, the differences\r\nbetween which are partly chemical and partly mechanical, have been\r\npatented for the production of artificial silk, those of Lehner and of\r\nChardonnet being of most importance. They all depend upon the fact that\r\nwhen a solution of cellulose nitrate is forced through a fine aperture\r\nor tube, the solvent evaporates almost immediately, leaving a gelatinous\r\nthread of the cellulose nitrate which is very tough and elastic, and\r\npossesses a brilliant lustre. Chardonnet dissolves the cellulose nitrate\r\nin a mixture of alcohol and ether, and the solution is forced through\r\nfine capillary tubes into hot water, when the solvents immediately\r\nevaporate, leaving the cellulose nitrate in the form of very fine fibre,\r\nwhich by suitable machinery is drawn away as fast as it is formed.\r\nLehner's process is very similar to that of Chardonnet. Lehner uses a\r\nsolution of cellulose nitrate in ether and alcohol, and adds a small\r\nquantity of sulphuric acid; by the adoption of the latter ingredient he\r\nis able to use a stronger solution of cellulose nitrate, 10 to 15 per\r\ncent., than would otherwise be possible, and thereby obtains a stronger\r\nthread which resists the process of drawing much better than is the case\r\nwhen only a weak solution in alcohol and ether is employed. By\r\nsubsequent treatment the fibre can be denitrated and so rendered less\r\ninflammable.\r\n\r\nThe denitrated fibres thus prepared very closely resemble silk in their\r\nlustre; they are not quite so soft and supple, nor are they in any way\r\nso strong as ordinary silk fibre of the same diameter.\r\n\r\nArtificial silk can be dyed in the same manner as ordinary silk.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF OXIDISING AGENTS ON CELLULOSE OR COTTON\r\n\r\nCellulose resists fairly well the action of weak oxidising agents; still\r\ntoo prolonged an action of weak oxidising agents has some influence upon\r\nthe cotton fibre, and it may be worth while to point out the action of\r\nsome bodies having an oxidising effect.\r\n\r\nNitric acid of about 1.15 specific gravity has little action in the\r\ncold, and only slowly on it when heated. The action is one of oxidation,\r\nthe cellulose being transformed into a substance known as oxycellulose.\r\nThis oxycellulose is white and flocculent. It tends to form gelatinous\r\nhydrates with water, and has a composition corresponding to the formula\r\nC{6}H{10}O{6}. It is soluble in a mixture of nitric and sulphuric\r\nacids, and on diluting this solution with water a tri-nitrate\r\nprecipitates out. A weak solution of soda dissolves this oxycellulose\r\nwith a yellow colour, while strong sulphuric acid forms a pink\r\ncolouration. It is important to note that nitric acid of the strength\r\ngiven does not convert all the cellulose into oxycellulose, but there\r\nare formed also carbonic and oxalic acids. When cotton is passed into\r\nstrong solutions of bleaching powder and of alkaline hypochlorites and\r\nthen dried, it is found to be tendered very considerably. This effect of\r\nbleaching powder was first observed some thirteen years ago by George\r\nWitz, who ascribed the tendering of the cotton to the formation of an\r\noxycellulose. Although the composition of this particular oxycellulose\r\nso formed has not yet been ascertained, there is reason to think that it\r\ndiffers somewhat from the oxycellulose formed by the action of the weak\r\nnitric acid. A notable property of the oxycellulose now under\r\nconsideration is its affinity for the basic coal-tar dyes, which it will\r\nabsorb directly. The oxycellulose is soluble in alkaline solutions.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary bleaching process there is considerable risk of the\r\nformation of oxycellulose by the employment of the bleaching solutions\r\nof too great a strength, or in allowing the goods to lie too long before\r\nthe final washing off. The presence of any oxycellulose in bleached\r\ncotton may be readily determined by immersing it in a weak solution of\r\nMethylene blue, when, if there be any oxycellulose present, the fibre\r\nwill take up some of the dye-stuff.\r\n\r\nPermanganate of potash is a very powerful oxidising agent. On cellulose\r\nneutral solutions have but little action, either in the cold or when\r\nheated. They may, therefore, be used for the bleaching of cotton or\r\nother cellulose fibres.\r\n\r\nAlkaline solutions of permanganate convert the cellulose into\r\noxycellulose, which resembles the oxycellulose obtained by the action of\r\nthe nitric acid.\r\n\r\nChromic acid, when used in the form of a solution, has but little action\r\non cellulose. In the presence of mineral acids, and used warm or\r\nboiling, chromic acid oxidises cellulose into oxycellulose and other\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore always advisable in carrying out any technical process\r\nconnected with cotton which involves its treatment with oxidising agents\r\nof any kind, and where it is desired not to alter the cotton, to allow\r\nthese actions to be as short as possible.\r\n\r\n=Dyes and Cotton Dyeing.=--An account of the chemistry of the cotton\r\nfibre would not be complete unless something is said about the reactions\r\ninvolved in the processes of dyeing and printing cotton. This is a most\r\ninteresting subject and opens up quite a number of problems relating to\r\nthe combination of the fibre with colouring matter of various kinds, but\r\nhere only a brief outline of the principles that present themselves in\r\nconsidering the behaviour of the cotton fibre as regards colouring\r\nmatter will be given.\r\n\r\nWhen the question is considered from a broad point of view, and having\r\nregard to the various affinities of the dyes for cotton; we notice (1)\r\nthat there is a large number of dye-stuffs--the Benzo, Congo, Diamine,\r\nTitan, Mikado, etc., dyes--that will dye the cotton from a plain bath or\r\nfrom a bath containing salt, sodium sulphate, borax or similar salts;\r\n(2) that there are dyes which, like Magenta, Safranine, Auramine and\r\nMethyl violet, will not dye the cotton fibre direct, but require it to\r\nbe mordanted or prepared with tannic acid; (3) that there are some dyes\r\nor rather colouring matters which, like Alizarine, Nitroso-resorcine,\r\nbarwood, logwood, etc., require alumina, chrome and iron mordants; (4)\r\nthat there are some dyes which, like the azo scarlet and azo colours in\r\ngeneral, cannot be used in cotton dyeing; (5) that there are a few dyes,\r\n_i.e._, indigo, which do not come under this grouping.\r\n\r\nFrom the results of recent investigations into the chemistry of dyeing\r\nit is now considered that for perfect dyeing to take place there must be\r\nformed on the fibre a combination which is called a \"colour lake,\" which\r\nconsists of at least two constituents; one of these is the dye-stuff or\r\nthe colouring matter itself, the other being either the fibre or a\r\nmordant, if such has to be used. The question of the formation of colour\r\nlakes is one connected with the molecular constitution of the colouring\r\nmatter, but much yet remains to be done before the proper functions and\r\nmode of action of the various groups or radicles in the dye-stuffs can\r\nbe definitely stated. While the constitution of the dye-stuff is of\r\nimportance, that of the substance being dyed is also a factor in the\r\nquestion of the conditions under which it is applied.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the first of the above groups of dyes, the direct dyes,\r\nthe colourist is somewhat at a loss to explain in what manner the\r\ncombination with the cotton fibre is brought about. The affinity of\r\ncellulose for dyes appears to be so small and its chemical activities so\r\nweak, that to assume the existence of a reaction between the dye-stuff\r\nand the fibre, tending to the formation of a colour lake, seems to be\r\nuntenable. Then, again, the chemical composition and constitution of the\r\ndyes of this group are so varied that an explanation which would hold\r\ngood for one might not do so for another. The relative fastness of the\r\ndyes against washing and soaping precludes the idea of a merely\r\nmechanical absorption of the dye by the fibre; on the other hand the\r\ngreat difference in the fastness to soaping and light between the same\r\ndyes on cotton and wool would show that there has not been a true\r\nformation of colour lake.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing of cotton with the second group of dyes is more easily\r\nexplained. The cotton fibre has some affinity for the tannic acid used\r\nin preparing it and absorbs it from the mordanting bath. The tannic acid\r\nhas the property of combining with the basic constituents of these dyes\r\nand forms a true colour lake, which is firmly fixed on the fibre. The\r\ncolour lake can be formed independently of the fibre by bringing the\r\ntannic acid and the dye into contact with one another.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the dyes of the third group, the formation of a colour\r\nlake between the metallic oxide and the colouring matter can be readily\r\ndemonstrated. In dyeing with these colours the cotton is first of all\r\nimpregnated with the mordanting oxide, and afterwards placed in the\r\ndye-bath, the mordant already fixed on the fibre then reacts with the\r\ndye, and absorbs it, thus dyeing the cotton. To some extent the dyeing\r\nof cotton with the basic dyes of the second group and the mordant dyes\r\nof the third group is almost a mechanical one, the cotton fibre taking\r\nno part in it from a chemical point of view, but simply playing the part\r\nof a base or foundation on which the colour lake may be formed. In the\r\ncase of the dyes of the fourth group, there being no chemical affinity\r\nof the cotton known for them, these dyes cannot be used in a successful\r\nmanner; cotton will, if immersed in a bath containing them, more or less\r\nmechanically take up some of the colour from the liquor, but such colour\r\ncan be almost completely washed out again, hence these dyes are not used\r\nin cotton dyeing, although many attempts have been made to render them\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nIndigo is a dye-stuff that stands by itself. Its combination with the\r\ncotton fibre is chiefly of a physical rather than a chemical nature; it\r\ndoes not form colour lakes in the same way as Alizarine and Magenta do.\r\n\r\nCellulose can be dissolved by certain metallic solutions and\r\npreparations:--\r\n\r\n(1) =Zinc Chloride.=--When cotton or other form of cellulose is heated\r\nwith a strong solution, 40 to 50 per cent., it slowly dissolves to a\r\nsyrupy liquid. On diluting this liquid with water the cellulose is\r\nthrown down in a gelatinous form, but more or less hydrated, and\r\ncontaining some zinc oxide, 18 to 25 per cent., in combination.\r\n\r\n(2) =Zinc Chloride and Hydrochloric Acid.=--When zinc chloride is\r\ndissolved in hydrochloric acid a liquid is obtained which dissolves\r\ncellulose; on dilution the cellulose is re-precipitated in a hydrated\r\nform. It is worth noting that the solution is not a stable one: on\r\nkeeping, the cellulose changes its character and undergoes hydrolysis to\r\na greater or less extent.\r\n\r\n(3) =Ammoniacal Copper.=--When ammonia is added to a solution of copper\r\nsulphate, there is formed at first a pale blue precipitate of copper\r\nhydroxide, which on adding excess of ammonia dissolves to a deep blue\r\nsolution--a reaction highly characteristic of copper. The ammoniacal\r\ncopper solution thus prepared has, as was first observed by John Mercer,\r\nthe property of dissolving cellulose fairly rapidly, even in the cold.\r\n\r\nIf instead of preparing the ammoniacal copper solution in the manner\r\nindicated above, which results in its containing a neutral ammonium\r\nsalt, the copper hydroxide be prepared separately and then dissolved in\r\nammonia a solution is obtained which is stronger in its action.\r\n\r\nThe cupra-ammonium solutions of cellulose are by no means stable but\r\nchange on keeping. When freshly prepared, the cellulose may be\r\nprecipitated from them almost unchanged by the addition of such bodies\r\nas alcohol, sugar and solutions of neutral alkaline salts. On keeping\r\nthe cellulose undergoes more or less hydrolysis or even oxidation, for\r\nit has been observed that oxycellulose is formed on prolonged digestion\r\nof cellulose with cupra-ammonium solutions, while there is formed a\r\nfairly large proportion of a nitrite.\r\n\r\nOn adding lead acetate to the cupra-ammonium solution of cellulose, a\r\ncompound of lead oxide and cellulose of somewhat variable composition is\r\nprecipitated. It is of interest also to note that on adding metallic\r\nzinc to the cupra-ammonium solution the copper is thrown out and a\r\nsolution containing zinc is obtained.\r\n\r\nThis action of cupra-ammonium solutions on cellulose has been made the\r\nbasis for the production of the \"Willesden\" waterproof cloths. Cotton\r\ncloths or paper are passed through these solutions of various degrees of\r\nstrength according to requirements, they are then passed through rollers\r\nwhich causes the surface to become more compact. There is formed on the\r\nsurface of the goods a deposit of a gelatinous nature which makes the\r\nsurface more compact, and the fabric becomes waterproof in character\r\nwhile the copper imparts to them a green colour and acts as a\r\npreservative. The \"Willesden\" fabrics have been found very useful for a\r\nvariety of purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSCOURING AND BLEACHING OF COTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparatory to the actual dyeing operations, it is necessary to treat\r\ncotton in any condition--loose cotton, yarn, or piece--so that the\r\ndyeing shall be properly done. Raw cotton contains many impurities,\r\nmechanical and otherwise; cotton yarns accumulate dirt and impurities of\r\nvarious kinds during the various spinning operations, while in weaving a\r\npiece of cotton cloth it is practically impossible to keep it clean and\r\nfree from dirt, etc. Before the cotton can be dyed a perfectly level and\r\nuniform shade, free from dark spots or light patches, these impurities\r\nmust be removed, and therefore the cotton is subjected to various\r\nscouring or cleansing operations with the object of effecting this end.\r\nThen again cotton naturally, especially Egyptian cotton, contains a\r\nsmall quantity of a brown colouring matter, and this would interfere\r\nwith the purity of any pale tints of blue, rose, yellow, green, etc.,\r\nwhich may be dyed on the cotton, and so it becomes necessary to remove\r\nthis colour and render the cotton quite bright. This is commonly called\r\n\"bleaching\". It is these preparatory processes that will be dealt with\r\nin this chapter.\r\n\r\n=Scouring Cotton.=--When dark shades--blacks, browns, olives, sages,\r\ngreens, etc., are to be dyed it is not needful to subject the cotton to\r\na bleaching operation, but simply to a scouring by boiling it with soda\r\nor caustic soda. This is very often-carried out in the same machine as\r\nthe goods will be dyed in; thus, for instance, in the case of pieces,\r\nthey would be charged in a jigger, this would be filled with a liquor\r\nmade from soda or from caustic soda, and the pieces run from end to end,\r\nwhile the liquor is being heated to the boil--usually half to\r\nthree-quarters of an hour is sufficient. Then the alkali liquor is run\r\nout, clean water run into the jigger and the pieces washed, after which\r\nthe dyes, etc., are run into the jigger and the dyeing done. There is\r\nusually used 2 lb. to 3 lb. of caustic soda, or 3 lb. to 4 lb. of soda\r\nfor each 100 lb. of goods so treated.\r\n\r\nIf the ordinary dyeing machines are not used for this purpose, then the\r\nordinary bleachers' kiers may be used. These will be described\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n=Bleaching of Cotton.=--Cotton is bleached in the form of yarn, or in\r\nthe finished pieces. In the latter case the method depends very largely\r\non the nature of the fabric; it is obvious that fine fabrics, like\r\nmuslins or lace curtains, cannot stand the same rough treatment as a\r\npiece of twilled calico will. Then, again, the bleaching process is\r\nvaried according to what is going to be done with the goods after they\r\nare bleached; sometimes they are sent out as they leave the\r\nbleach-house; again, they may have to be dyed or printed. In the first\r\ncase the bleach need not be of such a perfect character as in the last\r\ncase, which again must be more perfect than the second class of bleach.\r\nThere may be recognised:--\r\n\r\n(1) Market or white bleach.\r\n(2) Dyers or printers' bleach.\r\n(3) Madder bleach.\r\n\r\nAs the madder bleach is by far the most perfect of the three, and\r\npractically includes the others, this will be described in detail, and\r\ndifferences between it and the others will be then pointed out. A piece\r\nis subjected to the madder bleach which has afterwards to be printed\r\nwith madder or alizarine. Usually in this kind of work the cloths are\r\nprinted with mordant colours, and then dyed in a bath of the dye-stuff.\r\nThis stains the whole of the piece, and to rid the cloth of the stain\r\nwhere it has to be left white, it is subjected to a soap bath. Now,\r\nunless the bleach has been thorough, the whites will be more or less\r\nstained permanently, and to avoid this cloths which are to be printed\r\nwith alizarine colours are most thoroughly bleached. The madder bleach\r\nof the present day generally includes the following series of\r\noperations:--\r\n\r\n(1) Stitching.\r\n(2) Singeing.\r\n(3) Singeing wash.\r\n(4) Lime boil.\r\n(5) Lime sour.\r\n(6) Lye boil.\r\n(7) Resin boil.\r\n(8) Wash.\r\n(9) Chemicing.\r\n(10) White sour.\r\n\r\n(1) =Stitching.=--The pieces are fastened together by stitching into one\r\nlong rope, which is passed in a continuous manner through all operations\r\nin which such a proceeding is possible. This stitching is done by\r\nmachines, the simplest of which is the donkey machine, whereby the ends\r\nof the pieces, which are to be stitched together, are forced by a pair\r\nof cogwheels working together on to the needle carrying a piece of\r\nthread, this is then pulled through and forms a running stitch, a\r\nconsiderable length of thread being left on each side so as to prevent\r\nas far as possible the pulling asunder of the pieces by an accidental\r\ndrawing out of the thread.\r\n\r\nBirch's sewing machine is very largely used in bleach works. It consists\r\nessentially of a Wilcox & Gibb machine fitted on a stand so as to be\r\ndriven by power. The pieces are carried under the needle by a large\r\nwheel, the periphery of which contains a number of projecting pins that,\r\nengaging in the cloth, carry it along.\r\n\r\nThere is also a contrivance by which these pieces to be sewn can be kept\r\nstretched, this takes the form of an arm with clips at the end, which\r\nhold one end of the cloth while it is running through the machine. The\r\nclip arrangement is automatic, and just before the end passes under the\r\nneedle it is released, and the arm flies back ready for the next piece;\r\nit is, however, not necessary to use this arm always. This machine gives\r\na chain stitch sufficiently firm to resist a pull in the direction of\r\nthe length of the pieces, but giving readily to a pull at the end of the\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nThe Rayer & Lincoln machine is an American invention, and is much more\r\ncomplicated than Birch's. It consists of a sewing machine mounted on the\r\nperiphery of a large revolving wheel. This carries a number of pins,\r\nwhich, engaging in the cloth to be stitched, carry it under the needle\r\nof the machine. Besides sewing the pieces together this machine is\r\nfitted with a pair of revolving cutters which trim the ends of the\r\npieces as they pass through in a neat clean manner. There is also an\r\narrangement to mark the pieces as they are being stitched. Like Birch's\r\nit produces a chain stitch.\r\n\r\nWhat is important in sewing the ends of pieces together is to get a firm\r\nuniform stitch that lies level with the cloths without any knots\r\nprojecting, which would catch in the bleaching machinery during the\r\nprocesses of bleaching, and this might lead to much damage being done.\r\n\r\nShould it be necessary to mark the pieces so that they can be recognised\r\nafter bleaching, the best thing to use is printers' ink. Gas tar is also\r\nmuch used, and is very good for the purpose. Coloured inks do not resist\r\nthe bleaching sufficiently well to be used satisfactory. Vermilion and\r\nIndian red are used for reds, yellow ochre is the fastest of the\r\nyellows, there is no blue which will stand the process, and Guignet's\r\ngreen is the only green that will at all resist the process, umber will\r\nserve for brown. All these colours are used in the form of printing ink.\r\n\r\nThe next operation is a very important one, which cannot be too\r\ncarefully carried out, that is:--\r\n\r\n(2) =Singeing.=--For printing bleaches the cloths are singed. This has\r\nfor its object the removal from the surface of the cloth of the fine\r\nfibres with which it is covered, and which would, if allowed to remain,\r\nprevent the designs printed on from coming out with sufficient\r\nclearness, giving them a blurred appearance.\r\n\r\nSingeing is done in various ways, by passing the cloth over a red-hot\r\ncopper plate, or over a red-hot revolving copper cylinder, or through a\r\ncoke flame, or through gas flames, and more recently over a rod of\r\nplatinum made red hot by electricity.\r\n\r\nPlate singeing is the oldest of these methods and is still largely used.\r\nIn this method a semi-cylindrical copper plate is heated in a suitable\r\nfurnace to a bright red heat, the cloths are rapidly passed over it, and\r\nthe loose fibres thereby burnt off. One great trouble is to keep the\r\nplate at one uniform heat over the whole of its surface, some parts will\r\nget hotter than others, and it is only by careful attention to the\r\nfiring of the furnace that this can be obtained. To get over these\r\ndifficulties Worral introduced a roller singeing machine in which the\r\nplate was replaced by a revolving copper roller, heated by a suitable\r\nfurnace; the roller can be kept at a more uniform temperature than the\r\nplate. The singe obtained by the plate and roller is good, the principal\r\nfault being that if the cloths happen to get pressed down too much on\r\nthe hot plate the loose ends are not burnt off as they should be. With\r\nboth plate and roller the cloths are singed only on one side, and if\r\nboth sides require to be singed a second passage is necessary. Both\r\nsystems still retain their hold as the principal methods in use,\r\nnotwithstanding the introduction of more modern methods.\r\n\r\nSingeing by passing the cloths over a row of Bunsen burners has come\r\nlargely into use. This has the great advantage of being very cleanly,\r\nand of doing the work very effectually, much more thoroughly than any\r\nother method, which is due to the fact that while in the methods\r\ndescribed above only the loose fibres on the surface are burnt off; with\r\ngas all the loose fibres are burnt off. This is brought about by the gas\r\nflame passing straight through the cloth. It is not necessary to\r\ndescribe the gas singeing machine in detail. Singeing machines should be\r\nkept scrupulously clean and free from fluff, which is liable to collect\r\nround them, and very liable to fire. Some machines are fitted with a\r\nflue having a powerful draught which carries off this fluff, away from\r\nany source of danger.\r\n\r\n(3) =Singeing Wash.=--After being singed the cloths are run through a\r\nwashing machine to remove by water as much of the loose charred fibres\r\nas possible. The construction of a washing machine is well known. It\r\nconsists of a pair of large wooden rollers set above a trough containing\r\nwater and into which a constant stream of water flows. In the trough is\r\nalso fixed another wooden roller and the pieces are passed round this\r\nbottom roller and between the top rollers. The cloth is passed through\r\nand round the rollers several times in a spiral form so that it passes\r\nthrough the water in the trough frequently, which is a great advantage,\r\nas the wash is thus much more effectual. The pressure between the two\r\ntop rollers presses out any surplus water. The operation scarcely needs\r\nany further description.\r\n\r\n(4) =Lime Boil.=--After the cloth leaves the singeing or grey wash, as\r\nit is often called, it passes through the liming machine, which is made\r\nvery similar to the washing machine. In this it passes through milk of\r\nlime, which should be made from freshly slaked lime. The latter maybe\r\nprepared in a pasty form in a stone cistern. The lime used should be of\r\ngood quality, free from stones, badly burnt pieces or any other\r\ninsoluble material, so that when slaked it should give a fine smooth\r\npasty mass.\r\n\r\nLime should not be slaked too long before using, as it absorbs carbonic\r\nacid from the atmosphere, whereby carbonate of lime is formed, and this\r\nis useless for liming cloth. The pasty slaked lime may be mixed with\r\nwater to form the milk of lime, and this can be run from the cistern in\r\nwhich it is prepared into the liming machine as it is required; the\r\nsupply pipe should be run into the bottom of the trough of the liming\r\nmachine and not over the top, in which latter case it may splash on to\r\nthe cloths and lead to overliming, which is not to be desired on account\r\nof its liability to rot the cloth. The amount of lime used varies in\r\ndifferent bleachworks, and there is no rule on the subject; about 5 lb.\r\nto 7 lb. of dry lime to 100 lb. of cloth may be taken as a fair quantity\r\nto use.\r\n\r\nThe lime boil has for its object the removal or rather the\r\nsaponification of the resinous and fatty matters present in the grey\r\ncloth, either naturally or which have been added in the process of\r\nweaving, or have got upon the cloth accidentally during the processes of\r\nspinning and weaving. With these bodies the lime forms insoluble lime\r\nsoaps; these remain in the cloth, but in a form easily decomposable and\r\nremovable by treatment with acids and washing. Soda or potash is not\r\nnearly so good for this first boiling as lime--for what reason is\r\nsomewhat uncertain, but probably because they form with the grease in\r\nthe cloths soluble soaps, which might float about the kier and\r\naccumulate in places where they are not required and thus lead to\r\nstains, whereas the insoluble lime soap remains where it was formed. The\r\nlime also seems to attack the natural colouring matter of the cotton,\r\nand although the colour of the limed cloth is darker than before\r\nboiling, yet the nature of the colour is so altered that it is more\r\neasily removed in the after processes. Besides these changes the\r\nstarchy matters put into the cloth in the sizing are dissolved away.\r\nGreat care should be taken to see that the goods are evenly laid in the\r\nkiers, not too tight, or the liquor will not penetrate properly; and not\r\ntoo slack, or they will float about and get entangled and more or less\r\ndamaged. Then again care should be taken, especially when using\r\nlow-pressure kiers, to see that the supply of liquor does not get too\r\nlow, in which case the goods in the upper part of the kier are liable to\r\nget dry and are tendered thereby. So long as the goods in the kiers are\r\nnot allowed to get dry there is no risk of damage; this trouble rarely\r\narises with the Barlow and injector kiers. The inside of the kiers\r\nshould be kept well limed, so that the goods shall not come in contact\r\nwith the bare iron or metal of which the kier is constructed, as this\r\nwould be very likely to lead to stains being produced which are by no\r\nmeans easy to remove. It is usual, and it is a good plan with almost all\r\nkinds of kiers, except the Mather and Edmeston kiers, to put a number of\r\nlarge pebbles or small stones at the bottom of the kier, which serves to\r\nmake a false bottom on which the goods rest and through which the liquor\r\npenetrates and flows away. Before using, the stones should be well\r\nwashed to free them from dirt and grit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Mather & Platt's Low-pressure Bleaching Kier.]\r\n\r\nThe lime boil is carried out in what are called \"kiers\". Many forms of\r\nkiers have been devised, but the one in most general use is that known\r\nas the \"injector kier,\" of which a drawing is given in Fig. 4, of the\r\nform made by Messrs. Mather & Platt of Salford. Injector kiers are made\r\nto work either under a pressure of 40 lb. to 50 lb. of steam per square\r\ninch, when they are called high-pressure kiers, or at a pressure of 15\r\nlb. to 20 lb., when they are called low-pressure kiers. The one shown in\r\nthe drawing is intended for low-pressure kiers. The principle of\r\nconstruction is the same in all, the details varying somewhat with\r\ndifferent makers. Injector kiers consist of a hollow, upright iron\r\ncylinder made of plates riveted together; the top is made to lift off,\r\nbut can be fastened down tightly by means of bolts and nuts as shown in\r\nthe drawing. From the bottom, and placed centrally, rises a pipe, known\r\nas the puffer pipe; this terminates at the top in a rose arrangement.\r\nThe lower end of the pipe is perforated. A jet of steam is sent in at\r\nthe bottom of this pipe, and by its force any liquor at the bottom of\r\nthe kier is forced up the puffer pipe and distributed in a spray over\r\nany goods which may be in the kier. The liquor ultimately finds its way\r\nto the bottom of the kier ready to be blown up again. This circulation\r\nof the liquor can be maintained for any length of time and through its\r\nagency every part of the goods gets thorough and effectual treatment.\r\n\r\nThe length of the boil depends upon the kiers; with the open kier about\r\nten hours are usually given, with the Barlow and injector kiers, working\r\nat a pressure of 40 lb. to 50 lb., six to seven hours are given.\r\n\r\n(5) =Lime or Grey Sour.=--After the lime boil, the next operation is\r\nthat of the lime sour or grey sour as it is often called to distinguish\r\nit from a subsequent souring. The souring is done in a machine\r\nconstructed in the same way as a washing machine; the trough of the\r\nmachine is filled with hydrochloric acid at 2° Tw., which is kept ready\r\nprepared in a stone cistern and run into the machine as required (it is\r\nnot advisable to use acid stronger than this). After passing through the\r\nsour the goods are piled in a heap on the stillage for a few hours. The\r\nacid attacks the lime soap which was formed during the lime boil,\r\ndecomposes it and dissolves out the lime with the formation of calcium\r\nchloride, while the fat of the soap is liberated, the former is washed\r\naway in the subsequent washing, while the latter remains to a large\r\nextent on the goods, and is removed by the lye boil that follows.\r\nSulphuric acid is not so satisfactory to use for the lime sour as\r\nhydrochloric acid, because it forms with the lime the insoluble sulphate\r\nof calcium, which is difficult to entirely remove from the goods,\r\nwhereas the chloride is very soluble and is entirely eliminated from the\r\ngoods by the washing that follows.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to keep the acid at a uniform strength in the machine.\r\nThe Twaddell is here of no use as an indicator of the actual strength,\r\nbecause the lime which the acid dissolves, while it neutralises and\r\nreduces the strength of the acid, actually raises the Twaddell, under\r\nwhich circumstance the only safe method is a chemical test. This can be\r\ncarried out very simply and with a sufficient degree of accuracy by the\r\nworkmen, and if it be done at regular intervals during the souring, and\r\nthe supply of the fresh acid be regulated, the sour will be kept at a\r\nmore uniform strength and more uniform results will be obtained than if\r\nthe souring were done in a more empirical fashion. The test is best and\r\nmost easily done as follows:--\r\n\r\nPrepare a solution of 1 oz. of the powdered high strength 98 per cent.\r\ncaustic soda in 1 pint of water, weighing and measuring these quantities\r\nvery carefully. Now take a tall, narrow, white bottle of about 5 oz.\r\ncapacity and make a mark on the neck. Fill this bottle with the test\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nNow take exactly 5 ozs. of freshly prepared sour of 2° Tw., pour into a\r\njar, and add carefully some of the soda-test solution until a piece of\r\ncloth dyed with turmeric is turned brown, when the acid is neutralised.\r\nNow make a mark on the bottle of soda to show how much has been used. In\r\nall subsequent tests of the sour 5 ozs. should always take the same\r\nquantity of soda solution; if it takes less it is too weak, if more it\r\nis too strong; the remedy in each case is obvious. It is worth while to\r\ngraduate the test bottle for 1°, 3°, 4°, 5° Twaddell, as well as for 2°\r\nTw. acid.\r\n\r\nAfter the souring it is often the custom to pile the goods on to a\r\nwooden stillage, but the goods should not be left too long so piled up\r\nfor they may become dry, either entirely or in parts. In any case, as\r\nthe goods dry the acid becomes concentrated and attacks them and makes\r\nthem tender, which is not at all desirable. Therefore, if it is not\r\nconvenient to proceed with them for some time after souring, they\r\nshould be moistened with water from time to time, but it is best to wash\r\nthem off at once, whereby they are made ready for the next operation.\r\n\r\n(6) =Lye Boil.=--This is, perhaps, the most important operation in the\r\nwhole process of bleaching, especially if the cloths are going to be\r\nprinted in the so-called madder style with alizarine colours, or\r\notherwise stains are liable to occur in the final stage, and it is then\r\nsometimes difficult to put the blame for these upon the right shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn principle the lye boil is simple, consisting in boiling the goods\r\nwith a solution of soda ash, or caustic soda. The quantity of ash used\r\nvaries in different works, as might naturally be expected; from 170 lb.\r\nto 200 lb. of ash to 10,000 lb. of cloth is a fair proportion to use.\r\nThe length of boil averages about four hours, certainly not less than\r\nthree should be given, and it is not necessary to give more than five\r\nhours in either ordinary kiers, with central puffer pipe, or in injector\r\nkiers.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to see that the goods are well packed into the\r\nkiers, not too tightly or the lye will fail to penetrate equally all\r\nthrough, and this is important if a uniform bleach is desired; neither\r\nshould they be too loose, or they will float about and get torn. It is\r\nnot necessary to be particular about the quantity of water used, except\r\nthat it must be sufficient to keep the goods well covered, and still\r\nhave enough to keep the circulation energetic. When the water is not\r\nsufficient in amount the goods get somewhat dry; there is then a\r\nliability to tendering, but with plenty of water there is no fear of any\r\ndamage being done during a boil with alkali. Some works use caustic soda\r\ninstead of soda ash in which case less is required, from 120 lb. to 150\r\nlb. to 10,000 lb. of cloth, otherwise no alteration is made in the mode\r\nof boiling.\r\n\r\nThis lye boil clears away the fatty and waxy matter left in the goods\r\nafter the lime sour, and thus prepares the way for the next boil. There\r\nis no advantage in using caustic soda in this preliminary boil, soda ash\r\nbeing just as effective and cheaper.\r\n\r\n(7) =Resin Boil.=--Following the lye boil is the resin boil which\r\nconsists in boiling the goods in a resin soap liquor. This is made as\r\nfollows: a soda ash liquor of about 15° to 20° Tw. is prepared, and into\r\nthis is thrown resin, broken up into small pieces.\r\n\r\nThe whole is boiled up until the resin is dissolved, and then as much\r\nmore is added in small quantities as the alkali will take up. The soda\r\nliquor should not be much weaker than 20° Tw., it will then be heavier\r\nthan the resin which will float on the top, it is found to dissolve\r\nquicker and better than when the liquor is weak, in which case, the\r\nresin would sink to the bottom of the boiler and would there melt into a\r\nsingle mass difficult to dissolve. The resin soap liquor when made is\r\nready to be used. The proportions of resin and alkali used in the boil\r\nvary in different works, but, as a rule, the quantities for 10,000 lb.\r\nof goods are 430 lb. of 58 per cent. soda ash, 180 lb. of resin, and 80\r\nlb. of 70 per cent. caustic soda. Too much resin should be avoided, as\r\nit is found that with an excess the whites obtained are not nearly so\r\ngood as when the right quantity is used; on the other hand, too little\r\nacts much in the same way. It may be taken that from 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 per\r\ncent. of the weight of the goods is about the right proportion; 1 per\r\ncent. being too little, and 2 per cent. too much. The quantity of soda\r\nused should be rather more than twice that of the resin, from 3-1/2 to 4\r\nper cent. The length of boil is usually about twelve hours in a\r\nlow-pressure kier; in a high-pressure kier about seven hours is\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nWhat the special function of the resin is in this boil is not\r\ndefinitely known; but experience, both on a large and small scale,\r\nproves that it is essential to obtaining a good white for alizarine\r\nprinting; without it, when the goods are dyed with alizarine after the\r\nmordants have been printed on, they frequently take a brown stain--with\r\nthe resin this never or but rarely happens.\r\n\r\n(8) =Wash.=--After the lye boils the goods must be washed, and it is\r\nimportant that this be done in as thorough a manner as possible. With\r\nthe object of accomplishing this most thoroughly many washing machines\r\nhave been invented, the main idea in all being to bring every part of\r\nthe goods into contact with as much water as possible. Bridson's is an\r\nold form, and a very good one, the principle of this machine is to cause\r\nthe cloth to pass to and fro, and to flap upon the surface of the water\r\nin the trough of the machine.\r\n\r\nFurnival's square beater works on much the same principle, and does its\r\nwork effectively. More modern washing machines are those of Birch,\r\nFarmer, Mather & Platt, and Hawthorne, where by the peculiar\r\nconstruction of the rollers and the use of beaters the cloth is very\r\neffectually washed. These machines are much more economical in the use\r\nof water than the older forms, and yet they do their work as well, if\r\nnot better.\r\n\r\n(9) =Chemicing.=--This is the actual bleaching operation, familiarly\r\nknown as \"chemicing,\" that is, the treatment of the goods with bleaching\r\npowder. The previous operations have resulted in obtaining a cloth free\r\nfrom grease, natural or acquired, and from other impurities, but it\r\nstill has a slight brownish colour. This has to be removed before the\r\ngoods can be considered a good white, which it is the aim of every\r\nbleacher they should be.\r\n\r\nTo get rid of this colour they are subjected to some final operations,\r\nthe first of which is now to be considered. The chemicing consists in\r\nrunning the goods through a weak solution of bleaching powder (chloride\r\nof lime), piling the goods up into heaps, and allowing them to lie\r\novernight, the next day they are finished. As the cloth has received, or\r\nought to have received, a thorough bottoming, only a weak bath of chemic\r\nis required, about 1/2 to 1° Tw. is quite sufficient. The solution is\r\nprepared in a stone cistern. There is very little difficulty in making\r\nit, the only precaution necessary is to have the solution quite clear\r\nand free from undissolved particles, for if these get upon the cloth\r\nthey will either lead to the production of minute holes, or they may\r\noverbleach the fibre, which in such case will have the power of\r\nattracting excess of colour in any subsequent dyeing process and thus\r\nlead to stains, the origin of which may not be readily grasped at the\r\nfirst sight.\r\n\r\nIt is best, therefore, either to allow the solution to settle in the\r\ncistern till quite clear, which is the simplest way, or to filter\r\nthrough cloth.\r\n\r\nThe chemicing is best done cold and with weak solution, at 1/2° Tw.\r\nrather than 1° Tw. Warming the liquor increases the rapidity of the\r\nbleaching action, but there is a risk of over-chloring, which must be\r\navoided as far as possible, because there is then danger of tendering\r\nthe fibre, moreover, such over-chlored cloth has an affinity for\r\ncolouring matters that is not at all desirable, as it leads to the\r\nproduction of stains and patches in the dyeing operations. It is much\r\nbetter, when a single chemicing does not bleach the cloth sufficiently\r\nand give a white, to run the cloth twice through a weak liquor rather\r\nthan once through a strong liquor.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chemicing is followed by a sour, which, acting on the\r\nbleaching powder, liberates chlorine that bleaches the fabric, yet the\r\ngreatest proportion of the bleaching effect is brought about while the\r\npieces are being piled up into heaps between the chemicing and the sour.\r\nIn this state they should be left for some hours, covered over with a\r\ndamp sheet, care being taken that they are not left piled so long as to\r\nbecome dry, as in this event there is a great risk of tendering the\r\ncloth or fabric; it is, therefore, a good plan to moisten them with a\r\nlittle water from time to time. They should not be tightly piled up, but\r\nbe as loose as possible, so that the air can get to them, as it is the\r\ncarbonic acid and other acid vapours in the air, that by acting on the\r\nchemic causes slow liberation of chlorine, which effects the bleaching\r\nof the goods.\r\n\r\n(10) =White Sour.=--After the chemicing the goods are treated to a sour,\r\nfor which purpose either hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid possesses the advantage of forming a more soluble salt\r\nof lime (calcium chloride) than does sulphuric acid (calcium sulphate),\r\nand it has a more solvent action upon any traces of iron and other\r\nmetallic oxide stains which may be present in the goods. On the other\r\nhand, on account of its fuming properties, it is unpleasant to work\r\nwith. The souring is done by passing the goods through an acid liquor at\r\n2° Tw. strong and piling for two or three hours, after which it is\r\nwashed. This final washing must be thorough, so that all traces of acid\r\nand chemic are washed out, otherwise there is a tendency for the goods\r\nto acquire a yellowish colouration.\r\n\r\nSo far the routine has been described of the so-called madder bleach,\r\nthe most perfect kind of bleach applied to cotton cloths. Besides this\r\ntwo other kinds of bleach are distinguished in the trade. Turkey red and\r\nmarket bleach. The former is used when the cloth or yarn is to be dyed\r\nplain or self-coloured with delicate shades with Alizarine; the latter\r\nis used for cloth sold in the white. As the operations involved in\r\nproducing these are identical in their method of manipulation to those\r\nalready described, it will only be necessary to give an outline of the\r\nprocess for each one.\r\n\r\n=Turkey Red Bleach=--(1) Rinse through water into a kier and boil for\r\ntwo hours. (2) Lime boil for three to four hours. The amount of lime\r\nrequired is rather less than what is used with the madder bleach, from\r\n2-1/2 lb. to 3 lb, lime to each 1 cwt. of goods being quite sufficient.\r\n(3) Souring as in the madder bleach. (4) Lye boil, using about 100 lb.\r\ncaustic soda to a ton of goods, and giving ten hours' boil. (5) Second\r\nlye boil using about 50 lb. soda ash to a ton of goods, after which the\r\ngoods are well washed. (6) Chemicing as with the madder bleach. (7)\r\nSouring as with the madder bleach, then washing well.\r\n\r\nThis represents an average process, but almost every bleacher has his\r\nown methods, differing from the above in some of the details and this\r\napplies to all bleaching processes. It is obvious that the details may\r\nbe varied to a great extent without changing the principles on which the\r\nprocess depends.\r\n\r\n=Market Bleach=--Here all that requires to be done is to get the cloth\r\nof a sufficient degree of whiteness to please the eye of the customer.\r\nMarket bleachers have, however, to deal with a wider range of goods than\r\nis dealt with in the former kinds of bleaches, from very fine muslins to\r\nvery heavy sheetings. Now it is obvious from a merely mechanical point\r\nof view, that the former could not stand as rough a process as the\r\nlatter, therefore there must be some differences in the details of\r\nmuslin bleaching and sheeting bleaching. Then again with goods sold in\r\nthe white, it is customary to weave coloured headings or markings, and\r\nas these have to be preserved, to do so will cause some slight\r\nalteration of the details of the bleach with this object. On all these\r\npoints it is difficult to lay down general rules because of the very\r\nvarying feature of the conditions which are met with by the market\r\nbleacher.\r\n\r\nThe resin boil may be omitted, only two lye boils being required, and\r\nthese need not be so long or of such a searching character as the\r\ncorresponding boils of the madder bleach. Outlines of two or three such\r\nprocesses, which are now in use in bleach works, will serve to show the\r\ngeneral routine of a market bleach. The proportions given are calculated\r\nfor 10,000 lb. of goods:--\r\n\r\n(1) Lime boil, using 500 lb. of lime, and giving a twelve-hours' boil.\r\n(2) Grey sour, hydrochloric acid of 2° Tw., then wash well.\r\n(3) Lye boil, 100 lb. caustic soda, 70 per cent. solid, ten to twelve\r\nhours' boil; wash.\r\n(4) Second lye boil, 100 lb., 58 per cent. soda ash, twelve-hours' boil.\r\n(5) Chemic, bleaching powder liquor at 1° Tw., boil for three hours;\r\nwash.\r\n(6) White sour, sulphuric acid at 2° Tw.; wash well.\r\n\r\nThe length of boil with the lime and lyes will depend upon the quality\r\nof the goods, heavy goods will require from two to three hours longer\r\nthan will light goods, such as cambrics, the time given above being that\r\nfor heavy goods, sheetings, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother process is the following:--\r\n\r\n(1) Lime boil, using 480 lb. lime, and boiling for ten hours.\r\n(2) Grey sour, hydrochloric acid at 2° Tw.; wash.\r\n(3) Lye boil, 300 lb. soda ash, 58 per cent.; 50 lb. caustic soda, 70\r\nper cent., and 30 lb. soft soap, giving ten hours' boil; wash.\r\n(4) Chemic as above.\r\n(5) White sour as above; wash well.\r\n\r\nA smaller quantity of lime is used here, but on the other hand the lye\r\nboil is a stronger one. This process gives good results. Some bleachers\r\ndo not use lime in their market bleaches, but give two lye boils, in\r\nwhich case the process becomes:--\r\n\r\n(1) Lye boil, using 140 lb. caustic soda, of 70 per cent., giving ten\r\nhours' boil and washing well.\r\n(2) Second lye boil, using 120 lb. soda ash, 58 per cent., and giving\r\nten hours' boil; wash.\r\n(3) Chemic as above.\r\n(4) White sour as above; wash well.\r\n\r\nLight fabrics, such as laces, lace curtains, muslins, etc., cannot stand\r\nthe strain of the continuous process, and they are therefore subjected\r\nto a different bleaching process, which varies much at different bleach\r\nworks. One method is to lime by steeping for an hour in a weak lime\r\nliquor, using about 2 lb. of lime to 100 lb. of goods; they are then\r\nboiled in the kier for eight hours, after which they are washed. This\r\nwashing is done in what are called dash wheels, large hollow wheels, the\r\ninterior of each being divided into four compartments. Into these the\r\ngoods are put, and the wheel is caused to revolve, while at the same\r\ntime a current of water flows with some force into the interior of the\r\nwheel and washes the goods.\r\n\r\nThe wheels do their work well, and the action being gentle the finest\r\nfabrics can be washed without fear of any damage. It is necessary that\r\nthe speed at which they are driven should be such that as the wheel\r\nrevolves the goods are thrown from side to side of each compartment; if\r\nthe speed be too slow they will simply slide down, and then they do not\r\nget properly washed; on the other hand, if the speed be too great then\r\ncentrifugal action comes into play and the goods remain in a stationary\r\nposition in the wheels with the same result. As to the amount of\r\nwashing, it should be as before. After this washing they are boiled\r\nagain in the kier with soda ash, using about 8 lb. ash for 100 lb. goods\r\nand giving seven hours' boil, which, after washing, is followed by a\r\nsecond boil with 5 lb. ash and 4 lb. soft soap for each 100 lb. of\r\ngoods, giving eight hours' boil. They are then washed and entered into\r\nthe chemic. The chemicing is done in stone cisterns, which are fitted\r\nwith false bottoms, on which the goods can rest, and which allow any\r\ninsoluble particles of bleaching powder to settle out and prevent them\r\nfrom getting on the goods. The liquor is used at the strength of about\r\n1/2° Tw., and the goods are allowed to steep about two hours; they are\r\nthen placed in a hydro-extractor and the surplus chemic is whizzed out,\r\nafter which they are steeped in sour of hydrochloric acid at 1° Tw.,\r\nkept in a stone cistern, the goods being allowed to steep for two hours.\r\nNext they are washed, well whizzed, passed through a blueing water,\r\nwhizzed again, and dried. The remarks made when describing similar\r\noperations of the madder bleach as to the action, testing, etc., of the\r\nchemicals, are equally applicable here.\r\n\r\nAnother plan of bleaching fine fabrics is shown in outline in the\r\nfollowing scheme:--\r\n\r\n(1) Wash; boil in water for two hours.\r\n(2) Boil in soda for five hours, using 80 lb. soda ash of 58 per cent.,\r\nand 30 lb. soft soap for 1,000 lb. of goods.\r\n(3) Second soda boil, using from 40 lb. to 50 lb. soda ash, and 15 lb.\r\nto 20 lb. soft soap, giving four hours' boil; after each soda boil the\r\ngoods should be washed.\r\n(4) Chemic, using bleaching powder liquor at 1/2° Tw., allowing them to\r\nsteep for two hours, then wash and whiz.\r\n(5) White sour, using hydrochloric acid at 2° Tw., steeping two hours;\r\nwash.\r\n\r\nA further extension of the same process is sometimes given for the best\r\ngoods, which consists, after the above, in giving:--\r\n\r\n(6) A third soda boil, using 25 lb. to 30 lb. soda ash and 15 lb. to 20\r\nlb. soft soap, giving one hour's boil; washing.\r\n(7) Chemic as before.\r\n(8) Sour as before, after which the goods are well washed.\r\n\r\nIn the bleaching of Nottingham lace curtains for the soda boils there\r\nis used what is called the \"dolly,\" which consists of a large round\r\nwooden tub about 5 feet to 6 feet in diameter and about 2 feet 6 inches\r\nto 3 feet deep; this is made to revolve slowly at about one revolution\r\nper minute. Above the tub on a strong frame are arranged four stampers\r\nor beaters, which are caused to rise and fall by means of cams. The\r\ngoods are placed in the tub with the scouring liquors and the dolly is\r\nset in motion, the beaters force the liquor into the goods, and the\r\nrevolution of the tub causes the beaters to work on a fresh portion of\r\nthe goods at every fall.\r\n\r\nThis is rather an old-fashioned form of machine, and is being replaced\r\nby more modern forms of boiling kiers. In bleaching certain kinds of\r\nmuslins in which the warp threads are double, and in the case of lace\r\ncurtains, it is necessary to endeavour to keep the threads as open and\r\nprominent as possible. This cannot be done with the continuous process,\r\nwhich puts a strain on the threads and thus effaces their individuality.\r\nTo avoid this the fabrics have to be dealt with in bundles or lumps, and\r\non these no strain is put, therefore every thread retains its\r\nindividuality. The process above described is applicable.\r\n\r\n=Yarn Bleaching.=--Yarn is supplied to the bleacher in two forms: (1)\r\nwarps in which the length of the threads may vary from as little as 50\r\nto as much as 5,000 yards; these can be dealt with in much the same\r\nmanner as a piece of cloth, that is, a continuous system can be adopted;\r\n(2) hanks, which are too well known to require description. Sometimes\r\nyarn is bleached in the form of cops, but as the results of cop\r\nbleaching are not very satisfactory it is done as little as possible.\r\n\r\n=Warp Bleaching.=--The warp, if very long, is doubled two, three or four\r\ntimes upon itself, so as to reduce its length. Care should be taken that\r\nthe ends of the warp are tied together to prevent any chance of\r\nentangling, which would very likely happen if the ends were left loose\r\nto float about. As a rule, warps are not limed, but the adoption of the\r\nliming would assist the bleaching. In outline warp bleaching consists of\r\nthe following operations:--\r\n\r\n(1) Lye boil, using 30 lb. caustic soda, 70 per cent., and 50 lb. soda\r\nash, 58 per cent., giving six hours' boil, and washing.\r\n(2) Sweeting, boil with 80 lb. soda ash, 58 per cent., for two hours.\r\n(3) Washing.\r\n(4) Chemicing, bleaching powder liquor at 1° Tw., washing.\r\n(5) Sour, sulphuric acid at 2° Tw,. washing well.\r\n(6) Hydro extracting and drying.\r\n\r\nAbout 2,000 to 3,000 lb. of warps are usually treated at one time.\r\n\r\nThe machinery used may be the same as that used in the cloth bleach, and\r\neach operation may be conducted in the same manner. In some warp\r\nbleachworks, while the kiers are made in the same way, the other\r\nmachines are made differently. The chemicing and souring is done in\r\nstrong cisterns provided with a false bottom; in these the warps are\r\nallowed to remain for about two hours. A more complicated form of\r\nchemicing cistern is also in use. This is made of stone, and is provided\r\nwith a false bottom. Above is a tank or sieve, as it is called, having a\r\nperforated bottom through which the liquor flows on the warp in the\r\ncistern below.\r\n\r\nUnder the chemicing cistern is a tank into which the liquor flows, and\r\nfrom which it is pumped up into the sieve above. A circulation of liquor\r\nis thus kept up during the whole of the operation. Owing to the action\r\nof the chemic or acid on the metal work of the pump there is great wear\r\nand tear of the latter, necessitating frequent repairs. This is a defect\r\nin this form of chemicing machine. For drying the warps a\r\nhydro-extractor is first used to get the surplus liquor from the goods.\r\nThis machine is now well known, and is in use in every bleachworks,\r\nwhere it is familiarly known as the \"whiz,\" and the operation is\r\ngenerally called whizzing. Hydro-extractors are described under the head\r\nof \"Dyeing Machinery\".\r\n\r\nThe actual drying of the warps is done over the \"tins\" as they are\r\ncalled. These are a number of large cylinders measuring about 20 inches\r\nin diameter and about--for warp drying--5 feet long. Usually they are\r\narranged vertically in two tiers, each tier consisting of about five\r\ncylinders, not arranged directly one above another but in a zig-zag\r\nmanner, the centres of the first, third and fifth being in one line, and\r\nthe centres of the others in another line. The cylinders are made to\r\nrevolve by suitable driving mechanism, and into them is sent steam at\r\nabout 5 lb. to 10 lb. pressure, which heats up the cylinders, whereby\r\nthe warp passing over them is dried. This drying may be partial or\r\ncomplete, being regulated by the speed at which the warps pass over the\r\ncylinders and by the quantity of steam passed into the same. The quicker\r\nthe speed and the smaller the amount of steam, the less the warps are\r\ndried; while, on the other hand, the slower the speed and the larger the\r\namount and greater the pressure of the steam, the quicker and more\r\nthoroughly are the warps dried. As there is a great deal of water formed\r\nin the cylinders by the condensation of the steam, means are always\r\nprovided for carrying off this water, as its retention in the cylinders\r\noften leads to serious results and damage to the machine.\r\n\r\n=Hank Bleaching.=--So far as the chemical part of hank bleaching is\r\nconcerned it does not differ from that of warp bleaching; the same\r\noperations and proportions of chemicals may be used and in the same\r\norder, but there is some difference in the machinery which is used. The\r\nhanks may be manipulated in two ways: they may be either kept in\r\nseparate hanks, which is the method mostly in vogue in modern\r\nbleach-houses, or they may be linked together in the form of a chain.\r\nIn the latter case the operations and the machinery may be the same as\r\nused in the madder bleach, with a few unimportant minor differences. In\r\nthe final washing the dumping machine is used, which consists of two\r\nwooden bowls set over a wooden trough containing the wash waters. The\r\ntop bowl is covered with a thick layer of rope and merely rests on the\r\nbottom bowl by its own weight, and is driven by friction from the\r\nlatter. The chain of hanks passing through between the two bowls has the\r\nsurplus liquor squeezed out of it, and as there is considerable increase\r\nin the thickness at the points of linkage between the hanks, when these\r\npass through the bowls they lift up the top bowl, which, when the thick\r\nplaces have passed through, falls down with a sudden bump upon the thin\r\nplaces, and this bumping drives out all the surplus liquor and drives\r\nthe liquor itself into the very centre of the hanks, which is sometimes\r\nan advantage.\r\n\r\nIn modern bleach-houses the chain form is gradually giving place to the\r\nmethod of bleaching separate hanks, partly because so many improvements\r\nhave been made in the hank-bleaching machinery of late years, which\r\nenables bleachers to handle the yarn in the form of separate hanks\r\nbetter than they could do formerly; and as bleaching in separate hanks\r\nmeans that the cotton is kept in a more open form, and is thus more\r\neasily penetrated by the various liquors which are used, it follows that\r\nthe bleach will be better and more thorough, which is what the bleacher\r\naims at. At the same time weaker liquors or, what is the same thing,\r\nless material can be used, which means a saving in the cost of the\r\nprocess. For bleaching yarn in the hank the following process may be\r\nfollowed with good results:--\r\n\r\n(1) Lye boil, using 1,000 lb. yarn, 40 lb. caustic soda of 70 per cent.,\r\nand 50 lb. of soda ash of 58 per cent., giving five to six hours' boil\r\nat low pressure.\r\n(2) Wash through washing machine.\r\n(3) Second lye boil, using 40 lb. soda ash of 58 per cent., and giving\r\ntwo to three hours' boil, wash again through a washing machine.\r\n(4) Chemic as in warp bleaching.\r\n(5) Sour as in warp bleaching.\r\n(6) Wash well.\r\n(7) Hydro extract and dry.\r\n\r\nSometimes, if the yarn is to be sold in thread form, before the last\r\noperation it passes through another, _viz._, treating with soap and blue\r\nliquors, which will be dealt with presently.\r\n\r\nThe lye boils are done in the ordinary kiers, and do not call for\r\nfurther notice, except that in filling the goods into the kiers care\r\nshould be taken that while sufficiently loose to permit of the alkaline\r\nliquors penetrating through the hanks properly, yet they should be so\r\npacked that they will not float about and thus become entangled and\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\nThe washing is nowadays done in a special form of washing machine,\r\ndesigned to wash the hanks quickly and well with as little expenditure\r\nof labour and washing liquor as possible. There are now several makes of\r\nthese washing machines on the market, most of them do their work well,\r\nand it is difficult to say which is the best. Some machines are made to\r\nwash only one bundle at once, while others will do several bundles.\r\nGenerally the principle on which they are constructed is the same in\r\nall, a trough containing the ash liquor, over which is suspended a\r\nrevolving reel or bobbin, usually made of wood or enamelled iron, the\r\nbobbin being polygonal in form so that it will overcome readily any\r\nresistance the yarn may offer and carry the hank round as it revolves.\r\nThe hank dips into the wash liquor in the trough, and as it is drawn\r\nthrough by the revolution of the bobbin it is washed very effectually.\r\nThe moving of the hank opens out the threads, and thus the wash liquor\r\nthoroughly penetrates to every part of the hank, so that a few minutes'\r\nrun through this machine thoroughly washes the yarn. A constant stream\r\nof clean water is passed through the trough. This machine may also be\r\nused for soaping and sizing the hanks if required. By extending the\r\ntrough in a horizontal direction, and increasing the number of reels or\r\nbobbins, the quantity of material that can be washed at one time can be\r\nextended, although not to an indefinite extent. The workman can start at\r\none end of the machine and fill all the bobbins with yarn, by the time\r\nhe has finished this the first bobbinful will have been washed\r\nsufficiently and can be taken off and replaced with another quantity of\r\nyarn, and thus one by one the bobbins may be emptied and refilled, which\r\nmeans that a considerable amount of material can be got through in the\r\ncourse of a day. To avoid the labour of walking to and fro to fill and\r\nrefill the bobbins, washing machines are constructed in which the trough\r\nis made in a circular form. The bobbins are placed at the ends of radial\r\narms which are caused to revolve round over the trough, the workman is\r\nstationed constantly at one part of the circle, and as the arms pass him\r\nin their motion round the trough he takes off the washed hanks and puts\r\non the unwashed hanks. By this machine he is saved a very considerable\r\namount of labour, and is able to do his work in a more convenient\r\nmanner. The yarn is well washed in such a machine. The trough may be\r\nentire or it may be divided into a number of compartments, each of which\r\nmay contain a different kind of wash liquor if necessary. Of course it\r\ngoes almost without saying that in all these machines the liquors in\r\nthem may be heated up by means of steam pipes if required.\r\n\r\nThe chemicing and souring of the hanks does not call for special\r\nmention, beyond the fact that these operations are done in the same\r\nmanner as warp bleaching. In Fig. 5 is shown Mather & Platt's\r\nyarn-bleaching kier, which is designed to bleach cotton yarn, either in\r\nhanks or in the warp forms, without removing it from the vessel into\r\nwhich it is first placed. The process is as follows: The hot alkali\r\nsolution is circulated by means of a distributing pipe through the\r\naction of an injector or centrifugal pump to scour the yarn; then water\r\nis circulated by means of a centrifugal pump for washing. The chemic and\r\nsour liquors are circulated also by means of pumps, so that without the\r\nslightest disturbance to the yarn it is quickly and economically\r\nbleached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Mather & Platt's Yarn-bleaching Kier.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAINS AND DAMAGES IN BLEACHED GOODS.\r\n\r\nSome of the stains in bleached goods which are met are beyond the\r\ncontrol of the bleacher to avoid, while others are due to various\r\ndefects in the process. Now the subject of stains can only be dealt with\r\nin a very general way, because of the varying manner in which they\r\narise. The recognition of the particular way in which the stains have\r\nbeen formed is sometimes difficult to discover. First, there are iron\r\nstains, which are the most common kind of stains that a bleacher is\r\ntroubled with. These generally make their appearance in the form of red\r\nspots of greater or less extent. As a rule they are not visible before\r\nthe pieces are fully bleached. Their origin is varied. Sometimes they\r\narise from the machinery; if the kiers are not kept thoroughly\r\nwhitewashed out, there is a great liability to produce iron stains.\r\nEvery other machine which is used in the process is made of iron, and\r\nshould be kept free from rust, or the chances of stains are considerably\r\nincreased. The water used in the bleaching must be free from iron. A\r\nsmall trace will not make much difference, but some waters contain a\r\ngreat deal of iron, so much so that they are absolutely unusable for\r\nbleaching purposes. Iron stains are often due to a very curious cause:\r\nthe dropping of the oil used in the spinning or weaving machinery on to\r\nthe cotton during the process of manufacture. This oil is often charged\r\nwith iron derived from the wear and tear of the machinery, and which\r\noften gets fixed in the form of red spots of oxide on the fibre. Iron\r\nstains cannot readily be extracted.\r\n\r\nOil stains are also common. These take the form of bright yellow stains\r\nin various shapes, sometimes extending along the piece in streaks, at\r\nother times in patches in various places about the piece. Generally\r\nthese oil stains do not make their appearance as soon as the piece is\r\nbleached, and often the bleacher sends out his goods quite white and\r\napparently all right, and yet soon afterwards comes a complaint that the\r\ngoods are stained yellow. One cause of these yellow oil stains can be\r\ntraced to the use of paraffin wax in the sizing of the warps. In this\r\ncase the stains are more or less streaky in form, and extend along the\r\nlength of the piece. They are due to the fact that paraffin wax is not\r\nsaponifiable by the action of the alkalies used in the process, and is\r\ntherefore not extracted. When the goods are chemiced the chlorine acts\r\nupon the paraffin and forms chlorine compounds, which are acted upon by\r\nlight, and turn yellow by exposure to that agent and to the atmosphere.\r\nParaffin, when used for the sizing of warps, may sometimes be completely\r\nextracted from the fabric, but this depends upon the proportion of\r\ntallow or other fat which is used in the composition of the sizing\r\ngrease. If the paraffin is only present in small quantities, and the\r\ngrease well mixed, then it may be possible to extract all the paraffin\r\nout of the fabric during the bleaching process, but if the paraffin is\r\nin large proportion, or the grease not well mixed, it is scarcely\r\npossible to extract it all out, and stains must be the result. These\r\nstains can hardly be considered the fault of the bleacher, but are due\r\nto the manufacturer of the cloth using cheap sizing compositions on his\r\nwarps. There are no means which can be adopted before bleaching to\r\nascertain whether paraffin exists in the cloth. If found to be present,\r\nthe remedy which is the easiest practically is to saturate the cloth\r\nwith a little olive oil, or better, pale oleic acid. Allow the fatty\r\nmatter to soak well in, and then boil the goods in a little caustic\r\nsoda. Another cause of oil stains is the use of mineral oils in the\r\nlubrication of cotton machinery. These mineral oils partake of the\r\nnature of paraffin in their properties, and therefore they are\r\nunsaponifiable by the action of alkalies. Like paraffin wax, they\r\nresist the bleaching process, and much in the same manner produce\r\nstains. Oil stains show themselves in various forms--sometimes as spots.\r\nThese may be due to the splashing of oil from the spindles during the\r\nprocess of spinning, or they may be in patches of a comparatively large\r\nsize over the pieces.\r\n\r\nThese are perhaps due to the oil dropping on to the piece during the\r\nprocess of weaving when in the loom. The oils used for the lubrication\r\nof spinning and weaving machinery should contain a fair proportion of\r\nsome fatty oil, such as olive or rape or cocoanut oil. Not less than 10\r\nper cent. should be used. More would be better, but the cost of course\r\nwould be greater and oil is an item with spinners and manufacturers.\r\n\r\nStains are occasionally due to other causes rather too numerous to be\r\ndealt with in detail, and sometimes these stains only appear once in a\r\nlifetime, and often do not make their appearance during the bleaching\r\nprocess, but only in after dyeing or calico printing processes in\r\ncurious ways the causes of which are very baffling to find out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDYEING MACHINERY AND DYEING MANIPULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCotton is dyed in a variety of forms: raw, loose cotton, partly\r\nmanufactured fibre in the form of slubbing or sliver, spun fibres or\r\nyarns wound in cop or bobbin forms, in hanks or skeins and in warps, and\r\nlastly in the form of woven pieces. These different forms necessitate\r\nthe employment of different forms of machinery and different modes of\r\nhandling; it is evident to the least unobservant that it would be quite\r\nimpossible to subject slubbing or sliver to the same treatment as yarn\r\nor cloth, otherwise the slubbing would be destroyed and rendered\r\nvalueless.\r\n\r\nIn the early days all dyeing was done by hand in the simplest possible\r\ncontrivances, but during the last quarter of a century there has been a\r\ngreat development in the quantity of dyeing that has been done, and this\r\nhas really necessitated the application of machinery, for hand work\r\ncould not possibly cope with the amount of dyeing now done. Consequently\r\nthere has been devised during the past two decades a great variety of\r\nmachines for dyeing every description of textile fabrics, some have not\r\nbeen found a practical success for a variety of reasons and have gone\r\nout of use, others have been successful and are in use in dye-works.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAND DYEING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Rectangular Dye-tank.] [Illustration: FIG.\r\n7.--Round Dye-tub.]\r\n\r\nDyeing by hand is carried on in the simplest possible appliances; much\r\ndepends upon whether the work can be done at the ordinary temperature\r\nor at the boil. Figs. 6 and 7 show respectively a rectangular vat and a\r\nround tub much in use in dye-houses. These are made of wood, but\r\ncopper dye-vats are also made. These may be used for all kinds of\r\nmaterial, loose fibre, yarns or cloth. In the case of loose fibre this\r\nis stirred about either with poles or with rakes, care being taken to\r\nturn every part over and over and open out the masses of fibre as much\r\nas possible in order to avoid matting or clotting together. In the case\r\nof yarns or skeins, these are hung on sticks resting on the edges of the\r\ntub or vat. These sticks are best made of hickory, but ash or beech or\r\nany hard wood that can be worked smooth and which does not swell much\r\nwhen treated with water may be used. The usual method of working is to\r\nhang the skein on the stick, spreading it out as much as possible, then\r\nimmerse the yarn in the liquor, lift it up and down two or three times\r\nto fully wet out the yarn, then turn the yarn over on the stick and\r\nrepeat the dipping processes, then allow to steep in the dye-liquor.\r\nThis is done with the batch of yarn that is to be dyed at a time. When\r\nall the yarn has been entered into the dye-bath, the first stickful is\r\nlifted out, the yarn turned over and re-entered in the dye-liquor, this\r\noperation is carried out with all the sticks of yarn until the cotton\r\nhas become dyed of the required depth. In the case of long rectangular\r\nvats it is customary for two men, one on each side of the vat to turn\r\nthe yarns, each man taking charge of the yarn which is nearest to him.\r\nThe turning over one lot of yarn is technically called \"one turn\" and\r\nthe dyer often gives \"three turns\" or \"four turns\" as may be required.\r\n\r\nWoven goods may be dyed in the tub or vat, the pieces being drawn in and\r\nout by poles, but the results are not altogether satisfactory and it is\r\npreferable to use machines for dyeing piece goods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Section of Dye-vat.]\r\n\r\nPlain tubs or vats, such as those shown in Figs. 6 and 7, are used for\r\ndyeing, and otherwise treating goods in the cold, or at a lukewarm heat,\r\nwhen the supply of hot water can be drawn from a separate boiler. When,\r\nhowever, it is necessary to work at the boil, then the vat must be\r\nfitted with a steam coil. This is best laid along the bottom in a\r\nserpentine form. Above the pipe should be an open lattice-work bottom,\r\nwhich, while it permits the free circulation of boiling water in the\r\nvat, prevents the material being dyed from coming in contact with the\r\nsteam pipe. This is important if uniform shades are to be dyed, for any\r\nexcessive heating of any portion of the bath leads to stains being\r\nproduced on the material in that part of the bath. Fig. 8 shows a vat\r\nfitted with a steam pipe. That portion of the steam pipe which passes\r\ndown at the end of the vat is in a small compartment boxed off from the\r\nmain body of the vat, so that no part of the material which is being\r\ndyed can come in contact with it. A closed steam coil will, on the\r\nwhole, give the best results, as then no weakening of the dye-liquor can\r\ntake place through dilution by the condensation of the steam. Many\r\ndye-vats are, however, fitted with perforated, or, as they are called,\r\nopen steam coils, in which case there is, perhaps, better circulation of\r\nthe liquor in the dye-vat, but as some of the steam must condense, there\r\nis a little dilution of the dye-liquor in the vat.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYEING MACHINES.\r\n\r\nDye tubs and vats, such as those described above, have been largely\r\nsuperseded by machines in which the handling, or working of the\r\nmaterials being dyed is effected by mechanical means. There have been a\r\nlarge number of dyeing machines invented, some of these have not been\r\nfound to be very practical, and so they have gone out of use. Space will\r\nnot admit of a detailed account of every kind of machine, but only of\r\nthose which are in constant use in dye-works.\r\n\r\n=Dyeing Loose, or Raw Cotton.=--Few machines have been designed for this\r\npurpose, and about the only successful one is:\r\n\r\n=Delahunty's Dyeing Machine.=--This is illustrated in Fig. 9. It\r\nconsists of a drum made of lattice work, which can revolve inside an\r\nouter wooden casing. The interior of the revolving drum is fitted with\r\nhooks or fingers, whose action is to keep the material open. One segment\r\nof the drum is made to open, so that the loose cotton or wool to be dyed\r\ncan be inserted. By suitable gearing the drum can be revolved; and the\r\ndye-liquor, which is in the lower half of the wooden casing, penetrates\r\nthrough the lattice work of the drum, and dyes the material contained in\r\nit. The construction of the machine is well shown in the drawing, while\r\nthe mode of working is obvious from it and the description just given.\r\nThe machine is very successful, and well adapted for dyeing loose, or\r\nraw wool and cotton. The material may be scoured, bleached, dyed, or\r\notherwise treated in this machine.\r\n\r\nThe Obermaier machine, presently to be described, may also be used for\r\ndyeing loose cotton or wool.\r\n\r\nDYEING, SLUBBING, SLIVER OR CARDED COTTON AND WOOL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Delahunty's Dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Obermaier Dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\nIt is found in practice that the dyeing of loose wool or cotton is not\r\naltogether satisfactory--the impurities they naturally contain interfere\r\nwith the purity of the shade they will take. Then again the dyes and\r\nmordants used in dyeing them are found to have some action on the wire\r\nof the carding engine through which they are passed; at any rate a card\r\ndoes not last as long when working dyed cotton or wool as when used on\r\nundyed cotton or wool fibres. Yet for the production of certain fancy\r\nyarns for weaving some special classes of fabrics, it is desirable to\r\ndye the cotton or wool before it is spun into thread. The best plan is\r\nundoubtedly to dye the fibre after it has been carded and partly spun\r\ninto what is known as slubbing or sliver. All the impurities have been\r\nremoved, the cotton fibres are laid, straight, and so it becomes much\r\neasier to dye. On the other hand, as it is necessary to keep the sliver\r\nor slubbing straight and level, no working about in the dye-liquors can\r\nbe allowed to take place, and so such must be dyed in specially\r\nconstructed machines, and one of the best of these is the Obermaier\r\ndyeing machine which is illustrated in Fig. 10. The Obermaier apparatus\r\nconsists of a dye vat A. In this is placed a cage consisting of an inner\r\nperforated metal cylinder C, and an outer perforated metal cylinder D,\r\nbetween these two is placed the material to be dyed. C is in contact\r\nwith the suction end of a centrifugal pump P, the delivery end of which\r\ndischarges into the dye-vat A. The working of the machine is as follows:\r\nThe slubbing or sliver is placed in the space between C and D rather\r\ntightly so that it will not move about. Then the inner cage is placed in\r\nthe dye-vat as shown. The vat is filled with the dye-liquor which can be\r\nheated up by a steam pipe. The pump is set in motion, the dye liquor is\r\ndrawn from A to C, and, in so doing, passes through the material packed\r\nin B and dyes it. The circulation of the liquor is carried on as long as\r\nexperience shows to be necessary. The dye-liquor is run off, hot water\r\nis run in to wash the dyed material, and the pump is kept running for\r\nsome time to ensure thorough rinsing; then the water is run off, and by\r\nkeeping the pump running and air going through a certain amount of\r\ndrying can be effected. This machine works very well, and, with a little\r\nexperience, constant results can be obtained. The slubbing or sliver may\r\nbe scoured, bleached, rinsed, dyed, washed, soaped, or otherwise treated\r\nwithout removing it from the machine, which is a most decided advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Holliday's Yarn-dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\n=Holliday's Yarn-dyeing Machine.=--In Fig. 11 is given an illustration\r\nof a machine for dyeing yarn in the hank form made by Messrs. Read\r\nHolliday & Sons, of Huddersfield. The illustration gives a very good\r\nidea of the machine. It consists of a wooden dye-vat which can be\r\nheated by steam pipes in the usual way. Extending over the vat are a\r\nnumber of reels or bobbins; these are best made of wood or enamelled\r\niron; these reels are in connection with suitable gearing so that they\r\ncan be revolved. There is also an arrangement by means of which the\r\nreels can be lifted bodily in and out of the dye-vat for the purpose of\r\ntaking on and off, \"doffing,\" the hanks of yarn for the reels. A reel\r\nwill hold about two pounds of yarn. The working of the machine is\r\nsimple. The vat is filled with the requisite dye-liquor. The reels,\r\nwhich are lifted out of the vat, are then charged with the yarn, which\r\nhas been previously wetted out. They are then set in revolution and\r\ndropped into the dye-vat and kept there until it is seen that the yarn\r\nhas acquired the desired shade. The reels are lifted out and the hanks\r\nremoved, when the machine is ready for another lot of yarn.\r\n\r\nThere are several makes of hank-dyeing machines of this type, and as a\r\nrule they work very well. The only source of trouble is a slight\r\ntendency for the yarn on one reel if hung loosely of becoming entangled\r\nwith the yarn on one of the other reels. This is to some extent obviated\r\nby hanging in the bottom of the hank a roller which acts as a weight and\r\nkeeps the yarn stretched and so prevents it flying about.\r\n\r\nTo some makes of these machines a hank wringer is attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Klauder-Weldon Dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\n=Klauder-Weldon Hank-dyeing Machine.=--This is illustrated in Fig. 12,\r\nwhich shows the latest form. This machine consists of a half-cylindrical\r\ndye-vat built of wood. On a central axis is built two discs or rod\r\ncarriers which can revolve in the dye-vat, the revolution being given by\r\nsuitable gearing, which is shown at the side of the machine. On the\r\nouter edge of the discs are clips for carrying rods, on which one end of\r\nthe hanks of yarn is hung, while the other end is placed on a similar\r\nrod carried near the axle. The revolution of the discs carries the yarn\r\nthrough the dye-liquor contained in the lower semi-cylindrical part of\r\nthe machine previously alluded to. At a certain point, every revolution\r\nof the discs, the rods carrying the yarns are turned a little; this\r\ncauses the yarn to move on the rods, and this motion helps to bring\r\nabout greater evenness of dyeing. The most modern form of this machine\r\nis provided with an arrangement by means of which the whole batch of\r\nyarn can be lifted out of the dye-liquor. Arrangements are made by which\r\nfrom time to time fresh quantities of dye can be added if required to\r\nbring up the dyed yarn to any desired shade. This machine works well and\r\ngives good results. Beyond the necessary labour in charging and\r\ndischarging, and a little attention from time to time, as the operation\r\nproceeds, to see if the dyeing is coming up to shade, the machine\r\nrequires little attention.\r\n\r\nMany other forms of hank-dyeing machines have been devised: there is\r\nCorron's, in which an ordinary rectangular dye-vat is used. Round this\r\nis a framework which carries a lifting and falling arrangement that\r\ntravels to and fro along the vat. The hanks of yarn are hung on rods of\r\na special construction designed to open them out in a manner as nearly\r\napproaching handwork as is possible. The machine works in this way: the\r\nlifting arrangement is at one end of the vat, the hanks are hung on the\r\nrods and placed in the vat. Then the lifter is set in motion and moves\r\nalong the vat; as it does so it lifts up each rod full of yarn, turns it\r\nover, opening out the yarn in so doing, then it drops it again in the\r\nvat. When it has travelled to the end of the vat it returns, picking up\r\nthe rods of yarn in so doing, and this motion is kept up until the\r\ndyeing is completed. This machine is very ingenious.\r\n\r\nA type of machine which has been made by several makers consists of an\r\nordinary rectangular dye-vat surrounded with a framework carrying a\r\nnumber of sets of endless chains, the links of which carry fingers. The\r\nhanks of yarn are hung on rods at one end of which is a tooth wheel that\r\nwhen in position fits into a rack on the side of the vat. The action of\r\nthe machine is this: the hanks are hung on the rods and placed at the\r\nentrance end of the vat, by the moving of the chains it is carried along\r\nthe vat and at the same time revolves, thus turning over the yarn which\r\nhangs in the dye-liquor; when it reaches the opposite end of the vat,\r\nthe rod full of yarn is lifted out, carried upwards and then towards the\r\nother end of the vat when it is again dropped into the dye-vat to go\r\nthrough the same cycle of movements which is continued until the yarn is\r\nproperly dyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOP DYEING.\r\n\r\nIn weaving fancy-coloured fabrics the ordinary mode is to dye the yarn\r\nin the hank form, then those which have to be used for the weft are\r\nwound into the cop form for placing in the shuttles. The cop form is\r\nthat in which the yarn leaves the spinning frame, and necessarily apart\r\nfrom the dyeing there is labour involved in reeling it into hanks and\r\nwinding it back again into the cop form, not only so but there is\r\nnecessarily some waste made in these operations. Many attempts have been\r\nmade, with more or less success, to dye the yarn while in the cop form\r\nand so save the cost of the hanking and copping above referred to as\r\nwell as the waste which occurs. Cops cannot be satisfactorily dyed by\r\nsimple immersion in a boiling dye-bath, the outside becomes dyed but the\r\ncentral portions as often as not remain quite white, and there is a\r\ndistinct grading of colour or shade throughout the cop, the outer\r\nportions being deeply dyed while the middle portion will only have a\r\nmedium shade and the central portions either not being dyed at all or\r\nonly faintly tinted, much depending on the firmness with which the cop\r\nhas been wound. A soft, loosely wound cop is much more thoroughly dyed\r\nthan a hard, tightly wound cop. This uneven dyeing of the cops is not\r\nsatisfactory, and must be avoided if cop dyeing is to be a success. Many\r\ndyers have turned their attention to this question of dyeing yarn in the\r\ncop form, and many machines have been devised for the purpose; some of\r\nthese have not been a success, but a few have been found to yield\r\nsatisfactory results and proved in practice very successful.\r\n\r\nIn all machines for dyeing cops one principle has been adopted--that of\r\ndrawing or forcing the dye-liquor through the cop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Graemiger Cop-dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\n=Graemiger's Cop-dyeing Machine.=--This is shown in section in Figs. 13\r\nand 14. Although simple in its work it is somewhat complex in its\r\nconstruction and difficult to describe. The machine consists of a\r\ndye-vat to hold the requisite dye-liquors. In the upper portions of this\r\nis an iron casting formed with four chambers, the two lower ones of\r\nwhich are immersed in the dye-liquor while the upper chambers are above\r\nit. The sides of this casting are formed of metal plates which fit\r\ntightly against the casting and form as nearly air-and water-tight\r\njoints with it as it is possible to make. These metal plates are on a\r\nspindle and can be rotated. They are perforated and made to carry\r\nspindles, on which are placed the cops to be dyed. The two lower\r\nchambers are in connection with a pump which draws the air from them and\r\nso creates a vacuum inside the chambers. To fill this, liquor from the\r\ndye-vat passes through the cops and into the chambers, and is in turn\r\ndrawn through the pump and returned to the dye-vat. In this way there is\r\na continual circulation of dye-liquors from the vat through the cops,\r\nchambers and pump back to the vat again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Graemiger Cop-dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\nThe left upper chamber is practically a blank chamber. Those portions of\r\nthe cop carriers in contact with it are filled with cops, which are\r\nplaced on perforated spindles; the discs are given a quarter revolution\r\nwhich brings the cops into the dye-liquor and in connection with the\r\nleft lower chamber and are dyed. At the same time the section of the cop\r\ncarriers now in contact with the left top chamber is filled with a new\r\nlot of cops, another quarter of a revolution is given to the cop\r\ncarriers, which immerse the new lot of cops in the dye-liquor. The third\r\nquarter of the cop plates is filled with cops. A third movement of the\r\ncop plates now takes place; this brings the first lot of cops out of the\r\ndye-liquor and in contact with the right upper chamber, where the\r\nsurplus liquor is drawn out of them and returned to the dye-vat. Another\r\nrevolution brings the cops back to their first position, they are now\r\nremoved and a new lot substituted. These proceedings go on\r\ncontinuously. Although not quite free from defects the machine gives\r\nvery good results, the cops being very uniformly dyed through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--- Beaumont's Cop-dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\n=Beaumont's Cop-dyeing Machine.=--This is illustrated in Fig. 15. It\r\nconsists of a copper hemispherical dye-vessel, which is provided with a\r\ntightly fitting lid, although this is not needed in all cases. The\r\nbottom of the vessel is in communication with the suction end of a\r\ncentrifugal pump, while the delivery end of the pump is attached to the\r\nupper end of the dye-vessel, the action of the pump being to secure a\r\nconstant circulation of dye-liquor from the bottom to the top of the\r\ndye-vessel. Arrangements are provided by a peculiar and ingenious\r\ncontrivance fitted in one side of the dye-kettle for introducing steam\r\nto heat the dye-liquor to any required degree. As in most forms of\r\ncop-dyeing machines, the cops are placed on perforated metal spindles.\r\nThe cops and spindles are inserted in holes in a perforated metal plate,\r\nand over them is placed a thin metal plate, technically called the\r\nantifloater, whose object is to prevent the cops from becoming detached\r\nfrom the plate. This plate, full of cops, is now placed in the\r\ndye-vessel and rests upon a flange which is provided for that purpose.\r\nWhen the cop plate is in position the dye-vessel is divided into two\r\nchambers--a lower chamber and an upper one, in the latter being the\r\ncops.\r\n\r\nThe pump draws liquor from the chamber under the cop plate and so\r\ncreates a vacuum, which during the working of the machines ranges from\r\n10 to 20 inches in degree. To supply this vacuum, dye-liquor is drawn\r\nfrom the upper chamber through the cops. The pump returns the liquor to\r\nthe dye-vessel. A very rapid circulation of dye-liquor takes place, from\r\n25 to 50 gallons per minute passing through the cops and pump. From five\r\nto ten minutes is sufficient to dye the cops. The machine is simple in\r\nits construction and gives good results, the cops being completely dyed\r\nthrough. One important consideration in cop dyeing is to be able to dye\r\nsuccessive batches of cops to exactly the same shade, and this is quite\r\npossible with this machine.\r\n\r\n=Young & Crippin's Cop-dyeing Machine.=--So far as simplicity of\r\nconstruction is concerned this lies between the two preceding machines.\r\nIt consists of four parts with some accessory mechanism. There is first\r\na dye-liquor storage tank at the base of the apparatus in which the\r\nliquor is kept stored and boiling (if necessary) ready for use, above\r\nthis and at the front end is the dye-chamber, this communicates at its\r\nlower end by a pipe with the dye-liquor in the dye-vat. Then there is a\r\nlarge vacuum chamber, in which by means of an injector a vacuum can be\r\nformed, this directly communicates with a liquor-receiving chamber\r\nwhich again in turn is in communication with the upper part of the\r\ndye-chamber. The cops are placed on perforated spindles as usual, and\r\nthese on a perforated plate and are kept in place by a plate which is\r\nscrewed down on them. The charged cop plate is placed in the dye-chamber\r\non which a cover is placed and screwed down. By means of a lever the\r\ninjector is set at work, a vacuum created in the vacuum and receiving\r\nchambers, the consequence being that dye-liquor is drawn from the vat\r\nthrough the cops in the dye-chamber into the receiving chamber. When a\r\ncertain quantity of liquor has passed through, by a movement of a lever,\r\nthe vacuum is destroyed, and the dye-liquor runs back into the dye-vat;\r\nthese operations are repeated until from past experience of the working\r\nof the machine it is thought sufficient has passed through to dye the\r\ncops, when the dye-chamber is opened and the cops taken out. This\r\nmachine works very well.\r\n\r\n=Mommer's Cop-dyeing Machine.=--This is in use in several continental\r\ndye-works. The central portion of this machine is a rectangular\r\ndye-chamber, which can be hermetically closed by hinged doors, the cops\r\nare placed side by side on trays provided with perforated bottoms, the\r\ntrays being placed one on the top of the other in the dye-chamber. From\r\nthe top of the dye-chamber passes a pipe to a centrifugal pump, and a\r\nsimilar pipe passes from the bottom of the chamber to the pump. A\r\nseparate vat contains the dye-liquor which is used. The pump forces the\r\ndye-liquor through the cops which take up the dye. Arrangements are\r\nprovided by which the direction of the flow of the dye-liquor can be\r\nchanged. This machine gives fairly good results, not perhaps equal to\r\nthose with the machines previously described.\r\n\r\n=Warp-dyeing Machines.=--Although many warps, especially for fancy\r\nfabrics, are prepared from yarns dyed in the hank or cop form, yet it\r\nis found advantageous when a warp is of one colour, a self-colour as it\r\nis called, to form the warp from grey or white yarns and to dye it after\r\nwarping. If the warp were so wound as to be able to go into a Obermaier\r\ndyeing machine, it would be possible to dye it in that machine, but\r\ngenerally warps are dyed in the open form and are passed through a\r\ndyeing vat, commonly called a warp-vat which is constructed as shown in\r\nFig. 16. These warp-dyeing machines generally consist of a long\r\nrectangular wooden dye-vat, divided by two partitions into three\r\ncompartments, each provided with steam pipes to heat up its contents;\r\nbetween the first and second and between the second and third\r\ncompartments is fitted a pair of squeezing rollers, while the third\r\ncompartment is fitted with a heavier pair of squeezing rollers. Motion\r\nis given to these rollers by suitable gearing, and they serve to draw\r\nthe warp through the machine. Guide rollers are fitted in the\r\ncompartment, and the warp being taken round these, it passes several\r\ntimes up and down and through the dye-liquors contained in the\r\ncompartments. These warp-dyeing machines may be made of sufficient width\r\nto take one, two, three or more warps at one time as desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Warp-dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\nThe three compartments of the machine may contain different liquids or\r\nall the same liquid according as the nature of the shade to be dyed\r\ndemands. The passage is done slowly so as to give the warp time to\r\nabsorb the liquors and take up the dye. When all the length of warp has\r\nbeen sent through, it is said to have been dyed \"one end\". Sometimes\r\nthis will be enough, but often it is not, and so the warp is sent\r\nthrough again, given another end, and still again if the full shade has\r\nnot been attained.\r\n\r\nAfter being dyed in this machine the warp is sent through another one\r\ncontaining various wash liquors to finish the process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Warp-dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\nFig. 17 shows a warp-dyeing machine similar to, but a little more\r\nelaborate in construction than, the vats just described.\r\n\r\n=Piece-dyeing Machines.=--Wherever it is possible it is far more\r\npreferable to dye textile fabrics in the form of woven pieces rather\r\nthan in the yarn from which they are woven. During the process of\r\nweaving it is quite impossible to avoid the material getting dirty and\r\nsomewhat greasy, and the operations of scouring necessary to remove this\r\ndirt and grease has an impairing action on the colour if dyed yarns\r\nhave been used in weaving it. This is avoided when the pieces are woven\r\nfirst and dyed afterwards, and this can always be done when the cloths\r\nare dyed in one colour only. Of course when the goods are fancy goods\r\ncontaining several colours they have to be woven from dyed yarns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Dye-jiggers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Dye-jigger.]\r\n\r\nThe most common form of machine in which pieces are dyed is The Jigger,\r\ncommonly called the jig. This is shown in Figs. 18 and 19. It consists\r\nof a dye-vessel made sufficiently long to take the piece full\r\nwidth--wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. At the top at each side\r\nis placed a large winding roller on which the cloth is wound. At the\r\nbottom of the jig is placed a guide roller round which passes the cloth.\r\nIn some makes of jigs (Fig. 19) there are two guide rollers at the\r\nbottom and one at the top, as shown in the illustration, so that the\r\ncloth passes several times through the dye-liquor. In working, the cloth\r\nis first wound on one of the rollers, then threaded through the guide\r\nrollers and attached to the other winding roller. When this is done\r\ndye-liquor is run into the jig, the gearing set in motion, and the cloth\r\nwound from the full on to the empty roller. With the object of keeping\r\nthe piece tight, a heavy press roller is arranged to bear on the cloth\r\non the full roller. When all the cloth has passed from one roller to the\r\nother it is said to have been given \"one end\". The direction of motion\r\nis now changed, and the cloth sent in the opposite direction through the\r\njig, and the piece has now received another \"end\". This alternation from\r\none roller to the other is continued as long as is deemed necessary,\r\nmuch depending on the depth of colour which is being dyed--some pale\r\nshades may only take two or three ends, deeper shades may take more.\r\nWhen dyeing wool with acid colours which are all absorbed from the\r\ndye-liquor, or the bath is exhausted, it is a good plan to run the\r\npieces several more ends so as to ensure thorough fixation of the dye on\r\nthe cloth.\r\n\r\nIt is not advisable in working these jigs to add the whole of the dye to\r\nthe liquor at the commencement, but only a part of it; then when one end\r\nis given, another portion of the dye may be added; such portions being\r\nalways in the form of solution. Adding dyes in powder form inevitably\r\nleads to the production of colour specks on the finished goods. The\r\nreason for thus adding the dye-stuff in portions is that with some dyes\r\nthe affinity for the fibre is so great that if all were added at once it\r\nwould all be absorbed before the cloth had been given one end; and,\r\nfurther, the cloth would be very deep at the front end, while it would\r\nshade off to no colour at the other end. By adding the dye in portions\r\nthis difficulty is overcome and more level shades are obtained; it is\r\nmet with in all cases of jigger dyeing, but it is most common in dyeing\r\ncotton or wool with basic dyes like magenta, auramine, methyl violet or\r\nbrilliant green, and in dyeing wool with acid dyes like acid green,\r\nformyl violets, azo scarlet, or acid yellow.\r\n\r\nSome attempts have been made to make jiggers automatic in their\r\nreversing action, but they have not been successful; owing to the\r\ngreatly varying conditions of length of pieces, their thickness, etc.,\r\nwhich have to be dyed, and it is next to impossible to make all\r\nallowances for such varying conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20--Jig Wince.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Cloth-dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\n=The Jig Wince or Wince Dye Beck.=--This dyeing machine is very largely\r\nused, particularly in the dyeing of woollen cloths. It is made by many\r\nmakers, and varies somewhat in form accordingly. Figs. 20, 21 and 22,\r\nshow three forms by different makers. In any make the jig wince, or\r\nwince dye beck, consists of a large rectangular, or, in some cases,\r\nhemicylindrical dye-vat. Probably the best shape would be to have a vat\r\nwith one straight side at the front, and one curved side at the back. In\r\nsome a small guide roller is fitted at the bottom, under which the\r\npieces to be dyed pass. Steam pipes are provided for heating the\r\ndye-liquors. The becks should be fitted with a false bottom made of\r\nwood, perforated with holes, or of wooden lattice work, and below which\r\nthe steam pipes are placed; the object being to prevent the pieces from\r\ncoming in contact with the steam pipe, and so preventing the production\r\nof stains. Above the dye-vat, and towards the back, is the wince, a\r\nrevolving skeleton wheel, which draws the pieces out of the dye-vat at\r\nthe front, and delivers them into it again at the back. The construction\r\nof this wince is well shown in the drawings. The wince will take the\r\npieces full breadth, but often they are somewhat folded, and so several\r\npieces, four, five or six strings as they are called, can be dealt with\r\nat one time. In this case a guide rail is provided in the front part of\r\nthe machine. In this rail are pegs which serve to keep the pieces of\r\ncloth separate, and so prevent entanglements. The pieces are stitched\r\nend to end so as to form an endless band. When running through the vat\r\nthey fall down in folds at the back part of the beck, and are drawn out\r\nof the bottom and up in the front. Each part thus remains for some time\r\nin the dye-liquor, during which it necessarily takes up the dye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Dye Beck.]\r\n\r\nIn the jig and wince dyeing machines the pieces necessarily are for a\r\npart of the time, longer in the case of the jigger than in that of the\r\nwince, out of the dye-liquor and exposed to the air. In the case of\r\nsome dyes, indigo especially, this is not desirable, and yet it is\r\nadvisable to run the cloth open for some time in the liquor, so as to\r\nget it thoroughly impregnated with the dye-liquor, or to become dyed.\r\nThis may be done on such a machine, as is shown in Fig. 24, page 79, but\r\nhaving all the guide rollers below the liquor, so that at no time is the\r\npiece out of the liquor, except, of course, when entering and leaving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Holliday's Machine for Hawking Cloth.]\r\n\r\nThe so-called hawking machines have also this object in view, and Fig.\r\n23 is an illustration of Holliday's hawking machine, made by Messrs.\r\nRead Holliday & Sons, of Huddersfield. There is the dye-vat as usual; in\r\nthis is suspended the drawing mechanism, whose construction is well\r\nshown in the drawing. This is a pair of rollers driven by suitable\r\ngearing, between which the cloth passes, and by which it is drawn\r\nthrough the machine. A small roller ensures the cloth properly leaving\r\nthe large rollers; then there is a lattice-work arrangement over which\r\nthe pieces are drawn. In actual work the whole of this arrangement is\r\nbelow the surface of the dye-liquor in the vat. The piece to be dyed is\r\nthreaded through the machine, the ends stitched together. Then the\r\narrangement is lowered into the dye-vat and set into motion, whereby the\r\ncloth is drawn continuously in the open form through the dye-liquor,\r\nthis being done as long as experience shows to be necessary. This\r\nhawking machine will be found useful in dyeing indigo on cotton or wool,\r\nor in dyeing cotton cloths with such dyes as Immedial blacks, Cross-dye\r\nblacks, Amidazol blacks, Vidal blacks, where it is necessary to keep the\r\ngoods below the surface of the dye-liquor during the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Continuous Dyeing Machine.]\r\n\r\nFig. 24 shows a form of cloth-dyeing machine much used in the cotton\r\ntrade. It consists of a number of compartments fitted with guide rollers\r\nat top and bottom, and round which the cloth is threaded, so that it\r\npasses up and down in the dye-liquor several times. Between each two\r\ncompartments is a pair of squeezing rollers to press out all surplus\r\nliquors. All the compartments may be filled with the same dye-liquor, or\r\nwith different dye-liquors and developing liquors, as may be most\r\nconvenient and required for the work in hand. Such a machine is used in\r\ndyeing logwood black, aniline black, and many of the direct colours,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFrom the direct colours a large number of light shades are dyed on to\r\ncotton cloth by the process known as padding; this consists in passing\r\nthe cloth through a liquor containing the dye-stuff, usually a little\r\nphosphate of soda is added, then between squeezing rollers, and finally\r\ndrying the cloth. For this process there is used what is called a\r\npadding machine. This is shown in Figs. 25 and 26.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Padding Machine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Padding Machine.]\r\n\r\nIt consists essentially of a trough, which contains two or more guide\r\nrollers, and in this is placed the padding liquor. Above the trough is\r\nfitted squeezing rollers, sometimes two as in Fig. 25, or three as in\r\nFig. 26. Besides these, there are winding and beaming and other guide\r\nrollers. Fig. 25 shows the simplest padding machine, where the cloth\r\npasses once through the liquor and through the squeezing rollers. In\r\nFig. 26 the cloth passes several times through the liquor and twice\r\nthrough the squeezing rollers, thus ensuring a more perfect impregnation\r\nof the cloth with the dye-liquor, and therefore a more uniform dyeing of\r\nthe cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF COTTON DYEING.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents of cotton dyeing should have a good knowledge of the principles\r\nthat underlie the processes of dyeing cotton fabrics. It is only by\r\nrecognising these principles and then endeavouring to apply them to each\r\nindividual case of dyeing, that the dyer or student will obtain a\r\nthorough grasp of his subject. It is the aim of the author to lay down\r\nthese principles in a clear and intelligible form. Cotton is dyed in its\r\nloose raw condition, as yarn in the form of hanks, yarn in the form of\r\ncops, and in the woven pieces of every kind. Formerly the idea was\r\nprevalent among cotton dyers that the process which succeeds with piece\r\ngoods would not answer with yarns. It is now recognised however that\r\nthis is not so, that a process which will dye cotton yarn will also dye\r\ncotton piece goods or loose cotton. The differences which do exist in\r\nthe practical working of the processes entirely arise from the\r\ndifference in the form in which the cotton is presented to the dyer, for\r\nit must be obvious to any one that the mode of handling a piece of\r\ncotton cloth during the time it is in the dye-bath must be different\r\nfrom that of a hank of yarn, a parcel of loose cotton or a number of\r\ncops. The various machines used for dyeing all these forms and the\r\nmanner of working them have been already described.\r\n\r\nThe dyes, whether natural--derived from the various dye-woods, etc.--or\r\nartificial--prepared from coal tar--may according to their varied\r\nchemical composition and constitution be divided into seventeen or\r\neighteen distinct groups, but it is not intended here to give any\r\naccount of them; the reader is referred to other books such as _The\r\nDictionary of Coal Tar Colours_, by George H. Hurst; _The Chemistry of\r\nCoal Tar Colours_, by Benedikt and Knecht; or _The Chemistry of Organic\r\nColouring Matters_, by Nietzki, where the composition and properties of\r\nthe dyes are fully described.\r\n\r\nFrom the manner in which the various dyes are applied to cotton, linen,\r\nwool and other fibres we can divide them into five groups, thus:--\r\n\r\n     Group 1. Direct dyes.\r\n       \"   2. Basic dyes.\r\n       \"   3. Acid dyes.\r\n       \"   4. Mordant dyes.\r\n       \"   5. Miscellaneous dyes.\r\n\r\nFirst group, direct dyes, are now very numerous; they dye cotton, linen\r\nand other vegetable fibres from a plain bath, and do not require those\r\nfibres to be prepared in any way. Hence the reason of their being named\r\ndirect, or by some the substantive colours. They will also dye wool and\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\nThe second group, basic dyes, comprise some of the oldest of the\r\ncoal-tar dyes; they dye wool and silk direct from plain baths, but\r\nrequire cotton, linen and other vegetable fibres to be previously\r\nprepared in baths of tannic acid, sumach or other tanning material.\r\n\r\nThe third group, acid dyes, are very numerous, and from both their\r\nchemical composition and mode of dyeing can be divided into several\r\nsub-groups. Their principal feature is that they dye wool and silk from\r\nbaths containing Glauber's salt and some acid, hence their name of \"acid\r\ndyes\". They do not dye cotton or linen well, some not at all, others are\r\nabsorbed to a slight extent by the cotton, but only pale tints are\r\nproduced, while others may be used along with metallic mordants to dye\r\nbright but pale and fugitive shades. The acid dyes comprise such as Acid\r\ngreen, Formyl violet, Acid magenta, Azo scarlet, Orange. Thiocarmine R.,\r\nPatent blues, Wool greens, indigo extract, Eosines, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fourth group, mordant dyes, includes the alizarine series of\r\ncoal-tar colours, logwood, Brazil wood and most natural colours, and\r\nsome others. The principal feature of these dyes is that they require\r\nthe cotton to be prepared with some metallic oxide, like those of\r\nchrome, alumina and iron, before dyeing, and the colour which is got\r\ndepends partly upon the particular dye-stuff used and partly upon the\r\noxide with which the cotton has been prepared.\r\n\r\nThe fifth group includes a few dyes like indigo, which are dyed on to\r\ncotton by various and special processes.\r\n\r\nThe processes of cotton dyeing employed to-day may be comprised under\r\neight heads, namely:--\r\n\r\n(1) Direct dyeing.\r\n(2) Direct dyeing followed by fixation with metallic salts.\r\n(3) Direct dyeing followed by fixation with developers.\r\n(4) Direct dyeing followed by fixation with couplers.\r\n(5) Dyeing on tannic mordant.\r\n(6) Dyeing on metallic mordant.\r\n(7) Developing the colour direct on fibre.\r\n(8) Dyeing by impregnating the cotton with the dye-stuff,\r\nfollowed by oxidation or steaming.\r\n\r\nIt is of course not easy to elaborate a simple scheme of grouping the\r\nprocesses that shall definitely include all processes, but the above\r\ngrouping will be found as successful as any, and each will be considered\r\nas fully as is deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) DIRECT DYEING.\r\n\r\nNothing in the history of cotton dyeing caused such a revolution in the\r\nmethods of working as did the introduction some fifteen years ago of the\r\nforerunners (Congo red, Benzo purpurine, Chrysamine, Azo blue) of the\r\nnow numerous group of direct dyes, followed as they were by the Benzo,\r\nCongo, Diamine, Titan, Chicago and Zambesi members of the group. Prior\r\nto their introduction cotton dyeing was always more or less complicated\r\nand mordanting methods had to be employed.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the direct dyes cotton dyeing has become even\r\nmore simple than wool or silk dyeing, and now all that is necessary is\r\nto prepare a dye liquor containing the necessary amount of dye-stuff and\r\nGlauber's salt, or common salt or soda, or some similar body, or a\r\ncombination thereof. The method of working is to place the cotton in a\r\nlukewarm or even in a hot bath, raise to the boil, allow the goods to\r\nremain in the boiling bath for half an hour to an hour, then take them\r\nout, wring, wash and dry. This method is simple and will answer for all\r\nthe dyes of this group. There are some that do not require the working\r\nto be done boiling; it is simply needful to enter the cotton into a\r\nboiling bath and work without steam until the bath has cooled down.\r\nFurious boiling is not needed--a gentle simmer gives the best results.\r\nUneven dyeing seems to be an impossibility in this group of dyes, unless\r\nthe cotton is dirty; no matter how the operations are carried on, level\r\ndyeing is the rule not the exception. An enormous variety of shades and\r\ntints can be obtained from these dyes, and they can be combined together\r\nin every conceivable manner and proportions.\r\n\r\nNo satisfactory explanation has yet been given as to what feature in the\r\nchemical composition of these dye-stuffs give them such an affinity for\r\nthe cotton fibre as to enable them to dye in so simple a manner such\r\nfast shades as they do; it is a fact there is such an affinity and there\r\nthe matter must rest.\r\n\r\nIt has been found in practice that the efficiency of the dyeing\r\noperation depends, primarily of course, on the particular dye-stuff\r\nused, but also upon other factors, that a certain assistant be used.\r\nSome dyes work on the cotton better from a bath containing Glauber's\r\nsalt, while with others common salt works best, while a little soda\r\nalong with the salt facilitates the dyeing in some cases. It is\r\npractically impossible to specify here the best assistant for all the\r\ndirect colours, on account of the great number of such dyes which are\r\nknown, but in the practical recipes given below much useful advice will\r\nbe found. Then the quantity of such assistants used is of much\r\nimportance; there is one proportion at which the best results are\r\nobtained for each dye. The dyer should find out for himself by\r\nexperiment and the use of the dyes he employs in his work what assistant\r\nand how much is best, and make his baths up to that strength. With some\r\ndyes 10 per cent. of the assistant will be found sufficient, while with\r\nothers, 25 to 30 per cent. will not be too much. The percentage refers\r\nto the weight of the cotton that is taken.\r\n\r\nOne function of the assistants must be pointed out here: it is that in\r\nsome cases they--especially the alkaline ones, soda, potash, borax,\r\nphosphate of soda--help the dyeing by promoting the solubility of the\r\ndye-stuff in the bath, thereby retarding the exhaustion of the bath and\r\nensuring the production of level shades.\r\n\r\nThe following formulas show the application of the foregoing principles\r\nto the dyeing of numerous shades on to cotton and also the dyes which\r\nare applicable, some of the combinations which are possible with these\r\ndirect dyes, and give some idea of the tints and shades of the colours\r\nthat can be got by their means. The best assistants to use are also\r\nindicated in the formulæ.\r\n\r\nAll the formulæ here given and all that will be given in future chapters\r\nare intended for 100 lb. weight of cotton fabrics in any condition,\r\nwhether of loose cotton, yarn in cops, hanks or wraps and woven fabrics\r\nof every kind.\r\n\r\n_Bright Red._--Dye with 3 lb.

Dianil dark blue R, 3 lb. soda, and 20 lb. salt at the\r\nboil for one hour.\r\n\r\nGreens are largely produced by mixing yellows and blues together as will\r\nbe seen from the recipes given above; the particular shade of green\r\nwhich is got from a combination of blue and green depends upon the\r\nquality of the dye-stuffs used: thus, to produce bright greens of a pure\r\ntone, it is essential that the yellow used shall have a greenish tone\r\nlike Thioflavine S, Thiazole yellow, or Dianil yellow 3 G, while the\r\nblue must also have a greenish tone like Diamine sky blue, Benzo blue 3\r\nB, etc. By using yellows like Diamine fast yellow R, and dark blues like\r\nBenzo azurine 3 R, Diamine blue R W, Dianil dark blue R, the green which\r\nis got is darker and duller in tone. The addition of such a dye as\r\nDiamine black B H throws the shade more on to an olive, while a brown\r\ndye-stuff, like Diamine brown M, or an orange dye, like Titan orange N,\r\nthrows the green on to a sage tone. Examples of these effects will be\r\nfound among the recipes given above.\r\n\r\nIt may be added here that by using smaller quantities, but in the same\r\nproportions as given in the above recipes, a great range of tints and\r\nshades of green can be dyed from very pale to very deep.\r\n\r\n_Bright Blue._--Prepare a dye-bath with 1/2 lb.

Dye for one hour at the boil;\r\nlift, rinse and dry.\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient here to deal with the question of the fastness of\r\nthe direct dyes to such influences as light, air, acids, alkalies,\r\nwashing and soaping, that have a very material influence on the use of\r\nthese dyes in dyeing various fabrics. This matter can only be dealt with\r\nhere in very general terms, for space is limited and the dyes are too\r\nnumerous for detailed mention. They vary very greatly in degrees of\r\nfastness, some are absolutely fast to all influences; the blacks are\r\namong the fastest, generally these resist washing and soaping, stand\r\nacids well and are fast to alkalies, light however affects them more or\r\nless, though they cannot be reckoned fugitive colours. The few direct\r\ngreens known are good colours; they stand washing, soaping and light\r\nwell, but they are affected by acids and alkalies. The blues vary very\r\nmuch, generally they stand soaping and have a fair degree of fastness to\r\nlight, acids have but little action, alkalies tend to redden the shade,\r\nwhile heat also affects them. The direct browns are very variable; they\r\nare in general not fast to light; they stand washing and soaping and\r\nresist alkalies, but are altered by acids slightly. The yellows rank\r\namong the fastest of colours to light and washing and soaping; acids\r\nhave but little effect; they are reddened by alkalies. Among the reds\r\nthere is great variation in properties, generally they are not fast to\r\nlight, standing washing and soaping well and resisting weak alkalies;\r\nsome of them, such as the Benzo purpurines and Congo reds are very\r\nsensitive to acids, being turned blue with very weak acids, but on\r\nwashing or soaping the original colour comes back; others, like the\r\nTitan reds, Diamine reds and Delta purpurines are not so sensitive, but\r\nthese are affected by moderately strong acids; there are one or two reds\r\nlike Benzo fast scarlet 4 B S and Purpuramine D H, which are fast to\r\nacids. The depth of shade which is dyed has some considerable influence\r\non the degree of fastness, the deeper shades of a colour are always\r\nfaster than the paler shades, particularly as regards light, a\r\ndifference of 1/2 per cent, of dye-stuff has been known to make a very\r\nappreciable degree of difference as regards the fastness of a colour to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn dyeing cotton with all the direct dyes, it is found that the whole of\r\nthe dye-stuff is not removed from the dye-bath, how much is taken up by\r\nthe cotton, and the depth of the shade which is dyed upon the cotton\r\nchiefly depends upon three factors:--\r\n\r\n(1) Volume of water used.\r\n(2) Quantity of saline salts used.\r\n(3) Degree of affinity of the dye-stuff for the fibre.\r\n\r\nThere may also be some minor factors such as temperature at which the\r\ndyeing is carried on, the character and condition of the fabrics being\r\ndyed, etc.\r\n\r\nThe volume of water used in making the dye-bath has a very great\r\ninfluence upon the amount of dye taken up by the cotton, the greater the\r\nvolume of water the less dye is absorbed and the paler the colour which\r\nis produced upon the fibre. It is therefore important to use as little\r\nwater as possible in making up the dye-bath, indeed, for anything like\r\ngood results to be obtained with some dyes, especially those of the\r\nsulphur series like Vidal black, Immedial blacks, Katigen browns,\r\nCross-dye blacks, Amidazol blacks, etc., it is necessary to employ what\r\nis called a short bath, that is making it as strong as possible. The\r\nproportion of water with such dyes should not exceed fifteen times the\r\nweight of the cotton being dyed, that is, for every pound of cotton,\r\n1-1/2 gallons of water can be allowed. This will suit the dyeing of\r\nyarns and loose fabrics like knitted stockings and hosiery goods very\r\nwell. In the case of dyeing piece goods on a jigger or continuous dyeing\r\nmachines even stronger liquors can be used with advantage. With some of\r\nthe older, direct dyes like Congo red, Benzo azurine, Diamine scarlets,\r\nthe proportion of water may be increased to twenty times the weight of\r\nthe cotton. In any case the quantity of water used should not exceed\r\ntwenty-five times the weight of the cotton.\r\n\r\nThe second factor, the quantity of saline salts, like Glauber's salt,\r\nsoda, borax, etc., added in the dyeing, is not without influence,\r\ngenerally the more that is added the more dye there is left in the bath,\r\nbut here again much depends upon the salt and the colouring matters\r\nused. Some salts, more particularly Glauber's salt and common salt, tend\r\nto throw some dye-stuffs out of the bath, and so the more there is used\r\nof them the deeper the shade produced on the fabric. It is quite\r\nimpossible, having regard to the scope of this book, to deal with this\r\nquestion in detail. The dyer should ascertain for himself the best salts\r\nand the best proportions of these to use with the particular dyes he is\r\nusing. The recipes given above will give him some ideas on this point.\r\n\r\nThe third factor, the degree of affinity of the dye for the cotton\r\nfibre, has some influence on the depth of shade which can be dyed from\r\nany given strength of the dye-bath. There is a very considerable\r\ndifference among the direct dyes in this respect. There are some which\r\nhave a fair degree of affinity, while there are others which have but\r\nlittle affinity, and while in the former case there is little dye left\r\nin the bath, in the latter case there is a good deal. When dyeing plain\r\nshades with single dye-stuffs this is not of much moment, because if the\r\nbath be kept for further use, as will be spoken of presently, the bath\r\nmay be brought up to its original strength by adding a proportionate\r\namount of dye-stuff, but when compound shades are being dyed, using two\r\nor more dyes, then this feature has some influence, for they will not be\r\nabsorbed by the fibre in the same proportion as they were put in the\r\nbath, and so when making up the dye-bath for the second lot, and adding\r\nthe same proportion of dyes, the shade which is produced will not be\r\nquite the same, for the first lot of cotton in taking up the dyes in\r\nvarying quantities has altered their relative proportions, and so the\r\nbath for the second lot of cotton will actually contain more of one dye\r\nthan did the first bath, and the influence of this excess of the one\r\nconstituent will show itself in the shade ultimately dyed. The more lots\r\nof cotton there are dyed in the bath the greater will this influence be.\r\nThe dyer must by practical experience find out for himself in what\r\ndirection this feature of the direct dyes exerts its influence on the\r\nparticular dyes he is working with and make due allowance.\r\n\r\nIt is found in practice that from one-fourth to one-half of the original\r\nweight of dye-stuff is left in the bath, and in order to be as\r\neconomical as possible a custom has arisen of keeping the bath and using\r\nit again for dyeing further lots of cotton. In thus making a continuous\r\nuse of dye-baths it is important in preparing the baths for the next lot\r\nof cotton to add first the requisite quantities of dye-stuffs, how much\r\nwill depend upon the factors and conditions already detailed, but from\r\none-half to three-fourths of the original quantities are added.\r\nPractical experience alone is the guide to be followed.\r\n\r\nHaving added the dye-stuff, then sufficient water must be added to bring\r\nup the volume of the bath to the proper amount, for it will have lost\r\nsome. The loss of water arises from two sources: first there is the\r\nevaporation, which always occurs when dye-baths are heated up, and,\r\nsecond, there is the mechanical loss due to its absorption by the\r\nmaterial which is being dyed. When a piece of cotton or other textile\r\nfabric is immersed in a dye liquor it absorbs mechanically some of it,\r\nand this amount may be roughly put down as about its own weight; thus\r\n100 lb. weight of cotton will take up 10 gallons of liquor and carry\r\nthat quantity out of the bath. To some extent this may be minimised by a\r\nprevious wetting out of the cotton, which will then have in it as much\r\nliquor as it will take up, and so practically no more will be taken up\r\nfrom the dye-bath. Any loss of volume which may thus occur can be\r\nremedied by the addition of water.\r\n\r\nThe dye-baths containing in solution, in addition to the dye-stuff,\r\nsalt, or Glauber's salt, or any other added substance, the cotton in\r\ntaking up the dye liquor will of course take up some of these in\r\nproportion to the volume of liquor absorbed. The amount may range from 4\r\noz. to 1 lb. per gallon of liquor, and if 100 lb. cotton is being dyed\r\nand takes up from 10 to 15 gallons of liquor, it is obvious that it must\r\nabsorb from 3 to 10 lb. of saline matter, and as the salinity of the dye\r\nliquor is of some importance in dyeing direct colours, in making up the\r\nbath for the next lot of cotton this must be allowed for and suitable\r\nadditions made. In order to do this properly it is a good plan to rely\r\nupon the Twaddell.\r\n\r\nThe dyer should take the Twaddell of his bath before use and always make\r\nup his baths to that strength. This will be found to range from 3° to\r\n12° Tw.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, a dye-bath made from 120 gallons of water with 20\r\nlb. to 25 lb. common salt or Glauber's salt with the dye-stuffs will\r\nstand at 4° Tw., one made with 50 lb. common salt or Glauber's salt at\r\n8° Tw., while one which is made with 80 lb. to 100 lb. salt will stand\r\nat 12° to 13° Tw. If the dyer always maintains his liquors at one\r\nuniform degree Twaddell he can invariably depend upon getting uniform\r\nshades from his dye-baths. This uniform strength is attained by adding\r\nmore salt or more water as the case may require.\r\n\r\nOf course the continuous working of dye-baths cannot go on for ever;\r\nsooner or later the baths become thick and dirty, and then they must be\r\nthrown away and a new bath started.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) DIRECT DYEING FOLLOWED BY FIXATION WITH METALLIC SALTS.\r\n\r\nIt is an acknowledged principle in dyeing that to produce colours fast\r\nto washing, soaping and rubbing, there must be produced on the fibre an\r\ninsoluble coloured substance. Now as the direct dyes do not essentially\r\nproduce such insoluble bodies when dyed on the cotton, the colours they\r\nform are not always fast to washing and soaping. It has been\r\nascertained, however, that some of the direct dyes, _e.g._, Benzo\r\nazurine, Chicago blue, Catechu browns, Diamine blues, Diamine browns,\r\netc., are capable of uniting with metallic bodies to form insoluble\r\ncolour lakes, and this combination can take place on the fibre. Fast\r\nshades may be dyed with the dye-stuffs named above, and with others of\r\nthis group, by first dyeing them in the usual way, then passing through\r\na boiling bath containing bichromate of potash or copper sulphate,\r\neither together or separately. The two fixing agents here named have\r\nbeen found to be the best, although others, as, for instance, zinc\r\nsulphate, chromium fluoride and iron sulphate have been tried. With some\r\ndyes there is little or no alteration in shade, but in others there is\r\nsome change, thus the blues as a rule tend to become greener in tone,\r\nand browns also tend to acquire a greener tone and deeper shade. The\r\ntreated shades thus obtained are notable for considerable fastness to\r\nwashing, soaping and light. It is to be noted that bichromate of potash\r\nexercises both a fixing and an oxidising action on dye-stuffs, hence it\r\nis needful to use it with some degree of caution and not in too great an\r\namount, otherwise with some dyes there is a risk of over-oxidation, and\r\nin consequence poor shades will be developed. The following recipes will\r\nserve to show what dyes may thus be used, and the colours that can be\r\nobtained with them.\r\n\r\n_Dark Red._--Use in the dye-bath 3 lb. Diamine fast red F, 3 lb. soda\r\nand 20 lb. Glauber's salt, work at the boil for one hour, then lift,\r\nrinse and pass into a boiling bath containing 3 lb. fluoride of chromium\r\nfor ten to fifteen minutes, then lift, rinse and dry. By using 1 lb. of\r\nthe dye-stuff in the same way a light red shade is got.\r\n\r\n_Orange._--Dye at the boil for one hour with 1 lb. Chrysamine G, 3 lb.\r\nsoap and 10 lb. Glauber's salt, then rinse and fix in a fresh boiling\r\nbath with 1 lb. bichromate of potash, 3 lb. sulphate of copper and 2 lb.\r\nacetic acid.\r\n\r\n_Yellow._--Dye with 3-1/2 lb. Diamine yellow N, 3 lb. soap and 15 lb.\r\nphosphate of soda, then fix with 4 lb. fluoride of chromium.\r\n\r\n_Gold Yellow._--Prepare the dye-bath with 3 lb. Benzo chrome brown 5 G,\r\n1 lb. soda ash, 12 lb. Glauber's salt. Dye at the boil for one hour and\r\nrinse. This gives an orange brown. To get the yellow shade, afterwards\r\nchrome with 3 lb. bichromate of potash, 3 lb. sulphate of copper, 1 lb.\r\nacetic acid, in a fresh bath.

Diamine jet black Cr, 1 lb. soda and 20 lb.\r\nGlauber's salt, fixing with 4 lb. bichromate of potash and 2 lb. acetic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient here to deal with a small but growing and\r\nimportant class of dye-stuffs which contain sulphur in their\r\ncomposition, and which, therefore, are named:--\r\n\r\n=Sulphur or Sulphyl Colours.=\r\n\r\nThe original type of this group is Cachou de laval, sent out a good many\r\nyears ago, but of late years Vidal black, St. Dennis black, Cross-dye\r\nblacks and drab, Immedial blacks, blues and browns, Amidazol blacks,\r\nbrowns and olives, Sulfaniline black and brown, Katigen blacks, greens\r\nand browns, etc., have been added, and the group is likely to become a\r\nvery numerous one in the future.\r\n\r\nAll these colours are dyed on to the cotton or linen from baths\r\ncontaining soda and salt, while some require the addition of sodium\r\nsulphide or caustic soda in order to have the dye-stuff properly\r\ndissolved. They are very weak dyes compared with the direct colours, and\r\nrequire from 20 to 60 per cent. to produce full shades, although of this\r\nfully one-third remains in the bath unabsorbed by the cotton. It is,\r\ntherefore, important in order to work as economically as possible to\r\nretain the bath, bringing it up to strength by the addition of fresh\r\ndye-stuffs, etc.\r\n\r\nMost of the dyes require the dyed goods to pass through a second bath of\r\nsome reagent, bichromate of potash, sulphate of copper, etc., in order\r\nto fully develop and fix the dye on the fabric.\r\n\r\nThe best method of using the various dyes of this group will be given in\r\nthe form of formulæ. Two points of importance are to use as strong a dye\r\nliquor as possible, and to expose the cotton as little as possible to\r\nthe air during the dyeing operation. The dye-stuffs when exposed to the\r\nair readily become oxidised, and are thereby converted into insoluble\r\nproducts which become fixed on the fibre in a loose form, and in that\r\ncase the dyed fibre rubs rather badly.\r\n\r\n_Pale Brown._--Prepare a dye-bath with 15 lb. Cachou de laval, 10 lb. of\r\nsoda, and 10 lb. salt. The bath is not exhausted of colouring matter,\r\nand by adding one-half of the above quantities of dye-stuff and salt may\r\nbe used again for another lot of cotton. After the dyeing the cotton is\r\npassed into a fixing bath of 2 lb. bichromate of potash and 1 lb. acetic\r\nacid, working at 180° F. ten to fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n_Black._--Prepare the dye-bath with 200 gallons of water, 10 lb. soda,\r\n10 lb. sulphide of sodium, 60 lb. salt and 16 lb. Immedial black V\r\nextra. Work at the boil for one hour, keeping the cotton well under the\r\nsurface during the operation, in the case of yarns this is effected by\r\nusing bent iron rods on which to hang the hanks in the vat, in the case\r\nof pieces by working with vats the guide rollers of which are below the\r\nsurface of the dye liquor. After the dyeing the yarn or pieces are\r\nsqueezed, well rinsed in water, then passed into the fixing bath, which\r\ncontains 2 lb. sulphate of copper, 2 lb. bichromate of potash and 3 lb.\r\nof acetic acid, for half an hour at 170° to 180° F. Bichromate of potash\r\nused alone gives a reddish shade of black, sulphate of copper a greenish\r\nshade, a mixture of the two gives a greenish shade.\r\n\r\nThere are three brands of Immedial black, _viz._, V extra, G extra and\r\nF F, which vary a little in the tone of black they produce. The method\r\nof using is identical for all three. The dye-bath is not exhausted of\r\ncolour and so should be kept standing, for each subsequent lot of cotton\r\nadd 8 lb. Immedial black and 3 lb. sulphide of soda, and to every 10\r\ngallons of water added to bring the bath up to volume 1/2 lb. soda and 3\r\nlb. salt.\r\n\r\nThese blacks are very fast to washing, light, etc. By using smaller\r\nquantities of dye-stuff good greys can be dyed.\r\n\r\n_Black._--Prepare the dye-bath with 10 lb. soda, 10 lb. sulphide of\r\nsodium, 60 lb. salt and 25 lb. Vidal black, work at the boil for one\r\nhour, then rinse and fix with 3 lb bichromate of potash and 2 lb.\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n_Black._--Prepare the dye-bath with 30 lb. Cross-dye black B, 10 lb.\r\nsoda, 150 lb. salt. Dissolve the dye-stuff in boiling water, then add\r\nthe soda crystals and finally the salt. Enter the previously well-boiled\r\ncotton at about 175° F. After a few turns raise the temperature to the\r\nboil as quickly as possible, and work for one hour (just at the boil).\r\nLift and thoroughly rinse without delay. (The better the cotton is\r\nwashed the clearer the ultimate shade.) After washing, wring up and let\r\nair age for about one hour; the intensity of the black is thereby\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile prepare a bath with 5 lb. bichromate of potash, 4 lb.\r\nsulphuric acid (168° Tw.). Enter at 150° to 160° F., and work at this\r\nfor about ten minutes. After chroming, wash thoroughly to remove all\r\ntraces of acid. At this stage, the usual softening may take place if\r\ndesirable, and finally dry at a low temperature.\r\n\r\nThe bath is kept up for further lots, and three-fourths the quantity of\r\ncolouring matter, and about half soda and one fourth salt are used.\r\nWood, or iron cisterns are most suitable, and copper pans or pipes must\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\nThe dye-bath should be kept as short as possible, about twelve to\r\nfifteen times the amount of water on the weight of cotton is advisable.\r\nThe cotton when in the dye-bath should be exposed as little as possible\r\nto the air.\r\n\r\nThere are several brands of these Cross-dye blacks varying in the tone\r\nof black they give.\r\n\r\n_Black._--Prepare the dye-bath with 5 lb. soda ash, 200 lb. salt and 20\r\nlb. Amidazol black G, this is heated to 150° F., the cotton is entered,\r\nthe heat raised to the boil, and the dyeing done for an hour at that\r\nheat. Lift, rinse well, then pass into a chroming bath, made from 5 lb.\r\nbichromate of potash and 3 lb. sulphuric acid, used at 160° F. for\r\ntwenty minutes, then lift, wash well and dry. The bath may be kept\r\nstanding and used for other lots of cotton by replenishing with about\r\ntwo-thirds of the original weight of dye-stuff and a little soda. There\r\nare four brands of these Amidazol blacks which dye from a jet black with\r\nthe G to a deep blue black with the 6 G brand. The G, 2 G, and 4 G, used\r\nin small quantities, 2-1/2 to 3 lb., dye good greys of a bluish tone,\r\nthe 6 G gives a dull blue, the 4 G and 6 G, used in the proportions of\r\n7-1/2 to 10 per cent., give dark blues.\r\n\r\nAll these blacks may be combined with aniline black with good results as\r\nshown in the following recipe:--\r\n\r\n_Black._--Prepare the dye-bath with 10 lb. Amidazol black 2 G, 5 lb.\r\nsoda and 100 lb. salt. Work at the boil for an hour, then rinse, pass\r\ninto a cold bath made from 2-1/2 lb. aniline oil, 2-1/2 lb. hydrochloric\r\nacid, 6-1/2 lb. sulphuric acid, 7-1/2 lb. bichromate of potash, and\r\n5-1/2 lb. perchloride of iron, 66° Tw. This is used cold for an hour,\r\nthen the heat is slowly raised to 160° F., when the operation is\r\nfinished, and the cotton is taken out well rinsed and finished as usual.\r\nAny of this class of black may be so topped with aniline black if\r\nthought necessary A very fast black is thus got.\r\n\r\n_Black._--Make the dye-bath with 15 lb. Sulfaniline black G, 60 lb.\r\nsalt, 10 lb. soda, and 5 lb. sulphide of sodium. Work at a little under\r\nthe boil, then lift, rinse well and pass into a hot bath of 3 lb.\r\nbichromate of potash, 3 lb. sulphate of copper, and 4 lb. acetic acid\r\nfor half an hour, then lift, rinse well and dry.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in the practical application on a large scale of\r\nthese sulphur blacks that the cotton is liable to become tendered on\r\nbeing stored, although there are few signs of such after the dyeing is\r\nfinished. The exact cause of this is somewhat uncertain, the most\r\nprobable reason is that during the process of dyeing a deposit of\r\nsulphur in a fine state of division has been thrown down on the cotton\r\nby decomposition of the dye-stuff, and that this sulphur has in time\r\nbecome oxidised to sulphuric acid which then exerts its well-known\r\ntendering action on the cotton.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for this evil lies partly with the dye manufacturer and\r\nchiefly with the dyer. The dye manufacturer should see that his product\r\nis made as free from sulphur as possible, while the dyer by careful\r\nattention to thorough washing, thorough fixation in the chrome, etc.\r\nbaths, tends to eliminate all sulphur from the goods, and so prevent all\r\npossibility of the cotton becoming affected.\r\n\r\n_Blue._--Make the dye-bath with 22 lb. Immedial blue C, 13 lb. sulphide\r\nof sodium, 50 lb. salt and 15 lb. caustic soda lye at 70° Tw. Work at\r\njust under the boil for one hour, keeping the goods well under the\r\nsurface of the liquor. After the dyeing the goods are well rinsed in the\r\nwater and then passed into a vat which contains 1 lb. peroxide of sodium\r\nand 1 lb. sulphuric acid. This is started cold, after about fifteen\r\nminutes heat slowly to about 150°, work for twenty minutes, then lift,\r\nwash and dry. For subsequent lots of cotton there only need be used 7\r\nlb. Immedial blue C. 2 lb. sulphide of sodium, 3 lb. salt and 1-1/2 lb.\r\ncaustic soda lye at 70° Tw. The blue may also be developed by steaming\r\nwith air in a suitable chest or steaming chamber. By topping with 1/4\r\nlb. New methylene blue N, very bright blue shades can be dyed.\r\n\r\n_Dark Navy._--Prepare the dye-bath with 25 lb. Immedial blue C, 24 lb.\r\nsulphide of sodium, 35 lb. common salt and 12 lb. caustic soda lye,\r\nworking at the boil for one hour, then rinse and develop in a bath made\r\nfrom 2-1/2 lb. peroxide of sodium and 2-1/2 lb. sulphuric acid, started\r\ncold, then after twenty minutes heated to 160° F., twenty minutes longer\r\nat that heat will be sufficient. For second and subsequent lots of\r\ncotton there is added to the old bath 15 lb. Immedial blue C, 4 lb.\r\nsulphide of sodium, 5 lb. salt and 2 lb. caustic soda lye of 70° Tw.\r\n\r\n_Blue._--A pale but not very bright shade of blue is dyed in a bath of 3\r\nlb. Amidazol black 6 G, 5 lb. soda and 25 lb. salt. After working for\r\none hour at the boil, lift, rinse and pass into a bath which contains\r\n2-1/2 lb. peroxide of sodium and 2-1/2 lb. sulphuric acid; this is\r\nstarted cold, then heated to 150° F., and kept at that heat for twenty\r\nminutes, when the cotton is taken out, well washed and dried.\r\n\r\n_Deep Blue._--Dye with 20 lb. Amidazol black 6 G, 5 lb. soda and 200 lb.\r\nsalt; develop with 2 lb. peroxide of sodium and 2-1/2 lb. sulphuric\r\nacid, working as noted above.\r\n\r\n_Dark Drab._--Prepare the dye-bath with 20 lb. Cross-dye drab, 5 lb.\r\nsoda crystals and 80 lb. salt, work at the boil for an hour, then lift,\r\nwash well and dry; this can be chromed if desired.\r\n\r\n_Brown._--Dye with 20 lb. Amidazol cutch, 5 lb. soda ash and 150 lb.\r\nsalt, working at the boil for one hour, then lift, wash thoroughly and\r\ndry. By after treatment in a bath of 3 lb. potassium bichromate and 3\r\nlb. sulphuric acid the colour is made fast to washing. The shade is not\r\naltered.\r\n\r\n_Buff._--Dye with 2-1/2 lb. Amidazol cutch, 5 lb. soda and 25 lb. salt,\r\nworking at the boil for one hour, then lift, wash and dry.\r\n\r\n_Pale Sea Green._--Dye with 4 lb. Amidazol green Y, 5 lb. soda and 25\r\nlb. salt, working at the boil for one hour, then lift, wash well and\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n_Dark Green._--Dye with 20 lb. Amidazol green B, 5 lb. soda and 20 lb.\r\nsalt; work at the boil for one hour, then lift, wash thoroughly and dry.\r\n\r\n_Dark Brown._--Dye with 20 lb. Amidazol cachou, 5 lb. soda and 200 lb.\r\nsalt, working for an hour at the boil, then lift, rinse well and pass\r\ninto a chrome bath of 4 lb. potassium bichromate and 3 lb. sulphuric\r\nacid at 50° F. for half an hour, then wash well and dry.\r\n\r\n_Dark Sage._--Dye with 20 lb. Amidazol drab, 5 lb. soda ash and 150 lb.\r\nsalt for an hour at the boil, then lift and chrome with 4 lb. potassium\r\nbichromate and 8 lb. sulphuric acid for thirty minutes at 150° F.,\r\nwashing well afterwards.\r\n\r\nAll the Amidazol dyes are very fast to washing, acids, etc. They can be\r\ntreated with sulphate of copper or peroxide of sodium when they produce\r\ngood shades. They may even be diazotised and developed with\r\nbeta-naphthol and phenylene diamine. The pale tints got by using from 2\r\nto 4 per cent. of dye-stuff are useful ones, as also are the medium\r\nshades with 10 per cent. of dye-stuff.\r\n\r\n_Brown._--Prepare the dye-bath with 10 lb. Sulfaniline brown 4 B, 50 lb.\r\nsalt, 10 lb. soda and 5 lb sulphide of sodium; work at the boil for one\r\nhour, then lift, wash and treat in a fresh bath with 3 lb. potassium\r\nbichromate and 2 lb. acetic acid at 160° F. for half an hour, then wash\r\nwell and dry.\r\n\r\n_Olive._--Dye with 10 lb. Katigen olive G, 50 lb. salt, 10 lb. soda and\r\n6 lb. sulphide of sodium; work for one hour at the boil, then lift, wash\r\nand treat in a fresh bath with 2 lb. bichromate of potash, 2 lb.\r\nsulphate of copper and 2 lb. acetic acid for half an hour at the boil,\r\nthen wash.\r\n\r\n_Dark Olive._--Dye with 20 lb. Katigen olive G, 50 lb. salt, 10 lb.\r\nsoda, and 6 lb. sulphide of sodium, working at the boil for one hour,\r\nthen lift, wash and dry. By chroming a darker and faster olive is got.\r\n\r\n_Brown._--Dye with 20 lb. Katigen dark brown, 50 lb. salt, 10 lb. soda\r\nand 6 lb. sulphide of sodium at the boil for one hour, then treat in a\r\nfresh bath with 2 lb. bichromate of potash, 2 lb. sulphate of copper and\r\n2 lb. acetic acid for half an hour at the boil, then wash well.\r\n\r\n_Pale Brown._--Dye with 8 lb. Immedial bronze A, 2 lb. soda, 2 lb.\r\nsulphide of sodium and 10 lb. Glauber's salt at the boil for one hour,\r\nthen lift, rinse and pass into a fresh bath containing 1 lb. bichromate\r\nof potash and 2 lb. acetic-acid at 150° F. for half an hour, then lift,\r\nwash and dry.\r\n\r\n_Dark Brown._--Dye with 12 lb. Immedial brown B, 5 lb. sulphide of\r\nsodium, 5 lb. soda and 20 lb. salt at the boil for one hour, then lift\r\nand treat in a fresh bath with 2 lb. bichromate of potash, 2 lb.\r\nsulphate of copper and 2 lb. acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe Immedial blacks, blue, bronze and brown dye very fast shades,\r\nstanding soaping, acids and light. They may be combined together to\r\nproduce a great range of shades of blue, brown, green, grey, etc.\r\n\r\nThese examples will perhaps suffice to show how this new but important\r\nclass of sulphyl colours are applied to the dyeing of cotton. They may\r\nbe topped with aniline black, indigo, basic dyes, or combined with such\r\ndirect dyes as produce shades fast to chroming to form a very great\r\nrange of shades which have the merit of fastness.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) DIRECT DYEING FOLLOWED BY FIXATION WITH DEVELOPERS.\r\n\r\nA large number of the dyes prepared from coal tar are called azo\r\ncolours, such for instance are the Biebrich and Croceine scarlets and\r\noranges, Naphthol black, Congo red, etc., just to name a few. The\r\npreparation of these is about the simplest operation of colour\r\nchemistry, and consists in taking as the base an amido compound as the\r\nchemist calls such. These amido compounds, of which aniline, toluidine,\r\nbenzidine, naphthylamine are familiar examples, are characterised by\r\ncontaining the molecular group NH{2}, which radicle is built up of the\r\ntwo elements nitrogen and hydrogen. All compounds which contain this\r\ngroup are basic in character and combine with acids to form well-defined\r\nsalts. When these amido bodies are treated with sodium nitrite and\r\nhydrochloric acid they undergo a chemical change, the feature of which\r\nis that the nitrogen atoms present in the amido compound and in the\r\nnitrite unite together and a new compound is produced which is called a\r\ndiazo compound, and the operation is called \"diazotisation\".\r\n\r\nFor example when paranitroaniline is subjected to this reaction it\r\nundergoes a change indicated in the chemical equation:--\r\n\r\nC{6}H{4}NO{2}NH{2}, + NaNO{2}, + 2HCl = Paranitroaniline, Sodium\r\nnitrite, Hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nC{6}H{4}NO{2}N: NCl + NaCl + 2H{2}0 = Paranitro benzene Sodium\r\nchloride, Water, diazo chloride.\r\n\r\nThe above, put into words, means that when paranitroaniline is dissolved\r\nwith hydrochloric acid and treated with nitrite of soda it forms\r\ndiazonitro benzene chloride, sodium chloride and water. Now the diazo\r\ncompounds are rather unstable bodies, but they have a great affinity for\r\nother compounds, such as naphthol, phenylene diamine, phenol, and\r\ncombine easily with them when brought into contact with them. The new\r\ncompounds thus made form the dye-stuffs of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe azo dyes contain the characteristic group of two nitrogen atoms\r\nshown in the formula N: N. In dealing with the production of colours\r\ndirect on the fibre this subject will be elaborated more fully.\r\n\r\nNow many of the direct dyes, Diamine blacks, Diamine cutch, Primuline,\r\nDiazo brown, Zambesi blues, browns, etc., contain amido groups, by\r\nreason of having been made from such bodies as phenylene diamine, amido\r\nnaphthol, toluidine, etc., and it has been found that when dyed on the\r\nfibre they are capable of being diazotised by passing the dyed fibre\r\ninto a bath of sodium nitrite acidified with hydrochloric acid, and if\r\nthen they are placed into a bath containing such a body as\r\nbeta-naphthol, phenylene diamine, etc., new compounds or dyes are\r\nproduced, which are characterised by being insoluble in water, and\r\ntherefore as formed on the fibre in the manner indicated are very fast\r\nto washing, soaping and similar agencies.\r\n\r\nOften the new or developed dye formed on the fibre differs markedly in\r\ncolour from the original dye. Perhaps in no case is this more strongly\r\nshown than with Primuline. The original colour is a greenish yellow, but\r\nby using various developers, as they are called, a great variety of\r\nshade can be got, as shown in this table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Developer._                        _Colour produced._\r\n\r\nBeta-naphthol                            Bright scarlet.\r\nAlpha-naphthol                           Crimson.\r\nPhenylene diamine                        Brown.\r\nPhenol                                   Gold yellow.\r\nResorcine                                Orange.\r\nNaphthylamine ether                      Blue.\r\nBlue developer A N                       Green.\r\n\r\nAs regards the dyeing operation, it no way differs from that described\r\nfor simple direct colours. It should, however, be noted that if good\r\nresults are required full shades must be dyed. The cotton must be\r\nrinsed in cold water, and be quite cold before it is subjected to the\r\ndiazotising operation. _Diazotising_ is a simple operation, yet it must\r\nbe carried out with care if good results are desired. It consists\r\nessentially in the use of an acidulated bath of sodium nitrite.\r\n\r\nTo make the bath for diazotising there is taken (for each 100 lb. of\r\ngoods) sufficient water to handle them in comfortably, 8 lb. of sodium\r\nnitrite and 6 lb. hydrochloric acid. This bath must be quite cold\r\notherwise it does not work well. The goods are handled in this for from\r\nfifteen to twenty minutes, when they are ready for the next operation.\r\nThe bath is not exhausted of nitrite, etc., hence it can be kept\r\nstanding, and for each succeeding lot of cotton it is strengthened up by\r\nadding one-third of the quantities of nitrite and acid originally used.\r\nOf course the bath cannot be kept for ever, sooner or later it will get\r\ndirty, and then it must be thrown away and a new bath be made up.\r\n\r\nThe diazo compounds formed on the fibre are not very stable bodies. They\r\ndecompose on being exposed for any great length of time to the air,\r\nwhile light has a strong action on most, if not all of them; hence it\r\nfollows that the diazotising process should not be carried out in a room\r\nwhere direct, strong sunlight can enter or fall upon the goods. Then\r\nagain, after diazotising, the treated goods should not be allowed to lie\r\nabout exposed to air and light, but the operation of developing should\r\nbe proceeded with at once, otherwise the diazo body will decompose, and\r\nweak and defective colours are liable to be obtained on subsequent\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nFor _developing_, quite a large number of substances are used. Some of\r\nthese are regular articles of commerce, others are the special\r\nproductions of certain firms, who advise their use with the dyes that\r\nthey also manufacture. These latter are sent out under such designations\r\nas Developer B, Developer A N, or Fast-blue developer. Those most in use\r\nare beta-naphthol for red from Primuline, and for bluish blacks from\r\nDiamine blacks, Diazo blacks, Zambesi blacks, etc.; for dark blues from\r\nDiamine blues, Diazo blues, etc.; for greys from Diamine blues, Neutral\r\ngrey, etc. Alpha-naphthol for dark reds from Primuline, greys from\r\nDiamine blues, Neutral grey, etc. Phenylene diamine for blacks from\r\nDiamine blacks, Diazo blacks, Zambesi blacks, Triamine blacks, etc.; for\r\ndark browns from Diamine browns, Diazo browns, etc.; for light browns\r\nfrom Cotton browns, Diamine cutch, Primuline, etc. Naphthylamine ether\r\nfor blues from Diamine blacks, etc. Phenol for claret from Diamine\r\ncutch, and for gold yellow from Primuline, etc. Resorcine for orange\r\nfrom Primuline, etc. Soda for browns from Diamine cutch, Diazo browns,\r\nZambesi browns, for orange from Diamine orange, and yellow from\r\nPrimuline.\r\n\r\n=Beta-naphthol.=--This is by far the most important of the developers.\r\nIt is a white body, insoluble in water, but readily soluble in soda lye,\r\nand a solution is easily made by taking 10 lb. beta-naphthol and heating\r\nit with 10 lb. caustic soda lye of 70° Tw. and 60 gallons of water. This\r\nbath may be used as the developing bath, or it may be diluted with more\r\nwater. It is not desirable to use any more caustic soda than is\r\nnecessary to dissolve the beta-naphthol, so that the bath is not too\r\nalkaline. To produce full shades it usually takes 1 per cent. of the\r\nweight of the cotton of the beta-naphthol, but it is best to use the\r\nbath as a continuous one and for the first lot of cotton use 2 per cent.\r\nof naphthol, while for each succeeding lot only 1 per cent. more\r\nnaphthol need be added to the same bath.\r\n\r\nThis bath is alkaline, while the diazotising bath is acid, unless,\r\ntherefore, the cotton be well washed when it is taken from the latter\r\nbath there is a risk of the alkali of the one being neutralised by the\r\nacidity of the other, and the naphthol being thrown out in an insoluble\r\nform. This, of course, is easily remedied should it occur.\r\n\r\nDeveloper A (Bayer) is a mixture of beta-naphthol and caustic soda in\r\nthe powder form, so that a solution is obtained by simply adding water.\r\nRather more (about 1-1/2 per cent.) of this is required than of\r\nbeta-naphthol.\r\n\r\n=Alpha-naphthol= has similar properties to, and is used in the same way\r\nas, beta-naphthol; it develops much darker and rather duller colours,\r\nwhich are less fast to washing.\r\n\r\n=Resorcine=, like naphthol, is insoluble in water, but it can be\r\ndissolved by using either soda ash or caustic soda. The latter is\r\npreferable, as the former is liable to give a developing bath that\r\nfroths in working, especially if much acid has been left in the cotton\r\nfrom the diazotising bath. The proportions are: 10 lb. resorcine, 25 lb.\r\ncaustic soda lye of 70° Tw., and 60 gallons of water; or 10 lb.\r\nresorcine, 20 lb. soda ash, and 60 gallons of water, heated until a\r\nsolution is obtained. In the developing bath 1 per cent. of resorcine is\r\nusually sufficient to use. It develops an orange with Primuline.\r\n\r\nDeveloper F (Bayer) is a mixture of resorcine and soda ash. It requires\r\n1-1/2 per cent, to make a developing bath.\r\n\r\n=Phenol=, better known as carbolic acid, finds a use as a developer. It\r\nis dissolved in caustic soda, 10 lb. phenol, 15 lb. caustic soda lye of\r\n70° Tw., and 60 gallons of water. Generally 1 per cent. is sufficient to\r\nuse as a developer. It is often called yellow developer.\r\n\r\n=Naphthylamine ether= is used as a developer for blues in conjunction\r\nwith the Diamine blacks. It is prepared for use by dissolving in\r\nhydrochloric acid, 10 lb. naphthylamine ether powder heated with 5 lb.\r\nhydrochloric acid and 50 gallons water. About 1-1/4 per cent. is\r\nrequired to form a developing bath. Naphthylamine ether is also sent out\r\nin the form of a paste mixed with acid, and containing about 25 per\r\ncent. of the actual developer.\r\n\r\n=Fast blue developer A D= (Cassella), is amidodiphenylamine. It is\r\ninsoluble in water, but soluble in dilute acid, 10 lb. fast blue\r\ndeveloper A D, 5 lb. hydrochloric acid and 35 gallons of water making\r\nthe bath. To develop full shades 1 to 1-1/2 per cent, is required.\r\n\r\n=Blue developer A N= (Cassella). The base of this is insoluble in water,\r\nbut dissolves in soda, and is probably a naphthol-sulpho acid. The\r\nproduct, as met with in the market, is soluble in water, and 27 lb.\r\ndissolved in 20 gallons of water form the bath. To produce full shades\r\n1-1/2 per cent, is usually required.\r\n\r\n=Phenylene diamine= is a most important developer. It comes into the\r\nmarket in two forms, as a powder, very nearly pure, made into a solution\r\nby dissolving 10 lb. with 20 gallons of water and 5 lb. hydrochloric\r\nacid, and as a solution prepared ready for use. Developer C (Bayer) and\r\ndeveloper E (Bayer) are preparations of diamine, the former in a powder,\r\nthe latter in a solution. Phenylene diamine can be used with the\r\naddition to the developing bath of acetic acid or soda.\r\n\r\n=Schaeffer's acid= is a sulpho acid of beta-naphthol, and is dissolved\r\nby taking 10 lb. of the acid and 7-1/2 lb. soda, boiling with 50 gallons\r\nof water. About 1-1/4 per cent. is required for developing full shades.\r\n\r\nDeveloper B (Bayer) is ethyl beta-naphthylamine, in the form of its\r\nhydrochloric acid compound. The bath is made from 10 lb. of the\r\ndeveloper and 50 gallons of water, 1-1/4 per cent. being used to obtain\r\nfull shades.\r\n\r\nDeveloper D (Bayer) is dioxy-naphthalene-sulpho acid, and simply\r\nrequires dissolving in water to make the bath.\r\n\r\n=Toluylene diamine= is a homologue of phenylene diamine and is used in\r\nprecisely the same way.\r\n\r\nGenerally the special developers issued by the various colour firms\r\nsimply require dissolving in water to form the developing bath.\r\n\r\nThe cotton, previously being passed through the diazotising bath, is\r\nthen run into the developing bath, in which it is kept for from twenty\r\nto thirty minutes or until the required shade is fully developed, after\r\nwhich it is taken out, rinsed and dried. The method of working is the\r\nsame for all the developers, and may be carried out in any kind of\r\nvessels. As is indicated above, the developing baths may be kept\r\nstanding and be freshened up as required; they are used cold. Sometimes\r\ntwo developers are mixed together, in which case care should be taken\r\nthat an alkaline developer naphthol or phenol be not mixed with an acid\r\ndeveloper (phenylene diamine, naphthylamine, etc.), unless the acidity\r\nof the latter has been neutralised with soda; otherwise the developer\r\nmight be thrown out of the bath in an insoluble and hence useless form.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the diazotising and developing process just described\r\nmay be summed as--easy and quick working, superior fastness to washing,\r\nsoaping and milling, increased fastness to light and softness of the\r\ndyed fibre.\r\n\r\n_Scarlet._--Dye with 3 lb.

For subsequent\r\nlots in the same bath one-third of these additions is sufficient.

It may also be added that many\r\nof the direct dyes, although not diazotisable, are not altered by the\r\nprocess and so may be used along with diazotisable dyes for the purpose\r\nof shading them, and in that way a great range of shades can be\r\nproduced, particularly by combining Primuline with other dyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) DIRECT DYEING FOLLOWED BY FIXATION WITH COUPLERS.\r\n\r\nA further development in the application of the direct dyes has of late\r\nyears been made. This is a two-bath method. The cotton is dyed with\r\ncertain of the direct dyes: Primuline, Diamine jet blacks, Diazo blacks,\r\nToluylene orange and brown, Diazo brown, Diamine nitrazol dyes, Benzo\r\nnitrol dyes, etc., in the usual way. Then a bath is prepared by\r\ndiazotising paranitroaniline, benzidine, metanitraniline, dianisidine,\r\netc., or by using the ready diazotised preparations which are now on the\r\nmarket, Nitrazol C, Azophor red P N, Azophor blue P N, etc., and\r\nimmersing the dyed cotton in this bath. Combination takes place between\r\nthe dye on the fibre and the diazo compound in this bath, and a new\r\nproduct is produced direct on the fibre, which being insoluble is very\r\nresistant to washing and soaping. These \"coupled\" shades, as they will\r\nprobably come to be called, differ from those produced on the fibre by\r\nthe original dye-stuff, thus the Diamine jet blacks and some of the\r\nDiazo blacks give, with paranitroaniline, browns of various shades.\r\n\r\nIn this section also may be considered the method of dyeing cotton by\r\nusing the direct colours in the ordinary way, and then \"topping,\" as it\r\nis called, with a basic dye in a fresh bath.\r\n\r\nPractically in the \"coupling process\" of dyeing only diazotised\r\nparanitroaniline is used as the coupler, although other amido bases of a\r\nsimilar nature are available.\r\n\r\nWhen paranitroaniline is used as the source for the coupling bath it is\r\nwell to prepare a stock bath of diazotised paranitroaniline, which may\r\nbe done in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n=Preparation of diazotised paranitroaniline.=--Take 1 lb.\r\nparanitroaniline, mix with 1 gallon boiling water and 1 quart\r\nhydrochloric acid, stir well, when the paranitroaniline will dissolve\r\nthe solution may if necessary be assisted by a little heat. Now add\r\n1-1/2 gallons of cold water, and set aside to cool, when the\r\nhydrochloride of paranitroaniline will separate out in the form of fine\r\ncrystals; when the mixture is quite cold (it cannot be too cold) there\r\nis added 1/2 lb. sodium nitrite dissolved in 1/2 gallon cold water, stir\r\nwell for fifteen to twenty minutes, by the end of which time the\r\nparanitroaniline will have become fully diazotised, cold water is added\r\nto bring up the volume of the mixture to 10 gallons. This stock bath\r\nwell prepared and kept in a cool, dark place will keep good for three to\r\nfour weeks. This bath contains 1 lb. of paranitroaniline in 10 gallons,\r\nand it is a good rule to allow 1/2 lb., or 5 gallons of this stock bath\r\nto each pound of dye-stuff used in dyeing the ground colour to be\r\ndeveloped up.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the coupling bath there is taken 5 gallons of the stock bath,\r\n1 lb. sodium acetate with sufficient water for each 1 lb. of dye that\r\nhas been used.\r\n\r\nThis bath is used cold, and the cotton is worked in it for half an hour,\r\nthen it is taken out, washed well and dried.\r\n\r\nNitrazol C is a ready prepared diazotised paranitroaniline in a powder\r\nform which keeps well if stored in a dry place. The method of using is\r\nto take 8 lb. Nitrazol C, stir into a paste with water and then add this\r\npaste to the coupling bath, together with 2 lb. soda and 3/4 lb. acetate\r\nof soda. This bath is used cold and the dyed cotton is immersed in it\r\nfor half an hour, then taken out, well washed and dried.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of Nitrazol C given will suffice for all shades dyed with\r\nfrom 2 to 4 per cent, of dye-stuff, but when paler shades are dyed,\r\nusing less than say 1/2 per cent. of dye-stuff, about 4 lb. Nitrazol C,\r\nwith the soda and acetate of soda in proportionate quantities, may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nAzophor red P N is also a preparation of diazotised paranitroaniline in\r\nthe form of a dry powder which keeps well.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the coupling bath there is taken 2 lb. of Azophor red P N,\r\nwhich is dissolved in water and added to the bath along with 1 lb.\r\nacetate of soda. The dyed goods are worked in the cold bath for half an\r\nhour, then taken out, well washed and dried.\r\n\r\nThe quantities given are sufficient for shades dyed with 2 to 4 per\r\ncent. of dye-stuff; for weaker shades half the quantities may be taken.\r\n\r\nBenzo-nitrol developer is sold in the form of a yellow paste. To use it\r\ntake 5 lb., stir into a smooth paste with water, then add to the\r\ncoupling bath. There is then added 3 pints of hydrochloric acid, with\r\nsome stirring. Allow to stand for half an hour, add 1-1/2 lb. acetate of\r\nsoda and 6-1/2 oz. soda, when the bath is ready for use. The cotton is\r\nentered and worked for half an hour, then lifted out, washed and dried.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that solutions of the three couplers just named may\r\nbe kept for some time without decomposition, but as soon as soda and\r\nacetate of soda are added they begin to decompose and then cannot be\r\nkept more than a few hours in a good condition. It is a good plan\r\ntherefore not to add the acetate of soda until the bath is to be used.\r\n\r\nAn excess of coupler in the bath does no harm, but a deficiency may lead\r\nto poor and weak shades being developed.\r\n\r\nThe following recipes show the dyes which may be applied by this method\r\nand give some idea of the colours that can be got. Only the dye-stuffs\r\nare given. Any of the above couplers can be used with them as may be\r\nmost convenient.\r\n\r\n_Black._--Dye with 5 lb.

For a long time these dyes were only used for dyeing\r\nwool and silk; for cotton, linen, and some other vegetable fibres they\r\nhave little or no affinity, and hence cannot dye them direct. However,\r\nit was found out that if the cotton be prepared or mordanted (as it is\r\ncalled) with tannic acid or with any substance containing that compound\r\nthey could be used for dyeing cotton.\r\n\r\nThe mordant used, tannic acid, has the property of combining with the\r\ndyes of this group to form insoluble coloured tannates. Now tannic acid\r\nhas a certain amount of affinity for cotton, if the latter be immersed\r\nin solution of tannic acid or any material containing it some of the\r\nlatter is taken up and more or less fixed by the cotton fibre. Tannic\r\nacid is a vegetable product found in a large number of plants, and plant\r\nproducts, such as sumac, myrabolams, divi-divi, galls, oak bark,\r\ngambier, cutch, algarobilla, valonia, etc., which are commonly known as\r\ntannins, or tannin matters, on account of their use in the conversion of\r\nanimal skins or hides into leather, which is done in the tanning\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nBy itself the tannin-colour lake, which may be formed on the cotton\r\nfibre by immersion first in a bath of tannin and then in a dye-bath, is\r\nnot fast to washing and soaping, but by taking advantage of the fact\r\nwith such metals as tin, iron, antimony, etc., it combines to form\r\ninsoluble tannates; the tannic acid can be fixed on the cotton by\r\nimmersion in a bath containing such fixing salts as tartar emetic, tin\r\ncrystals, copperas, antimony fluoride, and antimony oxalate. The dyeing\r\nof cotton with the basic colours therefore resolves itself into three\r\noperations:--\r\n\r\n(1) Tanning with tannic acid or some tanning matters.\r\n(2) Fixation with tartar emetic or other fixing agent.\r\n(3) Dyeing with the required colour or mixture of colours.\r\n\r\n(1) =The Tanning Operation.=--The practice of tanning or mordanting\r\ncotton with tannin is variously carried on by dyers. Some steep the\r\ncotton in the tannin bath over night, others immerse it from two to\r\nthree hours in a lukewarm bath, while some enter it in a boiling bath,\r\nwhich is then allowed to cool down and the cotton is lifted out. The\r\nlast is perhaps the quickest method, and experiments have shown that it\r\nis as good as any other method, if the quantity of tannic acid taken up\r\nbe regarded as the criterion of success.\r\n\r\nIn the natural products which have just been enumerated, the tannic acid\r\nis accompanied by some colouring matter, which is also absorbed by the\r\ncotton; in some (sumac and galls) this colour is present in but small\r\nquantities; in others (divi-divi, myrabolams, algarobilla), there is a\r\nlarge quantity; therefore cotton treated with these comes out more or\r\nless coloured. Now it is obvious that such forms of tannin cannot be\r\nused when light tints are to be dyed, for such the acid itself must be\r\nused, for medium shades sumac or galls may be used; while when dark\r\nshades--browns, maroons, dark greens, navy blues, etc., are to be dyed,\r\nthen such tannin matters as divi-divi or myrabolams may be conveniently\r\nand economically adopted. The quantity used varies according to\r\ncircumstances; the character of the shades that are to be dyed, the\r\ndye-stuff used, the quality and character of the tannin matter used. For\r\npale shades about 1 per cent. of tannic acid may be used, deep shades\r\nrequire from 3 to 4 per cent. Of tannin matters from 5 per cent. may be\r\nused for pale shades, from 20 to 25 per cent. for deep shades. The\r\ntannin baths are not exhausted, and may be kept standing, adding for\r\neach succeeding lot of cotton from 1/2 to 3/4 of the above quantities of\r\ntannin matters. Of course sooner or later the baths become unusable from\r\nvarious causes, and then they may be thrown away; but old tannin baths\r\noften work better than the new ones.\r\n\r\n(2) =The Fixing Bath.=--Following on the tannin bath comes the fixing\r\nbath to fix the tannin on the cotton in the form of insoluble metallic\r\ntannates. A variety of metallic salts may be used for this purpose,\r\nthose of antimony, tin, iron, lead, etc., the substances most commonly\r\nused being tartar emetic, antimony fluoride, oxalate of antimony, tin\r\ncrystals and copperas.\r\n\r\nBeyond forming the insoluble tannate of antimony or tin, as the case may\r\nbe, the salts of antimony and tin have no further effect on the tanned\r\ncotton, and they may be used to fix the tannin for all tints or shades,\r\nfrom very pale to very deep. Of all these salts tartar emetic has been\r\nfound to be the best, probably because it is the least acid in its\r\nreactions, and therefore there is no tendency to remove any tannin from\r\nthe fibre, as is the case with the other salts. Tin salt is little used\r\nfor this purpose, because of its acidity, which prevents it from fixing\r\nthe tannin as completely as is the case with tartar emetic.\r\n\r\nWith copperas or iron liquor the question comes up not only of the mere\r\nfixation of the tannin, but also the fact that iron forms with tannin\r\ngrey to black compounds, hence cotton which has been tanned and then\r\nimmersed in a bath of copperas becomes coloured grey to black, according\r\nto the quantity of the tannin matter used. The property is useful when\r\ndark shades of maroons, clarets, greens, browns, blues, etc., are to be\r\ndyed, and is frequently employed.\r\n\r\n(3) =Dyeing.=--After the tannin and fixing operations comes the dyeing.\r\nThis is not by any means a difficult operation. It is best carried out\r\nby preparing a cold bath, entering the prepared or mordanted cotton in\r\nthis and heating slowly up. It is not necessary to raise to the boil nor\r\nto maintain the dye-bath at that heat, a temperature of 180° F. being\r\nquite sufficient in dyeing with the basic colours, and the operation\r\nshould last only until the colouring matter is extracted from the\r\ndye-bath. Working in this way, level uniform shades can be got.\r\n\r\nOne source of trouble in the dyeing of basic dyes, more especially with\r\nmagentas, violets and greens, lies in their slight solubility and great\r\nstrength. In preparing solutions of such dyes it is best to dissolve the\r\ndye-stuff by pouring boiling water over it, and stirring well until all\r\nappears to be dissolved.\r\n\r\nThis solution should be strained through a fine cloth, as any\r\nundissolved specks will be sure to fix themselves on the cloth and lead\r\nto dark spots and stains, as, owing to the weak solubility of the dye,\r\nand this being also fixed as insoluble tannate by the tannic acid on the\r\nfibre, there is no tendency for the dye to diffuse itself over the\r\ncloth, as occasionally happens in other methods of dyeing. No advantage\r\nis gained by adding to the dye-bath such substances as common salt or\r\nGlauber's salt.\r\n\r\nSome few of the dyes, _e.g._, Soluble blue, Victoria blue, which will\r\ndye on a tannic mordant, are sulphonated compounds of the colour base.\r\nThese can be dyed in medium or light shades on to unmordanted cotton\r\nfrom a bath containing alum, and in the ordinary method of dyeing the\r\naddition of alum is beneficial, as tending to result in the production\r\nof deep shades. These are somewhat faster to washing and soaping, which\r\nis owing to the dye-stuff combining with the alumina in the alum to form\r\nan insoluble colour lake of the sulphuric acid groups it contains.\r\n\r\nMany recipes can be given for the dyeing of basic dyes on cotton; for\r\nthe range of tints and shades of all colours that can be produced by\r\ntheir means is truly great. Typical recipes will be given showing what\r\nbasic dyes are available and how they can be combined together. The\r\ndyer, however, who knows how to produce shades by combining one\r\ndye-stuff with another is able to get many more shades than space will\r\npermit to be given here.\r\n\r\n_Sky Blue._--Mordant with 1 lb. tannic acid and 1/2 lb. tartar emetic,\r\nthen dye with 2-1/2 oz.

Safranine S.\r\n\r\nThe Janus colours are a series of dyes of a basic nature which can be\r\napplied somewhat differently to the ordinary basic dyes, although the\r\nordinary method can be followed. With these Janus dyes a two-bath\r\nprocess is followed. A dye-bath is prepared containing the dye-stuff,\r\nsulphuric acid and common salt, and this is used at the boil from half\r\nto three-quarters of an hour, and the goods are allowed to remain in\r\nanother three-quarters of an hour while the bath cools down. Next the\r\ndyed goods are run in a fixing bath of sulphuric acid, tannic acid and\r\ntartar emetic, this is used at the boil from half to one hour, after\r\nwhich the dyed goods are taken out and washed. If necessary the goods\r\nmay be now topped with basic colours in order to produce any desired\r\nshade. The following recipes will show how the Janus dyes may be used:--\r\n\r\n_Blue._--Dye with 9 oz. sulphuric acid, 8 oz. Janus blue G, and 5 lb.\r\ncommon salt; fix with 3/4 lb. sulphuric acid, 8 oz. tannic acid and 4\r\noz. tartar emetic.\r\n\r\n_Turquoise Blue._--Dye with 9 oz. sulphuric acid, 1 lb.

They\r\nhave the property of combining with metallic oxides such as those of\r\niron, chromium, aluminium, tin, lead, calcium, etc., to form coloured\r\nbodies which are more or less insoluble in water. These coloured bodies\r\nare called \"colour lakes,\" and the metallic compounds used in connection\r\nwith their production \"mordants,\" hence often the dye-stuffs applied by\r\nthis method are termed \"mordant dyes\". In the case of the natural\r\ndye-stuffs--logwood, fustic, Persian berries, Brazil wood, camwood,\r\ncochineal, quercitron, cutch, etc.--which belong to this group of\r\n\"mordant dyes,\" the whole of the material does not enter into the\r\noperation, but only a certain constituent contained therein, which is\r\ncommonly soluble in boiling water, and extracted out by boiling. This\r\nconstituent is called the \"colouring principle\" of the dye-stuff or\r\nwood, and naturally varies with each. It is not intended here to deal\r\nin detail with these colouring principles. The methods of applying and\r\nthe colours which can be got from these dyes varies very much. Roughly,\r\nthe modes of application fall under three heads: (1) the particular\r\nmetallic mordant is first fixed on the fibre by any suitable method, and\r\nthen the fibre is dyed; (2) the dye-stuff is first applied to the fibre,\r\nand then the colour is fixed and developed by treatment with the\r\nmordant; and (3) the dye-stuff and the mordant are applied at the same\r\ntime. This last method is not much used. In the following sections many\r\nexamples of these methods will be given.\r\n\r\nThe dyes fixed with metallic mordant vary in their composition and\r\nproperties. There is first the group of eosine dyes, which are acid\r\nderivatives of a colour-base, and, in virtue of being so, will combine\r\nwith the metallic oxides. The colour of these colour lakes is quite\r\nindependent of what oxide is used, depending only on that of the\r\nparticular eosine dye employed. Then there are some members of the azo\r\ndyes, particularly the croceine scarlets, which can also be dyed on the\r\ncotton by the aid of tin, lead or alum mordants. Here, again, the\r\nmordant has no influence on the colour, but only fixes it on the cotton.\r\n\r\nThe most important class of dye-stuffs which are dyed on to cotton with\r\na metallic mordant is that to which the term \"mordant dyes\" is now\r\ngiven. This includes such dyes as logwood, fustic, madder, alizarine,\r\nand all the dyes derived from anthracene. Many of these are not really\r\ndyes, that is, they will not of themselves produce or develop a colour\r\non to any fibre when used alone; it is only when they combine with the\r\nmordant oxide which is used, and then the colour varies with the\r\nmordant. Thus, for instance, logwood with iron produces a bluish black;\r\nwith chrome, a blue; with alumina, a reddish blue. Alizarine with iron\r\nproduces a dark violet; with alumina, a scarlet; with chrome, a red;\r\nwith tin, a bright scarlet. Fustic gives with tin and alumina, bright\r\nyellows; with chrome, a dark yellow; with iron, an olive, and so on with\r\nother members of this group, of which more will be said later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dyeing with Eosines._\r\n\r\nAt one time a fairly large quantity of cotton was dyed with the eosines,\r\nowing to the brightness of the shades given by them; but the\r\nintroduction of such direct dyes as the Erikas, Ceranines, etc., has\r\nthrown the eosines out of use.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted for the production of eosine pinks and scarlets on\r\ncotton involves three operations: (1) impregnating the cloth with sodium\r\nstannate; (2) fixing oxide of tin by a bath of weak sulphuric acid; and\r\n(3) dyeing with the eosine.\r\n\r\n=(1) Preparing with Sodium Stannate.=--A bath of 8° Tw. is prepared, and\r\nthe cotton is allowed to steep in this bath until it becomes thoroughly\r\nimpregnated, after which it is taken out and wrung.\r\n\r\n=(2) Fixing the Tin Oxide.=--A bath of sulphuric acid of 2° to 4° Tw. is\r\nprepared, and the cotton is sent through it, after which it is washed\r\nwell with water, when it is ready for dyeing.\r\n\r\nStannate of soda is easily decomposed by acids; even the carbonic acid\r\npresent in the air will bring about this change. The tin contained in\r\nthe stannate is deposited on the cotton in the form of stannic oxide,\r\nor, more strictly, stannic acid. As this is somewhat soluble in acids,\r\nit is important that the sulphuric acid bath be not too strong, or there\r\nwill be a tendency for the tin oxide to be dissolved off the cotton, and\r\nthen but weak shades will be obtained in the final operation of dyeing.\r\nFurther, owing to the decomposition of the stannate by exposure to the\r\nair, it is important that the substance should be used while fresh, and\r\nthat only fresh baths should be used.\r\n\r\n=(3) Dyeing with Eosine Colours.=--After the treatment with stannate of\r\nsoda and sulphuric acid the prepared cotton is ready for dyeing. This\r\nprocess is carried out by preparing a cold bath with the required\r\ndye-stuff, entering the cotton therein, and then slowly raising to about\r\n180° F., and maintaining at that heat until the desired shade is\r\nobtained. It is not needful to raise to the boil and work at that heat.\r\nNo better results are obtained, while there is even a tendency for\r\ncolours to be produced that rub badly, which is due to the too rapid\r\nformation of the colour lake; and it is worthy of note that when a\r\ncolour lake is rapidly formed on the fibre in dyeing it is apt to be but\r\nloosely fixed, and the colour is then loose to both washing and rubbing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Dyeing with Acid and Azo Dyes._\r\n\r\nIn dyeing with this class of colours stannate of soda, acetate of lead\r\nor alum may be used as mordants. The stannate of soda is employed in the\r\nsame manner as when the eosines are used, and, therefore, does not\r\nrequire to be further dealt with.\r\n\r\nAcetate of lead is used in a similar way. The cotton is first steeped in\r\na bath of acetate of lead of about 10° Tw. strong, used cold, and from\r\nhalf an hour to an hour is allowed for the cotton to be thoroughly\r\nimpregnated with the lead solution, it is then wrung and passed a second\r\ntime into a bath of soda, when lead oxide or lead carbonate is deposited\r\non the cotton. After this treatment the cotton is ready for dyeing with\r\nany kind of acid, azo and even eosine dyes, and this is done in the same\r\nmanner as is used in dyeing the eosines on a stannate mordant. The\r\nshades obtained on a lead mordant cannot be considered as fast; they\r\nbleed on washing and rub off badly.\r\n\r\nWhen alum is used as the mordant it may be employed in the same way as\r\nacetate of lead, but as a rule it is added to the dye-bath direct, and\r\nthe dyeing is done at the boil. This latter method gives equally good\r\nresults, and is more simple.\r\n\r\nThe eosines and erythrosines, water blues, soluble blues, croceine\r\nscarlets, cloth scarlets, and a few other dyes of the azo and acid\r\nseries are used according to this method. The results are by no means\r\nfirst class, deep shades cannot be obtained, and they are not fast to\r\nwashing, soaping and rubbing.\r\n\r\nThe methods of employing the much more important group of colouring\r\nmatters known as the mordant dyes, which comprise such well-known\r\nproducts as logwood, fustic and alizarine, require more attention. With\r\nthese, alumina, iron, and chromium mordants are used as chief mordants,\r\neither alone or in combination with one another, and with other bodies.\r\nThe principal point is to obtain a good deposit of the mordant on the\r\ncotton fibre, and this is by no means easy.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods by the use of which a deposit is formed of the\r\nmordant, either in the form of metallic oxide (or, perhaps, hydroxide)\r\nor of a basic salt. In some cases the cotton is passed through alternate\r\nbaths containing, on one hand, the mordanting salt, _e.g._, alum,\r\ncopperas, etc., and, on the other, a fixing agent, such as soda or\r\nphosphate of soda. Or a mordanting salt may be used, containing some\r\nvolatile acid that on being subjected to a subsequent steaming is\r\ndecomposed. Both these methods will be briefly discussed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Methods of Mordanting._\r\n\r\nThe cotton is first steeped in a bath containing Turkey-red oil, and is\r\nthen dried. By this means there is formed on the fibre a deposit of\r\nfatty acid, which is of great value in the subsequent dyeing operations\r\nto produce bright and fast shades. After the oiling comes a bath of alum\r\nor alumina sulphate, either used as bought, or made basic by the\r\naddition of soda. The result is to bring about on the fibre a\r\ncombination of the fatty acid with the alumina. Following on the alum\r\nbath comes a bath containing soda or phosphate of soda, which brings\r\nabout a better fixation of the alumina.\r\n\r\nThese operations may be repeated several times, especially when a full\r\nshade having a good degree of fastness is desired, as, for instance,\r\nTurkey-reds from Alizarine. This method of mordanting is subject to\r\nconsiderable variations as regards the order in which the various\r\noperations are carried out, the strength of the baths, and their\r\ncomposition. A great deal depends upon the ultimate result desired to be\r\nobtained, and the price to be paid for the work.\r\n\r\nIron is much easier to fix on cotton than is either alumina or chrome.\r\nIt is usually sufficient to pass the cotton through a bath of either\r\ncopperas or iron liquor, hang up to dry or age, and then pass into a\r\nbath of lime, soda or even phosphate of soda. The other mordants require\r\ntwo passages to ensure proper deposition of the mordant on the fibre.\r\n\r\nFollowing on the mordanting operations comes the dyeing, which is\r\ncarried out in the following manner. The bath is made cold with the\r\nrequired amount of dye-stuff and not too small a quantity of water, the\r\ncotton is immersed and worked for a short time to ensure impregnation,\r\nthen the temperature is slowly raised to the boil. This operation should\r\nbe carefully carried out, inasmuch as time is an important element in\r\nthe dyeing with mordant colours; the colouring principle contained in\r\nthe dye-stuff must enter into a chemical combination with the mordant\r\nthat has been fixed on the fibre. Heat greatly assists this being\r\nbrought about, but if the operation is carried on too quickly, then\r\nthere is a tendency for uneven shades to be formed. This can only be\r\nremedied by keeping the temperature low until the dye-stuff has been\r\nfairly well united with the mordant, and then maintaining the heat at\r\nthe boil to ensure complete formation of the colouring lake on the\r\nfibre, and therefore the production of fast colours.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed in the dyeing of alizarines on both cotton and wool\r\nthat when, owing to a variety of circumstances, local overheating of the\r\nbath happens to take place dark strains or streaks are sure to be\r\nformed. To avoid these care should be taken that no such local heating\r\ncan occur.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to add that it is possible to dye a great range of\r\nshades by this method, reds with alizarine and alumina; blacks with\r\nlogwood and iron; greens from logwood, fustic, or Persian berries, with\r\nchrome and iron; blues from alizarine blues; greens from Coeruleine or\r\nDinitrosoresorcine, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother method of mordanting cotton for the mordant group of dye-stuffs\r\nis that in which the cotton is impregnated with a salt of the mordant\r\noxide derived from a volatile acid such as acetic acid, and then\r\nsubjected to heat or steaming. This method is largely taken advantage of\r\nby calico printers for grounds, and dyers might make use of it to a much\r\nlarger extent than they do.\r\n\r\nThere are used in this process the acetates of iron, chromium and\r\naluminium, and bisulphites of the same metals and a few other compounds.\r\nBaths of these are prepared, and the cotton is impregnated by steeping\r\nin the usual way; then it is gently wrung out and aged, that is, hung up\r\nin a warm room overnight. During this time the mordant penetrates more\r\nthoroughly into the substance of the fabric, while the acid, being more\r\nor less volatile, passes off--probably not entirely, but at any rate\r\nsome of the metal is left in the condition of oxide and the bulk of it\r\nas a basic salt. Instead of ageing the cotton may be subjected to a\r\nprocess of steaming with the same results. After this the cotton is\r\nready for dyeing, which is done by the method described in the last\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThere is still another method to be noticed here, that is, one in which\r\na bath is prepared containing both the mordant and the dye-stuff. In\r\nthis case the character of the mordant must be such that, under the\r\nconditions that prevail, it will not form a colour lake with the\r\ndye-stuff. Such substances are the bisulphites, if used with the\r\nbisulphite compounds of the dye-stuffs; the acetates, if mixed with some\r\nacetic acid, may also be used. The process consists in preparing the\r\ndye-bath containing both the mordant and the dye-stuff, entering the\r\ncotton, steeping for some time, then wringing and steaming. During the\r\nlatter operation the acid combined with the mordant, being volatile,\r\npasses away, and the colouring matter and mordant enter into combination\r\nto form the colour lake, which is firmly fixed upon the fibre. Very good\r\nresults may be obtained by this method.\r\n\r\nLastly, in connection with the mordant colours, attention may be\r\ndirected to the process of using some of them, which consists in making\r\na solution of the dye-stuff in ammonia, impregnating the cotton with\r\nthis alkaline solution, and subjecting it to a steaming operation,\r\nduring which the alkali, being volatile, passes away, leaving the\r\ncolouring matter behind in an insoluble form. The cotton is next passed\r\ninto a weak bath of the mordant (preferably the acetates of iron,\r\netc.)., this being used first cold and then gradually heated up. The dye\r\non the fibre and the mordant combine to form the desired colour, which\r\nis fixed on the fibre.\r\n\r\nThe chrome mordants are those which are most commonly applied by the\r\nmethods here sketched out, and with the large and increasing number of\r\nmordant dyes available, the processes should be worth attention from the\r\ncotton dyer.\r\n\r\nThe following recipes give fuller details than the outline sketches of\r\nthe methods given above for the use of the various dyes produced with\r\nthe mordant dyes and metallic mordants. In some cases as will be seen\r\nother dyes may be added to produce special shades:--\r\n\r\n_Dark Olive._--Prepare a bath from 8 lb. cutch, 4 lb. logwood extract, 7\r\nlb. fustic extract, 2 lb. copper sulphate.

Prepare a fresh bath containing 2 lb. extract of\r\nfustic, 3 oz. extract of indigo; enter cotton at 120° F., give three\r\nturns, raise temperature to 140° F., and turn to shade, lift, wash and\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n_Turkey Red._--One of the most important colours dyed on cotton is that\r\nknown as Turkey red, a bright red of a bluish tone, characterised by its\r\ngreat fastness to light, washing, etc. Strong alkalies turn it more\r\nyellowish, but weak acids and alkalies have little action.\r\n\r\nInto the history of the dyeing of Turkey red it is not intended to\r\nenter, those who are interested in the subject should refer to old works\r\non dyeing; nor is it intended to speak of old methods of producing it\r\nwith the aid of madder, but rather to give some of the most modern\r\nmethods for dyeing it with alizarine.\r\n\r\nMany processes differing somewhat in detail have been devised for dyeing\r\nTurkey red on cotton, and it is probable that no two Turkey-red dyers\r\nwork exactly alike. It is difficult to produce the most perfect red, and\r\na very great deal of care in carrying out the various operations is\r\nnecessary to obtain it. This care and the number of operations makes\r\nTurkey red an expensive colour to dye, and so shorter methods are in use\r\nwhich dye a red on cotton that is cheaper, but not so brilliant or fast\r\nas a true Turkey red.\r\n\r\n_Process_ 1.--This process is perhaps the most elaborate of all\r\nprocesses, but it yields a fine red. The process is applicable to cloth\r\nor yarn, although naturally the machinery used will vary to suit the\r\ndifferent conditions of the material. Bleached yarn or cloth may be\r\ntreated, although a full bleach is not necessary, but the cloth or yarn\r\nmust be clean or well scoured, so that it is free from grease and other\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\nOperation 1. Boil the cotton for six to eight hours with a carbonate of\r\nsoda lye at 1° Tw. in a kier at ordinary pressure, then wash well,\r\nwring, or, better, hydro-extract.\r\n\r\nOperation 2. First \"greening\": What is called the \"first green liquor\"\r\nis prepared by taking 15 lb. of gallipoli oil, 3 lb. phosphate of soda\r\nand 15 lb. carbonate of soda, the liquor to stand at 2° Tw. Originally\r\nthis \"liquor\" was made with sheep dung, but this is now omitted. The\r\ncotton is worked in this liquor, which is kept at 100° F., until it is\r\nthoroughly impregnated, then it is taken out, squeezed and dried, or in\r\nsome cases piled overnight and then stoved.\r\n\r\nOperation 3. Second green liquor. As before.\r\n\r\nOperation 4. Third green liquor. As before.\r\n\r\nOperation 5. A carbonate of soda liquor of 2° Tw. strength is prepared,\r\nand the cotton steeped in this until it is thoroughly impregnated, then\r\nit is wrung out and stoved. This is called \"white liquor treatment\".\r\n\r\nOperation 6. Second white liquor. As before.\r\n\r\nOperation 7. Steeping: Prepare a bath of water at 150° F., and steep for\r\ntwelve hours, then wring and dry.\r\n\r\nOperation 8. Sumacing: A liquor is made from 12 lb. sumac with water,\r\nand after straining from undissolved sumac leaves the liquor is made to\r\nstand at 2° Tw., this is kept at about a 100° F., and the cotton is well\r\nworked in it and allowed to steep for four hours, after which it is\r\ntaken out and wrung.\r\n\r\nOperation 9. Mordanting or aluming: 20 lb. of alum are dissolved in hot\r\nwater, and 5 lb. of soda crystals are slowly added in order to prepare a\r\nbasic alum solution; this is now made by the addition of water to stand\r\nat 8° Tw.\r\n\r\nThe sumaced cotton is worked in this bath and allowed to steep for\r\ntwenty-four hours, when it is taken out and wrung. Some dyers add a\r\nlittle tin crystals to this bath; others add a small quantity of red\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nOperation 10. The dyeing: A cold bath is prepared with 10 lb. to 12 lb.\r\nalizarine, 3 lb. sumac extract, and 2 oz. lime. The cotton is entered\r\ninto the cold bath, worked from fifteen to twenty minutes so as to get\r\nit thoroughly impregnated; then the heat is slowly raised to the boil\r\nand the dyeing carried on at that heat until the full shade is obtained,\r\nwhich usually takes about an hour. According to the brand of alizarine\r\nused so will the shade that is obtained vary, as will be mentioned later\r\non.\r\n\r\nOperation 11. First clearing: The dyed cotton is placed in a boiler and\r\nboiled for four hours with 3 lb. soda crystals and 3 lb. palm oil soap,\r\nafterwards washing well.\r\n\r\nOperation 12. Second clearing: The dyed cotton is again boiled for two\r\nhours with 2-1/2 lb. soap and 1/2 lb. tin crystals, then give a good\r\nwashing and dry.\r\n\r\nThis process is a long one--indeed, some dyers by repeating some of the\r\noperations lengthen it--and it takes at least two weeks, in some cases\r\nthree weeks, to carry out.\r\n\r\nThe first idea is to get the cotton thoroughly impregnated with the oil,\r\nand this oxidised to some extent on the fibre, and to this end the oil\r\ntreatments are carried out. In this process experience has shown that\r\nolive oil is the best to use, although other oils have been tried from\r\ntime to time. The sumacing enables the alumina to be more firmly fixed\r\non to the cotton. The alumina combines with both the oil and the sumac,\r\nand the resulting mordant produces a better and more brilliant red with\r\nthe alizarine. The clearing operations serve to remove impurities, to\r\nbrighten the colour, and to more fully fix it on the cotton.\r\n\r\n_Process_ 2.--Operation 1. The cotton is well bleached or scoured with\r\nsoda in the usual way.\r\n\r\nOperation 2. Oiling or preparing: A liquor is made from 10 lb. alizarine\r\noil or Turkey-red oil in 10 gallons water. This oil is prepared from\r\ncastor oil by a process of treatment with sulphuric acid, washing with\r\nwater and neutralising with caustic soda. The cotton is thoroughly\r\nimpregnated with this oil by steeping, then it is wrung out and dried.\r\n\r\nOperation 3. Steaming: The cotton is put into a steaming cottage or\r\ncontinuous steaming chamber and steamed for from one to one and a half\r\nhours at about 5 lb. pressure.\r\n\r\nOperation 4. A bath of red liquor (acetate of alumina) at 8° Tw. is\r\nprepared. Some dyers use basic alum at the same strength. In this bath\r\nthe cotton is steeped at 100° F. for two hours; then it is wrung out and\r\ndried. This aluming bath can be repeated. Next it is run through a bath\r\nof chalk and water containing 2 lb. chalk in 10 gallons water. This\r\nhelps to fix the alumina on the cotton. Phosphate of soda also makes a\r\ngood fixing agent.\r\n\r\nOperation 5. Dyeing: This is carried out in precisely the same way as in\r\nthe other process.\r\n\r\nOperation 6. Oiling: A second oiling is now given in a bath of 5 lb.\r\nalizarine oil, or Turkey-red oil, in 10 gallons water, after which the\r\ncotton is dried, when it is ready for further treatment. In place of\r\ngiving a second oiling after the dyeing, it is, perhaps, better to give\r\nit after the mordanting and before dyeing.\r\n\r\nOperation 7. Clearing: The dyed cotton is cleared with soap in the same\r\nmanner as the clearing operations of the first process, which see.\r\n\r\nAny of the treatments preparatory to, and following the actual dyeing\r\nof, any of these processes may be repeated if deemed necessary. The\r\ntext-books on dyeing and the technical journals devoted to the subject\r\nfrequently contain accounts of methods of dyeing Turkey red, but when\r\nthese come to be dissected the methods are but little more than variants\r\nof those which have just been given.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the theory or theories involved in this rather complex\r\nprocess of dyeing Turkey red, and that colourists are not agreed as to\r\nthe real part played by the oil, the sumac and the clearing operations\r\nin the formation of a Turkey red on cotton, nothing will be said here as\r\nto the theory of Turkey-red dyeing.\r\n\r\n_Alizarine Red._--It is possible to dye a red with alizarine on cotton\r\nwhich, while being a good colour, is not quite so fast to washing, etc.,\r\nas a Turkey red. This is done by using fewer treatments, as shown in the\r\nfollowing process:--\r\n\r\n_Process_ 1.--Boil the cotton in soda.\r\n_Process_ 2.--Oil with Turkey-red oil, as in the Turkey-red process\r\n   No. 2 above.\r\n_Process_ 3.--Mordant with alum or acetate of alumina.\r\n_Process_ 4.--Dye with alizarine as before.\r\n_Process_ 5.--Soap.\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct colouring matters which are sold commercially\r\nunder the name of \"alizarine\". These are: alizarine itself, which\r\nproduces a bluish shade of red; anthra-purpurine, which gives a similar\r\nbut less blue red than alizarine; and flavo-purpurine, which produces\r\nthe yellowest reds. The makers send out all these various products under\r\nvarious marks.\r\n\r\nFor dyeing Turkey reds the flavo-and anthra-purpurine brands or yellow\r\nalizarines are to be preferred; for pinks and rose shades the alizarine\r\nor blue shade brands are best.\r\n\r\n_Alizarine Pink._--This can be dyed in the same way as Turkey red, only\r\nusing for full pinks 4 per cent, of alizarine in the dye-bath, or for\r\npale pinks 1 to 2 per cent. It is advisable to reduce the strength of\r\nthe oiling and mordanting baths down to one-half.\r\n\r\n_Alizarine Violet._--Alizarine has the property of combining with iron\r\nto form a dark violet colour, and advantage is taken of this fact to dye\r\nwhat are called in the dyeing and calico printing trades alizarine\r\npurples and lilacs, although these do not resemble in hue or brilliance\r\nthe purples and lilacs which can be got from the direct dyes. They have\r\nnot the importance which they formerly possessed, and but a mere outline\r\nof two processes for their production will be given.\r\n\r\n_Alizarine Purple._--_Process_ 1. (1) Boil with soda, (2) prepare with\r\nTurkey red oil, (3) mordant by steeping in copperas liquor at 4° Tw. for\r\ntwenty minutes, take out, allow to lie on stillages overnight, then wash\r\nand dry. For deep purples it may be advisable to repeat these\r\ntreatments; for pale lilacs using them at half strength is advisable.\r\n(4) Dye with 8 to 10 per cent. of alizarine blue shade, working as\r\ndescribed under Turkey red. The best results are obtained when 1 per\r\ncent, of chalk is added to the dye-bath. (5) Soap as in red dyeing.\r\n\r\n_Process_ 2. (1) Boil with soda, (2) oil with Turkey-red oil, (3) steep\r\nin pyrolignite of iron (iron liquor) for one hour, then age by hanging\r\nin the air. (4) Dye as before. (5) Soap.\r\n\r\nFine blacks are got if after oiling the cotton is treated with sumac or\r\ntannic acid, then mordanted with iron and dyed with alizarine as usual.\r\n\r\n_Chocolate Browns._--Fine fast chocolate browns can be got from\r\nalizarine by using a mixed mordant of iron and alumina, either the\r\nacetate or the sulphate. By varying the relative proportions various\r\nshades can be obtained.\r\n\r\n_Alizarine Orange_--Prepare the cotton as if for dyeing a Turkey red,\r\nbut use in the dye-bath 8 to 10 per cent. of Alizarine orange.\r\n\r\n_Alizarine Blue_--The cotton is boiled three hours with 3 per cent.\r\nammonia soda at 30 lb. pressure, and then washed thoroughly. The boiled,\r\nwashed and hydro-extracted yarn is oiled with a solution containing from\r\n1/4 lb. to 1-1/2 lb. Turkey-red oil, 50 per cent. for every gallon of\r\nwater. It is then wrung out evenly and dried for twelve hours at 150° F.\r\n\r\n_Tannin Grounding._\r\n\r\nThe oiled and dried cotton is worked three-quarters of an hour in a vat\r\ncontaining a tannin solution (1 oz. per gallon). The cotton remains in\r\nthis liquid, which is allowed to cool off for twelve hours, then it is\r\nhydro-extracted. Sumac turns the shade somewhat greener, which is\r\nnoticed especially after bleaching, therefore tannin is given the\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n_Chromium Mordant._\r\n\r\nThe cotton treated with tannin and then hydro-extracted is worked cold\r\nfor one hour in a vat containing a solution of chromium chloride at 32°\r\nTw., and remains in this solution twelve hours. The cotton is then\r\nhydro-extracted and washed directly; it is best to employ running water.\r\nA special fixation does not take place. The cotton is now ready for\r\ndyeing. The solution of chromium chloride and the tannin solution can be\r\nused continuously, adding fresh liquor to keep the baths up to strength.\r\n\r\n_Dyeing_--For dyeing, water free from lime must be used. Water having\r\nnot more than 2.5° hardness can be employed if it is corrected with\r\nacetic acid, thereby converting the carbonate of lime into acetate of\r\nlime. Very calcareous water must be freed from lime before use. The\r\ndye-bath contains for 100 lb. cotton 15 lb. Alizarine blue paste (A R or\r\nF, according to the shade desired), 35 lb. acetic acid (12° Tw.), 15-1/2\r\nlb. ammonia (25 per cent.), 2-1/4 oz. tannin. The cotton is worked a\r\nquarter of an hour in the cold; the temperature is raised slowly to a\r\nboil, taking about one hour, and the cotton is worked three-quarters of\r\nan hour at that heat. Finally the cotton is washed and hydro-extracted.\r\nThe dyed and washed cotton is steamed two hours at 15 lb. to 22 lb.\r\npressure. Steaming turns the shade greener and darker, and increases the\r\nfastness. After steaming the cotton it is soaped one or two hours at the\r\nboil, with or without pressure. According to the quality of water\r\nemployed, 2 to 5 parts soap per 1,000 parts water are taken.\r\n\r\n_Brown._--A fine brown is got by a similar process to this, if instead\r\nof Alizarine blue, Alizarine orange is used in the dye-bath. A deeper\r\nbrown still if Anthracene brown, or a mixture of Anthracene brown and\r\nAlizarine blue, be used.\r\n\r\n_Claret Red._--Clarets to maroon shade of red are got by preparing the\r\ncotton as for blue given above, then dyeing with alizarine.\r\n\r\n_Logwood Black._--One of the most important colours that come under this\r\nsection is logwood black, the formation of which on the fibre depends\r\nupon the fact that the colouring principle of logwood forms a black\r\ncolour lake with iron and also one with chromium.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of dyeing logwood blacks on cotton, whether that be\r\nin form of hanks of yarns, warps or pieces. While these blacks may be,\r\nand in the case of hanks are, dyed by what may be termed an intermittent\r\nprocess, yet for warps and piece goods a continuous process is preferred\r\nby dyers. Examples of both methods will be given. As in the dyeing of\r\nTurkey reds it is probable that no two dyers of logwood blacks quite\r\nagree in the details of their process, there may be variations in the\r\norder of the various baths and in their relative strengths. Typical\r\nmethods will be noted here.\r\n\r\n=Dyeing Logwood Black on Yarn in Hanks.=--Operation 1. Sumacing: Prepare\r\na bath with 10 lb. sumac extract in hot water. Work the yarn in this for\r\nhalf an hour, then allow to steep for six hours or overnight, lift and\r\nwring. The liquor which is left may be used again for another lot of\r\nyarn by adding 5 lb. sumac extract for each successive lot of yarn. In\r\nplace of using sumac the cheaper myrabolam extract may be used.\r\n\r\nOperation 2. Ironing or Saddening: Prepare a bath with 3-1/2 gallons\r\nnitrate of iron, 80° Tw. Work the yarn in this for fifteen minutes, then\r\nwring out. The bath may be used again when 1 gallon of nitrate of iron\r\nis added for each lot of yarn worked in it. In place of the nitrate of\r\niron, the pyrolignite of iron or iron liquor may be used.\r\n\r\nOperation 3. Liming: Work for ten minutes in a weak bath of milk of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nOperation 4. Dyeing: This is done in a bath made from 10 lb. logwood\r\nextract and 1 lb. fustic extract. The yarn is entered into the cold or\r\ntepid bath, the heat slowly raised to about 150° F, then kept at this\r\nheat until a good black is got, when the yarn is taken out, rinsed and\r\nwrung. The addition of the fustic extract enables a much deeper and\r\njetter shade of black to be dyed.\r\n\r\nOperation 5. Saddening: To obtain a fuller black the dyed cotton is sent\r\nthrough a bath of 1-1/2 lb. of copperas, then washed well.\r\n\r\nOperation 6. Soaping: Work for twenty minutes in a bath of 2 lb. soap at\r\n140° to 150° F. Then wash well.\r\n\r\nMuch the same process may be followed for dyeing logwood black on warps\r\nand piece goods, jiggers being used for each operation.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to first work the cotton in pyrolignite (iron liquor)\r\nat 10° Tw., until it is thoroughly impregnated, then to dry and hang in\r\nthe air for some hours, next to pass through lime water to fix the iron,\r\nand then to dye as before.\r\n\r\n_Continuous Process._--In this case a continuous dyeing machine is\r\nprovided, fitted with five to six compartments. The cotton is first of\r\nall prepared by steeping in a bath of 12 lb. myrabolam extract for\r\nseveral hours, then it is taken to the continuous machine and run in\r\nsuccession through nitrate of iron liquor, lime water, logwood and\r\nfustic, iron liquor and water. The nitrate of iron bath contains 2\r\ngallons of the nitrate to 10 gallons of water, and as the pieces go\r\nthrough fresh additions of this liquor are made from time to time to\r\nkeep up the volume and strength of the liquor to the original points.\r\n\r\nThe logwood bath is made from 10 lb. logwood extract and 1 lb. fustic\r\nextract, and it is used at about 160° F. The quantities here given will\r\nserve for 100 lb. of cotton, and it is well to add them dissolved up in\r\nhot water in small quantities from time to time as the cotton goes\r\nthrough the bath.\r\n\r\nThe iron liquor given after the dyeing contains 2 lb. of copperas in 10\r\ngallons of water.\r\n\r\nBetween the various compartments of the machine is fitted squeezing\r\nrollers to press out any surplus liquor, which is run back into the\r\ncompartment. The rate of running the warp or pieces through should not\r\nbe too rapid, and the dyer must adapt the rate to the speed with which\r\nthe cloth dyes up in the dye-bath.\r\n\r\nThe addition of a little red liquor (alumina acetate) to the iron bath\r\nis sometimes made, this is advantageous, as it results in the production\r\nof a finer black. Iron by itself tends to give a rusty-looking, or\r\nbrownish black, but the violet, or lilac shade that alumina gives with\r\nlogwood, tones the black and makes it look more pleasant.\r\n\r\nSome dyers add a small quantity, 1 per cent., of the weight of the\r\ncotton of sulphate of copper to the iron bath, others add even more than\r\nthis. Some use nitrate of copper; the copper giving a greenish shade of\r\nblack with logwood, and this tones down the iron black and makes it more\r\nbloomy in appearance.\r\n\r\nSingle bath methods of dyeing logwood blacks are in use, such methods\r\nare not economical as a large quantity, both of dye-wood and mordants,\r\nremain in the bath unused. Although full intense blacks can be dyed with\r\nthem, the black is rather loosely fixed and tends to rub off. This is\r\nbecause as both the dye-stuff and the mordant are in the same bath\r\ntogether they tend to enter into combination and form a colour lake that\r\nprecipitates out in the dye-bath, causing the loss of material alluded\r\nto above, while some of it gets mechanically fixed on the cotton, in a\r\nmore or less loose form, and this looseness causes the colour to rub\r\noff.\r\n\r\nFor a _chrome-logwood black_, a dye-bath is made with 3 lb. bichromate\r\nof potash, 100 gallons logwood decoction at 3° Tw., and 6-1/2 lb.\r\nhydrochloric acid. Enter the cotton into the cold bath, raise slowly to\r\nthe boil and work until the cotton has acquired a full black blue\r\ncolour, then take it out and rinse in a hot lime water when a blue black\r\nwill be got.\r\n\r\nA _copper-logwood black_ is got by taking 100 gallons logwood decoction\r\nat 3° Tw., and 6 lb. copper acetate (verdigris); the cotton is entered\r\ncold and brought up to the boil. Copper nitrate may be used in the place\r\nof the copper acetate, when it is a good plan to add a little soda to\r\nthe bath. Some dyers in working a copper-logwood black make the dye-bath\r\nfrom 100 gallons logwood liquor at 2° Tw., 4 lb. copper sulphate\r\n(bluestone) and 4 lb. soda. This bath is used at about 180° to 190° F.,\r\nfor three-quarters of an hour, then the cotton is lifted out, wrung and\r\naged or as it is sometimes called \"smothered\" for five hours. The\r\noperations are repeated two or three times to develop a full black.\r\n\r\nLogwood black dyeing has lost much of its importance of late years owing\r\nto the introduction of the many direct blacks, which are much easier of\r\napplication and leave the cotton with a fuller and softer feel.\r\n\r\n_Logwood Greys._--These are much dyed on cotton and are nothing more\r\nthan weak logwood blacks, and may be dyed by the same processes only\r\nusing baths of about one-tenth the strength.\r\n\r\nBy a one-bath process 5 lb. of logwood are made into a decoction and to\r\nthis 1 lb. of copperas (ferrous sulphate) is added and the cotton is\r\ndyed at about 150° F. in this bath. By adding to the dye-bath small\r\nquantities of other dye-woods, fustic, peach wood, sumach, etc., greys\r\nof various shades are obtained. Some recipes bearing on this point are\r\ngiven in this section.\r\n\r\nLogwood is not only used for dyeing blacks and greys as the principal\r\ncolouring matter, but is also used as a shading colour along with cutch,\r\nfustic, quercitron, etc., in dyeing olives, browns, etc., and among the\r\nrecipes given in this section examples of its use in this direction will\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nThe dye-woods--fustic, Brazil wood, bar wood, Lima wood, cam wood,\r\ncutch, peach wood, quercitron bark, Persian berries--have since the\r\nintroduction of the direct dyes lost much of their importance and are\r\nnow little used. Cutch is used in the dyeing of browns and several\r\nrecipes have already been given. Their production consists essentially\r\nin treating the cotton in a bath of cutch, either alone or for the\r\npurpose of shading with other dye-woods when the cotton takes up the\r\ntannin and colouring matter of the cutch, etc. The colour is then\r\ndeveloped by treatment with bichromate of potash, either with or without\r\nthe addition of an iron salt to darken the shade of brown.\r\n\r\nThe usual methods of applying all the other dye-woods, to obtain\r\nscarlets to reds with Brazil wood, Lima wood, peach wood; or yellows\r\nwith fustic, quercitron or Persian berries, is to first prepare the\r\ncotton with sumac, then mordant with alumina acetate or tin crystals\r\n(the latter gives the brightest shades), then dye in a decoction of the\r\ndye-woods. Sometimes the cotton is boiled in a bath of the wood when it\r\ntakes up some of the dye-wood, next there is added alumina acetate or\r\ntin crystals and the dyeing is continued when the colour becomes\r\ndeveloped and fixed upon the cotton.\r\n\r\nIron may be used as a mordant for any of these dye-woods but it gives\r\ndull sad shades.\r\n\r\nChrome mordants can also be used and these produce darker shades than\r\ntin or alumina mordants.\r\n\r\nAs practically all these dye-woods are now not used by themselves it has\r\nnot been deemed necessary to give specific recipes for their\r\napplication, on previous pages several are given showing their use in\r\ncombination with other dyes.\r\n\r\nThe dye-stuff Dinitroso-resorcine or Solid green O is used along with\r\niron mordants for producing fast greens and with chrome mordants for\r\nproducing browns to a limited extent in cotton dyeing. The following\r\nrecipes give the details of the process.\r\n\r\n_Green._--Steep the cotton yarn or cloth in the following liquor until\r\nwell impregnated, then dry: 3 gallons iron liquor (pyrolignite of iron),\r\n22° Tw. gallons of water, 3/4 gallon acetic acid, 12° Tw., 2 lb.\r\nammonium chloride. Then pass the cotton through a warm bath of 3 oz.\r\nphosphate of soda and 4 oz. chalk per gallon, then enter into a dye-bath\r\ncontaining 6 lb. Solid green O. Work as described for dyeing alizarine\r\nred. For darker greens of a Russian green shade use 10 lb. of solid\r\ngreen O, in the dye-bath.\r\n\r\n_Brown._--A fine brown is got by steeping the cotton in a bath of 8 lb.\r\nSolid green O, 6-3/4 gallons water, 1-1/2 gallons ammonia and 2 lb.\r\nacetate of chrome; dry, then pass through a soap-bath, wash and dry.\r\n\r\n_Deep Olive Brown._--Mix 8 lb. Solid green O and 4-1/2 lb. borax with 6\r\ngallons water, add 1/2 lb. Turkey-red oil, 5 lb. ammonia, then 2 gallons\r\nwater and 1-1/2 lb. copper-soda solution and another 2 gallons water.\r\nSteep the cotton in this, dry, soap well and wash. The copper-soda\r\nsolution is made from 10 lb. chloride of copper (75° Tw.), 5 lb.\r\ntartaric acid, 12 lb. caustic soda (75° Tw.) and 4 lb. glycerine.\r\n\r\n_Khaki._--Make the dye liquor from 14 lb. Solid green O, 1/2 lb.\r\nAlizarine yellow N, 1 lb. caustic soda (36° Tw.), 1/2 lb. Turkey-red oil\r\nand 8 gallons water. To this add 2-1/2 lb. acetate of chrome (32° Tw.),\r\n2-1/4 lb. copper-soda solution and 4 gallons water.\r\n\r\n_Sage Green._--Use 1-1/4 lb. Solid green O, 3 lb. caustic soda (36°\r\nTw.), 1/2 lb. Ceruleine, 1/2 lb. Turkey-red oil, 1 gallon water to which\r\nis added 2-1/2 lb. acetate of chrome (32° Tw.) and 2-1/4 lb. copper-soda\r\nsolution dissolved in 4 gallons water.\r\n\r\n_Pale Brown._--Use 4 lb. Solid green O, 2-1/2 lb. borax, 3 lb. ammonia,\r\n1/2 lb. Turkey-red oil, 6 gallons of water and 1-1/2 lb. copper-soda\r\nsolution dissolved in 2 gallons water.\r\n\r\n_Pale Fawn Brown._--The dye-bath is made from 1/2 lb. Alizarine, 1-1/4\r\nlb. Solid green O, 1-1/2 lb. borax, 1/2 lb. Turkey-red oil and 5 gallons\r\nof water to which is added 1-1/2 lb. acetate of chrome (32° Tw.), 1-1/2\r\nlb. copper-soda solution and 4 gallons water. In all cases the cotton is\r\nsteeped in the dye liquors until thoroughly impregnated, then the excess\r\nliquor is wrung out, the cotton dried, then passed through a soap bath,\r\nwashed well and dried.\r\n\r\n_Dark Brown._--Place the cotton in a lukewarm bath of 25 lb. cutch and\r\n1-1/2 lb. copper sulphate; work for half an hour, then steep for six\r\nhours, then lift, wring and enter into a bath of 3-1/4 lb. bichromate of\r\npotash at 160° F. for twenty minutes. Then wash and dry.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Brown._--Make a bath with 14 lb. cutch and 1/2 lb. copper\r\nsulphate; work in this bath for four hours at 120° F., then pass into a\r\nbath of 2 lb. copperas and 1/2 lb. chalk, work for half an hour in the\r\ncold, then pass into a hot bath of 2-1/2 lb. bichromate of potash at\r\n150° F. for half an hour.\r\n\r\n_Dark Brown._--Make a dye-bath with 15 lb. cutch, 2 lb. logwood extract\r\nand 2 lb. fustic extract; work the cotton in this at 160° F. for three\r\nhours, then pass into a cold bath of 1 lb. copperas and 1/4 lb. chalk\r\nfor half an hour, then into a bath of 3 lb. bichromate of potash for\r\nhalf an hour at 150° F., then wash and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n(7) PRODUCTION OF COLOUR DIRECT UPON COTTON FIBRES.\r\n\r\nBy the action of nitrous acid upon the salts of the primary organic\r\namines the so-called diazo compounds are formed. An example of this\r\nimportant process is that of nitrous acid on aniline hydrochloride shown\r\nin the following equation:--\r\n\r\nC{6}H{5}NH{2} + HCl + HNO{2}   2H{2}O + C{6}H{5}N:NCl\r\nHydrochloric acid        Nitrous   Water,    Diazo-benzene\r\naniline,                 acid,               chloride.\r\n\r\nThese diazo compounds are distinguished by their active properties,\r\nespecially in combining with amines in acid solutions, or with phenols\r\nin alkaline solution to form the azo dyes, thus diazobenzene chloride\r\nwill combine with naphthol to form naphthol-azo-benzene, thus:--\r\n\r\nC{6}H{5}N:NCl + C{10}H{7}OH + NaOH =\r\nDiazo-benzene chloride, Naphthol, Caustic soda.\r\n\r\nC{10}H{6}OHN:NC{6}H{5} + NaCl + H{2}O\r\nNaphthol-azo-benzene,        Salt,  Water.\r\n\r\nThese azo compounds are coloured, but are perfectly insoluble in water,\r\nalkalies, or acids; on the other hand the sulphonates of these bodies\r\nare easily soluble and form the numerous azo dyes now so largely made\r\nand used in wool and silk dyeing, but which on account of their being\r\nsulphonates cannot be used for cotton dyeing.\r\n\r\nMethods have been devised for producing the insoluble azo colours direct\r\nupon the fibres. They are also called naphthol colours from the use of\r\nbeta-and alpha-naphthol in their production. Although these azo dyes,\r\nwhen produced on the fibre, do not possess the fastness of the alizarine\r\ndyes, yet, on account of their cheapness and relative great fastness to\r\nsoap and the action of sunlight, they are better than many of the newer\r\ncotton dyes.\r\n\r\nBy this method (first introduced in England by Holliday) colours of\r\nexceptional brightness and fastness can be obtained which were not\r\nobtainable with the dyes then known. Those which are obtained from\r\nphenols are of the first importance.\r\n\r\n_The Diazotisation of the Amido Bases._\r\n\r\nWith most bases this must be accomplished as cold as possible below 65°\r\nF. At a higher temperature, and when allowed to stand, most diazo\r\ncompounds decompose quickly with evolution of nitrogen, which\r\ndecomposition results in the mixture losing its power of producing\r\ncolour, or at the most gives unsatisfactory results. For this reason it\r\nis therefore always necessary to work as cold and as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe amido-azo bodies, whose compounds with the phenols are also\r\ndistinguished by their great fastness, are in this respect an exception.\r\nThey can be diazotised at the ordinary temperature, and their diazo\r\ncompounds are much stabler than those, for example, of alpha-and\r\nbeta-naphthylamine or of aniline, which must always be used as quickly\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nFrom anisidine, phenetidine and amido-diphenylamine, still more stable\r\ndiazo compounds can be obtained, but the prices of these bases are\r\nrather high, and the colours produced with them are not fast to light.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest and most convenient method of obtaining nitrous acid for\r\ndiazotising is by the action of a mineral acid, preferably hydrochloric\r\nacid, upon nitrite of soda.\r\n\r\nFor diazotising one molecule of base requires one molecule of\r\nhydrochloric acid to form a salt of the base, a molecule of nitrite of\r\nsoda, and another molecule of hydrochloric acid to decompose the\r\nnitrite. The diazotisation is better carried out and the diazo solution\r\nrendered more stable if another molecule of hydrochloric acid and an\r\nexcess of nitrite of soda are used. The presence of an excess of nitrite\r\ncan be determined by testing the diazo solution with potassium iodide\r\nstarch paper, which in the presence of excess of nitrite gives the blue\r\niodine starch reaction.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the diazotisation, the base is first dissolved in the\r\nwhole amount of hydrochloric acid which has to be used, and the solution\r\nis filtered. The diazotisation takes place in the manner shown in the\r\nequation:--\r\n\r\n  C{6}H{5}NH{2} + HCl   +         HCl             +        NaNO{2} =\r\nAniline hydrochloride,         Hydrochloric acid,         Sodium nitrite,\r\n\r\n   NaCl     +       C{6}H{5}N:NCl        +      H{2}0\r\n   Salt,         Diazo-benzene chloride,          Water.\r\n\r\nThe bases which form salts soluble with difficulty, such as nitroaniline\r\nand the amido-azo bodies, offer special difficulties in diazotising.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that the operation with these is best carried out if\r\nthe chemically pure bases in paste form are mixed with the requisite\r\namount of nitrite, and the diluted paste then poured into the\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nIt has been found by experience that the colour is developed much\r\nbrighter upon the fibre when the diazo solution contains acetic acid and\r\nno free mineral acid. However, the diazotisation is better carried out\r\nwith hydrochloric acid, and the presence of the latter is necessary to\r\ngive stability to the solution. If before the diazo solution is used a\r\nquantity of acetate of soda be added to it, the free hydrochloric acid\r\nliberates acetic acid from the acetate, and the chloride of the diazo\r\nbody changes into its acetate. It is better to add an excess above the\r\ntwo molecules of acetate of soda which are required.\r\n\r\nThe combination when aniline and beta-naphthol are used, as the amine\r\nand phenol respectively, is shown in the following equations:--\r\n\r\n   C{6}H{5}N:NCl        +    C{10}H{7}OH      +\r\nDiazo-benzene chloride,         B. naphthol,\r\n\r\nNaOH = 2NaCl    +   C{6}H{5}N:NC{10}H{6}OH    +    H{2}O\r\nCaustic soda,         Benzene- azo-naphthol,         Water.\r\n\r\nOr, with naphthylamine and naphthol, thus:--\r\n\r\nC{10}H{7}N:NCl     +     C{10}H{7}OH     +     NaOH =\r\n\r\n  NaCl     +     C{10}H{7}N:NC{10}H{6}OH     +   H{2}O\r\n                   Naphthalene azo-naphthol.\r\n\r\nBy the action of nitrous acid upon amido-azo bodies a group of bodies\r\ncalled diazo-azo compounds are obtained which contain the group N:N\r\ntwice over, thus:--\r\n\r\n  C{6}H{5}N:NC{6}H{4}NH{2}HCl + NaNO{2} + 2HCl =\r\n        Benzene-azo-aniline-hydrochloride,\r\n\r\nNaCl + C{6}H{5}N:NC{6}H{4}N:NCl + 2H{2}O.\r\n           Diazo-azo-benzene-chloride.\r\n\r\nWhen this compound is combined with naphthol diazo-azo dyes are\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nC{6}H{5}N:NC{6}H{4}N:NC{10}H{6}OH.\r\nBenzene-azo-benzene-azo-naphthol.\r\n\r\nThe molecular weights of the bases, phenols and chemicals employed are\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n1. Hydrochloric acid, HCl--36.5. 2. Caustic soda, NaOH--40. 3. Nitrite\r\nof soda, NaNO{2}--69. 4. Acetate of soda, NaC{2}H{3}O{2}3H{2}O--136.\r\n\r\n1. Commercial hydrochloric acid at 32° Tw. contains about 365 grams of\r\nHCl in a litre, or 3-1/2 lb. in a gallon.\r\n\r\n2. The commercial 77 per cent. soda must always be used, and for\r\npractical purposes it may be taken as pure. It is best to make a\r\nsolution which contains 160 grams NaOH in a litre of water.\r\n\r\n3. The nitrite supplied is almost chemically pure, and is easily soluble\r\nin water. In order to make a solution 140 or 290 grams are dissolved per\r\nlitre.\r\n\r\n4. Crystallised acetate of soda contains 3 molecules of water of\r\ncrystallisation, and is usually somewhat moist. Instead of 136 grams 140\r\nare taken to allow for moisture. The amount is dissolved in about 500\r\ncubic centimetres of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bases._\r\n\r\n1. Aniline, C{6}H{5}NH{2}--93.\r\n2.

On the other\r\nhand, the cotton can be prepared with the phenol and the colour\r\ndeveloped by passing into a bath of the diazotised base, and practice\r\nhas shown that this latter proceeding is the best. Practically the only\r\nphenol that is used is the beta-naphthol; alpha-naphthol is occasionally\r\nused, but not often.\r\n\r\nThe purer the beta-naphthol the better, especially for producing the\r\nparanitroaniline red. Various preparations of beta-naphthol have been\r\nbrought out by colour makers.\r\n\r\nThe process of dyeing cotton with a naphthol colour takes place in two\r\nstages, the first being the grounding or preparing with the naphthol,\r\nthe second the developing with the diazotised base. Some of the effects\r\nwhich can be obtained from the two naphthols and various bases are given\r\nin the following table:--\r\n\r\n     Base.

In order to produce the best and brightest shades\r\nthese two bodies must be quite pure. The following directions may be\r\nfollowed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dyeing Paranitroaniline Red on Yarn.=\r\n\r\nIt unfortunately happens that this red does not admit of being worked in\r\nlarge quantities at a time, particularly in the diazo bath where the\r\ncolour is developed, as the previous operations seem to render the yarn\r\nslightly waterproof, and hence if large quantities of yarn were dealt\r\nwith at one time some would be found to be dyed all right, others would\r\nbe defective. It has, therefore, been found best to work only about 2\r\nlb. of yarn at a time, carefully carrying out each operation with this\r\nquantity. As, however, the process can be quickly worked it follows that\r\nin the course of a day a fairly large quantity of yarn can be treated.\r\n\r\n1. _Grounding._ The grounding or preparing bath for 100 lb. of yarn is\r\nbest made in the following manner: 4 lb. of beta-naphthol are stirred in\r\n2-1/2 lb. of caustic soda liquor 70° Tw., then 1-1/2 quarts of boiling\r\nwater is added, when dissolved 1-1/2 quarts of cold water. In a separate\r\nvessel dissolve 5 lb. Turkey-red oil in 11 quarts of water, then mix the\r\ntwo liquors together and add sufficient water to make up the whole to 12\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\nIn working sufficient of this liquor is taken and put into a deep tub in\r\nwhich 2 lb. of yarn can be conveniently worked. It is best to work at a\r\ntepid heat, say 100° to 110° F.; 2 lb. of the yarn are worked in this\r\nliquor, so that it becomes thoroughly impregnated, then it is gently\r\nwrung out and hung up. This operation is repeated with each 2 lb. until\r\nthe whole 100 lb. has been treated, adding from time to time some of the\r\nnaphthol liquor to make up for that taken up by the cotton. When all the\r\nyarn has been through the liquor, give it another dip through the same\r\nliquor. Place the yarn in a hydro-extractor for five to seven minutes.\r\nNext open out the yarn well, and hang on sticks and dry in a stove at\r\n140° to 150° F. The stove should be heated with iron pipes, through\r\nwhich steam at 30 lb. to 40 lb. pressure passes. This stove should be\r\nreserved entirely for this work, for if other goods be dried in it along\r\nwith the naphthol-prepared cotton, any steam or acid vapours which might\r\nbe given off from the former might damage the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen thoroughly dry the yarn is ready for the next operation.\r\n\r\n2. _Developing._ The developing bath is made in the following manner:\r\n1-1/2 lb. paranitroaniline is mixed with 1-1/2 gallons of boiling water,\r\nand 1-3/4 quarts of hydrochloric acid at 30° to 32° Tw. Stir well until\r\nthe paranitroaniline is completely dissolved, add 3-1/2 gallons of cold\r\nwater, which will cause a precipitation of the hydrochlorate of\r\nparanitroaniline as a yellow powder. Let the mixture thoroughly cool\r\noff, best by allowing to stand all night; 1-1/4 lb. of nitrite of soda\r\nis dissolved in 4 quarts of cold water, and this solution is added to\r\nthe paranitroaniline solution slowly and with constant stirring; in\r\nabout fifteen to twenty minutes the diazotisation will be complete. At\r\nthis and following stages the temperature of working should be kept as\r\nlow as possible. Some dyers use ice in preparing their diazo solutions,\r\nand certainly the best results are attained thereby, but with\r\nparanitroaniline the ice can be dispensed with. After the end of the\r\ntime sufficient cold water is added to bring the volume of the liquor up\r\nto 10 gallons. This diazo liquor will keep for some days, but it\r\ndecomposes in time, so that it should not be kept too long.\r\n\r\nAnother liquor is made by dissolving 4 lb. acetate of soda in 11 quarts\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nThe developing bath is made by taking 4 gallons of the diazo liquor and\r\n1 gallon of the acetate liquor and mixing together, and in this bath the\r\nprepared yarn, 2 lb. at a time, is worked. The colour develops\r\nimmediately. The yarn when dyed is lifted out, wrung, and then it is\r\nwell washed with water, soaped in a bath at 120° F., with a liquor\r\ncontaining 1/2 oz. soap per gallon, then dried. As the cotton yarn is\r\nbeing passed through the developing bath, the latter is freshened up\r\nfrom time to time by suitable additions of the diazo and acetate liquors\r\nin the proportions given above.\r\n\r\nSome dyers use a special form of dye vat for dyeing paranitroaniline red\r\non yarn, whose construction can be seen from Fig. 27.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Dye-tub for Paranitroaniline Red.]\r\n\r\nThe beta-naphthol bath does not keep well and in time tends to grow\r\nbrown, and when this occurs stains are invariably produced on the\r\ncotton. When the yarn or cloth has been prepared with the beta-naphthol,\r\nand dried, the developing should be immediately proceeded with, for it\r\nis found that by allowing the prepared cotton to lie about it becomes\r\ncovered with brown stains, and when such stained cotton is passed\r\nthrough the developing bath stains and defective dyeing result.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that by adding a little tartar emetic to the\r\nbeta-naphthol bath this is largely if not entirely prevented, and the\r\nprepared cloth may be kept for a reasonable length of time before\r\nproceeding with the development without fear of stains being formed.\r\n\r\nVarious additions have been made from time to time to the naphthol bath.\r\nSome of these take the form of special preparations of the colour\r\nmanufacturers, and are sold as naphthol D, naphthol X, red developer C,\r\netc., sometimes gum tragacanth has been added, at others in place of\r\nTurkey-red oil there is used a soap made from castor oil with soda and\r\nammonia, but such complicated baths do not yield any better results than\r\nthe simple preparing liquor given above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Padding Machine for Paranitroaniline Red.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dyeing Paranitroaniline Red on Piece Goods.=\r\n\r\nThe dyeing of this red on to piece goods only differs from that on yarn\r\nby reason of the difference in the form of material that is dealt with.\r\n\r\n1. _Preparing or Grounding._--The same liquor may be used. This\r\noperation is best done on a padding machine, a sketch of which is given\r\nin Fig. 26, showing the course of the cloth through the liquor. This is\r\ncontained in the box of the machine, and this is kept full by a constant\r\nstream flowing in from a store vat placed beside the machine. After\r\ngoing through the liquor, the cloth passes between a pair of squeezing\r\nrollers which squeeze out the surplus liquor. Fig. 28 shows a view of a\r\npadding machine adapted for grounding paranitroaniline reds. After the\r\npadding, the cloth is dried by being sent over a set of drying\r\ncylinders, or through what is known as the hot flue.\r\n\r\n2. _The Developing._--After being dried, the pieces are sent through a\r\npadding machine charged with the developing liquor made as described\r\nabove, after which the cloth is rinsed, then soaped, and then washed.\r\nSome dyers use a continuous machine for these operations, such as shown\r\nin Fig. 29.\r\n\r\nWhile the developing bath used for piece goods may be the same as that\r\nused for yarns, some dyers prefer to use one made somewhat differently,\r\nthus 6-1/4 lb. paranitroaniline are mixed with 7 gallons boiling-water\r\nand 1-1/2 gallons hydrochloric acid; when dissolved 16 gallons of cold\r\nwater are added, then, after completely cooling, 3-1/2 lb. sodium\r\nnitrite dissolved in 3 gallons cold water. After twenty minutes, when\r\nthe diazotisation is complete, water is added to make the whole up to 40\r\ngallons. The acetate liquor is made from 13-1/4 lb. acetate of soda in\r\n13-1/2 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nEqual quantities of these two liquors are used in making the developing\r\nbath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29--Developing Machine for Paranitroaniline Red.]\r\n\r\nOf late years, under the names of Azophor red P N, Nitrazol C,\r\nNitrosamine, etc., there has been offered to dyers preparations of\r\ndiazotised paranitroaniline in the form of a powder or paste, readily\r\nsoluble in water, that will keep in a cool and dry place for any\r\nreasonable length of time. These are prepared in various ways, and to\r\nany dyer who does not want the trouble of diazotising the\r\nparanitroaniline they offer some advantages. They produce a red equal in\r\nevery respect to that obtained from paranitroaniline. The following\r\ndetails show the method to be followed with some of these products,\r\nothers are very similar to make the developing baths.\r\n\r\n_Paranitroaniline Red with Nitrazol C._--Dissolve 25 lb. Nitrazol C in\r\n12 gallons of cold water with constant stirring, then add sufficient\r\ncold water to make 37 gallons. In another vessel dissolve 11 lb. of\r\nacetate of soda in 5-1/2 gallons water, then add 1-1/2 gallons caustic\r\nsoda, 36° Tw., mixed with 5-1/2 gallons water. The developing bath is\r\nmade by mixing both these solutions. It will suffice for both yarn and\r\npiece goods.\r\n\r\n_Paranitroaniline Red with Azophor Red P N._--Dissolve 5-1/2 lb. of\r\nAzophor red P N in 4 gallons of water--it dissolves almost completely\r\nbut usually a few particles of a flocculent character remain\r\nundissolved, these can be removed; 2-1/4 gallons of caustic soda lye of\r\n36° Tw. are diluted with water to 10 gallons, and this is added with\r\nconstant stirring to the azophor red P N solution. When all is mixed and\r\na clear solution obtained, the developing bath is ready for use, and is\r\nused in the same way as the paranitroaniline bath.\r\n\r\n_Metanitroaniline Orange._--This orange is produced in the same way as\r\nthe paranitroaniline red, using metanitroaniline or Azophor orange M N\r\nin place of the paranitroaniline or the Azophor red P N given for the\r\nred. The quantities of all the materials used are identical.\r\n\r\n_Nitrosamine Red._--Dissolve 5 lb. Nitrosamine red in 5 gallons of water\r\nand 2-1/4 lb. hydrochloric acid, when well mixed there is added 2-1/2\r\nlb. acetate of soda, when all is dissolved add sufficient water to make\r\n6-1/2 gallons. This bath is used exactly in the same way as the\r\nparanitroaniline developing bath, and it produces identical results in\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\n_Paranitroaniline Brown._--By boiling the paranitroaniline red dyed\r\ncotton in a weak bath of copper sulphate a very fine fast brown\r\nresembling a cutch brown is produced. A better plan, however, is to\r\nprepare the cotton with a ground containing an alkaline solution of\r\ncopper, 3 lb. beta-naphthol are dissolved in 5 pints of caustic soda lye\r\nof 36° Tw., to which is added 5 lb. Turkey-red oil and 10 pints alkaline\r\ncopper solution, water being added to make 13 gallons of liquor. The\r\ncotton is treated in this way as with the ordinary beta-naphthol\r\npreparation. The alkaline copper solution is made by taking 5 pints of\r\ncopper chloride solution at 76° Tw., adding 3-1/4 lb. tartaric acid, 6\r\npints caustic soda lye, 70° Tw., and 2 pints of glycerine. The\r\ndeveloping bath for the brown is the same as for the paranitroaniline\r\nred, or the Azophor red P N bath may be used.\r\n\r\n_Toluidine Orange._--For this colour the cotton is prepared with the\r\nbeta-naphthol in the ordinary way. The developing bath is made from 2\r\nlb. orthonitrotoluidine mixed with 12 pints boiling water and 2-1/4\r\npints hydrochloric acid; when dissolved allow to cool and then add\r\n12-1/2 lb. ice. When thoroughly cold stir in 2-1/2 pints of sodium\r\nnitrite solution containing 3 lb. per gallon. Stir well for twenty\r\nminutes, then filter; add 4 lb. sodium acetate and sufficient ice-cold\r\nwater to make 13 gallons. Use this bath in the same way as the\r\nparanitroaniline bath.\r\n\r\n_Beta-naphthylamine Red._--This red is a good one, but is not so bright\r\nor so fast as the paranitroaniline red, hence although somewhat older in\r\npoint of time it is not dyed to the same extent. The developing bath is\r\nmade from 1-3/4 lb. beta-naphthylamine dissolved with the aid of 10\r\npints boiling water and 1 pint hydrochloric acid. When dissolved allow\r\nto cool; add 27 lb. ice and 2 pints hydrochloric acid. When cooled to\r\n32° to 36° Tw., add 3 pints sodium nitrite solution (3 lb. per gallon)\r\nand 4 lb. sodium acetate, making up to 13 gallons with water. This also\r\nis used in precisely the same way as the paranitroaniline red developing\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n_Alpha-Naphthylamine Claret._--This is a very fine and fairly fast red,\r\nand next to the paranitroaniline red may be considered the most\r\nimportant of the naphthol colours. The developing bath is a little more\r\ndifficult to make, owing to the fact that it is more difficult to get\r\nthe alpha-naphthylamine into solution. The best way of proceeding is the\r\nfollowing: Heat 1-3/4 lb. of alpha-naphthylamine in 10 pints of boiling\r\nwater, agitating well until the base is very finely divided in the\r\nwater, then 1-1/4 pints of hydrochloric acid is added, and the heat and\r\nstirring continued until the base is dissolved, then the mass is allowed\r\nto cool, 27 lb. of ice is added and 1-1/2 pints of hydrochloric acid.\r\nWhen cooled down to 32° to 36° F., there is added 3 pints sodium nitrite\r\nsolution (3 lb. per gallon), and after allowing the diazotisation to be\r\ncompleted, 4 lb. sodium acetate and sufficient water to make 13 gallons\r\nof liquor.\r\n\r\nThe bath is used in the same manner as the previous developing baths.\r\n\r\n_Dianisidine Blue._--Dianisidine develops with beta-naphthol, a violet\r\nblue, which is not very fast, but by the addition of some copper to the\r\ndeveloping bath a very fine blue is got which has a fair degree of\r\nfastness. The developing bath is made as follows: Mix 10-1/2 oz.\r\ndianisidine with 7 oz. hydrochloric acid and 7-1/2 pints of boiling\r\nwater, when complete solution is obtained it is allowed to cool, then 20\r\nlb. of ice is added. Next 1-3/4 pints of nitrite of soda solution,\r\ncontaining 1-1/2 lb. per gal. and 2-1/2 pints of cold water. Stir for\r\nthirty minutes, then add 1-1/4 pints copper chloride solution at 72°\r\nTw., and sufficient water to make up 6-1/2 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe cotton is prepared with beta-naphthol in the usual way, and then\r\npassed through this developing bath.\r\n\r\n_Amidoazotoluol Garnet._--Amidoazotoluol produces with beta-naphthol a\r\nfine garnet red in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe developing bath is made from 14 oz. amidoazotoluol, mixed with 1-1/2\r\npints of sodium nitrite solution containing 1-1/2 lb. per gallon, when\r\nwell mixed add 1 pint of hydrochloric acid diluted with 2 pints water,\r\nwhen this is well mixed add sufficient water to make up a gallon, then\r\nadd 1 lb. acetate of soda.\r\n\r\nThe cotton is passed through this dye-bath, then washed well, passed\r\nthrough a weak acid bath, then soaped well, washed and dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n(8) DYEING COTTON BY IMPREGNATION WITH DYE-STUFF SOLUTION.\r\n\r\nIndigo is a dye-stuff which requires special processes for its\r\napplication to the cotton or wool fibre.\r\n\r\nIts peculiarity is that in the form in which it comes to the dyer it is\r\ninsoluble in water, and to enable it to be dissolved and therefore to be\r\nused as a dye, the indigo has to go under a special treatment. The\r\ncolouring principle of indigo is a body named indigotin, to which the\r\nformula C{16}H{16}N{2}O{2} has been given. When indigo is mixed with\r\nsubstances like lime and copperas, lime and zinc, zinc and bisulphite of\r\nsoda, which cause the evolution of nascent hydrogen, it takes up this\r\nbody and passes into another substance which is called indigo white that\r\nhas the formula C{16}H{12}N{2}O{2}, leuco, or white indigo; this\r\nsubstance is soluble in water, and so when it is formed the indigo\r\npasses into solution and can then be used for dyeing. But indigo white\r\nis an unstable substance on exposure to air, the oxygen of the latter\r\nattacks the hydrogen which it has taken up, and indigotin is reformed,\r\nthe indigo white changing again into indigo blue.\r\n\r\nIndigo dyeing consists of three operations:--\r\n\r\n     (1) Preparation of the indigo solution, or, as it is called,\r\n     setting the dye vat. (2) Steeping the cotton in this vat. (3)\r\n     Exposing to the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Indigo Dye-vat for Cloth.]\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of preparing, or setting the dye vat, and of\r\neach of these modifications are in use in every indigo dye-house:--\r\n\r\n     (1) With lime and copperas. (2) Zinc and lime vat. (3) Zinc and\r\n     bisulphite of soda.\r\n\r\nIn all cases it is necessary for the indigo to be ground to the form of\r\na fine paste with water; this is usually done in what is known as the\r\nball-grinding mill. The finer it is ground the more easy is it to make\r\nthe dye-vats.\r\n\r\nThe dye-vats may be either round tubs or square wooden tanks; when\r\ncloths or warps are being dyed these may be fitted with winces and guide\r\nrollers, so as to draw the materials through the liquor. In the case of\r\nyarns in hanks these appliances are not necessary.\r\n\r\nFig. 30 is a sketch of an indigo dye-vat for cloth or warps.\r\n\r\n(1) =Lime and Copperas Vat.=--To prepare this vat take 75 gallons of\r\nwater, 4 lb. of indigo, 8 lb. copperas, and 10 lb. of good quicklime.\r\nPut these into the vat in the order shown. The amount of indigo is added\r\nin proportion to the shade which is required to be dyed: for pale\r\nshades, 2 lb. to 3 lb. will be sufficient; while for deep shades, 6 lb.\r\nto 7 lb. may be used. The amount of copperas should be from one and a\r\nhalf to twice that of the indigo. The vat should be stirred very well\r\nand then left to stand. The changes which occur are probably the\r\nfollowing: The lime acts upon the copperas and produces ferrous\r\nhydrate--this is unstable and tends to take up oxygen and hydrogen from\r\nthe water, particularly when there is some indigo present, and forms\r\nferric hydrate; hydrogen is at the same time liberated, and combines\r\nwith the indigo to form the soluble indigo white. It takes about\r\ntwenty-four hours to make an indigo vat. When properly made and in good\r\ncondition, the liquor will be clear and of a brownish-yellow colour, a\r\nbluish scum may collect on the surface. If the liquor appears at all\r\ngreenish it is an indication that the indigo has not been completely\r\nreduced, and the vat needs a further addition of lime and copperas,\r\nwhich should be of good quality. Too much of each should not be used,\r\nbecause with them there is formed at the bottom of the vat a sediment of\r\ncalcium sulphate and ferric hydrate, and it is not wise to increase this\r\nto too great an extent, which would be the case if too much lime and\r\ncopperas were added.\r\n\r\n_To Use this Vat._--Any scum on the surface is raked on one side, the\r\ncotton yarn immersed for a few minutes, then it is taken out, wrung,\r\nallowing the excess liquor to flow back into the vat, and the yarn hung\r\nup in the air for the blue to develop. The depth of shade which is dyed\r\ndepends chiefly upon the amount of indigo in the vat, and also upon the\r\ntime during which the hanks are dipped in the liquor. Light and medium\r\nshades can be readily and conveniently got by a single dip, but deep\r\nshades are best got by repeating the dipping once or twice as occasion\r\ndemands. Deep shades got by using a strong bath at a single dip are\r\nfound to rub badly, while by repeated dips the dye gets more into the\r\nsubstance of the fibre, and therefore the colour is more firmly fixed\r\nand it rubs less.\r\n\r\nSome indigo dyers have quite a range of vats, using those fresh made for\r\ndyeing deep shades, while the old vats being nearly exhausted are used\r\nonly for light shades and finally when completely exhausted are thrown\r\naway. After the day's work the vat should be stirred up and then allowed\r\nto stand. If necessary it may be strengthened by the addition of fresh\r\nquantities of indigo, lime and copperas, the next morning it will be\r\nready for use. Generally a lime-copperas vat will remain in good working\r\norder for about a month, when it will be necessary to throw it away.\r\n\r\n=(2) Zinc and Lime Vat.=--Zinc dust is a bye-product in the process of\r\nzinc extraction. It is a grey, very heavy powder, consisting mostly of\r\nfinely divided metallic zinc, with traces of oxide and sulphide of zinc.\r\nOf these only the metallic zinc is active in reducing the indigo, the\r\nrest of the ingredients are not of any consequence. The valuation of\r\nzinc dust is a very difficult operation, but it is desirable that this\r\nbe done, as the product is liable to be very variable in the proportion\r\nof actual zinc it contains, and it will pay large buyers always to have\r\nit tested. Zinc dust must always be kept in a dry place.\r\n\r\nFor the reduction of zinc powder lime is chiefly used. The following are\r\ntwo good mixtures.\r\n\r\nVat with zinc and lime:--\r\n\r\n10 lb. indigo, dry and ground fine;\r\n5-1/2 lb. zinc dust;\r\n22 lb. slaked lime, dry.\r\n\r\nThe vat is set as follows, a part of the lime is mixed with the indigo,\r\nand the two bodies are well mixed together and allowed to stand for ten\r\nminutes, then the zinc powder is added. It is best to make this into a\r\nsmooth paste with water before adding it to the other ingredients, then\r\nthe rest of the lime is added and the whole is thoroughly stirred\r\ntogether with the necessary quantity of water.\r\n\r\nVat with zinc powder, lime and soda:--\r\n\r\n10 lb. indigo, dry and ground fine;\r\n10 lb. zinc powder;\r\n10 lb. slaked lime, dry;\r\n35 lb. caustic soda at 11° Tw.\r\n\r\nAdd the lime to the ground indigo, then add the zinc and finally the\r\nsoda lye.\r\n\r\nSoon after the various ingredients of the vats are added together the\r\nwhole mass becomes hot, when it must be well stirred. It soon begins to\r\nevolve gas and the mixture froths. In from two to four hours the\r\nevolution of gas ceases. The dark blue solution now becomes yellow and\r\nthe liquor shows all the characteristics of the indigo vat. It is\r\nnecessary to keep the vat well stirred up during the time of setting,\r\nwhich takes from five to six hours. If there is much evolution of gas\r\nafter this time it indicates that too much zinc powder has been added;\r\nthis is a common fault with dyers, and such excess causes the vat to be\r\ntoo much disturbed and to work dirty. A lime-zinc vat, with occasional\r\nadditions of new materials, keeps good for three months, and even then\r\nis in a better condition than the copperas vat.\r\n\r\nThis vat is used in precisely the same way as the copperas vat; as it\r\ncontains no sediment, or but little, it works cleaner than the copperas\r\nvat and as a rule the indigo blues dyed in it are faster to rubbing.\r\n\r\nAfter a day's work it can be well stirred up and fresh additions of\r\nlime, zinc and indigo made to bring it up to its original dyeing\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n=(3) Zinc-Bisulphite Indigo Vat.=--When zinc dust and bisulphite of soda\r\nare mixed together a reaction sets in, the zinc dissolves, and there is\r\nformed sodium hydrosulphite and zinc and sodium sulphites. If now indigo\r\nis mixed with this solution the sodium hydrosulphite exerts a reducing\r\naction on it, forming white indigo and sodium sulphite, a perfectly\r\nclear solution being obtained, which may be used in dyeing cotton or\r\nwool.\r\n\r\nWith this vat it is customary to prepare a strong stock solution of\r\nreduced indigo, and to add this to the dyeing vats as may be required.\r\n\r\n_To Make the Stock Liquor._--Take 20 lb. of indigo, grind into a paste\r\nwith 20 gallons of boiled water, then add 25 lb. lime slaked into a\r\nmilk. In a separate tub there is mixed 80 lb. bisulphite of soda, 70°\r\nTw., with 9 lb. zinc dust; this mixture is well stirred and every care\r\ntaken to prevent it getting hot. When the zinc has dissolved and the\r\nmixture is free from any sulphurous smell it is run into the indigo\r\nmixture given above. The whole is well stirred together for some time,\r\nand then at intervals, until the indigo has become dissolved, sufficient\r\nwater is added to make up 50 gallons, when the stock liquor will be\r\nready. It should have a deep yellow colour. The surface may have a scum\r\nof a bronzy colour collect on it. This stock liquor should be kept in\r\ncasks free from exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nTo make the working vat from this stock liquor the following is the\r\nmethod of proceeding:--\r\n\r\nWater is run into the vat, and this is heated from 70° to 80° C. in\r\norder to expel air from it, after which it may be allowed to cool, then\r\nfor each 1,000 gallons contained in the vat there is added 30 lb.\r\nbisulphite of soda, 3 lb. zinc dust and 3 lb. lime, made into a cream.\r\nWhen all these ingredients are dissolved a quantity of the stock liquor\r\nis added in proportion to the shade that it is desired to dye. The whole\r\nis well stirred, then the vat is allowed to rest for half an hour to\r\nenable any sediment to settle, and then the dyeing is proceeded with.\r\n\r\nShould the vat show signs of becoming green in colour it is a good plan\r\nto add a mixture of 1 lb. zinc dust and 10 lb. bisulphite of soda. The\r\nvat should be kept alkaline, and so a little lime may be added from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\nAfter a day's work it is well to add a little of the zinc and bisulphite\r\nmixture, to stir well and allow to stand overnight; the next morning\r\nstrengthen up the vat by adding fresh stock liquor.\r\n\r\nIn place of using lime in making up the vat it is possible to use a\r\nmixture of caustic soda and ammonia. The lime will tend to cause some\r\nsediment to form in the vat, whereas the soda and ammonia will not. When\r\nthey are used the following mode of working may be followed:--\r\n\r\n_Stock Liquor._--Soda zinc vat: Put in a tub 26 gallons cold water, 15\r\nlb. zinc powder ground into a paste with 6 gallons water, then stir in 8\r\ngallons bisulphite of soda at 60° Tw., stir well, keeping the heat down\r\nas much as possible, after which add 8 pints caustic soda lye at 70° Tw.\r\nand 14 pints 20 per cent. liquor ammonia. When all is thoroughly mixed\r\nadd 30 lb. indigo, ground into a paste with 7 gallons water, allow to\r\nstand for half an hour, then add water to make 100 gallons, stir at\r\nintervals for twelve hours or so, when the stock liquor will be ready\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nThis is used to make the vat in the same way as the first above\r\ndescribed. It is needful before adding the stock liquor in making a vat\r\nto destroy any oxygen or air which is present in the vat. This may most\r\nconveniently be done by adding thereto a solution of hydrosulphite of\r\nsoda, which may be made by mixing 4-1/2 lb. zinc dust with 5 gallons of\r\nwater and 3 gallons bisulphite of soda at 70° Tw., stirring well, so\r\nthat the temperature does not rise too high, there is then added 2 pints\r\ncaustic soda and 3 pints liquor ammonia, 20 per cent.; when all is\r\ndissolved, water is added to make up 13 gallons.\r\n\r\nShould the vat show signs of becoming charged with indigo, indicated by\r\nits becoming of a green colour, a little of this hydrosulphite added\r\nfrom time to time will correct it.\r\n\r\nThe hydrosulphite-indigo vat made by either of the two methods indicated\r\nabove works well, and with due care may be kept in work for months. It\r\ngives good shades of indigo, although some dyers consider that these\r\nhave not the rich bronze hue got from the lime and copperas vat. The\r\nshades are rather faster to rubbing.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to employ the dye-stuff indophenol in conjunction\r\nwith indigo, in which case the method of making the vat is with zinc,\r\nbisulphite of soda, caustic soda and ammonia as last described, only in\r\nplace of using all indigo a mixture of 22 lb. indigo and 7-1/2 lb.\r\nindophenol is used. Good blue shades of considerable fastness can thus\r\nbe got.\r\n\r\n_Aniline Black._--This black is produced direct upon the cotton fibre by\r\nvarious processes which entail the oxidation of aniline. The chemical\r\ncomposition and constitution of aniline black has not yet been worked\r\nout. It is not by any means an easy colour to dye, but still with\r\ncareful attention to carrying out the various operations in detail\r\nexcellent results can be attained.\r\n\r\nAniline black is the fastest black which is known, it resists when well\r\ndyed exposure to air and light, is quite fast to washing and soaping.\r\nIts disadvantages are that there is, with some methods of working, a\r\ntendency to tender the cotton fibre, making it tear easily; secondly, on\r\nexposure to air it tends to turn green, this however only happens when\r\nthe black has not been dyed properly.\r\n\r\nAt the present day it is perhaps without doubt the most used of all\r\nblacks. The methods for producing it are many and varied, the following\r\nrecipes show how some of the finest aniline blacks can be dyed:--\r\n\r\nUngreenable black is formed when the aniline is by the action of the\r\noxidising agents converted into a substance named nigraniline. This\r\ncompound when formed will not turn green on the fibre under the\r\ninfluence of acids.\r\n\r\n1. The most usual oxidising agent employed for dyeing aniline black is\r\nbichromate of soda, which salt will be found much better for all\r\npurposes than bichromate of potash. Two separate solutions are prepared:\r\n(1) 61 lb. aniline, 9 lb. hydrochloric acid and 10 gallons of water; and\r\n(2) 12 lb. bichromate of soda and 20 gallons of water. After cooling,\r\nequal quantities of these solutions are mixed and the cotton worked\r\nrapidly through the mixture, in a few minutes it assumes a bronze black.\r\nThe material is then wrung out and steamed for twenty minutes at 3-1/2\r\nlb. pressure, which process renders it jet black and also ungreenable.\r\n\r\n2. Another aniline black: For 100 lb. cotton use 11 lb. aniline oil, 15\r\nlb. bichromate of soda, 40 lb. hydrochloric acid and 160 gallons water\r\nor 12 lb. sulphuric acid. The dye-bath is filled with the water and the\r\ncold solution of aniline oil and a part of the hydrochloric acid in\r\nwater is first added, afterwards the bichromate is dissolved in a small\r\nquantity of water, working cold at first and gradually rising to the\r\nboil.\r\n\r\n3. Another method is the following and gives a black that is fast and\r\nungreenable and will not rub: 10 lb. chlorate of soda, 10 lb. ammonium\r\nchloride, 10 lb. copper sulphate, 35 lb. aniline salt, 101 lb. aniline\r\noil and 20 gallons water. The sodium chlorate and ammonium chloride are\r\ndissolved in 6-1/2 gallons and the copper sulphate separately in 5-1/2\r\ngallons water. The aniline salt is dissolved in as little hot water as\r\npossible and neutralised with a small amount of aniline oil (10 lb.).\r\nThe solution of aniline salt is first added to the bath, then the sodium\r\nchlorate and ammonium chloride, and lastly the copper sulphate, dilute\r\nthe whole to 14° Tw. and then enter the goods. Next steam, then run\r\nthrough a solution containing 10 lb. bichromate and 5 lb. soda per 100\r\ngallons water at 160° F., after which the goods are washed and dry\r\nsteamed at 15 lb. pressure.\r\n\r\n4. A very good black is the prussiate or steam aniline black whose\r\ncheapness should recommend it. Prepare concentrated solutions of 1-3/4\r\nlb. aniline salt in 1 gallon water, 1-1/2 lb. ferrocyanide of potash in\r\n3/4 gallons water and 1-1/2 lb. potassium chlorate in 1-1/2 gallons\r\nwater. Mix the solutions and work in a jigger, then steam in a Mather &\r\nPlatt apparatus for two minutes, then work hot in a jigger in a solution\r\nof 2 lb. bichromate per 50 gallons water, dry and finish.\r\n\r\nEither of these methods yields a good full black; with a little\r\nexperience and care perfectly uniform shades will be got.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDYEING UNION (MIXED COTTON AND WOOL) FABRICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is now produced a great variety of textile fabrics of every\r\nconceivable texture by combining the two fibres, cotton and wool, in a\r\nnumber of ways; the variety of these fabrics has of late years\r\nconsiderably increased, which increase may be largely ascribed to the\r\nintroduction of the direct dyeing colouring matters--the Diamine dyes,\r\nthe Benzo dyes, the Congo and the Zambesi dyes, for in the dyeing of\r\nwool-cotton fabrics they have made a revolution. The dyer of union\r\nfabrics, that is, fabrics composed of wool and cotton, was formerly put\r\nto great straits to obtain uniform shades on the fabrics supplied to\r\nhim, owing to the difference in the affinity of the two fibres for the\r\ndye-stuffs then known. Now the direct dyes afford him a means of easily\r\ndyeing a piece of cotton-wool cloth in any colour of a uniform shade,\r\nwhile the production of two coloured effects is much more under his\r\ncontrol, and has led to the increased production of figured-dress\r\nfabrics, with the ground in one fibre (wool) and colour, and the design\r\nin another fibre (cotton) and colour. The number of direct dyes issued\r\nby the various colour manufacturers is so great that it would take a\r\nfairly considerable space to discuss them all.\r\n\r\nTo obtain good results it is needful that the dyer of union fabrics\r\nshould have a thorough knowledge of the dyes he is using, for each dye\r\nmakes a rule to itself as regards its power of dyeing wool and\r\ncotton--some go better on to the cotton than on to the wool, and _vice\r\nversa_. Some dye wool best at the boil, others equally well below that\r\nheat; some go on the cotton at a moderate temperature, others require\r\nthe dye-bath to be boiling; some will go on to the cotton only, and\r\nappear to ignore the wool.\r\n\r\nThe presence or absence in the dye-bath of such bodies as carbonate of\r\nsoda, Glauber's salt, etc., has a material influence on the degree of\r\nthe affinity of the dye-stuff for the two fibres, as will perhaps be\r\nnoted hereafter. Again, while some of the dyes produce equal colours on\r\nboth fibres, there are others where the tone is different. With all\r\nthese peculiarities of the Diamine and other direct dyes the union dyer\r\nmust make himself familiar. These dyes are used in neutral baths, that\r\nis, along with the dye-stuff. It is often convenient to use, along with\r\nthe direct dyes, some azo or acid dyes, which have the property of\r\ndyeing the wool from neutral baths, many examples of such will be found\r\nin the practical recipes given below. The dyes now under consideration\r\nmay be conveniently classed into five groups.\r\n\r\n1. Those dyes which dye the cotton and wool from the same bath to the\r\nsame shade, or nearly so. Among such are Thioflavine S, Diamine fast\r\nyellow B, Diamine orange B, Diamine rose B D, Diamine reds 4 B, 5 B, 6 B\r\nand 10 B, Diamine fast red F, Diamine Bordeaux B, Diamine brown N,\r\nDiamine browns 3 G, B and G, Diamine blues R W, B X, Diamine blue G,\r\nDiamine greens G and B, Diamine black H W, Diamine dark blue B, Union\r\nblacks B and S, Oxydiamine blacks B, M, D and A, Diamine catechine G,\r\nUnion blue B B, Oxyphenine, Chloramine yellow, Alkali yellow R, Chromine\r\nG, Titan scarlet S, Mimosa, Curcumine, Primuline, Auroline, Congo\r\nCorinth B, Thiazole yellow, Columbia yellow, Oxydiamine yellow G G,\r\nOxydiamine oranges G and R, Diamine orange F, Oxydiamine red S.\r\n\r\n2. Dyes which dye the cotton a deeper shade than the wool. The\r\nfollowing belong to this group: Diamine fast yellow A, Diamine oranges G\r\nand D, Diamine catechine G, Diamine catechine B, Diamine sky blue,\r\nDiamine blue 2 B, Diamine blue 8 B, Diamine blue B G, Diamine brilliant\r\nblue G, Diamine new blue R, Diamine steel blue L, Diamine black R O,\r\nDiamine black B 0, Diamine black B H, and Oxydiamine black S O O O,\r\nDiamine nitrazol brown G, Diamine sky blue F F, Diamine dark blue B,\r\nDiamine Bordeaux B, Diamine violet N, Oxydiamine violet B, Columbia\r\nblacks B and F B, Zambesi black B, Congo brown G, Direct yellow G,\r\nDirect orange B, Clayton yellow, Cotton yellow, orange T A, Benzo\r\npurpurine B, Brilliant Congo R, Chicago blues B and 4 B and 6 B.\r\n\r\n3. Dyes which dye wool a deeper shade than the cotton. The dyes in this\r\ngroup are not numerous. They are Diamine gold, Diamine scarlet B,\r\nDiamine scarlet 3 B, Diamine Bordeaux S, Diamine blue R W, and Diamine\r\ngreen G, Diamine reds N 0 and B, Chicago blues G and R, Brilliant\r\npurpurine R, Diamine scarlet B, Delta purpurine 5 B, Chrysamine, Titan\r\nblue, Titan pink, Congo oranges G and R, Erie blue 2 G, Congo R,\r\nBrilliant Congo R, Erika B N, Benzo purpurines 4 B and 10 B,\r\nChrysophenine, Titan yellow, Titan browns Y, R and O, Congo brown G,\r\nSulphon azurine B, Zambesi black B.\r\n\r\n4. Dyes which produce different shades on the two fibres. Diamine brown\r\nG, and Diamine blue 3 R, Diamine brown V, Diamine brown S, Diamine\r\nnitrazol brown B, Diamine blues B X and 3 R, Diamine blue black E, Benzo\r\nblue black G, Benzo purpurine 10 B, Benzo azurines R, G and 3 G,\r\nColumbia red S, Brilliant azurine 5 G, Titan marine blue, Congo Corinths\r\nG and B, Azo blue, Hessian violet, Titan blue, Azo mauve, Congo brown,\r\nDiamine bronze G, Zambesi browns G and 2 G, Zambesi black F.\r\n\r\n5. Azo-acid dyes, which dye wool from neutral baths, and are therefore\r\nsuitable for shading up the wool to the cotton in union fabric dyeing.\r\nAmong the dyes thus available may be enumerated: Naphthol blues G and R,\r\nNaphthol blue black, Formyl violet 10 B, Lanacyl blue B B, Lanacyl blue\r\nR, Alkaline blue, Formyl violets S 4 B and 6 B, Rocceleine, Azo red A,\r\nCroceine A Z, Brilliant scarlet, Orange extra, Orange E N Z, Indian\r\nyellow G, Indian yellow R, Tropæoline O O, Naphthylamine black 4 B and\r\nNaphthol blue black, Brilliant scarlet G, Lanacyl violet B, Brilliant\r\nmilling green B, Thiocarmine R, Formyl blue B, Naphthylamine blacks D, 4\r\nB and 6 B; Azo-acid yellow, Curcumine extra, Mandarine G, Ponceau 3 R B,\r\nAcid violet 6 B, Guinea violet 4 B, Guinea green B, Wool black 6 B.\r\n\r\nRegarding the best methods of dyeing, that in neutral baths yields the\r\nmost satisfactory results in practical working. It is done in a boiling\r\nhot or in a slightly boiling bath, with the addition of 6-1/4 oz.\r\ncrystallised Glauber's salt per gallon water for the first bath, and\r\nwhen the baths are kept standing 20 per cent. crystallised Glauber's\r\nsalt, reckoned upon the weight of the goods, for each succeeding lot.\r\n\r\nIn dyeing unions, the dye-baths must be as concentrated as possible, and\r\nmust not contain more than from 25 to 30 times as much water as the\r\ngoods weigh. In this respect it may serve as a guide that concentrated\r\nbaths are best used when dyeing dark shades, while light shades can be\r\ndyed in more diluted baths. The most important factor for producing\r\nuniform dyeings is the appropriate regulation of the temperature of the\r\ndye-bath. Concerning this, the dyer must bear in mind that the direct\r\ncolours possess a greater affinity for the cotton if dyed below the\r\nboiling point, and only go on the wool when the bath is boiling,\r\nespecially so the longer and more intensely the goods are boiled.\r\n\r\nThe following method of dyeing is perhaps the best one: Charge the\r\ndye-bath with the requisite dye-stuff and Glauber's salt, boil up, shut\r\noff the steam, enter the goods and let run for half an hour without\r\nsteam, then sample. If the shade of both cotton and wool is too light\r\nadd some more of the dye-stuffs used for both fibres, boil up once more\r\nand boil for a quarter to half an hour. If the wool only is too light,\r\nor its shade different from that of the cotton, add some more of the\r\ndye-stuff used for shading the wool and bring them again to the boil.\r\nIf, however, the cotton turns out too light, or does not correspond in\r\nshade to the wool, add some more of the dye-stuffs used for dyeing the\r\ncotton, without, however, raising the temperature. Prolonged boiling is\r\nonly necessary very rarely, and generally only if the goods to be dyed\r\nare difficult to penetrate, or contain qualities of wool which only with\r\ndifficulty take up the dye-stuff. In such cases, in making up the bath\r\ndye-stuffs are to be selected some of which go only on the wool and\r\nothers which go only on the cotton (those belonging to the second\r\ngroup).\r\n\r\nThe goods can then be boiled for some time, and perfect penetration and\r\nlevel shades will result. If the wool takes up the dye-stuff easily (as\r\nis frequently the case with goods manufactured from shoddy), and are\r\ntherefore dyed too dark a shade, then dye-stuffs have to be used which\r\nprincipally dye the cotton, and a too high temperature should be\r\navoided. In such cases it is advisable to diminish the affinity of the\r\nwool by the addition of one-fifth of the original quantity of Glauber's\r\nsalt (about 3/8 oz. per gallon water), and from three-quarters to\r\nfour-fifths of the dye-stuff used for the first lot. Care has to be\r\ntaken that not much of the dye liquor is lost when taking out the dyed\r\ngoods, otherwise the quantities of Glauber's salt and dye-stuff will\r\nhave to be increased proportionately. Wooden vats, such as are generally\r\nused for piece dyeing, have proved the most suitable. They are heated\r\nwith direct, or, still better, with indirect steam. The method which has\r\nproved most advantageous is to let the steam run into a space separated\r\nfrom the vat by a perforated wall, into which space the required\r\ndye-stuffs and salt are placed.\r\n\r\nThe mode of working is rather influenced by the character of the goods,\r\nand the following notes will be found useful by the union dyer:--\r\n\r\nVery little difficulty will be met with in dyeing such light fabrics as\r\nItalians, cashmere, serges and similar thin textiles lightly woven from\r\ncotton warp and woollen weft. When deep shades (blacks, dark blues,\r\nbrowns and greens), are being dyed it is not advisable to make up the\r\ndye-bath with the whole of the dyes at once. It is much better to add\r\nthese in quantities of about one-fourth at a time at intervals during\r\nthe dyeing of the piece. It is found that the affinity of the wool for\r\nthe dyes at the boil is so much greater than is that of the cotton that\r\nit would, if the whole of the dye were used, take up too much of the\r\ncolour, and then would come up too deep in shade. Never give a strong\r\nboil with such fabrics, but keep the bath just under the boil, which\r\nresults in the wool dyeing much more nearly like to cotton.\r\n\r\n_Bright Yellow._--Use 2 lb. Thioflavine S in a bath which contains 4 lb.\r\nGlauber's salt per 10 gallons of dye liquor.\r\n\r\n_Good Yellow._--A very fine deep shade is dyed with 2-1/2 lb. Diamine\r\ngold and 2-1/2 lb. Diamine fast yellow A, in the same way as the last.\r\nHere advantage is taken of the fact that while the Diamine gold dyes the\r\nwool better than the cotton, the yellow dyes the cotton the deeper\r\nshade, and between the two a uniform shade of yellow is got.\r\n\r\n_Pale Gold Yellow._--Use a dye liquor containing 4 lb. Glauber's salt in\r\nevery 10 gallons, 2-1/2 lb. Diamine fast yellow A, 2 oz. Indian yellow G\r\nand 3-1/2 oz. Indian yellow R. In this recipe there is used in the two\r\nlast dyes purely wool yellows, which dye the wool the same tint as the\r\nfast yellow A dyes the cotton.\r\n\r\n_Bright Yellow._--Use in the same way as the last, 2-1/2 lb. Diamine\r\nfast yellow B and 3 oz. Indian yellow G.\r\n\r\n_Gold Orange._--Use as above 2 lb. Diamine orange G, 5-1/2 oz. Indian\r\nyellow K and 1-1/2 oz. Orange E N Z.\r\n\r\n_Deep Orange._--Use 2-1/2 lb. Diamine orange D C, 6-1/2 oz. Orange E N\r\nZ, and 3-1/4 oz. Indian yellow R.\r\n\r\n_Black._--Use 4-1/2 lb. Union black S, 2 oz. Diamine fast yellow A, 5\r\noz. Naphthol blue black and 3-1/4 oz. Formyl violet S 4 B, with 4 lb.\r\nGlauber's salt in each 10 gallons dye liquor.\r\n\r\n_Navy Blue._--Use 1-1/4 lb. Union black S, 3 lb. Diamine black B H, 1/2\r\noz. Naphthol blue black, 1/2 lb. Formyl violet S 4 B and 2-1/2 oz.\r\nalkaline blue B.\r\n\r\n_Red Plum._--Use a dye-bath containing 2-1/2 lb. Oxydiamine violet B and\r\n3-1/4 oz. Formyl violet S 4 B.\r\n\r\n_Dark Green._--A fine shade can be dyed in a bath containing 3 lb.\r\nDiamine green B and 1-1/2 lb. Diamine black H W.\r\n\r\n_Dark Slate._--Use 4 lb. Diamine black H W, 2 oz. Naphthol blue black\r\nand 3 oz. Azo red A.\r\n\r\n_Sage._--Use a dye-bath containing 4 lb. Diamine bronze G and 1-1/4 oz.\r\nNaphthol blue black.\r\n\r\n_Dark Brown._--A fine dark shade is got from 2-1/2 lb. Diamine brown V\r\nand 2 oz. Naphthol blue black.\r\n\r\n_Peacock Green._--Use 3-3/4 lb. Diamine steel blue L, 13 oz. Diamine\r\nfast yellow B, 14-1/2 oz. Thiocarmine K and 2-1/4 oz. Indian yellow G in\r\na bath of 4 lb. Glauber's salt per gallon dye liquor.\r\n\r\n_Dark Sea Green._--Use 9 oz. Diamine steel blue L, 3-3/4 oz. Diamine\r\nfast yellow B, 1/2 oz. Diamine orange G, 1-1/4 oz. Naphthol blue black\r\nand 3/4 oz. Indian yellow G.\r\n\r\n_Dark Brown._--Use 1 lb. Diamine orange B, 1 lb. Diamine Fast yellow S,\r\n13-3/4 oz. Union black S, 1 lb. Diamine brown M and 1/2 lb. Indian\r\nyellow G. Fix in an alum bath after dyeing.\r\n\r\n_Dark Stone._--Use 1/2 lb. Diamine orange B, 3-3/4 oz. Union black, 1/4\r\noz. Diamine Bordeaux B, 1-1/2 oz. Azo red A and 3/4 oz. Naphthol blue\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n_Black._--A very fine black can be got from 3-1/2 lb. Oxydiamine black B\r\nM, 2 lb. Union black S, 9-1/2 oz. Naphthol blue black and 4 oz. Formyl\r\nviolet S 4 B.\r\n\r\n_Dark Grey._--A fine bluish shade of grey is got from 7 oz. Diamine\r\nblack B H, 2-1/4 oz. Diamine orange G, 2-1/2 oz. Diamine orange G, 2-1/2\r\noz. Naphthol blue black and 1 oz. Orange E N Z.\r\n\r\n_Dark Blue._--A fine shade is got by using 2 lb. Diamine black B H, 1/2\r\nlb. Diamine black H W, and 3-1/2 oz.

Glauber's\r\nsalt, and the working at the boil continued for one hour, at the end of\r\nwhich time the dye-bath will be fairly well exhausted of colour. The\r\ngoods are now taken out and put into a fixing-bath of sumac or tannin,\r\nin which they are treated for fifteen minutes; to this same bath there\r\nis next added tartar emetic and 1 lb. sulphuric acid, and the working\r\ncontinued for a quarter of an hour, then the bath is heated to 160° F.,\r\nwhen the goods are lifted, rinsed and dried. In the recipes the\r\nquantities of the dyes, sumac or tannin and tartar emetic are given\r\nonly, the other ingredients and processes are the same in all.\r\n\r\n_Dark Blue._--2-1/4 lb.

After weaving and cleansing the woollen part of\r\nthe fabric was dyed with acid dyes, such as Acid magenta, Scarlet R,\r\nAcid yellow, etc. In such methods care has to be taken that the dyes\r\nused for dyeing the cotton are such as stand acids, a by no means easy\r\ncondition to fulfil at one time. Many of the direct dyes are fast to\r\nacids and, therefore, lend themselves more or less readily to cross\r\ndyeing. For details of the dyes for cotton reference may be made to the\r\nsections on dyeing with the direct colours, page 85, etc., while\r\ninformation as to methods of dyeing the wool will be found in the\r\ncompanion volume to this on _Dyeing of Woollen Fabrics_.\r\n\r\n=Shot Effects.=--A pleasing kind of textile fabric which is now made,\r\nand is a great favourite for ladies' dress goods, is where the cotton of\r\na mixed fabric is thrown up to form a figured design. It is possible to\r\ndye the two fibres in different colours, and so produce a variety of\r\nshot effects. These latter are so endless that it is impossible here to\r\nenumerate all that may be produced. It will have to suffice to lay down\r\nthe lines which may be followed to the best advantage, and then give\r\nsome recipes to illustrate the remarks that have been made. The best\r\nplan for the production of shot effects upon union fabrics is to take\r\nadvantage of the property of certain acid dyes which dye only the wool\r\nin an acid bath, and of many of the direct colours which will only dye\r\nthe cotton in an alkaline bath. The process, working on these lines,\r\nbecomes as follows: The wool is first dyed in an acid bath with the\r\naddition of Glauber's salt and bisulphate of soda, or sulphuric acid,\r\nthe goods are then washed with water containing a little ammonia to free\r\nthem from the acid, and afterwards dyed with the direct colour in an\r\nalkaline bath.\r\n\r\nFancy or the mode shades are obtained by combining suitable dye-stuffs.\r\n\r\nIf the cotton is to be dyed in light shades it is advantageous to dye on\r\nthe liquor at 65° to 80° F., with the addition of 3-1/4 oz. Glauber's\r\nsalt, and from 20 to 40 grains borax per gallon water. The addition of\r\nan alkali is advisable in order to neutralise any slight quantities of\r\nacid which may have remained in the wool, and to prevent the dye-stuff\r\nfrom dyeing the cotton too deep a shade.\r\n\r\nVery light shades can also be done on the padding machine. The\r\ndye-stuffs of Group II., which have been previously enumerated, do not\r\nstain the wool at all, or only very slightly, and are, therefore, the\r\nmost suitable. Less bright effects can be produced by simply dyeing the\r\ngoods in one bath. The wool is first dyed at the boil with the\r\nrespective wool dye-stuff in a neutral bath, the steam is then shut off\r\nand the cotton dyed by adding the cotton dye-stuff to the bath, and\r\ndyeing without again heating. By passing the goods through cold water to\r\nwhich some sulphuric or acetic acid is added, the brightness of most\r\neffects is greatly increased.\r\n\r\n_Gold and Green._--First bath, 1 lb. Cyanole extra, 7-1/4 oz. Acid\r\ngreen, 1-1/2 oz. Orange G G, and 10 lb. bisulphate of soda; work at the\r\nboil for one hour, then lift and rinse well. Second bath, 4 lb. Diamine\r\norange G and 15 lb. Glauber's salt; work in the cold or at a lukewarm\r\nheat. Third bath, at 120° F., 4 oz. Chrysoidine and 1/4 oz. Safranine.\r\n\r\n_Black and Blue._--First bath, 3-1/2 lb. Naphthol black 3 B and 10 lb.\r\nbisulphate of soda. Second bath, 2 lb. Diamine sky blue and 13 lb.\r\nGlauber's salt. Third bath, 6-1/2 oz.

Orange\r\nE N Z, 1-1/2 oz. Cyanole extra and 10 lb. bisulphate of soda. Second\r\nbath, 12 oz. Diamine sky blue F F and 15 lb. Glauber's salt.\r\n\r\n_Black and Green Blue._--First bath, 3 lb. Orange G G, 1 lb. Brilliant\r\ncochineal 4 R, 1 lb. Fast acid green B N and 10 lb. Glauber's salt.\r\nSecond bath, 1-3/4 lb. Diamine sky blue F F, 3-1/4 lb. Thioflavine S and\r\n15 lb. Glauber's salt.\r\n\r\nWe may here note that in all the above recipes the second bath (for\r\ndying the cotton) should be used cold or at lukewarm heat and as strong\r\nas possible. It is not completely exhausted of colour, only about\r\none-half going on the fibre. If kept as a standing bath this feature\r\nshould be borne in mind, and less dye-stuff used in the dyeing of the\r\nsecond and following lots of goods.\r\n\r\n_Blue and Gold Yellow._--3 lb. Diamine orange G, 13 oz. Naphthol blue G,\r\n14-1/2 oz. Formyl violet S 4 B and 15 lb. Glauber's salt. Work at just\r\nunder the boil.\r\n\r\n_Brown and Blue._--1 lb. Diamine steel blue L, 9-1/2 oz.

Work at 170° to 180° F.\r\n\r\nIn these two last recipes only one bath is used, all the dyes being\r\nadded at once. This is possible if care be taken that dye-stuffs of two\r\nkinds are used, one or more which will dye wool and not cotton from\r\nneutral baths, and those direct dyes which dye cotton better than wool.\r\nThe temperature should also be kept below the boil and carefully\r\nregulated as the operation proceeds and the results begin to show\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n_Grey and Orange._--First bath, 3 oz. Orange extra, 1-1/4 lb. Cyanole\r\nextra, 1 lb. Azo red A and 10 lb. bisulphate of soda. Second bath, 5 oz.\r\nDiamine orange D C and 3 oz.

For details of the method of\r\napplying acid dyes to silk reference may be made to Mr. G.H. Hurst's\r\nbook on _Silk Dyeing_.\r\n\r\nMost of the direct colours are exceedingly well adapted for this\r\npurpose, some under certain conditions possess the property of dyeing\r\nthe cotton a deeper shade than the silk, which is an advantage rather\r\nthan otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing of goods composed of silk and cotton is generally done in\r\nwinch dye-vats, in some cases also on the jigger.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DYEING.\r\n\r\nThe direct colours are as a rule dyed in a soap-bath with addition of\r\nphosphate of soda, Glauber's salt or common salt and a little soda.\r\n\r\nThe addition of these salts effects a better exhaustion of the baths;\r\nthey are therefore principally used for dark and full shades, whilst\r\npale shades are dyed with the addition of soap only or in combination\r\nwith phosphate of soda. Dark or pale shades may thus be produced at will\r\nby selecting the proper additions, but the fact should not be\r\noverlooked that the greater exhaustion of the baths not only increases\r\nthe depth of shade of the cotton but also causes the silk to absorb more\r\ndye-stuff. Too large a proportion of salt would cause the dye-stuffs to\r\ngo on the fibre too quickly and thus make the dyeing liable to turn out\r\nuneven.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of soap counteracts the effects of the salts, causing\r\nthe dye-stuff to go on less quickly and tending to leave the silk\r\nlighter than the cotton, in some cases even almost white, a property\r\nwhich is valuable in many cases, especially as enabling the silk and\r\ncotton to be dyed in different colours to obtain shot effects.\r\n\r\nIt is thus obvious that a general method applicable in all cases cannot\r\nbe given; it will vary according to the effect desired, and partly also\r\ndepend on the material to be dyed.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars may serve as a guide for the first bath:--\r\n\r\nFor pale shades each 10 gallons dye-liquor should contain 3-1/4 to 6-1/2\r\noz. soap and 4 to 7 drs. soda or 3-1/4 to 6-1/2 oz. soap, 4 to 5-1/2\r\ndrs. soda and 3-1/4 to 6-1/2 oz. phosphate of soda.\r\n\r\nFor medium and dark shades each 10 gallons dye-liquor may contain 3-1/4\r\nto 6-1/2 oz. soap, 4 to 7 drs. soda, 3-1/4 to 6-1/2 oz. phosphate of\r\nsoda and 6-1/2 to 13 oz. cryst. Glauber's salt.\r\n\r\nFor two coloured effects or dyeings, in which the silk is intended to\r\nremain as pale as possible or even white, each 10 gallons dye-liquor may\r\ncontain 4-3/4 to 8 oz. soap, 4 to 6 drs. soda, 3-1/4 to 8 oz. phosphate\r\nof soda and 4-3/4 to 9-1/2 oz. cryst. Glauber's salt.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the dye-baths is generally 175° to 195° F.; in\r\npractical dyeing it is usual to boil up the fully charged dye-bath, shut\r\noff the steam, enter the goods and dye for about three-quarters of an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nFor obtaining level dyeings in pale shades it is advisable not to enter\r\nthe goods too hot, but to raise the temperature gradually. Raising the\r\ntemperature, or dyeing for some time at the boil will deepen the shade\r\nof the cotton, but at the same time will have the same effect on the\r\nsilk which may sometimes be an advantage when dyeing dark shades.\r\n\r\nAs a complete exhaustion of the baths does not take place, especially\r\nwhen dyeing dark shades, it is advantageous, nay, even imperative, to\r\npreserve the baths for further use, they are then replenished with only\r\nabout three-fourths of the quantities of dye-stuffs used for the first\r\nbath, of the soap only about one fourth, of Glauber's salt, soda and\r\nphosphate of soda only about one-fifth, of the first quantities are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe first bath should be prepared with condensed water. If none is at\r\nhand ordinary water should be boiled up with soda and soap and the scum\r\nremoved. Clear soap baths are absolutely necessary for the production of\r\npure shades and clean pieces.\r\n\r\nAfter dyeing, the pieces must be very well rinsed, and the colour raised\r\nor brightened with 1 pint of acetic acid in 10 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nMany of the Diamine and Titan colours being very fast to acids, but few\r\nof them will be affected by this treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the following tables are given those Diamine, etc., colours\r\nespecially adapted for the dyeing of goods composed of silk and cotton,\r\ndivided into three groups according to their relation to silk and\r\ncotton:--\r\n\r\n1. Dye-stuffs possessing a great affinity to cotton and tinting the silk\r\nnot at all or only very little. To this class belong Chicago blues,\r\nBenzo blues, Diamine fast yellow A, Diamine orange G G, Diamine orange D\r\nC, Diamine blue B B, Diamine blue 3 B, Diamine sky blue F F, Diamine\r\nbrilliant blue G, Diamineral blue E, Diamine black B, Mikado browns,\r\nMikado oranges, Mikado yellows.\r\n\r\n2. Dye-stuffs producing on cotton and silk the same or nearly the same\r\nshade but covering the cotton better than the silk. These are\r\nThioflavine S, Diamine yellow N, Diamine gold, Diamine fast yellow B,\r\nDiamine orange B, Diamine grey G, Diamine rose B D, Diamine scarlet S,\r\nDiamine scarlet B, Diamine scarlet 3 B, Diamine red 5 B, Diamine fast\r\nred F, Diamine Bordeaux B, Diamine Bordeaux S, Diamine violet N,\r\nOxydiamine violet B, Diamine blue R W, Diamine black H W, Diamine steel\r\nblue L, Diamine dark blue B, Union black S, Oxydiamine black D,\r\nDiaminogene extra, Diaminogene B, Diamine brown M, Diamine brown 3 G,\r\nDiamine green B, Diamine green G.\r\n\r\n3. Dye-stuffs producing on cotton more or less different shades than on\r\nsilk. This group comprises Diamine blue C B, Diamine blue B G, Diamine\r\nblue B X, Diamine azo blue 2 R, Diamine blue 3 R, Diamine blue black E,\r\nDiamine black R O, Oxydiamine black S O O O, Diamine brown V, Diamine\r\nbrown B, Diamine bronze G. Cotton brown N produces on silk darker shades\r\nthan on cotton.\r\n\r\nOf course this classification cannot be taken as absolutely correct, as\r\nby raising or lowering the temperature during the dyeing process or by a\r\nlarger or smaller addition of soap or Glauber's salt (common salt,\r\nphosphate of soda), the dye-stuffs are more or less influenced in one or\r\nthe other direction. Diamine violet N, for instance, when dyed with an\r\nincreased addition of soap would dye the cotton somewhat lighter, but at\r\nthe same time leave the silk perfectly white.\r\n\r\n=Topping with Basic and Acid Dye-stuffs.=--As in very few cases only the\r\ndesired shade can be obtained in the first instance by bottoming with\r\ndirect colours, topping generally has to be resorted to. This is best\r\ndone with basic dyes, in some cases also with acid dye-stuffs in cold or\r\ntepid bath with addition of sulphuric acid, hydrochloric or acetic acid.\r\nThe use of acid dye-stuffs is restricted to cases where the silk alone\r\nis to be shaded. In most cases basic dye-stuffs are made use of, which\r\ndye silk and cotton the same shade and deepen the shade of the cotton if\r\nthe latter has a sufficiently good bottom, thus giving the goods a\r\nbetter and fuller appearance.\r\n\r\nIt is not advisable to employ basic and acid dye-stuffs in the same bath\r\nexcept when the quantities of either class are very small. Should it be\r\nnecessary to dye with large quantities of both classes, the acid\r\ndye-stuffs are first dyed in a tepid acid bath and then the goods are\r\ntopped with the basic dye-stuffs in a fresh cold bath with the addition\r\nof a little hydrochloric or acetic acid.\r\n\r\nOf the basic dye-stuffs which are available, the following are the most\r\nsuitable for topping: New methylene blue N, and other brands; New blue D\r\nand other brands; Cresyl blue, Methylindone B and R, Metaphenylene blue,\r\nIndazine; the various brands of Brilliant green, Solid green and\r\nMalachite green, Capri green, Cresyl violet, Thioflavine T, New\r\nphosphine G, Tannin orange R, and the various brands of Bismarck brown;\r\nSafranine, Magenta all brands, Tannin heliotrope, all brands of Neutral\r\nviolet, Methyl violet.\r\n\r\nOf the acid dye-stuffs, the following are good for topping or shading\r\nthe silk: Cyanole extra, Indigo blue N, Indigo blue S G N, and the\r\nvarious brands of Water blue, Soluble blue, Solid blue, and Induline;\r\nthe various brands of Acid green and Fast acid green; Indian yellow G\r\nand R, Naphthol yellow S, Tropæoline O and O O, and the various brands\r\nof Milling yellow and Orange; Azo red A, Azo rubine A, Archil substitute\r\nN, Azo orseille B B, Brilliant orseille C, and the various brands of\r\nEosine, Erythrosine, Rose bengale, Rhodamine, Brilliant croceine and\r\nBrilliant scarlet; the various brands of Formyl violet and Acid violet;\r\nAniline grey B and Nigrosine, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n_Bright Yellow._--Use 2 lb. Thioflavine S.\r\n\r\n_Deep Orange Yellow._--This can be dyed by using 2 lb. Diamine yellow N.\r\n\r\n_Gold Yellow._--Dye with 2 lb. Diamine gold. Some care must be taken\r\nwith this, especially not to dye too hot or the silk will be dyed deeper\r\nthan the cotton.\r\n\r\n_Deep Orange._--Use 2 lb. Diamine orange B.\r\n\r\n_Bright Rose._--Use 2 lb. Diamine Rose B D. Do not work too high,\r\nespecially when dyeing light rose shades, as then the silk is apt to\r\ntake up too much colour.\r\n\r\n_Scarlet._--Use in the dye-bath 2 lb. Diamine scarlet H S. The heat of\r\nthe dye-bath should not be allowed to exceed 160° to 170° F., or there\r\nis a risk of the shades becoming somewhat duller.\r\n\r\n_Crimson._--Dye with 2 lb. Diamine fast red F.\r\n\r\n_Violet._--Use 2 lb. Oxydiamine violet B.\r\n\r\n_Bright Blue._--A fine shade is dyed with 2 lb. Diamine blue R W.\r\n\r\n_Dark Green._--Use 2 lb. Diamine black H W. This gives a fine shade of\r\nbluish green.\r\n\r\n_Gold Brown._--Dye with 2 lb. Diamine brown 3 G at a low heat, from 150°\r\nto 160° F., otherwise the silk takes up too much colour.\r\n\r\n_Dark Green._--Dye with 2 lb. Diamine green B.\r\n\r\n_Deep Rose._--Dye with 2 lb. Diamine red 10 B.\r\n\r\n_Brilliant Yellow._--Dye with 1-1/2 lb. Mikado golden yellow 8 G; then\r\nenter into a cold bath which contains 1-1/2 per cent. Auramine II.

New methylene blue N and 2 oz. Chrysoidine.\r\n\r\n=Dyeing of Plain Black.=--Diamine blacks find a very extensive\r\napplication for dyeing blacks on satin, either dyed direct in one bath,\r\nor dyed, diazotised and developed.\r\n\r\nUnion black S and Oxydiamine black D are particularly suitable for\r\ndirect blacks, and are used either alone or in a combination with\r\nDiamine jet black S S, which produces a better covering of the silk, or\r\nwith Oxydiamine black S O O O, which deepens the shade of the cotton.\r\nAccording to the shade required Diamine fast yellow A and B, Diamine\r\ngreen B or G, or Alkaline blue may be used for shading.\r\n\r\nDye for about one hour at about 175° to 195° F. in as concentrated a\r\nbath as possible, with about 7 to 8 lb. dye per 100 lb. of satin, 8 to\r\n16 oz. Glauber's salt and 5 to 8 oz. soap per 10 gallons dye liquor;\r\nkeep cool in the bath for some time and rinse.\r\n\r\nThe raising is either done in a tepid soap bath with the addition of\r\nsome new methylene blue, or in an acid bath to which Naphthol, blue\r\nblack, Acid green, etc., is added for shading the silk.\r\n\r\nDirect dyed blacks are especially suitable for cheap goods (ribbons,\r\nlight linings, etc.), for which special fastness to water is not\r\nrequired; also for tram and tussar silk plushes, which are afterwards\r\ntopped with logwood.\r\n\r\nIf greater fastness is required, and more especially if it is a case of\r\nreplacing aniline black, Diaminogene diazotised and developed is a good\r\ndye-stuff. It is extensively used for dyeing umbrella cloths and\r\nlinings. Against aniline black it has the great advantage of not\r\ntendering the fibre in the least, and not turning green during storage.\r\nDiaminogene B and Diaminogene extra are mostly used for this purpose,\r\nthe former for jet blacks, the latter for blue-black shades.\r\n\r\nProceed as follows: Enter the boiled off and acidulated goods in a\r\nboiling bath as concentrated as possible, charged with 16 oz. Glauber's\r\nsalt per 10 gallons liquor, and 1 lb. acetic acid per 100 lb. dry goods.\r\nFor jet black add for 100 lb. satin, 6 to 8 lb. Diaminogene, 1 to 2 lb.\r\nNaphthylamine black D, 1/2 to 1 lb. Diamine fast yellow A or Diamine\r\ngreen B; for very deep shades about 1/5 of the quantity of Diaminogene B\r\nmay be replaced with Diamine jet black S S. For blue black, 6 to 8 lb.\r\nDiaminogene B, or 3 to 4 lb. Diaminogene B, and 3 to 4 lb. Diaminogene\r\nextra. Dye for three-quarters to one hour at the boil, allow to cool in\r\nthe bath for about thirty minutes, then rinse, diazotise and develop.\r\n\r\nPhenylene diamine (93 per cent.) serves for developing jet blacks mixed\r\nwith resorcine for greenish shades. Beta-naphthol is used for blue\r\nblacks (1 lb. 5 oz. per 100 lb. of dry material, dissolved in its own\r\nweight of soda lye, 75° Tw.). The three developers may also be mixed\r\nwith each other in any proportions.\r\n\r\nAfter developing soap hot with addition of new methylene blue, by\r\nchoosing a reddish or a bluish brand of new methylene, blue and black\r\nmay be shaded at will in the soap bath; finally rinse and raise with\r\nacetic acid.\r\n\r\nIf properly carried out this process will give a black almost equal to\r\naniline black; but having, as already mentioned, the advantage of not\r\nimpairing the strength of the fibre, and not turning green during\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\nAs the dye-baths for blacks are charged with a proportionately high\r\npercentage of dye-stuff for the first bath, and will not exhaust\r\ncompletely, it is advisable to preserve them for further use.\r\n\r\nFor subsequent lots only two-thirds to three-fourths of the quantities\r\nof dye-stuffs used for the first baths are required, which fact has to\r\nbe taken into consideration when calculating the cost of dyeing.\r\n\r\n=Dyeing Shot Effects on Satin.=--Not all direct colours are equally well\r\nadapted for the production of shot effects; those enumerated in Group\r\nI. are most suitable for the purpose, and should be dyed with a larger\r\nquantity of soap than is usual for solid shades, in order to leave the\r\nsilk as little tinted as possible. Dye-stuffs of the other groups may be\r\nused if the dyeing is conducted with proper care, _i.e._, keeping the\r\nbaths more alkaline and lowering the temperature. The goods are dyed\r\nwith the addition for the two coloured effects previously mentioned,\r\nthen they are well rinsed, and afterwards the silk is dyed with the\r\nsuitable acid dye-stuffs, with addition of sulphuric acid at a\r\ntemperature of about 150° F. Care should be taken not to use too much\r\nacid, and to keep the temperature of the bath sufficiently low, as\r\notherwise the acid may cause some of the dye-stuff to go off the cotton\r\nand tint the silk. It is best to work at a temperature of about 150° F.,\r\nwith addition of about 3 oz. concentrated sulphuric acid per 10 gallons\r\ndye-liquor.\r\n\r\nFor shading the silk all acid dye-stuffs can be used which have been\r\nmentioned in the foregoing tables.\r\n\r\nIf in shot effects the cotton is to be dyed bright and full shades, this\r\nis best achieved by dyeing with direct colours first, and then topping\r\nwith basic colours as follows:--\r\n\r\nBottom the cotton first with the suitable direct colours, then dye the\r\nsilk and then treat the pieces for about two hours in a cold tannin bath\r\n(about 8 oz. tannin per 10 gallons of water), then rinse once and pass\r\nthrough a tartar emetic bath (about 3 oz. per 10 gallons), rinse\r\nthoroughly and dye the cotton to shade with basic colours in a cold bath\r\nto which some acetic acid has been added.\r\n\r\nShould the silk become a little dull after this process, this may be\r\nremedied by a slight soaping. After dyeing rinse well and raise with\r\nacetic acid.\r\n\r\n=Shot Effects with Black Cotton Warp.=--Effects much in favour are\r\ndesigns composed of black cotton and light or coloured silk. The most\r\nsuitable black dye for this purpose is Diamine black B H, diazotised and\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nDye in as concentrated a bath as possible at about 160° F. with about 6\r\nlb. Diamine black B H, 1 lb. Diamine sky blue, pat., per 100 lb. of dry\r\ngoods, 1/2 lb. Diamine orange D C, pat., with an addition of 6-1/2 oz.\r\nsoap, 4 to 5 dr. soda per 10 gallons liquor, 16 oz. Glauber's salt.\r\nAfter dyeing rinse well in a bath containing 6 dr. soda and 3 oz. soap\r\nper 10 gallons water, diazotised in a fresh bath with 4 lb. nitrite of\r\nsoda and 12 lb. hydrochloric acid (per 100 lb. of dry goods), rinse\r\nthoroughly and develop with 3 to 16 oz. phenylene diamine (93 per\r\ncent.), with addition of 1 to 2 lb. soda. These two operations should\r\nfollow each other as quickly as possible, also care has to be taken that\r\nthe diazotised goods are not exposed to direct sunlight or heat, which\r\ncauses unlevel dyeings. The silk is then cleaned as far as possible by\r\nhot soaping, and dyed at about 120° to 140° F., with acid dye-stuffs and\r\nthe addition of sulphuric acid. After dyeing rinse as usual and\r\nbrighten.\r\n\r\n_Yellow and Violet,_--Dye the cotton with 2 lb. Diamine fast yellow A,\r\nthe silk with 1 lb. Cyanole extra, and 1 lb. Forinyl violet S 4 B.\r\n\r\n_Black and Blue._--Dye the cotton with 5 lb. Diamine black B H, 1 lb.\r\nDiamine sky blue, and 1/4 lb. Diamine orange D C. After dyeing,\r\ndiazotise and develop with phenylene diamine as described above. Then\r\ndye the silk with 1/2 lb. Pure soluble blue and 1 lb. Cyanole extra.\r\n\r\n_Black and Crimson._--Dye the black as in the previous recipe, then dye\r\nthe silk with 2 lb. Brilliant croceine 3 B and 1/2 lb.

Pure blue.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible to produce two coloured effects containing blue in\r\none bath by using Alkali blue as a constituent with a direct dye which\r\nworks only on to the cotton, the alkali blue going on to the silk, as,\r\nfor example, in the following recipes:--\r\n\r\n_Orange and Blue._--The dye-bath is made with 3 lb. Mikado orange 5 R O\r\nand 1-1/4 lb. Alkali blue 6 B. After the dyeing the goods are rinsed,\r\nthen passed through a bath of 1-1/2 lb. sulphuric acid in 10 gallons\r\nwater, washed well and dried.\r\n\r\n_Olive and Blue._--The dye-bath is made with 1-1/2 lb.

There are some operations through which cloths pass that have\r\nas their object the imparting of a certain appearance and texture to\r\nthem, generally known as finishing processes; of these it is not\r\nintended here to speak, but only of those which precede these, but\r\nfollow on the dyeing operations.\r\n\r\nThese processes are usually of a very simple character, and common to\r\nmost colours which are dyed, and here will be noticed the appliances and\r\nmanipulation necessary in the carrying out of these operations.\r\n\r\n=Squeezing or Wringing.=--It is advisable when the goods are taken out\r\nof the dye-bath to squeeze or wring them according to circumstances, in\r\norder to press out all surplus dye-liquor, which can be returned to the\r\ndye-bath if needful to be used again. This is an economical proceeding\r\nin many cases, especially in working with many of the old tannin\r\nmaterials like sumac, divi-divi, myrobolams, and the modern direct dyes\r\nwhich in the dyeing operations are not completely extracted out of the\r\nbath, or in other words, the dye-bath is not exhausted of colouring\r\nmatter, and, therefore, it can be used again for another lot of goods,\r\nsimply by adding fresh material to make up for that absorbed by the\r\nfirst lot of goods.\r\n\r\nLoose wool and loose cotton are somewhat difficult to deal with by\r\nsqueezing or wringing, but the material may be passed through a pair of\r\nsqueezing rollers, such as are shown in Fig. 31, which will be more\r\nfully dealt with later on. The machine shown is made by Messrs Read\r\nHolliday & Sons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Squeezing Rollers.]\r\n\r\n_Yarns in Hanks._--In the hank-dyeing process the hanks are wrung by\r\nplacing one end of the hank on a wringing horse placed over the\r\ndye-tub, a dye stick on the other end of the hank giving two or three\r\nsharp pulls to straighten out the yarn, and then twisting the stick\r\nround, the twisting of the yarns puts some pressure on the fibres,\r\nthoroughly and uniformly squeezing out the surplus liquor from the yarn.\r\n\r\n_Hank-wringing Machines._--Several forms of hank-wringing machines have\r\nbeen devised. One machine consists of a pair of discs fitted on an axle;\r\nthese discs carry strong hooks on which the hanks are placed. The\r\noperator places a hank on a pair of the hooks. The discs revolve and\r\ncarry round the hank, during the revolution the hank is twisted and the\r\nsurplus liquor wrung out, when the revolution of the discs carries the\r\nhank to the spot where it entered the machine the hooks fly back to\r\ntheir original position, the hank unwinds, it is then removed and a new\r\nhank put in its place, and so the machine works on, hanks being put on\r\nand off as required. The capacity of such a machine is great, and the\r\nefficiency of its working good.\r\n\r\nMr. S. Spencer of Whitefield makes a hank-wringing machine which\r\nconsists of a pair of hooks placed over a vat. One of the hooks is\r\nfixed, the other is made to rotate. A hank hung between the hooks is\r\nnaturally twisted, and all the surplus liquor wrung out. The liquor\r\nfalling into the vat.\r\n\r\n_Roller Squeezing Machines for Yarn._--Hanks may be passed through a\r\npair of indiarubber squeezing rollers, which may be so arranged that\r\nthey can be fixed as required on the dye-bath. Such a pair of rollers is\r\na familiar article, and quite common and in general use in dye houses.\r\n\r\n_Piece Goods._--These are generally passed open through a pair of\r\nsqueezing rollers which are often attached to the dye-vat in which the\r\npieces are dyed.\r\n\r\n_Read Holliday's Squeezing Machine._--In Fig. 31 is shown a squeezing\r\nmachine very largely employed for squeezing all kinds of piece goods\r\nand cotton warps after dyeing or washing. It consists of a pair of heavy\r\nrollers on which, by means of the screws shown at the top, a very\r\nconsiderable pressure can be brought to bear. The piece is run through\r\nthe eye shown on the left, by which it is made into a rope form, then\r\nover the guiding rollers and between the squeezing rollers, and into\r\nwaggons for conveyance to other machines. This machine is effective.\r\n\r\nAnother plan on which roller, or rather in this case disc, squeezing\r\nmachines is made, is to make the bottom roller with a square groove in\r\nthe centre, into this fits a disc, the cloth passing between them. The\r\ntop disc can by suitable screws be made to press upon the cloth in the\r\ngroove, and thus squeeze the water out of it.\r\n\r\n=Washing.=--One of the most important operations following that of\r\ndyeing is the washing with water to free the goods, whether cotton or\r\nwoollen, from all traces of loose dye, acids, mordanting materials,\r\netc., which it is not desirable should be left in, as they might\r\ninterfere with the subsequent finishing operations. For this purpose a\r\nplentiful supply of good clean water is required; this should be as soft\r\nas possible, free from any suspended matter which might settle upon the\r\ndyed goods, and stain or speck them.\r\n\r\nWashing may be done by hand, as it frequently was in olden days, by\r\nsimply immersing the dyed fabrics in a tub of water, shaking, then\r\nwringing out, again placing in fresh water to finish off. Or if the\r\ndye-works were on the banks of a running stream of clean water the dyed\r\ngoods were simply hung in the stream to be washed in a very effectual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn these days it is best to resort to washing machines adapted to deal\r\nwith the various kinds of fibrous materials and fabrics in which they\r\ncan be subjected to a current of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Yarn-washing Machine.]\r\n\r\n_Loose Wool and Cotton._--If this has been dyed by hand then the washing\r\nmay also be done in the same way by hand in a plain vat. If the dyeing\r\nhas been done on a machine, then the washing can be done on the same\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n_Yarns._--Yarn in the cop form is best washed in the machine in which it\r\nis dyed.\r\n\r\n_Yarns in Hanks._--A very common form of washing machine is shown in\r\nFig. 32. As will be seen it consists of a wooden vat, over which are\r\narranged a series of revolving reels on which the hanks are hung. The\r\nhanks are kept in motion through the water, and so every part of the\r\nyarn is thoroughly washed. Guides keep the hanks of yarn separate and\r\nprevent any entanglement one with another. A pipe delivers constantly a\r\ncurrent of clean water, while another pipe carries away the used water.\r\nMotion is given to the reels in this case by a donkey engine attached to\r\nthe machine, but it may also be driven by a belt from the main driving\r\nshaft of the works. This machine is very effective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Dye-house Washing Machine.]\r\n\r\n_Piece Goods._--Piece goods are mostly washed in machines, of which two\r\nbroad types may be recognised; first, those where the pieces are dealt\r\nwith in the form of ropes in a twisted form, and, second, those where\r\nthe pieces are washed open. There are some machines in which the cloths\r\nmay be treated either in the open or rope form as may be thought most\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Cloth-washing Machine.]\r\n\r\nFig. 33 represents a fairly well-known machine, made by Messrs. Mather &\r\nPlatt, in which the pieces are treated in a rope-like form. It consists\r\nof a trough in which a constant current of water is maintained. At one\r\nend of this trough is a square beating roller, at the other a wooden\r\nlattice roller. Above the square beater, and out of the trough, are a\r\npair of rollers whose purpose is to draw the cloth through the machine\r\nand also partly to act as squeezing rollers. As will be seen the cloth\r\nis threaded in rope form spirally round the rollers, passing in at one\r\nend and out at the other, pegs in a guide rail serving to keep the\r\nvarious portions separate. The square beater in its revolutions has a\r\nbeating action on the cloth tending to more effectual washing. The\r\nlattice roller is simply a guide roller.\r\n\r\nFig. 34 shows a washing machine very largely used in the wool-dyeing\r\ntrade. The principal portion of this machine is of wood.\r\n\r\nThe internal parts consist of a large wooden bowl, or oftener, as in the\r\nmachine under notice, of a pair of wooden bowls which are pressed\r\ntogether by springs with some small degree of force. Between these bowls\r\nthe cloth is placed, more or less loosely twisted up in a rope form, and\r\nthe machines are made to take four, six or eight pieces, or lengths of\r\npieces, at one time, the ends of the pieces being stitched together. A\r\npipe running along the front of the machine conveys a constant current\r\nof clean water which is caused to impinge in the form of jets on the\r\npieces of cloth as they run through the machine, while an overflow\r\ncarries away the used water. The goods are run in this machine until\r\nthey are considered to be sufficiently washed, which may take half to\r\none and a half hours.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 35 is shown a machine designed to wash pieces in the broad or\r\nopen state. The machine contains a large number of guide rollers, built\r\nmore or less open, round which the pieces are guided--the ends of the\r\npieces being stitched together. Pipes carrying water are so arranged\r\nthat jets of clean water impinge on and thoroughly wash the cloth as it\r\npasses through--the construction of the guide rollers facilitating the\r\nefficient washing of the goods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Cloth-washing Machine.]\r\n\r\n=Soaping.=--- Sometimes yarns or cloths have to be passed through a soap\r\nbath after being dyed in order to brighten up the colours or develop\r\nthem in some way. In the case of yarns this can be done on the reel\r\nwashing machine such as is shown in Fig. 32. In the case of piece goods,\r\na continuous machine, in which the washing, soaping, etc., can be\r\ncarried on simultaneously, is often employed. Such a machine is shown in\r\nFig. 36. It consists of a number of compartments fitted with guide\r\nrollers so that the cloth passes up and down several times through the\r\nliquors in the compartments. Between one compartment and another is\r\nplaced a pair of squeezing rollers. The cloth is threaded in a\r\ncontinuous manner, well shown in the drawing, through the machine. In\r\none compartment it is treated with water, in another soap liquor, in\r\nanother water, and so on; and these machines may be made with two, three\r\nor more compartments as may be necessary for the particular work in\r\nhand. As seen in the drawing, the cloth passes in at one end and out at\r\nthe other finished. It is usually arranged that a continuous current of\r\nthe various liquors used flows through the various compartments, thus\r\nensuring the most perfect treatment of the cloths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Washing and Soaping Vats.]\r\n\r\n=Steaming.=--Sometimes it becomes necessary to subject dyed goods to a\r\nprocess of steaming, as, for instance, with steam aniline blacks, khaki\r\nshades, alizarine reds, etc., for the purpose of more fully developing\r\nand fixing the dye upon the fibre. In the case of yarns, this operation\r\nis carried out in the steaming cottage, one form of which is shown in\r\nFig. 37. It consists of a horizontal cylindrical iron vessel like a\r\nsteam boiler, one end is entirely closed, while the other is made to\r\nopen and be closed tightly and hermetically. The cottage is fitted with\r\nthe necessary steam inlet and outlet pipes, drain pipes for condensed\r\nwater, pressure gauges. The yarn to be steamed is hung on rods placed on\r\na skeleton frame waggon on wheels which can be run in and out of the\r\nsteaming cottage as is required. The drawing shows well the various\r\nimportant parts of the machine. In the case of piece goods these also\r\ncan be hung from rods in folds on such a waggon, but it is much more\r\ncustomary to employ a continuous steaming chamber, very similar to the\r\nageing and oxidising machine shown in Fig. 38, and also used in the\r\ndyeing of aniline black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Steaming Cottage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Steaming and Ageing Chamber.]\r\n\r\n=Drying.=--Following on the washing comes the final operation of the\r\ndyeing process, that of drying the dyed and washed goods. Textile\r\nfabrics of all kinds after they have passed through dye-baths, washing\r\nmachines, etc., contain a large amount of water, often exceeding in\r\nweight that of the fibre itself, and to take the goods direct from the\r\npreceding operations to the drying plant means that a considerable\r\namount of fuel must be expended to drive off this large amount of water.\r\nIt is therefore very desirable that the goods be freed from as much of\r\nthis water as possible before they are sent into any drying chambers,\r\nand this may be done in three ways, by wringing, squeezing and\r\nhydro-extracting. The first two methods have already been described (p.\r\n239, etc.) and need not again be alluded to; the last needs some\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Hydro-extractor.]\r\n\r\nHydro-extractors are a most efficient means for extracting water out of\r\ntextile fabrics. They are made in a variety of forms by several makers.\r\nEssentially they consist of a cylindrical vessel, or basket, as it is\r\ncalled, with perforated sides so constructed that it can be revolved at\r\na high speed. This vessel is enclosed in an outer cage. The goods are\r\nplaced in the basket, as it is termed, and then this is caused to\r\nrevolve at high speed, when centrifugal action comes into play, and the\r\nwater contained in the goods finds its way to the outside of the basket\r\nthrough the perforations, and so away from the goods. Hydro-extractors\r\nare made in a variety of sizes and forms--in some the driving gear is\r\nabove, in others below the basket; in some the driving is done by\r\nbelt-gearing, in others a steam engine is directly connected with the\r\nbasket. Figs. 39 and 40 show two forms which are much in use in the\r\ntextile industry. They are very efficient, and extract water from\r\ntextile goods more completely than any other means, as will be obvious\r\nfrom a study of the table below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Hydro-extractor.]\r\n\r\nThe relative efficiency of the three systems of extracting the moisture\r\nout of textile fabrics has been investigated by Grothe, who gives in his\r\n_Appretur der Gewebe_, published in 1882, the following table showing\r\nthe percentage amount of water removed in fifteen minutes:--\r\n\r\nYarns.          Wool.         Silk.        Cotton.      Linen.\r\n\r\nWringing           44.5          45.4          45.3         50.3\r\nSqueezing          60.0          71.4          60.0         73.6\r\nHydro-extracting   83.5          77.0          81.2         82.8\r\n\r\nPieces.\r\n\r\nWringing           33.4          44.5          44.5         54.6\r\nSqueezing          64.0          69.7          72.2         83.0\r\nHydro-extracting   77.8          75.5          82.3         86.0\r\n\r\nIn the practical working of hydro-extractors it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that the goods be carefully and regularly laid in the\r\nbasket--not too much in one part and too little in another. Any\r\nunevenness in this respect at the speed at which they are driven lays\r\nsuch a strain on the bearings as to seriously endanger the safety of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nAfter being wrung, squeezed or hydro-extracted the goods are ready to be\r\ndried. In the case of yarns, this may be done in rooms heated by steam\r\npipes placed on the floor, the hanks being hung on rods suspended from\r\nracks arranged for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Automatic Yarn-dryer.]\r\n\r\nWhere large quantities of yarn have to be dried, it is most economical\r\nto employ a yarn-drying machine, and one form of such is shown in Fig.\r\n41. The appearance of the machine is that of one long room from the\r\noutside; internally it is divided into compartments, each of which is\r\nheated up by suitably arranged steam pipes, but the degree of heating in\r\neach compartment varies--at the entrance end it is high, at the exit end\r\nlower. The yarn is fed in at one end, being hung on rods, and by\r\nsuitable gearing it is carried directly through the various chambers or\r\nsections, and in its passage the heat to which it is subjected drives\r\noff the water it contains. The yarn requires no attention from the time\r\nit passes in wet at the one end of the machine and comes out dry at the\r\nother end. The amount of labour required is slight, only that\r\nrepresented by filling the sticks with wet yarn and emptying them of the\r\ndried yarn. The machine works regularly and well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Truck Yarn-dryer.]\r\n\r\nThe drying is accomplished by circulating heated air through the yarns,\r\nthis heating being effected by steam coils, fresh air continually enters\r\nthe chambers, while water-saturated air is as continually being taken\r\nout at the top of the chamber. One of the great secrets in all drying\r\noperations is to have a constant current of fresh hot air playing on the\r\ngoods to be dried; this absorbs the moisture they contain, and the\r\nwater-charged air thus produced must be taken away as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 43.--Drying Cylinders.]\r\n\r\nFig. 42 shows what is called a truck yarn-dryer, which consists of a\r\nchamber heated with steam pipes and fitted with an exhausting fan to\r\ndraw out the air and water vapour which is produced. The yarns are hung\r\non trucks which can be run in and out of the chamber for filling and\r\nemptying.\r\n\r\n_Piece Goods._--The most convenient manner of drying piece goods is to\r\nemploy the steam cylinder drying machine, such as is shown in Fig. 43.\r\nThis consists of a number of hollow tin or copper cylinders which can be\r\nheated by steam passing in through the axles of the cylinders, which are\r\nmade hollow on purpose. The cloth to be dried passes round these\r\ncylinders, which revolve while the cloth passes. They work very\r\neffectually. The cylinders are arranged sometimes, as in the drawing,\r\nvertically; at other times horizontally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTESTING OF THE COLOUR OF DYED FABRICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is frequently desirable that dyers should be able to ascertain with\r\nsome degree of accuracy what dyes have been used to dye any particular\r\nsamples of dyed cloth that has been offered to them to match. In these\r\ndays of the thousand and one different dyes that are known it is by no\r\nmeans an easy thing to do; and when, as is most often the case, two or\r\nthree dye-stuffs have been used in the production of a shade, the\r\ndifficulty is materially increased.\r\n\r\nThe only available method is to try the effect of various acid and\r\nalkaline reagents on the sample, noting whether any change of colour\r\noccurs, and judging accordingly. It would be a good thing for dyers to\r\naccustom themselves to test the dyeings they do, and so accumulate a\r\nfund of practical experience which will stand them in good stead\r\nwhenever they have occasion to examine a dyed pattern of unknown origin.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this book does not permit of there being given a series of\r\nelaborate tables showing the action of various chemical reagents on\r\nfabrics dyed with various colours; and such, indeed, serve very little\r\npurpose, for it is most difficult to describe the minor differences\r\nwhich often serve to distinguish one colour from another. Instead of\r\ndoing so, we will point out in some detail the methods of carrying out\r\nthe various tests, and advise all dyers to carry these out for\r\nthemselves on samples dyed with known colours, and when they have an\r\nunknown colour to test to make tests comparatively with known colours\r\nthat they think are likely to have been used in the production of the\r\ndyed fabric they are testing.\r\n\r\nOne very common method is to spot the fabric, that is, to put a drop of\r\nthe reagent on it, usually with the end of the stopper of the reagent\r\nbottle, and to observe the colour changes, if any, which ensue. This is\r\na very useful test and should not be omitted, and it is often employed\r\nin the testing of indigo dyed goods with nitric acid, those of logwood\r\nwith hydrochloric acid, alizarine with caustic soda, and many others. It\r\nis simple and easy to carry out, and only takes a few minutes.\r\n\r\nTo make a complete series of tests of dyed fabrics there should be\r\nprovided the following reagents:--\r\n\r\n1. Strong sulphuric acid, as bought.\r\n2. Dilute sulphuric acid, being the strong acid diluted with twenty\r\n   times its volume of water.\r\n3. Concentrated hydrochloric acid.\r\n4. Dilute hydrochloric acid, 1 acid to 20 water.\r\n5. Concentrated nitric acid.\r\n6. Dilute nitric acid, 1 acid to 20 water.\r\n7. Acetic acid.\r\n8. Caustic soda solution, 5 grams in 100 c.c. water.\r\n9. Ammonia (strong).\r\n10. Dilute ammonia, 1 strong ammonia to 10 water.\r\n11. Carbonate of soda solution, 6 grams in 100 c.c. water.\r\n12. Bleaching powder solution, 2° Tw.\r\n13. Bisulphite of soda, 72° Tw.\r\n14. Stannous chloride, 10 grams crystals in 100 c.c. water, with a\r\n    little hydrochloric acid.\r\n15. Methylated spirit.\r\n\r\nSmall swatches of the dyed goods are put in clean porcelain basins, and\r\nsome of these solutions poured over them. Any change of colour of the\r\ncloth is noted, as well as whether any colour is imparted to the\r\nsolutions. After making observations of the effects in the cold the\r\nliquids may be warmed and the results again noted. After being treated\r\nwith the acids the swatches should be well washed with water, when the\r\noriginal colour may be wholly or partially restored.\r\n\r\nTo give tables showing the effects of these reagents on the numerous\r\ndyes now known would take up too much room and not serve a very useful\r\npurpose, as such tables, if too much relied on, leave the operator\r\nsomewhat uncertain as to what he has before him. The reader will find in\r\nHurst's _Dictionary of Coal-tar Colours_ some useful notes as to the\r\naction of acids and alkalies on the various colours that may be of\r\nservice to him.\r\n\r\nAlizarine and the series of dye-stuffs to which it has given its name,\r\nfustic, cochineal, logwood and other dyes of a similar class require the\r\nfabric to be mordanted, and the presence of such mordant is occasionally\r\nan indirect proof of the presence of these dyes.\r\n\r\nTo detect these mordants, a piece of the swatch should be burnt in a\r\nporcelain or platinum crucible over a Bunsen burner, care being taken\r\nthat all carbonaceous matter be burnt off. A white ash will indicate the\r\npresence of alumina mordants, red ash that of iron mordants, and a\r\ngreenish ash chrome mordants.\r\n\r\nTo confirm these the following chemical tests may be applied: Boil the\r\nash left in the crucible with a little strong hydrochloric acid and\r\ndilute with water. Pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through\r\nthe solution; if there be any tin present a brown precipitate of tin\r\nsulphide will be obtained. This can be filtered off. The filtrate is\r\nboiled for a short time with nitric acid, and ammonia is added to the\r\nsolution when alumina is thrown down as a white gelatinous precipitate;\r\niron is thrown down as a brown red bulky precipitate; while chrome is\r\nthrown down as a greyish-looking gelatinous precipitate. The precipitate\r\nobtained with the ammonia is filtered off, and a drop of ammonium\r\nsulphide added, when any zinc present will be thrown down as white\r\nprecipitate of zinc sulphide: to the filtrate from this ammonium oxalate\r\nmay be added, when if lime is present a white precipitate of calcium\r\noxalate is obtained.\r\n\r\nA test for iron is to dissolve some of the ash in a little hydrochloric\r\nacid, and add a few drops of potassium ferrocyanide solution, when if\r\nany iron be present a blue precipitate will be obtained.\r\n\r\nTo make more certain of the presence of chrome, heat a little of the ash\r\nof the cloth with caustic soda and chlorate of soda in a porcelain\r\ncrucible until well fused, then dissolve in water, acidify with acetic\r\nacid and add lead acetate; a yellow precipitate indicates the presence\r\nof chrome.\r\n\r\nA book on qualitative chemical analysis should be referred to for\r\nfurther details and tests for metallic mordants.\r\n\r\nThe fastness of colours to light, air, rubbing, washing, soaping, acids\r\nand alkalies is a feature of some considerable importance. There are\r\nindeed few colours that will resist all these influences, and such are\r\nfully entitled to be called fast. The decree of fastness varies very\r\nconsiderably. Some colours will resist acids and alkalies well, but are\r\nnot fast to light and air; some will resist washing and soaping, but are\r\nnot fast to acids; Some may be fast to light, but are not so to washing.\r\nThe following notes will show how to test these features:--\r\n\r\n=Fastness to Light and Air.=--This is simply tested by hanging a piece\r\nof the dyed cloth in the air, keeping a piece in a drawer to refer to,\r\nso that the influence on the original colour can be noted from time to\r\ntime. If the piece is left out in the open one gets not only the effect\r\nof light but also that of climate on the colour, and there is no doubt\r\nwind, rain, hail and snow have some influence on the fading of the\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nIf the piece is exposed under glass, the climatic influences do not come\r\ninto play, and one gets the effect of light alone.\r\n\r\nIn making tests of fastness, the dyer will and does pay due regard to\r\nthe character of the influences that the material will be subjected to\r\nin actual use, and these vary very considerably; thus the colour of\r\nunderclothing need not be fast to light, for it is rarely subjected to\r\nthat agent of destruction. On the other hand it must be fast to washing,\r\nfor that is an operation to which underclothing is subjected week by\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nWindow curtains are much exposed to light and air, and, therefore,\r\ncolours in which they are dyed should be fast to light and air. On the\r\nother hand these curtains are rarely washed, and so the colour need not\r\nbe quite fast to washing. And so with other kinds of fabrics, there are\r\nscarcely two kinds which are subjected to the same influences, and\r\nrequire the colours to have the same degree of fastness.\r\n\r\nThe fastness to rubbing is generally tested by rubbing the dyed cloth on\r\na piece of white paper.\r\n\r\n=Fastness to Washing.=--This is generally tested by boiling a swatch of\r\nthe cloth in a solution of soap containing 4 grams of a good neutral\r\ncurd soap per litre for ten minutes and noting the effect--whether the\r\nsoap solution becomes coloured and to what degree, or whether it remains\r\ncolourless, and also whether the colour of the swatch has changed at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOne very important point in connection with the soaping test is whether\r\na colour will run into a white fabric that may be soaped along with it.\r\nThis is tested by twisting strands of the dyed yarn or cloth with white\r\nyarn or cloth and boiling them in the soap liquor for ten minutes and\r\nthen noting the effect, particularly observing whether the white pieces\r\nhave taken up any colour.\r\n\r\nFastness to acids and fastness to alkalies is observed while carrying\r\nout the various acid and alkali tests given above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL DYEING AND COMPARATIVE DYE TESTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery dyer ought to be able to make experiments in the mordanting and\r\ndyeing of textile fibres for the purpose of ascertaining the best\r\nmethods of applying mordants or dye-stuffs, the best methods of\r\nobtaining any desired shade, and for the purpose of making comparative\r\ntests of dyes or mordanting materials with the object of determining\r\ntheir strength and value. This is not by any means difficult, nor does\r\nit involve the use of any expensive apparatus, so that a dyer need not\r\nhesitate to set up a small dyeing laboratory for fear of the expense\r\nwhich it might entail.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the work indicated above there will be required\r\nseveral pieces of apparatus. First, a small chemical balance, one that\r\nwill carry 100 grams in each pan is quite large enough; and such a one,\r\nquite accurate enough for this work, can be bought for 25s. to 30s.,\r\nwhile if the dyer be too poor even for this, a cheap pair of\r\napothecaries' scales might be used. It is advisable to procure a set of\r\ngram weights, and to get accustomed to them, which is not a very\r\ndifficult task.\r\n\r\nIn using the balance always put the substance to be weighed on the\r\nleft-hand pan, and the weights on the right-hand pan. Never put\r\nchemicals of any kind direct on the pan, but weigh them in a watch\r\nglass, small porcelain basin, or glass beaker, which has first been\r\nweighed, according to the nature of the material which is being\r\nweighed. The sets of weights are always fitted into a block or box, and\r\nevery time they are used they should be put back into their proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe experimenter will find it convenient to provide himself with a few\r\nsmall porcelain basins, glass beakers, cubic centimetre measures, two or\r\nthree 200 c.c. flasks with a mark on the neck, a few pipettes of various\r\nsizes, 10 c.c., 20 c.c., 25 c.c.\r\n\r\nThe most important feature is the dyeing apparatus. Where only a single\r\ndye test is to be made, a small copper or enamelled iron saucepan, such\r\nas can be bought at any ironmonger's, may be used; this may conveniently\r\nbe heated by a gas boiling burner, such as can also be bought at an\r\nironmonger's or plumber's for 2s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Experimental Dye-bath.]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, advisable to have means whereby several dyeing\r\nexperiments can be made at one time and under precisely the same\r\nconditions, and this cannot be done by using the simple means noted\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nTo be able to make perfectly comparative dyeing experiments it is best\r\nto use porcelain dye-pots--these may be bought from most dealers in\r\nchemical apparatus--and to heat them in a water-bath arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe simplest arrangement is sketched in Fig. 44; it consists of a copper\r\nbath measuring 15 inches long by 10-1/2 inches broad and 6-1/2 inches\r\ndeep--this is covered by a lid in which are six apertures to take the\r\nporcelain dye-baths. The bath is heated by two round gas boiling burners\r\nof the type already referred to.\r\n\r\nThe copper bath is filled with water, which, on being heated to the boil\r\nby the gas burners, heats up the dye liquids in the dye-pots. The\r\ntemperature in the dye-pots under such conditions can never reach the\r\nboiling point; where it is desirable, as in some cases of wool\r\nmordanting and dyeing, that it should boil, there should be added to the\r\nwater in the copper bath a quantity of calcium chloride, which forms a\r\nsolution that has a much higher boiling point than that of water, and so\r\nthe dye liquors in the dye-pots may be heated up to the boil.\r\n\r\nAn objection might be raised that with such an apparatus the temperature\r\nin every part of the bath may not be uniform, and so the temperature of\r\nthe dye-liquors in the pots may vary also, and differences of\r\ntemperature often have a considerable influence on the shade of the\r\ncolour which is being dyed. This is a minor objection, which is more\r\nacademic in its origin than of practical importance. To obviate this Mr.\r\nWilliam Marshall of the Rochdale Technical School has devised a circular\r\nform of dye-bath, in which the temperature in every part can be kept\r\nquite uniform.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing laboratories of technical schools and colleges are generally\r\nprovided with a more elaborate set of dyeing appliances. These, in the\r\nlatest constructed, consist of a copper bath supported on a hollow pair\r\nof trunnions, that the bath can be turned over if needed. Into the bath\r\nare firmly fixed three earthenware or porcelain dye-pots; steam for\r\nheating can be sent through the trunnions. After the dyeing tests have\r\nbeen made the apparatus can be turned over, and the contents of the\r\ndye-pots emptied into a sink which is provided for the purpose.\r\n\r\nMany other pieces of apparatus have been devised and made for the\r\npurpose of carrying on dyeing experiments on the small scale, but it\r\nwill not be needful to describe these in detail. After all no more\r\nefficient apparatus can be desired than that described above.\r\n\r\nDyeing experiments can be made with either yarns or pieces of\r\ncloth--swatches, as they are commonly called--a very convenient size is\r\na small skein of yarn or a piece of cloth having a weight of 5 grams.\r\nThese test skeins or pieces ought to be well washed in hot water before\r\nuse, so that they are clean and free from any size or grease. A little\r\nsoda or soap will facilitate the cleansing process.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out a dyeing test the dye-pot should be filled with the\r\nwater required, using as little as can be consistent with the dye swatch\r\nbeing handled comfortably therein, then there is added the required\r\nmordants, chemicals, dyes, etc., according to the character of the work\r\nwhich is being done.\r\n\r\nOf such chemicals as soda, caustic soda, sodium sulphate (Glauber's\r\nsalt), tartar, bichromate of potash, it will be found convenient to\r\nprepare stock solutions of known strength, say 50 grams per litre, and\r\nthen by means of a pipette any required quantity can be conveniently\r\nadded. The same plan might be followed in the case of dyes which are\r\nconstantly in use, in this case, 5 grams per litre will be found strong\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nSupposing it is desired to make a test of a sample of direct red, using\r\nthe following proportions: 2 per cent. dye-stuff, 3 per cent. soda, 15\r\nper cent. Glauber's salt, and the weight of the swatch which is being\r\nused is 5 grams. The following calculations are to be made to give the\r\nquantities of the ingredients required.\r\n\r\nFor the dye-stuff:--\r\n\r\n5 (weight of swatch) multiplied by 2 (per cent. of dye) and divided by\r\n100 equals--\r\n\r\n                        5 x 2\r\n                       ------- = 0.1 gram dye\r\n                         100\r\n\r\nFor the soda we have similarly:--\r\n\r\n                   5 x 3\r\n                  ------- = 0.15 gram soda.\r\n                    100\r\n\r\nFor the Glauber's salt:--\r\n\r\n                 5 x 15\r\n                -------- = 0.75 gram Glauber's salt.\r\n                  100\r\n\r\nThese quantities may be weighed out and added to the dye-bath, or if\r\nsolutions are kept, a calculation can be made as to the number of cubic\r\ncentimetres which contain the above quantities, and these measured out\r\nand added to the dye-bath.\r\n\r\nWhen all is ready, the bath is heated up, the swatch entered, and the\r\nwork of the test entered upon.\r\n\r\nStudents are recommended to make experiments on such points as:--\r\n\r\nThe shades obtained by using various proportions of dye-stuffs.\r\n\r\nThe influence of various assistants--common salt, soda, Glauber's salt,\r\nborax, phosphate of soda--in the bath.\r\n\r\nThe influence of varying proportions of mordants on the shade of dyeing.\r\n\r\nThe value of various assistants, tartar, oxalic acid, lactic acid,\r\nsulphuric acid, on the fixation of mordants.\r\n\r\nThe relative value of different tannin matters, etc.\r\n\r\nEach dyer should make himself a pattern-book into which he should enter\r\nhis tests, with full particulars as to how they have been produced at\r\nthe side.\r\n\r\nIt is important that a dyer should be able to make comparative dye\r\ntests to ascertain the relative strength of any two, or more samples of\r\ndyes which may be sent to him. This is not difficult, but requires\r\nconsiderable care in carrying out the various operations involved.\r\n\r\nOf each of the samples of dyes 0.5 gram should be weighed out and\r\ndissolved in 100 c.c. of water, care being taken that every portion of\r\nthe dye is dissolved before any of the solution is used in making up the\r\ndye-vats. Care should also be taken that the skeins of yarn or swatches\r\nof cloth are exactly equal in weight; that the same volume of water is\r\nplaced in each of the dye-pots; that the same amount of sulphate of soda\r\nor other dye assistants are added; that the quantities of dye-stuff and\r\nsolutions used are equal; in fact, that in all respects the conditions\r\nof dyeing are exactly the same, such, in fact, being the vital\r\nconditions in making comparative dye tests of the actual dyeing strength\r\nof several samples of dyes.\r\n\r\nAfter the swatches have been dyed they are rinsed and then dried, when\r\nthe depth of shade dyed on them may be compared one with another. To\r\nprevent any mistakes, it is well to mark the swatches with one, two,\r\nthree or more cuts as may be required.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to ascertain if two dyes are different in strength of\r\ncolour than to ascertain the relative difference between them. There are\r\ntwo plans available for this purpose--one is a dyeing test, the other is\r\na colorimetric test made with the solutions of the dyes.\r\n\r\n=Dyeing Test.=--This method of ascertaining the relative value of two\r\ndyes as regards strength of colour is carried out as follows: A\r\npreliminary test will show which is stronger than the other. Then there\r\nis prepared a series of dye-vats--one contains a swatch with the deepest\r\nof the two dyes, which is taken as the standard; the others, swatches\r\nwith the other dye, but containing 2, 5 and 10 per cent. more dye-stuff,\r\nand all these swatches are dyed together, and after drying a comparison\r\ncan be made between them and the standard swatch and a judgment formed\r\nas to the relative strength of the two dyes. A little experience will\r\nsoon enable the dyer to form a correct judgment of the difference in\r\nstrength between two samples of dye-stuff.\r\n\r\n=Colorimetric Test.=--This is based on the principle that the colour of\r\na solution of dye-stuff will be proportionate to its strength. Two white\r\nglass tubes equal in diameter are taken. Solutions of the dye-stuff, 0.5\r\ngram in 100 c.c. of water, are prepared, care being taken that the\r\nsolution is complete. Of one of these solutions 5 c.c. is taken and\r\nplaced in one of the glass tubes, and 5 c.c. of the other solution is\r\nplaced in the other glass tube. Of water 25 c.c. is now added to each\r\ntube, and then the colour of the diluted liquids is compared by looking\r\nthrough them in a good light. That sample which gives the deeper\r\nsolution is the stronger in colouring power. By diluting the stronger\r\nsolution with water until it is of the same depth of colour as the\r\nweaker, it may be assumed that the depth of the columns of liquid in the\r\ntwo tubes is in proportion to the relative strength of the two samples.\r\nThus, if in one tube there are 30 c. of liquid and in the other 25 c.,\r\nthen the relative strength is as 30 to 25; and if the first is taken as\r\nthe standard at 100, a proportion sum gives\r\n\r\n30    :    25    : :    100    :    83.3,\r\n\r\nthat is, the weaker sample has only 83.3 per cent, of the strength of\r\nthe stronger sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nCOMPILED BY MISS GRACE GREENWOOD, B.A. (LOND.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAcetate liquor, 190, 193.\r\n-- of alumina, 170.\r\n-- of chrome, 180.\r\n-- of lead,

The writer is evidently a\r\n    practical man, who also has taken the trouble to make himself\r\n    acquainted with the scientific and technical side of his trade ...\r\n    French methods differ largely from our own: sometimes we think our\r\n    ways the best, but not always. The practical man may pick up many\r\n    useful hints which may help him to improve his methods.\" --_Shoe\r\n    Manufacturers' Monthly Journal._\r\n\r\n    \"This book cannot fail to be of great value to all engaged in the\r\n    leather trades ... The British may believe that the French can teach\r\n    them nothing in the work of leather tanning generally, but a\r\n    comparison of the methods of the two countries will certainly yield\r\n    a few wrinkles which may lead to advantageous results. Only a man\r\n    understanding the science and technique of the trade could have\r\n    written the book, and it is well done.\" --_Midland Free Press._\r\n\r\n    \"Gives much useful and interesting information concerning the\r\n    various processes by which the skins of animals are converted into\r\n    leather. Written by a French Chemist after five years of constant\r\n    study and application: it shows all that detail of analysis which we\r\n    are accustomed to find in scientists, and which the practical tanner\r\n    is too much in the habit of ignoring, sometimes to his own loss.\"\r\n    --_Leeds Mercury._\r\n\r\n    \"Nor can there be much doubt that this expectation will be fully\r\n    justified by the result. Thanks to the conspicuous painstaking with\r\n    which Mr. Addyman has discharged his duty, and the 123 illustrations\r\n    by which the text is elucidated, the volume can hardly fail to prove\r\n    a very valuable standard work of its class. It can thus be\r\n    confidently recommended to all who are more or less practically\r\n    interested in the technology of a very important subject.\"--_Leicester\r\n    Post._\r\n\r\n    \"This is, in every respect, an altogether admirable, practical,\r\n    clear and lucid treatise on the various and numerous branches of the\r\n    great leather industry, of which it deals in an exhaustive, highly\r\n    intelligent, workmanlike and scientific manner ... It is a handsome\r\n    addition to every man's knowledge of his trade, whether he be a\r\n    leading director of a large public company, or an industrious\r\n    employee in the works, wishing to improve his services by the\r\n    addition of his brains to his work.\" --_Shoe and Leather Trader._\r\n\r\n    \"M. Villon writes as one having a very full knowledge of all\r\n    branches of the subject, and in days when foreign competition has\r\n    enforced on English manufacturers the importance of no longer being\r\n    content with rule-of-thumb methods which have come down to them from\r\n    their forefathers it certainly should be worth the while of English\r\n    tanners to see what lessons they can learn from French practice, and\r\n    French practice, we should imagine, could hardly have a better\r\n    exponent than the author of this large volume.\" --_Western Daily\r\n    Press and Bristol Times._\r\n\r\n    \"At a time when all or nearly all our British industries are to a\r\n    greater or less extent hampered by the pressure of continental and\r\n    American competition, any hints that can be obtained as to the\r\n    methods pursued by competitors must necessarily be of value ... That\r\n    it will be of interest and value, not merely to English tanners, but\r\n    to those associated with many kindred industrial branches, goes\r\n    without saying ... As a work of reference the volume will be\r\n    extremely useful in the trade, and where leisure affords sufficient\r\n    opportunity a careful perusal and study of it would afford ample\r\n    reward.\" --_Kettering Guardian._\r\n\r\n    \"This is a very handsomely got up and elaborate work just issued by\r\n    this well-known technical book-publishing firm ... When we say that\r\n    the work consists of over 500 large pages with about 120\r\n    illustrations, and almost innumerable tables, it will be seen at\r\n    once that we cannot attempt anything like an exhaustive _resume_ of\r\n    its contents, and even if we did the details would be of little\r\n    interest to our general readers, while those who are engaged in the\r\n    leather industry will probably obtain the book for themselves--at\r\n    least they would do well to do so.... Altogether the 'Treatise' has\r\n    evidently been very carefully prepared, and by a man who thoroughly\r\n    knows the subject, and hence it will be a very valuable technical\r\n    book for English firms and workers.'--_Walsall Observer._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n=Books on Pottery, Bricks, Tiles, Glass, etc.=\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=THE MANUAL OF PRACTICAL POTTING.= Revised and Enlarged.

We are often asked to\r\n     recommend books on different subjects, and have no hesitation in\r\n     advising the purchase of the present volume by dyers and calico\r\n     printers, as containing a mass of most useful information at a\r\n     nominal price.\"--_Irish Textile Journal._\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Paterson's work not only clearly deals with the theory of\r\n     colour, but supplies lucid directions for the practical application\r\n     of the theory. His work will be found exceedingly helpful, not only\r\n     to the practical colourist, but also to students in our textile\r\n     colleges, by forming a useful complement to their class lectures.\r\n     There are several exquisitely coloured plates and a large number of\r\n     other illustrations of theory and practice in colour blending, and\r\n     also a series of plates with specimens of dyed fabrics attached, in\r\n     explication of the author's views.\"--_Wakefield Express._\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Paterson has little to say upon the experimental aspect or on\r\n     its æsthetics, but much upon the theory of colour, especially as it\r\n     bears upon the question--an all-important one to dyers, calico\r\n     printers and artists, who have to produce such a variety of shades\r\n     and tints--of the admixture of one colour upon another.... The\r\n     author is a dyer, and in his concluding chapters keeps well before\r\n     him the special wants and requirements of dyers. He writes\r\n     pleasantly and lucidly, and there is no difficulty in following\r\n     him, although here and there a lapse into ambiguousness occurs. The\r\n     book is well printed, generously supplied with coloured plates,\r\n     very nicely if not brightly got up; and the dyed patterns at the\r\n     end enhance the value of the book to the dyer.\"--_Textile Mercury._\r\n\r\n     \"For some time the proprietors of _The Oil and Colourman's Journal_\r\n     have been engaged in the publication of a series of practical\r\n     handbooks intended for the use of those interested in certain\r\n     branches of technology, and the present volume is the latest\r\n     addition to their list. The feature which the works have in\r\n     common--and it is an all-important one in treatises of this\r\n     sort--is their eminently practical character. The primary aim of\r\n     the publishers is to provide scientific text-books which will be\r\n     helpful to those who are either actively engaged in the practice of\r\n     the arts in question, or who are studying with that immediate end\r\n     in view.... Mr. Paterson speaks with that assured knowledge of an\r\n     expert, and in the present volume, as in that which he has already\r\n     contributed to the same series, he sets forth the true foundation\r\n     of the art of colouring in a manner at once comprehensive and\r\n     judicious.... For dyers, calico printers and colourists in general,\r\n     whose desire it is to work with accuracy in their respective\r\n     branches, the treatise will prove an invaluable guide-book,\r\n     provided the principles and methods it describes are studied with\r\n     intelligence and care. To this end, every encouragement has been\r\n     given that well-chosen examples, carefully executed plates and\r\n     diagrams, and an exhaustive index can supply.\"--_Glasgow Herald._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=COLOUR MATCHING ON TEXTILES.= A Manual intended for the use of Students\r\nof Colour Chemistry, Dyeing and Textile Printing.

The volume is at once practical and\r\n    scientific, is well got up, and teems with illustrations and\r\n    statistics.
