This booklet, prepared by two members of the\r\nU.S. Geological Survey, discusses how geologic phenomena are responsible\r\nfor the magnificent scenery of the Teton region.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the complex geologic history of our Earth is vital to the\r\nenjoyment and appreciation of beautiful landscapes and other natural\r\nwonders, to the planning of our cities and highway systems, to the wise\r\nuse of our water supplies, to the study of earthquake and landslide\r\nareas, to the never-ending search for new mineral deposits, and to the\r\nconservation and development of our known natural resources.

Others are longer, wider, and higher, but few\r\ncan rival the breath-taking alpine grandeur of the eastern front of the\r\nTetons. Ridge after jagged ridge of naked rock soar upward into the\r\nwestern sky, culminating in the towering cluster of peaks to which the\r\nearly French voyageurs gave the name “_les Trois Tetons_” (the three\r\nbreasts). The range hangs like a great stone wave poised to break across\r\nthe valley at its base. To the south and east are lesser mountains,\r\ninteresting and scenic but lacking the magic appeal of the Tetons.\r\n\r\nThis is a range of many moods and colors: stark and austere in morning\r\nsun, but gold and purple and black in the softly lengthening shadows of\r\nafternoon; somber and foreboding when the peaks wrap themselves in the\r\ntattered clouds of an approaching storm, but tranquil and ethereal blue\r\nand silver beneath a full moon.\r\n\r\nThese great peaks and much of the floor of the valley to the east,\r\n_Jackson Hole_ (a _hole_ was the term used by pioneer explorers and\r\nmountain men to describe any open valley encircled by mountains), lie\r\nwithin Grand Teton National Park, protected and preserved for the\r\nenjoyment of present and future generations. Each year more than 3\r\nmillion visitors come to the park. Many pause briefly and pass on.\r\nOthers stay to explore its trails, fish its streams, study the plants\r\nand wildlife that abound within its borders, or to savor the colorful\r\nhuman history of this area.\r\n\r\nMost visitors, whatever their interests and activities, are probably\r\nfirst attracted to the park by its unsurpassed mountain scenery. The\r\njagged panorama of the Tetons is the backdrop to which they may turn\r\nagain and again, asking questions, seeking answers. How did the\r\nmountains form? How long have they towered into the clouds, washed by\r\nrain, riven by frost, swept by wind and snow? What enormous forces\r\nbrought them forth and raised them skyward? What stories are chronicled\r\nin their rocks, what epics chiseled in the craggy visage of this\r\nmountain landscape? Why are the Tetons different from other mountains?\r\n\r\n\r\n                     First questions, brief answers\r\n\r\n_How did the Tetons and Jackson Hole form?_ They are both tilted blocks\r\nof the earth’s crust that behaved like two adjoining giant trapdoors\r\nhinged so that they would swing in opposite directions. The block on the\r\nwest, which forms the Teton Range, was hinged along the Idaho-Wyoming\r\nState line; the eastern edge was uplifted along a fault (a fracture\r\nalong which displacement has occurred). This is why the highest peaks\r\nand steepest faces are near the east margin of the range. The hinge line\r\nof the eastern block, which forms Jackson Hole, was in the highlands to\r\nthe east. The western edge of the block is downdropped along the fault\r\nat the base of the Teton Range. As a consequence, the floor of Jackson\r\nHole tilts westward toward the Tetons (see cross section inside back\r\ncover).\r\n\r\n_When did the Tetons and Jackson Hole develop the spectacular scenery we\r\nsee today?_ The Tetons are the youngest of all the mountain ranges in\r\nthe Rocky Mountain chain. Most other mountains in the region are at\r\nleast 50 million years old but the Tetons are less than 10 million and\r\nare still rising. Jackson Hole is of the same age and is still sinking.\r\nThe Teton landscape is the product of many earth processes, the most\r\nrecent of which is cutting by water and ice. Within the last 15,000\r\nyears, ice sculpturing of peaks and canyons and impounding of glacial\r\nlakes have added finishing touches to the scenic beauty.\r\n\r\n_Why did the Tetons rise and Jackson Hole sink?_ For thousands of years\r\nmen have wondered about the origin of mountains and their speculations\r\nhave filled many books. Two of the more popular theories are: (1)\r\ncontinental drift (such as South America moving away from Africa), with\r\nthe upper lighter layer of the earth’s crust moving over the lower\r\ndenser layer and wrinkling along belts of weakness; and (2) convection\r\ncurrents within the earth, caused by heat transfer, resulting in linear\r\nzones of wrinkling, uplift, and collapse.\r\n\r\nThese concepts were developed to explain the origin of mountainous areas\r\nhundreds or thousands of miles long but they do not answer directly the\r\nquestion of why the Tetons rose and Jackson Hole sank. As is discussed\r\nin the chapter on mountains, it is probable that semifluid rock far\r\nbelow the surface of Jackson Hole flowed north into the Yellowstone\r\nVolcanic Plateau-Absaroka Range volcanic area, perhaps taking the place\r\nof the enormous amount of ash and lava blown out of volcanoes during the\r\nlast 50 million years. The origin of the line of weakness that marks the\r\nTeton fault along the east face of the Teton Range may go back to some\r\nunknown inequality in the earth’s composition several billion years ago.\r\nWhy it suddenly became active late in the earth’s history is an\r\nunanswered question.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate source of heat and energy that caused the mountains and\r\nbasins to form probably is disintegration of radioactive materials deep\r\nwithin the earth. The Tetons are a spectacular demonstration that the\r\nenormous energy necessary to create mountains is not declining, even\r\nthough our planet is several billion years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         An extraordinary story\r\n\r\nVisitors whose curiosity is whetted by this unusual and varied panorama\r\nare not satisfied with only a few questions and answers. They sense that\r\nhere for the asking is an extraordinary _geologic_ (_geo_—earth;\r\n_logic_—science) story. With a little direction, many subtle features\r\nbecome evident—features that otherwise might escape notice. Here, for\r\nexample, is a valley with an odd U-shape. There is a sheer face\r\ncrisscrossed with light- and dark-colored rocks. On the valley floor is\r\na tuft of pine trees that seem to be confined to one particular kind of\r\nrock. On the rolling hills is a layer of peculiar white soil—the only\r\nsoil in which coyote dens are common. All these are geologically\r\ncontrolled phenomena. In short, with a bit of initial guidance, the\r\nviewer gains an ability to observe and to understand so much that the\r\npanorama takes on new depth, vividness, and excitement. It changes from\r\na flat, two-dimensional picture to a colorful multi-dimensional exhibit\r\nof the earth’s history.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1. _The Tetons from afar—an astronaut’s view\r\n    of the range and adjacent mountains, basins, and plateaus.

Stacy._\r\n\r\n    BLOCK DIAGRAM VIEW SOUTHWEST SHOWING THE TETON RANGE AND JACKSON\r\n    HOLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          An astronaut’s view\r\n\r\nThe Tetons are a short, narrow, and high mountain range, distinctive in\r\nthe midst of the great chain of the Rocky Mountains, the backbone of\r\nwestern North America. Figure 1 shows how the Tetons and their\r\nsurroundings might appear if you viewed them from a satellite at an\r\naltitude of perhaps a hundred miles. The U. S. Geological Survey\r\ntopographic map of Grand Teton National Park shows the names of many\r\nfeatures not indicated on figure 1 or on the geologic map inside the\r\nback cover. The Teton Range is a rectangular mountain block about 40\r\nmiles long and 10-15 miles wide. It is flanked on the east and west by\r\nflat-floored valleys. Jackson Hole is the eastern one and Teton Basin\r\n(called Pierre’s Hole by the early trappers) is the western.\r\n\r\nThe Teton Range is not symmetrical. The highest peaks lie near the\r\neastern edge of the mountain block, rather than along its center, as is\r\ntrue in conventional mountains, and the western slopes are broad and\r\ngentle in contrast to the precipitous eastern slopes. The northern end\r\nof the range disappears under enormous lava flows that form the\r\nYellowstone Volcanic Plateau. Even from this altitude the outlines of\r\nsome of these flows can be seen.\r\n\r\nOn the south the Teton Range abuts almost at right angles against a\r\nnorthwest-trending area of lower and less rugged mountains (the Snake\r\nRiver, Wyoming, and Hoback Ranges). These mountains appear altogether\r\ndifferent from the Tetons. They consist of a series of long parallel\r\nridges cut or separated by valleys and canyons. This pattern is\r\ncharacteristic of mountains composed of crumpled, steeply tilted rock\r\nlayers—erosion wears away the softer layers, leaving the harder ones\r\nstanding as ridges.\r\n\r\nOn the east and northeast, Jackson Hole is bounded by the Gros Ventre\r\nand Washakie Ranges, which are composed chiefly of folded hard and soft\r\nsedimentary rocks. In contrast, between these mountains and the deepest\r\npart of Jackson Hole to the west, thick layers of soft nearly flat-lying\r\nsedimentary rocks have been sculptured by streams and ice into randomly\r\noriented knife-edge ridges and rolling hills separated by broad valleys.\r\nThe hills east of the park are called the Mount Leidy Highlands and\r\nthose northeast are the Pinyon Peak Highlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A pilot’s view\r\n\r\nIf you descend from 100 miles to about 5 miles above the Teton region,\r\nthe asymmetry of the range, the extraordinary variety of landscapes, and\r\nthe vivid colors of rocks become more pronounced.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows a panorama of the Teton Range and Jackson Hole from a\r\nvantage point over the Pinyon Peak Highlands. The rough steep slopes and\r\njagged ridges along the east front of the range contrast with smoother\r\nslopes and more rounded ridges on the western side. Nestled at the foot\r\nof the mountains and extending out onto the floor of Jackson Hole are\r\ntree-rimmed sparkling lakes of many sizes and shapes. Still others lie\r\nin steep-sided rocky amphitheaters near the mountain crests.\r\n\r\nOne of the most colorful flight routes into Jackson Hole is from the\r\neast, along the north flank of the Gros Ventre Mountains. For 40 miles\r\nthis mountain range is bounded by broad parallel stripes of bright-red,\r\npink, purple, gray, and brown rocks. Some crop out as cliffs or ridges,\r\nand others are _badlands_ (bare unvegetated hills and valleys with steep\r\nslopes and abundant dry stream channels). In places the soft beds have\r\nbroken loose and flowed down slopes like giant varicolored masses of\r\ntaffy. These are mudflows and landslides. The colorful rocks are bounded\r\non the south by gray and yellow tilted layers forming snowcapped peaks\r\nof the Gros Ventre Mountains.\r\n\r\nThese landscapes are the product of many natural forces acting on a\r\nvariety of rock types during long or short intervals of geologic time.\r\nEach group of rocks records a chapter in the geologic story of the\r\nregion. Other chapters can be read from the tilting, folding, and\r\nbreaking of the rocks. The latest episodes are written on the face of\r\nthe land itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A motorist’s view\r\n\r\nMost park visitors first see the Teton peaks from the highway. Whether\r\nthey drive in from the south, east, or north, there is one point on the\r\nroute at which a spectacular panorama of the Tetons and Jackson Hole\r\nsuddenly appears. Part of the thrill of these three views is that they\r\nare so unexpected and so different. The geologic history is responsible\r\nfor these differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _View north._—\r\n\r\nThroughout the first 4 miles north of the town of Jackson, the view of\r\nthe Tetons from U. S. 26-89 is blocked by East Gros Ventre Butte. At the\r\nnorth end of the butte, the highway climbs onto a flat upland at the\r\nsouth boundary of Grand Teton National Park. Without any advance\r\nwarning, the motorist sees the whole east front of the Teton Range\r\nrising steeply from the amazingly flat floor of Jackson Hole.\r\n\r\nFrom the park boundary turnout no lakes or rivers are visible to the\r\nnorth but the nearest line of trees in the direction of the highest\r\nTeton peaks marks the approximate position of the Gros Ventre River. The\r\nelevation of this river is surprising, for the route has just come up a\r\n150-foot hill, out of the flat valley of a much smaller stream, yet here\r\nat eye-level is a major river perched on an upland plain. The reason for\r\nthese strange relations is that the hill is a fault scarp (see fig. 16A\r\nfor a diagram) and the valley in which the town of Jackson is located\r\nwas dropped 150 feet or more in the last 15,000 years.\r\n\r\nOn the skyline directly west of the turnout are horizontal and inclined\r\nlayers of rocks. These once extended over the tops of the highest peaks\r\nbut were worn away from some parts as the mountains rose. All along the\r\nrange, trees grow only up to _treeline_ (also called _timberline_—a\r\ngeneral elevation above which trees do not grow) which here is about\r\n10,500 feet above the sea. To the southeast and east, beyond the\r\nsage-covered floor of Jackson Hole, are rolling partly forested slopes\r\nmarking the west end of the Gros Ventre Mountains. They do not look at\r\nall like the Tetons because they were formed in a very different manner.\r\nThe Gros Ventres are folded mountains that have foothills; the Tetons\r\nare faulted mountains that do not.\r\n\r\n    Figure 3. _The Teton landscape as seen from Signal Mountain._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A. _View west across Jackson Lake. Major peaks,\r\n    canyons, and outcrops of sedimentary rocks are indicated by “s.”_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: B. _View northeast; a study in contrast with the\r\n    panorama above._]\r\n\r\nThree steepsided hills called _buttes_ rise out of the flat floor of\r\nJackson Hole. They are tilted and faulted masses of hard, layered rock\r\nthat have been shaped by southward-moving glaciers. Six miles north of\r\nthe boundary turnout is Blacktail Butte, on the flanks of which are\r\nwest-dipping white beds. Southwest of the turnout is East Gros Ventre\r\nButte, composed largely of layered rocks that are exposed along the road\r\nfrom Jackson almost to the turnout. These are capped by very young lava\r\nthat forms the brown cliff overlooking the highway at the north end of\r\nthe butte. To the southwest is West Gros Ventre Butte, composed of\r\nsimilar rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _View west._—\r\n\r\nThe motorist traveling west along U. S. 26-287 is treated to two\r\nmagnificent views of the Teton Range. The first is 8 miles and the\r\nsecond 13 miles west of Togwotee Pass. At these vantage points, between\r\n20 and 30 miles from the mountains, the great peaks seem half suspended\r\nbetween earth and sky—too close, almost, to believe, but too distant to\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\nOnly from closer range can the motorist begin to appreciate the size and\r\nsteepness of the mountains and to discern the details of their\r\narchitecture. The many roads on the floor of Jackson Hole furnish\r\never-changing vistas, and signs provided by the National Park Service at\r\nnumerous turnouts and scenic overlooks help the visitor to identify\r\nquickly the major peaks and canyons and the principal features of the\r\nvalley floor. Of all these roadside vantage points, the top of Signal\r\nMountain, an isolated hill rising nearly 1,000 feet out of the east\r\nmargin of Jackson Lake, probably offers the best overall perspective\r\n(fig. 3). To the west, across the shimmering blue waters of Jackson\r\nLake, the whole long parade of rugged peaks stretches from the north\r\nhorizon to the south, many of the higher ones wearing the tattered\r\nremnants of winter snow. From here, only 8 miles away, the towering\r\npinnacles, saw-toothed ridges, and deep U-shaped canyons are clearly\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other great mountain ranges, the Tetons rise steeply from\r\nthe flat valley floor in a straight unbroken line. The high central\r\npeaks tower more than a mile above the valley, but northward and\r\nsouthward the peaks diminish in height and lose their jagged character,\r\ngradually giving way to lower ridges and rounded hills. Some of the\r\ndetails of the mountain rock can be seen—gnarled gray rocks of the high\r\npeaks threaded by a fine white lacework of dikes, the dark band that\r\ncleaves through Mount Moran from base to summit, and the light brown and\r\ngray layers on the northern and southern parts of the range.\r\n\r\nAt first glance the floor of Jackson Hole south of Signal Mountain seems\r\nflat, smooth, and featureless, except for the Snake River that cuts\r\ndiagonally across it. Nevertheless, even the flats show a variety of\r\nland forms. The broad sage-covered areas, low isolated hills, and\r\nhummocky tree-studded ridges that form the foreground are all parts of\r\nthe Teton landscape, and give us clues to the natural processes that\r\nshaped it. A critical look to the south discloses more strange things.\r\nWe take for granted the fact that the sides of normal valleys slope\r\ninward toward a central major stream. South of Signal Mountain, however,\r\nthe visitor can see that the Snake River Valley does not fit this\r\ndescription. The broad flat west of the river should slope east but it\r\ndoes not. Instead, it has been tilted westward by downward movement\r\nalong the Teton fault at the base of the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _View south._—\r\n\r\nAbout a million motorists drive south from Yellowstone to Grand Teton\r\nNational Park each year. As they wind along the crooked highway on the\r\nwest brink of Lewis River Canyon (fig. 1), the view south is everywhere\r\nblocked by dense forest. Then, abruptly the road leaves the canyon,\r\nstraightens out, and one can look south down a 3-mile sloping avenue cut\r\nthrough the trees. There, 20 to 30 miles away, framed by the roadway,\r\nare the snow-capped Tetons, with Jackson Lake, luminous in reflected\r\nlight, nestled against the east face. This is one of the loveliest and\r\nmost unusual views of the mountains that is available to the motorist,\r\npartly because he is 800 feet above the level of Jackson Lake and partly\r\nbecause this is the only place on a main highway where he can see\r\nclearly the third dimension (width) of the Tetons. The high peaks are on\r\nthe east edge; they rise 7,000 feet above the lake but other peaks and\r\nprecipitous ridges, progressively diminishing in height, extend on to\r\nthe west for a dozen miles (fig. 14). Giant, relatively young lava\r\nflows, into which the Lewis River Canyon was cut, poured southward all\r\nthe way to the shore of Jackson Lake and buried the north end of the\r\nTeton Range (figs. 13 and 53). South of Yellowstone Park these flows\r\nwere later tilted and broken by the dropping of Jackson Hole and the\r\nrise of the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A mountaineer’s view\r\n\r\nAs in many pursuits in life, the greatest rewards of a visit to the\r\nTetons come to those who expend a real effort to earn them. Only by\r\nleaving the teeming valley and going up into the mountains to hike the\r\ntrails and climb the peaks can the visitor come to know the Tetons in\r\nall their moods and changes and view close at hand the details of this\r\nmagnificent mountain edifice.\r\n\r\nEven a short hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point affords an\r\nopportunity for a more intimate view of the mountains. Along the trail\r\nthe hiker can examine outcrops of sugary white granite, glittering\r\nmica-studded dikes, and dark intricately layered rocks. Nearby are great\r\npiles of broken fragments that have fallen from the cliffs above, and\r\nthe visitor can begin to appreciate how vulnerable are the towering\r\ncrags to the relentless onslaught of frost and snow. The roar of the\r\nfoaming stream and the thunder of the falls are constant reminders of\r\nthe patient work of running water in wearing away the “everlasting\r\nhills.” Running his hand across one of the smoothly polished rock faces\r\nbelow Inspiration Point, the hiker gains an unforgettable concept of the\r\npower of glacial ice and its importance in shaping this majestic\r\nlandscape. Looking back across Jenny Lake at the encircling ridge of\r\nglacial debris, he can easily comprehend the size of the ancient glacier\r\nthat once flowed down Cascade Canyon and emerged onto the floor of\r\nJackson Hole.\r\n\r\nThe more ambitious hiker or mountaineer can seek out the inner recesses\r\nof the range and explore other facets of its geology. He can visit the\r\njewel-like mountain lakes—Solitude, Holly, and Amphitheater are just a\r\nfew—cradled in high remote basins left by the Ice Age glaciers. He can\r\nget a closeup view of the Teton Glacier above Amphitheater Lake, or\r\nexplore the Schoolroom Glacier, the tiny ice body below Hurricane Pass.\r\nHe may follow the trail into Garnet Canyon to see the crystals from\r\nwhich the canyon takes its name and to examine the soaring ribbonlike\r\nblack dike near the end of the trail. In Alaska Basin he can study the\r\ngently tilted layers of sandstone, limestone, and shale that once\r\nblanketed the entire Teton Range and can search for the fossils that\r\nhelp determine their age and decipher their history. From Hurricane Pass\r\nhe can see how these even layers of sedimentary rock have been broken\r\nand displaced and how the older harder rocks that form the highest Teton\r\npeaks have been raised far above them along the Buck Mountain fault.\r\n\r\nOf all those who explore the high country, it is the mountaineer who has\r\nperhaps the greatest opportunity to appreciate its geologic story.\r\nIndeed, the success of his climb and his very life may depend on an\r\nintuitive grasp of the mountain geology and the processes that shaped\r\nthe peaks. He observes the most intimate details—the inclination of the\r\njoints and fractures, which gullies are swept by falling rocks, which\r\nprojecting knobs are firm, and which cracks will safely take a piton. To\r\nmany climbers the ascent of a peak is a challenge to technical\r\ncompetence, endurance, and courage, but to those endowed with curiosity\r\nand a sharp eye it can be much more. As he stands shoulder to shoulder\r\nwith the clouds on some windswept peak, such as the Grand Teton, with\r\nthe awesome panorama dropping away on all sides, he can hardly avoid\r\nasking how this came to be. What does the mountaineer see that inspires\r\nthis curiosity? From the very first glance, it is apparent that the\r\nscenes to the north, south, east, and west are startlingly different.\r\n\r\nLooking west from the rough, narrow, weather-ravaged granite summit of\r\nthe Grand Teton, one sees far below him the layered gray cliffs of\r\n_marine sedimentary rocks_ (solidified sediment originally deposited in\r\na shallow arm of the ocean) overlapping the granite and dipping gently\r\nwest, finally disappearing under the checkerboard farmland of Teton\r\nBasin. Still farther west are the rolling timbered slopes of the Big\r\nHole Range in Idaho. A glance at the foreground, 3,000 feet below, shows\r\nsome unusual relations of the streams to the mountains. The watershed\r\ndivide of the Teton Range is not marked by the highest peaks as one\r\nwould expect. Streams in Cascade Canyon and in other canyons to the\r\nnorth and south begin west of the peaks, bend around them, then flow\r\neastward in deep narrow gorges cut through the highest part of the\r\nrange, and emerge onto the flat floor of Jackson Hole.\r\n\r\nIn the view north along the crest of the Teton Range, the asymmetry of\r\nthe mountains is most apparent. The steep east face culminating in the\r\nhighest peaks contrasts with the lower more gentle west flank of the\r\nuplift. From the Grand Teton it is not possible to see the actual place\r\nwhere the mountains disappear under the lavas of Yellowstone Park, but\r\nthe heavily timbered broad gentle surface of the lava plain is visible\r\nbeyond the peaks and extends across the entire north panorama. Still\r\nfarther north, 75 to 100 miles away, rise the snowcapped peaks (from\r\nnorthwest to northeast) of the Madison, Gallatin, and Beartooth\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThe view east presents the greatest contrasts in the shortest\r\ndistances—the flat floor of Jackson Hole is 3 miles away and 7,000 feet\r\nbelow the top of the Grand Teton. Along the junction of the mountains\r\nand valley floor are blue glacial lakes strung out like irregular beads\r\nin a necklace. They are conspicuously rimmed by black-appearing margins\r\nof pine trees that grow only on the surrounding glacial moraines. Beyond\r\nthese are the broad treeless boulder-strewn plains of Jackson Hole.\r\nFifty miles to the east and northeast, on the horizon beyond the rolling\r\nhills of the Pinyon Peak Highlands, are the horizontally layered\r\nvolcanic rocks of the Absaroka Range. Southeast is the colorful red,\r\npurple, green, and gray Gros Ventre River Valley, with the fresh giant\r\nscar of the Lower Gros Ventre Slide near its mouth. Bounding the south\r\nside of this valley are the peaks of the Gros Ventre Mountains, whose\r\ntilted slabby gray cliff-forming layers resemble (and are the same as)\r\nthose on the west flank of the Teton Range. Seventy miles away, in the\r\nsoutheast distance, beyond the Gros Ventre Mountains are the shining\r\nsnowcapped peaks of the Wind River Range, the highest peak of which\r\n(Gannett Peak) is about 20 feet higher than the Grand Teton.\r\n\r\nConspicuous on the eastern and southeastern skyline are high-level\r\n(11,000-12,000 feet) flat-topped surfaces on both the Wind River and\r\nAbsaroka Ranges. These are remnants that mark the upper limit of\r\nsedimentary fill of the basins adjacent to the mountains. A plain once\r\nconnected these surfaces and extended westward at least as far as the\r\nconspicuous flat on the mountain south of Lower Gros Ventre Slide. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine the amount of rock that has been washed away from\r\nbetween these remnants in comparatively recent geologic time, during and\r\nafter the rise of the Teton Range.\r\n\r\nFrom this vantage point the mountaineer also gets a concept of the\r\nmagnitude of the first and largest glaciers that scoured the landscape.\r\nIce flowed southwestward in an essentially unbroken stream from the\r\nBeartooth Mountains, 100 miles away, westward from the Absaroka Range,\r\nand northwestward from the Wind River Range (fig. 57). Ice lapped up to\r\ntreeline on the Teton Range and extended across Jackson Hole nearly to\r\nthe top of the Lower Gros Ventre Slide. The Pinyon Peak and Mount Leidy\r\nHighlands were almost buried. All these glaciers came together in\r\nJackson Hole and flowed south within the ever-narrowing Snake River\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nThe view south presents a great variety of contrasts. Conspicuous, as in\r\nthe view north, is the asymmetry of the range. South of the high peaks\r\nof crystalline rocks, gray layered cliffs of limestone extend in places\r\nall the way to the steep east face of the Teton Range where they are\r\nabruptly cut off by the great Teton fault.\r\n\r\nThe flat treeless floor of Jackson Hole narrows southward. Rising out of\r\nthe middle are the previously described steepsided ice-scoured rocky\r\nbuttes. Beginning near the town of Jackson, part of which is visible,\r\nand extending as far south as the eye can see are row upon row of sharp\r\nridges and snowcapped peaks that converge at various angles. These are\r\nthe Hoback, Wyoming, Salt River, and Snake River Ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CARVING THE RUGGED PEAKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rugged grandeur of the Tetons is a product of four geologic factors:\r\nthe tough hard rocks in the core, the amount of vertical uplift, the\r\nrecency of the mountain-making movement, and the dynamic forces of\r\ndestruction. Many other mountains in Wyoming have just as hard rocks in\r\ntheir cores and an equally great amount of vertical uplift, but they\r\nrose 50 to 60 million years ago and have been worn down by erosion from\r\nthat time on. The Tetons, on the other hand, are the youngest range in\r\nWyoming, less than 10 million years old, and have not had time to be so\r\ndeeply eroded.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Steep mountain slopes—the perpetual battleground\r\n\r\nAny steep slope or cliff is especially vulnerable to nature’s methods of\r\ndestruction. In the Tetons we see the never-ending struggle between two\r\nconflicting factors. The first is the extreme toughness of the rocks and\r\ntheir consequent resistance to erosion. The second is the presence of\r\nefficient transporting agencies that move out and away from the\r\nmountains all rock debris that might otherwise bury the lower slopes.\r\n\r\nThe rocks making up most of the Teton Range are among the hardest,\r\ntoughest, and least porous known. Therefore, they resist mechanical\r\ndisintegration by temperature changes, ice, and water. They consist\r\npredominantly of minerals that are subject to very little chemical decay\r\nin the cold climate of the Tetons.\r\n\r\nAbsence of weak layers prevents breaking of the tough rock masses under\r\ntheir own weight. All these conditions, then, are favorable for\r\npreservation of steep walls and high rock pinnacles. Nevertheless, they\r\ndo break down. Great piles of broken rock _(talus)_ that festoon the\r\nslopes of all the higher peaks bear witness to the unrelenting assault\r\nby the process of erosion upon the mountain citadels (figs. 4 and 31).\r\n\r\n\r\n             Rock disintegration and gravitational movement\r\n\r\nA great variation in both daily and annual temperatures results in\r\nminute amounts of contraction and expansion of rock particles. Repeated\r\nchanges in volume produce stress and strain. Although the rocks in the\r\nTetons are very dense, they eventually yield; a crack forms. Water which\r\nseeps in along this surface of weakness freezes, either overnight or\r\nduring long cold spells, and expands, thereby prying a slab of rock away\r\nfrom the mountain wall. Repeated _frost wedging_, as the process is\r\ncalled, results eventually in tipping the slab so that it falls.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. _Talus at the foot of the jagged\r\n    frost-riven peaks around Ice Floe Lake in the south fork of Cascade\r\n    Canyon. Photo by Philip Hyde._]\r\n\r\nWhat happens to the rock slab? It may fall and roll several hundred or\r\nthousand feet, depending on the steepness of the mountain surface.\r\nPieces are broken off as it encounters obstacles. All the fragments find\r\ntheir way to a valley floor or slope, where they momentarily come to\r\nrest. Thus, rock debris is moved significant and easily observed\r\ndistances by gravity.\r\n\r\nNone of this debris is stationary. If it is mixed with snow or saturated\r\nwith water, the whole mass may slowly flow in the same manner as a\r\nglacier. These are called _rock glaciers_; some can be seen on the south\r\nside of Granite Canyon and one, nearly a mile long, is in the valley\r\nnorth of Eagles Rest Peak.\r\n\r\nThe countless snow avalanches that thunder down the mountain flanks\r\nafter heavy winter snowfalls play their part, too, in gravitational\r\ntransport. Loose rocks and debris are incorporated with the moving snow\r\nand borne down the mountainsides to the talus piles below. Trees,\r\nbushes, and soil are swept from the sites of the slides, leaving\r\nconspicuous scars down the slopes and exposing new rock surfaces to the\r\nattack of water and frost. Battered, broken, and uprooted trees along\r\nmany of the canyon trails bear silent witness to the awesome power of\r\nsnowslides.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the methods used by Nature in making debris and then,\r\nby means of gravity, clearing it from the mountain slopes. There are\r\nother ways, too. A weak layer of rock (usually one with a lot of clay in\r\nit), parallel to and underlying a mountain slope, may occur between two\r\nhard layers. An extended rainy spell may result in saturation of the\r\nweak zone so that it is well lubricated; then an earthquake or perhaps\r\nmerely the weight of the overlying rock sends the now unstable mass\r\ncascading down the slope to the valley below. The famous Lower Gros\r\nVentre Slide (fig. 5) was formed in this way on June 23, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Running water cuts and carries\r\n\r\nRunning water is another effective agent that transports rock debris and\r\nhas helped dissect the Teton Range. The damage a broken water main can\r\nwreak on a roadbed is well known, as is the havoc of destructive floods.\r\nThe spring floods of streams in the Tetons, swollen by melting snow and\r\nice (annual precipitation, mostly snow, in the high parts would average\r\na layer of water 5 feet thick), move some rock debris onto the adjoining\r\nfloor of Jackson Hole.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5. _The Lower Gros Ventre slide, air oblique\r\n    view south. The top of the scar is 2,000 feet above the river; the\r\n    slide is more than a mile long and one-half mile wide. It dammed the\r\n    Gros Ventre River in the foreground, impounding a lake about 200\r\n    feet deep and 5 miles long. Gros Ventre Mountains are in the\r\n    distance. Photo by P. E. Millward._]\r\n\r\nNow and then the range is deluged by summer cloudbursts. Water funnels\r\ndown the maze of gullies on the mountainsides, quickly gathering volume\r\nand power, and plunges on to the talus slopes below, as if from gigantic\r\nhoses. The sudden onslaught of these torrents of water on the saturated\r\nunstable talus may trigger enormous rock and mudflows that carry vast\r\nquantities of material down into the canyons. During the summer of 1941\r\nmore than 100 of these flows occurred in the park.\r\n\r\nWherever water moves, it carries rock fragments varying in size from\r\nboulders to sand grains and on down to minute clay particles. _Erosion_\r\n(wearing away) by streams is conspicuous wherever the water is muddy, as\r\nit always is each spring in the Snake, Buffalo Fork, and Gros Ventre\r\nRivers. Clear mountain streams likewise can erode. Although the volume\r\nof material moved and the amount of downcutting of the stream bottom may\r\nnot seem great in a single stream, the cumulative effect of many streams\r\nin an area, year after year and century after century, is enormous.\r\nStreams not only transport rocks brought to them by gravitational\r\nmovement but also continually widen and deepen their valleys, thereby\r\nincreasing the volume of transported debris.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of streams as transporting agents in the Tetons is\r\nenhanced by steep _gradients_ (slopes); these increase water velocity\r\nwhich in turn expands the capability of the streams to carry larger and\r\nlarger rock fragments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Glaciers scour and transport\r\n\r\nMountain landscapes shaped by frost action, gravitational transport, and\r\nstream erosion alone generally have rounded summits, smooth slopes, and\r\nV-shaped valleys. The jagged ridges, sharply pointed peaks, and deep\r\nU-shaped valleys of the Tetons show that glaciers have played an\r\nimportant role in their sculpture. The small present-day glaciers still\r\ncradled in shaded recesses among the higher peaks (fig. 6) are but\r\nminiature replicas of great ice streams that occupied the region during\r\nthe Ice Age. Evidence both here and in other parts of the world confirms\r\nthat glaciers were once far more extensive than they are today.\r\n\r\nGlaciers form wherever more snow accumulates during the winter than is\r\nmelted during the summer. Gradually the piles of snow solidify to form\r\nice, which begins to flow under its own weight. Rocks that have fallen\r\nfrom the surrounding ridges or have been picked up from the underlying\r\nbedrock are incorporated in the moving ice mass and carried along. The\r\nability of ice to transport huge volumes of rock is easily observed even\r\nin the small present-day glaciers in the Tetons, all of which carry\r\nabundant rock fragments both on and within the ice.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6. _The Teton Glacier on the north side of\r\n    Grand Teton, air oblique view west. Photo by A. S. Post, August 19,\r\n    1963._]\r\n\r\nRecent measurements show that the ice in the present Teton Glacier (fig.\r\n6) moves nearly 30 feet per year. The ancient glaciers, which were much\r\nwider and deeper, may have moved as much as several hundred feet a year,\r\nlike some of the large glaciers in Alaska.\r\n\r\nAs the glacier moves down a valley, it scours the valley bottom and\r\nwalls. The efficiency of ice in this process is greatly increased by the\r\npresence of rock fragments which act as abrasives. The valley bottom is\r\nplowed, quarried, and swept clean of soil and loose rocks. Fragments of\r\nmany sizes and shapes are dragged along the bottom of the moving ice and\r\nthe hard ones scratch long parallel grooves in the underlying tough\r\nbedrock (fig. 7). Such grooves (_glacial striae_) record the direction\r\nof ice movement.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of glaciers in cutting a U-shaped valley is\r\nparticularly striking in Glacier Gulch and Cascade Canyon (figs. 2 and\r\n8).\r\n\r\nThe rock-walled amphitheater at the head of a glaciated valley is called\r\na _cirque_ (a good example is at the upper edge of the Teton Glacier,\r\nfig. 6). The steep cirque walls develop by frost action and by quarrying\r\nand abrasive action of the glacier ice where it is near its maximum\r\nthickness. Commonly the glacier scoops out a shallow basin in the floor\r\nof the cirque. Amphitheater Lake, Lake Solitude, Holly Lake, and many of\r\nthe other small lakes high in the Teton Range are located in such\r\nbasins.\r\n\r\nThe sharp peaks and the jagged knife-edge ridges so characteristic of\r\nthe Tetons are divides left between cirques and valleys carved by the\r\nancient glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Effects on Jackson Hole\r\n\r\nRock debris is carried toward the end of the glacier or along the\r\nmargins where it is released as the ice melts. The semicircular ridge of\r\nrock fragments that marks the downhill margin of the glacier is called a\r\n_terminal moraine_; that along the sides is a _lateral moraine_ (figs. 9\r\nand 10). These are formed by the slow accumulation of material in the\r\nsame manner as that at the end of a conveyor belt. They are not built by\r\nmaterial pushed up ahead of the ice as if by a bulldozer. Large boulders\r\ncarried by ice are called _erratics_; many of these are scattered on the\r\nfloor of Jackson Hole and on the flanks of the surrounding mountains\r\n(fig. 11).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 7. _Rock surface polished and grooved by ice\r\n    on the floor of Glacier Gulch._]\r\n\r\nGreat volumes of water pour from melting ice near the lower end of a\r\nglacier. These streams, heavily laden with rock flour produced by the\r\ngrinding action of the glacier and with debris liberated from the\r\nmelting ice, cut channels through the terminal moraine and spread a\r\nbroad apron of gravel, sand, and silt down-valley from the glacier\r\nterminus (end). Material deposited by streams issuing from a glacier is\r\ncalled _outwash_; the sheet of outwash in front of the glacier is called\r\nan _outwash plain_. If the terminus is retreating, masses of old\r\nstagnant ice commonly are buried beneath the outwash; when these melt,\r\nthe space they once occupied becomes a deep circular or irregular\r\ndepression called a _kettle_ (fig. 12); many of these now contain small\r\nlakes or swamps.\r\n\r\nAs a glacier retreats, it may build a series of terminal moraines,\r\nmarking pauses in the recession of the ice front. Streams issuing from\r\nthe ice behind each new terminal moraine are incised more and more\r\ndeeply into the older moraines and their outwash plains. Thus, new and\r\nyounger layers of bouldery debris are spread at successively lower and\r\nlower levels. These surfaces are called _outwash terraces_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8. _East face of the Teton Range showing some\r\n    of the glacial features, air oblique view.

The mountains are being\r\ndestroyed. Although the processes of destruction may seem slow to us, we\r\nknow they have been operating for millions of years—so why have the\r\nmountains not been leveled? How did they form in the first place?\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Kinds of mountains\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of mountains. Some are piles of lava and debris\r\nerupted from a volcano. Others are formed by the bowing up of the\r\nearth’s crust in the shape of a giant dome or elongated arch. Still\r\nothers are remnants of accumulated sedimentary rocks that once filled a\r\nbasin between preexisting mountains and which are now partially worn\r\naway. An example of this type is the Absaroka Range 40 miles northeast\r\nof the Tetons (figs. 1 and 52).\r\n\r\nThe Tetons are a still different kind—a _fault block mountain range_\r\ncarved from a segment of the earth’s crust that has been uplifted along\r\na fault. The _Teton fault_ is approximately at the break in slope where\r\nthe eastern foot of the range joins the flats at the west edge of\r\nJackson Hole (see map inside back cover), but in most places is\r\nconcealed beneath glacial deposits and debris shed from the adjacent\r\nsteep slopes. The shape of the range and its relation to Jackson Hole\r\nhave already been described. Clues as to the presence of the fault are:\r\n(1) the straight and deep east face of the Teton Range, (2) absence of\r\nfoothills, (3) asymmetry of the range (fig. 14), and (4) small _fault\r\nscarps_ (cliffs or steep slopes formed by faulting) along the mountain\r\nfront (fig. 15).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 14. _Air oblique view south showing the width\r\n    and asymmetry of Teton Range. Grand Teton is left of center and Mt.\r\n    Moran is the broad humpy peak still farther left. Photo taken\r\n    October 1, 1965_.]\r\n\r\nRecent geophysical surveys of Jackson Hole combined with data from deep\r\nwells drilled in search of oil and gas east of the park also yield\r\nvaluable clues. By measuring variations in the earth’s magnetic field\r\nand in the pull of gravity and by studying the speed of shock waves\r\ngenerated by small dynamite explosions, Dr. John C. Behrendt of the U.\r\nS. Geological Survey has determined the depth and tilt of rock layers\r\nburied beneath the veneer of glacial debris and stream-laid sand and\r\ngravel on the valley floor. This information was used in constructing\r\nthe geologic cross section in the back of the booklet. The same rock\r\nlayers that cap the summit of Mount Moran (fig. 27) are buried at depths\r\nof nearly 24,000 feet beneath the nearby floor of Jackson Hole but are\r\ncut off by the Teton fault at the west edge of the valley. Thus the\r\napproximate amount of movement along the fault here would be about\r\n30,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Anatomy of faults\r\n\r\nThe preceding discussion shows that the Tetons are an upfaulted mountain\r\nblock. Why is this significant? The extreme youth of the Teton fault,\r\nits large amount of displacement, and the fact that the newly upfaulted\r\nangular mountain block was subjected to intense glaciation are among the\r\nprime factors responsible for the development of the magnificent alpine\r\nscenery of the Teton Range. An understanding of the anatomy of faults\r\nis, therefore, pertinent.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 15. _Recent fault scarp (arrows indicate base)\r\n    offsetting alluvial fan at foot of Rockchuck Peak.

Mebane._]\r\n\r\nA fault is a plane or zone in the earth’s crust along which the rocks on\r\none side have moved in relation to the rocks on the other. There are\r\nvarious kinds of faults just as there are various types of mountains.\r\nThree principal types of faults are present in the Teton region: normal\r\nfaults, reverse faults, and thrust faults. A _normal fault_ (fig. 16A)\r\nis a steeply _dipping_ (steeply inclined) fault along which rocks above\r\nthe fault have moved _down_ relative to those beneath it. A _reverse\r\nfault_ (fig. 16B) is a steeply inclined fault along which the rocks\r\nabove the fault have moved _up_ relative to those below it. A _thrust\r\nfault_ (fig. 16C) is a gently inclined fault along which the principal\r\nmovement has been more nearly horizontal than vertical.\r\n\r\nNormal faults may be the result of tension or pulling apart of the\r\nearth’s crust or they may be caused by adjustment of the rigid crust to\r\nthe flow of semi-fluid material below. The crust sags or collapses in\r\nareas from which the subcrustal material has flowed and is bowed up and\r\nstretched in areas where excess subcrustal material has accumulated. In\r\nboth areas the adjustments may result in normal faults.\r\n\r\nReverse faults are generally caused by compression of a rigid block of\r\nthe crust, but some may also be due to lateral flow of subcrustal\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThrust faults are commonly associated with tightly bent or folded rocks.\r\nMany of them are apparently caused by severe compression of part of the\r\ncrust, but some are thought to have formed at the base of slides of\r\nlarge rock masses that moved from high areas into adjacent low areas\r\nunder the influence of gravity.\r\n\r\nThe Teton fault (see cross section inside back cover) is a normal fault;\r\nthe Buck Mountain fault, which lies west of the main peaks of the Teton\r\nRange, is a reverse fault. No thrust faults have been recognized in the\r\nTeton Range, but the mountains south and southwest of the Tetons (fig.\r\n1) display several enormous thrust faults along which masses of rocks\r\nmany miles in extent have moved tens of miles eastward and\r\nnortheastward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Time and rate of uplift\r\n\r\nWhen did the Tetons rise?\r\n\r\nA study of the youngest sedimentary rocks on the floor of Jackson Hole\r\nshows that the Teton Range began to rise rapidly and take its present\r\nshape less than 9 million years ago. The towering peaks themselves are\r\ndirect evidence that the rate of uplift far exceeded the rate at which\r\nthe rising block was worn away by erosion. The mountains are still\r\nrising, and comparatively rapidly, as is indicated by small faults\r\ncutting the youngest deposits (fig. 15).\r\n\r\nHow rapidly? Can the rate be measured?\r\n\r\nWe know that in less than 9 million years (and probably in less than 7\r\nmillion years) there has been 25,000 to 30,000 feet of displacement on\r\nthe Teton fault. This is an average of about 1 foot in 300-400 years.\r\nThe movement probably was not continuous but came as a series of jerks\r\naccompanied by violent earthquakes. One fault on the floor of Jackson\r\nHole near the southern boundary of the park moved 150 feet in the last\r\n15,000 years, an average of 1 foot per 100 years.\r\n\r\nIn view of this evidence of recent crustal unrest, it is not surprising\r\nthat small earthquakes are frequent in the Teton region. More violent\r\nones can probably be expected from time to time.\r\n\r\n    Figure 16. _Types of faults._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A.—Normal fault (tensional)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: B.—Reverse fault (compressional)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: C.—Thrust fault (compressional)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Why are mountains here?\r\n\r\nWhy did the Tetons form where they are?\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this booklet we discussed briefly the two most\r\ncommon theories of origin of mountains: continental drift and convection\r\ncurrents. The question of why mountains are where they are and more\r\nspecifically why the Tetons are here remains a continuing scientific\r\nchallenge regardless of the wealth of data already accumulated in our\r\nstorehouse of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the earth’s crust is an established fact. Despite its\r\napparent rigidity, laboratory experiments demonstrate that rocks flow\r\nwhen subjected to extremely high pressures and temperatures. If the\r\nstress exceeds the strength at a given pressure and temperature, the\r\nrock breaks. Flowing and fracturing are two of the ways by which rocks\r\nadjust to the changing environments at various levels in the earth’s\r\ncrust. These acquired characteristics, some of which can be duplicated\r\nin the laboratory, are guides by which we interpret the geologic history\r\nof rocks that once were deep within the earth.\r\n\r\nThe site of the Teton block no doubt reflects hidden inequalities at\r\ndepth. We cannot see these, nor in this area can we drill below the\r\nouter layer of the earth; nevertheless, measurements of gravity and of\r\nthe earth’s magnetic field clearly show that they exist.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Tetons rose at the time Jackson Hole collapsed but the\r\nvolume of the uplifted block is considerably less than that of the\r\ndowndropped block. This, then, was not just a simple case in which all\r\nthe subcrustal material displaced by the sinking block was squeezed\r\nunder the rising block (the way a hydraulic jack works). What happened\r\nto the rest of the material that once was under Jackson Hole? It could\r\nnot be compressed so it had to go somewhere.\r\n\r\nAs you look northward from the top of the Grand Teton or Mount Moran, or\r\nfrom the main highway at the north edge of Grand Teton National Park,\r\nyou see the great smooth sweep of the volcanic plateau in Yellowstone\r\nNational Park. Farther off to the northeast are the strikingly layered\r\nvolcanic rocks of the Absaroka Range (fig. 52). For these two areas, an\r\nestimate of the volume of volcanic rock that reached the surface and\r\nflowed out, or was blown out and spread far and wide by wind and water,\r\nis considerably in excess of 10,000 cubic miles. On the other hand, this\r\nvolume is many times more than that displaced by the sagging and\r\ndownfaulting of Jackson Hole.\r\n\r\nWhere did the rest of the volcanic material come from? Is it pertinent\r\nto our story? Teton Basin, on the west side of the Teton Range, and the\r\nbroad Snake River downwarp farther to the northwest (fig. 1) are\r\nsufficiently large to have furnished the remainder of the volcanic\r\ndebris. As it was blown out of vents in the Yellowstone-Absaroka area,\r\nits place could have been taken deep underground by material that moved\r\nlaterally from below all three downdropped areas. The movement may have\r\nbeen caused by slow convection currents within the earth, or perhaps by\r\nsome other, as yet unknown, force. The sagging of the earth’s crust on\r\nboth sides of the Teton Range as well as the long-continued volcanism\r\nare certainly directly related to the geologic history of the park.\r\n\r\nIn summary, we theorize as to how the Tetons rose and Jackson Hole sank\r\nbut are not sure why the range is located at this particular place, why\r\nit trends north, why it rose so high, or why this one, of all the\r\nmountain ranges surrounding the Yellowstone-Absaroka volcanic area, had\r\nsuch a unique history of uplift. These are problems to challenge the\r\nminds of generations of earth scientists yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The restless land\r\n\r\nAmong the greatest of the park’s many attractions is the solitude one\r\ncan savor in the midst of magnificent scenery. Only a short walk\r\nseparates us from the highway, torrents of cars, noise, and tension.\r\nAway from these, everything seems restful.\r\n\r\nQuiescent it may seem, yet the landscape is not static but dynamic. This\r\nis one of the many exciting ideas that geology has contributed to\r\nsociety. The concept of the “everlasting hills” is a myth. All the\r\nfeatures around us are actually rather short-lived in terms of geologic\r\ntime. The discerning eye detects again and again the restlessness of the\r\nland. We have discussed many bits of evidence that show how the\r\nlandscape and the earth’s crust beneath it are constantly being carved,\r\npushed up, dropped down, folded, tilted, and faulted.\r\n\r\nThe Teton landscape is a battleground, the scene of a continuing\r\nunresolved struggle between the forces that deform the earth’s crust and\r\nraise the mountains and the slow processes of erosion that strive to\r\nlevel the uplands, fill the hollows, and reduce the landscape to an\r\nultimate featureless plain. The remainder of this booklet is devoted to\r\ntracing the seesaw conflict between these inexorable antagonists through\r\nmore than 2.5 billion years as they shaped the present landscape—and the\r\nbattle still goes on.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the struggle is all around us. Even though to some observers\r\nit may detract from the restfulness of the scene, perhaps it conveys to\r\nall of us a new appreciation of the tremendous dynamic forces\r\nresponsible for the magnificence of the Teton Range.\r\n\r\nThe battle is indicated by the small faults that displace both the land\r\nsurface and young deposits at the east base of Mount Teewinot, Rockchuck\r\nPeak (fig. 15), and other places along the foot of the Tetons.\r\n\r\nJackson Hole continues to drop and tilt. The gravel-covered surfaces\r\nthat originally sloped southward are now tilted westward toward the\r\nmountains. The Snake River, although the major stream, is not in the\r\nlowest part of Jackson Hole; Fish Creek, a lesser tributary near the\r\ntown of Wilson, is 15 feet lower. For 10 miles this creek flows\r\nsouthward parallel to the Snake River but with a gentler gradient, thus\r\npermitting the two streams to join near the south end of Jackson Hole.\r\nAs tilting continues, the Snake River west of Jackson tries to move\r\nwestward but is prevented from doing so by long flood-control levees\r\nbuilt south of the park.\r\n\r\nRecent faults also break the valley floor between the Gros Ventre River\r\nand the town of Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe ever-changing piles of rock debris that mantle the slopes adjacent\r\nto the higher peaks, the creeping advance of rock glaciers, the\r\ndevastating snow avalanches, and the thundering rockfalls are specific\r\nreminders that the land surface is restless. Jackson Hole contains more\r\nlandslides and rock mudflows than almost any other part of the Rocky\r\nMountain region. They constantly plague road builders (fig. 17) and add\r\nto the cost of other types of construction.\r\n\r\nAll of these examples of the relentless battle between constructive and\r\ndestructive processes modifying the Teton landscape are but minor\r\nskirmishes. The bending and breaking of rocks at the surface are small\r\nreflections of enormous stresses and strains deep within the earth where\r\nthe major conflict is being waged. It is revealed every now and then by\r\na convulsion such as the 1959 earthquake in and west of Yellowstone\r\nPark. Events of this type release much more energy than all the nuclear\r\ndevices thus far exploded by man.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 17. _Slide blocking main highway in northern\r\n    part of Grand Teton National Park.

Astronomers deal with\r\ndistances so great that they are almost beyond understanding; nuclear\r\nphysicists study objects so small that we can hardly imagine them.\r\nSimilarly, the geologist is concerned with spans of time so immense that\r\nthey are scarcely comprehensible. Geology is a science of time as well\r\nas rocks, and in our geologic story of the Teton region we must refer\r\nfrequently to the geologic time scale, the yardstick by which we measure\r\nthe vast reaches of time in earth history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Rocks and relative age\r\n\r\nVery early in the science of geology it was recognized that in many\r\nplaces one can tell the comparative ages of rocks by their relations to\r\none another. For example, most _sedimentary rocks_ are consolidated\r\naccumulations of large or small rock fragments and were deposited as\r\nnearly horizontal layers of gravel, sand, or mud. In an undisturbed\r\nsequence of sedimentary rocks, the layer on the bottom was deposited\r\nfirst and the layer on top was deposited last. All of these must, of\r\ncourse, be younger than any previously formed rock fragments\r\nincorporated in them.\r\n\r\n_Igneous rocks_ are those formed by solidification of molten material,\r\neither as lava flows on the earth’s surface (_extrusive igneous rocks_)\r\nor at depth within the earth (_intrusive igneous rocks_). The relative\r\nages of extrusive igneous rocks can often be determined in much the same\r\nway as those of sedimentary strata. A lava flow is younger than the\r\nrocks on which it rests, but older than those that rest on top of it.\r\n\r\nAn intrusive igneous rock must be younger than the rocks that enclosed\r\nit at the time it solidified. It may contain pieces of the enclosing\r\nrocks that broke off the walls and fell into the liquid. Pebbles of the\r\nigneous rock that are incorporated in nearby sedimentary layers indicate\r\nthat the sediments must be somewhat younger.\r\n\r\nAll of these criteria tell us only that one rock is older or younger\r\nthan another. They tell us little about the absolute age of the rocks or\r\nabout how much older one is than the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Fossils and geologic time\r\n\r\nFossils provide important clues to the ages of the rocks in which they\r\nare found. The slow evolution of living things through geologic time can\r\nbe traced by a systematic study of fossils. The fossils are then used to\r\ndetermine the relative ages of the rocks that contain them and to\r\nestablish a geologic time scale that can be applied to fossil-bearing\r\nrocks throughout the world. Figure 18 shows the major subdivisions of\r\nthe last 600 million years of geologic time and some forms of life that\r\ndominated the scene during each of these intervals. Strata containing\r\nclosely related fossils are grouped into _systems_; the time interval\r\nduring which the strata comprising a particular system were deposited is\r\ntermed a _period_. The periods are subdivisions of larger time units\r\ncalled _eras_ and some are split into smaller time units called\r\n_epochs_. Strata deposited during an epoch comprise a _series_. Series\r\nare in turn subdivided into rock units called _groups_ and formations.\r\nExpressed in tabular form these divisions are:\r\n\r\n  Subdivisions of       Time-rock units       Rock units\r\n  geologic time\r\n\r\n  Era\r\n     Period             System\r\n        Epoch              Series\r\n                                              Group\r\n                                                 Formation\r\n\r\nThe time scale based on the study of fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks is\r\ncalled the stratigraphic time scale; it is given in table 1. The\r\nsubdivisions are arranged in the same order in which they were\r\ndeposited, with the oldest at the bottom and the youngest at the top.\r\nAll rocks older than Cambrian (the first period in the Paleozoic Era)\r\nare classed as Precambrian. These rocks are so old that fossils are rare\r\nand therefore cannot be conveniently used as a basis for subdivision.\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphic time scale is extremely useful, but it has serious\r\ndrawbacks. It can be applied only to fossil-bearing strata or to rocks\r\nwhose ages are determined by their relation to those containing fossils.\r\nIt cannot be used directly for rocks that lack fossils, such as igneous\r\nrocks, or metamorphic rocks in which fossils have been destroyed by heat\r\nor pressure. It is used to establish the relative ages of sedimentary\r\nstrata throughout the world, but it gives no information as to how long\r\nago a particular layer was deposited or how many years a given period or\r\nera lasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Radioactive clocks\r\n\r\nThe measurement of geologic time in terms of years was not possible\r\nuntil the discovery of natural radioactivity. It was found that certain\r\natoms of a few elements spontaneously throw off particles from their\r\nnuclei and break down to form atoms of other elements. These decay\r\nprocesses take place at constant rates, unaffected by heat, pressure, or\r\nchemical conditions. If we know the rate at which a particular\r\nradioactive element decays, the length of time that has passed since a\r\nmineral crystal containing the elements formed can be calculated by\r\ncomparing the amount of the radioactive element remaining in the crystal\r\nwith the amount of disintegration products present.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 18. _Major subdivisions of the last 600\r\n    million years of geologic time and some of the dominant forms of\r\n    life._]\r\n\r\n   MILLIONS OF\r\n     YEARS AGO\r\n\r\n             0                                              Man\r\n          0-60  CENOZOIC         QUATERNARY and TERTIARY    Mammals\r\n        60-130  MESOZOIC         CRETACEOUS\r\n       130-180                   JURASSIC                   Dinosaurs\r\n       180-220                   TRIASSIC\r\n       220-260  PALEOZOIC        PERMIAN                    Reptiles\r\n       260-350                   PENNSYLVANIAN,             Amphibians\r\n                                 MISSISSIPPIAN\r\n       350-400                   DEVONIAN                   Fishes\r\n       400-440                   SILURIAN                   Sea scorpions\r\n       440-500                   ORDOVICIAN                 Nautiloids\r\n       500-530                   CAMBRIAN                   Trilobites\r\n          530-  PRECAMBRIAN                                 Soft-bodied\r\n                                                            creatures\r\n\r\nThree principal radioactive clocks now in use are based on the decay of\r\nuranium to lead, rubidium to strontium, and potassium to argon. They are\r\neffective in dating minerals millions or billions of years old. Another\r\nclock, based on the decay of one type of carbon (_Carbon-14_) to\r\nnitrogen, dates organic material, but only if it is less than about\r\n40,000 years old.\r\n\r\nThe uranium, rubidium, and potassium clocks are especially useful in\r\ndating igneous rocks. By determining the absolute ages of igneous rocks\r\nwhose stratigraphic relations to fossil-bearing strata are known, it is\r\npossible to estimate the number of years represented by the various\r\nsubdivisions of the stratigraphic time scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The yardstick of geologic time\r\n\r\nRecent estimates suggest that the earth was formed at least 4.5 billion\r\nyears ago. To visualize the length of geologic time and the relations\r\nbetween the stratigraphic and absolute time scales, let us imagine a\r\nyardstick as representing the length of time from the origin of the\r\nearth to the present (fig. 19). On one side of the yardstick we plot\r\ntime in years; on the other, we plot the divisions of the stratigraphic\r\ntime scale according to the most reliable absolute age determinations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Table 1.

All of the other 31\r\ninches represent Precambrian time. We also see that subdivisions of the\r\nstratigraphic time scale do not represent equal numbers of years. We use\r\nsmaller and smaller subdivisions as we approach the present. (Notice the\r\nsubdivisions of the Tertiary and Quaternary in table 1 that are too\r\nsmall to show even in the enlarged part of figure 19). This is because\r\nthe record of earth history is more vague and incomplete the farther\r\nback in time we go. In effect, we are very nearsighted in our view of\r\ntime. This “geological myopia” becomes increasingly evident throughout\r\nthe remainder of this booklet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 19. _The geologic time scale—our yardstick in\r\n    time._]\r\n\r\n     ABSOLUTE TIME (Years ago)  INCHES  STRATIGRAPHIC TIME SCALE\r\n\r\n                   First man →       0  CENOZOIC\r\n                                     1  MESOZOIC\r\n             First dinosaurs →       2  PALEOZOIC\r\n                                     3\r\n                   500 million       4\r\n      First abundant fossils →       5  PRECAMBRIAN\r\n                                     6\r\n                                     7\r\n                     1 billion       8\r\n                                     9\r\n                                    10\r\n                                    11\r\n                                    12\r\n                                    13\r\n                                    14\r\n        Oldest known fossils →      15\r\n                     2 billion      16\r\n                                    17\r\n                                    18\r\n                                    19\r\n                                    20\r\n                                    21\r\n                                    22\r\n                                    23\r\n                     3 billion      24\r\n                                    25\r\n                                    26\r\n                                    27\r\n          Oldest dated rocks →      28\r\n                                    29\r\n                                    30\r\n                                    31\r\n                     4 billion      32\r\n                                    33\r\n                                    34\r\n                                    35\r\n    Minimum age of the earth →      36\r\n\r\n                         ENLARGEMENT OF THE LAST SIX INCHES\r\n    ABSOLUTE TIME   INCHES   STRATIGRAPHIC TIME SCALE\r\n      (Years Ago)\r\n\r\n                0     0      CENOZOIC          QUATERNARY\r\n                                               TERTIARY\r\n                             MESOZOIC          CRETACEOUS\r\n                      1                        JURASSIC\r\n                                               TRIASSIC\r\n                      2      PALEOZOIC         PERMIAN\r\n                                               PENNSYLVANIAN\r\n                                               MISSISSIPPIAN\r\n                      3                        DEVONIAN\r\n                                               SILURIAN\r\n                                               ORDOVICIAN\r\n      500 million     4      CAMBRIAN\r\n                      5      PRECAMBRIAN\r\n                      6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                PRECAMBRIAN ROCKS—THE CORE OF THE TETONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitor who looks at the high, rugged peaks of the Teton Range is\r\nseeing rocks that record about seven-eighths of all geologic time. These\r\nPrecambrian rocks are part of the very foundation of the continent and\r\nare therefore commonly referred to by geologists as basement rocks. In\r\nattempting to decipher their origin and history we peer backward through\r\nthe dim mists of time, piecing together scattered clues to events that\r\noccurred billions of years ago, perhaps during the very birth of the\r\nNorth American Continent. To cite an oft-quoted example, it is as though\r\nwe were attempting to read the history of an ancient and long-forgotten\r\ncivilization from the scattered unnumbered pages of a torn manuscript,\r\nwritten in a language that we only partially understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Ancient gneisses and schists\r\n\r\nThe oldest Precambrian rocks in the Teton Range are layered gneisses and\r\nschists exposed over wide areas in the northern and southern parts of\r\nthe range and as scattered isolated masses in the younger granite that\r\nforms the high peaks in the central parts. The layered gneisses may be\r\nseen easily along the trails in the lower parts of Indian Paintbrush and\r\nDeath Canyons, and near Static Peak.\r\n\r\nThe _layered gneisses_ are composed principally of quartz, feldspar,\r\n_biotite_ (black mica), and _hornblende_ (a very dark-green or black\r\nmineral commonly forming rodlike crystals). Distinct layers, a few\r\ninches to several feet thick, contain different proportions of these\r\nminerals and account for the banded appearance. Layers composed almost\r\nentirely of quartz and feldspar are light-gray or white, whereas darker\r\ngray layers contain higher proportions of biotite and hornblende.\r\n\r\nSome layers are dark-green to black _amphibolite_, composed principally\r\nof hornblende but with a little feldspar and quartz. In many places the\r\ngneisses include layers of _schist_, a flaky rock, much of which is\r\nmica. At several places on the east slopes of Mount Moran thin layers of\r\nimpure gray marble are found interleaved with the gneisses. West of\r\nStatic Peak along the Alaska Basin Trail a heavy dark rock with large\r\namounts of _magnetite_ (strongly magnetic black iron oxide) occurs as\r\nlayers in the gneiss.\r\n\r\nIn some places the gneiss contains dark-reddish crystals of garnet as\r\nmuch as an inch in diameter. Commonly the garnet crystals are surrounded\r\nby white “halos” which lack biotite or hornblende, probably because the\r\nconstituents necessary to form these minerals were absorbed by the\r\ngarnet crystals. In Death Canyon and on the slopes of Static Peak some\r\nlayers of gray gneiss contain egg-shaped masses of magnetite as much as\r\none-half inch in diameter (fig. 20). These masses are likewise\r\nsurrounded by elliptical white halos and have the startling appearance\r\nof small eyes peering from the rock. Appropriately, this rock has been\r\ncalled the “bright-eyed” gneiss by Prof. Charles C. Bradley in his\r\npublished study (Wyoming Geological Association, 1956) of this area.\r\n\r\nWhat were the ancient rocks from which the gneisses of the Teton Range\r\nwere formed? Most of the evidence has been obliterated but a few\r\nremaining clues enable us to draw some general conclusions. The banded\r\nappearance of many of the gneisses suggests that they were formed from\r\nsedimentary and volcanic rocks that accumulated on the sea floor near a\r\nchain of volcanic islands—perhaps somewhat similar to the modern\r\nAleutians or the islands of Indonesia. When these deposits were buried\r\ndeep in the earth’s crust the chemical composition of some layers may\r\nhave undergone radical changes. Other layers, however, still have\r\ncompositions resembling those of younger rocks elsewhere whose origins\r\nare better known. For example, the layers of impure marble were probably\r\nonce beds of sandy limestone, and the lighter colored gneiss may have\r\nbeen muddy sandstone, possibly containing volcanic ash. Some dark\r\namphibolite layers could represent altered lava flows or beds of\r\nvolcanic ash; others may have resulted from the addition of silica to\r\nmuddy magnesium-rich limestone during metamorphism. The magnetite-rich\r\ngneiss probably was originally a sedimentary iron ore.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 20. _“Bright-eyed” gneiss from Death Canyon.\r\n    The dark magnetite spots are about ¼ inch in diameter. The\r\n    surrounding gneiss is composed of quartz, feldspar, and biotite, but\r\n    biotite is missing in the white halos around the magnetite._]\r\n\r\nMinerals that were most easily altered at depth reacted with one another\r\nto form new minerals more “at home” under the high temperature and\r\npressure in this environment just as the ingredients in a cake react\r\nwhen heated in an oven. Rocks formed by such processes are called\r\n_metamorphic rocks_; careful studies of the minerals that they contain\r\nsuggest that the layered gneisses developed at temperatures as high as\r\n1000°F at depths of 5 to 10 miles. Under these conditions the rocks must\r\nhave behaved somewhat like soft taffy as is shown by layers that have\r\nbeen folded nearly double without being broken (fig. 21). Folds such as\r\nthese range from fractions of an inch to thousands of feet across and\r\nare found in gneisses throughout the Teton Range. In a few places folds\r\nare superimposed in such a way as to indicate that the rocks were\r\ninvolved in several episodes of deformation in response to different\r\nsets of stress during metamorphism.\r\n\r\nWhen did these gneisses form? Age determinations of minerals containing\r\nradioactive elements show that granite which was intruded into them\r\nafter they were metamorphosed and folded is more than 2.5 billion years\r\nold. They must, therefore, be older than that. Thus, they probably are\r\nat least a billion years older than rocks containing the first faint\r\ntraces of life on earth and 2 billion years older than the oldest rocks\r\ncontaining abundant fossils. How much older is not known, but the\r\ngneisses are certainly among the oldest rocks in North America and\r\nrecord some of the earliest events in the building of this continent.\r\n\r\n    Figure 21. _Folds in layered gneisses._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A. _North face of the ridge west of Eagles Rest Peak.\r\n    The face is about 700 feet high. Notice the extreme contortion of\r\n    the gneiss layers._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: B. _Closeup view of some of the folds near the bottom\r\n    of the face in figure A. The light-colored layers are composed\r\n    principally of quartz and feldspar. The darker layers are rich in\r\n    hornblende._]\r\n\r\nIrregular bodies of granite gneiss are interleaved with the layered\r\ngneisses in the northern part of the Teton Range. The _granite gneiss_\r\nis relatively coarse grained, streaky gray or pink, and composed\r\nprincipally of quartz, feldspar, biotite, and hornblende. It differs\r\nfrom enclosing layered gneisses in its coarser texture, lack of\r\nlayering, and more uniform appearance. The dark minerals (biotite and\r\nhornblende) are concentrated in thin discontinuous wisps that give the\r\nrock its streaky appearance.\r\n\r\nThe largest body of granite gneiss is exposed in a belt 1 to 2 miles\r\nwide and 10 miles long extending northeastward from near the head of\r\nMoran Canyon, across the upper part of Moose Basin, and into the lower\r\nreaches of Webb Canyon. This gneiss may have been formed from granite\r\nthat invaded the ancient sedimentary and volcanic rocks before they were\r\nmetamorphosed, or it may have been formed during metamorphism from some\r\nof the sediments and volcanics themselves.\r\n\r\nAt several places in Snowshoe, Waterfalls, and Colter Canyons the\r\nlayered gneisses contain discontinuous masses a few tens or hundreds of\r\nfeet in diameter of heavy dark-green or black _serpentine_. This rock is\r\nfrequently called “_soapstone_” because the surface feels smooth and\r\nsoapy to the touch. Indians carved bowls (fig. 22) from similar material\r\nobtained from the west side of the Tetons and from the Gros Ventre\r\nMountains to the southeast. Pebbles of serpentine along streams draining\r\nthe west side of the Tetons have been cut and polished for jewelry and\r\nsold as “_Teton jade_”; it is much softer and less lustrous than real\r\njade. The serpentine was formed by metamorphism of dark-colored igneous\r\nrocks lacking quartz and feldspar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Granite and pegmatite\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, _granite_ (crystalline igneous rock composed\r\nprincipally of quartz and feldspar) forms only a part of the Teton\r\nRange. The Grand Teton (fig. 6) and most surrounding subsidiary peaks\r\nare sculptured from an irregular mass of granite exposed continuously\r\nalong the backbone of the range from Buck Mountain northward toward\r\nupper Leigh Canyon. The rock is commonly fine grained, white or\r\nlight-gray, and is largely composed of crystals of gray quartz and white\r\nfeldspar about the size and texture of the grains in very coarse lump\r\nsugar. Flakes of black or dark-brown mica (biotite) and silvery white\r\nmica (_muscovite_) about the size of grains of pepper are scattered\r\nthrough the rock.\r\n\r\nFrom the floor of Jackson Hole the granite cliffs and buttresses of the\r\nhigh peaks appear nearly white in contrast to the more somber grays and\r\nbrowns of surrounding gneisses and schists. These dark rocks are laced\r\nby a network of irregular light-colored granite dikes ranging in\r\nthickness from fractions of an inch to tens of feet (fig. 23).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 22. _Indian bowls carved from soapstone,\r\n    probably from the Teton Range. Mouth of the unbroken bowl is about 4\r\n    inches in diameter._]\r\n\r\nThe largest masses of granite contain abundant unoriented angular blocks\r\nand slabs of the older gneisses. These inclusions range from a few\r\ninches in diameter (fig. 24) to slabs hundreds of feet thick and\r\nthousands of feet long.\r\n\r\nDikes or irregular intrusions of pegmatite are found in almost every\r\nexposure of granite. _Pegmatite_ contains the same minerals as granite\r\nbut the individual mineral crystals are several inches or even as much\r\nas a foot in diameter.\r\n\r\nSome pegmatites contain silvery plates or tabular crystals of muscovite\r\nmica as much as 6 inches across that can be split into transparent\r\nsheets with a pocket knife. Others have dark-brown biotite mica in\r\ncrystals about the size and shape of the blade of a table knife.\r\n\r\nA few pegmatites contain scattered red-brown crystals of garnet ranging\r\nin size from that of a BB shot to a small marble; a few in Garnet Canyon\r\nand Glacier Gulch are larger than baseballs (fig. 25). The garnets are\r\nfractured and many are partly altered to _chlorite_ (a dull-green\r\nmicaceous mineral) so they are of no value as gems.\r\n\r\n    Figure 23. _Dikes of granite and pegmatite._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A. _Network of light-colored granite dikes on the\r\n    northeast face of the West Horn on Mt. Moran. The dikes cut through\r\n    gneiss in which the layers slant steeply downward to the left. The\r\n    face is about 700 feet high. Snowfield in the foreground is at the\r\n    edge of the Falling Ice Glacier._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: B. _Irregular dike of granite and pegmatite cutting\r\n    through dark layered gneisses near Wilderness Falls in Waterfalls\r\n    Canyon. The cliff face is about 80 feet high. Contacts of the dike\r\n    are sharp and angular and cut across the layers in the enclosing\r\n    gneiss._]\r\n\r\nPegmatite _dikes_ (tabular bodies of rock that, while still molten, were\r\nforced along fractures in older rocks) commonly cut across granite\r\ndikes, but in many places the reverse is true. Some dikes are composed\r\nof layers of pegmatite alternating with layers of granite (fig. 26),\r\nshowing that the pegmatite and granite are nearly contemporaneous. Prof.\r\nBruno Giletti and his coworkers at Brown University, using the\r\nrubidium-strontium radioactive clock, determined that the granite and\r\npegmatite in the Teton Range are about 2.5 billion years old.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 24. _Angular blocks of old streaky granite\r\n    gneiss in fine-grained granite northwest of Lake Solitude. The\r\n    difference in orientation of the streaks in the gneiss blocks\r\n    indicates that the blocks have been rotated with respect to one\r\n    another and that the fine-grained granite must therefore have been\r\n    liquid at the time of intrusion. A small light-colored dike in the\r\n    upper left-hand block of gneiss ends at the edge of the block; it\r\n    intruded the gneiss before the block was broken off and incorporated\r\n    in the granite. A small dike of pegmatite cuts diagonally through\r\n    the granite just to the left of the hammer and extends into the\r\n    blocks of gneiss at both ends. This dike was intruded after the\r\n    granite had solidified. Thus, in this one small exposure we can\r\n    recognize four ages of rocks: the streaky granite gneiss, the\r\n    light-colored dike, the fine-grained granite, and the small\r\n    pegmatite dike._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Black dikes\r\n\r\nEven the most casual visitor to the Teton Range notices the remarkable\r\nblack band that extends down the east face of Mount Moran (figs. 27 and\r\n28) from the summit and disappears into the trees north of Leigh Lake.\r\nThis is the outcropping edge of a steeply inclined dike composed of\r\n_diabase_, a nearly black igneous rock very similar to basalt. Thinner\r\ndiabase dikes are visible on the east face of Middle Teton, on the south\r\nside of the Grand Teton, and in several other places in the range (see\r\ngeologic map inside back cover).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 25. _Garnet crystal in pegmatite. The crystal\r\n    is about 6 inches in diameter. Other minerals are feldspar (white)\r\n    and clusters of white mica flakes. The mica crystals appear dark in\r\n    the photograph because they are wet._]\r\n\r\nThe diabase is a heavy dark-greenish-gray to black rock that turns rust\r\nbrown on faces that have been exposed to the weather. It is studded with\r\nsmall lath-shaped crystals of feldspar that are greenish gray in the\r\nfresh rock and milk white on weathered surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe black dikes formed from molten rock that welled up into nearly\r\nvertical fissures in the older Precambrian rocks. Toward the edges of\r\nthe dikes the feldspar laths in the diabase become smaller and smaller\r\n(fig. 29), indicating that the wall rocks were relatively cool when the\r\n_magma_ or melted rock was intruded. Rapid chilling at the edges\r\nprevented growth of large crystals. In many places hot solutions from\r\nthe dike permeated the wall rocks, staining them rosy red.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 26. _A small dike of pegmatite and granite\r\n    cutting through folded layered gneiss in Death Canyon.\r\n    Coarse-grained pegmatite forms most of the dike, but fine-grained\r\n    granite is found near the center. Small offshoots of the dike\r\n    penetrate into the wall rocks. The dike cuts straight across folds\r\n    in the enclosing gneisses and must therefore have been intruded\r\n    after development of the folds. The white ruler is about 6 inches\r\n    long._]\r\n\r\nThe black dike on Mount Moran is about 150 feet thick near the summit of\r\nthe peak. This dike has been traced westward for more than 7 miles.\r\nWhere it passes out of the park south of Green Lakes Mountain it is 100\r\nfeet thick. The amount of molten material needed to form the exposed\r\nsegment of this single dike could fill Jenny Lake three times over. The\r\nother dikes are thinner and not as long: the dike on Middle Teton is 20\r\nto 40 feet thick, and the dike on Grand Teton is 40 to 60 feet thick.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 27. _Air oblique view of the east face of Mt.\r\n    Moran, showing the great black dike.

Match shows scale._]\r\n\r\nThe black dikes must be the youngest of the Precambrian units because\r\nthey cut across all other Precambrian rocks. The dikes must have been\r\nintruded before the beginning of Cambrian deposition inasmuch as they do\r\nnot cut the oldest Cambrian beds. Gneiss adjacent to the dike on Mount\r\nMoran contains biotite that was heated and altered about 1.3 billion\r\nyears ago according to Professor Giletti. The alteration is believed to\r\nhave occurred when the dike was emplaced; therefore this and similar\r\ndikes elsewhere in the range are probably about 1.3 billion years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Quartzite\r\n\r\nAt about the same time as the dikes were being intruded in the Tetons,\r\nmany thousands of feet of sedimentary rocks, chiefly sandstone, were\r\ndeposited in western Montana, 200 miles northwest of Grand Teton\r\nNational Park. The sandstone was later recrystallized and recemented and\r\nbecame a very dense hard rock called _quartzite_. Similar quartzite,\r\npossibly part of the same deposit, was laid down west of the north end\r\nof the Teton Range, within the area now called the Snake River downwarp\r\n(fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe visitor who hikes or camps anywhere on the floor of Jackson Hole\r\nbecomes painfully aware of the thousands upon thousands of remarkably\r\nrounded hard quartzite boulders. He wonders where they came from because\r\nnowhere in the adjacent mountains is this rock type exposed. The answer\r\nis that the quartzites were derived from a long-vanished uplift (figs.\r\n42 and 46), carried eastward by powerful rivers past the north end of\r\nthe Teton Range, and then were deposited in a vast sheet of gravel that\r\ncovered much of Jackson Hole 60 to 80 million years ago. Since then,\r\nthese virtually indestructible boulders have been re-worked many times\r\nby streams and ice, yet still retain the characteristics of the original\r\nancient sediments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A backward glance\r\n\r\nSo far we have seen that the Precambrian basement exposed in the Teton\r\nRange contains a complex array of rocks of diverse origins and various\r\nages. Before passing on to the younger rocks, reference to our yardstick\r\nmay help to place the Precambrian events in their proper perspective.\r\n\r\nIn all of Precambrian time, which encompasses more than 85 percent of\r\nthe history of the earth (31 of the 36 inches of our yardstick), only\r\ntwo events are dated in the Teton Range: the intrusion of granite and\r\npegmatite about 2.5 billion years ago, and the emplacement of the black\r\ndikes about 1.3 billion years ago. These dates are indicated by heavy\r\narrows on the time scale (fig. 30). The ancient gneisses and schists\r\nwere formed sometime before 2.5 billion years ago, and probably are no\r\nolder than 3.5 billion years, the age of the oldest rocks dated anywhere\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n           The close of the Precambrian—end of the beginning\r\n\r\nMore than 700 million years elapsed between intrusion of the black dikes\r\nand deposition of the first Paleozic sedimentary rocks—a longer period\r\nof time than has elapsed since the beginning of the Paleozic Era. During\r\nthis enormous interval the Precambrian rocks were uplifted, exposed to\r\nerosion, and gradually worn to a nearly featureless plain, perhaps\r\nsomewhat resembling the vast flat areas in which similar Precambrian\r\nrocks are now exposed in central and eastern Canada. At the close of\r\nPrecambrian time, about 600 million years ago, the plain slowly\r\nfloundered and the site of the future Teton Range disappeared beneath\r\nshallow seas that were to wash across it intermittently for the next 500\r\nmillion years. It is to the sediments deposited in these seas that we\r\nturn to read the next chapter in the geologic story of the Teton Range.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 30. _A glance at the yardstick.

As mentioned previously, the cliffs are the\r\nprojecting edges of layers of sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age that\r\naccumulated in or along the margins of shallow seas. At one time the\r\nlayers formed a thick unbroken, nearly horizontal blanket across the\r\nPrecambrian basement rocks, but subsequent uplift of the eastern edge of\r\nthe Teton fault block tilted them westward. They were then stripped from\r\nthe highest peaks.\r\n\r\nThe Paleozoic and younger sedimentary rocks in the Teton region are\r\nsubdivided into _formations_, each of which is named. A formation is\r\ncomposed of rock layers which, because of their similar physical\r\ncharacteristics, can be distinguished from overlying and underlying\r\nlayers. They must be thick enough to be shown on a geologic map. Table 2\r\nlists the various Paleozoic formations present in and adjacent to Grand\r\nTeton National Park and gives their thicknesses and characteristics.\r\nThese sedimentary rocks are of special interest, for they not only\r\nrecord an important chapter of geologic history but elsewhere in the\r\nregion they contain petroleum and other mineral deposits.\r\n\r\nThe Paleozoic rocks can be viewed close at hand from the top of the\r\nTeton Village tram (fig. 32) on the south boundary of the park. A less\r\naccessible but equally spectacular exposure of Paleozoic rocks is in\r\nAlaska Basin, along the west margin of the park, where they are stacked\r\nlike even layers in a gigantic cake (fig. 33).\r\n\r\n\r\n       Alaska Basin—site of an outstanding rock and fossil record\r\n\r\nStrata in Alaska Basin record with unusual clarity the opening chapters\r\nin the chronicle of seas that flowed and ebbed across the future site of\r\nthe Teton Range during most of the Paleozoic Era. In the various rock\r\nlayers are inscribed stories of the slow advance and retreat of ancient\r\nshorelines, of the storm waves breaking on long-vanished beaches, and of\r\nthe slow and intricate evolution of the myriads of sea creatures that\r\ninhabited these restless waters.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 31. _Paleozoic rocks on the west flank of the\r\n    Teton Range, air oblique view west.

Even more revealing, the fossils themselves are\r\ntangible evidence of the orderly parade of life that crossed the Teton\r\nlandscape during more than 250 million years.

However, the fossils\r\nand regional distribution of the rock units show that this is not really\r\nthe case. The incomplete nature of this record becomes apparent if we\r\nplot the ages of the various formations on the absolute geologic time\r\nscale (fig. 34). The length of time from the beginning of the Cambrian\r\nPeriod to the end of the Mississippian Period is about 285 million\r\nyears. The strata in Alaska Basin are a record of approximately 120\r\nmillion years. More than half of the pages in the geologic story are\r\nmissing even though, compared with most other areas, the book as a whole\r\nis remarkably complete! During these unrecorded intervals of time either\r\nno sediments were deposited in the area of the Teton Range or, if\r\ndeposited, they were removed by erosion.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 32. _Paleozoic marine sedimentary rocks near\r\n    south boundary of Grand Teton National Park.

Early in Cambrian time a shallow seaway, called the\r\n_Cordilleran trough_, extended from southern California northeastward\r\nacross Nevada into Utah and Idaho (fig. 35A). The vast gently rolling\r\nplain on Precambrian rocks to the east was drained by sluggish\r\nwestward-flowing rivers that carried sand and mud into the sea. Slow\r\nsubsidence of the land caused the sea to spread gradually eastward. Sand\r\naccumulated along the beaches just as it does today. As the sea moved\r\nstill farther east, mud was deposited on the now-submerged beach sand.\r\nIn the Teton area, the oldest sand deposit is called the Flathead\r\nSandstone (fig. 36).\r\n\r\nThe mud laid down on top of the Flathead Sandstone as the shoreline\r\nadvanced eastward across the Teton area is now called the Wolsey Shale\r\nMember of the Gros Ventre Formation. Some shale shows patterns of cracks\r\nthat formed when the accumulating mud was briefly exposed to the air\r\nalong tidal flats. Small phosphatic-shelled animals called _brachiopods_\r\ninhabited these lonely tidal flats (fig. 37A and 37B) but as far as is\r\nknown, nothing lived on land. Many shale beds are marked with faint\r\ntrails and borings of wormlike creatures, and a few contain the remains\r\nof tiny very intricately developed creatures with head, eyes, segmented\r\nbody, and tail. These are known as trilobites (fig. 37C and 37D).\r\nDescendants of these lived in various seas that crossed the site of the\r\ndormant Teton Range for the next 250 million years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 33. _View southwest across Alaska Basin,\r\n    showing tilted layers of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks on the west\r\n    flank of the Teton Range.

Following this the sea retreated to the west for a short\r\ntime. In the shallow muddy water resulting from this retreat the Park\r\nShale Member of the Gros Ventre Formation was deposited. In places\r\nunderwater “meadows” of algae flourished on the sea bottom and built\r\nextensive reefs (fig. 38A). From time to time shoal areas were hit by\r\nviolent storm waves that tore loose platy fragments of recently\r\nsolidified limestone and swept them into nearby channels where they were\r\nburied and cemented into thin beds of jumbled fragments (fig. 38B)\r\ncalled _“edgewise” conglomerate_.

The Gallatin, like the Death Canyon\r\nLimestone Member, was laid down for the most part in quiet, clear water,\r\nprobably at depths of 100 to 200 feet. However, a few beds of “edgewise”\r\nconglomerate indicate the occurrence of sporadic storms. At this time,\r\nthe sea covered all of Idaho and Montana and most of Wyoming (fig. 35B)\r\nand extended eastward across the Dakotas to connect with shallow seas\r\nthat covered the eastern United States. Soon after this maximum stage\r\nwas reached slow uplift caused the sea to retreat gradually westward.\r\nThe site of the Teton Range emerged above the waves, where, as far as is\r\nnow known, it may have been exposed to erosion for nearly 70 million\r\nyears (fig. 35C).\r\n\r\nThe above historical summary of geologic events in Cambrian time is\r\nrecorded in the Cambrian formations.

Dilley._]\r\n\r\nThe Bighorn Dolomite of Ordovician age forms ragged hard massive\r\nlight-gray to white cliffs 100 to 200 feet high (figs. 32 and 33).\r\n_Dolomite_ is a calcium-magnesium carbonate, but the original sediment\r\nprobably was a calcium carbonate mud that was altered by magnesium-rich\r\nsea water shortly after deposition. Corals and other marine animals were\r\nabundant in the clear warm seas at this time.\r\n\r\nDolomite in the Darby Formation of Devonian age differs greatly from the\r\nBighorn Dolomite; that in the Darby is dark-brown to almost black, has\r\nan oily smell, and contains layers of black, pink, and yellow mudstone\r\nand thin sandstone. The sea bottom during deposition of these rocks was\r\nfoul and frequently the water was turbid. Abundant fossil fragments\r\nindicate fishes were common for the first time. Exposures of the Darby\r\nFormation are recognizable by their distinctive dull-yellow thin-layered\r\nslopes between the prominent gray massive cliffs of formations below and\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe Madison Limestone of Mississippian age is 1,000 feet thick and is\r\nexposed in spectacular vertical cliffs along canyons in the north, west,\r\nand south parts of the Tetons. It is noted for the abundant remains of\r\nbeautifully preserved marine organisms (fig. 39). The fossils and the\r\nrelatively pure blue-gray limestone in which they are embedded indicate\r\ndeposition in warm tranquil seas. The beautiful Ice Cave on the west\r\nside of the Tetons and all other major caves in the region were\r\ndissolved out of this rock by underground water.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian System is represented by the Amsden Formation and the\r\nTensleep Sandstone. Cliffs of the Tensleep Sandstone can be seen along\r\nthe Gros Ventre River at the east edge of the park. The Amsden, below\r\nthe Tensleep, consists of red and green shale, sandstone, and thin\r\nlimestone. The shale is especially weak and slippery when exposed to\r\nweathering and saturated with water. These are the strata that make up\r\nthe glide plane of the Lower Gros Ventre Slide (fig. 5) east of the\r\npark.\r\n\r\nThe Phosphoria Formation and its equivalents of Permian age are unlike\r\nany other Paleozoic rocks because of their extraordinary content of\r\nuncommon elements. The formation consists of sandy dolomite, widespread\r\nblack phosphate beds and black shale that is unusually rich not only in\r\nphosphorus, but also in vanadium, uranium, chromium, zinc, selenium,\r\nmolybdenum, cobalt, and silver. The formation is mined extensively in\r\nnearby parts of Idaho and in Wyoming for phosphatic fertilizer, for the\r\nchemical element phosphorus, and for some of the metals that can be\r\nderived from the rocks as byproducts. These elements and compounds are\r\nnot everywhere concentrated enough to be of economic interest, but their\r\ndollar value is, in a regional sense, comparable to that of some of the\r\nworld’s greatest mineral deposits.\r\n\r\n    Figure 39. _A glimpse of the sea floor during deposition of the\r\n    Madison Limestone 330 million years ago, showing the remains of\r\n    brachiopods, corals, and other forms of life that inhabited the\r\n    shallow warm water._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A. _Slab in which fossils are somewhat broken and\r\n    scattered.

Moreover, the highly\r\ndiversified forms of life, ranging from marine mollusks to tremendous,\r\nland-living dinosaurs, confirm and reinforce the story of the rocks.\r\nLiving things, too, were in transition, for as environment changed, many\r\nforms moved from the sea to land in order to survive. It was the time\r\nwhen some of the most spectacularly colored rock strata of the region\r\nwere deposited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Colorful first Mesozoic strata\r\n\r\nBright-red soft Triassic rocks more than 1,000 feet thick, known as the\r\nChugwater Formation, comprise most of the basal part of the Mesozoic\r\nsequence (table 4). They form colorful hills east and south of the park.\r\nThe red color is caused by a minor amount of iron oxide. Mud cracks and\r\nthe presence of fossil reptiles and amphibians indicate deposition in a\r\ntidal flat environment, with the sea lying several miles southwest of\r\nJackson Hole. A few beds of white _gypsum_ (calcium sulfate) are\r\npresent; they were apparently deposited during evaporation of shallow\r\nbodies of salt water cut off from the open sea.\r\n\r\nAs the Triassic Period gave way to the Jurassic, salmon-red windblown\r\nsand (Nugget Sandstone) spread across the older red beds and in turn was\r\nburied by thin red shale and thick gypsum deposits of the Gypsum Spring\r\nFormation. Then down from Alaska and spreading across most of Wyoming\r\ncame the _Sundance Sea_, a warm, muddy, shallow body of water that\r\nteemed with marine mollusks. In it more than 500 feet of highly\r\nfossiliferous soft gray shale and thin limestones and sandstones were\r\ndeposited. The sea withdrew and the Morrison and Cloverly Formations\r\n(Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous) were deposited on low-lying tropical\r\nhumid flood plains. These rocks are colorful, consisting of red, pink,\r\npurple, and green badland-forming claystones and mudstones, and yellow\r\nto buff sandstones. Vegetation was abundant and large and small\r\ndinosaurs roamed the countryside or inhabited the swamps.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Table 4.—Mesozoic sedimentary rocks exposed in the\r\n    Teton region.]\r\n\r\n Age Formation        Thickness    Description          Where exposed\r\n                      (feet)\r\n\r\n CRETACEOUS\r\n     Harebell         0-5,000      Sandstone, olive     Eastern and\r\n     Formation                     drab, silty, drab    northeastern parts\r\n                                   siltstone, and       of Jackson Hole.\r\n                                   dark-gray shale;\r\n                                   thick beds of\r\n                                   quartzite pebble\r\n                                   conglomerate in\r\n                                   upper part.\r\n     Meeteetse        0-700        Sandstone, gray to   Spread Creek area.\r\n     Formation                     chalky white,\r\n                                   blue-green to gray\r\n                                   siltstone, thin\r\n                                   coal, and green to\r\n                                   yellow bentonite.\r\n     Mesaverde        0-1,000      Sandstone, white,    Eastern Jackson\r\n     Formation                     massive, soft, thin  Hole.\r\n                                   gray shale, sparse\r\n                                   coal.\r\n     Unnamed          3,500±       Sandstone and        Eastern Jackson\r\n     sequence of                   shale, gray to       Hole and eastern\r\n     lenticular                    brown;

Then, the Teton region, as well as most of Wyoming, was\r\npartly, and at times completely, submerged by shallow muddy seas. As a\r\nresult, the brightly variegated strata were covered by 10,000 feet of\r\ngenerally drab-colored sand, silt, and clay containing some coal beds,\r\nvolcanic ash layers, and minor amounts of gravel.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous sea finally retreated eastward from the Teton region\r\nabout 85 million years ago, following the deposition of the Bacon Ridge\r\nSandstone (fig. 40). As it withdrew, extensive coal swamps developed\r\nalong the sea coast. The record of these swamps is preserved in coal\r\nbeds 5 to 10 feet thick in the Upper Cretaceous deposits. The coal beds\r\nare now visible in abandoned mines along the east margin of the park.\r\nCoal is formed from compacted plant debris; about 5 feet of this\r\nmaterial is needed to form 1 inch of coal. Thus, lush vegetation must\r\nhave flourished for long periods of time, probably in a hot wet climate\r\nsimilar to that now prevailing in the Florida Everglades.\r\n\r\nSporadically throughout Cretaceous time fine-grained ash was blown out\r\nof volcanoes to the west and northwest and deposited in quiet shallow\r\nwater. Subsequently the ash was altered to a type of clay called\r\n_bentonite_ that is used in the foundry industry and in oil well\r\ndrilling muds. In Jackson Hole, the elk and deer lick bentonite\r\nexposures to get a bitter salt and, where the beds are water-saturated,\r\nenjoy “stomping” on them. Bentonite swells when wet and causes many\r\nlandslides along access roads into Jackson Hole (fig. 17).\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous rocks in the Teton region are part of an enormous\r\neast-thinning wedge that here is nearly 2 miles thick. Most of the\r\ndebris was derived from slowly rising mountains to the west.\r\n\r\nCretaceous sedimentary rocks are much more than of just scientific\r\ninterest; they contain mineral deposits important to the economy of\r\nWyoming and of the nation. Wyoming leads the States in production of\r\nbentonite, all of it from Cretaceous rocks. These strata have yielded\r\nfar more oil and gas than any other geologic system in the State and the\r\nproduction is geographically widespread. They also contain enormous coal\r\nreserves, some in beds between 50 and 100 feet thick. The energy\r\nresources alone of the Cretaceous System in Wyoming make it invaluable\r\nto our industrialized society.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 40. _The yardstick and the sea. The shaded\r\n    part of the yardstick shows the 500-million-year interval during\r\n    which Paleozoic and Mesozoic seas swept intermittently across the\r\n    future site of the Tetons. When they finally withdrew about 85\r\n    million years ago, a little more than 5/8 of an inch of the\r\n    yardstick remained to be accounted for._]\r\n\r\n                 ABSOLUTE TIME (Millions of years ago)      INCHES\r\n\r\n  {submerged}                    85-585                      ⅝-4⅝\r\n  CENOZOIC                        0-80                       0-½\r\n  MESOZOIC                       80-180                      ½-⅞\r\n  PALEOZOIC                     180-570                      ⅞-4⅞\r\n  PRECAMBRIAN                     570-                       4⅞-\r\n\r\nAs the end of the Cretaceous Period approached, slightly more than 80\r\nmillion years ago, the flat monotonous landscape (fig. 41) which had\r\nprevailed during most of Late Cretaceous time gave little hint that the\r\nstage was set for one of the most exciting and important chapters in the\r\ngeologic history of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Birth of the Rocky Mountains\r\n\r\nThe episode of mountain building that resulted in formation of the\r\nancestral Rocky Mountains has long been known as the _Laramide\r\nRevolution_. West and southwest of Wyoming, mountains had already\r\nformed, the older ones as far away as Nevada and as far back in time as\r\nJurassic, the younger ones rising progressively farther east, like giant\r\nwaves moving toward a coast. The first crustal movement in the Teton\r\narea began in latest Cretaceous time when a broad low northwest-trending\r\narch developed in the approximate area of the present Teton Range and\r\nGros Ventre Mountains. However, this uplift bore no resemblance to the\r\nTetons as we know them today for the present range formed 70 million\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 41. _Grand Teton National Park region slightly\r\n    more than 80 million years ago, just before onset of Laramide\r\n    Revolution. The last Cretaceous sea still lingered in central\r\n    Wyoming._]\r\n\r\nOne bit of evidence (there are others) of the first Laramide mountain\r\nbuilding west of the Tetons is a tremendous deposit of quartzite boulder\r\ndebris (several hundred cubic miles in volume) derived from the _Targhee\r\nuplift_ (fig. 42). Nowhere is the uplift now exposed, but from the size,\r\ncomposition, and distribution of rock fragments that came from it, we\r\nknow that it was north and west of the northern end of the present-day\r\nTeton Range. Powerful streams carried boulders, sand, and clay eastward\r\nand southeastward across the future site of Jackson Hole and deposited\r\nthem in the Harebell Formation (table 4). Mingled with this sediment\r\nwere tiny flakes of gold and a small amount of mercury. Fine-grained\r\ndebris was carried still farther east and southeast into two enormous\r\ndepositional troughs in central and southern Wyoming. Most of the large\r\nrock fragments were derived from Precambrian and possibly lower\r\nPaleozoic quartzites. This means that at least 15,000 feet of overlying\r\nPaleozoic and Mesozoic strata must first have been stripped away from\r\nthe Targhee uplift before the quartzites were exposed to erosion.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 42. _Teton region at the end of Cretaceous\r\n    time about 65 million years ago. The ancestral Teton-Gros Ventre\r\n    uplift had risen and prominent southeastward drainage from the\r\n    Targhee uplift was well established. See figure 41 for State lines\r\n    and location map._]\r\n\r\nRemains of four-legged horned ceratopsian dinosaurs, possibly\r\n_Triceratops_ (fig. 43), reflecting the last population explosion of\r\nthese reptiles, have been found in pebbly sandstone of the Harebell\r\nFormation in highway cuts on the Togwotee Pass road 8 miles east of the\r\npark.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 43. _Triceratops, a horned dinosaur of the\r\n    type that inhabited Jackson Hole about 65 million years ago. Sketch\r\n    by S. H. Knight._]\r\n\r\nNear the end of Cretaceous time, broad gentle uplifts also began to stir\r\nat the sites of future mountain ranges in many parts of Wyoming. The\r\nancestral Teton-Gros Ventre arch continued to grow. Associated with and\r\nparallel to it was a series of sharp steepsided elongated\r\nnorthwest-trending upfolds (_anticlines_). One of these can be seen\r\nwhere it crosses the highway at the Lava Creek Campground near the\r\neastern margin of Grand Teton National Park.\r\n\r\nDuring these episodes of mountain building, erosion, and deposition, the\r\ndinosaurs became extinct all over the world. The “Age of Mammals” was\r\nabout to begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       TERTIARY—TIME OF MAMMALS, MOUNTAINS, LAKES, AND VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 44. _The last inch of the yardstick, enlarged\r\n    to show subdivisions of the Cenozoic Era._]\r\n\r\n  STRATIGRAPHIC SCALE        THE LAST INCH OF    ABSOLUTE TIME (million\r\n                             THE YARDSTICK       years ago)\r\n\r\n  CENOZOIC\r\n     QUATERNARY\r\n          Recent and         0                   0\r\n          Pleistocene\r\n     TERTIARY\r\n          Pliocene           0                   0\r\n          Miocene            ⅛                   12\r\n          Oligocene          ¼                   25\r\n          Eocene             ⅜                   40\r\n          Paleocene          ⁷/₁₆                55\r\n  MESOZOIC\r\n     CRETACEOUS              ½                   65\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic (table 1), last and shortest of the geologic eras,\r\ncomprises the Tertiary and Quaternary Periods. It began about 65 million\r\nyears ago and is represented by only the final one-half inch of our\r\nimaginary yardstick of time (fig. 19). Nevertheless, it is the era\r\nduring which the Tetons rose in their present form and the landscape was\r\nsculptured into the panorama of beauty that we now see. In order to show\r\nthe many Tertiary and Quaternary events in the Teton region, it is\r\nnecessary to enlarge greatly the last part of the yardstick (fig. 44).\r\nThere are two reasons for the extraordinarily clear and complete record.\r\nFirst, the Teton region was a relatively active part of the earth’s\r\ncrust, characterized by many downdropped blocks. The number of events is\r\ngreat and their records are preserved in sediments trapped in the\r\nsubsiding basins. Second, the geologically recent past is much easier to\r\nsee than the far dimmer, distant past; the rocks that record later\r\nevents are fresher, less altered, more complete, and more easily\r\ninterpreted than are those that tell us of older events.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Table 5.—Cenozoic sedimentary rocks and\r\n    unconsolidated deposits in the Teton region.]\r\n\r\n Age   Formation      Thickness   Description          Where exposed\r\n                      (feet)\r\n\r\n QUATERNARY\r\n    Recent\r\n       Modern         0-200±      Sand, gravel, and    Floor of Jackson\r\n       stream,                    silt along present   Hole and in canyons\r\n       landslide,                 streams; jumbled     and on\r\n       glacial and                broken rock in       mountainsides\r\n       talus deposits             landslides and on    throughout the\r\n                                  talus slopes;        region.\r\n                                  debris around\r\n                                  existing glaciers.\r\n    Pleistocene\r\n       Glacial        0-200±      Gravel, sand, silt,  Floor of Jackson\r\n       deposits and               and glacial debris.

Seas\r\nretreated southward down the Mississippi Valley and never again invaded\r\nthe Teton area. Environments on the recently uplifted land were diverse\r\nand favorable for the development of new forms of plants and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Rise and burial of mountains\r\n\r\nThe enormous section of Tertiary sedimentary rocks in the Jackson Hole\r\narea (table 5) is one of the most impressive in North America. If the\r\nmaximum thicknesses of all formations were added, they would total more\r\nthan 6 miles, but nowhere did this amount of rock accumulate in a single\r\nunbroken sequence. No other region in the United States contains a\r\nthicker or more complete nonmarine Tertiary record; many areas have\r\nlittle or none. The accumulation in Jackson Hole reflects active uplifts\r\nof nearby mountains that supplied abundant rock debris, concurrent\r\nsinking of nearby basins in which the sediments could be preserved, and\r\nproximity to the great Yellowstone-Absaroka volcanic area, one of the\r\nmost active continental volcanic fields in the United States. The volume\r\nand composition of the Tertiary strata are, therefore, clear evidence of\r\ncrustal and subcrustal instability.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 46. _Teton region near end of deposition of\r\n    Paleocene rocks, slightly less than 60 million years ago. The\r\n    ancestral Teton-Gros Ventre uplift formed a partial barrier between\r\n    the Jackson Hole and Green River depositional basins; major\r\n    drainages from the Targhee uplift spread an enormous sheet of gravel\r\n    for 100 miles to the east. See figure 41 for State lines and\r\n    location map._]\r\n\r\nThe many thick layers of conglomerate are evidence of rapid erosion of\r\nnearby highlands. The Pinyon Conglomerate (fig. 45), for example,\r\ncontains zones as much as 2,500 feet thick of remarkably well-rounded\r\npebbles, cobbles, and boulders, chiefly of quartzite identical with that\r\nin the underlying Harebell Formation and derived from the same source,\r\nthe Targhee uplift. Like the Harebell the matrix contains small amounts\r\nof gold and mercury. Rock fragments increase in size northwestward\r\ntoward the source area (fig. 46) and most show percussion scars,\r\nevidence of ferocious pounding that occurred during transport by\r\npowerful, swift rivers and steep gradients.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 47. _Teton region at climax of Laramide\r\n    Revolution, between 50 and 55 million years ago. See figure 41 for\r\n    State lines and location map._]\r\n\r\nConglomerates such as the Pinyon are not the only clue to the time of\r\nmountain building. Another type of evidence—faults—is demonstrated in\r\nfigure 16. The youngest rocks cut by a fault are always older than the\r\nfault. Many faults and the rocks on each side are covered by still\r\nyounger unbroken sediments. These must, therefore, have been deposited\r\nafter fault movement ceased. By dating both the faulted and the\r\noverlying unbroken sediments, the time of fault movement can be\r\nbracketed.\r\n\r\nObservations of this type in western Wyoming indicate that the Laramide\r\nRevolution reached a climax during earliest Eocene time, 50 to 55\r\nmillion years ago. Mountain-producing upwarps formed during this episode\r\nwere commonly bounded on one side by either reverse or thrust faults\r\n(fig. 16B and 16C) and intervening blocks were downfolded into large,\r\nvery deep basins. The amount of movement of the mountain blocks over the\r\nbasins ranged from tens of miles in the Snake River, Salt River,\r\nWyoming, and Hoback Ranges directly south of the Tetons to less than 5\r\nmiles on the east margin of Jackson Hole (the west flank of the Washakie\r\nRange shown in figure 1). The ancestral Teton-Gros Ventre uplift\r\ncontinued to rise but remained one of the less conspicuous mountain\r\nranges in the region (fig. 47).\r\n\r\nThe Buck Mountain fault, the great reverse fault which lies just west of\r\nthe highest Teton peaks (see geologic map and cross section), was formed\r\neither at this time or during a later episode of movement that also\r\ninvolved the southwest margin of the Gros Ventre Mountains. The Buck\r\nMountain fault is of special importance because it raised a segment of\r\nPrecambrian rocks several thousand feet. Later, when the entire range as\r\nwe now know it was uplifted by movement along the Teton fault, the hard\r\nbasement rocks in this previously upfaulted segment continued to stand\r\nmuch higher than those in adjacent parts of the range. All of the major\r\npeaks in the Tetons are carved from this doubly uplifted block.\r\n\r\nThe brightly colored sandstone, mudstone, and claystone in the Indian\r\nMeadows and Wind River Formations (lower Eocene) in the eastern part of\r\nJackson Hole were derived from variegated Triassic, Jurassic, and Lower\r\nCretaceous rocks exposed on the adjacent mountain flanks. Fossils in\r\nthese Eocene Formations show that it took less than 10 million years for\r\nthe uplifts to be deeply eroded and partially buried in their own\r\ndebris.\r\n\r\nThe Laramide Revolution in the area of Grand Teton National Park ended\r\nduring Eocene time between 45 and 50 million years ago, and as the\r\nmountains and basins became stabilized a new element was added.\r\nVolcanoes broke through to the surface in many parts of the\r\nYellowstone-Absaroka area and the constantly increasing volume of their\r\neruptive debris was a major factor in the speed of filling of basins and\r\nburial of mountains throughout Wyoming. This entire process only took\r\nabout 20 million years, and along the east margin of Jackson Hole it was\r\nlargely completed during Oligocene time (fig. 48). However, east and\r\nnortheast of Jackson Lake a Miocene downwarp subsequently formed and in\r\nit accumulated at least 7,000 feet of locally derived sediments of\r\nvolcanic origin.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 48. _Teton region near the close of Oligocene\r\n    deposition, between 25 and 30 million years ago, showing areas of\r\n    major volcanoes and lava flows.

These lake strata consist of\r\nmore than 5,000 feet of white limestone, thin-bedded claystone, and\r\n_tuff_ (solidified ash made up of tiny fragments of volcanic rock and\r\nsplinters of volcanic glass). The claystones contain fossil snails,\r\nclams, beaver bones and teeth, aquatic mice, suckers, and other fossils\r\nthat indicate deposition in a shallow freshwater lake environment. These\r\nbeds underlie Jackson Lake Lodge, the National Elk Refuge, part of\r\nBlacktail Butte, and are conspicuously exposed in white outcrops that\r\nlook like snowbanks on the upper slopes along the east margin of the\r\npark across the valley from the Grand Teton.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 49. _Teton region near close of middle\r\n    Pliocene time, about 5 million years ago, showing areas of major\r\n    volcanoes and lava flows. See figure 41 for State lines and location\r\n    map._]\r\n\r\nTeewinot Lake was formed on a down-faulted block and was dammed behind\r\n(north of) a fault that trends east across the floor of Jackson Hole at\r\nthe south boundary of the park. Lakes are among the most short-lived of\r\nearth features because the forces of nature soon conspire to fill them\r\nup or empty them. This lake existed for perhaps 5 million years during\r\nmiddle Pliocene time; it was shallow, and remained so despite the\r\npouring in of a mile-thick layer of sediment. This indicates that\r\ndowndropping of the lake floor just about kept pace with deposition.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 50. _Restoration of a middle Eocene landscape\r\n    showing some of the more abundant types of mammals.

One such lake, _Grand Valley Lake_ (fig. 49), formed about 25\r\nmiles southwest of Teewinot Lake; both contained sediments with nearly\r\nthe same thickness, composition, appearance, age, and fossils. Although\r\nthese two lakes are on opposite sides of the Snake River Range, the\r\nancestral Snake River apparently flowed through a canyon previously cut\r\nacross the range and provided a direct connection between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Development of mammals\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic Era is known as the “Age of Mammals.” Small mammals had\r\nalready existed, though quite inconspicuously, in Wyoming for about 90\r\nmillion years before Paleocene time. Then about 65 million years ago\r\ntheir proliferation began as a result of the extinction of dinosaurs,\r\nobliteration of seaways that were barriers to distribution, and the\r\ndevelopment of new and varied types of environment. These new\r\nenvironments included savannah plains, low hills and high mountains,\r\nfreshwater lakes and swamps, and extensive river systems. The mammals\r\nincreased in size and, for the first time, became abundant in numbers of\r\nboth species and individuals. The development and widespread\r\ndistribution of grasses and other forage on which many of the animals\r\ndepended were highly significant. Successful adaptation of _herbivores_\r\n(vegetation-eating animals) led, in turn, to increased varieties and\r\nnumbers of predatory _carnivores_ (meat-eating animals).\r\n\r\nDuring early Eocene time, coal swamps formed in eastern Jackson Hole and\r\npersisted for thousands of years, as is shown by 60 feet of coal in a\r\nsingle bed at one locality. Continuing on into middle Eocene time, the\r\nclimate was subtropical and humid, and the terrain was near sea level.\r\nTropical breadfruits, figs, and magnolias flourished along with a more\r\ntemperate flora of redwood, hickory, maple, and oak. Horses the size of\r\na dog and many other small mammals were abundant. Primates, thriving in\r\nan ideal forest habitat, were numerous. Streams contained gar fish and\r\ncrocodiles (fig. 50).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 51. _A typical Oligocene landscape showing\r\n    some of the more abundant types of mammals.

The general land surface rose higher above sea level, perhaps\r\nby accumulation of several thousand feet of Oligocene volcanic rocks\r\n(fig. 52) rather than by continental uplift. _Titanotheres_ (large\r\nfour-legged mammals with the general size and shape of a rhinoceros)\r\nflourished in great numbers for a few million years and then abruptly\r\nvanished. Horses by now were about the size of a very small modern colt.\r\nRabbits, rodents, carnivores, tiny camels, and other mammals were\r\nabundant in Jackson Hole, and the fauna, surprisingly, was essentially\r\nthe same as that 500 miles to the east, at a much lower elevation, on\r\nthe plains of Nebraska and South Dakota (fig. 51).\r\n\r\nThe Miocene Epoch (15 to 25 million years ago) was the time of such\r\nintense volcanic activity in the Teton region that animals must have\r\nfound survival very difficult. A few skeletons and fragmentary parts of\r\ncamels about the size of a small horse and other piglike animals called\r\n_oreodonts_ comprise our only record of mammals; nothing is known of the\r\nplants. Farther east the climate fluctuated from subtropical to warm\r\ntemperate, gradually becoming cooler toward the end of the epoch.\r\n\r\nFossils in the Pliocene lake deposits (8 to 10 million years old; see\r\ndescription of Teewinot Formation) include shallow-water types of\r\nsnails, clams, diatoms, and ostracodes, as well as beavers, mice,\r\nsuckers, and frogs. Pollen in these beds show that adjacent upland areas\r\nsupported fir, spruce, pine, juniper, sage, and other trees and shrubs\r\ncommon to the area today. Therefore, the climate must have been much\r\ncooler than in Miocene time. No large mammals of Pliocene age have been\r\nfound in Jackson Hole. The record of life during Quaternary time is\r\ndiscussed later.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 52. _Layers of volcanic conglomerate separated\r\n    by thin white tuff beds in Wiggins Formation.

These and younger deposits from the same general source filled\r\n    the basins and almost completely buried the mountains in this part\r\n    of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Volcanoes\r\n\r\nVolcanoes are one of the most interesting parts of the geologic story of\r\nthe Teton region. Although ash from distant volcanoes had settled in\r\nnorthwestern Wyoming at least as far back in time as Jurassic, the first\r\nnearby active volcanoes (since the Precambrian) erupted in the\r\nYellowstone-Absaroka region during the early Eocene, about 50 million\r\nyears ago. From then on, the volcanic area grew in size and the violence\r\nof eruptions and volume of debris increased until Pliocene time. This\r\ndebris had a profound influence on the color and composition of the\r\nsediments and on the environment and types of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nThe color of the volcanic rocks and the sediments derived from them\r\nvaries significantly from one epoch to another. For example, the middle\r\nEocene rocks are white to light-green, red, and purple, upper Eocene are\r\ndark-green, Oligocene are light-gray, white, and brown, Miocene are\r\ndark-green, brown, and gray, and Pliocene are white to red-brown.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 53. _Air oblique view south, showing the north\r\n    end of the Teton Range disappearing beneath Pleistocene lava flows.\r\n    Light-colored bare area at lower left is vertical Paleozoic\r\n    limestone surrounded on three sides by nearly horizontal rhyolite\r\n    lava flows.

Moran is rounded summit on middle skyline._]\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, it is probable that the vast outpouring of\r\nvolcanic rocks during late Tertiary time in the Teton region and to the\r\nnorth and northeast is directly related to the subsidence of Jackson\r\nHole and the rise of the Tetons.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular banded cliffs of the Wiggins Formation on both sides of\r\nTogwotee Pass (fig. 52) and farther north in the Absaroka Range are\r\nremnants of Oligocene volcanic conglomerate and tuff that once spread as\r\na blanket several thousand feet thick across eastern Jackson Hole and\r\npartially or completely buried the nearby older folded mountain ranges.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 54. _Obsidian, a volcanic glass less than 10\r\n    million years old, especially prized by Indians who used it for\r\n    spear and arrow points and for tools._]\r\n\r\nAbout 25 million years ago, with the start of the Miocene Epoch,\r\nvolcanic vents opened up within, and along the borders of, Grand Teton\r\nNational Park. Major centers of eruption were at the north end of the\r\nTeton Range, east of Jackson Lake, and south of Spread Creek. They\r\nemitted a prodigious amount of volcanic ash and fragments of congealed\r\nlava. For example, adjacent to one vent a mile in diameter, about 4\r\nmiles north-northeast of Jackson Lake Lodge, is a continuous section,\r\n7,000 feet thick, of waterlaid strata derived in large part from this\r\nvolcanic source. These sedimentary rocks comprise the Colter Formation\r\nwhich is darker colored and contains more iron and magnesium than the\r\nWiggins Formation. The site of deposition at this locality was a\r\nnorth-trending trough that represented an early stage in the downwarping\r\nof Jackson Hole.\r\n\r\nPliocene volcanoes erupted in southern and central Yellowstone Park. The\r\nvolcanoes emitted viscous, frothy, pinkish-gray and brown lava called\r\n_rhyolite_. This is an extrusive igneous rock that has the same\r\ncomposition as granite, but is much finer grained. In several places,\r\nlava apparently flowed into the north end of Teewinot Lake, chilled\r\nsuddenly, and solidified into a black volcanic glass called _obsidian_.\r\nBecause it chips easily into thin flakes having a smooth surface,\r\nobsidian was prized by the Indians, who used it for spear and arrow\r\npoints (fig. 54). Some of this obsidian has a potassium-argon date of 9\r\nmillion years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 55. _East face of Signal Mountain showing\r\n    Bivouac Formation (upper Pliocene or Pleistocene). Tilted ledge is\r\n    rhyolitic welded tuff 2.5 million years old, and slopes above and\r\n    below it are conglomerate. National Park Service photo by W. E.\r\n    Dilley._]\r\n\r\nAfter Teewinot Lake was filled with sediment, the floor of Jackson Hole\r\nbecame a flat boulder-covered surface. Nearby vents erupted heavy fiery\r\nclouds of gaseous molten rock that rolled across this plain and then\r\ncongealed into hard layers with the general appearance of lava flows.\r\nUnder a microscope, however, the rock is seen to be made up of\r\ncompressed fragments of glass that matted down and solidified when the\r\nclouds stopped moving. This kind of rock is called a _welded tuff_. One\r\nof these forms the conspicuous ledge in the Bivouac Formation on the\r\nnorth and east sides of Signal Mountain (fig. 55), and is especially\r\nimportant because it has a potassium-argon date of 2.5 million years.\r\nMore of this _welded tuff_ flowed southward from Yellowstone National\r\nPark, engulfed the north end of the Teton Range (fig. 53), and continued\r\nsouthward along the west side of the mountains for 35 miles and along\r\nthe east side for 25 miles.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 56. _The final 3 million years on our\r\n    yardstick of time, enlarged to show approximate dates of major\r\n    events._]\r\n\r\n  THE LAST HUNDREDTHS      ABSOLUTE TIME  IMPORTANT EVENTS\r\n   OF AN INCH OF THE         (Years ago)\r\n       YARDSTICK\r\n           0                           0  Last glaciation followed by\r\n                                          faulting\r\n         ¹/₁₀₀₀                    50000  Second glaciation\r\n         ²/₁₀₀₀                   100000  ?—First glaciation\r\n         ⁶/₁₀₀₀                   700000  ?—Second Quaternary lake\r\n         ⁸/₁₀₀₀                1 million  ?—Tilting and faulting of\r\n                                          southern part of Jackson Hole\r\n        ¹¹/₁₀₀₀              1.3 million  ?—First Quaternary lake\r\n        ¹²/₁₀₀₀              1.5 million  } Complex series of volcanic\r\n                                          eruptions in southern Jackson\r\n                                          Hole\r\n        ¹⁵/₁₀₀₀              1.9 million  }\r\n        ¹⁶/₁₀₀₀                2 million  ?—Development of Hoback\r\n                                          normal fault\r\n         ²/₁₀₀               2.5 million  Eruption of welded tuff in\r\n                                          Bivouac Formation\r\n        ²⁴/₁₀₀₀                3 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n QUATERNARY—TIME OF ICE, MORE LAKES, AND CONTINUED CRUSTAL DISTURBANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quaternary Period is represented by less than 15-thousandths of the\r\nlast inch on our yardstick of time (fig. 56) and the entire Ice Age\r\ntakes up less than 2-thousandths of an inch (less than the thickness of\r\nthis page). Nevertheless, the spectacular effects of various forces of\r\nnature on the Teton landscape during this short interval of time are of\r\nsuch significance that they warrant a separate discussion. The role of\r\nglaciers in carving the rugged Teton peaks and shaping the adjacent\r\nvalleys was mentioned in the first part of this booklet, but is\r\ndiscussed in more detail here. The magnitude and complexity of crustal\r\nmovements increased during the final 2 million years of time—so much so\r\nthat the beginning of Quaternary time has not yet been identified with\r\nany single event. Figure 56 shows the major events described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Hoback normal fault\r\n\r\nThe _Hoback normal fault_, 30 miles long, with a mile or more\r\ndisplacement, developed in the southernmost part of Jackson Hole about 2\r\nmillion years ago. This fault is on the east side of the valley. Thus,\r\nthe valley block was downdropped between this fault and the Teton fault\r\nthat borders the west side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Volcanic activity\r\n\r\nDuring or shortly after major movement on the Hoback fault, and perhaps\r\nrelated to it, there was a complex series of volcanic eruptions west and\r\nnorth of the town of Jackson, along the south boundary of the park. In\r\nrapid succession, lavas of many types, with a combined thickness of more\r\nthan 1,000 feet, were extruded and volcanic plugs intruded into the\r\nnear-surface sedimentary rocks. These volcanic rocks can be seen on the\r\nEast and West Gros Ventre Buttes.\r\n\r\nThere are no active volcanoes in the Teton region today and no\r\npostglacial lava flows or cinder cones. Five miles north of Grand Teton\r\nNational Park are boiling springs (Flagg Ranch hot springs) that are\r\nassociated with the youngest (late Quaternary) lavas in southern\r\nYellowstone Park. Elsewhere in Jackson Hole are a number of lukewarm\r\nsprings but their relation to volcanic rocks has not been determined.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the vast thicknesses of volcanic debris? We know they\r\nexisted because sections of them have been measured on the eroded edges\r\nof uptilted folds and fault blocks. Many cubic miles of these rocks are\r\nnow buried beneath the floor of Jackson Hole, but a much greater volume\r\nwas carried completely out of the region by water, ice, and wind during\r\nthe final chapter of geologic history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Preglacial lakes\r\n\r\nRemnants of two sets of lake deposits in Jackson Hole record preglacial\r\nevents in Quaternary time. Downdropping of southern Jackson Hole along\r\nthe Hoback and Teton faults blocked the southwestward drainage of the\r\nSnake River, and a new lake formed overlapping and extending south of\r\nthe site of the long-vanished Teewinot Lake. Incorporated in the lake\r\nsediments are fragments of lava like that in nearby Quaternary flows.\r\nFrom this we know that the lake formed after at least some of the lava\r\nwas emplaced. Apparently subsidence was more rapid than filling, for a\r\ntime, at least, because this new lake was deep. Fossil snails preserved\r\nin olive-drab to gray fine-grained claystone overlying lava flows at the\r\nnorth end of East Gros Ventre Butte are the kind now living at depths of\r\n120 to 300 feet in Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada. Near the margins of\r\nthe lake, pink and green claystone and soft sandstone were deposited.\r\nThe duration of this lake is not known but it lasted long enough for 200\r\nfeet of beds to accumulate. Subsequent faulting and warping destroyed\r\nthe lake, left tilted remnants of the beds perched 1,000 feet up on the\r\neast side of Jackson Hole, and permitted the Snake River to reestablish\r\nits course across the mountains to the southwest.\r\n\r\nLater downdropping of Jackson Hole impounded a second preglacial lake.\r\nLittle is known about its extent because nearly everywhere the soft\r\nbrown and gray shale, claystone, and sandstone deposited in it were\r\nscooped out and washed away during subsequent glaciations. A few\r\nremnants of the lake deposits are preserved in protected places,\r\nhowever; two are within the Gros Ventre River Valley—one downstream from\r\nLower Slide Lake about a mile east of the park and the other 4 miles\r\nfarther east. The latter remnant is nearly 500 feet thick and the upper\r\nhalf is largely very fine grained shale and claystone. This fine texture\r\nsuggests that the lake existed for a good many thousand years, for such\r\ndeposits commonly accumulate more slowly than coarser grained debris.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 57. _Map showing extent and direction of\r\n    movement of first and largest ice sheet. See figure 41 for State\r\n    lines and location map._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Ice Age\r\n\r\nWith the uplift of the Teton Range and the formation of Jackson Hole\r\nlate in Cenozoic time the landscape gradually began to assume the\r\ngeneral outlines that we see today. Rain, wind, snow, and frost shaped\r\nthe first crude approximations of the present ridges and peaks. Streams\r\ncut into the rising Teton fault block, eroding the ancestral canyons\r\ndeeper and deeper as the uplift continued. The most recent great chapter\r\nin the story of the Teton landscape, however, remained to be written by\r\nthe glaciers of the _Ice Age_.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the climatic changes that caused the Ice Age are still a\r\nmatter of much scientific debate. Various theories have been advanced\r\nthat attribute them to changes in solar radiation, changes in the\r\nearth’s orbit and inclination to the sun, variations in the amount of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere, shifts in the positions of the\r\ncontinents or the poles, and to many other factors, but none has met\r\nwith universal acceptance. No doubt the explanation lies in some unusual\r\ncombination of circumstances, for widespread glaciation occurred only\r\ntwice before in the earth’s history—once in the late Precambrian and\r\nonce during the Permian. It is quite clear, however, that the glaciers\r\ndid not form in response to any local cause such as the uplift of the\r\nTeton Range, for concurrent climatic changes and ice advance took place\r\nthroughout many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nAt least three times in the last 250,000 years glaciers from the\r\nsurrounding highlands invaded Jackson Hole. The oldest and most\r\nwidespread glaciation probably took place about 200,000 years ago; it\r\nwas called the _Buffalo Glaciation_ by Prof. Eliot Blackwelder in 1915\r\n(see selected references). The age estimate is based on measurements of\r\nthe thickness of the decomposed layer on the surface of obsidian pebbles\r\nin the glacial debris. Major sources of ice were the Beartooth Mountains\r\n(fig. 1), the Absaroka Range, and the Wind River Range. The Gros Ventre\r\nMountains and Teton Range furnished lesser amounts of ice.\r\n\r\nThe ice from the Beartooth and Absaroka centers of ice accumulation\r\nconverged in the northeastern part of Grand Teton National Park and\r\nflowed south along the face of the Teton Range in a giant stream that in\r\nmany places was 2,000 feet thick (fig. 57). All but the highest parts of\r\nthe Pinyon Peak and Mount Leidy Highlands were buried and scoured.\r\nSignal Mountain, Blacktail Butte, and the Gros Ventres Buttes were\r\noverridden and shaped by ice at this time. Another glacier, this one\r\nfrom the Wind River Range, flowed northwest along the Continental\r\nDivide, then down the Gros Ventre River Valley, and merged with the\r\nsouthward-moving main ice stream west of Lower Slide Lake. Where Jackson\r\nHole narrows southward, the glacier became more and more confined, but\r\nnevertheless flowed all the way through the Snake River Canyon and on\r\ninto Idaho.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 58. _Glacial deposits, outwash, and loess\r\n    exposed along Boyle Ditch in Jackson Hole National Elk Refuge.\r\n    Indicated are middle Pliocene Teewinot formation (A), oldest till\r\n    (B), Bull Lake outwash gravel (C), and post-Bull Lake loess (D),\r\n    which here contains snail shells dated by Carbon-14 as 15,000 years\r\n    old. Height of cliff is about 30 feet._]\r\n\r\nThe volume of this great ice mass was probably considerably more than\r\n1,000 cubic miles. When it melted, nearly all the previously accumulated\r\nsoil in Jackson Hole was washed away and a pavement of quartzite\r\nboulders mantled much of the glaciated surface. In areas not\r\nsubsequently glaciated, the lack of soil and abundance of quartzite\r\nboulders drastically influenced the topography, later drainage,\r\ndistribution of all types of vegetation, especially conifers and grass,\r\nand the pattern of human settlement and industry.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 59. _View west from the Snake River overlook\r\n    showing at upper right the Burned Ridge moraine (with trees) merging\r\n    southward with the highest (oldest) Pinedale outwash plain.

At the bottom is\r\n    Deadman’s Bar, a gravel deposit at the present river level. Photo by\r\n    H. D. Pownall._]\r\n\r\nThe second glaciation, named _Bull Lake_, was less than half as\r\nextensive as the first. A large tongue of ice from the Absaroka center\r\nof accumulation flowed down the Buffalo River Valley and joined ice from\r\nthe Tetons on the floor of Jackson Hole. An enormous outwash fan of\r\nquartzite boulders extended from near Blacktail Butte southward\r\nthroughout most of southern Jackson Hole. Glaciers in the Gros Ventre\r\nMountains did not advance beyond the east margin of the valley floor.\r\nCarbon-14 ages and data from weathered obsidian pebbles suggest that\r\nthis glaciation took place between 35,000 and 80,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nBull Lake moraines and outwash deposits are overlain directly in the\r\nsouthern part of Jackson Hole by fine silt, rather than by deposits of\r\nthe third glaciation (fig. 58). This silt, of windblown origin, is\r\ncalled _loess_ and contains fossil shells dated by Carbon-14 as between\r\n13,000 and 19,000 years old. Wherever the loess occurs, it is marked by\r\nabundant modern coyote dens and badger burrows.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 60. _Air oblique view west toward the Teton\r\n    Range, showing effects of Pinedale Glaciation on the landscape.

Casebeer._]\r\n\r\nThe third and last glaciation, named the _Pinedale_, was even less\r\nextensive than the others. Nevertheless it was of great importance for\r\nit added the final touches to the present landscape. The jagged\r\nintricately ice-carved peaks (fig. 4) and the glittering lakes and broad\r\ngravelly plains are vivid reminders of this recent chapter in geologic\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nPinedale glaciers advanced down Cascade, Garnet, Avalanche, and Death\r\nCanyons and spilled out onto the floor of Jackson Hole, where they built\r\nthe outermost loops of the conspicuous terminal moraines that now\r\nencircle Jenny, Bradley, Taggart, and Phelps Lakes (fig. 13). Ice\r\nstreams from Glacier Gulch and Open Canyon also left prominent moraines\r\non the valley floor, but these do not contain lakes. Ice from Leigh\r\nCanyon and all of the eastward-draining valleys to the north combined to\r\nform a large glacier in roughly the present position of Jackson Lake.\r\nThis ice entirely surrounded Signal Mountain, leaving only the upper few\r\nhundred feet projecting as an island or _nunatak_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 61. _The Pinedale Glaciers in the central part\r\n    of Jackson Hole as they might have appeared at the time the Jackson\r\n    Lake moraine was built.

Coarser dots near the margins of the glaciers represent\r\n    concentrations of rock debris in the ice._]\r\n\r\nThe southernmost major advance of Pinedale ice from Jackson Lake is\r\nmarked by a series of densely timbered moraines that cross the Snake\r\nRiver Valley. This series is collectively named the _Burned Ridge\r\nmoraine_ (fig. 61). Extending southward for 10 miles from this moraine\r\nis a remarkably flat surfaced gravelly outwash deposit. It was spread by\r\nstreams that poured from the glacier at the time the moraine was being\r\nbuilt (fig. 59). East of the Snake River, the main highway from a point\r\njust north of Blacktail Butte to the Snake River overlook is built on\r\nthis flat untimbered surface. We assume that the outwash is younger than\r\n15,000 years because it apparently overlies loess of that age.\r\n\r\nThe glacier withdrew rapidly northward from the Burned Ridge moraine,\r\nleaving behind many large irregular masses of stagnant, debris-covered\r\nice. The sites of these became kettles, locally known as “The Potholes”\r\n(fig. 12). The main glacier retreated to a position marked by the loop\r\nof moraines just south of Jackson Lake (fig. 60). Figure 61 is a sketch\r\nmap showing how the glaciers in this part of Jackson Hole might have\r\nappeared at the time the Jackson Lake moraine was built.\r\n\r\nAbundant snail shells have been found in lake sediments in the bottoms\r\nof the kettles north of the Burned Ridge moraine (fig. 60) as well as on\r\nlow ridges between them. Carbon-14 age determinations indicate that the\r\nsnails lived about 9,000 years ago, either in a lake already present\r\nbefore the Pinedale ice advanced and formed the Burned Ridge moraine or\r\nin ponds that filled kettles left as the ice melted behind this moraine.\r\n\r\nIn either case, the shells indicate that the Pinedale glaciers probably\r\nexisted on the floor of Jackson Hole as recently as 9,000 years ago, at\r\na time when Indians were already living in the area. We can easily\r\nimagine the fascination with which these primitive peoples may have\r\nwatched as year after year the glaciers wasted away, slowly retreating\r\nback into the canyons, then withdrawing into the sheltered recesses of\r\nthe high mountains, eventually to dwindle and disappear.\r\n\r\nMany bits of evidence, both from North America and Europe, indicate that\r\nthere was a period called the _climatic optimum_ about 6,000 years ago\r\nwhen the climate was significantly warmer and drier than at present. We\r\nsuspect, though there is as yet no direct proof, that the Pinedale\r\nglaciers wasted away entirely during this interval.\r\n\r\nThe modern pattern of vegetation in Jackson Hole is strongly influenced\r\nby the distribution of Pinedale glacial moraines and outwash deposits.\r\nAlmost without exception the moraines are heavily forested, whereas the\r\nnearby outwash deposits are covered only by a sparse growth of\r\nsagebrush. This is probably because the moraines contain large amounts\r\nof clay and silt produced by the grinding action of the glaciers.\r\nMaterial of this type retains water much better and, because of the\r\ngreater variety of chemical elements, is more fertile than the porous\r\nquartzite gravel and sand on the outwash plains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Modern glaciers\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen small rapidly dwindling glaciers exist today in shaded\r\nreentrants high in the Teton Range. They are probably vestiges of ice\r\nmasses built up since the climatic optimum, during the so-called\r\n“_Little Ice Age_.” These glaciers, while insignificant compared to\r\nthose still present in many other mountain ranges, are fascinating\r\nworking models of the great ice streams that shaped the Tetons during\r\nPleistocene time.\r\n\r\nThe Teton Glacier (fig. 6) is one of the best known. It is an ice body\r\nabout 3,500 feet long and 1,100 feet wide that lies at the head of\r\nGlacier Gulch, shaded by the encircling ridges of the Grand Teton, Mount\r\nOwen, and Mount Teewinot. Ice in the central part is moving at a rate of\r\nmore than 30 feet a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geologic story of the Teton country from the time the earth was new\r\nto the present day has been summarized. What can we learn from it? We\r\nbecome aware that events recorded in the rocks are not a chaotic jumble\r\nof random accidents but came in an orderly, logical succession. We see\r\nthe majestic parade of life evolving from simple to complex types,\r\novercoming all natural disasters, and adapting to ever-changing\r\nenvironments. We can only speculate as to the motivating force that\r\nlaunched this fascinating geologic and biologic venture and what the\r\nultimate goal may be. New facts and new ideas are added to the story\r\neach year, but many unknown chapters remain to be studied; these offer\r\nan irresistible, continuing challenge to inquisitive minds, strong\r\nbodies, and restless, adventurous spirits.\r\n\r\nMost geologic processes that developed the Teton landscape have been\r\nbeneficial to man; a few have interfered with his activities, cost him\r\nmoney, time, effort, and on occasion, his life. Postglacial faulting and\r\ntilting along the southern margin of Grand Teton National Park diverted\r\ndrainage systems (such as Flat Creek, southwest of the Flat Creek fault\r\non the south edge of the geologic map), raised hills, dropped valleys,\r\nand made steep slopes unstable. Flood-control engineers wage a\r\nnever-ending struggle to keep the Snake River from shifting to the west\r\nside of Jackson Hole as the valley tilts westward in response to\r\nmovement along the Teton fault. Each highway into Jackson Hole has been\r\nblocked by a landslide at one time or another and maintenance of roads\r\nacross slide areas requires much ingenuity. We see one slide (the Gros\r\nVentre) that blocked a river; larger slides have occurred in the past,\r\nand more can be expected. Abundant fresh fault scarps are a constant\r\nreminder that public buildings, campgrounds, dams, and roads need to be\r\ndesigned to withstand the effects of earthquakes. Some of these problems\r\nhave geologic solutions; others can be avoided or minimized as further\r\nstudy increases our understanding of this region.\r\n\r\nMan appeared during the last one-fiftieth of an inch on our yardstick of\r\ntime gone by. In this short span he has had more impact on the earth and\r\nits inhabitants than any other form of life. Will he use wisely the\r\nlessons of the past as a guide while he writes his record on the\r\nyardstick of the future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis booklet could not have been prepared without the cooperation and\r\nassistance of many individuals and organizations.

Good, former chief park\r\nnaturalist of Yellowstone National Park; Bryan Harry, former assistant\r\nchief park naturalist of Grand Teton National Park; and Richard Klinck,\r\n“1965 National Teacher of the Year.”\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Ann C. Christiansen, Geologic Map Editor, for advice\r\nand guidance on the illustrations and to R. C. Fuhrmann and his staff\r\nfor preparation of many of the line drawings. Block diagrams and photo\r\nartwork were prepared by J. R. Stacy and R. A. Reilly. All photographs\r\nwithout specific credit lines are by the authors. From the beginning of\r\nthe Teton field study to editing and proofing of the final manuscript,\r\nour wives, Jane M. Love and Linda H. Reed, have been enthusiastic and\r\nindispensable participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Selected references—if you wish to read further\r\n\r\n\r\n  Blackwelder, Eliot, 1915, Post-Cretaceous history of the mountains of\r\n          central western Wyoming: Jour.

Love, a native of Wyoming, received his bachelor and master of\r\narts degrees from the University of Wyoming and his doctor of philosophy\r\ndegree from Yale University. His first field season in the Teton\r\ncountry, in 1933, was financed by the Geological Survey of Wyoming.\r\nAfter 12 years of geologic work ranging from New England to Utah and\r\nMichigan to Mississippi, he returned to the Teton region. Beginning in\r\n1945, he spent parts or all of 20 field seasons in and near the Tetons.\r\nHe compiled the first geologic map of Teton County. He is the senior\r\nauthor of the geologic map of Wyoming, and author or co-author of more\r\nthan 70 other published maps and papers on the geology of Wyoming. In\r\n1961, the University of Wyoming awarded him an honorary doctor of laws\r\ndegree for his work on uranium deposits that “led to the development of\r\nthe uranium industry in Wyoming.” The Wyoming Geological Association\r\nmade him an honorary life member and gave him a special award for his\r\ngeologic studies of the Teton area. He is a Fellow of the Geological\r\nSociety of America and is active in various other geological\r\norganizations, as well as having been president of the Wyoming Chapters\r\nof Sigma Xi (scientific honorary) and Phi Beta Kappa (scholastic\r\nhonorary) societies.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Reed, Jr., joined the U.S. Geological Survey in 1953 after\r\nreceiving his doctor of philosophy degree from the John Hopkins\r\nUniversity. His principal geologic work before coming to the Teton\r\nregion was in Alaska and in the southern Appalachians. Beginning in\r\n1961, he spent five field seasons studying and mapping the Precambrian\r\nrocks in Grand Teton National Park, including all the high peaks in the\r\nTeton Range. He is a noted mountaineer, a Fellow of the Geological\r\nSociety of America, a member of the Arctic Institute of North America,\r\nand the American Alpine Club. His numerous publications, in addition to\r\nthose on the Tetons, describe the geology of mountainous areas in\r\nAlaska, the Appalachians, and Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Index of
