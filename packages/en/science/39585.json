DORAN COMPANY\r\n\r\n1919\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,\r\nnor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet\r\nriches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time\r\nand chance happeneth to them all.\r\n\r\n\"For man also knoweth not his time; as the fishes that are taken in an\r\nevil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons\r\nof men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nBy H.G. WELLS\r\n\r\nYour egoist, like the solitary beasts, lives only for himself; your\r\naltruist declares that he lives only for others; for either there may be\r\nsuccess or failure but for neither can there be tragedy. For even if the\r\naltruist meets nothing but ingratitude, what has he to complain of? His\r\npremises abolish his grounds of complaint. But both egoist and altruist\r\nare philosophical abstractions. The human being by nature and necessity\r\nis neither egoist nor altruist; he trims a difficult course between the\r\ntwo; for the most part we are, within the limits of our powers of\r\nexpression, _egotists_, and our desire is to think and if possible talk\r\nand write about this marvellous experiment of ourselves, with all the\r\nworld--or as much as we can conveniently assemble--for audience. There\r\nis variety in our styles. Some drape the central figure; some let it\r\nrather appear than call attention to it; some affect a needless\r\nfrankness: \"_I_ am an egotist, mind you, and I pretend nothing else\";\r\nsome by adopting a pose with accessories do at least develop so great\r\nand passionate an interest in the accessories as to generalise and\r\nescape more or less completely from self. An egotism like an eggshell is\r\na thing from which to escape; the art of life is that escape. The\r\nfundamental art of life is to recover the sense of that great\r\nself-forgetful continuous life from which we have individually budded\r\noff. Many people have done this through religion, which begins with a\r\ntremendous clamour to some saviour god or other to recognise us and ends\r\nin our recognition of him; or through science, when your egotist begins\r\nwith: \"Behold me! I, I your humble servant, am a scientific man, devoted\r\nto the clear statement of truth,\" and ends with so passionate a\r\nstatement of truth that self is forgotten altogether.\r\n\r\nIn this diary of an intensely egotistical young naturalist, tragically\r\ncaught by the creeping approach of death, we have one of the most moving\r\nrecords of the youthful aspects of our universal struggle. We begin with\r\none of those bright schoolboys that most of us like to fancy we once\r\nwere, that many of us have come to love as sons or nephews or younger\r\nbrothers, and this youngster is attracted by natural science, by the\r\nemployments of the naturalist and by the thought of being himself some\r\nday a naturalist. From the very beginning we find in this diary the\r\nthree qualities, from the narrowest to broadest. \"Observe me,\" he says\r\nto himself, \"I am observing nature.\" There is the self-conscious,\r\nself-centred boy. But he also says \"I am observing nature!\" And at\r\nmoments comes the clear light. He forgets himself in the twilight cave\r\nwith the bats or watching the starlings in the evening sky, he becomes\r\njust you and I and the mind of mankind gathering knowledge. And the\r\ndiary, as the keen edge of untimely fate cuts down into the sensitive\r\ntissue, shows us presently, after outcries and sorrow and darkness of\r\nspirit, the habits of the observer rising to the occasion. Not for him,\r\nhe realises, are the long life, the honours of science, the Croonian\r\nlecture, the listening Royal Society, one's memory embalmed in specific\r\nor generic names, the sure place in the temple of fame, that once filled\r\nhis boyish dreams. But here is something close at hand to go on\r\nobserving manfully to the end, in which self may be forgotten, and that\r\nis his own tormented self, with desire still great and power and hope\r\nreceding. \"I will go on with this diary,\" I read between the lines. \"You\r\nshall have at least one specimen, carefully displayed and labelled. Here\r\nis a recorded unhappiness. When you talk about life and the rewards of\r\nlife and the justice of life and its penalties, what you say must square\r\nwith this.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is what we have here. It will be going beyond the necessities of\r\nthis preface to expatiate upon a certain thread of unpremeditated and\r\nexquisite beauty that runs through the story this diary tells. To all\r\nsensitive readers it will be plain enough, and those who cannot see it\r\nplain do not deserve to have it underlined for them, that, still\r\nunseeing, they may pretend to see. Nor need we dilate upon the\r\ndevelopment of the quality of this diary from the rather fussy egotism\r\nof the earlier half. But it may be well to add a few explanatory facts\r\nthat the opening chapters rather take for granted. Barbellion began life\r\nat a material as well as a physical disadvantage; neither of his parents\r\nwere sturdy people, his mother died at last of constitutional heart\r\nweakness, and his father belonged to that most unfortunate class, the\r\npoor educated, who live lives of worry in straitened circumstances.\r\nBarbellion's father was a newspaper reporter in a west country town, his\r\nincome rarely exceeded a couple of hundred pounds a year; the\r\neducational facilities of the place were poor, and young Barbellion had\r\nto get such learning as he could as a day boy at a small private school,\r\nhis father supplementing this meagre training and presently taking him\r\non as an apprentice reporter. How the passion for natural science arose\r\ndoes not appear in this diary; we already find the naturalist formed in\r\nthe first schoolboy entries. An uncle, a chemist, seems to have\r\nencouraged the tendency, and to have given him textbooks and other help.\r\nSomehow at any rate he acquired a considerable amount of knowledge; by\r\nthe time he was eighteen he was already publishing quite excellent\r\nobservations of his own in such periodicals as the _Zoologist_, and by\r\nthe time he was twenty he could secure an appointment as assistant\r\nnaturalist to the director of a well-known marine biological station. It\r\nwas a success, as the reader will learn, gained only to be renounced.\r\nHis father was ill and he had to stand by his family; our economical\r\ncountry cannot afford to make biologists out of men who can earn a\r\nliving as hack reporters. Poverty and science are sisters wherever the\r\nflag of Britain waves; for how could the rich live if we wasted money on\r\nthat sort of thing? But the dream was not altogether abandoned, and in\r\n1911 Barbellion got a post, one of the dozen or so of rare and coveted\r\nopportunities to toil in a scientific atmosphere that our Empire\r\naffords; he secured an assistantship at the Natural History Museum,\r\nSouth Kensington, to which a living wage was attached, a fair equivalent\r\nto a reporter's earnings. The rest of the story needs no helping out.\r\nLet me only add that since 1911 Barbellion, in spite of his steadily\r\ndiminishing strength, has published articles in both British and\r\nAmerican periodicals, that entirely justify the statement that in him\r\nbiological science loses one of the most promising of its recent\r\nrecruits. His scientific work is not only full and exact but it has\r\nthose literary qualities, the grace, the power of handling, the breadth\r\nof reference, which have always distinguished the best English\r\nbiological work, and which mark off at once the true scientific man from\r\nthe mere collector and recorder of items. With this much introduction\r\nBarbellion may be left to tell the tragedy of his hopes and of the dark,\r\nunforeseen, unforeseeable, and inexplicable fate that has overtaken\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I--THE JOURNAL BEGINS WHEN ITS AUTHOR IS A LITTLE OVER 13 YEARS\r\nOLD.\r\n\r\n_[The Following are Selected Entries.]_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 3.\r\n\r\nAm writing an essay on the life-history of insects and have abandoned\r\nthe idea of writing on \"How Cats Spend their Time.\"\r\n\r\n_January_ 17.\r\n\r\nWent with L---- out catapult shooting. While walking down the main road\r\nsaw a Goldfinch, but very indistinctly--it might not have been one. Had\r\nsome wonderful shots at a tree creeper in the hedge about a foot away\r\nfrom me. While near a stream, L---- spotted what he thought to be some\r\nWild Duck and brought one down, hitting it right in the head. He is a\r\nsplendid shot. We discovered on examining it that it was _not_ Wild Duck\r\nat all but an ordinary tame Wild Duck--a hen. We ran away, and to-night\r\nL---- tells me he saw the Farmer enter the poulterer's shop with the\r\nbird in his hand.\r\n\r\n_January_ 19.\r\n\r\nWent to A---- Wood with S---- and L----. Saw a Barn Owl (_Strix\r\nflammea_) flying in broad daylight. At A---- Woods, be it known, there\r\nis a steep cliff where we were all out climbing to inspect and find all\r\nthe likely places for birds to build in, next spring. S---- and I got along\r\nall right, but L----, being a bit too careless, let go his hold on a\r\ntree and fell headlong down. He turned over and over and seemed to us to\r\npitch on the back of his neck. However, he got up as cheerfully as ever,\r\nsaying, \"I don't like that--a bit of a nasty knock.\"\r\n\r\n_February_ 8.\r\n\r\nJoe became the mother of one kitten to-day. It was born at 1.20. It is\r\na tiny little thing. One would almost call it deformed. It is gray.\r\n\r\n_March_ 18.\r\n\r\nOur Goldfinch roosts at 5.30. Joe's kitten is a very small one. \"Magpie\"\r\nis its name.\r\n\r\n_March_ 28.\r\n\r\nWent our usual ramble. But we were unfortunate from the very beginning.\r\nFirst, when we reached the \"Nightjar Field,\" we found there were two men\r\nat the bottom of it cutting the hedge, so we decided not to venture on,\r\nas Gimbo and Bounce were with us, and it would look like poaching. Later\r\non, we came to a splendid wood, but had to withdraw hastily from it, an\r\nold farmer giving us a severe chase. There were innumerable rabbits in\r\nthe wood, so, of course, the dogs barked hard. I gave them a sound\r\nbeating when we got back out of danger, The old farmer is known as \"Bale\r\nthe Bell-hanger.\"\r\n\r\n_April_ 2.\r\n\r\nI was glad yesterday to see the egg season so well in. I shall have to\r\nget blow-pipes and egg drills. Spring has really arrived and even the\r\ngrasshoppers are beginning to stridulate, yet Burke describes these\r\nlittle creatures as being \"loud and troublesome\" and the chirp\r\nunpleasant. Like Samuel Johnson, he must have preferred brick walls to\r\ngreen hedges. Many people go for a walk and yet are unable to admire\r\nNature simply because their power of observation is untrained. Of course\r\nsome are not suited to the study at all and do not trouble themselves\r\nabout it. In that case they should not talk of what they do not\r\nunderstand.... I might have noticed that I have used the term \"Study of\r\nNature.\" But it cannot be called a _study_. It _is_ a pastime of sheer\r\ndelight, with naught but beautiful dreams and lovely thoughts, where we\r\nare urged forward by the fact that we are in God's world which He made\r\nfor us to be our comfort in time of trouble.... Language cannot express\r\nthe joy and happy forgetfulness during a ramble in the country. I do\r\nnot mean that all the ins and outs and exact knowledge of a naturalist\r\nare necessary to produce such delight, but merely the common\r\nobjects--Sun, Thrush, Grasshopper, Primrose, and Dew.\r\n\r\n_April_ 21.\r\n\r\nS---- and I have made a little hut in the woods out of a large natural\r\nhole in the ground by a big tree. We have pulled down branches all\r\naround it and stuck in upright sticks as a paling. We are training ivy\r\nto grow over the sticks. We smoke \"Pioneer\" cigarettes here and hide the\r\npackets in a hole under the roots of the tree. It's like a sort of\r\ncupboard.\r\n\r\n_August_ 6.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, S---- and I cycled to S----, and when it was dark we\r\nwent down on the rocks and lit a fire which crackled and burnt in the\r\ndusk of the evening.... Intend to do a bit to Beetles these hols. Rev.\r\nJ. Wood in the _B.O.P_. has incited me to take them up, and it is really\r\ntime, for at present I am as ignorant as I can hang together of the\r\nColeoptera.\r\n\r\n_December_ 24.\r\n\r\nWent out with L---- to try to see the squirrels again. We could not find\r\none and were just wondering if we should draw blank when L---- noticed\r\none clinging to the bark of a tree with a nut in its mouth. We gave it a\r\ngood chase, but it escaped into the thickest part of the fir tree, still\r\ncarrying the nut, and we gave up firing at it. Later on, L---- got\r\nfoolishly mischievous--owing, I suppose, to our lack of sport--and\r\nunhinged a gate which he carried two yards into a copse, and threw it on\r\nthe ground. Just then, he saw the Squirrel again and jumped over the\r\nhedge into the copse, chasing it from tree to tree with his catty.\r\nHaving lost it, he climbed a fir tree into a Squirrel's drey at the top\r\nand sat there on the tree top, and I, below, was just going to lift the\r\ngate back when I looked up and saw a farmer watching me, menacing and\r\nsilent. I promptly dropped the gate and fled. L---- from his Squirrel's\r\ndrey, not knowing what had happened, called out to me about the\r\nnest--that there was nothing in it. The man looked up and asked him who\r\nhe was and who I was. L---- would not say and would not come down. The\r\nfarmer said he would come up. L---- answered that if he did he would\r\n\"gob\" [_i.e_. spit] on him. Eventually L---- climbed down and asked the\r\nfarmer for a glass of cider. The latter gave him his boot and L---- ran\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1904\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 23.\r\n\r\nWent to the meet of the Stag hounds. Saw a hind in the stream at\r\nL----with not a horse, hound, or man in sight. It looked quite\r\nunconcerned and did not seem to have been hunted. I tried to head it,\r\nbut a confounded sheep-dog got there before me and drove it off in the\r\nwrong direction. I _was_ mad, because if I had succeeded in heading it\r\nand had there been a kill, I should have got a slot. Got home at 6.30,\r\nafter running and walking fifteen miles--tired out.\r\n\r\n_April_ 5.\r\n\r\nJust read _Stalky & Co_. Of Stalky, Beetle, and McTurk, I like Beetle\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n_April_ 14.\r\n\r\nWon the School Gymnasium championship (under fifteen).\r\n\r\n_August_ 25.\r\n\r\nHad quite an adventure to-day. D---- and I cycled to the Lighthouse at\r\n----. On the way, in crossing the sands near the Hospital Ship we espied\r\na lame Curlew which could hardly fly. I gave chase, but it managed to\r\nscramble over a gut full of water about two yards wide. D---- took off\r\nhis boots and stockings and carried me over on his back, and we both\r\nraced across the sands to where the Curlew lay in an exhausted state. I\r\npicked him up and carried him off under my arm, like the boy with the\r\nGoose that laid the golden eggs. All the time, the bird screamed loudly,\r\nopening its enormously long bill and struggling to escape. Arrived at\r\nthe gut again, we found that the incoming tide had made the gut wider\r\nand deeper so that we were cut off from the mainland, and found it\r\nnecessary to wade across at once before it got deeper. As I had to carry\r\na pair of field-glasses as well as my boots and stockings, I handed over\r\nthe struggling bird to D----. While wading across, I suddenly sank to my\r\nwaist in a sandpit. This frightened me, and I was glad to reach the\r\nother side in safety. But on arrival I found D----, but no Curlew. In\r\nwading across the current, he grew flurried and let it go. The tide\r\nswept it upstream, and the poor bird, I fear, perished by drowning....\r\nKnocked up my friend P----, who is skipper of the ship _N_---- and asked\r\nhim if he had a fire so that I could dry myself. He replied that they\r\nhad no fire but that his \"missus\" would look out a pair of pants for me.\r\nBefore falling in with this plan unconditionally, I thought it best to\r\ninspect the garment. However, it was quite clean--a pair of blue serge\r\nseaman's trousers, very baggy in the seat and far too long. But I turned\r\nup the bottoms and hid the baggy part underneath my overcoat. So, I got\r\nback home!\r\n\r\n_September_ 8.\r\n\r\nWet all day. Toothache.\r\n\r\n_September_ 9.\r\n\r\nToothache.\r\n\r\n_September_ 10.\r\n\r\nToothache.\r\n\r\n_September_ 11.\r\n\r\nToothache.\r\n\r\n_Xmas Day._\r\n\r\nMother and Dad wanted to give me one of G.A. Henty's, but, fearing lest\r\nI did not want it, they did not put my name in it, so that if I wished I\r\ncould change it. Intend doing this. Am reading the _Origin of Species_.\r\nIt requires careful study, but I understand it so far and shall go on.\r\n\r\n_December_ 26.\r\n\r\nI have caught nothing in my traps yet. A little while ago I set a\r\nspringe and two horse-hair nooses in the reed bed for water rails. I\r\nhave bought a book on practical trapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 15.\r\n\r\nI am thinking that on the whole I am a most discontented mortal. I get\r\nfits of what I call \"What's the good of anything\" mania. I keep asking\r\nmyself incessantly till the question wears me out: \"What's the good of\r\ngoing into the country _naturalising_? what's the good of studying so\r\nhard? where is it going to end? will it lead anywhere?\"\r\n\r\n_February_ 17.\r\n\r\nWhen I can get hold of any one interested in Natural History I talk away\r\nin the most garrulous manner and afterwards feel ashamed of myself for\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\n_May_ 15.\r\n\r\n_The Captain_, in answer to my letter, advises me to join one of the\r\nordinary professions and then follow up Nat. History as a recreation, or\r\nelse join Science Classes at S. Kensington, or else by influence get a\r\npost in the Natural History Museum. But I shall see.\r\n\r\n_June_ 9.\r\n\r\nDuring dinner hour, between morning and afternoon school, went out on\r\nthe S---- B---- River Bank, and found another Sedge Warbler's nest. This\r\nis the fifth I have found this year. People who live opposite on the\r\nT---- V---- hear them sing at night and think they are Nightingales!\r\n\r\n_June_ 27.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the past egg-season, I find in all I have discovered 232\r\nnests belonging to forty-four species. I only hope I shall be as\r\nsuccessful with the beetle-season.\r\n\r\n_August_ 15.\r\n\r\nA hot, sultry afternoon, during most of which I was stretched out on the\r\ngrass beside an upturned stone where a battle royal was fought between\r\nYellow and Black Ants. The victory went to the hardy little Yellows....\r\nBy the way, I held a Newt by the tail to-day and it emitted a squeak! So\r\nthat the Newt has a voice after all.\r\n\r\n_August_ 26.\r\n\r\nIn bed with a feverish cold. I am afraid I have very few Nat. His.\r\nobservations to make. It is hard to observe anything at all when lying\r\nin bed in a dull bedroom with one small window. Gulls and Starlings\r\npass, steam engines whistle, horses' feet clatter down the street, and\r\nsometimes the voice of a passer-by reaches me, and often the loud laugh\r\nthat speaks the vacant mind. I can also hear my own cough echoing\r\nthrough my head, and, by the evening, the few pages of Lubbock's _Ants,\r\nBees, and Wasps_ which I struggled to get through during the day rattle\r\nthrough my brain till I am disgusted to find I have them by heart. The\r\nclock strikes midnight and I wait for the morning. Oh! what a weary\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n_October_ 13.\r\n\r\nDown with another cold. Feeling pretty useless. It's a wonder I don't\r\ndevelop melancholia.\r\n\r\n_November_ 6.\r\n\r\nBy 7 a.m. H---- and I were down on the mudflats of the River with\r\nfield-glasses, watching Waders. Ringed Plover in great numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1906\r\n\r\n_January_ 13.\r\n\r\nI have always had one ambition to be a great naturalist. That is, I\r\nsuppose, a child's fancy, and I can see my folly in hoping for such\r\ngreat things. Still, there is no reason why I should not become a\r\n_learned_ naturalist if I study hard. I hope that whatever I do I shall\r\ndo in the hope of increasing knowledge of truth and not for my own fame.\r\nThis entry may suggest that I am horribly conceited. But really I am as\r\nhumble as possible. I know I have advanced beyond many others, and I\r\nknow I shall advance further, but why be conceited?... What a short life\r\nwe have, and what heaps of glorious work to be done! Supper bell--so I\r\nam off.... This reads like Isaac Walton's funny mixtures of the sublime\r\nwith the ridiculous. He discusses abstract happiness and the best salmon\r\nsauce all in one breath.\r\n\r\n_February_ 26.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a grand achievement to have added but one jot or tittle\r\nto the sum of human knowledge it is grander still to have added a\r\nthought. It is best for a man to try to be both poet and naturalist--not\r\nto be too much of a naturalist and so overlook the beauty of things, or\r\ntoo much of a poet and so fail to understand them or even perceive those\r\nhidden beauties only revealed by close observation.\r\n\r\n_March_ 17.\r\n\r\nWoke up this morning covered with spots, chest inflamed, and bad cough.\r\nH---- carted me down from the Attic to the Lower Bedroom, and when the\r\nDr. came he confirmed the general opinion that I had measles. It is\r\nsimply disgusting, I have somewhere near 10,000 spots on me.\r\n\r\n_April_ 27.\r\n\r\nWent to A---- Woods, where, strange to say, I again saw Mary. But she\r\nhad a tribe of friends with her, so did not speak, but watched her from\r\na distance through my field-glasses.\r\n\r\n_May_ 8.\r\n\r\nOn interviewing my old friend Dr. H----, found I had chickenpox. This\r\ninstead of being a Diary of a Naturalist's observations[1] will be one\r\nof infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n_May_ 28.\r\n\r\n[Letter from Editor of _Countryside_ to my brother saying that if the\r\n_Countryside_ grew he might be able to offer me a billet. \"Meanwhile he\r\nwill be able to get along with his pen ... he will soon make a living\r\nand in time too a name.\"] This is a bit of all right. I shall always be\r\non the look-out for a job on a N.H. Journal.\r\n\r\n_December_ 7.\r\n\r\nWent to F---- Duckponds. Flocks of Wigeon and Teal on the water. Taking\r\nadvantage of a dip in the land managed to stalk them splendidly, and for\r\nquite a long time I lay among the long grass watching them through my\r\nfield-glasses. But during the day Wild Duck are not particularly lively\r\nor interesting birds. They just rest serenely on the water like floating\r\ncorks on a sheet of glass. Occasionally one will paddle around lazily.\r\nBut for the most part they show a great ennui and seem so sleepy and\r\ntired that one would almost think to be able to approach and feed them\r\nout of the hand. But I moved one hand carelessly and the whole flock was\r\nup in a minute and whizzing across the river. Afterwards, at dusk, on\r\nreturning to the ponds, they had come back; but now that the sun was\r\ndown, those dozy, flapdoodle creatures of the afternoon were transformed\r\ninto quacking, quarrelsome, blustering birds that squabbled and chivvied\r\neach other, every moment seizing the chance of a luxurious dip, flinging\r\nthe ice-cold water off their backs with a shake of the tail that seemed\r\nto indicate the keenest-edged delight.\r\n\r\nIt was now quite dark. A Snipe rose at my feet and disappeared into the\r\ndarkness. Coots and Moorhens clekked, and a Little Grebe grew bold and\r\nbegan to dive and fish quite close to me, methodically working its way\r\nupstream and so quartering out its feeding area.\r\n\r\nA happy half-hour! Alas! I enjoy these moments the more as they recede.\r\nNot often do I realise the living present. That is always difficult. It\r\nis the mere shades--the ghosts of the dead days--that are dearest to me.\r\n\r\nSpent my last day at school. De Quincey says (or was it Johnson?) that\r\nwhenever we do anything for the last time, provided we have done it\r\nregularly for years before, we are a little melancholy, even though it\r\nhas been distasteful to us.... True.\r\n\r\n_December_ 14.\r\n\r\nSigned my Death Warrant, _i.e._, my articles apprenticing me to\r\njournalism for five years. By Jove! I shall work frantically during the\r\nnext five years so as to be ready at the end of them to take up a\r\nNatural History appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Up to 1911, the Journal is mainly devoted to records of observations\r\nin general Natural History and latterly in Zoology alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1907\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_ 1.\r\n\r\nAs long as he has good health, a man need never despair. Without good\r\nhealth, I _might_ keep a long while in the race, yet as the goal of my\r\nambition grew more and more unattainable I should surely remember the\r\nwords of Keats and give up: \"There is no fiercer Hell than the failure\r\nof a great ambition.\"\r\n\r\n_March_ 14.\r\n\r\nHave been reading through the Chemistry Course in the Harmsworth\r\n_Self-Educator_ and learning all the latest facts and ideas about\r\nradium. I would rather have a clear comprehension of the atom as a solar\r\nsystem than a private income of £100 a year. If only I had eyes to go on\r\nreading without a stop!\r\n\r\n_May_ 1.\r\n\r\nMet an old gentleman in E----, a naturalist with a great contempt for\r\nthe Book of Genesis. He wanted to know how the Kangaroo leapt from\r\nAustralia to Palestine and how Noah fed the animals in the Ark. He\r\nrejects the Old T. theogony and advised me to read \"Darwin and J.G.\r\nWood!\" Silly old man!\r\n\r\n_May_ 22.\r\n\r\nTo Challacombe and then walked across Exmoor. This is the first time I\r\nhave been on Exmoor. My first experience of the Moors came bursting in\r\non me with a flood of ideas, impressions, and delights. I cannot write\r\nout the history of to-day. It would take too long and my mind is a\r\npalpitating tangle. I have so many things to record that I cannot record\r\none of them. Perhaps the best thing to do would be to draw up an\r\ninventory of things seen and heard and trust to my memory to fill in the\r\ndetails when in the future I revert to this date. Too much joy, like too\r\nmuch pain, simply makes me prostrate. It wounds the organism. It is too\r\nmuch. I shall try to forget it all as quickly as possible so as to be\r\nable to return to egg-collecting and bird-watching the sooner as a calm\r\nand dispassionate observer. Yet these dear old hills. How I love them. I\r\ncannot leave them without one friendly word. I wish I were a shepherd!\r\n\r\nAt the \"Ring of Bells\" had a long yarn with the landlord, who, as he\r\ntold us the story of his life, was constantly interrupted but never\r\ndisconcerted by the exuberant loyalty and devotion of his wife--a stout,\r\nflorid, creamy woman, who capped every story with: \"Ees quite honest,\r\nsir; no 'arm at all in old Joshua.\"\r\n\r\n_June_ 5.\r\n\r\nA half-an-hour of to-day I spent in a punt under a copper beech out of\r\nthe pouring rain listening to Lady ----'s gamekeeper at A---- talk about\r\nbeasts and local politics--just after a visit of inspection to the\r\nHeronry in the firs on the island in the middle of the Lake. It was\r\ndelightful to hear him describing a Heron killing an Eel with \"a dap on\r\nthe niddick,\" helping out the figure with a pat on the nape of his thick\r\nbull neck.\r\n\r\n_July_ 22.\r\n\r\nAm reading Huxley's _Crayfish_. H---- brought me in that magnificent\r\naculeate _Chrysis ignita_.\r\n\r\n_August_ 15.\r\n\r\nMet _her_ in the market with M----. I just lifted my hat and passed on.\r\nShe has the most marvellous brown eyes I have ever seen. She is\r\nperfectly self-possessed. A bad sign this.\r\n\r\n_August_ 18.\r\n\r\nWhen I feel ill, cinema pictures of the circumstances of my death flit\r\nacross my mind's eye. I cannot prevent them. I consider the nature of\r\nthe disease and all I said before I died--something heroic, of course!\r\n\r\n_August_ 31.\r\n\r\nShe is a ripping girl. Her eyes are magnificent. I have never seen any\r\none better looking.\r\n\r\n_October_ 1.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon dissected a Frog, following Milnes Marshall's Book. Am\r\nstudying Chemistry and attending classes at the Evening School and\r\nreading Physiology (Foster's). Am also teaching myself German. I wish I\r\nhad a microscope.\r\n\r\n_October_ 3.\r\n\r\nWhat heaps of things to be done! How short the time to do them in! An\r\nappetite for knowledge is apt to rush one off one's feet, like any other\r\nappetite if not curbed. I often stand in the centre of the Library here\r\nand think despairingly how impossible it is ever to become possessed of\r\nall the wealth of facts and ideas contained in the books surrounding me\r\non every hand. I pull out one volume from its place and feel as if I\r\nwere no more than giving one dig with a pick in an enormous quarry. The\r\nPorter spends his days in the Library keeping strict vigil over this\r\ncatacomb of books, passing along between the shelves and yet never\r\npaying heed to the almost audible susurrus of desire--the desire every\r\nbook has to be taken down and read, to live, to come into being in\r\nsomebody's mind. He even hands the volumes over the counter, seeks them\r\nout in their proper places or returns them there without once realising\r\nthat a Book is a Person and not a Thing. It makes me shudder to think of\r\nLamb's _Essays_ being carted about as if they were fardels.\r\n\r\n_October_ 16.\r\n\r\nDissected an Eel. Cassell's _Natural History_ says the Air-bladder is\r\ndivided. This is not so in the one I opened. Found what I believe to be\r\nthe lymphatic heart in the tail beneath the vent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1908\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_ 10.\r\n\r\nAm working frantically so as to keep up my own work with the daily\r\nbusiness of reporting. Shorthand, type-writing, German, Chemistry\r\nclasses, Electricity lectures, Zoology (including dissections) and field\r\nwork. Am reading Mosenthal's _Muscle and Nerve_.\r\n\r\n_April_ 7.\r\n\r\nSectioned a leech. H---- has lent me a hand microtome and I have\r\nborrowed an old razor. My table in the Attic is now fitted up quite like\r\na Laboratory. I get up every morning at 6 a.m. to dissect. Have worked\r\nat the Anatomy of _Dytiscus, Lumbricus_, another Leech, and _Petromyzon\r\nfluviatilis_ all collected by myself. The \"branchial basket\" of\r\n_Petromyzon_ interested me vastly. But it's a brute to dissect.[1]\r\n\r\n_May_ 1.\r\n\r\nCycled to the Lighthouse at the mouth of the Estuary. Underneath some\r\ntelegraph wires, picked up a Landrail in excellent condition. The colour\r\nof the wings is a beautiful warm chestnut. While sweeping the sandhills\r\nwith my field-glasses in search of Ring Plover, which nest there in the\r\nshingle beaches, I espied a Shelduck (_Tadorna_) squatting on a piece of\r\nlevel ground. On walking up cautiously, found it was dead--a Drake in\r\nsplendid plumage and quite fresh and uninjured. Put him in my poacher's\r\npocket, alongside of the Landrail. My coat looked rather bulgy, for a\r\nShelduck is nearly as big as a Goose. Heard a Grasshopper Warbler--a\r\nrare bird in North ----. Later, after much patient watching, saw the\r\nbird in a bramble bush, creeping about like a mouse.\r\n\r\nOn the sea-shore picked up a number of Sea Mice (_Aphrodite_) and\r\nbottled them in my jar of 70 per cent., as they will come in useful for\r\ndissection. Also found the cranium of a _Scyllium_, which I will\r\ndescribe later on.\r\n\r\nNear the Lighthouse watched some fishermen bring in a large Salmon in a\r\nseine net worked from the shore. It was most exciting. Cycled down three\r\nmiles of hard sand with the wind behind me to the village where I had\r\ntea and--as if nothing could stay to-day's good luck--met Margaret ----.\r\nI showed her one by one all my treasures--Rail, Duck, Skull, Sea Mice,\r\netc., and felt like Thomas Edward, beloved of Samuel Smiles. To her I\r\nmust have appeared a very ridiculous person.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it's the skull of a dog-fish?\" she asked, incredulous.\r\n\r\n\"How do I know anything?\" I said, a little piqued.\r\n\r\nOn arriving home found T---- awaiting me with the news that he had\r\ndiscovered a Woodpecker's nest. When will the luck cease? I have never\r\nhad such a flawless ten hours in _le grand air_. These summer days eat\r\ninto my being. The sea has been roaring into my ears and the sun blazing\r\ndown so that even the backs of my hands are sunburnt. And then: those\r\ncoal-black eyes. Ah! me, she _is_ pretty.\r\n\r\n_May_ 2.\r\n\r\nDissected the Sheldrake. Very entertained to discover the extraordinary\r\nasymmetry of the syrinx....\r\n\r\n_May_ 3.\r\n\r\nDissected Corncrake, examining carefully the pessulus, bronchidesmus\r\n(incomplete), _tympani-form and semi-lunar_ membranes of a very\r\ninteresting syrinx....\r\n\r\n_May_ 6.\r\n\r\nDissected one of the Sea Mice. It has a remarkable series of hepatic\r\nducts running into the alimentary canal as in Nudibranchs....\r\n\r\n_May_ 9.\r\n\r\n_Spring in the Woods_\r\n\r\nAmong the Oak Saplings we seemed enveloped in a cloud of green. The tall\r\ngreen grasses threw up a green light against the young green of the\r\nOaks, and the sun managed to trickle through only here and there. Bevies\r\nof swinging bluebells grew in patches among the grass. Overhead in the\r\noaks I heard secret leaf whispers--those little noiseless noises. Birds\r\nand trees and flowers were secretive and mysterious like expectant\r\nmotherhood. All the live things plotted together, having the same big\r\nbusiness in hand. Out in the sunlit meadows, there was a different\r\ninfluence abroad. Here everything was gay, lively, irresponsible. The\r\nbrook prattled like an inconsequential schoolgirl. The Marsh Marigolds\r\nin flamboyant yellow sunbonnets played ring-a-ring-a-roses.\r\n\r\nAn Oak Sapling should make an elderly man avuncular. There are so many\r\ntremendous possibilities about a well-behaved young oak that it is\r\ntempting to put a hand upon its shoulder and give some seasoned,\r\ntimberly advice.\r\n\r\n_June_ 1.\r\n\r\n_A Small Red Viper_\r\n\r\nWent to L---- Sessions. After the Court rose, I transcribed my notes\r\nquickly and walked out to the famous Valley of Rocks which Southey\r\ndescribed as the ribs of the old Earth poking through. At the bottom of\r\none of the hills saw a snake, a Red Viper. Put my boot on him quickly so\r\nthat he couldn't get away and then recognised him as a specimen of what\r\nI consider to be the fourth species of British Serpent--_Vipera rubra_.\r\nThe difficulty was to know how to secure him. This species is more\r\nferocious than the ordinary _V. bera_, and I did not like the idea of\r\nputting my hand down to seize him by the neck. I stood for some time\r\nwith my foot so firmly pressed down on its back that my leg ached and I\r\nbegan to wonder if I had been bitten. I held on and presently hailed a\r\nbaker's cart coming along the road. The man got out and ran across the\r\ngrass to where I stood. I showed him what I had beneath my boot and he\r\nproduced a piece of string which I fastened around the snake's tail and\r\nso gently hauled the little brute up. It already appeared moribund, but\r\nI squashed its head on the grass with my heel to make certain. After\r\nparting with the baker, to whom all thanks be given, I remember that\r\nAdders are tenacious of life and so I continue to carry him at string's\r\nlength and occasionally wallop him against a stone. As he was lifeless I\r\nwrapped him in paper and put him in my pocket--though to make assurance\r\ndoubly sure I left the string on and let its end hang out over my\r\npocket. So home by a two hours' railway journey with the adder in the\r\npocket of my overcoat and the overcoat on the rack over my head. Settled\r\ndown to the reading of a book on Spinoza's _Ethics_. At home it proved\r\nto be quite alive, and, on being pulled out by the string, coiled up on\r\nthe drawing-room floor and hissed in a fury, to my infinite surprise.\r\nFinished him off with the poker and so spoilt the skin.\r\n\r\n_July_ 18.\r\n\r\nHave had toothache for a week. Too much of a coward to have it out.\r\nStarted for P---- early in the morning to report Mr. Duke, K.C. After a\r\nweek's pain, felt a little dicky. All the way in the train kept\r\nhardening myself to the task in front of me by recollecting the example\r\nof Zola, who killed pain with work. So all day to-day I have endeavoured\r\nto act as if I had no pain--the worst of all pains--toothache. By the\r\ntime I got home I was rather done up, but the pain was actually less.\r\nThis gave me a furious joy, and, after days of morose silence, to-night\r\nat supper I made them all laugh by bursting out violently with, \"I don't\r\nknow whether you know it but I've had a horrible day to-day.\" I\r\nexplained at length and received the healing ointment of much sympathy.\r\nWent to bed happy with tooth still aching. I fear it was scarcely\r\nplaying the strict Zolaesque game to divulge the story of my\r\nsufferings.... No, I am not a martyr or a saint. Just an ordinary devil\r\nwho's having a rough time.\r\n\r\n_August_ 17.\r\n\r\n_Prawning_\r\n\r\nHad a glorious time on the rocks at low tide prawning. Caught some\r\nFive-Bearded Rocklings and a large _Cottus bubalis_. The sun did not\r\nsimply shine to-day--it came rushing down from the sky in a cataract and\r\nflooded the sands with light. Sitting on a rock, with prawning net over\r\nmy knees I looked along three miles of flat hard and yellow sands. The\r\nsun poured down on them so heavily that it seemed to raise a luminous\r\ngolden yellow dust for about three feet high.\r\n\r\nOn the rocks was a pretty flapper in a pink sunbonnet--also prawning in\r\ncompany of S----, the artist, who has sent her picture to the Royal\r\nAcademy. They saw I was a naturalist, so my services were secured to\r\npronounce my judgment on a \"fish\" she had caught. It was a Squid, \"an\r\nodd little beast,\" in truth, as she said. \"The same class of animal,\" I\r\nvolunteered, \"as the Cuttlefish and Octopus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it sting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it ought to with a face like that.\" She laughed merrily, and the\r\nbearded but youthful artist laughed too.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about these things,\" he said hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said the naturalist modestly. \"I study fish.\"\r\n\r\nThis was puzzling. \"Fish?\" What was a Squid then?\r\n\r\n... The artist would stop now and then and raise his glasses at a\r\npassing ship, and Maud's face occasionally disappeared in the pink\r\nsunbonnet as she stooped over a pool to examine a seaweed or crab.\r\n\r\nShe's a dear--and she gave me the Squid. What a merry little cuss!\r\n\r\n_September_ 1.\r\n\r\nWent with Uncle to see a Wesleyan minister whose fame as a microscopist,\r\naccording to Uncle, made it worth my while to visit him. As I expected,\r\nhe was just a silly old man, a diatomaniac fond of pretty-pretty slides\r\nand not a scientific man at all. He lectures Bands of Hope on the\r\nButterfly's Life History and hates his next-door neighbour, who is also\r\na microscopist and incidentally a scientific man, because he interests\r\nhimself in \"parasites and those beastly things.\"\r\n\r\nI remarked that his friend next door had shown me an Amphioxus.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I expect that's some beastly bacteria thing,\" he said petulantly.\r\n\"I can't understand Wilkinson. He's a pervert.\"\r\n\r\nI told him what _Amphioxus_ was and laughed up my sleeve. He likes to\r\nthink of Zoology as a series of pretty pictures illustrating beautiful\r\nmoral truths. The old fellow's saving grace was enthusiasm.... Having\r\nfocused an object for us, he would stand by, breathless, while we\r\nsquinted down his gas-tube, and gave vent to tremendous expletives of\r\nsurprise such as \"Heavens,\" or \"Jupiter.\" His eyes would twinkle with\r\ndelight and straightway another miracle is selected for us to view.\r\n\"They are all miracles,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Those are the valves\"--washing his hands with invisible soap--\"no one\r\nhas yet been able to solve the problem of the Diatom's valves. No one\r\nknows what they are--no, nor ever will know--why?--why can't we see\r\nbehind the valves?--because God is behind the valves--that is why!\"\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n_October_ 1.\r\n\r\nTelegraphed 1,000 words of Lord ----'s speech at T----.\r\n\r\nSpent the night at a comfortable country inn and read Moore's lyrics.\r\n\"Row gently here, my Gondolier,\" ran through my head continuously. The\r\nInn is an old one with a long narrow passage that leads straight from\r\nfront door to back with wainscoted smoke room and parlours on each side.\r\nChina dogs, bran on the floor, and the picture of Derby Day with horses\r\ngalloping incredibly, the drone of an old crony in the bar, and a\r\npleasant barmy smell. Slept in a remarkable bedroom full of massive\r\nfurniture, draped with cloth and covered with trinkets. The bed had a\r\ntremendous hood over it like a catafalque, and lying in it made me think\r\nI was an effigy. Read Moore till the small hours and then found I had\r\nleft my handbag downstairs. Lit a candle and went on a voyage of\r\ndiscovery. Made a considerable noise, but roused no one. Entered\r\ndrawing-room, kitchen, pantries, parlour, bar--everywhere looking for my\r\nbag and dropping candle grease everywhere! Slept in my day shirt. Tired\r\nout and slept like a top.\r\n\r\n_November_ 3.\r\n\r\n_Aristotle's Lantern_\r\n\r\nDissected the Sea Urchin (_Echinus esculentus_). Very excited over my\r\nfirst view of Aristotle's Lantern. These complicated pieces of animal\r\nmechanism never smell of musty age--after æons of evolution. When I open\r\na Sea Urchin and see the Lantern, or dissect a Lamprey and cast eyes on\r\nthe branchial basket, such structures strike me as being as finished and\r\nexquisite as if they had just a moment before been tossed me fresh from\r\nthe hands of the Creator. They are fresh, young, they smell _new_.\r\n\r\n_December_ 3.\r\n\r\nHard at work dissecting a Dogfish. Ruridecanal Conference in the\r\nafternoon. I enjoy this double life I lead. It amazes me to be laying\r\nbare the brain of a dogfish in the morning and in the afternoon to be\r\ntaking down in shorthand what the Bishop says on Mission Work.\r\n\r\n_December_ 4.\r\n\r\nWent to the Veterinary Surgeon and begged of him the skull of a horse.\r\nCarried the trophy home under my arm--bare to the public view. \"Why,\r\nLor', 'tis an ole 'orse's jib,\" M---- said when I got back.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] There are numerous drawings of dissections scattered through the\r\nJournal about this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1909\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_ 7.\r\n\r\nMy programme of work is: (1) Continue German. (2) Sectioning embryo of\r\n(_a_) Fowl, (_b_) Newt. (3) Paper on Arterial System of Newts. (4)\r\nPsychology of Newts. (5) General Zoological Reading.\r\n\r\n_May_ 2.\r\n\r\nTo C---- Hill. Too much taken with the beauty of the Woods to be able to\r\ndo any nesting. Here are some of the things I saw: the bark on several\r\nof the trees in the mazzard orchards rubbed into a beautifully smooth,\r\npolished surface by the Red Devon Cows when scratching where it itched;\r\nI put my hand on the smooth almost cherry-red patch of bark and felt\r\ndelighted and grateful that cows had fleas: the young shoots of the\r\nwhortle-berry plants on the hill were red tipped with the gold of an\r\nalmost horizontal sun. I caught a little lizard which slipped across my\r\npath.... Afar off down in the valley I had come through, in a convenient\r\nbreak in a holly bush, I could just see a Cow sitting on her matronly\r\nhaunches in a field. She flicked her ears and two starlings settled on\r\nher back. A Rabbit swept out of a sweet-brier bush, and a Magpie flew\r\nout of the hedge on my right.\r\n\r\nIn another direction I could see a field full of luscious, tall, green\r\ngrass. Every stalk was so full of sap that had I cut one I am sure it\r\nwould have bled great green drops. In the field some lambs were\r\nsleeping; one woke up and looked at me with the back of its head to the\r\nlow sun, which shone through its two small ears and gave them a\r\ntransparent pink appearance.\r\n\r\nNo sooner am I rebaptized in the sun than I have to be turning home\r\nagain. No sooner do \"the sudden lilies push between the loosening fibres\r\nof the heart\" than I am whisked back into the old groove--the daily\r\nround. If only I had more time!--more time in which to think, to love,\r\nto observe, to frame my disposition, to direct as far as in me lies the\r\ndevelopment and unfolding of my character, if only I could direct all my\r\nenergies to the great and difficult profession of life, of being man\r\ninstead of trifling with one profession that bores me and dabbling in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n_June_ 5.\r\n\r\n_On Lundy Island_\r\n\r\nFrankie is blowing Seagulls' eggs in the scullery. His father, after a\r\nday's work at the farm, is at his supper very hungry, yet immensely\r\ninterested, and calls out occasionally,--\r\n\r\n\"'Ow you're getting on, Foreman?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Capt.,\" says Frankie affectionately, and the unpleasant\r\nasthmatic, wheezy noise of the egg-blowing goes on.... There are three\r\ndogs asleep under the kitchen table; all three belong to different\r\nowners and neither one to A----.\r\n\r\n_June_ 6.\r\n\r\nOur egg-collecting with the Lighthouse Keepers. They walk about the\r\ncliffs as surefooted as cats, and feed their dogs on birds' eggs\r\ncollected in a little bag at the end of a long pole. One dog ate three\r\nright off in as many minutes, putting his teeth through and cracking the\r\nshell, then lapping up the contents. Crab for tea.\r\n\r\n_June_ 7.\r\n\r\nAfter a glorious day at the N. end of the Island with the Puffins, was\r\nforced to-night to take another walk, as the smell of Albert's tobacco,\r\ntogether with that of his stockinged feet and his boots removed, was\r\nasphyxiating.\r\n\r\n_June_ 9.\r\n\r\nThe governess is an awfully pretty girl. We have been talking together\r\nto-day and she asked me if I were a naturalist. I said \"Yes.\" She said,\r\n\"Well, I found a funny little beetle yesterday and Mr. S---- said I\r\nought to have given it to you.\" Later, I felt she was looking at me, so\r\nI looked at her, across the beach. Yes! it was true. When our eyes met\r\nshe gave me one of the most provokingly pretty smiles, then turned and\r\nwent up the cliff path and so out of my life--to my everlasting regret.\r\n\r\nReturn to-night in a cattle steamer.\r\n\r\n_June_ 18.\r\n\r\nDr.----, M.A., F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D., called in the office to-day, and\r\nseeing Dad typing, said, \"Are you Mr. Barbellion?\" Dad replied in the\r\naffirmative, whereupon the Doctor handed him his card, and Dad said he\r\nthought it was his son he wanted to see. He is an old gentleman aged\r\neighty or thereabouts, with elastic-sided boots, an umbrella, and a\r\nguardian nephew--a youngster of about sixty. But I paid him due\r\nreverence as a celebrated zoologist and at his invitation [and to my\r\ninfinite pride] accompanied him on an excursion to the coast, where he\r\nwanted to see _Philoscia Couchii_, which I readily turned up for him.\r\n\r\nI chanced to remark that I thought torsion in gastropods one of the most\r\nfascinating and difficult problems in Zoology. Why should a snail be\r\ntwisted round?\r\n\r\n\"Humph,\" said he, \"why do we stand upright?\" I was not such a fool as to\r\nargue with him, so pretended his reply was a knock-out. But it enabled\r\nme to size him up intellectually.\r\n\r\nIn the evening dined with him at his hotel.... He knows Wallace and\r\nHaeckel personally, and I sat at his feet with my tongue out listening\r\nto personal reminiscences of these great men. However, he seemed never\r\nto have heard of Gaskell's Theory on the Origin of Vertebrates.\r\n\r\n_June_ 27.\r\n\r\nWalked to V----. As usual, Nature with clockwork regularity had all her\r\ntaps turned on--larks singing, cherries ripening, and bees humming. It\r\nall bored me a little. Why doesn't she vary it a little?\r\n\r\n_August_ 8.\r\n\r\nA cold note from Dr. ---- saying that he cannot undertake the\r\nresponsibility of advising me to give up journalism for zoology.\r\n\r\nA hellish cold in the head. Also a swingeing inflammation of the eyes.\r\nJust heard them singing in the Chapel over the way: \"God shall wipe away\r\nall tears from their eyes.\" Hope so, I'm sure.\r\n\r\n_August_ 9.\r\n\r\nA transformation. After a long series of drab experiences in Sheffield,\r\netc., the last being the climax of yesterday, an anti-cyclone arrived\r\nthis morning and I sailed like an Eagle into cloudless, windless\r\nweather! _The Academy_ has published my article, my cold is suddenly\r\nbetter, and going down by the sea this afternoon met Mary ----!\r\n\r\n_August_ 20.\r\n\r\nHad an amusing letter from my maiden-aunt F----, who does not like \"the\r\nagnostic atmosphere\" in my _Academy_ article. Poor dear! She is sorry if\r\nI really feel like that, and, if I do, what a pity to put it into print.\r\nThen a Bible reference to the Epistle to the Romans.\r\n\r\n_Xmas Day_.\r\n\r\nFeeling ill--like a sloppy Tadpole. My will is paralysed. I visit the\r\nDoctor regularly to be stethoscoped, ramble about the streets, idly scan\r\nmagazines in the Library and occasionally rink--with palpitation of the\r\nheart as a consequence. In view of the shortness, bitterness, and\r\nuncertainty of life, all scientific labour for me seems futile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1910\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 10.\r\n\r\nBetter, but still very dicky: a pallid animal: a weevil in a nut. I have\r\na weak heart, an enervated nervous system; I suffer from lack of funds\r\nwith which to carry on my studies; I hate\r\nnewspaper-reporting--particularly some skinny-witted speaker like ----;\r\nand last, but not least, there are women; all these worries fight over\r\nmy body like jackals over carrion. Yet Zoology is all I want. Why won't\r\nLife leave me alone?\r\n\r\n_January_ 15.\r\n\r\nReading Hardy's novels. He is altogether delightful in the subtlety with\r\nwhich he lets you perceive the first tiny love presentiments between his\r\nheroes and heroines--the casual touch of the hands, the peep of a foot\r\nor ankle underneath the skirt--all these in Hardy signify the cloud no\r\nbigger than a man's hand. They are the susurrus of the breeze before the\r\nstorm, and you await what is to follow with palpitating heart.\r\n\r\n_February_ 3.\r\n\r\nFor days past have been living in a state of mental ebullition. All\r\nkinds of pictures of Love, Life, and Death have been passing through my\r\nmind. Now I am too indolent and nerveless to set them down. Physically I\r\nam such a wreck that to carry out the least intention, such as putting\r\non my boots, I have to flog my will like an Arab with a slave \"in a sand\r\nof Ayaman.\" Three months ago when I got up before breakfast to dissect\r\nrabbits, dogfish, frogs, newts, etc., this would have seemed impossible.\r\n\r\n_February_ 6.\r\n\r\nStill visit Dr. ----'s surgery each week. I have two dull spots at the\r\nbottom of each lung. What a fine expressive word is _gloom_. Let me\r\nwrite it: GLOOM....\r\n\r\nOne evening coming home in the train from L---- County Sessions I\r\nnoticed a horrible, wheezy sound whenever I breathed deep. I was scared\r\nout of my life, and at once thought of consumption. Went to the Doctor's\r\nnext day, and he sounded me and reassured me. I was afraid to tell him\r\nof the little wheezy sound at the apex of each lung, and I believed he\r\noverlooked it. So next day, very harassed, I went back to him again and\r\ntold him. He _hadn't_ noticed it and looked glum. Have to keep out of\r\ndoors as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThe intense internal life I lead, worrying about my health, reading\r\n(eternally reading), reflecting, observing, feeling, loving and\r\nhating--with no outlet for superfluous steam, cramped and confined on\r\nevery side, without any friends or influence of any sort, without even\r\nany acquaintances excepting my colleagues in journalism (whom I\r\ncontemn)--all this will turn me into the most self-conscious, conceited,\r\nmawkish, gauche creature in existence.\r\n\r\n_March_ 6.\r\n\r\nThe facts are undeniable: Life is pain. No sophistry can win me over to\r\nany other view. And yet years ago I set out so hopefully and\r\nhealthfully--what are birds' eggs to me _now_? My ambition is enormous\r\nbut vague. I am too distributed in my abilities ever to achieve\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\n_March_ 22.\r\n\r\nHad a letter from the Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum, advising\r\nme of three vacancies in his Dept., and asking me if I would like to\r\ntry, etc.... So that Dr. ----'s visit to me bore some fruit.[1] Spent\r\nthe morning day-dreaming.... Perhaps this is the flood tide at last! I\r\nshall work like a drayhorse to pull through if I am nominated.... I\r\nawait developments in a frightfully turbulent state of mind. I have a\r\nfrantic desire to control the factors which are going to affect my\r\nfuture so permanently. And this ferocious desire, of course, collides\r\nwith a crash all day long with the fact that however much I desire there\r\nwill still remain the unalterable logic of events.\r\n\r\n_April_ 7.\r\n\r\n... How delicious all this seemed! To be alive--thinking, seeing,\r\nenjoying, walking, eating--all quite apart from the amount of money in\r\nyour purse or the prospects of a career. I revelled in the sensuous\r\nenjoyment of my animal existence.\r\n\r\n_June_ 2.\r\n\r\nUp to now my life has been one of great internal strife and\r\nstruggle--the struggle with a great ambition and a weak will--unequal to\r\nthe task of coping with it. I have planned on too big a scale, perhaps.\r\nI have put too great a strain on my talents, I have whipped a flagging\r\nwill, I have been for ever cogitating, worrying, devising means of\r\nescape. Meanwhile, the moments have gone by unheeded and unenjoyed.\r\n\r\n_June_ 10.\r\n\r\nLegginess is bad enough in a woman, but bandy legginess is impossible.\r\n\r\nSolitude is good for the soul. After an hour of it, I feel as lofty and\r\nimperial as Marcus Aurelius.\r\n\r\nThe best girl in the best dress immediately looks disreputable if her\r\nstockings be downgyved.\r\n\r\nSome old people on reaching a certain age go on living out of habit--a\r\nbad habit too.\r\n\r\nHow much I can learn of a stranger by his laugh.\r\n\r\nBees, Poppies, and Swallows!--and all they mean to him who really knows\r\nthem! Or a White Gull on a piece of floating timber, or a troop of shiny\r\nRooks close on the heels of a ploughman on a sunny autumn day.\r\n\r\n_June_ 30.\r\n\r\nMy egoism appals me. Likewise the extreme intensification of the\r\nconsciousness of myself. Whenever I walk down the High Street on a\r\nmarket day, my self-consciousness magnifies my proportions to the size\r\nof a Gulliver--so that it is grievous to reflect that in spite of that\r\nthe townsfolk see me only as an insignificant bourgeois youth who\r\nreports meetings in shorthand.\r\n\r\n_July_ 17.\r\n\r\nWe sang to-night in Church, \"But when I know Thee as Thou art, I'll\r\npraise Thee as I ought.\" Exactly! Till then, farewell. We are a great\r\nlittle people, we humans. If there be no next world, still the Spirit of\r\nMan will have lived and uttered its protest.\r\n\r\n_July_ 22.\r\n\r\n_Our Simian Ancestry_\r\n\r\nHow I hate the man who talks about the \"brute creation,\" with an ugly\r\nemphasis on _brute_. Only Christians are capable of it. As for me, I am\r\nproud of my close kinship with other animals. I take a jealous pride in\r\nmy Simian ancestry. I like to think that I was once a magnificent hairy\r\nfellow living in the trees and that my frame has come down through\r\ngeological time _via_ sea jelly and worms and Amphioxus, Fish,\r\nDinosaurs, and Apes. Who would exchange these for the pallid couple in\r\nthe Garden of Eden?\r\n\r\n_August_ 9.\r\n\r\nI do not ever like going to bed. For me each day ends in a little\r\nsorrow. I hate the time when it comes to put my books away, to knock out\r\nmy pipe and say \"Good-night,\" exchanging the vivid pleasures of the day\r\nfor the darkness of sleep and oblivion.\r\n\r\n_August_ 23.\r\n\r\nSpent the afternoon and evening till ten in the woods with Mary ----.\r\nHad tea in the Haunted House, and after sat in the Green Arbor until\r\ndark, when I kissed her. \"Achilles was not the worse warrior for his\r\nprobation in petticoats.\"\r\n\r\n_September_ 1.\r\n\r\nI hope to goodness she doesn't think I want to marry her. In the Park in\r\nthe dark, kissing her. I was testing and experimenting with a new\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n_September_ 4.\r\n\r\nLast evening, after much mellifluous cajolery, induced her to _kiss me_.\r\nMy private opinion about this whole affair is that all the time I have\r\nbeen at least twenty degrees below real love heat. In any case I am\r\nconstitutionally and emotionally unfaithful. I said things which I did\r\nnot believe just because it was dark and she was charming.\r\n\r\n_September_ 5.\r\n\r\nRead Thomas à Kempis in the train. It made me so angry I nearly flung it\r\nout of the window. \"Meddle not with things that be too deep for thee,\"\r\nhe says, \"but read such things as yield compunction to the heart rather\r\nthan elevation to the head.\" Forsooth! Can't you see me?\r\n\r\n_September_ 15.\r\n\r\nA puzzling afternoon: weather perfect, the earth green and humming like\r\na top, yet a web of dream overlaid the great hill, and at certain\r\nmoments, which recurred in a kind of pulsation, accompanied by\r\nsubjective feelings of vague strife and effort, I easily succeeded in\r\nletting all I saw--the field and the blackberry bush, the whole valley\r\nand the apple orchards--change into something unreal, flimsy, gauzelike,\r\nimmaterial, and totally unexperienced. Suddenly when the impression was\r\nmost vivid, the whole of this mysterious tapestry would vanish away and\r\nI was back where 2 and 2 make 4. Oh! Earth! how jealously you guard your\r\nsecrets!\r\n\r\n_October_ 4.\r\n\r\nSat at the Civil Service Commission in Burlington House for the exam,\r\nfor the vacancy in the B.M. No luck at all with the papers. The whole of\r\nmy nine months' assiduous preparation helped me in only two questions.\r\nIn fine, I have not succeeded, I shall not obtain the appointment, and\r\nin a few weeks I shall be back in the wilds of\r\n\r\nN---- again under the old regime, reporting platitudes from greasy\r\nguardians of the poor, and receiving condolences from people not\r\naltogether displeased at some one else's misfortune.\r\n\r\n_October_ 14.\r\n\r\nReturned home from London. Felt horribly defeated in crossing the\r\nthreshold. It was so obviously _returning_ after an unsuccessful flight.\r\n\r\n_October_ 22.\r\n\r\nDissected a _Squilla_ for which I paid 2s. 6d. to the Plymouth Marine\r\nLaboratory.\r\n\r\n_October_ 23.\r\n\r\n_Ambition_\r\n\r\nAm attempting to feel after some practical philosophy of\r\nliving--something that will enable me to accept disappointment with\r\nequanimity and Town Council meetings with a broad and tolerant smile. At\r\npresent, ambition consumes me. I was ambitious before I was breeched. I\r\ncan remember wondering as a child if I were a young Macaulay or Ruskin\r\nand secretly deciding that I was. My infant mind even was bitter with\r\nthose who insisted on regarding me as a normal child and not as a\r\nprodigy. Since then I have struggled with this canker for many a day,\r\nand as success fails to arrive it becomes more gnawing.\r\n\r\n_October_ 24.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a Town Council and in the afternoon a Rural Council. With\r\nthis abominable trash in my notebook waiting to be written up and turned\r\ninto \"copy,\" and with the dream pictures of a quiet studious life in\r\nCromwell Road not yet faded from my mind, where can I turn for\r\nconsolation? That I have done my best? That's only a mother's saying to\r\nher child.\r\n\r\nPerhaps after all it is a narrow life--this diving and delving among\r\ncharming little secrets, plying diligently scalpel and microscope and\r\nthen weaving the facts obtained into theoretic finespun. It is all\r\nvastly entertaining to the naturalist but it leaves the world unmoved. I\r\nsometimes envy the zealot with a definite mission in life. Life without\r\none seems void. The monotonous pursuit of our daily vocations--the\r\nsoldier, sailor, candlestick-maker--so they go on, never living but only\r\nworking, never thinking but only hypnotising themselves by the routine\r\nand punctuality of their lives into just so many mechanical toys\r\nwarranted to go for so long and then stop when Death takes them.... It\r\namazes me that men must spend their precious days of existence for the\r\nmost part in slaving for food and clothing and the bare necessaries of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nTo sum up my despondency, what's the good of such a life? Where does it\r\nlead? Where am I going? Why should I work? What means this procession of\r\nnights and days wherein we are all seen moving along intent and stern as\r\nif we had some purpose or a goal?... Of course to the man who believes\r\nin the next world and a personal God, it is quite another matter. The\r\nChristian is the Egoist _par excellence_. He does not mind annihilation\r\nby arduous labour in this world if in the next he shall have won eternal\r\nlife.... He is reckless of to-day, extravagant in the expenditure of his\r\nlife. This intolerable fellow will be cheerful in a dungeon. For he\r\nflatters himself that God Almighty up in Heaven is all the time watching\r\nthrough the keyhole and marking him down for eternal life.\r\n\r\n_October_ 26.\r\n\r\nThe nose-snuffling, cynical man who studies La Rochefoucauld, and prides\r\nhimself on a knowledge of human motives, is pleased to point out that\r\nevery action and every motive is selfish, from the philanthropist who\r\nadvertises himself by his charities to the fanatic who lays down his\r\nlife for a cause. Even secret charities, for they give pleasure to the\r\ndoer. So your cynic thinks he has thus, with one stroke of his\r\npsychological scalpel, laid human nature bare in all its depravities.\r\nAll he has done really is to reclassify motives--instead of grouping\r\nthem as selfish and unselfish (which is more convenient) he lumps them\r\ntogether as selfish, a method by which even he is forced to recognise\r\ndifferent grades of selfishness. For example, the selfishness of a\r\nwife-beater is lower than the selfishness of a man who gives up his life\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\n_October_ 28.\r\n\r\nThe result arrived. As I thought, I have failed, being fourth with only\r\nthree vacancies.\r\n\r\n_November_ 7.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to bewail the course of fortune. It cannot be much credit\r\nto possess--though we may covet--those precious things, to possess which\r\ndepends on circumstances outside our control.\r\n\r\n_November_ 9.\r\n\r\nDined at the Devonshire Club in St. James's Street, W., with Dr.\r\nH----and Mr. ----, the latter showing the grave symptomatic phenomena of\r\na monocle and spats. A dinner of eight courses. Only made one mistake\r\n--put my salad on my dish instead of on the side dish. Horribly nervous\r\nand reticent. I was apparently expected to give an account of myself and\r\nmy abilities--and with that end in view, they gave me a few pokes in my\r\ncranial ribs. But I am a peculiar animal, and, before unbosoming myself,\r\nI would require a happier _mise-en-scène_ than a West End Club, and a\r\nmore tactful method of approach than ogling by two professors, who\r\nseemed to think I was a simple penny-in-the-slot machine. I froze from\r\nsheer nervousness and nothing resulted.\r\n\r\n_November_ 11.\r\n\r\nReturned home and found a letter awaiting me from Dr. A---- offering me\r\n£60 a year for a temporary job as assistant at the Plymouth Marine\r\nLaboratory.\r\n\r\nLeft London horribly depressed. They evidently intend to shuffle me off.\r\n\r\nRead Geo. Gissing's novel, _Born in Exile_. Godwin Peak, with his\r\nintense pride of individuality, self-torturing capacities, and\r\nsentimental languishment, reminds me of myself.\r\n\r\n_November_ 20.\r\n\r\nA purulent cold in the nose. My heart is weak. Palpitation after the\r\nleast exertion. But I shall soon be swinging my cudgels in the battle of\r\nlife, so it won't do to be hypochondriacal.... Let all the powers of the\r\nworld and the Devil attack me, yet I will win in the end--though the\r\nconquest may very well be one which no one but myself will view.\r\n\r\nHave accepted the Plymouth appointment.\r\n\r\n_November_ 30.\r\n\r\nStruggling in the depths again within the past few days with heart\r\nattacks. Am slowly getting better of them and trying to forget as soon\r\nas may be visions of sudden death, coffins, and obituary notices.\r\n\r\n_December_ 2.\r\n\r\n_Death_\r\n\r\nAt first, when we are very young, Death arouses our curiosity, as it did\r\nCain in the beginning.[2] It is a strange and very rare phenomenon which\r\nwe cannot comprehend, and every time we hear of some one's death, we try\r\nto recall that person's appearance in life and are disappointed if we\r\ncan't. The endeavour is to discover what it is, this Death, to compare\r\ntwo things, the idea of the person alive and the idea of him dead. At\r\nlast some one we know well dies--and that is the first shock.... I shall\r\nnever forget when our Matron died at the D---- School.... As the years\r\nroll on, we get used to the man with the scythe and an acquaintance's\r\ndeath is only a bit of gossip.\r\n\r\nSuppose the Hellfire of the orthodox really existed! We have no\r\nassurance that it does not! It seems incredible, but many incredible\r\nthings are true. We do not _know_ that God is not as cruel as a Spanish\r\ninquisitor. Suppose, then, He is! If, after Death, we wicked ones were\r\nshovelled into a furnace of fire--we should have to burn. There would be\r\nno redress. It would simply be the Divine Order of things. It is\r\noutrageous that we should be so helpless and so dependent on any\r\none--even God.\r\n\r\n_December_ 9.\r\n\r\nSometimes I think I am going mad. I live for days in the mystery and\r\ntears of things so that the commonest object, the most familiar\r\nface--even my own--become ghostly, unreal, enigmatic. I get into an\r\nattitude of almost total scepticism, nescience, solipsism even, in a\r\nworld of dumb, sphinx-like things that cannot explain themselves. The\r\ndiscovery of how I am situated--a sentient being on a globe in space\r\novershadows me. I wish I were just nothing.\r\n\r\n_Later_: While at a public meeting, the office-boy approached me and\r\nimmediately whispered without hesitation,--\r\n\r\n\"Just had a telephone message to say that your father is at the\r\nT----Railway Station, lying senseless. He has evidently had an\r\napoplectic fit.\"\r\n\r\n(How those brutal words, \"lying senseless,\" banged and bullied and\r\nknocked me down. Mother was waiting for me at the door in a dreadful\r\nstate and expecting the worst.)\r\n\r\nMet the train with the Doctor, and took him home in the cab--still\r\nalive, thank God, but helpless. He was brave enough to smile and shake\r\nme by the hand--with his left, though he was speechless and the right\r\nside of his body helpless. A porter discovered him at the railway\r\nterminus lying on the floor of a second-class carriage.\r\n\r\n_December_ 10.\r\n\r\nHe is a trifle better. It is fifteen years since he had the first\r\nparalytic stroke.\r\n\r\nAm taking over all his work and have written at once resigning the\r\nPlymouth appointment.\r\n\r\n_December_ 23.\r\n\r\nIt really did require an effort to go upstairs to-day to his bedroom and\r\nsay cheerfully I was not going to P. after all, and that the matter was\r\nof no consequence to me. I laughed gaily and Dad was relieved. A\r\nthundering good joke. What annoys me is that other folk--the brainless,\r\nheartless mob, as Schopenhauer remarks, still continue to regard me as\r\none of themselves.... I had nearly escaped into a seaside laboratory,\r\nand now suddenly to be flung back into the dirt and sweat of the\r\nnewspaper world seems very hard, and it _is_ very hard.\r\n\r\n_December_ 26.\r\n\r\n_Windy Ash_\r\n\r\nWith the dog for a walk around Windy Ash. It was a beautiful winter's\r\nmorning--a low sun giving out a pale light but no warmth--a luminant,\r\nnot a fire--the hedgerows bare and well trimmed, an Elm lopped close\r\nshowing white stumps which glistened liquidly in the sun, a Curlew\r\nwhistling overhead, a deeply cut lane washed hard and clean by the\r\nwinter rains, a gunshot from a distant cover, a creeping Wren, silent\r\nand tame, in a bramble bush, and over the five-barred gate the granite\r\nroller with vacant shafts. I leaned on the gate and saw the great whisps\r\nof cloud in the sky like comets' tails. Everything cold, crystalline.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] He had spoken about me to the Museum authorities, and it was his\r\ninfluence which got me the nomination to sit for the examination.\r\n\r\n[2] In Byron's poem.\r\n\r\n1911\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 2.\r\n\r\nAs a young man--a _very_ young man--my purpose was to plough up all\r\nobstacles, brook no delays, and without let or hindrance win through to\r\nan almost immediate success! But witness 1910! \"My career\" so far has\r\nbeen like the White Knight's, who fell off behind when the horse\r\nstarted, in front when it stopped, and sideways occasionally to vary the\r\nmonotony.\r\n\r\n_January_ 30.\r\n\r\nFeeling ill and suffering from attacks of faintness. My ill health has\r\nproduced a change in my attitude towards work. As soon as I begin to\r\nfeel the least bit down, I am bound to stop at once as the idea of\r\nbending over a desk or a dissecting dish, of reading or studying,\r\nnauseates me when I think that perhaps to-morrow or next day or next\r\nweek, next month, next year I may be dead. What a waste of life it seems\r\nto work! Zoology is repugnant and philosophy superfluous beside the\r\nbliss of sheer living--out in the cold polar air or indoors in a chair\r\nbefore a roaring fire with hands clasped, watching the bustling,\r\nsoothing activity of the flames.\r\n\r\nThen, as soon as I am well again, I forget all this, grow discontented\r\nwith doing nothing and work like a Tiger.\r\n\r\n_February_ 11.\r\n\r\nWalked in the country. Coming home, terrified by a really violent attack\r\nof palpitation. Almost every one I met I thought would be the\r\nunfortunate person who would have to pick me up. As each one in the\r\nstreet approached me, I weighed him in the balance and considered if he\r\nhad presence of mind and how he would render first aid. After my friend,\r\nP.C. ----, had passed, I felt sorry that the tragedy had not already\r\nhappened, for he knows me and where I live. At length, after sundry\r\nleanings over the river wall, arrived at the Library, which I entered,\r\nand sat down, when the full force of the palpitation was immediately\r\nfelt. My face burned with the hot blood, my hand holding the paper shook\r\nwith the angry pulse, and my heart went bang! bang! bang! and I could\r\nfeel its beat in the carotids of the neck and up along the Torcular\r\nherophili and big vessels in the occipital region of the head. Drew in\r\neach breath very gently for fear of aggravating the fiend. Got home\r\n(don't know how) and had some sal volatile. Am better now but very\r\ndemoralised.\r\n\r\n_February_ 13.\r\n\r\nFeel like a piece of drawn threadwork, or an undeveloped negative, or a\r\njelly fish on stilts, or a sloppy tadpole, or a weevil in a nut, or a\r\nspitchcocked eel. In other words and in short--ill.\r\n\r\n_February_ 16.\r\n\r\nAfter some days with the vision of sudden death constantly before me,\r\nhave come to the conclusion that it's a long way to go to die. Am coming\r\nback anyhow. Yet these are a few terrible pages in my history.\r\n\r\n_March_ 4.\r\n\r\n... The Doctor's orders \"Cease Work\" have brought on in an aggravated\r\nform my infatuation for zoological research. I lie in bed and\r\nmanufacture rolling periods in praise of it, I get dithyrambic over the\r\nzoologists themselves--Huxley, Wallace, Brooks, Lankester. I chortle to\r\nreflect that in zoology there are no stock exchange ambitions, there is\r\nno mention of slum life, Tariff Reform is not included. In the repose of\r\nthe spacious laboratory by the seaside or in the halls of some great\r\nMuseum, life with its vulgar struggles, its hustle and obscenity,\r\nscarcely penetrates. Behind those doors, life flows slowly, deeply. I am\r\nascetic and long for the monastic seclusion of a student's life.\r\n\r\n_March_ 5.\r\n\r\n_From One Maiden Lady to Another_. (_Authentic_)\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sister,--You have been expecting to hear from me I know, I have\r\nhad inflammation to my eyes twice in 3 weeks so I thought I had better\r\nlet the Doctor see and he says it is catarrh of the eyes and windpipe. I\r\nam inhaling and taking lozenges and medicine. You will be sorry to learn\r\nLeonora Mims has been taken to a Sanatorium with Diptheria, we heard\r\nyesterday, she is better, poor Mrs. Mims herself quite an invalid, she\r\nhas to walk with a stick, I believe you know she has had to have her\r\nbreast cut off, they keep a servant as she can't do anything, old Mrs.\r\nPoint is 87 I think it is so they too have a lot of trouble, Fred Mims\r\nhas just got married....\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Mrs. Seemsoe is just the same, she doesn't know anybody but\r\nshe talks, the nurse put a grape in her mouth but she didn't know what\r\nto do with it, I think it is very sad. She was taken about a fortnight\r\nbefore Easter. Will you tell me dear if this is right receipt for\r\nclothes 1/2 oz. carbolic in 1/2 pint of rose water. Harry Gammon's 2\r\nlittle children have measles, poor Maisie has gone with her Aunt Susan,\r\npoor old Joe Gammon they say had very little to leave, we don't know\r\nwhere Robert gets his money from. I dare say you saw that Tom Sagg has\r\nmarried another of Ned Smith's daughters and we hear these Smith girls\r\nare rare housekeepers and this girl that has married Tom Sagg has made\r\nall her own linen. Mrs. Wilkins, the butcher's wife is going to have a\r\nlittle one after 15 years, our Vicar has been laid up with an abscess,\r\nhe told us about his brother the other day, he says as brothers they\r\nlove each other very much. We have 3 very sad cases of men ill in the\r\nvillage. We had 4 but one man died of cancer.\r\n\r\n\"Yr loving Sister Amy.\"\r\n\r\nVoilà!\r\n\r\n_March_ 7.\r\n\r\nIf I die I should like to be buried in the cherry orchards at V----.\r\n\r\nHow the beastly mob loves a tragedy! The sudden death of the Bank\r\nManager is simply thrilling the town, and the newspapers sell like hot\r\ncakes. Scarcely before the body is cold the coincidence of his death on\r\nthe anniversary of his birth is discussed in every household; every one\r\ntells everybody else where they saw him last \"he looked all right then.\"\r\nThe policeman and the housemaid, the Mayor and the Town Clerk, the\r\ncabman and the billposter, stand and discuss the deceased gentleman's\r\nlast words or what the widow's left with. \"Ah! well, it is very sad,\"\r\nthey remark to one another with no emotion and continue on their way.\r\n\r\n_March_ 10.\r\n\r\nOn coming downstairs in the evening played Ludo with H----. At one stage\r\nI laughed so much in conjunction with that harlequin H---- that I got\r\ncramp in the abdominal muscles and the tears trickled down my face.\r\n\r\n_March_ 13.\r\n\r\nH---- and I play Ludo incessantly. We've developed the gambling fever,\r\nand our pent-up excitement every now and then explodes in fiendish\r\ncackles, and Mother looks up over her spectacles and says, \"William,\r\nWilliam, they'll hear in the street presently.\"\r\n\r\n_A Character_\r\n\r\nFor this world's unfortunates, his is the ripe sympathy of a\r\nwell-developed nature, standing in strong contrast with the rest of his\r\npersonality, which is wholly self-centred, a little ungenerous, and what\r\nstrong men of impeccable character call \"weak.\" If you are ill he is\r\ndelightful, if you are robust or successful he can be very\r\nobjectionable. To an influenza victim he goes out of his way to carry a\r\nbook, but if you tell him with gusto you have passed your exam, he says,\r\n\"Oh, but there's not much behind it, is there?\" \"Oh! no,\" I answer,\r\ncomforting him, \"it is really a misfortune to be a success.\" And so only\r\nthe bankrupts, dipsos (as he calls them), ne'er-do-weels, and sudden\r\ndeaths ever touch his heart or tap his sympathy. He is a short, queery,\r\ndressy little fellow, always spruce and clean. His joy consists in a\r\nglass of beer, a full stomach, a good cigar, or a pretty girl to flirt\r\nwith. He frequents drinking saloons and billiard rooms, goes to dances\r\nand likes to be thought a lady's man. \"Urn,\" he will say, with the air\r\nof a connoisseur, \"a little too broad in the beam,\" as some attractive\r\ndamsel walks down the street. Any day about twelve you can see both of\r\nus, \"the long and the short of it\" (he is only half my height and I call\r\nhim .5), walking together in the Park, and engaged in the most heated\r\ndiscussion over some entirely trivial matter, such as whether he would\r\nmarry a woman with sore eyes, etc., etc. More than once we have caught\r\ncabmen idle on the cab-rank or policemen on point duty jerking their\r\nthumbs backward at us and expressing some facetious remarks which we\r\nlonged to overhear. I usually walk in the gutter to bring my height down\r\na bit.\r\n\r\nA good raconteur himself, he does not willingly suffer a story from\r\nanother. The varmint on occasion finishes your joke off for you, which\r\nis his delicate way of intimating that he has heard it before. He is a\r\nfirst-class mimic, and sends every one into a thousand fits while he\r\ngives you in succession the Mayor and all the Corporation. He also\r\ndelights me at times by mimicking me. His mind is receptive rather than\r\ncreative: it picks up all sorts of gaudy ideas by the wayside like a\r\nmagpie, and I sometimes enjoy the exquisite sensation of hearing some of\r\nthese petty pilferings (which he has filched from me) laid at my feet as\r\nif they were his own. The ideas which are his own are always\r\nunmistakable.\r\n\r\nHis favourite poems are Omar and the Ballad of Reading Jail, his\r\nfavourite drinks Medoc or a Cherry Mixture. Me he describes as\r\n_serpentilous_ with _Gibbon-like arms,_ pinheaded, and so on. He amuses\r\nme. In fact I love him.\r\n\r\n_March_ 16.\r\n\r\nNo one will ever understand without personal experience that an\r\nexceedingly self-conscious creature like myself driven in on himself to\r\nconsume himself is the unhappiest of men. I have come to loathe myself:\r\nmy finicking, hypersensitive, morbid nature, always thinking, talking,\r\nwriting about myself for all the world as if the world beyond did not\r\nexist! I am rings within rings, circles concentric and intersecting, a\r\nmaze, a tangle: watching myself behave or misbehave, always reflecting\r\non what impression I am making on others or what they think of me.\r\nIntroduce me to a stranger and I swell out as big as Alice.\r\nSelf-consciousness makes me pneumatic, and consequently so awkward and\r\nclumsy and swollen that I don't know how to converse--and God help the\r\nother fellow.\r\n\r\n_Later_: Youth is an intoxication without wine, some one says. Life is\r\nan intoxication. The only sober man is the melancholiac, who,\r\ndisenchanted, looks at life, sees it as it really is, and cuts his\r\nthroat. If this be so, I want to be very drunk. The great thing is to\r\nlive, to clutch at our existence and race away with it in some great\r\nand enthralling pursuit. Above all, I must beware of all ultimate\r\nquestions--they are too maddeningly unanswerable--let me eschew\r\nphilosophy and burn Omar.\r\n\r\nIn this week's _T.P.'s Weekly_ a youth advertises:--\"Young thinkers\r\ninterested in philosophy, religion, social reform, the future of\r\nhumanity, and all freethought, please communicate with 'Evolution,' aged\r\n21!\" All right for 21.\r\n\r\n_Later_: I have in mind some work on the vascular system of larval\r\nnewts. In the autumn I see a large piece of work to be done in animal\r\npsychology--namely, frequency of stimulus and its relation to habit\r\nformation. Yet the doctor advises long rest and the office work remains\r\nto be done. I must hack my way through somehow. I sit trying to\r\ndisentangle these knots; then some one plays a dreamy waltz and all my\r\nfine edifices of the will vanish in mist. Is it worth while? Why not\r\nfloat with the tide? But I soon throw off these temptations. If I live,\r\nI shall play a fine game! I am determined. A lame-dog life is of no use.\r\n\r\n_April_ 17.\r\n\r\n_Railway Travel_\r\n\r\nA journey in a railway train makes me sentimental. If I enter the\r\ncompartment a robust-minded, cheerful youth, fresh and whistling from a\r\nwalk by the sea, yet, as soon as I am settled down in one corner and the\r\ntrain is rattling along past fields, woods, towns, and painted stations,\r\nI find myself indulging in a saccharine sadness--very toothsome and\r\njolly. I pull a long face and gaze out of the window wistfully and look\r\nsad. But I am really happy--and incredibly sentimental.\r\n\r\nThe effect is produced, I suppose, by the quickly changing panoramic\r\nview of the country, and as I see everything sliding swiftly by, and\r\nfeel myself being hurtled forward willy-nilly, I am sub-conscious of the\r\nflight of Time, of the eternal flux, of the trajectory of my own\r\nlife.... Timid folk, of course, want some Rock of Ages, something\r\nstatic. They want life a mill pond rather than the torrent which it is,\r\na homely affair of teacups and tabby cats rather than a dangerous\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n_April_ 22.\r\n\r\nWho will rid me of the body of this death? My body is chained to me--a\r\ndead weight. It is my warder. I can do nothing without first consulting\r\nit and seeking its permission. I jeer at its grotesqueness. I chafe at\r\nthe thongs it binds on me. On this bully I am dependent for everything\r\nthe world can give me. How can I preserve my _amour propre_ when I must\r\nneeds be for ever wheedling and cajoling a despot with delicate meats\r\nand soft couches?--I who am proud, ambitious, and full of energy! In the\r\nend, too, I know it intends to carry me off.... I should like though to\r\nhave the last kick and, copying De Quincey, arrange to hand it over for\r\ndissection to the medical men--out of revenge.\r\n\r\n\"Hope thou not much; fear thou not at all\"--my motto of late.\r\n\r\n_April_ 30.\r\n\r\nI can well imagine looking back on these entries later on and blushing\r\nat the pettiness of my soul herein revealed.... Only be charitable, kind\r\nreader. There are three Johns, and I am much mistaken if in these pages\r\nthere will not be found something of the John known to himself, and an\r\ninkling, perhaps, of the man as he is known to his Creator. As a timid\r\nshowman afraid that unless he emphasises the feature of his exhibit,\r\nthey will be overlooked, let me, hat in hand, point out that I know I am\r\nan ass, that I am still hoping (in spite of ill health) that I am an\r\nenthusiast.\r\n\r\n_May_ 2.\r\n\r\nMaeterlinck's _Wisdom and Destiny_ is distilled Marcus Aurelius. I am\r\nrather tired of these comfortable philosophers. If a man be harassed by\r\nFate with a red rag and a picador let him turn and rend him--or try to,\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n_May_ 8.\r\n\r\n_Staying by the Sea_\r\n\r\nI have been living out of doors a lot lately and am getting sunburnt. It\r\ngives me infinite pleasure to be sunburnt--to appear the man of the open\r\nair, the open road, and the wild life. The sun intoxicates me to-day.\r\nThe sea is not big enough to hold me nor the sky for me to breathe in. I\r\nfeel I should like to be swaying with all the passions, throbbing with\r\nlife and a vast activity of heart and sinew--to live magnificently--with\r\nan unquenchable thirst to drink to the lees, to plumb the depth of every\r\njoy and every sorrow, to see my life flash in the heat. Ah! Youth!\r\nYouth! Youth!!! In these moments of ecstasy my happiness is torrential.\r\nI have the soul of the poppy flaming in me then. I am rather like the\r\npoppy in many ways.... It is peculiarly appropriate. It must be my\r\nflower! I am the poppy!!\r\n\r\n_May_ 9.\r\n\r\nL---- was digging up the ground in his garden to-day and one shovelful\r\ncame up thick and shapely. He laid the sod on its back gently without\r\nbreaking it and said simply, \"Doesn't it come up nice?\" His face was\r\nradiant!--Real happiness lies in the little things, in a bit of garden\r\nwork, in the rattle of the teacups in the next room, in the last chapter\r\nof a book.\r\n\r\n_May_ 14.\r\n\r\nReturned home. I hate living in this little town. If some one dies, he\r\nis sure to be some one you had a joke with the night before. A\r\nsuicide--ten to one--implicates your bosom friend, or else the little\r\nman at the bookshop cut him down. There have been three deaths since I\r\ncame home--I knew them all. It depresses me. The town seems a mortuary\r\nwith all these dead bodies lying in it. Lucky for you, if you're a fat,\r\nrubicund, unimaginative physician.\r\n\r\n_May_ 16.\r\n\r\nTwo more people dead--one a school friend. Sat on a seat on the river\r\nbank and read the _Journal of Animal Behaviour_. It made me long to be\r\nat work. I foamed at the mouth to be sitting there perforce in an\r\novercoat on a seat doing nothing like a pet dove. A weak heart makes\r\ncrossing a road an adventure and turns each day into a dangerous\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n_May_ 18.\r\n\r\nA dirty ragamuffin on the river's bank held up a tin can to me with the\r\nsoftly persuasive words,--\r\n\r\n\"'Ere, Mister, BAIT.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Salmon.\"\r\n\r\nWe have all tried to catch salmon with a bent pin. No matter though if\r\nno salmon be caught. Richard Jefferies said, \"If there be no immortality\r\nstill we shall have had the glory of that thought.\"\r\n\r\n_May_ 19.\r\n\r\n_Old Diaries_\r\n\r\nSpent some happy time reading over old diaries. I was grieved and\r\nsurprised to find how much I had forgotten. To forget the past so easily\r\nseems scarcely loyal to oneself. I am so selfishly absorbed in my\r\npresent self that I have grown not to care a damn about that ever\r\nincreasing collection of past selves--those dear, dead gentlemen who one\r\nafter the other have tenanted the temple of this flesh and handed on the\r\ntorch of my life and personal identity before creeping away silently and\r\nmodestly to rest.\r\n\r\n_June_ 6.\r\n\r\nBrilliantly fine and warm. Unable to resist the sun, so I caught the ten\r\ntrain to S---- and walked across the meadow (buttercups,\r\nforget-me-nots, ragged robins) to the Dipper stream and the ivy bridge.\r\nRead ardently in Geology till twelve. Then took off my boots and socks,\r\nand waded underneath the right arch of the bridge in deep water, and\r\neventually sat on a dry stone at the top of the masonry just where the\r\nwater drops into the green salmon pool in a solid bar. Next I waded\r\nupstream to a big slab of rock tilted at a comfortable angle. I lay flat\r\non this with my nether extremities in water up to my knees. The sun\r\nbathed my face and dragon flies chased up and down intent on murder. But\r\nI cared not a tinker's Demetrius about Nature red in tooth and claw. I\r\nwas quite satisfied with Nature under a June sun in the cool atmosphere\r\nof a Dipper stream. I lay on the slab completely relaxed, and the cool\r\nwater ran strongly between my toes. Surely I was never again going to be\r\nmiserable. The voices of children playing in the wood made me extra\r\nhappy. As a rule I loathe children. I am too much of a youth still. But\r\nnot this morning. For these were fairy voices ringing through enchanted\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n_June_ 8.\r\n\r\nBrilliantly fine and warm. Went by train to C---- Woods. Took\r\nfirst-class return on account of the heat. Crossed the meadow and up the\r\nhill to the mill leat, where we bathed our feet and read. Ate a powerful\r\nlunch and made several unsuccessful grabs at Caddie flies. I want one to\r\nexamine the mouth parts. After lunch we sat on the foot-bridge over the\r\nstream, and I rested on it flat in the face of the sun. The sun seemed\r\nto burn into my very bones, purging away everything that may be dark or\r\nthreatening there. The physical sensation of the blood flow beneath the\r\nskin was good to feel, and the heat made every tissue glow with a\r\nradiant well-being. When I got up and opened my eyes all the colours of\r\nthe landscape vanished under the silvery whiteness of the intense\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nWe put on our boots and socks (our feet seemed to have swollen to a very\r\nlarge size) and wandered downstream to a little white house, a\r\ngamekeeper's cottage, where the old woman gave us cream and milk and\r\nhome-made bread in her beautiful old kitchen with open hearth. China\r\ndogs, of course, and on the wall an old painting representing the person\r\nof a page boy (so she said) who was once employed up at the squire's. An\r\nunwholesome atmosphere of pigs pervaded the garden, but as this is not\r\npretty I ought to leave it out....\r\n\r\n_June_ 14.\r\n\r\nBrilliantly fine. Went by the early train to S----. Walked to the ivy\r\nbridge and then waded upstream to the great slab of rock where I spread\r\nmyself in the sun as before. The experiment was so delightful it is\r\nworth repeating a hundred times. In this position I read of the decline\r\nand fall of Trilobites, of the Stratigraphy of the Lias and so on.\r\nGeology is a very crushing science, yet I enjoyed my existence this\r\nmorning with the other flies about that stream.\r\n\r\n_June_ 20.\r\n\r\nSat at Liverpool University for the practical exam. Zoology, Board of\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\nAt the close the other students left but I went on working. Prof.\r\nHerdman asked me if I had finished. I said \"No,\" so he gave me a little\r\nmore time. Later he came up again, and again I said \"No,\" but he replied\r\nthat he was afraid I must stop. \"What could you do further?\" he asked,\r\npicking up a dish of plankton. I pointed out a _Sagitta_, an\r\n_Oikopleura_, and a _Noctiluca_, and he replied, \"Of course I put in\r\nmore than you were expected to identify in the time, so as to make a\r\nchoice possible.\" Then he complimented me on my written papers which\r\nwere sent in some weeks ago, and looking at my practical work he added,\r\n\"And this, too, seems to be quite excellent.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him from the bottom of a greedy and grateful heart, and he\r\nwent on, \"I see you describe yourself in your papers as a journalist,\r\nbut can you tell me exactly what has been your career in Zoology?\" I\r\nanswered of course rather proudly that I had had _no_ career in Zoology.\r\n\r\n\"But what school or college have you worked at?\" he persisted.\r\n\r\n\"None,\" I said a little doggedly. \"What I know I have taught myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you've had no training in Zoology at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you've taught yourself all you know, you've done remarkably\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nHe still seemed a little incredulous, and when I explained how I got a\r\ngreat many of my marine animals for dissection and study at the Plymouth\r\nMarine Laboratory, he immediately asked me suspiciously if I had ever\r\nworked there. We shook hands, and he wished me all success in the\r\nfuture, to which I to myself devoutly said Amen.\r\n\r\nCame home very elated at having impressed some one at last.\r\n\r\nNow for Dublin.\r\n\r\n_June_ 30.\r\n\r\nOeconomic biology may be very useful but I am not interested in it. Give\r\nme the pure science. I don't want to be worrying my head over remedies\r\nfor potato disease nor cures for fleas in fowls. Heaven preserve me from\r\never becoming a County Council lecturer or a Government\r\nEntomologist![1]... Give me the recluse life of a scholar or\r\ninvestigator, full of leisure, culture, and delicate skill. I would\r\nrather know Bergson than be able to stay at the Ritz Hotel. I would\r\nrather be able to dissect a star-fish's water-vascular system than know\r\nthe price of Consols. I should make a most industrious country gentleman\r\nwith £5,000 a year and a deer park.... My idea is to withdraw from the\r\n_mobile vulgus_ and spend laborious days in the library or laboratory.\r\nThe world is too much with us. I long for the monotony of monastic life!\r\nFather Wasmann and the Abbé Spallanzani are the type. Let me set my\r\nface towards them. Such lives afford poor material for novelists or\r\ndramatists, but so much the better. Hamlet makes fine reading, but I\r\ndon't want to be Hamlet myself.\r\n\r\n_July_ 6.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon went out dredging in fifteen fathoms off the pier at\r\nI----, but without much success.... Got a large number of interesting\r\nthings, however, in the tow net, including some advanced eggs of\r\n_Loligo_ and a _Tomopteris_....\r\n\r\n_July_ 7.\r\n\r\nWent to the trout stream again. After stretching a muslin net crosswise\r\non the water for insects floating down, sat on the footbridge and read\r\nGeology for the Dublin Examination. Later, waded downstream to a hazel\r\nbush on the right bank beneath a shady oak. Squatted right down on the\r\nbush, which supported me like an arm-chair--and, with legs dangling in\r\nthe cool water, opened a Meredith and enjoyed myself.\r\n\r\n_July_ 28.\r\n\r\nHad to write backing out of the Dublin Examination for which I am\r\nnominated to sit. I am simply not fit for the racket of such a journey\r\nin my present state of health. My chances of success, too, are not such\r\nas to warrant my drawing on Dad for the money. He is still ill, and\r\nsecretly agitated, I fear, because I am so bent on giving up his work.\r\nIt looks, however, as if newspaper journalism is to be my fate. It was\r\nthe refinement of torture having to write.\r\n\r\n_July_ 31.\r\n\r\nHad a letter from Dr. S---- enough to wring tears from a monument.\r\n\r\nSat like a valetudinarian in the Park all day getting fresh air--among\r\nthe imbeciles, invalids, and children. Who cares? \"But, gentlemen, you\r\n_shall_ hear.\"\r\n\r\n_August_ 4.\r\n\r\nStill another chance--quite unexpectedly received a second nomination\r\nthis morning to sit for another exam, for two vacancies in the British\r\nMuseum. Good luck this.\r\n\r\n_August_ 11.\r\n\r\nVery hot, so went to S----, and bathed in the salmon pool. Stretched\r\nmyself out in the water, delighted to find that I had at last got to the\r\nvery heart of the countryside. I was not just watching from the\r\noutside--on the bank. I was in it, and plunging in it, too, up to my\r\narmpits. What did I care about the British Museum or Zoology then? All\r\nbut the last enemy and object of conquest I had overcome--for the moment\r\nperhaps even Death himself was under heel--I was immortal--in that\r\nminute I was always prostrate in the stream--sunk deep in the bosom of\r\nold Mother Earth who cannot die!\r\n\r\n_August_ 14.\r\n\r\nAt 4 p.m. to the Salmon Pool for a bathe. 87.3 in the shade. The meadow\r\nwas delicious in the sunshine. It made me want to hop, flirt my tail,\r\nsing. I felt ever such a bright-eyed wily bird!\r\n\r\n_August_ 17.\r\n\r\nCaught the afternoon train to C----, but unfortunately forgot to take\r\nwith me either watch or tubes (for insects). So I applied to the\r\nstation-master, a youth of about eighteen, who is also signalman,\r\nporter, ticket-collector, and indeed very factotal--even to the extent\r\nof providing me with empty match boxes. I agreed with him to be called\r\nby three halloos from the viaduct just before the evening train came in.\r\nThen I went up to the leat, set up my muslin net in it for insects\r\nfloating down, and then went across to the stream and bathed.\r\nAfterwards, went back and boxed the insects caught, and returned to the\r\nlittle station, with its creepers on the walls and over the roof, all\r\nas delightfully quiet as ever, and the station youth as delightfully\r\nsilly. Then the little train came around the bend of the line--green\r\npuffing engine and red coaches, like a crawling caterpillar of gay\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n_August_ 20.\r\n\r\nA trapper killed a specimen of _Tropidonotus natrix_ and brought it to\r\nme. I gave him sixpence for it and am just going to dissect it.\r\n\r\n_August_ 21.\r\n\r\nThere are folk who notice nothing. (Witness Capt. McWhirr in Conrad's\r\n_Typhoon_.) They live side by side with genius or tragedy as innocent as\r\nbabies; there are heaps of people who live on a mountain, a volcano,\r\neven, without knowing it. If the stars of Heaven fell and the Moon were\r\nturned into blood some one would have to direct their attention to\r\nit.... Perhaps after all, the most obvious things are the most difficult\r\nto see. We all recognise Keats now, but suppose he was only \"the boy\r\nnext door\"--why should I read his verses?\r\n\r\n_August_ 27.\r\n\r\n_Preparing a Snake's Skull_\r\n\r\nPrepared the skull of grass snake. I fancy I scooped out the eyes with\r\npatent delight--I suppose symbolically, as though, on behalf of the rest\r\nof suffering humanity, I were wiping off the old score against the beast\r\nfor its behaviour in the Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\n_September_ 5.\r\n\r\nAt 2.30 Dad had three separate \"strokes\" of paralysis in as many\r\nminutes, the third leaving him helpless. They sent for me in the\r\nLibrary, where I was reading, and I hurried home. Just as I entered the\r\nbedroom where he and Mother were another attack came on, and it was with\r\nthe utmost difficulty that with her help I managed to get him from the\r\nchair to the bed. He struggled with his left arm and leg and made\r\ninarticulate noises which sounded as if they might be groans. I don't\r\nknow if he was in pain. Dear Mother.\r\n\r\n_September_ 14.\r\n\r\nDad cannot live long. Mother bears up wonderfully well. Tried to do some\r\nexamination work but failed utterly. A---- is watching in the sick-room\r\nwith Mother who will not leave.\r\n\r\n8.30. The nurse says he will not live through the night.\r\n\r\n8.45. Telegraphed for A---- to come.\r\n\r\n11.00. A---- came downstairs and had a little supper.\r\n\r\n12.00. Went to bed. H---- and the others lit a fire and we have all sat\r\naround it silent, listening to its murmur. Every one felt cold. Dad has\r\nbeen unconscious for over an hour.\r\n\r\n1.45 a.m. Heard a noise, then heard Mother coming downstairs past my\r\nbedroom door with some one--sobbing. I knew it must be all over.\r\nH----was helping her down. Waited in my bedroom in the dark for three\r\nparts of an hour, when H---- came up, opened the door slowly and said,\r\n\"He's gone, old man.\" It was a tremendous relief to know that since he\r\nhad to die his sufferings and cruel plight were over. Fell asleep from\r\nsheer exhaustion and slept soundly.\r\n\r\n_September_ 18.\r\n\r\nThe funeral. _It is not death but the dreadful possibilities of life\r\nwhich are so depressing_.[2]\r\n\r\n_September_ 21.\r\n\r\n_A Day in Autumn_\r\n\r\nA cool, breezy autumn day. The beach was covered with patches of soapy\r\nfoam that shook tremulously in the wind--all the rocks and everything\r\nwere drenched with water, and the spray came off the breaking waves like\r\nsteam. A red sun went lower and lower and the shadows cast by the rocks\r\ngrew very long and grotesque. Underneath the breaking waves, the hollows\r\nwere green and dark like sea caverns. Herring gulls played about in the\r\nair balancing themselves as they faced the breeze, then sweeping\r\nsuddenly around and downwards with the wind behind them. We all sat down\r\non the rocks and were very quiet, almost monosyllabic. We pointed out a\r\npassing vessel to one another or chucked a bit of shingle into the sea.\r\nYou would have said we were bored. Yet deep down in ourselves we were\r\nastir and all around us we could hear the rumours of divine passage,\r\nsoft and mysterious as the flight of birds migrating in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe wind rose and tapped the line against the flag-staff at the\r\nCoastguard Station. It roared through my hair and past my ears for an\r\nhour on end till I felt quite windswept and bleak. On the way home we\r\nsaw the wind darting hither and thither over the long grass like a\r\nlunatic snake. The wind! Oh! the wind--I have an enormous faith in the\r\ncurative properties of the wind. I feel better already.\r\n\r\n_October_ 17.\r\n\r\nStaying in Surrey. Exam. over and I feel fairly confident--after an\r\nagony for a few days before on account of the development of a cold\r\nwhich threatened to snatch the last chance out of my hands.\r\n\r\n_Justifiable Mendacity_\r\n\r\nSitting on a gate on the N. Downs I saw a long way below me in the\r\nvalley a man standing in a chalk pit and wielding a stick vigorously.\r\nFor some reason or another the idea came to me that it would be\r\ninteresting if he were in the act of killing a Snake--he so far away\r\nbelow and I above and unnoticed quietly watching him. At dinner\r\nto-night, this revised version of the story came out quite pat and\r\nnatural and obviously interested the assembly. I added graphically that\r\nthe man was too far away from me to be able to say what _species_ of\r\nSnake it was he was killing. I possess the qualifications of an\r\nartistic liar. Yet I can't regard such a story as a lie--it was rather a\r\njustifiable emendation of an otherwise uninteresting incident.\r\n\r\n_October_ 24.\r\n\r\n_Une Caractère_\r\n\r\n... She is a tiny little old lady, very frail and very delicate, with a\r\ntiny voice like the noise of a fretsaw. She talks incessantly about\r\nthings which do not interest you, until your face gets stiff with\r\nforcing a polite smile, and your voice cracked and your throat dry with\r\nsaying, \"Yes,\" and \"Really.\"\r\n\r\nTo-night I attend the Zoological Society to read my first paper, so I am\r\nreally in a fluster and want to be quiet. Therefore to prevent her from\r\ntalking I write two letters which I represent as urgent. At 6.15\r\ndesperate, so went out for a walk in the dark London streets. Returned\r\nto supper and to Her. After the wife, the husband is intellectual\r\npyrotechnics. Referring to the Museum,--\r\n\r\n\"Would you have there, I suppose, any insects, in a case like, what you\r\nmight say to study to yourself when no one is by?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n6.40. It is now one hour before I need leave for the meeting, and\r\nwhether I sigh, cough, smoke, or read the paper, she goes on. She even\r\nrefuses to allow me to scan the lines below photos in the _Illustrated\r\nLondon News._ I write this as the last sole resource to escape her\r\ndevastating prattle and the ceaseless hum of her tiny gnat-like mind.\r\nShe thinks (because I told her so) that I am preparing notes for the\r\nevening meeting.\r\n\r\n_Later_: Spent an absolutely damnable day. Am sick, tired, bored,\r\nfrantic with her voice which I have been able to share with no one\r\nexcept the intellectual giant, her husband, at tea time. In order to\r\nbreak the flow of chatter, I would rudely interrupt and go on talking,\r\nby this means keeping my end up for as long as I could, and enjoying a\r\nshort respite from the fret-sawing voice. But I tired of this and it was\r\nof no permanent value. When I broke in, she still went on for a few\r\nsentences unable to stop, and lo! here was the spectacle of two persons\r\nalone together in a room both talking at the same time and neither\r\nlistening. I persisted though--and she had to stop. Once started, I was\r\nafraid to stop--scared at the certain fact of the voice beginning to saw\r\nagain. After a while the fountain of my artificial garrulity dried up,\r\nand the Voice at once leaped into the breach, resuming--amazing and\r\nincredible as it seems--at the precise point where it had left off. At 7\r\nI am quite exhausted and sit on the opposite side of the hearth, staring\r\nwith glassy eyes, arms drooping at my sides and mouth druling. At 7.05\r\nher cough increases, and she has to stop to attend to it. With a\r\nfiendish smile I push back my chair, and quietly watch her cough.... She\r\ncoughs continuously now and can talk no longer. Thank God! 8 p.m., left\r\nfor the meeting, where I read my paper in a state of awful\r\nnervousness.... I read out all I had to say and kept them amused for\r\nabout ten minutes. I was very excited when Dr. ---- got up and praised\r\nthe paper,[3] saying it was interesting, and hoping I should continue\r\nthe experiments. The chairman, Sir John Rose Bradford, asked a question,\r\nI answered it and then sat down. After the meeting we went upstairs to\r\nthe library, had tea and chatted with some of the big people.... Zoology\r\nis certainly delightful, yet it seems to me the Zoologists are much as\r\nother people. I like Zoology. I wish I could do without Zoologists....\r\n\r\n_October_ 30.\r\n\r\nHome once more. The Natural History Museum impressed me enormously. It\r\nis a magnificent building--too magnificent to work there--to follow\r\none's profession in a building like that seems an altogether too\r\ngrandiose manner of life. A pious zoologist might go up to pray in\r\nit--but not to earn his daily bread there.\r\n\r\n_October_ 31.\r\n\r\nI'm in, in, in!!!!!!!!! being first with 141 marks to spare. Old\r\nM----[the servant] rushes up to my sister's bedroom with the news just\r\nafter 7 a.m., and she says, \"Fine, fine,\" and comes down in her\r\nnightgown to my bedroom, where we drink our morning cup of tea\r\ntogether--and talk! I'm delighted. What a magnificent obstacle race it\r\nhas been! Still one ditch--the medical exam! Wired to friends.\r\n\r\n_November_ 1.\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of letter which is balm to me:--\"My darling W----,--I\r\nneed hardly tell you how absolutely delighted we were at the grand news\r\nof this morning. You must be feeling a huge glow of satisfaction with\r\nthe knowledge of your object attained through untold difficulties. I\r\ndon't wish to butter you up, or to gush, but I must honestly say that I\r\nfeel tip-top proud of my old Beano. I admire your brains more than ever,\r\nand also your indomitable pluck and grit, and your quiet bravery in\r\ndisappointment and difficulty....\"\r\n\r\n_November_ 14.\r\n\r\nThe three most fascinating books in Science that I have so far read are\r\n(easily):--1. Darwin's _Expression of the Emotions_. 2. Gaskell's\r\n_Origin of Vertebrates_. 3. Bergson's _Le Rire_.\r\n\r\nWent to the dentist in the afternoon. Evening chiefly occupied in\r\nreading _Le Rire_. By my halidom, it is an extraordinarily interesting\r\nbook!\r\n\r\n_November_ 29.\r\n\r\n... I am always looking out for new friends--assaying for friendship....\r\nThere is no more delightful adventure than an expedition into a rich,\r\nmany-sided personality. Gradually over a long probation--for deep minds\r\nare naturally reticent--piece after piece is added to the geography of\r\nyour friend's mind, and each piece pleases or entertains, while in\r\nreturn you let him steal away piece after piece of your own territory,\r\nperhaps saving a bit up here and there--such as an enthusiasm for\r\nFrancis Thompson's poetry--and then letting it go unexpectedly. It's a\r\ndelightful reciprocity.\r\n\r\nI dream of \"the honeyed ease of the Civil Servant's working day\"\r\n(Peacock). Yet the French say _Songes sont mensonges_.\r\n\r\n_December_ 13.\r\n\r\nIn the Park it was very dark and she said,--\r\n\r\n\"If I lose you I shan't be able to find my way home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I'll look after you,\" I said.\r\n\r\nBoth being of the same mind at the same time we sat down on a seat\r\ntogether when a fortunate thing happened. It began to rain. So I offered\r\nher part of my overcoat. She nestled in under my arm and I kissed her\r\nout of hand. _Voilà_! A very pretty little girl, 'pon my word.\r\n\r\n_December_ 20.\r\n\r\nThe thing is obsessing me. After an early supper called and found my\r\nlady ready to receive me. No one else at home. So walked into the\r\noak-panelled room with the red-curtained windows, took off my coat and\r\nscarf. She followed and switched off the light. There was a roaring fire\r\nin the grate. She is very amorous and I am not Hippolytus, so we were\r\nsoon closely engaged in the large chair before the fire. As we sailed\r\nthus, close hauled to the wind, with double entendres and she trembled\r\nin the storm (and I was at the helm) the garden gate slammed and both of\r\nus got up quickly. I next heard a key turn in the lock and a foot in the\r\npassage: \"Mr. ----\" she said....\r\n\r\nShe switched on the light, went out swiftly into the passage, and\r\nmeeting him conducted him to her office, while I as swiftly put on\r\novercoat and scarf, and slipped out through the open door, stumbling\r\nover his bicycle, but of course not stopping to pick it up. Later she\r\ntelephoned to say it was all right. Very relieved!... She recalls\r\nRichepin's _La Glu_.\r\n\r\n_December_ 21.\r\n\r\nShe is a fine sedative. Her movements are a pleasant adagio, her voice\r\npiano to pianissimo, her conversation breaks off in thrilling\r\naposiopoeses.\r\n\r\nAn awful comedy this morning--for as soon as I was securely \"gagged\" the\r\ndentist went out of the room. She approached, leered at me helpless, and\r\nsaid provokingly, \"Oh! you do look funny.\" Minx. On returning he said to\r\nher, \"Would you like to hold his hand?\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"Oh! not just now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they grinned at one another and at me waiting to be tortured.\r\n\r\n_December_ 23.\r\n\r\n... On the Station waited for an hour for the train. Gave her a box of\r\nsweets and the _Bystander_. We walked up the platform to extreme end in\r\nthe dark and kissed! But it was very windy and cold. (I noticed that!)\r\nSo we entered an empty luggage guard's van on rail beside platform left\r\nthere by shunters. Here we were out of the wind and far better off. But\r\na shunter came along and turned us out. She gave me a silver match-box.\r\nBut I believe for various reasons that it is one of her own and not a\r\nnew one. Said \"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n_December_ 28.\r\n\r\nAt R----. Played the negligent _flaneur_, reclining on the Chesterfield,\r\nleaning against the grand piano, or measuring my length on the mat\r\nbefore the fire.\r\n\r\n_December_ 31.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow I begin duties at the British Museum of Natural History. I\r\ncannot quite imagine myself a Museum assistant. Before I get there I\r\nknow I shall be the strangest assistant on the staff. It will be\r\nsinging my song in a Strange land and weeping--I hope not too\r\nbitterly--down by the waters of a very queer Babylon.\r\n\r\nStill, I have burnt my bridges like Cæsar--or burnt my ships like\r\nCortez. So forward!\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See entry for October 8, 1913.\r\n\r\n[2] Italics added 1917.\r\n\r\n[3] The paper was \"Distant Orientation in Batrachia\"--detailing\r\nexperiments on the homing faculty in newts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II--IN LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1912\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 21.\r\n\r\nAm at last beginning to get more content with the work at the Museum, so\r\nthat I muse on Bernard Shaw's saying, \"Get what you like or you'll grow\r\nto like what you get.\" I have a terrible suspicion that the security of\r\ntenure here is like the lion's den in the fable--_Nulla vestiga\r\nretrorsum_. Of course I am wonderfully proud of being at the Museum,\r\nalthough I am disappointed and write as if I were quite blasé.\r\n\r\n_January_ 25.\r\n\r\nI should be disappointed if at the end of my career (if I live to see it\r\nthrough) I do not win the F.R.S. I should very much like it.... My\r\nnature is very mixed--ambitious above all things and yet soon giddy with\r\nthe audacity of my aspirations. The B.M. and my colleagues make me feel\r\nmost inferior in fact, but in theory--in the secrecy of my own\r\nbedchamber--I feel that there are few men there my equal.\r\n\r\n_April_ 26.\r\n\r\nDown with influenza. A boarding-house with the 'flue!\r\n\r\n_May_ 8.\r\n\r\nWent home to recuperate, a beef jelly in one pocket and sal volatile in\r\nthe other. On arrival, my blanched appearance frightened Mother and the\r\nothers, so went to bed at once. \"Fate's a fiddler, life's a dance.\"\r\n\r\n_May_ 12.\r\n\r\nWeak enough to sit down before dressing-table while I shave and brush my\r\nhair. Dyspepsia appalling. The Doctor in Kensington seemed to think me\r\nan awful wreck and asked if I were concealing----\r\n\r\nReading Baudelaire and Verlaine.\r\n\r\n_May_ 24.\r\n\r\n_Bathing_\r\n\r\nSat on a seat overlooking the sand-hills with stick between my legs like\r\nan old man, and watched a buxom wench aet. 25 run down the path pursued\r\nby \"Rough\" and two little girls in blue. Later they emerged from a\r\nstriped bathing tent in the glory of blue bathing dresses. It made me\r\nfeel quite an old man to see the girl galloping out over the hard level\r\nsands to the breakers, a child clinging to each hand. Legs and arms\r\ntwinkled in the sun which shone with brilliance. If life were as level\r\nas those sands and as beautiful as that trio of girls!\r\n\r\n_May_ 26.\r\n\r\n_Two Young Men Talking_\r\n\r\nWith H---- in his garden. He is a great enthusiast.\r\n\r\n\"I disapprove entirely of your taste in gardening,\" I said. \"You object\r\nto the 'ragged wilderness' style, I like it. You like lawns laid out for\r\ncroquet and your privet hedges pruned into 'God Save the King' or 'Dieu\r\net mon droit.' My dear boy, if you saw Mr. ----'s wilderness at\r\n----you'd be so shocked you'd cut and run, and I imagine there'd be an\r\naffecting reunion between you and your beloved geraniums. For my part, I\r\ndon't like geraniums: they're suburban, and all of a piece with\r\nantimacassars and stuffed birds under glass bells. The colour of your\r\nspecimens, moreover,\" I rapped out, \"is vulgar--like the muddied\r\npetticoats of old market women.\"\r\n\r\nH----, quite unmoved, replied slowly, \"Well, here are some like the\r\nbeautiful white cambric of a lady of fashion. You've got no taste in\r\nflowers--you're just six feet of grief and patience.\" We roared with\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"Do stop watering those damned plants,\" I exclaimed at last. But he\r\nwent on. I exclaimed again and out of sheer ridiculousness, in reply he\r\nproceeded to water the cabbages, the gravel path, the oak tree--and me!\r\nWhile I writhed with laughing.\r\n\r\n_May_ 27.\r\n\r\n_By the Sea_\r\n\r\nSat upon a comfortable jetty of rock and watched the waves without a\r\nglimmer of an idea in my mind about anything--though to outward view I\r\nmight have been a philosopher in cerebral parturition with thoughts as\r\nbig as babies. Instead, little rustling dead leaves of thoughts stirred\r\nand fluttered in the brain--the pimple _e.g._ I recollected on my Aunt's\r\nnose, or the boyishness of Dr. ----'s handwriting, or Swinburne's lines:\r\n\"If the golden-crested wren Were a nightingale--why, then Something seen\r\nand heard of men Might be half as sweet as when Laughs a child of\r\nseven.\"\r\n\r\nI continued in this pleasurable coma all the afternoon and went home\r\nrefreshed.\r\n\r\n_May_ 29.\r\n\r\nHave returned to London and the B.M. My first day at the M. Sat at my\r\ntable in a state of awful apathy.\r\n\r\nAt least temporarily, I am quite disenchanted of Zoology. I work--God\r\nsave the mark--in the Insect Room!\r\n\r\nOn the way home, purchased:--\r\n\r\nPeroxide of hydrogen (pyorrhœa threatened). One bottle of physic (for\r\nmy appalling dyspepsia).\r\n\r\nOne flask of brandy for emergencies (as my heart is intermittent again).\r\n\r\nPrussic acid next.\r\n\r\nMust have been near pneumonia at R----. Auntie was nervous, and came in\r\nduring the night to see how I was.\r\n\r\n_June_ 20.\r\n\r\nIt caused me anguish to see my article returned from the _Fortnightly_\r\nand lying in a big envelope on the table when I returned home this\r\nevening. I can't do any work because of it, and in desperation rushed\r\noff to the stately pleasure domes of the White City, and systematically\r\nwent through all the thrills--from the Mountain Railway to the Wiggle\r\nWoggle and the 'Witching Waves.\r\n\r\n_June_ 21.\r\n\r\nTo-day I am easier. The cut worm forgives the plough. But how restless\r\nthis disappointment has made me.... I have no plans for recuperation and\r\ncannot settle down to work.\r\n\r\n_July_ 6.\r\n\r\nOn my doctor's advice, went to see Dr. P----, a lung specialist.\r\nM----found a dull spot on one of my lungs, and, not feeling very sure,\r\nand without telling me the nature of his suspicion, he arranged for Dr.\r\nP---- to see me, allowing me to suppose he was a stomach authority as my\r\ndyspepsia is bad.\r\n\r\nWell: it is _not_ consumption, but my lungs and physique are such that\r\nconsumption might easily supervene. As soon as Dr. P---- had gone,\r\nM----appended the following lugubrious yarn:--\r\n\r\nWhenever I catch cold, I must go and be treated at once, all my leisure\r\nmust be spent out of doors, I must take cream and milk in prodigious\r\nquantities and get fat at all costs. There is even a question of my\r\ngiving up work.\r\n\r\n_July_ 10.\r\n\r\nA young but fat woman sitting in the sun and oozing moisture is as nasty\r\nas anything in Baudelaire.\r\n\r\n_July_ 14.\r\n\r\n_A \"Brilliant Career\"_\r\n\r\nMy old head master once prophesied for me \"a brilliant career.\" That was\r\nwhen I was in the Third Form. Now I have more than a suspicion that I am\r\none of those who, as he once pointed out, grow sometimes out of a\r\nbrilliant boyhood into very commonplace men. This continuous ill health\r\nis having a very obvious effect on my work and activities. With what\r\ncourage I possess I have to face the fact that to-day I am unable to\r\nthink or express myself as well as when I was a boy in my teens--witness\r\nthis Journal!\r\n\r\nI intend to go on however. I have decided that my death shall be\r\ndisputed all the way.\r\n\r\nOh! it is so humiliating to die! I writhe to think of being overcome by\r\nso unfair an enemy before I have demonstrated myself to maiden aunts who\r\nmistrust me, to colleagues who scorn me, and even to brothers and\r\nsisters who believe in me.\r\n\r\nAs an Egotist I hate death because I should cease to be I.\r\n\r\nMost folk, when sick unto death, gain a little consolation over the\r\nnotoriety gained by the fact of their decease. Criminals enjoy the pomp\r\nand circumstance of their execution. Voltaire said of Rousseau that he\r\nwouldn't mind being hanged if they'd stick his name on the gibbet. But\r\nmy own death would be so mean and insignificant. Guy de Maupassant died\r\nin a grand manner--a man of intellect and splendid physique who became\r\ninsane. Tusitala's death in the South Seas reads like a romance. Heine,\r\nafter a life of sorrow, died with a sparkling witticism on his lips;\r\nVespasian with a jest.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot for the life of me rake up any excitement over my own\r\nimmediate decease--an unobtrusive passing away of a rancorous,\r\ndisappointed, morbid, and self-assertive entomologist in a West\r\nKensington Boarding House--what a mean little tragedy! It is hard not to\r\nbe somebody even in death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA sing-song to-night in the drawing-room; all the boarding-house present\r\nin full muster. There was a German, Schulz, who sat and leered at his\r\ninamorata--a sensual-looking, pasty-faced girl--while she gave us\r\ndaggers-and-moonlight recitations with the most unwarranted\r\nself-assurance (she boasts of a walking-on part at one of the theatres);\r\nthere was Miss M---- listening to her fiancé, Capt. O---- (home from\r\nIndia), singing Indian Love Songs at her; there was Miss T----, a sour\r\nold maid, who knitted and snorted, not fully conscious of this young\r\nblood coursing around her; Mrs. Barclay Woods pursued her usual\r\navocation of imposing on us all the great weight of her immense social\r\nsuperiority, clucking, in between, to her one chick--a fluffy girl of 18\r\nor 19, who was sitting now in the draught, now too close to a \"common\"\r\nmusician of the Covent Garden Opera; finally our hostess, a divorcee,\r\nwho hated all males, even Tom-cats. We were a pathetic little\r\ncompany--so motley, ill-assorted--who had come together not from love or\r\nregard but because man is a gregarious animal. In fact, we sat secretly\r\ncriticising and contemning one another ... yet outside there were so\r\nmany millions of people unknown, and overhead the multitude of the stars\r\nwas equally comfortless.\r\n\r\n_Later_: ... Zoology on occasion still fires my ambition! Surely I\r\ncannot be dying yet.\r\n\r\nWhatever misfortune befalls me I do hope I shall be able to meet it\r\nunflinchingly. I do not fear ill-health in itself, but I do fear its\r\npossible effect on my mind and character.... Already I am slowly\r\naltering, as the Lord liveth. Already for example my sympathy with\r\nmyself is maudlin.\r\n\r\nWhenever the blow shall fall, some sort of a reaction _must_ be given.\r\nHeine flamed into song. Beethoven wrote the 5th Symphony. So what shall\r\nI do when my time comes? I don't think I have any lyrics or symphonies\r\nto write, so I shall just have to grin and bear it--like a dumb\r\nanimal.... As long as I have spirit and buoyancy I don't care what\r\nhappens--for I know that or so long I cannot be accounted a failure. The\r\nonly _real_ failure is one in which the victim is left spiritless,\r\ndazed, dejected with blackness all around, and within, a knife slowly\r\nand unrelentingly cutting the strings of his heart.\r\n\r\nMy head whirls with conflicting emotions, struggling, desperate ideas,\r\nand a flood of impressions of all sorts of things that are never\r\nsufficiently sifted and arranged to be caught down on paper. I am\r\nbrought into this world, hustled along it and then hustled out of it,\r\nwith no time for anything. I want to be on a great hill and square up\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n_August_ 28.\r\n\r\n... After tea, we all three walked in Kensington Gardens and sat on a\r\nseat by the Round Pond. My umbrella fell to the ground, and I left it\r\nthere with its nose poking up in a cynical manner, as She remarked.\r\n\r\n\"It's not cynical,\" I said, \"only a little knowing. Won't you let yours\r\nfall down to keep it company? Yours is a lady umbrella and a\r\ngood-looking one--they might flirt together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine doesn't want to flirt,\" she answered stiffly.\r\n\r\n_September_ 13.\r\n\r\n_At C----, a tiny little village by the sea in N----._\r\n\r\nLooking up from a rockpool, where I had been watching Gobies, I saw\r\nthree children racing across the sands to bathe, I saw a man dive from a\r\nboat, and I saw a horse-man gallop his mare down to the beach and plunge\r\nabout in the line of breakers. The waters thundered, the mare whinnied,\r\nthe children shouted to one another, and I turned my head down again to\r\nthe rockpool with a great thumping heart of happiness: it was so lovely\r\nto be conscious of the fact that out there this beautiful picture was\r\nawaiting me whenever and as often as I chose to lift my head. I\r\npurposely kept my head down, for the picture was so beautiful I did not\r\nwant to hurt it by breathing on it, and I kept my head down out of a\r\nplayful self-cheating delight; I decided not to indulge myself.\r\n\r\n_September_ 16.\r\n\r\nOut in the Bay dredging for Echinoderms with \"Carrots.\" Brilliantly\r\nfine. The haul was a failure, but, being out in a boat on a waveless sea\r\nunder a cloudless sky, I was scarcely depressed at this! We cruised\r\nalong from one little bay to another, past smugglers' caves and white\r\npebble beaches, the dredge all the while growling along the sea bottom,\r\nand \"Carrots\" and I lying listless in the bows. I was _immensely happy_.\r\nMy mercury was positively ringing the bell.\r\n\r\nWho, then, is \"Carrots\"? He is a fine brawny boat-man who jumps over the\r\nrocks like a Chamois, swims like a Fish, pulls like an Ox, snorts like a\r\nGrampus--a sort of compound zoological perfection, built eclectically.\r\n\r\n_September_ 18.\r\n\r\n_Early Boughies_\r\n\r\nUp the village, Mrs. Beavan keeps a tiny little shop and runs a very\r\nlarge garden. She showed us all about the garden, and introduced us to\r\nher husband, whom we discovered in an apple tree--an old man, aged 76,\r\nvery hard of hearing, and with an impediment in his speech. He at once\r\nbegan to move his mouth, and I caught odd jingles of sound that sounded\r\nlike nothing at all--at first, but which gradually resolved themselves\r\non close attention to such familiar landmarks as \"Early Boughies,\"\r\n\"Stubbits,\" \"Ribstone Pippins\" into a discourse on Apples.\r\n\r\nThe following curious conversation took place between me and the deaf\r\ngaffer, aged 76, standing in the apple tree,--\r\n\r\n\"These be all appulls from Kent--I got 'em all from Kent.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you lived in C----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bunyard & Son--that's the firm--they live just outside the town of\r\nMaidstone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you keep Bees here?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of these yer appulls is called Bunyard after the firm--a fine fruit\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your good wife must be of great assistance to you in your work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Little stalks maybe, but a large juishy appull for all that.\"\r\n\r\nJust then I heard Mrs. B---- saying to E----,--\r\n\r\n\"Aw yes, he's very active for 76. A little deaf, but he manages the\r\ngarden all 'eesulf, I bolsters 'un up wi' meat and drink--little and\r\noften as they zay for children.... Now there's a bootifull tree, me\r\ndear, that 'as almost beared itself to death, as you may say.\"\r\n\r\nShe picked an apple off it shouting to poor Tom still aloft,--\r\n\r\n\"Tom what's the name of this one?\"\r\n\r\n\"You should come a bit earlier, zir,\" replied T. \"'Tis late a bit now\r\ndoan't 'ee zee?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--what's its name I want,\" shouted his spouse.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, give the lady one to take home--there's plenty for all,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"What is the NAME? THE NAME OF THIS YER APPULL,\" screamed Mrs. B., and\r\nold Tom moving his bones slowly down from the tree answered quite\r\nunmoved,--\r\n\r\n\"Aw the name? Why, 'tis a common kind of appull--there's a nice tree of\r\n'em up there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! never mind, 'tis a Gladstone,\" said Mrs. B., turning to us.\r\n\r\n\"A very fine Appull,\" droned the old boy.\r\n\r\n_September_ 28.\r\n\r\nBack in town again. Wandered about in a somnambulistic way all the\r\nafternoon till I found myself taking tea in Kew Gardens. I enjoyed the\r\nwind in my face and hair. Otherwise there is nothing to be said--a\r\ncolourless day.\r\n\r\n_October_ 10.\r\n\r\nCame across the following arresting sentence: \"Pale, anæmic, cadaverous,\r\nbad teeth and disordered digestion and a morbid egotism.\" Yes, but my\r\nteeth are _not_ bad.\r\n\r\n_October_ 20.\r\n\r\n_On the N. Downs_\r\n\r\nUnder the oak where I sat the ground was covered with dead leaves. I\r\nkicked them, and I beat them with my stick, because I was angry that\r\nthey were dead. In the coppice, leaves were quietly and majestically\r\nfloating earthwards in the pomp of death. It was very thrilling to\r\nobserve them.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious sensation to realise that since the last time I sat\r\nunder the old oak I had been right up to the N. of England, then right\r\ndown to the S.W., and back once more to London town. I bragged about my\r\nkinetic activity to the stationary oak and I scoffed at the old hill for\r\nhaving to remain always in the same place.\r\n\r\nIt gave me a pleasing sense of infinite superiority to _come back_ and\r\nsee everything the same as before, to sit on the same old seat under the\r\nsame old oak. Even that same old hurdle was lying in the same position\r\namong the bracken. How sorry I was for it! Poor wretch--unable to\r\nmove--to go to Whitby, to go to C----, to be totally ignorant of the\r\ngreat country of London....\r\n\r\nDay dreamed. My own life as it unrolls day by day is a source of\r\nconstant amazement, delight, and pain. I can think of no more\r\ninteresting volume than a detailed, intimate, psychological history of\r\nmy own life. I want a perfect comprehension at least of myself....\r\n\r\nWe are all such egotists that a sorrow or hardship--provided it is great\r\nenough--flatters our self-importance. We feel that a calamity by\r\novertaking us has distinguished us above our fellows. A man likes not to\r\nbe ignored even by a railway accident. A man with a grievance is always\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n_October_ 23.\r\n\r\nOver to see E----. Came away disillusioned.\r\n\r\n_October_ 25.\r\n\r\nMet her in Smith's book shop looking quite bewitching. Hang it all, I\r\nthought I had finished. Went home with her, watched her make a pudding\r\nin the kitchen, then we sat by the firelight in the drawing-room and had\r\nsupper. Scrumptious (not the supper).\r\n\r\n_October_ 27.\r\n\r\nQuarrelled with D----! The atmosphere is changed at the flat--my\r\ncharacter is ruined. D---- has told them I'm a loose fellow. I've always\r\ncontrived to give him that impression--I liked to be cutting my\r\nthroat--and now it's cut!\r\n\r\n_November_ 1.\r\n\r\nD---- came and carried me off to the flat, where they asked why I hadn't\r\nbeen over--which, of course, pleased me immensely.\r\n\r\n_November_ 6.\r\n\r\nDoctor M---- is very gloomy about my health and talks of S. Africa,\r\nLabrador, and so on. I'm not responding to his treatment as I should.\r\n\r\n_November_ 11.\r\n\r\nMet her this evening in Kensington Road. \"I timed this well,\" said she,\r\n\"I thought I should meet you.\" Good Heavens, I am getting embroiled.\r\nReturned to the flat with her and after supper called her \"The Lady of\r\nShalott.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you know what you're talking about\"--this stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" I answered. \"I leave it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! but it rests with you,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAm I in love? God knows--but I don't suppose God cares.\r\n\r\n_November_ 15.\r\n\r\nOn M----'s advice went to see a stomach specialist--Dr. Hawkins. As I\r\ngot there a little too early walked up the street--Portland Place--on\r\nthe opposite side (from shyness) past an interminable and nauseating\r\nseries of night bells and brass plates, then down again on the right\r\nside till I got to No. 66 which made me flutter--for ten doors ahead I\r\nmused is the house I must call at. It made me shiver a little.\r\n\r\nThe specialist took copious notes of my evidence and after examining me\r\nretired to consult with M----. What a parade of ceremony! On coming\r\nback, the jury returned a verdict of \"Not proven.\" I was told I ought to\r\ngo out and live on the prairies--and in two years I should be a _giant_!\r\nBut where are the prairies? What 'bus? If I get worse, I must take\r\nseveral months' leave. I think it will come to this.\r\n\r\n_November_ 16.\r\n\r\nArthur came down for the week end. He likes the Lady of Shalott. She is\r\n\"not handsome, but arresting, striking\" and \"capable of tragedy.\" That I\r\nbelieve she has achieved already.... If she were a bit more gloomy and a\r\nbit more beautiful, she'd be irresistible.\r\n\r\n_November_ 22.\r\n\r\nHe: \"Have a cigarette? I enjoy lighting your cigarettes.\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"I don't know how to smoke properly.\"\r\n\r\nHe: \"You smoke only as _you_ could.\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"How's that?\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"Gracefully, of course.\"\r\n\r\nS.: \"Do you think I like pretty things being said to me?\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"Why not, if they are true. Flattery is when you tell an ugly woman\r\nshe is beautiful. Have you so poor an opinion of yourself to think all I\r\nsay of you is flattery?\"\r\n\r\nS.: \"Yes. I am only four bare walls,--with nothing inside.\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"What a deliciously empty feeling that must be. ... But I don't\r\nthink you're so simple as all that. You bewilder me sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nS.: \"Why?\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"I feel like Sindbad the Sailor.\"\r\n\r\nS.: \"Why?\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"Because I'm not George Meredith.\" The title of \"husband\" frightens\r\nme.\r\n\r\n_December_ 9.\r\n\r\nIt's a fearful strain to go on endeavouring to live up to time with a\r\ncarefully laid-out time-table of future achievements. I am hurrying on\r\nwith my study of Italian in order to read the Life of Spallanzani in\r\norder to include him in my book--to be finished by the end of next year;\r\nI am also subsidising Jenkinson's embryological lectures at University\r\nCollege with the more detailed account of practical and experimental\r\nwork in his text-book; I have also started a lengthy research upon the\r\nTrichoptera--all with a horrible sense of time fleeing swiftly and\r\nopportunities for work too few ever to be squandered, and, in the\r\nbackground, behind all this feverish activity, the black shadow that I\r\nmight die suddenly with nothing done--next year, next month, next week,\r\nto-morrow, now!\r\n\r\nThen sometimes, as to-night, I have misgivings. Shall I do these things\r\nso well now as I might once have done them? Has not my ill-health\r\nseriously affected my mental powers? Surely the boy of 1908-10 was\r\nalmost a genius or--seen at this distance--a very remarkable youth in\r\nthe fanatical zeal with which he sought to pursue, and succeeded in\r\ngaining, his own end of a zoological education for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is a terrible suspicion to cross the mind of an ambitious youth that\r\nperhaps, after all, he is a very commonplace mortal--that his life,\r\nwhether comedy or tragedy, or both, or neither, is any way\r\ninsignificant, of no account.\r\n\r\nIt is still more devastating for him to have to consider whether the\r\nlaurel wreath was not once within his grasp, and whether he must not\r\nascribe his own incalculable loss to his stomach simply.\r\n\r\n_December_ 15.\r\n\r\nA very bad heart attack. As I write it intermits every three or four\r\nbeats. Who knows if I shall live thro' to-night?\r\n\r\n_December_ 16.\r\n\r\nHere I am once more. A passable night. After breakfast the intermittency\r\nrecommenced--it is better now, with a dropped beat only about once per\r\nhalf-hour, so that I am almost happy after yesterday, which was Hell.\r\nThe world is too good to give up without remonstrance at the beck of a\r\nweak heart.\r\n\r\nBefore I went to sleep last night, my watch stopped--I at once observed\r\nthe cessation of its tick and wondered if it were an omen. I was\r\ngenuinely surprised to find myself still ticking when I awoke this\r\nmorning. A moment ago a hearse passed down the street.... Yes, but I'm\r\ndamned if I haven't a right to be morbid after yesterday. To be ill like\r\nthis in a boarding-house! I'd marry to-morrow if I had the chance.\r\n\r\n_December_ 22.\r\n\r\n_Sollas's \"Ancient Hunters\"_\r\n\r\nRead Sollas's book _Ancient Hunters_--very thrilling--mind full of the\r\nAurignacians, Mousterians, Magdalenians! I have been peering down such\r\ntremendous vistas of time and change that my own troubles have been\r\neclipsed into ridiculous insignificance. It has been really a Pillar of\r\nStrength to me--a splendid tonic. Palæontology has its comfortable words\r\ntoo. I have revelled in my littleness and irresponsibility. It has\r\nrelieved me of the harassing desire to live, I feel content to live\r\ndangerously, indifferent to my fate; I have discovered I am a fly, that\r\nwe are all flies, that nothing matters. It's a great load off my life,\r\nfor I don't mind being such a micro-organism--to me the honour is\r\nsufficient of belonging to the universe--such a great universe, so grand\r\na scheme of things. Not even Death can rob me of that honour. For\r\nnothing can alter the fact that I _have_ lived; _I have been I_, if for\r\never so short a time. And when I am dead, the matter which composes my\r\nbody is indestructible--and eternal, so that come what may to my \"Soul,\"\r\nmy dust will always be going on, each separate atom of me playing its\r\nseparate part--I shall still have some sort of a finger in the Pie.\r\nWhen I am dead, you can boil me, burn me, drown me, scatter me--but you\r\ncannot destroy me: my little atoms would merely deride such heavy\r\nvengeance. Death can do no more than kill you.\r\n\r\n_December_ 27.\r\n\r\n\"It is a pleasure to note the success attending the career of Mr. W.N.P.\r\nBarbellion now engaged in scientific work on the staff of the Natural\r\nHistory Museum ...\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis is a cutting from the local paper--one of many that from time to\r\ntime I once delightedly pasted in the pages of the Journal. Not so now.\r\n\r\n... At 23, I am a different being. Surrounded by all the stimulating\r\nenvironment of scientific research, I am cold and disdainful. I keep up\r\nthe old appearances but underneath it is quite different. I am a\r\n_hypocrite_. I have to wear the mask and cothornoi, finding the part\r\ndaily more difficult to bear. I am living on my immense initial\r\nmomentum--while the machinery gradually slows up. My career! Gadzooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1913\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 3.\r\n\r\nFrom the drawing-room window I see pass almost daily an old gentleman\r\nwith white hair, a firm step, broad shoulders, healthy pink skin, a\r\nsunny smile--always singing to himself as he goes--a happy, rosy-cheeked\r\nold fellow, with a rosy-cheeked mind.... I should like to throw mud at\r\nhim. By Jove, how I hate him. He makes me wince with my own pain. It is\r\nheartless, indecently so, for an _old_ man to be so blithe. Life has, I\r\nsuppose, never lain in wait for him. The Great Anarchist has spared him\r\na bomb.\r\n\r\n_January_ 19.\r\n\r\nMy Aunt, aged 75, who has apparently concluded from my constant absences\r\nfrom Church that my spiritual life is in a parlous way, to-day read me\r\nher portion from a large book with a broad purple-tasseled bookmark. I\r\nlooked up from \"_I Promessi Sposi_\" and said \"Very nice.\" It was about\r\nsomeone whose soul was not saved and who would not answer the door when\r\nit was knocked. It is jolly to be regarded as a wicked, libidinous youth\r\nby an aged maiden Aunt.\r\n\r\n_January_ 22.\r\n\r\nThis Diary reads for all the world as if I were not living in mighty\r\nLondon. The truth is I live in a bigger, dirtier city--ill-health.\r\nIll-health, when chronic, is like a permanent ligature around one's\r\nlife. What a fine fellow I'd be if I were perfectly well. My energy for\r\none thing would lift the roof off....\r\n\r\nWe conversed around the text: \"To travel hopefully is better than to\r\narrive and true success is to labour.\" She is--well, so graceful. My\r\nGod! I love her, I love her, I love her!!!\r\n\r\n_February_ 3.\r\n\r\n_A Confession_\r\n\r\nH---- B---- invited me to tea to meet his fiancée.\r\n\r\nRather pleased with the invitation--I don't know why, for my idea of\r\nmyself is greater than my idea of him and probably greater than his idea\r\nof himself.\r\n\r\nYet I went and got shaved, and even thought of buying a new pair of\r\ngloves, but poverty proved greater than vanity, so I went with naked\r\nhands. On arriving at Turnham Green, I removed my spectacles (well\r\nknowing how much they damage my personal appearance). However, the\r\nbeauty of the thing was that, tho' I waited as agreed, he never turned\r\nup, and so I returned home again, crestfallen--and, with my spectacles\r\non again.\r\n\r\n_February_ 9.\r\n\r\n... \"Now, W----, talk to me prettily,\" she said as soon as the door was\r\nclosed on them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! make him read a book,\" whined her sister, but we talked of marriage\r\ninstead--in all its aspects. Bless their hearts, I found these two dear\r\nyoung things simply sodden with the idea of it.\r\n\r\nIn the middle I did a knee-jerk which made them scream with\r\nlaughing--the patellar reflex was new to them, so I seized a brush from\r\nthe grate, crossed to Her and gently tapped: out shot her foot, and\r\n----cried: \"Oh, do do it to me as well.\" It was rare fun.\r\n\r\n     \"Oh! pretty knee, what do I see?\r\n     And he stooped and he tied up my garter for me.\"\r\n\r\n_February_ 10.\r\n\r\nNews of Scott's great adventure! Scott dead a year ago!! The news, when\r\nI saw it to-night in the _Pall Mall Gazette_ gave me cold thrills. I\r\ncould have wept.... What splendid people we humans are! If there be no\r\nloving God to watch us, it's a pity for His sake as much as for our own.\r\n\r\n_February_ 15.\r\n\r\nTried to kiss her in a taxi-cab on the way home from the Savoy--the\r\ntaxi-cab danger is very present with us--but she rejected me quietly,\r\nsombrely. I apologised on the steps of the Flats and said I feared I had\r\ngreatly annoyed her. \"I'm not annoyed,\" she said, \"only surprised\"--in\r\na thoughtful, chilly voice.\r\n\r\nWe had had supper in Soho, and I took some wine, and she looked so\r\nbewitching it sent me in a fever, thrumming my fingers on the seat of\r\nthe cab while she sat beside me impassive. Her shoulders are exquisitely\r\nmodelled and a beautiful head is carried poised on a tiny neck.\r\n\r\n_February_ 16.\r\n\r\nWalking up the steps to her flat to-night made me pose to H---- (who was\r\nwith me) as Sydney Carton in the picture in _A Tale of Two Cities_ on\r\nthe steps of the scaffold. He laughed boisterously, as he is delighted\r\nto know of my last evening's misadventure.\r\n\r\nAt supper, a story was told of a man who knocked at the door of his\r\nlady's heart four times and at last was admitted. I remarked that the\r\nlast part of the romance was weak. She disagreed. H---- exclaimed, \"Oh!\r\nbut this man has no sentiment at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse for him,\" chimed in the others.\r\n\r\n\"He was 66 years of age,\" added Mrs.----.\r\n\r\n\"Too old,\" said P. \"What do you think the best age for a man to marry?\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"Thirty for a man, twenty-five for a woman.\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"That's right: it still gives me a little time.\"\r\n\r\nP.: \"What do _you_ think?\" (to me).\r\n\r\nI replied sardonically,--\r\n\r\n\"A young man may not yet and an old man not at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, old wet blanket,\" chirruped P----.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" I continued, delighted to seize the opportunity to assume\r\nthe role of youthful cynic, \"Cupid and Death once met at an Inn and\r\nexchanged arrows, since when young men have died and old men have\r\ndoted.\"\r\n\r\nH---- was charming enough to opine that it was impossible to fix a time\r\nfor love. Love simply came.\r\n\r\nWe warned him to be careful on the boat going out.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" said H---- (who is in love with P----).\r\n\r\n\"My brother had a dose of moonlight on board a boat when he sailed and\r\nhe's been happy ever since.\"\r\n\r\nP.: \"How romantic!\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"A great passion!\"\r\n\r\n\"The only difference,\" I interjected in a sombre monotone, \"between a\r\npassion and a caprice is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a book,\" She said in contempt.\r\n\r\nIt was--Oscar Wilde!\r\n\r\nP---- insisted on my taking a biscuit. \"Don't mind me,\" she said. \"Just\r\nthink I'm a waitress and take no notice at all.\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"Humph! I never see him taking no notice of a waitress.\"\r\n\r\n(Sneers and Curtain.)\r\n\r\n_February_ 24.\r\n\r\nH---- came home last night and told me that she said as he came away,\r\n\"Tell W---- I hate him.\" So it's all right. I shall go over to-morrow\r\nagain--Hurrah! My absence has been felt then.\r\n\r\n_March_ 7.\r\n\r\nCame home, lay on my bed, still dressed, and ruminated....\r\n\r\nFirst a suspicion then a conviction came to me that I was a cad--a\r\ncallous, selfish, sensation-hunting cad.... For the time being the\r\nbottom was knocked out of my smug self-satisfaction. For several long\r\nhalf-hours I found myself drifting without compass or stars. I was quite\r\ndisorientated, temporarily thrown off the balance of my _amour propre_.\r\nThen I got up, lit the gas and looking at myself in the mirror, found it\r\nwas really true,--I was a mean creature, wholly absorbed in self.\r\n\r\nAs an act of contrition, I ought to have gone out into the garden and\r\neaten worms. But the mirror brought back my self-consciousness and I\r\nbegan to crawl back into my recently discarded skin--I began to be less\r\nloathesome to myself. For as soon as I felt interested or amused or\r\ncurious over the fact that I had been really loathesome to myself I\r\nbegan to regain my equilibrium. _Now_, I and myself are on comparatively\r\neasy terms with one another. I am settled on the old swivel.... I take a\r\nlot of knocking off it and if shot off soon return.\r\n\r\nTo-day, she was silent and melancholy but wonderfully fascinating. One\r\nday I am desperate and the next cold and apathetic. Am I in love? God\r\nknows! She came to the door to say \"Good night,\" and I deliberately\r\nstrangled my desire to say something.\r\n\r\n_March_ 9.\r\n\r\nIn bed till 12.30 reading Bergson and the O.T.\r\n\r\nOver to the flat to supper. E---- was cold and silent. She spurned me.\r\nNo wonder. I talked volubly and quite brilliantly with the definite\r\npurpose of showing up J----'s somnolence. I also pulled his leg. He\r\nhates me. No wonder. After supper, he went in to her studio and remained\r\nthere alone with her while she worked. At 11 p.m. he was still there\r\nwhen I came away in a whirlwind of jealousy, regrets, and rage. G----\r\nsaid he was going to stay on until he saw \"the blighter off the\r\npremises.\" Neither of us would go in to turn him out.\r\n\r\nI love her deeply and once my heart jumped when I thought I heard her\r\ncoming into the room. But it was only P----. Did not see her again--even\r\nto say \"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n_March_ 10.\r\n\r\nWork in the evening in our bedroom--two poor miserable bachelors--H----\r\nreading Equity Law, a rug around his legs before an empty grate, while I\r\nam sitting at the table in top-coat, with collar up, and writing my\r\n_magnum opus,_ which is to bring me fame, fortune and--E----!\r\n\r\nH---- says that this morning I was putting on my shoes when he pointed\r\nout a large hole in the heel of my sock.\r\n\r\n\"Damn! I shall have to wear boots,\" I said--at least he says I said it,\r\nand I am quite ready to believe him. Such unconsciousness of self is\r\nrare with me.\r\n\r\n_March_ 15.\r\n\r\n[At a public dinner at the Holborn Restaurant] J----replied to the toast\r\nof the Ladies. Feeble! H---- and I stood and had a silent toast to E----\r\nand N---- by just winking one eye at each other. He sat opposite me.\r\n\r\nIf I had been asked to reply to this toast I should have said with the\r\ngreatest gusto, something as follows,--\r\n\r\n[Here follows the imaginary speech in full, composed the same night\r\nbefore going to sleep.]\r\n\r\nYet I am taken for a soft fool! My manner is soft, self-conscious, shy.\r\nWhat a lot of self-glorification I lose thereby! What a lot of\r\nself-torture I gain in its stead!\r\n\r\n_March_ 17.\r\n\r\nTo-day went to the B.M. but did very little work. Thought over the\r\nmatter carefully and decided to ask E---- to marry me. Relief to be able\r\nto decide. I was happy too.\r\n\r\nYesterday P---- came in to us from E----'s studio and said,--\r\n\r\n\"E---- sends her love.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom?\" H---- inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" P---- replied, smiling at me.\r\n\r\n_March_ 18.\r\n\r\nHad a long conversation with H---- last night. He says all E----\r\nintended to convey was that the quarrel was over.... I felt relieved,\r\nbecause I have no money, but--a large ambition. Then I am selfish, and\r\nhave not forgotten that I want to spend my holidays in the Jura, and\r\nnext year three weeks at the Plymouth Laboratory.\r\n\r\n_March_ 19.\r\n\r\nWent over to see E----. We had an awkward half-an-hour alone together.\r\nShe was looking bewitching! I am plunging more and more into love. Had\r\nit on the tip of my tongue once. I am dreadfully fond of her.\r\n\r\n\"I have a most profound gloom over me,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you try and get rid of it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I can't until Zeus has pity and rolls away the clouds.\"\r\n\r\n_April_ 21.\r\n\r\nWe are sitting up in our beds which are side by side in a room on the\r\ntop story of a boarding house in ---- Road.\r\n\r\nIt is 11.30 p.m. and I am leaning over one one side lighting the oil\r\nlamp so as to boil the kettle to make Ovaltine before going to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Whom have I seduced?\" I screamed. \"You rotter, don't you know that a\r\ndead passion full of regrets is as terrible as a dead body full of\r\nworms? There, I talk literature, my boy, if you were only Boswell\r\nenough to take it down.... As for K----, I shall never invite him to\r\ndinner again. He comes to me and whines that nobody loves him, and so I\r\nsay, 'Oh! poor lad, never mind, if you're bored, why, come to my rooms\r\nof an evening and hear me talk--you'll have the time of your life.' And\r\nnow he's cheeky.\"\r\n\r\nH. (sipping his drink and very much preoccupied with it) replied\r\nabstractedly, \"When you die you'll go to Hell.\" (I liked his Homeric\r\nsimplicity.) \"You ought to be buried in a fireproof safe.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nH. (returning to the attack), \"I hope she turns you down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"As for P----,\" he resumed, \"she's double-Dutch to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to the Berlitz School,\" I suggested, \"and learn the language.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bally fool.... All you do is to sit there and smile like a\r\nsanguinary cat. Nothing I say ever rouses you. I believe if I came to\r\nyou and said, 'Here, Professor, is a Beetle with 99 legs that has lived\r\non granite in the middle of the Sahara for 40 days and 40 nights,' you'd\r\nsimply answer, 'Yes, and that reminds me I've forgotten to blow my\r\nnose.'\"\r\n\r\nThe two pyjamaed figures shake with laughing, the light goes out and the\r\nsanguinary conversation continues on similar lines until we fall asleep.\r\n\r\n_April_ 26.\r\n\r\n_Two Months' Sick Leave_\r\n\r\nIn a horrible panic--the last few days--I believe I am developing\r\nlocomotor ataxy. One leg, one arm, and my speech are affected, _i.e._\r\nthe right side and my speech centre. M---- is serious.... I hope the\r\ndisease, whatever it is, will be sufficiently lingering to enable me to\r\ncomplete my book.\r\n\r\nR---- is a dear man. I shall not easily forget his kindness during this\r\nterrible week.... Can the Fates have the audacity?... Who can say?\r\n\r\n_April_ 27.\r\n\r\nI believe there can be no doubt that I have had a slight partial\r\nparalysis of my right side (like Dad). I stutter a little in my speech\r\nwhen excited, I cannot write properly (look at this handwriting), and my\r\nright leg is rocky at the knee. My head swims.\r\n\r\nIt is too inconceivably horrible to be buried in the Earth in such\r\nsplendid spring weather. Who can tell me what is in store for me?...\r\nLife opens to me, I catch a glimpse of a vision, and the doors clang to\r\nagain noiselessly. It is dark. That will be my history. Am developing a\r\npassionate belief in my book and a fever of haste to complete it before\r\nthe _congé définitif_.\r\n\r\n_April_ 29.\r\n\r\nSaw M---- again, who said my symptoms were alarming certainly, but he\r\nwas sure no definite diagnosis could be made.\r\n\r\n_April_ 30.\r\n\r\nWent with M---- to see a well-known nerve specialist--Dr. H----. He\r\ncould find no symptoms of a definite disease, tho' he asked me\r\nsuspiciously if I had ever been with women.\r\n\r\nOrdered two months' complete rest in the country. H---- chased me round\r\nhis consulting room with a drum-stick, tapping my nerves and cunningly\r\nworking my reflexes. Then he tickled the soles of my feet and pricked me\r\nwith a pin--all of which I stood like a man. He wears a soft black hat,\r\nlooks like a Quaker, and reads the _Verhandlungen d. Gesellschaft d.\r\nNervenarzten_.\r\n\r\nM---- is religious and after I had disclosed my physique to him\r\nyesterday (for the 99th time) he remained on his knees by the couch in\r\nhis consulting room (after working my reflexes) for a moment or two in\r\nthe attitude of prayer. When the Doctor prays for you--better call in\r\nthe undertaker. My epitaph \"He played Ludo well.\" The game anyhow\r\nrequires moral stamina--ask H----.\r\n\r\n_May_ 5.\r\n\r\nAt R----. Mugged about all day. Put on a gramophone record--then crawled\r\nup into a corner of the large, empty drawing room and ate my heart out.\r\nHeart has a bitter taste--if it's your own.\r\n\r\n_May_ 6.\r\n\r\nSat in the \"morning room\" feeling ill. In the chair opposite sat Aunt\r\nFanny, aged 86, knitting. I listened to the click of her needles, while\r\nout in the garden a thrush sang, and there was a red sunset.\r\n\r\n_May_ 8.\r\n\r\nBefore I left R----, A---- [My brother] had written to Uncle enclosing\r\nmy doctor's letter. I don't know the details except that Dr. M----\r\nemphasised the seriousness and yet held out hope that two months' rest\r\nwould allay the symptoms.\r\n\r\n_May_ 11.\r\n\r\n_At Home_\r\n\r\nI made some offensive remark to H---- whom I met in the street. This set\r\nhim off.\r\n\r\n\"You blighter, I hope you marry a loose woman. May your children be all\r\nbandy-legged and squint-eyed, may your teeth drop out, and your toes\r\nhave bunions,\" and so on in his usual lengthy commination.\r\n\r\nI turned to the third man.\r\n\r\n\"Bob--this!--after all I've done for that young man! I have even gone\r\nout of my Way to cultivate in him a taste for poetry--until he is now,\r\nin fact, quite wrapped up in it--indeed, so much so, that for a time he\r\nwas nothing but a brown paper parcel labelled Poetry.\"\r\n\r\nH. (doggedly): \"When are you going to die?\"\r\n\r\n\"That Master H----,\" I answered menacingly, \"is on the knees of the\r\nGods.\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"I shan't believe you're dead till I see your tombstone. I shall\r\nthen say to the Sexton, 'Is he really dead, then?' and the Sexton will\r\nsay, 'Well, 'ee's buried onny way.'\"\r\n\r\nBob was not quite in sympathy with our boisterous spirits.\r\n\r\n_May_ 15.\r\n\r\n_Gardening_\r\n\r\nSought out H---- as he was watering his petunias in the garden. He\r\ninformed me he was going to London on Monday.\r\n\r\nH.: \"Mother is coming too.\"\r\n\r\nB.: \"Why?\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"Oh! I'm buying my kit--shirts and things. I sail at the beginning\r\nof July.\"\r\n\r\nB.: \"I suppose shirts are difficult to buy. You wouldn't know what to do\r\nwith one if you had one. Your mother will lead you by the hand into a\r\nshop and say, 'H----, dear, this is a shirt,' and you'll reply with\r\npathos, 'Mother what are the wild shirts saying?'\"\r\n\r\nH.: \"You're a B.F.\" (goes on watering).\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what you'd do if you were let loose in a big garden,\" I began.\r\n\r\nH.: \"I should be as happy as a bird. I should hop about, chirrup and lay\r\neggs. You should have seen my tomato plants last year--one was as tall\r\nas father.\"\r\n\r\nB.: \"Now tell me of the Gooseberry as big as Mother.\"\r\n\r\nMutual execrations. Then we grinned and cackled at each other, emitting\r\nweird and ferocious cachinnations. Several times a day in confidential,\r\nserious tones--after one of these explosions--we say, \"I really believe\r\nwe're mad.\" You never heard such extraordinary caterwaulings. Our snappy\r\nconversations are interrupted with them every minute or so!\r\n\r\n_Stagnancy_\r\n\r\nA stagnant day. Lay still in the Park all day with just sufficient\r\nenergy to observe. The Park was almost empty. Every one but me at work.\r\nNothing is more dreary than a pleasure ground on workdays. There was one\r\nman a little way off throwing a ball to a clever dog. Behind me on the\r\npath, some one came along wheeling a pram. I listened in a kind of coma\r\nto the scrunching of the gravel in the distance a long time after the\r\npram was out of sight. Far away--the tinkle of Church bells in a village\r\nacross the river, and, in front, the man still throwing the ball to his\r\nclever dog.\r\n\r\n_May_ 25.\r\n\r\n_Death_\r\n\r\n... I suppose the truth is I am at last broken to the idea of Death. Once\r\nit terrified me and once I hated it. But now it only annoys me. Having\r\nlived with the Bogey for so long, and broken bread with him so often, I\r\nam used to his ugliness, tho' his persistent attentions bore me. Why\r\ndoesn't he do it and have done with me? Why this deference, why does he\r\npass me everything but the poison? Why am I such an unconscionably long\r\ntime dying?\r\n\r\nWhat embitters me is the humiliation of having to die, to have to be\r\npouring out the precious juices of my life into the dull Earth, to be no\r\nlonger conscious of what goes on, no longer moving abroad upon the Earth\r\ncreating attraction and repulsions, pouring out one's ego in a stream.\r\nTo think that the women I have loved will be marrying and forget, and\r\nthat the men I have hated will continue on their way and forget I ever\r\nhated them--the ignominy of being dead! What voluble talker likes his\r\nmouth to be stopped with earth, who relishes the idea of the carrion\r\nworm mining in the seat of the intellect?\r\n\r\n_May_ 29.\r\n\r\n_Renunciation_\r\n\r\nStaying at the King's Hotel, ----. Giddiness very bad. Death seems\r\nunavoidable. A tumour on the brain?\r\n\r\nComing down here in the train, sat in corner of the compartment, twined\r\none leg around the other, rested my elbow on the window ledge, and gazed\r\nout helplessly at the exuberant green fields, green woods, and green\r\nhedgerows. The weather was perfect, the sun blazed down.\r\n\r\nCertainly, I was rather sorry for myself at the thought of leaving it\r\nall. But I girded up my loins and wrapped around me for a while the\r\nmantle of a nobler sentiment; _i.e._ I felt sorry for the others as\r\nwell--for the two brown carters in the road ambling along with a timber\r\nwaggon, for the two old maids in the same compartment with me knitting\r\nbedsocks, for the beautiful Swallows darting over the stream, for the\r\nrabbit that lopped into the fern just as we passed--they too were all\r\nleaving it.\r\n\r\nThe extent of my benign compassion startled me--it was so unexpected.\r\nPerhaps for the first time in my life I forgot all about my own\r\nmiserable ambitions--I forgave the successful, the time-servers, the\r\nself-satisfied, the overweening, the gracious and condescending--all, in\r\nfact, who hitherto have been thorns in my flesh and innocently enough\r\nhave goaded me to still fiercer efforts to win thro'. \"Poor people,\" I\r\nsaid. \"Leave them alone. Let them be happy if they can.\" With a\r\nsubmissive heart, I was ready to sit down in the rows of this world's\r\nfailures and never have thought one bitter word about success. To all\r\nthose persons who in one way or another had foiled my purposes I\r\nextended a pardon with Olympian gravity, and, strangest of all, I could\r\nhave melted such frosty moral rectitudes with a genuine interest in the\r\ncareers of my struggling contemporaries. With perfect self-abnegation, I\r\nheld out my hand to them and wished them all \"God Speed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a strange metempsychosis. Yet of a truth it is no use being\r\nniggardly over our lives. We are all of us \"shelling out.\" And we can\r\nafford to be generous, for we shall all--some early, some late--be\r\nbankrupt in the end. For my part, I've had a short and boisterous voyage\r\nand shan't be sorry to get into port. I give up all my plans, all my\r\nhopes, all my loves and enthusiasms without remonstrance. I renounce\r\nall--I myself am already really dead.\r\n\r\n_May_ 30.\r\n\r\nLast night the sea was as flat as a pavement, a pretty barque with all\r\nher sails out to catch the smallest puff of wind--the tiniest\r\ninspiration--was nevertheless without motion--a painted ship on a\r\ntapestry of violet. H---- Hill was an immense angular mass of indigo\r\nblue. Even rowing boats made little progress and the water came off the\r\nlanguid paddles in syrupy clots. Everything was utterly still, the air\r\nthick--like cottonwool to the touch and very stifling; vitality in\r\nliving things leaked away under a sensuous lotus influence.\r\nIntermittently after the darkness had come, Bullpoint Lighthouse shone\r\nlike the wink of a lascivious eye.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPottering about all day on the Pier and Front, listening to other\r\npeople's talk, catching snippets of conversation--not edifying. If there\r\nwere seven wise men in the town, I would not save it. Damn the place!\r\n\r\n_May_ 31.\r\n\r\n... I espied her first in the distance and turned my head away quickly\r\nand looked out to sea. A moment after, I began to turn my head round\r\nagain slowly with the cautiousness and air of suspicion of a Tortoise\r\npoking its head out from underneath his shell. I was terrified to\r\ndiscover that in the meantime she had come and sat down on the seat\r\nimmediately behind me with her back to mine. We sat like this back to\r\nback for some time and I enjoyed the novel experience and the tension. A\r\nfew years ago, the bare sight of her gave me palpitation of the heart,\r\nand, on the first occasion that I had the courage to stop to speak, I\r\nfelt livid and the skin on my face twitched uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nPresently I got up and walked past--in the knowledge that she must now\r\nbe conscious of my presence after a disappearance of three years. Later\r\nwe met face to face and I broke the ice. She's a pretty girl.... So too\r\nis her sister.\r\n\r\nFew people, except my barber, know how amorous I am. He has to shave my\r\nsinuous lips.\r\n\r\n_June_ 3.\r\n\r\nSpent many dreadful hours cogitating whether to accept their invitation\r\nto dinner.... I wanted to go for several reasons. I wanted to see her in\r\na home-setting for the first time, and I wanted to spend the evening\r\nwith three pretty girls. I also had the idea of displaying myself to the\r\nscrutinising gaze of the family as the hero of the old romance: and of\r\nshowing Her how much I had progressed since last we met and what a\r\ntreasure she had lost.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I was afraid that the invitation was only a casual\r\none, I feared a snuffy reception, a frosty smile and a rigid hand. Could\r\nI go up and partake of meat at their board, among brothers and sisters\r\ntaking me for an ogre of a jilt, and she herself perhaps opposite me\r\nmaking me blush perpetually to recall our one-time passionate kisses,\r\nour love letters and our execrable verses to each other! There seemed\r\ndreadful possibilities in such an adventure. Yet I badly wanted to\r\nexperience the piquant situation.\r\n\r\nAt 7 p.m., half an hour before I was due, decided on strong measures. I\r\nentered a pub and took a stiff whisky and soda, and then set off with a\r\nstout heart to take the icy family by storm--and if need be live down my\r\nevil reputation by my amiability and urbanity!\r\n\r\nI went--and of course everything passed off in the most normal manner.\r\nShe is a very pretty girl--like velvet. Before dinner, we walked in the\r\ngarden--and talked only of flowers.\r\n\r\n_June_ 4.\r\n\r\nOn the Hill, this morning, felt the thrill of the news of my own Death:\r\nI mean I imagined I heard the words,--\r\n\r\n\"You've heard the news about B----?\"\r\n\r\nSecond Voice: \"No, what?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's dead.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nWon't all this seem piffle if I don't die after all! As an artist in\r\nlife I _ought_ to die; it is the only artistic ending --and I ought to\r\ndie now or the Third Act will fizzle out in a long doctor's bill.\r\n\r\n_June_ 5.\r\n\r\n_A New Pile in the Pier_\r\n\r\nWatched some men put a new pile in the pier. There was all the usual\r\nparaphernalia of chains, pulleys, cranes, and ropes, with a massive\r\nwooden pile swinging over the water at the end of a long wire hawser.\r\nEverything was in the massive style--even the men--very powerful men,\r\nslow, ruminative, silent men.\r\n\r\nNothing very relevant could be gathered from casual remarks. The\r\nconversation was without exception monosyllabic: \"Let go,\" or \"Stand\r\nfast.\" But by close attention to certain obscure movements of the man on\r\nthe ladder near the water's edge, it gradually came thro' to my\r\nconsciousness that all these powerful, silent men were up against some\r\nbitter difficulty. I cannot say what it was. The burly monsters were\r\nsilent about the matter.... In fact they appeared almost\r\nindifferent--and tired, oh! so very tired of the whole business. The\r\nattitude of the man nearest me was that for all he cared the pile could\r\ngo on swinging in mid-air to the crack of Doom.\r\n\r\nThey continued slow, laborious efforts to overcome the secret\r\ndifficulty. But these gradually slackened and finally ceased. One\r\nmassive man after another abandoned his post in order to lean over the\r\nrails and gaze like a mystic into the depths of the sea. No one spoke.\r\nNo one saw anything not even in the depths of the sea. One spat, and\r\nwith round, sad eyes contemplated the trajectory of his brown bolus (he\r\nhad been chewing) in its descent into the water.\r\n\r\nThe foreman, an original thinker, lit a cigarette, which relieved the\r\ntension. Then, slowly and with majesty, he turned on his heel, and\r\nwalked away. With the sudden eclipse of the foreman's interest, the\r\nincident closed. I should have been scarcely surprised to find him\r\nbehind the Harbour-master's Office playing \"Shove-ha'penny\" or skittles\r\nwith the pile still swinging in mid-air.... After all it was only a\r\nbloody pile.\r\n\r\n_June_ 11.\r\n\r\n_Depression_\r\n\r\nSuffering from depression.... The melancholy fit fell very suddenly. All\r\nthe colour went out of my life, the world was dirty gray. On the way\r\nback to my hotel caught sight of H----, jumping into a cab, after a\r\nvisit to S---- Sands. But the sight of him aroused no desire in me to\r\nshout or wave. I merely wondered how on earth he could have spent a\r\nhappy day at such a Sandy place.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at ----, sank deeper into my morass. It suffocated me to\r\nfind the old familiar landmarks coming into view ... the holiday-makers\r\nalong the streets how I hated them--the Peg Top Hill how desolate--all\r\nas before--how dull. The very fact that they were all there as before in\r\nthe morning nauseated me. The sea-coast here is magnificent, the town is\r\npretty--I know that, of course. But all looked dreary and\r\ncheerless--just the sort of feeling one gets on entering an empty house\r\nwith no fire on a winter's day and nowhere to sit down.... I felt as\r\nlonely and desolate as a man suddenly fallen from the clouds into an\r\nunknown town on the Antarctic Continent built of ice and inhabited by\r\nPenguins. Who are these people? I asked myself irritably. There perhaps\r\non the other side of the street was my own brother. But I was not even\r\nfaintly interested and told the cabman to drive on. The spray from the\r\nsea fogged my spectacles and made me weary.\r\n\r\n_June_ 14.\r\n\r\n_The Restlessness of the Sea_\r\n\r\nThe restlessness of the sea acts as a soporific on jangled nerves. You\r\ngaze at its incessant activities, unwillingly at first because they\r\ndistract your attention from your own cherished worries and griefs,--but\r\nlater you watch with complete self-abandon--it wrenches you out of\r\nyourself--and eventually with a kind of stupid hypnotic stare.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Spurgeon_\r\n\r\nThe day has been overcast, but to-night a soft breeze sprang up and\r\nswept the sky clear as softly as a mop. The sun coming out shone upon a\r\nwhite sail far out in the channel, scarcely another vessel hove in\r\nsight. The white sail glittered like a piece of silver paper whenever\r\nthe mainsail swung round as the vessel tacked. Its solitariness and\r\nwhiteness in a desert of marine blue attracted the attention and held it\r\ntill at last I could look at nothing else. The sight of it--so clean and\r\nwhite and fair--set me yearning for all the rarest and most exquisite\r\nthings my imagination could conjure up--a beautiful girl, with fair and\r\nsunburnt skin, brown eyes, dark eyebrows, and small pretty feet; a\r\ndewdrop in a violet's face; an orange-tip butterfly swinging on an umbel\r\nof a flower.\r\n\r\nThe sail went on twinkling and began to exert an almost moral influence\r\nover me. It drew out all the good in me. I longed to follow it on white\r\nwings--an angel I suppose--to quit this husk of a body \"as raiment put\r\naway,\" and pursue Truth and Beauty across the sea to the horizon, and\r\nbeyond the horizon up the sky itself to its last tenuous confines, no\r\ndoubt with a still small voice summoning me and the rest of the elect to\r\nan Agapemone, with Dr. Spurgeon at the door distributing tracts.\r\n\r\nI can scoff like this now. But at the time my exaltation was very real.\r\nMy soul strained in the leash. I was full of a desire for unattainable\r\nspiritual beauty. I wanted something. But I don't know what I want.\r\n\r\n_June_ 16.\r\n\r\n_My Sense of Touch_\r\n\r\nMy sense of touch has always been morbidly acute. I like to feel a\r\ncigarette locked in the extreme corner of my mouth. When I remove it\r\nfrom my mouth then I hold it probably up in the fork between two\r\nfingers. If I am waiting for a meal I finger the cool knives and forks.\r\nIf I am in the country I plunge my hands with outspread fingers into a\r\nmass of large-topped grasses, then close my fingers, crush and\r\ndecapitate the lot.\r\n\r\n_June_ 27.\r\n\r\n_Camping Out at S---- Sands_\r\n\r\nA brilliant summer day. Up early, breakfasted, and, clad in sweater and\r\ntrousers, walked up the sands to the boathouse with bare feet.\r\n\r\nEverything was wonderful! I strode along over the level sands infatuated\r\nwith the sheer ability to put one leg in front of the other and walk. I\r\nloved to feel the muscles of my thighs working, and to swing my arms in\r\nrhythm with the stride. The stiff breeze had blown the sky clear, and\r\nwas rushing through my long hair, and bellowing into each ear. I strode\r\nas Alexander must have done!\r\n\r\nThen I stretched my whole length out along a flat plank on the sands,\r\nwhich was as dry as a bone and warm. There was not a soul on the sands.\r\nEverything was bare, clean, windswept. My plank had been washed clean\r\nand white. The sands--3 miles of it--were hard and purified, level. My\r\neye raced along in every direction--there was nothing--not a bird or a\r\nman--to stop it. In that immense windswept space nothing was present\r\nsave me and the wind and the sea--a flattering moment for the egotist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the cliffs on the return journey met an old man gathering\r\nsticks. As he ambled along dropping sticks into a long sack he called\r\nout casually, \"Do you believe in Jesus Christ?\" in the tone of voice in\r\nwhich one would say, \"I think we shall have some rain before night.\"\r\n\"Aye, aye,\" came the answer without hesitation from a boy lying on his\r\nback in the sands a few yards distant, \"and that He died to save me.\"\r\n\r\nLife is full of surprises like this. The only other sounds I have heard\r\nto-day were the Herring Gull's cackle. Your own gardener will one day\r\nlook over his rake and give you the correct chemical formula for\r\ncarbonic acid gas. I met a postman once reading Shelley as he walked his\r\nrounds.\r\n\r\n_June_ 28.\r\n\r\nI am writing this by the lamp in the cabin among the sandhills waiting\r\nfor H---- to arrive from town with provisions. I wear a pair of bags, a\r\ndirty sweater, and go without hat or shoes and stockings. There is a\r\n\"Deadwood Dick\" atmosphere here. I'm a sort of bronco-breaker or rancher\r\noff duty writing home. In a minute I haven't the slightest doubt, H----\r\nwill gallop into the compound, tether his colt and come in \"raising\r\nCain\" for a belly-full of red meat.... If I am going to live after all\r\n(touch wood) I shall go abroad and be in the open.\r\n\r\nI eat greedily, am getting very sunburnt, am growing hairy (that means\r\nstrength!), and utter portentous oaths. If I stayed here much longer I\r\nshould grow a tail and climb trees.\r\n\r\nAfter a supper of fried eggs and fried bread done to a nicety, turned in\r\nat ten, and both of us lay warm and comfortable in bed, smoking\r\ncigarettes and listening to Hoffmann's Barcarolle on the gramophone. We\r\nput the lamp out, and it pleased us to watch the glow of each other's\r\ncigarettes in the dark.... Neither of us spoke.... Went to sleep at\r\nmidnight. Awoke at sunrise to hear an Owl still hooting, a Lark singing,\r\nand several Jackdaws clattering on our tin roof with their claws as they\r\nwalked.\r\n\r\n_July_ 1.\r\n\r\n_In London Again_\r\n\r\nReturned to London very depressed. Am not so well as I was three weeks\r\nago. The sight of one eye is affected, and I am haunted by the\r\npossibility of blindness. Then I have a numb feeling on one side of my\r\nface, and my right arm is less mobile.\r\n\r\nLeft darling Mother in a very weak state in bed, with neuritis and a\r\nweak heart. She cried when I said \"Goodbye,\" and asked me to go to\r\nChurch as often as I could, and to read a portion of Scripture every\r\nday. I promised. Then she added, \"For Dad's sake;\" just as if I would\r\nnot do it for her. Poor dear, she suffers a deal of pain. She does not\r\nknow how ill I am. I have not told her.\r\n\r\n_July_ 3.\r\n\r\nBack at work. A terrible day. Thoughts of suicide--a pistol.\r\n\r\n_July_ 8.\r\n\r\nI get thro' each day with the utmost difficulty. I have to wrestle with\r\nevery minute. Each hour is a conquest. The three quarters of an hour at\r\nlunch comes as a Godsend. I look forward to it all the morning, I enter\r\ninto it with joyful relief with no thought of the dreadful moment\r\nimpending when I must return and re-enter my room. By being wise like\r\nthis, I manage to husband my spirits and am relatively cheerful for one\r\nhour in the middle of each difficult day.\r\n\r\n_July_ 9.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I have gone to bed and hoped I should never wake up. Life\r\ngrows daily more impossible. To-day I put a slide underneath the\r\nmicroscope and looked at it. It was like looking at something thro' the\r\nwrong end of a telescope. I sat with eye glued to the ocular, so as to\r\nkeep up a pretence of work in case some one came in. My mind was\r\noccupied with quite different affairs. If one is pondering on Life and\r\nDeath, it is a terrible task to have to study Mites.\r\n\r\n_July_ 10.\r\n\r\nAm doing no work at all.... I sit motionless in my chair and beat the\r\ndevil's tattoo with my thumbs and think, think, think in the same\r\nhorrible circle hour after hour. I am unable to work. I haven't the\r\ncourage to. I've lost my nerve.\r\n\r\nAt five I return \"home\" to the Boarding-house and get more desperate.\r\n\r\nTwo old maids sat down to dinner to-night, one German youth (a\r\nlascivious, ranting, brainless creature), a lady typist (who takes drugs\r\nthey say), a dipsomaniac (who has monthly bouts--H---- carried him\r\nupstairs and put him to bed the other night), two invertebrate\r\nviolinists who play in the Covent Garden Orchestra, a colonial lady\r\nengaged in a bedroom intrigue with a man who sits at my table. What are\r\nthese people to me? I hate them all. They know it and are offended.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, put on my cap and rushed out anywhere to escape. Walked to\r\nthe end of the street, not knowing where I was going or what doing.\r\nStopped and stared with fixed eyes at the traffic in Kensington Road,\r\nundetermined what to do with myself and unable to make up my mind\r\n(volitional paralysis). Turned round, walked home, and went straight to\r\nbed 9 p.m., anxiously looking forward to to-morrow evening when I go to\r\nsee her again, but at the same time wondering how on earth I am to get\r\nthrough to-morrow's round before the evening comes.... This is a\r\nhand-to-mouth existence. My own inner life is scorching up all outside\r\ninterests. Zoology appears as a curious thing in a Bagdad bazaar. I sit\r\nin my room at the B.M. and play with it; I let it trickle thro' my\r\nfingers and roll away like a child playing with quicksilver.\r\n\r\n_July_ 11.\r\n\r\nOver to the flat. She was looking beautiful in a black dress, with a\r\nwhite silk blouse, and a Byron collar, negligently open in front as if\r\na button had come out. She said I varied: sometimes I went up in her\r\nestimation, sometimes down; once I went down very low. I understood her\r\nto say I was now UP! Alleluia!\r\n\r\n_July_ 14.\r\n\r\n... It would take too long and I am too tired to write out all the\r\nvarying phases of this day's life--all its impressions and petty\r\nmiseries chasing one another across my consciousness or leap-frogging\r\nover my chest like gleeful fiends.[1]\r\n\r\n_July_ 21.\r\n\r\nThoroughly enjoyed the journey up to town this morning. I secretly\r\ngloated over the fact that the train was dashing along over the rails to\r\nLondon bearing me and all the rest of the train's company upon their\r\npursuits--wealth, fame, learning. I was inebriated with the speed,\r\nferocity, and dash of living.... If the train had charged into the\r\nbuffers I should have hung my head out of the window and cheered. If a\r\nman had got in my way, I'd have knocked him down. The wheels of the\r\ncarriage were singing a lusty song in which I joined.\r\n\r\n_July_ 30.\r\n\r\n... We talked of men and women, and she said she thought men were\r\nneither angels nor devils but just men. I said I thought women were\r\neither angels or devils.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid to ask you which you think me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't,\" I said shortly.\r\n\r\n_August_ 9.\r\n\r\nHorribly upset with news from home. Mother is really ill. The Doctor\r\nfears serious nerve trouble and says she will always be an invalid. This\r\nis awful, poor dear! It's dreadful, and yet I have a tiny wish buried at\r\nthe bottom of my heart that she may be removed early from us rather\r\nthan linger in pain of body and mind. Especially do I hope she may not\r\nlive to hear any grievous news of me.... What irony that she should lose\r\nthe use of her right arm only two years after Dad's death from\r\nparalysis. It is cruel for it reminds her of Dad's illness.... What,\r\ntoo, would she think if she could have heard M----'s first words to me\r\nyesterday on one of my periodical visits to his consulting room, \"Well,\r\nhow's the _paralysis_?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the evening went over to see her. She was wearing a black silk gown\r\nand looked handsome.... She is always the same sombre, fascinating,\r\nlissom, soft-voiced She! She herself never changes.... What am I to do?\r\nI cannot give her up and yet I do not altogether wish to take her to my\r\nheart. It distresses me to know how to proceed. I am a wily fish.\r\n\r\n_August_ 10.\r\n\r\nSat in the gardens with her. We sat facing the sun for a while until she\r\nwas afraid of developing freckles and turned around, deliberately\r\nturning her back on good King Sol.... I said it was disrespectful.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! he doesn't mind,\" she said. \"He's a dear. He kissed me and said,\r\n'Turn round my dear if you like.'\"\r\n\r\nIsn't she tantalising?\r\n\r\nI wanted to say sarcastically, \"I wonder you let him kiss you,\" but\r\nthere was a danger of the remark reviving the dead.\r\n\r\n_August_ 14.\r\n\r\nI tried my best, I've sought every loophole of escape, but I am quite\r\nunable to avoid the melancholy fact that her thumbs are--lamentable. I\r\nam genuinely upset about it for I like her. No one more than I would be\r\nmore delighted if they were otherwise.... Poor dear! how I love her!\r\nThat's why I'm so concerned about her thumbs.\r\n\r\n_August_ 21.\r\n\r\nA wire from A---- came at 11.50 saying \"Darling Mother passed peacefully\r\naway yesterday afternoon.\" ... Yesterday afternoon I was writing Zoology\r\nand all last night I slept soundly.... It was quite sudden. Caught the\r\nfirst train home.\r\n\r\n_August_ 23.\r\n\r\nThe funeral.\r\n\r\n_August_ 31.\r\n\r\nStaying at the Hotel du Guesclin at Cancale near St. Malo with my dear\r\nA----.\r\n\r\nThis flood of new experiences has knocked my diary habit out of gear. To\r\nbe candid, I've forgotten all about myself. I've been too engrossed in\r\nliving to stand the strain of setting down and in cold blood writing out\r\nall the things seen and heard. If I once began I should blow thro' these\r\npages like a whirlwind.... But what a waste of time with M. le batelier\r\nwaiting outside with his bisque to take us mackerel fishing!...\r\n\r\n_September_ 8.\r\n\r\nReturned to Southampton yesterday. Have spent the night at Okehampton in\r\nDevonshire _en route_ for T---- Rectory. This morning we hatched the\r\nridiculous idea of hiring two little Dartmoor ponies and riding out from\r\nthe town. A---- rides fairly well tho' he has not been astride a beast\r\nfor years. As for me, I cannot ride at all! Yet I had the idea that I\r\ncould easily manage a pretty little pony with brown eyes and a long\r\ntail. On going out into the Inn yard, was horrified--two horses\r\nsaddled--one a large traction beast.... I climbed on to the smaller one,\r\nwalked him out of the yard and down the road in good style without\r\naccident. Once in the country, however, my animal, the fresher of the\r\ntwo, insisted on a smart trot which shook me up a good deal so that I\r\nhardly kept my seat. This eventually so annoyed the animal that it\r\nbegan to fidget and zigzag across the road--no doubt preparing to break\r\naway at a stretch gallop when once it had rid itself of the\r\nincomprehensible pair of legs across its back.\r\n\r\nI got off quickly and swopped horses with A----.\r\n\r\nWalked him most of the way, while A---- cantered forward and back to\r\ncheer me on. Ultimately however this beast, too, got sick of walking and\r\nbegan to trot. For a time I stood this well and began to rise in my\r\nsaddle quite nicely. After two miles, horrible soreness supervened, and\r\nI had to get off--very carefully, with a funny feeling in my legs--even\r\nlooked down at them to assure myself they were not bandy! In doing so,\r\nthe horse--this traction monster--stepped on my toe and I swore.\r\n\r\nOn nearing the village, L---- arrived, riding A----'s animal and holding\r\nhis sides for laughing at me as I crawled along holding the carthorse by\r\nthe bridle. Got on again and rode into the Rectory grounds in fine style\r\nlike a dashing cavalier, every one jeering at me from the lawn.\r\n\r\n_September_ 28.\r\n\r\nHaving lived on this planet now for the space of 24 years, I can claim\r\nwith some cogency that I am qualified to express some sort of opinion\r\nabout it. I therefore hereby record that I find myself in an absorbingly\r\ninteresting place where I live, move and have my being, dominated by one\r\nmonstrous feature above all others--the mystery of it all! Everything is\r\nso astonishing, my own existence so incredible!\r\n\r\nNothing explains itself. Every one is dumb. It is like walking about at\r\na masqued Ball.... Even I myself am a mystery to me. How wonderful and\r\nfrightening that is--to feel yourself--your innermost and most\r\nsubstantial possession to be a mystery, incomprehensible. I look at\r\nmyself in the mirror and mock at myself. On some days I am to myself as\r\nstrange and unfamiliar as a Pterodactyl. There is a certain grim humour\r\nin finding myself here possessed of a perfectly arbitrary arrangement\r\nof lineaments when I never asked to be here and never selected my own\r\nattributes. To the dignity of a human being it seems like a coarse\r\npractical joke.... My own freakish physique is certainly a joke.\r\n\r\n_October_ 4.\r\n\r\n_In London Again_\r\n\r\nK---- comes in from her dancing class, nods to me, hugs her sister\r\naround the neck and says,--\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you dear thing, you've got a cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't do that,\" I remark, green-eyed, \"she's in an awful wax\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"Oh! I don't mind K----!\"\r\n\r\n(Laughter!)\r\n\r\n_October_ 8.\r\n\r\nHeard a knock at the door last night, and, thinking it was R----, I\r\nunbolted it and let in a tramp who at once asked God to bless me and\r\ncrown all my sorrow with joy. An amiable fellow to be sure--so I gave\r\nhim some coppers and he at once repeated with wonderful fervour, \"God\r\nbless you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish He would,\" I answered, \"I have a horrible cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I know, I gets it myself and the hinfluenza--have you had that,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes I should have told him all my personal history. But he\r\nwas thirsting for a drink and went off quickly and left me with my heart\r\nunburthened. London is a lonely place.\r\n\r\nTo-day journeyed to ---- where I gave evidence as an _expert_ in Economic\r\nEntomology at the County Court in a case concerning damage to furniture\r\nby mites for which I am paid £8 8s. fee and expenses and travelled first\r\nclass. What irony! (See June 30, 1911.)\r\n\r\n_October_ 11.\r\n\r\nI may be a weak, maundering, vacillating fool but I cannot help loving\r\nher on one day, being indifferent the next and on some occasions even\r\ndisliking her.... To-day she was charming, with a certain warm glossy\r\nperfection on her face and hair.... And she loves me--I could swear it.\r\n\"And when a woman woos ...\" etc. How difficult for a vain and lonely man\r\nto resist her. She tells me many times in many dainty ways that she\r\nloves me without so much as stopping her work to talk.\r\n\r\nI wish I were permanently and irresistibly enamoured. I want a\r\n_bouleversement_....\r\n\r\n_October_ 13.\r\n\r\nWent to see a Harley Street oculist about the sight of one eye, which\r\nhas caused a lot of trouble and worry of late and continuously haunted\r\nme with the possibility of blindness. At times, I see men as trees\r\nwalking and print becomes hopelessly blurred.\r\n\r\nThe Specialist however is reassuring. The eye is healthy --no\r\nneuritis--but the adjustment muscles have been thrown out of gear by the\r\nnervous troubles of last spring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWas ever man more sorely tempted? Here am I lonely and uncomfortable in\r\ndiggings with a heart like nascent oxygen.... Shall I? Yes, but.... And\r\nI have neither health nor wealth.\r\n\r\n_October_ 22.\r\n\r\n_The British Museum Reading Room_\r\n\r\nI saw it for the first time to-day! Gadzooks!! This is the only fit\r\nejaculation to express my amazement! It's a pagan temple with the Gods\r\nin the middle and all around, various obscure dark figures prostrating\r\nthemselves in worship.\r\n\r\nFor any one who is not simply a Sheep or Cow or whose nervous\r\norganisation is a degree more sensitive than the village blacksmith's,\r\nit is a besetting peril to his peace of mind to be constantly moving\r\nabout an independent being, with loves and hates, and a separate\r\nidentity among other separate identities, who prowl and prowl around\r\nlike the hosts of Midian--ready to snarl, fight, seize you, bore you,\r\nexasperate you, to arouse all your passions, call up all the worst from\r\nthe depths where they have lain hidden.... A day spent among my fellows\r\ngoads me to a frenzy by the evening. I am no longer fit for human\r\ncompanionship. People string me up to concert pitch. I develop\r\nsuspicions of one that he is prying, of another that he patronises.\r\nOthers make me horribly anxious to stand well in their eyes and horribly\r\ncurious to know what they think of me. Others I hate and loathe--for no\r\nparticular reason. There is a man I am acquainted with concerning whom I\r\nknow nothing at all. He may be Jew, Gentile, Socinian, Pre-adamite,\r\nAnabaptist, Rosicrucian--I don't know, and I don't care, for I hate him.\r\nI should like to smash his face in. I don't know why.... In the whole\r\ncourse of our tenuous acquaintance we have spoken scarce a dozen words\r\nto each other. Yet I should like to blow up his face with dynamite. If I\r\nhad £200 a year private income I should be in wait for him to-morrow\r\nround a corner and land him one--just to indicate my economic\r\nindependence. He would call for the police and the policeman--discerning\r\ncreature--on arrival, would surely say, \"With a face like that, I'm not\r\nsurprised.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nR---- said to me this morning, \"Well, have you heard?\" with an\r\nexuberance of curiosity that made my blood boil--he was referring to my\r\nEssay still at the bar of the opinion of the Editor of the _English\r\nReview_. \"You beast,\" I snapped and walked off.\r\n\r\nR---- shouted with laughter for he realizes my anger with him is only\r\nsemi-serious: it is meant and not meant: meant, for it is justified by\r\nthe facts; not meant, for I can't be too serious over anything _au\r\nfond_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all the grim and ridiculous odds and ends of chance that Fortune has\r\nrolled up to my feet, my friendship with a man like B---- is the\r\ngrimmest and most ridiculous. He is a bachelor of sixty, rather\r\ngood-looking, of powerful physique and a faultless constitution.... His\r\nignorance is colossal and he once asked whether Australia, for example,\r\ntho' surrounded by water, is not connected up with other land underneath\r\nthe sea. Being himself a child in intelligence (tho' commercially\r\ncunning), he has a great respect for my brains. Being himself a strong\r\nman, he views my ill-health with much contempt. His private opinion is\r\nthat I am in consumption. When asked once by a lady if I were not going\r\nto be \"a great man\" one day, he replied, \"Yes--if he lives.\" I ought to\r\nwalk six miles a day, drink a bottle of stout with my dinner, and eat\r\nplenty of _onions_. His belief in the curative properties of onions is\r\nstrong as death....\r\n\r\nHis system of prophylaxis may be quickly summarised,--\r\n\r\n(1) Hot whisky _ad lib_. and off to bed.\r\n\r\n(2) A woman.\r\n\r\nThese two sterling preventives he has often urged upon me at the same\r\ntime tipping out a quantity of anathemas on doctors and physic....\r\n\r\nHe is a cynic. He scoffs at the medical profession, the Law, the Church,\r\nthe Press. Every man is guilty until he is proved innocent. The Premier\r\nis an unscrupulous character, the Bishop a salacious humbug. No doctor\r\nwill cure, for it pays him to keep you ill. Every clergyman puts the\r\nSunday-school teacher in the family way. His mouth is permanently\r\ndistorted by cynicism.\r\n\r\nHe is vain and believes all women are in love with him. When playing the\r\nGallant, he turns on a special voice, wears white spats, and looks like\r\na Newmarket \"Crook.\"\r\n\r\n\"I lost my 'bus,\" a girl says to him. \"Lost your bust,\" he answers, in\r\nbroad Scotch. \"I can't see that you've done that.\" ... His sexual career\r\nhas been a remarkable one, he claiming to have brought many women to\r\nbed, and actually to have lain with women of almost all European\r\nnationalities, for he has been a great traveller....\r\n\r\nThis man is my devoted friend!... And truth to tell I get on with him\r\nbetter than I do with most people. I like his gamey flavour, his utter\r\nabsence of self-consciousness, and his doggy loyalty to myself--his\r\nweaker brother. He may be depraved in his habits, coarse in his\r\nlanguage, boorish in his manners, ludicrous in the wrongness of all his\r\nviews. But I like him just because he is so hopeless. I get on with him\r\nbecause it is so impossible to reclaim him--my missionary spirit is not\r\nintrigued. If he only dabbled in vice (for an experiment), if he had\r\npale, watery ideas about current literature--if--to use his own\r\nfavourite epithet--he were _genteel_, I should quarrel.\r\n\r\n_October_ 30.\r\n\r\nHaving developed a passion for a piece of sculpture by R. Boeltzig\r\ncalled the Reifenwerferin--the most beautiful figure of a woman. I am\r\nalready devoted to Rodin's \"Kiss\" and have a photo of it framed in my\r\nbedroom. Have written to Bruciani's.\r\n\r\nI suspect that my growing appreciation of the plastic art is with me\r\nonly distilled sensuality. I enjoy my morning bath for the same reason.\r\nMy bath is a daily baptism. I revel in the pleasure of the pain of the\r\ncold water. I whistle gleefully because I am clean and cool and nude\r\nearly in the morning with the sun still low, before the day has been\r\nstained by clothes, dirt, pain, exasperation, death.... How I love\r\nmyself as I rub myself down!--the cool, pink skin--I could eat it! I\r\nwant to be all day in a cold bath to enjoy the pain of mortifying the\r\nflesh--it is so beautiful, so soft, so inscrutable--if I cut out chunks\r\nof it, it would only bleed.\r\n\r\n_November_ 8.\r\n\r\nThe other morning R---- said hyperbolically that he hadn't slept all\r\nnight for fear that, before he had time to put an arresting hand on my\r\nshoulder and say \"Don't,\" I might have gone and become \"Entangled.\" ...\r\n\r\n... No, I'm as firm as a rock, my dear. But in imagination the affair\r\nwas continued as follows,--\r\n\r\nShe: \"I am fond of you, you know.\"\r\n\r\nHe: \"I wish you wouldn't say these things to me--they're quite\r\nembarrassing.\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"Oh! my dear, I'm not serious, you know--you're such a vain young\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nHe: \"Well, it's equally embarrassing any way.\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"Then I _am_ serious.\"\r\n\r\nTears.\r\n\r\nI say: \"I wish you would take me only for what I am--a blackguard with\r\nno good intentions, yet no very evil ones--but still a blackguard, whom\r\nyou seem to find has engaging manners.\"\r\n\r\nI breathe freely hoping to have escaped this terrible temptation and\r\nturn to go. But she, looking up smiling thro' a curtain of wet\r\neyelashes, asks,--\r\n\r\n\"Won't the blackguard stop a little longer?\" In a moment my earth works,\r\nredoubts, and bastions fall down, I rush forward impetuously into her\r\narms shouting, \"I _will_, I _will_, I will as long as for eternity.\"\r\n\r\n(Curtain.)\r\n\r\nI dramatised this little picture and much more last night before going\r\nto sleep when I was in a fever. I should succumb at once to the first\r\nreally skilful coquette.\r\n\r\n_November_ 9.\r\n\r\n_Ludo_\r\n\r\nWe played Ludo together this evening and she won 2s. 6d. Handsomely\r\ngowned in black and wearing black ornaments, she sat with me in the\r\nlamplight on the sofa in the Morris Room, with the Ludo board between us\r\nplaced on a large green cushion. Her face was white as parchment and\r\nher hair seemed an ebony black. I lolled in the opposite corner, a thin,\r\nelongated youth, with fair hair all stivvered up, dressed in a\r\nlight-brown lounge suit with a good trouser crease, a soft linen collar\r\nand--a red tie! Between us, on its green cushion the Ludo board with its\r\nbrilliantly coloured squares:--all of it set before a background formed\r\nby the straight-backed, rectangular, settle-like sofa, with a charming\r\ncovering which went with the rest of the scheme.\r\n\r\n\"Rather decorative,\"---- remarked in an audible voice, turning her head\r\non one side and quizzing. I can well believe it was. _She_ looked wholly\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\n_November_ 21.\r\n\r\n_My Nightmare_\r\n\r\nCan't get rid of my cough. I have so many things to do--I am living in a\r\nfever of haste to get them done. Yet this cough hinders me. There is\r\nalways something which drags me back from the achievement of my desires.\r\nIt's like a nightmare; I see myself struggling violently to escape from\r\na monster which draws continuously nearer, until his shadow falls across\r\nmy path, when I begin to run and find my legs tied, etc. The only\r\ndifference is that mine is a nightmare from which I never wake up. The\r\nhaven of successful accomplishment remains as far off as ever. Oh! make\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\n_November_ 29.\r\n\r\nThe _English Review_ has returned my Essay!--This is a keen\r\ndisappointment to me. \"I wish I could use this, but I am really too\r\nfull,\" the Editor writes. To be faintly encouraged and delicately\r\nrejected--why I prefer the printed form.\r\n\r\n_December_ 1.\r\n\r\n_More Irony_\r\n\r\nRenewed my cold--I do nothing all day but blow my nose, cough, and curse\r\nAustin Harrison.\r\n\r\nM---- thinks the lungs are all right. \"There is nothing there, I think,\"\r\nsaid he, this morning. Alleluia! I've had visions of consumption for\r\nweeks past and M---- himself has been expecting it. I always just escape:\r\nI always almost get something, do something, go somewhere, I have\r\ndabbled in a variety of diseases, but never got one downright[2]--but\r\nonly enough to make me feel horribly unfit and very miserable without\r\nthe consolation of being able to regard myself as the heroic victim of\r\nsome incurable disorder. Instead of being Stevenson with tuberculosis,\r\nI've only been Jones with dyspepsia. So, too, in other directions, big\r\nevents have always just missed me: by Herculean efforts I succeeded in\r\ngiving up newspaper journalism and breaking thro' that steel\r\nenvironment--but only to become an Entomologist! I once achieved success\r\nin an Essay in the _Academy_, which attracted attention--a debut,\r\nhowever, that never developed. I had not quite arrived. It is always\r\n_not quite_.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I received a state visit from the Editor of the _Furniture\r\nRecord_ seeking advice on how to eradicate mites from upholstering! I\r\nreceived him ironically--but little did he understand.\r\n\r\nI shot up like a ball on a bagatelle board all steamy into zoology (my\r\nonce beloved science) but at once rolled dead into the very low hole of\r\nEconomic Entomology! Curse.... Why can't I either have a first-rate\r\ndisease or be a first-rate zoologist?\r\n\r\nNow just think what a much better figure I should have cut, from the\r\nartistic view point, had I remained a newspaper reporter who had taught\r\nhimself prodigious embryology out of F.M. Balfour's Textbook, who had\r\ncut sections of fowls' eggs and newt embryos with a hand microtome, who\r\nhad passionately dissected out the hidden, internal anatomy of a great\r\nvariety of animals, who could recite Wiedersheim's _Comparative Anatomy\r\nof Vertebrates_ and patter off the difference between a nephridium and a\r\ncœlomic duct without turning a hair--or the phylogenetic history (how\r\nabsorbing!) of the kidney--pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros and\r\nall the ducts!... All this, over now and wasted. My hardly-won\r\nknowledge wrenched away is never brought into use--it lies piled up in\r\nmy brain rotting. I could have become a first-rate comparative\r\nanatomist.\r\n\r\n_December_ 3.\r\n\r\nCold better. So back at work--gauging ale at Dunfermline as R---- puts\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_December_ 9.\r\n\r\nIn the evening found it quite impossible to stay in the house any\r\nlonger: some vague fear drove me out. I was alarmed to be alone or to be\r\nstill. It is my cough, I think.\r\n\r\nHad two glasses of port at the Kensington Hotel, conversed with the\r\nbarmaid, and then came home.\r\n\r\n_December_ 10.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be an old fossil,\" she said to me to-night, irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\"_A propos_ of what?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, here's W---- proposing to E----! Do come,\" cried ----, with\r\nintent to confuse. I laughed heartlessly.\r\n\r\nDear, dear, where will it all end? It's a sad business when you fall in\r\nlove with a girl you don't like.\r\n\r\n_December_ 26.\r\n\r\nSpent a romping day at the Flat. Kissed her sister twice under the\r\nmistletoe, and in the evening went to a cinema. After supper made a mock\r\nheroic speech and left hilarious.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"The life of the Soul is different; there is nothing more changing,\r\nmore varied, more restless ... to describe the incidents of one hour\r\nwould require an eternity.\"--_Journal of Eugénie de Guérin_.\r\n\r\n[2] See entry for November 27, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1914\r\n\r\n\r\n_February_ 4.\r\n\r\n... Finally and in conclusion I have fallen ill again, have again\r\nresumed my periodical visits to the Doctor, and am swallowing his\r\nrat-poison in a blind faith as aforetime. In fact, I am in London,\r\nleading the same solitary life, seeing no one, talking to no one, and\r\ndaily struggling with this demon of ill-health. Can no one exorcise him?\r\nThe sight of _both_ my eyes is affected now. Blindness?\r\n\r\nB---- continues whoring, drinking, sneering. R---- as usual, devoid of\r\nemotion, cold, passionless, Shavian, and self-absorbed, still titillates\r\nhis mind with etching, sociology, music, etc., and I have at last ceased\r\nto bore him with what he probably calls the febrile utterances of an\r\noverwrought mind.\r\n\r\nSuch is my world! Oh! I forgot--on the floor below me is a corpse--that\r\nof an old gentleman who passed away suddenly in the night. In the small\r\nhours, the landlady went for the Doctor over the way, but he refused to\r\ncome, saying the old man was too aged. So the poor gentleman died\r\nalone--in this rat hole of a place.\r\n\r\n_February_ 7.\r\n\r\nIntending to buy my usual 3d. packet of Goldflakes, entered a\r\ntobacconist's in Piccadilly, but once inside surprised to find myself in\r\na classy west-end establishment, which frightened my flabby nature into\r\nbuying De Reszke's instead. I hadn't the courage to face the aristocrat\r\nbehind the counter with a request for Goldflakes--probably not stocked.\r\nWhat would he think of me? Besides, I shrank from letting him see I was\r\nnot perfectly well-to-do.\r\n\r\n_February_ 14.\r\n\r\nI wonder what this year has in store for me? The first twenty-four years\r\nof my life have hunted me up and down the keyboard--I have been right to\r\nthe top and also to the bottom--very happy and very miserable. Yet I\r\nprefer the life that is a hunt and an adventure. I don't really mind\r\nbeing chased like this. I almost thrive on the excitement. If I knew\r\nalways where to look with any degree of certainty for my next day's life\r\nI should yawn! \"What if to-day be sweet,\" I say, and never look ahead.\r\nTo me, next week is next century.\r\n\r\nThe danger and uncertainty of my life make me cherish and hug closely to\r\nmy heart various little projects that otherwise would seem unworthy. I\r\nwork at them quickly, frantically, sometimes, afraid to whisper to a\r\nliving soul what expectations I dare to harbour in my heart. What if\r\n_now_ the end be near? Not a word! Let me go onward.\r\n\r\n_February_ 15.\r\n\r\nTo-day I have reviewed the situation carefully, exhaustively. I have\r\npeered into every aspect of my life and achievements and everything I\r\nhave seen nauseates me. I can find no ray of comfort in anything I have\r\ndone or in anything I might do. My life seems to have been a wilderness\r\nof futile endeavour. I started wrong from the very beginning. At the\r\nmoment of my birth I was coming into the world in the wrong place and\r\nunder wrong conditions. Why seek to overcome such colossal initial\r\ndisadvantages? In this mood I found fault with my parentage, my\r\ninheritance, all my mental and physical disabilities....\r\n\r\nThis must be a form of incipient insanity. Even as a boy, I can remember\r\nbeing preternaturally absorbed in myself and preternaturally\r\ndiscontented. I was accustomed to exhaust my mind by the most harassing\r\ncross-examinations--no Counsel at the Bar ever treated a witness more\r\nmercilessly. After a day of this sort of thing, when silently and\r\nmorbidly in every spare moment, at meals, in school, or on a walk, I\r\nwould incessantly ply the questions, \"What is the ultimate value of your\r\nwork, _cui bono_?\" etc. I went to bed in the evening with a feeling of\r\nhopelessness and dissatisfaction--haggard with considerations and\r\nreconsiderations of my outlook, my talent, my character, my future. In\r\nbed, I tossed from side to side, mentally exhausted with my efforts to\r\nobtain some satisfying conclusion--always hopeful, determined to the\r\nlast to be able to square up my little affairs before going to sleep.\r\nBut out of this mazy, vertiginous mass of thinking no satisfaction ever\r\ncame. _Now_, I thought--or the _next moment_--or as soon as I review and\r\nrevise myself in this or in that aspect, I shall be content. And so I\r\nwent on, tearing down and reforming, revising and reviewing, till\r\nfinally from sheer exhaustion and very unhappy I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNext morning I was all right.\r\n\r\n_February_ 20.\r\n\r\nAm feeling very unwell. My ill-health, my isolation, baulked ambitions,\r\nand daily breadwinning all conspire to bring me down. The idea of a\r\npistol and the end of it grows on me day by day.\r\n\r\n_February_ 21.\r\n\r\nAfter four days of the most profound depression of spirits, bitterness,\r\nself-distrust, despair, I emerged from the cloud to-day quite suddenly\r\n(probably the arsenic and strychnine begins to take effect) and walked\r\nup Exhibition Road with the intention of visiting the Science Museum\r\nLibrary so as to refer to Schafer's _Essentials of Histology_ (I have to\r\nwatch myself carefully so that I may act _at once_ as soon as the\r\nbalance of mind is restored). In the lobby was a woman screaming as if\r\nin pain, with a passer-by at her side saying sternly, \"What is the\r\nmatter with you?\" as if she were making herself ridiculous by suffering\r\npain in public.\r\n\r\nI passed by quickly, pretending not to notice lest--after all--I should\r\nbe done out of my _Essentials of Histology._ Even in the Library I very\r\nnearly let the opportunity slide by picking up a book on squaring the\r\ncircle, the preface and introduction of which I was forced to read.\r\n\r\n_March_ 4.\r\n\r\n_The Entomological Society_\r\n\r\nThere were a great many Scarabees present who exhibited to one another\r\npoor little pinned insects in collecting-boxes ... It was really a\r\none-man show, Prof. Poulton, a man of very considerable scientific\r\nattainments, being present, and shouting with a raucous voice in a way\r\nthat must have scared some of the timid, unassuming collectors of our\r\ncountry's butterflies and moths. Like a great powerful sheep-dog, he got\r\nup and barked, \"Mendelian characters,\" or \"Germ plasm,\" what time the\r\nobedient flock ran together and bleated a pitiful applause. I suppose,\r\nhaving frequently heard these and similar phrases fall from the lips of\r\nthe great man at these reunions, they have come to regard them as\r\nsymbols of a ritual which they think it pious to accept without any\r\nquestion. So every time the Professor says, \"Allelomorph,\" or some such\r\nphrase, they cross themselves and never venture to ask him what the hell\r\nit is all about.\r\n\r\n_March_ 7.\r\n\r\n_A Scots Fir_\r\n\r\nHave been feeling very \"down\" of late, but yesterday I saw a fine Scots\r\nFir by the roadside--tall, erect, as straight as a Parthenon pillar. The\r\nsight of it restored my courage. It had a tonic effect. Quite\r\nunconsciously I pulled my shoulders back and walked ahead with renewed\r\nvows never to flinch again. It is a noble tree. It has strength as a\r\ngiant, and a giant's height, and yet kindly withal, the branches\r\ndrooping down graciously towards you--like a kind giant extending its\r\nhands to a child.\r\n\r\n_March_ 22.\r\n\r\n_A Stagnant Day_\r\n\r\nWent to bed late last night so I slept on soundly till 9 a.m. Went down\r\nto the bath-room, but found the door was shut, so went back to my\r\nbedroom again, lay down and dosed a while, thinking of nothing in\r\nparticular. Went down again--door still locked--swore--returned once\r\nmore to my room and reclined on the bed, with door open, so that I could\r\nhear as soon as the bath-room door opened.... Rang the bell, and\r\nMiss ---- brought up a jug of hot water to shave with, and a tumbler of hot\r\nwater to drink (for my dyspepsia). She, on being interrogated, said\r\nthere was some one in the bath-room. I said I wanted a bath too, so as\r\nshe passed on her way down she shouted, \"Hurry up, Mr. Barbellion wants\r\na bath as well.\" Her footsteps then died away as she descended lower\r\ninto the basement, where the family lives, sleeps, and cooks our food.\r\n\r\nAt length, hearing the door open, I ejaculated, \"the Lord be praised,\"\r\nrushed down, entered the bath-room and secured it from further\r\nintruders. I observed that Miss ---- senior had been bathing her members,\r\nand that the bath, tho' empty, was covered inside with patches of soap\r\n--unutterably black! Oh! Miss ----!\r\n\r\nDressed leisurely and breakfasted. When the table was cleared wrote a\r\nportion of my essay on _Spallanzani_....\r\n\r\nThen, being giddy and tired, rang for dinner. Miss ---- laid the table.\r\nShe looked very clean. I said, \"Good-morning,\" and she suitably replied,\r\nand I went on reading, the _Winning Post_. Felt too slack to be amiable.\r\nNext time she came in, I said as pleasantly as I could, \"Is it all\r\nready?\" and being informed proceeded to eat forthwith.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, took a 'bus to Richmond. No room outside, so had to go\r\ninside--curse--and sit opposite a row--curse again--of fat, ugly,\r\nelderly women, all off to visit their married daughters, the usual\r\nSunday jaunt. At Hammersmith got on the outside, and at Turnham Green\r\nwas caught in a hail storm. Very cold all of a sudden, so got off and\r\ntook shelter in the doorway of a shop, which was of course closed, the\r\nday being Sunday. Rain, wind, and hail continued for some while, as I\r\ngazed at the wet, almost empty street, thinking, re-thinking and\r\nthinking over again the same thought, viz., that the 'bus ride along\r\nthis route was exceptionally cheap--probably because of competition with\r\nthe trams.\r\n\r\nThe next 'bus took me to Richmond. Two young girls sat in front, and\r\nkept looking back to know if I was \"game.\" I looked _through_ them.\r\nWalked in the Park just conscious of the singing of Larks and the\r\nchatter of Jays, but harassed mentally by the question, \"To whom shall I\r\nsend my essay, when finished?\" To shelter from the rain sat under an oak\r\nwhere four youths joined me and said, \"Worse luck,\" and \"Not half,\" and\r\nsmoked cigarettes. They gossipped and giggled like girls, put their arms\r\naround each other's necks. At the dinner last night, they said, they had\r\nDuck and Tomato Soup and Beeswax (\"Beesley, you know, the chap that goes\r\nabout with Smith a lot\") wore a fancy waistcoat with a dinner jacket.\r\nWhen I got up to move on, they became convulsed with laughter. I\r\nscowled.\r\n\r\nHad tea in the Pagoda tea-rooms, dry toast and brown bread and butter.\r\nTwo young men opposite me were quietly playing the fool.\r\n\r\n\"Hold my hand,\" one said audibly enough for two lovers to hear,\r\ncomfortably settled up in a corner. Even at a side view I could see them\r\nkissing each other in between mouthfuls of bread and butter and jam.\r\n\r\nOn rising to go, one of the two hilarious youths removed my cap and\r\nplayfully placed it on top of the bowler which his friend was wearing.\r\n\r\n\"My cap, I think,\" I said sharply, and the young man apologised with a\r\nsplutter. I glared like a kill-joy of sixty.\r\n\r\nOn the 'bus, coming home, thro' streets full of motor traffic and all\r\navailable space plastered with advertisements that screamed at you, I\r\nespied in front three pretty girls, who gave me the \"Glad Eye.\" One had\r\na deep, musical voice, and kept on using it, one of the others a pretty\r\nankle and kept on showing it.\r\n\r\nAt Kew, two Italians came aboard, one of whom went out of his way to sit\r\namong the girls. He sat level with them, and kept turning his head\r\naround, giving them a sweeping glance as he did so, to shout remarks in\r\nItalian to his friend behind. He thought the girls were prostitutes, I\r\nthink, and he may have been right. I was on the seat behind this man and\r\nfor want of anything better to do, studied his face minutely. In short,\r\nit was fat, round, and greasy. He wore black moustachios with curly\r\nends, his eyes were dark shining, bulgy, and around his neck was wrapped\r\na scarf inside a dirty linen collar, as if he had a sore throat. I sat\r\nbehind him and hated him steadily, perseveringly.\r\n\r\nAt Hammersmith the three girls got off, and the bulgy-eyed Italian\r\nwatched them go with lascivious eyes, looking over the rail and down at\r\nthem on the pavement--still interested. I looked down too. They crossed\r\nthe road in front of us and disappeared.\r\n\r\nCame home and here I am writing this. This is the content of to-day's\r\nconsciousness. This is about all I have thought, said, or done, or felt.\r\nA stagnant day!\r\n\r\n_March_ 26.\r\n\r\nHome with a bad influenza cold. In a deplorable condition. The best I\r\ncould do was to sit by the fire and read newspapers one by one from the\r\nfirst page to the last till the reading became mechanical. I found\r\nmyself reading an account of the Lincoln Handicap and a column article\r\non Kleptomania, while advertisements of new books were devoured with\r\nrelish as delicacies. My mind became a morass of current Divorce Court\r\nNews, Society Gossip--\"if Sir A. goes Romeward, if Miss B. sings\r\ntrue\"--and advertisements. I went on reading because I was afraid to be\r\nalone with myself.\r\n\r\nB---- arrived at tea and after saying he felt very \"pin-eyed\" swallowed\r\na glass of Bols gin--the Gin of Antony Bols--and recovered sufficiently\r\nto inform me delightedly that he had just won £50. He told me all the\r\nstory; meanwhile, I, tired of wiping and blowing my nose, sat in the\r\ndirty armchair hunched up with elbows on knees and let it drip on to the\r\ndirty carpet. B----, of course, noticed nothing, which was fortunate.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of damned fool would have been kindly and sympathetic. I must\r\nsay I like old B----. I like him for his simpleness and utter absence of\r\nself-consciousness, which make him as charming as a child. Moreover, he\r\noften makes me a present of invaluable turf tips. Of course, he is a\r\nliar, but his lies are harmless and on his mouth like milk on an\r\ninfant's. My own lies are much more dangerous. And when you are ill, to\r\nbe treated as tho' you were well is good for hypochondriacs.\r\n\r\n_April_ 15.\r\n\r\nH----'s wedding. Five minutes before time, I am told I made a dramatic\r\nentry into the church clad in an audaciously light pair of Cashmere\r\ntrousers, lemon-coloured gloves, with top hat and cane. The latter\r\nupset the respectability frightfully--it is not _comme il faut_.\r\n\r\n_April_ 16.\r\n\r\n... If I am to admit the facts they are that I eagerly anticipate love,\r\nlook everywhere for it, long for it, am unhappy without it. She\r\nfascinates me--admitted. I could, if I would, surrender myself. Her\r\naffection makes me long to do it. I am sick of living by myself. I am\r\nfrightened of myself. My life is miserable alone, and sometimes\r\ndesperately miserable when I long for a little sympathy to be close at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nI have often tried to persuade R---- to share a flat with me, because I\r\ndon't really wish to marry. I struggle against the idea, I am egotist\r\nenough to wish to shirk the responsibilities.\r\n\r\nBut then I am a ridiculously romantic creature with a wonderful ideal of\r\na woman I shall never meet or if I do she won't want me--\"that (wholly)\r\nimpossible She.\" R---- in a flat with me would partly solve my\r\ndifficulties. I don't love her enough for marriage. Mine must be a grand\r\npassion, a _bouleversement_--for I am capable of it.\r\n\r\n_April_ 17.\r\n\r\n_A Humble Confession_\r\n\r\nThe Hon. ----, son and heir of Lord ----, to-day invited me to lunch\r\nwith him in ---- Square. He's a handsome youth of twenty-five, with fair\r\nhair and blue eyes.... and O! such an aristocrat. Good Lord.\r\n\r\nBut to continue: the receipt of so unexpected an invitation from so\r\nglorious a young gentleman at first gave me palpitation of the heart. I\r\nwas so surprised that I scarcely had enough presence of mind to listen\r\nto the rest of his remarks and later, it was only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that I could recall the place where we arranged to meet. His\r\nremarks, too, are not easy to follow, as he talks in a stenographic,\r\nAlfred-Jingle-like manner, jerking out disjected members of sentences,\r\nand leaving you to make the best of them or else to Hell with you--by\r\nthe Lord, I speak English, don't I? If I said, \"I beg your pardon,\" he\r\njerked again, and left me often equally unenlightened.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at his home, the first thing he did was to shout down the\r\nstairs to the basement: \"Elsie, Elsie,\" while I gazed with awe at a\r\nparcel on the hall table addressed to \"Lord ----.\" Before lunch we sat\r\nin his little room and talked about ----, but I was still quite unable\r\nto regain my self-composure. I couldn't for the life of me forget that\r\nhere was I lunching with Lord ----'s son, on equal terms, with mutual\r\ninterests, that his sisters perhaps would come in directly or even the\r\nnoble Lord himself. I felt like a scared hare. How should I address a\r\npeer of the realm? I kept trying to remember and every now and then for\r\nsome unaccountable reason my mind travelled into ----shire and I saw\r\nAuntie C---- serving out tea and sugar over the counter of the baker's\r\nshop in the little village. I luxuriated in the contrast, tho' I am not\r\nat all inclined to be a snob.\r\n\r\nHe next offered me a cigarette, which I took and lit. It was a Turkish\r\ncigarette with one end plugged up with cotton-wool--to absorb the\r\nnicotine--a, thing I've never seen before. I was so flurried at the time\r\nthat I did not notice this and lit the wrong end. With perfect ease and\r\nself-possession, the Honourable One pointed out my error to me and told\r\nme to throw the cigarette away and have another.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had completely lost my nerve. My pride, chagrin,\r\nexcessive self-consciousness were entangling all my movements in the\r\nmeshes of a net. Failing to tumble to the situation, I inquired, \"Why\r\nthe _wrong_ end? Is there a right and a wrong end?\" Lord ----'s son and\r\nheir pointed out the cotton-wool end, now blackened by my match.\r\n\r\n\"That didn't burn very well, did it?\"\r\n\r\nI was bound to confess that it did not, and threw the smoke away under\r\nthe impression that these wonderful cigarettes with right and wrong ends\r\nmust be some special brand sold only to aristocrats, and at a great\r\nprice, and possessing some secret virtue. Once again, handsome Mr. ----\r\ndrew out his silver cigarette-case, selected a second cigarette for me,\r\nand held it towards me between his long delicate fingers, at the same\r\ntime pointing out the plug at one end and making a few staccato remarks\r\nwhich I could not catch.\r\n\r\nI was still too scared to be in full possession of my faculties, and he\r\napparently was too tired to be explicit to a member of the bourgeoisie,\r\nstumbling about his drawing-room. The cotton-wool plug only suggested to\r\nme some sort of a plot on the part of a dissolute scion of a noble house\r\nto lure me into one of his bad habits, such as smoking opium or taking\r\nveronal. I again prepared to light the cigarette at the wrong end.\r\n\r\n\"Try the other end,\" repeated the young man, smiling blandly. I blushed,\r\nand immediately recovered my balance, and even related my knowledge of\r\npipes fitted to carry similar plugs....\r\n\r\nDuring lunch (at which we sat alone) after sundry visits to the top of\r\nthe stairs to shout down to the kitchen, he announced that he thought it\r\nwasn't last night's affair after all which was annoying the Cook (he got\r\nhome late without a latch-key)--it was because he called her \"Cook\"\r\ninstead of Mrs. Austin. He smiled serenely and decided to indulge Mrs.\r\nA., his indulgent attitude betraying an objectionable satisfaction with\r\nthe security of his own unassailable social status. There was a trace of\r\ngratification at the little compliment secreted in the Cook's annoyance.\r\nShe wanted Mr. Charles to call her Mrs. Austin, forsooth. Very well! and\r\nhe smiled down on the little weakness _de haute en bas_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this little experience. Turning it over in my mind (as the\r\nhousemaid says when she decides to stay on) I have come to the\r\nconclusion that the social parvenu is not such a vulgar fellow after\r\nall. He may be a bore--particularly if he sits with his finger tips\r\napposed over a spherical paunch, festooned with a gold chain, and keeps\r\non relating _in extenso_ how once he gummed labels on blacking bottles.\r\nOften enough he is a smug fellow, yet, truth to tell, we all feel a\r\nlittle interested in him. He is a traveller from an antique land, and we\r\nsometimes like to listen to his tales of adventure and all he has come\r\nthrough. He has traversed large territories of human experience, he has\r\nmet strange folk and lodged in strange caravanserai. Similarly with the\r\nman who has come down in the world--the fool, the drunkard, the\r\nembezzler--he may bore us with his maudlin sympathy with himself yet his\r\nstories hold us. It must be a fine experience within the limits of a\r\nsingle life to traverse the whole keyboard of our social status, whether\r\nup or down. I should like to be a peer who grinds a barrel organ or\r\n(better still) a one-time organ-grinder who now lives in Park Lane. It\r\nmust be very dull to remain stationary--once a peer always a peer.\r\n\r\n_April_ 20.\r\n\r\nMiss ---- heard me sigh to-day and asked what it might mean. \"Only the\r\nsparks flying upward,\" I answered lugubriously.\r\n\r\nA blackguard is often unconscious of a good deal of his wickedness.\r\nCharge him with wickedness and he will deny it quite honestly--honest\r\nthen, perhaps, for the first time in his life.\r\n\r\nAn Entomologist is a large hairy man with eyebrows like antennæ.\r\n\r\nChronic constipation has gained for me an unrivalled knowledge of all\r\nlaxatives, aperients, purgatives and cathartic compounds. At present I\r\narrange two gunpowder plots a week. It's abominable. Best literature for\r\nthe latrine: picture puzzles.\r\n\r\n_April_ 23.\r\n\r\n_A Foolish Bird_\r\n\r\nWith a menacing politeness, B---- to-day inquired of a fat curate who\r\nwas occupying more than his fair share of a seat on top of a 'bus,--\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to get up or stay where ye are, sir?\"\r\n\r\nThe foolish bird was sitting nearly on top of B----, mistaking a bomb\r\nfor an egg.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied the fat curate.\r\n\r\nB---- repeated his inquiry with more emphasis in the hideous Scotch\r\nbrogue.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I shall stay here till I get down presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you will,\" said B----.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the fat one in falsetto indignation.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" B---- grunted, and shunted sideways so that the poor fellow\r\nalmost slid on to the floor.\r\n\r\nA posse of police walking along in single file always makes me laugh. A\r\nsingle constable is a Policeman, but several in single file are\r\n\"Coppers.\" I imagine every one laughs at them and I have a shrewd\r\nsuspicion it is one of W.S. Gilbert's legacies--the _Pirates of\r\nPenzance_ having become part of the national Consciousness.\r\n\r\n_On Lighting Chloe's Cigarette_\r\n\r\nR---- remarked to-day that he intended writing a lyric on lighting\r\nChloe's cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" I said at once appreciative, \"now tell me, do you balance your\r\nhand--by gently (ever so gently) resting the extreme tip of your little\r\nfinger upon her chin, and\" (I was warming up) \"do you hold the match\r\nvertically or horizontally, and do you light it in the dark or in the\r\nlight? If you have finesse, you won't need to be told that the thing is\r\nto get a steady flame and the maximum of illumination upon her face to\r\nlast over a period for as long as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chloe,\" replied R----, \"is wearing now a charming blouse with a\r\ncharming V-shaped opening in front. Her Aunt asked my Mother last night\r\ntentatively, 'How do you like Chloe's blouse? Is it too low?' My Mother\r\nscrutinised the dear little furry, lop-eared thing and answered\r\ndoubtfully, 'No, Maria, I don't think so.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How ridiculous! Why the V is a positive signpost. My dear fellow,\" I\r\nsaid to R----, \"I should refuse to be bluffed by those old women. Tell\r\nthem you _know_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarlyle called Lamb a despicable abortion. What a crime!\r\n\r\n_May_ 2.\r\n\r\nDeveloped a savage fit. Up to a certain point, perhaps, but beyond that\r\nanxiety changes into recklessness--you simply don't care. The aperients\r\nare causing dyspepsia and intermittent action of the heart, which\r\nfrightens me. After a terrifying week, during which at crises I have\r\nfelt like dropping suddenly in the street, in the gardens, anywhere,\r\nfrom syncope, I rebelled against this humiliating fear. I pulled my\r\nshoulders back and walked briskly ahead along the street with a dropped\r\nbeat every two or three steps. I laughed bitterly at it and felt it\r\ncould stop or go on--I was at last indifferent. In a photographer's shop\r\nwas the picture of a very beautiful woman and I stopped to look at her.\r\nI glowered in thro' the glass angrily and reflected how she was gazing\r\nout with that same expression even at the butcher's boy or the\r\nlamp-lighter. It embittered me to think of having to leave her to some\r\nother man. To me she represented all the joy of life which at any moment\r\nI might have had to quit for ever. Such impotence enraged me and I\r\nwalked off up the street with a whirling heart and the thought, \"I shall\r\ndrop, I suppose, when I get up as far as that.\" Yet don't think I was\r\nalarmed. Oh! no. The iron had entered me, and I went on with cynical\r\nindifference waiting to be struck down.\r\n\r\n... She is a very great deal to me. Perhaps I love her very much after\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_May_ 3.\r\n\r\nBad heart attack all day. Intermittency is very refined torture to one\r\nwho wants to live very badly. Your pump goes a \"dot and carry one,\" or\r\nsay \"misses a stitch,\" what time you breathe deep, begin to shake your\r\nfriend's hand and make a farewell speech. Then it goes on again and you\r\norder another pint of beer.\r\n\r\nIt is a fractious animal within the cage of my thorax, and I never know\r\nwhen it is going to escape and make off with my precious life between\r\nits teeth. I humour and coax and soothe it, but, God wot, I haven't much\r\nconfidence in the little beast. My thorax it appears is an intolerable\r\nkennel.\r\n\r\n_May_ 10.\r\n\r\nIn a very cheerful mood. Pleased with myself and everybody till a\r\nseagull soared overhead in Kensington Gardens and aroused my vast\r\ncapacities for envy--I wish I could fly.\r\n\r\n_May_ 24.\r\n\r\nIn L---- with my brother, A----. The great man is in great form and very\r\nhappy in his love for N----. He is a most delightful creature and I love\r\nhim more than any one else in the wide world. There is an almost\r\nfeminine tenderness in my love.\r\n\r\nWe spent a delightful day, talking and arguing and insulting one\r\nanother.... At these seances we take delight in anaesthetising our\r\nhearts for the purposes of argument, and a third person would be bound\r\nto suppose we were in the throes of a bitter quarrel. We pile up one\r\nvindictive remark on another, ingeniously seeking out--and with\r\nmalice--weak points in each other's armour, which previous exchange of\r\nconfidences makes it easy to find. Neither of us hesitates to make use\r\nof such private confessions, yet our love is so strong that we can\r\nafford to take any liberty. There is, in fact, a fearful joy in testing\r\nthe strength of our affection by searching for cutting rejoinders--to\r\nsee the effect. We rig up one another's cherished ideals like Aunt\r\nSallies and then knock them down, we wax sarcastic, satirical,\r\ncontemptuous in turn, we wave our hands animatedly (hand-waving is a\r\ngreat trick with both of us), get flushed, point with our fingers, and\r\nthump the table to clinch some bit of repartee. Yet it's all smoke. Our\r\nlove is unassailable--it's like the law of gravitation, you cannot\r\ndispute it, it underlies our existence, it is the air we breathe.\r\n\r\nN---- is charming, and thought we were quarrelling, and therefore\r\nintervened on his side!\r\n\r\n_May_ 31.\r\n\r\nR---- outlined an impression he had in Naples one day during a sirocco\r\nof the imminence of his own death. It was evidently an isolated\r\nexperience and bored me a little as I could have said a lot myself about\r\nthat. When he finished I drew from my pocket an envelope with my name\r\nand three addresses scribbled on it to help the police in case of\r\nsyncope as I explained. I have carried this with me for several years\r\nand at one time a flask of brandy.\r\n\r\n_June_ 3.\r\n\r\nWent to see the Irish Players in _The Playboy_. Sitting in front of me\r\nwas a charming little Irish girl accompanied by a male clod with\r\nred-rimmed eyes like a Bull-terrier's, a sandy, bristly moustache like a\r\nhousemaid's broom, and a face like a gluteal mass, and a horrid voice\r\nthat crepitated rather than spoke.\r\n\r\nShe was dark, with shining blue eyes, and a delightful little nose of\r\nthe utmost import to every male who should gaze upon her. Between the\r\nacts, the clod hearkened to her vivacious conversation--like an\r\nenchanted bullock. Her vivacity was such that the tip of her nose moved\r\nup and down for emphasis and by the end of the Third Act I was captured\r\nentirely. Lucky dog, that clod!\r\n\r\nAfter the play this little Irish maiden caught my eye and it became a\r\nphysical impossibility for me to check a smile--and oh! Heavens!--she\r\ngave me a smile in return. Precisely five seconds later, she looked\r\nagain to see if I was still smiling--I was--and we then smiled broadly\r\nand openly on one another--her smile being the timorous ingénue's not\r\nthe glad eye of a _femme de joie_. Later, on the railway platform\r\nwhither I followed her, I caught her eye again (was ever so lucky a\r\nfellow?), and we got into the same carriage. But so did the clod--ah!\r\ndear, was ever so unlucky a fellow? Forced to occupy a seat some way\r\noff, but she caught me trying to see her thro' a midnight forest of\r\nopera hats, lace ruffles, projecting ears and fat noses.\r\n\r\nCurse! Left her at High Street Station and probably will never see her\r\nagain. This is a second great opportunity. The first was the girl on\r\nLundy Island. These two women I shall always regret. There must be so\r\nmany delightful and interesting persons in London if only I could get at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_June_ 4.\r\n\r\nRushed off to tell R---- about my little Irish girl. Her face has been\r\n\"shadowing\" me all day.\r\n\r\n_June_ 6.\r\n\r\nA violent argument with R---- _re_ marriage. He says Love means\r\nappropriation, and is taking the most elaborate precautions to forfend\r\npassion--just as if it were a militant suffragette. Every woman he meets\r\nhe first puts into a long quarantine, lest perchance she carries the\r\ngerm of the infectious disease. He quotes Hippolytus and talks like a\r\nmediæval ascetic. Himself, I imagine, he regards as a valuable but\r\nbrittle piece of Dresden china which must be saved from rough handling\r\nand left unmolested to pursue its high and dusty destiny--an old crock\r\nas I warned him. By refusing to plunge into life he will live long and\r\nbe a well preserved man, but scarcely a living man--a mummy rather. I\r\ntold him so amid much laughter.\r\n\r\n\"You're a reactionary,\" says he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but why should a reactionary be a naughty boy?\"\r\n\r\n_June_ 7.\r\n\r\nMy ironical fate lured me this evening into another discussion on\r\nmarriage in which I had to take up a position exactly opposite to the\r\none I defended yesterday against R----. In fact, I actually subverted to\r\nmy own pressing requirements some of R----'s own arguments! The\r\nargument, of course, was with Her.\r\n\r\nMarriage, I urged, was an economic trap for guileless young men, and for\r\nmy part (to give myself some necessary stiffening) I did not intend to\r\nenter upon any such hazardous course, even if I had the chance. Miss\r\n---- said I was a funk--to me who the day before had been hammering\r\ninto R---- my principle of \"Plunge and damn the consequences.\" I was\r\ninformed I was an old woman afraid to go out without an umbrella, an old\r\ntabby cat afraid to leave the kitchen fire, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I _am_ afraid to go out without an umbrella,\" I argued formally,\r\n\"when it's raining cats and dogs. As long as I am dry, I shall keep dry.\r\nAs soon as I find myself caught in the rain or victimised by a passion,\r\nI shan't be afraid of falling in love or getting wet. It would be a\r\nmisadventure, but I am not going in search of one.\"\r\n\r\nAll the same the discussion was very galling, for I was acting a part.\r\n\r\n... The truth is I have philandered abominably with her. I know it. And\r\nnow I am jibbing at the idea of marriage.... I am such an egotist, I\r\nwant, I believe, a Princess of the Blood Royal.\r\n\r\n_June_ 9.\r\n\r\nSome days ago sent a personal advertisement to the newspaper to try to\r\nfind my little Irish girl who lives at Notting Hill Gate. To-day they\r\nreturn me the money and advert, no doubt mistaking me for a White Slave\r\ntrafficker. And by this time, I'm thinking, my little Irish girl can go\r\nto blazes. Shall spend the P.O. on sweets or monkey nuts.\r\n\r\n_June_ 10\r\n\r\n_Lupus_\r\n\r\nIt is raining heavily. I have just finished dinner. In the street an\r\nitinerant musician is singing dolefully, \"O Rest in the Lord.\" In my\r\ndirty little sitting room I begin to feel very restless, so put on my\r\nhat and cloak and walk down towards the Station for a paper to read. It\r\nis all very dark and dismal, and I gaze with hungry eyes in thro' some\r\nof the windows disclosing happy comfortable interiors. At intervals\r\nthunder growls and lightning brightens up the deserted dirtiness of the\r\nStation Waiting Room. A few bits of desolate paper lie about on the\r\nfloor, and up in one corner on a form a crossing-sweeper, motionless and\r\nabject, driven in from his pitch by the rain. His hands are deep in his\r\ntrousers' pockets, and the poor devil lies with legs sprawling out and\r\neyes closed: over the lower part of his face he wears a black mask to\r\nhide the ravages of lupus.... He seemed the last man on earth--after\r\nevery one else had died of the plague. Not a soul in the station. Not a\r\ntrain. And this is June!\r\n\r\n_June_ 15.\r\n\r\n_Measuring Lice_\r\n\r\nSpent the day measuring the legs and antennæ of lice to two places of\r\ndecimals!\r\n\r\nTo the lay mind how fantastic this must seem! Indeed, I hope it is\r\nfantastic. I do not mind being thought odd. It seems almost fitting that\r\nan incurable dilettante like myself should earn his livelihood by\r\nmeasuring the legs of lice. I like to believe that such a bizarre manner\r\nof life suits my incurable frivolousness.\r\n\r\nI am a Magpie in a Bagdad bazaar, hopping about, useless, inquisitive,\r\nfascinated by a lot of astonishing things: _e.g._, a book on the\r\nquadrature of the circle, the _gabbertushed fustilugs_ passage in\r\nBurton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_, names like Mr. Portwine or Mr.\r\nHogsflesh, Tweezer's Alley or Pickle Herring Street, the excellent,\r\nconceitful sonnets of Henry Constable or Petticoat Lane on a Sunday\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nColossal things such as Art, Science, etc., frighten me. I am afraid I\r\nshould develop a thirst that would make me wish to drink the sea dry. My\r\nmind is a disordered miscellany. The world is too distracting. I cannot\r\napply myself for long. London bewilders me. At times it is a\r\nphantasmagoria, an opium dream out of De Quincey.\r\n\r\n_June_ 17.\r\n\r\nProf. Geo. Saintsbury's book on Elizabethan literature amuses me.\r\n_George_, there can be no doubt, is a very refined, cultivated fellow. I\r\nbet he don't eat periwinkles with a pin or bite his nails--and you\r\nshould hear him refer to folk who can't read Homer in the original or\r\nwho haven't been to Oxford--to Merton above all. He also says _non so\r\nche_ for _je ne sais quoi_.\r\n\r\n_June_ 26.\r\n\r\n... I placed the volume on the mantelpiece as if it were a bottle of\r\nphysic straight from my Dispensary, and I began to expostulate and\r\nexpound, as if she were a sick person and I the doctor.... She seemed a\r\nlittle nettled at my proselytising demeanour and gave herself out to be\r\nvery preoccupied--or at any rate quite uninterested in my physic. I read\r\nthe book last night at one sitting and was boiling over with it.\r\n\r\n\"I fear I have come at an inconvenient time,\" I said, with a sardonic\r\nsmile and strummed on the piano.... \"I must really be off. Please read\r\nit (which sounded like 'three times a day after meals') and tell me how\r\nyou like it. (Facetiously.) Of course don't give up your present manual\r\nfor it, that would be foolish and unnecessary.\" ... I rambled\r\non--disposed to be very playful.\r\n\r\nAt last calmly and horribly, in a thoughtful voice she answered,--\r\n\r\n\"I think you are very rude; you play the piano after I asked you to\r\nstop and walk about just as if it were your own home.\"\r\n\r\nI remained outwardly calm but inwardly was very surprised and full of\r\ntremors. I said after a pause,--\r\n\r\n\"Very well, if you think so.... Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer; and I was too proud to apologise.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" I repeated.\r\n\r\nShe went on reading her novel in silence while I got as far as the\r\ndoor--very upset.\r\n\r\n\"_Au revoir_.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said I, and went out of the room leaving my lady for good and all\r\nand I'm not sorry.\r\n\r\nIn the passage met Miss ----. \"What?\" she said, \"going already?\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell,\" I said sepulchrally. \"A very tragic farewell,\" which left\r\nher wondering.\r\n\r\n_June_ 29.\r\n\r\n_At the Albert Hall_\r\n\r\nWent with R---- to the Albert Hall to the _Empress of Ireland_ Memorial\r\nConcert with massed bands. We heard the Symphonie Pathétique, Chopin's\r\nFuneral March, Trauermarsch from Götterdammerung, the Ride of the\r\nValkyries and a solemn melody from Bach.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I regard as a mountain peak in my existence. For two\r\nsolid hours I sat like an Eagle on a rock gazing into infinity--a very\r\nfine sensation for a London Sparrow....\r\n\r\nI have an idea that if it were possible to assemble the sick and\r\nsuffering day by day in the Albert Hall and keep the Orchestra going all\r\nthe time, then the constant exposure of sick parts to such heavenly air\r\nvibrations would ultimately restore to them the lost rhythm of health.\r\nSurely, even a single exposure to--say Beethoven's Fifth Symphony--must\r\nresult in some permanent reconstitution of ourselves body and soul. No\r\none can be quite the same after a Beethoven Symphony has streamed thro'\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIf one could _develop_ a human soul like a negative the effect I should\r\nsay could be seen.... I'll tell you what I wish they'd do--seriously:\r\ndivide up the arena into a series of cubicles where, unobserved and in\r\nperfect privacy, a man could execute all the various movements of his\r\nbody and limbs which the music prompts. It would be such a delicious\r\nself-indulgence and it's torture to be jammed into a seat where you\r\ncan't even tap one foot or wave an arm.\r\n\r\nThe concert restored my moral health. I came away in love with people I\r\nwas hating before and full of compassion for others I usually condemn. A\r\nfeeling of immeasurable well being--a jolly bonhomie enveloped me like\r\nincandescent light. At the close when we stood up to sing the National\r\nAnthem we all felt a genuine spirit of camaraderie. Just as when Kings\r\ndie, we were silent musing upon the common fate, and when the time came\r\nto separate we were loath to go our several ways, for we were comrades\r\nwho together had come thro' a great experience. For my part I wanted to\r\nshake hands all round--happy travellers, now alas! at the journey's end\r\nand never perhaps to meet again--never.\r\n\r\nR---- and I walked up thro' Kensington Gardens like two young Gods!\r\n\r\n\"I even like that bloody thing,\" I said, pointing to the Albert\r\nMemorial.\r\n\r\nWe pointed out pretty girls to one another, watched the children play\r\nring-a-ring-a-roses on the grass. We laughed exultingly at the thought\r\nof our dismal colleagues ... tho' I said (as before!) I loved 'em\r\nall--God bless 'em--even old ----. R---- said it was nothing short of\r\ninsolence on their part to have neglected the opportunity of coming to\r\nthe Concert.\r\n\r\nLater on, an old gaffer up from the country stopped us to ask the way to\r\nRotten Row--I overwhelmed him with directions and happy descriptive\r\ndetails. I felt like walking with him and showing him what a wonderful\r\nplace the world is.\r\n\r\nAfter separating from R---- very reluctantly--it was horrible to be left\r\nalone in such high spirits, walked up towards the Round Pond, and caught\r\nmyself avoiding the shadows of the trees--so as to be every moment out\r\nin the blazing sun. I scoffed inwardly at the timorousness of pale,\r\nanæmic folk whom I passed hiding in the shadows of the elms.\r\n\r\nAt the Round Pond, came across a Bulldog who was biting out great chunks\r\nof water and in luxuriant waste-fulness letting it drool out again from\r\neach corner of his mouth. I watched this old fellow greedily (it was\r\nvery hot), as well pleased with him and his liquid \"chops\" as with\r\nanything I saw, unless it were a girl and a man lying full length along\r\nthe grass and kissing beneath a sunshade. I smiled; she saw me, and\r\nsmiled, too, in return, and then fell to kissing again.\r\n\r\n_June_ 30.\r\n\r\n_Dinosaurs_\r\n\r\nThere are books which are Dinosaurs--Sir Walter Raleigh's _History of\r\nthe World_, Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_. There are\r\nmen who are Dinosaurs--Balzac completing his Human Comedy, Napoleon,\r\nRoosevelt. I like them all. I like express trains and motor lorries. I\r\nenjoy watching an iron girder swinging in the air or great cubes of ice\r\ncaught up between iron pincers. I must always stop and watch these\r\nthings. I like everything that is swift or immense: London, lightning,\r\nPopocatepetl. I enjoy the smell of tar, of coal, of fried fish, or a\r\nbrass band playing a Liszt Rhapsody. And why should those foolish Mænads\r\nshout Women's Rights just because they burn down a church? All bonfires\r\nare delectable. Civilisation and top hats bore me. My own life is like a\r\ntame rabbit's. If only I had a long tail to lash it in feline rage! I\r\nwould return to Nature--I could almost return to Chaos. There are times\r\nwhen I feel so dour I would wreck the universe if I could.[1]\r\n\r\n(1917: I think after three years of Armageddon I feel quite ready to go\r\nback to top hats and civilisation.)\r\n\r\n_July_ 8.\r\n\r\n_Sunset in Kensington Gardens_\r\n\r\nThe instinct for worship occurs rhythmically--at morning and evening.\r\nThis is natural, for twice a day at sunrise and sunset--however\r\nwork-sodden we may be, however hypnotised by daily routine--our natural\r\nimpulse is (provided we are awake) to look to the horizon at the sun and\r\nstand a moment with mute lips. During the course of the day or night, we\r\nare too occupied or asleep--but sunrise is the great hour of the\r\ndeparture and sunset is the arrival at the end. Everything puts on a\r\nmysterious appearance--to-night the tops of the elms seemed\r\nsuper-naturally high and, pushing up into the sky, had secret communion\r\nwith the clouds; the clouds seemed waiting for a ceremony, a way had\r\nbeen prepared by the tapissier, a moment of suspense while one cloud\r\nstretched to another like courtiers in whispered conversation; a rumour\r\nof the approach; then slowly the news came thro' that the sun had\r\narrived for immediate departure.\r\n\r\n_July_ 14.\r\n\r\nHave finished my essay. But am written out--obviously. To-night I\r\nstruggled with another, and spent two hours sucking the end of my pen.\r\nBut after painfully mountainous parturition, all I brought forth were\r\nthe two ridiculous mice of one meretricious trope and one grammatical\r\nsolecism. I can sometimes sit before a sheet of paper, pen in hand,\r\nunable to produce a word.\r\n\r\n_July_ 19.\r\n\r\nFor a walk with R---- in the country, calling for tea at his Uncle's\r\nhouse at ----. Played clock golf and made the acquaintance of Miss ----,\r\na tall, statuesque lady, with golden hair, as graceful as an antelope\r\nand very comely, her two dear little feet clad in white shoes peeping\r\nout (as R---- said) like two white mice one after the other as she\r\nmoved across the lawn.\r\n\r\nComing home I said to R---- histrionically, \"Some golden-haired little\r\nboy will some day rest his head upon her bosom, beautiful in line and\r\ndepth, all unconscious of his luck or of his part in a beautiful\r\npicture--would that I were the father to make that group a _fait\r\naccompli._\" R----, with meticulous accuracy, always refers to her as\r\n\"that elegant virgin.\"\r\n\r\n_July_ 25.\r\n\r\nWhile sketching under Hammersmith Bridge yesterday, R---- heard a\r\nwhistle, and, looking up, saw a charming \"young thing\" leaning over the\r\nBridge parapet smiling like the blessed Damozel out of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\"Come down,\" he cried.\r\n\r\nShe did, and they discussed pictures while he painted. Later he walked\r\nwith her to the Broadway, saw her into a 'bus and said \"Good-bye,\"\r\nwithout so much as an exchange of names.\r\n\r\n\"Even if she _were_ a whore,\" I said, \"it's a pity your curiosity was so\r\nsluggish. You should have seen her home, even if you did not go home\r\nwith her. Young man, you preferred to let go of authentic life at\r\nHammersmith Broadway, so as to return at once to your precious\r\nwater-colour painting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" replied he enigmatically.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you do, if ever you meet her again,\" I rejoined, \"don't\r\nintroduce her to that abominable ----. He is abominably handsome, and I\r\nhate him for it. To all his other distinctions he is welcome--parentage,\r\nmoney, success, but I can never forgive him his good looks and the\r\ninevitable marriage to some beautiful fair-skinned woman.\"\r\n\r\nR. (reflectively): \"Up to now, I was inclined to think that envy as a\r\n_passion_ did not exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you none?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" he answered, and I believe it.\r\n\r\n\"Smug wretch, then. All I can say is, I may have instincts and passions\r\nbut I am not a pale water-colour artist.... What's the matter with you,\"\r\nI foamed, \"is that you like pictures. If I showed you a real woman, you\r\nwould exclaim contemplatively, 'How lovely;' then putting out one hand\r\nto touch her, unsuspectingly, you'd scream aghast, 'Oh! it's alive, I\r\nhear it ticking.' 'Yes, my boy,' I answer severely with a flourish,\r\n'_That_ is a woman's heart.'\"\r\n\r\nR---- exploded with laughter and then said, \"A truce to your desire for\r\nmore life, for actual men and women. ... I know this that last night I\r\nwould not have exchanged the quiet armchair reading the last chapter of\r\nDostoieffsky's _The Possessed_ for a Balaclava Charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"A matter of temperament, I suppose,\" I reflected, in cold detachment.\r\n\"You see, I belong to the raw meat school. _You_ prefer life cooked for\r\nyou in a book. You prefer the confectioner's shop to cutting down the\r\nwheat with your own scythe.\"\r\n\r\n_July_ 26.\r\n\r\nThe B.M. is a ghastly hole. They will give me none of the apparatus I\r\nrequire. If you ask the Trustees for a thousand pounds for the\r\npropagation of the Gospel in foreign parts they say, \"Yes.\" If you ask\r\nfor twenty pounds for a new microscope they say, \"No, but we'll cut off\r\nyour nose with a big pair of scissors.\"\r\n\r\n_July_ 27.\r\n\r\nTo a pedantic prosy little old maid who was working in my room this\r\nmorning, I exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"I'd sooner make a good dissection than go to a Lord Mayor's Banquet.\r\nTurtle Soup ain't in it.\"\r\n\r\nShe was uninspired, and said, \"Oom,\" and went on pinning insects. Then\r\nmore brightly, and with great punctilio in the pronunciation of her\r\nwords, having cleared her throat and drawn herself up with great\r\ndeliberation to deliver herself of a remark, she volunteered,--\r\n\r\n\"I whish I had nevah taken up such a brittle grooop as the Stones\r\n(Stoneflies). One dare not loook at a Stone.\"\r\n\r\nPoor dear little old maid. This was my turn to say \"Oom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty dismal work,\" I added ambiguously. Then with malice aforethought\r\nI whistled a Harry Lauder tune, asked her if she had ever heard Willie\r\nSolar sing, \"You made me love you,\" and then absent-mindedly and in\r\nsuccession inquired,--\r\n\r\n\"What's become of all the gold?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's become of Waring?\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I sing when all is sung?\"\r\n\r\nTo which several categorical interrogations she ventured no reply, but\r\npresently in the usual voice,--\r\n\r\n\"I have placed an Agrionine in this drawer for security and, now I want\r\nit, cannot find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Life is like that,\" I said. \"I never can find my Agrionines!\"\r\n\r\n_August_ 1.\r\n\r\nAll Europe is mobilising.\r\n\r\n_August_ 2.\r\n\r\nWill England join in?\r\n\r\n_August_ 12.\r\n\r\nWe all await the result of a battle between two millions of men. The\r\ntension makes me feel physically sick.\r\n\r\n_August_ 21--_August_ 24.\r\n\r\nIn bed with a fever. I never visit the flat now, but her mother kindly\r\ncame over to see me.\r\n\r\n_September_ 25.\r\n\r\n[Living now in rooms alone.]\r\n\r\nI have--since my return from Cornwall--placed all my journals in a\r\nspecially made cabinet. R---- came to dinner and after a glass or so of\r\nBeaune and a cigarette, I open my \"coffin\"[2] (it is a long box with a\r\nbrass handle at each end), and with some show of deliberation select a\r\nvolume to read to him, drawing it from its division with lavish\r\npunctiliousness, and inquiring with an oily voice, \"A little of 1912?\"\r\nas if we were trying wines. R---- grins at the little farce and so\r\nencourages me.\r\n\r\n_September_ 26.\r\n\r\nDoctor's Consulting Rooms--my life has been spent in them! Medical\r\nspecialists--Harley Street men--I have seen four and all to no purpose.\r\nM---- wrote me the other day,--\r\n\r\n\"Come along and see me on Tuesday; some day I dare say we shall find\r\nsomething we can patch.\"\r\n\r\nHe regards me with the most obvious commiseration and always when I come\r\naway after a visit he shakes me warmly by the hand and says, \"Good-bye,\r\nold man, and good luck.\" More luck than the pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nMy life has always been a continuous struggle with ill-health and\r\nambition, and I have mastered neither. I try to reassure myself that\r\nthis accursed ill-health will not affect my career. I keep flogging my\r\nwill in the hope of winning thro' in the end. Yet at the back of my mind\r\nthere is the great improbability that I shall ever live long enough to\r\nrealise myself. For a long time past my hope has simply been to last\r\nlong enough to convince others of what I might have done--had I lived.\r\nThat will be something. But even to do that I will not allow that I have\r\novermuch time. I have never at any time lived with any sense of\r\nsecurity. I have never felt permanently settled in this life--nothing\r\nmore than a shadowy _locum tenens_, a wraith, a festoon of mist likely\r\nto disappear any moment.\r\n\r\nAt times, when I am vividly conscious of the insecurity of my tenure\r\nhere, my desires enter on a mad race to obtain fulfilment before it is\r\ntoo late ... and as fulfilment recedes ambition obsesses me the more. I\r\nam daily occupied in calculating with my ill-health: trying to\r\ncircumvent it, to carry on in spite of all. I conquer each day. Every\r\nweek is a victory. I am always surprised that my health or will has not\r\ncollapsed, that, by Jove! I am still working and still living.\r\n\r\nOne day it looks like appendicitis, another stoppage, another threatened\r\nblindness, or I develop a cough and am menaced with consumption. So I go\r\non in a hurricane of bad dreams. I struggle like Laocoon with the\r\nserpents--the serpents of nervous depression that press around the heart\r\ntighter than I care to admit. I must use every kind of blandishment to\r\nconvince myself that my life and my work are worth while. Frequently I\r\nmust smother and kill (and it calls for prompt action) the shrill voice\r\nthat cries from the tiniest corner of my heart, \"Are you quite sure you\r\nare such an important fellow as you imagine?\" Or I fret over the\r\ncondition of my brain, finding that I forget what I read, I lose in\r\nacuteness of my perceptions. My brain is a tumefaction. But I won't give\r\nin. I go on trying to recollect what I have forgotten, I harry my brain\r\nall day to recall a word or name, I attack other folk importunately. I\r\nwrite things down so as to look them up in reference books--I am always\r\nlooking up the things I remember I have forgotten....\r\n\r\nThere is another struggle, too, that often engrosses all my energies....\r\nIt is a horrible thing that with so large an ambition, so great a love\r\nof life, I should nevertheless court disaster like this. Truly Sir\r\nThomas Browne you say, \"Every man is his own Atropos.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, I lead an unfathomably miserable existence in this dark, gray\r\nstreet, in these drab, dirty rooms--miserable in its emptiness of home,\r\nlove, human society. Now that I never visit the flat, I visit about two\r\nhouses in London--the Doctor's and R----'s Hotel. I walk along the\r\nstreets and stare in the windows of private houses, hungry for a little\r\nsociety. It creates in me a gnawing, rancorous discontent to be seeing\r\npeople everywhere in London--millions of them--and then to realise my\r\nown ridiculously circumscribed knowledge of them. I am passionately\r\neager to have acquaintances, to possess at least a few friends. If I die\r\nto-morrow, how many persons shall I have talked to? or how many men and\r\nwomen shall I have known? A few maiden aunts and one or two old fossils.\r\nI am burning to meet real live men, I have masses of mental stuff I am\r\nanxious to unload. But I am ignorant of people as of countries and live\r\nin celestial isolation.\r\n\r\nThis, I fear, reads like a wail of self-commiseration. But I am trying\r\nto give myself the pleasure of describing myself at this period\r\ntruthfully, to make a bid at least for some posthumous sympathy.\r\nTherefore it shall be told that I who am capable of passionate love am\r\nsexually starved, and endure the pangs of a fiendish solitude in rooms,\r\nwith an ugly landlady's face when ... I despair of ever finding a woman\r\nto _love_. I never meet women of my own class, and am unprepossessing in\r\nappearance and yet I fancy that once my reserve is melted I am not\r\nwithout attractions. \"He grows on you,\" a girl said of me once. But I am\r\nhypercritical and hyperfastidious. I want too much.... I search daily in\r\nthe streets with a starved and hungry look. What a horrible and powerful\r\nand hateful thing this love instinct is! I hate it, hate it, hate it. It\r\nwill not let me rest. I wish I were a eunuch.\r\n\r\n\"There's a beautiful young thing,\" R---- and I say to one another\r\nsardonically, hoping thereby to conceal the canker within.\r\n\r\nI could gnash my teeth and weep in anger--baulked, frustrated as I am at\r\nalmost every turn of life--in my profession, in my literary efforts, and\r\nin my love of man and woman kind. I would utter a whole commination\r\nservice in my present state of mind.\r\n\r\n_October_ 7.\r\n\r\nTo me woman is _the_ wonderful fact of existence. If there be any next\r\nworld and it be as I hope it is, a jolly gossiping place, with people\r\nstanding around the mantelpiece and discussing their earthly\r\nexperiences, I shall thump my fist on the table as my friends turn to me\r\non entering and exclaim in a loud voice, \"WOMAN.\"\r\n\r\n_October_ 11.\r\n\r\nSince I grew up I have wept three times. The first time they were tears\r\nof exasperation. Dad and I were sitting down side by side after a wordy\r\ncombat in which he had remained adamant and I was forced both by\r\nconscience and argument to give in, to relinquish my dissections, and go\r\noff to some inquest on a drowning fatality. The second time was when\r\nMother died, and the third was _to-day._ But I am calm now. To-day they\r\nwere tears of remorse....\r\n\r\nOn occasion bald confession in this Journal is sweet for the soul and\r\nstrengthens it. It gives me a kind of false backbone to communicate my\r\nsecrets: for I am determined that some day some one shall know. If God\r\nreally intervenes in our affairs, here is an opportunity. Let Him save\r\nme. I challenge Him to save me from perishing in this ditch.... It is\r\nnot often I am cornered into praying but I did this morning, for I feel\r\ndefeated this day, and almost inarticulate in my misery.\r\n\r\nNietzsche in a newspaper I read to-day: \"For myself I have felt\r\nexceptionally blest having Hell's phantoms inside me to thrust at in the\r\ndark, internal enemies to dominate till I felt myself an ecstatic\r\nvictor, wrenching at last good triumphant joys thro' the bars of my own\r\nsickness and weakness--joys with which your notions of happiness, poor\r\nsleek smug creatures, cannot compare! You must carry a chaos inside you\r\nto give birth to a dancing star.\"\r\n\r\nBut Nietzsche is no consolation to a man who has once been weak enough\r\nto be brought to his knees. There I am and there I think I have prayed a\r\nlittle somehow to-day. But it's all in desperation, not in faith.\r\nInternal chaos I have, but no dancing star. Dancing stars are the\r\nconsolation of genius.\r\n\r\n_October_ 12.\r\n\r\nAm better to-day. My better self is convinced that it is silly and\r\nsmall-minded to think so much about my own puny destiny--especially at\r\ntimes like these when--God love us all--there is a column of casualties\r\neach day. The great thing to be thankful for is that I am _alive_ and\r\nalive _now_, that I was alive _yesterday_, and even may be to-morrow.\r\nSurely that is thrilling enough. What, then, have I to complain of? I'm\r\na lucky dog to be alive at all. My plight is bad, but there are others\r\nin a worse one. I'm going to be brave and fight on the side of\r\nNietzsche. Who knows but that one day the dancing star may yet be born!\r\n\r\n_October_ 13.\r\n\r\nSpent the evening in my lodgings struggling with my will. Too flabby to\r\nwork, disinclined to read, a dreadful vague unrest possessing me. I\r\ncouldn't sit still in my chair, so walked around the table continuously\r\nlike a squirrel in a cage. I wanted to be going out somewhere, talking\r\nto some one, to be among human beings.\r\n\r\nMany an evening during the past few months, I have got up and gone down\r\nthe road to look across at the windows of the flat, to see if there were\r\na red light behind the curtains, and, if so, wonder if she were there,\r\nand how she was. My pride would never allow me to visit there again on\r\nmy own initiative. K---- has managed to bring about a rapprochement but\r\nI go very seldom. Pride again.\r\n\r\nI wanted to do so to-night. I thought I would just go down the road to\r\nlook up at the windows. That seemed to be some comfort. Why do I wish to\r\ndo this? I do not know. From a mere inspection one would say that I am\r\nin love. But remember I am also ill. Three times to-night I nearly put\r\non my boots and went down to have a look up! What ridiculous weakness!\r\nYet this room can be a frightful prison. Shall I? I cannot decide. I see\r\nher figure constantly before me--gentle, graceful, calm, stretching\r\nforth both hands and to me....\r\n\r\nSeized a pack of cards and played Patience and went on playing Patience\r\nbecause I was afraid to stop. Given a weak constitution, a great\r\nambition, an amorous nature, and at the same time a very fastidious one,\r\nI might have known I was in for trouble.\r\n\r\n_October_ 14.\r\n\r\n_Marie Bashkirtseff_\r\n\r\nSome time ago I noticed a quotation from one, Marie Bashkirtseff in a\r\nbook on Strindberg, and was struck with the likeness to a sentiment of\r\nmy own. Who _are_ you? I wondered.\r\n\r\nThis evening went to the Library and read about her in Mathilde Blind's\r\nintroductory essay to her Journal. I am simply astounded. It would be\r\ndifficult in all the world's history to discover any two persons with\r\ntemperaments so alike. She is the \"very spit of me \"! I devoured\r\nMathilde Blind's pages more and more astonished. We are identical! Oh,\r\nMarie Bashkirtseff! how we should have hated one another! She feels as I\r\nfeel. We have the same self-absorption, the same vanity and corroding\r\nambition. She is impressionable, volatile, passionate--ill! So am I. Her\r\njournal is my journal. All mine is stale reading now. She has written\r\ndown all my thoughts and forestalled me! Already I have found some\r\nheart-rending parallels. To think I am only a replica: how humiliating\r\nfor a human being to find himself merely a duplicate of another. Is\r\nthere anything in the transmigration of souls? She died in 1886. I was\r\nborn in 1889.\r\n\r\n_October_ 15.\r\n\r\nA man is always looking at himself in the mirror if for no other reason\r\nthan to tie his tie and brush his hair. What does he think of his face?\r\nHe must have private opinions. But it is usually considered a little out\r\nof taste to entertain opinions about one's personal appearance.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, some mirrors do me down pretty well, others depress me!\r\nI am bound to confess I am biassed in favour of the friendly mirror. I\r\nam not handsome, but I look interesting--I hope distinguished. My eyes\r\nare deep-set ... but my worst moments are when the barber combs my hair\r\nright down over my forehead, or when I see a really handsome man in Hyde\r\nPark. Such occasions direct my gaze reflexly, and doubt like a thief in\r\nthe night forces the back door!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo-day, M---- sent me dancing mad by suggesting that I copied R---- in\r\nmy manner of speech and opinions.\r\n\r\nNow R---- has a damned pervasive way of conducting himself--for all the\r\nworld as if he were a high official of the Foreign Office. I, on the\r\ncontrary, am shy, self-conscious, easily overlooked, and this makes me\r\nwrithe. As we are inseparable friends--everybody assumes that I am his\r\ntacky-lacky, a kind of appoggiatura to his big note. He, they suppose,\r\nis my guide, philosopher, and Great Maecenas--Oxford befriending the\r\nproletariat. The thought of it makes me sick--that any one should\r\nbelieve I imbibe his ideas, echo his conceits, and even ape his gestures\r\nand manner of voice.\r\n\r\n\"Lost yourself?\" inquired a despicable creature the other morning as I\r\ncame out of R----'s room after finding him out. I could have shot him\r\ndead! ... As for ---- more than one person thinks that he alone is the\r\nbrilliant author until at last he himself has got into the way of\r\nthinking it.\r\n\r\n\"It makes me hate you like mad,\" I said to him to-day. \"How can I\r\nconfront these people with the naked truth?\" R---- chuckled\r\ncomplacently.\r\n\r\n\"If I deny your alleged supremacy, as I did this morning, or if\r\nsuddenly, in a fit of spleen, I'm induced to declare that I loathe you\r\n(as I sometimes do)\"--(more chuckles) \"that your breath stinks, your\r\neyes bulge, that you have swollen jugulars and a platter face: they will\r\nthink I am either jealous or insincere.... To be your Echo tho'!--my\r\nGod!\" I spat. We then grinned at one another, and I, being bored, went\r\nto the lavatory and read the newspaper secure from interruption.\r\n\r\n_Resignation_\r\n\r\nIn the Tube, a young widow came in and sat in front of me--pale-faced,\r\ngrief-stricken, demure--a sort of \"Thy Will be Done\" look. The\r\nadaptability of human beings has something in it that seems horrible. It\r\nis dreadful to think how we have all accommodated ourselves to this War.\r\nChristian resignation is a feeble thing. Why won't this demure widow\r\nwith a loud voice blaspheme against this iniquitous world that permits\r\nthis iniquitous war?\r\n\r\n_October_ 21.\r\n\r\nI myself (licking a stamp): \"The taste of gum is really very nice.\"\r\n\r\nR.: \"I hate it.\"\r\n\r\nI: \"My dear fellow\" (surprised and entreating), \"envelope gum is simply\r\ndelicious.\"\r\n\r\nR.: \"I never lick stamps--it's dangerous--microbes.\"\r\n\r\nI: \"I always do: I shall buy a bookful and go away to the seaside with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nR.: \"Yes, you'll need to.\"\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nThus gaily and jauntily we went on to discuss wines, whiskies, and\r\nWorthington's, and I rounded it up in a typical cock-eyed manner,--\r\n\r\n\"Ah! yes, it's only when the day is over that the day really\r\nbegins--what?\"\r\n\r\n_October_ 23.\r\n\r\nI expressed to R---- to-day my admiration for the exploit of the brave\r\nand successful Submarine Commander Max Kennedy Horton. (Name for you!)\r\nR---- was rather cold. \"His exploits,\" said this bloody fool, \"involve\r\nloss of life and scarcely make me deliriously eulogistic.\"\r\n\r\nI cleared my throat and began,--\r\n\r\n\"Your precious sociology again--it will be the ruin of your career as an\r\nartist. It is so interwoven into the fibre of your brain that you never\r\nsee anything except in relation to its State value. You are afraid to\r\napprove of a lying, thieving rogue, however delightful a rascal he may\r\nbe, for fear of what Karl Marx might say.... You'll soon be drawing\r\nlandscapes with taxpayers in the foreground, or we shall get a picture\r\nof Ben Nevis with Keir Hardie on the summit.\" And so on to our own\r\ninfinite mutual amusement.\r\n\r\nThe _English Review_ returns my Essay. I am getting simply furious with\r\nan ambition I am unable to satisfy, among beautiful London women I\r\ncannot get to know, and in ill-health that I cannot cure. Shall I ever\r\nfind any one? Shall I ever be really well? My one solace is that I do\r\nnot submit, it infuriates me, I resent it; I will never be resigned and\r\nmilky. I will keep my claws sharp and fight to the end.\r\n\r\n_October_ 24.\r\n\r\nWent to Mark Lane by train, then walked over the Tower Bridge, and back\r\nalong Lower Thames Street to London Bridge, up to Whitechapel, St.\r\nPaul's, Fleet Street, and Charing Cross, and so home.\r\n\r\nNear Reilly's Tavern, I saw a pavement artist who had drawn a loaf with\r\nthe inscription in both French and English: \"This is easy to draw but\r\nhard to earn.\" A baby's funeral trotted briskly over the Tower Bridge\r\namong Pink's jam waggons, carts carrying any goods from lead pencils and\r\nmatches to bales of cotton and chests of tea.\r\n\r\nIn the St. Catherine's Way there is one part like a deep railway\r\ncutting, the whole of one side for a long way, consisting of the\r\nbrickwall of a very tall warehouse with no windows in it and beautifully\r\ncurved and producing a wonderful effect. Walked past great blocks of\r\nwarehouses and business establishments--a wonderful sight; and\r\neverywhere bacon factors, coffee roasters, merchants. On London Bridge,\r\npaused to feed the sea-gulls and looked down at the stevedores. Outside\r\nBillingsgate Market was a blackboard on an easel--for market prices--but\r\ninstead some one had drawn an enormously enlarged chalk picture of a\r\ncat's rear and tail with anatomical details.\r\n\r\nIn Aldgate, stopped to inspect a street stall containing popular\r\nliterature--one brochure entitled _Suspended for Life_ to indicate the\r\nterrible punishment meted out to ----, a League footballer. The\r\nfrontispiece enough to make a lump come in the juveniles' throats!\r\nAnother stall held domestic utensils with an intimation, \"Anything on\r\nthis stall _lent_ for 1d.\" A newsvendor I heard exclaim to a\r\nfellow-tradesman in the same line of business,--\r\n\r\n\"They come and look at your bloody plakaard and then passe on.\"\r\n\r\nLoitered at a dirty little Fleet Street bookshop where Paul de Koch's\r\n_The Lady with the Three Pairs of Stays_ was displayed prominently\r\nbeside a picture of Oscar Wilde.\r\n\r\nIn Fleet Street, you exchange the Whitechapel sausage restaurants for\r\nTaverns with \"snacks at the bar,\" and the chestnut roasters, with their\r\nbuckets of red-hot coals, for Grub Street camp followers, selling\r\n_L'Indépendance Belge_ or pamphlets entitled, _Why We Went to War_.\r\n\r\nIn the Strand you may buy war maps, buttonhole flags, etc., etc. I\r\nbought a penny stud. One shop was turned into a shooting gallery at\r\nthree shots a penny where the Inner Temple Barristers in between the\r\ncase for the defence and the case for the prosecution could come and\r\nkeep their eye in against the time the Germans come.\r\n\r\nOutside Charing Cross Station I saw a good-looking, well-dressed woman\r\nin mourning clothes, grinding a barrel organ....\r\n\r\nReturned to the Library and read the _Dublin Review_ (article on Samuel\r\nButler), _North American Review_ (one on Henry James) and dined at seven.\r\nAfter dinner, read: _Evening Standard, Saturday Westminster_, and the\r\n_New Statesman_. Smoked six cigarettes and went to bed. To-morrow Fifth\r\nSymphony of Beethoven.\r\n\r\n_October_ 25.\r\n\r\n_Too Late_\r\n\r\nYesterday's ramble has left me very sore in spirit. London was spread\r\nout before me, a vast campagne. But I felt too physically tired to\r\nexplore. I could just amble along--a spectator merely--and automatically\r\nregister impressions. Think of the misery of that! I want to see the\r\nDocks and Dockland, to enter East End public-houses and opium-dens, to\r\nspeak to Chinamen and Lascars: I want a first-rate, first-hand knowledge\r\nof London, of London men, London women. I was tingling with anticipation\r\nyesterday and then I grew tired and fretful and morose, crawled back\r\nlike a weevil into my nut. By 6.30 I was in a Library reading the\r\n_Dublin Review_!\r\n\r\nWhat a young fool I was to neglect those priceless opportunities of\r\nstudying and tasting life and character in North ----, at Borough\r\nCouncil meetings, Boards of Guardians, and electioneering campaigns--not\r\nto mention inquests, police courts, and country fairs. Instead of\r\nappraising all these precious and genuine pieces of experience at their\r\ntrue value, my diary and my mind were occupied only with--Zoology, if\r\nyou please. I ignored my exquisite chances, I ramped around, fuming and\r\nfretting, full of contempt for my circumscribed existence, and impatient\r\nas only a youth can be. What I shall never forgive myself is my present\r\ninability to recall that life, so that instead of being able now to push\r\nmy chair back and entertain myself and others with descriptions of some\r\nof those antique and incredible happenings, my memory is rigid and\r\nformal: I remember only a few names and one or two isolated events. All\r\nthat time is just as if it had never been. My recollections form only an\r\nindefinite smudge--odd Town Clerks, Town Criers (at least five of them\r\nin wonderful garb), policemen (I poached with one), ploughing match\r\ndinners (platters of roast beef and boiled potatoes and I, bespectacled\r\nstudent of Zoology, sitting uncomfortably among valiant trenchermen\r\nafter their day's ploughing), election meetings in remote Exmoor\r\nvillages (and those wonderful Inns where I had to spend the night!)--all\r\nare gone--too remote to bear recital--yet just sufficiently clear to\r\nharass the mind in my constant endeavours to raise them all again from\r\nthe dead in my consciousness. I hate to think it is lost; that my youth\r\nis buried--a cemetery without even headstones. To an inquest on a\r\ndrowned sailor--disclosing some thrilling story of the wild seas off the\r\ncoast--with a pitiful myopia--I preferred Wiedersheim's _Comparative\r\nAnatomy of Vertebrates_. I used to carry Dr. Smith Woodward's\r\n_Paleontology_ with me to a Board of Guardians meeting, mingling\r\n_Pariasaurus_ and Holoptychians with tenders for repairs and reports\r\nfrom the Master. Now I take Keats or Tschekov to the Museum!\r\n\r\nLondon certainly lies before me. Certainly I am alive at last. Yet now\r\nmy energy is gone. It is too late. I am ill and tired. It costs me\r\ninfinite discomfort to write this entry, all the skin of my right hand\r\nis permanently \"pins and needles\" and in the finger tips I have lost all\r\nsense of touch. The sight of my right eye is also very bad and sometimes\r\nI can scarcely read print with it, etc., etc. But why should I go on?\r\n\r\nA trance-like condition supervenes in a semi-invalid forced to live in\r\nalmost complete social isolation in a great whirling city like London.\r\nDays of routine follow each other as swiftly as the weaver's shuttle and\r\nnumb the spirit and turn palpitating life into a silent picture show.\r\nEverywhere always in the street people--millions of them --whom I do not\r\nknow, moving swiftly along. I look and look and yawn and then one day as\r\nto-day I wake up and race about beside myself--a swollen bag ready to\r\nburst with hope, love, misery, joy, desperation.\r\n\r\n_Apologia pro vita mea_\r\n\r\nHow may I excuse myself for continuing to talk about my affairs and for\r\ncontinuing to write zoological memoirs during the greatest War of all\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nWell, here are some precedents:--\r\n\r\nGoethe sat down to study the geography of China, while his fatherland\r\nagonised at Leipsig.\r\n\r\nHegel wrote the last lines of the _Phenomenology of Spirit_ within sound\r\nof the guns of Jena.\r\n\r\nWhile England was being rent in twain by civil war, Sir Thomas Browne,\r\nensconced in old Norwich, reflected on Cambyses and Pharaoh and on the\r\nsong the Sirens sang.\r\n\r\nLacépède composed his _Histoire des Poissons_ during the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThen there were Diogenes and Archimedes.\r\n\r\nThis defence of course implicates me in an unbounded opinion of the\r\nimportance of my own work. \"He is quite the little poet,\" some one said\r\nof Keats. \"It is just as if a man remarked of Buonaparte,\" said Keats,\r\nin a pet, \"that he's quite the little general.\"\r\n\r\n_A Woman and a Child_\r\n\r\nOn the way to the Albert Hall came upon the most beautiful picture of\r\nyoung maternity that ever I saw in my life. She was a delightfully\r\ngirlish young creature--a perfect phœnix of health and beauty. As she\r\nstood with her little son at the kerb waiting for a 'bus, smiling and\r\nchatting to him, a luminous radiance of happy, satisfied maternal love,\r\nmaternal pride, womanliness streamed from her and enveloped me.\r\n\r\nWe got on the same 'bus. The little boy, with his long hair and dressed\r\nin velvet like little Lord Fauntleroy, said something to her--she smiled\r\ndelightedly, caught him up on her knees and kissed him. Two such pretty\r\npeople never touched lips before--I'm certain of it. It was impossible\r\nto believe that this virginal creature was a mother--childbirth left no\r\ntrace. She must have just budded off the baby boy like a plant. Once, in\r\nher glance, she took me in her purview, and I knew she knew I was\r\nwatching her. In travelling backwards from Kensington Gardens to the boy\r\nagain, her gaze rested on me a moment and I, of course, rendered the\r\nhomage that was due. As a matter of fact there was no direct evidence\r\nthat she was the mother at all.\r\n\r\n_The Albert Hall Hag_\r\n\r\nWhile waiting outside the Albert Hall, an extraordinarily weird contrast\r\nthrust itself before me--she was the most pathetic piece of human jetsam\r\nthat ever I saw drifting about in this sea of London faces. Tall, gaunt,\r\ncadaverous, the skin of her face drawn tightly over her cheekbones and\r\nover a thin, pointed, hook-shaped nose, on her feet brown sandshoes,\r\ndressed in a long draggle-tailed skirt, a broken-brimmed straw hat,\r\nbeneath which some scanty hair was scraped back and tied behind in a\r\nknot--this wretched soul of some thirty summers (and what summers!)\r\nstood in the road beside the waiting queue and weakly passed the bow\r\nacross her violin which emitted a slight scraping sound. She could not\r\nplay a tune and the fingers of her left hand never touched the\r\nstrings--they merely held the handle.\r\n\r\nA policeman passed and, with an eye on the queue, muttered audibly, \"Not\r\n'arf,\" but no one laughed. Then she began to rummage in her skirt,\r\nholding the violin by the neck in her right hand just as she must hold\r\nher brat by the arm when at home. Simultaneously sounds issued from her\r\nmouth in a high falsetto key; they were unearthly sounds, the tiny voice\r\nof an articulating corpse underneath the coffin lid. For a moment no one\r\nrealised that she was reciting. For she continued to rummage in her\r\nskirt as she squeaked, \"Break, break, break, on thy cold gray stones, O\r\nsea,\" etc. The words were scarcely audible tho' she stood but two yards\r\noff. But she repeated the verse and I then made out what it was. She\r\nseemed ashamed of herself and of her plight, almost without the courage\r\nto foist this mockery of violin-playing on us--one would say she was\r\nfrightened by her own ugliness and her own pathos.\r\n\r\nAfter conscientiously carrying out her programme but with the\r\ndistracted, uncomfortable air of some one scurrying over a painful\r\ntask--like a tired child gabbling its prayers before getting into\r\nbed--she at length produced from her skirt pocket a small canvas money\r\nbag which she started to hand around. This was the climax to this\r\nharrowing incident--for each time she held out the bag, she smiled,\r\nwhich stretched the skin still more tightly down over her malar\r\nprominence and said something--an inarticulate noise in a very high\r\npitch. \"A woman,\" I whispered to R----, \"She claims to be a woman.\" If\r\nany one hesitated a moment or struggled with a purse she would wait\r\npatiently with bag outstretched and head turned away, the smile\r\nvanishing at once as if the pinched face were but too glad of the\r\nopportunity of a rest from smiling. She stood there, gazing\r\nabsently--two lifeless eyes at the bottom of deep socket holes in a head\r\nwhich was almost a bare skull. She was perfunctorily carrying out an\r\nobjectionable task because she could not kill the will to live.\r\n\r\nAs she looked away and waited for you to produce the copper, she\r\nthought, \"Why trouble? Why should I wait for this man's aid?\" The clink\r\nof the penny recalled her to herself, and she passed on, renewing her\r\nterrible grimacing smile.\r\n\r\nWhy didn't I do something? Why? Because I was bent on hearing\r\nBeethoven's Fifth Symphony, if you please.... And she may have been a\r\nwell-to-do vagrant--well got up for the occasion--a clever\r\nsimulator?...\r\n\r\n_October_ 28.\r\n\r\n_Rigor Bordis_\r\n\r\nRigor bordis!--I write like this as if it were a light matter. But\r\nto-night I was _in extremis_.... First I read the paper; then I finished\r\nthe book I was reading--\"_Thus Spake Zarathustra_.\" Not knowing quite\r\nwhat next to do, I took my boots off and poured out another cup of\r\ncoffee. But these manœuvres were only the feeble attempts of a\r\ncowardly wretch to evade the main issue which was:--\r\n\r\nHow to occupy myself and keep myself sane during the hour and a half\r\nbefore bedtime.\r\n\r\nBefore now I have tried going off to bed. But that does not work--I\r\ndon't sleep. Moreover, I have been in the grip of a horrible mental\r\nunrest. To sit still in my chair, much less to lie in bed doing nothing\r\nseemed ghastly. I experienced all the cravings of a dissolute neurotic\r\nfor a stimulus, but what stimulus I wanted I did not know. Had I known I\r\nshould have gone and got it. The dipsomaniac was a man to be envied.\r\n\r\nSome mechanical means were necessary for sustaining life till bedtime. I\r\nsat down and played a game of Patience--no one knows how I loathe\r\nplaying Patience and how much I despise the people who play it. Tiring\r\nof that, sat back in my chair, yawned, and thought of a word I wanted to\r\nlook up in the Dictionary. This quest, forgotten until then, came like a\r\nbeam of bright light into a dark room. So looked the word up leisurely,\r\ntook out my watch, noted the time, and then stood up with elbows on the\r\nmantelpiece and stared at myself in the glass.... I was at bay at last.\r\nThere was simply nothing I could do. I would have given worlds to have\r\nsome one to talk to. Pride kept me from ringing for the landlady. I must\r\nstand motionless, back to the wall, and wait for the hour of my release.\r\nI had but one idea, viz., that I was surely beaten in this game of life.\r\nI was very miserable indeed. But being so miserable that I couldn't feel\r\nmore so, I began to recover after a while. I began to visualise my\r\nlamentable situation, and rose above it as I did so. I staged it before\r\nmy mind's eye and observed myself as hero of the plot. I saw myself\r\nsitting in a dirty armchair in a dirty house in a dirty London street,\r\nwith the landlady's dirty daughter below-stairs singing, \"Little Grey\r\nHome in the West,\" my head obscured in a cloud of depression, and in my\r\nmind the thought that if life be a test of endurance I must hang on\r\ngrimly to the arms of the chair and sit tight till bedtime.\r\n\r\nThis attitude proved a useful means of self-defence. When I had\r\ndramatised my misery, I enjoyed it, and acute mental pain turned into\r\nmerely aesthetic malaise.\r\n\r\n_November_ 4.\r\n\r\nA lurid day. Suffering from the most horrible physical languor. Wrote\r\nthe Doctor saying I was rapidly sliding down a steep place into the sea\r\n(like the swine I am). Could I see him?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEndured an hour's torture of indecision to-night asking myself whether I\r\nshould go over to ask her to be my wife or should I go to the Fabian\r\nSociety and hear Bernard Shaw. Kept putting off the decision even till\r\nafter dinner. If I went to the flat, I must shave; to shave required hot\r\nwater--the landlady had already cleared the table and was rapidly\r\nretreating. Something must be done and at once. I called the old thing\r\nback impulsively and ordered shaving water, consoling myself with the\r\nreflection that it was still unnecessary to decide; the hot water could\r\nbe at hand in case the worst happened. If I decided on matrimony I could\r\nshave forthwith. Should I? (After dark I always shave in the\r\nsitting-room because of the better gaslight.)\r\n\r\nDrank some coffee and next found myself slowly, mournfully putting on\r\nhat and coat. You can't shave in hat and coat so I concluded I had\r\ndecided on Shaw. Slowly undid the front door latch and went off.\r\n\r\nShaw bored me. He is mid-Victorian. Sat beside a bulgy-eyed youth\r\nreading the _Freethinker_.\r\n\r\n_November_ 9.\r\n\r\nIn the evening asked her to be my wife. She refused. Once perhaps ...\r\nbut now....\r\n\r\nI don't think I have any moral right to propose to any woman seeing the\r\nstate of my health and I did not actually intend or wish to.... It was\r\njust to get it off my mind--a plain statement.... If I don't really and\r\ntruly love her it was a perfectly heartless comedy. But I have good\r\nreason to believe I do. With me, moments of headstrong passion alternate\r\nwith moods of perfectly immobile self-introspection. It is a relief to\r\nhave spoken.\r\n\r\n_November_ 10.\r\n\r\nVery miserable. Asked R---- three times to come and have dinner with me.\r\nEach time he refused. My nerves are completely jangled. _Tu l'as voulu,\r\nGeorge Dandin_--that's the rub.\r\n\r\n_November_ 11.\r\n\r\nShe observed me carefully--I'm looking a perfect wreck _--tu l'as voulu,\r\nGeorge Dandin_--but it's mainly ill-health and not on her account.\r\n\r\nI said,--\r\n\r\n\"Some things are too funny to laugh at.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that why you are so solemn?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I answered, \"I'm not solemn, I am laughing--some things are too\r\nsolemn to be serious about.\"\r\n\r\nShe saw me off at the door and smiled quietly--an amused faraway smile\r\nof feline satisfaction....\r\n\r\n_November_ 12.\r\n\r\nHorrible nervous depression. Thinking of suicide with a pistol--a\r\nBrowning. Or of 10 days' mysterious disappearance, when I will go and\r\nlive in a good Hotel, spend all my money, and live among human beings\r\nwith eyes and noses and legs. This isolation. Am I going mad? If I\r\ndisappeared, it would be interesting to see if any one missed me.\r\n\r\n_November_ 13.\r\n\r\nStill thinking of suicide. It seems the only way out. This morning my\r\nEssay was returned by the Editor of ----. One by one I have been\r\ndivested of all my most cherished illusions. Once my ambitions gave me\r\nthe fuel with which to keep myself alive. One after another they have\r\nbeen foiled, and now I've nothing to burn. I am daily facing the fact\r\nthat my ambitions have overtaxed my abilities and health. For years, my\r\nwhole existence has rested on a false estimate of my own value, and my\r\nlife been revolving around a foolish self-deception. But I know myself\r\nas I am at last--and am not at all enamoured. The future has nothing for\r\nme. I am wearied of my life already. What is there for any of us to do\r\nbut die?\r\n\r\n_November_ 14.\r\n\r\nBefore going over to-night bought _London Opinion_ deliberately in order\r\nto find a joke or better still some cynicism about women to fire off at\r\nher. Rehearsed one joke, one witticism from Oscar Wilde, and one\r\npersonal anecdote (the latter for the most part false), none of which\r\ncame off, tho' I succeeded in carrying off a nonchalant or even jaunty\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you ever swear?\" I asked. \"It's a good thing you know, swearing\r\nis like pimples, better to come out, cleanses the moral system. The\r\nperson who controls himself must have lots of terrible oaths circulating\r\nin his blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swearing is not the only remedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you prefer the gilded pill of a curate's sermon: I prefer\r\npimples to pills.\"\r\n\r\nIs it a wonder she does not love me?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wonder why I paint myself in such horrid colours--why have I this\r\nmorbid pleasure in pretending to those I love that I am a beast and a\r\ncynic? I suffer, I suppose, from a lacerated self-esteem, from a painful\r\nloneliness, from the consciousness of how ridiculous I have made myself,\r\nand that most people if they knew would regard me with loathing and\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nI am very unhappy. I am unhappy because she does not care for me, and I\r\nam chiefly unhappy because I do not care for her. Instead of a passion,\r\nonly a dragging heavy chain of attraction ... some inflexible law makes\r\nme gravitate to her, seizes me by the neck and suspends me over her, I\r\ncannot look away....\r\n\r\nIn the early days when I did my best to strangle my love--as one would a\r\nbastard child--I took courage in the fact that for a man like me the\r\nmurder was necessary. There were books to write and to read, and name\r\nand fame perhaps. To these everything must be sacrificed. ... That is\r\nall gone now. No man could have withstood for ever that concentrated\r\nessence of womanhood that flowed from her....\r\n\r\nStill the declaration has made amends. She is pleased about it--it is a\r\nscalp.\r\n\r\nYet how can I forgive her for saying she supposed it was a natural\r\ninstinct for a girl not to feel drawn to an invalid like me. That was\r\ncruel tho' true.\r\n\r\n_November_ 19.\r\n\r\nI might be Captain Scott writing his last words amid Antarctic cold and\r\ndesolation. It is very cold. I am sitting hunched up by the fire in my\r\nlodgings after a meal of tough meat and cold apple-tart. I am full of\r\nself-commiseration--my only pleasure now. It is very cold and I cannot\r\nget warm--try as I will.\r\n\r\nMy various nervous derangements take different forms. This time my\r\nperipheral circulation is affected, and the hand, arm, and shoulder are\r\npermanently cold. My right hand is blue--tho' I've shut up the window\r\nand piled up a roaring fire. It's Antarctic cold and desolation. London\r\nin November from the inside of a dingy lodging-house can be very\r\nterrible indeed. This celestial isolation will send me out of my mind. I\r\nmarvel how God can stick it--lonely, damp, and cold in the clouds. That\r\nis how I live too--but then I am not God.\r\n\r\nI fall back on this Journal just as some other poor devil takes to\r\ndrink. I, too, have toyed with the idea of drinking hard. I have\r\nfrequented bars and billiards saloons and in fits of depression done my\r\nbest to forget myself. But I am not sufficiently fond of alcohol (and it\r\nwould take a lot to make _me_ forget myself). So I plunge into these\r\nliterary excesses and drown my sorrows in Stephens' Blue-black Ink. It\r\ngives me a sulky pleasure to think that some day somebody will know....\r\n\r\nIt is humiliating to feel ill as I do. If I had consumption, the disease\r\nwould act as a stimulus--I could strike an attitude feverishly and be\r\nhistrionic. But to be merely \"below par\"--to feel like a Bunny rabbit\r\nperennially \"poorly,\" saps my character and mental vigour. I want to\r\ncrawl away and die like a rat in a hole. A bronzed healthy man makes me\r\nwince. Healthy people regard a chronic sickly man as a leper. They\r\nsuspect him, something fishy.\r\n\r\n_November_ 20.\r\n\r\nStill at home ill.\r\n\r\nIf anything, R---- is more of a précieux than I am myself. At the\r\npresent moment he is tickling himself with the idea that he's in love\r\nwith a certain golden-haired damsel from the States. He reports to me\r\nfragments of his conversations with her, how he snatches a fearful joy\r\nby skirting dangerous conversational territory, or he takes a pencil and\r\ndeftly outlines her profile or the rondeur of her bosom. Or he\r\ndiscourses at length on her nose or eye. I can well imagine him driving\r\na woman crazy and then collecting her tears in a bottle as mementoes.\r\nThen whenever he requires a little heart stimulus he could take the\r\nphial from his waistcoat pocket and watch the tears condensing.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you marry her out of hand and be done with all this\r\ndalliance? I can tell you what's the matter with you,\" I growled,\r\n\"you're a landscape artist.... You'll grow to resemble, that mean, Jewy,\r\nsecretive, petty creature, J.W.M. Turner, and allow no human being to\r\ninterfere with your art. A fine artist perhaps--but what a man! You'll\r\nfinish up with a Mrs. Danby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered, quoting Tennyson with great aptness, \"and 'lose my\r\nsalvation for a sketch,' like Romney deserting his wife. If I were not\r\nmarried I should have no wife to desert.\"\r\n\r\nIt is useless to argue with him. His cosmogony is wrongly centred in Art\r\nnot life. Life interests him--he can't altogether resign himself to the\r\ncowl and the tonsured head, but he will not plunge. He insists on being\r\na spectator, watching the maelstrom from the bank and remarking\r\nexquisitely, \"Ah! there is a very fine sorrow,\" or, \"What an exquisite\r\nsensation.\" The other day after one of our furious conversational bouts\r\naround this subject, I drew an insect, cut it out, and pinned the slip\r\nin a collecting box. Then suddenly producing the box, and opening it\r\nwith a facetious grin, I said,--\r\n\r\n\"Here is a jolly little sorrow I caught this morning.\" The joke pleased\r\nhim and we roared, bellowed.\r\n\r\n\"That terrible forefinger of yours,\" he smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Like Cardinal Richelieu's eyes--piercing?\" I suggested with\r\nappreciation. (It is because I tap him on his shirt front in the space\r\nbetween waistcoat and tie aggressively for emphasis in conversation.)\r\n\r\n\"You must regard my passion for painting,\" he began once more, \"as a\r\nsort of dipsomania--I really can't help myself.\"\r\n\r\nI jumped on him vehemently,--\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, my pernickety friend; it's something abnormal and unnatural.\r\nWhen, for purposes of self-culture, I see a man deliberately lop off\r\ngreat branches of himself so as to divert his strength into one limb, I\r\nknow that if he is successful he'll be something as vulgar as a fat\r\nwoman at a country fair; and if he is unsuccessful he'll be just a\r\npathetic mutilation.... You are trying to pervert a natural instinct.\r\nYou want to paint, I believe. Quite so. But when a boy reaches the age\r\nof puberty he does not grow a palette on his chin but hair.... Still,\r\nnow you recognise it as a bad habit, why need I say more?\" (\"Why\r\nindeed?\") \"It's a vice, and I'm very sorry for you, old boy. I'll do all\r\nI can--come and have some dinner with me to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! thank you very much,\" says my gentleman, \"but I'm not at all sorry\r\nfor myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought as much. So that we are not so very much agreed after all.\r\nWe're not shaking hands after the boxing contest, but scowling at each\r\nother from the ropes and shaping for another round.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your pulpit orations, my dear Barbellion, in full canonicals,\" he\r\nreflected, \"are worthy of a larger audience.... To find _you_ of all\r\npeople preaching. I thought you were philosopher enough to see the angle\r\nof every one's vision and broadminded so as to see every point of view.\r\nBesides, you are as afraid of marriage as I am, and for the same\r\nreasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess, when in the philosophic citadel of my own armchair,\" I\r\nbegan, \"I _do_ see every one's point of view. You sit on the other side\r\nof the rug and put out the suggestion tentatively that murder may be a\r\nmoral act. I examine your argument and am disposed to accept it. But\r\nwhen you slit up my brother's abdomen before my eyes, I am sufficiently\r\nweak and human to punch you on the nose.... You are too cold and\r\nOlympian, up above the snowline with a box of paints.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very beautiful among the snows.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n(Exit.)\r\n\r\n_November_ 23.\r\n\r\nGreat physical languor, especially in the morning. It is Calvary to get\r\nout of bed and shoulder the day's burden.\r\n\r\n\"What's been the matter?\" they ask.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! senile decay--general histolysis of the tissues,\" I say, fencing.\r\n\r\nTo-night, I looked at myself accidentally in the glass and noticed at\r\nonce the alarming extent of my dejection. Quite unconsciously I turned\r\nmy head away and shook it, making the noise with my teeth and tongue\r\nwhich means, \"Dear, dear.\" M---- tells me these waves of ill-health are\r\nquite unaccountable unless I were \"leading a dissolute life, which you\r\ndo not appear to be doing.\" Damn his eyes.\r\n\r\n_Reading Nietzsche_\r\n\r\nReading Nietzsche. What splendid physic he is to Pomeranian puppies like\r\nmyself! I am a hopeless coward. Thunderstorms always frighten me. The\r\nsmallest cut alarms for fear of blood poisoning, and I always dab on\r\nantiseptics at once. But Nietzsche makes me feel a perfect mastiff.\r\n\r\n_The Test for True Love_\r\n\r\nThe test for true love is whether you can endure the thought of cutting\r\nyour sweetheart's toe-nails--the onychiotomic test. Or whether you find\r\nyour Julia's sweat as sweet as otto of roses. I told her this to-night.\r\nProbably she thinks I only \"saw it in a book.\"\r\n\r\n_Chopin_\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, went to the Albert Hall, and warmed myself at the Orchestra.\r\nIt is a wonderful sight to watch an orchestra playing from the gallery.\r\nIt spurts and flickers like a flame. Its incessant activity arrests the\r\nattention and holds it just as a fire does--even a deaf man would be\r\nfascinated. Heard Chopin's Funeral March and other things. It would be a\r\nrich experience to be able to be in your coffin at rest and listen to\r\nChopin's Funeral March being played above you by a string orchestra with\r\nSir Henry Wood conducting.\r\n\r\nSir Henry like a melanic Messiah was crucified as usual, the Hungarian\r\nRhapsody No. 2 causing him the most awful agony....\r\n\r\n_November_ 28.\r\n\r\n_Rodin_\r\n\r\nMore than once lately have been to see and admire Rodin's recent gifts\r\nto the nation exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The \"Prodigal\r\nSon\" is Beethoven's Fifth Symphony done in stone. It was only on my\r\nsecond visit that I noticed the small pebble in each hand--a superb\r\ntouch!--what a frenzy of remorse!\r\n\r\nThe \"Fallen Angel\" I loved most. The legs of the woman droop lifelessly\r\nbackwards in an intoxicating curve. The eye caresses it--down the thighs\r\nand over the calves to the tips of the toes--like the hind limbs of some\r\nbeautiful dead gazelle. He has brought off exactly the same effect in\r\nthe woman in the group called \"Eternal Spring,\" which I have only seen\r\nin a photograph.\r\n\r\nThis morning at 9 a.m. lay in bed on my back, warm and comfortable, and,\r\nfor the first time for many weeks, with no pain or discomfort of any\r\nkind. The mattress curved up around my body and legs and held me in a\r\nsoft warm embrace.... I shut my eyes and whistled the saccharine melody\r\nfor solo violin in Chopin's Funeral March. I wanted the moment prolonged\r\nfor hours. Ill-health chases the soul out of a man. He becomes a body,\r\npurely physical.\r\n\r\n_November_ 29.\r\n\r\nThis evening she promised to be my wife after a long silent ramble\r\ntogether thro' dark London squares and streets! I am beside myself!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_December_ 6.\r\n\r\nI know now--I love her with passion. Health and ambition and sanity are\r\nreturning. Projects in view:--\r\n\r\n(1) To make her happy and myself worthy.\r\n\r\n(2) To get married.\r\n\r\n(3) To prepare and publish a volume of this Journal.\r\n\r\n(4) To write two essays for _Cornhill_ which shall surely induce the\r\nEditor to publish and not write me merely long complimentary and\r\nencouraging letters as heretofore.\r\n\r\nWired to A----, \"The brave little pennon has been hauled down.\"\r\n\r\n_December_ 7.\r\n\r\nHave so many projects in view and so little time in which to get them\r\ndone! Moreover I am always haunted by the fear that I may never finish\r\nthem thro' physical or temperamental disabilities--a breakdown in health\r\nor in purpose. I am one of those who are apt to die unexpectedly and no\r\none would be surprised. An inquest would probably be unnecessary. I\r\nbadly want to live say another twelve months. Hey! nonny-no! a man's a\r\nfool that wants to die.\r\n\r\n_December_ 9.\r\n\r\n... I shook her angrily by the shoulders to-night and said, \"Why do I\r\nlove you?--Tell me,\" but she only smiled gently and said, \"I cannot\r\ntell....\" I ought not to love her, I know--every omen is against it....\r\nThen I am full of self-love: an intellectual Malvolio proud of his\r\nbrains and air of distinction....\r\n\r\nThen I am fickle, passionate, polygamous ... I am haunted by the memory\r\nof how I have sloughed off one enthusiasm after another. I used to\r\ndissect snails in a pie-dish in the kitchen while Mother baked the\r\ncakes--the unravelling of the internal economy of a _Helix_ caused as\r\ngreat an emotional storm as to-day the Unfinished Symphony does! I look\r\nfor the first parasol in Kensington Gardens with the same interest as\r\nonce I sought out the first snowdrop or listened for the first Cuckoo. I\r\nam as anxious to identify an instrument in Sir Henry's Orchestra as once\r\nto identify the song of a new bird in the woods. Nothing is further from\r\nmy intention or desire to continue my old habit of nature study. I never\r\nread nature books--my old favourites--Waterton's _Wanderings_, Gilbert\r\nWhite, _The Zoologist_, etc.--have no interest for me--in fact they give\r\nme slight mental nausea even to glance at. Wiedersheim (good old\r\nWiedersheim) is now deposed by a text book on Harmony. My main desire\r\njust now is to hear the best music. In the country I wore blinkers and\r\nsaw only zoology. Now in London, I've taken the bit in my mouth--and\r\nit's a mouth of iron--wanting a run for all my troubles before Death\r\nstrikes me down.\r\n\r\nAll this evidence of my temperamental instability alarms and distresses\r\nme on reflection and makes the soul weary. I wish I loved more steadily.\r\nI am always sidetracking myself. The title of \"husband\" scares me.\r\n\r\n_December_ 12.\r\n\r\n_Sir Henry Wood conducting_\r\n\r\nWent to the Queen's Hall, sat in the Orchestra and watched Sir Henry's\r\nstatuesque figure conducting thro' a forest of bows, \"which pleased me\r\nmightily.\" He would be worth watching if you were stone deaf. If you\r\ncould not hear a sound, the animation and excitement of an orchestra in\r\nfull swing, with the conductor cutting and slashing at invisible foes,\r\nmake a magnificent spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe face of Sir Henry Wood strikes me as very much like the traditional\r\npictures of Jesus Christ, tho' Sir Henry is dark--the melanic Messiah I\r\ncall him (very much to my own delight). Rodin ought to do him in\r\nstone--Chesterfield's ideal of a man--a Corinthian edifice on Tuscan\r\nfoundations. In Sir Henry's case there can be no disputing the Tuscan\r\nfoundations. However swift and elegant the movements of his arms, his\r\nsplendid lower extremities remain as firm as stone columns. While the\r\nmusic is calm and serene his right hand and baton execute in concert\r\nwith the left, perfect geometric curves around his head. Then as it\r\ngathers in force and volume, when the bows begin to dart swiftly across\r\nthe fiddles and the trumpets and trombones blaze away in a\r\nconflagration, we are all expectant--and even a little fearful, to\r\nobserve his sabre-like cuts. The tension grows ... I hold my breath....\r\nSir Henry snatches a second to throw back a lock of his hair that has\r\nfallen limply across his forehead, then goes on in unrelenting pursuit,\r\ncutting and slashing at hordes of invisible fiends that leap howling out\r\ntowards him. There is a great turmoil of combat, but the Conductor\r\nstruggles on till the great explosion happens. But in spite of that, you\r\nsee him still standing thro' a cloud of great chords, quite undaunted.\r\nHis sword zigzags up and down the scale--suddenly the closed fist of his\r\nleft hand shoots up straight and points to the zenith--like the arm of a\r\nheathen priest appealing to Baal to bring down fire from Heaven.... But\r\nthe appeal avails nought and it looks as tho' it were all up for poor\r\nSir Henry. The music is just as infuriated--his body writhes with\r\nit--the melanic Messiah crucified by the inappeasable desire to express\r\nby visible gestures all that he feels in his heart. He surrenders --so\r\nyou think--he opens out both arms wide and baring his breast, dares them\r\nall to do their worst--like the picture of Moffat the missionary among\r\nthe savages of the Dark Continent!\r\n\r\nAnd yet he wins after all. At the very last moment he seems to summon\r\nall his remaining strength and in one final and devastating sweep mows\r\ndown the orchestra rank by rank.... You awake from the nightmare to\r\ndiscover the victor acknowledging the applause in a series of his\r\ninimitable bows.\r\n\r\nOne ought to pack one's ears up with cotton wool at a concert where Sir\r\nHenry conducts. Otherwise, the music is apt to distract one's attention.\r\nR.L.S. wanted to be at the head of a cavalry charge--sword over\r\nhead--but I'd rather fight an orchestra with a baton.\r\n\r\n_Beethoven's Fifth Symphony_\r\n\r\nThis symphony always works me up into an ecstasy; in ecstatic sympathy\r\nwith its dreadfulness I could stand up in the balcony and fling myself\r\ndown passionately into the arena below. Yet there were women sitting\r\nalongside me to-day--knitting! It so annoyed and irritated me that at\r\nthe end of the first movement I got up and sat elsewhere. They would\r\nhave sat knitting at the foot of the Cross, I suppose.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second movement, two or three other women got up and\r\nwent home to tea! It would have surprised me no more to have seen a cork\r\nextract itself from its bottle and promenade.\r\n\r\n_Tschaikovsky_\r\n\r\nJust lately I've heard a lot of music including Tschaikovsky's\r\nPathétique and Fifth Symphonies, some Debussy, and odd pieces by Dukas,\r\nGlinka, Smetana, Mozart. I am chock-full of impressions of all this\r\nprecious stuff and scarcely know what to write. As usual, the third\r\nmovement of the Pathétique produced a frenzy of exhilaration; I seemed\r\nto put on several inches around my chest and wished to shout in a voice\r\nof thunder. The conventions of a public concert hall are dreadfully\r\noppressive at such times. I could have eaten \"all the elephants of\r\nHindustan and picked my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last movement of the Fifth Symphony of that splendid fellow\r\nTschaikovsky, the orchestra seemed to gallop away leaving poor Landon\r\nRonald to wave his whip in a ridiculously ineffective way. They went on\r\ncrashing down chords, and just before the end I had the awful\r\npresentiment that the orchestra simply could not stop. I sat still\r\nstraining every nerve in the expectancy that this chord or the next or\r\nthe next was the end. But it went on pounding down--each one seemed the\r\nlast but every time another followed as passionate and emphatic as the\r\none before, until finally, whatever this inhuman orchestra was\r\nattempting to crush and destroy must have been reduced to shapeless\r\npulp. I wanted to board the platform and plead with them, elderly\r\ngentlemen turned their heads nervously, everyone was breathless, we all\r\nwanted to call \"For God's sake, stop\"--to do anything to still this\r\nawful lust for annihilation.... The end came quickly in four drum beats\r\nin quick succession. I have never seen such hate, such passionate\r\nintensity of the will to destroy.... And Tschaikovsky was a Russian!\r\n\r\nDebussy was a welcome change. \"L'Après-midi d'un Faun\" is a musical\r\nsetting to an oscitatory exercise. It is an orchestral yawn. Oh! so\r\ntired!\r\n\r\nCame away thoroughly delighted. Wanted to say to every one \"Bally good,\r\nain't it?\" and then we would all shake hands and go home whistling.\r\n\r\n_December_ 14.\r\n\r\nMy rooms are littered with old concert programmes and the Doctor's\r\nprescriptions (in the yellow envelopes of the dispenser) for my various\r\nailments and diseases, and books, books, books.\r\n\r\nAmong the latter those lying on my table at this moment are--\r\n\r\nPlays of M. Brieux.\r\n\r\n_Joseph Vance._\r\n\r\nThe Sequel to _Pragmatism: The Meaning of Truth_, by Wiliam James.\r\n\r\n_Beyond Good and Evil._\r\n\r\nDostoievsky's _The Possessed._\r\n\r\nMarie Bashkirtseff's _Journal._\r\n\r\nI have found time to read only the first chapter of this last and am\r\nalmost afraid to go on. It would be so humiliating to find I was only\r\nher duplicate.\r\n\r\nOn my mantelpiece stands a photograph of Huxley--the hero of my\r\nyouth--which old B---- has always taken to be that of my grandpapa! A\r\nplaster-cast mask of Voltaire when first hung up made him chuckle with\r\nindecent laughter. \"A regular all-nighter. Who is it?\" he said.\r\n\r\n_December_ 15.\r\n\r\n_Petticoat Lane_\r\n\r\nThis morning, being Sunday, went to Petticoat Lane and enjoyed myself.\r\n\r\nOn turning the corner to go into Middlesex Street, as it it now called,\r\nthe first thing I saw was a little girl--a Jewess--being tackled for\r\nselling Belgian button-hole flags by two policemen who ultimately\r\nmarched her off to the police station.\r\n\r\nIn the Lane, first of all, was a \"Royal Ascot Jockey Scales\" made of\r\nbrass and upholstered in gaudy red velvet--a penny a time. A very fat\r\nman was being weighed and looked a little distressed on being given his\r\nticket.\r\n\r\n\"Another stone,\" he told the crowd mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to eat less pork,\" some one volunteered and we all laughed.\r\n\r\nNext door to the Scales was a man selling gyroscopes. \"Something\r\nscientific, amusing as well as instructive, illustrating the principles\r\nof gravity and stability. What I show you is what I sell--price one\r\nshilling. Who?\"\r\n\r\nI stopped next at a stall containing nothing but caps,--\"any size, any\r\ncolour, any pattern, a shilling apiece--now then!\" This show was being\r\nrun by two men--a Jew in a fur cap on one side of the stall and a very\r\npowerful-looking sort of Captain Cuttle on the other--a seafaring man,\r\nalmost as broad as he was long, with a game leg and the voice of a\r\nskipper in a hurricane. Both these men were selling caps at a prodigious\r\npace, and with the insouciance of tradesmen sure of their custom. The\r\nskipper would seize a cap, chuck it across to a timid prospective\r\npurchaser, and, if he dropped it, chuck him over another, crying, with a\r\n\"yo-heave-ho\" boisterousness, \"Oh! what a game, what a bees' nest.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the small head of another customer, he would squash down his\r\nlargest sized cap saying at once,--\r\n\r\n\"There, you look the finest gentleman--oh! ah! a little too large.\"\r\n\r\nAt which we all laughed, the customer looked silly, but took no offence.\r\n\r\n\"Try this,\" yells the skipper above the storm, and takes off his own\r\ncap. \"Oh! ye needn't be afraid--I washed my hair last--year.\"\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nThen to his partner, the Jew on the other side of the stall, \"Oh! what a\r\nface you've got. Here! 6d. for any one who can tell me what it is. Why\r\nnot take it to the trenches and get it smashed in?\"\r\n\r\nThe Jew wore spectacles and had a soft ingratiating voice and brown\r\ndoe-like eyes--a Jew in every respect. \"Oh!\" says he, in the oleaginous\r\nSemitic way, and accurately taking up his cue (for all this was\r\nrehearsed patter), \"my wife says 'my face is my fortune.'\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder you're so hard up and 'ave got to take in lodgers. What's yer\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"John Jones,\" in a demure wheedling voice.\r\n\r\n\"Hoo--that's not your name in your own bloody country--I expect it's\r\nHullabullinsky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what my name really is?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Assenheimopoplocatdwizlinsky Kovorod.\" (Loud laughter.)\r\n\r\n\"I shall call you 'ass' for short.\"\r\n\r\nI was laughing loudly at these two clowns and the skipper observing as\r\nmuch, shouted out to me,--\r\n\r\n\"Parlez-vous Francois, M'sieur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, oui,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! lah, you're one of us--oh! what a game! what a bees' nest,\" and all\r\nthe time he went on selling caps and chucking them at the purchasers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most extraordinary things I saw was a stream of young\r\nmen who, one after another, came up to a stall, paid a penny and\r\nswallowed a glass of \"nerve tonic\"--a green liquid syphoned out of a\r\nlarge jar--warranted a safe cure for\r\n\r\n\"Inward weakness, slightest flurry or body oppressed.\"\r\n\r\nAnother man was pulling teeth and selling tooth powder. Some of the\r\nlittle urchins' teeth, after he had cleaned them as a demonstration,\r\nwere much whiter than their faces or his. This was \"the original Chas.\r\nAssenheim.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Meyers, \"not connected with any one else of the same name in the\r\nLane\" was selling eels at 2d., 3d. and 6d. and doing a brisk trade too.\r\n\r\nBut I should go on for hours if I were to tell everything seen in this\r\nremarkable lane during an hour and a half on a Sunday morning. Each\r\nstall-holder sells only one kind of article--caps or clocks or songs,\r\nbraces, shawls, indecent literature, concertinas, gramophones, coats,\r\npants, reach-me-downs, epergnes. The thoroughfare was crowded with\r\npeople (I saw two Lascars in red fez caps) inspecting the goods\r\ndisplayed and attentively observed by numerous policemen. The alarm\r\nclocks were all going off, each gramophone was working a record (a\r\ndifferent one!) and every tradesman shouting his wares--a perfect\r\npandemonium.\r\n\r\n_December_ 31.\r\n\r\n_A Conversation_\r\n\r\n\"There is that easily calculable element in your nature, dear boy,\" I\r\nsaid, \"by which you forego the dignity of a free-willed human being and\r\ncome under an inflexible natural law. I can anticipate your movements,\r\nintentions, and opinions long beforehand. For example, I know quite well\r\nthat every Saturday morning will see you with _The New Statesman_ under\r\nyour arm; I know that the words 'Wagner' or 'Shaw' uttered slowly and\r\ndeliberately in your ear will produce a perfectly definite reaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"I bet you can't predict what I am going to buy now,\"\r\n\r\nR---- replied gaily, advancing to the newspaper stall.\r\n\r\nHe bought the _Pink 'Un_ and I laughed....\r\n\r\n\"And so you read _Pragmatism_,\" he mused, \"while the fate of the Empire\r\nstands in the balance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"and the Paris Academy of Sciences were discussing the\r\nfunctions of _θ_ and the Polymorphism of Antarctic diatoms last\r\nSeptember when the Germans stood almost at the gates of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a lucky stroke for me, for he knew he was rubbing me on the\r\nraw. We are, of course, great friends, but sometimes we get on one\r\nanother's nerves.\r\n\r\n\"I am polychromatic,\" I declaimed, \"rhetorical, bass. You--besides being\r\na bally fool--are of a pretty gray colour, a baritone and you paint in\r\nwater-colours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereas you, of course, would paint in blood?\" he answered facetiously.\r\n\r\nHis Oxford education has a firm hold on him. He says for example, \"e\r\nconverso\" instead of \"on the other hand\" and \"entre nous\" for \"between\r\nourselves.\" He labels his paragraphs _α, β, γ_, instead of a, b, c, and\r\nquotes Juvenal, knows Paris and Naples, visits the Alps for the winter\r\nsports, all in the approved manner of dons.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently he visits the East End to Study \"how the poor live,\" he\r\nlectures at Toynbee Hall, and calls the proletariat \"the prolly.\" In\r\nfact, he does everything according to the regulations, being a socialist\r\nand an agnostic, a follower of Shaw and a devotee of Bunyan. \"Erotic\" he\r\nis careful to pronounce _eròtic_ to show he knows Greek, and the \"Duma,\"\r\nthe _Dumà_, tho' he doesn't know Russian. Like any don, he is always\r\nready to discuss and give an opinion on any sub- supra- or circum-lunary\r\nsubject from bimetallism to the Symphony as an art-form.\r\n\r\n\"That's a dominant fifth,\" I said to him the other day; no answer.\r\n\r\n\"You ignorant devil,\" I said, \"you don't know what a dominant fifth is!\"\r\n\r\nWe made grimaces at one another.\r\n\r\n\"Who's the Master of the Mint?\" I asked him. \"That is an easy one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Chancellor of the Exchequer,\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that's right,\" I said sarcastic and crestfallen. \"Now tell me the\r\nshortest verse in the Bible and the date of Rameses II.\"\r\n\r\nWe laughed. R---- is a very clever man and the most extraordinarily\r\nversatile man I know. He is bound to make his mark. His danger is--too\r\nmany irons in the fire. Here are some of his occupations and\r\nacquirements: Art (etching, drypoint, water-colours), music (a charming\r\nvoice), classics, French, German, Italian (both speaking and reading\r\nknowledge), biology, etc., etc. He is for ever titillating his mind with\r\nsome new thing. \"For God's sake, do leave it alone--you simply rag your\r\nmind to death. Put it out to grass--go thro' an annual season of\r\ncomplete abstinence from knowledge--an intellectual Lent.\"\r\n\r\nNo one more than he enjoys my ragging him like this--and I do it rather\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"I could eat all the elephants of Hindustan and pick my teeth with\r\nthe Spire of Strassburg Cathedral.\"\r\n\r\n[2] See January 2nd, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1915\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 1.\r\n\r\nI have grown so ridiculously hypercritical and fastidious that I will\r\nrefuse a man's invitation to dinner because he has watery blue eyes, or\r\nhate him for a mannerism or an impediment or affectation in his speech.\r\nSome poor devil who has not heard of Turner or Debussy or Dostoieffsky I\r\ngird at with the arrogance of a knowledgeable youth of 17. Some oddity\r\nwho should afford a sane mind endless amusement, I write off as a _Insus\r\nnaturæ_ and dismiss with a flourish of contempt. My intellectual\r\narrogance--excepting at such times as I become conscious of it and pull\r\nmyself up--is incredible. It is incredible because I have no personal\r\ncourage and all this pride boils up behind a timid exterior. I quail\r\noften before stupid but over-bearing persons who consequently never\r\nrealise my contempt of them. Then afterwards, I writhe to think I never\r\nstood up to this fool; never uttered an appropriate word to interfere\r\nwith another's nauseating self-love. It exasperates me to be unable to\r\ngive a Roland for an Oliver--even servants and underlings \"tick me\r\noff\"--to fail always in sufficient presence of mind to make the\r\nsatisfying rejoinder or riposte. I suffer from such a savage _amour\r\npropre_ that I fear to enter the lists with a man I dislike on account\r\nof the mental anguish I should suffer if he worsted me. I am therefore\r\nbottled up tight--both my hates and loves. For a coward is not only\r\nafraid to tell a man he hates him, but is nervous too of letting go of\r\nhis feeling of affection or regard lest it be rejected or not returned.\r\nI shudder to think of such remarks as (referring to me), \"He's one of my\r\nadmirers, you know\" (sardonically), or, \"I simply can't get rid of him.\"\r\n\r\nIf however my cork _does_ come out, there is an explosion, and placid\r\npeople occasionally marvel to hear violent language streaming from my\r\nlips and nasty acid and facetious remarks.\r\n\r\nOf course, to intimate friends (only about three persons in the wide,\r\nwide world), I can always give free vent to my feelings, and I do so in\r\nprivacy with that violence in which a weak character usually finds some\r\ncompensation for his intolerable self-imposed reserve and restraint in\r\npublic. I can never marvel enough at the ineradicable turpitude of my\r\nexistence, at my _double-facedness_, and the remarkable contrast between\r\nthe face I turn to the outside world and the face my friends know. It's\r\nlike leading a double existence or artificially constructing a puppet to\r\ndangle before the crowd while I fulminate behind the scenes. If only I\r\nhad the moral courage to play my part in life--to take the stage and be\r\nmyself, to enjoy the delightful sensation of making my presence felt,\r\ninstead of this vapourish mumming--then this Journal would be quite\r\nunnecessary. For to me self-expression is a necessity of life, and what\r\ncannot be expressed one way must be expressed in another. When colossal\r\negotism is driven underground, whether by a steely surface environment\r\nor an unworkable temperament or as in my case by both, you get a truly\r\nremarkable result, and the victim a truly remarkable pain--the pain one\r\nmight say of continuously unsuccessful attempts at parturition.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not the whole explanation to say that my milky affability\r\nbefore, say bores or clods is sheer personal cowardice.... It is partly\r\nreal affability. I am so glad to have opposite me some one who is making\r\nhimself pleasant and affable and sympathetic that I forget for the\r\nmoment that he is an unconscionable time-server, a sycophant,\r\nlick-spittle, toady, etc. My first impulse is always to credit folk with\r\nbeing nicer, cleverer, more honest and amiable than they are. Then, on\r\nreflection, I discover unpleasing characteristics, I detect their little\r\nmotives, and hate myself for not speaking. The fellow is intolerable,\r\nwhy did I not tell him so? Bitter recriminations from my critical self\r\nupon my flabby amiable half.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, I lead a pretty disgraceful inner life--excepting\r\nwhen I pull myself together and smile benignly on all things with a\r\nphilosophical smugness, such as is by no means my mood at this present\r\nmoment. I am so envious that a reprint of one of Romney's Ramus girls\r\nsends me into a dry tearless anger--for the moment till I turn over the\r\nnext page.... Inwardly I was exacerbated this morning when R----\r\nrecited, \"Come and have a tiddle at the old Brown Bear,\" and explained\r\nhow a charming \"young person\" sang this at breakfast the other morning.\r\nIt was simply _too_ charming for him to hear.\r\n\r\nTo-night as I brushed my hair, I decided I was quite good-looking, and\r\n_I believe_ I mused that E---- was really a lucky girl.... All that is\r\nthe matter with me is a colossal conceit and a colossal discontent,\r\nqualities exaggerated where a man finds himself in an environment which\r\n....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou observant people will notice that this explanation is something of a\r\nself-defence whereby the virtue goes out of my confession. I plead\r\nguilty, but great and unprecedented provocation as well. Intense pride\r\nof individuality forbids that I should ever be other than, shall I say,\r\namiably disposed towards myself _au fond_, however displeased I may be\r\nwith my environment. It is indeed impossible without sending him to a\r\nlunatic asylum ever to knock a man off the balance of his\r\nself-esteem.... A man's loyalty to himself is the most pig-headed thing\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\n_January_ 2.\r\n\r\n_The Fire Bogey_\r\n\r\n\"This Box contains Manuscripts. One guinea will be paid to any one who\r\nin case of danger from fire saves it from damage or loss.\"\r\n\r\nSigned: W.N.P. BARBELLION.\r\n\r\nI have had this printed in large black characters on a card, framed and\r\nnailed to my \"coffin\" of Journals. I told the printer first to say _Two\r\nGuineas_, but he suggested that One Guinea was quite enough. I agreed\r\nbut wondered how the devil _he_ knew what the Journals were\r\nworth--nobody knows.\r\n\r\nNext month, I expect I shall have a \"hand\" painted on the wall and\r\npointing towards the box. And the month after that I shall hire a\r\nfireman to be on duty night and day standing outside No. 101 in a brass\r\nhelmet and his hatchet up at the salute.\r\n\r\nThese precious Journals! Supposing I lost them! I cannot imagine the\r\nanguish it would cause me. It would be the death of my real self and as\r\nI should take no pleasure in the perpetuation of my flabby, flaccid,\r\nanæmic, amiable puppet-self, I should probably commit suicide.\r\n\r\n_August_ 7.\r\n\r\nHarvey who discovered the circulation of the blood also conducted a\r\ngreat many investigations into the Anatomy and development of insects.\r\nBut all his MSS. and drawings disappeared in the fortunes of war, and\r\none half of his life work thus disappeared. This makes me feverish,\r\nliving as I do in Armageddon!\r\n\r\nAgain, all Malpighi's pictures, furniture, books and MSS. were destroyed\r\nin a lamentable fire at his house in Bononia, occasioned it is said by\r\nthe negligence of his old wife.\r\n\r\nAbout 1618, Ben Jonson suffered a similar calamity thro' a fire breaking\r\nout in his study. Many unpublished MSS. perished.\r\n\r\nA more modern and more tragic example I found recently in the person of\r\nan Australian naturalist, Dr. Walter Stimpson, who lost all his MSS.,\r\ndrawings, and collections in the great fire of Chicago, and was so\r\nexcoriated by this irreparable misfortune that he never recovered from\r\nthe shock, and died the following year a broken man and unknown.\r\n\r\nOf course the housemaid who lit the fire with the _French Revolution_ is\r\nknown to all, as well as Newton's \"Fido, Fido, you little know what you\r\nhave done.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many dangers in preserving the labours of years in MS. form.\r\nSamuel Butler (of _Erewhon_) advised writing in copying ink and then\r\npressing off a second copy to be kept in another and separate locality.\r\nMy own precautions for these Journals are more elaborate. Those who know\r\nabout it think I am mad. I wonder.... But I dare say I am a pathetic\r\nfool--an incredible self-deceiver!\r\n\r\nAnyhow--the \"coffin\" of raw material I sent down to T---- while I retain\r\nthe two current volumes. This is to avoid Zeppelins. E---- took the\r\n\"coffin\" down for me on her way home from school, and at Taunton,\r\ninquisitive porters mistaking it, I suppose, for an infant's coffin\r\ncarried it reverently outside the station and laid it down. She caught\r\nthem looking at it just in time before her train left. Under her\r\ninstructions they seized it by the brass handles and carried it back\r\nagain. I sit now and with a good deal of curiosity fondle the idea of\r\nporters carrying about my Journals of confession. It's like being\r\ntickled in the palm of the hand.... Two volumes of abstracted entries I\r\nkeep here, and, as soon as I am married, I intend to make a second copy\r\nof these.... Then all in God's good time I intend getting a volume ready\r\nfor publication.\r\n\r\n_January_ 30.\r\n\r\n_Hearing Beethoven_\r\n\r\nTo the Queen's Hall and heard Beethoven's Fifth and Seventh Symphonies.\r\n\r\nBefore the concert began I was in a fever. I kept on saying to myself,\r\n\"I am going to hear the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies.\" I regarded myself\r\nwith the most ridiculous self-adulation--I smoothed and purred over\r\nmyself--a great contented Tabby cat--and all because I was so splendidly\r\nfortunate as to be about to hear Beethoven's Fifth and Seventh\r\nSymphonies.\r\n\r\nIt certainly upset me a little to find there were so many other people\r\nwho were singularly fortunate as well, and it upset me still more to\r\nfind some of them knitting and some reading newspapers as if they waited\r\nfor sausage and mashed.\r\n\r\nHow I gloried in the Seventh! I can't believe there was any one present\r\nwho gloried in it as I did! To be processing majestically up the steps\r\nof a great, an unimaginable palace (in the \"Staircase\" introduction),\r\nled by Sir Henry, is to have had at least a crowded ten minutes of\r\nglorious life--a suspicion crossed the mind at one time \"Good Heavens,\r\nthey're going to knight me.\" I cannot say if that were their intentions.\r\nBut I escaped however....\r\n\r\nI love the way in which a beautiful melody flits around the Orchestra\r\nand its various components like a beautiful bird.\r\n\r\n_January_ 19.\r\n\r\n_An Average Day_\r\n\r\nAfter a morning of very mixed emotions and more than one annoyance ...\r\nat last sat down to lunch and a little peace and quiet with R----. We\r\nbegan by quoting verse at one another in open competition. Of course\r\nneither of us listened to the other's verses. We merely enjoyed the\r\npleasure of recollecting and repeating our own. I began with Tom Moore's\r\n\"Row gently here, my Gondolier.\" R---- guessed the author rightly at\r\nonce and fidgeted until he burst out with, \"The Breaths of kissing night\r\nand day\"--to me an easy one. I gave, \"The Moon more indolently sleeps\r\nto-night\" (Baudelaire), and in reply he did a great stroke by reciting\r\nsome of the old French of Frangois Villon which entirely flummuxed me.\r\n\r\nI don't believe we really love each other, but we cling to each other\r\nout of ennui and discover in each other a certain cold intellectual\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nAt the pay desk (Lyons' is our rendezvous) we joked with the cashier--a\r\ncheerful, fat little girl, who said to R---- (indicating me),--\r\n\r\n\"He's a funny boy, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous,\" chirped R----, and we laughed. In the street we met an\r\naged, decrepit newsvendor--very dirty and ragged--but his voice was\r\nunexpectedly fruity.\r\n\r\n\"British Success,\" he called, and we stopped for the sake of the voice.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not interested,\" I said--as an appetiser.\r\n\r\n\"What! Not.... Just one sir: I haven't sold a single copy yet, and I've\r\na wife and four children.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nothing to me--I've three wives and forty children,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" in affected surprise, turning to R----, \"he's Brigham Young from\r\nSalt Lake City. Yes I know it--I've been there myself and been dry ever\r\nsince. Give us a drink, sir--just one.\"\r\n\r\nIn consideration of his voice we gave him 2d. and passed on....\r\n\r\nAfter giving a light to a Belgian soldier whose cigarette had gone out,\r\nfarther along we entered a queer old music shop where they sell\r\nflageolets, serpents, clavichords, and harps. We had previously made an\r\nappointment with the man to have Schubert's Unfinished Symphony played\r\nto us, so as to recall one or two of the melodies which we can't recall\r\nand it drives us crazy. \"What is that one in the second movement which\r\ngoes like this?\" and R---- whistled a fragment. \"I don't know,\" I said,\r\n\"but let's go in here and ask.\" In the shop, a youth was kind enough to\r\nsay that if we cared to call next day, Madame A----, the harp player\r\nwould be home and would be ready to play us the symphony.\r\n\r\nSo this morning, before Madame's appearance, this kind and obliging\r\nyouth put a gramophone record of it on, to which we listened like two\r\nintelligent parrots with heads sideways. Presently, the fat lady harpist\r\nappeared and asked us just what we wanted to find out--a rather awkward\r\nquestion for us, as we did not want to \"find out\" anything excepting how\r\nthe tunes went.\r\n\r\nI therefore explained that as neither of us had sisters or wives, and we\r\nboth wanted, etc.... so would she...? In response, she smiled\r\npleasantly and played us the second movement on a shop piano. Meanwhile,\r\nHenry the boy, hid himself behind the instruments at the rear of the\r\nshop and as we signed to her she would say,--\r\n\r\n\"What's that, Henry?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Henry would duly answer from his obscurity, \"Wood wind,\" or \"Solo\r\noboe,\" or whatever it was, and the lad really spoke with authority. In\r\nthis way, I began to find out something about the work. Before I left, I\r\npresented her with a copy of the score, which she did not possess and\r\nbecause she would not accept any sort of remuneration.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you put your name on it?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\nI pointed gaily to the words \"Ecce homo,\" which I had scribbled across\r\nSchubert's name and said, \"There you are.\" Madame smiled incredulously\r\nand we said, \"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a beautifully clement almost springlike day, and at the street\r\ncorner, in a burst of joyousness, we each bought a bunch of violets of\r\nan old woman, stuck them on the ends of our walking-sticks, and marched\r\noff with them in triumphant protest to the B.M. Carried over our\r\nshoulders, our flowers amused the police and ----, who scarcely realised\r\nthe significance of the ritual. \"This is my protest,\" said R----,\r\n\"against the war. It's like Oscar Wilde's Sunflower.\"\r\n\r\nOn the way, we were both bitterly disappointed at a dramatic meeting\r\nbetween a man and woman of the artizan class which instead of beginning\r\nwith a stormy, \"Robert, where's the rent, may I ask?\" fizzled out into,\r\n\"Hullo, Charlie, why you _are_ a stranger.\"\r\n\r\nAt tea in the A.B.C. shop, we had a violent discussion on Socialism, and\r\non the station platform, going home, I said that before marriage I\r\nintended saving up against the possibility of divorce--a domestic\r\ndivorce fund.\r\n\r\n\"Very dreadful,\" said R---- with mock gravity, \"to hear a recently\r\naffianced young man talk like that.\"\r\n\r\n... What should I do then? Marry? I suppose so. Shadows of the\r\nprison-house. At first I said I ought not to marry for two years. Then\r\nwhen I am wildly excited with her I say \"next week.\" We could. There are\r\nno arrangements to be made. All her furniture--flat, etc. But I feel we\r\nought to wait until the War is over.\r\n\r\nAt dinner-time to-night I was feverish to do three things at once: write\r\nout my day's Journal, eat my food, and read the _Journal_ of Marie\r\nBashkirtseff. Did all three--but unfortunately not at once, so that when\r\nI was occupied with one I would surreptitiously cast a glance sideways\r\nat the other--and repined.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, paid a visit to the ---- and found Mrs. ---- playing Patience.\r\nI told her that 12,000 lives had been lost in the great Italian\r\nearthquake. Still going on dealing out the cards, she said in her gentle\r\nvoice that that was dreadful and still absorbed in her cards inquired if\r\nearthquakes had aught to do with the weather.\r\n\r\n\"An earthquake must be a dreadful thing,\" she gently piped, as she\r\nabstractedly dealt out the cards for a new game in a pretty\r\nMorris-papered room in Kensington.\r\n\r\n_January_ 20.\r\n\r\n_At a Public Dinner_\r\n\r\n... The timorous man presently took out his cigarette-case and was going\r\nto take out a cigarette, when he recollected that he ought first to\r\noffer one to the millionaire on his right. Fortunately the cigarette\r\ncase was silver and the cigarettes appeared--from my side of the\r\ndinner-table--to be fat Egyptians. Yet the timorous and unassuming\r\nbug-hunter hesitated palpably. Ought he to offer his cigarettes? He\r\nthought of his own balance at the bank and then of the millionaire's and\r\ntrembled. The case after all was only silver and the cigarettes were not\r\nmuch more than a halfpenny each. Was it not impertinent? He sat a moment\r\nstudying the open case which he held in both hands like a hymn book,\r\nwhile the millionaire ordered not wines--but a bass! At last courage\r\ncame, and he inoffensively pushed the cigarettes towards his friend.\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks!\" smiled the millionaire, \"I don't smoke.\" And so, 'twas a\r\nunicorn dilemma after all.\r\n\r\n_February_ 15.\r\n\r\nSpent Xmas week at work in her studio, transcribing my Journals while\r\nshe made drawings. All unbeknown to her I was copying out entries of\r\ndays gone by--how scandalised she would be if...!\r\n\r\n_February_ 22.\r\n\r\nWhat an amazing Masque is Rotten Row on a Sunday morning! I sat on a\r\nseat there this morning and watched awhile.\r\n\r\nIt was most exasperating to be in this kaleidoscope of human life\r\nwithout the slightest idea as to who they all were. One man in\r\nparticular, I noticed--a first-class \"swell\"--whom I wanted to touch\r\ngently on the arm, slip a half-a-crown into his hand and whisper,\r\n\"There, tell me all about yourself.\"\r\n\r\nSuch \"swells\" there were that out in the fairway, my little cockle-shell\r\nboat was wellnigh swamped. To be in the wake of a really magnificent\r\nDuchess simply rocks a small boat in an alarming fashion. I leaned over\r\nmy paddles and gazed up. They steamed past unheeding, but I kept my\r\nnerve all right and pulled in and out quizzing and observing.\r\n\r\nIt is nothing less than scandalous that here I am aged 25 with no means\r\nof acquainting myself with contemporary men and women even of my own\r\nrank and station. The worst of it is, too, that I have no time to\r\nlose--in my state of health. This accursed ill-health cuts me off from\r\neverything. I make pitiful attempts to see the world around me by an\r\noccasional visit (wind, weather, and health permitting) to Petticoat\r\nLane, the Docks, Rotten Row, Leicester Square, or the Ethical Church.\r\nTo-morrow I purpose going to the Christian Scientists'. Meanwhile, the\r\nothers participate in Armageddon.\r\n\r\n_February_ 23.\r\n\r\n_Looking for Lice at the Zoo_\r\n\r\nThe other day went to the Zoological Gardens, and, by permission of the\r\nSecretary, went round with the keepers and searched the animals for\r\nectoparasites.\r\n\r\nSome time this year I have to make a scientific Report to the Zoological\r\nSociety upon all the Lice which from time to time have been collected on\r\nanimals dying in the gardens and sent me for study and determination.\r\n\r\nWe entered the cages, caught and examined several Tinamous,\r\n_Rhinochetus, Eurypygia_, and many more, to the tune of \"The Policeman's\r\nHoliday\" whistled by a Mynah! It was great fun.\r\n\r\nThen we went into the Ostrich House and thoroughly searched two Kiwis.\r\nThese, being nocturnal birds, were roosting underneath a heap of straw.\r\nWhen we had finished investigating their feathers, they ran back to\r\ntheir straw at once, the keeper giving them a friendly tap on the rear\r\nto hurry them up a bit. They are just like little old women bundling\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nThe Penguins, of course, were the most amusing, and, after operating\r\nfruitlessly for some time on a troublesome Adèle, I was amused to find,\r\non turning around, all the other Adèles clustered close around my feet\r\nin an attitude of mute supplication.\r\n\r\nThe Armadillo required all the strength of two keepers to hold still\r\nwhile I went over his carcass with lens and forceps. I was also allowed\r\nto handle and examine the Society's two specimens of that amazing\r\ncreature the _Echidna_.\r\n\r\n_Balœniceps rex_ like other royalty had to be approached decorously. He\r\nwas a big, ill-tempered fellow, and quite unmanageable except by one\r\nkeeper for whom he showed a preference. While we other conspirators hid\r\nourselves outside, this man entered the house quietly and approached the\r\nbird with a gentle cooing sound. Then suddenly he grabbed the bill and\r\nheld on. We entered at the same moment and secured the wings, and I\r\nbegan the search--without any luck. We must have made an amusing\r\npicture--three men holding on for dear life to a tall, grotesque bird\r\nwith an imperial eye, while a fourth searched the feathers for\r\nparasites!\r\n\r\n_February_ 28.\r\n\r\nWhat a boon is Sunday! I can get out of bed just when the spirit moves\r\nme, dress and bath leisurely, even with punctilio. How nice to dawdle in\r\nthe bath with a cigarette, to hear the holiday sound of Church bells!\r\nThen comes that supreme moment when, shaven, clean, warm and hungry for\r\nbreakfast and coffee, I stand a moment before the looking-glass and comb\r\nout my towzled hair with a parting as straight as a line in Euclid. That\r\ngives the finishing touch of self-satisfaction, and I go down to\r\nbreakfast ready for the day's pleasure. I hate this weekday strain of\r\nhaving to be always each day at a set time in a certain place.\r\n\r\n_March_ 3.\r\n\r\nI often sit in my room at the B.M. and look out at the traffic with a\r\nglassy, mesmerised face--a fainéant. How different from that extremely\r\nbusy youth who came to London in 1912. Say--could that lad be I? How\r\nmany hours do I waste day-dreaming. This morning I dreamed and dreamed\r\nand could not stop dreaming--I had not the will to shake myself down to\r\nmy task.... My memories simply trooped the colour.\r\n\r\nIt surprised me to find how many of them had gone out of my present\r\nconsciousness and with what poignancy of feeling I recognised them\r\nagain! How selfishly for the most part we all live in our present selves\r\nor in the selves that are to be.\r\n\r\nThen I raced thro' all sorts of future possibilities--oh! when and how\r\nis it all going to end? How do you expect me to settle down to\r\nscientific research with all this internal unrest! The scientific man\r\nabove all should possess the \"quiet mind in all changes of fortune\"--Sir\r\nHenry Wotton's _How happy is he born and taught_.\r\n\r\nThe truth is I am a hybrid: a mixture of two very distinct temperaments\r\nand they are often at war. To keep two different natures and two\r\ndifferent mental habits simultaneously at work is next to impossible.\r\nConsequently plenty of waste and fever and--as I might have discovered\r\nearlier for myself--success almost out of the question. If only I were\r\npure-bred science or pure-bred art!\r\n\r\n_March_ 4.\r\n\r\nLife is a dream and we are all somnambuloes. We know that for a fact at\r\nall times when we are most intensely alive--at crises of unprecedented\r\nchange, in sorrow or catastrophe, or in any unusual incident brought\r\nswiftly to a close like a vision!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI sit here writing this--a mirage! Who am I? No one can say. What am I?\r\n\"A soap-bubble hanging from a reed.\"\r\n\r\nEvery man is an inexhaustible treasury of human personality. He can go\r\non burrowing in it for an eternity if he have the desire--and a taste\r\nfor introspection. I like to keep myself well within the field of the\r\nmicroscope, and, with as much detachment as I can muster, to watch\r\nmyself live, to report my observations of what I say, feel, think. In\r\ndefault of others, I am myself my own spectator and\r\nself-appreciator--critical, discerning, vigilant, fond!--my own stupid\r\nBoswell, shrewd if silly. This spectator of mine, it seems to me, must\r\nbe a very moral gentleman and eminently superior. His incessant\r\nattentions, while I go on my way misconducting myself, goad me at times\r\ninto a surly, ill-tempered outbreak, like Dr. Johnson. I hate being\r\nshadowed and reported like this. Yet on the whole--like old Samuel\r\nagain--I am rather pleased to be Boswelled. It flatters me to know that\r\nat least one person takes an unremitting interest in all my ways.\r\n\r\nAnd, mind you, there are people who have seen most things but have never\r\nseen themselves walking across the stage of life. If someone shows them\r\nglimpses of themselves they will not recognise the likeness. How do you\r\nwalk? Do you know your own idiosyncrasies of gait, manner of speech,\r\netc.?\r\n\r\nI never cease to interest myself in the Gothic architecture of my own\r\nfantastic soul.[1]\r\n\r\n_March_ 6.\r\n\r\n_The Punch and Judy Show_\r\n\r\nSpent a most delightful half-an-hour to-day reading an account in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_ (one of my favourite books--it's so \"gey\r\ndisconnekkit\") the history of the Punch and Judy Show. It's a delightful\r\nbit of antiquarian lore and delighted me the more because it had never\r\noccurred to me before that it had an ancient history. I am thoroughly\r\nproud of this recent acquisition of knowledge and as if it were a\r\nvaluable freehold I have been showing it off saying, \"Rejoice with\r\nme--see what I have got here.\" I fired it off first in detail at ----;\r\nand H---- and D---- will probably be my victims to-morrow. After all, it\r\nis a charming little cameo of history: compact, with plenty of scope for\r\nconjecture, theory, research, and just that combination of all three\r\nwhich would suit my taste and capacity if I had time for a Monograph.\r\n\r\n_March_ 22\r\n\r\nI waste much time gaping and wondering. During a walk or in a book or in\r\nthe middle of an embrace, suddenly I awake to a stark amazement at\r\neverything. The bare fact of existence paralyses me--holds my mind in\r\nmort-main. To be alive is so incredible that all I do is to lie still\r\nand merely breathe--like an infant on its back in a cot. It is\r\nimpossible to be interested in anything in particular while overhead the\r\nsun shines or underneath my feet grows a single blade of grass. \"The\r\nthings immediate to be done,\" says Thoreau, \"I could give them all up to\r\nhear this locust sing.\" All my energies become immobilised, even my\r\nself-expression frustrated. I could not exactly master and describe how\r\nI feel during such moments.\r\n\r\n_March_ 23.\r\n\r\n_Johnson_ v. _Yves Delage_\r\n\r\nI expect we have all of us at one time or another heard ourselves\r\naddressing to annoying, objectionable acquaintances some such stinging\r\ncastigation as Hazlitt's letter to Gifford, or Burke's letter to a Noble\r\nLord, or Johnson's letter to Lord Chesterfield, or Rousseau's letter to\r\nthe Archbishop of Paris. If only I could indulge myself! At this moment\r\nI could glut my rancours on six different persons at least!\r\n\r\nWhat a raging discontent I have suffered to-day! What cynicism, what\r\nbitterness of spirit, what envy, hate, exasperation, childish petulance,\r\nwhat pusillanimous feelings and desires, what crude efforts to flout\r\nsimple, ingenuous folk with my own thwarted, repressed\r\nself-assertiveness!\r\n\r\nA solemn fellow told me he had heard from Johnson who said he had\r\nalready had much success from collecting in moss.[2] With an icy\r\npoliteness I asked who Johnson was. Who the Hell is Johnson? As a _quid\r\npro quo_ I began to talk of Yves Delage, which left him as much in the\r\ndark as he left me. Our Gods differ, we have a different hierarchy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how's your soul?\" said R----, bursting in with a sardonic smile.\r\n\r\nI gave him a despairing look and said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! a pink one with blue spots,\" and he left me to my fate.\r\n\r\nHad tea with the ---- and was amazed to find on the music tray in the\r\ndrawing-room of these inoffensive artists a copy of ----'s Memoir on\r\n_Synapta_. Within his hearing, I said, \"Did you and Mrs. ---- find this\r\nexciting reading?\" And I held it up with a sneer. I felt I had laid bare\r\na nerve and forthwith proceeded to make it twinge. ----, of course, was\r\nglib with an explanation, yet the question remains incalculable--just\r\nhow pleased that young man is with himself.\r\n\r\nAfter tea went out into the Studio and watched these two enthusiasts\r\npaint. I must have glowered at them. I--the energetic, ambitious,\r\npushing youth--of necessity sitting down doing nought, as unconsidered\r\nas a child playing on the floor. I recollected my early days in my attic\r\nlaboratory and sighed. Where is my energy now?\r\n\r\nMrs. ---- plays Chopin divinely well. How I envied this man--to have a\r\nwife play you Chopin!\r\n\r\n_March_ 24.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate I am ill in one way for I need not make my mind up about\r\nthis War. I am not interested in it--this filth and lunacy. I have not\r\nyet made up my mind about myself. I am so steeped in myself--in my\r\nmoods, vapours, idiosyncrasies, so self-sodden, that I am unable to\r\nstand clear of the data, to marshal and classify the multitude of facts\r\nand thence draw the deduction what manner of man I am. I should like to\r\nknow--if only as a matter of curiosity. So what in God's name am I? A\r\nfool, of course, to start with--but the rest of the diagnosis?\r\n\r\nOne feature is my incredible levity about serious matters. Nothing\r\nmatters, provided the tongue is not furred. I have coquetted with death\r\nfor so long now, and endured such prodigious ill-health that my main\r\nidea when in a fair state of repair is to seize the passing moment and\r\nsqueeze it dry. The thing that counts is to be drunken; as Baudelaire\r\nsays, \"One must be for ever drunken; that is the sole question of\r\nimportance. If you would not feel the horrible burden of time that\r\nbruises your shoulders and bends you to the earth, you must be drunken\r\nwithout cease.\"\r\n\r\nAnother feature is my insatiable curiosity. My purpose is to move about\r\nin this ramshackle, old curiosity shop of a world sampling existence. I\r\nwould try everything, meddle lightly with everything. Religions and\r\nphilosophies I devour with a relish, Pragmatism and Bishop Berkeley and\r\nBergson have been my favourite bagatelles in turn. My consciousness is a\r\nragbag of things: all quips, quirks, and quillets, all excellent passes\r\nof pate, all the \"obsolete curiosities of an antiquated cabinet\" take my\r\neye for a moment ere I pass on. In Sir Thomas Browne's _Pseudodoxia_, I\r\nam interested to find \"why Jews do not stink, what is the superstition\r\nof sneezing after saluting, wherefore negroes are black,\" and so forth.\r\nThere is a poetic appropriateness that in A.D. 1915 I should be occupied\r\nmainly in the study of Lice. I like the insolence of it.\r\n\r\nThey tell me that if the Germans won it would put back the clock of\r\ncivilisation for a century. But what is a meagre 100 years? Consider the\r\ndate of the first Egyptian dynasty! We are now only in A.D. 1915--surely\r\nwe could afford to chuck away a century or two? Why not evacuate the\r\nwhole globe and give the ball to the Boches to play with--just as an\r\nexperiment to see what they can make of it. After all there is no\r\ndesperate hurry. Have we a train to catch? Before I could be serious\r\nenough to fight, I should want God first to dictate to me his programme\r\nof the future of mankind.\r\n\r\n_March_ 25.\r\n\r\nOften in the middle of a quite vivid ten seconds of life, I find I have\r\nswitched myself off from myself to make room for the person of a\r\ndisinterested and usually vulgar spectator. Even in the thrill of a\r\ndevotional kiss I have overheard myself saying, \"Hot stuff, this witch.\"\r\nOr in a room full of agreeable and pleasant people, while I am being as\r\nagreeable as I know how, comes the whisper in a cynical tone, \"These\r\ndamned women.\" I am apparently a triple personality:\r\n\r\n(1) The respectable youth.\r\n\r\n(2) The foul-mouthed commentator and critic.\r\n\r\n(3) The real but unknown I.\r\n\r\nCurious that these three should live together amiably in the same\r\ntenement!\r\n\r\n_In a Crowd_\r\n\r\nA crowd makes egotists of us all. Most men find it repugnant to them to\r\nsubmerge themselves in a sea of their fellows. A silent, listening crowd\r\nis potentially full of commotion. Some poor devils suffocating and\r\nunable any longer to bear the strain will shout, \"Bravo,\" or \"Hear,\r\nhear,\" at every opportunity. At the feeblest joke we all laugh loudly,\r\nwelcoming this means of self-survival. Hence the success of the\r\nSalvation Army. To be preached at and prayed for in the mass for long on\r\nend is what human nature can't endure in silence and a good deal of self\r\ncan be smuggled by an experienced Salvationist into \"Alleluia\" or \"The\r\nLord be praised.\"\r\n\r\n_Naming Cockroaches_\r\n\r\nI had to determine the names of some exotic cockroaches to-day and\r\nfinding it very difficult and dull raised a weak smile in two\r\nenthusiasts who know them as \"Blattids\" by rechristening them with great\r\nfrivolity, \"Fat 'eds.\"\r\n\r\n\"These bloody insects,\" I said to an Australian entomologist of rare\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\"A good round oath,\" he answered quietly.\r\n\r\n\"If it was a square one it wouldn't roll properly,\" I said. It is nice\r\nto find an entomologist with whom I can swear and talk bawdy.\r\n\r\n_March_ 26.\r\n\r\n_A Test of Happiness_\r\n\r\nThe true test of happiness is whether you know what day of the week it\r\nis. A miserable man is aware of this even in his sleep. To be as\r\ncheerful and rosy-cheeked on Monday as on Saturday, and at breakfast as\r\nat dinner is to--well, make an ideal husband.\r\n\r\n... It is a strange metempsychosis, this transformation of an\r\nenthusiast--tense, excitable, and active, into a sceptic, nerveless,\r\nironical, and idle. That's what ill-health can do for a man. To be among\r\nenthusiasts--zoologists, geologists, entomologists--as I frequently am,\r\nmakes me feel a very old man, regarding them as children, and provokes\r\npainful retrospection and sugary sentimentality over my past flame now\r\nburnt out.\r\n\r\nI do wonder where I shall end up; what shall I be twenty years hence? It\r\nalarms me to find I am capable of such remarkable changes in character.\r\nI am fluid and can be poured into any mould. I have moments when I see\r\nin myself the most staggering possibilities. I could become a wife\r\nbeater, and a drug-taker (especially the last). My curiosity is often\r\nsuch a ridiculous weakness that I have found myself playing Peeping Tom\r\nand even spying into private documents. In a railway carriage I will\r\ntwist my neck and risk any rudeness to see the title of the book my\r\nneighbour is reading or how the letter she is reading begins.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" asks Samuel Butler, \"should not chicken be born and clergymen be\r\nlaid and hatched? Or why, at any rate, should not the clergyman be born\r\nfull grown and in Holy Orders not to say already beneficed? The present\r\narrangement is not convenient ... it is not only not perfect but so much\r\nthe reverse that we could hardly find words to express our sense of its\r\nawkwardness if we could look upon it with new eyes....\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as we are born, if we could but get up, bathe, dress, shave,\r\nbreakfast once for all, if we could \"cut\" these monotonous cycles of\r\nroutine. If once the sun rose it would stay up, or once we were alive we\r\nwere immortal!--how much forrarder we should all get--always at the\r\nheart of things, working without let or hindrance in a straight line for\r\nthe millennium! Now we waltz along instead. Even planets die off and new\r\nones come in their place. How infinitely wearisome it seems. When an old\r\nman dies what a waste, and when a baby is born what a redundancy of\r\nlabour in front!\r\n\r\n_Two People I hate in particular_\r\n\r\nThe man walking along the pavement in front of me giving me no room to\r\npass under the satisfactory impression that he is the only being on the\r\npavement or in the street, city, country, world, universe: and it all\r\nbelongs to him even the moon and sun and stars.\r\n\r\nThe woman on the 'bus the other night--pouring out an interminable flow\r\nof poisonous chatter into the ear of her man--poor, exhausted devil who\r\nkept answering dreamily \"Oom\" and\"Yes\" and \"Oom\"--how I hated her for\r\nhis sake!\r\n\r\n_April_ 11.\r\n\r\n_Beethoven's Fifth Symphony_\r\n\r\nIf music moves me, it always generates images--a procession of\r\napparently disconnected images in my mind. In the Fifth Symphony, for\r\nexample, as soon as the first four notes are sounded and repeated, this\r\nmagic population springs spontaneously into being. A nude,\r\nterror-stricken figure in headlong flight with hands pressed to the ears\r\nand arms bent at the elbows--a staring, bulgy-eyed mad-woman such as one\r\nsees in Raemakers' cartoons of the Belgian atrocities. A man in the\r\nfirst onset of mental agony on hearing sentence of death passed upon\r\nhim. A wounded bird, fluttering and flopping in the grass. It is the\r\nstruggle of a man with a steam-hammer--Fate. As tho' thro' the walls of\r\na closed room--some mysterious room, a fearful spot--I crouch and listen\r\nand am conscious that inside some brutal punishment is being meted out\r\n--there are short intervals, then unrelenting pursuit, then hammerlike\r\nblows--melodramatic thuds, terrible silences (I crouch and wonder what\r\nhas happened), and the pursuit begins again. I see clasped hands and\r\nappealing eyes and feel very helpless and mystified outside. An\r\nepileptic vision or an opium dream--_Dostoievsky_ or De Quincey set to\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Movement the man is broken, an unrecognisable vomit. I see\r\na pale youth sitting with arms hanging limply between the knees, hands\r\nfolded, and with sad, impenetrable eyes that have gazed on unspeakable\r\nhorrors. I see the brave, tearful smile, the changed life after personal\r\ncatastrophe, the Cross held before closing eyes, sudden absences of\r\nmind, reveries, poignant retrospects, the rustle of a dead leaf of\r\nthought at the bottom of the heart, the tortuous pursuit of past\r\nincidents down into the silence of yesterday, the droning of comfortable\r\nwords, the painful collection of the wreckage of a life with intent to\r\n\"carry on\" for a while in duty bound, for the widow consolation in the\r\nchild; a greyhound's cold wet nose nozzling into a listless hand, and\r\noutside a Thrush singing after the storm, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Third Movement comes the crash by which I know something final\r\nand dreadful has happened. Then the resurrection with commotion in\r\nHeaven: tempests and human faces, scurryings to and fro, brazen\r\nportcullises clanging to, never to open more, the distant roll of drums\r\nand the sound of horses' hoofs. From behind the inmost veil of Heaven I\r\nfaintly catch the huzzas of a great multitude. Then comes a great\r\nhealing wind, then a few ghost-like tappings on the window pane till\r\ngradually the Avenue of Arches into Heaven come into view with a solemn\r\ncortege advancing slowly along.\r\n\r\nAbove the great groundswell of woe, Hope is restored and the Unknown\r\nHero enters with all pomp into his Kingdom, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nI am not surprised to learn that Beethoven was once on the verge of\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n_April_ 15.\r\n\r\nThere is an absurd fellow ... who insists on taking my pirouettes\r\nseriously. I say irresponsibly, \"All men are liars,\" and he replies with\r\njejuneness and exactitude of a pronouncing dictionary, \"A liar is one\r\nwho makes a false statement with intent to deceive.\" What can I do with\r\nhim? \"Did I ever meet a lady,\" he asked, \"who wasn't afraid of mice?\" \"I\r\ndon't know,\" I told him, \"I never experiment with ladies in that way.\"\r\n\r\nHe hates me.\r\n\r\n_May_ 11.\r\n\r\nThis mysterious world makes me chilly. It is chilly to be alive among\r\nghosts in a nightmare of calamity. This Titanic war reduces me to the\r\nsize and importance of a debilitated housefly. So what is a poor egotist\r\nto do? To be a common soldier is to become a pawn in the game between\r\nambitious dynasts and their ambitious marshals. You lose all\r\nindividuality, you become a \"bayonet\" or a \"machine gun,\" or \"cannon\r\nfodder,\" or \"fighting material.\"\r\n\r\n_May_ 22.\r\n\r\nGenerosity may be only weakness, philanthropy (beautiful word),\r\nself-advertisement, and praise of others sheer egotism. One can almost\r\nhear a eulogist winding himself up to strike his eulogy that comes out\r\nsententious, pompous, and full of self.\r\n\r\n_May_ 23.\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of Lermontov by Maurice Baring:\r\n\r\n\"He had except for a few intimate friends an impossible temperament; he\r\nwas proud, over-bearing, exasperated and exasperating, filled with a\r\nsavage _amour-propre_ and he took a childish delight in annoying; he\r\ncultivated 'le plaisir aristocratique de déplaire.' ... He could not\r\nbear not to make himself felt and if he felt he was unsuccessful in this\r\nby fair means he resorted to unpleasant ones. Yet he was warm-hearted,\r\nthirsting for love and kindness and capable of giving himself up to love\r\nif he chose.... At the bottom of all this lay no doubt a deep-seated\r\ndisgust with himself and with the world in general, and a complete\r\nindifference to life resulting from large aspirations which could not\r\nfind an outlet and recoiled upon himself.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an accurate description of Me.\r\n\r\n_May_ 26.\r\n\r\nThe time will come--it's a great way off--when a joke about sex will be\r\nnot so much objectionable as unintelligible. Thanks to Christian\r\nteaching, a nude body is now an obscenity, of the congress of the sexes\r\nit is indecent to speak and our birth is a corruption. Hence come a\r\nlegion of evils: reticence, therefore ignorance and therefore venereal\r\ndisease; prurience especially in adolescence, poisonous literature, and\r\ndirty jokes. The mind is contaminated from early youth; even the\r\nhealthiest-minded girl will blush at the mention of _the wonder of\r\ncreation_. Yet to the perfectly enfranchised mind it should be as\r\nimpossible to joke about sex as about mind or digestion or physiology.\r\nThe perfectly enfranchised poet--and Walt Whitman in \"The Song of\r\nMyself\" came near being it--should be as ready to sing of the incredible\r\nraptures of the sexual act between \"twin souls\" as of the clouds or\r\nsunshine. Every man or woman who has loved has a heart full of beautiful\r\nthings to say but no man dare--for fear of the police, for fear of the\r\ncoarse jests of others and even of a breakdown in his own\r\nhighmindedness. I wonder just how much wonderful lyric poetry has thus\r\nbeen lost to the world!\r\n\r\n_May_ 27.\r\n\r\n_The Pool: A Retrospect_\r\n\r\nFrom above, the pool looked like any little innocent sheet of water. But\r\ndown in the hollow itself it grew sinister. The villagers used to say\r\nand to believe that it had no bottom and certainly a very great depth\r\nin it could be _felt_ if not accurately gauged as one stood at the\r\nwater's edge. A long time ago, it was a great limestone quarry, but\r\nto-day the large mounds of rubble on one side of it are covered with\r\ngrass and planted with mazzard trees, grown to quite a large girth. On\r\nthe other side one is confronted by a tall sheet of black, carboniferous\r\nrock, rising sheer out of the inky water--a bare sombre surface on which\r\nno mosses even--\"tender creatures of pity,\" Ruskin calls them--have\r\ntaken compassion by softening the jagged edges of the strata or nestling\r\nin the scars. It is an excellent example of \"Contortion\" as Geologists\r\nsay, for the beds are bent into a quite regular geometrical pattern\r\n--syncline and anticline in waves--by deep-seated plutonic force that\r\nmakes the mind quake in the effort to imagine it.\r\n\r\nOn the top of this rock and overhanging the water--a gaunt,\r\nhaggard-looking Fir tree impends, as it seems in a perilous balance,\r\nwhile down below, the pool, sleek and shiny, quietly waits with a\r\ncatlike patience.\r\n\r\nIn summer time, successive rows of Foxgloves one behind the other in\r\nbarbaric splendour are ranged around the grassy rubble slopes like\r\nspectators in an amphitheatre awaiting the spectacle. Fire-bellied Efts\r\nslip here and there lazily thro' the water. Occasionally a Grass-snake\r\nwould swim across the pool and once I caught one and on opening his\r\nstomach found a large fire-bellied Eft inside. The sun beats fiercely\r\ninto this deep hollow and makes the water tepid. On the surface grows a\r\nglairy Alga, which was once all green but now festers in yellow patches\r\nand causes a horrible stench. Everything is absolutely still, air and\r\nwater are stagnant. A large _Dytiscus_ beetle rises to the surface to\r\nbreathe and every now and then large bubbles of marsh gas come sailing\r\nmajestically up from the depth and explode quietly into the fetid air.\r\nThe _horrificness_ of this place impressed me even when I was intent\r\nonly on fishing there for bugs and efts. Now, seen in retrospect, it\r\nhaunts me.\r\n\r\n_May_ 28.\r\n\r\nIt is only by accident that certain of our bodily functions are\r\ndistasteful. Many birds eat the faeces of their young. The vomits of\r\nsome Owls are formed into shapely pellets, often of beautiful\r\nappearance, when composed of the glittering multi-coloured elytra of\r\nBeetles, etc. The common Eland is known to micturate on the tuft of hair\r\non the crown of its head, and it does this habitually, when lying down,\r\nby bending its head around and down--apparently because of the aroma,\r\nperhaps of sexual importance during mating time, as it is a habit of the\r\nmale alone.\r\n\r\nAt lunch time, had an unpleasant intermittency period in my heart's\r\naction and this rather eclipsed my anxiety over a probable Zeppelin\r\nRaid. Went home to my rooms by 'bus, and before setting off to catch my\r\ntrain for West Wycombe to stay for the week-end at a Farm with\r\nE---- swallowed two teaspoonfuls of neat brandy, filled my flask, and\r\ntook a taxi to Paddington. At 3.50 started to walk to C---- H---- Farm\r\nfrom W. Wycombe Station, where E---- has been lodging for some weeks\r\ntaking a rest cure after a serious nervous breakdown thro' overwork. As\r\nsoon as I stepped out of the train, I sniffed the fresh air and soon\r\nmade off down the road, happy to have left London and the winter and the\r\nwar far behind. The first man of whom I inquired the way happened to\r\nhave been working at the Farm only a few weeks ago, so I relied\r\nimplicitly on his directions, and as it was but a mile and a half\r\ndecided that my wobbly heart could stand the strain. I set out with a\r\ngood deal of pleasurable anticipation. I was genuinely looking forward\r\nto seeing E----, altho' in the past few weeks our relations had become a\r\nlittle strained, at least on my part, mainly because of her little\r\nscrappy notes to me scribbled in pencil, undated, and dull! Yet I could\r\ndo with a volume of \"Sonnets from the Portuguese.\" These letters chilled\r\nme. In reply, I wrote with cold steel short, lifeless formal notes, for\r\nI felt genuinely aggrieved that she should care so little how she wrote\r\nto me or how she expressed her love. I became ironical with myself over\r\nthe prospect of marrying a girl who appeared so little to appreciate my\r\neducation and mental habits. [What a popinjay!--1917.] My petty spirit\r\ngrew disenchanted, out of love. I was false to her in a hundred\r\ninconsiderable little ways and even deliberately planned the breaking\r\noff of the engagement some months hence when she should be restored to\r\nnormal health.\r\n\r\nBut once in the country and, as I thought, nearing my love at every step\r\nand at every bend in the road, even anticipating her arms around me with\r\nreal pleasure (for she promised to meet me half way), I on a sudden grew\r\neager for her again and was assured of a happy week-end with her. Then\r\nthe road grew puzzling and I became confused, uncertain of the way. I\r\nbegan to murmur she should have given me instructions. Every now and\r\nthen I had to stop and rest as my heart was beating so furiously.\r\nEspying a farm on the left I made sure I had arrived at my destination\r\nand walked across a field to it and entered the yard where I heard some\r\none milking a cow in a shed. I shouted over the five-barred gate into\r\nempty space, \"Is this C---- H---- Farm?\" A labourer came out of the shed\r\nand redirected me. It was now ten to five. I was tired and out of sorts,\r\nand carried a troublesome little handbag. I swore and cursed and found\r\nfault with E---- and the Universe.\r\n\r\nI trudged on, asking people, as I went, the way, finally emerging from\r\nthe cover of a beautiful wood thro' a wicket gate almost at the entrance\r\nto the Farm I sought. At the front door we embraced affectionately and\r\nwe entered at once, I putting a quite good face upon my afternoon's\r\nexertions--when I consider my unbridled fury of a short time before.\r\nE----, as brown as a berry, conducted me to my bedroom and I nearly\r\nforgot to take this obvious opportunity of kissing her again.\r\n\r\n\"How are you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" she said, fencing.\r\n\r\n\"But really?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\n(A little nettled): \"My dear, that isn't going to satisfy me. You will\r\nhave to tell me exactly how you are.\"\r\n\r\nAfter tea, I recovered myself and we went for a walk together. The\r\nbeauty of the country warmed me up, and in the wood we kissed--I for my\r\npart happy and quite content with the present state of our relations,\r\n_i.e._, affectionate but not perfervid.\r\n\r\n_May_ 29.\r\n\r\nGot up early and walked around the Farm before breakfast. Everything\r\npromises to be delightful--young calves, broods of ducklings, and\r\nturkeys, fowls, cats and dogs. In the yard are two large Cathedral\r\nbarns, with enormous pent roofs sloping down to within about two feet of\r\nthe ground and entered by way of great double doors that open with the\r\nslowness and solemnity of a Castle's portal studded with iron knobs. It\r\nthrilled me to the marrow on first putting my head outside to be greeted\r\nwith the grunt of an invisible pig that I found scraping his back on the\r\nother side of the garden wall.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, E---- and I sat together in the Beech Wood: E---- on a\r\ndeck chair and I on a rug on the ground. In spite of our beautiful\r\nsurroundings we did not progress very well, but I attributed her slight\r\naloofness to the state of her nerves. She is still far from recovered.\r\nThese wonderful Beech Woods are quite new to me. The forest beech is a\r\nvery different plant from the solitary tree. In the struggle to reach\r\nthe light the Forest Beech grows lean and tall and gives an\r\nextraordinary suggestion of wiry powerful strength. On the margins of\r\nthe wood, Bluebells were mobilised in serried ranks. Great Tits\r\nwhistled--in the language of our allies--\"Bijou, Bijou\" and I agreed\r\nwith every one of them.\r\n\r\nSome folk don't like to walk over Bluebells or Buttercups or other\r\nflowers growing on the ground. But it is foolish to try to pamper Nature\r\nas if she were a sickly child. She is strong and can stand it. You can\r\nstamp on and crush a thousand flowers--they will all come up again next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nBy some labyrinthine way which I cannot now recall, the conversation\r\nworked round to a leading question by E.--if in times like these we\r\nought not to cease being in love? She was quite calm and serious. I said\r\n\"No, of course not, silly.\" My immediate apprehension was that she had\r\nperceived the coldness in my letters and I was quite satisfied that she\r\nwas so well able to read the signs in the sky. \"But you don't wish to go\r\non?\" she persisted. I persisted that I did, that I had no misgivings, no\r\nsecond thoughts, that I was not merely taking pity on her, etc. The wild\r\ntemptation to seize this opportunity for a break I smothered in\r\nreflecting how ill she was and how necessary to wait first till she was\r\nwell again. These thoughts passed swiftly, vaguely like wraiths thro' my\r\nmind: I was barely conscious of them. Then I recalled the sonnet about\r\ncoming in the rearward of a conquered woe and mused thereon. But I took\r\nno action. [Fortunately--for me. 1916.]\r\n\r\nPresently with cunning I said that there was no cloud on my horizon\r\nwhatever--only her \"letters disappointed me a little--they were so\r\ncold,\" but \"as soon as I saw you again, darling, those feelings\r\ndisappeared.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were spoken I knew they were not as they might seem, the\r\nwords of a liar and hypocrite. They _became_ true. E---- looked very\r\nsweet and helpless and I loved her again as much as ever.\r\n\r\n\"It's funny,\" she said, \"but I thought your letters were cold. Letters\r\nare so horrid.\"\r\n\r\nThe incident shews how impossible is intellectual honesty between\r\nlovers. Truth is at times a hound which must to kennel.\r\n\r\n\"Write as you would speak,\" said I. \"You know I'm not one to carp about\r\na spelling mistake!\"\r\n\r\nThe latter remark astonished me. Was it indeed I who was speaking? All\r\nthe week I had been fuming over this. Yet I was honest: the Sun and E.'s\r\npresence were dispelling my ill-humours and crochets. We sealed our\r\nconversation with a kiss and swore never to doubt each other again. E.'s\r\nspell was beginning to act. It is always the same. I cannot resist the\r\nactual presence of this woman. Out of her sight, I can in cold blood\r\nplan a brutal rupture. I can pay her a visit when the first kiss is a\r\nduty and the embrace a formality. But after 5 minutes I am as passionate\r\nand devoted as before. It is always thus. After leaving her, I am angry\r\nto think that once more I have succumbed.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we went out into a field and sat together in the grass.\r\nIt is beautiful. We lay flat on our backs and gazed up at the sky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nS.H. has died of enteric at Malta. In writing to Mrs. H., instead of\r\ndwelling on what a splendid fellow he was I belaboured the fact that I\r\nstill remembered our boyish friendship in every detail and still kept\r\nhis photo on my mantelpiece and altho' \"in later years\" I didn't suppose\r\nwe \"had a great deal in common I discovered that a friendship even\r\nbetween two small boys cannot wholly disappear into the void.\"\r\nDiscussing myself when I ought to have been praising him! Ugh! She will\r\nthink what a conceited, puff-breasted Jackanapes. These phrases have\r\nrankled in my mind ever since I dropped the letter into the letter-box.\r\n\"Your Stanley, Mrs. H., was of course a very inferior sort of person and\r\nnaturally, you could hardly expect me to remain friendly with him but\r\nrest assured I hadn't forgotten him,\" etc.\r\n\r\n_The Luxury of Lunacy_\r\n\r\nYesterday, I read a paper at the Zoological Society about lice. There\r\nwas a goodly baldness of sconce and some considerable length of beard\r\npresent that listened or appeared to listen to my innocent remarks with\r\ngreat solemnity and sapience.... I badly wanted to tell them some horrid\r\nstories about human lice but I had not the courage. I wanted to jolt\r\nthese middle-aged gentlemen by performing a few tricks but I am too\r\ntimid for such adventures. But before going to sleep I imagined a\r\npandemonium in which with a perfectly glacial manner I produced lice\r\nalive from my pockets, conjured them down from the roof in a rain, with\r\nthe skilful sleight of hand drew them out of the chairman's beard, made\r\nthe ladies scream as I approached, dared to say they were all lousy and\r\nunclean and finished up with an eloquent apostrophe after the manner of\r\nThomas de Quincey (and of Sir Walter Raleigh before him) beginning:\r\n\r\n\"O just, subtle and eloquent avenger, pierce the hides of these\r\nabominable old fogies, speckle their polished calvaria with the scarlet\r\nblood drops....\"\r\n\r\nBut I hadn't the courage. Shelley in a crowded omnibus suddenly burst\r\nout: \"O let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the deaths of\r\nKings, etc.\" I've always wanted to do something like that and when I\r\nhave £5 to spare I hope to pull the communication cord of an express\r\ntrain--my hands tingle as often as I look at it. Dr. Johnson's courage\r\nin tapping the lamp-posts is really everyone's envy tho' we laugh at him\r\nfor it and say, green-eyed, that he was mad. In walking along the\r\npavement, I sometimes indulge myself in the unutterable, deeply rooted\r\nsatisfaction of stepping on a separate flagstone where this is possible\r\nwith every stride. And if this is impossible or not easy, there arises\r\nin me a vague mental uneasiness, some subconscious suspicion that the\r\nworld is not properly geometrical and that the whole universe perhaps is\r\nworking out of truth. I am also rather proud of my courageous\r\nself-surrender to the daemon of laughter, especially in those early days\r\nwhen H. and I used to sit opposite one another and howl like hyenas.\r\nAfter the most cacophonous cachinnations as soon as we had recovered\r\nourselves he or I would regularly remark in serious and confidential\r\ntones, \"I say--we _really_ are going mad.\" But what a delightful luxury\r\nto be thus mad amid the great, spacious, architectural solemnity with\r\ngargoyles and effigies of a scientific meeting! Some people never do\r\nmore than chuckle or smile--and they are often very humorous happy\r\npeople, ignorant nevertheless of the joy of riding themselves on the\r\nsnaffle and losing all control.\r\n\r\nWhile boating on ---- last summer, we saw two persons, a man and a girl\r\nsitting together on the beach reading a book with heads almost touching.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what they're reading?\" I said, and I was dying to know. We\r\nmade a few facetious guesses.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do,\" said Mrs. ----.\r\n\r\nThe truth is we all wanted to know. We were suddenly mad with curiosity\r\nas we watched the happy pair turning over leaf after leaf.\r\n\r\nWhile R---- leaned on his oars, I stood up in the boat and threatened to\r\nshout out a polite enquiry--just to prove that the will is free. But\r\nseeing my intention the boat-load grew nervous and said seriously, \"No,\"\r\nwhich unnerved me at the last moment so I sat down again. Why was I so\r\nafraid of being thought a lunatic by two persons in the distance whom I\r\nhad never seen and probably would never see again? Besides I _was_ a\r\nlunatic--we all were.\r\n\r\nIn our post-prandial perambulations about S. Kensington G---- and I\r\noften pass the window of a photographer's shop containing always a\r\nprofusion of bare arms, chests, necks, bosoms belonging to actresses,\r\naristocrats and harlots--some very beautiful indeed. Yet on the whole\r\nthe window annoys us, especially one picture of a young thing with an\r\narum lily (ghastly plant!) laid exquisitely across her breast.\r\n\r\n\"Why do we suffer this?\" I asked G----, tapping the window ledge as we\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he answered lamely--morose. (Pause while the two\r\nembittered young men continue to look in and the beautiful young women\r\ncontinue to look out.)\r\n\r\nThoroughly disgruntled I said at last: \"If only we had the courage of\r\nour innate madness, the courage of children, lunatics and men of genius,\r\nwe should get some stamp paper, and stick a square beneath each\r\nphotograph with our comments.\"\r\n\r\nBaudelaire describes how he dismissed a glass vendor because he had no\r\ncoloured glasses--\"glasses of rose and crimson, magical glasses, glasses\r\nof Paradise\"--and, stepping out on to his balcony, threw a flowerpot\r\ndown on the tray of glasses as soon as the man issued into the street\r\nbelow, shouting down furiously, \"The Life Beautiful! The Life\r\nBeautiful.\"\r\n\r\nBergson's theory is that laughter is a \"social gesture\" so that when a\r\nman in a top hat treads on a banana skin and slips down we laugh at him\r\nfor his lack \"of living pliableness.\" At this rate we ought to be\r\nprofoundly solemn at Baudelaire's action and moreover a \"social gesture\"\r\nis more likely to be an expression of society's will to conformity in\r\nall its members rather than any dangerous \"living pliableness.\" Society\r\nhates living pliableness and prefers drill, routine, orthodoxy,\r\nconformity. It hated the living pliableness of Turner, of Keats, of\r\nSamuel Butler and a hundred others.\r\n\r\nBut to return to lunacy: the truth is we are all mad fundamentally and\r\nare merely schooled into sanity by education. Pascal wrote: \"Men are so\r\nnecessarily mad that not to be mad would amount to another form of\r\nmadness.\" And, in fact, the man who has succeeded in extirpating this\r\nintoxication of life is usually said to be \"temporarily insane.\" In\r\nthose melancholy interludes of sanity when the mind becomes rationalised\r\nwe all know how much we have been deceived and gulled, what an\r\nextraordinary spectacle humanity presents rushing on in noise and tumult\r\nno one knows why or whither. Look at that tailor in his shop--why does\r\nhe do it? Some day in the future he thinks he will.... But the day\r\nnever comes and he is nevertheless content.\r\n\r\n_May_ 30.\r\n\r\nA brilliantly sunny day. This funny old farm-house where we are staying\r\nquite delights me. It is pleasant, too, to dawdle over dressing, to put\r\naway shaving tackle for a day or so, to jump out of bed in the morning\r\nand thrust my head out of the window into the fresh and stock-scented\r\nair of the garden, listen to the bird chorus or watch a \"scrap\" in the\r\npoultry-run. Then all unashamed, I dress myself before a dear old lady\r\nin a flowery print gown concealing 4 thin legs and over the top of the\r\nmirror a piece of lace just like a bonnet, caught up in front by a\r\npiece of pink ribbon. On the walls Pear's Soap Annuals, on a side table\r\n_Swiss Family Robinson_ and _Children of the New Forest_. Then there are\r\nrats under the floors, two wooden staircases which wind up out of sight,\r\ntwo white dairies, iron hapses on all the doors and a privy at the top\r\nof the orchard. (Tell me--how do you explain the psychosis of a being\r\nwho on a day must have seized hammer and nail and an almanac picture of\r\na woman in the snow with a basket of goodies--\"An Errand of\r\nMercy\"--carried all three to the top of the orchard and nailed the\r\npicture up on the dirty wall in the semi-darkness of an earth-closet?)\r\n\r\nGot up quite early before breakfast and went birds'-nesting.... It would\r\ntake too long and be too sentimental for me to record my feelings on\r\nlooking into the first nest I found--a Chaffinch's, the first wild\r\nbird's eggs I have seen for many years. As I stood with an egg between\r\nthumb and forefinger, my memories flocked down like white birds and\r\nsurrounded me. I remained still, fed them with my thoughts and let them\r\nperch upon my person--a second St. Francis of Assisi. Then I shoo'ed\r\nthem all away and prepared for the more palpitating enjoyment of to-day.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we sat in the Buttercup field--my love and I--and\r\n\"plucked up kisses by the roots that grew upon our lips.\" The sun was\r\nstreaming down and the field thickly peopled with Buttercups. From where\r\nwe sat we could see the whole of the valley below and Farmer Whaley--a\r\nspeck in the distance--working a machine in a field. We watched him\r\nidly. The gamekeeper's gun went off in one of the covers. It was jolly\r\nto put our heads together right down deep in the Buttercups and\r\nluxuriously follow the pelting activities of the tiny insects crawling\r\nhere and there in the forest of grass, clambering over a broken blade\r\nathwart another like a wrecked tree or busily enquiring into some low\r\nscrub at the roots. A chicken came our way and he seemed an enormous\r\nbird from the grass-blade's point of view. How nice to be a chicken in\r\na field of Buttercups and see them as big as Sunflowers! or to be a\r\nGulliver in the Beech Woods! to be so small as to be able to climb a\r\nButtercup, tumble into the corolla and be dusted yellow or to be so big\r\nas to be able to pull up a Beech-tree with finger and thumb! If only a\r\nman were a magician, could play fast and loose with rigid Nature? what a\r\nmultitude of rich experiences he could discover for himself!\r\n\r\nI looked long and steadily this morning at the magnificent torso of a\r\nhigh forest Beech and tried to project myself into its lithe tiger-like\r\nform, to feel its electric sap vitalising all my frame out to the tip of\r\nevery tingling leaf, to possess its splendid erectness in my own bones.\r\nI could have flung my arms around its fascinating body but the austerity\r\nof the great creature forbad it. Then a Hawk fired my ambition!--to be a\r\nHawk, or a Falcon, to have a Falcon's soul, a Falcon's heart--that\r\nsplendid muscle in the cage of the thorax--and the Falcon's pride and\r\nsagacious eye![3]\r\n\r\nWhen the sun grew too hot we went into the wood where waves of Bluebells\r\ndashed up around the foot of the Oak in front of us.... I never knew\r\nbefore, the delight of offering oneself up--an oblation of one's whole\r\nbeing; I even longed for some self-sacrifice, to have to give up\r\nsomething for her sake. It intoxicated me to think I was making another\r\nhappy....\r\n\r\nAfter a lunch of scrambled eggs and rhubarb and cream went up into the\r\nBeech Wood again and sat on a rug at the foot of a tree. The sun\r\nfiltered in thro' the greenery casting a \"dim, religious light.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like a cathedral,\" I chattered away, \"stained glass windows,\r\npillars, aisles--all complete.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be nice to be married in a Cathedral like this,\" she said.\r\n\"At C---- Hall Cathedral, by the Rev. Canon _Beech_....\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Henry Wood was the organist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"and the Rev. Blackbird the precentor.\"\r\n\r\nWe laughed over our silliness!\r\n\r\nShrew-mice pattered over the dead leaves and one came boldly into view\r\nunder a bramble bush--she had never seen one before. Overhead, a ribald\r\nfellow of a Blackbird whistled a jaunty tune. E---- laughed. \"I am sure\r\nthat Blackbird is laughing at us,\" she said. \"It makes me feel quite\r\nhot.\"\r\n\r\nThis evening we sat on the slope of a big field where by lowering our\r\neyes we could see the sun setting behind the grass blades--a very pretty\r\nsight which I do not remember ever to have noted before. A large blue\r\n_Carabus_ beetle was stumbling about, Culvers cooed in the woods near\r\nby. It was delightful to be up 600 feet on a grassy field under the\r\nshadow of a large wood at sunset with my darling.\r\n\r\n_May_ 31.\r\n\r\nSitting at tea in the farm house to-day E---- cried suddenly, pointing\r\nto a sandy cat in the garden:\r\n\r\n\"There,--he's the father of the little kittens in the barn and I'll tell\r\nyou how we know. P---- noticed the kittens had big feet and later on saw\r\nthat old Tom stalking across the garden with big feet of exactly the\r\nsame kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you impute the paternity of the kittens to the gentleman under the\r\nlaurel bushes?\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the kittens to-night and found they had extra toes. \"Mr.\r\nSixtoes,\" as W---- calls him also possesses six toes, so the\r\ncircumstantial evidence looks black against him.\r\n\r\n_June_ 1.\r\n\r\nIn the Beech Wood all the morning. Heigh-ho! it's grand to lie out as\r\nstraight as a line on your back, gaze upwards into the tree above, and\r\nwith a caressing eye follow its branches out into their multitudinous\r\nramifications forward and back--luxurious travel for the tired eye. ...\r\nThen I would shut my eyes and try to guess where her next kiss would\r\ndescend. Then I opened my eyes and watched her face in the most\r\nextravagant detail, I counted the little filaments on her precious mole\r\nand saw the sun thro' the golden down of her throat....\r\n\r\nSunlight and a fresh wind. A day of tiny cameos, little _coups\r\nd'œil_, fleeting impressions snapshotted on the mind: the glint on\r\nthe keeper's gun as he crossed a field a mile away below us, sunlight\r\nall along a silken hawser which some Spider engineer had spun between\r\nthe tops of two tall trees spanning the whole width of a bridle path,\r\nthe constant patter of Shrew-mice over dead leaves, the pendulum of a\r\nBumble-bee in a flower, and the just perceptible oscillation of the tree\r\ntops in the wind. While we are at meals the perfume of Lilac and Stocks\r\npours in thro' the window and when we go to bed it is still pouring in\r\nby the open lattice.\r\n\r\n_June_ 2.\r\n\r\nEach day I drop a specially selected Buttercup in past the little\r\n\"Peeler,\" at the apex of the \"V\" to lie among the blue ribbons of her\r\ncamisoles--those dainty white leaves that wrap around her bosom like the\r\npetals around the heart of a Rose. Then at night when she undresses, it\r\nfalls out and she preserves it.\r\n\r\nIn the woods, hearing an extra loud patter on the leaves, we turned our\r\nheads and saw a Frog hopping our way. I caught him and gave an\r\nelementary lesson in Anatomy. I described to her the brain, the pineal\r\norgan in Anguis, Sphenodon's pineal eye, etc. Then we fell to kissing\r\nagain.... Every now and then she raises her head and listens (like a\r\nThrush on the lawn) thinking she hears someone approach. We neither of\r\nus speak much ... and at the end of the day, the nerve endings on my\r\nlips are tingling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFarmer Whaley is a funny old man with a soft pious voice. When he feeds\r\nthe Fowls, he sucks in a gentle, caressing noise between his lips for\r\nall the world as if he fed them because he loved them, and not because\r\nhe wants to fatten them up for killing. His daughter Lucy, aged 22,\r\nloves all the animals of the farm and they all love her; the Cows stand\r\nmonumentally still while she strokes them down the blaze or\r\naffectionately waggles their dewlaps. This morning, she walked up to a\r\nlittle Calf in the farm-yard scarce a fortnight old which started to\r\n\"back\" in a funny way, spraddling out its legs and lowering its head.\r\nMiss Lucy laughed merrily and cried \"Ah! you funny little thing,\" and\r\nwent off on her way to feed the Fowls who all raced to the gate as soon\r\nas they heard her footsteps. She brought in two double-yolked Ducks'\r\neggs for us to see and marvel at. In the breakfast room stands a stuffed\r\nCollie dog in a glass case. I'd as soon embalm my grandmother and keep\r\nher on the sideboard.\r\n\r\nI asked young George, the farm-boy, what bird went like this: I whistled\r\nit. He looked abashed and said a Chaffinch. I told Miss Lucy who said\r\nGeorge was a silly boy, and Miss Lucy told Farmer Whaley who said George\r\nought to know better--it was a Mistle-Thrush.\r\n\r\nThe letters are brought us each morning by a tramp with a game leg who\r\nsecretes his Majesty's Mails in a shabby bowler hat, the small packages\r\nand parcels going to the roomy tail pocket of a dirty morning coat. A\r\ndecayed gentleman of much interest to us.\r\n\r\n_June_ 3.\r\n\r\nWe have made a little nest in the wood and I lead her into it by the\r\nhand over the briars and undergrowth as if conducting her to the grand\r\npiano on a concert platform. I kissed her....\r\n\r\nThen in a second we switch back to ordinary conversation. In an ordinary\r\nconversational voice I ask the trees, the birds, the sky.\r\n\r\n\"What's become of all the gold?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's become of Waring?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is Love? 'Tis not hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the snows of yesteryear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who killed Cock Robin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's who?\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on thro' all the great interrogatives that I could think of till\r\nshe stopped my mouth with a kiss and we both laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Penderkins,\" I say. \"Miss Penderlet, Miss Pender-au-lait, Miss\r\nPender-filings.\"\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean? she cries. \"What's the point of the names? Why take my\r\nname in vain? Why? What? How?\"\r\n\r\nShe does not know that clever young men sometimes trade on their\r\nreputation among simpler folk by pretending that meaningless remarks\r\nconceal some subtlety or cynicism, some little Attic snap.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have been teaching her to distinguish the songs of different birds and\r\noften we sit a long while in the Cathedral Wood while I say, \"What's\r\nthat?\" and \"What's that?\" and she tells me. It is delightful to watch\r\nher dear serious face as she listens.... This evening I gave a _viva\r\nvoce_ examination as per below:\r\n\r\n\"What does the Yellow Hammer say?\"\r\n\r\n\"What colour are the Hedge Sparrow's eggs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Describe the Nightjar's voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many eggs does it lay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you never told me about the Nightjar,\" she cried outraged.\r\n\r\n\"No: it's a difficult question put in for candidates taking honours.\"\r\n\r\nThen we rambled on into Tomfoolery. \"Describe the call-note of a motor\r\nomnibus.\" \"Why does the chicken cross the road?\" and \"What's\r\nthat?\"--when a railway engine whistled in the distance.\r\n\r\nMeasure by this our happiness!\r\n\r\n_June_ 4.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past eight, this morning, the horse and trap were awaiting\r\nme outside, and bidding her \"Goodbye\" I got in and drove off--she riding\r\non the step down so far, as the gate. Then we waved till we were out of\r\nsight. Back in London by 10 a.m. She makes slow progress, poor dear--her\r\nnerves are still very much of a jangle. But I am better, my heart is\r\nless wobbly.\r\n\r\n_June_ 5.\r\n\r\nR---- cannot make me out. He says one day I complain bitterly at not\r\nreceiving a Portuguese sonnet once a week, and the next all is well and\r\nLove reigneth. \"Verily a Sphinx.\"\r\n\r\n_June_ 7.\r\n\r\nSpent the afternoon at the Royal Army Medical College in consultation\r\nwith the Professor of Hygiene. Amid all the paraphernalia of research,\r\neven when discussing a serious problem with a serious Major, I could not\r\ntake myself seriously. I am incurably trivial and always feel myself an\r\nirresponsible youth, wondering and futile, among owlish grown-ups.\r\n\r\nAt 4 p.m. departed and went down on Vauxhall Bridge and watched a\r\nflour-barge being unloaded before returning to the Museum. I could\r\nreadily hang on behind a cart, stare at an accident, pull a face at a\r\npoliceman and then run away.\r\n\r\n_June_ 20.\r\n\r\n... It annoys me to find the _laissez-faire_ attitude of our relatives.\r\nNot one with a remonstrance for us and yet all the omens are against our\r\nmarriage. In the state of my nervous system and in the state of hers--we\r\nhave both had serious nervous break-downs--how impossible it seems! Yet\r\nthey say all the old conventional things to us, about our happiness and\r\nso on!...\r\n\r\n... Am I a moral monster? Surely a man who can combine such calculating\r\ncallousness with really generous impulses of the heart is--what?\r\n\r\nThe truth is I think I am in love with her: but I am also mightily in\r\nlove with myself. One or the other has to give.\r\n\r\n_June_ 25.\r\n\r\nIf sometimes you saw me in my room by myself, you would say I was a\r\nridiculous coxcomb. For I walk about, look out of the window then at the\r\nmirror--turning my head sideways perhaps so as to see it in profile. Or\r\nI gaze down into my eyes--my eyes always impress me--and wonder what\r\neffect I produce on others. This, I believe, is not so much vanity as\r\ncuriosity. I know I am not prepossessing in appearance--my nose is\r\ncrooked and my skin is blotched. Yet my physique--because it is\r\nmine--interests me. I like to see myself walking and talking. I should\r\nlike to hold myself in my hand in front of me like a Punchinello and\r\ncarefully examine myself at my leisure.\r\n\r\n_June_ 28.\r\n\r\nSaw my brother A---- off at Waterloo en route for Armageddon. Darling\r\nfellow. He shook hands with P---- and H----, and P---- wished him\r\n\"Goodbye, and good luck.\" Then he held my hand a moment, said \"Goodbye,\r\nold man,\" and for a second gave me a queer little nervous look. I could\r\nonly say \"Goodbye,\" but we understand each other perfectly.... It is\r\nhorrible. I love him tenderly.\r\n\r\n_June_ 29.\r\n\r\n_Sleep_\r\n\r\nSleep means unconsciousness: unconsciousness is a solemn state--you get\r\nit for example from a blow on the head with a mallet. It always\r\nweightily impresses me to see someone asleep--especially someone I love\r\nas to-day, stretched out as still as a log--who perhaps a few minutes\r\nago was alive, even animated. And there is nothing so welcome, unless it\r\nbe the sunrise, as the first faint gleam of recognition in the\r\nhalf-opened eye when consciousness like a mighty river begins to flow in\r\nand restore our love to us again.\r\n\r\nWhen I go to bed myself, I sometimes jealously guard my faculties from\r\nbeing filched away by sleep. I almost fear sleep: it makes me\r\napprehensive--this wonderful and unknowable Thing which is going to\r\nhappen to me for which I must lay myself out on a bed and wait, with an\r\nelaborate preparedness. Unlike Sir Thomas Browne, I am not always so\r\ncontent to take my leave of the sun and sleep, if need be, into the\r\nresurrection. And I sometimes lie awake and wonder when the mysterious\r\nVisitor will come to me and call me away from this thrilling world, and\r\nhow He does it, to which end I try to remain conscious of the gradual\r\nprocess and to understand it: an impossibility of course involving a\r\ncontradiction in terms. So I shall never know, nor will anybody else.\r\n\r\n_July_ 2.\r\n\r\nI've had such a successful evening--you've no idea! The pen simply flew\r\nalong, automatically easy, page after page in perfect sequence. My style\r\ntrilled and bickered and rolled and ululated in an infinite variety; you\r\nwill find in it all the subtlest modulations, inflections and suavities.\r\nMy afflatus came down from Heaven in a bar of light like the\r\nShekinah--straight from God, very God of very God. I worked in a golden\r\nhalo of light and electric sparks came off my pen nib as I scratched the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n_July_ 3.\r\n\r\n_The Clever Young Man_\r\n\r\nArgued with R---- this morning. He is a type specimen of the clever\r\nyoung man. We both are. Our flowers of speech are often forced hot-house\r\nplants, paradoxes and cynicisms fly as thick as driving rain and Shaw is\r\nour great exemplar. I could write out an exhaustive analysis of the\r\nclever young man, and being one myself can speak from \"inspired sources\"\r\nas the newspapers say.\r\n\r\nA common habit is to underline and memorise short, sharp, witty remarks\r\nhe sees in books and then on future occasions dish them up for his own\r\nself-glorification. If the author be famous he begins, \"As ---- says,\r\netc.\" If unknown the quotation is quietly purloined. He is always very\r\nself-conscious and at the same time very self-possessed and very\r\nconceited. You tell me with tonic candour that I am insufferably\r\nconceited. In return, I smile, making a sardonic avowal of my good\r\nopinion of myself, my theory being that as conceit is, as a rule,\r\nimplicit and, as a rule, blushingly denied, you will mistake my impudent\r\nconfession for bluff and conclude there is really something far more\r\nsubstantial and honest beneath my apparent conceit. If, on the other\r\nhand, I am conceited, why I have admitted it--I agree with you--but tho'\r\nthere is no virtue in the confession being quite detached and\r\nunashamed--still you haven't caught me by the tail. It is very difficult\r\nto circumvent a clever young man. He is as agile as a monkey.\r\n\r\nHis principal concern of course is to arouse and maintain a reputation\r\nfor profundity and wit. This is done by the simple mechanical formula of\r\nantithesis: if you like winkles he proves that cockles are inveterately\r\nbetter; if you admire Ruskin he tears him to ribbons. If you want to\r\nlearn to swim--as it is safer, he shows it is more dangerous to know how\r\nto swim and so on. I know his whole box of tricks. I myself am now\r\nplaying the clever young man by writing out this analysis just as if I\r\nwere not one myself.\r\n\r\nYou doubt my cleverness? Well, some years ago in R----'s presence I\r\ncalled ----\"the Rev. Fastidious Brisk,\"--the nickname be it recalled\r\nwhich Henley gave to Stevenson (without the addition of \"Rev.\"). At the\r\ntime I had no intention of appropriating the witticism as I quite\r\nimagined R---- was acquainted with it. His unexpected explosion of\r\nmirth, however, made me uncomfortably uncertain of this, yet for the\r\nlife of me I couldn't muster the honesty to assure him that my feather\r\nwas a borrowed one. A few weeks later he referred to it again as\r\n\"certainly one of my better ones\"--but still I remained dumb and the\r\ntime for explanations went for once and all. Now see what a pretty\r\npickle I am in: the name \"Brisk\" or \"F.B.\" is in constant use by us for\r\nthis particular person--he goes by no other name, meanwhile I sit and\r\nwonder how long it will be before R---- finds me out. There are all\r\nsorts of ways in which he might find out: he might read about it for\r\nhimself, someone might tell him or--worst of all--one day when we are\r\ndining out somewhere he will announce to the whole company my brilliant\r\nappellation as a little after-dinner diversion: I shall at once observe\r\nthat the person opposite me _knows_ and is about to air his knowledge;\r\nthen I shall look sternly at him and try to hold him: he will hesitate\r\nand I shall land him with a left and right: \"I suppose you've read\r\nHenley's verses on Stevenson?\" I remark easily and in a moment or so\r\nlater the conversation has moved on.\r\n\r\n_August_ 1.\r\n\r\nAm getting married at ---- Register Office on September 15th. It is\r\nimpossible to set down here all the labyrinthine ambages of my will and\r\nfeelings in regard to this event. Such incredible vacillations, doubts,\r\nfears. I have been living at a great rate below surface recently. \"If\r\nyou enjoy only twelve months' happiness,\" the Doctor said to me, \"it is\r\nworth while.\" But he makes a recommendation.... At his suggestion E----\r\nwent to see him and from his own mouth learnt all the truth about the\r\nstate of my health, to prevent possible mutual recriminations in the\r\nfuture.[4] To marry an introspective dyspeptic--what a prospect for\r\nher!... I exercise my microscopic analysis on her now as well as on\r\nmyself.... This power in me is growing daily more automatic and more\r\nrepugnant. It is a nasty morbid unhealthy growth that I want to hide if\r\nI cannot destroy. It amounts to being able at will to switch myself in\r\nand out of all my most cherished emotions; it is like the case in Sir\r\nMichael Foster's _Physiology_ of a man who, by pressing a tumour in his\r\nneck could stop or at any rate control the action of his heart.\r\n\r\n_August_ 2.\r\n\r\nHouse pride in newly-wed folk, for example, H. and D. to-day at Golder's\r\nGreen or the Teignmouth folk, is very trying to the bachelor visitor.\r\nThey will carry a chair across the room as tenderly as tho' it were a\r\nchild and until its safe transit is assured, all conversation goes by\r\nthe board. Or the wife suddenly makes a remark to the husband _sotto\r\nvoce_, both thereupon start up simultaneously (leaving the fate of\r\nWarsaw undecided) while you, silenced by this unexpected manœuvre, wilt\r\naway in your chair, the pregnant phrase still-born on your lips.\r\nPresently they re-enter the room with the kitten that was heard in the\r\nscullery or with a big stick used to flourish at a little Tomtit on the\r\nrose tree. _She_ apologises and both settle down again, recompose their\r\ncountenances into a listening aspect and with a devastating politeness,\r\npick up the poor, little, frayed-out thread of the conversation where it\r\nleft off with: \"Europe? you were saying....\" I mobilise my scattered\r\nunits of ideas but it is all a little chilly for the lady of the house\r\nif she listens with her face and speaks with her lips--her heart is far\r\nfrom me: she fixes a glassy eye on the tip of my cigarette, waiting to\r\nsee if the ash will fall on her carpet.\r\n\r\n_August_ 6.\r\n\r\nThe most intimate and extensive journal can only give each day a\r\nrelatively small sifting of the almost infinite number of things that\r\nflow thro' the consciousness. However vigilant and artful a diarist may\r\nbe, plenty of things escape him and in any event re-collection is not\r\nre-creation....\r\n\r\nTo keep a journal is to have a secret liaison of a very sentimental\r\nkind. A _journal intime_ is a super-confidante to whom everything is\r\ntold and confessed. For an engaged or married man to have a secret\r\nsuper-confidante who knows things which are concealed from his lady\r\nseems to me to be deliberate infidelity. I am as it were engaged to two\r\nwomen and one of them is being deceived. The word \"Deceit\" comes up\r\nagainst me in this double life I lead, and insists I shall name a plain\r\nthing bluntly. There is something very like sheer moral obliquity in\r\nthese entries behind her back.... Is this journal habit slowly\r\ncorrupting my character? Can an engaged or married man conscientiously\r\ncontinue to write his _journal intime_?\r\n\r\nThis question of giving up my faithful friend after September I must\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nOf course most men have something to conceal from someone. Most married\r\nmen are furtive creatures, and married women too. But I have a Gregers\r\nWerle-like passion for life to be lived on a foundation of truth in\r\nevery intercourse. I would have my wife know all about me and if I\r\ncannot be loved for what I surely am, I do not want to be loved for what\r\nI am not. If I continue to write therefore she shall read what I have\r\nwritten....\r\n\r\nMy Journal keeps open house to every kind of happening in my soul.\r\nProvided it is a veritable autochthon--I don't care how much of a\r\ntatterdemalion or how ugly or repulsive--I take him in and--I fear\r\nsponge him down with excuses to make him more creditable in other's\r\neyes. You may say why trouble whether you do or whether you don't tell\r\nus all the beastly little subterranean atrocities that go on in your\r\nmind. Any eminently \"right-minded\" _Times_ or _Spectator_ reader will\r\nask: \"Who in Faith's name is interested in your introspective\r\nmuck-rakings--in fact, who the Devil are you?\" To myself, a person of\r\nvast importance and vast interest, I reply,--as are other men if I could\r\nbut understand them as well. And in the firm belief that whatever is\r\ninexorably true however unpleasant and discreditable (in fact true\r\nthings can never lack a certain dignity), I would have you know Mr.\r\n_Times_- and Mr. _Spectator-reader_ that actual crimes have many a time\r\nbeen enacted in the secrecy of my own heart and the only difference\r\nbetween me and an habitual criminal is that the habitual criminal has\r\nthe courage and the nerve and I have not. What, then, may these crimes\r\nbe? Nothing much--only murders, theft, rape, etc. None of them, thank\r\nGod; fructify in action--or at all events only the lesser ones. My\r\noutward and visible life if I examine it is merely a series of\r\ncommonplace, colourless and thoroughly average events. But if I analyse\r\nmyself, my inner life, I find I am both incredibly worse and incredibly\r\nbetter than I appear. I am Christ and the Devil at the same time--or as\r\nmy sister once called me--a child, a wise man, and the Devil all in one.\r\nJust as no one knows my crimes so no one knows of my good actions. A\r\ngenerous impulse seizes me round the heart and I am suddenly moved to\r\ngive a poor devil a £5 note. But no one knows this because by the time I\r\ncome to the point I find myself handing him a sixpenny-bit and am quite\r\npowerless to intervene. Similarly my murders end merely in a little\r\nphlegm.\r\n\r\n_August_ 7.\r\n\r\n_Two Adventures_\r\n\r\nOn a 'bus the other day a woman with a baby sat opposite, the baby\r\nbawled, and the woman at once began to unlace herself, exposing a large,\r\nred udder, which she swung into the baby's face. The infant, however,\r\ncontinued to cry and the woman said,--\r\n\r\n\"Come on, there's a good boy--if you don't, I shall give it to the\r\ngentleman opposite.\"\r\n\r\nDo I look ill-nourished?\r\n\r\n\"'Arma virumque cano,'\" a beggar said to me this morning in the High\r\nStreet, \"or as the boy said, 'Arms and the man with a dog,' mistaking\r\nthe verb for the noun. Oh! yes, sir, I remember my Latin. Of course, I\r\nfeel it's rather invidious my coming to you like this, but everything is\r\nabsolutely 'non est' with me,\" and so on.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" I answered expansively, \"I am as poor as you are. You at\r\nleast have seen better days you say--but I never have.\"\r\n\r\nHe changed in a minute his cringeing manner and rejoined:\r\n\r\n\"No, I shouldn't think you had,\" eyeing me critically and slinking off.\r\n\r\nAm I _so_ shabby?\r\n\r\n_August_ 8.\r\n\r\nBy Jove! I hope I live! ... Why does an old crock like myself go on\r\nliving? It causes me genuine amazement. I feel almost ashamed of myself\r\nbecause I am not yet dead seeing that so many of my full-blooded\r\ncontemporaries have perished in this War. I am so grateful for being\r\nallowed to live so long that nothing that happens to me except death\r\ncould upset me much. I should be happy in a coal mine.\r\n\r\n_August_12.\r\n\r\nSuffering from indigestion. The symptoms include:\r\n\r\nExcessive pandiculation,\r\n\r\nExcessive oscitation,\r\n\r\nExcessive eructation,\r\n\r\nDyspnœa,\r\n\r\nSphygmic flutters,\r\n\r\nAbnormal porrigo,\r\n\r\nA desiccated epidermis.\r\n\r\n_August_ 16.\r\n\r\n_Lice or \"Creeping Ferlies\"_[5]\r\n\r\nI probably know more about Lice than was ever before stored together\r\nwithin the compass of a single human mind! I know the Greek for Louse,\r\nthe Latin, the French, the German, the Italian. I can reel off all the\r\nbest remedies for Pediculosis: I am acquainted with the measures adopted\r\nfor dealing with the nuisance in the field by the German Imperial Board\r\nof Health, by the British R.A.M.C., by the armies of the Russians, the\r\nFrench, the Austrians, the Italians. I know its life history and\r\nstructure, how many eggs it lays and how often, the anatomy of its\r\nbrain and stomach and the physiology of all its little parts. I have\r\neven pursued the Louse into ancient literature and have read old medical\r\ntreatises about it, as, for example, the _De Phthiriasi_ of Gilbert de\r\nFrankenau. Mucius the lawgiver died of this disease so also did the\r\nDictator Scylla, Antiochus Epiphanes, the Emperor Maximilian, the\r\nphilosopher Pherecydes, Philip II. of Spain, the fugitive Ennius,\r\nCallisthenes, Alcman and many other distinguished people including the\r\nEmperor Arnauld in 899. In 955, the Bishop of Noyon had to be sewn up in\r\na leather sack before he could be buried. (See _Des Insectes reputés\r\nvenimeux_, par M. Amoureux Fils, Doctor of Medicine in the University of\r\nMontpellier, Paris, 1789.) In Mexico and Peru, a poll-tax of Lice was\r\nexacted and bags of these treasures were found in the Palace of\r\nMontezuma (see Bingley, _Animal Biog_., first edition, iii.). In the\r\n_United Service Magazine_ for 1842 (clix., 169) is an account of the\r\nwreck of the _Wager_, a vessel found adrift, the crew in dire straits\r\nand Captain Cheap lying on the deck--\"like an ant-hill.\"\r\n\r\nSo that as an ancient writer puts it, \"you must own that for the\r\nquelling of human pride and to pull down the high conceits of mortal\r\nman, this most loathesome of all maladies (Pediculosis) has been the\r\ninheritance of the rich, the wise, the noble and the mighty--poets,\r\nphilosophers, prelates, princes, Kings and Emperors.\"\r\n\r\nIn his well-known _Bridgewater Treatise_, the Rev. Dr. Kirby, the Father\r\nof English Entomology, asked: \"Can we believe that man in his pristine\r\nstate of glory and beauty and dignity could be the receptacle of prey so\r\nloathesome as these unclean and disgusting creatures?\" (Vol. I., p. 13).\r\nHe therefore dated their creation _after_ the Fall.\r\n\r\nThe other day a member of the staff of the Lister Institute called to\r\nsee me on a lousy matter, and presently drew some live Lice from his\r\nwaistcoat pocket for me to see. They were contained in pill boxes with\r\nlittle bits of muslin stretched across the open end thro' which the\r\nLice could thrust their little hypodermic needles when placed near the\r\nskin. He feeds them by putting these boxes into a specially constructed\r\nbelt and at night ties the belt around his waist and all night sleeps in\r\nElysium. He is not married.\r\n\r\nIn this fashion, he has bred hundreds from the egg upwards and even\r\nhybridised the two different species!\r\n\r\nIn the enfranchised mind of the scientific naturalist, the usual\r\nfeelings of repugnance simply do not exist. Curiosity conquers\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\n_August_ 27.\r\n\r\nAm spending my summer holidays in the Lakes at Coniston with G---- and\r\nR----.... I am simply consumed with pride at being among the mountains\r\nat last! It is an enormous personal success to have arrived at Coniston!\r\n\r\n_August_ 29.\r\n\r\nClimbed a windy eminence on the other side of the Lake and had a\r\nsplendid view of Helvellyn--like a great hog's back. It is fine to walk\r\nover the elastic turf with the wind bellowing into each ear and swirling\r\nall around me in a mighty sea of air until I was as clean-blown and\r\nresonant as a sea-shell. I moved along as easily as a disembodied spirit\r\nand felt free, almost transparent. The old earth seemed to have soaked\r\nme up into itself, I became dissolved into it, my separate body was\r\nmelted away from me, and Nature received me into her deepest\r\ncommunion--until, UNTIL I got on the lee side of a hedge where the calm\r\nbrought me back my gaol of clay.\r\n\r\n_September_ 1.\r\n\r\nFourteen days hence I shall be a married man. But I feel most dejected\r\nabout it. When I fell down the other day, I believe I slightly concussed\r\nmy spinal column, with the result that my 1913 trouble has returned, but\r\nthis time on the _left_ side! paralysis and horrible vertigo and\r\npresentiments of sudden collapse as I walk.\r\n\r\n_September_ 2.\r\n\r\nI fear I have been overdoing it in this tempting mountain region.\r\nWalking too far, etc. So I am slacking. It was fortunate I did not get\r\nconcussion of the brain--I came within an inch of it: the hair of my\r\nhead brushed the ground.\r\n\r\n_A Buxom Rogue in Earthenware_\r\n\r\nI knocked at the door of Sunbeam Cottage the other morning to know if\r\nthey had a boat for hire. The door was promptly opened by a plump,\r\ncharming little wench of about 17, and I caught a glimpse of the kitchen\r\nwith its gunrack holding two fowling pieces, a grandfather clock in one\r\ncorner and a dresser full of blueish china.\r\n\r\n\"We don't let our boat out for hire,\" she answered with a smile so\r\nhonest and natural and spontaneous that I was already saying to myself I\r\nhad never met with anything like it at all when she stretched up her\r\nbare, dairy-maid arm--strong, creamy and soft, just reached a big key\r\nstrung to a wooden block and lying on the top shelf of the dresser and\r\nat once handed it to me with:\r\n\r\n\"But you are quite welcome to use it and here is the key to the\r\nboathouse.\"\r\n\r\nI now felt certain that she was one in a million and thanked her most\r\nawfully. I have never met such swiftly-moving generosity.\r\n\r\n\"It's very nice on the Lake just now,\" she said. \"I like to lie in the\r\nboat with a book and let her drift.\"\r\n\r\nI asked her if she would not come too, but this tight little fairy was\r\ntoo busy in the house. She is Clara Middleton done in earthenware.\r\n\r\nSubsequently R---- and I often visited the cottage and we became great\r\nfriends, her mother showing us some letters she received as a girl from\r\nJohn Ruskin--a great friend of hers. The gamekeeper himself said that\r\nfor his part he could never read Ruskin's books--it was like driving a\r\nspringless cart over a rocky road. We all laughed and I said he was\r\nprejudiced in view of the letters which began: \"My darling,\" and\r\nfinished up \"Yr loving J.R.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. ---- said he had never read them, and Madge (ah! that name!)\r\nsaid her father had never shewn the least interest in them at which we\r\nlaughed again, and the gamekeeper laughed too. He is such a jolly\r\nman--they all are delightfully simple, charming folk and we talked of\r\nBeasts and Birds that live on the mountains.\r\n\r\n_September_ 4.\r\n\r\nBathed in the Lake from the boat. It was brilliantly fine. R---- dipped\r\nher paddles in occasionally just to keep the boat from grounding. Then I\r\nclambered over the bows and stood up to dry myself in the sun like one\r\nof Mr. Tuke's young men.\r\n\r\n_September_ 7.\r\n\r\nMy 26th birthday. In London again. Went straight to the Doctor and\r\nreported myself. I quite expected him to forbid the marriage as I could\r\nscarcely hobble to his house. To my amazement, he apparently made light\r\nof my paralysis, said it was a common accident to bruise the _os\r\ncoccyx_, etc.\r\n\r\n_September_ 8.\r\n\r\nAm staying at ---- for a few days to rest and try to be better by that\r\nfateful 11th, when I am married.\r\n\r\n_Later_: My first experience of a Zeppelin raid. Bombs dropped only a\r\nquarter of a mile away and shrapnel from the guns fell on our roof. We\r\ngot very pannicky and went into a neighbour's house, where we cowered\r\ndown in our dressing-gowns in absolute darkness while bombs exploded and\r\nthe dogs barked.\r\n\r\nI was scared out of my life and had a fit of uncontrollable trembling.\r\nLater we rang up ---- and ----, and thank Heavens both are safe. A great\r\nfire is burning in London, judging by the red glare. At midnight sat and\r\ndrank sherry and smoked a cigar with Mr. ----, my braces depending from\r\nmy trousers like a tail and shewing in spite of dressing-gown. Then went\r\nhome and had some neat brandy to steady my heart. H---- arrived soon\r\nafter midnight. A motor-omnibus in Whitechapel was blown to bits. Great\r\nscenes in the city.\r\n\r\n_September_ 9.\r\n\r\nVery nervy to-day. Hobbled down the road to see the damage done by the\r\nbombs.\r\n\r\n_September_ 10.\r\n\r\nA swingeing cold in the head thro' running about on the night of the\r\nraid. Too feeble to walk far, so Mrs. ---- went into the town for me and\r\npurchased my wedding-ring, which cost £2 5s. 0d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 1917. I am now editing my own Journal--bowdlerising my own book!\r\n\r\n[2] A method of collecting insects in winter by shaking moss over white\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n[3] 1917. Cf. Sainte-Beuve's Essay on Maurice de Guérin: \"Il aimait à se\r\nrépandre et presque à se ramifier dans la Nature. Il a exprimé en mainte\r\noccasion cette sensation diffuse, errante; il y avait des jours ou, dans\r\nson amour ou calme, il enviait la vie forte et muette qui règne sons\r\nl'écorce des chênes; il rêvait à je ne sais quelle métamorphose en\r\narbre....\"\r\n\r\n[4] Cf. 1916, November 6.\r\n\r\n[5] Cf. Burns's poem \"On a Louse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III--MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 12.\r\n\r\nThis evening we walked thro' the Churchyard reading tombstone\r\ninscriptions. What a lot of men have had wives!\r\n\r\nI can't make out what has come over folk recently: the wit, wisdom and\r\nirony on the old tombstones have given place to maudlin sentiment and\r\npious Bible references. Then on the anniversary of the death the custom\r\namong poorer classes is to publish such pathetic doggerel as the\r\nfollowing--cuttings I have taken from time to time from the local\r\nnewspaper in ----:\r\n\r\n     \"Her wish:\r\n\r\n     \"'Farewell dear brother, Mother, sisters,\r\n     My life was passed in love for thee.\r\n     Mourn not for me nor sorrow take\r\n     But love my husband for my sake\r\n     Until the call comes home to thee,\r\n     Live thou in peace and harmony.'\"\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     \"A day of remembrance sad to recall\r\n     But still in my heart he is loved best of all\r\n     No matter how I think of him--his name I oft recall;\r\n     There is nothing left to answer me but his photo on the wall.\"\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n     \"One year has passed since that sad day,\r\n     When one we loved was called away.\r\n     God took her home; it was His will,\r\n     Forget her?--No, we never will.\"\r\n\r\nThese piteous screeds fill me with loving-kindness and with contempt\r\nalternately in a pendulum-like rhythm. What is the truth about them? Is\r\nthe grief of these people as mean and ridiculous as their rhymes? Or is\r\nit a pitiful inarticulateness? Or is it merely vulgar advertisement of\r\ntheir sorrow? Or does it signify a passionate intention never to\r\nforget?--or a fear of forgetting, the rhymes being used as a fillip to\r\nthe memory? Or--most miserable of all--is it just a custom, and one\r\nfollowed in order to appear respectable in others' eyes? Are they poor\r\nsouls? or contemptible fools?\r\n\r\n_September_ 14.\r\n\r\nThere is a ridiculous Cocker spaniel at the house where we are staying.\r\nHe must have had a love affair and been jilted, or else he's a sort of\r\nvillage idiot. The landlady says he's not so silly as he looks--but he\r\nlooks very silly: he languishes sentimentally, and when we laugh at him\r\nhe looks \"hurt.\" To-day we took him up on the Down and it seemed to\r\nbrighten him up. Really, he is sane enough, with plenty of commonsense\r\nand good manners. But he is kept at home in the garden so much, lolling\r\nabout all day, that as E---- said, having nothing to do, he falls in love.\r\n\r\nThe _Saturday Review_ writes: The effect of the \"Brides and the Bath\"\r\nCase on people with any trace of _nice feeling_ is perhaps not\r\nparticularly mischievous, tho' the thing is repulsive and hateful to\r\nthem.... To gloat over the details of repulsive horrors, simply _from\r\nmotives of curiosity_--this is bad and degrading.\r\n\r\nWhat a lot of repulsive things the nice refined people who read the\r\n_Saturday Review_ must find in the world just now. For example the War.\r\n\"Simply from motives of curiosity.\" Why certainly, no other than these,\r\nconcerning one of the most remarkable murders in the annals of crime.\r\nAnd murders anyhow are damned interesting--which the _Saturday Review_\r\nisn't.\r\n\r\n_Chipples_\r\n\r\nI was surprised to discover the other day that when I talked of Chipples\r\nno one understood what I meant! It proves to be a dialect word familiar\r\nto all residents in Devonshire and designating spring onions. Anyway\r\nyou won't find it in Murray's Dictionary; yet etymologically it is an\r\nextremely interesting word and a thoroughly good word with a splendid\r\npedigree. To wit:\r\n\r\nItalian: Cipollo.\r\n\r\nSpanish: Cebolla.\r\n\r\nFrench: Ciboule.\r\n\r\nLatin: Cæpulla, dim. of cæpa (_cf_. cive, civot).\r\n\r\nNow how did this pretty little alien manage to settle down among simple\r\nDevon folk? What has been the relation between Italy and--say Appledore,\r\nor Plymouth?[1]\r\n\r\n_October_ 6.\r\n\r\nIn London once more, living at her flat and using her furniture.\r\n\r\n_The Chalcidoidea_\r\n\r\nThe Chalcidoidea are minute winged insects that parasitise other\r\ninsects, and in the _Memoirs of the Queensland Museum_ (Vol. I., 1912)\r\nyou shall find an enormous catalogue of them by a person named Girault\r\nwho writes the following dedication:\r\n\r\n\"I respectfully dedicate this little portion of work to science, common\r\nsense or true knowledge. I am convinced that human welfare is so\r\ndependent upon science that civilisation would not endure without it,\r\nand that what is meant by progress would be impossible. Also I am\r\nconvinced that the great majority of mankind are too ignorant, that\r\neducation is too archaic and impractical as looked at from the\r\nstandpoint of intrinsic knowledge. There is too little known of the\r\nessential unity of the Universe and of things included, for instance,\r\nman himself. Opinions and prejudices rule in the place of what is\r\ntrue....\"\r\n\r\nPart II. is dedicated to:\r\n\r\n\"The genius of mankind, especially to that form of it expressed in\r\nmonistic philosophy, whose conceived perception is the highest\r\nattainment reached by man.\"\r\n\r\nI can only echo Whistler's remark one day as he stood before an\r\nexecrably bad drawing \"God bless my soul\"--uttered slowly and\r\nthoughtfully and then repeated.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of it is that the Editor adds a serious footnote,\r\ndissociating himself, and a Scarabee to whom I shewed the Work, read it\r\nwith a clouded brow and then said: \"I think it rather out of place in a\r\npaper of this sort.\" (Tableau.)\r\n\r\n_October_ 12.\r\n\r\nDown with influenza.\r\n\r\n_October_ 13.\r\n\r\nA Zeppelin raid last night. I am down with a temperature, but our little\r\nhousehold remained quite calm, thank God. We heard guns going off, and I\r\nhad a fit of trembling as I lay in bed. Many dead of heart failure owing\r\nto the excitement.\r\n\r\n_October_ 14.\r\n\r\nStill in bed. No raid last night. There were two raids on Wednesday, one\r\nat 9.30, and another at midnight. The first time the caretaker of the\r\nflats came up very alarmed to say \"Zeppelins about,\" so we put out the\r\nlights. Then at midnight when everyone else was asleep I heard a big\r\nvoice shout up from the street: \"Lights out there. They're about again.\"\r\nLay still in bed and waited. Distant gunfire.\r\n\r\n_October_ 17.\r\n\r\nBad heart attack.\r\n\r\n_October_ 18.\r\n\r\nHeart intermits. Every three or four minutes. M---- said that I ought to\r\nbe getting used to it by now! Phew!! Very nervy and pusillanimous.\r\nTaking strychnine in strong doses. I hope dear E---- does not catch the\r\n'flu. She swallows quinine with large hopes.\r\n\r\n_October_ 19.\r\n\r\nStaying at R----. Had a ghastly journey down, changing trains twice at\r\nClapham Junction and at Croydon, heart intermitting all the time in\r\nevery position. Poor E---- with me. To-day surprised to find myself still\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n_October_ 20.\r\n\r\nBetter to-day. After much persuasion, I have got E---- to let the flat so\r\nthat we can get away into the country outside the Zeppelin zone.\r\n\r\n_October_ 24.\r\n\r\nBack in London again. Am better, bolstered up with arsenic and\r\nstrychnine. Too nervously excited to do any work.\r\n\r\n_October_ 25.\r\n\r\nThe letting of our flat is now in the hands of an agent, and E----, poor\r\ndear, is quite resigned to abandoning all her precious wallpapers, etc.\r\n\r\n_November_ 7.\r\n\r\nThe flat is let and we are now living in rooms at ----, 20 miles out of\r\nLondon, to the Westward.\r\n\r\n_November_ 8.\r\n\r\nIt is a great relief to be down in the country. Zeppelins terrify me.\r\nHave just had a delightful experience in reading Conrad's new book,\r\n_Victory_--a welcome relief from all the tension of the past two months.\r\nTo outward view, I have been merely a youth getting married, catching\r\nthe 'flu and giving up a London flat.\r\n\r\nInwardly, I have been whizzing around like a Catherine Wheel. Consider\r\nthe items:\r\n\r\nConcussion of the spine.\r\n\r\nResulting paralysis of left leg ten days before marriage.\r\n\r\nZeppelin raid (heard a cannon go off for the first time).\r\n\r\nSevere cold in the head day before marriage (and therefore wild\r\nanxiety).\r\n\r\nSuccessful marriage with abatement of cold.\r\n\r\nReturn to our home.\r\n\r\nTen days later, down with influenza.\r\n\r\nA second Zeppelin raid.\r\n\r\nBad heart attack.\r\n\r\nThen flat sub-let and London evacuated.\r\n\r\nThe record nauseates me. I am nauseated with myself and my\r\nself-centredness.... Suppose I have been \"whizzing\" as I call it--what\r\nthen? They are but subjective trifles--meanwhile other men are seeing\r\ngreat adventures in Gallipoli and elsewhere. \"The _Triumph_ is gone,\"\r\nexclaimed the Admiral who in a little group of naval officers on board\r\nthe flagship had been watching H.M.S. _Triumph_ sink in the Ægean. He\r\nshuts his telescope with a click and returns in great dudgeon to his own\r\nquarters. How I envy all these men who are participating in this\r\nWar--soldiers, sailors, war correspondents--all who live and throb and\r\nare not afraid. I am a timid youth, anæmic, wear spectacles, and am\r\nfrightened by a Zep raid! How humiliating. I hate myself for a\r\nwhite-livered craven: I am suffocated for want of more life and courage.\r\nMy damnable body is slowly killing off all my spirit and buoyancy. Even\r\nmy mind is becoming blurred. My memory is like an old man's exactly.\r\n(Ask ----.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet thro' all my nausea, here I remain happy to discuss myself and my\r\nlittle mishaps. I'm damned sick of myself and all my neurotic\r\nwhimperings, and so I hereby and now intend to lead a new life and throw\r\nthis Journal to the Devil. I want to mangle it, tear it to shreds. You\r\nsmug, hypocritical readers! you'll get no more of me. All you say I know\r\nis true before you say it and I know _now_ all the criticism you are\r\ngoing to launch. So please spare yourself the trouble. You cannot\r\nenlighten me upon myself. I _know_. I disgust myself--and you, and as\r\nfor you, you can go to the Devil with this Journal.\r\n\r\n_Finis_\r\n\r\n_November_ 27.\r\n\r\nTo-day, armed with a certificate from my Doctor in a sealed envelope and\r\naddressed \"to the Medical Officer examining Mr. W.N.P. Barbellion,\" I\r\ngot leave to attend the recruiting office and offer my services to my\r\nKing and Country. At the time, the fact that the envelope was sealed\r\ncaused no suspicion and I had been comfortably carrying the document\r\nabout in my pocket for days past.\r\n\r\nOf course I attended merely as a matter of form under pressure of the\r\nauthorities, as I knew I was totally unfit--but not quite _how_ unfit.\r\nAfter receiving this precious certificate, I learnt that K---- was\r\nrecruiting Doctor at W----, and he offered to \"put me thro' in five\r\nminutes,\" as he knows the state of my health. So at a time agreed upon,\r\nI went to-day and was immediately rejected as soon as he had\r\nstethoscoped my heart. The certificate therefore was not needed, and\r\ncoming home in the train I opened it out of curiosity....\r\n\r\nI was quite casual and thought it would be merely interesting to see\r\nwhat M---- said.\r\n\r\nIt was.\r\n\r\n\"Some 18 months ago,\" it ran, \"Mr. Barbellion shewed the just visible\r\nsymptoms of ---- ----\" and altho' this fact was at once communicated to\r\nmy relatives it was withheld from me and M---- therefore asked the M.O.\r\nto respect this confidence and to reject me without stating on what\r\ngrounds. He went on to refer to my patellar and plantar reflexes, by\r\nwhich time I had had enough, tore the paper up and flung it out of the\r\nrailway carriage window.\r\n\r\nI then returned to the Museum intending to find out what ---- ---- was\r\nin Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine. I wondered whether it was\r\nbrain or heart; and the very thought gave me palpitation. I hope it is\r\nheart--something short and sharp rather than lingering. But I believe it\r\nmust be ---- of the brain, the opposite process of softening occurring in\r\nold age. I recall M----'s words to me before geting married: that I had\r\nthis \"nerve weakness,\" but I was more likely to succumb to pneumonia\r\nthan to any nervous trouble, and that only 12 months' happiness would be\r\nworth while.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the whole I am amazed at the calm way in which I take this news. I\r\nwas a fool never to have suspected serious nerve trouble before. Does\r\ndear E---- know? What did M---- tell her when he saw her before our\r\nmarriage?\r\n\r\n_November_ 28.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I woke up in this clear, country air this morning, I thought:\r\n---- ----. I have decided never to find out what it is. I shall find out\r\nin good time by the course of events.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, the news would have scared me. But not so now. It only\r\ninterests me. I have been happy, merry, and quite high-spirited to-day.\r\n\r\n_December_ 5.\r\n\r\nI believe it's creeping paralysis. My left leg goes lame after a short\r\nwalk. Fortunately E---- does not take alarm.\r\n\r\n_December_ 17.\r\n\r\nSpent the last two days, both of us, in a state of unrelieved gloom. The\r\nclouds never lifted for a moment--it's awful. I scarcely have spoken a\r\nword.... And eugenically, what kind of an infant would even a Mark\r\nTapley expect of a father with a medical history like mine, and a mother\r\nwith a nervous system like hers?... Could anything be more unfortunate?\r\nAnd the War? What may not have happened by this time next year? My\r\nhealth is grotesque.\r\n\r\n_December_ 20.\r\n\r\nI wonder if she knows. I believe she does but I am afraid to broach the\r\nmatter in case she doesn't. I think she must know something otherwise\r\nshe would show more alarm over my leg, and when I went to the Recruiting\r\nOffice she seemed to show no fear whatever lest they took me. Several\r\ntimes a day in the middle of a talk, or a meal, or a kiss, this problem\r\nflashes thro' my mind. I look at her but find no solution. However--for\r\nthe present--the matter is not urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The English Dialect Dictionary derives the word from Old French\r\n_chiboule_, and gives a reference to Piers Plowman. Why hasn't such an\r\nold and useful word become a part of the English language like others\r\nalso brought over at the time of the Norman Conquest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1916\r\n\r\n\r\n_February_ 1.\r\n\r\nSince I last wrote--a month ago--I have recovered my buoyancy after a\r\nblow which kept me under water so long I thought I should never come up\r\nand be happy again.... I was reciting my woes to R----, and gaining\r\nmuch relief thereby, when we espied another crony on the other side of\r\nthe street, crossed over at once, bandied words with him and then walked\r\non, picking up the thread of my lugubrious story just where I had left\r\noff--secretly staggered at my emotional agility. I've got to this\r\nnow,--I simply don't care.\r\n\r\n_February_ 2.\r\n\r\n\"And she draiglet all her petticoatie, Coming thro' the rye.\" These\r\nwords have a ridiculous fascination for me; I cannot resist their\r\nsaccharine, affectionate, nay amorous jingle and keep repeating them\r\naloud all over the house--as Lamb once kept reciting \"Rose Aylmer.\"\r\n\r\n_February_ 16.\r\n\r\nWe took possession of our country cottage to-day: very charming and\r\noverlooking a beautiful Park.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHave just discovered the Journal of the De Goncourts and been reading it\r\ngreedily. Life has really been a commodity. I am boiling over with\r\nvitality, chattering amiably to everyone about nothing--argumentative,\r\nsanguine, serious, ridiculous. I called old R---- a Rapscallion, a\r\nCurmudgeon, and a Scaramouche, and E---- a trull, a drab, a trollop, a\r\ncallet. \"You certainly are a unique husband,\" said that sweet little\r\nlady, and I....\r\n\r\nWith me, one of the symptoms of delirium is always a melodramatic\r\ntruculence! I shake my fist in R----'s face and make him explode with\r\nlaughing.... The sun to-day, and the great, whopping white clouds all\r\nbellied out, made me feel inside quite a bright young dog wriggling its\r\nbody in ecstatic delight let loose upon the green sward.\r\n\r\n\"You must come down for a week end,\" I said to R---- at lunch. \"Come down\r\nas soon as you can. You will find every comfort. It is an enormous\r\nhouse--I have not succeeded in finding my way about it and--it's\r\ndangerous to lose yourself--makes you late for dinner. When you arrive\r\nour gilded janitor will say: 'I believe Mr. Barbellion is in the\r\nlibrary.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Black eunuchs wait on you at dinner, I suppose,\" R---- rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes and golden chandeliers and a marble stair-case--all in barbaric\r\nsplendour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall certainly be glad to come down,\" said R----,\r\nphlegmatically.\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so on. Words, idle words all day in a continuous rush. And\r\nI am sure that the match which fired the gun-powder was the discovery of\r\nthe De Goncourts' Journal! It's extraordinary how I have been going on\r\nfrom week to week quite calmly for all the world as if I had read all\r\nthe books and seen all the places and done everything according to the\r\nheart's desire. This book has really jolted me out of my complacency: to\r\nthink that all this time, I have been dead to so much! Why I might have\r\ndied unconscious that the De Goncourts had ever lived and written their\r\ncolossal book and now I am aware of it, I am all in a fever to read it\r\nand take it up into my brain: I might die now before I have finished\r\nit--a thought that makes me wild with desire just as I once endured most\r\nawful pangs when I felt my health going, and believed that I might die\r\nbefore having ever been in love--to die and never to have been in love!\r\n--for an instant at a time this possibility used to make me writhe.\r\n\r\n_March_ 22.\r\n\r\nR---- has an unpleasant habit of making some scarifying announcement\r\ndrawing forth an explosive query from me and then lapsing at once into\r\nan eleusinian silence: he appears to take a sensuous pleasure in the\r\npause that keeps you expectant. I could forgive a man who keeps you on\r\ntenterhooks for two puffs in order to keep his pipe alight, but\r\nR---- shuts up out of sheer self-indulgence and goes on gazing at the\r\nhorizon with the eyes of a seer (he thinks) trying to cod me he sees a\r\nportent there only revealed to God's elect.\r\n\r\nI told him this in the middle of one of his luxurious silences. \"I will\r\ntell you,\" he said deliberately, \"when we reach the Oratory.\" (We were\r\nin Brompton Road.)\r\n\r\n\"Which side of it?\" I enquired anxiously. \"This or that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said he, \"will depend on how you behave in the meantime.\"\r\n\r\n_April_ 3.\r\n\r\nWe met a remarkable Bulldog to-day in the street, humbly following\r\nbehind a tiny boy to whom it was attached by a piece of string. At the\r\ntime we were following in the wake of three magnificent Serbian\r\nOfficers, and I was particularly interesting myself in the curious cut\r\nof their top boots. But the Bulldog was the Red Herring in our path.\r\n\r\n\"Is that a Dog?\" I asked the little boy.\r\n\r\nHe assured me that it was, and so it turned out to be, tho' Bull-frog\r\nwould have been a better name for it, the forelegs being more bandied,\r\nthe back broader and the mouth wider than in any Bulldog I have ever\r\nseen. It was a super-Bulldog.\r\n\r\nWe turned and walked on. \"There,\" said R----, \"now we have lost our\r\nSerbian Officers.\"\r\n\r\n_April_ 4.\r\n\r\n\"May I use your microscope?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" I said with a gesture of elaborate politeness.\r\n\r\nHe sat down at my table, in my chair, and used my instrument--becoming\r\nat once absorbed and oblivious to my banter as per below:\r\n\r\n\"As Scotchmen,\" I said, \"are monuments rather than men, this latest raid\r\non Edinboro's worthy inhabitants must be called vandalism rather than\r\nmurder.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. I continued to stand by my chair.\r\n\r\n\"How pleased Swift, Johnson, Lamb, and other anti-Caledonians would\r\nbe....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hope you don't mind my occupying your chair a little longer,\" the\r\nScotchman said, \"but this is a larva, has curious maxillæ....\" and his\r\nvoice faded away in abstraction.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no--go on,\" I said, \"I fear it is a grievous absence of hospitality\r\non my part in not providing you with a glass of whiskey. Can I offer you\r\nwater, Sir?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nAnother enthusiast ushered himself in, was greeted with delight by the\r\nfirst and invited to sit down. I pulled out a chair for him and said:\r\n\r\n\"Shave, sir, or hair cut?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you follow along to the top of the galea,\" No. I droned on\r\nimperturbably, \"you will....\" etc.\r\n\r\nI got tired of standing and talking to an empty house but at last they\r\ngot up, apologising and making for the door.\r\n\r\nI entreated them not to mention the matter--my fee should be nominal--I\r\ndid it out of sheer love, etc.\r\n\r\nThey thanked me again and would have said more but I added blandly:\r\n\r\n\"You know your way out?\" They assured me they did (having worked in the\r\nplace for 30 years and more)--I thanked God--and sat down to my table\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n(These reports of conversations are rather fatuous: yet they give an\r\nidea of the sort of person I have to deal with, and also the sort of\r\nperson I am among this sort of person.)\r\n\r\n_April_ 6.\r\n\r\n_The Housefly Problem_--1916\r\n\r\nFor weeks past we have all been in a terrible flutter scarcely\r\nparalleled by the outbreak of Armageddon in August, 1914. The spark\r\nwhich fired almost the whole building was a letter to the _Times_\r\nwritten by Dr. ----, making public an ignominious confession of\r\nignorance on the part of Entomologists as to how the Housefly passed the\r\nwinter. In reply, many correspondents wrote to say they hibernated, and\r\none man was even so temerarious as to quote to us Entomologists the\r\nexact Latin name of the Housefly: viz., _Musca domestica_. We asked for\r\nspecimens and enormous numbers of flies at once began to arrive at the\r\nMuseum, alive and dead--and not a Housefly among them! So there was a\r\nterrible howdedo.\r\n\r\nOne of the correspondents was named \"Masefield.\" \"Not Masefield the\r\npoet?\" an excited dipterist asked. I reassured him.\r\n\r\n\"I've a good mind,\" said Dr. ----, \"to reply to this chap who's so\r\nemphatic and give him a whigging--only he's climbing down a bit in this\r\nsecond letter in to-day's issue.\" I strongly advocated clemency.\r\n\r\nBut still the affair goes on. Every morning sees more letters and more\r\nflies sent by all sorts of persons--we seem to have set the whole world\r\nsearching for Houseflies--Duchesses, signalmen, farmers, footmen. Every\r\nmorning each fresh batch of flies is mounted on pins by experts in the\r\nSetting Room, and an Assistant's whole time is devoted to identifying,\r\narranging, listing and reporting upon the new arrivals. At the last\r\nmeeting of the Trustees a sample collection was displayed to show\r\nindubitably that the insects which hibernate in houses are not _Musca\r\ndomestica_ but _Pollenia rudis_. I understand the Trustees were\r\nappreciative.\r\n\r\nAn observant eye can now discover state visits to our dipterists from\r\ninterested persons carrying their flies with them, animated discussions\r\nin the corridor, knots of excited enthusiasts in the Lavatory, in the\r\nLibrary, everywhere--and everywhere the subject discussed is the same:\r\nHow does the Housefly pass the winter? As one passes one catches: \"In\r\nBakehouses certainly they are to be found but....\" or a wistful voice,\r\n\"I wish I had caught that one in my bathroom three winters ago--I am\r\ncertain it was a Housefly.\" The Doctor himself--a gallant\r\nCaptain--wanders from room to room stimulating his lieutenants to make\r\nsuggestions, and examining every answer to the great interrogative on\r\nits merits, no matter how humble or insignificant the person who makes\r\nit. Then of an afternoon he will entirely disappear, and word goes round\r\nthat he has set forth to examine a rubbish heap in Soho or Pimlico. As\r\nthe afternoon draws to its close someone enquires if he has come back\r\nyet; next morning a second asks if I had seen him, then a third\r\nannounces mournfully that he has just been holding conversation with\r\nhim, but that nothing at all was found in the rubbish heap.\r\n\r\nThe great sensation of all occurred last week when somebody ran along\r\nthe corridor crying that Mr. ---- had just found a Housefly in his room.\r\nWe were all soon agog with the news, and the excited Captain was\r\npresently espied setting out for the scene of operations with a killing\r\nbottle and net. The insect was promptly impounded and identified as a\r\nveritable _Musca domestica_. A consultation being held to sit on the\r\nbody, a lady finally laid information that two \"forced Houseflies\"\r\nhatched the day before had escaped from her possession. She suggested\r\nMr. ----'s specimen was one of them.\r\n\r\n\"How would it get from your room to Mr. ----'s?\" she\r\n\r\nwas immediately asked. And breathless, we all heard her answer\r\ndeliberately and quite audibly that the fugitive may have gone out of\r\nher window, up the garden and in by Mr. ----'s window, _or_ it may have\r\ngone out of her door, up the corridor and in by his door. I wanted to\r\nknow why it should have entered Mr. ----'s room as he is not a dipterist\r\nbut a microlepidopterist. They looked at me sternly and we slowly\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nThis morning, the Dr. came to me with a newspaper cutting in his hand,\r\nsaying, \"_The Times_ is behindhand.\" He handed me the slip. It was a\r\nclipping from to-day's _Times_ about a sackful of flies which had been\r\ntaken from Wandsworth Clock Tower in a state of hibernation.\r\n\r\n\"Behindhand?\" I asked timidly, for I felt that all the story was not in\r\nfront of me.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. Don't you know?\"\r\n\r\nI knew nothing, but was prepared for anything.\r\n\r\n\"_The Star_, two days ago,\" he informed me, \"had a paragraph about\r\nthis--headed 'Tempus fugit' \"--this last in a resentful tone as tho' the\r\nfrivolous reporter were attempting to discredit our mystery.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. Neither of us spoke. Then he slowly said:\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why _The Times_ is so behindhand. This is two days late.\"\r\n\r\n_May_ 5.\r\n\r\nHulloa, old friend: how are you? I mean my Diary. I haven't written to\r\nyou for ever so long, and my silence as usual indicates happiness. I\r\nhave been passing thro' an unbroken succession of calm happy days,\r\nwalking in the woods with my darling, or doing a little gentle gardening\r\non coming home in the evening--and the War has been centuries away.\r\nLater on towards bedtime, E---- reads Richard Jefferies, I play Patience\r\nand Mrs. ---- makes garments for Priscilla.\r\n\r\nThe only troubles have been a chimney which smokes and a neighbour's dog\r\nwhich barks at night. So to be sure, I have made port after storm at\r\nlast--and none too soon. To-day my cheerfulness has been rising in a\r\ncrescendo till to-night it broke in such a handsome crest of pure\r\ndelight that I cannot think of going to bed without recording it.\r\n\r\n_Pachmann_\r\n\r\nAfter sitting on the wall around the fountain in the middle of Trafalgar\r\nSquare, eating my sandwiches and feeding the Pigeons with the crumbs, I\r\nlistened for a moment to the roar of the traffic around three sides of\r\nthe Square as I stood in the centre quite alone, what time one fat old\r\npigeon, all unconcerned, was treading another. It was an extraordinary\r\nexperience: motor horns tooted incessantly and it seemed purposelessly,\r\nso that one had the fancy that all London was out for a joy-ride--it was\r\na great British Victory perhaps, or Peace Day.\r\n\r\nThen walked down Whitehall to Westminster Bridge in time to see the 2\r\no'clock boat start upstream for Kew. I loitered by the old fellow with\r\nthe telescope who keeps his pitch by Boadicea: I saw a piper of the\r\nScots Guards standing near gazing across the river but at nothing in\r\nparticular--just idling as I was. I saw another man sitting on the stone\r\nsteps and reading a dirty fragment of newspaper. I saw the genial,\r\nred-faced sea-faring man in charge of the landing stage strolling up and\r\ndown his small domain,--chatting, jesting, spitting, and making fast a\r\nrope or so. Everything was _alive_ to the finger tips, vividly shining,\r\npulsating.\r\n\r\nArrived at Queen's Hall in time for Pachmann's Recital at 3.15.... As\r\nusual he kept us waiting for 10 minutes. Then a short, fat, middle-aged\r\nman strolled casually on to the platform and everyone clapped\r\nviolently--so it was Pachmann: a dirty greasy looking fellow with long\r\nhair of dirty grey colour, reaching down to his shoulders and an ugly\r\nface. He beamed on us and then shrugged his shoulders and went on\r\nshrugging them until his eye caught the music stool, which seemed to\r\nfill him with amazement. He stalked it carefully, held out one hand to\r\nit caressingly, and finding all was well, went two steps backwards,\r\nclasping his hands before him and always gazing at the little stool in\r\nmute admiration, his eyes sparkling with pleasure, like Mr. Pickwick's\r\non the discovery of the archeological treasure. He approached once more,\r\nbent down and ever so gently moved it about 7/8ths of an inch nearer\r\nthe piano. He then gave it a final pat with his right hand and sat down.\r\n\r\nHe played Nocturne No. 2, Prelude No. 20, a Mazurka and two Etudes of\r\nChopin and Schubert's Impromptu No. 4.\r\n\r\nAt the close we all crowded around the platform and gave the queer,\r\nold-world gentleman an ovation, one man thrusting up his hand which\r\nPachmann generously shook as desired.\r\n\r\nAs an encore he gave us a Valse--\"Valse, Valse,\" he exclaimed\r\necstatically, jumping up and down in his seat in time to the music. It\r\nwas a truly remarkable sight: on his right the clamorous crowd around\r\nthe platform; on his left the seat holders of the Orchestra Stalls,\r\nwhile at the piano bobbed this grubby little fat man playing divine\r\nChopin divinely well, at the same time rising and falling in his seat,\r\nturning a beaming countenance first to the right and then to the left,\r\ncrying, \"Valse, Valse.\" He is as entertaining as a tumbler at a variety\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had finished, we clapped and rattled for more, Pachmann\r\nmeanwhile standing surrounded by his idolaters in affected despair at\r\never being able to satisfy us. Presently he walked off and a scuffle was\r\nhalf visible behind the scenes between him and his agent who sent him in\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nThe applause was wonderful. As soon as he began again it ceased on the\r\ninstant, and as soon as he left off it started again\r\nimmediately--nothing boisterous or rapturous but a steady, determined\r\nthunder of applause that came regularly and evenly like the roar from\r\nsome machine.\r\n\r\n_May_ 20.\r\n\r\nSpent a quiet day. Sat at my escritoire in the Studio this morning\r\nwriting an Essay, with a large 4-fold window on my left, looking on to\r\nwoods and fields, with Linnets, Greenfinches, Cuckoos calling. This\r\nafternoon while E---- rested awhile I sat on the veranda in the sun and\r\nread _Antony and Cleopatra_.... Yes, I'm in harbour at last. I'd be the\r\nlast to deny it but I cannot believe it will last. It's too good to\r\nlast and it's all too good to be even true. E---- is too good to be\r\ntrue, the home is too good to be true, and this quiet restful existence\r\nis too wonderful to last in the middle of a great war. It's just a\r\nlittle deceitful April sunshine, that's all....[1]\r\n\r\nHad tea at the ----. A brilliant summer's evening. Afterwards, we\r\nwandered into the garden and shrubbery and sat about on the turf of the\r\nlawn, chatting and smoking. Mr. ---- played with a rogue of a white\r\nTomcat called Chatham, and E---- talked about our neighbour, \"Shamble\r\nlegs,\" about garden topics, etc. Then I strolled into the drawing-room\r\nwhere Cynthia was playing Chopin on a grand piano. Is it not all\r\nperfectly lovely?\r\n\r\nHow delicious to be silent, lolling on the Chesterfield, gazing\r\nabstractedly thro' the lattice window and listening to the lulling\r\ncharities of Nocturne No. 2, Op. 37! The melody in the latter part of\r\nthis nocturne took me back at once to a cloudless day in an open boat in\r\nthe Bay of Combemartin, with oars up and the water quietly and regularly\r\nlapping the gunwales as we rose and fell. A state of the most profound\r\ncalm and happiness took possession of me.\r\n\r\n_June_ 2.\r\n\r\nFrom the local paper:\r\n\r\n\"A comrade in the Gloucesters writing to a friend at ---- mentions that\r\nPte. J---- has been fatally shot in action. J---- was well known here\r\nfor years as an especially smart young newsvendor.\"\r\n\r\n_June_ 3.\r\n\r\nWhat a bitter disappointment it is to realise that people the most\r\nintimately in love with one another are really separated by such a\r\ndistance. A woman is calmly knitting socks or playing Patience while her\r\nhusband or sweetheart lies dead in Flanders. However strong the tie that\r\nbinds them together yet they are insufficiently _en rapport_ for her to\r\nsense even a catastrophe--and she must wait till the War Office forsooth\r\nsends her word. How humiliating that the War Office must do what Love\r\ncannot. Human love seems then such a superficial thing. Every person is\r\na distinct egocentric being. Each for himself and the Devil take the\r\nhindmost. \"Ah! but she didn't know.\" \"Yes, but she _ought_ to have\r\nknown.\" Mental telepathy and clairvoyance should be common at least to\r\nall lovers.\r\n\r\nThis morning in bed I heard a man with a milkcart say in the road to a\r\nvillager at about 6.30 a.m., \"... battle ... and we lost six cruisers.\"\r\nThis was the first I knew of the Battle of Jutland. At 8 a.m. I read in\r\nthe _Daily News_ that the British Navy had been defeated, and thought it\r\nwas the end of all things. The news took away our appetites. At the\r\nrailway station, the _Morning Post_ was more cheerful, even reassuring,\r\nand now at 6.30 p.m. the Battle has turned into a merely regrettable\r\nindecisive action. We breathe once more.\r\n\r\n_June_ 4.\r\n\r\nIt has now become a victory.\r\n\r\n_June_ 11.\r\n\r\nOld systems of Classification: Rafinesc's Theory of Fives, Swainson's\r\nTheory of Sevens, Edward Newman's book called _Sphinx Vespiformis_\r\ntracing fives throughout the animal world, Sir Thomas Browne's Quincunx,\r\nchasing fives throughout the whole of nature--in the words of Coleridge,\r\n\"quincunxes in Heaven above, quincunxes in the Earth below, quincunxes\r\nin the mind of man, in optic nerves, in roots of trees, in leaves, in\r\neverything!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOld false trails:\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher's Stone (Balthazar Clæs).[2]\r\n\r\nA universal catholicon (Bishop Berkeley's tar-water). Mystical numbers\r\n(as per above).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy father was Sir Thomas Browne and my mother Marie Bashkirtseff. See\r\nwhat a curious hybrid I am!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI toss these pages in the faces of timid, furtive, respectable people\r\nand say: \"There! that's me! You may like it or lump it, but it's true.\r\nAnd I challenge you to follow suit, to flash the searchlight of your\r\nself-consciousness into every remotest corner of your life and invite\r\neverybody's inspection. Be candid, be honest, break down the partitions\r\nof your cubicle, come out of your burrow, little worm.\" As we are all\r\nsuch worms we should at least be honest worms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy gratitude to E---- for plucking me out of the hideous miseries of my\r\nlife in London is greater than I can express. If I were the cheap hero\r\nof a ladies' novel I should immolate my journals as a token, and you\r\nwould have a pretty picture of a pale young man watching his days go up\r\nin smoke by the drawing-room fire. But I have more confidence in her\r\nsterling good sense, and if I cannot be loved for what I am, I do not\r\nwish to be loved for what I am not.\r\n\r\nSince the fateful Nov. 27th, my life has become entirely posthumous. I\r\nlive now in the grave and am busy furnishing it with posthumous joys. I\r\naccept my fate with great content, my one-time restless ambition lies\r\nasleep now, my one-time, furious self-assertiveness is anæsthetised by\r\nthis great War; the War and the discovery about my health together have\r\nplucked out of me that canker of self-obsession. I sit at home here in\r\nthis country cottage in perfect isolation--flattened out by a steam\r\nhammer (tho' it took Armageddon to do it!), yet as cheerful and busy as\r\na Dormouse laying up store for the winter. For I am almost resigned to\r\nthe issue in the knowledge that some day, someone will know, perhaps\r\nsomebody will understand and--immortal powers!--even sympathise, \"the\r\nquick heart quickening from the heart that's still.\"\r\n\r\n_July_ 19.\r\n\r\n_Omniscience_\r\n\r\nAn omniscient Caledonian asked me to-day:\r\n\r\n\"Where are the Celebes? Are they E. or N.E. of the Sandwich Group?\"\r\n\r\nI marked him down at once as my legitimate prey. Sitting back in my\r\nchair, I replied slowly in my most offensive manner:\r\n\r\n\"The Island of Celebes is of enormous size and curious shape situated in\r\nthe Malay Archipelago.\"\r\n\r\nThe Caledonian made no sign. Instead of grinning at his error and\r\nconfessing to a \"floater,\" he endeavoured to carry on by remarking,\r\n\"That of course would be N. of Papua,\" just for all the world as if his\r\nerror was a minor one of latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nIgnoring his comment, I continued:\r\n\r\n\"From the Zoogeographical point of view, Celebes is unequalled in\r\nimportance, having the strangest fauna almost of any island on the face\r\nof the globe. Then there's 'Wallace's Line,'\" I said, being purposely\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\nThe Caledonian said nought but \"looked hurt.\" It was so obvious that he\r\ndidn't know, and it was so obvious that I knew that he didn't know, that\r\nafter my farcical truculence I expected the tension to dissolve in\r\nlaughter. Yet it is hard for a Caledonian to say \"God be merciful to me,\r\nignorant devil that I am.\" So I pursued him with more information about\r\n\"Wallace's Line,\" with an insouciant air, as much as to say, \"Wallace's\r\nLine of course you heard discussed before you were breached.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some do say, you know, that the Line is 'all my eye and Betty Martin,'\r\n_e.g._, R----.\"\r\n\r\nThis gave him his first opportunity of finding his feet in this\r\nperilously deep water. So he said promptly, eager to seem knowledgeable\r\nwith an intelligent rejoinder:\r\n\r\n\"As! yes, R---- is an authority on Fishes.\"\r\n\r\nI assented. \"At the last meeting of the British Ass. he tore the idea to\r\nshreds.\"\r\n\r\nThe drowning Caledonian seized at any straw:\r\n\r\n\"Fishes, however, are not of paramount importance in cases of\r\ngeographical distribution, are they?\"\r\n\r\nI knew he was thinking of _marine_ fishes, but I did not illumine him,\r\nand merely said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes, of very great importance,\" at which he looked still more\r\n\"hurt,\" decamped in silence and left me conqueror of the field but\r\nwithout the spoils of victory: it was impossible to bring him to say \"I\r\ndo not know\"--four mono-syllables was all I wanted from the man who for\r\nmonths past has been lecturing me on all things from Music and the Drama\r\nto Philosophy, Painting and--Insects.\r\n\r\n_July_ 20.\r\n\r\nThe cradle came a few days ago but I had not seen it until this morning\r\nwhen I unlocked the cupboard door, looked in and shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"That's the skeleton in our cupboard,\" I said on coming down to\r\nbreakfast. She laughed, but I really meant it.\r\n\r\nE---- keeps a blue bowl replenished with flaming Poppies in our room.\r\nThe cottage is plagued with Ear-wigs which fly in at night and get among\r\nthe clothes and bedlinen. This morning, dressing, she held up her\r\nchemise to the light saying: \"I always do this--you can see their little\r\nheathen bodies then against the light....\" Isn't she charming?\r\n\r\n_July_ 30.\r\n\r\nThe other day R---- and I were sitting on a stile on the uplands in\r\nperfect summer weather and talking of happy days before the War--he was\r\nin khaki and I was resting my \"gammy\" leg.... As we talked, we let our\r\neyes roam, resting luxuriously wherever we pleased and occasionally\r\ninterrupting the conversation with \"Look at that cow scratching herself\r\nagainst the Oak,\" or \"Do you see the oats waving?\" In the distance we\r\nsaw a man and a boy walking up towards us along the path thro' the corn,\r\nbut the eye having momentarily scrutinised them wandered away and the\r\nconversation never paused. When next I looked, they were much\r\nnearer--crossing the furrows in the potato field in fact, and we both\r\nstopped talking to watch--idly. The boy seemed to be about 10 years old,\r\nand it amused us to see his great difficulty in stepping across the\r\nfurrows.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little chap,\" R---- said, and we laughed.\r\n\r\nThen the boy stumbled badly and all at once the man lifted his\r\nwalking-stick and beat him, saying ill-naturedly, \"Step between the\r\nfurrows,\" and again, \"Step between the furrows.\" Our enchanting little\r\npicture was transfigured in an instant. The \"charming little boy\" was a\r\nnatural idiot--a gross, hefty creature perhaps 30 years of age, very\r\nshort and very thick, dressed in a little sailor suit. I said,\r\n\"Heavens,\" and R---- looked positively scared. We stood aside for them\r\nto get over the stile, the \"boy\" still suffering from his over exertion,\r\nbreathing stertorously like a horse pulling uphill and still evidently\r\nfearful of the big stick behind. He scrambled over the stile as best he\r\ncould, rolling a wild eye at us as he did so--a large, bulgy eye with\r\nthe lower lid swollen and sore, like the eye of a terrified ox on the\r\nway to the slaughter house. So much then for our little picture of\r\ncharming childhood! The man followed close at his heels and looked at me\r\nwith stern defiant eyes. \"Yes, that is my son,\" his eyes declaimed, \"and\r\nI'll thank you to avert your gaze or by the Lord I'll beat you too.\"\r\n\r\n_A Yellow Cat_\r\n\r\nLast week, I saw a yellow cat perched up quite high on a window ledge at\r\nthe S---- Underground Station in celestial detachment from the crowd of\r\nserious, black-coated gentlemen hustling along to and from the trains.\r\nHe had his back turned to us, but as I swept past in the stream, I was\r\nforced to look back a moment, and caught the outline of his whiskers--it\r\nmade me smile intensely to myself and secretly I gave the palm to the\r\ncat for wisdom.\r\n\r\n_July_ 31.\r\n\r\nThis War is so great and terrible that hyperbole is impossible. And yet\r\nmy gorge rises at those fatuous journalists continually prating about\r\nthis \"Greatest War of all time,\" this \"Great Drama,\" this \"world\r\ncatastrophe unparalleled in human history,\" because it is easy to see\r\nthat they are really more thrilled than shocked by the immensity of the\r\nWar. They indulge in a vulgar Yankee admiration for the Big Thing. Why\r\ncall this shameful Filth by high sounding phrases--as if it were a\r\ntragedy from Euripides? We ought to hush it up, not brag about it, to\r\nmention it with a blush instead of spurting it out brazen-faced.\r\n\r\nMr. Garvin, for example, positively gloats over the War each week in the\r\n_Observer_: \"Last week was one of those pivotal occasions on which\r\ndestiny seems to swing\"--and so on every week, you can hear him,\r\nhistorical glutton smacking his lips with an offensive relish.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I never seem to be in the same mind about the War twice\r\nfollowing. Sometimes I am wonderstruck and make out a list of all the\r\namazing events I have lived to see since August, 1914, and sometimes and\r\nmore often I am swollen with contempt for its colossal imbecility. And\r\nsometimes I am swept away with admiration for all the heroism of the\r\nWar, or by some particularly noble self-sacrifice, and think it is\r\nreally all worth while. Then--and more frequently--I remember that this\r\nWar has let loose on the world not only barbarities, butcheries and\r\ncrimes, but lies, lies, lies--hypocrisies, deceits, ignoble desires for\r\nself-aggrandizement, self-preservation such as no one before ever\r\ndreamed existed in embryo in the heart of human beings.\r\n\r\nThe War rings the changes on all the emotions. It twangs all my strings\r\nin turn and occasionally all at once, so that I scarcely know how to\r\nreact or what to think. You see, here am I, a compulsory spectator, and\r\nall I can do is to reflect. A Zeppelin brought down in flames that lit\r\nup all London--now that makes me want to write like Mr. Garvin. But a\r\nForeign Correspondent's eager discussion of \"Italy's aspirations in the\r\nTrentino,\" how Russia insists on a large slice of Turkey, and so forth,\r\nmakes me splutter. How insufferably childish to be slicing up the\r\nearth's surface! How immeasureably \"above the battle\" I am at times.\r\nWhat a prig you will say I am when I sneer at such contemptible little\r\ndevilries as the Bodies' trick of sending over a little note, \"Warsaw is\r\nfallen,\" into our trenches, or as ours in reply: \"Gorizia!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no difference in principle between the case of a man who loses\r\na limb in the service of his country and that of the man who loses his\r\nreason, both have an obvious claim to the grateful recognition of the\r\nState.\"--A morning paper.\r\n\r\nA jejune comment like this makes me grin like a gargoyle! Hark to the\r\nfellow--this leader-writer over his cup of tea. But it is a lesson to\r\nshow how easily and quickly we have all adapted ourselves to the War.\r\nThe War is everything; it is noble, filthy, great, petty, degrading,\r\ninspiring, ridiculous, glorious, mad, bad, hopeless yet full of hope. I\r\ndon't know what to think about it.\r\n\r\n_August_ 13.\r\n\r\nI hate elderly women who mention their legs. It makes me shudder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had two amusing conversations this morning, one with a jealous old man\r\nof 70 summers who, in spite of his age, is jealous--I can find no other\r\nterm--of me in spite of mine, and the other with a social climber. I\r\nalways tell the first of any of my little successes and regularly hand\r\nhim all my memoirs as they appear, to which he as regularly protests\r\nthat he reads very little now.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! never mind,\" I always answer gaily, \"you take it and read it going\r\ndown in the train--it will amuse you.\" He submits but is always silent\r\nnext time I see him--a little, admonitory silence. Or, I mention I am\r\ngiving an address at ----, and he says \"Oom,\" and at once begins his\r\nreminiscences, which I have heard many times before, and am sometimes\r\ntempted to correct him when, his memory failing, he leaves out an\r\nessential portion of his story. Thus do crabbed age and boastful youth\r\ntantalise one another.\r\n\r\nTo the social climber I said slyly:\r\n\r\n\"You seem to move in a very distinguished entourage during your week\r\nends.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled a little self-consciously, hesitated a moment and then said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I have a few nice friends, you know.\"\r\n\r\nNow I am sorry, but though I scrutinised this lick-spittle and arch\r\nbelly-truck rider very closely, I am quite unable to say whether that\r\nsmile and unwonted diffidence meant simple pleasure at the now certain\r\nknowledge that I was duly impressed, or whether it was genuine confusion\r\nat the thought that he had perhaps been overdoing it.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, all bores of whatever kind make a dead set at me. I am\r\nalways a ready listener and my thrusts are always gentle. Hence the\r\npyramids! I constantly act as phlebotomist to the vanity of the young\r\nand to the anecdotage of the senile and senescent.\r\n\r\n_August_ 13.\r\n\r\n... I stood by his chair and looked down at him, and surveyed carefully\r\nthe top of his head, neck, and collar, and with admirable restraint and\r\ncalm, considered my most reasonable contempt of him. In perfect silence,\r\nwe remained thus, while I looked down at a sore spot in the centre of\r\nhis calvarium which he scratches occasionally, and toyed with the fine\r\nflower of my scorn.... But it is a dangerous license to take. One never\r\nknows....\r\n\r\n_Equilibrium Restored_\r\n\r\nTo clear away the cobwebs and to purge my soul of evil thoughts and\r\nbitter feelings, went for a walk this evening over the uplands. Among\r\nthe stubble, I sat down for a while with my back against the corn pook\r\nand listened to the Partridges calling. Then wandered around the edge of\r\nthis upland field with the wind in my face and a shower of delicious,\r\nfresh rain pattering down on the leaves and dry earth. Then into a wood\r\namong tall forest Beeches and a few giant Larches where I rested again\r\nand heard a Woodpecker tapping out its message aloft.\r\n\r\nThis ramble in beautiful B----shire country restored my mental and\r\nspiritual poise. I came home serene and perfectly balanced--my\r\nequilibrium was something like the just perceptible oscillation of tall\r\nLarch-tree tops on the heights of a cliff and the sea below with a just\r\nperceptible swell on a calm and perfect June day. I felt exquisite\r\n--superb. I could have walked all the way home on a tight rope.\r\n\r\n_September_ 2.\r\n\r\nJust recently, I have been going fairly strong. I get frequent colds and\r\nsometimes show unpleasant nerve symptoms, but I take a course of arsenic\r\nand strychnine every month or so in tabloid form, and this helps me over\r\nbad patches.\r\n\r\nUnder the beatific influence of more comfortable health, the rare flower\r\nof my ambition has raised its head once more: my brain has bubbled with\r\nprojects. To wit:\r\n\r\n(1) An investigation of the Balancers in Larval Urodeles.\r\n\r\n(2) The Present Parlous State of Systematic Zoology (for \"Science\r\nProgress\").\r\n\r\n(3) The Anatomy of the Psocidæ.\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nThe strength of my ambition at any given moment is the measure of my\r\nstate of health. It must really be an extraordinarily tenacious thing to\r\nhave hung on thro' all my recent experiences. Considerately enough this\r\ngreat Crab lets go of my big toe when I am sunk low in health, yet\r\npinches devilishly hard as now when I am well.[3]\r\n\r\n_A Bad Listener_\r\n\r\nWhen I begin to speak, T---- will sometimes interrupt with his loud,\r\nrasping voice. I usually submit to this from sheer lack of lung power or\r\nI may have a sore throat. But occasionally after the fifth or sixth\r\ninterruption I lose my equanimity and refuse to give him ground. I keep\r\nstraight on with what I intended to say, only in a louder voice; he\r\nassumes a voice louder still, but not to be denied, I pile Pelion on\r\nOssa and finally overwhelm him in a thunder of sound. For example:\r\n\r\n\"The other day\"--I begin quietly collecting my thoughts to tell the\r\nstory in detail, \"I went to the----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you must come and see my pictures----\" he breaks in; but I go on\r\nand he goes on and as I talk, I catch phrases: \"St. Peters\" or\"Michael\r\nAngelo\" or \"Botticelli\" in wondrous antiphon with my own \"British\r\nMuseum\" and \"I saw there,\" \"two Syracusan,\" \"tetradrachms,\" until very\r\nlikely I reach the end of my sentence before he does his, or perhaps his\r\nrasp drives my remarks out of my head. But that makes no difference, for\r\nrather than give in I go on improvising in a louder and louder voice\r\nwhen suddenly, at length made aware of the fact that I am talking too,\r\nhe stops! leaving me bellowing nonsense at the top of my voice, thus:\r\n\"and I much admired these Syracusan tetradrachms, very charming indeed,\r\nI like them, the Syracusan tetradrachms I mean you know, and it will be\r\ngood to go again and see them (louder) if possible and the weather keeps\r\ndry (louder) and the moon and the stars keep in their courses, if the\r\nslugs on the thorn (loudest)----\" he stops, hears the last few words of\r\nmy remarks, pretends to be appreciative but wonders what in Heaven's\r\nname I can have been talking about.\r\n\r\n_September_ 3.\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of remark I like to make: Someone says to me: \"You\r\n_are_ a pessimist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! well,\" I say, looking infernally deep, \"pessimism is a good policy;\r\nit's like having your cake and eating it at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nChorus: \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because if the future turns out badly you can say, 'I told you so,' to\r\nyour own satisfaction, and if all is well, why you share everyone else's\r\nsatisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nOr I say: \"No, I can't swim; and I don't want to!\"\r\n\r\nChorus: \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is so dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nChorus: \"Why?\"\r\n\r\nThe Infernally Wise Youth: \"For several reasons. If you are a swimmer\r\nyou are likely to be oftener near water and oftener in danger than a\r\nnon-swimmer. Further, as soon as you can swim even only a little, then\r\nas an honourable man, it behoves you to plunge in at once to save a\r\ndrowning person, whereas, if you couldn't swim it would be merely\r\ntempting Providence.\"\r\n\r\nIsn't it sickening?\r\n\r\n_A Jolt_\r\n\r\nYesterday the wind was taken out of my sails. Racing along with\r\nspinnaker and jib, feeling pretty fit and quite excited over some\r\ninteresting ectoparasites just collected on some Tinamous, I suddenly\r\nshot into a menacing dead calm: that stiflingly still atmosphere which\r\nprecedes a Typhoon. That is to say, my eye caught the title of an\r\nenormous quarto memoir in the _Trans. Roy. Soc._, Edinburgh: The\r\nHistology of ---- ----.\r\n\r\nI was browsing in the library at the time when this hit me like a\r\ncarelessly handled gaff straight in the face. I almost ran away to my\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Pink Form just received amazes me! To be a soldier? C'est incroyable,\r\nma foi! The possibility even is distracting! To send me a notice\r\nrequesting me to prepare myself for killing men! Why I should feel no\r\nmore astonished to receive a War Office injunction under dire penalties\r\nto perform miracles, to move mountains, to raise from the dead: My reply\r\nwould be: \"I cannot.\" I should sit still and watch the whole universe\r\npass to its destruction rather than raise a hand to knife a fellow. This\r\nmay be poor, anæmic; but there it is, a positive fact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are moments when I have awful misgivings: Is this blessed Journal\r\nworth while? I really don't know, and that's the harassing fact of the\r\nmatter. If only I were sure of myself, if only I were capable of an\r\nimpartial view! But I am too fond of myself to be able to see myself\r\nobjectively. I wish I knew for certain what I am and how much I am\r\nworth. There are such possibilities about the situation; it may turn out\r\ntremendously, or else explode in a soap bubble. It is the torture of\r\nTantalus to be so uncertain. I should be relieved to know even the\r\nworst. I would almost gladly burn my MSS. in the pleasure of having my\r\ncuriosity satisfied. I go from the nadir of disappointment to the zenith\r\nof hope and back several times a week, and all the time I am\r\nadditionally harassed by the perfect consciousness that it is all petty\r\nand pusillanimous to desire to be known and appreciated, that my\r\nambition is a morbid diathesis of the mind. I am not such a fool either\r\nas not to see that there is but little satisfaction in posthumous fame,\r\nand I am not such a fool as not to realise that all fame is fleeting,\r\nand that the whole world itself is passing away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI smile with sardonic amusement when I reflect how the War has changed\r\nmy status. Before the War I was an interesting invalid. Now I am a lucky\r\ndog. Then, I was a star turn in tragedy; now I am drowned and ignored in\r\nan overcrowded chorus. No valetudinarian was ever more unpleasantly\r\njostled out of his self-compassion. It is difficult to accustom myself\r\nto the new role all at once: I had begun to lose the faculty for\r\nsympathising in others' griefs. It is hard to have to realise that in\r\nall this slaughter, my own superfluous life has become negligible and\r\nscarcely anyone's concern but my own. In this colossal _sauve-qui-peut_\r\nwhich is developing, who can stay to consider a useless mouth? Am I not\r\na comfortable parasite? And, God forgive me, an Egotist to boot?\r\n\r\nThe War is searching out everyone, concentrating a beam of inquisitive\r\nlight upon everyone's mind and character and publishing it for all the\r\nworld to see. And the consequence to many honest folk has been a keen\r\npersonal disappointment. We ignoble persons had thought we were better\r\nthan we really are. We scarcely anticipated that the War was going to\r\ndiscover for us our emotions so despicably small by comparison, or our\r\nhearts so riddled with selfish motives. In the wild race for security\r\nduring these dangerous times, men and women have all been sailing so\r\nclosehauled to the wind that their eyes have been glued to their own\r\nforepeaks with never a thought for others: fathers have vied with one\r\nanother in procuring safe jobs for their sons, wives have been bitter\r\nand recriminating at the security of other wives' husbands. The men\r\nthemselves plot constantly for staff appointments, and everyone is\r\npulling strings who can. Bereavement has brought bitterness and immunity\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nAnd how pathetically some of us cling still to fragments of the old\r\nregime that has already passed--like ship-wrecked mariners to floating\r\nwreckage, to the manner of the conservatoire amid the thunder of all\r\nEurope being broken up; to our newspaper gossip and parish teas, to our\r\ncherished aims--wealth, fame, success--in spite of all, _ruat coelum!_\r\nMr. A.C. Benson and his trickling, comfortable Essays, Mr. Shaw and his\r\nScintillations--they are all there as before, revolving like haggard\r\nwindmills in a devastated landscape! A little while ago, I read in the\r\nlocal newspaper which I get up from the country two columns concerning\r\nthe accidental death of an old woman, while two lines were used to\r\nrecord the death of a townsman at the front from an aerial dart. Behold\r\nthis poor rag! staggering along under the burden of the War in a\r\npassionate endeavour to preserve the old-time interest in an old woman's\r\ndecease. Yet more or less we are all in the same case: I still write my\r\nJournal and play Patience of an evening, and an old lady I know still\r\nreads as before the short items of gossip in the papers, neglecting\r\narticles and leaders.... We are like a nest of frightened ants when\r\nsomeone lifts the stone. That is the world just now.\r\n\r\n_September_ 5.\r\n\r\n... I was so ashamed of having to fall back upon such ignominious\r\npublications for my literary efforts that on presenting him with two\r\ncopies, I told the following lie to save my face:\r\n\r\n\"They were two essays of mine left over at the beginning of the War, you\r\nknow. My usual channel became blocked so I had to have recourse to\r\nthese.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you publish as a rule?\" he innocently asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! several in the _Manchester Guardian_,\" I told him out of vanity.\r\n\"But of course every respectable journal now has closed down to\r\nextra-war topics.\"\r\n\r\nI lie out of vanity. And then I confess to lying--out of vanity too. So\r\nthat one way or another I am determined to make kudos out of myself.\r\nEven this last reflection is written down with an excessive appreciation\r\nof its wit and the intention that it shall raise a smile.\r\n\r\n_September_ 9.\r\n\r\nStill nothing to report. The anxiety is telling on us all. The nurse has\r\nanother case on the 22nd.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI looked at myself in the mirror this morning--nude, a most revolting\r\npicture. An emaciated human being is the most unlovely thing in\r\ncreation. Some time ago a smart errand boy called out \"Bovril\" after me\r\nin the street.\r\n\r\nOn my way to the Station met two robust, brawny curates on the way to\r\nthe daily weekday service--which is attended only by two decrepit old\r\nwomen in black, each with her prayer-book caught up to her breast as if\r\nshe were afraid it might gallop off. That means a parson apiece--and in\r\nwar time too.\r\n\r\n_September_ 10.\r\n\r\nMy sympathy with myself is so unfailing that I don't deserve anybody\r\nelse's. In many respects, however, this Journal I believe gives the\r\nimpression that I behave myself in the public gaze much worse than I\r\nactually do. You must remember that herein I let myself go at a stretch\r\ngallop: in life I rein in, I am almost another person. Would you believe\r\nit, E---- says I am full of quick sympathy with others and\r\nextraordinarily cheerful, nay gay. Verily I lead a curious double\r\nexistence: among most people, I pass for a complaisant, amiable,\r\nmealy-mouthed, furry if conceited creature. Here I stand revealed as a\r\ncontemptuous, arrogant malcontent. My life has embittered me _an fond_,\r\nI have the crabbed temper of the disappointed man insufficiently\r\ndeveloped yet to be very plainly visible beneath my innate affable,\r\nunassuming, humble, diffident, cheerful characteristics. With fools on\r\nevery hand I am becoming insolent, aggressive, self-declamatory. Last\r\nevening came home and got down Robert Buchanan's sonnet, \"When He\r\nreturns and finds the world so drear,\" and felt constrained to read it\r\nout to E----. I poured out its acid sentiment with the base revenge of a\r\nvitriol thrower, and then became quiescent.\r\n\r\nIt is a helpless feeling, sitting still and watching circumstances\r\npounding away at my malleable character and moulding it wrongly.\r\n\r\n_September_ 14.\r\n\r\n_An American Neighbour_\r\n\r\nWe have a delightful American neighbour here whose life revolves like\r\nthe fly-wheel of an engine. Even when not in eruption his volcanic\r\nenergy is always rumbling and can be heard. Seeing he is a globe\r\ntrotter, I was surprised to observe his most elaborate precautions for\r\ncatching the train and getting a seat when he takes his wife and family\r\nto town. He first of all plants himself and all his property down at a\r\ncertain carefully selected point along the platform as if he were in the\r\nwild west lying in wait for a Buffalo. Then as the train comes in, his\r\neye fixes on an empty compartment as it passes and he dashes off after\r\nit in furious pursuit up the platform, shouting to his family to follow\r\nhim. Having lassooed the compartment, squaw and piccaninnies are hustled\r\nin as if there was not a moment to lose, what time the black-coated,\r\nsuburban Englishmen look on in pain and silence, and then slowly with\r\noffensive deliberation enter their respective carriages.\r\n\r\n_The Stockbroker_\r\n\r\nAnother neighbour who interests me is mainly notable for his\r\nextraordinary gait. He is a man with a large, round head, a large round,\r\ndissolute looking face and fairly broad shoulders, below which\r\neverything tapers away to a pair of tiny feet neatly booted. These two\r\nlittle feet are excessively sensitive to road surface--one would say he\r\nhad special sense organs on his toes, to judge by the manner in which he\r\npicks out his path along the country road in short, quick, fussy steps:\r\nhis feet seem to dissect out the road as if boning a herring. A big\r\nbunion is as good as a sense organ, but his feet are too small and\r\nelegant.\r\n\r\n_September_ 24.\r\n\r\nThe second nurse arrived to-day. Great air raid last night of which we\r\nheard nothing, thank God!\r\n\r\nMy nerves are giving way under the strain.... One leg (the left) drags\r\nabominably.... We shall want a bath-chair as well as a perambulator.\r\n\r\nCrawled up thro' the path-fields to the uplands and sat in a field in\r\nthe sun with my back against a haystack. I was so immobile in my\r\ndejection that Flies and Grass-hoppers came and perched about me. This\r\nmade me furious. \"I am not dead yet,\" I said, \"get away,\" and I would\r\nsuddenly drive them off.... In horrible dejection....\r\n\r\nEven my mental powers are disintegrating--that's the rub. Some quite\r\nrecent incidents I cannot remember even when reminded of them: they seem\r\nto have passed clean out of my mind--a remarkable sensation this.\r\n\r\nMy sensibility is dulled too. It chagrins me to find that my present\r\nplight by no means overwhelms me with anguish as it would have done\r\nonce. It only worries me. I am just a worried ox.\r\n\r\n_September_ 26.\r\n\r\nThe numbness in my right hand is getting very trying. ... The Baby puts\r\nthe lid on it all. Can't you see the sordid picture? I can, and it\r\nhaunts me. To be paralysed with a wife and child and no money--ugh!\r\n\r\nRetribution proceeds with an almost mathematical accuracy of measure. It\r\nwould necessitate a vernier rather than a chain. There is no mercy in\r\nCause and Effect. It is inhuman clockwork. Every single act expended\r\nbrings one its precise equivalent in return....\r\n\r\n_September_ 28.\r\n\r\nStill nothing to report.\r\n\r\nI am astonished at the false impression these entries give of myself.\r\nThe picture is incomplete anyhow. It represents the cloud of forebodings\r\nover my inner self but does not show the outward front I present to\r\nothers. This is one of almost constant gaiety--unforced and quite\r\nnatural. Ask E----, who said yesterday I was like a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n     \"Camerade, I give you my hand!\r\n     I give you my love more precious than money,\r\n     I give you myself before preaching or law;\r\n     Will you give me yourself? Will you come, travel with me?\r\n     Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?\"\r\n\r\nShe cut this out of her copy of Walt Whitman and gave it me soon after\r\nour engagement. It is very precious to me.\r\n\r\n(On Sept. 29th, on the Doctor's advice I went away by the sea alone, my\r\nnerves being all unstrung. For an account of the miseries of this\r\njourney, see Dec. 12th _infra_).\r\n\r\n_October_ 3.\r\n\r\nA wire to say Susan arrived 2.15 p.m. All well.\r\n\r\n_October_ 5.\r\n\r\nHome again with my darling. She is the most wonderful darling woman. Our\r\nlove is for always. The Baby is a monster.\r\n\r\n_October_ 23.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I can't write, finally bottles me up.[4] Damn! Damn! Damn!\r\nIf only I can get my Essay on Journal Writers done. E---- goes on well.\r\nI have a thousand things to say.\r\n\r\n_October_ 27.\r\n\r\nStill awaiting a reprieve. I hate alarming the Doctor--he's such a\r\ncheerful man so I conceal my symptoms, quite a collection by now.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of breaking the news to her makes me miserable. I hide away\r\nas much as possible lest she should see. I _must_ speak when she is well\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n_October_ 28.\r\n\r\nLife has been very treacherous to me--this, the greatest treachery of\r\nall. But I don't care. I exult over it. Last night I lay awake and\r\nlistened to the wind in the trees and was full of exultation.\r\n\r\nNow I can only talk, but nobody to talk to. Shall hire a row of\r\nbroomsticks. More and more, the War appears to me a tragic hoax.\r\n\r\n_November_ 1.\r\n\r\nE---- has had a set-back and is in bed again. However sclerotic my nerve\r\ntissue, I feel as flaccid as a jelly.\r\n\r\nMy God! how I loathe the prospect of death.\r\n\r\n_November_ 3.\r\n\r\nI must have some music or I shall hear the paralysis creeping. That is\r\nwhy I lie in bed and whistle.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Brown, what am I to do?\"[5] (I like to dramatise myself like\r\nthat--it is an anodyne).\r\n\r\nI feel as if I were living alone on Ascension Island with the tide\r\ncoming up continuously, up and up and up.\r\n\r\n_November_ 6.\r\n\r\nShe has known _all_ from the beginning! M---- warned her _not_ to marry\r\nme. How brave and loyal of her! What an ass I have been. I am\r\noverwhelmed with feelings of shame and self-contempt and sorrow for her.\r\nShe is quite cheerful and an enormous help.\r\n\r\n_November_ 12.\r\n\r\nWhat a wreck my existence has become and--dragging down others with me.\r\n\r\nIf only I could rest assured that after I am dead these Journals will be\r\ntenderly cared for--as tenderly as this blessed infant! It would be\r\ncruel if even after I have paid the last penalty, my efforts and\r\nsufferings should continue to remain unknown or disregarded. What I\r\nwould give to know the effect I shall produce when published! I am\r\ntortured by two doubts--whether these MSS. (the labour and hope of many\r\nyears) will survive accidental loss and whether they really are of any\r\nvalue. I have no faith in either.\r\n\r\n_November_ 14.\r\n\r\nIn fits of panic, I keep saying to myself: \"My dear Brown, what am I to\r\ndo?\" But where is Brown? Brown, you devil! where are you?\r\n\r\n... To think how I have acted the Prince to her when really I am only a\r\nbeggar!\r\n\r\n_November_ 16.\r\n\r\nA little better and more cheerful: altho' my impregnable colon still\r\nholds out.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if a physician from London one of these days were to\r\ngallop up hotspur, tether his horse to the gate post and dash in waving\r\na reprieve--the discovery of a cure!\r\n\r\n... I was in an impish mood and said: \"Oh! dear, I'm full of misery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly,\" she said, \"so am I.\"\r\n\r\n_November_ 17.\r\n\r\nE---- has been telling me some of her emotions during and after her\r\nfateful visit to my Doctor just before our marriage. He did not spare\r\nher and even estimated the length of my life after I had once taken to\r\nmy bed--about 12 months. I remember his consulting room so well--all its\r\nfurniture and the photograph of Madam Blavatsky over the door, and I\r\npicture her to myself sitting opposite to him in a sullen silence\r\nlistening to the whole lugubrious story. Then she said at last: \"All\r\nthis won't make any difference to me.\" She went home to her mother in a\r\ndream, along the streets I have followed so often. I can follow all her\r\nfootsteps in imagination and keep on retracing them. It hurts, but I do\r\nso because it seems to make her some amends for my being childishly\r\nunconscious at the time. Poor darling woman--if only I had known! My\r\ninstinct was right--I felt in my bones it was wrong to marry, yet here\r\nwas M---- urging me on. \"You marry,\" her mother said to her, \"I'll stand\r\nby you,\" which was right royal of her. There followed some trying months\r\nof married life with this white hot secret in her bosom as a barricade\r\nto perfect intimacy; me she saw always under this cloud of crude\r\ndisgusting pathos making her say a hundred times to herself: \"He doesn't\r\nknow;\" then Zeppelin raids and a few symptoms began to grow obvious,\r\nuntil what before she had to take on trust from the Doctor came\r\ndiabolically true before her eyes. Thank God that's all over at last. I\r\nknow her now for all she is worth--her loyalty and devotion, her courage\r\nand strength. If only I had something to give her in return! something\r\nmore than the dregs of a life and a constitutional pessimism. I greatly\r\ndesire to make some sacrifice, but I am so poor these days, so very much\r\na pauper on her charity, there is no sacrifice I can make. Even my life\r\nwould scarcely be a sacrifice in the circumstances--it is hard not to be\r\nable to give when one _wants_ to give.\r\n\r\n_November_ 20.\r\n\r\nIn the doldrums. Tired of this damnable _far niente_,--I am being gently\r\nsmothered under a mountain of feathers. I should like to engage upon\r\nsome cold, hard, glittering intellectualism.\r\n\r\n\"I want to read Kant,\" I said. The Baby slept, E---- was sewing and\r\nN---- writing letters. I leaned back in my armchair beside the bookshelf\r\nand began to read out the titles of my books in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\"My dear!\" E---- said.\r\n\r\n\"I am caressing my past,\" I answered. \"Wiedersheim's _Comparative\r\nAnatomy of Vertebrates_, Smith Woodward's _Vertebrate Palæontology_--why\r\nit's like visiting old prospects and seeing how the moss has grown over\r\nthe stones.\"\r\n\r\nI hummed a comic song and then said: \"As I can't burn the house down, I\r\nshall go to bed.\"\r\n\r\nN----: \"You can talk if you like, it won't interfere.\"\r\n\r\nE----: \"He's talking to his besoms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I said to N----, absent-mindedly.\r\n\r\nE----: \"You ought to have said 'Thank you.'\"\r\n\r\nI blew out my cheeks and E---- laughed.\r\n\r\nN----: \"How do you spell 'regimental'?\"\r\n\r\nI told her--wrongly, and E---- said I was in a devilish mood.\r\n\r\n\"If we say that we have no sin\" I chanted in reply, \"we deceive\r\nourselves and the truth is not in us.\" I next gave a bit out of a\r\nspeech by Disraeli with exaggerated rhetorical gestures.\r\n\r\nE---- (with pity): \"Poor young man.\"\r\n\r\nPresently she came over and in a tired way put her arms around my neck\r\nso I immediately began to sing \"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,\" in the\r\nbass, which immediately reminded me of dear old Dad, whose favourite\r\nhymn it was.... Then I imitated the Baby. And then to bed fretful and\r\nvery bitter.\r\n\r\n_November_ 27.\r\n\r\n... I wish I could die of heart failure--and at once! What a luxury that\r\nwould be as compared with my present prospect!\r\n\r\nA Tomtit on the fence this morning made me dissolve in tears:--self-pity\r\nI believe. I remember Tomtits in ----shire. Put on a gramophone record\r\nand--ugh! but I'm too sick to write.\r\n\r\n_November_ 28.\r\n\r\nThe shock I gave my spinal column in 1915 up in the Lakes undoubtedly\r\nre-awakened activity among the bacteria. Luck for you! I, of all persons\r\nto concuss my spine!!\r\n\r\n... I listen to the kettle singing, I look at the pictures in the fire,\r\nread a bit, ask what time it is, see the Baby \"topped and tailed,\" yawn,\r\nblow my nose, put on a gramophone record--I have the idea of passing on\r\nthe midnight with no pain to the tune of some healing ragtime.\r\n\r\n_November_ 29.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary of our engagement day two years ago. How mad the idea of\r\nmarriage seemed to me--and my instinct was right: if only I had known!\r\nYet she says she does not regret anything.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis morning I turned to read with avidity accounts of the last hours of\r\nKeats, Gibbon, Oscar Wilde and Baudelaire. I gained astonishing comfort\r\nout of this, especially in the last ... who died of G.P.I. in a Brussels\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE---- is awfully courageous and,--as usual ready to do everything in her\r\npower. How can I ever express sufficient gratitude to these two dear\r\nwomen (and my wife, above all) for casting in their lot knowingly with\r\nmine?\r\n\r\n_December_ 1.\r\n\r\nI believe I am good for another 12 months without abnormal worries. Just\r\nnow, of course, the Slug ain't exactly on the thorn--on the cabbage in\r\nfact as E---- suggested. The Grasshopper is much of a burden and the\r\nvoice of the Turtle has gone from my land (where did all these Bible\r\nphrases come from?). The first bark of the Wolf (God save us, 'tis all\r\nthe Animal Kingdom sliding down my penholder) was heard with the\r\nreduction in her work to-day, and I suspect there's worse to come with a\r\nsovereign already only worth 12s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_December_ 4.\r\n\r\nThe Baby touch is the most harrowing of all. If we were childless we\r\nshould be merely unfortunate, but an infant....\r\n\r\n_December_ 11.\r\n\r\nAm receiving ionisation treatment from an electrical therapeutist--a\r\nquack! He is a sort of electrician--still, if he mends my bells I'll\r\nkiss his boots. As for ----, he is no better than a byreman, and I call\r\nhim Hodge. This is not the first time I have felt driven to act behind\r\nthe back of the Profession. In 1912, being desperate, and M---- worse\r\nthan a headache, I greedily and credulously sucked in the advice of my\r\nboarding-house proprietor and went to see a homœopathist in Finsbury\r\nCircus. He proved to be a charlatan at 10s. 6d. a time, and tho' I\r\nrealised it at once, I religiously travelled about for a month or more\r\nwith tinctures and drop-bottle. I could write a book on the Doctors I\r\nhave known and the blunders they have made about me.... The therapeutist\r\ntook me for 33. I feel 63. I am 27. What a wreck I am, and....\r\n\r\n_December_ 12.\r\n\r\nIt is so agreeable to be able to write again that I write now for the\r\nsheer physical pleasure of being able to use a pen and form letters.\r\n\r\n_An Adventure in Search of Health_\r\n\r\nAbout the end of September, I began to feel so ill that Nurse went for\r\nthe Doctor who assured me that E---- was all right--I need not\r\nworry--\"You go away at once and get some fresh air,\" and so forth. \"I\r\nfeel quite ill,\" I said, struggling to break the news.\r\n\r\n\"Sort of nervous?\" he enquired good-naturedly, \"run down? I should get\r\nright away at once.\"\r\n\r\nI began tentatively. \"Well, I have a rather long medical history and\r\nperhaps ... you ... might care to read the certificate of my London\r\nDoctor?\"\r\n\r\nI went to my escritoire and returned with M----'s letter addressed to\r\n\"The M.O. examining Mr. B.\"\r\n\r\nHodge pulled out the missive, studied the brief note carefully and long,\r\nat the same time drawing in his breath--deeply, and gnawing the back of\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"I know all about it,\" I said to relieve him.\r\n\r\n\"Is it quite certain? about this disease?\" he said presently. \"You are\r\nvery young for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there is no doubt,\" and he began to put me thro' the usual\r\ntricks.\r\n\r\n\"I should go right away at once,\" he said, \"and go on with your arsenic.\r\nAnd whatever you do--don't worry--your wife is all right.\"\r\n\r\nAfter beseeching him to keep silence about it as I thought she did not\r\nknow, I shewed him out and locked up the certificate again.\r\n\r\nNext morning I felt thoroughly cornered: I was not really fit enough to\r\ntravel; my hand and leg were daily growing more and more paralysed and\r\nJ---- wired to say she could not put me up as they were going away for\r\nthe week end. So I wired back engaging rooms, as with the nurse in the\r\nhouse and E---- as she was, I simply could not stay at home....\r\n\r\nOn the way to the Station I was still in two minds whether or not to\r\npull the taxi up at the Nursing Home and go inside, but harassing debate\r\nas it was, our rapidly diminishing bank balance finally drove me on.\r\n\r\n---- came up to London with me and sought out a comfortable corner seat,\r\nbut by the time the train left, a mother and a crying child had got in\r\nand everywhere else was full. A girl opposite who saw ---- hand me a\r\nbrandy flask and knew I was ill, looked at me compassionately.\r\n\r\nAt Reading, another woman with a baby got in and both babies cried in\r\nchorus, jangling my nerves to bits!--until I got out into the corridor,\r\nby a miracle not falling down, with one leg very feeble and treacherous.\r\nAll seats were taken, excepting a first-class compartment where I looked\r\nin enviously at a lucky youth stretched out asleep full length along the\r\nempty seat.\r\n\r\nAll the people and the noise of the train began to make me fret, so I\r\nsought out the repose of a lavatory where I remained eating sandwiches\r\nand an apple for the best part of an hour. It was good to be alone.\r\n\r\nLater on, I discovered an empty seat in a compartment occupied by\r\npersons whose questionable appearance my short sight entirely failed to\r\nmake me aware of until I got inside with them. They were a family of\r\nSheenies, father, mother and three children, whose joint emanations in a\r\nclosed-up railway carriage made an effluvium like to kill a regiment of\r\nguards. They were E. end pawnbrokers or dealers in second-hand clothes.\r\n\r\nI was too nervous to appear rude by immediately with-drawing, so I said\r\npolitely to the man clad in second-hand furs: \"Is that seat taken?\"\r\n\r\nHe affected to be almost asleep. So I repeated. He stared at me and then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes ... but you can have it for a bit if you like.\"\r\n\r\nI sat down timorously on the extreme edge of the seat and stared at, but\r\ncould not read, my newspaper out of sheer nervous apprehension. My sole\r\nidea was to get out as soon as I decorously could. Out of the corner of\r\nmy eye, I observed the three children--two girls and a boy--all garbed\r\nin black clothes and wearing large clumsy boots with nails and scutes on\r\nthe soles. The girls had large inflorescences of bushy hair which they\r\nswung about as they turned their heads and made me shudder. The mother's\r\nface was like a brown, shrivelled apple, topped with a black bonnet and\r\nfestooned on each side with ringlets of curly dark hair. Around her neck\r\na fur tippet: as I live--second-hand clothes dealers from Whitechapel.\r\n\r\nThe man I dare not look at: I sat beside him and merely imagined.\r\n\r\nAt ----, I got a decent seat and arrived at T---- jaded, but still\r\nalive, with no one to meet me. Decent rooms on the sea-front.\r\n\r\nNext morning J---- went away for the week end and I could not possibly\r\nexplain how ill I was: she might have stayed at home.\r\n\r\nTo preserve my sanity, Saturday afternoon, took a desperate remedy by\r\nhiring a motor-car and travelling to Torquay and back _via_\r\nBabbacombe....\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday, feeling suddenly ill, I sent for the local medico whom I\r\nreceived in the drab little room by lamplight after dinner. \"I've a\r\ntingling in my right hand,\" I said, \"that drives me nearly silly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on the soles of your feet?\" he asked at once.\r\n\r\nI assented, and he ran thro' at once all the symptoms in series.\r\n\r\n\"I see you know what my trouble is,\" I said shyly. And we chatted a\r\nlittle about the War, about disease, and I told him of the recent memoir\r\non the histology of the disease ---- in the _Trans. Roy. Soc_, Edin.\r\nwhich interested him. Then he went away again--very amiable, very polite\r\n--an obvious _non possumus_....\r\n\r\nOn Monday at 4 went up to ---- to tea as previously arranged, but found\r\nthe house shut up so returned to my rooms in a rage.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, having read the newspapers inside out, sat by the open window\r\nlooking out on to the Marine Parade. It was dusk, a fine rain was\r\nfalling, and the parade and sea-front were deserted save for an\r\noccasional figure hurrying past with mackintosh and umbrella. Suddenly\r\nas I sat looking out on this doleful scene, a dirge from nowhere in\r\nparticular sounded on my ears which I soon recognised as \"Robin Adair,\"\r\nsung very _lento_ and very _maestoso_ by a woman, with a flute obligato\r\nplayed by some second person. The tide was right up, and the little\r\nwaves murmured listlessly at long intervals: never before I think have I\r\nbeen plunged into such an abyss of acute misery.\r\n\r\nNext day the wire came. But it was too late. The day after that, I was\r\nworse, a single ray of sunshine being the rediscovery of the\r\nsecond-hand-clothes family from Whitechapel taking the air together on\r\nthe front. This dreary party was traipsing along, the parents in their\r\nfurs giving an occasional glance at the sea uncomfortably, as if they\r\nonly noticed it was wet, and the children still in black and still\r\nwearing their scuted boots, obviously a little uncomfortable in a place\r\nso clean and windswept. I think they all came to the seaside out of\r\ndecorum and for the satisfaction of feeling that they could afford it\r\nlike other folk, and that old-clothes was as profitable a business as\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, returned home as I was afraid of being taken ill and having\r\nto go into the public hospital. Arrived home and went to bed and here we\r\nare till Jan. 1st on 3 months' sick leave. However, the swingeing\r\nurtication in my hands and feet has now almost entirely abated and\r\nto-day I went out with E---- and the perambulator, _which I pushed_.\r\n\r\n_December_ 13.\r\n\r\n_A Baby-Girl_\r\n\r\nWalked down the bottom of the road and hung over some wooden railings. A\r\nlittle village baby-girl aged not more than 3 was hovering about near\r\nme while I gazed abstractedly across the Park at the trees. Presently,\r\nshe crawled through the railings into the field and picked up a few dead\r\nleaves--a baby picking up dead leaves! Then she threw them down, and\r\nkicked them. Then moved on again--rustling about intermittently like a\r\nwinter Thrush in the shrubbery. At last, she had stumbled around to\r\nwhere I was leaning over the railings. She stood immediately in front of\r\nme and silently looked up with a steady reproachful gaze: \"Ain't you\r\n'shamed, you lazy-bones?\" till I could bear her inquisitorial gaze no\r\nlonger, and so went and hung over some more railings further on.\r\n\r\n_Service_\r\n\r\nHe asked for a Tennyson. She immediately went upstairs in the dark, lit\r\na match and got it for him.\r\n\r\nHe asked for a Shakespeare. And without a moment's hesitation, she went\r\nupstairs again, lit another match and got that for him.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe if he had said \"Rats,\" she would have shot out silently\r\ninto the dark and tried to catch one for him. Only a woman is capable of\r\nsuch service.\r\n\r\n_Hardy's Poetry_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \"You did not come,\r\n     And marching time drew on and wore me numb--\r\n     Yet less for loss of your dear presence there\r\n     Than that I thus found lacking in your make\r\n     That high compassion which can overbear\r\n     Reluctance for pure loving-kindness' sake\r\n     Grieved I, _when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum_,\r\n                                     You did not come.\"\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy Hardy's poetry for its masterfulness, for his sheer\r\nmuscular compulsion over the words and sentences. In his rough-hewn\r\nlines he yokes the recalcitrant words together and drives them along\r\nmercilessly with something that looks like simple brute strength.\r\nWitness the triumphant last line in the above where the words are\r\nabsolute bondslaves to his exact meaning, his indomitable will. All\r\nthis pleases me the more for I know to my cost what stubborn, sullen,\r\nhephæstian beasts words and clauses can sometimes be. It is nice to see\r\nthem punished. Hardy's poetry is Michael Angelo rather than Greek,\r\nBrowning not Tennyson.\r\n\r\n_December_ 14.\r\n\r\nWhat a day! After a night of fog signals, I awoke this morning to find\r\nit still foggy and the ground covered with a grey rime. All day the fog\r\nhas remained: I look out now thro' the yellowish atmosphere across a\r\nfield which is frosted over, the grass and brambles stiff and glassy. My\r\nback is aching and the cold is so intense that unless I crouch over the\r\nfire hands and feet become immediately stone-cold. All day I have\r\ncrouched over the fire, reading newspapers, listening to fog signals and\r\nthe screaming of the baby.... I have been in a torpor, like a Bat in a\r\ncavern--really dead yet automatically hanging on to life by my hind\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n_December_ 15.\r\n\r\n\"To stand upon one's guard against Death exasperates her malice and\r\nprotracts our sufferings.\" W.S. Landor.\r\n\r\n_December_ 19.\r\n\r\nThe Parson called, over the christening of the baby. I told him I was an\r\nagnostic. \"There are several interesting lines of thought down here,\" he\r\nsaid wearily, passing his hand over his eyes. I know several men more\r\nenthusiastic over Fleas and Worms than this phlegmatic priest, over\r\nJesus Christ.\r\n\r\n_December_ 20.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I do not spend my days in despair and my nights in\r\nhopeless weeping simply is that I am in love with my own ruin. I\r\ntherefore deserve no sympathy, and probably shan't get it: my own\r\nprofound self-compassion is enough. I am so abominably self-conscious\r\nthat no smallest detail in this tragedy eludes me. Day after day I sit\r\nin the theatre of my own life and watch the drama of my own history\r\nproceeding to its close. Pray God the curtain falls at the right moment\r\nlest the play drag on into some long and tedious anticlimax.\r\n\r\nWe all like to dramatise ourselves. Byron was dramatising himself when,\r\nin a fit of rhetorical self-compassion, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! could I feel as I have felt or be what I have been, Or weep as I\r\ncould once have wept o'er many a vanished scene.\"\r\n\r\nShelley, too, being an artist could not stand insensible to his own\r\ntragedy and Francis Thompson suggests that he even anticipated his own\r\nend from a passage in _Julian and Maddalo_, \"... if you can't swim,\r\nBeware of Providence.\" \"Did no earthly _dixisti_,\" Thompson asks, \"sound\r\nin his ears as he wrote it?\"\r\n\r\nIn any event, it was an admirable ending from the dramatic point of\r\nview; Destiny is often a superb dramatist. What more perfect than the\r\ndeath of Rupert Brooke at Scyros in the Ægean?[6] The lives of some men\r\nare works of art, perfect in form, in development and in climax. Yet how\r\nfrequently a life eminently successful or even eminently ruinous is also\r\nan unlovely, sordid, ridiculous or vulgar affair! Every one will concede\r\nthat it must be a hard thing to be commonplace and vulgar even in\r\nmisfortune, to discover that the tragedy of your own precious life has\r\nbeen dramatically bad, that your life even in its ruins is but a poor\r\nthing, and your own miseries pathetic from their very insignificance;\r\nthat you are only Jones with chronic indigestion rather than Guy de\r\nMaupassant mad, or Coleridge with a great intellect being slowly\r\ndismantled by opium.\r\n\r\nIf only I could order my life by line and level, if I could control or\r\ncreate my own destiny and mould it into some marble perfection! In\r\nshort, if life were an art and not a lottery! In the lives of all of us,\r\nhow many wasted efforts, how many wasted opportunities, false starts,\r\nblind--how many lost days--and man's life is but a paltry three score\r\nyears and ten: pitiful short commons indeed.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as I lean over a five-barred gate or gaze stupidly into the\r\nfire, I garner a bitter-sweet contentment in making ideal\r\nreconstructions of my life, selecting my parents, the date and place of\r\nmy birth, my gifts, my education, my mentors and what portions out of\r\nthe infinity of knowledge shall gain a place within my mind--that sacred\r\nglebe-land to be zealously preserved and enthusiastically cultivated.\r\nWhereas, my mind is now a wilderness in which all kinds of useless\r\ngrowths have found an ineradicable foothold. I am exasperated to find I\r\nhave by heart the long addresses of a lot of dismal business\r\ncorrespondents and yet can't remember the last chapters of Ecclesiastes:\r\nwhat a waste of mind-stuff there! It irks me to be acquainted even to\r\nnausea with the spot in which I live, I whose feet have never traversed\r\neven so much as this little island much less carried me in triumph to\r\nTimbuctoo, Honolulu, Rio, Rome.\r\n\r\n_December_ 21.\r\n\r\nThis continuous preoccupation with self sickens me--as I look back over\r\nthese entries. It is inconceivable that I should be here steadily\r\nwriting up my ego day by day in the middle of this disastrous war....\r\nYesterday I had a move on. To-day life wearies me. I am sick of myself\r\nand life. This beastly world with its beastly war and hate makes me\r\nrestless, dissatisfied, and full of a longing to be quit of it. I am as\r\nfull of unrest as an autumn Swallow. \"My soul,\" I said to them at\r\nbreakfast with a sardonic grin, \"is like a greyhound in the slips. I\r\nshall have to wear heavy boots to prevent myself from soaring. I have\r\nsuch an uplift on me that I could carry a horse, a dog, a cat, if you\r\ntied them on to my homing spirit and so transformed my Ascension into an\r\nadventure out of Baron Munchausen.\" With a gasconnade of contempt, I\r\nshould like to turn on my heel and march straight out of this wretched\r\nworld at once.\r\n\r\n_December_ 22.\r\n\r\n_Gibbon's Autobiography_\r\n\r\nThis book makes me of all people (and especially just now) groan\r\ninwardly. \"I am at a loss,\" he says, referring to the _Decline and\r\nFall_, \"how to describe the success of the work without betraying the\r\nvanity of the writer.... My book was on every table and almost on every\r\ntoilette.\" It makes me bite my lips. Rousseau and his criticism of \"I\r\nsighed as a lover; I obeyed as a son,\" and Gibbon on his dignity in\r\nreply make one of the most ludicrous incidents in literary history. \"...\r\nthat extraordinary man whom I admire and pity, should have been less\r\nprecipitate in condemning the moral character and conduct of a\r\nstranger!\" Oh my giddy Aunt! Isn't this _rich_? Still, I am glad you did\r\nnot marry her: we could ill spare Madam de Staël, Madam Necker's\r\ndaughter, that wonderful, vivacious and warmhearted woman.\r\n\r\n\"After the morning has been occupied with the labours of the library, I\r\nwish to unbend rather than exercise my mind; and in the interval between\r\ntea and supper, I am far from disdaining the innocent amusement of a\r\ngame of cards.\" How Jane Austen would have laughed at him! The passage\r\nreminds me of the Rev. Mr. Collins saying:\r\n\r\n\"Had I been able I should have been only too pleased to give you a song,\r\nfor I regard music as a harmless diversion and perfectly compatible with\r\nthe profession of a clergyman.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I contemplate the common lot of mortality,\" Gibbon writes, \"I must\r\nacknowledge I have drawn a high prize in the lottery of life,\" and he\r\ngoes on to count up all his blessings with the most offensive\r\ndelight--his wealth, the good fortune of his birth, his ripe years, a\r\ncheerful temper, a moderate sensibility, health, sound and peaceful\r\nslumbers from infancy, his valuable friendship with Lord Sheffield, his\r\nrank, fame, etc., etc., _ad nauseam_. He rakes over his whole life for\r\nthings to be grateful for. He intones his happiness in a long recitative\r\nof thanksgiving that his lot was not that of a savage, of a slave, or a\r\npeasant; he washes his hands with imaginary soap on reflecting on the\r\nbounty of Nature which cast his birth in a free and civilised country,\r\nin an age of science and philosophy, in a family of honourable rank and\r\ndecently endowed with the gifts of fortune--sleek, complacent,\r\noleaginous and salacious old gentleman, how I would love to have bombed\r\nyou out of your self-satisfaction!\r\n\r\n_Masefield's \"Gallipoli\"_\r\n\r\nIt amused me to discover the evident relish with which the author of _In\r\nthe Daffodil Fields_ emphasises the blood and the flowers in the attack\r\non Achi Baba. It's all blood and beautiful flowers mixed up together to\r\nMasefield's great excitement.\r\n\r\n     \"A swear word in a city slum\r\n      A simple swear word is to some--\r\n      To Masefield something more.\"\r\n\r\n                              MAX BEERBOHM.\r\n\r\nStill, to call Gallipoli \"bloody Hell\" is, after all, only a\r\npedantically exact description. You understand, tho', a very remarkable\r\nbook--a work of genius.\r\n\r\n_December_ 23.\r\n\r\nTo be cheerful this Xmas would require a _coup de théâtre_--some sort of\r\npsychological sleight of hand.\r\n\r\nI get downstairs at 10 and spend the day reading and writing, without a\r\nsoul to converse with. Everything comes to me second-hand--thro' the\r\nnewspapers, the world of life thro' the halfpenny _Daily News_, and the\r\nworld of books thro' the _Times Literary Supplement_. For the rest I\r\nlisten to the kettle singing and make symphonies out of it, or I look\r\ninto the fire to see the pictures there....\r\n\r\n_December_ 24.\r\n\r\nEveryone I suppose engaged in this irony of Xmas. What a solemn lunatic\r\nthe world is.\r\n\r\nWalked awhile in a beautiful lane close by, washed hard and clean and\r\ndeeply channelled by the recent rain. On the hill-top, I could look\r\nright across the valley to the uplands, where on the sky line a few Firs\r\nstood in stately sequestration from common English Oaks, like a group of\r\nambassadors in full dress. In the distance a hen clucked, I saw a few\r\nPeewits wheeling and watched the smoke rising from our cottage\r\nperpendicularly into the motionless air. There was a clement quiet and a\r\nclement warmth, and in my heart a burst of real happiness that made me\r\nrich even beside less unfortunate beings and beyond what I had ever\r\nexpected to be again.\r\n\r\n_December_ 26.\r\n\r\n\"In thus describing and illustrating my intellectual torpor, I use terms\r\nthat apply more or less to every part of the years during which I was\r\nunder the Circean spells of opium. But for misery--\"\r\n\r\n(Why do I waste my energy with this damned Journal? I stop. I hate it. I\r\nam going out for a walk in the fog.)\r\n\r\n_December_ 31.\r\n\r\n_Reminiscences_\r\n\r\nFor the past few days I have been living in a quiet hermitage of\r\nretrospect. My memories have gone back to the times--remote,\r\ninaccessible, prehistoric--before ever this Journal was begun, when I\r\nmyself was but a jelly without form and void--that is, before I had\r\ndeveloped any characteristic qualities and above all the dominant one, a\r\npassion for Natural History.\r\n\r\nOne day a school friend, being covetous of certain stamps in my\r\ncollection, induced me to \"swop\" them for his collection of birds' eggs\r\nwhich he showed me nestling in the bran at the bottom of a box. He was a\r\ncunning boy and thought he had the better of the bargain. He little\r\nrealised--nor did I--the priceless gift he bestowed when his little fat\r\ndirty hands decorated, I remember, with innumerable warts, picked out\r\nthe eggs and gave them to me. In fact, a smile momentarily crossed his\r\nface, he turned his head aside, he spat in happy contemplation of the\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nI continued eagerly to add to the little collection of Birds' eggs, but\r\nfor a long time it never occurred to me to go out into the country\r\nmyself and collect them,--I just _swopped,_ until one day our errand\r\nboy, who stuttered, had bandy legs, and walked on the outside of his\r\nfeet with the gait of an Anthropoid, said to me, \"I will sh-how you how\r\nto find Birds' n-nests if you like to come out to the w-woods.\" So one\r\nSaturday, when the backyard was cleaned down and the coal boxes filled,\r\nhe and I started off together to a wood some way down the river bank,\r\nwhere he--my good and beneficent angel--presently showed me a Thrush's\r\nnest in the fork of a young Oak tree. Never-to-be-forgotten moment! The\r\nsight of those blue speckled eggs lying so unexpectedly, as I climbed up\r\nthe tree, on the other side of an untidy tangle of dried moss and grass,\r\nin a neat little earthenware cup, caused probably the first tremor of\r\nreal emotion at a beautiful object. The emotion did not last long! In a\r\nmoment I had stolen the eggs and soon after smashed them--in trying to\r\nblow them, schoolboy fashion.\r\n\r\nThen, I rapidly became an ardent field naturalist. My delight in Birds\r\nand Birds' eggs spread in a benignant infection to every branch of\r\nNatural History. I collected Beetles, Butterflies, plants, Birds' wings,\r\nBirds' claws, etc. Dr. Gordon Staples in the _Boy's Own Paper_, taught\r\nme how to make a skin, and I got hold of a Mole and then a Squirrel (the\r\nlatter falling to my prowess with a catapult), stuffed them and set them\r\nup in cases which I glazed myself. I even painted in suitable\r\nbackgrounds, in the one case a mole-hill, looking, I fear, more like a\r\nmountain, and in the other, a Fir tree standing at an impossible angle\r\nof 45°. Then I read a book on trapping, and tried to catch Hares. Then I\r\nread Sir John Lubbock's _Ants, Bees and Wasps_, and constructed an\r\nobservation Ants' nest (though the Ants escaped).\r\n\r\nIn looking back to these days, I am chiefly struck by my extraordinary\r\nignorance of the common objects of the countryside, for although we\r\nlived in the far west country, the house, without a garden, was in the\r\nmiddle of the town, and all my seniors were as ignorant as I. Nature\r\nStudy in the schools did not then exist, I had no benevolent\r\npaterfamilias to take me by the hand and point out the common British\r\nBirds; for my father's only interest was in politics. I can remember\r\ncoming home once all agog with a wonderful Bird I had seen--like a tiny\r\nMagpie, I said. No one could tell me that it was, of course, only a\r\nlittle Pied Wagtail.\r\n\r\nThe absence of sympathy or of congenial companionship, however, had\r\nabsolutely no effect in damping my ardour. As I grew older my\r\negg-collecting companions fell away, some took up the law, or tailoring,\r\nor clerking, some entered the Church, while I became yearly more\r\nengrossed. In my childhood my enthusiasm lay like a watch-spring, coiled\r\nup and hidden inside me, until that Thrush's nest and eggs seized hold\r\nof it by the end and pulled it out by degrees in a long silver ribbon. I\r\nkept live Bats in our upstairs little-used drawing-room, and Newts and\r\nFrogs in pans in the backyard. My mother tolerated these things because\r\nI had sufficiently impressed her with the importance to science of the\r\nobservations which I was making and about to publish. Those on Bats\r\nindeed were thought fit to be included in a standard work\r\n--Barrett-Hamilton's _Mammals of Great Britain and Ireland_. The\r\npublished articles served to bring me into correspondence with other\r\nnaturalists, and I shall never forget my excitement on receiving for the\r\nfirst time a letter of appreciation. It was from the author of several\r\nnatural history books, to\r\n\r\n               \"W.N.P. BARBELLION, ESQ.,\r\n                  Naturalist,\r\n                           Downstable,\"\r\n\r\nand illustrated with a delightful sketch of Ring Plovers feeding on the\r\nsaltings. This letter was carefully pasted into my diary, where it still\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it is perhaps unfair to say that I had no kindred spirit with\r\nme in my investigations. Martha, the servant girl who had been with us\r\nfor 30 years, loved animals of all sorts and--what was strange in a\r\ncountry girl--she had no fear of handling even such things as Newts and\r\nFrogs. My Batrachia often used to escape from their pans in the yard\r\ninto Martha's kitchen, and, not a bit scandalised, she would sometimes\r\ncatch one marching across the rug or squeezing underneath a cupboard.\r\n\"Lor'!\" would be her comment as she picked the vagrant up and took it\r\nback to its aquarium, \"can't 'em travel?\" Martha had an eye for\r\ncharacter in animals. In the long dynasty of cats we possessed one at\r\nlength who by association of opposite ideas we called Marmaduke because\r\nhe ought to have been called Jan Stewer. \"A chuff old feller, 'idden\r\n'ee?\" Martha used to ask me with pride and love in her eyes. \"He purrs\r\nin broad Devon,\" I used to answer. Marmaduke need only wave the tip of\r\nhis tail to indicate to her his imperative desire to promenade. Martha\r\nknew if no one else did that every spring \"Pore 'Duke,\" underneath his\r\nfur, used to come out in spots. \"'Tiz jus' like a cheel 'e gets a bit\r\nspotty as the warm weather cums along.\" Starlings on the washhouse roof,\r\nregularly fed with scraps, were ever her wonder and delight. \"Don' 'em\r\nlet it down, I zay?\" In later years, when I was occupied in the top\r\nattic, making dissections of various animals that I collected, she would\r\nsometimes leave her scrubbing and cleaning in the room below to thrust\r\nher head up the attic stairs and enquire, \"'Ow be 'ee gettin' on then?\"\r\nHer unfeigned interest in my anatomical researches gave me real\r\npleasure, and I took delight in arousing her wonder by pointing out and\r\nexplaining the brain of a Pigeon or the nervous system of a Dog-fish, or\r\na Frog's heart taken out and still beating in the dissecting dish. She,\r\nin reply, would add reflections upon her own experiences in preparing\r\nmeat for dinner--anecdotes about the \"maw\" of an old Fowl, or the great\r\n\"pipe\" of a Goose. Then, suddenly scurrying downstairs, she would say,\r\n\"I must be off or I shall be all be'ind like the cow's tail.\" Now the\r\ndignified interest of the average educated man would have chilled me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, years later, when he was a miner in S. Wales, that historic\r\nerrand-boy displayed his consciousness of the important role he once\r\nplayed by sending me on a postcard congratulations on my success in the\r\nB.M. appointment. It touched me to think he had not forgotten after\r\nyears of separation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] So it proved. See September 26 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2] In \"La Recherche de l'Absolu\" (Balzac).\r\n\r\n[3] See September 3 (next entry), \"_A Jolt_,\" and September 24\r\n(_infra_).\r\n\r\n[4] The handwriting is painfully laboured, very large across a page and\r\nso crooked as to be almost undecipherable in places.\r\n\r\n[5] This is from a letter written by the dying Keats in Naples to his\r\nfriend Brown.\r\n\r\n[6] Contrast with it Wordsworth rotting at Rydal Mount or Swinburne at\r\nPutney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1917\r\n\r\n\r\n_January_ 1.\r\n\r\nThe New Year came in like a thief in the night--noiselessly; no bells,\r\nno syrens, no songs by order of the Government. Nothing could have been\r\nmore appropriate than a burglarious entry like this--seeing what the\r\nyear has come to filch from us all in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n_January_ 20.\r\n\r\nI am over 6 feet high and as thin as a skeleton; every bone in my body,\r\neven the neck vertebrae, creak at odd intervals when I move. So that I\r\nam not only a skeleton but a badly articulated one to boot. If to this\r\nis coupled the fact of the creeping paralysis, you have the complete\r\nhorror. Even as I sit and write, millions of bacteria are gnawing away\r\nmy precious spinal cord, and if you put your ear to my back the sound of\r\nthe gnawing I dare say could be heard. The other day a man came and set\r\nup a post in the garden for the clothes' line. As soon as I saw the post\r\nI said \"gibbet\"--it looks exactly like one, and I, for sure, must be the\r\nmalefactor. Last night while E---- was nursing the baby I most\r\ndelightfully remarked: \"What a little parasite--why you are Cleopatra\r\naffixing the aspic--'Tarry, good lady, the bright day is done, and we\r\nare for the dark.'\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that such images arise spontaneously in my mind, show how\r\nrotten to the core I am.\r\n\r\n... The advent of the Baby was my _coup de grâce._ The little creature\r\nseems to focus under one head all my personal disasters and more than\r\nonce a senseless rage has clutched me at the thought of a baby in\r\nexchange for my ambition, a nursery for the study. Yet, on the whole, I\r\nfind it a good and satisfying thing to see her, healthy, new, intact on\r\nthe threshold: I grow tired of my own dismal life just as one does of a\r\nsuit of dirty clothes. My life and person are patched and greasy; hers\r\nis new and without a single blemish or misfortune.... Moreover, she\r\nmakes her mother happy and consoles her grandmother too.\r\n\r\n_January_ 21.\r\n\r\n_Death_\r\n\r\nWhat a delightful thing the state of Death would be if the dead passed\r\ntheir time haunting the places they loved in life and living over again\r\nthe dear delightful past--if death were one long indulgence in the\r\npleasures of memory! if the disembodied spirit forgot all the pains of\r\nits previous existence and remembered only the happiness! Think of me\r\nflitting about the orchards and farm-yards in ---- birdsnesting, walking\r\nalong the coast among the seabirds, climbing Exmoor, bathing in streams\r\nand in the sea, haunting all my old loves and passions, cutting open\r\nwith devouring curiosity Rabbits, Pigeons, Frogs, Dogfish, Amphioxus;\r\nthink of me, too, at length unwillingly deflected from these cherished\r\npursuits in the raptures of first love, cutting her initials on trees\r\nand fences instead of watching birds, day-dreaming over _Parker and\r\nHaswell_ and then bitterly reproaching myself later for much loss of\r\nprecious time. How happy I shall be if Death is like this: to be living\r\nover again and again all my ecstasies, over first times--the first time\r\nI found a Bottle Tit's nest, the first time I succeeded in penetrating\r\ninto the fastnesses of my El Dorado--Exmoor, the first time I gazed upon\r\nthe internal anatomy of a Snail, the first time I read Berkeley's\r\n_Principles of Human Understanding_ (what a soul-shaking epoch that\r\nwas!), and the first time I kissed her! My hope is that I may haunt\r\nthese times again, that I may haunt the places, the books, the bathes,\r\nthe walks, the desires, the hopes, the first (and last) loves of my life\r\nall transfigured and beatified by sovereign Memory.\r\n\r\n_January_ 26.\r\n\r\nOut of doors to-day it's like the roaring forties! Every tree I passed\r\nin the lane was a great wind instrument, bellowing out a passionate\r\nsong, and the sky was torn to ribbons. It is cold enough to freeze the\r\nnose off a brass Monkey, but very exhilarating. I stood on the hill and\r\nsquared my fists to the wind and bade everything come on. I sit writing\r\nthis by the fire and am thoroughly scourged and purified by this great\r\ncastigating wind.... I think I will stick it out--I will sit quite still\r\nin my chair and defy this sculking footpad--let the paralysis creep into\r\nevery bone, I will hang on to the last and watch it skulking with my\r\nmost hideous grimace.\r\n\r\n_January_ 27.\r\n\r\nStill freezing and blowing. Coming back from the village, tho' I was\r\ntired and hobbling badly, decided to walk up the lane even if it meant\r\ncrawling home on hands and knees.\r\n\r\nThe sky was a quick-change artist to-day. Every time you looked you saw\r\na different picture. From the bottom of the hill I looked up and saw\r\nabove me--it seemed at an immense and windy height--a piece of blue,\r\nframed in an irregular edge of white woolly cloud seen thro' the crooked\r\nbranches of an Oak. It was a narrow crooked lane, sunk deep in the soil\r\nwith large smooth surfaces of stone like skulls bulging up in places\r\nwhere the rain had washed away the soil.\r\n\r\nFurther on, the sun was lying low almost in the centre of a\r\nsemi-circular bend in the near horizon. It frosted the wool of a few\r\nsheep seen in silhouette, and then slowly disappeared in mist. On the\r\nright-hand side was a cottage with the smoke being wrenched away from\r\nthe chimney top, and on the left a group of stately Firs, chanting a\r\nrequiem like a cathedral choir.\r\n\r\n_January_ 28.\r\n\r\nStill blowing and bitterly cold. Along the path fields in the Park I\r\nstopped to look at a thick clump of Firs standing aloof on some high\r\nground and guarded by an outside ring of honest English Oaks, Ashes and\r\nElms. They were a sombre mysterious little crowd intent, I fancied, on\r\nsome secret ritual of the trees. The high ground on which they stood\r\nlooked higher and more inaccessible than it really was, the clump was\r\ndark green, almost black, and in between their trunks where all was\r\nobscurity, some hardy adventurer might well have discovered a Grand Lama\r\nsitting within his Penetralia. But I had no taste for any such\r\nprofanity, and even as I looked the sun came out from behind a cloud\r\nvery slowly, bringing the picture into clearer focus, chasing away\r\nshadows and bringing out all the colours. The landscape resumed its\r\nhomely aspect: an English park with Firs in it.\r\n\r\n_January_ 29.\r\n\r\nLast night, I pulled aside the window curtain of our front door and\r\npeeped out. Just below the densely black projecting gable of the house I\r\nsaw the crescent moon lying on her back in a bed of purple sky, and I\r\nsaw our little white frosted garden path curving up towards the garden\r\ngate. It was a delicious _coup d'œil_, and I shewed it to E----.\r\n\r\n_January_ 31.\r\n\r\nShowers of snow at intervals, the little flakes rocking about lazily or\r\nspiralling down, while the few that eventually reached the ground would\r\nin a moment or so be caught up in a sudden furious puff of wind, and\r\nsent driving along the road with the dust.\r\n\r\nMy usual little jaunt up the lane past the mossy farm-house. Home to\r\ntoasted tea-cakes and a pinewood fire, with my wife chattering prettily\r\nto the baby. After tea, enchanted by the reading of a new book--_Le\r\nJournal de Maurice de Guérin_--or rather the introduction to it by\r\nSainte-Beuve. I devoured it! I have spent a devouring day; under a calm\r\nexterior I have burnt up the hours; all of me has been athrob; every\r\nlittle cell in my brain has danced to its own little tune. For to-day,\r\nDeath has been an impossibility. I have felt that anyhow to-day I could\r\nnot die--I have laughed at the mere thought of it. If only this mood\r\nwould last! If I could feel thus always, then I could fend off Death for\r\nan immortality of life.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, as now, the real horror of my life and future comes on me\r\nin a flash. For a second I am terrified by the menace of the future, but\r\nfortunately only for a second. For I've learnt a trick which I fear to\r\nreveal; it is so valuable and necessary to me that if I talked of it or\r\nvulgarised it my secret might be stolen away. Not a word then!\r\n\r\n_Later_. I have just heard on the gramophone, some Grieg, and it has\r\ncharged my happiness with disrupting voltage of desire. Oh! if only I\r\nhad health, I could make the welkin ring! I shall leave so little behind\r\nme, such a few paltry pages beside what I have it in me to do. It\r\nshatters me.\r\n\r\n_February_ 1.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I must say I like the splendid gusto with which I lived\r\nthro' yesterday: that mettlesome fashion in which I took the lane, and\r\nat the top, how I swung around to sweep my gaze across to the uplands\r\nopposite with snow falling all the time. Then in the evening, the almost\r\ncomplete absorption in the new book when I forgot everything _pro tem_.\r\nIt was quite like the old days.\r\n\r\n_February_ 2.\r\n\r\n_Crowd Fever_\r\n\r\nAfter four months' sick leave, returned to work and London.\r\n\r\nAn illness like mine rejuvenates one--for the time being! A pony and\r\njingle from the old \"Fox and Hounds Inn\" took me to the Station, and I\r\nenjoyed the feel of the wheels rolling beneath me over the hard road. In\r\nthe train, I looked out of the window as interested as any schoolboy. On\r\nthe Underground I was delighted with the smooth, quiet way with which\r\nthe \"Metro\" trains glide into the Station. I had quite forgotten this.\r\nThen, when my hand began to get better, I rediscovered the pleasures of\r\npenmanship and kept on writing, with my tongue out. And I re-enjoyed the\r\nchild's satisfaction in coaxing a button to slip into its hole: all\r\ngrown-up people have forgotten how difficult and complex such operations\r\nare.\r\n\r\nThis morning how desirable everything seemed to me! The world\r\nintoxicated me. Moving again among so many human beings gave me the\r\ncrowd-fever, and started again all the pangs of the old familiar hunger\r\nfor a fuller life, that centrifugal elan in which I feared for the\r\ndisruption and scattering of my parts in all directions. Temporarily I\r\nlost the hegemony of my own soul. Every man and woman I met was my\r\nenemy, threatening me with the secession of some inward part. I was\r\nalarmed to discover how many women I could passionately love and with\r\nhow many men I could form a lasting friendship. Within, all was anarchy\r\nand commotion, a cold fright seized me lest some extraordinary event was\r\nabout to happen: some general histolysis of my body, some sudden\r\ndisintegration of my personality, some madness, some strange death....\r\nI wanted to crush out the life of all these men and women in a great\r\nBear's hug, my God! this sea of human faces whom I can never recognise,\r\nall of us alive together beneath this yellow catafalque of fog on the\r\nmorning of the announcement of world famine and world war!...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo-night, I have lost this paroxysm. For I am home again by the\r\nfireside. All the multitude have disappeared from my view. I have lost\r\nthem, every one. I have lost another day of my life and so have they,\r\nand we have lost each other. Meanwhile the great world spins on\r\nunrelentingly, frittering away lightly my precious hours (surely a small\r\nstock now?) while I sit discomfited by the evening fire and nurse my\r\nscraped hands that tingle because the spinning world has wrenched itself\r\nout of my feeble grasp.\r\n\r\n_February_ 3.\r\n\r\nThis morning on arriving at S. Kensington, went straight to a Chemist's\r\nshop, but finding someone inside, I drew back, and went on to another.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any morphia tabloids?\" I asked a curly-haired, nice-looking,\r\nsmiling youth, who leaned with both hands on the counter and looked at\r\nme knowingly, as if he had had unlimited experience of would-be morphi\r\nnomaniacs.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, plenty of them,\" he said, fencing. And then waited.\r\n\r\n\"Can you supply me?\" I asked, feeling very conscious of myself.\r\n\r\nHe smiled once more, shook his head and said it was contrary to the\r\nDefence of the Realm Act.\r\n\r\nI made a sorry effort to appear ingenuous, and he said:\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it is only a palliative.\"\r\n\r\nWith a solemn countenance intended to indicate pain I answered:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but palliatives are very necessary sometimes,\" and I walked out of\r\nthe hateful shop discomfited.\r\n\r\n_February_ 6.\r\n\r\nAm busy re-writing,[1] editing and bowdlerising my journals for\r\npublication against the time when I shall have gone the way of all\r\nflesh. No one else would prepare it for publication if I don't. Reading\r\nit through again, I see what a remarkable book I have written. If only\r\nthey will publish it!\r\n\r\n_February_ 7.\r\n\r\n_Chinese Lanterns_\r\n\r\nThe other morning as I dressed, I could see the sun like a large yellow\r\nmoon rising on a world, stiff, stark, its contours merely indicated\r\nbeneath a winding-sheet of snow. Further around the horizon was another\r\nmoon--the full moon itself--yellow likewise, but setting. It was the\r\nstrangest picture I ever saw. I might well have been upon another\r\nplanet; I could not have been more surprised even at a whole ring of\r\nyellow satellites arranged at regular intervals all around the horizon.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day, I drove home from the Station in a\r\nlittle governess-cart, over a snow-clogged road. The cautious little\r\npony picked out her way so carefully in little\r\nstrides--pat-pat-pat--wherever it was slippery, and the Landlord of the\r\nInn sat opposite me extolling all the clever little creature's merits.\r\nIt was dusk, and for some reason of the atmosphere the scraps of cloud\r\nappeared as blue sky and the blue sky as cloud, beneath which the full\r\nmoon like a great Chinese lantern hung suspended so low down it seemed\r\nto touch the trees and hills. How have folk been able to \"carry on\" in a\r\nworld so utterly strange as this one during the past few days! I marvel\r\nthat beneath such moons and suns, the peoples of the world have not\r\nceased for a while from the petty business of war during at least a few\r\nof our dancing revolutions around this furnace of a star. One of these\r\ndays I should not be surprised if this fascinated earth did not fall\r\ninto it like a moth into a candle. And where would our Great War be\r\nthen?\r\n\r\n_February_ 28.\r\n\r\n_The Strangeness of my Life_\r\n\r\nConsider the War: and the current adventures of millions of men on land,\r\nsea and air; and the incessant labours of millions of men in factory and\r\nworkshop and in the field; think of the hospitals and all they hold, of\r\neveryone hoping, fearing, suffering, waiting--of the concentration of\r\nall humanity on the one subject--the War. And then think of me, poor\r\nlittle me, deserted and forgotten, a tiny fragment sunk so deep and\r\nhelplessly between the sheer granite walls of my environment that scarce\r\nan echo reaches me of the thunder among the mountains above. I read\r\nabout the War in a ha'penny paper, and see it in the pictures of the\r\n_Daily Mirror_. For the rest, I live by counting the joints on insects'\r\nlegs and even that much effort is almost beyond my strength.\r\n\r\nThat is strange enough. But my life is stranger still by comparison. And\r\nthis is the marvel: that every day I spend by the waters of Babylon,\r\nweeping and neglected among enthusiasts, enthusiastically counting\r\njoints, while every evening I return to Zion to my books, to Hardy's\r\npoems, to Maurice de Guérin's Journals, to my own memoirs. Mine is a\r\nlife of consummate isolation, and I frequently marvel at it.\r\n\r\nThe men I meet accept me as an entomologist and _ipso facto_, an\r\nenthusiast in the science. That is all they know of me, and all they\r\nwant to know of me, or of any man. Surely no man's existence was ever\r\nquite such a duplicity as mine. I smile bitterly to myself ten times a\r\nday, as I engage in all the dreary technical jargon of professional talk\r\nwith them. How they would gossip over the facts of my life if they knew!\r\nHow scandalised they would be over my inner life's activities, how\r\nresentful of enthusiasm other than entomological!\r\n\r\nI find it very irksome to keep up this farce of concealment. I would\r\nlove to declare myself. I loathe, hate and detest the secrecy of my real\r\nself: the continuous restraint enforced on me ulcerates my heart and\r\nmakes harmonious social existence impossible with those who do not know\r\nme thoroughly. \"On dit qu'au jugement dernier le secret des consciences\r\nsera révélé à tout l'univers; je voudrais qu'il en fut ainsi de moi dès\r\naujourd'hui et que la vue de mon âme fut ouvert à tous venants.\" Maurice\r\nde Guérin.\r\n\r\n_March_ 1.\r\n\r\nIt is curious for me to look at my tubes and microscope and realise that\r\nI shall never require them again for serious use. Life is a dreadful\r\nburden to me at the Museum. I am too ill for any scientific work so I\r\nwrite labels and put things away. I am simply marking time on the edge\r\nof a precipice awaiting the order, \"Forward.\"\r\n\r\nIt is excoriating to be thus wasting the last few precious days of my\r\nlife in such mummery merely to get bread to eat. They might at least let\r\nme die in peace, and with fitting decorum. It is so ignoble to be\r\ntinkering about in a Museum among Scarabees and insects when I ought to\r\nbe reflecting on life and death.\r\n\r\nI ask myself what ought to be my most appropriate reaction in such\r\ncircumstances as the present? Why, of course, to carry on as if all were\r\nnormal, and the future unknown: why, so I do, to outward view, for the\r\nsake of the others. Yet that is no reason why in my own inward parts I\r\nshould not at times indulge in a little relaxation. It is a relief to\r\nput off the mailed coat, to sit awhile by the green-room fire and have\r\nlife as it really is, all to myself. But the necessity of living will\r\nnot let me alone. I must be always mumming.\r\n\r\nMy life has been all isolation and restriction. And it now appears even\r\nmy death is to be hedged around with prohibitions. Drugs for\r\nexample--how beneficent a little laudanum at times in a case like mine!\r\nand how happy I could be if I knew that in my waistcoat pocket I carried\r\na kindly, easy means of shuffling off this coil when the time comes as\r\ncome it must. It horrifies me to consider how I might break the life of\r\nE---- clean in two, and sap her courage by a lingering, dawdling dying.\r\nBut there is the Defence of the Realm Act. It is a case of a Scorpion in\r\na ring of fire but without any sting in its tail.\r\n\r\n_March_ 2.\r\n\r\nI ask myself: what are my views on death, the next world, God? I look\r\ninto my mind and discover I am too much of a mannikin to have any. As\r\nfor death, I am a little bit of trembling jelly of anticipation. I am\r\nprepared for anything, but I am the complete agnostic; I simply don't\r\nknow. To have views, faith, beliefs, one needs a backbone. This great\r\nbully of a universe overwhelms me. The stars make me cower. I am\r\nintimidated by the immensity surrounding my own littleness. It is futile\r\nand presumptuous for me to opine anything about the next world. But I\r\n_hope_ for something much freer and more satisfying after death, for\r\nemancipation of the spirit and above all for the obliteration of this\r\npuny self, this little, skulking, sharp-witted ferret.\r\n\r\n_A Potted Novel_\r\n\r\n(1)\r\n\r\nHe was an imaginative youth, and she a tragedy queen. So he fell in love\r\nwith her because she was melancholy and her past tragic. \"She is\r\n_capable_ of tragedy, too,\" he said, which was a high encomium.\r\n\r\nBut he was also an ambitious youth and all for dalliance in love.\r\n\"Marriage,\" said he sententiously, \"is an economic trap.\" And then, a\r\nlittle wistfully: \"If she were a bit more melancholy and a bit more\r\nbeautiful she would be quite irresistible.\"\r\n\r\n(2)\r\n\r\nBut he was a miserable youth, too, and in the anguish of loneliness and\r\nlovelessness a home tempted him sorely. Still, he dallied. _She_ waited.\r\nIll-health after all made marriage impossible.\r\n\r\n(3)\r\n\r\nYet love and misery drove him towards it. So one day he closed his eyes\r\nand offered himself up with sacrificial hands.... \"Too late,\" she said.\r\n\"Once perhaps ... but now....\" His eyes opened again, and in a second\r\nLove entered his Temple once more and finally ejected the money\r\nchangers.\r\n\r\n(4)\r\n\r\nSo they married after all, and he was under the impression she had made\r\na good match. He had ill-health perhaps, yet who could doubt his\r\nultimate fame?\r\n\r\nThen the War came, and he had the hardihood to open a sealed letter from\r\nhis Doctor to the M.O. examining recruits.... Stars and staggers!! So\r\nit was she who was the victim in marriage! That harassing question: Did\r\nshe know? What an ass he had been all through, what superlative egoism\r\nand superlative conceit!\r\n\r\n(5)\r\n\r\nThen a baby came. He broke under the strain and daily the symptoms grew\r\nmore obvious. Did she know?... The question dazed him.\r\n\r\nWell, she _did_ know, and had married him for love, nevertheless,\r\nagainst every friendly counsel, the Doctor's included.\r\n\r\n(6)\r\n\r\nAnd now the invalid's gratitude is almost cringeing, his admiration\r\nboundless and his love for always. It is the perfect _rapprochement_\r\nbetween two souls, one that was honeycombed with self-love and lost in\r\nthe labyrinthine ways of his own motives and the other straight, direct,\r\nalmost imperious in love and altogether adorable.\r\n\r\n_Finis_\r\n\r\n_March_ 5.\r\n\r\nAt home ill again. Yesterday was a day of utter dreariness. All my\r\nnerves were frozen, my heart congealed. I had no love for anyone ... no\r\nemotion of any sort. It was a catalepsy of the spirit harder to bear\r\nthan fever or pain.... To-day, life is once more stirring in me, I am\r\nslowly awaking to the consciousness of acute but almost welcome misery.\r\n\r\n_March_ 6.\r\n\r\nAn affectionate letter from H---- that warmed the cockles of my\r\nheart--poor frozen molluscs. A---- has written only once since August.\r\n\r\n_March_ 7.\r\n\r\nI am, I suppose, a whey-faced, lily-livered creature ... yet even an\r\ninfantry subaltern has a chance....\r\n\r\nMy dear friend ---- has died and a _Memorial_ Exhibition of his pictures\r\nis being held at the Goupil Gallery. The most fascinating man I ever\r\nmet. I was attracted by him almost as one is attracted by a charming\r\nwoman: by little ways, by laughing eyes, by the manner of speech. And\r\nnow he is dead, of a lingering and painful disease.\r\n\r\n_March_ 8.\r\n\r\n_Death_\r\n\r\nHave been reading Sir Oliver Lodge's _Raymond_. I do not deny that I am\r\ncurious about the next world, or about the condition of death. I am and\r\nalways have been. In my early youth, I reflected continually on death\r\nand hated it bitterly. But now that my end is near and certain, I\r\nconsider it less and am content to wait and see. As, for all practical\r\npurposes, I have done with life, and my own existence is often a burden\r\nto me and is like to become a burden also to others, I wish I possessed\r\nthe wherewithal to end it at my will. With two or three tabloids in my\r\nwaistcoat pocket, and my secret locked in my heart, how serenely I would\r\nmove about among my friends and fellows, conscious that at some\r\nspecially selected moment--at midnight or high noon--just when the\r\nspirit moved me, I could quietly slip out to sea on this Great\r\nAdventure. It would be well to be able to control this: the time, the\r\nplace, and the manner of one's exit. For what disturbs me in particular\r\nis how I shall conduct myself; I am afraid lest I become afraid, it is a\r\nfear of fear. By means of my tabloids, I could arrange my death in an\r\nartistic setting, say underneath a big tree on a summer's day, with an\r\nopen Homer in my hand, or more appropriately, a magnifying glass and\r\nMiall and Denny's _Cockroach._ It would be stage-managing my own demise\r\nand surely the last thing in self-conscious elegance!\r\n\r\nI think it was De Quincey who said Death to him seemed most awful in the\r\nsummer. On the contrary the earth is warm then, and would welcome my old\r\nbones. It is on a cold night by the winter fire that the churchyard\r\nseems to me the least inviting: especially horrible it is the first\r\nevening after the funeral.\r\n\r\n_March_ 10.\r\n\r\nHave had a relapse. My hand I fear is going. Food prices are leaping up.\r\nWoe to the unfit and the old and the poor in these coming days! We shall\r\nsoon have nothing left in our pantries, and a piece of Wrigley's chewing\r\ngum will be our only comfort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I come to quit this world I scarcely know which will be the greater\r\nregret: the people I have never met, or the places I have never seen. In\r\nthe world of books, I rest fairly content: I have read my fair share.\r\n\r\nTo-day I read down the column of to-morrow's preachers with the most\r\nludicrous avidity, ticking off the Churches I have visited: St. Paul's\r\nand the Abbey, the Ethical Church in Bayswater and Westminster\r\nCathedral. But the Unitarians, the Christadelphians, the Theosophists,\r\nthe Church of Christ Scientist, the Buddhist Society, the Brompton\r\nOratory, the Church of Humanity, the New Life Centre; all these\r\nadventures I intended one day to make.... It is not much fun ticking off\r\nthings you have done from a list if you have done very little. I get\r\nmore satisfaction out of a list of books. But Iona and the Hebrides,\r\nEdinburgh, Brussels, Buenos Ayres, Spitzbergen (when the flowers are\r\nout), the Niagara Falls (by moonlight), the Grindelwald, Cairo--these\r\nnames make me growl and occasionally yelp like a hurt puppy, although to\r\noutward view I am sitting in an armchair blowing smoke-rings.\r\n\r\n_March_ 11.\r\n\r\n_The Graph of Temperament_\r\n\r\nIn this Journal, my pen is a delicate needle point, tracing out a graph\r\nof temperament so as to show its daily fluctuations: grave and gay, up\r\nand down, lamentation and revelry, self-love and self-disgust. You get\r\nhere all my thoughts and opinions, always irresponsible and often\r\ncontradictory or mutually exclusive, all my moods and vapours, all the\r\nvarying reactions to environment of this jelly which is I. I snap at\r\nany idea that comes floating down, particularly if it is gaudy or\r\nquixotic, no matter if it is wholly incompatible with what I said the\r\nday before. People unpleasantly refer me back, and to escape I have to\r\ninvent some sophistry. I unconsciously imitate the mannerisms of folk I\r\nam particularly taken with. Other people never fail to tell me of my\r\nsimulations. If I read a book and like it very much, by a process of\r\npeaceful penetration, the author takes possession of my whole\r\npersonality just as if I were a medium giving a sitting, and for some\r\ntime subsequently his ideas come spurting up like a fountain making a\r\npretty display which I take to be my own. Other people say of me, \"Oh! I\r\nexpect he read it in a book.\"\r\n\r\nI am something between a Monkey, a Chameleon, and a Jellyfish. To any\r\nbully with an intellect like a blunderbuss, I have always timidly held\r\nup my hands and afterwards gnashed my teeth for my cowardice. In\r\nconversation with men of alien sentiment I am self-effacing to my\r\nintense chagrin, often from mere shyness. I say, \"Yes ... yes ... yes,\"\r\nto nausea, when it ought to be \"No ... no ... no.\" I become my own\r\nrenegade, an amiable dissembler, an ass in short. It is a torture to\r\nhave a sprightly mind blanketed by personal timidity and a feeble\r\npresence. The humiliating thing is that almost any strong character\r\nhynotises me into complacency, especially if he is a stranger; I find\r\nmyself for the time being in really sincere agreement with him, and only\r\nlater, discover to myself his abominable doctrines. Then I lie in bed\r\nand have imaginary conversations in which I get my own back.\r\n\r\nBut, by Jove, I wreak vengeance on my familiars, and on those brethren\r\neven weaker than myself. They get my concentrated gall, my sulphurous\r\nfulminations, and would wonder to read this confession.\r\n\r\n_Cynicism_\r\n\r\nFor an unusually long time after I grew up, I maintained a beautiful\r\nconfidence in the goodness of mankind. Rumours did reach me, but I\r\nbrushed them aside as slanders. I was an ingénu, unsuspecting,\r\ncredulous. I thoroughly believed that men and women and I were much\r\nbetter than we actually are. I have not come to the end of my\r\ndisillusions even now. I still rub my eyes on occasion. I simply can't\r\nbelieve that we are such humbugs, hypocrites, self-deceivers. And\r\nstrange to say it is the \"good\" people above all who most bitterly\r\ndisappoint me. Give me a healthy liar, or a thief, or a vagabond, and he\r\narouses no expectations, and so I get no heart-burning. It is the good,\r\nthe honest, the true, who cheat me of my boyhood's beliefs.... I am a\r\ncynic then, but not a reckless cynic--a careworn unhappy cynic without\r\nthe cynic's pride. \"It is easy to be cynical,\" someone admonished me.\r\n\"Unfortunately it is,\" I said.\r\n\r\nWe are so cold, so aloof, so self-centred even the warmest friends. Men\r\nof piety love God, but their love for each other is so commonly but a\r\npoor thing. My own affections are always frosted over with the\r\nEnglishman's reserve. I hesitate as if I were not sure of them. I am\r\nafraid of self-deception, I hate to find out either myself or others.\r\nAnd yet I am always doing so. Mine is a restlessly analytical brain. I\r\ndissect everyone, even those I love, and my discoveries frequently sting\r\nme to the quick. \"To the pure all things are pure,\" whence I should\r\nconclude I suppose that it is the beam in my own eye. But I would not\r\ntolerate being deceived concerning either my own beam or other people's\r\nmotes.\r\n\r\n_March_ 12.\r\n\r\n_Archæopteryx and Mudflats_\r\n\r\nYesterday I collected two distinct and several twinges and hereby save\r\nthem up. They were more than that--they were pangs, and pangs that\r\ntwanged.\r\n\r\n(Why do I make fun of my suffering?)\r\n\r\nOne was when I saw the well-known figure of the _Archæopteryx_ remains\r\nin the slab of Lithographic sandstone of Bavaria: a reproduction in an\r\nillustrated encyclopædia. The other was when someone mentioned mud, and\r\nI thought of the wide estuary of the T----, its stretches of mudflats\r\nand its wild-fowl. We were turning over some pages and she said:\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Archæopteryx_,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is _Archæopteryx_?\"\r\n\r\n\"An extinct bird,\" I answered mournfully.\r\n\r\nLike an old amour, my love of palæontology and anatomy, and all the high\r\nhopes I entertained of them, came smarting to life again, so I turned\r\nover the page quickly.\r\n\r\nBut why need I explain to you, O my Journal? To others, I could not\r\nexplain. I was tongue-tied.\r\n\r\n\"I used to get very muddy,\" I remarked lamentably, \"in the old days when\r\nstalking birds on the mudflats.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they rather jeered at such an occupation in such a place, just as\r\nthose beautiful sights and sounds of zostera-covered mud-banks,\r\ntwinkling runnels, swiftly running thin-legged waders, their whistles\r\nand cries began to steal over my memory like a delicate pain.\r\n\r\nTo my infinite regret, I have no description, no photograph or sketch,\r\nno token of any sort to remember them by. And their doom is certain.\r\nHeavens! how I wasted my impressions and experiences then! Swinburne has\r\nsome lines about saltings which console me a little, but I know of no\r\nother descriptions by either pen or brush.\r\n\r\n_March_ 15.\r\n\r\nHow revolting it is to see some barren old woman love-sick over a baby,\r\nbestowing voluptuous kisses on its nose, eyes, hands, feet, utterly\r\nintoxicated and chattering incessantly in the \"little language,\" and\r\nhopping about like an infatuated cock grouse.\r\n\r\n_May_ 5.\r\n\r\nThe nurse has been here now for over five weeks. One day has been pretty\r\nmuch the same as another. I get out of bed usually about tea-time and\r\nsit by the window and churn over past, present, and future. However, the\r\nSwallows have arrived at last, though they were very late, and there\r\nare also Cuckoos, Green Wood-peckers, Moorhens, calling from across the\r\npark. At night, when the moon is up, I get a great deal of fun out of an\r\nextremely self-inflated Brown Owl, who hoots up through the breadth and\r\nlength of the valley, and then I am sure, listens with satisfaction to\r\nhis echo. Still, I have much sympathy with that Brown Owl and his\r\nhooting.\r\n\r\nWhat I do (goodness knows what E---- does), is to drug my mind with\r\nprint. I am just a rag-bag of Smollett, H.G. Wells, Samuel Butler, the\r\n_Daily News_, the Bible, the _Labour Leader, Joseph Vance_, etc., etc.\r\nExcept for an occasional geyser of malediction when some particularly\r\nacrid memory comes uppermost in my mind, I find myself submitting with a\r\nsurprising calm and even cheerfulness. That agony of frustration which\r\ngnawed my vitals so much in 1913 has disappeared, and I, who expected to\r\ngo down in the smoke and sulphur of my own fulminations, am quite as\r\nlikely to fold my hands across my chest with a truly Christian\r\nresignation. Joubert said, \"Patience and misfortune, courage and death,\r\nresignation and the inevitable, generally come together. Indifference to\r\nlife generally arises with the impossibility of preserving it\"--how\r\ncynical that sounds.\r\n\r\n_May_ 8.\r\n\r\nThis and another volume of my Journal are temporarily lodged in a drawer\r\nin my bedroom. It appears to me that as I become more static and\r\nmoribund, they become more active and aggressive. All day they make a\r\nperfect uproar in their solitary confinement--although no one hears it.\r\nAnd at night they become phosphorescent, though nobody sees it. One of\r\nthese days, with continued neglect they will blow up from spontaneous\r\ncombustion like diseased gunpowder, the dismembered diarist being thus\r\nhoist upon his own petard.\r\n\r\n_June_ 1.\r\n\r\nWe discuss post mortem affairs quite genially and without restraint. It\r\nis the contempt bred of familiarity I suppose. E---- says widows' weeds\r\nhave been so vulgarised by the war widows that she won't go into deep\r\nmourning. \"But you'll wear just one weed or two for me?\" I plead, and\r\nthen we laugh. She has promised me that should a suitable chance arise,\r\nshe will marry again. Personally, I wish I could place my hand on the\r\nyoung fellow at once, so as to put him thro' his paces--shew him where\r\nthe water main runs and where the gas meter is, and so on.\r\n\r\nYou will observe what a relish I have for my own _macabre_, and how\r\nkeenly I appreciate the present situation. Nobody can say I am not\r\nmaking the best of it. One might call it pulling the hangman's beard.\r\nYet I ought, I fancy, to be bewailing my poor wife and fatherless child.\r\n\r\n_June_ 15.\r\n\r\nI sit all day in my chair, moving 8 feet to my bed at night, and 8 feet\r\nfrom it to my chair in the morning--and wait. The assignation is\r\ncertain. \"Life is a coquetry with Death that wearies me, Too sure of the\r\namour.\"\r\n\r\n_July_ 5.\r\n\r\nIt is odd that at this time of the breaking of nations, Destiny, with\r\nher hands so full, should spare the time to pursue a non-combatant atom\r\nlike me down such a labyrinthine side-track. It is odd to find her\r\ndetermined to destroy me with such tremendous thoroughness--one would\r\nhave thought it sufficient merely to brush the dust off my wings. Why\r\nthis deliberate, slow-moving malignity? Perhaps it is a punishment for\r\nthe impudence of my desires. I wanted everything so I get nothing. I\r\ngave nothing so I receive nothing. I am not offering up my life\r\nwillingly--it is being taken from me piece by piece, while I watch the\r\npilfering with lamentable eyes.\r\n\r\nI have tendered my resignation and retire on a small gratuity.\r\n\r\n_July_ 7.\r\n\r\nMy hand gets a little better. But it's a cat and mouse game, and so\r\nhumiliating to be the mouse.\r\n\r\n... Parental affection comes to me only in spasms, and if they hurt,\r\nthey do not last long. Curiously enough, as in the case of very old\r\npeople, my consciousness reverts more easily to conditions long past. I\r\nseem unable to apprehend all the significance of having a nine-months\r\nold daughter, but some Bullfinches or Swallows seen thro' the window\r\nrouse me more. No one can deny I have loved Birds to intoxication. In my\r\nyouth, birds' eggs, and little nestlings and chickens sent me into such\r\nraptures I could never tell it to you adequately.... I am too tired to\r\nwrite more.\r\n\r\n_July_ 23.\r\n\r\nReading Pascal again. If Shelley was \"gold dusty from tumbling among the\r\nstars,\" Pascal was bruised and shaken. The one was delighted, and the\r\nother frightened. I like Pascal's prostration before the infinities of\r\nTime, Space and the Unknown. Somehow, he conveys this more vividly than\r\nthe uplift afforded him by religion.\r\n\r\n_July_ 25.\r\n\r\nI don't believe in the twin-soul theory of marriage. There are plenty of\r\nmen any one of whom she might have married and lived with happily, and\r\nsimpler men than I am. Methinks there are large tracts could be sliced\r\noff my character and she would scarcely feel the want of them. To think\r\nthat she of all women, with a past such as hers, should be swept into my\r\nvicious orbit! Yet she seems to bear Destiny no resentment, so I bear it\r\nfor her and enough for two. At our engagement I gave her my own ring to\r\nwear as a pledge--we thought it nicer than buying a new one. It was a\r\nsignet ring with a dark smooth stone. Strange to say it never once\r\noccurred to me till now that it was a mourning ring in memory of a\r\ngreat-uncle of mine, actually with an inscription on the inside.\r\n\r\n_July_ 26.\r\n\r\nAs long as I can hold a pen, I shall, I suppose, go on trickling ink\r\ninto this diary!\r\n\r\nI am amusing myself by reading the _Harmsworth Encyclopædia_ in 15\r\nvolumes, _i.e._, I turn over the pages and read everything of interest\r\nthat catches my eye.\r\n\r\nI get out of bed about ten, wash and sit by the window in my blue\r\nstriped pyjama suit. It is so hot I need no additional clothing.\r\nE---- comes in, brushes my hair, sprinkles me with lavender water, lights\r\nmy cigarette, and gives me my book-rest and books. She forgets nothing.\r\n\r\nFrom my window I look out on a field with Beech hedge down one side and\r\nbeyond, tall trees--one showing in outline exactly like the profile of a\r\nBeefeater's head, more especially at sunset each evening when the tree\r\nnext behind is in shadow. The field is full of blue Scabious plants,\r\nWild Parsley and tall grass--getting brown now in the sun. Great numbers\r\nof White Butterflies are continually rocking themselves across--they go\r\nover in coveys of four or five at a time--I counted 50 in five minutes,\r\nwhich bodes ill for the cabbages. Not even the heaviest thunder showers\r\nseem to debilitate their kinetic ardour. They rock on like white\r\naeroplanes in a hail of machine-gun bullets.\r\n\r\nThen there are the Swallows and Martins cutting such beautiful figures\r\nthro' the air that one wishes they carried a pencil in their bills as\r\nthey fly and traced the lines of flight on a Bristol board. How I hanker\r\nafter the Swallows! so free and gay and vigorous. This autumn, as they\r\nprepare to start, I shall hang on every twitter they make, and on every\r\nwing-beat; and when they have gone, begin sadly to set my house in\r\norder, as when some much loved visitors have taken their departure. I am\r\nappreciating things a little more the last few days.\r\n\r\n_August_ 1.\r\n\r\n_A Jeremiad_\r\n\r\nWhen I resigned my appointment last month, no one knows what I had to\r\ngive up. But I know. Tho' if I say what I know no one is compelled to\r\nbelieve me excepting out of charity. It will never be discovered whether\r\nwhat I am going to state is not simply despairing bombast. My few\r\nintimate friends and relatives are entirely innocent of science, not to\r\nsay zoology, and all they realise is the significant fact that I am\r\nprone to go extravagant lengths in conversation. But you may take it or\r\nleave it: I was the ablest junior on the staff and one of the ablest\r\nzoologists in the place--but my ability was always muffled by the\r\ninferior work they gave me to do. My last memoir published last December\r\nwas the best of its kind in treatment, method and technique that ever\r\nissued from the institution--I do not say the most important. It was\r\ntrivial--my work always was trivial because they put me in a mouldy\r\ndepartment where all the work was trivial and the methods used as\r\nprimitive, slipshod and easy as those of Fabricius, the idea being that\r\nas I had enjoyed no academic career I was unsuited to fill other posts\r\nthen vacant--one, work on the Cœlenterates and another on _Vermes_,\r\nboth rarely favoured by amateurs and requiring laboratory training.\r\nLater, I had the mortification of seeing these posts filled by men whose\r\npowers I by no means felt inclined to estimate as greater than my own.\r\nMeanwhile, I who had been dissecting for dear life up and down the whole\r\nAnimal Kingdom in a poorly equipped attic laboratory at home, with no\r\nadequate instruments, was bitterly disappointed to find still less\r\nprovision made even in a so-called Scientific Institution so grandly\r\nstyled the British Museum (N.H.). On my first arrival I was presented\r\nwith a pen, ink, paper, ruler, and an enormous instrument of steel which\r\non enquiry I found to be a paper cutter. I asked for my microscope and\r\nmicrotome. I ought to have asked what Form I was in.\r\n\r\nSo I had to continue my struggle against odds, and only within the last\r\nyear or so began to squeeze the authorities with any success. In time I\r\nshould have revolutionised the study of Systematic Zoology, and the\r\nanonymous paper I wrote in conjunction with R---- in the _American\r\nNaturalist_ was a rare _jeu d'esprit_, and my most important scientific\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the literary world I have fared no better. My first published article\r\nappeared at the age of 15 over my father's name, my motive being not so\r\nmuch modesty as cunning--if the literary world (!) ragged it\r\nunmercifully, there was still a chance left for me to make good.\r\n\r\nMy next achievement of any magnitude was the unexpected printing of a\r\nstory in the _Academy_ after I had unsuccessfully badgered almost every\r\nother newspaper. This was when I was 19. No proof had been sent me and\r\nno intimation of its acceptance. Moreover, there were two ugly printer's\r\nerrors. I at once wrote off to correct them in the next issue. My letter\r\nwas neither published nor acknowledged. I submitted, but presently wrote\r\nagain, politely hinting that my cheque was overdue. But--screams of\r\nsilence, and I thought it wise not to complain in view of future\r\nprinting favours. I soon discovered that the journal had changed hands\r\nand was probably on its last legs at the time of my success. As soon as\r\nit grew financially sound again no more of my stories were accepted.\r\n\r\nA more recent affair I had with the American _Forum,_ which delighted me\r\nby publishing my article, but did not pay--tho' the Editor went out of\r\nhis way to write that \"payment was on publication.\" I did not venture to\r\nremonstrate as I had another article on the stocks which they also\r\nprinted without paying me. In spite of uniform failure, my literary\r\nambition has never flagged.[2] I have for years past received my\r\nrejected MSS. back from every conceivable kind of periodical, from\r\n_Punch_ to the _Hibbert Journal_. At one time I used to file their\r\nrejection forms and meditated writing a facetious essay on them. But I\r\ndecided they were too monotonously similar. My custom was when the\r\nordinary avenues to literary fame had failed me--the half-crown Reviews\r\nand the sixpenny Weeklies--to seek out at a library some obscure\r\npublication--a Parish Magazine or the local paper--anything was grabbed\r\nas a last chance. On one of these occasions I discovered the\r\n_Westminster Review_ and immediately plied them with a manuscript and\r\nthe usual polite note. After six weeks, having no reply, I wrote again\r\nand waited for another six weeks. My second remonstrance met with a\r\nsimilar fate, so I went into the city to interview the publishers, and\r\nto demand my manuscript back. The manager was out, and I was asked to\r\ncall again. After waiting about for some time, I left my card, took my\r\ndeparture and decided I would write. The same evening I told the\r\npublishers that the anonymous editor would neither print my article nor\r\nreturn it. Would they kindly give me his name and address so that I\r\ncould write personally. After some delay they replied that although it\r\nwas not the custom to disclose the editor's name, the following address\r\nwould find her. She was a lady living in Richmond Row, Shepherd's Bush.\r\nI wrote to her at once and received no answer. Meanwhile, I had observed\r\nthat no further issues of the review had appeared on the bookstalls, and\r\nthe book-sellers were unable to give me any information. I wrote again\r\nto the address--this time a playful and facetious letter in which I said\r\nI did not propose to take the matter into court, but if it would save\r\nher any trouble I would call for the MS. as I lived only a few minutes'\r\nwalk distant. I received no answer. I was busy at the time and kept\r\nputting off executing my firm purpose of visiting the good lady until\r\none evening as I was casually reading the _Star_ coming home in the\r\n'bus, I read an account of how some charitably disposed woman had\r\nrecently visited the Hammersmith Workhouse and removed to her own home a\r\npoor soul who was once the friend of George Eliot, George Henry Lewes,\r\nand other well-known literary persons of the sixties and had, until it\r\nceased publication a few months before, edited the once notable\r\n_Westminster Review_.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, there has been evidence of a more benevolent attitude\r\ntowards me on the part of London editors. A certain magnificent\r\nquarterly has published one or two of my essays, and one of these called\r\nforth two pages of quotation and flattering comment in _Public Opinion_,\r\nwhich thrill me to the marrow. I fear, however, the flood-tide has come\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this achievement impressed me it did not seem to impress anyone else.\r\nA---- regarded it as a joke and laughed incredulously when someone told\r\nhim of \"P.O.'s\" eulogy. You see I am still his foolish little brother. I\r\nam secretly very nettled too because E---- treated the whole matter very\r\nindifferently. She did not even take the trouble to read the paper's\r\ncritique, and tho' she volunteered to buy several copies to send to\r\nfriends, she never remembered to do so, and the whole affair has passed\r\nout of her mind.\r\n\r\nNow a pleasant paragraph that appeared in the press noticing some\r\ndrawings of a friend of her friend, she read twice and marched off to\r\nFrancesca with it in great glee. Another successful young person got his\r\nphoto into the picture papers--a man we know only by hearsay, and yet it\r\nimpressed her until I recalled, what strange to say she had quite\r\nforgotten, how the photographers wished to publish her own photograph in\r\nthe picture papers at the time of our marriage. But she scornfully\r\nrefused. (And so did I.)\r\n\r\nBut what a queer woman!... [And I, too, a queer man, drunken with\r\nwormwood and gall.]\r\n\r\n_August_ 6.\r\n\r\nE---- and I were very modern in our courtship. Our candour was mutual\r\nand complete--parents and relatives would be shocked and staggered if\r\nthey knew.... You see I am a biologist and we are both freethinkers.\r\n_Voilà_!... I hate all reticence and concealment.... There is a good\r\ndeal of that ass, Gregers Werle, in my nature.\r\n\r\n_August_ 7.\r\n\r\n_My Gastrocnemius_\r\n\r\nI become dreadfully emaciated. This morning, before getting off the bed\r\nI lifted my leg and gazed wistfully along all its length. My flabby\r\n_gastrocnemius_ swung suspended from the _tibia_ like a gondola from a\r\nZeppelin. I touched it gently with the tip of my index finger and it\r\noscillated.\r\n\r\n_August_ 17.\r\n\r\nMy beloved wife comes home this evening after a short, much needed\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\n_August_ 27.\r\n\r\nMy gratuity has turned out to be unexpectedly small. I hoped at least\r\nfor one year's salary. And the horrible thing is I might live for\r\nseveral years longer! No one was ever more enthusiastic for death than I\r\nam at this moment. I hate this world with its war, and I bitterly regret\r\nI never managed to buy laudanum in time. There are only E---- and dear\r\nR---- and one or two others--the rest of the people I know I hate _en\r\nbloc_. If only I could get at them. I hate to have to leave them to\r\nthemselves without getting my own back.\r\n\r\n_August_ 31.\r\n\r\nMy darling sweetheart, you ask me why I love you. I do not know. All I\r\nknow is that I _do_ love you, and beyond measure. Why do _you_ love\r\nme--surely a more inscrutable problem. You do not know. No one ever\r\nknows. \"The heart has its reasons which the reason knows not of.\" We\r\nlove in obedience to a powerful gravitation of our beings, and then try\r\nto explain it by recapitulating one another's characters just as a man\r\nforms his opinions first and then thinks out reasons in support.\r\n\r\nWhat delights me is to recall that our love has _evolved._ It did not\r\nsuddenly spring into existence like some beautiful sprite. It developed\r\nslowly to perfection--it was forged in the white heat of our\r\nexperiences. That is why it will always remain.\r\n\r\n_September_ 1.\r\n\r\nYour love, darling, impregnates my heart, touches it into calm, strongly\r\nbeating life so that when I am with you, I forget I am a dying man. It\r\nis too difficult to believe that when we die true love like ours\r\ndisappears with our bodies. My own experience makes me feel that human\r\nlove is the earnest after death of a great reunion of souls in God who\r\nis love. When as a boy I was bending the knee to Haeckel, the saying,\r\n\"God is Love,\" scarcely interested me. I am wiser now. You must not\r\nthink I am still anything but an infidel (as the churchmen say),--I\r\nshould hate not to be taken for an infidel--and you must not be\r\nsurprised that an embittered, angry, hateful person like myself should\r\nbelieve in a Gospel of Love. I am embittered because an intense desire\r\nto love has in many instances[3] been baulked by my own idealising yet\r\nalso analytical mind. I have wanted to love men blindly, yet I am always\r\nfinding them out, and the disappointment chills the heart. Hence my\r\nmalice and venom: which, dear, do not misconstrue. I am as greedy as an\r\nOctopus, ready out of love to take the whole world into my inside--that\r\nseat of the affections!--but I am also as sensitive as an Octopus, and\r\nquickly retract my arms into the rocky, impregnable recess where I live.\r\n\r\n_September_ 2.\r\n\r\nBut am I dying? I have no presentiments--no conviction--like the people\r\nyou read of in books. Am I, after all, in love? \"I dote yet doubt;\r\nsuspect yet strongly love.\" It is all a matter of degree. Beside Abélard\r\nand Héloïse, our love may be just glassy affection. It is a great and\r\ndifficult question to decide. I love no one else but E----, that, at\r\nleast, is a certainty, and I have never loved anyone more.\r\n\r\n_September_ 3.\r\n\r\nMy bedroom is on the ground floor as I cannot mount the stairs. But the\r\nother day when they were all out, I determined to clamber upstairs if\r\npossible, and search in the bedrooms for a half bottle of laudanum,\r\nwhich Mrs. ---- told me she found the other day in a box--a relic of the\r\ntime when ---- had to take it to relieve pain.\r\n\r\nI got off the bed on to the floor and crawled around on hands and knees\r\nto the door, where I knelt up straight, reached the handle and turned\r\nit. Then I crawled across the hall to the foot of the stairs, where I\r\nsat down on the bottom step and rested. It is a short flight of only 12\r\nsteps and I soon reached the top by sitting down on each and raising\r\nmyself up to the next one with my hands.\r\n\r\nArrived at the top, I quickly decided on the most likely room to search\r\nfirst, and painfully crawled along the passage and thro' the bathroom by\r\nthe easiest route to the small door--there are two. The handles of all\r\nthe doors in the house are fixed some way up above the middle, so that\r\nonly by kneeling with a straight back could I reach them from the floor.\r\nThis door in addition was at the top of a high but narrow step, and I\r\nhad to climb on to this, balance myself carefully, and then carefully\r\npull myself up towards the handle by means of a towel hung on the\r\nhandle. After three attempts I reached the handle and found the door\r\nlocked on the inside.\r\n\r\nI collapsed on the floor and could have cried. I lay on the floor of the\r\nbathroom resting with head on my arm, then set my teeth and crawled\r\naround the passage along two sides of a square, up three more steps to\r\nthe other door which I opened and then entered. I had only examined two\r\ndrawers containing only clothes, when a key turned in the front door\r\nlock and E---- entered with ---- and gave her usual whistle.\r\n\r\nI closed the drawers and crawled out of the room in time to hear\r\nE---- say in a startled voice to her mother: \"Who's that upstairs?\" I\r\nwhistled, and said that being bored I had come up to see the cot: which\r\npassed at that time all right.\r\n\r\nNext morning my darling asked me why I went upstairs. I did not answer,\r\nand I think she knows.\r\n\r\n_September_ 4.\r\n\r\nI am getting ill again, and can scarcely hold the pen. So good-bye\r\nJournal--only for a time perhaps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHave read this blessed old Journal out to E----. It required some\r\ncourage, and I boggled at one or two bits and left them out.\r\n\r\n_September_ 5.\r\n\r\n_Leap-frog_\r\n\r\nSome girls up the road spent a very wet Sunday morning playing leap-frog\r\nin their pyjamas around the tennis lawn. It makes me envious. To think I\r\nnever thought of doing that! and now it is too late. They wore purple\r\npyjamas too. I once hugged myself with pride for undressing in a cave by\r\nthe sea and bathing in the pouring rain, but that seems tame in\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n_Liebestod_\r\n\r\nA perfect autumn morning--cool, fine and still. What sweet music a horse\r\nand cart make trundling slowly along a country road on a quiet morning!\r\nI listened to it in a happy mood of abstraction as it rolled on further\r\nand further away. I put my head out of the window so as to hear it up to\r\nthe very last, until a Robin's notes relieved the nervous tension and\r\nhelped me to resign myself to my loss. The incident reminded me of the\r\nLiebestod in \"Tristan,\" with the Robin taking the part of the harp.\r\n\r\nFor days past my emotions have been undergoing kaleidoscopic changes,\r\nnot only from day to day but from hour to hour. For ten minutes at a\r\ntime I am happy or miserable, or revengeful, venomous, loving, generous,\r\nnoble, angry, or murderous--you could measure them with a stop-watch.\r\nHell's phantoms course across my chest. If I could lie on this bed as\r\nquiet and stony as an effigy on a tomb! But a moment ago I had a sharp\r\nspasm at the sudden thought that never, never, never again should I walk\r\nthro' the path-fields to the uplands.\r\n\r\n_September_ 7.\r\n\r\nMy 28th birthday.\r\n\r\nDear old R---- (the man I love above all others) has been in a military\r\nhospital for months. It is a great hardship to have our intercourse\r\nalmost completely cut off.\r\n\r\nDear old Journal, I love you! Good-bye.\r\n\r\n_September_ 29.\r\n\r\nI could never have believed so great misery compatible with sanity. Yet\r\nI am quite sane. How long I or any man can remain sane in this condition\r\nGod knows.... It is a consummate vengeance this inability to write.[4] I\r\ncannot help but smile grimly at the astuteness of the thrust. To be\r\nsure, how cunning to deprive me of my one secret consolation! How\r\namusing that in this agony of isolation such an aggressive egotist as I\r\nshould have his last means of self-expression cut off. I am being slowly\r\nstifled.\r\n\r\n_Later. (In E.'s handwriting.)_\r\n\r\nYesterday we shifted into a tiny cottage at half the rental of the other\r\none, and situated about two miles further out from the village.... A\r\nwholly ideal and beautiful little cottage you may say. But a\r\n\"camouflaged\" cottage. For in spite of the happiness of its exterior it\r\ncontains just now two of the most dejected mortals even in this present\r\nsorrow-laden world.\r\n\r\n_September_ 30.\r\n\r\nLast night, E---- sitting on the bed by me, burst into tears. It was my\r\nfault. \"I can stand a good deal but there must come a breaking point.\"\r\nPoor, poor girl, my heart aches for you.\r\n\r\nI wept too, and it relieved us to cry. We blew our noses. \"People who\r\ncry in novels,\" E---- observed with detachment, \"never blow their noses.\r\nThey just weep.\" ... But the thunder clouds soon come up again.\r\n\r\n_October_ 1.\r\n\r\nThe immediate future horrifies me.\r\n\r\n_October_ 2.\r\n\r\nPoushkin (as we have named the cat) is coiled up on my bed, purring and\r\nquite happy. It does me good to see him.\r\n\r\nBut consider: A paralytic, a screaming infant, two women, a cat and a\r\ncanary, shut up in a tiny cottage with no money, the war still on, and\r\nfood always scarcer day by day. \"Give us this day, our daily bread.\"\r\n\r\nI want to be loved--above all, I want to love. My great danger is lest I\r\ngrow maudlin and say petulantly, \"Nobody loves me, nobody cares.\" I must\r\nhave more courage and more confidence in other people's good-nature.\r\nThen I can love more freely.\r\n\r\n_October_ 3.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to-day for some happy hours plucked triumphantly from\r\nunder the very nose of Fate, and spent in the warm sun in the garden.\r\nThey carried me out at 12, and I stayed till after tea-time. A Lark\r\nsang, but the Swallows--dear things--have gone. E---- picked two\r\nPrimroses. I sat by some Michaelmas Daisies and watched the Bees, Flies,\r\nand Butterflies.\r\n\r\n_October_ 6.\r\n\r\nIn fits of maudlin self-compassion I try to visualise Belgium, Armenia,\r\nSerbia, etc., and usually cure myself thereby.\r\n\r\n_October_ 12.\r\n\r\nIt is winter--no autumn this year. Of an evening we sit by the fire and\r\nenjoy the beautiful sweet-smelling wood-smoke, and the open hearth with\r\nits big iron bar carrying pot-hook and hanger. E---- knits warm garments\r\nfor the Baby, and I play Chopin, César-Franck hymns, Three Blind Mice\r\n(with variations) on a mouth-organ, called \"The Angels' Choir,\" and made\r\nin Germany.... You would pity me would you? I am lonely, penniless,\r\nparalysed, and just turned twenty-eight. But I snap my fingers in your\r\nface and with equal arrogance I pity you. I pity you your smooth-running\r\ngood luck and the stagnant serenity of your mind. I prefer my own\r\ntorment. I am dying, but you are already a corpse. You have never really\r\nlived. Your body has never been flayed into tingling life by hopeless\r\ndesire to love, to know, to act, to achieve. I do not envy you your\r\nabsorption in the petty cares of a commonplace existence.\r\n\r\nDo you think I would exchange the communion with my own heart for the\r\ntoy balloons of your silly conversation? Or my curiosity for your\r\nflickering interests? Or my despair for your comfortable Hope? Or my\r\npresent tawdry life for yours as polished and neat as a new three-penny\r\nbit? I would not. I gather my mantle around me and I solemnly thank God\r\nthat I am not as some other men are.\r\n\r\nI am only twenty-eight, but I have telescoped into those few years a\r\ntolerably long life: I have loved and married, and have a family; I have\r\nwept and enjoyed; struggled and overcome, and when the hour comes I\r\nshall be content to die.\r\n\r\n_ October_ 14 _to_ 20.\r\n\r\nMiserable.\r\n\r\n_October_ 21.\r\n\r\nSelf-disgust.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n[Barbellion died on December 31.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] John Wesley _rewrote_ his journals from entries in rough draft.\r\n\r\n[2] I once received from an editor a very encouraging letter which gave\r\nme a great deal of pleasure and made me hope he was going to open the\r\npages of his magazine to me.
