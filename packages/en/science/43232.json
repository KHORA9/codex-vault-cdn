Ridgway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I. PREPARATION BY AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been an obvious need in the Geological Survey of a paper\r\ndevoted wholly to illustrations. No complete paper on the character,\r\nuse, and mode of preparation of illustrations has been published by\r\nthe Survey, though brief suggestions concerning certain features of\r\ntheir use have been printed in connection with other suggestions\r\npertaining to publications. The present paper includes matter which it\r\nis hoped will be of service to authors in their work of making up\r\noriginal drafts of illustrations and to draftsmen who are using these\r\noriginals in preparing more finished drawings, but it is not a\r\ntechnical treatise on drafting.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of illustrations does not depend entirely on good\r\ndrawings nor on good reproduction; it may be due in large part to the\r\ninherent character of the rough material submitted. If this material\r\nis effective or striking the finished illustrations, if well made,\r\nwill be equally effective and striking. Each step in the making of an\r\nillustration--first the preparation of the author's original or rough\r\ndraft, next the final drawing, and last the reproduction--is closely\r\nrelated to the others, and each is dependent on the others for good\r\nresults. If the material has been well handled at all three steps the\r\nresulting illustration should be above criticism; if it has been\r\npoorly handled at any one of the three the effectiveness of the\r\nillustration is either impaired or ruined.\r\n\r\nA consideration of processes of reproduction is essential in the\r\npreparation of all illustrations, and the influence or effect of the\r\nprocess to be selected on the methods of preparing a drawing has\r\nseemed to warrant the presentation of brief descriptions of the\r\nprocesses usually employed by the Geological Survey. These\r\ndescriptions include statements as to the kind of copy that is\r\nsuitable for each process, the result produced by each, and the\r\nrelative cost of the processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPOSE AND VALUE OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn illustration in a report of the Geological Survey is not merely a\r\npicture having a remote bearing on the subject matter of the report;\r\nit must represent or explain something discussed or mentioned in order\r\nto become an illustration in the true sense of the term. The\r\nillustrations used in the Survey's reports are not employed for\r\nembellishment; the more pictorial kinds may be in some measure\r\ndecorative, but decoration is distinctly not their primary purpose.\r\nThe illustrations used in popular literature are designed to meet a\r\npublic demand for ornament or attractiveness. Those used in scientific\r\npublications should be made plain and direct, without attempt to\r\nornament or beautify. In the literature of science illustrations made\r\nby the reproduction of photographs or of explanatory diagrams or maps\r\nare intended simply to furnish greater illumination, and if the\r\nillustrations display photographic reality most statements or\r\nconclusions thus illuminated seem less open to dispute. A photograph\r\nmay thus serve the double purpose of explanation and corroboration.\r\nThe graphic expression of data and of details in a Survey report is\r\nintended to aid the reader in comprehending the report, and this is\r\nthe prime advantage of its use, but it also enables the writer to omit\r\nfrom his text numerous descriptive details. It would generally be\r\ndifficult without illustrations to present a clear picture of the\r\ngeology of a region in its exact relations, and especially to describe\r\nadequately the form and the details of the structure of many fossils.\r\nThe tasks of both the writer and the reader of reports on geology and\r\nkindred subjects are thus greatly facilitated by geologic maps,\r\nsections, paleontologic drawings, and illustrations of other kinds.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for good and effective illustrations rests largely\r\nupon the author, who should select and plan his illustrations with a\r\nview to their utility in aiding the reader to understand his report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND APPROVAL OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no rule limiting the number of illustrations that may be used\r\nin a publication of the Geological Survey, but in selecting\r\nillustrations for a report an author may easily fall into the error of\r\nover-illustration. The number of diagrammatic drawings or of drawings\r\nthat express the author's deductions is rarely in excess of the needs\r\nof a paper, but the number of photographs submitted is often\r\nexcessive. The number of pages in a manuscript may be a factor in\r\ndetermining the proper number of illustrations, but as the need of\r\nillustrations varies greatly from paper to paper this factor alone is\r\nnot decisive. The tendency to overillustrate led the Director to issue\r\nthe following order[1] governing the approval of illustrations:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From Survey Order 63, Oct. 20, 1915.]\r\n\r\n     The primary responsibility for the selection of illustrative\r\n     material shall rest upon the author and the chief of the\r\n     branch transmitting the report: No one knows the subject\r\n     matter of the report better than its author, though a\r\n     sympathetic critic is usually needed to correct the personal\r\n     equation that may express itself In an excessive number of\r\n     illustrations or the use of photographs into which no one but\r\n     the field man himself can read what he wishes to illustrate.\r\n     The approval by the chief of branch of the illustrations\r\n     selected by the author will be taken as vouching for those\r\n     illustrations as essential and adequate, and the scientific\r\n     value of the illustrations will not be subject to review in\r\n     the section of illustrations.\r\n\r\n     The chief of the section of illustrations shall decide the\r\n     technical questions relating to the preparation of these\r\n     illustrations for reproduction and may recommend the\r\n     rejection of any that do not promise effective or economical\r\n     reproduction. In the consideration of such questions,\r\n     especially any relating to maps, the cooperation of the\r\n     editor of geologic maps and chief engraver will be expected.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of an author as to the illustrative value of a photograph\r\nis likely to be biased by his knowledge of the features that are\r\nactually included in the view represented, not all of which may be\r\nshown clearly in the photograph; his knowledge of all the features\r\nenables him to see more in his picture than his readers will be able\r\nto recognize without detailed description. Photographs in which\r\nspecial or significant features are obscured by foliage or lost in\r\nhazy distance do not make acceptable illustrations, and the use of a\r\npicture that requires much description to make it illustrate reverses,\r\nin a measure, the relations of text and illustrations.\r\n\r\nA photograph is not necessarily good for reproduction simply because\r\nit shows some particular feature to be illustrated; the quality of the\r\nprint it will afford when reproduced from an engraved plate should\r\nalso be considered. Some loss of detail by reproduction must be\r\nexpected, and therefore only the clearest and most effective prints\r\nobtainable should be submitted.\r\n\r\nIf an author has difficulty in making his preliminary or \"original\"\r\ndrawings he may request that a draftsman be detailed to aid him. The\r\nrequest should be made to the Director through the chief of branch and\r\nproperly approved. The work will then be done in the section of\r\nillustrations as advance preparation, but finished drawings should not\r\nbe thus prepared unless the conditions are unusual. The administrative\r\ngeologist reviews all illustrations submitted and represents the\r\nDirector in matters relating to illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBMITTAL OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll material intended for illustrations, except paleontologic\r\nspecimens, should be submitted with the manuscript of the paper to be\r\nillustrated but in a separate package marked \"Illustrations to\r\naccompany a paper on ---- by ----.\" The package should contain a\r\ncarbon copy of the list of illustrations that accompanies the\r\nmanuscript or, if the titles to be printed on or with the\r\nillustrations include fuller descriptions than are given in that list,\r\na carbon copy of the list giving complete titles and descriptions, the\r\noriginal of which should also accompany the manuscript. In the list\r\neach plate and figure should be separately numbered consecutively in\r\nthe order in which it should appear in the report, and a figure\r\nopposite each title should show the number of the manuscript page on\r\nwhich the illustration is first mentioned or most fully discussed.\r\nRoman numerals should be used for the plates and arabic numerals for\r\nthe figures. Each drawing or photograph should bear, in addition to\r\nthe number and title, any suggestions concerning preparation,\r\nreduction, and method of reproduction which the author may consider\r\nespecially desirable. The list should be headed \"Illustrations.\"\r\n\r\nSpecimens other than fossils that are to be illustrated must be\r\nsubmitted directly to the section of illustrations, but the author may\r\nfirst obtain photographic prints of them in order to make up his\r\nplates. The specimens should be carefully packed and any that are\r\nfragile should be so marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDS OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illustrations in reports of the Geological Survey may be\r\nclassified into five more or less distinct groups--(1) maps, (2)\r\ndiagrams (including graphs, sections, plans, figures of apparatus, and\r\nstereograms), (3) outdoor photographs, (4) photographs and drawings of\r\nspecimens, and (5) sketches. These may be further divided into two\r\nlarge groups, which may be called permanent and ephemeral. The\r\npermanent group includes illustrations that do not lose value through\r\nlapse of time or by natural alteration, such as detailed geologic\r\nmaps, well-prepared structure sections, views of specimens, and good\r\nphotographs or drawings of natural phenomena; the ephemeral group\r\nincludes maps showing progress, key maps, diagrams showing yearly\r\nproduction, and many others that should be prepared in such a way as\r\nto minimize cost of preparation and reproduction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY PREPARATION OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\nPLATE I\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF INSERTING PLATES AND FIGURES.\r\n\r\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, plates; 4, 8, 9, 10, figures; 11, pocket.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations will be finally divided into plates and figures when\r\nthey are fully prepared, but if an author desires to determine the\r\nclassification in advance of transmittal he should submit his material\r\nto the section of illustrations, where methods, processes, and\r\nreductions will be decided for each. In determining which shall be\r\nplates and which shall be figures, size and method of reproduction are\r\nthe only factors to be considered; there are no other real\r\ndifferences. Illustrations that require separate or special printing,\r\nsuch as those reproduced by Lithography and by the photogravure,\r\nphotogelatin, and three-color processes, must be printed separately\r\nfrom the text as plates and inserted in the report at the proper\r\nplaces; those that are reproduced by relief processes, such as zinc\r\nand copper etching and wax engraving, if not too large, can be printed\r\nwith the text as figures. If an illustration to be reproduced by a\r\nrelief process is marked for reduction to a size not exceeding that of\r\nthe page of the text, it can be called a figure and be printed with\r\nthe text. Half tones, though etched in relief, are rarely made text\r\nfigures in Survey reports, because to give satisfactory impressions\r\nthey must be printed on the best quality of coated paper, which is not\r\nused for the text. By using the coarser screens shown in Plate VI (p.\r\n56), however, a half-tone cut may be made that can be used in the text\r\nif it is smaller than the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZES OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regular book publications of the Geological Survey are issued in\r\nthree sizes--(1) octavo (annual reports of the Director, statistical\r\nreports on mineral resources, bulletins, and water-supply papers); (2)\r\nquarto (professional papers and monographs); (3) folio (geologic\r\nfolios). The following table gives the measure of the text of each\r\nsize and the measure of the trimmed page, in inches:\r\n\r\n               Size of text.         Size of page.\r\n\r\nOctavo        4-3/8   by  7-15/16      5-7/8 by  9-1/8\r\nQuarto        6-1/16  by  9-1/8        9-1/4 by 11-5/8\r\nFolio        13-13/16 by 17-7/8       18-1/2 by 21-3/4\r\n\r\nMost professional papers are printed in two columns of type, each 3\r\ninches wide, and folios are printed in three columns, each 4-3/8\r\ninches wide. A text figure in one of these publications can be made to\r\nfit one or more columns, and it may run the full length of the text\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the dimensions of plates and figures, in inches, are\r\ngiven in the following table. If for any reason a plate can not be\r\nreduced to the dimensions of a page it can be folded once or more; and\r\nif it is large and unwieldy it may be placed in a pocket on the inside\r\nof the back cover. (See Pl. I.)\r\n\r\n            Single-page       Plate with\r\n               plate.        one side fold.         Text figure.\r\n\r\n  Octavo   4-3/8 by  7-1/2  7-1/2 by  8-1/2         4-3/8      by  7-1/2\r\n  Quarto   6     by  9      9-1/2 by 14-3/4         3 or 6     by  8-1/2\r\n  Folio   15     by 17-1/2   ............    4-3/8 or 13-13/16 by 17-7/8\r\n\r\nFor an octavo report a single-page plate with side title should be 4\r\ninches or less in width, and a plate with bottom title should be 7\r\ninches or less in depth. In other words, the actual depth and width\r\nof a single-page plate in a page of any size must depend on the number\r\nof lines in its title, the inclusion of which should not extend the\r\nmatter much, if any, beyond the dimensions given in the table. A\r\ndifference of 1 inch or less in the width of a folding plate may\r\ndetermine whether it must be folded once or twice, so that by\r\nconsulting this table an author may save expense in binding and\r\npromote the reader's convenience in handling the plate.\r\n\r\nA text figure (including the title) can not extend beyond the text\r\nmeasure but may be of any size or shape within that measure, as shown\r\non Plate I, figures 4, 8, 9, 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBDIVISIONS OF PLATES AND FIGURES.\r\n\r\nIf a plate consists of two or more parts or photographs each part\r\nshould be marked with an italic capital letter--=A=, =B=, etc.--which\r\nshould be placed directly under each. If it is made up of many parts,\r\nin the form of plates that accompany reports on paleontology, each\r\npart should be similarly marked with an arable numeral--1, 2, 3, etc.\r\nIf a text figure is subdivided into two or more parts, each part\r\nshould be marked with a roman capital--A, B, C, etc.; and if details\r\nof a part are to be described each detail should be marked by an\r\nitalic lower-case letter--a, 6, c, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF COPY BY AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL.\r\n\r\nIn the Geological Survey, as elsewhere, the \"originals\"--that is, the\r\noriginal material submitted by authors for the illustration of their\r\nreports--differ greatly in character and in degree of clearness. Some\r\nare carefully prepared; others are rough, obscure in part, and\r\ndefective in detail. Drawings made from poor originals progress\r\nslowly, because the draftsman spends much time in interpreting\r\nuncertain features or in conference with the author concerning\r\ndetails. An original should be perfectly clear in detail and meaning,\r\nso that the draftsman can follow it without doubt. It should not\r\nconsist of parts that must be brought together to make a new drawing,\r\nbecause the result of the combination of the parts will be uncertain\r\nat the outset and may not prove satisfactory. Each original\r\nillustration should be prepared with the idea that the draftsman who\r\nwill make the finished drawing will be unfamiliar with the subject and\r\nwill need definite instructions; all data should be plotted and each\r\nfigure or plate should be completely made up before it is submitted.\r\nMore or less roughly prepared originals are expected, but they should\r\nshow no uncertainty in details. Obscure features may be cleared up by\r\ninclosing the features in penciled loops connected by a line with\r\nnotes written on the margin, such as \"omit this line,\" \"turn at an\r\nangle of 30° from true north,\" \"add,\" \"cut out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PREPARATION OF MAPS.\r\n\r\nThe base map that generally accompanies a report may be an original\r\nfield sheet or it may have been compiled from various sources by an\r\nauthor and made to incorporate the results of his field work. It\r\nshould not be a collection of maps of different scales and standards\r\nto be worked into a new map.\r\n\r\nThe source of the data shown on every original base map should be\r\nindicated on the map, whether it is to be used as an illustration or\r\nas a record of field work. This information is required as a permanent\r\nrecord for showing the reliability of the map, for use in comparing\r\ndata, and for giving full credit to those who are responsible for the\r\ndata. An author should see that this requirement is observed in order\r\nthat proper credit may be given and should especially see that all\r\ncooperative agreements and organizations are properly mentioned.\r\n\r\nAn original map should preferably be complete in itself. It should not\r\nconsist of several parts or sheets unless the data to be represented\r\nare unusually complex. All elaborate or technical finish of border\r\nlines, lettering, or like features should be left to the draftsman or\r\nthe engraver.\r\n\r\nBase maps that involve the compilation of new data should be prepared\r\nby either the topographic branch or the division of Alaskan mineral\r\nresources. If a base map already published is to be reused it should\r\nbe submitted to the chief topographic engineer or to the chief of the\r\ndivision of Alaskan mineral resources for approval. This procedure\r\nwill insure a single standard of geographic accuracy in maps appearing\r\nin Survey publications.\r\n\r\nA geologist who requires a base map that includes new topographic data\r\nshould address a request for its preparation to the chief geologist,\r\nwho, through the Director, will refer the request to the topographic\r\nbranch. The request must be accompanied by a full statement regarding\r\nthe proposed report and the time when it is likely to be submitted.\r\nThe preparation of such base maps by draftsmen in the division of\r\ngeology, the land-classification board, the water-resources branch, or\r\nthe section of illustrations has been discontinued except for the\r\nminor adaptations provided for above.\r\n\r\nIf a report requires the preparation of a base map that includes no\r\nnew topographic data such a map must be compiled from other authentic\r\nmaps by the division or branch in which the report originates. If,\r\nhowever, no draftsmen are available in that division or branch, an\r\narrangement can be made with any other branch--as the topographic or\r\npublication branch--that may have draftsmen available, with the\r\nunderstanding that the cost of the work shall be reimbursed to the\r\nbranch doing the work by the branch ordering it. For indicating\r\ngeologic and other data, however, an author may make use of an\r\nauthentic base map already published, and after it is reduced or\r\nenlarged to appropriate scale by photography such a map may suffice\r\nfor transmittal with a manuscript.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR BASE MAPS.\r\n\r\nThe maps already published by the Geological Survey[2] and other\r\nGovernment bureaus should always be consulted when a new base is to be\r\ncompiled. The following list includes most of the maps available:\r\n\r\n1. The Survey's regular topographic atlas sheets, published on three\r\nscales--15-minute sheets, scale, 1:62,500; 30-minute sheets, scale,\r\n1:125,000; 60-minute sheets, scale, 1:250,000--approximately 1 mile, 2\r\nmiles, and 4 miles to 1 inch, respectively--and its \"special\" maps,[2]\r\nsome of which are published on other scales. All these maps can be\r\nused as bases for detailed geologic maps, for compiling maps on\r\nsmaller scales, and for revising other maps.\r\n\r\n2. The United States part of the international map of the world, now\r\nbeing published on the scale of 1:1,000,000 (approximately 16 miles to\r\n1 inch). Each sheet of this map represents an area measuring 6° of\r\nlongitude and 4° of latitude. The published sheets of this map may be\r\nused as bases for general maps. The sheets are drawn on the scale of\r\n1:500,000, and photolithographs on this scale are available for use as\r\nbases for geologic or other maps.\r\n\r\nThe adaptability of the 1:1,000,000 scale map to use as a base for\r\ngeneral geologic maps is shown in the geologic maps of the southern\r\npeninsula of Michigan and of Indiana in Monograph 53 (Pls. IV and\r\nVII), the map of Florida in Bulletin 60 (Pl. I), and the map of\r\nVermont in Water-Supply Paper 424 (Pl. I).\r\n\r\n3. The Survey's two-sheet wall map of the United States, 49 by 76\r\ninches, scale 1:2,500,000 (approximately 40 miles to 1 inch). Parts of\r\nthis map can be used as bases for general geologic or other maps and\r\nas copy for index and other small diagrammatic maps. This map is\r\npublished both with and without contours.\r\n\r\n4. Land Office maps and township plats. These maps are now being\r\npublished on a scale of 12 miles to 1 inch; they are also\r\nphoto-lithographed on one-half that scale, or 24 miles to 1 inch. The\r\ntownship plats are printed on a scale of one-half mile to 1 inch. The\r\nmaps are especially useful in compiling maps in which land lines\r\n(townships and sections) are essential, and the township plats afford\r\nvaluable detail and are useful in field work and in revising other\r\nmaps. Township and section lines should appear on all\r\nland-classification maps published by the Survey. On maps on a scale\r\nless than 1:250,000 only the townships should be shown; on maps on\r\nscales greater than 1:250,000 the sections should be shown; on maps on\r\na scale of 1:250,000 the sections should be shown, unless their\r\nrepresentation will materially impair the legibility of the map, in\r\nwhich case only the townships should be shown. (See fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n5. Post-route maps, covering single States or groups of adjacent\r\nStates, published on sheets of different sizes and on scales\r\ndetermined mainly by the size of the State. The map of Texas is\r\npublished on a scale of 12 miles to 1 inch, that of Virginia on a\r\nscale of 7 miles to 1 inch, and that of West Virginia on a scale of 6\r\nmiles to 1 inch. Both the Land Office and the post-route maps are\r\nuseful for reference in compiling maps on smaller scales. Post-route\r\nmaps are especially useful for comparing and verifying the location of\r\ncities, towns, and railroads.\r\n\r\n6. Coast and Geodetic Survey charts, published on scales that are\r\ngoverned by the area represented and the amount of detail to be shown.\r\nThese maps should always be used in compiling and correcting coast\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n7. Maps and charts published by the Corps of Engineers of the Army,\r\nthe Mississippi River Commission, the surveys of the Great Lakes, and\r\nthe boundary surveys. These maps are especially useful if the scale of\r\nthe map to be compiled requires considerable detail.\r\n\r\n8. The Survey's three small base maps of the United States--(_a_) a\r\nmap 18 by 28 inches, scale 110 miles to 1 inch, which is published\r\nboth with and without contours, or with relief or hypsometric shading;\r\n(_b_) a map 11 by 16 inches, scale 190 miles to 1 inch; (_c_) a map\r\n7-1/2 by 12 inches, scale 260 miles to 1 inch, designed for use as a\r\ntwo-page illustration in a bulletin or a water-supply paper.\r\n\r\n9. The Century, Rand McNally & Co.'s, Cram's, Stieler's, The Times,\r\nJohnston's Royal, and county atlases.\r\n\r\n10. State and county maps.\r\n\r\n11. Railroad surveys, which are useful in furnishing data for\r\nelevations as well as for locations of towns and stations.\r\n\r\n12. The latest national-forest maps and proclamations. It is, however,\r\nnot necessary that national forests, bird reservations, and national\r\nmonuments be shown on a map in a report unless their addition is\r\nspecially requested by the author or by the chief of the branch\r\nsubmitting the report, and they should not be shown if they will\r\nobscure other more important data.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See \"Topographic maps and folios and geologic folios\r\npublished by the United States Geological Survey\" (latest edition).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--Diagrams showing principal, guide, and\r\nauxiliary meridians, standard and special parallels and correction\r\nlines, and system of numbering townships, ranges, and sections.]\r\n\r\nThe Survey has published numerous maps of parts of Alaska, as well as\r\nother maps, which are available for use or reuse in its reports.\r\nCopies of all base maps for which copper plates have been engraved by\r\nthe Survey can be obtained on requisition, and their use in a new\r\nreport will save time as well as the cost of engraving. Other maps\r\nwill be found in the Survey library, where the latest editions only\r\nshould be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC FEATURES OF MAPS.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that \"every map, whatever its scale, is a\r\nreduction from nature and consequently must be more or less\r\ngeneralized.\"[3] The degree of generalization in the geologic and\r\nother detail to be shown on a map usually involves a corresponding\r\ndegree of generalization in its base. Absolutely true generalization\r\nmeans the same degree of omission of detail for each kind of feature.\r\nIf a base map on a scale of 1 mile to 1 inch, prepared with the usual\r\ndetail, were placed before a camera and reduced to a scale of 16 miles\r\nto 1 inch, the lines representing the smaller tributaries of streams\r\nand the smaller water bodies, as well as many other features, would\r\nprobably be so greatly reduced in length as to be illegible. If from\r\nthis reduced photograph a new map were prepared, from which all\r\nfeatures not plainly discernible were omitted, the new map should\r\nrepresent what might be called true generalization. This degree of\r\ngeneralization is, however, not practicable, but unessential detail\r\nshould be systematically omitted. The amount of detail which a base\r\nmap should show is limited by its scale, by the character of the\r\ncountry it represents, and by the kind of data to be shown. Coordinate\r\nfeatures of a topographic map should be shown with equal detail.\r\nDetail in culture may call for detail in drainage, though relief may\r\nbe greatly generalized or entirely omitted; detail in relief may\r\nlike-wise call for detail in drainage, though culture may be more\r\ngeneralized.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Gannett, Henry, A manual of topographic methods: U. S.\r\nGeol. Survey Mon. 22, p. 107, 1893.]\r\n\r\nIf the three fundamental features of a topographic map--the culture,\r\nthe drainage, and the relief--are to be engraved or photo-lithographed\r\nseparately and printed in colors, the best results can be obtained by\r\ndrawing each feature in a separate color on one sheet unless the work\r\nis coarse and great precision in register is not needed. The culture\r\nshould be drawn in black waterproof ink, the drainage in Prussian\r\nblue, and the relief in burnt sienna; but care should be taken that\r\nthe colors used will photograph well. To insure a good photograph it\r\nis usually necessary to add a little black to the blue and brown. (See\r\n\"Inks,\" p. 25.) The photographer will then make three negatives and\r\nwill opaque or paint out all but one of the three features on each\r\nnegative. The cost is somewhat greater than that of reproducing three\r\nseparate drawings, but the result gives more accurate register than if\r\nthe drawings were made on separate sheets, which are likely to change\r\nin size before they are reproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD SCALES.\r\n\r\nThe standard scales of the maps used in the publications of the\r\nGeological Survey are fractions or multiples of 1:1,000,000 (see p.\r\n14), except for a map that is reduced expressly to fit one or two\r\npages of a report or that is reduced horizontally or vertically to fit\r\nthe text as a small diagrammatic or index map. It should be remembered\r\nthat a map which may be serviceable for use in compiling a new map,\r\nexcept as to scale, can be reduced or enlarged to the scale of the new\r\ndrawing by photography, by a pantograph, or by other means. (See p.\r\n47.)\r\n\r\nMaps compiled by an author should be prepared on a scale of at least\r\n1-1/2 times and preferably twice the size of the scale used on the\r\npublished map. Maps traced on linen should be no less than twice the\r\nsize of publication. Not only is the quality of the reproduction\r\nimproved by considerable reduction, but the larger scale of the\r\ndrawing facilitates the plotting of details. It should be remembered,\r\nhowever, that a linear reduction of one-half produces a map only\r\none-fourth the area of the original, and reduction so great may\r\nprevent the addition of data, such as an extended note in small\r\nletters applying to a small area on the face of a map, which would not\r\nbe legible when reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIENTATION OF MAPS.\r\n\r\nA map that bears no arrow indicating north is supposed to be oriented\r\nnorth and south, and its title should read from west to east. If,\r\nhowever, the area mapped has a general trend in one direction, as\r\nnorthwest to southeast, and its squaring up by a north-south line\r\nwould leave too much blank paper, this general rule is not followed.\r\nThe border lines on such a map should conform to the general trend of\r\nthe area mapped, an arrow should show north, and the title and scale\r\nshould be placed horizontally, but the projection numbers and town\r\nnames should follow the direction of the parallels of latitude. (See\r\nPis. X and XII, Bull. 628; and Pis. VI, XV, and XVI, Mon. 52.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECTION.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See also pp. 43-45, where the method of projecting a map\r\nis more fully explained.]\r\n\r\nThe polyconic projection has been adopted by the Geological Survey for\r\nits topographic atlas sheets and must be consistently used for its\r\nother maps. If a new map is to be compiled an accurate projection\r\nshould first be constructed, and no plotting should be done on it\r\nuntil the projection has been checked and found to be correct. A\r\nprojection should be checked or proved by some one other than the\r\nperson who prepared it. Next the drainage and the water areas should\r\nbe outlined; then the cultural features should be added; and finally\r\nthe relief, whether expressed by contour lines, hachures, or\r\nshading.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See pp. 49-48 for methods of tracing and transferring.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading \"Explanation\" should be placed all matter needed to\r\ndescribe fully the details of an illustration, whether map, diagram,\r\nor section, so that if the illustration became detached it would be a\r\ncomplete self-explanatory unit.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of a map may be placed inside the border lines if\r\nthere is ample room for it, or it may be placed outside. The standard\r\narrangement for an outside explanation for geologic maps is shown, in\r\nthe geologic folios, which should be followed in general form. If\r\nthere is space within the border lines the explanation may be\r\nappropriately arranged therein, either in a vertical column or\r\nhorizontally, according to the size and shape of the space available.\r\nIf the sequence of formation is shown by horizontal arrangement the\r\nyounger formations are placed at the left and the older at the right.\r\nIf it is shown by a vertical arrangement the youngest formation is\r\nplaced at the top.\r\n\r\nEach original map submitted by an author should have at least 4-1/2\r\ninches of blank margin on the right and at the bottom in which to\r\nplace the explanation, scale, title, and other matter, but the author\r\nshould make no attempt to elaborate these features nor should he\r\nemploy a draftsman to letter them carefully. Plainly written ordinary\r\nscript is quits sufficient for original maps; the final lettering,\r\nwhich may consist entirely of impressions from type, will be added\r\nafter submittal of a report.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLES OF MAPS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe titles of maps should be supplied by authors but are subject to\r\nrevision in order to make them agree with established forms. They\r\nshould be written in ordinary script, not carefully lettered. They\r\nshould state concisely the kind of map, the area shown, the special\r\nfeatures represented, and the county, State, or Territory in which the\r\narea is located. (See p. 58.) Titles are reproduced directly only on\r\nlithographs, three-color prints, photogelatin plates, and other\r\nillustrations that are printed by contractors, not by the Government\r\nPrinting Office. The titles of illustrations that are reproduced by\r\nrelief processes, such as zinc etching, half tone, and wax engraving,\r\nare printed at the Government Printing Office from type, and proofs\r\nare submitted to the authors for examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMBOLS USED ON MAPS.\r\n\r\nGENERAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nMore than 200 symbols have been used on maps to express 25 different\r\nkinds of data, a fact indicating at once a notable lack of uniformity\r\nand a need of standardization. It is of course impossible to provide a\r\ncharacteristic symbol that can be used uniformly for each kind of\r\nfeature, and therefore the same symbol may be used on different maps\r\nto express different things. The symbols shown in Plate II are those\r\nmost used on geologic maps. The symbols for dip and strike, fault\r\nlines, mine shafts, prospects, and several others are generally well\r\nknown, but on some maps it may be necessary to modify a standard\r\nsymbol to express additional distinctions. The symbols shown, however,\r\nwill cover all the ordinary requirements of miscellaneous mapping.\r\nThough the plate shows more than one symbol for some features the\r\nsymbol most commonly used is given first and should be preferred. The\r\ncenter of each symbol should mark the location of the feature\r\nsymbolized. Symbols are not always platted with sufficient care. On\r\nsmall-scale maps they are difficult to locate and unless great care is\r\ntaken in platting them they are likely to be several miles out of\r\nplace. All symbols should be located precisely where they belong.\r\n\r\nThe symbol showing dip and strike should be accurately platted by\r\nmeans of a protractor, so that the strike will be shown graphically,\r\nwithout a number and a degree mark, and not need replatting by a\r\ndraftsman or engraver. The dip, however, should be indicated by a\r\nnumber and a degree mark.\r\n\r\nLETTER SYMBOLS.\r\n\r\nThe letter symbols used on most geologic maps to indicate the ages\r\nand names of the formations represented consist of two or more\r\nletters--an initial capital letter for the name of the system and\r\none or more lower-case letters for the name of the formation or of\r\nthe material, as Qt (Quaternary--lower terrace deposits); Cpv\r\n(Carboniferous--Pottsville formation); COk (Cambrian-Ordovician--Knox\r\ndolomite), etc. The standard usage for this feature is shown in the\r\ngeologic folios but is subject to modification in other publications.\r\n\r\nIn preparing an original geologic map a letter symbol, such as has\r\nbeen just described, or a number should be put in the proper place in\r\nthe explanation, and the same symbol or number should be repeated at\r\none or more places on the map within the areas to which it refers.\r\nEach area that is indicated by a color should be marked with the\r\nproper symbol in order to make its identification sure, for light\r\ncolors especially are likely to fade and mixed colors can not be\r\ndiscriminated with certainty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF ILLUSTRATIONS PLATE II\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMBOLS USED ON GEOLOGIC MAPS, ECONOMIC MAPS AND MINE PLANS]\r\n\r\nOIL AND GAS SYMBOLS.\r\n\r\nA complete set of symbols for maps showing oil and gas is given on\r\nPlate II. Referring to these symbols the chief geologist, in a\r\nmemorandum to the Director, writes:\r\n\r\n     The symbols used by the Survey in its oil and gas maps have\r\n     not been in accord with those used by the oil companies, nor\r\n     have they been wholly logical. It appears that though they\r\n     were submitted for recommendation they never have been\r\n     formally approved.\r\n\r\n     Herewith I submit a code prepared by the geologists of the\r\n     oil and gas section. They conform largely to commercial use\r\n     and embrace its best features as well as the best and most\r\n     logical features of our previous usage, the departures from\r\n     which are, after all, of minor consequence.\r\n\r\n     The symbols here submitted [see PI. II] with recommendation\r\n     for approval are founded on a building-up system, so that the\r\n     history and the results of drilling at any location can be\r\n     recorded by slight additions to symbol and without erasure.\r\n     Thus maps may be revised without scratching.\r\n\r\n     In drawing these symbols the draftsman should make the rays\r\n     of the gas well distinct and in adding the vertical bar or\r\n     line showing that a hole is dry or abandoned should make it\r\n     long enough to be distinct. It would be preferable to draw\r\n     this bar obliquely, but an oblique position would coincide\r\n     with some of the patterns on certain maps, and it should\r\n     therefore be placed vertically. The vertical line indicates\r\n     the failure or abandonment of the well, the symbol for which\r\n     Is thus scratched off or canceled by the line drawn through\r\n     it. The symbols agree so far with commercial usage that oil\r\n     men will have little need to consult the explanation.\r\n\r\nSYMBOLS FOR USE ON MAPS SHOWING FEATURES OF GROUND WATER.\r\n\r\nThe symbols used on maps relating to ground water represent the\r\nfeatures named below, each of which has been shown in publications\r\nalready issued.\r\n\r\n  Area of absorption or outcrop.        Area that discharges ground water.\r\n  Depth to water table.                 Quality of ground water.\r\n  Contours of water table.              Area irrigated with ground water.\r\n  Fluctuation of water table.           Nonflowing well.\r\n  Depth to water-bearing formation.     Flowing well.\r\n  Structure contours of water-bearing   Unsuccessful or dry well,\r\n    formation.                          Well with pumping plant.\r\n  Area of artesian flow.                Spring.\r\n  Head of artesian water.\r\n\r\nThe lack of uniformity in the symbols commonly employed to represent\r\nthese features is due to differences in the number of color on the\r\nmaps and differences in the scale. Standard colors for the larger\r\nfeatures, such as those for areas of artesian flow, areas of\r\nabsorption, and curves showing depths to water table or to\r\nwater-bearing formations, can not be fixed, because of considerations\r\nof economy in printing. For example, if light green is the standard\r\ncolor to be used for delineating areas irrigated by ground water and\r\nno green is used on other parts of the map its use would represent an\r\nadditional or special printing, whereas a tint of blue, brown, or\r\npurple, if any of these colors is used for other features on the map,\r\nmight be used also for this feature without additional printing.\r\nTherefore the general use of any particular color for a water feature\r\nseems to be impracticable; but this fact should not preclude the\r\nadoption of color standards for use subject to the requirements of\r\neconomy in publication.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary symbols for wells are the open circle and the solid\r\ncircle, or dot. Only in the secondary or specific well symbols does\r\nthere appear to be lack of uniformity, the choice of secondary symbols\r\nbeing governed either by personal preference or by the requirements\r\nfor specific distinction.\r\n\r\nAll symbols should, if possible, suggest the things they represent.\r\nWells are circular and hence the open circle is most used and most\r\nappropriate for nonflowing wells. To indicate a flowing well the\r\ncircle is made solid, denoting that the well is full of water. For an\r\nunsuccessful well the most suggestive symbol would be an open circle\r\nwith a line drawn through it to denote cancellation. It has been\r\nsuggested that if water features, including wells, are to be printed\r\nin blue, unsuccessful wells, or dry holes, be printed in black. A\r\nlarge circle drawn around the symbol for a flowing or nonflowing well\r\nwill appropriately denote a pumping plant at the well.\r\n\r\nThe accepted symbol for a spring is a dot with a waved tail\r\nrepresenting the direction of flow, if known. This symbol can not be\r\nmodified without destroying its prime characteristics, but it may be\r\naccompanied by a letter indicating the kind of spring. An open circle\r\nwith a tail might be used on large-scale maps, but it would be out of\r\nscale on other maps, whereas the black or blue dot and tail will fit\r\nmaps of any scale.\r\n\r\nThe following colors and symbols can most appropriately be used to\r\nrepresent ground-water features. The well and spring symbols can be\r\nvaried by adding letters if they are necessary to express other data\r\nthan those indicated in the list below.\r\n\r\n_General ground-water features._\r\n\r\n  Area of absorption or outcrop: Flat color used on the map to\r\n     show the geologic system in which the absorbing formation\r\n     occurs.\r\n\r\n  Areas showing depths to water table: Shades of purple and gray;\r\n     if possible the shades showing the areas of least depth\r\n     should be darkest and the shades should grade from those to\r\n     lighter tints.\r\n\r\n  Contours of water table, or contours on water-bearing\r\n     formations: Gray or purple curves or lines.\r\n\r\n  Areas of artesian flow: Blue flat tint, or fine ruling in blue.\r\n     Depth to water-bearing formations: Gradation of a single\r\n     color or of two related colors from dark for shallow depths\r\n     to light for greater depths.\r\n\r\n  Nonflowing artesian areas (pumped wells): Green flat tint, or\r\n     fine ruling in green. Depth to water-bearing formations shown\r\n     by gradation of tint if possible from dark for shallow depths\r\n     to light for greater depths.\r\n\r\n  Head of artesian water: Blue curves or lines.\r\n\r\n  Areas that discharge ground water: Blue flat tint, or fine\r\n     ruling in blue.\r\n\r\n  Areas irrigated with ground water: Green flat tint, or fine\r\n     ruling in green.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration] Well, character not indicated. [Illustration]\r\n     Well, nonflowing. [Illustration] Well, flowing.\r\n     [Illustration] Well, unsuccessful or dry. [Illustration]\r\n     Well, nonflowing, with pumping plant [Illustration] Well,\r\n     flowing, with pumping plant. [Illustration] Springs.\r\n     [Illustration] Spring, thermal. [Illustration] Spring,\r\n     mineral.\r\n\r\nThe standard color scheme should be used if no conditions preclude its\r\nuse, but if other colors can be used with greater economy without\r\nsacrificing clearness the use of the standard colors should be waived.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK-LINE CONVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nA complete set of the black-line patterns used to distinguish areas on\r\na map is given in Plate VIII (p. 60), and their application to a\r\nfinished drawing is shown in figure 9 (p. 62). These patterns,\r\nhowever, should preferably not be used by the author in his\r\npreliminary work on an illustration. For this purpose water colors or\r\ncolored crayons are preferable, and the distinctions between areas may\r\nbe emphasized by letter symbols.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS USED IN PREPARING MAPS.\r\n\r\nPAPER.\r\n\r\nFor large and important maps which may at some time be extended to\r\ncover a greater area or which may be made to fit maps already prepared\r\nor published the paper used should be mounted on muslin to reduce to a\r\nminimum the shrinking or stretching caused by atmospheric changes.\r\nPure white paper produces a better negative than a cream or yellowish\r\npaper and will retain its color longer, but all papers become more\r\nyellow with age and exposure to light.\r\n\r\nThe following brands of paper are used in the Survey in the\r\npreparation of maps:\r\n\r\n\"Normal\" K. & E., unmounted. Has an excellent surface and comes in\r\nflat sheets, 19 by 24, 22 by 30, and 27 by 40 inches.\r\n\r\n\"Paragon\" K. & E., mounted on muslin. In 10-yard rolls 72 inches wide.\r\nUsed in the Survey for large office drawings and maps of large scale.\r\n\r\n\"Anvil\" K. & E., mounted on muslin. In 10-yard rolls 42, 62, and 72\r\ninches wide. Used in the Survey for large drawings.\r\n\r\n\"Whatman's hot pressed,\" unmounted or mounted on muslin. In sheets\r\nranging in size from 13 by 17 to 31 by 53 inches. An excellent paper\r\nfor maps. The muslin-backed paper is recommended for use in preparing\r\nlarge detailed maps and base maps that are to be retained as permanent\r\nrecords. The muslin provides a durable and flexible backing that\r\npermits the map to be rolled, and paper thus mounted is particularly\r\nserviceable for a map which may be subjected to considerable revision\r\nand to which must be added finally a title, explanation, and other\r\nmarginal matter.\r\n\r\n\"Ross's relief hand-stipple drawing paper.\" A stiff enameled or\r\nchalk-coated paper whose surface has been compressed into minute\r\npoints that stand in slight relief so that a shade made on it with\r\npencil or crayon is broken up into dots and can be reproduced by\r\nphoto-engraving. For use in making shaded drawings, drawings showing\r\nrelief by light and shade, etc. Similar paper is prepared for\r\nparallel-line and other pattern effects. In sheets ranging in size\r\nfrom 11 by 14 to 22 by 28 inches. (See p. 51 for method of using.)\r\n\r\nProfile and cross-section paper. In sheets of convenient sizes or in\r\nrolls. Bears lines printed in blue, green, red, or orange, in many\r\nkinds of rulings, which may be selected by reference to catalogues.\r\nProfile and cross-section paper printed in orange is recommended for\r\npreliminary drawings; blue is recommended for drawings that are made\r\nin pencil and submitted for inking in.\r\n\r\nBRISTOL BOARD.\r\n\r\nFor the smaller maps, such as key maps and maps less than 18 by 24\r\ninches, and for small drawings made for direct reproduction,\r\nReynolds's bristol board is recommended on account of its pure-white\r\ncolor and its hardness, which permits erasures to be made without\r\naffecting redrawing over the corrected area. It is obtained in 2-ply,\r\n3-ply, and 4-ply sheets. The 2-ply and 3-ply are especially useful in\r\nmaking delicate brush and pencil drawings and pen and ink drawings.\r\nThe sizes used in the Survey are 16-1/2 by 20-3/4, 18-1/4 by 22-3/8,\r\nand 21-1/2 by 28-3/4 inches.\r\n\r\nTRACING LINEN.\r\n\r\nTracing cloth or linen is especially useful for large work that will\r\nrequire considerable reduction. (See p. 18.) Its advantages are that a\r\ntracing that has been carefully made on it over any kind of copy for\r\ndirect reproduction by a photo-engraving process can be used for\r\nmaking a paper negative for contact printing or blue printing. On the\r\nother hand, it is susceptible to atmospheric changes that affect\r\nscale, and the lines traced on it are not reproduced as sharply as\r\nthose made on paper. It can be obtained in rolls 30 to 54 inches wide.\r\n\r\nErasures should be made on tracing linen with a hard rubber eraser,\r\nnot with a sand rubber or a steel eraser.\r\n\r\nINKS.\r\n\r\nThe best drawing inks are in liquid form, ready for use. They should\r\nbe waterproof and equal to the grade known as Higgins's waterproof\r\nink. When a suitable waterproof blue ink can not be obtained, a good\r\nblue for features of drainage can be made by dissolving a half pan of\r\nWinsor & Newton's prussian blue in water. No good waterproof burnt\r\nsienna ink seems to be obtainable, but a good substitute can be made\r\nby dissolving Winsor & Newton's water color of that name.\r\n\r\nInk lines should be drawn in full strength of color--lines that should\r\nbe black must not appear grayish, for example--and pens should be kept\r\nclean. The same pen should not be used for applying two inks, as the\r\nmixture thus produced is likely to thicken or coagulate on the pen. A\r\nlittle black should be added to colored inks that are used in making\r\ndrawings to be reproduced in colors in order to strengthen the lines\r\nfor photographic reproduction.\r\n\r\nDRAWING PENS.\r\n\r\nThe pens made by Keuffel & Esser, especially their No. 3202, and\r\nGillott's Nos. 291, 290, 170, and 303 give complete satisfaction. The\r\nGillott numbers are given in the order of fineness of the points. No.\r\n291 being the finest. The best cleaner for a drawing pen is a piece of\r\nchamois skin.\r\n\r\nPENCILS.\r\n\r\nPencils used for drawing should have leads of a quality equal to those\r\nof the Koh-i-noor brand, in which the grades of hardness are indicated\r\nby 3B, 2B, B, HB, F, H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, and 9H; the\r\nsoftest grade is 3B and the hardest 9H. The grades most generally used\r\nare B, HB, F, 4H, and 6H.\r\n\r\nRUBBER ERASERS AND CLEANERS.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of rubber erasers are usually employed in making erasures on\r\ndrawings--a hard, dense rubber like the \"Ruby,\" and a soft, pliable\r\nrubber like the \"Venus\" or \"H\" (Hardtmuth). The soft rubber is also\r\nuseful for cleaning large surfaces. Art gum is also recommended for\r\nthis purpose and has the advantage of not disturbing the surface of\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\nCOLORED PENCILS AND CRAYONS.\r\n\r\nColored pencils and crayons are useful only for coloring preliminary\r\nmaps. They are not recommended for use on maps that are to be kept for\r\nreference or to be submitted for reproduction, because the colors rub\r\noff, but they can be used on photographic prints of base maps or on\r\ntransparent oversheets, for which the unglazed side of tracing cloth\r\nis well suited. When they are so used register marks should be added\r\nat numerous points on the map and the oversheet, including the four\r\ncomers, the color boundaries should be drawn or traced, and finally\r\nthe colors should be added. Two or more colors should not be used on\r\nany one area to modify a tone, but each area should be colored with a\r\nseparate crayon. Patterns or designs should not be used except to\r\nstrengthen contrasts, and for that purpose a pattern may be drawn with\r\na black pencil over a color.\r\n\r\nWATER COLORS.\r\n\r\nBy dilution to half strength some of the standard water colors will\r\nyield a tint or hue that will contrast with other tints or hues\r\nproduced in the same way quits as well as undiluted or full colors\r\nwill contrast with one another. The colors named below, except\r\nchrome-yellow and emerald-green, are among those that when diluted\r\nwill afford satisfactory contrasts among themselves and with their\r\nfull colors and are recommended for use in coloring original maps.\r\n\r\nMauve.              Hooker's green No. 2.\r\nCrimson lake.       Emerald-green.\r\nOrange-vermilion.   Payne's gray.\r\nBurnt sienna.       Lampblack.\r\nCadmium-yellow.     Sepia.\r\nChrome-yellow.      Cerulean blue.\r\nOlive-green.\r\n\r\nOther pigments spread better than cerulean blue and emerald-green, but\r\nthe exceptional purity of color of these two seems to warrant their\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE TRANSPARENT WATER COLORS.\r\n\r\nJapanese transparent water colors, so called, are used by some\r\ngeologists. They spread evenly and are convenient for field use, but\r\nthey can not be washed out like other water colors, so that when they\r\nare once applied to an area and a change of color becomes necessary\r\nthey must be bleached out. A good bleach is sodium hypochlorite, which\r\nshould be applied with a brush until the color disappears, and the\r\narea dried with a blotter before recoloring. Light tints of these\r\ncolors are believed to be somewhat fugitive if exposed to strong\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nCOLORING GEOLOGIC MAPS.\r\n\r\nThe colors used on most original maps are not pleasing, a fact that is\r\nof no particular importance, but--and this is of importance--they\r\noften fail to give clear distinctions; the separate areas can not\r\nalways be identified or distinguished with certainty. Again, some\r\ncolors are fugitive, and when laid on in light tints they disappear\r\nentirely or become uncertain. Much of the difficulty in identifying\r\nand discriminating colors on an author's original maps is due to the\r\npromiscuous mixing of colors. Many persons can not match or\r\ndiscriminate mixed or broken colors. Hence if the supply of a color\r\nproduced by mixing becomes exhausted and the attempt is made to\r\nduplicate it by a second mixture the two will probably fail to match.\r\nIt is therefore suggested that colors in full strength and colors\r\ndiluted to half strength be used instead of mixtures of two or more\r\npigments, so that one color in two strengths or tones can be employed\r\nto indicate areas that are to be distinguished. The colors listed on\r\npage 26 will give 24 satisfactory distinctions and will thus supply\r\nall demands for map coloring.\r\n\r\nTo insure satisfactory contrasts between colored areas on a map,\r\nunlike colors should be placed next to each other--that is, colors\r\nshould be placed together that are widely separated in the spectrum,\r\nsuch as yellow and mauve, red and green, blue and orange, burnt sienna\r\nand olive-green; not such as red and orange, blue and purple, orange\r\nand yellow, sepia and burnt sienna.\r\n\r\nA sufficient quantity of water and color pigment to be used for one\r\nformation area on a map should be stirred in a saucer until the\r\ndesired tint is produced before it is applied. To maintain the same\r\ntone properly the color should be well stirred every time the brush is\r\nfilled; if it is not stirred the brush will on the next dipping take\r\nup a lighter tint, because most pigments, especially those derived\r\nfrom minerals, tend to precipitate. When the colors are applied the\r\nmap should preferably be placed in a slightly inclined position, and\r\nthe coloring should be started at the upper boundaries of an area to\r\nbe colored, the well-filled brush being pulled toward the painter and\r\nWorked rapidly back and forth horizontally, the edges of the fresh\r\ncolor being kept wet. If the edges are allowed to dry, a hard line and\r\na smeared or uneven effect will be produced.\r\n\r\nA strong color should generally be used for small areas unless the map\r\nshows also large areas that must have the same color; lighter hues\r\nshould be used for large areas. Bright colors are best suited for\r\nareas of igneous rocks, dikes, and veins, and these may be reduced in\r\nstrength for the larger areas.\r\n\r\nThe Survey's color scheme (see p. 63) need not be applied at this\r\nstage of preparation, except in the most general way. Appropriate\r\nfinal colors can be best selected when the new map is made ready for\r\nengraving. In the author's original maps adequate color distinctions\r\nbetween areas are more important than the use of standard geologic\r\ncolors. Patterns should not be ruled in one color on an original map\r\nto indicate distinctions between different formations of the same age\r\nor period, because such patterns are difficult to produce by hand with\r\nproper uniformity except by engraving.\r\n\r\nIt is of vital importance that an original base map should be free\r\nfrom colors and from technical symbols in order that it may be kept\r\nclean for photographing and preserved for possible future use. Such a\r\nmap should preferably be photographed in order to obtain prints on\r\nwhich to add the colors and symbols; the use of an oversheet for this\r\npurpose is not nearly so satisfactory. When photographed a base map\r\nshould be reduced to publication scale in order to save the additional\r\ncost of a larger negative, and this reduced map may be made up for\r\npublication by the addition of colors and symbols, title, explanation,\r\netc.; but the lithographer will also need the original base map from\r\nwhich to make his reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGRAMS.\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe term \"diagrams,\" as used here, includes such illustrations as mine\r\nplans, profiles, sections, stereograms, and maps that are more\r\ndiagrammatic than cartographic. The first essential in the original\r\ndrawings for simple diagrams is clearness of copy. Simplicity of\r\nsubject does not warrant hasty preparation, for an original sketch\r\nthat has been carelessly drawn and is inaccurate or inconsistent in\r\ndetail may lead to serious errors. Ruled paper printed especially for\r\nplatting profiles and cross sections should be used. Curves or graphs\r\nmade by an author with pencil on blue-lined section paper may be inked\r\nby more skillful draftsmen. An author's pencil sketches are usually\r\nsatisfactory if they indicate plainly the facts to be represented, but\r\nthey should be prepared with some care as to detail. Tables and like\r\nmatter are not generally satisfactory material from which to prepare\r\ndrawings. In drawings for diagrams that are to be printed in the text\r\nas figures the use of large, solid black bars or of conspicuous areas\r\nof solid black is objectionable, because the black is likely to print\r\ngray and to appear uneven in tone. Ruled tints or cross lining give\r\nbetter effects. Stereograms should be prepared by an author with\r\nespecial care, for they represent facts only as the author sees them,\r\nand the author's view must be imparted to the draftsman graphically.\r\nThe \"third dimension\"--the relief--in such drawings is not easily\r\nexpressed and should be brought out clearly in the author's rough\r\nsketches.\r\n\r\nFor illustrations of apparatus photographs are preferred, but if rough\r\nsketches are submitted they should show not only correct relations but\r\nall dimensions.\r\n\r\nPLANS OF MINE WORKINGS.\r\n\r\nBlue prints obtained from mining companies are acceptable for plans of\r\nmines or underground workings, but all unnecessary or irrelevant\r\ndetails on such plans must be canceled and all essential features\r\nretained, and every essential feature, especially any added data, must\r\nbe clearly interpretable. Many such blue prints are so large and\r\nunwieldy that they must be greatly reduced by photography before they\r\ncan be redrawn. If the lines are too weak to photograph, a tracing of\r\nthe essential parts can be made and reduced to about twice publication\r\nsize. The shadowless drafting table, described on pages 47-48, is well\r\nadapted to the work of making such tracings. Blue prints can also be\r\npantographed to any convenient size if the details are not too minute\r\nor complex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Conventional lines used in preparing plans\r\nand diagrams of mine workings to distinguish different levels.]\r\n\r\nThe levels in plans of underground workings can be differentiated in\r\nfinished drawings by a system of conventional outlines in black, as\r\nshown in figure 2, by conventional patterns or symbols within plain\r\noutlines, or by colors. Such plans should not be printed in colors\r\nunless the maze of workings is so complex that lines showing the\r\ndifferent levels would become confused or obscure if printed in black.\r\n\r\nSECTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe standard forms of geologic sections are shown in the geologic\r\nfolios. Structure sections should be prepared with great care as to\r\ndetail but without attempt at refinement of lines and lettering. The\r\nauthor's drawing of a section along a line or zone that is not\r\ndefinitely indicated by a line on an accompanying map should be so\r\nprepared that it may be copied exactly. On the other hand, the\r\ndraftsman, in reproducing a section that represents the structure\r\nalong a given line or zone, may be able to make the outcrops coincide\r\nwith the topography and the formation boundaries shown on the map, but\r\nthe structure, or the interpretation of it to be given, should be\r\ncarefully worked out by the author. All essential facts relating to\r\nbedding, folding, faulting, crosscutting dikes and veins, or other\r\nsignificant details should be indicated with precision. No attempt\r\nneed be made to draw firm, steady lines so long as the essential facts\r\nare clearly expressed.\r\n\r\nAll sections should be drawn to scale, and both the vertical and the\r\nhorizontal scale should be given on the drawing. These scales should\r\nbe uniform if possible, or at least the vertical exaggeration should\r\nbe minimized. Too great vertical exaggeration creates distortion and\r\nis grossly misleading. Sections should be drawn to scale on ruled\r\npaper prepared for the use of authors. Such paper may be obtained on\r\nrequisition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Section and perspective view showing\r\nrelations of surface features to the different kinds of rock and the\r\nstructure of the beds.]\r\n\r\nA kind of cross section which is not often used but which gives a\r\nmore pictorial and clearer conception of underground relations than\r\nother kinds is made by adding a sketch of the topography above the\r\nsection. This sketch should be a perspective view, in which the\r\nprominent features shown hypothetically in the section below it will\r\nbe reflected in the topography. Such a sketch might show, for example,\r\nnot only monoclinal slopes, \"hogbacks\" due to steeply upturned beds,\r\nterraces, escarpments, and like features, but volcanic necks or other\r\nextruded masses in their true relations to the underground geology of\r\nthe country. (See fig, 3.) In submitting the draft of such an\r\nillustration the author should, if possible, submit also a sketch or\r\nphotographs of the adjacent country and indicate on the section the\r\npoint of view by notes such as \"Sketch A made at this point,\" \"See\r\nphotograph B.\" The sketch will be more useful if it is prepared on a\r\nscale consistent with the details of the section. It may be made with\r\na pencil and should show as well as possible the relations of the\r\nfeatures in the landscape to those in the section. Some good examples\r\nof illustrations of this type can be found in Powell's \"Exploration of\r\nthe Colorado River,\" pages 182-193. One simpler figure of the same\r\nkind is given on the cover of the geologic folios.\r\n\r\nIn preparing original drawings representing columnar sections, or\r\nsections in wells or ravines, the author should indicate all\r\nwell-defined or important local features of structure, such as\r\ncross-bedding, ore bodies, or lenses. If there are no unusual features\r\nor details, the subdivisions need be identified only by names of\r\nmaterials, such as \"thin-bedded limestone,\" or \"slates with some\r\ncoal,\" the coal beds being shown. The sections should, however, be so\r\nplotted and subdivided by the author that each section or group of\r\nsections will be complete in its crude form. The compilation of\r\nvarious parts into one unit and the construction of columnar sections\r\nby reference to tables alone is an essential part of the author's\r\noriginal preparation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Sections of coal beds. The Figure shows the\r\npublications size and the arrangement at the sections. Each section\r\nshould be drawn three-tenths or four-tenths of an inch wide and\r\nreduced one-half. Thicknesses can be indicated by numbers, as shown on\r\nsections 1 and 10, or by bar scale.]\r\n\r\nSections designed to show the relative thickness of beds of coal,\r\narranged in groups for publication either as plates or figures, should\r\nbe drawn in columns three or four tenths of an inch wide and reduced\r\none-half, as shown in figure 4. These sections, whether correlated or\r\nnot, should be drawn to some definite vertical scale and should show\r\nthe thickness of the coal beds, preferably by numbers indicating feet\r\nand inches, the other material being symbolized and the symbols\r\nexplained graphically, as shown in figure 4. The vertical scale should\r\nalways be stated for the use of the draftsman. A bar scale may be\r\nused instead of figures showing the dimensions of the individual beds.\r\n\r\nLITHOLOGIC SYMBOLS.\r\n\r\nThe symbols used to indicate the various kinds of rocks illustrated in\r\nsections and diagrams are shown in Plate III. The units or elements of\r\nthese symbols may be spaced more openly in generalized diagrammatic\r\nsections than in sections that show great detail.\r\n\r\nSymbols should be used consistently throughout a report, and in order\r\nto make them consistent a set showing the symbol to be used for each\r\nkind of rock to be indicated should be prepared before the original\r\ndrawings are made. Some inconsistencies may be unavoidable on account\r\nof the small size of some areas shown and the contrast needed between\r\nothers; but the deviations from the set of symbols adopted should be\r\nminimized.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF PHOTOGRAPHS AS ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of a good photographic print is a good negative, and\r\nthe best prints for reproduction as illustrations are those made from\r\nnegatives in which the illumination is evenly distributed and the\r\ndetails are sharp--such negatives as are obtainable only by the use of\r\nsmall stops and correct focusing. A good print should not present too\r\nsharp contrasts between its dark and its light parts; if it does, the\r\nprinted reproduction will show a loss of detail in both. Sufficiency\r\nof detail depends largely on focus, stopping down, and timing;\r\nbrilliancy is the direct result of ample illumination by sun or\r\nartificial light, without which a photograph will be dull or \"flat\"\r\nand generally unsatisfactory for reproduction. Bad weather may prevent\r\ngood field exposures, yet even in bad weather acceptable negatives may\r\nbe obtained by judicious focusing, stopping down, and timing. If a\r\nnegative is overexposed it may be full of detail, but flat and too\r\nthin to print well. If underexposed it will show no details in its\r\nlighter parts and the shadows will be black; and a black shadow is\r\nnothing less than a blemish. Some detail should appear in all shadows\r\nand in the middle tones, and some should appear in the high lights;\r\nand a print in which these are evenly developed and in which the\r\nillumination is distributed uniformly is technically perfect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately not all field photographs are good, so an author must\r\nselect from his collection those which will make the best half tones.\r\nIn making this selection he should of course consider, first, the\r\nscientific value of the photograph, and next, its pictorial or\r\nartistic quality, which, though of secondary importance, should\r\nnevertheless be kept in mind. A feature worthy of illustration\r\ndeserves good pictorial expression; if it is of superior scientific\r\ninterest it should not be represented by an inferior photograph.\r\nFortunately, a good, accurate drawing may be made from a poor\r\nphotograph, and a photographic view that has only minor defects can be\r\nsuccessfully retouched. Photographs that need much retouching should\r\ngenerally be larger than publication size, for the effects of\r\nretouching--brush marks, etc.--will be softened by reduction.\r\nPhotographs that need only slight retouching need not be larger than\r\npublication size. A photograph can rarely be satisfactorily enlarged\r\nin reproduction unless it is sharp in detail and requires no\r\nretouching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF ILLUSTRATIONS. PLATE III.\r\n\r\nLITHOLOGIC SYMBOLS USED IN STRUCTURE AND COLUMNAR SECTIONS TO\r\nREPRESENT DIFFERENT KINDS OF ROCK]\r\n\r\nUnmounted prints are always preferable for use in making\r\nillustrations. A group that is to form a single plate should be placed\r\nin an envelope bearing the number of the plate and its title, and each\r\nprint of the group should bear a corresponding number, written in\r\npencil on its back. The envelope will protect the prints and keep them\r\ntogether, and the numbers will identify them. Red ink should not be\r\nused to mark photographs, as it is likely to penetrate the coating or\r\neven the fiber of the paper, so that it can not be erased.\r\n\r\nIf a print is of doubtful quality two copies of it should be\r\nsubmitted--one glazed, the other having a dead finish or \"mat\"\r\nsurface, which is generally preferable if the print must be\r\nconsiderably retouched. The best prints for use as illustrations are\r\nthose made on \"regular\" or \"special\" semimat velox and glossy haloid\r\npapers. The author should indicate prints that may be grouped together\r\naccording to their relation geographically or by subject. Generally\r\ntwo half tones will be combined on a page, and the list of\r\nillustrations should be prepared accordingly.\r\n\r\nWith slight trimming and reduction, three photographs measuring 3-1/4\r\nby 5-1/2 inches may be made up one above the other to form a full-page\r\noctavo plate. Four photographs in which the longer dimensions\r\nrepresent vertical distances may sometimes be used if they are placed\r\nsidewise on the page, with side titles.\r\n\r\nSome photographs may be reduced to the width of a page by trimming\r\ninstead of by photographic reduction, which may involve loss of\r\ndetail. The author should clearly indicate the extent of such trimming\r\nas they may bear without loss of essential details. The trimming is\r\nbest done during the final preparation. A line should not be drawn\r\nacross a photograph to mark such trimming, but the position of the\r\nline or lines should be indicated either on temporary mounts, on the\r\nbacks of the prints, or by a statement, such as \"One inch may be cut\r\noff on right, one-fourth inch on left, and one-half inch at bottom.\"\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHTED PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nSection 4965 (ch. 3, title 60) of the Revised Statutes, amended by act\r\nof March 2, 1895 (Stat. L., vol. 28, p. 965), provides that no\r\ncopyrighted photograph may be used without the consent of the\r\nproprietor of the copyright in writing signed in the presence of two\r\nwitnesses. A penalty of $1 is imposed for every sheet on which such a\r\nphotograph is reproduced without consents, \"either printing, printed,\r\ncopied, published, imported, or exposed for sale.\" An author should\r\ntherefore obtain the written consent of the owner of a copyrighted\r\nphotograph to use it, and the letter giving this consent should be\r\nsubmitted with the illustration.\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nEvery photograph submitted with a manuscript should bear a memorandum\r\ngiving the name of the photographer or the owner of the negative. If\r\nthe negative is in the Survey's collection that fact should be stated,\r\nas \"Neg. Keith 318.\" The Survey receives many requests for copies of\r\nphotographs that have been reproduced as illustrations in its\r\npublications, and replies to these requests will be facilitated if the\r\nSurvey's number or the source of each photograph presented for use as\r\nan illustration is stated as above on the photograph.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENDING ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND DRAWINGS.\r\n\r\nA photograph that has been used in making a half-tone cut for a Survey\r\nreport can not be lent, but if the negative is on file a print can be\r\nfurnished at cost; and a Survey drawing that is well preserved can be\r\nphotographed and a print furnished, also at cost. Requests for such\r\nprints should be addressed to the Director.\r\n\r\nUNPUBLISHED PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nThe Survey can not issue a copy of an unpublished photograph except\r\nupon the written approval or requisition of the person under whose\r\nname the negative is filed. This requirement does not apply to a print\r\nneeded for official use, nor to a print made from an old negative\r\nreserved under the name of any present member of the Survey or from a\r\nnegative that has been released by the person under whose name it is\r\nfiled.\r\n\r\nAuthors using Survey photographs in unofficial publications are\r\nrequested to acknowledge the source of the photograph by adding to the\r\nprinted title such a statement as \"Photograph by U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey (David Whits).\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIMENS.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS.\r\n\r\nSpecimens other than fossils that are to be illustrated in a report\r\nshould be photographed before they are submitted, but the requisition\r\nfor the photographs should be initialed by the chief illustrator, who\r\nwill indicate the kinds of prints needed. Duplicate photographs of the\r\nspecimens should be made up into temporary plates by the author and\r\nsubmitted with his other illustrations, the specimens being retained\r\nsubject to call, if needed, when the illustrations are finally\r\nprepared. Should a colored illustration of a specimen be needed,\r\nhowever, the specimen must be submitted with the report, and a\r\ndifferent kind of print, preferably one made on platinum or other\r\nspecial paper, will be obtained by the section of illustrations.\r\n\r\nBORROWED AND FRAGILE SPECIMENS.\r\n\r\nIn submitting specimens to be illustrated an author should call\r\nattention to those that have been borrowed and to those that are\r\nfragile. Borrowed specimens will receive first attention, so that they\r\nmay be returned promptly.\r\n\r\nTRANSMITTAL OF PALEONTOLOGIC SPECIMENS.\r\n\r\nAll requests for paleontologic illustrations should be addressed to\r\nthe Director. The letter of transmittal should state the title of the\r\npaper, the form of publication desired (bulletin, professional paper,\r\nor monograph), and the status of the manuscript, whether completed or\r\nin preparation. If the paper is unfinished an estimate of the number\r\nof illustrations required should be given, and the special reasons for\r\nprompt preparation should be fully stated. A letter transmitting a\r\nsecond or third lot of fossils should refer to the preceding lot or\r\nlots if all the fossils are to be used in illustrating the same paper.\r\n\r\nFossils that are to be drawn should be sent directly to the section\r\nof illustrations, but those that are to be photographed and require\r\nunusual posing or that are extremely delicate and valuable may be sent\r\ndirectly to the photographic laboratory to avoid repeated handling.\r\nEach specimen or, if it is very small, each box or bottle containing a\r\nspecimen should be numbered, and each lot should be accompanied by a\r\nlist giving their names and numbers. Full instructions as to size of\r\nreproduction, together with sketches showing the point of view\r\npreferred and any special features to be displayed should also be\r\nsubmitted. All specimens that show strong colors and all groups of\r\nspecimens that are not uniform in color will be coated by holding them\r\nin the vapor of ammonium chloride unless directions to the contrary\r\nare given by the author of the paper. As it may not be desirable to\r\napply this process to soft or fragile specimens or to specimens that\r\nhave been borrowed an author should indicate any specimens that may\r\nnot be so treated. Specimens whose color aids in revealing detail are\r\nnot so coated. If any features of a specimen are unusual that fact\r\nshould be stated so that the photographer and the retoucher may\r\nperform their work according to the requirements.\r\n\r\nMAKING UP PLATES.\r\n\r\nTwo or more illustrations may be combined to form one plate in order\r\nto permit easy and close comparison as well as for economy, for if a\r\nparticular illustration is too small to make a full plate and is not\r\nsuitable for enlargement other illustrations that are closely related\r\nto it may be put on the same plate. The size of the printed page as\r\ngiven in the table on page 11 will determine the size of the plate.\r\n\r\nIn making up plates composed of a number of figures the author should\r\nendeavor to group related figures together and at the same time to\r\nobserve proper regard for artistic effect, but as figures vary in size\r\nand shape a grouping according to relations may not be possible in\r\nsome plates. If related figures can not be kept together the larger\r\nand darker figures should be placed in the lower part of the plate and\r\nthe smaller and lighter above. If a plate consists of one large figure\r\nand several smaller ones the large figure should be placed below and\r\nthe smaller figures above.\r\n\r\nA number designating a figure should be placed immediately below the\r\nfigure, and a series of such numbers should preferably begin with 1 in\r\nthe upper left corner and continue consecutively across and down\r\nthrough the plate. This arrangement is not always possible, however,\r\non account of variations in the size of figures.\r\n\r\nAs drawings of fossils or other specimens are prepared separately and\r\ngrouped into plates, and as most paleontologists make up their own\r\nplates, each in his own way, there is naturally great dissimilarity in\r\nmethods and in results. Ordinary white or light-gray cardboard should\r\nbe used, and the figures that are to make up a plate should be\r\narranged as stated above but not securely pasted until the grouping is\r\nsatisfactory. In trimming each drawing or photograph the author should\r\nbe careful to leave room at its lower edge for the number. Small\r\ndrawings or photographs, such as paleontologists use, when pasted on\r\nbristol board or other board faced with tough paper are difficult or\r\nimpossible to remove without injury if they have to be remounted;\r\nfigures pasted on ordinary white or gray cardboard can be removed\r\nwithout difficulty. Each plate should be made up in a size to fit the\r\nvolume or in its correct proportion to a page in the volume in which\r\nit is to be used (see table on p. 11), and each figure should be\r\nproperly oriented--that is, all vertical lines, or the vertical axis\r\nof each specimen, should be parallel with the sides of the plate. When\r\nthe figures are being mounted care should be taken that the mucilage\r\nor paste does not exude under pressure and cover any part of the\r\ndrawing or photograph. The same attention should be given to pasting\r\non numbers. Inattention to these details may produce results that\r\nwill affect the reproduction of the plates.\r\n\r\nOrdinary mucilage may be used for mounting drawings and photographs,\r\nbut photo paste gives good results and is perhaps cleaner to handle.\r\nDry-mounting tissue is well adapted to mounting single illustrations\r\nbut not groups of figures. Liquid rubber is sometimes used, but it is\r\nnot suitable for mounting small figures, such as drawings and\r\nphotographs of fossils. It can be used satisfactorily for mounting\r\ntemporary plates and for mounting photographs in albums and on large\r\ncards for study or exhibition; but it has not proved to be a permanent\r\nadhesive. Its special merit is that it does not cause either the\r\nphotograph or the mounting sheet to warp. It is applied by spreading\r\nit evenly over the back of the photograph with the fingers. The\r\nsuperfluous rubber can easily be removed from the hands and from the\r\ncards or sheets when it is dry. Anything mounted with liquid rubber\r\ncan be easily removed.\r\n\r\nIf a plate is to be made up of a small number of figures that require\r\ndifferent reductions, the author, instead of mounting or pasting the\r\nseparate figures on one card in the manner already indicated, may draw\r\na rectangle of the size of the printed plate and sketch within it the\r\nseveral figures in their respective sizes and positions. These \"dummy\"\r\nplates or layouts should be numbered as plates, and they may bear\r\ncaptions and titles. The photographs or drawings represented by the\r\nsketches should then be numbered to identify them with the sketches on\r\nthe dummy plate, and those that pertain to each plate should be\r\ninclosed in an envelope attached to the dummy plate. A plate made up\r\nin this manner will meet every requirement of the photo-engraver or\r\nlithographer.\r\n\r\nIf a paleontologist so desires, his plates can be permanently made up\r\nafter he has transmitted his material, but he should always submit a\r\ntentative arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREUSE OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf an author desires to use in modified form an illustration already\r\npublished, whether by the Geological Survey or by an outside\r\npublisher, he should furnish a print or tracing of the illustration\r\nshowing the changes desired. If the illustration is not to be modified\r\nhe need only give the title of the volume in which it was used, with\r\nthe number of the page, figure, or plate, and he need not make a\r\nsketch of the illustration or furnish a dummy; but its title should be\r\nquoted and proper reference should be given in the list of\r\nillustrations. Due credit should be given to the author or publisher.\r\n\r\nThe original cuts of illustrations will be kept for one year after the\r\nreport for which they were made has been published, and authors of\r\nlater reports may and should reuse, whenever practicable, any such\r\ncut that will serve as an illustration. In the author's list of\r\nillustrations such a cut should be referred to by its number as plate\r\nor figure and the volume in which it was first used.\r\n\r\nAn electrotype of any cut on hand will be furnished for use in\r\npublications other than those of the Geological Survey at the cost of\r\nmaking, which is 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 cents a square inch of printing\r\nsurface. The minimum charge for a single electrotype ranges from 46 to\r\n60 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPROVAL OF FINISHED ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the drawings for a report have been prepared they will be\r\nsubmitted to the author or to the chief of his branch or division for\r\nexamination. The finished drawings will be accompanied by the\r\n\"originals,\" with which the author should carefully and thoroughly\r\ncompare them. After making a thorough comparison he should mark\r\nlightly with a pencil, on the finished drawings, all necessary\r\ncorrections, or indicate his approval subject to such corrections and\r\nadditions as may be required. He should verify all type matter and\r\nother lettering and assure himself that no mistakes have been made in\r\ngrouping the photographs into plates, especially such as have been\r\nregrouped since they left his hands. The author's list of\r\nillustrations will be submitted with the new drawings for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVISION OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll illustrations receive editorial revision before they are sent to\r\nthe engravers. After they are drawn they are examined with reference\r\nto their scientific features and their accuracy, and then in turn with\r\nreference to the correctness of geologic names and geographic names\r\nand to errors in statement and in spelling. Each illustration thus,\r\nbefore it is completed, receives critical examination by persons\r\nqualified in particular kinds of work to detect errors or omissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBMITTAL OF PROOFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first proofs of all illustrations are submitted to an author when\r\nhe is within reach, but if he is in the field and the transmittal of\r\nthe proofs to him is likely to cause too much delay they are submitted\r\nto the chief of the branch or division in which the report was\r\nprepared. Second proofs of the more complicated illustrations,\r\nparticularly geologic maps, may be submitted. An author's examination\r\nshould be confined principally to the revision of the scientific\r\nfeatures of his illustrations, but suggestions as to general\r\neffectiveness are always acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe process to be used in engraving each illustration is stamped in\r\nits lower left corner. In examining proofs an author should note the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\n1. Changes can not be made in zinc etchings except by eliminating\r\nparts, cutting away defects, and connecting lines. If additions are\r\nrequired reengraving is generally necessary, and reengraving should\r\npreferably be avoided.\r\n\r\n2. Changes can be made in half-tone plates only by re-etching certain\r\nparts to make them lighter and by burnishing certain parts to make\r\nthem darker. If the proof shows a general loss of detail the fault may\r\nlie either in the proving of the cut or in the reproduction. If it is\r\nin the reproduction it can not be remedied without reengraving. A\r\nslight loss of detail may be expected in all half tones, especially in\r\nthose that are smaller than the copy submitted.\r\n\r\n3. Minor changes can be made in photolithographs and\r\nchromolithographs, but changes can not be made twice in one place\r\nwithout danger of affecting the printing. It is customary to approve\r\nall lithographic proofs subject to the corrections indicated, the\r\nprinted edition being examined and compared, but if the changes are\r\nnumerous and radical second proofs may be required. Second combined\r\nproofs of chromolithographs are very expensive. (See p. 89.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOF READING ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn author should examine the proofs of his illustrations closely and\r\nshould compare them carefully with the original drawings. A mere\r\ncursory examination may fail to detect errors that have not been\r\ncaught by the regular proof reader. Every correction desired should be\r\nclearly indicated with pen and ink in the body of the proof and\r\ninclosed in a loop from which a line should be carried to a marginal\r\nnote or comment, but if the time available is short a pencil may be\r\nused. In correcting type matter or lettering (such as that in a\r\ngeologic legend or explanation) the ordinary proof reader's marks\r\nshould be used. The author or the person examining the proofs should\r\ninitial each one at the place indicated by a rubber stamp.\r\n\r\nProofs should be held only long enough to examine them properly and to\r\ncompare them with the original illustrations, for a time limit is\r\nfixed in each contract for engraving, and if the author holds proofs\r\nbeyond a reasonable time he causes a delay in the fulfillment of the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nAs the illustrations for many reports contain important data that will\r\nbe discussed in the text, proofs of illustrations can not be supplied\r\nto any applicant without consent from the Director's office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following requirements are essential to obtain good original\r\nillustrations:\r\n\r\n1. The material selected should be pertinent and expressive; it\r\nshould have the qualities essential to good illustrations.\r\n\r\n2. The character of the report and the size of the illustrations\r\nshould be kept clearly in mind. If the report is preliminary or\r\nephemeral the illustrations should be simple and inexpensive. If the\r\nreport represents the sum of knowledge on the subject treated or the\r\nlast word on some particular area the illustrations may be more\r\nelaborate. The character of a report generally determines the form of\r\npublication, which, in turn, determines the size of the pages and the\r\nsize of the plates and figures. Every sketch made should be larger\r\nthan publication size--preferably twice publication size--whether it\r\nis a simple diagram or a base map.\r\n\r\n3. The kind of reproduction that is apparently needed should be fully\r\nconsidered, for it should have some relation to the kind of report.\r\nThe illustrations for short-lived reports are reproduced by the\r\ncheaper processes. Those for hurried reports are reproduced by\r\nprocesses that can be worked quickly, but no process should be\r\nconsidered that will not give a clear reproduction of essential\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n4. Clearness of preparation of original matter is invariably\r\nessential. An author should not expect the draftsmen or the editors to\r\nsupply missing links. Each original should be complete and should be\r\nso made that it can be understood and followed without question.\r\nChanges made in the finished drawings or on proof sheets are expensive\r\nand delay publication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. PREPARATION BY DRAFTSMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of preparing illustrations such as are used in the reports of\r\nthe Geological Survey is essentially that of making finished drawings\r\nfrom more or less crude and imperfect material furnished by authors to\r\nillustrate certain features or phenomena discussed in their\r\nmanuscripts. Each finished drawing must be so prepared that it can be\r\nreproduced in multiple by one of several processes of engraving. The\r\nauthor's sketches and other material are commonly called \"originals\";\r\nthe finished illustrations are known by the engravers as \"copy.\"\r\nThough most engraver's copy consists of more or less elaborate\r\ndrawings that are to be reproduced in facsimile by \"direct\" processes\r\nwithout the interposition of handwork, some of it consists of more\r\nroughly prepared copy which is accurate in statement but requires\r\ncomplete manual or \"indirect\" reproduction. The direct processes in\r\nuse are zinc etching, half-tone engraving, photolithography,\r\nthree-color half tone, photogravure, and photogelatin. The manual or\r\nindirect processes are wax engraving, wood engraving, engraving on\r\ncopper and on stone, plain lithography, and chromolithography. These\r\nprocesses are described on pages 72-90.\r\n\r\nPart I of this pamphlet contains some matter that is pertinent to\r\nfinal preparation and should be consulted by draftsmen.\r\n\r\nTo prepare a drawing that will be in every way suitable for\r\nreproduction usually requires experience of a kind not acquired in\r\nmany other kinds of drafting, such as preparing engineers' or\r\narchitects' drawings, because the drawings themselves or blue prints\r\nmade directly from them are the things the engineer or the architect\r\ndesires. Drawings prepared for reproduction are generally made larger\r\nthan publication size, and it is therefore necessary to gage each\r\nline, letter, or feature for a definite reduction. Engineers' and\r\narchitects' drawings generally do not require preparation for\r\nreproduction by any process, but in preparing illustrations for the\r\nreports of the Geological Survey reproduction must be fully considered\r\nat every step, and each drawing must be made according to the\r\nrequirements of a certain selected process and gaged for a certain\r\nreduction. The draftsman should therefore know how to plan each\r\ndrawing step by step for an engraved cut, a lithograph, a text figure,\r\nor a plate, always with a definite result in view. He should be\r\nfamiliar with processes of engraving and should know the special\r\nrequirements of each process, and he should be able to prepare\r\ndrawings for any specified reduction in a way to insure good, legible\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nThe geologic draftsman should read and study such textbooks of geology\r\nas those of Dana and Geikie and should familiarize himself with\r\nstructural geology, the geologic time divisions, and geologic\r\nnomenclature. He should be able to prepare a simple, effective\r\nillustration from complicated rough originals and to supply minor\r\nmissing essential parts or features. To perform his work successfully\r\nhe must possess mechanical skill and some artistic taste, as well as\r\ngood eyesight and great patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list of draftsmen's instruments is practically complete.\r\nThose which are considered indispensable are marked by asterisks; the\r\nothers may be used according to individual preference. The same kind\r\nof instrument may be duplicated in different sizes according to the\r\nvariation in the demands of the work.\r\n\r\n   Air brush and connections.

No. 3202.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF MATERIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe draftsman handling the drawings and other original material\r\nsubmitted by the author of a report for its illustration should first\r\ngroup them, as far as possible, into kinds or classes, in order that\r\nhe may decide how each illustration should be prepared (1) to express\r\nmost effectively the author's purpose, (2) to insure reasonable\r\neconomy in preparation and in reproduction, and (3) to meet the\r\nrequirements of the processes of reproduction selected. All similar\r\nillustrations for one publication should be prepared in the same\r\ngeneral style. In a series of geologic sections, for example, the same\r\nlithologic symbols should be used throughout for the same kinds of\r\nrocks. The titles, explanations, and captions of the maps should also\r\nagree with one another in general style and in details of workmanship.\r\n\r\nThe draftsman should determine in advance the reduction for each\r\ndrawing or for each group of drawings, in order that he may use the\r\nsame size of letters or the same kinds of type for the lettering on a\r\nseries of drawings that require the same reduction. The reduction\r\nshould preferably be marked in fractions (as \"1/2 off,\" \"1/4 off\" or\r\n\"reduce 1/2,\" \"reduce 1/4\"), and the choice of the same reduction for\r\na group of drawings will not only insure greater uniformity in the\r\ndrafting and in the reproduction but will permit the drawings to be\r\nreproduced more economically, for the engraver can photograph them in\r\ngroups instead of each one separately.\r\n\r\nThe draftsman should therefore note and consider (1) the special\r\nfeatures shown in the author's originals; (2) whether or not these\r\nfeatures have been plainly indicated and whether the originals are\r\ncomplete; (3) the size of the printed page of the volume in which the\r\nillustrations will appear and the reduction required for each drawing;\r\nand (4) the process by which each drawing should be reproduced. If an\r\noriginal is of doubtful or uncertain interpretation or appears to be\r\nincomplete the draftsman should confer with the author of the paper if\r\nhe is within reach or should bring the matter to the attention of the\r\nchief of the branch; otherwise he may waste much time in making the\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF MAPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECTION.\r\n\r\nThe base maps furnished by authors (see pp. 13-14) are prepared in\r\nmany different ways and in different degrees of refinement and of\r\ncrudity, but the work of redrawing them for reproduction involves\r\nwell-established and generally uniform principles. All maps except\r\nthose of very extensive areas should be based on a map projection\r\nwhich will show with a minimum of distortion the effect of the\r\ncurvature of the earth. The polyconic projection (see fig. 5) is used\r\nfor most Government maps. In this projection the central meridian is\r\na straight vertical line, and each parallel of latitude is developed\r\nindependently of the others. The mathematical elements of map\r\nprojection are given in tables published by the Geological Survey[6]\r\nand the Coast and Geodetic Survey.[7] Figure 5, however, illustrates\r\nthe mechanical or constructional features of the polyconic projection\r\nand if used in connection with the published tables will probably be\r\na sufficient guide for projecting a map on any desired scale.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Gannett, S. S., Geographic tables and formulas, 4th ed.:\r\nU. S. Geol. Survey Bull. 650, 1916. See also Gannett, Henry, Manual of\r\ntopographic methods: U. S. Geol. Survey Bull. 307, pp. 85-86, 1906.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Methods and results: Tables for the projection of maps\r\nand polyconic development; Appendix No. 6, Report for 1884; Tables for\r\na polyconic projection of maps, based upon Clarke's reference spheroid\r\nof 1886; 3d ed., 1910.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--Diagram illustrating method of projecting a\r\nmap.]\r\n\r\nIn projecting a map first select a convenient measuring scale for\r\nsetting off the dimensions given in the tables, or if no scale is at\r\nhand one may be constructed. Measuring scales are made, however,\r\nbearing divisions for miles and kilometers and finer subdivisions of 6\r\nto 100 parts. They include the ratios of 1:31,250, 1:31,680, 1:48,000,\r\n1:62,500, 1:63,360, 1:125,000, 1:250,000, 1:500,000, 1:1,000,000, and\r\nothers. On a map drawn on the scale of 1 to 63,360, for example, 1\r\ninch would represent 1 mile; on a map drawn on the scale of 1 to\r\n1,000,000, 1 millimeter would represent 1 kilometer, and so on. It\r\nwill be seen that the use of a scale that shows in ratios, such as\r\nthose just given, the actual distance on the ground as compared with\r\nthe unit representing the same distance on the map will reduce the\r\npossibility of error.\r\n\r\nThe method of projecting a map, illustrated in the accompanying\r\ndiagram (fig. 5), is as follows: First draw a straight vertical line\r\n(A) through the middle of the sheet to represent the central meridian\r\nof the map and a line (B) at the lower end of this line exactly at\r\nright angles to it to represent the bottom of the map. Then set off on\r\nthe line showing the central meridian the distances between parallels\r\ngiven in Table 6 on page 36 of \"Geographic tables and formulas\" (Bull.\r\n650). It should be noted that the figures in these tables give the\r\ndistance, in meters and statute miles, of 1° on a meridian measured\r\n30' each way from a point where the meridian is intersected by a\r\nparallel. The exact distances between parallels as measured on the\r\nground are given in the Coast and Geodetic Survey tables, or they may\r\nbe computed from Table 6 of \"Geographic tables and formulas\" by adding\r\nthe sum of the figures given for any two latitudes 1° apart and\r\ndividing by 2.\r\n\r\nThe distance between parallels that are 2° apart, as shown in the\r\ndiagram, may be computed from Table 6 of \"Geographic tables and\r\nformulas,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   Meters.         Meters.\r\n\r\n1° of latitude on 37th parallel = 100,975.1 / 2 =  55,487.5\r\n1° of latitude on 36th parallel                 = 110,956.2\r\n1° of latitude on 35th parallel = 110,937.6 / 2 =  55,468.8\r\n                                                  ---------\r\nTrue distance from 35° to 37° latitude          = 221,912.5\r\n\r\nThe distances given in the diagram were obtained by adding the figures\r\ngiven in the Coast and Geodetic Survey tables, which yield the same\r\nresults. Other tables in Bulletin 650 give the true distances in\r\ninches on maps of certain standard scales.\r\n\r\nThrough the points thus obtained on the central meridian draw lines at\r\nright angles to the vertical line. Along these horizontal lines lay\r\noff the dimensions in the column headed X, Table 6 (pp. 39-47) of\r\n\"Geographic tables and formulas\" as required for each individual\r\nmap--in the diagram every alternate degree. Draw vertical lines at\r\nthese points and set off the distance Y in the same table in a similar\r\nmanner, and the points so found will be the points of intersection of\r\nthe respective meridians and parallels. Figures are given on the\r\ndiagram for the thirty-fifth parallel only.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETAILS OF BASE MAPS.\r\n\r\nAnyone who attempts to draw a base map must, first of all, know how\r\neach feature or part of the map should be represented. Most of the\r\nconventional symbols for features shown on base maps are well\r\nestablished and should invariably be used; for instance, a line\r\ncomposed of alternate long and short dashes (not dashes and dots)\r\nrepresents a county boundary, and a line or two parallel lines across\r\nwhich short lines are drawn at regular intervals represents a\r\nrailroad. If he finds that two or more symbols have been widely used\r\nto represent the same feature the draftsman should select the one that\r\nis best suited to the map in hand. The correct forms of the\r\nconventional symbols or features to be used in preparing miscellaneous\r\nmaps are shown in Plate IV, but the size and weight of each line or\r\nsymbol must depend on the size and character of the map.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSFERRING OF COPYING.\r\n\r\nTRACING.\r\n\r\nThe oldest method of transferring a map or parts of a map or other\r\ndrawing to another sheet is that of copying it by means of tracing\r\npaper. This method, though still used for simple work, has given way\r\nto quicker and more effective methods. By one of these methods a piece\r\nof thin, fairly smooth paper (not necessarily transparent) is coated\r\nwith graphite by rubbing over it a soft pencil. When the graphite has\r\nbeen evenly distributed over it, this sheet is laid upon the drawing\r\npaper, coated side down, the map or other subject to be copied is laid\r\nupon the graphite-coated sheet, and the two outer sheets--the drawing\r\npaper and the map--are securely fastened together. By a steel tracing\r\npoint or very hard pencil the lines and other details of the matter to\r\nbe copied are then firmly and carefully traced and thus transferred to\r\nthe clean drawing paper beneath.\r\n\r\nFor maps that show several features in different colors sheets rubbed\r\nwith blue, orange, brown, or green pencils may be used, one after\r\nanother, for tracing each set of the features. Red should not be used,\r\nas it is not easily erased. This method insures distinctive lines for\r\nthe separate features and prevents the confusion that might result\r\nfrom the use of one color only. Exact register of the features shown\r\nin the several colors used may be insured by fastening one edge of the\r\ndrawing to be copied to the drawing paper by mucilage or thumb tacks.\r\nThe colored sheets may then be slipped in and out without altering the\r\nposition of the lines or symbols for one set of data with relation to\r\nthose for the others.\r\n\r\nIn the final preparation of a base map to be engraved and printed in\r\ncolors--for example, black, blue, and brown--tracings of the three\r\ncolors appearing on the original base should generally be transferred,\r\nas described above, to one sheet of paper and thus worked up into a\r\nthree-colored map. It is usually unnecessary and undesirable to draw\r\neach color on a separate sheet. The preparation of separate drawings\r\nmay facilitate reproduction, but if they are made on tracing cloth the\r\nusual uneven shrinking or stretching of the cloth may produce\r\nmisregister in the printing; therefore it is safer to make a single\r\ndrawing, so that the photolithographer can make three negatives and\r\nseparate the colors by painting out or \"opaquing\" the colors not\r\nwanted on each negative. A map drawn on a single sheet is also less\r\nbulky and can therefore be more conveniently handled and compared with\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason separate tracings for the different colors to be\r\nused on a map are considered desirable they should be made on linen\r\ncut from one roll and in the same direction according to the warp and\r\nwoof.\r\n\r\nCELLULOID TRANSFERRING.\r\n\r\nIn the celluloid method of transferring a map or parts of a map to\r\npaper upon which a complete new map is to be drawn the map or part of\r\nthe map to be copied is photographed to the exact scale of the new\r\ndrawing and reproduced in graphite on thin sheets of celluloid.\r\n\r\nThe celluloid sheet is then laid face down in the correct position on\r\nthe drawing paper and firmly rubbed on the back with a steel\r\nburnisher, which makes a perfect offset of the map on the paper. After\r\nthe parts desired are inked over the rest of the graphite print is\r\neasily erased with an ordinary rubber.\r\n\r\nBy using this method it is possible to get absolute scale and more\r\nsatisfactory results than by tracing over a photographic print line\r\nfor line or by using a pantograph.\r\n\r\nRequisitions for celluloid prints are made on the form used for\r\nrequesting photolithographic work.\r\n\r\nSKETCHING BY RETICULATION.\r\n\r\nIf the sheet bearing the design or matter to be copied may be marred\r\nwithout objection it is ruled lightly into pencil squares of equal\r\nsize. Corresponding squares of the same size, larger, or smaller,\r\naccording to the size of the new drawing, are then ruled on the\r\ndrawing paper, and the work is sketched square by square. If the\r\noriginal sheet may not be marred the same result can be obtained by\r\ndrawing the lines on a transparent oversheet. This method is\r\nserviceable for enlarging or reducing simple work that includes no\r\ngreat amount of detail; if great precision of detail is required the\r\noriginal should be enlarged or reduced by photography or by the\r\npantograph.\r\n\r\nTHE \"SHADOWLESS DRAFTING TABLE.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful contrivances that has been made for tracing a\r\ndrawing on the same scale is called by its manufacturers the\r\n\"shadowless drafting table.\" The essential features of this table are\r\na wooden box inclosing strong incandescent lights and bearing a\r\nground-glass top. A drawing placed on the ground glass can be so\r\nilluminated as to make its lines conspicuous and readily traceable\r\neven through relatively thick paper. The table is particularly useful\r\nfor tracing sheets upon, which the lines are indistinct and would not\r\nbe discernible under tracing paper with reflected light. It is also\r\nuseful in preparing drawings in which certain features must register\r\nperfectly over each other. In fact any drawing that does not require\r\nenlarging or reducing can be traced with great facility by the use of\r\nthis drafting table, and it is particularly useful for tracing faint\r\nlines on old and poorly preserved prints or drawings.\r\n\r\nSuch a table has been installed in the section of illustrations, where\r\nit can be used by authors and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES.\r\n\r\nRELIEF.\r\n\r\nThe effect of relief is expressed on a map by three methods--by\r\ncontours, by hachures, and by shading. (See fig. 6.) The first method\r\ndoes not give pronounced pictorial expression of relief, though it\r\ngives correct shape and exact elevation; the others are mow pictorial,\r\nbut they do not give exact elevation.\r\n\r\n_Contours._--As contoured maps are originally prepared from actual\r\nsurveys the draftsman should simply follow the copy furnished by the\r\ntopographer or such original matter as may be given to him for\r\nredrawing. If the area mapped is large and the contours are close\r\ntogether the original may be transferred by celluloid tracing (see p.\r\n47), or it may be transferred by tracing with graphite-coated paper\r\n(see p. 46). After the contour lines have been transferred they should\r\nbe traced in ink, in lines of even thickness, except those that\r\nrepresent certain fixed intervals and are to be numbered, which should\r\nbe made slightly thicker. (See fig. 6, A.) In drawing these lines some\r\ndraftsmen use an ordinary ruling pen, others the swivel pen; but\r\nconsiderable practice is required in the use of either before it can\r\nbe controlled to follow precisely the penciled lines. Still other\r\ndraftsmen use the Shepard pen or an ordinary drawing pen. The swivel\r\npen, if expertly handled, produces a firm and even line.\r\n\r\nItalic numbers should be used to indicate the elevation of a contour\r\nand should be placed in an opening in the line, never between lines.\r\nWhere the lines run close together great care should be taken that\r\nthey do not touch unless the interspaces are so narrow that they must\r\ntouch and combine. The lines should be firm and even, and if the copy\r\nor original map shows that they are uniformly very close together it\r\nshould be enlarged before the tracing is made in order to give more\r\nfreedom in drawing; but if the enlarged map is to be much reduced care\r\nshould be taken to make the lines proportionate to the reduction. A\r\nphoto-engraving of a map on which the contour lines are drawn very\r\nclose together is likely to be unsatisfactory because, though the\r\nspaces between the lines are reduced in width, the lines themselves\r\nmay show no corresponding reduction in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--Methods of expressing relief: (A) by contour\r\nlines, (B) by hachures, (C) by shading on stipple board, and (D) by a\r\nbrush drawing. The four examples given represent the same area. The\r\ndrawings were made twice the size of the printed cuts.]\r\n\r\nCertain contour lines are commonly accentuated on a map, generally\r\nevery fourth or fifth line--that is, for a 10-foot interval every\r\n50-foot line, for a 20-foot interval every 100-foot line, for a\r\n25-foot interval every 100-foot line, for a 50-foot interval every\r\n250-foot line, and for a 100-foot interval every 500-foot line.\r\n\r\n_Hachuring._--The effect of relief can be produced satisfactorily by\r\nhachuring but only by a draftsman who has had considerable\r\nwell-directed practice in that kind of drawing. In a hachured map the\r\nlight should seem to come from the west or northwest--that is, the\r\ndarker parts should be on the east or southeast side of an elevation\r\nand the lighter parts on the west or northwest The highest elevation\r\nshould be represented by the darkest shade on the right and by a\r\ncorresponding high light on the left. The hachuring should begin at\r\nthe crest of a peak, range, or butte and be worked downward toward the\r\ngentler slopes, the lines being drawn farther apart and made thinner\r\nuntil the floor of the valley is reached and the effect of shadow is\r\nlost by fewer and lighter lines. On a hachured map that is made from a\r\ncontoured map somewhat definite differences of elevation may be\r\nindicated by the intervals between the strokes, and abrupt changes in\r\nslope may be indicated by shorter and heavier lines. The strokes\r\nshould be disjointed, and they should trend at right angles to the\r\nupper margin of a cliff and should radiate from a peak. Figure 6, B,\r\nrepresents satisfactory hachuring.\r\n\r\n_Hill shading._--Relief is more easily expressed by shading than by\r\nhachuring. (See fig. 6, C, D.) The draftsman can best express it by\r\nthis means after he has studied contoured maps or photographs of the\r\nregion mapped, if they are available, in order that he may obtain an\r\nidea of the details of its topography.\r\n\r\nThe special means used to produce hill shading will depend on the\r\ncharacter of surface of the paper on which the drawing is to be made,\r\nthe size of the map, the amount of detail and refinement of execution\r\ndesired, and the amount of reduction to be made in reproducing the\r\ndrawing. For maps on which it is desired to show some refinement of\r\ndrawing and detail, a lithographic or wax crayon can be used on paper\r\nwhich has a grained surface. The draftsman must express relief\r\naccording to the information he has at hand, whether detailed or\r\ngeneral, and must employ methods that accord with the purpose of the\r\nmap and the mode of reproduction selected. If a shaded relief map is\r\nto be prepared for direct reproduction by photolithography and the\r\nshading is to be printed in a separate color the base map should be\r\ncompleted first and a light photographic or blue print obtained on\r\nwhich to add the relief in black lithographic crayon, to insure\r\nperfect fitting of the relief and the base; or the relief can be\r\nprepared on an oversheet--a semitransparent white paper with\r\nsufficient \"tooth\" or grain to cut the shading up into minute dots.\r\nThe shadowless drafting table (see p. 47) is especially useful for\r\nthis purpose. On this oversheet register marks should be placed at the\r\nfour comers and at several other points, particularly at the\r\nintersection of parallels and meridians.\r\n\r\nFor relief shading on small black and white maps Ross's hand-stipple\r\ndrawing paper may be used. (See p. 24.) By rubbing a black wax crayon\r\nor pencil over the surface of the paper the desired effect is produced\r\nin fine dots or in stipple, which may be varied in density of shade at\r\nthe will of the draftsman. (See fig. 6, C.) High lights can be\r\nproduced by scraping away the chalky surface of the paper. A\r\nlithographic or wax crayon is the best medium to use on this stipple\r\npaper, as on the paper referred to in the preceding paragraph, for the\r\nshading produced by it is not so easily smeared as that produced in\r\npastel or by a graphite pencil. The object of using either the rough\r\npaper or Boss's stipple paper for drawings that are to be reproduced\r\nby photo-engraving is to produce a shading that is broken up into dots\r\nof varying sizes, which is essential in such reproduction.\r\n\r\nBelief shading for maps can also be made with a brush in flat washes\r\nof either india ink or lampblack. Such shading should be made only\r\nover a blue print or an impression of some kind from the map upon\r\nwhich the shading or relief is to be overprinted. If the relief is\r\nexpressed on the author's original by contours the general shapes of\r\nthe relief and the drainage lines can be traced and transferred\r\nlightly in blue lines to form a base on which to model the shading and\r\nat the same time to make the shading fit the streams. Such a drawing\r\ncan be photographed through a screen and reproduced by half tone (see\r\nfig. 6, D) or mezzotint as a separate plate made to overprint the map\r\nin another color.\r\n\r\nHYDROGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n_General directions._--The drainage features of a map should be so\r\ndrawn as to suggest the natural courses of the streams. Streams should\r\nnot be drawn in straight, hard lines, as such lines are decidedly\r\nunnatural and produce a crude effect. The course of a river may be\r\nstraight in general, but it is likely to be somewhat sinuous in\r\ndetail. If the streams shown on a preliminary map are drawn in a\r\nclumsy or characterless fashion they should be redrawn with a freehand\r\neffect or made slightly wavy, in order that they may appear more\r\nnatural. The gradual widening of streams from source to mouth should\r\nalso be shown in the drawing. On small-scale maps, where the eye can\r\nat once see a stream through its full length, this almost\r\nimperceptible widening can be expressed by a line of almost uniform\r\nweight except for the stretch near the source, where it should grow\r\nthinner and taper off. On maps which are to be reproduced directly\r\nfrom drawings in black and white and which are to show both contour\r\nlines and drainage the lines representing the streams and other water\r\nbodies should generally be drawn freehand and slightly heavier than\r\nthe contour lines, which should be sharper and more precise.\r\n\r\nThe names of all streams or other bodies of water should be in italic\r\nletters, those of the larger streams being lettered in capitals and\r\nthose of the smaller streams in capitals and lower-case letters. (See\r\n\"Lettering,\" p. 53.)\r\n\r\n_Water lining._--The use of water lining on black and white maps\r\nshould be limited to maps on which the water areas are not readily\r\ndistinguishable from the land areas. In rough drawings that are to\r\nserve only as copy for engravers a flat color may be used for water\r\nareas and its conversion into water lines specified. In base maps to\r\nbe reproduced in three colors a light-blue tint may be used in lieu of\r\nwater lining, and it can be printed either flat or in a fine ruling\r\ntransferred to the stone that is to print the drainage. The engraving\r\nof water lines is expensive, and the flat blue color should generally\r\nbe preferred.\r\n\r\nWater lining usually consists of 30 to 45 lines on engraved or large\r\nmaps, but on small maps and sketch maps the number may be reduced as\r\ndesired. Care should be taken that the lines are as nearly parallel as\r\nthey can be made freehand and of even weight or thickness. The first\r\nthree to six lines outside the coast line should be somewhat closer\r\ntogether than those farther out and should conform closely to the\r\ncoast line, but the spacing between the lines should increase and the\r\nlines should become almost imperceptibly less conformable to the coast\r\nline as they reach their outer limit, the last three to six being made\r\nwith the greatest care and refinement. Water-lined maps that are to be\r\nreproduced by photographic processes should be drawn at least twice\r\npublication size. The reduction will bring the lines closer together,\r\nand the reproduction will show a more refined effect than could\r\npossibly be produced by the most skillful drawing.\r\n\r\nGood examples of water lining, such as are shown on the topographic\r\natlas sheets of the Survey, should be studied by draftsmen before\r\nthey undertake such work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U.

The size of the letters used should indicate in a\r\ngeneral way the relative importance of the feature or group to which\r\nthey are applied, but on some maps the county seats, State capitals,\r\nand large cities may be distinguished by different symbols. The names\r\nof civil divisions are lettered in sizes depending on their relative\r\ngrade and the size of the area or space in which the names are to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThe features shown on a topographic map may be broadly separated into\r\nfour groups and are lettered as follows:\r\n\r\nCivil divisions (countries, States, counties, townships, land grants,\r\nreservations, cities, towns, villages, settlements, schools, lodges,\r\nranches, etc.), roman capitals or capitals and lower case.\r\n\r\nPublic works (railroads, tunnels, roads, canals, ferries, bridges,\r\nfords, dams, mains, mines, forts, trails, etc.), slanting gothic\r\ncapitals (light) or capitals and lower case.\r\n\r\nHydrographic features (oceans, seas, gulfs, bays, lakes, ponds,\r\nrivers, creeks, brooks, springs, wells, falls, rapids, marshes,\r\nglaciers, etc.), italic capitals or capitals and lower case.\r\n\r\nHypsographic features (mountains, ranges, peaks, plateaus, cliffs,\r\nbuttes, canyons, valleys, peninsulas, islands, capes, etc.), upright\r\ngothic capitals (light) or capitals and lower case.\r\n\r\nThe essential principles of lettering have been described in numerous\r\ntreatises and are well understood by most draftsmen. The correct form\r\nof each letter may be learned from such treatises, but spacing and\r\narrangement are best learned by observation and experience. Good\r\nlettering will not strongly attract attention, but even slight\r\nimperfections of form, spacing, slant, and shading will be quickly\r\ndetected and criticized. Map letterers should note that the name of a\r\nplace or the number of a symbol should be put to the right of the\r\nsymbol if possible and a little above or below it--not to the left and\r\ndirectly on a line with it, as Tucson=o=, 17=o=, Dallas=o=, Carson=o=.\r\nNames indicating large areas, if written from west to east, should\r\ncurve with the parallels, and all names should be so lettered that \"if\r\nthey should fall they would fall on their feet.\" Every name should be\r\ndistinctly legible but not so conspicuous as to subordinate the\r\nfeature it designates. Lines should therefore not be broken in order\r\nto make the lettering clear except where there is possible danger that\r\nthe smaller spaces may be filled up in printing. The lettering on a\r\nmap should always be so spaced that it will properly fit the area it\r\nis intended to designate. In names consisting of two or more words the\r\nletters should not be closely spaced if wide spaces are left between\r\nthe words. In numbers, except those used to indicate elevations on\r\ncontour Lines or elsewhere, thousands should always be set off by\r\ncommas.\r\n\r\nDraftsmen often draw bad forms for commas, quotation marks,\r\napostrophes, and question marks. The following forms are correct:\r\nComma , ; quotation marks \"\" ; apostrophe ' ; question mark ? .\r\n\r\nLETTERING BY TYPE.\r\n\r\nNames and short notes printed from type on paper, to be cut out and\r\npasted in proper positions on maps or other drawings, now furnish a\r\nlarge proportion of the lettering on the Survey's illustrations. The\r\nstrips are likely to become detached by the repeated handling of a\r\ndrawing, however, unless they are securely pasted on. The best results\r\ncan be obtained by having the type printed on a special brand of\r\n\"noncurling\" gummed paper, from which the lettering is cut in squares\r\nor strips, which are dampened and applied to the proper places on the\r\ndrawing. In handling such strips a pair of dentist's tweezers is\r\nuseful. When mucilage is applied to printed strips of ordinary paper\r\nthe moisture causes the paper to warp or curl, often so much as to\r\naffect the reproduction of the drawing. This printed lettering is\r\ngenerally used, however, only for headings, titles, notes, and other\r\nmatter that stands alone; it should not be used for the geographic\r\nnames in the body of a map unless only a few names are to appear, for\r\nthe strips of paper bearing the names may obscure parts of the map.\r\nThe reproduction of this lettering by photo-engraving or\r\nphotolithography gives results superior to those obtained from hand\r\nlettering unless each letter is made with the utmost care, work which\r\nis considered a waste of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF ILLUSTRATIONS PLATE V\r\n\r\n\r\nREDUCTION SHEET USED IN LETTERING ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe largest size shows the letters unreduced; the other sizes show\r\nthe letters reduced as indicated in the margin.]\r\n\r\nType is used also for printing lettering directly on a drawing exactly\r\nin proper position, by a special type holder, somewhat like a\r\nself-inking stamp.\r\n\r\nMost of the styles and sizes of type now used on maps in the Survey's\r\nreports are shown in Plate V.\r\n\r\nIf a drawing is to be reduced one-half the smallest type used should\r\nbe about 2 millimeters in height; if it is to be reduced one-third the\r\nsmallest type used should be about 1.5 millimeters in height; and so\r\non. No letter whose vertical height after reproduction would be less\r\nthan about 1 millimeter should be used, and the larger lettering\r\nshould bear a proper relation to the smaller. Sheets showing the\r\nstyles of type in use by the Survey, in full size and reduced\r\none-fourth, one-third, two-fifths, one-half, three-fifths, two-thirds,\r\nand three-fourths, will be furnished on request. If a drawing is to be\r\nreduced one-half, for example, the sheet that has been reduced\r\none-half will show the size of the lettering on the printed plate, so\r\nthat the draftsman, by referring to the sheet showing the reduction he\r\ndesires, can select type of a size that will be legible. Plate V shows\r\na part of this reduction sheet.\r\n\r\nABBREVIATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe following are the correct forms for abbreviations used on maps and\r\nother illustrations:\r\n\r\nA.

Neither the word nor the abbreviation for railroad or\r\nrailway should be placed on a map; the chartered name (or initials of\r\nthe name) and the road symbol are sufficient.\r\n\r\nNames of States and Territories should be abbreviated, where\r\nabbreviation is necessary, as follows:\r\n\r\nAla.     Ga.      Minn.    N. J.    Tenn.\r\nAriz.    Ill.     Miss.    N. Mex.  Tex.\r\nArk.     Ind.     Mo.      N. Y.    Va.\r\nCalif.   Kans.    Mont.    Okla.    Vt.\r\nColo.    Ky.      Nebr.

Dak.\r\n\r\nAlaska, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Ohio, Samoa, and Utah should\r\nbe written in full.\r\n\r\nThe abbreviations used on the margins of maps for subdivisions of land\r\nshould be as follows (note punctuation): T. 2 N., E. 3 W. On\r\nlarge-scale plats the marginal lettering should be as follows: N. 1/2\r\nNE. 1/4 sec. 1, T. 7 N., K 2 W.; fractional secs. 2 and 35, Tps. 7 and\r\n8 N., R. 2 W.; NW. 1/4 sec. 20, T, 7 N., R. 2 W. In spelling fractions\r\nuse half and quarter, not one-half and one-quarter.\r\n\r\nThe abbreviated forms of such names as North Fork and South Fork\r\nshould be N. Fork and S. Fork, not North Fk. and South Fk.\r\n\r\nAdditional abbreviations used on illustrations are as follows:\r\n\r\n  N. for north, NE. for northeast, NNE. for north-northeast, etc.\r\n    Capitalize directions affixed to street names, as NW., SE.\r\n    (1800 F St. NW.).\r\n\r\n  Sec. and secs. for section and sections before a number.\r\n    Capitalize only at the beginning of a line or sentence.\r\n\r\n  a. m. and p. m. for antemeridian and postmeridian, as 4.30 p. m.\r\n    Lower-case unless in line of caps.\r\n\r\n  & in names of corporations or companies.

The following are the\r\ncorrect forms:\r\n\r\n  Jan.    Apr.    July    Oct.\r\n  Feb.    May     Aug.    Nov.\r\n  Mar.    June    Sept    Dec.\r\n\r\nThe abbreviations for number and numbers before figures are No. and\r\nNos. The o should never be raised, as in N^o. The abbreviation for Mac\r\nis Mc, not M^c.\r\n\r\nAll periods should be omitted from abbreviations used in the body of a\r\nmap unless their omission would cause misunderstanding. They are\r\ngenerally unnecessary, and if used on some maps they are likely to be\r\nmistaken for symbols representing certain features, such as houses or\r\nflowing wells, if either is shown. Periods used on drawings that are\r\nto be reproduced \"direct\" or photomechanically should always be\r\nslightly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nNAMES OF RAILROADS.\r\n\r\nThe names of railroads may be written in full or abbreviated, in\r\naccordance with the kind of map and the space available. On a sketch\r\nmap in black and white the initial letters are generally sufficient.\r\nOn a more detailed map, if there is room enough, the names may be\r\nspelled out. As already stated, neither the words \"railroad\" and\r\n\"railway\" nor the abbreviations R. R. and Ry. should be used on a map.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKE-UP OF MAPS.\r\n\r\nFORMS FOR CERTAIN FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe proper forms for certain features of maps, such as the borders,\r\ntitles, explanations, bar scales, captions, arrows indicating true\r\nnorth and magnetic declination, source, and authorship, are shown in\r\nPlate VII. Note particularly the style and position of the marginal\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nBORDER.\r\n\r\nA finished map border is used or omitted according to the kind of map\r\nprepared. Diagrammatic maps and maps on which no parallels and\r\nmeridians appear do not need finished borders. On a map that shows\r\ncomplete areal geologic or other coloring, such as a map in a Survey\r\ngeologic folio, the border lines tend to destroy the simple effect of\r\nthe whole map. On a map that is not completely colored and on all very\r\nlarge maps borders are really necessary. If borders are used, however,\r\nthe space between the neat line and the outer line of the border\r\nshould be only sufficient to provide proper space for the numbers\r\nshowing latitude and longitude or township and range. A simple rule[8]\r\nfor determining the width of this space is as follows: Divide the sum\r\nof the dimensions of the map by 2 and find the square root of the\r\nquotient, which will represent the width of the border in sixteenths\r\nof an inch. Example: Map is 20 by 30 inches; (20 + 30)/2 = 25; square\r\nroot of 25 = 5; width of border = 5/16 inch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Worked out by Martin Solem, of the U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey.]\r\n\r\nThe numbers showing latitude and longitude should be in shaded arabic\r\nnumerals and those showing township and range in gothic. The symbols\r\nfor degree, minute, and second should not be crowded. On a map that\r\nhas no added border lines the numbers should be in hair-line gothic.\r\n\r\nTITLE.\r\n\r\nThe title of a map should be in roman letters and if placed at the\r\nlower margin should generally be arranged in two lines, unless it is\r\nshort. If it forms two or more lines the lines should be well\r\nbalanced. The first line should describe the position of the area; the\r\nsecond line should state the purpose of the map, as\r\n\r\n    MAP OF BUTTE AND VICINITY, MONTANA\r\n\r\n    SHOWING LOCATION OF MINES AND PROSPECTS.\r\n\r\nA title placed inside the border of a map should be arranged in a\r\nseries of lines, generally beginning with \"Map of\" or \"Geologic map\r\nof.\" and the line showing the dominant part of the title should be\r\nemphasized by larger lettering, thus:\r\n\r\n                                 =MAP OF=\r\n                             THE VICINITY OF BUTTE\r\n                                    MONTANA\r\n                    SHOWING LOCATION OF MINES AND PROSPECTS.\r\n\r\nThe name of the author or compiler of a map or of the person supplying\r\nthe geologic or other data shown on it may be placed either beneath\r\nthe title or in the lower right corner, just below the border line,\r\nand the names of the topographers or the source of the base should be\r\nstated in the lower left corner, just below the border line. If the\r\ntitle is placed inside the border all notes giving credit for any part\r\nor features of the map may be placed beneath the title or scale. (See\r\nPI. VII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF ILLUSTRATIONS PLATE VII\r\n\r\n\r\nDETAILS OF THE MAKE-UP OF A GEOLOGIC MAP]\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.\r\n\r\nThe symbols, patterns, or colors used on a map should be given in a\r\nseries of rectangles or \"boxes,\" accompanied by explanatory terms in\r\nthe form shown in Plate VII, headed \"Explanation.\" If the explanation\r\nis small a convenient place for it on some maps may be found within\r\nthe neat lines. If no space is available there, or if it is so large\r\nthat there is not room to place it there without obscuring other\r\ndetails, it may be placed either vertically along the right margin, as\r\nshown in Plate VII, or horizontally under the title. A geologic\r\nexplanation should preferably be arranged vertically, as in Plate VII,\r\nso as to show the relative age of the formations by the positions of\r\nthe boxes. This explanation should be carefully worked out in pencil\r\nby the draftsman and approved by the committee on geologic names\r\nbefore it is drawn in ink, in order to save time in making\r\ncorrections.\r\n\r\nIn lettering the explanation roman letters or type should be used for\r\nthe titles under the boxes and italic of smaller size for the\r\nsubtitles or descriptive detail, which should be inclosed in\r\nparentheses. The names of geologic periods and systems should be in\r\ngothic capitals, the names of series or groups should be in italic\r\nlower case, and the limit of each period, system, or group should be\r\nindicated by braces. The general style and arrangement shown in the\r\nSurvey's geologic folios should be followed, and this and the\r\narrangement of other matter is shown in Plate VII. Care should be\r\ntaken not to crowd the explanation, and if corrections are necessary\r\nthey should be so made that each line of the matter in which they\r\nappear will be properly spaced.\r\n\r\nThe explanation for a map that is to be engraved or to be reproduced\r\nby lithography need only be sketched in to show general style and\r\narrangement. The engraver or the lithographer will supply such matter\r\nin proper form according to specifications. For direct reproduction,\r\nhowever, as by photolithography or zinc etching, the lettering must\r\neither be carefully drawn with pen or printed from type on slips,\r\nwhich are pasted on the drawing.\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC SCALES FOR MAPS.\r\n\r\nA bar scale for miles or feet should be given on every map, and if the\r\nmap is of international interest the metric scale should be given just\r\nbeneath the scale of miles or feet. The accepted designs for these\r\nscales are shown in figure 7. The scale should be accompanied by any\r\nnecessary statement pertaining to the base map, such as \"Contour\r\ninterval 20 feet,\" \"Datum is mean sea level.\" The fractional scale\r\n(1/250,000, for example) should be given on all except the more simple\r\nkinds of maps, and the date of publication should also appear just\r\nbelow the scale or scales. The single-line bar scale should be used\r\nonly on small or simple maps. The length of the bar scale must depend\r\non the size of the map and the space available. Those shown in figure\r\n7 were made over blue prints from scales used by the Survey.\r\n\r\nTo make a bar scale for a map of unknown scale that shows only a\r\nsingle meridian and parallel, or for a map on which no meridians or\r\nparallels are shown, first ascertain the distance between two points\r\nshown on the map by reference to other authentic maps. If, for\r\nexample, the distance between two such points is 16.315 miles draw a\r\nhorizontal line (_a_ in fig. 8) representing this distance on the map,\r\nand at its end, at right angles to it, draw another line (_b_)\r\nactually measuring 16.315 units of any convenient denomination. Draw a\r\nstraight line (c) diagonally between the ends of lines _a_ and _b_.\r\nThen set off on line _b_ any convenient number of the units selected,\r\nsay 5 or 10, and project from the points set off lines exactly\r\nparallel with line _c_ to line _a_. The distance and the number of the\r\nunits thus marked on line a will indicate the number of miles covered\r\nby that distance on the map, as shown in figure 8.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--Designs for bar scales.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--Method of making a bar scale for a map of\r\nunknown scale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF ILLUSTRATIONS PLATE VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPATTERNS USED TO SHOW DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN AREAS ON BLACK AND WHITE\r\nMAPS\r\n\r\nContrasts may be increased by varying the direction and spacing of\r\nLines]\r\n\r\nSYMBOLS.\r\n\r\nSymbols should be drawn with as much care as letters, though to a\r\ncritic they may not appear so bad as poor lettering unless he finds\r\nthem glaringly large or so small that he can discover or identify them\r\nonly with difficulty. The size of a symbol must depend on its\r\nimportance on the map bearing it. On a map that shows numerous mines,\r\nfor instance, the crossed hammers or the symbols for shafts should be\r\nnot only visible but conspicuous. The draftsman who is to make such a\r\nmap must know beforehand how much his drawing will be reduced in\r\nreproduction and must make the symbols in proportion to the reduction.\r\nThe symbols shown in Plate II (p. 20) should be used in all the\r\nSurvey's illustrations where they are appropriate.\r\n\r\nAREAL PATTERNS FOR BLACK AND WHITE MAPS.\r\n\r\nThe conventional patterns used on a map to distinguish separate areas,\r\nchiefly geologic, are shown in Plate VIII. The patterns shown\r\nrepresent the proper combinations of lines, dots, and other forms and\r\nshould be spaced openly or closely according to the size of the area\r\ncovered, the contrast needed between areas, and the general clearness\r\nand effect desired. If a map is to show both small and large areas\r\ndense or closely spaced patterns should generally be used for the\r\nsmaller areas, even if they may be required for some fairly large\r\nareas representing the same formation or condition. On the other hand,\r\nopen patterns should be used for large areas. Again, it may be\r\nnecessary to make certain areas more conspicuous than others, and this\r\neffect can be best produced by drawing the lines closer together\r\nrather than by making them heavier, unless the area covered is small\r\nor unless a closely spaced similar pattern has been or will be used\r\nelsewhere on the map. Heavy-line patterns or bars are not desirable.\r\nThe lines forming a pattern should generally be drawn at an angle of\r\n45° to the sides of the map; they should be drawn vertically or\r\nhorizontally only in small areas or in areas not crossed by meridians\r\nor parallels or by other lines running in the same direction. The\r\nlines should preferably run across the long axis of an area, not\r\nparallel to it, and the predominating trend or general direction of\r\nthe areas of one geologic formation on a map should decide the\r\ndirection of the lines for all areas of that formation on the same\r\nmap, even if the rule must be violated on some of the minor areas.\r\n\r\nAn effort should always be made to produce a pattern that is\r\nsubordinate in strength to the main lines of the base map on which it\r\nis drawn. In black and white maps, as in colored maps, unlike patterns\r\nshould be placed next to each other. If they are so placed it may not\r\nbe necessary to rule the lines on two adjacent areas in opposite\r\ndirections to produce needed distinctions. A section liner or other\r\nruling device should be used in drawing line patterns in order to\r\nproduce uniformly even spacing. The application of six of these\r\nconventional patterns to a base map is shown in figure 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--Map bearing six areal line patterns.]\r\n\r\nSTANDARD COLORS FOR GEOLOGIC MAPS.\r\n\r\nThe standard series of colors for systems of sedimentary rocks is\r\nshown on the maps in the Survey's geologic folios but is subject to\r\nmodifications for use on maps in other Survey reports. Each system is\r\nrepresented by a different color, and if there are two or more\r\nformations in one system they are generally distinguished by using\r\ndifferent patterns composed of straight parallel lines in the same\r\ncolor. The patterns for subaerial deposits (chiefly Quaternary) are\r\ncomposed of dots or circles, or combinations of both, and may be\r\nprinted in any color, but the color most often used is yellow or\r\nochraceous orange. No specific colors are prescribed for igneous\r\nrocks, but if only a few areas are shown red or pink is preferred. The\r\ncolors used for igneous rocks are generally more brilliant and purer\r\nthan those used for sedimentary rocks. For small areas they are used\r\n\"solid\"; for large areas they are reduced in tone by the use of a\r\nsuitable cross-line pattern or \"reticle.\" Metamorphic rocks are\r\nrepresented by short dashes irregularly placed. These dashes may be in\r\nblack or in color over a ground tint or over an uncolored area, or\r\nthey may be in white on a ground tint or pattern. The standard colors\r\nused for the sedimentary series covering the 12 systems recognized by\r\nthe Geological Survey are: Quaternary (Q), ochraceous orange; Tertiary\r\n(T), _yellow ocher_ and _isabella color_; Cretaceous (K),\r\n_olive-green_ or _rainette-green_; Jurassic (J), _blue-green_ or\r\n_niagara-green_; Triassic (TR), _light peacock-blue_ or _bluish\r\ngray-green_; Carboniferous (C), _blue_ or _columibia-blue_; Devonian\r\n(D), _gray-purple_ or _heliotrope-gray_; Silurian (S), _purple_ or\r\n_argyle-purple_; Ordovician (0), _red-purple_ or _rocellin-purple_;\r\nCambrian (-C), _brick-red_ or _etruscan red_; Algonkian (A), _terra\r\ncotta_ or _onion-skin pink_; Archean (AR), _gray-brown_ or _drab_.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Names printed in italic are from \"Color standards and\r\nnomenclature,\" by Robert Ridgway.]\r\n\r\nREDUCTION OF ENLARGEMENT OF MAPS.\r\n\r\nThe following is the simplest and most accurate method of marking the\r\nreduction or enlargement of a map to a selected scale: Measure the\r\ndistance between the extreme meridians along one of the parallels.\r\n(See fig. 10.) Convert this distance into miles by multiplying the\r\nnumber of degrees it covers (say 3) by the number of miles in a\r\ndegree. A degree on the forty-third parallel, for example, is 50.669\r\nmiles,[10] which multiplied by 3 equals 152.007 miles. Then draw a\r\nline on the margin of the map, outside the border, the exact length of\r\nthe 3 degrees, and just below this line draw another line representing\r\nthe same number of miles (152.007) on the scale to which the map is to\r\nbe reduced or enlarged. Then mark to reduce or enlarge the upper line\r\nto the lower line, as shown in figure 10. A long line will reduce\r\nerror and give greater accuracy than a short one, and therefore as\r\ngreat a distance should be set off as possible. The number of miles\r\nrepresented by both lines and the fractional scale to which it is to\r\nbe reduced should be stated on the drawing, for permanent record.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See U. S. Geol. Survey Bull. 650, p. 37. 1916.]\r\n\r\nMaps that will bear reduction without affecting the clearness of the\r\ndetails they show may be reduced to fit the book in which they are to\r\nappear, regardless of definite scale. The reduction for such maps is\r\nbest marked in fractions, as \"1/2 off,\" \"1/3 off,\" \"2/3 off.\" If the\r\nsize needed is not exactly represented by these fractions it should be\r\nindicated in inches, as \"Reduce this line to 7-1/2 inches,\" or \"Reduce\r\nto 4-3/8 inches in width.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--Diagram showing method of marking maps for\r\nreduction or enlargement (for record).]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGRAMS.\r\n\r\nIn preparing a diagram a draftsman should endeavor to make its parts\r\nand relations perfectly clear to the reader. He should study the\r\ndrawing or material furnished by the author until he fully understands\r\nit and should endeavor to reproduce it simply and legibly. Any\r\nlettering that may be needed should generally be in plain upright or\r\nslanting gothic type (see Pl. IX), or it may be in roman.\r\n\r\nA diagram should generally be drawn on bristol board or on blue-lined\r\nsection paper and should be marked for reduction to the minimum size.\r\nIt should bear no title, as the title will be set up in type by the\r\nprinter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe sections used in geologic reports are of two widely different\r\nkinds. One shows only the broader relations of parts; the other shows\r\ndetails of structure as well as relations. One is diagrammatic; the\r\nother is more realistic and graphic. The draftsman should prepare all\r\nsections strictly according to the copy supplied by the author but\r\nshould use proper symbols and make a more finished drawing. The\r\nvarious kinds of sections, most of them geologic, are described on\r\npages 29-30, and the conventions used to express lithologic character\r\nare shown in Plate III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF ILLUSTRATIONS PLATE VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGRAMS AND CURVES.]\r\n\r\nDetailed drawings of this kind, though entirely conventional, can be\r\nso prepared as to give a satisfactory expression of nature. The\r\ndraftsman should study well-prepared sections in Geological Survey\r\nreports and should learn the details of folding and faulting from\r\ntextbooks. He should first ascertain whether or not the vertical scale\r\nin the original section has been unduly exaggerated, and if so he\r\nshould confer with the author with a view to reducing the exaggeration\r\nas much as possible. He should submit to the author all questions as\r\nto doubtful points, as well as all suggestions for improvement in\r\nexpression, before he makes any changes, and he should make\r\ncorrections only on the author's approval. A seeming inaccuracy in an\r\nauthor's drawing may be a faithful representation of natural\r\nconditions. For example, a formation that seems to be omitted by\r\ninadvertence in drawing may really \"pinch out\" at a point represented\r\nin the section. (See a on fig. 11.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--Structure section showing method of\r\ndetermining the secession of folds.]\r\n\r\nPenciled lines corresponding to those shown by dots in figure 11\r\nshould be carefully added in redrawing a roughly sketched section that\r\nshows complex folding. An original indefinite sketch that shows\r\ncomplicated structure affords opportunities for error in preparing the\r\nnew drawing, and omissions may be detected by following the formations\r\nas they would be continued above and below the section, as shown by\r\nthe dotted lines in the figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANS AND CROSS SECTIONS OF MINES.\r\n\r\nPlans of mines, like diagrams, should not be elaborate, and their\r\nlettering should be plain and legible, yet it should not be so\r\nconspicuous as to obscure other details. Gothic letters should\r\ngenerally be used, but some plans require different styles of\r\nlettering, especially for geographic or other names that should be\r\ncoordinate with those on maps or other illustrations in the book.\r\nUnless there are good reasons, however, for varying the styles of\r\nlettering, plain gothic capitals, or capitals and lower-case letters,\r\neither upright or slanting, should be used. Abbreviations for the\r\nnumbers of levels should generally be given thus: 3d level, 6th level,\r\n200-foot level, etc., or the shorter terms may be spelled out, as\r\nthird level, sixth level. The same general scheme of lettering should\r\nbe used on all plans and cross sections that are to appear in one\r\npublication or in one series of similar papers.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of such drawings to the minimum scale consistent with\r\nclearness is always advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWINGS OF SPECIMENS OF ROCKS AND FOSSILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS USED.\r\n\r\nDrawings of specimens or other objects were once made with brush and\r\npencil or with pen and ink, by means of measurements taken with\r\ndividers or by viewing the specimen through a camera lucida. Each of\r\nthese methods is still used, but by using the camera lucida in\r\nsketching: the outlines and details more accurate proportions and\r\nrelations can be produced, whether the object is to be enlarged or\r\nreduced, than by any other means except photography.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSH AND PENCIL DRAWINGS.\r\n\r\nIn all drawings or photographs of specimens, except photomicrographs\r\nof thin sections, the light should appear to come from the upper left\r\nquarter. A disregard of the well-established rule that the direction\r\nof illumination should be uniform throughout a series of drawings\r\nwould cause confusion or uncertainty in the interpretation of the\r\nrelief shown in them.\r\n\r\nReynolds's three-ply and four-ply bristol board affords a satisfactory\r\nsurface for brush and pencil drawings. Its surface is smooth and hard\r\nand, being free from coating of any kind, permits satisfactory\r\nerasures without great injury; its color is pure whits; and it is\r\ndurable.\r\n\r\nBoss's relief hand-stipple paper is also well adapted to many kinds of\r\nbrush drawings as well as to its primary use for producing stippled\r\neffects. Very delicate gradations of color or light and shade can be\r\nproduced on its surface with brush and lampblack or with india ink,\r\nand high lights can be made by scraping off the chalky surface.\r\n\r\nThe draftsman who is preparing brush and pencil drawings should have\r\nfirst of all a knowledge of the principles of light and shade, of\r\nreflected light, and (for drawing specimens) of shadow perspective. He\r\nshould also have delicacy of touch and ability to see and interpret\r\nform and to reproduce the soft blending of light and shade shown in a\r\ngood photograph. He should be provided with pencils equal in quality\r\nto the Koh-i-noor B, F, 4H, and 6H; the best quality of red sable\r\nbrushes of the sizes of Winsor & Newton's Nos. 3, 4, and 6; the best\r\nquality of stick india ink; a cake or pan of lampblack; and a\r\nporcelain saucer or slab.\r\n\r\nIn drawings of fossils and of some other specimens a combination of\r\npencil and brush work produces satisfactory results and tends to\r\nincrease speed. The gloss produced by penciling, however, is\r\nobjectionable and should be obviated by a preponderance of brush work.\r\nStick India ink is the best pigment to use in delicate wash drawings,\r\nand lampblack is preferable for large work on which the softer tones\r\nof the shading are not so important and for drawings that are to be\r\nconsiderably reduced when engraved. Gouache (an opaque mixture of\r\nChinese white and lampblack) may also be used, but it is best suited\r\nfor large work.\r\n\r\nIn making corrections on brush drawings the parts to be corrected\r\nshould be carefully washed out with a small short-cropped brush and\r\nwater and still further cleaned by using a rubber eraser over an\r\nerasing shield or an opening cut in a piece of celluloid. Erasures\r\nshould not be made on delicate work with a knife or a sand rubber, as\r\neither will injure the surface and affect reproduction. In measuring a\r\nspecimen with dividers the draftsman should be careful not to injure\r\nthe specimen or to puncture the paper on which he is preparing the\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEN DRAWINGS.\r\n\r\nA draftsman who is preparing drawings of specimens with pen and ink\r\nshould have a good assortment of pens equal to Gillott's Nos. 291,\r\n290, and 170, liquid waterproof ink equal to that manufactured by\r\nHiggins, good pencils, hard and soft rubber erasures, plain dividers,\r\nand Reynolds's bristol board. A glass eraser is also useful.\r\n\r\nGood pen drawings of specimens are much more difficult to make than\r\nbrush drawings. They can be prepared only by a draftsman who has had\r\nsome artistic training and experience in pen work. Few draftsmen can\r\nprepare pen drawings that faithfully represent both the detail and the\r\ntexture of specimens; the shading on many such drawings confuses and\r\ndestroys both detail and texture.\r\n\r\nThe pencil sketch over which a pen drawing of a specimen should be\r\nmade must be prepared in much the same manner as the sketch for a\r\nbrush drawing, though the outlines need not be so delicate. This\r\nsketch is generally made on bristol board. The pen work should begin\r\nwith the outlines and should then be carried to the details, and\r\nfinally to the shading, whether in lines or stipple. The texture of a\r\nspecimen is the best key to the proper shading. If the specimen is\r\ndecidedly granular, stippling is appropriate; if it is smooth or\r\npolished, finely drawn parallel lines, varied in spacing and\r\ncharacter according to depth of shade and texture, are preferable.\r\nErasures can be made with a hard-rubber eraser, other parts being\r\nprotected by a shield, or with a very sharp knife or a glass eraser,\r\nand the parts erased can be resurfaced with an agate burnisher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETOUCHING PHOTOGRAPHS OF SPECIMENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotographs of specimens, particularly fossils that have been coated\r\nto destroy local color, should be printed on velox paper, in a tone\r\nsomewhat lighter than that of ordinary photographs. The details and\r\nrelief should, however, be strong enough to enable the draftsman to\r\nsee them clearly, so that by retouching them and strengthening the\r\nshadows and high lights he can make them sufficiently strong for\r\nreproduction. This he can do by a combination of pencil and brush\r\nwork, the pencil being used sparingly because the gloss produced by\r\nthe graphite is likely to affect reproduction. A No. 3 Winsor &\r\nNewton's red sable brush and lampblack are preferable for the greater\r\npart of this work, and a 4H and a 6H pencil for the fine details and\r\nas a possible aid in producing the finer gradations of shading. The\r\ndetails should be retouched or strengthened under a reading glass to\r\ninsure accuracy; the broader effects can be best produced without the\r\naid of a magnifier.\r\n\r\nErasures on photographs of specimens should be made very carefully\r\nwith a hard rubber that is free from sand, and the parts not to be\r\ndisturbed should be protected with a shield. High lights may be added\r\nby carefully scraping or rubbing the surface of the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDSCAPE DRAWINGS FROM POOR PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA poor photograph or one that has become injured and can not be\r\nretouched for direct reproduction can be utilized by making from it,\r\nas described below, a pen drawing or a brush or crayon drawing, which\r\nwill be almost photographically correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEN DRAWINGS MADE OVER PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nA pen and ink drawing may be made over a blue print or a bromide print\r\n(preferably a blue print) and the photographic image then bleached\r\nout. The blue print should be larger than publication size and should\r\nnot be so dark that the draftsman can not see his lines. If the\r\nnegative is available a bromide enlargement can be obtained; otherwise\r\nthe picture should be rephotographed in larger size, preferably twice\r\npublication size. The enlargement will give the draftsman greater\r\nfreedom in drawing details and will make his work appear finer and\r\nbetter in the reduced illustration. If the photographic print is of a\r\nsubject requiring the use of instruments it should be securely\r\nfastened to a drawing board, square with the board, so that any\r\nhorizontal and vertical lines in it may be ruled by the use of a =T=\r\nsquare and triangle. For specimen or landscape work it need not be\r\nfastened.\r\n\r\nFor bleaching blue prints a saturated solution of oxalate of potassium\r\n(K2C2O4 + H2O) has been used with good results. For bleaching bromide\r\nprints cyanide of potassium (KCN) to which a few drops or flakes of\r\niodine have been added should be used. Neither kind of print should be\r\nbleached until the drawing has been completely finished in every\r\ndetail, because bleaching loosens the fibers of the paper, so that the\r\nink of any added lines is likely to spread. The print should be placed\r\nin a hard-rubber pan, the bleaching solution poured on it, and the pan\r\nrocked until the image disappears. The print should then be carefully\r\nremoved, thoroughly washed in running water, placed between clean\r\nwhite blotters to dry, and finally mounted on cardboard. For\r\ntemporary, hurried work on drawings that are not to be retained for\r\nfuture use the blue print may be mounted first and bleached by pouring\r\nthe bleaching fluid over the mounted print.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSH DRAWINGS FROM POOR PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nBrush drawings may be made directly from photographs by working over\r\nan enlarged print with gouache, or by making a pencil tracing and\r\nsketch of the photograph and working it up with lampblack or india\r\nink. The photograph should be larger than publication size to permit\r\ngreater freedom and breadth in drawing details. The larger size will\r\nalso afford a more refined and better engraving when reduced. If\r\nlampblack or india ink is used and the subject is small, bristol board\r\nis recommended, but if the photograph is larger than, say, 8 by 10\r\ninches, Whatman's hot-pressed double elephant or similar paper, laid\r\ndown with thumb tacks, will prove satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIf gouache is used over a print a preliminary drawing is of course\r\nunnecessary, but the photograph should be an unglazed print of a size\r\nthat will require considerable reduction, and the finished drawing\r\nshould be protected by an oversheet. If lampblack or india ink and not\r\ngouache is used the photograph should be traced and a fairly complete\r\npencil sketch should be made before the brush is used.\r\n\r\nPlates I, IV, _A_, V, _B_, and VII, _B_, Monograph 34, were made from\r\ngouache drawings. Plates III, _A_, VII, _A_, X, XI, XII, XIII, XX,\r\nXXVIII, and XXX, in the same publication, were made from lampblack or\r\nindia-ink wash drawings. The originals can be examined at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTDOOR SKETCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of sketching from nature is one in which few but professional\r\nartists excel. Not many geologists are able to make sketches from\r\nnature that are suitable for direct reproduction. An artistic\r\ndraftsman should be able to redraw the geologist's sketches, however,\r\nin their true perspective and relations, with the skill necessary to\r\nmake them satisfactory illustrations.\r\n\r\nIn most crude outdoor sketches the important features are usually\r\nshown with sufficient clearness to follow. If they are not the\r\ndraftsman should ascertain what those features are and prepare the new\r\ndrawing in such a way as to display them properly. The new drawing\r\nshould be made with pen and ink, generally for reduction to a text\r\nfigure, which is the most appropriate form for such an illustration.\r\n\r\nIn all sketches of this kind the lines should be drawn in such a way\r\nas to produce natural effects and at the same time to make good\r\nprinting plates. Good examples of pen and ink sketches of this class\r\ncan be found in Monograph 34, already referred to, and in the Seventh\r\nAnnual Report, especially Plates XXVIII and XXXVIII; Ninth Annual\r\nReport, Plates XLIII and XLIV; Tenth Annual Report, Plates XIV and XIX\r\nand figure 58; Eleventh Annual Report, Plates XV, XXVII, XXXV, LII,\r\nand LIV and figures 18, 30, 31, 67, 98, and 99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWINGS OF CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA crystal should generally be drawn in outline with straight lines.\r\nThe invisible rear side of a crystal, if shown, should be represented\r\nby dashed lines. The outer boundary line of a crystal should be\r\nslightly heavier than the inside lines, which should all be of the\r\nsame weight. Striations should be shown by straight lines; broken or\r\nuneven surfaces by irregular lines. A twinning line, if an\r\nintersection edge, should be solid; if not an intersection edge it\r\nshould be broken into dashes. Italic, Greek, German, and Old English\r\nletters are used to mark crystal faces. All faces of a given form\r\nshould be marked by the same letter but may be differentiated, if\r\nnecessary, by primes or numerals, thus: m, m', m'', m''', m{'v}.\r\n\"Leaders\" should be short full lines, or, if these are likely to be\r\nconfusing, they should be dashes. Numbers may be used in place of\r\nletters for specific purposes. Letters indicating twin faces are\r\nunderscored; a second twin is doubly underscored or overscored, thus:\r\nm_, m=, m¯. Twin units may be differentiated by the use of roman\r\nnumerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETOUCHING PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn author, of course, selects his photographs to illustrate some\r\nspecial features; he does not always consider their fitness for\r\nreproduction. Photographs that are blurred or out of focus, those in\r\nwhich the shadows are too black or lack transparency, and those which\r\nhave local defects, such as bad skies or spots, must be worked over to\r\nmake them suitable for reproduction. In order to remedy these defects\r\nand produce natural results the draftsman doing work of this sort\r\nshould be able to see and interpret nature properly and to supply\r\nnatural effects in a manner corresponding with those produced\r\nphotographically. He should be sufficiently expert with the brush and\r\npencil and in handling an air brush to duplicate the delicate and soft\r\ntones in the photograph, and he should know how the pigments he uses\r\nwill \"take\" when the subject is reproduced.\r\n\r\nThe retoucher should have access to an air brush and should provide\r\nhimself with a jar of photo white or blanc d'argent and a color box\r\ncontaining indian red, crimson lake, yellow ocher, lampblack, and\r\nultramarine--colors with which he can duplicate those shown in any\r\nphotograph. He should also have the best grade of red sable brushes,\r\nranging in size from No. 3 to No. 8, a stack of porcelain saucers, and\r\na jar of oxgall. By mixing the colors to match exactly the shades of a\r\nphotograph and using a red sable brush he can strengthen details,\r\n\"spot out\" flaws, and remove imperfections, except those in skies or\r\nother large, flat areas, for which he must use an air brush.\r\n\r\nThe air brush has become a necessary adjunct to a retoucher's outfit.\r\nSmooth, even gradations of flat tones can not be successfully applied\r\nto photographs without it, and it is therefore indispensable,\r\nespecially for retouching skies and covering other large areas.\r\n\r\nBefore retouching a photograph the draftsman should mix in a saucer a\r\ntint that will match the color of the part that is to be retouched and\r\nshould try this tint and note its effect after it has dried and change\r\nit, if necessary, until it matches the color exactly. If he is to\r\nretouch a number of photographs that have the same local color he may\r\nwith advantage make up enough of the tint for the entire lot,\r\nthoroughly mixing it and seeing that it is not too thin. In making\r\nthis tint he should use only pigments of the best grade, and if he\r\nfinds that the Chinese or other white he is using does not photograph\r\nwell, or that it does not hold its color, he should discard it at once\r\nand use another brand. Photographs that are to be retouched should be\r\nlarge enough to permit sufficient reduction to soften the effects of\r\nretouching.\r\n\r\nIn order to eliminate the lines of junction between two or more\r\nphotographs that are joined together to form a panorama some\r\nadjustment or fitting of details by retouching is generally required\r\nbefore the group is rephotographed to obtain a new print of the whole\r\non one piece of paper. As it is often desirable to increase the width\r\nof such an illustration the photographer should be instructed to print\r\nthe photograph on a strip of paper that is wider than the negative, so\r\nthat, if necessary, the retouching may be carried above or below the\r\nnew print to add depth to the illustration.\r\n\r\nPanoramas may also be drawn from photographs with either pen or brush\r\nin the manner described on pages 68-69.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. PROCESSES OF REPRODUCING ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS EMPLOYED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preliminary work in producing illustrations includes the\r\npreparation, from originals submitted by authors, of drawings and\r\nother kinds of \"copy\" in such a way that the copy can be reproduced in\r\nmultiple by printing.\r\n\r\nSeveral processes are used for preparing plates for printing\r\nillustrations, and each has its peculiar features of excellence. One\r\nprocess may render fine details with facility but may fail in\r\nuniformity in large editions; another may be cheap and effective on\r\nthe whole but may not reproduce fine details; and still another may\r\ngive fine color or tone effects but may be too expensive. Therefore a\r\nknowledge of the varied uses and results and of the cost of the\r\nseveral processes of reproduction and, on the other hand, of the kinds\r\nof originals that are best suited for reproduction by any one of the\r\nprocesses is essential to effectiveness and economy in planning,\r\npreparing, and reproducing an illustration.\r\n\r\nThe following condensed descriptions of processes are intended mainly\r\nto aid in determining the kind of copy that is appropriate for each\r\nprocess and the kind and quality of reproduction to be expected, so\r\nthat only the principal operations or stages in each process are\r\ndescribed. Wood engraving, which was used in making printing plates\r\nfor many of the illustrations in the early publications of the\r\nGeological Survey, is described here only to compare that laborious\r\nand \"indirect\" method of engraving cuts with the more modern kinds of\r\nrelief engraving. In 1892 it gave way to photo-engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTO-ENGRAVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe term \"photo-engraving\" is applied to processes by which a black\r\nand white line drawing, photograph, or like original is reproduced in\r\nrelief on a metal plate from which prints may be made on an ordinary\r\nprinting press, in distinction from processes that print from flat or\r\nrelatively flat surfaces, such as the lithographic and photogelatin\r\nprocesses. The photo-engraving processes that are most generally used\r\nare those called \"zinc etching\" and \"half-tone engraving.\" These\r\nprocesses depend on the discovery that gelatin or similar organic\r\nmaterial, if treated with potassium or ammonium bichromate and exposed\r\nto the action of light, is made insoluble in water. If a metal plate\r\ncoated with bichromatized gelatin or albumen is exposed to light under\r\na negative the parts acted upon by light become insoluble and those\r\nnot acted upon remain unchanged and may be washed away so as to expose\r\nthe metal, which is then etched with acid in order to give relief to\r\nthe unexposed parts and make of them a printing surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nZINC ETCHING.\r\n\r\nZinc etching is adapted to the direct reproduction of a pen and ink\r\ndrawing composed of lines, dots, or solid black areas. On the finished\r\nmetal plate these lines, dots, and solid areas form the printing\r\nsurface, and the spaces between them, which have been etched away,\r\nrepresent the white or blank parts of the picture. The process is\r\ncheap and is almost universally used for reproducing small drawings\r\ndesigned for text illustrations. It is also well adapted to the\r\nreproduction of maps and diagrams measuring in print not more than\r\nabout 10 by 14 inches. One of the chief advantages of this and of all\r\nother direct (photographic) processes of engraving is that they\r\nreproduce a drawing in facsimile, whereas the \"personal equation\" must\r\nenter into all engravings made by an indirect method--that is, by\r\nhand--such as wood engraving, wax engraving, and engraving on stone or\r\ncopper, which make it necessary to compare every detail of the proof\r\nwith every detail of the drawing before the engraving can be approved.\r\nThe pen drawing to be reproduced, which should preferably be\r\nconsiderably larger than the completed engraving, is first\r\nphotographed to the proper size or scale on an ordinary negative film.\r\nThe film is then stripped from the negative and reversed in order that\r\nthe etched plate may print the design as in the original and that the\r\nfilm may be grouped with other films on one large glass and all\r\nprinted at the same time. The negative (whether a single film or\r\nseveral) is then placed in a specially constructed printing frame in\r\ncontact under pressure with a sensitized zinc plate and exposed to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAfter the zinc plate has been removed from the printing frame (in the\r\ndark room) the plate is rolled with printer's transfer ink, which\r\nresists acid, and placed in a shallow tray containing water, in which\r\nit is rocked for several minutes, and then taken out and rubbed gently\r\nwith cotton. The parts of the coating of the plate that were acted on\r\nby light have become insoluble and will therefore be unaffected by the\r\nwater, but the parts of the coating not acted on by light and\r\ntherefore not hardened will be removed by the washing, which will\r\nexpose the metal and leave the parts acted on by light--the\r\npicture--in black lines, dots, etc. The plate is then dusted with\r\n\"topping powder,\" a resinous substance which adheres only to the parts\r\ncarrying the ink. The plate is then heated so that the resin and the\r\nink that remain fuse together and form, when cooled, a resistant\r\nsurface which will not be affected by the acid to be used later in\r\netching the unprotected parts of the plate.\r\n\r\nThe plate is now ready for a preliminary etching in a fluid consisting\r\nof water and a few drops of nitric acid. It is placed in a tray,\r\nrocked gently for a short time, and then removed, washed well in\r\nrunning water, drained, and dried with gentle heat. \"Dragon's blood,\"\r\na resinous powder that resists the action of acid, is next applied to\r\nthe plate, in order to protect the sides of the lines and the dots\r\nfrom the acid, and the plate is then heated just sufficiently to melt\r\nthe powder and units it with the ink. A small quantity of nitric acid\r\nis now added to the etching bath, and the plate is subjected to its\r\nfirst thorough biting or etching. It is then removed from the bath,\r\nwashed under a tap, carefully wiped with a damp rag, and dried with\r\ngentle heat.\r\n\r\nThe plate is thus treated three or more times until it is etched deep\r\nenough to insure satisfactory printing, and it is then ready for\r\nfinishing, which consists of deepening the larger open spaces between\r\nthe lines with a routing machine and of cutting away with hand gravers\r\nlines that are improperly connected or that are so close together that\r\nthey will not print separately. The routing machine is provided with a\r\ncutting tool mounted on a revolving spindle that projects downward\r\ninto the engraved plate, which is securely fastened. The movement of\r\nthe arm that holds the cutter is universal and can be controlled with\r\ngreat precision. The plate is then \"proved\" that is, a proof is taken\r\nfrom it on paper and if the proof is satisfactory the plate is nailed\r\nto a block of wood on which it will be \"type high\" (0.918 inch), for\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nMost drawings for zinc etching are made with a pen in black ink and\r\nconsist of lines, dots, or masses of black, but drawings may also be\r\nprepared by using some medium that will produce a fine stipple, such\r\nas a black crayon on rough paper or Ross's stipple paper. (See p. 24.)\r\nThe drawing should be one and one-half to two or three times as large\r\nas the printed illustration, for it is impossible to obtain a\r\nsatisfactory reproduction of a pen and ink drawing without some\r\nreduction. If the drawing has not been reduced the lines appear\r\nheavier in the reproduction than in the drawing, and imperfections\r\nthus become more noticeable; if it has been properly reduced,\r\nimperfections are diminished and the lines and dots become thinner and\r\nfiner than those in the drawing. In making a drawing that is to be\r\nreduced the draftsman can also space his lines farther apart and work\r\nout his details more easily.\r\n\r\nAn author should carefully examine and approve the finished drawings,\r\nwhich can, of course, be greatly altered, if necessary, before they\r\nare engraved; but similar corrections can not be made on proof sheets\r\nof zinc cuts, which should not be marked for alterations except by\r\neliminating parts. Minor changes can be made in such a cut by an\r\nexpert \"finisher,\" but if the cut is small it is generally cheaper to\r\ncorrect the drawing and have a new cut made.\r\n\r\nZinc etchings cost about 10 to 25 cents a square inch, the cost being\r\nvaried according to a standard scale which is based upon the\r\nascertained cost of reproduction. The minimum charge for a single cut\r\nis $2.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER ETCHING IN RELIEF.\r\n\r\nCopper etching, which produces a line cut in relief, requires the same\r\nkind of copy that is most often marked for zinc etching and is used to\r\nobtain deeper etching and a more permanent cut. It is said to produce\r\nbetter printing plates than those etched on zinc and is used largely\r\nfor reproducing script lettering and other fine work. As copper plates\r\nwill hold up longer in printing than zinc, a cut etched on copper may\r\nnot need to be electrotyped.\r\n\r\nThe chemical part of the process is practically the same as that\r\nemployed for etching half-tone plates, described under the next\r\nheading.\r\n\r\nThe cost of etching on copper is considerably greater than the cost of\r\netching on zinc. This process is not often used in reproducing\r\nillustrations for publications of the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALF-TONE ENGRAVING.\r\n\r\nThe half-tone process is, in name at least, familiar to almost\r\neveryone who has had any connection with the making of books, whether\r\nas author, editor, illustrator, or printer. The invention of a\r\nphotomechanical process of reproducing a line drawing to make a metal\r\nplate that could be printed along with type on an ordinary printing\r\npress naturally led to attempts to reproduce similarly a photograph.\r\nIt was known that the intermediate shades between white and black in a\r\nphotograph--the half tones--can be reproduced on an ordinary printing\r\npress only by breaking them up into dots or lines that will form a\r\ngood printing surface and that by their variation in size or density\r\nwill give for each shade the effect of a uniform tone. In the\r\nhalf-tone process this effect is produced by photographing the picture\r\nor object through a screen.\r\n\r\nThe half-tone screen consists of two plates of glass, on each of which\r\nlines running generally at an angle of 45° to the sides of the plate\r\nhave been engraved, cemented together so that the lines cross at\r\nright angles. The lines, which are minute grooves filled with an\r\nopaque black pigment, thus appear as a series of black crossed lines\r\non a white ground. The screen is placed in the camera in front of the\r\nnegative. Screens are made that show from 60 lines to an inch for the\r\ncoarser newspaper illustrations to 250 lines or more to the inch for\r\nfine book work. The screens used for magazine illustrations generally\r\nshow 120 to 150 lines. Those used for Survey publications show 150 to\r\n175 lines, and for reproducing delicate drawings and photographs of\r\nfossils screens bearing 200 lines to the inch are sometimes specified;\r\nbut these finer screens require the use of highly super-coated papers,\r\nsome of them made of cheap fiber and not known to be permanent. For a\r\nhalf tone that is to be printed in the text a 100-line or a 120-line\r\nscreen is specified. (See Pl. VI, p. 56.)\r\n\r\nThe method of etching a half-tone plate does not differ greatly from\r\nthat used in zinc etching, and there are several kinds of half-tone\r\nplates, though most of them are etched on copper, not on zinc, those\r\netched on zinc being used principally for newspaper illustrations. The\r\nhalf-tone screen is used also in other processes to obtain a negative.\r\n\r\nWhen a half-tone negative hag been made the film is stripped from the\r\nglass plate and reversed, as in the zinc-etching process, though some\r\nhalf-tone engravers use a mirror box or prism by which the picture is\r\nso disposed on the negative that it does not need stripping and\r\nreversing. A perfectly flat, clean, and highly polished copper plate,\r\ngenerally large enough to accommodate several such films, is then\r\ncoated with a sensitive film according to one of several formulas, all\r\nbased on the fact that gelatin or some similar body, if sensitized\r\nwith certain chromic salts, becomes hardened and insoluble in water on\r\nexposure to light. This plate is then placed in the printing frame in\r\ncontact, under pressure, with the glass negative plate and is exposed\r\nto light in the usual manner. The copper plate is then removed from\r\nthe frame in the dark room and made ready for etching.\r\n\r\nFor etching half-tone plates on copper a saturated solution of\r\nperchloride of iron is used instead of the solution of nitric acid\r\nused for zinc etching. The time of etching ranges from about 5 to 15\r\nminutes, according to the strength of the solution. One etching is\r\ngenerally sufficient, but it may be necessary to give the plate\r\nanother \"biting\" if it has not been etched deep enough, or to re-etch\r\nit in order to strengthen contrasts. If, for instance, the sky in a\r\nhalf-tone plate shows too dark or is uneven in tint it can be made\r\nlighter or more even by re-etching. On the other hand, if certain\r\nfeatures on a plate are too light they can be darkened by\r\nburnishing--rubbing the surface with a highly polished steel burnisher\r\nunder just sufficient pressure to flatten slightly the fine points\r\nthat form the printing surface of the plate. When the plate leaves the\r\nhands of the etcher it is turned over to the finisher, who with a\r\ngraver removes spots or any other imperfections that may appear on it.\r\nSometimes a roulette is used to lighten parts, and other tools are\r\nused for special purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter a plate that shows two or more pictures has been etched and\r\nfinished it is divided by sawing them apart. Each one is then put into\r\na beveling machine, where its edges are trimmed and the usual border\r\nis made, if it is desired. The separate plates are then ready to be\r\nproved and mounted on blocks of wood which make them type high, ready\r\nfor printing.\r\n\r\nThe half-tone process is used almost exclusively for reproducing\r\nphotographs and wash drawings, though it will produce a facsimile of\r\nany kind of copy, such as impressions from type, old manuscripts, or\r\ntypewriting, but a shade composed of minute black dots will appear\r\nover the entire print and there will be no absolutely whits areas\r\nunless they are produced by routing the plate or cutting out the high\r\nlights. (See p. 74.) The reproduction of an ordinary outdoor\r\nphotograph requires very little handwork, except for re-etching,\r\nburnishing, and cutting the borders. In the reproduction of copy that\r\nis made up of separate parts, such as groups of photographs of\r\nspecimens that are to appear on a white ground, the half-tone\r\n\"tint\"--or more properly shade--between and around the several figures\r\nmust be removed and numbers must be added. This operation requires two\r\nnegatives--one half tone and one line--and produces what is called a\r\n\"combination\" plate. Therefore the difference in the cost of making a\r\nhalf-tone cut from a single photograph of a landscape and from a cut\r\nmade from \"copy\" of the same size consisting of a number of small\r\nphotographs or drawings, to which numbers or letters are added, is\r\nconsiderable (about 50 per cent greater) and depends upon the amount\r\nof additional work involved. Routing, when needed, must be done with\r\nextreme care lest the edges of a figure be marred, and this work\r\nrequires skill that can be gained only by experience.\r\n\r\nCopy for the half-tone process should be as nearly perfect as\r\npossible. Only the best photographs should be selected. Prints on\r\nsemimat velox and glossy haloid papers are regarded as the best\r\nphotographic copy for reproduction. Every part of the photograph or\r\ndrawing should be absolutely clean. If any part that should be pure\r\nwhite becomes soiled or stained the defects will be reproduced. If a\r\nphotograph needs retouching it should be retouched with great care and\r\njust sufficiently to correct defects and to bring out or strengthen\r\nthe important details. In many photographs the skies may be \"muddy\" or\r\nuneven in tone, and this defect can be corrected by the use of an air\r\nbrush, the only medium that will produce an almost even tone. As\r\nalready stated, half-tone plates can be improved by re-etching and\r\ntooling, but tooling tends to destroy the effects of nature and\r\nproduces an artificial appearance in the print. One who is preparing\r\nwash drawings for reproduction by the half-tone process should\r\nremember that brush marks and other inequalities of tone will be\r\nreproduced with as much fidelity as other details. Such drawings\r\nshould therefore be made two or three times larger than the engraved\r\ncut in order to subdue all unnatural effects and to soften the general\r\ntones.\r\n\r\nLine drawings are not generally suitable copy for the half-tone\r\nprocess, but it is occasionally desirable to use that process instead\r\nof zinc etching for reproducing a line drawing that has been\r\ninexpertly prepared if the cost of redrawing would more than offset\r\nthe difference in cost between zinc etching and the more expensive\r\nhalf-tone process. In reproducing a pen drawing by half tone the lines\r\nbecome softened and represent the details and shading only; but the\r\npen drawing may be further developed by brush work. Examples of this\r\ntype of reproduction are Plates V, _A_, VI, _A_, and XV, figure 10,\r\nand other illustrations in Survey Monograph 34.\r\n\r\nVignetting, which consists of a skillful grading off of the edges of a\r\npicture, as well as extensive tooling or hand engraving, is often\r\nemployed for artistic effect but should be specified only for\r\nexceptional illustrations. The plates made for the Survey are either\r\n\"square trimmed\" or the ground tint is entirely omitted or routed\r\naway; they are not usually tooled or vignetted.\r\n\r\nHalf-tone cuts etched on copper cost 20 to 60 cents a square inch, the\r\ncost being varied according to a standard scale based on the\r\nascertained cost of reproduction. Those that require a screen finer\r\nthan 150 lines cost 25 per cent additional. The minimum charge for a\r\nsingle cut is $3.\r\n\r\nHalf tones etched on zinc (100-line screen or coarser) cost 25 per\r\ncent less than those etched on copper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE-COLOR HALF-TONE PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThe three-color process is practically an adaptation of the half-tone\r\nprocess to color printing based on the theory that all colors or hues\r\nin nature can be reproduced by combinations of three colors of the\r\nspectrum--red, blue, and yellow. The process differs from the ordinary\r\nhalf-tone process particularly in the use of color filters in making\r\nthe negatives and in the character of screens and diaphragms used.\r\nThis process, like all others, is worked somewhat differently in\r\ndifferent establishments. In what is called the indirect method, the\r\none most commonly used, twelve photographic operations are necessary\r\nto produce one illustration, or the three plates or cuts from which\r\none illustration is to be reproduced by printing. These twelve\r\noperations produce three chromatic negatives, each representing one\r\ncolor; three transparencies or positives, made from the chromatic\r\nnegatives; three half-tone negatives, made from the positives; and\r\nfinally three contact prints, made on sensitized metal plates. In what\r\nis called the direct method the half-tone screen is placed in front of\r\nthe photographic plate so that it becomes also a half-tone negative\r\nfrom which a print is made on a sensitized metal plate. Thus the\r\nphotographic operations in the direct method are reduced to six, but\r\nthe interference to the passage of light offered by the half-tone\r\nscreen and by the prism used to reverse the image on the negative\r\nlengthens the time of exposure.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no pigments have been found that can reproduce in\r\npurity the colors of the spectrum, and to this fact is due the failure\r\nof the process to reproduce exactly all the colors, tints, and shades\r\nof an original. When a drawing in black on white paper is photographed\r\nonly the white paper affects the negative film. The transparent parts\r\nof the developed negative thus represent the black, and the opaque\r\nparts, which have been acted upon by light, represent the whits.\r\nTheoretically, when a chromatic negative is made for the yellow plate\r\na purple-violet filter cuts out all the yellow and allows the red and\r\nblue rays to affect the plate; when a negative is made for the blue\r\nplate an orange filter similarly cuts out the blue and allows the\r\nyellow and red rays to affect the plate; and when a negative is made\r\nfor the red plate a green filter cuts out the red and permits the blue\r\nand yellow rays to affect the plate. These color filters, which are\r\nusually made of transparent stained gelatin, are generally placed in\r\nfront of the lens. When printing plates like those used in the\r\nhalf-tone process have been made from the three negatives and the\r\nplates have been inked with yellow, blue, and red ink, respectively, a\r\ncombined impression from them will produce a close approximation of\r\nthe subject photographed. The colored inks often used are light\r\nyellow, peacock or prussian blue, and bright, transparent crimson.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary half-tone screen, which bears lines cut at an angle of\r\n45° to the sides of the plate, is rectangular, but the screens used\r\nfor three-color work are made circular in order that they may be\r\nturned in the camera to make the lines intersect at other angles, the\r\nangles being varied to avoid producing an undesirable pattern or a\r\nmoire effect. Turning the screen also prevents the exact coincidence\r\nor superposition of the red, blue, and yellow dots, which would\r\nproduce black. In other respects the screens do not differ essentially\r\nfrom those used in ordinary half-tone work.\r\n\r\nAs special experience is necessary in printing three-color plates the\r\nengraver generally delivers the printed illustrations to the purchaser\r\ninstead of the plates, which he furnishes for other kinds of relief\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nThe copy for this process may consist of anything in color, such as\r\nspecimens, objects, paintings, or properly colored photographs. The\r\nprocess does not usually reproduce all the colors and tints of an\r\noriginal with equal exactness and is not used by the Survey for work\r\nthat demands precise reproduction of color, but it is satisfactory for\r\nreproducing most colored drawings, colored photographs of specimens,\r\nor the specimens themselves if they show individual variations in\r\ncolor. As the process is entirely photomechanical it gives more\r\nscientific accuracy in detail than chromolithography, in which there\r\nis much hand work, and it is much less expensive. If the colors shown\r\nin proofs are not satisfactory they can be modified.\r\n\r\nThe four-color process, in which four color plates are used, gives a\r\ncloser approximation of true color values than the three-color\r\nprocess, and at a comparatively small increase of cost. The additional\r\ncolor used is generally a neutral gray or black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAX ENGRAVING (THE CEROTYPE PROCESS).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wax or cerotype process does not require finished drawings and is\r\nespecially suitable for making text illustrations and small maps,\r\nalthough it may be used also for large work. For this process blue\r\nprints, pencil sketches, old prints, or rough copy of any kind may be\r\nsubmitted--that is, it is not necessary to furnish carefully prepared\r\ndrawings in black ink, as it would be for photo-engraving, for the wax\r\nengraver will reproduce in proper form any illustration in which the\r\ncopy and the instructions show what is wanted, just as an experienced\r\ndraftsman will make a good drawing from the rough original furnished\r\nby an author. Full and clear instructions should always be given,\r\nhowever, as to the size of the cut wanted and what it is to show.\r\n\r\nIn this process a polished copper plate is coated with a film\r\nconsisting of beeswax, a whitening medium, and other ingredients, and\r\nthe coating, which varies in thickness according to the nature of the\r\ncopy, is sensitized as in the ordinary photographic processes. The map\r\nor other design to be engraved is first photographed to publication\r\nsize and a contact print is made on the wax coating from the negative.\r\nThe lines and other parts of the photographed image are then traced or\r\ncut through the wax to the copper plate with steel tools and\r\nstraightened or perfected by the engraver, but the lettering is set in\r\nprinter's type, which is pressed into the wax until it also touches\r\nthe metal plate. After the work of cutting through the wax has been\r\ncompleted the larger open spaces between the lines are \"built up\" by\r\nthe addition of wax to give greater depth to the plate, so that the\r\nwax plate thus built up corresponds to an electrotype mold. The plate\r\nis then dusted with powdered graphite and suspended in a solution\r\ncontaining copper, where by electrolytic action a copper shell is\r\nformed over its surface. When this shell is sufficiently thick it is\r\nremoved from the solution and reinforced on the back with metal, and\r\nproofs are taken from it. If the proofs are satisfactory the plate is\r\nblocked type-high.\r\n\r\nWax-engraved plates may be used for printing colored maps or diagrams,\r\nin which variations of tint are produced by various kinds of machine\r\nrulings. The effect of some of the colors thus produced is almost a\r\n\"flat\" tint, in which a pattern can be detected only by close\r\nscrutiny. Some color work is printed from a wax base plate in\r\ncombination with half-tone color plates.\r\n\r\nThe price of a wax engraving depends entirely on the size of the cut,\r\nthe amount of work involved, and the character of the original copy,\r\nbut it should not exceed very much the cost of a carefully prepared\r\npen drawing plus the cost of a zinc etching made from it. Cuts\r\nengraved by the wax process, like zinc and half-tone plates, are\r\ndelivered to the purchaser. If colored work is ordered, however, the\r\nprinted sheets, not the cuts, are delivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD ENGRAVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWood engraving was once the universal method of producing cuts for\r\nillustrations that were designed to be printed on an ordinary press.\r\nIt is said to be the oldest of all methods of engraving illustrations.\r\nThe engraving is made on a block of boxwood, a very dense, hard wood\r\nof a light-yellow color. The block is cut type-high across the grain,\r\nand the engraving surface is made perfectly smooth by nibbing it with\r\npumice or other stone. When a cut is to be larger than 3 or 4 inches\r\nsquare the wood block is made up of pieces securely dovetailed or\r\njoined together to prevent splitting and warping. A woodcut is not\r\nused for printing but is electrotyped and the electrotype is used in\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\nOriginally the smoothed surface of the wood block was coated with\r\nprepared chalk or Chinese whits, and on this coating a finished\r\ndrawing was made with a brush and pencil by an illustrator. According\r\nto more recent practice the surface of the wood is covered with a\r\nsensitized coating, on which the drawing or design to be engraved is\r\nphotographed. The engraver then, with various kinds of gravers and\r\nother tools, cuts out the parts of the picture that are to be\r\nrepresented by white paper and leaves the lines, dots, and black areas\r\nas a printing surface, thus translating the shades and tints of the\r\npicture into a system of lines and dots which exactly duplicate, in\r\neffect, the details and tones of the original design. In order to\r\nproduce a line effect of an area in which the tone is intermediate\r\nbetween whits and black the engraver must space his lines so that\r\none-half the area will remain as printing surface and the other half\r\nas white spaces, and he must give character and direction to his\r\nlines, so that, if he is skillful, he can reproduce not only the\r\ndelicate tones but the texture and details of the original picture.\r\nMany wood engravers became noted for their artistic rendering of\r\nmagazine illustrations, of famous paintings, and of other works of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThe Survey began to abandon this method of engraving in 1884, when the\r\nSixth Annual Report was in press, substituting for it the cheaper\r\nphotomechanical processes, zinc etching and half-tone engraving, and\r\nentirely abandoned its use in 1892.\r\n\r\nMany good examples of wood engraving may be found in the early\r\nmonographs and annual reports of the Geological Survey. Monograph 2\r\ncontains numerous examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGELATIN PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBichromatized gelatin is used in several photomechanical processes of\r\nreproducing illustrations, but in the photogelatin processes the\r\ngelatin not only receives the image by exposure to light through a\r\nnegative but becomes a printing surface on a plate from which prints\r\nare made somewhat as in lithography. The several photogelatin\r\nprocesses are much the same as the original collotype process and are\r\nbest known by the names collotype, heliotype, albertype, artotype, and\r\nthe German name lichtdruck.\r\n\r\nIn working these processes a thick plate of glass, after certain\r\npreliminary treatment, is coated with sensitized gelatin. The plate is\r\nthen placed in a drying room or oven having a temperature of 120° F.,\r\nbaked until it is thoroughly dry, and allowed to cool gradually. The\r\nsubject to be reproduced is then photographed in the usual manner, and\r\nunless a prism or mirror box has been used the negative is stripped\r\nand reversed in order to make the print reproduce the original in\r\nproper position. From the negative a contact print is made on the\r\ngelatin-coated plate, the parts or molecules of gelatin being hardened\r\nin proportion to the amount of light that affects them. After the\r\ncontact print has been made the gelatin plate is thoroughly washed in\r\ncold water, in order to dissolve and wash out the bichromate and stop\r\nany further action of light on the plate, and is then thoroughly\r\ndried. Before prints are made from the gelatin-coated plate water is\r\nflowed on it and penetrates different parts of the gelatin according\r\nto their hardness. The darkest parts of the picture will correspond to\r\nthe hardest and densest parts of the gelatin, which will not absorb\r\nwater; the lighter parts will take up more water. The surface water\r\nis then removed with a rubber straight edge and an absorbent roller\r\nand the plate is ready for inking. The ink, being greasy, has no\r\naffinity for water, and when it is rolled over the plate it adheres\r\nonly to the dry parts of the gelatin, and in the press is carried to\r\nthe paper in all the lights and shades of the illustration. The plate\r\nis kept moist in printing.\r\n\r\nThe paper used for printing from photogelatin plates must be free from\r\nchemicals that will affect the gelatin. A nearly pure rag paper is\r\ngenerally used.\r\n\r\nThe photogelatin process is well adapted to the reproduction of\r\npaleontologic drawings, wash drawings, photographs, photomicrographs,\r\nworks of art, old manuscripts--in fact, any kind of subject in which\r\nthe reproduction of delicate lights and shades is essential. If\r\nproperly manipulated it has distinct advantages over the half-tone\r\nprocess in that it can reproduce details and light and shade without\r\nshowing the effect of a screen and without the use of coated paper.\r\nExcellent reproductions by the heliotype process are also made in\r\ncolor by first printing the design in a neutral tone and superposing\r\nappropriate transparent colors on this print, somewhat as in\r\nchromolithography, so that the colors softly blend with the shaded\r\ngroundwork.\r\n\r\nReproductions made by the photogelatin process are more expensive than\r\nthose made by the half-tone process, for the prints are generally made\r\non better paper and are printed with greater care. They give no screen\r\neffect and are perhaps unrivaled by prints obtained by any other\r\nprocess except photogravure, in which the image is printed from a\r\nmetal plate that has been sensitized, exposed under a reversed\r\nnegative, and etched.\r\n\r\nChanges can not be made on photogelatin plates except by making over\r\nthe corrected parts. All retouching must be done on the originals or\r\non the negatives made from then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITHOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThe general term \"lithography\" is sometimes used to indicate not only\r\nthe original process so named, said to have been invented by\r\nSenefelder, but chromolithography, photolithography, and engraving on\r\nstone, as well as engraving on copper as a means of supplying matter\r\nto be transferred to and printed from a lithographic stone.\r\n\r\nSenefelder discovered that limestone will absorb either grease or\r\nWater, and that neither one will penetrate a part of the surface\r\npreviously affected by the other. He found that if a design is drawn\r\non limestone with a greasy crayon and the stone afterward properly\r\nprepared with a solution of nitric acid and gum, greasy ink will\r\nadhere only to the parts that are covered with the crayon, and that\r\nthe stone will give off an impression of the design.\r\n\r\nLithographic stone is described as a fine, compact, homogeneous\r\nlimestone, which may be either a pure carbonate of lime or\r\ndolomitic--that is, it may contain magnesium. Although limestone is\r\none of the most common rocks, limestone of a quality suitable for use\r\nin lithography is found at only a few localities.[11] There are two\r\ngeneral classes of lithographic stone, known to the trade as \"blue\" or\r\nhard stone and \"yellow\" or soft stone. The blue stone is adapted for\r\nengraving and to the better grade of fine-line printing; the yellow\r\nstone is rated as somewhat inferior.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Kubel, S. J., Lithographic stone: U. S. Geol. Survey\r\nMineral Resources, 1900, pp. 869-873, 1901.]\r\n\r\nIn the original process, which may here be termed plain lithography,\r\ntwo methods are employed in putting on stone the design to be\r\nreproduced. In one the subject or picture to be reproduced is drawn on\r\nthe printing stone either with a lithographic crayon or with a pen\r\ndipped in lithographic ink or \"tusche,\" which is oily or fatty, like\r\nthe crayon. In the other method the drawing is made on transfer paper\r\nand transferred to the stone. In drawing on stone it is necessary to\r\nreverse the design, so that all lettering must be drawn backward. In\r\ndoing this the artist often uses a mirror to aid him. If the drawing\r\nis made on transfer paper the design and the lettering are copied as\r\nin the original--not reversed.\r\n\r\nBefore a drawing is made on stone a stone of the quality suited to the\r\nparticular design in hand is selected. The stone is then ground and\r\npolished, and if the drawing is to be made with crayon it is \"grained\"\r\naccording to the special requirements of the subject. If the drawing\r\nis to be made with a pen and is to consist of \"line work\" the stone is\r\npolished. The first step is to obtain on the stone an outline or\r\n\"faint\" of the design. There are several ways to do this. By one\r\nmethod a tracing of the design is made, a sheet of thin paper covered\r\nwith red chalk is laid face downward on the stone, the tracing is laid\r\nface downward over it, and the design is again traced in red-chalk\r\nlines on the stone. The method described is simple, but there are\r\nothers that are more complicated and that are particularly applicable\r\nto the reproduction of photographs and other illustrations. Crayon\r\nwork is often used in combination with pen and ink, stipple, and brush\r\nwork. This method of drawing on stone is used also for preparing color\r\nstones in the process of chromolithography, in which there are many\r\nadded details of manipulation. After the drawing has been made on the\r\nstone or transferred to it the stone is \"gummed\"--that is, it is\r\ncovered with a solution of gum arabic and nitric acid--and dried. The\r\nstone is then dampened with water and carefully rolled with\r\nlithographic ink, which adheres to the pen or crayon work and is\r\nrepelled elsewhere. It is then \"rubbed\" over with powdered rosin and\r\ntalcum, which adheres to the ink and further protects the drawing from\r\nthe effects of the etching fluid, which is next to be applied to the\r\nstone. This fluid consists of a 10 per cent solution of gum arabic to\r\nwhich 2 to 7 per cent of nitric acid has been added, the degree of\r\nacidity being varied according to the subject and the hardness of the\r\nstone. The fluid is applied with a brush or sponge and is left on the\r\nstone just long enough to decompose slightly the carbonate of lime on\r\nits surface and, after washing, to leave the design or drawing in very\r\nslight relief. The stone is again gummed and dried, and the design is\r\n\"washed out\" or brought out by removing the surface gum with a wet\r\nsponge and applying to the stone a rag sprinkled with turpentine and\r\ncharged with printing ink. These operations wash away the tusche and\r\nthe crayon that have been decomposed by the acid and expose the design\r\nfaintly in white at first, but it gradually grows darker as it becomes\r\ncharged with printing ink from the rag. The stone is next \"rolled up\"\r\nor inked. The slightly moistened surface repels the ink and the design\r\ntakes it up, so that when the stone is run through the press the\r\ndesign is carried to the paper.\r\n\r\nLithographic prints from stones prepared in this way are made on a\r\nflat-bed press. The stone is carried forward to print and on its\r\nreturn is dampened and inked, an operation slower than that of rotary\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nCorrections and changes are made on the stone by carefully scraping or\r\npolishing away the parts to be corrected and making the changes with a\r\ncrayon or pen, but the design can not ordinarily be corrected twice in\r\nthe same place, as the scraping or polishing removes a part of the\r\nsurface of the stone and thus lessens the pressure at that place, and\r\nthe impression there may be imperfect or may completely fail.\r\n\r\nThis form of lithography is seldom used for Survey illustrations but\r\nwas formerly much used and is well adapted to the reproduction of\r\ndrawings of fossils, particularly of remains of dinosaurs and other\r\ntypes of large extinct animals. Examples may be seen in Monographs 8\r\nand 10 and in other early reports of the Geological Survey. The\r\ndrawings for these illustrations were made directly on stone.\r\n\r\nA drawing made on one stone may be transferred in duplicate or in any\r\ndesired number to another stone, or to a properly grained sheet of\r\nzinc and aluminum, from which impressions may be printed on a\r\nlithographic press. Both these metals are also used for lithographic\r\nprinting on rotary presses, the zinc or aluminum plate being bent and\r\nsecured around a cylinder which rotates continuously in one direction.\r\nAs one impression is made at each revolution of the cylinder the\r\nprinting is rapid; but the best printing from a metal plate is\r\ninferior to the best printing from a lithographic stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOLITHOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nPhotolithography, like other lithographic processes, has been improved\r\ngreatly during the last few years--not particularly in results but in\r\nmethods--by the introduction of metal plates, the rubber blanket\r\noffset, the Ben Day films, and many mechanical and chemical devices,\r\nso that a brief description of it will not explain the process except\r\nin a most general way. As photolithography is a direct process and is\r\nrelatively cheap it is the one most used for reproducing large maps\r\nand other line drawings that have been carefully prepared. Zinc and\r\naluminum plates are now much used in photolithography, for a direct\r\ncontact photographic print can be made on them, they can be printed\r\nflat or bent for use on a rotary press, and they can be stored for\r\nfuture use more economically than stones.\r\n\r\nThere are two somewhat distinct methods of producing photolithographs.\r\nIn both the ordinary photographic methods are used, but it is often\r\nnecessary to \"cut\" or trace parts of the negative in order to open up\r\nlines and other features that are not sharp or well defined, so that\r\nthe negative will print them sharp and clear. If the copy to be\r\nreproduced shows three colors, three negatives are made, one for each\r\ncolor, and the parts to be shown by each are preserved by \"opaquing\"\r\nor painting out all other parts. By the older method the negative thus\r\nperfected is placed in a printing frame in contact, under pressure,\r\nwith sensitized transfer paper and is exposed to light. The printing\r\nframe is then carried to the dark room and the paper is removed from\r\nthe frame and its surface covered with transfer ink. The paper is then\r\nlaid face upward on water and soaked for several minutes, after which\r\nit is placed in the same position upon a slab of stone or metal and\r\nthoroughly washed with water. This washing removes the ink and the\r\nsensitive film from the parts that were unaffected by the action of\r\nlight (the parts corresponding to the white paper in the design), but\r\nthe ink still adheres to the lines of the design in the precise\r\nsharpness and clearness of the negative. The design is now ready to be\r\ntransferred to the printing stone or zinc plate. The sheet is again\r\nslightly dampened between moist blotters and laid face downward in its\r\ncorrect position on a prepared stone or zinc plate, which is then\r\npulled through a press under heavy pressure. The paper is then removed\r\nfrom the stone or plate, to which it has carried the design. From this\r\npoint the gumming, etching, and other operations are practically the\r\nsame as those used in ordinary lithography.\r\n\r\nThe bichromate-gelatin transfer process described above has been\r\nreplaced in the Survey by a more satisfactory one, which insures\r\nabsolute scale and reproduces the finest line drawings perfectly\r\nwithout thickening the lines or without distortion. In this process,\r\nwhich is known as the planographic process, a photographic negative of\r\nthe \"copy\" is placed in a vacuum printing frame in contact with a zinc\r\nor aluminum plate that has been sensitized with a bichromate-albumen\r\nsolution and exposed in front of an arc lamp. After proper exposure\r\nthe plate is removed from the frame, inked over, and placed under\r\nwater. The parts not hardened by the action of light (the unexposed\r\nparts) are then rubbed away with cotton, and the plate is chemically\r\netched, gummed over, and dried. The plate is then ready to be printed\r\nfrom in a lithographic press. If a large map is to be reproduced it is\r\nphotographed in parts, and contact prints are made on zinc plates.\r\nFrom these plates transfers are pulled and the parts are assembled and\r\nlaid down in proper position on a stone or an aluminum plate, which is\r\nthen prepared for printing.\r\n\r\nA drawing that is to be reproduced by photolithography should be made\r\non pure-white paper in lines, dots, or black masses with black\r\nwaterproof ink. It should be one and one-half to two or three times\r\nthe size of the finished print.\r\n\r\nPhotolithography is particularly adapted to the reproduction of maps,\r\nplans, and other large drawings. Within certain limitations, lines may\r\nbe changed and details may be added after proofs have been submitted.\r\nThe process is ordinarily used for reproducing illustrations in one\r\ncolor (black), but it is used also for printing in more than one\r\ncolor, generally over a black outline base, each color being printed\r\nfrom a separate stone, as in chromolithography.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFSET PRINTING.\r\n\r\nIn the offset process the design is \"offset\" from a lithographic plate\r\nor stone to a rubber blanket on a cylinder, from which it is printed.\r\nBy thus obtaining an impression from an elastic surface the finest\r\ndetails can be printed on rough, uncoated paper, which can not be used\r\nin other processes, which can be folded without danger of breaking,\r\nand which is more durable than coated paper. Plates II, III, IV, VII,\r\nand VIII in this pamphlet were printed by this process.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROMOLITHOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe chromolithographic process, by which illustrations are printed in\r\ncolor from stone, is used in Survey publications principally for\r\nreproducing geologic maps, but it is sometimes used for reproducing\r\ncolored drawings of specimens.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of color printing from stones. One produces a\r\npicture by superimposing colors that combine and overlap without\r\ndefinite outlines and thus reproduce the softly blended colors of the\r\noriginal. Another reproduces the original by printing colors within\r\ndefinite outlines on a \"base\" which has been previously printed in\r\nblack. The first kind is used by the Survey for reproducing colored\r\ndrawings of specimens. The second is followed in reproducing geologic\r\nmaps.\r\n\r\nAs each color must be printed from a separate stone and properly\r\nfitted with respect to the others a tracing from the original is made\r\nof the precise outlines of each color; or, if the design is to be\r\nreduced, a tracing is made over a properly reduced photographic print.\r\nThis tracing can be made on specially prepared tracing paper or on a\r\nsheet of transparent gelatin or celluloid, which is laid over the copy\r\nand on which all the outlines and overlaps of the various colors are\r\nscratched with a steel point. The scratches thus made on the celluloid\r\nare filled with red chalk or like substance, and rubbed in with\r\ncotton, and by reversing the sheet and rubbing it the chalk lines are\r\ndeposited on as many stones as are needed to produce the colors of the\r\noriginal design, each stone bearing all the outlines of the design.\r\nSometimes all the outlines are engraved on what is called a key stone\r\nand an impression from it is laid down on each of the color stones.\r\nThe parts on each stone that are to have one color are then inked in\r\nor engraved, and at the same time guide marks are indicated, so that\r\nin the composite print from the stones each color will fit its proper\r\nplace. This fitting is called \"register\" and is an important part of\r\nprinting, for each stone must be adjusted to a nicety while on the\r\npress in order to make each impression fit the others exactly. The\r\nprocess was originally manipulated entirely by hand, but photography\r\nhas now replaced much of the handwork and has given rise to several\r\nmethods by which the same kinds of subjects are reproduced in\r\nradically different ways. Tints are sometimes produced by the\r\nhalf-tone and other screens and by machine ruling, and printer's type\r\nis used almost exclusively for titles and other matter that was\r\nformerly engraved or drawn on the stone.\r\n\r\nIn reproducing a geologic map the base may be engraved on stone or on\r\ncopper or it may be photo-lithographed. By either process the map may\r\nbe transferred to the printing stone. The color stones for geologic\r\nmaps are prepared by hand, but the geologic patterns, which are\r\nprinted in colors, are engraved separately on plates, from which\r\nimpressions are pulled when needed and transferred to their proper\r\nplaces on the printing stones in the shapes required according to the\r\n\"key\" design. The lighter, more transparent colors are generally\r\nprinted first, and often twelve or more colors and many distinctive\r\npatterns are used to produce a geologic map. When proofs of such a map\r\nare pulled each stone must be taken up and carefully adjusted on the\r\npress, so that the work of proving maps that are printed from a\r\nconsiderable number of color stones is laborious and expensive.\r\nIt is therefore customary to approve first combined proofs\r\nconditionally--that is, subject to the corrections and changes\r\nindicated on the proofs--and to hold the lithographer responsible for\r\nany failure to make the corrections.\r\n\r\nThis process is the most expensive one used for reproducing\r\nillustrations. Changes may be indicated on proofs, but changes can not\r\nbe made on a stone twice in the same place without danger of affecting\r\nthe printing or making it necessary to retransfer the parts affected.\r\nAll changes are expensive because a slight modification at one point\r\nmay involve corresponding changes on a number of stones, each of which\r\nmust be taken up, corrected, and proved to insure the exact\r\ncoincidence of the parts affected. It is often less expensive to\r\nretransfer the entire job than to make extensive changes on the\r\noriginal stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGRAVING ON STONE AND ON COPPER.\r\n\r\nEngraving on stone is distinctly lithographic, but engraving on copper\r\nis sometimes included among lithographic processes because the work\r\nproduced by it is usually printed from stone and thus becomes\r\nlithographic. In other respects engraving on copper is not a\r\nlithographic process. Roughly prepared maps and any rough line copy\r\nthat is accurate in statement and clear as to intent are appropriate\r\nfor both methods of engraving, but drawings that are expertly prepared\r\nare more suitable for reproduction by photolithography. In engraving\r\non stone the lines of a design are scratched on the blackened surface\r\nof a stone with a steel-pointed tool; in engraving on copper the lines\r\nare cut with a graver on a sheet or plate of copper, the matter to be\r\nengraved being first shown on the plate by what is called the\r\nphoto-tracing process, which was devised in the Geological Survey.\r\nThere is, however, no great or essential difference in the printed\r\nresults of the two processes, but most lithographers employ only stone\r\nengravers.\r\n\r\nA stone on which a design is to be engraved is ground and polished\r\naccording to the kind of work to be engraved, is coated with a thin\r\nsolution of gum arable and allowed to dry, and is then washed until\r\nthe superficial gum is removed while the surface pores remain filled.\r\nAs the lines made by the engraver must be visible the stone is\r\nblackened with a pigment composed of lampblack and gum or is covered\r\nevenly with red chalk or Venetian red. It is then ready to receive the\r\ndesign to be engraved.\r\n\r\nIf the design is a map which is to show culture, streams, and surface\r\ncontours, and each of these sets of features is to be printed in a\r\nseparate color, impressions of the work to be engraved must be placed\r\non three stones. One method of doing this is to make a scratch tracing\r\nof the original drawing on a sheet of transparent gelatin or celluloid\r\nin the manner employed in chromolithography, except that a dry\r\npigment, generally chrome-yellow, is used to fill the scratch lines\r\ninstead of red chalk or Venetian red. From this tracing a \"faint\" or\r\nimprint of all the details of the three separate features of the map\r\nis made on each of the three stones, and the engraver then cuts on\r\neach stone only the lines and other features, including ample register\r\nmarks, that are to be printed in one color, the imprint made from the\r\ntracing making it possible to engrave each set of features in its\r\nexact position relative to the other two. By another method the matter\r\nto be engraved is photographed directly on the stone.\r\n\r\nThe engraving is done with a steel needle inserted in a small wooden\r\ncylinder, an instrument resembling an ordinary lead pencil. The size\r\nand shape of the needles used are varied according to the requirements\r\nof the matter to be engraved. With this instrument the lines and\r\nlettering are lightly scratched into the stone through the dark\r\ncoating and show as light lines. The points of some of the needles are\r\nfine; those of others are V-shaped; and some have spoon-shaped points,\r\nfor use in thickening lines and shading letters. All features are\r\nengraved in reverse.\r\n\r\nAfter the engraving is completed the stones are prepared for printing\r\nby wiping off all the superficial color and filling the engraved lines\r\nwith a greasy ink--generally a thin printing ink--which is rubbed into\r\nthe lines with a soft rag. Impressions are then pulled on transfer\r\npaper and transferred to three printing stones for use in printing the\r\nthree colors, the register marks enabling the pressman to fit each\r\ncolor exactly in its proper place.\r\n\r\nIn all lithographic processes the titles and other marginal lettering\r\ncan be and usually are transferred from type impressions to the\r\nprinting stones. It is therefore unnecessary to letter such matter\r\ncarefully on an original drawing that is made for lithographic\r\nreproduction, for appropriate faces of type will give better printed\r\nresults than hand lettering.\r\n\r\nCorrections can not be made on a stone or copper engraving as readily\r\nas on a drawing. If a stone engraver makes an error or if a change is\r\nrequired after his engraving is finished, the parts to be corrected\r\nmust be scraped off and a new ground laid before the correction can be\r\nmade. Sometimes he will engrave the parts corrected on another part of\r\nthe original stone and transfer it to the printing stone. Corrections\r\nare made on copper plates by \"hammering up\" the plate from beneath,\r\npolishing off a new surface, and reengraving the part to be corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter given in this appendix is much used in making geologic maps\r\nand other illustrations.
