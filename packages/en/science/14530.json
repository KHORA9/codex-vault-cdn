When Mr. Ketchum joined him in the library, where he was jotting\r\ndown \"the _sobriquets_ of the American States and cities,\" and told him\r\nof the Niagara plan, his ruddy visage beamed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"A delightful idea. Capital,\" he said. \"I suppose I can read up a bit\r\nabout it before we start, and not go there with my eyes shut.\r\nNi-a-ga-rah,--monstrously soft and pretty name. Isn't there something on\r\nyour shelves that would give me the information I want? But we can come\r\nto that presently. Just now I want to find out, if I can, how these\r\nnicknames came to be given. They must have originated in some great\r\npopular movement, eh? I thought I saw my way, as, for example, the\r\n'Empire State' and the 'Crescent City' and some others, but this 'Sucker\r\nState,' now, and 'Buckeye' business,--what may that mean in plain\r\nEnglish?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ketchum shed what light he could on these interesting questions, and\r\nSir Robert thoughtfully ran his hands through his side-whiskers, while,\r\nwith an apologetic \"One moment, I beg,\" or \"Very odd, very; that must go\r\ndown verbatim,\" he entered the gist of Mr. Ketchum's queer remarks in\r\nhis note-book.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he rose with Niagara in his soul. He had more\r\nquestions to ask at the breakfast-table than anybody could answer, and\r\nwas eager to be off. Mr. Ketchum, who had that week made no less than\r\nfifty thousand dollars by a lucky investment, was in high spirits.\r\nCaptain Kendall, who had been allowed to join the party, was vastly\r\npleased by the prospect of another week in Ethel's society. Mrs. Sykes\r\nwas tired of Fairfield, and longed to be \"on the move\" again, as she\r\nfrankly said. So that, altogether, it was a merry company that finally\r\nset off.\r\n\r\nThe very first view of \"the ocean unbound\" increased their pleasure to\r\nenthusiasm. Mrs. Sykes, without reservation, admitted that it was \"a\r\ngrand spot,\" and felt as though she were giving the place a certificate\r\nwhen she added, \"_Quite_ up to the mark.\" She was out on the Suspension\r\nBridge, making a sketch, as soon as she could get there; she took one\r\nfrom every other spot about the place; and when tired of her pencil, she\r\nstalked about with her hammer, chipping off bits of rock that promised\r\ngeological interest. But she found her greatest amusement in the brides\r\nthat \"infested the place\" (to quote from her letter to her sister\r\nCaroline), indulged in much satirical comment on them, and, choosing one\r\nfoolish young rustic who was there as her text, wrote in her diary,\r\n\"American brides like to go from the altar to some large hotel, where\r\nthey can display their finery, wear their wedding-dresses every evening,\r\nand attract as much attention as possible. The national passion for\r\ndisplay makes them delight in anything that renders them conspicuous, no\r\nmatter how vulgar that display may be. If one must have a fools'\r\nparadise, generally known as a honeymoon, this is about as pleasant a\r\nplace as any other for it; and, as there are several runaway couples\r\nstopping here, and the place is just on the border, this is doubtless\r\nthe American Gretna Green, where silly women and temporarily-infatuated\r\nmen can marry in haste, to repent at leisure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Heathcote gave his camera enough to do, as may be imagined. He and\r\nSir Robert traced the Niagara River from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, and\r\nphotographed it at every turn, made careful estimates of its length,\r\nbreadth, depth, the flow of currents, scale of descent to the mile, wear\r\nof precipice, and time necessary for the river to retire from the falls\r\nbusiness altogether and meander tranquilly along on a level like other\r\nrivers. They arrayed themselves in oil-skin suits and spent an\r\nunconscionable time at the back of the Horseshoe Fall, roaring out\r\nobservations about it that were rarely heard, owing to the deafening\r\ndin, and had more than one narrow escape from tumbling into the water in\r\nthese expeditions. They carefully bottled some of it, which they\r\nafterward carefully sealed with red wax and duly labelled, intending to\r\nadd it to a collection of similar phials which Sir Robert had made of\r\nfamous waters in many countries. They went over the mills and factories\r\nin the neighborhood, and Sir Robert had long confabs with the managers,\r\nof whom he asked permission to \"jot down\" the interesting facts\r\ndeveloped in the course of their conversations, surprising them by his\r\nknowledge of mechanics and the subjects in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Man alive! what do you want with _those_?\" said he to one of them, a\r\nkeen-faced young fellow, who was showing him the boiler-fires. He\r\npointed with his stick as he spoke, and rattled it briskly about the\r\nbrick-work by way of accompaniment as he went on: \"Such a waste of\r\nforce, of money! downright stupidity! You don't want it. You don't need\r\nit, any more than you need an hydraulic machine tacked to the back of\r\nyour trains. You have got water enough running past your very door to--\"\r\n\r\n\"I've told that old fool Glass that a thousand times,\" broke in the\r\nyoung man; \"but if he wants to try and warm and light the world with a\r\ngas-stove when the sun is up I guess it's no business of mine, though it\r\ndoes rile me to see the power thrown away and good coal wasted. If I had\r\nthe capital, here's what _I_'d do. Here.\"\r\n\r\nSeizing Sir Robert's stick, the enthusiast drew a fondly-loved ideal\r\nmill in the coal-dust at his feet, while Sir Robert looked and listened,\r\ndiffered, suggested, with keen interest, and Mr. Heathcote gave but\r\nhaughty and ignorant attention to the talk that followed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the way of it; but Glass has lived all his life with his\r\nhead in a bag, and he can't see it. I am surprised to see you take an\r\ninterest in it. Ever worked at it?\" said the man in conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"A little,\" said Sir Robert affably, who could truthfully have said as\r\nmuch of anything. \"Who is this Glass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's the man that owns all this; the stupidest owl that ever lived.\r\nI wish he could catch on like you. I'd like very well to work with you,\"\r\nwas the reply.\r\n\r\n\"A bumptious fellow, that,\" commented Mr. Heathcote when they left.\r\n\"He'd 'like to work with you,' indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"A fellow with ideas. I'd like to work with him,\" replied his uncle;\r\n\"though he isn't burdened with respect for his employers.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Noel meanwhile tied on her large straw hat, took her cane, basket,\r\ntrowel, tin box, and, followed by Parsons with her sketching-apparatus,\r\nwent off to hunt plants or wash in sketches, a most blissfully occupied\r\nand preoccupied old lady.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Ketchum's great amusement, Miss Noel, Mrs. Sykes, and Mr.\r\nHeathcote all arrived at a particular spot within a few moments of each\r\nother one morning, all alike prepared and determined to get the view it\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\nMiss Noel had said to Job _en route,_ \"Do you think that I shall be able\r\nto get a fly and drive about the country a bit? I should so like it. Are\r\nthey to be had there?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he had replied, \"You will have some difficulty in _not_ taking 'a\r\nfly' there, I guess. The hackmen would rather drive your dead body\r\naround town for nothing than let you enjoy the luxury of walking about\r\nunmolested. But I will see to all that.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a carriage had been placed at their disposal, and they had\r\ntaken some charming drives, in the course of which Parsons, occupying\r\nthe box on one occasion, was seen to be peering very curiously about\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"A great pity, is it not, Parsons, that we can't see all this in the\r\nautumn, when the thickets of scarlet and gold are said to be so very\r\nbeautiful?\" said Miss Noel, addressing her affably.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mem,\" agreed Parsons. \"And, if you please, mem, where are the\r\nestates of the gentry, as I 'ave been lookin' for ever since we came\r\nhover?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in this part,\" replied Miss Noel. \"The red Indians were here not\r\nvery long since. You should really get a pin-cushion of their\r\ndescendants, those mild, dirty creatures that work in bark and beads.\r\nBuy of one that has been baptized: one shouldn't encourage them to\r\nremain heathens, you know. Your friends in England will like to see\r\nsomething made by them; and they were once very powerful and spread all\r\nover the country as far as--as--I really forget where; but I know they\r\nwere very wild and dreadful, and lived in wigwams, and wore moccasins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed, mem!\" responded Parsons, impressed by the extent of her\r\nmistress's information.\r\n\r\n\"A wigwam is three upright poles, such as the gypsies use for their\r\nkettles, thatched with the leaves of the palm and the plantain,\" Miss\r\nNoel went on. \"Dear me! It is very odd! I certainly remember to have\r\nread that; but perhaps I am getting back to the Southern Americans\r\nagain, which does so vex Robert. I wonder if one couldn't see a wigwam\r\nfor one's self? It can't be plantain, after all: there is none growing\r\nabout here.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked Mabel about this that evening, and the latter told her husband\r\nhow Miss Noel was always mixing up the two continents.\r\n\r\n\"I don't despair, Mabel. They will find this potato-patch of ours after\r\na while,\" he said good-humoredly.\r\n\r\nBut he was less amiable when Mrs. Sykes said at dinner next day, \"I\r\nshould like to try your maize. Quite simply boiled, and eaten with\r\nbutter and salt, I am told it is quite good, really. I have heard that\r\nthe Duke of Slumborough thought it excellent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say so! I am so glad to hear it! I shall make it generally\r\nknown as far as I can. Such things encourage us to go on trying to make\r\na nation of ourselves. It would have paralyzed all growth and\r\ndevelopment in this country for twenty years if he had thought it\r\n'nasty,'\" said Job. \"Foreigners can't be too particular how they express\r\ntheir opinions about us. Over and over again we have come within an ace\r\nof putting up the shutters and confessing that it was no use pretending\r\nthat we could go on independently having a country of our own, with\r\ndistinct institutions, peculiarities, customs, manners, and even\r\nproductions. It would be so much better and easier to turn ourselves\r\nover to a syndicate of distinguished foreigners who would govern us\r\nproperly,--stamp out ice-water and hot rolls from the first, as unlawful\r\nand not agreeing with the Constitution, give us cool summers, prevent\r\nchildren from teething hard, make it a penal offence to talk through the\r\nnose, and put a bunch of Bourbons in the White House, with a divine\r\nright to all the canvas-back ducks in the country. There are so many\r\nkings out of business now that they could easily give us a bankrupt one\r\nto put on our trade dollar, or something really _sweet_ in emperors who\r\nhave seen better days. And a standing army of a hundred thousand men,\r\nall drum-majors, in gorgeous uniforms, helmets, feathers, gold lace,\r\nwould certainly scare the Mexicans into caniptious and unconditional\r\nsurrender. The more I think of it, the more delightful it seems. It is\r\nmere stupid obstinacy our people keeping up this farce of\r\nself-government, when anybody can see that it is a perfect failure, and\r\nthat the country has no future whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you talk in that way; but I don't think you would really like it,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Sykes. \"Americans seem to think that they know everything:\r\nthey are above taking any hints from the Old World, and get as angry as\r\npossible with me when I point out a few of the more glaring defects that\r\nstrike me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am surprised at that. Our great complaint is that we can't get any\r\nadvice from Europeans. If we only had a little, even, we might in time\r\nloom up as a fifth-rate power. But no: they leave us over here in this\r\nwilderness without one word of counsel or criticism, or so much as a\r\nsuggestion, and they ought not to be surprised that we are going to the\r\ndogs. What else can they expect?\" said Mr. Ketchum.\r\n\r\n\"Husband, dear, you were very sharp with my cousin to-day, and it was\r\nnot like you to show temper,--at least, not temper exactly, but\r\nvexation,\" said Mabel to him afterward in mild rebuke. \"She has told me\r\nthat you quite detest the English, so that she wonders you should have\r\nmarried me. And I said that you were far too intelligent and just to\r\ncherish wrong feelings toward any people, much less my people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if _she_ represented England I should drop England quietly over\r\nthe rapids some day when I could no longer stand her infernal\r\npatronizing, impertinent airs, and rid the world of a nuisance,\" said\r\nMr. Ketchum, with energy. \"Excuse my warmth, but that woman would poison\r\na prairie for me. Fortunately, I happen to know that she only represents\r\na class which neither Church nor State there has the authority to shoot,\r\n_yet_, and I am not going to cry down white wool because there are black\r\nsheep. Look at Sir Robert, and Miss Noel, and all the rest of them, how\r\ndifferent they are.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Kendall certainly found Niagara delightful, for, owing to the\r\nabsorption of the party in their different pursuits, he was able to see\r\nmore of Ethel than he had ever done. He was so different from the men\r\nshe had known that he was a continual study to her. Instead of the\r\nstudied indifference, shy avoidance, shy advances, culminating in a\r\nblunt and straightforward declaration of \"intentions,\" which she would\r\nhave thought natural in an admirer, followed by transparent, honest\r\ndelight in the event of acceptance, or manly submission to the\r\ninevitable in the event of rejection, Captain Kendall had surprised her\r\nby liking her immediately, or at least by showing that he did, and\r\nseeking her persistently, without any pretence of concealment. He talked\r\nto her of politics, of social questions in the broadest sense, of books,\r\nscientific discoveries, his travels, and the travels of others. He read\r\nwhole volumes of poetry to her. He discoursed by the hour on the manly\r\ncharacter, its faults, merits, peculiarities, and possibilities, and\r\nthen contrasted it with the womanly one, trait for trait, and it seemed\r\nto her that women had never been praised so eloquently,\r\nenthusiastically, copiously. At no time was he in the least choked by\r\nhis feelings or at a loss for a fresh word or sentiment. Such romance,\r\nsuch ideality, such universality, as it were, she had never met. When\r\nhis admiration was most unbridled it seemed to be offered to her as the\r\nrepresentative of a sex entirely perfect and lovely. Everything in\r\nheaven and earth, apparently, ministered to his passion and made him\r\ntalk all around the beloved subject with a wealth of simile and\r\nsuggestion that she had never dreamed of. But, if he gave full\r\nexpression to his agitated feelings in these ways, he was extremely\r\ndelicate, respectful, reserved, in others. He wrapped up his heart in so\r\nmany napkins, indeed, that, being a practical woman not extraordinarily\r\ngifted in the matter of imagination, she frequently lost sight of it\r\naltogether, and she sometimes failed to follow him in a broad road of\r\nsentiment that (like the Western ones which Longfellow has described)\r\nnarrowed and narrowed until it disappeared, a mere thread, up a tree. If\r\nhe looked long, after one of these flights, at her sweet English face to\r\nsee what impression he had made, he was often forced to see that it was\r\nnot the one he had meant to make at all.\r\n\r\n\"Is anything amiss?\" she asked once, in her cool, level tone, fixing\r\nupon him her sincerely honest eyes. \"Are there blacks on my nose?\"\r\nAlthough she had distinctly refused him at Kalsing, as became a girl\r\ndestitute of vanity and coquetry and attached to some one else, she had\r\nnot found him the less fluent, omnipresent, persuasive, at Niagara. It\r\nwas diverting to see them seated side by side on Goat Island, he waving\r\nhis hand toward the blue sky, apostrophizing the water, the foliage, the\r\nclouds, and what not, in prose and verse, quite content if he but got a\r\nquiet glance and assenting word now and then, she listening demurely in\r\na state of protestant satisfaction, her fair hair very dazzling in the\r\nsunshine, an unvarying apple-blossom tint in her calm face, her fingers\r\ntatting industriously not to waste the time outright. It was very\r\nagreeable in a way, she told herself, but something must really be done\r\nto get rid of the man. And so, one morning when they chanced to be\r\nalone, and he was being unusually ethereal and beautiful in his remarks,\r\ntelling her that, as Byron had said, she would be \"the morning star of\r\nmemory\" for him, she broke in squarely, \"That is all very nice; very\r\npretty, I am sure. But I do hope you quite understand that I have not\r\nthe least idea of marrying you. There is no use in going on like this,\r\nyou know, and you would have a right to reproach me if I kept silent and\r\nled you to think that I was being won over by your fine speeches. You\r\nsee, you don't really want a star at all. You want a wife; though\r\nmilitary men, as a rule, are better off single. I do thank you heartily\r\nfor liking me for myself, and all that, and I shall always remember the\r\nkind things you have done, and our acquaintance, but you must put me\r\nquite out of your head as a wife. I should not suit you at all. You\r\nwould have to leave the American service, and I should hate feeling I\r\nhad tied you down, and I couldn't contribute a penny toward the\r\nhousehold expenses, and, altogether, we are much better apart. It would\r\nnot answer at all. So, thank you again for the honor you have conferred\r\nupon me, and be--be rather more--like other people, won't you, for the\r\nfuture? Auntie fancies that I am encouraging you, and is getting very\r\nvexed about it. Perhaps you had better go away? Yes, that would be best,\r\nI think.\"\r\n\r\nThus solicited, Captain Kendall went away, taking a mournfully-eloquent\r\nfarewell of Ethel, which she thought final; but in this she was\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nOur party did not linger long after this. Sir Robert met a titled\r\nacquaintance, who inflamed his mind so much about Manitoba that he\r\ndecided to go to Canada at once, taking Miss Noel, Ethel, and Mr.\r\nHeathcote; Mrs. Sykes had taken up on her first arrival with some New\r\nYork people, who asked her to visit them in the central part of the\r\nState,--which disposed of her; Mabel was secretly longing to get back to\r\nher \"American child,\" as Mrs. Sykes called little Jared Ponsonby; and\r\nthey separated, with the understanding that they should meet again\r\nbefore the English guests left the country, and with a warm liking for\r\neach other, the Sykes not being represented in the pleasant covenants of\r\nfriendship formed.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that we have not to bid Ketchum good-by here,\" said Sir\r\nRobert. \"Such a hearty, genial fellow! And how kind he has been to us!\r\nHis hospitality is the true one; not merely so much food and drink and\r\nmoneyed outlay for some social or selfish end, but the entertainment of\r\nfriends because they _are_ friends, with every possible care for their\r\npleasure and comfort, and the most unselfish willingness to do anything\r\nthat can contribute to either. I am afraid he would not find many such\r\nhosts as himself with us. We entertain more than the Americans, but I do\r\nnot think we have as much of the real spirit of hospitality as a nation.\r\nThe relation between host and guest is less personal, there is little\r\nsense of obligation, or rather sacredness, on either side, and the\r\nconvenience, interest, or amusement of the Amphitryon is more apt to be\r\nconsidered, as a general thing, than the pleasure of the guest: at least\r\nthis has been growing more and more the case in the last twenty years,\r\nas our society has broken away from old traditions and levelled all its\r\nbarriers, to the detriment of our social graces, not to speak of our\r\nmorals and manners. As for that charmingly gentle, sweet woman Mrs.\r\nKetchum, it is my opinion that we are not likely to improve on that type\r\nof Englishwoman. A modest, simple, religious creature, a thorough\r\ngentlewoman, and a devoted wife and mother. My cousin Guy Rathbone is\r\nengaged to a specimen of a new variety,--one of the 'emancipated,'\r\nforsooth; a woman who has a betting-book instead of a Bible and plays\r\ncards all day Sunday. He tells me that she is wonderfully clever, and\r\nthat it is all he can do to keep her from running about the kingdom\r\ndelivering lectures on Agnosticism; as if one wanted one's wife to be a\r\ntrapesing, atheistical Punch-and-Judy! And the fellow seemed actually\r\npleased and flattered. He told me that she had 'an astonishing grasp of\r\nsuch subjects' and was 'attracting a great deal of attention.' And I\r\ntold him that if I had a wife who attracted attention in such ways I\r\nwould lock her up until she came to her senses and the public had\r\nforgotten her want of modesty and discretion. This ought to be called\r\nthe Age of Fireworks. The craze for notoriety is penetrating our very\r\nalmshouses, and every toothless old mumbler of ninety wants to get\r\nhimself palmed off as a centenarian in the papers and have a lot of\r\nstuff printed about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see what you mean, Robert,\" said Miss Noel, \"and it certainly cannot\r\nbe wholesome for women to thirst for excitement, and one would think a\r\nlady would shrink from being conspicuous in any way; but things are very\r\nmuch changed, as you say. And I agree with you in your estimate of the\r\nKetchums. She is a sweet young thing, and I heartily like him. Only\r\nthink! his last act was to send a great basket of fine fruits up to my\r\nroom, and quite an armful of railway-novels for the journey. Such\r\nbeautiful thought for our comfort as they have shown!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is rather a good sort in some ways, but a very ignorant man. I\r\nshowed him some of my specimens the other day, and he thought them\r\ngranitic, when they were really Silurian mica schist of some kind,\" put\r\nin Mrs. Sykes, who never could bear unqualified praise. \"Still, on the\r\nwhole, the Americans are less ignorant than might have been expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ consider Mr. Ketchum a most kind, gentlemanly, sociable, clever\r\nman,\" said Miss Noel, with an emphatic nod of her head to each\r\nadjective, \"geology or no geology. And I must say that it is very\r\nungrateful of you to speak of him so sneeringly always.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert only waited to write the usual batch of letters, including a\r\nlast appeal to the editor of the \"Columbia Eagle\" to know whether he\r\nintended to apologize for and publicly retract a certain article, and\r\nasking \"whether it was possible that any considerable or respectable\r\nportion of the Americans could be so arbitrary, illiberal, and exclusive\r\nas to wish to exclude the English from America.\" This done, he left for\r\nCanada with his relatives. With his stay there we have nothing to do. It\r\nconsumed six weeks of exhaustive travel and study of Canadian conditions\r\nand resources, resulting ultimately in the conclusion that Manitoba was\r\nnot the place he was looking for. The ladies, who had been left in\r\nMontreal, were then taken for a short tour through the country, which\r\nthey all enjoyed, after which Sir Robert asked Miss Noel whether she\r\nwould be willing to take Ethel back to Niagara and wait there a\r\nfortnight, or perhaps a little longer, while he and Mr. Heathcote came\r\nback by way of New England and from there went down into Maryland and\r\nVirginia, where, according to \"a member of the Canadian Parliament,\"\r\nlands were to be had for a song.\r\n\r\n\"A fortnight? I could spend a twelve-month there,\" exclaimed she. \"Had\r\nit not been that I was ashamed to insist upon being let off this\r\njourney, I should have stopped there as it was.\"\r\n\r\nTo Niagara the aunt and niece and Parsons went, as agreed, and there\r\nthey found Mr. Bates wandering languidly about the place in chronic\r\ndiscontent with everything for not being something else. He had burned a\r\ngood deal of incense on Ethel's shrine when she was at Kalsing, and now\r\nhailed their advent with some approach to enthusiasm, and attached\r\nhimself to their suite, _vice_ Captain Kendall, retired. He liked to be\r\nseen with them, thought the views from the Canadian side were \"deucedly\r\nfine,\" was cruelly affected by the advertisements in the neighborhood,\r\nwhich he denounced as \"dreadfully American,\" trickled out much feeble\r\ncriticism of and acid comment on his surroundings, gave utterance to\r\nfervent wishes that he was \"abrard,\" and in his own unpleasant way gave\r\nEthel to understand that she might make a fellow-countryman happy by\r\nbecoming Mrs. Samuel Bates if she liked to avail herself of a golden\r\nopportunity. \"I would live in England, you know. I am really far more at\r\nhome there than here,\" said the expatriated suitor. \"I have been taken\r\nfor an Englishman as often as three times in one week, do you know.\r\nCurious, isn't it? I ought to be down in Kent now, visiting Lady\r\nSimpson, a great friend of mine, who has asked me there again and again.\r\nYou would like her if you knew her. She is quite the great lady down\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"A foolish little man, and evidently a great snob, or else rather daft\r\nupon some points,\" Ethel reported to her aunt. \"And such a dull,\r\ndiscontented creature, with all his money!\" Ethel had some trials of her\r\nown just then, and it was no great felicity to listen to Mr. Bates's\r\nendless complaints, nor could she spare much sympathy for the sufferings\r\nof the exile of Tecumseh, with his rose-leaf sensibilities, inanities,\r\nabsurdities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the young gentleman who was indirectly responsible for many a\r\nsad thought of two charming girls that we know of--and who shall say how\r\nmany more?--was enjoying as much happiness as ever fell to any man in\r\nthe capacity of ardent sportsman. He had joined the duke and his party\r\nat St. Louis, and from there they had gone \"well away from anywhere,\" as\r\nhe said in describing his adventures to Mr. Heathcote. He had at last\r\nreached the ideal spot of all his wildest imaginations and most\r\ncherished hopes,--\"the wild part,\"--really the great prairies, about two\r\nhundred miles west of the Mississippi and east of the Rockies. The dream\r\nof his life was being fulfilled. He related, in a style not conspicuous\r\nfor literary merit, but very well suited to the simple annals of the\r\nrich, how, having first procured guides, tents, ambulances,\r\ncamp-equipage, they had pushed on briskly to a military fort, where,\r\nhaving made friends with \"a pleasant, gentlemanly set of fellows,\" the\r\ncommanding officer, \"a friendly old buffer,\" had courteously given them\r\nan escort to protect them from \"those dirty, treacherous brutes, the\r\nIndians.\" Not a joy was wanting in this crowning bliss. The guide was \"a\r\nwonderful chap named Big-Foot Williams, so called by the Indians, good\r\nall around from knocking over a rabbit to tackling a grizzly,\" with an\r\namazing knowledge of woodcraft, \"a nose like a bloodhound, an eye as\r\ncool as a toad's.\" No special mention was made of his ear; but the first\r\ntime he got off his horse and applied it to the earth, listening for\r\nthe tramp of distant hoofs in a hushed silence, one bosom could hardly\r\nhold all the rapture that filled Mr. Ramsay's figurative cup up to the\r\nbrim. And the tales he told of savageness long drawn out were as dew to\r\nthe parched herb, greedily absorbed at every pore. A portrait of \"Black\r\nEagle,\" a noted chief, was given when they got among the Indians,--\"a\r\ngreat hulking slugger of a savage, awfully interesting, long, reaching\r\nstep, magnificent muscles, snake eye, could thrash us all in turn if he\r\nliked. The best of the lot.\"\r\n\r\nEven the noble red man was not insensible to the charms of this\r\ngraceful, handsome young athlete who smiled at them perpetually and\r\nsaid, \"_Amigo! amigo_!\" at short intervals,--a phrase suggested by the\r\nredoubtable Williams and varied occasionally by a prefix of his own,\r\n\"_Muchee amigo_!\" The way in which he tested the elasticity of their\r\nbows, inspected their guns, the game they had killed, the other natural\r\nobjects about them, aroused a certain sympathy, perhaps. At any rate,\r\nthey were soon teaching him their mode of using the most picturesquely\r\nmurderous of all weapons, and Black Eagle offered, through the\r\ninterpreter, to give him a mustang and a fine wolf-skin. The pony was\r\ndeclined, the skin accepted, a _quid pro quo_ being bestowed on the\r\nchief in the shape of one of Mr. Ramsay's breech-loaders, a gift that\r\nmade the snake eyes glitter. But what earthly return can be made for\r\nsome friendly offices? Could a thousand guns be considered as an\r\nadequate payment for the delirious thrill that Mr. Ramsay felt when he\r\nshot an arrow straight through the neck of a big buffalo, and, wheeling,\r\ngalloped madly away, like the hero of one of his favorite stories? Was\r\nnot the duke, who \"knew a thing or two about shooting\" and had hunted\r\nthe noble bison in Lithuania, almost as much delighted as though he had\r\ndone it himself? Is it any wonder that these intoxicating pleasures were\r\nall-sufficient for the time to Mr. Ramsay? Perhaps Thekla would have\r\nbeen forgotten by her Max, and Romeo would never have sighed and died\r\nfor love of Juliet, if those interesting lovers had ceased from wooing\r\nand gone a-hunting of the buffalo instead. Not the most deadly and cruel\r\npangs of the most unfortunate attachment could have taken away all the\r\nzest from such an occupation, provided they had had what the Mexican\r\njournals call the \"_corazon de los sportsmans_.\" Youth, strength,\r\ncourage, skill, exercised in a vagabondage that has all the nomadic\r\ncharm without any of its drawbacks, are apt to sponge the old figures\r\noff the slate of life, leaving a teary smear, perhaps, to show where\r\nthey have been, and room for fresh problems. At night over the camp-fire\r\nMr. Ramsay gave a few pensive thoughts to the girl who regularly put two\r\nhandkerchiefs under her pillow to receive the tears that welled out\r\ncopiously when she was at last alone and unobserved after a day of\r\nvirtuous hypocrisy. Poor child! The pain was very real, and the tears\r\nwere bitter and salty enough, though they were to be dried in due time.\r\nIf he had known of them, perhaps he might have kept awake a little\r\nlonger; but when he wasn't sleepy he was hungry, and when he wasn't\r\nhungry he was tired, and when he wasn't tired he was too actively\r\nemployed to think of anything but the business in hand. Happily, at\r\nfive-and-twenty it is perfectly possible to postpone being miserable\r\nuntil a more convenient season; and, though he would have denied it\r\nemphatically afterward, he certainly thought only occasionally of Bijou\r\nat this period, and of Ethel not at all.\r\n\r\nMiss Noel heard very regularly from Mrs. Sykes all this while; and that\r\nenergetic traveller had not been idle. She had made her new friends\r\n\"take her about tremendously,\" she said. She had seen all the large\r\ntowns in that part of the country, and thought them \"very ugly and\r\nmonotonously commonplace, but prosperous-looking,--like the\r\ninhabitants.\" The scenery she had found \"far too uninteresting to repay\r\nthe bother of sketching it.\" But she had made a few pictures of \"the\r\nviews most cracked up in the White Mountains,\"--where she had been,--\"a\r\nsort of second-hand Switzerland of a place; really nothing after the\r\nHimalayas, but made a great fuss over by the Americans.\" She described\r\nwith withering scorn a drive she took there.\r\n\r\n\"We came suddenly one day upon a party in a kind of Cheap-Jack van,\" she\r\nwrote,--\"gayly-dressed people, tricked off in smart finery, and larking\r\nlike a lot of Ramsgate tradesmen on the public road. One of the impudent\r\ncreatures made a trumpet of his great ugly fist and spelt out the name\r\nof the hotel at which they were stopping, and then put his hand to his\r\near, as if to listen for the response. Expecting _me_ to tell _them_\r\nanything about myself! But I flatter myself that I was a match for them.\r\nI just got out my umbrella and shot it up in their very faces as we\r\npassed, in a way not to be mistaken. And--would you believe it?--the\r\nrude wretches called out, 'The shower is over now! and 'What's the price\r\nof starch?' and roared with laughing.\" A highly-colored description of \"a\r\nvisit to a great Dissenting stronghold, Marbury Park,\" followed: \"I was\r\nimmensely curious to see one of these characteristic national\r\nexhibitions of hysteria, ignorance, superstition, and immorality, called\r\na 'camp-meeting.' to which the Americans of all classes flock annually\r\nby the thousands, so I quite insisted upon being taken to one, though my\r\nfriends would have got out of it if they could. I fancy they were very\r\nashamed of it; and they had need to be. I will not attempt to describe\r\nit in detail here,--you will hear what I have said of it in my\r\ndiary,--but a more glaringly vulgar, intensely American performance you\r\ncan't fancy. I have made a number of sketches of the grounds, the tents\r\nand tent-life, with the people bathing and dressing and all that in the\r\nmost exposed manner; of the pavilion, where the roaring and ranting is\r\ndone; and of the great revivalist who was holding forth when I got\r\nthere, and who had got such a red face and seemed so excited that it is\r\nmy belief he was _regularly screwed_, though my friends denied it, of\r\ncourse. With such a preacher, you can 'realize,' as they say, what the\r\npeople were like. A regular Derby-day crowd having a religious\r\nsaturnalia,--that is what it is. It would not be allowed at home, I am\r\nsure. Disgusting! One can't wonder at the state of society in America\r\nwhen one sees what their religion is. An unpleasant incident occurred to\r\nme while sketching in the pavilion, that shows what I have often pointed\r\nout to you,--the radicalism and odious impertinence of this people. I\r\nwas just putting the finishing-touches to my picture of the Rev. (?)\r\n'Galusha Wickers' (the revivalist: such names as these Americans have!),\r\nwhen I heard a voice behind me saying, 'Lor! Why, that's splendid!\r\nperfectly splendid! Well, I declare, you've got him to a t. Lemmy see.'\r\nAnd, if you please, a hand was thrust over my shoulder and the sketch\r\nseized, without so much as a 'By your leave.' Can you fancy a more\r\nunwarrantable, insufferable liberty? But they are all alike over here. I\r\nturned about, and saw a woman who was examining the reverend revivalist\r\nwith much satisfaction. 'Well, you _have_ got him, to be sure,' she\r\nsaid, returning my angry glance with one of admiration, and quite\r\nunabashed. 'What'll you take for it? I've sat under him for five years;\r\nand for taking texteses from one end of the Bible to the other, and\r\nleading in prayer, and filling the mourners' bench in five minutes, I\r\nwill say he hasn't got his equal in the universe. He's got a towering\r\nintellect, I tell you. I'll give you fifty cents for this, if you'll\r\ncolor it up nice for me and throw in a frame.' Of course I took the\r\npicture away from the brazen creature and told her what I thought of her\r\nconduct. 'Well, you air techy,' she said, and walked off leisurely.\"\r\nBefore closing her letter, Mrs. Sykes remarked of her hostess, \"Quite\r\ngood for nothing physically, and absurdly romantic. She has been abroad\r\na good deal, and bores me dreadfully with her European reminiscences.\r\nShe is always talking in a foolish, rapturous sort of way about 'dear\r\nMelrose,' or 'noble Tintern Abbey,' or 'enchanting Warwick Castle;' and\r\nshe has read simply libraries of books about England, and puts me\r\nthrough a sort of examination about dozens of places and events, as\r\nthough I could carry all England about in my head. I really know less of\r\nit than of most other countries: there is nothing to be got by running\r\nabout it. If one knew every foot of it, everybody would think it a\r\nmatter of course; but to be able to talk of Siam and the Fiji Islands,\r\nCambodia and Alaska, and the like, is really an advantage in society.\r\nOne gets the name of being a great traveller, and all that, and is asked\r\nabout tremendously and taken up to a wonderful extent. I know a man that\r\ndidn't wish to go to the trouble and expense of rambling all over the\r\nworld, and wanted the reputation of having done it, so he went into\r\nlodgings at intervals near the British Museum and got all the books that\r\nwere to be had about a particular country, and, having read them, would\r\ncome back to the West End and give out that he had been there. It\r\nanswered beautifully for a while, and he was by way of being asked to\r\nbecome a Fellow of the Royal Geographical, and was thought quite an\r\nauthority and wonderfully clever; but somehow he got found out, which\r\nmust have been a nuisance and spoiled everything. I can see that these\r\npeople consider it quite an honor to have me visit them, all because of\r\nmy having been around the world, I dare say. And of course I have let\r\nthem see that I know who is who and what is what. They are imploring me\r\nto stay on; but I told them yesterday that it wouldn't suit my book at\r\nall to stay over two weeks longer, when I had seen all there was to see.\r\nThat young Ramsay seems to be enjoying himself out there among those\r\nnasty savages; and, as hunting is about the only thing he is fit for, he\r\nhad best stay out there altogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe unwritten history of Mrs. Sykes's visit to Marbury Park would have\r\nbeen more interesting than the account she gave. She took with her a\r\ncamp-chair, which she placed in any and every spot that suited her or\r\ncommanded the pictorial situations which she wished to make her own\r\npermanently. To the horror and surprise of her friends, she plumped it\r\ndown immediately in front of Mr. Wickers (after marching past an immense\r\ncongregation), and, wholly unembarrassed by her conspicuous position,\r\nsettled herself comfortably, took out her block and pencil, and\r\nproceeded to jot down that worthy's features line upon line, as though\r\nhe had been a newly-imported animal at the \"Zoo\" on exhibition, paying\r\nno attention to the precept upon precept he was trying to impress upon\r\nhis audience.\r\n\r\nShe walked all over the place repeatedly, went poking and prying into\r\nsuch tents as she chanced to find empty, nor considered this an\r\nessential requisite to the conferring of this honor. When less sociably\r\ninclined, she established herself outside, close at hand, and in this\r\nway made those valuable observations and spirited drawings which\r\nsubsequently enriched her diary and delighted a discerning British\r\npublic. But this is anticipating. When she tired of New York, she wrote\r\nto Sir Robert that she wished to give as much time as possible to the\r\nMormons, and would leave at once for Salt Lake City, where she would\r\nbusy herself in laying bare the domestic system as it really existed,\r\nand hold herself in readiness to join the party again when they should\r\narrive there _en route_ to the Yosemite.\r\n\r\nSir Robert, being an heroic creature, felt that he could bear this\r\ntemporary separation with fortitude, and, being about to start for\r\nBoston when he got the news, forthwith threw himself upon the New\r\nEngland States in a frenzied search for all the information to be had\r\nabout them,--their exact geographical position, by whom discovered, when\r\nsettled, climate, productions, population, principal towns and rivers.\r\nHe studied three maps of the region as he rattled along in the\r\nsouth-bound train, and devoted the rest of the time to getting an\r\noutline of its history: so that his nephew found him but an indifferent\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose there are authorized maps and charts, geographical,\r\nhydrographical, and topographical, issued by the government, and to be\r\nseen at the libraries. I must get a look at them at once. These are\r\namateur productions, the work of irresponsible men, contradicting each\r\nother in important particulars as to the relative positions of places,\r\nand inaccurate in many respects, as I find by comparison,\" he said,\r\nemerging from a prolonged study of his authorities. \"You don't seem to\r\ntake much interest in all this. You should be at the pains to inform\r\nyourself upon every possible point in connection with this country, or\r\nany other in which you may find yourself; else why travel at all?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Heathcote, not having his uncle's thirst for information, was\r\nreading a French novel at the time, and did not attempt to defend his\r\nposition, knowing it probably to be indefensible.\r\n\r\nBefore getting to Boston the air turned very chill, and a fine,\r\npenetrating rain set in that for a while disturbed the student of\r\nAmerican history with visions of rheumatism. \"God bless my soul! I shall\r\nbe laid by the heels here for weeks. Damp is the one thing that I can't\r\nstand up against. And I have not left my coat out!\" he exclaimed,\r\ntugging anxiously at his side-whiskers and annoyed to find how dependent\r\nhe had grown on his valet. \"What shall I do? Ah! I have an idea. Damp.\r\nWhat resists it and is practically water-proof? _Newspapers_!\" With this\r\nhe stood up, seized the \"Times\" supplement, made a hole in the middle of\r\nthe central fold, and put it over his head. \"Now I have improvised a\r\nSouth-American _serape_\" he observed, in a tone that betrayed the\r\npleasure it gave him to exercise his ingenuity. He then took two other\r\nsheets and successively wrapped them around his legs, after the fashion\r\nin vogue among gardeners intent upon protecting valuable plants from the\r\nrigors of winter. This done, he smoothed down the _serape_, which showed\r\na volatile tendency to blow up a good deal, and, with a brief comment to\r\nthe effect that \"oilskin or india-rubber could not be better,\" and no\r\nstaring about him to observe the effect of his action on the passengers,\r\nreplaced his hat, sat down, picked up his book again, readjusted his\r\neye-glasses, and went on with the episode he had been reading aloud to\r\nhis nephew, who, mildly bored by King Philip's war, was mildly amused by\r\nthe spectacle the baronet presented, and surprised to see that their\r\nfellow-travellers thought it an excellent joke. A loud \"Haw! haw!\" and\r\nmany convulsive titters testified their appreciation of the absurd\r\ncontrast between Sir Robert's highly-respectable head, his grave,\r\nabsorbed air, and the remarkable way in which he was finished off below\r\nthe ears; but he read on and on, in his round, agreeable voice,\r\nunconscious of the effect he was producing, until the train came to the\r\nfinal stop, when Mr. Porter and a very dignified, rigid style of friend\r\ncame into the car to look for him.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Porter, I am delighted to see you, and I shall be with you in\r\none moment. I shall then have ceased to be a grub and have become a most\r\nbeautiful butterfly, ready to fly away home with you as soon as ever you\r\nlike,\" he called out in greeting, and in a twinkling had torn off his\r\nwrappers, and stood there a revealed acquaintance, carefully collecting\r\nhis \"traps,\" and beaming cheerfully even upon the friend, who had not\r\ncome to a pantomime and showed that he disapproved of harlequins in\r\nprivate life.\r\n\r\nMr. Porter, however, was all cordiality, and very speedily transferred\r\nhis guests to his own house in the vicinity of Boston.\r\n\r\nThe season was not the one for gaining a fair idea of the society of the\r\ncity and neighborhood; but if all the people who were away at the\r\nsea-side and the mountains were half as charming as those left behind\r\nand invited by Mr. Porter, to meet his friends, it is certain that Sir\r\nRobert lost a great deal. On the other hand, it is equally certain that\r\nif they had been at home Sir Robert would most likely be there now, and\r\nthis chronicle of his travels would end here. As it was, he found\r\nsomething novel and agreeable at every step, a fresh interest every hour\r\nof his stay. He began at the beginning, and promptly found out what kind\r\nof soil the city was built on, went on to consider such questions as\r\ndrainage, elevation, water-supply, wharves, quays, bridges, and worked\r\nup to libraries, museums, public and private collections of pictures,\r\nand what not. He ordered three pictures of Boston artists,--two autumnal\r\nscenes, and an interior, a negro cabin, with an hilarious sable group\r\nvariously employed, called \"Christmas in the Quarters.\" Then the\r\nquestions of fisheries, maritime traffic, coast and harbor defences,\r\nlight-houses, the ship-building interests, life-saving associations, and\r\nrailway systems, pressed for investigation, to say nothing of the mills\r\nand manufactories, wages of operatives, trades-unions, trade problems,\r\nand all the pros and cons of free trade _versus_ protective tariff. Over\r\nthese he pondered and pored until all hours every night; and the diary\r\nhad now to be girt about with two stout rubber bands to keep it from\r\nscattering instructive leaflets about promiscuously and prematurely. And\r\nby day there were sites literary, historical, or generally interesting\r\nto be visited, engagements with many friends to keep, endless\r\noccupations apparently.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to see and do that the place was delightful to him,\r\nand he certainly made himself vastly agreeable in return to such of its\r\ninhabitants as came in his way.\r\n\r\n\"I have added to my circle some very valuable acquaintances, whom I\r\nshall hope to retain as friends,\" he wrote to England, \"notably a\r\nmedical man who confirms my germ-propagation theory of the 'vomito,'\r\nwhich is now raging in the Southern part of the States (I had it, you\r\nremember, on the west coast of Africa, and studied it in the\r\nBarbadoes),--an exceptionally clever man, and, like all such men,\r\ninclined to be eccentric. I think I was never more surprised than to\r\ncome upon him the other day in a side-street, where he was positively\r\nhaving his boots polished _in public_ by a ragged gamin who offered to\r\n'shine' me for a 'dime.' He behaved sensibly about it,--betrayed no\r\nembarrassment, though he must have felt excessively annoyed, made no\r\napologies, and only remarked that he had been out in the country, and\r\ndid not wish to be taken for a miller in the town.\r\n\r\n\"I was led to believe before coming here that I should not be able to\r\ntell that Boston was not an English town. It did not so impress me on a\r\nsurface-view, but it was not long before I recognized that the warp and\r\nwoof of the social fabric is that of our looms, though the pattern is a\r\nlittle different,--a good sort of stuff, I think, warranted _to wash_\r\nand wear. The variation, such as it is, tried by what I call my\r\ndifferential nationometer, gives to the place its own peculiar,\r\ndelightful quality.\" The rigid gentleman, who was a great deal at the\r\nPorters', was rather inclined to insist upon the great purity and beauty\r\nof his English, to which he repeatedly invited attention, and, as Mr.\r\nRamsay would have said, \"went in for\" certain philological refinements\r\nwhich Sir Robert had never heard before, and thoroughly disliked. But as\r\nthere are more Scotchmen in London than in Edinburgh, and better oranges\r\ncan be bought for less money in New York than in New Orleans, so it may\r\nbe that if you want to find really superior English you must leave\r\nEngland altogether,--abandon it to its defective but firmly-rooted\r\n_patois_, and seek in more classic shades for the well--spring of Saxon\r\nundefiled. But Sir Robert was not inclined to do this. There were limits\r\nto his liberality and spirit of investigation. When the rigid gentleman\r\ninstanced certain words to which he gave a pronunciation that made them\r\nbear small resemblance to the same words as spoken by any class of\r\npeople laboring under the disadvantage of having been born and bred in\r\nEngland, Sir Robert got impatient, and testily dismissed the subject\r\nwith, \"Oh, come, now! I can stand a good deal, but I can't stand being\r\ntold that we don't know how to speak English in England.\" Something,\r\nhowever, must be pardoned to a foreigner. If Sir Robert would not\r\nconsent to set Emerson a little higher than the angels, as some other\r\nBostonians could have wished, and had never so much as heard of Thoreau\r\nand other American celebrities not wholly insignificant, he had an\r\nimmense admiration for Longfellow, and could spout \"Hiawatha\" or\r\n\"Evangeline\" with the best, associated Hawthorne with something besides\r\nhis own hedges in the month of May, and was eager to be taken out to\r\nBeverly Farms, that he might \"do himself the honor to call upon\" the\r\nwisest, wittiest, least-dreaded, and best-loved of Autocrats. When the\r\nday fixed for his departure came, he was still revelling in what the\r\nHistorical Society of Massachusetts had to show him, and actually\r\nstayed over a day that he might see the finest collection of cacti in\r\nthe country, and at last tore himself away with much difficulty and\r\nlively regrets, carrying with him a collection of Indian curiosities\r\ngiven him by Mr. Porter, whom he considered to have behaved \"most\r\nhandsomely\" in making him such a present. \"I can't rob you outright, my\r\ndear fellow. I feel a cut-purse, almost, when I think of taking all\r\nthese valuable and deeply-interesting objects illustrative of the life\r\nand civilization of the aborigines,\" he said. \"Give me duplicates, if\r\nyou will be so generous, but nothing unique, I insist.\" He finally\r\naccepted one gem in the collection,--a towering structure of feathers\r\nthat formed \"a most delightful head-dress, quite irresistibly\r\nfascinating,\" tried it on before a mirror that gave back faithfully the\r\ncomical reflection, and incidentally delivered a lecture on the\r\nhead-ornaments of many savage and civilized nations of every age, though\r\nnot at all in the style of the famous Mr. Barlow.\r\n\r\nMr. Heathcote at least was not sorry to find that they were, as he said.\r\n\"booked for Baltimore.\" The image of the beautiful Miss Bascombe had not\r\nbeen effaced. Perhaps he had photographed it by some private process on\r\nhis heart with the lover's camera, which takes rather idealized but very\r\ncharming pictures, some of which never fade. At all events, there it\r\nwas, very distinct and very lovely, and always hung on the line in his\r\nmental picture-gallery. It was positively with trepidation that he\r\npresented himself before her very soon after his arrival; and an\r\nundeniable blush \"mantled\" his cheek--if a blush can be said with any\r\npropriety to mantle the male cheek--- when he marched into the\r\ndrawing-room, where she was doing a dainty bit of embroidery, and with\r\nmuch simplicity and directness said, \"You said I might come, you know,\r\nand I have come; and I begged of Ethel to come too, but she could not\r\nleave my aunt,\" before he had so much as shaken hands. Of course no\r\nwell-regulated and well-bred young woman--and Miss Bascombe was\r\nboth--ever permits herself to remember any man until she is engaged to\r\nhim; but she need not forget one that has impressed her agreeably. Miss\r\nBascombe had not forgotten the handsome Englishman she had met at Jenny\r\nDe Witt's, nor the little lecture she had given him on the duties of\r\nbrothers to sisters, and it did not strike her that his inaugural\r\naddress was at all eccentric or mysterious. He had been told what he\r\nought to do; he had tried to do it, as was quite right and proper. He\r\ndeserved some reward. And he got it,--though only as an encouragement to\r\nabstract virtue, of course. The young lady was pleased to be friendly,\r\ngracious, charming. Her mother came in presently, was equally friendly\r\nand gracious, and almost as charming. Her father came home to dinner,\r\nand was friendly too, and hearty, and very hospitable. Her brothers were\r\nfriendliest of all. He knew quite well that he had no claim on them,\r\nthat he had not saved the life of any member of the family or laid them\r\nunder any sort of obligation, individually or collectively, and no\r\nreception could have seemed more special and dangerously cordial, yet no\r\nanxieties oppressed, no fears distracted him. The weight of excessive\r\neligibility suddenly slipped off him, like the albatross from the neck\r\nof the Ancient Mariner, leaving him a thankful and a happy man, and in\r\na week he had established himself firmly at the Bascombes', declined to\r\naccompany his uncle to Virginia, and definitely settled in his own mind\r\nthat he would take the step matrimonial,--the step from the sublime\r\nto--well, not always the ridiculous. With this resolution he naturally\r\nthought that the greatest obstacle to success had been removed; but he\r\nwas soon disillusionized. He had already come to see that American girls\r\nwere very much in the habit of being gracious to everybody, and saying\r\npretty and pleasant things, with no thought of an hereafter; also that\r\nthey did not live with St. George's, Hanover Square, or its American\r\nequivalent, Trinity Church, New York, stamped on the mental retina. Miss\r\nBascombe was \"very nice\" to him, he told himself, but she was quite as\r\nnice to a dozen other men. She was uniformly kind, courteous, agreeable,\r\nto every one who came to the house. Her cordiality to him meant nothing\r\nwhatever. Yes, he was quite free,--free as air; he saw that plainly, and\r\nperversely longed to assume the fetters he had so long and so skilfully\r\navoided. What was the use of having serious intentions when not the\r\nslightest notice was taken of the most compromising behavior? It was\r\ntrue that he was perfectly at liberty to see more of Edith than an\r\nEnglishman ever does of any woman not related to him, and to say and do\r\na thousand things any one of which at home would have necessitated a\r\nproposal or instant flight. But no importance whatever seemed to be\r\nattached to them here, and he was utterly at a loss how to make his\r\nseriousness felt. Yet it was quite clear that if there was to be any\r\nwooing done, he would have to do it,--go every step of the way himself,\r\nwith no assistance from Miss Bascombe. \"How on earth am I to show her\r\nthat I care for her?\" he thought. \"Other men send her dozens of\r\nbouquets, and box after box of expensive sweets, and loads of books, and\r\nmusic without end, and they come to see her continually, and take her\r\nabout everywhere, and are entirely devoted to her. I wonder what\r\nfellows over here do when they are serious? How do they make themselves\r\nunderstood when they go on in this way habitually? It is a most\r\nextraordinary state of affairs! And neither party seems to feel in the\r\nleast compromised by it. There is that fellow Clinch, who fairly lives\r\nat the Bascombes', and when I asked her if she was engaged to him she\r\nsaid, 'Engaged to George Clinch? What an idea! _No_. What put that in\r\nyour head? He is a nice fellow, and I like him immensely, but there's\r\nnothing of that sort between us. What made you think there was? And when\r\nI explained, she said, 'Oh, _that's_ nothing! He is just as nice to lots\r\nof other girls.' And when I suggested to him that he was attached to\r\nher, he said, 'Edith Bascombe? Oh, no! She is a great friend of mine,\r\nand a charming girl, but I have never thought of that, nor has she. I go\r\nthere a good deal, but I have never paid her any marked attention.' No\r\nmarked attention, indeed! Nothing seems to mean anything here: it is\r\nworse than being in England, where everything means something. No, it\r\nisn't, either. I vow that when I am at the Clintons' in Surrey I\r\nscarcely dare offer the girls so much as a muffin, and if I ask the\r\ncarroty one, Beatrice, the simplest question, she blushes and stammers\r\nas if I were proposing out of hand. But what am I to do? I can't sing\r\nand take to serenading Edith on moonlit nights with a guitar and a blue\r\nribbon around my neck. I can't push her into the river that I may pull\r\nher out again. I dare say there is nothing for it but to adopt the\r\nAmerican method,--enter with about fifty others for a sort of\r\nsentimental steeple-chase, elbow or knock every other fellow out of the\r\nway in the running, work awfully hard to please the girl, and get in by\r\nhalf a length, if one wins at all. There is no feeling sure of her until\r\none is coming back from the altar, evidently.\"\r\n\r\nSome of his conversations with Edith were certainly anything but\r\nencouraging. At other times he felt morally sure that she shared that\r\nderangement of the bivalvular organ technically defined as \"a muscular\r\nviscus which is the primary instrument of the blood's motion,\" whose\r\nworst pains are said to be worth more than the greatest pleasures. He\r\nwas very much in earnest, and entirely straightforward, There were no\r\nbalancing indecisions now, but the most downright affirmation of\r\npreference. His little speeches were not veiled in rosy clouds of\r\nmetaphor and poetry and distant allusions, like Captain Kendall's, nor\r\ndid they flow out in an unfailing stream of romantic eloquence, like\r\nthat gifted warrior's. They were so honest and so clumsy, indeed, that\r\nEdith could not help laughing at them merrily sometimes, to his great\r\ndiscomfiture, consisting as they did chiefly of such statements as, \"You\r\nknow that I am most awfully fond of you. I was tremendously hard hit\r\nfrom the first. If you don't believe me, you can ask Ramsay. I told him\r\nall about it. You aren't in the least like any other girl that I have\r\never known, except Mrs. De Witt a little. I suppose you know that I\r\nwould have married her at the dropping of a hat if I could have done so.\r\nBut that is all over now. I care an awful lot for you now, and shall be\r\nquite frightfully cut up if you won't have anything to say to me,--I\r\nshall, really. I have got quite wrapped up in you, upon my word. And I\r\nshall be intensely glad and proud if you will consent to be my wife.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Edith failed to take such speeches as these seriously, poor Mr.\r\nHeathcote was quite beside himself, and, in reply to her bantering\r\naccusations as to his being \"a great flirt\" and not \"really meaning one\r\nword that he said,\" opposed either burly negation or a deeply-vexed\r\nsilence. They looked at so many things differently that they found a\r\npiquant interest in discussing every subject that came up.\r\n\r\n\"There go May Dunbar and Fred Beach,\" she said to him one Sunday as they\r\nwere coming home from church. \"Isn't he handsome? They have been engaged\r\n_three years_. Did you ever hear of such constancy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you call that constancy? Why, if a fellow can't wait three years for\r\na lovely girl like that, he must be a poor stick. Why, my uncle\r\nMontgomery was engaged to his wife seventeen years, while he went out to\r\nIndia and shook the pagoda-tree, after which he came back, paid all his\r\nfather's debts, and they married and went into the house they had picked\r\nout before he sailed,\" said Mr. Heathcote.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious! what a time! I hope the poor things were happy at last.\r\nWere they?\" asked Edith.\r\n\r\n\"H-m--pretty well. He is a rather fiery, tyrannical old party. She\r\ndoesn't get her own way to hurt,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard that Englishwomen give way to the men in everything and\r\nare always, voluntarily or involuntarily, sacrificed to them. It must be\r\nso bad for both,\" said Edith sweetly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you go in for woman's rights and that sort of thing, I suppose,\" he\r\nsaid, in a tone of annoyance.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I don't do anything of the kind,\" replied she, with warmth. \"If\r\nI did, I should be aping the men when I wasn't sneering at them. But I\r\nrespect your sex most when they most deserve to be respected, and I\r\ndon't see anything to admire in a selfish, tyrannical man that is always\r\nimposing his will, opinions, and wishes upon the ladies of his household\r\nand expects to be the first consideration from the cradle to the grave\r\nbecause he happens to be a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is the head of his house. He ought to get his own way, if\r\nanybody does, and, if he is not a coward, he will, too,\" said Mr.\r\nHeathcote rather hotly. \"Would you have a man a molly-coddle, tied to\r\nhis wife's apron-string, and not daring to call his soul his own?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" replied Edith. \"It is the cowards that are the tyrants.\r\n'The bravest are the tenderest, the loving are the daring,' as our\r\nAmerican poet says. And women have souls of their own, except in the\r\nEast. Why shouldn't _they_ be the first consideration and do as they\r\nplease, pray? They are the weaker, the more delicate and daintily bred.\r\nIf there is any pampering and spoiling to be done, they should be the\r\nobjects of it. And as to rights, there is no divine right of way given\r\nto man, that I know of. I don't believe in that sort of thing at all. Of\r\ncourse no reasonable woman wants or expects everybody to kootoo before\r\nher and everything to give way to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no gentleman fails to show a proper respect for his wife's wishes\r\nand comfort, not to mention her happiness,\" said Mr. Heathcote. \"But of\r\ncourse that sort of thing is only to be found in America. Englishmen are\r\nall selfish, and tyrants, and domestic monsters, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say anything of the kind,\" replied Edith quickly, her cheeks\r\npink with excitement. \"I don't know anything about Englishmen or the\r\ndomestic system of England, and I never expect to. But, if what I have\r\nheard is true, it is a system that tends to make men mortally selfish;\r\nand selfish people, whether they are men or women, and whether they know\r\nit or not, are _all_ monsters. But I apologize for my remarks, and, as I\r\nam not interested in the subject _in the least_, we will talk of\r\nsomething else, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nThis very feminine conclusion, delivered loftily and with sudden\r\nreserve, left Mr. Heathcote in anything but an agreeable frame of mind,\r\nand for an hour or two made him doubt the wisdom of international\r\nmarriages; but this mood passed away, and he remained a fixture at the\r\n_maison_ Bascombe, where the very postman came to know him and\r\ngenerously sympathized with the malady from which he was suffering. Nor\r\nwas this the only house in which he was made very welcome. Baltimore is\r\none of many American cities that suffer from the vague but painful\r\naccusation of being \"provincial;\" but, admitting this dreadful charge,\r\nit has social, gastronomic, and other charms of its own that ought to\r\ncompensate for the absence of that doubtful good, cosmopolitanism. Mr.\r\nHeathcote certainly found no fault with it, and did not miss the\r\npopulation, pauperism, or other institutions of Paris, London, or\r\nVienna. On the contrary, he took very kindly to the pretty place, and\r\nheartily liked the people. There was nothing oppressive or ostentatious\r\nin the attentions he received, but just the cordiality, grace, and charm\r\nof an old-established society of most refined traditions, perfect\r\n_savoir-vivre_, and chronic hospitality.\r\n\r\n\"You are making a Baltimorean of me, you are so awfully kind to me,\" he\r\nwould say, pronouncing the _a_ in Bal as he would have done in sal; but\r\nthe truth was that he had become primarily a Bascomite and only very\r\nincidentally a Baltimorean. The city counts hundreds of such converts\r\nevery year. He was so happy and entirely content that he would have\r\nquite forgotten what it was to be bored just at this period but for\r\ncertain individuals,--a boastful, disagreeable Irishman, who fastened\r\nupon him apparently for no other reason than that he might abuse England\r\nat great length and talk of his own valor, accomplishments, and\r\n\"paddygree\" (as he very properly called the record that established his\r\nconnection with Brian Boroo and Irish kings generally), and a lady who\r\nseemed to take the most astounding, unquenchable interest in the English\r\nnobility, as more than one lady had seemed to him to do, to his great\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know a bit about them, I assure you,\" he said to her; \"but I\r\nhave the 'Peerage.' If you would like to see that, I will send it you\r\nwith pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThis only diverted her conversation into a different but equally\r\ndistasteful channel,--the great distinction and antiquity of her own\r\nfamily. It really seemed as though she had a dread of Mr. Heathcote's\r\nleaving the country with some wrong impression on this important subject\r\nand was determined that he should be put in possession of all the\r\ninformation she had or imagined herself to have about it. She talked to\r\nhim about it so much that the poor man was at incredible pains to keep\r\nout of her way.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care a brass copper about her,\" he complained to Edith; \"and\r\nif the family has been producing women like her as long as she says, and\r\nis going on at it, all I can say is that it is a pity they have lasted\r\nthis long, and the sooner they die out the better. What do I care about\r\nher family, pray? I never heard as much about family in all my life, I\r\ngive you my word, as I have done since I came to America. The stories\r\ntold me are something wonderful,--all about the two brothers that left\r\nEngland, and all that, you know. They seem all to have come away in\r\npairs, like the animals in the ark. I said to one fellow that was\r\nbeginning with those two brothers, '_Couldn't you make it three_, don't\r\nyou think?' And you'll not believe me, but I speak quite without\r\nexaggeration, when I say that one woman out in Raising assured me\r\ngravely that she was descended from the houses of York and Lancaster!\"\r\n\r\n\"_She didn't!\"_ exclaimed Edith. \"That is, if she did, she must have\r\nbeen _crazy_; and I won't have you going back to England and giving\r\nfalse impressions of us by repeating such stories. Promise me that you\r\nwill never repeat it there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he replied soothingly. \"It's an extreme case, I\r\ngrant, and I'll say no more about it if it vexes you, but it is a true\r\ntale all the same. Howe was her name, I remember; and I felt like\r\nsaying,--I'll eat my hand if I understand Howe this can possibly\r\nbe,'--that's in the Bab Ballads,--but I didn't.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert had small opportunity of making acquaintance with Baltimore.\r\nHe was very eager to get down into Virginia, and stayed there but two\r\ndays. On the second of these he attended a gentleman's dinner-party, the\r\nannual mile-stone of a military society composed of men who had worn the\r\ngray and marked the well-known tendency of tempus to fugit in this\r\nagreeable fashion. Their ex-enemies of the blue were also there, but not\r\nin the original overwhelming numbers, and the battle was now to one\r\nparty, now to the other, the race to the best _raconteur_, rivers of\r\nchampagne flowed instead of brave blood, and the smoke of cannon was\r\nexchanged for that of Havanas. Sir Robert's face beamed more and more\r\nbrightly as the evening wore on, and reminiscences, anecdotes, stories,\r\njests, songs, were fluently and cleverly poured out in rapid succession\r\nby the hilarious company. The fun was at its height, when he suddenly\r\nleaned forward with his body at an insinuating angle and smilingly\r\naddressed an officer opposite: \"You must really let me say that I have\r\nbeen delighted by all that I have heard here to-night, and appreciate\r\nthe compliment you have paid me in permitting me to join you. And now I\r\nam going to ask a great favor. Could you, would you, give me some idea\r\nof 'the rebel yell,' as it was called? We heard so much about that. I am\r\nmost curious to hear it. It is always spoken of as perfectly terrifying,\r\nalmost unearthly.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman whom he addressed looked down the table and rapped to call\r\nattention to what he had to say: \"Boys, this English gentleman is asking\r\nwhether we can't give him some idea of what the rebel yell is like. What\r\ndo you say? If our Federal friends are afraid, they can get under the\r\ntable, where they will be perfectly safe, and a good deal more\r\ncomfortable than they used to be behind trees or in baggage-wagons,\" he\r\ncalled out.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hearty laugh followed, and, their blood having got bubbles in it by\r\nthis time, a general assenting murmur was heard.\r\n\r\nThe next instant a shriek, sky-rending, blood-curdling, savage beyond\r\ndescription, went up,--a truly terrific yell in peace, and enough to\r\ncreate a panic, one would think, in the Old Guard in time of war.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you. _I am entirely satisfied\"_ said Sir Robert, in a\r\ncomically rueful tone, as soon as he could say anything for the uproar.\r\n\"I never imagined anything like it, never. Where did you get it? Who\r\ninvented it? Is it an adaptation of some war-cry of the North American\r\nIndians? It sounds like what one would fancy their cries might be,\r\ndoesn't it? It has got all the beasts of the forest in it; and I confess\r\nthat I for one, would have fled before it and stayed in the wagons as\r\nlong as there was the slightest danger of hearing it. By Jove! it must\r\nhave been heard in Boston when given in Virginia. It is curious how very\r\nancient the practice of--\"\r\n\r\nBut the company heard no more of curious practices, for their yell had\r\nbeen heard, if not in Boston, in a far more remarkable quarter,--namely,\r\nby the police, who now rushed in, prepared to club, arrest, and carry\r\noff any and all disorderly and dreadful disturbers of the peace.\r\n\r\nIf Sir Robert had been in any danger of being murdered, all experience\r\ngoes to show that no policeman could have been found before the\r\nfollowing morning, and then only in the remotest part of the city. As he\r\nwas merely being wined, dined, and amused, quite a formidable body of\r\nthese devoted but easily-misled guardians of respectability and\r\ninnocence poured into the room, where at first they could see nothing\r\nfor the smoke. Matters were explained, they were invited to \"take\r\nsomething\" before they went, and took it, and, quite placated, filed out\r\ninto the passage again, and from thence into the street.\r\n\r\nSir Robert sat up late that night, or rather began early on the\r\nfollowing day, to copy the stories he had most relished into the diary,\r\nand do what justice he could to \"the rebel yell,\" and, having added an\r\nadmirably discriminating chapter on \"the present political situation in\r\nthe States,\" concluded with, \"How striking is the good sense, the good\r\nfeeling, that both the conquerors and the conquered have shown, on the\r\nwhole! In other countries, how often has a war far less bloody and\r\nprotracted left in its wake evils far greater than the original one, in\r\nguerilla warfare, murders, ceaseless revolt, and smouldering hatred\r\nlasting for centuries on one side, and centuries of tyranny, oppression,\r\nexecutions, confiscations, on the other! A brave and fine race this, not\r\nmade of the stuff that goes to keep up vendettas, shoot landlords, blow\r\nup rulers, assassinate enemies. They can fight as well as any, and they\r\nhave shown that they can forgive better than most,--taken together, true\r\nmanliness. It may be that they are influenced by a consideration which\r\nis said to be always present to an American,--'Will it pay?' and of\r\ncourse so practical a people as this see that anarchy doesn't pay; but I\r\nwould rather attribute their conduct to nobler, more generous motives,\r\nand in doing this seem to myself to be doing them no more than justice.\"\r\n\r\n     F.C. BAYLOR.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONCLUDED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR VILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe picturesqueness of France in our day is confined almost exclusively\r\nto its humble life. The Renaissance and the Revolution swept away in\r\nmost parts of the country moated castle, abbaye, grange, and chateau, to\r\nreplace them with luxurious but conventional piles and ruins humbly\r\nrestored and humbly inhabited. Many a farmhouse with unkempt _cour_\r\nand dishevelled _pelouse_ is the relic of a turreted château,\r\nstables are often desecrated churches, seigneurial _colombiers_\r\nshelter swine, and battlemented portals to fortified walls serve, as\r\ndoes the one of our ville, to house hideously-uniformed _douaniers_\r\nwatching the luggage of arriving travellers.\r\n\r\nOur ville was never an aristocratic one, and to this day very few of our\r\nnames are preceded by the idealizing particle _de_. We have an\r\nancient history, however,--so ancient that all historians place our\r\norigin at _un temps trèsrecule_. We had houses and walls when Rouen\r\nyonder was a marsh, and we saw Havre spring up like a mushroom only two\r\nlittle centuries and a half ago. Besieged and taken, burned and ravaged,\r\nalternately by Protestant and Catholic, no wonder our ville has not even\r\nruins to show that we are older than the fifteen hundreds. Still,\r\nancient though we are, we have always been a ville of humble\r\nfolk,--hardy sailors, brave fishers, and thrifty bourgeois,--and to-day,\r\nas always, our highest families buy and sell and build their philistine\r\nhomes back toward the _côte_, while our humble ones picturesquely\r\nhaunt the _quais_.\r\n\r\nThe town is exquisitely situated at the foot of abrupt _côtes_,\r\njust where the broad and tranquil river shudders with mysterious deep\r\nheavings and meets its dolphin-hued death in the all-devouring sea. Away\r\noff in the shimmering distance is the second seaport city of France. On\r\nstill days,--and our gray or golden Norman days are almost always\r\nstill,--faint muffled sounds of life, the throbbing of factories, the\r\nfarewell boom of cannon from ships setting forth across the Atlantic,\r\neven the musical notes of the Angelus, float across the water to us as\r\ndreamily vague as perhaps our earth-throbs and passion-pulses reach a\r\nworld beyond the clouds. This city is our metropolis, with which we are\r\nconnected by small steamers crossing to and fro with the tide, and where\r\nall our shopping is done, our own ville being too thoroughly limited and\r\n_roturier_ in taste to merit many of our shekels.\r\n\r\nIn fact, such of our shopping as is done in our ville is in the quaint\r\nmarketplace, where black house-walls are beetling and bent, and\r\nSainte-Cathérine's ancient wooden tower stands the whole width of the\r\nPlace away from its Gothic church. Here we bargain and chaffer with\r\ntowering _bonnets blancs_ for peasant pottery and faïence,\r\npaintable half-worn stuffs, and delicious ancestral odds and ends of\r\nbroken peasant households.\r\n\r\nWe have many streets over which wide eaves meet, and within which\r\ntwilight dwells at noonday. Some of the hand-wide streets run straight\r\nup the _côte_, and are a succession of steep stairs climbing beside\r\ncrouching, timber-skeletoned houses perforated by narrow windows opening\r\nupon vistas of shadow. Others seem only to run down from the _côte_\r\nto the sea as steeply as black planks set against a high building. Upon\r\nthe very apex of the _côte_, visible miles away at sea, lives our\r\nrichest citizen. His house smiles serenely modern even if only\r\npseudo-classic contempt on all the quaint duskiness and irregularity\r\nbelow, and is pillared, corniced, entablatured, and friezed, with lines\r\nseverely straight, although the building itself is as round as any\r\nmediæval campanile and surmounted with a Gothic bell-turret, while the\r\nentrance-gate is turreted, machicolated, castellated, like the\r\nfortress-castles of the Goths.\r\n\r\nLower down the _côte_, convent walls raise themselves above\r\nred-tiled and lichen-grown roofs. In one of these convents, behind\r\neyeless grim walls, are hidden cloistered nuns; from others the Sisters\r\ngo freely forth upon errands of both business and mercy. The convent of\r\ncloisters, Couvent des Augustines, is passing rich, and has houses and\r\nlands to let. Once upon a time an _Américaine_ coveted one of these\r\npicturesque houses. She entered the convent and interviewed the\r\nbusiness-manager, a veiled nun behind close bars.\r\n\r\n\"Madame may occupy the house,\" said _ma Soeur_, \"by paying five\r\nhundred francs a year, by observing every fast and feast of the Church,\r\nby attending either matins or vespers every day, and by attending\r\nconfession and partaking of the holy sacrament every month.\"\r\n\r\nMadame is a zealous Catholic, therefore the terms, although peculiar,\r\ndid not seem too severe. She was about to remove into the house, when,\r\nlo! she received word that, it having come to the knowledge of the\r\nconvent that the husband of Madame was a heretic, he could not be\r\nallowed to occupy any tenement of the Communauté.\r\n\r\nAlthough this cloistered sisterhood is vowed to perpetual seclusion,\r\nonce a year even heretics may gaze upon their pale faces. This annual\r\noccasion is the prize-day of the school they teach, when the school-room\r\nis decorated with white cloth and paper roses, the _curés_ of\r\nneighboring parishes and the Maire of our ville, with invited\r\ndistinguished guests, occupy the platform, and the floor below is free\r\nto everybody furnished with invitation-cards.\r\n\r\nI had always longed to enter these prison-like walls and gaze from my\r\ntempestuous distance upon those peaceful lives set apart from earth's\r\nrush and turmoil in a fair and blessed haven of the Lord. I longed to\r\nsee those pure visionaries, pale spouses of Christ, and read upon\r\nillumined faces the unspeakable rapture of mystic union with the Lamb of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Docteur S----, our family physician, is also physician of\r\nthe convent.\r\n\r\n\"You will see nobody,\" he said, remarking my sentimental curiosity\r\nconcerning cloistered nuns,--\"you will see nobody but a lot of\r\nlace-mending and stocking-knitting old maids who failed to get\r\nhusbands.\"\r\n\r\nI had already heard queer stories of our old doctor's forty years of\r\nattendance upon the convent, and I was not so easily discouraged. I was\r\nespecially anxious to see the Mother Superior, having many times heard\r\nthe story of her flight in slippers and dressing-gown from the\r\nbreakfast-table to bury herself forever within the walls that have held\r\nher now these twenty-five years. In all these years her unforgiving\r\nfather has never seen her face, nor she his, although they live within\r\nstone's throw of each other.\r\n\r\n\"Know about him? of course she does,\" answered Victoire to my question.\r\n\"She knows all about him, and more too. Do you suppose there is an item\r\nof news in the whole town that those cloistered nuns do not hear? If you\r\nhad been educated by them, as we were, and pumped dry every day as to\r\nwhat went on in our own and our neighbors' families, you would not ask\r\nthat question.\"\r\n\r\nVictoire and I penetrated into the convent that very same day. We\r\nfollowed a crowd of women, _paysannes_ and _citoyennes_, into\r\na sunny court paved with large stones and arched by the noontide sky,\r\nbut unsoftened by tree or flower, and surrounded by the open windows of\r\ndormitories. Over the threshold we had just crossed the nuns pass but\r\nonce after their vows,--pass outward, feet foremost, deaf and unseeing,\r\nto a closer, darker home than even their cloistered one. Some of them\r\nhave seen nothing beyond their convent walls for forty years, while one\r\nhas here worn away sixty years.\r\n\r\n_Sixty years_ without one single glimpse of sweet dawn or fair\r\nsunset, without one single vision of the sea in winter majesty of storm\r\nor summer glory! _Sixty years_ without sound of lisping music\r\nrunning through tall grass, without one single whisper of the æolian\r\npines, or glimpse of blooming orchards against pure skies! _Sixty\r\nyears_!\r\n\r\nBeside me in the school-room sat a buxom peasant-woman, who, as a little\r\ngirl crowned with a gaudy tinsel wreath descended from the platform,\r\nconfidentially informed me, \"_C'est ma fille._ She has taken the\r\nprize for good conduct, and there isn't a worse _coquine_ in our\r\nwhole commune.\"\r\n\r\nI saw the pale visionaries, a circle of black-robed figures, with\r\ndead-white bands, like coffin-cerements, across their brows. I saw them\r\nalmost unanimously fat, with pendulous jowls and black and broken teeth,\r\nas remote from any expression of mystic fervors and spiritual espousals\r\nas could be well imagined, _\"Vieilles commères_!\" grunted my\r\n_paysanne,_ who was evidently neither amiable nor saintly.\r\n\r\nMother Mary-of-the-Angels, once Elise Gautier, was short, fat, and\r\nbustling, with large round-eyed spectacles upon her nose, and the pasty\r\ncomplexion and premature flaccid wrinkles that come with long seclusion\r\nfrom sunshine and exercise. She marched about like one who had chosen\r\nMartha's rather than Mary's manner of serving her Lord, and we saw her\r\nchat a full half-hour with the wife of the Maire, bowing, smiling,\r\ngesticulating meantime with all the florid grace of a French woman of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"The Maire's wife was her former intimate friend,\" whispered Victoire.\r\n\"See how much younger and healthier she looks than the Mother Superior,\r\nand how much happier. _On dit_ that it was chagrin at the marriage\r\nof this friend that caused Élise Gautier to desert her widowed father\r\nand dependent little brothers and sisters to bury herself in a convent.\"\r\n\r\nA more interesting story than Élise Gautier's is told in our ville. Some\r\nyears ago a nun left the Couvent des Augustines in open day, passing out\r\nfrom the central door in her nun's garb, and meeting there a\r\nforeign-looking man accompanied by a posse of gendarmes. The couple,\r\nfollowed by a half-hooting, half-cheering mob, drove directly to the\r\nhôtel-de-ville, where they were united in marriage. Then they went away\r\nfrom our ville, where both were born, to the husband's home in Spain.\r\nWhen those convent doors had closed upon her, a quarter of a century\r\nbefore, and the lovers believed themselves eternally separated, she was\r\na lovely girl of twenty, he a bright youth of twenty-five. She passed\r\naway from his despairing sight, fair and fresh as a spring flower, with\r\nbeautiful golden hair and violet eyes; she came out from that fatal\r\nportal a woman of forty-five, stout, spectacled, with faded, thin hair\r\nbeneath her nun's cowl, to meet a portly gray-haired man of fifty, in\r\nwhom not even love's eye could detect the faintest vestige of the\r\nslender bright-eyed lover of her youth.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Laure had been forced to unwilling vows to keep her from\r\nthis beggarly lover, and, when he fled to Spain, both became dead to our\r\nville for long years. Twenty-two years after Laure became Soeur Angelica\r\nit was known in the convent that the machinery of the civil law, which\r\nhad only lately forbidden eternal religious vows, had been set in motion\r\nto secure her release; but it remained a mystery who the spring of the\r\nmovement was, her parents having long been dead. Soeur Angelica herself\r\nseemed almost more terrified than otherwise at the knowledge, for every\r\nconventual influence was brought to bear upon her morbid conscience to\r\nassure her that eternal damnation follows broken vows. It seems,\r\nhowever, that amid all her spiritual stress she never confessed, even to\r\nher spiritual director, what desecration had come upon that dovecote by\r\nher constant correspondence with the lover of her youth, now a wealthy\r\nwine-merchant in Spain. When she left the convent, some of these\r\nlove-letters were left behind; and to this day those scandalized doves,\r\nto whom Soeur Angelica is forever a lost soul, wonder futilely how those\r\nemissaries of Satan penetrated their holy walls.\r\n\r\n\"How _did_ they, do you suppose?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nVictoire and Clarice smiled curiously, while Émile, with an expression\r\nsavoring of paganism and pig-tails, squinted obliquely toward our\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\"_Nous n'en savons rien_\" they answered me.\r\n\r\nThe social amusements of our ville are few, as must naturally be the\r\ncase in a provincial town ruled by the Draconian law that a _jeune\r\nfille à marier_ must be no more than an animated puppet, while\r\n_jeunes gens_ must have their coarse fling before they are fit for\r\nrefined society. Occasionally an ambulant theatrical troupe gives an\r\nentertainment in our little theatre. Once a year Talbot comes, during\r\nvacation at the Francais, and gives us \"L'Avare\" or \"Le Roi s'amuse;\"\r\nbut such are small events, to our provincial taste, compared with the\r\nvaulting and grimacing of the more frequent English and American circus\r\ntroupes in our Place Thiers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chief distraction of our young people is going to early\r\nmass, whither our young ladies go accompanied by _bonnes_, Maman\r\nhaving not yet emerged from the French mamma's chrysalis condition of\r\nmorning crimping-pins, petticoat and short gown, and list slippers. The\r\n_bonnes_ who thus serve as chaperons are often as young as or even\r\nyounger than the demoiselles whose virginal modesty they are supposed to\r\nprotect. That they are anything more than a mere form of guardian, a\r\nfigment of the social fiction that a young French girl never leaves her\r\nmother's side till she goes to her husband's, it is unnecessary to\r\nobserve. Human nature, especially French human nature, is human nature\r\nall the world over, and Romeo will woo and Juliet be won during early\r\nmass or twilight vespers as well as from a balcony, in spite of all the\r\nMontagues and Capulets. Girl-chaperons are oftener in sympathy with\r\nardent daughters than with worldly mothers, while even the oldest and\r\nmost sedate of French _bonnes_ are malleable to other influences\r\nthan those of their legitimate employers. It was across our river,\r\nyonder from whence the sound of the Angelus comes across the summer\r\nwater like the music of dreams, that Balzac's Modest Mignon carried on\r\nher intrigues of hifalutin gush, by means of a facile _bonne_, with\r\na man whom she had never seen, and who deceived her by personating the\r\npoet she wished him to be. Modest Mignons are not rare in our ville, and\r\nthe Gothic vaults of Saint-Léonard and the pillared aisles of\r\nSainte-Cathérine witness almost as many little intrigues, as many\r\nheart-beats and blushes, as does \"evenin' meetin'\" in our own bucolic\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nDésirée, our _femme-de-chambre,_ before she came to us, lived in a\r\nwealthy _roturier_ family.\r\n\r\n\"It was a good place, and I was sorry to lose it when Mademoiselle\r\nEugénie was married,\" said she. \"The little gifts the _jeunes gens_\r\nslipped into my panier as I came with mademoiselle from mass almost\r\nequalled my wages. Mademoiselle had a good _dot_ as well as beauty,\r\nand _ces jeunes gens_ expected to lose nothing by what they gave\r\nme. Mademoiselle herself often said, 'Désirée, walk a few steps behind\r\nme, and, while I keep my eyes upon the pavement, tell me all the young\r\nmen who turn to look after me. If you hear any of them say, \"_Comme\r\nelle est jolie!_\" (How pretty she is!) you shall have my _batiste\r\nmouchoirs_.'\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoons all the bourgeois world of our ville disports\r\nitself upon the jetty. Not only then do all the mothers of the town with\r\ndaughters \"to marry\" bring those daughters to the weekly matrimonial\r\nmart, but many of the mothers and chaperons of the near country round\r\nabout come in from rural _propriété_ and rustic _chalet_ to\r\nexhibit their candidates. The method of procedure is eminently French,\r\nof course, and eminently naïve, as even the intrigues and machinations\r\nof Balzac's _bourgeoisie_, although intended as marvels of finesse,\r\nseem so often naïveté itself to our blunter and less-plotting minds. The\r\nmothers and daughters, or chaperons and charges, walk slowly arm in arm\r\nup and down one side the jetty, facing the counter-current of young men\r\nand men not young who have not lost interest in feminine attractions.\r\nBack and forth, back and forth, for hours, move the two separate\r\nstreams, never for one instant commingling, each discussing the other's\r\nprospects, characters, appearance, and, above all, _dots_ and\r\n_rentes_, till twilight falls and all the world goes home to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a retired man of business came to our ville,\r\naccompanied by his son. He was one of the class known in England as\r\n\"Commys,\" and so obnoxious in France as _commis-voyageurs._ He\r\nstopped at the Cheval Blanc, and in conversation with mine host inquired\r\nif it might chance that some café-keeper in the town desired to sell his\r\ncafé and marry his daughter. Monsieur Brissom mentioned to him our\r\ncafé-keepers blessed with marriageable daughters, and \"Commy\" made the\r\nrounds among them, announcing that he had a son whom he wished to marry\r\nto some charming demoiselle _dot_ed with a café. One of the\r\ncafé-keepers had \"_précisément votre affaire_.\" It was arranged\r\nthat Mademoiselle Clothilde should be promenaded by her mother the next\r\nSunday on the jetty, where the young man should join the\r\ncounter-current, and thus each take observations of the other.\r\n\r\nAs said, so done. Monsieur Henri and Mademoiselle Clothilde declared\r\nthemselves enchanted with each other.\r\n\r\n\"_Très-bien_,\" said the reflective parents. \"Now fall in love as\r\nfast as ever you please.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur and mademoiselle not only \"fell,\" but plunged.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks afterward, however, the papas fell out. Cafétier exacted more\r\nthan Commis could promise, and Commis declared Mademoiselle Clothilde\r\n_pas grand' chose_: her eyebrows were too white, and her toes\r\nturned in.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was declared \"off,\" and the young people were ordered to\r\nfall out of love the quickest possible.\r\n\r\n\"Too late!\" they cried.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen each other but four times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite enough,\" declared the lovers.\r\n\r\n\"You shall not marry,\" shouted the parents.\r\n\r\n\"We _will_!\" screamed their offspring.\r\n\r\nNevertheless they could not, for the French law gives almost absolute\r\npower to parents. Mademoiselle would have no _dot_ unless her\r\nfather chose to give her one, and no French marriage is legal without\r\npaternal consent or the almost disgraceful expedient of _sommations\r\nrespectueuses_. Mademoiselle threatened to enter a convent. Cafétier\r\nassured her that no convent opens cordial doors to _dot_less girls.\r\n\r\nJuliet was ready to defy all the Capulets when she had seen Romeo but\r\nonce; Corinne was ready to fling all her laurels at Oswald's feet at\r\ntheir second interview; Rosamond Vincy planned her house-furnishing\r\nduring her second meeting with Lydgate; even Dorothea Brooke felt a\r\n\"trembling hope\" the very next day after her first sight of Mr.\r\nCasaubon. How, then, could one expect poor Clothilde to yield up her\r\nundersized, thin-moustached, and very unheroic-looking Henri, having\r\nseen him _four_ times?\r\n\r\nThere was one way out of her troubles,--that to which Alphonse Daudet's\r\nand André Theuriet's people gravitate as needles to their pole. She\r\nwalked one dark midnight upon the jetty alone. Nobody saw the end; but\r\nthe next Sunday, three weeks to a day from the one when the two had\r\ncountermarched in matrimonial procession, Mademoiselle Clothilde was\r\nlaid in her grave.\r\n\r\nThe whole French social system revolves around the _dot_.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you speak to my father so!\" I once heard a daughter reproach\r\nher mother. \"How dare you, who brought him no _dot_!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity Madame Marais has no more influence in her family,\" I\r\nheard remarked in a social company. \"It is a pity, for she is a good\r\nwoman, and her husband and sons are all going to the bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a pity,\" answered another; \"but, then, what else can she\r\nexpect? She brought no _dot_ into the family.\"\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a young man made a friendly call upon a family in our\r\nville, he a distant relative of the family. He sat in the _salon_\r\nwith mother and daughter, when suddenly the mother was called away a\r\nmoment. When she returned, not more than two minutes later,--horror!\r\n_she could not enter the room!_ In closing the door she had somehow\r\ndisarranged the handles; screws had dropped out and could not be found;\r\nthe knob would not turn. What a situation! A young girl shut up in a\r\nlocked room with a young man! What a scandal if the story got out in the\r\ntown! and what could the poor, distracted mamma do to release her\r\ndaughter from that damning situation without the knowledge of the\r\nservants? She dared not even summon a locksmith, for locksmith tongues\r\nare free; and who would not shoot out the lip at poor Jeanne, hearing\r\nthe miserable story at breakfast-tables to-morrow?\r\n\r\n\"You must marry Jeanne, _mon cousin_,\" cried mamma through the\r\nkeyhole.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, _ma cousine_. You know I am _fiancé_,\" laughed\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he did!\r\n\r\nFor when papa heard that Jeanne had remained two whole hours shut up\r\nwith Cousin Pierre in a brilliantly-lighted _salon_, with a frantic\r\nmother at the keyhole and all the servants grinning upon their knees\r\nsearching for the missing screws, he added twenty thousand francs to her\r\n_dot_ on the spot, and Pierre wrote to his other _fiancée_ that he had\r\n\"changed his intentions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mamma's _tapage_ was too funny,\" laughed Madame Pierre, telling me\r\nthis story herself. \"Pierre and I laughed well on our side of the door,\r\nalthough we were careful not to let maman hear us. For we had often been\r\nalone together before when _nobody knew it_.\"\r\n\r\nWhich makes all the difference in the world in our ville, as well as\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nPierre's funny experience did not end with his betrothal. In relating\r\nthe adventure which follows, I wish it distinctly to be understood that\r\nI do it in all respect, admiration, and reverence for the Church which\r\nis the mother of all Churches calling themselves Christian. The Holy\r\nRoman Catholic Church is no less holy that her servants are so often\r\nbase and vile and that her livery is so often stolen to serve evil in.\r\nWhat wickedness and hypocrisy have we not in our own Protestant clergy,\r\nand without even the tremendous excuse for it which the conditions of\r\nEuropean society give for the occasional levity of its priesthood! In\r\nFrance the Church is a recognized profession, to which parents destine\r\nand for which they educate their sons without waiting for them to\r\nexhibit any special bias toward a religious life. In spite of\r\nthemselves, many young men are even forced into the priesthood, not only\r\nby strong family influence, but through having been educated so as to be\r\nabsolutely unfitted for any other walk of life. With us the priesthood\r\nis a matter of deliberate and perfectly voluntary choice, and he who\r\nwears it as a cloak is ten thousand times the hypocrite his Catholic\r\nbrother is.\r\n\r\nIt happened that our _curé_ of Saint-Étienne was a jolly good\r\nfellow, somewhat given to wine-bibbing, and much given to Rabelaisian\r\nstories. He was also hail-fellow-well-met with Pierre, and Pierre, like\r\nmost of the young men of France, prided himself upon his entire freedom\r\nfrom the \"superstitious.\" Père Duhaut lived by teaching and preaching.\r\n\r\nIn France the church sacrament of marriage cannot be performed unless\r\nboth the contracting parties furnish certificates of having made\r\nconfession within three weeks. To secure his certificate it would be\r\nnecessary for Pierre to confess to the _curé_ of Saint-Étienne,\r\nPère Duhaut.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ confess to Duhaut!\" he laughed in our house. \"I'll\r\nbe--what's-his-named first. Old Duhaut might as well confess to me. I\r\nshall simply give him six francs and get my certificate without any more\r\nado, just as the other fellows get theirs.\"\r\n\r\nThat very afternoon Père Duhaut took tea with us, and Émile was mean\r\nenough to betray Pierre's intentions.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see,\" said our _curé_.\r\n\r\nThe next day Pierre passed our windows. He bowed gayly, and called up\r\nthat he was going for his six francs' worth of ante-nuptial absolution.\r\nAn hour later he passed again, but he did not look up. In the evening\r\nPère Duhaut came, bursting with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Pierre how he got his certificate,\" he guffawed. Then he told us\r\nthe story. Pierre, it seems, had offered the six francs, which offer the\r\nconfessor had rejected with scorn.\r\n\r\n\"In to the confessional,\" he cried, \"and make your confession like a\r\npenitent!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make it fifteen,\" grinned Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Not for a thousand. In! _in_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, Duhaut, this is all humbug. You know I'm not penitent, and\r\nI'll be---- if I'll confess to you.\"\r\n\r\nWithout more words, the burly priest seized the recalcitrant and grabbed\r\nhim by the neck, trying to force him into the confession-box. Pierre\r\nresisted, and, as the _curé_ told us bursting with laughter, the\r\ntwo wrestled and waltzed half around the church. Finally Pierre was\r\nbrought to his knees.\r\n\r\n\"_Eh bien, allez_! What am I to confess?\" he grumbled.\r\n\r\n\"Every sin you have committed since your last confession.\"\r\n\r\nHow malicious was Père Duhaut in this! for he knew Pierre had not kept\r\nthe observances of the Church since he left home at seventeen, and had\r\nnot been an anchorite either.\r\n\r\n\"I'll make it an even hundred,\" begged the now exasperated yet humbled\r\nPierre. \"Come, now, do be reasonable; that's a jolly old boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confess! confess!\" roared the confessor, dealing the kneeling\r\nimpenitent a sounding cuff on the ear.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Pierre how he got his certificate,\" roared Père Duhaut.\r\n\"_Demandez-lui! Demandez-lui!_\"\r\n\r\nBut we never did.\r\n\r\nUntil his grave received him, only a few weeks ago, a marked character\r\nof our ville was a stooping old man, of a ghastly paleness, noted\r\nthrough all the region for avarice and for speaking every one of his\r\nmany languages each with worse accent than the other. His Spanish\r\nsounded like German, his German had the strongest possible American\r\naccent, his English was vividly Teutonic, and after forty years of\r\nmarriage his Norman wife never ceased to mock at his atrociously-mouthed\r\nFrench. He was wine-merchant and banker combined, and, though his social\r\nposition was among the best in our bourgeoise ville, all the world\r\nsmiled with the knowledge that the rich old _banquier_, whose nose\r\nhad a strong Hebraic curve, delivered his own merchandise at night from\r\nunder his long coat, in order to escape the tax on every bottle of wine\r\ntransported from one domicile to another.\r\n\r\nThe stately gate-post of \"Père S----'s\" pretentious and philistine\r\nmansion is decorated with the coats-of-arms of several nations.\r\nEngland's is there, Germany's, Spain's, Portugal's, as well as our own\r\nEagle; while upon days when our own exiled hearts beat most proudly--4th\r\nof July and 22d of February--our star-spangled banner floats from his\r\nroof-top as well as from our own, the only two, of course, in our ville.\r\nOur ville, so important to us, has scarcely an existence for our home\r\ngovernment, and administrative changes there float over us like clouds\r\nof heaven, without touching us in their changefulness. Thus Père S----,\r\nthough so courteous and cordial to Americans, has been long years\r\nforgotten at Washington, whence every living servitor of the\r\nadministration that appointed him our consul here has long since passed\r\naway forever. He was born in Pennsylvania, of German parents, nearly\r\neighty years ago. He received his appointment in 1837, and held it\r\nthrough fourteen administrations since Van Buren, without ever returning\r\nto America, till he faded away one little month ago and was buried in\r\nthe parish cemetery of Saint-Léonard by a Lutheran pastor brought over\r\nfor the occasion from Havre. No church-bells tolled for his death, and\r\nthe street-children did not go on their way singing, as they always do,\r\nto the sound of funeral bells.\r\n\r\n\"_Viens, corps, ta fosse t'attend!_\" for Pere S---- was a heretic,\r\nand could not have slept in consecrated ground had he died before the\r\nRépublique Française removed religious restrictions from all\r\nburial-places. All the consular corps in all the region round about\r\nfollowed the old man to his long home, all our public buildings hung\r\ntheir flags half-mast high, all our little world told queer stories of\r\nthe dead old man. But our own hearts grew tender with thoughts of this\r\nlife finished at fourscore years with its longing of almost half a\r\ncentury unfulfilled. \"Philip Nolan\" we often called the old man, who\r\nsometimes said to us, with yearning, pathetic voice,--\r\n\r\n\"I am an American; I am here only till I make my fortune. When I am rich\r\nenough I shall go _Home_. I shall die and be buried at Home,--when\r\nI am rich enough.\"\r\n\r\nTemperament is Fate. Père S----'s temperament of Harpagon fated him to\r\ndie as he had lived,--a man without a country.\r\n\r\n     MARGARET BERTHA WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMITIVE COUPLE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nPARADISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island in Magog Lake was like a world by itself. Though there were\r\nbut fifteen or twenty acres of land in it, that land was so diversified\r\nby dense woods, rocks, verdant open spots, and smooth shore-rims that it\r\nseemed many places in one.\r\n\r\nAdam's tent was set in the arena of an amphitheatre of hills, upon\r\nclose, smooth sward sloping down to the lake-margin of milk-white sand.\r\nBeyond the lake stood up a picture as heavenly to man's vision as the\r\nNew Jerusalem appearing in the clouds.\r\n\r\nThis was a mountain bounded at the base by two spurs of the lake, and\r\nclothed by a plumage of woods, except upon spaces near the centre of its\r\nslope. Here green fields disclosed themselves and two farm-houses were\r\nnested, basking in the light of a sky which deepened and deepened\r\nthrough infinite blues.\r\n\r\nThough it was high noon, dew yet remained upon the abundance of ferns\r\nand rock-mosses on those heights around the camp. The tent stood open at\r\nboth ends, framing a triangular bit of lake-water and shore. Within it\r\nwere a table piled with books, an oval mirror hung over a toilet-stand,\r\ngarments suspended along a line, a small square rug overlying the sward,\r\nand camp-chairs.\r\n\r\nThe two cots had been stripped of their blankets--which were out sunning\r\nupon a pole--and set in the thickest shade, and upon one of these cots\r\nEva was stretched out, having a pillow under her head. Her dress was of\r\na green woollen stuff, and barely reached the instep of her low shoes. A\r\nmighty bunch of trailing ferns, starred with furry azure flowers and\r\nox-eyed daisies, was fastened from her neck to her girdle. She had drawn\r\nher broad sun-hat partly over the bewitching mystery of her eyes and\r\nforehead, to keep the sky-glow at bay, but left space enough through\r\nwhich to search the whole visible world, and her face was smiling with\r\npure joy. To be alive beside Lake Magog was sufficient; and she was both\r\nalive and beloved.\r\n\r\nShe thought within herself how indescribable all this beauty was. A\r\npleasant wind smelling of world-old fern-loam fanned her. There were\r\nneither mosquitoes nor flies to sting, and, had there been, Adam was\r\nprovided with a bottle of pennyroyal oil, wherewith he would anoint her\r\nface and hands, kissing any lump planted there before he came to the\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\nEva felt sure she never wanted to go back to civilization again. Days\r\nand days of shining weather, fog-or dew-drenched in the morning,\r\nwine-colored or opaline in the evening; cool, starry nights, so cool, so\r\ndense with woods-shade that they drove her to hide her head in the\r\nblankets under Adam's arm; glowing noons, when the world swam in\r\necstasy; long pulls at the oars from point to point of this magic lake,\r\nshe holding the trolling-line at the stern of the boat, her husband\r\nsometimes resting and leaning forward to get her smile at nearer range\r\nupon his face; plunges into the warm lake-water in the afternoon when\r\ntime stood still in a trance of satisfaction:--what a honeymoon she was\r\nhaving! Why should it ever end? There were responsible folks enough to\r\ncarry the world's work forward. Two people might be allowed to spend\r\ntheir lives in paradise, if a change of seasons could only be prevented.\r\nAnyhow, Eva was soaking up present joy. She half closed her eyes, and\r\nwhispered fragmentary words, feeling that her heart was a censer of\r\nincense, swinging off clouds of thanksgiving at every beat.\r\n\r\nAdam came from the spring with a dripping pail. A fret-work of cool\r\ndrops stood all over the tin surface, even when he set the pail beside\r\nhis heated stove. That water had been filtered through moss and pebbles\r\nand chilled by overlaced boughs until its nature was glacial.\r\n\r\nThe cooking-stove stood quite apart from the tent, under a tree. Blue\r\nwoodsmoke escaped from its pipe and straight-way disappeared. A covered\r\npot was already steaming, and Adam filled and put the kettle to boil.\r\nNot far from the stove was a stationary table, made of boards fastened\r\nupon posts. The potato-cellar and the cold-chest were boxes sunk in the\r\nground. Some dippers, griddles, and pans hung upon nails driven in the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nAdam spread the table with a red cloth, brought chairs from the tent,\r\nand came and leaned over Eva's cot. He was a sandy-haired, blue-eyed,\r\nhardy-looking Scotchman, gentlemanly in his carriage, and bearing upon\r\nhis visible character the stamp of Edinbro' colleges and of Calvinistic\r\nsincerity. He wore the Highland cap or bonnet, a belted blouse,\r\nknickerbockers, long gray stockings, and heavy-soled shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mrs. Macgregor,\" said Adam, giving the name a joyful burr in his\r\nthroat, \"my sweethairt. I must have a look of your eyes before you taste\r\na bit of my baked muskalunge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Macgregor. And will I get up and set the table and help put\r\non dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my darling. It's all ready,--or all but a bit of fixing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so happy,\" said Eva, \"so lazy and happy, it doesn't seem fair to\r\nthe rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is at this time no rest of the world,\" responded Adam. \"Nothing\r\nhas been created but an island and one man and woman. Do you belaive\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would if I didn't see those farm-houses, and the boats occasionally\r\ncoming and going on the lake; yes, and if you didn't have to row across\r\nthere for butter and milk, and to Magog village for other supplies.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a mere illusion. We live here on ambrosial distillations from\r\nthe rocks and muskalunge from the lake. I never came to Canada from old\r\nGlazka town, and never saw Loch Achray, or Loch Lomond, or any body of\r\nwater save this, since I was created in God's image without any\r\nknowledge of the catechism. And let me see a mon set foot on this\r\nstrond!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you inhospitable creature!\"\r\n\r\n\"I but said let me see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I know what you meant. You meant you didn't want anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"My wants are all satisfied, thank God,\" said Adam, lifting his cap. \"I\r\nhave you, and the breath o' life, and the camp-outfit.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the mountains, and the lake, and the rocks, and the woods,\" added\r\nEva. \"I never could have believed there were such sublime things in the\r\nworld if I hadn't seen them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither could I,\" owned the Scotchman. \"Especially such a sublime thing\r\nas me wife.\"\r\n\r\nEva struck at him, restraining her palm from bringing more than a pat\r\nupon his cheek.\r\n\r\n\"How your little hand makes me tremble!\" said Adam, drawing his breath\r\nfrom chest-depths. \"Will I ever grow to glimpse at you without having\r\nthe blood spurt quick from me hairt, or to touch you without this\r\nfaintness o' joy? And don't mock me wi' your eyes, bonnie wee one, for\r\nit's bonnie wee one you'll be to me when you're a fat auld woman the\r\nsize of yonder mountain. And _that_ changes the laughter in your eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't suppose you ever _could_ call me a fat old woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be an auld man then meself, me fiery locks powthered with ashes,\r\nand my auld knees knocking one at the ither,\" laughed Adam.\r\n\r\n    \"But hand in hand we'll go,\"\r\nsang Eva,\r\n    \"And sleep thegither at the foot,\r\n    Joh--n Ander--son, my jo--o.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't!\" said Adam, with a sudden grasp on her wrist. \"My God! one\r\nmust go first; and I could naither leave you nor close these eyes of\r\nyours.\" He put his other hand across his eyelids, his lower features\r\nwincing. \"Sweetheart,\" said Adam, removing it, and taking her head\r\nbetween his palms, \"for what we have already received the Lord make us\r\nduly thankful. And shut up about the rest. And there's grace said for\r\ndinner: excepting I didn't uncover me head. Excuse me bonnet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take off your ridiculous bonnet,\" said Eva, emerging from the eclipse\r\nof a long kiss, \"and drag me out of my web. If I am to be your helpmeet,\r\nmake me help.\"\r\n\r\n\"You naidn't lift a finger, my darling. I don't afford and won't have a\r\nsairvant in the camp, so I should sairve you myself.\"\r\n\r\nPassing over this argument, Eva crept up on the stretcher and had him\r\nlift her to the ground. Her shape was very slender and elegant, and when\r\nthe two passed each an arm across the other's back to walk together\r\nschool-girl fashion, Adam's grasp sloped far downward. She did not quite\r\nreach his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey made coffee, and served up their dinner in various pieces of\r\npottery. The baked muskalunge was portioned upon two plates and\r\nsurrounded with stewed potato. Potatoes with scorched jackets, enclosing\r\ntheir own utmost fragrance, also came out of the ashes. Adam poured\r\ncoffee for Eva into a fragile china cup, and coffee for himself into a\r\ntin pint-measure. The sugar was in a glass fruit-jar, and the cream came\r\ndirectly off a pan in the cold-box. They had pressed beef in slices,\r\nchow-chow through the neck of the bottle, apricot jam in a little white\r\npot, baker's rolls, and a cracked platter heaped with wild strawberries.\r\nAround the second point of Magog Island, down one whole stony hill-side,\r\nthose strawberries grew too thick for stepping. The hugest, most deadly\r\nsweet of cultivated berries could not match them. You ate in them the\r\nlight of the sky and the ancient life of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"I never was so hungry at home,\" said Eva, accepting a finely-done bit\r\nof fish with which her lord fed her as a nestling. \"Perhaps things taste\r\nbetter eaten out of unmatched crockery and under a roof of leaves. I\r\nwouldn't have a plate different in the whole camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor would I,\" said Adam.\r\n\r\nShe looked across at the mountain-panorama, for, though stationary, it\r\nwas also forever changing, and the light of intense and burning noon was\r\ndifferent from the humid veil of morning.\r\n\r\n\"And yonder goes a sail,\" she tacked to the end of her\r\nmountain-observations.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven speed it!\" responded Adam, carrying his cup for a second filling\r\nto the coffee-pot on the stove. \"Will ye have a drop more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, yes. I don't know how many drops more I shall drink. We get so\r\nfierce and reckless about our victuals. Will it be the spirit of the old\r\ncounterfeiters who used to inhabit this island entering into us?\"\r\nsuggested Eva, using the English-Canadian idiom of the western\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n\"Without doot. It was their custom never to let a body leave this strond\r\nalive, and they can only hairm us by making us eat oursels to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly a hundred years ago, wasn't it, they lived here and made\r\ncounterfeit money and drew silly folks in to buy it of them? When I hear\r\nthe rocks all over this island sounding hollow like muffled drumming\r\nunder our feet, I scare myself thinking that gang may be hid hereabouts\r\nyet and may come and peep into the tent some night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Behind them all the army of bones they drowned in Magog watther or\r\nburied in the island,\" laughed Adam. \"It's not for a few old ghosts we'd\r\ntake up our pans and kettles and move out of the Gairden of Eden. I'll\r\nkeep you safe from the counterfeiters, my darling, never fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said heaven speed that sail yonder; but the man has taken it down\r\nand is rowing in here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he's an impudent loon. Who asked him?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sight of our tent, very likely. And maybe it will be some friend of\r\nours, stopping at the Magog House. He wears a white helmet-hat; and\r\nisn't that a yachting-suit of white flannel?\"\r\n\r\n\"He comes clothed as an angel of light,\" said Adam.\r\n\r\nThey both watched the figure and the boat growing larger in perspective.\r\nFeatures formed in the blur under the rower's hat; his individuality\r\nsprung suddenly from a shape which a moment ago might have been any\r\nman's.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Adam, it will be Louis Satanette from Toronto,\" exclaimed Eva.\r\n\r\n\"And what's a Toronto man doing away up on Lake Magog?\"\r\n\r\n\"What will a Glasgow man be doing away off here on Lake Magog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Camping with his wife, and getting more religion than ever was taught\r\nin the creeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure of that, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't love a Frenchman?\"\r\n\r\n\"A French-Canadian. And a member of Parliament, too. Think of that at\r\nhis age! They say in Toronto he is one of the most promising men in the\r\nprovinces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can he spear a salmon with a gaff, and does he know a pairch from a\r\nlunge? And he couldn't be a Macgregor, anyhow, if he was first man in\r\nCanada.\"\r\n\r\nEva laughed, and, forming her lips into a kiss, slyly impressed the same\r\nupon the air, as if it could reach Adam through some invisible pneumatic\r\ntube. He was not ashamed to make a return in kind; and, the boat being\r\nnow within their bay, they went down to the sand to meet it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFORBIDDEN FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spotless procession the days moved along until that morning on which\r\nAdam dreamed his dream. He waked up trembling with joy and feeling the\r\ntears run down his face. His watch ticked like the beating of a pulse\r\nunder his pillow, and he kept time to its rhythm with whispered words no\r\nhuman ear would ever hear him utter with such rapture.\r\n\r\nHe had dreamed of breasting oceans and groping through darkness after\r\nhis wife until he was ready to die. Then, while he lay helpless, she\r\ncame to him and lifted him up in her arms. There was perfect and\r\nunearthly union between them. His happiness became awful. He woke up\r\nshaken by it as by a hand of infinite power.\r\n\r\nInstead of turning toward her, he was still. Such experiences cannot be\r\ntold. The tongue falters and words limp when we try to repeat them to\r\nthe one beloved. A divine shame keeps us silent. Perhaps the glory of\r\nthat perfect love puts a halo around our common thoughts and actions for\r\ndays afterward, but no man or woman can fitly say, \"I was in heaven with\r\nyou, my other soul, and the gladness was so mighty that I cried\r\nhelplessly long after I woke.\"\r\n\r\nAdam kept his sleeve across his eyes. He had risked his life in many an\r\nadventure without changing a pulse-beat, but now he was an infant in the\r\ngrasp of emotion.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he cast a furtive glance at Eva's cot, she was not there.\r\nShe often slipped out in the early morning to drench herself with dew.\r\nOnce he had discovered her stooping on the sand, washing soiled clothes\r\nin the lake. She clapped and rubbed the garments between soap and her\r\nlittle fists. The sun was just coming up in the far northeast. Shapes of\r\nmist gyrated slowly upward in the distance, and all the morning birds\r\nwere rushing about, full of eager business. Eva stopped her humming song\r\nwhen she saw him, and laughed over her unusual employment. The first\r\ntime she ever washed clothes in her life she wanted to have Magog for\r\nher tub and accomplish the labor on a vast and princess-like scale. Adam\r\nhelped her spread the wet things on bushes, and they both marvelled at\r\nthe bleached dazzle which the sun gave to those garments.\r\n\r\nHe did not move from the cot, hoping awhile that she might come in,\r\ndew-footed, and yet kiss him. That clear shining of the face which one\r\nsometimes observes in pure-minded devotees, or in young mothers over\r\ntheir firstborn, gave him a look of nobility in the pallid shadow of the\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nHe thought of all their days on the island, and, incidentally, of Louis\r\nSatanette's frequent comings. The Frenchman was a beautiful, versatile\r\nfellow. He sailed a boat, he swam, he fished knowingly, he sang like an\r\nangel, leaning his head back against a tree to let the moonlight touch\r\nup his ivory face and silky moustache and eyebrows. He had firm,\r\nmarble-white fingers, nicely veined, on which reckless exposure to sun\r\nand wind had no effect, and the kindliest blue eyes that ever beamed\r\nequal esteem upon man and woman. Sometimes this Satanette came in a\r\nblue-flannel suit, the collar turned well back from the throat, and in a\r\nbroad straw hat wound with pink and white tarlatan. He looked like a\r\nflower,--if any flower ever expressed along with its beauty the powerful\r\nnerve of manliness.\r\n\r\nFrequently he sailed out from Magog House and stayed all night on the\r\nisland, slinging his own hammock between trees. Then he and Adam rose\r\nearly and trolled for lunge in deep water under the cliff. In the\r\nafternoon they all plunged into the lake, Eva swimming like a\r\ncardinal-flower afloat. Adam was careful to keep near her, and finally\r\nto help her into the boat, where she sat with her scarlet bathing-dress\r\nshining in the sun and her drenched hair curling in an arch around her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAll these days flashed before Adam while he put a slow foot out on the\r\ntent-rug.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody about the camp when he had made his morning toilet and\r\nunclosed the tent-flaps, so he built a fire in the stove, hung the\r\nbedding to sun, and set out the cots. A blueness which was not humid\r\nfiltered itself through the air everywhere, and fold upon fold of it\r\nseemed rising from invisible censers on the mainland.\r\n\r\nEva hailed him from the lake. She came rowing across the sun's track.\r\nThe water was fresh and blue, glittering like millions of alternately\r\ndull and burnished scales.\r\n\r\nAdam drew the boat in and lifted her out, more tenderly but with more\r\nreticence than usual.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know where I have been, laddie,\" exclaimed Eva. \"Look at all\r\nthe fern and broken bushes in the boat; and I have my pocket sagged\r\ndown with gold-streaked quartz. I went around to the other side of the\r\nisland, where the counterfeiters' hole is, to look into it while the\r\nmorning sun on the lake threw a reflection.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing wonderful to be seen there.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will we know that? The rocks sound hollow all about, and there may\r\nbe a great cavern full of counterfeiters' relics. Oh, Adam, I saw Louis\r\nSatanette's sail!\"\r\n\r\n\"He comes early this morn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he has been camping by himself over on the lake-shore. He says\r\nwe'll explore the counterfeiters' hole, and let us go directly after\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it worth the exploring?\" said Adam. \"Four rocks set on end, and\r\nyou crawl in on your hands and knees, look at the dark, and back out\r\nagain. It's but a burrow, and ends against the hill's heart of rock.\r\nI've to row across yonder for the eggs and butter and milk.\"\r\n\r\nThe smoke rising from different points on the mainland kept sifting and\r\nsifting until at high noon the air was pearl-gray. As if there was not\r\nenough shadow betwixt him and the sun, Adam sat in his boat at the foot\r\nof the cliff, where brown glooms never rose quite off the water. He\r\nlooked down until sight could pierce no farther, and, though a fish or\r\ntwo glided in beautiful curves beneath his eye, he had no hook dropped\r\nin as his excuse for loitering.\r\n\r\nThe eggs and butter and milk for which he had rowed across the lake were\r\ncovered with green leaves under one of the boat-benches.\r\n\r\nStraight above him, mass on mass, rose those protruding ribs of the\r\nearth, the rocks. He lay back in the boat's stern and gazed at their\r\nsummit of pinetrees and ferns. Bunches of gigantic ferns sprouted from\r\nevery crevice, and not a leaf of the array but was worth half a\r\nlifetime's study. Yet Adam's eye wandered aimlessly over it all, as if\r\nit gave him no pleasure. Nor did he seem to wish that a little figure\r\nwould bend from the summit, half swallowed in greenness and made a\r\nvegetable mermaid from the waist downward, to call to him. He was so\r\nhaggard the freckles stood in bold relief upon his face and neck.\r\n\r\nThe hiss of a boat and the sound of row-locks failed to move him from\r\nhis listless attitude. He did, however, turn his eyes and set his jaws\r\nin the direction of the passing oarsman. Louis Satanette was all in\r\nwhite flannel, and flush-faced like a cream-pink rose with pleasant\r\nexhilaration. He held his oars poised and let his boat run slowly past\r\nAdam.\r\n\r\n\"What have you the matter?\" he exclaimed, with sincere anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's naught,\" said Adam. \"I'm just weary, weary.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been gone a very, very long time,\" said Louis, using the\r\ndouble Canadian adjective. \"Mrs. Macgregor is on the lookout.\"\r\n\r\nAdam thought of her when she was _not_ on the lookout. He also thought\r\nof her tidying things about the camp in the morning, and singing as he\r\npulled from the bay. Perhaps she was on another sort of lookout then.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go in presently,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"Beg pardon?\" said Louis Satanette, bending forward, and giving the\r\nupward inflection to that graceful Canadian phrase which asks a\r\nrepetition while implying that the fault is with the hearer.\r\n\r\n\"I said I'd go in presently. There's no hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to take you in,\" said Louis. \"You have approached too close\r\nto the altars of the sylvan gods, and their sacrificial smoke has\r\novercome you. Don't you see it rising everywhere from the woods?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sylvan gods are none of my clan,\" remarked Adam, shifting his\r\nposition impatiently, \"and it's little I know of them. There's a graat\r\ndail of ignorance consailed aboot my pairson.\"\r\n\r\nLouis Satanette laughed with enjoyment:\r\n\r\n\"Well, _au revoir_. I will put up my sail when I turn the points. It\r\nwill be a long run up the lakes, with this haze hanging and not wind\r\nenough to lift it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-day to ye,\" responded Adam. \"We'll likely shift camp before you're\r\nthis way.\"\r\n\r\n\"In so short a time?\" exclaimed Louis.\r\n\r\n\"In so lang a time. I'm soul-sick of it. It's lone; it's heavy. The\r\nfine's too great for the pleasure of the feight. Look, now,--there were\r\ntwo rough laddies up Glazka way, in my country, and they came to fists\r\naboot a sweethairt, the fools. But when they are stripped and ready, one\r\nhits the table wi's hond, and says he, 'Ay, Georgie, I'm wullin' to\r\nfeight ye, but wha's goin' to pay the fine?'\"\r\n\r\nLouis Satanette laughed again, but as if he did not know just what was\r\nmeant.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a cautious mon, is the Scotchmon,\" said Adam, \"but no' so slow,\r\nafter all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never slow!\" said Louis. \"Very, very fast indeed, to leave this\r\nparadise in the midst of the summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Farewell to lovely Loch Achray,'\" sighed Adam:\r\n    \"Where shall we find, in any land,\r\n    So lone a lake, so sweet a strand?\"\r\n\r\nLouis made a sign of adieu and dipped his oars.\r\n\r\n\"It's only _au revoir_,\" said he, shooting past. \"Be very, very far from\r\nparting with Magog too early.\"\r\n\r\n\"'So lone a lake, so sweet a strand,'\" repeated Adam, dropping his head\r\nback against the stern.\r\n\r\nHe did not move while the sound of the other's oars died away behind\r\nhim. He did not move while the afternoon shadows spread far over the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe long Canadian twilight advanced stage by stage. First, all Magog\r\nflushed, as if a repetition of the old miracle had turned it to wine.\r\nThen innumerable night-hawks uttered their four musical notes in endless\r\nsuccession, upon the heights, down in the woods, from the mainland\r\nmountain. The north star became discernible almost overhead. Then, with\r\nslow and irregular strokes, Adam pulled away from the cliff, and brought\r\nhis keel to grate the sand in front of his tent.\r\n\r\nEva was sitting there on a rock, huddling a shawl around her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Adam Macgregor!\" she began, in a low voice, \"and do you condescend\r\nto bring your wraith back to me at last?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing but my wraith,\" said Adam, lifting his eggs and butter and\r\nmilk, and stepping from the boat. \"The mon in me died aboot noon.\"\r\n\r\nEva walked along by his side to the cool-box, where he deposited his\r\nload.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you, laddie, that you look and talk so\r\nstrangely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, naught,\" said Adam, turning and facing her. \"I but saw you kissing\r\nLouis Satanette on the hill to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLAMING SWORD.\r\n\r\nThe changes which passed over her face were half concealed by the\r\ntwilight. She was grieved, indignant, and frightened, but over all other\r\nexpressions lurked the mischievous mirth of a bad child.\r\n\r\n\"I meant to tell you about it,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Hearken,\" said Adam, with a fierce stare. \"I've stayed out on the lake\r\nall day, and I'm quiet. At first I wasn't. But when he came by I gave\r\nhim nothing but a good word.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd scolded him instead of me,\" said Eva, propping her back\r\nagainst the table and puckering her lips.\r\n\r\n\"_He_ did naught,\" said Adam, \"but what any man would do that got lave.\r\nIt's you that gave him lave that are to blame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so serious about a little thing,\" put forth Eva. \"We just\r\nwalked over to the counterfeiters' hole, and coming back we picked\r\nstrawberries, and he teased me like a girl, and caught hold of me and\r\nkissed me. We've been such good friends in camp. I think it's this easy,\r\nwild life made me do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll blame the very sky over her instead of taking blame to\r\nherself,\" ground out Adam from between his jaws. \"I sat in me boat\r\nbelow and saw you arch your head and look at him ways that I remember.\r\nMy God! why did you make this woman so false, and yet so sweet that a\r\nmon canna help loving her in spite o' his teeth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I'd die if folks didn't love me,\" burst out Eva, with a sob.\r\n\"And if men can't help loving me, what do you blame me for?\"\r\n\r\n\"What right have you to breathe such a word when you're married to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not used to being married yet,\" pleaded Eva. \"And I forgot,\r\nthis once.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's once and for all,\" said Adam, \"You'll never be to me what you were\r\nbefore. Is it the English-Canadian way to bring up women to kiss every\r\ncomer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't kiss anybody but Louis Satanette,\" maintained Eva, \"and I\r\ndidn't really _want_ to kiss _him_\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Adam. \"Don't trouble your butterfly soul about it.\"\r\nAnd he turned away and walked toward the tent.\r\n\r\n\"I'll not love you if you say such awful things to me,\" she flashed\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n\"Ye can't take the breeks off a Hielandman,\" he replied, facing about,\r\n\"Ye never loved me. Not as I loved you. And it's no loss I've met, if I\r\ncould but think it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Adam!\" Now she ran forward and caught him around the waist. \"Don't\r\nbe so hard with me. I know I am very bad, but I didn't mean to be.\"\r\n\r\nSome faint perception of that coarse fibre within her was breaking with\r\nhorror through her face. She held to his hands after he had separated\r\nher from his person and held her off.\r\n\r\n\"All that you do still has its effect on me,\" said the man, gazing\r\nsternly at her. \"I love ye; but I despise myself for loving ye. This\r\nmorn I adored ye with reverence; this night you're as a bit o' that\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nEva let go his hands and sat down on the ground. As he made his\r\npreparations in the tent he could not help seeing with compassion how\r\nabjectly her figure drooped. All its flexible proud lines, were suddenly\r\ngone. She was dazed by his treatment and by the light in which he put\r\nher trifling. She sat motionless until Adam came out with one of the\r\ncots in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"I'm to sleep upon the hill in the pine woods to-night,\" said he. \"Go\r\ninto the tent, and I'll fasten the flaps. You shan't be scared by\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me get in the boat and leave the island, if you can't breathe the\r\nsame air with me,\" said Eva. staggering up.\r\n\r\n\"No, I can't breathe the same air with ye to-night, but ye'll go into\r\nthe tent,\" said Adam, with authority.\r\n\r\n\"I'll not stay there,\" she rebelled. \"I'll follow you. You don't know\r\nwhat may be on this island.\"\r\n\r\n\"There can be nothing worse than what I've seen,\" said Adam; \"and that's\r\ndone all the hairm it can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Adam, are we both crazy?\" the small creature burst out, weeping as\r\nif her heart would break. \"Don't go away and leave me so. I am not real\r\nbad in my heart, I know I am not; and if you would be a little patient\r\nwith me and help me, I shall get over my silly ways. There is something\r\nin me, you can depend upon, if I _did_ do that foolish thing. And my\r\nmother didn't live long enough to train me, Adam; remember that. Won't\r\nyou please kiss me? My heart is breaking.\"\r\n\r\nHe put down the cot and took her by the shoulders, trembling as he did\r\nso from head to foot:\r\n\r\n\"My wife, I belaive what you say. I'd give all the days remaining to me\r\nif I could strain ye against my breast with the feeling I had this morn.\r\nBut there comes that sight. I never shall see the hill again, I never\r\nshall see a spot of this island again, without seeing your mouth kissing\r\nanother man. Go into the tent. God knows I'd die before hairm should\r\ncome to you. But not to-night can I stay beside you. Or kiss you.\"\r\n\r\nHe carried her into the tent and put her on her bed. She had made all\r\nthe night-preparations herself, placing the pillows on both cots and\r\nturning back the sun-sweetened blankets.\r\n\r\nAdam left her sobbing, buttoned the tent-flaps outside, and placed a\r\nbarricade of kettles and pans which could not be touched without\r\ndisturbing him on the hill. Then, taking up his own bed, he marched off\r\nthrough the ferns, edging his burden among dense boughs as he ascended.\r\n\r\nWhen he had made the joints of his couch creak with many uneasy\r\nturnings, had clinched at leaves, and started up to return to the tent,\r\nonly to check himself in the act as often as he started, he lost\r\nconsciousness in uneasy dreams rather than fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe was smothering, and yet could not open his lips to gasp for a breath\r\nof air. Then he was drowning: he gulped in vast sheets of water upon his\r\nlungs. An alarm sounded from Eva's barricade. He heard the pans and\r\nkettles clanging and her own voice in screams which pierced him, yet he\r\ncould not move. A nightmare of heat enveloped him; the smothering\r\nelement pouring upon his lungs was not water, but smoke; and he knew if\r\nno effort of will could move his body to her rescue he must be perishing\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAfter these brief sensations his existence was as blank as the empty\r\nvoid outside the worlds, until his ears began to throb like drums, and\r\nhe felt water, like the tears he had shed in the morning, running all\r\nover his face. Eva held him in her arms, and alternately kissed his head\r\nand drenched it from the lake.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he was in the boat, outside the bay, and their island glowed\r\nlike a furnace before his dazzled eyes.\r\n\r\nThose pine woods where he had gone to sleep were roaring up toward\r\nheaven in a column of fire. The tent was burning, all its interior\r\nilluminated until every object showed its minutest lines. He thought he\r\nsaw some of Eva's dark hairs in an upturned hair-brush on the\r\nwash-stand.\r\n\r\nFire ran along the cliff-edge and dropped hissing brands into the lake.\r\nOld moss logs and pine-trees dry as tinder sent out sickening heat. The\r\nlight ran like a flash up the tree over their stove, and in an instant\r\nits crown was wavering with flames. The grass itself caught here and\r\nthere, and in whatever direction the eye turned, new fires as\r\ninstantaneously sprang out to meet it.\r\n\r\nStumps blazed up like lighted altars, or like huge gas-jets suddenly\r\nturned on. Adam saw one log lying endwise downhill, one side of which\r\nwas crumbling into coals of fierce and tremulous heat, while from the\r\nother side still sprung unsinged a delicate tuft of ferns.\r\n\r\nThe smoke was driving straight upward in a quivering current, and in\r\nLake Magog's depths another island seemed to be on fire.\r\n\r\nSublime as the sight was, all these details impressed themselves on the\r\nman in an instant, and he turned his face directly up toward the woman.\r\n\r\n\"Darling, your face looks blistered,\" said Adam.\r\n\r\n\"It feels blistered,\" replied Eva. \"I'll put some water on it, now that\r\nyou've caught your breath again. I thought I could not get you out from\r\nthose burning trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you dragged me down the hill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and then dipped you in the lake and pushed off with you in the\r\nboat. I don't know how I did it. But here we are together.\"\r\n\r\nAdam bathed her face carefully himself, and held her tight in his arms.\r\nThe unspeakable love of which he had dreamed, and the heat of the\r\nburning island, seemed welding them together without other sign than the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nNot a word was sighed out for forgiveness on either side. They held each\r\nother and floated back into the lake. Adam took an oar and occasionally\r\npaddled, without wholly releasing his hold of Eva.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember our fish's nest?\" she whispered beside his neck. \"I\r\nwonder if the slim little silver thing is swimming around over the\r\ngravel hollow, frightened by all this glare? I hope those overhanging\r\nbushes won't catch fire and drop coals on her; for she's a silly\r\nthing,--she might not want to dart out in deep water and lose her\r\nunhatched family.\"\r\n\r\nAdam smiled into his wife's eyes.

II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe route of Robertson lay over the great Indian war-path, which led, in\r\na southwesterly direction, from the valley of Virginia to the Cherokee\r\ntowns on the lower Tennessee, not far from the present city of\r\nChattanooga. He would, however, turn aside at the Tellico and visit\r\nEchota, which was the home of the principal chiefs. While he is pursuing\r\nhis perilous way, it may be as well to glance for a moment at the people\r\namong whom he is going at so much hazard.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees were the mountaineers of aboriginal America, and, like\r\nmost mountaineers, had an intense love of country and a keen\r\nappreciation of the beautiful in nature, as is shown by the poetical\r\nnames they have bequeathed to their rivers and mountains. They were\r\nphysically a fine race of men, tall and athletic, of great bravery and\r\nsuperior natural intelligence. It was their military prowess alone that\r\nenabled them to hold possession of the country they occupied against the\r\nmany warlike tribes by whom they were surrounded.\r\n\r\nThey had no considerable cities, or even villages, but dwelt in\r\nscattered townships in the vicinity of some stream where fish and game\r\nwere found in abundance. A number of these towns, bearing the musical\r\nnames of Tallassee, Tamotee, Chilhowee, Citico, Tennassee, and Echota,\r\nwere at this time located upon the rich lowlands lying between the\r\nTellico and Little Tennessee Rivers. These towns contained a population,\r\nin men, women, and children, estimated at from seven to eight thousand,\r\nof whom perhaps twelve hundred were warriors. These were known as the\r\nOttari (or \"among the mountains\") Cherokees.\r\n\r\nAbout the same number, near the head-waters of the Savannah, in the\r\ngreat highland belt between the Blue Ridge and the Smoky Mountains, were\r\nstyled the Erati (or \"in the valley\") Cherokees. Another body (among\r\nwhom were many Creeks), nearly as large, and much more lawless than\r\neither of the others, occupied towns lower down the Tennessee and in the\r\nvicinity of Lookout Mountain. These, from their residence near the\r\nstream of that name, were known as the Chickamaugas.\r\n\r\nThese various bodies were one people, governed by an Archimagus, or\r\nKing, who, with a supreme council of chiefs, which sat at Echota,\r\ndecided all important questions in peace or war. Under him were the\r\nhalf-or vice-king and the several chiefs who governed the scattered\r\ntownships and together composed the supreme council. In them was lodged\r\nthe temporal power. Spiritual authority was of a far more despotic form\r\nand character. It was vested in one person, styled the Beloved man or\r\nwoman of the tribe, who, over a people so superstitious as the\r\nCherokees, held a control that was wellnigh absolute. This person was\r\ngenerally of superior intelligence, who, like the famous Prophet of the\r\nShawnees, officiated as physician, prophet, and intercessor with the\r\ninvisible powers; and, by virtue of the supernatural authority which he\r\nclaimed, he often by a single word decided the most important questions,\r\neven when opposed by the king and the principal chiefs.\r\n\r\nEchota was located on the northern bank of the Tellico, about five miles\r\nfrom the ruins of Fort Loudon, and thirty southwest from the present\r\ncity of Knoxville. It was the Cherokee City of Refuge. Once within its\r\nbounds, an open foe, or even a red-handed criminal, could dwell in peace\r\nand security. The danger to an enemy was in going and returning. It is\r\nrelated that an Englishman who, in self-defence, once slew a Cherokee,\r\nfled to this sacred city to escape the vengeance of the kindred of his\r\nvictim. He was treated here with such kindness that after a time he\r\nthought it safe to leave his asylum. The Indians warned him against the\r\ndanger, but he left, and on the following morning his body was found on\r\nthe outskirts of the town, pierced through and through with a score of\r\narrows.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred cabins and wigwams, scattered, with some order but at\r\nwide intervals, along the bank of the river, composed the village. The\r\ncabins, like those of the white settlers, were square and built of logs;\r\nthe wigwams were conical, with a frame of slender poles gathered\r\ntogether at the top and covered with buffalo-robes, dressed and smoked\r\nto render them impervious to the weather. An opening at the side formed\r\nthe entrance, and over it was hung a buffalo-hide, which served as a\r\ndoor. The fire was built in the centre of the lodge, and directly\r\noverhead was an aperture to let out the smoke. Here the women performed\r\nculinary operations, except in warm weather, when such employments were\r\ncarried on outside in the open air. At night the occupants of the lodge\r\nspread their skins and buffalo-robes on the ground, and then men, women,\r\nand children, stretching themselves upon them, went to sleep, with their\r\nfeet to the fire. By day the robes were rolled into mats and made to\r\nserve as seats. A lodge of ordinary size would comfortably house a dozen\r\npersons; but two families never occupied one domicile, and, the\r\nCherokees seldom having a numerous progeny, not more than five or six\r\npersons were often tenants of a single wigwam.\r\n\r\nThese rude dwellings were mostly strung along the two sides of a wide\r\navenue, which was shaded here and there with large oaks and poplars and\r\ntrodden hard with the feet of men and horses. At the back of each lodge\r\nwas a small patch of cleared land, where the women and the negro slaves\r\n(stolen from the white settlers over the mountains) cultivated beans,\r\ncorn, and potatoes, and occasionally some such fruits as apples, pears,\r\nand plums. All labor was performed by the women and slaves, as it was\r\nconsidered beneath the dignity of an Indian brave to follow any\r\noccupation but that of killing, either wild beasts in the hunt or\r\nenemies in war. The house-lots were without fences, and not an enclosure\r\ncould be seen in the whole settlement, cattle and horses being left to\r\nroam at large in the woods and openings.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of Echota, occupying a wide opening, was a circular,\r\ntower-shaped structure, some twenty feet high and ninety in\r\ncircumference. It was rudely built of stout poles, plastered with clay,\r\nand had a roof of the same material sloping down to broad eaves, which\r\neffectually protected the walls from moisture. It had a wide entrance,\r\nprotected by two large buffalo-hides hung so as to meet together in the\r\nmiddle. There were no windows, but an aperture in the roof, shielded by\r\na flap of skins a few feet above the opening, let out the smoke and\r\nadmitted just enough light to dissipate a portion of the gloom that\r\nalways shrouded the interior. Low benches, neatly made of cane, were\r\nranged around the circumference of the room. This was the great\r\ncouncil-house of the Cherokees. Here they met to celebrate the\r\ngreen-corn dance and their other national ceremonials; and here the king\r\nand half-king and the princes and head-men of the various towns\r\nconsulted together on important occasions, such as making peace or\r\ndeclaring war.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I write, several of the log cabins of Echota were\r\noccupied by traders, adventurous white men who, tempted by the profit of\r\nthe traffic with the Cherokees, had been led to a more or less constant\r\nresidence among them. Their cabins contained their stock in\r\ntrade,--traps, guns, powder and lead, hatchets, looking-glasses,\r\n\"stroud,\" beads, scarlet cloth, and other trinkets, articles generally\r\nof small cost, but highly prized by the red-men, and for which they gave\r\nin exchange peltries of great value. The trade was one of slow returns,\r\nbut of great profits to the trader. And it was of about equal advantage\r\nto the Indian; for with the trap or rifle he had gotten for a few skins\r\nhe was able to secure more game in a day than his bow and arrow and rude\r\n\"dead-fall\" would procure for him in a month of toilsome hunting. The\r\ntraders were therefore held in high esteem among the Cherokees, who\r\nencouraged their living and even marrying among them. In fact, such\r\nalliances were deemed highly honorable, and were often sought by the\r\ndaughters of the most distinguished chiefs. Consequently, among the\r\ntrader's other chattels would often be found a dusky mate and a\r\nhalf-dozen half-breed children; and this, too, when he had already a\r\nwife and family somewhere in the white settlements.\r\n\r\nThese traders were an important class in the early history of the\r\ncountry. Of necessity well acquainted with the various routes traversing\r\nthe Indian territory, and with the state of feeling among the savages,\r\nand passing frequently to and fro between the Indian towns and the white\r\nsettlements, they were often enabled to warn the whites of intended\r\nattacks, and to guide such hostile parties as invaded the Cherokee\r\nterritory. Though often natives of North Carolina or Virginia, and in\r\nsympathy with the colonists, they were, if prudent of speech and\r\nbehavior, allowed to remain unmolested in the Indian towns, even when\r\nthe warriors were singing the war-song and brandishing the war-club on\r\nthe eve of an intended massacre of the settlers.\r\n\r\nLiving in Echota at this time was one of this class who, on account of\r\nhis great services to the colonists, is deserving of special mention.\r\nHis name was Isaac Thomas, and he is said to have been a native of\r\nVirginia. He is described as a man about forty years of age, over six\r\nfeet in height, straight, long-limbed, and wiry, and with a frame so\r\nsteeled by twenty years of mountain-life that he could endure any\r\nconceivable hardship. His features were strongly marked and regular, and\r\nthey wore an habitual expression of comic gravity; but on occasion his\r\ndark, deep-set eye had been known to light up with a look of\r\nunconquerable pluck and determination. He wore moccasins and\r\nhunting-shirt of buckskin, and his face, neck, and hands, from long\r\nexposure, had grown to be of the same color as that material. His\r\ncoolness and intrepidity had been shown on many occasions, and these\r\nqualities, together with his immense strength, had secured him high\r\nesteem among the Cherokees, who, like all uncivilized people, set the\r\nhighest value upon personal courage and physical prowess. It is related\r\nthat shortly before the massacre at Fort Loudon he interfered in a\r\ndesperate feud between two Cherokee braves who had drawn their tomahawks\r\nto hew each other in pieces. Stepping between them, he wrenched the\r\nweapons from their hands, and then, both setting upon him at once, he\r\ncooled their heated valor by lifting one after the other into the air\r\nand gently tossing him into the Tellico. Subsequently, one of these\r\nbraves saved his life at the Loudon massacre, at the imminent risk of\r\nhis own. If I were writing fiction, I might make of this man an\r\ninteresting character: as it is, it will be seen that facts hereinafter\r\nrelated will fully justify the length of this description.\r\n\r\nA wigwam, larger and more pretentious than most of the others in Echota,\r\nstood a little apart from the rest, and not far from the council-house.\r\nLike the others, it had a frame of poles covered with tanned skins; but\r\nit was distinguished from them by a singular \"totem,\"--an otter in the\r\ncoils of a water-snake. Its interior was furnished with a sort of rude\r\nsplendor. The floor was carpeted with buffalo-hides and panther-skins,\r\nand round the walls were hung eagles' tails, and the peltries of the\r\nfox, the wolf, the badger, the otter, and other wild animals. From a\r\npole in the centre was suspended a small bag,--the mysterious\r\nmedicine-bag of the occupant. She was a woman who to this day is held in\r\ngrateful remembrance by many of the descendants of the early settlers\r\nbeyond the Alleghanies. Her personal appearance is lost to tradition,\r\nbut it is said to have been queenly and commanding. She was more than\r\nthe queen, she was the prophetess and Beloved Woman, of the Cherokees.\r\n\r\nAt this time she is supposed to have been about thirty-five years of\r\nage. Her father was an English officer named Ward, but her mother was of\r\nthe \"blood royal,\" a sister of the reigning half-king Atta-Culla-Culla.\r\nThe records we have of her are scanty, as they are of all her people,\r\nbut enough has come down to us to show that she had a kind heart and a\r\nsense of justice keen enough to recognize the rights of even her\r\nenemies. She must have possessed very strong traits of character to\r\nexercise as she did almost autocratic control over the fierce and\r\nwellnigh untamable Cherokees when she was known to sympathize with and\r\nbefriend their enemies the white settlers. Not long before the time of\r\nwhich I am writing, she had saved the lives of two whites,--Jeremiah\r\nJack and William Rankin,--who had come into collision with a party of\r\nCherokees; and subsequently she performed many similar services to the\r\nfrontier people.\r\n\r\nOther wigwams as imposing as that of Nancy Ward, and not far from the\r\ncouncil-house, were the habitations of the head-king Oconostota, the\r\nhalf-king Atta-Culla-Culla, and the prince of Echota, Savanuca,\r\notherwise called the Raven. Of these men it will be necessary to say\r\nmore hereafter: here I need only remark that they have now gathered in\r\nthe council-house, with many of the principal warriors and head-men of\r\nthe Ottari Cherokees, and that the present fate of civilization in the\r\nSouthwest is hanging on their deliberations.\r\n\r\nThey are of a gigantic race, and none of those at this conclave, except\r\nAtta-Culla-Culla, are less than six feet in height \"without their\r\nmoccasins.\" Squatted as they are gravely around the council-fire, they\r\npresent a most picturesque appearance. Among them are the\r\nBread-Slave-Catcher, noted for his exploits in stealing negroes; the\r\nTennassee Warrior, prince of the town of that name; Noon-Day, a\r\nwide-awake brave; Bloody Fellow, whose subsequent exploits will show the\r\nappropriateness of his name; Old Tassell, a wise and reasonably just\r\nold man, afterward Archimagus; and John Watts, a promising young\r\nhalf-breed, destined to achieve eminence in slaughtering white people.\r\n\r\nAs one after another of them rises to speak, the rest, with downcast\r\neyes and cloudy visages, listen with silent gravity, only now and then\r\nexpressing assent by a solitary \"Ugh!\"\r\n\r\nThere is strong, though suppressed, passion among them; but it is\r\npassion under the control of reason. Whatever they decide to do will be\r\ndone without haste, and after a careful weighing of all the\r\nconsequences. In the midst of their deliberations the rapid tread of a\r\nhorse's feet is heard coming up the long avenue. The horseman halts\r\nbefore the council-house, and soon the buffalo-hide parts in twain, and\r\na tall young warrior, decorated with eagles' feathers and half clad in\r\nthe highest style of Cherokee fashion, enters the door-way. He stands\r\nsilent, motionless, not moving a pace beyond the entrance, till\r\nOconostota, raising his eyes and lifting his huge form into an erect\r\nposture, bids him speak and make known his errand.\r\n\r\nThe young brave explains that the chief of the pale-faces has come down\r\nthe great war-path to an outlying town to see the head-men of the\r\nOttari. The warriors have detained him till they can know the will of\r\ntheir father the Archimagus.\r\n\r\nThe answer is brief: \"Let him come. Oconostota will hear him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now an hour goes by, during which these grave chiefs sit as silent\r\nand motionless as if keeping watch around a sepulchre. At its close the\r\ntramp of a body of horsemen is heard, and soon Robertson, escorted by a\r\nscore of painted warriors, enters the council-chamber. Like the rest,\r\nthe new-comers are of fine physical proportions; and, as the others rise\r\nto their feet and all form in a circle about him, Robertson, who stands\r\nonly five feet nine inches and is not so robust as in later years, seems\r\nlike a pygmy among giants. Yet he is as cool, as collected, as\r\napparently unconscious of danger, as if every one of those painted\r\nsavages (when aroused, red devils) was his near friend or\r\nblood-relation. The chiefs glance at him, and then at one another, with\r\nas much wonderment in their eyes as was ever seen in the eyes of a\r\nCherokee. They know he is but one man and they twelve hundred, and that\r\nby their law of retaliation his life is forfeit; and yet he stands\r\nthere, a look of singular power on his face, as if not they but he were\r\nmaster of the situation. They have seen physical bravery; but this is\r\nmoral courage, which, when a man has a great purpose, lifts him above\r\nall personal considerations and makes his life no more to him than the\r\nbauble he wears upon his finger.\r\n\r\nRobertson waits for the others to speak, and there is a short pause\r\nbefore the old chief breaks the silence. Then, extending his hand to\r\nRobertson, he says, \"Our white brother is welcome. We have eaten of his\r\nvenison and drunk of his fire-water. He is welcome. Let him speak.\r\nOconostota will listen.\"\r\n\r\nThe white man returns cordially the grasp of the Indian; and then, still\r\nstanding, while all about him seat themselves on the ground, he makes\r\nknown the object of his coming. I regret I cannot give here his exact\r\nanswer, for all who read this would wish to know the very words he used\r\non this momentous occasion. No doubt they were, like all he said, terse,\r\npithy, and in such scriptural phrase as was with him so habitual. I know\r\nonly the substance of what he said, and it was as follows: that the\r\nyoung brave had been killed by one not belonging to the Watauga\r\ncommunity; that the murderer had fled, but when apprehended would be\r\ndealt with as his crime deserved; and he added that he and his\r\ncompanion-settlers had come into the country desiring to live in peace\r\nwith all men, but more especially with their near neighbors the brave\r\nCherokees, with whom they should always endeavor to cultivate relations\r\nof friendliness and good-fellowship.\r\n\r\nThe Indians heard him at first with silent gravity, but, as he went on,\r\ntheir feelings warmed to him, and found vent in a few expressive\r\n\"Ughs!\" and when he closed, the old Archimagus rose, and, turning to the\r\nchiefs, said, \"What our white brother says is like the truth. What say\r\nmy brothers? are not his words good?\"\r\n\r\nThe response was, \"They are good.\"\r\n\r\nA general hand-shaking followed; and then they all pressed Robertson to\r\nremain with them and partake of their hospitality. Though extremely\r\nanxious to return at once with the peaceful tidings, he did so, and thus\r\nconverted possible enemies into positive friends; and the friendship\r\nthus formed was not broken till the outbreak of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWhile Robertson had been away, Sevier had not been idle. He had put\r\nWatauga into the best possible state of defence. With the surprising\r\nenergy that was characteristic of him, he had built a fort and gathered\r\nevery white settler into it or safe within range of its muskets. His\r\nforce was not a hundred strong; but if Robertson had been safely out of\r\nthe savage hold, he might have enjoyed a visit from Oconostota and his\r\ntwelve hundred Ottari warriors.\r\n\r\nThe fort was planned by Sevier, who had no military training except such\r\nas he had received under his patron and friend Lord Dunmore. Though rude\r\nand hastily built, it was a model of military architecture, and in the\r\nconstruction of it Sevier displayed such a genius for war as readily\r\naccounts for his subsequent achievements.\r\n\r\nIt was located on Gap Creek, about half a mile northeast of the Watauga,\r\nupon a gentle knoll, from about which the trees, and even stumps, were\r\ncarefully cleared, to prevent their sheltering a lurking enemy. The\r\nbuildings have now altogether crumbled away; but the spot is still\r\nidentified by a few graves and a large locust-tree,--then a slender\r\nsapling, now a burly patriarch, which has remained to our day to point\r\nout the spot where occurred the first conflict between civilization and\r\nsavagery in the new empire beyond the Alleghanies. For the conflict was\r\nbetween those two forces; and the forts along the frontier--of which\r\nthis at Watauga was the original and model--were the forerunners of\r\ncivilization,--the \"voice crying in the wilderness,\" announcing the\r\nreign of peace which was to follow.\r\n\r\nThe fort covered a parallelogram of about an acre, and was built of log\r\ncabins placed at intervals along the four sides, the logs notched\r\nclosely together, so that the walls were bullet-proof. One side of the\r\ncabins formed the exterior of the fort, and the spaces between them were\r\nfilled with palisades of heavy timber, eight feet long, sharpened at the\r\nends, and set firmly into the ground. At each of the angles was a\r\nblock-house, about twenty feet square and two stories high, the upper\r\nstory projecting about two feet beyond the lower, so as to command the\r\nsides of the fort and enable the besieged to repel a close attack or any\r\nattempt to set fire to the buildings. Port-holes were placed at suitable\r\ndistances. There were two wide gate-ways, constructed to open quickly to\r\npermit a sudden sally or the speedy rescue of outside fugitives. On one\r\nof these was a lookout station, which commanded a wide view of the\r\nsurrounding country. The various buildings would comfortably house two\r\nhundred people, but on an emergency a much larger number might find\r\nshelter within the enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe fort was admirably adapted to its design, and, properly manned,\r\nwould repel any attack of fire-arms in the hands of such desultory\r\nwarriors as the Indians. In the arithmetic of the frontier it came to be\r\nadopted as a rule that one white man behind a wall of logs was a match\r\nfor twenty-five Indians in the open field; and subsequent events showed\r\nthis to have been not a vainglorious reckoning.\r\n\r\nThere were much older men at Watauga than either Sevier or\r\nRobertson,--one of whom was now only twenty-eight and the other\r\nthirty,--but they had from the first been recognized as natural leaders.\r\nThese two events--the building of the fort and the Cherokee mission,\r\nwhich displayed Sevier's uncommon military genius and Robertson's\r\nability and address as a negotiator--elevated them still higher in the\r\nregard of their associates, and at once the cares and responsibilities\r\nof leadership in both civil and military affairs were thrust upon them.\r\nBut Sevier, with a modesty which he showed throughout his whole career,\r\nwhenever it was necessary that one should take precedence of the other,\r\nalways insisted upon Robertson's having the higher position; and so it\r\nwas that in the military company which was now formed Sevier, who had\r\nserved as a captain under Dunmore, was made lieutenant, while Robertson\r\nwas appointed captain.\r\n\r\nThe Watauga community had been till now living under no organized\r\ngovernment. This worked very well so long as the newly-arriving\r\nimmigrants were of the class which is \"a law unto itself;\" but when\r\nanother class came in,--men fleeing from debt in the older settlements\r\nor hoping on the remote and inaccessible frontier to escape the penalty\r\nof their crimes,--some organization which should have the sanction of\r\nthe whole body of settlers became necessary. Therefore, speaking in the\r\nlanguage of Sevier, they, \"by consent of the people, formed a court,\r\ntaking the Virginia laws as a guide, as near as the situation of affairs\r\nwould admit.\"\r\n\r\nThe settlers met in convention at the fort, and selected thirteen of\r\ntheir number to draft articles of association for the management of the\r\ncolony. From these thirteen, five (among whom were Sevier and Robertson)\r\nwere chosen commissioners, and to them was given power to adjudicate\r\nupon all matters of controversy and to adopt and direct all measures\r\nhaving a bearing upon the peace, safety, good order, and well-being of\r\nthe community. By them, in the language of the articles, \"all things\r\nwere to be settled.\"\r\n\r\nThese articles of association were the first compact of civil government\r\nanywhere west of the Alleghanies. They were adopted in 1772, three years\r\nprior to the association formed for Kentucky \"under the great elm-tree\r\noutside of the fort at Boonesboro.\" The simple government thus\r\nestablished was sufficient to secure good order in the colony for\r\nseveral years following.\r\n\r\nNow ensued four more years of uninterrupted peace and prosperity, during\r\nwhich the settlement increased greatly in numbers and extended its\r\nborders in all directions. The Indians, true to their pledges to\r\nRobertson, continued friendly, though suffering frequently from the\r\ndepredations of lawless white men from the old settlements. These were\r\nreckless, desperate characters, who had fled from the order and law of\r\nestablished society to find freedom for unbridled license in the new\r\ncommunity. Driven out by the Watauga settlers, they herded together in\r\nthe wilderness, where they subsisted by hunting and fishing and preying\r\nupon the now peaceable Cherokees. They were an annoyance to both the\r\npeaceable white man and the red; but at length, when the Indians showed\r\nfeelings of hostility, they became a barrier between the savages and the\r\nindustrious cultivators of the soil, and thus unintentionally\r\ncontributed to the well-being of the Watauga community.\r\n\r\nNo event materially affecting the interests of the colony occurred\r\nduring the four years following Robertson's visit to the Cherokees at\r\nEchota. The battles of Lexington and Concord had been fought, but the\r\nshot which was \"heard round the world\" did not echo till months\r\nafterward in that secluded hamlet on the Watauga. But when it did\r\nreverberate amid those old woods, every backwoodsman sprang to his feet\r\nand asked to be enrolled to rush to the rescue of his countrymen on the\r\nseaboard. His patriotism was not stimulated by British oppression, for\r\nhe was beyond the reach of the \"king's minions.\" He had no grievances to\r\ncomplain of, for he drank no tea, used no stamps, and never saw a\r\ntax-gatherer. It was the \"glorious cause of liberty,\" as Sevier\r\nexpressed it, which called them all to arms to do battle for freedom and\r\ntheir countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"A company of fine riflemen was accordingly enlisted, and embodied at\r\nthe expense and risque of their private fortunes, to act in defence of\r\nthe common cause on the sea-shore.\"[001] But before the volunteers could\r\nbe despatched over the mountains it became apparent that their services\r\nwould be needed at home for the defence of the frontier against the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThrough the trader Isaac Thomas it soon became known to the settlers\r\nthat Cameron, the British agent, was among the Cherokees, endeavoring to\r\nincite them to hostilities against the Americans. At first the Indians\r\nresisted the enticements--the hopes of spoil and plunder and the\r\nrecovery of their hunting-grounds--which Cameron held out to them. They\r\ncould not understand how men of the same race and language could be at\r\nwar with one another. It was never so known in Indian tradition. But\r\nsoon--late in 1775--an event occurred which showed that the virus spread\r\namong them by the crafty Scotchman had begun to work, at least with the\r\nyounger braves, and that it might at any moment break out among the\r\nwhole nation. A trader named Andrew Grear, who lived at Watauga, had\r\nbeen at Echota. He had disposed of his wares, and was about to return\r\nwith the furs he had taken in exchange, when he perceived signs of\r\nhostile feeling among some of the young warriors, and on his return,\r\nfearing an ambuscade on the great war-path, he left it before he reached\r\nthe crossing at the French Broad, and went homeward by a less-frequented\r\ntrail along the Nolachucky. Two other traders, named Boyd and Dagget,\r\nwho left Echota on the following day, pursued the usual route, and were\r\nwaylaid and murdered at a small stream which has ever since borne the\r\nname of Boyd's Creek. In a few days their bodies were found, only half\r\nconcealed in the shallow water; and as the tidings flew among the\r\nscattered settlements they excited universal alarm and indignation.\r\n\r\nThe settlers had been so long at peace with the Cherokees that they had\r\nbeen lulled into a false security; but, the savage having once tasted\r\nblood, they knew his appetite would \"grow by what it fed on,\" and they\r\nprepared for a deadly struggle with an enemy of more than twenty times\r\ntheir number. The fort at Watauga was at once put into a state of\r\nefficient defence, smaller forts were erected in the centre of every\r\nscattered settlement, and a larger one was built on the frontier, near\r\nthe confluence of the north and south forks of the Holston River, to\r\nprotect the more remote settlements. This last was called Fort Patrick\r\nHenry, in honor of the patriotic governor of Virginia. The one at\r\nWatauga received the name of Fort Lee.\r\n\r\nAll the able-bodied males sixteen years of age and over were enrolled,\r\nput under competent officers, and drilled for the coming struggle. But\r\nthe winter passed without any further act of hostility on the part of\r\nthe disaffected Cherokees. The older chiefs, true to their pledges to\r\nRobertson, still held back, and were able to restrain the younger\r\nbraves, who thirsted for the conflict from a passion for the excitement\r\nand glory they could find only in battle.\r\n\r\nNancy Ward was in the secrets of the Cherokee leaders, and every word\r\nuttered in their councils she faithfully repeated to the trader Isaac\r\nThomas, who conveyed the intelligence personally or by trusty messengers\r\nto Sevier and Robertson at Watauga. Thus the settlers were enabled to\r\ncircumvent the machinations of Cameron until a more powerful enemy\r\nappeared among the Cherokees in the spring of 1776. This was John\r\nStuart, British superintendent of Southern Indian affairs, a man of\r\ngreat address and ability, and universally known and beloved among all\r\nthe Southwestern tribes. Fifteen years before, his life had been saved\r\nat the Fort Loudon massacre by Atta-Culla-Culla, and a friendship had\r\nthen been contracted between them which now secured the influence of the\r\nhalf-king in plunging the Cherokees into hostilities with the settlers.\r\n\r\nThe plan of operations had been concerted between Stuart and the\r\nBritish commander-in-chief, General Gage. It was for a universal rising\r\namong the Creeks, Chickasaws, Cherokees, and Shawnees, who were to\r\ninvade the frontiers of Georgia, Virginia, and the Carolinas, while\r\nsimultaneously a large military and naval force under Sir Peter Parker\r\ndescended upon the Southern seaboard and captured Charleston. It was\r\nalso intended to enlist the co-operation of such inhabitants of the back\r\nsettlements as were known to be favorable to the British. Thus the\r\nfeeble colonists were to be not only encircled by a cordon of fire, but\r\na conflagration was to be lighted which should consume every patriot's\r\ndwelling. It was an able but pitiless and bloodthirsty plan, for it\r\nwould let loose upon the settler every savage atrocity and make his\r\nworst foes those of his own household. If successful, it would have\r\nstrangled in fire and blood the spirit of independence in the Southern\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nThat it did not succeed seems to us, who know the means employed to\r\nthwart it, little short of a miracle. Those means were the four hundred\r\nand forty-five raw militia under Moultrie, who, behind a pile of\r\npalmetto logs, on the 28th of June, 1776, repulsed Sir Peter Parker in\r\nhis attack on Sullivan's Island in the harbor of Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, and the two hundred and ten \"over-mountain men,\" under Sevier,\r\nRobertson, and Isaac Shelby, who beat back, on the 20th and 21st of\r\nJuly, the Cherokee invasion of the western frontier.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 30th of May, Sevier and Robertson were apprised by their\r\nfaithful friend Nancy Ward of the intended attack, and at once they sent\r\nmessengers to Colonel Preston, of the Virginia Committee of Safety, for\r\nan additional supply of powder and lead and a reinforcement of such men\r\nas could be spared from home-service. One hundred pounds of powder and\r\ntwice as much lead, and one hundred militiamen, were despatched in\r\nanswer to the summons. The powder and lead were distributed among the\r\nstations, and the hundred men were sent to strengthen the garrison of\r\nFort Patrick Henry, the most exposed position on the frontier. The\r\nentire force of the settlers was now two hundred and ten, forty of whom\r\nwere at Watauga under Sevier and Robertson, the remainder at and near\r\nFort Patrick Henry under no less than six militia captains, no one of\r\nwhom was bound to obey the command of any of the others. This\r\nmany-headed authority would doubtless have worked disastrously to the\r\nloosely-jointed force had there not been in it as a volunteer a young\r\nman of twenty-five who in the moment of supreme danger seized the\r\nabsolute command and rallied the men to victory. His name was Isaac\r\nShelby, and this was the first act in a long career in the whole of\r\nwhich \"he deserved well of his country.\"\r\n\r\nThus, from the 30th of May till the 11th of July the settlers slept with\r\ntheir rifles in their hands, expecting every night to hear the Indian\r\nwar-whoop, and every day to receive some messenger from Nancy Ward with\r\ntidings that the warriors were on the march for the settlements. At last\r\nthe messengers came,--four of them at once,--as we may see from the\r\nfollowing letter, in which Sevier announces their arrival to the\r\nCommittee of Safety of Fincastle County, Virginia:\r\n\r\n     \"FORT LEE, July 11, 1776.\r\n\r\n     DEAR GENTLEMEN,--Isaac Thomas, William Falling, Jarot Williams, and\r\n     one more, have this moment come in, by making their escape from the\r\n     Indians, and say six hundred Indians and whites were to start for\r\n     this fort, and intend to drive the country up to New River before\r\n     they return.\r\n\r\n     JOHN SEVIER.\"\r\n\r\nHe says nothing of the feeble fort and his slender garrison of only\r\nforty men; he shows no sign of fear, nor does he ask for aid in the\r\ngreat peril. The letter is characteristic of the man, and it displays\r\nthat utter fearlessness which, with other great qualities, made him the\r\nhero of the Border. The details of the information brought by Thomas to\r\nSevier and Robertson showed how truthfully Nancy Ward had previously\r\nreported to them the secret designs of the Cherokees. The whole nation\r\nwas about to set out upon the war-path. With the Creeks they were to\r\nmake a descent upon Georgia, and with the Shawnees, Mingoes, and\r\nDelawares upon Kentucky and the exposed parts of Virginia, while seven\r\nhundred chosen Ottari warriors were to fall upon the settlers on the\r\nWatauga, Holston, and Nolachucky. This last force was to be divided into\r\ntwo bodies of three hundred and fifty each, one of which, under\r\nOconostota, was to attack Fort Watauga; the other, under Dragging-Canoe,\r\nhead-chief of the Chickamaugas, was to attempt the capture of Fort\r\nPatrick Henry, which they supposed to be still defended by only about\r\nseventy men. But the two bodies were to act together, the one supporting\r\nthe other in case it should be found that the settlers were better\r\nprepared for defence than was anticipated. The preparation for the\r\nexpedition Thomas had himself seen: its object and the points of attack\r\nhe had learned from Nancy Ward, who had come to his cabin at midnight on\r\nthe 7th of July and urged his immediate departure. He had delayed\r\nsetting out till the following night, to impart his information to\r\nWilliam Falling and Jarot and Isaac Williams, men who could be trusted,\r\nand who he proposed should set out at the same time, but by different\r\nroutes, to warn the settlements, so that in case one or more of them was\r\nwaylaid and killed the others might have a chance to get through in\r\nsafety. However, at the last moment the British agent Cameron had\r\nhimself disclosed the purpose of the expedition to Falling and the two\r\nbrothers Williams, and detailed them with a Captain Guest to go along\r\nwith the Indians as far as the Nolachucky, when they were to scatter\r\namong the settlements and warn any \"king's men\" to join the Indians or\r\nto wear a certain badge by which they would be known and protected in\r\nany attack from the savages. These men had set out with the Indians, but\r\nhad escaped from them during the night of the 8th, and all had arrived\r\nat Watauga in safety.\r\n\r\nThomas and Falling were despatched at once with the tidings into\r\nVirginia, the two Williamses were sent to warn the garrison at Fort\r\nPatrick Henry, and then the little force at Watauga furbished up their\r\nrifles and waited in grim expectation the coming of Oconostota.\r\n\r\nBut the garrison at Fort Patrick Henry was the first to have tidings\r\nfrom the Cherokees. Only a few men were at the fort, the rest being\r\nscattered among the outlying stations, but all were within\r\nsupporting-distance. On the 19th of July the scouts came in and reported\r\nthat a large body of Indians was only about twenty miles away and\r\nmarching directly upon the garrison. Runners were at once despatched to\r\nbring in the scattered forces, and by nightfall the one hundred and\r\nseventy were gathered at the fort, ready to meet the enemy. Then a\r\ncouncil of war was held by the six militia captains to determine upon\r\nthe best plan of action. Some were in favor of awaiting the attack of\r\nthe savages behind the walls of the fort, but one of them, William\r\nCocke, who afterward became honorably conspicuous in the history of\r\nTennessee, proposed the bolder course of encountering the enemy in the\r\nopen field. If they did not, he contended that the Indians, passing them\r\non the flank, would fall on and butcher the defenceless women of the\r\nsettlements in their rear.\r\n\r\nIt was a step of extreme boldness, for they supposed they would\r\nencounter the whole body of seven hundred Cherokees; but it was\r\nunanimously agreed to, and early on the following morning the little\r\narmy, with flankers and an advance guard of twelve men, marched out to\r\nmeet the enemy. They had not gone far when the advance guard came upon a\r\nforce of about twenty Indians. The latter fled, and the whites pursued\r\nfor several miles, the main body following close upon the heels of the\r\nadvance, but without coming upon any considerable force of the enemy.\r\nThen, being in a country favorable to an ambuscade, and the evening\r\ncoming on, they held a council and decided to return to the fort.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone upward of a mile when a large force of the enemy\r\nappeared in their rear. The whites wheeled about at once, and were\r\nforming into line, when the whole body of Indians rushed upon them with\r\ngreat fury, shouting, \"The Unacas are running! Come on! scalp them!\"\r\nThey attacked simultaneously the centre and left flank of the whites;\r\nand then was seen the hazard of going into battle with a many-headed\r\ncommander. For a moment all was confusion, and the companies in\r\nattempting to form in the face of the impetuous attack were being\r\nbroken, when Isaac Shelby rushed to the front and ordered each company a\r\nfew steps to the rear, where they should reform, while he, with\r\nLieutenant Moore, Robert Edmiston, and John Morrison, and a private\r\nnamed John Findlay,--in all five men,--should meet the onset of the\r\nsavages. Instantly the six captains obeyed the command, recognizing in\r\nthe volunteer of twenty-five their natural leader, and then the battle\r\nbecame general. The Indians attacked furiously, and for a few moments\r\nthose five men bore the brunt of the assault. With his own hand Robert\r\nEdmiston slew six of the more forward of the enemy, Morrison nearly as\r\nmany, and then Moore became engaged in a desperate hand-to-hand fight\r\nwith an herculean chieftain of the Cherokees. They were a few paces in\r\nadvance of the main body, and, as if by common consent, the firing was\r\npartly suspended on both sides to await the issue of the conflict.\r\n\"Moore had shot the chief, wounding him in the knee, but not so badly as\r\nto prevent him from standing. Moore advanced toward him, and the Indian\r\nthrew his tomahawk, but missed him. Moore sprung at him with his large\r\nbutcher-knife drawn, which the Indian caught by the blade and attempted\r\nto wrest from the hand of his antagonist. Holding on with desperate\r\ntenacity to the knife, both clinched with their left hands. A scuffle\r\nensued, in which the Indian was thrown to the ground, his right hand\r\nbeing nearly dissevered, and bleeding profusely. Moore, still holding\r\nthe handle of his knife in the right hand, succeeded with the other in\r\ndisengaging his own tomahawk from his belt, and ended the strife by\r\nsinking it in the skull of the Indian. Until this conflict was ended,\r\nthe Indians fought with unyielding spirit. After its issue became known,\r\nthey retreated.\"[002] \"Our men pursued in a cautious manner, lest they\r\nmight be led into an ambuscade, hardly crediting their own senses that\r\nso numerous a foe was completely routed. In this miracle of a battle we\r\nhad not a man killed, and only five wounded, who all recovered. But the\r\nwounded of the enemy died till the whole loss in killed amounted to\r\nupward of forty.\"[003]\r\n\r\nAs soon as this conflict was over, a horseman was sent off to Watauga\r\nwith tidings of the astonishing victory. \"A great day's work in the\r\nwoods,\" was Sevier's remark when speaking subsequently of this battle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Oconostota, with his three hundred and fifty warriors, had\r\nfollowed the trail along the Nolachucky, and on the morning of the 20th\r\nhad come upon the house of William Bean, the hospitable entertainer of\r\nRobertson on his first visit to Watauga, Bean himself was at the fort,\r\nto which had fled all the women and children in the settlement, but his\r\nwife had preferred to remain at home. She had many friends among the\r\nIndians, and she felt confident they would pass her without molestation.\r\nShe was mistaken. They took her captive, and removed her to their\r\nstation-camp on the Nolachucky. There a warrior pointed his rifle at\r\nher, as if to fire; but Oconostota threw up the barrel and began to\r\nquestion her as to the strength of the whites. She gave him misleading\r\nreplies, with which he appeared satisfied, for he soon told her she was\r\nnot to be killed, but taken to their towns to teach their women how to\r\nmanage a dairy.\r\n\r\nThose at the fort knew that Oconostota was near by on the Nolachucky,\r\nbut he had deferred the attack so long that they concluded the wary and\r\ncautious old chief was waiting to be reinforced by the body under\r\nDragging-Canoe, which had gone to attack Fort Patrick Henry. News had\r\nreached them of Shelby's victory, and, as it would be some time before\r\nthe broken Cherokees could rally and join Oconostota, they were in no\r\napprehension of immediate danger. Accordingly, they went about their\r\nusual vocations, and so it happened that a number of the women ventured\r\noutside the fort as usual to milk the cows on the morning of the 21st of\r\nJuly. Among them was one who was destined to occupy for many years the\r\nposition of the \"first lady in Tennessee.\"\r\n\r\nHer name was Catherine Sherrell, and she was the daughter of Samuel\r\nSherrell, one of the first settlers on the Watauga. In age she was\r\nverging upon twenty, and she was tall, straight as an arrow, and lithe\r\nas a hickory sapling. I know of no portrait of her in existence, but\r\ntradition describes her as having dark eyes, flexible nostrils, regular\r\nfeatures, a clear, transparent skin, a neck like a swan, and a wealth of\r\nwavy brown hair, which was a wonder to look at and was in striking\r\ncontrast to the whiteness of her complexion. A free life in the open air\r\nhad made her as supple as an eel and as agile as a deer. It was said\r\nthat, encumbered by her womanly raiment, she had been known to place one\r\nhand upon a six-barred fence and clear it at a single bound. And now her\r\nagility was to do her essential service.\r\n\r\nWhile she and the other women, unconscious of danger, were \"coaxing the\r\nsnowy fluid from the yielding udders of the kine,\" suddenly the\r\nwar-whoop sounded through the woods, and a band of yelling savages\r\nrushed out upon them. Quick as thought the women turned and darted for\r\nthe gate of the fort; but the savages were close upon them in a\r\nneck-and-neck race, and Kate, more remote than the rest, was cut off\r\nfrom the entrance. Seeing her danger, Sevier and a dozen others opened\r\nthe gate and were about to rush out upon the savages, hundreds of whom\r\nwere now in front of the fort; but Robertson held them back, saying they\r\ncould not rescue her, and to go out would insure their own destruction.\r\nAt a glance Kate took in the situation. She could have no help from her\r\nfriends, and the tomahawk and scalping-knife were close behind her.\r\nInstantly she turned, and, fleeter than a deer, made for a point in the\r\nstockade some distance from the entrance. The palisades were eight feet\r\nhigh, but with one bound she reached the top, and with another was over\r\nthe wall, falling into the arms of Sevier, who for the first time called\r\nher his \"bonnie Kate,\" his \"brave girl for a foot-race.\" The other women\r\nreached the entrance of the fort in safety.\r\n\r\nThen the baffled savages opened fire, and for a full hour it rained\r\nbullets upon the little enclosure. But the missiles fell harmless: not a\r\nman was wounded. Driven by the light charges the Indians were accustomed\r\nto use, the bullets simply bounded off from the thick logs and did no\r\ndamage. But it was not so with the fire of the besieged. The order was,\r\n\"Wait till you see the whites of your enemies' eyes, and then make sure\r\nof your man.\" And so every one of those forty rifles did terrible\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nFor twenty days the Indians hung about the fort, returning again and\r\nagain to the attack; but not a man who kept within the walls was even\r\nwounded. It was not so with a man and a boy who, emboldened by a few\r\ndays' absence of the Indians, ventured outside to go down to the river.\r\nThe man was scalped on the spot; the boy was taken prisoner, and\r\nsubjected to a worse fate in one of the Indian villages. His name was\r\nMoore, and he was a younger brother of the lieutenant who fought so\r\nbravely in the battle near Fort Patrick Henry.\r\n\r\nAt last, baffled and dispirited, the Indians fell back to the Tellico.\r\nThey had lost about sixty killed and a larger number wounded, and they\r\nhad inflicted next to no damage upon the white settlers. They were\r\nenraged beyond bounds and thirsting for vengeance. Only two prisoners\r\nwere in their power; but on them they resolved to wreak their extremest\r\ntortures. Young Moore was taken to the village of his captor, high up in\r\nthe mountains, and there burned at a stake. A like fate was determined\r\nupon for good Mrs. Bean, the kindly woman whose hospitable door had ever\r\nbeen open to all, white man or Indian. Oconostota would not have her\r\ndie; but Dragging-Canoe insisted that she should be offered up as a\r\nsacrifice to the _manes_ of his fallen warriors; and the head-king was\r\nnot powerful enough to prevent it.\r\n\r\nShe was taken to the summit of one of the burial-mounds,--those relics\r\nof a forgotten race which are so numerous along the banks of the\r\nTellico. She was tied to a stake, the fagots were heaped about her, and\r\nthe fire was about to be lighted, when suddenly Nancy Ward appeared\r\namong the crowd of savages and ordered a stay of the execution.\r\nDragging-Canoe was a powerful brave, but not powerful enough to combat\r\nthe will of this woman. Mrs. Bean was not only liberated, but sent back\r\nwith an honorable escort to her husband.\r\n\r\nThe village in which young Moore was executed was soon visited by Sevier\r\nwith a terrible retribution; and from that day for twenty years his name\r\nwas a terror among the Cherokees.\r\n\r\nBefore many months there was a wedding in the fort at Watauga. It was\r\nthat of John Sevier and the \"bonnie Kate,\" famous to this day for\r\nleaping stockades and six-barred fences. He lived to be twelve years\r\ngovernor of Tennessee and the idol of a whole people. She shared all his\r\nlove and all his honors; but in her highest estate she was never ashamed\r\nof her lowly days, and never tired of relating her desperate leap at\r\nWatauga; and, even in her old age, she would merrily add, \"I would make\r\nit again--every day in the week--for such a husband.\"\r\n\r\n     EDMUND KIRKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLEASANT SPIRIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was drawing toward nine o'clock, and symptoms of closing for the\r\nnight were beginning to manifest themselves in Mr. Pegram's store. The\r\nfew among the nightly loungers there who had still a remnant of domestic\r\nconscience left had already risen from boxes and \"kags,\" and gathered up\r\nthe pound packages of sugar and coffee which had served as the pretext\r\nfor their coming, but which would not, alas! sufficiently account for\r\nthe length of their stay. The older stagers still sat composedly in the\r\nseats of honor immediately surrounding the red-hot stove, and a look of\r\ndisapproval passed over their faces as Mr. Pegram, opening the door and\r\nthereby letting in a blast of cold air upon their legs, proceeded to put\r\nup the outside shutters.\r\n\r\n\"In a hurry to-night, ain't you, Pegram?\" inquired Mr. Dickey, as the\r\nproprietor returned, brushing flakes of snow from his coat and shivering\r\nexpressively.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not particular,\" replied Mr. Pegram, with a deliberation which\r\nconfirmed his words, \"but it's pretty nigh nine, and Sally she ast me\r\nnot to be later _than_ nine to-night, for our hired girl's gone\r\nhome for a spell, and that makes it kind of lonesome for Sally: the baby\r\ndon't count for much, only when he cries, and I'll do him the justice to\r\nsay that isn't often.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a new thing for Sally to be scary, ain't it?\" queried Mr.\r\nCrumlish, with an expression of mild surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, I may say it is,\" admitted Mr. Pegram; \"but, you know, we\r\nhad a kind of a warning, before we moved in, that all wasn't quite as it\r\nshould be, and, as bad luck would have it, there was a Boston paper come\r\nround her new coat, with a story in it that laid out to be true, of\r\nnoises and appearances, and one thing and another, in a house right\r\nthere to Boston, and Sally she says to me, 'If they believe in them\r\nthings to Boston, where they don't believe in nothing they can't see and\r\nhandle, if all we hear's true, there must be something in it, and I only\r\nwish I'd read that piece before we took the house.'\r\n\r\n\"I keep a-telling her we've neither seen nor heard nothing out of the\r\ncommon, so far, but all she'll say to that is, 'That's no reason we\r\nwon't;' and sure enough it isn't, though I don't tell her so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely,\" said Mr. Birchard, the young schoolmaster, who boarded\r\nwith Mr. Dickey, \"you don't believe any such trash as that account of a\r\nhaunted house in Boston?\" There was a non-committal silence, and he went\r\non impatiently, \"I could give you a dozen instances in which mysteries\r\nof this kind, when they were energetically followed up, were proved to\r\nbe the results of the most simple and natural causes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like enough, like enough, young man,\" said Uncle Jabez Snyder, in his\r\ntremulous tones, \"and mebbe some folks not a hunderd miles from here\r\ncould tell you another dozen that hadn't no natural causes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like very much to hear them,\" replied the young man, with an\r\nexasperatingly incredulous smile.\r\n\r\n\"If Pegram here wasn't in such a durned hurry to turn us out and shet\r\nup,\" said Mr. Dickey, with manifest irritation, \"Uncle Jabez could tell\r\nyou all you want to hear.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pegram looked disturbed. It was with him a fixed principle never to\r\ndisoblige a customer, and he saw that he was disobliging at least half a\r\ndozen. On the other hand, he was not prepared to face his wife should he\r\nso daringly disregard her wishes as to keep the store open half an hour\r\nlater than usual. He pondered for a few moments, and then his face\r\nsuddenly brightened, and he said, \"If one of you gentlemen that passes\r\nmy house on your way home would undertake to put coal on the fire, put\r\nthe lights out, lock the door, and bring me the key, the store's at your\r\ndisposal till ten o'clock; and I'm only sorry I can't stay myself.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three immediately volunteered, but as the schoolmaster and Mr.\r\nDickey were the only ones whose way lay directly past Mr. Pegram's door,\r\nit was decided that they should divide the labors and honors between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like you not to stop later _than_ ten,\" said Mr. Pegram\r\ndeprecatingly, as he buttoned his great-coat and drew his hat down over\r\nhis eyes, \"for I have to be up so early, since that boy cleared out,\r\nthat I need to go to bed sooner than I mostly do.\"\r\n\r\nCompliance with this modest request was readily promised, good-nights\r\nwere exchanged, and the lessened circle drew in more closely around the\r\nstove, for several of the company had reluctantly decided that, all\r\nthings considered, it would be the better part of valor for them to go\r\nwhen Mr. Pegram went.\r\n\r\nThere was a few minutes' silence, and then Mr. Dickey said impatiently,\r\n\"We're all ready, Uncle Jabez. Why don't you fire away, so's to be\r\nthrough by ten o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a-thinkin' which one I'd best tell him,\" said Uncle Jabez mildly.\r\n\"They're all convincin' to a mind that's open to convincement, but I'd\r\nlike to pick out the one that's most so.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the one about Alviry Pratt's grandfather,\" suggested Mr.\r\nCrumlish encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" mused the old man. \"I've no doubt of that myself, but then it\r\ndidn't happen to me in person, and I've a notion he'd rather hear one\r\nI've experienced than two I've heard tell of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I would, Uncle Jabez,\" said Mr. Birchard kindly, but with an\r\namused twinkle in his eyes. \"You take your own time: it's only just\r\nstruck nine, and there's no hurry at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Supposin' I was to tell him that one about my first wife?\" said the old\r\nman presently, and with an inquiring look around the circle.\r\n\r\nSeveral heads were nodded approvingly, and Mr. Crumlish said, \"The very\r\none I'd 'a' chosen myself if you'd ast me.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Uncle Jabez, with a sort of deliberate promptness,\r\nbegan: \"We married very young, Lavina and me,--too young, some said, but\r\nI never could see why, for I had a good farm, with health and strength\r\nto carry it on, and she was a master-hand with butter and cheese. At any\r\nrate, we thriv; and if we had plenty of children, there was plenty for\r\n'em to eat, and they grew as fast as everything else did. She wasn't\r\nwhat you'd fairly call handsome, Lavina wasn't, but she was\r\npleasant-appearin', very,--plump as a pa'tridge, with nice brown hair\r\nand eyes and a clean-lookin' skin. But it was her smile in particular\r\nthat took me; and when she set in to laugh you couldn't no more' help\r\nlaughin' along with her than one bobolink can help laughin' back when he\r\nhears another. She was the tenderest-hearted woman that ever breathed\r\nthe breath of life: she couldn't bear to hurt the feelin's of a cat, and\r\nshe'd go 'ithout a chicken-dinner any day sooner'n kill a chicken. As\r\ntime passed on and she begun to age a little, she grew stouter 'n'\r\nstouter; but it didn't seem to worry her none. She'd puff and blow a\r\ngood bit when she went up-stairs, but she'd always laugh about it, and\r\nsay that when we was rich enough we'd put in an elevator, like they had\r\nat a big hotel we saw once. It would suit her fine, she said, to set\r\ndown on a cushioned seat and be up-stairs afore she could git up again.\r\nNow, you needn't think I'm wanderin' from the p'int,\" and Uncle Jabez\r\nlooked severely at Mr. Dickey, who was manifestly fidgeting. \"All you\r\nfolks that have lived about here all your lives knew Lavina 'ithout my\r\ntellin' you this; but Mr. Birchard he's a stranger in the neighborhood,\r\nand it's needful to the understandin' of my story that he should know\r\njust what sort of a woman she was,--or is, as I should say.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dickey subsided, while Mr. Birchard tried to throw still more of an\r\nexpression of the deepest interest and attention into his face. He must\r\nhave succeeded, for the old man, going on with his story, fixed his eyes\r\nmore and more frequently upon those of the young one. They were large,\r\ngentle, appealing blue eyes, with a mildly surprised expression, which\r\nMr. Birchard found exceedingly attractive. Whether or not the fact that\r\nthe youngest of Uncle Jabez's children, a daughter, had precisely\r\nsimilar eyes, in any way accounted for the attraction, I leave to minds\r\nmore astute than my own.\r\n\r\n\"You may think,\" the narrator resumed, when he felt that he had settled\r\nMr. Dickey, \"whether or not you'd miss a woman like that, when you'd\r\nsummered and wintered with her more'n forty year. She always said she\r\nhoped she'd go sudden, for she was so heavy it would 'a' took three or\r\nfour of the common run of folks to lift her, and she dreaded a long\r\nsickness. Well, she was took at her word. We was settin', as it might be\r\nnow, one on one side the fire, the other on t'other, in the big\r\neasy-cheers that Samuel--that's our oldest son, and a good boy, if I do\r\nsay it--had sent us with the fust spare money he had. She'd been\r\nlaughin' and jokin', as she so often did, five minutes afore.\r\nGracie--she was a little thing then, and, bein' the youngest, a little\r\nsassy and sp'iled, mebbe--had been on a trip to the city, and she'd\r\nbrought her ma a present of a shoe-buttoner with a handle a full foot\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\"'There, ma,' she says, laughin' up in her mother's face; 'you was\r\ncomplainin' about the distance it seemed to be to your feet: here's a\r\nkind of a telegraft-pole to shorten it a little.'\r\n\r\n\"My, how we did laugh! And Lavina must needs try it right away, to\r\nplease Gracie; and she said it worked beautiful. But whether it was the\r\nlaughin' so much right on top of a hearty supper, or the bendin' down to\r\ntry her new toy, or both, she jest says, as natural as I'm speakin' now,\r\n'Jabez, I'm a-goin'--' and then stopped. And when I looked up to see why\r\nshe didn't finish, she was gone, sure enough.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice broke, and he stopped abruptly. Mr. Birchard, without in the\r\nleast intending to do it, grasped his hand, and held it with\r\naffectionate warmth for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, young man, thank you kindly,\" said Uncle Jabez, recovering\r\nhis voice and shaking Mr. Birchard's hand heartily at the same moment.\r\n\"You've an uncommon feelin' heart for one so young.\r\n\r\n\"To say I was lonesome after she went don't say much; but time evens\r\nthings out after a while, or we couldn't stand it as long as we do.\r\nGracie she settled into a little woman all at once, as you may say, and\r\nseemed older for a while than she does now. The rest was all married and\r\ngone, but one boy,--a good boy, too. But they came around me, comfortin'\r\nand helpin', though each one of 'em mourned her nigh as much as I did\r\nmyself; and after a while, as I said, I got used, in a manner, to doin'\r\n'ithout her.\"\r\n\r\nHere he made a long pause, with his eyes intently fixed upon the\r\ndarkness of the adjoining store-room. The heat from the stove had become\r\ntoo great after the shutting of the shutters, and one of the men had\r\nopened an inner door for ventilation.\r\n\r\nNow, as one pair of eyes after another followed those of the old man,\r\nthere was a sort of subdued stir around the circle, and the\r\nschoolmaster, to his intense disgust, caught himself looking hastily\r\nover his shoulder,--the door being behind him.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickey broke the spell by suddenly rising, with the exclamation, \"I\r\nthink we're cooled off about enough; and, as I'm a little rheumaticky\r\nto-night, I'll shut that door, if you've none of you no objections.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a subdued murmur of assent, the door was closed, and Uncle\r\nJabez returned to the thread of his discourse:\r\n\r\n\"Lemme see: where was I? Oh, yes. You may think it a little strange,\r\nnow, but I didn't neither see nor hear tell of her for a full six\r\nmonths. If I was makin' this story up, and anxious to make a _good_\r\nstory of it, you can see, if you're fair-minded, that I'd say she came\r\nback right away. Now, wouldn't I be most likely to? Say?\"\r\n\r\nHe appealed so directly to Mr. Birchard, pausing for a reply, that the\r\nsceptic was obliged to answer in some way, and, with a curious sort of\r\nreluctance, he said slowly, \"Yes--I suppose--I'm sure you would.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to satisfy Uncle Jabez, and he went on with his story:\r\n\r\n\"I came home from town one stormy night, about six months after she\r\ndied, pretty well beat out,--entirely so, I may say. I'd been drivin'\r\nsome cattle into the city, and I'd had only a poor concern of a boy to\r\nhelp me. The cattle was contrai-ry,--contrai-rier'n common; and I\r\nremember thinkin', when the feller at the drove-yard handed me my check,\r\nthat I'd earned it pretty hard. That's the last about it I do remember.\r\nI s'pose I must 'a' put it in my pocket-book, the same as usual; but I\r\nrode home in a sort of a maze, I was so tired and drowsy, and I'd barely\r\nsense enough to eat my supper and grease my boots afore I went to bed. I\r\nhad a bill to pay the next day, and I opened my pocket-book, quite\r\nconfident, to take out the check. It wasn't there. I always kep' a\r\nnumber of papers in that pocket-book, and I thought at fust it had got\r\nmislaid among 'em: so I turned everything out, and unfolded 'em one by\r\none, and poked my finger through a hole between the leather and the\r\nlinin', and made it a good deal bigger,--but that's neither here nor\r\nthere,--and before I was through I was certain sure of one thing,---\r\nthat wherever else that check was, it wasn't in that pocket-book. Then I\r\ntried my pockets, one after the other,--four in my coat, four in my\r\novercoat, three in my vest, two in my pants: no, it wasn't in any of\r\nthem, and I begun to feel pretty queer, I can tell you. It was my only\r\nsale of cattle for the season; I was dependin' on it to pay a bill and\r\nbuy one or two things for Gracie; and, anyhow, it's no fun to lose a\r\nhunderd-dollar check and feel as if it must have been bewitched away\r\nfrom you. I rode back to the drove-yard, though I wasn't more'n half\r\nrested from the day before, and they said they'd stop payment on the\r\ncheck and give me a chance to look right good for it, and if I couldn't\r\nfind it they'd draw me another. You see, they knowed me right well, and\r\nthey wasn't afraid I was tryin' to play any sort of a game on 'em.\r\nStill, it wasn't a pleasant thing to have happen, for, say the best you\r\ncould of it, it argued that I'd lost a considerable share of my wits.\r\nSo, when I come home, I felt so kind of worried and down-hearted that I\r\ncouldn't half eat my supper; and that worried Gracie,--she was a\r\nthin-skinned little critter, and if I didn't eat the same as usual she'd\r\nalways take it into her head there was something wrong with the\r\nvictuals. I fell asleep in my cheer right after supper, and slept till\r\nnine o'clock; and then Gracie woke me, and ast me if I didn't think I'd\r\nbetter go to bed. I said yes, I s'posed I had; but by that time I was\r\nhungry, and I ast her what she had good in the pantry. She brightened up\r\nwonderful at that,--though when I come to look closer at her I see she'd\r\nbeen cryin',--and she said there was doughnuts, fresh fried that day,\r\nand the best half of a mince pie. I told her that was all right so far\r\nas it went, but I'd like somethin' a little solider to begin with: so\r\nshe found me a few slices of cold pork and one of her cowcumber pickles,\r\nand I eat a right good supper. She picked at a piece of pie, by way of\r\nkeepin' me company, but she didn't eat much. Now, I tell you this, which\r\nyou may think isn't revelant to the subject, to let you see I went to\r\nbed comfortable. We laughed and talked over our little supper, and\r\npretended we was city-folks, on our way home from the theater, gettin' a\r\nfancy supper at Delmonico's. And I forgot all about the check for the\r\ntime bein', as slick and clean as if I'd never had it nor lost it. But,\r\nnevertheless, when I went to sleep I begun to dream about it, and was to\r\nthe full as much worried in my dream as I was when I was awake. I seemed\r\nto myself to be huntin' all over the house, in every hole and corner I\r\ncould think of, and sometimes I'd come on pieces of paper that looked so\r\nlike it outside I'd make sure I'd found it, and then when I opened 'em\r\nthey'd be ridickilous rhymes, 'ithout any sense to 'em; when all of a\r\nsudden I heard Lavina's voice, as plain as you hear mine now. It seemed\r\nto come from a good ways off just at first, callin' 'Father,'--she\r\nalways called me 'Father,' partly because she didn't like the name of\r\nJabez, and it is a humbly name, I'm free to confess,--and then again\r\nnearer, 'Father;' and then again, as if it was right at the foot of the\r\nstairs. And this time it went on to say, loud and plain, so's 't I could\r\nhear every word, 'You look in the little black teapot on the top shelf\r\nof the pantry, where I kep' the missionary money, and see what you'll\r\nfind.' And with that I heard her laugh; and I'd know Lavina's laugh\r\namong a thousand. I was too dazed like to do it right away, and I must\r\n'a' fell asleep while I was thinkin' about it, for when I woke up it was\r\nbroad daylight and Gracie was callin' to me to get up. But I hadn't\r\nforgot a word that Lavina'd said, and I went for that teapot as quick as\r\nI was dressed, and there was the check, sure enough, in good order and\r\ncondition!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused to look round at his audience and see the effect of this\r\nstatement, and the schoolmaster took advantage of the pause to ask,\r\n\"Were you in the habit of putting money in that teapot for safe-keeping,\r\nUncle Jabez?\"\r\n\r\n\"Young man, I was not,\" said Uncle Jabez emphatically, and evidently\r\nannoyed both by the question and by the tone in which it was uttered.\r\n\"It was a little notion of Lavina's, and I'd never meddled with it, one\r\nway or the other. But I'd left it be there after she died, because I\r\nliked to look at it. I'd no more 'a' dreamed of puttin' that check in it\r\nthan I would of puttin' it into Gracie's work-box. But there it was, and\r\nhow it come there it wasn't vouchsafed me to know.\r\n\r\n\"I think it must have been a matter of three or four months after this,\r\nthough I wouldn't like to say too positive, that I fell into my first\r\nand last lawsuit. A man I'd always counted a good neighbor made out he'd\r\nfound an old title-deed which give him a right to a smart slice off'n my\r\nbest meadow-land. It dated fifty years back, and old Peter Pinnell, that\r\nwas the only surveyor in the township at that time, made out he\r\nrecollected runnin' the lines; and when McKellop, the feller that\r\nclaimed the track, took old Pinnell over the ground, to see if he could\r\nfind any landmarks that would help to make the claim good, they found a\r\nbig pine-tree jest where they wanted to find it, and cut into it at the\r\nright height to find a 'blaze,' if there was one. The rings was marked\r\nas plain as the lines on a map, and when they'd cut through fifty, there\r\nwas the mark, sure enough, and McKellop's lawyer crowed ready to hurt\r\nhimself. I was a good deal cut down, I can tell you, for I could see\r\npretty well that it was goin' to turn the scale; and when supper-time\r\ncame, Gracie could hardly coax me to the table. I said no, I didn't feel\r\nto be hungry; for I couldn't get that strip of meadow-land out of my\r\nhead. And it wasn't so much the value of the land, either, though I\r\ncouldn't well afford to lose it, as it was the idee of McKellop's\r\ncrowin' and cacklin' all over the neighborhood about it. But Gracie\r\nlooked so anxious and tired that I come to the table, jest to satisfy\r\nher; and I found I was hungry, after all, for I'd been trampin' round\r\nthe farm most of the day, lookin' for some landmark or sign that would\r\nprove my claim, that dated seventy years back. I recollect we had soused\r\npigs' feet for supper that night; and I don't think I ever tasted better\r\nin my life. I eat pretty free of them, as I always did of anything I\r\nliked, and we wound up with some of her canned peaches, that she'd got\r\nout to coax me to eat, and cream on 'em 'most as thick as butter: she\r\nhad a skimmer with holes into it that she always skimmed the cream with\r\nfor our own use. She'd made as good a pot of coffee as I ever tasted.\r\nAnd when I'd had all I wanted, I felt a good deal better, and I says to\r\nher,--'I'll fret over it no more, Gracie: if it's his'n, let him take it\r\n'ithout more words.'\r\n\r\n\"She read me a story out of the paper that made us both laugh right\r\nhearty, and then a chapter, as usual, and then we went to bed. And all\r\ncome round jest as it did afore. I thought I was roamin' about the farm,\r\nas I had been pretty nigh all day; but things was changed round,\r\nsomehow, and the further I went the more mixed up they got, till, jest\r\nas I'd found the pine-tree, I heard Lavina's voice, the same as I'd done\r\nafore,--first far, and then near,--sayin', 'Father;' and the third time\r\nshe said it, when it sounded close to, she went on to say, 'He's done\r\nhis cuttin', now do you do yours. You cut through twenty more rings, and\r\nyou'll find the blaze that marks _your_ survey. And then thank him\r\nkindly for givin' you the idee. The smartest of folks is too smart for\r\nthemselves once in a while.' And with that she laughed her own jolly,\r\nhearty laugh; but that was the last she said; and I laid there wonderin'\r\nand thinkin' for a while, and then dropped off to sleep. But it was all\r\nas clear as a bell in my head in the morning, and I had McKellop and old\r\nPeter at the pine-tree by eight o'clock. I'd sharpened my axe good, I\r\ncan tell you, and it didn't take me long to cut through twenty more\r\nrings, and there, sure enough, was the blaze; and if ever you see a\r\nblue-lookin' man, that man was McKellop; for as soon as old Peter see\r\nthe blaze he recollected hearin' his father tell about the survey; he\r\nrecollected it particular because the old man was a good judge of\r\napple-jack, and he'd said that _my_ father'd gi'n him some of the\r\nbest, that day the survey was made, that he'd ever tasted. And Peter\r\nsaid he reckoned he could find something about it in his father's books\r\nand among some loose papers he had in a box. And, sure enough, he found\r\nenough to make my claim as clear as a bell and make McKellop's as flat\r\nas a pancake. Now, what do you think of _that_, hey?\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the old man peered into Birchard's face, and the schoolmaster\r\nanswered one question with another, after the custom of the country:\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever know anything about the blazed tree before McKellop found\r\nthe blaze?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I come to think it over, I found I did,\" said Uncle Jabez, falling\r\nall unconscious into the trap set for him. \"I hadn't no papers about it,\r\nbut my father had told me all the ins and outs of it when I was a boy,\r\nand it had somehow gone out of my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you mean by 'Ah' in this connection,\" said Uncle\r\nJabez, speaking with unwonted sharpness; \"but if you're misdoubtin' what\r\nI tell you I may as well shet up and go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't doubt your word in the least, Uncle Jabez; I assure you I\r\ndon't,\" Mr. Birchard hastened to say. \"And I'm deeply interested. I hope\r\nyou will go on and tell me all your experiences of this kind. I've heard\r\nand read a good many ghost-stories; but in all of them the ghosts were\r\nmalicious creatures, who seemed to come back chiefly for the fun of\r\nscaring people out of their wits. Yours is the first really benevolent\r\nand well-meaning ghost of which I have ever heard; and it interests me\r\nimmensely; for I never could see why a person who was all goodness and\r\ngenerosity while he--or she--was alive should turn into an unmitigated\r\nnuisance after dying. I should think, if they must needs come back, they\r\nmight just as well be pleasant about it and make people glad to see--or\r\nhear--them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly the view I've always taken,\" said Mr. Crumlish modestly;\r\n\"and one reason I've never felt to doubt any of Uncle Jabez's stories is\r\nthat all the ghosts he's ever seen or heard tell of have been\r\ndecent-behaving ghosts, that didn't come back just for the fun of\r\nscaring people to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so; that's so,\" said the old man, entirely mollified, and\r\nhearing no note of sarcasm in the schoolmaster's rapidly-uttered\r\neloquence. \"If any one of 'em was to behave ugly,\" he continued, \"it\r\nwould shake my faith in the whole thing considerable; for I couldn't\r\nbring myself to believe that anybody I've ever knowed could be so far\r\ngiven over as to want to be ugly after dyin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, I don't know,\" said Mr. Dickey argumentatively. \"I\r\n_hev_ knowed certain folks that it seems to me would stick to their\r\nugliness alive or dead, and, though I've never seen no appearances of\r\nany kind, as I may say, I can believe jist as easy that some of 'em come\r\nback for mischief as that others come back for good.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a few minutes' constrained silence after this remark. Mr.\r\nDickey's first wife had been what is popularly known as \"a Tartar,\" and\r\nthere was a generally current rumor that as the last shovelful of earth\r\nwas patted down on her grave he had been heard to murmur, \"Thanks be to\r\npraise, she's quiet at last.\" The idea of her reappearance in her wonted\r\nhaunts was indeed a dismaying one, especially as Mr. Dickey had recently\r\nmarried again, and, if the gossips knew anything about it, was repeating\r\nmuch of his former painful experience. The silence, which was becoming\r\nembarrassing, was finally broken by the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\"Had you any more experiences of the kind you have just related, Uncle\r\nJabez?\" he asked, in tones of such deep respect and lively interest that\r\nUncle Jabez responded, with gratifying promptness,--\r\n\r\n\"Plenty, plenty, though perhaps them two that I've just told you was the\r\nmost strikin'. But it always seemed to me, after that first time, that\r\nLavina was on hand when anything went wrong or was likely to go wrong;\r\nand ef I was to tell you all the scrapes she's kep' me out of and pulled\r\nme out of, I should keep you settin' here all night. There was one\r\nmore,\" he continued, \"that struck me a good deal at the time. It was\r\nabout money, like the fust one, in a different sort of way. It was\r\ndurin' those days when specie was so skurce and high that it was quite a\r\ncircumstance to get a piece of hard money. There come along a peddler in\r\na smart red wagon, with all sorts of women's trash packed into it, and\r\nGracie took it into her head to want some of his things. It happened to\r\nbe her birthday that day, and, as she didn't often pester me about\r\nclothes, I told her to choose out what she wanted, up to five dollars'\r\nworth, and, if the feller could change me a twenty-dollar note, I'd pay\r\nfor it. He jumped at it, sayin' he didn't count it any trouble at all to\r\ngive change, the way some storekeepers did, and that he always kep' a\r\nlot on hand to oblige his customers. I will say for him that it seemed\r\nto me he give Gracie an amazin' big five dollars' worth, and when he\r\ncome to make the change he handed out a ten-dollar gold piece, or what I\r\nthen took to be such, as easy as if he'd found it growin' on a bush, and\r\nsaid nothin' whatever about the premium on it. Perhaps I'd ought to have\r\nmentioned it, but it seemed to me it was his business more'n mine: so I\r\njest took it as if it was the most natural thing in life, and he went\r\noff. I thought I might as well as not get the premium on it before it\r\nwent down the way folks said it was goin' to: so, after dinner, I\r\nharnessed up, and drove down to the post-office,--it was kep' in the\r\ndrug-store then, the same as it is now,--and when I handed my gold piece\r\nto the postmaster, which was also the druggist, and said I'd take a\r\nquarter's worth of stamps, and I believed gold was worth a dollar\r\nfifteen just now, he first smelt of it, and then bit it, and then poured\r\nsome stuff out'n a bottle onto it, and then handed it back to me with a\r\npityin' smile that somehow riled me more'n a little, and he says, says\r\nhe,--\r\n\r\n\"'Somebody's fooled you badly, Uncle Jabez. That coin's a counterfeit.\r\nDo you happen to know where you got it?'\r\n\r\n\"'I know well enough,' I says, and I expect I spoke pretty mad, for I\r\n_felt_ mad. 'I got it of a travellin' peddler, that's far enough\r\naway by this time, and if you're sure it's bad I'm that much out of\r\npocket.' He seemed right concerned about it, and ast me if I hadn't no\r\nclue that I could track the peddler by; but I couldn't think of any, and\r\nI went home a good deal down in the mouth. But Gracie chirked me up, as\r\nshe always does, bless her! and she made me a Welsh rabbit for supper,\r\nand some corn muffins, and a pot of good rich chocolate, by way of a\r\nchange, and we agreed that, as she'd a pretty big five dollars worth and\r\nas the rest of the change was good, we'd say no more about it, for it\r\nwould be like lookin' for a needle in a hay-stack to try to track him.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, father,' she says, 'I don't so much as know his name: do you?'\r\n\r\n\"I told her no, I didn't; that if I'd heard his name I disremembered it,\r\nbut that I didn't think I'd heard it. And then that very night come\r\nanother visit from mother, and she told me all about it. She come the\r\nway she always did, and when she spoke the last time, close to, as you\r\nmay say, she says,--\r\n\r\n\"'I wouldn't give up that ten dollars so easy, if I was you, father.\r\nThat peddler's name is Hanigan,--Elwood Hanigan,--and he'll be at the\r\nState Fair to-morrow. Now, do you go, and you'll find his red wagon with\r\nno trouble at all; and jest be right down firm with him, and tell him\r\nthat if he doesn't give you good money in place of the bad he foisted\r\noff on you you'll show him up to the whole fair, and you'll see how glad\r\nhe'll be to settle it.'\r\n\r\n\"And with that she laughed jest as natural as life, and I heard no more\r\ntill Gracie knocked on my door in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you go to the fair and find him and get your money back?\" asked\r\nBirchard, who was interested in spite of his scepticism.\r\n\r\n\"I did, jest that,\" replied Uncle Jabez. \"I got off bright and early,\r\nand, as luck would have it, I'd jest tied and blanketed my horse when\r\nthat wonderful smart red wagon come drivin' in at the gate. I waited\r\ntill he'd begun to pull his wares out and make a fine speech about 'em,\r\nand then I jest walked up to him, cool and composed, and give him his\r\nchoice between payin' me good money for his bogus gold or hearin'\r\n_me_ make a speech; and you may jest bet your best hat he paid up\r\nquicker'n winkin'. Perhaps I'd ought to have warned folks ag'in' him as\r\nit was, but I had a notion he'd save his tricks till he got to another\r\nneighborhood; and it turned out I was right. He didn't give none of his\r\ngold change out that day. But you can see for yourself that if it hadn't\r\nbeen for Lavina he'd have come off winnin' horse in that race. That was\r\nalways the way when mother was about: she had more sense in her little\r\nfinger than I had in my whole body, and head too, for that matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you found that you really had not known the man's name until it was\r\nconveyed to you in the manner in which you have described?\" asked the\r\nschoolmaster deferentially.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no,\" said Uncle Jabez. \"When I saw his wagon the next day, I\r\nremembered of readin' his name in gilt letters on the side, tacked to\r\nsome patent medicine he claimed to have invented; but I don't suppose\r\nI'd ever thought of it again if mother hadn't told it to me so plain.\"\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster said nothing. He had his own neat little theories\r\nconcerning all the manifestations which had been mentioned, but somehow\r\nthe old man's guileless belief had touched him, and he had no longer any\r\ndesire to shake it, even had it been possible to do so. But he could not\r\nhelp probing the subject a little further: so presently he asked, \"And\r\nyou've never spoken to her, never asked her if it were not possible for\r\nyou to see as well as hear her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Young man,\" said Uncle Jabez kindly, but solemnly, \"there's such a sin\r\nas presumption, and there's some old sayin' or other about fools rushin'\r\nin where angels fear to tread. If you try to grab too much at once,\r\nyou're apt to lose all. If it was meant for me to see mother as well as\r\nhear her, I _should_ see her; and if I was to go to pryin' round\r\nand tryin' to find out what's purposely hid from me, I make no doubt but\r\nI should lose the little that's been vouchsafed to me. But I'd far\r\nrather hear you ask questions like that than to have you throwin' doubt\r\non the whole business, as you seemed inclined to do at fust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Mr. Dickey briskly, \"do you know it's well on to\r\nhalf-past ten? and we were to have the key at Pegram's by ten. I think\r\nwe'd better do what there is to do, and clear out of this as quick as we\r\nknow how, and mebbe some of us will wish before an hour's gone that we\r\nhad Uncle Jabez's knack at makin' out a good story.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak for yourself, Dickey,\" said Mr. Crumlish good-naturedly.\r\n\"There's some of us that goes in and comes out, with nobody to care\r\nwhich it is, nor how long we stay; but freedom has its drawbacks, as\r\nwell as other things.\"\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster laughed at himself for striking a match as he turned\r\nthe last light out, but he felt moving through his brain a vague wish\r\nthat Uncle Jabez would break himself of that trick he had of gazing\r\nfixedly at nothing, and that other trick of stopping suddenly in the\r\nmiddle of a sentence to cock his head, as if he were hearing some\r\nfar-away, uncertain sound.\r\n\r\n     MARGARET VANDEGRIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHING IN ELK RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a man has once absorbed into his system a love for fishing or\r\nhunting, he is under the influence of an invisible power greater than\r\nthat of vaccine matter or the virus of rabies. The sporting-fever is the\r\nveritable malady of St. Vitus, holding its victim forever on the go, as\r\ngame-seasons come, and so long as back and legs, eye and ear, can\r\nwrestle with Time's infirmities. It breeds ambition, boasting, and\r\n\"yarns\" to a proverbial extent, with a general disbelief in the possible\r\nveracity of a brother sportsman, and an irresistible; desire to talk of\r\nnew and privately discovered sporting-heavens. The gold-seeker stakes\r\nhis claim, the \"wild-catting\" oil-borer boards up his lot, the inventor\r\npatents his invention, and the author copyrights his brain-fruit; but\r\nthe sportsman crazily tells all he knows. So the secret gets out, and\r\nthe discoverer is robbed of his treasure and forced to seek new fields\r\nfor his rod and gun.\r\n\r\nColonel Bangem had enjoyed a year's sport among the unvisited preserves\r\nof Elk River. Mrs. Bangem and Bess, their daughter, had shared his\r\npleasures and acquired his fondness for such of them as were within\r\nfeminine reach. Any ordinary man would have been perfectly satisfied\r\nwith such company and delights; but no, when the bass began to leap and\r\nthe salmon to flash their tails, the pressure was too great. His friends\r\nthe Doctor and the Professor were written to, and summoned to his find.\r\nThey came, the secret was too good to keep, and that is the way this\r\nchronicle of their doings happens to be written.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the invitation received than the Doctor eased his\r\nconscience and delighted his patients by the regular professional\r\nsubterfuge of sending such of them as had money to the sea-shore, and\r\ntelling those who had not that they needed no medicine at present; the\r\nProfessor turned his classes over to an assistant on pretext of a sudden\r\nbronchial attack, for which a dose of mountain-air was the prescribed\r\nremedy. And so the two were whirled away on the Chesapeake and Ohio\r\nRailroad across the renowned valley of Virginia and the eastern valley\r\nsteps of the Alleghany summits, past the gigantic basins where boil and\r\nbubble springs curative of all human ills, down the wild boulder-tossed\r\nwaters and magnificent cañons of New River, around mountain-bases,\r\nthrough tunnels, and out into the broad, beautiful fertility of the\r\nKanawha Valley, until the spires of Charleston revealed the last stage\r\nof their railroad journey. When their train stopped, stalwart porters\r\nrelieved them of their baggage and deafened them with self-introductions\r\nin stentorian tones: \"Yere's your Hale House porter!\" \"I's de man fer\r\nSt. Albert's!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no wonder,\" said the Doctor, as he followed the sable guide from\r\nthe station to the river ferry, and looked across the Kanawha's busy\r\nflow, covered with coal-barges, steamboats, and lumber-crafts, to\r\nCharleston's long stretch of high-bank river front, \"that Western rivers\r\nget mad and rise against the deliberate insult of all the towns and\r\ncities turning their backs to them. There is a mile of open front,\r\nshowing the cheerful faces of fine residences through handsome\r\nshade-trees and over well-kept lawns; but here, where our ferry lands,\r\nand where we see the city proper, stoops and kitchens, stove-pipes and\r\nstairways, ash-piles and garbage-shoots, are stuck out in contempt of\r\nthe river's charms and the city's comeliness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stove-pipes and stairways have to be put somewhere,\" said the\r\nmatter-of-fact Professor. \"And the best way to turn dirty things is\r\ntoward the water.\"\r\n\r\nThe ferry-boat wheezed and coughed and sidled across the river to a\r\nfloating wharf, covered, as usual, with that portion of the population,\r\nwhite and black, which has no interest in the arrival of trains, or\r\nanything else, excepting meals at the time for them, but which manages\r\nto live somehow by looking at other people working.\r\n\r\n\"Give me,\" said the Professor, \"the value of the time which men spend in\r\ngazing at what does not concern them, and, according to my estimate, I\r\ncould build a submarine railroad from New York to Liverpool in two years\r\nand three months. What are those fellows doing with their huge barrels\r\non wheels backed into the river?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat is de Charleston water-works, boss,\" answered the grinning porter.\r\n\"Widout dem mules an' niggahs an' bar'ls dah wouldn't be 'nough water in\r\ndis town to wet a chaw tobacky.\"\r\n\r\nA winding macadamized road leads up the river bank to the main street\r\nrunning parallel with it. There is a short cut by a rickety stairway,\r\nbut, as some steep climbing has to be done before reaching the lower\r\nstep, it is seldom used. These formerly led directly to the Hale House,\r\na fine brick building, which faced the river, with a commodious portico,\r\nand offered the further attractions of a pleasant interior and an\r\nexcellent table; but now a blackened space marked its site, as though a\r\nhuge tooth had been drawn from the city's edge, for one morning a\r\nneighboring boiler blew up, carrying the Hale House and much valuable\r\nproperty with it, but leaving the owners of the boiler.\r\n\r\n\"Dat's where de Hale House was, boss, but it's done burned down. I's de\r\nporter yit. When it's done builded ag'in I's gwine back dar. Dis time I\r\ntake you down to de St. Albert. I's used to yellin' Hale House porter so\r\nmany years dat St. Albert kind chokes me.\"\r\n\r\nSo to the St. Albert went the Doctor and Professor, where they met with\r\na home-like greeting from its popular host.\r\n\r\nWheeling was formerly the capital of West Virginia, but for good reasons\r\nit was decided to move the seat of government from \"that knot on the\r\nPanhandle\" to Charleston. A commodious building of brick and sandstone,\r\nunchristened as to style of architecture, has been erected for the home\r\nof the law-makers; and henceforth the city which started around the\r\nlittle log fort built in 1786 by George Glendermon to afford protection\r\nagainst Indians will be the seat of government for the great unfenced\r\nState of West Virginia. Its business enterprise and thrift, its\r\nexcellent geographical and commercial position, its healthiness\r\nnotwithstanding its bad drainage, or rather no drainage, have induced a\r\ngrowth almost phenomenal. Churches, factories, and commodious\r\nstorehouses have spread the town rapidly over the beautiful valley in\r\nwhich it lies. The United States government has been lavish in its\r\nexpenditure upon a handsome building for court, custom, and post-office\r\npurposes; and to it flock, especially when court is in session, as\r\nmotley an assortment of our race as ever assembled at legal mandate.\r\nMoonshiners, and those who regard whiskey-making, selling, and drinking\r\nas things that ought to be as free as the air of the mountain and\r\nlicenses as unheard-of impositions of a highly oppressive government,\r\nthat would \"tax a feller for usin' up his own growin' uv corn,\" and\r\ncourts as \"havin' a powerful sight uv curiosity, peekin' into other\r\nfellers' business,\" afford ample opportunities for the exercise of\r\njudicial authority.\r\n\r\nA long mountaineer was before a dignified judge of the United States\r\nCourt for selling liquor without a license. He had bought a gallon at a\r\nstill,--as to the locality of which he professed profound\r\nignorance,--carried it thirty miles, and peddled it out to his\r\nlong-suffering and thirsty neighbors. Every native being a natural\r\ninformer, the story was soon told: arrest followed, a march of fifty\r\nmiles over the mountains, and a lengthy imprisonment before trial.\r\nFollowing the advice of his assigned counsel, he pleaded guilty. Being\r\ntoo poor to pay a fine, and having an unlimited family dependent upon\r\ntheir own exertions,--which comprises the sum of parental responsibility\r\namong the natives,--the judge released him on his own bail-bond, and\r\ntold him to go home. He deliberately put on his hat, walked up to his\r\nhonor, and said, \"I say, jedge, I reckon you fellers 'ill give me 'nough\r\nmoney to ride hum an' pay fer my grub, 'cause 'tain't fair, noway. You\r\nfetched me clar down yere, footin' it the hull way, an' now you're\r\nlettin' me off an' tellin' me to foot it back. 'Tain't fair, noway.\r\nYou-uns oughter pay me fer it.\" And he went off highly indignant at\r\nhaving his modest request refused.\r\n\r\nThere is much of the primitive not outgrown as yet by Charleston: it has\r\nput on a long-tailed coat over its round-about. The gossipy telephone\r\nis ahead of the street-cars; gas-works supply private consumers, while\r\nthe citizens wade the unlighted streets by the glimmer of their own\r\nlanterns; innumerable cows contest the right of pedestrians to the board\r\nfootways and what of pavement separates the mud-holes; an\r\nice-manufactory supplies coolness to water peddled about in barrels; the\r\nofficials outnumber the capacity of the jail; the ferry-facilities vary\r\nfrom an unstable leaky bateau to a dirty, open-decked dynamite\r\nsteamboat, whose night-service is subject to the lung-capacity of the\r\ntraveller hallooing for it, and the fares to necessities and\r\ncircumstances; the fine brick improvements are flanked by frame\r\ntinder-boxes; the offal of the city has not a single relieving sewer:\r\nyet it is a beautiful, healthy place, and the chief city of the greatest\r\nmineral-district in the world.\r\n\r\nOur travellers breakfasted on delicious mountain mutton and vegetables\r\nfresh from surrounding farms. Their host secured three men and a canoe\r\nto carry them up Elk River to Colonel Bangem's camp, at the cost of one\r\ndollar a day and \"grub,\" or one dollar and a quarter a day if they found\r\nthemselves, with the moderate charge of fifty cents a day for the canoe.\r\n\r\nWhen the time arrived for starting, the Professor was missing. Bells\r\nwere rung, servants were despatched to search the hotel for him, but he\r\nwas not to be found. The Doctor grew impatient, but restrained himself\r\nuntil an uncoated countryman, who had just walked into town and was\r\nready for a talk, told him that he \"seed a feller, thet wuz a stranger\r\nin these parts, with a three-legged picter-gallery, chasin' a water-cart\r\na right smart ways back in the town, ez I come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's he,\" said the Doctor. \"He is crazy after pictures. I'll give you\r\na dollar if you bring him to the hotel alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he wicked?\" asked the man.\r\n\r\n\"Generally,\" answered the Doctor, whose eyes began to twinkle; \"but you\r\nget hold of his picture-gallery and run for the hotel: he will follow\r\nyou. I often have to manage him that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm minded to try coaxin' him in thet a-way fer a dollar. You jist take\r\nkeer uv my shoes, an' I'll hev him yer ez quick ez Tim Price kin foot\r\nit, if he follers well an' hain't contrairy-like, holdin' back.\"\r\n\r\nTim Price relieved his feet of their encumbrances, and started. When his\r\ntall, gaunt figure had disappeared around the corner, the Doctor grew\r\nred in the face from an internal convulsion, and then exploded past all\r\nconcealment of his joke.\r\n\r\n\"If you gentlemen,\" he said to the by-standers, \"want to see some fun,\r\njust follow that man. I will stay here as judge whether the man brings\r\nin the Professor or the Professor brings in the man.\"\r\n\r\nA good joke would stop a funeral in Charleston. The hotel was cleared of\r\nmen in an instant to follow Tim and enjoy the hunt. Tim sighted the\r\nProfessor about a quarter of a mile back in the town, A darky driving a\r\nwater-cart was standing up on the shafts, thrashing his mule with the\r\nends of his driving-lines, and urging it, by voice and gesture, to the\r\nhighest mule-speed: \"Git up! git up! you lazy old no-go! Git up! Don't\r\nyou see dat picter-feller tryin' to took you an' me an' de bar'l? Git\r\nup! Wag yer ears an' switch yer tail. You're not gwine ter stan' still\r\nan' keep yer eyes on de instrement fer no gallery-man to took, 'less\r\nyou's fix' up fer Sunday. Git up, you ole long-eared corn-eater!\"\r\n\r\nThe Professor was keeping well up with the flying water-works. His hat\r\nwas stuck on the back of his head, he carried his camera with its tripod\r\nspread ready for sudden action, and every step of his run was guided by\r\nthoughts of proper distance, fixed focus, and determination to have the\r\nwater-works in his collection of instantaneous photographs. A turn in\r\nthe street gave the Professor his opportunity: he darted ahead, set his\r\ncamera, and took the whole show as it went galloping by, when he\r\nreclined against a fence while making the street ring with his laugh.\r\n\r\nTim Price, who was watching his chance, saw that it had come. He grabbed\r\nthe camera, gave a yell of triumph, and faced for the home-run. He had\r\nnot an instant to lose. The Professor sprang for his precious\r\ninstrument. Tim's long legs carried him across the street, over a fence\r\ninto a cross-cut lot, and away for the hotel at a mountaineer's speed.\r\nThe Professor was small, but active as a cat. Where Tim jumped fences,\r\nthe Professor squirmed through them; where Tim took one long stride, the\r\nProfessor scored three short ones. Tim lost his hat, and the Professor\r\nthrew off his coat as he ran. The main street was reached without\r\nperceptible decrease of distance between them; but there the pavements\r\nwere something Tim's bare feet were not used to catching on, and the\r\npeople something he was not used to dodging: he upset several, but\r\ndashed on, with his pursuer gaining on his heels. Men, women, dogs, and\r\ndarkies turned out to witness the race or follow it. \"Stop thief!\" \"Go\r\nit, Tim!\" \"You're catching him, stranger!\" \"Foot it, little one!\" were\r\ncries that speeded the running. The Doctor stood waiting at the hotel\r\ndoor, laughing, shaking, and red as a veritable Bacchus. Tim Price\r\nbanged the camera into him, whirled round suddenly, caught the Professor\r\nas he dashed at him, and held him in his powerful arms, squirming like\r\nan eel.\r\n\r\n\"Yere's your crazy man, stranger,\" said Tim, in slow, drawling tone. \"I\r\ntell you he kin jest p'intedly foot it. Thar hain't been such a run in\r\nKanoy County sence they stopped 'lectin' country fellers fer sheriff. I\r\nreckon I've arned thet dollar. What shall I do with the leetle feller?\"\r\n\r\nThe Professor was powerless, but lay in Tim's arms biting, kicking, and\r\ncurled up like a yellow-jacket interested with an enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Let him go,\" said the laughing Doctor. \"He will stay with me now. He is\r\nnot dangerous when I am about. Set him on his feet.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the Professor deposited on the pavement than he dealt Tim\r\na stinging blow which staggered him, and stood ready with trained\r\nmuscles set for defence.\r\n\r\n\"Look yere, leetle un,\" said Tim, coolly and with great self-restraint,\r\n\"'tain't fer the likes uv me to hit you, bein's you're a bit out in your\r\ntop, but I'll gin you another hug ef you do that ag'in; I will,\r\np'intedly.\"\r\n\r\nIn the good humor of the crowd, the mirth of the Doctor, and the\r\nlatter's possession of the camera the Professor scented a joke, and at\r\nonce saw his friend's hand in it. He joined in the laugh at his expense,\r\nand lengthened his friend's face by saying, \"The Doctor having had his\r\nfun, he will now pay the bill at the bar for all of you: he pays all my\r\nexpenses: so walk in, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nThe laws of hospitality west of the Alleghanies do not permit any one to\r\ndecline an invitation, so the Doctor settled for the whole procession\r\nand paid Tim Price his well-earned dollar.\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" said Tim to the hotel-proprietor, who had joined the crowd,\r\n\"ef two fellers comes here from the East, one uv 'em ez round ez a\r\npunkin an' red ez a flannel shirt an' bald ez a land-tortle, an' t'other\r\nez brown ez a mud-catty an' poor ez a razor-back hog, tell 'em I'm yere\r\nto pilot 'em up Elk to Colonel Bangem's caliker tents. He said they were\r\nez green ez frogs, an' didn't know nothin' noway, an' fer me to take\r\nkeer uv 'em. He don't reckon they'll come tell to-morrow. One uv 'em's a\r\nhoss-doctor, an' t'other's a perfessor uv religion, Colonel Bangem\r\ntelled me. I dunno whether the feller's a circuit-rider er a rale\r\npreacher.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the highly-illuminated pumpkin, my good man,\" said the\r\nProfessor, pointing to the Doctor, \"and I am Colonel Bangem's spiritual\r\nadviser. We got here a day sooner than we expected to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say? May I never! An' the colonel never telled me nothin'\r\nnohow 'bout any one uv you bein' crazy. Howdee? How do you like these\r\nparts? Right smart town we've got yere, hain't it? I'll take keer uv\r\nyou. There hain't no man on Elk River kin take keer uv you better nor\r\nTim Price, ary time. I hain't much up to moon men, though. Thar's one\r\nfeller up my way thet gits kinder skeery at the full uv the moon; but I\r\nhain't never tended him. I reckon I kin l'arn the job,--ez the ole boy\r\nsaid when his marm set him to mindin' fleas off the cat.\"\r\n\r\nTim Price was the hunter, boatman, fisherman, yarn-spinner, and\r\ncharacter of his region, and Colonel Bangem's faithful ally in all his\r\nsports: the latter had therefore sent him to meet his friends on their\r\narrival at Charleston, and he at once proceeded to take command of the\r\nwhole party as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n\"I footed it over the mountains, and sent my boat the river way. Hit\r\noughter be yere now: so we'll pack you men's tricks to the boats an'\r\np'int 'em up-stream. It 'ill be sundown afore we git thar.\"\r\n\r\nThe party started from the hotel, the procession followed to see them\r\noff, and they were soon down the Kanawha and into the mouth of Elk at\r\nthe point of the town. Log rafts, huge barges, miles of railroad-ties,\r\nlaid-up steamers, peddling-boats, with their highly-colored storehouses,\r\nfishermen's scows, floating homely cabins alive with bare-legged\r\nchildren and idlers of the water-side, push-boats loaded to the edge of\r\nthe narrow gunwales with merchandise for delivery to stores and dwellers\r\nfar up the river, boats loaded with hoop-poles, grist, chickens, and the\r\n\"home-plunder\" of some mover to civilization, coming down the river from\r\nthe mountain-clearing, and samples of every conceivable kind of the\r\nriver's outpour, were tied to the banks or lazily floating on the\r\ncurrentless back-water from the Kanawha.\r\n\r\nAn old steamboat-captain once said of Elk that \"it was the all-firedest\r\nriver God ever made,--fer it rises at both ends and runs both ways to\r\nwunst.\" This is true, and is caused by the Kanawha, when rising, pouring\r\nits water into the mouth of Elk and reversing its current for many\r\nmiles, while at the same time rain falls in the mountains, increasing\r\nthe latter river's depth and velocity. Flour-mills, iron-foundries,\r\nsaw-mills, woollen-mills, and barrel-factories extend their long wooden\r\nslides down to the river's edge, to gather material for their\r\nconsumption. A railroad spans it with an iron trussed bridge, and the\r\ndemands of wagon and foot-travel are met by an airy one suspended by\r\ncables from tower-like abutments on either side, both bridges swung high\r\nin the air, out of reach of flood and of the smoke-stacks of passing\r\nsteam-craft.\r\n\r\nA mile from the river's mouth, and just beyond the limits of Charleston,\r\nis one of the finest sandstone-quarries in the world. The United States\r\ngovernment monopolizes most of its product in the construction of the\r\nmagnificent lock and shifting dams in course of erection on the Kanawha\r\nto facilitate the transportation of coal from the immense deposits now\r\nbeing mined to the great markets of the Ohio River. A little farther on,\r\nthe brown front of a timber dam and cribbed lock looks down upon a wild\r\nswirl and rush of water; for through a cut gap in its centre Elk flows\r\nunobstructed,--a penniless mob having made the opening one night that\r\ntheir canoes might pass free and capitalists be encouraged to remove\r\nsuch worthless stuff as money from the growing industries of the river.\r\nPrior to this act of vandalism the water was backed by the dam for a\r\ndistance of fourteen miles, to Jarrett's Ford, making a halting-place\r\nfor rafts and logs, barges and floats, coming down from the vast forests\r\nabove when rains and snow-thaws raised the river and its tributaries;\r\nbut now a long stretch of boom catches what it can of Elk's commerce and\r\nis a chartered parasite upon it.\r\n\r\nHere at the old dam the mountains close in tightly upon the narrow\r\nvalley. Log cabins and a few simple frame houses nestle upon diminutive\r\nfarms; the wild beauty of shoal and eddy, bouldered channel and\r\nlake-like stretches of pool, rocky walls and timber-clad peaks, begins\r\nto charm the stranger and draw him on and on through scenery as\r\nattractive as grand toss of mountains and delve of river can make it.\r\n\r\nBy dint of poling, pushing, rowing, and pulling, the boats were worked\r\nover rapids and pools for almost a score of miles, to where the last\r\nrays of the sun slid over a mountain-point and hit Colonel Bangem's hat\r\nas it spun in the air by way of welcome, while the prows clove the water\r\nof a lovely eddy lying in front of his camp. The meeting was that of old\r\nfriends, with the addition of a blush from Bess Bangem and its bright\r\nreflection from the Professor's face.\r\n\r\nTim Price took the colonel to one side mysteriously, and whispered, \"I\r\ntook keer uv the Perfessor my own self: he guv me a power uv trouble,\r\nthough. Shell I hitch him now, er let him run loose?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll turn him loose now, Tim; but if he takes to turning somersets,\r\ncatch him, loosen his collar, take off his boots, and throw him into the\r\nriver,\" was the colonel's sober reply.\r\n\r\nScientists nowadays set up Energy as the ancestor of everything, measure\r\nthe value of its descendants by the quantity they possess of the family\r\ntrait, and spend their time in showing how to utilize it for the good of\r\nmankind in general. Professor Yarren was an apostle of Energy: it\r\nabsorbed him, filled him. From the weight of the sun to boiled potatoes,\r\nfrom the spring of a tiger to the jump of a flea, from the might of\r\nchemical disembodiment to opening an oyster, he calculated, advised, and\r\ndilated upon it. He himself, was the epitome of Energy: in his size he\r\neconomized space, in his diet he ate for power, not quantity. To him\r\neating and sleeping were Energy's warehousemen; idleness was dry-rot,\r\nmoth, and mildew; laughing, talking, whistling, singing, somersets, and\r\nfishing, never-to-be-neglected and in-constant-use safety-valves. He\r\nregarded himself as an assimilator of everything that went into him, be\r\nit food, sight, sound, or scent, and his perfection as such in exact\r\nratio to the product he derived from them. So when next morning he said\r\n\"Come on\" to the Doctor, and Colonel Bangem, Mrs. Colonel Bangem, Bess\r\nBangem, and Martha, the mountain-maid, who were all standing in front of\r\nthe camp rigged for a day's fishing, he meant that one of Energy's\r\nsafety-valves was ready to blow off, and that further delay might be\r\ndangerous to him.\r\n\r\nIn the Doctor, Energy was stored in bond as it were, subject to duties,\r\nand only to be issued on certificate that it was wanted for use and\r\neverything ready for it: therefore at the Professor's \"Come on\" he\r\ncalmly sat down on a log, filled his pipe, leisurely lighted it, and\r\ngood-humoredly remarked, \"I am confident that one-half of what we call\r\nlife is spent in undoing what we have done, in lamenting the lack of\r\nwhat we have forgotten, or going back after it: therefore I make it a\r\nrule when everything seems ready for a start--especially when going\r\nfishing--to sit five minutes in calm communion with my pipe, thinking\r\nmatters over. It insures against much discomfort from treacherous\r\nmemories and neglect.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Doctor whiffed at his pipe, he inventoried guns, tackle, lunch,\r\nhammocks, air-cushions, gigs, frog-spears, and all other necessaries for\r\na day's sport on the river. The result was as he had prophesied,--many\r\nthings had been omitted. \"Now,\" said he, when the five minutes were up,\r\n\"we might venture down the bank, which, rest assured, each member of\r\nthis party will have to climb up again after something left behind.\"\r\n\r\nA motley little fleet awaited the party at the water's\r\nedge,--square-ended, flat-bottomed punts, sharp-bowed bateaux, long,\r\ngraceful, dug-out canoes, and a commodious push-boat, with cabin and\r\nawning, whose motive power was poles. Elk River craft are as abundant as\r\nthe log cabins on its banks, and their pilots are as numerous as the\r\ninhabitants. Neither sex nor size is a disqualification, for, excepting\r\nthe trifling matter of being web-toed, all are provided from birth with\r\nwater-going properties, and, be it seed-time or harvest, the river has\r\nthe first claim upon them for all its varied sports and occupations. A\r\nshot at mallard, black-head, butter-duck, loon, wild goose, or\r\nblue-winged teal, as they follow the river's winds northward in the\r\nspring-time, will stop the ploughs furrowing its fertile bottoms as far\r\nas its echoes roll around mountain-juts, and cause the hands that held\r\nthe lines to grasp old-fashioned rifles for a chance at the winged\r\npassers. When, later, woodcock seek its margins, gray snipe, kill-deer,\r\nmud-hens, and plovers its narrow fens, the scythe will rest in the\r\nhalf-mown field while its wielder \"takes a crack at 'em.\" And when\r\nautumn brings thousands of gray squirrels, flocks of wild pigeon and\r\nwater-fowl, to feed on its mast, no household obligation or out-door\r\nprofit will keep the natives from shooting, morning, noon, and night.\r\n\r\nSome day in the near future a railroad will be built \"up Elk,\" and then,\r\nwhile commerce and civilization will get a lift, the loveliest of rivers\r\nwill be scarred; her trout-streams, carp-runs, bass-pools,\r\nsalmon-swirls, deer-licks, bear-dens, partridge-nestles, and\r\npheasant-covers will be overrun by sports-men, her magnificent mountains\r\nwill be scratched bald-headed by lumbermen, her laughing tributaries\r\nwill be saddened with saw-dust, and her queer, quaint, original\r\nboat-pullers and \"seng-diggers\" will wear shoes in summer-time and coats\r\nin winter, weather-board their log cabins, put glass in the windows and\r\npartitions across the one room inside. Woods-meetings will creep into\r\nchurches, square sousing in the river will degenerate to the gentle\r\nbaptismal sprinkle; no picnics or barbecues will delight the inhabitants\r\nwith flying horses and fights, open fireplaces and sparking-benches will\r\ngive way to stoves and chairs, riding double on horseback, with fair\r\narms not afraid to hold tight against all dangers real or fancied, will\r\nbe a joy of the past, \"bean-stringin's,\" \"apple-parin's,\"\r\n\"punkin-clippin's,\" \"sass-bilin's,\" \"sugar-camps,\" \"cabin-raisin's,\"\r\n\"log-rollin's,\" \"bluin's,\" \"tar-and-feathering,\" and \"hangin's,\" will be\r\nout-civilized, and the whole country will be spoiled.\r\n\r\n\"It looks like a good biting morning for bass,\" said Colonel Bangem,\r\nwhile he was distributing the party properly among the boats. \"But, in\r\nspite of all signs, bass bite when they please. It is a sunny morning:\r\nso use bright spoon-trolls, medium size. If the fish rise freely,\r\ntwenty-five feet of line is enough to have out on the stern lines; and,\r\nas the ladies will use the poles, ten feet of line is enough for them.\r\nDon't forget, Mrs. Bangem, to keep your troll spinning just outside the\r\nswirl of the oar, and as near the surface of the water as possible. You\r\nknow you _will_ talk and forget all about it. Now we will start. If we\r\nget separated and it grows cloudy, change your trolls for three-inch\r\n'fairy minnows;' and if the wind ripples the water, let out from sixty\r\nto eighty feet of line. Take the centre of the river, and you will haul\r\nin salmon; for bass will not rise to a troll in the eddies when the\r\nwater is rough. Salmon will. Tim, take the lead with the Professor, that\r\nthe other men may see your stroke and course. In trolling, the oarsman\r\nhas as much to do with the success as the fisherman.\"\r\n\r\nOff they went, three to a boat, the fishers seated in bow and stern, the\r\nladies in front with their fishing-poles, and the oarsman in his proper\r\nplace, rowing a slow, steady stroke, dipping true and silently just\r\nfifty feet from bank, or sedge, or shelf of rock, steering outside of\r\nsnags and drift and where overhanging trees buried their shadows in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe boats had hardly reached their positions--two on each side of the\r\nstream--when a shout from the Professor announced a catch, as hand over\r\nhand he cautiously drew in the swerving line or held it taut, as the\r\ndiving fish sought the rocky bottom or the friendly refuge of a log\r\ndrift. With unvarying stroke Tim kept his boat in deep water, away from\r\nentangling dangers. There was a flash in the air and a jingle of the\r\ntroll, as a fine bass shot out of the water to shake the barbs from his\r\nopen mouth; but the hooks held firm, and the taut line foiled the effort\r\nto dislodge them. Down came the fish with a splash, to dart for the\r\nboat at lightning speed and leap again for life; but this time no jingle\r\nof troll announced his game. He leaped ahead to fall upon the line and\r\nthus tear the hooks from their hold. Successful fishing depends upon two\r\nthings,--the presence of fish and knowing more than fish do. At the\r\ninstant of the fish's leap the Professor slackened his line: down came\r\nthe bass on a limber loop, defeated in his strategy and wearied by his\r\neffort, to be hauled quickly to the boat's side and landed, wriggling\r\nand tossing, at Tim Price's feet.\r\n\r\n\"You've cotched bass afore, Perfesser. You ez up to their ways ez a\r\nmus'rat to a mussel, er a kingfisher to a minner,\" exclaimed Tim\r\nadmiringly, as he loosened the troll from a two-pound bass. \"Hit's\r\np'intedly a pity you're out uv your head 'bout picters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have one! I have one!--a fish! What kind is it?\" screamed Bess\r\nBangem, who was the Professor's companion, as her light trout-pole bent\r\nfrom a sudden tug, and the reel whirred as the line ran off.\r\n\r\n\"Stop him, hold on to him, wind him in, and I will tell you,\" answered\r\nthe Professor, laughing.\r\n\r\nBess was a practised hand, and loved the sport; but, woman-like, she\r\nalways paused to wonder what she had caught before proceeding to find\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"It will be the subject of a lecture for you, whatever it is,\" replied\r\nBess, with a saucy shake of her head, as she wound in the line and\r\nguided the playing fish with well-managed pole. Her fine face flushed\r\nwith the excitement of the run and leap of her prey, as it came nearer\r\nand nearer, until Tim slipped the landing-net quietly under it and\r\nlanded a beauty in the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow! I wonder if I hurt him?\" said Bess.\r\n\r\n\"Not much, if any,\" remarked the Professor. \"I never was a fish, and\r\nconsequently never was foolish enough to jump at a bunch of hooks; but,\r\nas the cartilage of a fish's mouth is almost nerveless, there is but\r\nlittle pain from a hook diet. Bass, salmon, pike, and other gamey fish\r\nwill often keep on biting after they have been badly hooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"So will men,\" said Bess, as she threw her troll into the water to do\r\nfresh duty.\r\n\r\n\"You're p'intedly keerect,\" said Tim Price. \"I got the sack four times,\r\nan' hed right smart mittens, afore I cotched a stayin' holt on my old\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\nShout after shout waked the mountain-echoes, as fish were held up in\r\ntriumph, and as the boats glided over the smooth water of the eddy.\r\nAhead was a mass of foam and a long dash of water down a shoal.\r\n\r\n\"Yere's where me and the colonel catches 'em lively when I pull him,\"\r\nsaid Martha to the Doctor. \"They bite yere ez lively ez a stray pig in a\r\ntater-patch. Whoop! I've got him! He pulls like a mule at a\r\nhitchin'-rope. Keep your boat head to the current, Alec, an' pull hard,\r\ner we'll drift down on him an' I'll lose him. Whoop! May I never! A\r\nfive-pounder! I'll slit him down the back an' brile him fer breakfast.\r\nWhoop! In you come!\"\r\n\r\nThe boatmen pulled hard against the fierce current at the foot of the\r\nshoal, crossed and recrossed, circled, and at it again, until a score or\r\nmore of noble bass were hooked from the swirl, and Colonel Bangem led\r\nthe way up the rapids. Then the oarsmen leaped into the water and towed\r\nthe boats through the wild current, until the eddy at the top of it\r\nallowed them to take oars again.\r\n\r\n\"Preacher, kin you paddle?\" asked Tim Price of the Professor, as he\r\ndrained the water from his legs before getting into the boat. \"Ef you\r\nair a hand at it, take an oar an' paddle a bit astern: there'll be white\r\npeerch an' red-hoss lyin' yere at the head uv the shore.\"\r\n\r\nThe Professor took an oar and paddled, while Tim Price poised himself in\r\nthe boat, spear in hand and the long rope from its slender shaft coiled\r\nat his feet. He peered intently into the water as the boat moved slowly\r\nalong. Presently every muscle of him was set: he bent backward for a\r\ncast, pointed his spear with steady hands to a spot in the river, and\r\nquick as a flash it pierced the water until its ten-foot shaft was seen\r\nno more. As quickly was it recovered by Tim's active hands catching the\r\nflying line to haul it in; and on its prongs squirmed a monstrous fish\r\nof the sucker tribe,--a red-horse,--pinned through and through by his\r\nunerring aim.\r\n\r\nShoal and eddy, swirl and silent pool, yielded good sport and harvest,\r\nas haunts of bass and salmon were entered and passed, until the inviting\r\nmouth of Little Sandy Creek suggested rest for the boatmen and a stroll\r\nfor the fishers. A neat hotel, clean and well kept for so wild a region,\r\nharbors lumbermen, rivermen, and those who love the rod and gun. There\r\nare many such attractive centres along the banks of Elk, with charming\r\ncamping-grounds, where neighboring hospitality abounds, and chickens,\r\neggs, milk, corn, and bacon are abundant and cheap, and the finest\r\nbass-and other fishing possible, from Queen's Shoal--four miles away--to\r\nthe old dam above Charleston. Above Queen's Shoal the region increases\r\nin wildness and attractiveness for traveller or sportsman. Trout in\r\nplenty find homes in the mountain-tributaries of Upper Elk; deer abound,\r\nand all manner of smaller game. Where nature does her best work, man is\r\napt to do but little. Nature farms the Elk country.\r\n\r\nBright moonlight, the early morning after the sun is up, and from a\r\ncouple of hours after mid-day until the mountain-shadows strike the\r\nwater in the evening, are the best times to troll for bass. If so\r\nminded, they will rise to a fly at such times in the rapids; but no\r\nallurement excepting the troll will bring them to the surface in still\r\nwater. When the river is rising, or the water is clouded with mud or\r\ndrift, bass scorn all surface-diet; but the live minnow or crawfish,\r\nhellgramite or fish-worm, will capture them on trout-line or hook\r\nattached to the soul-absorbing bob. A clothes-line wire cable, furnished\r\nwith well-assorted hooks baited with cotton, dough, and cheese well\r\nmixed together, and stretched in eddy-water when the river is muddy,\r\nwill give fine reward in carp, white perch, catfish, turtles, garfish,\r\nand sweet revenge on the bait-stealing guana.\r\n\r\nAfter nooning, lunch, and a quiet loaf, the party sped homeward with the\r\ncurrent, handling rods and trolls as salmon and bass demanded lively\r\nattention. Shooting a rapid, and out into a deep pool at its foot, the\r\nDoctor's boat struck a snag, and he, having a resisting power equal to\r\nthat of a billiard-ball, put his heels where his head had been, and\r\ndisappeared under the water, to pop up again instantly, sputtering and\r\nspitting, like a jug full of yeast with a corn-cob stopper.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hickey! Whoop!\" exclaimed Martha, as she went off in wild screams\r\nof laughter. \"Kin you swim?\" she asked, with the coolness of the\r\nmountain-maiden she was.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" sputtered the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon you'll tow good. Jest gimme your han', an' keep your feet\r\ndown, an' me an' Alec 'ill tow you ashore to dreen. Hit's like you're\r\npurty wet.\"\r\n\r\nHe was soon landed by the stalwart Martha and Alec, and, while he\r\nattitudinized for draining, the Professor amused himself with taking an\r\ninstantaneous photograph.\r\n\r\n\"By gum! he mought hev drownded,\" said Tim Price to the Professor. \"The\r\nDoctor hain't a good shape fer towin', but he floats higher than any\r\ncraft of his length I ever seed on Elk River.\"\r\n\r\nJust as the golden light of evening cast its sheen upon the river the\r\ncamp-tents came in sight, where a group of natives stood waiting the\r\narrival of the fishers to \"hear what luck they'd hed.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Bangem and Bess carried off equal honors in greatest\r\ncount,--sixty-two bass and five salmon each. Martha, with her\r\nfive-pounder, was weight champion. Mrs. Bangem had the only blue pike.\r\nThe Professor claimed that, besides his twoscore fish, he had\r\nillustrations enough for a comic annual; and the Doctor asserted that he\r\nknew more about bass than any of them, for he had been down where they\r\nlived, and was of the opinion that he had swallowed a couple.\r\n\r\nBess Bangem said to the Professor, as they went up the bank together, \"I\r\nhad a great mind to count you in with my fish, to beat father; but I\r\ncaught you long ago, so it would not have been fair.\"\r\n\r\n     TOBE HODGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON A NOBLE CHARACTER MARRED BY LITTLENESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Moscow's splendors trench on narrow lanes,\r\n  The wonder, brimming every traveller's eyes,\r\nTo disappointment's sudden darkness wanes\r\n  At finding meanness near such grandeur lies.\r\n\r\nO human city! built on Moscow's plan,\r\n  Thy great and little touch each other so,\r\nLet me forbear, and, as an erring man,\r\n  Make my approaches wisely, from below,\r\n\r\nHasting through all the narrow and the base\r\n  Before I stand where all is high and vast:\r\nAfter the dark, let glory light my face,\r\n  Thy shining greatness break upon me _last_.\r\n\r\n     CHARLOTTE FISKE BATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTTISH CROFTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to dispel the halo which poetry and romance have thrown about\r\nthe Scottish Highlander and see him simply as he appears in every-day\r\nlife. And indeed, all fiction aside, there is in his history and\r\ncharacter much that is most admirable and noble. On many a terrible\r\nbattle-field his courage has been unsurpassed. His brave and tireless\r\nstruggle for existence where both climate and soil are unfriendly is\r\nequally worthy of respect. Then, too, his sterling honesty and\r\nindependence in speech and action and his high moral and religious\r\nqualities combine to make him a valuable citizen.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations account in part for the interest which has been\r\nexcited in England by the claims of the Scottish crofters. There are,\r\nhowever, other reasons why so much attention has of late been given to\r\ntheir complaints. Their poverty and hardships have long been known in\r\nEngland. The reports made by the Emigration Commissioners in 1841 and by\r\nSir John McNeil a few years later contain accounts of miserably small\r\nand unproductive holdings, of wretched hovels for dwellings, of lack of\r\nenterprise and interest in making improvements, of curtailment of\r\npasture, of high rents and insecurity of tenure, very similar to those\r\nfound on the pages of the report of the late Royal Commission. While in\r\nthis interval the condition of the crofters has but slightly, if at all,\r\nimproved, there has been a very considerable improvement in the\r\ncondition of the middle and lower classes of the people in other parts\r\nof Scotland and in England. The masses of the people have better houses,\r\nbetter food and clothing, while with the development of the school\r\nsystem and the newspaper press general intelligence has greatly\r\nincreased. The accounts of the poverty and wretchedness of the crofters\r\nnow reach the public much more quickly and make a much deeper impression\r\non all classes than they did forty years ago. While these small farmers\r\nare not numerous,--there are probably not more than four thousand\r\nfamilies in need of relief,--many of their kinsmen elsewhere have\r\nacquired wealth and influence and have been able to plead their cause\r\nwith good effect. In this country \"The Scottish Land League\" has issued\r\nin \"The Cry of the Crofter\" an eloquent plea for help to carry on the\r\nagitation to a successful issue.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the increased attention that has lately been given to\r\nthese claims is found in the rapidly-growing tendency to concede to the\r\nlandlord fewer and fewer and to the tenant more and more rights in the\r\nland. The recent extension of the suffrage, giving votes to nearly two\r\nmillions of agricultural and other laborers, leads politicians to go as\r\nfar as possible in favoring new legislation in the interest of tenants\r\nand laborers. The crofters' case has therefore come to be of special\r\ninterest as a part of the general land question which has of late\r\nreceived so much attention from the English press and Parliament, and\r\nwhich is pretty certain to be prominent for several years to come.\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar only with the relations existing between landlord\r\nand tenant in this country are naturally surprised to find the crofter\r\ndemanding that his landlord shall (1) give him the use of more land,\r\n(2) reduce his rent, (3) pay him on leaving his holding for all his\r\nimprovements, and (4) not accept in his stead another tenant, even\r\nthough the latter may be anxious to take the holding at a higher figure\r\nor turn him out for any other reason. In addition to all this, the\r\ncrofters demand that the government shall advance them money to enable\r\nthem to build suitable houses and improve and stock their farms. An\r\nAmerican tenant who should make such demands would be considered insane.\r\nNo such view of the crofters' claims, however, is taken in England and\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the grounds upon which these extensive claims are based?\r\nWhy should the crofter claim a right to have his holding enlarged and to\r\nhave the land at a lower rent than some one else may be willing to pay?\r\nThe reasons are to be found partly in his history, traditions, and\r\ncircumstances, and partly in the present tendency of the legislation and\r\ndiscussions relating to the ownership and occupation of land.\r\n\r\nUnder the old clan system, to which the crofter is accustomed to trace\r\nhis claims, the land was owned by the chief and clansmen in common, and\r\nallotments and reallotments were made from time to time to individual\r\nclansmen, each of whom had a right to some portion of the land, while\r\nthe commons were very extensive. Rent or service was paid to the chief,\r\nwho had more or less control over the clan lands and often possessed an\r\nestate in severalty, with many personal dependants. In many cases the\r\npower of the chief was great and tyrannical, and many of the clansmen\r\nwere in a somewhat servile condition; but the more influential clansmen\r\nseem sometimes to have retained permanent possession of their\r\nallotments. Long ago sub-letting became common, and hard services were\r\noften exacted of the sub-tenants, whose lot was frequently a most\r\nunhappy one. The modern cottar, as well as the squatter, had his\r\nrepresentative in the dependant of the chief, or clansman, or in the\r\noutlaw or vagrant member of another clan who came to build his rude\r\ncabin wherever he could find a sheltered and unoccupied spot. No doubt\r\nmany of the sub-tenants, even where they held originally by base and\r\nuncertain services and at the will of their superior, came in time, like\r\nthe English copyholder, to have a generally-recognized right to the\r\npermanent possession of their holdings, while custom tended to fix the\r\ncharacter and quantity of their services. The population was not\r\nnumerous, and it was probably not difficult for every man to secure a\r\nplot of land of some sort.\r\n\r\nThe crofters of to-day have lost for the most part the traditions of the\r\ndrawbacks and hardships of this ancient system, with its oppressive\r\nservices, to which many of their ancestors were subject, and have\r\ncommonly retained only the tradition of the right which every clansman\r\nhad to some portion of the clan lands. In 1745 the clan organizations\r\nwere abolished and the chiefs transformed into landlords and invested\r\nwith the fee-simple of the land. But, while changes were gradually made\r\non some estates in the direction of conformity to the English system,\r\nmost of the old customary rights of the people continued to be\r\nrecognized. The tenant was commonly allowed to occupy his holding from\r\nyear to year without interruption. Money rent gradually took the place\r\nof service or rent in kind, but the amount exacted does not seem to have\r\nbeen often increased arbitrarily. The rights of common, which were often\r\nof great value, were respected.\r\n\r\nThe descendants and successors, however, of the old Scotch lairds did\r\nnot always display the same regard for prescriptive rights and usages.\r\nIn some cases the extravagance and bankruptcy of the old owners caused\r\nthe titles to pass to Englishmen, while in others the inheritors of the\r\nestates were more and more inclined to insist upon their legal rights\r\nand to introduce in the management of their property rules similar to\r\nthose in use in England. Early in the present century sheep-farming was\r\nfound to be profitable, and many large areas of glen and mountain were\r\ncleared of the greater part of their population and converted into\r\nsheep-farms. Many of the mountainous parts of Scotland are of little use\r\nfor agricultural purposes. Formerly the crofters used large tracts as\r\nsummer pastures for their small herds of inferior stock. By and by the\r\nproprietors found that large droves of better breeds of sheep could be\r\nkept on these mountain-pastures. The crofters were too poor to undertake\r\nthe management of the large sheep-farms into which it was apparently\r\nmost profitable to divide these mountain-lands, and sheep-farmers from\r\nthe south became the tenants. By introducing sheep-farming on a large\r\nscale the landlords were able, they claimed, to use hundreds of\r\nthousands of acres which before were of comparatively little value. The\r\nlarge flocks of sheep could not, however, be kept without having the\r\nlower slopes of the mountains on which to winter. It was these slopes\r\nthat the crofters commonly used for pasture, below which, in the straths\r\nand glens, were their holdings and dwellings. The ruins of cottages, or\r\npatches of green here and there where cottages stood, mark the sites of\r\nmany little holdings from which the crofters and their families were\r\nturned out many years ago in order to make room for sheep-farms. The\r\nproprietors sometimes recognized the rights of these native tenants, and\r\ngave them new holdings in exchange for the old ones. The new crofts were\r\noften nearer the sea, where the land was less favorable for grazing and\r\nwhere the rights of common were less valuable, but the occupants had\r\nbetter opportunities for supplementing their incomes from the land by\r\nfishing and by gathering sea-weed for kelp, from which iodine was made.\r\nThere were, however, great numbers who were not supplied with new\r\ncrofts, but turned away from their old homes and left to shift for\r\nthemselves. Some of these, too poor to go elsewhere, built rude huts\r\nwherever they could find a convenient spot, and thus increased the ranks\r\nof the squatters. Others were allowed to share the already too small\r\nholdings of their more fortunate brethren, while others, again, found\r\ntheir way to the lowlands and cities of the south or to America. The\r\ntraditions of the hardships and sufferings endured by some of these\r\nevicted crofters are still kept alive in the prosperous homes of their\r\nchildren and grandchildren on this side of the Atlantic. The process of\r\nclearing off the crofters went on for many years. In 1849 Hugh Miller,\r\nin trying to arouse public sentiment against it, declared that, \"while\r\nthe law is banishing its tens for terms of seven and fourteen\r\nyears,--the penalty of deep-dyed crimes,--irresponsible and infatuated\r\npower is banishing its thousands for no crime whatever.\"\r\n\r\nLately, owing to foreign competition and the deterioration of the land\r\nthat has been used for many years as sheep-pastures, sheep-farming has\r\nbecome much less profitable than formerly, and many large tenants have\r\nin consequence given up their farms. The enthusiasm for deer-hunting\r\nhas, however, increased with the increase of wealth and leisure among\r\nEnglishmen, and immense tracts, amounting altogether to nearly two\r\nmillions of acres, have been turned into deer-forests, yielding, as a\r\nrule, a slightly higher rent than was paid by the crofters and\r\nsheep-farmers. Much of this land is either unfit for agricultural\r\npurposes or could not at present be cultivated with profit. Some of it,\r\nhowever, is fertile, or well suited for grazing, and greatly coveted by\r\nthe crofters. The deer and other game often destroy or injure the crops\r\nof the adjoining holdings, and thus add to the troubles of the occupants\r\nand increase their indignation at the land's being used to raise sheep\r\nand \"vermin\" instead of men. Most Americans have had intimations of this\r\nfeeling through the accounts of the hostility that has been shown to our\r\ncountryman, Mr. Winans, whose deer-forest is said to cover two hundred\r\nsquare miles. While evictions are much less common than they were two or\r\nthree generations ago, there has all along been a disposition on the\r\npart of the proprietors to enclose in their sheep-farms and deer-forests\r\nlands that were formerly tilled or used as commons by the crofters and\r\ncottars. In comparison with the crofter of to-day the sub-tenant of a\r\nhundred years ago had, as a rule, more land for tillage, a far wider\r\nrange of pasture for his stock, and \"greater freedom in regard to the\r\nnatural produce of the river and moor.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the crofters belong to families which have lived on the same\r\nholdings for generations. It is a common experience everywhere that\r\nlong-continued use begets and fosters the feeling of ownership. This is\r\nespecially true when, as in the crofter's case, there is so much in the\r\nhistory and traditions of the people and the property that tends to\r\nestablish a right of possession. Besides, the crofter, or one of his\r\nancestors, has in most cases built the house and made other\r\nimprovements: sometimes he has reclaimed the land itself and changed a\r\nbarren waste into a garden. The labor and money which he and his\r\nancestors have expended in improving the place seem to him to give him\r\nan additional right to occupy it always. It is his holding and his home,\r\nthe home of his fathers and of his family. While he may be unable to\r\nresist the power of his landlord, and may have no legal security for his\r\nrights and interests, he regards the curtailment of his privileges or\r\nthe increase of his rent as unjust, and eviction as a terrible outrage.\r\n\"The extermination of the Highlanders,\" says one of their kinsmen, \"has\r\nbeen carried on for many years as systematically and persistently as\r\nthat of the North-American Indians.... Who can withhold sympathy as\r\nwhole families have turned to take a last look at the heavens red with\r\ntheir burning homes? The poor people shed no tears, for there was in\r\ntheir hearts that which stifled such signs of emotion: they were\r\nabsorbed in despair. They were forced away from that which was dear to\r\ntheir hearts, and their patriotism was treated with contemptuous\r\nmockery.... There are various ways in which the crime of murder is\r\nperpetrated. There are killings which are effected by the unjust and\r\ncruel denying of lands to our fellow-creatures to enable them to obtain\r\nfood and raiment.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the crofters in regard to increase of rent and eviction\r\nis very similar to that of the Irish tenantry. Very recently Mr. Parnell\r\nuttered sentiments which both would accept as their own. \"I trust,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that when any individual feels disposed to violate the divine\r\ncommandment by taking, under such circumstances, that which does not\r\nbelong to him, he will feel within him the promptings of patriotism and\r\nreligion, and that he will turn away from the temptation. Let him\r\nremember that he is doing a great injustice to his country and his\r\nclass,--that though he may perhaps benefit materially for a while, yet\r\nthat ill-gotten gains will not prosper.\" Where crofters have been\r\nevicted, or have had their privileges curtailed or their rent raised,\r\nthey and their descendants do not soon forget the grievance. Claims have\r\nrecently been made for lands which the crofters have not occupied for\r\ntwo or three generations.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch landlords are not, as a rule, cruel or unjust. On the\r\ncontrary, some of them are exceedingly kind and generous to their\r\ntenants, and have spent large sums of money in making improvements which\r\nadd greatly to the prosperity and comfort of those who live on their\r\nestates. Many of them recognize the right of their tenants to occupy\r\ntheir holdings without interruption so long as the rent is paid\r\nregularly. The natural tendency, however, to insist upon their legal\r\nrights and to make the most they can out of their estates has led to not\r\na few cases of hardship and injustice. A few such instances in a\r\ncommunity are talked over for years, and often seriously interfere with\r\nthe contentment and industry of many families. The traditions and\r\nrecollections of the many evictions which have occurred during this\r\ncentury have often caused the motives of the best landlords to be\r\nsuspected and their most benevolent acts to be misunderstood by their\r\ntenants. The crofter system has been an extremely bad one in many\r\nrespects. There cannot be much interest in making improvements where the\r\ntenant must build the houses, fences, stables, etc., but has no\r\nguarantee that he will not be turned out of his holding or have his rent\r\nso increased as practically to compel him to leave the place. The\r\nkindness and humanity of the landlords have in many instances mitigated\r\nthe worst evils of the system; but, while human nature remains as it is,\r\nno matter how just and generous individual landlords may be, general\r\nprosperity and contentment are impossible under the present\r\narrangements. The discontent and discouragement caused by the action of\r\nthe less kind and considerate landlords and agents frequently extend to\r\ncrofters who have no just grounds of complaint, and troubles and\r\nhardships resulting from idleness or improvidence or other causes are\r\noften attributed to the injustice of the laws or the cruelty of the\r\nlandlords.\r\n\r\nThe poverty of the crofter often renders his condition deplorable. His\r\nholding and right of common have been curtailed by the landlord, or he\r\nhas sub-divided them among his sons or kinsmen, until it would be\r\nimpossible for the produce of the soil to sustain the population, even\r\nif no rent whatever were charged. Some years ago he was able to increase\r\nhis income by gathering sea-weed for kelp; but latterly, since iodine\r\ncan be obtained more cheaply from other sources, the demand for this\r\nproduct has ceased. In some places the fishing is valuable, enabling him\r\nto supply his family with food for a part of the year, and bringing him\r\nmoney besides. He is, however, often too poor to provide the necessary\r\nboats and nets, while in many places the absence of good harbors and\r\nlandings is a most serious drawback to the fishing industry. Sometimes\r\nhe supplements his income by spending a few months of the year in the\r\nlow country and obtaining work there. In most cases, however, a large\r\npart of his income must be derived from the land. If there were plenty\r\nof employment to be had, the little holding would do very well as a\r\ngarden, and the stock which he could keep on the common would add\r\ngreatly to his comfort. As things now are, he must look chiefly to the\r\nland both for his subsistence and his rent, and, with an unfruitful soil\r\nand an unfriendly climate, he is often on the verge of want.\r\n\r\nStill more wretched is the condition of the cottars and squatters. The\r\nlatter are in some places numerous and have taken up considerable\r\nportions of land formerly used as common, thus interfering with the\r\nrights of the crofters. They appropriate land and possess and pasture\r\nstock, but pay no rent, obey no control, and scarcely recognize any\r\nauthority. The dwellings of this class and of some of the poorer\r\ncrofters are wretched in the extreme. A single apartment, with walls of\r\nstone and mud, a floor of clay, a thatched roof, no windows, no chimney,\r\none low door furnishing an entrance for the occupants and a means of\r\nventilation and of escape for the smoke which rolls up black and thick\r\nfrom the peat fire, furniture of the rudest imaginable sort, the\r\ninhabitants--the human beings, the cows, the pigs, the sheep, and the\r\npoultry--all crowded together in the miserable and filthy hut, make up a\r\npicture which the most romantic and poetic associations can hardly\r\nrender pleasing to one accustomed to the comforts and refinements of\r\nmodern civilization. Of course many of the crofters live in greater\r\ncomfort, and some of the cottages are by no means unattractive. But the\r\nRoyal Commissioners say that the crofter's habitation is usually \"of a\r\ncharacter that would imply physical and moral degradation in the eyes of\r\nthose who do not know how much decency, courtesy, virtue, and even\r\nrefinement survive amidst the sordid surroundings of a Highland hovel.\"\r\nAn Englishman who, on seeing these \"sordid surroundings,\" was disposed\r\nto compare the social and moral condition of the people to \"the\r\nbarbarism of Egypt,\" was told that if he would ask one of the crofters,\r\nin Gaelic or English, \"What is the chief end of man?\" he would soon see\r\nthe difference.\r\n\r\nWith such a history, such traditions, grievances, conditions, and\r\nhardships, it is not strange that the crofter should be ready to join an\r\nagitation that promised a remedy. Some of his grievances and claims have\r\nbeen so similar to those of the Irish tenant that the legislation which\r\nfollowed the violent agitation in Ireland has led him to hope for\r\nrelief-measures similar to those enacted for the Irish tenantry. The\r\nIrish Land Act of 1870 recognized the tenant's right to the permanent\r\npossession of his holding and to his improvements, by providing that on\r\nbeing turned out by his landlord he should have compensation for\r\ndisturbance and for his improvements. It did not, however, secure him\r\nagainst the landlord's so increasing his rent as practically to\r\nappropriate his improvements and even force him to leave his holding\r\nwithout any compensation. The Land Act of 1881 secured his interests by\r\nestablishing a court which should fix a fair rent, by giving him a right\r\nto compensation for disturbance and for his improvements, and by\r\nallowing him to sell his interests for the best price he can get for\r\nthem. It also enabled him to borrow from the government, at a low rate\r\nof interest, three-fourths of the money necessary to purchase his\r\nlandlord's interest in the holding. This legal recognition and guarantee\r\nof the Irish tenant's interests have led the crofter to hope that his\r\nclaims, based on better grounds, may also be conceded.\r\n\r\nThe changes recently made in the land laws of England and Scotland, and\r\nthe activity of the advocates of further and more radical changes, have\r\nincreased this hope. Progressive English statesmen have long looked with\r\ndisfavor upon entails and settlements, and there have been a number of\r\nenactments providing for cutting off entails and increasing the power of\r\nlimited owners. The last and most important of these, the Settled\r\nEstates Act, passed in 1882, gives the tenant for life power to sell any\r\nportion of the estate except the family mansion, and thus thoroughly\r\nundermines the principle upon which primogeniture and entails are\r\nfounded. Much land which has hitherto been so tied up that the limited\r\nowners were either unable or unwilling to develop it can now be sold and\r\nimproved. New measures have been proposed to increase still further the\r\npower of limited owners and to make the sale and transfer of land easier\r\nand less expensive. Many able statesmen are advocates of these measures.\r\nMr. Goschen in a recent speech at Edinburgh urged the need of a\r\nland-register by which transfers of land might be made almost as cheaply\r\nand easily as transfers of consols. By such an arrangement, it is held,\r\nmany farmers of small capital will be enabled to buy their farms, and\r\nthe land of the country will thus be dispersed among a much larger\r\nnumber of owners. There has also been a very marked tendency to enlarge\r\nthe rights and the authority of the tenant farmer. The Agricultural\r\nHoldings Act of 1883 gives the tenant a right to compensation for\r\ntemporary and, on certain conditions, for permanent improvements, and\r\npermits him in most cases, where he cannot have compensation, to remove\r\nfixtures or buildings which he has erected, contrary to the old doctrine\r\nthat whatever is fixed to the soil becomes the property of the landlord.\r\nThe landlord's power to distrain for rent is greatly reduced: formerly\r\nhe could distrain for six years' rent, now he can distrain only for the\r\nrent of one year, and he is required to give the tenant twelve instead\r\nof six months' notice to quit. The tenant is therefore more secure than\r\nformerly in the possession of his farm and in spending money and labor\r\nin making improvements that will render it more productive. Other\r\nchanges are proposed, which will give him still more rights, greater\r\nfreedom in the management of the farm, and additional encouragement to\r\nadopt the best methods of farming and invest his labor and money in\r\nimprovements. Many of the land reformers advocate the adoption of\r\nmeasures similar to those that have been enacted for Ireland. It has for\r\nsome time been one of the declared purposes of the Farmers' Alliance to\r\nsecure a system of judicial rents for the tenant farmers of England. An\r\nimportant conference lately held at Aberdeen and participated in by\r\nrepresentatives of both the English and Scottish Farmers' Alliances\r\nadopted an outline of a land bill for England and Scotland, providing\r\nfor the establishment of a land court, fixing fair rents, fuller\r\ncompensation for improvements, and the free sale of the tenant's\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe wretched condition of the dwellings of the agricultural laborers in\r\nmany parts of the country has attracted much attention, and plans for\r\nbettering their condition have frequently been urged. Lately the\r\ninterest in the subject has increased, prominent statesmen on both sides\r\nhaving espoused the cause. In view of the political power which the\r\nrecent extension of the suffrage has given to the agricultural laborers,\r\nthere is a general expectation that a measure will shortly be enacted\r\nrequiring the owner or occupier of the farm to give each laborer a plot\r\nof ground \"of a size that he and his family can cultivate without\r\nimpairing his efficiency as a wage-earner,\" at a rent fixed by\r\narbitration, and providing for a loan of money by the state for the\r\nerection of a proper dwelling. The provisions of the Irish Land Act and\r\nits amendment relating to laborers' cottages and allotments suggest the\r\nlines along which legislation for the improvement of laborers' dwellings\r\nin England and Scotland is likely to proceed.\r\n\r\nThen there is the scheme for nationalizing the land, the state paying\r\nthe present owners no compensation, or a very small amount, and assuming\r\nthe chief functions now exercised by the landlords. No statesman has yet\r\nventured to advocate this scheme, but it has called forth a great deal\r\nof discussion on the platform and in the newspapers and reviews, and has\r\ncaptivated most of those who are inclined to adopt socialistic theories\r\nof property. Mr. George himself has preached his favorite doctrine to\r\nthe crofters, whose views of their own rights in the land have led them\r\nto look upon the plan with more favor than the English tenants. Others,\r\ntoo, who have plans to advocate for giving tenants and laborers greater\r\nrights have taken special pains to have their views presented to the\r\ncrofters, since the claims of the latter against the landlords seem to\r\nrest upon so much stronger grounds than those of the English tenant.\r\n\r\nThe agitations for the reform of the land laws in Ireland and England,\r\nand the utterances of the advocates of the various plans for increasing\r\nthe rights and privileges of the tenant, have led the crofters to dwell\r\nupon their grievances until they have become thoroughly aroused. They\r\nhave in many cases refused to pay rent, have resisted eviction and\r\ndriven away officers who attempted to serve writs, have offered violence\r\nto the persons or property of some of those who have ventured to take\r\nthe crofts of evicted tenants, and in some instances have taken forcible\r\npossession of lands which they thought ought to be added to their\r\ncrofts. The government found it necessary a short time ago to send\r\ngunboats with marines and extra police to some of the islands and\r\ndistricts to restore the authority of the law. The crofters and their\r\nfriends are thoroughly organized, and seem likely to insist upon their\r\nclaims with the persistency that is characteristic of their race. It is\r\nnow generally conceded that some remedy must be provided for their\r\ngrievances and hardships.\r\n\r\nThe remedy that has been most frequently suggested, the only one\r\nrecommended by the Emigration Commissioners in 1841 and by Sir John\r\nMcNeil in 1852, is emigration. The crofting system, it has often been\r\nurged, belongs to a bygone age; it survives only because of its\r\nremoteness from the centres of civilization and the ruggedness of the\r\ncountry; the implements used by the crofters are of the most primitive\r\nsort, while their agricultural methods are \"slovenly and unskilful to\r\nthe last degree.\" It is impossible for these small farmers, with their\r\ncrude implements and methods, to compete with the large farmers, who\r\nhave better land and use the most improved implements and methods.\r\nBesides, many of the crofters are, and their ancestors for many\r\ngenerations have been, \"truly laborers, living chiefly by the wages of\r\nlabor, and holding crofts and lots for which they pay rents, not from\r\nthe produce of the land, but from wages.\" If they cannot find employment\r\nwithin convenient distance of their present homes, the best and kindest\r\nthing for them is to help them to go where there is a good demand for\r\nlabor and better opportunities for earning a decent livelihood. To\r\nencourage them to stay on their little crofts, where they are frequently\r\non the verge of want, is unkind and very bad policy. One who has seen\r\nthe wretched hovels in which some of these crofter families live, the\r\nsmall patches of unproductive land on which they try to subsist, the\r\nhardships which they sometimes suffer, and the lack of opportunities for\r\nbettering their condition in their native Highlands or islands, and who\r\nknows how much has been accomplished by the enterprise and energy of\r\nHighlanders in other parts of the world, can hardly help wishing that\r\nthey might all be helped to emigrate to countries where their industry\r\nand economy would more certainly be rewarded, and where they would have\r\na fairer prospect for success in the struggle for life and advancement.\r\nMany of them would undoubtedly be far better off if they could emigrate\r\nunder favorable conditions. The descendants of many of those who were\r\nforced to leave their homes by \"cruel and heartless Highland lairds,\"\r\nand who suffered terrible hardships in getting to this country and\r\nfounding new homes, have now attained such wealth and influence as they\r\ncould not possibly have acquired among their ancestral hills. The Royal\r\nCommissioners recommended that the state should aid those who may be\r\nwilling to emigrate from certain islands and districts where the\r\npopulation is apparently too great for the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nThe crofters are, however, strongly attached to their native hills and\r\nglens, and they claim that such laws can and ought to be enacted as will\r\nenable them to live in comfort where they are. The present, it is urged,\r\nis a particularly favorable time to establish prosperous small farmers\r\nin many parts of the Highlands where sheep-farming has proved a failure.\r\nThe inhabitants of the coasts and islands are largely a seafaring\r\npeople. There is quite as much Norse as Celtic blood in the veins of\r\nmany of them, and the Norseman's love of the sea leads them naturally to\r\nfishing or navigation. The herring-fisheries, with liberal encouragement\r\non the part of the government, might be made far more profitable to the\r\nfishermen and to the nation. Besides, the seafaring people of the\r\nHighlands and islands \"constitute a natural basis for the naval defence\r\nof the country, a sort of defence which cannot be extemporized, and\r\nwhich in possible emergencies can hardly be overrated.\" At the present\r\ntime they \"contribute four thousand four hundred and thirty-one men to\r\nthe Royal Naval Reserve,--a number equivalent to the crews of seven\r\narmored war-steamers of the first class.\" It is surely desirable to\r\nfoster a population which has been a \"nursery of good citizens and good\r\nworkers for the whole empire,\" and of the best sailors and soldiers for\r\nthe British navy and army. Public policy demands that every legitimate\r\nmeans be used to better the condition of the crofters and cottars, and\r\nto encourage them to remain in and develop the industries of their own\r\ncountry, instead of abandoning it to sheep and deer. Private interests\r\nmust be made subordinate to the public good. Parliament may therefore\r\ninterfere with the rights of landed property when the interests of the\r\npeople and of the nation demand it, as they do in this case.\r\n\r\nIt was on some such grounds that the Royal Commissioners recommended\r\nthat restrictions be placed upon the further extension of deer-forests,\r\nthat the fishing interests should be aided by the government, that the\r\nproprietors should be required to restore to the crofters lands formerly\r\nused as common pastures, and to give them, under certain restrictions,\r\nthe use of more land, enlarging their holdings, and that in certain\r\ncases they should be compelled to grant leases at rents fixed by\r\narbitration, and to give compensation for improvements. The government\r\nis already helping the fishermen by constructing a new harbor and by\r\nimproving means of communication and transportation, and proposes to\r\ngreatly lighten taxation in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe bill which the late government introduced into Parliament does not\r\nundertake to provide for aid to those who may wish to emigrate, or for\r\nthe compulsory restoration of common pasture, or for the enlargement of\r\nthe holdings. It does, however, propose to lend money on favorable terms\r\nfor stocking and improving enlarged or new holdings. As a convention of\r\nlandlords which was held at Aberdeen last January, and which represented\r\na large amount of land, resolved to increase the size of crofters'\r\nholdings as suitable opportunities offered and when the tenants could\r\nprofitably occupy and stock the same, the demand for more land seems\r\nlikely to be conceded in many cases without compulsory legislation. The\r\nbill defines a crofter to be a tenant from year to year of a holding of\r\nwhich the rent is less than fifty pounds a year, and which is situated\r\nin a crofting-parish. Every such crofter is to have security of tenure\r\nso long as he pays his rent and complies with certain other conditions;\r\nhis rent is to be fixed by an official valuer or by arbitration, if he\r\nand his landlord cannot agree in regard to it; he is to have\r\ncompensation, on quitting his holding, for all his improvements which\r\nare suitable for the holding; and his heirs may inherit his interests,\r\nalthough he may not sell or assign them. Such propositions seem radical\r\nand calculated to interfere greatly with proprietary rights and the\r\nfreedom of contract. They are, however, but little more than statements\r\nof the customs that already exist on some of the best estates. Just as\r\nthe government by the Irish Land Law Act (1881) took up the Ulster\r\ntenant-right customs, gave them the force of law, and extended them to\r\nall Ireland, it is proposed by this bill to give the sanction of law to\r\nthose customary rights which the crofters claim to have inherited from\r\nformer generations, and which have long been conceded by some of the\r\nlandlords.\r\n\r\nSuch a measure of relief will not make all the crofters contented and\r\nprosperous. It will, however, give them security against being turned\r\nout of their homes and against excessively high rents, and will\r\nencourage them to spend their labor and money in improving their\r\nholdings. If some assistance could be given to those who may wish to\r\nemigrate from overcrowded districts, and if the government would make\r\nliberal advances of money to promote the fishing industry, the prospect\r\nthat the discontent and destitution would disappear would be much\r\nbetter. The relief proposed will, however, be thankfully received by\r\nmany of the crofters and their friends.\r\n\r\n     DAVID BENNETT KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIEND GEORGE RANDALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince his own days at the university George Randall had always had a\r\nfriend or two among the students who came after him. I remember how in\r\nmy Freshman year I used to see Tom Wayward going up the stairs in the\r\nAcademy of Music building to his office, and how I used to envy Billy\r\nWylde when I met him arm in arm with George on one of the campus malls.\r\nIt was occasionally whispered about that Randall's influence on these\r\nyoung men was not of the very best, and that he used to have a\r\nnever-empty bottle of remarkably smooth whiskey in his closet, along\r\nwith old letter-files and brief-books; and it is undoubtedly true that\r\nPerry Tomson and I used to consider George's friends as models in the\r\nmanner of smoking a pipe, or ordering whiskey-and-soda at Bertrand's to\r\ngive us an appetite for our mutton-chops or our _bifteck aux\r\npommes_, and in the delightful self-sufficiency with which in the\r\npleasant spring days they would cut recitations and loll on the grass\r\nsmoking cigarettes right under the nose, almost, of the professor. But\r\nthey are both married now, and settled down to respectable conventional\r\nsuccess; and Billy Wylde, as I happen to know, has repaid the money\r\nwhich George lent him wherewith to finish his education in Germany. The\r\nestimable matrons of Lincoln who made so much ado over George's ruining\r\nthese young men,--who had such bright intellects and might have been\r\nexpected to do something but for that dreadfully well read lawyer's\r\nawful influence,--these women do not consider it worth their while now,\r\nin the face of the facts as they have turned out, to remember their\r\npredictions, but confine themselves to making their dismal prophecies\r\nanew in regard to the three young fellows whom George has of late taken\r\nup. But then I remember how they went on about Perry Tomson and me in\r\nthe early part of our Junior year, when we began to enjoy the favor of\r\nGeorge's friendship; and if their miserable croaking never does any\r\ngood, I fancy it will never work any very great harm: so one might as\r\nwell let them croak in peace. In fact, one would more easily dam the\r\nwaters of Niagara than stop them, and George, I know, doesn't care the\r\ncork of an empty beer-bottle what they say of him.\r\n\r\nI have never tried to analyze the influence for good George had over us,\r\nor account for it in any way, nor do I care to. I have always considered\r\nhis friendship for me as one of the pleasantest and most profitable\r\nexperiences of my life in Lincoln. Perry and I were always more close\r\nand loving friends, and cared for George with a silent but abiding sense\r\nof gratitude in addition to the other sources of our affection for him,\r\nafter he showed us the boyish foolishness of our quarrel about Lucretia\r\nKnowles. Of course I ought not to have grown angry at Perry's\r\ngood-natured cynicism; for how could he have imagined that I cared for\r\nher? Though I sometimes think, even now, that Perry was indeed anxious\r\nlest I should fall in love with her, and wanted to ridicule me out of\r\nthe notion, and I fear, in spite of his acquaintance, that he\r\ndisapproves of our engagement. I wonder if he will ever get over his\r\nprejudice against women. The dear old fellow! if he would only consent\r\nto know Lucretia better I am sure he would.\r\n\r\nOne night in the winter before we graduated, Perry and I went with\r\nGeorge to the Third House, which is a mock session of the legislature\r\nthat the political wags of the State take advantage of to display their\r\nwit and quickness at repartee and ability to make artistic fools of\r\nthemselves. If it happens to be a year for the election of a senator, as\r\nit was in this case, the different candidates are in turn made fun of\r\nand held up to ridicule or approval; and the chief issues of the time\r\nare handled without gloves in a way that is always amusing and often\r\nworth while in showing the ridiculous nature of some of them. The Third\r\nHouse is usually held on some evening during the first or second week of\r\nthe session, and is opened by the Speaker calling the house to order\r\nwith a thundering racket of the gavel--\"made from the wood of trees\r\ngrown on the prairies of the State\"--and announcing the squatter\r\ngovernor. Since the State was a territory, this announcement, after due\r\nformalities, has been followed by the statement that, as the squatter\r\ngovernor is somewhat illiterate, his message will be read by his private\r\nsecretary. After this personage has read his score or more pages of\r\njokes, sarcastic allusions, and ridiculous recommendations, the\r\ndiscussion of the message takes place, during which any one who thinks\r\nof a bright remark may get up and fire it at the gallery; and many very\r\nlame attempts pass for good wit, and much private spite goes for\r\nharmless fooling.\r\n\r\nGeorge got us seats in the gallery next to old Billy Gait, the\r\nbald-headed bachelor, who owns half a dozen houses which he rents for\r\nfifty dollars a month each, and who lives on six hundred a year,\r\ninvesting the surplus of his income every now and then in another house.\r\nWilliam, as usual, had a pretty girl at his elbow, and we heard him\r\ntelling her how he could never get interested in George Eliot's novels,\r\nand how it beat him to know why he ever wrote such tedious books. The\r\nyoung lady smiled over her fan at Randall, and said that she supposed\r\nMr. Eliot had a great deal of spare time on his hands, but of course he\r\nhad no business to employ it in writing tiresome novels.\r\n\r\nGeorge, who knew everybody, had a kindly greeting for all who were\r\nwithin its reach, even for the tired-looking little school-teacher, who\r\nhad come out with her landlady's fifteen-year-old son as an escort and\r\nin a little while had settled down to quiet enjoyment of the squatter\r\ngovernor's message, approving with a quiet smile the grin that\r\noccasionally spread over Perry's good-humored face. As for me, I was\r\nmade miserable from the start by seeing Lucretia Knowles in one of the\r\nbest seats on the floor, with a conceited fool of a\r\nnewspaper-correspondent at her side, whispering nonsense in her ear at\r\nsuch a rate that she did nothing but laugh and turn her pretty head back\r\nto speak with Mamie Jennings, her _fidus Achates_, and never once cast\r\nher eyes toward the gallery. She has said since that she knew I was\r\nthere all the time, and that she didn't dare look at me, because I was\r\nsuch a frightful picture of jealousy, with my fingers in my hair and my\r\nelbow on the gallery railing, staring down on the floor as if I should\r\nlike to drop a bomb and annihilate the entire lot. It is all very well\r\nto look back now and laugh and feel sorry for the curly-locked\r\njournalist, who is writing letters from Mexico and trying to get over\r\nthe disappointment which the knowledge of our engagement gave him, but\r\nit was very little fun for me at the time.\r\n\r\nI turned away a dozen times, and swore inwardly that I wouldn't look\r\nthat way again, and after each resolve I would find my eyes glancing\r\nfrom one person to another in Lu's vicinity, until finally they would\r\nrest again on her. When I had declared for the thirteenth time that I\r\nwouldn't contemplate her heartless flirting, I noticed George bow to\r\nsome one who had just come in at the gallery door. A young man from one\r\nof the western counties was making a satirical speech in favor of the\r\nwoman's suffrage amendment, misquoting Tennyson's \"Princess\" and making\r\nthe gallery shake with laughter, at the time; but I noticed George's\r\nface light up and his eyes sparkle with pleasure at the sight of the\r\nnew-comer. She was a beautiful lady, over thirty, I should say, with the\r\nsweetest face, for a sad one, I had ever seen. Of course, in a certain\r\nway I like Lucretia's style of beauty better; but Mrs. Herbert was\r\nbeautiful in a way, so far as the women I have ever seen are concerned,\r\npeculiar to herself. She was rather slender, and had a calm, graceful\r\nbearing that I somehow at once associated with purity and nobleness. She\r\nwas quite simply dressed, and had on a small widow's bonnet, with the\r\nribbons tied under her chin, while a charming little girl, whose hair\r\ncurled obstinately over her forehead, had hold of her hand.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat surprised--I will not say disappointed exactly--to see\r\nher lips break into a glad smile, though it made her face look all the\r\nlovelier and sweeter, in reply to George's greeting; and when she came\r\ntoward us, as he beckoned her to do, every one immediately and gladly\r\nmade room for her to pass. Perry and I gave our seats to Mrs. Herbert\r\nand her little girl; and I found myself speculating, as I leaned against\r\none of the pillars, on the difference of expression in the eyes of the\r\ntwo, which were otherwise so much alike,--the same deep shade of brown,\r\nthe same soft look, the same lashes, and yet what a vast difference when\r\none thought of the combined effect of all these similar details. I spoke\r\nto Perry of it, and he good-naturedly poked fun at me, saying I was\r\nforever trying to see a romance or a history in people's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose you will say she isn't even lovely,\" I exclaimed, with\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\"I'm no judge,\" he replied, with exasperating carelessness; \"but a\r\nlittle too pale, I should say. I wish George hadn't introduced her to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it made me feel cheap to have to back into old Billy Gait's bony\r\nlegs and try to bow and shake hands before everybody,--in the eyes of\r\nthe assembled community, as Charley McWenn would say.\"\r\n\r\nMcWenn was the stupid block of a journalist,--for I do think him a\r\nstupid block, in spite of his cleverness,--and I realized then that I\r\nhad forgotten for a moment all about Lucretia. I could not see her from\r\nmy new position, so I amused myself by imagining how she was carrying\r\non.\r\n\r\nAt last George and Mrs. Herbert rose up to go, and the former, as he\r\nasked our forgiveness for leaving us, told us to come to his office when\r\nwe had enough of the Third House, and, if he wasn't there, to wait for\r\nhim. \"We'll go over to Bertrand's and have some oysters,\" he said, with\r\nhis confidence-inspiring smile. I have always thought that if George had\r\nnot had so pleasant a smile and such a soulful laugh we should never\r\nhave been such friends.\r\n\r\nWe found him waiting for us at the foot of the Academy of Music stairs,\r\nwith a cigar in his mouth and one for each of us in his hand, and we\r\nknew from experience that his case was filled with a reserve.\r\n\r\n\"It's a pleasant night, boys, isn't it?\" he said, looking up at the\r\nstars (wonderfully bright they were in the clear, cold atmosphere) as we\r\nwent, crunching the snow under our feet, along the deserted streets to\r\nthe little back-entrance we knew of to Bertrand's.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Perry; \"but you missed the best thing of the whole circus by\r\nleaving before Colonel Bouteille made his speech in favor of the\r\nprohibition amendment.\" And he gave a _résumé_ of the colonel's\r\nlaughable sophistry for George's benefit,--and for mine as well, for I\r\nhad paid no attention to the old toper's remarks.\r\n\r\nWe could see the glimmer of lights behind the shutters of the faro-room\r\nover Sudden's saloon and hear the rattle of the ivory counters as we\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\"Do you ever go up there?\" asked George, interrupting Perry.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes; sometimes,\" we answered.\r\n\r\n\"Play a little now and then? I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't like to loaf around such a place,\" said Perry rather grandly,\r\nconsidering our circumstances, \"without putting down a few dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said George; \"but once or twice is enough, boys.\r\nAfter you have seen what the thing is like, keep away from the tiger.\r\nShe is a greedy beast, and always hungry; and of course you can't think\r\nof sitting down at a poker-table with the professional players.\"\r\n\r\nDirect advice was rather a new strain for Randall, and we were not\r\nsurprised when he dropped it abruptly as we filed into a little private\r\nroom at the restaurant.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I fancy old Bouteille might have made a humorous speech,\" he said,\r\nafter ordering the oysters. \"Three?\" he added, looking at me, \"or four?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quarts?\" I asked in reply.\r\n\r\nGeorge nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Two, I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother!\" exclaimed Perry. \"We should only have to trouble the\r\nwaiter again.\"\r\n\r\nSo George ordered four bottles of beer.\r\n\r\n\"It's after ten o'clock, sir,\" said the waiter doubtfully. It is\r\nneedless to say that he was a new one.\r\n\r\n\"That's the reason we came here,\" answered George, with a calm manner of\r\nassumption that dissipated the waiter's doubts while it evidently filled\r\nhim with remorse. \"Where's Auguste?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's gone to bed, sir; but I guess 'twill be all right.\" And the waiter\r\nstarted to fetch the beer.\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" growled Perry.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is not good form to drink beer with oysters,\" I suggested\r\nmildly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, I'm sure,\" said George.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose not,\" said Perry; \"they go so well together. I hope it isn't,\r\nat any rate: I like to do things that are bad form.\"\r\n\r\nSo I relapsed into silence, and my speculations about George's outbreak\r\nagainst gambling, and Mrs. Herbert's beautiful face and sad eyes, and\r\nLucretia Knowles's wicked light-heartedness.\r\n\r\nWhen we had finished eating and had opened the last bottle of beer, I\r\nasked George, as he stopped his talk with Perry for a moment to relight\r\nhis cigar, who Mrs. Herbert was.\r\n\r\n\"She is the noblest and most unfortunate woman in the world,\" he\r\nreplied, \"I will tell you her story some time, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hear it now,\" I cried, looking at Perry with triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let us,\" said Perry, nothing to my surprise, for I knew his heart\r\nwas in the right place, if his ways were a little rough and\r\nunimpressionable-like. \"We have no recitations, no lectures, no\r\nanything, to-morrow, and there is no one else in the restaurant but the\r\nwaiter, and he is asleep.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, we could hear him snoring.\r\n\r\n\"No, I would rather not tell it here,\" George said simply; \"but if you\r\nwill come with me to the office you shall hear it.\" And when we had\r\nheard it we respected the feeling that had prompted him to consider even\r\nthe walls of such a place as unfit listeners. To be sure, it was a very\r\ncomfortable restaurant, where the waiters were always attentive and\r\nskilful and the mutton-chops irreproachable, and many a pleasant evening\r\nhad we three had there over our cigars and Milwaukee, and sometimes a\r\nbottle or two of claret. But so had Tom Hagard, the faro-dealer, and\r\nFrank Sauter, who played poker over Sudden's, and Dick Bander, who got\r\nhis money from Madame Blank because he happened to be a swashing\r\nslugger, and many another Tom, Dick, and Harry whose reputations were,\r\nto say the least, questionable. Of course we never associated with such\r\ncharacters, and plenty of estimable people besides ourselves frequented\r\nBertrand's. The place was not in bad odor at all, but merely a little\r\nmiscellaneous, and suited our plebeian fancies all the more on that\r\naccount. If young fellows want to be really comfortable in life, we\r\nthought, and see a little at first hand just what sort of people make up\r\nthe world, they must not be too particular. So we used to sit down at\r\nthe next table to one where a gambler or a horse-jockey would perhaps be\r\nseated, or a man of worse fame, and order our humble repast with a quiet\r\nconscience and a strengthened determination never to become one among\r\nsuch people. We would even see the gay flutter of skirts sometimes, as\r\nthe waiter entered one of the private rooms with an armful of dishes,\r\nand hear the chatter and laughter of the wearers.\r\n\r\nWe did not wonder, therefore, at George's preference for his own office,\r\nwhose four walls had never looked down upon anything but innocent young\r\nfellows smoking and talking whatever harmless nonsense came into their\r\nheads, or playing chess or penny-ante, or upon his own generous thoughts\r\nand solitary contemplations, or hard work on some intricate lawsuit. So\r\nwe aroused the sleeping waiter, and walked back to the Academy of Music\r\nbuilding in silence.\r\n\r\n\"It is rather a long story,\" said George, when we had at last made\r\nourselves comfortable, \"and I have never told it before. I don't know\r\nwhy I should tell it now, but somehow I want to. I felt this evening\r\nafter I left the Capitol that I would, and I asked leave of Mrs. Herbert\r\nwhile we were walking to her home together. I knew she would let me: I\r\nam the only friend, I suppose,--the only real friend, I mean, whom she\r\ntrusts and treats as an intimate friend,--that she has in the world. I\r\nknow I am the only person who knows the whole story of her sad life.\r\n\r\n\"When I was in the university,\" he slowly continued, holding his cigar\r\nin the gas-jet and turning it over and over between his fingers, with an\r\nevident air of collating his reminiscences, \"Phil Kendall and I were\r\ngreat friends. I don't know how we ever came to be so: it was natural, I\r\nsuppose, for us to like each other. I used to notice that he did not\r\nassociate much with the other fellows; and yet he was the best runner\r\nand boxer in the class. He was the only fellow in the university who\r\ncould do the giant swing on the bar, and, though he had never taken\r\nlessons, it was next to impossible for any one but Wayland, the\r\nsub-professor in chemistry, to touch him with the foils. Somehow we were\r\ndrawn together, and before long were hardly ever apart. We used to get\r\nout our Horace together, he with the pony and text and I with the\r\nlexicon, for he was too impatient to hunt up the words. I believe you\r\nstudy differently now.\"\r\n\r\n\"We still have the pony,\" said Perry.\r\n\r\n\"And we used to puzzle our heads together over Mechanics, for we didn't\r\nhave election as you do, and take long walks, and play chess, and get up\r\nspreads in our room for nobody but us two. Not such elaborate affairs as\r\nare called spreads now, but I warrant you they were fully as much\r\nenjoyed. I fancy we were rather sentimental. We used to hold imaginary\r\nconversations in the person of some favorite characters in fiction; but\r\nwe were very young and boyish.\"\r\n\r\nPerry glanced at me sheepishly, but George went on without noticing:\r\n\r\n\"Phil's father lived here, and was proprietor of the only wholesale\r\ngrocery-store the town then boasted of. He had been captain of a\r\nvolunteer company in the war, and, I fancy, had a romance too. At any\r\nrate, his wife had been dead since Phil was a little fellow in\r\nknickerbockers; and not very long after her death a certain Mrs. Preston\r\nhad sent a little girl, about a year older than Phil, with a dying\r\ncharge to the captain to care for the friendless orphan for the sake of\r\ntheir early love. No one but Grace could ever get anything out of the\r\nold gentleman about her mother, and she never learned much. Mrs. Preston\r\nhad been unhappy at least, and perhaps miserable, in her marriage. We\r\nalways thought she had forsaken Mr. Kendall in their youth and made a\r\nhasty marriage; but never a word was uttered by him about Grace's\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"I used to imagine Mr. Kendall cared more for his adopted daughter than\r\nfor his son, from what I saw of them, and I was at the house a good deal\r\nwith Phil. I am sure they were very affectionate; and it was only\r\nnatural that the melancholy old man--that is the way he always struck\r\nme--should have loved the daughter of the woman who had deserted him and\r\nthen turned toward him in her hour of supreme need. It showed that her\r\ntrust and belief in him and his goodness had never really left her. And,\r\nbesides, Grace was always so airy and light-hearted,--nothing could put\r\nher out of humor,--so kind and gentle, and as lovely as a flower. She is\r\na splendid-looking woman yet, but one can have no idea of what she was\r\nin those days, from the sad-eyed Mrs. Herbert who smiles so rarely on\r\nany one but her little girl. Nannie is going to make much such a young\r\nlady as her mother was, but I don't believe she will ever be quite so\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was not long in discovering that Phil was in love with his\r\nfather's adopted daughter. I was never quite sure whether he knew it\r\nhimself at the time or not, but I could see easily enough that she\r\ndidn't dream of such a thing, nor the old captain either. They were so\r\nmuch like brother and sister it used to make me feel wofully sorry for\r\nPhil to see her throw her arms around his neck and kiss him for some\r\nlittle kindness or other that he was always doing her: the difference of\r\nmood in which the caress would be given from that in which Phil would\r\nreceive it was somehow always painful to me. Phil would never offer to\r\nkiss her on his own account; and it is still a mystery to me why she\r\nnever discovered how he felt toward her until he became jealous. The\r\ntenderness and gentle considerateness of his bearing were always so\r\nmarked that to a less innocent and pure nature, I fancy, it would have\r\nbeen noticeable at once.\r\n\r\n\"When we were Juniors, Phil took her to a party one night, just after\r\nEaster. The captain was a scrupulous Churchman, and Grace was always by\r\nhim in the pew. She had not been confirmed, however, and never said a\r\nword to Phil and me about our persistency in staying away from church,\r\nthough the captain used to lecture Phil quite soberly about it. This\r\nparty was given at the house of one of the vestrymen, and they had\r\nrefreshments, and, after the rector had gone home, dancing. They called\r\nit a sociable, and took up a collection for the ladies' aid society just\r\nafter the cake and coffee and whipped cream had been served. There was\r\nwhere Grace first met George Herbert. He was a handsome young fellow,\r\nwell educated, a graduate of some Eastern college, clever and talented,\r\nand his family in Rochester, New York, were considered very good people.\r\nHe had come to Lincoln to take a place on the 'Gazette,' and every one\r\nthought him a young man of good parts and fair prospects.\r\n\r\n\"He made up to Grace from the start. They were laughing and talking\r\ntogether all the evening on a little sofa, just large enough for two,\r\nthat stood in the bow-window. There was a little crowd of young people\r\naround the two most of the time, and she was saying bright things to\r\nthem all, but never, I noticed, at the expense of young Herbert, who\r\nmade most of his remarks so low that no one but Grace could hear them.\r\nShe always smiled and often broke out into her musical laugh at what he\r\nsaid; and when Phil, who had been trapped into a game of whist with some\r\nold fogies, finally came back into the parlor and made his way to where\r\nGrace was having such a happy time, she even launched a shaft or two of\r\nher wit at him.\r\n\r\n\"I saw that the poor fellow was hurt: he turned away without answering,\r\nthough, and, coming over to where I was, sat down and began looking at\r\nan album, trying hard all the time to hide his feelings. But in a moment\r\nGrace was hanging over his shoulder, oblivious of her surroundings, and\r\nlovingly begging his pardon if she had hurt him. I have sometimes\r\nthought that Phil then fully realized for the first time how he cared\r\nfor her. The way in which her affection disregarded the presence of the\r\ncrowd smote him, I imagine, with something like despair. I saw him turn\r\npale and catch his breath, and I knew his laugh too well to be deceived,\r\nas Grace was, when he made light of her self-accusations and declared\r\nthat than taking offence at her words nothing had been further from his\r\nthoughts. This was in a sense true, of course, for ordinarily he would\r\nhave answered as light-heartedly almost as Grace herself; and it was\r\nonly the feeling of jealousy, unconscious perhaps, at any rate\r\nirresistible, that gave her words undue--no, not that exactly, but\r\nunusual influence over his feelings.\r\n\r\n\"For a while Phil acted as considerately as ever, and made himself\r\nthoroughly agreeable to several young ladies, whereat Grace was highly\r\npleased and soon took up again her mood of gayety. But when Phil brought\r\nher a plate and napkin and some things to eat, and found her and Herbert\r\nalready served and with mock gravity breaking a piece of cake together\r\non the stairs,--'they were only doing it,' Phil declared to me\r\nafterward, 'that they might touch each other's hands,'--he lost his\r\nhead. He must have spoken very bitterly, else he would never have\r\naroused Grace's anger. I don't know what he said, except that he\r\ncomplained about having come to such a thing as a church sociable, which\r\nhe despised, and, inasmuch as he had done it for the sake of her\r\nenjoyment and pleasure, she might at least have shown him the same\r\npoliteness she would have accorded to any of the insufferable prigs whom\r\nshe seemed delighted to honor.\r\n\r\n\"Herbert started to reply, but Grace silenced him by a look, and said,\r\n'We have been as brother and sister since childhood.' It was probably\r\nwell for Herbert's handsome face that he did not enter into a discussion\r\nwith Phil. They were both hot-tempered, and Phil had no scruples against\r\nasking him out of doors, and would have been as cool in his manner and\r\nas terrible in his strength as an iceberg.\r\n\r\n\"Grace led Phil away, and tried to tell him how she had not supposed he\r\nwould care; that she had imagined he would prefer to serve the young\r\nlady with whom he had been talking; how she had never known him to put\r\nsuch store by trivialities before; how 'at least we,' Phil told me,\r\nbitterly quoting her words, 'at least we ought to be sure of each\r\nother's hearts,' and did everything to pacify him. But he would listen\r\nto nothing, and, coming to me, asked me to walk home with Grace, as he\r\nwas going away immediately. I imagined the trouble, and got him to admit\r\nthat he and Grace had said unkind words to each other. But he would say\r\nnothing more about the matter till I found him in my room after it was\r\nall over, when he raved about Grace until near morning, and cursed the\r\nfate that had turned the bread of her kind affection for him into a\r\nstone. 'How can I ever hope to win her love when she thinks that way of\r\nme?' he would ask sorrowfully, after telling of some pure and loving\r\nfreedom she had taken. I was full of pity for the miserable fellow, but\r\nI felt as if I ought to do all I could to discourage him. I was sure he\r\nwas right; he never could hope to, and I thought the sooner he learned\r\nthis, and to submit to it, the better it would be for him.\r\n\r\n\"I persuaded him not to leave the party in the height of his resentment,\r\nthough, and he was so quiet before the dancing that I began to hope he\r\nwould beg Grace's pardon and take her home repentantly and in peace. But\r\nhe insisted on my going and offering to dance with her the first set in\r\nhis place. She had already promised, she said, to dance it with Mr.\r\nHerbert, and it was in vain that I told her she must look upon me as\r\nacting for Phil, and advised her for his sake to excuse herself to\r\nHerbert and dance with either Phil or myself. 'If Phil should come and\r\nask me himself on his knees I would not do it,' she declared, with\r\nsuperb grandeur, 'He has acted wrong, and imputed to me the worst\r\nmotives for trivial things which I did unthinkingly even, and, heaven\r\nknows, without deliberate calculation.'\r\n\r\n\"I saw it was no use to talk with her, and that in her present mood even\r\nentreaty, to which she was usually so yielding, would be of no avail. I\r\nfelt very helpless and miserable about it, but I could do nothing. I saw\r\nthat Phil had made a grave mistake by accusing her of partiality for\r\nHerbert, and that her acquaintance with him might possibly be forced\r\ninto a closer relation by Phil's jealousy. I kept away from him for a\r\nwhile, and almost made Miss Scrawney think I had fallen in love with\r\nher, in order to keep Phil from getting a word with me. At last,\r\nhowever, just as the music began, he pulled my sleeve and asked in a\r\nwhisper if I wasn't going to take Grace out and dance with her.\r\n\r\n\"'She was already engaged,' I answered.\r\n\r\n\"'To whom?' said Phil. 'But there is no need to ask.' And at the moment,\r\nindeed, almost as if in answer to his question, Grace entered the room\r\nfrom the hall on Herbert's arm. I was afraid for an instant that Phil\r\nwould make a scene. The veins on his forehead swelled, and he started\r\nforward as they passed within a few feet of where we were standing,\r\nGrace smiling and talking to Herbert, apparently as oblivious of us as\r\nif we had not been within a thousand miles of her; but he mastered the\r\nimpulse, whatever it was, and I have often speculated as to whether it\r\nwas to upbraid Grace or to strike Herbert.\r\n\r\n\"'Look at her, George,' he said, with a calmness that was belied by the\r\nlook in his eyes. 'You wouldn't think that three hours ago she had never\r\nknown him, would you? nor that we had lived in the same house since we\r\nwere no higher than that. Her mother, I know, did her best to break my\r\nold man's heart, and I warrant you it was for some such worthless fool\r\nas that, who wasn't fit to black the dear old fellow's boots. Poor old\r\ndad! we shall be together in the boat: when I begin to handle hams and\r\nbarrelled sugar we will write ourselves 'Kendall & Son' with a\r\nflourish.' And as we went up the stairs to get his coat and hat he told\r\nme to stay and offer to go home with Grace. 'It wouldn't do for me to\r\nleave her unless you do, George,' he said; 'but if she wants to go with\r\nHerbert, let her; but she shall not say I went away and left her without\r\nan escort.'\r\n\r\n\"I promised readily enough, and even hurried him away. There was no good\r\nin his staying; in fact, I thought it better that he should leave; and\r\nafter he had gone I went to Grace. I managed the matter rather badly,\r\nbut I suppose the most consummate tact on my part would not have changed\r\nthings. I should have waited until I saw her alone, or until the party\r\nwas breaking up; but I went directly I saw they had stopped dancing. She\r\nwas leaning on the piano and letting Herbert fan her, and looking almost\r\ntoo beautiful for real life as she turned her face toward him, flushed\r\nwith her exercise and beaming with excitement. There was something grand\r\nto me in the expression of individuality and proud insistence that had\r\ncome to her so suddenly. It was no factitious strife of her nature\r\nagainst the dependence of her position as an adopted daughter, I knew,\r\nfor she had never felt in the least but that she was perfectly free; it\r\nwas no caprice or stubbornness; it was merely her womanly assertion of\r\nself and her unconscious protest against what she thought injustice. She\r\nwould not have believed from any one but Phil himself that he was in\r\nlove with her and jealous.\r\n\r\n\"'Phil has gone away,' I said bluntly, interrupting their talk. She\r\nlooked at me for a moment and raised her eyebrows slightly.\r\n\r\n\"'Has he?' was all she asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes: he was feeling badly,' I went on. 'He asked me to walk home with\r\nyou when you were ready to go. I thought I would tell you now, so you\r\nwould not be at a loss in case you should want to leave before the party\r\nbreaks up.'\r\n\r\n\"'You are very kind, I am sure, Mr. Kendall' (she usually called me\r\nGeorge), 'but I shall not want to go for ever so long yet. It was\r\nneedless for Phil to trouble you; he knew I should get home all\r\nright,--but it was like him. I am awfully sorry to keep you waiting: I\r\nknow you are anxious to get back to your pipe and books.'\r\n\r\n\"Here Herbert said something with the appearance of speaking to us both;\r\nbut she only could hear what it was. I, however, imagined readily\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\"'Will you?' she answered him, in a pleased tone, and I fancied her\r\nsmile was grateful. 'Mr. Herbert is going to stay and dance a while\r\nlonger,' she went on, turning to me, 'and if he takes me home it will\r\nnot seem as if I were troubling any one too much, and--'\r\n\r\n\"'Very well, Miss Preston,' I interrupted, making my best bow; 'as you\r\nlike.' And when I saw the smile on Herbert's face I didn't wonder much\r\nat the way Phil had felt. 'Let me bid you good-night,' I said, bowing\r\nagain, and started off.\r\n\r\n\"Grace followed me rapidly into the hall. 'Now, please don't you be\r\nangry too, George,' she said, laying her hand on my arm.\r\n\r\n\"'I am not angry,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you think it right, George,' she asked earnestly,--and there was a\r\npleading look in her eyes,--'or manly to desert one's friends in\r\ntrouble?'\r\n\r\n\"'I am doing the best I know how,' said I, 'to be true to my friend.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, George, I am so sorry!' Her voice trembled, and all her\r\nqueenliness had gone. 'You must not go off this way. You don't blame me\r\nas Phil does, do you? Wait, I will get my things, and you shall walk\r\nhome with me now. I will see Phil and tell him--'\r\n\r\n\"'He has gone to my room,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, I will wait till you bring him home. You must tell him I forgive\r\nhim,--or no, tell him I am sorry and ask his forgiveness. Oh, George, we\r\ncannot be this way. Only think how sad it would make his father--and--'\r\nThere were tears on her lashes, and her lips were trembling piteously.\r\nShe put her hand to her throat and could not go on. God forgive me if I\r\nwas wrong,--and I know I was,--but I couldn't help it then,--I asked,\r\nalmost with a sneer, if she didn't dislike to slight her estimable\r\nfriend Mr. Herbert's kindness; and she turned away without a word, as if\r\nregretting, from my unworthiness, the emotion she had shown.\r\n\r\n\"I was in very nearly as bad a state as Phil for a while. I told him\r\njust how I had acted, and he was rather pleased than otherwise at my\r\ncruelty. We tried hard to make ourselves believe that Grace had deserved\r\nit, and to a certain extent succeeded.\r\n\r\n\"'She probably thought it was too high a price,' said Phil, 'when she\r\nsaw both of us going off offended, and she concluded not to give it.\r\nBut, then, it was just like her,' he added, in a kindlier spirit than\r\nthe natural interpretation of his words seemed to indicate.\r\n\r\n\"It was a month before either of us went to the house. The old captain\r\nthought at first that we were going to the dogs, and, I think, kept up a\r\nkind of watch over our movements. He came in one morning, after he had\r\nconcluded his suspicions were wrong, and made a sort of expiatory call.\r\nHe tried to tell us how he had judged us too harshly, but couldn't quite\r\nbring himself to it, and, after a good many half-uttered remarks that\r\ndid honor to the old gentleman's heart, if they didn't prove him a cool\r\nhand in such matters, he left us with an unspoken blessing and some\r\nhomely, sound advice to do as we liked, so long as we were manly and\r\nhonest.\r\n\r\n\"Within a week he was stricken with apoplexy on receiving news of some\r\nserious losses, and was taken home without speaking. He died the next\r\nmorning just at sunrise, and Grace and Phil mingled their tears at his\r\nbedside. He tried in vain to speak to them, and the pleased light in his\r\neyes as they took each other's hands and laid them, joined together, in\r\nhis, was the only sign he gave of having known there had been a\r\ndifference between them.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Grace! she was very miserable and lonely after that. Phil could\r\nnever bear to be with her after he had spoken. Her true kindness and\r\ngentle, loving pity were misery to him. He made a noble effort to stay\r\nby and watch over her, but he was hardly fit to take care of himself.\r\nShe never knew how small a share of what little was left of his father's\r\nmoney he took with him to the mountains, but she realized why he went\r\nwithout waiting for his degree, and sadly approved his resolution. She\r\nalways kept the growing attachment between her and Herbert from grating\r\non Phil as much as was in her power, but he could not help seeing it.\r\nThough he never said anything even to me, it was plain that he had a\r\npoor opinion of the young journalist; and Grace was very thankful to him\r\nfor all he did and suffered.\r\n\r\n\"She must have felt very much alone in the world after Phil left, and\r\nthe house certainly seemed empty and sad when I used to go there to see\r\nher. There was no one but Grace and the housekeeper and an old\r\ngentleman, a clerk in one of the State departments, to whom she had\r\nrented rooms, partly for the money and partly to have a man in the\r\nhouse. Herbert was with her whenever his work would permit, and there\r\nwas some talk about their intimacy among people who, even if they had\r\nknown her, were too base to have appreciated the fineness and truth and\r\npurity of Grace's nature.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't blame her for marrying Herbert,--which she did the fall\r\nafter I graduated. They certainly were very much in love, and Herbert\r\nhad borne himself creditably in every way. No one could have foreseen\r\nthat he would turn out so badly; and for a year or more after their\r\nmarriage they were as happy as birds in May. Grace was never\r\nlight-hearted, as when I first knew her,--no woman of worth and\r\ntenderness would have been,--but still she was happily and sweetly\r\ncontented, completely bound up in her husband, thinking almost of\r\nnothing but him, and caring for nothing but his love.\r\n\r\n\"When I came back from the law-school, I went to see them as soon as I\r\nwas settled. They had sold the house, and were living in a rented\r\ncottage out in East Lincoln. Nannie, their baby, was quite if not more\r\nthan a year old then; and, though I had known that Grace would be a fond\r\nmother, I was unprepared to see the way in which she seemed absolutely\r\nto worship the child. I immediately asked myself if it meant that she\r\nwas not so happy with Herbert as she had been. I met him at tea, to\r\nwhich Grace insisted on my staying. His dress was as neat and as\r\ncarefully arranged as ever, and he was cordial enough toward me; but he\r\ndid not kiss Grace when he came in, and hardly looked at the baby. He\r\nlaughed a good deal, and told several amusing incidents of his newspaper\r\nexperience. I noticed that his old habit of looking at one's chin or\r\ncravat instead of at one's eyes when he spoke to one had grown upon him.\r\nHe excused himself soon after tea on the ground of having to be at the\r\noffice, and went away smoking a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Grace complained of the way in which his work kept him up nights. He\r\nwas never home until after midnight, she said, and sometimes not before\r\nmorning. She was afraid it was telling upon his health. 'You must come\r\nand see me often. George.' she said, as she gave me her hand at parting.\r\n'I see very little of my husband now, and, if it were not for Nannie, I\r\nfeel as if I should be almost unhappy. Then he would have to do some\r\nother work, though he likes journalism so well.' That was the nearest\r\nshe ever came to complaining to me, though I soon knew that she had\r\nplenty of cause. She was not entirely deceived by Herbert's assertions\r\nand excuses. I learned before long, for I made a point of finding out,\r\nthat he was never obliged to be at the office after nine o'clock, that\r\nhe gambled and drank, and was looked on with unpleasant suspicions by\r\nhis employers, so that he might at any time find himself without a\r\nposition. He owned no property, and Grace's little patrimony had\r\ndisappeared, even to the money they had received for the house, without\r\nleaving the slightest trace. Herbert's ill reputation was common\r\nproperty in the town, and he and Grace went nowhere together. She had\r\neven given up going to church, that she might be with him for a few\r\nhours on Sundays; and now and then if he took her for a walk and pushed\r\nthe baby-carriage through the Capitol-grounds for an hour, she cared\r\nmore for it than for a whole stack of Mr. Gittner's sermons. She had no\r\nfriends at all, and but few acquaintances, and altogether had much to\r\nbear up under. Right nobly she did it, too; never a word of complaint to\r\nany one: I believe not even to herself would she admit that she was\r\ntreated basely.\r\n\r\n\"They kept on in this way for a year after I opened my office. I heard\r\nfrom Phil now and then,--brief notes that he was alive and well,--and on\r\nthe 11th of June, the date of the old captain's death, Grace always\r\nreceived a long letter from him, full of references to their childhood,\r\nbut telling little of himself. Herbert's reputation became worse and\r\nworse, and he deserved all the evil that was said of him. The tradesmen\r\nrefused him credit, and the carpets and furniture of their little\r\ncottage grew old and thread-bare and were not replaced. I have seen him\r\nplay pool at Sudden's for half a day at a dollar a game, and perhaps\r\nlose his week's wages. He was hand in glove with the set that lurked\r\nabout the 'club-room' over the saloon, and almost any night could be\r\nseen at the faro-table fingering his chips and checking off the cards on\r\nhis tally-sheet. Nobody but strangers would sit down to a game of poker\r\nor casino with him: he had grown much too skilful. He was what they\r\ncalled a 'very smooth player:' though I never heard of his being openly\r\naccused of cheating.\r\n\r\n\"One of my first cases of consequence was to recover some money which\r\nhad been paid to some sharpers by an innocent young fellow from the East\r\nfor a worthless mine in Colorado. In connection with it I went to\r\nDenver. Charlie Wayland, a brother of the chemistry professor, happened\r\nto be on the same train. He owns the planing-mill down on Sixth Street\r\nnow, you know; but he was a wild young fellow then, and knew everything\r\nthat was going on. He intended to have a time, he said, while he was in\r\nDenver; that was what he was going for. He went with me to the St.\r\nJames, where I had written Phil to meet me, if he could come down from\r\nBoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Young Wayland had his time in the city, and I had finished my business\r\nand was going to start back and leave him to enjoy by himself his trip\r\nto Pike's Peak and the other sights of the State, considerably\r\ndisappointed at not having seen Phil, when he came in on us as I was\r\npacking my grip-sack. He was rough and hardy as a bear, and had grown a\r\ntremendous black beard: his heavy hand closed over mine till my knuckles\r\ncracked. We were glad enough to see each other, and had plenty to talk\r\nabout. Of course I stayed over another day, and Wayland put off his trip\r\nto Pike's Peak to keep us company, though we didn't care so much for his\r\npresence as he seemed to think we did. But he gave us a little dinner at\r\nCharpiot's, and I forgave his talkativeness for the sake of the\r\nchampagne, until he became excited by drinking too much of it and began\r\nto talk about George Herbert. He was stating his system of morality,\r\nwhich was, in effect,--and Charlie had acted up to it pretty well,--that\r\na fellow should go it when he was young, but when he was married he\r\nought to settle down.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, I can't stand a fellow like that Herbert,' he said; and for all\r\nmy kicks under the table he went on, 'It may be well enough for the\r\nFrench, but I say in this country it's a devilish shame. He is a young\r\nfellow in Lincoln, Mr. Kendall,--got a splendid wife, and a little baby,\r\none of the nicest women in the world, and thinks the world of him, and\r\nhe goes it with the boys as if he was one of 'em. He never goes home,\r\nthough, unless he is sober enough to keep himself straight; but I've\r\nseen him bowling full many a time. Wine, women, and song, you know, and\r\nall that; it may be well enough for us young bloods, but in a fellow of\r\nhis circumstances I say it's wrong, damn it! and he oughtn't to do it.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, I had told Phil that Grace was well and fairly happy. I had\r\nthought it but just to sink my opinion and give Grace's own account of\r\nherself and deliver her simple message without comment. 'Give Phil my\r\nlove,' she had said as I left her the night before I came away.\r\n\r\n\"'And how does this Herbert's wife take all this?' asked Phil of\r\nWayland.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, she doesn't know all, I suppose. If she did, it would probably\r\nkill her. My brother's wife says that if it were not for her child she\r\ndoesn't believe Mrs. Herbert would live very long, as it is.'\r\n\r\n\"'Her trouble is common talk, then?' observed Phil, sipping his wine and\r\navoiding my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, yes, to a certain extent; though she doesn't parade it, by any\r\nmeans. In fact, she lives very much alone; no one ever sees her, hardly,\r\nbut George here, who is an old friend, you know. Maybe you used to know\r\nher,' he added suddenly, coming to himself a little. 'Well, if you did,'\r\nhe went on, as Phil did not answer, 'you wouldn't know her now, they\r\nsay, for the lively, careless girl she was five or six years ago.' And\r\nthen he began to talk about the condition of the Chinese in Denver, and\r\nhow he had that morning seen one of them kicked off the sidewalk without\r\nhaving given the least provocation.\r\n\r\n\"Phil said nothing further about the Herberts all evening, but just\r\nbefore we separated for the night he asked me if I could let him have\r\nsome money. I unsuspectingly thanked my stars that I could, and told him\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, then,' he declared, 'I am going back to Lincoln with you\r\nto-morrow.' And, in spite of all I could say, he did. He had his beard\r\nshaved off, bought himself some civilized clothes, and made his\r\nappearance with me on the streets of Lincoln as naturally as if he had\r\ngone away but the day before. His life in the mountains had given him an\r\nair of decision, a certain quiet energy and determination which\r\nimpressed one immediately with the sense of his being a man of strong\r\ncharacter, with a powerful will under perfect control. I grew to have so\r\nmuch confidence in him that I thought his coming would somehow be a\r\nbenefit to Grace, though I could not see how; in fact, when I tried to\r\nreason about it, I told myself exactly the contrary. But Phil seemed to\r\nhave such implicit confidence in himself, to be so self-sufficient and\r\nso ready for any emergency, and altogether such a perfect man of action,\r\nthat he inspired belief and confidence in others.\r\n\r\n\"We met Herbert on our way up from the station: he was standing in front\r\nof the 'Gazette' office, laughing and talking with Sudden's barkeeper.\r\nHe greeted Phil with cordiality, in spite of the latter's distant\r\nbearing, and told him Grace would be greatly pleased at his arrival.\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose she will be glad to see me,' said Phil, as we passed on. And\r\nshe was glad, very glad, to see him, but she was far from being made\r\nhappy by his coming. I sent a note out to her, and Phil and I followed\r\nshortly after. I did not watch their meeting,--I thought, somehow, that\r\nno one ought to see it,--but I knew he took her in his arms; and when\r\nshe came out on the porch to bring me in there were tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We all sat and talked for a long while, Grace with her hand in Phil's\r\nand her eyes on his face, when she was not looking anxiously after my\r\nawkward attempts at caring for her baby; for of course Nannie had been\r\nbrought out almost the first thing. I think, from the way in which she\r\ncarefully avoided asking him his reasons for coming back, that she\r\ndivined what they were. I imagined that she blamed me as being the prime\r\ncause; but there was nothing I could say to undeceive her. In fact, I\r\nthought it better for her to believe so than to know the truth.\r\n\r\n\"'She is miserably unhappy, George,' said Phil gloomily, as we walked\r\naway. 'But you were right not to tell me. I can do nothing to help her:\r\nI cannot even openly sympathize with her. It would have been better to\r\nhave kept on thinking she was happy: there was a bitter kind of\r\nsatisfaction to me in that, but still it was a satisfaction.'\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless Phil did not go back to the mountains. He stayed on here\r\nfor a month or more, dividing his time pretty equally between my office\r\nand Grace's little parlor. He very seldom met Herbert. Now and then they\r\nwould be together at the cottage for half an hour, if Herbert happened\r\nto come home while he was there, and when they met on the street they\r\nwould merely pass the time of day.\r\n\r\n\"One evening before going to supper I waited until after seven o'clock\r\nfor Phil to come in, and just as I had given him up, and was starting\r\naway alone, he entered the office, looking pale as a ghost, and\r\nevidently in great distress of spirit.\r\n\r\n\"'For God's sake, Phil, what is the matter?' I exclaimed, as he sank\r\nupon the sofa and covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\n\"'Go away, George: go away and leave me,' was all he said; then he got\r\nup and began walking violently up and down the room. At last he came\r\nnear me and put his hand on my shoulder. 'I've killed her, George, I am\r\nafraid; At least I have killed him right before her eyes, and she may\r\nnever get over it. I didn't mean to, George, you know that; but he came\r\nhome drunk, and I had gone to bid Grace good-by,--for I had made up my\r\nmind, George, to leave to-morrow,--and he came in. We had been talking\r\nof father, and Grace was very sad and wretched, and there were tears in\r\nher eyes when she kissed me, just as he came in and saw us. She was\r\nfrightened at his brutality, and clung to me in terror, when he began\r\nswearing in a torrent of passion and calling her the vilest of names. He\r\nstruck at us with his cane. If he had struck me he might yet have been\r\nalive; but when I saw the great red welt on Grace's neck and heard her\r\ncry out, I was wild, George. For an instant, I believe, I could have\r\nstamped him into bits, and if it had been my last act on earth I could\r\nnot have helped striking him.'\r\n\r\n\"While he spoke, Phil stood with his hand on my shoulder, looking into\r\nmy eyes, as if he wanted me to judge him, as if he would read in my very\r\nlook whether I blamed him or not. I took his hand.\r\n\r\n\"'I thought you would understand,' he went on. 'I did not know I was\r\ngoing to kill him, but I think I tried to: I struck him with all my\r\nmight, Grace threw herself between us and begged me not to hurt him\r\nafter he had fallen down, and took hold of my arm as if to hold me. But\r\nwhen she saw the blood running from his temple, where he had struck it\r\non the window-sill, and how still and motionless he lay, she tried to go\r\nto him, but could not for weakness and fainting. I carried her into Mrs.\r\nStanley's, and have not seen her since, but the doctor says she is very\r\nill. Herbert was dead when they went into the room after I told them\r\nwhat had happened; and I suppose I had better give myself up to the\r\nlaw.'\r\n\r\n\"You can have no idea how I felt to see my dearest friend in such a\r\nposition. And poor Grace!--it was much worse for her. I thought with\r\nPhil that she might never survive the shock and misery of it all. But\r\nshe did, and came out, weak and broken down as she was, to give her\r\ntestimony at Phil's trial. We had no trouble in getting a jury to acquit\r\nhim, and he went back to Colorado without bidding Grace good-by,\r\nalthough she would have seen him and was even anxious to do so. Some\r\npersons here, mostly women, pretended to think that there had been more\r\ncause for Herbert's jealousy than was generally supposed; but they\r\nbelonged to the sanctimonious, hypocritical custom-worshippers. All\r\nreally good people remembered what Herbert had been, and refused to see\r\nin him a martyr or even a wronged man.\r\n\r\n\"After that Grace supported herself by dress-making and teaching music;\r\nand some two years ago, when we heard that Phil had been killed by a\r\nmine's caving in, and that he had left a little fortune to her and\r\nNannie, I, as his executor and her friend, induced her to take and use\r\nit,--which she did, with simplicity and thankfulness and with her heart\r\nfull of pity and love for poor Phil. Yes, poor Phil! those five or six\r\nyears must have been full of misery to him, and he was probably thankful\r\nwhen the end came. We never heard from him until after his death. There\r\nwas a letter that came to me with the will, that had been written long\r\nbefore. None but they two know what was in it; and I, for one, do not\r\nwant to inquire.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge sat for a long while in silence, looking at the glowing coals in\r\nthe huge reservoir stove. Neither Perry nor I cared to interrupt his\r\nrevery. At last he roused himself.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" he said, \"it is late: I think we had better go. It is all\r\nover now, and life has gone on calmly for years. Other people have\r\nforgotten that there ever were such persons as Phil or Herbert.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Perry and I reached our room we found it was almost three o'clock.\r\nGeorge had walked with us to the door, and very little had been said\r\nbetween us. I took a cigarette and lay down on the bed. \"Perry,\" I said,\r\nas he was lighting the gas.\r\n\r\n\"Sur to you,\" he answered, in a way he had of imitating a certain\r\nbarkeeper of our acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of George?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what I think of him as well as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but I mean in connection with this that he has told us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he acted just like himself all the way through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think he has been in love with Mrs. Herbert from the first?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I in the habit of imagining such nonsense?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may think it nonsense,\" I answered, with the quiet fervor of\r\nconviction, \"but I am sure it is nothing but the real state of the\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bosh!\" exclaimed Perry, throwing his boots into a corner; and therewith\r\nthe discussion closed.\r\n\r\nAbout a week ago I had a letter from him, though, in which he recalled\r\nthis circumstance and acknowledged that I had been in the right. \"They\r\nare going to be married in the fall,\" he wrote. \"I hope they may be\r\nhappy, and I suppose they will be; but I don't think Mrs. Herbert ought\r\nto marry him unless she loves him; and I am fearful that she only thinks\r\nto reward long years of faithful affection. George deserves more than\r\nthat.\" This was a good deal for Perry to manage to say. He usually keeps\r\nas far away from such subjects as he well can,--which is partly the\r\nreason, I think, that his opinion thereon is not greatly to be trusted.\r\nAs for me, I am sure George's wife will love him as much as he\r\ndeserves,--though this is almost an infinite amount,--and that she has\r\nnot been far from loving him from the beginning. I have bought a pair of\r\nvases to send them; and I expect that Miss Lucretia Knowles will say,\r\nwhen she learns how much they cost, that I was very extravagant. Not\r\nthat Lu is close or stingy at all; but she has promised to wait until I\r\nhave made a start in life, and is naturally impatient for me to get on\r\nas rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\n     FRANK PARKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOOD-THRUSH AT SUNSET.\r\n\r\n\r\nLover of solitude,\r\n  Poet and priest of nature's mysteries,\r\nIf but a step intrude,\r\n  Thy oracle is mute, thy music dies.\r\n\r\nOft have I lightly wooed\r\n  Sweet Poesy to give me pause of pain,\r\nOft in her singing mood\r\n  Sought to surprise her haunt, and sought in vain.\r\n\r\nAnd thou art shy as she,\r\n  But mortal, or I had not found thy shrine,\r\nTo listen breathlessly\r\n  If I may make thy hoarded secret mine.\r\n\r\nThy tender mottled breast,\r\n  Dappled the color of our primal sod,\r\nNow quick and song-possessed,\r\n  Doth seem to hold the very joy of God,--\r\n\r\nJoy hid from mortal quest\r\n  Of bosky loves on silver-moonéd eves,\r\nAnd the high-hearted best\r\n  That swells thy throat with joy among the leaves.\r\n\r\nLike the Muezzin's call\r\n  From some high minaret when day is done,\r\nAmong the beeches tall\r\n  Thy voice proclaims, \"There is no God but one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd but one Beauty, too,\r\n  Of whose sweet synthesis we ever fail:\r\nShe flies if we pursue,\r\n  Like thy swift wing down some dim intervale.\r\n\r\nFor thou art lightly gone;\r\n  Gone is the flute-like note, the yearning strain,\r\nAnd all the air forlorn\r\n  Is breathless till it hear thy voice again.\r\n\r\nBut thou wilt not return;\r\n  Thou hast the secret of thy joy to keep,\r\nAnd other hearts must learn\r\n  Thy tuneful message, ere the world may sleep,--\r\n\r\nSleep lulled by many a dream\r\n  Of sylvan sounds that woo the ear in vain,\r\nWhile still thy numbers seem\r\n  To voice the pain of bliss, the bliss of pain.\r\n\r\n     MARY C. PECKHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOREST BEAUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast spring, or possibly it was early in June, I was walking, in company\r\nwith an intelligent farmer, through a bit of heavy forest that bordered\r\nsome fields of corn and wheat, when a golden, flame-like gleam from the\r\nmidst of the last year's leaves and twigs on the ground at my feet\r\nattracted my sight. I stooped and picked up a large fragment of a flower\r\nof the _Liriodendron Tulipifera_ which had been let fall by some\r\nforaging squirrel from the dark-green and fragrant top of the giant tree\r\nnearest us. Strange to say, my farmer friend, who owned the rich Indiana\r\nsoil in which the tree grew, did not know, until I told him, that the\r\n\"poplar,\" as he called the tulip-tree, bears flowers. For twenty years\r\nhe had owned this farm, during which time he had cut down acres of\r\nforest for rails and lumber, without ever having discovered the gorgeous\r\nblossom which to me is the finest mass of form and color to be seen in\r\nour American woods. As I had a commission from an artist to procure a\r\nspray of these blooms for her, I at once began to search the tree-top\r\nwith my eyes. The bole, or stem, rose sixty feet, tapering but slightly,\r\nto where some heavy and gnarled limbs put forth, their extremities lost\r\nin masses of peculiarly dark, rich foliage. At first I could distinguish\r\nno flowers, but at length here and there a suppressed glow of orange\r\nshot with a redder tinge showed through the dusky gloom of the leaves.\r\nLo! there they were, hundreds of them, over three inches in diameter,\r\nbold, gaudy, rich, the best possible examples of nature's pristine\r\nexuberance of force and color. Two gray squirrels were frisking about\r\namong the highest sprays, and it was my good fortune that my friend\r\ncarried on his shoulder a forty-four-calibre rifle; for, though it was\r\ndeath to the nimble little animals, it proved to be the instrument with\r\nwhich I procured my coveted flowers. It suggested the probability that,\r\nif bullets could fetch down squirrels from that tree-top, they might\r\nalso serve to clip off and let fall some of the finest clusters or\r\nsprays of tulip. The experiment was tried, with excellent result. I made\r\nthe little artist glad with some of the grandest specimens I have ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe tulip-tree is of such colossal size and it branches so high above\r\nground that it is little wonder few persons, even of those most used to\r\nthe woods, ever see its bloom, which is commonly enveloped in a mass of\r\nlarge, dark leaves. These leaves are peculiarly outlined, having short\r\nlobes at the sides and a truncated end, while the stem is slender, long,\r\nand wire-like. The flower has six petals and three transparent sepals.\r\nIn its centre rises a pale-green cone surrounded by from eighteen to\r\nthirty stamens. Sap-green, yellow of various shades, orange-vermilion,\r\nand vague traces of some inimitable scarlet, are the colors curiously\r\nblended together within and without the grand cup-shaped corolla. It is\r\nEdgar Fawcett who draws an exquisite poetic parallel between the oriole\r\nand the tulip,--albeit he evidently did not mean the flower of our\r\nLiriodendron, which is nearer the oriole colors. The association of the\r\nbird with the flower goes further than color, too; for the tulip-tree is\r\na favorite haunt of the orioles. Audubon, in the plates of his great\r\nornithological work, recognizes this by sketching the bird and some\r\nrather flat and weak tulip-sprays together on the same sheet. I have\r\nfancied that nature in some way favors this massing of colors by placing\r\nthe food of certain birds where their plumage will show to best\r\nadvantage on the one hand, or serve to render them invisible, on the\r\nother, while they are feeding. The golden-winged woodpecker, the downy\r\nwoodpecker, the red-bellied woodpecker, and that grand bird the pileated\r\nwoodpecker, all seem to prefer the tulip-tree for their nesting-place,\r\npecking their holes into the rotten boughs, sometimes even piercing an\r\nouter rim of the fragrant green wood in order to reach a hollow place. I\r\nremember, when I was a boy, lying in a dark old wood in Kentucky and\r\nwatching a pileated woodpecker at work on a dead tulip-bough that seemed\r\nto afford a great number of dainty morsels of food. There were streaks\r\nof hard wood through the rotten, and whenever his great horny beak\r\nstruck one of these it would sound as loud and clear as the blow of a\r\ncarpenter's hammer. This fine bird is almost extinct now, having totally\r\ndisappeared from nine-tenths of the area of its former habitat. I never\r\nsee a tulip-tree without recollecting the wild, strangely-hilarious cry\r\nof the _Hylotomus pileatus_; and I cannot help associating the\r\ngiant bloom, its strength of form and vigor of color, with the scarlet\r\ncrest and king-like bearing of the bird. The big trees of California\r\nexcepted, our tulip-bearing Liriodendron is the largest growth of the\r\nNorth-American forests; for, while the plane-tree and the\r\nliquidambar-(sweet-gum) tree sometimes measure more in diameter near the\r\nground, they are usually hollow, and consequently bulged there, while\r\nthe tulip springs boldly out of the ground a solid shaft of clear,\r\nclean, and sweetly-fragrant wood, sixty or seventy feet of the bole\r\nbeing often entirely without limbs, with an average diameter of from\r\nthree to five feet. I found a stump in Indiana nearly eight feet in\r\ndiameter (measured three feet above the ground), and a tree in Clarke\r\nCounty, Kentucky, of about the same girth, tapering slowly to the first\r\nbranch, fifty-eight feet from the root.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the Western and Southern States the tulip is generally\r\ncalled poplar, and the lumber manufactured from it goes by the same\r\nname, while in the East it is known as white-wood. The bark is very\r\nthick and cork-like, exhaling an odor peculiarly pungent and agreeable;\r\nthe buds and tender twigs in the spring have a taste entirely individual\r\nand unique, very pleasant to some persons, but quite repellent to\r\nothers. Gray squirrels and the young of the fox-squirrel eat the buds\r\nand flowers as well as the cone-shaped fruit. Humming-birds and\r\nbumble-bees in the blossoming-time make a dreamy booming among the\r\nshadowy sprays. A saccharine, sticky substance, not unlike honey-dew,\r\nmay often be found in the hollows of the immense petals, in search of\r\nwhich large black ants make pilgrimages from the root to the top of the\r\nlargest tulip-trees, patiently toiling for two or three hours over the\r\nrough bark, among the bewildering wrinkles of which it is, a wonder how\r\nthe way is kept with such unerring certainty. I have calculated that in\r\nmaking such a journey the ant does what is equivalent to a man's\r\npedestrian tour from New York City to the Adirondacks by the roughest\r\nroute, and all for a smack of wild honey! But the ant makes his long\r\nexcursion with neither alpenstock nor luncheon, and without sleeping or\r\neven resting on the way.\r\n\r\nThe tulip-tree grows best in warm loam in which there is a mixture of\r\nsand and vegetable mould superposed on clay and gravel. About its roots\r\nyou may find the lady-slipper and the dog-tooth violet, each in its\r\nseason. Its bark often bears the rarest lichens, and, near the ground,\r\nshort green moss as soft and thick as velvet. The poison-ivy and the\r\nbeautiful Virginia creeper like to clamber up the rough trunk, sometimes\r\nclothing the huge tree from foot to top in a mantle of brown feelers and\r\nglossy leaves. Seen at a distance, the tulip-tree and the\r\nblack-walnut-tree look very much alike; but upon approaching them the\r\nsuperior symmetry and beauty of the former are at once discovered. The\r\nleaves of the walnut are gracefully arranged, but they admit too much\r\nlight; while the tulip presents grand masses of dense foliage upheld by\r\nknotty, big-veined branches, the perfect embodiment of vigor.\r\n\r\nIn the days of bee-hunting in the West, I may safely say that a majority\r\nof bee-trees were tulips. I have found two of these wild Hyblas since I\r\nbegan my studies for this paper; but the trees have become so valuable\r\nthat the bees are left unmolested with their humming and their honey. It\r\nseems that no more appropriate place for a nest of these wild\r\nnectar-brewers could be chosen than the hollow bough of a giant\r\ntulip,--a den whose door is curtained with leaves and washed round with\r\nodorous airs, where the superb flowers, with their wealth of golden\r\npollen and racy sweets, blaze out from the cool shadows above and\r\nbeneath. But the sly old 'coon, that miniature Bruin of our Western\r\nwoods, is a great lover of honey, and not at all a respecter of the\r\nrights of wild bees. He is tireless in his efforts to reach every\r\ndeposit of waxy comb and amber distillation within the range of his keen\r\npower of scent. The only honey that escapes him is that in a hollow too\r\nsmall for him to enter and too deep for his fore-paws to reach the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nPoe, in his story of the Gold-Bug, falls into one of his characteristic\r\nerrors of conscience. The purposes of his plot required that a very\r\nlarge and tall tree should be climbed, and, to be picturesque, a tulip\r\nwas chosen. But, in order to give a truthful air to the story, the\r\nfollowing minutely incorrect description is given: \"In youth the\r\ntulip-tree, or _Liriodendron Tulipiferum_, the most magnificent of\r\nAmerican foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a\r\ngreat height without lateral branches; but in its riper age the bark\r\nbecomes gnarled and uneven, while _many short limbs make their\r\nappearance on the stem_\" The italics are mine, and the sentence\r\nitalicized contains an unblushing libel upon the most beautiful of all\r\ntrees. Short branches never \"appear on the stems\" of old tulip-trees.\r\nThe bark, however, does grow rough and deeply seamed with age. I have\r\nseen pieces of it six inches thick, which, when cut, showed a fine grain\r\nwith cloudy waves of rich brown color, not unlike the darkest mahogany.\r\nBut Poe, no matter how unconscionable his methods of art, had the true\r\nartistic judgment, and he made the tulip-tree serve a picturesque turn\r\nin the building of his fascinating story; though one would have had more\r\nconfidence in his descriptions of foliage if it had been May instead of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the tulip-tree, under favorable circumstances, is strong\r\nand rapid, and, when not crowded or shaded by older trees, it begins\r\nflowering when from eighteen to twenty-five years old. The\r\nblooming-season, according to the exigences of weather, begins from May\r\n20 to June 10 in Indiana, and lasts about a week. The fruit following\r\nthe flower is a cone an inch and a half long and nearly an inch in\r\ndiameter at the base, of a greenish--yellow color, very pungent and\r\nodorous, and full of germs like those of a pine-cone. The tree is easily\r\ngrown from the seed. Its roots are long, flexible, and tough, and when\r\nyoung are pale yellow and of bitterish taste, but slightly flavored with\r\nthe stronger tulip individuality which characterizes the juice and sap\r\nof the buds and the bark of the twigs. The leaves, as I have said, are\r\ndark and rich, but their shape and color are not the half of their\r\nbeauty. There is a charm in their motion, be the wind ever so light,\r\nthat is indescribable. The rustle they make is not \"sad\" or \"uncertain,\"\r\nbut cheerful and forceful. The garments of some young giantess, such as\r\nBaudelaire sings of, might make that rustling as she would run past one\r\nin a land of colossal persons and things.\r\n\r\nI have been surprised to find so little about the tulip-tree in our\r\nliterature. Our writers of prose and verse have not spared the magnolia\r\nof the South, which is far inferior, both tree and flower, to our gaudy,\r\nflaunting giantess of the West. Indeed, if I were an aesthete, and were\r\nlooking about me for a flower typical of a robust and perfect sentiment\r\nof art, I should greedily seize upon the bloom of the tulip-tree. What a\r\n\"craze\" for tulip borders and screens, tulip wallpapers and tulip\r\npanel-carvings, I would set going in America! The colors, old gold,\r\norange, vermilion, and green,--the forms, gentle curves and classical\r\ntruncations, and all new and American, with a woodsy freshness and\r\nfragrance in them. The leaves and flowers of the tulip-tree are so\r\nsimple and strong of outline that they need not be conventionalized for\r\ndecorative purposes. During the process of growth the leaves often take\r\non accidental shapes well suited to the variations required by the\r\ndesigner. A wise artist, going into the woods to educate himself up to\r\nthe level of the tulip, could not fail to fill his sketch-books with\r\nstudies of the birds that haunt the tree, and especially such brilliant\r\nones as the red tanager, the five or six species of woodpecker, the\r\norioles, and the yellow-throated warbler. The Japanese artists give us\r\nwonderful instances of the harmony between birds, flowers, and foliage;\r\nnot direct instances, it is true, but rather suggested ones, from which\r\nlarge lessons might be learned by him who would carry the thought into\r\nour woods with him in the light of a pure and safely-educated taste.\r\nTake, for instance, the yellow-bellied woodpecker, with its red fore-top\r\nand throat, its black and white lines, and its bright eyes, together\r\nwith its pale yellow shading of back and belly, and how well it would\r\n\"work in\" with the tulip-leaves and flowers! Even its bill and feet\r\nharmonize perfectly with the bark of the older twigs. So the\r\ngolden-wing, the tanager, and the orioles would bear their colors\r\nharmoniously into any successful tulip design.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Alleghany Mountains I have not found as fine specimens of\r\nthis tree as I have in Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. Everywhere the\r\nsaw-mills are fast making sad havoc. The walnut and the tulip are soon\r\nto be no more as \"trees with the trees in the forest.\" Those growing in\r\nthe almost inaccessible \"pockets\" of the Kentucky and Tennessee\r\nmountains may linger for a half-century yet, but eventually all will be\r\ngone from wherever a man and a saw can reach them.\r\n\r\nThe oak of England and the pine of Norway are not more typical than the\r\ntulip-tree. The symmetry, vigor, and rich colors of our tree might\r\nrepresent the force, freedom, and beauty of our government and our\r\nsocial influences. If the American eagle is the bird of freedom, the\r\ntulip is the tree of liberty,--strong, fragrant, giant-flowered,\r\nflaunting, defiant, yet dignified and steadfast.\r\n\r\nA very intelligent old man, who in his youth was a great bear- and\r\npanther-hunter, has often told me how the black bear and the tawny\r\ncatamount used to choose the ample \"forks\" of the tulip-tree for their\r\nretreats when pursued by his dogs. The raccoon has superseded the larger\r\ngame, and it was but a few weeks ago that I found one lying, like a\r\nstriped, fluffy ball of fur, in a crotch ninety feet above ground. \"Our\r\nwhite-wood\" lumber has grown so valuable that no land-owner will allow\r\nthe trees to be cut by the hunter, and hence the old-fashioned\r\n'coon-hunt has fallen among the things of the past, for it seems that\r\nthe 'coon is quite wise enough to choose for the place of his indwelling\r\nthe costliest tulip of the woods. I have already casually mentioned the\r\nfact that the tulip-tree's bloom is scarcely known to exist by even\r\nintelligent and well-informed Americans. Every one has heard of the\r\nmimosa, the dogwood, the red-bud, and the magnolia, but not of the\r\ntulip-bearing tree, with its incomparably bold, dashing, giantesque\r\nflower, once so common in the great woods of our Western and Middle\r\nStates. I have not been able to formulate a good reason for this. Every\r\none whose attention is called to the flower at once goes into raptures\r\nover its wild beauty and force of coloring, and wonders why poems have\r\nnot been written about it and legends built upon it. It is a grander\r\nbloom than that which once, under the same name, nearly bankrupted\r\nkingdoms, though it cannot be kept in pots and greenhouses. Its colors\r\nare, like the idiosyncrasies of genius, as inimitable as they are\r\nfascinating and elusive. Audubon was something of an artist, but his\r\ntulip-blooms are utter failures. He could color an oriole, but not the\r\ncorolla of this queen of the woods. The most sympathetic and experienced\r\nwater-colorist will find himself at fault with those amber-rose,\r\norange-vermilion blushes, and those tender cloudings of yellow and\r\ngreen. The stiff yet sensitive and fragile petals, the transparent\r\nsepals, with their watery shades and delicate washing of olive-green,\r\nthe strong stamens and peculiarly marked central cone, are scarcely less\r\ndifficult. All the colors elude and mock the eager artist. While the\r\ngamut of promising tints is being run, he looks, and, lo! the grand\r\ntulip has shrivelled and faded. Again and again a fresh spray is fetched\r\nin, but when the blooming-season is over he is still balked and\r\ndissatisfied. The wild, Diana-like purity and the half-savage,\r\nhalf-æsthetic grace have not wholly escaped him, but the color,--ah I\r\nthere is the disappointment.\r\n\r\nI have always nursed a fancy that there is something essential to\r\nperfect health in the bitters and sweets of buds and roots and gums and\r\nresins of the primeval woods. Why does the bird keep, even in old age,\r\nthe same brilliancy of plumage and the same clearness of eye? Is it\r\nbecause it gets the _elixir vitæ_ from the hidden reservoir of\r\nnature? Be this as it may, there are times when I sincerely long for a\r\nball of liquidambar or a mouthful of pungent spring buds. The inner bark\r\nof the tulip-tree has the wildest of all wild tastes, a peculiarly\r\ngrateful flavor when taken infinitesimally, something more savage than\r\nsassafras or spice-wood, and full of all manner of bitter hints and\r\nastringent threatenings: it has long been used as the very best\r\nappetizer for horses in the early spring, and it is equally good for\r\nman. The yellow-bellied woodpecker knows its value, taking it with head\r\njauntily awry and quiet wing-tremblings of delight. The squirrels get\r\nthe essence of it as they munch the pale leaf-buds, or later when they\r\nbite the cones out of the flowers. The humming-birds and wild bees are\r\nthe favored ones, however, for they get the ultimate distillation of all\r\nthe racy and fragrant elements from root to bloom.\r\n\r\nThe Indians knew the value of the tulip-tree as well as its beauty.\r\nTheir most graceful pirogues were dug from its bole, and its odorous\r\nbark served to roof their rude houses. No boat I have ever tried runs so\r\nlightly as a well-made tulip pirogue, or dug-out, and nothing under\r\nheaven is so utterly crank and treacherous. Many an unpremeditated\r\nplunge into cold water has one caused me while out fishing or\r\nduck-shooting on the mountain-streams of North Georgia. If you dare\r\nstand up in one, the least waver from a perfect balance will send the\r\nsensitive, skittish thing a rod from under your feet, which of course\r\nleaves you standing on the water without the faith to keep you from\r\ngoing under; and usually it is your head that you are standing on. But,\r\nto return to our tree, I would like to see its merits as an ornamental\r\nand shade tree duly recognized. If grown in the free air and sunlight,\r\nit forms a heavy and beautifully-shaped top, on a smooth, bright bole,\r\nand I think it might be forced to bloom about the fifteenth year. The\r\nflowers of young, thrifty trees that have been left standing in open\r\nfields are much larger, brighter, and more graceful than those of old\r\ngnarled forest-trees, but the finest blooms I ever saw were on a giant\r\ntulip in a thin wood of Indiana. A storm blew the tree down in the midst\r\nof its flowering, and I chanced to see it an hour later. The whole great\r\ntop was yellow with the gaudy cups, each gleaming \"like a flake of\r\nfire,\" as Dr. Holmes says of the oriole. Some of them were nearly four\r\ninches across. Last year a small tree, growing in a garden near where I\r\nwrite, bloomed for the first time. It was about twenty years old. Its\r\nflowers were paler and shallower than those gathered at the same time in\r\nthe woods. It may be that transplanting, or any sort of forcing or\r\ncultivation, may cause the blooms to deteriorate in both shape and\r\ncolor, but I am sure that plenty of light and air is necessary to their\r\nbest development.\r\n\r\nIn one way the tulip-tree is closely connected with the most picturesque\r\nand interesting period of American development. I mean the period of\r\n\"hewed-log\" houses. Here and there among the hills of Indiana, Ohio,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, and the Carolinas, there remains one of those low,\r\nheavy, lime-chinked structures, the best index of the first change from\r\nfrontier-life, with all its dangers and hardships, to the peace and\r\ncontentment of a broader liberty and an assured future. In fact, to my\r\nmind, a house of hewed tulip-logs, with liberal stone chimneys and heavy\r\noaken doors, embowered in an old gnarled apple-and cherry-orchard,\r\nalways suggests a sort of simple honesty and hospitality long since\r\nfallen into desuetude, but once the most marked characteristic of the\r\nAmerican people. It is hard to imagine any meanness or illiberality\r\nbeing generated in such a house. Patriotism, domestic fidelity, and\r\nspotless honesty used to sit before those broad fireplaces wherein the\r\nhickory logs melted to snowy ashes. The men who hewed those logs \"hewed\r\nto the line\" in more ways than one. Their words, like the bullets from\r\ntheir flint-locked rifles, went straight to the point. The women, too,\r\nthey of the \"big wheel\" and the \"little wheel,\" who carded and spun and\r\nwove, though they may have been a trifle harsh and angular, were\r\ndiamond-pure and the mothers of vigorous offspring.\r\n\r\nI often wonder if there may not be a perfectly explainable connection\r\nbetween the decay or disappearance of the forests and the evaporation,\r\nso to speak, of man's rugged sincerity and earnestness. Why should not\r\nthe simple ingredients that make up the worldly part of our souls and\r\nbodies be found in all their purity where nature's reservoir has never\r\nbeen disturbed or its contents tainted? Why may not the subtile force\r\nthat develops the immense tulip-tree and clothes it with such a starry\r\nmantle have power also to invigorate and intensify the life of man? \"I\r\nwas rocked in a poplar trough,\" was the politician's boast a generation\r\nago. Such a declaration might mean a great deal if the sturdy, towering\r\nstrength of the tree out of which the trough was dug could have been\r\nabsorbed by the embryo Congressman. The \"oldest inhabitant\" of every\r\nWestern neighborhood recollects the \"sugar-trough\" used in the\r\nmaple-sap-gathering season, ere the genuine \"sugar-camp\" had been\r\nabandoned. Young tulip-trees about fifteen inches in diameter were cut\r\ndown and their boles sawed into lengths of three feet. These were split\r\nin two, and made into troughs by hollowing the faces and charring them\r\nover a fire. During the bright spring days of sugar-making the young\r\nWestern mother would wrap her sturdy babe in its blanket and put it in a\r\ndry sugar-trough to sleep while she tended the boiling syrup. A man born\r\nsixty years ago in the region of tulip-trees and sugar-camps was\r\nprobably cradled in a \"poplar\" trough; and there were those born who\r\nwould now be sixty years old if they had not in unwary infancy tumbled\r\ninto the enormous rainwater-troughs with which every well-regulated\r\nhouse was furnished. I have seen one or two of these having a capacity\r\nof fifty barrels dug from a single tulip bole. In such a pitfall some\r\nbudding Washington or Lincoln may have been whelmed without causing so\r\nmuch as a ripple on the surface of history.\r\n\r\nBut, turning to take leave of my stately and blooming Western beauty, I\r\nsee that she is both a blonde and a brunette. She has all the dreamy,\r\nlanguid grace of the South combined with the _verve_ and force of\r\nthe North. She is dark and she is fair, with blushing cheeks and dewy\r\nlips, sound-hearted, strong, lofty, self-reliant, a true queen of the\r\nwoods, more stately than Diana, and more vigorous than Maid Marian.\r\n\r\n     MAURICE THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster's \"Moods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA late magazine-article treating of one of America's illustrious\r\ndead--Daniel Webster--alluded to his well-known sombre moods, and the\r\ngentle suasion by which his accomplished wife was enabled to shorten\r\ntheir duration or dispel them entirely.\r\n\r\nOn an occasion well remembered, though the \"chiel takin' notes\" was but\r\na simple child, I myself was present when the grim, moody reticence of\r\nthe great orator converted fully twoscore ardent admirers into personal\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1837, Mr. Webster, in pursuit of a Presidential\r\nnomination, executed his famous tour through the Great West, at that\r\ntime embracing only the States of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nIllinois. The first infant railway of the continent being yet in\r\nswaddling-clothes, the journey was accomplished by private conveyance,\r\nand the bumps and bruises stoically endured in probing bottomless pits\r\nof prairie-mud, diversified by joltings over rude log-ways and intrusive\r\nstumps, were but a part of the cruel price paid for a glittering prize\r\nwhich in the end vanished before the aspirant like fairy gold. At\r\nstations within reach of their personal influence, local politicians\r\nflew to the side of the brilliant statesman with the beautiful fidelity\r\nof steel to magnet: hence he was environed by a self-appointed escort of\r\nobsequious men, constantly changing as he progressed.\r\n\r\n\"Our member\" spared neither whip nor spur, and joined the triumphal\r\nmarch at Chicago. Mr. Webster was then on the home-stretch, and it was\r\nshortly after this date that the incident I describe occurred. It was a\r\ntime of wild Western speculation; towns and cities sprung into being as\r\nbuoyantly as soap-bubbles, and often proved as perishing. Major Morse\r\nwas president of a company which, perceiving a promising site for harbor\r\nand town on the shore of Michigan, where yet the Indian charmed the\r\ndeer, secured a tract of land and proceeded to lay out an inviting town\r\nof--corner-lots. The major's family occupied temporarily a wide log\r\nhouse, with a rough \"lean-to\" of bright pine boards freshly cut at the\r\nmill below. Outside, the dwelling was merely a hut of primitive pattern\r\nnestling under the shade of a tall tree; inside, it presented a large\r\nroom divided by curtains into cooking-and sleeping-apartments,\r\nsurmounted by a stifling loft reached by the rungs of a permanent\r\nperpendicular ladder. Savory odors of wild fowl and venison daily\r\ndrifted up the charred throat of its clay-daubed chimney, and by the\r\nsame route, whenever the rolling smoke permitted, children sitting about\r\nthe hearth took observations of the clouds and heavenly bodies,\r\naccording to the time of day. A narrow passage cut through the heart of\r\nthe old logs led into the fragrant \"lean-to,\" where against the wall\r\nrested a massive sideboard of dark mahogany, its top alight with glitter\r\nof glass and silver, its inmost recesses redolent of the creature\r\ncomforts which the hospitality of the times demanded. Vases and meaner\r\ncrockery overflowed everywhere with the gorgeousness of blossoms daily\r\nplucked from sandy slopes or the verge of the adjacent marsh. Bright\r\ncarpeting kindly hid the splintered floor, and pictures did like service\r\nfor the rough walls, while the whitest of muslin festooned the tiny\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the Occasion, cheerful sunshine filtered through the\r\nquivering leaves of the big tree near the house, glorifying a late\r\nbreakfast-table, around which the family were gathering, when horses\r\ndriven in hot haste were reined up at the door. Stepping quickly forth,\r\nthe major found his hand clasped by \"our member,\" who begged the\r\nhospitalities of the house for the great Daniel Webster and suite, just\r\nat hand. Despite political differences, the desired welcome was heartily\r\naccorded, and with crucified appetites the family retired to give place\r\nto the unbidden guests, who filed into the room bandying compliments\r\nwith their gay host. A kingly head, grandly set above powerful\r\nshoulders, easily marked the man in whom the interest of the hour\r\ncentred. Strangely quiet amid the noisy group, he moved alone, nor waked\r\nresponsive even to his host, until a brighter sally than usual provoked\r\na grim kind of laughter. Then he suddenly aroused himself to new life,\r\njoining with a burst of humor in the pleasantries of the feast. The\r\nunexpected brightness of the cosy room was not lost on Mr. Webster, who,\r\non entering, paused at the threshold and glanced around in an\r\nappreciative manner, while a deep, restful sigh escaped his weary soul.\r\nThe dreary drive through the wilderness lent an added charm to the\r\nlittle oasis of civilized comfort thus encountered in the lonely\r\nbackwoods of a Western quarter-section.\r\n\r\nNews of the distinguished arrival speedily flew among the laborers\r\nrunning the mill and constructing dwellings for the in-rushing\r\npopulation. Tom and Bill of the hammer, and Mike and Patsey of the\r\nspade, alike forsook their tools in order to witness the exit of a hero\r\nfrom the major's door. They even hoped to receive some expression of\r\nwisdom in golden words from lips used to the flow of stirring thought\r\nand burning eloquence. Lounging patiently under the trees, the expectant\r\nmen listened to the clink and clatter of serving and the bursts of\r\nmerriment within. At the conclusion of the breakfast and the subsequent\r\nchat, Mr. Webster asked for his hostess, to whom with great courtesy he\r\nexpressed his sense of \"the kindness extended to the stranger in a\r\nstrange land,\" and, adieus being over, he approached the open door-way,\r\nand looked strangely annoyed at the sight of a double line of\r\nwhite-sleeved stalwart men who stood with bared heads awaiting his\r\nappearance. Then a great _mood_ fell upon the _man_, with\r\nnever a gentle soul at hand to charm it away. Not a feature stirred in\r\nrecognition of the, voluntary homage rendered by the throng of humble\r\nmen,--men controlling the ballots so ardently desired and sought. With\r\nhat pressed firmly over an ominously lowering brow, looking straight\r\nbefore him with cavernous, tired eyes which seemed to observe nothing\r\nwhereon they rested, Webster walked through the hushed lines in grave\r\nstateliness. The crowd was only waiting for a spark of encouragement to\r\nshout itself hoarse in enthusiastic huzzahs. Eyes shone with suppressed\r\nexcitement, and strong hearts swelled with pride in the towering man\r\nwhose fame had surged like a tidal wave over the land. Yet with insolent\r\ndeliberation he mounted the step and seated himself in the waiting\r\ncarriage, giving no sign of having even noticed the flattering\r\ndemonstration made in his honor. The smiles, nods, and hand-clasps\r\nexpected of the chief were lavishly dispensed by his mortified\r\nsatellites, all of which availed not to smother the curses, loud and\r\ndeep, splitting the summer air, as the wheels disappeared in the forest.\r\n\r\n\"Begorra, thin,\" bawled Patsey, \"it's mesilf ut'll niver vote fur this\r\nbig Yankee 'ristocrat, _inne_how. Ef he wuz a foine Irish jintleman,\r\nnow, er even a r'yal prince av the blud, there'd be no sinse in his\r\nairs, bedad!\"\r\n\r\nTom and Bill were less noisy in their just wrath, but it ran equally\r\ndeep: \"He belongs to the party. But when Daniel comes up for\r\noffice--look out! We'll score a hard day's work against him, party or no\r\nparty!\"\r\n\r\nThe major rose to the occasion. Being a bit of a politician and an\r\nold-school Democrat, he could not resist the opportunity presented. With\r\na humorous air he sprang to the nearest stump and improvised an electric\r\nlittle speech which sent the men back to labor, _madder_ if not\r\nwiser voters.\r\n\r\nWith other living witnesses of the events narrated, often wondering over\r\nthe strangeness of the scene of long ago, I am truly glad at the\r\neleventh hour to find the solution of the problem in _moods_,\r\nrather than in a snobbish pride unbefitting the greatness of the man.\r\n\r\n     F.C.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeuds and Lynch-Law in the Southwest.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said and written lately about feuds and lynch-law\r\nin the districts around the lower Mississippi. The reports of recent\r\nlynching there have probably been very much exaggerated; and it would\r\ncertainly be unfair to form a positive opinion about the matter without\r\na thorough knowledge of all the circumstances.\r\n\r\nNo one who visited that part of the country before the war could return\r\nto it now without noticing the higher degree of order and the numerous\r\nevidences of progress. But lynching law-breakers and resorting to the\r\nknife or pistol to settle private disputes were once ordinary\r\noccurrences there, and they were usually marked by a businesslike\r\ncoolness which gave them a distinctive character.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1853-54 I was clerk of a steamer owned in Wheeling. The\r\nsteamer was obliged to wait some time at Napoleon for a rise in the\r\nArkansas River to enable it to pass over the bar at the confluence of\r\nthat river with the Mississippi. Napoleon then had between three and\r\nfour hundred inhabitants, and was considered the worst place on the\r\nMississippi except Natchez-under-the-Hill. Some of the dwellings were of\r\nconsiderable size, and, judging from their exterior, were kept in good\r\norder. They were the residences of the few who belonged to the better\r\nclass, and who, to a certain extent, exercised control over their less\r\nreputable townsmen.\r\n\r\nWe were treated very kindly by the citizens, and they declined any\r\nreturn for their hospitality. We soon noticed that we were never invited\r\nto visit any of them at their dwellings. At their places of business we\r\nwere cordially welcomed, and they seemed to take a great deal of\r\npleasure in giving us information and affording us any amusement in\r\ntheir power.\r\n\r\nHaving some canned oysters among our stores, we twice invited a number\r\nof our friends to an oyster-supper. Although our invitations included\r\ntheir families, none but male guests attended. This, together with the\r\nfact that we rarely saw any ladies on the street, seemed very strange to\r\nus; but we made no comments, for we discovered very soon after our\r\narrival that it would not be prudent to ask questions about matters that\r\ndid not concern us. At church one Sunday night we noticed that all the\r\nladies present--composing nearly the whole of the congregation--were\r\ndressed in black, and many of them were in deep mourning. This gave us\r\nsome idea as to the reason for their exclusiveness. Soon afterward a\r\nmurder occurred almost within my own sight. Two friends were standing on\r\nthe street and talking pleasantly to each other, when they were\r\napproached by a man whom they did not know. Suddenly a second man came\r\nclose to the stranger, and, without saying a word, drew a pistol and\r\nshot him dead. The murderer was instantly seized, bound, and placed in\r\nthe jail.\r\n\r\nThe jail was a square pen about thirty feet high, built of hewn logs,\r\nwithout any opening except in the roof. This opening was only large\r\nenough to admit one person at a time, and was protected by a heavy door.\r\nThe prisoner was forced by his captors to mount the roof by means of a\r\nladder, and then was lowered with a rope to the ground inside. The rope\r\nwas withdrawn, the door securely fastened, and he was caged, without any\r\npossible means of escape, to await the verdict and sentence of the jury\r\nsummoned by \"Judge Lynch.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial was very short. The facts were proven, and the verdict was\r\nthat the murderer should be severely whipped and made to leave the town\r\nforthwith. The whipping was administered, and he left immediately\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nOf course there was a good deal of excitement over this matter, and all\r\nthe male inhabitants collected to talk about it. The discussion extended\r\nto some similar cases of recent occurrence and soon gave rise to angry\r\ndisputes. In a very short time pistols and knives were produced,\r\ninvitations to fight were given, and it seemed that blood would soon be\r\nshed. By the interference, however, of some of the older and more\r\ninfluential citizens, quiet was restored, and no one was injured. We\r\nwere afterward told that there was hardly a man in the crowd who had not\r\nlost a father, brother, or near male relative by knife or pistol, either\r\nin a supposed fair fight or by foul means.\r\n\r\nAt that time the hatred of negroes from \"free States\" was intense, while\r\nthose from \"slave States\" were treated kindly and regarded merely as\r\npersons of an inferior race.\r\n\r\nSome time before our arrival, a steamer belonging to Pittsburg had\r\nstopped at Napoleon, and the colored steward went on shore to buy\r\nprovisions. While bargaining for them he became involved in a quarrel\r\nwith a white man and struck him. He was instantly seized, and would no\r\ndoubt have paid for his temerity with his life if some one in the crowd\r\nhad not exclaimed, \"A live nigger's worth twenty dead ones! Let's sell\r\nhim!\" This suggestion was adopted. In a very short time the unfortunate\r\nsteward was bound, mounted on a swift horse, and hurried away toward the\r\ninterior of the State. He was guarded by a party of mounted men, and in\r\nless than a week's time he was working on a plantation as a slave for\r\nlife, with no prospect of communicating with his relatives or friends.\r\n\r\nOne morning the captain of the steamer and I saw a crowd collect, and on\r\napproaching it we found a debate going on as to what should be done with\r\na large and well-dressed colored man, evidently under the influence of\r\nliquor, who was seated on the ground with his arms and legs bound. He\r\nhad knocked one white man down and struck several others while they were\r\nattempting to secure him. The crowd was undecided whether to give him a\r\ngood whipping for his offence or to send for his master (who lived on\r\nthe other side of the river, in Mississippi) and let him inflict the\r\npunishment. Finally, the master was sent for. He soon appeared, and\r\nstated that he had given his \"_boy_\" permission to come over to\r\nNapoleon, and had also given him money to buy some things he wanted. He\r\nwas \"a good boy,\" and had never been in trouble before, and if the\r\ncitizens of Napoleon would forgive him this time he, the master, would\r\nguarantee that the boy should never visit Napoleon again. The master\r\nalso stated he would \"stand drinks\" for the whole crowd. This gave\r\ngeneral satisfaction. The drinks were taken, and the master and his\r\nslave were enthusiastically escorted to their dug-out on the shore. Much\r\nhand-shaking took place, in which the \"boy\" participated, and many\r\ninvitations were given to both to visit Napoleon again; after which they\r\nrowed contentedly to their home.\r\n\r\n     J.A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Etymology of \"Babe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the latest English etymological dictionary, that by the Rev. W.W.\r\nSkeat, we read under the word _babe_, \"Instead of _babe_ being\r\nformed from the infantine sound _ba_, it has been modified from\r\n_maqui_, probably by infantine influences. _Baby_ is a diminutive\r\nform.\"\r\n\r\n_Maqui_ is Early Welsh for _son_, and those to whom Mr.\r\nSkeat's modified _maqui_ seems absurd will be pleased to find its\r\nabsurdity indicated, if not proved, by a Greek author of the sixth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe following passage in the seventy-sixth section of Damascius's \"Life\r\nof Isidorus\" has escaped the notice of English etymologists generally:\r\n\r\n\"Hermias had a son (the elder of his philosopher sons) by Ædesia, and\r\none day, when the child was seven months old, Ædesia was playing with\r\nhim, as mothers do, calling him _bábion_ and _paidíon_,\r\nspeaking in diminutives. But Hermias overheard her, and was vexed, and\r\ncensured these childish diminutives, pronouncing an articulate\r\nreprimand.... Now the Syrians, and especially those who dwell in\r\nDamascus, call newborn children, and even those that have passed the\r\nperiod of childhood, _bábia_, from the goddess _Babía_, whom\r\nthey worship.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is _bábion_ but the English _baby_, what _bábia_ but\r\nthe English _babies?_ We can hardly suppose that our English words\r\nare derived from Syriac words in use fourteen centuries ago, or that the\r\nlatter were \"modified from _maqui_\" by \"infantine\" or other\r\ninfluences. We are therefore driven to the conclusion that they were\r\nalike \"formed from the infantine sound _ba_,\" unless we accept\r\nDamascius's derivation from _Babía_.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we know no more concerning this goddess than did the\r\nlearned John Selden, who, writing two hundred and twenty-odd years ago,\r\n\"De Dis Syris,\" says, on page 296 of that work, \"I cannot conjecture\r\nwhether _Babía,_ who seems to have been reverenced among the\r\nSyrians as goddess of childhood and youth, is identical with the Syrian\r\nVenus or not, and I do not remember to have met with any mention of this\r\ndeity except in Damascius's Life of Isidorus.\"\r\n\r\nSelden's memory was not at fault: the words _bábion, bábia_, and\r\n_Babía_ occur only in the passage above quoted.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of other evidence than Damascius's own, we may well\r\nquestion whether he has not inverted the etymological relation between\r\nthe goddess and the babies. Most divinities owe their names to the\r\nattributes or functions imputed to them by their worshippers. It seems,\r\ntherefore, more probable that the Syrian protectress of babies owes her\r\nname to the _bábia_ than that they were called _bábia_ in her\r\nhonor. If, however, we accept Damascius's theory of their relation, what\r\nforbids us to conjecture that the goddess's name was itself \"formed from\r\nthe infantine sound _ba_\"? In any case, the little domestic scene\r\nbetween the priggish father and the dandling mother is amusing and\r\ninstructive to parents as well as to etymologists.\r\n\r\n     S.E.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Russian Revolt: its Causes, Condition, and Prospects.\"\r\n  By Edmund Noble.\r\n  Boston: Houghton, Mifflin & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe internal condition of Russia, though a matter of more than\r\nspeculative interest to its immediate neighbors, is not likely to become\r\nwhat that of France has so often been,--a European question. The\r\ninstitutions of other states will not be endangered by revolutionary\r\nproceedings in the dominions of the Czar, nor will any oppression\r\nexercised over his subjects be thought to justify foreign intervention.\r\nEven Polish insurrections never led to any more active measures on the\r\npart of the Western powers than delusive expressions of sympathy and\r\nequally vain remonstrances. In these days, not Warsaw, but St.\r\nPetersburg, is the centre of disaffection, and the ramifications extend\r\ninland, their action stimulated, it may be, to some extent from external\r\nsources, but incapable of sending back any impulse in return. Nihilism,\r\nbeing based on the absence, real or supposed, of any political\r\ninstitutions worth preserving in Russia, cannot spread to the\r\ndiscontented populations of other countries. Even German socialism\r\ncannot borrow weapons or resources from a nation which has no large\r\nproletariat and whose industries are still in their infancy. In the\r\nnature of its government, the character of its people, and the problems\r\nit is called upon to solve, Russia stands, as she has always stood,\r\nalone, neither furnishing examples to other nations nor able,\r\napparently, to copy those which other nations have set. The great\r\npeculiarity of the revolutionary movement is not simply that it does not\r\nproceed from the mass of the people,--which is a common case\r\nenough,--but that it runs counter to their instincts and their needs and\r\nrouses not their sympathy but their aversion. The peasants, who\r\nconstitute four-fifths of the population, have no motive for seeking to\r\noverturn the government. Their material condition, since the abolition\r\nof serfdom, is superior to that of the Italian peasantry, who enjoy the\r\nfullest political rights. As members of the village communities, they\r\nhold possession and will ultimately obtain absolute ownership of more\r\nthan half the soil of the country, excluding the domains of the state.\r\nIn the same capacity they exercise a degree of local autonomy greater\r\nthan that which is vested in the communes of France. They are separated\r\nfrom the other classes by differences of education, of habits, and of\r\ninterests, while the autocracy that rules supreme over all is regarded\r\nby them as the protecting power that is to redress their grievances and\r\nfulfil all their aspirations. The discontent which has bred so many\r\nconspiracies, and which aims at nothing less than the subversion of the\r\nmonarchy, is confined to a portion of the educated classes, and proceeds\r\nfrom causes that affect only those classes. Among them alone is there\r\nany perception of the wide and ever-increasing difference between the\r\nRussian system of government and that of every other European country,\r\nany craving for the exercise of political rights and the activity of\r\npolitical life, any experience of the restrictions imposed on thought\r\nand speech and the obstacles to the advancement and diffusion of\r\nknowledge and ideas, any consciousness that the corrupt, vexatious, and\r\noppressive bureaucracy by which all affairs are administered is a direct\r\noutgrowth of unlimited and irresponsible power. Nor are they united in\r\ndesiring to destroy, or even to modify, this system. Apart from those\r\nwho find in it the means of satisfying their personal interests and\r\nambitions, and the larger number in whom indolence and the love of ease\r\nstifle all thought and aspiration, there are many who believe, with\r\nreason, that the country is not ripe for the adoption of European\r\ninstitutions, that the foundations on which to construct them do not yet\r\nexist, and that any attempt to introduce them would lead only to\r\ncalamitous results; while there is even a large party which contends\r\nthat, far from needing them, Russia is happily situated in being exempt\r\nfrom the struggles and the storms, the wars of classes and of factions,\r\nthat have attended the course of Western civilization, and in being left\r\nfree to work out her own development by original and more peaceful\r\nmethods. No doubt the great majority of thinking people feel the\r\nnecessity for some large measures of reform and look forward to the\r\nestablishment of a constitutional system and the gradual extension of\r\npolitical freedom to the mass of the nation. But there is no evidence\r\nthat the revolutionary spirit has spread or excited sympathy in any such\r\ndegree as its audacity, its resoluteness, and the terror created by its\r\nsinister achievements have seemed at times to indicate. The active\r\nmembers of the propaganda are almost exclusively young persons, living\r\napart from their families, of scanty means and without conspicuous\r\nability. They belong to the lower ranks of the nobility, the rising\r\n_bourgeois_ class, and, above all, that large body of necessitous\r\nstudents, including many of the children of the ill-paid clergy, whom M.\r\nLeroy-Beaulieu styles the \"intellectual proletariat.\" Classical studies,\r\nGerman metaphysics, and the scientific theories and discoveries of\r\nrecent years have had much to do with the fermentation that has led to\r\nso many violent explosions, the universities have been the chief\r\n_foci_ of agitation, and in the attempts to suppress it the\r\ngovernment has laid itself open to the reproach of making war upon\r\nlearning and seeking to stifle intellectual development.\r\n\r\nSuch is the view presented by recent French and English writers who have\r\nmade the condition of Russia a subject of minute investigation. Mr.\r\nNoble deals more in generalizations than in details, and sets forth a\r\ntheory which it is difficult to reconcile with the facts and conclusions\r\nderived from other sources. According to him, Russia is, and has been\r\nfrom the first establishment of the imperial rule, in a state of chronic\r\nrevolt. This revolt is \"the protest of eighty millions of people against\r\ntheir continued employment as a barrier in the path of peaceful human\r\nprogress and national development.\" \"It is not the educated classes\r\nalone, but the masses,--peasant and artisan, land-owner and student,--of\r\nwhose aspirations, at least, it may be said, as it was said of the\r\nearliest and freest Russians, '_Neminem ferant imperatorem_.'\"\r\nBefore the rise of the empire \"the Russians lived as freemen and happy.\"\r\nThey \"enjoyed what, in a political sense, we are fairly entitled to\r\nregard as the golden age of their national existence.\" The _veché_,\r\nor popular assembly, \"was from a picturesque point of view the grandest,\r\nfrom an administrative point of view the simplest, and from a moral\r\npoint of view the most equitable form of government ever devised by\r\nman.\" The autocracy, established by force, has encountered at all\r\nperiods a steady, if passive, opposition, as exemplified in the Raskol,\r\nor separation of the \"Old Believers\" from the Orthodox Church, and in\r\nthe resistance offered to the innovations of Peter the Great: \"in the\r\none as in the other case the popular revolt was against authority and\r\nall that it represented.\" It is admitted that \"among the peasants the\r\nrevolt must long remain in its passive stage.... Yet year by year,\r\npartly owing to educational processes, partly owing to propaganda, even\r\nthe peasants are being won over to the growing battalions of\r\ndiscontent.\" The autocracy is \"doomed.\" \"The forces that undermine it\r\nare cumulative and relentless.\" Its \"true policy is to spread its\r\ndissolution--after the manner of certain financial operations--over a\r\nnumber of years.\" \"The method of the change is really not of importance.\r\nThe vital matter is that the reform shall at once concede and\r\npractically apply the principle of popular self-government, granting at\r\nthe same time the fullest rights of free speech and public assembly.\"\r\nFinally, \"the Tsar and his advisers\" are bidden to \"beware,\" since \"the\r\nspectacle of this frightfully unequal struggle ... is not lost upon\r\nEurope, or even upon America.\"\r\n\r\nThe horrible crudity, as we are fain to call it, of the notions thus\r\nrhetorically set forth must be obvious to every reader acquainted with\r\nthe history of the rise and growth of states in general, however little\r\nattention he may have given to those of Russia in particular. The\r\ninstitutions of Russia differ fundamentally from those of other European\r\nstates. But the difference lies in historical conditions and\r\ndevelopment, not in the principles underlying all human society. No\r\npeople has ever had a permanent government of its own resting solely or\r\nchiefly on force. Wherever autocracy has acquired a firm footing, it has\r\ndone so by suppressing anarchy, establishing order and authority, and\r\nsecuring national unity and independence. Nowhere has it fulfilled these\r\nconditions more completely than in Russia. It grew up when the country\r\nwas lying prostrate under the Tartar domination, and it supplied the\r\nimpulse and the means by which that yoke was thrown off. It absorbed\r\npetty principalities, extinguished their conflicting ambitions, and\r\nconsolidated their resources; checked the migrations of a nomad\r\npopulation, and brought discordant races under a common rule; repelled\r\ninvasions to which, in its earlier disintegrated condition, the nation\r\nmust have succumbed, and built up an empire hardly less remarkable for\r\nits cohesion and its strength than for the vastness of its territory. In\r\na word, it performed, more rapidly and thoroughly, the same work which\r\nwas accomplished by monarchy between the eighth and the fifteenth\r\ncentury in Western Europe. If its methods were more analogous to those\r\nof Eastern despotisms than of European sovereignties, if its excesses\r\nwere unrestrained and its power uncurbed, this is only saying that\r\nRussia, instead of sharing in the heritage of Roman civilization and in\r\nthe mutual intercourse and common discipline through which the Western\r\ncommunities were developed, was cut off from association with its more\r\nfortunate kindred and subjected to influences from which they were, for\r\nthe most part, exempt. To hold up the crude democracy and turbulent\r\nassemblies common in a primitive state of society as evidence that the\r\nRussian people possessed at an early period of its history a beautifully\r\norganized constitutional system; to contend that the most absolute\r\nmonarchy in existence has maintained itself for centuries, without\r\nencountering a single serious insurrection, in a nation whose\r\ndistinguishing characteristic is its inability to endure a ruler; to\r\ntreat the introduction of a totally different and far more complex\r\nsystem of government, the product elsewhere of elements that have no\r\nexistence in Russia, and of long struggles supplemented by violent\r\nrevolutions, as a thing that may be effected without danger or\r\ndifficulty, the \"method\" being \"really not of importance,\"--all this\r\nstrikes us as evincing a condition of mind that can only be regarded as\r\na survival from the period when the theories and illusions of the\r\neighteenth-century _philosophes_ had not yet been dissipated by the\r\nFrench Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A Naturalist's Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago:\r\n  A Narrative of Travel and Exploration from 1878 to 1883.\"\r\n  By Henry O. Forbes, F.R.G.S.\r\n  New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough a long succession of naturalists have done their best to\r\nfamiliarize readers with the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, Mr.\r\nForbes's book is full not only of freshly-adjusted and classified facts,\r\nbut of curious and valuable details of his own discoveries. Even the\r\nbest-known islands of the group are so inexhaustible in every form of\r\nanimal and vegetable life that much remains for the patient gleaner\r\nafter Darwin and Wallace, who found here some of the most striking\r\nillustrations of their deductions and theories, It is well known that\r\nstartling contrasts in the distribution of plants and animals are met\r\nwith in these islands, even when they lie side by side; and in no other\r\npart of the world is the history of mutations of climate, of the law of\r\nmigrations, and of the changes of sea and land, so open and palpable to\r\nthe scientific observer. Mr. Forbes's object seems to have been to visit\r\nthose islands which offer the most striking deviations from the more\r\ngeneral type. His earlier explorations were made alone, but during the\r\nlast eighteen months he was accompanied by a brave woman who came out\r\nfrom England to Batavia to be married to him at the close of 1881. It is\r\npainful to read of the deadly ordeals of climate and the excessive\r\ndiscomforts and privations to which this lady was exposed. Her diary,\r\nkept at Dilly during her husband's absence, while she was ill, utterly\r\ndeserted, and in danger of a lonely and agonizing death, makes a\r\nsingular contrast to the record of Miss Bird and others of her sex who\r\nseem to have triumphed over all the vicissitudes possible to women. To\r\nthe general reader Mr. Forbes's travels in Java, Sumatra, and the\r\nKeeling Islands are far more satisfactory than in those less familiar,\r\nlike Timor and Buru. In the light of the terrible events of 1883,\r\neverything connected with the islands lying on either side of the\r\nStraits of Sunda is of the highest interest. Those appalling disasters\r\nwhich swept away part of Sumatra and Java and altered the configuration\r\nof the whole volcanic group surrounding Krakatoa took place only a few\r\nweeks after Mr. and Mrs. Forbes sailed for home. This widespread\r\ndestruction seemed to the inhabitants the culmination of a series of\r\ncalamitous years of drought, wet, blight, bovine pestilence, and fever.\r\nIt was Mr. Forbes's fortune to be in Java during these bad seasons,\r\nwhich, from combined causes, made it impossible for flowers to perfect\r\nthemselves and fructify. This circumstance was, however, useful to the\r\nnaturalist, offering him an opportunity for experiments in the\r\nfertilization of orchids and other plants. The account of the Dutch\r\ncinchona-plantations, which now furnish quinine of the best quality, is\r\nfull of interest.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbes's visit to the Cocos-Keeling Islands, in the Indian Ocean,\r\ncannot be passed over. He was eager to visit a coral-reef, and this\r\natoll, stocked and planted only by the flotsam and jetsam of the seas,\r\nthe winds, and migrating birds, offers to the naturalist a most\r\ndelightful study; for here, progressing almost under his eyes, are the\r\nphenomena which have made Bermuda and other coral groups. Little as the\r\nKeeling Islands seem to offer in the way of secure habitation, they have\r\na population of some hundreds of people, presided over by their\r\nenergetic proprietor, Mr. Ross, who has planted the atoll thickly with\r\ncocoanut palms. Gathering the nuts and expressing the oil is the chief\r\nindustry of the inhabitants, who are all taught to work and support\r\nthemselves in some useful way. No money is in circulation on the island:\r\na system of exchange and barter with agents in Batavia for necessary\r\nproducts takes its place. This thriving little community has, however,\r\nterrible forces to contend against. Darwin recounts the effects of an\r\nearthquake which took place two years before his visit to the islands in\r\n1836; a fierce cyclone brought ruin and devastation in 1862; and in 1876\r\na terrible experience of cyclone and earthquake almost swept away the\r\nwhole settlement. This was followed by a most singular phenomenon.\r\n\"About thirty-six hours after the cyclone,\" writes Mr. Forbes, \"the\r\nwater on the eastern side of the lagoon was observed to be rising up\r\nfrom below of a dark color. The color was of an inky hue, and its smell\r\n'like that of rotten eggs.' ... Within twenty-four hours every fish,\r\ncoral, and mollusc in the part impregnated with this discoloring\r\nsubstance--probably hydrosulphuric or carbonic acid died. So great was\r\nthe number of fish thrown on the beach, that it took three weeks of hard\r\nwork to bury them in a vast trench dug in the sand.\" Wherever this water\r\ntouched the growing coral-reef, it was blighted and killed. Darwin saw\r\nsimilar \"patches\" of dead coral, and attributed them to some great fall\r\nof the tide which had left the insects exposed to the light of the sun.\r\nBut it is probable that a similar submarine eruption had taken place\r\nafter the earthquake which preceded his visit to the Keeling Islands in\r\n1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Birds in the Bush.\"\r\n  By Bradford Torrey.\r\n  Boston: Houghton, Mifflin & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe like the name of Mr. Torrey's book, which seems to carry with it a\r\npractical reversal of the proverb that a bird in the hand is worth two\r\nin the bush. For although in many ways it is a good and pleasant sign to\r\nnote the increase of amateur naturalists among us, we yet feel a dread\r\nof an incursion of those lovers of classified collections, \"each with\r\nits Latin label on,\" who believe that in gaining stuffed specimens they\r\nmay best arrive at the charm and the mystery of that exquisite\r\nphenomenon which we call bird-life. Mr. Torrey has no puerile ambitions\r\nfor birds in the hand, and a bird in the bush makes to his perception\r\nholy ground, where he takes the shoes from off his feet and watches and\r\nwaits, feeling a delightful surprise in each piquant caprice of the\r\nlittle songster. He tells the story of his experiences and impressions\r\nsimply and pleasantly, often utters a good thing without too much\r\nemphasis, and yet more often says true things, which is more difficult\r\nstill. He is nowhere bookish, although he has read and can quote well if\r\nneed be. He reminds one occasionally of Emerson, oftener of Thoreau,\r\nwhile his method is that of John Burroughs. His most careful studies are\r\nperhaps of the birds on Boston Common and about Boston, but he writes\r\npleasantly and suggestively of those in the White Mountains. One likes\r\nto be reminded that there are still bobolinks in the world, for they\r\nhave deserted many spots which they once favored. There used to be\r\nmeadows full of rocks, in each crevice of which nodded a scarlet\r\ncolumbine, surrounded by grassy borders where wild strawberries grew\r\nthickly, with hedge-rows running riot with blackberry, sumach, and\r\nalder,--all reckless of utility and given over to lovely waste,--that\r\nwere vocal on June mornings with bobolinks, but where in these times one\r\nmight wait the whole day through and not hear a single note of the old\r\nrefrain. Our author finds them plentiful, however, at North Conway,\r\nwhere, as he describes it, their \"song dropped from above\" while he sat\r\nperched on a fence-rail looking at the snow-crowned Mount Washington\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Cruise of the Brooklyn.\r\n  A Journal of the principal events of a three years' cruise in\r\n  the U.

Philadelphia. 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe copious information given on the title-page leaves little to be\r\nsupplied in regard to the subject-matter of this volume. The same\r\nthoroughness is displayed in the narrative and descriptions, as well of\r\nthe incidents of the voyage and the details of shipboard life as of the\r\nhistory, productions, and scenery of the various places visited. They\r\ninclude, of course, no events or operations such as belong to the annals\r\nof naval enterprise or maritime discovery, but, besides the ordinary\r\nphases of service on foreign stations,--the interchange of courtesies\r\nwith the authorities, the routine of duty and discipline, and the\r\nscarcely less regular round of amusements and festivities,--we have\r\ninteresting episodes, such as an account of the observations of the\r\ntransit of Venus at Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, the \"Brooklyn\" having been\r\ndetailed to take charge of the expedition sent out under Messrs. Very\r\nand Wheeler. A visit to some of the ports of Madagascar soon after the\r\nbombardment of Hovas gives occasion for a readable relation of the\r\ninternal revolutions and the transactions with European powers that have\r\ngiven a pretext, if such it can be called, for the French claim to\r\nexercise a protectorate over a portion of the island, the enforcement of\r\nwhich will require, in our author's opinion, \"an army of at least fifty\r\nthousand men.\" Cape Town was a place of stay for several weeks on both\r\nthe outward and the homeward voyage, and in this connection the history\r\nof the South African states and colonies, including the English wars and\r\nimbroglios with the Boers and the Zulus, is given in detail; while the\r\nnecessity for touching at St. Helena furnished an opportunity for\r\nrepeating the tale of Napoleon's captivity, with particulars preserved\r\namong \"the traditions of the old inhabitants, not generally known.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Lieutenant Beehler made good use both of the means\r\nof observation and of the leisure for study afforded by the \"cruise.\" He\r\nwrites agreeably, and seems to have been careful in regard to the\r\nsources from which he has gathered information. The book is beautifully\r\nprinted, and the illustrations are faithful but artistic renderings of\r\nphotographic views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At the Red Glove.\"\r\n  New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\n\"Upon a Cast.\"\r\n  By Charlotte Dunning.\r\nNew York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\n\"Down the Ravine.\"\r\n  By Charles Egbert Craddock.\r\n  Boston: Houghton, Mifflin & Co.\r\n\r\n\"By Shore and Sedge.\"\r\n  By Bret Harte.\r\n  Boston: Houghton, Mifflin & Co.\r\n\r\n\"At Love's Extremes.\"\r\n  By Maurice Thompson.\r\n  New York: Cassell & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the scene of \"At the Red Glove\" is laid in Berne, it is a\r\ntypical French story of French people with French ideas and\r\ncharacteristics, and it is French as well in the symmetry of its\r\narrangements and effects and its admirable technique. In point of fact,\r\nBerne is a city where a German dialect is spoken, but among the lively\r\ngroups of _bourgeois_ who carry on this effective little drama a\r\nprettier and politer language is in vogue. Madame Carouge, whose\r\npersonality is the pivot upon which the story revolves, is a native of\r\nsouthern France, and is the proprietor of the Hôtel Beauregard. Her\r\nhusband, who married her as a mere child and carried her away from a\r\nlife of poverty and neglect, has died before the opening of the story\r\nand bequeathed all his property to his young and handsome wife. \"Ah, but\r\nI do not owe him much,\" the beautiful woman said: \"he has wasted my\r\nyouth. I am eight-and-twenty, and I have not yet begun to live.\" Thus\r\nMadame Carouge as a widow sets out to realize the dreams she has dreamed\r\nin the dull apathetic days of her long bondage. Although she is bent on\r\nlove and happiness, she is yet sensible and discreet, and manages the\r\nHôtel Beauregard with skill and tact, while secluding herself from\r\ncommon eyes. Destiny, however, as if eager at last to work in her favor,\r\nthrows in her way a handsome young Swiss, Rudolf Engemann by name, a\r\nbank-clerk, with whom she falls deeply in love. Everything is\r\nprogressing to Madame's content, when a little convent-girl, Marie\r\nPeyrolles, comes to Berne to live with her old aunt, a glove-seller,\r\nwhose sign in the Spitalgasse gives the name to the story. It would be a\r\ndifficult matter to find a prettier piece of comedy than that which\r\nensues upon Marie's advent. It is all simple, spontaneous, and, on the\r\npart of the actors, entirely serious, yet the effect is delightfully\r\nhumorous. Berne, with its quaint arcaded streets, its Alpine views, and\r\nits suburban resorts, makes a capital background, and gives the group\r\nfree play to meet with all sorts of picturesque opportunities. The story\r\nis told without any straining after climaxes, but with many felicitous\r\ntouches that enhance the effect of every picture and incident. In scene,\r\ncharacters, and plot, \"At the Red Glove\" offers a brilliant opportunity\r\nto the dramatist, and one is tempted to think that the story must have\r\nbeen originally conceived and planned with reference to the stage.\r\n\r\n\"Upon a Cast\" is also a very amusing little story, and turns on the\r\nexperiences of a couple of ladies who, with a longing for a quiet life,\r\n\r\n    The world forgetting, by the world forgot,\r\n\r\nsettle on the North River in a town which, though called Newbroek, might\r\neasily be identified as Poughkeepsie. Little counting upon this niche\r\noutside the world becoming a centre of interest or a theatre of events,\r\nthe necessity of presenting their credentials to the social magnates of\r\nthe place does not occur to these ladies,--one the widow of a Prussian\r\nofficer, and the other her niece, who have returned to America after a\r\nlong residence abroad. They prefer to remain, as it were, incognito;\r\nand, pried; into as the seclusion of the new-comers is by all the\r\ncurious, this reticence soon causes misconstructions and scandals. The\r\npetty gossip, the solemnities of self-importance, and the Phariseeism of\r\na country neighborhood are very well portrayed, and, we fear, without\r\nany especial exaggeration. The story is told with unflagging spirit, and\r\nshows quick perceptions and a lively feeling for situations. Carol\r\nLester's friendship for Oliver Floyd while she is ignorant of the\r\nexistence of his wife is a flaw in the pleasantness; but \"Upon a Cast\"\r\nis well worthy of a high place in the list of summer novels.\r\n\r\nAlthough \"Down the Ravine\" belongs to the category of books for young\r\npeople, the story is too true to life in characters and incidents, and\r\ntoo artistically handled, not to find appreciative readers of all ages.\r\nIn fact, we are inclined to discover in the book stronger indications of\r\nthe author's powers as a novelist than in anything she has hitherto\r\npublished. \"Where the Battle was Fought,\" in spite of all its fine\r\nscenes, had not the same sustained interest nor the same spontaneity.\r\nThe plot of the present story is excellent, and the characters act and\r\nreact on each other in a simple and natural way. The youthful Diceys,\r\nwith the faithful, loyal Birt at their head, are a capital study; and\r\nfrom first to last the author has nowhere erred in truth or failed in\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the ease with which Mr. Bret Harte won his\r\nlaurels, and the belief which all his early admirers shared that here at\r\nlast was the great American novelist, who was to hold a distinctive\r\nplace in the world's literature, he has perhaps not fulfilled\r\nexpectations nor answered the demands upon his powers. The very\r\nindividuality of his work, its characteristic bias, has been, in point\r\nof fact, a hinderance and an impediment. The unexpectedness of his first\r\nstories, the enchanted surprise, like that of a new and delicious\r\nvintage or a wonderful undiscovered chord in music,--these effects are\r\nnot easily made to recur with undiminished strength and charm. However,\r\none may generally find some bubbles of the old delightful elixir in Mr.\r\nHarte's stories, and in this little group of them, regathered, we\r\nbelieve, from English magazines, each is interesting in its way, and\r\neach true to the author's typical idea, which is to discover to his\r\nreaders some heroic quality in unheroic human beings which transforms\r\ntheir whole lives before our eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson on his title-page announces himself as the author of two\r\nnovels, \"A Tallahassee Girl\" and \"His Second Campaign,\" both of which we\r\nread with pleasure, and this impression led us to turn hopefully to a\r\nthird by the same hand. \"At Love's Extremes\" does not, however, take our\r\nfancy. If the author undertook to discuss a complex problem seriously,\r\nhe has failed to make it clear or vital to the reader; and if the\r\nvarious episodes of Colonel Reynolds's life are to be passed over as\r\nmere slight deviations from the commonplace, we can only say that we\r\nconsider them too unpleasant and abhorrent to good taste to be imposed\r\nupon us so lightly. There are also points of the story which seem to\r\nmock the good sense of the reader. Has the author considered the state\r\nof mind of a young widow who has heard that her husband has been\r\nmurdered in a street-brawl in Texas, who has mourned him for years, and\r\nthen, after yielding to the solicitations of a new suitor and promising\r\nto marry him, learns from his own lips that it was his hand (although\r\nthe act was one of self-defence) which sent her husband to his tragic\r\ndeath? Mr. Thompson seems to violate the sanctities and the proprieties\r\nof womanhood in allowing the widow, after a faint interval of shock, to\r\npass over this fact as unimportant. This situation has, of course, its\r\nfamous precedent in the scene in which Gloster wooes and wins the Lady\r\nAnne beside her murdered husband's bier; but that is tragedy, and we\r\nmoderns are, besides, more squeamish than the people of those mediæval\r\ntimes. In this story the situation becomes more logical, even if more\r\nabsurd, after the return of the husband who was supposed to have been\r\nmurdered. With a good deal of effort to show powerful feeling, the\r\ncharacters in the book are all automatons, who say and do nothing with\r\nreal thought or real passion. The vernacular of the mountaineers seems\r\nto have been carefully studied, and is so thoroughly outlandish and so\r\ndevoid of fine expressions that we are inclined to believe it more\r\naccurate than the poetic and musical dialects which it is the fashion to\r\nimpose upon our credulity. But it must be confessed that, with only his\r\nown rude and pointless _patois_ in which to express himself, the\r\nSouthern cracker becomes painfully devoid of interest, to say nothing of\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[001] John Sevier's Memorial to the North Carolina Legislature.\r\n\r\n[002] J.G.M.
