  "content": "The Festival\r\n\r\nBy H. P. Lovecraft\r\n\r\nAuthor of “Dagon,” “The Rats in the Walls,” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Efficiunt daemones, ut quae non sunt, sic tamen quasi\r\n    sint, conspicienda hominibus exhibeant.”--Lactantius.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was far from home, and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me. In\r\nthe twilight I heard it pounding on the rocks, and I knew it lay just\r\nover the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing\r\nsky and the first stars of evening. And because my fathers had called\r\nme to the old town beyond, I pushed on through the shallow, new-fallen\r\nsnow along the road that soared lonely up to where Aldebaran twinkled\r\namong the trees; on toward the very ancient town I had never seen but\r\noften dreamed of.\r\n\r\nIt was the Yuletide, which men call Christmas, though they know in\r\ntheir hearts it is older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than\r\nMemphis and mankind. It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to\r\nthe ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in\r\nthe elder time when festival was forbidden; where also they had\r\ncommanded their sons to keep festival once every century, that the\r\nmemory of primal secrets might not be forgotten. Mine were an old\r\npeople, old even when this land was settled three hundred years\r\nbefore. And they were strange, because they had come as dark, furtive\r\nfolk from opiate southern gardens of orchids, and spoken another\r\ntongue before they learnt the tongue of the blue-eyed fishers. And now\r\nthey were scattered, and shared only the rituals of mysteries that\r\nnone living could understand. I was the only one who came back that\r\nnight to the old fishing town as legend bade, for only the poor and\r\nthe lonely remember.\r\n\r\nThen beyond the hill’s crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the\r\ngloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples,\r\nridgepoles and chimneypots, wharves and small bridges, willow trees\r\nand graveyards; endless labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets,\r\nand dizzy church-crowned central peak that time durst not touch;\r\nceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles\r\nand levels like a child’s disordered blocks; antiquity hovering on\r\ngray wings over winter-whitened gables and gambrel roofs. And against\r\nthe rotting wharves the sea pounded; the secretive, immemorial sea out\r\nof which the people had come in the elder time.\r\n\r\nBeside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose, bleak and\r\nwindswept, and I saw that it was a burying-ground where black\r\ngravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed\r\nfingernails of a gigantic corpse. The printless road was very lonely,\r\nand sometimes I thought I heard a distant horrible creaking as of a\r\ngibbet in the wind. They had hanged four kinsmen of mine for\r\nwitchcraft in 1692, but I did not know just where.\r\n\r\nAs the road wound down the seaward slope I listened for the merry\r\nsounds of a village at evening, but did not hear them. Then I thought\r\nof the season, and felt that these old Puritan folk might well have\r\nChristmas customs strange to me, and full of silent hearthside prayer.\r\nSo after that I did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers,\r\nbut kept on down past the hushed, lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone\r\nwalls to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in\r\nthe salt breeze, and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways\r\nglistened along deserted, unpaved lanes in the light of little,\r\ncurtained windows.\r\n\r\nI had seen maps of the town, and knew where to find the home of my\r\npeople. It was told that I should be known and welcomed, for village\r\nlegend lives long; so I hastened through Back Street to Circle Court,\r\nand across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the\r\ntown, to where Green Lane leads off behind the Market House. I was\r\nglad I had chosen to walk. The white village had seemed very beautiful\r\nfrom the hill; and now I was eager to knock at the door of my people,\r\nthe seventh house on the left in Green Lane, with an ancient peaked\r\nroof and jutting second story, all built before 1650.\r\n\r\nThere were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw from\r\nthe diamond window-panes that it must have been kept very close to its\r\nantique state. The upper part overhung the narrow, grass-grown street\r\nand nearly met the overhanging part of the house opposite, so that I\r\nwas almost in a tunnel, with the low stone doorstep wholly free from\r\nsnow. There was no sidewalk, but many houses had high doors reached by\r\ndouble flights of steps with iron railings. It was an odd scene, and\r\nbecause I was strange to New England I had never known its like\r\nbefore. Though it pleased me, I would have relished it better if there\r\nhad been footprints in the snow, and people in the streets, and a few\r\nwindows without drawn curtains.\r\n\r\n                *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I sounded the archaic iron knocker I was half afraid. Some fear\r\nhad been gathering in me, perhaps because of the strangeness of my\r\nheritage, and the bleakness of the evening, and the queerness of the\r\nsilence in that aged town of curious customs. And when my knock was\r\nanswered I was fully afraid, because I had not heard any footsteps\r\nbefore the door creaked open. But I was not afraid long, for the\r\ngowned, slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that\r\nreassured me; and though he made signs that he was dumb, he wrote a\r\nquaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned me into a low, candlelit room with massive exposed rafters\r\nand dark, stiff, sparse furniture of the seventeenth century. The past\r\nwas vivid there, for not an attribute was missing. There was a\r\ncavernous fireplace and a spinning-wheel at which a bent old woman in\r\nloose wrapper and deep poke-bonnet sat back toward me, silently\r\nspinning despite the festive season. An infinite dampness seemed upon\r\nthe place, and I marveled that no fire should be blazing. The\r\nhigh-backed settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left, and\r\nseemed to be occupied, though I was not sure. I did not like\r\neverything about what I saw, and felt again the fear I had had. This\r\nfear grew stronger from what had before lessened it, for the more I\r\nlooked at the old man’s bland face, the more its very blandness\r\nterrified me. The eyes never moved, and the skin was too like wax.\r\nFinally I was sure it was not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning\r\nmask. But the flabby hands, curiously gloved, wrote genially on the\r\ntablet and told me I must wait a while before I could be led to the\r\nplace of festival.\r\n\r\nPointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left,\r\nthe room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary\r\nand moldy, and that they included old Morryster’s wild “Marvels of\r\nScience,” the terrible “Saducismus Triumphatus” of Joseph Glanvil,\r\npublished in 1681, the shocking “Daemonolatreia” of Remigius, printed\r\nin 1595 at Lyons, and worst of all, the unmentionable “Necronomicon”\r\nof the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius’ forbidden Latin\r\ntranslation: a book which I had never seen, but of which I had heard\r\nmonstrous things whispered. No one spoke to me, but I could hear the\r\ncreaking of signs in the wind outside, and the whir of the wheel as\r\nthe bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning, spinning.\r\n\r\nI thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and\r\ndisquieting, but because an old tradition of my father’s had summoned\r\nme to strange feastings, I resolved to expect queer things. So I tried\r\nto read, and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something I found in\r\nthat accursed “Necronomicon”; a thought and a legend too hideous for\r\nsanity or consciousness. But I disliked it when I fancied I heard the\r\nclosing of one of the windows that the settle faced, as if it had been\r\nstealthily opened. It had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of\r\nthe old woman’s spinning-wheel. This was not much, though, for the old\r\nwoman was spinning very hard, and the aged clock had been striking.\r\nAfter that I lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle,\r\nand was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back\r\nbooted and dressed in a loose antique costume, and sat down on that\r\nvery bench, so that I could not see him. It was certainly nervous\r\nwaiting, and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so. When\r\n11 o’clock struck, however, the old man stood up, glided to a massive\r\ncarved chest in a corner, and got two hooded cloaks, one of which he\r\ndonned, and the other of which he draped round the old woman, who was\r\nceasing her monotonous spinning. Then they both started for the outer\r\ndoor; the woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after picking up the\r\nvery book I had been reading, beckoning me as he drew his hood over\r\nthat unmoving face or mask.\r\n\r\nWe went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly\r\nancient town; went out as the lights in the curtained windows\r\ndisappeared one by one, and the Dog Star leered at the throng of\r\ncowled, cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and\r\nformed monstrous processions up this street and that, past the\r\ncreaking signs and antediluvian gables, the thatched roofs and the\r\ndiamond-paned windows; threading precipitous lanes where decaying\r\nhouses overlapped and crumbled together, gliding across open courts\r\nand churchyards where the bobbing lanterns made eldritch drunken\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nAmid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by\r\nelbows that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and\r\nstomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and\r\nhearing never a word. Up, up, up, the eery columns slithered, and I\r\nsaw that all the travelers were converging as they flowed near a sort\r\nof focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the center of\r\nthe town, where perched a great white church. I had seen it from the\r\nroad’s crest when I looked at Kingsport in the new dusk, and it had\r\nmade me shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment\r\non the ghostly spire.\r\n\r\nThere was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with\r\nspectral shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of\r\nsnow by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having\r\npeaked roofs and overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the\r\ntombs, revealing gruesome vistas, though queerly failing to cast any\r\nshadows. Past the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see\r\nover the hill’s summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbor,\r\nthough the town was invisible in the dark. Only once in a while a\r\nlantern bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to\r\novertake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nI waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway, and till all\r\nthe stragglers had followed. The old man was pulling at my sleeve, but\r\nI was determined to be the last. Then finally I went, the sinister man\r\nand the old spinning woman before me. Crossing the threshold into that\r\nswarming temple of unknown darkness, I turned once to look at the\r\noutside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on\r\nthe hilltop pavement. And as I did so I shuddered. For though the wind\r\nhad not left much snow, a few patches did remain on the path near the\r\ndoor; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eye\r\nthat they bore no mark of passing feet, not even mine.\r\n\r\nThe church was scarce lighted by all the lanterns that had entered it,\r\nfor most of the throng had already vanished. They had streamed up the\r\naisle between the high white pews to the trapdoor of the vaults which\r\nyawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit, and were now squirming\r\nnoiselessly in. I followed dumbly down the footworn steps and into the\r\ndank, suffocating crypt. The tail of that sinuous line of\r\nnight-marchers seemed very horrible, and as I saw them wriggling into\r\na venerable tomb, they seemed more horrible still. Then I noticed that\r\nthe tomb’s floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding,\r\nand in a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of\r\nrough-hewn stone; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly\r\nodorous, that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill, past\r\nmonotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar. It was\r\na silent, shocking descent, and I observed after a horrible interval\r\nthat the walls and steps were changing in nature, as if chiseled out\r\nof the solid rock. What mainly troubled me was that the myriad\r\nfootfalls made no sound and set up no echoes. After more eons of\r\ndescent I saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown\r\nrecesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery. Soon they\r\nbecame excessively numerous, like impious catacombs of nameless\r\nmenace; and their pungent odor of decay grew quite unbearable. I knew\r\nwe must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of\r\nKingsport itself, and I shivered that a town should be so aged and\r\nmaggoty with subterraneous evil.\r\n\r\nThen I saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious\r\nlapping of sunless waters. Again I shivered, for I did not like the\r\nthings that the night had brought, and wished bitterly that no\r\nforefather had summoned me to this primal rite. As the steps and the\r\npassage grew broader, I heard another sound, the thin, whining mockery\r\nof a feeble flute; and suddenly there spread out before me the\r\nboundless vista of an inner world--a vast fungous shore litten by a\r\nbelching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river\r\nthat flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the\r\nblackest gulfs of immemorial ocean.\r\n\r\n                *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFainting and gasping, I looked at that unhallowed Erebus of titan\r\ntoadstools, leprous fire and slimy water, and saw the cloaked throngs\r\nforming a semicircle around the blazing pillar. It was the Yule-rite,\r\nolder than man and fated to survive him; the primal rite of the\r\nsolstice and of spring’s promise beyond the snows; the rite of fire\r\nand evergreen, light and music. And in that Stygian grotto I saw them\r\ndo the rite, and adore the sick pillar of flame, and throw into the\r\nwater handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered\r\ngreen in the chlorotic glare. I saw this, and I saw something\r\namorphously squatted far away from the light, piping noisomely on a\r\nflute; and as the thing piped I thought I heard noxious muffled\r\nflutterings in the fetid darkness where I could not see. But what\r\nfrightened me most was that flaming column; spouting volcanically from\r\ndepths profound and inconceivable, casting no shadows as healthy flame\r\nshould, and coating the nitrous stone above with a nasty, venomous\r\nverdigris. For in all that seething combustion no warmth lay, but only\r\nthe clamminess of death and corruption.\r\n\r\nThe man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the\r\nhideous flame, and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semicircle he\r\nfaced. At certain stages of the ritual they did groveling obeisance,\r\nespecially when he held above his head that abhorrent “Necronomicon”\r\nhe had taken with him; and I shared all the obeisances because I had\r\nbeen summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers. Then\r\nthe old man made a signal to the half-seen flute-player in the\r\ndarkness, which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce\r\nlouder drone in another key; precipitating as it did so a horror\r\nunthinkable and unexpected. At this horror I sank nearly to the\r\nlichened earth, transfixed with a dread not of this nor any world, but\r\nonly of the mad spaces between the stars.\r\n\r\nOut of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that\r\ncold flame, out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river\r\nrolled uncanny, unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped rhythmically a\r\nhorde of tame, trained, hybrid winged things that no sound eye could\r\never wholly grasp, or sound brain ever wholly remember. They were not\r\naltogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats,\r\nnor decomposed human beings, but something I cannot and must not\r\nrecall. They flopped limply along, half with their webbed feet and\r\nhalf with their membranous wings; and as they reached the throng of\r\ncelebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them, and rode off\r\none by one along the reaches of that unlighted river, into pits and\r\ngalleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and\r\nundiscoverable cataracts.\r\n\r\nThe old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man\r\nremained only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an\r\nanimal and ride like the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet that\r\nthe amorphous flute-player had rolled out of sight, but that two of\r\nthe beasts were patiently standing by. As I hung back, the old man\r\nproduced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy\r\nof my fathers who had founded the Yule worship in this ancient place;\r\nthat it had been decreed I should come back; and that the most secret\r\nmysteries were yet to be performed. He wrote this in a very ancient\r\nhand, and when I still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal\r\nring and a watch, both with my family arms, to prove that he was what\r\nhe said. But it was a hideous proof, because I knew from old papers that\r\nthat watch had been buried with my great-great-great-great-grandfather\r\nin 1698.\r\n\r\nPresently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family\r\nresemblance in his face, but I only shuddered, because I was sure that\r\nthe face was merely a devilish waxen mask. The flopping animals were\r\nnow scratching restlessly at the lichens, and I saw that the old man\r\nwas nearly as restless himself. When one of the things began to waddle\r\nand edge away, he turned quickly to stop it; so that the suddenness of\r\nhis motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his\r\nhead. And then, because that nightmare’s position barred me from the\r\nstone staircase down which we had come, I flung myself into the oily\r\nunderground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea;\r\nflung myself into that putrescent juice of earth’s inner horrors\r\nbefore the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the\r\ncharnel legions these pest-gulfs might conceal.\r\n\r\n                *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the hospital they told me I had been found half-frozen in Kingsport\r\nHarbor at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to\r\nsave me. They told me I had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the\r\nnight before, and fallen over the cliffs at Orange Point--a thing they\r\ndeducted from prints found in the snow. There was nothing I could say,\r\nbecause everything was wrong. Everything was wrong, with the broad\r\nwindow showing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was\r\nancient, and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below.\r\nThey insisted that this was Kingsport, and I could not deny it.\r\n\r\nWhen I went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old\r\nchurchyard on Central Hill, they sent me to St. Mary’s Hospital in\r\nArkham, where I could have better care. I liked it there, for the\r\ndoctors were broadminded, and even lent me their influence in\r\nobtaining the carefully sheltered copy of Alhazred’s objectionable\r\n“Necronomicon” from the library of Miskatonic University. They said\r\nsomething about a “psychosis,” and agreed that I had better get my\r\nharassing obsessions off my mind.\r\n\r\nSo I read again that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because it\r\nwas indeed not new to me. I had seen it before, let footprints tell\r\nwhat they might; and where it was I had seen it were best forgotten.\r\nThere was no one--in waking hours--who could remind me of it; but my\r\ndreams are filled with terror, because of phrases I dare not quote. I\r\ndare quote only one paragraph, put into such English as I can make\r\nfrom the awkward Low Latin.\r\n\r\n“The nethermost caverns,” wrote the mad Arab, “are not for the\r\nfathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and\r\nterrific. Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly\r\nbodied, and evil the mind that is held by no head. Wisely did Ibn\r\nSchacabac say that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and\r\nhappy the town at night whose wizards are all in ashes. For it is of\r\nold rumor that the soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his\r\ncharnel clay, but fats and instructs _the very worm that gnaws_; till\r\nout of corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers of\r\nearth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it. Great\r\nholes secretly are digged where earth’s pores ought to suffice, and\r\nthings have learnt to walk that ought to crawl.”\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: This story appeared in the January 1925 issue of\r\nWeird Tales Magazine.]",
