No other one man so truly represented\r\nthe dawn of the industrial era,--the grapple of the pioneer with the\r\ncrudities of a new country, the replacing of muscle with machinery, and\r\nthe establishment of better ways and better times in farm and city\r\nalike. Beginning exactly one hundred years ago, the life of McCormick\r\nspanned the heroic period of our industrial advancement, when great\r\nthings were done by great individuals. To know McCormick is to know what\r\ntype of man it was who created the United States of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. And now that a new century has arrived, with a new type of\r\nbusiness development, it may be especially instructive to review a life\r\nthat was so structural and so fundamental.\r\n\r\nAs Professor Simon Newcomb has observed, \"It is impressive to think how\r\nfew men we should have had to remove from the earth during the past\r\nthree centuries to have stopped the advance of our civilization.\" From\r\nthis point of view, there are few, if any, who will appear to be more\r\nindispensable than McCormick. He was not brilliant. He was not\r\npicturesque. He was no caterer for fame or favor. But he was as\r\nnecessary as bread. He fed his country as truly as Washington created it\r\nand Lincoln preserved it. He abolished our agricultural peasantry so\r\neffectively that we have had to import our muscle from foreign countries\r\never since. And he added an immense province to the new empire of mind\r\nover matter, the expansion of which has been and is now the highest and\r\nmost important of all human endeavors.\r\n\r\nAs the master builder of the modern business of manufacturing farm\r\nmachinery, McCormick set in motion so many forces of human betterment\r\nthat the fruitfulness of his life can never be fully told. There are\r\nto-day in all countries more than one hundred thousand patents for\r\ninventions that were meant to lighten the labor of the farmer. And the\r\ncereal crop of the world has risen with incredible gains, until this\r\nyear its value will be not far from ten thousand millions of\r\ndollars,--very nearly the equivalent of all the gold in coin and jewelry\r\nand bullion.\r\n\r\nSo, if there is not power and fascination in this story, it will be the\r\nfault of the story-teller, and not of his theme. The story itself is\r\ndestined to be told and retold. It cannot be forgotten, because it is\r\none of those rare life-histories that blazon out the peculiar genius of\r\nthe nation under the stress of a new experience. As it is passed on from\r\ngeneration to generation, it may finally be polished into an Epic of the\r\nWheat,--the tale of Man's long wrestle with Famine, and how he won at\r\nlast by creating a world-wide system for the production and distribution\r\nof the Bread.\r\n\r\n    H.

Into this year came Poe, Blackie, and\r\nTennyson, the poet laureates of America, Scotland, and England; Chopin\r\nand Mendelssohn, the apostles of sweeter music; Lincoln, who kept the\r\nUnited States united; Baron Haussemann, the beautifier of Paris;\r\nProudhon, the prophet of communism; Lord Houghton, who did much in\r\nscience, and Darwin, who did most; FitzGerald, who made known the\r\nliterature of Persia; Bonar, who wrote hymns; Kinglake, who wrote\r\nhistories; Holmes, who wrote sentiment and humor; Gladstone, who\r\nennobled the politics of the British empire; and McCormick, who gave the\r\nworld cheap bread, and whose life-story is now set before us in the\r\nfollowing pages.\r\n\r\nNone of these eminent men, except Lincoln, began life in as remote and\r\nsecluded a corner of the world as McCormick. His father's farm was at\r\nthe northern edge of Rockbridge County, Virginia, in a long, thin strip\r\nof fairly fertile land that lay crumpled between the Blue Ridge on the\r\neast and the Alleghanies on the west. It was eighteen miles south of the\r\nnearest town of Staunton, and a hundred miles from the Atlantic coast.\r\nThe whole region was a quiet, industrious valley, whose only local\r\ntragedy had been an Indian massacre in 1764, in which eighty white\r\nsettlers had been put to death by a horde of savages.\r\n\r\nThe older men and women of 1809 could remember when wolf-heads were used\r\nas currency; and when the stocks and the ducking stool stood in the main\r\nstreet of Staunton. Also, they were fond of telling how the farmers of\r\nthe valley, when they heard that the Revolution had begun in\r\nMassachusetts, carted 137 barrels of flour to Frederick, one hundred\r\nmiles north, and ordered it sent forthwith to the needy people of\r\nBoston. This grew to be one of the most popular tales of local\r\nhistory,--an epic of the patriots who fought for liberty, not with\r\ngunpowder but flour.\r\n\r\nBy 1809 the more severe hardships of the pioneer days had been overcome.\r\nHouses were still built of logs, but they were larger and better\r\nfurnished. In the McCormick homestead, for instance, there was a parlor\r\nwhich had the dignity of mahogany furniture, and the luxury of books and\r\na carpet. The next-door county of Augusta boasted of thirteen carriages\r\nand one hundred and two cut-glass decanters. And the chief sources of\r\nexcitement had evolved from Indian raids and wolf-hunts into elections,\r\nlotteries, and litigation.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps fortunate for the child McCormick that he was born in\r\nsuch an out-of-the-way nook, for the reason that in 1809 almost the\r\nwhole civilized world was in a turmoil. In England mobs of unemployed\r\nmen and women were either begging for bread or smashing the new machines\r\nthat had displaced them in the factories. In the Tyrol, sixty thousand\r\npeasants, who had revolted from the intolerable tyranny of the\r\nBavarians, were being beaten into submission. In Servia, the Turks were\r\nstriking down a rebellion by building a pyramid of thirty thousand\r\nServian skulls,--a tragic pile which may still be seen midway between\r\nBelgrade and Stamboul. Sweden was being trampled under the feet of a\r\nRussian army; and the greater part of Holland, Austria, Germany, and\r\nSpain had been so scourged by the hosts of Napoleon as to be one vast\r\nshamble of misery and blood.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there was no war, but there certainly did exist an\r\nabnormal surplus of adversity. The young republic, which had fewer white\r\ncitizens than the two cities of New York and Chicago possess to-day, was\r\nbeing terrorized in the West by the Indian Confederacy of Tecumseh; and\r\nits flag had been flouted by England, France, and the Barbary pirates.\r\nIts total revenue was much less than the value of last year's hay crop\r\nin Vermont. It was desperately poor, with its people housed for the most\r\npart in log cabins, clothed in homespun, and fed every winter on food\r\nthat would cause a riot in any modern penitentiary.\r\n\r\nThere was no such thing known, except in dreams, as the use of machinery\r\nin the cultivation of the soil. The average farmer, in all civilized\r\ncountries, believed that an iron plow would poison the soil. He planted\r\nhis grain by the phases of the moon; kept his cows outside in winter;\r\nand was unaware that glanders was contagious. Joseph Jenks, of Lynn, had\r\ninvented the scythe in 1655, \"for the more speedy cutting of grasse\";\r\nand a Scotchman had improved it into the grain cradle. But the greater\r\npart of the grain in all countries was, a century ago, being cut by the\r\nsame little hand sickle that the Egyptians had used on the banks of the\r\nNile and the Babylonians in the valley of the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nThe wise public men of that day knew how urgent was the need of better\r\nmethods in farming. Fifteen years before, George Washington had said,\r\n\"I know of no pursuit in which more real and important service can be\r\nrendered to any country than by improving its agriculture.\" But it was\r\ngenerally believed that the task was hopeless; and any effort to\r\nencourage inventors had hitherto been a failure. An English society, for\r\ninstance, had offered a prize of one hundred and fifty dollars for a\r\nbetter method of reaping grain, and the only answer it received was from\r\na traveller who had seen the Belgians reaping with a two-foot scythe and\r\na cane; the cane was used to push the grain back before it was cut, so\r\nthat more grain could be cut at a blow. As to whether or not he received\r\nthe prize for this discovery is not recorded.\r\n\r\nThe city of New York in 1809 was not larger than the Des Moines of\r\nto-day, and not nearly so well built and prosperous. Two miles to the\r\nnorth of it, through swamps and forests, lay the clearing that is now\r\nknown as Herald Square. There was no street railway, nor cooking range,\r\nnor petroleum, nor savings bank, nor friction match, nor steel plow,\r\nneither in New York nor anywhere else. And the one pride and boast of\r\nthe city was Fulton's new steamboat, the _Clermont_, which could waddle\r\nto Albany and back, if all went well, in three days or possibly four.\r\n\r\nAs for social conditions, they were so hopelessly bad that few had the\r\nheart to improve them. The house that we call a \"slum tenement\" to-day\r\nwould have made an average American hotel in 1809. Rudeness and rowdyism\r\nwere the rule. Drunkenness was as common, and as little considered, as\r\nsmoking is at the present time; there was no organized opposition to it\r\nof any kind, except one little temperance society at Saratoga. There\r\nwere no sewers, and much of the water was drawn from putrid wells. Many\r\nfaces were pitted with small-pox. Cholera and yellow jack or strange\r\nhunger-fevers cut wide swaths of death again and again among the\r\nhelpless people. There was no science, of course, and no sanitation, and\r\nno medical knowledge except a medley of drastic measures which were apt\r\nto be as dangerous as the disease.\r\n\r\nThe desperate struggle to survive appears to have been so intense that\r\nthere was little or no social sympathy. There was very little pity for\r\nthe pauper,--he was auctioned off to be half starved by the lowest\r\nbidder; and for the criminal there was no feeling except the utmost\r\nrepulsion and abhorrence. It was found, for instance, in 1809, that in\r\nthe jail in New York there were seventy-two women, white and black, in\r\none chairless, bedless room, all kept in order by a keeper with a whip,\r\nand fed like cattle from a tub of mush, some eating with spoons and some\r\nwith cups and some with their unwashed hands. And the men's room of that\r\njail, says this report, \"is worse than the women's.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, in 1809, the chronic quantity of misery had been terribly\r\naugmented by the Embargo,--that most ruinous invention of President\r\nJefferson, whereby American ships were swept from the sea, with a loss\r\nto capital of twelve millions a year, and a loss to labor of thirty\r\nthousand places of employment. According to this amazing act of\r\npolitical folly, every market-boat sailing from New Jersey to New\r\nYork--every sailboat or canoe--had to give bail to the federal\r\ngovernment before it dared to leave the dock.\r\n\r\nWhatever flimsy little structure of industry had been built up in thirty\r\nyears of independence, was thrown prostrate by this Embargo. A hundred\r\nthousand men stood on the streets with helpless hands, begging for work\r\nor bread. The jails were jammed with debtors,--1,300 in New York alone.\r\nThe newspapers were overrun by bankruptcy notices. The coffee-houses\r\nwere empty. The ships lay mouldering at the docks. In those\r\nhand-to-mouth days there was no piled-up reserve of food or wealth,--no\r\nrange of towering wheat-banks at every port; and the seaboard cities lay\r\nfor a time as desolate as though they had been ravaged by a pestilence.\r\n\r\nIn that darkest year the hardscrabble little republic learned and\r\nremembered one of its most important lessons,--the fact that liberty and\r\nindependence are not enough. Here it was, an absolutely free\r\nnation,--_the only free civilized country in the world_,--and yet as\r\nmiserable and poor and hungry as though it were a mere province of a\r\nEuropean empire. So, by degrees, there came a change in the American\r\npoint of view,--a swing from politicalism to industrialism. The mass of\r\nthe people were now surfeited with oratory and politics and war. They\r\nbegan to settle down to hard facts and hard work. Instead of declaiming\r\nabout the rights of man, they began to build roads and weave cloth and\r\norganize stock companies. Slowly they came to realize that a second\r\nRevolution must be wrought,--a Revolution that would enable them to\r\nwrite a Declaration of Independence against Hunger and Hardship and Hand\r\nLabor.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1809 the chief topics of interest in American\r\nlegislatures and grocery stores were the blockades, the Embargo, the\r\ntreaties, the badness of Napoleon, the blunders of Jefferson, and the\r\nrudeness of England and France. But after that year the chief topics of\r\ninterest came to be of a wholly different sort. They were such as the\r\ntariff, the currency, the building of factories and canals, the opening\r\nof public lands, the problem of slavery, and the development of the\r\nWest. The hardy, victorious little nation began to talk less and work\r\nmore; and so by a natural evolution of thought the era of George\r\nWashington and Thomas Jefferson came to an end, and the era of Robert\r\nFulton and Peter Cooper and Cyrus Hall McCormick was in its dawn.\r\n\r\nFrom 1810 to 1820 there was a rush to the land. Twenty million acres\r\nwere sold, in most cases for two dollars an acre. Thousands of men who\r\nhad been sailors turned their backs on the sea and learned to till the\r\nsoil. Town laborers, too, whose wages had been fifty cents a day,\r\ntramped westward along the Indian trails and seized upon scraps of land\r\nthat lay ownerless. Nine out of ten Americans began to farm with the\r\nutmost energy and perseverance,--_but with what tools?_ With the wooden\r\nplow, the sickle, the scythe, and the flail, the same rude hand-labor\r\ntools that the nations of antiquity had tried to farm with,--the tools\r\nof failure and slavery and famine.\r\n\r\nSuch was the predicament of this republic for the first seventy-five\r\nyears of its life. It could not develop beyond the struggle for food. It\r\nwas chained to the bread-line. It could not feed itself. Not even\r\nnine-tenths of its people could produce enough grain to satisfy its\r\nhunger. Again and again, until 1858, wheat had to be imported by this\r\nnation of farmers. So, as we now look back over those basic years, from\r\nthe summit of the twentieth century, we can see how timely an event it\r\nwas that in the dark year 1809 the inventor of the Reaper was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE McCORMICK HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nIF we wish to solve the riddle of the Reaper,--to know why it was not\r\ninvented in any of the older nations that rose to greatness and perished\r\nin so many instances for lack of bread,--we can find the key to the\r\nanswer in the home and the ancestry of the McCormicks. We shall see that\r\nthe family into which he was born represented in the highest degree that\r\nnew species of farmer,--self-reliant, studious, enterprising, and\r\ninventive,--which was developed in the pioneer period of American\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nRobert McCormick, the father of Cyrus, was in his most prosperous days\r\nthe owner of four farms, having in all 1,800 acres. But his acres were\r\nonly one-half of his interests. He owned as well two grist-mills, two\r\nsawmills, a smelting-furnace, a distillery, and a blacksmith-shop. He\r\ndid much more than till the soil. He hammered iron and shaped wood, and\r\ndid both well, as those can testify who have seen an iron crane and\r\nwalnut cabinet that were made by his hands. More than this, he invented\r\nnew types of farm machinery,--a hemp-brake, a clover huller, a bellows,\r\nand a threshing-machine.\r\n\r\nThe little log workshop still stands where Robert McCormick and his sons\r\nhammered and tinkered on rainy days. It is about twenty-four feet\r\nsquare, with an uneven floor, and a heavy door that was hung in place by\r\nhome-made nails and home-made hinges. There was a forge on either side\r\nof the chimney, so that two men could work at the same time; and one\r\nsmall rusted anvil is all that now remains of its equipment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD BLACKSMITH SHOP ON WALNUT GROVE FARM, VIRGINIA\r\n\r\nIn this shop the first practical reaping machine was built by Cyrus Hall\r\nMcCormick in 1831]\r\n\r\nAs for the McCormick homestead itself, there were so many manufacturing\r\nactivities in it that it was literally half a home and half a factory.\r\nShoes were cobbled, cotton, flax, and wool were spun into yarn, woven\r\ninto cloth, and fashioned into clothes for the whole family. The\r\nstockings and mitts and caps were all home-made, and so was the cradle\r\nin which the eight children were rocked. What with the moulding of\r\ncandles, and sewing of carpet-rags, and curing of hams, and boiling\r\nof soap, and drying of herbs, and stringing of apples, the McCormick\r\nhome was practically a school of many trades for the people who lived\r\nunder its roof.\r\n\r\nRobert McCormick was an educated man. He was not at all like the poor\r\nserfs who tilled the soil of Europe. He belonged to the same general\r\nclass as those other eminent farmers,--Washington, Jefferson, Adams,\r\nWebster, and Clay. He was a reader of deep books and a student of\r\nastronomy. Lawyers and clergymen would frequently drive to his house to\r\nconsult with him. And in mechanical pursuits he had an unusual degree of\r\nskill, having been born the son of a weaver and accustomed from babyhood\r\nto the use of machinery.\r\n\r\nHe was a gentle, reflective man, with a genius for self-reliance in any\r\ngreat or little emergency. When a new stone church was built, and he\r\nfound that his pew was so dark that he could not see to read the hymns,\r\nhe promptly cut a small window in the wall,--a peculiarity which is\r\nstill pointed out to visitors. On another occasion, with this same\r\nspirit of resourcefulness, he drove the spectre of yellow fever from\r\nthe home. This dreaded disease was gathering in a full harvest in the\r\nfarm-houses of the county. It had cut down three of Mrs. McCormick's\r\nfamily,--her father, mother, and brother,--and had swung its fatal\r\nscythe toward the boy Cyrus, who was then five years of age. When the\r\ndoctor was called, he insisted that the child should be bled. \"But you\r\nbled all the others, and they died,\" said Robert McCormick quietly;\r\n\"I'll have no more bleedings.\" No remedy for yellow fever, except\r\nbleeding, was known to the doctors of a century ago, so Robert McCormick\r\nat once invented a remedy. He devised a treatment of hot baths, hot\r\nteas, and bitter herbs; and Cyrus was rescued from the fever and\r\nrestored to perfect health.\r\n\r\nSuch a man as Robert McCormick would have been practically impossible in\r\nany other country at that time. There, in that isolated hollow of the\r\nVirginian mountains, he was a citizen of a free country. His vote had\r\nhelped to make Thomas Jefferson President. He was a proprietor, not a\r\nserf nor a tenant. He was not compelled to divide up every cord of wood\r\nand bushel of wheat with a king or a landlord. Whatever he earned was\r\nhis own. He was an American; and thus, in the endless chain of cause and\r\neffect, we can trace the origin of the Reaper back, if we wish, to\r\nGeorge Washington and Christopher Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe whole spirit of the young republic pushed towards the invention of\r\nlabor-saving machinery,--towards replacing the hoe with the steel plow,\r\nthe needle with the sewing-machine, the puddling-furnace with the\r\nBessemer converter, the sickle with the Reaper. And it is fair to say\r\nthat the social forces that represented the American spirit were focused\r\nto a remarkable degree in the home in which Cyrus H. McCormick had his\r\nbirth and his education.\r\n\r\nThere was another contributing influence, too, in the making of\r\nMcCormick,--the fact that the blood of his father and mother came to him\r\nin a pure strain of Scotch-Irish. It was this inheritance that endowed\r\nhim with the tenacity and unconquerable resiliency that enabled him not\r\nonly to invent a new machine, but to create a new industry and hold\r\nfast to it against all comers.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch-Irish! The full story of what the United States owes to this\r\nfire-hardened race has never yet been told,--it is a tale that will some\r\nday be expanded into a fascinating volume of American history. It is not\r\npossible to understand either the character or the success of McCormick\r\nwithout knowing the Scotch-Irish influences that shaped him.\r\n\r\nThe one man who did more to launch the Scotch-Irish on their conquering\r\nway, so it appears, was John Knox. This preacher-statesman, \"who never\r\nfeared the face of man,\" forced Queen Mary from her throne, and\r\nestablished self-government and a pure religion in Scotland, about\r\nseventy-five years after the discovery of America. This brought English\r\narmies down upon the Scotch, and for very nearly two centuries the\r\nstruggle was bitter and desperate, the Scotch refusing to compromise or\r\nto bate one jot or tittle of a covenant which many of them had signed\r\nwith their blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD McCORMICK HOMESTEAD, WALNUT GROVE FARM,\r\nROCKBRIDGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA]\r\n\r\nAt the height of this conflict, about 300,000 of these Scotch\r\nCovenanters left their ravaged country and set out in a fleet of little\r\nvessels for the north of Ireland. Here they settled in the barren and\r\nboggy province of Ulster, and presto! in the course of two generations\r\nUlster became the most prosperous, moral, and intelligent section of the\r\nBritish empire. Its people were, beyond a doubt, the best educated\r\nmasses of that period, either in Great Britain or anywhere else. They\r\nwere the most skilful of farmers. They wove woollen cloth and the finest\r\nof linen. They built schools and churches and factories. But in 1698,\r\nthe English Parliament, jealous of such progressiveness, passed laws\r\nagainst their manufacturing, and Ulster was overrun, as Scotland had\r\nbeen, with the police and the soldiery of England.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch-Irish fought, of course, even against such odds. They had\r\nnever learned how to submit. But as the devastation of Ulster continued,\r\nthey resolved to do as their great-grandfathers had done,--emigrate to a\r\nnew country. They had heard good reports of America, through several of\r\ntheir leaders who had been banished there by the British government. So\r\nthey packed up their movable property, and set out across the wide\r\nuncharted Atlantic Ocean in an exodus for liberty of industry and\r\nliberty of conscience.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1776 there were more than 500,000 of the Scotch-Irish in\r\nthis country. They went first across the Alleghanies, into the new lands\r\nof western Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Texas. Beyond all\r\nquestion, they were the hardiest and ablest founders of the republic.\r\nThey dissolved the rule of the Cavaliers in Virginia; and in the little\r\nhamlet of Mecklenburg they planned the first defiance of Great Britain\r\nand struck the key-note of the Revolution. They gave Washington\r\nthirty-nine of his generals, three out of four members of his cabinet,\r\nand three out of five judges of the first Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nOf all classes of settlers in the thirteen colonies, they were the best\r\nprepared and most willing for the struggle with England, for the reason\r\nthat they had begun to fight for liberty two hundred and fifty years\r\nbefore the battle of Bunker Hill. They were not amateurs in the work of\r\nrevolution. They were veterans. And so, because they were pioneers and\r\npatriots by nature and inheritance, the Scotch-Irish became, in the\r\nwords of John Fiske, \"the main strength of our American democracy.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, they were pathfinders in industry as well as in the matter of\r\nself-government, as many of them had been manufacturers in Ireland.\r\n\"Thousands of the best manufacturers and weavers in Ulster went to seek\r\ntheir bread in America,\" writes Froude, \"and they carried their art and\r\ntheir tools with them.\" In one instance, by the failure of the woollen\r\ntrade, 20,000 of them were driven to the United States. As might have\r\nbeen expected, these Scotch-Irish Americans have produced not only five\r\nof our Presidents, but also such merchants as A. T. Stewart; such\r\npublishers as Harper, Bonner, Scribner, and McClurg; and such inventors\r\nas Joseph Henry, Morse, Fulton, and McCormick. They were possibly the\r\nfirst large body of people who had ever been driven from manufacturing\r\ninto farming; and it was not at all surprising, therefore, that the new\r\nprofession of making farm machinery should have been born upon a\r\nScotch-Irish farm.\r\n\r\nAs for Cyrus H. McCormick, he represented the fourth generation of\r\nAmerican McCormicks. His great-grandfather, Thomas McCormick, quit\r\nUlster in the troublous days of 1735. He was a soldier at Londonderry;\r\nand later became noted as an Indian fighter in Pennsylvania. His son\r\nRobert, who moved south to Virginia, carried a rifle for American\r\nindependence at the battle of Guilford Court-house, North Carolina, in\r\n1781. He was a farmer and weaver by occupation, a typical Ulsterman,\r\nwhose farm was a busy workshop of invention and manufacturing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT McCORMICK]\r\n\r\nOn his mother's side, too, Cyrus McCormick had behind him a line of\r\nbattling Scotch-Irish. She was the daughter of a Virginian farmer named\r\nPatrick Hall, one of whose forefathers had been driven out of Armagh by\r\nthe massacre of 1641. Patrick Hall was the leader of the old-school\r\nPresbyterians in his region of Virginia. So rigid was he in his loyalty\r\nto the faith of the Covenanters, that once when a new minister came\r\nto preach in the little kirk, and lined out a Watts hymn instead of a\r\npsalm of David, Patrick Hall picked up his hat and strode out, followed\r\nby a goodly part of the congregation. He at once built upon his own farm\r\na new church of limestone, in which no such levity as hymn-singing was\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nCyrus McCormick's mother inherited her father's strength of character,\r\nwithout his severity. She was a thorough Celt, impulsive, free-spoken,\r\nand highly imaginative. Judging from the stories about her that are\r\nremembered in the neighborhood, it is evident that she was a woman of\r\nexceptional quality of mind. She was not as studious as her husband, but\r\nquicker and more ambitious. As a girl, she had been strikingly handsome,\r\nwith a tall and commanding figure. She was saving and shrewd, with the\r\nScotch-Irish passion for \"getting ahead.\" She allowed no idle moments in\r\nthe home. If the children were dressed before breakfast was ready, out\r\nthey went to cut wood or weed the garden. She knew the profession of\r\nhousekeeping in all its old-fashioned complexity; and she worked at it\r\nfrom dawn to starlight, with no rest except the relief of flitting from\r\none task to another.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. McCormick came riding by our farm one day,\" said an aged neighbor,\r\n\"at a time when my father and mother were hurrying to save some hay from\r\na coming rain-storm. 'If you don't hurry up you'll be too late,' she\r\nsaid; and then tying her horse to the fence she picked up a rake and\r\nhelped with the hay until it was all in the barn. That's the kind of\r\nwoman she was,--always full of energy and ready to help.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. MARY ANN HALL McCORMICK]\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. McCormick was much more than industrious. She had a fine pride\r\nin the ownership of beautiful things,--flowers and handsome clothes and\r\nsilverware and mahogany furniture. Her flock of peacocks was one of the\r\nsights of the county; and in her later life, when she was for ten years\r\nthe sole manager of the farm, she was accustomed to drive about in a\r\nwonderful carriage with folding steps, drawn by prancing horses and\r\ndriven by a stately colored coachman,--an equipage of so much style\r\nand grandeur that it is still remembered by the neighbors. \"She loved to\r\ndrive fast,\" said one old lady; \"and I was much impressed as a little\r\ngirl with the startling way in which her horses would come clattering\r\nand dancing up to the door.\"\r\n\r\nThus there was in the McCormick home the spiritual and imaginative\r\nelement that was vital to the development of a man whose whole life was\r\na battle against the prejudices and \"impossibilities\" of the world.\r\nCyrus McCormick was predestined, we may legitimately say, by the\r\nconditions of his birth, to accomplish his great work. From his father\r\nhe had a specific training as an inventor; from his mother he had\r\nexecutive ability and ambition; from his Scotch-Irish ancestry he had\r\nthe dogged tenacity that defied defeat; and from the wheat-fields that\r\nenvironed his home came the call for the Reaper, to lighten the heavy\r\ndrudgery of the harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTION OF THE REAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nNot far from the McCormick homestead was the \"Old Field School,\" built\r\nof logs and with a part of one of the upper logs cut out to provide a\r\nwindow. Here the boy Cyrus sat on a slab bench and studied five books as\r\nthough they were the only books in the world,--Murray's Grammar,\r\nDilworth's Arithmetic, Webster's Spelling Book, the Shorter Catechism,\r\nand the Bible.\r\n\r\nHe was a strong-limbed, self-contained, serious-natured boy, always\r\nprofoundly intent upon what he was doing. Even at the age of fifteen he\r\nwas inventive. One winter morning he brought to school a most elaborate\r\nmap of the world, showing the two hemispheres side by side. First he had\r\ndrawn it in ink upon paper, then pasted the paper upon linen, and hung\r\nit upon two varnished rollers. This map, which is still preserved,\r\nreveals a remarkable degree of skill and patience; and the fact that a\r\nmere lad could conceive of and create such a map was a week's wonder in\r\nthe little community. \"That boy,\" declared the teacher, \"is beyond me.\"\r\n\r\nAt about this time he undertook to do a man's work in the reaping of the\r\nwheat, and here he discovered that to swing a cradle against a field of\r\ngrain under a hot summer sun was of all farming drudgeries the severest.\r\nBoth his back and his brain rebelled against it. One thing at least he\r\ncould do,--he could make a smaller cradle, that would be easier to\r\nswing; and he did this, whittling away in the evening in the little log\r\nworkshop.\r\n\r\n\"Cyrus was a natural mechanical genius,\" said an old laborer who had\r\nworked on the McCormick farm. \"He was always trying to invent\r\nsomething.\" \"He was a young man of great and superior talents,\" said a\r\nneighbor. At eighteen he studied the profession of surveying, and made a\r\nquadrant for his own use. This is still preserved, and bears witness to\r\nhis good workmanship. From this time until his twenty-second year, there\r\nis nothing of exceptional interest recorded of him. He had grown to be\r\na tall, muscular, dignified young man. The neighbors, in later years,\r\nremembered him mainly because he was so well dressed on Sundays, in\r\nbroadcloth coat and beaver hat, and because of his fine treble voice as\r\nhe led the singing in the country church.\r\n\r\nEven as a youth he was absorbed in his inventions and business projects.\r\nHe had no time for gayeties. In a letter written from Kentucky to a\r\ncousin, Adam McChesney, in 1831, he says: \"Mr. Hart has two fine\r\ndaughters, right pretty, very smart, and as rich probably as you would\r\nwish; but alas! I have other business to attend to.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW PROVIDENCE CHURCH, ROCKBRIDGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA]\r\n\r\nEver since Cyrus was a child of seven, it had been the most ardent\r\nambition of his father to invent a Reaper. He had made one and tried it\r\nin the harvest of 1816, but it was a failure. It was a fantastic\r\nmachine, pushed from behind by two horses. A row of short curved sickles\r\nwere fastened to upright posts, and the grain was whirled against them\r\nby revolving rods. It was highly ingenious, but the sinewy grain merely\r\nbunched and tangled around its futile sickles; and the poor old\r\nReaper that would not reap was hauled off the field, to become one of\r\nthe jokes of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThis failure did not dishearten Robert McCormick. He persevered with\r\nScotch-Irish tenacity, but in secret. Hurt by the jests of the\r\nneighbors, he worked thenceforward with the door of his workshop locked,\r\nor at night. He hid his Reaper, too, upon a shelf inside the workshop.\r\n\"He allowed no one to see what he was doing, except his sons,\" said\r\nDavis McCormick, who is now the only living person in the neighborhood\r\nwith a memory that extends back to that early period. \"Yes,\" said this\r\nlone octogenarian, \"Robert McCormick was a good man, a true Christian;\r\nand he worked for years to make a Reaper. He always kept his plans to\r\nhimself, and he told his wife that if visitors came to the house, she\r\nshould send one of the children to fetch him, and not allow the visitors\r\nto come to his workshop.\"\r\n\r\nBy the early Summer of 1831, Robert McCormick had so improved his Reaper\r\nthat he gave it a trial in a field of grain. Again it was a failure. It\r\ndid cut the grain fairly well, but flung it in a tangled heap. As much\r\nas this had been done before by other machines, and it was not enough.\r\nTo cut the grain was only one-half of the problem; the other half of the\r\nproblem, which up to this time no one had solved, was how to properly\r\nhandle and deliver the grain after it was cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILES FROM MANUSCRIPT BY MR. McCORMICK GIVING HIS\r\nOWN ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE REAPER]\r\n\r\nBy this time Cyrus had become as much of a Reaper enthusiast as his\r\nfather. Also, he had been studying out the reasons for his father's\r\nfailure, and working out in his mind a new plan of construction. How\r\nthis _new plan_ was slowly moulded into shape by his creative fancy is\r\nnow told for the first time. A manuscript, written by Cyrus H. McCormick\r\nhimself, and which has not hitherto been made public, gives a complete\r\ndescription of the process of thought by which he became the inventor of\r\nthe first practical Reaper. This account, it may be said in explanation,\r\nwas written by Mr. McCormick shortly before the Chicago fire of 1871. It\r\nwas to be published at that time, and was in type when the fire came and\r\nleft not a vestige of the printery. The original manuscript was\r\npreserved; but the labor of rebuilding his factory prevented him from\r\ncarrying out his original design. He wholly forgot his authorship in the\r\ntroubles of his city; and so his own story of his invention lay\r\nuntouched among the private papers of the family for thirty-eight years.\r\n\r\n\"Robert McCormick,\" says this document, \"being satisfied that his\r\nprinciple of operation could not succeed, laid aside and abandoned the\r\nfurther prosecution of his idea.\" He had labored for fifteen years to\r\nmake a Reaper that would reap, and he had failed.\r\n\r\nAt this point Cyrus took up the work that his father had reluctantly\r\nabandoned. He had never seen or heard of any Reaper experiments except\r\nthose of his father; but he believed he saw a better way, and \"devoted\r\nhimself most laboriously to the discovery of a _new principle of\r\noperation_.\"\r\n\r\nHe showed his originality at the outset by beginning where his father\r\nand all other Reaper inventors had left off,--with the cutting of grain\r\nthat lay in a fallen and tangled mass. He faced the problem worst end\r\nfirst. The Reaper that would cut such grain, he believed, must first\r\nseparate the grain that is to be cut from the grain that is left\r\nstanding. It must have at the end of its knife a curved arm--a\r\n_divider_. This idea was simple, but in the long history of harvesting\r\ngrain no one had thought of it before.\r\n\r\nNext, in order to cut this snarled and prostrate grain without missing\r\nany of it, the knife must have two motions: its forward motion, as drawn\r\nby the horses, and also a slashing sideways motion of its own. How was\r\nthis to be done? McCormick's first thought was to cut the grain with a\r\nwhirling wheel-knife, but this plan presented too many new difficulties.\r\nSuddenly the idea came to him--why not have a straight blade, with a\r\nback and forward motion of its own? This was the birth-idea of the\r\n_reciprocating blade_, which has been used to this day on all\r\ngrain-cutting machines. It was not, like the divider, a wholly new\r\nconception; but Cyrus McCormick conceived it independently, and did more\r\nthan any one else to establish it as the basic feature of the Reaper.\r\n\r\nThe third problem was the supporting of the grain while it was being\r\ncut, so that the knife would not merely flatten it to the ground.\r\nMcCormick solved this by placing a row of _fingers_ at the edge of the\r\nblade. These fingers projected a few inches, in such a way that the\r\ngrain was caught and held in position to be cut. The shape of these\r\nfingers was afterwards much improved, to prevent wet grain from clogging\r\nthe slit in which the knife slid back and forth.\r\n\r\nA fourth device was still needed to lift up and straighten the grain\r\nthat had fallen. This was done by a simple revolving _reel_, such as\r\nfishermen use for the drying of their nets. Several of the abortive\r\nReapers that had been tried elsewhere had possessed some sort of a reel;\r\nbut McCormick made his much larger than any other, so that no grain was\r\ntoo low to escape it.\r\n\r\nThe fifth factor in this assembling of a Reaper was the _platform_, to\r\ncatch the cut grain as it fell; and from which the grain was to be raked\r\noff by a man who walked alongside of it. The sixth was the idea of\r\nputting the shafts on the outside, or stubble side, of the Reaper,\r\nmaking it a _side-draught_, instead of a \"push\" machine. And the\r\nseventh and final factor was the building of the whole Reaper upon one\r\nbig _driving-wheel_, which carried the weight and operated the reel and\r\ncutting-blade. The grain-side end of the blade was at first supported by\r\na wooden runner, and later--the following year--by a small wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST PRACTICAL REAPING MACHINE\r\n\r\nBuilt and used by Cyrus Hall McCormick on Walnut Grove Farm, Va., in\r\n1831]\r\n\r\nSuch was the making of the first practical Reaper in the history of the\r\nworld. It was as clumsy as a Red River ox-cart; but _it reaped_. It was\r\nmade on right lines. The \"new principle\" that the youth McCormick\r\nlaboriously conceived in the little log workshop became the basic type\r\nof a wholly new machine. It has never been displaced. Since then there\r\nhave been 12,000 patents issued for reaper and mower inventions; but not\r\none of them has overthrown the type of the first McCormick Reaper. Not\r\none of the seven factors that he assembled has been thrown aside; and\r\nthe most elaborate self-binder of to-day is a direct descendant of the\r\ncrude machine that was thus created by a young Virginian farmer in\r\n1831.\r\n\r\nThe young inventor toiled \"laboriously,\" he says, to complete his Reaper\r\nin time for the harvest of 1831. He was very nearly too late, but a\r\nsmall patch of wheat was left standing at his request; and one day in\r\nJuly, with no spectators except his parents and his excited brothers and\r\nsisters, Cyrus put a horse between the shafts of his Reaper, and drove\r\nagainst the yellow grain. The reel revolved and swept the gentle wheat\r\ndownwards upon the knife. Click! Click! Click! The white steel blade\r\nshot back and forth. The grain was cut. It fell upon the platform in a\r\nshimmering golden swath. From here it was raked off by a young laborer\r\nnamed John Cash. It was a roughly done specimen of reaping, no doubt.\r\nThe reel and the divider worked poorly. But for a preliminary test it\r\nwas a magnificent success. Here, at last, was a Reaper that reaped, the\r\nfirst that had ever been made in any country.\r\n\r\nThe scene of this first \"reaping by horse-power\" was then, and is\r\nto-day, one of unusual beauty. The field is near by the farm-house,\r\nrolling in several undulations to the rim of a winding little rivulet.\r\nIn the centre of the field is a single tree, a wide-branched white oak,\r\nwhich was probably born before the first colonists arrived at Jamestown.\r\nAnd in the background, not more than two miles distant, rise the tall\r\nand jagged crags of the Blue Ridge, twelve sharp peaks flung high from\r\ndeep ravines, on which the lights and shades are incessantly\r\nchanging,--a most impressive staging for the first act of the drama of\r\nthe Reaper.\r\n\r\nThis McCormick farm, having 600 acres of land, is now owned by the\r\nMcCormick family. The whole region has changed but little. Once, and\r\nonce only, the great noisy outside world surged into this quiet\r\nvalley,--when a Union army under General Butler clattered through it,\r\nburning and destroying, and so close to the McCormick homestead that the\r\nblue uniforms could be seen from its front windows. Doubtless, when\r\nfarmers have time to take a proper pride in the history of their own\r\nprofession, they will visit the McCormick farm as a spot of historic\r\ninterest,--the place where the New Agriculture was born. It is no longer\r\na difficult place to reach, as it is now possible to lunch to-day in\r\neither Chicago or New York and to-morrow in the same comfortable red\r\nbrick farm-house that sheltered the McCormicks in 1831.\r\n\r\nSeveral days after the advent of the Reaper on the home farm, Cyrus\r\nMcCormick had improved its reel and divider, and was ready for a public\r\nexhibition at the near-by village of Steele's Tavern. Here, with two\r\nhorses, he cut six acres of oats in an afternoon, a feat which was\r\nattested in court in 1848 by his brothers William and Leander, and also\r\nby three of the villagers, John Steele, Eliza Steele, and Dr. N. M.\r\nHitt. Such a thing at that time was incredible. It was equal to the work\r\nof six laborers with scythes, or twenty-four peasants with sickles. It\r\nwas as marvellous as though a man should walk down the street carrying a\r\ndray-horse on his back.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1832, Cyrus McCormick came out with his Reaper into what\r\nseemed to him \"the wide, wide world.\" He gave a public exhibition near\r\nthe little town of Lexington, which lay eighteen miles south of the\r\nfarm. Fully one hundred people were present--several political leaders\r\nof local fame, farmers, professors, laborers, and a group of negroes who\r\nfrolicked and shouted in uncomprehending joy.\r\n\r\nAt the start, it appeared as though this new contraption of a machine,\r\nwhich was unlike anything else that human eyes had ever seen, was to\r\nprove a grotesque failure. The field was hilly, and the Reaper jolted\r\nand slewed so violently that John Ruff, the owner of the field, made a\r\nloud protest.\r\n\r\n\"Here! This won't do,\" he shouted. \"Stop your horses. You are rattling\r\nthe heads off my wheat.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIELD ON WHICH THE FIRST McCORMICK REAPER WAS TRIED,\r\nWALNUT GROVE FARM, VIRGINIA]\r\n\r\nThis was a hard blow to the young farmer-inventor. Several laborers, who\r\nwere openly hostile to the machine as their rival in the labor market,\r\nbegan to jeer with great satisfaction. \"It's a humbug,\" said one. \"Give\r\nme the old cradle yet, boys,\" said another. These men were hardened and\r\nbent and calloused with the drudgery of harvesting. They worked twelve\r\nand fourteen hours a day for less than a nickel an hour. But they were\r\nas resentful toward a Reaper as the drivers of stage-coaches were to\r\nrailroads, or as the hackmen of to-day are towards automobiles.\r\n\r\nAt this moment of apparent defeat, a man of striking appearance, who had\r\nbeen watching the floundering of the Reaper with great interest, came to\r\nthe rescue.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you a fair chance, young man,\" he said. \"That field of wheat\r\non the other side of the fence belongs to me. Pull down the fence and\r\ncross over.\"\r\n\r\nThis friend in need was the Honorable William Taylor, who was several\r\nyears later a candidate for the governorship of Virginia. His offer was\r\nat once accepted by Cyrus McCormick, and as the second field was fairly\r\nlevel, he laid low six acres of wheat before sundown. This was no more\r\nthan he had done in 1831, but on this occasion he had conquered a larger\r\nand more incredulous audience.\r\n\r\nAfter the sixth acre was cut, the Reaper was driven with great acclaim\r\ninto the town of Lexington and placed on view in the court-house square.\r\nHere it was carefully studied by a Professor Bradshaw of the Lexington\r\nFemale Academy, who finally announced in a loud and emphatic voice,\r\n\"This--machine--is worth--a hundred--thousand--dollars.\" This praise,\r\nfrom \"a scholar and a gentleman,\" as McCormick afterwards called him,\r\nwas very encouraging. And still more so was the quiet word of praise\r\nfrom Robert McCormick, who said, \"It makes me feel proud to have a son\r\ndo what I could not do.\"\r\n\r\nOf all who were present on that memorable summer day, not one is now\r\nalive. Neither in Lexington nor in Staunton--the towns that lay on\r\neither side of the McCormick farm--can we find any one who saw the\r\nReapers of 1831 and 1832. But among those who testified at various\r\nlawsuits that they had seen the Lexington Reaper operate were Colonel\r\nJames McDowell, Colonel John Bowyer, Colonel Samuel Reed, Colonel A. T.\r\nBarclay, Dr. Taylor, William Taylor, John Ruff, John W. Houghawout, John\r\nSteele, James Moore, and Andrew Wallace. There was an old lady, also, in\r\n1885, Miss Polly Carson, who told how she had seen the Reaper hauled\r\nalong the road by two horses, which, she said, \"had to be led by a\r\ncouple of darkies, because they were scared to death by the racket of\r\nthe machine.\" And she expressed the general unbelief of that day, very\r\nlikely, by saying, \"I thought it was a right smart curious sort of a\r\nthing, but that it wouldn't come to much.\"\r\n\r\nCyrus McCormick was far from being the first to secure a Reaper patent.\r\nHe was the forty-seventh. Twenty-three others in Europe and twenty-three\r\nin the United States had invented machines of varying inefficiency; but\r\nthere was not one of these which could have been improved into the\r\nproper shape. Without any exception, the rival manufacturers who rose up\r\nin later years to fight McCormick did him the homage of copying his\r\nReaper; and certainly none of them attempted to offer for sale any type\r\nof machine that was invented prior to 1831.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the pre-McCormick Reapers reveals one fault common to\r\nall,--they were made by theorists, to cut ideal grain in ideal fields.\r\nSome of them, if grain always grew straight and was perfectly willing\r\nto be cut, might have been fairly useful. They assuredly might have\r\nsucceeded if grain grew in a parlor. But to cut actual grain in actual\r\nfields was another matter, and quite beyond their power. None of them,\r\napparently, knew the fundamental difference between a Reaper and a\r\nmower. They did not observe that grain is easy to cut but hard to\r\nhandle, while grass is hard to cut and easy to handle; and they\r\npersisted in the assumption that grain could be reaped by a mower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF BLACKSMITH SHOP IN WHICH C. H. McCORMICK\r\nBUILT HIS FIRST REAPER]\r\n\r\nThese inventors who failed, but who doubtless blazed the way by their\r\nfailures to the final success of McCormick, were not, as he was, a\r\npractical farmer on rough and hilly ground. One was a clergyman, who\r\ndevised a six-wheel chariot, with many pairs of scissors, and which was\r\nto be pushed by horses and steered by a rudder that in rough ground\r\nwould jerk a man's arm out of joint. A second of these inventors was a\r\nsailor, who experimented with a few stalks of straight grain stuck in\r\ngimlet holes in his workshop floor. A third was an actor, who had\r\nbuilt a Reaper that would cut artificial grain on the stage. A fourth\r\nwas a school-teacher, a fifth a machinist, and so on. In no instance can\r\nwe find that any one of these pre-McCormick inventors was a farmer, who\r\ntherefore knew what practical difficulties had to be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe farmers, on the other hand, thought first of these difficulties and\r\nscoffed at the parlor inventors. The editor of the \"Farmer's Register\"\r\nspoke the opinion of most farmers of that time when he said that \"an\r\ninsurmountable difficulty will sometimes be found to the use of\r\nreaping-machines in the state of the growing crops, which may be twisted\r\nand laid flat in every possible direction. A whole crop may be ravelled\r\nand beaten down by high winds and heavy rains in a single day.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the basic reasons, therefore, for the success of Cyrus McCormick\r\nwas the fact that he was not a parlor inventor. He was primarily a\r\nfarmer. He knew what wheat was and how it grew. And his first aim in\r\nmaking a reaper was not to produce a mechanical curiosity, nor to\r\nderive a fortune from the sale of his patent, but to cut the grain on\r\nhis father's farm.\r\n\r\nSo far as the pre-McCormick inventors are concerned, the whole truth\r\nabout them seems to be that a few invented fractional mowers or reapers\r\nthat were fairly good as far as they went, and that most of them\r\ninvented nothing that became of any lasting value. Nine-tenths of them\r\nwere pathfinders in the sense that they showed what ought _not_ to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nVery little attention would have been given them had it not been for the\r\npersistent effort made by rival manufacturers to detract from\r\nMcCormick's reputation as an inventor. This they did in a wholly\r\nimpersonal manner, of course, so that they should not be obliged to pay\r\nhim royalties, and because his prestige as the original inventor of the\r\nReaper enabled him to outsell them among the farmers.\r\n\r\nBut now that the competition of Reaper manufacturers has been tempered\r\nby consolidation, the time has arrived to do justice to Cyrus McCormick\r\nas the inventor of the Reaper. The stock phrase,--\"He was less of an\r\ninventor than a business man,\" which was so widely used against him\r\nduring his lifetime, ought now in all fairness to be laid aside. The\r\nfact is, as we have seen, that he was schooled as a boy into an\r\ninventive habit of mind; and that before his invention of the Reaper, he\r\nhad devised a new grain-cradle, a hillside plow, and a self-sharpening\r\nplow. There is abundant corroborative evidence in the letters which he\r\nwrote to his father and brothers, instructing them to \"make the divider\r\nand wheel post longer,\" to \"put the crank one inch farther back,\" and so\r\nforth. Also, in the will of Robert McCormick, there is a clause\r\nauthorizing the executor to pay a royalty to Cyrus of fifteen dollars\r\napiece on whatever machines were sold by the family during that season,\r\nshowing that the father, who of all men was in the best position to\r\nknow, regarded Cyrus as the inventor.\r\n\r\nOf all the manufacturers who fought McCormick in the patent suits of\r\nearly days, three only have survived to see the passing of the McCormick\r\nCentenary--Ralph Emerson, C. W. Marsh, and William N. Whiteley. In\r\nresponse to a question as to Cyrus McCormick's place as an inventor,\r\nMr. Whiteley said: \"McCormick invented the divider and the practical\r\nreel; and he was the first man to make the Reaper a success in the\r\nfield.\" Mr. Marsh said: \"He was a meritorious inventor, although he\r\ncombined the ideas of other men with his own; and he produced the first\r\npractical side-delivery machine in the market.\" And Mr. Emerson said:\r\n\"The enemies of Cyrus H. McCormick have said that he was not an\r\ninventor, but I say that he was an inventor of eminence.\"\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the invention of the Reaper was not in any sense\r\nunique; it came about by an evolutionary process such as produced all\r\nother great discoveries and inventions. First come the dreamers, the\r\ntheorists, the heroic innovators who awaken the world's brain upon a new\r\nline of thought. Then come the pioneers who solve certain parts of the\r\nproblem and make suggestions that are of practical value. And then, in\r\nthe fulness of time, comes one masterful man who is more of a doer than\r\na dreamer, who works out the exact combination of ideas to produce the\r\nresult, and establishes the new product as a necessary part of the\r\nequipment of the whole human family.\r\n\r\nCyrus Hall McCormick invented the Reaper. He did more--he invented the\r\nbusiness of making Reapers and selling them to the farmers of America\r\nand foreign countries. He held preëminence in this line, with scarcely a\r\nbreak, until his death; and the manufacturing plant that he founded is\r\nto-day the largest of its kind. Thus, it is no more than an exact\r\nstatement of the truth to say that he did more than any other member of\r\nthe human race to abolish the famine of the cities and the drudgery of\r\nthe farm--to feed the hungry and straighten the bent backs of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSIXTEEN YEARS OF PIONEERING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Cyrus McCormick had his Reaper, but the great world knew nothing\r\nof it. None of the 850 papers that were being printed at this time in\r\nthe United States had given the notice of its birth. There was the young\r\ninventor, with the one machine that the human race most needed, in a\r\nremote cleft of the Virginian mountains, four days' journey from\r\nRichmond, and wholly without any experience or money or influence that\r\nwould enable him to announce what he had done.\r\n\r\nHe had such a problem to solve as no inventor of to-day or to-morrow can\r\nhave. He was not living, as we are, in an age of faith and\r\noptimism--when every new invention is welcomed with a shout of joy. He\r\nconfronted a sceptical and slow-moving little world, so different from\r\nthat of to-day that it requires a few lines of portrayal.\r\n\r\nIn general, it was a non-inventive and hand-labor world. There were few\r\nfactories, except for the weaving of cotton and woollen cloth. There\r\nwas no sewing-machine, nor Bessemer converter, nor Hoe press, nor\r\ntelegraph, nor photography. It was still the age of the tallow candle\r\nand stage-coach and tinder-box. Practically no such thing was known as\r\nfarm machinery. Jethro Wood had invented his iron plow, but he was at\r\nthis time dying in poverty, never having been able to persuade farmers\r\nto abandon their plows of wood. As for steel plows, no one in any\r\ncountry had conceived of such a thing. James Oliver was a bare-footed\r\nschool-boy in Scotland and John Deere was a young blacksmith in Vermont.\r\nPlows were pulled by oxen and horses, not by slaves, as in certain\r\nregions of Asia; but almost every other sort of farm work was done by\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nRailways were few and of little account. Eighty-two miles of flimsy\r\ntrack had been built in the United States; the Baltimore and Ohio was\r\nmaking a solemn experiment with locomotives, horses, and _sails_, to\r\nascertain which one of these three was the best method of propulsion.\r\nThe first really successful American locomotive was put on the rails in\r\nthis year; and Professor Joseph Henry set up his trial telegraph wire\r\nand gave the electric current its first lesson in obedience.\r\n\r\nThere was no free library in the world in 1831. The first one was\r\nstarted in Peterborough, N. H., two years later. In England, electoral\r\nreform had not begun, a General Fast had been ordered because of the\r\nprevalence of cholera, and a four-pound loaf cost more than the day's\r\npay of a laborer. The United States was a twenty-four-State republic,\r\nwith very little knowledge of two-thirds of its own territory. The\r\nsource of the Mississippi River, for instance, was unknown. To send a\r\nletter from Boston to New York cost the price of half a bushel of wheat.\r\nThere was no newspaper in Wisconsin and no house in Iowa. The first sale\r\nof lots was announced in Chicago, but there was then no public building\r\nin that hamlet, nothing but a few log cabins in a swampy waste that was\r\npopulous only in wild ducks, bears, and wolves. Forty of the latter were\r\nshot by the villagers in 1834.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAPING WITH CRUDE KNIVES IN INDIA]\r\n\r\nOf the many eminent men who had the same birth-year as McCormick, Poe\r\nand Mendelssohn had begun to be known as men of genius in 1831. But\r\nLincoln was then \"a sort of clerk\" in a village store. Darwin was\r\nsetting out on H. M. S. _Beagle_ upon his first voyage as a naturalist.\r\nGladstone was a student at Oxford. Proudhon was working at the case as a\r\npoor printer. Oliver Wendell Holmes was somewhat aimlessly studying law.\r\nChopin was on his way to Paris. Tennyson had left college, without a\r\ndegree, to devote his life to the service of poetry. Three great men who\r\nhad been born earlier, Garrison, Whittier, and Mazzini, began their\r\nlife-work in 1831. And science was a babe in the cradle. Herbert\r\nSpencer, Virchow and Pasteur were learning the multiplication table.\r\nHuxley was six and Bertheiot four.\r\n\r\nThere was no Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, California, nor\r\nTexas. Virginia was the main wheat State. Local famines were of\r\nyearly occurrence. The period between 1816 and 1820 had been\r\none of severe depression and was bitterly referred to as the\r\n\"1800-and-starve-to-death\" period. Seventy-five thousand people had\r\nbeen imprisoned for debt in New York in a single year, and a\r\nworkingmen's party had sprung up as a protest against such intolerable\r\nconditions. Even as late as 1837 there was a bread riot in the city of\r\nNew York. Five thousand hungry rioters broke into the warehouse of Eli\r\nHart & Company, and destroyed a great quantity of flour and wheat. Five\r\nhundred barrels of flour were thrown from the windows; and women and\r\nchildren gathered it up greedily from the dirty gutter where it fell.\r\n\r\nSo the world that confronted Cyrus McCormick was not a friendly world of\r\nscience and invention and prosperity. It was slow and dull and largely\r\nhostile to whoever would teach it a better way of working. And we shall\r\nnow see by what means McCormick compelled it to accept his Reaper, and\r\nto give him the credit and pay for his invention.\r\n\r\nHe was resolved from the first not to be robbed and flung aside as most\r\ninventors had been. Whitney, the inventor of the cotton-gin, had said in\r\n1812: \"The whole amount I have received is not equal to the value of the\r\nlabor saved in one hour by my machines now in use.\" Fulton had died at\r\nfifty, plagued and plundered by imitators. Kay, Jacquard, Heathcoat, and\r\nHargreaves, inventors of weaving machinery, were mobbed. Arkwright's\r\nmill was burned by incendiaries. Gutenberg, Cort, and Jethro Wood lost\r\ntheir fortunes. Palissy was thrown into the Bastile. And Goodyear, who\r\ngave us rubber, Bottgher, who gave us Sèvres porcelain, and Sauvage, who\r\ngave us the screw propeller, died in poverty and neglect.\r\n\r\nBut Cyrus McCormick was more than an inventor. He was a\r\nbusiness-builder. In the same resolute, deliberate way in which he had\r\nmade his Reaper, he now set to work to make a business. He planned and\r\nfigured and made experiments. \"His whole soul was wrapped up in his\r\nReaper,\" said one of the neighbors. Once while riding home on horseback\r\nin the Summer of 1832, his horse stopped to drink in the centre of a\r\nstream, and as he looked out upon the fields of yellow grain, shimmering\r\nin the sunlight, the dazzling thought flashed upon his brain, \"Perhaps I\r\nmay make a million dollars from this Reaper.\" As he said in a letter\r\nwritten in later years: \"This thought was so enormous that it seemed\r\nlike a dream-like dwelling in the clouds--so remote, so unattainable, so\r\nexalted, so visionary.\"\r\n\r\nHis first step was seemingly a mistake, though it must have contributed\r\nmuch toward the development of self-reliance and hardihood in his own\r\ncharacter. He received a tract of land from his father, and proceeded\r\nwith might and main to farm it alone. There was a small log house on his\r\nland, and here he lived with two aged negro servants and his Reaper.\r\n\r\nHe needed money to buy iron--to advertise--to appoint agents. And he had\r\nno means of earning money except by farming.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that he had not set aside his purpose to make\r\nReapers, for we find in the _Lexington Union_ of September 28, 1833, the\r\nfirst advertisement of his machine. He offers Reapers for sale at $50.00\r\napiece, and gives four testimonials from farmers. But nothing came of\r\nthis advertisement. No farmer came forward to buy. The four men who had\r\ngiven testimonials had only seen the Reaper at work. They were not\r\npurchasers. McCormick was \"a voice crying in the wilderness\" for _nine\r\nyears_ before he found a farmer who had the money and the courage to buy\r\none of his Reapers.\r\n\r\nAfter living for more than a year on his farm, McCormick saw that as a\r\nmeans of raising money it was a failure. It had given him a most\r\nvaluable period of preparatory solitude, but it had not helped him to\r\nlaunch the Reaper; so he looked about him for some enterprise that would\r\nyield a larger profit. There was a large deposit of iron ore near by,\r\nand he resolved to build a furnace and make iron. Iron was the most\r\nexpensive item in the making of a reaper. At that time it was $50.00 a\r\nton--two and a half cents a pound. So as he had been unable to establish\r\nthe Reaper business with a farm, he now set out to do it with a furnace.\r\nHe persuaded his father and the school teacher to become his partners;\r\nand they built the furnace and were making their first iron in\r\n1835--the same year, by the way, in which a babe named Andrew Carnegie\r\nwas born in the little Scotch town of Dunfermline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAPING WITH SICKLES IN ALGERIA]\r\n\r\nFor several years the furnace did fairly well. It swallowed the ore and\r\ncharcoal and limestone, and poured into the channelled sand little\r\nsputtering streams of fiery metal. Cyrus made the patterns for the\r\nmoulds, and, because of his great strength, did much of the heaviest\r\nlabor. But the work was so incessant that he had no time to build\r\nReapers. And in 1839, when the effects of the 1837 panic were felt in\r\nthe more remote regions of Virginia, Cyrus McCormick realized to the\r\nfull the aptness of that couplet of Hudibras--\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, me, the perils that environ\r\n    The man who meddles with cold iron!\"\r\n\r\nThe price of iron fell; debtors were unable to pay; the school teacher\r\nsigned over his property to his mother; and the whole burden of the\r\ninevitable bankruptcy fell upon the McCormicks. Cyrus gave up his farm\r\nto the creditors, and whatever other property he had that was saleable.\r\nHe did not give up the Reaper, and nobody would have taken it if he\r\nhad. Thus far, he had made no progress towards the building of a Reaper\r\nbusiness. Instead of being the owner of a million, or any part of a\r\nmillion, he was eight years older than when he had begun to seek his\r\nfortune, and penniless.\r\n\r\nIn this hour of debt and defeat Cyrus became the leader of the family.\r\nHere for the first time he showed that indomitable spirit which was,\r\nmore than any other one thing, the secret of his success. At once he did\r\nwhat he had not felt was possible before--he began to make Reapers.\r\nWithout money, without credit, without customers, he founded the first\r\nof the world's reaper factories in the little log workshop near his\r\nfather's house. In the year of the iron failure, 1839, he gave a public\r\nexhibition on the farm of Joshua Smith, near the town of Staunton. With\r\ntwo men and a team of horses he cut two acres of wheat an hour. At this\r\nthere was great applause, but no buyers.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of that day were not accustomed to the use of machinery.\r\nTheir farm tools, for the most part, were so simple as to be made\r\neither by themselves or by the village blacksmith. That the Reaper did\r\nthe work of ten men, they could not deny. But it was driven by an\r\nexpert. \"It's all very wonderful, but I'm running a farm, not a circus,\"\r\nthought the average spectator at these exhibitions. Also, there was in\r\nall Eastern States at that time a surplus of labor and a scarcity of\r\nmoney, both of which tended to retard the adoption of the Reaper.\r\n\r\nNeither did the business men of Staunton pay any serious attention to\r\nit. There was a Samson Eager at that time who made wagons, a David\r\nGilkerson who made furniture, a Jacob Kurtz who made spinning wheels,\r\nand an Absalom Brooks who made harness. But none of these men saw any\r\nfortune in the making of Reapers, and Staunton lost its great\r\nopportunity to be a manufacturing centre.\r\n\r\nFailure was being heaped on failure, yet Cyrus McCormick hung to his\r\nReaper as John Knox had to his Bible. He went back to the little log\r\nworkshop with a fighting hope in his heart, and hammered away to make a\r\nstill better machine.\r\n\r\nThis was the darkest period in the history of the McCormicks--from 1837\r\nto 1840. Once a constable named John Newton rode up to the farm-house\r\ndoor with a summons, calling Cyrus and his father before the County\r\nJudge on account of a debt of $19.01. A teamster named John Brains had\r\nbrought suit. His bill had been $72.00 and he had been paid more than\r\nthree-fourths of the money. But the constable was so impressed with the\r\nhonesty and industry of the McCormicks, that he rode back to town\r\nwithout having served the summons. A little later, Mr. John Brains\r\nreceived his money; and it may be said that had he accepted, instead, a\r\nfive per cent interest in the Reaper, he would have become in twenty\r\nyears or less one of the richest men in the county.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, not one of Cyrus McCormick's creditors thought of such\r\nan idea as seizing the Reaper, or the patent, which had been secured in\r\n1834. If the queer-looking machine, which was regarded as part marvel\r\nand part freak, had been put up to auction in that neighborhood of\r\nfarmers, very likely it would have found no bidders. There appeared to\r\nbe one man only, a William Massie, who appreciated the ability of Cyrus\r\nMcCormick and lent him sums of money on various urgent occasions.\r\n\r\nBut in 1840 a stranger rode from the north and drew rein in front of the\r\nlittle log workshop. In appearance he was a rough-looking man, but to\r\nCyrus he was an angel of light. He had come to buy a Reaper. He had been\r\none of the spectators at the Staunton exhibition, and he had resolved to\r\nrisk $50 on one of the new machines. His name, which deserves to be\r\nrecorded in the annals of the Reaper, was Abraham Smith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAPING WITH CRADLES IN ILLINOIS]\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks later came two other angels in disguise--farmers who had\r\nheard of the Reaper and who had ridden from their homes on the James\r\nRiver, a forty-mile journey on horseback through the Blue Ridge\r\nMountains. These men had never seen a Reaper, but they had faith.\r\nThey were notable men. Both ordered machines, and Cyrus McCormick\r\naccepted one of the orders only, as he was not satisfied with the way\r\nhis Reaper worked in grain that was wet. It was apt to clog in the\r\ngrooves that held the blade. Even in this darkest and most debt-ridden\r\nperiod of his life, McCormick was much more intent, apparently, upon\r\nmaking his Reapers work well than upon winning a fortune.\r\n\r\nAlmost breathlessly, the young inventor waited for the next harvest.\r\nThis was the unique difficulty of his task, that he had only a few weeks\r\nonce a year to try out his machine and to improve it. He had now sold\r\ntwo, so that there were three Reapers clicking through the grain-fields\r\nin the Summer of 1840. They failed to operate evenly. Where the grain\r\nwas dry, they cut well; but where it was damp, they clogged and at times\r\nrefused to cut at all.\r\n\r\nWet grain! This, after nine years of arduous labor, still remained a\r\nstubborn obstacle to the success of the Reaper. It was especially hard\r\nto overcome, because in that primitive neighborhood McCormick could not\r\nsecure the best workmanship in the making of the cutting-blade. However,\r\nthis obstacle did not daunt him. He gave his blade a more serrated edge,\r\nand to his delight it cut down the wet grain very nearly as neatly as\r\nthe dry.\r\n\r\nThis success had cost him another year, for he sold no machines in 1841.\r\nBut he had now, at least, a wholly satisfactory Reaper. Fortified with a\r\ntestimonial from Abraham Smith, he fixed the price at $100 and became a\r\nsalesman. By great persistence he sold seven Reapers in 1842,\r\ntwenty-nine in 1843, and fifty in 1844. At last, after thirteen years of\r\nstruggle and defeat, Cyrus McCormick had succeeded; and the home farm\r\nwas transformed into a busy and triumphant Reaper factory.\r\n\r\nThere were new obstacles, of course. A few buyers failed to pay. Four\r\nmachines were held on loitering canal-boats until they were too late for\r\nthe harvest. There was strong opposition in several places by day\r\nlaborers. A trusted workman who was sent out to collect $300 ran away\r\nwith both horse and money. But none of these trifles moved the\r\nvictorious McCormick. The great stubborn world was about to surrender,\r\nand he knew it.\r\n\r\nBy 1844 he had done more than sell machines. He had made converts. One\r\nenthusiastic farmer named James M. Hite, who had made a world's record\r\nin 1843 by cutting 175 acres of wheat in less than eight days, was the\r\nfirst of these apostles of the Reaper. \"My Reaper has more than paid for\r\nitself in one harvest,\" he said; and he gave $1,333 for the right to\r\nsell Reapers in eight counties. Closely after this man came Colonel\r\nTutwiler, who agreed to pay $2,500 for the right to sell in southern\r\nVirginia. And a manufacturer in Richmond, J. Parker, bought an agency in\r\nfive counties for $500; and won the renown of being the first business\r\nman who appreciated the Reaper. All this money was not paid in at once.\r\nSome of it was never paid. But after thirteen years of struggle and\r\ndebt, this was Big Business.\r\n\r\nBest of all, orders for seven Reapers had come from the West. Two\r\nfarmers in Tennessee and one each in Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa,\r\nIllinois, and Ohio, had written to McCormick for \"Virginia Reapers,\" as\r\nthey were called in the farm papers of that day. These seven letters, as\r\nmay be imagined, brought great joy and satisfaction to the McCormick\r\nfamily, which was now, under the leadership of Cyrus, devoting its best\r\nenergies to the making of Reapers. The Reapers were made and then, when\r\nthe question of their transportation arose, Cyrus for the first time saw\r\nclearly that the Virginia farm was not the best site for a factory. To\r\nget the seven Reapers to the West, they had first to be carried in\r\nwagons to Scottsville, then by canal to Richmond, re-shipped down the\r\nJames River to the Atlantic Ocean and around Florida to New Orleans,\r\ntransferred here to a river boat that went up the Mississippi and Ohio\r\nRivers to Cincinnati, and from Cincinnati in various directions to the\r\nexpectant farmers. Four of these Reapers arrived too late for the\r\nharvest of 1844, and two of them were not paid for. Clearly, something\r\nmust be done to supply the Western farmers more efficiently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARLY ADVERTISEMENT FOR McCORMICK'S PATENT VIRGINIA\r\nREAPER]\r\n\r\nAt this time a friend said to him, \"Cyrus, why don't you go West with\r\nyour Reaper, where the land is level and labor is scarce?\" His mind was\r\nripe for this idea. It was the call of the West. So one morning he put\r\n$300 into his belt and set off on a 3,000-mile journey to establish the\r\nempire of the Reaper. Up through Pennsylvania he rode by stage to Lake\r\nOntario, then westward through Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin,\r\nIowa, and Missouri.\r\n\r\nFor the first time he saw the _prairies_. So vast, so flat, so fertile,\r\nthese boundless plains amazed him. And he was quick to see that this\r\ngreat land ocean was the natural home of the Reaper. Virginia might, but\r\nthe West _must_, accept his new machine.\r\n\r\nAlready the West was in desperate need of a quicker way to cut grain. As\r\nMcCormick rode through Illinois, he saw the most convincing argument in\r\nfavor of his Reaper. He saw hogs and cattle turned into fields of ripe\r\nwheat, for lack of laborers to gather it in. The fertile soil had given\r\nIllinois five million bushels of wheat, and it was too much. It was more\r\nthan the sickle and the scythe could cut. Men toiled and sweltered to\r\nsave the yellow affluence from destruction. They worked by day and by\r\nnight; and their wives and children worked. But the tragic aspect of the\r\ngrain crop is this--it must be gathered quickly or it breaks down and\r\ndecays. It will not wait. The harvest season lasts from four to ten days\r\nonly. And whoever cannot snatch his grain from the field during this\r\nshort period must lose it.\r\n\r\nTruly, the West needed the Reaper; and McCormick's first plan was to\r\novercome the transportation obstacle by selling licenses to many\r\nmanufacturers in many States. By 1846 he had, with herculean energy,\r\nstarted Fitch & Company and Seymour, Morgan & Company in Brockport, N.\r\nY., Henry Bear in Missouri, Gray & Warner in Illinois, and A. C. Brown\r\nin Cincinnati. These manufacturers, and the McCormick family in\r\nVirginia, built 190 Reapers for the harvest of 1846. This was\r\nmultiplying the business by four, very nearly, but the plan was not\r\nsatisfactory. Some manufacturers used poor materials; some had unskilled\r\nworkmen; and one became so absorbed in new experiments that when the\r\nharvest time arrived, his machines were not completed.\r\n\r\nThe new difficulty was not to get manufacturers to make Reapers, but to\r\nget them to make _good_ Reapers. What was to be done? The thought of\r\nhaving defective Reapers scattered among the farmers was intolerable to\r\nCyrus McCormick. He pondered deeply over the whole situation. He\r\nconsidered the fact that the supremacy in wheat was slowly passing from\r\nVirginia to Ohio. He took note of the railroads that were creeping\r\nwestward. He remembered the limitless prairies, far out in the sunset\r\ncountry, that were still uncultivated. Plainly, he must make Reapers in\r\na factory of his own, so as to have them made well, and he must locate\r\nthat factory as near as possible to the prairies, at some point along\r\nthe Great Lakes. With the most painstaking diligence he studied the map\r\nand finally he put his finger upon a town--a small new town, which bore\r\nthe strange name of _Chicago_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING OF THE REAPER BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the cities that Cyrus McCormick had seen in his 3,000-mile\r\njourney, Chicago was unquestionably the youngest, the ugliest, and the\r\nmost forlorn. It lacked the comforts of ordinary life, and many of the\r\nnecessities. For the most part, it was the residuum of a broken land\r\nboom; and most of its citizens were remaining in the hope that they\r\nmight persuade some incoming stranger to buy them out.\r\n\r\nThe little community, which had absurdly been called a city ten years\r\nbefore, had at this time barely ten thousand people--as many as are now\r\nemployed by a couple of its department stores. It was exhausted by a\r\ndesperate struggle with mud, dust, floods, droughts, cholera, debt,\r\npanics, broken banks, and a slump in land values. Other cities ridiculed\r\nits ambitions and called it a mudhole. Its harbor, into which six small\r\nschooners ventured in 1847, was obstructed by a sand-bar. And the entire\r\nregion, for miles back from the lake, was a dismal swamp--the natural\r\nhome of frogs, wild ducks, and beavers.\r\n\r\nThe six years between 1837 and 1843 had been to Illinois a period of the\r\ndeepest discouragement. There was little or no money that any one could\r\naccept with confidence. Trade was on a barter basis. The State was\r\nhopelessly in debt. It had borrowed $14,000,000 in the enthusiasm of its\r\nfirst land boom, and now had no money to pay the interest. Even as late\r\nas 1846 there was only $9,000 in the State treasury.\r\n\r\nBuffalo was at this time the chief grain market of the United States. We\r\nwere selling a little wheat to foreign countries--much less than is\r\ngrown to-day in Oklahoma. Hulled corn was the staff of life in Iowa. The\r\nMormons had just started from Illinois on their 1,500-mile pilgrimage to\r\nthe West, through a country that had not a road, a village, a bridge,\r\nnor a well. The sewing-machine had recently been invented by Howe, and\r\nthe use of ether had been announced by Dr. Morton; but there was no Hoe\r\npress, nor Bessemer steel, nor even so much as a postage stamp. And in\r\nthe Old World the two most impressive figures, perhaps, were\r\nLivingstone, the missionary, who was groping his way to the heart of the\r\nDark Continent, and DeLesseps, the master-builder of canals, who was now\r\ncutting a channel through the hot sand at Suez.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, there was at this time no Board of Trade. The first wheat\r\nhad been exported nine years before--as much as would load an ordinary\r\nwagon. There was no paved street, except one short block of wooden\r\npaving. The houses were rickety, unpainted frame shanties, which had not\r\neven the dignity of being numbered. There was a school, a jail, a police\r\nforce of six, a theatre, and a fire-engine. But there was no railroad,\r\nnor telegraph, nor gas, nor sewer, nor stock-yards. The only post-office\r\nwas a little frame shack on Clark Street, with one window and one clerk;\r\nand one of the lesser hardships of the citizens was to stand in line\r\nhere on rainy days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE McCORMICK REAPER OF 1847, ON WHICH SEATS WERE PLACED\r\nFOR THE DRIVER AND THE RAKER]\r\n\r\nProsperity was still an elusive hope in 1847, but the spirit of\r\ndepression was being overcome. The Federal bankrupt law of 1842 had\r\nbroken the deadlock, and the Legislature had passed several \"Hard Times\"\r\nmeasures for the relief of debtors. To such an extent had the little\r\ncommunity recovered its confidence that it opened a new theatre,\r\nwelcomed its first circus, founded a law-school, launched a new daily\r\npaper called the _Tribune_, and organized a regiment for the Mexican\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThere were two Chicago events in this year which must have deeply\r\nimpressed Cyrus McCormick. The first was the arrival of a horde of\r\nhunger-driven immigrants from Ireland. The famine of 1846, which had\r\ncaused 210,000 deaths in that unfortunate island, was driving the\r\nsurvivors to America; and the people of Chicago showed the warmest\r\nsympathy towards these gaunt, sad-faced newcomers. Even in the depth of\r\nher own depression, Chicago called a special meeting to consider what\r\ncould be done to alleviate the suffering of the Irish, and gave several\r\nthousand dollars for their relief.\r\n\r\nThe second event was the holding of the great \"River and Harbor\r\nConvention\" in Chicago. This was the first formal recognition of\r\nChicago by Congress, and gave the greatest possible amount of delight\r\nand reassurance to its citizens. Abraham Lincoln, who had just been\r\nelected to Congress, was there; and Horace Greeley and Thurlow Weed.\r\nThere was a grand procession in the muddy little main street. A ship\r\nunder full sail was hauled through the city on wheels. The newly\r\norganized firemen, in the glory of red shirts and leather hats, threw a\r\nstream of water over the flag-staff in the public square, and Thurlow\r\nWeed, in a peroration that aroused the utmost enthusiasm, prophesied\r\nthat \"on the shores of these lakes is a vast country that will in fifty\r\nyears support one-quarter of a million people.\" It is interesting to\r\nnotice that had Thurlow Weed lived fifty years after the delivery of\r\nthat optimistic prophecy, he would have seen one-quarter of a million\r\nschool children in the city of Chicago alone.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of history, the arrival of McCormick was a much more\r\nimportant event for Chicago than the \"River and Harbor Convention.\" He\r\nwas the first of its big manufacturers. His factory was the largest and\r\nthe busiest; and the Reapers that it produced were a most important\r\nfactor in the growth of Chicago. Every Reaper shipped to the West was a\r\nfeeder of the city. It brought back more wheat. It opened up new\r\nterritory. The Reaper gave the farmers of the Middle West an ideal\r\nweapon with which to win wealth from the prairies. And it established\r\nthe primary greatness of Chicago as the principal wheat market of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThis incoming flood of wheat gave Chicago its start as a railway and\r\nshipping centre. Chicago was never obliged to give money, or to lend it,\r\nto railroad companies. The railroads came into Chicago without the\r\ninducement of subsidies, because they wanted to carry its wheat. And\r\nships, too, came more and more readily to Chicago when they found that\r\nthey could be sure of a return cargo.\r\n\r\nThe choice of Chicago as his centre of operations was one of the\r\nmaster-strokes of McCormick's career. At that time, Cleveland,\r\nMilwaukee, and St. Louis were more prosperous cities; but McCormick\r\nconsidered one thing only--the making and selling of his Reaper, and he\r\nsaw that Chicago, with all its mud and shabbiness, was the link between\r\nthe Great Lakes and the Great West. Here he could best assemble his\r\nmaterials--steel from Sheffield, pig iron from Scotland and Pittsburg,\r\nand white ash from Michigan. And here he could best ship his finished\r\nmachines to both East and West.\r\n\r\nChicago, in fact, and the McCormick Reaper, had many characteristics in\r\ncommon. Both were born at very nearly the same time. Both were cradled\r\nin adversity. Both were unsightly to the artistic eye. Both were linked\r\nclosely with the development of the West. And both inevitably achieved\r\nsuccess, because they were fundamentally right--Chicago in location and\r\nthe Reaper in design.\r\n\r\nAt the time that he began to build his Chicago factory, Cyrus McCormick\r\nwas no longer a country youth. He was thirty-eight years of age, and a\r\ntall powerful Titan of a man, with a massive head and broad shoulders.\r\nHis upper lip was clean-shaven, but he had a thick, well-trimmed beard,\r\nand dark, wavy hair, worn fairly long. His nose was straight and\r\nwell-shaped, his mouth firm, and his eyes brown-gray and piercing. In\r\nmanner he was resolute and prompt, with a rigid insistence that could\r\nnot be turned aside. He had won the prize in the contest of\r\nreaper-inventors; and he was now about to enter a second contest,\r\nagainst overwhelming odds, with a number of aggressive and competent\r\nbusiness men who had determined that, by right or by might, they would\r\nmanufacture McCormick Reapers and sell them to the farmers.\r\n\r\nAs McCormick had neither money nor credit, it was evident to him that\r\nhis first step in business-building must be to secure a partner who had\r\nboth of these. He looked about him and selected the man who was\r\nunquestionably the first citizen of Chicago--William B. Ogden. Ogden had\r\nbeen the first mayor of the little city. He had been from the beginning\r\nits natural leader. He had built the first handsome house, promoted the\r\nfirst canal, and was now busy in the building of the first railroad\r\nfrom Chicago to Galena.\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Ogden had been born in the little New York hamlet of\r\nWalton, four years earlier than the birth of McCormick. To use his own\r\npicturesque words, he \"was born close to a saw-mill, was early left an\r\norphan, christened in a mill-pond, taught at a log school-house, and at\r\nfourteen fancied that nothing was impossible, which ever since, and with\r\nsome success, I have been trying to prove.\" Once in Chicago he quickly\r\nmade a fortune in real estate, and was generally looked to as the leader\r\nin any large enterprise that promised to help Chicago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRUS HALL McCORMICK\r\n\r\nFrom a Daguerreotype, taken about 1839]\r\n\r\nHe was a tall man of striking appearance. At that time he wore no beard,\r\nand with his keen eyes, high forehead, long straight nose, and masterful\r\nunder-lip, he would attract attention in any assemblage. By his\r\nhospitality and courtly manners he made many friends for the city. Among\r\nhis guests were Webster, Van Buren, Bryant, Tilden, and Miss Martineau.\r\nAnd when Cyrus McCormick came to him and proposed the building of a\r\nReaper factory, Ogden was as quick as a flash to see its value to\r\nChicago. \"You are the man we want,\" said he to McCormick. \"I'll give you\r\n$25,000 for a half interest, and we'll start to build the factory at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nThis partnership helped McCormick greatly. It gave him at once capital,\r\ncredit, prestige, and a factory. It enabled him to escape from the\r\ntyranny of small anxieties. It set him free from contract-breaking\r\nmanufacturers, who looked upon the making of Reapers merely as business,\r\nand not, as McCormick did, as a mission. He now had his chance to\r\nmanufacture on a large scale; and he immediately made plans to sell 500\r\nReapers for the harvest of 1848. He built the largest factory in\r\nChicago, on the spot where John Kinzie had built the first house in\r\n1804, and thus once for all was solved the problem of where and how his\r\nReapers should be made.\r\n\r\nFor two years it was one of the sights of Chicago to see McCormick and\r\nOgden walking together to their factory. They were both tall, powerful,\r\ndominating men, and were easily the chief citizens--the Romulus and\r\nRemus of a city that was destined to be more populous than Rome.\r\n\r\nBut they were not suited as co-workers. Each was too strong-willed for\r\nco-operative action. Also, Ogden was a man of many interests, while\r\nMcCormick was absorbed in his Reaper. There was no open quarrel, but in\r\n1849 McCormick said: \"I will pay you back the $25,000 that you invested,\r\nand give you $25,000 for profits and interest.\" Ogden accepted, well\r\npleased to have doubled his money in two years; and from that time\r\nonward McCormick had no partners except the members of his own family.\r\n\r\nMoving at once from one obstacle to another, as McCormick did throughout\r\nthe whole course of his life, he now began to create the best possible\r\n_system_ of selling his Reapers to the farmers. This he had to do, for\r\nthe reason that there was no means at that time whereby he could offer\r\nthem for sale. The village blacksmith was too busy at his anvil to\r\nbecome an agent. The village storekeeper was not a mechanic, and was\r\ntoo careful of his reputation among the farmers to offer for sale a\r\nmachine that he did not understand. Therefore, McCormick bent all his\r\nenergies to this new task of devising a mode of action. He began to\r\ndevelop what he was apt to call \"the finger-ends of the business.\" And\r\nhe created a new species of commercial organization which is by many\r\nthought to be fully as remarkable as his invention of the Reaper.\r\n\r\nFirst, he gave a _Written Guarantee_ with every machine. He had\r\nconceived of this inducement as early as 1842. He \"warranted the\r\nperformance of the Reaper in every respect,\" and by this means made\r\nseven sales in that year. In 1848 he had his guarantee printed like an\r\nadvertisement, with a picture of the Reaper at the top, and blank spaces\r\nfor the farmer, the agent, and two witnesses to sign. The price of the\r\nmachine was to be $120. The farmer was to pay $30 cash, and the balance\r\nin six months, on condition that the Reaper would cut one and a half\r\nacres an hour, that it would scatter less grain than the grain-cradle,\r\nthat it was well made, and that the raking off could easily be done from\r\na raker's seat. If the Reaper failed to fulfil these promises, it was to\r\nbe brought back and the $30 was to be refunded.\r\n\r\nThis idea of giving a free trial, and returning the money to any\r\ndissatisfied customer, was at that time new and revolutionary. To-day it\r\nis the code of the department store, and even the mail-order\r\nestablishments are in many instances adopting it. It has become one of\r\nthe higher laws of the business world. It has driven that discreditable\r\nmaxim, \"Let the buyer beware,\" out of all decent commercialism. To\r\nMcCormick, who had never studied the selfish economic theories of his\r\nday, there was no reason for any antagonism between buyer and seller. He\r\ntrusted his Reaper and he trusted the farmers. And he built his business\r\nfoursquare on this confidence.\r\n\r\nSecond, he sold his Reapers at a _Known Price_. He announced the price\r\nin newspapers and posters. This, too, has since become an established\r\nrule in business; but it was not so sixty years ago. The Oriental method\r\nof chaffering and bargaining was largely in vogue. The buyer got as high\r\na price as he could in each case. Among merchants, A. T. Stewart was\r\nprobably the first to abolish this practice of haggling, and to mark his\r\ngoods in plain figures. And in the selling of farm machinery, it was\r\nMcCormick who laid down the principle of equal prices to all and special\r\nrebates to none--a principle which has been very generally followed ever\r\nsince, except during periods of over-strenuous competition.\r\n\r\nThird, he was one of the first American business men who believed\r\nheartily in a policy of _Publicity_. As early as September 28, 1833, he\r\nbegan to advertise his Reaper; and his advertisement was nearly a column\r\nin length. Also, in the same paper, he had a half-column advertisement\r\nof his hillside plow. This was publicity on a large scale, according to\r\nthe ideas of advertising that were then prevalent. Even George\r\nWashington, when advertising an extensive land scheme in 1773, had not\r\nthought of using more than half a column of a Baltimore paper.\r\n\r\nMcCormick was an efficient advertiser, too, as well as an enterprising\r\none. When he talked to farmers, he knew what to say. He told the story\r\nof what one of his Reapers had done, and named the time and the farm and\r\nthe farmers. He made great use of the argument that the Reaper pays for\r\nitself, and showed that it would cost the farmer less to buy it than\r\n_not_ to buy it.\r\n\r\nAmong the many testimonials that he got from farmers the one that\r\npleased him most, and which he scattered broadcast, was one in which a\r\nfarmer said: \"My Reaper has more than paid for itself in one harvest.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PANORAMIC VIEW SHOWING THE McCORMICK REAPER WORKS BEFORE\r\nTHE CHICAGO FIRE OF 1871, ON CHICAGO RIVER, EAST OF RUSH STREET BRIDGE]\r\n\r\nIn 1849, when the rush to the new gold mines of California began, he was\r\nquick to see his opportunity. This sudden exodus of a hundred thousand\r\nmen to the Pacific coast meant much to him, and he knew it. It meant a\r\ndecrease in the number of farm laborers and an increase in the amount of\r\nmoney in circulation. More than this, it meant that Chicago was no\r\nlonger a city of the Far West. It was _central_. It was the link between\r\nthe banks and factories of the East and the gold mines and prairies of\r\nthe West. So McCormick quickly prepared an elaborate advertisement,\r\nwarning the farmers that labor would now become scarce and expensive,\r\nthat the coming grain crop promised to be a large one, and giving the\r\nnames and addresses of ninety-two farmers who were now using his\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nThe fourth factor in the McCormick System was the appointment of a\r\n_Responsible Agent_ and the building of a storage warehouse at every\r\ncompetitive point. He did not wait for the business to grow. He pushed\r\nit. He thrust it forward by sending an agent to every danger-spot on the\r\nfiring-line. As one of his competitors complained, in an 1848 lawsuit,\r\nMcCormick \"flooded the country with his machines.\" He knew that many\r\nfarmers would be undecided until the very hour of harvest, when there\r\nwould be no time to get a Reaper from Chicago; and therefore he had\r\nsupplies of machines stored in various parts of the country. By 1849 he\r\nhad nineteen of these agencies.\r\n\r\nHis plan, with regard to these agents, was to fasten them to him by\r\nexclusive contracts, which forbade them to sell Reapers made by any\r\nother manufacturers. Each agent was given free scope. He was not worried\r\nby detail instructions. He was picked out for his aggressive,\r\nself-reliant qualities, and the whole responsibility of a certain\r\nterritory was put upon him. Once a month he made a report; but he stood\r\nor fell by the final showing for the year, which he made in October.\r\nThis plan of leaving his men free and putting them upon their mettle,\r\ndeveloped their mental muscle to the utmost. Also, it made them\r\nintensely loyal and combative--a regiment, not of private soldiers, but\r\ngenerals, each one in charge of his own province, blamed for his defeats\r\nand rewarded for his victories.\r\n\r\nThe fifth factor in the McCormick System was the _Customers' Good-Will_.\r\nFor the good-will of other capitalists or for the applause of the\r\npublic in general, no men cared less than McCormick. But he always stood\r\nwell with the farmers. \"I have never yet sued a farmer for the price of\r\na Reaper,\" he said in 1848. This heroic policy he pursued as long as\r\npossible, knowing the fear that all farmers have of contracts that may\r\nlead them into litigation. More than this, he freely gave them credit,\r\nwithout being safeguarded by any Dun or Bradstreet. He allowed them to\r\npay with the money that was saved during the harvest. \"It is better that\r\nI should wait for the money,\" he said, \"than that you should wait for\r\nthe machine that you need.\" So he borrowed money in Chicago to build the\r\nReapers, borrowed more money to pay the freight, and then sold them on\r\ntime to the farmers.\r\n\r\nIn some cases he lost heavily, as in Kansas and North Dakota, where the\r\nfirst settlers were driven off by drought. But as a rule he lost little\r\nby bad debts. Immigrants of twenty nationalities swarmed westward upon\r\nthe free land offered to them by the United States Government, and\r\nusually each man found waiting for him at the nearest town one of the\r\nMcCormick agents, ready to supply him with a Reaper, whether he had the\r\nmoney to pay for it or not. As may be imagined, the effect of this\r\npolicy upon the settlement and welfare of the West was magical. There\r\nare to-day tens of thousands of Western farmers who date the era of\r\ntheir prosperity from the day when a McCormick Reaper arrived in all the\r\nglory of its red paint and shining blade, and held its first reception\r\nin the barn-yard.\r\n\r\nOne instance of this deserves to be embodied in the history of the\r\nReaper. In 1855 a poor tenant farmer, who had been evicted from his\r\nrented land in Ayrshire, Scotland, arrived with his family at the banks\r\nof the Mississippi. There was then no railroad nor stage-coach, so the\r\nwhole family walked to a quarter section of land farther west, not far\r\nfrom where the city of Des Moines stands to-day. The first year they cut\r\nthe wheat with the cradle and the scythe, and the following year they\r\nbought a McCormick Reaper. They prospered. The father went back for a\r\nvisit to Ayrshire and paid all his creditors. And the eldest son,\r\nJames, became first Speaker of the Iowa Legislature, then a professor\r\nin an agricultural college, and finally the founder of the Department of\r\nAgriculture in all its present completeness. To-day we know him as the\r\nHonorable James Wilson, the first official farmer of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere was one other method in the marketing of farm machinery, which\r\nseems to have been originated by McCormick--the _Field Test_. As a means\r\nof stirring up interest in an indifferent community, this was the most\r\nelectrical in its effects of any plan that has ever been devised. As a\r\npioneering advertisement, it was unsurpassed. It was nothing less than a\r\ncontest in a field of ripe grain between several machines that belonged\r\nto rival manufacturers. Sometimes there were only two machines, and in\r\none grand tournament there were forty. And all the farmers in the county\r\nwere invited to come and witness the battle free of charge.\r\n\r\nThe first of these field tests occurred near Richmond in 1844. McCormick\r\nhad challenged Obed Hussey, a Baltimore sailor who had invented a\r\npractical mowing-machine, and who was offering it for sale to cut grain\r\nas well as grass. In this instance McCormick won easily. The judges said\r\nthat while the Hussey machine was stronger and simpler, having no reel\r\nnor divider, the McCormick Reaper was lighter, cheaper, scattered less\r\ngrain, and was better at cutting grain that was wet and in its method of\r\ndelivering the grain.\r\n\r\n\"Meet Hussey whenever you can and put him down,\" Cyrus McCormick wrote\r\nto his brothers. In one letter, written the following year, he is so\r\nenthusiastically aggressive in the pursuit of Hussey that he proposes to\r\nhis brothers a grand final contest. Hussey is to be dared to sign an\r\nagreement that in case of defeat, he will pay McCormick $10,000 and\r\nbecome the Maryland agent for the McCormick Reaper. McCormick, on his\r\npart, is to agree that if he is beaten he will pay Hussey $10,000 and\r\nbecome the Virginia agent for the Hussey machine. Nothing came of this\r\nconfident proposal, either because it was not put into effect by\r\nMcCormick, because Hussey refused to accept it.\r\n\r\nBut the field test flourished for more than forty years. It did more in\r\nthe earlier days than any other one thing to make talk about the Reaper\r\nand to move the farmers out of the old-fashioned ruts. It provided the\r\nvaudeville element which is necessary in salesmanship where people are\r\nnot interested in the commodity itself. As often happens, it was in the\r\nend carried too far. It became the most costly weapon of competition. It\r\nintroduced all manner of unfairness and often violence. The most absurd\r\ntests were frequently agreed to. Mowers would be chained back to back\r\nand then forcibly torn apart. Reapers were driven into groves of\r\nsaplings. Machines of special strength were made secretly. And so the\r\nwarfare raged, until by general consent the field test was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThese six factors of the McCormick System became the six commandments of\r\nthe farm machinery business. They were largely adopted by his\r\ncompetitors, and exist to-day, with the exception of the exclusive\r\ncontract and the field test.\r\n\r\nBy 1850 McCormick had not only solved the problem of the Reaper; he had\r\nworked out a method of distribution. He had established a new business.\r\nBut even this was not enough. He was now beset by a swarm of\r\nmanufacturers who sought to deprive him of his patents and of a business\r\nwhich he naturally regarded as his own. It remained to be seen whether\r\nhe could stand his ground when opposed by several hundred rivals; and\r\nwhether he could duplicate in the courts the victories that he had won\r\nin the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE TO PROTECT PATENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Cyrus McCormick's original patent expired. He applied to have it\r\nextended, and at once there began one of the most extraordinary legal\r\nwars ever known in the history of the Patent Office. It continued with\r\nvery little cessation until 1865. It enlisted on one side or the other\r\nthe ablest lawyers of that period--such giants of the bar as Lincoln,\r\nStanton, Seward, Douglas, Harding, Watson, Dickerson, and Reverdy\r\nJohnson. The tide of battle rolled from court to court until the final\r\nclash came in the chamber of the Supreme Court and the halls of\r\nCongress. It was perhaps the most Titanic effort that any American\r\ninventor has ever made to protect his rights and to carry out the\r\npurpose of the Patent Law.\r\n\r\nMcCormick had strong reasons for believing that his patent should be\r\nextended. He was asking for no more than the Patent Office, on other\r\noccasions, had granted to other inventors. A patent was supposed to\r\nprotect an inventor for fourteen years, and he had lost half of this\r\ntime in making a better machine, and in finding out the best way to\r\ncarry on the business. He had received from all sources nearly $24,000,\r\nand most of it had been swallowed up in expenses. He was still a poor\r\nman in 1848. He was no more than on the threshold of prosperity. And his\r\npeculiar difficulty, which gave him a special claim upon the Patent\r\nCommissioners, was the shortness of the harvest season. He had only\r\nthree or four weeks in each year in which he could make experiments.\r\n\r\nFor eight years McCormick's claim was tossed back and forth like a\r\ntennis ball between the Patent Office and Congress. This delay threw the\r\ndoor wide open to competition. A score of manufacturers built factories\r\nand began to make McCormick Reapers, with trifling variations and under\r\nother names. If McCormick had won his case, they would have had to pay\r\nhim a royalty of $25 on each machine. Consequently, they combined\r\nagainst him. They hired lawyers and lobbyists, secured petitions from\r\nfarmers, and raised a hue and cry that one man was \"trying to impose a\r\ntax of $500,000 a year upon the starving millions of the world.\"\r\n\r\nOne firm of lawyers in Cincinnati sent a letter to these manufacturers\r\nin 1850, saying that, \"McCormick can be beaten in the Patent Office, and\r\nmust be beaten now or never. If funds are furnished us, we shall surely\r\nbeat him; but if they are not furnished us, he will as certainly beat\r\nus. Please, therefore, take hold and help us to beat the _common enemy_.\r\nThe subscriptions have ranged from $100 to $1,000.... Send in also to\r\nPatent Office hundreds of remonstrances like this: We oppose the\r\nextension of C. H. McCormick's patent. He has made money enough off of\r\nthe farmer.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of this famous case, the anti-McCormick lobby at the\r\nCapitol became so rabid that Senator Brown, of Mississippi, made an\r\nindignant protest on the floor of the Senate. He said: \"Why, Mr.\r\nPresident, if it were not for the people out of doors, people without\r\ninventive genius, people without the genius to invent a mouse-trap or a\r\nfly-killer, who are pirating on the great invention of McCormick, there\r\nwould never have been an hour's delay in granting all that he asks. I\r\nknow, and I state here, in the face of the American Senate and the\r\nworld, that these men have beset me at every corner of the street with\r\ntheir papers and their affidavits--men who have no claim to the ear of\r\nthe country, men who have rendered it no service, but who have invested\r\ntheir paltry dollars in the production of a machine which sprang from\r\nthe mind of another man; and who now, for their own gain, employ lawyers\r\nto draw cunning affidavits, to devise cunning schemes, and to put on\r\nfoot all sorts of machinery to defeat McCormick.\"\r\n\r\nWhat worried McCormick most was not this consolidation of competitors,\r\nbut the fact that a few farmers had signed petitions of protest against\r\nhis claim. This was \"the most unkindest cut of all.\" But he made no\r\nattack upon them. Manufacturers he would fight, and inventors and\r\nlawyers and judges--any one and every one, if need be, except farmers.\r\n\"How can the farmers be against me?\" he asked in amazement. \"They save\r\nthe price of the Reaper in a single harvest.\"\r\n\r\nMcCormick lost his suit, as he did a second time in 1859, and a third\r\ntime in 1861. Not one of his patents was at any time renewed. Up to 1858\r\nhe had received $40,000 in royalties, but it had cost him $90,000 in\r\nlitigation. From first to last he did not get one dollar of net profit\r\nfrom the protection of the Patent Office.\r\n\r\nMany other inventors were fairly treated by Congress. Fulton, for\r\nexample, was presented with a bonus of $76,300. Willmoth, who improved\r\nthe turret of a battleship, received $50,000. Professor Page, for making\r\nan electric engine, was given $20,000. Morse was awarded $38,000. The\r\npatents of Goodyear, Kelly, Howe, Morse, Hyatt, Woodworth, and Blanchard\r\nwere extended. The protection of inventors had been a national\r\npolicy--an American tradition. In the phrasing of Daniel Webster: \"The\r\nright of an inventor to his invention is a natural right, which existed\r\nbefore the Constitution was written and which is above the\r\nConstitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe benefit of the Reaper to the nation, and the fact that McCormick was\r\nits inventor, were admitted freely enough. Senator Johnson, of Maryland,\r\nestimated in 1858 that the Reaper was then worth to the United States\r\n$55,000,000 a year. D. P. Holloway, the Commissioner of Patents, sang an\r\nanthem of eloquent praise to McCormick in 1861. \"He is an inventor whose\r\nfame, while he is yet living, has spread through the world,\" he said.\r\n\"His genius has done honor to his own country, and has been the\r\nadmiration of foreign nations. He will live in the grateful recollection\r\nof mankind as long as the reaping-machine is employed in gathering the\r\nharvest.\" Then, in an abrupt postscript to so fine a eulogy, this\r\nextraordinary Commissioner adds: \"But the Reaper is of too great value\r\nto the public to be controlled by any individual, and the extension of\r\nhis patent is refused.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAINTING BY C.

Howe, sewing machine.]\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that McCormick was too strong, too aggressive, to\r\nreceive fair play at the hands of any legislative body. The note of\r\nsympathy could never be struck in his favor. He personally directed his\r\nown cases. He dominated his own lawyers. And he fought always in an\r\nold-fashioned, straight-from-the-shoulder way that put him at a great\r\ndisadvantage in a legal conflict. Also, he was supposed to be much\r\nricher than in reality he was. He had made money by the rise in Chicago\r\nreal estate. By 1866 he had become a millionaire. And his entire fortune\r\nwas assumed by opposing lawyers to be the product of the Reaper\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIt is to be said, to the lasting honor of South Carolina, that she gave\r\na grant of money to Whitney, out of the public treasury, as a token of\r\ngratitude for the invention of the cotton gin. But no wheat State ever\r\ngave, or proposed to give, any grant or vote of thanks to Cyrus\r\nMcCormick for the invention of the Reaper. The business that he\r\nestablished was never at any time favored by a tariff, or franchise, or\r\npatent extension, or tax exemption, or land grant, or monopoly.\r\nSingle-handed he built it up, and single-handed he held it against all\r\ncomers. If, as Emerson has said, an institution is no more than \"the\r\nlengthened shadow of one man,\" we may fairly say that the immense\r\nMcCormick Company of to-day is no more than the lengthened shadow of\r\nthis farm-bred Virginian.\r\n\r\nBy 1855 McCormick realized that the Federal Government was not the\r\nimpartial tribunal that he had believed it to be. He saw that he could\r\nnot depend upon it for protection, so he made a characteristic\r\ndecision--he resolved to protect himself. He, too, would hire a battery\r\nof lawyers and charge down upon these manufacturers who were\r\nunrighteously making his Reaper and depriving him of his patents. He\r\nengaged three of the master lawyers of the American bar, William H.\r\nSeward, E. N. Dickerson, and Senator Reverdy Johnson, and brought suit\r\nagainst Manny and Emerson, of Rockford, Illinois, for making McCormick\r\nReapers without a license.\r\n\r\nThen came a three-year struggle that shook the country and did much to\r\nshape the history of the American people. Manny and Emerson, who were\r\nshrewd and forceful men, hired twice as many lawyers as McCormick and\r\nprepared to defend themselves. They selected as the members of this\r\nlegal bodyguard, Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas, Edwin M. Stanton,\r\nPeter H. Watson, George Harding, and Congressman H. Winter Davis.\r\n\r\nIt was a battle of giants. Greek met Greek with weapons of eloquence.\r\nBut Stanton out-classed his great co-debaters in a speech of\r\nunanswerable power which unfortunately was not reported. The speech so\r\nvividly impressed McCormick that in his next lawsuit he at once engaged\r\nStanton. It awoke the brain of Lincoln, as he afterwards admitted; and\r\ndrove him back to a more comprehensive study of the law. It gave Lincoln\r\nso high an opinion of Stanton's ability that, when he became President\r\nseveral years later, he chose Stanton to be his Secretary of War. And it\r\ngripped judge and jury with such effect that McCormick lost his case. It\r\nwas a wonderful speech.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln, who made no speech at all, was the one who derived the\r\nmost benefit in the end from this lawsuit. It not only aroused his\r\nambitions, but gave him his first big fee--$1,000. This money came to\r\nhim at the precise moment when he needed it most, to enable him to enter\r\ninto the famous debate with Douglas--the debate that made him the\r\ninevitable candidate of the Republican party. It is interesting to note\r\nhow closely the destinies of Lincoln and McCormick were interwoven. Both\r\nwere born in 1809, on farms in the South. Both struggled through a youth\r\nof adversity and first came into prominence in Illinois. Both labored to\r\npreserve the Union, and when the War of Secession came it was the Reaper\r\nthat enabled Lincoln to feed his armies. Both men were emancipators, the\r\none from slavery and the other from famine; and both to-day sleep under\r\nthe soil of Illinois. No other two Americans had heavier tasks than\r\nthey, and none worked more mightily for the common good.\r\n\r\nOf all McCormick's lawsuits, and they were many, the most extraordinary\r\nwas the famous Baggage Case, which lasted for twenty-three years--from\r\n1862 to 1885. It was probably the best single instance of the man's\r\ndogged tenacity in defence of a principle. The original cause of this\r\ntrial was a comedy of mishaps. A McCormick family party of six, with\r\nnine trunks, boarded a train at Philadelphia for Chicago. The train was\r\nabout to start, when the baggage-master demanded pay for 200 pounds of\r\nsurplus baggage. The amount was only $8.70, but McCormick refused to pay\r\nit. He called his family out of the train and ordered that his trunks be\r\ntaken off. The conductor refused to hold the train, and the trunks were\r\ncarried away. Mr. McCormick at once saw the president of the railroad,\r\nJ. Edgar Thompson, who telegraphed an order for the trunks to be put off\r\nat Pittsburg. The McCormicks set out for Chicago by the next train. At\r\nPittsburg they learned that the trunks had been carried through to\r\nChicago. And the next day, in Chicago, when McCormick went to the Fort\r\nWayne depot, he found it a mass of smoking cinders. It had caught fire\r\nin the night, and the nine trunks had been destroyed.\r\n\r\nMcCormick sued the railroad for $7,193--the value of the trunks and\r\ntheir contents. Repeatedly he won and repeatedly the railroad appealed\r\nto higher courts. After twenty years the worn and battered case was\r\ncarried up to the nine Justices of the United States Supreme Court. They\r\ndecided for McCormick. But even then the railroad evaded payment for\r\nthree years, until after McCormick's death. Then the president of the\r\nroad signed a check for $18,060.79, which was the original value of the\r\nnine trunks plus twenty-three years' interest.\r\n\r\nMcCormick did not for a moment regard this case as trivial. It involved\r\na principle. Once when a friend bantered him for fighting so hard over a\r\nsmall matter, he replied, \"My conscience, sir! I don't know what would\r\nbecome of the American people if there were not some one to stand up for\r\nfair dealing.\" His victory did much to teach the railroads better\r\nmanners and a finer consideration of the travelling public. Soon after\r\nthe conclusion of the case, a trunk belonging to a relative of the\r\nMcCormicks was destroyed on the New York Central. It value was $1,300,\r\nand one of the railroad's lawyers promptly sent a check, saying, \"We\r\ndon't want to have a lawsuit with the McCormicks.\"\r\n\r\nFor these numerous lawsuits McCormick paid a terrible price, both in\r\nmoney and friendship. He acquired a reputation as \"a man who would law\r\nyou to death.\" He brought down upon himself to a remarkable degree the\r\nhostility of his competitors, and prevented himself from receiving the\r\nfull credit and prestige that he deserved. Instead of being revered as\r\nthe father of the Reaper business, he was feared as an industrial\r\nBismarck--a man of unyielding will and indomitable purpose, who regarded\r\nhis competitors as a pack of trespassers in an empire that belonged by\r\nright to him.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that this situation did not arise because of the natural\r\nperversity of either McCormick or his competitors. In his later life,\r\nMcCormick proved that he could co-operate with his equals in the most\r\nharmonious way, in a new business enterprise. His competitors, too, were\r\nfor the most part men of ability and uprightness. Neither in their\r\npublic nor private lives, was there any stain upon the honor of such men\r\nas Wood, Osborne, Adriance, Manny, Emerson, Huntley, Warder. Bushnell,\r\nGlessner, Jones, and Lewis Miller. But these men were all newcomers.\r\nThey were beardless striplings compared to McCormick. He had made and\r\nexhibited a successful Reaper twenty years before the first of them\r\nbegan. His father had grappled with the problem of the Reaper before\r\nmost of them were born. It was inevitable, therefore, that there should\r\nhave been an unspanable gap between the two points of view. McCormick\r\nstood alone because he _was_ alone. He and the Reaper had grown up\r\ntogether in long hazardous years of pioneering, through ridicule and\r\npoverty and failure. It was his dream come true. And in the same spirit\r\nwith which he had fought to create it, he also fought to hold it, and to\r\nprotect it from men to whom it was not a dream and a life-mission, but a\r\nmere machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE REAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the varieties of difficulties that confronted Cyrus H. McCormick\r\nduring his strenuous life, the most baffling and disconcerting\r\ndifficulty was when his Reaper began to grow. For fifteen years--from\r\n1845 to 1860--it had remained unchanged except that seats had been added\r\nfor the raker and the driver. It did no more than cut the grain and\r\nleave it on the ground in loose bundles. It had abolished the sickler\r\nand the cradler; but there yet remained the raker and the binder. Might\r\nit not be possible, thought the restless American brain, to abolish\r\nthese also and leave no one but the driver?\r\n\r\nThis at once became a most popular and fascinating problem for\r\ninventors. There was by this time everything to gain and nothing to lose\r\nby improving the Reaper. There was no opposition and no ridicule. To cut\r\ngrain by horse-power had become, of course, the only proper way of\r\ncutting it. As many as 20,000 Reapers of all kinds were made in 1860;\r\nand McCormick's factory had grown to be the pride of Chicago. It was 90\r\nby 150 feet in size, two stories high, and gave work to about a hundred\r\nand twenty men.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1852 a fantastic self-rake Reaper had been invented by a\r\nmechanical genius named Jearum Atkins. This man was a bed-ridden\r\ncripple, who, to while away the tiresome hours of his confinement,\r\nbought a McCormick Reaper, had it placed outside his window, and\r\nactually devised an attachment to it which automatically raked off the\r\ncut grain in bundles. It was a grotesque contrivance. The farmers\r\nnicknamed it the \"Iron Man.\" It consisted of an upright post, with two\r\nrevolving iron arms. These arms whirled stiffly around, windmill\r\nfashion, and scraped the grain from the platform to the ground.\r\n\r\nAn amusing anecdote of this machine was told by Henry Wallace, known to\r\nall farmers of the Middle West as the founder of _Wallace's Farmer_.\r\n\"The first Reaper that my father bought,\" said Mr. Wallace, \"was a\r\nMcCormick machine that had an 'Iron Man' on it. The first day that it\r\nwas driven into the grain it made such a clatter that the horses ran\r\naway. It was certainly a terrifying sight as it rattled through the\r\nwheat, with its long, rake-fingered arms flying and hurling the cut\r\ngrain in the wildest disorder. It was as good as a chariot race in a\r\ncircus to the crowd of farmers, who had come to see how the new machine\r\nwould operate. The next day my father tried again. There had been rain\r\nduring the night, and the heavy machine stuck fast in the mud. It had\r\ncost $300, but my father took the 'Iron Man' off, and during the\r\nremainder of that harvest we raked off the grain by hand.\"\r\n\r\nA great variety of self-rake Reapers soon appeared, and after 1860 the\r\nfarmers would buy no other kind. Thus a part of the problem had been\r\nsolved. The raker was abolished. There now remained the much more\r\ndifficult work of supplanting the binder--the man, or sometimes woman,\r\nwho gathered up the bundles of cut grain, and, making a crude rope of\r\nthe grain itself, bound it tightly around the middle, making what was\r\ncalled a sheaf. This was hard, back-breaking work, intolerable when the\r\nsun was hot, except to men of the strongest physique. It required not\r\nstrength only, but skill. Ninety-nine farmers out of a hundred believed\r\nthat it would always have to be done by hand. \"How can it be possible,\"\r\nthey asked, \"that a machine which is being dragged by horses over a\r\nrough field can at the same time be picking up grain and tying knots?\"\r\n\r\nJust then two young farmers near De Kalb came to the rescue by inventing\r\na new species of machine. It was neither a Reaper nor a self-binder. It\r\nwas half-way between the two. It was the missing link. It appeared that\r\nan inventor named Mann had taken a McCormick Reaper and built a moving\r\nplatform upon it, in such a way that the grain was carried up to a wagon\r\nwhich was drawn alongside. These two young farmers had bought a Mann\r\nmachine, and one of them, when he saw it in operation, originated a\r\nbrilliant idea.\r\n\r\n\"Why should the grain be carried up to a wagon?\" he asked. \"Why can't\r\nwe put a foot-board on the machine, for two of us to stand on, and then\r\nbind the grain as fast as it is carried up?\"\r\n\r\nThis was the origin of the \"Marsh Harvester,\" which held the field for\r\nten years or longer. It did not abolish the man who bound, but it gave\r\nhim a chance to work twice as fast. It compelled him to be quick. It\r\nsaved him the trouble of walking from bundle to bundle. It enabled him\r\nto stand erect. And best of all, it put half a dozen inventors on the\r\nright line of thought. Plainly, what was needed now was to teach a Marsh\r\nHarvester to tie knots.\r\n\r\nOne evening in 1874 a tall man, with a box under his arm, walked\r\ndiffidently up the steps of the McCormick home in Chicago, and rang the\r\nbell. He asked to see Mr. McCormick, and was shown into the parlor,\r\nwhere he found Mr. McCormick, sitting as usual in a large and\r\ncomfortable chair.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Withington,\" said the stranger. \"I live in Janesville,\r\nWisconsin. I have here a model of a machine that will automatically\r\nbind grain.\" Now, it so happened that McCormick had been kept awake\r\nnearly the whole of the previous night by a stubborn business problem.\r\nHe could scarcely hold his eyelids apart. And when Withington was in the\r\nmidst of his explanation, with the intentness of a born inventor,\r\nMcCormick fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAt such a reception to his cherished machine, Withington lost heart. He\r\nwas a gentle, sensitive man, easily rebuffed, and so, when McCormick\r\naroused from his nap, Withington had departed and was on his way back to\r\nWisconsin. For a few seconds McCormick was uncertain as to whether his\r\nvisitor had been a reality or a dream. Then he awoke with a start into\r\ninstant action. A great opportunity had come to him and he had let it\r\nslip. He was at this time making self-rake Reapers and Marsh Harvesters;\r\nbut what he wanted--what every Reaper manufacturer wanted in 1874--was a\r\nself-binder. He at once called to him one of his trusted workmen.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to go to Janesville,\" he said. \"Find a man named Withington,\r\nand bring him to me by the first train that comes back to Chicago.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day Withington was brought back and treated with the utmost\r\ncourtesy. McCormick studied his invention and found it to be a most\r\nremarkable mechanism. Two steel arms caught each bundle of grain,\r\nwhirled a wire tightly around it, fastened the two ends together with a\r\ntwist, cut it loose and tossed it to the ground. This self-binder was\r\nperfect in all its details--as neat and effective a machine as could be\r\nimagined. McCormick was delighted. At last, here was a machine that\r\nwould abolish the binding of grain by hand.\r\n\r\nA bargain was made with Withington on the spot; and the following July a\r\nself-binder was tried on the Sherwood farm, near Elgin, Illinois. It cut\r\nfifty acres of wheat and bound every bundle without a slip. From this\r\ntime onwards no one was needed but a man, a boy, a girl, anybody, who\r\ncould hold the reins and drive a team of horses. Of the ten or twelve\r\nsweating drudges who toiled in the harvest-field, all were now to be set\r\nfree--the sicklers, cradlers, rakers, binders--every one except the\r\ndriver, and he (or she) was to have the glory of riding on the triumphal\r\nchariot of a machine that did all the work itself.\r\n\r\n\"There were ten men working in my wheat-field in the old days,\" said an\r\nIllinois farmer. \"But to-day our hired girl climbs upon the spring seat\r\nof a self-binder and does the whole business.\"\r\n\r\nMcCormick was not the first to make one of these magical machines. There\r\nwas an able and enterprising manufacturer in New York State, Walter A.\r\nWood, who in 1873 had made three Withington binders, under the\r\nsupervision of Sylvanus D. Locke, who had been a co-worker with\r\nWithington. McCormick had given Wood his start, as early as 1853, by\r\nselling him a license to make Reapers; and Wood, by his high personal\r\nqualities, had built up a most extensive business. But McCormick was the\r\nfirst to make self-binders upon a large scale. He made 50,000 of the\r\nWithington machines, and pushed them with irresistible energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST McCORMICK SELF-RAKE REAPING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nHe originated a new method of advertising the self-binders among the\r\nfarmers. Special flat-cars were provided for him by the railroads. Upon\r\neach one of these cars a binder was placed, in the charge of an expert.\r\nThese cars, during the harvest season, were attached to ordinary freight\r\ntrains; and whenever the train came to a busy wheat-field it was stopped\r\nfor an hour or more, the self-binder was rushed from the car to the\r\nfield, and an exhibition of its skill given to the wondering farmers.\r\nThen it was put back on its car, and the train resumed its leisurely\r\ncourse until it arrived at the next scene of harvesting.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive-natured inventor, Charles B. Withington, who gave such\r\ntimely aid to McCormick, was one of the most romantic knights-errant of\r\nindustry in his generation. Born near Akron a year before McCormick\r\ninvented his Reaper, he was trained by his father to be a watchmaker. At\r\nfifteen, to earn some pocket-money, he went into the harvest field to\r\nbind grain. He was not robust, and the hard, stooping labor under a hot\r\nsun would sometimes bring the blood to his head in a hemorrhage. There\r\nwere times after the day's work was done when he was too weary to walk\r\nhome, and would throw himself upon the stubble to rest.\r\n\r\nAt eighteen he set out to find his fortune in the far West, became a\r\nForty-niner, drifted to Australia, and in 1855 came back to Janesville,\r\nWisconsin, with three thousand dollars or more in his belt. All this\r\nmoney he proceeded to fritter away on the invention of a self-rake\r\nReaper--\"a crazy scheme,\" as the townspeople called it. As it happened,\r\nthe whole southern region of Wisconsin was being stirred up at that time\r\nby the speeches of an inventive Madison editor, who went by the name of\r\n\"Pump\" Carpenter. Carpenter's hobby was that the binding of grain must\r\nbe done by machinery. He was eloquent and popular, and his arguments\r\nwere substantiated by a little model which he was accustomed to carry\r\nabout with him. Withington heard him speak and was converted. He dropped\r\nhis self-rake reaper and went to work upon a self-binder. He completed\r\nhis first machine in 1872, and was thrust from one discouragement to\r\nanother until two years later he met McCormick.\r\n\r\nIt is a most interesting fact, and certainly not an accidental one, that\r\nthe group of noted inventors who together produced the self-binder all\r\nappeared from the region south of Madison, which had been so aroused by\r\nthe eloquence of \"Pump\" Carpenter. Besides C. B. Withington, there were\r\nSylvanus D. Locke, also of Janesville, H. A. Holmes, of Beloit, John F.\r\nAppleby, of Mazomanie, W. W. Burson, Jacob Behel, George H. Spaulding,\r\nand Marquis L. Gorham, of Rockford.\r\n\r\nUntil 1880, all went well with McCormick and the Withington self-binder.\r\nApparently, the process of invention had ceased. The Reaper had become\r\nof age. This miraculous wire-twisting machine was working everywhere\r\nwith clock-like precision, and was believed to be the best that human\r\ningenuity could devise. Then, like a bolt of lightning from a blue sky,\r\ncame the news that William Deering had made and sold 3,000 _twine_\r\nself-binders, and that the farmers had all at once become prejudiced\r\nagainst the use of wire. Wire, they said, got mixed with the straw and\r\nkilled their cattle. Wire fell in the wheat and made trouble in the\r\nflour-mills. Wire cut their hands. Wire cluttered up their barn-yards.\r\nThey would have no more to do with wire. What they wanted and must have\r\nwas _twine_.\r\n\r\nWilliam Deering, the newcomer who had caused this disturbance, became in\r\na flash McCormick's ablest competitor. He had entered the business eight\r\nyears before with a running start, having been a successful dry goods\r\nmerchant in Maine. His geneology in the harvester industry shows that he\r\nhad become an active partner of E. H. Gammon in 1872. Gammon, who had\r\nformerly been a Methodist preacher in Maine, had started as an agent for\r\nSeymour and Morgan of Brockport, which firm had been licensed by\r\nMcCormick in 1845. Deering was the first highly skilled business man to\r\nenter the harvester trade. He was not a farmer's son, like McCormick. He\r\nwas city-bred and factory trained. And in 1880 he staked practically his\r\nwhole fortune upon the making of 3,000 twine self-binders, and won.\r\n\r\nCyrus McCormick saw at a glance that the wire self-binder must go. It\r\nwas his policy to give the farmers what they wanted, rather than to\r\nforce upon them an unpopular machine. So he called to his aid a\r\nmechanical genius named Marquis L. Gorham--one of those who had been\r\nlured into the quest of a self-binder by the insistence of \"Pump\"\r\nCarpenter. Gorham's most valuable contribution was a self-sizing device,\r\nby which all bound sheaves were made to be the same size. By the time\r\nthat the grain stood ripe and yellow the following season, Gorham had\r\nprepared a twine self-binder that worked well, and McCormick, yielding\r\nto this sudden hostility against wire, pushed the Gorham machine with\r\nthe full force of his great organization.\r\n\r\nThis evolution of the Reaper into the twine self-binder was a momentous\r\nevent. It tremendously increased the sales. There were 60,000 machines\r\nof all kinds sold in 1880, and 250,000 in 1885. And it strikingly\r\ndecreased the number of manufacturers. There were a hundred or more\r\nuntil the appearance of the twine binder: and all but twenty-two fell\r\nout of the race. Some of these were driven out by the expensive war of\r\npatents that now ensued. But most of them gave up the contest for lack\r\nof capital. The era of big production had arrived, and the little\r\nhand-labor shops could not produce an intricate self-binder for the low\r\nprice at which they were being sold.\r\n\r\nEven McCormick lost heavily at first, before a truce was called in this\r\nbattle of the binders. One lawsuit cost him more than $225,000 and one\r\nexperiment, with what was called a \"low-down\" binder, cost him $80,000.\r\nHe was as determined as ever not to be beaten; and although he was at\r\nthis time over seventy years of age, and sorely crippled by rheumatism,\r\nhe straightway entered into a trade war with Deering, which was not\r\nended until 1902. Many of the older workmen who are now employed in the\r\nMcCormick works can remember the stress and strain of those battling\r\nyears, and how their indomitable old leader, at times when he was\r\nunable to walk, would have himself pushed in a wheeled chair through the\r\nvarious buildings of his immense plant, to make sure that every part of\r\nthe great mechanism was working smoothly.\r\n\r\nOf all the competitors who had fought him in the early days, before the\r\nCivil War, there were few now remaining. Hussey, his first antagonist,\r\nhad sold out to a mowing machine syndicate in 1861. Emerson, Seymour,\r\nand Morgan had decided not to make self-binders. Jerome Fassler, of\r\nSpringfield, Ohio, took his fortune of two million dollars and went to\r\nNew York City in 1882 with a scheme to build a subway. Manny was dead,\r\nand very few were living of those who had seen the Reaper of 1831.\r\n\r\nJohn P. Adriance, of Poughkeepsie, had survived. He was a gentle-natured\r\nman, who was content with a small and safe percentage of the business.\r\nByron E. Huntley, of Batavia, had also built up a small, but solidly\r\nbased, enterprise. He had been the office-boy, in 1845, in the factory\r\nwhere the first hundred McCormick Reapers were made; and he had been a\r\nmanufacturer on his own account since 1850. He, too, was a quiet,\r\ndignified man, very highly esteemed in both the United States and\r\nEurope. Lewis Miller, who deserves most credit as the creator of the\r\nmower, continued to do business at Akron. Mr. Miller was almost equally\r\nfamous as a Methodist and the originator of the Chautauqua idea. At\r\nAuburn, N. Y., David M. Osborne was fighting manfully to keep in the\r\nrace. He had built seven Reapers as early as 1856; and had made many\r\nfriends by his ability and uprightness. At Hoosick Falls, N. Y., there\r\nwas Walter A. Wood--a most competent and enterprising man; at Plano,\r\nIllinois, there was William H. Jones--self-made and as honest as the\r\nsoil; and at Springfield, Ohio, were the picturesque William N. Whiteley\r\nand the powerful company of Warder, Bushnell, and Glessner. Whiteley was\r\nan inventor who had changed a McCormick Reaper into what he called a\r\n\"combined machine\"--a combined Reaper and mower. And Warder, Bushnell,\r\nand Glessner had begun to make McCormick Reapers, by means of a license\r\nfrom Seymour and Morgan, in 1852.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRUS HALL McCORMICK, 1858]\r\n\r\nSuch were the most notable men who, together with McCormick and Deering,\r\nbegan in 1880 or soon afterwards to manufacture the new knot-tying\r\ndevice that had become necessary to the Reaper. As for Cyrus H.\r\nMcCormick himself, he lived to see it the universal grain-cutter of all\r\ncivilized countries. He lived to see it perfected into one of the most\r\nastonishing mechanisms known to man--an almost rational machine that\r\ncuts the grain, carries it on a canvas escalator up to steel hands that\r\nshape it into bundles, tie a cord around it as neatly as could be done\r\nby a sailor, and cut the cord; after which the bound sheaf is pushed\r\ninto a basket and held until five of them have been collected, whereupon\r\nthey are dropped carefully upon the ground.\r\n\r\nSince 1884 there has been no essential change in the fashion of the\r\nself-binder. It is the same to-day as when McCormick was alive. In the\r\nspan of his single life the Reaper was born and grew to its full\r\nmaturity. He saw its Alpha and its Omega. Best of all, he saw not only\r\nits humble arrival, in a remote Virginia settlement, but, as we shall\r\nsee, he saw it become the plaything of Emperors, the marvel of Siberian\r\nplainsmen, the liberator of the land-serf in twenty countries, and the\r\nbread-machine of one-half of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 1850 Cyrus H. McCormick was ready for new business. He now had a\r\nfactory of his own, and the assistance of his brothers, William and\r\nLeander. He had a score of busy agents and a few thousand dollars in the\r\nbank. He had fought down the ridicule of the farm-hands. It was only six\r\nyears since he had set out from his Virginian farm with $300 in his belt\r\nand the Idea of the Reaper in his brain; but in those six years he had\r\nworked mightily and succeeded. His Reapers were now clicking merrily in\r\nmore than three thousand American wheat-fields. So, it was a natural\r\nthing that in the first flush of victory, he should look across the sea\r\nfor \"more worlds to conquer.\"\r\n\r\nThere was at that time no general demand for Reapers in any European\r\ncountry. Labor was plentiful and cheap--forty cents a day in Great\r\nBritain and about half as much in Germany and France. In Austria and\r\nRussia the farm laborers received no wages at all. They were serfs.\r\nThere was no economic reason why serfs should be replaced by machinery.\r\nThey had first to become free and expensive to employ, before this\r\nReaper, this product of a free republic, could set them free from the\r\ndrudgery of the harvest.\r\n\r\nEngland had been the first European country to abolish this serfdom.\r\nSeveral centuries before, the ravages of the Black Death had made farm\r\nlaborers so scarce that their rights had begun to be respected. Also,\r\nthe upgrowth of the factory system and the development of English\r\nshipping had called thousands of men away from the fields, and raised\r\nthe wages of those who were left behind. And the falling off in profits\r\nwas compelling many English land-owners to study better methods of\r\nfarming, and to favor the introduction of farm machinery.\r\n\r\nFortunately for McCormick, he had no sooner begun to think of foreign\r\ntrade than there came the famous London Exposition of 1851. This mammoth\r\nExhibition was to Great Britain what the Chicago World's Fair of 1893\r\nwas to the United States--magnificent evidence of industrial progress.\r\nIts main promoter had been Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria,\r\nand its success gave the keenest pleasure to the young Queen. In a\r\nletter written to the King of the Belgians, she thus describes her\r\nimpressions upon the opening day:\r\n\r\n\"My dearest Uncle,\" she writes, \"I wish you could have witnessed the 1st\r\nMay, 1851, the _greatest_ day in our history, the _most beautiful_ and\r\n_imposing_ and _touching_ spectacle ever seen, and the triumph of my\r\nbeloved Albert. Truly it was astonishing, a fairy scene. Many cried, and\r\nall felt touched and impressed with devotional feelings. It was the\r\n_happiest, proudest_ day in my life, and I can think of nothing else.\r\nYou will be astounded at this great work when you see it. The beauty of\r\nthe building and the vastness of it all!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowning jewel of this Exposition was the priceless Koh-i-noor\r\ndiamond, which the Queen had received from India the previous year, and\r\nhad loaned to the Exposition managers. For five thousand years, so the\r\nlegend ran, this diamond had been one of the most precious treasures of\r\nAsia. It had been worn by the hero Karna. And it had been so often the\r\nmost coveted prize in war that there was a Hindoo saying--\"Whoever\r\npossesses the Koh-i-noor has conquered his enemies.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the courts of Europe had sent some dazzling treasure. There were\r\ntapestries from the Viceroy of Egypt, and rugs from the Sultan of\r\nTurkey, and silks from the King of Spain. There were marbles from Paris,\r\nand paintings from Dresden, and embroideries from Vienna. And in the\r\nmidst of this resplendent Exposition, surrounded and outshone by the\r\nexhibits of Russia, Austria, and France, lay a shabby collection of odds\r\nand ends from the United States.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks the American department was the joke of the Exposition.\r\nIt was nicknamed the \"Prairie Ground.\" It had no jewels, nor silks, nor\r\ngolden candelabra. There were only such preposterous things as Dick's\r\nPress, Borden's Meat Biscuit, St. John's Soap, and McCormick's Reaper.\r\nThis last contraption was the most preposterous of all. It was said to\r\nbe \"a cross between an Astley chariot, a wheelbarrow, and a\r\nflying-machine.\" It was unlike anything else that English eyes had ever\r\nseen, and by all odds the queerest and most ungainly thing that lay\r\nunder the glass roof of the Crystal Palace. Undeniably it was the \"Ugly\r\nDuckling\" of the American exhibit.\r\n\r\nBut one day there came to the Reaper booth a remarkable Anglo-Italian\r\nnamed John J. Mechi. His father had been the barber of George III., and\r\nhe himself, by the invention of a \"Magic Razor Strop,\" had made a\r\nfortune. His hobby was scientific farming, and he was hungry for new\r\nmethods and new ideas. At the time of the Exposition, his farm, which\r\nlay not far from London, had become the most famous experimental ground\r\nin England. Therefore, when he spied this new contrivance called a\r\nReaper, he proposed that it be taken out to his farm and put to the\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nThis was done on July twenty-fourth. In spite of a pouring rain, there\r\nwere present a group of judges and two hundred farmers. Lord Ebrington\r\nwas there, and Prince Frederick of Holstein, and several other titled\r\nagriculturists. One other machine was to be tested, besides McCormick's.\r\nIt was put into the grain first and was at once seen to be a failure. It\r\nbroke down the grain instead of cutting it. Seeing this mishap, several\r\nof the farmers said to Mr. Mechi, \"You had better stop this trial,\r\nbecause it is destroying your grain.\" Whereupon Mr. Mechi made one of\r\nthe noblest replies that can be found in the annals of progress.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is a great experiment for the benefit of my\r\ncountry. When a new principle is about to be established, individual\r\ninterests must always give way. If it is necessary for the success of\r\nthis test, you may take my seventy acres of wheat.\"\r\n\r\nThen came the McCormick Reaper, driven by an expert named Mackenzie. It\r\nswept down the field like a chariot of war, with whirling reel and\r\nclattering blade--seventy-four yards in seventy seconds. It was a\r\nmiracle. Such a thing had never before been seen by Europeans. \"This is\r\na triumph for the American Reaper,\" said the delighted Mechi. \"It has\r\ndone its work completely; and the day will come when this machine will\r\ncut all the grain in England. Now,\" he continued, swinging his hat, \"let\r\nus, as Englishmen, show our appreciation by giving three hearty English\r\ncheers.\"\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley, who was present on this occasion, described the victory\r\nof the McCormick Reaper as follows:--\"It came into the field to confront\r\na tribunal already prepared for its condemnation. Before it stood John\r\nBull--burly, dogged, and determined not to be humbugged,--his judgment\r\nmade up and his sentence ready to be recorded. There was a moment, and\r\nbut a moment, of suspense; then human prejudice could hold out no\r\nlonger; and burst after burst of involuntary cheers from the whole crowd\r\nproclaimed the triumph of the Yankee Reaper. In seventy seconds\r\nMcCormick had become famous. He was the lion of the hour; and had he\r\nbrought five hundred Reapers with him, he could have sold them all.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the \"Ugly Duckling\" had become a swan. The glory of the Reaper\r\nbegan to rival that of the Koh-i-noor. McCormick was given not only a\r\nFirst Prize but a Council Medal, such as was usually awarded only to\r\nKings and Governments. The London _Times_, which had led the jeering,\r\nbecame now the loudest in the chorus of approval. \"The Reaping machine\r\nfrom the United States,\" said the _Times_ editor, \"is the most valuable\r\ncontribution from abroad, to the stock of our previous knowledge, that\r\nwe have yet discovered. It is worth the whole cost of the Exposition.\"\r\nAlso, speaking on behalf of the English people, Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer\r\nsaid, \"For all manly and practical purposes, the place of the United\r\nStates is at the head of the poll. Where, out of America, shall we get a\r\npistol like Mr. Colt's, to kill our eight enemies in a second, or a\r\nreaping machine like Mr. McCormick's, to clear out twenty acres of wheat\r\nin a day?\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this Exposition gave the United States its first\r\nopportunity to answer the unpleasant questions that Sidney Smith had\r\nasked in 1820. What have the Americans done, he had asked, for the arts\r\nand sciences? Where are their Arkwrights, their Watts, their Davys?\r\nHere he was answered by the McCormick Reaper, the Colt revolver, the\r\nHobbs lock, the Morse telegraph, the Howe sewing-machine, the Deere\r\nplow, and the Hoe press. And, as if to make the triumph of American\r\ninvention complete, it was in this year that the yacht _America_ easily\r\nout-classed the famous yachts of England in a great race at Cowes, and\r\nthat the American steamer _Baltic_, of the Collins Line, broke all the\r\nocean records and became the speediest vessel on the high seas.\r\n\r\nThis Exposition did much for McCormick. It was the first appreciation of\r\nhis work, in a large way, that he had received. It was a welcome change\r\nafter twenty strenuous years. It gave him the distinction that a\r\nnaturally strong nature craved, and secured the friendship of such\r\neminent men as Junius Morgan, George Peabody, J. J. Mechi, and Lord\r\nGranville. From a business point of view, also, the Exposition was of\r\ngreat service to McCormick. It enabled him to draw up a new plan of\r\ncampaign for the foreign trade.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, he had made his appeal directly to the mass of the\r\nfarmers. In Europe he could not do this. The vast bulk of the farmers\r\nhere were tenants or serfs. But it was also true, he observed, that the\r\nKings of Europe, and the members of the nobility, were land-owners. Here\r\nwas his chance. He would begin at the top. He would sell his Reapers to\r\nthe kings.\r\n\r\nHe noticed that kings and queens were not the remote and inaccessible\r\npersonages that he had believed them to be. Prince Albert was plainly\r\nmore interested in farm machinery than in the Koh-i-noor. The one prize\r\nwhich was awarded to him personally was for a model cottage, in which a\r\nworkingman's family might live with greater comfort. And one morning,\r\nwhile McCormick was giving attention to his Reaper, the Queen and her\r\nten-year-old son (now the King of England) walked past and had a view of\r\nthe American Reaping machine that had been so widely ridiculed and\r\npraised.\r\n\r\nMcCormick had to hurry back to the United States, on account of a\r\npatent suit that was then in full swing; but before he left England he\r\nestablished an agency in London, and started a vigorous campaign among\r\nthe titled land-owners. He prepared a statement, showing that even at\r\nthe low rate of wages that were paid on English farms a Reaper would\r\nmean a handsome saving to English wheat-growers. But he did not depend\r\nupon the argument of economy. He placed his reliance also upon the fact\r\nthat the Reaper had become the playtoy of kings, and that their fancy\r\nwould presently make it the fashion.\r\n\r\nFour years later he went with another Reaper to an Exposition at Paris,\r\nwon the Gold Medal, and sold his machine to the Emperor. Then, in 1862,\r\nwith his wife and young son and daughter, he made his headquarters in\r\nLondon, and opened up a two-years' campaign in Great Britain, Germany,\r\nand France. Up to this time the foreign trade had grown but slowly. All\r\nEuropean countries combined were not buying more than half a million\r\ndollars' worth of farm machinery a year from Americans--less than we\r\nsell them now in five days. So McCormick exerted himself to the utmost.\r\n\r\nHe held field tests to awaken the farmers. He advertised and organized.\r\nThere were now several dozen other manufacturers in the field, all\r\nmaking Reapers more or less like McCormick's; and he gave battle to them\r\nat London, Lille, and Hamburg. After the Hamburg contest, Joseph A.\r\nWright, the United States Commissioner, cabled to New York: \"McCormick\r\nhas thrashed all nations and walked off with the Gold Medal.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1867, McCormick had a notable time at Paris. The Emperor\r\nNapoleon III., then in the last days of his inherited glory, permitted\r\nMcCormick to give a sort of Reaper _matinée_ on the royal estate at\r\nChâlons. The Emperor was present, at first on horseback, and then on\r\nfoot. The sun was hot, and presently he said to McCormick, \"If you will\r\nallow me, I'll come under your umbrella.\" So the two men, dramatically\r\ndifferent in the tendencies they represented, walked arm in arm behind\r\nthe Reaper, and watched it automatically cut and rake off the grain. The\r\nEmperor was delighted. He forgot for the moment his impending troubles,\r\nand at once offered McCormick the Cross of the Legion of Honor. This\r\nwas, in all probability, the last time that the coveted Cross was\r\nconferred in France by the hand of a sovereign; and the meeting of the\r\ntwo men was a highly impressive event, the one man typifying a falling\r\ndynasty that had risen to greatness by the sword, and the other the\r\nfounder of a new industry that was destined to bring peace and plenty to\r\nall nations alike.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, because of the clamor of McCormick's competitors, a\r\ngrand Field Test was arranged by the German Government at Altenberg.\r\nThirty-eight contestants entered the lists, and after a most exciting\r\ntournament the judges awarded the Gold Medal and a special prize of\r\nsixty ducats to McCormick. Such contests, from this time onward, came\r\nthick and fast. Several days later McCormick swept the field at Altona.\r\nIn 1873 he was decorated by the Austrian Emperor. And in 1878 the\r\nFrench Academy of Science elected him a member, for the reason that he\r\n\"had done more for the cause of agriculture than any other living man.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRUS HALL McCORMICK, 1867\r\n\r\nFrom Painting by Cabanel]\r\n\r\nFrom that time to the present day the making of Reapers and Harvesters\r\nhas remained an American business. An American machine must pay twenty\r\ndollars to enter France, and twenty-five to enter Hungary. But try as\r\nthey may, other nations cannot learn the secret of the Reaper. They\r\ncannot produce a machine that is at once so complex, so hardy, and so\r\nefficient. When Bismarck, at the close of his life, was inspecting\r\nseveral American self-binders which he had bought for his farm at\r\nFredericksruhe, he asked, \"Why do they not make these machines in\r\nGermany?\" As we have seen, had he wished a complete answer he would have\r\nhad to read the history of the United States. He would have seen that\r\nthe Reaper can be produced only in countries where labor receives a high\r\nreward, where farmers own their own acres without fear of being\r\ndespoiled by invading armies, and where the average of intelligence\r\nand enterprise is as high in the country as in the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Europe had become so dependent upon America for its reaping\r\nmachinery that 22,000 machines were shipped from the McCormick plant\r\nalone--so many that a fleet of twelve vessels had to be chartered to\r\ncarry them. There are now as many American Reapers and Harvesters in\r\nEurope as can do the work of 12,000,000 men. Of all American machines\r\nexported, the Reaper is at the head of the list. It has been the chief\r\npathfinder for our foreign trade. Four-fifths of all the harvesting\r\nmachinery in the world is made in the United States; and one-third,\r\nperhaps more, in the immense factory-city that Cyrus H. McCormick\r\nfounded in Chicago in 1847.\r\n\r\nIt was McCormick's most solid satisfaction, in his later life, to see\r\nforeign nations, one by one, adopt his invention and move up out of the\r\nFamine Zone. No news was at any time more welcome to him than the\r\ntidings that a new territory had been entered. And although the foreign\r\ntrade has been vastly multiplied in the past five or six years, he\r\nlived long enough to see his catalogue printed in twenty languages, and\r\nto know that as long as the human race continued to eat bread, the sun\r\nwould never set upon the empire of the Reaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMcCORMICK AS A MANUFACTURER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If I had given up business, I would have been dead long ago,\" said\r\nCyrus H. McCormick in 1884, only a few weeks before his death; and this\r\nstatement was by no means an exaggeration. His business was his life. It\r\nwas not a definite, walled-off fraction of his life, as with most men.\r\nIt was the whole of it. His business was his work, his play, his\r\nreligion, his grand opera, his education. There was business even in his\r\nlove-letters and his dreams.\r\n\r\nMcCormick believed in business. He had the sturdy pride of a \"John\r\nHalifax, Gentleman.\" He never wanted to be anything else but a worker.\r\nHe never wasted a breath in wishing for an easier life. He worked hard\r\nfor twenty-five years after he had made his fortune, because he believed\r\nin work and commerce and the reciprocities of trade. He was never\r\ndazzled nor deflected for a moment by the pomps and pageantries of the\r\nworld, and for the glory that springs from war he had very little\r\nrespect. In 1847, when offering a place in his factory to his brother\r\nLeander, he writes, \"This will be as honorable an enterprise as to go to\r\nMexico to be shot at.\" And in later life, in a conversation with General\r\nLilley, of Virginia, he said, \"I expect to die in the harness, because\r\nthis is not the world for rest. This is the world for work. In the next\r\nworld we will have the rest.\"\r\n\r\nIn the vast mass of letters, papers, etc., left by Mr. McCormick, there\r\nis one mention, and only one, of recreation. After his first visit to\r\nthe West, in 1844, he wrote to one of his brothers and described a\r\nhunting trip in which he shot three prairie chickens near Beloit. But\r\nduring the rest of his life, he was too busy for sport. His energy was\r\nthe wonder of his friends and the despair of his employees. His brain\r\nwas not quick. It was not marvellously keen nor marvellously intuitive.\r\nBut it was at work every waking moment, like a great engine that never\r\ntires.\r\n\r\n\"He was the most laborious worker I ever saw,\" said one of his\r\nsecretaries. One of the words that annoyed him most was _to-morrow_. He\r\nwanted things done to-day. With regard to every important piece of work,\r\nit was his instinct to \"do it now.\" He abhorred delay and dawdling. Even\r\nas a boy, when sent on an errand, he would set off upon a run. Walking\r\nwas too slow. And although he was in France on many occasions, the\r\nFrench phrase that he knew best was \"_Depechez-vous_.\"\r\n\r\nHis plan of work, so far as he could be said to have a plan, was\r\nthis--_One Thing at a Time, and the Hardest Thing First_. He followed\r\nthe line of _most_ resistance. If the hardest thing can be done, he\r\nreasoned, all the rest will follow. And as for all work that was merely\r\nroutine, he left as much as possible of it to others.\r\n\r\nHe was not an organizer so much as a creator and a pioneer. His problem\r\nwas not like that which troubles the business men of to-day. He was not\r\ngrappling with the evils of competition, nor with the higher questions\r\nof efficiency and \"community of interest.\" He was making a business that\r\nhad not existed. He was clearing away obstacles that are now wholly\r\nforgotten. Consequently, as each new difficulty appeared, he had to\r\nconsider it in all its details. He could not pass it over to Lieutenant\r\nNumber One or Lieutenant Number Two.\r\n\r\nMcCormick was like a general who was leading an army into an unknown\r\ncountry rather than like the business man of the twentieth century, who\r\ncan travel by time-table and schedule. When an obstacle blocked his\r\npath, it had to be removed; and until it was out of the way, nothing\r\nelse mattered. Thus it was impossible for McCormick to have business\r\nhours. Once his mind had applied itself to a problem, he cared nothing\r\nfor clocks and watches. Sometimes he would work on through the night,\r\nhour after hour, until the gray light of another day shone in the\r\nwindow. On all these arduous occasions, he had no idea of time, and he\r\nwould allow no distractions nor interruptions. So rigid was this grasp\r\nof his mind that if his body rebelled and he fell asleep, he would\r\ninvariably when he woke take up the matter in hand at the exact point at\r\nwhich it had been left. Not even sleep could detach his mind from a\r\ntask that was unfinished.\r\n\r\nWhen anything was going well, he let it alone. As soon as his factory\r\nwas in good running order, he gave it little attention. It was managed\r\nfirst by his brothers, William and Leander, and afterwards by such\r\nthoroughly competent men as Charles Spring and E. K. Butler. The work\r\nthat he chose to do himself was invariably new business. He cared little\r\nfor the mere making of money. The success always pleased him much more\r\nthan the profit. He was at heart a builder, and therefore when he had\r\nfinished one structure, he moved off and began another.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that as an investor, also, he had no interest in\r\nbusinesses that were already established. Stocks were offered to him,\r\nstocks that were safe and sure, but he bought none of them. The money\r\nthat he invested outside of his own business was put into pioneering\r\nenterprises. He bought land in Chicago and Arizona. He opened up gold\r\nmines in South Carolina and Montana. He supplied the capital for a\r\ncompany which set out to bring mahogany from San Domingo. He invested\r\n$55,000 in the Tehuantepec Inter-Ocean Railroad, an ambitious attempt to\r\njoin the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by rail, which was begun in 1879\r\nand came to an inglorious end several years later. And he was one of\r\nthat daring group of Americans who planned and financed the Union\r\nPacific Railway--the first road that really joined sea to sea and\r\nreached to the farthest acre in the West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McCORMICK REAPER CUTTING ON A SIDE HILL IN PENNSYLVANIA]\r\n\r\nIn all these undertakings he lost money, except in the instances of\r\nChicago real estate and the Union Pacific. By 1883 he had several\r\nhundred thousand dollars invested in gold mines, and yet had not\r\nreceived one dollar of profit. It was the fascination of pioneering that\r\nhad lured him. He saw no charm, as the gambler does, in the risk itself.\r\nThe Wall Street game he regarded as child's play. The thing that gripped\r\nhim was the developing of new material resources--the colonization of\r\nnew lands--the mastery of whatever is hostile to the welfare of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\nAnother McCormick trait, which is not usually found in men who have the\r\npioneering instinct, was _Thoroughness_. He never said, \"This is good\r\nenough,\" or \"Half a loaf is better than no bread.\" He wanted what was\r\n_right_ whether it came to him or went from him. He never believed in a\r\nninety per cent success. He wanted par. Once his mind was fully aroused\r\nupon a subject, there was no detail too petty for him to consider. He\r\nlabored hard to be correct in matters that appeared trifling to other\r\nmen. Even in his letters to members of his family, the sentences were\r\ncarefully formed, and there were no misspelled words. Once he gave\r\nadvice to a younger brother on the importance of spelling words\r\ncorrectly. \"You should carry a dictionary, as I do,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAll slovenliness, whether of mind or body, he abhorred. To take thought\r\nabout a matter and to do it as it ought to be done, was to him a matter\r\nof character as well as of business. When a telegram was submitted to\r\nhim for approval, it was his custom to draw a circle around the\r\nsuperfluous words. This was a little lesson to his managers on the\r\nimportance of brevity and exactness. He insisted that clocks and watches\r\nshould be correct, and in his later life carried a fine repeater which\r\ncould strike the hour in the night and in which he took an almost boyish\r\npride. Once, when he had been given the management of a political\r\ncampaign in Chicago, he created consternation among the politicians by\r\nthe rigid way in which he supervised the expense accounts. \"This will\r\nnever do,\" he said. \"Things are at loose ends.\" If a bill was ten cents\r\ntoo much it went back. One bill for $15 was held up for a week because\r\nit was not properly drawn. The amazed politicians could not understand\r\nsuch a man,--who would readily sign a check for $10,000, and put it in\r\nthe campaign treasury, and yet make trouble about the misplacing of a\r\ndime of other people's money.\r\n\r\nMcCormick demanded absolute honesty from his employees. One young man\r\nlost his chance of promotion because he was seen to place a two-cent\r\nstamp, belonging to the firm, on one of his personal letters. But once\r\nhe had tested a man, and found him to be pure gold, he trusted him\r\ncompletely. A new employee would be pelted with questions and complete\r\nanswers insisted upon. This was often a harsh ordeal. It was irritating\r\nto a man of independent spirit, until he realized that it was a sort of\r\ndiscipline and examination.\r\n\r\nMcCormick was always an optimist. He was not one of those who said, \"Let\r\nwell enough alone.\"\r\n\r\nHe never endured unsatisfactory business conditions. When he found that\r\nthe freight charges on Reapers from Virginia to Cincinnati were too\r\nhigh, he arranged to have Reapers built in Cincinnati. When he found\r\nthat other manufacturers were apt to be careless as to the quality of\r\ntheir materials, he built a factory of his own. Again and again in the\r\ncourse of his life, came the temptation to be satisfied with what he had\r\nalready achieved. But he could not endure the thought of being beaten.\r\nInstead of being content and complacent, he was far more likely to be\r\nplanning a wholly new policy, on larger lines.\r\n\r\nA daring proposition from a competent man always caught his attention.\r\nOnce, when he was sitting in his office, he heard E. K. Butler, who was\r\nat that time the head of his sales department, protest that the factory\r\nwas not making as many machines as it should. \"It is sheer nonsense,\"\r\nsaid Butler, \"to say that the factory is producing as much as it can. If\r\nI were at the head of it, I could double the output with very little\r\nextra expense.\" Most employers would have regarded this sort of talk as\r\nmere boastfulness, but not so McCormick. He knew that Butler was a most\r\nadaptable and competent man, so he called him into the office and\r\nstraightway appointed him to be the superintendent of the factory.\r\nButler was thus put upon his mettle. He went out to the factory resolved\r\nthat McCormick's confidence in him should not be overthrown. He routed\r\nthe wastes and inefficiencies, and keyed the whole plant up to such a\r\npitch that, in a remarkably short period, he had made good his boast and\r\ndoubled the output without hiring an extra man.\r\n\r\nBut the preëminent quality in the character of Cyrus McCormick was not\r\nhis power of concentration, nor his spirit of pioneering, nor his\r\nthoroughness. It was his strength of will--his _Tenacity_. This was the\r\nmotif of his life.\r\n\r\nHe was not at all a shrewd accumulator of millions, as many have\r\nimagined him. He had not an iota of craft and cunning. Neither was he a\r\nfinancier, in the modern sense. It would be nearer the truth to say that\r\nhe was a farmer-manufacturer, of simple nature but tremendous\r\nresolution, whose one overmastering life-purpose was to teach the wheat\r\nnations of the world to use his harvesting machinery.\r\n\r\n\"The exhibition of his powerful will was at times actually terrible,\"\r\nsaid one of his lawyers. \"If any other man on this earth ever had such a\r\nwill, certainly I have not heard of it.\"\r\n\r\nA drizzle of little annoyances and little matters always irritated him,\r\nbut he could stand up alone against a sea of adversity without a\r\nwhimper. In fact, he would sooner be asked for a thousand dollars than\r\nfor fifty cents. He would storm over the loss of a carpet slipper and\r\nsmile blandly at the loss of a lawsuit. \"He made more fuss over a\r\npin-prick,\" said one of his valets, \"than he did over a surgical\r\noperation.\" He disliked the petty odds and ends of life. His mind was\r\ntoo massive to adapt itself readily to small matters. But when a great\r\ndifficulty came in view, he rose and went at it with a sort of stern\r\nsatisfaction and religious zeal. He was so confident of his own\r\nstrength, and of the justice of his cause, that it was almost a joy to\r\nhim to--\r\n\r\n    \"Breast the blows of circumstance,\r\n    And grasp the skirts of happy chance,\r\n    And grapple with his evil star.\"\r\n\r\nA defeat never meant anything more to McCormick than a delay. Often, the\r\nharder he was thrown down the higher he would rebound. Again and again\r\nhe was thwarted and blocked. In the race of competition, there was a\r\ntime when he was beaten by Whiteley, and there was a time when he was\r\nbeaten by Deering. Most of his lawsuits were decided against him. But no\r\none ever saw him crushed or really disheartened. In 1877, after he had\r\nmade a long hard struggle to become a United States Senator, the news\r\ncame to him that he was defeated. \"Well,\" he said, \"that's over. What\r\nnext?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAPER DRAWN BY OXEN IN ALGERIA]\r\n\r\nUsually, McCormick was at his best when the situation was at its worst.\r\nHis Titanic work immediately after the great Chicago Fire of 1871 is the\r\nmost striking evidence of this. He had been living at the corner of\r\nTenth Street and Fifth Avenue, in New York City, for four years before\r\nthe Fire; but he was in Chicago during the greatest of all Illinois\r\ndisasters. In one day of fire and terror he saw his city reduced to a\r\nwaste of ashes. It was no longer a city. It was two thousand acres of\r\ndesolation. He was himself in the midst of the fire-fighting. When his\r\nwife, in response to his telegraphic message, came to him in Chicago two\r\ndays later, he met her wearing a half-burned hat and a half-burned\r\novercoat. His big factory, which was at that time making about 10,000\r\nharvesters a year, was wholly destroyed. In a flash he found himself\r\nwithout a city and without a business.\r\n\r\nBut McCormick never flinched. The arrival of a great difficulty was\r\nalways his cue. First he ascertained his wife's wishes. Did she wish\r\nthe factory to be rebuilt, or did she want him to retire from active\r\nbusiness life? She, thinking of her son, said--\"Rebuild.\" At once\r\nMcCormick became the most buoyant and confident citizen in the ruined\r\ncity. His great spirit was aroused. He called up one of his attorneys\r\nand sent him in haste to the docks to buy lumber. He telegraphed to his\r\nagents to rush in as much money as they could collect. Every bank in the\r\ncity had been burned, so for a time this money was kept by the cashier\r\nin a market basket, and carried at night to a private house. There was\r\none day as much as $24,000 in the basket. Before the cinders were cool,\r\nMcCormick had given orders to build a new factory, larger than the one\r\nthat had been burned down. More than this, he had also given orders that\r\nhis house in New York should be sold, and that a home should be\r\nestablished in Chicago. Chicago was his city. He had seen it grow from\r\n10,000 to 325,000. And in this hour of its distress he tossed aside all\r\nother plans and gave Chicago all he had.\r\n\r\nHis unconquerableness gave heart to others. Several of the wealthiest\r\ncitizens, who had lost courage, rallied to the help of the city. One\r\nmerchant, who had lost his store, borrowed $100,000 from McCormick and\r\nstarted again. And so McCormick became not only one of the main builders\r\nof the first Chicago, but also of the second Chicago, which in less than\r\nthree years had become larger and finer than the city that was.\r\n\r\nIt was this steel-fibred tenacity that was the main factor in the\r\nsuccess of McCormick, whether we consider him as a manufacturer or as a\r\ngreat American. It enabled him to establish the perilous industry of\r\nmaking harvesting machines--a business so complex and many-sided that\r\nout of every twenty manufacturers who set out to emulate McCormick, only\r\none survives to-day. It enabled McCormick to hold his own in spite of\r\nadverse litigation, the hostility of Congress, the rivalry of other\r\ninventors, and the calamity of the Great Fire. It was so remarkable, and\r\nso productive of good to his country and to himself, that he will always\r\nremain one of the creative and heroic figures in the early industrial\r\nhistory of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCYRUS H. McCORMICK AS A MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nCyrus H. McCormick was a great commercial Thor. He was six feet tall,\r\nweighed two hundred pounds, and had the massive shoulders of a wrestler.\r\nHis body was well proportioned, with small hands and feet. His hair,\r\neven in old age, was very dark and waving. His bearing was erect, his\r\nmanner often imperious, and his general appearance that of a man built\r\non large lines and for large affairs.\r\n\r\nMen of lesser caliber regarded him with fear, not for any definite\r\nreason, but because, as Seneca has said--\"In him that has power, all men\r\nconsider not what he has done, but what he may do.\" He was so strong, so\r\ndominating, so ready to crash through obstacles by sheer bulk of\r\nwill-power, that smaller men could never quite subdue a feeling of alarm\r\nwhile they were in his presence. He was impatient of small talk and\r\nsmall criticisms and small objections. He had no tact at retail, and he\r\nsaw no differences in little-minded people. All his life he had been\r\nplagued and obstructed by the Liliputians of the world, and he had no\r\npatience to listen to their chattering. He was often as rude as Carlyle\r\nto those who tied their little threads of pessimism across his path.\r\n\r\nAt fashionable gatherings he would now and then be seen--a dignified\r\nfigure; but his mind was almost too ponderous an engine to do good\r\nservice in a light conversation. If a subject did not interest him, he\r\nhad nothing to say. What gave him, perhaps, the highest degree of social\r\npleasure, was the entertaining, at his house, of such men as Horace\r\nGreeley, William H. Seward, Peter Cooper, Abram S. Hewitt, George\r\nPeabody, Junius Morgan, Cyrus W. Field, or some old friend from\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nHis long years of pioneering had made him a self-sufficient man, and a\r\nman who lived from within. He did not pick up his opinions on the\r\nstreets. His mind was not open to any chance idea. He had certain clear,\r\ndefinite convictions, logical and consistent. What he knew, he knew.\r\nThere were no hazy imaginings in his mind. The main secret of his power\r\nlay in his ability to focus all his energies upon a few subjects. Once,\r\nin 1848, he mentioned the French Revolution in one of his letters. \"It\r\nis a mighty affair,\" he wrote, \"and will be likely to stand.\" But\r\nusually he paid little attention to the world-dramas that were being\r\nenacted. He was too busy--too devoted to affairs which, if he did not\r\nattend to them, would not be attended to at all.\r\n\r\nMcCormick was a product of the Protestant Reformation, and of the\r\ncapitalistic development that came with it. The whole structure of his\r\ncharacter was based upon the two great dogmas of the Reformation--the\r\nsovereignty of God and the direct responsibility of the individual.\r\nWhoever would know the springs at which his life was fed must read the\r\nstory of Luther, Calvin, and Knox. They must call to mind the attitude\r\nof Luther at the Diet of Worms, when he faced the men who had the power\r\nto take his life and said, \"Here I stand. I can do no other.\" They must\r\nrecollect how these three men, who were leaders of nations, not sects,\r\nstood out alone against the kings and ecclesiasticisms of Europe,\r\nwithout wealth, without armies, without anything except a higher Moral\r\nIdea, and succeeded so mightily they actually changed the course of\r\nempires and became the pathfinders of the human race.\r\n\r\nMcCormick was so essentially a result of this religio-economic movement\r\nthat it is impossible to separate his religion and his business life. He\r\nwas an individualist through and through--as well marked a type of the\r\nCovenanter in commerce as the United States has ever produced. He\r\nbelieved in presbyters in religion, private capitalists in business, and\r\nelected representatives in government. He was opposed to feudalism and\r\nbureaucracy in all their myriad forms. He held the middle ground, the\r\n_via media_, between the over-organization of the fourteenth century,\r\nwhen the rights of the individual were forgotten, and the lax liberalism\r\nof to-day, when too much is left to individual whim and caprice, and\r\nwhen duties and responsibilities are too apt to be ignored.\r\n\r\nAbove all constituted authorities stood a man's own conscience. This was\r\nMcCormick's faith, and it was this that made him the fighter that he\r\nwas. It gave him courage and the fortitude that is rarer than courage.\r\nIt compelled him to oppose his own political party at the Baltimore\r\nConvention of 1861. It made him stand single-handed against his\r\nfellow-manufacturers, in defence of his rights as an inventor. It\r\nenabled him to beat down the Pennsylvania Railroad, after a twenty-three\r\nyear contest, and to prove that a great corporation cannot lawfully do\r\nan injustice to an individual.\r\n\r\nMcCormick was nourished on this virile Calvinistic faith from the time\r\nwhen he first learned to read out of the Shorter Catechism and the\r\nBible. It had been the faith of his fathers for generations, and it was\r\nbred into him from boyhood. Nevertheless, according to the practice of\r\nthe Presbyterians, there had to come a time when he himself openly made\r\nhis choice. This occasion came in 1834, when McCormick was twenty-five\r\nyears of age. A four-day meeting was being held in the little stone\r\nchurch on his grandfather's farm. Three ministers were in charge. As was\r\nthe custom, there was constant preaching from morning until sundown,\r\nwith an hour's respite for dinner. At the close of the fourth day, all\r\nwho wished to become avowed Christians were requested to stand up. Cyrus\r\nMcCormick was there, and he was not a member of the church; yet he did\r\nnot stand up. That night his father went to his bedside and gently\r\nreproached him. \"My son,\" he said, \"don't you know that your silence is\r\na public rejection of your Saviour?\" Cyrus was conscience-stricken. He\r\nleapt from his bed and began to dress himself. \"I'll go and see old\r\nBilly McClung,\" he said. Half an hour later, old Billy McClung, who was\r\na universally respected religious leader in the community, was amazed to\r\nbe called out of his sleep by a greatly troubled young man, who wanted\r\nto know by what means he might make his peace with his Maker. The next\r\nSunday this young man stood up in the church, and became in name what\r\nhe already was by nature and inheritance--a Christian of the\r\nPresbyterian faith.\r\n\r\nAfter he left home his letters to the members of his family are strewn\r\nwith scraps of religious reflection. In 1845, for instance, he writes,\r\n\"Business is not inconsistent with Christianity; but the latter ought to\r\nbe a help to the former, giving a confidence and resignation, after\r\nusing all proper means; and yet I have sometimes felt that I came so far\r\nshort of the right _feeling_, so worldly-minded, that I could wish\r\nmyself out of the world.\" On another occasion, when he was struggling\r\nwith manufacturers who had broken their contracts, he wrote, \"If it were\r\nnot for the fact that Providence has seemed to assist me in our\r\nbusiness, it has at times seemed that I would almost sink under the\r\nweight of responsibility hanging upon me; but I believe the Lord will\r\nhelp us out.\" And after his first visit to New York City, he summed up\r\nhis impressions of the metropolis in the following sentence, \"It is a\r\ndesirable place and people, with regular and good Presbyterian\r\npreaching.\"\r\n\r\nMcCormick enjoyed with all his heart the logical, doctrinal sermon. His\r\nfavorite Bible passage was the eighth chapter of Romans, that\r\nindomitable victorious chapter that ends like the blast of a trumpet:\r\n\r\n\"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or\r\ndistress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\r\nAs it is written, 'for Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are\r\naccounted as sheep for the slaughter.' Nay, in all these things we are\r\nmore than conquerors through Him that loved us; for I am persuaded that\r\nneither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor\r\nthings present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other\r\ncreature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in\r\nChrist Jesus, our Lord.\"\r\n\r\nHis favorite hymn, which he sang often and with the deepest fervor, was\r\nthat melodious prayer that begins--\r\n\r\n    \"O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,\r\n    On whom in affliction I call,\r\n    My comfort by day, and my song in the night,\r\n    My hope, my salvation, my all.\"\r\n\r\nIn his earlier journeys through the Middle West, McCormick was\r\ndistressed at the rough immorality of the new settlements. \"I see a\r\ngreat deal of profanity and infidelity in this country, enough to make\r\nthe heart sick,\" he wrote in 1845. These towns and villages needed more\r\npreachers, and better preachers, he thought. Consequently, soon after he\r\nhad acquired his first million dollars, he determined to establish the\r\nbest possible college for the education of ministers. He almost stunned\r\nwith joy the Western friends of higher education for ministers, by\r\noffering them $100,000 with which to establish a school of theology in\r\nChicago. This offer was made in 1859--half a century ago, and resulted\r\nin the removal of a moneyless and decaying Seminary at New Albany,\r\nIndiana, to Chicago. Thus was founded the Northwestern Theological\r\nSeminary, afterwards named the McCormick Theological Seminary, which, in\r\nits fifty years of life, has given a Christian education to thousands of\r\nyoung men.\r\n\r\nThirteen years later he bought _The Interior_ and made it what it has\r\nremained ever since--a religious weekly of the highest rank. These\r\ntwo--the college and the paper--were his pride and delight. He fathered\r\nthem in the most affectionate way. No matter what crisis might be\r\nimpending in the war of business, he always had time to talk to his\r\neditors and his professors. So, though McCormick had received much from\r\nhis religious inheritance, it is also true that he gave back much. His\r\nlast public speech, which was read for him by his son Cyrus because he\r\nwas too weak to deliver it himself, was given at the laying of the\r\ncorner-stone of a new building which he had given to the college. Its\r\nlast sentence was typical of McCormick--full of hope and optimism: \"I\r\nnever doubted that success would ultimately reward our efforts,\" he\r\nsaid; \"and now, on this occasion, we may fairly say that the night has\r\ngiven place to the dawn of a brighter day than any which has hitherto\r\nshone upon us.\"\r\n\r\nMcCormick went into politics, too, with the same conscientious abandon\r\nwith which he plunged into business and religion. He was a Democrat of\r\nthe Jeffersonian type. One of his keenest pleasures was to go to the\r\nSenate and listen to its debates. He was not a fluent speaker himself,\r\nbut he delighted in the orations of Clay, Calhoun, and Webster. He\r\nbelieved in politics. He thought it a public danger that the strong and\r\ncompetent men of the republic should willingly permit men of little\r\nability and low character to manage public affairs. In fact, he was\r\nalmost as much a pathfinder and pioneer in this matter as he had been in\r\nmatters of business, but without the same measure of success. Politics,\r\nhe found, was not like business. Its successes depended not upon your\r\nown efforts, but upon the votes of the majority.\r\n\r\nWhat McCormick tried to do as a citizen and a patriot was the one heroic\r\nfailure of his life. He ran for office on several occasions, but he was\r\nnever elected. He was not the sort of man who gets elected. He stood for\r\nhis whole party at a time when the average politician was standing only\r\nfor himself. He talked of \"fundamental principles\" while the other\r\nleaders, for the most part, were thinking of salaries. He gave up his\r\ntime and his money as freely for politics as he did for religion; but\r\nhe was out of his element. He was too sincere, too simple, too intent\r\nupon a larger view of public questions. He could never talk the flexible\r\nlanguage of diplomacy nor suit his theme to the prejudice of his\r\nlisteners. Usually, to the political managers and delegates with whom he\r\nfelt it his duty to co-operate, he was like a man from another world.\r\nThey could never understand him, and tolerated his leadership mainly\r\nbecause of his generous contributions. Again and again he astonished\r\nthem by developing a party speech into a sermon on national\r\nrighteousness, or by speaking nobly of a political opponent. On one\r\nmemorable occasion, for instance, in the white-hot passion of the\r\nHayes-Tilden controversy, and after he had lavished time and money in\r\nsupport of Tilden, he sprang to his feet in a Democratic convention and\r\namazed the delegates by saying: \"Mr. Hayes is not a Democrat, but he is\r\ntoo patriotic and honest to suit his party managers and we must sustain\r\nhim so far as he is right.\"\r\n\r\nHe was one of the first Americans who rose above sectional interests\r\nand party loyalties, and surveyed his country as a whole. No other man\r\nof his day, either in or out of public office, was so free from local\r\nprejudices and so intensely national in his beliefs and sympathies. He\r\nrefused to stamp himself with the label of the North or of the South. He\r\nhad been reared in the one and matured in the other. And in the ominous\r\ndays before the Civil War he strove like a beneficent giant to make the\r\nwrangling partisans listen to the voice of reason and arbitration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REAPER IN HEAVY GRAIN]\r\n\r\nHe went to the Democratic Convention at Baltimore, just before the war,\r\nand set before the Southerners the standpoint of the North. Then he\r\nbought a daily paper--_The Times_--to explain to Chicago the standpoint\r\nof the South. He wrote editorials. He made speeches. He poured into the\r\nnewspapers, day after day for two years, a large share of the profits\r\nthat he derived from his Reaper. He was no more popular as an editor\r\nthan as a political candidate. He was a maker, not a collector, of\r\npublic opinion; and instead of pandering to the war frenzy, he\r\nopposed it,--put his newspaper squarely in its path, and held it there\r\nuntil the feet of the crowd had trampled it into an impossible wreck.\r\n\r\nHe was so strong, so indomitable, this heir of the Covenanters, that\r\nwhen the war had openly begun, he strode between the North and South and\r\nlabored like a Titan to bring them to a reconciliation. He actually\r\nbelieved that he could establish peace. He proposed a plan. Horace\r\nGreeley indorsed it, and the two men, who were throughout life the\r\nclosest of comrades, undertook to bring the severed nation back to union\r\nand the paths of law.\r\n\r\nThe \"McCormick Plan,\" in a word was to call immediately two\r\nconventions--one to represent the Democrats of the North and the other\r\nthe Democrats of the South. These conventions would elect delegates to a\r\nboard of arbitration, which would consider the various causes of the war\r\nand arrange a just basis upon which both sides could agree to disband\r\ntheir armies and reëstablish peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, too, almost before the nation had finished counting its\r\ndead, it was Cyrus H. McCormick whose voice was first heard in favor of\r\nchurch unity. Among the many speeches and letters of his which have been\r\npreserved, the most beautifully phrased paragraph is the ending of an\r\narticle that he published in 1869, protesting against the invasion of\r\npolitical partisanism into the religious life.\r\n\r\n\"When are we to look for the return of brotherly love and Christian\r\nfellowship,\" he asked, \"so long as those who aspire to fill the high\r\nplaces of the church indulge in such wrath and bitterness? Now that the\r\ngreat conflict of the Civil War is past, and its issues settled,\r\nreligion and patriotism alike require the exercise of mutual\r\nforbearance, and the pursuit of those things which tend to peace.\"\r\n\r\nFor the mere game of party politics Mr. McCormick cared little or\r\nnothing. It was all as irksome to him as the task of governing Geneva\r\nwas to John Calvin; but he could not help himself. His political\r\nconvictions were bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. They were\r\nracial traits which his forefathers and foremothers had spent at least\r\nthree centuries in developing.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Dr. John Hall of New York, seeing how Mr. McCormick was\r\nworried by political obligations, said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you plague yourself with these uncongenial things? What glory\r\ncan you hope to get from politics that will add to what you now possess\r\nas the inventor of the Reaper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Hall,\" replied Mr. McCormick, \"I am in politics because I cannot\r\nhelp it. There are certain principles that I have got to stand by, and I\r\nam obliged to go into politics to defend them.\"\r\n\r\nThe form of Mr. McCormick's religious faith had been forged by such\r\npreacher-patriots as John Knox and Andrew Melville; and he, like them,\r\nfound it as imperative upon his conscience to fight for both civil and\r\nreligious liberty. With his whole heart he believed in American\r\ninstitutions as they had been established by the nation-builders of\r\n1776. He did not want the Constitution to be ignored by Federal\r\nreformers, nor the Union to be broken by secession. He was by\r\ntemperament and tradition a conservative, and opposed especially to all\r\nextreme measures and sectional innovations. As he had adapted his Reaper\r\nso that it would cut grain in all States, he could never see why\r\npolitical policies, too, should not be lifted above the limitations of\r\ngeography and made to conserve the welfare of the whole people. As he\r\nsaid on one strenuous occasion when laboring mightily to beat back the\r\nextremists in his own party: \"Is not every government on the face of the\r\nearth established upon the principle of compromise?\"\r\n\r\nTo special privileges of every sort he was unalterably opposed. He asked\r\nfor none for himself--no favoring tariff or grant of public land or\r\nmonopolistic franchise. \"I have been throughout my life,\" he said,\r\n\"opposed to all measures which tend to raise one class of the American\r\npeople upon the ruin of others, or one section of our common country at\r\nthe expense of another. The country is the common property of all\r\nparties, and all are interested in its prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nAll this shows the heroic side of McCormick; but he was not always\r\nheroic. He was a giant, but a most human and simple-natured giant.\r\nStrange as it may sound to those who knew him only with his armor on, it\r\nis true that he could be tender or humorous. There were tears and\r\nlaughter in him. There was no cruelty in his strength and no revenge in\r\nhis aggressiveness. He was a big, red-blooded, great-hearted man, who\r\nmight to-day be threatening to cane a politician who had deceived him,\r\nand to-morrow be playing with his younger children and letting their two\r\npet squirrels, Zip and Zoe, chase each other around his shoulders.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of power, not because of its privileges and exemptions, but\r\nbecause it furthered the work that he had in hand. He was often\r\nsurrounded by sycophants--by men who said yes to his yes and no to his\r\nno; and while he accepted this homage with a certain degree of\r\nsatisfaction, he was not deceived by it. On one occasion, when he was\r\nattending the Democratic Convention at Cincinnati--the convention that\r\nnominated Hancock as candidate for President,--he was beset by a court\r\nof flatterers and lip-servers. After it was over, he remarked simply to\r\nhis valet, \"Well, Charlie, there is a lot of farce and humbug about\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Francis L. Patton, who was for years the president of Princeton\r\nUniversity and also at one time editor of _The Interior_, was especially\r\nimpressed with this direct naturalness of McCormick. \"One meets with all\r\nsorts of men in the course of a lifetime,\" said Dr. Patton. \"There are\r\npatronizing men, pompous men, men who habitually wear a mask of\r\nseriousness, men who clothe themselves with dignity as with a coat of\r\nmail lest you should presume too much or go too far, men whose position\r\nis never defined, and double-minded men with whom you never feel\r\nyourself safe. But Mr. McCormick was not like one of these. There is\r\nthat in the possession of power which always tends to make men\r\nimperious. I do not mean to imply that he was altogether free from this\r\ntendency, for he was not. But he was approachable, companionable, and\r\nready to hear what I had to say. He was not one of those men who are so\r\nuninterestingly self-controlled as to be always the same. There were\r\ntimes when his mirth was contagious and times when his wrath was kindled\r\na little. We did not always agree, and sometimes we both grew hot in\r\nargument; but at the end his cheery laugh proclaimed the fact that our\r\ndifferences had only been the free and easy give-and-take of\r\nfriendship.\"\r\n\r\nTo see McCormick laugh was a spectacle. There was first a mellowing of\r\nhis usual Jovian manner. His gray-brown eyes twinkled. The tense lines\r\nof his face relaxed. Then came a smile and soon a burst of laughter,\r\nshaking his powerful body and putting the whole company for the time\r\ninto an uproar of merriment. It was the triumph of the genial and\r\nmagnetic side of his nature--the side that was ordinarily repressed by\r\nthe pressure of his big affairs.\r\n\r\nMcCormick had humor, but not wit. His jokes were simple and\r\nold-fashioned, such as Luther and Cromwell would have laughed at. There\r\nwas no innuendo and no cynicism. On one occasion two small urchins\r\nknocked at the door and asked for food. McCormick heard their voices\r\nand had them brought into the sitting-room, where he happened to be in\r\nconsultation with his lawyer. \"Now,\" said he to the youngsters, \"we are\r\ngoing to put both of you on trial. I will be the judge and this\r\ngentleman will be the prosecutor.\" Each boy in turn was placed on the\r\nwitness-stand, and plied with questions. It was soon clear that neither\r\nof them was telling the truth, so \"Judge\" McCormick took them in hand\r\nand gave them a serious talk on the folly and wickedness of lying. Then\r\nhe gave them twenty-five cents apiece, and sent them down to the kitchen\r\nto eat as much supper as they could hold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVESTING NEAR SPOKANE, WASHINGTON]\r\n\r\nAt another time a very dignified and self-centred military officer was\r\ntaking supper with the McCormick family. The first course, as usual, was\r\ncorn-meal mush and milk. This was served in Scotch fashion, with the hot\r\nmush in one bowl and the cold milk in another, and the practice was to\r\nso co-ordinate the eating of these that both were finished at the same\r\ntime. The officer planned his spoonfuls badly, and was soon out of\r\nmilk. \"Have some more milk to finish your mush, Colonel,\" said\r\nMcCormick. Several minutes later the Colonel's mush bowl was empty, at\r\nwhich McCormick said, \"Have some more mush to finish your milk.\" And so\r\nit went, with milk for the mush and mush for the milk, until the\r\nunfortunate Colonel was hopelessly incapacitated for the four or five\r\ncourses that came afterwards.\r\n\r\nMcCormick was not by any means a teller of stories, but he had a few\r\nsimple and well-worn anecdotes that appealed so strongly to his sense of\r\nhumor that he told and re-told them many times. There was the story of\r\nthe man who stole the pound of butter and hid it in his hat, and how the\r\ngrocer saw him and kept talking in the store, beside a hot stove, until\r\nthe butter melted and exposed the man's thievery. Another favorite story\r\nwas about the pig that found its way into a garden by walking through a\r\nhollow log, and how the gardener fooled the pig by placing the hollow\r\nlog in such a way that both ends of it were on the outside of the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nEven McCormick's jokes had a certain moral tang--a flavor of the first\r\nPsalm and the eighth chapter of Romans. They were apt to deal with the\r\ntroubles of the ungodly who had been caught in their wickedness. There\r\nwere times, too, when his sense of humor and his sense of justice would\r\nco-operate in odd ways. Once, when a roast game bird, which had been\r\nsent to him as a gift from the hunter, was left over from supper, he\r\nordered that his dainty be kept and served for the next day's luncheon.\r\nAt luncheon the next day it did not appear. On asking for the game bird,\r\na roast chicken was set before him, and he at once noticed that it was\r\nnot the same bird which he had ordered to be kept. He questioned the\r\nbutler, who protested that it was the same. After the meal McCormick\r\nordered that the servants involved should be called into the\r\ndining-room. From them, by a series of questions, he soon obtained the\r\ntruth and proved the butler to be the culprit. The one thing that he\r\nwould tolerate least was a lie. As he would say at times, \"A thief you\r\ncan watch, but I detest a liar.\"\r\n\r\nThere were very few who had the temerity to play a practical joke upon\r\nthe great inventor himself. His two youngest sons, Harold and Stanley,\r\nwould hide in the hallway when they saw him approaching, and pounce out\r\nupon him with wild yells in small-boy fashion, but they were both\r\nprivileged people.\r\n\r\nMcCormick was a most hearty and hospitable man. He was an ideal person\r\nfor such a life-work--the abolition of famine. He was fond of food and\r\nplenty of it. He loved to see a big table heaped with food. The idea of\r\nhunger was intolerable to him. He might well have been posing for a\r\nstatue of the deity of Plenty, as he squared himself around to the long,\r\nfamily dinner-table, with his napkin worn high and caught at his\r\nshoulders by a white silk band that went around his neck, and with a\r\ncomplacent, \"Now, then,\" plunged the carving-fork into a crisp and\r\nfragrant fowl that lay on the platter in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe fact that McCormick seldom made a social call was not due to his own\r\nchoosing, but because of the many worries and compulsions of his life.\r\nOnce, when confiding in an intimate friend, he said, \"It pains me very\r\nmuch to think how little I am known by my neighbors, but I seem to be\r\nalways too busy to meet them.\" He was not at all, as many have thought\r\nbecause of his strenuous life, a man of harsh and rough exterior. There\r\nwas nothing rough about him except his strength. He was irreproachable\r\nin dress and personal appearance. He did not drink, smoke, nor swear.\r\nAnd his manners and language, on formal occasions, were those of a\r\ndignified gentleman of the old school--a Calhoun, or a Van Buren.\r\n\r\nHe was not a hard-natured man, except when he was battling for his\r\nrights and his principles. He would often turn from an overwhelming mass\r\nof business to play with one of his children. He was as ready to forgive\r\nas he was to fight. He never cherished resentments or personal grudges.\r\nHe knew that life was a conflict of interests and policies; and when he\r\nforgave, his forgiveness was free and full, and not a formal ceremony.\r\nIt was as honest and as spontaneous as his wrath. He was one of the few\r\nmen who could freely pray, \"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive\r\nthose who trespass against us.\"\r\n\r\nHis fame and honors and intimacies with people of rank never made him\r\nless democratic in his sympathies. He always had a profound respect for\r\nthe man or woman who did useful work, if the work was done well. Once,\r\nwhen a poor woman went to him for advice about some trifling thing that\r\nshe had invented, he turned from his work and explained to her, with the\r\nutmost patience and courtesy, the things that she wished to know. With\r\nhis trusted employees, too, he was usually kindly and sometimes jovial.\r\n\"I had only one brush with him in thirty-five years,\" said one of his\r\ncashiers. \"The last time that I saw him, he met me on the street and\r\nsaid, 'Hello, Sellick, have you got lots of money? Can you give me a\r\nhundred thousand dollars to-day?' 'Yes, sir,' I answered. 'Well, I'm\r\nglad I don't need it,' he said with a laugh.\"\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of his workmen and his agents was always a source of pride\r\nto McCormick. It was one of the favorite topics of his conversation. He\r\nwould mention his men by name and tell of their exploits with the\r\ndeepest satisfaction. On one occasion, when a body of agents made a\r\nunited demand for higher salaries, there was one agent in Minnesota who\r\nrefused to take part in the movement. \"I don't want to force Mr.\r\nMcCormick,\" he said. \"I have worked for him for nearly thirty years, and\r\nI know that he is a just man, and that he will do what is right.\" Not\r\nlong afterwards, McCormick was told of this man's action, and he\r\nimmediately showed his appreciation by making the agent a present of a\r\ncarriage and fine team of horses.\r\n\r\nThere was one man who was wholly in McCormick's power--a negro named\r\nJoe, who, by the custom that prevailed in the South before the Civil\r\nWar, was a slave and the property of McCormick. They were of the same\r\nage, and had played together as boys. Joe grew up to be a tall,\r\nstraight, intelligent negro, and his master was very fond of him. He is\r\nmentioned frequently in McCormick's letters, usually in a considerate\r\nway. Years before the Civil War McCormick gave Joe his freedom, and some\r\nland and a good cabin. Now and then, even in the stress and strain of\r\nhis business-building, he would stop to write Joe a short letter of good\r\nwishes and advice. There was no other one thing, perhaps, which proved\r\nso convincingly the essential kindliness of his nature as his treatment\r\nof Joe.\r\n\r\nIn his family relations, too, McCormick was a man of tenderness and\r\ndevotion. When his father died, in 1846, he was struck down by sorrow.\r\n\"Many a sore cry have I had as I have gone around this place and found\r\nno father,\" he wrote to his brother William. And as soon as he was\r\nsolidly established in Chicago, his first act was to send for his\r\nmother, and to give her such a royal welcome that she could hardly\r\nbelieve her eyes. \"I feel like the Queen of Sheba,\" she said to her\r\nneighbors when she returned to Virginia; \"the half was never told.\"\r\n\r\nMcCormick helped his younger brothers--William and Leander, by making\r\nthem his partners. William died in 1865--a great and irreparable loss.\r\nHe was a man of careful mind and rare excellence of character,\r\nespecially able in matters of detail--a point in which Cyrus McCormick\r\nwas not proficient. The two men were well suited as partners. Cyrus\r\nplanned the work in large outlines, and broke down the obstacles that\r\nstood in the way; while William added the details and supervised the\r\ncarrying out of the plan. Leander, who also held a high place in the\r\nbusiness in its earlier days, withdrew from it later, and died in 1900.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRUS HALL McCORMICK, 1883\r\n\r\nHis Last Portrait]\r\n\r\nUntil 1858 McCormick had thought himself too busy to be married. But in\r\nthat year he met Miss Nettie Fowler, of New York, and changed his mind.\r\nIt was soon apparent that his marriage was not to be in any sense a\r\nhindrance to his success, but rather the wisest act of his life. Mrs.\r\nMcCormick was a woman of rare charm, and with a comprehension of\r\nbusiness affairs that was of the greatest possible value to her husband.\r\nShe was at all times in the closest touch with his purposes. By her\r\nadvice he introduced many economies at the factory, and rebuilt the\r\nworks after the Great Fire of 1871. The precision of her memory, and the\r\ngrasp of her mind upon the multifarious details of human nature and\r\nmanufacturing, made her an ideal wife for such a man as Cyrus H.\r\nMcCormick. As he grew older, he depended upon her judgment more and\r\nmore; and as Mrs. McCormick is still in the possession of health and\r\nstrength, it may truly be said that for more than half a century she has\r\nbeen a most influential factor in the industrial and philanthropic\r\ndevelopment of the United States.\r\n\r\nFour sons were born, and two daughters--Cyrus Hall, who is now President\r\nof the International Harvester Company; Robert, who died in infancy;\r\nHarold, Treasurer of the International Harvester Company; Stanley,\r\nComptroller of the Company; Virginia; and Anita, now known as Mrs.\r\nEmmons Blame.\r\n\r\nMr. McCormick was a most affectionate husband and father. He took the\r\nutmost delight in his home and its hospitalities; and invariably brought\r\nhis whole household with him whenever the growth of his business obliged\r\nhim to visit foreign countries. In the last few years of his life it\r\ngave him the most profound satisfaction to know that his oldest son\r\nwould pick up the McCormick burden and carry it forward. \"Cyrus is a\r\ngreat comfort to me,\" he said to an intimate friend. \"He has excellent\r\njudgment in business matters, and I find myself leaning on him more and\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there was a tender side to McCormick's strong nature,\r\nwhich was not seen by those who met him only upon ordinary occasions. He\r\nwas in reality a great dynamo of sentiment. He was deeply moved by\r\nmusic, especially by the playing of Ole Bull and the singing of Jenny\r\nLind, who were his favorites. He was as fond of flowers as a child. \"I\r\nlove best the old-fashioned pinks,\" he said, \"because they grew in my\r\nmother's garden in Virginia.\" Often the tears would come to his eyes at\r\nthe sight of mountains, for they reminded him of his Virginian home.\r\n\"Oh, Charlie,\" he said once to his valet, as he sat crippled in a\r\nwheel-chair in a Southern hotel, \"how I wish I could get on a horse and\r\nride on through those mountains once again!\"\r\n\r\nMcCormick was not in any sense a Gradgrind of commercialism--a man who\r\nenriched his coffers by the impoverishment of his soul. He made\r\nmoney--ten millions or more; but he did so incidentally, just as a man\r\nmakes muscle by doing hard work. Several of his fellow Chicagoans had\r\nswept past him in the million-making race. No matter how much money came\r\nto him, he was the same man, with the same friendships and the same\r\npurposes. And it is inconceivable that, for any amount of wealth, he\r\nwould have changed the ground-plan of his life.\r\n\r\nIt is strictly true to say that he was a practical idealist. He\r\nidealized the American Constitution, the Patent Office, the Courts, the\r\nDemocratic Party, and the Presbyterian Church. He was an Oliver Cromwell\r\nof industry. All his beliefs and acts sprang from a few simple\r\nprinciples and fitted together like a picture puzzle. There was religion\r\nin his business and business in his religion. He was made such as he was\r\nby the Religious Reformation of Europe and the Industrial Revolution of\r\nthe United States. He was all of one piece--sincere and\r\nself-consistent--a type of the nineteenth-century American at his best.\r\nHe was not sordid. He was not cynical. He was not scientific. He was a\r\nman of faith and works--one of the old-fashioned kind who laid the\r\nfoundations and built the walls of this republic.\r\n\r\nHe felt that he was born into the world with certain things to do. Some\r\nof these things were profitable and some of them were not, but he gave\r\nas much energy and attention to the one as to the other. In 1859, for\r\ninstance, he had a factory that was profitable, and a daily paper and a\r\ncollege that were expensive. He was struggling to extend his trade at\r\nhome and in Europe, to protect his patents, to prevent the war between\r\nthe North and South, and to maintain the simplicity of the Presbyterian\r\nfaith. To contend for these interests and principles was his life. He\r\ncould not have done anything else. It was as natural for him to do so as\r\nfor a fish to swim or a bird to fly. Once, towards the end of his life,\r\nwhen he was sitting in his great arm-chair, reflecting, he said to his\r\nwife, \"Nettie, life _is_ a battle.\" He made this announcement as though\r\nit were the discovery of a new fact. All his life he had been much less\r\nconscious of the battle itself than of the _cause_ for which he fought.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 McCormick died, at that time of the year when wheat is being\r\nsown in Spain and reaped in Mexico. The earth-life of \"the strong\r\npersonality before whom obstacles went down as swiftly and inevitably as\r\ngrain before the knife of his machines,\" was ended. His last words,\r\nspoken in a moment's awakening from the death-stupor, were--\"Work,\r\nwork!\" Not even the dissolution of his body could relax the fixity of\r\nhis will. And when he lay in state, in his Chicago home, there was a\r\nReaper, modelled in white flowers, at his feet; and upon his breast a\r\nsheaf of the ripe, yellow wheat, surmounted by a crown of lilies. These\r\nwere the emblems of the work that had been given him to do, and the\r\nevidence of its completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE REAPER AND THE NATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cyrus H. McCormick died in 1884 he had provided hunger-insurance\r\nfor the United States and the greater part of the civilized world. In\r\nthat year his own factory made 50,000 harvesting machines, and there\r\nwere in use, in all countries, more than 500,000 McCormick machines,\r\ndoing the work of 5,000,000 men in the harvest fields. The United States\r\nwas producing wheat at the rate of ten bushels per capita, instead of\r\nfour, as it had been in 1847, when McCormick built his first factory in\r\nChicago. And the total production of wheat in all lands was\r\n2,240,000,000 bushels--enough to give an abundance of food to\r\n325,000,000 people.\r\n\r\nChicago, in 1884, was a powerful city of six hundred thousand\r\npopulation. It had grown sixty-fold since McCormick rode into it by\r\nstage in 1845. It had 3,519 manufacturing establishments, giving work to\r\n80,000 men and women and producing commodities at the rate of\r\n$5,000,000 worth in a week. It was then what it is to-day--the chief\r\nReaper City and principal granary of the world. The wheat and flour that\r\nwere sent out from its ports and depots in the year that the inventor of\r\nthe Reaper died were enough to make ten thousand million loaves of\r\nbread, which, if they were fairly distributed, would have given about\r\nforty loaves apiece to the families of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe United States, in 1884, had been for six years the foremost of the\r\nwheat-producing nations. It had also grown to be first in mining,\r\nrailroads, telegraphs, steel, and agriculture. It was the land of the\r\nhighest wages and cheapest bread--an anomaly that foreign countries\r\ncould not understand. In the bulk of its manufacturing, it had forged\r\nahead of all other nations, even of Great Britain; and yet, although a\r\nvast army of men had been drawn from its farms to its factories, it had\r\nproduced in that year more than half a billion bushels of wheat--six\r\ntimes as much as its crop had been in the best year of the sickle and\r\nthe scythe.\r\n\r\nSo, in the span of his business life--from 1831 to 1884,--McCormick had\r\nseen his country rise from insignificance to greatness, and he had the\r\nsupreme satisfaction of knowing that his Reaper had done much, if not\r\nmost, to accelerate this marvellous progress. As we shall see, the\r\ninvention of the Reaper was the right starting-point for the up-building\r\nof a republic. It made all other progress possible, by removing the fear\r\nof famine and the drudgery of farm labor. It enabled even the laborer of\r\nthe harvest-field to be free and intelligent, because it gave him the\r\npower of ten men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WORKS OF THE McCORMICK HARVESTING MACHINE CO.]\r\n\r\nThe United States as a whole, had paid no attention to the Reaper until\r\nthe opening of the California gold mines in 1849. Then the sudden\r\nscarcity of laborers created a panic among the farmers, and boomed the\r\nsale of all manner of farm machinery. Two years later the triumph of the\r\nMcCormick Reaper at the London Exposition was a topic of the day and a\r\nsource of national pride. And in 1852 the Crimean War sent the price of\r\nwheat skywards, providing an English market for as much wheat as\r\nAmerican farmers could sell.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until the outbreak of the Civil War that the United\r\nStates learned to really appreciate the Reaper. By the time that\r\nPresident Lincoln had made his ninth call for soldiers, by the time that\r\nhe had taken every third man for the Northern armies, the value of the\r\nReaper was beyond dispute. By a strange coincidence, in this duel\r\nbetween wheat States on the one side, and cotton States on the other, it\r\nwas a Northerner, Eli Whitney, who had invented the cotton-gin, which\r\nmade slavery profitable; and it was a Southerner, Cyrus H. McCormick,\r\nwho had invented the Reaper, which made the Northern States wealthy and\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nIt was the Reaper-power of the North that off set the slave-power of the\r\nSouth. There were as many Reapers in the wheat-fields of 1861 as could\r\ndo the work of a million slaves. As the war went on, the crops in the\r\nNorthern States increased. Europe refused to believe such a miracle; but\r\nit was true. Fifty million bushels of American grain went to Europe in\r\n1861, and fifty-six million bushels in the following year. More than two\r\nhundred million bushels were exported during the four years of the war.\r\nThus the Reaper not only released men to fight for the preservation of\r\nthe Union. It not only fed them while they were in the field. It did\r\nmore. It saved us from bankruptcy as well as famine, and kept our credit\r\ngood among foreign nations at the most critical period in our history.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War came the settling of the West; and here again the\r\nReaper was indispensable. In most cases it went ahead of the railroad.\r\nThe first Reaper arrived in Chicago three years before the first\r\nlocomotive. \"We had a McCormick Reaper in 1856,\" said James Wilson; \"and\r\nat that time there was no railroad within seventy-five miles of our Iowa\r\nfarm. The Reaper worked a great revolution, enabling one man to do the\r\nwork that many men had been doing, and do it better. By means of it the\r\nWest became a thickly settled country, able to feed the nation and to\r\nspare bread and meat for the outside world.\"\r\n\r\nWhen McCormick was a boy, more wheat was raised in Virginia than in any\r\nother State. But by 1860 Illinois was ahead, and by degrees the sceptre\r\nof the wheat empire passed westwards, until to-day it is held by\r\nMinnesota. What with the Homestead Act of 1862, and the offer of\r\nMcCormick and the other Reaper manufacturers to sell machines to the\r\nfarmers on credit, it was possible for poor men, without capital, to\r\nbecome each the owner of 160 acres of land, and to harvest its grain\r\nwithout spending a penny in wages. Thus the immense area of the West\r\nbecame a populous country, with cities and railways and State\r\nGovernments, and producing one-tenth of the wheat of the world.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of these Western farmers brought in the present era of\r\nfarm machinery. It replaced \"the man with the hoe\" by the man with the\r\nself-binder and steel plow and steam thresher. It wiped out the old-time\r\ndrudge of the soil from American farms, and put in his stead the new\r\nfarmer, the _business_ farmer, who works for a good living and a profit,\r\nand not for a bare existence. Such men as Oliver Dalrymple, of North\r\nDakota, led the way by demonstrating what might be done by \"bonanza\r\nfarms.\" This doughty Scottish-American secured 30,000 acres of the Red\r\nRiver Valley in 1876, and put it all into wheat. It was such a\r\nwheat-field as never before had been seen in any country. The soil was\r\nturned with 150 gang plows, sown with 70 drills, and reaped with 150\r\nself-binders. Twelve threshing-machines, kept busy in the midst of this\r\nsea of yellow grain, beat out the straw and chaff and in the season\r\nfilled two freight trains a day with enough wheat in each train to give\r\ntwo thousand people their daily bread for a year.\r\n\r\nLed on by such pathfinders, American farmers launched out bravely, until\r\nnow they are using very nearly a billion dollars' worth of labor-saving\r\nmachinery. The whole level of farm life has been raised. It has been\r\nlifted from muscle to mind. The use of machinery has created leisure and\r\ncapital, and these two have begotten intelligence, education, science,\r\nso that the farmer of to-day lives in a new world, and is a wholly\r\ndifferent person from what he was when Cyrus McCormick learned to till\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThis elevation of the farmer is now seen to be our best guarantee of\r\nprosperity and national permanence. It was the incoming flood of wheat\r\nmoney that put the United States on its feet as a manufacturing nation.\r\nThe total amount of this money, from the building of the first McCormick\r\nReaper factory until to-day, is the unthinkable sum of $5,500,000,000,\r\nwhich may be taken as the net profit of the Reaper to the nation.\r\n\r\nThus the Reaper was not, like the wind-mill, for instance, a mere\r\nconvenience to the farmer himself. It was the link between the city and\r\nthe country. It directly benefited all bread-eaters, and put the whole\r\nnation upon a higher plane. It built up cities, and made them safe, for\r\nthe reason that they were not surrounded by hordes of sickle-and-flail\r\nserfs, who would sooner or later rise up in the throe of a\r\nhunger-revolution and pull down the cities and the palaces into\r\noblivion. When the first Reaper was sold, in 1840, only eight per cent\r\nof Americans lived in towns and cities; and to-day the proportion is\r\n_forty_ per cent. Yet bread is cheaper and more plentiful now than it\r\nwas then; and there is the most genial and good-natured co-operation\r\nbetween those who live among paved streets and those who live in the\r\nmidst of the green and yellow wheat-fields. There are no Goths and\r\nVandals on American farms.\r\n\r\nInstead of the tiny log workshop on the McCormick farm, in which the\r\nfirst crude Reaper was laboriously hammered and whittled into shape,\r\nthere is now a McCormick City in the heart of Chicago--the oldest and\r\nlargest harvester plant in the world. In sixty-two years of its life,\r\nthis plant has produced five or six millions of harvesting machines, and\r\nit is still pouring them out at the rate of 7,000 a week. If it were to\r\nship its yearly output at one time, it would require a railway caravan\r\nof 14,000 freight-cars to carry the machines from the factory to the\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McCORMICK REAPER IN USE IN RUSSIA]\r\n\r\nThis McCormick City is one of the industrial wonders that America\r\nexhibits to visiting foreigners, and it is so vast that it can only\r\nbe glanced at in a day. It covers 229 acres of land. In its buildings\r\nthere is enough flooring to cover a 90-acre farm, and if they were all\r\nmade over into one long building, twenty-five feet wide and one story\r\nhigh, it would be very nearly forty miles long, as far as from Chicago\r\nto Joliet. The population of McCormick City, counting workers only, is\r\n7,000, whose average wages are $2.20 a day.\r\n\r\nHere you will find a mammoth twine-mill--the largest of its kind in any\r\ncountry. Into this mill come the bright yellow sisal fibres from Yucatan\r\nand the manila fibres from the Philippines. These fibres are cleaned and\r\nstrewn upon endless chains of combs, which jerk and pull the fibres and\r\nfinally deliver them to spindles--1,680 spindles, which whirl and twist\r\n19,000 miles of twine in the course of a single day, almost enough to\r\nput a girdle around the earth. Most of this work is done by Polish girls\r\nand women, who are being displaced as farm laborers in their own country\r\nby American harvesting machines.\r\n\r\nThis plant is so vast that from one point of view it seems to be mainly\r\na foundry. Thousands of tons of iron--88,000 tons, to be exact,--pour\r\nout of its furnaces every year and are moulded into 113,000,000\r\ncastings. But from another point of view it appears to be a carpenter\r\nshop. In its yard stand as many piles of lumber as would build a\r\nfair-sized city--60,000,000 feet of it, cut in the forests of\r\nMississippi and Missouri. And so much of this lumber is being sawed,\r\nplaned, and shaped in the various wood-working shops that eight\r\nsawdust-fed furnaces are needed to supply them with power.\r\n\r\nThe marvels of labor-saving machinery are upon every hand, in this\r\nMcCormick City. The paint-tank has replaced the paint-brush. Instead of\r\npainting wheels by hand, for instance, ten of them are now strung on a\r\npole, like beads on a string, and soused into a bath from which they\r\ncome, one minute later, resplendent in suits of red or blue. The\r\nlabor-cost of painting these ten wheels is two cents. Guard-fingers, for\r\nwhich McCormick paid twenty-four cents apiece in 1845, are now produced\r\nwith a labor-cost of two cents a dozen. And as for bolts, with two\r\ncents you can pay for the making of a hundred. Both bolts and nuts are\r\nshaped by automatic machines which are so simple that a boy can operate\r\nfive at once, and so swift that other boys with wheelbarrows are kept\r\nbusy carrying away their finished product.\r\n\r\nThere is one specially designed machine, with a battery of augurs, which\r\nbores twenty-one holes at once, thus saving four-fifths of a cent per\r\nboard. Another special machine shapes poles and saves one cent per pole.\r\nSuch tiny economies appear absurd, until the immense output is taken\r\ninto account. Whoever can reduce the costs in the McCormick plant one\r\ncent per machine, adds thereby $3,500 a year to the profits, and helps\r\nto make it possible for a farmer to buy a magical self-binder, built up\r\nof 3,800 parts, for less than the price of a good horse, or for as much\r\nwheat as he can grow in one season on a dozen acres.\r\n\r\nThe vast McCormick City has its human side, too, in spite of all its\r\nnoise and semi-automatic machinery. Cyrus McCormick was not one of those\r\nemployers who call their men by numbers instead of names, and who have\r\nno more regard for flesh and blood than for iron and steel. He had\r\nworked with his hands himself, and brought up his sons to do the same.\r\nThe feeling of loyalty and friendliness between the McCormick family and\r\ntheir employees has from the first been unusually strong. In 1902, at\r\nthe suggestion of Stanley McCormick, gifts to the amount of $1,500,000\r\nwere made to the oldest employees of the business, as rewards for\r\nfaithful service and tokens of good-will. Also, a handsome club-house\r\nwas built for the comfort of the men of the McCormick City, and a\r\nrest-room for the women, under the mothering superintendence of a matron\r\nand trained nurse.\r\n\r\nBut this one McCormick City, immense as it is, does not by any means\r\nrepresent the sum total of McCormick's legacy to the United States. As\r\nthe founder of the harvesting-machine business, he deserves credit for\r\nan industry which now represents an investment of about $150,000,000.\r\nWith the sole exception of the Australian stripper, every wheat-reaping\r\nmachine is still made on the lines laid down by McCormick in 1831. New\r\nimprovements have been adopted; but not one of his seven factors has\r\nbeen thrown aside.\r\n\r\nFully two-thirds of this industry is still being done by the United\r\nStates, although four-fifths of the wheat is grown in other countries.\r\nOur national income, from this one item of harvesting machinery, has\r\nrisen to $30,000,000 a year--more than we derive from the exportation of\r\nany other American invention. No European country, apparently, has been\r\nable to master the complexities and multifarious details which abound in\r\na successful harvester business.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the efficiency of the larger American plants was greatly\r\nincreased by the organization of the International Harvester Company,\r\nwhich has its headquarters in Chicago. The McCormick City is the most\r\nextensive plant in this Company, and McCormick's son--who is also Cyrus\r\nH. McCormick--is its President. In this Company sixteen separate plants\r\nare coordinated, four of these being in foreign countries. Its yearly\r\noutput averages about $75,000,000 in value; and in bulk is great enough\r\nto fill 65,000 freight-cars. It has 25,000 workmen and 35,000 agents.\r\nThe lumber with which its yards are filled comes from its own\r\n80,000-acre forest; the steel comes from its own furnaces and the iron\r\nore from its own mines. It is so overwhelmingly vast, this new\r\nfamine-fighting consolidation, that the value of its output for one hour\r\nis greater than the $25,000 of capital with which McCormick built his\r\nfirst factory in Chicago.\r\n\r\nSo, it is evident that the McCormick Reaper has been an indispensable\r\nfactor in the making of America. Without it, we could never have had the\r\nAmerica of to-day. It has brought good, and nothing but good, to every\r\ncountry that has accepted it. It has never been, and never can be, put\r\nto an evil use. It cannot, under any system of government, benefit the\r\nfew and not the many. It is as democratic in its nature as the American\r\nConstitution; and in every foreign country where it cuts the grain, it\r\nis an educator as well as a machine, giving to the masses of less\r\nfortunate lands an object-lesson in democracy and the spirit of American\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE REAPER AND THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now see what the invention of the Reaper means to the human\r\nrace as a whole. We shall leave behind McCormick and the United States,\r\nand survey the field from a higher standpoint. The selection of wheat as\r\nthe first world-food,--its abundance made possible by the Reaper--its\r\ntransportation by railroads and steamships--its storage in\r\nelevators--the production of flour--the growth of wheat-banks,\r\nwheat-ports, and exchanges--the new wheat empires--the international\r\nmechanism of marketing--the conquest of famine and the stupendous\r\npossibilities of the future! These are the subjects that group\r\nthemselves under the general title--_The Reaper and the World_.\r\n\r\nTo find a world-food,--that was the beginning of the problem. All human\r\nbeings wake up hungry every morning of their lives; and consequently the\r\nfirst necessity of the day is food. The search for food is the oldest\r\nof instincts. It is the master-motive of evolution. It has reared\r\nempires up and thrown them down. As Buckle has shown, where the national\r\nfood is cheap and plentiful, population increases more rapidly. And as\r\nSir James Crichton-Browne, in a recent book on \"Parcimony in Nutrition,\"\r\nmaintains, the lack of food is a prolific cause of war, disease, and\r\nsocial misery in its various forms. \"Nothing is more demoralizing,\" he\r\nsays, \"than chronic hunger.\"\r\n\r\n\"For lack of bread the French Revolution failed,\" said Prince Krapotkin.\r\nFor lack of bread the opium traffic flourishes in India and China; the\r\nsecret of the prevalence of opium is that the natives use it to prevent\r\nhunger-pangs in time of famine. Once let those countries have cheap\r\nbread, and there may be no more opium sold there than there is to-day in\r\nKansas. For lack of bread came the war between Russia and Japan; what\r\nthe one nation wanted was a seaport for the grain of Siberia, and what\r\nthe other wanted was more land for the support of her swarming\r\npopulation. For lack of bread have come most of the crimes of greed and\r\nviolence,--most of the social systems based on sordid self-interest,\r\nmost of the ill-humor that has postponed the coming of an era of peace\r\non earth and good-will among men.\r\n\r\nNow, of the three main foods of the human race, flesh, rice, and wheat,\r\nwheat is the best suited to be a world-food. Flesh becomes too expensive\r\nonce the wild game of the forests is destroyed; and it is not suitable\r\nfor food in tropical countries. Rice, on the other hand, is not a\r\nflesh-forming food, and so is not suited for food in cold countries.\r\nWheat is the one food that is universal, as good for the Esquimaux as\r\nfor the South Sea Islander. It is not easily spoiled, as milk and fruits\r\nare; and it contains all the elements that are needed by the body and in\r\njust about the right proportion.\r\n\r\nWheat, to the botanist, is a grass--\"a degraded lily,\" to quote from\r\nGrant Allen. It was originally a flower that was tamed by man and\r\ntrained from beauty to usefulness. We do not know when or where the\r\nprehistoric Burbank lived who undertook this education of the\r\nwheat-lily. But we do know that wheat has been a food for at least five\r\nthousand years. We find it in the oldest tombs of Egypt and pictured on\r\nthe stones of the Pyramids. We know that Solomon sent wheat as a present\r\nto his friend, the King of Tyre; and we have reason to believe that its\r\nfirst appearance was in the valley of the Tigris and the Euphrates, near\r\nwhere the ancient city of Babylon rose to greatness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart Showing Relative Distribution of Values by\r\nProducing Countries in 1908 of World's Production of Five Principal\r\nGrains. Approximate Value, $9,280,000,000]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart Showing Relative Values in 1908 of World's\r\nProduction of the Five Principal Grains. Approximate Value,\r\n$9,280,000,000]\r\n\r\nWheat is not a wild weed. It is a tame and transient plant--a plant of\r\ncivilization. It could not continue to exist without man, and man,\r\nperhaps, could not exist except in the tropical countries without wheat.\r\nEach needs the other. If the human race were to perish from the face of\r\nthe earth, wheat might survive for three years, but no longer. So close\r\nhas this co-operation been between wheat and civilized man, that an\r\neminent German writer, Dr. Gerland, maintains with a wealth of evidence\r\nthat wheat was the original cause of civilization, partly because it was\r\nthe first good and plentiful food, and partly because it was wheat\r\nthat persuaded primitive man to forsake his wars and his wanderings\r\nand to learn the peaceful habits of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn any case, whatever its earlier history may have been, wheat is to-day\r\nthe chief food of the civilized races of mankind. It is the main support\r\nof 600,000,000 people. It has overcome its natural enemies--weeds,\r\nfungus diseases, insects, and drought,--and attained a crop total of\r\n3,500,000,000 bushels a year. To the intelligent, purposeful nations\r\nthat have become the masters of the human race, wheat is now the staff\r\nof life, the milk of Mother Earth, the essence of soil and air and rain\r\nand sunshine.\r\n\r\nBut, although wheat was known to be the best food for fifty centuries,\r\nit did not until very recently, until thirty or forty years ago, become\r\na world-food. Every community ate up its own wheat. It had little or\r\nnone to sell, because, no matter how much grain the farmers planted,\r\nthey could not in the eight or ten days of harvest gather more than a\r\ncertain limited quantity into their barns. All that one man could do,\r\nwith his wife to help him, was to snatch in enough wheat to feed ten\r\npeople for a year. Each family could do no more than feed one other\r\nfamily and itself. This was the Tragedy of the Wheat. There was never\r\nenough of it. It was so precious that none could be sure of it except\r\nthe kings and the nobilities. As for the masses of peasantry who sowed\r\nthe wheat and reaped it with hand-sickles, they would almost as soon\r\nhave thought of wearing diamonds as of eating white bread.\r\n\r\nThen, in 1831, came the Reaper. It was not invented in any of the older\r\ncountries, nor in any of the great cities of the world. For five\r\nthousand years neither the peasants nor the kings had conceived of any\r\nbetter way of reaping wheat than with the sickle and the scythe. The man\r\nwho had cut the Gordian knot of Famine was the son of a citizen-farmer,\r\nCyrus Hall McCormick by name, Scotch-Irish by race, American by birth,\r\nand inventor by heredity and early training.\r\n\r\nThis new machine, the Reaper, when it was full-grown into the\r\nself-binder, was equal to forty sickles. With one man to drive it, it\r\ncould cut and bind enough wheat in one season to feed four hundred\r\npeople. In its most highly developed form, the combined harvester and\r\nthresher, it has become so gigantic a machine that thirty-two horses are\r\nrequired to haul it. This leviathan cuts a fifty-foot roadway through\r\nthe grain, threshes it and bags it at the rate of one bag every\r\nhalf-minute. And the total world production of Reapers of every\r\nsort--self-binders, mowers, headers, corn-binders, etc.,--is probably as\r\nmany as 1,500,000 a year, two-thirds of them being made in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBecause of this harvesting machinery, the wheat crop of the world is now\r\nnearly twice what it was in 1879. The American crop has multiplied six\r\nand a half times in fifty years. Western Canada, Australia, Siberia, and\r\nArgentina have become wheat producers. The cost of growing one bushel in\r\nAmerica, with machinery and high wages, is now about half a dollar,\r\nwhich is less than the cost in Europe and as low as the cost in India,\r\nwhere laborers can be hired for a few pennies a day. With a sickle, the\r\ntime-cost of a bushel of wheat was three hours; with a self-binder, it\r\nis now ten minutes. And so, because of these amazing results, the rattle\r\nof the harvester has become an indispensable part of the music of our\r\nindustrial orchestra, harmonious with the click of the telegraph key,\r\nthe ring of the telephone bell, the hum of the sewing-machine, the roar\r\nof the Bessemer converter, the gong of the trolley, the whistle of the\r\nsteamboat, and the puff of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nNext to the Reaper, the most important factors in this world-mechanism\r\nof the bread, are the Railroad and the Steamboat. These arrived on the\r\nscene just at the right time to distribute the surplus that the Reaper\r\nproduced. The Steamboat, and its humble relative, the barge, came first.\r\nThe Erie Canal of 1825, the Suez Canal of 1869, and the Sault Ste. Marie\r\nCanal of 1881, were built largely for the carrying of the wheat. By 1856\r\nwheat was on its way from Chicago to Europe; and four years later the\r\nfirst wheat-ship curved around Cape Horn from California. Ten years ago\r\nan entirely new kind of ship, a sort of immense steel bag called a\r\n\"whaleback,\" was built to carry 250,000 bushels of wheat in a single\r\nload. By this means a ton of wheat is actually carried thirteen miles\r\nfor one cent. There are to-day small barges on the canals of Holland,\r\nlarge ones on the river Volga, and several thousand steamships on the\r\nworld's main water-ways, all carrying burdens of wheat. Enough is now\r\nbeing transported from port to port to give steady work to fully three\r\nhundred steamships and summer work to very nearly as many more.\r\n\r\nThere was an exciting contest between the ship and the car in the\r\nearlier days of transportation, to see which should carry the largest\r\nshare of the wheat. About 1869 the car won. In this year, too, the\r\nUnited States was belted with a railway, east to west, which meant the\r\nopening up of the first great wheat-empire. Other railways pushed out\r\ninto the vast prairies of the West, lured by the call of the wheat. They\r\nwere the pioneers of the world's wheat-railways. Wheat was their chief\r\nfreight and wheat farmers were their chief passengers. At the outset the\r\ngrain was shipped in bags. Then some railway genius invented the\r\ngrain-car, which holds as much as twenty or twenty-five wagons. And\r\nto-day one of the ordinary moving pictures of an American railroad is a\r\nsixty-car train travelling eastward with enough wheat in its rolling\r\nbins to give bread to a city of ten thousand people for a year.\r\n\r\nThe trans-Siberian railway, which is the longest straight line of steel\r\nin the world, was built largely as a wheat-conveyor. So were the\r\nrailways of western Canada, Argentina, and India. Ever since the advent\r\nof the Reaper wheat has been the prolific mother of railways and\r\nsteamships. While the rice nations are still putting their burdens on\r\nox-carts and on the backs of camels and elephants, the wheat nations\r\nhave built up a system of transportation that is a daily miracle of\r\ncheapness, efficiency, and speed. This system is not yet finished. A new\r\nline of steamships is about to be set afloat between Buenos Ayres and\r\nHamburg. The Erie Canal is being re-made, at a fabulous cost, so that a\r\nsteamer with 100,000 bushels of wheat can go directly from Buffalo to\r\nNew York. And an adventurous railway is now pushing its way north from\r\nthe wheat-fields of western Canada to the unknown water of Hudson Bay,\r\nwhence the wheat will be carried by boat to London and Liverpool.\r\n\r\nTo-day it is not the long haul of wheat, but the short haul, that is\r\nmore expensive. It is cheaper to carry wheat from one country to another\r\nthan from the barn to the nearest town. The average distance that an\r\nAmerican farmer has to haul his grain is nine and a half miles, and the\r\naverage cost of haulage is nine cents per hundred pounds. Thus it has\r\nactually become true that to carry wheat ten miles by wagon costs more\r\nthan 2,300 miles by steamship. Such is the tense efficiency of our\r\nwheat-carrier system that a bushel of grain can now be picked up in\r\nMissouri and sent to the cotton-spinners of England for a dime.\r\n\r\nAssociated with this transportation problem was the matter of storage.\r\nThere was no sort of a building known to man, fifty years ago, in which\r\na million bushels of wheat might be conveniently kept. An entirely new\r\nkind of building had to be invented. All the wheat barns were\r\noverflowing. All the warehouses were outgrown. The difficulty was to\r\nmake a huge building that could be quickly filled and emptied. Then, at\r\nthe precise moment when he was needed, an inventor, F. H. Peavey,\r\nappeared with a device for elevating grain--an endless carrier to which\r\nmetal cups were fastened. From this idea the _elevator_ was born.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAMMOTH WHEAT-FIELD IN SOUTH DAKOTA WITH TWENTY\r\nHARVESTERS IN LINE]\r\n\r\nThe first city that appreciated the usefulness of this new, unlovely\r\nbuilding was Chicago. It became not only the home of the Reaper, but\r\nalso the main storehouse of the wheat. It erected one after another of\r\nthese mastodonic buildings until to-day thirty-six of them stand along\r\nthe water-front, roomy enough to hold the entire crop of Holland,\r\nSweden, Greece, Egypt, Mexico, and New Zealand. What these immense\r\ngrain-bins have done for the prosperity of Chicago would require many\r\nbooks to tell completely. It was largely because of them that Chicago\r\noutgrew Berlin and became the central metropolis of North America, with\r\ntwenty-six railways emptying their freight at her doors and seven\r\nthousand vessels a year arriving at her harbor.\r\n\r\nAt present Chicago has swung from wheat to corn and oats, and enabled\r\nMinneapolis to become the greatest actual wheat-storage city of the\r\nworld. In Minneapolis the owning of elevators has become a profession.\r\nThere are not only forty-four elevators in the city itself, but also\r\nforty elevator companies that have built more than two thousand\r\nelevators in the wheat States of the Northwest. The Jumbo of all\r\nelevators is here--a stupendous granary that holds 6,000,000 bushels, as\r\nmuch as may be reaped by two thousand self-binders from seven hundred\r\nsquare miles of land.\r\n\r\nOf all American cities, there are only five others that can put roofs\r\nover 10,000,000 bushels of grain. Duluth-Superior stands at the head of\r\nthese, with twice the storage capacity of New York. This double city,\r\nwith the picturesque location, Duluth on her Minnesota hillside and\r\nSuperior on her Wisconsin plain, has in recent years overtaken all\r\ncompetitors and is now the leading wheat-shipping port in the world.\r\nBuffalo comes next as an elevator city, having twenty-eight towering\r\nbuildings of steel operated by the energy of Niagara Falls. Even this\r\nfamous cataract helps a little in the making of cheap bread. New York\r\nfollows closely after Buffalo; with Kansas City and St. Louis running\r\nneck and neck at quite a distance behind. It is an odd fact that there\r\nis not one elevator on the Pacific coast. Because of the rainless\r\nweather, the wheat is put into bags and piled outdoors until the day of\r\nshipment. This is an expensive method of handling, as the bags cost four\r\ncents apiece and no machine has as yet been invented that will pick up\r\nand handle a sack of grain.\r\n\r\nThe American elevator has now been very generally adopted as the ideal\r\nwheat-bin. Two Roumanian cities, Braila and Galatz, have suggested an\r\nimprovement by using concrete instead of steel. And one Russian city,\r\nNovorossisk, on the Black Sea, has introduced a most original feature in\r\nthe building of elevators by erecting a very large one a quarter of a\r\nmile back from the dock, because of the better view that this site\r\naffords of the harbor.\r\n\r\nLondon has no elevators, and never has had, although it buys more wheat\r\nthan any other city. It has six million mouths to feed, so that the\r\ngrain is devoured as fast as it arrives. To give bread to London would\r\ntake the entire crop of Indiana or Siberia. Neither are there any\r\nelevators of any importance in Paris, Berlin, or Antwerp. Whatever wheat\r\narrives at these cities is either hurried to the mill or re-shipped.\r\nWheat is too precious in Europe to be stored for a year or for two\r\nyears, as may happen in Minnesota. Rotterdam has one elevator only and\r\nof moderate size. Neither Odessa nor Sulina have any of the large\r\nproportions, for the reasons that in Odessa the labor unions have an\r\nunconquerable prejudice against elevators, and in Sulina the grain is\r\nheld only a short time and then forwarded elsewhere. This Sulina, as a\r\nglance at the map of Europe will show, is the loneliest of all the\r\nwheat-cities. It stands on a heap of gravel at the mouth of the\r\nDanube--an oasis of human life in a vast marshy wilderness. The\r\nchildren born there have never seen a railway; but 1,400 ships leave the\r\nstone docks of Sulina every year laden with enough wheat to feed London,\r\nParis, and Berlin. To find the exact reverse of Sulina, we must go to\r\nBuenos Ayres--the premier wheat-city of South America and the gayest of\r\nthem all. Built up at first by the cattle trade, and now depending\r\nmainly upon wheat, this superb city has become the topmost pinnacle of\r\nSouth American luxury and refinement. It has several new elevators,\r\nerected by the railway companies.\r\n\r\nAfter the Reaper, the Railway, the Steamship, and the Elevator, came the\r\nExchange. This, too, came first in Chicago, in its modern form. There\r\nwas one little grain Exchange in the Italian city of Genoa, several\r\ncenturies ago, and England points back to 1747 as the year when her\r\nfirst Corn Exchange was born. But it was the Exchange in Chicago,\r\nstarted by thirteen men in 1848, that first came into its full growth\r\nand became an arena of international forces.\r\n\r\nA wheat Exchange is to-day much more than a meeting-place for brokers.\r\nIt is a mechanism. It is a news bureau--a parliament--a part of the\r\nwhispering-gallery of the world. It not only provides a market where\r\nwheat can at once be bought and sold, but it obtains for both buyer and\r\nseller all the news from everywhere about the wheat, so that no bargain\r\nmay be made in the dark. Before Exchanges were organized there were\r\ntimes when a farmer would drive twenty miles to the nearest town with a\r\nload of wheat, and find no one to buy it. Even in Chicago, in the early\r\nforties, a farmer ran the risk of not being able to trade his wheat for\r\na few groceries.\r\n\r\nAt present, when a buyer or a seller of wheat arrives at an Exchange, he\r\ngoes at once to consult the weather map of the day. From here he passes\r\nto a series of bulletin-boards, which inform him of the arrival or outgo\r\nof wheat at many cities. One board tells him the visible supply of wheat\r\nin the world, so that he can easily ascertain, if he wishes to do so,\r\n_how much bread the human race ate last week_. Other boards have\r\ntelegrams and cablegrams of disaster--frost in Alberta, hail in\r\nMinnesota, green bug in Texas, rust in Argentina, drought in Australia,\r\nlocusts in Siberia, monsoon in India, and chinch bug in Missouri. Good\r\nnews is here, too, as well as bad. There may be reports of a\r\nrecord-breaking crop in Roumania, an opulent rain in Kansas, a new\r\nsteamship line from Kurrachee to Liverpool, and the plowing of a million\r\nacres of new land in western Canada. And also there are, of course, the\r\nrecords of the latest sales and prices in other Exchanges.\r\n\r\nThus the farmer can not only find a ready buyer for his wheat. He can,\r\nby means of a newspaper or a telephone, know what price he ought to\r\nreceive, as all the news gathered by the Exchanges is freely given to\r\nthe public. Such is the perfection of the news mechanism that has been\r\nbuilt up around the marketing of the wheat, that before a Dakota farmer\r\nstarts out for town with a load of grain, he can go to the telephone\r\nunder his own roof and learn the prices at various cities and the\r\nworld-conditions of the wheat trade.\r\n\r\nThe paper which best deserves to be called the official journal of the\r\nwheat is the _Corn Trade News_, of Liverpool; and the building which\r\nbest deserves to be called the international headquarters of the wheat\r\nbusiness is the handsome new Baltic Exchange, near by the Bank of\r\nEngland in London. This Baltic market is so practically international,\r\nin fact, that it is never closed. Whoever wishes to buy or sell wheat\r\nmay do so here at any hour of the day or night. There are no days in\r\nthis building and no seasons, for the reason that it is always noonday\r\nand harvest-time in some part of the world. In this Baltic Exchange,\r\ntoo, there is now a nucleus for a Wheat Parliament, organized under the\r\nname of the Corn Trade Association. This society has undertaken to put\r\nthe wheat business in order, by establishing standard contracts,\r\ncollecting samples of all wheats, arbitrating disputes, and condemning\r\nall dishonesties of whatever sort.\r\n\r\nAs wheat Exchange cities, London, Liverpool, and Chicago outclass all\r\nothers. Neither Italy nor France have any central or dominating market.\r\nIn Paris, Antwerp, Hamburg, and Amsterdam the Bourses, as the Exchanges\r\nare called, are public buildings, and the members of each Bourse\r\nrepresent the local situation and nothing more. One of the most\r\nambitious and speculative of the European Exchanges is the one at\r\nBudapest, which stands beside a dainty little park where the brokers eat\r\ntheir lunch in fine weather; and the youngest of all Exchanges is the\r\none that was born in Buenos Ayres in 1908, representing a surplus of a\r\nhundred million bushels a year.\r\n\r\nBesides the brokers, in their Exchanges, there must also be inspectors\r\nin the marketing of the wheat. In some countries these inspectors are\r\ngovernment officers, as in Germany and Canada; and elsewhere they are\r\nlocal officials or private employees, as in the United States. A carload\r\nof wheat, passing from Dakota to New York, will probably have from three\r\nto six inspections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVESTING IN ROUMANIA]\r\n\r\nAlso, the insurance agent takes his place in the circle of\r\nco-operation when the wheat begins to move from barn to bakery. He\r\ninsures the wheat in the elevators, on the cars, or in the steamships.\r\nHe may even insure it against hail and tornadoes while it is growing. It\r\nis so precious, this brown seed, that we watch over every step of its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt is the bankers' busy season, too, when the wheat begins to move. The\r\nmarketing of the grain ties up more money than any other yearly event.\r\n\"It threatens us with disaster every fall,\" said one of the Secretaries\r\nof the Treasury, when making a plea for a more elastic currency. \"We\r\nship half a million dollars a day during harvest,\" said the president of\r\na Chicago bank. \"We drew more than five millions of currency from the\r\nEast and sent thirty-eight millions to the country during September and\r\nOctober of last year,\" said a third financier, who spoke for Chicago as\r\na whole. In short, the movement of the wheat means a matter of five\r\nhundred millions to American bankers; and it is the most important\r\noccurrence of the year to the bankers of Russia, Canada, Argentina, and\r\nAustralia. Many a bank, as well as many a railroad, was founded upon\r\nthe moving of the wheat.\r\n\r\nThe broker, the banker, the inspector, and the insurance agent--these\r\nfour render a useful service to the wheat that has left home; but there\r\nis a fifth man about whose usefulness there is the widest possible\r\ndifference of opinion--the speculator. From one point of view, the\r\nspeculator is the driving-wheel of the whole wheat trade. By his energy\r\nand his impetus he steadies and equalizes the conflicting forces, and\r\ngives the entire mechanism a continuous movement. From another point of\r\nview, he is a gambler, reckless and parasitical, who interferes with the\r\nnatural laws of supply and demand, and snatches an unearned toll from\r\nthe wheat bins of the world.\r\n\r\nSome of the wheat nations not only permit speculation in wheat, but\r\npractically encourage it by allowing more privileges to the speculator\r\nthan to the ordinary business man. Others are resolutely stamping it\r\nout, as a nuisance and a crime. The nations that have voted \"Yea\" on\r\nspeculation are Great Britain, Hungary, Sweden, Norway, France, and the\r\nUnited States; and the nations that have voted \"Nay\" are Germany,\r\nHolland, Belgium, Australia, Switzerland, Greece, and Argentina. Canada\r\nhas been divided on the question, since the Province of Manitoba broke\r\nup the Winnipeg Grain Exchange by legislation in 1908.\r\n\r\nIn the end, as organization increases, speculation will decline. Chicago\r\nwill try to push prices up and London will try to pull them down; but\r\nthere will be fewer violent fluctuations. Better methods of farming and\r\na more reliable system of news-gathering will eliminate the element of\r\nchance to such an extent that the wheat trade will offer less and less\r\nscope for speculation and no inducements at all to the reckless plunger.\r\nAlready the frantic methods of marketing wheat have been outgrown in the\r\nExchanges of Liverpool and London. In neither of these places is there\r\nany Wheat Pit, or any maelstrom of frenzied brokers. Without any\r\nshouting or jostling or wild tumult of any kind, the English brokers are\r\nbuying two hundred million bushels of wheat a year, and controlling the\r\nsituation to a greater extent than any other body of men. This, too,\r\nwithout any restrictive legislation.\r\n\r\nBefore wheat was made plentiful by the Reaper, it was possible for a\r\ndaring man to establish a corner or monopoly; but no one has succeeded\r\nin doing this for more than forty years. The last wheat corner that did\r\nnot fail was in 1867. Since then every would-be cornerer has been caught\r\nin his own trap. The wheat-machinery of the world has now become so vast\r\nthat no individual can master it. Whoever has tried it has found that he\r\nwas being cornered by the wheat; for as soon as he had raised the price\r\nto an artificial level, the grain has flowed in upon him and covered him\r\nup. The price of wheat to-day may be temporarily deflected by schemes\r\nand conspiracies, but not for long. Ultimately it is decided by the\r\nstate of the crop and the state of public opinion in the thirty-six\r\ncountries that grow wheat and eat bread.\r\n\r\nWithin the last thirty years, since the Reaper has come into universal\r\nuse, the area of the world's wheat-field has doubled. New countries\r\nhave arisen, that were only waste places before. The habitable earth has\r\ngrown immensely larger. There is more room for both wheat and men to\r\ngrow, and less scope for the forestaller and the monopolist. Just as the\r\nReaper was the advance-machine of civilization across the prairies of\r\nthe West, so it is to-day opening up new territories and developing new\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nNorthwestern Canada, for instance, was a dozen years ago supposed to be\r\na barren wilderness of snow and ice, in which none but the hunter and\r\nthe fur-trader might earn a living. Then several adventurous Minnesotans\r\nwent across and planted wheat. It grew--forty bushels to the acre, and\r\nthe acres, there were two hundred million of them, were waiting for the\r\nplow and almost to be had for the asking. Since then, more than three\r\nhundred thousand American farmers have swept across the line and joined\r\nin the greatest wheat-rush of this generation. Twelve hundred grain\r\nelevators have been built along the line of the Canadian Pacific; and\r\nChicago self-binders rattled through the yellow wheat last Summer two\r\nthousand miles north of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nIn Argentina, too, and Australia, where the wheat ripens just in time to\r\ndecorate the Christmas trees, there is to be seen the same conquest of\r\nnature. Desolate plains are being tamed by the plow and exploited by the\r\nharvesters. In the semi-arid belt that lies east of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nnew kinds of wheat, less thirsty, are being taught to grow. In Russia\r\nand Siberia a vast tract of twenty-five million acres has been rescued\r\nfrom idleness in the last fifteen years. And even in the valley of the\r\nEuphrates, where wheat, so it is believed, was born, a new railway is\r\nnow being constructed which, when it is finished, will carry oil and\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nBy thus opening up new regions to settlement, the wheat-farmer not only\r\nthwarts the monopolist and makes the world a larger place to live in, he\r\ndoes more: he compels the gold to come out of its vaults in the great\r\ncities and to flow to the outermost parts of the earth. For every\r\neighteen thousand pounds of wheat that go to the city, there will go\r\nback to the farmer one pound of gold. For every loaf of bread upon a\r\nLondoner's table, there will go a cent and a half to the man behind the\r\nReaper. And so, the sale of every wheat-crop means that the gold will\r\ncome throbbing out into the arteries of business, like the blood from\r\nthe heart, and on its way back and forth nourish the whole body of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIt is in the very nature of the wheat trade to benefit the masses and\r\nnot the few. The more wheat that grows, the less danger there is of an\r\naristocracy of wheat. More wheat means more luxury in the farm-house,\r\nmore traffic on the railway, and more food in the slums. It means busier\r\nfactories and steel-mills, because the farmer, when he receives his\r\nwheat-money, becomes the customer of the manufacturer. Thus it was not\r\nat all accidental that the wealth of Buenos Ayres came with the\r\nexportation of wheat, or that the commercial awakening of Canada\r\nfollowed the opening up of her western prairies, or that the industrial\r\nsupremacy of the United States dates from the immense wheat harvests\r\nthat began in 1880 to push the whole country forward with the power of\r\n$500,000,000 a year. As one of McCormick's competitors, J. D. Easter of\r\nEvanston, once declared, \"It seems as though the McCormick Reaper\r\nstarted the ball of prosperity rolling, and it has been rolling ever\r\nsince.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVESTING HEAVY GRAIN, SOUTH AMERICA]\r\n\r\nIf we wish to know what the Reaper will eventually do for these new\r\nwheat countries, we have but to glance back over the short history of\r\nour ten prairie States. Here, by the use of both science and machinery,\r\nthe New Farmer has reached his highest level of success. By 1884 these\r\nten States had twenty million thriving settlers, riding on forty-two\r\nthousand miles of railway, raising as much wheat in a day as New England\r\ncould in a year, and storing their profits in twenty-five hundred banks.\r\nIncredible as it may seem to Europe and Asia, it is true that even the\r\npoorhouses in Iowa and Kansas were used last year as storehouses for\r\nwheat. And it is true that in the co-operative commonwealth called\r\nKansas, at the last assessment, there were found to be forty-four\r\nthousand pianos and six million dollars' worth of carriages and\r\nautomobiles. This in a State where there are no Grand Dukes and where\r\nevery man works for a living!\r\n\r\nIf the lords of Siberia wish to know what may be done with that\r\nfamine-swept vastitude they may come and see that bed of an ancient sea,\r\nwhich in thirty years has been transformed into the world's greatest\r\nbread-land--the Red River Valley. Here the banks are not only packed\r\nwith millions, but hundreds of millions, belonging to the shirt-sleeved\r\nproprietors of the soil. Here, in the yellow days of August, a man may\r\ntravel for days and see no limit to the ocean of waving, shimmering\r\nwheat, that ripples around him in a vast sky-bounded circle.\r\nWheat--wheat--wheat! Nothing but wheat! It is a Field of the Cloth of\r\nGold, that adds nothing to the glory of kings, but much to the glory of\r\nthe common people. Drop the German Empire down upon this valley and its\r\nexpanse of dizzying, swirling wheat, and the wheat would not be wholly\r\neclipsed. There would still be enough grain around the edges to make a\r\ngolden fringe.\r\n\r\nThe children born and bred in this Red River Valley have never seen,\r\nexcept in pictures, a sickle or a flail. Their only conception of a\r\nharvest time is that a battery of red self-binders, with reels whirling\r\nand knives clacking, shall charge upon the wheat as though each acre\r\nwere a battalion of hostile infantry, and make war until the land is\r\nstrewn with heaps of fallen sheaves. Famine, to these children of the\r\nwheat, seems as remote a danger as the cooling of the sun. Even the one\r\nyoung State of North Dakota, not yet of age, is now growing food for\r\nherself, and for twelve million people besides.\r\n\r\nSo, the urgent world-problem is to teach other nations the lesson of the\r\nRed River Valley. There is not yet enough bread so that we may put a\r\nloaf at every plate. To feed the whole race according to the present\r\nAmerican standard of living would require ten thousand million\r\nbushels--three times as much as we are raising now; and the demand is\r\nfast outgrowing the supply. Sooner or later the Chinese will learn to\r\neat at least one loaf a week apiece, and when they do, it will mean\r\nthat the world's wheat crop must be increased ten per cent.\r\n\r\nMore wheat and a more efficient organization of wheat agencies--that is\r\nthe programme of the future. Already one unsuccessful effort has been\r\nmade to hold an international Wheat Congress; and the second attempt may\r\nend more happily. Now that the world has become so small that a\r\ncablegram flashes completely around it in twelve minutes; now that there\r\nare forty-four nations united by The Hague Conferences and fifty-eight\r\nby the Postal Union; now that war has grown to be so expensive that one\r\ncannon-shot costs as much as a college education and one battleship as\r\nmuch as a first-class University,--it is quite probable that the march\r\nof co-operation will continue until there is a Congress, and a central\r\nheadquarters and a Tribunal, which will represent nothing less than an\r\ninternational fellowship of the wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nGIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now seen the machinery by which the wheat is cut, moved, stored,\r\nfinanced, and marketed. Its next and last step, as wheat, is to the\r\nFlour-mill, whence it goes to the bakeries, the groceries, and the homes\r\nof six hundred million people. Here, too, there have had to come new\r\nmethods since the advent of the Reaper.\r\n\r\nIn the Dark Ages of the sickle and the flail, two flat stones did well\r\nenough for a flour-mill. Even the bread that was found in the ruins of\r\nPompeii had been made of wheat that was merely crushed. Later came the\r\nmill run by horse-power or by the energy of a little stream. Such were\r\nthe first American mills. The mill that was operated by George\r\nWashington at Mount Vernon, for instance, was run by water-power and\r\nproduced flour that sold for thirteen dollars a barrel. Rochester, N.\r\nY., was the first American \"Flour City\"; but the modern flour-mill did\r\nnot come until it was compelled to come by the deluge of Reaper wheat\r\nthat flooded the markets in 1870.\r\n\r\nAs usually happens in the case of inventions, it came where it was not\r\nexpected. It made its arrival in the Hungarian city of Budapest in 1874.\r\nThe \"new process,\" as it was called, was based upon the use of steel\r\nrolls instead of stones. It was as superior to the old-fashioned way as\r\nthe Reaper had been to the sickle or as the thresher was to the flail.\r\nIt was amazingly quick and produced a better flour. By reason of these\r\nnew mills, Budapest became at a bound the foremost \"Flour City\" of the\r\nworld, and held its place against all comers until 1890.\r\n\r\nThen the prestige passed to Minneapolis--a young city on the head-waters\r\nof the Mississippi, the recent home of the prairie-dog and the buffalo.\r\nShortly before the Civil War, a youthful lawyer named William D.\r\nWashburn drifted westwards from Maine until he came to Minneapolis, at\r\nthat time a tiny village on the frontier. He found no clients here, and\r\nno law; but he did find a ledge of limestone rock jutting across the\r\nMississippi and making the only large water-fall in all that region. So\r\nhe threw aside his legal education and became the organizer of a\r\nwater-power company and the owner of a little flour-mill. Soon the long\r\nline of Reapers reached Minneapolis and swept on westwards into the\r\nrichest wheat lands that had ever been known. The wheat overwhelmed\r\nthe slow old-fashioned mills, so the ex-lawyer in 1878 adopted the\r\nBudapest system and built a roller-mill that was the quickest and\r\nmost automatic of its kind. Other millers had by this time come to\r\nMinneapolis--Pillsbury, Crosby, Christian, and Dunwoody; and all\r\ntogether they pushed the flour business until in twelve years they had\r\nbecome the main millers of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIANS REAPING THEIR HARVEST, WHITE EARTH, MINNESOTA]\r\n\r\nTo-day the river of wheat is deepest at Minneapolis. Its twenty-two\r\ngreat mills roll 120,000,000 bushels into flour as an ordinary year's\r\nwork. While the swiftest mill in Athens, in the age of Pericles,\r\nproduced no more than two barrels a day, there is one mill of incredible\r\nsize in Minneapolis that fills _seventeen thousand_ barrels in a\r\ntwenty-four hours' run--enough to give bread to New York State and\r\nCalifornia. What the Greeks did in a day the Minnesotans do in ten\r\nseconds. Five million barrels of this Minneapolis flour is each year\r\nscattered among foreign nations, a fact which informs us that flour is\r\nnow not a local product, but part of the real currency of nations. No\r\ndoubt the people who dwell by the Sea of Galilee, whose fathers were\r\nonce miraculously fed upon seven loaves of bread and a few fishes, are\r\nnow being fed miraculously upon loaves of bread made from the flour of\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\nThe making of the bread--that is the final step in this movement of the\r\nwheat. As yet, this is a local process, though not wholly so. Certain\r\nready-to-eat foods are now being made from wheat and boxed in such a way\r\nthat they may be sent from one country to another. If we trace back the\r\noriginal of a loaf of bread of ordinary size, we shall find that it was\r\nmade from two-thirds of a pound of flour, which was rolled from one\r\npound of wheat, containing about twelve thousand grains that were grown\r\non forty-eight square feet of land and reaped by a self-binder in two\r\nseconds. When the wheat was cut in the old-fashioned way, with a\r\nhand-sickle, every loaf of bread required eighty seconds' labor instead\r\nof two.\r\n\r\nIn a public test made last year in the State of Washington, wheat was\r\ncut, threshed, ground into flour, and baked into biscuits in\r\ntwenty-three minutes. This is an evidence that all the machinery for\r\nhandling grain has now been brought up to the same high level of speed\r\nand efficiency as the self-binder. It also helps us to understand the\r\ndaily marvel of cheap bread--the fact that a hundred loaves of bread are\r\nnow delivered one by one at an American workingman's door for the cost\r\nof a seat at the opera or a couple of song-records by Caruso.\r\n\r\nSo plentiful is this bread that the loaves baked from American flour in\r\n1907 would have made a wall of bread around the earth, or have given\r\nthirty loaves apiece to every human creature; and so cheap has it become\r\nin these latter days that even in the United States it is not more than\r\nthree cents a day per capita. The unskilled laborer who receives $1.50 a\r\nday, earns his bread in the first ten minutes, every work day morning.\r\nAnd the total tax he pays to the men who make the self-binders is not\r\nmore than one tenth of a cent per loaf.\r\n\r\nThree-sevenths of the people of the world are now on a wheat basis. They\r\nare the lesser fraction in point of numbers, but the larger in point of\r\nprosperity and progress. A wheat map of the globe would be very nearly a\r\nmap of modern civilization. As yet, there are many peasants who grow\r\nwheat and cannot afford to eat it. But the number of bread-eaters is\r\nsteadily increasing, probably at the rate of four or five million a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe nation that eats most bread per capita is Belgium. After her come\r\nFrance, England, and the United States. As the Belgians, with their\r\nscanty acres, cannot grow more wheat than would support them for nine\r\nweeks, they are compelled to import nearly fifty million bushels a year;\r\nand it is this continual influx of grain that has done most to make\r\nAntwerp the third busiest port in the world and the home of forty\r\nsteamship lines.\r\n\r\nFrance is second as an eater, and third as a grower, of wheat. But it is\r\nnot an important factor in the international market, as there is usually\r\nalmost an even balance between what it grows and what it eats. It has\r\nvery little either to buy or to sell. Its crops are steady and large,\r\nand by intensive cultivation the thrifty French are obtaining the same\r\namount of grain from less and less land.\r\n\r\nThere are two countries only, Great Britain and Holland, that impose no\r\ntariff upon either wheat or flour. Neither the British nor the Dutch\r\nwill tolerate a bread tax. Both countries have barely enough land to\r\ngrow one-quarter as much wheat as they need, although there was a period\r\nin the early history of England when it was nicknamed \"the Granary of\r\nthe North,\" because of its many wheat-fields. To-day the bread on three\r\nBritish tables out of four is made of wheat brought in a British ship\r\nfrom some foreign country; and the total amount of wheat consumed in the\r\nUnited Kingdom is so great that it requires an army of 93,000 men with\r\nself-binders to cut it and tie it into sheaves. If it had to be reaped\r\nwith sickles, it would be a ten-day harvesting for half the able-bodied\r\nmen in the two islands.\r\n\r\nGermany eats less wheat than Great Britain, and raises more than twice\r\nas much. The Germans are skilled wheat-farmers. They grow as much on\r\nhalf an acre of poor soil as Americans grow on a whole acre of good\r\nsoil. The Italians eat very nearly as much as the Germans, and raise a\r\nlarger crop by dint of great labor on the tiny farms and terraced\r\nhillsides of Italy. Both countries tax the bread of the poor by a tariff\r\nof thirty-eight to forty-eight cents a bushel on foreign wheat. The\r\nAustrians and Hungarians, in spite of a climate of extremes and sudden\r\nchanges, manage to supply themselves with more than ten billion loaves\r\nof bread by the tillage of their own fields, and usually have some flour\r\nto sell to the neighboring countries. The Spanish cannot quite feed\r\nthemselves; in addition to the wheat they grow, they are obliged to buy\r\nabout a hundred ship-loads a year. Denmark comes out even. Portugal buys\r\nher bread for four months of the year. Greece, Norway, and Sweden raise\r\nhalf enough wheat. The Swiss can get no more from their valley-farms\r\nthan will feed them for ten weeks. And the peasants of Russia and\r\nRoumania, who raise wheat in abundance, have unfortunately not yet risen\r\nto that luxurious level of life in which white bread is the every-day\r\nfood of the people. Although Russia has more wheat to sell than any\r\nother nation, a Russian eats one-third as much wheat as a Belgian, and\r\nthere is a famine somewhere in the vast Russian Empire almost every\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HARVEST SCENE UPON A RUSSIAN ESTATE]\r\n\r\nAfrica is not yet a wheat-eating continent. Egypt, which was, in the\r\nGolden Age of the Pharaohs, the wheat-centre of the world, now grows\r\nless grain than Oregon; Algeria raises less than Ohio; and Tunis, from\r\nthe fields that surround the ruins of ancient Carthage, produces less\r\ngrain than Tennessee. India is slowly shifting from rice to wheat. Many\r\nof the fields that once grew indigo are now yellow with grain. At\r\npresent India is the most uncertain factor in the situation, as it may\r\nhave eighty million bushels to sell or none. As it is one-third as large\r\nas the United States, and crowded with three times the population,\r\nthere is always need of its grain at home. As yet, the Reaper has not\r\nbeen allowed to extend its benefits to India. Most of the grain is\r\nreaped in the old slow, wasteful way. It is sown by hand, cut by\r\nsickles, stored in pits, and transported on the backs of camels. Little\r\nJapan is falling into line as a bread-eating country, growing now as\r\nmuch wheat as California. And even China, which is not as a whole on the\r\nwheat-map of the world, has recently begun to grow wheat in Manchuria\r\nand to build flour-mills at Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\nSo, the human race will soon be able to feed itself. It has learned how\r\nand needs only to use to the full the agencies that are already invented\r\nand established. Beginning with the McCormick Reaper in 1831, there has\r\nbeen constructed a world mechanism of the bread, which promises to\r\nwholly abolish Famine and its brood of evils. The crude machine that was\r\nhammered and whittled into shape in a log workshop on a Virginian farm,\r\nhas now become a System--a _McCormick System_, that cuts ten million\r\nbushels of ripe wheat a day and transports it hither and thither as\r\nhandily as though the whole round earth were girt with belt-conveyors.\r\n\r\nThat young Virginian farmer who awoke from his dream and made his dream\r\ncome true, made it possible for a few in each country to provide enough\r\nfood for all. He found a cure for Hunger, which had always persisted\r\nlike a chronic disease. He heaped the plates on the tables of thirty-six\r\nnations. He took a drudgery and transformed it into a profession. He\r\ninstructed the wheat-eating races how to increase the \"seven small\r\nloaves\" so that the multitudes should be fed. He picked up the task of\r\nfeeding the hungry masses--the Christly task that had lain unfulfilled\r\nfor eighteen centuries, and led the way in organizing it into a system\r\nof international reciprocity.\r\n\r\nTo-day there is no longer in most countries any tragic note in the Epic\r\nof the Wheat. There is no sweating peasant with a hoe. The plowman may\r\neven sit, if he wishes, upon the sliding steel knife that slices the\r\nsoil into furrows, or upon the steel harrow that combs the clods into\r\nsoft, loose earth. The sower is no heavy-footed serf, scattering his\r\ngrain in handfuls upon the surface of the soil, where the birds of the\r\nair may devour it. He, too, rides upon a machine with steel fingers that\r\nplant the living seed securely in the living earth. And when, at the\r\ncall of the sun and the rain, the black field becomes green and ripens\r\nfrom green to gold, its yellow fruitage is swept down and into barns,\r\nnot by a horde of stooping laborers, but by the Grand March of the\r\nHarvesters, the drivers of painted chariots, who ride against the grain\r\nand leave it behind them in bound sheaves.\r\n\r\nHenceforth civilization may be based upon higher motives than the Search\r\nfor Food. The struggle for existence may become the struggle of the\r\nnobler nature for its full development. The gentle need not be\r\neliminated by the strong. Instead of contending with one another in an\r\nunbrotherly competition, men may move upward to the higher activities of\r\nsocial self-preservation and organized self-help. By mastering the\r\nproblem of the bread, they have opened up such opportunities for\r\neducation, for travel, for happier homes, for the prosperity and\r\nfriendship of the nations, as no previous generation has ever had. And\r\nit is here, it is in this larger and kindlier civilization, that is now\r\nmade possible by the Reaper and the wheat-mechanism which has grown up\r\naround it, that we shall find the full spiritual value to the world of\r\nthat stout-hearted bread-winner of the human race whose life began among\r\nthe hills of Old Virginia one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Adams, John, 15\r\n\r\n  Adriance, John P., 103, 119\r\n\r\n  Advertisements of Reaper, 54, 81-83, 112, 134\r\n\r\n  Africa not a wheat-eating country, 242\r\n\r\n  Agencies established for sale of Reapers (about 1844), 63\r\n\r\n  Agents, Cyrus H.
