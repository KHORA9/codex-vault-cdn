Kendall_\r\n\r\nJOHN DEERE'S STEEL PLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n    _John Deere in 1837 invented a plow that could be used\r\n    successfully in the sticky, root-filled soil of the prairie.\r\n    It was called a steel plow. Actually, it appears that only the\r\n    cutting edge, the share, on the first Deere plows was steel.\r\n    The moldboard was smoothly ground wrought iron._\r\n\r\n    _Deere's invention succeeded because, as the durable steel\r\n    share of the plow cut through the heavy earth, the sticky soil\r\n    could find no place to cling on its polished surfaces._\r\n\r\nAmericans moving westward in the beginning of the 19th century soon\r\nencountered the prairie lands of what we now call the Middle West. The\r\ndark fertile soils promised great rewards to the farmers settling in\r\nthese regions, but also posed certain problems. First was the breaking\r\nof the tough prairie sod. The naturalist John Muir describes the\r\nconditions facing prairie farmers when he was a boy in the early 1850's\r\nas he tells of the use of the big prairie-breaking plows in the\r\nfollowing words:[1]\r\n\r\n    They were used only for the first ploughing, in breaking up\r\n    the wild sod woven into a tough mass, chiefly by the cord-like\r\n    roots of perennial grasses, reinforced by the tap roots of oak\r\n    and hickory bushes, called \"grubs,\" some of which were more\r\n    than a century old and four or five inches in diameter.... If\r\n    in good trim, the plough cut through and turned over these\r\n    grubs as if the century-old wood were soft like the flesh of\r\n    carrots and turnips; but if not in good trim the grubs\r\n    promptly tossed the plough out of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe second and greater problem was that the richer lands of the prairie\r\nbottoms, after a few years of continuous cultivation, became so sticky\r\nthat they clogged the moldboards of the plows. Clogging was such a\r\nfactor in prairie plowing that farmers in these regions carried a wooden\r\npaddle solely for cleaning off the moldboard, a task which had to be\r\nrepeated so frequently that it seriously interfered with plowing\r\nefficiency. It seems probable that by the 1830's blacksmiths in the\r\nprairie country were beginning to solve the problem of continuous\r\ncultivation of sticky prairie soil by nailing strips of saw steel to the\r\nface of wooden moldboard of the traditional plows. Figure 1 is a\r\nphotograph of an 18th century New England plow in the collection of the\r\nU. S. National Museum. This is one type of plow which was brought west\r\nby the settlers. It contributed to the development of the prairie\r\nbreaker shown in figure 2. The first plow on record with strips of steel\r\non the moldboard is attributed to John Lane in Chicago in 1833.[2] Steel\r\npresented a smoother surface which shed the sticky loam better than the\r\nconventional wooden moldboards covered with wrought iron, or the cast\r\niron moldboards of the newer factory-made plows then coming into use.\r\n\r\nIt is generally accepted as historical fact that John Deere made his\r\nfirst steel plow in 1837 at Grand Detour, Illinois. The details of the\r\nconstruction of this plow have been variously given by different\r\nwriters. Ardrey[3] and Davidson[4] describe Deere's original plow as\r\nhaving a wooden moldboard covered with strips of steel cut from a saw,\r\nin the manner of the John Lane plow.\r\n\r\n[Sidebar: THE AUTHOR:\r\n\r\n_Edward C. Kendall is curator of agriculture, Museum of History and\r\nTechnology, in the Smithsonian Institution's United States National\r\nMuseum._]\r\n\r\nIn recent years the 1837 Deere plow has been pictured quite differently.\r\nThis has apparently come about as the result of the discovery of an old\r\nplow identified as one made by John Deere at Grand Detour in 1838 and\r\nsold to Joseph Brierton from whose farm it was obtained in 1901 by the\r\nmaker's son, Charles H. Deere. He brought it to the office of Deere &\r\nCompany at Moline, Illinois, for preservation and display. This plow is\r\nshown in figures 7 and 9. In 1938 Deere & Company presented it to the U.\r\nS. National Museum, where it is on display. It can be seen that the\r\nmoldboard is made of one curved diamond-shaped metal slab. This plow\r\nbottom conforms to the description of the \"diamond\" plows manufactured\r\nby Deere in the 1840's.[5] The Company states that according to its\r\nrecords, this was one of three plows made by Deere in 1838 and that it\r\nwas probably substantially identical with the first one made in 1837.[6]\r\nIt may be difficult to prove that the Museum's specimen was made in\r\n1838, but a comparison of this plow (fig. 7) with the 1847 moldboard\r\n(fig. 5) and the 1855 plow (fig. 6) suggests that the Museum's plow is\r\nthe earliest of the three, since there is particularly evident an\r\nevolution of the shape of the moldboard from a simple, almost crude form\r\nto a more sophisticated shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--NEW ENGLAND STRONG PLOW, MID-18TH CENTURY.\r\nColter locked into heavy, broad share; wooden moldboard covered with\r\niron strips. (_Cat. no. F1091_; _Smithsonian photo 13214_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEERE AND ANDRUS\r\n\r\nWriters of the 20th century describing the making of the first John\r\nDeere steel plow have in mind the 1838 plow. One[7] has John Deere\r\npondering the local plowing problem and getting an idea from the\r\npolished surface of a broken steel mill saw. Another[8] claims that\r\nLeonard Andrus, the founder and leading figure of Grand Detour and part\r\nowner of the sawmill, conceived the design of the plow and employed\r\nDeere, the blacksmith newly arrived from Vermont, to build it. This idea\r\nmay have originated with and was certainly promoted by the late Fred A.\r\nWirt, as advertising manager of the J. I. Case Company. It is difficult,\r\nat this distance, to determine the parts played at the beginning by\r\nDeere and Andrus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--LARGE PRAIRIE-BREAKING PLOW, MID-19TH CENTURY.\r\nWheels underneath the beam regulate the depth of plowing; large wheel\r\nruns in the furrow, small wheel on the land. The colter is braced at the\r\nbottom as well as at the top. The share cuts a broad, shallow strip of\r\nsod which the long, gently curving moldboard turns over unbroken.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest existing partnership agreement involving Andrus and Deere\r\nis dated March 20, 1843.[9] The existing copy is unsigned, but its\r\nconditions are the same as those in the agreements executed during the\r\nnext few years. It began by stating that Deere and Andrus had agreed \"to\r\nbecome copartners together in the art and trade of Blacksmithing,\r\nploughmaking and all things thereto belonging at the said Grand Detour,\r\nand all other business that the said parties may hereafter deem\r\nnecessary for their mutual interest and benefit ...\" One of the terms\r\nwas that the copartnership should continue from the date of the\r\nagreement \"under the name and firm of Leonard Andrus.\"\r\n\r\nA second agreement dated October 26, 1844,[10] which brought in a third\r\npartner, Horace Paine, described the business as \"the art and trade of\r\nBlacksmithing Plough Making Iron Castings and all things thereto\r\nbelonging ...\" and stated that the copartnership should be conducted\r\n\"under the name and firm of L. Andrus and Co.\" The third agreement,\r\ndated October 20, 1846, in which another man appeared in place of Paine,\r\ngave the name of the firm as Andrus, Deere, and Lathrop.[11] This\r\ncarried an addendum dated June 22, 1847, in which Andrus and Deere\r\nbought out Lathrop's interest in the business and agreed to continue\r\nunder the name of Andrus and Deere. This is the only mention of the firm\r\nof Andrus and Deere. It could only have lasted a few months because it\r\nwas in 1847 that Deere moved to Moline and established his plow factory\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--RECONSTRUCTIONS OF JOHN DEERE'S 1837 PLOW. For\r\na discussion of the position and attachment of the handles see p. 24.\r\n(_Deere & Company photo_.)]\r\n\r\nThese agreements suggest that Leonard Andrus was the capitalist of the\r\nyoung community of Grand Detour, as well as its founder. The dominance\r\nof the name Andrus tends to back up the opinion which holds that Andrus\r\nwas the leading figure in the development of the successful prairie\r\nplow. On the other hand, the general tone of the agreements suggests\r\nthat two or more people were participating in an enterprise in which\r\neach contributed to the business and shared in the results. Deere\r\ncontributed his plow and his blacksmith shop, tools, and outbuildings;\r\nAndrus contributed money and business experience. There is no indication\r\nthat they were formally associated prior to the agreement of March 20,\r\n1843. An advertisement (it is quoted later) dated February 3, 1843, and\r\nappearing in the March 10, 1843, issue of the _Rock River Register_,\r\ncarries an announcement by John Deere that he is ready to fill orders\r\nfor plows, which he then describes. There is no mention of Andrus or of\r\nan Andrus and Deere firm. I am inclined by the evidence to the view that\r\nDeere worked out his plow by himself, began to manufacture it in small\r\nnumbers, needed money to enlarge and expand his operations, and went to\r\nthe logical source of capital in the community, Leonard Andrus.\r\n\r\nIn support of this view I quote a statement by Mr. Burton F. Peek[12]\r\nwho has spent most of his life in Deere & Company and who may now be the\r\nonly person living who knew John Deere:\r\n\r\n    Andrus removed to Grand de Tour from some place in New York\r\n    [Rochester, though originally from Vermont]. Some years later\r\n    John Deere came along from Rutland, Vermont leaving his family\r\n    behind him. Whether Deere ever heard of Andrus or Andrus of\r\n    Deere no one knows.\r\n\r\n    Having decided to remain in Grand de Tour, Deere sent for his\r\n    family asking my paternal grandfather, William Peek, to bring\r\n    them and also the Peek family out to Grand de Tour. This was\r\n    done via covered wagon the journey occupying some six weeks.\r\n    My father, Henry C. Peek, was then an infant age six weeks and\r\n    Charles Deere, the son of John, an infant of about the same\r\n    age. Of course these infants came along sleeping in the feed\r\n    box of the wagon. My grandfather \"took up land\" adjacent to\r\n    Grand de Tour and John Deere continued in the manufacturing\r\n    business.\r\n\r\n    Incidentally, John Deere and William Peek were brothers-in-law\r\n    having married sisters and what I have said, and much more\r\n    that I might say to you, is based upon what I have been told\r\n    by my grandfather, by John Deere and by others who had a part\r\n    in the early history of the company. So far as I know, I am\r\n    the only living person who ever knew or saw John Deere....\r\n\r\n    ... I joined the Deere Company on October 1, 1888, at the age\r\n    of 16 and retired on the 28th of April, 1956--nearly 68 years.\r\n    C. H. Deere was my great friend and benefactor. I was educated\r\n    at his expense as a lawyer and practiced for thirteen years.\r\n    During this time I was his personal attorney, I drew his will,\r\n    was made trustee thereunder, and probably was more intimate\r\n    with him than any living person. I have seen and read the\r\n    manuscript of an early history of the company which he wrote,\r\n    but never published and there was nothing in it to indicate\r\n    that Andrus had any part in the manufacture of the first\r\n    successful steel plow and it is my firm belief that he had no\r\n    part other than perhaps a friendly interest in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PLOW\r\n\r\nMost writers describe Deere cutting a diamond-shaped piece out of a\r\nbroken steel mill saw. There is usually no further identification of the\r\ntype of saw beyond the statement that it came from the Andrus sawmill.\r\nNeil Clark, author of a brief biography of John Deere, states that the\r\ndiamond-shaped piece was cut out of a circular saw.[13] There is no\r\nevidence given to support this. There are some powerful arguments\r\nagainst it. The circular saw, especially of the larger size, was\r\nprobably not very common in America in the 1830's. Although an English\r\npatent for a circular saw was issued in 1777 the first circular saw in\r\nAmerica is attributed to Benjamin Cummins of Bentonsville, New York,\r\nabout 1814.[14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--HOW DEERE PROBABLY CUT AND BENT THE FLAT PLATE\r\nof his 1838 plow to form the moldboard and landside. Because of the\r\nshape of the moldboard it became known as the diamond plow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--MOLDBOARD OF 1847 JOHN DEERE PLOW, showing how\r\nthe diamond shape of the original design has been slightly modified.\r\n(_Deere & Company photo 57192-D_.)]\r\n\r\nIn a small, new, pioneering community it seems unlikely that the local\r\nsawmill would have been equipped with the newer circular saw rather than\r\nthe familiar up and down saw which remained in use throughout the 19th\r\ncentury and, in places, well into the 20th century. The up and down saw\r\nwas a broad strip of iron or steel with large teeth in one edge. Driven\r\nby water power it slowly cut large logs into boards. It is doubtful that\r\nthe circular saws of that period were large enough for this kind of mill\r\nwork. The second argument is the shape of the moldboard itself. The\r\nphotograph of the 1838 plow in figure 7 shows that the shape of the\r\nmoldboard is unconventional. It is essentially a parallelogram curved to\r\npresent a concave surface to the furrow slice and thus to make a simple,\r\nsmall but workable plow. A parallelogram or diamond would be an easy\r\nshape to cut out of a mill saw with the teeth removed. The moldboard on\r\nthe 1838 plow is from .228 to .238 inches thick and its width is 12\r\ninches. These dimensions approximate those given in an 1897 Disston\r\ncatalog[15] which describes mulay saws, a type of mill saw, from 10 to\r\n12 inches wide and from 4 to 9 gauge. Gauge number 4 is the thickest and\r\nis .238 inches.\r\n\r\nExamination of the 1838 plow suggests that Deere cut the moldboard and\r\nlandside as one piece, which was then heated and bent to the desired\r\nform. The pattern of this piece is shown in figure 4. Some additional\r\nmetal appears to be forged into the sharp bend at the junction of the\r\nmoldboard and the landside apparently to strengthen this part, which may\r\nhave begun to open during the bending. If, however, Deere had used a\r\nlarge circular saw with plenty of room for cutting out a moldboard of\r\nthe usual shape and size, it seems likely that he would have made a plow\r\nof more conventional appearance. In any event his moldboard of one\r\njointless piece of polished metal would scour better than one of wood\r\ncovered with strips of steel since the nailheads and the joints between\r\nthe strips would provide places for the earth to stick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--THE SHAPE OF THE MOLDBOARD continued to\r\nevolve, as illustrated by this 1855 John Deere plow. (_Deere & Company\r\nphoto 57192-A_.)]\r\n\r\nA very great majority of writers describing John Deere and his plow\r\nattribute his fame to his development of a successful steel plow which\r\nmade cultivation of rich prairie soil practical. The emphasis is always\r\non the development of a steel moldboard and the assumption is that from\r\nthe 1837 plow onward stretched an unbroken line of steel moldboard\r\nplows. An advertisement for John Deere plows in the March 10, 1843,\r\nissue of the _Rock River Register_, published weekly in Grand Detour,\r\nIllinois, gives a detailed description, here presented in full:\r\n\r\n    John Deere respectfully informs his friends and customers, the\r\n    agricultural community, of this and adjoining counties, and\r\n    dealers in Ploughs, that he is now prepared to fill orders for\r\n    the same on presentation.\r\n\r\n    The Moldboard of this well, and so favorably known PLOUGH, is\r\n    made of wrought iron, and the share of steel, 5/16 of an inch\r\n    thick, which carries a fine sharp edge. The whole face of the\r\n    moldboard and share is ground smooth, so that it scours\r\n    perfectly bright in any soil, and will not choke in the\r\n    foulest of ground. It will do more work in a day, and do it\r\n    much better and with less labor, to both team and holder, than\r\n    the ordinary ploughs that do not scour, and in consequence of\r\n    the ground being better prepared, the agriculturalist obtains\r\n    a much heavier crop.\r\n\r\n    The price of Ploughs, in consequence of hard times, will be\r\n    reduced from last year's prices. Grand Detour, Feb. 3, 1843.\r\n\r\nThis raised two questions: Why, and for how long, was wrought iron used\r\nfor the moldboards of the Deere plows? Of what material is the moldboard\r\nof the 1838 plow made? During the first few years, when production was\r\nvery small, there were probably enough worn out mill saws available for\r\nthe relatively few plows made. As production increased this source must\r\nhave become inadequate. Ardrey gives the following figures for the\r\nproduction of plows by Deere and Andrus:[16] 1839, 10 plows; 1840, 40\r\nplows; 1841, 75 plows; 1842, 100 plows; 1843, 400 plows. Ardrey states\r\nfurther that \"by this time the difficulty of obtaining steel in the\r\nquantity and quality needed had become a serious obstacle in the way of\r\nfurther development.\" The statement, quoted above, that the moldboard\r\nwas of wrought iron and the statistics on production of plows during the\r\n1840's and 1850's belie Ardrey's claim that it was a serious obstacle,\r\nnor is there any suggestion in the advertisement that wrought iron was\r\nbeing substituted for steel.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 John Deere amicably severed relations with the firm of Andrus &\r\nDeere and moved to Moline, Illinois, to continue plow manufacturing in a\r\nsite that had better transportation facilities than Grand Detour. The\r\nnew firm produced 700 plows in the first year, 1600 in 1850, and 10,000\r\nin 1857.[17] Swank[18] states that the first slab of cast plow steel\r\never rolled in the United States was in 1846 and that it was shipped to\r\nJohn Deere of Moline, Illinois. A little later he says that it was not\r\nuntil the early 1860's in this country that several firms succeeded in\r\nmaking high grade crucible cast steel of uniform quality as a regular\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--JOHN DEERE'S 1838 PLOW, RIGHT SIDE, showing\r\nlarge iron staple used to fasten end of right handle to the standard.\r\nNote remains of wooden pin near rear end of plow beam. (_Cat. no.\r\nF1111_; _Smithsonian photo 42639-A_.)]\r\n\r\nBased on a visit to Deere's factory in 1857 the _Country Gentleman_[19]\r\ngave the yearly output as 13,400 plows. It pictured four of seven models\r\nand stated, \"these are all made of cast steel, and perfectly polished\r\nbefore they are sent out, and are kept bright by use, so that no soil\r\nadheres to them.\" The article then gives the tonnages of iron and steel\r\nused by the Deere factory in a year. They are as follows: 50 tons cast\r\nsteel, 40 tons German steel, 100 tons Pittsburgh steel, 75 tons\r\ncastings, 200 tons wrought iron, 8 tons malleable castings in clevises,\r\netc. In addition 100,000 plow bolts and 200,000 feet of oak plank were\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThese figures do not indicate what the different parts of the plows were\r\nmade of but, if approximately correct, they do show that more than half\r\nthe metal used was iron rather than steel. Steel accounts for 190 tons;\r\nwrought iron for 200. Although it is conceivable, under this weight\r\ndistribution, that the shares and moldboards were made of steel while\r\nthe landsides and standards were made of wrought iron, other\r\ndistributions are also possible, and it is quite conceivable that at\r\nthis period some of the plows had steel moldboards while others had\r\nwrought-iron ones. An analysis of the metal in different parts of an\r\n1855 John Deere plow, now at the factory in Moline, may shed some light\r\non this, but from these figures and dates it seems likely that most of\r\nJohn Deere's plows during the 1840's and 1850's had wrought-iron\r\nmoldboards with steel shares. (It should be borne in mind that the\r\npoorer grades of steel available at this time were probably no more\r\nsatisfactory than cast iron as far as scouring clean in sticky soil was\r\nconcerned.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--RECONSTRUCTION OF DEERE'S 1838 PLOW, right\r\nside, with handles shown in what is believed to be their original\r\nposition. (_Smithsonian photo 42647_.)]\r\n\r\nThe question of the material in the moldboard of the 1838 plow was\r\nanswered when a spark-test analysis was made of the metal in the\r\nmoldboard and share. In this test the color, shape, and pattern of the\r\nspark bursts produced by a high-speed grinding wheel indicate the type\r\nof iron or steel. Several spots along the edges and back surface of the\r\nmoldboard were tested. No carbon bursts were seen in the spark\r\npatterns, indicating that the material was wrought iron. The share\r\nconsists of a piece, wedge shaped in cross section, welded on to the\r\nlower, or front, edge of the moldboard. This was tested at several spots\r\nalong its sharp edge, all of which gave a pattern and color indicating\r\nthat the material was medium high carbon steel. This test was\r\ncorroborated by a chemical analysis of filings from the moldboard and\r\nshare in a metallurgical laboratory. A small trace of carbon was found\r\nin the moldboard. It may be present as the result of contamination from\r\nseveral sources, a likely one being the charcoal fire in the forge when\r\nit was heated for bending and shaping.[20]\r\n\r\nThese tests agree perfectly with the description in the 1843\r\nadvertisement. It seems, therefore, that Deere's success in making plows\r\nthat worked well in prairie bottom lands depended as much on the smooth\r\nsurface he produced by grinding and polishing as on the material used.\r\n\r\nThe filing of the edge of the moldboard for the metallurgical test\r\ndisclosed that the wrought-iron slab consisted of five thin laminations\r\napparently forged together but with separations visible. The length and\r\nregularity of the lines of separation seem to preclude their being\r\nstriations resulting from the fibrous structure of wrought iron. This\r\ncalls into question the theory that the moldboard and landside were cut\r\nfrom a mill saw, since it hardly seems likely that a saw would be made\r\nof laminated material. The possibility exists that the body of the mill\r\nsaw might have been made this way, with a tooth-bearing steel edge\r\nwelded on, but there seems little reason for making a saw out of thin\r\nlaminations. It is also possible that this laminated iron originally had\r\nbeen intended for some other purpose, such as boiler plate, and may have\r\nbeen available in rectangular pieces. In making the 1838 plow Deere\r\nfollowed a pattern (fig. 4), which suggests that he cut it out of such a\r\npiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--JOHN DEERE'S 1838 PLOW, LEFT SIDE, showing\r\ndetails of construction and relationship of landside to moldboard.\r\n(_Cat. no. F1111_; _Smithsonian photo 42639_.)]\r\n\r\nSince the moldboard of the 1838 plow is of wrought iron, and since this\r\nplow is thought to be essentially identical with the first one Deere\r\nmade in 1837, it is highly probable that the 1837 plow also had a\r\nwrought-iron moldboard, a condition which appears to have been the basic\r\npattern for John Deere plows until the middle 1850's.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY A \"STEEL\" PLOW\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts and the probabilities based on them, how is the\r\nlegend of the John Deere steel plow to be explained? There are several\r\nlikely reasons. It is possible that the first plow, in 1837, was made\r\nfrom a broken steel mill saw. It is also possible that within a few\r\nyears puddled iron came to be used for the moldboards because of the\r\nscarcity of suitable steel, either in the form of broken mill saws or as\r\nplates ordered from foundries in America (the high price of steel\r\nimported from England made this an impractical source). However, it\r\nseems more likely that it became known as a steel plow owing to the\r\nimportance Deere attached to his plows having steel shares, as shown in\r\nhis advertisement in 1843. A steel share, tougher than cast iron, would\r\nhold an edge much better than wrought iron, and John Muir's description\r\nof prairie plowing, quoted earlier, substantiates the importance of a\r\ntough, sharp share.\r\n\r\nDeere's plows, probably distinctive by reason of their steel shares, may\r\nhave been called \"steel\" plows, in the regions where they were used, to\r\ndistinguish them from the standard wooden plows and from the newer\r\ncast-iron implements. The term \"wooden plow\" has a similar history. For\r\nwell over 2000 years in Europe some plows have been made with iron\r\nshares and the rest of the structure wood. Plows in 18th-century America\r\nwere made principally of wood with iron shares, colters, and clevises,\r\nand with strips of iron frequently covering the wooden moldboard. These\r\nimplements were called, simply, plows of various regional types. Not\r\nuntil the development and spread of the factory-made plows with\r\ncast-iron moldboards, landsides, and standards did the term \"wooden\r\nplow\" come into use to differentiate all these plows from the newer\r\nones. Subsequently writers have been led to assume that \"wooden plow\"\r\nmeant a plow with no iron parts and consequently to make unwarranted\r\nstatements about the primitiveness of the 18th-century implements.\r\n\r\nA second reason for use of the term \"steel plow\" may have developed from\r\nthe supposition that the moldboards of the first John Deere plows were\r\nmade of diamond-shaped sections cut from old mill saws, which later\r\nwriters seem to have assumed were made of steel. (It is probable that\r\nfrom the late 1850's on Deere plows had steel moldboards.) However, mill\r\nsaws of the early 19th century were not necessarily made of steel, which\r\nwas then relatively expensive. I have been told of an old mill saw made\r\nof wrought iron on which was welded a steel edge that carried the\r\nteeth.[21] Rees' _Cyclopaedia_[22] describes saws as being made of\r\neither wrought iron or steel, the latter being preferable. Therefore, it\r\nseems most likely that Deere's plows, from his first until the middle\r\n1850's were made with highly polished wrought-iron moldboards and steel\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThe remains of the 1838 plow are shown in figures 7 and 9. One's\r\ncuriosity is aroused as to what the plow looked like in its original\r\nstate, complete with handles. Several full-scale 3-dimensional\r\nreconstructions and a number of sketches of the 1837 plow have been\r\nmade. The reconstructions all must have been based on the remains of the\r\n1838 plow, since they resemble it closely and it is the only surviving\r\nplow of this type known.\r\n\r\nRecently I received a photograph (fig. 3, right) of a plow which has\r\nbeen boxed and in storage for many years at Deere & Company which may be\r\nan early Deere plow. As it appears in the photograph, the plow looks\r\nunconvincing. The handles are fastened by bolts and nuts, a manner\r\nuncommon in American plow making in the early 19th century. The shape of\r\nthe handles is that of stock handles available for small plows and\r\ncultivators in such a catalog as Belknap's. The plow seems very high and\r\nweakly braced. There is no logical reason for curving the end of the\r\nbeam down and cutting it off at a slant if the handles are attached in\r\nthe manner shown. The edges of the tenon on the upper end of the\r\nstandard where it goes through the mortise in the beam have been neatly\r\nbeveled in a manner I have never seen before on any other plow. All of\r\nthis leads me to think that this is an early reconstruction based on the\r\nremains of the 1838 plow which it only roughly approximates in\r\nproportion and design.\r\n\r\nAnother of these reconstructions is shown in figure 3, left. Although\r\nsuperficially like the 1838 plow it varies considerably in its\r\nproportions, in the angular relations of its parts, and in other details\r\nsuch as the use of iron bolts and nuts in place of wooden pins. All\r\nthese reconstructions agree in one thing. They show a plow with handles\r\nfastened to both sides of the plow beam and standard.\r\n\r\nDuring an examination of the 1838 plow it occurred to me that there was\r\nno indication of an attachment of a handle on the landside in the same\r\nmanner as on the furrow side. The position and attachment of the handle\r\nin figure 7 is clearly indicated by the remains of a wooden pin in the\r\nside of the plow beam near the rear end and by the large iron staple, in\r\nthe side of the standard, which must have held the tapered lower end of\r\nthe handle. Figure 8 is a sketch showing this handle in position. The\r\nlandside view of this plow in figure 9 shows that the pin did not extend\r\nthrough the beam nor are there marks on the standard to indicate the\r\nposition of a staple like that on the furrow side. The four holes\r\napproximately in line on the standard and beam show where a piece of\r\nsheet metal had been nailed to hold the beam and standard in about the\r\nright position. The outline of the sheet metal can be seen on the side\r\nof the beam. This was removed at the time this examination was made.\r\n\r\nHow was the landside handle attached? W. E. Bridges of the National\r\nMuseum suggests that it might have been attached to the lower side of\r\nthe standard and the rear end of the plow beam. This seems, beyond\r\ndoubt, to be correct. The wood has deteriorated considerably over the\r\nyears and the joints are loose, but, within the limits of the existing\r\nstructure, the plow beam can easily be set in such a position that its\r\nsloping rear end lines up with the slope of the underside of the\r\nstandard. Furthermore, a long bolt runs from the upper part of the\r\nmoldboard through the standard and projects quite far beyond its lower\r\nsurface, as can be seen in figure 7. The end of the bolt is threaded\r\nonly part way and it has been necessary to put a cylindrical metal\r\nspacer on it in order to draw up the nut snugly. This long bolt must\r\noriginally have passed through the lower end of the handle, which, in\r\nturn, was fastened to the end of the plow beam by a tenon on the end of\r\nthe beam, now broken off, passing through a mortise in the handle. This\r\nwas the common method of fastening the handle to the beam. The square\r\nhole in the plow's iron landside (fig. 7), which at first might seem\r\nmeant for another bolt passing through the lower end of the handle at\r\nright angles to the long bolt, seems too close to the other bolt and to\r\nthe edges of the handle. It may simply be a first try for the bolt\r\nthrough the bottom of the standard. In this manner the handle would have\r\nbeen strongly attached to the plow frame and, at the same time, would\r\nhave materially helped to make it rigid by forming one side of a\r\ntriangular structure. Figures 8 and 10 show what I believe to be the\r\ncorrect reconstruction of the 1838 Deere plow along the lines just\r\ndescribed and, therefore, the probable appearance of the 1837 plow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--RECONSTRUCTION OF DEERE'S 1838 PLOW, left\r\nside, showing how left handle is believed to have been attached.\r\n(_Smithsonian photo 42637_.)]\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that it was general practice in making fixed\r\nmoldboard plows to have the plow beam, standard, handle, and landside\r\n(or sharebeam, on the old plows) in the same plane. Symmetrical handles\r\nbranching from both sides of the beam are found on cultivators, shovel\r\nplows, middle busters, and sidehill plows where the moldboard is turned\r\nalternately to each side.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SUMMARY--\r\n\r\nThe existing evidence, I believe, indicates that:\r\n\r\n1. The successful prairie plow with a smooth one-piece moldboard and\r\nsteel share was basically Deere's idea.\r\n\r\n2. The moldboards of practically all of his plows, from 1837 and for\r\nabout 15 years, were made of wrought iron rather than steel.\r\n\r\n3. The success of his plows in the prairie soils depended on a steel\r\nshare which held a sharp edge and a highly polished moldboard to which\r\nthe sticky soils could not cling.\r\n\r\n4. The importance attached to the steel share led to the plows being\r\nidentified as steel plows.\r\n\r\n5. The correct reconstruction of the 1838 plow, and, by inference, the\r\n1837 plow, is shown in figures 8 and 10, previous reconstructions being\r\nwrong primarily in the position and attachment of the handles.\r\n\r\n6. The Museum's John Deere plow (Cat. No. F1111), shown in figures 7 and\r\n9, is a very early specimen, on the basis of a comparison of it with\r\nDeere moldboards of 1847 and 1855 and its conformity to Deere's\r\ndescription of his plows in an 1843 advertisement; and the 1838 date\r\nassociated with it is plausible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] John Muir (1838-1914), _The story of my boyhood and youth_, Boston,\r\n1913, pp. 227, 228.\r\n\r\n[2] R.
