APPLETON AND COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present work is not a compendium of astronomy or an outline course\r\nof popular reading in that science. It has been prepared as a text-book,\r\nand the author has purposely omitted from it much matter interesting as\r\nwell as important to a complete view of the science, and has endeavored\r\nto concentrate attention upon those parts of the subject that possess\r\nspecial educational value. From this point of view matter which permits\r\nof experimental treatment with simple apparatus is of peculiar value and\r\nis given a prominence in the text beyond its just due in a well-balanced\r\nexposition of the elements of astronomy, while topics, such as the\r\nresults of spectrum analysis, which depend upon elaborate apparatus, are\r\nin the experimental part of the work accorded much less space than their\r\nintrinsic importance would justify.\r\n\r\nTeacher and student are alike urged to magnify the observational side of\r\nthe subject and to strive to obtain in their work the maximum degree of\r\nprecision of which their apparatus is capable. The instruments required\r\nare few and easily obtained. With exception of a watch and a protractor,\r\nall of the apparatus needed may be built by any one of fair mechanical\r\ntalent who will follow the illustrations and descriptions of the text.\r\nIn order that proper opportunity for observations may be had, the study\r\nshould be pursued during the milder portion of the year, between April\r\nand November in northern latitudes, using clear weather for a direct\r\nstudy of the sky and cloudy days for book work.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations contained in the present work are worthy of as careful\r\nstudy as is the text, and many of them are intended as an aid to\r\nexperimental work and accurate measurement, e. g., the star maps, the\r\ndiagrams of the planetary orbits, pictures of the moon, sun, etc. If the\r\nschool possesses a projection lantern, a set of astronomical slides to\r\nbe used in connection with it may be made of great advantage, if the\r\npictures are studied as an auxiliary to Nature. Mere display and scenic\r\neffect are of little value.\r\n\r\nA brief bibliography of popular literature upon astronomy may be found\r\nat the end of this book, and it will be well if at least a part of these\r\nworks can be placed in the school library and systematically used for\r\nsupplementary reading. An added interest may be given to the study if\r\none or more of the popular periodicals which deal with astronomy are\r\ntaken regularly by the school and kept within easy reach of the\r\nstudents. From time to time the teacher may well assign topics treated\r\nin these periodicals to be read by individual students and presented to\r\nthe class in the form of an essay.\r\n\r\nThe author is under obligations to many of his professional friends who\r\nhave contributed illustrative matter for his text, and his thanks are in\r\nan especial manner due to the editors of the Astrophysical Journal,\r\nAstronomy and Astrophysics, and Popular Astronomy for permission to\r\nreproduce here plates which have appeared in those periodicals, and to\r\nDr. Charles Boynton, who has kindly read and criticised the proofs.\r\n\r\n                                                  GEORGE C.

ACCURATE MEASUREMENT.--Accurate measurement is the foundation of\r\nexact science, and at the very beginning of his study in astronomy the\r\nstudent should learn something of the astronomer's kind of measurement.\r\nHe should practice measuring the stars with all possible care, and\r\nshould seek to attain the most accurate results of which his instruments\r\nand apparatus are capable. The ordinary affairs of life furnish abundant\r\nillustration of some of these measurements, such as finding the length\r\nof a board in inches or the weight of a load of coal in pounds and\r\nmeasurements of both length and weight are of importance in astronomy,\r\nbut of far greater astronomical importance than these are the\r\nmeasurement of angles and the measurement of time. A kitchen clock or a\r\ncheap watch is usually thought of as a machine to tell the \"time of\r\nday,\" but it may be used to time a horse or a bicycler upon a race\r\ncourse, and then it becomes an instrument to measure the amount of time\r\nrequired for covering the length of the course. Astronomers use a clock\r\nin both of these ways--to tell the time at which something happens or is\r\ndone, and to measure the amount of time required for something; and in\r\nusing a clock for either purpose the student should learn to take the\r\ntime from it to the nearest second or better, if it has a seconds hand,\r\nor to a small fraction of a minute, by estimating the position of the\r\nminute hand between the minute marks on the dial. Estimate the fraction\r\nin tenths of a minute, not in halves or quarters.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 1.--If several watches are available, let one person tap\r\nsharply upon a desk with a pencil and let each of the others note the\r\ntime by the minute hand to the nearest tenth of a minute and record the\r\nobservations as follows:\r\n\r\n    2h. 44.5m.  First tap.   2h. 46.4m.  1.9m.\r\n    2h. 44.9m.  Second tap.  2h. 46.7m.  1.8m.\r\n    2h. 46.6m.  Third tap.   2h. 48.6m.  2.0m.\r\n\r\nThe letters h and m are used as abbreviations for hour and minute. The\r\nfirst and second columns of the table are the record made by one\r\nstudent, and second and third the record made by another. After all the\r\nobservations have been made and recorded they should be brought together\r\nand compared by taking the differences between the times recorded for\r\neach tap, as is shown in the last column. This difference shows how much\r\nfaster one watch is than the other, and the agreement or disagreement of\r\nthese differences shows the degree of accuracy of the observations. Keep\r\nup this practice until tenths of a minute can be estimated with fair\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n2. ANGLES AND THEIR USE.--An angle is the amount of opening or\r\ndifference of direction between two lines that cross each other. At\r\ntwelve o'clock the hour and minute hand of a watch point in the same\r\ndirection and the angle between them is zero. At one o'clock the minute\r\nhand is again at XII, but the hour hand has moved to I, one twelfth part\r\nof the circumference of the dial, and the angle between the hands is one\r\ntwelfth of a circumference. It is customary to imagine the circumference\r\nof a dial to be cut up into 360 equal parts--i. e., each minute space of\r\nan ordinary dial to be subdivided into six equal parts, each of which\r\nis called a degree, and the measurement of an angle consists in finding\r\nhow many of these degrees are included in the opening between its sides.\r\nAt one o'clock the angle between the hands of a watch is thirty degrees,\r\nwhich is usually written 30°, at three o'clock it is 90°, at six o'clock\r\n180°, etc.\r\n\r\nA watch may be used to measure angles. How? But a more convenient\r\ninstrument is the protractor, which is shown in Fig. 1, applied to the\r\nangle _A B C_ and showing that _A B C_ = 85° as nearly as the protractor\r\nscale can be read.\r\n\r\nThe student should have and use a protractor, such as is furnished with\r\nthis book, for the numerous exercises which are to follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--A protractor.]\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 2.--Draw neatly a triangle with sides about 100 millimeters\r\nlong, measure each of its angles and take their sum. No matter what may\r\nbe the shape of the triangle, this sum should be very nearly\r\n180°--exactly 180° if the work were perfect--but perfection can seldom\r\nbe attained and one of the first lessons to be learned in any science\r\nwhich deals with measurement is, that however careful we may be in our\r\nwork some minute error will cling to it and our results can be only\r\napproximately correct. This, however, should not be taken as an excuse\r\nfor careless work, but rather as a stimulus to extra effort in order\r\nthat the unavoidable errors may be made as small as possible. In the\r\npresent case the measured angles may be improved a little by adding\r\n(algebraically) to each of them one third of the amount by which their\r\nsum falls short of 180°, as in the following example:\r\n\r\n            Measured angles.    Correction.  Corrected angles.\r\n                 °                   °              °\r\n  A            73.4               + 0.1           73.5\r\n  B            49.3               + 0.1           49.4\r\n  C            57.0               + 0.1           57.1\r\n              -----                              -----\r\n  Sum         179.7                              180.0\r\n  Defect      + 0.3\r\n\r\nThis process is in very common use among astronomers, and is called\r\n\"adjusting\" the observations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Triangulation.]\r\n\r\n3. TRIANGLES.--The instruments used by astronomers for the measurement\r\nof angles are usually provided with a telescope, which may be pointed at\r\ndifferent objects, and with a scale, like that of the protractor, to\r\nmeasure the angle through which the telescope is turned in passing from\r\none object to another. In this way it is possible to measure the angle\r\nbetween lines drawn from the instrument to two distant objects, such as\r\ntwo church steeples or the sun and moon, and this is usually called the\r\nangle between the objects. By measuring angles in this way it is\r\npossible to determine the distance to an inaccessible point, as shown in\r\nFig. 2. A surveyor at _A_ desires to know the distance to _C_, on the\r\nopposite side of a river which he can not cross. He measures with a tape\r\nline along his own side of the stream the distance _A B_ = 100 yards and\r\nthen, with a suitable instrument, measures the angle at _A_ between the\r\npoints _C_ and _B_, and the angle at _B_ between _C_ and _A_, finding _B\r\nA C_ = 73.4°, _A B C_ = 49.3°. To determine the distance _A C_ he draws\r\nupon paper a line 100 millimeters long, and marks the ends _a_ and _b_;\r\nwith a protractor he constructs at _a_ the angle _b a c_ = 73.4°, and at\r\n_b_ the angle _a b c_ = 49.3°, and marks by _c_ the point where the two\r\nlines thus drawn meet. With the millimeter scale he now measures the\r\ndistance _a c_ = 90.2 millimeters, which determines the distance _A C_\r\nacross the river to be 90.2 yards, since the triangle on paper has been\r\nmade similar to the one across the river, and millimeters on the one\r\ncorrespond to yards on the other. What is the proposition of geometry\r\nupon which this depends? The measured distance _A B_ in the surveyor's\r\nproblem is called a base line.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 3.--With a foot rule and a protractor measure a base line and\r\nthe angles necessary to determine the length of the schoolroom. After\r\nthe length has been thus found, measure it directly with the foot rule\r\nand compare the measured length with the one found from the angles. If\r\nany part of the work has been carelessly done, the student need not\r\nexpect the results to agree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Finding the moon's distance from the earth.]\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, by sighting at the moon from widely different parts\r\nof the earth, as in Fig. 3, the moon's distance from us is found to be\r\nabout a quarter of a million miles. What is the base line in this case?\r\n\r\n4. THE HORIZON--ALTITUDES.--In their observations astronomers and\r\nsailors make much use of the _plane of the horizon_, and practically any\r\nflat and level surface, such as that of a smooth pond, may be regarded\r\nas a part of this plane and used as such. A very common observation\r\nrelating to the plane of the horizon is called \"taking the sun's\r\naltitude,\" and consists in measuring the angle between the sun's rays\r\nand the plane of the horizon upon which they fall. This angle between a\r\nline and a plane appears slightly different from the angle between two\r\nlines, but is really the same thing, since it means the angle between\r\nthe sun's rays and a line drawn in the plane of the horizon toward the\r\npoint directly under the sun. Compare this with the definition given in\r\nthe geographies, \"The latitude of a point on the earth's surface is its\r\nangular distance north or south of the equator,\" and note that the\r\nlatitude is the angle between the plane of the equator and a line drawn\r\nfrom the earth's center to the given point on its surface.\r\n\r\nA convenient method of obtaining a part of the plane of the horizon for\r\nuse in observation is as follows: Place a slate or a pane of glass upon\r\na table in the sunshine. Slightly moisten its whole surface and then\r\npour a little more water upon it near the center. If the water runs\r\ntoward one side, thrust the edge of a thin wooden wedge under this side\r\nand block it up until the water shows no tendency to run one way rather\r\nthan another; it is then level and a part of the plane of the horizon.\r\nGet several wedges ready before commencing the experiment. After they\r\nhave been properly placed, drive a pin or tack behind each one so that\r\nit may not slip.\r\n\r\n5. TAKING THE SUN'S ALTITUDE. EXERCISE 4.--Prepare a piece of board 20\r\ncentimeters, or more, square, planed smooth on one face and one edge.\r\nDrive a pin perpendicularly into the face of the board, near the middle\r\nof the planed edge. Set the board on edge on the horizon plane and turn\r\nit edgewise toward the sun so that a shadow of the pin is cast on the\r\nplane. Stick another pin into the board, near its upper edge, so that\r\nits shadow shall fall exactly upon the shadow of the first pin, and with\r\na watch or clock observe the time at which the two shadows coincide.\r\nWithout lifting the board from the plane, turn it around so that the\r\nopposite edge is directed toward the sun and set a third pin just as the\r\nsecond one was placed, and again take the time. Remove the pins and draw\r\nfine pencil lines, connecting the holes, as shown in Fig. 4, and with\r\nthe protractor measure the angle thus marked. The student who has\r\nstudied elementary geometry should be able to demonstrate that at the\r\nmean of the two recorded times the sun's altitude was equal to one half\r\nof the angle measured in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Taking the sun's altitude.]\r\n\r\nWhen the board is turned edgewise toward the sun so that its shadow is\r\nas thin as possible, rule a pencil line alongside it on the horizon\r\nplane. The angle which this line makes with a line pointing due south is\r\ncalled the sun's _azimuth_. When the sun is south, its azimuth is zero;\r\nwhen west, it is 90°; when east, 270°, etc.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 5.--Let a number of different students take the sun's altitude\r\nduring both the morning and afternoon session and note the time of each\r\nobservation, to the nearest minute. Verify the setting of the plane of\r\nthe horizon from time to time, to make sure that no change has occurred\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n6. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATIONS.--Make a graph (drawing) of all the\r\nobservations, similar to Fig. 5, and find by bisecting a set of chords\r\n_g_ to _g_, _e_ to _e_, _d_ to _d_, drawn parallel to _B B_, the time at\r\nwhich the sun's altitude was greatest. In Fig. 5 we see from the\r\nintersection of _M M_ with _B B_ that this time was 11h. 50m.\r\n\r\nThe method of graphs which is here introduced is of great importance in\r\nphysical science, and the student should carefully observe in Fig. 5\r\nthat the line _B B_ is a scale of times, which may be made long or\r\nshort, provided only the intervals between consecutive hours 9 to 10, 10\r\nto 11, 11 to 12, etc., are equal. The distance of each little circle\r\nfrom _B B_ is taken proportional to the sun's altitude, and may be upon\r\nany desired scale--e. g., a millimeter to a degree--provided the same\r\nscale is used for all observations. Each circle is placed accurately\r\nover that part of the base line which corresponds to the time at which\r\nthe altitude was taken. Square ruled paper is very convenient, although\r\nnot necessary, for such diagrams. It is especially to be noted that from\r\nthe few observations which are represented in the figure a smooth curve\r\nhas been drawn through the circles which represent the sun's altitude,\r\nand this curve shows the altitude of the sun at every moment between 9\r\nA. M. and 3 P. M. In Fig. 5 the sun's altitude at noon was 57°. What was\r\nit at half past two?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--A graph of the sun's altitude.]\r\n\r\n7. DIAMETER OF A DISTANT OBJECT.--By sighting over a protractor, measure\r\nthe angle between imaginary lines drawn from it to the opposite sides of\r\na window. Carry the protractor farther away from the window and repeat\r\nthe experiment, to see how much the angle changes. The angle thus\r\nmeasured is called \"the angle subtended\" by the window at the place\r\nwhere the measurement was made. If this place was squarely in front of\r\nthe window we may draw upon paper an angle equal to the measured one and\r\nlay off from the vertex along its sides a distance proportional to the\r\ndistance of the window--e. g., a millimeter for each centimeter of real\r\ndistance. If a cross line be now drawn connecting the points thus found,\r\nits length will be proportional to the width of the window, and the\r\nwidth may be read off to scale, a centimeter for every millimeter in the\r\nlength of the cross line.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer who measures with an appropriate instrument the angle\r\nsubtended by the moon may in an entirely similar manner find the moon's\r\ndiameter and has, in fact, found it to be 2,163 miles. Can the same\r\nmethod be used to find the diameter of the sun? A planet? The earth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE STARS AND THEIR DIURNAL MOTION\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE STARS.--From the very beginning of his study in astronomy, and as\r\nfrequently as possible, the student should practice watching the stars\r\nby night, to become acquainted with the constellations and their\r\nmovements. As an introduction to this study he may face toward the\r\nnorth, and compare the stars which he sees in that part of the sky with\r\nthe map of the northern heavens, given on Plate I, opposite page 124.\r\nTurn the map around, upside down if necessary, until the stars upon it\r\nmatch the brighter ones in the sky. Note how the stars are grouped in\r\nsuch conspicuous constellations as the Big Dipper (Ursa Major), the\r\nLittle Dipper (Ursa Minor), and Cassiopeia. These three constellations\r\nshould be learned so that they can be recognized at any time.\r\n\r\n_The names of the stars._--Facing the star map is a key which contains\r\nthe names of the more important constellations and the names of the\r\nbrighter stars in their constellations. These names are for the most\r\npart a Greek letter prefixed to the genitive case of the Latin name of\r\nthe constellation. (See the Greek alphabet printed at the end of the\r\nbook.)\r\n\r\n9. MAGNITUDES OF THE STARS.--Nearly nineteen centuries ago St. Paul\r\nnoted that \"one star differeth from another star in glory,\" and no more\r\napt words can be found to mark the difference of brightness which the\r\nstars present. Even prior to St. Paul's day the ancient Greek\r\nastronomers had divided the stars in respect of brightness into six\r\ngroups, which the modern astronomers still use, calling each group a\r\n_magnitude_. Thus a few of the brightest stars are said to be of the\r\nfirst magnitude, the great mass of faint ones which are just visible to\r\nthe unaided eye are said to be of the sixth magnitude, and intermediate\r\ndegrees of brilliancy are represented by the intermediate magnitudes,\r\nsecond, third, fourth, and fifth. The student must not be misled by the\r\nword magnitude. It has no reference to the size of the stars, but only\r\nto their brightness, and on the star maps of this book the larger and\r\nsmaller circles by which the stars are represented indicate only the\r\nbrightness of the stars according to the system of magnitudes. Following\r\nthe indications of these maps, the student should, in learning the\r\nprincipal stars and constellations, learn also to recognize how bright\r\nis a star of the second, fourth, or other magnitude.\r\n\r\n10. OBSERVING THE STARS.--Find on the map and in the sky the stars\r\n[a] Ursæ Minoris, [a] Ursæ Majoris, [b] Ursæ Majoris. What geometrical\r\nfigure will fit on to these stars? In addition to its regular name,\r\n[a] Ursæ Minoris is frequently called by the special name Polaris, or\r\nthe pole star. Why are the other two stars called \"the Pointers\"? What\r\nletter of the alphabet do the five bright stars in Cassiopeia suggest?\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 6.--Stand in such a position that Polaris is just hidden behind\r\nthe corner of a building or some other vertical line, and mark upon the\r\nkey map as accurately as possible the position of this line with respect\r\nto the other stars, showing which stars are to the right and which are\r\nto the left of it. Record the time (date, hour, and minute) at which\r\nthis observation was made. An hour or two later repeat the observation\r\nat the same place, draw the line and note the time, and you will find\r\nthat the line last drawn upon the map does not agree with the first one.\r\nThe stars have changed their positions, and with respect to the vertical\r\nline the Pointers are now in a different direction from Polaris.\r\nMeasure with a protractor the angle between the two lines drawn in the\r\nmap, and use this angle and the recorded times of the observation to\r\nfind how many degrees per hour this direction is changing. It should be\r\nabout 15° per hour. If the observation were repeated 12 hours after the\r\nfirst recorded time, what would be the position of the vertical line\r\namong the stars? What would it be 24 hours later? A week later? Repeat\r\nthe observation on the next clear night, and allowing for the number of\r\nwhole revolutions made by the stars between the two dates, again\r\ndetermine from the time interval a more accurate value of the rate at\r\nwhich the stars move.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the stars which the student has here detected is called\r\ntheir \"diurnal\" motion. What is the significance of the word diurnal?\r\n\r\nIn the preceding paragraph there is introduced a method of great\r\nimportance in astronomical practice--i. e., determining something--in\r\nthis case the rate per hour, from observations separated by a long\r\ninterval of time, in order to get a more accurate value than could be\r\nfound from a short interval. Why is it more accurate? To determine the\r\nrate at which the planet Mars rotates about its axis, astronomers use\r\nobservations separated by an interval of more than 200 years, during\r\nwhich the planet made more than 75,000 revolutions upon its axis. If we\r\nwere to write out in algebraic form an equation for determining the\r\nlength of one revolution of Mars about its axis, the large number,\r\n75,000, would appear in the equation as a divisor, and in the final\r\nresult would greatly reduce whatever errors existed in the observations\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nRepeat Exercise 6 night after night, and note whether the stars come\r\nback to the same position at the same hour and minute every night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. The plumb-line apparatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. The plumb-line apparatus.]\r\n\r\n11. THE PLUMB-LINE APPARATUS.--This experiment, and many others, may be\r\nconveniently and accurately made with no other apparatus than a plumb\r\nline, and a device for sighting past it. In Figs. 6 and 7 there is\r\nshown a simple form of such apparatus, consisting essentially of a board\r\nwhich rests in a horizontal position upon the points of three screws\r\nthat pass through it. This board carries a small box, to one side of\r\nwhich is nailed in vertical position another board 5 or 6 feet long to\r\ncarry the plumb line. This consists of a wire or fish line with any\r\nheavy weight--e. g., a brick or flatiron--tied to its lower end and\r\nimmersed in a vessel of water placed inside the box, so as to check any\r\nswinging motion of the weight. In the cover of the box is a small hole\r\nthrough which the wire passes, and by turning the screws in the\r\nbaseboard the apparatus may be readily leveled, so that the wire shall\r\nswing freely in the center of the hole without touching the cover of the\r\nbox. Guy wires, shown in the figure, are applied so as to stiffen the\r\nwhole apparatus. A board with a screw eye at each end may be pivoted to\r\nthe upright, as in Fig. 6, for measuring altitudes; or to the box, as in\r\nFig. 7, for observing the time at which a star in its diurnal motion\r\npasses through the plane determined by the plumb line and the center of\r\nthe screw eye through which the observer looks.\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus may be constructed by any person of ordinary\r\nmechanical skill at a very small cost, and it or something equivalent\r\nshould be provided for every class beginning observational astronomy. To\r\nuse the apparatus for the experiment of § 10, it should be leveled, and\r\nthe board with the screw eyes, attached as in Fig. 7, should be turned\r\nuntil the observer, looking through the screw eye, sees Polaris exactly\r\nbehind the wire. Use a bicycle lamp to illumine the wire by night. The\r\napparatus is now adjusted, and the observer has only to wait for the\r\nstars which he desires to observe, and to note by his watch the time at\r\nwhich they pass behind the wire. It will be seen that the wire takes the\r\nplace of the vertical edge of the building, and that the board with the\r\nscrew eyes is introduced solely to keep the observer in the right place\r\nrelative to the wire.\r\n\r\n12. A SIDEREAL CLOCK.--Clocks are sometimes so made and regulated that\r\nthey show always the same hour and minute when the stars come back to\r\nthe same place, and such a timepiece is called a sidereal clock--i. e.,\r\na star-time clock. Would such a clock gain or lose in comparison with an\r\nordinary watch? Could an ordinary watch be turned into a sidereal watch\r\nby moving the regulator?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Photographing the circumpolar stars.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\n13. PHOTOGRAPHING THE STARS.--EXERCISE 7.--For any student who uses a\r\ncamera. Upon some clear and moonless night point the camera, properly\r\nfocused, at Polaris, and expose a plate for three or four hours. Upon\r\ndeveloping the plate you should find a series of circular trails such as\r\nare shown in Fig. 8, only longer. Each one of these is produced by a\r\nstar moving slowly over the plate, in consequence of its changing\r\nposition in the sky. The center indicated by these curved trails is\r\ncalled the pole of the heavens. It is that part of the sky toward which\r\nis pointed the axis about which the earth rotates, and the motion of the\r\nstars around the center is only an apparent motion due to the rotation\r\nof the earth which daily carries the observer and his camera around this\r\naxis while the stars stand still, just as trees and fences and telegraph\r\npoles stand still, although to the passenger upon a railway train they\r\nappear to be in rapid motion. So far as simple observations are\r\nconcerned, there is no method by which the pupil can tell for himself\r\nthat the motion of the stars is an apparent rather than a real one, and,\r\nfollowing the custom of astronomers, we shall habitually speak as if it\r\nwere a real movement of the stars. How long was the plate exposed in\r\nphotographing Fig. 8?\r\n\r\n14. FINDING THE STARS.--On Plate I, opposite page 124, the pole of the\r\nheavens is at the center of the map, near Polaris, and the heavy trail\r\nnear the center of Fig. 8 is made by Polaris. See if you can identify\r\nfrom the map any of the stars whose trails show in the photograph. The\r\nbrighter the star the bolder and heavier its trail.\r\n\r\nFind from the map and locate in the sky the two bright stars Capella and\r\nVega, which are on opposite sides of Polaris and nearly equidistant from\r\nit. Do these stars share in the motion around the pole? Are they visible\r\non every clear night, and all night?\r\n\r\nObserve other bright stars farther from Polaris than are Vega and\r\nCapella and note their movement. Do they move like the sun and moon? Do\r\nthey rise and set?\r\n\r\nIn what part of the sky do the stars move most rapidly, near the pole or\r\nfar from it?\r\n\r\nHow long does it take the fastest moving stars to make the circuit of\r\nthe sky and come back to the same place? How long does it take the slow\r\nstars?\r\n\r\n15. RISING AND SETTING OF THE STARS.--A study of the sky along the lines\r\nindicated in these questions will show that there is a considerable part\r\nof it surrounding the pole whose stars are visible on every clear night.\r\nThe same star is sometimes high in the sky, sometimes low, sometimes to\r\nthe east of the pole and at other times west of it, but is always above\r\nthe horizon. Such stars are said to be circumpolar. A little farther\r\nfrom the pole each star, when at the lowest point of its circular path,\r\ndips for a time below the horizon and is lost to view, and the farther\r\nit is away from the pole the longer does it remain invisible, until, in\r\nthe case of stars 90° away from the pole, we find them hidden below the\r\nhorizon for twelve hours out of every twenty-four (see Fig. 9). The sun\r\nis such a star, and in its rising and setting acts precisely as does\r\nevery other star at a similar distance from the pole--only, as we shall\r\nfind later, each star keeps always at (nearly) the same distance from\r\nthe pole, while the sun in the course of a year changes its distance\r\nfrom the pole very greatly, and thus changes the amount of time it\r\nspends above and below the horizon, producing in this way the long days\r\nof summer and the short ones of winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diurnal motion of the northern constellations.]\r\n\r\nHow much time do stars which are more than 90° from the pole spend above\r\nthe horizon?\r\n\r\nWe say in common speech that the sun rises in the east, but this is\r\nstrictly true only at the time when it is 90° distant from the\r\npole--i. e., in March and September. At other seasons it rises north or\r\nsouth of east according as its distance from the pole is less or greater\r\nthan 90°, and the same is true for the stars.\r\n\r\n16. THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE SKY.--Find from a map the latitude and\r\nlongitude of your schoolhouse. Find on the map the place whose latitude\r\nis 39° and longitude 77° west of the meridian of Greenwich. Is there any\r\nother place in the world which has the same latitude and longitude as\r\nyour schoolhouse?\r\n\r\nThe places of the stars in the sky are located in exactly the manner\r\nwhich is illustrated by these geographical questions, only different\r\nnames are used. Instead of latitude the astronomer says _declination_,\r\nin place of longitude he says _right ascension_, in place of meridian he\r\nsays _hour circle_, but he means by these new names the same ideas that\r\nthe geographer expresses by the old ones.\r\n\r\nImagine the earth swollen up until it fills the whole sky; the earth's\r\nequator would meet the sky along a line (a great circle) everywhere 90°\r\ndistant from the pole, and this line is called the _celestial equator_.\r\nTrace its position along the middle of the map opposite page 190 and\r\nnotice near what stars it runs. Every meridian of the swollen earth\r\nwould touch the sky along an hour circle--i. e., a great circle passing\r\nthrough the pole and therefore perpendicular to the equator. Note that\r\nin the map one of these hour circles is marked 0. It plays the same part\r\nin measuring right ascensions as does the meridian of Greenwich in\r\nmeasuring longitudes; it is the beginning, from which they are reckoned.\r\nNote also, at the extreme left end of the map, the four bright stars in\r\nthe form of a square, one side of which is parallel and close to the\r\nhour circle, which is marked 0. This is familiarly called the Great\r\nSquare in Pegasus, and may be found high up in the southern sky whenever\r\nthe Big Dipper lies below the pole. Why can it not be seen when Ursa\r\nMajor is above the pole?\r\n\r\nAstronomers use the right ascensions of the stars not only to tell in\r\nwhat part of the sky the star is placed, but also in time reckonings, to\r\nregulate their sidereal clocks, and with regard to this use they find\r\nit convenient to express right ascension not in degrees but in hours,\r\n24 of which fill up the circuit of the sky and each of which is equal\r\nto 15° of arc, 24 × 15 = 360. The right ascension of Capella is\r\n5h. 9m. = 77.2°, but the student should accustom himself to using it\r\nin hours and minutes as given and not to change it into degrees. He\r\nshould also note that some stars lie on the side of the celestial\r\nequator toward Polaris, and others are on the opposite side, so that the\r\nastronomer has to distinguish between north declinations and south\r\ndeclinations, just as the geographer distinguishes between north\r\nlatitudes and south latitudes. This is done by the use of the + and -\r\nsigns, a + denoting that the star lies north of the celestial equator,\r\ni. e., toward Polaris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--From a photograph of the Pleiades.]\r\n\r\nFind on Plate II, opposite page 190, the Pleiades (Pl[=e]ad[=e]s),\r\nR. A. = 3h. 42m., Dec. = +23.8°. Why do they not show on Plate I,\r\nopposite page 124? In what direction are they from Polaris? This is one\r\nof the finest star clusters in the sky, but it needs a telescope to\r\nbring out its richness. See how many stars you can count in it with the\r\nnaked eye, and afterward examine it with an opera glass. Compare what\r\nyou see with Fig. 10. Find Antares, R. A. = 16h. 23m. Dec. = -26.2°. How\r\nfar is it, in degrees, from the pole? Is it visible in your sky? If so,\r\nwhat is its color?\r\n\r\nFind the R. A. and Dec. of [a] Ursæ Majoris; of [b] Ursæ Majoris; of\r\nPolaris. Find the Northern Crown, _Corona Borealis_, R. A. = 15h. 30m.,\r\nDec. = +27.0°; the Beehive, _Præsepe_, R. A. = 8h. 33m., Dec. = +20.4°.\r\n\r\nThese should be looked up, not only on the map, but also in the sky.\r\n\r\n17. REFERENCE LINES AND CIRCLES.--As the stars move across the sky in\r\ntheir diurnal motion, they carry the framework of hour circles and\r\nequator with them, so that the right ascension and declination of each\r\nstar remain unchanged by this motion, just as longitudes and latitudes\r\nremain unchanged by the earth's rotation. They are the same when a star\r\nis rising and when it is setting; when it is above the pole and when it\r\nis below it. During each day the hour circle of every star in the\r\nheavens passes overhead, and at the moment when any particular hour\r\ncircle is exactly overhead all the stars which lie upon it are said to\r\nbe \"on the meridian\"--i. e., at that particular moment they stand\r\ndirectly over the observer's geographical meridian and upon the\r\ncorresponding celestial meridian.\r\n\r\nAn eye placed at the center of the earth and capable of looking through\r\nits solid substance would see your geographical meridian against the\r\nbackground of the sky exactly covering your celestial meridian and\r\npassing from one pole through your zenith to the other pole. In Fig. 11\r\nthe inner circle represents the terrestrial meridian of a certain\r\nplace, _O_, as seen from the center of the earth, _C_, and the outer\r\ncircle represents the celestial meridian of _O_ as seen from _C_, only\r\nwe must imagine, what can not be shown on the figure, that the outer\r\ncircle is so large that the inner one shrinks to a mere point in\r\ncomparison with it. If _C P_ represents the direction in which the\r\nearth's axis passes through the center, then _C E_ at right angles to it\r\nmust be the direction of the equator which we suppose to be turned\r\nedgewise toward us; and if _C O_ is the direction of some particular\r\npoint on the earth's surface, then _Z_ directly overhead is called the\r\n_zenith_ of that point, upon the celestial sphere. The line _C H_\r\nrepresents a direction parallel to the horizon plane at _O_, and _H C P_\r\nis the angle which the axis of the earth makes with this horizon plane.\r\nThe arc _O E_ measures the latitude of _O_, and the arc _Z E_ measures\r\nthe declination of _Z_, and since by elementary geometry each of these\r\narcs contains the same number of degrees as the angle _E C Z_, we have\r\nthe\r\n\r\n_Theorem._--The latitude of any place is equal to the declination of its\r\nzenith.\r\n\r\n_Corollary._--Any star whose declination is equal to your latitude will\r\nonce in each day pass through your zenith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Reference lines and circles.]\r\n\r\n18. LATITUDE.--From the construction of the figure\r\n\r\n    [angle] _E C Z_ + [angle] _Z C P_ = 90°\r\n    [angle] _H C P_ + [angle] _Z C P_ = 90°\r\n\r\nfrom which we find by subtraction and transposition\r\n\r\n    [angle] _E C Z_ = [angle] _H C P_\r\n\r\nand this gives the further\r\n\r\n_Theorem._--The latitude of any place is equal to the elevation of the\r\npole above its horizon plane.\r\n\r\nAn observer who travels north or south over the earth changes his\r\nlatitude, and therefore changes the angle between his horizon plane and\r\nthe axis of the earth. What effect will this have upon the position of\r\nstars in his sky? If you were to go to the earth's equator, in what part\r\nof the sky would you look for Polaris? Can Polaris be seen from\r\nAustralia? From South America? If you were to go from Minnesota to\r\nTexas, in what respect would the appearance of stars in the northern sky\r\nbe changed? How would the appearance of stars in the southern sky be\r\nchanged?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Diurnal path of Polaris.]\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 8.--Determine your latitude by taking the altitude of Polaris\r\nwhen it is at some one of the four points of its diurnal path, shown in\r\nFig. 12. When it is at _1_ it is said to be at upper culmination, and\r\nthe star [z] Ursæ Majoris in the handle of the Big Dipper will be\r\ndirectly below it. When at _2_ it is at western elongation, and the\r\nstar Castor is near the meridian. When it is at _3_ it is at lower\r\nculmination, and the star Spica is on the meridian. When it is at _4_ it\r\nis at eastern elongation, and Altair is near the meridian. All of these\r\nstars are conspicuous ones, which the student should find upon the map\r\nand learn to recognize in the sky. The altitude observed at either _2_\r\nor _4_ may be considered equal to the latitude of the place, but the\r\naltitude observed when Polaris is at the positions marked _1_ and _3_\r\nmust be corrected for the star's distance from the pole, which may be\r\nassumed equal to 1.3°.\r\n\r\nThe plumb-line apparatus described at page 12 is shown in Fig. 6\r\nslightly modified, so as to adapt it to measuring the altitudes of\r\nstars. Note that the board with the screw eye at one end has been\r\ntransferred from the box to the vertical standard, and has a screw eye\r\nat each end. When the apparatus has been properly leveled, so that the\r\nplumb line hangs at the middle of the hole in the box cover, the board\r\nis to be pointed at the star by sighting through the centers of the two\r\nscrew eyes, and a pencil line is to be ruled along its edge upon the\r\nface of the vertical standard. After this has been done turn the\r\napparatus halfway around so that what was the north side now points\r\nsouth, level it again and revolve the board about the screw which holds\r\nit to the vertical standard, until the screw eyes again point to the\r\nstar. Rule another line along the same edge of the board as before and\r\nwith a protractor measure the angle between these lines. Use a bicycle\r\nlamp if you need artificial light for your work. The student who has\r\nstudied plane geometry should be able to prove that one half of the\r\nangle between these lines is equal to the altitude of the star.\r\n\r\nAfter you have determined your latitude from Polaris, compare the result\r\nwith your position as shown upon the best map available. With a little\r\npractice and considerable care the latitude may be thus determined\r\nwithin one tenth of a degree, which is equivalent to about 7 miles. If\r\nyou go 10 miles north or south from your first station you should find\r\nthe pole higher up or lower down in the sky by an amount which can be\r\nmeasured with your apparatus.\r\n\r\n19. THE MERIDIAN LINE.--To establish a true north and south line upon\r\nthe ground, use the apparatus as described at page 13, and when Polaris\r\nis at upper or lower culmination drive into the ground two stakes in\r\nline with the star and the plumb line. Such a meridian line is of great\r\nconvenience in observing the stars and should be laid out and\r\npermanently marked in some convenient open space from which, if\r\npossible, all parts of the sky are visible. June and November are\r\nconvenient months for this exercise, since Polaris then comes to\r\nculmination early in the evening.\r\n\r\n20. TIME.--What is _the time_ at which school begins in the morning?\r\nWhat do you mean by \"_the time_\"?\r\n\r\nThe sidereal time at any moment is the right ascension of the hour\r\ncircle which at that moment coincides with the meridian. When the hour\r\ncircle passing through Sirius coincides with the meridian, the sidereal\r\ntime is 6h. 40m., since that is the right ascension of Sirius, and in\r\nastronomical language Sirius is \"_on the meridian_\" at 6h. 40m. sidereal\r\ntime. As may be seen from the map, this 6h. 40m. is the right ascension\r\nof Sirius, and if a clock be set to indicate 6h. 40m. when Sirius\r\ncrosses the meridian, it will show sidereal time. If the clock is\r\nproperly regulated, every other star in the heavens will come to the\r\nmeridian at the moment when the time shown by the clock is equal to the\r\nright ascension of the star. A clock properly regulated for this purpose\r\nwill gain about four minutes per day in comparison with ordinary clocks,\r\nand when so regulated it is called a sidereal clock. The student should\r\nbe provided with such a clock for his future work, but one such clock\r\nwill serve for several persons, and a nutmeg clock or a watch of the\r\ncheapest kind is quite sufficient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE, MASS.]\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 9.--Set such a clock to sidereal time by means of the transit\r\nof a star over your meridian. For this experiment it is presupposed that\r\na meridian line has been marked out on the ground as in § 19, and the\r\nsimplest mode of performing the experiment required is for the observer,\r\nhaving chosen a suitable star in the southern part of the sky, to place\r\nhis eye accurately over the northern end of the meridian line and to\r\nestimate as nearly as possible the beginning and end of the period\r\nduring which the star appears to stand exactly above the southern end of\r\nthe line. The middle of this period may be taken as the time at which\r\nthe star crossed the meridian and at this moment the sidereal time is\r\nequal to the right ascension of the star. The difference between this\r\nright ascension and the observed middle instant is the error of the\r\nclock or the amount by which its hands must be set back or forward in\r\norder to indicate true sidereal time.\r\n\r\nA more accurate mode of performing the experiment consists in using the\r\nplumb-line apparatus carefully adjusted, as in Fig. 7, so that the line\r\njoining the wire to the center of the screw eye shall be parallel to the\r\nmeridian line. Observe the time by the clock at which the star\r\ndisappears behind the wire as seen through the center of the screw eye.\r\nIf the star is too high up in the sky for convenient observation, place\r\na mirror, face up, just north of the screw eye and observe star, wire\r\nand screw eye by reflection in it.\r\n\r\nThe numerical right ascension of the observed star is needed for this\r\nexperiment, and it may be measured from the star map, but it will\r\nusually be best to observe one of the stars of the table at the end of\r\nthe book, and to obtain its right ascension as follows: The table gives\r\nthe right ascension and declination of each star as they were at the\r\nbeginning of the year 1900, but on account of the precession (see\r\nChapter V), these numbers all change slowly with the lapse of time, and\r\non the average the right ascension of each star of the table must be\r\nincreased by one twentieth of a minute for each year after 1900--i. e.,\r\nin 1910 the right ascension of the first star of the table will be\r\n0h. 38.6m. + (10/20)m. = 0h. 39.1m. The declinations also change\r\nslightly, but as they are only intended to help in finding the star on\r\nthe star maps, their change may be ignored.\r\n\r\nHaving set the clock approximately to sidereal time, observe one or two\r\nmore stars in the same way as above. The difference between the observed\r\ntime and the right ascension, if any is found, is the \"correction\" of\r\nthe clock. This correction ought not to exceed a minute if due care has\r\nbeen taken in the several operations prescribed. The relation of the\r\nclock to the right ascension of the stars is expressed in the following\r\nequation, with which the student should become thoroughly familiar:\r\n\r\n    A = T ± U\r\n\r\n_T_ stands for the time by the clock at which the star crossed the\r\nmeridian. _A_ is the right ascension of the star, and _U_ is the\r\ncorrection of the clock. Use the + sign in the equation whenever the\r\nclock is too slow, and the - sign when it is too fast. _U_ may be found\r\nfrom this equation when _A_ and _T_ are given, or _A_ may be found when\r\n_T_ and _U_ are given. It is in this way that astronomers measure the\r\nright ascensions of the stars and planets.\r\n\r\nDetermine _U_ from each star you have observed, and note how the several\r\nresults agree one with another.\r\n\r\n21. DEFINITIONS.--To define a thing or an idea is to give a description\r\nsufficient to identify it and distinguish it from every other possible\r\nthing or idea. If a definition does not come up to this standard it is\r\ninsufficient. Anything beyond this requirement is certainly useless and\r\nprobably mischievous.\r\n\r\nLet the student define the following geographical terms, and let him\r\nalso criticise the definitions offered by his fellow-students: Equator,\r\npoles, meridian, latitude, longitude, north, south, east, west.\r\n\r\nCompare the following astronomical definitions with your geographical\r\ndefinitions, and criticise them in the same way. If you are not able to\r\nimprove upon them, commit them to memory:\r\n\r\n_The Poles_ of the heavens are those points in the sky toward which the\r\nearth's axis points. How many are there? The one near Polaris is called\r\nthe north pole.\r\n\r\n_The Celestial Equator_ is a great circle of the sky distant 90° from\r\nthe poles.\r\n\r\n_The Zenith_ is that point of the sky, overhead, toward which a plumb\r\nline points. Why is the word overhead placed in the definition? Is there\r\nmore than one zenith?\r\n\r\n_The Horizon_ is a great circle of the sky 90° distant from the zenith.\r\n\r\n_An Hour Circle_ is any great circle of the sky which passes through the\r\npoles. Every star has its own hour circle.\r\n\r\n_The Meridian_ is that hour circle which passes through the zenith.\r\n\r\n_A Vertical Circle_ is any great circle that passes through the zenith.\r\nIs the meridian a vertical circle?\r\n\r\n_The Declination_ of a star is its angular distance north or south of\r\nthe celestial equator.\r\n\r\n_The Right Ascension_ of a star is the angle included between its hour\r\ncircle and the hour circle of a certain point on the equator which is\r\ncalled the _Vernal Equinox_. From spherical geometry we learn that this\r\nangle is to be measured either at the pole where the two hour circles\r\nintersect, as is done in the star map opposite page 124, or along the\r\nequator, as is done in the map opposite page 190. Right ascension is\r\nalways measured from the vernal equinox in the direction opposite to\r\nthat in which the stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e.,\r\nfrom west toward east.\r\n\r\n_The Altitude_ of a star is its angular distance above the horizon.\r\n\r\n_The Azimuth_ of a star is the angle between the meridian and the\r\nvertical circle passing through the star. A star due south has an\r\nazimuth of 0°. Due west, 90°. Due north, 180°. Due east, 270°.\r\n\r\nWhat is the azimuth of Polaris in degrees?\r\n\r\nWhat is the azimuth of the sun at sunrise? At sunset? At noon? Are these\r\nazimuths the same on different days?\r\n\r\n_The Hour Angle_ of a star is the angle between its hour circle and the\r\nmeridian. It is measured from the meridian in the direction in which the\r\nstars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e., from east toward\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nWhat is the hour angle of the sun at noon? What is the hour angle of\r\nPolaris when it is at the lowest point in its daily motion?\r\n\r\n22. EXERCISES.--The student must not be satisfied with merely learning\r\nthese definitions. He must learn to see these points and lines in his\r\nmind as if they were visibly painted upon the sky. To this end it will\r\nhelp him to note that the poles, the zenith, the meridian, the horizon,\r\nand the equator seem to stand still in the sky, always in the same place\r\nwith respect to the observer, while the hour circles and the vernal\r\nequinox move with the stars and keep the same place among them. Does the\r\napparent motion of a star change its declination or right ascension?\r\nWhat is the hour angle of the sun when it has the greatest altitude?\r\nWill your answer to the preceding question be true for a star? What is\r\nthe altitude of the sun after sunset? In what direction is the north\r\npole from the zenith? From the vernal equinox? Where are the points in\r\nwhich the meridian and equator respectively intersect the horizon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFIXED AND WANDERING STARS\r\n\r\n\r\n23. STAR MAPS.--Select from the map some conspicuous constellation that\r\nwill be conveniently placed for observation in the evening, and make on\r\na large scale a copy of all the stars of the constellation that are\r\nshown upon the map. At night compare this copy with the sky, and mark in\r\nupon your paper all the stars of the constellation which are not already\r\nthere. Both the original drawing and the additions made to it by night\r\nshould be carefully done, and for the latter purpose what is called the\r\nmethod of allineations may be used with advantage--i. e., the new star\r\nis in line with two already on the drawing and is midway between them,\r\nor it makes an equilateral triangle with two others, or a square with\r\nthree others, etc.\r\n\r\nA series of maps of the more prominent constellations, such as Ursa\r\nMajor, Cassiopea, Pegasus, Taurus, Orion, Gemini, Canis Major, Leo,\r\nCorvus, Bootes, Virgo, Hercules, Lyra, Aquila, Scorpius, should be\r\nconstructed in this manner upon a uniform scale and preserved as a part\r\nof the student's work. Let the magnitude of the stars be represented on\r\nthe maps as accurately as may be, and note the peculiarity of color\r\nwhich some stars present. For the most part their color is a very pale\r\nyellow, but occasionally one may be found of a decidedly ruddy\r\nhue--e. g., Aldebaran or Antares. Such a star map, not quite complete,\r\nis shown in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nSo, too, a sharp eye may detect that some stars do not remain always of\r\nthe same magnitude, but change their brightness from night to night,\r\nand this not on account of cloud or mist in the atmosphere, but from\r\nsomething in the star itself. Algol is one of the most conspicuous of\r\nthese _variable stars_, as they are called.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Star map of the region about Orion.]\r\n\r\n24. THE MOON'S MOTION AMONG THE STARS.--Whenever the moon is visible\r\nnote its position among the stars by allineations, and plot it on the\r\nkey map opposite page 190. Keep a record of the day and hour\r\ncorresponding to each such observation. You will find, if the work is\r\ncorrectly done, that the positions of the moon all fall near the curved\r\nline shown on the map. This line is called the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nAfter several such observations have been made and plotted, find by\r\nmeasurement from the map how many degrees per day the moon moves. How\r\nlong would it require to make the circuit of the heavens and come back\r\nto the starting point?\r\n\r\nOn each night when you observe the moon, make on a separate piece of\r\npaper a drawing of it about 10 centimeters in diameter and show in the\r\ndrawing every feature of the moon's face which you can see--e. g., the\r\nshape of the illuminated surface (phase); the direction among the stars\r\nof the line joining the horns; any spots which you can see upon the\r\nmoon's face, etc. An opera glass will prove of great assistance in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nUse your drawings and the positions of the moon plotted upon the map to\r\nanswer the following questions: Does the direction of the line joining\r\nthe horns have any special relation to the ecliptic? Does the amount of\r\nilluminated surface of the moon have any relation to the moon's angular\r\ndistance from the sun? Does it have any relation to the time at which\r\nthe moon sets? Do the spots on the moon when visible remain always in\r\nthe same place? Do they come and go? Do they change their position with\r\nrelation to each other? Can you determine from these spots that the moon\r\nrotates about an axis, as the earth does? In what direction does its\r\naxis point? How long does it take to make one revolution about the axis?\r\nIs there any day and night upon the moon?\r\n\r\nEach of these questions can be correctly answered from the student's own\r\nobservations without recourse to any book.\r\n\r\n25. THE SUN AND ITS MOTION.--Examine the face of the sun through a\r\nsmoked glass to see if there is anything there that you can sketch.\r\n\r\nBy day as well as by night the sky is studded with stars, only they can\r\nnot be seen by day on account of the overwhelming glare of sunlight, but\r\nthe position of the sun among the stars may be found quite as\r\naccurately as was that of the moon, by observing from day to day its\r\nright ascension and declination, and this should be practiced at noon on\r\nclear days by different members of the class.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 10.--The right ascension of the sun may be found by observing\r\nwith the sidereal clock the time of its transit over the meridian. Use\r\nthe equation in § 20, and substitute in place of _U_ the value of the\r\nclock correction found from observations of stars on a preceding or\r\nfollowing night. If the clock gains or loses _with respect to sidereal\r\ntime_, take this into account in the value of _U_.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 11.--To determine the sun's declination, measure its altitude\r\nat the time it crosses the meridian. Use either the method of Exercise\r\n4, or that used with Polaris in Exercise 8. The student should be able\r\nto show from Fig. 11 that the declination is equal to the sum of the\r\naltitude and the latitude of the place diminished by 90°, or in an\r\nequation\r\n\r\n    Declination = Altitude + Latitude - 90°.\r\n\r\nIf the declination as found from this equation is a negative number it\r\nindicates that the sun is on the south side of the equator.\r\n\r\nThe right ascension and declination of the sun as observed on each day\r\nshould be plotted on the map and the date, written opposite it. If the\r\nwork has been correctly done, the plotted points should fall upon the\r\ncurved line (ecliptic) which runs lengthwise of the map. This line, in\r\nfact, represents the sun's path among the stars.\r\n\r\nNote that the hours of right ascension increase from 0 up to 24, while\r\nthe numbers on the clock dial go only from 0 to 12, and then repeat 0 to\r\n12 again during the same day. When the sidereal time is 13 hours, 14\r\nhours, etc., the clock will indicate 1 hour, 2 hours, etc., and 12 hours\r\nmust then be added to the time shown on the dial.\r\n\r\nIf observations of the sun's right ascension and declination are made\r\nin the latter part of either March or September the student will find\r\nthat the sun crosses the equator at these times, and he should determine\r\nfrom his observations, as accurately as possible, the date and hour of\r\nthis crossing and the point on the equator at which the sun crosses it.\r\nThese points are called the equinoxes, Vernal Equinox and Autumnal\r\nEquinox for the spring and autumn crossings respectively, and the\r\nstudent will recall that the vernal equinox is the point from which\r\nright ascensions are measured. Its position among the stars is found by\r\nastronomers from observations like those above described, only made with\r\nmuch more elaborate apparatus.\r\n\r\nSimilar observations made in June and December show that the sun's\r\nmidday altitude is about 47° greater in summer than in winter. They show\r\nalso that the sun is as far north of the equator in June as he is south\r\nof it in December, from which it is easily inferred that his path, the\r\necliptic, is inclined to the equator at an angle of 23°.5, one half of\r\n47°. This angle is called the obliquity of the ecliptic. The student may\r\nrecall that in the geographies the torrid zone is said to extend 23°.5\r\non either side of the earth's equator. Is there any connection between\r\nthese limits and the obliquity of the ecliptic? Would it be correct to\r\ndefine the torrid zone as that part of the earth's surface within which\r\nthe sun may at some season of the year pass through the zenith?\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 12.--After a half dozen observations of the sun have been\r\nplotted upon the map, find by measurement the rate, in degrees per day,\r\nat which the sun moves along the ecliptic. How many days will be\r\nrequired for it to move completely around the ecliptic from vernal\r\nequinox back to vernal equinox again? Accurate observations with the\r\nelaborate apparatus used by professional astronomers show that this\r\nperiod, which is called a _tropical year_, is 365 days 5 hours 48\r\nminutes 46 seconds. Is this the same as the ordinary year of our\r\ncalendars?\r\n\r\n26. THE PLANETS.--Any one who has watched the sky and who has made the\r\ndrawings prescribed in this chapter can hardly fail to have found in the\r\ncourse of his observations some bright stars not set down on the printed\r\nstar maps, and to have found also that these stars do not remain fixed\r\nin position among their fellows, but wander about from one constellation\r\nto another. Observe the motion of one of these planets from night to\r\nnight and plot its positions on the star map, precisely as was done for\r\nthe moon. What kind of path does it follow?\r\n\r\nBoth the ancient Greeks and the modern Germans have called these bodies\r\nwandering stars, and in English we name them planets, which is simply\r\nthe Greek word for wanderer, bent to our use. Besides the sun and moon\r\nthere are in the heavens five planets easily visible to the naked eye\r\nand, as we shall see later, a great number of smaller ones visible only\r\nin the telescope. More than 2,000 years ago astronomers began observing\r\nthe motion of sun, moon, and planets among the stars, and endeavored to\r\naccount for these motions by the theory that each wandering star moved\r\nin an orbit about the earth. Classical and mediæval literature are\r\npermeated with this idea, which was displaced only after a long struggle\r\nbegun by Copernicus (1543 A. D.), who taught that the moon alone of\r\nthese bodies revolves about the earth, while the earth and the other\r\nplanets revolve around the sun. The ecliptic is the intersection of the\r\nplane of the earth's orbit with the sky, and the sun appears to move\r\nalong the ecliptic because, as the earth moves around its orbit, the sun\r\nis always seen projected against the opposite side of it. The moon and\r\nplanets all appear to move near the ecliptic because the planes of their\r\norbits nearly coincide with the plane of the earth's orbit, and a narrow\r\nstrip on either side of the ecliptic, following its course completely\r\naround the sky, is called the _zodiac_, a word which may be regarded as\r\nthe name of a narrow street (16° wide) within which all the wanderings\r\nof the visible planets are confined and outside of which they never\r\nventure. Indeed, Mars is the only planet which ever approaches the edge\r\nof the street, the others traveling near the middle of the road.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--The apparent motion of a planet.]\r\n\r\n27. A TYPICAL CASE OF PLANETARY MOTION.--The Copernican theory,\r\nenormously extended and developed through the Newtonian law of\r\ngravitation (see Chapter IV), has completely supplanted the older\r\nPtolemaic doctrine, and an illustration of the simple manner in which it\r\naccounts for the apparently complicated motions of a planet among the\r\nstars is found in Figs. 14 and 15, the first of which represents the\r\napparent motion of the planet Mars through the constellations Aries and\r\nPisces during the latter part of the year 1894, while the second shows\r\nthe true motions of Mars and the earth in their orbits about the sun\r\nduring the same period. The straight line in Fig. 14, with cross ruling\r\nupon it, is a part of the ecliptic, and the numbers placed opposite it\r\nrepresent the distance, in degrees, from the vernal equinox. In Fig. 15\r\nthe straight line represents the direction from the sun toward the\r\nvernal equinox, and the angle which this line makes with the line\r\njoining earth and sun is called the earth's longitude. The imaginary\r\nline joining the earth and sun is called the earth's radius vector, and\r\nthe pupil should note that the longitude and length of the radius vector\r\ntaken together show the direction and distance of the earth from the\r\nsun--i. e., they fix the relative positions of the two bodies. The same\r\nis nearly true for Mars and would be wholly true if the orbit of Mars\r\nlay in the same plane with that of the earth. How does Fig. 14 show that\r\nthe orbit of Mars does not lie exactly in the same plane with the orbit\r\nof the earth?\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 13.--Find from Fig. 15 what ought to have been the apparent\r\ncourse of Mars among the stars during the period shown in the two\r\nfigures, and compare what you find with Fig. 14. The apparent position\r\nof Mars among the stars is merely its direction from the earth, and this\r\ndirection is represented in Fig. 14 by the distance of the planet from\r\nthe ecliptic and by its longitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--The real motion of a planet.]\r\n\r\nThe longitude of Mars for each date can be found from Fig. 15 by\r\nmeasuring the angle between the straight line _S V_ and the line drawn\r\nfrom the earth to Mars. Thus for October 12th we may find with the\r\nprotractor that the angle between the line _S V_ and the line joining\r\nthe earth to Mars is a little more than 30°, and in Fig. 14 the position\r\nof Mars for this date is shown nearly opposite the cross line\r\ncorresponding to 30° on the ecliptic. Just how far below the ecliptic\r\nthis position of Mars should fall can not be told from Fig. 15, which\r\nfrom necessity is constructed as if the orbits of Mars and the earth lay\r\nin the same plane, and Mars in this case would always appear to stand\r\nexactly on the ecliptic and to oscillate back and forth as shown in Fig.\r\n14, but without the up-and-down motion there shown. In this way plot in\r\nFig. 14 the longitudes of Mars as seen from the earth for other dates\r\nand observe how the forward motion of the two planets in their orbits\r\naccounts for the apparently capricious motion of Mars to and fro among\r\nthe stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.]\r\n\r\n28. THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS.--Each planet, great or small, moves in\r\nits own appropriate orbit about the sun, and the exact determination of\r\nthese orbits, their sizes, shapes, positions, etc., has been one of the\r\ngreat problems of astronomy for more than 2,000 years, in which\r\nsuccessive generations of astronomers have striven to push to a still\r\nhigher degree of accuracy the knowledge attained by their predecessors.\r\nWithout attempting to enter into the details of this problem we may say,\r\ngenerally, that every planet moves in a plane passing through the sun,\r\nand for the six planets visible to the naked eye these planes nearly\r\ncoincide, so that the six orbits may all be shown without much error as\r\nlying in the flat surface of one map. It is, however, more convenient to\r\nuse two maps, such as Figs. 16 and 17, one of which shows the group of\r\nplanets, Mercury, Venus, the earth, and Mars, which are near the sun,\r\nand on this account are sometimes called the inner planets, while the\r\nother shows the more distant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, together with\r\nthe earth, whose orbit is thus made to serve as a connecting link\r\nbetween the two diagrams. These diagrams are accurately drawn to scale,\r\nand are intended to be used by the student for accurate measurement in\r\nconnection with the exercises and problems which follow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the six planets shown in the figures the solar system\r\ncontains two large planets and several hundred small ones, for the most\r\npart invisible to the naked eye, which are omitted in order to avoid\r\nconfusing the diagrams.\r\n\r\n29. JUPITER AND SATURN.--In Fig. 16 the sun at the center is encircled\r\nby the orbits of the three planets, and inclosing all of these is a\r\ncircular border showing the directions from the sun of the\r\nconstellations which lie along the zodiac. The student must note\r\ncarefully that it is only the directions of these constellations that\r\nare correctly shown, and that in order to show them at all they have\r\nbeen placed very much too close to the sun. The cross lines extending\r\nfrom the orbit of the earth toward the sun with Roman numerals opposite\r\nthem show the positions of the earth in its orbit on the first day of\r\nJanuary (_I_), first day of February (_II_), etc., and the similar lines\r\nattached to the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn with Arabic numerals show\r\nthe positions of those planets on the first day of January of each year\r\nindicated, so that the figure serves to show not only the orbits of the\r\nplanets, but their actual positions in their orbits for something more\r\nthan the first decade of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe line drawn from the sun toward the right of the figure shows the\r\ndirection to the vernal equinox. It forms one side of the angle which\r\nmeasures a planet's longitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--The orbits of the inner planets.]\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 14.--Measure with your protractor the longitude of the earth on\r\nJanuary 1st. Is this longitude the same in all years? Measure the\r\nlongitude of Jupiter on January 1, 1900; on July 1, 1900; on September\r\n25, 1906.\r\n\r\nDraw neatly on the map a pencil line connecting the position of the\r\nearth for January 1, 1900, with the position of Jupiter for the same\r\ndate, and produce the line beyond Jupiter until it meets the circle of\r\nthe constellations. This line represents the direction of Jupiter from\r\nthe earth, and points toward the constellation in which the planet\r\nappears at that date. But this representation of the place of Jupiter in\r\nthe sky is not a very accurate one, since on the scale of the diagram\r\nthe stars are in fact more than 100,000 times as far off as they are\r\nshown in the figure, and the pencil mark does not meet the line of\r\nconstellations at the same intersection it would have if this line were\r\npushed back to its true position. To remedy this defect we must draw\r\nanother line from the sun parallel to the one first drawn, and its\r\nintersection with the constellations will give very approximately the\r\ntrue position of Jupiter in the sky.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 15.--Find the present positions of Jupiter and Saturn, and look\r\nthem up in the sky by means of your star maps. The planets will appear\r\nin the indicated constellations as very bright stars not shown on the\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nWhich of the planets, Jupiter and Saturn, changes its direction from the\r\nsun more rapidly? Which travels the greater number of miles per day?\r\nWhen will Jupiter and Saturn be in the same constellation? Does the\r\nearth move faster or slower than Jupiter?\r\n\r\nThe distance of Jupiter or Saturn from the earth at any time may be\r\nreadily obtained from the figure. Thus, by direct measurement with the\r\nmillimeter scale we find for January 1, 1900, the distance of Jupiter\r\nfrom the earth is 6.1 times the distance of the sun from the earth, and\r\nthis may be turned into miles by multiplying it by 93,000,000, which is\r\napproximately the distance of the sun from the earth. For most purposes\r\nit is quite as well to dispense with this multiplication and call the\r\ndistance 6.1 astronomical units, remembering that the astronomical unit\r\nis the distance of the sun from the earth.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 16.--What is Jupiter's distance from the earth at its nearest\r\napproach? What is the greatest distance it ever attains? Is Jupiter's\r\nleast distance from the earth greater or less than its least distance\r\nfrom Saturn?\r\n\r\nOn what day in the year 1906 will the earth be on line between Jupiter\r\nand the sun? On this day Jupiter is said to be in _opposition_--i. e.,\r\nthe planet and the sun are on opposite sides of the earth, and Jupiter\r\nthen comes to the meridian of any and every place at midnight. When the\r\nsun is between the earth and Jupiter (at what date in 1906?) the planet\r\nis said to be in _conjunction_ with the sun, and of course passes the\r\nmeridian with the sun at noon. Can you determine from the figure the\r\ntime at which Jupiter comes to the meridian at other dates than\r\nopposition and conjunction? Can you determine when it is visible in the\r\nevening hours? Tell from the figure what constellation is on the\r\nmeridian at midnight on January 1st. Will it be the same constellation\r\nin every year?\r\n\r\n\r\n30. MERCURY, VENUS, AND MARS.--Fig. 17, which represents the orbits of\r\nthe inner planets, differs from Fig. 16 only in the method of fixing the\r\npositions of the planets in their orbits at any given date. The motion\r\nof these planets is so rapid, on account of their proximity to the sun,\r\nthat it would not do to mark their positions as was done for Jupiter and\r\nSaturn, and with the exception of the earth they do not always return to\r\nthe same place on the same day in each year. It is therefore necessary\r\nto adopt a slightly different method, as follows: The straight line\r\nextending from the sun toward the vernal equinox, _V_, is called the\r\nprime radius, and we know from past observations that the earth in its\r\nmotion around the sun crosses this line on September 23d in each year,\r\nand to fix the earth's position for September 23d in the diagram we have\r\nonly to take the point at which the prime radius intersects the earth's\r\norbit. A month later, on October 23d, the earth will no longer be at\r\nthis point, but will have moved on along its orbit to the point marked\r\n30 (thirty days after September 23d). Sixty days after September 23d it\r\nwill be at the point marked 60, etc., and for any date we have only to\r\nfind the number of days intervening between it and the preceding\r\nSeptember 23d, and this number will show at once the position of the\r\nearth in its orbit. Thus for the date July 4, 1900, we find\r\n\r\n    1900, July 4 - 1899, September 23 = 284 days,\r\n\r\nand the little circle marked upon the earth's orbit between the numbers\r\n270 and 300 shows the position of the earth on that date.\r\n\r\nIn what constellation was the sun on July 4, 1900? What zodiacal\r\nconstellation came to the meridian at midnight on that date? What other\r\nconstellations came to the meridian at the same time?\r\n\r\nThe positions of the other planets in their orbits are found in the same\r\nmanner, save that they do not cross the prime radius on the same date in\r\neach year, and the times at which they do cross it must be taken from\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\n                      TABLE OF EPOCHS\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n    A.

The following lines of the table show for\r\neach year the date at which each planet first crossed the prime radius\r\nin that year; the dates of subsequent crossings in any year can be found\r\nby adding once, twice, or three times the period to the given date, and\r\nthe table may be extended to later years, if need be, by continuously\r\nadding multiples of the period. In the case of Mars it appears that\r\nthere is only about one year out of two in which this planet crosses the\r\nprime radius.\r\n\r\nAfter the date at which the planet crosses the prime radius has been\r\ndetermined its position for any required date is found exactly as in the\r\ncase of the earth, and the constellation in which the planet will appear\r\nfrom the earth is found as explained above in connection with Jupiter\r\nand Saturn.\r\n\r\nThe broken lines in the figure represent the construction for finding\r\nthe places in the sky occupied by Mercury, Venus, and Mars on July 4,\r\n1900. Let the student make a similar construction and find the positions\r\nof these planets at the present time. Look them up in the sky and see if\r\nthey are where your work puts them.\r\n\r\n31. EXERCISES.--The \"evening star\" is a term loosely applied to any\r\nplanet which is visible in the western sky soon after sunset. It is easy\r\nto see that such a planet must be farther toward the east in the sky\r\nthan is the sun, and in either Fig. 16 or Fig. 17 any planet which\r\nviewed from the position of the earth lies to the left of the sun and\r\nnot more than 50° away from it will be an evening star. If to the right\r\nof the sun it is a morning star, and may be seen in the eastern sky\r\nshortly before sunrise.\r\n\r\nWhat planet is the evening star _now_? Is there more than one evening\r\nstar at a time? What is the morning star now?\r\n\r\nDo Mercury, Venus, or Mars ever appear in opposition? What is the\r\nmaximum angular distance from the sun at which Venus can ever be seen?\r\nWhy is Mercury a more difficult planet to see than Venus? In what month\r\nof the year does Mars come nearest to the earth? Will it always be\r\nbrighter in this month than in any other? Which of all the planets comes\r\nnearest to the earth?\r\n\r\nThe earth always comes to the same longitude on the same day of each\r\nyear. Why is not this true of the other planets?\r\n\r\nThe student should remember that in one respect Figs. 16 and 17 are not\r\naltogether correct representations, since they show the orbits as all\r\nlying in the same plane. If this were strictly true, every planet would\r\nmove, like the sun, always along the ecliptic; but in fact all of the\r\norbits are tilted a little out of the plane of the ecliptic and every\r\nplanet in its motion deviates a little from the ecliptic, first to one\r\nside then to the other; but not even Mars, which is the most erratic in\r\nthis respect, ever gets more than eight degrees away from the ecliptic,\r\nand for the most part all of them are much closer to the ecliptic than\r\nthis limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCELESTIAL MECHANICS\r\n\r\n\r\n32. THE BEGINNINGS OF CELESTIAL MECHANICS.--From the earliest dawn of\r\ncivilization, long before the beginnings of written history, the motions\r\nof sun and moon and planets among the stars from constellation to\r\nconstellation had commanded the attention of thinking men, particularly\r\nof the class of priests. The religions of which they were the guardians\r\nand teachers stood in closest relations with the movements of the stars,\r\nand their own power and influence were increased by a knowledge of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISAAC NEWTON (1643-1727).]\r\n\r\nOut of these professional needs, as well as from a spirit of scientific\r\nresearch, there grew up and flourished for many centuries a study of the\r\nmotions of the planets, simple and crude at first, because the\r\nobservations that could then be made were at best but rough ones, but\r\ngrowing more accurate and more complex as the development of the\r\nmechanic arts put better and more precise instruments into the hands of\r\nastronomers and enabled them to observe with increasing accuracy the\r\nmovements of these bodies. It was early seen that while for the most\r\npart the planets, including the sun and moon, traveled through the\r\nconstellations from west to east, some of them sometimes reversed their\r\nmotion and for a time traveled in the opposite way. This clearly can not\r\nbe explained by the simple theory which had early been adopted that a\r\nplanet moves always in the same direction around a circular orbit having\r\nthe earth at its center, and so it was said to move around in a small\r\ncircular orbit, called an epicycle, whose center was situated upon\r\nand moved along a circular orbit, called the deferent, within which the\r\nearth was placed, as is shown in Fig. 18, where the small circle is the\r\nepicycle, the large circle is the deferent, _P_ is the planet, and _E_\r\nthe earth. When this proved inadequate to account for the really\r\ncomplicated movements of the planets, another epicycle was put on top of\r\nthe first one, and then another and another, until the supposed system\r\nbecame so complicated that Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, repudiated\r\nits fundamental theorem and taught that the motions of the planets take\r\nplace in circles around the sun instead of about the earth, and that the\r\nearth itself is only one of the planets moving around the sun in its own\r\nappropriate orbit and itself largely responsible for the seemingly\r\nerratic movements of the other planets, since from day to day we see\r\nthem and observe their positions from different points of view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Epicycle and deferent.]\r\n\r\n33. KEPLER'S LAWS.--Two generations later came Kepler with his three\r\nfamous laws of planetary motion:\r\n\r\nI. Every planet moves in an ellipse which has the sun at one of its\r\nfoci.\r\n\r\nII. The radius vector of each planet moves over equal areas in equal\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIII. The squares of the periodic times of the planets are proportional\r\nto the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.\r\n\r\nThese laws are the crowning glory, not only of Kepler's career, but of\r\nall astronomical discovery from the beginning up to his time, and they\r\nwell deserve careful study and explanation, although more modern\r\nprogress has shown that they are only approximately true.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 17.--Drive two pins into a smooth board an inch apart and\r\nfasten to them the ends of a string a foot long. Take up the slack of\r\nthe string with the point of a lead pencil and, keeping the string drawn\r\ntaut, move the pencil point over the board into every possible position.\r\nThe curve thus traced will be an ellipse having the pins at the two\r\npoints which are called its foci.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the planetary orbits one focus of the ellipse is vacant,\r\nand, in accordance with the first law, the center of the sun is at the\r\nother focus. In Fig. 17 the dot, inside the orbit of Mercury, which is\r\nmarked _a_, shows the position of the vacant focus of the orbit of Mars,\r\nand the dot _b_ is the vacant focus of Mercury's orbit. The orbits of\r\nVenus and the earth are so nearly circular that their vacant foci lie\r\nvery close to the sun and are not marked in the figure. The line drawn\r\nfrom the sun to any point of the orbit (the string from pin to pencil\r\npoint) is a _radius vector_. The point midway between the pins is the\r\n_center_ of the ellipse, and the distance of either pin from the center\r\nmeasures the _eccentricity_ of the ellipse.\r\n\r\nDraw several ellipses with the same length of string, but with the pins\r\nat different distances apart, and note that the greater the eccentricity\r\nthe flatter is the ellipse, but that all of them have the same length.\r\n\r\nIf both pins were driven into the same hole, what kind of an ellipse\r\nwould you get?\r\n\r\nThe Second Law was worked out by Kepler as his answer to a problem\r\nsuggested by the first law. In Fig. 17 it is apparent from a mere\r\ninspection of the orbit of Mercury that this planet travels much faster\r\non one side of its orbit than on the other, the distance covered in ten\r\ndays between the numbers 10 and 20 being more than fifty per cent\r\ngreater than that between 50 and 60. The same difference is found,\r\nthough usually in less degree, for every other planet, and Kepler's\r\nproblem was to discover a means by which to mark upon the orbit the\r\nfigures showing the positions of the planet at the end of equal\r\nintervals of time. His solution of this problem, contained in the second\r\nlaw, asserts that if we draw radii vectors from the sun to each of the\r\nmarked points taken at equal time intervals around the orbit, then the\r\narea of the sector formed by two adjacent radii vectores and the arc\r\nincluded between them is equal to the area of each and every other such\r\nsector, the short radii vectores being spread apart so as to include a\r\nlong arc between them while the long radii vectores have a short arc. In\r\nKepler's form of stating the law the radius vector is supposed to travel\r\nwith the planet and in each day to sweep over the same fractional part\r\nof the total area of the orbit. The spacing of the numbers in Fig. 17\r\nwas done by means of this law.\r\n\r\nFor the proper understanding of Kepler's Third Law we must note that the\r\n\"mean distance\" which appears in it is one half of the long diameter of\r\nthe orbit and that the \"periodic time\" means the number of days or years\r\nrequired by the planet to make a complete circuit in its orbit.\r\nRepresenting the first of these by _a_ and the second by _T_, we have,\r\nas the mathematical equivalent of the law,\r\n\r\n    a^{3} ÷ T^{2} = C\r\n\r\nwhere the quotient, _C_, is a number which, as Kepler found, is the same\r\nfor every planet of the solar system. If we take the mean distance of\r\nthe earth from the sun as the unit of distance, and the year as the unit\r\nof time, we shall find by applying the equation to the earth's motion,\r\n_C_ = 1. Applying this value to any other planet we shall find in the\r\nsame units, _a_ = _T_^{2/3}, by means of which we may determine the\r\ndistance of any planet from the sun when its periodic time, _T_, has\r\nbeen learned from observation.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 18.--Uranus requires 84 years to make a revolution in its\r\norbit. What is its mean distance from the sun? What are the mean\r\ndistances of Mercury, Venus, and Mars? (See Chapter III for their\r\nperiodic times.) Would it be possible for two planets at different\r\ndistances from the sun to move around their orbits in the same time?\r\n\r\nA circle is an ellipse in which the two foci have been brought together.\r\nWould Kepler's laws hold true for such an orbit?\r\n\r\n34. NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION.--Kepler studied and described the motion of\r\nthe planets. Newton, three generations later (1727 A. D.), studied and\r\ndescribed the mechanism which controls that motion. To Kepler and his\r\nage the heavens were supernatural, while to Newton and his successors\r\nthey are a part of Nature, governed by the same laws which obtain upon\r\nthe earth, and we turn to the ordinary things of everyday life as the\r\nfoundation of celestial mechanics.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has ridden a bicycle knows that he can coast farther upon\r\na level road if it is smooth than if it is rough; but however smooth and\r\nhard the road may be and however fast the wheel may have been started,\r\nit is sooner or later stopped by the resistance which the road and the\r\nair offer to its motion, and when once stopped or checked it can be\r\nstarted again only by applying fresh power. We have here a familiar\r\nillustration of what is called\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST LAW OF MOTION.--\"Every body continues in its state of rest or\r\nof uniform motion in a straight line except in so far as it may be\r\ncompelled by force to change that state.\" A gust of wind, a stone, a\r\ncareless movement of the rider may turn the bicycle to the right or the\r\nleft, but unless some disturbing force is applied it will go straight\r\nahead, and if all resistance to its motion could be removed it would go\r\nalways at the speed given it by the last power applied, swerving neither\r\nto the one hand nor the other.\r\n\r\nWhen a slow rider increases his speed we recognize at once that he has\r\napplied additional power to the wheel, and when this speed is slackened\r\nit equally shows that force has been applied against the motion. It is\r\nforce alone which can produce a change in either velocity or direction\r\nof motion; but simple as this law now appears it required the genius of\r\nGalileo to discover it and of Newton to give it the form in which it is\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n35. THE SECOND LAW OF MOTION, which is also due to Galileo and Newton,\r\nis:\r\n\r\n\"Change of motion is proportional to force applied and takes place in\r\nthe direction of the straight line in which the force acts.\" Suppose a\r\nman to fall from a balloon at some great elevation in the air; his own\r\nweight is the force which pulls him down, and that force operating at\r\nevery instant is sufficient to give him at the end of the first second\r\nof his fall a downward velocity of 32 feet per second--i. e., it has\r\nchanged his state from rest, to motion at this rate, and the motion is\r\ntoward the earth because the force acts in that direction. During the\r\nnext second the ceaseless operation of this force will have the same\r\neffect as in the first second and will add another 32 feet to his\r\nvelocity, so that two seconds from the time he commenced to fall he will\r\nbe moving at the rate of 64 feet per second, etc. The column of figures\r\nmarked _v_ in the table below shows what his velocity will be at the end\r\nof subsequent seconds. The changing velocity here shown is the change of\r\nmotion to which the law refers, and the velocity is proportional to the\r\ntime shown in the first column of the table, because the amount of force\r\nexerted in this case is proportional to the time during which it\r\noperated. The distance through which the man will fall in each second is\r\nshown in the column marked _d_, and is found by taking the average of\r\nhis velocity at the beginning and end of this second, and the total\r\ndistance through which he has fallen at the end of each second, marked\r\n_s_ in the table, is found by taking the sum of all the preceding values\r\nof _d_. The velocity, 32 feet per second, which measures the change of\r\nmotion in each second, also measures the _accelerating force_ which\r\nproduces this motion, and it is usually represented in formulæ by the\r\nletter _g_. Let the student show from the numbers in the table that the\r\naccelerating force, the time, _t_, during which it operates, and the\r\nspace, _s_, fallen through, satisfy the relation\r\n\r\n    s = 1/2 gt^{2},\r\n\r\nwhich is usually called the law of falling bodies. How does the table\r\nshow that _g_ is equal to 32?\r\n\r\n            TABLE\r\n\r\n    _t_   _v_   _d_   _s_\r\n\r\n     0      0     0     0\r\n     1     32    16    16\r\n     2     64    48    64\r\n     3     96    80   144\r\n     4    128   112   256\r\n     5    160   144   400\r\n    etc.  etc.  etc.  etc.\r\n\r\nIf the balloon were half a mile high how long would it take to fall to\r\nthe ground? What would be the velocity just before reaching the ground?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALILEO GALILEI (1564-1642).]\r\n\r\nFig. 19 shows the path through the air of a ball which has been struck\r\nby a bat at the point _A_, and started off in the direction _A B_ with a\r\nvelocity of 200 feet per second. In accordance with the first law of\r\nmotion, if it were acted upon by no other force than the impulse given\r\nby the bat, it should travel along the straight line _A B_ at the\r\nuniform rate of 200 feet per second, and at the end of the fourth second\r\nit should be 800 feet from _A_, at the point marked 4, but during these\r\nfour seconds its weight has caused it to fall 256 feet, and its actual\r\nposition, 4', is 256 feet below the point 4. In this way we find its\r\nposition at the end of each second, 1', 2', 3', 4', etc., and drawing a\r\nline through these points we shall find the actual path of the ball\r\nunder the influence of the two forces to be the curved line _A C_. No\r\nmatter how far the ball may go before striking the ground, it can not\r\nget back to the point _A_, and the curve _A C_ therefore can not be a\r\npart of a circle, since that curve returns into itself. It is, in fact,\r\na part of a _parabola_, which, as we shall see later, is a kind of orbit\r\nin which comets and some other heavenly bodies move. A skyrocket moves\r\nin the same kind of a path, and so does a stone, a bullet, or any other\r\nobject hurled through the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--The path of a ball.]\r\n\r\n36. THE THIRD LAW OF MOTION.--\"To every action there is always an equal\r\nand contrary reaction; or the mutual actions of any two bodies are\r\nalways equal and oppositely directed.\" This is well illustrated in the\r\ncase of a man climbing a rope hand over hand. The direct force or action\r\nwhich he exerts is a downward pull upon the rope, and it is the reaction\r\nof the rope to this pull which lifts him along it. We shall find in a\r\nlater chapter a curious application of this law to the history of the\r\nearth and moon.\r\n\r\nIt is the great glory of Sir Isaac Newton that he first of all men\r\nrecognized that these simple laws of motion hold true in the heavens as\r\nwell as upon the earth; that the complicated motion of a planet, a\r\ncomet, or a star is determined in accordance with these laws by the\r\nforces which act upon the bodies, and that these forces are essentially\r\nthe same as that which we call weight. The formal statement of the\r\nprinciple last named is included in--\r\n\r\n37. NEWTON'S LAW OF GRAVITATION.--\"Every particle of matter in the\r\nuniverse attracts every other particle with a force whose direction is\r\nthat of a line joining the two, and whose magnitude is directly as the\r\nproduct of their masses, and inversely as the square of their distance\r\nfrom each other.\" We know that we ourselves and the things about us are\r\npulled toward the earth by a force (weight) which is called, in the\r\nLatin that Newton wrote, _gravitas_, and the word marks well the true\r\nsignificance of the law of gravitation. Newton did not discover a new\r\nforce in the heavens, but he extended an old and familiar one from a\r\nlimited terrestrial sphere of action to an unlimited and celestial one,\r\nand furnished a precise statement of the way in which the force\r\noperates. Whether a body be hot or cold, wet or dry, solid, liquid, or\r\ngaseous, is of no account in determining the force which it exerts,\r\nsince this depends solely upon mass and distance.\r\n\r\nThe student should perhaps be warned against straining too far the\r\nlanguage which it is customary to employ in this connection. The law of\r\ngravitation is certainly a far-reaching one, and it may operate in every\r\nremotest corner of the universe precisely as stated above, but\r\nadditional information about those corners would be welcome to\r\nsupplement our rather scanty stock of knowledge concerning what happens\r\nthere. We may not controvert the words of a popular preacher who says,\r\n\"When I lift my hand I move the stars in Ursa Major,\" but we should not\r\nwish to stand sponsor for them, even though they are justified by a\r\nrigorous interpretation of the Newtonian law.\r\n\r\nThe word _mass_, in the statement of the law of gravitation, means the\r\nquantity of matter contained in the body, and if we represent by the\r\nletters _m´_ and _m´´_ the respective quantities of matter contained in\r\nthe two bodies whose distance from each other is _r_, we shall have, in\r\naccordance with the law of gravitation, the following mathematical\r\nexpression for the force, _F_, which acts between them:\r\n\r\n    F = k {m´m´´/r^{2}}.\r\n\r\nThis equation, which is the general mathematical expression for the law\r\nof gravitation, may be made to yield some curious results. Thus, if we\r\nselect two bullets, each having a mass of 1 gram, and place them so that\r\ntheir centers are 1 centimeter apart, the above expression for the force\r\nexerted between them becomes\r\n\r\n    F = k {(1 × 1)/1^{2}} = k,\r\n\r\nfrom which it appears that the coefficient _k_ is the force exerted\r\nbetween these bodies. This is called the gravitation constant, and it\r\nevidently furnishes a measure of the specific intensity with which one\r\nparticle of matter attracts another. Elaborate experiments which have\r\nbeen made to determine the amount of this force show that it is\r\nsurprisingly small, for in the case of the two bullets whose mass of 1\r\ngram each is supposed to be concentrated into an indefinitely small\r\nspace, gravity would have to operate between them continuously for more\r\nthan forty minutes in order to pull them together, although they were\r\nseparated by only 1 centimeter to start with, and nothing save their own\r\ninertia opposed their movements. It is only when one or both of the\r\nmasses _m´_, _m´´_ are very great that the force of gravity becomes\r\nlarge, and the weight of bodies at the surface of the earth is\r\nconsiderable because of the great quantity of matter which goes to make\r\nup the earth. Many of the heavenly bodies are much more massive than the\r\nearth, as the mathematical astronomers have found by applying the law of\r\ngravitation to determine numerically their masses, or, in more popular\r\nlanguage, to \"weigh\" them.\r\n\r\nThe student should observe that the two terms mass and weight are not\r\nsynonymous; mass is defined above as the quantity of matter contained in\r\na body, while weight is the force with which the earth attracts that\r\nbody, and in accordance with the law of gravitation its weight depends\r\nupon its distance from the center of the earth, while its mass is quite\r\nindependent of its position with respect to the earth.\r\n\r\nBy the third law of motion the earth is pulled toward a falling body\r\njust as strongly as the body is pulled toward the earth--i. e., by a\r\nforce equal to the weight of the body. How much does the earth rise\r\ntoward the body?\r\n\r\n38. THE MOTION OF A PLANET.--In Fig. 20 _S_ represents the sun and _P_ a\r\nplanet or other celestial body, which for the moment is moving along the\r\nstraight line _P 1_. In accordance with the first law of motion it would\r\ncontinue to move along this line with uniform velocity if no external\r\nforce acted upon it; but such a force, the sun's attraction, is acting,\r\nand by virtue of this attraction the body is pulled aside from the line\r\n_P 1_.\r\n\r\nKnowing the velocity and direction of the body's motion and the force\r\nwith which the sun attracts it, the mathematician is able to apply\r\nNewton's laws of motion so as to determine the path of the body, and a\r\nfew of the possible orbits are shown in the figure where the short cross\r\nstroke marks the point of each orbit which is nearest to the sun. This\r\npoint is called the _perihelion_.\r\n\r\nWithout any formal application of mathematics we may readily see that\r\nthe swifter the motion of the body at _P_ the shorter will be the time\r\nduring which it is subjected to the sun's attraction at close range, and\r\ntherefore the force exerted by the sun, and the resulting change of\r\nmotion, will be small, as in the orbits _P 1_ and _P 2_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, _P 5_ and _P 6_ represent orbits in which the\r\nvelocity at _P_ was comparatively small, and the resulting change of\r\nmotion greater than would be possible for a more swiftly moving body.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the orbit if the velocity at _P_ were reduced to nothing\r\nat all?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the effect if the body starting at _P_ moved directly away\r\nfrom _1_?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Different kinds of orbits.]\r\n\r\nThe student should not fail to observe that the sun's attraction tends\r\nto pull the body at _P_ forward along its path, and therefore increases\r\nits velocity, and that this influence continues until the planet reaches\r\nperihelion, at which point it attains its greatest velocity, and the\r\nforce of the sun's attraction is wholly expended in changing the\r\ndirection of its motion. After the planet has passed perihelion the sun\r\nbegins to pull backward and to retard the motion in just the same\r\nmeasure that before perihelion passage it increased it, so that the two\r\nhalves of the orbit on opposite sides of a line drawn from the\r\nperihelion through the sun are exactly alike. We may here note the\r\nexplanation of Kepler's second law: when the planet is near the sun it\r\nmoves faster, and the radius vector changes its direction more rapidly\r\nthan when the planet is remote from the sun on account of the greater\r\nforce with which it is attracted, and the exact relation between the\r\nrates at which the radius vector turns in different parts of the orbit,\r\nas given by the second law, depends upon the changes in this force.\r\n\r\nWhen the velocity is not too great, the sun's backward pull, after a\r\nplanet has passed perihelion, finally overcomes it and turns the planet\r\ntoward the sun again, in such a way that it comes back to the point _P_,\r\nmoving in the same direction and with the same speed as before--i. e.,\r\nit has gone around the sun in an orbit like _P 6_ or _P 4_, an ellipse,\r\nalong which it will continue to move ever after. But we must not fail to\r\nnote that this return into the same orbit is a consequence of the last\r\nline in the statement of the law of gravitation (p. 54), and that, if\r\nthe magnitude of this force were inversely as the cube of the distance\r\nor any other proportion than the square, the orbit would be something\r\nvery different. If the velocity is too great for the sun's attraction to\r\novercome, the orbit will be a hyperbola, like _P 2_, along which the\r\nbody will move away never to return, while a velocity just at the limit\r\nof what the sun can control gives an orbit like _P 3_, a parabola, along\r\nwhich the body moves with _parabolic velocity_, which is ever\r\ndiminishing as the body gets farther from the sun, but is always just\r\nsufficient to keep it from returning. If the earth's velocity could be\r\nincreased 41 per cent, from 19 up to 27 miles per second, it would have\r\nparabolic velocity, and would quit the sun's company.\r\n\r\nThe summation of the whole matter is that the orbit in which a body\r\nmoves around the sun, or past the sun, depends upon its velocity and if\r\nthis velocity and the direction of the motion at any one point in the\r\norbit are known the whole orbit is determined by them, and the position\r\nof the planet in its orbit for past as well as future times can be\r\ndetermined through the application of Newton's laws; and the same is\r\ntrue for any other heavenly body--moon, comet, meteor, etc. It is in\r\nthis way that astronomers are able to predict, years in advance, in what\r\nparticular part of the sky a given planet will appear at a given time.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes a source of wonder that the planets move in ellipses\r\ninstead of circles, but it is easily seen from Fig. 20 that the planet,\r\n_P_, could not by any possibility move in a circle, since the direction\r\nof its motion at _P_ is not at right angles with the line joining it to\r\nthe sun as it must be in a circular orbit, and even if it were\r\nperpendicular to the radius vector the planet must needs have exactly\r\nthe right velocity given to it at this point, since either more or less\r\nspeed would change the circle into an ellipse. In order to produce\r\ncircular motion there must be a balancing of conditions as nice as is\r\nrequired to make a pin stand upon its point, and the really surprising\r\nthing is that the orbits of the planets should be so nearly circular as\r\nthey are. If the orbit of the earth were drawn accurately to scale, the\r\nuntrained eye would not detect the slightest deviation from a true\r\ncircle, and even the orbit of Mercury (Fig. 17), which is much more\r\neccentric than that of the earth, might almost pass for a circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. An impossible orbit.]\r\n\r\nThe orbit _P 2_, which lies between the parabola and the straight line,\r\nis called in geometry a hyperbola, and Newton succeeded in proving from\r\nthe law of gravitation that a body might move under the sun's attraction\r\nin a hyperbola as well as in a parabola or ellipse; but it must move in\r\nsome one of these curves; no other orbit is possible.[1] Thus it would\r\nnot be possible for a body moving under the law of gravitation to\r\ndescribe about the sun any such orbit as is shown in Fig. 21. If the\r\nbody passes a second time through any point of its orbit, such as _P_ in\r\nthe figure, then it must retrace, time after time, the whole path that\r\nit first traversed in getting from _P_ around to _P_ again--i. e., the\r\norbit must be an ellipse.\r\n\r\n  [1] The circle and straight line are considered to be special cases\r\n      of these curves, which, taken collectively, are called the conic\r\n      sections.\r\n\r\nNewton also proved that Kepler's three laws are mere corollaries from\r\nthe law of gravitation, and that to be strictly correct the third law\r\nmust be slightly altered so as to take into account the masses of the\r\nplanets. These are, however, so small in comparison with that of the\r\nsun, that the correction is of comparatively little moment.\r\n\r\n39. PERTURBATIONS.--In what precedes we have considered the motion of a\r\nplanet under the influence of no other force than the sun's attraction,\r\nwhile in fact, as the law of gravitation asserts, every other body in\r\nthe universe is in some measure attracting it and changing its motion.\r\nThe resulting disturbances in the motion of the attracted body are\r\ncalled _perturbations_, but for the most part these are insignificant,\r\nbecause the bodies by whose disturbing attractions they are caused are\r\neither very small or very remote, and it is only when our moving planet,\r\n_P_, comes under the influence of some great disturbing power like\r\nJupiter or one of the other planets that the perturbations caused by\r\ntheir influence need to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the motion of three bodies--sun, Jupiter, planet--which\r\nmust then be dealt with is vastly more complicated than that which we\r\nhave considered, and the ablest mathematicians and astronomers have not\r\nbeen able to furnish a complete solution for it, although they have\r\nworked upon the problem for two centuries, and have developed an immense\r\namount of detailed information concerning it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LICK OBSERVATORY, MOUNT HAMILTON, CAL.]\r\n\r\nIn general each planet works ceaselessly upon the orbit of every other,\r\nchanging its size and shape and position, backward and forward in\r\naccordance with the law of gravitation, and it is a question of serious\r\nmoment how far this process may extend. If the diameter of the earth's\r\norbit were very much increased or diminished by the perturbing action of\r\nthe other planets, the amount of heat received from the sun would be\r\ncorrespondingly changed, and the earth, perhaps, be rendered unfit\r\nfor the support of life. The tipping of the plane of the earth's orbit\r\ninto a new position might also produce serious consequences; but the\r\ngreat French mathematician of a century ago, Laplace, succeeded in\r\nproving from the law of gravitation that although both of these changes\r\nare actually in progress they can not, at least for millions of years,\r\ngo far enough to prove of serious consequence, and the same is true for\r\nall the other planets, unless here and there an asteroid may prove an\r\nexception to the rule.\r\n\r\nThe precession (Chapter V) is a striking illustration of a perturbation\r\nof slightly different character from the above, and another is found in\r\nconnection with the plane of the moon's orbit. It will be remembered\r\nthat the moon in its motion among the stars never goes far from the\r\necliptic, but in a complete circuit of the heavens crosses it twice,\r\nonce in going from south to north and once in the opposite direction.\r\nThe points at which it crosses the ecliptic are called the _nodes_, and\r\nunder the perturbing influence of the sun these nodes move westward\r\nalong the ecliptic about twenty degrees per year, an extraordinarily\r\nrapid perturbation, and one of great consequence in the theory of\r\neclipses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A planet subject to great perturbations by\r\nJupiter.]\r\n\r\n40. WEIGHING THE PLANETS.--Although these perturbations can not be\r\nconsidered dangerous, they are interesting since they furnish a method\r\nfor weighing the planets which produce them. From the law of gravitation\r\nwe learn that the ability of a planet to produce perturbations depends\r\ndirectly upon its mass, since the force _F_ which it exerts contains\r\nthis mass, _m´_, as a factor. So, too, the divisor _r^{2}_ in the\r\nexpression for the force shows that the distance between the disturbing\r\nand disturbed bodies is a matter of great consequence, for the smaller\r\nthe distance the greater the force. When, therefore, the mass of a\r\nplanet such as Jupiter is to be determined from the perturbations it\r\nproduces, it is customary to select some such opportunity as is\r\npresented in Fig. 22, where one of the small planets, called asteroids,\r\nis represented as moving in a very eccentric orbit, which at one point\r\napproaches close to the orbit of Jupiter, and at another place comes\r\nnear to the orbit of the earth. For the most part Jupiter will not exert\r\nany very great disturbing influence upon a planet moving in such an\r\norbit as this, since it is only at rare intervals that the asteroid and\r\nJupiter approach so close to each other, as is shown in the figure. The\r\ntime during which the asteroid is little affected by the attraction of\r\nJupiter is used to study the motion given to it by the sun's\r\nattraction--that is, to determine carefully the undisturbed orbit in\r\nwhich it moves; but there comes a time at which the asteroid passes\r\nclose to Jupiter, as shown in the figure, and the orbital motion which\r\nthe sun imparts to it will then be greatly disturbed, and when the\r\nplanet next comes round to the part of its orbit near the earth the\r\neffect of these disturbances upon its apparent position in the sky will\r\nbe exaggerated by its close proximity to the earth. If now the\r\nastronomer observes the actual position of the asteroid in the sky, its\r\nright ascension and declination, and compares these with the position\r\nassigned to the planet by the law of gravitation when the attraction of\r\nJupiter is ignored, the differences between the observed right\r\nascensions and declinations and those computed upon the theory of\r\nundisturbed motion will measure the influence that Jupiter has had upon\r\nthe asteroid, and the amount by which Jupiter has shifted it, compared\r\nwith the amount by which the sun has moved it--that is, with the motion\r\nin its orbit--furnishes the mass of Jupiter expressed as a fractional\r\npart of the mass of the sun.\r\n\r\nThere has been determined in this manner the mass of every planet in the\r\nsolar system which is large enough to produce any appreciable\r\nperturbation, and all these masses prove to be exceedingly small\r\nfractions of the mass of the sun, as may be seen from the following\r\ntable, in which is given opposite the name of each planet the number by\r\nwhich the mass of the sun must be divided in order to get the mass of\r\nthe planet:\r\n\r\n    Mercury      7,000,000 (?)\r\n    Venus          408,000\r\n    Earth          329,000\r\n    Mars         3,093,500\r\n    Jupiter          1,047.4\r\n    Saturn           3,502\r\n    Uranus          22,800\r\n    Neptune         19,700\r\n\r\nIt is to be especially noted that the mass given for each planet\r\nincludes the mass of all the satellites which attend it, since their\r\ninfluence was felt in the perturbations from which the mass was derived.\r\nThus the mass assigned to the earth is the combined mass of earth and\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n41. DISCOVERY OF NEPTUNE.--The most famous example of perturbations is\r\nfound in connection with the discovery, in the year 1846, of Neptune,\r\nthe outermost planet of the solar system. For many years the motion of\r\nUranus, his next neighbor, had proved a puzzle to astronomers. In\r\naccordance with Kepler's first law this planet should move in an ellipse\r\nhaving the sun at one of its foci, but no ellipse could be found which\r\nexactly fitted its observed path among the stars, although, to be sure,\r\nthe misfit was not very pronounced. Astronomers surmised that the small\r\ndeviations of Uranus from the best path which theory combined with\r\nobservation could assign, were due to perturbations in its motion\r\ncaused by an unknown planet more remote from the sun--a thing easy to\r\nconjecture but hard to prove, and harder still to find the unknown\r\ndisturber. But almost simultaneously two young men, Adams in England and\r\nLe Verrier in France, attacked the problem quite independently of each\r\nother, and carried it to a successful solution, showing that if the\r\nirregularities in the motion of Uranus were indeed caused by an unknown\r\nplanet, then that planet must, in September, 1846, be in the direction\r\nof the constellation Aquarius; and there it was found on September 23d\r\nby the astronomers of the Berlin Observatory whom Le Verrier had invited\r\nto search for it, and found within a degree of the exact point which the\r\nlaw of gravitation in his hands had assigned to it.\r\n\r\nThis working backward from the perturbations experienced by Uranus to\r\nthe cause which produced them is justly regarded as one of the greatest\r\nscientific achievements of the human intellect, and it is worthy of note\r\nthat we are approaching the time at which it may be repeated, for\r\nNeptune now behaves much as did Uranus three quarters of a century ago,\r\nand the most plausible explanation which can be offered for these\r\nanomalies in its path is that the bounds of the solar system must be\r\nagain enlarged to include another disturbing planet.\r\n\r\n42. THE SHAPE OF A PLANET.--There is an effect of gravitation not yet\r\ntouched upon, which is of considerable interest and wide application in\r\nastronomy--viz., its influence in determining the shape of the heavenly\r\nbodies. The earth is a globe because every part of it is drawn toward\r\nthe center by the attraction of the other parts, and if this attraction\r\non its surface were everywhere of equal force the material of the earth\r\nwould be crushed by it into a truly spherical form, no matter what may\r\nhave been the shape in which it was originally made. But such is not the\r\nreal condition of the earth, for its diurnal rotation develops in every\r\nparticle of its body a force which is sometimes called _centrifugal_,\r\nbut which is really nothing more than the inertia of its particles,\r\nwhich tend at every moment to keep unchanged the direction of their\r\nmotion and which thus resist the attraction that pulls them into a\r\ncircular path marked out by the earth's rotation, just as a stone tied\r\nat the end of a string and swung swiftly in a circle pulls upon the\r\nstring and opposes the constraint which keeps it moving in a circle. A\r\nfew experiments with such a stone will show that the faster it goes the\r\nharder does it pull upon the string, and the same is true of each\r\nparticle of the earth, the swiftly moving ones near the equator having a\r\ngreater centrifugal force than the slow ones near the poles. At the\r\nequator the centrifugal force is directly opposed to the force of\r\ngravity, and in effect diminishes it, so that, comparatively, there is\r\nan excess of gravity at the poles which compresses the earth along its\r\naxis and causes it to bulge out at the equator until a balance is thus\r\nrestored. As we have learned from the study of geography, in the case of\r\nthe earth, this compression amounts to about 27 miles, but in the larger\r\nplanets, Jupiter and Saturn, it is much greater, amounting to several\r\nthousand miles.\r\n\r\nBut rotation is not the only influence that tends to pull a planet out\r\nof shape. The attraction which the earth exerts upon the moon is\r\nstronger on the near side and weaker on the far side of our satellite\r\nthan at its center, and this difference of attraction tends to warp the\r\nmoon, as is illustrated in Fig. 23 where _1_, _2_, and _3_ represent\r\npieces of iron of equal mass placed in line on a table near a horseshoe\r\nmagnet, _H_. Each piece of iron is attracted by the magnet and is held\r\nback by a weight to which it is fastened by means of a cord running over\r\na pulley, _P_, at the edge of the table. These weights are all to be\r\nsupposed equally heavy and each of them pulls upon its piece of iron\r\nwith a force just sufficient to balance the attraction of the magnet for\r\nthe middle piece, No. _2_. It is clear that under this arrangement No.\r\n_2_ will move neither to the right nor to the left, since the forces\r\nexerted upon it by the magnet and the weight just balance each other.\r\nUpon No. _1_, however, the magnet pulls harder than upon No. _2_,\r\nbecause it is nearer and its pull therefore more than balances the force\r\nexerted by the weight, so that No. _1_ will be pulled away from No. _2_\r\nand will stretch the elastic cords, which are represented by the lines\r\njoining _1_ and _2_, until their tension, together with the force\r\nexerted by the weight, just balances the attraction of the magnet. For\r\nNo. _3_, the force exerted by the magnet is less than that of the\r\nweight, and it will also be pulled away from No. _2_ until its elastic\r\ncords are stretched to the proper tension. The net result is that the\r\nthree blocks which, without the magnet's influence, would be held close\r\ntogether by the elastic cords, are pulled apart by this outside force as\r\nfar as the resistance of the cords will permit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Tide-raising forces.]\r\n\r\nAn entirely analogous set of forces produces a similar effect upon the\r\nshape of the moon. The elastic cords of Fig. 23 stand for the attraction\r\nof gravitation by which all the parts of the moon are bound together.\r\nThe magnet represents the earth pulling with unequal force upon\r\ndifferent parts of the moon. The weights are the inertia of the moon in\r\nits orbital motion which, as we have seen in a previous section, upon\r\nthe whole just balances the earth's attraction and keeps the moon from\r\nfalling into it. The effect of these forces is to stretch out the moon\r\nalong a line pointing toward the earth, just as the blocks were\r\nstretched out along the line of the magnet, and to make this diameter of\r\nthe moon slightly but permanently longer than the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--The tides.]\r\n\r\nTHE TIDES.--Similarly the moon and the sun attract opposite sides of the\r\nearth with different forces and feebly tend to pull it out of shape. But\r\nhere a new element comes into play: the earth turns so rapidly upon its\r\naxis that its solid parts have no time in which to yield sensibly to the\r\nstrains, which shift rapidly from one diameter to another as different\r\nparts of the earth are turned toward the moon, and it is chiefly the\r\nwaters of the sea which respond to the distorting effect of the sun's\r\nand moon's attraction. These are heaped up on opposite sides of the\r\nearth so as to produce a slight elongation of its diameter, and Fig. 24\r\nshows how by the earth's rotation this swelling of the waters is swept\r\nout from under the moon and is pulled back by the moon until it finally\r\ntakes up some such position as that shown in the figure where the effect\r\nof the earth's rotation in carrying it one way is just balanced by the\r\nmoon's attraction urging it back on line with the moon. This heaping up\r\nof the waters is called a _tide_. If _I_ in the figure represents a\r\nlittle island in the sea the waters which surround it will of course\r\naccompany it in its diurnal rotation about the earth's axis, but\r\nwhenever the island comes back to the position _I_, the waters will\r\nswell up as a part of the tidal wave and will encroach upon the land in\r\nwhat is called high tide or flood tide. So too when they reach _I´´_,\r\nhalf a day later, they will again rise in flood tide, and midway between\r\nthese points, at _I´_, the waters must subside, giving low or ebb tide.\r\n\r\nThe height of the tide raised by the moon in the open sea is only a very\r\nfew feet, and the tide raised by the sun is even less, but along the\r\ncoast of a continent, in bays and angles of the shore, it often happens\r\nthat a broad but low tidal wave is forced into a narrow corner, and then\r\nthe rise of the water may be many feet, especially when the solar tide\r\nand the lunar tide come in together, as they do twice in every month, at\r\nnew and full moon. Why do they come together at these times instead of\r\nsome other?\r\n\r\nSmall as are these tidal effects, it is worth noting that they may in\r\ncertain cases be very much greater--e. g., if the moon were as massive\r\nas is the sun its tidal effect would be some millions of times greater\r\nthan it now is and would suffice to grind the earth into fragments.\r\nAlthough the earth escapes this fate, some other bodies are not so\r\nfortunate, and we shall see in later chapters some evidence of their\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\n43. THE SCOPE OF THE LAW OF GRAVITATION.--In all the domain of physical\r\nscience there is no other law so famous as the Newtonian law of\r\ngravitation; none other that has been so dwelt upon, studied, and\r\nelaborated by astronomers and mathematicians, and perhaps none that can\r\nbe considered so indisputably proved. Over and over again mathematical\r\nanalysis, based upon this law, has pointed out conclusions which, though\r\nhitherto unsuspected, have afterward been found true, as when Newton\r\nhimself derived as a corollary from this law that the earth ought to be\r\nflattened at the poles--a thing not known at that time, and not proved\r\nby actual measurement until long afterward. It is, in fact, this\r\ncapacity for predicting the unknown and for explaining in minutest\r\ndetail the complicated phenomena of the heavens and the earth that\r\nconstitutes the real proof of the law of gravitation, and it is\r\ntherefore worth while to note that at the present time there are a very\r\nfew points at which the law fails to furnish a satisfactory account of\r\nthings observed. Chief among these is the case of the planet Mercury,\r\nthe long diameter of whose orbit is slowly turning around in a way for\r\nwhich the law of gravitation as yet furnishes no explanation. Whether\r\nthis is because the law itself is inaccurate or incomplete, or whether\r\nit only marks a case in which astronomers have not yet properly applied\r\nthe law and traced out its consequences, we do not know; but whether it\r\nbe the one or the other, this and other similar cases show that even\r\nhere, in its most perfect chapter, astronomy still remains an incomplete\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AS A PLANET\r\n\r\n\r\n44. THE SIZE OF THE EARTH.--The student is presumed to have learned, in\r\nhis study of geography, that the earth is a globe about 8,000 miles in\r\ndiameter and, without dwelling upon the \"proofs\" which are commonly\r\ngiven for these statements, we proceed to consider the principles upon\r\nwhich the measurement of the earth's size and shape are based.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Measuring the size of the earth.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 25 the circle represents a meridian section of the earth; _P P´_\r\nis the axis about which it rotates, and the dotted lines represent a\r\nbeam of light coming from a star in the plane of the meridian, and so\r\ndistant that the dotted lines are all practically parallel to each\r\nother. The several radii drawn through the points _1_, _2_, _3_,\r\nrepresent the direction of the vertical at these points, and the angles\r\nwhich these radii produced, make with the rays of starlight are each\r\nequal to the angular distance of the star from the zenith of the place\r\nat the moment the star crosses the meridian. We have already seen, in\r\nChapter II, how these angles may be measured, and it is apparent from\r\nthe figure that the difference between any two of these angles--e. g.,\r\nthe angles at _1_ and _2_--is equal to the angle at the center, _O_,\r\nbetween the points _1_ and _2_. By measuring these angular distances of\r\nthe star from the zenith, the astronomer finds the angles at the center\r\nof the earth between the stations _1_, _2_, _3_, etc., at which his\r\nobservations are made. If the meridian were a perfect circle the change\r\nof zenith distance of the star, as one traveled along a meridian from\r\nthe equator to the pole, would be perfectly uniform--the same number of\r\ndegrees for each hundred miles traveled--and observations made in many\r\nparts of the earth show that this is very nearly true, but that, on the\r\nwhole, as we approach the pole it is necessary to travel a little\r\ngreater distance than is required for a given change in the angle at the\r\nequator. The earth is, in fact, flattened at the poles to the amount of\r\nabout 27 miles in the length of its diameter, and by this amount, as\r\nwell as by smaller variations due to mountains and valleys, the shape of\r\nthe earth differs from a perfect sphere. These astronomical measurements\r\nof the curvature of the earth's surface furnish by far the most\r\nsatisfactory proof that it is very approximately a sphere, and furnish\r\nas its equatorial diameter 7,926 miles.\r\n\r\nNeglecting the _compression_, as it is called, i. e., the 27 miles by\r\nwhich the equatorial diameter exceeds the polar, the size of the earth\r\nmay easily be found by measuring the distance _1_--_2_ along the\r\nsurface and by combining with this the angle _1 O 2_ obtained through\r\nmeasuring the meridian altitudes of any star as seen from _1_ and _2_.\r\nDraw on paper an angle equal to the measured difference of altitude and\r\nfind how far you must go from its vertex in order to have the distance\r\nbetween the sides, measured along an arc of a circle, equal to the\r\nmeasured distance between _1_ and _2_. This distance from the vertex\r\nwill be the earth's radius.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 19.--Measure the diameter of the earth by the method given\r\nabove. In order that this may be done satisfactorily, the two stations\r\nat which observations are made must be separated by a considerable\r\ndistance--i. e., 200 miles. They need not be on the same meridian, but\r\nif they are on different meridians in place of the actual distance\r\nbetween them, there must be used the projection of that distance upon\r\nthe meridian--i. e., the north and south part of the distance.\r\n\r\nBy co-operation between schools in the Northern and Southern States,\r\nusing a good map to obtain the required distances, the diameter of the\r\nearth may be measured with the plumb-line apparatus described in Chapter\r\nII and determined within a small percentage of its true value.\r\n\r\n45. THE MASS OF THE EARTH.--We have seen in Chapter IV the possibility\r\nof determining the masses of the planets as fractional parts of the\r\nsun's mass, but nothing was there shown, or could be shown, about\r\nmeasuring these masses after the common fashion in kilogrammes or tons.\r\nTo do this we must first get the mass of the earth in tons or\r\nkilogrammes, and while the principles involved in this determination are\r\nsimple enough, their actual application is delicate and difficult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Illustrating the principles involved in\r\nweighing the earth.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 26 we suppose a long plumb line to be suspended above the\r\nsurface of the earth and to be attracted toward the center of the earth,\r\n_C_, by a force whose intensity is (Chapter IV)\r\n\r\n    F = k mE/R^{2},\r\n\r\nwhere _E_ denotes the mass of the earth, which is to be determined by\r\nexperiment, and _R_ is the radius of the earth, 3,963 miles. If there is\r\nno disturbing influence present, the plumb line will point directly\r\ndownward, but if a massive ball of lead or other heavy substance is\r\nplaced at one side, _1_, it will attract the plumb line with a force\r\nequal to\r\n\r\n    f = k mB/r^{2},\r\n\r\nwhere _r_ is the distance of its center from the plumb bob and _B_ is\r\nits mass which we may suppose, for illustration, to be a ton. In\r\nconsequence of this attraction the plumb line will be pulled a little to\r\none side, as shown by the dotted line, and if we represent by _l_ the\r\nlength of the plumb line and by _d_ the distance between the original\r\nand the disturbed positions of the plumb bob we may write the proportion\r\n\r\n    F : f :: l : d;\r\n\r\nand introducing the values of _F_ and _f_ given above, and solving for\r\n_E_ the proportion thus transformed, we find\r\n\r\n    E = B × l/d × (R/r)^{2}.\r\n\r\nIn this equation the mass of the ball, _B_, the length of the plumb\r\nline, _l_, the distance between the center of the ball and the center of\r\nthe plumb bob, _r_, and the radius of the earth, _R_, can all be\r\nmeasured directly, and _d_, the amount by which the plumb bob is pulled\r\nto one side by the ball, is readily found by shifting the ball over to\r\nthe other side, at _2_, and measuring with a microscope how far the\r\nplumb bob moves. This distance will, of course, be equal to _2 d_.\r\n\r\nBy methods involving these principles, but applied in a manner more\r\ncomplicated as well as more precise, the mass of the earth is found to\r\nbe, in tons, 6,642 × 10^{18}--i. e., 6,642 followed by 18 ciphers, or in\r\nkilogrammes 60,258 × 10^{20}. The earth's atmosphere makes up about a\r\nmillionth part of this mass.\r\n\r\nIf the length of the plumb line were 100 feet, the weight of the ball a\r\nton, and the distance between the two positions of the ball, _1_ and\r\n_2_, six feet, how many inches, _d_, would the plumb bob be pulled out\r\nof place?\r\n\r\nFind from the mass of the earth and the data of § 40 the mass of the sun\r\nin tons. Find also the mass of Mars. The computation can be very greatly\r\nabridged by the use of logarithms.\r\n\r\n46. PRECESSION.--That the earth is isolated in space and has no support\r\nupon which to rest, is sufficiently shown by the fact that the stars are\r\nvisible upon every side of it, and no support can be seen stretching out\r\ntoward them. We must then consider the earth to be a globe traveling\r\nfreely about the sun in a circuit which it completes once every year,\r\nand rotating once in every twenty-four hours about an axis which remains\r\nat all seasons directed very nearly toward the star Polaris. The student\r\nshould be able to show from his own observations of the sun that, with\r\nreference to the stars, the direction of the sun from the earth changes\r\nabout a degree a day. Does this prove that the earth revolves about the\r\nsun?\r\n\r\nBut it is only in appearance that the pole maintains its fixed position\r\namong the stars. If photographs are taken year after year, after the\r\nmanner of Exercise 7, it will be found that slowly the pole is moving\r\n(nearly) toward Polaris, and making this star describe a smaller and\r\nsmaller circle in its diurnal path, while stars on the other side of the\r\npole (in right ascension 12h.) become more distant from it and describe\r\nlarger circles in their diurnal motion; but the process takes place so\r\nslowly that the space of a lifetime is required for the motion of the\r\npole to equal the angular diameter of the full moon.\r\n\r\nSpin a top and note how its rapid whirl about its axis corresponds to\r\nthe earth's diurnal rotation. When the axis about which the top spins is\r\ntruly vertical the top \"sleeps\"; but if the axis is tipped ever so\r\nlittle away from the vertical it begins to wobble, so that if we imagine\r\nthe axis prolonged out to the sky and provided with a pencil point as a\r\nmarker, this would trace a circle around the zenith, along which the\r\npole of the top would move, and a little observation will show that the\r\nmore the top is tipped from the vertical the larger does this circle\r\nbecome and the more rapidly does the wobbling take place. Were it not\r\nfor the spinning of the top about its axis, it would promptly fall over\r\nwhen tipped from the vertical position, but the spin combines with the\r\nforce which pulls the top over and produces the wobbling motion. Spin\r\nthe top in opposite directions, with the hands of a watch and contrary\r\nto the hands of a watch, and note the effect which is produced upon the\r\nwobbling.\r\n\r\nThe earth presents many points of resemblance to the top. Its diurnal\r\nrotation is the spin about the axis. This axis is tipped 23.5° away from\r\nthe perpendicular to its orbit (obliquity of the ecliptic) just as the\r\naxis of the top is tipped away from the vertical line. In consequence of\r\nits rapid spin, the body of the earth bulges out at the equator (27\r\nmiles), and the sun and moon, by virtue of their attraction (see Chapter\r\nIV), lay hold of this protuberance and pull it down toward the plane of\r\nthe earth's orbit, so that if it were not for the spin this force would\r\nstraighten the axis up and set it perpendicular to the orbit plane. But\r\nhere, as in the case of the top, the spin and the tipping force combine\r\nto produce a wobble which is called precession, and whose effect we\r\nrecognize in the shifting position of the pole among the stars. The\r\nmotion of precession is very much slower than the wobbling of the top,\r\nsince the tipping force for the earth is relatively very small, and a\r\nperiod of nearly 26,000 years is required for a complete circuit of the\r\npole about its center of motion. Friction ultimately stops both the spin\r\nand the wobble of the top, but this influence seems wholly absent in the\r\ncase of the earth, and both rotation and precession go on unchanged from\r\ncentury to century, save for certain minor forces which for a time\r\nchange the direction or rate of the precessional motion, first in one\r\nway and then in another, without in the long run producing any results\r\nof consequence.\r\n\r\nThe center of motion, about which the pole travels in a small circle\r\nhaving an angular radius of 23.5°, is at that point of the heavens\r\ntoward which a perpendicular to the plane of the earth's orbit points,\r\nand may be found on the star map in right ascension 18h. 0m. and\r\ndeclination 66.5°.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 20.--Find this point on the map, and draw as well as you can\r\nthe path of the pole about it. The motion of the pole along its path is\r\ntoward the constellation Cepheus. Mark the position of the pole along\r\nthis path at intervals of 1,000 years, and refer to these positions in\r\ndealing with some of the following questions:\r\n\r\nDoes the wobbling of the top occur in the same direction as the motion\r\nof precession? Do the tipping forces applied to the earth and top act in\r\nthe same direction? What will be the polar star 12,000 years hence? The\r\nGreat Pyramid of Egypt is thought to have been used as an observatory\r\nwhen Alpha Draconis was the bright star nearest the pole. How long ago\r\nwas that?\r\n\r\nThe motion of the pole of course carries the equator and the equinoxes\r\nwith it, and thus slowly changes the right ascensions and declinations\r\nof all the stars. On this account it is frequently called the precession\r\nof the equinoxes, and this motion of the equinox, slow though it is, is\r\na matter of some consequence in connection with chronology and the\r\nlength of the year.\r\n\r\nWill the precession ever bring back the right ascensions and\r\ndeclinations to be again what they now are?\r\n\r\nIn what direction is the pole moving with respect to the Big Dipper?\r\nWill its motion ever bring it exactly to Polaris? How far away from\r\nPolaris will the precession carry the pole? What other bright stars will\r\nbe brought near the pole by the precession?\r\n\r\n47. THE WARMING OF THE EARTH.--Winter and summer alike the day is on the\r\naverage warmer than the night, and it is easy to see that this surplus\r\nof heat comes from the sun by day and is lost by night through radiation\r\ninto the void which surrounds the earth; just as the heat contained in a\r\nmass of molten iron is radiated away and the iron cooled when it is\r\ntaken out from the furnace and placed amid colder surroundings. The\r\nearth's loss of heat by radiation goes on ceaselessly day and night,\r\nand were it not for the influx of solar heat this radiation would\r\nsteadily diminish the temperature toward what is called the \"absolute\r\nzero\"--i. e., a state in which all heat has been taken away and beyond\r\nwhich there can be no greater degree of cold. This must not be\r\nconfounded with the zero temperatures shown by our thermometers,\r\nsince it lies nearly 500° below the zero of the Fahrenheit scale (-273°\r\nCentigrade), a temperature which by comparison makes the coldest winter\r\nweather seem warm, although the ordinary thermometer may register\r\nmany degrees below its zero. The heat radiated by the sun into the\r\nsurrounding space on every side of it is another example of the same\r\ncooling process, a hot body giving up its heat to the colder space about\r\nit, and it is the minute fraction of this heat poured out by the sun,\r\nand in small part intercepted by the earth, which warms the latter and\r\nproduces what we call weather, climate, the seasons, etc.\r\n\r\nObserve the fluctuations, the ebb and flow, which are inherent in this\r\nprocess. From sunset to sunrise there is nothing to compensate the\r\nsteady outflow of heat, and air and ground grow steadily colder, but\r\nwith the sunrise there comes an influx of solar heat, feeble at first\r\nbecause it strikes the earth's surface very obliquely, but becoming more\r\nand more efficient as the sun rises higher in the sky. But as the air\r\nand the ground grow warm during the morning hours they part more and\r\nmore readily and rapidly with their store of heat, just as a steam pipe\r\nor a cup of coffee radiates heat more rapidly when very hot. The warmest\r\nhour of the day is reached when these opposing tendencies of income and\r\nexpenditure of heat are just balanced; and barring such disturbing\r\nfactors as wind and clouds, the gain in temperature usually extends to\r\nthe time--an hour or two beyond noon--at which the diminishing altitude\r\nof the sun renders his rays less efficient, when radiation gains the\r\nupper hand and the temperature becomes for a short time stationary, and\r\nthen commences to fall steadily until the next sunrise.\r\n\r\nWe have here an example of what is called a periodic change--i. e., one\r\nwhich, within a definite and uniform period (24 hours), oscillates from\r\na minimum up to a maximum temperature and then back again to a minimum,\r\nrepeating substantially the same variation day after day. But it must be\r\nunderstood that minor causes not taken into account above, such as\r\nwinds, water, etc., produce other fluctuations from day to day which\r\nsometimes obscure or even obliterate the diurnal variation of\r\ntemperature caused by the sun.\r\n\r\nExpose the back of your hand to the sun, holding the hand in such a\r\nposition that the sunlight strikes perpendicularly upon it; then turn\r\nthe hand so that the light falls quite obliquely upon it and note how\r\nmuch more vigorous is the warming effect of the sun in the first\r\nposition than in the second. It is chiefly this difference of angle that\r\nmakes the sun's warmth more effective when he is high up in the sky than\r\nwhen he is near the horizon, and more effective in summer than in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in Chapter III that the sun's motion among the stars takes\r\nplace along a path which carries it alternately north and south of the\r\nequator to a distance of 23.5°, and the stars show by their earlier\r\nrisings and later settings, as we pass from the equator toward the north\r\npole of the heavens, that as the sun moves northward from the equator,\r\neach day in the northern hemisphere will become a little longer, each\r\nnight a little shorter, and every day the sun will rise higher toward\r\nthe zenith until this process culminates toward the end of June, when\r\nthe sun begins to move southward, bringing shorter days and smaller\r\naltitudes until the Christmas season, when again it is reversed and the\r\nsun moves northward. We have here another periodic variation, which runs\r\nits complete course in a period of a year, and it is easy to see that\r\nthis variation must have a marked effect on the warming of the earth,\r\nthe long days and great altitudes of summer producing the greater warmth\r\nof that season, while the shorter days and lower altitudes of December,\r\nby diminishing the daily supply of solar heat, bring on the winter's\r\ncold. The succession of the seasons, winter following summer and summer\r\nwinter, is caused by the varying altitude of the sun, and this in turn\r\nis due to the obliquity of the ecliptic, or, what is the same thing, the\r\namount by which the axis of the earth is tipped from being perpendicular\r\nto the plane of its orbit, and the seasons are simply a periodic change\r\nin the warming of the earth, quite comparable with the diurnal change\r\nbut of longer period.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the period within which the succession of winter and\r\nsummer is completed, the year, as we commonly call it, must equal the\r\ntime required by the sun to go from the vernal equinox around to the\r\nvernal equinox again, since this furnishes a complete cycle of the sun's\r\nmotions north and south from the equator. On account of the westward\r\nmotion of the equinox (precession) this is not quite the same as the\r\ntime required for a complete revolution of the earth in its orbit, but\r\nis a little shorter (20m. 23s.), since the equinox moves back to meet\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n48. RELATION OF THE SUN TO CLIMATE.--It is clear that both the northern\r\nand southern hemispheres of the earth must have substantially the same\r\nkind of seasons, since the motion of the sun north and south affects\r\nboth alike; but when the sun is north of the equator and warming our\r\nhemisphere most effectively, his light falls more obliquely upon the\r\nother hemisphere, the days there are short and winter reigns at the\r\ntime we are enjoying summer, while six months later the conditions are\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the earth near the equator--the torrid zone--there is\r\nno such marked change from cold to warm as we experience, because, as\r\nthe sun never gets more than 23.5° away from the celestial equator, on\r\nevery day of the year he mounts high in the tropic skies, always coming\r\nwithin 23.5° of the zenith, and usually closer than this, so that there\r\nis no such periodic change in the heat supply as is experienced in\r\nhigher latitudes, and within the tropics the temperature is therefore\r\nboth higher and more uniform than in our latitude.\r\n\r\nIn the frigid zones, on the contrary, the sun never rises high in the\r\nsky; at the poles his greatest altitude is only 23.5°, and during the\r\nwinter season he does not rise at all, so that the temperature is here\r\nlow the whole year round, and during the winter season, when for weeks\r\nor months at a time the supply of solar light is entirely cut off, the\r\ntemperature falls to a degree unknown in more favored climes.\r\n\r\nIf the obliquity of the ecliptic were made 10° greater, what would be\r\nthe effect upon the seasons in the temperate zones? What if it were made\r\n10° less?\r\n\r\nDoes the precession of the equinoxes have any effect upon the seasons or\r\nupon the climate of different parts of the earth?\r\n\r\nIf the axis of the earth pointed toward Arcturus instead of Polaris,\r\nwould the seasons be any different from what they are now?\r\n\r\n49. THE ATMOSPHERE.--Although we live upon its surface, we are not\r\noutside the earth, but at the bottom of a sea of air which forms the\r\nearth's outermost layer and extends above our heads to a height of many\r\nmiles. The study of most of the phenomena of the atmosphere belongs to\r\nthat branch of physics called meteorology, but there are a few matters\r\nwhich fairly come within our consideration of the earth as a planet. We\r\ncan not see the stars save as we look through this atmosphere, and the\r\nlight which comes through it is bent and oftentimes distorted so as to\r\npresent serious obstacles to any accurate telescopic study of the\r\nheavenly bodies. Frequently this disturbance is visible to the naked\r\neye, and the stars are said to twinkle--i. e., to quiver and change\r\ncolor many times per second, solely in consequence of a disturbed\r\ncondition of the air and not from anything which goes on in the star.\r\nThis effect is more marked low down in the sky than near the zenith, and\r\nit is worth noting that the planets show very little of it because the\r\nlight they send to the earth comes from a disk of sensible area, while a\r\nstar, being much smaller and farther from the earth, has its disk\r\nreduced practically to a mere point whose light is more easily affected\r\nby local disturbances in the atmosphere than is the broader beam which\r\ncomes from the planets' disk.\r\n\r\n50. REFRACTION.--At all times, whether the stars twinkle or not, their\r\nlight is bent in its passage through the atmosphere, so that the stars\r\nappear to stand higher up in the sky than their true positions. This\r\neffect, which the astronomer calls refraction, must be allowed for in\r\nobservations of the more precise class, although save at low altitudes\r\nits amount is a very small fraction of a degree, but near the horizon it\r\nis much exaggerated in amount and becomes easily visible to the naked\r\neye by distorting the disks of the sun and moon from circles into ovals\r\nwith their long diameters horizontal. The refraction lifts both upper\r\nand lower edge of the sun, but lifts the lower edge more than the upper,\r\nthus shortening the vertical diameter. See Fig. 27, which shows not only\r\nthis effect, but also the reflection of the sun from the curved surface\r\nof the sea, still further flattening the image. If the surface of the\r\nwater were flat, the reflected image would have the same shape as the\r\nsun's disk, and its altered appearance is sometimes cited as a proof\r\nthat the earth's surface is curved.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of the refraction at the horizon is a little more than\r\nhalf a degree, and since the diameters of the sun and moon subtend an\r\nangle of about half a degree, we have the remarkable result that in\r\nreality the whole disk of either sun or moon is below the horizon at the\r\ninstant that the lower edge appears to touch the horizon and sunset or\r\nmoonset begins. The same effect exists at sunrise, and as a consequence\r\nthe duration of sunshine or of moonshine is on the average about six\r\nminutes longer each day than it would be if there were no atmosphere and\r\nno refraction. A partial offset to this benefit is found in the fact\r\nthat the atmosphere absorbs the light of the heavenly bodies, so that\r\nstars appear much less bright when near the horizon than when they are\r\nhigher up in the sky, and by reason of this absorption the setting sun\r\ncan be looked at with the naked eye without the discomfort which its\r\ndazzling luster causes at noon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Flattening of the sun's disk by refraction and\r\nby reflection from the surface of the sea.]\r\n\r\n51. THE TWILIGHT.--Another effect of the atmosphere, even more marked\r\nthan the preceding, is the twilight. As at sunrise the mountain top\r\ncatches the rays of the coming sun before they reach the lowland, and at\r\nsunset it keeps them after they have faded from the regions below, so\r\nthe particles of dust and vapor, which always float in the atmosphere,\r\ncatch the sunlight and reflect it to the surface of the earth while the\r\nsun is still below the horizon, giving at the beginning and end of day\r\nthat vague and diffuse light which we call twilight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Twilight phenomena.]\r\n\r\nFig. 28 shows a part of the earth surrounded by such a dust-laden\r\natmosphere, which is illuminated on the left by the rays of the sun, but\r\nwhich, on the right of the figure, lies in the shadow cast by the earth.\r\nTo an observer placed at _1_ the sun is just setting, and all the\r\natmosphere above him is illumined with its rays, which furnish a bright\r\ntwilight. When, by the earth's rotation, this observer has been carried\r\nto _2_, all the region to the east of his zenith lies in the shadow,\r\nwhile to the west there is a part of the atmosphere from which there\r\nstill comes a twilight, but now comparatively faint, because the lower\r\npart of the atmosphere about our observer lies in the shadow, and it is\r\nmainly its upper regions from which the light comes, and here the dust\r\nand moisture are much less abundant than in the lower strata. Still\r\nlater, when the observer has been carried by the earth's rotation to the\r\npoint _3_, every vestige of twilight will have vanished from his sky,\r\nbecause all of the illuminated part of the atmosphere is now below his\r\nhorizon, which is represented by the line _3 L_. In the figure the sun\r\nis represented to be 78° below this horizon line at the end of twilight,\r\nbut this is a gross exaggeration, made for the sake of clearness in the\r\ndrawing--in fact, twilight is usually said to end when the sun is 18°\r\nbelow the horizon.\r\n\r\nLet the student redraw Fig. 28 on a large scale, so that the points _1_\r\nand _3_ shall be only 18° apart, as seen from the earth's center. He\r\nwill find that the point _L_ is brought down much closer to the surface\r\nof the earth, and measuring the length of the line _2 L_, he should find\r\nfor the \"height of the atmosphere\" about one-eightieth part of the\r\nradius of the earth--i. e., a little less than 50 miles. This, however,\r\nis not the true height of the atmosphere. The air extends far beyond\r\nthis, but the particles of dust and vapor which are capable of sending\r\nsunlight down to the earth seem all to lie below this limit.\r\n\r\nThe student should not fail to watch the eastern sky after sunset, and\r\nsee the shadow of the earth rise up and fill it while the twilight arch\r\nretreats steadily toward the west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--The cause of long and short twilights.]\r\n\r\n_Duration of twilight._--Since twilight ends when the sun is 18° below\r\nthe horizon, any circumstance which makes the sun go down rapidly will\r\nshorten the duration of twilight, and anything which retards the\r\ndownward motion of the sun will correspondingly prolong it. Chief among\r\ninfluences of this kind is the angle which the sun's course makes with\r\nthe horizon. If it goes straight down, as at _a_, Fig. 29, a much\r\nshorter time will suffice to carry it to a depression of 18° than is\r\nneeded in the case shown at _b_ in the same figure, where the motion is\r\nvery oblique to the horizon. If we consider different latitudes and\r\ndifferent seasons of the year, we shall find every possible variety of\r\ncircumstance from _a_ to _b_, and corresponding to these, the duration\r\nof twilight varies from an all-night duration in the summers of Scotland\r\nand more northern lands to an hour or less in the mountains of Peru. For\r\nthe sake of graphical effect, the shortness of tropical twilight is\r\nsomewhat exaggerated by Coleridge in the lines,\r\n\r\n    \"The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:\r\n     At one stride comes the dark.\"\r\n                            _The Ancient Mariner._\r\n\r\nIn the United States the longest twilights come at the end of June, and\r\nlast for a little more than two hours, while the shortest ones are in\r\nMarch and September, amounting to a little more than an hour and a half;\r\nbut at all times the last half hour of twilight is hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from night, so small is the quantity of reflecting matter\r\nin the upper regions of the atmosphere. For practical convenience it is\r\ncustomary to assume in the courts of law that twilight ends an hour\r\nafter sunset.\r\n\r\nHow long does twilight last at the north pole?\r\n\r\n_The Aurora._--One other phenomenon of the atmosphere may be mentioned,\r\nonly to point out that it is not of an astronomical character. The\r\nAurora, or northern lights, is as purely an affair of the earth as is a\r\nthunderstorm, and its explanation belongs to the subject of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MEASUREMENT OF TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n52. SOLAR TIME.--To measure any quantity we need a unit in terms of\r\nwhich it must be expressed. Angles are measured in degrees, and the\r\ndegree is the unit for angular measurement. For most scientific purposes\r\nthe centimeter is adopted as the unit with which to measure distances,\r\nand similarly a day is the fundamental unit for the measurement of time.\r\nHours, minutes, and seconds are aliquot parts of this unit convenient\r\nfor use in dealing with shorter periods than a day, and the week, month,\r\nand year which we use in our calendars are multiples of the day.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, a day is not the time required by the earth to make\r\none revolution upon its axis, but it is best defined as the amount of\r\ntime required for a particular part of the sky to make the complete\r\ncircuit from the meridian of a particular place through west and east\r\nback to the meridian again. The day begins at the moment when this\r\nspecified part of the sky is on the meridian, and \"the time\" at any\r\nmoment is the hour angle of this particular part of the sky--i. e., the\r\nnumber of hours, minutes, etc., that have elapsed since it was on the\r\nmeridian.\r\n\r\nThe student has already become familiar with the kind of day which is\r\nbased upon the motion of the vernal equinox, and which furnishes\r\nsidereal time, and he has seen that sidereal time, while very convenient\r\nin dealing with the motions of the stars, is decidedly inconvenient for\r\nthe ordinary affairs of life since in the reckoning of the hours it\r\ntakes no account of daylight and darkness. One can not tell off-hand\r\nwhether 10 hours, sidereal time, falls in the day or in the night. We\r\nmust in some way obtain a day and a system of time reckoning based upon\r\nthe apparent diurnal motion of the sun, and we may, if we choose, take\r\nthe sun itself as the point in the heavens whose transit over the\r\nmeridian shall mark the beginning and the end of the day. In this system\r\n\"the time\" is the number of hours, minutes, etc., which have elapsed\r\nsince the sun was on the meridian, and this is the kind of time which is\r\nshown by a sun dial, and which was in general use, years ago, before\r\nclocks and watches became common. Since the sun moves among the stars\r\nabout a degree per day, it is easily seen that the rotating earth will\r\nhave to turn farther in order to carry any particular meridian from the\r\nsun around to the sun again, than to carry it from a star around to the\r\nsame star, or from the vernal equinox around to the vernal equinox\r\nagain; just as the minute hand of a clock turns farther in going from\r\nthe hour hand round to the hour hand again than it turns in going from\r\nXII to XII. These solar days and hours and minutes are therefore a\r\nlittle longer than the corresponding sidereal ones, and this furnishes\r\nthe explanation why the stars come to the meridian a little earlier, by\r\nsolar time, every night than on the night before, and why sidereal time\r\ngains steadily upon solar time, this gain amounting to approximately\r\n3m. 56.5s. per day, or exactly one day per year, since the sun makes the\r\ncomplete circuit of the constellations once in a year.\r\n\r\nWith the general introduction of clocks and watches into use about a\r\ncentury ago this kind of solar time went out of common use, since no\r\nwell-regulated clock could keep the time correctly. The earth in its\r\norbital motion around the sun goes faster in some parts of its orbit\r\nthan in others, and in consequence the sun appears to move more rapidly\r\namong the stars in winter than in summer; moreover, on account of the\r\nconvergence of hour circles as we go away from the equator, the same\r\namount of motion along the ecliptic produces more effect in winter and\r\nsummer when the sun is north or south, than it does in the spring and\r\nautumn when the sun is near the equator, and as a combined result of\r\nthese causes and other minor ones true solar time, as it is called, is\r\nitself not uniform, but falls behind the uniform lapse of sidereal time\r\nat a variable rate, sometimes quicker, sometimes slower. A true solar\r\nday, from noon to noon, is 51 seconds shorter in September than in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--The equation of time.]\r\n\r\n53. MEAN SOLAR TIME.--To remedy these inconveniences there has been\r\ninvented and brought into common use what is called _mean solar time_,\r\nwhich is perfectly uniform in its lapse and which, by comparison with\r\nsidereal time, loses exactly one day per year. \"The time\" in this system\r\nnever differs much from true solar time, and the difference between the\r\ntwo for any particular day may be found in any good almanac, or may be\r\nread from the curve in Fig. 30, in which the part of the curve above the\r\nline marked _0m_ shows how many minutes mean solar time is faster than\r\ntrue solar time. The correct name for this difference between the two\r\nkinds of solar time is the _equation of time_, but in the almanacs it is\r\nfrequently marked \"sun fast\" or \"sun slow.\" In sidereal time and true\r\nsolar time the distinction between A. M. hours (_ante meridiem_ =\r\nbefore the sun reaches the meridian) and P. M. hours (_post meridiem_ =\r\nafter the sun has passed the meridian) is not observed, \"the time\" being\r\ncounted from 0 hours to 24 hours, commencing when the sun or vernal\r\nequinox is on the meridian. Occasionally the attempt is made to\r\nintroduce into common use this mode of reckoning the hours, beginning\r\nthe day (date) at midnight and counting the hours consecutively up to\r\n24, when the next date is reached and a new start made. Such a system\r\nwould simplify railway time tables and similar publications; but the\r\nAmerican public is slow to adopt it, although the system has come into\r\npractical use in Canada and Spain.\r\n\r\n54. TO FIND (APPROXIMATELY) THE SIDEREAL TIME AT ANY MOMENT.--RULE I.\r\nWhen the mean solar time is known. Let _W_ represent the time shown by\r\nan ordinary watch, and represent by _S_ the corresponding sidereal time\r\nand by _D_ the number of days that have elapsed from March 23d to the\r\ndate in question. Then\r\n\r\n    S = W + 69/70 × D × 4.\r\n\r\nThe last term is expressed in minutes, and should be reduced to hours\r\nand minutes. Thus at 4 P. M. on July 4th--\r\n\r\n                _D_ = 103 days.\r\n    69/70 × _D_ × 4 = 406m.\r\n                    = 6h. 46m.\r\n                _W_ = 4h. 0m.\r\n                _S_ = 10h. 46m.\r\n\r\nThe daily gain of sidereal upon mean solar time is 69/70 of 4 minutes,\r\nand March 23d is the date on which sidereal and mean solar time are\r\ntogether, taking the average of one year with another, but it varies a\r\nlittle from year to year on account of the extra day introduced in leap\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nRULE II. When the stars in the northern sky can be seen. Find [b]\r\nCassiopeiæ, and imagine a line drawn from it to Polaris, and another\r\nline from Polaris to the zenith. The sidereal time is equal to the angle\r\nbetween these lines, provided that that angle must be measured from the\r\nzenith toward the west. Turn the angle from degrees into hours by\r\ndividing by 15.\r\n\r\n55. THE EARTH'S ROTATION.--We are familiar with the fact that a watch\r\nmay run faster at one time than at another, and it is worth while to\r\ninquire if the same is not true of our chief timepiece--the earth. It is\r\nassumed in the sections upon the measurement of time that the earth\r\nturns about its axis with absolute uniformity, so that mean solar time\r\nnever gains or loses even the smallest fraction of a second. Whether\r\nthis be absolutely true or not, no one has ever succeeded in finding\r\nconvincing proof of a variation large enough to be measured, although it\r\nhas recently been shown that the axis about which it rotates is not\r\nperfectly fixed within the body of the earth. The solid body of the\r\nearth wriggles about this axis like a fish upon a hook, so that the\r\nposition of the north pole upon the earth's surface changes within a\r\nyear to the extent of 40 or 50 feet (15 meters) without ever getting\r\nmore than this distance away from its average position. This is probably\r\ncaused by the periodical shifting of masses of air and water from one\r\npart of the earth to another as the seasons change, and it seems\r\nprobable that these changes will produce some small effect upon the\r\nrotation of the earth. But in spite of these, for any such moderate\r\ninterval of time as a year or a century, so far as present knowledge\r\ngoes, we may regard the earth's rotation as uniform and undisturbed. For\r\nlonger intervals--e. g., 1,000,000 or 10,000,000 years--the question is\r\na very different one, and we shall have to meet it again in another\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n56. LONGITUDE AND TIME.--In what precedes there has been constant\r\nreference to the meridian. The day begins when the sun is on the\r\nmeridian. Solar time is the angular distance of the sun past the\r\nmeridian. Sidereal time was determined by observing transits of stars\r\nover a meridian line actually laid out upon the ground, etc. But every\r\nplace upon the earth has its own meridian from which \"the time\" may be\r\nreckoned, and in Fig. 31, where the rays of sunlight are represented as\r\nfalling upon a part of the earth's equator through which the meridians\r\nof New York, Chicago, and San Francisco pass, it is evident that these\r\nrays make different angles with the meridians, and that the sun is\r\nfarther from the meridian of New York than from that of San Francisco by\r\nan amount just equal to the angle at _O_ between these meridians. This\r\nangle is called by geographers the difference of longitude between the\r\ntwo places, and the student should note that the word longitude is here\r\nused in a different sense from that on page 36. From Fig. 31 we obtain\r\nthe\r\n\r\n_Theorem._--The difference between \"the times\" at any two meridians is\r\nequal to their difference of longitude, and the time at the eastern\r\nmeridian is greater than at the western meridian. Astronomers usually\r\nexpress differences of longitude in hours instead of degrees. 1h. = 15°.\r\n\r\nThe name given to any kind of time should distinguish all the elements\r\nwhich enter into it--e. g., New York sidereal time means the hour angle\r\nof the vernal equinox measured from the meridian of New York, Chicago\r\ntrue solar time is the hour angle of the sun reckoned from the meridian\r\nof Chicago, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Longitude and time]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Standard time.]\r\n\r\n57. STANDARD TIME.--The requirements of railroad traffic have led to the\r\nuse throughout the United States and Canada of four \"standard times,\"\r\neach of which is a mean solar time some integral number of hours slower\r\nthan the time of the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory at\r\nGreenwich, England.\r\n\r\n    Eastern time is 5 hours slower than that of Greenwich.\r\n    Central  \"      6  \"      \"     \"    \"         \"\r\n    Mountain \"      7  \"      \"     \"    \"         \"\r\n    Pacific  \"      8  \"      \"     \"    \"         \"\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 32 the broken lines indicate roughly the parts of the United\r\nStates and Canada in which these several kinds of time are used, and\r\nillustrate how irregular are the boundaries of these parts.\r\n\r\nStandard time is sent daily into all of the more important telegraph\r\noffices of the United States, and serves to regulate watches and clocks,\r\nto the almost complete exclusion of local time.\r\n\r\n58. TO DETERMINE THE LONGITUDE.--With an ordinary watch observe the time\r\nof the sun's transit over your local meridian, and correct the observed\r\ntime for the equation of time by means of the curve in Fig. 30. The\r\ndifference between the corrected time and 12 o'clock will be the\r\ncorrection of your watch referred to local mean solar time. Compare your\r\nwatch with the time signals in the nearest telegraph office and find its\r\ncorrection referred to standard time. The difference between the two\r\ncorrections is the difference between your longitude and that of the\r\nstandard meridian.\r\n\r\nN. B.--Don't tamper with the watch by trying to \"set it right.\" No harm\r\nwill be done if it is wrong, provided you take due account of the\r\ncorrection as indicated above.\r\n\r\nIf the correction of the watch changed between your observation and the\r\ncomparison in the telegraph office, what effect would it have upon the\r\nlongitude determination? How can you avoid this effect?\r\n\r\n59. CHRONOLOGY.--The Century Dictionary defines chronology as \"the\r\nscience of time\"--that is, \"the method of measuring or computing time\r\nby regular divisions or periods according to the revolutions of the sun\r\nor moon.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that for the measurement of short intervals of time\r\nthe day and its subdivisions--hours, minutes, seconds--furnish a very\r\ncomplete and convenient system. But for longer periods, extending to\r\nhundreds and thousands of days, a larger unit of time is required, and\r\nfor the most part these longer units have in all ages and among all\r\npeoples been based upon astronomical considerations. But to this there\r\nis one marked exception. The week is a simple multiple of the day, as\r\nthe dime is a multiple of the cent, and while it may have had its origin\r\nin the changing phases of the moon this is at best doubtful, since it\r\ndoes not follow these with any considerable accuracy. If the still\r\nlonger units of time--the month and the year--had equally been made to\r\nconsist of an integral number of days much confusion and\r\nmisunderstanding might have been avoided, and the annals of ancient\r\ntimes would have presented fewer pitfalls to the historian than is now\r\nthe case. The month is plainly connected with the motion of the moon\r\namong the stars. The year is, of course, based upon the motion of the\r\nsun through the heavens and the change of seasons which is thus\r\nproduced; although, as commonly employed, it is not quite the same as\r\nthe time required by the earth to make one complete revolution in its\r\norbit. This time of one revolution is called a sidereal year, while, as\r\nwe have already seen in Chapter V, the year which measures the course of\r\nthe seasons is shorter than this on account of the precession of the\r\nequinoxes. It is called a tropical year with reference to the circuit\r\nwhich the sun makes from one tropic to the other and back again.\r\n\r\nWe can readily understand why primitive peoples should adopt as units of\r\ntime these natural periods, but in so doing they incurred much the same\r\nkind of difficulty that we should experience in trying to use both\r\nEnglish and American money in the ordinary transactions of life. How\r\nmany dollars make a pound sterling? How shall we make change with\r\nEnglish shillings and American dimes, etc.? How much is one unit worth\r\nin terms of the other?\r\n\r\nOne of the Greek poets[2] has left us a quaint account of the confusion\r\nwhich existed in his time with regard to the place of months and moons\r\nin the calendar:\r\n\r\n    \"The moon by us to you her greeting sends,\r\n    But bids us say that she's an ill-used moon\r\n    And takes it much amiss that you will still\r\n    Shuffle her days and turn them topsy-turvy,\r\n    So that when gods, who know their feast days well,\r\n    By your false count are sent home supperless,\r\n    They scold and storm at her for your neglect.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] Aristophanes, The Clouds, Whewell's translation.\r\n\r\n60. DAY, MONTH, AND YEAR.--If the day, the month, and the year are to be\r\nused concurrently, it is necessary to determine how many days are\r\ncontained in the month and year, and when this has been done by the\r\nastronomer the numbers are found to be very awkward and inconvenient for\r\ndaily use; and much of the history of chronology consists in an account\r\nof the various devices by which ingenious men have sought to use\r\nintegral numbers to replace the cumbrous decimal fractions which follow.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Harkness, for the epoch 1900 A. D.--\r\n\r\n    One tropical year = 365.242197 mean solar days.\r\n     \"     \"      \"   = 365d. 5h. 48m. 45.8s.\r\n    One lunation      = 29.530588 mean solar days.\r\n     \"     \"          = 29d. 12h. 44m. 2.8s.\r\n\r\nThe word _lunation_ means the average interval from one new moon to the\r\nnext one--i. e., the time required by the moon to go from conjunction\r\nwith the sun round to conjunction again.\r\n\r\nA very ancient device was to call a year equal to 365 days, and to have\r\nmonths alternately of 29 and 30 days in length, but this was\r\nunsatisfactory in more than one way. At the end of four years this\r\nartificial calendar would be about one day ahead of the true one, at the\r\nend of forty years ten days in error, and within a single lifetime the\r\nseasons would have appreciably changed their position in the year, April\r\nweather being due in March, according to the calendar. So, too, the year\r\nunder this arrangement did not consist of any integral number of months,\r\n12 months of the average length of 29.5 days being 354 days, and 13\r\nmonths 383.5 days, thus making any particular month change its position\r\nfrom the beginning to the middle and the end of the year within a\r\ncomparatively short time. Some peoples gave up the astronomical year as\r\nan independent unit and adopted a conventional year of 12 lunar months,\r\n354 days, which is now in use in certain Mohammedan countries, where it\r\nis known as the wandering year, with reference to the changing positions\r\nof the seasons in such a year. Others held to the astronomical year and\r\nadopted a system of conventional months, such that twelve of them would\r\njust make up a year, as is done to this day in our own calendar, whose\r\nmonths of arbitrary length we are compelled to remember by some such\r\njingle as the following:\r\n\r\n    \"Thirty days hath September,\r\n    April, June, and November;\r\n    All the rest have thirty-one\r\n    Save February,\r\n    Which alone hath twenty-eight,\r\n    Till leap year gives it twenty-nine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n61. THE CALENDAR.--The foundations of our calendar may fairly be\r\nascribed to Julius Cæsar, who, under the advice of the Egyptian\r\nastronomer Sosigines, adopted the old Egyptian device of a leap year,\r\nwhereby every fourth year was to consist of 366 days, while ordinary\r\nyears were only 365 days long. He also placed the beginning of the year\r\nat the first of January, instead of in March, where it had formerly\r\nbeen, and gave his own name, Julius, to the month which we now call\r\nJuly. August was afterward named in honor of his successor, Augustus.\r\nThe names of the earlier months of the year are drawn from Roman\r\nmythology; those of the later months, September, October, etc., meaning\r\nseventh month, eighth month, represent the places of these months in the\r\nyear, before Cæsar's reformation, and also their places in some of the\r\nsubsequent calendars, for the widest diversity of practice existed\r\nduring mediæval times with regard to the day on which the new year\r\nshould begin, Christmas, Easter, March 25th, and others having been\r\nemployed at different times and places.\r\n\r\nThe system of leap years introduced by Cæsar makes the average length of\r\na year 365.25 days, which differs by about eleven minutes from the true\r\nlength of the tropical year, a difference so small that for ordinary\r\npurposes no better approximation to the true length of the year need be\r\ndesired. But _any_ deviation from the true length, however small, must\r\nin the course of time shift the seasons, the vernal and autumnal\r\nequinox, to another part of the year, and the ecclesiastical authorities\r\nof mediæval Europe found here ground for objection to Cæsar's calendar,\r\nsince the great Church festival of Easter has its date determined with\r\nreference to the vernal equinox, and with the lapse of centuries Easter\r\nbecame more and more displaced in the calendar, until Pope Gregory XIII,\r\nlate in the sixteenth century, decreed another reformation, whereby ten\r\ndays were dropped from the calendar, the day after March 11th being\r\ncalled March 21st, to bring back the vernal equinox to the date on which\r\nit fell in A. D. 325, the time of the Council of Nicæa, which Gregory\r\nadopted as the fundamental epoch of his calendar.\r\n\r\nThe calendar having thus been brought back into agreement with that of\r\nold time, Gregory purposed to keep it in such agreement for the future\r\nby modifying Cæsar's leap-year rule so that it should run: Every year\r\nwhose number is divisible by 4 shall be a leap year except those years\r\nwhose numbers are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. These\r\nlatter years--e. g., 1900--are counted as common years. The calendar\r\nthus altered is called Gregorian to distinguish it from the older,\r\nJulian calendar, and it found speedy acceptance in those civilized\r\ncountries whose Church adhered to Rome; but the Protestant powers were\r\nslow to adopt it, and it was introduced into England and her American\r\ncolonies by act of Parliament in the year 1752, nearly two centuries\r\nafter Gregory's time. In Russia the Julian calendar has remained in\r\ncommon use to our own day, but in commercial affairs it is there\r\ncustomary to write the date according to both calendars--e. g., July\r\n4/16, and at the present time strenuous exertions are making in that\r\ncountry for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar to the complete\r\nexclusion of the Julian one.\r\n\r\nThe Julian and Gregorian calendars are frequently represented by the\r\nabbreviations O. S. and N. S., old style, new style, and as the older\r\nhistorical dates are usually expressed in O. S., it is sometimes\r\nconvenient to transform a date from the one calendar to the other. This\r\nis readily done by the formula\r\n\r\n    G = J + (N - 2) - N/4,\r\n\r\nwhere _G_ and _J_ are the respective dates, _N_ is the number of the\r\ncentury, and the remainder is to be neglected in the division by 4. For\r\nSeptember 3, 1752, O. S., we have\r\n\r\n        J = Sept. 3\r\n    N - 2 = + 15\r\n    - N/4 = -  4\r\n    ------------------\r\n        G = Sept. 14\r\n\r\nand September 14 is the date fixed by act of Parliament to correspond to\r\nSeptember 3, 1752, O. S. Columbus discovered America on October 12,\r\n1492, O. S. What is the corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar?\r\n\r\n62. THE DAY OF THE WEEK.--A problem similar to the above but more\r\ncomplicated consists in finding the day of the week on which any given\r\ndate of the Gregorian calendar falls--e. g., October 21, 1492.\r\n\r\nThe formula for this case is\r\n\r\n    7q + r = Y + D + (Y - 1)/4 - (Y - 1)/100 + (Y - 1)/400\r\n\r\nwhere _Y_ denotes the given year, _D_ the number of the day (date) in\r\nthat year, and _q_ and _r_ are respectively the quotient and the\r\nremainder obtained by dividing the second member of the equation by 7.\r\nIf _r_ = 1 the date falls on Sunday, etc., and if _r_ = 0 the day is\r\nSaturday. For the example suggested above we have\r\n\r\n      Jan.  31\r\n      Feb.  29\r\n      Mch.  31\r\n      April 30\r\n      May   31\r\n      June  30\r\n      July  31\r\n      Aug.  31\r\n      Sept. 30\r\n      Oct.  21\r\n           ---\r\n       D = 295\r\n\r\n                  Y =  1492\r\n                + D = + 295\r\n    + (Y - 1) ÷   4 = + 372\r\n    - (Y - 1) ÷ 100 = -  14\r\n    + (Y - 1) ÷ 400 = +   3\r\n                     -------\r\n                    7) 2148\r\n\r\n                  _q_ =   306\r\n                  _r_ =     6 = Friday.\r\n\r\nFind from some history the day of the week on which Columbus first saw\r\nAmerica, and compare this with the above.\r\n\r\nOn what day of the week did last Christmas fall? On what day of the week\r\nwere you born? In the formula for the day of the week why does _q_ have\r\nthe coefficient 7? What principles in the calendar give rise to the\r\ndivisors 4, 100, 400?\r\n\r\nFor much curious and interesting information about methods of reckoning\r\nthe lapse of time the student may consult the articles Calendar and\r\nChronology in any good encyclopædia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YERKES OBSERVATORY, WILLIAMS BAY, WIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nECLIPSES\r\n\r\n\r\n63. THE NATURE OF ECLIPSES.--Every planet has a shadow which travels\r\nwith the planet along its orbit, always pointing directly away from the\r\nsun, and cutting off from a certain region of space the sunlight which\r\notherwise would fill it. For the most part these shadows are invisible,\r\nbut occasionally one of them falls upon a planet or some other body\r\nwhich shines by reflected sunlight, and, cutting off its supply of\r\nlight, produces the striking phenomenon which we call an eclipse. The\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars are eclipsed whenever they\r\nplunge into the shadows cast by their respective planets, and Jupiter\r\nhimself is partially eclipsed when one of his own satellites passes\r\nbetween him and the sun, and casts upon his broad surface a shadow too\r\nsmall to cover more than a fraction of it.\r\n\r\nBut the eclipses of most interest to us are those of the sun and moon,\r\ncalled respectively solar and lunar eclipses. In Fig. 33 the full moon,\r\n_M´_, is shown immersed in the shadow cast by the earth, and therefore\r\neclipsed, and in the same figure the new moon, _M_, is shown as casting\r\nits shadow upon the earth and producing an eclipse of the sun. From a\r\nmere inspection of the figure we may learn that an eclipse of the sun\r\ncan occur only at new moon--i. e., when the moon is on line between the\r\nearth and sun--and an eclipse of the moon can occur only at full moon.\r\nWhy? Also, the eclipsed moon, _M´_, will present substantially the same\r\nappearance from every part of the earth where it is at all visible--the\r\nsame from North America as from South America--but the eclipsed sun\r\nwill present very different aspects from different parts of the earth.\r\nThus, at _L_, within the moon's shadow, the sunlight will be entirely\r\ncut off, producing what is called a total eclipse. At points of the\r\nearth's surface near _J_ and _K_ there will be no interference whatever\r\nwith the sunlight, and no eclipse, since the moon is quite off the line\r\njoining these regions to any part of the sun. At places between _J_ and\r\n_L_ or _K_ and _L_ the moon will cut off a part of the sun's light, but\r\nnot all of it, and will produce what is called a partial eclipse, which,\r\nas seen from the northern parts of the earth, will be an eclipse of the\r\nlower (southern) part of the sun, and as seen from the southern\r\nhemisphere will be an eclipse of the northern part of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Different kinds of eclipse.]\r\n\r\nThe moon revolves around the earth in a plane, which, in the figure, we\r\nsuppose to be perpendicular to the surface of the paper, and to pass\r\nthrough the sun along the line _M´ M_ produced. But it frequently\r\nhappens that this plane is turned to one side of the sun, along some\r\nsuch line as _P Q_, and in this case the full moon would cut through the\r\nedge of the earth's shadow without being at any time wholly immersed in\r\nit, giving a partial eclipse of the moon, as is shown in the figure.\r\n\r\nIn what parts of the earth would this eclipse be visible? What kinds of\r\nsolar eclipse would be produced by the new moon at _Q_? In what parts of\r\nthe earth would they be visible?\r\n\r\n64. THE SHADOW CONE.--The shape and position of the earth's shadow are\r\nindicated in Fig. 33 by the lines drawn tangent to the circles which\r\nrepresent the sun and earth, since it is only between these lines that\r\nthe earth interferes with the free radiation of sunlight, and since both\r\nsun and earth are spheres, and the earth is much the smaller of the two,\r\nit is evident that the earth's shadow must be, in geometrical language,\r\na cone whose base is at the earth, and whose vertex lies far to the\r\nright of the figure--in other words, the earth's shadow, although very\r\nlong, tapers off finally to a point and ends. So, too, the shadow of the\r\nmoon is a cone, having its base at the moon and its vertex turned away\r\nfrom the sun, and, as shown in the figure, just about long enough to\r\nreach the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is easily shown, by the theorem of similar triangles in connection\r\nwith the known size of the earth and sun, that the distance from the\r\ncenter of the earth to the vertex of its shadow is always equal to the\r\ndistance of the earth from the sun divided by 108, and, similarly, that\r\nthe length of the moon's shadow is equal to the distance of the moon\r\nfrom the sun divided by 400, the moon's shadow being the smaller and\r\nshorter of the two, because the moon is smaller than the earth. The\r\nradius of the moon's orbit is just about 1/400th part of the radius of\r\nthe earth's orbit--i. e., the distance of the moon from the earth is\r\n1/400th part of the distance of the earth from the sun, and it is this\r\n\"chance\" agreement between the length of the moon's shadow and the\r\ndistance of the moon from the earth which makes the tip of the moon's\r\nshadow fall very near the earth at the time of solar eclipses. Indeed,\r\nthe elliptical shape of the moon's orbit produces considerable\r\nvariations in the distance of the moon from the earth, and in\r\nconsequence of these variations the vertex of the shadow sometimes falls\r\nshort of reaching the earth, and sometimes even projects considerably\r\nbeyond its farther side. When the moon's distance is too great for the\r\nshadow to bridge the space between earth and moon there can be no total\r\neclipse of the sun, for there is no shadow which can fall upon the\r\nearth, even though the moon does come directly between earth and sun.\r\nBut there is then produced a peculiar kind of partial eclipse called\r\n_annular_, or ring-shaped, because the moon, although eclipsing the\r\ncentral parts of the sun, is not large enough to cover the whole of it,\r\nbut leaves the sun's edge visible as a ring of light, which completely\r\nsurrounds the moon. Although, strictly speaking, this is only a partial\r\neclipse, it is customary to put total and annular eclipses together in\r\none class, which is called central eclipses, since in these eclipses the\r\nline of centers of sun and moon strikes the earth, while in ordinary\r\npartial eclipses it passes to one side of the earth without striking it.\r\nIn this latter case we have to consider another cone called the\r\n_penumbra_--i. e., partial shadow--which is shown in Fig. 33 by the\r\nbroken lines tangent to the sun and moon, and crossing at the point _V_,\r\nwhich is the vertex of this cone. This penumbral cone includes within\r\nits surface all that region of space within which the moon cuts off any\r\nof the sunlight, and of course it includes the shadow cone which\r\nproduces total eclipses. Wherever the penumbra falls there will be a\r\nsolar eclipse of some kind, and the nearer the place is to the axis of\r\nthe penumbra, the more nearly total will be the eclipse. Since the moon\r\nstands about midway between the earth and the vertex of the penumbra,\r\nthe diameter of the penumbra where it strikes the earth will be about\r\ntwice as great as the diameter of the moon, and the student should be\r\nable to show from this that the region of the earth's surface within\r\nwhich a partial solar eclipse is visible extends in a straight line\r\nabout 2,100 miles on either side of the region where the eclipse is\r\ntotal. Measured along the curved surface of the earth, this distance is\r\nfrequently much greater.\r\n\r\nIs it true that if at any time the axis of the shadow cone comes within\r\n2,100 miles of the earth's surface a partial eclipse will be visible in\r\nthose parts of the earth nearest the axis of the shadow?\r\n\r\n65. DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF LUNAR AND SOLAR ECLIPSES.--One marked\r\ndifference between lunar and solar eclipses which has been already\r\nsuggested, may be learned from Fig. 33. The full moon, _M´_, will be\r\nseen eclipsed from every part of the earth where it is visible at all at\r\nthe time of the eclipse--that is, from the whole night side of the\r\nearth; while the eclipsed sun will be seen eclipsed only from those\r\nparts of the day side of the earth upon which the moon's shadow or\r\npenumbra falls. Since the point of the shadow at best but little more\r\nthan reaches to the earth, the amount of space upon the earth which it\r\ncan cover at any one moment is very small, seldom more than 100 to 200\r\nmiles in length, and it is only within the space thus actually covered\r\nby the shadow that the sun is at any given moment totally eclipsed, but\r\nwithin this region the sun disappears, absolutely, behind the solid body\r\nof the moon, leaving to view only such outlying parts and appendages as\r\nare too large for the moon to cover. At a lunar eclipse, on the other\r\nhand, the earth coming between sun and moon cuts off the light from the\r\nlatter, but, curiously enough, does not cut it off so completely that\r\nthe moon disappears altogether from sight even in mid-eclipse. The\r\nexplanation of this continued visibility is furnished by the broken\r\nlines extending, in Fig. 33, from the earth through the moon. These\r\nrepresent sunlight, which, entering the earth's atmosphere near the edge\r\nof the earth (edge as seen from sun and moon), passes through it and\r\nemerges in a changed direction, refracted, into the shadow cone and\r\nfeebly illumines the moon's surface with a ruddy light like that often\r\nshown in our red sunsets. Eclipse and sunset alike show that when the\r\nsun's light shines through dense layers of air it is the red rays which\r\ncome through most freely, and the attentive observer may often see at a\r\nclear sunset something which corresponds exactly to the bending of the\r\nsunlight into the shadow cone; just before the sun reaches the horizon\r\nits disk is distorted from a circle into an oval whose horizontal\r\ndiameter is longer than the vertical one (see § 50).\r\n\r\nQUERY.--At a total lunar eclipse what would be the effect upon the\r\nappearance of the moon if the atmosphere around the edge of the earth\r\nwere heavily laden with clouds?\r\n\r\n66. THE TRACK OF THE SHADOW.--We may regard the moon's shadow cone as a\r\nhuge pencil attached to the moon, moving with it along its orbit in the\r\ndirection of the arrowhead (Fig. 34), and as it moves drawing a black\r\nline across the face of the earth at the time of total eclipse. This\r\nblack line is the path of the shadow and marks out those regions within\r\nwhich the eclipse will be total at some stage of its progress. If the\r\npoint of the shadow just reaches the earth its trace will have no\r\nsensible width, while, if the moon is nearer, the point of the cone will\r\nbe broken off, and, like a blunt pencil, it will draw a broad streak\r\nacross the earth, and this under the most favorable circumstances may\r\nhave a breadth of a little more than 160 miles and a length of 10,000 or\r\n12,000 miles. The student should be able to show from the known distance\r\nof the moon (240,000 miles) and the known interval between consecutive\r\nnew moons (29.5 days) that on the average the moon's shadow sweeps past\r\nthe earth at the rate of 2,100 miles per hour, and that in a general way\r\nthis motion is from west to east, since that is the direction of the\r\nmoon's motion in its orbit. The actual velocity with which the moon's\r\nshadow moves past a given station may, however, be considerably greater\r\nor less than this, since on the one hand when the shadow falls very\r\nobliquely, as when the eclipse occurs near sunrise or sunset, the\r\nshifting of the shadow will be very much greater than the actual motion\r\nof the moon which produces it, and on the other hand the earth in\r\nrevolving upon its axis carries the spectator and the ground upon which\r\nhe stands along the same direction in which the shadow is moving. At the\r\nequator, with the sun and moon overhead, this motion of the earth\r\nsubtracts about 1,000 miles per hour from the velocity with which the\r\nshadow passes by. It is chiefly on this account, the diminished velocity\r\nwith which the shadow passes by, that total solar eclipses last longer\r\nin the tropics than in higher latitudes, but even under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances the duration of totality does not reach eight\r\nminutes at any one place, although it may take the shadow several hours\r\nto sweep the entire length of its path across the earth.\r\n\r\nAccording to Whitmell the greatest possible duration of a total solar\r\neclipse is 7m. 40s., and it can attain this limit only when the eclipse\r\noccurs near the beginning of July and is visible at a place 5° north of\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\nThe duration of a lunar eclipse depends mainly upon the position of the\r\nmoon with respect to the earth's shadow. If it strikes the shadow\r\ncentrally, as at _M´_, Fig. 33, a total eclipse may last for about two\r\nhours, with an additional hour at the beginning and end, during which\r\nthe moon is entering and leaving the earth's shadow. If the moon meets\r\nthe shadow at one side of the axis, as at _P_, the total phase of the\r\neclipse may fail altogether, and between these extremes the duration of\r\ntotality may be anything from two hours downward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Relation of the lunar nodes to eclipses.]\r\n\r\n67. RELATION OF THE LUNAR NODES TO ECLIPSES.--To show why the moon\r\nsometimes encounters the earth's shadow centrally and more frequently at\r\nfull moon passes by without touching it at all, we resort to Fig. 34,\r\nwhich represents a part of the orbit of the earth about the sun, with\r\ndates showing the time in each year at which the earth passes the part\r\nof its orbit thus marked. The orbit of the moon about the earth, _M M´_,\r\nis also shown, with the new moon, _M_, casting its shadow toward the\r\nearth and the full moon, _M´_, apparently immersed in the earth's\r\nshadow. But here appearances are deceptive, and the student who has\r\nmade the observations set forth in Chapter III has learned for himself\r\na fact of which careful account must now be taken. The apparent paths of\r\nthe moon and sun among the stars are great circles which lie near each\r\nother, but are not exactly the same; and since these great circles are\r\nonly the intersections of the sky with the planes of the earth's orbit\r\nand the moon's orbit, we see that these planes are slightly inclined to\r\neach other and must therefore intersect along some line passing through\r\nthe center of the earth. This line, _N´ N´´_, is shown in the figure,\r\nand if we suppose the surface of the paper to represent the plane of the\r\nearth's orbit, we shall have to suppose the moon's orbit to be tipped\r\naround this line, so that the left side of the orbit lies above and the\r\nright side below the surface of the paper. But since the earth's shadow\r\nlies in the plane of its orbit--i. e., in the surface of the paper--the\r\nfull moon of March, _M´_, must have passed below the shadow, and the new\r\nmoon, _M_, must have cast its shadow above the earth, so that neither a\r\nlunar nor a solar eclipse could occur in that month. But toward the end\r\nof May the earth and moon have reached a position where the line\r\n_N´ N´´_ points almost directly toward the sun, in line with the shadow\r\ncones which hide it. Note that the line _N´ N´´_ remains very nearly\r\nparallel to its original position, while the earth is moving along its\r\norbit. The full moon will now be very near this line and therefore very\r\nclose to the plane of the earth's orbit, if not actually in it, and must\r\npass through the shadow of the earth and be eclipsed. So also the new\r\nmoon will cast its shadow in the plane of the ecliptic, and this shadow,\r\nfalling upon the earth, produced the total solar eclipse of May 28,\r\n1900.\r\n\r\n_N´ N´´_ is called the line of nodes of the moon's orbit (§ 39), and the\r\ntwo positions of the earth in its orbit, diametrically opposite each\r\nother, at which _N´ N´´_ points exactly toward the sun, we shall call\r\nthe _nodes_ of the lunar orbit. Strictly speaking, the nodes are those\r\npoints of the sky against which the moon's center is projected at the\r\nmoment when in its orbital motion it cuts through the plane of the\r\nearth's orbit. Bearing in mind these definitions, we may condense much\r\nof what precedes into the proposition: Eclipses of either sun or moon\r\ncan occur only when the earth is at or near one of the nodes of the\r\nmoon's orbit. Corresponding to these positions of the earth there are in\r\neach year two seasons, about six months apart, at which times, and at\r\nthese only, eclipses can occur. Thus in the year 1900 the earth passed\r\nthese two points on June 2d and November 24th respectively, and the\r\nfollowing list of eclipses which occurred in that year shows that all of\r\nthem were within a few days of one or the other of these dates:\r\n\r\n        _Eclipses of the Year 1900_\r\n\r\n    Total solar eclipse          May 28th.\r\n    Partial lunar eclipse        June 12th.\r\n    Annular (solar) eclipse      November 21st.\r\n\r\n68. ECLIPSE LIMITS.--If the earth is exactly at the node at the time of\r\nnew moon, the moon's shadow will fall centrally upon it and will produce\r\nan eclipse visible within the torrid zone, since this is that part of\r\nthe earth's surface nearest the plane of its orbit. If the earth is near\r\nbut not at the node, the new moon will stand a little north or south of\r\nthe plane of the earth's orbit, and its shadow will strike the earth\r\nfarther north or south than before, producing an eclipse in the\r\ntemperate or frigid zones; or the shadow may even pass entirely above or\r\nbelow the earth, producing no eclipse whatever, or at most a partial\r\neclipse visible near the north or south pole. Just how many days' motion\r\nthe earth may be away from the node and still permit an eclipse is shown\r\nin the following brief table of eclipse limits, as they are called:\r\n\r\n                  _Solar Eclipse Limits_\r\n\r\n  If at any new moon the earth is\r\n\r\n  Less than 10 days away from a node, a central eclipse is certain.\r\n  Between 10 and 16 days   \"  \"  \"    some kind of eclipse is certain.\r\n  Between 16 and 19 days   \"  \"  \"    a partial eclipse is possible.\r\n  More than 19 days        \"  \"  \"    no eclipse is possible.\r\n\r\n                _Lunar Eclipse Limits_\r\n\r\n  If at any full moon the earth is\r\n\r\n  Less than 4 days away from a node, a total eclipse is certain.\r\n  Between 4 and 10 days   \"  \"  \"    some kind of eclipse is certain.\r\n  Between 10 and 14 days  \"  \"  \"    a partial eclipse is possible.\r\n  More than 14 days       \"  \"  \"    no eclipse is possible.\r\n\r\nFrom this table of eclipse limits we may draw some interesting\r\nconclusions about the frequency with which eclipses occur.\r\n\r\n69. NUMBER OF ECLIPSES IN A YEAR.--Whenever the earth passes a node of\r\nthe moon's orbit a new moon must occur at some time during the 2 × 16\r\ndays that the earth remains inside the limits where some kind of eclipse\r\nis certain, and there must therefore be an eclipse of the sun every time\r\nthe earth passes a node of the moon's orbit. But, since there are two\r\nnodes past which the earth moves at least once in each year, there must\r\nbe at least two solar eclipses every year. Can there be more than two?\r\nOn the average, will central or partial eclipses be the more numerous?\r\n\r\nA similar line of reasoning will not hold true for eclipses of the moon,\r\nsince it is quite possible that no full moon should occur during the 20\r\ndays required by the earth to move past the node from the western to the\r\neastern limit. This omission of a full moon while the earth is within\r\nthe eclipse limits sometimes happens at both nodes in the same year, and\r\nthen we have a year with no eclipse of the moon. The student may note in\r\nthe list of eclipses for 1900 that the partial lunar eclipse of June\r\n12th occurred 10 days after the earth passed the node, and was therefore\r\nwithin the doubtful zone where eclipses may occur and may fail, and\r\ncorresponding to this position the eclipse was a very small one, only a\r\nthousandth part of the moon's diameter dipping into the shadow of the\r\nearth. By so much the year 1900 escaped being an illustration of a year\r\nin which no lunar eclipse occurred.\r\n\r\nA partial eclipse of the moon will usually occur about a fortnight\r\nbefore or after a total eclipse of the sun, since the full moon will\r\nthen be within the eclipse limit at the opposite node. A partial eclipse\r\nof the sun will always occur about a fortnight before or after a total\r\neclipse of the moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--The eclipse of May 28, 1900.]\r\n\r\n70. ECLIPSE MAPS.--It is the custom of astronomers to prepare, in\r\nadvance of the more important eclipses, maps showing the trace of the\r\nmoon's shadow across the earth, and indicating the times of beginning\r\nand ending of the eclipses, as is shown in Fig. 35. While the actual\r\nconstruction of such a map requires much technical knowledge, the\r\nprinciples involved are simple enough: the straight line passed through\r\nthe center of sun and moon is the axis of the shadow cone, and the map\r\ncontains little more than a graphical representation of when and where\r\nthis cone meets the surface of the earth. Thus in the map, the \"Path of\r\nTotal Eclipse\" is the trace of the shadow cone across the face of the\r\nearth, and the width of this path shows that the earth encountered the\r\nshadow considerably inside the vertex of the cone. The general direction\r\nof the path is from west to east, and the slight sinuousities which it\r\npresents are for the most part due to unavoidable distortion of the\r\nmap caused by the attempt to represent the curved surface of the earth\r\nupon the flat surface of the paper. On either side of the Path of Total\r\nEclipse is the region within which the eclipse was only partial, and the\r\nbroken lines marked Begins at 3h., Ends at 3h., show the intersection of\r\nthe penumbral cone with the surface of the earth at 3 P. M., Greenwich\r\ntime. These two lines inclose every part of the earth's surface from\r\nwhich at that time any eclipse whatever could be seen, and at this\r\nmoment the partial eclipse was just beginning at every point on the\r\neastern edge of the penumbra and just ending at every point on the\r\nwestern edge, while at the center of the penumbra, on the Path of Total\r\nEclipse, lay the shadow of the moon, an oval patch whose greatest\r\ndiameter was but little more than 60 miles in length, and within which\r\nlay every part of the earth where the eclipse was total at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe position of the penumbra at other hours is also shown on the map,\r\nalthough with more distortion, because it then meets the surface of the\r\nearth more obliquely, and from these lines it is easy to obtain the time\r\nof beginning and end of the eclipse at any desired place, and to\r\nestimate by the distance of the place from the Path of Total Eclipse how\r\nmuch of the sun's face was obscured.\r\n\r\nLet the student make these \"predictions\" for Washington, Chicago,\r\nLondon, and Algiers.\r\n\r\nThe points in the map marked First Contact, Last Contact, show the\r\nplaces at which the penumbral cone first touched the earth and finally\r\nleft it. According to computations made as a basis for the construction\r\nof the map the Greenwich time of First Contact was 0h. 12.5m. and of\r\nLast Contact 5h. 35.6m., and the difference between these two times\r\ngives the total duration of the eclipse upon the earth--i. e., 5 hours\r\n23.1 minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Central eclipses for the first two decades of\r\nthe twentieth century. OPPOLZER.]\r\n\r\n71. FUTURE ECLIPSES.--An eclipse map of a different kind is shown in\r\nFig. 36, which represents the shadow paths of all the central eclipses\r\nof the sun, visible during the period 1900-1918 A. D., in those parts of\r\nthe earth north of the south temperate zone. Each continuous black line\r\nshows the path of the shadow in a total eclipse, from its beginning, at\r\nsunrise, at the western end of the line to its end, sunset, at the\r\neastern end, the little circle near the middle of the line showing the\r\nplace at which the eclipse was total at noon. The broken lines represent\r\nsimilar data for the annular eclipses. This map is one of a series\r\nprepared by the Austrian astronomer, Oppolzer, showing the path of every\r\nsuch eclipse from the year 1200 B. C. to 2160 A. D., a period of more\r\nthan three thousand years.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the dates of the eclipses shown in this map we shall find\r\nthat they are not limited to the particular seasons, May and November,\r\nin which those of the year 1900 occurred, but are scattered through all\r\nthe months of the year, from January to December. This shows at once\r\nthat the line of nodes, _N´ N´´_, of Fig. 34, does not remain in a fixed\r\nposition, but turns round in the plane of the earth's orbit so that in\r\ndifferent years the earth reaches the node in different months. The\r\nprecession has already furnished us an illustration of a similar change,\r\nthe slow rotation of the earth's axis, producing a corresponding\r\nshifting of the line in which the planes of the equator and ecliptic\r\nintersect; and in much the same way, through the disturbing influence of\r\nthe sun's attraction, the line _N´ N´´_ is made to revolve westward,\r\nopposite to the arrowheads in Fig. 34, at the rate of nearly 20° per\r\nyear, so that the earth comes to each node about 19 days earlier in each\r\nyear than in the year preceding, and the eclipse season in each year\r\ncomes on the average about 19 days earlier than in the year before,\r\nalthough there is a good deal of irregularity in the amount of change in\r\nparticular years.\r\n\r\n72. RECURRENCE OF ECLIPSES.--Before the beginning of the Christian era\r\nastronomers had found out a rough-and-ready method of predicting\r\neclipses, which is still of interest and value. The substance of the\r\nmethod is that if we start with any eclipse whatever--e. g., the eclipse\r\nof May 28, 1900--and reckon forward or backward from that date a period\r\nof 18 years and 10 or 11 days, we shall find another eclipse quite\r\nsimilar in its general characteristics to the one with which we started.\r\nThus, from the map of eclipses (Fig. 36), we find that a total solar\r\neclipse will occur on June 8, 1918, 18 years and 11 days after the one\r\nillustrated in Fig. 35. This period of 18 years and 11 days is called\r\n_saros_, an ancient word which means cycle or repetition, and since\r\nevery eclipse is repeated after the lapse of a saros, we may find the\r\ndates of all the eclipses of 1918 by adding 11 days to the dates given\r\nin the table of eclipses for 1900 (§ 67), and it is to be especially\r\nnoted that each eclipse of 1918 will be like its predecessor of 1900 in\r\ncharacter--lunar, solar, partial, total, etc. The eclipses of any year\r\nmay be predicted by a similar reference to those which occurred eighteen\r\nyears earlier. Consult a file of old almanacs.\r\n\r\nThe exact length of a saros is 223 lunar months, each of which is a\r\nlittle more than 29.5 days long, and if we multiply the exact value of\r\nthis last number (see § 60) by 223, we shall find for the product\r\n6,585.32 days, which is equal to 18 years 11.32 days when there are four\r\nleap years included in the 18, or 18 years 10.32 days when the number of\r\nleap years is five; and in applying the saros to the prediction of\r\neclipses, due heed must be paid to the number of intervening leap years.\r\nTo explain why eclipses are repeated at the end of the saros, we note\r\nthat the occurrence of an eclipse depends solely upon the relative\r\npositions of the earth, moon, and node of the moon's orbit, and the\r\neclipse will be repeated as often as these three come back to the\r\nposition which first produced it. This happens at the end of every\r\nsaros, since the saros is, approximately, the least common multiple of\r\nthe length of the year, the length of the lunar month, and the length of\r\ntime required by the line of nodes to make a complete revolution around\r\nthe ecliptic. If the saros were exactly a multiple of these three\r\nperiods, every eclipse would be repeated over and over again for\r\nthousands of years; but such is not the case, the saros is not an exact\r\nmultiple of a year, nor is it an exact multiple of the time required for\r\na revolution of the line of nodes, and in consequence the restitution\r\nwhich comes at the end of the saros is not a perfect one. The earth at\r\nthe 223d new moon is in fact about half a day's motion farther west,\r\nrelative to the node, than it was at the beginning, and the resulting\r\neclipse, while very similar, is not precisely the same as before. After\r\nanother 18 years, at the second repetition, the earth is a day farther\r\nfrom the node than at first, and the eclipse differs still more in\r\ncharacter, etc. This is shown in Fig. 37, which represents the apparent\r\npositions of the disks of the sun and moon as seen from the center of\r\nthe earth at the end of each sixth saros, 108 years, where the upper row\r\nof figures represents the number of repetitions of the eclipse from the\r\nbeginning, marked _0_, to the end, _72_. The solar eclipse limits, 10,\r\n16, 19 days, are also shown, and all those eclipses which fall between\r\nthe 10-day limits will be central as seen from some part of the earth,\r\nthose between 16 and 19 partial wherever seen, while between 10 and 16\r\nthey may be either total or partial. Compare the figure with the\r\nfollowing description given by Professor Newcomb: \"A series of such\r\neclipses commences with a very small eclipse near one pole of the earth.\r\nGradually increasing for about eleven recurrences, it will become\r\ncentral near the same pole. Forty or more central eclipses will then\r\nrecur, the central line moving slowly toward the other pole. The series\r\nwill then become partial, and finally cease. The entire duration of the\r\nseries will be more than a thousand years. A new series commences, on\r\nthe average, at intervals of thirty years.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Graphical illustration of the saros.]\r\n\r\nA similar figure may be constructed to represent the recurrence of lunar\r\neclipses; but here, in consequence of the smaller eclipse limits, we\r\nshall find that a series is of shorter duration, a little over eight\r\ncenturies as compared with twelve centuries, which is the average\r\nduration of a series of solar eclipses.\r\n\r\nOne further matter connected with the saros deserves attention. During\r\nthe period of 6,585.32 days the earth has 6,585 times turned toward the\r\nsun the same face upon which the moon's shadow fell at the beginning of\r\nthe saros, but at the end of the saros the odd 0.32 of a day gives the\r\nearth time to make about a third of a revolution more before the eclipse\r\nis repeated, and in consequence the eclipse is seen in a different\r\nregion of the earth, on the average about 116° farther west in\r\nlongitude. Compare in Fig. 36 the regions in which the eclipses of 1900\r\nand 1918 are visible.\r\n\r\nIs this change in the region where the repeated eclipse is visible, true\r\nof lunar eclipses as well as solar?\r\n\r\n73. USE OF ECLIPSES.--At all times and among all peoples eclipses, and\r\nparticularly total eclipses of the sun, have been reckoned among the\r\nmost impressive phenomena of Nature. In early times and among\r\nuncultivated people they were usually regarded with apprehension, often\r\namounting to a terror and frenzy, which civilized travelers have not\r\nscrupled to use for their own purposes with the aid of the eclipse\r\npredictions contained in their almanacs, threatening at the proper time\r\nto destroy the sun or moon, and pointing to the advancing eclipse as\r\nproof that their threats were not vain. In our own day and our own land\r\nthese feelings of awe have not quite disappeared, but for the most part\r\neclipses are now awaited with an interest and pleasure which, contrasted\r\nwith the former feelings of mankind, furnish one of the most striking\r\nillustrations of the effect of scientific knowledge in transforming\r\nhuman fear and misery into a sense of security and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nBut to the astronomer an eclipse is more than a beautiful illustration\r\nof the working of natural laws; it is in varying degree an opportunity\r\nof adding to his store of knowledge respecting the heavenly bodies. The\r\nregion immediately surrounding the sun is at most times closed to\r\nresearch by the blinding glare of the sun's own light, so that a planet\r\nas large as the moon might exist here unseen were it not for the\r\noccasional opportunity presented by a total eclipse which shuts off the\r\nexcessive light and permits not only a search for unknown planets but\r\nfor anything and everything which may exist around the sun. More than\r\none astronomer has reported the discovery of such planets, and at least\r\none of these has found a name and a description in some of the books,\r\nbut at the present time most astronomers are very skeptical about the\r\nexistence of any such object of considerable size, although there is\r\nsome reason to believe that an enormous number of little bodies, ranging\r\nin size from grains of sand upward, do move in this region, as yet\r\nunseen and offering to the future problems for investigation.\r\n\r\nBut in other directions the study of this region at the times of total\r\neclipse has yielded far larger returns, and in the chapter on the sun we\r\nshall have to consider the marvelous appearances presented by the solar\r\nprominences and by the corona, an appendage of the sun which reaches out\r\nfrom his surface for millions of miles but is never seen save at an\r\neclipse. Photographs of the corona are taken by astronomers at every\r\nopportunity, and reproductions of some of these may be found in Chapter\r\nX.\r\n\r\nAnnular eclipses and lunar eclipses are of comparatively little\r\nconsequence, but any recorded eclipse may become of value in connection\r\nwith chronology. We date our letters in a particular year of the\r\ntwentieth century, and commonly suppose that the years are reckoned from\r\nthe birth of Christ; but this is an error, for the eclipses which were\r\nobserved of old and by the chroniclers have been associated with events\r\nof his life, when examined by the astronomers are found quite\r\ninconsistent with astronomic theory. They are, however, reconciled with\r\nit if we assume that our system of dates has its origin four years after\r\nthe birth of Christ, or, in other words, that Christ was born in the\r\nyear 4 B. C. A mistake was doubtless made at the time the Christian era\r\nwas introduced into chronology. At many other points the chance record\r\nof an eclipse in the early annals of civilization furnishes a similar\r\nmeans of controlling and correcting the dates assigned by the historian\r\nto events long past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS AND THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN THEIR USE\r\n\r\n\r\n74. TWO FAMILIAR INSTRUMENTS.--In previous chapters we have seen that a\r\nclock and a divided circle (protractor) are needed for the observations\r\nwhich an astronomer makes, and it is worth while to note here that the\r\ngeography of the sky and the science of celestial motions depend\r\nfundamentally upon these two instruments. The protractor is a simple\r\ninstrument, a humble member of the family of divided circles, but untold\r\nlabor and ingenuity have been expended on this family to make possible\r\nthe construction of a circle so accurately divided that with it angles\r\nmay be measured to the tenth of a second instead of to the tenth of a\r\ndegree--i. e., 3,600 times as accurate as the protractor furnishes.\r\n\r\nThe building of a good clock is equally important and has cost a like\r\namount of labor and pains, so that it is a far cry from Galileo and his\r\ndiscovery that a pendulum \"keeps time\" to the modern clock with its\r\naccurate construction and elaborate provision against disturbing\r\ninfluences of every kind. Every such timepiece, whether it be of the\r\nnutmeg variety which sells for a dollar, or whether it be the standard\r\nclock of a great national observatory, is made up of the same essential\r\nparts that fall naturally into four classes, which we may compare with\r\nthe departments of a well-ordered factory: I. A timekeeping department,\r\nthe pendulum or balance spring, whose oscillations must all be of equal\r\nduration. II. A power department, the weights or mainspring, which,\r\nwhen wound, store up the power applied from outside and give it out\r\npiecemeal as required to keep the first department running. III. A\r\npublication department, the dial and hands, which give out the time\r\nfurnished by Department I. IV. A transportation department, the wheels,\r\nwhich connect the other three and serve as a means of transmitting power\r\nand time from one to the other. The case of either clock or watch is\r\nmerely the roof which shelters it and forms no department of its\r\nindustry. Of these departments the first is by far the most important,\r\nand its good or bad performance makes or mars the credit of the clock.\r\nBeware of meddling with the balance wheel of your watch.\r\n\r\n75. RADIANT ENERGY.--But we have now to consider other instruments which\r\nin practice supplement or displace the simple apparatus hitherto\r\nemployed. Among the most important of these modern instruments are the\r\ntelescope, the spectroscope, and the photographic camera; and since all\r\nthese instruments deal with the light which comes from the stars to the\r\nearth, we must for their proper understanding take account of the nature\r\nof that light, or, more strictly speaking, we must take account of the\r\nradiant energy emitted by the sun and stars, which energy, coming from\r\nthe sun, is translated by our nerves into the two different sensations\r\nof light and heat. The radiant energy which comes from the stars is not\r\nfundamentally different from that of the sun, but the amount of energy\r\nfurnished by any star is so small that it is unable to produce through\r\nour nerves any sensible perception of heat, and for the same reason the\r\nvast majority of stars are invisible to the unaided eye; they do not\r\nfurnish a sufficient amount of energy to affect the optic nerves. A hot\r\nbrick taken into the hand reveals its presence by the two different\r\nsensations of heat and pressure (weight); but as there is only one brick\r\nto produce the two sensations, so there is only one energy to produce\r\nthrough its action upon different nerves the two sensations of light\r\nand heat, and this energy is called _radiant_ because it appears to\r\nstream forth radially from everything which has the capacity of emitting\r\nit. For the detailed study of radiant energy the student is referred to\r\nthat branch of science called physics; but some of its elementary\r\nprinciples may be learned through the following simple experiment, which\r\nthe student should not fail to perform for himself:\r\n\r\nDrop a bullet or other similar object into a bucket of water and observe\r\nthe circular waves which spread from the place where it enters the\r\nwater. These waves are a form of radiant energy, but differing from\r\nlight or heat in that they are visibly confined to a single plane, the\r\nsurface of the water, instead of filling the entire surrounding space.\r\nBy varying the size of the bucket, the depth of the water, the weight of\r\nthe bullet, etc., different kinds of waves, big and little, may be\r\nproduced; but every such set of waves may be described and defined in\r\nall its principal characteristics by means of three numbers--viz., the\r\nvertical height of the waves from hollow to crest; the distance of one\r\nwave from the next; and the velocity with which the waves travel across\r\nthe water. The last of these quantities is called the velocity of\r\npropagation; the second is called the wave length; one half of the first\r\nis called the amplitude; and all these terms find important applications\r\nin the theory of light and heat.\r\n\r\nThe energy of the falling bullet, the disturbance which it produced on\r\nentering the water, was carried by the waves from the center to the edge\r\nof the bucket but not beyond, for the wave can go only so far as the\r\nwater extends. The transfer of energy in this way requires a perfectly\r\ncontinuous medium through which the waves may travel, and the whole\r\nvisible universe is supposed to be filled with something called _ether_,\r\nwhich serves everywhere as a medium for the transmission of radiant\r\nenergy just as the water in the experiment served as a medium for\r\ntransmitting in waves the energy furnished to it by the falling bullet.\r\nThe student may think of this energy as being transmitted in spherical\r\nwaves through the ether, every glowing body, such as a star, a candle\r\nflame, an arc lamp, a hot coal, etc., being the origin and center of\r\nsuch systems of waves, and determining by its own physical and chemical\r\nproperties the wave length and amplitude of the wave systems given off.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of any light depends upon the amplitude of the\r\ncorresponding vibration, and its color depends upon the wave length. By\r\ningenious devices which need not be here described it has been found\r\npossible to measure the wave length corresponding to different\r\ncolors--e. g., all of the colors of the rainbow, and some of these wave\r\nlengths expressed in tenth meters are as follows: A tenth meter is the\r\nlength obtained by dividing a meter into 10^{10} equal parts. 10^{10} =\r\n10,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n                 Color.

THE NORTHERN CONSTELLATIONS]\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"extreme limit of visible violet\" or red used above must be\r\nunderstood to mean that in general the eye is not able to detect radiant\r\nenergy having a wave length less than 3,900 or greater than 7,600 tenth\r\nmeters. Radiant energy, however, exists in waves of both greater and\r\nshorter length than the above, and may be readily detected by apparatus\r\nnot subject to the limitations of the human eye--e. g., a common\r\nthermometer will show a rise of temperature when its bulb is exposed to\r\nradiant energy of wave length much greater than 7,600 tenth meters,\r\nand a photographic plate will be strongly affected by energy of\r\nshorter wave length than 3,900 tenth meters.\r\n\r\n76. REFLECTION AND CONDENSATION OF WAVES.--When the waves produced by\r\ndropping a bullet into a bucket of water meet the sides of the bucket,\r\nthey appear to rebound and are reflected back toward the center, and if\r\nthe bullet is dropped very near the center of the bucket the reflected\r\nwaves will meet simultaneously at this point and produce there by their\r\ncombined action a wave higher than that which was reflected at the walls\r\nof the bucket. There has been a condensation of energy produced by the\r\nreflection, and this increased energy is shown by the greater amplitude\r\nof the wave. The student should not fail to notice that each portion of\r\nthe wave has traveled out and back over the radius of the bucket, and\r\nthat they meet simultaneously at the center because of this equality of\r\nthe paths over which they travel, and the resulting equality of time\r\nrequired to go out and back. If the bullet were dropped at one side of\r\nthe center, would the reflected waves produce _at any point_ a\r\ncondensation of energy?\r\n\r\nIf the bucket were of elliptical instead of circular cross section and\r\nthe bullet were dropped at one focus of the ellipse there would be\r\nproduced a condensation of reflected energy at the other focus, since\r\nthe sum of the paths traversed by each portion of the wave before and\r\nafter reflection is equal to the sum of the paths traversed by every\r\nother portion, and all parts of the wave reach the second focus at the\r\nsame time. Upon what geometrical principle does this depend?\r\n\r\nThe condensation of wave energy in the circular and elliptical buckets\r\nare special cases under the general principle that such a condensation\r\nwill be produced at any point which is so placed that different parts of\r\nthe wave front reach it simultaneously, whether by reflection or by some\r\nother means, as shown below.\r\n\r\nThe student will note that for the sake of greater precision we here\r\nsay _wave front_ instead of wave. If in any wave we imagine a line drawn\r\nalong the crest, so as to touch every drop which at that moment is\r\nexactly at the crest, we shall have what is called a wave front, and\r\nsimilarly a line drawn through the trough between two waves, or through\r\nany set of drops similarly placed on a wave, constitutes a wave front.\r\n\r\n77. MIRRORS AND LENSES.--That form of radiant energy which we recognize\r\nas light and heat may be reflected and condensed precisely as are the\r\nwaves of water in the exercise considered above, but owing to the\r\nextreme shortness of the wave length in this case the reflecting surface\r\nshould be very smooth and highly polished. A piece of glass hollowed out\r\nin the center by grinding, and with a light film of silver chemically\r\ndeposited upon the hollow surface and carefully polished, is often used\r\nby astronomers for this purpose, and is called a concave mirror.\r\n\r\nThe radiant energy coming from a star or other distant object and\r\nfalling upon the silvered face of such a mirror is reflected and\r\ncondensed at a point a little in front of the mirror, and there forms an\r\nimage of the star, which may be seen with the unaided eye, if it is held\r\nin the right place, or may be examined through a magnifying glass.\r\nSimilarly, an image of the sun, a planet, or a distant terrestrial\r\nobject is formed by the mirror, which condenses at its appropriate place\r\nthe radiant energy proceeding from each and every point in the surface\r\nof the object, and this, in common phrase, produces an image of the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nAnother device more frequently used by astronomers for the production of\r\nimages (condensation of energy) is a lens which in its simplest form is\r\na round piece of glass, thick in the center and thin at the edge, with a\r\ncross section, such as is shown at _A B_ in Fig. 38. If we suppose _E G\r\nD_ to represent a small part of a wave front coming from a very distant\r\nsource of radiant energy, such as a star, this wave front will be\r\npractically a plane surface represented by the straight line _E D_, but\r\nin passing through the lens this surface will become warped, since light\r\ntravels slower in glass than in air, and the central part of the beam,\r\n_G_, in its onward motion will be retarded by the thick center of the\r\nlens, more than _E_ or _D_ will be retarded by the comparatively thin\r\nouter edges of _A B_. On the right of the lens the wave front therefore\r\nwill be transformed into a curved surface whose exact character depends\r\nupon the shape of the lens and the kind of glass of which it is made. By\r\nproperly choosing these the new wave front may be made a part of a\r\nsphere having its center at the point _F_ and the whole energy of the\r\nwave front, _E G D_, will then be condensed at _F_, because this point\r\nis equally distant from all parts of the warped wave front, and\r\ntherefore is in a position to receive them simultaneously. The distance\r\nof _F_ from _A B_ is called the focal length of the lens, and _F_ itself\r\nis called the focus. The significance of this last word (Latin, _focus_\r\n= fireplace) will become painfully apparent to the student if he will\r\nhold a common reading glass between his hand and the sun in such a way\r\nthat the focus falls upon his hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Illustrating the theory of lenses.]\r\n\r\nAll the energy transmitted by the lens in the direction _G F_ is\r\nconcentrated upon a very small area at _F_, and an image of the\r\nobject--e. g., a star, from which the light came--is formed here. Other\r\nstars situated near the one in question will also send beams of light\r\nalong slightly different directions to the lens, and these will be\r\nconcentrated, each in its appropriate place, in the _focal plane_,\r\n_F H_, passed through the focus, _F_, perpendicular to the line, _F G_,\r\nand we shall find in this plane a picture of all the stars or other\r\nobjects within the range of the lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Essential parts of a reflecting telescope.]\r\n\r\n78. TELESCOPES.--The simplest kind of telescope consists of a concave\r\nmirror to produce images, and a magnifying glass, called an _eyepiece_,\r\nthrough which to examine them; but for convenience' sake, so that the\r\nobserver may not stand in his own light, a small mirror is frequently\r\nadded to this combination, as at _H_ in Fig. 39, where the lines\r\nrepresent the directions along which the energy is propagated. By\r\nreflection from this mirror the focal plane and the images are shifted\r\nto _F_, where they may be examined from one side through the magnifying\r\nglass _E_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--A simple form of refracting telescope.]\r\n\r\nSuch a combination of parts is called a _reflecting_ telescope, while\r\none in which the images are produced by a lens or combination of lenses\r\nis called a _refracting_ telescope, the adjective having reference to\r\nthe bending, refraction, produced by the glass upon the direction in\r\nwhich the energy is propagated. The customary arrangement of parts in\r\nsuch a telescope is shown in Fig. 40, where the part marked _O_ is\r\ncalled the objective and _V E_ (the magnifying glass) is the eyepiece,\r\nor ocular, as it is sometimes called.\r\n\r\nMost objects with which we have to deal in using a telescope send to it\r\nnot light of one color only, but a mixture of light of many colors,\r\nmany different wave lengths, some of which are refracted more than\r\nothers by the glass of which the lens is composed, and in consequence of\r\nthese different amounts of refraction a single lens does not furnish a\r\nsingle image of a star, but gives a confused jumble of red and yellow\r\nand blue images much inferior in sharpness of outline (definition) to\r\nthe images made by a good concave mirror. To remedy this defect it is\r\ncustomary to make the objective of two or more pieces of glass of\r\ndifferent densities and ground to different shapes as is shown at _O_ in\r\nFig. 40. The two pieces of glass thus mounted in one frame constitute a\r\ncompound lens having its own focal plane, shown at _F_ in the figure,\r\nand similarly the lenses composing the eyepiece have a focal plane\r\nbetween the eyepiece and the objective which must also fall at _F_, and\r\nin the use of a telescope the eyepiece must be pushed out or in until\r\nits focal plane coincides with that of the objective. This process,\r\nwhich is called focusing, is what is accomplished in the ordinary opera\r\nglass by turning a screw placed between the two tubes, and it must be\r\ncarefully done with every telescope in order to obtain distinct vision.\r\n\r\n79. MAGNIFYING POWER.--The amount by which a given telescope magnifies\r\ndepends upon the focal length of the objective (or mirror) and the focal\r\nlength of the eyepiece, and is equal to the ratio of these two\r\nquantities. Thus in Fig. 40 the distance of the objective from the focal\r\nplane _F_ is about 16 times as great as the distance of the eyepiece\r\nfrom the same plane, and the magnifying power of this telescope is\r\ntherefore 16 diameters. A magnifying power of 16 diameters means that\r\nthe diameter of any object seen in the telescope looks 16 times as large\r\nas it appears without the telescope, and is nearly equivalent to saying\r\nthat the object appears only one sixteenth as far off. Sometimes the\r\nmagnifying power is assumed to be the number of times that the _area_ of\r\nan object seems increased; and since areas are proportional to the\r\nsquares of lines, the magnifying power of 16 diameters might be called\r\na power of 256. Every large telescope is provided with several eyepieces\r\nof different focal lengths, ranging from a quarter of an inch to two and\r\na half inches, which are used to furnish different magnifying powers as\r\nmay be required for the different kinds of work undertaken with the\r\ninstrument. Higher powers can be used with large telescopes than with\r\nsmall ones, but it is seldom advantageous to use with any telescope an\r\neyepiece giving a higher power than 60 diameters for each inch of\r\ndiameter of the objective.\r\n\r\nThe part played by the eyepiece in determining magnifying power will be\r\nreadily understood from the following experiment:\r\n\r\nMake a pin hole in a piece of cardboard. Bring a printed page so close\r\nto one eye that you can no longer see the letters distinctly, and then\r\nplace the pin hole between the eye and the page. The letters which were\r\nbefore blurred may now be seen plainly through the pin hole, even when\r\nthe page is brought nearer to the eye than before. As it is brought\r\nnearer, notice how the letters seem to become larger, solely because\r\nthey are nearer. A pin hole is the simplest kind of a magnifier, and the\r\neyepiece in a telescope plays the same part as does the pin hole in the\r\nexperiment; it enables the eye to be brought nearer to the image, and\r\nthe shorter the focal length of the eyepiece the nearer is the eye\r\nbrought to the image and the higher is the magnifying power.\r\n\r\n80. THE EQUATORIAL MOUNTING.--Telescopes are of all sizes, from the\r\nmodest opera glass which may be carried in the pocket and which requires\r\nno other support than the hand, to the giant which must have a special\r\nroof to shelter it and elaborate machinery to support and direct it\r\ntoward the sky. But for even the largest telescopes this machinery\r\nconsists of the following parts, which are illustrated, with exception\r\nof the last one, in the small equatorial telescope shown in Fig. 41. It\r\nis not customary to place a driving clock on so small a telescope as\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n(_a_) A supporting pier or tripod.\r\n\r\n(_b_) An axis placed parallel to the axis of the earth.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Another axis at right angles to _b_ and capable of revolving upon\r\n_b_ as an axle.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The telescope tube attached to _c_ and capable of revolving about\r\n_c_.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Graduated circles attached to _c_ and _b_ to measure the amount by\r\nwhich the telescope is turned on these axes.\r\n\r\n(_f_) A driving clock so connected with _b_ as to make _c_ (and _d_)\r\nrevolve about _b_ with an angular velocity equal and opposite to that\r\nwith which the earth turns upon its axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--A simple equatorial mounting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Equatorial mounting of the great telescope of\r\nthe Yerkes Observatory.]\r\n\r\nSuch a support is called an equatorial mounting, and the student should\r\nnote from the figure that the circles, _e_, measure the hour angle and\r\ndeclination of any star toward which the telescope is directed, and\r\nconversely if the telescope be so set that these circles indicate the\r\nhour angle and declination of any given star, the telescope will then\r\npoint toward that star. In this way it is easy to find with the\r\ntelescope any moderately bright star, even in broad daylight, although\r\nit is then absolutely invisible to the naked eye. The rotation of the\r\nearth about its axis will speedily carry the telescope away from the\r\nstar, but if the driving clock be started, its effect is to turn the\r\ntelescope toward the west just as fast as the earth's rotation carries\r\nit toward the east, and by these compensating motions to keep it\r\ndirected toward the star. In Fig. 42, which represents the largest and\r\none of the most perfect refracting telescopes ever built, let the\r\nstudent pick out and identify the several parts of the mounting above\r\ndescribed. A part of the driving clock may be seen within the head of\r\nthe pier. In Fig. 43 trace out the corresponding parts in the mounting\r\nof a reflecting telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--The reflecting telescope of the Paris\r\nObservatory.]\r\n\r\nA telescope is often only a subordinate part of some instrument or\r\napparatus, and then its style of mounting is determined by the\r\nrequirements of the special case; but when the telescope is the chief\r\nthing, and the remainder of the apparatus is subordinate to it, the\r\nequatorial mounting is almost always adopted, although sometimes the\r\narrangement of the parts is very different in appearance from any of\r\nthose shown above. Beware of the popular error that an object held close\r\nin front of a telescope can be seen by an observer at the eyepiece. The\r\nnumerous stories of astronomers who saw spiders crawling over the\r\nobjective of their telescope, and imagined they were beholding strange\r\nobjects in the sky, are all fictitious, since nothing on or near the\r\nobjective could possibly be seen through the telescope.\r\n\r\n81. PHOTOGRAPHY.--A photographic camera consists of a lens and a device\r\nfor holding at its focus a specially prepared plate or film. This plate\r\ncarries a chemical deposit which is very sensitive to the action of\r\nlight, and which may be made to preserve the imprint of any picture\r\nwhich the lens forms upon it. If such a sensitive plate is placed at the\r\nfocus of a reflecting telescope, the combination becomes a camera\r\navailable for astronomical photography, and at the present time the\r\ntendency is strong in nearly every branch of astronomical research to\r\nsubstitute the sensitive plate in place of the observer at a telescope.\r\nA refracting telescope may also be used for astronomical photography,\r\nand is very much used, but some complications occur here on account of\r\nthe resolution of the light into its constituent colors in passing\r\nthrough the objective. Fig. 44 shows such a telescope, or rather two\r\ntelescopes, one photographic, the other visual, supported side by side\r\nupon the same equatorial mounting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Photographic telescope of the Paris\r\nObservatory.]\r\n\r\nOne of the great advantages of photography is found in connection with\r\nwhat is called--\r\n\r\n82. PERSONAL EQUATION.--It is a remarkable fact, first investigated by\r\nthe German astronomer Bessel, three quarters of a century ago, that\r\nwhere extreme accuracy is required the human senses can not be\r\nimplicitly relied upon. The most skillful observers will not agree\r\nexactly in their measurement of an angle or in estimating the exact\r\ninstant at which a star crossed the meridian; the most skillful artists\r\ncan not draw identical pictures of the same object, etc.\r\n\r\nThese minor deceptions of the senses are included in the term _personal\r\nequation_, which is a famous phrase in astronomy, denoting that the\r\nobservations of any given person require to be corrected by means of\r\nsome equation involving his personality.\r\n\r\nGeneral health, digestion, nerves, fatigue, all influence the personal\r\nequation, and it was in reference to such matters that one of the most\r\neminent of living astronomers has given this description of his habits\r\nof observing:\r\n\r\n\"In order to avoid every physiological disturbance, I have adopted the\r\nrule to abstain for one or two hours before commencing observations from\r\nevery laborious occupation; never to go to the telescope with stomach\r\nloaded with food; to abstain from everything which could affect the\r\nnervous system, from narcotics and alcohol, and especially from the\r\nabuse of coffee, which I have found to be exceedingly prejudicial to the\r\naccuracy of observation.\"[3] A regimen suggestive of preparation for an\r\nathletic contest rather than for the more quiet labors of an astronomer.\r\n\r\n  [3] Schiaparelli, Osservazioni sulle Stelle Doppie.\r\n\r\n83. VISUAL AND PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK.--The photographic plate has no stomach\r\nand no nerves, and is thus free from many of the sources of error which\r\ninhere in visual observations, and in special classes of work it\r\npossesses other marked advantages, such as rapidity when many stars are\r\nto be dealt with simultaneously, permanence of record, and owing to the\r\ncumulative effect of long exposure of the plate it is possible to\r\nphotograph with a given telescope stars far too faint to be seen through\r\nit. On the other hand, the eye has the advantage in some respects, such\r\nas studying the minute details of a fairly bright object--e. g., the\r\nsurface of a planet, or the sun's corona and, for the present at least,\r\nneither method of observing can exclude the other. For a remarkable case\r\nof discordance between the results of photographic and visual\r\nobservations compare the pictures of the great nebula in the\r\nconstellation Andromeda, which are given in Chapter XIV. A partial\r\nexplanation of these discordances and other similar ones is that the eye\r\nis most strongly affected by greenish-yellow light, while the\r\nphotographic plate responds most strongly to violet light; the\r\nphotograph, therefore, represents things which the eye has little\r\ncapacity for seeing, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n84. THE SPECTROSCOPE.--In some respects the spectroscope is the exact\r\ncounterpart of the telescope. The latter condenses radiant energy and\r\nthe former disperses it. As a measuring instrument the telescope is\r\nmainly concerned with the direction from which light comes, and the\r\ndifferent colors of which that light is composed affect it only as an\r\nobstacle to be overcome in its construction. On the other hand, with the\r\nspectroscope the direction from which the radiant energy comes is of\r\nminor consequence, and the all-important consideration is the intrinsic\r\ncharacter of that radiation. What colors are present in the light and in\r\nwhat proportions? What can these colors be made to tell about the nature\r\nand condition of the body from which they come, be it sun, or star, or\r\nsome terrestrial source of light, such as an arc lamp, a candle flame,\r\nor a furnace in blast? These are some of the characteristic questions of\r\nthe spectrum analysis, and, as the name implies, they are solved by\r\nanalyzing the radiant energy into its component parts, setting down the\r\nblue light in one place, the yellow in another, the red in still\r\nanother, etc., and interpreting this array of colors by means of\r\nprinciples which we shall have to consider. Something of this process of\r\ncolor analysis may be seen in the brilliant hues shown by a soap bubble,\r\nor reflected from a piece of mother-of-pearl, and still more strikingly\r\nexhibited in the rainbow, produced by raindrops which break up the\r\nsunlight into its component colors and arrange them each in its\r\nappropriate place. Any of these natural methods of decomposing light\r\nmight be employed in the construction of a spectroscope, but in\r\nspectroscopes which are used for analyzing the light from feeble\r\nsources, such as a star, or a candle flame, a glass prism of triangular\r\ncross section is usually employed to resolve the light into its\r\ncomponent colors, which it does by refracting it as shown at the edges\r\nof the lens in Fig. 38.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Resolution of light into its component colors.]\r\n\r\nThe course of a beam of light in passing through such a prism is shown\r\nin Fig. 45. Note that the bending of the light from its original course\r\ninto a new one, which is here shown as produced by the prism, is quite\r\nsimilar to the bending shown at the edges of a lens and comes from the\r\nsame cause, the slower velocity of light in glass than in air. It takes\r\nthe light-waves as long to move over the path _A B_ in glass as over the\r\nlonger path _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, of which only the middle section lies in\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\nNot only does the prism bend the beam of light transmitted by it, but it\r\nbends in different degree light of different colors, as is shown in the\r\nfigure, where the beam at the left of the prism is supposed to be made\r\nup of a mixture of blue and red light, while at the right of the prism\r\nthe greater deviation imparted to the blue quite separates the colors,\r\nso that they fall at different places on the screen, _S S_. The compound\r\nlight has been analyzed into its constituents, and in the same way every\r\nother color would be put down at its appropriate place on the screen,\r\nand a beam of white light falling upon the prism would be resolved by it\r\ninto a sequence of colors, falling upon the screen in the order red,\r\norange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. The initial letters of\r\nthese names make the word _Roygbiv_, and by means of it their order is\r\neasily remembered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Principal parts of a spectroscope.]\r\n\r\nIf the light which is to be examined comes from a star the analysis made\r\nby the prism is complete, and when viewed through a telescope the image\r\nof the star is seen to be drawn out into a band of light, which is\r\ncalled a _spectrum_, and is red at one end and violet or blue at the\r\nother, with all the colors of the rainbow intervening in proper order\r\nbetween these extremes. Such a prism placed in front of the objective of\r\na telescope is called an objective prism, and has been used for stellar\r\nwork with marked success at the Harvard College Observatory. But if the\r\nlight to be analyzed comes from an object having an appreciable extent\r\nof surface, such as the sun or a planet, the objective prism can not be\r\nsuccessfully employed, since each point of the surface will produce its\r\nown spectrum, and these will appear in the _view telescope_ superposed\r\nand confused one with another in a very objectionable manner. To avoid\r\nthis difficulty there is placed between the prism and the source of\r\nlight an opaque screen, _S_, with a very narrow slit cut in it, through\r\nwhich all the light to be analyzed must pass and must also go through a\r\nlens, _A_, placed between the slit and the prism, as shown in Fig. 46.\r\nThe slit and lens, together with the tube in which they are usually\r\nsupported, are called a _collimator_. By this device a very limited\r\namount of light is permitted to pass from the object through the slit\r\nand lens to the prism and is there resolved into a spectrum, which is in\r\neffect a series of images of the slit in light of different colors,\r\nplaced side by side so close as to make practically a continuous ribbon\r\nof light whose width is the length of each individual picture of the\r\nslit. The length of the ribbon (dispersion) depends mainly upon the\r\nshape of the prism and the kind of glass of which it is made, and it may\r\nbe very greatly increased and the efficiency of the spectroscope\r\nenhanced by putting two, three, or more prisms in place of the single\r\none above described. When the amount of light is very great, as in the\r\ncase of the sun or an electric arc lamp, it is advantageous to alter\r\nslightly the arrangement of the spectroscope and to substitute in place\r\nof the prism a grating--i. e., a metallic mirror with a great number of\r\nfine parallel lines ruled upon its surface at equal intervals, one from\r\nanother. It is by virtue of such a system of fine parallel grooves that\r\nmother-of-pearl displays its beautiful color effects, and a brilliant\r\nspectrum of great purity and high dispersion is furnished by a grating\r\nruled with from 10,000 to 20,000 lines to the inch. Fig. 47 represents,\r\nrather crudely, a part of the spectrum of an arc light furnished by such\r\na grating, or rather it shows three different spectra arranged side by\r\nside, and looking something like a rude ladder. The sides of the ladder\r\nare the spectra furnished by the incandescent carbons of the lamp, and\r\nthe cross pieces are the spectrum of the electric arc filling the space\r\nbetween the carbons. Fig. 48 shows a continuation of the same spectra\r\ninto a region where the radiant energy is invisible to the eye, but is\r\ncapable of being photographed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Green and blue part of the spectrum of an\r\nelectric arc light.]\r\n\r\nIt is only when a lens is placed between the lamp and the slit of the\r\nspectroscope that the three spectra are shown distinct from each other\r\nas in the figure. The purpose of the lens is to make a picture of the\r\nlamp upon the slit, so that all the radiant energy from any one point of\r\nthe arc may be brought to one part of the slit, and thus appear in the\r\nresulting spectrum separated from the energy which comes from every\r\nother part of the arc. Such an instrument is called an _analyzing\r\nspectroscope_ while one without the lens is called an _integrating\r\nspectroscope_, since it furnishes to each point of the slit a sample of\r\nthe radiant energy coming from every part of the source of light, and\r\nthus produces only an average spectrum of that source without\r\ndistinction of its parts. When a spectroscope is attached to a\r\ntelescope, as is often done (see Fig. 49), the eyepiece is removed to\r\nmake way for it, and the telescope objective takes the part of the\r\nanalyzing lens. A camera is frequently combined with such an apparatus\r\nto photograph the spectra it furnishes, and the whole instrument is then\r\ncalled a _spectrograph_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Violet and ultraviolet parts of spectrum of an\r\narc lamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--A spectroscope attached to the Yerkes\r\ntelescope.]\r\n\r\n85. SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.--Having seen the mechanism of the spectroscope by\r\nwhich the light incident upon it is resolved into its constituent parts\r\nand drawn out into a series of colors arranged in the order of their\r\nwave lengths, we have now to consider the interpretation which is to be\r\nplaced upon the various kinds of spectra which may be seen, and here we\r\nrely upon the experience of physicists and chemists, from whom we learn\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe radiant energy which is analyzed by the spectroscope has its source\r\nin the atoms and molecules which make up the luminous body from which\r\nthe energy is radiated, and these atoms and molecules are able to\r\nimpress upon the ether their own peculiarities in the shape of waves of\r\ndifferent length and amplitude. We have seen that by varying the\r\nconditions of the experiment different kinds of waves may be produced in\r\na bucket of water; and as a study of these waves might furnish an index\r\nto the conditions which produced them, so the study of the waves\r\npeculiar to the light which comes from any source may be made to give\r\ninformation about the molecules which make up that source. Thus the\r\nmolecules of iron produce a system of waves peculiar to themselves and\r\nwhich can be duplicated by nothing else, and every other substance gives\r\noff its own peculiar type of energy, presenting a limited and definite\r\nnumber of wave lengths dependent upon the nature and condition of its\r\nmolecules. If these molecules are free to behave in their own\r\ncharacteristic fashion without disturbance or crowding, they emit light\r\nof these wave lengths only, and we find in the spectrum a series of\r\nbright lines, pictures of the slit produced by light of these particular\r\nwave lengths, while between these bright lines lie dark spaces showing\r\nthe absence from the radiant energy of light of intermediate wave\r\nlengths. Such a spectrum is shown in the central portion of Fig. 47,\r\nwhich, as we have already seen, is produced by the space between the\r\ncarbons of the arc lamp. On the other hand, if the molecules are closely\r\npacked together under pressure they so interfere with each other as to\r\ngive off a jumble of energy of all wave lengths, and this is translated\r\nby the spectroscope into a continuous ribbon of light with no dark\r\nspaces intervening, as in the upper and lower parts of Figs. 47 and 48,\r\nproduced by the incandescent solid carbons of the lamp. These two types\r\nare known as the continuous and discontinuous spectrum, and we may lay\r\ndown the following principle regarding them:\r\n\r\nA discontinuous spectrum, or bright-line spectrum as it is familiarly\r\ncalled, indicates that the molecules of the source of light are not\r\ncrowded together, and therefore the light must come from an incandescent\r\ngas. A continuous spectrum shows only that the molecules are crowded\r\ntogether, or are so numerous that the body to which they belong is not\r\ntransparent and gives no further information. The body may be solid,\r\nliquid, or gaseous, but in the latter case the gas must be under\r\nconsiderable pressure or of great extent.\r\n\r\nA second principle is: The lines which appear in a spectrum are\r\ncharacteristic of the source from which the light came--e. g., the\r\ndouble line in the yellow part of the spectrum at the extreme left in\r\nFig. 47 is produced by sodium vapor in and around the electric arc and\r\nis never produced by anything but sodium. When by laboratory experiments\r\nwe have learned the particular set of lines corresponding to iron, we\r\nmay treat the presence of these lines in another spectrum as proof that\r\niron is present in the source from which the light came, whether that\r\nsource be a white-hot poker in the next room or a star immeasurably\r\ndistant. The evidence that iron is present lies in the nature of the\r\nlight, and there is no reason to suppose that nature to be altered on\r\nthe way from star to earth. It may, however, be altered by something\r\nhappening to the source from which it comes--e. g., changing temperature\r\nor pressure may affect, and does affect, the spectrum which such a\r\nsubstance as iron emits, and we must be prepared to find the same\r\nsubstance presenting different spectra under different conditions, only\r\nthese conditions must be greatly altered in order to produce radical\r\nchanges in the spectrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--The chief lines in the spectrum of\r\nsunlight.--HERSCHEL.]\r\n\r\n86. WAVE LENGTHS.--To identify a line as belonging to and produced by\r\niron or any other substance, its position in the spectrum--i. e., its\r\nwave length--must be very accurately determined, and for the\r\nidentification of a substance by means of its spectrum it is often\r\nnecessary to determine accurately the wave lengths of many lines. A\r\ncomplicated spectrum may consist of hundreds or thousands of lines, due\r\nto the presence of many different substances in the source of light, and\r\nunless great care is taken in assigning the exact position of these\r\nlines in the spectrum, confusion and wrong identifications are sure to\r\nresult. For the measurement of the required wave length a tenth meter\r\n(§ 75) is the unit employed, and a scale of wave lengths expressed in\r\nthis unit is presented in Fig. 50. The accuracy with which some of these\r\nwave lengths are determined is truly astounding; a ten-billionth of an\r\ninch! These numerical wave lengths save all necessity for referring to\r\nthe color of any part of the spectrum, and pictures of spectra for\r\nscientific use are not usually printed in colors.\r\n\r\n87. ABSORPTION SPECTRA.--There is another kind of spectrum, of greater\r\nimportance than either of those above considered, which is well\r\nillustrated by the spectrum of sunlight (Fig. 50). This is a nearly\r\ncontinuous spectrum crossed by numerous _dark_ lines due to absorption\r\nof radiant energy in a comparatively cool gas through which it passes on\r\nits way to the spectroscope. Fraunhofer, who made the first careful\r\nstudy of spectra, designated some of the more conspicuous of these lines\r\nby letters of the alphabet which are shown in the plate, and which are\r\nstill in common use as names for the lines, not only in the spectrum of\r\nsunlight but wherever they occur in other spectra. Thus the double line\r\nmarked _D_, wave length 5893, falls at precisely the same place in the\r\nspectrum as does the double (sodium) line which we have already seen in\r\nthe yellow part of the arc-light spectrum, which line is also called _D_\r\nand bears a very intimate relation to the dark _D_ line of the solar\r\nspectrum.\r\n\r\nThe student who has access to colored crayons should color one edge of\r\nFig. 50 in accordance with the lettering there given and, so far as\r\npossible, he should make the transition from one color to the next a\r\ngradual one, as it is in the rainbow.\r\n\r\nFig. 50 is far from being a complete representation of the spectrum of\r\nsunlight. Not only does this spectrum extend both to the right and to\r\nthe left into regions invisible to the human eye, but within the limits\r\nof the figure, instead of the seventy-five lines there shown, there are\r\nliterally thousands upon thousands of lines, of which only the most\r\nconspicuous can be shown in such a cut as this.\r\n\r\nThe dark lines which appear in the spectrum of sunlight can, under\r\nproper conditions, be made to appear in the spectrum of an arc light,\r\nand Fig. 51 shows a magnified representation of a small part of such a\r\nspectrum adjacent to the _D_ (sodium) lines. Down the middle of each of\r\nthese lines runs a black streak whose position (wave length) is\r\nprecisely that of the _D_ lines in the spectrum of sunlight, and whose\r\npresence is explained as follows:\r\n\r\nThe very hot sodium vapor at the center of the arc gives off its\r\ncharacteristic light, which, shining through the outer and cooler layers\r\nof sodium vapor, is partially absorbed by these, resulting in a fine\r\ndark line corresponding exactly in position and wave length to the\r\nbright lines, and seen against these as a background, since the higher\r\ntemperature at the center of the arc tends to broaden the bright lines\r\nand make them diffuse. Similarly the dark lines in the spectrum of the\r\nsun (Fig. 50) point to the existence of a surrounding envelope of\r\nrelatively cool gases, which absorb from the sunlight precisely those\r\nkinds of radiant energy which they would themselves emit if\r\nincandescent. The resulting dark lines in the spectrum are to be\r\ninterpreted by the same set of principles which we have above applied to\r\nthe bright lines of a discontinuous spectrum, and they may be used to\r\ndetermine the chemical composition of the sun, just as the bright lines\r\nserve to determine the chemical elements present in the electric arc.\r\nWith reference to the mode of their formation, bright-line and dark-line\r\nspectra are sometimes called respectively _emission_ and _absorption_\r\nspectra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--The lines reversed.]\r\n\r\n88. TYPES OF SPECTRUM.--The sun presents by far the most complex\r\nspectrum known, and Fig. 50 shows only a small number of the more\r\nconspicuous lines which appear in it. Spectra of stars, _per contra_,\r\nappear relatively simple, since their feeble light is insufficient to\r\nbring out faint details. In Chapters XIII and XIV there are shown types\r\nof the different kinds of spectra given by starlight, and these are to\r\nbe interpreted by the principles above established. Thus the spectrum of\r\nthe bright star [b] Aurigæ shows a continuous spectrum crossed by a few\r\nheavy absorption lines which are known from laboratory experiments to be\r\nproduced only by hydrogen. There must therefore be an atmosphere of\r\nrelatively cool hydrogen surrounding this star. The spectrum of Pollux\r\nis quite similar to that of the sun and is to be interpreted as showing\r\na physical condition similar to that of the sun, while the spectrum of\r\n[a] Herculis is quite different from either of the others. In subsequent\r\nchapters we shall have occasion to consider more fully these different\r\ntypes of spectrum.\r\n\r\n89. THE DOPPLER PRINCIPLE.--This important principle of the spectrum\r\nanalysis is most readily appreciated through the following experiment:\r\n\r\nListen to the whistle of a locomotive rapidly approaching, and observe\r\nhow the pitch changes and the note becomes more grave as the locomotive\r\npasses by and commences to recede. During the approach of the whistle\r\neach successive sound wave has a shorter distance to travel in coming to\r\nthe ear of the listener than had its predecessor, and in consequence the\r\nwaves appear to come in quicker succession, producing a higher note with\r\na correspondingly shorter wave length than would be heard if the same\r\nwhistle were blown with the locomotive at rest. On the other hand, the\r\nwave length is increased and the pitch of the note lowered by the\r\nreceding motion of the whistle. A similar effect is produced upon the\r\nwave length of light by a rapid change of distance between the source\r\nfrom which it comes and the instrument which receives it, so that a\r\ndiminishing distance diminishes very slightly the wave length of every\r\nline in the spectrum produced by the light, and an increasing distance\r\nincreases these wave lengths, and this holds true whether the change of\r\ndistance is produced by motion of the source of light or by motion of\r\nthe instrument which receives it.\r\n\r\nThis change of wave length is sometimes described by saying that when a\r\nbody is rapidly approaching, the lines of its spectrum are all displaced\r\ntoward the violet end of the spectrum, and are correspondingly displaced\r\ntoward the red end by a receding motion. The amount of this shifting,\r\nwhen it can be measured, measures the velocity of the body along the\r\nline of sight, but the observations are exceedingly delicate, and it is\r\nonly in recent years that it has been found possible to make them with\r\nprecision. For this purpose there is made to pass through the\r\nspectroscope light from an artificial source which contains one or more\r\nchemical elements known to be present in the star which is to be\r\nobserved, and the corresponding lines in the spectrum of this light and\r\nin the spectrum of the star are examined to determine whether they\r\nexactly match in position, or show, as they sometimes do, a slight\r\ndisplacement, as if one spectrum had been slipped past the other. The\r\ndifficulty of the observations lies in the extremely small amount of\r\nthis slipping, which rarely if ever in the case of a moving star amounts\r\nto one sixth part of the interval between the close parallel lines\r\nmarked _D_ in Fig. 50. The spectral lines furnished by the headlight of\r\na locomotive running at the rate of a hundred miles per hour would be\r\ndisplaced by this motion less than one six-thousandth part of the space\r\nbetween the _D_ lines, an amount absolutely imperceptible in the most\r\npowerful spectroscope yet constructed. But many of the celestial bodies\r\nhave velocities so much greater than a hundred miles per hour that these\r\nmay be detected and measured by means of the Doppler principle.\r\n\r\n90. OTHER INSTRUMENTS.--Other instruments of importance to the\r\nastronomer, but of which only casual mention can here be made, are the\r\nmeridian-circle; the transit, one form of which is shown in Fig. 52, and\r\nthe zenith telescope, which furnish refined methods for making\r\nobservations similar in kind to those which the student has already\r\nlearned to make with plumb line and protractor; the sextant, which is\r\npre-eminently the sailor's instrument for finding the latitude and\r\nlongitude at sea, by measuring the altitudes of sun and stars above the\r\nsea horizon; the heliometer, which serves for the very accurate\r\nmeasurement of small angles, such as the angular distance between two\r\nstars not more than one or two degrees apart; and the photometer, which\r\nis used for measuring the amount of light received from the celestial\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--A combined transit instrument and zenith\r\ntelescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\n91. RESULTS OF OBSERVATION WITH THE UNAIDED EYE.--The student who has\r\nmade the observations of the moon which are indicated in Chapter III has\r\nin hand data from which much may be learned about the earth's satellite.\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature brought out by them is the motion of\r\nthe moon among the stars, always from west toward east, accompanied by\r\nthat endless series of changes in shape and brightness--new moon, first\r\nquarter, full moon, etc.--whose successive stages we represent by the\r\nwords, the phase of the moon. From his own observation the student\r\nshould be able to verify, at least approximately, the following\r\nstatements, although the degree of numerical precision contained in some\r\nof them can be reached only by more elaborate apparatus and longer study\r\nthan he has given to the subject:\r\n\r\nA. The phase of the moon depends upon the distance apart of sun and moon\r\nin the sky, new moon coming when they are together, and full moon when\r\nthey are as far apart as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOON, ONE DAY AFTER FIRST QUARTER. From a photograph\r\nmade at the Paris Observatory.]\r\n\r\nB. The moon is essentially a round, dark body, giving off no light of\r\nits own, but shining solely by reflected sunlight. The proof of this is\r\nthat whenever we see a part of the moon which is turned away from the\r\nsun it looks dark--e. g., at new moon, sun and moon are in nearly the\r\nsame direction from us and we see little or nothing of the moon, since\r\nthe side upon which the sun shines is turned away from us. At full moon\r\nthe earth is in line between sun and moon, and we see, round and\r\nbright, the face upon which the sun shines. At other phases, such as the\r\nquarters, the moon turns toward the earth a part of its night hemisphere\r\nand a part of its day hemisphere, but in general only that part which\r\nbelongs to the day side of the moon is visible and the peculiar curved\r\nline which forms the boundary--the \"ragged edge,\" or _terminator_, as it\r\nis called, is the dividing line between day and night upon the moon.\r\n\r\nA partial exception to what precedes is found for a few days after new\r\nmoon when the moon and sun are not very far apart in the sky, for then\r\nthe whole round disk of the moon may often be seen, a small part of it\r\nbrightly illuminated by the sun and the larger part feebly illuminated\r\nby sunlight which fell first upon the earth and was by it reflected back\r\nto the moon, giving the pleasing effect which is sometimes called the\r\nold moon in the new moon's arms. The new moon--i. e., the part illumined\r\nby the sun--usually appears to belong to a sphere of larger radius than\r\nthe old moon, but this is purely a trick played by the eyes of the\r\nobserver, and the effect disappears altogether in a telescope. Is there\r\nany similar effect in the few days before new moon?\r\n\r\nC. The moon makes the circuit of the sky from a given star around to the\r\nsame star again in a little more than 27 days (27.32166), but the\r\ninterval between successive new moons--i. e., from the sun around to the\r\nsun again--is more than 29 days (29.53059). This last interval, which is\r\ncalled a lunar month or _synodical_ month, indicates what we have\r\nlearned before--that the sun has changed its place among the stars\r\nduring the month, so that it takes the moon an extra two days to\r\novertake him after having made the circuit of the sky, just as it takes\r\nthe minute hand of a clock an extra 5 minutes to catch up with the hour\r\nhand after having made a complete circuit of the dial.\r\n\r\nD. Wherever the moon may be in the sky, it turns always the same face\r\ntoward the earth, as is shown by the fact that the dark markings which\r\nappear on its surface stand always upon (nearly) the same part of its\r\ndisk. It does not always turn the same face toward the sun, for the\r\nboundary line between the illumined and unillumined parts of the moon\r\nshifts from one side to the other as the phase changes, dividing at each\r\nmoment day from night upon the moon and illustrating by its slow\r\nprogress that upon the moon the day and the month are of equal length\r\n(29.5 terrestrial days), instead of being time units of different\r\nlengths as with us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Motion of moon and earth relative to the sun.]\r\n\r\n92. THE MOON'S MOTION.--The student should compare the results of his\r\nown observations, as well as the preceding section, with Fig. 53, in\r\nwhich the lines with dates printed on them are all supposed to radiate\r\nfrom the sun and to represent the direction from the sun of earth and\r\nmoon upon the given dates which are arbitrarily assumed for the sake of\r\nillustration, any other set would do equally well. The black dots, small\r\nand large, represent the moon revolving about the earth, but having the\r\ncircular path shown in Fig. 34 (ellipse) transformed by the earth's\r\nforward motion into the peculiar sinuous line here shown. With respect\r\nto both earth and sun, the moon's orbit deviates but little from a\r\ncircle, since the sinuous curve of Fig. 53 follows very closely the\r\nearth's orbit around the sun and is almost identical with it. For\r\nclearness of representation the distance between earth and moon in the\r\nfigure has been made ten times too great, and to get a proper idea of\r\nthe moon's orbit with reference to the sun, we must suppose the moon\r\nmoved up toward the earth until its distance from the line of the\r\nearth's orbit is only a tenth part of what it is in the figure. When\r\nthis is done, the moon's path becomes almost indistinguishable from that\r\nof the earth, as may be seen in the figure, where the attempt has been\r\nmade to show both lines, and it is to be especially noted that this\r\nreal orbit of the moon is everywhere concave toward the sun.\r\n\r\nThe phase presented by the moon at different parts of its path is\r\nindicated by the row of circles at the right, and the student should\r\nshow why a new moon is associated with June 30th and a full moon with\r\nJuly 15th, etc. What was the date of first quarter? Third quarter?\r\n\r\nWe may find in Fig. 53 another effect of the same kind as that noted\r\nabove in C. Between noon, June 30th, and noon, July 3d, the earth makes\r\nupon its axis three complete revolutions with respect to the sun, but\r\nthe meridian which points toward the moon at noon on June 30th will not\r\npoint toward it at noon on July 3d, since the moon has moved into a new\r\nposition and is now 37° away from the meridian. Verify this statement by\r\nmeasuring, in Fig. 53, with the protractor, the moon's angular distance\r\nfrom the meridian at noon on July 3d. When will the meridian overtake\r\nthe moon?\r\n\r\n93. HARVEST MOON.--The interval between two successive transits of the\r\nmeridian past the moon is called a lunar day, and the student should\r\nshow from the figure that on the average a lunar day is 51 minutes\r\nlonger than a solar day--i. e., upon the average each day the moon comes\r\nto the meridian 51 minutes of solar time later than on the day before.\r\nIt is also true that on the average the moon rises and sets 51 minutes\r\nlater each day than on the day before. But there is a good deal of\r\nirregularity in the retardation of the time of moonrise and moonset,\r\nsince the time of rising depends largely upon the particular point of\r\nthe horizon at which the moon appears, and between two days this point\r\nmay change so much on account of the moon's orbital motion as to make\r\nthe retardation considerably greater or less than its average value. In\r\nnorthern latitudes this effect is particularly marked in the month of\r\nSeptember, when the eastern horizon is nearly parallel with the moon's\r\napparent path in the sky, and near the time of full moon in that month\r\nthe moon rises on several successive nights at nearly the same hour, and\r\nin less degree the same is true for October. This highly convenient\r\narrangement of moonlight has caused the full moons of these two months\r\nto be christened respectively the Harvest Moon and the Hunter's Moon.\r\n\r\n94. SIZE AND MASS OF THE MOON.--It has been shown in Chapter I how the\r\ndistance of the moon from the earth may be measured and its diameter\r\ndetermined by means of angles, and without enlarging upon the details of\r\nthese observations, we note as their result that the moon is a globe\r\n2,163 miles in diameter, and distant from the earth on the average about\r\n240,000 miles. But, as we have seen in Chapter VII, this distance\r\nchanges to the extent of a few thousand miles, sometimes less, sometimes\r\ngreater, mainly on account of the elliptic shape of the moon's orbit\r\nabout the earth, but also in part from the disturbing influence of other\r\nbodies, such as the sun, which pull the moon to and fro, backward and\r\nforward, to quite an appreciable extent.\r\n\r\nFrom the known diameter of the moon it is a matter of elementary\r\ngeometry to derive in miles the area of its surface and its volume or\r\nsolid contents. Leaving this as an exercise for the student, we adopt\r\nthe earth as the standard of comparison and find that the diameter of\r\nthe moon is rather more than a quarter, 4/15, that of the earth, the\r\narea of its surface is a trifle more than 1/14 that of the earth, and\r\nits volume a little more than 1/49 of the earth's. So much is pure\r\ngeometry, but we may combine with it some mechanical principles which\r\nenable us to go a step farther and to \"weigh\" the moon--i. e., determine\r\nits mass and the average density of the material of which it is made.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the moon moves around the sun in a path differing but\r\nlittle from the smooth curve shown in Fig. 53, with arrows indicating\r\nthe direction of motion, and it would follow absolutely such a smooth\r\npath were it not for the attraction of the earth, and in less degree of\r\nsome of the other planets, which swing it about first to one side then\r\nto the other. But action and reaction are equal; the moon pulls as\r\nstrongly upon the earth as does the earth upon the moon, and if earth\r\nand moon were of equal mass, the deviation of the earth from the smooth\r\ncurve in the figure would be just as large as that of the moon. It is\r\nshown in the figure that the moon does displace the earth from this\r\ncurve, and we have only to measure the amount of this displacement of\r\nthe earth and compare it with the displacement suffered by the moon to\r\nfind how much the mass of the one exceeds that of the other. It may be\r\nseen from the figure that at first quarter, about July 7th, the earth is\r\nthrust ahead in the direction of its orbital motion, while at the third\r\nquarter, July 22d, it is pulled back by the action of the moon, and at\r\nall times it is more or less displaced by this action, so that, in order\r\nto be strictly correct, we must amend our former statement about the\r\nmoon moving around the earth and make it read, Both earth and moon\r\nrevolve around a point on line between their centers. This point is\r\ncalled their _center of gravity_, and the earth and the moon both move\r\nin ellipses having this center of gravity at their common focus. Compare\r\nthis with Kepler's First Law. These ellipses are similarly shaped, but\r\nof very different size, corresponding to Newton's third law of motion\r\n(Chapter IV), so that the action of the earth in causing the small moon\r\nto move around a large orbit is just equal to the reaction of the moon\r\nin causing the larger earth to move in the smaller orbit. This is\r\nequivalent to saying that the dimensions of the two orbits are inversely\r\nproportional to the masses of the earth and the moon.\r\n\r\nBy observing throughout the month the direction from the earth to the\r\nsun or to a near planet, such as Mars or Venus, astronomers have\r\ndetermined that the diameter of the ellipse in which the earth moves is\r\nabout 5,850 miles, so that the distance of the earth from the center of\r\ngravity is 2,925 miles, and the distance of the moon from it is\r\n240,000-2,925 = 237,075. We may now write in the form of a proportion--\r\n\r\n    Mass of earth : Mass of moon :: 237,075 : 2,925,\r\n\r\nand find from it that the mass of the earth is 81 times as great as the\r\nmass of the moon--i. e., leaving kind and quality out of account, there\r\nis enough material in the earth to make 81 moons. We may note in this\r\nconnection that the diameter of the earth, 7,926 miles, is greater than\r\nthe diameter of the monthly orbit in which the moon causes it to move,\r\nand therefore the center of gravity of earth and moon always lies inside\r\nthe body of the earth, about 1,000 miles below the surface.\r\n\r\n95. DENSITY OF THE MOON.--It is believed that in a general way the moon\r\nis made of much the same kind of material which goes to make up the\r\nearth--metals, minerals, rocks, etc.--and a part of the evidence upon\r\nwhich this belief is based lies in the density of the moon. By density\r\nof a substance we mean the amount of it which is contained in a given\r\nvolume--i. e., the weight of a bushel or a cubic centimeter of the\r\nstuff. The density of chalk is twice as great as the density of water,\r\nbecause a cubic centimeter of chalk weighs twice as much as an equal\r\nvolume of water, and similarly in other cases the density is found by\r\ndividing the mass or weight of the body by the mass or weight of an\r\nequal volume of water.\r\n\r\nWe know the mass of the earth (§ 45), and knowing the mass of a cubic\r\nfoot of water, it is easy, although a trifle tedious, to compute what\r\nwould be the mass of a volume of water equal in size to the earth. The\r\nquotient obtained by dividing one of these masses by the other (mass of\r\nearth ÷ mass of water) is the average density of the material composing\r\nthe earth, and we find numerically that this is 5.6--i. e., it would\r\ntake 5.6 water earths to attract as strongly as does the real one. From\r\ndirect experiment we know that the average density of the principal\r\nrocks which make up the crust of the earth is only about half of this,\r\nshowing that the deep-lying central parts of the earth are denser than\r\nthe surface parts, as we should expect them to be, because they have to\r\nbear the weight of all that lies above them and are compressed by it.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the moon, we find in the same way as for the earth that\r\nits average density is 3.4 as great as that of water.\r\n\r\n96. FORCE OF GRAVITY UPON THE MOON.--This number, 3.4, compared with the\r\n5.6 which we found for the earth, shows that on the whole the moon is\r\nmade of lighter stuff than is the body of the earth, and this again is\r\nmuch what we should expect to find, for weight, the force which tends to\r\ncompress the substance of the moon, is less there than here. The weight\r\nof a cubic yard of rock at the surface of either earth or moon is the\r\nforce with which the earth or moon attracts it, and this by the law of\r\ngravitation is for the earth--\r\n\r\n    W = k × (m m´) / (3963)^{2};\r\n\r\nand for the moon--\r\n\r\n    w = k × {m (m´/81)} / (1081)^{2};\r\n\r\nfrom which we find by division--\r\n\r\n    w = (W / 81) (3963 / 1081)^{2} = (W / 6) (approximately).\r\n\r\nThe cubic yard of rock, which upon the earth weighs two tons, would, if\r\ntransported to the moon, weigh only one third of a ton, and would have\r\nonly one sixth as much influence in compressing the rocks below it as it\r\nhad upon the earth. Note that this rock when transported to the moon\r\nwould be still attracted by the earth and would have weight toward the\r\nearth, but it is not this of which we are speaking; by its weight in\r\nthe moon we mean the force with which the moon attracts it. Making due\r\nallowance for the difference in compression produced by weight, we may\r\nsay that in general, so far as density goes, the moon is very like a\r\npiece of the earth of equal mass set off by itself alone.\r\n\r\n97. ALBEDO.--In another respect the lunar stuff is like that of which\r\nthe earth is made: it reflects the sunlight in much the same way and to\r\nthe same amount. The contrast of light and dark areas on the moon's\r\nsurface shows, as we shall see in another section, the presence of\r\ndifferent substances upon the moon which reflect the sunlight in\r\ndifferent degrees. This capacity for reflecting a greater or less\r\npercentage of the incident sunlight is called _albedo_ (Latin,\r\nwhiteness), and the brilliancy of the full moon might lead one to\r\nsuppose that its albedo is very great, like that of snow or those masses\r\nof summer cloud which we call thunderheads. But this is only an effect\r\nof contrast with the dark background of the sky. The same moon by day\r\nlooks pale, and its albedo is, in fact, not very different from that of\r\nour common rocks--weather-beaten sandstone according to Sir John\r\nHerschel--so that it would be possible to build an artificial moon of\r\nrock or brick which would shine in the sunlight much as does the real\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced by the differences of albedo upon the moon's face is\r\ncommonly called the \"man in the moon,\" but, like the images presented by\r\nglowing coals, the face in the moon is anything which we choose to make\r\nit. Among the Chinese it is said to be a monkey pounding rice; in India,\r\na rabbit; in Persia, the earth reflected as in a mirror, etc.\r\n\r\n98. LIBRATIONS.--We have already learned that the moon turns always the\r\nsame face toward the earth, and we have now to modify this statement and\r\nto find that here, as in so many other cases, the thing we learn first\r\nis only approximately true and needs to be limited or added to or\r\nmodified in some way. In general, Nature is too complex to be completely\r\nunderstood at first sight or to be perfectly represented by a simple\r\nstatement. In Fig. 55 we have two photographs of the moon, taken nearly\r\nthree years apart, the right-hand one a little after first quarter and\r\nthe left-hand one a little before third quarter. They therefore\r\nrepresent different parts of the moon's surface, but along the ragged\r\nedge the same region is shown on both photographs, and features common\r\nto both pictures may readily be found--e. g., the three rings which form\r\na right-angled triangle about one third of the way down from the top of\r\nthe cut, and the curved mountain chain just below these. If the moon\r\nturned exactly the same face toward us in the two pictures, the distance\r\nof any one of these markings from any part of the moon's edge must be\r\nthe same in both pictures; but careful measurement will show that this\r\nis not the case, and that in the left-hand picture the upper edge of the\r\nmoon is tipped toward us and the lower edge away from us, as if the\r\nwhole moon had been rotated slightly about a horizontal line and must be\r\nturned back a little (about 7°) in order to match perfectly the other\r\npart of the picture.\r\n\r\nThis turning is called a _libration_, and it should be borne in mind\r\nthat the moon librates not only in the direction above measured, north\r\nand south, but also at right angles to this, east and west, so that we\r\nare able to see a little farther around every part of the moon's edge\r\nthan would be possible if it turned toward us at all times exactly the\r\nsame face. But in spite of the librations there remains on the farther\r\nside of the moon an area of 6,000,000 square miles which is forever\r\nhidden from us, and of whose character we have no direct knowledge,\r\nalthough there is no reason to suppose it very different from that which\r\nis visible, despite the fact that some of the books contain quaint\r\nspeculations to the contrary. The continent of South America is just\r\nabout equal in extent to this unknown region, while North America is a\r\nfair equivalent for all the rest of the moon's surface, both those\r\ncentral parts which are constantly visible, and the zone around the edge\r\nwhose parts sometimes come into sight and are sometimes hidden.\r\n\r\nAn interesting consequence of the peculiar rotation of the moon is that\r\nfrom our side of it the earth is always visible. Sun, stars, and planets\r\nrise and set there as well as here, but to an observer on the moon the\r\nearth swings always overhead, shifting its position a few degrees one\r\nway or the other on account of the libration but running through its\r\nsuccession of phases, new earth, first quarter, etc., without ever going\r\nbelow the horizon, provided the observer is anywhere near the center of\r\nthe moon's disk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Illustrating the moon's rotation.]\r\n\r\n99. CAUSE OF LIBRATIONS.--That the moon should librate is by no means so\r\nremarkable a fact as that it should at all times turn very nearly the\r\nsame face toward the earth. This latter fact can have but one meaning:\r\nthe moon revolves about an axis as does the earth, but the time required\r\nfor this revolution is just equal to the time required to make a\r\nrevolution in its orbit. Place two coins upon a table with their heads\r\nturned toward the north, as in Fig. 54, and move the smaller one around\r\nthe larger in such a way that its face shall always look away from the\r\nlarger one. In making one revolution in its orbit the head on this small\r\ncoin will be successively directed toward every point of the compass,\r\nand when it returns to its initial position the small coin will have\r\nmade just one revolution about an axis perpendicular to the plane of its\r\norbit. In no other way can it be made to face always away from the\r\nfigure at the center of its orbit while moving around it.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to understand the moon's librations, for, if\r\nthe small coin at any time moves faster or slower in its orbit than it\r\nturns about its axis, a new side will be turned toward the center, and\r\nthe same may happen if the central coin itself shifts into a new\r\nposition. This is what happens to the moon, for its orbital motion, like\r\nthat of Mercury (Fig. 17), is alternately fast and slow, and in addition\r\nto this there are present other minor influences, such as the fact that\r\nits rotation axis is not exactly perpendicular to the plane of its\r\norbit; in addition to this the observer upon the earth is daily carried\r\nby its rotation from one point of view to another, etc., so that it is\r\nonly in a general way that the rotation upon the axis and motion in the\r\norbit keep pace with each other. In a general way a cable keeps a ship\r\nanchored in the same place, although wind and waves may cause it to\r\n\"librate\" about the anchor.\r\n\r\nHow the moon came to have this exact equality between its times of\r\nrevolution and rotation constitutes a chapter of its history upon which\r\nwe shall not now enter; but the equality having once been established,\r\nthe mechanism by which it is preserved is simple enough.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of the earth for the moon has very slightly pulled the\r\nlatter out of shape (§ 42), so that the particular diameter, which\r\npoints toward the earth, is a little longer than any other, and thus\r\nserves as a handle which the earth lays hold of and pulls down into its\r\nlowest possible position--i. e., the position in which it points toward\r\nthe center of the earth. Just how long this handle is, remains unknown,\r\nbut it may be shown from the law of gravitation that less than a hundred\r\nyards of elongation would suffice for the work it has to do.\r\n\r\n100. THE MOON AS A WORLD.--Thus far we have considered the moon as a\r\nsatellite of the earth, dependent upon the earth, and interesting\r\nchiefly because of its relation to it. But the moon is something more\r\nthan this; it is a world in itself, very different from the earth,\r\nalthough not wholly unlike it. The most characteristic feature of the\r\nearth's surface is its division into land and water, and nothing of this\r\nkind can be found upon the moon. It is true that the first generation of\r\nastronomers who studied the moon with telescopes fancied that the large\r\ndark patches shown in Fig. 55 were bodies of water, and named them\r\noceans, seas, lakes, and ponds, and to the present day we keep those\r\nnames, although it is long since recognized that these parts of the\r\nmoon's surface are as dry as any other. Their dark appearance indicates\r\na different kind of material from that composing the lighter parts of\r\nthe moon, material with a different albedo, just as upon the earth we\r\nhave light-colored and dark-colored rocks, marble and slate, which seen\r\nfrom the moon must present similar contrasts of brightness. Although\r\nthese dark patches are almost the only features distinguishable with the\r\nunaided eye, it is far otherwise in the telescope or the photograph,\r\nespecially along the ragged edge where great numbers of rings can be\r\nseen, which are apparently depressions in the moon and are called\r\ncraters. These we find in great number all over the moon, but, as the\r\nfigure shows, they are seen to the best advantage near the\r\n_terminator_--i. e., the dividing line between day and night, since the\r\nlong shadows cast here by the rising or setting sun bring out the\r\ndetails of the surface better than elsewhere. Carefully examine Fig. 55\r\nwith reference to these features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--The moon at first and last quarter. Lick\r\nObservatory photographs.]\r\n\r\nAnother feature which exists upon both earth and moon, although far less\r\ncommon there than here, is illustrated in the chain of mountains visible\r\nnear the terminator, a little above the center of the moon in both parts\r\nof Fig. 55. This particular range of mountains, which is called the\r\nLunar Apennines, is by far the most prominent one upon the moon,\r\nalthough others, the Alps and Caucasus, exist. But for the most part the\r\nlunar mountains stand alone, each by itself, instead of being grouped\r\ninto ranges, as on the earth. Note in the figure that some of the lunar\r\nmountains stretch out into the night side of the moon, their peaks\r\nprojecting up into the sunlight, and thus becoming visible, while the\r\nlowlands are buried in the shadow.\r\n\r\nA subordinate feature of the moon's surface is the system of _rays_\r\nwhich seem to radiate like spokes from some of the larger craters,\r\nextending over hill and valley sometimes for hundreds of miles. A\r\nsuggestion of these rays may be seen in Fig. 55, extending from the\r\ngreat crater Copernicus a little southwest of the end of the Apennines,\r\nbut their most perfect development is to be seen at the time of full\r\nmoon around the crater Tycho, which lies near the south pole of the\r\nmoon. Look for them with an opera glass.\r\n\r\nAnother and even less conspicuous feature is furnished by the rills,\r\nwhich, under favorable conditions of illumination, appear like long\r\ncracks on the moon's surface, perhaps analogous to the cañons of our\r\nWestern country.\r\n\r\n101. THE MAP OF THE MOON.--Fig. 55 furnishes a fairly good map of a\r\nlimited portion of the moon near the terminator, but at the edges little\r\nor no detail can be seen. This is always true; the whole of the moon can\r\nnot be seen to advantage at any one time, and to remedy this we need to\r\nconstruct from many photographs or drawings a map which shall represent\r\nthe several parts of the moon as they appear at their best. Fig. 56\r\nshows such a map photographed from a relief model of the moon, and\r\nrepresenting the principal features of the lunar surface in a way they\r\ncan never be seen simultaneously. Perhaps its most striking feature is\r\nthe shape of the craters, which are shown round in the central parts of\r\nthe map and oval at the edges, with their long diameters parallel to the\r\nmoon's edge. This is, of course, an effect of the curvature of the\r\nmoon's surface, for we look very obliquely at the edge portions, and\r\nthus see their formations much foreshortened in the direction of the\r\nmoon's radius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Relief map of the moon's surface.--After\r\nNASMYTH and CARPENTER.]\r\n\r\nThe north and south poles of the moon are at the top and bottom of the\r\nmap respectively, and a mere inspection of the regions around them will\r\nshow how much more rugged is the southern hemisphere of the moon than\r\nthe northern. It furnishes, too, some indication of how numerous are the\r\nlunar craters, and how in crowded regions they overlap one another.\r\n\r\nThe student should pick out upon the map those features which he has\r\nlearned to know in the photograph (Fig. 55)--the Apennines, Copernicus,\r\nand the continuation of the Apennines, extending into the dark part of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Mare Imbrium. Photographed by G. W. RITCHEY.]\r\n\r\n102. SIZE OF THE LUNAR FEATURES.--We may measure distances here in the\r\nsame way as upon a terrestrial map, remembering that near the edges the\r\nscale of the map is very much distorted parallel to the moon's diameter,\r\nand measurements must not be taken in this direction, but may be taken\r\nparallel to the edge. Measuring with a millimeter scale, we find on the\r\nmap for the diameter of the crater Copernicus, 2.1 millimeters. To turn\r\nthis into the diameter of the real Copernicus in miles, we measure upon\r\nthe same map the diameter of the moon, 79.7 millimeters, and then have\r\nthe proportion--\r\n\r\n    Diameter of Copernicus in miles : 2,163 :: 2.1 : 79.7,\r\n\r\nwhich when solved gives 57 miles. The real diameter of Copernicus is a\r\ntrifle over 56 miles. At the eastern edge of the moon, opposite the\r\nApennines, is a large oval spot called the Mare Crisium (Latin, _ma-re_\r\n= sea). Measure its length. The large crater to the northwest of the\r\nApennines is called Archimedes. Measure its diameter both in the map and\r\nin the photograph (Fig. 55), and see how the two results agree. The true\r\ndiameter of this crater, east and west, is very approximately 50 miles.\r\nThe great smooth surface to the west of Archimedes is the Mare Imbrium.\r\nIs it larger or smaller than Lake Superior? Fig. 57 is from a photograph\r\nof the Mare Imbrium, and the amount of detail here shown at the bottom\r\nof the sea is a sufficient indication that, in this case at least, the\r\nwater has been drawn off, if indeed any was ever present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Mare Crisium. Lick Observatory photographs.]\r\n\r\nFig. 58 is a representation of the Mare Crisium at a time when night was\r\nbeginning to encroach upon its eastern border, and it serves well to\r\nshow the rugged character of the ring-shaped wall which incloses this\r\narea.\r\n\r\nWith these pictures of the smoother parts of the moon's surface we may\r\ncompare Fig. 59, which shows a region near the north pole of the moon,\r\nand Fig. 60, giving an early morning view of Archimedes and the\r\nApennines. Note how long and sharp are the shadows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Illustrating the rugged character of the moon's\r\nsurface.--NASMYTH and CARPENTER.]\r\n\r\n103. THE MOON'S ATMOSPHERE.--Upon the earth the sun casts no shadows so\r\nsharp and black as those of Fig. 60, because his rays are here scattered\r\nand reflected in all directions by the dust and vapors of the\r\natmosphere (§ 51), so that the place from which direct sunlight is cut\r\noff is at least partially illumined by this reflected light. The shadows\r\nof Fig. 60 show that upon the moon it must be otherwise, and suggest\r\nthat if the moon has any atmosphere whatever, its density must be\r\nutterly insignificant in comparison with that of the earth. In its\r\nmotion around the earth the moon frequently eclipses stars (_occults_ is\r\nthe technical word), and if the moon had an atmosphere such as is shown\r\nin Fig. 61, the light from the star _A_ must shine through this\r\natmosphere just before the moon's advancing body cuts it off, and it\r\nmust be refracted by the atmosphere so that the star would appear in a\r\nslightly different direction (nearer to _B_) than before. The earth's\r\natmosphere refracts the starlight under such circumstances by more than\r\na degree, but no one has been able to find in the case of the moon any\r\neffect of this kind amounting to even a fraction of a second of arc.\r\nWhile this hardly justifies the statement sometimes made that the moon\r\nhas no atmosphere, we shall be entirely safe in saying that if it has\r\none at all its density is less than a thousandth part of that of the\r\nearth's atmosphere. Quite in keeping with this absence of an atmosphere\r\nis the fact that clouds never float over the surface of the moon. Its\r\nfeatures always stand out hard and clear, without any of that haze and\r\nsoftness of outline which our atmosphere introduces into all terrestrial\r\nlandscapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Archimedes and Apennines. NASMYTH and\r\nCARPENTER.]\r\n\r\n104. HEIGHT OF THE LUNAR MOUNTAINS.--Attention has already been called\r\nto the detached mountain peaks, which in Fig. 55 prolong the range of\r\nApennines into the lunar night. These are the beginnings of the Caucasus\r\nmountains, and from the photograph we may measure as follows the height\r\nto which they rise above the surrounding level of the moon: Fig. 62\r\nrepresents a part of the lunar surface along the boundary line between\r\nnight and day, the horizontal line at the top of the figure representing\r\na level ray of sunlight which just touches the moon at _T_ and barely\r\nilluminates the top of the mountain, _M_, whose height, _h_, is to be\r\ndetermined. If we let _R_ stand for the radius of the moon and _s_ for\r\nthe distance, _T M_, we shall have in the right-angled triangle _M T C_,\r\n\r\n    R^{2} + s^{2} = (R + h)^{2},\r\n\r\nand we need only to measure _s_--that is, the distance from the\r\nterminator to the detached mountain peak--to make this equation\r\ndetermine _h_, since _R_ is already known, being half the diameter of\r\nthe moon--1,081 miles. Practically it is more convenient to use instead\r\nof this equation another form, which the student who is expert in\r\nalgebra may show to be very nearly equivalent to it:\r\n\r\n        _h_ (miles) = s^{2} / 2163,\r\n    or  _h_ (feet) = 2.44 s^{2}.\r\n\r\nThe distance _s_ must be expressed in miles in all of these equations.\r\nIn Fig. 55 the distance from the terminator to the first detached peak\r\nof the Caucasus mountains is 1.7 millimeters = 52 miles, from which we\r\nfind the height of the mountain to be 1.25 miles, or 6,600 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Occultations and the moon's atmosphere.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Determining the height of a lunar mountain.]\r\n\r\nTwo things, however, need to be borne in mind in this connection. On the\r\nearth we measure the heights of mountains _above sea level_, while on\r\nthe moon there is no sea, and our 6,600 feet is simply the height of the\r\nmountain top above the level of that particular point in the terminator,\r\nfrom which we measure its distance. So too it is evident from the\r\nappearance of things, that the sunlight, instead of just touching the\r\ntop of the particular mountain whose height we have measured, really\r\nextends some little distance down from its summit, and the 6,600 feet is\r\ntherefore the elevation of the lowest point on the mountains to which\r\nthe sunlight reaches. The peak itself may be several hundred feet\r\nhigher, and our photograph must be taken at the exact moment when this\r\npeak appears in the lunar morning or disappears in the evening if we are\r\nto measure the altitude of the mountain's summit. Measure the height of\r\nthe most northern visible mountain of the Caucasus range. This is one of\r\nthe outlying spurs of the great mountain Calippus, whose principal peak,\r\n19,000 feet high, is shown in Fig. 55 as the brightest part of the\r\nCaucasus range.\r\n\r\nThe highest peak of the lunar Apennines, Huyghens, has an altitude of\r\n18,000 feet, and the Leibnitz and Doerfel Mountains, near the south pole\r\nof the moon, reach an altitude 50 per cent greater than this, and are\r\nprobably the highest peaks on the moon. This falls very little short of\r\nthe highest mountain on the earth, although the moon is much smaller\r\nthan the earth, and these mountains are considerably higher than\r\nanything on the western continent of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe vagueness of outline of the terminator makes it difficult to measure\r\nfrom it with precision, and somewhat more accurate determinations of the\r\nheights of lunar mountains can be obtained by measuring the length of\r\nthe shadows which they cast, and the depths of craters may also be\r\nmeasured by means of the shadows which fall into them.\r\n\r\n105. CRATERS.--Fig. 63 shows a typical lunar crater, and conveys a good\r\nidea of the ruggedness of the lunar landscape. Compare the appearance of\r\nthis crater with the following generalizations, which are based upon the\r\naccurate measurement of many such:\r\n\r\nA. A crater is a real depression in the surface of the moon, surrounded\r\nusually by an elevated ring which rises above the general level of the\r\nregion outside, while the bottom of the crater is about an equal\r\ndistance below that level.\r\n\r\nB. Craters are shallow, their diameters ranging from five times to more\r\nthan fifty times their depth. Archimedes, whose diameter we found to be\r\n50 miles, has an average depth of about 4,000 feet below the crest of\r\nits surrounding wall, and is relatively a shallow crater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--A typical lunar crater.--NASMYTH and\r\nCARPENTER.]\r\n\r\nC. Craters frequently have one or more hills rising within them which,\r\nhowever, rarely, if ever, reach up to the level of the surrounding wall.\r\n\r\nD. Whatever may have been the mode of their formation, the craters can\r\nnot have been produced by scooping out material from the center and\r\npiling it up to make the wall, for in three cases out of four the volume\r\nof the excavation is greater than the volume of material contained in\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n106. MOON AND EARTH.--We have gone far enough now to appreciate both the\r\nlikeness and the unlikeness of the moon and earth. They may fairly\r\nenough be likened to offspring of the same parent who have followed very\r\ndifferent careers, and in the fullness of time find themselves in very\r\ndifferent circumstances. The most serious point of difference in these\r\ncircumstances is the atmosphere, which gives to the earth a wealth of\r\nphenomena altogether lacking in the moon. Clouds, wind, rain, snow,\r\ndew, frost, and hail are all dependent upon the atmosphere and can not\r\nbe found where it is not. There can be nothing upon the moon at all like\r\nthat great group of changes which we call weather, and the unruffled\r\naspect of the moon's face contrasts sharply with the succession of cloud\r\nand sunshine which the earth would present if seen from the moon.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is the chief agent in the propagation of sound, and\r\nwithout it the moon must be wrapped in silence more absolute than can be\r\nfound upon the surface of the earth. So, too, the absence of an\r\natmosphere shows that there can be no water or other liquid upon the\r\nmoon, for if so it would immediately evaporate and produce a gaseous\r\nenvelope which we have seen does not exist. With air and water absent\r\nthere can be of course no vegetation or life of any kind upon the moon,\r\nand we are compelled to regard it as an arid desert, utterly waste.\r\n\r\n107. TEMPERATURE OF THE MOON.--A characteristic feature of terrestrial\r\ndeserts, which is possessed in exaggerated degree by the moon, is the\r\ngreat extremes of temperature to which they and it are subject. Owing to\r\nits slow rotation about its axis, a point on the moon receives the solar\r\nradiation uninterruptedly for more than a fortnight, and that too\r\nunmitigated by any cloud or vaporous covering. Then for a like period it\r\nis turned away from the sun and allowed to cool off, radiating into\r\ninterplanetary space without hindrance its accumulated store of heat. It\r\nis easy to see that the range of temperature between day and night must\r\nbe much greater under these circumstances than it is with us where\r\nshorter days and clouded skies render day and night more nearly alike,\r\nto say nothing of the ocean whose waters serve as a great balance wheel\r\nfor equalizing temperatures. Just how hot or how cold the moon becomes\r\nis hard to determine, and very different estimates are to be found in\r\nthe books. Perhaps the most reliable of these are furnished by the\r\nrecent researches of Professor Very, whose experiments lead him to\r\nconclude that \"its rocky surface at midday, in latitudes where the sun\r\nis high, is probably hotter than boiling water and only the most\r\nterrible of earth's deserts, where the burning sands blister the skin,\r\nand men, beasts, and birds drop dead, can approach a noontide on the\r\ncloudless surface of our satellite. Only the extreme polar latitudes of\r\nthe moon can have an endurable temperature by day, to say nothing of the\r\nnight, when we should have to become troglodytes to preserve ourselves\r\nfrom such intense cold.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the night temperature of the moon, even very soon after sunset,\r\nsinks to something like 200° below zero on the centigrade scale, or 320°\r\nbelow zero on the Fahrenheit scale, the lowest known temperature upon\r\nthe earth, according to General Greely, is 90° Fahr. below zero,\r\nrecorded in Siberia in January, 1885.\r\n\r\nWinter and summer are not markedly different upon the moon, since its\r\nrotation axis is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the earth's orbit\r\nabout the sun, and the sun never goes far north or south of the moon's\r\nequator. The month is the one cycle within which all seasonal changes in\r\nits physical condition appear to run their complete course.\r\n\r\n108. CHANGES IN THE MOON.--It is evidently idle to look for any such\r\nchanges in the condition of the moon's surface as with us mark the\r\nprogress of the seasons or the spread of civilization over the\r\nwilderness. But minor changes there may be, and it would seem that the\r\nviolent oscillations of temperature from day to night ought to have some\r\neffect in breaking down and crumbling the sharp peaks and crags which\r\nare there so common and so pronounced. For a century past astronomers\r\nhave searched carefully for changes of this kind--the filling up of some\r\ncrater or the fall of a mountain peak; but while some things of this\r\nkind have been reported from time to time, the evidence in their behalf\r\nhas not been altogether conclusive. At the present time it is an open\r\nquestion whether changes of this sort large enough to be seen from the\r\nearth are in progress. A crater much less than a mile wide can be seen\r\nin the telescope, but it is not easy to tell whether so minute an object\r\nhas changed in size or shape during a year or a decade, and even if\r\nchanges are seen they may be apparent rather than real. Fig. 64 contains\r\ntwo views of the crater Archimedes, taken under a morning and an\r\nafternoon sun respectively, and shows a very pronounced difference\r\nbetween the two which proceeds solely from a difference of illumination.\r\nIn the presence of such large fictitious changes astronomers are slow to\r\naccept smaller ones as real.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Archimedes in the lunar morning and\r\nafternoon.--WEINEK.]\r\n\r\nIt is this absence of change that is responsible for the rugged and\r\nsharp-cut features of the moon which continue substantially as they were\r\nmade, while upon the earth rain and frost are continually wearing down\r\nthe mountains and spreading their substance upon the lowland in an\r\nunending process of smoothing off the roughnesses of its surface. Upon\r\nthe moon this process is almost if not wholly wanting, and the moon\r\nabides to-day much more like its primitive condition than is the earth.\r\n\r\n109. THE MOON'S INFLUENCE UPON THE EARTH.--There is a widespread popular\r\nbelief that in many ways the moon exercises a considerable influence\r\nupon terrestrial affairs: that it affects the weather for good or ill,\r\nthat crops must be planted and harvested, pigs must be killed, and\r\ntimber cut at the right time of the moon, etc. Our common word lunatic\r\nmeans moonstruck--i. e., one upon whom the moon has shone while\r\nsleeping. There is not the slightest scientific basis for any of these\r\nbeliefs, and astronomers everywhere class them with tales of witchcraft,\r\nmagic, and popular delusion. For the most part the moon's influence upon\r\nthe earth is limited to the light which it sends and the effect of its\r\ngravitation, chiefly exhibited in the ocean tides. We receive from the\r\nmoon a very small amount of second-hand solar heat and there is also a\r\ntrifling magnetic influence, but neither of these last effects comes\r\nwithin the range of ordinary observation, and we shall not go far wrong\r\nin saying that, save the moonlight and the tides, every supposed lunar\r\ninfluence upon the earth is either fictitious or too small to be readily\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\n110. DEPENDENCE OF THE EARTH UPON THE SUN.--There is no better\r\nintroduction to the study of the sun than Byron's Ode to Darkness,\r\nbeginning with the lines--\r\n\r\n    \"I dreamed a dream\r\n    That was not all a dream.\r\n    The bright sun was extinguished,\"\r\n\r\nand proceeding to depict in vivid words the consequences of this\r\nextinction. The most matter-of-fact language of science agrees with the\r\nwords of the poet in declaring the earth's dependence upon the sun for\r\nall those varied forms of energy which make it a fit abode for living\r\nbeings. The winds blow and the rivers run; the crops grow, are gathered\r\nand consumed, by virtue of the solar energy. Factory, locomotive, beast,\r\nbird, and the human body furnish types of machines run by energy derived\r\nfrom the sun; and the student will find it an instructive exercise to\r\nsearch for kinds of terrestrial energy which are not derived either\r\ndirectly or indirectly from the sun. There are a few such, but they are\r\nneither numerous nor important.\r\n\r\n111. THE SUN'S DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH.--To the astronomer the sun\r\npresents problems of the highest consequence and apparently of very\r\ndiverse character, but all tending toward the same goal: the framing of\r\na mechanical explanation of the sun considered as a machine; what it is,\r\nand how it does its work. In the forefront of these problems stand those\r\nnumerical determinations of distance, size, mass, density, etc., which\r\nwe have already encountered in connection with the moon, but which must\r\nhere be dealt with in a different manner, because the immensely greater\r\ndistance of the sun makes impossible the resort to any such simple\r\nmethod as the triangle used for determining the moon's distance. It\r\nwould be like determining the distance of a steeple a mile away by\r\nobserving its direction first from one eye, then from the other; too\r\nshort a base for the triangle. In one respect, however, we stand upon a\r\nbetter footing than in the case of the moon, for the mass of the earth\r\nhas already been found (Chapter IV) as a fractional part of the sun's\r\nmass, and we have only to invert the fraction in order to find that the\r\nsun's mass is 329,000 times that of the earth and moon combined, or\r\n333,000 times that of the earth alone.\r\n\r\nIf we could rely implicitly upon this number we might make it determine\r\nfor us the distance of the sun through the law of gravitation as\r\nfollows: It was suggested in § 38 that Newton proved Kepler's three laws\r\nto be imperfect corollaries from the law of gravitation, requiring a\r\nlittle amendment to make them strictly correct, and below we give in the\r\nform of an equation Kepler's statement of the Third Law together with\r\nNewton's amendment of it. In these equations--\r\n\r\n_T_ = Periodic time of any planet;\r\n\r\n_a_ = One half the major axis of its orbit;\r\n\r\n_m_ = Its mass;\r\n\r\n_M_ = The mass of the sun;\r\n\r\n_k_ = The gravitation constant corresponding to the particular set of\r\nunits in which _T_, _a_, _m_, and _M_ are expressed.\r\n\r\n  (Kepler) a^{3}/T^{2} = h;\r\n  (Newton) a^{3}/T^{2} = k (M + m).\r\n\r\nKepler's idea was: For every planet which moves around the sun, _a^{3}_\r\ndivided by _T^{2}_ always gives the same quotient, _h_; and he did not\r\nconcern himself with the significance of this quotient further than to\r\nnote that if the particular _a_ and _T_ which belong to any\r\nplanet--e. g., the earth--be taken as the units of length and time, then\r\nthe quotient will be 1. Newton, on the other hand, attached a meaning to\r\nthe quotient, and showed that it is equal to the product obtained by\r\nmultiplying the sum of the two masses, planet and sun, by a number which\r\nis always the same when we are dealing with the action of gravitation,\r\nwhether it be between the sun and planet, or between moon and earth, or\r\nbetween the earth and a roast of beef in the butcher's scales, provided\r\nonly that we use always the same units with which to measure times,\r\ndistances, and masses.\r\n\r\nNumerically, Newton's correction to Kepler's Third Law does not amount\r\nto much in the motion of the planets. Jupiter, which shows the greatest\r\neffect, makes the circuit of his orbit in 4,333 days instead of 4,335,\r\nwhich it would require if Kepler's law were strictly true. But in\r\nanother respect the change is of the utmost importance, since it enables\r\nus to extend Kepler's law, which relates solely to the sun and its\r\nplanets, to other attracting bodies, such as the earth, moon, and stars.\r\nThus for the moon's motion around the earth we write--\r\n\r\n    (240,000^{3})/(27.32^{2}) = k (1 + 1/81),\r\n\r\nfrom which we may find that, with the units here employed, the earth's\r\nmass as the unit of mass, the mean solar day as the unit of time, and\r\nthe mile as the unit of distance--\r\n\r\n    k = 1830 × 10^{10}.\r\n\r\nIf we introduce this value of _k_ into the corresponding equation, which\r\nrepresents the motion of the earth around the sun, we shall have--\r\n\r\n    a^{3}/(365.25)^{2} = 1830 × 10^{10} (333,000 + 1),\r\n\r\nwhere the large number in the parenthesis represents the number of times\r\nthe mass of the sun is greater than the mass of the earth. We shall find\r\nby solving this equation that _a_, the mean distance of the sun from the\r\nearth, is very approximately 93,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\n113. ANOTHER METHOD OF DETERMINING THE SUN'S DISTANCE.--This will be\r\nbest appreciated by a reference to Fig. 17. It appears here that the\r\nearth makes its nearest approach to the orbit of Mars in the month of\r\nAugust, and if in any August Mars happens to be in opposition, its\r\ndistance from the earth will be very much less than the distance of the\r\nsun from the earth, and may be measured by methods not unlike those\r\nwhich served for the moon. If now the orbits of Mars and the earth were\r\ncircles having their centers at the sun this distance between them,\r\nwhich we may represent by _D_, would be the difference of the radii of\r\nthese orbits--\r\n\r\n    D = a´´ - a´,\r\n\r\nwhere the accents ´´, ´ represent Mars and the earth respectively.\r\nKepler's Third Law furnishes the relation--\r\n\r\n    (a´´)^{3}/(T´´)^{2} = (a´)^{3}/(T´)^{2};\r\n\r\nand since the periodic times of the earth and Mars, _T´_, _T´´_, are\r\nknown to a high degree of accuracy, these two equations are sufficient\r\nto determine the two unknown quantities, _a´_, _a´´_--i. e., the\r\ndistance of the sun from Mars as well as from the earth. The first of\r\nthese equations is, of course, not strictly true, on account of the\r\nelliptical shape of the orbits, but this can be allowed for easily\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nIn practice it is found better to apply this method of determining the\r\nsun's distance through observations of an asteroid rather than\r\nobservations of Mars, and great interest has been aroused among\r\nastronomers by the discovery, in 1898, of an asteroid, or planet, Eros,\r\nwhich at times comes much closer to the earth than does Mars or any\r\nother heavenly body except the moon, and which will at future\r\noppositions furnish a more accurate determination of the sun's distance\r\nthan any hitherto available. Observations for this purpose are being\r\nmade at the present time (October, 1900).\r\n\r\nMany other methods of measuring the sun's distance have been devised by\r\nastronomers, some of them extremely ingenious and interesting, but every\r\none of them has its weak point--e. g., the determination of the mass of\r\nthe earth in the first method given above and the measurement of _D_ in\r\nthe second method, so that even the best results at present are\r\nuncertain to the extent of 200,000 miles or more, and astronomers,\r\ninstead of relying upon any one method, must use all of them, and take\r\nan average of their results. According to Professor Harkness, this\r\naverage value is 92,796,950 miles, and it seems certain that a line of\r\nthis length drawn from the earth toward the sun would end somewhere\r\nwithin the body of the sun, but whether on the nearer or the farther\r\nside of the center, or exactly at it, no man knows.\r\n\r\n114. PARALLAX AND DISTANCE.--It is quite customary among astronomers to\r\nspeak of the sun's parallax, instead of its distance from the earth,\r\nmeaning by parallax its difference of direction as seen from the center\r\nand surface of the earth--i. e., the angle subtended at the sun by a\r\nradius of the earth placed at right angles to the line of sight. The\r\ngreater the sun's distance the smaller will this angle be, and it\r\ntherefore makes a substitute for the distance which has the advantage of\r\nbeing represented by a small number, 8\".8, instead of a large one.\r\n\r\nThe books abound with illustrations intended to help the reader\r\ncomprehend how great is a distance of 93,000,000 miles, but a single one\r\nof these must suffice here. To ride 100 miles a day 365 days in the year\r\nwould be counted a good bicycling record, but the rider who started at\r\nthe beginning of the Christian era and rode at that rate toward the sun\r\nfrom the year 1 A. D. down to the present moment would not yet have\r\nreached his destination, although his journey would be about three\r\nquarters done. He would have crossed the orbit of Venus about the time\r\nof Charlemagne, and that of Mercury soon after the discovery of America.\r\n\r\n115. SIZE AND DENSITY OF THE SUN.--Knowing the distance of the sun, it\r\nis easy to find from the angle subtended by its diameter (32 minutes of\r\narc) that the length of that diameter is 865,000 miles. We recall in\r\nthis connection that the diameter of the moon's _orbit_ is only 480,000\r\nmiles, but little more than half the diameter of the sun, thus affording\r\nabundant room inside the sun, and to spare, for the moon to perform the\r\nmonthly revolution about its orbit, as shown in Fig. 65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--The sun's size.--YOUNG.]\r\n\r\nIn the same manner in which the density of the moon was found from its\r\nmass and diameter, the student may find from the mass and diameter of\r\nthe sun given above that its mean density is 1.4 times that of water.\r\nThis is about the same as the density of gravel or soft coal, and is\r\njust about one quarter of the average density of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe recall that the small density of the moon was accounted for by the\r\ndiminished weight of objects upon it, but this explanation can not hold\r\nin the case of the sun, for not only is the density less but the force\r\nof gravity (weight) is there 28 times as great as upon the earth. The\r\nathlete who here weighs 175 pounds, if transported to the surface of the\r\nsun would weigh more than an elephant does here, and would find his\r\nbones break under his own weight if his muscles were strong enough to\r\nhold him upright. The tremendous pressure exerted by gravity at the\r\nsurface of the sun must be surpassed below the surface, and as it does\r\nnot pack the material together and make it dense, we are driven to one\r\nof two conclusions: Either the stuff of which the sun is made is\r\naltogether unlike that of the earth, not so readily compressed by\r\npressure, or there is some opposing influence at work which more than\r\nbalances the effect of gravity and makes the solar stuff much lighter\r\nthan the terrestrial.\r\n\r\n116. MATERIAL OF WHICH THE SUN IS MADE.--As to the first of these\r\nalternatives, the spectroscope comes to our aid and shows in the sun's\r\nspectrum (Fig. 50) the characteristic line marked _D_, which we know\r\nalways indicates the presence of sodium and identifies at least one\r\nterrestrial substance as present in the sun in considerable quantity.\r\nThe lines marked _C_ and _F_ are produced by hydrogen, which is one of\r\nthe constituents of water, _E_ shows calcium to be present in the sun,\r\n_b_ magnesium, etc. In this way it has been shown that about one half of\r\nour terrestrial elements, mainly the metallic ones, are present as gases\r\non or near the sun's surface, but it must not be inferred that elements\r\nnot found in this way are absent from the sun. They may be there,\r\nprobably are there, but the spectroscopic proof of their presence is\r\nmore difficult to obtain. Professor Rowland, who has been prominent in\r\nthe study of the solar spectrum, says: \"Were the whole earth heated to\r\nthe temperature of the sun, its spectrum would probably resemble that of\r\nthe sun very closely.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the common terrestrial elements found in the sun are:\r\n\r\n      Aluminium.\r\n      Calcium.\r\n      Carbon.\r\n      Copper.\r\n      Hydrogen.\r\n      Iron.\r\n      Lead.\r\n      Nickel.\r\n      Potassium.\r\n      Silicon.\r\n      Silver.\r\n      Sodium.\r\n      Tin.\r\n      Zinc.\r\n      Oxygen (?)\r\n\r\nWhatever differences of chemical structure may exist between the sun and\r\nthe earth, it seems that we must regard these bodies as more like than\r\nunlike to each other in substance, and we are brought back to the second\r\nof our alternatives: there must be some influence opposing the force of\r\ngravity and making the substance of the sun light instead of heavy, and\r\nwe need not seek far to find it in--\r\n\r\n117. THE HEAT OF THE SUN.--That the sun is hot is too evident to require\r\nproof, and it is a familiar fact that heat expands most substances and\r\nmakes them less dense. The sun's heat falling upon the earth expands it\r\nand diminishes its density in some small degree, and we have only to\r\nimagine this process of expansion continued until the earth's diameter\r\nbecomes 58 per cent larger than it now is, to find the earth's density\r\nreduced to a level with that of the sun. Just how much the temperature\r\nof the earth must be raised to produce this amount of expansion we do\r\nnot know, neither do we know accurately the temperature of the sun, but\r\nthere can be no doubt that heat is the cause of the sun's low density\r\nand that the corresponding temperature is very high.\r\n\r\nBefore we inquire more closely into the sun's temperature, it will be\r\nwell to draw a sharp distinction between the two terms heat and\r\ntemperature, which are often used as if they meant the same thing. Heat\r\nis a form of energy which may be found in varying degree in every\r\nsubstance, whether warm or cold--a block of ice contains a considerable\r\namount of heat--while temperature corresponds to our sensations of warm\r\nand cold, and measures the extent to which heat is concentrated in the\r\nbody. It is the amount of heat per molecule of the body. A barrel of\r\nwarm water contains more heat than the flame of a match, but its\r\ntemperature is not so high. Bearing in mind this distinction, we seek to\r\ndetermine not the amount of heat contained in the sun but the sun's\r\ntemperature, and this involves the same difficulty as does the question,\r\nWhat is the temperature of a locomotive? It is one thing in the fire box\r\nand another thing in the driving wheels, and still another at the\r\nheadlight; and so with the sun, its temperature is certainly different\r\nin different parts--one thing at the center and another at the surface.\r\nEven those parts which we see are covered by a veil of gases which\r\nproduce by absorption the dark lines of the solar spectrum, and\r\nseriously interfere both with the emission of energy from the sun and\r\nwith our attempts at measuring the temperature of those parts of the\r\nsurface from which that energy streams.\r\n\r\nIn view of these and other difficulties we need not be surprised that\r\nthe wildest discordance has been found in estimates of the solar\r\ntemperature made by different investigators, who have assigned to it\r\nvalues ranging from 1,400° C. to more than 5,000,000° C. Quite recently,\r\nhowever, improved methods and a better understanding of the problem have\r\nbrought about a better agreement of results, and it now seems probable\r\nthat the temperature of the visible surface of the sun lies somewhere\r\nbetween 5,000° and 10,000° C., say 15,000° of the Fahrenheit scale.\r\n\r\n118. DETERMINING THE SUN'S TEMPERATURE.--One ingenious method which has\r\nbeen used for determining this temperature is based upon the principle\r\nstated above, that every object, whether warm or cold, contains heat and\r\ngives it off in the form of radiant energy. The radiation from a body\r\nwhose temperature is lower than 500° C. is made up exclusively of energy\r\nwhose wave length is greater than 7,600 tenth meters, and is therefore\r\ninvisible to the eye, although a thermometer or even the human hand can\r\noften detect it as radiant heat. A brick wall in the summer sunshine\r\ngives off energy which can be felt as heat but can not be seen. When\r\nsuch a body is further heated it continues to send off the same kinds\r\n(wave lengths) of energy as before, but new and shorter waves are added\r\nto its radiation, and when it begins to emit energy of wave length 7,500\r\nor 7,600 tenth meters, it also begins to shine with a dull-red light,\r\nwhich presently becomes brighter and less ruddy and changes to white as\r\nthe temperature rises, and waves of still shorter length are thereby\r\nadded to the radiation. We say, in common speech, the body becomes first\r\nred hot and then white hot, and we thus recognize in a general way that\r\nthe kind or color of the radiation which a body gives off is an index to\r\nits temperature. The greater the proportion of energy of short wave\r\nlengths the higher is the temperature of the radiating body. In sunlight\r\nthe maximum of brilliancy to the eye lies at or near the wave length,\r\n5,600 tenth meters, but the greatest intensity of radiation of all kinds\r\n(light included) is estimated to fall somewhere between green and blue\r\nin the spectrum at or near the wave length 5,000 tenth meters, and if we\r\ncan apply to this wave length Paschen's law--temperature reckoned in\r\ndegrees centigrade from the absolute zero is always equal to the\r\nquotient obtained by dividing the number 27,000,000 by the wave length\r\ncorresponding to maximum radiation--we shall find at once for the\r\nabsolute temperature of the sun's surface 5,400° C.\r\n\r\nPaschen's law has been shown to hold true, at least approximately, for\r\nlower temperatures and longer wave lengths than are here involved, but\r\nas it is not yet certain that it is strictly true and holds for all\r\ntemperatures, too great reliance must not be attached to the numerical\r\nresult furnished by it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--The sun, August 11, 1894. Photographed at the\r\nGoodsell Observatory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--The sun, August 14, 1894. Photographed at the\r\nGoodsell Observatory.]\r\n\r\n119. THE SUN'S SURFACE.--A marked contrast exists between the faces of\r\nsun and moon in respect of the amount of detail to be seen upon them,\r\nthe sun showing nothing whatever to correspond with the mountains,\r\ncraters, and seas of the moon. The unaided eye in general finds in the\r\nsun only a blank bright circle as smooth and unmarked as the surface of\r\nstill water, and even the telescope at first sight seems to show but\r\nlittle more. There may usually be found upon the sun's face a certain\r\nnumber of black patches called _sun spots_, such as are shown in Figs.\r\n66 to 69, and occasionally these are large enough to be seen through a\r\nsmoked glass without the aid of a telescope. When seen near the edge of\r\nthe sun they are quite frequently accompanied, as in Fig. 69, by vague\r\npatches called _faculæ_ (Latin, _facula_ = a little torch), which look a\r\nlittle brighter than the surrounding parts of the sun. So, too, a good\r\nphotograph of the sun usually shows that the central parts of the disk\r\nare rather brighter than the edge, as indeed we should expect them to\r\nbe, since the absorption lines in the sun's spectrum have already taught\r\nus that the visible surface of the sun is enveloped by invisible vapors\r\nwhich in some measure absorb the emitted light and render it feebler at\r\nthe edge where it passes through a greater thickness of this envelope\r\nthan at the center. See Fig. 70, where it is shown that the energy\r\ncoming from the edge of the sun to the earth has to traverse a much\r\nlonger path inside the vapors than does that coming from the center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--The sun, August 18, 1894. Photographed at the\r\nGoodsell Observatory.]\r\n\r\nExamine the sun spots in the four photographs, Figs. 66 to 69, and note\r\nthat the two spots which appear at the extreme left of the first\r\nphotograph, very much distorted and foreshortened by the curvature of\r\nthe sun's surface, are seen in a different part of the second picture,\r\nand are not only more conspicuous but show better their true shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II. THE EQUATORIAL CONSTELLATIONS]\r\n\r\n120. THE SUN'S ROTATION.--The changed position of these spots shows that\r\nthe sun rotates about an axis at right angles to the direction of the\r\nspot's motion, and the position of this axis is shown in the figure by a\r\nfaint line ruled obliquely across the face of the sun nearly north and\r\nsouth in each of the four photographs. This rotation in the space of\r\nthree days has carried the spots from the edge halfway to the center of\r\nthe disk, and the student should note the progress of the spots in the\r\ntwo later photographs, that of August 21st showing them just ready to\r\ndisappear around the farther edge of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--The sun, August 21, 1894. Photographed at the\r\nGoodsell Observatory.]\r\n\r\nPlot accurately in one of these figures the positions of the spots as\r\nshown in the other three, and observe whether the path of the spots\r\nacross the sun's face is a straight line. Is there any reason why it\r\nshould not be straight?\r\n\r\nThese four pictures may be made to illustrate many things about the sun.\r\nThus the sun's axis is not parallel to that of the earth, for the\r\nletters _N S_ mark the direction of a north and south line across the\r\nface of the sun, and this line, of course, is parallel to the earth's\r\naxis, while it is evidently not parallel to the sun's axis. The group of\r\nspots took more than ten days to move across the sun's face, and as at\r\nleast an equal time must be required to move around the opposite side of\r\nthe sun, it is evident that the period of the sun's rotation is\r\nsomething more than 20 days. It is, in fact, rather more than 25 days,\r\nfor this same group of spots reappeared again on the left-hand edge of\r\nthe sun on September 5th.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Absorption at the sun's edge.]\r\n\r\n121. SUN SPOTS.--Another significant fact comes out plainly from the\r\nphotographs. The spots are not permanent features of the sun's face,\r\nsince they changed their size and shape very appreciably in the few days\r\ncovered by the pictures. Compare particularly the photographs of August\r\n14th and August 18th, where the spots are least distorted by the\r\ncurvature of the sun's surface. By September 16th this group of spots\r\nhad disappeared absolutely from the sun's face, although when at its\r\nlargest the group extended more than 80,000 miles in length, and several\r\nof the individual spots were large enough to contain the earth if it had\r\nbeen dropped upon them. From Fig. 67 determine in miles the length of\r\nthe group on August 14th. Fig. 71 shows an enlarged view of these spots\r\nas they appeared on August 17th, and in this we find some details not so\r\nwell shown in the preceding pictures. The larger spots consist of a\r\nblack part called the _nucleus_ or _umbra_ (Latin, shadow), which is\r\nsurrounded by an irregular border called the _penumbra_ (partial\r\nshadow), which is intermediate in brightness between the nucleus and\r\nthe surrounding parts of the sun. It should not be inferred from the\r\npicture that the nucleus is really black or even dark. It shines, in\r\nfact, with a brilliancy greater than that of an electric lamp, but the\r\nbackground furnished by the sun's surface is so much brighter that by\r\ncontrast with it the nucleus and penumbra appear relatively dark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Sun spots, August 17, 1894. Goodsell\r\nObservatory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Sun spot of March 5, 1873.--From LANGLEY, The\r\nNew Astronomy. By permission of the publishers.]\r\n\r\nThe bright shining surface of the sun, the background for the spots, is\r\ncalled the _photosphere_ (Greek, light sphere), and, as Fig. 71 shows,\r\nit assumes under a suitable magnifying power a mottled aspect quite\r\ndifferent from the featureless expanse shown in the earlier pictures.\r\nThe photosphere is, in fact, a layer of little clouds with darker\r\nspaces between them, and the fine detail of these clouds, their\r\ncomplicated structure, and the way in which, when projected against the\r\nbackground of a sun spot, they produce its penumbra, are all brought out\r\nin Fig. 72. Note that the little patch in one corner of this picture\r\nrepresents North and South America drawn to the same scale as the sun\r\nspots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Spectroheliograph, showing distribution of\r\nfaculæ upon the sun.--HALE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Eclipse of July 20, 1878.--TROUVELOT.]\r\n\r\n122. FACULÆ.--We have seen in Fig. 69 a few of the bright spots called\r\nfaculæ. At the telescope or in the ordinary photograph these can be seen\r\nonly at the edge of the sun, because elsewhere the background furnished\r\nby the photosphere is so bright that they are lost in it. It is\r\npossible, however, by an ingenious application of the spectroscope to\r\nbreak up the sunlight into a spectrum in such a way as to diminish the\r\nbrightness of this background, much more than the brightness of the\r\nfaculæ is diminished, and in this way to obtain a photograph of the\r\nsun's surface which shall show them wherever they occur, and such a\r\nphotograph, showing faintly the spectral lines, is reproduced in Fig.\r\n73. The faculæ are the bright patches which stretch inconspicuously\r\nacross the face of the sun, in two rather irregular belts with a\r\ncomparatively empty lane between them. This lane lies along the sun's\r\nequator, and it is upon either side of it between latitudes 5° and 40°\r\nthat faculæ seem to be produced. It is significant of their connection\r\nwith sun spots that the spots occur in these particular zones and are\r\nrarely found outside them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Eclipse of April 16, 1893.--SCHAEBERLE.]\r\n\r\n123. INVISIBLE PARTS OF THE SUN. THE CORONA.--Thus far we have been\r\ndealing with parts of the sun that may be seen and photographed under\r\nall ordinary conditions. But outside of and surrounding these parts is\r\nan envelope, or rather several envelopes, of much greater extent than\r\nthe visible sun. These envelopes are for the most part invisible save at\r\nthose times when the brighter central portions of the sun are hidden in\r\na total eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Eclipse of January 21, 1898.--CAMPBELL.]\r\n\r\nFig. 74 is from a drawing, and Figs. 75 and 76 are from eclipse\r\nphotographs showing this region, in which the most conspicuous object\r\nis the halo of soft light called the _corona_, that completely surrounds\r\nthe sun but is seen to be of differing shapes and differing extent at\r\nthe several eclipses here shown, although a large part of these apparent\r\ndifferences is due to technical difficulties in photographing, and\r\nreproducing an object with outlines so vague as those of the corona. The\r\noutline of the corona is so indefinite and its outer portions so faint\r\nthat it is impossible to assign to it precise dimensions, but at its\r\ngreatest extent it reaches out for several millions of miles and fills a\r\nspace more than twenty times as large as the visible part of the sun.\r\nDespite its huge bulk, it is of most unsubstantial character, an airy\r\nnothing through which comets have been known to force their way around\r\nthe sun from one side to the other, literally for millions of miles,\r\nwithout having their course influenced or their velocity checked to any\r\nappreciable extent. This would hardly be possible if the density even at\r\nthe bottom of the corona were greater than that of the best vacuum which\r\nwe are able to produce in laboratory experiments. It seems odd that a\r\nvacuum should give off so bright a light as the coronal pictures show,\r\nand the exact character of that light and the nature of the corona are\r\nstill subjects of dispute among astronomers, although it is generally\r\nagreed that, in part at least, its light is ordinary sunlight faintly\r\nreflected from the widely scattered molecules composing the substance of\r\nthe corona. It is also probable that in part the light has its origin in\r\nthe corona itself. A curious and at present unconfirmed result announced\r\nby one of the observers of the eclipse of May 28, 1900, is that _the\r\ncorona is not hot_, its effective temperature being lower than that of\r\nthe instrument used for the observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Solar prominence of March 25, 1895.--HALE.]\r\n\r\n124. THE CHROMOSPHERE.--Between the corona and the photosphere there is\r\na thin separating layer called the _chromosphere_ (Greek, color sphere),\r\nbecause when seen at an eclipse it shines with a brilliant red light\r\nquite unlike anything else upon the sun save the _prominences_ which are\r\nthemselves only parts of the chromosphere temporarily thrown above its\r\nsurface, as in a fountain a jet of water is thrown up from the basin and\r\nremains for a few moments suspended in mid-air. Not infrequently in such\r\na fountain foreign matter is swept up by the rush of the water--dirt,\r\ntwigs, small fish, etc.--and in like manner the prominences often carry\r\nalong with them parts of the underlying layers of the sun, photosphere,\r\nfaculæ, etc., which reveal their presence in the prominence by adding\r\ntheir characteristic lines to the spectrum, like that of the\r\nchromosphere, which the prominence presents when they are absent. None\r\nof the eclipse photographs (Figs. 74 to 76) show the chromosphere,\r\nbecause the color effect is lacking in them, but a great curving\r\nprominence may be seen near the bottom of Fig. 75, and smaller ones at\r\nother parts of the sun's edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--A solar prominence.--HALE.]\r\n\r\n125. PROMINENCES.--Fig. 77 shows upon a larger scale one of these\r\nprominences rising to a height of 160,000 miles above the photosphere;\r\nand another photograph, taken 18 minutes later, but not reproduced here,\r\nshowed the same prominence grown in this brief interval to a stature of\r\n280,000 miles. These pictures were not taken during an eclipse, but in\r\nfull sunlight, using the same spectroscopic apparatus which was employed\r\nin connection with the faculæ to diminish the brightness of the\r\nbackground without much enfeebling the brilliancy of the prominence\r\nitself. The dark base from which the prominence seems to spring is not\r\nthe sun's edge, but a part of the apparatus used to cut off the direct\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nFig. 78 contains a series of photographs of another prominence taken\r\nwithin an interval of 1 hour 47 minutes and showing changes in size and\r\nshape which are much more nearly typical of the ordinary prominence than\r\nwas the very unusual change in the case of Fig. 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Contrasted forms of solar\r\nprominences.--ZOELLNER.]\r\n\r\nThe preceding pictures are from photographs, and with them the student\r\nmay compare Fig. 79, which is constructed from drawings made at the\r\nspectroscope by the German astronomer Zoellner. The changes here shown\r\nare most marked in the prominence at the left, which is shaped like a\r\nbroken tree trunk, and which appears to be vibrating from one side to\r\nthe other like a reed shaken in the wind. Such a prominence is\r\nfrequently called an _eruptive_ one, a name suggested by its appearance\r\nof having been blown out from the sun by something like an explosion,\r\nwhile the prominence at the right in this series of drawings, which\r\nappears much less agitated, is called by contrast with the other a\r\n_quiescent_ prominence. These quiescent prominences are, as a rule, much\r\nlonger-lived than the eruptive ones. One more picture of prominences\r\n(Fig. 80) is introduced to show the continuous stretch of chromosphere\r\nout of which they spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Prominences and chromosphere.--HALE.]\r\n\r\nProminences are seen only at the edge of the sun, because it is there\r\nalone that the necessary background can be obtained, but they must occur\r\nat the center of the sun and elsewhere quite as well as at the edge, and\r\nit is probable that quiescent prominences are distributed over all parts\r\nof the sun's surface, but eruptive prominences show a strong tendency\r\ntoward the regions of sun spots and faculæ as if all three were\r\nintimately related phenomena.\r\n\r\n126. THE SUN AS A MACHINE.--Thus far we have considered the anatomy of\r\nthe sun, dissecting it into its several parts, and our next step should\r\nbe a consideration of its physiology, the relation of the parts to each\r\nother, and their function in carrying on the work of the solar organism,\r\nbut this step, unfortunately, must be a lame one. The science of\r\nastronomy to-day possesses no comprehensive and well-established theory\r\nof this kind, but looks to the future for the solution of this the\r\ngreatest pending problem of solar physics. Progress has been made\r\ntoward its solution, and among the steps of this progress that we shall\r\nhave to consider, the first and most important is the conception of the\r\nsun as a kind of heat engine.\r\n\r\nIn a steam engine coal is burned under the boiler, and its chemical\r\nenergy, transformed into heat, is taken up by the water and delivered,\r\nthrough steam as a medium, to the engine, which again transforms and\r\ngives it out as mechanical work in the turning of shafts, the driving of\r\nmachinery, etc. Now, the function of the sun is exactly opposite to that\r\nof the engine and boiler: it gives out, instead of receiving, radiant\r\nenergy; but, like the engine, it must be fed from some source; it can\r\nnot be run upon nothing at all any more than the engine can run day\r\nafter day without fresh supplies of fuel under its boiler. We know that\r\nfor some thousands of years the sun has been furnishing light and heat\r\nto the earth in practically unvarying amount, and not to the earth\r\nalone, but it has been pouring forth these forms of energy in every\r\ndirection, without apparent regard to either use or economy. Of all the\r\nradiant energy given off by the sun, only two parts out of every\r\nthousand million fall upon any planet of the solar system, and of this\r\nsmall fraction the earth takes about one tenth for the maintenance of\r\nits varied forms of life and action. Astronomers and physicists have\r\nsought on every hand for an explanation of the means by which this\r\ntremendous output of energy is maintained century after century without\r\nsensible diminution, and have come with almost one mind to the\r\nconclusion that the gravitative forces which reside in the sun's own\r\nmass furnish the only adequate explanation for it, although they may be\r\nin some small measure re-enforced by minor influences, such as the fall\r\nof meteoric dust and stones into the sun.\r\n\r\nEvery boy who has inflated a bicycle tire with a hand pump knows that\r\nthe pump grows warm during the operation, on account of the compression\r\nof the air within the cylinder. A part of the muscular force (energy)\r\nexpended in working the pump reappears in the heat which warms both air\r\nand pump, and a similar process is forever going on in the sun, only in\r\nplace of muscular force we must there substitute the tremendous\r\nattraction of gravitation, 28 times as great as upon the earth. \"The\r\nmatter in the interior of the sun must be as a shuttlecock between the\r\nstupendous pressure and the enormously high temperature,\" the one\r\ntending to compress and the other to expand it, but with this important\r\ndifference between them: the temperature steadily tends to fall as the\r\nheat energy is wasted away, while the gravitative force suffers no\r\ncorresponding diminution, and in the long run must gain the upper hand,\r\ncausing the sun to shrink and become more dense. It is this progressive\r\nshrinking and compression of its molecules into a smaller space which\r\nsupplies the energy contained in the sun's output of light and heat.\r\nAccording to Lord Kelvin, each centimeter of shrinkage in the sun's\r\ndiameter furnishes the energy required to keep up its radiation for\r\nsomething more than an hour, and, on account of the sun's great\r\ndistance, the shrinkage might go on at this rate for many centuries\r\nwithout producing any measurable effect in the sun's appearance.\r\n\r\n127. GASEOUS CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN.--But Helmholtz's dynamical theory\r\nof the maintenance of the sun's heat, which we are here considering,\r\nincludes one essential feature that is not sufficiently stated above. In\r\norder that the explanation may hold true, it is necessary that the sun\r\nshould be in the main a gaseous body, composed from center to\r\ncircumference of gases instead of solid or liquid parts. Pumping air\r\nwarms the bicycle pump in a way that pumping water or oil will not.\r\n\r\nThe high temperature of the sun itself furnishes sufficient reason for\r\nsupposing the solar material to be in the gaseous state, but the gas\r\ncomposing those parts of the sun below the photosphere must be very\r\ndifferent in some of its characteristics from the air or other gases\r\nwith which we are familiar at the earth, since its average density is\r\n1,000 times as great as that of air, and its consistence and mechanical\r\nbehavior must be more like that of honey or tar than that of any gas\r\nwith which we are familiar. It is worth noting, however, that if a hole\r\nwere dug into the crust of the earth to a depth of 15 or 20 miles the\r\nair at the bottom of the hole would be compressed by that above it to a\r\ndensity comparable with that of the solar gases.\r\n\r\n128. THE SUN'S CIRCULATION.--It is plain that under the conditions which\r\nexist in the sun the outer portions, which can radiate their heat freely\r\ninto space, must be cooler than the inner central parts, and this\r\ndifference of temperature must set up currents of hot matter drifting\r\nupward and outward from within the sun and counter currents of cooler\r\nmatter settling down to take its place. So, too, there must be some\r\nlevel at which the free radiation into outer space chills the hot matter\r\nsufficiently to condense its less refractory gases into clouds made up\r\nof liquid drops, just as on a cloudy day there is a level in our own\r\natmosphere at which the vapor of water condenses into liquid drops which\r\nform the thin shell of clouds that hovers above the earth's surface,\r\nwhile above and below is the gaseous atmosphere. In the case of the sun\r\nthis cloud layer is always present and is that part which we have\r\nlearned to call the photosphere. Above the photosphere lies the\r\nchromosphere, composed of gases less easily liquefied, hydrogen is the\r\nchief one, while between photosphere and chromosphere is a thin layer of\r\nmetallic vapors, perhaps indistinguishable from the top crust of the\r\nphotosphere itself, which by absorbing the light given off from the\r\nliquid photosphere produces the greater part of the Fraunhofer lines in\r\nthe solar spectrum.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the hot matter struggling up from below breaks through\r\nthe photosphere and, carrying with it a certain amount of the metallic\r\nvapors, is launched into the upper and cooler regions of the sun,\r\nwhere, parting with its heat, it falls back again upon the photosphere\r\nand is absorbed into it. It is altogether probable that the corona is\r\nchiefly composed of fine particles ejected from the sun with velocities\r\nsufficient to carry them to a height of millions of miles, or even\r\nsufficient to carry them off never to return. The matter of the corona\r\nmust certainly be in a state of the most lively agitation, its particles\r\nbeing alternately hurled up from the photosphere and falling back again\r\nlike fireworks, the particles which make up the corona of to-day being\r\nquite a different set from those of yesterday or last week. It seems\r\nbeyond question that the prominences and faculæ too are produced in some\r\nway by this up-and-down circulation of the sun's matter, and that any\r\nmechanical explanation of the sun must be worked out along these lines;\r\nbut the problem is an exceedingly difficult one, and must include and\r\nexplain many other features of the sun's activity of which only a few\r\ncan be considered here.\r\n\r\n129. THE SUN-SPOT PERIOD.--Sun spots come and go, and at best any\r\nparticular spot is but short-lived, rarely lasting more than a month or\r\ntwo, and more often its duration is a matter of only a few days. They\r\nare not equally numerous at all times, but, like swarms of locusts, they\r\nseem to come and abound for a season and then almost to disappear, as if\r\nthe forces which produced them were of a periodic character alternately\r\nactive and quiet. The effect of this periodic activity since 1870 is\r\nshown in Fig. 81, where the horizontal line is a scale of times, and the\r\ndistance of the curve above this line for any year shows the relative\r\nnumber of spots which appeared upon the sun in that year. This indicates\r\nvery plainly that 1870, 1883, and 1893 were years of great sun-spot\r\nactivity, while 1879 and 1889 were years in which few spots appeared.\r\nThe older records, covering a period of two centuries, show the same\r\nfluctuations in the frequency of sun spots and from these records\r\ncurves (which may be found in Young's, The Sun) have been plotted,\r\nshowing a succession of waves extending back for many years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--The curve of sun-spot frequency.]\r\n\r\nThe sun-spot period is the interval of time from the crest or hollow of\r\none wave to the corresponding part of the next one, and on the average\r\nthis appears to be a little more than eleven years, but is subject to\r\nconsiderable variation. In accordance with this period there is drawn in\r\nbroken lines at the right of Fig. 81 a predicted continuation of the\r\nsun-spot curve for the first decade of the twentieth century. The\r\nirregularity shown by the three preceding waves is such that we must not\r\nexpect the actual course of future sun spots to correspond very closely\r\nto the prediction here made; but in a general way 1901 and 1911 will\r\nprobably be years of few sun spots, while they will be numerous in 1905,\r\nbut whether more or less numerous than at preceding epochs of greatest\r\nfrequency can not be foretold with any approach to certainty so long as\r\nwe remain in our present ignorance of the causes which make the sun-spot\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nDetermine from Fig. 81 as accurately as possible the length of the\r\nsun-spot period. It is hard to tell the exact position of a crest or\r\nhollow of the curve. Would it do to draw a horizontal line midway\r\nbetween top and bottom of the curve and determine the length of the\r\nperiod from its intersections with the curve--e. g., in 1874 and 1885?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Illustrating change of the sun-spot zones.]\r\n\r\n130. THE SUN-SPOT ZONES.--It has been already noted that sun spots are\r\nfound only in certain zones of latitude upon the sun, and that faculæ\r\nand eruptive prominences abound in these zones more than elsewhere,\r\nalthough not strictly confined to them. We have now to note a\r\npeculiarity of these zones which ought to furnish a clew to the sun's\r\nmechanism, although up to the present time it has not been successfully\r\ntraced out. Just before a sun-spot minimum the few spots which appear\r\nare for the most part clustered near the sun's equator. As these spots\r\ndie out two new groups appear, one north the other south of the sun's\r\nequator and about 25° or 30° distant from it, and as the period advances\r\ntoward a maximum these groups shift their positions more and more toward\r\nthe equator, thus approaching each other but leaving between them a\r\nvacant lane, which becomes steadily narrower until at the close of the\r\nperiod, when the next minimum is at hand, it reaches its narrowest\r\ndimensions, but does not altogether close up even then. In Fig. 82 these\r\nrelations are shown for the period falling between 1879 and 1890, by\r\nmeans of the horizontal lines; for each year one line in the northern\r\nand one in the southern hemisphere of the sun, their lengths being\r\nproportional to the number of spots which appeared in the corresponding\r\nhemisphere during the year, and their positions on the sun's disk\r\nshowing the average latitude of the spots in question. It is very\r\napparent from the figure that during this decade the sun's southern\r\nhemisphere was much more active than the northern one in the production\r\nof spots, and this appears to be generally the case, although the\r\ndifference is not usually as great as in this particular decade.\r\n\r\n131. INFLUENCE OF THE SUN-SPOT PERIOD.--Sun spots are certainly less hot\r\nthan the surrounding parts of the sun's surface, and, in view of the\r\nintimate dependence of the earth upon the solar radiation, it would be\r\nin no way surprising if their presence or absence from the sun's face\r\nshould make itself felt in some degree upon the earth, raising and\r\nlowering its temperature and quite possibly affecting it in other ways.\r\nIngenious men have suggested many such kinds of influence, which,\r\naccording to their investigations, appear to run in cycles of eleven\r\nyears. Abundant and scanty harvests, cyclones, tornadoes, epidemics,\r\nrainfall, etc., are among these alleged effects, and it is possible that\r\nthere may be a real connection between any or all of them and the\r\nsun-spot period, but for the most part astronomers are inclined to hold\r\nthat there is only one case in which the evidence is strong enough to\r\nreally establish a connection of this kind. The magnetic condition of\r\nthe earth and its disturbances, which are called magnetic storms, do\r\ncertainly follow in a very marked manner the course of sun-spot\r\nactivity, and perhaps there should be added to this the statement that\r\nauroras (northern lights) stand in close relation to these magnetic\r\ndisturbances and are most frequent at the times of sun-spot maxima.\r\n\r\nUpon the sun, however, the influence of the spot period is not limited\r\nto things in and near the photosphere, but extends to the outermost\r\nlimits of the corona. Determine from Fig. 81 the particular part of the\r\nsun-spot period corresponding to the date of each picture of the corona\r\nand note how the pictures which were taken near times of sun-spot minima\r\npresent a general agreement in the shape and extent of the corona, while\r\nthe pictures taken at a time of maximum activity of the sun spots show a\r\nvery differently shaped and much smaller corona.\r\n\r\n132. THE LAW OF THE SUN'S ROTATION.--We have seen in a previous part of\r\nthe chapter how the time required by the sun to make a complete rotation\r\nupon its axis may be determined from photographs showing the progress of\r\na spot or group of spots across its disk, and we have now to add that\r\nwhen this is done systematically by means of many spots situated in\r\ndifferent solar latitudes it leads to a very peculiar and extraordinary\r\nresult. Each particular parallel of latitude has its own period of\r\nrotation different from that of its neighbors on either side, so that\r\nthere can be no such thing as a fixed geography of the sun's surface.\r\nEvery part of it is constantly taking up a new position with respect to\r\nevery other part, much as if the Gulf of Mexico should be south of the\r\nUnited States this year, southeast of it next year, and at the end of a\r\ndecade should have shifted around to the opposite side of the earth from\r\nus. A meridian of longitude drawn down the Mississippi Valley remains\r\nalways a straight line, or, rather, great circle, upon the surface of\r\nthe earth, while Fig. 83 shows what would become of such a meridian\r\ndrawn through the equatorial parts of the sun's disk. In the first\r\ndiagram it appears as a straight line running down the middle of the\r\nsun's disk. Twenty-five days later, when the same face of the sun comes\r\nback into view again, after making a complete revolution about the axis,\r\nthe equatorial parts will have moved so much faster and farther than\r\nthose in higher latitudes that the meridian will be warped as in the\r\nsecond diagram, and still more warped after another and another\r\nrevolution, as shown in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Effect of the sun's peculiar rotation in\r\nwarping a meridian, originally straight.]\r\n\r\nAt least such is the case if the spots truly represent the way in which\r\nthe sun turns round. There is, however, a possibility that the spots\r\nthemselves drift with varying speeds across the face of the sun, and\r\nthat the differences which we find in their rates of motion belong to\r\nthem rather than to the photosphere. Just what happens in the regions\r\nnear the poles is hard to say, for the sun spots only extend about\r\nhalfway from the equator to the poles, and the spectroscope, which may\r\nbe made to furnish a certain amount of information bearing upon the\r\ncase, is not as yet altogether conclusive, nor are the faculæ which have\r\nalso been observed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe simple theory that the solar phenomena are caused by an interchange\r\nof hotter and cooler matter between the photosphere and the lower strata\r\nof the sun furnishes in its present shape little or no explanation of\r\nsuch features as the sun-spot period, the variations in the corona, the\r\npeculiar character of the sun's rotation, etc., and we have still\r\nunsolved in the mechanical theory of the sun one of the noblest problems\r\nof astronomy, and one upon which both observers and theoretical\r\nastronomers are assiduously working at the present time. A close watch\r\nis kept upon sun spots and prominences, the corona is observed at every\r\ntotal eclipse, and numerous are the ingenious methods which are being\r\nsuggested and tried for observing it without an eclipse in ordinary\r\ndaylight. Attempts, more or less plausible, have been made and are now\r\npending to explain photosphere, spots and the reversing layer by means\r\nof the refraction of light within the sun's outer envelope of gases, and\r\nit seems altogether probable, in view of these combined activities, that\r\na considerable addition to our store of knowledge concerning the sun may\r\nbe expected in the not distant future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS\r\n\r\n\r\n133. PLANETS.--Circling about the sun, under the influence of his\r\nattraction, is a family of planets each member of which is, like the\r\nmoon, a dark body shining by reflected sunlight, and therefore\r\npresenting phases; although only two of them, Mercury and Venus, run\r\nthrough the complete series--new, first quarter, full, last\r\nquarter--which the moon presents. The way in which their orbits are\r\ngrouped about the sun has been considered in Chapter III, and Figs. 16\r\nand 17 of that chapter may be completed so as to represent all of the\r\nplanets by drawing in Fig. 16 two circles with radii of 7.9 and 12.4\r\ncentimeters respectively, to represent the orbits of the planets Uranus\r\nand Neptune, which are more remote from the sun than Saturn, and by\r\nintroducing a little inside the orbit of Jupiter about 500 ellipses of\r\ndifferent sizes, shapes, and positions to represent a group of minor\r\nplanets or asteroids as they are often called. It is convenient to\r\nregard these asteroids as composing by themselves a class of very small\r\nplanets, while the remaining 8 larger planets fall naturally into two\r\nother classes, a group of medium-sized ones--Mercury, Venus, Earth, and\r\nMars--called inner planets by reason of their nearness to the sun; and\r\nthe outer planets--Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune--each of which is\r\nmuch larger and more massive than any planet of the inner group. Compare\r\nin Figs. 84 and 85 their relative sizes. The earth, _E_, is introduced\r\ninto Fig. 85 as a connecting link between the two figures.\r\n\r\nSome of these planets, like the earth, are attended by one or more\r\nmoons, technically called satellites, which also shine by reflected\r\nsunlight and which move about their respective planets in accordance\r\nwith the law of gravitation, much as the moon moves around the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--The inner planets and the moon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--The outer planets.]\r\n\r\n134. DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS FROM THE SUN.--It is a comparatively\r\nsimple matter to observe these planets year after year as they move\r\namong the stars, and to find from these observations how long each one\r\nof them requires to make its circuit around the sun--that is, its\r\nperiodic time, _T_, which figures in Kepler's Third Law, and when these\r\nperiodic times have been ascertained, to use them in connection with\r\nthat law to determine the mean distance of each planet from the sun.\r\nThus, Jupiter requires 4,333 days to move completely around its orbit;\r\nand comparing this with the periodic time and mean distance of the earth\r\nwe find--\r\n\r\n    a^{3} / (4333^{2}) = (93,000,000^{3}) / (365.25^{2}),\r\n\r\nwhich when solved gives as the mean distance of Jupiter from the sun,\r\n483,730,000 miles, or 5.20 times as distant as the earth. If we make a\r\nsimilar computation for each planet, we shall find that their distances\r\nfrom the sun show a remarkable agreement with an artificial series of\r\nnumbers called Bode's law. We write down the numbers contained in the\r\nfirst line of figures below, each of which, after the second, is\r\nobtained by doubling the preceding one, add 4 to each number and point\r\noff one place of decimals; the resulting number is (approximately) the\r\ndistance of the corresponding planet from the sun.\r\n\r\n Mercury.  Venus.  Earth.  Mars.    Jupiter.  Saturn.  Uranus.  Neptune.\r\n    0        3       6      12   24   48        96       192      384\r\n    4        4       4       4    4    4         4         4        4\r\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   0.4      0.7     1.0    1.6  2.8  5.2      10.0      19.6     38.8\r\n   0.4      0.7     1.0    1.5  2.8  5.2       9.5      19.2     30.1\r\n\r\nThe last line of figures shows the real distance of the planet as\r\ndetermined from Kepler's law, the earth's mean distance from the sun\r\nbeing taken as the unit for this purpose. With exception of Neptune, the\r\nagreement between Bode's law and the true distances is very striking,\r\nbut most remarkable is the presence in the series of a number, 2.8, with\r\nno planet corresponding to it. This led astronomers at the time Bode\r\npublished the law, something more than a century ago, to give new heed\r\nto a suggestion made long before by Kepler, that there might be an\r\nunknown planet moving between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and a\r\nnumber of them agreed to search for such a planet, each in a part of the\r\nsky assigned him for that purpose. But they were anticipated by Piazzi,\r\nan Italian, who found the new planet, by accident, on the first day of\r\nthe nineteenth century, moving at a distance from the sun represented by\r\nthe number 2.77.\r\n\r\nThis planet was the first of the asteroids, and in the century that has\r\nelapsed hundreds of them have been discovered, while at the present time\r\nno year passes by without several more being added to the number. While\r\nsome of these are nearer to the sun than is the first one discovered,\r\nand others are farther from it, their average distance is fairly\r\nrepresented by the number 2.8.\r\n\r\nWhy Bode's law should hold true, or even so nearly true as it does, is\r\nan unexplained riddle, and many astronomers are inclined to call it no\r\nlaw at all, but only a chance coincidence--an illustration of the\r\n\"inherent capacity of figures to be juggled with\"; but if so, it is\r\npassing strange that it should represent the distance of the asteroids\r\nand of Uranus, which was also an undiscovered planet at the time the law\r\nwas published.\r\n\r\n135. THE PLANETS COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER.--When we pass from general\r\nconsiderations to a study of the individual peculiarities of the\r\nplanets, we find great differences in the extent of knowledge concerning\r\nthem, and the reason for this is not far to seek. Neptune and Uranus, at\r\nthe outskirts of the solar system, are so remote from us and so feebly\r\nillumined by the sun that any detailed study of them can go but little\r\nbeyond determining the numbers which represent their size, mass,\r\ndensity, the character of their orbits, etc. The asteroids are so small\r\nthat in the telescope they look like mere points of light, absolutely\r\nindistinguishable in appearance from the fainter stars. Mercury,\r\nalthough closer at hand and presenting a disk of considerable size,\r\nalways stands so near the sun that its observation is difficult on this\r\naccount. Something of the same kind is true for Venus, although in much\r\nless degree; while Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are comparatively easy\r\nobjects for telescopic study, and our knowledge of them, while far from\r\ncomplete, is considerably greater than for the other planets.\r\n\r\nFigs. 84 and 85 show the relative sizes of the planets composing the\r\ninner and outer groups respectively, and furnish the numerical data\r\nconcerning their diameters, masses, densities, etc., which are of most\r\nimportance in judging of their physical condition. Each planet, save\r\nSaturn, is represented by two circles, of which the outer is drawn\r\nproportional to the size of the planet, and the inner shows the amount\r\nof material that must be subtracted from the interior in order that the\r\nremaining shell shall just float in water. Note the great difference in\r\nthickness of shell between the two groups. Saturn, having a mean density\r\nless than that of water, must have something loaded upon it, instead of\r\nremoved, in order that it should float just submerged.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER\r\n\r\n136. APPEARANCE.--Commencing our consideration of the individual planets\r\nwith Jupiter, which is by far the largest of them, exceeding both in\r\nbulk and mass all the others combined, we have in Fig. 86 four\r\nrepresentations of Jupiter and his family of satellites as they may be\r\nseen in a very small telescope--e. g., an opera glass--save that the\r\nlittle dots which here represent the satellites are numbered _1_, _2_,\r\n_3_, _4_, in order to preserve their identity in the successive\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of these pictures lies in the satellites, but,\r\nreserving them for future consideration, we note that the planet itself\r\nresembles in shape the full moon, although in respect of brightness it\r\nsends to us less than 1/6000 part as much light as the moon. From a\r\nconsideration of the motion of Jupiter and the earth in Fig. 16, show\r\nthat Jupiter can not present any such phases as does the moon, but that\r\nits disk must be at all times nearly full. As seen from Saturn, what\r\nkind of phases would Jupiter present?\r\n\r\n137. THE BELTS.--Even upon the small scale of Fig. 86 we detect the most\r\ncharacteristic feature of Jupiter's appearance in the telescope, the two\r\nbands extending across his face parallel to the line of the satellites,\r\nand in Fig. 87 these same dark bands may be recognized amid the\r\nabundance of detail which is here brought out by a large telescope.\r\nPhotography does not succeed as a means of reproducing this detail, and\r\nfor it we have to rely upon the skill of the artist astronomer. The\r\nlettering shows the Pacific Standard time at which the sketches were\r\nmade, and also the longitude of the meridian of Jupiter passing down the\r\ncenter of the planet's disk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Jupiter and his satellites.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Drawings of Jupiter made at the 36-inch\r\ntelescope of the Lick Observatory.--KEELER.]\r\n\r\nThe dark bands are called technically the belts of Jupiter; and a\r\ncomparison of these belts in the second and third pictures of the group,\r\nin which nearly the same face of the planet is turned toward us, will\r\nshow that they are subject to considerable changes of form and position\r\neven within the space of a few days. So, too, by a comparison of such\r\nmarkings as the round white spots in the upper parts of the disks, and\r\nthe indentations in the edges of the belts, we may recognize that the\r\nplanet is in the act of turning round, and must therefore have an axis\r\nabout which it turns, and poles, an equator, etc. The belts are in fact\r\nparallel to the planet's equator; and generalizing from what appears in\r\nthe pictures, we may say that there is always a strongly marked belt on\r\neach side of the equator with a lighter colored streak between them,\r\nand that farther from the equator are other belts variable in number,\r\nless conspicuous, and less permanent than the two first seen. Compare\r\nthe position of the principal belts with the position of the zones of\r\nsun-spot activity in the sun. A feature of the planet's surface, which\r\ncan not be here reproduced, is the rich color effect to be found upon\r\nit. The principal belts are a brick-red or salmon color, the intervening\r\nspaces in general white but richly mottled, and streaked with purples,\r\nbrowns, and greens.\r\n\r\nThe drawings show the planet as it appeared in the telescope, inverted,\r\nand they must be turned upside down if we wish the points of the compass\r\nto appear as upon a terrestrial map. Bearing this in mind, note in the\r\nlast picture the great oval spot in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter.\r\nThis is a famous marking, known from its color as the _great red spot_,\r\nwhich appeared first in 1878 and has persisted to the present day\r\n(1900), sometimes the most conspicuous marking on the planet, at others\r\nreduced to a mere ghost of itself, almost invisible save for the\r\nindentation which it makes in the southern edge of the belt near it.\r\n\r\n138. ROTATION AND FLATTENING AT THE POLES.--One further significant fact\r\nwith respect to Jupiter may be obtained from a careful measurement of\r\nthe drawings; the planet is flattened at the poles, so that its polar\r\ndiameter is about one sixteenth part shorter than the equatorial\r\ndiameter. The flattening of the earth amounts to only one\r\nthree-hundredth part, and the marked difference between these two\r\nnumbers finds its explanation in the greater swiftness of Jupiter's\r\nrotation about its axis, since in both cases it is this rotation which\r\nmakes the flattening.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to determine the precise dimensions of the planet, since\r\nthis involves a knowledge both of its distance from us and of the angle\r\nsubtended by its diameter, but the most recent determinations of this\r\nkind assign as the equatorial diameter 90,200 miles, and for the polar\r\ndiameter 84,400 miles. Determine from either of these numbers the size\r\nof the great red spot.\r\n\r\nThe earth turns on its axis once in 24 hours but no such definite time\r\ncan be assigned to Jupiter, which, like the sun, seems to have different\r\nrotation periods in different latitudes--9h. 50m. in the equatorial belt\r\nand 9h. 56m. in the dark belts and higher latitudes. There is some\r\nindication that the larger part of the visible surface rotates in 9h.\r\n55.6m., while a broad stream along the equator flows eastward some 270\r\nmiles per hour, and thus comes back to the center of the planet, as seen\r\nfrom the earth, five or six minutes earlier than the parts which do not\r\nshare in this motion. Judged by terrestrial standards, 270 miles per\r\nhour is a great velocity, but Jupiter is constructed on a colossal\r\nscale, and, too, we have to compare this movement, not to a current\r\nflowing in the ocean, but to a wind blowing in the upper regions of the\r\nearth's atmosphere. The visible surface of Jupiter is only the top of a\r\ncloud formation, and contains nothing solid or permanent, if indeed\r\nthere is anything solid even at the core of the planet. The great red\r\nspot during the first dozen years of its existence, instead of remaining\r\nfixed relative to the surrounding formations, drifted two thirds of the\r\nway around the planet, and having come to a standstill about 1891, it is\r\nnow slowly retracing its path.\r\n\r\n139. PHYSICAL CONDITION.--For a better understanding of the physical\r\ncondition of Jupiter, we have now to consider some independent lines of\r\nevidence which agree in pointing to the conclusion that Jupiter,\r\nalthough classed with the earth as a planet, is in its essential\r\ncharacter much more like the sun.\r\n\r\n_Appearance._--The formations which we see in Fig. 87 look like clouds.\r\nThey gather and disappear, and the only element of permanence about them\r\nis their tendency to group themselves along zones of latitude. If we\r\nmeasure the light reflected from the planet we find that its albedo is\r\nvery high, like that of snow or our own cumulus clouds, and it is of\r\ncourse greater from the light parts of the disk than from the darker\r\nbands. The spectroscope shows that the sunlight reflected from these\r\ndarker belts is like that reflected from the lighter parts, save that a\r\nlarger portion of the blue and violet rays has been absorbed out of it,\r\nthus producing the ruddy tint of the belts, as sunset colors are\r\nproduced on the earth, and showing that here the light has penetrated\r\nfarther into the planet's atmosphere before being thrown back by\r\nreflection from lower-lying cloud surfaces. The dark bands are therefore\r\nto be regarded as rifts in the clouds, reaching down to some\r\nconsiderable distance and indicating an atmosphere of great depth. The\r\ngreat red spot, 28,000 miles long, and obviously thrusting back the\r\nwhite clouds on every side of it, year after year, can hardly be a mere\r\npatch on the face of the planet, but indicates some considerable depth\r\nof atmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Density._--So, too, the small mean density of the planet, only 1.3\r\ntimes that of water and actually less than the density of the sun,\r\nsuggests that the larger part of the planet's bulk may be made of gases\r\nand clouds, with very little solid matter even at the center; but here\r\nwe get into a difficulty from which there seems but one escape. The\r\nforce of gravity at the visible surface of Jupiter may be found from its\r\nmass and dimensions to be 2.6 times as great as at the surface of the\r\nearth, and the pressure exerted upon its atmosphere by this force ought\r\nto compress the lower strata into something more dense than we find in\r\nthe planet. Some idea of this compression may be obtained from Fig. 88,\r\nwhere the line marked _E_ shows approximately how the density of the air\r\nincreases as we move from its upper strata down toward the surface of\r\nthe earth through a distance of 16 miles, the density at any level being\r\nproportional to the distance of the curved line from the straight one\r\nnear it. The line marked _J_ in the same figure shows how the density\r\nwould increase if the force of gravity were as great here as it is in\r\nJupiter, and indicates a much greater rate of increase. Starting from\r\nthe upper surface of the cloud in Jupiter's atmosphere, if we descend,\r\nnot 16 miles, but 1,600 or 16,000, what must the density of the\r\natmosphere become and how is this to be reconciled with what we know to\r\nbe the very small mean density of the planet?\r\n\r\nWe are here in a dilemma between density on the one hand and the effects\r\nof gravity on the other, and the only escape from it lies in the\r\nassumption that the interior of Jupiter is tremendously hot, and that\r\nthis heat expands the substance of the planet in spite of the pressure\r\nto which it is subject, making a large planet with a low density,\r\npossibly gaseous at the very center, but in its outer part surrounded by\r\na shell of clouds condensed from the gases by radiating their heat into\r\nthe cold of outer space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Increase of density in the atmospheres of\r\nJupiter and the earth.]\r\n\r\nThis is essentially the same physical condition that we found for the\r\nsun, and we may add, as further points of resemblance between it and\r\nJupiter, that there seems to be a circulation of matter from the hot\r\ninterior of the planet to its cooler surface that is more pronounced in\r\nthe southern hemisphere than in the northern, and that has its periods\r\nof maximum and minimum activity, which, curiously enough, seem to\r\ncoincide with periods of maximum and minimum sun-spot development. Of\r\nthis, however, we can not be entirely sure, since it is only in recent\r\nyears that it has been studied with sufficient care, and further\r\nobservations are required to show whether the agreement is something\r\nmore than an accidental and short-lived coincidence.\r\n\r\n_Temperature._--The temperature of Jupiter must, of course, be much\r\nlower than that of the sun, since the surface which we see is not\r\nluminous like the sun's; but below the clouds it is not improbable that\r\nJupiter may be incandescent, white hot, and it is surmised with some\r\nshow of probability that a little of its light escapes through the\r\nclouds from time to time, and helps to produce the striking brilliancy\r\nwith which this planet shines.\r\n\r\n140. THE SATELLITES OF JUPITER.--The satellites bear much the same\r\nrelation to Jupiter that the moon bears to the earth, revolving about\r\nthe planet in accordance with the law of gravitation, and conforming to\r\nKepler's three laws, as do the planets in their courses about the sun.\r\nObserve in Fig. 86 the position of satellite No. _1_ on the four dates,\r\nand note how it oscillates back and forth from left to right of Jupiter,\r\napparently making a complete revolution in about two days, while No. _4_\r\nmoves steadily from left to right during the entire period, and has\r\nevidently made only a fraction of a revolution in the time covered by\r\nthe pictures. This quicker motion, of course, means that No. _1_ is\r\nnearer to Jupiter than No. _4_, and the numbers given to the satellites\r\nshow the order of their distances from the planet. The peculiar way in\r\nwhich the satellites are grouped, always standing nearly in a straight\r\nline, shows that their orbits must lie nearly in the same plane, and\r\nthat this plane, which is also the plane of the planets' equator, is\r\nturned edgewise toward the earth.\r\n\r\nThese satellites enjoy the distinction of being the first objects ever\r\ndiscovered with the telescope, having been found by Galileo almost\r\nimmediately after its invention, A. D. 1610. It is quite possible that\r\nbefore this time they may have been seen with the naked eye, for in more\r\nrecent years reports are current that they have been seen under\r\nfavorable circumstances by sharp-eyed persons, and very little\r\ntelescopic aid is required to show them. Look for them with an opera or\r\nfield glass. They bear the names Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, which,\r\nhowever, are rarely used, and, following the custom of astronomers, we\r\nshall designate them by the Roman numerals I, II, III, IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Orbits of Jupiter's satellites.]\r\n\r\nFor nearly three centuries (1610 to 1892) astronomers spoke of the four\r\nsatellites of Jupiter; but in September, 1892, a fifth one was added to\r\nthe number by Professor Barnard, who, observing with the largest\r\ntelescope then extant, found very close to Jupiter a tiny object only\r\n1/600 part as bright as the other satellites, but, like them, revolving\r\naround Jupiter, a permanent member of his system. This is called the\r\nfifth satellite, and Fig. 89 shows the orbits of these satellites around\r\nJupiter, which is here represented on the same scale as the orbits\r\nthemselves. The broken line just inside the orbit of I represents the\r\nsize of the moon's orbit. The cut shows also the periodic times of the\r\nsatellites expressed in days, and furnishes in this respect a striking\r\nillustration of the great mass of Jupiter. Satellite I is a little\r\nfarther from Jupiter than is the moon from the earth, but under the\r\ninfluence of a greater attraction it makes the circuit of its orbit in\r\n1.77 days, instead of taking 29.53 days, as does the moon. Determine\r\nfrom the figure by the method employed in § 111 how much more massive is\r\nJupiter than the earth.\r\n\r\nSmall as these satellites seem in Fig. 86, they are really bodies of\r\nconsiderable size, as appears from Fig. 90, where their dimensions are\r\ncompared with those of the earth and moon, save that the fifth satellite\r\nis not included. This one is so small as to escape all attempts at\r\nmeasuring its diameter, but, judging from the amount of light it\r\nreflects, the period printed with the legend of the figure represents a\r\ngross exaggeration of this satellite's size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Jupiter's satellites compared with the earth\r\nand moon.]\r\n\r\nLike the moon, each of these satellites may fairly be considered a world\r\nin itself, and as such a fitting object of detailed study, but,\r\nunfortunately, their great distance from us makes it impossible, even\r\nwith the most powerful telescope, to see more upon their surfaces than\r\noccasional vague markings, which hardly suffice to show the rotations of\r\nthe satellites upon their axes.\r\n\r\nOne striking feature, however, comes out from a study of their influence\r\nin disturbing each other's motion about Jupiter. Their masses and the\r\nresulting densities of the satellites are smaller than we should have\r\nexpected to find, the density being less than that of the moon, and\r\naveraging only a little greater than the density of Jupiter itself. At\r\nthe surface of the third satellite the force of gravity is but little\r\nless than on the moon, although the moon's density is nearly twice as\r\ngreat as that of III, and there can be no question here of accounting\r\nfor the low density through expansion by great heat, as in the case of\r\nthe sun and Jupiter. It has been surmised that these satellites are not\r\nsolid bodies, like the earth and moon, but only shoals of rock and\r\nstone, loosely piled together and kept from packing into a solid mass by\r\nthe action of Jupiter in raising tides within them. But the explanation\r\ncan hardly be regarded as an accepted article of astronomical belief,\r\nalthough it is supported by some observations which tend to show that\r\nthe apparent shapes of the satellites change under the influence of the\r\ntidal forces impressed upon them.\r\n\r\n141. ECLIPSES OF THE SATELLITES.--It may be seen from Fig. 89 that in\r\ntheir motion around the planet Jupiter's satellites must from time to\r\ntime pass through his shadow and be eclipsed, and that the shadows of\r\nthe satellites will occasionally fall upon the planet, producing to an\r\nobserver upon Jupiter an eclipse of the sun, but to an observer on the\r\nearth presenting only the appearance of a round black spot moving slowly\r\nacross the face of the planet. Occasionally also a satellite will pass\r\nexactly between the earth and Jupiter, and may be seen projected against\r\nthe planet as a background. All of these phenomena are duly predicted\r\nand observed by astronomers, but the eclipses are the only ones we need\r\nconsider here. The importance of these eclipses was early recognized,\r\nand astronomers endeavored to construct a theory of their recurrence\r\nwhich would permit accurate predictions of them to be made. But in this\r\nthey met with no great success, for while it was easy enough to foretell\r\non what night an eclipse of a given satellite would occur, and even to\r\nassign the hour of the night, it was not possible to make the predicted\r\nminute agree with the actual time of eclipse until after Roemer, a\r\nDanish astronomer of the seventeenth century, found where lay the\r\ntrouble. His discovery was, that whenever the earth was on the side of\r\nits orbit toward Jupiter the eclipses really occurred before the\r\npredicted time, and when the earth was on the far side of its orbit they\r\ncame a few minutes later than the predicted time. He correctly inferred\r\nthat this was to be explained, not by any influence which the earth\r\nexerted upon Jupiter and his satellites, but through the fact that the\r\nlight by which we see the satellite and its eclipse requires an\r\nappreciable time to cross the intervening space, and a longer time when\r\nthe earth is far from Jupiter than when it is near.\r\n\r\nFor half a century Roemer's views found little credence, but we know now\r\nthat he was right, and that on the average the eclipses come 8m. 18s.\r\nearly when the earth is nearest to Jupiter, and 8m. 18s. late when it is\r\non the opposite side of its orbit. This is equivalent to saying that\r\nlight takes 8m. 18s. to cover the distance from the sun to the earth, so\r\nthat at any moment we see the sun not as it then is, but as it was 8\r\nminutes earlier. It has been found possible in recent years to measure\r\nby direct experiment the velocity with which light travels--186,337\r\nmiles per second--and multiplying this number by the 498s. (= 8m. 18s.)\r\nwe obtain a new determination of the sun's distance from the earth. The\r\nproduct of the two numbers is 92,795,826, in very fair agreement with\r\nthe 93,000,000 miles found in Chapter X; but, as noted there, this\r\nmethod, like every other, has its weak side, and the result may be a\r\ngood many thousands of miles in error.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note in this connection that both methods of obtaining\r\nthe sun's distance which were given in Chapter X involve Kepler's Third\r\nLaw, while the result obtained from Jupiter's satellites is entirely\r\nindependent of this law, and the agreement of the several results is\r\ntherefore good evidence both for the truth of Kepler's laws and for the\r\nsoundness of Roemer's explanation of the eclipses. This mode of proof,\r\nby comparing the numerical results furnished by two or more different\r\nprinciples, and showing that they agree or disagree, is of wide\r\napplication and great importance in physical science.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURN\r\n\r\n142. THE RING OF SATURN.--In respect of size and mass Saturn stands next\r\nto Jupiter, and although far inferior to him in these respects, it\r\ncontains more material than all the remaining planets combined. But the\r\nunique feature of Saturn which distinguishes it from every other known\r\nbody in the heavens is its ring, which was long a puzzle to the\r\nastronomers who first studied the planet with a telescope (one of them\r\ncalled Saturn a planet with ears), but, was after nearly half a century\r\ncorrectly understood and described by Huyghens, whose Latin text we\r\ntranslate into--\"It is surrounded by a ring, thin, flat, nowhere\r\ntouching it, and making quite an angle with the ecliptic.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Aspects of Saturn's rings.]\r\n\r\nCompare with this description Fig. 91, which shows some of the\r\nappearances presented by the ring at different positions of Saturn in\r\nits orbit. It was their varying aspects that led Huyghens to insert the\r\nlast words of his description, for, if the plane of the ring coincided\r\nwith the plane of the earth's orbit, then at all times the ring must be\r\nturned edgewise toward the earth, as shown in the middle picture of the\r\ngroup. Fig. 92 shows the sun and the orbit of the earth placed near the\r\ncenter of Saturn's orbit, across whose circumference are ruled some\r\noblique lines representing the plane of the ring, the right end always\r\ntilted up, no matter where the planet is in its orbit. It is evident\r\nthat an observer upon the earth will see the _N_ side of the ring when\r\nthe planet is at _N_ and the _S_ side when it is at _S_, as is shown in\r\nthe first and third pictures of Fig. 91, while midway between these\r\npositions the edge of the ring will be presented to the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Aspects of the ring in their relation to\r\nSaturn's orbital motion.]\r\n\r\nThe last occasion of this kind was in October, 1891, and with the large\r\ntelescope of the Washburn Observatory the writer at that time saw\r\nSaturn without a trace of a ring surrounding it. The ring is so thin\r\nthat it disappears altogether when turned edgewise. The names of the\r\nzodiacal constellations are inserted in Fig. 92 in their proper\r\ndirection from the sun, and from these we learn that the ring will\r\ndisappear, or be exceedingly narrow, whenever Saturn is in the\r\nconstellation Pisces or near the boundary line between Leo and Virgo. It\r\nwill be broad and show its northern side when Saturn is in Scorpius or\r\nSagittarius, and its southern face when the planet is in Gemini. What\r\nwill be its appearance in 1907 at the date marked in the figure?\r\n\r\n143. NATURE OF THE RING.--It is apparent from Figs. 91 and 93 that\r\nSaturn's ring is really made up of two or more rings lying one inside of\r\nthe other and completely separated by a dark space which, though narrow,\r\nis as clean and sharp as if cut with a knife. Also, the inner edge of\r\nthe ring fades off into an obscure border called the _dusky ring_ or\r\n_crape ring_. This requires a pretty good telescope to show it, as may\r\nbe inferred from the fact that it escaped notice for more than two\r\ncenturies during which the planet was assiduously studied with\r\ntelescopes, and was discovered at the Harvard College Observatory as\r\nrecently as 1850.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rings appear oval in all of the pictures, this is mainly an\r\neffect of perspective, and they are in fact nearly circular with the\r\nplanet at their center. The extreme diameter of the ring is 172,000\r\nmiles, and from this number, by methods already explained (Chapter IX),\r\nthe student should obtain the width of the rings, their distance from\r\nthe ball of the planet, and the diameter of the ball. As to thickness,\r\nit is evident, from the disappearance of the ring when its edge is\r\nturned toward the earth, that it is very thin in comparison with its\r\ndiameter, probably not more than 100 miles thick, although no exact\r\nmeasurement of this can be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Saturn.]\r\n\r\nFrom theoretical reasons based upon the law of gravitation astronomers\r\nhave held that the rings of Saturn could not possibly be solid or\r\nliquid bodies. The strains impressed upon them by the planet's\r\nattraction would tear into fragments steel rings made after their size\r\nand shape. Quite recently Professor Keeler has shown, by applying the\r\nspectroscope (Doppler's principle) to determine the velocity of the\r\nring's rotation about Saturn, that the inner parts of the ring move, as\r\nKepler's Third Law requires, more rapidly than do the outer parts, thus\r\nfurnishing a direct proof that they are not solid, and leaving no doubt\r\nthat they are made up of separate fragments, each moving about the\r\nplanet in its own orbit, like an independent satellite, but standing so\r\nclose to its neighbors that the whole space reflects the sunlight as\r\ncompletely as if it were solid. With this understanding of the rings it\r\nis easy to see why they are so thin. Like Jupiter, Saturn is greatly\r\nflattened at the poles, and this flattening, or rather the protuberant\r\nmass about the equator, lays hold of every satellite near the planet and\r\nexerts upon it a direct force tending to thrust it down into the plane\r\nof the planet's equator and hold it there. The ring lies in the plane of\r\nSaturn's equator because each particle is constrained to move there.\r\n\r\nThe division of the ring into two parts, an outer and an inner ring, is\r\nusually explained as follows: Saturn is surrounded by a numerous brood\r\nof satellites, which by their attractions produce perturbations in the\r\nmaterial composing the rings, and the dividing line between the outer\r\nand inner rings falls at the place where by the law of gravitation the\r\nperturbations would have their greatest effect. The dividing line\r\nbetween the rings is therefore a narrow lane, 2,400 miles wide, from\r\nwhich the fragments have been swept clean away by the perturbing action\r\nof the satellites. Less conspicuous divisions are seen from time to time\r\nin other parts of the ring, where the perturbations, though less, are\r\nstill appreciable. But it is open to some question whether this\r\nexplanation is sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe curious darkness of the inner or crape ring is easily explained.\r\nThe particles composing it are not packed together so closely as in the\r\nouter ring, and therefore reflect less sunlight. Indeed, so sparsely\r\nstrewn are the particles in this ring that it is in great measure\r\ntransparent to the sunlight, as is shown by a recorded observation of\r\none of the satellites which was distinctly although faintly seen while\r\nmoving through the shadow of the dark ring, but disappeared in total\r\neclipse when it entered the shadow cast by the bright ring.\r\n\r\n144. THE BALL OF SATURN.--The ball of the planet is in most respects a\r\nsmaller copy of Jupiter. With an equatorial diameter of 76,000 miles, a\r\npolar diameter of 69,000 miles, and a mass 95 times that of the earth,\r\nits density is found to be the least of any planet in the solar system,\r\nonly 0.70 of the density of water, and about one half as great as is the\r\ndensity of Jupiter. The force of gravity at its surface is only a little\r\ngreater (1.18) than on the earth; and this, in connection with the low\r\ndensity, leads, as in the case of Jupiter, to the conclusion that the\r\nplanet must be mainly composed of gases and vapors, very hot within, but\r\ninclosed by a shell of clouds which cuts off their glow from our eyes.\r\n\r\nLike Jupiter in another respect, the planet turns very swiftly upon its\r\naxis, making a revolution in 10 hours 14 minutes, but up to the present\r\nit remains unknown whether different parts of the surface have different\r\nrotation times.\r\n\r\n145. THE SATELLITES.--Saturn is attended by a family of nine satellites,\r\na larger number than belongs to any other planet, but with one exception\r\nthey are exceedingly small and difficult to observe save with a very\r\nlarge telescope. Indeed, the latest one is said to have been discovered\r\nin 1898 by means of the image which it impressed upon a photographic\r\nplate, and it has never been _seen_.\r\n\r\nTitan, the largest of them, is distant 771,000 miles from the planet and\r\nbears much the same relation to Saturn that Satellite III bears to\r\nJupiter, the similarity in distance, size and mass being rather\r\nstriking, although, of course, the smaller mass of Saturn as compared\r\nwith Jupiter makes the periodic time of Titan--15 days 23 hours--much\r\ngreater than that of III. Can you apply Kepler's Third Law to the motion\r\nof Titan so as to determine from the data given above, the time required\r\nfor a particle at the outer or inner edge of the ring to revolve once\r\naround Saturn?\r\n\r\nJapetus, the second satellite in point of size, whose distance from\r\nSaturn is about ten times as great as the moon's distance from the\r\nearth, presents the remarkable peculiarity of being always brighter in\r\none part of its orbit than in another, three or four times as bright\r\nwhen west of Saturn as when east of it. This probably indicates that,\r\nlike our own moon, the satellite turns always the same face toward its\r\nplanet, and further, that one side of the satellite reflects the\r\nsunlight much better than the other side--i. e., has a higher albedo.\r\nWith these two assumptions it is easily seen that the satellite will\r\nalways turn toward the earth one face when west, and the other face when\r\neast of Saturn, and thus give the observed difference of brightness.\r\n\r\n\r\nURANUS AND NEPTUNE\r\n\r\n146. CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS.--The two remaining large planets are\r\ninteresting chiefly as modern additions to the known members of the\r\nsun's family. The circumstances leading to the discovery of Neptune have\r\nbeen touched upon in Chapter IV, and for Uranus we need only note that\r\nit was found by accident in the year 1781 by William Herschel, who for\r\nsome time after the discovery considered it to be only a comet. It was\r\nthe first planet ever discovered, all of its predecessors having been\r\nknown from prehistoric times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HERSCHEL (1738-1822).]\r\n\r\nUranus has four satellites, all of them very faint, which present only\r\none feature of special importance. Instead of moving in orbits which are\r\napproximately parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, as do the\r\nsatellites of the inner planets, their orbit planes are tipped up nearly\r\nperpendicular to the planes of the orbits of both Uranus and the earth.\r\nThe one satellite which Neptune possesses has the same peculiarity in\r\neven greater degree, for its motion around the planet takes place in the\r\ndirection opposite to that in which all the planets move around the sun,\r\nmuch as if the orbit of the satellite had been tipped over through an\r\nangle of 150°. Turn a watch face down and note how the hands go round in\r\nthe direction opposite to that in which they moved before the face was\r\nturned through 180°.\r\n\r\nBoth Uranus and Neptune are too distant to allow much detail to be seen\r\nupon their surfaces, but the presence of broad absorption bands in their\r\nspectra shows that they must possess dense atmospheres quite different\r\nin constitution from the atmosphere of the earth. In respect of density\r\nand the force of gravity at their surfaces, they are not very unlike\r\nSaturn, although their density is greater and gravity less than his,\r\nleading to the supposition that they are for the most part gaseous\r\nbodies, but cooler and probably more nearly solid than either Jupiter or\r\nSaturn.\r\n\r\nUnder favorable circumstances Uranus may be seen with the naked eye by\r\none who knows just where to look for it. Neptune is never visible save\r\nin a telescope.\r\n\r\n147. THE INNER PLANETS.--In sharp contrast with the giant planets which\r\nwe have been considering stands the group of four inner planets, or five\r\nif we count the moon as an independent body, which resemble each other\r\nin being all small, dense, and solid bodies, which by comparison with\r\nthe great distances separating the outer planets may fairly be described\r\nas huddled together close to the sun. Their relative sizes are shown in\r\nFig. 84, together with the numerical data concerning size, mass,\r\ndensity, etc., which we have already found important for the\r\nunderstanding of a planet's physical condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--The phases of Venus.--ANTONIADI.]\r\n\r\n148. APPEARANCE.--Omitting the earth, Venus is by far the most\r\nconspicuous member of this group, and when at its brightest is, with\r\nexception of the sun and moon, the most brilliant object in the sky, and\r\nmay be seen with the naked eye in broad daylight if the observer knows\r\njust where to look for it. But its brilliancy is subject to considerable\r\nvariations on account of its changing distance from the earth, and the\r\napparent size of its disk varies for the same reason, as may be seen\r\nfrom Fig. 94. These drawings bring out well the phases of the planet,\r\nand the student should determine from Fig. 17 what are the relative\r\npositions in their orbits of the earth and Venus at which the planet\r\nwould present each of these phases. As a guide to this, observe that the\r\ndark part of Venus's earthward side is always proportional in area to\r\nthe angle at Venus between the earth and sun. In the first picture of\r\nFig. 94 about two thirds of the surface corresponding to the full\r\nhemisphere of the planet is dark, and the angle at Venus between earth\r\nand sun is therefore two thirds of 180°--i. e., 120°. In Fig. 17 find a\r\nplace on the orbit of Venus from which if lines be drawn to the sun and\r\nearth, as there shown, the angle between them will be 120°. Make a\r\nsimilar construction for the fourth picture in Fig. 94. Which of these\r\ntwo positions is farther from the earth? How do the distances compare\r\nwith the apparent size of Venus in the two pictures? What is the phase\r\nof Venus to-day?\r\n\r\nThe irregularities in the shading of the illuminated parts of the disk\r\nare too conspicuous in Fig. 94, on account of difficulties of\r\nreproduction; these shadings are at the best hard to see in the\r\ntelescope, and distinct permanent markings upon the planet are wholly\r\nlacking. This absence of markings makes almost impossible a\r\ndetermination of the planet's time of rotation about its axis, and\r\nastronomers are divided in this respect into two parties, one of which\r\nmaintains that Venus, like the earth, turns upon its axis in some period\r\nnot very different from 24 hours, while the other contends that, like\r\nthe moon, it turns always the same face toward the center of its orbit,\r\nmaking a rotation upon its axis in the same period in which it makes a\r\nrevolution about the sun. The reason why no permanent markings are to be\r\nseen on this planet is easily found. Like Jupiter and Saturn, its\r\natmosphere is at all times heavily cloud-laden, so that we seldom, if\r\never, see down to the level of its solid parts. There is, however, no\r\nreason here to suppose the interior parts hot and gaseous. It is much\r\nmore probable that Venus, like the earth, possesses a solid crust whose\r\ntemperature we should expect to be considerably higher than that of the\r\nearth, because Venus is nearer the sun. But the cloud layer in its\r\natmosphere must modify the temperature in some degree, and we have\r\npractically no knowledge of the real temperature conditions at the\r\nsurface of the planet.\r\n\r\nIt is the clouds of Venus which in great measure are responsible for its\r\nmarked brilliancy, since they are an excellent medium for reflecting the\r\nsunlight, and give to its surface an albedo greater than that of any\r\nother planet, although Saturn is nearly equal to it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the presence of such cloud formations indicates that Venus is\r\nsurrounded by a dense atmosphere, and we have independent evidence of\r\nthis in the shape of its disk when the planet is very nearly between the\r\nearth and sun. The illuminated part, from tip to tip of the horns, then\r\nstretches more than halfway around the planet's circumference, and shows\r\nthat a certain amount of light must have been refracted through its\r\natmosphere, thus making the horns of the crescent appear unduly\r\nprolonged. This atmosphere is shown by the spectroscope to be not unlike\r\nthat of the earth, although, possibly, more dense.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY\r\n\r\n149. CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS.--Mercury, on account of its nearness to the\r\nsun, is at all times a difficult object to observe, and Copernicus, who\r\nspent most of his life in Poland, is said, despite all his efforts, to\r\nhave gone to his grave without ever seeing it. In our more southern\r\nlatitude it can usually be seen for about a fortnight at the time of\r\neach elongation--i. e., when at its greatest angular distance from the\r\nsun--and the student should find from Fig. 16 the time at which the next\r\nelongation occurs and look for the planet, shining like a star of the\r\nfirst magnitude, low down in the sky just after sunset or before\r\nsunrise, according as the elongation is to the east or west of the sun.\r\nWhen seen in the morning sky the planet grows brighter day after day\r\nuntil it disappears in the sun's rays, while in the evening sky its\r\nbrilliancy as steadily diminishes until the planet is lost. It should\r\ntherefore be looked for in the evening as soon as possible after it\r\nemerges from the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nMercury, as the smallest of the planets, is best compared with the\r\nmoon, which it does not greatly surpass in size and which it strongly\r\nresembles in other respects. Careful comparisons of the amount of light\r\nreflected by the planet in different parts of its orbit show not only\r\nthat its albedo agrees very closely with that of the moon, but also that\r\nits light changes with the varying phase of the planet in almost exactly\r\nthe same way as the amount of moonlight changes. We may therefore infer\r\nthat its surface is like that of the moon, a rough and solid one, with\r\nfew or no clouds hanging over it, and most probably covered with very\r\nlittle or no atmosphere. Like Venus, its rotation period is uncertain,\r\nwith the balance of probability favoring the view that it rotates upon\r\nits axis once in 88 days, and therefore always turns the same face\r\ntoward the sun.\r\n\r\nIf such is the case, its climate must be very peculiar: one side roasted\r\nin a perpetual day, where the direct heating power of the sun's rays,\r\nwhen the planet is at perihelion, is ten times as great as on the moon,\r\nand which six weeks later, when the planet is at its farthest from the\r\nsun, has fallen off to less than half of this. On the opposite side of\r\nthe planet there must reign perpetual night and perpetual cold,\r\nmitigated by some slight access of warmth from the day side, and perhaps\r\nfeebly imitating the rapid change of season which takes place on the day\r\nside of the planet. This view, however, takes no account of a possible\r\ndeviation of the planet's axis from being perpendicular to the plane of\r\nits orbit, or of the librations which must be produced by the great\r\neccentricity of the orbit, either of which would complicate without\r\nentirely destroying the ideal conditions outlined above.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARS\r\n\r\n150. APPEARANCE.--The one remaining member of the inner group, Mars, has\r\nin recent years received more attention than any other planet, and the\r\nnewspapers and magazines have announced marvelous things concerning it:\r\nthat it is inhabited by a race of beings superior in intelligence to\r\nmen; that the work of their hands may be seen upon the face of the\r\nplanet; that we should endeavor to communicate with them, if indeed they\r\nare not already sending messages to us, etc.--all of which is certainly\r\nimportant, if true, but it rests upon a very slender foundation of\r\nevidence, a part of which we shall have to consider.\r\n\r\nBeginning with facts of which there is no doubt, this ruddy-colored\r\nplanet, which usually shines about as brightly as a star of the first\r\nmagnitude, sometimes displays more than tenfold this brilliancy,\r\nsurpassing every other planet save Venus and presenting at these times\r\nespecially favorable opportunities for the study of its surface. The\r\nexplanation of this increase of brilliancy is, of course, that the\r\nplanet approaches unusually near to the earth, and we have already seen\r\nfrom a consideration of Fig. 17 that this can only happen in the months\r\nof August and September. The last favorable epoch of this kind was in\r\n1894. From Fig. 17 the student should determine when the next one will\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Mars.--SCHAEBERLE.]\r\n\r\nFig. 95 presents nine drawings of the planet made at one of the epochs\r\nof close approach to the earth, and shows that its face bears certain\r\nfaint markings which, though inconspicuous, are fixed and permanent\r\nfeatures of the planet. The dark triangular projection in the lower\r\nhalf of the second drawing was seen and sketched by Huyghens, 1659\r\nA. D. In Fig. 96 some of these markings are shown much more plainly, but\r\nFig. 95 gives a better idea of their usual appearance in the telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Four views of Mars differing 90° in\r\nlongitude.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\n151. ROTATION.--It may be seen readily enough, from a comparison of the\r\nfirst two sketches of Fig. 95, that the planet rotates about an axis,\r\nand from a more extensive study it is found to be very like the earth in\r\nthis respect, turning once in 24h. 37m. around an axis tipped from being\r\nperpendicular to the plane of its orbit about a degree and a half more\r\nthan is the earth's axis. Since it is this inclination of the axis which\r\nis the cause of changing seasons upon the earth, there must be similar\r\nchanges, winter and summer, as well as day and night, upon Mars, only\r\neach season is longer there than here in the same proportion that its\r\nyear is longer than ours--i. e., nearly two to one. It is summer in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere of Mars whenever the sun, as seen from Mars, stands\r\nin that constellation which is nearest the point of the sky toward which\r\nthe planet's axis points. But this axis points toward the constellation\r\nCygnus, and Alpha Cygni is the bright star nearest the north pole of\r\nMars. As Pisces is the zodiacal constellation nearest to Cygnus, it must\r\nbe summer in the northern hemisphere of Mars when the sun is in Pisces,\r\nor, turning the proposition about, it must be summer in the _southern_\r\nhemisphere of Mars when the planet, as seen from the sun, lies in the\r\ndirection of Pisces.\r\n\r\n152. THE POLAR CAPS.--One effect of the changing seasons upon Mars is\r\nshown in Fig. 97, where we have a series of drawings of the region about\r\nits south pole made in 1894, on dates between May 21st and December\r\n10th. Show from Fig. 17 that during this time it was summer in the\r\nregion here shown. Mars crossed the prime radius in 1894 on September\r\n5th. The striking thing in these pictures is the white spot surrounding\r\nthe pole, which shrinks in size from the beginning to near the end of\r\nthe series, and then disappears altogether. The spot came back again a\r\nyear later, and like a similar spot at the north pole of the planet it\r\nwaxes in the winter and wanes during the summer of Mars in endless\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--The south polar cap of Mars in 1894.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\nSir W. Herschel, who studied these appearances a century ago, compared\r\nthem with the snow fields which every winter spread out from the region\r\naround the terrestrial pole, and in the summer melt and shrink, although\r\nwith us they do not entirely disappear. This explanation of the polar\r\ncaps of Mars has been generally accepted among astronomers, and from it\r\nwe may draw one interesting conclusion: the temperature upon Mars\r\nbetween summer and winter oscillates above and below the freezing point\r\nof water, as it does in the temperate zones of the earth. But this\r\nconclusion plunges us into a serious difficulty. The temperature of the\r\nearth is made by the sun, and at the distance of Mars from the sun the\r\nheating effect of the latter is reduced to less than half what it is at\r\nthe earth, so that, if Mars is to be kept at the same temperature as the\r\nearth, there must be some peculiar means for storing the solar heat and\r\nusing it more economically than is done here. Possibly there is some\r\nsuch mechanism, although no one has yet found it, and some astronomers\r\nare very confident that it does not exist, and assert that the\r\ncomparison of the polar caps with snow fields is misleading, and that\r\nthe temperature upon Mars must be at least 100°, and perhaps 200° or\r\nmore, below zero.\r\n\r\n153. ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE.--In this connection one feature of Mars is\r\nof importance. The markings upon its surface are always visible when\r\nturned toward the earth, thus showing that the atmosphere contains no\r\nsuch amount of cloud as does our own, but on the whole is decidedly\r\nclear and sunny, and presumably much less dense than ours. We have seen\r\nin comparing the earth and the moon how important is the service which\r\nthe earth's atmosphere renders in storing the sun's heat and checking\r\nthose great vicissitudes of temperature to which the moon is subject;\r\nand with this in mind we must regard the smaller density and cloudless\r\ncharacter of the atmosphere of Mars as unfavorable to the maintenance\r\nthere of a temperature like that of the earth. Indeed, this\r\ncloudlessness must mean one of two things: either the temperature is so\r\nlow that vapors can not exist in any considerable quantity, or the\r\nsurface of Mars is so dry that there is little water or other liquid to\r\nbe evaporated. The latter alternative is adopted by those astronomers\r\nwho look upon the polar caps as true snow fields, which serve as the\r\nchief reservoir of the planet's water supply, and who find in Fig. 98\r\nevidence that as the snow melts and the water flows away over the flat,\r\ndry surface of the planet, vegetation springs up, as shown by the dark\r\nmarkings on the disk, and gradually dies out with the advancing season.\r\nNote that in the first of these pictures the season upon Mars\r\ncorresponds to the end of May with us, and in the last picture to the\r\nbeginning of August, a period during which in much of our western\r\ncountry the luxuriant vegetation of spring is burned out by the\r\nscorching sun. From this point of view the permanent dark spots are the\r\nlow-lying parts of the planet's surface, in which at all times there is\r\na sufficient accumulation of water to support vegetable life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--The same face of Mars at three different\r\nseasons.--LOWELL.]\r\n\r\n154. THE CANALS.--In Fig. 98 the lower part of the disk of Mars shows\r\ncertain faint dark lines which are generally called canals, and in Plate\r\nIII there is given a map of Mars showing many of these canals running in\r\nnarrow, dusky streaks across the face of the planet according to a\r\npattern almost as geometrical as that of a spider's web. This must not\r\nbe taken for a picture of the planet's appearance in a telescope. No man\r\never saw Mars look like this, but the map is useful as a plain\r\nrepresentation of things dimly seen. Some of the regions of this map are\r\nmarked Mare (sea), in accordance with the older view which regarded the\r\ndarker parts of the planet--and of the moon--as bodies of water, but\r\nthis is now known to be an error in both cases. The curved surface of a\r\nplanet can not be accurately reproduced upon the flat surface of paper,\r\nbut is always more or less distorted by the various methods of\r\n\"projecting\" it which are in use. Compare the map of Mars in Plate III\r\nwith Fig. 99, in which the projection represents very well the\r\nequatorial parts of the planet, but enormously exaggerates the region\r\naround the poles.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable feature of the canals that they all begin and end in\r\none of these dark parts of the planet's surface; they show no loose ends\r\nlying on the bright parts of the planet. Another even more remarkable\r\nfeature is that while the larger canals are permanent features of the\r\nplanet's surface, they at times appear \"doubled\"--i. e., in place of one\r\ncanal two parallel ones side by side, lasting for a time and then giving\r\nplace again to a single canal.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly difficult to frame any reasonable explanation of these\r\ncanals and the varied appearances which they present. The source of the\r\nwild speculations about Mars, to which reference is made above, is to be\r\nfound in the suggestion frequently made, half in jest and half in\r\nearnest, that the canals are artificial water courses constructed upon a\r\nscale vastly exceeding any public works upon the earth, and testifying\r\nto the presence in Mars of an advanced civilization. The distinguished\r\nItalian astronomer, Schiaparelli, who has studied these formations\r\nlonger than any one else, seems inclined to regard them as water courses\r\nlined on either side by vegetation, which flourishes as far back from\r\nthe central channel as water can be supplied from it--a plausible enough\r\nexplanation if the fundamental difficulty about temperature can be\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--A chart of Mars, 1898-'99.--CERULLI.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III. MAP OF MARS (AFTER SCHIAPARELLI)]\r\n\r\n155. SATELLITES.--In 1877, one of the times of near approach, Professor\r\nHall, of Washington, discovered two tiny satellites revolving about Mars\r\nin orbits so small that the nearer one, Phobos, presents the remarkable\r\nanomaly of completing the circuit of its orbit in less time than the\r\nplanet takes for a rotation about its axis. This satellite, in fact,\r\nmakes three revolutions in its orbit while the planet turns once upon\r\nits axis, and it therefore rises in the west and sets in the east, as\r\nseen from Mars, going from one horizon to the other in a little less\r\nthan 6 hours. The other satellite, Deimos, takes a few hours more than a\r\nday to make the circuit of its orbit, but the difference is so small\r\nthat it remains continuously above the horizon of any given place upon\r\nMars for more than 60 hours at a time, and during this period runs twice\r\nthrough its complete set of phases--new, first quarter, full, etc. In\r\nordinary telescopes these satellites can be seen only under especially\r\nfavorable circumstances, and are far too small to permit of any direct\r\nmeasurement of their size. The amount of light which they reflect has\r\nbeen compared with that of Mars and found to be as much inferior to it\r\nas is Polaris to two full moons, and, judging from this comparison,\r\ntheir diameters can not much exceed a half dozen miles, unless their\r\nalbedo is far less than that of Mars, which does not seem probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASTEROIDS\r\n\r\n156. MINOR PLANETS.--These may be dismissed with few words. There are\r\nabout 500 of them known, all discovered since the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, and new ones are still found every year. No one\r\npretends to remember the names which have been assigned them, and they\r\nare commonly represented by a number inclosed in a circle, showing the\r\norder in which they were discovered--e. g., [circle 1] = Ceres,\r\n[circle 433] = Eros, etc. For the most part they are little more than\r\nchips, world fragments, adrift in space, and naturally it was the larger\r\nand brighter of them that were first discovered. The size of the first\r\nfour of them--Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta--compared with the size of\r\nthe moon, according to Professor Barnard, is shown in Fig. 100. The\r\ngreat majority of them must be much smaller than the smallest of these,\r\nperhaps not more than a score of miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nA few of the asteroids present problems of special interest, such as\r\nEros, on account of its close approach to the earth; Polyhymnia, whose\r\nvery eccentric orbit makes it a valuable means for determining the mass\r\nof Jupiter, etc.; but these are special cases and the average asteroid\r\nnow receives scant attention, although half a century ago, when only a\r\nfew of them were known, they were regarded with much interest, and the\r\ndiscovery of a new one was an event of some consequence.\r\n\r\nIt was then a favorite speculation that they were in fact fragments of\r\nan ill-fated planet which once filled the gap between the orbits of Mars\r\nand Jupiter, but which, by some mischance, had been blown into pieces.\r\nThis is now known to be well-nigh impossible, for every fragment which\r\nafter the explosion moved in an elliptical orbit, as all the asteroids\r\ndo move, would be brought back once in every revolution to the place of\r\nthe explosion, and all the asteroid orbits must therefore intersect at\r\nthis place. But there is no such common point of intersection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--The size of the first four\r\nasteroids.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\n157. LIFE ON THE PLANETS.--There is a belief firmly grounded in the\r\npopular mind, and not without its advocates among professional\r\nastronomers, that the planets are inhabited by living and intelligent\r\nbeings, and it seems proper at the close of this chapter to inquire\r\nbriefly how far the facts and principles here developed are consistent\r\nwith this belief, and what support, if any, they lend to it.\r\n\r\nAt the outset we must observe that the word life is an elastic term,\r\nhard to define in any satisfactory way, and yet standing for something\r\nwhich we know here upon the earth. It is this idea, our familiar though\r\ncrude knowledge of life, which lies at the root of the matter. Life, if\r\nit exists in another planet, must be in its essential character like\r\nlife upon the earth, and must at least possess those features which are\r\ncommon to all forms of terrestrial life. It is an abuse of language to\r\nsay that life in Mars may be utterly unlike life in the earth; if it is\r\nabsolutely unlike, it is not life, whatever else it may be. Now, every\r\nform of life found upon the earth has for its physical basis a certain\r\nchemical compound, called protoplasm, which can exist and perpetuate\r\nitself only within a narrow range of temperature, roughly speaking,\r\nbetween 0° and 100° centigrade, although these limits can be\r\nconsiderably overstepped for short periods of time. Moreover, this\r\nprotoplasm can be active only in the presence of water, or water vapor,\r\nand we may therefore establish as the necessary conditions for the\r\ncontinued existence and reproduction of life in any place that its\r\ntemperature must not be permanently above 100° or below 0°, C., and\r\nwater must be present in that place in some form.\r\n\r\nWith these conditions before us it is plain that life can not exist in\r\nthe sun on account of its high temperature. It is conceivable that\r\nactive and intelligent beings, salamanders, might exist there, but they\r\ncould not properly be said to live. In Jupiter and Saturn the same\r\ncondition of high temperature prevails, and probably also in Uranus and\r\nNeptune, so that it seems highly improbable that any of these planets\r\nshould be the home of life.\r\n\r\nOf the inner planets, Mercury and the moon seem destitute of any\r\nconsiderable atmospheres, and are therefore lacking in the supply of\r\nwater necessary for life, and the same is almost certainly true of all\r\nthe asteroids. There remain Venus, Mars, and the satellites of the outer\r\nplanets, which latter, however, we must drop from consideration as being\r\ntoo little known. On Venus there is an atmosphere probably containing\r\nvapor of water, and it is well within the range of possibility that\r\nliquid water should exist upon the surface of this planet and that its\r\ntemperature should fall within the prescribed limits. It would, however,\r\nbe straining our actual knowledge to affirm that such is the case, or to\r\ninsist that if such were the case, life would necessarily exist upon the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nOn Mars we encounter the fundamental difficulty of temperature already\r\nnoted in § 152. If in some unknown way the temperature is maintained\r\nsufficiently high for the polar caps to be real snow, thawing and\r\nforming again with the progress of the seasons, the necessary conditions\r\nof life would seem to be fulfilled here and life if once introduced upon\r\nthe planet might abide and flourish. But of positive proof that such is\r\nthe case we have none.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, our survey lends little encouragement to the belief in\r\nplanetary life, for aside from the earth, of all the hundreds of bodies\r\nin the solar system, not one is found in which the necessary conditions\r\nof life are certainly fulfilled, and only two exist in which there is a\r\nreasonable probability that these conditions may be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCOMETS AND METEORS\r\n\r\n\r\n158. VISITORS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.--All of the objects--sun, moon,\r\nplanets, stars--which we have thus far had to consider, are permanent\r\ncitizens of the sky, and we have no reason to suppose that their present\r\nappearance differs appreciably from what it was 1,000 years or 10,000\r\nyears ago. But there is another class of objects--comets, meteors--which\r\nappear unexpectedly, are visible for a time, and then vanish and are\r\nseen no more. On account of this temporary character the astronomers of\r\nancient and mediæval times for the most part refused to regard them as\r\ncelestial bodies but classed them along with clouds, fogs,\r\nJack-o'-lanterns, and fireflies, as exhalations from the swamps or the\r\nvolcano; admitting them to be indeed important as harbingers of evil to\r\nmankind, but having no especial significance for the astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1618 A. D. inspired the lines--\r\n\r\n    \"Eight things there be a Comet brings,\r\n      When it on high doth horrid range:\r\n    Wind, Famine, Plague, and Death to Kings,\r\n      War, Earthquakes, Floods, and Direful Change,\"\r\n\r\nwhich, according to White (History of the Doctrine of Comets), were to\r\nbe taught in all seriousness to peasants and school children.\r\n\r\nIt was by slow degrees, and only after direct measurements of parallax\r\nhad shown some of them to be more distant than the moon, that the tide\r\nof old opinion was turned and comets were transferred from the sublunary\r\nto the celestial sphere, and in more recent times meteors also have\r\nbeen recognized as coming to us from outside the earth. A meteor, or\r\nshooting star as it is often called, is one of the commonest of\r\nphenomena, and one can hardly watch the sky for an hour on any clear and\r\nmoonless night without seeing several of those quick flashes of light\r\nwhich look as if some star had suddenly left its place, dashed swiftly\r\nacross a portion of the sky and then vanished. It is this misleading\r\nappearance that probably is responsible for the name shooting star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Donati's comet.--BOND.]\r\n\r\n159. COMETS.--Comets are less common and much longer-lived than meteors,\r\nlasting usually for several weeks, and may be visible night after night\r\nfor many months, but never for many years, at a time. During the last\r\ndecade there is no year in which less than three comets have appeared,\r\nand 1898 is distinguished by the discovery of ten of these bodies, the\r\nlargest number ever found in one year. On the average, we may expect a\r\nnew comet to be found about once in every ten weeks, but for the most\r\npart they are small affairs, visible only in the telescope, and a fine\r\nlarge one, like Donati's comet of 1858 (Fig. 101), or the Great Comet of\r\nSeptember, 1882, which was visible in broad daylight close beside the\r\nsun, is a rare spectacle, and as striking and impressive as it is rare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Some famous comets.]\r\n\r\nNote in Fig. 102 the great variety of aspect presented by some of the\r\nmore famous comets, which are here represented upon a very small scale.\r\n\r\nFig. 103 is from a photograph of one of the faint comets of the year\r\n1893, which appears here as a rather feeble streak of light amid the\r\nstars which are scattered over the background of the picture. An\r\napparently detached portion of this comet is shown at the extreme left\r\nof the picture, looking almost like another independent comet. The\r\nclean, straight line running diagonally across the picture is the flash\r\nof a bright meteor that chanced to pass within the range of the camera\r\nwhile the comet was being photographed.\r\n\r\nA more striking representation of a moderately bright telescopic comet\r\nis contained in Figs. 104 and 105, which present two different views of\r\nthe same comet, showing a considerable change in its appearance. A\r\nstriking feature of Fig. 105 is the star images, which are here drawn\r\nout into short lines all parallel with each other. During the exposure\r\nof 2h. 20m. required to imprint this picture upon the photographic\r\nplate, the comet was continually changing its position among the stars\r\non account of its orbital motion, and the plate was therefore moved\r\nfrom time to time, so as to follow the comet and make its image always\r\nfall at the same place. Hence the plate was continually shifted relative\r\nto the stars whose images, drawn out into lines, show the direction in\r\nwhich the plate was moved--i. e., the direction in which the comet was\r\nmoving across the sky. The same effect is shown in the other\r\nphotographs, but less conspicuously than here on account of their\r\nshorter exposure times.\r\n\r\nThese pictures all show that one end of the comet is brighter and\r\napparently more dense than the other, and it is customary to call this\r\nbright part the _head_ of the comet, while the brushlike appendage that\r\nstreams away from it is called the comet's _tail_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Brooks's comet, November 13, 1893. BARNARD.]\r\n\r\n160. THE PARTS OF A COMET.--It is not every comet that has a tail,\r\nthough all the large ones do, and in Fig. 103 the detached piece of\r\ncometary matter at the left of the picture represents very well the\r\nappearance of a tailless comet, a rather large but not very bright star\r\nof a fuzzy or hairy appearance. The word comet means long-haired or\r\nhairy star. Something of this vagueness of outline is found in all\r\ncomets, whose exact boundaries are hard to define, instead of being\r\nsharp and clean-cut like those of a planet or satellite. Often,\r\nhowever, there is found in the head of a comet a much more solid\r\nappearing part, like the round white ball at the center of Fig. 106,\r\nwhich is called the nucleus of the comet, and appears to be in some sort\r\nthe center from which its activities radiate. As shown in Figs. 106 and\r\n107, the nucleus is sometimes surrounded by what are called envelopes,\r\nwhich have the appearance of successive wrappings or halos placed about\r\nit, and odd, spurlike projections, called jets, are sometimes found in\r\nconnection with the envelopes or in place of them. These figures also\r\nshow what is quite a common characteristic of large comets, a dark\r\nstreak running down the axis of the tail, showing that the tail is\r\nhollow, a mere shell surrounding empty space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Swift's comet, April 17, 1892.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of detail shown in Figs. 106 and 107 is, however, quite\r\nexceptional, and the ordinary comet is much more like Fig. 103 or 104.\r\nEven a great comet when it first appears is not unlike the detached\r\nfragment in Fig. 103, a faint and roundish patch of foggy light which\r\ngrows through successive stages to its maximum estate, developing a\r\ntail, nucleus, envelopes, etc., only to lose them again as it shrinks\r\nand finally disappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Swift's comet, April 24, 1892.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\n161. THE ORBITS OF COMETS.--It will be remembered that Newton found, as\r\na theoretical consequence of the law of gravitation, that a body moving\r\nunder the influence of the sun's attraction might have as its orbit any\r\none of the conic sections, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola, and among\r\nthe 400 and more comet orbits which have been determined every one of\r\nthese orbit forms appears, but curiously enough there is not a hyperbola\r\namong them which, if drawn upon paper, could be distinguished by the\r\nunaided eye from a parabola, and the ellipses are all so long and\r\nnarrow, not one of them being so nearly round as is the most eccentric\r\nplanet orbit, that astronomers are accustomed to look upon the parabola\r\nas being the normal type of comet orbit, and to regard a comet whose\r\nmotion differs much from a parabola as being abnormal and calling for\r\nsome special explanation.\r\n\r\nThe fact that comet orbits are parabolas, or differ but little from\r\nthem, explains at once the temporary character and speedy disappearance\r\nof these bodies. They are visitors to the solar system and visible for\r\nonly a short time, because the parabola in which they travel is not a\r\nclosed curve, and the comet, having passed once along that portion of it\r\nnear the earth and the sun, moves off along a path which ever thereafter\r\ntakes it farther and farther away, beyond the limit of visibility. The\r\ndevelopment of the comet during the time it is visible, the growth and\r\ndisappearance of tail, nucleus, etc., depend upon its changing distance\r\nfrom the sun, the highest development and most complex structure being\r\npresented when it is nearest to the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Head of Coggia's comet, July 13,\r\n1874.--TROUVELOT.]\r\n\r\nFig. 108 shows the path of the Great Comet of 1882 during the period\r\nin which it was seen, from September 3, 1882, to May 26, 1883. These\r\ndates--IX, 3, and V, 26--are marked in the figure opposite the parts\r\nof the orbit in which the comet stood at those times. Similarly, the\r\npositions of the earth in its orbit at the beginning of September,\r\nOctober, November, etc., are marked by the Roman numerals IX, X, XI,\r\netc. The line _S V_ shows the direction from the sun to the vernal\r\nequinox, and _S_ [Ô] is the line along which the plane of the comet's\r\norbit intersects the plane of the earth's orbit--i. e., it is the line\r\nof nodes of the comet orbit. Since the comet approached the sun from the\r\nsouth side of the ecliptic, all of its orbit, save the little segment\r\nwhich falls to the left of _S_ [Ô], lies below (south) of the plane of\r\nthe earth's orbit, and the part which would be hidden if this plane were\r\nopaque is represented by a broken line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Head of Donati's comet, September 30, October\r\n2, 1858.--BOND.]\r\n\r\n162. ELEMENTS OF A COMET'S ORBIT.--There is a theorem of geometry to the\r\neffect that through any three points not in the same straight line one\r\ncircle, and only one, can be drawn. Corresponding to this there is a\r\ntheorem of celestial mechanics, that through any three positions of a\r\ncomet one conic section, and only one, can be passed along which the\r\ncomet can move in accordance with the law of gravitation. This conic\r\nsection is, of course, its orbit, and at the discovery of a comet\r\nastronomers always hasten to observe its position in the sky on\r\ndifferent nights in order to obtain the three positions (right\r\nascensions and declinations) necessary for determining the particular\r\norbit in which it moves. The circle, to which reference was made above,\r\nis completely ascertained and defined when we know its radius and the\r\nposition of its center. A parabola is not so simply defined, and five\r\nnumbers, called the _elements_ of its orbit, are required to fix\r\naccurately a comet's path around the sun. Two of these relate to the\r\nposition of the line of nodes and the angle which the orbit plane makes\r\nwith the plane of the ecliptic; a third fixes the direction of the axis\r\nof the orbit in its plane, and the remaining two, which are of more\r\ninterest to us, are the date at which the comet makes its nearest\r\napproach to the sun (_perihelion passage_) and its distance from the sun\r\nat that date (_perihelion distance_). The date, September 17th, placed\r\nnear the center of Fig. 108, is the former of these elements, while the\r\nlatter, which is too small to be accurately measured here, may be found\r\nfrom Fig. 109 to be 0.82 of the sun's diameter, or, in terms of the\r\nearth's distance from the sun, 0.008.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Orbits of the earth and the Great Comet of\r\n1882.]\r\n\r\nFig. 109 shows on a large scale the shape of that part of the orbit near\r\nthe sun and gives the successive positions of the comet, at intervals of\r\n2/10 of a day, on September 16th and 17th, showing that in less than 10\r\nhours--17.0 to 17.4--the comet swung around the sun through an angle of\r\nmore than 240°. When at its perihelion it was moving with a velocity of\r\n300 miles per second! This very unusual velocity was due to the comet's\r\nextraordinarily close approach to the sun. The earth's velocity in its\r\norbit is only 19 miles per second, and the velocity of any comet at any\r\ndistance from the sun, provided its orbit is a parabola, may be found by\r\ndividing this number by the square root of half the comet's\r\ndistance--e. g., 300 miles per second equals 19 ÷ 0.004^{1/2}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Motion of the Great Comet of 1883 in passing\r\naround the sun.]\r\n\r\nMost of the visible comets have their perihelion distances included\r\nbetween 1/3 and 4/3 of the earth's distance from the sun, but\r\noccasionally one is found, like the second comet of 1885, whose nearest\r\napproach to the sun lies far outside the earth's orbit, in this case\r\nhalfway out to the orbit of Jupiter; but such a comet must be a very\r\nlarge one in order to be seen at all from the earth. There is, however,\r\nsome reason for believing that the number of comets which move around\r\nthe sun without ever coming inside the orbit of Jupiter, or even that of\r\nSaturn, is much larger than the number of those which come close enough\r\nto be discovered from the earth. In any case we are reminded of Kepler's\r\nsaying, that comets in the sky are as plentiful as fishes in the sea,\r\nwhich seems to be very little exaggerated when we consider that,\r\naccording to Kleiber, out of all the comets which enter the solar system\r\nprobably not more than 2 or 3 per cent are ever discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--The Great Comet of 1843.]\r\n\r\n163. DIMENSIONS OF COMETS.--The comet whose orbit is shown in Figs. 108\r\nand 109 is the finest and largest that has appeared in recent years. Its\r\ntail, which at its maximum extent would have more than bridged the space\r\nbetween sun and earth (100,000,000 miles), is made very much too short\r\nin Fig. 109, but when at its best was probably not inferior to that of\r\nthe Great Comet of 1843, shown in Fig. 110. As we shall see later,\r\nthere is a peculiar and special relationship between these two comets.\r\n\r\nThe head of the comet of 1882 was not especially large--about twice the\r\ndiameter of the ball of Saturn--but its nucleus, according to an\r\nestimate made by Dr. Elkin when it was very near perihelion, was as\r\nlarge as the moon. The head of the comet shown in Fig. 107 was too large\r\nto be put in the space between the earth and the moon, and the Great\r\nComet of 1811 had a head considerably larger than the sun itself. From\r\nthese colossal sizes down to the smallest shred just visible in the\r\ntelescope, comets of all dimensions may be found, but the smaller the\r\ncomet the less the chance of its being discovered, and a comet as small\r\nas the earth would probably go unobserved unless it approached very\r\nclose to us.\r\n\r\n164. THE MASS OF A COMET.--There is no known case in which the mass of a\r\ncomet has ever been measured, yet nothing about them is more sure than\r\nthat they are bodies with mass which is attracted by the sun and the\r\nplanets, and which in its turn attracts both sun and planets and\r\nproduces perturbations in their motion. These perturbations are,\r\nhowever, too small to be measured, although the corresponding\r\nperturbations in the comet's motion are sometimes enormous, and since\r\nthese mutual perturbations are proportional to the masses of comet and\r\nplanet, we are forced to say that, by comparison with even such small\r\nbodies as the moon or Mercury, the mass of a comet is utterly\r\ninsignificant, certainly not as great as a ten-thousandth part of the\r\nmass of the earth. In the case of the Great Comet of 1882, if we leave\r\nits hundred million miles of tail out of account and suppose the entire\r\nmass condensed into its head, we find by a little computation that the\r\naverage density of the head under these circumstances must have been\r\nless than 1/1500 of the density of air. In ordinary laboratory practice\r\nthis would be called a pretty good vacuum. A striking observation made\r\non September 17, 1882, goes to confirm the very small density of this\r\ncomet. It is shown in Fig. 109 that early on that day the comet crossed\r\nthe line joining earth and sun, and therefore passed in transit over the\r\nsun's disk. Two observers at the Cape of Good Hope saw the comet\r\napproach the sun, and followed it with their telescopes until the\r\nnucleus actually reached the edge of the sun and disappeared, behind it\r\nas they supposed, for no trace of the comet, not even its nucleus, could\r\nbe seen against the sun, although it was carefully looked for. Now, the\r\nfigure shows that the comet passed between the earth and sun, and its\r\ndensest parts were therefore too attenuated to cut off any perceptible\r\nfraction of the sun's rays. In other cases stars have been seen through\r\nthe head of a comet, shining apparently with undimmed luster, although\r\nin some cases they seem to have been slightly refracted out of their\r\ntrue positions.\r\n\r\n165. METEORS.--Before proceeding further with the study of comets it is\r\nwell to turn aside and consider their humbler relatives, the shooting\r\nstars. On some clear evening, when the moon is absent from the sky,\r\nwatch the heavens for an hour and count the meteors visible during that\r\ntime. Note their paths, the part of the sky where they appear and where\r\nthey disappear, their brightness, and whether they all move with equal\r\nswiftness. Out of such simple observations with the unaided eye there\r\nhas grown a large and important branch of astronomical science, some\r\nparts of which we shall briefly summarize here.\r\n\r\nA particular meteor is a local phenomenon seen over only a small part of\r\nthe earth's surface, although occasionally a very big and bright one may\r\ntravel and be visible over a considerable territory. Such a one in\r\nDecember, 1876, swept over the United States from Kansas to\r\nPennsylvania, and was seen from eleven different States. But the\r\nordinary shooting star is much less conspicuous, and, as we know from\r\nsimultaneous observations made at neighboring places, it makes its\r\nappearance at a height of some 75 miles above the earth's surface,\r\noccupies something like a second in moving over its path, and then\r\ndisappears at a height of about 50 miles or more, although occasionally\r\na big one comes down to the very surface of the earth with force\r\nsufficient to bury itself in the ground, from which it may be dug up,\r\nhandled, weighed, and turned over to the chemist to be analyzed. The\r\npieces thus found show that the big meteors, at least, are masses of\r\nstone or mineral; iron is quite commonly found in them, as are a\r\nconsiderable number of other terrestrial substances combined in rather\r\npeculiar ways. But no chemical element not found on the earth has ever\r\nbeen discovered in a meteor.\r\n\r\n166. NATURE OF METEORS.--The swiftness with which the meteors sweep down\r\nshows that they must come from outside the earth, for even half their\r\nvelocity, if given to them by some terrestrial volcano or other\r\nexplosive agent, would send them completely away from the earth never to\r\nreturn. We must therefore look upon them as so many projectiles,\r\nbullets, fired against the earth from some outside source and arrested\r\nin their motion by the earth's atmosphere, which serves as a cushion to\r\nprotect the ground from the bombardment which would otherwise prove in\r\nthe highest degree dangerous to both property and life. The speed of the\r\nmeteor is checked by the resistance which the atmosphere offers to its\r\nmotion, and the energy represented by that speed is transformed into\r\nheat, which in less than a second raises the meteor and the surrounding\r\nair to incandescence, melts the meteor either wholly or in part, and\r\nusually destroys its identity, leaving only an impalpable dust, which\r\ncools off as it settles slowly through the lower atmosphere to the\r\nground. The heating effect of the air's resistance is proportional to\r\nthe square of the meteor's velocity, and even at such a moderate speed\r\nas 1 mile per second the effect upon the meteor is the same as if it\r\nstood still in a bath of red-hot air. Now, the actual velocity of\r\nmeteors through the air is often 30 or 40 times as great as this, and\r\nthe corresponding effect of the air in raising its temperature is more\r\nthan 1,000 times that of red heat. Small wonder that the meteor is\r\nbrought to lively incandescence and consumed even in a fraction of a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n167. THE NUMBER OF METEORS.--A single observer may expect to see in the\r\nevening hours about one meteor every 10 minutes on the average,\r\nalthough, of course, in this respect much irregularity may occur. Later\r\nin the night they become more frequent, and after 2 A. M. there are\r\nabout three times as many to be seen as in the evening hours. But no one\r\nperson can keep a watch upon the whole sky, high and low, in front and\r\nbehind, and experience shows that by increasing the number of observers\r\nand assigning to each a particular part of the sky, the total number of\r\nmeteors counted may be increased about five-fold. So, too, the observers\r\nat any one place can keep an effective watch upon only those meteors\r\nwhich come into the earth's atmosphere within some moderate distance of\r\ntheir station, say 50 or 100 miles, and to watch every part of that\r\natmosphere would require a large number of stations, estimated at\r\nsomething more than 10,000, scattered systematically over the whole face\r\nof the earth. If we piece together the several numbers above considered,\r\ntaking 14 as a fair average of the hourly number of meteors to be seen\r\nby a single observer at all hours of the night, we shall find for\r\nthe total number of meteors encountered by the earth in 24 hours,\r\n14 × 5 × 10,000 × 24 = 16,800,000. Without laying too much stress upon\r\nthis particular number, we may fairly say that the meteors picked up by\r\nthe earth every day are to be reckoned by millions, and since they come\r\nat all seasons of the year, we shall have to admit that the region\r\nthrough which the earth moves, instead of being empty space, is really a\r\ndust cloud, each individual particle of dust being a prospective meteor.\r\n\r\nOn the average these individual particles are very small and very far\r\napart; a cloud of silver dimes each about 250 miles from its nearest\r\nneighbor is perhaps a fair representation of their average mass and\r\ndistance from each other, but, of course, great variations are to be\r\nexpected both in the size and in the frequency of the particles. There\r\nmust be great numbers of them that are too small to make shooting stars\r\nvisible to the naked eye, and such are occasionally seen darting by\r\nchance across the field of view of a telescope.\r\n\r\n168. THE ZODIACAL LIGHT is an effect probably due to the reflection of\r\nsunlight from the myriads of these tiny meteors which occupy the space\r\ninside the earth's orbit. It is a faint and diffuse stream of light,\r\nsomething like the Milky Way, which may be seen in the early evening or\r\nmorning stretching up from the sunrise or sunset point of the horizon\r\nalong the ecliptic and following its course for many degrees, possibly\r\naround the entire circumference of the sky. It may be seen at any season\r\nof the year, although it shows to the best advantage in spring evenings\r\nand autumn mornings. Look for it.\r\n\r\n169. GREAT METEORS.--But there are other meteors, veritable fireballs in\r\nappearance, far more conspicuous and imposing than the ordinary shooting\r\nstar. Such a one exploded over the city of Madrid, Spain, on the morning\r\nof February 10, 1896, giving in broad sunlight \"a brilliant flash which\r\nwas followed ninety seconds later by a succession of terrific noises\r\nlike the discharge of a battery of artillery.\" Fig. 111 shows a large\r\nmeteor which was seen in California in the early evening of July 27,\r\n1894, and which left behind it a luminous trail or cloud visible for\r\nmore than half an hour.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently large meteors are found traveling together, two or\r\nthree or more in company, making their appearance simultaneously as did\r\nthe California meteor of October 22, 1896, which is described as triple,\r\nthe trio following one another like a train of cars, and Arago cites an\r\ninstance, from the year 1830, where within a short space of time some\r\nforty brilliant meteors crossed the sky, all moving in the same\r\ndirection with a whistling noise and displaying in their flight all the\r\ncolors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe mass of great meteors such as these must be measured in hundreds if\r\nnot thousands of pounds, and stories are current, although not very well\r\nauthenticated, of even larger ones, many tons in weight, having been\r\nfound partially buried in the ground. Of meteors which have been\r\nactually seen to fall from the sky, the largest single fragment\r\nrecovered weighs about 500 pounds, but it is only a fragment of the\r\noriginal meteor, which must have been much more massive before it was\r\nbroken up by collision with the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--The California meteor of July 27, 1894.]\r\n\r\n170. THE VELOCITY OF METEORS.--Every meteor, big or little, is subject\r\nto the law of gravitation, and before it encounters the earth must be\r\nmoving in some kind of orbit having the sun at its focus, the particular\r\nspecies of orbit--ellipse, parabola, hyperbola--depending upon the\r\nvelocity and direction of its motion. Now, the direction in which a\r\nmeteor is moving can be determined without serious difficulty from\r\nobservations of its apparent path across the sky made by two or more\r\nobservers, but the velocity can not be so readily found, since the\r\nmeteors go too fast for any ordinary process of timing. But by\r\nphotographing one of them two or three times on the same plate, with an\r\ninterval of only a tenth of a second between exposures, Dr. Elkin has\r\nsucceeded in showing, in a few cases, that their velocities varied from\r\n20 to 25 miles per second, and must have been considerably greater than\r\nthis before the meteors encountered the earth's atmosphere. This is a\r\ngreater velocity than that of the earth in its orbit, 19 miles per\r\nsecond, as might have been anticipated, since the mere fact that meteors\r\ncan be seen at all in the evening hours shows that some of them at least\r\nmust travel considerably faster than the earth, for, counting in the\r\ndirection of the earth's motion, the region of sunset and evening is\r\nalways on the rear side of the earth, and meteors in order to strike\r\nthis region must overtake it by their swifter motion. We have here, in\r\nfact, the reason why meteors are especially abundant in the morning\r\nhours; at this time the observer is on the front side of the earth which\r\ncatches swift and slow meteors alike, while the rear is pelted only by\r\nthe swifter ones which follow it.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the relative number of morning and evening meteors makes\r\nit probable that the average meteor moves, relative to the sun, with a\r\nvelocity of about 26 miles per second, which is very approximately the\r\naverage velocity of comets when they are at the earth's distance from\r\nthe sun. Astronomers, therefore, consider meteors as well as comets to\r\nhave the parabola and the elongated ellipse as their characteristic\r\norbits.\r\n\r\n171. METEOR SHOWERS--THE RADIANT.--There is evident among meteors a\r\ndistinct tendency for individuals, to the number of hundreds or even\r\nhundreds of millions, to travel together in flocks or swarms, all going\r\nthe same way in orbits almost exactly alike. This gregarious tendency is\r\nmade manifest not only by the fact that from time to time there are\r\nunusually abundant meteoric displays, but also by a striking peculiarity\r\nof their behavior at such times. The meteors all seem to come from a\r\nparticular part of the heavens, as if here were a hole in the sky\r\nthrough which they were introduced, and from which they flow away in\r\nevery direction, even those which do not visibly start from this place\r\nhaving paths among the stars which, if prolonged backward, would pass\r\nthrough it. The cause of this appearance may be understood from Fig.\r\n112, which represents a group of meteors moving together along parallel\r\npaths toward an observer at _D_. Traveling unseen above the earth until\r\nthey encounter the upper strata of its atmosphere, they here become\r\nincandescent and speed on in parallel paths, _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, _5_,\r\n_6_, which, as seen by the observer, are projected back against the sky\r\ninto luminous streaks that, as is shown by the arrowheads, _b_, _c_,\r\n_d_, all seem to radiate from the point _a_--i. e., from the point in\r\nthe sky whose direction from the observer is parallel to the paths of\r\nthe meteors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Explanation of the radiant of a meteoric\r\nshower.--DENNING.]\r\n\r\nSuch a display is called a meteor shower, and the point _a_ is called\r\nits radiant. Note how those meteors which appear near the radiant all\r\nhave short paths, while those remote from it in the sky have longer\r\nones. Query: As the night wears on and the stars shift toward the west,\r\nwill the radiant share in their motion or will it be left behind? Would\r\nthe luminous part of the path of any of these meteors pass across the\r\nradiant from one side to the other? Is such a crossing of the radiant\r\npossible under any circumstances? Fig. 113 shows how the meteor paths\r\nare grouped around the radiant of a strongly marked shower. Select from\r\nit the meteors which do not belong to this shower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--The radiant of a meteoric shower, showing\r\nalso the paths of three meteors which do not belong to this\r\nshower.--DENNING.]\r\n\r\nMany hundreds of these radiants have been observed in the sky, each of\r\nwhich represents an orbit along which a group of meteors moves, and the\r\nrelation of one of these orbits to that of the earth is shown in Fig.\r\n114. The orbit of the meteors is an ellipse extending out beyond the\r\norbit of Uranus, but so eccentric that a part of it comes inside the\r\norbit of the earth, and the figure shows only that part of it which lies\r\nnearest the sun. The Roman numerals which are placed along the earth's\r\norbit show the position of the earth at the beginning of the tenth\r\nmonth, eleventh month, etc. The meteors flow along their orbit in a long\r\nprocession, whose direction of motion is indicated by the arrow heads,\r\nand the earth, coming in the opposite direction, plunges into this\r\nstream and receives the meteor shower when it reaches the intersection\r\nof the two orbits. The long arrow at the left of the figure represents\r\nthe direction of motion of another meteor shower which encounters the\r\nearth at this point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--The orbits of the earth and the November\r\nmeteors.]\r\n\r\nCan you determine from the figure answers to the following questions? On\r\nwhat day of the year will the earth meet each of these showers? Will the\r\nradiant points of the showers lie above or below the plane of the\r\nearth's orbit? Will these meteors strike the front or the rear of the\r\nearth? Can they be seen in the evening hours?\r\n\r\nFrom many of the radiants year after year, upon the same day or week in\r\neach year, there comes a swarm of shooting stars, showing that there\r\nmust be a continuous procession of meteors moving along this orbit, so\r\nthat some are always ready to strike the earth whenever it reaches the\r\nintersection of its orbit with theirs. Such is the explanation of the\r\nshower which appears each year in the first half of August, and whose\r\nmeteors are sometimes called Perseids, because their radiant lies in the\r\nconstellation Perseus, and a similar explanation holds for all the star\r\nshowers which are repeated year after year.\r\n\r\n172. THE LEONIDS.--There is, however, a kind of star shower, of which\r\nthe Leonids (radiant in Leo) is the most conspicuous type, in which the\r\nshower, although repeated from year to year, is much more striking in\r\nsome years than in others. Thus, to quote from the historian: \"In 1833\r\nthe shower was well observed along the whole eastern coast of North\r\nAmerica from the Gulf of Mexico to Halifax. The meteors were most\r\nnumerous at about 5 A. M. on November 13th, and the rising sun could not\r\nblot out all traces of the phenomena, for large meteors were seen now\r\nand then in full daylight. Within the scope that the eye could contain,\r\nmore than twenty could be seen at a time shooting in every direction.\r\nNot a cloud obscured the broad expanse, and millions of meteors sped\r\ntheir way across in every point of the compass. Their coruscations were\r\nbright, gleaming, and incessant, and they fell thick as the flakes in\r\nthe early snows of December.\" But, so far as is known, none of them\r\nreached the ground. An illiterate man on the following day remarked:\r\n\"The stars continued to fall until none were left. I am anxious to see\r\nhow the heavens will appear this evening, for I believe we shall see no\r\nmore stars.\"\r\n\r\nAn eyewitness in the Southern States thus describes the effect of this\r\nshower upon the plantation negroes: \"Upward of a hundred lay prostrate\r\nupon the ground, some speechless and some with the bitterest cries, but\r\nwith their hands upraised, imploring God to save the world and them. The\r\nscene was truly awful, for never did rain fall much thicker than the\r\nmeteors fell toward the earth--east, west, north, and south it was the\r\nsame.\" In the preceding year a similar but feebler shower from the same\r\nradiant created much alarm in France, and through the old historic\r\nrecords its repetitions may be traced back at intervals of 33 or 34\r\nyears, although with many interruptions, to October 12, 902, O. S., when\r\n\"an immense number of falling stars were seen to spread themselves over\r\nthe face of the sky like rain.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a star shower differs from the one repeated every year chiefly in\r\nthe fact that its meteors, instead of being drawn out into a long\r\nprocession, are mainly clustered in a single flock which may be long\r\nenough to require two or three or four years to pass a given point of\r\nits orbit, but which is far from extending entirely around it, so that\r\nmeteors from this source are abundant only in those years in which the\r\nflock is at or near the intersection of its orbit with that of the\r\nearth. The fact that the Leonid shower is repeated at intervals of 33 or\r\n34 years (it appeared in 1799, 1832-'33, 1866-'67) shows that this is\r\nthe \"periodic time\" in its orbit, which latter must of course be an\r\nellipse, and presumably a long and narrow one. It is this orbit which is\r\nshown in Fig. 114, and the student should note in this figure that if\r\nthe meteor stream at the point where it cuts through the plane of the\r\nearth's orbit were either nearer to or farther from the sun than is the\r\nearth there could be no shower; the earth and the meteors would pass by\r\nwithout a collision. Now, the meteors in their motion are subject to\r\nperturbations, particularly by the large planets Jupiter, Saturn, and\r\nUranus, which slightly change the meteor orbit, and it seems certain\r\nthat the changes thus produced will sometimes thrust the swarm inside or\r\noutside the orbit of the earth, and thus cause a failure of the shower\r\nat times when it is expected. The meteors were due at the crossing of\r\nthe orbits in November, 1899 and 1900, and, although a few were then\r\nseen, the shower was far from being a brilliant one, and its failure was\r\ndoubtless caused by the outer planets, which switched the meteors aside\r\nfrom the path in which they had been moving for a century. Whether they\r\nwill be again switched back so as to produce future showers is at the\r\npresent time uncertain.\r\n\r\n173. CAPTURE OF THE LEONIDS.--But a far more striking effect of\r\nperturbations is to be found in Fig. 115, which shows the relation of\r\nthe Leonid orbit to those of the principal planets, and illustrates a\r\ncurious chapter in the history of the meteor swarm that has been worked\r\nout by mathematical analysis, and is probably a pretty good account of\r\nwhat actually befell them. Early in the second century of the Christian\r\nera this flock of meteors came down toward the sun from outer space,\r\nmoving along a parabolic orbit which would have carried it just inside\r\nthe orbit of Jupiter, and then have sent it off to return no more. But\r\nsuch was not to be its fate. As it approached the orbit of Uranus, in\r\nthe year 126 A. D., that planet chanced to be very near at hand and\r\nperturbed the motion of the meteors to such an extent that the character\r\nof their orbit was completely changed into the ellipse shown in the\r\nfigure, and in this new orbit they have moved from that time to this,\r\npermanent instead of transient members of the solar system. The\r\nperturbations, however, did not end with the year in which the meteors\r\nwere captured and annexed to the solar system, but ever since that time\r\nJupiter, Saturn, and Uranus have been pulling together upon the orbit,\r\nand have gradually turned it around into its present position as shown\r\nin the figure, and it is chiefly this shifting of the orbit's position\r\nin the thousand years that have elapsed since 902 A. D. that makes the\r\nmeteor shower now come in November instead of in October as it did\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Supposed capture of the November meteors by\r\nUranus.]\r\n\r\n174. BREAKING UP A METEOR SWARM.--How closely packed together these\r\nmeteors were at the time of their annexation to the solar system is\r\nunknown, but it is certain that ever since that time the sun has been\r\nexerting upon them a tidal influence tending to break up the swarm and\r\ndistribute its particles around the orbit, as the Perseids are\r\ndistributed, and, given sufficient time, it will accomplish this, but up\r\nto the present the work is only partly done. A certain number of the\r\nmeteors have gained so much over the slower moving ones as to have made\r\nan extra circuit of the orbit and overtaken the rear of the procession,\r\nso that there is a thin stream of them extending entirely around the\r\norbit and furnishing in every November a Leonid shower; but by far the\r\nlarger part of the meteors still cling together, although drawn out into\r\na stream or ribbon, which, though very thin, is so long that it takes\r\nsome three years to pass through the perihelion of its orbit. It is only\r\nwhen the earth plunges through this ribbon, as it should in 1899, 1900,\r\n1901, that brilliant Leonid showers can be expected.\r\n\r\n175. RELATION OF COMETS AND METEORS.--It appears from the foregoing that\r\nmeteors and comets move in similar orbits, and we have now to push the\r\nanalogy a little further and note that in some instances at least they\r\nmove in identically the same orbit, or at least in orbits so like that\r\nan appreciable difference between them is hardly to be found. Thus a\r\ncomet which was discovered and observed early in the year 1866, moves in\r\nthe same orbit with the Leonid meteors, passing its perihelion about ten\r\nmonths ahead of the main body of the meteors. If it were set back in its\r\norbit by ten months' motion, _it would be a part of the meteor swarm_.\r\nSimilarly, the Perseid meteors have a comet moving in their orbit\r\nactually immersed in the stream of meteor particles, and several other\r\nof the more conspicuous star showers have comets attending them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable case of this character is that of a shower\r\nwhich comes in the latter part of November from the constellation\r\nAndromeda, and which from its association with the comet called Biela\r\n(after the name of its discoverer) is frequently referred to as the\r\nBielid shower. This comet, an inconspicuous one moving in an unusually\r\nsmall elliptical orbit, had been observed at various times from 1772\r\ndown to 1846 without presenting anything remarkable in its appearance;\r\nbut about the beginning of the latter year, with very little warning, it\r\nbroke in two, and for three months the pieces were watched by\r\nastronomers moving off, side by side, something more than half as far\r\napart as are the earth and moon. It disappeared, made the circuit of its\r\norbit, and six years later came back, with the fragments nearly ten\r\ntimes as far apart as before, and after a short stay near the earth once\r\nmore disappeared in the distance, never to be seen again, although the\r\nfragments should have returned to perihelion at least half a dozen times\r\nsince then. In one respect the orbit of the comet was remarkable: it\r\npassed through the place in which the earth stands on November 27th of\r\neach year, so that if the comet were at that particular part of its\r\norbit on any November 27th, a collision between it and the earth would\r\nbe inevitable. So far as is known, no such collision with the comet has\r\never occurred, but the Bielid meteors which are strung along its orbit\r\ndo encounter the earth on that date, in greater or less abundance in\r\ndifferent years, and are watched with much interest by the astronomers\r\nwho look upon them as the final appearance of the _débris_ of a worn-out\r\ncomet.\r\n\r\n176. PERIODIC COMETS.--The Biela comet is a specimen of the type which\r\nastronomers call periodic comets--i. e., those which move in small\r\nellipses and have correspondingly short periodic times, so that they\r\nreturn frequently and regularly to perihelion. The comets which\r\naccompany the other meteor swarms--Leonids, Perseids, etc.--also belong\r\nto this class as do some 30 or 40 others which have periodic times less\r\nthan a century. As has been already indicated, these deviations from the\r\nnormal parabolic orbit call for some special explanation, and the\r\nsubstance of that explanation is contained in the account of the Leonid\r\nmeteors and their capture by Uranus. Any comet may be thus captured by\r\nthe attraction of a planet near which it passes. It is only necessary\r\nthat the perturbing action of the planet should result in a diminution\r\nof the comet's velocity, for we have already learned that it is this\r\nvelocity which determines the character of the orbit, and anything less\r\nthan the velocity appropriate to a parabola must produce an\r\nellipse--i. e., a closed orbit around which the body will revolve time\r\nafter time in endless succession. We note in Fig. 115 that when the\r\nLeonid swarm encountered Uranus it passed _in front of_ the planet and\r\nhad its velocity diminished and its orbit changed into an ellipse\r\nthereby. It might have passed behind Uranus, it would have passed behind\r\nhad it come a little later, and the effect would then have been just the\r\nopposite. Its velocity would have been increased, its orbit changed to a\r\nhyperbola, and it would have left the solar system more rapidly than it\r\ncame into it, thrust out instead of held in by the disturbing planet. Of\r\nsuch cases we can expect no record to remain, but the captured comet is\r\nits own witness to what has happened, and bears imprinted upon its orbit\r\nthe brand of the planet which slowed down its motion. Thus in Fig. 115\r\nthe changed orbit of the meteors has its _aphelion_ (part remotest from\r\nthe sun) quite close to the orbit of Uranus, and one of its nodes,\r\n[mho], the point in which it cuts through the plane of the ecliptic from\r\nnorth to south side, is also very near to the same orbit. It is these\r\ntwo marks, aphelion and node, which by their position identify Uranus as\r\nthe planet instrumental in capturing the meteor swarm, and the date of\r\nthe capture is found by working back with their respective periodic\r\ntimes to an epoch at which planet and comet were simultaneously near\r\nthis node.\r\n\r\nJupiter, by reason of his great mass, is an especially efficient\r\ncapturer of comets, and Fig. 116 shows his group of captives, his\r\nfamily of comets as they are sometimes called. The several orbits are\r\nmarked with the names commonly given to the comets. Frequently this is\r\nthe name of their discoverer, but often a different system is\r\nfollowed--e. g., the name 1886, IV, means the fourth comet to pass\r\nthrough perihelion in the year 1886. The other great planets--Saturn,\r\nUranus, Neptune--have also their families of captured comets, and\r\naccording to Schulhof, who does not entirely agree with the common\r\nopinion about captured comets, the earth has caught no less than nine of\r\nthese bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Jupiter's family of comets.]\r\n\r\n177. COMET GROUPS.--But there is another kind of comet family, or comet\r\ngroup as it is called, which deserves some notice, and which is best\r\nexemplified by the Great Comet of 1882 and its relatives. No less than\r\nfour other comets are known to be traveling in substantially the same\r\norbit with this one, the group consisting of comets 1668, I; 1843, I;\r\n1880, I; 1882, II; 1887, I. The orbit itself is not quite a parabola,\r\nbut a very elongated ellipse, whose major axis and corresponding\r\nperiodic time can not be very accurately determined from the available\r\ndata, but it certainly extends far beyond the orbit of Neptune, and\r\nrequires not less than 500 years for the comet to complete a revolution\r\nin it. It was for a time supposed that some one of the recent comets of\r\nthis group of five might be a return of the comet of 1668 brought back\r\nahead of time by unknown perturbations. There is still a possibility of\r\nthis, but it is quite out of the question to suppose that the last four\r\nmembers of the group are anything other than separate and distinct\r\ncomets moving in practically the same orbit. This common orbit suggests\r\na common origin for the comets, but leaves us to conjecture how they\r\nbecame separated.\r\n\r\nThe observed orbits of these five comets present some slight\r\ndiscordances among themselves, but if we suppose each comet to move in\r\nthe average of the observed paths it is a simple matter to fix their\r\nseveral positions at the present time. They have all receded from the\r\nsun nearly on line toward the bright star Sirius, and were all of them,\r\nat the beginning of the year 1900, standing nearly motionless inside of\r\na space not bigger than the sun and distant from the sun about 150 radii\r\nof the earth's orbit. The great rapidity with which they swept through\r\nthat part of their orbit near the sun (see § 162) is being compensated\r\nby the present extreme slowness of their motions, so that the comets of\r\n1668 and 1882, whose passages through the solar system were separated by\r\nan interval of more than two centuries, now stand together near the\r\naphelion of their orbits, separated by a distance only 50 per cent\r\ngreater than the diameter of the moon's orbit, and they will continue\r\nsubstantially in this position for some two or three centuries to come.\r\n\r\nThe slowness with which these bodies move when far from the sun is\r\nstrikingly illustrated by an equation of celestial mechanics which for\r\nparabolic orbits takes the place of Kepler's Third Law--viz.:\r\n\r\n    r^3 / T^2 = 178,\r\n\r\nwhere _T_ is the time, in years, required for the comet to move from its\r\nperihelion to any remote part of the orbit, whose distance from the sun\r\nis represented, in radii of the earth's orbit, by _r_. If the comet of\r\n1668 had moved in a parabola instead of the ellipse supposed above, how\r\nmany years would have been required to reach its present distance from\r\nthe sun?\r\n\r\n178. RELATION OF COMETS TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM.--The orbits of these comets\r\nillustrate a tendency which is becoming ever more strongly marked.\r\nBecause comet orbits are nearly parabolas, it used to be assumed that\r\nthey were exactly parabolic, and this carried with it the conclusion\r\nthat comets have their origin outside the solar system. It may be so,\r\nand this view is in some degree supported by the fact that these nearly\r\nparabolic orbits of both comets and meteors are tipped at all possible\r\nangles to the plane of the ecliptic instead of lying near it as do the\r\norbits of the planets; and by the further fact that, unlike the planets,\r\nthe comets show no marked tendency to move around their orbits in the\r\ndirection in which the sun rotates upon his axis. There is, in fact, the\r\nutmost confusion among them in this respect, some going one way and some\r\nanother. The law of the solar system (gravitation) is impressed upon\r\ntheir movements, but its order is not.\r\n\r\nBut as observations grow more numerous and more precise, and comet\r\norbits are determined with increasing accuracy, there is a steady gain\r\nin the number of elliptic orbits at the expense of the parabolic ones,\r\nand if comets are of extraneous origin we must admit that a very\r\nconsiderable percentage of them have their velocities slowed down\r\nwithin the solar system, perhaps not so much by the attraction of the\r\nplanets as by the resistance offered to their motion by meteor particles\r\nand swarms along their paths. A striking instance of what may befall a\r\ncomet in this way is shown in Fig. 117, where the tail of a comet\r\nappears sadly distorted and broken by what is presumed to have been a\r\ncollision with a meteor swarm. A more famous case of impeded motion is\r\noffered by the comet which bears the name of Encke. This has a periodic\r\ntime less than that of any other known comet, and at intervals of forty\r\nmonths comes back to perihelion, each time moving in a little smaller\r\norbit than before, unquestionably on account of some resistance which it\r\nhas suffered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Brooks's comet, October 21, 1893.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\n179. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMET.--We saw in § 174 that the sun's action\r\nupon a meteor swarm tends to break it up into a long stream, and the\r\nsame tendency to break up is true of comets whose attenuated substance\r\npresents scant resistance to this force. According to the mathematical\r\nanalysis of Roche, if the comet stood still the sun's tidal force would\r\ntend first to draw it out on line with the sun, just as the earth's\r\ntidal force pulled the moon out of shape (§ 42), and then it would cause\r\nthe lighter part of the comet's substance to flow away from both ends of\r\nthis long diameter. This destructive action of the sun is not limited to\r\ncomets and meteor streams, for it tends to tear the earth and moon to\r\npieces as well; but the densities and the resulting mutual attractions\r\nof their parts are far too great to permit this to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nAs a curiosity of mathematical analysis we may note that a spherical\r\ncloud of meteors, or dust particles weighing a gramme each, and placed\r\nat the earth's distance from the sun, will be broken up and dissipated\r\nby the sun's tidal action if the average distance between the particles\r\nexceeds two yards. Now, the earth is far more dense than such a cloud,\r\nwhose extreme tenuity, however, suggests what we have already learned of\r\nthe small density of comets, and prepares us in their case for an\r\noutflow of particles at both ends of the diameter directed toward the\r\nsun. Something of this kind actually occurs, for the tail of a comet\r\nstreams out on the side opposite to the sun, and in general points away\r\nfrom the sun, as is shown in Fig. 109, and the envelopes and jets rise\r\nup toward the sun; but an inspection of Fig. 106 will show that the tail\r\nand the envelope are too unlike to be produced by one and the same set\r\nof forces.\r\n\r\nIt was long ago suggested that the sun possibly exerts upon a comet's\r\nsubstance a repelling force in addition to the attracting force which we\r\ncall gravity. We think naturally in this connection of the repelling\r\nforce which a charge of electricity exerts upon a similar charge placed\r\non a neighboring body, and we note that if both sun and comet carried a\r\nconsiderable store of electricity upon their surfaces this would furnish\r\njust such a repelling force as seems indicated by the phenomena of\r\ncomets' tails; for the force of gravity would operate between the\r\nsubstance of sun and comet, and on the whole would be the controlling\r\nforce, while the electric charges would produce a repulsion, relatively\r\nfeeble for the big particles and strong for the little ones, since an\r\nelectric charge lies wholly on the surface, while gravity permeates the\r\nwhole mass of a body, and the ratio of volume (gravity) to surface\r\n(electric charge) increases rapidly with increasing size. The repelling\r\nforce would thrust back toward the comet those particles which flowed\r\nout toward the sun, while it would urge forward those which flowed away\r\nfrom it, thus producing the difference in appearance between tail and\r\nenvelopes, the latter being regarded from this standpoint as stunted\r\ntails strongly curved backward. In recent years the Russian astronomer\r\nBredichin has made a careful study of the shape and positions of comets'\r\ntails and finds that they fit with mathematical precision to the\r\ntheories of electric repulsion.\r\n\r\n180. COMET TAILS.--According to Bredichin, a comet's tail is formed by\r\nsomething like the following process: In the head of the comet itself a\r\ncertain part of its matter is broken up into fine bits, single molecules\r\nperhaps, which, as they no longer cling together, may be described as in\r\nthe condition of vapor. By the repellent action of both sun and comet\r\nthese molecules are cast out from the head of the comet and stream away\r\nin the direction opposite to the sun with different velocities, the\r\nheavy ones slowly and the light ones faster, much as particles of smoke\r\nstream away from a smokestack, making for the comet a tail which like a\r\ntrail of smoke is composed of constantly changing particles. The result\r\nof this process is shown in Fig. 118, where the positions of the comet\r\nin its orbit on successive days are marked by the Roman numerals, and\r\nthe broken lines represent the paths of molecules _m^{I}_, _m^{II}_,\r\n_m^{III}_, etc., expelled from it on their several dates and traveling\r\nthereafter in orbits determined by the combined effect of the sun's\r\nattraction, the sun's repulsion, and the comet's repulsion. The comet's\r\nattraction (gravity) is too small to be taken into account. The line\r\ndrawn upward from _VI_ represents the positions of these molecules on\r\nthe sixth day, and shows that all of them are arranged in a tail\r\npointing nearly away from the sun. A similar construction for the other\r\ndates gives the corresponding positions of the tail, always pointing\r\naway from the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Formation of a comet's tail.]\r\n\r\nOnly the lightest kind of molecules--e. g., hydrogen--could drift away\r\nfrom the comet so rapidly as is here shown. The heavier ones, such as\r\ncarbon and iron, would be repelled as strongly by the electric forces,\r\nbut they would be more strongly pulled back by the gravitative forces,\r\nthus producing a much slower separation between them and the head of the\r\ncomet. Construct a figure such as the above, in which the molecules\r\nshall recede from the comet only one eighth as fast as in Fig. 118, and\r\nnote what a different position it gives to the comet's tail. Instead of\r\npointing directly away from the sun, it will be bent strongly to one\r\nside, as is the large plume-shaped tail of the Donati comet shown in\r\nFig. 101. But observe that this comet has also a nearly straight tail,\r\nlike the theoretical one of Fig. 118. We have here two distinct types of\r\ncomet tails, and according to Bredichin there is still another but\r\nunusual type, even more strongly bent to one side of the line joining\r\ncomet and sun, and appearing quite short and stubby. The existence of\r\nthese three types, and their peculiarities of shape and position, are\r\nall satisfactorily accounted for by the supposition that they are made\r\nof different materials. The relative molecular weights of hydrogen, some\r\nof the hydrocarbons, and iron, are such that tails composed of these\r\nmolecules would behave just as do the actual tails observed and\r\nclassified into these three types. The spectroscope shows that these\r\nmaterials--hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and iron--are present in comets, and\r\nleaves little room for doubt of the essential soundness of Bredichin's\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n181. DISINTEGRATION OF COMETS.--We must regard the tail as waste matter\r\ncast off from the comet's head, and although the amount of this matter\r\nis very small, it must in some measure diminish the comet's mass. This\r\nprocess is, of course, most active at the time of perihelion passage,\r\nand if the comet returns to perihelion time after time, as the periodic\r\nones which move in elliptic orbits must do, this waste of material may\r\nbecome a serious matter, leading ultimately to the comet's destruction.\r\nIt is significant in this connection that the periodic comets are all\r\nsmall and inconspicuous, not one of them showing a tail of any\r\nconsiderable dimensions, and it appears probable that they are far\r\nadvanced along the road which, in the case of Biela's comet, led to its\r\ndisintegration. Their fragments are in part strewn through the solar\r\nsystem, making some small fraction of its cloud of cosmic dust, and in\r\npart they have been carried away from the sun and scattered throughout\r\nthe universe along hyperbolic orbits impressed upon them at the time\r\nthey left the comet.\r\n\r\nBut it is not through the tail only that the disintegrating process is\r\nworked out. While Biela's comet is perhaps the most striking instance in\r\nwhich the head has broken up, it is by no means the only one. The Great\r\nComet of 1882 cast off a considerable number of fragments which moved\r\naway as independent though small comets and other more recent comets\r\nhave been seen to do the same. An even more striking phenomenon was the\r\ngradual breaking up of the nucleus of the same comet, 1882, II, into a\r\nhalf dozen nuclei arranged in line like beads upon a string, and\r\npointing along the axis of the tail. See Fig. 119, which shows the\r\nseries of changes observed in the head of this comet.\r\n\r\n182. COMETS AND THE SPECTROSCOPE.--The spectrum presented by comets was\r\nlong a puzzle, and still retains something of that character, although\r\nmuch progress has been made toward an understanding of it. In general it\r\nconsists of two quite distinct parts--first, a faint background of\r\ncontinuous spectrum due to ordinary sunlight reflected from the comet;\r\nand, second, superposed upon this, three bright bands like the carbon\r\nband shown at the middle of Fig. 48, only not so sharply defined. These\r\nbands make a discontinuous spectrum quite similar to that given off by\r\ncompounds of hydrogen and carbon, and of course indicate that a part of\r\nthe comet's light originates in the body itself, which must therefore be\r\nincandescent, or at least must contain some incandescent portions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--The head of the Great Comet of\r\n1882.--WINLOCK.]\r\n\r\nBy heating hydrocarbons in our laboratories until they become\r\nincandescent, something like the comet spectrum may be artificially\r\nproduced, but the best approximation to it is obtained by passing a\r\ndisruptive electrical discharge through a tube in which fragments of\r\nmeteors have been placed. A flash of lightning is a disruptive\r\nelectrical discharge upon a grand scale. Now, meteors and electric\r\nphenomena have been independently brought to our notice in connection\r\nwith comets, and with this suggestion it is easy to frame a general idea\r\nof the physical condition of these objects--for example, a cloud of\r\nmeteors of different sizes so loosely clustered that the average density\r\nof the swarm is very low indeed; the several particles in motion\r\nrelative to each other, as well as to the sun, and disturbed in that\r\nmotion by the sun's tidal action. Each particle carries its own electric\r\ncharge, which may be of higher or lower tension than that of its\r\nneighbor, and is ready to leap across the intervening gap whenever two\r\nparticles approach each other. To these conditions add the inductive\r\neffect of the sun's electric charge, which tends to produce a particular\r\nand artificial distribution of electricity among the comet's particles,\r\nand we may expect to find an endless succession of sparks, tiny\r\nlightning flashes, springing from one particle to another, most frequent\r\nand most vivid when the comet is near the sun, but never strong enough\r\nto be separately visible. Their number is, however, great enough to make\r\nthe comet in part self-luminous with three kinds of light--i. e., the\r\nthree bright bands of its spectrum, whose wave lengths show in the comet\r\nthe same elements and compounds of the elements--carbon, hydrogen, and\r\noxygen--which chemical analysis finds in the fallen meteor. It is not to\r\nbe supposed that these are the only chemical elements in the comet, as\r\nthey certainly are not the only ones in the meteor. They are the easy\r\nones to detect under ordinary circumstances, but in special cases, like\r\nthat of the Great Comet of 1882, whose near approach to the sun rendered\r\nits whole substance incandescent, the spectrum glows with additional\r\nbright lines of sodium, iron, etc.\r\n\r\n183. COLLISIONS.--A question sometimes asked, What would be the effect\r\nof a collision between the earth and a comet? finds its answer in the\r\nresults reached in the preceding sections. There would be a star\r\nshower, more or less brilliant according to the number and size of the\r\npieces which made up the comet's head. If these were like the remains of\r\nthe Biela comet, the shower might even be a very tame one; but a\r\ncollision with a great comet would certainly produce a brilliant\r\nmeteoric display if its head came in contact with the earth. If the\r\ncomet were built of small pieces whose individual weights did not exceed\r\na few ounces or pounds, the earth's atmosphere would prove a perfect\r\nshield against their attacks, reducing the pieces to harmless dust\r\nbefore they could reach the ground, and leaving the earth uninjured by\r\nthe encounter, although the comet might suffer sadly from it. But big\r\nstones in the comet, meteors too massive to be consumed in their flight\r\nthrough the air, might work a very different effect, and by their\r\nbombardment play sad havoc with parts of the earth's surface, although\r\nany such result as the wrecking of the earth, or the destruction of all\r\nlife upon it, does not seem probable. The 40 meteors of § 169 may stand\r\nfor a collision with a small comet. Consult the Bible (Joshua x, 11) for\r\nan example of what might happen with a larger one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIXED STARS\r\n\r\n\r\n184. THE CONSTELLATIONS.--In the earlier chapters the student has\r\nlearned to distinguish between wandering stars (planets) and those fixed\r\nluminaries which remain year after year in the same constellation,\r\nshining for the most part with unvarying brilliancy, and presenting the\r\nmost perfect known image of immutability. Homer and Job and prehistoric\r\nman saw Orion and the Pleiades much as we see them to-day, although the\r\nprecession, by changing their relation to the pole of the heavens, has\r\naltered their risings and settings, and it may be that their luster has\r\nchanged in some degree as they grew old with the passing centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Illustrating the division of the sky into\r\nconstellations.]\r\n\r\nThe division of the sky into constellations dates back to the most\r\nprimitive times, long before the Christian era, and the crooked and\r\nirregular boundaries of these constellations, shown by the dotted lines\r\nin Fig. 120, such as no modern astronomer would devise, are an\r\ninheritance from antiquity, confounded and made worse in its descent to\r\nour day. The boundaries assigned to constellations near the south pole\r\nare much more smooth and regular, since this part of the sky, invisible\r\nto the peoples from whom we inherit, was not studied and mapped until\r\nmore modern times. The old traditions associated with each constellation\r\na figure, often drawn from classical mythology, which was supposed to be\r\nsuggested by the grouping of the stars: thus Ursa Major is a great bear,\r\nstalking across the sky, with the handle of the Dipper for his tail; Leo\r\nis a lion; Cassiopeia, a lady in a chair; Andromeda, a maiden chained\r\nto a rock, etc.; but for the most part the resemblances are far-fetched\r\nand quite too fanciful to be followed by the ordinary eye.\r\n\r\n185. THE NUMBER OF STARS.--\"As numerous as the stars of heaven\" is a\r\nfamiliar figure of speech for expressing the idea of countless number,\r\nbut as applied to the visible stars of the sky the words convey quite a\r\nwrong impression, for, under ordinary circumstances, in a clear sky\r\nevery star to be seen may be counted in the course of a few hours, since\r\nthey do not exceed 3,000 or 4,000, the exact number depending upon\r\natmospheric conditions and the keenness of the individual eye. Test your\r\nown vision by counting the stars of the Pleiades. Six are easily seen,\r\nand you may possibly find as many as ten or twelve; but however many are\r\nseen, there will be a vague impression of more just beyond the limit of\r\nvisibility, and doubtless this impression is partly responsible for the\r\npopular exaggeration of the number of the stars. In fact, much more than\r\nhalf of what we call starlight comes from stars which are separately too\r\nsmall to be seen, but whose number is so great as to more than make up\r\nfor their individual faintness.\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way is just such a cloud of faint stars, and the student who\r\ncan obtain access to a small telescope, or even an opera glass, should\r\nnot fail to turn it toward the Milky Way and see for himself how that\r\nvague stream of light breaks up into shining points, each an independent\r\nstar. These faint stars, which are found in every part of the sky as\r\nwell as in the Milky Way, are usually called _telescopic_, in\r\nrecognition of the fact that they can be seen only in the telescope,\r\nwhile the other brighter ones are known as _lucid stars_.\r\n\r\n186. MAGNITUDES.--The telescopic stars show among themselves an even\r\ngreater range of brightness than do the lucid ones, and the system of\r\nmagnitudes (§ 9) has accordingly been extended to include them, the\r\nfaintest star visible in the greatest telescope of the present time\r\nbeing of the sixteenth or seventeenth magnitude, while, as we have\r\nalready learned, stars on the dividing line between the telescopic and\r\nthe lucid ones are of the sixth magnitude. To compare the amount of\r\nlight received from the stars with that from the planets, and\r\nparticularly from the sun and moon, it has been found necessary to\r\nprolong the scale of magnitudes backward into the negative numbers, and\r\nwe speak of the sun as having a stellar magnitude represented by the\r\nnumber -26.5. The full moon's stellar magnitude is -12, and the planets\r\nrange from -3 (Venus) to +8 (Neptune). Even a very few of the stars are\r\nso bright that negative magnitudes must be used to represent their true\r\nrelation to the fainter ones. Sirius, for example, the brightest of the\r\nfixed stars, is of the -1 magnitude, and such stars as Arcturus and Vega\r\nare of the 0 magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe relation of these magnitudes to each other has been so chosen that a\r\nstar of any one magnitude is very approximately 2.5 times as bright as\r\none of the next fainter magnitude, and this ratio furnishes a convenient\r\nmethod of comparing the amount of light received from different stars.\r\nThus the brightness of Venus is 2.5 × 2.5 times that of Sirius. The full\r\nmoon is 2.5^{9} times as bright as Venus, etc.; only it should be\r\nobserved that the number 2.5 is not exactly the value of the _light\r\nratio_ between two consecutive magnitudes. Strictly this ratio is the\r\n100^{1/5} = 2.5119+, so that to be entirely accurate we must say that\r\na difference of five magnitudes gives a hundredfold difference of\r\nbrightness. In mathematical symbols, if _B_ represents the ratio of\r\nbrightness (quantity of light) of two stars whose magnitudes are _m_ and\r\n_n_, then\r\n\r\n    B = (100)^{(m-n)/5}\r\n\r\nHow much brighter is an ordinary first-magnitude star, such as Aldebaran\r\nor Spica, than a star just visible to the naked eye? How many of the\r\nfaintest stars visible in a great telescope would be required to make\r\none star just visible to the unaided eye? How many full moons must be\r\nput in the sky in order to give an illumination as bright as daylight?\r\nHow large a part of the visible hemisphere would they occupy?\r\n\r\n187. CLASSIFICATION BY MAGNITUDES.--The brightness of all the lucid\r\nstars has been carefully measured with an instrument (photometer)\r\ndesigned for that special purpose, and the following table shows,\r\naccording to the Harvard Photometry, the number of stars in the whole\r\nsky, from pole to pole, which are brighter than the several magnitudes\r\nnamed in the table:\r\n\r\n    The number of stars brighter than magnitude 1.0 is    11\r\n        \"       \"          \"      \"       \"     2.0 \"     39\r\n        \"       \"          \"      \"       \"     3.0 \"    142\r\n        \"       \"          \"      \"       \"     4.0 \"    463\r\n        \"       \"          \"      \"       \"     5.0 \"  1,483\r\n        \"       \"          \"      \"       \"     6.0 \"  4,326\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from this table that there are in the whole sky\r\nonly 4,326 stars visible to the naked eye. The actual number is probably\r\n50 or 60 per cent greater than this, and the normal human eye sees stars\r\nas faint as the magnitude 6.4 or 6.5, the discordance between this\r\nnumber and the previous statement, that the sixth magnitude is the limit\r\nof the naked-eye vision, having been introduced in the attempt to make\r\nprecise and accurate a classification into magnitudes which was at first\r\nonly rough and approximate. This same striving after accuracy leads to\r\nthe introduction of fractional numbers to represent gradations of\r\nbrightness intermediate between whole magnitudes. Thus of the 2,843\r\nstars included between the fifth and sixth magnitudes a certain\r\nproportion are said to be of the 5.1 magnitude, 5.2 magnitude, and so on\r\nto the 5.9 magnitude, even hundredths of a magnitude being sometimes\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nWe have found the number of stars included between the fifth and sixth\r\nmagnitudes by subtracting from the last number of the preceding table\r\nthe number immediately preceding it, and similarly we may find the\r\nnumber included between each other pair of consecutive magnitudes, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Magnitude       0    1    2     3     4       5       6\r\n    Number of stars   11   28   103   321   1,020   2,843\r\n    4 × 3^{m}         12   36   108   324     972   2,916\r\n\r\nIn the last line each number after the first is found by multiplying the\r\npreceding one by 3, and the approximate agreement of each such number\r\nwith that printed above it shows that on the whole, as far as the table\r\ngoes, the fainter stars are approximately three times as numerous as\r\nthose a magnitude brighter.\r\n\r\nThe magnitudes of the telescopic stars have not yet been measured\r\ncompletely, and their exact number is unknown; but if we apply our\r\nprinciple of a threefold increase for each successive magnitude, we\r\nshall find for the fainter stars--those of the tenth and twelfth\r\nmagnitudes--prodigious numbers which run up into the millions, and even\r\nthese are probably too small, since down to the ninth or tenth magnitude\r\nit is certain that the number of the telescopic stars increases from\r\nmagnitude to magnitude in more than a threefold ratio. This is balanced\r\nin some degree by the less rapid increase which is known to exist in\r\nmagnitudes still fainter; and applying our formula without regard to\r\nthese variations in the rate of increase, we obtain as a rude\r\napproximation to the total number of stars down to the fifteenth\r\nmagnitude, 86,000,000. The Herschels, father and son, actually counted\r\nthe number of stars visible in nearly 8,000 sample regions of the sky,\r\nand, inferring the character of the whole sky from these samples, we\r\nfind it to contain 58,500,000 stars; but the magnitude of the faintest\r\nstar visible in their telescope, and included in their count, is rather\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nHow many first-magnitude stars would be needed to give as much light as\r\ndo the 2,843 stars of magnitude 5.0 to 6.0? How many tenth-magnitude\r\nstars are required to give the same amount of light?\r\n\r\nTo the modern man it seems natural to ascribe the different brilliancies\r\nof the stars to their different distances from us; but such was not the\r\ncase 2,000 years ago, when each fixed star was commonly thought to be\r\nfastened to a \"crystal sphere,\" which carried them with it, all at the\r\nsame distance from us, as it turned about the earth. In breaking away\r\nfrom this erroneous idea and learning to think of the sky itself as only\r\nan atmospheric illusion through which we look to stars at very different\r\ndistances beyond, it was easy to fall into the opposite error and to\r\nthink of the stars as being much alike one with another, and, like\r\npebbles on the beach, scattered throughout space with some rough degree\r\nof uniformity, so that in every direction there should be found in equal\r\nmeasure stars near at hand and stars far off, each shining with a luster\r\nproportioned to its remoteness.\r\n\r\n188. DISTANCES OF THE STARS.--Now, in order to separate the true from\r\nthe false in this last mode of thinking about the stars, we need some\r\nknowledge of their real distances from the earth, and in seeking it we\r\nencounter what is perhaps the most delicate and difficult problem in the\r\nwhole range of observational astronomy. As shown in Fig. 121, the\r\nprinciples involved in determining these distances are not fundamentally\r\ndifferent from those employed in determining the moon's distance from\r\nthe earth. Thus, the ellipse at the left of the figure represents the\r\nearth's orbit and the position of the earth at different times of the\r\nyear. The direction of the star _A_ at these several times is shown by\r\nlines drawn through _A_ and prolonged to the background apparently\r\nfurnished by the sky. A similar construction is made for the star _B_,\r\nand it is readily seen that owing to the changing position of the\r\nobserver as he moves around the earth's orbit, both _A_ and _B_ will\r\nappear to move upon the background in orbits shaped like that of the\r\nearth as seen from the star, but having their size dependent upon the\r\nstar's distance, the apparent orbit of _A_ being larger than that of\r\n_B_, because _A_ is nearer the earth. By measuring the angular distance\r\nbetween _A_ and _B_ at opposite seasons of the year (e. g., the angles\r\n_A--Jan.--B_, and _A--July--B_) the astronomer determines from the\r\nchange in this angle how much larger is the one path than the other, and\r\nthus concludes how much nearer is _A_ than _B_. Strictly, the difference\r\nbetween the January and July angles is equal to the difference between\r\nthe angles subtended at _A_ and _B_ by the diameter of the earth's\r\norbit, and if _B_ were so far away that the angle _Jan.--B--July_ were\r\nnothing at all we should get immediately from the observations the angle\r\n_Jan.--A--July_, which would suffice to determine the stars' distance.\r\nSupposing the diameter of the earth's orbit and the angle at _A_ to be\r\nknown, can you make a graphical construction that will determine the\r\ndistance of _A_ from the earth?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Determining a star's parallax.]\r\n\r\nThe angle subtended at _A_ by the radius of the earth's orbit--i. e.,\r\n1/2 (_Jan.--A--July_)--is called the star's parallax, and this is\r\ncommonly used by astronomers as a measure of the star's distance instead\r\nof expressing it in linear units such as miles or radii of the earth's\r\norbit. The distance of a star is equal to the radius of the earth's\r\norbit divided by the parallax, in seconds of arc, and multiplied by the\r\nnumber 206265.\r\n\r\nA weak point of this method of measuring stellar distances is that it\r\nalways gives what is called a relative parallax--i. e., the difference\r\nbetween the parallaxes of _A_ and _B_; and while it is customary to\r\nselect for _B_ a star or stars supposed to be much farther off than _A_,\r\nit may happen, and sometimes does happen, that these comparison stars as\r\nthey are called are as near or nearer than _A_, and give a negative\r\nparallax--i. e., the difference between the angles at _A_ and _B_ proves\r\nto be negative, as it must whenever the star _B_ is nearer than _A_.\r\n\r\nThe first really successful determinations of stellar parallax were made\r\nby Struve and Bessel a little prior to 1840, and since that time the\r\ndistances of perhaps 100 stars have been measured with some degree of\r\nreliability, although the parallaxes themselves are so small--never as\r\ngreat as 1''--that it is extremely difficult to avoid falling into\r\nerror, since even for the nearest star the problem of its distance is\r\nequivalent to finding the distance of an object more than 5 miles away\r\nby looking at it first with one eye and then with the other. Too short a\r\nbase line.\r\n\r\n189. THE SUN AND HIS NEIGHBORS.--The distances of the sun's nearer\r\nneighbors among the stars are shown in Fig. 122, where the two circles\r\nhaving the sun at their center represent distances from it equal\r\nrespectively to 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 times the distance between earth\r\nand sun. In the figure the direction of each star from the sun\r\ncorresponds to its right ascension, as shown by the Roman numerals about\r\nthe outer circle; the true direction of the star from the sun can not,\r\nof course, be shown upon the flat surface of the paper, but it may be\r\nfound by elevating or depressing the star from the surface of the paper\r\nthrough an angle, as seen from the sun, equal to its declination, as\r\nshown in the fifth column of the following table,\r\n\r\n                       _The Sun's Nearest Neighbors_\r\n\r\n  ---+------------------+----------+-------+-----+----------+---------\r\n  No.| STAR.            |Magnitude.| R.

LIGHT YEARS.--The radius of the inner circle in Fig. 122, 1,000,000\r\ntimes the earth's distance from the sun, is a convenient unit in which\r\nto express the stellar distances, and in the preceding table the\r\ndistances of the stars from the sun are expressed in terms of this\r\nunit. To express them in miles the numbers in the table must be\r\nmultiplied by 93,000,000,000,000. The nearest star, [a] Centauri, is\r\n25,000,000,000,000 miles away. But there is another unit in more common\r\nuse--i. e., the distance traveled over by light in the period of one\r\nyear. We have already found (§ 141) that it requires light 8m. 18s. to\r\ncome from the sun to the earth, and it is a simple matter to find from\r\nthis datum that in a year light moves over a space equal to 63,368 radii\r\nof the earth's orbit. This distance is called a _light year_, and the\r\ndistance of the same star, [a] Centauri, expressed in terms of this\r\nunit, is 4.26 years--i. e., it takes light that long to come from the\r\nstar to the earth.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 122 the stellar magnitudes of the stars are indicated by the\r\nsize of the dots--the bigger the dot the brighter the star--and a mere\r\ninspection of the figure will serve to show that within a radius of 30\r\nlight years from the sun bright stars and faint ones are mixed up\r\ntogether, and that, so far as distance is concerned, the sun is only a\r\nmember of this swarm of stars, whose distances apart, each from its\r\nnearest neighbor, are of the same order of magnitude as those which\r\nseparate the sun from the three or four stars nearest it.\r\n\r\nFig. 122 is not to be supposed complete. Doubtless other stars will be\r\nfound whose distance from the sun is less than 2,000,000 radii of the\r\nearth's orbit, but it is not probable that they will ever suffice to\r\nmore than double or perhaps treble the number here shown. The vast\r\nmajority of the stars lie far beyond the limits of the figure.\r\n\r\n191. PROPER MOTIONS.--It is evident that these stars are too far apart\r\nfor their mutual attractions to have much influence one upon another,\r\nand that we have here a case in which, according to § 34, each star is\r\nfree to keep unchanged its state of rest or motion with unvarying\r\nvelocity along a straight line. Their very name, _fixed stars_, implies\r\nthat they are at rest, and so astronomers long believed. Hipparchus (125\r\nB. C.) and Ptolemy (130 A. D.) observed and recorded many allineations\r\namong the stars, in order to give to future generations a means of\r\nsettling this very question of a possible motion of the stars and a\r\nresulting change in their relative positions upon the sky. For example,\r\nthey found at the beginning of the Christian era that the four stars,\r\nCapella, [e] Persei, [a] and [b] Arietis, stood in a straight\r\nline--i. e., upon a great circle of the sky. Verify this by direct\r\nreference to the sky, and see how nearly these stars have kept the same\r\nposition for nearly twenty centuries. Three of them may be identified\r\nfrom the star maps, and the fourth, [e] Persei, is a third-magnitude\r\nstar between Capella and the other two.\r\n\r\nOther allineations given by Ptolemy are: Spica, Arcturus and [b] Bootis;\r\nSpica, [d] Corvi and [g] Corvi; [a] Libræ, Arcturus and [z] Ursæ\r\nMajoris. Arcturus does not now fit very well to these alignments, and\r\nnearly two centuries ago it, together with Aldebaran and Sirius, was on\r\nother grounds suspected to have changed its place in the sky since the\r\ndays of Ptolemy. This discovery, long since fully confirmed, gave a\r\ngreat impetus to observing with all possible accuracy the right\r\nascensions and declinations of the stars, with a view to finding other\r\ncases of what was called _proper motion_--i. e., a motion peculiar to\r\nthe individual star as contrasted with the change of right ascension and\r\ndeclination produced for all stars by the precession.\r\n\r\nSince the middle of the eighteenth century there have been made many\r\nthousands of observations of this kind, whose results have gone into\r\nstar charts and star catalogues, and which are now being supplemented by\r\na photographic survey of the sky that is intended to record permanently\r\nupon photographic plates the position and magnitude of every star in the\r\nheavens down to the fourteenth magnitude, with a view to ultimately\r\ndetermining all their proper motions.\r\n\r\nThe complete achievement of this result is, of course, a thing of the\r\nremote future, but sufficient progress in determining these motions has\r\nbeen made during the past century and a half to show that nearly every\r\nlucid star possesses some proper motion, although in most cases it is\r\nvery small, there being less than 100 known stars in which it amounts\r\nto so much as 1\" per annum--i. e., a rate of motion across the sky which\r\nwould require nearly the whole Christian era to alter a star's direction\r\nfrom us by so much as the moon's angular diameter. The most rapid known\r\nproper motion is that of a telescopic star midway between the equator\r\nand the south pole, which changes its position at the rate of nearly 9\"\r\nper annum, and the next greatest is that of another telescopic star, in\r\nthe northern sky, No. 28 of Fig. 122. It is not until we reach the tenth\r\nplace in a list of large proper motions that we find a bright lucid\r\nstar, No. 1 of Fig. 122. It is a significant fact that for the most part\r\nthe stars with large proper motions are precisely the ones shown in Fig.\r\n122, which is designed to show stars near the earth. This connection\r\nbetween nearness and rapidity of proper motions is indeed what we should\r\nexpect to find, since a given amount of real motion of the star along\r\nits orbit will produce a larger angular displacement, proper motion, the\r\nnearer the star is to the earth, and this fact has guided astronomers in\r\nselecting the stars to be observed for parallax, the proper motion being\r\ndetermined first and the parallax afterward.\r\n\r\n192. THE PATHS OF THE STARS.--We have already seen reason for thinking\r\nthat the orbit along which a star moves is practically a straight line,\r\nand from a study of proper motions, particularly their directions across\r\nthe sky, it appears that these orbits point in all possible ways--north,\r\nsouth, east, and west--so that some of them are doubtless directed\r\nnearly toward or from the sun; others are square to the line joining sun\r\nand star; while the vast majority occupy some position intermediate\r\nbetween these two. Now, our relation to these real motions of the stars\r\nis well illustrated in Fig. 112, where the observer finds in some of the\r\nshooting stars a tremendous proper motion across the sky, but sees\r\nnothing of their rapid approach to him, while others appear to stand\r\nmotionless, although, in fact, they are moving quite as rapidly as are\r\ntheir fellows. The fixed star resembles the shooting star in this\r\nrespect, that its proper motion is only that part of its real motion\r\nwhich lies at right angles to the line of sight, and this needs to be\r\nsupplemented by that other part of the motion which lies parallel to the\r\nline of sight, in order to give us any knowledge of the star's real\r\norbit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Motion of Polaris in the line of sight as\r\ndetermined by the spectroscope. FROST.]\r\n\r\n193. MOTION IN THE LINE OF SIGHT.--It is only within the last 25 years\r\nthat anything whatever has been accomplished in determining these\r\nstellar motions of approach or recession, but within that time much\r\nprogress has been made by applying the Doppler principle (§ 89) to the\r\nstudy of stellar spectra, and at the present time nearly every great\r\ntelescope in the world is engaged upon work of this kind. The shifting\r\nof the lines of the spectrum toward the violet or toward the red end of\r\nthe spectrum indicates with certainty the approach or recession of the\r\nstar, but this shifting, which must be determined by comparing the\r\nstar's spectrum with that of some artificial light showing corresponding\r\nlines, is so small in amount that its accurate measurement is a matter\r\nof extreme difficulty, as may be seen from Fig. 123. This cut shows\r\nalong its central line a part of the spectrum of Polaris, between wave\r\nlengths 4,450 and 4,600 tenth meters, while above and below are the\r\ncorresponding parts of the spectrum of an electric spark whose light\r\npassed through the same spectroscope and was photographed upon the same\r\nplate with that of Polaris. This comparison spectrum is, as it should\r\nbe, a discontinuous or bright-line one, while the spectrum of the star\r\nis a continuous one, broken only by dark gaps or lines, many of which\r\nhave no corresponding lines in the comparison spectrum. But a certain\r\nnumber of lines in the two spectra do correspond, save that the dark\r\nline is always pushed a very little toward the direction of shorter wave\r\nlengths, showing that this star is approaching the earth. This spectrum\r\nwas photographed for the express purpose of determining the star's\r\nmotion in the line of sight, and with it there should be compared Figs.\r\n124 and 125, which show in the upper part of each a photograph obtained\r\nwithout comparison spectra by allowing the star's light to pass through\r\nsome prisms placed just in front of the telescope. The lower section of\r\neach figure shows an enlargement of the original photograph, bringing\r\nout its details in a way not visible to the unaided eye. In the enlarged\r\nspectrum of [b] Aurigæ a rate of motion equal to that of the earth in\r\nits orbit would be represented by a shifting of 0.03 of a millimeter in\r\nthe position of the broad, hazy lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--Spectrum of [b] Aurigæ.--PICKERING.]\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulty of dealing with such small quantities as the\r\nabove, very satisfactory results are now obtained, and from them it is\r\nknown that the velocities of stars in the line of sight are of the same\r\norder of magnitude as the velocities of the planets in their orbits,\r\nranging all the way from 0 to 60 miles per second--more than 200,000\r\nmiles per hour--which latter velocity, according to Campbell, is the\r\nrate at which [m] Cassiopeiæ is approaching the sun.\r\n\r\nThe student should not fail to note one important difference between\r\nproper motions and the motions determined spectroscopically: the latter\r\nare given directly in miles per second, or per hour, while the former\r\nare expressed in angular measure, seconds of arc, and there can be no\r\ndirect comparison between the two until by means of the known distances\r\nof the stars their proper motions are converted from angular into linear\r\nmeasure. We are brought thus to the very heart of the matter; parallax,\r\nproper motion, and motion in the line of sight are intimately related\r\nquantities, all of which are essential to a knowledge of the real\r\nmotions of the stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--Spectrum of Pollux.--PICKERING.]\r\n\r\n194. STAR DRIFT.--An illustration of how they may be made to work\r\ntogether is furnished by some of the stars--which make up the Great\r\nDipper--[b], [g], [e], and [z] Ursæ Majoris, whose proper motions have\r\nlong been known to point in nearly the same direction across the sky and\r\nto be nearly equal in amount. More recently it has been found that these\r\nstars are all moving toward the sun with approximately the same\r\nvelocity--18 miles per second. One other star of the Dipper, [d] Ursæ\r\nMajoris, shares in the common proper motion, but its velocity in the\r\nline of sight has not yet been determined with the spectroscope. These\r\nsimilar motions make it probable that the stars are really traveling\r\ntogether through space along parallel lines; and on the supposition\r\nthat such is the case it is quite possible to write out a set of\r\nequations which shall involve their known proper motions and motions in\r\nthe line of sight, together with their unknown distances and the unknown\r\ndirection and velocity of their real motion along their orbits. Solving\r\nthese equations for the values of the unknown quantities, it is found\r\nthat the five stars probably lie in a plane which is turned nearly\r\nedgewise toward us, and that in this plane they are moving about twice\r\nas fast as the earth moves around the sun, and are at a distance from us\r\nrepresented by a parallax of less than 0.02\"--i. e., six times as great\r\nas the outermost circle in Fig. 122. A most extraordinary system of\r\nstars which, although separated from each other by distances as great as\r\nthe whole breadth of Fig. 122, yet move along in parallel paths which it\r\nis difficult to regard as the result of chance, and for which it is\r\nequally difficult to frame an explanation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--The Great Dipper, past, present, and future.]\r\n\r\nThe stars [a] and [ê] of the Great Dipper do not share in this motion,\r\nand must ultimately part company with the other five, to the complete\r\ndestruction of the Dipper's shape. Fig. 126 illustrates this change of\r\nshape, the upper part of the figure (_a_) showing these seven stars as\r\nthey were grouped at a remote epoch in the past, while the lower\r\nsection (_c_) shows their position for an equally remote epoch in\r\nthe future. There is no resemblance to a dipper in either of these\r\nconfigurations, but it should be observed that in each of them the stars\r\n[a] and [ê] keep their relative position unaltered, and the other five\r\nstars also keep together, the entire change of appearance being due to\r\nthe changing positions of these two groups with respect to each other.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon of groups of stars moving together is called _star\r\ndrift_, and quite a number of cases of it are found in different parts\r\nof the sky. The Pleiades are perhaps the most conspicuous one, for here\r\nsome sixty or more stars are found traveling together along similar\r\npaths. Repeated careful measurements of the relative positions of stars\r\nin this cluster show that one of the lucid stars and four or five of the\r\ntelescopic ones do not share in this motion, and therefore are not to be\r\nconsidered as members of the group, but rather as isolated stars which,\r\nfor a time, chance to be nearly on line with the Pleiades, and probably\r\nfarther off, since their proper motions are smaller.\r\n\r\nTo rightly appreciate the extreme slowness with which proper motions\r\nalter the constellations, the student should bear in mind that the\r\nchanges shown in passing from one section of Fig. 126 to the next\r\nrepresent the effect of the present proper motions of the stars\r\naccumulated for a period of 200,000 years. Will the stars continue to\r\nmove in straight paths for so long a time?\r\n\r\n195. THE SUN'S WAY.--Another and even more interesting application of\r\nproper motions and motions in the line of sight is the determination\r\nfrom them of the sun's orbit among the stars. The principle involved is\r\nsimple enough. If the sun moves with respect to the stars and carries\r\nthe earth and the other planets year after year into new regions of\r\nspace, our changing point of view must displace in some measure every\r\nstar in the sky save those which happen to be exactly on the line of the\r\nsun's motion, and even these will show its effect by their apparent\r\nmotion of approach or recession along the line of sight. So far as their\r\nown orbital motions are concerned, there is no reason to suppose that\r\nmore stars move north than south, or that more go east than west; and\r\nwhen we find in their proper motions a distinct tendency to radiate from\r\na point somewhere near the bright star Vega and to converge toward a\r\npoint on the opposite side of the sky, we infer that this does not come\r\nfrom any general drift of the stars in that direction, but that it marks\r\nthe course of the sun among them. That it is moving along a straight\r\nline pointing toward Vega, and that at least a part of the velocities\r\nwhich the spectroscope shows in the line of sight, comes from the motion\r\nof the sun and earth. Working along these lines, Kapteyn finds that the\r\nsun is moving through space with a velocity of 11 miles per second,\r\nwhich is decidedly below the average rate of stellar motion--19 miles\r\nper second.\r\n\r\n196. DISTANCE OF SIRIAN AND SOLAR STARS.--By combining this rate of\r\nmotion of the sun with the average proper motions of the stars of\r\ndifferent magnitudes, it is possible to obtain some idea of the average\r\ndistance from us of a first-magnitude star or a sixth-magnitude star,\r\nwhich, while it gives no information about the actual distance of any\r\nparticular star, does show that on the whole the fainter stars are more\r\nremote. But here a broad distinction must be drawn. By far the larger\r\npart of the stars belong to one of two well-marked classes, called\r\nrespectively Sirian and solar stars, which are readily distinguished\r\nfrom each other by the kind of spectrum they furnish. Thus [b] Aurigæ\r\nbelongs to the Sirian class, as does every other star which has a\r\nspectrum like that of Fig. 124, while Pollux is a solar star presenting\r\nin Fig. 125 a spectrum like that of the sun, as do the other stars of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nTwo thirds of the sun's near neighbors, shown in Fig. 122, have spectra\r\nof the solar type, and in general stars of this class are nearer to us\r\nthan are the stars with spectra unlike that of the sun. The average\r\ndistance of a solar star of the first magnitude is very approximately\r\nrepresented by the outer circle in Fig. 122, 2,000,000 times the\r\ndistance of the sun from the earth; while the corresponding distance for\r\na Sirian star of the first magnitude is represented by the number\r\n4,600,000.\r\n\r\nA third-magnitude star is on the average twice as far away as one of the\r\nfirst magnitude, a fifth-magnitude star four times as far off, etc.,\r\neach additional two magnitudes doubling the average distance of the\r\nstars, at least down to the eighth magnitude and possibly farther,\r\nalthough beyond this limit we have no certain knowledge. Put in another\r\nway, the naked eye sees many Sirian stars which _may_ have \"gone out\"\r\nand ceased to shine centuries ago, for the light by which we now see\r\nthem left those stars before the discovery of America by Columbus. For\r\nthe student of mathematical tastes we note that the results of Kapteyn's\r\ninvestigation of the mean distances (_D_) of the stars of magnitude\r\n(_m_) may be put into two equations:\r\n\r\n    For Solar Stars, D = 23 × 2^{m/2}\r\n\r\n    For Sirian Stars, D = 52 × 2^{m/2}\r\n\r\nwhere the coefficients 23 and 52 are expressed in light years. How long\r\na time is required for light to come from an average solar star of the\r\nsixth magnitude?\r\n\r\n197. CONSEQUENCES OF STELLAR DISTANCE.--The amount of light which comes\r\nto us from any luminous body varies inversely as the square of its\r\ndistance, and since many of the stars are changing their distance from\r\nus quite rapidly, it must be that with the lapse of time they will grow\r\nbrighter or fainter by reason of this altered distance. But the\r\ndistances themselves are so great that the most rapid known motion in\r\nthe line of sight would require more than 1,000 years (probably several\r\nthousand) to produce any perceptible change in brilliancy.\r\n\r\nThe law in accordance with which this change of brilliancy takes place\r\nis that the distance must be increased or diminished tenfold in order to\r\nproduce a change of five magnitudes in the brightness of the object, and\r\nwe may apply this law to determine the sun's rank among the stars. If it\r\nwere removed to the distance of an average first-, or second-, or\r\nthird-magnitude star, how would its light compare with that of the\r\nstars? The average distance of a third-magnitude star of the solar type\r\nis, as we have seen above, 4,000,000 times the sun's distance from the\r\nearth, and since 4,000,000 = 10^{6.6}, we find that at this distance the\r\nsun's stellar magnitude would be altered by 6.6 × 5 magnitudes, and\r\nwould therefore be -26.5 + 33.0 = 6.5--i. e., the sun if removed to the\r\naverage distance of the third-magnitude stars of its type would be\r\nreduced to the very limit of naked-eye visibility. It must therefore be\r\nrelatively small and feeble as compared with the brightness of the\r\naverage star. It is only its close proximity to us that makes the sun\r\nlook brighter than the stars.\r\n\r\nThe fixed stars may have planets circling around them, but an\r\napplication of the same principles will show how hopeless is the\r\nprospect of ever seeing them in a telescope. If the sun's nearest\r\nneighbor, [a] Centauri, were attended by a planet like Jupiter, this\r\nplanet would furnish to us no more light than does a star of the\r\ntwenty-second magnitude--i. e., it would be absolutely invisible, and\r\nwould remain invisible in the most powerful telescope yet built, even\r\nthough its bulk were increased to equal that of the sun. Let the student\r\nmake the computation leading to this result, assuming the stellar\r\nmagnitude of Jupiter to be -1.7.\r\n\r\n198. DOUBLE STARS.--In the constellation Taurus, not far from Aldebaran,\r\nis the fourth-magnitude star [th] Tauri, which can readily be seen to\r\nconsist of two stars close together. The star [a] Capricorni is plainly\r\ndouble, and a sharp eye can detect that one of the faint stars which\r\nwith Vega make a small equilateral triangle, is also a double star.\r\nLook for them in the sky.\r\n\r\nIn the strict language of astronomy the term double star would not be\r\napplied to the first two of these objects, since it is usually\r\nrestricted to those stars whose angular distance from each other is so\r\nsmall that in the telescope they appear much as do the stars named above\r\nto the naked eye--i. e., their angular separation is measured by a few\r\nseconds or fractions of a single second, instead of the six minutes\r\nwhich separate the component stars of [th] Tauri or [a] Capricorni.\r\nThere are found in the sky many thousands of these close double stars,\r\nof which some are only optically double--i. e., two stars nearly on line\r\nwith the earth but at very different distances from it--while more of\r\nthem are really what they seem, stars near each other, and in many cases\r\nnear enough to influence each other's motion. These are called _binary_\r\nsystems, and in cases of this kind the principles of celestial mechanics\r\nset forth in Chapter IV hold true, and we may expect to find each\r\ncomponent of a double star moving in a conic section of some kind,\r\nhaving its focus at the common center of gravity of the two stars.\r\nWe are thus presented with problems of orbital motion quite similar\r\nto those which occur in the solar system, and careful telescopic\r\nobservations are required year after year to fix the relative positions\r\nof the two stars--i. e., their angular separation, which it is customary\r\nto call their _distance_, and their direction one from the other, which\r\nis called _position angle_.\r\n\r\n199. ORBITS OF DOUBLE STARS.--The sun's nearest neighbor, [a] Centauri,\r\nis such a double star, whose position angle and distance have been\r\nmeasured by successive generations of astronomers for more than a\r\ncentury, and Fig. 127 shows the result of plotting their observations.\r\nEach black dot that lies on or near the circumference of the long\r\nellipse stands for an observed direction and distance of the fainter of\r\nthe two stars from the brighter one, which is represented by the small\r\ncircle at the intersection of the lines inside the ellipse. It appears\r\nfrom the figure that during this time the one star has gone completely\r\naround the other, as a planet goes around the sun, and the true orbit\r\nmust therefore be an ellipse having one of its foci at the center\r\nof gravity of the two stars. The other star moves in an ellipse of\r\nprecisely similar shape, but probably smaller size, since the dimensions\r\nof the two orbits are inversely proportional to the masses of the two\r\nbodies, but it is customary to neglect this motion of the larger star\r\nand to give to the smaller one an orbit whose diameter is equal to the\r\nsum of the diameters of the two real orbits. This practice, which has\r\nbeen followed in Fig. 127, gives correctly the relative positions of the\r\ntwo stars, and makes one orbit do the work of two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--The orbit of [a] Centauri.--SEE.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 127 the bright star does not fall anywhere near the focus of the\r\nellipse marked out by the smaller one, and from this we infer that the\r\nfigure does not show the true shape of the orbit, which is certainly\r\ndistorted, foreshortened, by the fact that we look obliquely down upon\r\nits plane. It is possible, however, by mathematical analysis, to find\r\njust how much and in what direction that plane should be turned in order\r\nto bring the focus of the ellipse up to the position of the principal\r\nstar, and thus give the true shape and size of the orbit. See Fig. 128\r\nfor a case in which the true orbit is turned exactly edgewise toward the\r\nearth, and the small star, which really moves in an ellipse like that\r\nshown in the figure, appears to oscillate to and fro along a straight\r\nline drawn through the principal star, as shown at the left of the\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nIn the case of [a] Centauri the true orbit proves to have a major\r\naxis 47 times, and a minor axis 40 times, as great as the distance of\r\nthe earth from the sun. The orbit, in fact, is intermediate in size\r\nbetween the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, and the periodic time of the\r\nstar in this orbit is 81 years, a little less than the period of Uranus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Apparent orbit and real orbit of the double\r\nstar 42 Comæ Berenicis.--SEE.]\r\n\r\n200. MASSES OF DOUBLE STARS.--If we apply to this orbit Kepler's Third\r\nLaw in the form given it at page 179, we shall find--\r\n\r\n    a^3 / T^2 = (23.5)^3 / (81)^2 = k (M + m),\r\n\r\nwhere _M_ and _m_ represent the masses of the two stars. We have already\r\nseen that _k_, the gravitation constant, is equal to 1 when the masses\r\nare measured in terms of the sun's mass taken as unity, and when _T_ and\r\n_a_ are expressed in years and radii of the earth's orbit respectively,\r\nand with this value of _k_ we may readily find from the above equation,\r\n_M_ + _m_ = 2.5--i. e., the combined mass of the two components of\r\n[a] Centauri is equal to rather more than twice the mass of the\r\nsun. It is not every double star to which this process of weighing can\r\nbe applied. The major axis of the orbit, _a_, is found from the\r\nobservations in angular measure, 35\" in this case, and it is only when\r\nthe parallax of the star is known that this can be converted into the\r\nrequired linear units, radii of the earth's orbit, by dividing the\r\nangular major axis by the parallax; 47 = 35\" ÷ 0.75\".\r\n\r\nOur list of distances (§ 189) contains four double stars whose periodic\r\ntimes and major axes have been fairly well determined, and we find in\r\nthe accompanying table the information which they give about the masses\r\nof double stars and the size of the orbits in which they move:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------+----------+-------\r\n  STAR.                | Major | Minor | Periodic | Mass.\r\n                       | axis. | axis. | time.    |\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------+----------+-------\r\n  [a] Centauri         |  47   |  40   |   81 y.  |   2\r\n  70 Ophiuchi          |  56   |  48   |   88     |   3\r\n  Procyon              |  34   |  31   |   40     |   3\r\n  Sirius               |  43   |  34   |   52     |   4\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------+----------+-------\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Uranus, diameter = 38, and Neptune, diameter = 60, are of\r\nmuch the same size as these double-star orbits; but the planetary orbits\r\nare nearly circular, while in every case the double stars show a\r\nsubstantial difference between the long and short diameters of their\r\norbits. This is a characteristic feature of most double-star orbits, and\r\nseems to stand in some relation to their periodic times, for, on the\r\naverage, the longer the time required by a star to make its orbital\r\nrevolution the more eccentric is its orbit likely to prove.\r\n\r\nAnother element of the orbits of double stars, which stands in even\r\ncloser relation to the periodic time, is the major axis; the smaller the\r\nlong diameter of the orbit the more rapid is the motion and the shorter\r\nthe periodic time, so that astronomers in search of interesting\r\ndouble-star orbits devote themselves by preference to those stars whose\r\ndistance apart is so small that they can barely be distinguished one\r\nfrom the other in the telescope.\r\n\r\nAlthough the half-dozen stars contained in the table all have orbits of\r\nmuch the same size and with much the same periodic time as those in\r\nwhich Uranus and Neptune move, this is by no means true of all the\r\ndouble stars, many of which have periods running up into the hundreds if\r\nnot thousands of years, while a few complete their orbital revolutions\r\nin periods comparable with, or even shorter than, that of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n201. DARK STARS.--Procyon, the next to the last star of the preceding\r\ntable, calls for some special mention, as the determination of its mass\r\nand orbit stands upon a rather different basis from that of the other\r\nstars. More than half a century ago it was discovered that its proper\r\nmotion was not straight and uniform after the fashion of ordinary stars,\r\nbut presented a series of loops like those marked out by a bright point\r\non the rim of a swiftly running bicycle wheel. The hub may move straight\r\nforward with uniform velocity, but the point near the tire goes up and\r\ndown, and, while sharing in the forward motion of the hub, runs\r\nsometimes ahead of it, sometimes behind, and such seemed to be the\r\nmotion of Procyon and of Sirius as well. Bessel, who discovered it, did\r\nnot hesitate to apply the laws of motion, and to affirm that this\r\nvisible change of the star's motion pointed to the presence of an unseen\r\ncompanion, which produced upon the motions of Sirius and Procyon just\r\nsuch effects as the visible companions produce in the motions of double\r\nstars. A new kind of star, dark instead of bright, was added to the\r\nastronomer's domain, and its discoverer boldly suggested the possible\r\nexistence of many more. \"That countless stars are visible is clearly no\r\nargument against the existence of as many more invisible ones.\" \"There\r\nis no reason to think radiance a necessary property of celestial\r\nbodies.\" But most astronomers were incredulous, and it was not until\r\n1862 that, in the testing of a new and powerful telescope just built, a\r\ndark star was brought to light and the companion of Sirius actually\r\nseen. The visual discovery of the dark companion of Procyon is of still\r\nmore recent date (November, 1896), when it was detected with the great\r\ntelescope of the Lick Observatory. This discovery is so recent that the\r\norbit is still very uncertain, being based almost wholly upon the\r\nvariations in the proper motion of the star, and while the periodic time\r\nmust be very nearly correct, the mass of the stars and dimensions of the\r\norbit may require considerable correction.\r\n\r\nThe companion of Sirius is about ten magnitudes and that of Procyon\r\nabout twelve magnitudes fainter than the star itself. How much more\r\nlight does the bright star give than its faint companion? Despite the\r\ntremendous difference of brightness represented by the answer to this\r\nquestion, the mass of Sirius is only about twice as great as that of its\r\ncompanion, and for Procyon the ratio does not exceed five or six.\r\n\r\nThe visual discovery of the companions to Sirius and Procyon removes\r\nthem from the list of dark stars, but others still remain unseen,\r\nalthough their existence is indicated by variable proper motions or by\r\nvariable orbital motion, as in the case of [z] Cancri, where one\r\nof the components of a triple star moves around the other two in a\r\nseries of loops whose presence indicates a disturbing body which has\r\nnever yet been seen.\r\n\r\n202. MULTIPLE STARS.--Combinations of three, four, or more stars close\r\nto each other, like [z] Cancri, are called multiple stars, and\r\nwhile they are far from being as common as are double stars, there is a\r\nconsiderable number of them in the sky, 100 or more as against the more\r\nthan 10,000 double stars that are known. That their relative motions are\r\nsubject to the law of gravitation admits of no serious doubt, but\r\nmathematical analysis breaks down in face of the difficulties here\r\npresented, and no astronomer has ever been able to determine what will\r\nbe the general character of the motions in such a system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Illustrating the motion of a spectroscopic\r\nbinary.]\r\n\r\n203. SPECTROSCOPIC BINARIES.--In the year 1890 Professor Pickering, of\r\nthe Harvard Observatory, announced the discovery of a new class of\r\ndouble stars, invisible as such in even the most powerful telescope,\r\nand producing no perturbations such as have been considered above, but\r\nshowing in their spectrum that two or more bodies must be present in the\r\nsource of light which to the eye is indistinguishable from a single\r\nstar. In Fig. 129 we suppose _A_ and _B_ to be the two components of a\r\ndouble star, each moving in its own orbit about their common center of\r\ngravity, _C_, whose distance from the earth is several million times\r\ngreater than the distance between the stars themselves. Under such\r\ncircumstances no telescope could distinguish between the two stars,\r\nwhich would appear fused into one; but the smaller the orbit the more\r\nrapid would be their motion in it, and if this orbit were turned\r\nedgewise toward the earth, as is supposed in the figure, whenever the\r\nstars were in the relative position there shown, _A_ would be rapidly\r\napproaching the earth by reason of its orbital motion, while _B_ would\r\nmove away from it, so that in accordance with the Doppler principle the\r\nlines composing their respective spectra would be shifted in opposite\r\ndirections, thus producing a doubling of the lines, each single line\r\nbreaking up into two, like the double-sodium line _D_, only not spaced\r\nso far apart. When the stars have moved a quarter way round their orbit\r\nto the points _A´_, _B´_, their velocities are turned at right angles to\r\nthe line of sight and the spectrum returns to the normal type with\r\nsingle lines, only to break up again when after another quarter\r\nrevolution their velocities are again parallel with the line of sight.\r\nThe interval of time between consecutive doublings of the lines in the\r\nspectrum thus furnishes half the time of a revolution in the orbit. The\r\ndistance between the components of a double line shows by means of the\r\nDoppler principle how fast the stars are traveling, and this in\r\nconnection with the periodic times fixes the size of the orbit, provided\r\nwe assume that it is turned exactly edgewise to the earth. This\r\nassumption may not be quite true, but even though the orbit should\r\ndeviate considerably from this position, it will still present the\r\nphenomenon of the double lines whose displacement will now show\r\nsomething less than the true velocities of the stars in their orbits,\r\nsince the spectroscope measures only that component of the whole\r\nvelocity which is directed toward the earth, and it is important to note\r\nthat the real orbits and masses of these _spectroscopic binaries_, as\r\nthey are called, will usually be somewhat larger than those indicated by\r\nthe spectroscope, since it is only in exceptional cases that the orbit\r\nwill be turned exactly edgewise to us.\r\n\r\nThe bright star Capella is an excellent illustration of these\r\nspectroscopic binaries. At intervals of a little less than a month the\r\nlines of its spectrum are alternately single and double, their maximum\r\nseparation corresponding to a velocity in the line of sight amounting to\r\n37 miles per second. Each component of a doubled line appears to be\r\nshifted an equal amount from the position occupied by the line when it\r\nis single, thus indicating equal velocities and equal masses for the two\r\ncomponent stars whose periodic time in their orbit is 104 days. From\r\nthis periodic time, together with the velocity of the star's motion, let\r\nthe student show that the diameter of the orbit--i. e., the distance of\r\nthe stars from each other--is approximately 53,000,000 miles, and that\r\ntheir combined mass is a little less than that of [a] Centauri, provided\r\nthat their orbit plane is turned exactly edgewise toward the earth.\r\n\r\nThere are at the present time (1901) 34 spectroscopic binaries known,\r\nincluding among them such stars as Polaris, Capella, Algol, Spica, [b]\r\nAurigæ, [z] Ursæ Majoris, etc., and their number is rapidly increasing,\r\nabout one star out of every seven whose motion in the line of sight is\r\ndetermined proving to be a binary or, as in the case of Polaris,\r\npossibly triple. On account of smaller distance apart their periodic\r\ntimes are much shorter than those of the ordinary double stars, and\r\nrange from a few days up to several months--more than two years in the\r\ncase of [ê] Pegasi, which has the longest known period of any star of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nSpectroscopic binaries agree with ordinary double stars in having masses\r\nrather greater than that of the sun, but there is as yet no assured case\r\nof a mass ten times as great as that of the sun.\r\n\r\n204. VARIABLE STARS.--Attention has already been drawn (§ 23) to the\r\nfact that some stars shine with a changing brightness--e. g., Algol, the\r\nmost famous of these _variable stars_, at its maximum of brightness\r\nfurnishes three times as much light as when at its minimum, and other\r\nvariable stars show an even greater range. The star [o] Ceti has\r\nbeen named Mira (Latin, _the wonderful_), from its extraordinary range\r\nof brightness, more than six-hundred-fold. For the greater part of the\r\ntime this star is invisible to the naked eye, but during some three\r\nmonths in every year it brightens up sufficiently to be seen, rising\r\nquite rapidly to its maximum brilliancy, which is sometimes that of a\r\nsecond-magnitude star, but more frequently only third or even fourth\r\nmagnitude, and, after shining for a few weeks with nearly maximum\r\nbrilliancy, falling off to become invisible for a time and then return\r\nto its maximum brightness after an interval of eleven months from the\r\npreceding maximum. In 1901 it should reach its greatest brilliancy about\r\nmidsummer, and a month earlier than this for each succeeding year. Find\r\nit by means of the star map, and by comparing its brightness from night\r\nto night with neighboring stars of about the same magnitude see how it\r\nchanges with respect to them.\r\n\r\nThe interval of time from maximum to maximum of brightness--331.6 days\r\nfor Mira--is called the star's period, and within its period a star\r\nregularly variable runs through all its changes of brilliancy, much as\r\nthe weather runs through its cycle of changes in the period of a year.\r\nBut, as there are wet years and dry ones, hot years and cold, so also\r\nwith variable stars, many of them show differences more or less\r\npronounced between different periods, and one such difference has\r\nalready been noted in the case of Mira; its maximum brilliancy is\r\ndifferent in different years. So, too, the length of the period\r\nfluctuates in many cases, as does every other circumstance connected\r\nwith it, and predictions of what such a variable star will do are\r\nnotoriously unreliable.\r\n\r\n205. THE ALGOL VARIABLES.--On the other hand, some variable stars\r\npresent an almost perfect regularity, repeating their changes time after\r\ntime with a precision like that of clockwork. Algol is one type of these\r\nregular variables, having a period of 68.8154 hours, during six sevenths\r\nof which time it shines with unchanging luster as a star of the 2.3\r\nmagnitude, but during the remaining 9 hours of each period it runs down\r\nto the 3.5 magnitude, and comes back again, as is shown by a curve in\r\nFig. 130. The horizontal scale here represents hours, reckoned from the\r\ntime of the star's minimum brightness, and the vertical scale shows\r\nstellar magnitudes. Such a diagram is called the star's light curve, and\r\nwe may read from it that at any time between 5h. and 32h. after the time\r\nof minimum the star's magnitude is 2.32; at 2h. after a minimum the\r\nmagnitude is 2.88, etc. What is the magnitude an hour and a half before\r\nthe time of minimum? What is the magnitude 43 days after a minimum?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--The light curve of Algol.]\r\n\r\nThe arrows shown in Fig. 130 are a feature not usually found with light\r\ncurves, but in this case each one represents a spectroscopic\r\ndetermination of the motion of Algol in the line of sight. These\r\nobservations extended over a period of more than two years, but they are\r\nplotted in the figure with reference to the number of hours each one\r\npreceded or followed a minimum of the star's light, and each arrow shows\r\nnot only the direction of the star's motion along the line of sight, the\r\narrows pointing down denoting approach of the star toward the earth, but\r\nalso its velocity, each square of the ruling corresponding to 10\r\nkilometers (6.2 miles per second). The differences of velocity shown by\r\nadjacent arrows come mainly from errors of observation and furnish some\r\nidea of how consistent among themselves such observations are, but there\r\ncan be no doubt that before minimum the star is moving away from the\r\nearth, and after minimum is approaching it. It is evident from these\r\nobservations that in Algol we have to do with a spectroscopic binary,\r\none of whose components is a dark star which, once in each revolution,\r\npartially eclipses the bright star and produces thus the variations in\r\nits light. By combining the spectroscopic observations with the\r\nvariations in the star's light, Vogel finds that the bright star, Algol,\r\nitself has a diameter somewhat greater than that of the sun, but is of\r\nlow density, so that its mass is less than half that of the sun, while\r\nthe dark star is a very little smaller than the sun and has about a\r\nquarter of its mass. The distance between the two stars, dark and\r\nbright, is 3,200,000 miles. Fig. 129, which is drawn to scale, shows the\r\nrelative positions and sizes of these stars as well as the orbits in\r\nwhich they move.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact already noted that close binary systems exist in\r\nconsiderable numbers is sufficient to make it probable that a certain\r\nproportion of these stars would have their orbit planes turned so nearly\r\nedgewise toward the earth as to produce eclipses, and corresponding to\r\nthis probability there are already known no less than 15 stars of the\r\nAlgol type of eclipse variables, and only a beginning has been made in\r\nthe search for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--The light curve of [b] Lyræ.]\r\n\r\n206. VARIABLES OF THE [b] LYRÆ TYPE.--In addition to these there is a\r\ncertain further number of binary variables in which both components are\r\nbright and where the variation of brightness follows a very different\r\ncourse. Capella would be such a variable if its orbit plane were\r\ndirected exactly toward the earth, and the fact that its light is not\r\nvariable shows conclusively that such is not the position of the orbit.\r\nFig. 131 represents the light curve of one of the best-known variable\r\nsystems of this second type, that of [b] Lyræ, whose period is 12 days\r\n21.8 hours, and the student should read from the curve the magnitude of\r\nthe star for different times during this interval. According to Myers,\r\nthis light curve and the spectroscopic observations of the star point to\r\nthe existence of a binary star of very remarkable character, such as is\r\nshown, together with its orbit and a scale of miles, in Fig. 132. Note\r\nthe tide which each of these stars raises in the other, thus changing\r\ntheir shapes from spheres into ellipsoids. The astonishing dimensions of\r\nthese stars are in part compensated by their very low density, which is\r\nless than that of air, so that their masses are respectively only 10\r\ntimes and 21 times that of the sun! But these dimensions and masses\r\nperhaps require confirmation, since they depend upon spectroscopic\r\nobservations of doubtful interpretation. In Fig. 132 what relative\r\npositions must the stars occupy in their orbit in order that their\r\ncombined light should give [b] Lyræ its maximum brightness? What\r\nposition will furnish a minimum brightness?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--The system of [b] Lyræ.--MYERS.]\r\n\r\n207. VARIABLES OF LONG AND SHORT PERIODS.--It must not be supposed that\r\nall variable stars are binaries which eclipse each other. By far the\r\nlarger part of them, like Mira, are not to be accounted for in this way,\r\nand a distinction which is pretty well marked in the length of their\r\nperiods is significant in this connection. There is a considerable\r\nnumber of variable stars with periods shorter than a month, and there\r\nare many having periods longer than 6 months, but there are very few\r\nhaving periods longer than 18 months, or intermediate between 1 month\r\nand 6 months, so that it is quite customary to divide variable stars\r\ninto two classes--those of long period, 6 months or more, and those of\r\nshort period less than 6 months, and that this distinction corresponds\r\nto some real difference in the stars themselves is further marked by the\r\nfact that the long-period variables are prevailingly red in color, while\r\nthe short-period stars are almost without exception white or very pale\r\nyellow. In fact, the longer the period the redder the star, although it\r\nis not to be inferred that all red stars are variable; a considerable\r\npercentage of them shine with constant light. The eclipse explanation of\r\nvariability holds good only for short-period variables, and possibly not\r\nfor all of them, while for the long-period variables there is no\r\nexplanation which commands the general assent of astronomers, although\r\nunverified hypotheses are plenty.\r\n\r\nThe number of stars known to be variable is about 400, while a\r\nconsiderable number of others are \"suspected,\" and it would not be\r\nsurprising if a large fraction of all the stars should be found to\r\nfluctuate a little in brightness. The sun's spots may suffice to make it\r\na variable star with a period of 11 years.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of new variables is of frequent occurrence, and may be\r\nexpected to become more frequent when the sky is systematically explored\r\nfor them by the ingenious device suggested by Pickering and illustrated\r\nin Fig. 133. A given region of the sky--e. g., the Northern Crown--is\r\nphotographed repeatedly upon the same plate, which is shifted a little\r\nat each new exposure, so that the stars shall fall at new places upon\r\nit. The finally developed plate shows a row of images corresponding to\r\neach star, and if the star's light is constant the images in any given\r\nrow will all be of the same size, as are most of those in Fig. 133; but\r\na variable star such as is shown by the arrowhead reveals its presence\r\nby the broken aspect of its row of dots, a minimum brilliancy being\r\nshown by smaller and a maximum by larger ones. In this particular case,\r\nat two exposures the star was too faint to print its image upon the\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--Discovery of a variable star by means of\r\nphotography.--PICKERING.]\r\n\r\n208. NEW STARS.--Next to the variable stars of very long or very\r\nirregular period stand the so-called _new_ or _temporary stars_, which\r\nappear for the most part suddenly, and after a brief time either vanish\r\naltogether or sink to comparative insignificance. These were formerly\r\nthought to be very remarkable and unusual occurrences--\"the birth of a\r\nnew world\"--and it is noteworthy that no new star is recorded to have\r\nbeen seen from 1670 to 1848 A. D., for since that time there have been\r\nno less than five of them visible to the naked eye and others\r\ntelescopic. In so far as these new stars are not ordinary variables\r\n(Mira, first seen in 1596, was long counted as a new star), they are\r\ncommonly supposed due to chance encounters between stars or other cosmic\r\nbodies moving with considerable velocities along orbits which approach\r\nvery close to each other. The actual collision of two dark bodies moving\r\nwith high velocities is clearly sufficient to produce a luminous\r\nstar--e. g., meteors--and even the close approach of two cooled-off\r\nstars, might result in tidal actions which would rend open their crusts\r\nand pour out the glowing matter from within so as to produce temporarily\r\na very great accession of brightness.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all new stars is that which, according to Tycho\r\nBrahe's report, appeared in the year 1572, and was so bright when at its\r\nbest as to be seen with the naked eye in broad daylight. It continued\r\nvisible, though with fading light, for about 16 months, and finally\r\ndisappeared to the naked eye, although there is some reason to suppose\r\nthat it can be identified with a ruddy star of the eleventh magnitude in\r\nthe constellation Cassiopeia, whose light still shows traces of\r\nvariability.\r\n\r\nNo modern temporary star approaches that of Tycho in splendor, but in\r\nsome respects the recent ones surpass it in interest, since it has been\r\npossible to apply the spectroscope to the analysis of their light and to\r\nfind thereby a much more complex set of conditions in the star than\r\nwould have been suspected from its light changes alone.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary of new stars, and the most brilliant one\r\nsince that of Tycho, appeared suddenly in the constellation Perseus in\r\nFebruary, 1901, and for a short time equaled Capella in brightness. But\r\nits light rapidly waned, with periodic fluctuations of brightness like\r\nthose of a variable star, and at the present time (September, 1902) it\r\nis lost to the naked eye, although in the telescope it still shines like\r\na star of the ninth or tenth magnitude.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of powerful photographic apparatus, during the period of its\r\nwaning brilliancy a ring of faint nebulous matter was detected\r\nsurrounding the star and drifting around and away from it much as if a\r\nseries of nebulæ had been thrown off by the star at the time of its\r\nsudden outburst of light. But the extraordinary velocity of this nebular\r\nmotion, nearly a billion miles per hour, makes such an explanation\r\nalmost incredible, and astronomers are more inclined to believe that the\r\nring was merely a reflection of the star's own light from a cloud of\r\nmeteoric matter, into which a rapidly moving dark star plunged and,\r\nafter the fashion of terrestrial meteors, was raised to brilliant\r\nincandescence by the collision. If we assume this to be the true\r\nexplanation of these extraordinary phenomena, it is possible to show\r\nfrom the known velocity with which light travels through space and from\r\nthe rate at which the nebula spread, that the distance of Nova Persei,\r\nas the new star is called, corresponds to a parallax of about one\r\none-hundredth of a second, a result that is, in substance, confirmed by\r\ndirect telescopic measurements of its parallax.\r\n\r\nAnother modern temporary star is Nova Aurigæ, which appeared suddenly in\r\nDecember, 1891, waned, and in the following April vanished, only to\r\nreappear three months later for another season of renewed brightness.\r\nThe spectra of both these modern Novæ contain both dark and bright lines\r\ndisplaced toward opposite ends of the spectrum, and suggesting the\r\nDoppler effect that would be produced by two or more glowing bodies\r\nhaving rapid and opposite motions in the line of sight. But the most\r\nrecent investigations cast discredit on this explanation and leave the\r\nspectra of temporary stars still a subject of debate among astronomers,\r\nwith respect both to the motion they indicate and the intrinsic nature\r\nof the stars themselves. The varying aspect of the spectra suggested at\r\none time the sun's chromosphere, at another time the conditions that are\r\npresent in nebulæ, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSTARS AND NEBULÆ\r\n\r\n\r\n209. STELLAR COLORS.--We have already seen that one star differs from\r\nanother in respect of color as well as brightness, and the diligent\r\nstudent of the sky will not fail to observe for himself how the luster\r\nof Sirius and Rigel is more nearly a pure white than is that of any\r\nother stars in the heavens, while at the other end of the scale\r\n[a] Orionis and Aldebaran are strongly ruddy, and Antares presents an\r\neven deeper tone of red. Between these extremes the light of every star\r\nshows a mixture of the rainbow hues, in which a very pale yellow is the\r\npredominant color, shading off, as we have seen, to white at one end of\r\nthe scale and red at the other. There are no green stars, or blue stars,\r\nor violet stars, save in one exceptional class of cases--viz., where the\r\ntwo components of a double star are of very different brightness, it is\r\nquite the usual thing for them to have different colors, and then,\r\nalmost without exception, the color of the fainter star lies nearer to\r\nthe violet end of the spectrum than does the color of the bright one,\r\nand sometimes shows a distinctly blue or green hue. A fine type of such\r\ndouble star is [b] Cygni, in which the components are respectively\r\nyellow and blue, and the yellow star furnishes eight times as much light\r\nas the blue one.\r\n\r\nThe exception which double stars thus make to the general rule of\r\nstellar colors, yellow and red, but no color of shorter wave length, has\r\nnever been satisfactorily explained, but the rule itself presents no\r\ndifficulties. Each star is an incandescent body, giving off radiant\r\nenergy of every wave length within the limits of the visible spectrum,\r\nand, indeed, far beyond these limits. If this radiant energy could come\r\nunhindered to our eyes every star would appear white, but they are all\r\nsurrounded by atmospheres--analogous to the chromosphere and reversing\r\nlayer of the sun--which absorb a portion of their radiant energy and,\r\nlike the earth's atmosphere, take a heavier toll from the violet than\r\nfrom the red end of the spectrum. The greater the absorption in the\r\nstar's atmosphere, therefore, the feebler and the ruddier will be its\r\nlight, and corresponding to this the red stars are as a class fainter\r\nthan the white ones.\r\n\r\n210. CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS.--The spectroscope is pre-eminently the\r\ninstrument to deal with this absorption of light in the stellar\r\natmospheres, just as it deals with that absorption in the sun's\r\natmosphere to which are due the dark lines of the solar spectrum,\r\nalthough the faintness of starlight, compared with that of the sun,\r\npresents a serious obstacle to its use. Despite this difficulty most of\r\nthe lucid stars and many of the telescopic ones have been studied with\r\nthe spectroscope and found to be similar to the sun and the earth as\r\nrespects the material of which they are made. Such familiar chemical\r\nelements as hydrogen and iron, carbon, sodium, and calcium are scattered\r\nbroadcast throughout the visible universe, and while it would be\r\nunwarranted by the present state of knowledge to say that the stars\r\ncontain nothing not found in the earth and the sun, it is evident that\r\nin a broad way their substance is like rather than unlike that composing\r\nthe solar system, and is subject to the same physical and chemical laws\r\nwhich obtain here. Galileo and Newton extended to the heavens the\r\nterrestrial sciences of mathematics and mechanics, but it remained to\r\nthe nineteenth century to show that the physics and chemistry of the sky\r\nare like the physics and chemistry of the earth.\r\n\r\n211. STELLAR SPECTRA.--When the spectra of great numbers of stars are\r\ncompared one with another, it is found that they bear some relation to\r\nthe colors of the stars, as, indeed, we should expect, since spectrum\r\nand color are both produced by the stellar atmospheres, and it is found\r\nuseful to classify these spectra into three types, as follows:\r\n\r\n_Type I. Sirian stars._--Speaking generally, the stars which are white\r\nor very faintly tinged with yellow, furnish spectra like that of Sirius,\r\nfrom which they take their name, or that of [b] Aurigæ (Fig. 124), which\r\nis a continuous spectrum, especially rich in energy of short wave\r\nlength--i. e., violet and ultraviolet light, and is crossed by a\r\nrelatively small number of heavy dark lines corresponding to the\r\nspectrum of hydrogen. Sometimes, however, these lines are much fainter\r\nthan is here shown, and we find associated with them still other faint\r\nones pointing to the presence of other metallic substances in the star's\r\natmosphere. These metallic lines are not always present, and sometimes\r\neven the hydrogen lines themselves are lacking, but the spectrum is\r\nalways rich in violet and ultraviolet light.\r\n\r\nSince with increasing temperature a body emits a continually increasing\r\nproportion of energy of short wave length (§ 118), the richness of these\r\nspectra in such energy points to a very high temperature in these stars,\r\nprobably surpassing in some considerable measure that of the sun. Stars\r\nwith this type of spectrum are more numerous than all others combined,\r\nbut next to them in point of numbers stands--\r\n\r\n_Type II. Solar stars._--To this type of spectrum belong the yellow\r\nstars, which show spectra like that of the sun, or of Pollux (Fig. 125).\r\nThese are not so rich in violet light as are those of Type I, but in\r\ncomplexity of spectrum and in the number of their absorption lines they\r\nfar surpass the Sirian stars. They are supposed to be at a lower\r\ntemperature than the Sirian stars, and a much larger number of chemical\r\nelements seems present and active in the reversing layer of their\r\natmospheres. The strong resemblance which these spectra bear to that of\r\nthe sun, together with the fact that most of the sun's stellar neighbors\r\nhave spectra of this type, justify us in ranking both them and it as\r\nmembers of one class, called _solar stars_.\r\n\r\n_Type III. Red stars._--A small number of stars show spectra comparable\r\nwith that of [a] Herculis (Fig. 134), in which the blue and the violet\r\npart of the spectrum is almost obliterated, and the remaining yellow and\r\nred parts show not only dark lines, but also numerous broad dark bands,\r\nsharp at one edge, and gradually fading out at the other. It is this\r\n_selective absorption_, extinguishing the blue and leaving the red end\r\nof the spectrum, which produces the ruddy color of these stars, while\r\nthe bands in their spectra \"are characteristic of chemical combinations,\r\nand their presence ... proves that at certain elevations in the\r\natmospheres of these stars the temperature has sunk so low that chemical\r\ncombinations can be formed and maintained\" (Scheiner-Frost). One of the\r\nchemical compounds here indicated is a hydrocarbon similar to that found\r\nin comets. In the white and yellow stars the temperatures are so high\r\nthat the same chemical elements, although present, can not unite one\r\nwith another to form compound substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--The spectrum of [a] Herculis.--ESPIN.]\r\n\r\nMost of the variable stars are red and have spectra of the third type;\r\nbut this does not hold true for the eclipse variables like Algol, all of\r\nwhich are white stars with spectra of the first type. The ordinary\r\nvariable star is therefore one with a dense atmosphere of relatively low\r\ntemperature and complex structure, which produces the prevailing red\r\ncolor of these stars by absorbing the major part of their radiant\r\nenergy of short wave length while allowing the longer, red waves to\r\nescape. Although their exact nature is not understood, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the fluctuation in the light of these stars is due to\r\nprocesses taking place within the star itself, but whether above or\r\nbelow its photosphere is still uncertain.\r\n\r\n212. CLASSES OF STARS.--There is no hard-and-fast dividing line between\r\nthese types of stellar spectra, but the change from one to another is by\r\ninsensible gradations, like the transition from youth to manhood and\r\nfrom manhood to old age, and along the line of transition are to be\r\nfound numberless peculiarities and varieties of spectra not enumerated\r\nabove--e. g., a few stars show not only dark absorption lines in their\r\nspectra but bright lines as well, which, like those in Fig. 48, point to\r\nthe presence of incandescent vapors, even in the outer parts of their\r\natmospheres. Among the lucid stars about 75 per cent have spectra of the\r\nfirst type, 23 per cent are of the second type, 1 per cent of the third\r\ntype, and the remaining 1 per cent are peculiar or of doubtful\r\nclassification. Among the telescopic stars it is probable that much the\r\nsame distribution holds, but in the present state of knowledge it is not\r\nprudent to speak with entire confidence upon this point.\r\n\r\nThat the great number of stars whose spectra have been studied should\r\nadmit of a classification so simple as the above, is an impressive fact\r\nwhich, when supplemented by the further fact of a gradual transition\r\nfrom one type of spectrum to the next, leaves little room for doubt that\r\nin the stars we have an innumerable throng of individuals belonging to\r\nthe same species but in different stages of development, and that the\r\nsun is only one of these individuals, of something less than medium size\r\nand in a stage of development which is not at all peculiar, since it is\r\nshared by nearly a fourth of all the stars.\r\n\r\n213. STAR CLUSTERS.--In previous chapters we have noted the Pleiades and\r\nPræsepe as star clusters visible to the naked eye, and to them we may\r\nadd the Hyades, near Aldebaran, and the little constellation Coma\r\nBerenices. But more impressive than any of these, although visible only\r\nin a telescope, is the splendid cluster in Hercules, whose appearance in\r\na telescope of moderate size is shown in Fig. 135, while Fig. 136 is a\r\nphotograph of the same cluster taken with a very large reflecting\r\ntelescope. This is only a type of many telescopic clusters which are\r\nscattered over the sky, and which are made up of stars packed so closely\r\ntogether as to become indistinguishable, one from another, at the center\r\nof the cluster. Within an area which could be covered by a third of the\r\nfull moon's face are crowded in this cluster more than five thousand\r\nstars which are unquestionably close neighbors, but whose apparent\r\nnearness to each other is doubtless due to their great distance from us.\r\nIt is quite probable that even at the center of this cluster, where more\r\nthan a thousand stars are included within a radius of 160\", the actual\r\ndistances separating adjoining stars are much greater than that\r\nseparating earth and sun, but far less than that separating the sun from\r\nits nearest stellar neighbor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 135.--Star cluster in Hercules.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting discovery of recent date, made by Professor Bailey in\r\nphotographing star clusters, is that some few of them, which are\r\nespecially rich in stars, contain an extraordinary number of variable\r\nstars, mostly very faint and of short period. Two clusters, one in the\r\nnorthern and one in the southern hemisphere, contain each more than a\r\nhundred variables, and an even more extraordinary case is presented by\r\na cluster, called Messier 5, not far from the star [a] Serpentis,\r\nwhich contains no less than sixty-three variables, all about of the\r\nfourteenth magnitude, all having light periods which differ but little\r\nfrom half a day, all having light curves of about the same shape, and\r\nall having a range of brightness from maximum to minimum of about one\r\nmagnitude. An extraordinary set of coincidences which \"points\r\nunmistakably to a common origin and cause of variability.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Star cluster in Hercules.--KEELER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--The Andromeda nebula as seen in a very small\r\ntelescope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--The Andromeda nebula and Holmes's comet.\r\nPhotographed by BARNARD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--A drawing of the Andromeda nebula.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--A photograph of the Andromeda\r\nnebula.--ROBERTS.]\r\n\r\n214. NEBULÆ.--Returning to Fig. 136, we note that its background has a\r\nhazy appearance, and that at its center the stars can no longer be\r\ndistinguished, but blend one with another so as to appear like a bright\r\ncloud. The outer part of the cluster is _resolved_ into stars, while in\r\nthe picture the inner portion is not so resolved, although in the\r\noriginal photographic plate the individual stars can be distinguished to\r\nthe very center of the cluster. In many cases, however, this is not\r\npossible, and we have an _irresolvable cluster_ which it is customary to\r\ncall a _nebula_ (Latin, _little cloud_).\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous example of this in the northern heavens is the\r\ngreat nebula in Andromeda (R. A. 0^{h} 37^{m}, Dec. + 41°), which may be\r\nseen with the naked eye as a faint patch of foggy light. Look for it.\r\nThis appears in an opera glass or very small telescope not unlike Fig.\r\n137, which is reproduced from a sketch. Fig. 138 is from a photograph of\r\nthe same object showing essentially the same shape as in the preceding\r\nfigure, but bringing out more detail. Note the two small nebulæ\r\nadjoining the large one, and at the bottom of the picture an object\r\nwhich might easily be taken for another nebula but which is in fact a\r\ntailless comet that chanced to be passing that part of the sky when the\r\npicture was taken. Fig. 139 is from another drawing of this nebula,\r\nalthough it is hardly to be recognized as a representation of the same\r\nthing; but its characteristic feature, the two dark streaks near the\r\ncenter of the picture, is justified in part by Fig. 140, which is from a\r\nphotograph made with a large reflecting telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Types of nebulæ.]\r\n\r\nA comparison of these several representations of the same thing will\r\nserve to illustrate the vagueness of its outlines, and how much the\r\nimpressions to be derived from nebulæ depend upon the telescopes\r\nemployed and upon the observer's own prepossessions. The differences\r\namong the pictures can not be due to any change in the nebula itself,\r\nfor half a century ago it was sketched much as shown in the latest of\r\nthem (Fig. 140).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--The Trifid nebula.--KEELER.]\r\n\r\n215. TYPICAL NEBULÆ.--Some of the fantastic forms which nebulæ present\r\nin the telescope are shown on a small scale in Fig. 141, but in recent\r\nyears astronomers have learned to place little reliance upon drawings\r\nsuch as these, which are now almost entirely supplanted by photographs\r\nmade with long exposures in powerful telescopes. One of the most\r\nexquisite of these modern photographs is that of the Trifid nebula in\r\nSagittarius (Fig. 142). Note especially the dark lanes that give to this\r\nnebula its name, Trifid, and which run through its brightest parts,\r\nbreaking it into seemingly independent sections. The area of the sky\r\nshown in this cut is about 15 per cent less than that covered by the\r\nfull moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--A nebula in Cygnus.--KEELER.]\r\n\r\nFig. 143 shows a very different type of nebula, found in the\r\nconstellation Cygnus, which appears made up of filaments closely\r\nintertwined, and stretches across the sky for a distance considerably\r\ngreater than the moon's diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--Spiral nebula in Canes Venatici.--KEELER.]\r\n\r\nA much smaller but equally striking nebula is that in the constellation\r\nCanes Venatici (Fig. 144), which shows a most extraordinary spiral\r\nstructure, as if the stars composing it were flowing in along curved\r\nlines toward a center of condensation. The diameter of the circular part\r\nof this nebula, omitting the projection toward the bottom of the\r\npicture, is about five minutes of arc, a sixth part of the diameter of\r\nthe moon, and its thickness is probably very small compared with its\r\nbreadth, perhaps not much exceeding the width of the spiral streams\r\nwhich compose it. Note how the bright stars that appear within the area\r\nof this nebula fall on the streams of nebulous matter as if they were\r\npart of them. This characteristic grouping of the stars, which is\r\nfollowed in many other nebulæ, shows that they are really part and\r\nparcel of the nebula and not merely on line with it. Fig. 145 shows how\r\na great nebula is associated with the star [r] Ophiuchi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--Great nebula about the star [r]\r\nOphiuchi.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\nProbably the most impressive of all nebulæ is the great one in Orion\r\n(Fig. 146), whose position is shown on the star map between Rigel and\r\n[z] Orionis. Look for it with an opera glass or even with the unaided\r\neye. This is sometimes called an _amorphous_--i. e., shapeless--nebula,\r\nbecause it presents no definite form which the eye can grasp and little\r\ntrace of structure or organization. It is \"without form and void\" at\r\nleast in its central portions, although on its edges curved filaments\r\nmay be traced streaming away from the brighter parts of the central\r\nregion. This nebula, as shown in Fig. 146, covers an area about equal\r\nto that of the full moon, without counting as any part of this the\r\ncompanion nebula shown at one side, but photographs made with suitable\r\nexposures show that faint outlying parts of the nebula extend in curved\r\nlines over the larger part of the constellation Orion. Indeed, over a\r\nlarge part of the entire sky the background is faintly covered with\r\nnebulous light whose brighter portions, if each were counted as a\r\nseparate nebula, would carry the total number of such objects well into\r\nthe hundreds of thousands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--The Orion nebula.]\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades (Plate IV) present a case of a resolvable star cluster\r\nprojected against such a nebulous background whose varying intensity\r\nshould be noted in the figure. A part of this nebulous matter is shown\r\nin wisps extending from one star to the next, after the fashion of a\r\nbridge, and leaving little doubt that the nebula is actually a part of\r\nthe cluster and not merely a background for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PLEIADES (AFTER A PHOTOGRAPH)]\r\n\r\nFig. 147 shows a series of so-called double nebulæ perhaps comparable\r\nwith double stars, although the most recent photographic work seems to\r\nindicate that they are really faint spiral nebulæ in which only the\r\nbrightest parts are shown by the telescope.\r\n\r\nAccording to Keeler, the spiral is the prevailing type of nebulæ, and\r\nwhile Fig. 144 presents the most perfect example of such a nebula, the\r\nstudent should not fail to note that the Andromeda nebula (Fig. 140)\r\nshows distinct traces of a spiral structure, only here we do not see its\r\ntrue shape, the nebula being turned nearly edgewise toward us so that\r\nits presumably circular outline is foreshortened into a narrow ellipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--Double nebulæ. HERSCHEL.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of nebula of some consequence presents in the telescope\r\nround disks like those of Uranus or Neptune, and this appearance has\r\ngiven them the name _planetary nebulæ_. The comet in Fig. 138, if\r\nsmaller, would represent fairly well the nebulæ of this type. Sometimes\r\na planetary nebula has a star at its center, and sometimes it appears\r\nhollow, like a smoke ring, and is then called a ring nebula. The most\r\nfamous of these is in the constellation Lyra, not far from Vega.\r\n\r\n216. SPECTRA OF NEBULÆ.--A star cluster, like the one in Hercules,\r\nshows, of course, stellar spectra, and even when irresolvable the\r\nspectrum is a continuous one, testifying to the presence of stars,\r\nalthough they stand too close together to be separately seen. But in a\r\ncertain number of nebulæ the spectrum is altogether different, a\r\ndiscontinuous one containing only a few bright lines, showing that here\r\nthe nebular light comes from glowing gases which are subject to no\r\nconsiderable pressure. The planetary nebulæ all have spectra of this\r\nkind and make up about half of all the known gaseous nebulæ. It is\r\nworthy of note that a century ago Sir William Herschel had observed a\r\ngreen shimmer in the light of certain nebulæ which led him to believe\r\nthat they were \"not of a starry nature,\" a conclusion which has been\r\nabundantly confirmed by the spectroscope. The green shimmer is, in fact,\r\ncaused by a line in the green part of the spectrum that is always\r\npresent and is always the brightest part of the spectrum of gaseous\r\nnebulæ.\r\n\r\nIn faint nebulæ this line constitutes the whole of their visible\r\nspectrum, but in brighter ones two or three other and fainter lines are\r\nusually associated with it, and a very bright nebula, like that in\r\nOrion, may show a considerable number of extra lines, but for the most\r\npart they can not be identified in the spectrum of any terrestrial\r\nsubstances. An exception to this is found in the hydrogen lines, which\r\nare well marked in most spectra of gaseous nebulæ, and there are\r\nindications of one or two other known substances.\r\n\r\n217. DENSITY OF NEBULÆ.--It is known from laboratory experiments that\r\ndiminishing the pressure to which an incandescent gas is subject,\r\ndiminishes the number of lines contained in its spectrum, and we may\r\nsurmise from the very simple character and few lines of these nebular\r\nspectra that the gas which produces them has a very small density. But\r\nthis is far from showing that the nebula itself is correspondingly\r\nattenuated, for we must not assume that this shining gas is all that\r\nexists in the nebula; so far as telescope or camera are concerned, there\r\nmay be associated with it any amount of dark matter which can not be\r\nseen because it sends to us no light. It is easy to think in this\r\nconnection of meteoric dust or the stuff of which comets are made, for\r\nthese seem to be scattered broadcast on every side of the solar system\r\nand may, perchance, extend out to the region of the nebulæ.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever may be associated in the nebula with the glowing gas which\r\nwe see, the total amount of matter, invisible as well as visible, must\r\nbe very small, or rather its average density must be very small, for the\r\nspace occupied by such a nebula as that of Orion is so great that if the\r\naverage density of its matter were equal to that of air the resulting\r\nmass by its attraction would exert a sensible effect upon the motion of\r\nthe sun through space. The brighter parts of this nebula as seen from\r\nthe earth subtend an angle of about half a degree, and while we know\r\nnothing of its distance from us, it is easy to see that the farther it\r\nis away the greater must be its real dimensions, and that this increase\r\nof bulk and mass with increasing distance will just compensate the\r\ndiminishing intensity of gravity at great distances, so that for a given\r\nangular diameter--e. g., half a degree--the force with which this nebula\r\nattracts the sun depends upon its density but not at all upon its\r\ndistance. Now, the nebula must attract the sun in some degree, and must\r\ntend to move it and the planets in an orbit about the attracting center\r\nso that year after year we should see the nebula from slightly different\r\npoints of view, and this changed point of view should produce a change\r\nin the apparent direction of the nebula from us--i. e., a proper motion,\r\nwhose amount would depend upon the attracting force, and therefore upon\r\nthe density of the attracting matter. Observations of the Orion nebula\r\nshow that its proper motion is wholly inappreciable, certainly far less\r\nthan half a second of arc per year, and corresponding to this amount of\r\nproper motion the mean density of the nebula must be some millions of\r\ntimes (10^{10} according to Ranyard) less than that of air at sea\r\nlevel--i. e., the average density throughout the nebula is comparable\r\nwith that of those upper parts of the earth's atmosphere in which\r\nmeteors first become visible.\r\n\r\n218. MOTION OF NEBULÆ.--The extreme minuteness of their proper motions\r\nis a characteristic feature of all nebulæ. Indeed, there is hardly a\r\nknown case of sensible proper motion of one of these bodies, although a\r\ndozen or more of them show velocities in the line of sight ranging in\r\namount from +30 to -40 miles per second, the plus sign indicating an\r\nincreasing distance. While a part of these velocities may be only\r\napparent and due to the motion of earth and sun through space, a part at\r\nleast is real motion of the nebulæ themselves. These seem to move\r\nthrough the celestial spaces in much the same way and with the same\r\nvelocities as do the stars, and their smaller proper motions across the\r\nline of sight (angular motions) are an index of their great distance\r\nfrom us. No one has ever succeeded in measuring the parallax of a nebula\r\nor star cluster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.--A part of the Milky Way.]\r\n\r\nThe law of gravitation presumably holds sway within these bodies, and\r\nthe fact that their several parts and the stars which are involved\r\nwithin them, although attracted by each other, have shown little or no\r\nchange of position during the past century, is further evidence of\r\ntheir low density and feeble attraction. In a few cases, however, there\r\nseem to be in progress within a nebula changes of brightness, so that\r\nwhat was formerly a faint part has become a brighter one, or _vice\r\nversa_; but, on the whole, even these changes are very small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--The Milky Way near [th] Ophiuchi.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\n219. THE MILKY WAY.--Closely related to nebulæ and star clusters is\r\nanother feature of the sky, the _galaxy_ or _Milky Way_, with whose\r\nappearance to the unaided eye the student should become familiar by\r\ndirect study of the thing itself. Figs. 148 and 149 are from photographs\r\nof two small parts of it, and serve to bring out the small stars of\r\nwhich it is composed. Every star shown in these pictures is invisible to\r\nthe naked eye, although their combined light is easily seen. The general\r\ncourse of the galaxy across the heavens is shown in the star maps, but\r\nthese contain no indication of the wealth of detail which even the naked\r\neye may detect in it. Bright and faint parts, dark rifts which cut it\r\ninto segments, here and there a hole as if the ribbon of light had been\r\nshot away--such are some of the features to be found by attentive\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.--The Milky Way near [b] Cygni.--BARNARD.]\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the course of the Milky Way is a great circle\r\ncompletely girdling the sky and having its north pole in the\r\nconstellation Coma Berenices. The width of this stream of light is very\r\ndifferent in different parts of the heavens, amounting where it is\r\nwidest, in Lyra and Cygnus, to something more than 30°, although its\r\nboundaries are too vague and ill defined to permit much accuracy of\r\nmeasurement. Observe the very bright part between [b] and [g] Cygni,\r\nnearly opposite Vega, and note how even an opera glass will partially\r\nresolve the nebulous light into a great number of stars, which are here\r\nrather brighter than in other parts of its course. But the resolution\r\ninto stars is only partial, and there still remains a background of\r\nunresolved shimmer. Fig. 150 is a photograph of a small part of this\r\nregion in which, although each fleck of light represents a separate\r\nstar, the galaxy is not completely resolved. Compare with this region,\r\nrich in stars, the nearly empty space between the branches of the galaxy\r\na little west of Altair. Another hole in the Milky Way may be found a\r\nlittle north and east of [a] Cygni, and between the extremes of\r\nabundance and poverty here noted there may be found every gradation of\r\nnebulous light.\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way is not so simple in its structure as might at first be\r\nthought, but a clear and moonless night is required to bring out its\r\ndetails. The nature of these details, the structure of the galaxy, its\r\nshape and extent, the arrangement of its parts, and their relation to\r\nstars and nebulæ in general, have been subjects of much speculation by\r\nastronomers and others who have sought to trace out in this way what is\r\ncalled the _construction of the heavens_.\r\n\r\n220. DISTRIBUTION OF THE STARS.--How far out into space do the stars\r\nextend? Are they limited or infinite in number? Do they form a system of\r\nmutually related parts, or are they bunched promiscuously, each for\r\nitself, without reference to the others? Here is what has been well\r\ncalled \"the most important problem of stellar astronomy, the acquisition\r\nof well-founded ideas about the distribution of the stars.\" While many\r\nof the ideas upon this subject which have been advanced by eminent\r\nastronomers and which are still current in the books are certainly\r\nwrong, and few of their speculations along this line are demonstrably\r\ntrue, the theme itself is of such grandeur and permanent interest as to\r\ndemand at least a brief consideration. But before proceeding to its\r\nspeculative side we need to collect facts upon which to build, and\r\nthese, however inadequate, are in the main simple and not far to seek.\r\n\r\nParallaxes, proper motions, motions in the line of sight, while\r\npertinent to the problem of stellar distribution, are of small avail,\r\nsince they are far too scanty in number and relate only to limited\r\nclasses of stars, usually the very bright ones or those nearest to the\r\nsun. Almost the sole available data are contained in the brightness of\r\nthe stars and the way in which they seem scattered in the sky. The most\r\ncasual survey of the heavens is enough to show that the stars are not\r\nevenly sprinkled upon it. The lucid stars are abundant in some regions,\r\nfew in others, and the laborious star gauges, actual counting of the\r\nstars in sample regions of the sky, which have been made by the\r\nHerschels, Celoria, and others, suffice to show that this lack of\r\nuniformity in distribution is even more markedly true of the telescopic\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nThe rate of increase in the number of stars from one magnitude to the\r\nnext, as shown in § 187, is proof of another kind of irregularity in\r\ntheir distribution. It is not difficult to show, mathematically, that if\r\nin distant regions of space the stars were on the average as numerous\r\nand as bright as they are in the regions nearer to the sun, then the\r\nstars of any particular magnitude ought to be four times as numerous as\r\nthose of the next brighter magnitude--e. g., four times as many\r\nsixth-magnitude stars as there are fifth-magnitude ones. But, as we have\r\nalready seen in § 187, by actual count there are only three times as\r\nmany, and from the discrepancy between these numbers, an actual\r\nthreefold increase instead of a fourfold one, we must conclude that on\r\nthe whole the stars near the sun are either bigger or brighter or more\r\nnumerous than in the remoter depths of space.\r\n\r\n221. THE STELLAR SYSTEM.--But the arrangement of the stars is not\r\naltogether lawless and chaotic; there are traces of order and system,\r\nand among these the Milky Way is the dominant feature. Telescope and\r\nphotographic plate alike show that it is made up of stars which,\r\nalthough quite irregularly scattered along its course, are on the\r\naverage some twenty times as numerous in the galaxy as at its poles,\r\nand which thin out as we recede from it on either side, at first rapidly\r\nand then more slowly. This tendency to cluster along the Milky Way is\r\nmuch more pronounced among the very faint telescopic stars than among\r\nthe brighter ones, for the lucid stars and the telescopic ones down to\r\nthe tenth or eleventh magnitude, while very plainly showing the\r\nclustering tendency, are not more than three times as numerous in the\r\ngalaxy as in the constellations most remote from it. It is remarkable as\r\nshowing the condensation of the brightest stars that one half of all the\r\nstars in the sky which are brighter than the second magnitude are\r\nincluded within a belt extending 12° on either side of the center line\r\nof the galaxy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this general condensation of stars toward the Milky Way,\r\nthere are peculiarities in the distribution of certain classes of stars\r\nwhich are worth attention. Planetary nebulæ and new stars are seldom, if\r\never, found far from the Milky Way, and stars with bright lines in their\r\nspectra especially affect this region of the sky. Stars with spectra of\r\nthe first type--Sirian stars--are much more strongly condensed toward\r\nthe Milky Way than are stars of the solar type, and in consequence of\r\nthis the Milky Way is peculiarly rich in light of short wave lengths.\r\nResolvable star clusters are so much more numerous in the galaxy than\r\nelsewhere, that its course across the sky would be plainly indicated by\r\ntheir grouping upon a map showing nothing but clusters of this kind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, nebulæ as a class show a distinct aversion for the\r\ngalaxy, and are found most abundantly in those parts of the sky farthest\r\nfrom it, much as if they represented raw material which was lacking\r\nalong the Milky Way, because already worked up to make the stars which\r\nare there so numerous.\r\n\r\n222. RELATION OF THE SUN TO THE MILKY WAY.--The fact that the galaxy is\r\na _great circle_ of the sky, but only of moderate width, shows that it\r\nis a widely extended and comparatively thin stratum of stars within\r\nwhich the solar system lies, a member of the galactic system, and\r\nprobably not very far from its center. This position, however, is not to\r\nbe looked upon as a permanent one, since the sun's motion, which lies\r\nnearly in the plane of the Milky Way, is ceaselessly altering its\r\nrelation to the center of that system, and may ultimately carry us\r\noutside its limits.\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way itself is commonly thought to be a ring, or series of\r\nrings, like the coils of the great spiral nebula in Andromeda, and\r\nseparated from us by a space far greater than the thickness of the ring\r\nitself. Note in Figs. 149 and 150 how the background is made up of\r\nbright and dark parts curiously interlaced, and presenting much the\r\nappearance of a thin sheet of cloud through which we look to barren\r\nspace beyond. While, mathematically, this appearance can not be\r\nconsidered as proof that the galaxy is in fact a distant ring, rather\r\nthan a sheet of starry matter stretching continuously from the nearer\r\nstellar neighbors of the sun into the remotest depths of space,\r\nnevertheless, most students of the question hold it to be such a ring of\r\nstars, which are relatively close together while its center is\r\ncomparatively vacant, although even here are some hundreds of thousands\r\nof stars which on the whole have a tendency to cluster near its plane\r\nand to crowd together a little more densely than elsewhere in the region\r\nwhere the sun is placed.\r\n\r\n223. DIMENSIONS OF THE GALAXY.--The dimensions of this stellar system\r\nare wholly unknown, but there can be no doubt that it extends farther in\r\nthe plane of the Milky Way than at right angles to that plane, for stars\r\nof the fifteenth and sixteenth magnitudes are common in the galaxy, and\r\ntestify by their feeble light to their great distance from the earth,\r\nwhile near the poles of the Milky Way there seem to be few stars fainter\r\nthan the twelfth magnitude. Herschel, with his telescope of 18 inches\r\naperture, could count in the Milky Way more than a dozen times as many\r\nstars per square degree as could Celoria with a telescope of 4 inches\r\naperture; but around the poles of the galaxy the two telescopes showed\r\npractically the same number of stars, indicating that here even the\r\nsmaller telescope reached to the limits of the stellar system. Very\r\nrecently, indeed, the telescope with which Fig. 140 was photographed\r\nseems to have reached the farthest limit of the Milky Way, for on a\r\nphotographic plate of one of its richest regions Roberts finds it\r\ncompletely resolved into stars which stand out upon a black background\r\nwith no trace of nebulous light between them.\r\n\r\n224. BEYOND THE MILKY WAY.--Each additional step into the depths of\r\nspace brings us into a region of which less is known, and what lies\r\nbeyond the Milky Way is largely a matter of conjecture. We shrink from\r\nthinking it an infinite void, endless emptiness, and our intellectual\r\nsympathies go out to Lambert's speculation of a universe filled with\r\nstellar systems, of which ours, bounded by the galaxy, is only one.\r\nThere is, indeed, little direct evidence that other such systems exist,\r\nbut the Andromeda nebula is not altogether unlike a galaxy with a\r\ncentral cloud of stars, and in the southern hemisphere, invisible in our\r\nlatitudes, are two remarkable stellar bodies like the Milky Way in\r\nappearance, but cut off from all apparent connection with it, much as we\r\nmight expect to find independent stellar systems, if such there be.\r\n\r\nThese two bodies are known as the Magellanic clouds, and individually\r\nbear the names of Major and Minor Nubecula. According to Sir John\r\nHerschel, \"the Nubecula Major, like the Minor, consists partly of large\r\ntracts and ill-defined patches of irresolvable nebula, and of nebulosity\r\nin every stage of resolution up to perfectly resolved stars like the\r\nMilky Way, as also of regular and irregular nebulæ ... of globular\r\nclusters in every stage of resolvability, and of clustering groups\r\nsufficiently insulated and condensed to come under the designation of\r\nclusters of stars.\" Its outlines are vague and somewhat uncertain, but\r\nsurely include an area of more than 40 square degrees--i. e., as much as\r\nthe bowl of the Big Dipper--and within this area Herschel counted\r\nseveral hundred nebulæ and clusters \"which far exceeds anything that is\r\nto be met with in any other region of the heavens.\" Although its\r\nexcessive complexity of detail baffled Herschel's attempts at artistic\r\ndelineation, it has yielded to the modern photographic processes, which\r\nshow the Nubecula Major to be an enormous spiral nebula made up of\r\nsubordinate stars, nebulæ, and clusters, as is the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nCompared with the Andromeda nebula, its greater angular extent suggests\r\na smaller distance, although for the present all efforts at determining\r\nthe parallax of either seem hopeless. But the spiral form which is\r\ncommon to both suggests that the Milky Way itself may be a gigantic\r\nspiral nebula near whose center lies the sun, a humble member of a great\r\ncluster of stars which is roughly globular in shape, but flattened at\r\nthe poles of the galaxy and completely encircled by its coils. However\r\nplausible such a view may appear, it is for the present, at least, pure\r\nhypothesis, although vigorously advocated by Easton, who bases his\r\nargument upon the appearance of the galaxy itself.\r\n\r\n225. ABSORPTION OF STARLIGHT.--We have had abundant occasion to learn\r\nthat at least within the confines of the solar system meteoric matter,\r\ncosmic dust, is profusely scattered, and it appears not improbable that\r\nthe same is true, although in smaller degree, in even the remoter parts\r\nof space. In this case the light which comes from the farther stars over\r\na path requiring many centuries to travel, must be in some measure\r\nabsorbed and enfeebled by the obstacles which it encounters on the way.\r\nUnless celestial space is transparent to an improbable degree the\r\nremoter stars do not show their true brightness; there is a certain\r\nlimit beyond which no star is able to send its light, and beyond which\r\nthe universe must be to us a blank. A lighthouse throws into the fog its\r\nbeams only to have them extinguished before a single mile is passed, and\r\nthough the celestial lights shine farther, a limit to their reach is\r\nnone the less certain if meteoric dust exists outside the solar system.\r\nIf there is such an absorption of light in space, as seems plausible,\r\nthe universe may well be limitless and the number of stellar systems\r\ninfinite, although the most attenuated of dust clouds suffices to\r\nconceal from us and to shut off from our investigation all save a minor\r\nfraction of it and them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nGROWTH AND DECAY\r\n\r\n\r\n226. NATURE OF THE PROBLEM.--To use a common figure of speech, the\r\nuniverse is alive. We have found it filled with an activity that\r\nmanifests itself not only in the motions of the heavenly bodies along\r\ntheir orbits, but which extends to their minutest parts, the molecules\r\nand atoms, whose vibrations furnish the radiant energy given off by sun\r\nand stars. Some of these activities, such as the motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies in their orbits, seem fitted to be of endless duration; while\r\nothers, like the radiation of light and heat, are surely temporary, and\r\nsooner or later must come to an end and be replaced by something\r\ndifferent. The study of things as they are thus leads inevitably to\r\nquestions of what has been and what is to be. A sound science should\r\nfurnish some account of the universe of yesterday and to-morrow as well\r\nas of to-day, and we need not shrink from such questions, although\r\nanswers to them must be vague and in great measure speculative.\r\n\r\nThe historian of America finds little difficulty with events of the\r\nnineteenth century or even the eighteenth, but the sources of\r\ninformation about America in the fifteenth century are much less\r\ndefinite; the tenth century presents almost a blank, and the history of\r\nAmerican mankind in the first century of the Christian era is wholly\r\nunknown. So, as we attempt to look into the past or the future of the\r\nheavens, we must expect to find the mists of obscurity grow denser with\r\nremoter periods until even the vaguest outlines of its development are\r\nlost, and we are compelled to say, beyond this lies the unknown. Our\r\naccount of growth and decay in the universe, therefore, can not aspire\r\nto cover the whole duration of things, but must be limited in its scope\r\nto certain chapters whose epochs lie near to the time in which we live,\r\nand even for these we need to bear constantly in mind the logical bases\r\nof such an inquiry and the limitations which they impose upon us.\r\n\r\n227. LOGICAL BASES AND LIMITATIONS.--The first of these bases is: An\r\nadequate knowledge of the present universe. Our only hope of reading the\r\npast and future lies in an understanding of the present; not necessarily\r\na complete knowledge of it, but one which is sound so far as it goes.\r\nOur position is like that of a detective who is called upon to unravel a\r\nmystery or crime, and who must commence with the traces that have been\r\nleft behind in its commission. The foot print, the blood stain, the\r\nbroken glass must be examined and compared, and fashioned into a theory\r\nof how they came to be; and as a wrong understanding of these elements\r\nis sure to vitiate the theories based upon them, so a false science of\r\nthe universe as it now is, will surely give a false account of what it\r\nhas been; while a correct but incomplete knowledge of the present does\r\nnot wholly bar an understanding of the past, but only puts us in the\r\nposition of the detective who correctly understands what he sees but\r\nfails to take note of other facts which might greatly aid him.\r\n\r\nThe second basis of our inquiry is: The assumed permanence of natural\r\nlaws. The law of gravitation certainly held true a century ago as well\r\nas a year ago, and for aught we know to the contrary it may have been a\r\nlaw of the universe for untold millions of years; but that it has\r\nprevailed for so long a time is a pure assumption, although a necessary\r\none for our purpose. So with those other laws of mathematics and\r\nmechanics and physics and chemistry to which we must appeal; if there\r\nwas ever a time or place in which they did not hold true, that time and\r\nplace lie beyond the scope of our inquiry, and are in the domain\r\ninaccessible to scientific research. It is for this reason that science\r\nknows nothing and can know nothing of a creation or an end of the\r\nuniverse, but considers only its orderly development within limited\r\nperiods of time. What kind of a past universe would, under the operation\r\nof known laws, develop into the present one, is the question with which\r\nwe have to deal, and of it we may say with Helmholtz: \"From the\r\nstandpoint of science this is no idle speculation but an inquiry\r\nconcerning the limitations of its methods and the scope of its known\r\nlaws.\"\r\n\r\nTo ferret out the processes by which the heavenly bodies have been\r\nbrought to their present condition we seek first of all for lines of\r\ndevelopment now in progress which tend to change the existing order of\r\nthings into something different, and, having found these, to trace their\r\neffects into both past and future. Any force, however small, or any\r\nprocess, however slow, may produce great results if it works always and\r\nceaselessly in the same direction, and it is in these processes, whose\r\ntrend is never reversed, that we find a partial clew to both past and\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n228. THE SUN'S DEVELOPMENT.--The first of these to claim our attention\r\nis the shrinking of the sun's diameter which, as we have seen in Chapter\r\nX, is the means by which the solar output of radiant energy is\r\nmaintained from year to year. Its amount, only a few feet per annum, is\r\nfar too small to be measured with any telescope; but it is cumulative,\r\nworking century after century in the same direction, and, given time\r\nenough, it will produce in the future, and must have produced in the\r\npast, enormous transformations in the sun's bulk and equally significant\r\nchanges in its physical condition.\r\n\r\nThus, as we attempt to trace the sun's history into the past, the\r\nfarther back we go the greater shall we expect to find its diameter and\r\nthe greater the space (volume) through which its molecules are spread.\r\nBy reason of this expansion its density must have been less then than\r\nnow, and by going far enough back we may even reach a time at which the\r\ndensity was comparable with what we find in the nebulæ of to-day. If our\r\nideas of the sun's present mechanism are sound, then, as a necessary\r\nconsequence of these, its past career must have been a process of\r\ncondensation in which its component particles were year by year packed\r\ncloser together by their own attraction for each other. As we have seen\r\nin § 126, this condensation necessarily developed heat, a part of which\r\nwas radiated away as fast as produced, while the remainder was stored\r\nup, and served to raise the temperature of the sun to what we find it\r\nnow. At the present time this temperature is a chief obstacle to further\r\nshrinkage, and so powerfully opposes the gravitative forces as to\r\nmaintain nearly an equilibrium with them, thus causing a very slow rate\r\nof further condensation. But it is not probable that this was always so.\r\nIn the early stages of the sun's history, when the temperature was low,\r\ncontraction of its bulk must have been more rapid, and attempts have\r\nbeen made by the mathematicians to measure its rate of progress and to\r\ndetermine how long a time has been consumed in the development of the\r\npresent sun from a primitive nebulous condition in which it filled a\r\nspace of greater diameter than Neptune's orbit. Of course, numerical\r\nprecision is not to be expected in results of this kind, but, from a\r\nconsideration of the greatest amount of heat that could be furnished by\r\nthe shrinkage of a mass equal to that of the sun, it seems that the\r\nperiod of this development is to be measured in tens of millions or\r\npossibly hundreds of millions of years, but almost certainly does not\r\nreach a thousand millions.\r\n\r\n229. THE SUN'S FUTURE.--The future duration of the sun as a source of\r\nradiant energy is surely to be measured in far smaller numbers than\r\nthese. Its career as a dispenser of light and heat is much more than\r\nhalf spent, for the shrinkage results in an ever-increasing density,\r\nwhich makes its gaseous substance approximate more and more toward the\r\nbehavior of a liquid or solid, and we recall that these forms of matter\r\ncan not by any further condensation restore the heat whose loss through\r\nradiation caused them to contract. They may continue to shrink, but\r\ntheir temperature must fall, and when the sun's substance becomes too\r\ndense to obey the laws of gaseous matter its surface must cool rapidly\r\nas a consequence of the radiation into surrounding space, and must\r\ncongeal into a crust which, although at first incandescent, will\r\nspeedily become dark and opaque, cutting off the light of the central\r\nportions, save as it may be rent from time to time by volcanic outbursts\r\nof the still incandescent mass beneath. But such outbursts can be of\r\nshort duration only, and its final condition must be that of a dark\r\nbody, like the earth or moon, no longer available as a source of radiant\r\nenergy. Even before the formation of a solid crust it is quite possible\r\nthat the output of light and heat may be seriously diminished by the\r\nformation of dense vapors completely enshrouding it, as is now the case\r\nwith Jupiter and Saturn. It is believed that these planets were formerly\r\nincandescent, and at the present time are in a state of development\r\nthrough which the earth has passed and toward which the sun is moving.\r\nAccording to Newcomb, the future during which the sun can continue to\r\nfurnish light and heat at its present rate is not likely to exceed\r\n10,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the sun as a developing body whose present state is only\r\ntemporary, furnishes a clew to some of the vexing problems of solar\r\nphysics. Thus the sun-spot period, the distribution of the spots in\r\nlatitude, and the peculiar law of rotation of the sun in different\r\nlatitudes, may be, and very probably are, results not of anything now\r\noperating beneath its photosphere, but of something which happened to it\r\nin the remote past--e. g., an unsymmetrical shrinkage or possibly a\r\ncollision with some other body. At sea the waves continue to toss long\r\nafter the storm which produced them has disappeared, and, according to\r\nthe mathematical researches of Wilsing, a profound agitation of the\r\nsun's mass might well require tens of thousands, or even hundreds of\r\nthousands of years to subside, and during this time its effects would be\r\nvisible, like the waves, as phenomena for which the actual condition of\r\nthings furnishes no apparent cause.\r\n\r\n230. THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.--The theory of the sun's progressive\r\ncontraction as a necessary result of its radiation of energy is\r\ncomparatively modern, but more than a century ago philosophic students\r\nof Nature had been led in quite a different way to the belief that in\r\nthe earlier stages of its career the sun must have been an enormously\r\nextended body whose outer portions reached even beyond the orbit of the\r\nremotest planet. Laplace, whose speculations upon this subject have had\r\na dominant influence during the nineteenth century, has left, in a\r\npopular treatise upon astronomy, an admirable statement of the phenomena\r\nof planetary motion, which suggest and lead up to the nebular theory of\r\nthe sun's development, and in presenting this theory we shall follow\r\nsubstantially his line of thought, but with some freedom of translation\r\nand many omissions.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"To trace out the primitive source of the planetary movements,\r\nwe have the following five phenomena: (1) These movements all take place\r\nin the same direction and nearly in the same plane. (2) The movements of\r\nthe satellites are in the same direction as those of the planets. (3)\r\nThe rotations of the planets and the sun are in the same direction as\r\nthe orbital motions and nearly in the same plane. (4) Planets and\r\nsatellites alike have nearly circular orbits. (5) The orbits of comets\r\nare wholly unlike these by reason of their great eccentricities and\r\ninclinations to the ecliptic.\" That these coincidences should be purely\r\nthe result of chance seemed to Laplace incredible, and, seeking a cause\r\nfor them, he continues: \"Whatever its nature may be, since it has\r\nproduced or controlled the motions of the planets, it must have reached\r\nout to all these bodies, and, in view of the prodigious distances which\r\nseparate them, the cause can have been nothing else than a fluid of\r\ngreat extent which must have enveloped the sun like an atmosphere. A\r\nconsideration of the planetary motions leads us to think that ... the\r\nsun's atmosphere formerly extended far beyond the orbits of all the\r\nplanets and has shrunk by degrees to its present dimensions.\" This is\r\nnot very different from the idea developed in § 228 from a consideration\r\nof the sun's radiant energy; but in Laplace's day the possibility of\r\ngenerating the sun's heat by contraction of its bulk was unknown, and he\r\nwas compelled to assume a very high temperature for the primitive\r\nnebulous sun, while we now know that this is unnecessary. Whether the\r\nprimitive nebula was hot or cold the shrinkage would take place in much\r\nthe same way, and would finally result in a star or sun of very high\r\ntemperature, but its development would be slower if it were hot in the\r\nbeginning than if it were cold.\r\n\r\nBut again Laplace: \"How did the sun's atmosphere determine the rotations\r\nand revolutions of planets and satellites? If these bodies had been\r\ndeeply immersed in this atmosphere its resistance to their motion would\r\nhave made them fall into the sun, and we may therefore conjecture that\r\nthe planets were formed, one by one, at the outer limits of the solar\r\natmosphere by the condensation of zones of vapor which were cast off in\r\nthe plane of the sun's equator.\" Here he proceeds to show by an appeal\r\nto dynamical principles that something of this kind must happen, and\r\nthat the matter sloughed off by the nebula in the form of a ring,\r\nperhaps comparable to the rings of Saturn or the asteroid zone, would\r\nultimately condense into a planet, which in its turn might shrink and\r\ncast off rings to produce satellites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIERRE SIMON LAPLACE (1749-1827).]\r\n\r\nPlanets and satellites would then all have similar motions, as noted at\r\nthe beginning of this section, since in every case this motion is an\r\ninheritance from a common source, the rotation of the primitive\r\nnebula about its own axis. \"All the bodies which circle around a planet\r\nhaving been thus formed from rings which its atmosphere successively\r\nabandoned as rotation became more and more rapid, this rotation should\r\ntake place in less time than is required for the orbital revolution of\r\nany of the bodies which have been cast off, and this holds true for the\r\nsun as compared with the planets.\"\r\n\r\n231. OBJECTIONS TO THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.--In Laplace's time this\r\nslower rate of motion was also supposed to hold true for Saturn's rings\r\nas compared with the rotation of Saturn itself, but, as we have seen in\r\nChapter XI, this ring is made up of a great number of independent\r\nparticles which move at different rates of speed, and comparing, through\r\nKepler's Third Law, the motion of the inner edge of the ring with the\r\nknown periodic time of the satellites, we may find that these particles\r\nmust rotate about Saturn more rapidly than the planet turns upon its\r\naxis. Similarly the inner satellite of Mars completes its revolution in\r\nabout one third of a Martian day, and we find in cases like this grounds\r\nfor objection to the nebular theory. Compare also Laplace's argument\r\nwith the peculiar rotations of Uranus, Neptune, and their satellites\r\n(Chapter XI). Do these fortify or weaken his case?\r\n\r\nDespite these objections and others equally serious that have been\r\nraised, the nebular theory agrees with the facts of Nature at so many\r\npoints that astronomers upon the whole are strongly inclined to accept\r\nits major outlines as being at least an approximation to the course of\r\ndevelopment actually followed by the solar system; but at some\r\npoints--e. g., the formation of planets and satellites through the\r\ncasting off of nebulous rings--the objections are so many and strong as\r\nto call for revision and possibly serious modification of the theory.\r\n\r\nOne proposed modification, much discussed in recent years, consists in\r\nsubstituting for the primitive _gaseous_ nebula imagined by Laplace, a\r\nvery diffuse cloud of meteoric matter which in the course of its\r\ndevelopment would become transformed into the gaseous state by rising\r\ntemperature. From this point of view much of the meteoric dust still\r\nscattered throughout the solar system may be only the fragments left\r\nover in fashioning the sun and planets. Chamberlin and Moulton, who have\r\nrecently given much attention to this subject, in dissenting from some\r\nof Laplace's views, consider that the primitive nebulous condition must\r\nhave been one in which the matter of the system was \"so brought together\r\nas to give low mass, high momentum, and irregular distribution to the\r\nouter part, and high mass, low momentum, and sphericity to the central\r\npart,\" and they suggest a possible oblique collision of a small nebula\r\nwith the outer parts of a large one.\r\n\r\n232. BODE'S LAW.--We should not leave the theory of Laplace without\r\nnoting the light it casts upon one point otherwise obscure--the meaning\r\nof Bode's law (§ 134). This law, stated in mathematical form, makes a\r\ngeometrical series, and similar geometrical series apply to the\r\ndistances of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn from these planets.\r\nNow, Roche has shown by the application of physical laws to the\r\nshrinkage of a gaseous body that its radius at any time may be expressed\r\nby means of a certain mathematical formula very similar to Bode's law,\r\nsave that it involves the amount of time that has elapsed since the\r\nbeginning of the shrinking process. By comparing this formula with the\r\none corresponding to Bode's law he reaches the conclusion that the\r\npeculiar spacing of the planets expressed by that law means that they\r\nwere formed at successive _equal_ intervals of time--i. e., that Mars is\r\nas much older than the earth as the earth is older than Venus, etc. The\r\nfailure of Bode's law in the case of Neptune would then imply that the\r\ninterval of time between the formation of Neptune and Uranus was shorter\r\nthan that which has prevailed for the other planets. But too much\r\nstress should not be placed upon this conclusion. So long as the manner\r\nin which the planets came into being continues an open question,\r\nconclusions about their time of birth must remain of doubtful validity.\r\n\r\n233. TIDAL FRICTION BETWEEN EARTH AND MOON.--An important addition to\r\ntheories of development within the solar system has been worked out by\r\nProf. G. H. Darwin, who, starting with certain very simple assumptions\r\nas to the present condition of things in earth and moon, derives from\r\nthese, by a strict process of mathematical reasoning, far-reaching\r\nconclusions of great interest and importance. The key to these\r\nconclusions lies in recognition of the fact that through the influence\r\nof the tides (§ 42) there is now in progress and has been in progress\r\nfor a very long time, a gradual transfer of motion (moment of momentum)\r\nfrom the earth to the moon. The earth's motion of rotation is being\r\nslowly destroyed by the friction of the tides, as the motion of a\r\nbicycle is destroyed by the friction of a brake, and, in consequence of\r\nthis slowing down, the moon is pushed farther and farther away from the\r\nearth, so that it now moves in a larger orbit than it had some millions\r\nof years ago.\r\n\r\nFig. 24 has been used to illustrate the action of the moon in raising\r\ntides upon the earth, but in accordance with the third law of motion\r\n(§ 36) this action must be accompanied by an equal and contrary reaction\r\nwhose nature may readily be seen from the same figure. The moon moves\r\nabout its orbit from west to east and the earth rotates about its axis\r\nin the same direction, as shown by the curved arrow in the figure. The\r\ntidal wave, _I_, therefore points a little _in advance_ of the moon's\r\nposition in its orbit and by its attraction must tend to pull the moon\r\nahead in its orbital motion a little faster than it would move if the\r\nwhole substance of the earth were placed inside the sphere represented\r\nby the broken circle in the figure. It is true that the tidal wave at\r\n_I´´_ pulls back and tends to neutralize the effect of the wave at _I_,\r\nbut on the whole the tidal wave nearer the moon has the stronger\r\ninfluence, and the moon on the whole moves a very little faster, and by\r\nvirtue of this added impetus draws continually a little farther away\r\nfrom the earth than it would if there were no tides.\r\n\r\n234. CONSEQUENCES OF TIDAL FRICTION UPON THE EARTH.--This process of\r\nmoving the moon away from the earth is a cumulative one, going on\r\ncentury after century, and with reference to it the moon's orbit must be\r\ndescribed not as a circle or ellipse, or any other curve which returns\r\ninto itself, but as a spiral, like the balance spring of a watch, each\r\nof whose coils is a little larger than the preceding one, although this\r\nexcess is, to be sure, very small, because the tides themselves are\r\nsmall and the tidal influence feeble when compared with the whole\r\nattraction of the earth for the moon. But, given time enough, even this\r\nsmall force may accomplish great results, and something like 100,000,000\r\nyears of past opportunity would have sufficed for the tidal forces to\r\nmove the moon from close proximity with the earth out to its present\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nFor millions of years to come, if moon and earth endure so long, the\r\ndistance between them must go on increasing, although at an ever slower\r\nrate, since the farther away the moon goes the smaller will be the tides\r\nand the slower the working out of their results. On the other hand, when\r\nthe moon was nearer the earth than now, tidal influences must have been\r\ngreater and their effects more rapidly produced than at the present\r\ntime, particularly if, as seems probable, at some past epoch the earth\r\nwas hot and plastic like Jupiter and Saturn. Then, instead of tides in\r\nthe water of the sea, such as we now have, the whole substance of the\r\nearth would respond to the moon's attraction in _bodily tides_ of\r\nsemi-fluid matter not only higher, but with greater internal friction of\r\ntheir molecules one upon another, and correspondingly greater effect in\r\nchecking the earth's rotation.\r\n\r\nBut, whether the tide be a bodily one or confined to the waters of the\r\nsea, so long as the moon causes it to flow there will be a certain\r\namount of friction which will affect the earth much as a brake affects a\r\nrevolving wheel, slowing down its motion, and producing thus a longer\r\nday as well as a longer month on account of the moon's increased\r\ndistance. Slowing down the earth's rotation is the direct action of the\r\nmoon upon the earth. Pushing the moon away is the form in which the\r\nearth's equal and contrary reaction manifests itself.\r\n\r\n235. CONSEQUENCES OF TIDAL FRICTION UPON THE MOON.--When the moon was\r\nplastic the earth must have raised in it a bodily tide manifold greater\r\nthan the lunar tides upon the earth, and, as we have seen in Chapter IX,\r\nthis tide has long since worn out the greater part of the moon's\r\nrotation and brought our satellite to the condition in which it presents\r\nalways the same face toward the earth.\r\n\r\nThese two processes, slowing down the rotation and pushing away the\r\ndisturbing body, are inseparable--one requires the other; and it is\r\nworth noting in this connection that when for any reason the tide ceases\r\nto flow, and the tidal wave takes up a permanent position, as it has in\r\nthe moon (§ 99), its work is ended, for when there is no motion of the\r\nwave there can be no friction to further reduce the rate of rotation of\r\nthe one body, and no reaction to that friction to push away the other.\r\nBut this permanent and stationary tidal wave in the moon, or elsewhere,\r\nmeans that the satellite presents always the same face toward its\r\nplanet, moving once about its orbit in the time required for one\r\nrevolution upon its axis, and the tide raised by the moon upon the earth\r\ntends to produce here the result long since achieved in our satellite,\r\nto make our day and month of equal length, and to make the earth turn\r\nalways the same side toward the moon. But the moon's tidal force is\r\nsmall compared with that of the earth, and has a vastly greater momentum\r\nto overcome, so that its work upon the earth is not yet complete.\r\nAccording to Thomson and Tait, the moon must be pushed off another\r\nhundred thousand miles, and the day lengthened out by tidal influence to\r\nseven of our present weeks before the day and the lunar month are made\r\nof equal length, and the moon thereby permanently hidden from one\r\nhemisphere of the earth.\r\n\r\n236. THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM.--Retracing into the past the course of\r\ndevelopment of the earth and moon, it is possible to reach back by means\r\nof the mathematical theory of tidal friction to a time at which these\r\nbodies were much nearer to each other than now, but it has not been\r\nfound possible to trace out the mode of their separation from one body\r\ninto two, as is supposed in the nebular theory. In the earliest part of\r\ntheir history accessible to mathematical analysis they are distinct\r\nbodies at some considerable distance from each other, with the earth\r\nrotating about an axis more nearly perpendicular to the moon's orbit and\r\nto the ecliptic than is now the case. Starting from such a condition,\r\nthe lunar tides, according to Darwin, have been instrumental in tipping\r\nthe earth's rotation axis into its present oblique position, and in\r\ndetermining the eccentricity of the moon's orbit and its position with\r\nrespect to the ecliptic as well as the present length of day and month.\r\n\r\n337. TIDAL FRICTION UPON THE PLANETS.--The satellites of the outer\r\nplanets are equally subject to influences of this kind, and there\r\nappears to be independent evidence that some of them, at least, turn\r\nalways the same face toward their respective planets, indicating that\r\nthe work of tidal friction has here been accomplished. We saw in Chapter\r\nXI that it is at present an open question whether the inner planets,\r\nVenus and Mercury, do not always turn the same face toward the sun,\r\ntheir day and year being of equal length. In addition to the direct\r\nobservational evidence upon this point, Schiaparelli has sought to show\r\nby an appeal to tidal theory that such is probably the case, at least\r\nfor Mercury, since the tidal forces which tend to bring about this\r\nresult in that planet are about as great as the forces which have\r\ncertainly produced it in the case of the moon and Saturn's satellite,\r\nJapetus. The same line of reasoning would show that every satellite in\r\nthe solar system, save possibly the newly discovered ninth satellite of\r\nSaturn, must, as a consequence of tidal friction, turn always the same\r\nface toward its planet.\r\n\r\n238. THE SOLAR TIDE.--The sun also raises tides in the earth, and their\r\ninfluence must be similar in character to that of the lunar tides,\r\nchecking the rotation of the earth and thrusting earth and sun apart,\r\nalthough quantitatively these effects are small compared with those of\r\nthe moon. They must, however, continue so long as the solar tide lasts,\r\npossibly until the day and year are made of equal length--i. e., they\r\nmay continue long after the lunar tidal influence has ceased to push\r\nearth and moon apart. Should this be the case, a curious inverse effect\r\nwill be produced. The day being then longer than the month, the moon\r\nwill again raise a tide in the earth which will run around it _from west\r\nto east_, opposite to the course of the present tide, thus tending to\r\naccelerate the earth's rotation, and by its reaction to bring the moon\r\nback toward the earth again, and ultimately to fall upon it.\r\n\r\nWe may note that an effect of this kind must be in progress now between\r\nMars and its inner satellite, Phobos, whose time of orbital revolution\r\nis only one third of a Martian day. It seems probable that this\r\nsatellite is in the last stages of its existence as an independent body,\r\nand must ultimately fall into Mars.\r\n\r\n239. ROCHE'S LIMIT.--In looking forward to such a catastrophe, however,\r\ndue regard must be paid to a dynamical principle of a different\r\ncharacter. The moon can never be precipitated upon the earth entire,\r\nsince before it reaches us it will have been torn asunder by the excess\r\nof the earth's attraction for the near side of its satellite over that\r\nwhich it exerts upon the far side. As the result of Roche's mathematical\r\nanalysis we are able to assign a limiting distance between any planet\r\nand its satellite within which the satellite, if it turns always the\r\nsame face toward the planet, can not come without being broken into\r\nfragments. If we represent the radius of the planet by _r_, and the\r\nquotient obtained by dividing the density of the planet by the density\r\nof the satellite by _q_, then\r\n\r\n    Roche's limit = 2.44 × r × q^{1/3}.\r\n\r\nThus in the case of earth and moon we find from the densities given in\r\n§ 95, _q_ = 1.65, and with _r_ = 3,963 miles we obtain 11,400 miles as\r\nthe nearest approach which the moon could make to the earth without\r\nbeing broken up by the difference of the earth's attractions for its\r\nopposite sides.\r\n\r\nWe must observe, however, that Roche's limit takes no account of\r\nmolecular forces, the adhesion of one molecule to another, by virtue of\r\nwhich a stick or stone resists fracture, but is concerned only with the\r\ngravitative forces by which the molecules are attracted toward the\r\nmoon's center and toward the earth. Within a stone or rock of moderate\r\nsize these gravitative forces are insignificant, and cohesion is the\r\nchief factor in preserving its integrity, but in a large body like the\r\nmoon, the case is just reversed, cohesion plays a small part and\r\ngravitation a large one in holding the body together. We may conclude,\r\ntherefore, that at a proper distance these forces are capable of\r\nbreaking up the moon, or any other large body, into fragments of a size\r\nsuch that molecular cohesion instead of gravitation is the chief agent\r\nin preserving them from further disintegration.\r\n\r\n240. SATURN'S RINGS.--Saturn's rings are of peculiar interest in this\r\nconnection. The outer edge of the ring system lies just inside of\r\nRoche's limit for this planet, and we have already seen that the rings\r\nare composed of small fragments independent of each other. Whatever may\r\nhave been the process by which the nine satellites of Saturn came into\r\nexistence, we have in Roche's limit the explanation why the material of\r\nthe ring was not worked up into satellites; the forces exerted by Saturn\r\nwould tear into pieces any considerable satellite thus formed and\r\nequally would prevent the formation of one from raw material.\r\n\r\nSaturn's rings present the only case within the solar system where\r\nmatter is known to be revolving about a planet at a distance less than\r\nRoche's limit, and it is an interesting question whether these rings can\r\nremain as a permanent part of the planet's system or are only a\r\ntemporary feature. The drawings of Saturn made two centuries ago agree\r\namong themselves in representing the rings as larger than they now\r\nappear, and there is some reason to suppose that as a consequence of\r\nmutual disturbances--collisions--their momentum is being slowly wasted\r\nso that ultimately they must be precipitated into the planet. But the\r\ndirect evidence of such a progress that can be drawn from present data\r\nis too scanty to justify positive conclusions in the matter. On the\r\nother hand, Nolan suggests that in the outer parts of the ring small\r\nsatellites might be formed whose tidal influence upon Saturn would\r\nsuffice to push them away from the ring beyond Roche's limit, and that\r\nthe very small inner satellites of Saturn may have been thus formed at\r\nthe expense of the ring.\r\n\r\nThe inner satellite of Mars is very close to Roche's limit for that\r\nplanet, and, as we have seen above, must be approaching still nearer to\r\nthe danger line.\r\n\r\n241. THE MOON'S DEVELOPMENT.--The fine series of photographs of the moon\r\nobtained within the last few years at Paris, have been used by the\r\nastronomers of that observatory for a minute study of the lunar\r\nformations, much as geologists study the surface of the earth to\r\ndetermine something about the manner in which it was formed. Their\r\nconclusions are, in general, that at some past time the moon was a hot\r\nand fluid body which, as it cooled and condensed, formed a solid crust\r\nwhose further shrinkage compressed the liquid nucleus and led to a long\r\nseries of fractures in the crust and outbursts of liquid matter, whose\r\nlatest and feeblest stages produced the lunar craters, while traces of\r\nthe earlier ones, connected with a general settling of the crust,\r\nalthough nearly obliterated, are still preserved in certain large but\r\nvague features of the lunar topography, such as the distribution of the\r\nseas, etc. They find also in certain markings of the surface what they\r\nconsider convincing evidence of the existence in past times of a lunar\r\natmosphere. But this seems doubtful, since the force of gravity at the\r\nmoon's surface is so small that an atmosphere similar to that of the\r\nearth, even though placed upon the moon, could not permanently endure,\r\nbut would be lost by the gradual escape of its molecules into the\r\nsurrounding space.\r\n\r\nThe molecules of a gas are quite independent one of another, and are in\r\na state of ceaseless agitation, each one darting to and fro, colliding\r\nwith its neighbors or with whatever else opposes its forward motion, and\r\ntraveling with velocities which, on the average, amount to a good many\r\nhundreds of feet per second, although in the case of any individual\r\nmolecule they may be much less or much greater than the average value,\r\nan occasional molecule having possibly a velocity several times as great\r\nas the average. In the upper regions of our own atmosphere, if one of\r\nthese swiftly moving particles of oxygen or nitrogen were headed away\r\nfrom the earth with a velocity of seven miles per second, the whole\r\nattractive power of the earth would be insufficient to check its motion,\r\nand it would therefore, unless stopped by some collision, escape from\r\nthe earth and return no more. But, since this velocity of seven miles\r\nper second is more than thirty times as great as the average velocity of\r\nthe molecules of air, it must be very seldom indeed that one is found to\r\nmove so swiftly, and the loss of the earth's atmosphere by leakage of\r\nthis sort is insignificant. But upon the moon, or any other body where\r\nthe force of gravity is small, conditions are quite different, and in\r\nour satellite a velocity of little more than one mile per second would\r\nsuffice to carry a molecule away from the outer limits of its\r\natmosphere. This velocity, only five times the average, would be\r\nfrequently attained, particularly in former times when the moon's\r\ntemperature was high, for then the average velocity of all the molecules\r\nwould be considerably increased, and the amount of leakage might become,\r\nand probably would become, a serious matter, steadily depleting the\r\nmoon's atmosphere and leading finally to its present state of\r\nexhaustion. It is possible that the moon may at one time have had an\r\natmosphere, but if so it could have been only a temporary possession,\r\nand the same line of reasoning may be applied to the asteroids and to\r\nmost of the satellites of the solar system, and also, though in less\r\ndegree, to the smaller planets, Mercury and Mars.\r\n\r\n242. STELLAR DEVELOPMENT.--We have already considered in this chapter\r\nthe line of development followed by one star, the sun, and treating this\r\nas a typical case, it is commonly believed that the life history of a\r\nstar, in so far as it lies within our reach, begins with a condition in\r\nwhich its matter is widely diffused, and presumably at a low\r\ntemperature. Contracting in bulk under the influence of its own\r\ngravitative forces, the star's temperature rises to a maximum, and then\r\nfalls off in later stages until the body ceases to shine and passes over\r\nto the list of dark stars whose existence can only be detected in\r\nexceptional cases, such as are noted in Chapter XIII. The most\r\nsystematic development of this idea is due to Lockyer, who looks upon\r\nall the celestial bodies--sun, moon and planets, stars, nebulæ, and\r\ncomets--as being only collections of meteoric matter in different stages\r\nof development, and who has sought by means of their spectra to classify\r\nthese bodies and to determine their stage of advancement. While the\r\nfundamental ideas involved in this \"meteoritic hypothesis\" are not\r\nseriously controverted, the detailed application of its principles is\r\nopen to more question, and for the most part those astronomers who hold\r\nthat in the present state of knowledge stellar spectra furnish a key to\r\na star's age or degree of advancement do not venture beyond broad\r\ngeneral statements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--Types of stellar spectra substantially\r\naccording to SECCHI.]\r\n\r\n243. STELLAR SPECTRA.--Thus the types of stellar spectra shown in Fig.\r\n151 are supposed to illustrate successive stages in the development of\r\nan average star. Type I corresponds to the period in which its\r\ntemperature is near the maximum; Type II belongs to a later stage in\r\nwhich the temperature has commenced to fall; and Type III to the period\r\nimmediately preceding extinction.\r\n\r\nWhile human life, or even the duration of the human race, is too short\r\nto permit a single star to be followed through all the stages of its\r\ncareer, an adequate picture of that development might be obtained by\r\nexamining many stars, each at a different stage of progress, and,\r\nfollowing this idea, numerous subdivisions of the types of stellar\r\nspectra shown in Fig. 151 have been proposed in order to represent with\r\nmore detail the process of stellar growth and decay; but for the most\r\npart these subdivisions and their interpretation are accepted by\r\nastronomers with much reserve.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that there are comparatively few stars with spectra of\r\nType III, for this is what we should expect to find if the development\r\nof a star through the last stages of its visible career occupied but a\r\nsmall fraction of its total life. From the same point of view the great\r\nnumber of stars with spectra of the first type would point to a long\r\nduration of this stage of life. The period in which the sun belongs,\r\nrepresented by Type II, probably has a duration intermediate between the\r\nothers. Since most of the variable stars, save those of the Algol class,\r\nhave spectra of the third type, we conclude that variability, with its\r\nassociated ruddy color and great atmospheric absorption of light, is a\r\nsign of old age and approaching extinction. The Algol or eclipse\r\nvariables, on the other hand, having spectra of the first type, are\r\ncomparatively young stars, and, as we shall see a little later, the\r\nshortness of their light periods in some measure confirms this\r\nconclusion drawn from their spectra.\r\n\r\nWe have noted in § 196 that the sun's near neighbors are prevailingly\r\nstars with spectra of the second type, while the Milky Way is mainly\r\ncomposed of first-type stars, and from this we may now conclude that in\r\nour particular part of the entire celestial space the stars are, as a\r\nrule, somewhat further developed than is the case elsewhere.\r\n\r\n244. DOUBLE STARS.--The double stars present special problems of\r\ndevelopment growing out of the effects of tidal friction, which must\r\noperate in them much as it does between earth and moon, tending steadily\r\nto increase the distance between the components of such a star. So, too,\r\nin such a system as is shown in Fig. 132, gravity must tend to make each\r\ncomponent of the double star shrink to smaller dimensions, and this\r\nshrinkage must result in faster rotation and increased tidal friction,\r\nwhich in turn must push the components apart, so that in view of the\r\nsmall density and close proximity of those particular stars we may\r\nfairly regard a star like [b] Lyræ as in the early stages of its\r\ncareer and destined with increasing age to lose its variability of\r\nlight, since the eclipses which now take place must cease with\r\nincreasing distance between the components unless the orbit is turned\r\nexactly edgewise toward the earth. Close proximity and the resulting\r\nshortness of periodic time in a double star seem, therefore, to be\r\nevidence of its youth, and since this shortness of periodic time is\r\ncharacteristic of both Algol variables and spectroscopic binaries as a\r\nclass, we may set them down as being, upon the whole, stars in the early\r\nstages of their career. On the other hand, it is generally true that the\r\nlarger the orbit, and the greater the periodic time in the orbit, the\r\nfarther is the star advanced in its development.\r\n\r\nIn his theory of tidal friction, Darwin has pointed out that whenever\r\nthe periodic time in the orbit is more than twice as long as the time\r\nrequired for rotation about the axis, the effect of the tides is to\r\nincrease the eccentricity of the orbit, and, following this indication,\r\nSee has urged that with increasing distance between the components of a\r\ndouble star their orbits about the common center of gravity must grow\r\nmore and more eccentric, so that we have in the shape of such orbits a\r\nnew index of stellar development; the more eccentric the orbit, the\r\nfarther advanced are the stars. It is important to note in this\r\nconnection that among the double stars whose orbits have been computed\r\nthere seems to run a general rule--the larger the orbit the greater is\r\nits eccentricity--a relation which must hold true if tidal friction\r\noperates as above supposed, and which, being found to hold true,\r\nconfirms in some degree the criteria of stellar age which are furnished\r\nby the theory of tidal friction.\r\n\r\n245. NEBULÆ.--The nebular hypothesis of Laplace has inclined astronomers\r\nto look upon nebulæ in general as material destined to be worked up into\r\nstars, but which is now in a very crude and undeveloped stage. Their\r\ngreat bulk and small density seem also to indicate that gravitation has\r\nnot yet produced in them results at all comparable with what we see in\r\nsun and stars. But even among nebulæ there are to be found very\r\ndifferent stages of development. The irregular nebula, shapeless and\r\nvoid like that of Orion; the spiral, ring, and planetary nebulæ and the\r\nstar cluster, clearly differ in amount of progress toward their final\r\ngoal. But it is by no means sure that these several types are different\r\nstages in one line of development; for example, the primitive nebula\r\nwhich grows into a spiral may never become a ring or planetary nebula,\r\nand _vice versa_. So too there is no reason to suppose that a star\r\ncluster will ever break up into isolated stars such as those whose\r\nrelation to each other is shown in Fig. 122.\r\n\r\n246. CLASSIFICATION.--Considering the heavenly bodies with respect to\r\ntheir stage of development, and arranging them in due order, we should\r\nprobably find lowest down in the scale of progress the irregular nebulæ\r\nof chaotic appearance such as that represented in Fig. 146. Above these\r\nin point of development stand the spiral, ring, and planetary nebulæ,\r\nalthough the exact sequence in which they should be arranged remains a\r\nmatter of doubt. Still higher up in the scale are star clusters whose\r\nindividual members, as well as isolated stars, are to be classified by\r\nmeans of their spectra, as shown in Fig. 151, where the order of\r\ndevelopment of each star is probably from Type I, through II, into III\r\nand beyond, to extinction of its light and the cutting off of most of\r\nits radiant energy. Jupiter and Saturn are to be regarded as stars which\r\nhave recently entered this dark stage. The earth is further developed\r\nthan these, but it is not so far along as are Mars and Mercury; while\r\nthe moon is to be looked upon as the most advanced heavenly body\r\naccessible to our research, having reached a state of decrepitude which\r\nmay almost be called death--a stage typical of that toward which all the\r\nothers are moving.\r\n\r\nMeteors and comets are to be regarded as fragments of celestial matter,\r\nchips, too small to achieve by themselves much progress along the normal\r\nlines of development, but destined sooner or later, by collision with\r\nsome larger body, to share thenceforth in its fortunes.\r\n\r\n247. STABILITY OF THE UNIVERSE.--It was considered a great achievement\r\nin the mathematical astronomy of a century ago when Laplace showed that\r\nthe mutual attractions of sun and planets might indeed produce endless\r\nperturbations in the motions and positions of these bodies, but could\r\nnever bring about collisions among them or greatly alter their existing\r\norbits. But in the proof of this great theorem two influences were\r\nneglected, either of which is fatal to its validity. One of these--tidal\r\nfriction--as we have already seen, tends to wreck the systems of\r\nsatellites, and the same effect must be produced upon the planets by any\r\nother influence which tends to impede their orbital motion. It is the\r\ninertia of the planet in its forward movement that balances the sun's\r\nattraction, and any diminution of the planet's velocity will give this\r\nattraction the upper hand and must ultimately precipitate the planet\r\ninto the sun. The meteoric matter with which the earth comes ceaselessly\r\ninto collision must have just this influence, although its effects are\r\nvery small, and something of the same kind may come from the medium\r\nwhich transmits radiant energy through the interstellar spaces.\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible that the luminiferous ether, which is supposed to\r\npervade all space, should present absolutely no resistance to the motion\r\nof stars and planets rushing through it with velocities which in many\r\ncases exceed 50,000 miles per hour. If there is a resistance to this\r\nmotion, however small, we may extend to the whole visible universe the\r\nwords of Thomson and Tait, who say in their great Treatise on Natural\r\nPhilosophy, \"We have no data in the present state of science for\r\nestimating the relative importance of tidal friction and of the\r\nresistance of the resisting medium through which the earth and moon\r\nmove; but, whatever it may be, there can be but one ultimate result for\r\nsuch a system as that of the sun and planets, if continuing long enough\r\nunder existing laws and not disturbed by meeting with other moving\r\nmasses in space. That result is the falling together of all into one\r\nmass, which, although rotating for a time, must in the end come to rest\r\nrelatively to the surrounding medium.\"\r\n\r\nCompare with this the words of a great poet who in The Tempest puts into\r\nthe mouth of Prospero the lines:\r\n\r\n    \"The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\r\n    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve;\r\n    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\r\n    Leave not a rack behind.\"\r\n\r\n248. THE FUTURE.--In spite of statements like these, it lies beyond the\r\nscope of scientific research to affirm that the visible order of things\r\nwill ever come to naught, and the outcome of present tendencies, as\r\nsketched above, may be profoundly modified in ages to come, by\r\ninfluences of which we are now ignorant. We have already noted that the\r\nfarther our speculation extends into either past or future, the more\r\ninsecure are its conclusions, and the remoter consequences of present\r\nlaws are to be accepted with a corresponding reserve. But the one great\r\nfact which stands out clear in this connection is that of _change_. The\r\nold concept of a universe created in finished form and destined so to\r\nabide until its final dissolution, has passed away from scientific\r\nthought and is replaced by the idea of slow development. A universe\r\nwhich is ever becoming something else and is never finished, as shadowed\r\nforth by Goethe in the lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Thus work I at the roaring loom of Time,\r\n    And weave for Deity a living robe sublime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK ALPHABET\r\n\r\nThe Greek letters are so much used by astronomers in connection with the\r\nnames of the stars, and for other purposes, that the Greek alphabet is\r\nprinted below--not necessarily to be learned, but for convenient\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n        Greek.
