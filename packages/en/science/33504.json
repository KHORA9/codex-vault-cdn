MDCCXXX.\r\n\r\nTITLE PAGE OF THE 1730 EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON'S ADVERTISEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisement I\r\n\r\n\r\n_Part of the ensuing Discourse about Light was written at the Desire of\r\nsome Gentlemen of the_ Royal-Society, _in the Year 1675, and then sent\r\nto their Secretary, and read at their Meetings, and the rest was added\r\nabout twelve Years after to complete the Theory; except the third Book,\r\nand the last Proposition of the Second, which were since put together\r\nout of scatter'd Papers. To avoid being engaged in Disputes about these\r\nMatters, I have hitherto delayed the printing, and should still have\r\ndelayed it, had not the Importunity of Friends prevailed upon me. If any\r\nother Papers writ on this Subject are got out of my Hands they are\r\nimperfect, and were perhaps written before I had tried all the\r\nExperiments here set down, and fully satisfied my self about the Laws of\r\nRefractions and Composition of Colours. I have here publish'd what I\r\nthink proper to come abroad, wishing that it may not be translated into\r\nanother Language without my Consent._\r\n\r\n_The Crowns of Colours, which sometimes appear about the Sun and Moon, I\r\nhave endeavoured to give an Account of; but for want of sufficient\r\nObservations leave that Matter to be farther examined. The Subject of\r\nthe Third Book I have also left imperfect, not having tried all the\r\nExperiments which I intended when I was about these Matters, nor\r\nrepeated some of those which I did try, until I had satisfied my self\r\nabout all their Circumstances. To communicate what I have tried, and\r\nleave the rest to others for farther Enquiry, is all my Design in\r\npublishing these Papers._\r\n\r\n_In a Letter written to Mr._ Leibnitz _in the year 1679, and published\r\nby Dr._ Wallis, _I mention'd a Method by which I had found some general\r\nTheorems about squaring Curvilinear Figures, or comparing them with the\r\nConic Sections, or other the simplest Figures with which they may be\r\ncompared. And some Years ago I lent out a Manuscript containing such\r\nTheorems, and having since met with some Things copied out of it, I have\r\non this Occasion made it publick, prefixing to it an_ Introduction, _and\r\nsubjoining a_ Scholium _concerning that Method. And I have joined with\r\nit another small Tract concerning the Curvilinear Figures of the Second\r\nKind, which was also written many Years ago, and made known to some\r\nFriends, who have solicited the making it publick._\r\n\r\n                                        _I. N._\r\n\r\nApril 1, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisement II\r\n\r\n_In this Second Edition of these Opticks I have omitted the Mathematical\r\nTracts publish'd at the End of the former Edition, as not belonging to\r\nthe Subject. And at the End of the Third Book I have added some\r\nQuestions. And to shew that I do not take Gravity for an essential\r\nProperty of Bodies, I have added one Question concerning its Cause,\r\nchusing to propose it by way of a Question, because I am not yet\r\nsatisfied about it for want of Experiments._\r\n\r\n                                        _I. N._\r\n\r\nJuly 16, 1717.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisement to this Fourth Edition\r\n\r\n_This new Edition of Sir_ Isaac Newton's Opticks _is carefully printed\r\nfrom the Third Edition, as it was corrected by the Author's own Hand,\r\nand left before his Death with the Bookseller. Since Sir_ Isaac's\r\nLectiones Opticae, _which he publickly read in the University of_\r\nCambridge _in the Years 1669, 1670, and 1671, are lately printed, it has\r\nbeen thought proper to make at the bottom of the Pages several Citations\r\nfrom thence, where may be found the Demonstrations, which the Author\r\nomitted in these_ Opticks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: There are several greek letters used in the\r\ndescriptions of the illustrations. They are signified by [Greek:\r\nletter]. Square roots are noted by the letters sqrt before the equation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BOOK OF OPTICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART I._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Design in this Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by\r\nHypotheses, but to propose and prove them by Reason and Experiments: In\r\norder to which I shall premise the following Definitions and Axioms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DEFINITIONS_\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIN. I.\r\n\r\n_By the Rays of Light I understand its least Parts, and those as well\r\nSuccessive in the same Lines, as Contemporary in several Lines._ For it\r\nis manifest that Light consists of Parts, both Successive and\r\nContemporary; because in the same place you may stop that which comes\r\none moment, and let pass that which comes presently after; and in the\r\nsame time you may stop it in any one place, and let it pass in any\r\nother. For that part of Light which is stopp'd cannot be the same with\r\nthat which is let pass. The least Light or part of Light, which may be\r\nstopp'd alone without the rest of the Light, or propagated alone, or do\r\nor suffer any thing alone, which the rest of the Light doth not or\r\nsuffers not, I call a Ray of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIN. II.\r\n\r\n_Refrangibility of the Rays of Light, is their Disposition to be\r\nrefracted or turned out of their Way in passing out of one transparent\r\nBody or Medium into another. And a greater or less Refrangibility of\r\nRays, is their Disposition to be turned more or less out of their Way in\r\nlike Incidences on the same Medium._ Mathematicians usually consider the\r\nRays of Light to be Lines reaching from the luminous Body to the Body\r\nilluminated, and the refraction of those Rays to be the bending or\r\nbreaking of those lines in their passing out of one Medium into another.\r\nAnd thus may Rays and Refractions be considered, if Light be propagated\r\nin an instant. But by an Argument taken from the AEquations of the times\r\nof the Eclipses of _Jupiter's Satellites_, it seems that Light is\r\npropagated in time, spending in its passage from the Sun to us about\r\nseven Minutes of time: And therefore I have chosen to define Rays and\r\nRefractions in such general terms as may agree to Light in both cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIN. III.\r\n\r\n_Reflexibility of Rays, is their Disposition to be reflected or turned\r\nback into the same Medium from any other Medium upon whose Surface they\r\nfall. And Rays are more or less reflexible, which are turned back more\r\nor less easily._ As if Light pass out of a Glass into Air, and by being\r\ninclined more and more to the common Surface of the Glass and Air,\r\nbegins at length to be totally reflected by that Surface; those sorts of\r\nRays which at like Incidences are reflected most copiously, or by\r\ninclining the Rays begin soonest to be totally reflected, are most\r\nreflexible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIN. IV.\r\n\r\n_The Angle of Incidence is that Angle, which the Line described by the\r\nincident Ray contains with the Perpendicular to the reflecting or\r\nrefracting Surface at the Point of Incidence._\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIN. V.\r\n\r\n_The Angle of Reflexion or Refraction, is the Angle which the line\r\ndescribed by the reflected or refracted Ray containeth with the\r\nPerpendicular to the reflecting or refracting Surface at the Point of\r\nIncidence._\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIN. VI.\r\n\r\n_The Sines of Incidence, Reflexion, and Refraction, are the Sines of the\r\nAngles of Incidence, Reflexion, and Refraction._\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIN. VII\r\n\r\n_The Light whose Rays are all alike Refrangible, I call Simple,\r\nHomogeneal and Similar; and that whose Rays are some more Refrangible\r\nthan others, I call Compound, Heterogeneal and Dissimilar._ The former\r\nLight I call Homogeneal, not because I would affirm it so in all\r\nrespects, but because the Rays which agree in Refrangibility, agree at\r\nleast in all those their other Properties which I consider in the\r\nfollowing Discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFIN. VIII.\r\n\r\n_The Colours of Homogeneal Lights, I call Primary, Homogeneal and\r\nSimple; and those of Heterogeneal Lights, Heterogeneal and Compound._\r\nFor these are always compounded of the colours of Homogeneal Lights; as\r\nwill appear in the following Discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_AXIOMS._\r\n\r\n\r\nAX. I.\r\n\r\n_The Angles of Reflexion and Refraction, lie in one and the same Plane\r\nwith the Angle of Incidence._\r\n\r\n\r\nAX. II.\r\n\r\n_The Angle of Reflexion is equal to the Angle of Incidence._\r\n\r\n\r\nAX. III.\r\n\r\n_If the refracted Ray be returned directly back to the Point of\r\nIncidence, it shall be refracted into the Line before described by the\r\nincident Ray._\r\n\r\n\r\nAX. IV.\r\n\r\n_Refraction out of the rarer Medium into the denser, is made towards the\r\nPerpendicular; that is, so that the Angle of Refraction be less than the\r\nAngle of Incidence._\r\n\r\n\r\nAX. V.\r\n\r\n_The Sine of Incidence is either accurately or very nearly in a given\r\nRatio to the Sine of Refraction._\r\n\r\nWhence if that Proportion be known in any one Inclination of the\r\nincident Ray, 'tis known in all the Inclinations, and thereby the\r\nRefraction in all cases of Incidence on the same refracting Body may be\r\ndetermined. Thus if the Refraction be made out of Air into Water, the\r\nSine of Incidence of the red Light is to the Sine of its Refraction as 4\r\nto 3. If out of Air into Glass, the Sines are as 17 to 11. In Light of\r\nother Colours the Sines have other Proportions: but the difference is so\r\nlittle that it need seldom be considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nSuppose therefore, that RS [in _Fig._ 1.] represents the Surface of\r\nstagnating Water, and that C is the point of Incidence in which any Ray\r\ncoming in the Air from A in the Line AC is reflected or refracted, and I\r\nwould know whither this Ray shall go after Reflexion or Refraction: I\r\nerect upon the Surface of the Water from the point of Incidence the\r\nPerpendicular CP and produce it downwards to Q, and conclude by the\r\nfirst Axiom, that the Ray after Reflexion and Refraction, shall be\r\nfound somewhere in the Plane of the Angle of Incidence ACP produced. I\r\nlet fall therefore upon the Perpendicular CP the Sine of Incidence AD;\r\nand if the reflected Ray be desired, I produce AD to B so that DB be\r\nequal to AD, and draw CB. For this Line CB shall be the reflected Ray;\r\nthe Angle of Reflexion BCP and its Sine BD being equal to the Angle and\r\nSine of Incidence, as they ought to be by the second Axiom, But if the\r\nrefracted Ray be desired, I produce AD to H, so that DH may be to AD as\r\nthe Sine of Refraction to the Sine of Incidence, that is, (if the Light\r\nbe red) as 3 to 4; and about the Center C and in the Plane ACP with the\r\nRadius CA describing a Circle ABE, I draw a parallel to the\r\nPerpendicular CPQ, the Line HE cutting the Circumference in E, and\r\njoining CE, this Line CE shall be the Line of the refracted Ray. For if\r\nEF be let fall perpendicularly on the Line PQ, this Line EF shall be the\r\nSine of Refraction of the Ray CE, the Angle of Refraction being ECQ; and\r\nthis Sine EF is equal to DH, and consequently in Proportion to the Sine\r\nof Incidence AD as 3 to 4.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, if there be a Prism of Glass (that is, a Glass bounded\r\nwith two Equal and Parallel Triangular ends, and three plain and well\r\npolished Sides, which meet in three Parallel Lines running from the\r\nthree Angles of one end to the three Angles of the other end) and if the\r\nRefraction of the Light in passing cross this Prism be desired: Let ACB\r\n[in _Fig._ 2.] represent a Plane cutting this Prism transversly to its\r\nthree Parallel lines or edges there where the Light passeth through it,\r\nand let DE be the Ray incident upon the first side of the Prism AC where\r\nthe Light goes into the Glass; and by putting the Proportion of the Sine\r\nof Incidence to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11 find EF the first\r\nrefracted Ray. Then taking this Ray for the Incident Ray upon the second\r\nside of the Glass BC where the Light goes out, find the next refracted\r\nRay FG by putting the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of\r\nRefraction as 11 to 17. For if the Sine of Incidence out of Air into\r\nGlass be to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11, the Sine of Incidence\r\nout of Glass into Air must on the contrary be to the Sine of Refraction\r\nas 11 to 17, by the third Axiom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nMuch after the same manner, if ACBD [in _Fig._ 3.] represent a Glass\r\nspherically convex on both sides (usually called a _Lens_, such as is a\r\nBurning-glass, or Spectacle-glass, or an Object-glass of a Telescope)\r\nand it be required to know how Light falling upon it from any lucid\r\npoint Q shall be refracted, let QM represent a Ray falling upon any\r\npoint M of its first spherical Surface ACB, and by erecting a\r\nPerpendicular to the Glass at the point M, find the first refracted Ray\r\nMN by the Proportion of the Sines 17 to 11. Let that Ray in going out of\r\nthe Glass be incident upon N, and then find the second refracted Ray\r\nN_q_ by the Proportion of the Sines 11 to 17. And after the same manner\r\nmay the Refraction be found when the Lens is convex on one side and\r\nplane or concave on the other, or concave on both sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAX. VI.\r\n\r\n_Homogeneal Rays which flow from several Points of any Object, and fall\r\nperpendicularly or almost perpendicularly on any reflecting or\r\nrefracting Plane or spherical Surface, shall afterwards diverge from so\r\nmany other Points, or be parallel to so many other Lines, or converge to\r\nso many other Points, either accurately or without any sensible Error.\r\nAnd the same thing will happen, if the Rays be reflected or refracted\r\nsuccessively by two or three or more Plane or Spherical Surfaces._\r\n\r\nThe Point from which Rays diverge or to which they converge may be\r\ncalled their _Focus_. And the Focus of the incident Rays being given,\r\nthat of the reflected or refracted ones may be found by finding the\r\nRefraction of any two Rays, as above; or more readily thus.\r\n\r\n_Cas._ 1. Let ACB [in _Fig._ 4.] be a reflecting or refracting Plane,\r\nand Q the Focus of the incident Rays, and Q_q_C a Perpendicular to that\r\nPlane. And if this Perpendicular be produced to _q_, so that _q_C be\r\nequal to QC, the Point _q_ shall be the Focus of the reflected Rays: Or\r\nif _q_C be taken on the same side of the Plane with QC, and in\r\nproportion to QC as the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction, the\r\nPoint _q_ shall be the Focus of the refracted Rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n_Cas._ 2. Let ACB [in _Fig._ 5.] be the reflecting Surface of any Sphere\r\nwhose Centre is E. Bisect any Radius thereof, (suppose EC) in T, and if\r\nin that Radius on the same side the Point T you take the Points Q and\r\n_q_, so that TQ, TE, and T_q_, be continual Proportionals, and the Point\r\nQ be the Focus of the incident Rays, the Point _q_ shall be the Focus of\r\nthe reflected ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n_Cas._ 3. Let ACB [in _Fig._ 6.] be the refracting Surface of any Sphere\r\nwhose Centre is E. In any Radius thereof EC produced both ways take ET\r\nand C_t_ equal to one another and severally in such Proportion to that\r\nRadius as the lesser of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction hath to\r\nthe difference of those Sines. And then if in the same Line you find any\r\ntwo Points Q and _q_, so that TQ be to ET as E_t_ to _tq_, taking _tq_\r\nthe contrary way from _t_ which TQ lieth from T, and if the Point Q be\r\nthe Focus of any incident Rays, the Point _q_ shall be the Focus of the\r\nrefracted ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nAnd by the same means the Focus of the Rays after two or more Reflexions\r\nor Refractions may be found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n_Cas._ 4. Let ACBD [in _Fig._ 7.] be any refracting Lens, spherically\r\nConvex or Concave or Plane on either side, and let CD be its Axis (that\r\nis, the Line which cuts both its Surfaces perpendicularly, and passes\r\nthrough the Centres of the Spheres,) and in this Axis produced let F and\r\n_f_ be the Foci of the refracted Rays found as above, when the incident\r\nRays on both sides the Lens are parallel to the same Axis; and upon the\r\nDiameter F_f_ bisected in E, describe a Circle. Suppose now that any\r\nPoint Q be the Focus of any incident Rays. Draw QE cutting the said\r\nCircle in T and _t_, and therein take _tq_ in such proportion to _t_E as\r\n_t_E or TE hath to TQ. Let _tq_ lie the contrary way from _t_ which TQ\r\ndoth from T, and _q_ shall be the Focus of the refracted Rays without\r\nany sensible Error, provided the Point Q be not so remote from the Axis,\r\nnor the Lens so broad as to make any of the Rays fall too obliquely on\r\nthe refracting Surfaces.[A]\r\n\r\nAnd by the like Operations may the reflecting or refracting Surfaces be\r\nfound when the two Foci are given, and thereby a Lens be formed, which\r\nshall make the Rays flow towards or from what Place you please.[B]\r\n\r\nSo then the Meaning of this Axiom is, that if Rays fall upon any Plane\r\nor Spherical Surface or Lens, and before their Incidence flow from or\r\ntowards any Point Q, they shall after Reflexion or Refraction flow from\r\nor towards the Point _q_ found by the foregoing Rules. And if the\r\nincident Rays flow from or towards several points Q, the reflected or\r\nrefracted Rays shall flow from or towards so many other Points _q_\r\nfound by the same Rules. Whether the reflected and refracted Rays flow\r\nfrom or towards the Point _q_ is easily known by the situation of that\r\nPoint. For if that Point be on the same side of the reflecting or\r\nrefracting Surface or Lens with the Point Q, and the incident Rays flow\r\nfrom the Point Q, the reflected flow towards the Point _q_ and the\r\nrefracted from it; and if the incident Rays flow towards Q, the\r\nreflected flow from _q_, and the refracted towards it. And the contrary\r\nhappens when _q_ is on the other side of the Surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nAX. VII.\r\n\r\n_Wherever the Rays which come from all the Points of any Object meet\r\nagain in so many Points after they have been made to converge by\r\nReflection or Refraction, there they will make a Picture of the Object\r\nupon any white Body on which they fall._\r\n\r\nSo if PR [in _Fig._ 3.] represent any Object without Doors, and AB be a\r\nLens placed at a hole in the Window-shut of a dark Chamber, whereby the\r\nRays that come from any Point Q of that Object are made to converge and\r\nmeet again in the Point _q_; and if a Sheet of white Paper be held at\r\n_q_ for the Light there to fall upon it, the Picture of that Object PR\r\nwill appear upon the Paper in its proper shape and Colours. For as the\r\nLight which comes from the Point Q goes to the Point _q_, so the Light\r\nwhich comes from other Points P and R of the Object, will go to so many\r\nother correspondent Points _p_ and _r_ (as is manifest by the sixth\r\nAxiom;) so that every Point of the Object shall illuminate a\r\ncorrespondent Point of the Picture, and thereby make a Picture like the\r\nObject in Shape and Colour, this only excepted, that the Picture shall\r\nbe inverted. And this is the Reason of that vulgar Experiment of casting\r\nthe Species of Objects from abroad upon a Wall or Sheet of white Paper\r\nin a dark Room.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, when a Man views any Object PQR, [in _Fig._ 8.] the\r\nLight which comes from the several Points of the Object is so refracted\r\nby the transparent skins and humours of the Eye, (that is, by the\r\noutward coat EFG, called the _Tunica Cornea_, and by the crystalline\r\nhumour AB which is beyond the Pupil _mk_) as to converge and meet again\r\nin so many Points in the bottom of the Eye, and there to paint the\r\nPicture of the Object upon that skin (called the _Tunica Retina_) with\r\nwhich the bottom of the Eye is covered. For Anatomists, when they have\r\ntaken off from the bottom of the Eye that outward and most thick Coat\r\ncalled the _Dura Mater_, can then see through the thinner Coats, the\r\nPictures of Objects lively painted thereon. And these Pictures,\r\npropagated by Motion along the Fibres of the Optick Nerves into the\r\nBrain, are the cause of Vision. For accordingly as these Pictures are\r\nperfect or imperfect, the Object is seen perfectly or imperfectly. If\r\nthe Eye be tinged with any colour (as in the Disease of the _Jaundice_)\r\nso as to tinge the Pictures in the bottom of the Eye with that Colour,\r\nthen all Objects appear tinged with the same Colour. If the Humours of\r\nthe Eye by old Age decay, so as by shrinking to make the _Cornea_ and\r\nCoat of the _Crystalline Humour_ grow flatter than before, the Light\r\nwill not be refracted enough, and for want of a sufficient Refraction\r\nwill not converge to the bottom of the Eye but to some place beyond it,\r\nand by consequence paint in the bottom of the Eye a confused Picture,\r\nand according to the Indistinctness of this Picture the Object will\r\nappear confused. This is the reason of the decay of sight in old Men,\r\nand shews why their Sight is mended by Spectacles. For those Convex\r\nglasses supply the defect of plumpness in the Eye, and by increasing the\r\nRefraction make the Rays converge sooner, so as to convene distinctly at\r\nthe bottom of the Eye if the Glass have a due degree of convexity. And\r\nthe contrary happens in short-sighted Men whose Eyes are too plump. For\r\nthe Refraction being now too great, the Rays converge and convene in the\r\nEyes before they come at the bottom; and therefore the Picture made in\r\nthe bottom and the Vision caused thereby will not be distinct, unless\r\nthe Object be brought so near the Eye as that the place where the\r\nconverging Rays convene may be removed to the bottom, or that the\r\nplumpness of the Eye be taken off and the Refractions diminished by a\r\nConcave-glass of a due degree of Concavity, or lastly that by Age the\r\nEye grow flatter till it come to a due Figure: For short-sighted Men see\r\nremote Objects best in Old Age, and therefore they are accounted to have\r\nthe most lasting Eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAX. VIII.\r\n\r\n_An Object seen by Reflexion or Refraction, appears in that place from\r\nwhence the Rays after their last Reflexion or Refraction diverge in\r\nfalling on the Spectator's Eye._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nIf the Object A [in FIG. 9.] be seen by Reflexion of a Looking-glass\r\n_mn_, it shall appear, not in its proper place A, but behind the Glass\r\nat _a_, from whence any Rays AB, AC, AD, which flow from one and the\r\nsame Point of the Object, do after their Reflexion made in the Points B,\r\nC, D, diverge in going from the Glass to E, F, G, where they are\r\nincident on the Spectator's Eyes. For these Rays do make the same\r\nPicture in the bottom of the Eyes as if they had come from the Object\r\nreally placed at _a_ without the Interposition of the Looking-glass; and\r\nall Vision is made according to the place and shape of that Picture.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the Object D [in FIG. 2.] seen through a Prism, appears\r\nnot in its proper place D, but is thence translated to some other place\r\n_d_ situated in the last refracted Ray FG drawn backward from F to _d_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nAnd so the Object Q [in FIG. 10.] seen through the Lens AB, appears at\r\nthe place _q_ from whence the Rays diverge in passing from the Lens to\r\nthe Eye. Now it is to be noted, that the Image of the Object at _q_ is\r\nso much bigger or lesser than the Object it self at Q, as the distance\r\nof the Image at _q_ from the Lens AB is bigger or less than the distance\r\nof the Object at Q from the same Lens. And if the Object be seen through\r\ntwo or more such Convex or Concave-glasses, every Glass shall make a new\r\nImage, and the Object shall appear in the place of the bigness of the\r\nlast Image. Which consideration unfolds the Theory of Microscopes and\r\nTelescopes. For that Theory consists in almost nothing else than the\r\ndescribing such Glasses as shall make the last Image of any Object as\r\ndistinct and large and luminous as it can conveniently be made.\r\n\r\nI have now given in Axioms and their Explications the sum of what hath\r\nhitherto been treated of in Opticks. For what hath been generally\r\nagreed on I content my self to assume under the notion of Principles, in\r\norder to what I have farther to write. And this may suffice for an\r\nIntroduction to Readers of quick Wit and good Understanding not yet\r\nversed in Opticks: Although those who are already acquainted with this\r\nScience, and have handled Glasses, will more readily apprehend what\r\nfolloweth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] In our Author's _Lectiones Opticae_, Part I. Sect. IV. Prop 29, 30,\r\nthere is an elegant Method of determining these _Foci_; not only in\r\nspherical Surfaces, but likewise in any other curved Figure whatever:\r\nAnd in Prop. 32, 33, the same thing is done for any Ray lying out of the\r\nAxis.\r\n\r\n[B] _Ibid._ Prop. 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROPOSITIONS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ I.

The Paper was very black, and\r\nthe Colours intense and thickly laid on, that the Phaenomenon might be\r\nmore conspicuous. This Paper I view'd through a Prism of solid Glass,\r\nwhose two Sides through which the Light passed to the Eye were plane and\r\nwell polished, and contained an Angle of about sixty degrees; which\r\nAngle I call the refracting Angle of the Prism. And whilst I view'd it,\r\nI held it and the Prism before a Window in such manner that the Sides of\r\nthe Paper were parallel to the Prism, and both those Sides and the Prism\r\nwere parallel to the Horizon, and the cross Line was also parallel to\r\nit: and that the Light which fell from the Window upon the Paper made an\r\nAngle with the Paper, equal to that Angle which was made with the same\r\nPaper by the Light reflected from it to the Eye. Beyond the Prism was\r\nthe Wall of the Chamber under the Window covered over with black Cloth,\r\nand the Cloth was involved in Darkness that no Light might be reflected\r\nfrom thence, which in passing by the Edges of the Paper to the Eye,\r\nmight mingle itself with the Light of the Paper, and obscure the\r\nPhaenomenon thereof. These things being thus ordered, I found that if the\r\nrefracting Angle of the Prism be turned upwards, so that the Paper may\r\nseem to be lifted upwards by the Refraction, its blue half will be\r\nlifted higher by the Refraction than its red half. But if the refracting\r\nAngle of the Prism be turned downward, so that the Paper may seem to be\r\ncarried lower by the Refraction, its blue half will be carried something\r\nlower thereby than its red half. Wherefore in both Cases the Light which\r\ncomes from the blue half of the Paper through the Prism to the Eye, does\r\nin like Circumstances suffer a greater Refraction than the Light which\r\ncomes from the red half, and by consequence is more refrangible.\r\n\r\n_Illustration._ In the eleventh Figure, MN represents the Window, and DE\r\nthe Paper terminated with parallel Sides DJ and HE, and by the\r\ntransverse Line FG distinguished into two halfs, the one DG of an\r\nintensely blue Colour, the other FE of an intensely red. And BAC_cab_\r\nrepresents the Prism whose refracting Planes AB_ba_ and AC_ca_ meet in\r\nthe Edge of the refracting Angle A_a_. This Edge A_a_ being upward, is\r\nparallel both to the Horizon, and to the Parallel-Edges of the Paper DJ\r\nand HE, and the transverse Line FG is perpendicular to the Plane of the\r\nWindow. And _de_ represents the Image of the Paper seen by Refraction\r\nupwards in such manner, that the blue half DG is carried higher to _dg_\r\nthan the red half FE is to _fe_, and therefore suffers a greater\r\nRefraction. If the Edge of the refracting Angle be turned downward, the\r\nImage of the Paper will be refracted downward; suppose to [Greek: de],\r\nand the blue half will be refracted lower to [Greek: dg] than the red\r\nhalf is to [Greek: pe].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 2. About the aforesaid Paper, whose two halfs were painted over\r\nwith red and blue, and which was stiff like thin Pasteboard, I lapped\r\nseveral times a slender Thred of very black Silk, in such manner that\r\nthe several parts of the Thred might appear upon the Colours like so\r\nmany black Lines drawn over them, or like long and slender dark Shadows\r\ncast upon them. I might have drawn black Lines with a Pen, but the\r\nThreds were smaller and better defined. This Paper thus coloured and\r\nlined I set against a Wall perpendicularly to the Horizon, so that one\r\nof the Colours might stand to the Right Hand, and the other to the Left.\r\nClose before the Paper, at the Confine of the Colours below, I placed a\r\nCandle to illuminate the Paper strongly: For the Experiment was tried in\r\nthe Night. The Flame of the Candle reached up to the lower edge of the\r\nPaper, or a very little higher. Then at the distance of six Feet, and\r\none or two Inches from the Paper upon the Floor I erected a Glass Lens\r\nfour Inches and a quarter broad, which might collect the Rays coming\r\nfrom the several Points of the Paper, and make them converge towards so\r\nmany other Points at the same distance of six Feet, and one or two\r\nInches on the other side of the Lens, and so form the Image of the\r\ncoloured Paper upon a white Paper placed there, after the same manner\r\nthat a Lens at a Hole in a Window casts the Images of Objects abroad\r\nupon a Sheet of white Paper in a dark Room. The aforesaid white Paper,\r\nerected perpendicular to the Horizon, and to the Rays which fell upon it\r\nfrom the Lens, I moved sometimes towards the Lens, sometimes from it, to\r\nfind the Places where the Images of the blue and red Parts of the\r\ncoloured Paper appeared most distinct. Those Places I easily knew by the\r\nImages of the black Lines which I had made by winding the Silk about the\r\nPaper. For the Images of those fine and slender Lines (which by reason\r\nof their Blackness were like Shadows on the Colours) were confused and\r\nscarce visible, unless when the Colours on either side of each Line were\r\nterminated most distinctly, Noting therefore, as diligently as I could,\r\nthe Places where the Images of the red and blue halfs of the coloured\r\nPaper appeared most distinct, I found that where the red half of the\r\nPaper appeared distinct, the blue half appeared confused, so that the\r\nblack Lines drawn upon it could scarce be seen; and on the contrary,\r\nwhere the blue half appeared most distinct, the red half appeared\r\nconfused, so that the black Lines upon it were scarce visible. And\r\nbetween the two Places where these Images appeared distinct there was\r\nthe distance of an Inch and a half; the distance of the white Paper from\r\nthe Lens, when the Image of the red half of the coloured Paper appeared\r\nmost distinct, being greater by an Inch and an half than the distance of\r\nthe same white Paper from the Lens, when the Image of the blue half\r\nappeared most distinct. In like Incidences therefore of the blue and red\r\nupon the Lens, the blue was refracted more by the Lens than the red, so\r\nas to converge sooner by an Inch and a half, and therefore is more\r\nrefrangible.\r\n\r\n_Illustration._ In the twelfth Figure (p. 27), DE signifies the coloured\r\nPaper, DG the blue half, FE the red half, MN the Lens, HJ the white\r\nPaper in that Place where the red half with its black Lines appeared\r\ndistinct, and _hi_ the same Paper in that Place where the blue half\r\nappeared distinct. The Place _hi_ was nearer to the Lens MN than the\r\nPlace HJ by an Inch and an half.\r\n\r\n_Scholium._ The same Things succeed, notwithstanding that some of the\r\nCircumstances be varied; as in the first Experiment when the Prism and\r\nPaper are any ways inclined to the Horizon, and in both when coloured\r\nLines are drawn upon very black Paper. But in the Description of these\r\nExperiments, I have set down such Circumstances, by which either the\r\nPhaenomenon might be render'd more conspicuous, or a Novice might more\r\neasily try them, or by which I did try them only. The same Thing, I have\r\noften done in the following Experiments: Concerning all which, this one\r\nAdmonition may suffice. Now from these Experiments it follows not, that\r\nall the Light of the blue is more refrangible than all the Light of the\r\nred: For both Lights are mixed of Rays differently refrangible, so that\r\nin the red there are some Rays not less refrangible than those of the\r\nblue, and in the blue there are some Rays not more refrangible than\r\nthose of the red: But these Rays, in proportion to the whole Light, are\r\nbut few, and serve to diminish the Event of the Experiment, but are not\r\nable to destroy it. For, if the red and blue Colours were more dilute\r\nand weak, the distance of the Images would be less than an Inch and a\r\nhalf; and if they were more intense and full, that distance would be\r\ngreater, as will appear hereafter. These Experiments may suffice for the\r\nColours of Natural Bodies. For in the Colours made by the Refraction of\r\nPrisms, this Proposition will appear by the Experiments which are now to\r\nfollow in the next Proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ II. THEOR. II.\r\n\r\n_The Light of the Sun consists of Rays differently Refrangible._\r\n\r\nThe PROOF by Experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 3.\r\n\r\nIn a very dark Chamber, at a round Hole, about one third Part of an Inch\r\nbroad, made in the Shut of a Window, I placed a Glass Prism, whereby the\r\nBeam of the Sun's Light, which came in at that Hole, might be refracted\r\nupwards toward the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and there form a\r\ncolour'd Image of the Sun. The Axis of the Prism (that is, the Line\r\npassing through the middle of the Prism from one end of it to the other\r\nend parallel to the edge of the Refracting Angle) was in this and the\r\nfollowing Experiments perpendicular to the incident Rays. About this\r\nAxis I turned the Prism slowly, and saw the refracted Light on the Wall,\r\nor coloured Image of the Sun, first to descend, and then to ascend.\r\nBetween the Descent and Ascent, when the Image seemed Stationary, I\r\nstopp'd the Prism, and fix'd it in that Posture, that it should be moved\r\nno more. For in that Posture the Refractions of the Light at the two\r\nSides of the refracting Angle, that is, at the Entrance of the Rays into\r\nthe Prism, and at their going out of it, were equal to one another.[C]\r\nSo also in other Experiments, as often as I would have the Refractions\r\non both sides the Prism to be equal to one another, I noted the Place\r\nwhere the Image of the Sun formed by the refracted Light stood still\r\nbetween its two contrary Motions, in the common Period of its Progress\r\nand Regress; and when the Image fell upon that Place, I made fast the\r\nPrism. And in this Posture, as the most convenient, it is to be\r\nunderstood that all the Prisms are placed in the following Experiments,\r\nunless where some other Posture is described. The Prism therefore being\r\nplaced in this Posture, I let the refracted Light fall perpendicularly\r\nupon a Sheet of white Paper at the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and\r\nobserved the Figure and Dimensions of the Solar Image formed on the\r\nPaper by that Light. This Image was Oblong and not Oval, but terminated\r\nwith two Rectilinear and Parallel Sides, and two Semicircular Ends. On\r\nits Sides it was bounded pretty distinctly, but on its Ends very\r\nconfusedly and indistinctly, the Light there decaying and vanishing by\r\ndegrees. The Breadth of this Image answered to the Sun's Diameter, and\r\nwas about two Inches and the eighth Part of an Inch, including the\r\nPenumbra. For the Image was eighteen Feet and an half distant from the\r\nPrism, and at this distance that Breadth, if diminished by the Diameter\r\nof the Hole in the Window-shut, that is by a quarter of an Inch,\r\nsubtended an Angle at the Prism of about half a Degree, which is the\r\nSun's apparent Diameter. But the Length of the Image was about ten\r\nInches and a quarter, and the Length of the Rectilinear Sides about\r\neight Inches; and the refracting Angle of the Prism, whereby so great a\r\nLength was made, was 64 degrees. With a less Angle the Length of the\r\nImage was less, the Breadth remaining the same. If the Prism was turned\r\nabout its Axis that way which made the Rays emerge more obliquely out of\r\nthe second refracting Surface of the Prism, the Image soon became an\r\nInch or two longer, or more; and if the Prism was turned about the\r\ncontrary way, so as to make the Rays fall more obliquely on the first\r\nrefracting Surface, the Image soon became an Inch or two shorter. And\r\ntherefore in trying this Experiment, I was as curious as I could be in\r\nplacing the Prism by the above-mention'd Rule exactly in such a Posture,\r\nthat the Refractions of the Rays at their Emergence out of the Prism\r\nmight be equal to that at their Incidence on it. This Prism had some\r\nVeins running along within the Glass from one end to the other, which\r\nscattered some of the Sun's Light irregularly, but had no sensible\r\nEffect in increasing the Length of the coloured Spectrum. For I tried\r\nthe same Experiment with other Prisms with the same Success. And\r\nparticularly with a Prism which seemed free from such Veins, and whose\r\nrefracting Angle was 62-1/2 Degrees, I found the Length of the Image\r\n9-3/4 or 10 Inches at the distance of 18-1/2 Feet from the Prism, the\r\nBreadth of the Hole in the Window-shut being 1/4 of an Inch, as before.\r\nAnd because it is easy to commit a Mistake in placing the Prism in its\r\ndue Posture, I repeated the Experiment four or five Times, and always\r\nfound the Length of the Image that which is set down above. With another\r\nPrism of clearer Glass and better Polish, which seemed free from Veins,\r\nand whose refracting Angle was 63-1/2 Degrees, the Length of this Image\r\nat the same distance of 18-1/2 Feet was also about 10 Inches, or 10-1/8.\r\nBeyond these Measures for about a 1/4 or 1/3 of an Inch at either end of\r\nthe Spectrum the Light of the Clouds seemed to be a little tinged with\r\nred and violet, but so very faintly, that I suspected that Tincture\r\nmight either wholly, or in great Measure arise from some Rays of the\r\nSpectrum scattered irregularly by some Inequalities in the Substance and\r\nPolish of the Glass, and therefore I did not include it in these\r\nMeasures. Now the different Magnitude of the hole in the Window-shut,\r\nand different thickness of the Prism where the Rays passed through it,\r\nand different inclinations of the Prism to the Horizon, made no sensible\r\nchanges in the length of the Image. Neither did the different matter of\r\nthe Prisms make any: for in a Vessel made of polished Plates of Glass\r\ncemented together in the shape of a Prism and filled with Water, there\r\nis the like Success of the Experiment according to the quantity of the\r\nRefraction. It is farther to be observed, that the Rays went on in right\r\nLines from the Prism to the Image, and therefore at their very going out\r\nof the Prism had all that Inclination to one another from which the\r\nlength of the Image proceeded, that is, the Inclination of more than two\r\ndegrees and an half. And yet according to the Laws of Opticks vulgarly\r\nreceived, they could not possibly be so much inclined to one another.[D]\r\nFor let EG [_Fig._ 13. (p. 27)] represent the Window-shut, F the hole\r\nmade therein through which a beam of the Sun's Light was transmitted\r\ninto the darkened Chamber, and ABC a Triangular Imaginary Plane whereby\r\nthe Prism is feigned to be cut transversely through the middle of the\r\nLight. Or if you please, let ABC represent the Prism it self, looking\r\ndirectly towards the Spectator's Eye with its nearer end: And let XY be\r\nthe Sun, MN the Paper upon which the Solar Image or Spectrum is cast,\r\nand PT the Image it self whose sides towards _v_ and _w_ are Rectilinear\r\nand Parallel, and ends towards P and T Semicircular. YKHP and XLJT are\r\ntwo Rays, the first of which comes from the lower part of the Sun to the\r\nhigher part of the Image, and is refracted in the Prism at K and H, and\r\nthe latter comes from the higher part of the Sun to the lower part of\r\nthe Image, and is refracted at L and J. Since the Refractions on both\r\nsides the Prism are equal to one another, that is, the Refraction at K\r\nequal to the Refraction at J, and the Refraction at L equal to the\r\nRefraction at H, so that the Refractions of the incident Rays at K and L\r\ntaken together, are equal to the Refractions of the emergent Rays at H\r\nand J taken together: it follows by adding equal things to equal things,\r\nthat the Refractions at K and H taken together, are equal to the\r\nRefractions at J and L taken together, and therefore the two Rays being\r\nequally refracted, have the same Inclination to one another after\r\nRefraction which they had before; that is, the Inclination of half a\r\nDegree answering to the Sun's Diameter. For so great was the inclination\r\nof the Rays to one another before Refraction. So then, the length of the\r\nImage PT would by the Rules of Vulgar Opticks subtend an Angle of half a\r\nDegree at the Prism, and by Consequence be equal to the breadth _vw_;\r\nand therefore the Image would be round. Thus it would be were the two\r\nRays XLJT and YKHP, and all the rest which form the Image P_w_T_v_,\r\nalike refrangible. And therefore seeing by Experience it is found that\r\nthe Image is not round, but about five times longer than broad, the Rays\r\nwhich going to the upper end P of the Image suffer the greatest\r\nRefraction, must be more refrangible than those which go to the lower\r\nend T, unless the Inequality of Refraction be casual.\r\n\r\nThis Image or Spectrum PT was coloured, being red at its least refracted\r\nend T, and violet at its most refracted end P, and yellow green and\r\nblue in the intermediate Spaces. Which agrees with the first\r\nProposition, that Lights which differ in Colour, do also differ in\r\nRefrangibility. The length of the Image in the foregoing Experiments, I\r\nmeasured from the faintest and outmost red at one end, to the faintest\r\nand outmost blue at the other end, excepting only a little Penumbra,\r\nwhose breadth scarce exceeded a quarter of an Inch, as was said above.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 4. In the Sun's Beam which was propagated into the Room through\r\nthe hole in the Window-shut, at the distance of some Feet from the hole,\r\nI held the Prism in such a Posture, that its Axis might be perpendicular\r\nto that Beam. Then I looked through the Prism upon the hole, and turning\r\nthe Prism to and fro about its Axis, to make the Image of the Hole\r\nascend and descend, when between its two contrary Motions it seemed\r\nStationary, I stopp'd the Prism, that the Refractions of both sides of\r\nthe refracting Angle might be equal to each other, as in the former\r\nExperiment. In this situation of the Prism viewing through it the said\r\nHole, I observed the length of its refracted Image to be many times\r\ngreater than its breadth, and that the most refracted part thereof\r\nappeared violet, the least refracted red, the middle parts blue, green\r\nand yellow in order. The same thing happen'd when I removed the Prism\r\nout of the Sun's Light, and looked through it upon the hole shining by\r\nthe Light of the Clouds beyond it. And yet if the Refraction were done\r\nregularly according to one certain Proportion of the Sines of Incidence\r\nand Refraction as is vulgarly supposed, the refracted Image ought to\r\nhave appeared round.\r\n\r\nSo then, by these two Experiments it appears, that in Equal Incidences\r\nthere is a considerable inequality of Refractions. But whence this\r\ninequality arises, whether it be that some of the incident Rays are\r\nrefracted more, and others less, constantly, or by chance, or that one\r\nand the same Ray is by Refraction disturbed, shatter'd, dilated, and as\r\nit were split and spread into many diverging Rays, as _Grimaldo_\r\nsupposes, does not yet appear by these Experiments, but will appear by\r\nthose that follow.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 5. Considering therefore, that if in the third Experiment the\r\nImage of the Sun should be drawn out into an oblong Form, either by a\r\nDilatation of every Ray, or by any other casual inequality of the\r\nRefractions, the same oblong Image would by a second Refraction made\r\nsideways be drawn out as much in breadth by the like Dilatation of the\r\nRays, or other casual inequality of the Refractions sideways, I tried\r\nwhat would be the Effects of such a second Refraction. For this end I\r\nordered all things as in the third Experiment, and then placed a second\r\nPrism immediately after the first in a cross Position to it, that it\r\nmight again refract the beam of the Sun's Light which came to it through\r\nthe first Prism. In the first Prism this beam was refracted upwards, and\r\nin the second sideways. And I found that by the Refraction of the second\r\nPrism, the breadth of the Image was not increased, but its superior\r\npart, which in the first Prism suffered the greater Refraction, and\r\nappeared violet and blue, did again in the second Prism suffer a greater\r\nRefraction than its inferior part, which appeared red and yellow, and\r\nthis without any Dilatation of the Image in breadth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14]\r\n\r\n_Illustration._ Let S [_Fig._ 14, 15.] represent the Sun, F the hole in\r\nthe Window, ABC the first Prism, DH the second Prism, Y the round Image\r\nof the Sun made by a direct beam of Light when the Prisms are taken\r\naway, PT the oblong Image of the Sun made by that beam passing through\r\nthe first Prism alone, when the second Prism is taken away, and _pt_ the\r\nImage made by the cross Refractions of both Prisms together. Now if the\r\nRays which tend towards the several Points of the round Image Y were\r\ndilated and spread by the Refraction of the first Prism, so that they\r\nshould not any longer go in single Lines to single Points, but that\r\nevery Ray being split, shattered, and changed from a Linear Ray to a\r\nSuperficies of Rays diverging from the Point of Refraction, and lying in\r\nthe Plane of the Angles of Incidence and Refraction, they should go in\r\nthose Planes to so many Lines reaching almost from one end of the Image\r\nPT to the other, and if that Image should thence become oblong: those\r\nRays and their several parts tending towards the several Points of the\r\nImage PT ought to be again dilated and spread sideways by the transverse\r\nRefraction of the second Prism, so as to compose a four square Image,\r\nsuch as is represented at [Greek: pt]. For the better understanding of\r\nwhich, let the Image PT be distinguished into five equal parts PQK,\r\nKQRL, LRSM, MSVN, NVT. And by the same irregularity that the orbicular\r\nLight Y is by the Refraction of the first Prism dilated and drawn out\r\ninto a long Image PT, the Light PQK which takes up a space of the same\r\nlength and breadth with the Light Y ought to be by the Refraction of the\r\nsecond Prism dilated and drawn out into the long Image _[Greek: p]qkp_,\r\nand the Light KQRL into the long Image _kqrl_, and the Lights LRSM,\r\nMSVN, NVT, into so many other long Images _lrsm_, _msvn_, _nvt[Greek:\r\nt]_; and all these long Images would compose the four square Images\r\n_[Greek: pt]_. Thus it ought to be were every Ray dilated by Refraction,\r\nand spread into a triangular Superficies of Rays diverging from the\r\nPoint of Refraction. For the second Refraction would spread the Rays one\r\nway as much as the first doth another, and so dilate the Image in\r\nbreadth as much as the first doth in length. And the same thing ought to\r\nhappen, were some rays casually refracted more than others. But the\r\nEvent is otherwise. The Image PT was not made broader by the Refraction\r\nof the second Prism, but only became oblique, as 'tis represented at\r\n_pt_, its upper end P being by the Refraction translated to a greater\r\ndistance than its lower end T. So then the Light which went towards the\r\nupper end P of the Image, was (at equal Incidences) more refracted in\r\nthe second Prism, than the Light which tended towards the lower end T,\r\nthat is the blue and violet, than the red and yellow; and therefore was\r\nmore refrangible. The same Light was by the Refraction of the first\r\nPrism translated farther from the place Y to which it tended before\r\nRefraction; and therefore suffered as well in the first Prism as in the\r\nsecond a greater Refraction than the rest of the Light, and by\r\nconsequence was more refrangible than the rest, even before its\r\nincidence on the first Prism.\r\n\r\nSometimes I placed a third Prism after the second, and sometimes also a\r\nfourth after the third, by all which the Image might be often refracted\r\nsideways: but the Rays which were more refracted than the rest in the\r\nfirst Prism were also more refracted in all the rest, and that without\r\nany Dilatation of the Image sideways: and therefore those Rays for their\r\nconstancy of a greater Refraction are deservedly reputed more\r\nrefrangible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15]\r\n\r\nBut that the meaning of this Experiment may more clearly appear, it is\r\nto be considered that the Rays which are equally refrangible do fall\r\nupon a Circle answering to the Sun's Disque. For this was proved in the\r\nthird Experiment. By a Circle I understand not here a perfect\r\ngeometrical Circle, but any orbicular Figure whose length is equal to\r\nits breadth, and which, as to Sense, may seem circular. Let therefore AG\r\n[in _Fig._ 15.] represent the Circle which all the most refrangible Rays\r\npropagated from the whole Disque of the Sun, would illuminate and paint\r\nupon the opposite Wall if they were alone; EL the Circle which all the\r\nleast refrangible Rays would in like manner illuminate and paint if they\r\nwere alone; BH, CJ, DK, the Circles which so many intermediate sorts of\r\nRays would successively paint upon the Wall, if they were singly\r\npropagated from the Sun in successive order, the rest being always\r\nintercepted; and conceive that there are other intermediate Circles\r\nwithout Number, which innumerable other intermediate sorts of Rays would\r\nsuccessively paint upon the Wall if the Sun should successively emit\r\nevery sort apart. And seeing the Sun emits all these sorts at once, they\r\nmust all together illuminate and paint innumerable equal Circles, of all\r\nwhich, being according to their degrees of Refrangibility placed in\r\norder in a continual Series, that oblong Spectrum PT is composed which I\r\ndescribed in the third Experiment. Now if the Sun's circular Image Y [in\r\n_Fig._ 15.] which is made by an unrefracted beam of Light was by any\r\nDilation of the single Rays, or by any other irregularity in the\r\nRefraction of the first Prism, converted into the oblong Spectrum, PT:\r\nthen ought every Circle AG, BH, CJ, &c. in that Spectrum, by the cross\r\nRefraction of the second Prism again dilating or otherwise scattering\r\nthe Rays as before, to be in like manner drawn out and transformed into\r\nan oblong Figure, and thereby the breadth of the Image PT would be now\r\nas much augmented as the length of the Image Y was before by the\r\nRefraction of the first Prism; and thus by the Refractions of both\r\nPrisms together would be formed a four square Figure _p[Greek:\r\np]t[Greek: t]_, as I described above. Wherefore since the breadth of the\r\nSpectrum PT is not increased by the Refraction sideways, it is certain\r\nthat the Rays are not split or dilated, or otherways irregularly\r\nscatter'd by that Refraction, but that every Circle is by a regular and\r\nuniform Refraction translated entire into another Place, as the Circle\r\nAG by the greatest Refraction into the place _ag_, the Circle BH by a\r\nless Refraction into the place _bh_, the Circle CJ by a Refraction still\r\nless into the place _ci_, and so of the rest; by which means a new\r\nSpectrum _pt_ inclined to the former PT is in like manner composed of\r\nCircles lying in a right Line; and these Circles must be of the same\r\nbigness with the former, because the breadths of all the Spectrums Y, PT\r\nand _pt_ at equal distances from the Prisms are equal.\r\n\r\nI considered farther, that by the breadth of the hole F through which\r\nthe Light enters into the dark Chamber, there is a Penumbra made in the\r\nCircuit of the Spectrum Y, and that Penumbra remains in the rectilinear\r\nSides of the Spectrums PT and _pt_. I placed therefore at that hole a\r\nLens or Object-glass of a Telescope which might cast the Image of the\r\nSun distinctly on Y without any Penumbra at all, and found that the\r\nPenumbra of the rectilinear Sides of the oblong Spectrums PT and _pt_\r\nwas also thereby taken away, so that those Sides appeared as distinctly\r\ndefined as did the Circumference of the first Image Y. Thus it happens\r\nif the Glass of the Prisms be free from Veins, and their sides be\r\naccurately plane and well polished without those numberless Waves or\r\nCurles which usually arise from Sand-holes a little smoothed in\r\npolishing with Putty. If the Glass be only well polished and free from\r\nVeins, and the Sides not accurately plane, but a little Convex or\r\nConcave, as it frequently happens; yet may the three Spectrums Y, PT and\r\n_pt_ want Penumbras, but not in equal distances from the Prisms. Now\r\nfrom this want of Penumbras, I knew more certainly that every one of the\r\nCircles was refracted according to some most regular, uniform and\r\nconstant Law. For if there were any irregularity in the Refraction, the\r\nright Lines AE and GL, which all the Circles in the Spectrum PT do\r\ntouch, could not by that Refraction be translated into the Lines _ae_\r\nand _gl_ as distinct and straight as they were before, but there would\r\narise in those translated Lines some Penumbra or Crookedness or\r\nUndulation, or other sensible Perturbation contrary to what is found by\r\nExperience. Whatsoever Penumbra or Perturbation should be made in the\r\nCircles by the cross Refraction of the second Prism, all that Penumbra\r\nor Perturbation would be conspicuous in the right Lines _ae_ and _gl_\r\nwhich touch those Circles. And therefore since there is no such Penumbra\r\nor Perturbation in those right Lines, there must be none in the\r\nCircles. Since the distance between those Tangents or breadth of the\r\nSpectrum is not increased by the Refractions, the Diameters of the\r\nCircles are not increased thereby. Since those Tangents continue to be\r\nright Lines, every Circle which in the first Prism is more or less\r\nrefracted, is exactly in the same proportion more or less refracted in\r\nthe second. And seeing all these things continue to succeed after the\r\nsame manner when the Rays are again in a third Prism, and again in a\r\nfourth refracted sideways, it is evident that the Rays of one and the\r\nsame Circle, as to their degree of Refrangibility, continue always\r\nuniform and homogeneal to one another, and that those of several Circles\r\ndo differ in degree of Refrangibility, and that in some certain and\r\nconstant Proportion. Which is the thing I was to prove.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another Circumstance or two of this Experiment by which it\r\nbecomes still more plain and convincing. Let the second Prism DH [in\r\n_Fig._ 16.] be placed not immediately after the first, but at some\r\ndistance from it; suppose in the mid-way between it and the Wall on\r\nwhich the oblong Spectrum PT is cast, so that the Light from the first\r\nPrism may fall upon it in the form of an oblong Spectrum [Greek: pt]\r\nparallel to this second Prism, and be refracted sideways to form the\r\noblong Spectrum _pt_ upon the Wall. And you will find as before, that\r\nthis Spectrum _pt_ is inclined to that Spectrum PT, which the first\r\nPrism forms alone without the second; the blue ends P and _p_ being\r\nfarther distant from one another than the red ones T and _t_, and by\r\nconsequence that the Rays which go to the blue end [Greek: p] of the\r\nImage [Greek: pt], and which therefore suffer the greatest Refraction in\r\nthe first Prism, are again in the second Prism more refracted than the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe same thing I try'd also by letting the Sun's Light into a dark Room\r\nthrough two little round holes F and [Greek: ph] [in _Fig._ 17.] made in\r\nthe Window, and with two parallel Prisms ABC and [Greek: abg] placed at\r\nthose holes (one at each) refracting those two beams of Light to the\r\nopposite Wall of the Chamber, in such manner that the two colour'd\r\nImages PT and MN which they there painted were joined end to end and lay\r\nin one straight Line, the red end T of the one touching the blue end M\r\nof the other. For if these two refracted Beams were again by a third\r\nPrism DH placed cross to the two first, refracted sideways, and the\r\nSpectrums thereby translated to some other part of the Wall of the\r\nChamber, suppose the Spectrum PT to _pt_ and the Spectrum MN to _mn_,\r\nthese translated Spectrums _pt_ and _mn_ would not lie in one straight\r\nLine with their ends contiguous as before, but be broken off from one\r\nanother and become parallel, the blue end _m_ of the Image _mn_ being by\r\na greater Refraction translated farther from its former place MT, than\r\nthe red end _t_ of the other Image _pt_ from the same place MT; which\r\nputs the Proposition past Dispute. And this happens whether the third\r\nPrism DH be placed immediately after the two first, or at a great\r\ndistance from them, so that the Light refracted in the two first Prisms\r\nbe either white and circular, or coloured and oblong when it falls on\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 6. In the middle of two thin Boards I made round holes a third\r\npart of an Inch in diameter, and in the Window-shut a much broader hole\r\nbeing made to let into my darkned Chamber a large Beam of the Sun's\r\nLight; I placed a Prism behind the Shut in that beam to refract it\r\ntowards the opposite Wall, and close behind the Prism I fixed one of the\r\nBoards, in such manner that the middle of the refracted Light might pass\r\nthrough the hole made in it, and the rest be intercepted by the Board.\r\nThen at the distance of about twelve Feet from the first Board I fixed\r\nthe other Board in such manner that the middle of the refracted Light\r\nwhich came through the hole in the first Board, and fell upon the\r\nopposite Wall, might pass through the hole in this other Board, and the\r\nrest being intercepted by the Board might paint upon it the coloured\r\nSpectrum of the Sun. And close behind this Board I fixed another Prism\r\nto refract the Light which came through the hole. Then I returned\r\nspeedily to the first Prism, and by turning it slowly to and fro about\r\nits Axis, I caused the Image which fell upon the second Board to move up\r\nand down upon that Board, that all its parts might successively pass\r\nthrough the hole in that Board and fall upon the Prism behind it. And in\r\nthe mean time, I noted the places on the opposite Wall to which that\r\nLight after its Refraction in the second Prism did pass; and by the\r\ndifference of the places I found that the Light which being most\r\nrefracted in the first Prism did go to the blue end of the Image, was\r\nagain more refracted in the second Prism than the Light which went to\r\nthe red end of that Image, which proves as well the first Proposition as\r\nthe second. And this happened whether the Axis of the two Prisms were\r\nparallel, or inclined to one another, and to the Horizon in any given\r\nAngles.\r\n\r\n_Illustration._ Let F [in _Fig._ 18.] be the wide hole in the\r\nWindow-shut, through which the Sun shines upon the first Prism ABC, and\r\nlet the refracted Light fall upon the middle of the Board DE, and the\r\nmiddle part of that Light upon the hole G made in the middle part of\r\nthat Board. Let this trajected part of that Light fall again upon the\r\nmiddle of the second Board _de_, and there paint such an oblong coloured\r\nImage of the Sun as was described in the third Experiment. By turning\r\nthe Prism ABC slowly to and fro about its Axis, this Image will be made\r\nto move up and down the Board _de_, and by this means all its parts from\r\none end to the other may be made to pass successively through the hole\r\n_g_ which is made in the middle of that Board. In the mean while another\r\nPrism _abc_ is to be fixed next after that hole _g_, to refract the\r\ntrajected Light a second time. And these things being thus ordered, I\r\nmarked the places M and N of the opposite Wall upon which the refracted\r\nLight fell, and found that whilst the two Boards and second Prism\r\nremained unmoved, those places by turning the first Prism about its Axis\r\nwere changed perpetually. For when the lower part of the Light which\r\nfell upon the second Board _de_ was cast through the hole _g_, it went\r\nto a lower place M on the Wall and when the higher part of that Light\r\nwas cast through the same hole _g_, it went to a higher place N on the\r\nWall, and when any intermediate part of the Light was cast through that\r\nhole, it went to some place on the Wall between M and N. The unchanged\r\nPosition of the holes in the Boards, made the Incidence of the Rays upon\r\nthe second Prism to be the same in all cases. And yet in that common\r\nIncidence some of the Rays were more refracted, and others less. And\r\nthose were more refracted in this Prism, which by a greater Refraction\r\nin the first Prism were more turned out of the way, and therefore for\r\ntheir Constancy of being more refracted are deservedly called more\r\nrefrangible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 7. At two holes made near one another in my Window-shut I\r\nplaced two Prisms, one at each, which might cast upon the opposite Wall\r\n(after the manner of the third Experiment) two oblong coloured Images of\r\nthe Sun. And at a little distance from the Wall I placed a long slender\r\nPaper with straight and parallel edges, and ordered the Prisms and Paper\r\nso, that the red Colour of one Image might fall directly upon one half\r\nof the Paper, and the violet Colour of the other Image upon the other\r\nhalf of the same Paper; so that the Paper appeared of two Colours, red\r\nand violet, much after the manner of the painted Paper in the first and\r\nsecond Experiments. Then with a black Cloth I covered the Wall behind\r\nthe Paper, that no Light might be reflected from it to disturb the\r\nExperiment, and viewing the Paper through a third Prism held parallel\r\nto it, I saw that half of it which was illuminated by the violet Light\r\nto be divided from the other half by a greater Refraction, especially\r\nwhen I went a good way off from the Paper. For when I viewed it too near\r\nat hand, the two halfs of the Paper did not appear fully divided from\r\none another, but seemed contiguous at one of their Angles like the\r\npainted Paper in the first Experiment. Which also happened when the\r\nPaper was too broad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nSometimes instead of the Paper I used a white Thred, and this appeared\r\nthrough the Prism divided into two parallel Threds as is represented in\r\nthe nineteenth Figure, where DG denotes the Thred illuminated with\r\nviolet Light from D to E and with red Light from F to G, and _defg_ are\r\nthe parts of the Thred seen by Refraction. If one half of the Thred be\r\nconstantly illuminated with red, and the other half be illuminated with\r\nall the Colours successively, (which may be done by causing one of the\r\nPrisms to be turned about its Axis whilst the other remains unmoved)\r\nthis other half in viewing the Thred through the Prism, will appear in\r\na continual right Line with the first half when illuminated with red,\r\nand begin to be a little divided from it when illuminated with Orange,\r\nand remove farther from it when illuminated with yellow, and still\r\nfarther when with green, and farther when with blue, and go yet farther\r\noff when illuminated with Indigo, and farthest when with deep violet.\r\nWhich plainly shews, that the Lights of several Colours are more and\r\nmore refrangible one than another, in this Order of their Colours, red,\r\norange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, deep violet; and so proves as well\r\nthe first Proposition as the second.\r\n\r\nI caused also the coloured Spectrums PT [in _Fig._ 17.] and MN made in a\r\ndark Chamber by the Refractions of two Prisms to lie in a Right Line end\r\nto end, as was described above in the fifth Experiment, and viewing them\r\nthrough a third Prism held parallel to their Length, they appeared no\r\nlonger in a Right Line, but became broken from one another, as they are\r\nrepresented at _pt_ and _mn_, the violet end _m_ of the Spectrum _mn_\r\nbeing by a greater Refraction translated farther from its former Place\r\nMT than the red end _t_ of the other Spectrum _pt_.\r\n\r\nI farther caused those two Spectrums PT [in _Fig._ 20.] and MN to become\r\nco-incident in an inverted Order of their Colours, the red end of each\r\nfalling on the violet end of the other, as they are represented in the\r\noblong Figure PTMN; and then viewing them through a Prism DH held\r\nparallel to their Length, they appeared not co-incident, as when view'd\r\nwith the naked Eye, but in the form of two distinct Spectrums _pt_ and\r\n_mn_ crossing one another in the middle after the manner of the Letter\r\nX. Which shews that the red of the one Spectrum and violet of the other,\r\nwhich were co-incident at PN and MT, being parted from one another by a\r\ngreater Refraction of the violet to _p_ and _m_ than of the red to _n_\r\nand _t_, do differ in degrees of Refrangibility.\r\n\r\nI illuminated also a little Circular Piece of white Paper all over with\r\nthe Lights of both Prisms intermixed, and when it was illuminated with\r\nthe red of one Spectrum, and deep violet of the other, so as by the\r\nMixture of those Colours to appear all over purple, I viewed the Paper,\r\nfirst at a less distance, and then at a greater, through a third Prism;\r\nand as I went from the Paper, the refracted Image thereof became more\r\nand more divided by the unequal Refraction of the two mixed Colours, and\r\nat length parted into two distinct Images, a red one and a violet one,\r\nwhereof the violet was farthest from the Paper, and therefore suffered\r\nthe greatest Refraction. And when that Prism at the Window, which cast\r\nthe violet on the Paper was taken away, the violet Image disappeared;\r\nbut when the other Prism was taken away the red vanished; which shews,\r\nthat these two Images were nothing else than the Lights of the two\r\nPrisms, which had been intermixed on the purple Paper, but were parted\r\nagain by their unequal Refractions made in the third Prism, through\r\nwhich the Paper was view'd. This also was observable, that if one of the\r\nPrisms at the Window, suppose that which cast the violet on the Paper,\r\nwas turned about its Axis to make all the Colours in this order,\r\nviolet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, fall successively on\r\nthe Paper from that Prism, the violet Image changed Colour accordingly,\r\nturning successively to indigo, blue, green, yellow and red, and in\r\nchanging Colour came nearer and nearer to the red Image made by the\r\nother Prism, until when it was also red both Images became fully\r\nco-incident.\r\n\r\nI placed also two Paper Circles very near one another, the one in the\r\nred Light of one Prism, and the other in the violet Light of the other.\r\nThe Circles were each of them an Inch in diameter, and behind them the\r\nWall was dark, that the Experiment might not be disturbed by any Light\r\ncoming from thence. These Circles thus illuminated, I viewed through a\r\nPrism, so held, that the Refraction might be made towards the red\r\nCircle, and as I went from them they came nearer and nearer together,\r\nand at length became co-incident; and afterwards when I went still\r\nfarther off, they parted again in a contrary Order, the violet by a\r\ngreater Refraction being carried beyond the red.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 8. In Summer, when the Sun's Light uses to be strongest, I\r\nplaced a Prism at the Hole of the Window-shut, as in the third\r\nExperiment, yet so that its Axis might be parallel to the Axis of the\r\nWorld, and at the opposite Wall in the Sun's refracted Light, I placed\r\nan open Book. Then going six Feet and two Inches from the Book, I placed\r\nthere the above-mentioned Lens, by which the Light reflected from the\r\nBook might be made to converge and meet again at the distance of six\r\nFeet and two Inches behind the Lens, and there paint the Species of the\r\nBook upon a Sheet of white Paper much after the manner of the second\r\nExperiment. The Book and Lens being made fast, I noted the Place where\r\nthe Paper was, when the Letters of the Book, illuminated by the fullest\r\nred Light of the Solar Image falling upon it, did cast their Species on\r\nthat Paper most distinctly: And then I stay'd till by the Motion of the\r\nSun, and consequent Motion of his Image on the Book, all the Colours\r\nfrom that red to the middle of the blue pass'd over those Letters; and\r\nwhen those Letters were illuminated by that blue, I noted again the\r\nPlace of the Paper when they cast their Species most distinctly upon it:\r\nAnd I found that this last Place of the Paper was nearer to the Lens\r\nthan its former Place by about two Inches and an half, or two and three\r\nquarters. So much sooner therefore did the Light in the violet end of\r\nthe Image by a greater Refraction converge and meet, than the Light in\r\nthe red end. But in trying this, the Chamber was as dark as I could make\r\nit. For, if these Colours be diluted and weakned by the Mixture of any\r\nadventitious Light, the distance between the Places of the Paper will\r\nnot be so great. This distance in the second Experiment, where the\r\nColours of natural Bodies were made use of, was but an Inch and an half,\r\nby reason of the Imperfection of those Colours. Here in the Colours of\r\nthe Prism, which are manifestly more full, intense, and lively than\r\nthose of natural Bodies, the distance is two Inches and three quarters.\r\nAnd were the Colours still more full, I question not but that the\r\ndistance would be considerably greater. For the coloured Light of the\r\nPrism, by the interfering of the Circles described in the second Figure\r\nof the fifth Experiment, and also by the Light of the very bright Clouds\r\nnext the Sun's Body intermixing with these Colours, and by the Light\r\nscattered by the Inequalities in the Polish of the Prism, was so very\r\nmuch compounded, that the Species which those faint and dark Colours,\r\nthe indigo and violet, cast upon the Paper were not distinct enough to\r\nbe well observed.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 9. A Prism, whose two Angles at its Base were equal to one\r\nanother, and half right ones, and the third a right one, I placed in a\r\nBeam of the Sun's Light let into a dark Chamber through a Hole in the\r\nWindow-shut, as in the third Experiment. And turning the Prism slowly\r\nabout its Axis, until all the Light which went through one of its\r\nAngles, and was refracted by it began to be reflected by its Base, at\r\nwhich till then it went out of the Glass, I observed that those Rays\r\nwhich had suffered the greatest Refraction were sooner reflected than\r\nthe rest. I conceived therefore, that those Rays of the reflected Light,\r\nwhich were most refrangible, did first of all by a total Reflexion\r\nbecome more copious in that Light than the rest, and that afterwards the\r\nrest also, by a total Reflexion, became as copious as these. To try\r\nthis, I made the reflected Light pass through another Prism, and being\r\nrefracted by it to fall afterwards upon a Sheet of white Paper placed\r\nat some distance behind it, and there by that Refraction to paint the\r\nusual Colours of the Prism. And then causing the first Prism to be\r\nturned about its Axis as above, I observed that when those Rays, which\r\nin this Prism had suffered the greatest Refraction, and appeared of a\r\nblue and violet Colour began to be totally reflected, the blue and\r\nviolet Light on the Paper, which was most refracted in the second Prism,\r\nreceived a sensible Increase above that of the red and yellow, which was\r\nleast refracted; and afterwards, when the rest of the Light which was\r\ngreen, yellow, and red, began to be totally reflected in the first\r\nPrism, the Light of those Colours on the Paper received as great an\r\nIncrease as the violet and blue had done before. Whence 'tis manifest,\r\nthat the Beam of Light reflected by the Base of the Prism, being\r\naugmented first by the more refrangible Rays, and afterwards by the less\r\nrefrangible ones, is compounded of Rays differently refrangible. And\r\nthat all such reflected Light is of the same Nature with the Sun's Light\r\nbefore its Incidence on the Base of the Prism, no Man ever doubted; it\r\nbeing generally allowed, that Light by such Reflexions suffers no\r\nAlteration in its Modifications and Properties. I do not here take\r\nNotice of any Refractions made in the sides of the first Prism, because\r\nthe Light enters it perpendicularly at the first side, and goes out\r\nperpendicularly at the second side, and therefore suffers none. So then,\r\nthe Sun's incident Light being of the same Temper and Constitution with\r\nhis emergent Light, and the last being compounded of Rays differently\r\nrefrangible, the first must be in like manner compounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\n_Illustration._ In the twenty-first Figure, ABC is the first Prism, BC\r\nits Base, B and C its equal Angles at the Base, each of 45 Degrees, A\r\nits rectangular Vertex, FM a beam of the Sun's Light let into a dark\r\nRoom through a hole F one third part of an Inch broad, M its Incidence\r\non the Base of the Prism, MG a less refracted Ray, MH a more refracted\r\nRay, MN the beam of Light reflected from the Base, VXY the second Prism\r\nby which this beam in passing through it is refracted, N_t_ the less\r\nrefracted Light of this beam, and N_p_ the more refracted part thereof.\r\nWhen the first Prism ABC is turned about its Axis according to the order\r\nof the Letters ABC, the Rays MH emerge more and more obliquely out of\r\nthat Prism, and at length after their most oblique Emergence are\r\nreflected towards N, and going on to _p_ do increase the Number of the\r\nRays N_p_. Afterwards by continuing the Motion of the first Prism, the\r\nRays MG are also reflected to N and increase the number of the Rays\r\nN_t_. And therefore the Light MN admits into its Composition, first the\r\nmore refrangible Rays, and then the less refrangible Rays, and yet after\r\nthis Composition is of the same Nature with the Sun's immediate Light\r\nFM, the Reflexion of the specular Base BC causing no Alteration therein.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 10. Two Prisms, which were alike in Shape, I tied so together,\r\nthat their Axis and opposite Sides being parallel, they composed a\r\nParallelopiped. And, the Sun shining into my dark Chamber through a\r\nlittle hole in the Window-shut, I placed that Parallelopiped in his beam\r\nat some distance from the hole, in such a Posture, that the Axes of the\r\nPrisms might be perpendicular to the incident Rays, and that those Rays\r\nbeing incident upon the first Side of one Prism, might go on through the\r\ntwo contiguous Sides of both Prisms, and emerge out of the last Side of\r\nthe second Prism. This Side being parallel to the first Side of the\r\nfirst Prism, caused the emerging Light to be parallel to the incident.\r\nThen, beyond these two Prisms I placed a third, which might refract that\r\nemergent Light, and by that Refraction cast the usual Colours of the\r\nPrism upon the opposite Wall, or upon a sheet of white Paper held at a\r\nconvenient Distance behind the Prism for that refracted Light to fall\r\nupon it. After this I turned the Parallelopiped about its Axis, and\r\nfound that when the contiguous Sides of the two Prisms became so oblique\r\nto the incident Rays, that those Rays began all of them to be\r\nreflected, those Rays which in the third Prism had suffered the greatest\r\nRefraction, and painted the Paper with violet and blue, were first of\r\nall by a total Reflexion taken out of the transmitted Light, the rest\r\nremaining and on the Paper painting their Colours of green, yellow,\r\norange and red, as before; and afterwards by continuing the Motion of\r\nthe two Prisms, the rest of the Rays also by a total Reflexion vanished\r\nin order, according to their degrees of Refrangibility. The Light\r\ntherefore which emerged out of the two Prisms is compounded of Rays\r\ndifferently refrangible, seeing the more refrangible Rays may be taken\r\nout of it, while the less refrangible remain. But this Light being\r\ntrajected only through the parallel Superficies of the two Prisms, if it\r\nsuffer'd any change by the Refraction of one Superficies it lost that\r\nImpression by the contrary Refraction of the other Superficies, and so\r\nbeing restor'd to its pristine Constitution, became of the same Nature\r\nand Condition as at first before its Incidence on those Prisms; and\r\ntherefore, before its Incidence, was as much compounded of Rays\r\ndifferently refrangible, as afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\n_Illustration._ In the twenty second Figure ABC and BCD are the two\r\nPrisms tied together in the form of a Parallelopiped, their Sides BC and\r\nCB being contiguous, and their Sides AB and CD parallel. And HJK is the\r\nthird Prism, by which the Sun's Light propagated through the hole F into\r\nthe dark Chamber, and there passing through those sides of the Prisms\r\nAB, BC, CB and CD, is refracted at O to the white Paper PT, falling\r\nthere partly upon P by a greater Refraction, partly upon T by a less\r\nRefraction, and partly upon R and other intermediate places by\r\nintermediate Refractions. By turning the Parallelopiped ACBD about its\r\nAxis, according to the order of the Letters A, C, D, B, at length when\r\nthe contiguous Planes BC and CB become sufficiently oblique to the Rays\r\nFM, which are incident upon them at M, there will vanish totally out of\r\nthe refracted Light OPT, first of all the most refracted Rays OP, (the\r\nrest OR and OT remaining as before) then the Rays OR and other\r\nintermediate ones, and lastly, the least refracted Rays OT. For when\r\nthe Plane BC becomes sufficiently oblique to the Rays incident upon it,\r\nthose Rays will begin to be totally reflected by it towards N; and first\r\nthe most refrangible Rays will be totally reflected (as was explained in\r\nthe preceding Experiment) and by Consequence must first disappear at P,\r\nand afterwards the rest as they are in order totally reflected to N,\r\nthey must disappear in the same order at R and T. So then the Rays which\r\nat O suffer the greatest Refraction, may be taken out of the Light MO\r\nwhilst the rest of the Rays remain in it, and therefore that Light MO is\r\ncompounded of Rays differently refrangible. And because the Planes AB\r\nand CD are parallel, and therefore by equal and contrary Refractions\r\ndestroy one anothers Effects, the incident Light FM must be of the same\r\nKind and Nature with the emergent Light MO, and therefore doth also\r\nconsist of Rays differently refrangible. These two Lights FM and MO,\r\nbefore the most refrangible Rays are separated out of the emergent Light\r\nMO, agree in Colour, and in all other Properties so far as my\r\nObservation reaches, and therefore are deservedly reputed of the same\r\nNature and Constitution, and by Consequence the one is compounded as\r\nwell as the other. But after the most refrangible Rays begin to be\r\ntotally reflected, and thereby separated out of the emergent Light MO,\r\nthat Light changes its Colour from white to a dilute and faint yellow, a\r\npretty good orange, a very full red successively, and then totally\r\nvanishes. For after the most refrangible Rays which paint the Paper at\r\nP with a purple Colour, are by a total Reflexion taken out of the beam\r\nof Light MO, the rest of the Colours which appear on the Paper at R and\r\nT being mix'd in the Light MO compound there a faint yellow, and after\r\nthe blue and part of the green which appear on the Paper between P and R\r\nare taken away, the rest which appear between R and T (that is the\r\nyellow, orange, red and a little green) being mixed in the beam MO\r\ncompound there an orange; and when all the Rays are by Reflexion taken\r\nout of the beam MO, except the least refrangible, which at T appear of a\r\nfull red, their Colour is the same in that beam MO as afterwards at T,\r\nthe Refraction of the Prism HJK serving only to separate the differently\r\nrefrangible Rays, without making any Alteration in their Colours, as\r\nshall be more fully proved hereafter. All which confirms as well the\r\nfirst Proposition as the second.\r\n\r\n_Scholium._ If this Experiment and the former be conjoined and made one\r\nby applying a fourth Prism VXY [in _Fig._ 22.] to refract the reflected\r\nbeam MN towards _tp_, the Conclusion will be clearer. For then the Light\r\nN_p_ which in the fourth Prism is more refracted, will become fuller and\r\nstronger when the Light OP, which in the third Prism HJK is more\r\nrefracted, vanishes at P; and afterwards when the less refracted Light\r\nOT vanishes at T, the less refracted Light N_t_ will become increased\r\nwhilst the more refracted Light at _p_ receives no farther increase. And\r\nas the trajected beam MO in vanishing is always of such a Colour as\r\nought to result from the mixture of the Colours which fall upon the\r\nPaper PT, so is the reflected beam MN always of such a Colour as ought\r\nto result from the mixture of the Colours which fall upon the Paper\r\n_pt_. For when the most refrangible Rays are by a total Reflexion taken\r\nout of the beam MO, and leave that beam of an orange Colour, the Excess\r\nof those Rays in the reflected Light, does not only make the violet,\r\nindigo and blue at _p_ more full, but also makes the beam MN change from\r\nthe yellowish Colour of the Sun's Light, to a pale white inclining to\r\nblue, and afterward recover its yellowish Colour again, so soon as all\r\nthe rest of the transmitted Light MOT is reflected.\r\n\r\nNow seeing that in all this variety of Experiments, whether the Trial be\r\nmade in Light reflected, and that either from natural Bodies, as in the\r\nfirst and second Experiment, or specular, as in the ninth; or in Light\r\nrefracted, and that either before the unequally refracted Rays are by\r\ndiverging separated from one another, and losing their whiteness which\r\nthey have altogether, appear severally of several Colours, as in the\r\nfifth Experiment; or after they are separated from one another, and\r\nappear colour'd as in the sixth, seventh, and eighth Experiments; or in\r\nLight trajected through parallel Superficies, destroying each others\r\nEffects, as in the tenth Experiment; there are always found Rays, which\r\nat equal Incidences on the same Medium suffer unequal Refractions, and\r\nthat without any splitting or dilating of single Rays, or contingence in\r\nthe inequality of the Refractions, as is proved in the fifth and sixth\r\nExperiments. And seeing the Rays which differ in Refrangibility may be\r\nparted and sorted from one another, and that either by Refraction as in\r\nthe third Experiment, or by Reflexion as in the tenth, and then the\r\nseveral sorts apart at equal Incidences suffer unequal Refractions, and\r\nthose sorts are more refracted than others after Separation, which were\r\nmore refracted before it, as in the sixth and following Experiments, and\r\nif the Sun's Light be trajected through three or more cross Prisms\r\nsuccessively, those Rays which in the first Prism are refracted more\r\nthan others, are in all the following Prisms refracted more than others\r\nin the same Rate and Proportion, as appears by the fifth Experiment;\r\nit's manifest that the Sun's Light is an heterogeneous Mixture of Rays,\r\nsome of which are constantly more refrangible than others, as was\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ III. THEOR. III.\r\n\r\n_The Sun's Light consists of Rays differing in Reflexibility, and those\r\nRays are more reflexible than others which are more refrangible._\r\n\r\nThis is manifest by the ninth and tenth Experiments: For in the ninth\r\nExperiment, by turning the Prism about its Axis, until the Rays within\r\nit which in going out into the Air were refracted by its Base, became so\r\noblique to that Base, as to begin to be totally reflected thereby; those\r\nRays became first of all totally reflected, which before at equal\r\nIncidences with the rest had suffered the greatest Refraction. And the\r\nsame thing happens in the Reflexion made by the common Base of the two\r\nPrisms in the tenth Experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ IV. PROB. I.\r\n\r\n_To separate from one another the heterogeneous Rays of compound Light._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe heterogeneous Rays are in some measure separated from one another by\r\nthe Refraction of the Prism in the third Experiment, and in the fifth\r\nExperiment, by taking away the Penumbra from the rectilinear sides of\r\nthe coloured Image, that Separation in those very rectilinear sides or\r\nstraight edges of the Image becomes perfect. But in all places between\r\nthose rectilinear edges, those innumerable Circles there described,\r\nwhich are severally illuminated by homogeneal Rays, by interfering with\r\none another, and being every where commix'd, do render the Light\r\nsufficiently compound. But if these Circles, whilst their Centers keep\r\ntheir Distances and Positions, could be made less in Diameter, their\r\ninterfering one with another, and by Consequence the Mixture of the\r\nheterogeneous Rays would be proportionally diminish'd. In the twenty\r\nthird Figure let AG, BH, CJ, DK, EL, FM be the Circles which so many\r\nsorts of Rays flowing from the same disque of the Sun, do in the third\r\nExperiment illuminate; of all which and innumerable other intermediate\r\nones lying in a continual Series between the two rectilinear and\r\nparallel edges of the Sun's oblong Image PT, that Image is compos'd, as\r\nwas explained in the fifth Experiment. And let _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, _dk_,\r\n_el_, _fm_ be so many less Circles lying in a like continual Series\r\nbetween two parallel right Lines _af_ and _gm_ with the same distances\r\nbetween their Centers, and illuminated by the same sorts of Rays, that\r\nis the Circle _ag_ with the same sort by which the corresponding Circle\r\nAG was illuminated, and the Circle _bh_ with the same sort by which the\r\ncorresponding Circle BH was illuminated, and the rest of the Circles\r\n_ci_, _dk_, _el_, _fm_ respectively, with the same sorts of Rays by\r\nwhich the several corresponding Circles CJ, DK, EL, FM were illuminated.\r\nIn the Figure PT composed of the greater Circles, three of those Circles\r\nAG, BH, CJ, are so expanded into one another, that the three sorts of\r\nRays by which those Circles are illuminated, together with other\r\ninnumerable sorts of intermediate Rays, are mixed at QR in the middle\r\nof the Circle BH. And the like Mixture happens throughout almost the\r\nwhole length of the Figure PT. But in the Figure _pt_ composed of the\r\nless Circles, the three less Circles _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, which answer to\r\nthose three greater, do not extend into one another; nor are there any\r\nwhere mingled so much as any two of the three sorts of Rays by which\r\nthose Circles are illuminated, and which in the Figure PT are all of\r\nthem intermingled at BH.\r\n\r\nNow he that shall thus consider it, will easily understand that the\r\nMixture is diminished in the same Proportion with the Diameters of the\r\nCircles. If the Diameters of the Circles whilst their Centers remain the\r\nsame, be made three times less than before, the Mixture will be also\r\nthree times less; if ten times less, the Mixture will be ten times less,\r\nand so of other Proportions. That is, the Mixture of the Rays in the\r\ngreater Figure PT will be to their Mixture in the less _pt_, as the\r\nLatitude of the greater Figure is to the Latitude of the less. For the\r\nLatitudes of these Figures are equal to the Diameters of their Circles.\r\nAnd hence it easily follows, that the Mixture of the Rays in the\r\nrefracted Spectrum _pt_ is to the Mixture of the Rays in the direct and\r\nimmediate Light of the Sun, as the breadth of that Spectrum is to the\r\ndifference between the length and breadth of the same Spectrum.\r\n\r\nSo then, if we would diminish the Mixture of the Rays, we are to\r\ndiminish the Diameters of the Circles. Now these would be diminished if\r\nthe Sun's Diameter to which they answer could be made less than it is,\r\nor (which comes to the same Purpose) if without Doors, at a great\r\ndistance from the Prism towards the Sun, some opake Body were placed,\r\nwith a round hole in the middle of it, to intercept all the Sun's Light,\r\nexcepting so much as coming from the middle of his Body could pass\r\nthrough that Hole to the Prism. For so the Circles AG, BH, and the rest,\r\nwould not any longer answer to the whole Disque of the Sun, but only to\r\nthat Part of it which could be seen from the Prism through that Hole,\r\nthat it is to the apparent Magnitude of that Hole view'd from the Prism.\r\nBut that these Circles may answer more distinctly to that Hole, a Lens\r\nis to be placed by the Prism to cast the Image of the Hole, (that is,\r\nevery one of the Circles AG, BH, &c.) distinctly upon the Paper at PT,\r\nafter such a manner, as by a Lens placed at a Window, the Species of\r\nObjects abroad are cast distinctly upon a Paper within the Room, and the\r\nrectilinear Sides of the oblong Solar Image in the fifth Experiment\r\nbecame distinct without any Penumbra. If this be done, it will not be\r\nnecessary to place that Hole very far off, no not beyond the Window. And\r\ntherefore instead of that Hole, I used the Hole in the Window-shut, as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 11. In the Sun's Light let into my darken'd Chamber through a\r\nsmall round Hole in my Window-shut, at about ten or twelve Feet from the\r\nWindow, I placed a Lens, by which the Image of the Hole might be\r\ndistinctly cast upon a Sheet of white Paper, placed at the distance of\r\nsix, eight, ten, or twelve Feet from the Lens. For, according to the\r\ndifference of the Lenses I used various distances, which I think not\r\nworth the while to describe. Then immediately after the Lens I placed a\r\nPrism, by which the trajected Light might be refracted either upwards or\r\nsideways, and thereby the round Image, which the Lens alone did cast\r\nupon the Paper might be drawn out into a long one with Parallel Sides,\r\nas in the third Experiment. This oblong Image I let fall upon another\r\nPaper at about the same distance from the Prism as before, moving the\r\nPaper either towards the Prism or from it, until I found the just\r\ndistance where the Rectilinear Sides of the Image became most distinct.\r\nFor in this Case, the Circular Images of the Hole, which compose that\r\nImage after the same manner that the Circles _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c. do\r\nthe Figure _pt_ [in _Fig._ 23.] were terminated most distinctly without\r\nany Penumbra, and therefore extended into one another the least that\r\nthey could, and by consequence the Mixture of the heterogeneous Rays was\r\nnow the least of all. By this means I used to form an oblong Image (such\r\nas is _pt_) [in _Fig._ 23, and 24.] of Circular Images of the Hole,\r\n(such as are _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c.) and by using a greater or less Hole\r\nin the Window-shut, I made the Circular Images _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c. of\r\nwhich it was formed, to become greater or less at pleasure, and thereby\r\nthe Mixture of the Rays in the Image _pt_ to be as much, or as little as\r\nI desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\n_Illustration._ In the twenty-fourth Figure, F represents the Circular\r\nHole in the Window-shut, MN the Lens, whereby the Image or Species of\r\nthat Hole is cast distinctly upon a Paper at J, ABC the Prism, whereby\r\nthe Rays are at their emerging out of the Lens refracted from J towards\r\nanother Paper at _pt_, and the round Image at J is turned into an oblong\r\nImage _pt_ falling on that other Paper. This Image _pt_ consists of\r\nCircles placed one after another in a Rectilinear Order, as was\r\nsufficiently explained in the fifth Experiment; and these Circles are\r\nequal to the Circle J, and consequently answer in magnitude to the Hole\r\nF; and therefore by diminishing that Hole they may be at pleasure\r\ndiminished, whilst their Centers remain in their Places. By this means I\r\nmade the Breadth of the Image _pt_ to be forty times, and sometimes\r\nsixty or seventy times less than its Length. As for instance, if the\r\nBreadth of the Hole F be one tenth of an Inch, and MF the distance of\r\nthe Lens from the Hole be 12 Feet; and if _p_B or _p_M the distance of\r\nthe Image _pt_ from the Prism or Lens be 10 Feet, and the refracting\r\nAngle of the Prism be 62 Degrees, the Breadth of the Image _pt_ will be\r\none twelfth of an Inch, and the Length about six Inches, and therefore\r\nthe Length to the Breadth as 72 to 1, and by consequence the Light of\r\nthis Image 71 times less compound than the Sun's direct Light. And Light\r\nthus far simple and homogeneal, is sufficient for trying all the\r\nExperiments in this Book about simple Light. For the Composition of\r\nheterogeneal Rays is in this Light so little, that it is scarce to be\r\ndiscovered and perceiv'd by Sense, except perhaps in the indigo and\r\nviolet. For these being dark Colours do easily suffer a sensible Allay\r\nby that little scattering Light which uses to be refracted irregularly\r\nby the Inequalities of the Prism.\r\n\r\nYet instead of the Circular Hole F, 'tis better to substitute an oblong\r\nHole shaped like a long Parallelogram with its Length parallel to the\r\nPrism ABC. For if this Hole be an Inch or two long, and but a tenth or\r\ntwentieth Part of an Inch broad, or narrower; the Light of the Image\r\n_pt_ will be as simple as before, or simpler, and the Image will become\r\nmuch broader, and therefore more fit to have Experiments try'd in its\r\nLight than before.\r\n\r\nInstead of this Parallelogram Hole may be substituted a triangular one\r\nof equal Sides, whose Base, for instance, is about the tenth Part of an\r\nInch, and its Height an Inch or more. For by this means, if the Axis of\r\nthe Prism be parallel to the Perpendicular of the Triangle, the Image\r\n_pt_ [in _Fig._ 25.] will now be form'd of equicrural Triangles _ag_,\r\n_bh_, _ci_, _dk_, _el_, _fm_, &c. and innumerable other intermediate\r\nones answering to the triangular Hole in Shape and Bigness, and lying\r\none after another in a continual Series between two Parallel Lines _af_\r\nand _gm_. These Triangles are a little intermingled at their Bases, but\r\nnot at their Vertices; and therefore the Light on the brighter Side _af_\r\nof the Image, where the Bases of the Triangles are, is a little\r\ncompounded, but on the darker Side _gm_ is altogether uncompounded, and\r\nin all Places between the Sides the Composition is proportional to the\r\ndistances of the Places from that obscurer Side _gm_. And having a\r\nSpectrum _pt_ of such a Composition, we may try Experiments either in\r\nits stronger and less simple Light near the Side _af_, or in its weaker\r\nand simpler Light near the other Side _gm_, as it shall seem most\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nBut in making Experiments of this kind, the Chamber ought to be made as\r\ndark as can be, lest any Foreign Light mingle it self with the Light of\r\nthe Spectrum _pt_, and render it compound; especially if we would try\r\nExperiments in the more simple Light next the Side _gm_ of the Spectrum;\r\nwhich being fainter, will have a less proportion to the Foreign Light;\r\nand so by the mixture of that Light be more troubled, and made more\r\ncompound. The Lens also ought to be good, such as may serve for optical\r\nUses, and the Prism ought to have a large Angle, suppose of 65 or 70\r\nDegrees, and to be well wrought, being made of Glass free from Bubbles\r\nand Veins, with its Sides not a little convex or concave, as usually\r\nhappens, but truly plane, and its Polish elaborate, as in working\r\nOptick-glasses, and not such as is usually wrought with Putty, whereby\r\nthe edges of the Sand-holes being worn away, there are left all over the\r\nGlass a numberless Company of very little convex polite Risings like\r\nWaves. The edges also of the Prism and Lens, so far as they may make any\r\nirregular Refraction, must be covered with a black Paper glewed on. And\r\nall the Light of the Sun's Beam let into the Chamber, which is useless\r\nand unprofitable to the Experiment, ought to be intercepted with black\r\nPaper, or other black Obstacles. For otherwise the useless Light being\r\nreflected every way in the Chamber, will mix with the oblong Spectrum,\r\nand help to disturb it. In trying these Things, so much diligence is not\r\naltogether necessary, but it will promote the Success of the\r\nExperiments, and by a very scrupulous Examiner of Things deserves to be\r\napply'd. It's difficult to get Glass Prisms fit for this Purpose, and\r\ntherefore I used sometimes prismatick Vessels made with pieces of broken\r\nLooking-glasses, and filled with Rain Water. And to increase the\r\nRefraction, I sometimes impregnated the Water strongly with _Saccharum\r\nSaturni_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ V. THEOR. IV.\r\n\r\n_Homogeneal Light is refracted regularly without any Dilatation\r\nsplitting or shattering of the Rays, and the confused Vision of Objects\r\nseen through refracting Bodies by heterogeneal Light arises from the\r\ndifferent Refrangibility of several sorts of Rays._\r\n\r\nThe first Part of this Proposition has been already sufficiently proved\r\nin the fifth Experiment, and will farther appear by the Experiments\r\nwhich follow.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 12. In the middle of a black Paper I made a round Hole about a\r\nfifth or sixth Part of an Inch in diameter. Upon this Paper I caused the\r\nSpectrum of homogeneal Light described in the former Proposition, so to\r\nfall, that some part of the Light might pass through the Hole of the\r\nPaper. This transmitted part of the Light I refracted with a Prism\r\nplaced behind the Paper, and letting this refracted Light fall\r\nperpendicularly upon a white Paper two or three Feet distant from the\r\nPrism, I found that the Spectrum formed on the Paper by this Light was\r\nnot oblong, as when 'tis made (in the third Experiment) by refracting\r\nthe Sun's compound Light, but was (so far as I could judge by my Eye)\r\nperfectly circular, the Length being no greater than the Breadth. Which\r\nshews, that this Light is refracted regularly without any Dilatation of\r\nthe Rays.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 13. In the homogeneal Light I placed a Paper Circle of a\r\nquarter of an Inch in diameter, and in the Sun's unrefracted\r\nheterogeneal white Light I placed another Paper Circle of the same\r\nBigness. And going from the Papers to the distance of some Feet, I\r\nviewed both Circles through a Prism. The Circle illuminated by the Sun's\r\nheterogeneal Light appeared very oblong, as in the fourth Experiment,\r\nthe Length being many times greater than the Breadth; but the other\r\nCircle, illuminated with homogeneal Light, appeared circular and\r\ndistinctly defined, as when 'tis view'd with the naked Eye. Which proves\r\nthe whole Proposition.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 14. In the homogeneal Light I placed Flies, and such-like\r\nminute Objects, and viewing them through a Prism, I saw their Parts as\r\ndistinctly defined, as if I had viewed them with the naked Eye. The same\r\nObjects placed in the Sun's unrefracted heterogeneal Light, which was\r\nwhite, I viewed also through a Prism, and saw them most confusedly\r\ndefined, so that I could not distinguish their smaller Parts from one\r\nanother. I placed also the Letters of a small print, one while in the\r\nhomogeneal Light, and then in the heterogeneal, and viewing them through\r\na Prism, they appeared in the latter Case so confused and indistinct,\r\nthat I could not read them; but in the former they appeared so distinct,\r\nthat I could read readily, and thought I saw them as distinct, as when I\r\nview'd them with my naked Eye. In both Cases I view'd the same Objects,\r\nthrough the same Prism at the same distance from me, and in the same\r\nSituation. There was no difference, but in the Light by which the\r\nObjects were illuminated, and which in one Case was simple, and in the\r\nother compound; and therefore, the distinct Vision in the former Case,\r\nand confused in the latter, could arise from nothing else than from that\r\ndifference of the Lights. Which proves the whole Proposition.\r\n\r\nAnd in these three Experiments it is farther very remarkable, that the\r\nColour of homogeneal Light was never changed by the Refraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ VI. THEOR. V.\r\n\r\n_The Sine of Incidence of every Ray considered apart, is to its Sine of\r\nRefraction in a given Ratio._\r\n\r\nThat every Ray consider'd apart, is constant to it self in some degree\r\nof Refrangibility, is sufficiently manifest out of what has been said.\r\nThose Rays, which in the first Refraction, are at equal Incidences most\r\nrefracted, are also in the following Refractions at equal Incidences\r\nmost refracted; and so of the least refrangible, and the rest which have\r\nany mean Degree of Refrangibility, as is manifest by the fifth, sixth,\r\nseventh, eighth, and ninth Experiments. And those which the first Time\r\nat like Incidences are equally refracted, are again at like Incidences\r\nequally and uniformly refracted, and that whether they be refracted\r\nbefore they be separated from one another, as in the fifth Experiment,\r\nor whether they be refracted apart, as in the twelfth, thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth Experiments. The Refraction therefore of every Ray apart is\r\nregular, and what Rule that Refraction observes we are now to shew.[E]\r\n\r\nThe late Writers in Opticks teach, that the Sines of Incidence are in a\r\ngiven Proportion to the Sines of Refraction, as was explained in the\r\nfifth Axiom, and some by Instruments fitted for measuring of\r\nRefractions, or otherwise experimentally examining this Proportion, do\r\nacquaint us that they have found it accurate. But whilst they, not\r\nunderstanding the different Refrangibility of several Rays, conceived\r\nthem all to be refracted according to one and the same Proportion, 'tis\r\nto be presumed that they adapted their Measures only to the middle of\r\nthe refracted Light; so that from their Measures we may conclude only\r\nthat the Rays which have a mean Degree of Refrangibility, that is, those\r\nwhich when separated from the rest appear green, are refracted according\r\nto a given Proportion of their Sines. And therefore we are now to shew,\r\nthat the like given Proportions obtain in all the rest. That it should\r\nbe so is very reasonable, Nature being ever conformable to her self; but\r\nan experimental Proof is desired. And such a Proof will be had, if we\r\ncan shew that the Sines of Refraction of Rays differently refrangible\r\nare one to another in a given Proportion when their Sines of Incidence\r\nare equal. For, if the Sines of Refraction of all the Rays are in given\r\nProportions to the Sine of Refractions of a Ray which has a mean Degree\r\nof Refrangibility, and this Sine is in a given Proportion to the equal\r\nSines of Incidence, those other Sines of Refraction will also be in\r\ngiven Proportions to the equal Sines of Incidence. Now, when the Sines\r\nof Incidence are equal, it will appear by the following Experiment, that\r\nthe Sines of Refraction are in a given Proportion to one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 15. The Sun shining into a dark Chamber through a little round\r\nHole in the Window-shut, let S [in _Fig._ 26.] represent his round white\r\nImage painted on the opposite Wall by his direct Light, PT his oblong\r\ncoloured Image made by refracting that Light with a Prism placed at the\r\nWindow; and _pt_, or _2p 2t_, _3p 3t_, his oblong colour'd Image made by\r\nrefracting again the same Light sideways with a second Prism placed\r\nimmediately after the first in a cross Position to it, as was explained\r\nin the fifth Experiment; that is to say, _pt_ when the Refraction of the\r\nsecond Prism is small, _2p 2t_ when its Refraction is greater, and _3p\r\n3t_ when it is greatest. For such will be the diversity of the\r\nRefractions, if the refracting Angle of the second Prism be of various\r\nMagnitudes; suppose of fifteen or twenty Degrees to make the Image _pt_,\r\nof thirty or forty to make the Image _2p 2t_, and of sixty to make the\r\nImage _3p 3t_. But for want of solid Glass Prisms with Angles of\r\nconvenient Bignesses, there may be Vessels made of polished Plates of\r\nGlass cemented together in the form of Prisms and filled with Water.\r\nThese things being thus ordered, I observed that all the solar Images or\r\ncoloured Spectrums PT, _pt_, _2p 2t_, _3p 3t_ did very nearly converge\r\nto the place S on which the direct Light of the Sun fell and painted his\r\nwhite round Image when the Prisms were taken away. The Axis of the\r\nSpectrum PT, that is the Line drawn through the middle of it parallel to\r\nits rectilinear Sides, did when produced pass exactly through the middle\r\nof that white round Image S. And when the Refraction of the second Prism\r\nwas equal to the Refraction of the first, the refracting Angles of them\r\nboth being about 60 Degrees, the Axis of the Spectrum _3p 3t_ made by\r\nthat Refraction, did when produced pass also through the middle of the\r\nsame white round Image S. But when the Refraction of the second Prism\r\nwas less than that of the first, the produced Axes of the Spectrums _tp_\r\nor _2t 2p_ made by that Refraction did cut the produced Axis of the\r\nSpectrum TP in the points _m_ and _n_, a little beyond the Center of\r\nthat white round Image S. Whence the proportion of the Line 3_t_T to the\r\nLine 3_p_P was a little greater than the Proportion of 2_t_T or 2_p_P,\r\nand this Proportion a little greater than that of _t_T to _p_P. Now when\r\nthe Light of the Spectrum PT falls perpendicularly upon the Wall, those\r\nLines 3_t_T, 3_p_P, and 2_t_T, and 2_p_P, and _t_T, _p_P, are the\r\nTangents of the Refractions, and therefore by this Experiment the\r\nProportions of the Tangents of the Refractions are obtained, from whence\r\nthe Proportions of the Sines being derived, they come out equal, so far\r\nas by viewing the Spectrums, and using some mathematical Reasoning I\r\ncould estimate. For I did not make an accurate Computation. So then the\r\nProposition holds true in every Ray apart, so far as appears by\r\nExperiment. And that it is accurately true, may be demonstrated upon\r\nthis Supposition. _That Bodies refract Light by acting upon its Rays in\r\nLines perpendicular to their Surfaces._ But in order to this\r\nDemonstration, I must distinguish the Motion of every Ray into two\r\nMotions, the one perpendicular to the refracting Surface, the other\r\nparallel to it, and concerning the perpendicular Motion lay down the\r\nfollowing Proposition.\r\n\r\nIf any Motion or moving thing whatsoever be incident with any Velocity\r\non any broad and thin space terminated on both sides by two parallel\r\nPlanes, and in its Passage through that space be urged perpendicularly\r\ntowards the farther Plane by any force which at given distances from the\r\nPlane is of given Quantities; the perpendicular velocity of that Motion\r\nor Thing, at its emerging out of that space, shall be always equal to\r\nthe square Root of the sum of the square of the perpendicular velocity\r\nof that Motion or Thing at its Incidence on that space; and of the\r\nsquare of the perpendicular velocity which that Motion or Thing would\r\nhave at its Emergence, if at its Incidence its perpendicular velocity\r\nwas infinitely little.\r\n\r\nAnd the same Proposition holds true of any Motion or Thing\r\nperpendicularly retarded in its passage through that space, if instead\r\nof the sum of the two Squares you take their difference. The\r\nDemonstration Mathematicians will easily find out, and therefore I shall\r\nnot trouble the Reader with it.\r\n\r\nSuppose now that a Ray coming most obliquely in the Line MC [in _Fig._\r\n1.] be refracted at C by the Plane RS into the Line CN, and if it be\r\nrequired to find the Line CE, into which any other Ray AC shall be\r\nrefracted; let MC, AD, be the Sines of Incidence of the two Rays, and\r\nNG, EF, their Sines of Refraction, and let the equal Motions of the\r\nincident Rays be represented by the equal Lines MC and AC, and the\r\nMotion MC being considered as parallel to the refracting Plane, let the\r\nother Motion AC be distinguished into two Motions AD and DC, one of\r\nwhich AD is parallel, and the other DC perpendicular to the refracting\r\nSurface. In like manner, let the Motions of the emerging Rays be\r\ndistinguish'd into two, whereof the perpendicular ones are MC/NG x CG\r\nand AD/EF x CF. And if the force of the refracting Plane begins to act\r\nupon the Rays either in that Plane or at a certain distance from it on\r\nthe one side, and ends at a certain distance from it on the other side,\r\nand in all places between those two limits acts upon the Rays in Lines\r\nperpendicular to that refracting Plane, and the Actions upon the Rays at\r\nequal distances from the refracting Plane be equal, and at unequal ones\r\neither equal or unequal according to any rate whatever; that Motion of\r\nthe Ray which is parallel to the refracting Plane, will suffer no\r\nAlteration by that Force; and that Motion which is perpendicular to it\r\nwill be altered according to the rule of the foregoing Proposition. If\r\ntherefore for the perpendicular velocity of the emerging Ray CN you\r\nwrite MC/NG x CG as above, then the perpendicular velocity of any other\r\nemerging Ray CE which was AD/EF x CF, will be equal to the square Root\r\nof CD_q_ + (_MCq/NGq_ x CG_q_). And by squaring these Equals, and adding\r\nto them the Equals AD_q_ and MC_q_ - CD_q_, and dividing the Sums by the\r\nEquals CF_q_ + EF_q_ and CG_q_ + NG_q_, you will have _MCq/NGq_ equal to\r\n_ADq/EFq_. Whence AD, the Sine of Incidence, is to EF the Sine of\r\nRefraction, as MC to NG, that is, in a given _ratio_. And this\r\nDemonstration being general, without determining what Light is, or by\r\nwhat kind of Force it is refracted, or assuming any thing farther than\r\nthat the refracting Body acts upon the Rays in Lines perpendicular to\r\nits Surface; I take it to be a very convincing Argument of the full\r\ntruth of this Proposition.\r\n\r\nSo then, if the _ratio_ of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of any\r\nsort of Rays be found in any one case, 'tis given in all cases; and this\r\nmay be readily found by the Method in the following Proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ VII. THEOR. VI.\r\n\r\n_The Perfection of Telescopes is impeded by the different Refrangibility\r\nof the Rays of Light._\r\n\r\nThe Imperfection of Telescopes is vulgarly attributed to the spherical\r\nFigures of the Glasses, and therefore Mathematicians have propounded to\r\nfigure them by the conical Sections. To shew that they are mistaken, I\r\nhave inserted this Proposition; the truth of which will appear by the\r\nmeasure of the Refractions of the several sorts of Rays; and these\r\nmeasures I thus determine.\r\n\r\nIn the third Experiment of this first Part, where the refracting Angle\r\nof the Prism was 62-1/2 Degrees, the half of that Angle 31 deg. 15 min.\r\nis the Angle of Incidence of the Rays at their going out of the Glass\r\ninto the Air[F]; and the Sine of this Angle is 5188, the Radius being\r\n10000. When the Axis of this Prism was parallel to the Horizon, and the\r\nRefraction of the Rays at their Incidence on this Prism equal to that at\r\ntheir Emergence out of it, I observed with a Quadrant the Angle which\r\nthe mean refrangible Rays, (that is those which went to the middle of\r\nthe Sun's coloured Image) made with the Horizon, and by this Angle and\r\nthe Sun's altitude observed at the same time, I found the Angle which\r\nthe emergent Rays contained with the incident to be 44 deg. and 40 min.\r\nand the half of this Angle added to the Angle of Incidence 31 deg. 15\r\nmin. makes the Angle of Refraction, which is therefore 53 deg. 35 min.\r\nand its Sine 8047. These are the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of\r\nthe mean refrangible Rays, and their Proportion in round Numbers is 20\r\nto 31. This Glass was of a Colour inclining to green. The last of the\r\nPrisms mentioned in the third Experiment was of clear white Glass. Its\r\nrefracting Angle 63-1/2 Degrees. The Angle which the emergent Rays\r\ncontained, with the incident 45 deg. 50 min. The Sine of half the first\r\nAngle 5262. The Sine of half the Sum of the Angles 8157. And their\r\nProportion in round Numbers 20 to 31, as before.\r\n\r\nFrom the Length of the Image, which was about 9-3/4 or 10 Inches,\r\nsubduct its Breadth, which was 2-1/8 Inches, and the Remainder 7-3/4\r\nInches would be the Length of the Image were the Sun but a Point, and\r\ntherefore subtends the Angle which the most and least refrangible Rays,\r\nwhen incident on the Prism in the same Lines, do contain with one\r\nanother after their Emergence. Whence this Angle is 2 deg. 0'. 7''. For\r\nthe distance between the Image and the Prism where this Angle is made,\r\nwas 18-1/2 Feet, and at that distance the Chord 7-3/4 Inches subtends an\r\nAngle of 2 deg. 0'. 7''. Now half this Angle is the Angle which these\r\nemergent Rays contain with the emergent mean refrangible Rays, and a\r\nquarter thereof, that is 30'. 2''. may be accounted the Angle which they\r\nwould contain with the same emergent mean refrangible Rays, were they\r\nco-incident to them within the Glass, and suffered no other Refraction\r\nthan that at their Emergence. For, if two equal Refractions, the one at\r\nthe Incidence of the Rays on the Prism, the other at their Emergence,\r\nmake half the Angle 2 deg. 0'. 7''. then one of those Refractions will\r\nmake about a quarter of that Angle, and this quarter added to, and\r\nsubducted from the Angle of Refraction of the mean refrangible Rays,\r\nwhich was 53 deg. 35', gives the Angles of Refraction of the most and\r\nleast refrangible Rays 54 deg. 5' 2'', and 53 deg. 4' 58'', whose Sines\r\nare 8099 and 7995, the common Angle of Incidence being 31 deg. 15', and\r\nits Sine 5188; and these Sines in the least round Numbers are in\r\nproportion to one another, as 78 and 77 to 50.\r\n\r\nNow, if you subduct the common Sine of Incidence 50 from the Sines of\r\nRefraction 77 and 78, the Remainders 27 and 28 shew, that in small\r\nRefractions the Refraction of the least refrangible Rays is to the\r\nRefraction of the most refrangible ones, as 27 to 28 very nearly, and\r\nthat the difference of the Refractions of the least refrangible and most\r\nrefrangible Rays is about the 27-1/2th Part of the whole Refraction of\r\nthe mean refrangible Rays.\r\n\r\nWhence they that are skilled in Opticks will easily understand,[G] that\r\nthe Breadth of the least circular Space, into which Object-glasses of\r\nTelescopes can collect all sorts of Parallel Rays, is about the 27-1/2th\r\nPart of half the Aperture of the Glass, or 55th Part of the whole\r\nAperture; and that the Focus of the most refrangible Rays is nearer to\r\nthe Object-glass than the Focus of the least refrangible ones, by about\r\nthe 27-1/2th Part of the distance between the Object-glass and the Focus\r\nof the mean refrangible ones.\r\n\r\nAnd if Rays of all sorts, flowing from any one lucid Point in the Axis\r\nof any convex Lens, be made by the Refraction of the Lens to converge to\r\nPoints not too remote from the Lens, the Focus of the most refrangible\r\nRays shall be nearer to the Lens than the Focus of the least refrangible\r\nones, by a distance which is to the 27-1/2th Part of the distance of the\r\nFocus of the mean refrangible Rays from the Lens, as the distance\r\nbetween that Focus and the lucid Point, from whence the Rays flow, is to\r\nthe distance between that lucid Point and the Lens very nearly.\r\n\r\nNow to examine whether the Difference between the Refractions, which the\r\nmost refrangible and the least refrangible Rays flowing from the same\r\nPoint suffer in the Object-glasses of Telescopes and such-like Glasses,\r\nbe so great as is here described, I contrived the following Experiment.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 16. The Lens which I used in the second and eighth Experiments,\r\nbeing placed six Feet and an Inch distant from any Object, collected the\r\nSpecies of that Object by the mean refrangible Rays at the distance of\r\nsix Feet and an Inch from the Lens on the other side. And therefore by\r\nthe foregoing Rule, it ought to collect the Species of that Object by\r\nthe least refrangible Rays at the distance of six Feet and 3-2/3 Inches\r\nfrom the Lens, and by the most refrangible ones at the distance of five\r\nFeet and 10-1/3 Inches from it: So that between the two Places, where\r\nthese least and most refrangible Rays collect the Species, there may be\r\nthe distance of about 5-1/3 Inches. For by that Rule, as six Feet and an\r\nInch (the distance of the Lens from the lucid Object) is to twelve Feet\r\nand two Inches (the distance of the lucid Object from the Focus of the\r\nmean refrangible Rays) that is, as One is to Two; so is the 27-1/2th\r\nPart of six Feet and an Inch (the distance between the Lens and the same\r\nFocus) to the distance between the Focus of the most refrangible Rays\r\nand the Focus of the least refrangible ones, which is therefore 5-17/55\r\nInches, that is very nearly 5-1/3 Inches. Now to know whether this\r\nMeasure was true, I repeated the second and eighth Experiment with\r\ncoloured Light, which was less compounded than that I there made use of:\r\nFor I now separated the heterogeneous Rays from one another by the\r\nMethod I described in the eleventh Experiment, so as to make a coloured\r\nSpectrum about twelve or fifteen Times longer than broad. This Spectrum\r\nI cast on a printed Book, and placing the above-mentioned Lens at the\r\ndistance of six Feet and an Inch from this Spectrum to collect the\r\nSpecies of the illuminated Letters at the same distance on the other\r\nside, I found that the Species of the Letters illuminated with blue were\r\nnearer to the Lens than those illuminated with deep red by about three\r\nInches, or three and a quarter; but the Species of the Letters\r\nilluminated with indigo and violet appeared so confused and indistinct,\r\nthat I could not read them: Whereupon viewing the Prism, I found it was\r\nfull of Veins running from one end of the Glass to the other; so that\r\nthe Refraction could not be regular. I took another Prism therefore\r\nwhich was free from Veins, and instead of the Letters I used two or\r\nthree Parallel black Lines a little broader than the Strokes of the\r\nLetters, and casting the Colours upon these Lines in such manner, that\r\nthe Lines ran along the Colours from one end of the Spectrum to the\r\nother, I found that the Focus where the indigo, or confine of this\r\nColour and violet cast the Species of the black Lines most distinctly,\r\nto be about four Inches, or 4-1/4 nearer to the Lens than the Focus,\r\nwhere the deepest red cast the Species of the same black Lines most\r\ndistinctly. The violet was so faint and dark, that I could not discern\r\nthe Species of the Lines distinctly by that Colour; and therefore\r\nconsidering that the Prism was made of a dark coloured Glass inclining\r\nto green, I took another Prism of clear white Glass; but the Spectrum of\r\nColours which this Prism made had long white Streams of faint Light\r\nshooting out from both ends of the Colours, which made me conclude that\r\nsomething was amiss; and viewing the Prism, I found two or three little\r\nBubbles in the Glass, which refracted the Light irregularly. Wherefore I\r\ncovered that Part of the Glass with black Paper, and letting the Light\r\npass through another Part of it which was free from such Bubbles, the\r\nSpectrum of Colours became free from those irregular Streams of Light,\r\nand was now such as I desired. But still I found the violet so dark and\r\nfaint, that I could scarce see the Species of the Lines by the violet,\r\nand not at all by the deepest Part of it, which was next the end of the\r\nSpectrum. I suspected therefore, that this faint and dark Colour might\r\nbe allayed by that scattering Light which was refracted, and reflected\r\nirregularly, partly by some very small Bubbles in the Glasses, and\r\npartly by the Inequalities of their Polish; which Light, tho' it was but\r\nlittle, yet it being of a white Colour, might suffice to affect the\r\nSense so strongly as to disturb the Phaenomena of that weak and dark\r\nColour the violet, and therefore I tried, as in the 12th, 13th, and 14th\r\nExperiments, whether the Light of this Colour did not consist of a\r\nsensible Mixture of heterogeneous Rays, but found it did not. Nor did\r\nthe Refractions cause any other sensible Colour than violet to emerge\r\nout of this Light, as they would have done out of white Light, and by\r\nconsequence out of this violet Light had it been sensibly compounded\r\nwith white Light. And therefore I concluded, that the reason why I could\r\nnot see the Species of the Lines distinctly by this Colour, was only\r\nthe Darkness of this Colour, and Thinness of its Light, and its distance\r\nfrom the Axis of the Lens; I divided therefore those Parallel black\r\nLines into equal Parts, by which I might readily know the distances of\r\nthe Colours in the Spectrum from one another, and noted the distances of\r\nthe Lens from the Foci of such Colours, as cast the Species of the Lines\r\ndistinctly, and then considered whether the difference of those\r\ndistances bear such proportion to 5-1/3 Inches, the greatest Difference\r\nof the distances, which the Foci of the deepest red and violet ought to\r\nhave from the Lens, as the distance of the observed Colours from one\r\nanother in the Spectrum bear to the greatest distance of the deepest red\r\nand violet measured in the Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum, that is,\r\nto the Length of those Sides, or Excess of the Length of the Spectrum\r\nabove its Breadth. And my Observations were as follows.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed and compared the deepest sensible red, and the Colour in\r\nthe Confine of green and blue, which at the Rectilinear Sides of the\r\nSpectrum was distant from it half the Length of those Sides, the Focus\r\nwhere the Confine of green and blue cast the Species of the Lines\r\ndistinctly on the Paper, was nearer to the Lens than the Focus, where\r\nthe red cast those Lines distinctly on it by about 2-1/2 or 2-3/4\r\nInches. For sometimes the Measures were a little greater, sometimes a\r\nlittle less, but seldom varied from one another above 1/3 of an Inch.\r\nFor it was very difficult to define the Places of the Foci, without some\r\nlittle Errors. Now, if the Colours distant half the Length of the\r\nImage, (measured at its Rectilinear Sides) give 2-1/2 or 2-3/4\r\nDifference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens, then the\r\nColours distant the whole Length ought to give 5 or 5-1/2 Inches\r\ndifference of those distances.\r\n\r\nBut here it's to be noted, that I could not see the red to the full end\r\nof the Spectrum, but only to the Center of the Semicircle which bounded\r\nthat end, or a little farther; and therefore I compared this red not\r\nwith that Colour which was exactly in the middle of the Spectrum, or\r\nConfine of green and blue, but with that which verged a little more to\r\nthe blue than to the green: And as I reckoned the whole Length of the\r\nColours not to be the whole Length of the Spectrum, but the Length of\r\nits Rectilinear Sides, so compleating the semicircular Ends into\r\nCircles, when either of the observed Colours fell within those Circles,\r\nI measured the distance of that Colour from the semicircular End of the\r\nSpectrum, and subducting half this distance from the measured distance\r\nof the two Colours, I took the Remainder for their corrected distance;\r\nand in these Observations set down this corrected distance for the\r\ndifference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens. For, as the\r\nLength of the Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum would be the whole\r\nLength of all the Colours, were the Circles of which (as we shewed) that\r\nSpectrum consists contracted and reduced to Physical Points, so in that\r\nCase this corrected distance would be the real distance of the two\r\nobserved Colours.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore I farther observed the deepest sensible red, and that\r\nblue whose corrected distance from it was 7/12 Parts of the Length of\r\nthe Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances\r\nof their Foci from the Lens was about 3-1/4 Inches, and as 7 to 12, so\r\nis 3-1/4 to 5-4/7.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed the deepest sensible red, and that indigo whose\r\ncorrected distance was 8/12 or 2/3 of the Length of the Rectilinear\r\nSides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances of their Foci\r\nfrom the Lens, was about 3-2/3 Inches, and as 2 to 3, so is 3-2/3 to\r\n5-1/2.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed the deepest sensible red, and that deep indigo whose\r\ncorrected distance from one another was 9/12 or 3/4 of the Length of the\r\nRectilinear Sides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances of\r\ntheir Foci from the Lens was about 4 Inches; and as 3 to 4, so is 4 to\r\n5-1/3.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed the deepest sensible red, and that Part of the violet\r\nnext the indigo, whose corrected distance from the red was 10/12 or 5/6\r\nof the Length of the Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum, the difference\r\nof the distances of their Foci from the Lens was about 4-1/2 Inches, and\r\nas 5 to 6, so is 4-1/2 to 5-2/5. For sometimes, when the Lens was\r\nadvantageously placed, so that its Axis respected the blue, and all\r\nThings else were well ordered, and the Sun shone clear, and I held my\r\nEye very near to the Paper on which the Lens cast the Species of the\r\nLines, I could see pretty distinctly the Species of those Lines by that\r\nPart of the violet which was next the indigo; and sometimes I could see\r\nthem by above half the violet, For in making these Experiments I had\r\nobserved, that the Species of those Colours only appear distinct, which\r\nwere in or near the Axis of the Lens: So that if the blue or indigo were\r\nin the Axis, I could see their Species distinctly; and then the red\r\nappeared much less distinct than before. Wherefore I contrived to make\r\nthe Spectrum of Colours shorter than before, so that both its Ends might\r\nbe nearer to the Axis of the Lens. And now its Length was about 2-1/2\r\nInches, and Breadth about 1/5 or 1/6 of an Inch. Also instead of the\r\nblack Lines on which the Spectrum was cast, I made one black Line\r\nbroader than those, that I might see its Species more easily; and this\r\nLine I divided by short cross Lines into equal Parts, for measuring the\r\ndistances of the observed Colours. And now I could sometimes see the\r\nSpecies of this Line with its Divisions almost as far as the Center of\r\nthe semicircular violet End of the Spectrum, and made these farther\r\nObservations.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed the deepest sensible red, and that Part of the violet,\r\nwhose corrected distance from it was about 8/9 Parts of the Rectilinear\r\nSides of the Spectrum, the Difference of the distances of the Foci of\r\nthose Colours from the Lens, was one time 4-2/3, another time 4-3/4,\r\nanother time 4-7/8 Inches; and as 8 to 9, so are 4-2/3, 4-3/4, 4-7/8, to\r\n5-1/4, 5-11/32, 5-31/64 respectively.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed the deepest sensible red, and deepest sensible violet,\r\n(the corrected distance of which Colours, when all Things were ordered\r\nto the best Advantage, and the Sun shone very clear, was about 11/12 or\r\n15/16 Parts of the Length of the Rectilinear Sides of the coloured\r\nSpectrum) I found the Difference of the distances of their Foci from the\r\nLens sometimes 4-3/4 sometimes 5-1/4, and for the most part 5 Inches or\r\nthereabouts; and as 11 to 12, or 15 to 16, so is five Inches to 5-2/2 or\r\n5-1/3 Inches.\r\n\r\nAnd by this Progression of Experiments I satisfied my self, that had the\r\nLight at the very Ends of the Spectrum been strong enough to make the\r\nSpecies of the black Lines appear plainly on the Paper, the Focus of the\r\ndeepest violet would have been found nearer to the Lens, than the Focus\r\nof the deepest red, by about 5-1/3 Inches at least. And this is a\r\nfarther Evidence, that the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of the\r\nseveral sorts of Rays, hold the same Proportion to one another in the\r\nsmallest Refractions which they do in the greatest.\r\n\r\nMy Progress in making this nice and troublesome Experiment I have set\r\ndown more at large, that they that shall try it after me may be aware of\r\nthe Circumspection requisite to make it succeed well. And if they cannot\r\nmake it succeed so well as I did, they may notwithstanding collect by\r\nthe Proportion of the distance of the Colours of the Spectrum, to the\r\nDifference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens, what would be\r\nthe Success in the more distant Colours by a better trial. And yet, if\r\nthey use a broader Lens than I did, and fix it to a long strait Staff,\r\nby means of which it may be readily and truly directed to the Colour\r\nwhose Focus is desired, I question not but the Experiment will succeed\r\nbetter with them than it did with me. For I directed the Axis as nearly\r\nas I could to the middle of the Colours, and then the faint Ends of the\r\nSpectrum being remote from the Axis, cast their Species less distinctly\r\non the Paper than they would have done, had the Axis been successively\r\ndirected to them.\r\n\r\nNow by what has been said, it's certain that the Rays which differ in\r\nRefrangibility do not converge to the same Focus; but if they flow from\r\na lucid Point, as far from the Lens on one side as their Foci are on the\r\nother, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the\r\nLens than that of the least refrangible, by above the fourteenth Part of\r\nthe whole distance; and if they flow from a lucid Point, so very remote\r\nfrom the Lens, that before their Incidence they may be accounted\r\nparallel, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the\r\nLens than the Focus of the least refrangible, by about the 27th or 28th\r\nPart of their whole distance from it. And the Diameter of the Circle in\r\nthe middle Space between those two Foci which they illuminate, when they\r\nfall there on any Plane, perpendicular to the Axis (which Circle is the\r\nleast into which they can all be gathered) is about the 55th Part of the\r\nDiameter of the Aperture of the Glass. So that 'tis a wonder, that\r\nTelescopes represent Objects so distinct as they do. But were all the\r\nRays of Light equally refrangible, the Error arising only from the\r\nSphericalness of the Figures of Glasses would be many hundred times\r\nless. For, if the Object-glass of a Telescope be Plano-convex, and the\r\nPlane side be turned towards the Object, and the Diameter of the\r\nSphere, whereof this Glass is a Segment, be called D, and the\r\nSemi-diameter of the Aperture of the Glass be called S, and the Sine of\r\nIncidence out of Glass into Air, be to the Sine of Refraction as I to R;\r\nthe Rays which come parallel to the Axis of the Glass, shall in the\r\nPlace where the Image of the Object is most distinctly made, be\r\nscattered all over a little Circle, whose Diameter is _(Rq/Iq) x (S\r\ncub./D quad.)_ very nearly,[H] as I gather by computing the Errors of\r\nthe Rays by the Method of infinite Series, and rejecting the Terms,\r\nwhose Quantities are inconsiderable. As for instance, if the Sine of\r\nIncidence I, be to the Sine of Refraction R, as 20 to 31, and if D the\r\nDiameter of the Sphere, to which the Convex-side of the Glass is ground,\r\nbe 100 Feet or 1200 Inches, and S the Semi-diameter of the Aperture be\r\ntwo Inches, the Diameter of the little Circle, (that is (_Rq x S\r\ncub.)/(Iq x D quad._)) will be (31 x 31 x 8)/(20 x 20 x 1200 x 1200) (or\r\n961/72000000) Parts of an Inch. But the Diameter of the little Circle,\r\nthrough which these Rays are scattered by unequal Refrangibility, will\r\nbe about the 55th Part of the Aperture of the Object-glass, which here\r\nis four Inches. And therefore, the Error arising from the Spherical\r\nFigure of the Glass, is to the Error arising from the different\r\nRefrangibility of the Rays, as 961/72000000 to 4/55, that is as 1 to\r\n5449; and therefore being in comparison so very little, deserves not to\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nBut you will say, if the Errors caused by the different Refrangibility\r\nbe so very great, how comes it to pass, that Objects appear through\r\nTelescopes so distinct as they do? I answer, 'tis because the erring\r\nRays are not scattered uniformly over all that Circular Space, but\r\ncollected infinitely more densely in the Center than in any other Part\r\nof the Circle, and in the Way from the Center to the Circumference, grow\r\ncontinually rarer and rarer, so as at the Circumference to become\r\ninfinitely rare; and by reason of their Rarity are not strong enough to\r\nbe visible, unless in the Center and very near it. Let ADE [in _Fig._\r\n27.] represent one of those Circles described with the Center C, and\r\nSemi-diameter AC, and let BFG be a smaller Circle concentrick to the\r\nformer, cutting with its Circumference the Diameter AC in B, and bisect\r\nAC in N; and by my reckoning, the Density of the Light in any Place B,\r\nwill be to its Density in N, as AB to BC; and the whole Light within the\r\nlesser Circle BFG, will be to the whole Light within the greater AED, as\r\nthe Excess of the Square of AC above the Square of AB, is to the Square\r\nof AC. As if BC be the fifth Part of AC, the Light will be four times\r\ndenser in B than in N, and the whole Light within the less Circle, will\r\nbe to the whole Light within the greater, as nine to twenty-five. Whence\r\nit's evident, that the Light within the less Circle, must strike the\r\nSense much more strongly, than that faint and dilated Light round about\r\nbetween it and the Circumference of the greater.\r\n\r\nBut it's farther to be noted, that the most luminous of the Prismatick\r\nColours are the yellow and orange. These affect the Senses more strongly\r\nthan all the rest together, and next to these in strength are the red\r\nand green. The blue compared with these is a faint and dark Colour, and\r\nthe indigo and violet are much darker and fainter, so that these\r\ncompared with the stronger Colours are little to be regarded. The Images\r\nof Objects are therefore to be placed, not in the Focus of the mean\r\nrefrangible Rays, which are in the Confine of green and blue, but in the\r\nFocus of those Rays which are in the middle of the orange and yellow;\r\nthere where the Colour is most luminous and fulgent, that is in the\r\nbrightest yellow, that yellow which inclines more to orange than to\r\ngreen. And by the Refraction of these Rays (whose Sines of Incidence and\r\nRefraction in Glass are as 17 and 11) the Refraction of Glass and\r\nCrystal for Optical Uses is to be measured. Let us therefore place the\r\nImage of the Object in the Focus of these Rays, and all the yellow and\r\norange will fall within a Circle, whose Diameter is about the 250th\r\nPart of the Diameter of the Aperture of the Glass. And if you add the\r\nbrighter half of the red, (that half which is next the orange) and the\r\nbrighter half of the green, (that half which is next the yellow) about\r\nthree fifth Parts of the Light of these two Colours will fall within the\r\nsame Circle, and two fifth Parts will fall without it round about; and\r\nthat which falls without will be spread through almost as much more\r\nspace as that which falls within, and so in the gross be almost three\r\ntimes rarer. Of the other half of the red and green, (that is of the\r\ndeep dark red and willow green) about one quarter will fall within this\r\nCircle, and three quarters without, and that which falls without will be\r\nspread through about four or five times more space than that which falls\r\nwithin; and so in the gross be rarer, and if compared with the whole\r\nLight within it, will be about 25 times rarer than all that taken in the\r\ngross; or rather more than 30 or 40 times rarer, because the deep red in\r\nthe end of the Spectrum of Colours made by a Prism is very thin and\r\nrare, and the willow green is something rarer than the orange and\r\nyellow. The Light of these Colours therefore being so very much rarer\r\nthan that within the Circle, will scarce affect the Sense, especially\r\nsince the deep red and willow green of this Light, are much darker\r\nColours than the rest. And for the same reason the blue and violet being\r\nmuch darker Colours than these, and much more rarified, may be\r\nneglected. For the dense and bright Light of the Circle, will obscure\r\nthe rare and weak Light of these dark Colours round about it, and\r\nrender them almost insensible. The sensible Image of a lucid Point is\r\ntherefore scarce broader than a Circle, whose Diameter is the 250th Part\r\nof the Diameter of the Aperture of the Object-glass of a good Telescope,\r\nor not much broader, if you except a faint and dark misty Light round\r\nabout it, which a Spectator will scarce regard. And therefore in a\r\nTelescope, whose Aperture is four Inches, and Length an hundred Feet, it\r\nexceeds not 2'' 45''', or 3''. And in a Telescope whose Aperture is two\r\nInches, and Length 20 or 30 Feet, it may be 5'' or 6'', and scarce\r\nabove. And this answers well to Experience: For some Astronomers have\r\nfound the Diameters of the fix'd Stars, in Telescopes of between 20 and\r\n60 Feet in length, to be about 5'' or 6'', or at most 8'' or 10'' in\r\ndiameter. But if the Eye-Glass be tincted faintly with the Smoak of a\r\nLamp or Torch, to obscure the Light of the Star, the fainter Light in\r\nthe Circumference of the Star ceases to be visible, and the Star (if the\r\nGlass be sufficiently soiled with Smoak) appears something more like a\r\nmathematical Point. And for the same Reason, the enormous Part of the\r\nLight in the Circumference of every lucid Point ought to be less\r\ndiscernible in shorter Telescopes than in longer, because the shorter\r\ntransmit less Light to the Eye.\r\n\r\nNow, that the fix'd Stars, by reason of their immense Distance, appear\r\nlike Points, unless so far as their Light is dilated by Refraction, may\r\nappear from hence; that when the Moon passes over them and eclipses\r\nthem, their Light vanishes, not gradually like that of the Planets, but\r\nall at once; and in the end of the Eclipse it returns into Sight all at\r\nonce, or certainly in less time than the second of a Minute; the\r\nRefraction of the Moon's Atmosphere a little protracting the time in\r\nwhich the Light of the Star first vanishes, and afterwards returns into\r\nSight.\r\n\r\nNow, if we suppose the sensible Image of a lucid Point, to be even 250\r\ntimes narrower than the Aperture of the Glass; yet this Image would be\r\nstill much greater than if it were only from the spherical Figure of the\r\nGlass. For were it not for the different Refrangibility of the Rays, its\r\nbreadth in an 100 Foot Telescope whose aperture is 4 Inches, would be\r\nbut 961/72000000 parts of an Inch, as is manifest by the foregoing\r\nComputation. And therefore in this case the greatest Errors arising from\r\nthe spherical Figure of the Glass, would be to the greatest sensible\r\nErrors arising from the different Refrangibility of the Rays as\r\n961/72000000 to 4/250 at most, that is only as 1 to 1200. And this\r\nsufficiently shews that it is not the spherical Figures of Glasses, but\r\nthe different Refrangibility of the Rays which hinders the perfection of\r\nTelescopes.\r\n\r\nThere is another Argument by which it may appear that the different\r\nRefrangibility of Rays, is the true cause of the imperfection of\r\nTelescopes. For the Errors of the Rays arising from the spherical\r\nFigures of Object-glasses, are as the Cubes of the Apertures of the\r\nObject Glasses; and thence to make Telescopes of various Lengths magnify\r\nwith equal distinctness, the Apertures of the Object-glasses, and the\r\nCharges or magnifying Powers ought to be as the Cubes of the square\r\nRoots of their lengths; which doth not answer to Experience. But the\r\nErrors of the Rays arising from the different Refrangibility, are as the\r\nApertures of the Object-glasses; and thence to make Telescopes of\r\nvarious lengths, magnify with equal distinctness, their Apertures and\r\nCharges ought to be as the square Roots of their lengths; and this\r\nanswers to Experience, as is well known. For Instance, a Telescope of 64\r\nFeet in length, with an Aperture of 2-2/3 Inches, magnifies about 120\r\ntimes, with as much distinctness as one of a Foot in length, with 1/3 of\r\nan Inch aperture, magnifies 15 times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nNow were it not for this different Refrangibility of Rays, Telescopes\r\nmight be brought to a greater perfection than we have yet describ'd, by\r\ncomposing the Object-glass of two Glasses with Water between them. Let\r\nADFC [in _Fig._ 28.] represent the Object-glass composed of two Glasses\r\nABED and BEFC, alike convex on the outsides AGD and CHF, and alike\r\nconcave on the insides BME, BNE, with Water in the concavity BMEN. Let\r\nthe Sine of Incidence out of Glass into Air be as I to R, and out of\r\nWater into Air, as K to R, and by consequence out of Glass into Water,\r\nas I to K: and let the Diameter of the Sphere to which the convex sides\r\nAGD and CHF are ground be D, and the Diameter of the Sphere to which the\r\nconcave sides BME and BNE, are ground be to D, as the Cube Root of\r\nKK--KI to the Cube Root of RK--RI: and the Refractions on the concave\r\nsides of the Glasses, will very much correct the Errors of the\r\nRefractions on the convex sides, so far as they arise from the\r\nsphericalness of the Figure. And by this means might Telescopes be\r\nbrought to sufficient perfection, were it not for the different\r\nRefrangibility of several sorts of Rays. But by reason of this different\r\nRefrangibility, I do not yet see any other means of improving Telescopes\r\nby Refractions alone, than that of increasing their lengths, for which\r\nend the late Contrivance of _Hugenius_ seems well accommodated. For very\r\nlong Tubes are cumbersome, and scarce to be readily managed, and by\r\nreason of their length are very apt to bend, and shake by bending, so as\r\nto cause a continual trembling in the Objects, whereby it becomes\r\ndifficult to see them distinctly: whereas by his Contrivance the Glasses\r\nare readily manageable, and the Object-glass being fix'd upon a strong\r\nupright Pole becomes more steady.\r\n\r\nSeeing therefore the Improvement of Telescopes of given lengths by\r\nRefractions is desperate; I contrived heretofore a Perspective by\r\nReflexion, using instead of an Object-glass a concave Metal. The\r\ndiameter of the Sphere to which the Metal was ground concave was about\r\n25 _English_ Inches, and by consequence the length of the Instrument\r\nabout six Inches and a quarter. The Eye-glass was Plano-convex, and the\r\ndiameter of the Sphere to which the convex side was ground was about 1/5\r\nof an Inch, or a little less, and by consequence it magnified between 30\r\nand 40 times. By another way of measuring I found that it magnified\r\nabout 35 times. The concave Metal bore an Aperture of an Inch and a\r\nthird part; but the Aperture was limited not by an opake Circle,\r\ncovering the Limb of the Metal round about, but by an opake Circle\r\nplaced between the Eyeglass and the Eye, and perforated in the middle\r\nwith a little round hole for the Rays to pass through to the Eye. For\r\nthis Circle by being placed here, stopp'd much of the erroneous Light,\r\nwhich otherwise would have disturbed the Vision. By comparing it with a\r\npretty good Perspective of four Feet in length, made with a concave\r\nEye-glass, I could read at a greater distance with my own Instrument\r\nthan with the Glass. Yet Objects appeared much darker in it than in the\r\nGlass, and that partly because more Light was lost by Reflexion in the\r\nMetal, than by Refraction in the Glass, and partly because my Instrument\r\nwas overcharged. Had it magnified but 30 or 25 times, it would have made\r\nthe Object appear more brisk and pleasant. Two of these I made about 16\r\nYears ago, and have one of them still by me, by which I can prove the\r\ntruth of what I write. Yet it is not so good as at the first. For the\r\nconcave has been divers times tarnished and cleared again, by rubbing\r\nit with very soft Leather. When I made these an Artist in _London_\r\nundertook to imitate it; but using another way of polishing them than I\r\ndid, he fell much short of what I had attained to, as I afterwards\r\nunderstood by discoursing the Under-workman he had employed. The Polish\r\nI used was in this manner. I had two round Copper Plates, each six\r\nInches in Diameter, the one convex, the other concave, ground very true\r\nto one another. On the convex I ground the Object-Metal or Concave which\r\nwas to be polish'd, 'till it had taken the Figure of the Convex and was\r\nready for a Polish. Then I pitched over the convex very thinly, by\r\ndropping melted Pitch upon it, and warming it to keep the Pitch soft,\r\nwhilst I ground it with the concave Copper wetted to make it spread\r\neavenly all over the convex. Thus by working it well I made it as thin\r\nas a Groat, and after the convex was cold I ground it again to give it\r\nas true a Figure as I could. Then I took Putty which I had made very\r\nfine by washing it from all its grosser Particles, and laying a little\r\nof this upon the Pitch, I ground it upon the Pitch with the concave\r\nCopper, till it had done making a Noise; and then upon the Pitch I\r\nground the Object-Metal with a brisk motion, for about two or three\r\nMinutes of time, leaning hard upon it. Then I put fresh Putty upon the\r\nPitch, and ground it again till it had done making a noise, and\r\nafterwards ground the Object-Metal upon it as before. And this Work I\r\nrepeated till the Metal was polished, grinding it the last time with all\r\nmy strength for a good while together, and frequently breathing upon\r\nthe Pitch, to keep it moist without laying on any more fresh Putty. The\r\nObject-Metal was two Inches broad, and about one third part of an Inch\r\nthick, to keep it from bending. I had two of these Metals, and when I\r\nhad polished them both, I tried which was best, and ground the other\r\nagain, to see if I could make it better than that which I kept. And thus\r\nby many Trials I learn'd the way of polishing, till I made those two\r\nreflecting Perspectives I spake of above. For this Art of polishing will\r\nbe better learn'd by repeated Practice than by my Description. Before I\r\nground the Object-Metal on the Pitch, I always ground the Putty on it\r\nwith the concave Copper, till it had done making a noise, because if the\r\nParticles of the Putty were not by this means made to stick fast in the\r\nPitch, they would by rolling up and down grate and fret the Object-Metal\r\nand fill it full of little holes.\r\n\r\nBut because Metal is more difficult to polish than Glass, and is\r\nafterwards very apt to be spoiled by tarnishing, and reflects not so\r\nmuch Light as Glass quick-silver'd over does: I would propound to use\r\ninstead of the Metal, a Glass ground concave on the foreside, and as\r\nmuch convex on the backside, and quick-silver'd over on the convex side.\r\nThe Glass must be every where of the same thickness exactly. Otherwise\r\nit will make Objects look colour'd and indistinct. By such a Glass I\r\ntried about five or six Years ago to make a reflecting Telescope of four\r\nFeet in length to magnify about 150 times, and I satisfied my self that\r\nthere wants nothing but a good Artist to bring the Design to\r\nperfection. For the Glass being wrought by one of our _London_ Artists\r\nafter such a manner as they grind Glasses for Telescopes, though it\r\nseemed as well wrought as the Object-glasses use to be, yet when it was\r\nquick-silver'd, the Reflexion discovered innumerable Inequalities all\r\nover the Glass. And by reason of these Inequalities, Objects appeared\r\nindistinct in this Instrument. For the Errors of reflected Rays caused\r\nby any Inequality of the Glass, are about six times greater than the\r\nErrors of refracted Rays caused by the like Inequalities. Yet by this\r\nExperiment I satisfied my self that the Reflexion on the concave side of\r\nthe Glass, which I feared would disturb the Vision, did no sensible\r\nprejudice to it, and by consequence that nothing is wanting to perfect\r\nthese Telescopes, but good Workmen who can grind and polish Glasses\r\ntruly spherical. An Object-glass of a fourteen Foot Telescope, made by\r\nan Artificer at _London_, I once mended considerably, by grinding it on\r\nPitch with Putty, and leaning very easily on it in the grinding, lest\r\nthe Putty should scratch it. Whether this way may not do well enough for\r\npolishing these reflecting Glasses, I have not yet tried. But he that\r\nshall try either this or any other way of polishing which he may think\r\nbetter, may do well to make his Glasses ready for polishing, by grinding\r\nthem without that Violence, wherewith our _London_ Workmen press their\r\nGlasses in grinding. For by such violent pressure, Glasses are apt to\r\nbend a little in the grinding, and such bending will certainly spoil\r\ntheir Figure. To recommend therefore the consideration of these\r\nreflecting Glasses to such Artists as are curious in figuring Glasses, I\r\nshall describe this optical Instrument in the following Proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ VIII. PROB. II.\r\n\r\n_To shorten Telescopes._\r\n\r\nLet ABCD [in _Fig._ 29.] represent a Glass spherically concave on the\r\nforeside AB, and as much convex on the backside CD, so that it be every\r\nwhere of an equal thickness. Let it not be thicker on one side than on\r\nthe other, lest it make Objects appear colour'd and indistinct, and let\r\nit be very truly wrought and quick-silver'd over on the backside; and\r\nset in the Tube VXYZ which must be very black within. Let EFG represent\r\na Prism of Glass or Crystal placed near the other end of the Tube, in\r\nthe middle of it, by means of a handle of Brass or Iron FGK, to the end\r\nof which made flat it is cemented. Let this Prism be rectangular at E,\r\nand let the other two Angles at F and G be accurately equal to each\r\nother, and by consequence equal to half right ones, and let the plane\r\nsides FE and GE be square, and by consequence the third side FG a\r\nrectangular Parallelogram, whose length is to its breadth in a\r\nsubduplicate proportion of two to one. Let it be so placed in the Tube,\r\nthat the Axis of the Speculum may pass through the middle of the square\r\nside EF perpendicularly and by consequence through the middle of the\r\nside FG at an Angle of 45 Degrees, and let the side EF be turned towards\r\nthe Speculum, and the distance of this Prism from the Speculum be such\r\nthat the Rays of the Light PQ, RS, &c. which are incident upon the\r\nSpeculum in Lines parallel to the Axis thereof, may enter the Prism at\r\nthe side EF, and be reflected by the side FG, and thence go out of it\r\nthrough the side GE, to the Point T, which must be the common Focus of\r\nthe Speculum ABDC, and of a Plano-convex Eye-glass H, through which\r\nthose Rays must pass to the Eye. And let the Rays at their coming out of\r\nthe Glass pass through a small round hole, or aperture made in a little\r\nplate of Lead, Brass, or Silver, wherewith the Glass is to be covered,\r\nwhich hole must be no bigger than is necessary for Light enough to pass\r\nthrough. For so it will render the Object distinct, the Plate in which\r\n'tis made intercepting all the erroneous part of the Light which comes\r\nfrom the verges of the Speculum AB. Such an Instrument well made, if it\r\nbe six Foot long, (reckoning the length from the Speculum to the Prism,\r\nand thence to the Focus T) will bear an aperture of six Inches at the\r\nSpeculum, and magnify between two and three hundred times. But the hole\r\nH here limits the aperture with more advantage, than if the aperture was\r\nplaced at the Speculum. If the Instrument be made longer or shorter, the\r\naperture must be in proportion as the Cube of the square-square Root of\r\nthe length, and the magnifying as the aperture. But it's convenient that\r\nthe Speculum be an Inch or two broader than the aperture at the least,\r\nand that the Glass of the Speculum be thick, that it bend not in the\r\nworking. The Prism EFG must be no bigger than is necessary, and its back\r\nside FG must not be quick-silver'd over. For without quicksilver it will\r\nreflect all the Light incident on it from the Speculum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\nIn this Instrument the Object will be inverted, but may be erected by\r\nmaking the square sides FF and EG of the Prism EFG not plane but\r\nspherically convex, that the Rays may cross as well before they come at\r\nit as afterwards between it and the Eye-glass. If it be desired that the\r\nInstrument bear a larger aperture, that may be also done by composing\r\nthe Speculum of two Glasses with Water between them.\r\n\r\nIf the Theory of making Telescopes could at length be fully brought into\r\nPractice, yet there would be certain Bounds beyond which Telescopes\r\ncould not perform. For the Air through which we look upon the Stars, is\r\nin a perpetual Tremor; as may be seen by the tremulous Motion of Shadows\r\ncast from high Towers, and by the twinkling of the fix'd Stars. But\r\nthese Stars do not twinkle when viewed through Telescopes which have\r\nlarge apertures. For the Rays of Light which pass through divers parts\r\nof the aperture, tremble each of them apart, and by means of their\r\nvarious and sometimes contrary Tremors, fall at one and the same time\r\nupon different points in the bottom of the Eye, and their trembling\r\nMotions are too quick and confused to be perceived severally. And all\r\nthese illuminated Points constitute one broad lucid Point, composed of\r\nthose many trembling Points confusedly and insensibly mixed with one\r\nanother by very short and swift Tremors, and thereby cause the Star to\r\nappear broader than it is, and without any trembling of the whole. Long\r\nTelescopes may cause Objects to appear brighter and larger than short\r\nones can do, but they cannot be so formed as to take away that confusion\r\nof the Rays which arises from the Tremors of the Atmosphere. The only\r\nRemedy is a most serene and quiet Air, such as may perhaps be found on\r\nthe tops of the highest Mountains above the grosser Clouds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] _See our_ Author's Lectiones Opticae Sec. 10. _Sect.

I.\r\n\r\n_The Phaenomena of Colours in refracted or reflected Light are not caused\r\nby new Modifications of the Light variously impress'd, according to the\r\nvarious Terminations of the Light and Shadow_.\r\n\r\nThe PROOF by Experiments.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 1. For if the Sun shine into a very dark Chamber through an\r\noblong hole F, [in _Fig._ 1.] whose breadth is the sixth or eighth part\r\nof an Inch, or something less; and his beam FH do afterwards pass first\r\nthrough a very large Prism ABC, distant about 20 Feet from the hole, and\r\nparallel to it, and then (with its white part) through an oblong hole H,\r\nwhose breadth is about the fortieth or sixtieth part of an Inch, and\r\nwhich is made in a black opake Body GI, and placed at the distance of\r\ntwo or three Feet from the Prism, in a parallel Situation both to the\r\nPrism and to the former hole, and if this white Light thus transmitted\r\nthrough the hole H, fall afterwards upon a white Paper _pt_, placed\r\nafter that hole H, at the distance of three or four Feet from it, and\r\nthere paint the usual Colours of the Prism, suppose red at _t_, yellow\r\nat _s_, green at _r_, blue at _q_, and violet at _p_; you may with an\r\nIron Wire, or any such like slender opake Body, whose breadth is about\r\nthe tenth part of an Inch, by intercepting the Rays at _k_, _l_, _m_,\r\n_n_ or _o_, take away any one of the Colours at _t_, _s_, _r_, _q_ or\r\n_p_, whilst the other Colours remain upon the Paper as before; or with\r\nan Obstacle something bigger you may take away any two, or three, or\r\nfour Colours together, the rest remaining: So that any one of the\r\nColours as well as violet may become outmost in the Confine of the\r\nShadow towards _p_, and any one of them as well as red may become\r\noutmost in the Confine of the Shadow towards _t_, and any one of them\r\nmay also border upon the Shadow made within the Colours by the Obstacle\r\nR intercepting some intermediate part of the Light; and, lastly, any one\r\nof them by being left alone, may border upon the Shadow on either hand.\r\nAll the Colours have themselves indifferently to any Confines of Shadow,\r\nand therefore the differences of these Colours from one another, do not\r\narise from the different Confines of Shadow, whereby Light is variously\r\nmodified, as has hitherto been the Opinion of Philosophers. In trying\r\nthese things 'tis to be observed, that by how much the holes F and H are\r\nnarrower, and the Intervals between them and the Prism greater, and the\r\nChamber darker, by so much the better doth the Experiment succeed;\r\nprovided the Light be not so far diminished, but that the Colours at\r\n_pt_ be sufficiently visible. To procure a Prism of solid Glass large\r\nenough for this Experiment will be difficult, and therefore a prismatick\r\nVessel must be made of polish'd Glass Plates cemented together, and\r\nfilled with salt Water or clear Oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 2. The Sun's Light let into a dark Chamber through the round\r\nhole F, [in _Fig._ 2.] half an Inch wide, passed first through the Prism\r\nABC placed at the hole, and then through a Lens PT something more than\r\nfour Inches broad, and about eight Feet distant from the Prism, and\r\nthence converged to O the Focus of the Lens distant from it about three\r\nFeet, and there fell upon a white Paper DE. If that Paper was\r\nperpendicular to that Light incident upon it, as 'tis represented in the\r\nposture DE, all the Colours upon it at O appeared white. But if the\r\nPaper being turned about an Axis parallel to the Prism, became very much\r\ninclined to the Light, as 'tis represented in the Positions _de_ and\r\n_[Greek: de]_; the same Light in the one case appeared yellow and red,\r\nin the other blue. Here one and the same part of the Light in one and\r\nthe same place, according to the various Inclinations of the Paper,\r\nappeared in one case white, in another yellow or red, in a third blue,\r\nwhilst the Confine of Light and shadow, and the Refractions of the Prism\r\nin all these cases remained the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 3. Such another Experiment may be more easily tried as follows.\r\nLet a broad beam of the Sun's Light coming into a dark Chamber through a\r\nhole in the Window-shut be refracted by a large Prism ABC, [in _Fig._\r\n3.] whose refracting Angle C is more than 60 Degrees, and so soon as it\r\ncomes out of the Prism, let it fall upon the white Paper DE glewed upon\r\na stiff Plane; and this Light, when the Paper is perpendicular to it, as\r\n'tis represented in DE, will appear perfectly white upon the Paper; but\r\nwhen the Paper is very much inclin'd to it in such a manner as to keep\r\nalways parallel to the Axis of the Prism, the whiteness of the whole\r\nLight upon the Paper will according to the inclination of the Paper this\r\nway or that way, change either into yellow and red, as in the posture\r\n_de_, or into blue and violet, as in the posture [Greek: de]. And if the\r\nLight before it fall upon the Paper be twice refracted the same way by\r\ntwo parallel Prisms, these Colours will become the more conspicuous.\r\nHere all the middle parts of the broad beam of white Light which fell\r\nupon the Paper, did without any Confine of Shadow to modify it, become\r\ncolour'd all over with one uniform Colour, the Colour being always the\r\nsame in the middle of the Paper as at the edges, and this Colour changed\r\naccording to the various Obliquity of the reflecting Paper, without any\r\nchange in the Refractions or Shadow, or in the Light which fell upon the\r\nPaper. And therefore these Colours are to be derived from some other\r\nCause than the new Modifications of Light by Refractions and Shadows.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked, what then is their Cause? I answer, That the Paper in\r\nthe posture _de_, being more oblique to the more refrangible Rays than\r\nto the less refrangible ones, is more strongly illuminated by the latter\r\nthan by the former, and therefore the less refrangible Rays are\r\npredominant in the reflected Light. And where-ever they are predominant\r\nin any Light, they tinge it with red or yellow, as may in some measure\r\nappear by the first Proposition of the first Part of this Book, and will\r\nmore fully appear hereafter. And the contrary happens in the posture of\r\nthe Paper [Greek: de], the more refrangible Rays being then predominant\r\nwhich always tinge Light with blues and violets.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 4. The Colours of Bubbles with which Children play are various,\r\nand change their Situation variously, without any respect to any Confine\r\nor Shadow. If such a Bubble be cover'd with a concave Glass, to keep it\r\nfrom being agitated by any Wind or Motion of the Air, the Colours will\r\nslowly and regularly change their situation, even whilst the Eye and the\r\nBubble, and all Bodies which emit any Light, or cast any Shadow, remain\r\nunmoved. And therefore their Colours arise from some regular Cause which\r\ndepends not on any Confine of Shadow. What this Cause is will be shewed\r\nin the next Book.\r\n\r\nTo these Experiments may be added the tenth Experiment of the first Part\r\nof this first Book, where the Sun's Light in a dark Room being\r\ntrajected through the parallel Superficies of two Prisms tied together\r\nin the form of a Parallelopipede, became totally of one uniform yellow\r\nor red Colour, at its emerging out of the Prisms. Here, in the\r\nproduction of these Colours, the Confine of Shadow can have nothing to\r\ndo. For the Light changes from white to yellow, orange and red\r\nsuccessively, without any alteration of the Confine of Shadow: And at\r\nboth edges of the emerging Light where the contrary Confines of Shadow\r\nought to produce different Effects, the Colour is one and the same,\r\nwhether it be white, yellow, orange or red: And in the middle of the\r\nemerging Light, where there is no Confine of Shadow at all, the Colour\r\nis the very same as at the edges, the whole Light at its very first\r\nEmergence being of one uniform Colour, whether white, yellow, orange or\r\nred, and going on thence perpetually without any change of Colour, such\r\nas the Confine of Shadow is vulgarly supposed to work in refracted Light\r\nafter its Emergence. Neither can these Colours arise from any new\r\nModifications of the Light by Refractions, because they change\r\nsuccessively from white to yellow, orange and red, while the Refractions\r\nremain the same, and also because the Refractions are made contrary ways\r\nby parallel Superficies which destroy one another's Effects. They arise\r\nnot therefore from any Modifications of Light made by Refractions and\r\nShadows, but have some other Cause. What that Cause is we shewed above\r\nin this tenth Experiment, and need not here repeat it.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another material Circumstance of this Experiment. For this\r\nemerging Light being by a third Prism HIK [in _Fig._ 22. _Part_ I.][I]\r\nrefracted towards the Paper PT, and there painting the usual Colours of\r\nthe Prism, red, yellow, green, blue, violet: If these Colours arose from\r\nthe Refractions of that Prism modifying the Light, they would not be in\r\nthe Light before its Incidence on that Prism. And yet in that Experiment\r\nwe found, that when by turning the two first Prisms about their common\r\nAxis all the Colours were made to vanish but the red; the Light which\r\nmakes that red being left alone, appeared of the very same red Colour\r\nbefore its Incidence on the third Prism. And in general we find by other\r\nExperiments, that when the Rays which differ in Refrangibility are\r\nseparated from one another, and any one Sort of them is considered\r\napart, the Colour of the Light which they compose cannot be changed by\r\nany Refraction or Reflexion whatever, as it ought to be were Colours\r\nnothing else than Modifications of Light caused by Refractions, and\r\nReflexions, and Shadows. This Unchangeableness of Colour I am now to\r\ndescribe in the following Proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ II. THEOR. II.\r\n\r\n_All homogeneal Light has its proper Colour answering to its Degree of\r\nRefrangibility, and that Colour cannot be changed by Reflexions and\r\nRefractions._\r\n\r\nIn the Experiments of the fourth Proposition of the first Part of this\r\nfirst Book, when I had separated the heterogeneous Rays from one\r\nanother, the Spectrum _pt_ formed by the separated Rays, did in the\r\nProgress from its End _p_, on which the most refrangible Rays fell, unto\r\nits other End _t_, on which the least refrangible Rays fell, appear\r\ntinged with this Series of Colours, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow,\r\norange, red, together with all their intermediate Degrees in a continual\r\nSuccession perpetually varying. So that there appeared as many Degrees\r\nof Colours, as there were sorts of Rays differing in Refrangibility.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 5. Now, that these Colours could not be changed by Refraction,\r\nI knew by refracting with a Prism sometimes one very little Part of this\r\nLight, sometimes another very little Part, as is described in the\r\ntwelfth Experiment of the first Part of this Book. For by this\r\nRefraction the Colour of the Light was never changed in the least. If\r\nany Part of the red Light was refracted, it remained totally of the same\r\nred Colour as before. No orange, no yellow, no green or blue, no other\r\nnew Colour was produced by that Refraction. Neither did the Colour any\r\nways change by repeated Refractions, but continued always the same red\r\nentirely as at first. The like Constancy and Immutability I found also\r\nin the blue, green, and other Colours. So also, if I looked through a\r\nPrism upon any Body illuminated with any part of this homogeneal Light,\r\nas in the fourteenth Experiment of the first Part of this Book is\r\ndescribed; I could not perceive any new Colour generated this way. All\r\nBodies illuminated with compound Light appear through Prisms confused,\r\n(as was said above) and tinged with various new Colours, but those\r\nilluminated with homogeneal Light appeared through Prisms neither less\r\ndistinct, nor otherwise colour'd, than when viewed with the naked Eyes.\r\nTheir Colours were not in the least changed by the Refraction of the\r\ninterposed Prism. I speak here of a sensible Change of Colour: For the\r\nLight which I here call homogeneal, being not absolutely homogeneal,\r\nthere ought to arise some little Change of Colour from its\r\nHeterogeneity. But, if that Heterogeneity was so little as it might be\r\nmade by the said Experiments of the fourth Proposition, that Change was\r\nnot sensible, and therefore in Experiments, where Sense is Judge, ought\r\nto be accounted none at all.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 6. And as these Colours were not changeable by Refractions, so\r\nneither were they by Reflexions. For all white, grey, red, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, violet Bodies, as Paper, Ashes, red Lead, Orpiment, Indico\r\nBise, Gold, Silver, Copper, Grass, blue Flowers, Violets, Bubbles of\r\nWater tinged with various Colours, Peacock's Feathers, the Tincture of\r\n_Lignum Nephriticum_, and such-like, in red homogeneal Light appeared\r\ntotally red, in blue Light totally blue, in green Light totally green,\r\nand so of other Colours. In the homogeneal Light of any Colour they all\r\nappeared totally of that same Colour, with this only Difference, that\r\nsome of them reflected that Light more strongly, others more faintly. I\r\nnever yet found any Body, which by reflecting homogeneal Light could\r\nsensibly change its Colour.\r\n\r\nFrom all which it is manifest, that if the Sun's Light consisted of but\r\none sort of Rays, there would be but one Colour in the whole World, nor\r\nwould it be possible to produce any new Colour by Reflexions and\r\nRefractions, and by consequence that the variety of Colours depends upon\r\nthe Composition of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\n_DEFINITION._\r\n\r\nThe homogeneal Light and Rays which appear red, or rather make Objects\r\nappear so, I call Rubrifick or Red-making; those which make Objects\r\nappear yellow, green, blue, and violet, I call Yellow-making,\r\nGreen-making, Blue-making, Violet-making, and so of the rest. And if at\r\nany time I speak of Light and Rays as coloured or endued with Colours, I\r\nwould be understood to speak not philosophically and properly, but\r\ngrossly, and accordingly to such Conceptions as vulgar People in seeing\r\nall these Experiments would be apt to frame. For the Rays to speak\r\nproperly are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain\r\nPower and Disposition to stir up a Sensation of this or that Colour.\r\nFor as Sound in a Bell or musical String, or other sounding Body, is\r\nnothing but a trembling Motion, and in the Air nothing but that Motion\r\npropagated from the Object, and in the Sensorium 'tis a Sense of that\r\nMotion under the Form of Sound; so Colours in the Object are nothing but\r\na Disposition to reflect this or that sort of Rays more copiously than\r\nthe rest; in the Rays they are nothing but their Dispositions to\r\npropagate this or that Motion into the Sensorium, and in the Sensorium\r\nthey are Sensations of those Motions under the Forms of Colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ III. PROB. I.\r\n\r\n_To define the Refrangibility of the several sorts of homogeneal Light\r\nanswering to the several Colours._\r\n\r\nFor determining this Problem I made the following Experiment.[J]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 7. When I had caused the Rectilinear Sides AF, GM, [in _Fig._\r\n4.] of the Spectrum of Colours made by the Prism to be distinctly\r\ndefined, as in the fifth Experiment of the first Part of this Book is\r\ndescribed, there were found in it all the homogeneal Colours in the same\r\nOrder and Situation one among another as in the Spectrum of simple\r\nLight, described in the fourth Proposition of that Part. For the Circles\r\nof which the Spectrum of compound Light PT is composed, and which in\r\nthe middle Parts of the Spectrum interfere, and are intermix'd with one\r\nanother, are not intermix'd in their outmost Parts where they touch\r\nthose Rectilinear Sides AF and GM. And therefore, in those Rectilinear\r\nSides when distinctly defined, there is no new Colour generated by\r\nRefraction. I observed also, that if any where between the two outmost\r\nCircles TMF and PGA a Right Line, as [Greek: gd], was cross to the\r\nSpectrum, so as both Ends to fall perpendicularly upon its Rectilinear\r\nSides, there appeared one and the same Colour, and degree of Colour from\r\none End of this Line to the other. I delineated therefore in a Paper the\r\nPerimeter of the Spectrum FAP GMT, and in trying the third Experiment of\r\nthe first Part of this Book, I held the Paper so that the Spectrum might\r\nfall upon this delineated Figure, and agree with it exactly, whilst an\r\nAssistant, whose Eyes for distinguishing Colours were more critical than\r\nmine, did by Right Lines [Greek: ab, gd, ez,] &c. drawn cross the\r\nSpectrum, note the Confines of the Colours, that is of the red M[Greek:\r\nab]F, of the orange [Greek: agdb], of the yellow [Greek: gezd], of the\r\ngreen [Greek: eethz], of the blue [Greek: eikth], of the indico [Greek:\r\nilmk], and of the violet [Greek: l]GA[Greek: m]. And this Operation\r\nbeing divers times repeated both in the same, and in several Papers, I\r\nfound that the Observations agreed well enough with one another, and\r\nthat the Rectilinear Sides MG and FA were by the said cross Lines\r\ndivided after the manner of a Musical Chord. Let GM be produced to X,\r\nthat MX may be equal to GM, and conceive GX, [Greek: l]X, [Greek: i]X,\r\n[Greek: e]X, [Greek: e]X, [Greek: g]X, [Greek: a]X, MX, to be in\r\nproportion to one another, as the Numbers, 1, 8/9, 5/6, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5,\r\n9/16, 1/2, and so to represent the Chords of the Key, and of a Tone, a\r\nthird Minor, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth Major, a seventh and an eighth\r\nabove that Key: And the Intervals M[Greek: a], [Greek: ag], [Greek: ge],\r\n[Greek: ee], [Greek: ei], [Greek: il], and [Greek: l]G, will be the\r\nSpaces which the several Colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue,\r\nindigo, violet) take up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nNow these Intervals or Spaces subtending the Differences of the\r\nRefractions of the Rays going to the Limits of those Colours, that is,\r\nto the Points M, [Greek: a], [Greek: g], [Greek: e], [Greek: e], [Greek:\r\ni], [Greek: l], G, may without any sensible Error be accounted\r\nproportional to the Differences of the Sines of Refraction of those Rays\r\nhaving one common Sine of Incidence, and therefore since the common Sine\r\nof Incidence of the most and least refrangible Rays out of Glass into\r\nAir was (by a Method described above) found in proportion to their Sines\r\nof Refraction, as 50 to 77 and 78, divide the Difference between the\r\nSines of Refraction 77 and 78, as the Line GM is divided by those\r\nIntervals, and you will have 77, 77-1/8, 77-1/5, 77-1/3, 77-1/2, 77-2/3,\r\n77-7/9, 78, the Sines of Refraction of those Rays out of Glass into Air,\r\ntheir common Sine of Incidence being 50. So then the Sines of the\r\nIncidences of all the red-making Rays out of Glass into Air, were to the\r\nSines of their Refractions, not greater than 50 to 77, nor less than 50\r\nto 77-1/8, but they varied from one another according to all\r\nintermediate Proportions. And the Sines of the Incidences of the\r\ngreen-making Rays were to the Sines of their Refractions in all\r\nProportions from that of 50 to 77-1/3, unto that of 50 to 77-1/2. And\r\nby the like Limits above-mentioned were the Refractions of the Rays\r\nbelonging to the rest of the Colours defined, the Sines of the\r\nred-making Rays extending from 77 to 77-1/8, those of the orange-making\r\nfrom 77-1/8 to 77-1/5, those of the yellow-making from 77-1/5 to 77-1/3,\r\nthose of the green-making from 77-1/3 to 77-1/2, those of the\r\nblue-making from 77-1/2 to 77-2/3, those of the indigo-making from\r\n77-2/3 to 77-7/9, and those of the violet from 77-7/9, to 78.\r\n\r\nThese are the Laws of the Refractions made out of Glass into Air, and\r\nthence by the third Axiom of the first Part of this Book, the Laws of\r\nthe Refractions made out of Air into Glass are easily derived.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 8. I found moreover, that when Light goes out of Air through\r\nseveral contiguous refracting Mediums as through Water and Glass, and\r\nthence goes out again into Air, whether the refracting Superficies be\r\nparallel or inclin'd to one another, that Light as often as by contrary\r\nRefractions 'tis so corrected, that it emergeth in Lines parallel to\r\nthose in which it was incident, continues ever after to be white. But if\r\nthe emergent Rays be inclined to the incident, the Whiteness of the\r\nemerging Light will by degrees in passing on from the Place of\r\nEmergence, become tinged in its Edges with Colours. This I try'd by\r\nrefracting Light with Prisms of Glass placed within a Prismatick Vessel\r\nof Water. Now those Colours argue a diverging and separation of the\r\nheterogeneous Rays from one another by means of their unequal\r\nRefractions, as in what follows will more fully appear. And, on the\r\ncontrary, the permanent whiteness argues, that in like Incidences of the\r\nRays there is no such separation of the emerging Rays, and by\r\nconsequence no inequality of their whole Refractions. Whence I seem to\r\ngather the two following Theorems.\r\n\r\n1. The Excesses of the Sines of Refraction of several sorts of Rays\r\nabove their common Sine of Incidence when the Refractions are made out\r\nof divers denser Mediums immediately into one and the same rarer Medium,\r\nsuppose of Air, are to one another in a given Proportion.\r\n\r\n2. The Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction of\r\none and the same sort of Rays out of one Medium into another, is\r\ncomposed of the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of\r\nRefraction out of the first Medium into any third Medium, and of the\r\nProportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction out of\r\nthat third Medium into the second Medium.\r\n\r\nBy the first Theorem the Refractions of the Rays of every sort made out\r\nof any Medium into Air are known by having the Refraction of the Rays of\r\nany one sort. As for instance, if the Refractions of the Rays of every\r\nsort out of Rain-water into Air be desired, let the common Sine of\r\nIncidence out of Glass into Air be subducted from the Sines of\r\nRefraction, and the Excesses will be 27, 27-1/8, 27-1/5, 27-1/3, 27-1/2,\r\n27-2/3, 27-7/9, 28. Suppose now that the Sine of Incidence of the least\r\nrefrangible Rays be to their Sine of Refraction out of Rain-water into\r\nAir as 3 to 4, and say as 1 the difference of those Sines is to 3 the\r\nSine of Incidence, so is 27 the least of the Excesses above-mentioned to\r\na fourth Number 81; and 81 will be the common Sine of Incidence out of\r\nRain-water into Air, to which Sine if you add all the above-mentioned\r\nExcesses, you will have the desired Sines of the Refractions 108,\r\n108-1/8, 108-1/5, 108-1/3, 108-1/2, 108-2/3, 108-7/9, 109.\r\n\r\nBy the latter Theorem the Refraction out of one Medium into another is\r\ngathered as often as you have the Refractions out of them both into any\r\nthird Medium. As if the Sine of Incidence of any Ray out of Glass into\r\nAir be to its Sine of Refraction, as 20 to 31, and the Sine of Incidence\r\nof the same Ray out of Air into Water, be to its Sine of Refraction as 4\r\nto 3; the Sine of Incidence of that Ray out of Glass into Water will be\r\nto its Sine of Refraction as 20 to 31 and 4 to 3 jointly, that is, as\r\nthe Factum of 20 and 4 to the Factum of 31 and 3, or as 80 to 93.\r\n\r\nAnd these Theorems being admitted into Opticks, there would be scope\r\nenough of handling that Science voluminously after a new manner,[K] not\r\nonly by teaching those things which tend to the perfection of Vision,\r\nbut also by determining mathematically all kinds of Phaenomena of Colours\r\nwhich could be produced by Refractions. For to do this, there is nothing\r\nelse requisite than to find out the Separations of heterogeneous Rays,\r\nand their various Mixtures and Proportions in every Mixture. By this\r\nway of arguing I invented almost all the Phaenomena described in these\r\nBooks, beside some others less necessary to the Argument; and by the\r\nsuccesses I met with in the Trials, I dare promise, that to him who\r\nshall argue truly, and then try all things with good Glasses and\r\nsufficient Circumspection, the expected Event will not be wanting. But\r\nhe is first to know what Colours will arise from any others mix'd in any\r\nassigned Proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ IV. THEOR. III.\r\n\r\n_Colours may be produced by Composition which shall be like to the\r\nColours of homogeneal Light as to the Appearance of Colour, but not as\r\nto the Immutability of Colour and Constitution of Light. And those\r\nColours by how much they are more compounded by so much are they less\r\nfull and intense, and by too much Composition they maybe diluted and\r\nweaken'd till they cease, and the Mixture becomes white or grey. There\r\nmay be also Colours produced by Composition, which are not fully like\r\nany of the Colours of homogeneal Light._\r\n\r\nFor a Mixture of homogeneal red and yellow compounds an Orange, like in\r\nappearance of Colour to that orange which in the series of unmixed\r\nprismatick Colours lies between them; but the Light of one orange is\r\nhomogeneal as to Refrangibility, and that of the other is heterogeneal,\r\nand the Colour of the one, if viewed through a Prism, remains unchanged,\r\nthat of the other is changed and resolved into its component Colours red\r\nand yellow. And after the same manner other neighbouring homogeneal\r\nColours may compound new Colours, like the intermediate homogeneal ones,\r\nas yellow and green, the Colour between them both, and afterwards, if\r\nblue be added, there will be made a green the middle Colour of the three\r\nwhich enter the Composition. For the yellow and blue on either hand, if\r\nthey are equal in quantity they draw the intermediate green equally\r\ntowards themselves in Composition, and so keep it as it were in\r\nAEquilibrion, that it verge not more to the yellow on the one hand, and\r\nto the blue on the other, but by their mix'd Actions remain still a\r\nmiddle Colour. To this mix'd green there may be farther added some red\r\nand violet, and yet the green will not presently cease, but only grow\r\nless full and vivid, and by increasing the red and violet, it will grow\r\nmore and more dilute, until by the prevalence of the added Colours it be\r\novercome and turned into whiteness, or some other Colour. So if to the\r\nColour of any homogeneal Light, the Sun's white Light composed of all\r\nsorts of Rays be added, that Colour will not vanish or change its\r\nSpecies, but be diluted, and by adding more and more white it will be\r\ndiluted more and more perpetually. Lastly, If red and violet be mingled,\r\nthere will be generated according to their various Proportions various\r\nPurples, such as are not like in appearance to the Colour of any\r\nhomogeneal Light, and of these Purples mix'd with yellow and blue may be\r\nmade other new Colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ V. THEOR. IV.\r\n\r\n_Whiteness and all grey Colours between white and black, may be\r\ncompounded of Colours, and the whiteness of the Sun's Light is\r\ncompounded of all the primary Colours mix'd in a due Proportion._\r\n\r\nThe PROOF by Experiments.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 9. The Sun shining into a dark Chamber through a little round\r\nhole in the Window-shut, and his Light being there refracted by a Prism\r\nto cast his coloured Image PT [in _Fig._ 5.] upon the opposite Wall: I\r\nheld a white Paper V to that image in such manner that it might be\r\nilluminated by the colour'd Light reflected from thence, and yet not\r\nintercept any part of that Light in its passage from the Prism to the\r\nSpectrum. And I found that when the Paper was held nearer to any Colour\r\nthan to the rest, it appeared of that Colour to which it approached\r\nnearest; but when it was equally or almost equally distant from all the\r\nColours, so that it might be equally illuminated by them all it appeared\r\nwhite. And in this last situation of the Paper, if some Colours were\r\nintercepted, the Paper lost its white Colour, and appeared of the Colour\r\nof the rest of the Light which was not intercepted. So then the Paper\r\nwas illuminated with Lights of various Colours, namely, red, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue and violet, and every part of the Light retained its proper\r\nColour, until it was incident on the Paper, and became reflected thence\r\nto the Eye; so that if it had been either alone (the rest of the Light\r\nbeing intercepted) or if it had abounded most, and been predominant in\r\nthe Light reflected from the Paper, it would have tinged the Paper with\r\nits own Colour; and yet being mixed with the rest of the Colours in a\r\ndue proportion, it made the Paper look white, and therefore by a\r\nComposition with the rest produced that Colour. The several parts of the\r\ncoloured Light reflected from the Spectrum, whilst they are propagated\r\nfrom thence through the Air, do perpetually retain their proper Colours,\r\nbecause wherever they fall upon the Eyes of any Spectator, they make the\r\nseveral parts of the Spectrum to appear under their proper Colours. They\r\nretain therefore their proper Colours when they fall upon the Paper V,\r\nand so by the confusion and perfect mixture of those Colours compound\r\nthe whiteness of the Light reflected from thence.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 10. Let that Spectrum or solar Image PT [in _Fig._ 6.] fall now\r\nupon the Lens MN above four Inches broad, and about six Feet distant\r\nfrom the Prism ABC and so figured that it may cause the coloured Light\r\nwhich divergeth from the Prism to converge and meet again at its Focus\r\nG, about six or eight Feet distant from the Lens, and there to fall\r\nperpendicularly upon a white Paper DE. And if you move this Paper to and\r\nfro, you will perceive that near the Lens, as at _de_, the whole solar\r\nImage (suppose at _pt_) will appear upon it intensely coloured after the\r\nmanner above-explained, and that by receding from the Lens those Colours\r\nwill perpetually come towards one another, and by mixing more and more\r\ndilute one another continually, until at length the Paper come to the\r\nFocus G, where by a perfect mixture they will wholly vanish and be\r\nconverted into whiteness, the whole Light appearing now upon the Paper\r\nlike a little white Circle. And afterwards by receding farther from the\r\nLens, the Rays which before converged will now cross one another in the\r\nFocus G, and diverge from thence, and thereby make the Colours to appear\r\nagain, but yet in a contrary order; suppose at [Greek: de], where the\r\nred _t_ is now above which before was below, and the violet _p_ is below\r\nwhich before was above.\r\n\r\nLet us now stop the Paper at the Focus G, where the Light appears\r\ntotally white and circular, and let us consider its whiteness. I say,\r\nthat this is composed of the converging Colours. For if any of those\r\nColours be intercepted at the Lens, the whiteness will cease and\r\ndegenerate into that Colour which ariseth from the composition of the\r\nother Colours which are not intercepted. And then if the intercepted\r\nColours be let pass and fall upon that compound Colour, they mix with\r\nit, and by their mixture restore the whiteness. So if the violet, blue\r\nand green be intercepted, the remaining yellow, orange and red will\r\ncompound upon the Paper an orange, and then if the intercepted Colours\r\nbe let pass, they will fall upon this compounded orange, and together\r\nwith it decompound a white. So also if the red and violet be\r\nintercepted, the remaining yellow, green and blue, will compound a green\r\nupon the Paper, and then the red and violet being let pass will fall\r\nupon this green, and together with it decompound a white. And that in\r\nthis Composition of white the several Rays do not suffer any Change in\r\ntheir colorific Qualities by acting upon one another, but are only\r\nmixed, and by a mixture of their Colours produce white, may farther\r\nappear by these Arguments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nIf the Paper be placed beyond the Focus G, suppose at [Greek: de], and\r\nthen the red Colour at the Lens be alternately intercepted, and let pass\r\nagain, the violet Colour on the Paper will not suffer any Change\r\nthereby, as it ought to do if the several sorts of Rays acted upon one\r\nanother in the Focus G, where they cross. Neither will the red upon the\r\nPaper be changed by any alternate stopping, and letting pass the violet\r\nwhich crosseth it.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Paper be placed at the Focus G, and the white round Image at\r\nG be viewed through the Prism HIK, and by the Refraction of that Prism\r\nbe translated to the place _rv_, and there appear tinged with various\r\nColours, namely, the violet at _v_ and red at _r_, and others between,\r\nand then the red Colours at the Lens be often stopp'd and let pass by\r\nturns, the red at _r_ will accordingly disappear, and return as often,\r\nbut the violet at _v_ will not thereby suffer any Change. And so by\r\nstopping and letting pass alternately the blue at the Lens, the blue at\r\n_v_ will accordingly disappear and return, without any Change made in\r\nthe red at _r_. The red therefore depends on one sort of Rays, and the\r\nblue on another sort, which in the Focus G where they are commix'd, do\r\nnot act on one another. And there is the same Reason of the other\r\nColours.\r\n\r\nI considered farther, that when the most refrangible Rays P_p_, and the\r\nleast refrangible ones T_t_, are by converging inclined to one another,\r\nthe Paper, if held very oblique to those Rays in the Focus G, might\r\nreflect one sort of them more copiously than the other sort, and by that\r\nMeans the reflected Light would be tinged in that Focus with the Colour\r\nof the predominant Rays, provided those Rays severally retained their\r\nColours, or colorific Qualities in the Composition of White made by them\r\nin that Focus. But if they did not retain them in that White, but became\r\nall of them severally endued there with a Disposition to strike the\r\nSense with the Perception of White, then they could never lose their\r\nWhiteness by such Reflexions. I inclined therefore the Paper to the Rays\r\nvery obliquely, as in the second Experiment of this second Part of the\r\nfirst Book, that the most refrangible Rays, might be more copiously\r\nreflected than the rest, and the Whiteness at Length changed\r\nsuccessively into blue, indigo, and violet. Then I inclined it the\r\ncontrary Way, that the least refrangible Rays might be more copious in\r\nthe reflected Light than the rest, and the Whiteness turned successively\r\nto yellow, orange, and red.\r\n\r\nLastly, I made an Instrument XY in fashion of a Comb, whose Teeth being\r\nin number sixteen, were about an Inch and a half broad, and the\r\nIntervals of the Teeth about two Inches wide. Then by interposing\r\nsuccessively the Teeth of this Instrument near the Lens, I intercepted\r\nPart of the Colours by the interposed Tooth, whilst the rest of them\r\nwent on through the Interval of the Teeth to the Paper DE, and there\r\npainted a round Solar Image. But the Paper I had first placed so, that\r\nthe Image might appear white as often as the Comb was taken away; and\r\nthen the Comb being as was said interposed, that Whiteness by reason of\r\nthe intercepted Part of the Colours at the Lens did always change into\r\nthe Colour compounded of those Colours which were not intercepted, and\r\nthat Colour was by the Motion of the Comb perpetually varied so, that in\r\nthe passing of every Tooth over the Lens all these Colours, red, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, and purple, did always succeed one another. I caused\r\ntherefore all the Teeth to pass successively over the Lens, and when the\r\nMotion was slow, there appeared a perpetual Succession of the Colours\r\nupon the Paper: But if I so much accelerated the Motion, that the\r\nColours by reason of their quick Succession could not be distinguished\r\nfrom one another, the Appearance of the single Colours ceased. There was\r\nno red, no yellow, no green, no blue, nor purple to be seen any longer,\r\nbut from a Confusion of them all there arose one uniform white Colour.\r\nOf the Light which now by the Mixture of all the Colours appeared white,\r\nthere was no Part really white. One Part was red, another yellow, a\r\nthird green, a fourth blue, a fifth purple, and every Part retains its\r\nproper Colour till it strike the Sensorium. If the Impressions follow\r\none another slowly, so that they may be severally perceived, there is\r\nmade a distinct Sensation of all the Colours one after another in a\r\ncontinual Succession. But if the Impressions follow one another so\r\nquickly, that they cannot be severally perceived, there ariseth out of\r\nthem all one common Sensation, which is neither of this Colour alone nor\r\nof that alone, but hath it self indifferently to 'em all, and this is a\r\nSensation of Whiteness. By the Quickness of the Successions, the\r\nImpressions of the several Colours are confounded in the Sensorium, and\r\nout of that Confusion ariseth a mix'd Sensation. If a burning Coal be\r\nnimbly moved round in a Circle with Gyrations continually repeated, the\r\nwhole Circle will appear like Fire; the reason of which is, that the\r\nSensation of the Coal in the several Places of that Circle remains\r\nimpress'd on the Sensorium, until the Coal return again to the same\r\nPlace. And so in a quick Consecution of the Colours the Impression of\r\nevery Colour remains in the Sensorium, until a Revolution of all the\r\nColours be compleated, and that first Colour return again. The\r\nImpressions therefore of all the successive Colours are at once in the\r\nSensorium, and jointly stir up a Sensation of them all; and so it is\r\nmanifest by this Experiment, that the commix'd Impressions of all the\r\nColours do stir up and beget a Sensation of white, that is, that\r\nWhiteness is compounded of all the Colours.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Comb be now taken away, that all the Colours may at once pass\r\nfrom the Lens to the Paper, and be there intermixed, and together\r\nreflected thence to the Spectator's Eyes; their Impressions on the\r\nSensorium being now more subtilly and perfectly commixed there, ought\r\nmuch more to stir up a Sensation of Whiteness.\r\n\r\nYou may instead of the Lens use two Prisms HIK and LMN, which by\r\nrefracting the coloured Light the contrary Way to that of the first\r\nRefraction, may make the diverging Rays converge and meet again in G, as\r\nyou see represented in the seventh Figure. For where they meet and mix,\r\nthey will compose a white Light, as when a Lens is used.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 11. Let the Sun's coloured Image PT [in _Fig._ 8.] fall upon\r\nthe Wall of a dark Chamber, as in the third Experiment of the first\r\nBook, and let the same be viewed through a Prism _abc_, held parallel to\r\nthe Prism ABC, by whose Refraction that Image was made, and let it now\r\nappear lower than before, suppose in the Place S over-against the red\r\nColour T. And if you go near to the Image PT, the Spectrum S will appear\r\noblong and coloured like the Image PT; but if you recede from it, the\r\nColours of the spectrum S will be contracted more and more, and at\r\nlength vanish, that Spectrum S becoming perfectly round and white; and\r\nif you recede yet farther, the Colours will emerge again, but in a\r\ncontrary Order. Now that Spectrum S appears white in that Case, when the\r\nRays of several sorts which converge from the several Parts of the Image\r\nPT, to the Prism _abc_, are so refracted unequally by it, that in their\r\nPassage from the Prism to the Eye they may diverge from one and the same\r\nPoint of the Spectrum S, and so fall afterwards upon one and the same\r\nPoint in the bottom of the Eye, and there be mingled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nAnd farther, if the Comb be here made use of, by whose Teeth the Colours\r\nat the Image PT may be successively intercepted; the Spectrum S, when\r\nthe Comb is moved slowly, will be perpetually tinged with successive\r\nColours: But when by accelerating the Motion of the Comb, the Succession\r\nof the Colours is so quick that they cannot be severally seen, that\r\nSpectrum S, by a confused and mix'd Sensation of them all, will appear\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 12. The Sun shining through a large Prism ABC [in _Fig._ 9.]\r\nupon a Comb XY, placed immediately behind the Prism, his Light which\r\npassed through the Interstices of the Teeth fell upon a white Paper DE.\r\nThe Breadths of the Teeth were equal to their Interstices, and seven\r\nTeeth together with their Interstices took up an Inch in Breadth. Now,\r\nwhen the Paper was about two or three Inches distant from the Comb, the\r\nLight which passed through its several Interstices painted so many\r\nRanges of Colours, _kl_, _mn_, _op_, _qr_, &c. which were parallel to\r\none another, and contiguous, and without any Mixture of white. And these\r\nRanges of Colours, if the Comb was moved continually up and down with a\r\nreciprocal Motion, ascended and descended in the Paper, and when the\r\nMotion of the Comb was so quick, that the Colours could not be\r\ndistinguished from one another, the whole Paper by their Confusion and\r\nMixture in the Sensorium appeared white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nLet the Comb now rest, and let the Paper be removed farther from the\r\nPrism, and the several Ranges of Colours will be dilated and expanded\r\ninto one another more and more, and by mixing their Colours will dilute\r\none another, and at length, when the distance of the Paper from the Comb\r\nis about a Foot, or a little more (suppose in the Place 2D 2E) they will\r\nso far dilute one another, as to become white.\r\n\r\nWith any Obstacle, let all the Light be now stopp'd which passes through\r\nany one Interval of the Teeth, so that the Range of Colours which comes\r\nfrom thence may be taken away, and you will see the Light of the rest of\r\nthe Ranges to be expanded into the Place of the Range taken away, and\r\nthere to be coloured. Let the intercepted Range pass on as before, and\r\nits Colours falling upon the Colours of the other Ranges, and mixing\r\nwith them, will restore the Whiteness.\r\n\r\nLet the Paper 2D 2E be now very much inclined to the Rays, so that the\r\nmost refrangible Rays may be more copiously reflected than the rest, and\r\nthe white Colour of the Paper through the Excess of those Rays will be\r\nchanged into blue and violet. Let the Paper be as much inclined the\r\ncontrary way, that the least refrangible Rays may be now more copiously\r\nreflected than the rest, and by their Excess the Whiteness will be\r\nchanged into yellow and red. The several Rays therefore in that white\r\nLight do retain their colorific Qualities, by which those of any sort,\r\nwhenever they become more copious than the rest, do by their Excess and\r\nPredominance cause their proper Colour to appear.\r\n\r\nAnd by the same way of arguing, applied to the third Experiment of this\r\nsecond Part of the first Book, it may be concluded, that the white\r\nColour of all refracted Light at its very first Emergence, where it\r\nappears as white as before its Incidence, is compounded of various\r\nColours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 13. In the foregoing Experiment the several Intervals of the\r\nTeeth of the Comb do the Office of so many Prisms, every Interval\r\nproducing the Phaenomenon of one Prism. Whence instead of those Intervals\r\nusing several Prisms, I try'd to compound Whiteness by mixing their\r\nColours, and did it by using only three Prisms, as also by using only\r\ntwo as follows. Let two Prisms ABC and _abc_, [in _Fig._ 10.] whose\r\nrefracting Angles B and _b_ are equal, be so placed parallel to one\r\nanother, that the refracting Angle B of the one may touch the Angle _c_\r\nat the Base of the other, and their Planes CB and _cb_, at which the\r\nRays emerge, may lie in Directum. Then let the Light trajected through\r\nthem fall upon the Paper MN, distant about 8 or 12 Inches from the\r\nPrisms. And the Colours generated by the interior Limits B and _c_ of\r\nthe two Prisms, will be mingled at PT, and there compound white. For if\r\neither Prism be taken away, the Colours made by the other will appear in\r\nthat Place PT, and when the Prism is restored to its Place again, so\r\nthat its Colours may there fall upon the Colours of the other, the\r\nMixture of them both will restore the Whiteness.\r\n\r\nThis Experiment succeeds also, as I have tried, when the Angle _b_ of\r\nthe lower Prism, is a little greater than the Angle B of the upper, and\r\nbetween the interior Angles B and _c_, there intercedes some Space B_c_,\r\nas is represented in the Figure, and the refracting Planes BC and _bc_,\r\nare neither in Directum, nor parallel to one another. For there is\r\nnothing more requisite to the Success of this Experiment, than that the\r\nRays of all sorts may be uniformly mixed upon the Paper in the Place PT.\r\nIf the most refrangible Rays coming from the superior Prism take up all\r\nthe Space from M to P, the Rays of the same sort which come from the\r\ninferior Prism ought to begin at P, and take up all the rest of the\r\nSpace from thence towards N. If the least refrangible Rays coming from\r\nthe superior Prism take up the Space MT, the Rays of the same kind which\r\ncome from the other Prism ought to begin at T, and take up the\r\nremaining Space TN. If one sort of the Rays which have intermediate\r\nDegrees of Refrangibility, and come from the superior Prism be extended\r\nthrough the Space MQ, and another sort of those Rays through the Space\r\nMR, and a third sort of them through the Space MS, the same sorts of\r\nRays coming from the lower Prism, ought to illuminate the remaining\r\nSpaces QN, RN, SN, respectively. And the same is to be understood of all\r\nthe other sorts of Rays. For thus the Rays of every sort will be\r\nscattered uniformly and evenly through the whole Space MN, and so being\r\nevery where mix'd in the same Proportion, they must every where produce\r\nthe same Colour. And therefore, since by this Mixture they produce white\r\nin the Exterior Spaces MP and TN, they must also produce white in the\r\nInterior Space PT. This is the reason of the Composition by which\r\nWhiteness was produced in this Experiment, and by what other way soever\r\nI made the like Composition, the Result was Whiteness.\r\n\r\nLastly, If with the Teeth of a Comb of a due Size, the coloured Lights\r\nof the two Prisms which fall upon the Space PT be alternately\r\nintercepted, that Space PT, when the Motion of the Comb is slow, will\r\nalways appear coloured, but by accelerating the Motion of the Comb so\r\nmuch that the successive Colours cannot be distinguished from one\r\nanother, it will appear white.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 14. Hitherto I have produced Whiteness by mixing the Colours of\r\nPrisms. If now the Colours of natural Bodies are to be mingled, let\r\nWater a little thicken'd with Soap be agitated to raise a Froth, and\r\nafter that Froth has stood a little, there will appear to one that shall\r\nview it intently various Colours every where in the Surfaces of the\r\nseveral Bubbles; but to one that shall go so far off, that he cannot\r\ndistinguish the Colours from one another, the whole Froth will grow\r\nwhite with a perfect Whiteness.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 15. Lastly, In attempting to compound a white, by mixing the\r\ncoloured Powders which Painters use, I consider'd that all colour'd\r\nPowders do suppress and stop in them a very considerable Part of the\r\nLight by which they are illuminated. For they become colour'd by\r\nreflecting the Light of their own Colours more copiously, and that of\r\nall other Colours more sparingly, and yet they do not reflect the Light\r\nof their own Colours so copiously as white Bodies do. If red Lead, for\r\ninstance, and a white Paper, be placed in the red Light of the colour'd\r\nSpectrum made in a dark Chamber by the Refraction of a Prism, as is\r\ndescribed in the third Experiment of the first Part of this Book; the\r\nPaper will appear more lucid than the red Lead, and therefore reflects\r\nthe red-making Rays more copiously than red Lead doth. And if they be\r\nheld in the Light of any other Colour, the Light reflected by the Paper\r\nwill exceed the Light reflected by the red Lead in a much greater\r\nProportion. And the like happens in Powders of other Colours. And\r\ntherefore by mixing such Powders, we are not to expect a strong and\r\nfull White, such as is that of Paper, but some dusky obscure one, such\r\nas might arise from a Mixture of Light and Darkness, or from white and\r\nblack, that is, a grey, or dun, or russet brown, such as are the Colours\r\nof a Man's Nail, of a Mouse, of Ashes, of ordinary Stones, of Mortar, of\r\nDust and Dirt in High-ways, and the like. And such a dark white I have\r\noften produced by mixing colour'd Powders. For thus one Part of red\r\nLead, and five Parts of _Viride AEris_, composed a dun Colour like that\r\nof a Mouse. For these two Colours were severally so compounded of\r\nothers, that in both together were a Mixture of all Colours; and there\r\nwas less red Lead used than _Viride AEris_, because of the Fulness of its\r\nColour. Again, one Part of red Lead, and four Parts of blue Bise,\r\ncomposed a dun Colour verging a little to purple, and by adding to this\r\na certain Mixture of Orpiment and _Viride AEris_ in a due Proportion, the\r\nMixture lost its purple Tincture, and became perfectly dun. But the\r\nExperiment succeeded best without Minium thus. To Orpiment I added by\r\nlittle and little a certain full bright purple, which Painters use,\r\nuntil the Orpiment ceased to be yellow, and became of a pale red. Then I\r\ndiluted that red by adding a little _Viride AEris_, and a little more\r\nblue Bise than _Viride AEris_, until it became of such a grey or pale\r\nwhite, as verged to no one of the Colours more than to another. For thus\r\nit became of a Colour equal in Whiteness to that of Ashes, or of Wood\r\nnewly cut, or of a Man's Skin. The Orpiment reflected more Light than\r\ndid any other of the Powders, and therefore conduced more to the\r\nWhiteness of the compounded Colour than they. To assign the Proportions\r\naccurately may be difficult, by reason of the different Goodness of\r\nPowders of the same kind. Accordingly, as the Colour of any Powder is\r\nmore or less full and luminous, it ought to be used in a less or greater\r\nProportion.\r\n\r\nNow, considering that these grey and dun Colours may be also produced by\r\nmixing Whites and Blacks, and by consequence differ from perfect Whites,\r\nnot in Species of Colours, but only in degree of Luminousness, it is\r\nmanifest that there is nothing more requisite to make them perfectly\r\nwhite than to increase their Light sufficiently; and, on the contrary,\r\nif by increasing their Light they can be brought to perfect Whiteness,\r\nit will thence also follow, that they are of the same Species of Colour\r\nwith the best Whites, and differ from them only in the Quantity of\r\nLight. And this I tried as follows. I took the third of the\r\nabove-mention'd grey Mixtures, (that which was compounded of Orpiment,\r\nPurple, Bise, and _Viride AEris_) and rubbed it thickly upon the Floor of\r\nmy Chamber, where the Sun shone upon it through the opened Casement; and\r\nby it, in the shadow, I laid a Piece of white Paper of the same Bigness.\r\nThen going from them to the distance of 12 or 18 Feet, so that I could\r\nnot discern the Unevenness of the Surface of the Powder, nor the little\r\nShadows let fall from the gritty Particles thereof; the Powder appeared\r\nintensely white, so as to transcend even the Paper it self in Whiteness,\r\nespecially if the Paper were a little shaded from the Light of the\r\nClouds, and then the Paper compared with the Powder appeared of such a\r\ngrey Colour as the Powder had done before. But by laying the Paper where\r\nthe Sun shines through the Glass of the Window, or by shutting the\r\nWindow that the Sun might shine through the Glass upon the Powder, and\r\nby such other fit Means of increasing or decreasing the Lights wherewith\r\nthe Powder and Paper were illuminated, the Light wherewith the Powder is\r\nilluminated may be made stronger in such a due Proportion than the Light\r\nwherewith the Paper is illuminated, that they shall both appear exactly\r\nalike in Whiteness. For when I was trying this, a Friend coming to visit\r\nme, I stopp'd him at the Door, and before I told him what the Colours\r\nwere, or what I was doing; I asked him, Which of the two Whites were the\r\nbest, and wherein they differed? And after he had at that distance\r\nviewed them well, he answer'd, that they were both good Whites, and that\r\nhe could not say which was best, nor wherein their Colours differed.\r\nNow, if you consider, that this White of the Powder in the Sun-shine was\r\ncompounded of the Colours which the component Powders (Orpiment, Purple,\r\nBise, and _Viride AEris_) have in the same Sun-shine, you must\r\nacknowledge by this Experiment, as well as by the former, that perfect\r\nWhiteness may be compounded of Colours.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it is also evident, that the Whiteness of the\r\nSun's Light is compounded of all the Colours wherewith the several sorts\r\nof Rays whereof that Light consists, when by their several\r\nRefrangibilities they are separated from one another, do tinge Paper or\r\nany other white Body whereon they fall. For those Colours (by _Prop._\r\nII. _Part_ 2.) are unchangeable, and whenever all those Rays with those\r\ntheir Colours are mix'd again, they reproduce the same white Light as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ VI. PROB. II.\r\n\r\n_In a mixture of Primary Colours, the Quantity and Quality of each being\r\ngiven, to know the Colour of the Compound._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nWith the Center O [in _Fig._ 11.] and Radius OD describe a Circle ADF,\r\nand distinguish its Circumference into seven Parts DE, EF, FG, GA, AB,\r\nBC, CD, proportional to the seven Musical Tones or Intervals of the\r\neight Sounds, _Sol_, _la_, _fa_, _sol_, _la_, _mi_, _fa_, _sol_,\r\ncontained in an eight, that is, proportional to the Number 1/9, 1/16,\r\n1/10, 1/9, 1/16, 1/16, 1/9. Let the first Part DE represent a red\r\nColour, the second EF orange, the third FG yellow, the fourth CA green,\r\nthe fifth AB blue, the sixth BC indigo, and the seventh CD violet. And\r\nconceive that these are all the Colours of uncompounded Light gradually\r\npassing into one another, as they do when made by Prisms; the\r\nCircumference DEFGABCD, representing the whole Series of Colours from\r\none end of the Sun's colour'd Image to the other, so that from D to E be\r\nall degrees of red, at E the mean Colour between red and orange, from E\r\nto F all degrees of orange, at F the mean between orange and yellow,\r\nfrom F to G all degrees of yellow, and so on. Let _p_ be the Center of\r\nGravity of the Arch DE, and _q_, _r_, _s_, _t_, _u_, _x_, the Centers of\r\nGravity of the Arches EF, FG, GA, AB, BC, and CD respectively, and about\r\nthose Centers of Gravity let Circles proportional to the Number of Rays\r\nof each Colour in the given Mixture be describ'd: that is, the Circle\r\n_p_ proportional to the Number of the red-making Rays in the Mixture,\r\nthe Circle _q_ proportional to the Number of the orange-making Rays in\r\nthe Mixture, and so of the rest. Find the common Center of Gravity of\r\nall those Circles, _p_, _q_, _r_, _s_, _t_, _u_, _x_. Let that Center be\r\nZ; and from the Center of the Circle ADF, through Z to the\r\nCircumference, drawing the Right Line OY, the Place of the Point Y in\r\nthe Circumference shall shew the Colour arising from the Composition of\r\nall the Colours in the given Mixture, and the Line OZ shall be\r\nproportional to the Fulness or Intenseness of the Colour, that is, to\r\nits distance from Whiteness. As if Y fall in the middle between F and G,\r\nthe compounded Colour shall be the best yellow; if Y verge from the\r\nmiddle towards F or G, the compound Colour shall accordingly be a\r\nyellow, verging towards orange or green. If Z fall upon the\r\nCircumference, the Colour shall be intense and florid in the highest\r\nDegree; if it fall in the mid-way between the Circumference and Center,\r\nit shall be but half so intense, that is, it shall be such a Colour as\r\nwould be made by diluting the intensest yellow with an equal quantity of\r\nwhiteness; and if it fall upon the center O, the Colour shall have lost\r\nall its intenseness, and become a white. But it is to be noted, That if\r\nthe point Z fall in or near the line OD, the main ingredients being the\r\nred and violet, the Colour compounded shall not be any of the prismatick\r\nColours, but a purple, inclining to red or violet, accordingly as the\r\npoint Z lieth on the side of the line DO towards E or towards C, and in\r\ngeneral the compounded violet is more bright and more fiery than the\r\nuncompounded. Also if only two of the primary Colours which in the\r\ncircle are opposite to one another be mixed in an equal proportion, the\r\npoint Z shall fall upon the center O, and yet the Colour compounded of\r\nthose two shall not be perfectly white, but some faint anonymous Colour.\r\nFor I could never yet by mixing only two primary Colours produce a\r\nperfect white. Whether it may be compounded of a mixture of three taken\r\nat equal distances in the circumference I do not know, but of four or\r\nfive I do not much question but it may. But these are Curiosities of\r\nlittle or no moment to the understanding the Phaenomena of Nature. For in\r\nall whites produced by Nature, there uses to be a mixture of all sorts\r\nof Rays, and by consequence a composition of all Colours.\r\n\r\nTo give an instance of this Rule; suppose a Colour is compounded of\r\nthese homogeneal Colours, of violet one part, of indigo one part, of\r\nblue two parts, of green three parts, of yellow five parts, of orange\r\nsix parts, and of red ten parts. Proportional to these parts describe\r\nthe Circles _x_, _v_, _t_, _s_, _r_, _q_, _p_, respectively, that is, so\r\nthat if the Circle _x_ be one, the Circle _v_ may be one, the Circle _t_\r\ntwo, the Circle _s_ three, and the Circles _r_, _q_ and _p_, five, six\r\nand ten. Then I find Z the common center of gravity of these Circles,\r\nand through Z drawing the Line OY, the Point Y falls upon the\r\ncircumference between E and F, something nearer to E than to F, and\r\nthence I conclude, that the Colour compounded of these Ingredients will\r\nbe an orange, verging a little more to red than to yellow. Also I find\r\nthat OZ is a little less than one half of OY, and thence I conclude,\r\nthat this orange hath a little less than half the fulness or intenseness\r\nof an uncompounded orange; that is to say, that it is such an orange as\r\nmay be made by mixing an homogeneal orange with a good white in the\r\nproportion of the Line OZ to the Line ZY, this Proportion being not of\r\nthe quantities of mixed orange and white Powders, but of the quantities\r\nof the Lights reflected from them.\r\n\r\nThis Rule I conceive accurate enough for practice, though not\r\nmathematically accurate; and the truth of it may be sufficiently proved\r\nto Sense, by stopping any of the Colours at the Lens in the tenth\r\nExperiment of this Book. For the rest of the Colours which are not\r\nstopp'd, but pass on to the Focus of the Lens, will there compound\r\neither accurately or very nearly such a Colour, as by this Rule ought to\r\nresult from their Mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ VII. THEOR. V.\r\n\r\n_All the Colours in the Universe which are made by Light, and depend not\r\non the Power of Imagination, are either the Colours of homogeneal\r\nLights, or compounded of these, and that either accurately or very\r\nnearly, according to the Rule of the foregoing Problem._\r\n\r\nFor it has been proved (in _Prop. 1. Part 2._) that the changes of\r\nColours made by Refractions do not arise from any new Modifications of\r\nthe Rays impress'd by those Refractions, and by the various Terminations\r\nof Light and Shadow, as has been the constant and general Opinion of\r\nPhilosophers. It has also been proved that the several Colours of the\r\nhomogeneal Rays do constantly answer to their degrees of Refrangibility,\r\n(_Prop._ 1. _Part_ 1. and _Prop._ 2. _Part_ 2.) and that their degrees\r\nof Refrangibility cannot be changed by Refractions and Reflexions\r\n(_Prop._ 2. _Part_ 1.) and by consequence that those their Colours are\r\nlikewise immutable. It has also been proved directly by refracting and\r\nreflecting homogeneal Lights apart, that their Colours cannot be\r\nchanged, (_Prop._ 2. _Part_ 2.) It has been proved also, that when the\r\nseveral sorts of Rays are mixed, and in crossing pass through the same\r\nspace, they do not act on one another so as to change each others\r\ncolorific qualities. (_Exper._ 10. _Part_ 2.) but by mixing their\r\nActions in the Sensorium beget a Sensation differing from what either\r\nwould do apart, that is a Sensation of a mean Colour between their\r\nproper Colours; and particularly when by the concourse and mixtures of\r\nall sorts of Rays, a white Colour is produced, the white is a mixture of\r\nall the Colours which the Rays would have apart, (_Prop._ 5. _Part_ 2.)\r\nThe Rays in that mixture do not lose or alter their several colorific\r\nqualities, but by all their various kinds of Actions mix'd in the\r\nSensorium, beget a Sensation of a middling Colour between all their\r\nColours, which is whiteness. For whiteness is a mean between all\r\nColours, having it self indifferently to them all, so as with equal\r\nfacility to be tinged with any of them. A red Powder mixed with a little\r\nblue, or a blue with a little red, doth not presently lose its Colour,\r\nbut a white Powder mix'd with any Colour is presently tinged with that\r\nColour, and is equally capable of being tinged with any Colour whatever.\r\nIt has been shewed also, that as the Sun's Light is mix'd of all sorts\r\nof Rays, so its whiteness is a mixture of the Colours of all sorts of\r\nRays; those Rays having from the beginning their several colorific\r\nqualities as well as their several Refrangibilities, and retaining them\r\nperpetually unchanged notwithstanding any Refractions or Reflexions they\r\nmay at any time suffer, and that whenever any sort of the Sun's Rays is\r\nby any means (as by Reflexion in _Exper._ 9, and 10. _Part_ 1. or by\r\nRefraction as happens in all Refractions) separated from the rest, they\r\nthen manifest their proper Colours. These things have been prov'd, and\r\nthe sum of all this amounts to the Proposition here to be proved. For if\r\nthe Sun's Light is mix'd of several sorts of Rays, each of which have\r\noriginally their several Refrangibilities and colorific Qualities, and\r\nnotwithstanding their Refractions and Reflexions, and their various\r\nSeparations or Mixtures, keep those their original Properties\r\nperpetually the same without alteration; then all the Colours in the\r\nWorld must be such as constantly ought to arise from the original\r\ncolorific qualities of the Rays whereof the Lights consist by which\r\nthose Colours are seen. And therefore if the reason of any Colour\r\nwhatever be required, we have nothing else to do than to consider how\r\nthe Rays in the Sun's Light have by Reflexions or Refractions, or other\r\ncauses, been parted from one another, or mixed together; or otherwise to\r\nfind out what sorts of Rays are in the Light by which that Colour is\r\nmade, and in what Proportion; and then by the last Problem to learn the\r\nColour which ought to arise by mixing those Rays (or their Colours) in\r\nthat proportion. I speak here of Colours so far as they arise from\r\nLight. For they appear sometimes by other Causes, as when by the power\r\nof Phantasy we see Colours in a Dream, or a Mad-man sees things before\r\nhim which are not there; or when we see Fire by striking the Eye, or see\r\nColours like the Eye of a Peacock's Feather, by pressing our Eyes in\r\neither corner whilst we look the other way. Where these and such like\r\nCauses interpose not, the Colour always answers to the sort or sorts of\r\nthe Rays whereof the Light consists, as I have constantly found in\r\nwhatever Phaenomena of Colours I have hitherto been able to examine. I\r\nshall in the following Propositions give instances of this in the\r\nPhaenomena of chiefest note.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ VIII. PROB. III.\r\n\r\n_By the discovered Properties of Light to explain the Colours made by\r\nPrisms._\r\n\r\nLet ABC [in _Fig._ 12.] represent a Prism refracting the Light of the\r\nSun, which comes into a dark Chamber through a hole F[Greek: ph] almost\r\nas broad as the Prism, and let MN represent a white Paper on which the\r\nrefracted Light is cast, and suppose the most refrangible or deepest\r\nviolet-making Rays fall upon the Space P[Greek: p], the least\r\nrefrangible or deepest red-making Rays upon the Space T[Greek: t], the\r\nmiddle sort between the indigo-making and blue-making Rays upon the\r\nSpace Q[Greek: ch], the middle sort of the green-making Rays upon the\r\nSpace R, the middle sort between the yellow-making and orange-making\r\nRays upon the Space S[Greek: s], and other intermediate sorts upon\r\nintermediate Spaces. For so the Spaces upon which the several sorts\r\nadequately fall will by reason of the different Refrangibility of those\r\nsorts be one lower than another. Now if the Paper MN be so near the\r\nPrism that the Spaces PT and [Greek: pt] do not interfere with one\r\nanother, the distance between them T[Greek: p] will be illuminated by\r\nall the sorts of Rays in that proportion to one another which they have\r\nat their very first coming out of the Prism, and consequently be white.\r\nBut the Spaces PT and [Greek: pt] on either hand, will not be\r\nilluminated by them all, and therefore will appear coloured. And\r\nparticularly at P, where the outmost violet-making Rays fall alone, the\r\nColour must be the deepest violet. At Q where the violet-making and\r\nindigo-making Rays are mixed, it must be a violet inclining much to\r\nindigo. At R where the violet-making, indigo-making, blue-making, and\r\none half of the green-making Rays are mixed, their Colours must (by the\r\nconstruction of the second Problem) compound a middle Colour between\r\nindigo and blue. At S where all the Rays are mixed, except the\r\nred-making and orange-making, their Colours ought by the same Rule to\r\ncompound a faint blue, verging more to green than indigo. And in the\r\nprogress from S to T, this blue will grow more and more faint and\r\ndilute, till at T, where all the Colours begin to be mixed, it ends in\r\nwhiteness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nSo again, on the other side of the white at [Greek: t], where the least\r\nrefrangible or utmost red-making Rays are alone, the Colour must be the\r\ndeepest red. At [Greek: s] the mixture of red and orange will compound a\r\nred inclining to orange. At [Greek: r] the mixture of red, orange,\r\nyellow, and one half of the green must compound a middle Colour between\r\norange and yellow. At [Greek: ch] the mixture of all Colours but violet\r\nand indigo will compound a faint yellow, verging more to green than to\r\norange. And this yellow will grow more faint and dilute continually in\r\nits progress from [Greek: ch] to [Greek: p], where by a mixture of all\r\nsorts of Rays it will become white.\r\n\r\nThese Colours ought to appear were the Sun's Light perfectly white: But\r\nbecause it inclines to yellow, the Excess of the yellow-making Rays\r\nwhereby 'tis tinged with that Colour, being mixed with the faint blue\r\nbetween S and T, will draw it to a faint green. And so the Colours in\r\norder from P to [Greek: t] ought to be violet, indigo, blue, very faint\r\ngreen, white, faint yellow, orange, red. Thus it is by the computation:\r\nAnd they that please to view the Colours made by a Prism will find it so\r\nin Nature.\r\n\r\nThese are the Colours on both sides the white when the Paper is held\r\nbetween the Prism and the Point X where the Colours meet, and the\r\ninterjacent white vanishes. For if the Paper be held still farther off\r\nfrom the Prism, the most refrangible and least refrangible Rays will be\r\nwanting in the middle of the Light, and the rest of the Rays which are\r\nfound there, will by mixture produce a fuller green than before. Also\r\nthe yellow and blue will now become less compounded, and by consequence\r\nmore intense than before. And this also agrees with experience.\r\n\r\nAnd if one look through a Prism upon a white Object encompassed with\r\nblackness or darkness, the reason of the Colours arising on the edges is\r\nmuch the same, as will appear to one that shall a little consider it. If\r\na black Object be encompassed with a white one, the Colours which appear\r\nthrough the Prism are to be derived from the Light of the white one,\r\nspreading into the Regions of the black, and therefore they appear in a\r\ncontrary order to that, when a white Object is surrounded with black.\r\nAnd the same is to be understood when an Object is viewed, whose parts\r\nare some of them less luminous than others. For in the borders of the\r\nmore and less luminous Parts, Colours ought always by the same\r\nPrinciples to arise from the Excess of the Light of the more luminous,\r\nand to be of the same kind as if the darker parts were black, but yet to\r\nbe more faint and dilute.\r\n\r\nWhat is said of Colours made by Prisms may be easily applied to Colours\r\nmade by the Glasses of Telescopes or Microscopes, or by the Humours of\r\nthe Eye. For if the Object-glass of a Telescope be thicker on one side\r\nthan on the other, or if one half of the Glass, or one half of the Pupil\r\nof the Eye be cover'd with any opake substance; the Object-glass, or\r\nthat part of it or of the Eye which is not cover'd, may be consider'd as\r\na Wedge with crooked Sides, and every Wedge of Glass or other pellucid\r\nSubstance has the effect of a Prism in refracting the Light which passes\r\nthrough it.[L]\r\n\r\nHow the Colours in the ninth and tenth Experiments of the first Part\r\narise from the different Reflexibility of Light, is evident by what was\r\nthere said. But it is observable in the ninth Experiment, that whilst\r\nthe Sun's direct Light is yellow, the Excess of the blue-making Rays in\r\nthe reflected beam of Light MN, suffices only to bring that yellow to a\r\npale white inclining to blue, and not to tinge it with a manifestly blue\r\nColour. To obtain therefore a better blue, I used instead of the yellow\r\nLight of the Sun the white Light of the Clouds, by varying a little the\r\nExperiment, as follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 16 Let HFG [in _Fig._ 13.] represent a Prism in the open Air,\r\nand S the Eye of the Spectator, viewing the Clouds by their Light coming\r\ninto the Prism at the Plane Side FIGK, and reflected in it by its Base\r\nHEIG, and thence going out through its Plane Side HEFK to the Eye. And\r\nwhen the Prism and Eye are conveniently placed, so that the Angles of\r\nIncidence and Reflexion at the Base may be about 40 Degrees, the\r\nSpectator will see a Bow MN of a blue Colour, running from one End of\r\nthe Base to the other, with the Concave Side towards him, and the Part\r\nof the Base IMNG beyond this Bow will be brighter than the other Part\r\nEMNH on the other Side of it. This blue Colour MN being made by nothing\r\nelse than by Reflexion of a specular Superficies, seems so odd a\r\nPhaenomenon, and so difficult to be explained by the vulgar Hypothesis of\r\nPhilosophers, that I could not but think it deserved to be taken Notice\r\nof. Now for understanding the Reason of it, suppose the Plane ABC to cut\r\nthe Plane Sides and Base of the Prism perpendicularly. From the Eye to\r\nthe Line BC, wherein that Plane cuts the Base, draw the Lines S_p_ and\r\nS_t_, in the Angles S_pc_ 50 degr. 1/9, and S_tc_ 49 degr. 1/28, and the\r\nPoint _p_ will be the Limit beyond which none of the most refrangible\r\nRays can pass through the Base of the Prism, and be refracted, whose\r\nIncidence is such that they may be reflected to the Eye; and the Point\r\n_t_ will be the like Limit for the least refrangible Rays, that is,\r\nbeyond which none of them can pass through the Base, whose Incidence is\r\nsuch that by Reflexion they may come to the Eye. And the Point _r_ taken\r\nin the middle Way between _p_ and _t_, will be the like Limit for the\r\nmeanly refrangible Rays. And therefore all the least refrangible Rays\r\nwhich fall upon the Base beyond _t_, that is, between _t_ and B, and can\r\ncome from thence to the Eye, will be reflected thither: But on this side\r\n_t_, that is, between _t_ and _c_, many of these Rays will be\r\ntransmitted through the Base. And all the most refrangible Rays which\r\nfall upon the Base beyond _p_, that is, between, _p_ and B, and can by\r\nReflexion come from thence to the Eye, will be reflected thither, but\r\nevery where between _p_ and _c_, many of these Rays will get through the\r\nBase, and be refracted; and the same is to be understood of the meanly\r\nrefrangible Rays on either side of the Point _r_. Whence it follows,\r\nthat the Base of the Prism must every where between _t_ and B, by a\r\ntotal Reflexion of all sorts of Rays to the Eye, look white and bright.\r\nAnd every where between _p_ and C, by reason of the Transmission of many\r\nRays of every sort, look more pale, obscure, and dark. But at _r_, and\r\nin other Places between _p_ and _t_, where all the more refrangible Rays\r\nare reflected to the Eye, and many of the less refrangible are\r\ntransmitted, the Excess of the most refrangible in the reflected Light\r\nwill tinge that Light with their Colour, which is violet and blue. And\r\nthis happens by taking the Line C _prt_ B any where between the Ends of\r\nthe Prism HG and EI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ IX. PROB. IV.\r\n\r\n_By the discovered Properties of Light to explain the Colours of the\r\nRain-bow._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nThis Bow never appears, but where it rains in the Sun-shine, and may be\r\nmade artificially by spouting up Water which may break aloft, and\r\nscatter into Drops, and fall down like Rain. For the Sun shining upon\r\nthese Drops certainly causes the Bow to appear to a Spectator standing\r\nin a due Position to the Rain and Sun. And hence it is now agreed upon,\r\nthat this Bow is made by Refraction of the Sun's Light in drops of\r\nfalling Rain. This was understood by some of the Antients, and of late\r\nmore fully discover'd and explain'd by the famous _Antonius de Dominis_\r\nArchbishop of _Spalato_, in his book _De Radiis Visus & Lucis_,\r\npublished by his Friend _Bartolus_ at _Venice_, in the Year 1611, and\r\nwritten above 20 Years before. For he teaches there how the interior Bow\r\nis made in round Drops of Rain by two Refractions of the Sun's Light,\r\nand one Reflexion between them, and the exterior by two Refractions, and\r\ntwo sorts of Reflexions between them in each Drop of Water, and proves\r\nhis Explications by Experiments made with a Phial full of Water, and\r\nwith Globes of Glass filled with Water, and placed in the Sun to make\r\nthe Colours of the two Bows appear in them. The same Explication\r\n_Des-Cartes_ hath pursued in his Meteors, and mended that of the\r\nexterior Bow. But whilst they understood not the true Origin of Colours,\r\nit's necessary to pursue it here a little farther. For understanding\r\ntherefore how the Bow is made, let a Drop of Rain, or any other\r\nspherical transparent Body be represented by the Sphere BNFG, [in _Fig._\r\n14.] described with the Center C, and Semi-diameter CN. And let AN be\r\none of the Sun's Rays incident upon it at N, and thence refracted to F,\r\nwhere let it either go out of the Sphere by Refraction towards V, or be\r\nreflected to G; and at G let it either go out by Refraction to R, or be\r\nreflected to H; and at H let it go out by Refraction towards S, cutting\r\nthe incident Ray in Y. Produce AN and RG, till they meet in X, and upon\r\nAX and NF, let fall the Perpendiculars CD and CE, and produce CD till it\r\nfall upon the Circumference at L. Parallel to the incident Ray AN draw\r\nthe Diameter BQ, and let the Sine of Incidence out of Air into Water be\r\nto the Sine of Refraction as I to R. Now, if you suppose the Point of\r\nIncidence N to move from the Point B, continually till it come to L, the\r\nArch QF will first increase and then decrease, and so will the Angle AXR\r\nwhich the Rays AN and GR contain; and the Arch QF and Angle AXR will be\r\nbiggest when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(3)RR, in which\r\ncase NE will be to ND as 2R to I. Also the Angle AYS, which the Rays AN\r\nand HS contain will first decrease, and then increase and grow least\r\nwhen ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(8)RR, in which case NE\r\nwill be to ND, as 3R to I. And so the Angle which the next emergent Ray\r\n(that is, the emergent Ray after three Reflexions) contains with the\r\nincident Ray AN will come to its Limit when ND is to CN as sqrt(II -\r\nRR) to sqrt(15)RR, in which case NE will be to ND as 4R to I. And the\r\nAngle which the Ray next after that Emergent, that is, the Ray emergent\r\nafter four Reflexions, contains with the Incident, will come to its\r\nLimit, when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(24)RR, in which\r\ncase NE will be to ND as 5R to I; and so on infinitely, the Numbers 3,\r\n8, 15, 24, &c. being gather'd by continual Addition of the Terms of the\r\narithmetical Progression 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. The Truth of all this\r\nMathematicians will easily examine.[M]\r\n\r\nNow it is to be observed, that as when the Sun comes to his Tropicks,\r\nDays increase and decrease but a very little for a great while together;\r\nso when by increasing the distance CD, these Angles come to their\r\nLimits, they vary their quantity but very little for some time together,\r\nand therefore a far greater number of the Rays which fall upon all the\r\nPoints N in the Quadrant BL, shall emerge in the Limits of these Angles,\r\nthan in any other Inclinations. And farther it is to be observed, that\r\nthe Rays which differ in Refrangibility will have different Limits of\r\ntheir Angles of Emergence, and by consequence according to their\r\ndifferent Degrees of Refrangibility emerge most copiously in different\r\nAngles, and being separated from one another appear each in their proper\r\nColours. And what those Angles are may be easily gather'd from the\r\nforegoing Theorem by Computation.\r\n\r\nFor in the least refrangible Rays the Sines I and R (as was found above)\r\nare 108 and 81, and thence by Computation the greatest Angle AXR will be\r\nfound 42 Degrees and 2 Minutes, and the least Angle AYS, 50 Degrees and\r\n57 Minutes. And in the most refrangible Rays the Sines I and R are 109\r\nand 81, and thence by Computation the greatest Angle AXR will be found\r\n40 Degrees and 17 Minutes, and the least Angle AYS 54 Degrees and 7\r\nMinutes.\r\n\r\nSuppose now that O [in _Fig._ 15.] is the Spectator's Eye, and OP a Line\r\ndrawn parallel to the Sun's Rays and let POE, POF, POG, POH, be Angles\r\nof 40 Degr. 17 Min. 42 Degr. 2 Min. 50 Degr. 57 Min. and 54 Degr. 7 Min.\r\nrespectively, and these Angles turned about their common Side OP, shall\r\nwith their other Sides OE, OF; OG, OH, describe the Verges of two\r\nRain-bows AF, BE and CHDG. For if E, F, G, H, be drops placed any where\r\nin the conical Superficies described by OE, OF, OG, OH, and be\r\nilluminated by the Sun's Rays SE, SF, SG, SH; the Angle SEO being equal\r\nto the Angle POE, or 40 Degr. 17 Min. shall be the greatest Angle in\r\nwhich the most refrangible Rays can after one Reflexion be refracted to\r\nthe Eye, and therefore all the Drops in the Line OE shall send the most\r\nrefrangible Rays most copiously to the Eye, and thereby strike the\r\nSenses with the deepest violet Colour in that Region. And in like\r\nmanner the Angle SFO being equal to the Angle POF, or 42 Degr. 2 Min.\r\nshall be the greatest in which the least refrangible Rays after one\r\nReflexion can emerge out of the Drops, and therefore those Rays shall\r\ncome most copiously to the Eye from the Drops in the Line OF, and strike\r\nthe Senses with the deepest red Colour in that Region. And by the same\r\nArgument, the Rays which have intermediate Degrees of Refrangibility\r\nshall come most copiously from Drops between E and F, and strike the\r\nSenses with the intermediate Colours, in the Order which their Degrees\r\nof Refrangibility require, that is in the Progress from E to F, or from\r\nthe inside of the Bow to the outside in this order, violet, indigo,\r\nblue, green, yellow, orange, red. But the violet, by the mixture of the\r\nwhite Light of the Clouds, will appear faint and incline to purple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the Angle SGO being equal to the Angle POG, or 50 Gr. 51 Min.\r\nshall be the least Angle in which the least refrangible Rays can after\r\ntwo Reflexions emerge out of the Drops, and therefore the least\r\nrefrangible Rays shall come most copiously to the Eye from the Drops in\r\nthe Line OG, and strike the Sense with the deepest red in that Region.\r\nAnd the Angle SHO being equal to the Angle POH, or 54 Gr. 7 Min. shall\r\nbe the least Angle, in which the most refrangible Rays after two\r\nReflexions can emerge out of the Drops; and therefore those Rays shall\r\ncome most copiously to the Eye from the Drops in the Line OH, and strike\r\nthe Senses with the deepest violet in that Region. And by the same\r\nArgument, the Drops in the Regions between G and H shall strike the\r\nSense with the intermediate Colours in the Order which their Degrees of\r\nRefrangibility require, that is, in the Progress from G to H, or from\r\nthe inside of the Bow to the outside in this order, red, orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, indigo, violet. And since these four Lines OE, OF, OG, OH,\r\nmay be situated any where in the above-mention'd conical Superficies;\r\nwhat is said of the Drops and Colours in these Lines is to be understood\r\nof the Drops and Colours every where in those Superficies.\r\n\r\nThus shall there be made two Bows of Colours, an interior and stronger,\r\nby one Reflexion in the Drops, and an exterior and fainter by two; for\r\nthe Light becomes fainter by every Reflexion. And their Colours shall\r\nlie in a contrary Order to one another, the red of both Bows bordering\r\nupon the Space GF, which is between the Bows. The Breadth of the\r\ninterior Bow EOF measured cross the Colours shall be 1 Degr. 45 Min. and\r\nthe Breadth of the exterior GOH shall be 3 Degr. 10 Min. and the\r\ndistance between them GOF shall be 8 Gr. 15 Min. the greatest\r\nSemi-diameter of the innermost, that is, the Angle POF being 42 Gr. 2\r\nMin. and the least Semi-diameter of the outermost POG, being 50 Gr. 57\r\nMin. These are the Measures of the Bows, as they would be were the Sun\r\nbut a Point; for by the Breadth of his Body, the Breadth of the Bows\r\nwill be increased, and their Distance decreased by half a Degree, and so\r\nthe breadth of the interior Iris will be 2 Degr. 15 Min. that of the\r\nexterior 3 Degr. 40 Min. their distance 8 Degr. 25 Min. the greatest\r\nSemi-diameter of the interior Bow 42 Degr. 17 Min. and the least of the\r\nexterior 50 Degr. 42 Min. And such are the Dimensions of the Bows in the\r\nHeavens found to be very nearly, when their Colours appear strong and\r\nperfect. For once, by such means as I then had, I measured the greatest\r\nSemi-diameter of the interior Iris about 42 Degrees, and the breadth of\r\nthe red, yellow and green in that Iris 63 or 64 Minutes, besides the\r\noutmost faint red obscured by the brightness of the Clouds, for which we\r\nmay allow 3 or 4 Minutes more. The breadth of the blue was about 40\r\nMinutes more besides the violet, which was so much obscured by the\r\nbrightness of the Clouds, that I could not measure its breadth. But\r\nsupposing the breadth of the blue and violet together to equal that of\r\nthe red, yellow and green together, the whole breadth of this Iris will\r\nbe about 2-1/4 Degrees, as above. The least distance between this Iris\r\nand the exterior Iris was about 8 Degrees and 30 Minutes. The exterior\r\nIris was broader than the interior, but so faint, especially on the blue\r\nside, that I could not measure its breadth distinctly. At another time\r\nwhen both Bows appeared more distinct, I measured the breadth of the\r\ninterior Iris 2 Gr. 10', and the breadth of the red, yellow and green in\r\nthe exterior Iris, was to the breadth of the same Colours in the\r\ninterior as 3 to 2.\r\n\r\nThis Explication of the Rain-bow is yet farther confirmed by the known\r\nExperiment (made by _Antonius de Dominis_ and _Des-Cartes_) of hanging\r\nup any where in the Sun-shine a Glass Globe filled with Water, and\r\nviewing it in such a posture, that the Rays which come from the Globe to\r\nthe Eye may contain with the Sun's Rays an Angle of either 42 or 50\r\nDegrees. For if the Angle be about 42 or 43 Degrees, the Spectator\r\n(suppose at O) shall see a full red Colour in that side of the Globe\r\nopposed to the Sun as 'tis represented at F, and if that Angle become\r\nless (suppose by depressing the Globe to E) there will appear other\r\nColours, yellow, green and blue successive in the same side of the\r\nGlobe. But if the Angle be made about 50 Degrees (suppose by lifting up\r\nthe Globe to G) there will appear a red Colour in that side of the Globe\r\ntowards the Sun, and if the Angle be made greater (suppose by lifting\r\nup the Globe to H) the red will turn successively to the other Colours,\r\nyellow, green and blue. The same thing I have tried, by letting a Globe\r\nrest, and raising or depressing the Eye, or otherwise moving it to make\r\nthe Angle of a just magnitude.\r\n\r\nI have heard it represented, that if the Light of a Candle be refracted\r\nby a Prism to the Eye; when the blue Colour falls upon the Eye, the\r\nSpectator shall see red in the Prism, and when the red falls upon the\r\nEye he shall see blue; and if this were certain, the Colours of the\r\nGlobe and Rain-bow ought to appear in a contrary order to what we find.\r\nBut the Colours of the Candle being very faint, the mistake seems to\r\narise from the difficulty of discerning what Colours fall on the Eye.\r\nFor, on the contrary, I have sometimes had occasion to observe in the\r\nSun's Light refracted by a Prism, that the Spectator always sees that\r\nColour in the Prism which falls upon his Eye. And the same I have found\r\ntrue also in Candle-light. For when the Prism is moved slowly from the\r\nLine which is drawn directly from the Candle to the Eye, the red appears\r\nfirst in the Prism and then the blue, and therefore each of them is seen\r\nwhen it falls upon the Eye. For the red passes over the Eye first, and\r\nthen the blue.\r\n\r\nThe Light which comes through drops of Rain by two Refractions without\r\nany Reflexion, ought to appear strongest at the distance of about 26\r\nDegrees from the Sun, and to decay gradually both ways as the distance\r\nfrom him increases and decreases. And the same is to be understood of\r\nLight transmitted through spherical Hail-stones. And if the Hail be a\r\nlittle flatted, as it often is, the Light transmitted may grow so strong\r\nat a little less distance than that of 26 Degrees, as to form a Halo\r\nabout the Sun or Moon; which Halo, as often as the Hail-stones are duly\r\nfigured may be colour'd, and then it must be red within by the least\r\nrefrangible Rays, and blue without by the most refrangible ones,\r\nespecially if the Hail-stones have opake Globules of Snow in their\r\ncenter to intercept the Light within the Halo (as _Hugenius_ has\r\nobserv'd) and make the inside thereof more distinctly defined than it\r\nwould otherwise be. For such Hail-stones, though spherical, by\r\nterminating the Light by the Snow, may make a Halo red within and\r\ncolourless without, and darker in the red than without, as Halos used to\r\nbe. For of those Rays which pass close by the Snow the Rubriform will be\r\nleast refracted, and so come to the Eye in the directest Lines.\r\n\r\nThe Light which passes through a drop of Rain after two Refractions, and\r\nthree or more Reflexions, is scarce strong enough to cause a sensible\r\nBow; but in those Cylinders of Ice by which _Hugenius_ explains the\r\n_Parhelia_, it may perhaps be sensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ X. PROB. V.\r\n\r\n_By the discovered Properties of Light to explain the permanent Colours\r\nof Natural Bodies._\r\n\r\nThese Colours arise from hence, that some natural Bodies reflect some\r\nsorts of Rays, others other sorts more copiously than the rest. Minium\r\nreflects the least refrangible or red-making Rays most copiously, and\r\nthence appears red. Violets reflect the most refrangible most copiously,\r\nand thence have their Colour, and so of other Bodies. Every Body\r\nreflects the Rays of its own Colour more copiously than the rest, and\r\nfrom their excess and predominance in the reflected Light has its\r\nColour.\r\n\r\n_Exper._ 17. For if in the homogeneal Lights obtained by the solution of\r\nthe Problem proposed in the fourth Proposition of the first Part of this\r\nBook, you place Bodies of several Colours, you will find, as I have\r\ndone, that every Body looks most splendid and luminous in the Light of\r\nits own Colour. Cinnaber in the homogeneal red Light is most\r\nresplendent, in the green Light it is manifestly less resplendent, and\r\nin the blue Light still less. Indigo in the violet blue Light is most\r\nresplendent, and its splendor is gradually diminish'd, as it is removed\r\nthence by degrees through the green and yellow Light to the red. By a\r\nLeek the green Light, and next that the blue and yellow which compound\r\ngreen, are more strongly reflected than the other Colours red and\r\nviolet, and so of the rest. But to make these Experiments the more\r\nmanifest, such Bodies ought to be chosen as have the fullest and most\r\nvivid Colours, and two of those Bodies are to be compared together.\r\nThus, for instance, if Cinnaber and _ultra_-marine blue, or some other\r\nfull blue be held together in the red homogeneal Light, they will both\r\nappear red, but the Cinnaber will appear of a strongly luminous and\r\nresplendent red, and the _ultra_-marine blue of a faint obscure and dark\r\nred; and if they be held together in the blue homogeneal Light, they\r\nwill both appear blue, but the _ultra_-marine will appear of a strongly\r\nluminous and resplendent blue, and the Cinnaber of a faint and dark\r\nblue. Which puts it out of dispute that the Cinnaber reflects the red\r\nLight much more copiously than the _ultra_-marine doth, and the\r\n_ultra_-marine reflects the blue Light much more copiously than the\r\nCinnaber doth. The same Experiment may be tried successfully with red\r\nLead and Indigo, or with any other two colour'd Bodies, if due allowance\r\nbe made for the different strength or weakness of their Colour and\r\nLight.\r\n\r\nAnd as the reason of the Colours of natural Bodies is evident by these\r\nExperiments, so it is farther confirmed and put past dispute by the two\r\nfirst Experiments of the first Part, whereby 'twas proved in such Bodies\r\nthat the reflected Lights which differ in Colours do differ also in\r\ndegrees of Refrangibility. For thence it's certain, that some Bodies\r\nreflect the more refrangible, others the less refrangible Rays more\r\ncopiously.\r\n\r\nAnd that this is not only a true reason of these Colours, but even the\r\nonly reason, may appear farther from this Consideration, that the Colour\r\nof homogeneal Light cannot be changed by the Reflexion of natural\r\nBodies.\r\n\r\nFor if Bodies by Reflexion cannot in the least change the Colour of any\r\none sort of Rays, they cannot appear colour'd by any other means than by\r\nreflecting those which either are of their own Colour, or which by\r\nmixture must produce it.\r\n\r\nBut in trying Experiments of this kind care must be had that the Light\r\nbe sufficiently homogeneal. For if Bodies be illuminated by the ordinary\r\nprismatick Colours, they will appear neither of their own Day-light\r\nColours, nor of the Colour of the Light cast on them, but of some middle\r\nColour between both, as I have found by Experience. Thus red Lead (for\r\ninstance) illuminated with the ordinary prismatick green will not appear\r\neither red or green, but orange or yellow, or between yellow and green,\r\naccordingly as the green Light by which 'tis illuminated is more or less\r\ncompounded. For because red Lead appears red when illuminated with white\r\nLight, wherein all sorts of Rays are equally mix'd, and in the green\r\nLight all sorts of Rays are not equally mix'd, the Excess of the\r\nyellow-making, green-making and blue-making Rays in the incident green\r\nLight, will cause those Rays to abound so much in the reflected Light,\r\nas to draw the Colour from red towards their Colour. And because the red\r\nLead reflects the red-making Rays most copiously in proportion to their\r\nnumber, and next after them the orange-making and yellow-making Rays;\r\nthese Rays in the reflected Light will be more in proportion to the\r\nLight than they were in the incident green Light, and thereby will draw\r\nthe reflected Light from green towards their Colour. And therefore the\r\nred Lead will appear neither red nor green, but of a Colour between\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nIn transparently colour'd Liquors 'tis observable, that their Colour\r\nuses to vary with their thickness. Thus, for instance, a red Liquor in a\r\nconical Glass held between the Light and the Eye, looks of a pale and\r\ndilute yellow at the bottom where 'tis thin, and a little higher where\r\n'tis thicker grows orange, and where 'tis still thicker becomes red, and\r\nwhere 'tis thickest the red is deepest and darkest. For it is to be\r\nconceiv'd that such a Liquor stops the indigo-making and violet-making\r\nRays most easily, the blue-making Rays more difficultly, the\r\ngreen-making Rays still more difficultly, and the red-making most\r\ndifficultly: And that if the thickness of the Liquor be only so much as\r\nsuffices to stop a competent number of the violet-making and\r\nindigo-making Rays, without diminishing much the number of the rest, the\r\nrest must (by _Prop._ 6. _Part_ 2.) compound a pale yellow. But if the\r\nLiquor be so much thicker as to stop also a great number of the\r\nblue-making Rays, and some of the green-making, the rest must compound\r\nan orange; and where it is so thick as to stop also a great number of\r\nthe green-making and a considerable number of the yellow-making, the\r\nrest must begin to compound a red, and this red must grow deeper and\r\ndarker as the yellow-making and orange-making Rays are more and more\r\nstopp'd by increasing the thickness of the Liquor, so that few Rays\r\nbesides the red-making can get through.\r\n\r\nOf this kind is an Experiment lately related to me by Mr. _Halley_, who,\r\nin diving deep into the Sea in a diving Vessel, found in a clear\r\nSun-shine Day, that when he was sunk many Fathoms deep into the Water\r\nthe upper part of his Hand on which the Sun shone directly through the\r\nWater and through a small Glass Window in the Vessel appeared of a red\r\nColour, like that of a Damask Rose, and the Water below and the under\r\npart of his Hand illuminated by Light reflected from the Water below\r\nlook'd green. For thence it may be gather'd, that the Sea-Water reflects\r\nback the violet and blue-making Rays most easily, and lets the\r\nred-making Rays pass most freely and copiously to great Depths. For\r\nthereby the Sun's direct Light at all great Depths, by reason of the\r\npredominating red-making Rays, must appear red; and the greater the\r\nDepth is, the fuller and intenser must that red be. And at such Depths\r\nas the violet-making Rays scarce penetrate unto, the blue-making,\r\ngreen-making, and yellow-making Rays being reflected from below more\r\ncopiously than the red-making ones, must compound a green.\r\n\r\nNow, if there be two Liquors of full Colours, suppose a red and blue,\r\nand both of them so thick as suffices to make their Colours sufficiently\r\nfull; though either Liquor be sufficiently transparent apart, yet will\r\nyou not be able to see through both together. For, if only the\r\nred-making Rays pass through one Liquor, and only the blue-making\r\nthrough the other, no Rays can pass through both. This Mr. _Hook_ tried\r\ncasually with Glass Wedges filled with red and blue Liquors, and was\r\nsurprized at the unexpected Event, the reason of it being then unknown;\r\nwhich makes me trust the more to his Experiment, though I have not tried\r\nit my self. But he that would repeat it, must take care the Liquors be\r\nof very good and full Colours.\r\n\r\nNow, whilst Bodies become coloured by reflecting or transmitting this or\r\nthat sort of Rays more copiously than the rest, it is to be conceived\r\nthat they stop and stifle in themselves the Rays which they do not\r\nreflect or transmit. For, if Gold be foliated and held between your Eye\r\nand the Light, the Light looks of a greenish blue, and therefore massy\r\nGold lets into its Body the blue-making Rays to be reflected to and fro\r\nwithin it till they be stopp'd and stifled, whilst it reflects the\r\nyellow-making outwards, and thereby looks yellow. And much after the\r\nsame manner that Leaf Gold is yellow by reflected, and blue by\r\ntransmitted Light, and massy Gold is yellow in all Positions of the Eye;\r\nthere are some Liquors, as the Tincture of _Lignum Nephriticum_, and\r\nsome sorts of Glass which transmit one sort of Light most copiously, and\r\nreflect another sort, and thereby look of several Colours, according to\r\nthe Position of the Eye to the Light. But, if these Liquors or Glasses\r\nwere so thick and massy that no Light could get through them, I question\r\nnot but they would like all other opake Bodies appear of one and the\r\nsame Colour in all Positions of the Eye, though this I cannot yet affirm\r\nby Experience. For all colour'd Bodies, so far as my Observation\r\nreaches, may be seen through if made sufficiently thin, and therefore\r\nare in some measure transparent, and differ only in degrees of\r\nTransparency from tinged transparent Liquors; these Liquors, as well as\r\nthose Bodies, by a sufficient Thickness becoming opake. A transparent\r\nBody which looks of any Colour by transmitted Light, may also look of\r\nthe same Colour by reflected Light, the Light of that Colour being\r\nreflected by the farther Surface of the Body, or by the Air beyond it.\r\nAnd then the reflected Colour will be diminished, and perhaps cease, by\r\nmaking the Body very thick, and pitching it on the backside to diminish\r\nthe Reflexion of its farther Surface, so that the Light reflected from\r\nthe tinging Particles may predominate. In such Cases, the Colour of the\r\nreflected Light will be apt to vary from that of the Light transmitted.\r\nBut whence it is that tinged Bodies and Liquors reflect some sort of\r\nRays, and intromit or transmit other sorts, shall be said in the next\r\nBook. In this Proposition I content my self to have put it past dispute,\r\nthat Bodies have such Properties, and thence appear colour'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP._ XI. PROB. VI.\r\n\r\n_By mixing colour'd Lights to compound a beam of Light of the same\r\nColour and Nature with a beam of the Sun's direct Light, and therein to\r\nexperience the Truth of the foregoing Propositions._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nLet ABC _abc_ [in _Fig._ 16.] represent a Prism, by which the Sun's\r\nLight let into a dark Chamber through the Hole F, may be refracted\r\ntowards the Lens MN, and paint upon it at _p_, _q_, _r_, _s_, and _t_,\r\nthe usual Colours violet, blue, green, yellow, and red, and let the\r\ndiverging Rays by the Refraction of this Lens converge again towards X,\r\nand there, by the mixture of all those their Colours, compound a white\r\naccording to what was shewn above. Then let another Prism DEG _deg_,\r\nparallel to the former, be placed at X, to refract that white Light\r\nupwards towards Y. Let the refracting Angles of the Prisms, and their\r\ndistances from the Lens be equal, so that the Rays which converged from\r\nthe Lens towards X, and without Refraction, would there have crossed and\r\ndiverged again, may by the Refraction of the second Prism be reduced\r\ninto Parallelism and diverge no more. For then those Rays will recompose\r\na beam of white Light XY. If the refracting Angle of either Prism be the\r\nbigger, that Prism must be so much the nearer to the Lens. You will know\r\nwhen the Prisms and the Lens are well set together, by observing if the\r\nbeam of Light XY, which comes out of the second Prism be perfectly white\r\nto the very edges of the Light, and at all distances from the Prism\r\ncontinue perfectly and totally white like a beam of the Sun's Light. For\r\ntill this happens, the Position of the Prisms and Lens to one another\r\nmust be corrected; and then if by the help of a long beam of Wood, as is\r\nrepresented in the Figure, or by a Tube, or some other such Instrument,\r\nmade for that Purpose, they be made fast in that Situation, you may try\r\nall the same Experiments in this compounded beam of Light XY, which have\r\nbeen made in the Sun's direct Light. For this compounded beam of Light\r\nhas the same appearance, and is endow'd with all the same Properties\r\nwith a direct beam of the Sun's Light, so far as my Observation reaches.\r\nAnd in trying Experiments in this beam you may by stopping any of the\r\nColours, _p_, _q_, _r_, _s_, and _t_, at the Lens, see how the Colours\r\nproduced in the Experiments are no other than those which the Rays had\r\nat the Lens before they entered the Composition of this Beam: And by\r\nconsequence, that they arise not from any new Modifications of the Light\r\nby Refractions and Reflexions, but from the various Separations and\r\nMixtures of the Rays originally endow'd with their colour-making\r\nQualities.\r\n\r\nSo, for instance, having with a Lens 4-1/4 Inches broad, and two Prisms\r\non either hand 6-1/4 Feet distant from the Lens, made such a beam of\r\ncompounded Light; to examine the reason of the Colours made by Prisms, I\r\nrefracted this compounded beam of Light XY with another Prism HIK _kh_,\r\nand thereby cast the usual Prismatick Colours PQRST upon the Paper LV\r\nplaced behind. And then by stopping any of the Colours _p_, _q_, _r_,\r\n_s_, _t_, at the Lens, I found that the same Colour would vanish at the\r\nPaper. So if the Purple _p_ was stopp'd at the Lens, the Purple P upon\r\nthe Paper would vanish, and the rest of the Colours would remain\r\nunalter'd, unless perhaps the blue, so far as some purple latent in it\r\nat the Lens might be separated from it by the following Refractions. And\r\nso by intercepting the green upon the Lens, the green R upon the Paper\r\nwould vanish, and so of the rest; which plainly shews, that as the white\r\nbeam of Light XY was compounded of several Lights variously colour'd at\r\nthe Lens, so the Colours which afterwards emerge out of it by new\r\nRefractions are no other than those of which its Whiteness was\r\ncompounded. The Refraction of the Prism HIK _kh_ generates the Colours\r\nPQRST upon the Paper, not by changing the colorific Qualities of the\r\nRays, but by separating the Rays which had the very same colorific\r\nQualities before they enter'd the Composition of the refracted beam of\r\nwhite Light XY. For otherwise the Rays which were of one Colour at the\r\nLens might be of another upon the Paper, contrary to what we find.\r\n\r\nSo again, to examine the reason of the Colours of natural Bodies, I\r\nplaced such Bodies in the Beam of Light XY, and found that they all\r\nappeared there of those their own Colours which they have in Day-light,\r\nand that those Colours depend upon the Rays which had the same Colours\r\nat the Lens before they enter'd the Composition of that beam. Thus, for\r\ninstance, Cinnaber illuminated by this beam appears of the same red\r\nColour as in Day-light; and if at the Lens you intercept the\r\ngreen-making and blue-making Rays, its redness will become more full and\r\nlively: But if you there intercept the red-making Rays, it will not any\r\nlonger appear red, but become yellow or green, or of some other Colour,\r\naccording to the sorts of Rays which you do not intercept. So Gold in\r\nthis Light XY appears of the same yellow Colour as in Day-light, but by\r\nintercepting at the Lens a due Quantity of the yellow-making Rays it\r\nwill appear white like Silver (as I have tried) which shews that its\r\nyellowness arises from the Excess of the intercepted Rays tinging that\r\nWhiteness with their Colour when they are let pass. So the Infusion of\r\n_Lignum Nephriticum_ (as I have also tried) when held in this beam of\r\nLight XY, looks blue by the reflected Part of the Light, and red by the\r\ntransmitted Part of it, as when 'tis view'd in Day-light; but if you\r\nintercept the blue at the Lens the Infusion will lose its reflected blue\r\nColour, whilst its transmitted red remains perfect, and by the loss of\r\nsome blue-making Rays, wherewith it was allay'd, becomes more intense\r\nand full. And, on the contrary, if the red and orange-making Rays be\r\nintercepted at the Lens, the Infusion will lose its transmitted red,\r\nwhilst its blue will remain and become more full and perfect. Which\r\nshews, that the Infusion does not tinge the Rays with blue and red, but\r\nonly transmits those most copiously which were red-making before, and\r\nreflects those most copiously which were blue-making before. And after\r\nthe same manner may the Reasons of other Phaenomena be examined, by\r\ntrying them in this artificial beam of Light XY.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] See p. 59.\r\n\r\n[J] _See our_ Author's Lect.

In the former Book I forbore to treat of these\r\nColours, because they seemed of a more difficult Consideration, and were\r\nnot necessary for establishing the Properties of Light there discoursed\r\nof. But because they may conduce to farther Discoveries for compleating\r\nthe Theory of Light, especially as to the constitution of the parts of\r\nnatural Bodies, on which their Colours or Transparency depend; I have\r\nhere set down an account of them. To render this Discourse short and\r\ndistinct, I have first described the principal of my Observations, and\r\nthen consider'd and made use of them. The Observations are these.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 1. Compressing two Prisms hard together that their sides (which\r\nby chance were a very little convex) might somewhere touch one another:\r\nI found the place in which they touched to become absolutely\r\ntransparent, as if they had there been one continued piece of Glass. For\r\nwhen the Light fell so obliquely on the Air, which in other places was\r\nbetween them, as to be all reflected; it seemed in that place of contact\r\nto be wholly transmitted, insomuch that when look'd upon, it appeared\r\nlike a black or dark spot, by reason that little or no sensible Light\r\nwas reflected from thence, as from other places; and when looked through\r\nit seemed (as it were) a hole in that Air which was formed into a thin\r\nPlate, by being compress'd between the Glasses. And through this hole\r\nObjects that were beyond might be seen distinctly, which could not at\r\nall be seen through other parts of the Glasses where the Air was\r\ninterjacent. Although the Glasses were a little convex, yet this\r\ntransparent spot was of a considerable breadth, which breadth seemed\r\nprincipally to proceed from the yielding inwards of the parts of the\r\nGlasses, by reason of their mutual pressure. For by pressing them very\r\nhard together it would become much broader than otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 2. When the Plate of Air, by turning the Prisms about their\r\ncommon Axis, became so little inclined to the incident Rays, that some\r\nof them began to be transmitted, there arose in it many slender Arcs of\r\nColours which at first were shaped almost like the Conchoid, as you see\r\nthem delineated in the first Figure. And by continuing the Motion of the\r\nPrisms, these Arcs increased and bended more and more about the said\r\ntransparent spot, till they were compleated into Circles or Rings\r\nincompassing it, and afterwards continually grew more and more\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThese Arcs at their first appearance were of a violet and blue Colour,\r\nand between them were white Arcs of Circles, which presently by\r\ncontinuing the Motion of the Prisms became a little tinged in their\r\ninward Limbs with red and yellow, and to their outward Limbs the blue\r\nwas adjacent. So that the order of these Colours from the central dark\r\nspot, was at that time white, blue, violet; black, red, orange, yellow,\r\nwhite, blue, violet, &c. But the yellow and red were much fainter than\r\nthe blue and violet.\r\n\r\nThe Motion of the Prisms about their Axis being continued, these Colours\r\ncontracted more and more, shrinking towards the whiteness on either\r\nside of it, until they totally vanished into it. And then the Circles in\r\nthose parts appear'd black and white, without any other Colours\r\nintermix'd. But by farther moving the Prisms about, the Colours again\r\nemerged out of the whiteness, the violet and blue at its inward Limb,\r\nand at its outward Limb the red and yellow. So that now their order from\r\nthe central Spot was white, yellow, red; black; violet, blue, white,\r\nyellow, red, &c. contrary to what it was before.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 3. When the Rings or some parts of them appeared only black and\r\nwhite, they were very distinct and well defined, and the blackness\r\nseemed as intense as that of the central Spot. Also in the Borders of\r\nthe Rings, where the Colours began to emerge out of the whiteness, they\r\nwere pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great multitude.\r\nI have sometimes number'd above thirty Successions (reckoning every\r\nblack and white Ring for one Succession) and seen more of them, which by\r\nreason of their smalness I could not number. But in other Positions of\r\nthe Prisms, at which the Rings appeared of many Colours, I could not\r\ndistinguish above eight or nine of them, and the Exterior of those were\r\nvery confused and dilute.\r\n\r\nIn these two Observations to see the Rings distinct, and without any\r\nother Colour than Black and white, I found it necessary to hold my Eye\r\nat a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the\r\nsame inclination of my Eye to the Plane of the Rings, there emerged a\r\nbluish Colour out of the white, which by dilating it self more and more\r\ninto the black, render'd the Circles less distinct, and left the white a\r\nlittle tinged with red and yellow. I found also by looking through a\r\nslit or oblong hole, which was narrower than the pupil of my Eye, and\r\nheld close to it parallel to the Prisms, I could see the Circles much\r\ndistincter and visible to a far greater number than otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 4. To observe more nicely the order of the Colours which arose\r\nout of the white Circles as the Rays became less and less inclined to\r\nthe Plate of Air; I took two Object-glasses, the one a Plano-convex for\r\na fourteen Foot Telescope, and the other a large double Convex for one\r\nof about fifty Foot; and upon this, laying the other with its plane side\r\ndownwards, I pressed them slowly together, to make the Colours\r\nsuccessively emerge in the middle of the Circles, and then slowly lifted\r\nthe upper Glass from the lower to make them successively vanish again in\r\nthe same place. The Colour, which by pressing the Glasses together,\r\nemerged last in the middle of the other Colours, would upon its first\r\nappearance look like a Circle of a Colour almost uniform from the\r\ncircumference to the center and by compressing the Glasses still more,\r\ngrow continually broader until a new Colour emerged in its center, and\r\nthereby it became a Ring encompassing that new Colour. And by\r\ncompressing the Glasses still more, the diameter of this Ring would\r\nincrease, and the breadth of its Orbit or Perimeter decrease until\r\nanother new Colour emerged in the center of the last: And so on until a\r\nthird, a fourth, a fifth, and other following new Colours successively\r\nemerged there, and became Rings encompassing the innermost Colour, the\r\nlast of which was the black Spot. And, on the contrary, by lifting up\r\nthe upper Glass from the lower, the diameter of the Rings would\r\ndecrease, and the breadth of their Orbit increase, until their Colours\r\nreached successively to the center; and then they being of a\r\nconsiderable breadth, I could more easily discern and distinguish their\r\nSpecies than before. And by this means I observ'd their Succession and\r\nQuantity to be as followeth.\r\n\r\nNext to the pellucid central Spot made by the contact of the Glasses\r\nsucceeded blue, white, yellow, and red. The blue was so little in\r\nquantity, that I could not discern it in the Circles made by the Prisms,\r\nnor could I well distinguish any violet in it, but the yellow and red\r\nwere pretty copious, and seemed about as much in extent as the white,\r\nand four or five times more than the blue. The next Circuit in order of\r\nColours immediately encompassing these were violet, blue, green, yellow,\r\nand red: and these were all of them copious and vivid, excepting the\r\ngreen, which was very little in quantity, and seemed much more faint and\r\ndilute than the other Colours. Of the other four, the violet was the\r\nleast in extent, and the blue less than the yellow or red. The third\r\nCircuit or Order was purple, blue, green, yellow, and red; in which the\r\npurple seemed more reddish than the violet in the former Circuit, and\r\nthe green was much more conspicuous, being as brisk and copious as any\r\nof the other Colours, except the yellow, but the red began to be a\r\nlittle faded, inclining very much to purple. After this succeeded the\r\nfourth Circuit of green and red. The green was very copious and lively,\r\ninclining on the one side to blue, and on the other side to yellow. But\r\nin this fourth Circuit there was neither violet, blue, nor yellow, and\r\nthe red was very imperfect and dirty. Also the succeeding Colours became\r\nmore and more imperfect and dilute, till after three or four revolutions\r\nthey ended in perfect whiteness. Their form, when the Glasses were most\r\ncompress'd so as to make the black Spot appear in the center, is\r\ndelineated in the second Figure; where _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_: _f_,\r\n_g_, _h_, _i_, _k_: _l_, _m_, _n_, _o_, _p_: _q_, _r_: _s_, _t_: _v_,\r\n_x_: _y_, _z_, denote the Colours reckon'd in order from the center,\r\nblack, blue, white, yellow, red: violet, blue, green, yellow, red:\r\npurple, blue, green, yellow, red: green, red: greenish blue, red:\r\ngreenish blue, pale red: greenish blue, reddish white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 5. To determine the interval of the Glasses, or thickness of the\r\ninterjacent Air, by which each Colour was produced, I measured the\r\nDiameters of the first six Rings at the most lucid part of their Orbits,\r\nand squaring them, I found their Squares to be in the arithmetical\r\nProgression of the odd Numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. And since one of\r\nthese Glasses was plane, and the other spherical, their Intervals at\r\nthose Rings must be in the same Progression. I measured also the\r\nDiameters of the dark or faint Rings between the more lucid Colours, and\r\nfound their Squares to be in the arithmetical Progression of the even\r\nNumbers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. And it being very nice and difficult to\r\ntake these measures exactly; I repeated them divers times at divers\r\nparts of the Glasses, that by their Agreement I might be confirmed in\r\nthem. And the same method I used in determining some others of the\r\nfollowing Observations.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 6. The Diameter of the sixth Ring at the most lucid part of its\r\nOrbit was 58/100 parts of an Inch, and the Diameter of the Sphere on\r\nwhich the double convex Object-glass was ground was about 102 Feet, and\r\nhence I gathered the thickness of the Air or Aereal Interval of the\r\nGlasses at that Ring. But some time after, suspecting that in making\r\nthis Observation I had not determined the Diameter of the Sphere with\r\nsufficient accurateness, and being uncertain whether the Plano-convex\r\nGlass was truly plane, and not something concave or convex on that side\r\nwhich I accounted plane; and whether I had not pressed the Glasses\r\ntogether, as I often did, to make them touch; (For by pressing such\r\nGlasses together their parts easily yield inwards, and the Rings thereby\r\nbecome sensibly broader than they would be, did the Glasses keep their\r\nFigures.) I repeated the Experiment, and found the Diameter of the sixth\r\nlucid Ring about 55/100 parts of an Inch. I repeated the Experiment also\r\nwith such an Object-glass of another Telescope as I had at hand. This\r\nwas a double Convex ground on both sides to one and the same Sphere, and\r\nits Focus was distant from it 83-2/5 Inches. And thence, if the Sines of\r\nIncidence and Refraction of the bright yellow Light be assumed in\r\nproportion as 11 to 17, the Diameter of the Sphere to which the Glass\r\nwas figured will by computation be found 182 Inches. This Glass I laid\r\nupon a flat one, so that the black Spot appeared in the middle of the\r\nRings of Colours without any other Pressure than that of the weight of\r\nthe Glass. And now measuring the Diameter of the fifth dark Circle as\r\naccurately as I could, I found it the fifth part of an Inch precisely.\r\nThis Measure was taken with the points of a pair of Compasses on the\r\nupper Surface on the upper Glass, and my Eye was about eight or nine\r\nInches distance from the Glass, almost perpendicularly over it, and the\r\nGlass was 1/6 of an Inch thick, and thence it is easy to collect that\r\nthe true Diameter of the Ring between the Glasses was greater than its\r\nmeasur'd Diameter above the Glasses in the Proportion of 80 to 79, or\r\nthereabouts, and by consequence equal to 16/79 parts of an Inch, and its\r\ntrue Semi-diameter equal to 8/79 parts. Now as the Diameter of the\r\nSphere (182 Inches) is to the Semi-diameter of this fifth dark Ring\r\n(8/79 parts of an Inch) so is this Semi-diameter to the thickness of the\r\nAir at this fifth dark Ring; which is therefore 32/567931 or\r\n100/1774784. Parts of an Inch; and the fifth Part thereof, _viz._ the\r\n1/88739 Part of an Inch, is the Thickness of the Air at the first of\r\nthese dark Rings.\r\n\r\nThe same Experiment I repeated with another double convex Object-glass\r\nground on both sides to one and the same Sphere. Its Focus was distant\r\nfrom it 168-1/2 Inches, and therefore the Diameter of that Sphere was\r\n184 Inches. This Glass being laid upon the same plain Glass, the\r\nDiameter of the fifth of the dark Rings, when the black Spot in their\r\nCenter appear'd plainly without pressing the Glasses, was by the measure\r\nof the Compasses upon the upper Glass 121/600 Parts of an Inch, and by\r\nconsequence between the Glasses it was 1222/6000: For the upper Glass\r\nwas 1/8 of an Inch thick, and my Eye was distant from it 8 Inches. And a\r\nthird proportional to half this from the Diameter of the Sphere is\r\n5/88850 Parts of an Inch. This is therefore the Thickness of the Air at\r\nthis Ring, and a fifth Part thereof, _viz._ the 1/88850th Part of an\r\nInch is the Thickness thereof at the first of the Rings, as above.\r\n\r\nI tried the same Thing, by laying these Object-glasses upon flat Pieces\r\nof a broken Looking-glass, and found the same Measures of the Rings:\r\nWhich makes me rely upon them till they can be determin'd more\r\naccurately by Glasses ground to larger Spheres, though in such Glasses\r\ngreater care must be taken of a true Plane.\r\n\r\nThese Dimensions were taken, when my Eye was placed almost\r\nperpendicularly over the Glasses, being about an Inch, or an Inch and a\r\nquarter, distant from the incident Rays, and eight Inches distant from\r\nthe Glass; so that the Rays were inclined to the Glass in an Angle of\r\nabout four Degrees. Whence by the following Observation you will\r\nunderstand, that had the Rays been perpendicular to the Glasses, the\r\nThickness of the Air at these Rings would have been less in the\r\nProportion of the Radius to the Secant of four Degrees, that is, of\r\n10000 to 10024. Let the Thicknesses found be therefore diminish'd in\r\nthis Proportion, and they will become 1/88952 and 1/89063, or (to use\r\nthe nearest round Number) the 1/89000th Part of an Inch. This is the\r\nThickness of the Air at the darkest Part of the first dark Ring made by\r\nperpendicular Rays; and half this Thickness multiplied by the\r\nProgression, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. gives the Thicknesses of the Air at\r\nthe most luminous Parts of all the brightest Rings, _viz._ 1/178000,\r\n3/178000, 5/178000, 7/178000, &c. their arithmetical Means 2/178000,\r\n4/178000, 6/178000, &c. being its Thicknesses at the darkest Parts of\r\nall the dark ones.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 7. The Rings were least, when my Eye was placed perpendicularly\r\nover the Glasses in the Axis of the Rings: And when I view'd them\r\nobliquely they became bigger, continually swelling as I removed my Eye\r\nfarther from the Axis. And partly by measuring the Diameter of the same\r\nCircle at several Obliquities of my Eye, partly by other Means, as also\r\nby making use of the two Prisms for very great Obliquities, I found its\r\nDiameter, and consequently the Thickness of the Air at its Perimeter in\r\nall those Obliquities to be very nearly in the Proportions express'd in\r\nthis Table.\r\n\r\n-------------------+--------------------+----------+----------\r\nAngle of Incidence |Angle of Refraction |Diameter  |Thickness\r\n        on         |         into       |  of the  |   of the\r\n      the Air.     |       the Air.     |   Ring.  |    Air.\r\n-------------------+--------------------+----------+----------\r\n    Deg.

In the third Column the Diameter of any\r\ncolour'd Ring at those Obliquities is expressed in Parts, of which ten\r\nconstitute that Diameter when the Rays are perpendicular. And in the\r\nfourth Column the Thickness of the Air at the Circumference of that Ring\r\nis expressed in Parts, of which also ten constitute its Thickness when\r\nthe Rays are perpendicular.\r\n\r\nAnd from these Measures I seem to gather this Rule: That the Thickness\r\nof the Air is proportional to the Secant of an Angle, whose Sine is a\r\ncertain mean Proportional between the Sines of Incidence and Refraction.\r\nAnd that mean Proportional, so far as by these Measures I can determine\r\nit, is the first of an hundred and six arithmetical mean Proportionals\r\nbetween those Sines counted from the bigger Sine, that is, from the Sine\r\nof Refraction when the Refraction is made out of the Glass into the\r\nPlate of Air, or from the Sine of Incidence when the Refraction is made\r\nout of the Plate of Air into the Glass.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 8. The dark Spot in the middle of the Rings increased also by the\r\nObliquation of the Eye, although almost insensibly. But, if instead of\r\nthe Object-glasses the Prisms were made use of, its Increase was more\r\nmanifest when viewed so obliquely that no Colours appear'd about it. It\r\nwas least when the Rays were incident most obliquely on the interjacent\r\nAir, and as the obliquity decreased it increased more and more until the\r\ncolour'd Rings appear'd, and then decreased again, but not so much as it\r\nincreased before. And hence it is evident, that the Transparency was\r\nnot only at the absolute Contact of the Glasses, but also where they had\r\nsome little Interval. I have sometimes observed the Diameter of that\r\nSpot to be between half and two fifth parts of the Diameter of the\r\nexterior Circumference of the red in the first Circuit or Revolution of\r\nColours when view'd almost perpendicularly; whereas when view'd\r\nobliquely it hath wholly vanish'd and become opake and white like the\r\nother parts of the Glass; whence it may be collected that the Glasses\r\ndid then scarcely, or not at all, touch one another, and that their\r\nInterval at the perimeter of that Spot when view'd perpendicularly was\r\nabout a fifth or sixth part of their Interval at the circumference of\r\nthe said red.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 9. By looking through the two contiguous Object-glasses, I found\r\nthat the interjacent Air exhibited Rings of Colours, as well by\r\ntransmitting Light as by reflecting it. The central Spot was now white,\r\nand from it the order of the Colours were yellowish red; black, violet,\r\nblue, white, yellow, red; violet, blue, green, yellow, red, &c. But\r\nthese Colours were very faint and dilute, unless when the Light was\r\ntrajected very obliquely through the Glasses: For by that means they\r\nbecame pretty vivid. Only the first yellowish red, like the blue in the\r\nfourth Observation, was so little and faint as scarcely to be discern'd.\r\nComparing the colour'd Rings made by Reflexion, with these made by\r\ntransmission of the Light; I found that white was opposite to black, red\r\nto blue, yellow to violet, and green to a Compound of red and violet.\r\nThat is, those parts of the Glass were black when looked through, which\r\nwhen looked upon appeared white, and on the contrary. And so those which\r\nin one case exhibited blue, did in the other case exhibit red. And the\r\nlike of the other Colours. The manner you have represented in the third\r\nFigure, where AB, CD, are the Surfaces of the Glasses contiguous at E,\r\nand the black Lines between them are their Distances in arithmetical\r\nProgression, and the Colours written above are seen by reflected Light,\r\nand those below by Light transmitted (p. 209).\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 10. Wetting the Object-glasses a little at their edges, the Water\r\ncrept in slowly between them, and the Circles thereby became less and\r\nthe Colours more faint: Insomuch that as the Water crept along, one half\r\nof them at which it first arrived would appear broken off from the other\r\nhalf, and contracted into a less Room. By measuring them I found the\r\nProportions of their Diameters to the Diameters of the like Circles made\r\nby Air to be about seven to eight, and consequently the Intervals of the\r\nGlasses at like Circles, caused by those two Mediums Water and Air, are\r\nas about three to four. Perhaps it may be a general Rule, That if any\r\nother Medium more or less dense than Water be compress'd between the\r\nGlasses, their Intervals at the Rings caused thereby will be to their\r\nIntervals caused by interjacent Air, as the Sines are which measure the\r\nRefraction made out of that Medium into Air.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 11. When the Water was between the Glasses, if I pressed the\r\nupper Glass variously at its edges to make the Rings move nimbly from\r\none place to another, a little white Spot would immediately follow the\r\ncenter of them, which upon creeping in of the ambient Water into that\r\nplace would presently vanish. Its appearance was such as interjacent Air\r\nwould have caused, and it exhibited the same Colours. But it was not\r\nair, for where any Bubbles of Air were in the Water they would not\r\nvanish. The Reflexion must have rather been caused by a subtiler Medium,\r\nwhich could recede through the Glasses at the creeping in of the Water.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 12. These Observations were made in the open Air. But farther to\r\nexamine the Effects of colour'd Light falling on the Glasses, I darken'd\r\nthe Room, and view'd them by Reflexion of the Colours of a Prism cast on\r\na Sheet of white Paper, my Eye being so placed that I could see the\r\ncolour'd Paper by Reflexion in the Glasses, as in a Looking-glass. And\r\nby this means the Rings became distincter and visible to a far greater\r\nnumber than in the open Air. I have sometimes seen more than twenty of\r\nthem, whereas in the open Air I could not discern above eight or nine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 13. Appointing an Assistant to move the Prism to and fro about\r\nits Axis, that all the Colours might successively fall on that part of\r\nthe Paper which I saw by Reflexion from that part of the Glasses, where\r\nthe Circles appear'd, so that all the Colours might be successively\r\nreflected from the Circles to my Eye, whilst I held it immovable, I\r\nfound the Circles which the red Light made to be manifestly bigger than\r\nthose which were made by the blue and violet. And it was very pleasant\r\nto see them gradually swell or contract accordingly as the Colour of the\r\nLight was changed. The Interval of the Glasses at any of the Rings when\r\nthey were made by the utmost red Light, was to their Interval at the\r\nsame Ring when made by the utmost violet, greater than as 3 to 2, and\r\nless than as 13 to 8. By the most of my Observations it was as 14 to 9.\r\nAnd this Proportion seem'd very nearly the same in all Obliquities of my\r\nEye; unless when two Prisms were made use of instead of the\r\nObject-glasses. For then at a certain great obliquity of my Eye, the\r\nRings made by the several Colours seem'd equal, and at a greater\r\nobliquity those made by the violet would be greater than the same Rings\r\nmade by the red: the Refraction of the Prism in this case causing the\r\nmost refrangible Rays to fall more obliquely on that plate of the Air\r\nthan the least refrangible ones. Thus the Experiment succeeded in the\r\ncolour'd Light, which was sufficiently strong and copious to make the\r\nRings sensible. And thence it may be gather'd, that if the most\r\nrefrangible and least refrangible Rays had been copious enough to make\r\nthe Rings sensible without the mixture of other Rays, the Proportion\r\nwhich here was 14 to 9 would have been a little greater, suppose 14-1/4\r\nor 14-1/3 to 9.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 14. Whilst the Prism was turn'd about its Axis with an uniform\r\nMotion, to make all the several Colours fall successively upon the\r\nObject-glasses, and thereby to make the Rings contract and dilate: The\r\nContraction or Dilatation of each Ring thus made by the variation of its\r\nColour was swiftest in the red, and slowest in the violet, and in the\r\nintermediate Colours it had intermediate degrees of Celerity. Comparing\r\nthe quantity of Contraction and Dilatation made by all the degrees of\r\neach Colour, I found that it was greatest in the red; less in the\r\nyellow, still less in the blue, and least in the violet. And to make as\r\njust an Estimation as I could of the Proportions of their Contractions\r\nor Dilatations, I observ'd that the whole Contraction or Dilatation of\r\nthe Diameter of any Ring made by all the degrees of red, was to that of\r\nthe Diameter of the same Ring made by all the degrees of violet, as\r\nabout four to three, or five to four, and that when the Light was of the\r\nmiddle Colour between yellow and green, the Diameter of the Ring was\r\nvery nearly an arithmetical Mean between the greatest Diameter of the\r\nsame Ring made by the outmost red, and the least Diameter thereof made\r\nby the outmost violet: Contrary to what happens in the Colours of the\r\noblong Spectrum made by the Refraction of a Prism, where the red is most\r\ncontracted, the violet most expanded, and in the midst of all the\r\nColours is the Confine of green and blue. And hence I seem to collect\r\nthat the thicknesses of the Air between the Glasses there, where the\r\nRing is successively made by the limits of the five principal Colours\r\n(red, yellow, green, blue, violet) in order (that is, by the extreme\r\nred, by the limit of red and yellow in the middle of the orange, by the\r\nlimit of yellow and green, by the limit of green and blue, by the limit\r\nof blue and violet in the middle of the indigo, and by the extreme\r\nviolet) are to one another very nearly as the sixth lengths of a Chord\r\nwhich found the Notes in a sixth Major, _sol_, _la_, _mi_, _fa_, _sol_,\r\n_la_. But it agrees something better with the Observation to say, that\r\nthe thicknesses of the Air between the Glasses there, where the Rings\r\nare successively made by the limits of the seven Colours, red, orange,\r\nyellow, green, blue, indigo, violet in order, are to one another as the\r\nCube Roots of the Squares of the eight lengths of a Chord, which found\r\nthe Notes in an eighth, _sol_, _la_, _fa_, _sol_, _la_, _mi_, _fa_,\r\n_sol_; that is, as the Cube Roots of the Squares of the Numbers, 1, 8/9,\r\n5/6, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5, 9/16, 1/2.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 15. These Rings were not of various Colours like those made in\r\nthe open Air, but appeared all over of that prismatick Colour only with\r\nwhich they were illuminated. And by projecting the prismatick Colours\r\nimmediately upon the Glasses, I found that the Light which fell on the\r\ndark Spaces which were between the Colour'd Rings was transmitted\r\nthrough the Glasses without any variation of Colour. For on a white\r\nPaper placed behind, it would paint Rings of the same Colour with those\r\nwhich were reflected, and of the bigness of their immediate Spaces. And\r\nfrom thence the origin of these Rings is manifest; namely, that the Air\r\nbetween the Glasses, according to its various thickness, is disposed in\r\nsome places to reflect, and in others to transmit the Light of any one\r\nColour (as you may see represented in the fourth Figure) and in the same\r\nplace to reflect that of one Colour where it transmits that of another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 16. The Squares of the Diameters of these Rings made by any\r\nprismatick Colour were in arithmetical Progression, as in the fifth\r\nObservation. And the Diameter of the sixth Circle, when made by the\r\ncitrine yellow, and viewed almost perpendicularly was about 58/100 parts\r\nof an Inch, or a little less, agreeable to the sixth Observation.\r\n\r\nThe precedent Observations were made with a rarer thin Medium,\r\nterminated by a denser, such as was Air or Water compress'd between two\r\nGlasses. In those that follow are set down the Appearances of a denser\r\nMedium thin'd within a rarer, such as are Plates of Muscovy Glass,\r\nBubbles of Water, and some other thin Substances terminated on all sides\r\nwith air.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 17. If a Bubble be blown with Water first made tenacious by\r\ndissolving a little Soap in it, 'tis a common Observation, that after a\r\nwhile it will appear tinged with a great variety of Colours. To defend\r\nthese Bubbles from being agitated by the external Air (whereby their\r\nColours are irregularly moved one among another, so that no accurate\r\nObservation can be made of them,) as soon as I had blown any of them I\r\ncover'd it with a clear Glass, and by that means its Colours emerged in\r\na very regular order, like so many concentrick Rings encompassing the\r\ntop of the Bubble. And as the Bubble grew thinner by the continual\r\nsubsiding of the Water, these Rings dilated slowly and overspread the\r\nwhole Bubble, descending in order to the bottom of it, where they\r\nvanish'd successively. In the mean while, after all the Colours were\r\nemerged at the top, there grew in the center of the Rings a small round\r\nblack Spot, like that in the first Observation, which continually\r\ndilated it self till it became sometimes more than 1/2 or 3/4 of an Inch\r\nin breadth before the Bubble broke. At first I thought there had been no\r\nLight reflected from the Water in that place, but observing it more\r\ncuriously, I saw within it several smaller round Spots, which appeared\r\nmuch blacker and darker than the rest, whereby I knew that there was\r\nsome Reflexion at the other places which were not so dark as those\r\nSpots. And by farther Tryal I found that I could see the Images of some\r\nthings (as of a Candle or the Sun) very faintly reflected, not only from\r\nthe great black Spot, but also from the little darker Spots which were\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\nBesides the aforesaid colour'd Rings there would often appear small\r\nSpots of Colours, ascending and descending up and down the sides of the\r\nBubble, by reason of some Inequalities in the subsiding of the Water.\r\nAnd sometimes small black Spots generated at the sides would ascend up\r\nto the larger black Spot at the top of the Bubble, and unite with it.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 18. Because the Colours of these Bubbles were more extended and\r\nlively than those of the Air thinn'd between two Glasses, and so more\r\neasy to be distinguish'd, I shall here give you a farther description of\r\ntheir order, as they were observ'd in viewing them by Reflexion of the\r\nSkies when of a white Colour, whilst a black substance was placed\r\nbehind the Bubble. And they were these, red, blue; red, blue; red, blue;\r\nred, green; red, yellow, green, blue, purple; red, yellow, green, blue,\r\nviolet; red, yellow, white, blue, black.\r\n\r\nThe three first Successions of red and blue were very dilute and dirty,\r\nespecially the first, where the red seem'd in a manner to be white.\r\nAmong these there was scarce any other Colour sensible besides red and\r\nblue, only the blues (and principally the second blue) inclined a little\r\nto green.\r\n\r\nThe fourth red was also dilute and dirty, but not so much as the former\r\nthree; after that succeeded little or no yellow, but a copious green,\r\nwhich at first inclined a little to yellow, and then became a pretty\r\nbrisk and good willow green, and afterwards changed to a bluish Colour;\r\nbut there succeeded neither blue nor violet.\r\n\r\nThe fifth red at first inclined very much to purple, and afterwards\r\nbecame more bright and brisk, but yet not very pure. This was succeeded\r\nwith a very bright and intense yellow, which was but little in quantity,\r\nand soon chang'd to green: But that green was copious and something more\r\npure, deep and lively, than the former green. After that follow'd an\r\nexcellent blue of a bright Sky-colour, and then a purple, which was less\r\nin quantity than the blue, and much inclined to red.\r\n\r\nThe sixth red was at first of a very fair and lively scarlet, and soon\r\nafter of a brighter Colour, being very pure and brisk, and the best of\r\nall the reds. Then after a lively orange follow'd an intense bright and\r\ncopious yellow, which was also the best of all the yellows, and this\r\nchanged first to a greenish yellow, and then to a greenish blue; but the\r\ngreen between the yellow and the blue, was very little and dilute,\r\nseeming rather a greenish white than a green. The blue which succeeded\r\nbecame very good, and of a very bright Sky-colour, but yet something\r\ninferior to the former blue; and the violet was intense and deep with\r\nlittle or no redness in it. And less in quantity than the blue.\r\n\r\nIn the last red appeared a tincture of scarlet next to violet, which\r\nsoon changed to a brighter Colour, inclining to an orange; and the\r\nyellow which follow'd was at first pretty good and lively, but\r\nafterwards it grew more dilute until by degrees it ended in perfect\r\nwhiteness. And this whiteness, if the Water was very tenacious and\r\nwell-temper'd, would slowly spread and dilate it self over the greater\r\npart of the Bubble; continually growing paler at the top, where at\r\nlength it would crack in many places, and those cracks, as they dilated,\r\nwould appear of a pretty good, but yet obscure and dark Sky-colour; the\r\nwhite between the blue Spots diminishing, until it resembled the Threds\r\nof an irregular Net-work, and soon after vanish'd, and left all the\r\nupper part of the Bubble of the said dark blue Colour. And this Colour,\r\nafter the aforesaid manner, dilated it self downwards, until sometimes\r\nit hath overspread the whole Bubble. In the mean while at the top, which\r\nwas of a darker blue than the bottom, and appear'd also full of many\r\nround blue Spots, something darker than the rest, there would emerge\r\none or more very black Spots, and within those, other Spots of an\r\nintenser blackness, which I mention'd in the former Observation; and\r\nthese continually dilated themselves until the Bubble broke.\r\n\r\nIf the Water was not very tenacious, the black Spots would break forth\r\nin the white, without any sensible intervention of the blue. And\r\nsometimes they would break forth within the precedent yellow, or red, or\r\nperhaps within the blue of the second order, before the intermediate\r\nColours had time to display themselves.\r\n\r\nBy this description you may perceive how great an affinity these Colours\r\nhave with those of Air described in the fourth Observation, although set\r\ndown in a contrary order, by reason that they begin to appear when the\r\nBubble is thickest, and are most conveniently reckon'd from the lowest\r\nand thickest part of the Bubble upwards.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 19. Viewing in several oblique Positions of my Eye the Rings of\r\nColours emerging on the top of the Bubble, I found that they were\r\nsensibly dilated by increasing the obliquity, but yet not so much by far\r\nas those made by thinn'd Air in the seventh Observation. For there they\r\nwere dilated so much as, when view'd most obliquely, to arrive at a part\r\nof the Plate more than twelve times thicker than that where they\r\nappear'd when viewed perpendicularly; whereas in this case the thickness\r\nof the Water, at which they arrived when viewed most obliquely, was to\r\nthat thickness which exhibited them by perpendicular Rays, something\r\nless than as 8 to 5. By the best of my Observations it was between 15\r\nand 15-1/2 to 10; an increase about 24 times less than in the other\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Bubble would become of an uniform thickness all over,\r\nexcept at the top of it near the black Spot, as I knew, because it would\r\nexhibit the same appearance of Colours in all Positions of the Eye. And\r\nthen the Colours which were seen at its apparent circumference by the\r\nobliquest Rays, would be different from those that were seen in other\r\nplaces, by Rays less oblique to it. And divers Spectators might see the\r\nsame part of it of differing Colours, by viewing it at very differing\r\nObliquities. Now observing how much the Colours at the same places of\r\nthe Bubble, or at divers places of equal thickness, were varied by the\r\nseveral Obliquities of the Rays; by the assistance of the 4th, 14th,\r\n16th and 18th Observations, as they are hereafter explain'd, I collect\r\nthe thickness of the Water requisite to exhibit any one and the same\r\nColour, at several Obliquities, to be very nearly in the Proportion\r\nexpressed in this Table.\r\n\r\n-----------------+------------------+----------------\r\n  Incidence on   | Refraction into  | Thickness of\r\n   the Water.    |    the Water.    |   the Water.\r\n-----------------+------------------+----------------\r\n   Deg.

Where I suppose, that the Sines which measure them are in\r\nround Numbers, as 3 to 4, though probably the Dissolution of Soap in the\r\nWater, may a little alter its refractive Virtue. In the third Column,\r\nthe Thickness of the Bubble, at which any one Colour is exhibited in\r\nthose several Obliquities, is express'd in Parts, of which ten\r\nconstitute its Thickness when the Rays are perpendicular. And the Rule\r\nfound by the seventh Observation agrees well with these Measures, if\r\nduly apply'd; namely, that the Thickness of a Plate of Water requisite\r\nto exhibit one and the same Colour at several Obliquities of the Eye, is\r\nproportional to the Secant of an Angle, whose Sine is the first of an\r\nhundred and six arithmetical mean Proportionals between the Sines of\r\nIncidence and Refraction counted from the lesser Sine, that is, from the\r\nSine of Refraction when the Refraction is made out of Air into Water,\r\notherwise from the Sine of Incidence.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes observ'd, that the Colours which arise on polish'd\r\nSteel by heating it, or on Bell-metal, and some other metalline\r\nSubstances, when melted and pour'd on the Ground, where they may cool in\r\nthe open Air, have, like the Colours of Water-bubbles, been a little\r\nchanged by viewing them at divers Obliquities, and particularly that a\r\ndeep blue, or violet, when view'd very obliquely, hath been changed to a\r\ndeep red. But the Changes of these Colours are not so great and\r\nsensible as of those made by Water. For the Scoria, or vitrified Part of\r\nthe Metal, which most Metals when heated or melted do continually\r\nprotrude, and send out to their Surface, and which by covering the\r\nMetals in form of a thin glassy Skin, causes these Colours, is much\r\ndenser than Water; and I find that the Change made by the Obliquation of\r\nthe Eye is least in Colours of the densest thin Substances.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 20. As in the ninth Observation, so here, the Bubble, by\r\ntransmitted Light, appear'd of a contrary Colour to that, which it\r\nexhibited by Reflexion. Thus when the Bubble being look'd on by the\r\nLight of the Clouds reflected from it, seemed red at its apparent\r\nCircumference, if the Clouds at the same time, or immediately after,\r\nwere view'd through it, the Colour at its Circumference would be blue.\r\nAnd, on the contrary, when by reflected Light it appeared blue, it would\r\nappear red by transmitted Light.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 21. By wetting very thin Plates of _Muscovy_ Glass, whose\r\nthinness made the like Colours appear, the Colours became more faint and\r\nlanguid, especially by wetting the Plates on that side opposite to the\r\nEye: But I could not perceive any variation of their Species. So then\r\nthe thickness of a Plate requisite to produce any Colour, depends only\r\non the density of the Plate, and not on that of the ambient Medium. And\r\nhence, by the 10th and 16th Observations, may be known the thickness\r\nwhich Bubbles of Water, or Plates of _Muscovy_ Glass, or other\r\nSubstances, have at any Colour produced by them.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 22. A thin transparent Body, which is denser than its ambient\r\nMedium, exhibits more brisk and vivid Colours than that which is so much\r\nrarer; as I have particularly observed in the Air and Glass. For blowing\r\nGlass very thin at a Lamp Furnace, those Plates encompassed with Air did\r\nexhibit Colours much more vivid than those of Air made thin between two\r\nGlasses.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 23. Comparing the quantity of Light reflected from the several\r\nRings, I found that it was most copious from the first or inmost, and in\r\nthe exterior Rings became gradually less and less. Also the whiteness of\r\nthe first Ring was stronger than that reflected from those parts of the\r\nthin Medium or Plate which were without the Rings; as I could manifestly\r\nperceive by viewing at a distance the Rings made by the two\r\nObject-glasses; or by comparing two Bubbles of Water blown at distant\r\nTimes, in the first of which the Whiteness appear'd, which succeeded all\r\nthe Colours, and in the other, the Whiteness which preceded them all.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 24. When the two Object-glasses were lay'd upon one another, so\r\nas to make the Rings of the Colours appear, though with my naked Eye I\r\ncould not discern above eight or nine of those Rings, yet by viewing\r\nthem through a Prism I have seen a far greater Multitude, insomuch that\r\nI could number more than forty, besides many others, that were so very\r\nsmall and close together, that I could not keep my Eye steady on them\r\nseverally so as to number them, but by their Extent I have sometimes\r\nestimated them to be more than an hundred. And I believe the Experiment\r\nmay be improved to the Discovery of far greater Numbers. For they seem\r\nto be really unlimited, though visible only so far as they can be\r\nseparated by the Refraction of the Prism, as I shall hereafter explain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nBut it was but one side of these Rings, namely, that towards which the\r\nRefraction was made, which by that Refraction was render'd distinct, and\r\nthe other side became more confused than when view'd by the naked Eye,\r\ninsomuch that there I could not discern above one or two, and sometimes\r\nnone of those Rings, of which I could discern eight or nine with my\r\nnaked Eye. And their Segments or Arcs, which on the other side appear'd\r\nso numerous, for the most part exceeded not the third Part of a Circle.\r\nIf the Refraction was very great, or the Prism very distant from the\r\nObject-glasses, the middle Part of those Arcs became also confused, so\r\nas to disappear and constitute an even Whiteness, whilst on either side\r\ntheir Ends, as also the whole Arcs farthest from the Center, became\r\ndistincter than before, appearing in the Form as you see them design'd\r\nin the fifth Figure.\r\n\r\nThe Arcs, where they seem'd distinctest, were only white and black\r\nsuccessively, without any other Colours intermix'd. But in other Places\r\nthere appeared Colours, whose Order was inverted by the refraction in\r\nsuch manner, that if I first held the Prism very near the\r\nObject-glasses, and then gradually removed it farther off towards my\r\nEye, the Colours of the 2d, 3d, 4th, and following Rings, shrunk towards\r\nthe white that emerged between them, until they wholly vanish'd into it\r\nat the middle of the Arcs, and afterwards emerged again in a contrary\r\nOrder. But at the Ends of the Arcs they retain'd their Order unchanged.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes so lay'd one Object-glass upon the other, that to the\r\nnaked Eye they have all over seem'd uniformly white, without the least\r\nAppearance of any of the colour'd Rings; and yet by viewing them through\r\na Prism, great Multitudes of those Rings have discover'd themselves. And\r\nin like manner Plates of _Muscovy_ Glass, and Bubbles of Glass blown at\r\na Lamp-Furnace, which were not so thin as to exhibit any Colours to the\r\nnaked Eye, have through the Prism exhibited a great Variety of them\r\nranged irregularly up and down in the Form of Waves. And so Bubbles of\r\nWater, before they began to exhibit their Colours to the naked Eye of a\r\nBystander, have appeared through a Prism, girded about with many\r\nparallel and horizontal Rings; to produce which Effect, it was necessary\r\nto hold the Prism parallel, or very nearly parallel to the Horizon, and\r\nto dispose it so that the Rays might be refracted upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nSECOND BOOK\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nOPTICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART II._\r\n\r\n_Remarks upon the foregoing Observations._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving given my Observations of these Colours, before I make use of them\r\nto unfold the Causes of the Colours of natural Bodies, it is convenient\r\nthat by the simplest of them, such as are the 2d, 3d, 4th, 9th, 12th,\r\n18th, 20th, and 24th, I first explain the more compounded. And first to\r\nshew how the Colours in the fourth and eighteenth Observations are\r\nproduced, let there be taken in any Right Line from the Point Y, [in\r\n_Fig._ 6.] the Lengths YA, YB, YC, YD, YE, YF, YG, YH, in proportion to\r\none another, as the Cube-Roots of the Squares of the Numbers, 1/2, 9/16,\r\n3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 8/9, 1, whereby the Lengths of a Musical Chord to\r\nsound all the Notes in an eighth are represented; that is, in the\r\nProportion of the Numbers 6300, 6814, 7114, 7631, 8255, 8855, 9243,\r\n10000. And at the Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, let Perpendiculars\r\nA[Greek: a], B[Greek: b], &c. be erected, by whose Intervals the Extent\r\nof the several Colours set underneath against them, is to be\r\nrepresented. Then divide the Line _A[Greek: a]_ in such Proportion as\r\nthe Numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, &c. set at the Points of\r\nDivision denote. And through those Divisions from Y draw Lines 1I, 2K,\r\n3L, 5M, 6N, 7O, &c.\r\n\r\nNow, if A2 be supposed to represent the Thickness of any thin\r\ntransparent Body, at which the outmost Violet is most copiously\r\nreflected in the first Ring, or Series of Colours, then by the 13th\r\nObservation, HK will represent its Thickness, at which the utmost Red is\r\nmost copiously reflected in the same Series. Also by the 5th and 16th\r\nObservations, A6 and HN will denote the Thicknesses at which those\r\nextreme Colours are most copiously reflected in the second Series, and\r\nA10 and HQ the Thicknesses at which they are most copiously reflected in\r\nthe third Series, and so on. And the Thickness at which any of the\r\nintermediate Colours are reflected most copiously, will, according to\r\nthe 14th Observation, be defined by the distance of the Line AH from the\r\nintermediate parts of the Lines 2K, 6N, 10Q, &c. against which the Names\r\nof those Colours are written below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nBut farther, to define the Latitude of these Colours in each Ring or\r\nSeries, let A1 design the least thickness, and A3 the greatest\r\nthickness, at which the extreme violet in the first Series is reflected,\r\nand let HI, and HL, design the like limits for the extreme red, and let\r\nthe intermediate Colours be limited by the intermediate parts of the\r\nLines 1I, and 3L, against which the Names of those Colours are written,\r\nand so on: But yet with this caution, that the Reflexions be supposed\r\nstrongest at the intermediate Spaces, 2K, 6N, 10Q, &c. and from thence\r\nto decrease gradually towards these limits, 1I, 3L, 5M, 7O, &c. on\r\neither side; where you must not conceive them to be precisely limited,\r\nbut to decay indefinitely. And whereas I have assign'd the same Latitude\r\nto every Series, I did it, because although the Colours in the first\r\nSeries seem to be a little broader than the rest, by reason of a\r\nstronger Reflexion there, yet that inequality is so insensible as\r\nscarcely to be determin'd by Observation.\r\n\r\nNow according to this Description, conceiving that the Rays originally\r\nof several Colours are by turns reflected at the Spaces 1I, L3, 5M, O7,\r\n9PR11, &c. and transmitted at the Spaces AHI1, 3LM5, 7OP9, &c. it is\r\neasy to know what Colour must in the open Air be exhibited at any\r\nthickness of a transparent thin Body. For if a Ruler be applied parallel\r\nto AH, at that distance from it by which the thickness of the Body is\r\nrepresented, the alternate Spaces 1IL3, 5MO7, &c. which it crosseth will\r\ndenote the reflected original Colours, of which the Colour exhibited in\r\nthe open Air is compounded. Thus if the constitution of the green in the\r\nthird Series of Colours be desired, apply the Ruler as you see at\r\n[Greek: prsph], and by its passing through some of the blue at [Greek:\r\np] and yellow at [Greek: s], as well as through the green at [Greek: r],\r\nyou may conclude that the green exhibited at that thickness of the Body\r\nis principally constituted of original green, but not without a mixture\r\nof some blue and yellow.\r\n\r\nBy this means you may know how the Colours from the center of the Rings\r\noutward ought to succeed in order as they were described in the 4th and\r\n18th Observations. For if you move the Ruler gradually from AH through\r\nall distances, having pass'd over the first Space which denotes little\r\nor no Reflexion to be made by thinnest Substances, it will first arrive\r\nat 1 the violet, and then very quickly at the blue and green, which\r\ntogether with that violet compound blue, and then at the yellow and red,\r\nby whose farther addition that blue is converted into whiteness, which\r\nwhiteness continues during the transit of the edge of the Ruler from I\r\nto 3, and after that by the successive deficience of its component\r\nColours, turns first to compound yellow, and then to red, and last of\r\nall the red ceaseth at L. Then begin the Colours of the second Series,\r\nwhich succeed in order during the transit of the edge of the Ruler from\r\n5 to O, and are more lively than before, because more expanded and\r\nsevered. And for the same reason instead of the former white there\r\nintercedes between the blue and yellow a mixture of orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue and indigo, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute and\r\nimperfect green. So the Colours of the third Series all succeed in\r\norder; first, the violet, which a little interferes with the red of the\r\nsecond order, and is thereby inclined to a reddish purple; then the blue\r\nand green, which are less mix'd with other Colours, and consequently\r\nmore lively than before, especially the green: Then follows the yellow,\r\nsome of which towards the green is distinct and good, but that part of\r\nit towards the succeeding red, as also that red is mix'd with the violet\r\nand blue of the fourth Series, whereby various degrees of red very much\r\ninclining to purple are compounded. This violet and blue, which should\r\nsucceed this red, being mixed with, and hidden in it, there succeeds a\r\ngreen. And this at first is much inclined to blue, but soon becomes a\r\ngood green, the only unmix'd and lively Colour in this fourth Series.\r\nFor as it verges towards the yellow, it begins to interfere with the\r\nColours of the fifth Series, by whose mixture the succeeding yellow and\r\nred are very much diluted and made dirty, especially the yellow, which\r\nbeing the weaker Colour is scarce able to shew it self. After this the\r\nseveral Series interfere more and more, and their Colours become more\r\nand more intermix'd, till after three or four more revolutions (in which\r\nthe red and blue predominate by turns) all sorts of Colours are in all\r\nplaces pretty equally blended, and compound an even whiteness.\r\n\r\nAnd since by the 15th Observation the Rays endued with one Colour are\r\ntransmitted, where those of another Colour are reflected, the reason of\r\nthe Colours made by the transmitted Light in the 9th and 20th\r\nObservations is from hence evident.\r\n\r\nIf not only the Order and Species of these Colours, but also the precise\r\nthickness of the Plate, or thin Body at which they are exhibited, be\r\ndesired in parts of an Inch, that may be also obtained by assistance of\r\nthe 6th or 16th Observations. For according to those Observations the\r\nthickness of the thinned Air, which between two Glasses exhibited the\r\nmost luminous parts of the first six Rings were 1/178000, 3/178000,\r\n5/178000, 7/178000, 9/178000, 11/178000 parts of an Inch. Suppose the\r\nLight reflected most copiously at these thicknesses be the bright\r\ncitrine yellow, or confine of yellow and orange, and these thicknesses\r\nwill be F[Greek: l], F[Greek: m], F[Greek: u], F[Greek: x], F[Greek: o],\r\nF[Greek: t]. And this being known, it is easy to determine what\r\nthickness of Air is represented by G[Greek: ph], or by any other\r\ndistance of the Ruler from AH.\r\n\r\nBut farther, since by the 10th Observation the thickness of Air was to\r\nthe thickness of Water, which between the same Glasses exhibited the\r\nsame Colour, as 4 to 3, and by the 21st Observation the Colours of thin\r\nBodies are not varied by varying the ambient Medium; the thickness of a\r\nBubble of Water, exhibiting any Colour, will be 3/4 of the thickness of\r\nAir producing the same Colour. And so according to the same 10th and\r\n21st Observations, the thickness of a Plate of Glass, whose Refraction\r\nof the mean refrangible Ray, is measured by the proportion of the Sines\r\n31 to 20, may be 20/31 of the thickness of Air producing the same\r\nColours; and the like of other Mediums. I do not affirm, that this\r\nproportion of 20 to 31, holds in all the Rays; for the Sines of other\r\nsorts of Rays have other Proportions. But the differences of those\r\nProportions are so little that I do not here consider them. On these\r\nGrounds I have composed the following Table, wherein the thickness of\r\nAir, Water, and Glass, at which each Colour is most intense and\r\nspecifick, is expressed in parts of an Inch divided into ten hundred\r\nthousand equal parts.\r\n\r\nNow if this Table be compared with the 6th Scheme, you will there see\r\nthe constitution of each Colour, as to its Ingredients, or the original\r\nColours of which it is compounded, and thence be enabled to judge of its\r\nIntenseness or Imperfection; which may suffice in explication of the 4th\r\nand 18th Observations, unless it be farther desired to delineate the\r\nmanner how the Colours appear, when the two Object-glasses are laid upon\r\none another. To do which, let there be described a large Arc of a\r\nCircle, and a streight Line which may touch that Arc, and parallel to\r\nthat Tangent several occult Lines, at such distances from it, as the\r\nNumbers set against the several Colours in the Table denote.

And so the bigness of the parts of natural\r\nBodies may be conjectured by their Colours, as shall be hereafter shewn.\r\nAlso, if two or more very thin Plates be laid one upon another, so as to\r\ncompose one Plate equalling them all in thickness, the resulting Colour\r\nmay be hereby determin'd. For instance, Mr. _Hook_ observed, as is\r\nmentioned in his _Micrographia_, that a faint yellow Plate of _Muscovy_\r\nGlass laid upon a blue one, constituted a very deep purple. The yellow\r\nof the first Order is a faint one, and the thickness of the Plate\r\nexhibiting it, according to the Table is 4-3/5, to which add 9, the\r\nthickness exhibiting blue of the second Order, and the Sum will be\r\n13-3/5, which is the thickness exhibiting the purple of the third Order.\r\n\r\nTo explain, in the next place, the circumstances of the 2d and 3d\r\nObservations; that is, how the Rings of the Colours may (by turning the\r\nPrisms about their common Axis the contrary way to that expressed in\r\nthose Observations) be converted into white and black Rings, and\r\nafterwards into Rings of Colours again, the Colours of each Ring lying\r\nnow in an inverted order; it must be remember'd, that those Rings of\r\nColours are dilated by the obliquation of the Rays to the Air which\r\nintercedes the Glasses, and that according to the Table in the 7th\r\nObservation, their Dilatation or Increase of their Diameter is most\r\nmanifest and speedy when they are obliquest. Now the Rays of yellow\r\nbeing more refracted by the first Superficies of the said Air than those\r\nof red, are thereby made more oblique to the second Superficies, at\r\nwhich they are reflected to produce the colour'd Rings, and consequently\r\nthe yellow Circle in each Ring will be more dilated than the red; and\r\nthe Excess of its Dilatation will be so much the greater, by how much\r\nthe greater is the obliquity of the Rays, until at last it become of\r\nequal extent with the red of the same Ring. And for the same reason the\r\ngreen, blue and violet, will be also so much dilated by the still\r\ngreater obliquity of their Rays, as to become all very nearly of equal\r\nextent with the red, that is, equally distant from the center of the\r\nRings. And then all the Colours of the same Ring must be co-incident,\r\nand by their mixture exhibit a white Ring. And these white Rings must\r\nhave black and dark Rings between them, because they do not spread and\r\ninterfere with one another, as before. And for that reason also they\r\nmust become distincter, and visible to far greater numbers. But yet the\r\nviolet being obliquest will be something more dilated, in proportion to\r\nits extent, than the other Colours, and so very apt to appear at the\r\nexterior Verges of the white.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, by a greater obliquity of the Rays, the violet and blue\r\nbecome more sensibly dilated than the red and yellow, and so being\r\nfarther removed from the center of the Rings, the Colours must emerge\r\nout of the white in an order contrary to that which they had before; the\r\nviolet and blue at the exterior Limbs of each Ring, and the red and\r\nyellow at the interior. And the violet, by reason of the greatest\r\nobliquity of its Rays, being in proportion most of all expanded, will\r\nsoonest appear at the exterior Limb of each white Ring, and become more\r\nconspicuous than the rest. And the several Series of Colours belonging\r\nto the several Rings, will, by their unfolding and spreading, begin\r\nagain to interfere, and thereby render the Rings less distinct, and not\r\nvisible to so great numbers.\r\n\r\nIf instead of the Prisms the Object-glasses be made use of, the Rings\r\nwhich they exhibit become not white and distinct by the obliquity of the\r\nEye, by reason that the Rays in their passage through that Air which\r\nintercedes the Glasses are very nearly parallel to those Lines in which\r\nthey were first incident on the Glasses, and consequently the Rays\r\nendued with several Colours are not inclined one more than another to\r\nthat Air, as it happens in the Prisms.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another circumstance of these Experiments to be consider'd,\r\nand that is why the black and white Rings which when view'd at a\r\ndistance appear distinct, should not only become confused by viewing\r\nthem near at hand, but also yield a violet Colour at both the edges of\r\nevery white Ring. And the reason is, that the Rays which enter the Eye\r\nat several parts of the Pupil, have several Obliquities to the Glasses,\r\nand those which are most oblique, if consider'd apart, would represent\r\nthe Rings bigger than those which are the least oblique. Whence the\r\nbreadth of the Perimeter of every white Ring is expanded outwards by the\r\nobliquest Rays, and inwards by the least oblique. And this Expansion is\r\nso much the greater by how much the greater is the difference of the\r\nObliquity; that is, by how much the Pupil is wider, or the Eye nearer to\r\nthe Glasses. And the breadth of the violet must be most expanded,\r\nbecause the Rays apt to excite a Sensation of that Colour are most\r\noblique to a second or farther Superficies of the thinn'd Air at which\r\nthey are reflected, and have also the greatest variation of Obliquity,\r\nwhich makes that Colour soonest emerge out of the edges of the white.\r\nAnd as the breadth of every Ring is thus augmented, the dark Intervals\r\nmust be diminish'd, until the neighbouring Rings become continuous, and\r\nare blended, the exterior first, and then those nearer the center; so\r\nthat they can no longer be distinguish'd apart, but seem to constitute\r\nan even and uniform whiteness.\r\n\r\nAmong all the Observations there is none accompanied with so odd\r\ncircumstances as the twenty-fourth. Of those the principal are, that in\r\nthin Plates, which to the naked Eye seem of an even and uniform\r\ntransparent whiteness, without any terminations of Shadows, the\r\nRefraction of a Prism should make Rings of Colours appear, whereas it\r\nusually makes Objects appear colour'd only there where they are\r\nterminated with Shadows, or have parts unequally luminous; and that it\r\nshould make those Rings exceedingly distinct and white, although it\r\nusually renders Objects confused and coloured. The Cause of these things\r\nyou will understand by considering, that all the Rings of Colours are\r\nreally in the Plate, when view'd with the naked Eye, although by reason\r\nof the great breadth of their Circumferences they so much interfere and\r\nare blended together, that they seem to constitute an uniform whiteness.\r\nBut when the Rays pass through the Prism to the Eye, the Orbits of the\r\nseveral Colours in every Ring are refracted, some more than others,\r\naccording to their degrees of Refrangibility: By which means the Colours\r\non one side of the Ring (that is in the circumference on one side of its\r\ncenter), become more unfolded and dilated, and those on the other side\r\nmore complicated and contracted. And where by a due Refraction they are\r\nso much contracted, that the several Rings become narrower than to\r\ninterfere with one another, they must appear distinct, and also white,\r\nif the constituent Colours be so much contracted as to be wholly\r\nco-incident. But on the other side, where the Orbit of every Ring is\r\nmade broader by the farther unfolding of its Colours, it must interfere\r\nmore with other Rings than before, and so become less distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nTo explain this a little farther, suppose the concentrick Circles AV,\r\nand BX, [in _Fig._ 7.] represent the red and violet of any Order, which,\r\ntogether with the intermediate Colours, constitute any one of these\r\nRings. Now these being view'd through a Prism, the violet Circle BX,\r\nwill, by a greater Refraction, be farther translated from its place than\r\nthe red AV, and so approach nearer to it on that side of the Circles,\r\ntowards which the Refractions are made. For instance, if the red be\r\ntranslated to _av_, the violet may be translated to _bx_, so as to\r\napproach nearer to it at _x_ than before; and if the red be farther\r\ntranslated to av, the violet may be so much farther translated to bx as\r\nto convene with it at x; and if the red be yet farther translated to\r\n[Greek: aY], the violet may be still so much farther translated to\r\n[Greek: bx] as to pass beyond it at [Greek: x], and convene with it at\r\n_e_ and _f_. And this being understood not only of the red and violet,\r\nbut of all the other intermediate Colours, and also of every revolution\r\nof those Colours, you will easily perceive how those of the same\r\nrevolution or order, by their nearness at _xv_ and [Greek: Yx], and\r\ntheir coincidence at xv, _e_ and _f_, ought to constitute pretty\r\ndistinct Arcs of Circles, especially at xv, or at _e_ and _f_; and that\r\nthey will appear severally at _x_[Greek: u] and at xv exhibit whiteness\r\nby their coincidence, and again appear severally at [Greek: Yx], but yet\r\nin a contrary order to that which they had before, and still retain\r\nbeyond _e_ and _f_. But on the other side, at _ab_, ab, or [Greek: ab],\r\nthese Colours must become much more confused by being dilated and spread\r\nso as to interfere with those of other Orders. And the same confusion\r\nwill happen at [Greek: Ux] between _e_ and _f_, if the Refraction be\r\nvery great, or the Prism very distant from the Object-glasses: In which\r\ncase no parts of the Rings will be seen, save only two little Arcs at\r\n_e_ and _f_, whose distance from one another will be augmented by\r\nremoving the Prism still farther from the Object-glasses: And these\r\nlittle Arcs must be distinctest and whitest at their middle, and at\r\ntheir ends, where they begin to grow confused, they must be colour'd.\r\nAnd the Colours at one end of every Arc must be in a contrary order to\r\nthose at the other end, by reason that they cross in the intermediate\r\nwhite; namely, their ends, which verge towards [Greek: Ux], will be red\r\nand yellow on that side next the center, and blue and violet on the\r\nother side. But their other ends which verge from [Greek: Ux], will on\r\nthe contrary be blue and violet on that side towards the center, and on\r\nthe other side red and yellow.\r\n\r\nNow as all these things follow from the properties of Light by a\r\nmathematical way of reasoning, so the truth of them may be manifested by\r\nExperiments. For in a dark Room, by viewing these Rings through a Prism,\r\nby reflexion of the several prismatick Colours, which an assistant\r\ncauses to move to and fro upon a Wall or Paper from whence they are\r\nreflected, whilst the Spectator's Eye, the Prism, and the\r\nObject-glasses, (as in the 13th Observation,) are placed steady; the\r\nPosition of the Circles made successively by the several Colours, will\r\nbe found such, in respect of one another, as I have described in the\r\nFigures _abxv_, or abxv, or _[Greek: abxU]_. And by the same method the\r\ntruth of the Explications of other Observations may be examined.\r\n\r\nBy what hath been said, the like Phaenomena of Water and thin Plates of\r\nGlass may be understood. But in small fragments of those Plates there is\r\nthis farther observable, that where they lie flat upon a Table, and are\r\nturned about their centers whilst they are view'd through a Prism, they\r\nwill in some postures exhibit Waves of various Colours; and some of them\r\nexhibit these Waves in one or two Positions only, but the most of them\r\ndo in all Positions exhibit them, and make them for the most part appear\r\nalmost all over the Plates. The reason is, that the Superficies of such\r\nPlates are not even, but have many Cavities and Swellings, which, how\r\nshallow soever, do a little vary the thickness of the Plate. For at the\r\nseveral sides of those Cavities, for the Reasons newly described, there\r\nought to be produced Waves in several postures of the Prism. Now though\r\nit be but some very small and narrower parts of the Glass, by which\r\nthese Waves for the most part are caused, yet they may seem to extend\r\nthemselves over the whole Glass, because from the narrowest of those\r\nparts there are Colours of several Orders, that is, of several Rings,\r\nconfusedly reflected, which by Refraction of the Prism are unfolded,\r\nseparated, and, according to their degrees of Refraction, dispersed to\r\nseveral places, so as to constitute so many several Waves, as there were\r\ndivers orders of Colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the\r\nGlass.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal Phaenomena of thin Plates or Bubbles, whose\r\nExplications depend on the properties of Light, which I have heretofore\r\ndeliver'd. And these you see do necessarily follow from them, and agree\r\nwith them, even to their very least circumstances; and not only so, but\r\ndo very much tend to their proof. Thus, by the 24th Observation it\r\nappears, that the Rays of several Colours, made as well by thin Plates\r\nor Bubbles, as by Refractions of a Prism, have several degrees of\r\nRefrangibility; whereby those of each order, which at the reflexion from\r\nthe Plate or Bubble are intermix'd with those of other orders, are\r\nseparated from them by Refraction, and associated together so as to\r\nbecome visible by themselves like Arcs of Circles. For if the Rays were\r\nall alike refrangible, 'tis impossible that the whiteness, which to the\r\nnaked Sense appears uniform, should by Refraction have its parts\r\ntransposed and ranged into those black and white Arcs.\r\n\r\nIt appears also that the unequal Refractions of difform Rays proceed not\r\nfrom any contingent irregularities; such as are Veins, an uneven Polish,\r\nor fortuitous Position of the Pores of Glass; unequal and casual Motions\r\nin the Air or AEther, the spreading, breaking, or dividing the same Ray\r\ninto many diverging parts; or the like. For, admitting any such\r\nirregularities, it would be impossible for Refractions to render those\r\nRings so very distinct, and well defined, as they do in the 24th\r\nObservation. It is necessary therefore that every Ray have its proper\r\nand constant degree of Refrangibility connate with it, according to\r\nwhich its refraction is ever justly and regularly perform'd; and that\r\nseveral Rays have several of those degrees.\r\n\r\nAnd what is said of their Refrangibility may be also understood of their\r\nReflexibility, that is, of their Dispositions to be reflected, some at a\r\ngreater, and others at a less thickness of thin Plates or Bubbles;\r\nnamely, that those Dispositions are also connate with the Rays, and\r\nimmutable; as may appear by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Observations,\r\ncompared with the fourth and eighteenth.\r\n\r\nBy the Precedent Observations it appears also, that whiteness is a\r\ndissimilar mixture of all Colours, and that Light is a mixture of Rays\r\nendued with all those Colours. For, considering the multitude of the\r\nRings of Colours in the 3d, 12th, and 24th Observations, it is manifest,\r\nthat although in the 4th and 18th Observations there appear no more than\r\neight or nine of those Rings, yet there are really a far greater number,\r\nwhich so much interfere and mingle with one another, as after those\r\neight or nine revolutions to dilute one another wholly, and constitute\r\nan even and sensibly uniform whiteness. And consequently that whiteness\r\nmust be allow'd a mixture of all Colours, and the Light which conveys it\r\nto the Eye must be a mixture of Rays endued with all those Colours.\r\n\r\nBut farther; by the 24th Observation it appears, that there is a\r\nconstant relation between Colours and Refrangibility; the most\r\nrefrangible Rays being violet, the least refrangible red, and those of\r\nintermediate Colours having proportionably intermediate degrees of\r\nRefrangibility. And by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Observations, compared\r\nwith the 4th or 18th there appears to be the same constant relation\r\nbetween Colour and Reflexibility; the violet being in like circumstances\r\nreflected at least thicknesses of any thin Plate or Bubble, the red at\r\ngreatest thicknesses, and the intermediate Colours at intermediate\r\nthicknesses. Whence it follows, that the colorifick Dispositions of\r\nRays are also connate with them, and immutable; and by consequence, that\r\nall the Productions and Appearances of Colours in the World are derived,\r\nnot from any physical Change caused in Light by Refraction or Reflexion,\r\nbut only from the various Mixtures or Separations of Rays, by virtue of\r\ntheir different Refrangibility or Reflexibility. And in this respect the\r\nScience of Colours becomes a Speculation as truly mathematical as any\r\nother part of Opticks. I mean, so far as they depend on the Nature of\r\nLight, and are not produced or alter'd by the Power of Imagination, or\r\nby striking or pressing the Eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nSECOND BOOK\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nOPTICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART III._\r\n\r\n_Of the permanent Colours of natural Bodies, and the Analogy between\r\nthem and the Colours of thin transparent Plates._\r\n\r\nI am now come to another part of this Design, which is to consider how\r\nthe Phaenomena of thin transparent Plates stand related to those of all\r\nother natural Bodies. Of these Bodies I have already told you that they\r\nappear of divers Colours, accordingly as they are disposed to reflect\r\nmost copiously the Rays originally endued with those Colours. But their\r\nConstitutions, whereby they reflect some Rays more copiously than\r\nothers, remain to be discover'd; and these I shall endeavour to manifest\r\nin the following Propositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. I.\r\n\r\n_Those Superficies of transparent Bodies reflect the greatest quantity\r\nof Light, which have the greatest refracting Power; that is, which\r\nintercede Mediums that differ most in their refractive Densities. And in\r\nthe Confines of equally refracting Mediums there is no Reflexion._\r\n\r\nThe Analogy between Reflexion and Refraction will appear by considering,\r\nthat when Light passeth obliquely out of one Medium into another which\r\nrefracts from the perpendicular, the greater is the difference of their\r\nrefractive Density, the less Obliquity of Incidence is requisite to\r\ncause a total Reflexion. For as the Sines are which measure the\r\nRefraction, so is the Sine of Incidence at which the total Reflexion\r\nbegins, to the Radius of the Circle; and consequently that Angle of\r\nIncidence is least where there is the greatest difference of the Sines.\r\nThus in the passing of Light out of Water into Air, where the Refraction\r\nis measured by the Ratio of the Sines 3 to 4, the total Reflexion begins\r\nwhen the Angle of Incidence is about 48 Degrees 35 Minutes. In passing\r\nout of Glass into Air, where the Refraction is measured by the Ratio of\r\nthe Sines 20 to 31, the total Reflexion begins when the Angle of\r\nIncidence is 40 Degrees 10 Minutes; and so in passing out of Crystal, or\r\nmore strongly refracting Mediums into Air, there is still a less\r\nobliquity requisite to cause a total reflexion. Superficies therefore\r\nwhich refract most do soonest reflect all the Light which is incident on\r\nthem, and so must be allowed most strongly reflexive.\r\n\r\nBut the truth of this Proposition will farther appear by observing, that\r\nin the Superficies interceding two transparent Mediums, (such as are\r\nAir, Water, Oil, common Glass, Crystal, metalline Glasses, Island\r\nGlasses, white transparent Arsenick, Diamonds, &c.) the Reflexion is\r\nstronger or weaker accordingly, as the Superficies hath a greater or\r\nless refracting Power. For in the Confine of Air and Sal-gem 'tis\r\nstronger than in the Confine of Air and Water, and still stronger in the\r\nConfine of Air and common Glass or Crystal, and stronger in the Confine\r\nof Air and a Diamond. If any of these, and such like transparent Solids,\r\nbe immerged in Water, its Reflexion becomes, much weaker than before;\r\nand still weaker if they be immerged in the more strongly refracting\r\nLiquors of well rectified Oil of Vitriol or Spirit of Turpentine. If\r\nWater be distinguish'd into two parts by any imaginary Surface, the\r\nReflexion in the Confine of those two parts is none at all. In the\r\nConfine of Water and Ice 'tis very little; in that of Water and Oil 'tis\r\nsomething greater; in that of Water and Sal-gem still greater; and in\r\nthat of Water and Glass, or Crystal or other denser Substances still\r\ngreater, accordingly as those Mediums differ more or less in their\r\nrefracting Powers. Hence in the Confine of common Glass and Crystal,\r\nthere ought to be a weak Reflexion, and a stronger Reflexion in the\r\nConfine of common and metalline Glass; though I have not yet tried\r\nthis. But in the Confine of two Glasses of equal density, there is not\r\nany sensible Reflexion; as was shewn in the first Observation. And the\r\nsame may be understood of the Superficies interceding two Crystals, or\r\ntwo Liquors, or any other Substances in which no Refraction is caused.\r\nSo then the reason why uniform pellucid Mediums (such as Water, Glass,\r\nor Crystal,) have no sensible Reflexion but in their external\r\nSuperficies, where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different\r\ndensity, is because all their contiguous parts have one and the same\r\ndegree of density.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. II.\r\n\r\n_The least parts of almost all natural Bodies are in some measure\r\ntransparent: And the Opacity of those Bodies ariseth from the multitude\r\nof Reflexions caused in their internal Parts._\r\n\r\nThat this is so has been observed by others, and will easily be granted\r\nby them that have been conversant with Microscopes. And it may be also\r\ntried by applying any substance to a hole through which some Light is\r\nimmitted into a dark Room. For how opake soever that Substance may seem\r\nin the open Air, it will by that means appear very manifestly\r\ntransparent, if it be of a sufficient thinness. Only white metalline\r\nBodies must be excepted, which by reason of their excessive density seem\r\nto reflect almost all the Light incident on their first Superficies;\r\nunless by solution in Menstruums they be reduced into very small\r\nParticles, and then they become transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. III.\r\n\r\n_Between the parts of opake and colour'd Bodies are many Spaces, either\r\nempty, or replenish'd with Mediums of other Densities; as Water between\r\nthe tinging Corpuscles wherewith any Liquor is impregnated, Air between\r\nthe aqueous Globules that constitute Clouds or Mists; and for the most\r\npart Spaces void of both Air and Water, but yet perhaps not wholly void\r\nof all Substance, between the parts of hard Bodies._\r\n\r\nThe truth of this is evinced by the two precedent Propositions: For by\r\nthe second Proposition there are many Reflexions made by the internal\r\nparts of Bodies, which, by the first Proposition, would not happen if\r\nthe parts of those Bodies were continued without any such Interstices\r\nbetween them; because Reflexions are caused only in Superficies, which\r\nintercede Mediums of a differing density, by _Prop._ 1.\r\n\r\nBut farther, that this discontinuity of parts is the principal Cause of\r\nthe opacity of Bodies, will appear by considering, that opake Substances\r\nbecome transparent by filling their Pores with any Substance of equal or\r\nalmost equal density with their parts. Thus Paper dipped in Water or\r\nOil, the _Oculus Mundi_ Stone steep'd in Water, Linnen Cloth oiled or\r\nvarnish'd, and many other Substances soaked in such Liquors as will\r\nintimately pervade their little Pores, become by that means more\r\ntransparent than otherwise; so, on the contrary, the most transparent\r\nSubstances, may, by evacuating their Pores, or separating their parts,\r\nbe render'd sufficiently opake; as Salts or wet Paper, or the _Oculus\r\nMundi_ Stone by being dried, Horn by being scraped, Glass by being\r\nreduced to Powder, or otherwise flawed; Turpentine by being stirred\r\nabout with Water till they mix imperfectly, and Water by being form'd\r\ninto many small Bubbles, either alone in the form of Froth, or by\r\nshaking it together with Oil of Turpentine, or Oil Olive, or with some\r\nother convenient Liquor, with which it will not perfectly incorporate.\r\nAnd to the increase of the opacity of these Bodies, it conduces\r\nsomething, that by the 23d Observation the Reflexions of very thin\r\ntransparent Substances are considerably stronger than those made by the\r\nsame Substances of a greater thickness.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. IV.\r\n\r\n_The Parts of Bodies and their Interstices must not be less than of some\r\ndefinite bigness, to render them opake and colour'd._\r\n\r\nFor the opakest Bodies, if their parts be subtilly divided, (as Metals,\r\nby being dissolved in acid Menstruums, &c.) become perfectly\r\ntransparent. And you may also remember, that in the eighth Observation\r\nthere was no sensible reflexion at the Superficies of the\r\nObject-glasses, where they were very near one another, though they did\r\nnot absolutely touch. And in the 17th Observation the Reflexion of the\r\nWater-bubble where it became thinnest was almost insensible, so as to\r\ncause very black Spots to appear on the top of the Bubble, by the want\r\nof reflected Light.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds I perceive it is that Water, Salt, Glass, Stones, and\r\nsuch like Substances, are transparent. For, upon divers Considerations,\r\nthey seem to be as full of Pores or Interstices between their parts as\r\nother Bodies are, but yet their Parts and Interstices to be too small to\r\ncause Reflexions in their common Surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. V.\r\n\r\n_The transparent parts of Bodies, according to their several sizes,\r\nreflect Rays of one Colour, and transmit those of another, on the same\r\ngrounds that thin Plates or Bubbles do reflect or transmit those Rays.\r\nAnd this I take to be the ground of all their Colours._\r\n\r\nFor if a thinn'd or plated Body, which being of an even thickness,\r\nappears all over of one uniform Colour, should be slit into Threads, or\r\nbroken into Fragments, of the same thickness with the Plate; I see no\r\nreason why every Thread or Fragment should not keep its Colour, and by\r\nconsequence why a heap of those Threads or Fragments should not\r\nconstitute a Mass or Powder of the same Colour, which the Plate\r\nexhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all natural Bodies\r\nbeing like so many Fragments of a Plate, must on the same grounds\r\nexhibit the same Colours.\r\n\r\nNow, that they do so will appear by the affinity of their Properties.\r\nThe finely colour'd Feathers of some Birds, and particularly those of\r\nPeacocks Tails, do, in the very same part of the Feather, appear of\r\nseveral Colours in several Positions of the Eye, after the very same\r\nmanner that thin Plates were found to do in the 7th and 19th\r\nObservations, and therefore their Colours arise from the thinness of the\r\ntransparent parts of the Feathers; that is, from the slenderness of the\r\nvery fine Hairs, or _Capillamenta_, which grow out of the sides of the\r\ngrosser lateral Branches or Fibres of those Feathers. And to the same\r\npurpose it is, that the Webs of some Spiders, by being spun very fine,\r\nhave appeared colour'd, as some have observ'd, and that the colour'd\r\nFibres of some Silks, by varying the Position of the Eye, do vary their\r\nColour. Also the Colours of Silks, Cloths, and other Substances, which\r\nWater or Oil can intimately penetrate, become more faint and obscure by\r\nbeing immerged in those Liquors, and recover their Vigor again by being\r\ndried; much after the manner declared of thin Bodies in the 10th and\r\n21st Observations. Leaf-Gold, some sorts of painted Glass, the Infusion\r\nof _Lignum Nephriticum_, and some other Substances, reflect one Colour,\r\nand transmit another; like thin Bodies in the 9th and 20th Observations.\r\nAnd some of those colour'd Powders which Painters use, may have their\r\nColours a little changed, by being very elaborately and finely ground.\r\nWhere I see not what can be justly pretended for those changes, besides\r\nthe breaking of their parts into less parts by that contrition, after\r\nthe same manner that the Colour of a thin Plate is changed by varying\r\nits thickness. For which reason also it is that the colour'd Flowers of\r\nPlants and Vegetables, by being bruised, usually become more transparent\r\nthan before, or at least in some degree or other change their Colours.\r\nNor is it much less to my purpose, that, by mixing divers Liquors, very\r\nodd and remarkable Productions and Changes of Colours may be effected,\r\nof which no cause can be more obvious and rational than that the saline\r\nCorpuscles of one Liquor do variously act upon or unite with the tinging\r\nCorpuscles of another, so as to make them swell, or shrink, (whereby not\r\nonly their bulk but their density also may be changed,) or to divide\r\nthem into smaller Corpuscles, (whereby a colour'd Liquor may become\r\ntransparent,) or to make many of them associate into one cluster,\r\nwhereby two transparent Liquors may compose a colour'd one. For we see\r\nhow apt those saline Menstruums are to penetrate and dissolve Substances\r\nto which they are applied, and some of them to precipitate what others\r\ndissolve. In like manner, if we consider the various Phaenomena of the\r\nAtmosphere, we may observe, that when Vapours are first raised, they\r\nhinder not the transparency of the Air, being divided into parts too\r\nsmall to cause any Reflexion in their Superficies. But when in order to\r\ncompose drops of Rain they begin to coalesce and constitute Globules of\r\nall intermediate sizes, those Globules, when they become of convenient\r\nsize to reflect some Colours and transmit others, may constitute Clouds\r\nof various Colours according to their sizes. And I see not what can be\r\nrationally conceived in so transparent a Substance as Water for the\r\nproduction of these Colours, besides the various sizes of its fluid and\r\nglobular Parcels.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. VI.\r\n\r\n_The parts of Bodies on which their Colours depend, are denser than the\r\nMedium which pervades their Interstices._\r\n\r\nThis will appear by considering, that the Colour of a Body depends not\r\nonly on the Rays which are incident perpendicularly on its parts, but on\r\nthose also which are incident at all other Angles. And that according to\r\nthe 7th Observation, a very little variation of obliquity will change\r\nthe reflected Colour, where the thin Body or small Particles is rarer\r\nthan the ambient Medium, insomuch that such a small Particle will at\r\ndiversly oblique Incidences reflect all sorts of Colours, in so great a\r\nvariety that the Colour resulting from them all, confusedly reflected\r\nfrom a heap of such Particles, must rather be a white or grey than any\r\nother Colour, or at best it must be but a very imperfect and dirty\r\nColour. Whereas if the thin Body or small Particle be much denser than\r\nthe ambient Medium, the Colours, according to the 19th Observation, are\r\nso little changed by the variation of obliquity, that the Rays which\r\nare reflected least obliquely may predominate over the rest, so much as\r\nto cause a heap of such Particles to appear very intensely of their\r\nColour.\r\n\r\nIt conduces also something to the confirmation of this Proposition,\r\nthat, according to the 22d Observation, the Colours exhibited by the\r\ndenser thin Body within the rarer, are more brisk than those exhibited\r\nby the rarer within the denser.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. VII.\r\n\r\n_The bigness of the component parts of natural Bodies may be conjectured\r\nby their Colours._\r\n\r\nFor since the parts of these Bodies, by _Prop._ 5. do most probably\r\nexhibit the same Colours with a Plate of equal thickness, provided they\r\nhave the same refractive density; and since their parts seem for the\r\nmost part to have much the same density with Water or Glass, as by many\r\ncircumstances is obvious to collect; to determine the sizes of those\r\nparts, you need only have recourse to the precedent Tables, in which the\r\nthickness of Water or Glass exhibiting any Colour is expressed. Thus if\r\nit be desired to know the diameter of a Corpuscle, which being of equal\r\ndensity with Glass shall reflect green of the third Order; the Number\r\n16-1/4 shews it to be (16-1/4)/10000 parts of an Inch.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty is here to know of what Order the Colour of any\r\nBody is. And for this end we must have recourse to the 4th and 18th\r\nObservations; from whence may be collected these particulars.\r\n\r\n_Scarlets_, and other _reds_, _oranges_, and _yellows_, if they be pure\r\nand intense, are most probably of the second order. Those of the first\r\nand third order also may be pretty good; only the yellow of the first\r\norder is faint, and the orange and red of the third Order have a great\r\nMixture of violet and blue.\r\n\r\nThere may be good _Greens_ of the fourth Order, but the purest are of\r\nthe third. And of this Order the green of all Vegetables seems to be,\r\npartly by reason of the Intenseness of their Colours, and partly because\r\nwhen they wither some of them turn to a greenish yellow, and others to a\r\nmore perfect yellow or orange, or perhaps to red, passing first through\r\nall the aforesaid intermediate Colours. Which Changes seem to be\r\neffected by the exhaling of the Moisture which may leave the tinging\r\nCorpuscles more dense, and something augmented by the Accretion of the\r\noily and earthy Part of that Moisture. Now the green, without doubt, is\r\nof the same Order with those Colours into which it changeth, because the\r\nChanges are gradual, and those Colours, though usually not very full,\r\nyet are often too full and lively to be of the fourth Order.\r\n\r\n_Blues_ and _Purples_ may be either of the second or third Order, but\r\nthe best are of the third. Thus the Colour of Violets seems to be of\r\nthat Order, because their Syrup by acid Liquors turns red, and by\r\nurinous and alcalizate turns green. For since it is of the Nature of\r\nAcids to dissolve or attenuate, and of Alcalies to precipitate or\r\nincrassate, if the Purple Colour of the Syrup was of the second Order,\r\nan acid Liquor by attenuating its tinging Corpuscles would change it to\r\na red of the first Order, and an Alcali by incrassating them would\r\nchange it to a green of the second Order; which red and green,\r\nespecially the green, seem too imperfect to be the Colours produced by\r\nthese Changes. But if the said Purple be supposed of the third Order,\r\nits Change to red of the second, and green of the third, may without any\r\nInconvenience be allow'd.\r\n\r\nIf there be found any Body of a deeper and less reddish Purple than that\r\nof the Violets, its Colour most probably is of the second Order. But yet\r\nthere being no Body commonly known whose Colour is constantly more deep\r\nthan theirs, I have made use of their Name to denote the deepest and\r\nleast reddish Purples, such as manifestly transcend their Colour in\r\npurity.\r\n\r\nThe _blue_ of the first Order, though very faint and little, may\r\npossibly be the Colour of some Substances; and particularly the azure\r\nColour of the Skies seems to be of this Order. For all Vapours when they\r\nbegin to condense and coalesce into small Parcels, become first of that\r\nBigness, whereby such an Azure must be reflected before they can\r\nconstitute Clouds of other Colours. And so this being the first Colour\r\nwhich Vapours begin to reflect, it ought to be the Colour of the finest\r\nand most transparent Skies, in which Vapours are not arrived to that\r\nGrossness requisite to reflect other Colours, as we find it is by\r\nExperience.\r\n\r\n_Whiteness_, if most intense and luminous, is that of the first Order,\r\nif less strong and luminous, a Mixture of the Colours of several Orders.\r\nOf this last kind is the Whiteness of Froth, Paper, Linnen, and most\r\nwhite Substances; of the former I reckon that of white Metals to be. For\r\nwhilst the densest of Metals, Gold, if foliated, is transparent, and all\r\nMetals become transparent if dissolved in Menstruums or vitrified, the\r\nOpacity of white Metals ariseth not from their Density alone. They being\r\nless dense than Gold would be more transparent than it, did not some\r\nother Cause concur with their Density to make them opake. And this Cause\r\nI take to be such a Bigness of their Particles as fits them to reflect\r\nthe white of the first order. For, if they be of other Thicknesses they\r\nmay reflect other Colours, as is manifest by the Colours which appear\r\nupon hot Steel in tempering it, and sometimes upon the Surface of melted\r\nMetals in the Skin or Scoria which arises upon them in their cooling.\r\nAnd as the white of the first order is the strongest which can be made\r\nby Plates of transparent Substances, so it ought to be stronger in the\r\ndenser Substances of Metals than in the rarer of Air, Water, and Glass.\r\nNor do I see but that metallick Substances of such a Thickness as may\r\nfit them to reflect the white of the first order, may, by reason of\r\ntheir great Density (according to the Tenor of the first of these\r\nPropositions) reflect all the Light incident upon them, and so be as\r\nopake and splendent as it's possible for any Body to be. Gold, or Copper\r\nmix'd with less than half their Weight of Silver, or Tin, or Regulus of\r\nAntimony, in fusion, or amalgamed with a very little Mercury, become\r\nwhite; which shews both that the Particles of white Metals have much\r\nmore Superficies, and so are smaller, than those of Gold and Copper, and\r\nalso that they are so opake as not to suffer the Particles of Gold or\r\nCopper to shine through them. Now it is scarce to be doubted but that\r\nthe Colours of Gold and Copper are of the second and third order, and\r\ntherefore the Particles of white Metals cannot be much bigger than is\r\nrequisite to make them reflect the white of the first order. The\r\nVolatility of Mercury argues that they are not much bigger, nor may they\r\nbe much less, lest they lose their Opacity, and become either\r\ntransparent as they do when attenuated by Vitrification, or by Solution\r\nin Menstruums, or black as they do when ground smaller, by rubbing\r\nSilver, or Tin, or Lead, upon other Substances to draw black Lines. The\r\nfirst and only Colour which white Metals take by grinding their\r\nParticles smaller, is black, and therefore their white ought to be that\r\nwhich borders upon the black Spot in the Center of the Rings of Colours,\r\nthat is, the white of the first order. But, if you would hence gather\r\nthe Bigness of metallick Particles, you must allow for their Density.\r\nFor were Mercury transparent, its Density is such that the Sine of\r\nIncidence upon it (by my Computation) would be to the Sine of its\r\nRefraction, as 71 to 20, or 7 to 2. And therefore the Thickness of its\r\nParticles, that they may exhibit the same Colours with those of Bubbles\r\nof Water, ought to be less than the Thickness of the Skin of those\r\nBubbles in the Proportion of 2 to 7. Whence it's possible, that the\r\nParticles of Mercury may be as little as the Particles of some\r\ntransparent and volatile Fluids, and yet reflect the white of the first\r\norder.\r\n\r\nLastly, for the production of _black_, the Corpuscles must be less than\r\nany of those which exhibit Colours. For at all greater sizes there is\r\ntoo much Light reflected to constitute this Colour. But if they be\r\nsupposed a little less than is requisite to reflect the white and very\r\nfaint blue of the first order, they will, according to the 4th, 8th,\r\n17th and 18th Observations, reflect so very little Light as to appear\r\nintensely black, and yet may perhaps variously refract it to and fro\r\nwithin themselves so long, until it happen to be stifled and lost, by\r\nwhich means they will appear black in all positions of the Eye without\r\nany transparency. And from hence may be understood why Fire, and the\r\nmore subtile dissolver Putrefaction, by dividing the Particles of\r\nSubstances, turn them to black, why small quantities of black Substances\r\nimpart their Colour very freely and intensely to other Substances to\r\nwhich they are applied; the minute Particles of these, by reason of\r\ntheir very great number, easily overspreading the gross Particles of\r\nothers; why Glass ground very elaborately with Sand on a Copper Plate,\r\n'till it be well polish'd, makes the Sand, together with what is worn\r\noff from the Glass and Copper, become very black: why black Substances\r\ndo soonest of all others become hot in the Sun's Light and burn, (which\r\nEffect may proceed partly from the multitude of Refractions in a little\r\nroom, and partly from the easy Commotion of so very small Corpuscles;)\r\nand why blacks are usually a little inclined to a bluish Colour. For\r\nthat they are so may be seen by illuminating white Paper by Light\r\nreflected from black Substances. For the Paper will usually appear of a\r\nbluish white; and the reason is, that black borders in the obscure blue\r\nof the order described in the 18th Observation, and therefore reflects\r\nmore Rays of that Colour than of any other.\r\n\r\nIn these Descriptions I have been the more particular, because it is not\r\nimpossible but that Microscopes may at length be improved to the\r\ndiscovery of the Particles of Bodies on which their Colours depend, if\r\nthey are not already in some measure arrived to that degree of\r\nperfection. For if those Instruments are or can be so far improved as\r\nwith sufficient distinctness to represent Objects five or six hundred\r\ntimes bigger than at a Foot distance they appear to our naked Eyes, I\r\nshould hope that we might be able to discover some of the greatest of\r\nthose Corpuscles. And by one that would magnify three or four thousand\r\ntimes perhaps they might all be discover'd, but those which produce\r\nblackness. In the mean while I see nothing material in this Discourse\r\nthat may rationally be doubted of, excepting this Position: That\r\ntransparent Corpuscles of the same thickness and density with a Plate,\r\ndo exhibit the same Colour. And this I would have understood not without\r\nsome Latitude, as well because those Corpuscles may be of irregular\r\nFigures, and many Rays must be obliquely incident on them, and so have\r\na shorter way through them than the length of their Diameters, as\r\nbecause the straitness of the Medium put in on all sides within such\r\nCorpuscles may a little alter its Motions or other qualities on which\r\nthe Reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last, because I\r\nhave observed of some small Plates of Muscovy Glass which were of an\r\neven thickness, that through a Microscope they have appeared of the same\r\nColour at their edges and corners where the included Medium was\r\nterminated, which they appeared of in other places. However it will add\r\nmuch to our Satisfaction, if those Corpuscles can be discover'd with\r\nMicroscopes; which if we shall at length attain to, I fear it will be\r\nthe utmost improvement of this Sense. For it seems impossible to see the\r\nmore secret and noble Works of Nature within the Corpuscles by reason of\r\ntheir transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_The Cause of Reflexion is not the impinging of Light on the solid or\r\nimpervious parts of Bodies, as is commonly believed._\r\n\r\nThis will appear by the following Considerations. First, That in the\r\npassage of Light out of Glass into Air there is a Reflexion as strong as\r\nin its passage out of Air into Glass, or rather a little stronger, and\r\nby many degrees stronger than in its passage out of Glass into Water.\r\nAnd it seems not probable that Air should have more strongly reflecting\r\nparts than Water or Glass. But if that should possibly be supposed, yet\r\nit will avail nothing; for the Reflexion is as strong or stronger when\r\nthe Air is drawn away from the Glass, (suppose by the Air-Pump invented\r\nby _Otto Gueriet_, and improved and made useful by Mr. _Boyle_) as when\r\nit is adjacent to it. Secondly, If Light in its passage out of Glass\r\ninto Air be incident more obliquely than at an Angle of 40 or 41 Degrees\r\nit is wholly reflected, if less obliquely it is in great measure\r\ntransmitted. Now it is not to be imagined that Light at one degree of\r\nobliquity should meet with Pores enough in the Air to transmit the\r\ngreater part of it, and at another degree of obliquity should meet with\r\nnothing but parts to reflect it wholly, especially considering that in\r\nits passage out of Air into Glass, how oblique soever be its Incidence,\r\nit finds Pores enough in the Glass to transmit a great part of it. If\r\nany Man suppose that it is not reflected by the Air, but by the outmost\r\nsuperficial parts of the Glass, there is still the same difficulty:\r\nBesides, that such a Supposition is unintelligible, and will also appear\r\nto be false by applying Water behind some part of the Glass instead of\r\nAir. For so in a convenient obliquity of the Rays, suppose of 45 or 46\r\nDegrees, at which they are all reflected where the Air is adjacent to\r\nthe Glass, they shall be in great measure transmitted where the Water is\r\nadjacent to it; which argues, that their Reflexion or Transmission\r\ndepends on the constitution of the Air and Water behind the Glass, and\r\nnot on the striking of the Rays upon the parts of the Glass. Thirdly,\r\nIf the Colours made by a Prism placed at the entrance of a Beam of Light\r\ninto a darken'd Room be successively cast on a second Prism placed at a\r\ngreater distance from the former, in such manner that they are all alike\r\nincident upon it, the second Prism may be so inclined to the incident\r\nRays, that those which are of a blue Colour shall be all reflected by\r\nit, and yet those of a red Colour pretty copiously transmitted. Now if\r\nthe Reflexion be caused by the parts of Air or Glass, I would ask, why\r\nat the same Obliquity of Incidence the blue should wholly impinge on\r\nthose parts, so as to be all reflected, and yet the red find Pores\r\nenough to be in a great measure transmitted. Fourthly, Where two Glasses\r\ntouch one another, there is no sensible Reflexion, as was declared in\r\nthe first Observation; and yet I see no reason why the Rays should not\r\nimpinge on the parts of Glass, as much when contiguous to other Glass as\r\nwhen contiguous to Air. Fifthly, When the top of a Water-Bubble (in the\r\n17th Observation,) by the continual subsiding and exhaling of the Water\r\ngrew very thin, there was such a little and almost insensible quantity\r\nof Light reflected from it, that it appeared intensely black; whereas\r\nround about that black Spot, where the Water was thicker, the Reflexion\r\nwas so strong as to make the Water seem very white. Nor is it only at\r\nthe least thickness of thin Plates or Bubbles, that there is no manifest\r\nReflexion, but at many other thicknesses continually greater and\r\ngreater. For in the 15th Observation the Rays of the same Colour were by\r\nturns transmitted at one thickness, and reflected at another thickness,\r\nfor an indeterminate number of Successions. And yet in the Superficies\r\nof the thinned Body, where it is of any one thickness, there are as many\r\nparts for the Rays to impinge on, as where it is of any other thickness.\r\nSixthly, If Reflexion were caused by the parts of reflecting Bodies, it\r\nwould be impossible for thin Plates or Bubbles, at one and the same\r\nplace, to reflect the Rays of one Colour, and transmit those of another,\r\nas they do according to the 13th and 15th Observations. For it is not to\r\nbe imagined that at one place the Rays which, for instance, exhibit a\r\nblue Colour, should have the fortune to dash upon the parts, and those\r\nwhich exhibit a red to hit upon the Pores of the Body; and then at\r\nanother place, where the Body is either a little thicker or a little\r\nthinner, that on the contrary the blue should hit upon its pores, and\r\nthe red upon its parts. Lastly, Were the Rays of Light reflected by\r\nimpinging on the solid parts of Bodies, their Reflexions from polish'd\r\nBodies could not be so regular as they are. For in polishing Glass with\r\nSand, Putty, or Tripoly, it is not to be imagined that those Substances\r\ncan, by grating and fretting the Glass, bring all its least Particles to\r\nan accurate Polish; so that all their Surfaces shall be truly plain or\r\ntruly spherical, and look all the same way, so as together to compose\r\none even Surface. The smaller the Particles of those Substances are, the\r\nsmaller will be the Scratches by which they continually fret and wear\r\naway the Glass until it be polish'd; but be they never so small they can\r\nwear away the Glass no otherwise than by grating and scratching it, and\r\nbreaking the Protuberances; and therefore polish it no otherwise than by\r\nbringing its roughness to a very fine Grain, so that the Scratches and\r\nFrettings of the Surface become too small to be visible. And therefore\r\nif Light were reflected by impinging upon the solid parts of the Glass,\r\nit would be scatter'd as much by the most polish'd Glass as by the\r\nroughest. So then it remains a Problem, how Glass polish'd by fretting\r\nSubstances can reflect Light so regularly as it does. And this Problem\r\nis scarce otherwise to be solved, than by saying, that the Reflexion of\r\na Ray is effected, not by a single point of the reflecting Body, but by\r\nsome power of the Body which is evenly diffused all over its Surface,\r\nand by which it acts upon the Ray without immediate Contact. For that\r\nthe parts of Bodies do act upon Light at a distance shall be shewn\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nNow if Light be reflected, not by impinging on the solid parts of\r\nBodies, but by some other principle; it's probable that as many of its\r\nRays as impinge on the solid parts of Bodies are not reflected but\r\nstifled and lost in the Bodies. For otherwise we must allow two sorts of\r\nReflexions. Should all the Rays be reflected which impinge on the\r\ninternal parts of clear Water or Crystal, those Substances would rather\r\nhave a cloudy Colour than a clear Transparency. To make Bodies look\r\nblack, it's necessary that many Rays be stopp'd, retained, and lost in\r\nthem; and it seems not probable that any Rays can be stopp'd and\r\nstifled in them which do not impinge on their parts.\r\n\r\nAnd hence we may understand that Bodies are much more rare and porous\r\nthan is commonly believed. Water is nineteen times lighter, and by\r\nconsequence nineteen times rarer than Gold; and Gold is so rare as very\r\nreadily and without the least opposition to transmit the magnetick\r\nEffluvia, and easily to admit Quicksilver into its Pores, and to let\r\nWater pass through it. For a concave Sphere of Gold filled with Water,\r\nand solder'd up, has, upon pressing the Sphere with great force, let the\r\nWater squeeze through it, and stand all over its outside in multitudes\r\nof small Drops, like Dew, without bursting or cracking the Body of the\r\nGold, as I have been inform'd by an Eye witness. From all which we may\r\nconclude, that Gold has more Pores than solid parts, and by consequence\r\nthat Water has above forty times more Pores than Parts. And he that\r\nshall find out an Hypothesis, by which Water may be so rare, and yet not\r\nbe capable of compression by force, may doubtless by the same Hypothesis\r\nmake Gold, and Water, and all other Bodies, as much rarer as he pleases;\r\nso that Light may find a ready passage through transparent Substances.\r\n\r\nThe Magnet acts upon Iron through all dense Bodies not magnetick nor red\r\nhot, without any diminution of its Virtue; as for instance, through\r\nGold, Silver, Lead, Glass, Water. The gravitating Power of the Sun is\r\ntransmitted through the vast Bodies of the Planets without any\r\ndiminution, so as to act upon all their parts to their very centers\r\nwith the same Force and according to the same Laws, as if the part upon\r\nwhich it acts were not surrounded with the Body of the Planet, The Rays\r\nof Light, whether they be very small Bodies projected, or only Motion or\r\nForce propagated, are moved in right Lines; and whenever a Ray of Light\r\nis by any Obstacle turned out of its rectilinear way, it will never\r\nreturn into the same rectilinear way, unless perhaps by very great\r\naccident. And yet Light is transmitted through pellucid solid Bodies in\r\nright Lines to very great distances. How Bodies can have a sufficient\r\nquantity of Pores for producing these Effects is very difficult to\r\nconceive, but perhaps not altogether impossible. For the Colours of\r\nBodies arise from the Magnitudes of the Particles which reflect them, as\r\nwas explained above. Now if we conceive these Particles of Bodies to be\r\nso disposed amongst themselves, that the Intervals or empty Spaces\r\nbetween them may be equal in magnitude to them all; and that these\r\nParticles may be composed of other Particles much smaller, which have as\r\nmuch empty Space between them as equals all the Magnitudes of these\r\nsmaller Particles: And that in like manner these smaller Particles are\r\nagain composed of others much smaller, all which together are equal to\r\nall the Pores or empty Spaces between them; and so on perpetually till\r\nyou come to solid Particles, such as have no Pores or empty Spaces\r\nwithin them: And if in any gross Body there be, for instance, three such\r\ndegrees of Particles, the least of which are solid; this Body will have\r\nseven times more Pores than solid Parts. But if there be four such\r\ndegrees of Particles, the least of which are solid, the Body will have\r\nfifteen times more Pores than solid Parts. If there be five degrees, the\r\nBody will have one and thirty times more Pores than solid Parts. If six\r\ndegrees, the Body will have sixty and three times more Pores than solid\r\nParts. And so on perpetually. And there are other ways of conceiving how\r\nBodies may be exceeding porous. But what is really their inward Frame is\r\nnot yet known to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. IX.\r\n\r\n_Bodies reflect and refract Light by one and the same power, variously\r\nexercised in various Circumstances._\r\n\r\nThis appears by several Considerations. First, Because when Light goes\r\nout of Glass into Air, as obliquely as it can possibly do. If its\r\nIncidence be made still more oblique, it becomes totally reflected. For\r\nthe power of the Glass after it has refracted the Light as obliquely as\r\nis possible, if the Incidence be still made more oblique, becomes too\r\nstrong to let any of its Rays go through, and by consequence causes\r\ntotal Reflexions. Secondly, Because Light is alternately reflected and\r\ntransmitted by thin Plates of Glass for many Successions, accordingly as\r\nthe thickness of the Plate increases in an arithmetical Progression. For\r\nhere the thickness of the Glass determines whether that Power by which\r\nGlass acts upon Light shall cause it to be reflected, or suffer it to\r\nbe transmitted. And, Thirdly, because those Surfaces of transparent\r\nBodies which have the greatest refracting power, reflect the greatest\r\nquantity of Light, as was shewn in the first Proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. X.\r\n\r\n_If Light be swifter in Bodies than in Vacuo, in the proportion of the\r\nSines which measure the Refraction of the Bodies, the Forces of the\r\nBodies to reflect and refract Light, are very nearly proportional to the\r\ndensities of the same Bodies; excepting that unctuous and sulphureous\r\nBodies refract more than others of this same density._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nLet AB represent the refracting plane Surface of any Body, and IC a Ray\r\nincident very obliquely upon the Body in C, so that the Angle ACI may be\r\ninfinitely little, and let CR be the refracted Ray. From a given Point B\r\nperpendicular to the refracting Surface erect BR meeting with the\r\nrefracting Ray CR in R, and if CR represent the Motion of the refracted\r\nRay, and this Motion be distinguish'd into two Motions CB and BR,\r\nwhereof CB is parallel to the refracting Plane, and BR perpendicular to\r\nit: CB shall represent the Motion of the incident Ray, and BR the\r\nMotion generated by the Refraction, as Opticians have of late explain'd.\r\n\r\nNow if any Body or Thing, in moving through any Space of a given breadth\r\nterminated on both sides by two parallel Planes, be urged forward in all\r\nparts of that Space by Forces tending directly forwards towards the last\r\nPlane, and before its Incidence on the first Plane, had no Motion\r\ntowards it, or but an infinitely little one; and if the Forces in all\r\nparts of that Space, between the Planes, be at equal distances from the\r\nPlanes equal to one another, but at several distances be bigger or less\r\nin any given Proportion, the Motion generated by the Forces in the whole\r\npassage of the Body or thing through that Space shall be in a\r\nsubduplicate Proportion of the Forces, as Mathematicians will easily\r\nunderstand. And therefore, if the Space of activity of the refracting\r\nSuperficies of the Body be consider'd as such a Space, the Motion of the\r\nRay generated by the refracting Force of the Body, during its passage\r\nthrough that Space, that is, the Motion BR, must be in subduplicate\r\nProportion of that refracting Force. I say therefore, that the Square of\r\nthe Line BR, and by consequence the refracting Force of the Body, is\r\nvery nearly as the density of the same Body. For this will appear by the\r\nfollowing Table, wherein the Proportion of the Sines which measure the\r\nRefractions of several Bodies, the Square of BR, supposing CB an unite,\r\nthe Densities of the Bodies estimated by their Specifick Gravities, and\r\ntheir Refractive Power in respect of their Densities are set down in\r\nseveral Columns.\r\n\r\n---------------------+----------------+----------------+----------+-----------\r\n                     |                |                |          |\r\n                     |                | The Square     | The      | The\r\n                     |                | of BR, to      | density  | refractive\r\n                     | The Proportion | which the      | and      | Power of\r\n                     | of the Sines of| refracting     | specifick| the Body\r\n                     | Incidence and  | force of the   | gravity  | in respect\r\n   The refracting    | Refraction of  | Body is        | of the   | of its\r\n      Bodies.        | yellow Light.  | proportionate. | Body.    | density.\r\n---------------------+----------------+----------------+----------+-----------\r\nA Pseudo-Topazius,   |                |                |          |\r\n  being a natural,   |                |                |          |\r\n  pellucid, brittle, |   23 to   14   |    1'699       |  4'27    |   3979\r\n  hairy Stone, of a  |                |                |          |\r\n  yellow Colour.     |                |                |          |\r\nAir.                 | 3201 to 3200   |    0'000625    |  0'0012  |   5208\r\nGlass of Antimony.   |   17 to    9   |    2'568       |  5'28    |   4864\r\nA Selenitis.         |   61 to   41   |    1'213       |  2'252   |   5386\r\nGlass vulgar.        |   31 to   20   |    1'4025      |  2'58    |   5436\r\nCrystal of the Rock. |   25 to   16   |    1'445       |  2'65    |   5450\r\nIsland Crystal.      |    5 to    3   |    1'778       |  2'72    |   6536\r\nSal Gemmae.           |   17 to   11   |    1'388       |  2'143   |   6477\r\nAlume.               |   35 to   24   |    1'1267      |  1'714   |   6570\r\nBorax.               |   22 to   15   |    1'1511      |  1'714   |   6716\r\nNiter.               |   32 to   21   |    1'345       |  1'9     |   7079\r\nDantzick Vitriol.    |  303 to  200   |    1'295       |  1'715   |   7551\r\nOil of Vitriol.      |   10 to    7   |    1'041       |  1'7     |   6124\r\nRain Water.          |  529 to  396   |    0'7845      |  1'      |   7845\r\nGum Arabick.         |   31 to   21   |    1'179       |  1'375   |   8574\r\nSpirit of Wine well  |                |                |          |\r\n  rectified.         |  100 to   73   |    0'8765      |  0'866   |  10121\r\nCamphire.            |    3 to    2   |    1'25        |  0'996   |  12551\r\nOil Olive.           |   22 to   15   |    1'1511      |  0'913   |  12607\r\nLinseed Oil.         |   40 to   27   |    1'1948      |  0'932   |  12819\r\nSpirit of Turpentine.|   25 to   17   |    1'1626      |  0'874   |  13222\r\nAmber.               |   14 to    9   |    1'42        |  1'04    |  13654\r\nA Diamond.           |  100 to   41   |    4'949       |  3'4     |  14556\r\n---------------------+----------------+----------------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\nThe Refraction of the Air in this Table is determin'd by that of the\r\nAtmosphere observed by Astronomers. For, if Light pass through many\r\nrefracting Substances or Mediums gradually denser and denser, and\r\nterminated with parallel Surfaces, the Sum of all the Refractions will\r\nbe equal to the single Refraction which it would have suffer'd in\r\npassing immediately out of the first Medium into the last. And this\r\nholds true, though the Number of the refracting Substances be increased\r\nto Infinity, and the Distances from one another as much decreased, so\r\nthat the Light may be refracted in every Point of its Passage, and by\r\ncontinual Refractions bent into a Curve-Line. And therefore the whole\r\nRefraction of Light in passing through the Atmosphere from the highest\r\nand rarest Part thereof down to the lowest and densest Part, must be\r\nequal to the Refraction which it would suffer in passing at like\r\nObliquity out of a Vacuum immediately into Air of equal Density with\r\nthat in the lowest Part of the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNow, although a Pseudo-Topaz, a Selenitis, Rock Crystal, Island Crystal,\r\nVulgar Glass (that is, Sand melted together) and Glass of Antimony,\r\nwhich are terrestrial stony alcalizate Concretes, and Air which probably\r\narises from such Substances by Fermentation, be Substances very\r\ndiffering from one another in Density, yet by this Table, they have\r\ntheir refractive Powers almost in the same Proportion to one another as\r\ntheir Densities are, excepting that the Refraction of that strange\r\nSubstance, Island Crystal is a little bigger than the rest. And\r\nparticularly Air, which is 3500 Times rarer than the Pseudo-Topaz, and\r\n4400 Times rarer than Glass of Antimony, and 2000 Times rarer than the\r\nSelenitis, Glass vulgar, or Crystal of the Rock, has notwithstanding its\r\nrarity the same refractive Power in respect of its Density which those\r\nvery dense Substances have in respect of theirs, excepting so far as\r\nthose differ from one another.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Refraction of Camphire, Oil Olive, Linseed Oil, Spirit of\r\nTurpentine and Amber, which are fat sulphureous unctuous Bodies, and a\r\nDiamond, which probably is an unctuous Substance coagulated, have their\r\nrefractive Powers in Proportion to one another as their Densities\r\nwithout any considerable Variation. But the refractive Powers of these\r\nunctuous Substances are two or three Times greater in respect of their\r\nDensities than the refractive Powers of the former Substances in respect\r\nof theirs.\r\n\r\nWater has a refractive Power in a middle degree between those two sorts\r\nof Substances, and probably is of a middle nature. For out of it grow\r\nall vegetable and animal Substances, which consist as well of\r\nsulphureous fat and inflamable Parts, as of earthy lean and alcalizate\r\nones.\r\n\r\nSalts and Vitriols have refractive Powers in a middle degree between\r\nthose of earthy Substances and Water, and accordingly are composed of\r\nthose two sorts of Substances. For by distillation and rectification of\r\ntheir Spirits a great Part of them goes into Water, and a great Part\r\nremains behind in the form of a dry fix'd Earth capable of\r\nVitrification.\r\n\r\nSpirit of Wine has a refractive Power in a middle degree between those\r\nof Water and oily Substances, and accordingly seems to be composed of\r\nboth, united by Fermentation; the Water, by means of some saline Spirits\r\nwith which 'tis impregnated, dissolving the Oil, and volatizing it by\r\nthe Action. For Spirit of Wine is inflamable by means of its oily Parts,\r\nand being distilled often from Salt of Tartar, grow by every\r\ndistillation more and more aqueous and phlegmatick. And Chymists\r\nobserve, that Vegetables (as Lavender, Rue, Marjoram, &c.) distilled\r\n_per se_, before fermentation yield Oils without any burning Spirits,\r\nbut after fermentation yield ardent Spirits without Oils: Which shews,\r\nthat their Oil is by fermentation converted into Spirit. They find also,\r\nthat if Oils be poured in a small quantity upon fermentating Vegetables,\r\nthey distil over after fermentation in the form of Spirits.\r\n\r\nSo then, by the foregoing Table, all Bodies seem to have their\r\nrefractive Powers proportional to their Densities, (or very nearly;)\r\nexcepting so far as they partake more or less of sulphureous oily\r\nParticles, and thereby have their refractive Power made greater or less.\r\nWhence it seems rational to attribute the refractive Power of all Bodies\r\nchiefly, if not wholly, to the sulphureous Parts with which they abound.\r\nFor it's probable that all Bodies abound more or less with Sulphurs. And\r\nas Light congregated by a Burning-glass acts most upon sulphureous\r\nBodies, to turn them into Fire and Flame; so, since all Action is\r\nmutual, Sulphurs ought to act most upon Light. For that the action\r\nbetween Light and Bodies is mutual, may appear from this Consideration;\r\nThat the densest Bodies which refract and reflect Light most strongly,\r\ngrow hottest in the Summer Sun, by the action of the refracted or\r\nreflected Light.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto explain'd the power of Bodies to reflect and refract,\r\nand shew'd, that thin transparent Plates, Fibres, and Particles, do,\r\naccording to their several thicknesses and densities, reflect several\r\nsorts of Rays, and thereby appear of several Colours; and by consequence\r\nthat nothing more is requisite for producing all the Colours of natural\r\nBodies, than the several sizes and densities of their transparent\r\nParticles. But whence it is that these Plates, Fibres, and Particles,\r\ndo, according to their several thicknesses and densities, reflect\r\nseveral sorts of Rays, I have not yet explain'd. To give some insight\r\ninto this matter, and make way for understanding the next part of this\r\nBook, I shall conclude this part with a few more Propositions. Those\r\nwhich preceded respect the nature of Bodies, these the nature of Light:\r\nFor both must be understood, before the reason of their Actions upon one\r\nanother can be known. And because the last Proposition depended upon the\r\nvelocity of Light, I will begin with a Proposition of that kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XI.\r\n\r\n_Light is propagated from luminous Bodies in time, and spends about\r\nseven or eight Minutes of an Hour in passing from the Sun to the Earth._\r\n\r\nThis was observed first by _Roemer_, and then by others, by means of the\r\nEclipses of the Satellites of _Jupiter_. For these Eclipses, when the\r\nEarth is between the Sun and _Jupiter_, happen about seven or eight\r\nMinutes sooner than they ought to do by the Tables, and when the Earth\r\nis beyond the Sun they happen about seven or eight Minutes later than\r\nthey ought to do; the reason being, that the Light of the Satellites has\r\nfarther to go in the latter case than in the former by the Diameter of\r\nthe Earth's Orbit. Some inequalities of time may arise from the\r\nExcentricities of the Orbs of the Satellites; but those cannot answer in\r\nall the Satellites, and at all times to the Position and Distance of the\r\nEarth from the Sun. The mean motions of _Jupiter_'s Satellites is also\r\nswifter in his descent from his Aphelium to his Perihelium, than in his\r\nascent in the other half of his Orb. But this inequality has no respect\r\nto the position of the Earth, and in the three interior Satellites is\r\ninsensible, as I find by computation from the Theory of their Gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XII.\r\n\r\n_Every Ray of Light in its passage through any refracting Surface is put\r\ninto a certain transient Constitution or State, which in the progress of\r\nthe Ray returns at equal Intervals, and disposes the Ray at every return\r\nto be easily transmitted through the next refracting Surface, and\r\nbetween the returns to be easily reflected by it._\r\n\r\nThis is manifest by the 5th, 9th, 12th, and 15th Observations. For by\r\nthose Observations it appears, that one and the same sort of Rays at\r\nequal Angles of Incidence on any thin transparent Plate, is alternately\r\nreflected and transmitted for many Successions accordingly as the\r\nthickness of the Plate increases in arithmetical Progression of the\r\nNumbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &c. so that if the first Reflexion\r\n(that which makes the first or innermost of the Rings of Colours there\r\ndescribed) be made at the thickness 1, the Rays shall be transmitted at\r\nthe thicknesses 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, &c. and thereby make the central\r\nSpot and Rings of Light, which appear by transmission, and be reflected\r\nat the thickness 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. and thereby make the Rings which\r\nappear by Reflexion. And this alternate Reflexion and Transmission, as I\r\ngather by the 24th Observation, continues for above an hundred\r\nvicissitudes, and by the Observations in the next part of this Book, for\r\nmany thousands, being propagated from one Surface of a Glass Plate to\r\nthe other, though the thickness of the Plate be a quarter of an Inch or\r\nabove: So that this alternation seems to be propagated from every\r\nrefracting Surface to all distances without end or limitation.\r\n\r\nThis alternate Reflexion and Refraction depends on both the Surfaces of\r\nevery thin Plate, because it depends on their distance. By the 21st\r\nObservation, if either Surface of a thin Plate of _Muscovy_ Glass be\r\nwetted, the Colours caused by the alternate Reflexion and Refraction\r\ngrow faint, and therefore it depends on them both.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore perform'd at the second Surface; for if it were\r\nperform'd at the first, before the Rays arrive at the second, it would\r\nnot depend on the second.\r\n\r\nIt is also influenced by some action or disposition, propagated from the\r\nfirst to the second, because otherwise at the second it would not depend\r\non the first. And this action or disposition, in its propagation,\r\nintermits and returns by equal Intervals, because in all its progress it\r\ninclines the Ray at one distance from the first Surface to be reflected\r\nby the second, at another to be transmitted by it, and that by equal\r\nIntervals for innumerable vicissitudes. And because the Ray is disposed\r\nto Reflexion at the distances 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. and to Transmission at\r\nthe distances 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c. (for its transmission through the\r\nfirst Surface, is at the distance 0, and it is transmitted through both\r\ntogether, if their distance be infinitely little or much less than 1)\r\nthe disposition to be transmitted at the distances 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c.\r\nis to be accounted a return of the same disposition which the Ray first\r\nhad at the distance 0, that is at its transmission through the first\r\nrefracting Surface. All which is the thing I would prove.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of action or disposition this is; Whether it consists in a\r\ncirculating or a vibrating motion of the Ray, or of the Medium, or\r\nsomething else, I do not here enquire. Those that are averse from\r\nassenting to any new Discoveries, but such as they can explain by an\r\nHypothesis, may for the present suppose, that as Stones by falling upon\r\nWater put the Water into an undulating Motion, and all Bodies by\r\npercussion excite vibrations in the Air; so the Rays of Light, by\r\nimpinging on any refracting or reflecting Surface, excite vibrations in\r\nthe refracting or reflecting Medium or Substance, and by exciting them\r\nagitate the solid parts of the refracting or reflecting Body, and by\r\nagitating them cause the Body to grow warm or hot; that the vibrations\r\nthus excited are propagated in the refracting or reflecting Medium or\r\nSubstance, much after the manner that vibrations are propagated in the\r\nAir for causing Sound, and move faster than the Rays so as to overtake\r\nthem; and that when any Ray is in that part of the vibration which\r\nconspires with its Motion, it easily breaks through a refracting\r\nSurface, but when it is in the contrary part of the vibration which\r\nimpedes its Motion, it is easily reflected; and, by consequence, that\r\nevery Ray is successively disposed to be easily reflected, or easily\r\ntransmitted, by every vibration which overtakes it. But whether this\r\nHypothesis be true or false I do not here consider. I content my self\r\nwith the bare Discovery, that the Rays of Light are by some cause or\r\nother alternately disposed to be reflected or refracted for many\r\nvicissitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.\r\n\r\n_The returns of the disposition of any Ray to be reflected I will call\r\nits_ Fits of easy Reflexion, _and those of its disposition to be\r\ntransmitted its_ Fits of easy Transmission, _and the space it passes\r\nbetween every return and the next return, the_ Interval of its Fits.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XIII.\r\n\r\n_The reason why the Surfaces of all thick transparent Bodies reflect\r\npart of the Light incident on them, and refract the rest, is, that some\r\nRays at their Incidence are in Fits of easy Reflexion, and others in\r\nFits of easy Transmission._\r\n\r\nThis may be gather'd from the 24th Observation, where the Light\r\nreflected by thin Plates of Air and Glass, which to the naked Eye\r\nappear'd evenly white all over the Plate, did through a Prism appear\r\nwaved with many Successions of Light and Darkness made by alternate Fits\r\nof easy Reflexion and easy Transmission, the Prism severing and\r\ndistinguishing the Waves of which the white reflected Light was\r\ncomposed, as was explain'd above.\r\n\r\nAnd hence Light is in Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission,\r\nbefore its Incidence on transparent Bodies. And probably it is put into\r\nsuch fits at its first emission from luminous Bodies, and continues in\r\nthem during all its progress. For these Fits are of a lasting nature, as\r\nwill appear by the next part of this Book.\r\n\r\nIn this Proposition I suppose the transparent Bodies to be thick;\r\nbecause if the thickness of the Body be much less than the Interval of\r\nthe Fits of easy Reflexion and Transmission of the Rays, the Body loseth\r\nits reflecting power. For if the Rays, which at their entering into the\r\nBody are put into Fits of easy Transmission, arrive at the farthest\r\nSurface of the Body before they be out of those Fits, they must be\r\ntransmitted. And this is the reason why Bubbles of Water lose their\r\nreflecting power when they grow very thin; and why all opake Bodies,\r\nwhen reduced into very small parts, become transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XIV.\r\n\r\n_Those Surfaces of transparent Bodies, which if the Ray be in a Fit of\r\nRefraction do refract it most strongly, if the Ray be in a Fit of\r\nReflexion do reflect it most easily._\r\n\r\nFor we shewed above, in _Prop._ 8. that the cause of Reflexion is not\r\nthe impinging of Light on the solid impervious parts of Bodies, but some\r\nother power by which those solid parts act on Light at a distance. We\r\nshewed also in _Prop._ 9. that Bodies reflect and refract Light by one\r\nand the same power, variously exercised in various circumstances; and in\r\n_Prop._ 1. that the most strongly refracting Surfaces reflect the most\r\nLight: All which compared together evince and rarify both this and the\r\nlast Proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XV.\r\n\r\n_In any one and the same sort of Rays, emerging in any Angle out of any\r\nrefracting Surface into one and the same Medium, the Interval of the\r\nfollowing Fits of easy Reflexion and Transmission are either accurately\r\nor very nearly, as the Rectangle of the Secant of the Angle of\r\nRefraction, and of the Secant of another Angle, whose Sine is the first\r\nof 106 arithmetical mean Proportionals, between the Sines of Incidence\r\nand Refraction, counted from the Sine of Refraction._\r\n\r\nThis is manifest by the 7th and 19th Observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XVI.\r\n\r\n_In several sorts of Rays emerging in equal Angles out of any refracting\r\nSurface into the same Medium, the Intervals of the following Fits of\r\neasy Reflexion and easy Transmission are either accurately, or very\r\nnearly, as the Cube-Roots of the Squares of the lengths of a Chord,\r\nwhich found the Notes in an Eight_, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol,\r\n_with all their intermediate degrees answering to the Colours of those\r\nRays, according to the Analogy described in the seventh Experiment of\r\nthe second Part of the first Book._\r\n\r\nThis is manifest by the 13th and 14th Observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XVII.\r\n\r\n_If Rays of any sort pass perpendicularly into several Mediums, the\r\nIntervals of the Fits of easy Reflexion and Transmission in any one\r\nMedium, are to those Intervals in any other, as the Sine of Incidence to\r\nthe Sine of Refraction, when the Rays pass out of the first of those two\r\nMediums into the second._\r\n\r\nThis is manifest by the 10th Observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XVIII.\r\n\r\n_If the Rays which paint the Colour in the Confine of yellow and orange\r\npass perpendicularly out of any Medium into Air, the Intervals of their\r\nFits of easy Reflexion are the 1/89000th part of an Inch. And of the\r\nsame length are the Intervals of their Fits of easy Transmission._\r\n\r\nThis is manifest by the 6th Observation. From these Propositions it is\r\neasy to collect the Intervals of the Fits of easy Reflexion and easy\r\nTransmission of any sort of Rays refracted in any angle into any Medium;\r\nand thence to know, whether the Rays shall be reflected or transmitted\r\nat their subsequent Incidence upon any other pellucid Medium. Which\r\nthing, being useful for understanding the next part of this Book, was\r\nhere to be set down. And for the same reason I add the two following\r\nPropositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XIX.\r\n\r\n_If any sort of Rays falling on the polite Surface of any pellucid\r\nMedium be reflected back, the Fits of easy Reflexion, which they have at\r\nthe point of Reflexion, shall still continue to return; and the Returns\r\nshall be at distances from the point of Reflexion in the arithmetical\r\nprogression of the Numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, &c. and between these\r\nFits the Rays shall be in Fits of easy Transmission._\r\n\r\nFor since the Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission are of a\r\nreturning nature, there is no reason why these Fits, which continued\r\ntill the Ray arrived at the reflecting Medium, and there inclined the\r\nRay to Reflexion, should there cease. And if the Ray at the point of\r\nReflexion was in a Fit of easy Reflexion, the progression of the\r\ndistances of these Fits from that point must begin from 0, and so be of\r\nthe Numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. And therefore the progression of the\r\ndistances of the intermediate Fits of easy Transmission, reckon'd from\r\nthe same point, must be in the progression of the odd Numbers 1, 3, 5,\r\n7, 9, &c. contrary to what happens when the Fits are propagated from\r\npoints of Refraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROP. XX.\r\n\r\n_The Intervals of the Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission,\r\npropagated from points of Reflexion into any Medium, are equal to the\r\nIntervals of the like Fits, which the same Rays would have, if refracted\r\ninto the same Medium in Angles of Refraction equal to their Angles of\r\nReflexion._\r\n\r\nFor when Light is reflected by the second Surface of thin Plates, it\r\ngoes out afterwards freely at the first Surface to make the Rings of\r\nColours which appear by Reflexion; and, by the freedom of its egress,\r\nmakes the Colours of these Rings more vivid and strong than those which\r\nappear on the other side of the Plates by the transmitted Light. The\r\nreflected Rays are therefore in Fits of easy Transmission at their\r\negress; which would not always happen, if the Intervals of the Fits\r\nwithin the Plate after Reflexion were not equal, both in length and\r\nnumber, to their Intervals before it. And this confirms also the\r\nproportions set down in the former Proposition. For if the Rays both in\r\ngoing in and out at the first Surface be in Fits of easy Transmission,\r\nand the Intervals and Numbers of those Fits between the first and second\r\nSurface, before and after Reflexion, be equal, the distances of the Fits\r\nof easy Transmission from either Surface, must be in the same\r\nprogression after Reflexion as before; that is, from the first Surface\r\nwhich transmitted them in the progression of the even Numbers 0, 2, 4,\r\n6, 8, &c. and from the second which reflected them, in that of the odd\r\nNumbers 1, 3, 5, 7, &c. But these two Propositions will become much more\r\nevident by the Observations in the following part of this Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nSECOND BOOK\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nOPTICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART IV._\r\n\r\n_Observations concerning the Reflexions and Colours of thick transparent\r\npolish'd Plates._\r\n\r\nThere is no Glass or Speculum how well soever polished, but, besides the\r\nLight which it refracts or reflects regularly, scatters every way\r\nirregularly a faint Light, by means of which the polish'd Surface, when\r\nilluminated in a dark room by a beam of the Sun's Light, may be easily\r\nseen in all positions of the Eye. There are certain Phaenomena of this\r\nscatter'd Light, which when I first observed them, seem'd very strange\r\nand surprizing to me. My Observations were as follows.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 1. The Sun shining into my darken'd Chamber through a hole one\r\nthird of an Inch wide, I let the intromitted beam of Light fall\r\nperpendicularly upon a Glass Speculum ground concave on one side and\r\nconvex on the other, to a Sphere of five Feet and eleven Inches Radius,\r\nand Quick-silver'd over on the convex side. And holding a white opake\r\nChart, or a Quire of Paper at the center of the Spheres to which the\r\nSpeculum was ground, that is, at the distance of about five Feet and\r\neleven Inches from the Speculum, in such manner, that the beam of Light\r\nmight pass through a little hole made in the middle of the Chart to the\r\nSpeculum, and thence be reflected back to the same hole: I observed upon\r\nthe Chart four or five concentric Irises or Rings of Colours, like\r\nRain-bows, encompassing the hole much after the manner that those, which\r\nin the fourth and following Observations of the first part of this Book\r\nappear'd between the Object-glasses, encompassed the black Spot, but yet\r\nlarger and fainter than those. These Rings as they grew larger and\r\nlarger became diluter and fainter, so that the fifth was scarce visible.\r\nYet sometimes, when the Sun shone very clear, there appear'd faint\r\nLineaments of a sixth and seventh. If the distance of the Chart from the\r\nSpeculum was much greater or much less than that of six Feet, the Rings\r\nbecame dilute and vanish'd. And if the distance of the Speculum from the\r\nWindow was much greater than that of six Feet, the reflected beam of\r\nLight would be so broad at the distance of six Feet from the Speculum\r\nwhere the Rings appear'd, as to obscure one or two of the innermost\r\nRings. And therefore I usually placed the Speculum at about six Feet\r\nfrom the Window; so that its Focus might there fall in with the center\r\nof its concavity at the Rings upon the Chart. And this Posture is always\r\nto be understood in the following Observations where no other is\r\nexpress'd.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 2. The Colours of these Rain-bows succeeded one another from the\r\ncenter outwards, in the same form and order with those which were made\r\nin the ninth Observation of the first Part of this Book by Light not\r\nreflected, but transmitted through the two Object-glasses. For, first,\r\nthere was in their common center a white round Spot of faint Light,\r\nsomething broader than the reflected beam of Light, which beam sometimes\r\nfell upon the middle of the Spot, and sometimes by a little inclination\r\nof the Speculum receded from the middle, and left the Spot white to the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nThis white Spot was immediately encompassed with a dark grey or russet,\r\nand that dark grey with the Colours of the first Iris; which Colours on\r\nthe inside next the dark grey were a little violet and indigo, and next\r\nto that a blue, which on the outside grew pale, and then succeeded a\r\nlittle greenish yellow, and after that a brighter yellow, and then on\r\nthe outward edge of the Iris a red which on the outside inclined to\r\npurple.\r\n\r\nThis Iris was immediately encompassed with a second, whose Colours were\r\nin order from the inside outwards, purple, blue, green, yellow, light\r\nred, a red mix'd with purple.\r\n\r\nThen immediately follow'd the Colours of the third Iris, which were in\r\norder outwards a green inclining to purple, a good green, and a red more\r\nbright than that of the former Iris.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and fifth Iris seem'd of a bluish green within, and red\r\nwithout, but so faintly that it was difficult to discern the Colours.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 3. Measuring the Diameters of these Rings upon the Chart as\r\naccurately as I could, I found them also in the same proportion to one\r\nanother with the Rings made by Light transmitted through the two\r\nObject-glasses. For the Diameters of the four first of the bright Rings\r\nmeasured between the brightest parts of their Orbits, at the distance of\r\nsix Feet from the Speculum were 1-11/16, 2-3/8, 2-11/12, 3-3/8 Inches,\r\nwhose Squares are in arithmetical progression of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.\r\nIf the white circular Spot in the middle be reckon'd amongst the Rings,\r\nand its central Light, where it seems to be most luminous, be put\r\nequipollent to an infinitely little Ring; the Squares of the Diameters\r\nof the Rings will be in the progression 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. I measured\r\nalso the Diameters of the dark Circles between these luminous ones, and\r\nfound their Squares in the progression of the numbers 1/2, 1-1/2, 2-1/2,\r\n3-1/2, &c. the Diameters of the first four at the distance of six Feet\r\nfrom the Speculum, being 1-3/16, 2-1/16, 2-2/3, 3-3/20 Inches. If the\r\ndistance of the Chart from the Speculum was increased or diminished, the\r\nDiameters of the Circles were increased or diminished proportionally.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 4. By the analogy between these Rings and those described in the\r\nObservations of the first Part of this Book, I suspected that there\r\nwere many more of them which spread into one another, and by interfering\r\nmix'd their Colours, and diluted one another so that they could not be\r\nseen apart. I viewed them therefore through a Prism, as I did those in\r\nthe 24th Observation of the first Part of this Book. And when the Prism\r\nwas so placed as by refracting the Light of their mix'd Colours to\r\nseparate them, and distinguish the Rings from one another, as it did\r\nthose in that Observation, I could then see them distincter than before,\r\nand easily number eight or nine of them, and sometimes twelve or\r\nthirteen. And had not their Light been so very faint, I question not but\r\nthat I might have seen many more.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 5. Placing a Prism at the Window to refract the intromitted beam\r\nof Light, and cast the oblong Spectrum of Colours on the Speculum: I\r\ncovered the Speculum with a black Paper which had in the middle of it a\r\nhole to let any one of the Colours pass through to the Speculum, whilst\r\nthe rest were intercepted by the Paper. And now I found Rings of that\r\nColour only which fell upon the Speculum. If the Speculum was\r\nilluminated with red, the Rings were totally red with dark Intervals, if\r\nwith blue they were totally blue, and so of the other Colours. And when\r\nthey were illuminated with any one Colour, the Squares of their\r\nDiameters measured between their most luminous Parts, were in the\r\narithmetical Progression of the Numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the Squares\r\nof the Diameters of their dark Intervals in the Progression of the\r\nintermediate Numbers 1/2, 1-1/2, 2-1/2, 3-1/2. But if the Colour was\r\nvaried, they varied their Magnitude. In the red they were largest, in\r\nthe indigo and violet least, and in the intermediate Colours yellow,\r\ngreen, and blue, they were of several intermediate Bignesses answering\r\nto the Colour, that is, greater in yellow than in green, and greater in\r\ngreen than in blue. And hence I knew, that when the Speculum was\r\nilluminated with white Light, the red and yellow on the outside of the\r\nRings were produced by the least refrangible Rays, and the blue and\r\nviolet by the most refrangible, and that the Colours of each Ring spread\r\ninto the Colours of the neighbouring Rings on either side, after the\r\nmanner explain'd in the first and second Part of this Book, and by\r\nmixing diluted one another so that they could not be distinguish'd,\r\nunless near the Center where they were least mix'd. For in this\r\nObservation I could see the Rings more distinctly, and to a greater\r\nNumber than before, being able in the yellow Light to number eight or\r\nnine of them, besides a faint shadow of a tenth. To satisfy my self how\r\nmuch the Colours of the several Rings spread into one another, I\r\nmeasured the Diameters of the second and third Rings, and found them\r\nwhen made by the Confine of the red and orange to be to the same\r\nDiameters when made by the Confine of blue and indigo, as 9 to 8, or\r\nthereabouts. For it was hard to determine this Proportion accurately.\r\nAlso the Circles made successively by the red, yellow, and green,\r\ndiffer'd more from one another than those made successively by the\r\ngreen, blue, and indigo. For the Circle made by the violet was too dark\r\nto be seen. To carry on the Computation, let us therefore suppose that\r\nthe Differences of the Diameters of the Circles made by the outmost red,\r\nthe Confine of red and orange, the Confine of orange and yellow, the\r\nConfine of yellow and green, the Confine of green and blue, the Confine\r\nof blue and indigo, the Confine of indigo and violet, and outmost\r\nviolet, are in proportion as the Differences of the Lengths of a\r\nMonochord which sound the Tones in an Eight; _sol_, _la_, _fa_, _sol_,\r\n_la_, _mi_, _fa_, _sol_, that is, as the Numbers 1/9, 1/18, 1/12, 1/12,\r\n2/27, 1/27, 1/18. And if the Diameter of the Circle made by the Confine\r\nof red and orange be 9A, and that of the Circle made by the Confine of\r\nblue and indigo be 8A as above; their difference 9A-8A will be to the\r\ndifference of the Diameters of the Circles made by the outmost red, and\r\nby the Confine of red and orange, as 1/18 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 2/27 to 1/9,\r\nthat is as 8/27 to 1/9, or 8 to 3, and to the difference of the Circles\r\nmade by the outmost violet, and by the Confine of blue and indigo, as\r\n1/18 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 2/27 to 1/27 + 1/18, that is, as 8/27 to 5/54, or\r\nas 16 to 5. And therefore these differences will be 3/8A and 5/16A. Add\r\nthe first to 9A and subduct the last from 8A, and you will have the\r\nDiameters of the Circles made by the least and most refrangible Rays\r\n75/8A and ((61-1/2)/8)A. These diameters are therefore to one another as\r\n75 to 61-1/2 or 50 to 41, and their Squares as 2500 to 1681, that is, as\r\n3 to 2 very nearly. Which proportion differs not much from the\r\nproportion of the Diameters of the Circles made by the outmost red and\r\noutmost violet, in the 13th Observation of the first part of this Book.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 6. Placing my Eye where these Rings appear'd plainest, I saw the\r\nSpeculum tinged all over with Waves of Colours, (red, yellow, green,\r\nblue;) like those which in the Observations of the first part of this\r\nBook appeared between the Object-glasses, and upon Bubbles of Water, but\r\nmuch larger. And after the manner of those, they were of various\r\nmagnitudes in various Positions of the Eye, swelling and shrinking as I\r\nmoved my Eye this way and that way. They were formed like Arcs of\r\nconcentrick Circles, as those were; and when my Eye was over against the\r\ncenter of the concavity of the Speculum, (that is, 5 Feet and 10 Inches\r\ndistant from the Speculum,) their common center was in a right Line with\r\nthat center of concavity, and with the hole in the Window. But in other\r\npostures of my Eye their center had other positions. They appear'd by\r\nthe Light of the Clouds propagated to the Speculum through the hole in\r\nthe Window; and when the Sun shone through that hole upon the Speculum,\r\nhis Light upon it was of the Colour of the Ring whereon it fell, but by\r\nits splendor obscured the Rings made by the Light of the Clouds, unless\r\nwhen the Speculum was removed to a great distance from the Window, so\r\nthat his Light upon it might be broad and faint. By varying the position\r\nof my Eye, and moving it nearer to or farther from the direct beam of\r\nthe Sun's Light, the Colour of the Sun's reflected Light constantly\r\nvaried upon the Speculum, as it did upon my Eye, the same Colour always\r\nappearing to a Bystander upon my Eye which to me appear'd upon the\r\nSpeculum. And thence I knew that the Rings of Colours upon the Chart\r\nwere made by these reflected Colours, propagated thither from the\r\nSpeculum in several Angles, and that their production depended not upon\r\nthe termination of Light and Shadow.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 7. By the Analogy of all these Phaenomena with those of the like\r\nRings of Colours described in the first part of this Book, it seemed to\r\nme that these Colours were produced by this thick Plate of Glass, much\r\nafter the manner that those were produced by very thin Plates. For, upon\r\ntrial, I found that if the Quick-silver were rubb'd off from the\r\nbackside of the Speculum, the Glass alone would cause the same Rings of\r\nColours, but much more faint than before; and therefore the Phaenomenon\r\ndepends not upon the Quick-silver, unless so far as the Quick-silver by\r\nincreasing the Reflexion of the backside of the Glass increases the\r\nLight of the Rings of Colours. I found also that a Speculum of Metal\r\nwithout Glass made some Years since for optical uses, and very well\r\nwrought, produced none of those Rings; and thence I understood that\r\nthese Rings arise not from one specular Surface alone, but depend upon\r\nthe two Surfaces of the Plate of Glass whereof the Speculum was made,\r\nand upon the thickness of the Glass between them. For as in the 7th and\r\n19th Observations of the first part of this Book a thin Plate of Air,\r\nWater, or Glass of an even thickness appeared of one Colour when the\r\nRays were perpendicular to it, of another when they were a little\r\noblique, of another when more oblique, of another when still more\r\noblique, and so on; so here, in the sixth Observation, the Light which\r\nemerged out of the Glass in several Obliquities, made the Glass appear\r\nof several Colours, and being propagated in those Obliquities to the\r\nChart, there painted Rings of those Colours. And as the reason why a\r\nthin Plate appeared of several Colours in several Obliquities of the\r\nRays, was, that the Rays of one and the same sort are reflected by the\r\nthin Plate at one obliquity and transmitted at another, and those of\r\nother sorts transmitted where these are reflected, and reflected where\r\nthese are transmitted: So the reason why the thick Plate of Glass\r\nwhereof the Speculum was made did appear of various Colours in various\r\nObliquities, and in those Obliquities propagated those Colours to the\r\nChart, was, that the Rays of one and the same sort did at one Obliquity\r\nemerge out of the Glass, at another did not emerge, but were reflected\r\nback towards the Quick-silver by the hither Surface of the Glass, and\r\naccordingly as the Obliquity became greater and greater, emerged and\r\nwere reflected alternately for many Successions; and that in one and the\r\nsame Obliquity the Rays of one sort were reflected, and those of another\r\ntransmitted. This is manifest by the fifth Observation of this part of\r\nthis Book. For in that Observation, when the Speculum was illuminated by\r\nany one of the prismatick Colours, that Light made many Rings of the\r\nsame Colour upon the Chart with dark Intervals, and therefore at its\r\nemergence out of the Speculum was alternately transmitted and not\r\ntransmitted from the Speculum to the Chart for many Successions,\r\naccording to the various Obliquities of its Emergence. And when the\r\nColour cast on the Speculum by the Prism was varied, the Rings became of\r\nthe Colour cast on it, and varied their bigness with their Colour, and\r\ntherefore the Light was now alternately transmitted and not transmitted\r\nfrom the Speculum to the Chart at other Obliquities than before. It\r\nseemed to me therefore that these Rings were of one and the same\r\noriginal with those of thin Plates, but yet with this difference, that\r\nthose of thin Plates are made by the alternate Reflexions and\r\nTransmissions of the Rays at the second Surface of the Plate, after one\r\npassage through it; but here the Rays go twice through the Plate before\r\nthey are alternately reflected and transmitted. First, they go through\r\nit from the first Surface to the Quick-silver, and then return through\r\nit from the Quick-silver to the first Surface, and there are either\r\ntransmitted to the Chart or reflected back to the Quick-silver,\r\naccordingly as they are in their Fits of easy Reflexion or Transmission\r\nwhen they arrive at that Surface. For the Intervals of the Fits of the\r\nRays which fall perpendicularly on the Speculum, and are reflected back\r\nin the same perpendicular Lines, by reason of the equality of these\r\nAngles and Lines, are of the same length and number within the Glass\r\nafter Reflexion as before, by the 19th Proposition of the third part of\r\nthis Book. And therefore since all the Rays that enter through the\r\nfirst Surface are in their Fits of easy Transmission at their entrance,\r\nand as many of these as are reflected by the second are in their Fits of\r\neasy Reflexion there, all these must be again in their Fits of easy\r\nTransmission at their return to the first, and by consequence there go\r\nout of the Glass to the Chart, and form upon it the white Spot of Light\r\nin the center of the Rings. For the reason holds good in all sorts of\r\nRays, and therefore all sorts must go out promiscuously to that Spot,\r\nand by their mixture cause it to be white. But the Intervals of the Fits\r\nof those Rays which are reflected more obliquely than they enter, must\r\nbe greater after Reflexion than before, by the 15th and 20th\r\nPropositions. And thence it may happen that the Rays at their return to\r\nthe first Surface, may in certain Obliquities be in Fits of easy\r\nReflexion, and return back to the Quick-silver, and in other\r\nintermediate Obliquities be again in Fits of easy Transmission, and so\r\ngo out to the Chart, and paint on it the Rings of Colours about the\r\nwhite Spot. And because the Intervals of the Fits at equal obliquities\r\nare greater and fewer in the less refrangible Rays, and less and more\r\nnumerous in the more refrangible, therefore the less refrangible at\r\nequal obliquities shall make fewer Rings than the more refrangible, and\r\nthe Rings made by those shall be larger than the like number of Rings\r\nmade by these; that is, the red Rings shall be larger than the yellow,\r\nthe yellow than the green, the green than the blue, and the blue than\r\nthe violet, as they were really found to be in the fifth Observation.\r\nAnd therefore the first Ring of all Colours encompassing the white Spot\r\nof Light shall be red without any violet within, and yellow, and green,\r\nand blue in the middle, as it was found in the second Observation; and\r\nthese Colours in the second Ring, and those that follow, shall be more\r\nexpanded, till they spread into one another, and blend one another by\r\ninterfering.\r\n\r\nThese seem to be the reasons of these Rings in general; and this put me\r\nupon observing the thickness of the Glass, and considering whether the\r\ndimensions and proportions of the Rings may be truly derived from it by\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 8. I measured therefore the thickness of this concavo-convex\r\nPlate of Glass, and found it every where 1/4 of an Inch precisely. Now,\r\nby the sixth Observation of the first Part of this Book, a thin Plate of\r\nAir transmits the brightest Light of the first Ring, that is, the bright\r\nyellow, when its thickness is the 1/89000th part of an Inch; and by the\r\ntenth Observation of the same Part, a thin Plate of Glass transmits the\r\nsame Light of the same Ring, when its thickness is less in proportion of\r\nthe Sine of Refraction to the Sine of Incidence, that is, when its\r\nthickness is the 11/1513000th or 1/137545th part of an Inch, supposing\r\nthe Sines are as 11 to 17. And if this thickness be doubled, it\r\ntransmits the same bright Light of the second Ring; if tripled, it\r\ntransmits that of the third, and so on; the bright yellow Light in all\r\nthese cases being in its Fits of Transmission. And therefore if its\r\nthickness be multiplied 34386 times, so as to become 1/4 of an Inch, it\r\ntransmits the same bright Light of the 34386th Ring. Suppose this be the\r\nbright yellow Light transmitted perpendicularly from the reflecting\r\nconvex side of the Glass through the concave side to the white Spot in\r\nthe center of the Rings of Colours on the Chart: And by a Rule in the\r\n7th and 19th Observations in the first Part of this Book, and by the\r\n15th and 20th Propositions of the third Part of this Book, if the Rays\r\nbe made oblique to the Glass, the thickness of the Glass requisite to\r\ntransmit the same bright Light of the same Ring in any obliquity, is to\r\nthis thickness of 1/4 of an Inch, as the Secant of a certain Angle to\r\nthe Radius, the Sine of which Angle is the first of an hundred and six\r\narithmetical Means between the Sines of Incidence and Refraction,\r\ncounted from the Sine of Incidence when the Refraction is made out of\r\nany plated Body into any Medium encompassing it; that is, in this case,\r\nout of Glass into Air. Now if the thickness of the Glass be increased by\r\ndegrees, so as to bear to its first thickness, (_viz._ that of a quarter\r\nof an Inch,) the Proportions which 34386 (the number of Fits of the\r\nperpendicular Rays in going through the Glass towards the white Spot in\r\nthe center of the Rings,) hath to 34385, 34384, 34383, and 34382, (the\r\nnumbers of the Fits of the oblique Rays in going through the Glass\r\ntowards the first, second, third, and fourth Rings of Colours,) and if\r\nthe first thickness be divided into 100000000 equal parts, the increased\r\nthicknesses will be 100002908, 100005816, 100008725, and 100011633, and\r\nthe Angles of which these thicknesses are Secants will be 26' 13'', 37'\r\n5'', 45' 6'', and 52' 26'', the Radius being 100000000; and the Sines of\r\nthese Angles are 762, 1079, 1321, and 1525, and the proportional Sines\r\nof Refraction 1172, 1659, 2031, and 2345, the Radius being 100000. For\r\nsince the Sines of Incidence out of Glass into Air are to the Sines of\r\nRefraction as 11 to 17, and to the above-mentioned Secants as 11 to the\r\nfirst of 106 arithmetical Means between 11 and 17, that is, as 11 to\r\n11-6/106, those Secants will be to the Sines of Refraction as 11-6/106,\r\nto 17, and by this Analogy will give these Sines. So then, if the\r\nobliquities of the Rays to the concave Surface of the Glass be such that\r\nthe Sines of their Refraction in passing out of the Glass through that\r\nSurface into the Air be 1172, 1659, 2031, 2345, the bright Light of the\r\n34386th Ring shall emerge at the thicknesses of the Glass, which are to\r\n1/4 of an Inch as 34386 to 34385, 34384, 34383, 34382, respectively. And\r\ntherefore, if the thickness in all these Cases be 1/4 of an Inch (as it\r\nis in the Glass of which the Speculum was made) the bright Light of the\r\n34385th Ring shall emerge where the Sine of Refraction is 1172, and that\r\nof the 34384th, 34383th, and 34382th Ring where the Sine is 1659, 2031,\r\nand 2345 respectively. And in these Angles of Refraction the Light of\r\nthese Rings shall be propagated from the Speculum to the Chart, and\r\nthere paint Rings about the white central round Spot of Light which we\r\nsaid was the Light of the 34386th Ring. And the Semidiameters of these\r\nRings shall subtend the Angles of Refraction made at the\r\nConcave-Surface of the Speculum, and by consequence their Diameters\r\nshall be to the distance of the Chart from the Speculum as those Sines\r\nof Refraction doubled are to the Radius, that is, as 1172, 1659, 2031,\r\nand 2345, doubled are to 100000. And therefore, if the distance of the\r\nChart from the Concave-Surface of the Speculum be six Feet (as it was in\r\nthe third of these Observations) the Diameters of the Rings of this\r\nbright yellow Light upon the Chart shall be 1'688, 2'389, 2'925, 3'375\r\nInches: For these Diameters are to six Feet, as the above-mention'd\r\nSines doubled are to the Radius. Now, these Diameters of the bright\r\nyellow Rings, thus found by Computation are the very same with those\r\nfound in the third of these Observations by measuring them, _viz._ with\r\n1-11/16, 2-3/8, 2-11/12, and 3-3/8 Inches, and therefore the Theory of\r\nderiving these Rings from the thickness of the Plate of Glass of which\r\nthe Speculum was made, and from the Obliquity of the emerging Rays\r\nagrees with the Observation. In this Computation I have equalled the\r\nDiameters of the bright Rings made by Light of all Colours, to the\r\nDiameters of the Rings made by the bright yellow. For this yellow makes\r\nthe brightest Part of the Rings of all Colours. If you desire the\r\nDiameters of the Rings made by the Light of any other unmix'd Colour,\r\nyou may find them readily by putting them to the Diameters of the bright\r\nyellow ones in a subduplicate Proportion of the Intervals of the Fits of\r\nthe Rays of those Colours when equally inclined to the refracting or\r\nreflecting Surface which caused those Fits, that is, by putting the\r\nDiameters of the Rings made by the Rays in the Extremities and Limits of\r\nthe seven Colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet,\r\nproportional to the Cube-roots of the Numbers, 1, 8/9, 5/6, 3/4, 2/3,\r\n3/5, 9/16, 1/2, which express the Lengths of a Monochord sounding the\r\nNotes in an Eighth: For by this means the Diameters of the Rings of\r\nthese Colours will be found pretty nearly in the same Proportion to one\r\nanother, which they ought to have by the fifth of these Observations.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I satisfy'd my self, that these Rings were of the same kind and\r\nOriginal with those of thin Plates, and by consequence that the Fits or\r\nalternate Dispositions of the Rays to be reflected and transmitted are\r\npropagated to great distances from every reflecting and refracting\r\nSurface. But yet to put the matter out of doubt, I added the following\r\nObservation.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 9. If these Rings thus depend on the thickness of the Plate of\r\nGlass, their Diameters at equal distances from several Speculums made of\r\nsuch concavo-convex Plates of Glass as are ground on the same Sphere,\r\nought to be reciprocally in a subduplicate Proportion of the thicknesses\r\nof the Plates of Glass. And if this Proportion be found true by\r\nexperience it will amount to a demonstration that these Rings (like\r\nthose formed in thin Plates) do depend on the thickness of the Glass. I\r\nprocured therefore another concavo-convex Plate of Glass ground on both\r\nsides to the same Sphere with the former Plate. Its thickness was 5/62\r\nParts of an Inch; and the Diameters of the three first bright Rings\r\nmeasured between the brightest Parts of their Orbits at the distance of\r\nsix Feet from the Glass were 3.4-1/6.5-1/8. Inches. Now, the thickness\r\nof the other Glass being 1/4 of an Inch was to the thickness of this\r\nGlass as 1/4 to 5/62, that is as 31 to 10, or 310000000 to 100000000,\r\nand the Roots of these Numbers are 17607 and 10000, and in the\r\nProportion of the first of these Roots to the second are the Diameters\r\nof the bright Rings made in this Observation by the thinner Glass,\r\n3.4-1/6.5-1/8, to the Diameters of the same Rings made in the third of\r\nthese Observations by the thicker Glass 1-11/16, 2-3/8. 2-11/12, that\r\nis, the Diameters of the Rings are reciprocally in a subduplicate\r\nProportion of the thicknesses of the Plates of Glass.\r\n\r\nSo then in Plates of Glass which are alike concave on one side, and\r\nalike convex on the other side, and alike quick-silver'd on the convex\r\nsides, and differ in nothing but their thickness, the Diameters of the\r\nRings are reciprocally in a subduplicate Proportion of the thicknesses\r\nof the Plates. And this shews sufficiently that the Rings depend on both\r\nthe Surfaces of the Glass. They depend on the convex Surface, because\r\nthey are more luminous when that Surface is quick-silver'd over than\r\nwhen it is without Quick-silver. They depend also upon the concave\r\nSurface, because without that Surface a Speculum makes them not. They\r\ndepend on both Surfaces, and on the distances between them, because\r\ntheir bigness is varied by varying only that distance. And this\r\ndependence is of the same kind with that which the Colours of thin\r\nPlates have on the distance of the Surfaces of those Plates, because the\r\nbigness of the Rings, and their Proportion to one another, and the\r\nvariation of their bigness arising from the variation of the thickness\r\nof the Glass, and the Orders of their Colours, is such as ought to\r\nresult from the Propositions in the end of the third Part of this Book,\r\nderived from the Phaenomena of the Colours of thin Plates set down in the\r\nfirst Part.\r\n\r\nThere are yet other Phaenomena of these Rings of Colours, but such as\r\nfollow from the same Propositions, and therefore confirm both the Truth\r\nof those Propositions, and the Analogy between these Rings and the Rings\r\nof Colours made by very thin Plates. I shall subjoin some of them.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 10. When the beam of the Sun's Light was reflected back from the\r\nSpeculum not directly to the hole in the Window, but to a place a little\r\ndistant from it, the common center of that Spot, and of all the Rings of\r\nColours fell in the middle way between the beam of the incident Light,\r\nand the beam of the reflected Light, and by consequence in the center of\r\nthe spherical concavity of the Speculum, whenever the Chart on which the\r\nRings of Colours fell was placed at that center. And as the beam of\r\nreflected Light by inclining the Speculum receded more and more from the\r\nbeam of incident Light and from the common center of the colour'd Rings\r\nbetween them, those Rings grew bigger and bigger, and so also did the\r\nwhite round Spot, and new Rings of Colours emerged successively out of\r\ntheir common center, and the white Spot became a white Ring\r\nencompassing them; and the incident and reflected beams of Light always\r\nfell upon the opposite parts of this white Ring, illuminating its\r\nPerimeter like two mock Suns in the opposite parts of an Iris. So then\r\nthe Diameter of this Ring, measured from the middle of its Light on one\r\nside to the middle of its Light on the other side, was always equal to\r\nthe distance between the middle of the incident beam of Light, and the\r\nmiddle of the reflected beam measured at the Chart on which the Rings\r\nappeared: And the Rays which form'd this Ring were reflected by the\r\nSpeculum in Angles equal to their Angles of Incidence, and by\r\nconsequence to their Angles of Refraction at their entrance into the\r\nGlass, but yet their Angles of Reflexion were not in the same Planes\r\nwith their Angles of Incidence.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 11. The Colours of the new Rings were in a contrary order to\r\nthose of the former, and arose after this manner. The white round Spot\r\nof Light in the middle of the Rings continued white to the center till\r\nthe distance of the incident and reflected beams at the Chart was about\r\n7/8 parts of an Inch, and then it began to grow dark in the middle. And\r\nwhen that distance was about 1-3/16 of an Inch, the white Spot was\r\nbecome a Ring encompassing a dark round Spot which in the middle\r\ninclined to violet and indigo. And the luminous Rings encompassing it\r\nwere grown equal to those dark ones which in the four first Observations\r\nencompassed them, that is to say, the white Spot was grown a white Ring\r\nequal to the first of those dark Rings, and the first of those luminous\r\nRings was now grown equal to the second of those dark ones, and the\r\nsecond of those luminous ones to the third of those dark ones, and so\r\non. For the Diameters of the luminous Rings were now 1-3/16, 2-1/16,\r\n2-2/3, 3-3/20, &c. Inches.\r\n\r\nWhen the distance between the incident and reflected beams of Light\r\nbecame a little bigger, there emerged out of the middle of the dark Spot\r\nafter the indigo a blue, and then out of that blue a pale green, and\r\nsoon after a yellow and red. And when the Colour at the center was\r\nbrightest, being between yellow and red, the bright Rings were grown\r\nequal to those Rings which in the four first Observations next\r\nencompassed them; that is to say, the white Spot in the middle of those\r\nRings was now become a white Ring equal to the first of those bright\r\nRings, and the first of those bright ones was now become equal to the\r\nsecond of those, and so on. For the Diameters of the white Ring, and of\r\nthe other luminous Rings encompassing it, were now 1-11/16, 2-3/8,\r\n2-11/12, 3-3/8, &c. or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nWhen the distance of the two beams of Light at the Chart was a little\r\nmore increased, there emerged out of the middle in order after the red,\r\na purple, a blue, a green, a yellow, and a red inclining much to purple,\r\nand when the Colour was brightest being between yellow and red, the\r\nformer indigo, blue, green, yellow and red, were become an Iris or Ring\r\nof Colours equal to the first of those luminous Rings which appeared in\r\nthe four first Observations, and the white Ring which was now become\r\nthe second of the luminous Rings was grown equal to the second of those,\r\nand the first of those which was now become the third Ring was become\r\nequal to the third of those, and so on. For their Diameters were\r\n1-11/16, 2-3/8, 2-11/12, 3-3/8 Inches, the distance of the two beams of\r\nLight, and the Diameter of the white Ring being 2-3/8 Inches.\r\n\r\nWhen these two beams became more distant there emerged out of the middle\r\nof the purplish red, first a darker round Spot, and then out of the\r\nmiddle of that Spot a brighter. And now the former Colours (purple,\r\nblue, green, yellow, and purplish red) were become a Ring equal to the\r\nfirst of the bright Rings mentioned in the four first Observations, and\r\nthe Rings about this Ring were grown equal to the Rings about that\r\nrespectively; the distance between the two beams of Light and the\r\nDiameter of the white Ring (which was now become the third Ring) being\r\nabout 3 Inches.\r\n\r\nThe Colours of the Rings in the middle began now to grow very dilute,\r\nand if the distance between the two Beams was increased half an Inch, or\r\nan Inch more, they vanish'd whilst the white Ring, with one or two of\r\nthe Rings next it on either side, continued still visible. But if the\r\ndistance of the two beams of Light was still more increased, these also\r\nvanished: For the Light which coming from several parts of the hole in\r\nthe Window fell upon the Speculum in several Angles of Incidence, made\r\nRings of several bignesses, which diluted and blotted out one another,\r\nas I knew by intercepting some part of that Light. For if I intercepted\r\nthat part which was nearest to the Axis of the Speculum the Rings would\r\nbe less, if the other part which was remotest from it they would be\r\nbigger.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 12. When the Colours of the Prism were cast successively on the\r\nSpeculum, that Ring which in the two last Observations was white, was of\r\nthe same bigness in all the Colours, but the Rings without it were\r\ngreater in the green than in the blue, and still greater in the yellow,\r\nand greatest in the red. And, on the contrary, the Rings within that\r\nwhite Circle were less in the green than in the blue, and still less in\r\nthe yellow, and least in the red. For the Angles of Reflexion of those\r\nRays which made this Ring, being equal to their Angles of Incidence, the\r\nFits of every reflected Ray within the Glass after Reflexion are equal\r\nin length and number to the Fits of the same Ray within the Glass before\r\nits Incidence on the reflecting Surface. And therefore since all the\r\nRays of all sorts at their entrance into the Glass were in a Fit of\r\nTransmission, they were also in a Fit of Transmission at their returning\r\nto the same Surface after Reflexion; and by consequence were\r\ntransmitted, and went out to the white Ring on the Chart. This is the\r\nreason why that Ring was of the same bigness in all the Colours, and why\r\nin a mixture of all it appears white. But in Rays which are reflected in\r\nother Angles, the Intervals of the Fits of the least refrangible being\r\ngreatest, make the Rings of their Colour in their progress from this\r\nwhite Ring, either outwards or inwards, increase or decrease by the\r\ngreatest steps; so that the Rings of this Colour without are greatest,\r\nand within least. And this is the reason why in the last Observation,\r\nwhen the Speculum was illuminated with white Light, the exterior Rings\r\nmade by all Colours appeared red without and blue within, and the\r\ninterior blue without and red within.\r\n\r\nThese are the Phaenomena of thick convexo-concave Plates of Glass, which\r\nare every where of the same thickness. There are yet other Phaenomena\r\nwhen these Plates are a little thicker on one side than on the other,\r\nand others when the Plates are more or less concave than convex, or\r\nplano-convex, or double-convex. For in all these cases the Plates make\r\nRings of Colours, but after various manners; all which, so far as I have\r\nyet observed, follow from the Propositions in the end of the third part\r\nof this Book, and so conspire to confirm the truth of those\r\nPropositions. But the Phaenomena are too various, and the Calculations\r\nwhereby they follow from those Propositions too intricate to be here\r\nprosecuted. I content my self with having prosecuted this kind of\r\nPhaenomena so far as to discover their Cause, and by discovering it to\r\nratify the Propositions in the third Part of this Book.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 13. As Light reflected by a Lens quick-silver'd on the backside\r\nmakes the Rings of Colours above described, so it ought to make the like\r\nRings of Colours in passing through a drop of Water. At the first\r\nReflexion of the Rays within the drop, some Colours ought to be\r\ntransmitted, as in the case of a Lens, and others to be reflected back\r\nto the Eye. For instance, if the Diameter of a small drop or globule of\r\nWater be about the 500th part of an Inch, so that a red-making Ray in\r\npassing through the middle of this globule has 250 Fits of easy\r\nTransmission within the globule, and that all the red-making Rays which\r\nare at a certain distance from this middle Ray round about it have 249\r\nFits within the globule, and all the like Rays at a certain farther\r\ndistance round about it have 248 Fits, and all those at a certain\r\nfarther distance 247 Fits, and so on; these concentrick Circles of Rays\r\nafter their transmission, falling on a white Paper, will make\r\nconcentrick Rings of red upon the Paper, supposing the Light which\r\npasses through one single globule, strong enough to be sensible. And, in\r\nlike manner, the Rays of other Colours will make Rings of other Colours.\r\nSuppose now that in a fair Day the Sun shines through a thin Cloud of\r\nsuch globules of Water or Hail, and that the globules are all of the\r\nsame bigness; and the Sun seen through this Cloud shall appear\r\nencompassed with the like concentrick Rings of Colours, and the Diameter\r\nof the first Ring of red shall be 7-1/4 Degrees, that of the second\r\n10-1/4 Degrees, that of the third 12 Degrees 33 Minutes. And accordingly\r\nas the Globules of Water are bigger or less, the Rings shall be less or\r\nbigger. This is the Theory, and Experience answers it. For in _June_\r\n1692, I saw by reflexion in a Vessel of stagnating Water three Halos,\r\nCrowns, or Rings of Colours about the Sun, like three little Rain-bows,\r\nconcentrick to his Body. The Colours of the first or innermost Crown\r\nwere blue next the Sun, red without, and white in the middle between the\r\nblue and red. Those of the second Crown were purple and blue within, and\r\npale red without, and green in the middle. And those of the third were\r\npale blue within, and pale red without; these Crowns enclosed one\r\nanother immediately, so that their Colours proceeded in this continual\r\norder from the Sun outward: blue, white, red; purple, blue, green, pale\r\nyellow and red; pale blue, pale red. The Diameter of the second Crown\r\nmeasured from the middle of the yellow and red on one side of the Sun,\r\nto the middle of the same Colour on the other side was 9-1/3 Degrees, or\r\nthereabouts. The Diameters of the first and third I had not time to\r\nmeasure, but that of the first seemed to be about five or six Degrees,\r\nand that of the third about twelve. The like Crowns appear sometimes\r\nabout the Moon; for in the beginning of the Year 1664, _Febr._ 19th at\r\nNight, I saw two such Crowns about her. The Diameter of the first or\r\ninnermost was about three Degrees, and that of the second about five\r\nDegrees and an half. Next about the Moon was a Circle of white, and next\r\nabout that the inner Crown, which was of a bluish green within next the\r\nwhite, and of a yellow and red without, and next about these Colours\r\nwere blue and green on the inside of the outward Crown, and red on the\r\noutside of it. At the same time there appear'd a Halo about 22 Degrees\r\n35' distant from the center of the Moon. It was elliptical, and its long\r\nDiameter was perpendicular to the Horizon, verging below farthest from\r\nthe Moon. I am told that the Moon has sometimes three or more\r\nconcentrick Crowns of Colours encompassing one another next about her\r\nBody. The more equal the globules of Water or Ice are to one another,\r\nthe more Crowns of Colours will appear, and the Colours will be the more\r\nlively. The Halo at the distance of 22-1/2 Degrees from the Moon is of\r\nanother sort. By its being oval and remoter from the Moon below than\r\nabove, I conclude, that it was made by Refraction in some sort of Hail\r\nor Snow floating in the Air in an horizontal posture, the refracting\r\nAngle being about 58 or 60 Degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nTHIRD BOOK\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nOPTICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART I._\r\n\r\n_Observations concerning the Inflexions of the Rays of Light, and the\r\nColours made thereby._\r\n\r\nGrimaldo has inform'd us, that if a beam of the Sun's Light be let into\r\na dark Room through a very small hole, the Shadows of things in this\r\nLight will be larger than they ought to be if the Rays went on by the\r\nBodies in straight Lines, and that these Shadows have three parallel\r\nFringes, Bands or Ranks of colour'd Light adjacent to them. But if the\r\nHole be enlarged the Fringes grow broad and run into one another, so\r\nthat they cannot be distinguish'd. These broad Shadows and Fringes have\r\nbeen reckon'd by some to proceed from the ordinary refraction of the\r\nAir, but without due examination of the Matter. For the circumstances of\r\nthe Phaenomenon, so far as I have observed them, are as follows.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 1. I made in a piece of Lead a small Hole with a Pin, whose\r\nbreadth was the 42d part of an Inch. For 21 of those Pins laid together\r\ntook up the breadth of half an Inch. Through this Hole I let into my\r\ndarken'd Chamber a beam of the Sun's Light, and found that the Shadows\r\nof Hairs, Thred, Pins, Straws, and such like slender Substances placed\r\nin this beam of Light, were considerably broader than they ought to be,\r\nif the Rays of Light passed on by these Bodies in right Lines. And\r\nparticularly a Hair of a Man's Head, whose breadth was but the 280th\r\npart of an Inch, being held in this Light, at the distance of about\r\ntwelve Feet from the Hole, did cast a Shadow which at the distance of\r\nfour Inches from the Hair was the sixtieth part of an Inch broad, that\r\nis, above four times broader than the Hair, and at the distance of two\r\nFeet from the Hair was about the eight and twentieth part of an Inch\r\nbroad, that is, ten times broader than the Hair, and at the distance of\r\nten Feet was the eighth part of an Inch broad, that is 35 times broader.\r\n\r\nNor is it material whether the Hair be encompassed with Air, or with any\r\nother pellucid Substance. For I wetted a polish'd Plate of Glass, and\r\nlaid the Hair in the Water upon the Glass, and then laying another\r\npolish'd Plate of Glass upon it, so that the Water might fill up the\r\nspace between the Glasses, I held them in the aforesaid beam of Light,\r\nso that the Light might pass through them perpendicularly, and the\r\nShadow of the Hair was at the same distances as big as before. The\r\nShadows of Scratches made in polish'd Plates of Glass were also much\r\nbroader than they ought to be, and the Veins in polish'd Plates of Glass\r\ndid also cast the like broad Shadows. And therefore the great breadth of\r\nthese Shadows proceeds from some other cause than the Refraction of the\r\nAir.\r\n\r\nLet the Circle X [in _Fig._ 1.] represent the middle of the Hair; ADG,\r\nBEH, CFI, three Rays passing by one side of the Hair at several\r\ndistances; KNQ, LOR, MPS, three other Rays passing by the other side of\r\nthe Hair at the like distances; D, E, F, and N, O, P, the places where\r\nthe Rays are bent in their passage by the Hair; G, H, I, and Q, R, S,\r\nthe places where the Rays fall on a Paper GQ; IS the breadth of the\r\nShadow of the Hair cast on the Paper, and TI, VS, two Rays passing to\r\nthe Points I and S without bending when the Hair is taken away. And it's\r\nmanifest that all the Light between these two Rays TI and VS is bent in\r\npassing by the Hair, and turned aside from the Shadow IS, because if any\r\npart of this Light were not bent it would fall on the Paper within the\r\nShadow, and there illuminate the Paper, contrary to experience. And\r\nbecause when the Paper is at a great distance from the Hair, the Shadow\r\nis broad, and therefore the Rays TI and VS are at a great distance from\r\none another, it follows that the Hair acts upon the Rays of Light at a\r\ngood distance in their passing by it. But the Action is strongest on the\r\nRays which pass by at least distances, and grows weaker and weaker\r\naccordingly as the Rays pass by at distances greater and greater, as is\r\nrepresented in the Scheme: For thence it comes to pass, that the Shadow\r\nof the Hair is much broader in proportion to the distance of the Paper\r\nfrom the Hair, when the Paper is nearer the Hair, than when it is at a\r\ngreat distance from it.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 2. The Shadows of all Bodies (Metals, Stones, Glass, Wood, Horn,\r\nIce, &c.) in this Light were border'd with three Parallel Fringes or\r\nBands of colour'd Light, whereof that which was contiguous to the Shadow\r\nwas broadest and most luminous, and that which was remotest from it was\r\nnarrowest, and so faint, as not easily to be visible. It was difficult\r\nto distinguish the Colours, unless when the Light fell very obliquely\r\nupon a smooth Paper, or some other smooth white Body, so as to make them\r\nappear much broader than they would otherwise do. And then the Colours\r\nwere plainly visible in this Order: The first or innermost Fringe was\r\nviolet and deep blue next the Shadow, and then light blue, green, and\r\nyellow in the middle, and red without. The second Fringe was almost\r\ncontiguous to the first, and the third to the second, and both were blue\r\nwithin, and yellow and red without, but their Colours were very faint,\r\nespecially those of the third. The Colours therefore proceeded in this\r\norder from the Shadow; violet, indigo, pale blue, green, yellow, red;\r\nblue, yellow, red; pale blue, pale yellow and red. The Shadows made by\r\nScratches and Bubbles in polish'd Plates of Glass were border'd with the\r\nlike Fringes of colour'd Light. And if Plates of Looking-glass sloop'd\r\noff near the edges with a Diamond-cut, be held in the same beam of\r\nLight, the Light which passes through the parallel Planes of the Glass\r\nwill be border'd with the like Fringes of Colours where those Planes\r\nmeet with the Diamond-cut, and by this means there will sometimes appear\r\nfour or five Fringes of Colours. Let AB, CD [in _Fig._ 2.] represent the\r\nparallel Planes of a Looking-glass, and BD the Plane of the Diamond-cut,\r\nmaking at B a very obtuse Angle with the Plane AB. And let all the Light\r\nbetween the Rays ENI and FBM pass directly through the parallel Planes\r\nof the Glass, and fall upon the Paper between I and M, and all the Light\r\nbetween the Rays GO and HD be refracted by the oblique Plane of the\r\nDiamond-cut BD, and fall upon the Paper between K and L; and the Light\r\nwhich passes directly through the parallel Planes of the Glass, and\r\nfalls upon the Paper between I and M, will be border'd with three or\r\nmore Fringes at M.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nSo by looking on the Sun through a Feather or black Ribband held close\r\nto the Eye, several Rain-bows will appear; the Shadows which the Fibres\r\nor Threds cast on the _Tunica Retina_, being border'd with the like\r\nFringes of Colours.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 3. When the Hair was twelve Feet distant from this Hole, and its\r\nShadow fell obliquely upon a flat white Scale of Inches and Parts of an\r\nInch placed half a Foot beyond it, and also when the Shadow fell\r\nperpendicularly upon the same Scale placed nine Feet beyond it; I\r\nmeasured the breadth of the Shadow and Fringes as accurately as I could,\r\nand found them in Parts of an Inch as follows.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\n                                           |  half a   | Nine\r\n                      At the Distance of   |   Foot    |  Feet\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe breadth of the Shadow                  |   1/54    |  1/9\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe breadth between the Middles of the     |   1/38    |\r\n  brightest Light of the innermost Fringes |    or     |\r\n  on either side the Shadow                |   1/39    |  7/50\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe breadth between the Middles of the     |           |\r\n  brightest Light of the middlemost Fringes|           |\r\n  on either side the Shadow                | 1/23-1/2  |  4/17\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe breadth between the Middles of the     |  1/18     |\r\n  brightest Light of the outmost Fringes   |   or      |\r\n  on either side the Shadow                | 1/18-1/2  |  3/10\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe distance between the Middles of the    |           |\r\n  brightest Light of the first and second  |           |\r\n  Fringes                                  |  1/120    |  1/21\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe distance between the Middles of the    |           |\r\n  brightest Light of the second and third  |           |\r\n  Fringes                                  |  1/170    |  1/31\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe breadth of the luminous Part (green,   |           |\r\n  white, yellow, and red) of the first     |           |\r\n  Fringe                                   |  1/170    |  1/32\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe breadth of the darker Space between    |           |\r\n  the first and second Fringes             |  1/240    |  1/45\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe breadth of the luminous Part of the    |           |\r\n  second Fringe                            |  1/290    |  1/55\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\nThe breadth of the darker Space between    |           |\r\n  the second and third Fringes             |  1/340    |  1/63\r\n-------------------------------------------+-----------+--------\r\n\r\nThese Measures I took by letting the Shadow of the Hair, at half a Foot\r\ndistance, fall so obliquely on the Scale, as to appear twelve times\r\nbroader than when it fell perpendicularly on it at the same distance,\r\nand setting down in this Table the twelfth part of the Measures I then\r\ntook.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 4. When the Shadow and Fringes were cast obliquely upon a smooth\r\nwhite Body, and that Body was removed farther and farther from the Hair,\r\nthe first Fringe began to appear and look brighter than the rest of the\r\nLight at the distance of less than a quarter of an Inch from the Hair,\r\nand the dark Line or Shadow between that and the second Fringe began to\r\nappear at a less distance from the Hair than that of the third part of\r\nan Inch. The second Fringe began to appear at a distance from the Hair\r\nof less than half an Inch, and the Shadow between that and the third\r\nFringe at a distance less than an inch, and the third Fringe at a\r\ndistance less than three Inches. At greater distances they became much\r\nmore sensible, but kept very nearly the same proportion of their\r\nbreadths and intervals which they had at their first appearing. For the\r\ndistance between the middle of the first, and middle of the second\r\nFringe, was to the distance between the middle of the second and middle\r\nof the third Fringe, as three to two, or ten to seven. And the last of\r\nthese two distances was equal to the breadth of the bright Light or\r\nluminous part of the first Fringe. And this breadth was to the breadth\r\nof the bright Light of the second Fringe as seven to four, and to the\r\ndark Interval of the first and second Fringe as three to two, and to\r\nthe like dark Interval between the second and third as two to one. For\r\nthe breadths of the Fringes seem'd to be in the progression of the\r\nNumbers 1, sqrt(1/3), sqrt(1/5), and their Intervals to be in the\r\nsame progression with them; that is, the Fringes and their Intervals\r\ntogether to be in the continual progression of the Numbers 1,\r\nsqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/3), sqrt(1/4), sqrt(1/5), or thereabouts. And\r\nthese Proportions held the same very nearly at all distances from the\r\nHair; the dark Intervals of the Fringes being as broad in proportion to\r\nthe breadth of the Fringes at their first appearance as afterwards at\r\ngreat distances from the Hair, though not so dark and distinct.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 5. The Sun shining into my darken'd Chamber through a hole a\r\nquarter of an Inch broad, I placed at the distance of two or three Feet\r\nfrom the Hole a Sheet of Pasteboard, which was black'd all over on both\r\nsides, and in the middle of it had a hole about three quarters of an\r\nInch square for the Light to pass through. And behind the hole I\r\nfasten'd to the Pasteboard with Pitch the blade of a sharp Knife, to\r\nintercept some part of the Light which passed through the hole. The\r\nPlanes of the Pasteboard and blade of the Knife were parallel to one\r\nanother, and perpendicular to the Rays. And when they were so placed\r\nthat none of the Sun's Light fell on the Pasteboard, but all of it\r\npassed through the hole to the Knife, and there part of it fell upon the\r\nblade of the Knife, and part of it passed by its edge; I let this part\r\nof the Light which passed by, fall on a white Paper two or three Feet\r\nbeyond the Knife, and there saw two streams of faint Light shoot out\r\nboth ways from the beam of Light into the shadow, like the Tails of\r\nComets. But because the Sun's direct Light by its brightness upon the\r\nPaper obscured these faint streams, so that I could scarce see them, I\r\nmade a little hole in the midst of the Paper for that Light to pass\r\nthrough and fall on a black Cloth behind it; and then I saw the two\r\nstreams plainly. They were like one another, and pretty nearly equal in\r\nlength, and breadth, and quantity of Light. Their Light at that end next\r\nthe Sun's direct Light was pretty strong for the space of about a\r\nquarter of an Inch, or half an Inch, and in all its progress from that\r\ndirect Light decreased gradually till it became insensible. The whole\r\nlength of either of these streams measured upon the paper at the\r\ndistance of three Feet from the Knife was about six or eight Inches; so\r\nthat it subtended an Angle at the edge of the Knife of about 10 or 12,\r\nor at most 14 Degrees. Yet sometimes I thought I saw it shoot three or\r\nfour Degrees farther, but with a Light so very faint that I could scarce\r\nperceive it, and suspected it might (in some measure at least) arise\r\nfrom some other cause than the two streams did. For placing my Eye in\r\nthat Light beyond the end of that stream which was behind the Knife, and\r\nlooking towards the Knife, I could see a line of Light upon its edge,\r\nand that not only when my Eye was in the line of the Streams, but also\r\nwhen it was without that line either towards the point of the Knife, or\r\ntowards the handle. This line of Light appear'd contiguous to the edge\r\nof the Knife, and was narrower than the Light of the innermost Fringe,\r\nand narrowest when my Eye was farthest from the direct Light, and\r\ntherefore seem'd to pass between the Light of that Fringe and the edge\r\nof the Knife, and that which passed nearest the edge to be most bent,\r\nthough not all of it.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 6. I placed another Knife by this, so that their edges might be\r\nparallel, and look towards one another, and that the beam of Light might\r\nfall upon both the Knives, and some part of it pass between their edges.\r\nAnd when the distance of their edges was about the 400th part of an\r\nInch, the stream parted in the middle, and left a Shadow between the two\r\nparts. This Shadow was so black and dark that all the Light which passed\r\nbetween the Knives seem'd to be bent, and turn'd aside to the one hand\r\nor to the other. And as the Knives still approach'd one another the\r\nShadow grew broader, and the streams shorter at their inward ends which\r\nwere next the Shadow, until upon the contact of the Knives the whole\r\nLight vanish'd, leaving its place to the Shadow.\r\n\r\nAnd hence I gather that the Light which is least bent, and goes to the\r\ninward ends of the streams, passes by the edges of the Knives at the\r\ngreatest distance, and this distance when the Shadow begins to appear\r\nbetween the streams, is about the 800th part of an Inch. And the Light\r\nwhich passes by the edges of the Knives at distances still less and\r\nless, is more and more bent, and goes to those parts of the streams\r\nwhich are farther and farther from the direct Light; because when the\r\nKnives approach one another till they touch, those parts of the streams\r\nvanish last which are farthest from the direct Light.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 7. In the fifth Observation the Fringes did not appear, but by\r\nreason of the breadth of the hole in the Window became so broad as to\r\nrun into one another, and by joining, to make one continued Light in the\r\nbeginning of the streams. But in the sixth, as the Knives approached one\r\nanother, a little before the Shadow appeared between the two streams,\r\nthe Fringes began to appear on the inner ends of the Streams on either\r\nside of the direct Light; three on one side made by the edge of one\r\nKnife, and three on the other side made by the edge of the other Knife.\r\nThey were distinctest when the Knives were placed at the greatest\r\ndistance from the hole in the Window, and still became more distinct by\r\nmaking the hole less, insomuch that I could sometimes see a faint\r\nlineament of a fourth Fringe beyond the three above mention'd. And as\r\nthe Knives continually approach'd one another, the Fringes grew\r\ndistincter and larger, until they vanish'd. The outmost Fringe vanish'd\r\nfirst, and the middlemost next, and the innermost last. And after they\r\nwere all vanish'd, and the line of Light which was in the middle between\r\nthem was grown very broad, enlarging it self on both sides into the\r\nstreams of Light described in the fifth Observation, the above-mention'd\r\nShadow began to appear in the middle of this line, and divide it along\r\nthe middle into two lines of Light, and increased until the whole Light\r\nvanish'd. This enlargement of the Fringes was so great that the Rays\r\nwhich go to the innermost Fringe seem'd to be bent above twenty times\r\nmore when this Fringe was ready to vanish, than when one of the Knives\r\nwas taken away.\r\n\r\nAnd from this and the former Observation compared, I gather, that the\r\nLight of the first Fringe passed by the edge of the Knife at a distance\r\ngreater than the 800th part of an Inch, and the Light of the second\r\nFringe passed by the edge of the Knife at a greater distance than the\r\nLight of the first Fringe did, and that of the third at a greater\r\ndistance than that of the second, and that of the streams of Light\r\ndescribed in the fifth and sixth Observations passed by the edges of the\r\nKnives at less distances than that of any of the Fringes.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 8. I caused the edges of two Knives to be ground truly strait,\r\nand pricking their points into a Board so that their edges might look\r\ntowards one another, and meeting near their points contain a rectilinear\r\nAngle, I fasten'd their Handles together with Pitch to make this Angle\r\ninvariable. The distance of the edges of the Knives from one another at\r\nthe distance of four Inches from the angular Point, where the edges of\r\nthe Knives met, was the eighth part of an Inch; and therefore the Angle\r\ncontain'd by the edges was about one Degree 54: The Knives thus fix'd\r\ntogether I placed in a beam of the Sun's Light, let into my darken'd\r\nChamber through a Hole the 42d Part of an Inch wide, at the distance of\r\n10 or 15 Feet from the Hole, and let the Light which passed between\r\ntheir edges fall very obliquely upon a smooth white Ruler at the\r\ndistance of half an Inch, or an Inch from the Knives, and there saw the\r\nFringes by the two edges of the Knives run along the edges of the\r\nShadows of the Knives in Lines parallel to those edges without growing\r\nsensibly broader, till they met in Angles equal to the Angle contained\r\nby the edges of the Knives, and where they met and joined they ended\r\nwithout crossing one another. But if the Ruler was held at a much\r\ngreater distance from the Knives, the Fringes where they were farther\r\nfrom the Place of their Meeting, were a little narrower, and became\r\nsomething broader and broader as they approach'd nearer and nearer to\r\none another, and after they met they cross'd one another, and then\r\nbecame much broader than before.\r\n\r\nWhence I gather that the distances at which the Fringes pass by the\r\nKnives are not increased nor alter'd by the approach of the Knives, but\r\nthe Angles in which the Rays are there bent are much increased by that\r\napproach; and that the Knife which is nearest any Ray determines which\r\nway the Ray shall be bent, and the other Knife increases the bent.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 9. When the Rays fell very obliquely upon the Ruler at the\r\ndistance of the third Part of an Inch from the Knives, the dark Line\r\nbetween the first and second Fringe of the Shadow of one Knife, and the\r\ndark Line between the first and second Fringe of the Shadow of the other\r\nknife met with one another, at the distance of the fifth Part of an Inch\r\nfrom the end of the Light which passed between the Knives at the\r\nconcourse of their edges. And therefore the distance of the edges of the\r\nKnives at the meeting of these dark Lines was the 160th Part of an Inch.\r\nFor as four Inches to the eighth Part of an Inch, so is any Length of\r\nthe edges of the Knives measured from the point of their concourse to\r\nthe distance of the edges of the Knives at the end of that Length, and\r\nso is the fifth Part of an Inch to the 160th Part. So then the dark\r\nLines above-mention'd meet in the middle of the Light which passes\r\nbetween the Knives where they are distant the 160th Part of an Inch, and\r\nthe one half of that Light passes by the edge of one Knife at a distance\r\nnot greater than the 320th Part of an Inch, and falling upon the Paper\r\nmakes the Fringes of the Shadow of that Knife, and the other half passes\r\nby the edge of the other Knife, at a distance not greater than the 320th\r\nPart of an Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the Fringes of the\r\nShadow of the other Knife. But if the Paper be held at a distance from\r\nthe Knives greater than the third Part of an Inch, the dark Lines\r\nabove-mention'd meet at a greater distance than the fifth Part of an\r\nInch from the end of the Light which passed between the Knives at the\r\nconcourse of their edges; and therefore the Light which falls upon the\r\nPaper where those dark Lines meet passes between the Knives where the\r\nedges are distant above the 160th part of an Inch.\r\n\r\nFor at another time, when the two Knives were distant eight Feet and\r\nfive Inches from the little hole in the Window, made with a small Pin as\r\nabove, the Light which fell upon the Paper where the aforesaid dark\r\nlines met, passed between the Knives, where the distance between their\r\nedges was as in the following Table, when the distance of the Paper from\r\nthe Knives was also as follows.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------+------------------------------\r\n                             | Distances between the edges\r\n Distances of the Paper      |  of the Knives in millesimal\r\n from the Knives in Inches.  |      parts of an Inch.\r\n-----------------------------+------------------------------\r\n          1-1/2.             |             0'012\r\n          3-1/3.             |             0'020\r\n          8-3/5.             |             0'034\r\n         32.                 |             0'057\r\n         96.                 |             0'081\r\n        131.                 |             0'087\r\n_____________________________|______________________________\r\n\r\nAnd hence I gather, that the Light which makes the Fringes upon the\r\nPaper is not the same Light at all distances of the Paper from the\r\nKnives, but when the Paper is held near the Knives, the Fringes are made\r\nby Light which passes by the edges of the Knives at a less distance, and\r\nis more bent than when the Paper is held at a greater distance from the\r\nKnives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 10. When the Fringes of the Shadows of the Knives fell\r\nperpendicularly upon a Paper at a great distance from the Knives, they\r\nwere in the form of Hyperbola's, and their Dimensions were as follows.\r\nLet CA, CB [in _Fig._ 3.] represent Lines drawn upon the Paper parallel\r\nto the edges of the Knives, and between which all the Light would fall,\r\nif it passed between the edges of the Knives without inflexion; DE a\r\nRight Line drawn through C making the Angles ACD, BCE, equal to one\r\nanother, and terminating all the Light which falls upon the Paper from\r\nthe point where the edges of the Knives meet; _eis_, _fkt_, and _glv_,\r\nthree hyperbolical Lines representing the Terminus of the Shadow of one\r\nof the Knives, the dark Line between the first and second Fringes of\r\nthat Shadow, and the dark Line between the second and third Fringes of\r\nthe same Shadow; _xip_, _ykq_, and _zlr_, three other hyperbolical Lines\r\nrepresenting the Terminus of the Shadow of the other Knife, the dark\r\nLine between the first and second Fringes of that Shadow, and the dark\r\nline between the second and third Fringes of the same Shadow. And\r\nconceive that these three Hyperbola's are like and equal to the former\r\nthree, and cross them in the points _i_, _k_, and _l_, and that the\r\nShadows of the Knives are terminated and distinguish'd from the first\r\nluminous Fringes by the lines _eis_ and _xip_, until the meeting and\r\ncrossing of the Fringes, and then those lines cross the Fringes in the\r\nform of dark lines, terminating the first luminous Fringes within side,\r\nand distinguishing them from another Light which begins to appear at\r\n_i_, and illuminates all the triangular space _ip_DE_s_ comprehended by\r\nthese dark lines, and the right line DE. Of these Hyperbola's one\r\nAsymptote is the line DE, and their other Asymptotes are parallel to the\r\nlines CA and CB. Let _rv_ represent a line drawn any where upon the\r\nPaper parallel to the Asymptote DE, and let this line cross the right\r\nlines AC in _m_, and BC in _n_, and the six dark hyperbolical lines in\r\n_p_, _q_, _r_; _s_, _t_, _v_; and by measuring the distances _ps_, _qt_,\r\n_rv_, and thence collecting the lengths of the Ordinates _np_, _nq_,\r\n_nr_ or _ms_, _mt_, _mv_, and doing this at several distances of the\r\nline _rv_ from the Asymptote DD, you may find as many points of these\r\nHyperbola's as you please, and thereby know that these curve lines are\r\nHyperbola's differing little from the conical Hyperbola. And by\r\nmeasuring the lines C_i_, C_k_, C_l_, you may find other points of these\r\nCurves.\r\n\r\nFor instance; when the Knives were distant from the hole in the Window\r\nten Feet, and the Paper from the Knives nine Feet, and the Angle\r\ncontained by the edges of the Knives to which the Angle ACB is equal,\r\nwas subtended by a Chord which was to the Radius as 1 to 32, and the\r\ndistance of the line _rv_ from the Asymptote DE was half an Inch: I\r\nmeasured the lines _ps_, _qt_, _rv_, and found them 0'35, 0'65, 0'98\r\nInches respectively; and by adding to their halfs the line 1/2 _mn_,\r\n(which here was the 128th part of an Inch, or 0'0078 Inches,) the Sums\r\n_np_, _nq_, _nr_, were 0'1828, 0'3328, 0'4978 Inches. I measured also\r\nthe distances of the brightest parts of the Fringes which run between\r\n_pq_ and _st_, _qr_ and _tv_, and next beyond _r_ and _v_, and found\r\nthem 0'5, 0'8, and 1'17 Inches.\r\n\r\n_Obs._ 11. The Sun shining into my darken'd Room through a small round\r\nhole made in a Plate of Lead with a slender Pin, as above; I placed at\r\nthe hole a Prism to refract the Light, and form on the opposite Wall the\r\nSpectrum of Colours, described in the third Experiment of the first\r\nBook. And then I found that the Shadows of all Bodies held in the\r\ncolour'd Light between the Prism and the Wall, were border'd with\r\nFringes of the Colour of that Light in which they were held. In the full\r\nred Light they were totally red without any sensible blue or violet, and\r\nin the deep blue Light they were totally blue without any sensible red\r\nor yellow; and so in the green Light they were totally green, excepting\r\na little yellow and blue, which were mixed in the green Light of the\r\nPrism. And comparing the Fringes made in the several colour'd Lights, I\r\nfound that those made in the red Light were largest, those made in the\r\nviolet were least, and those made in the green were of a middle bigness.\r\nFor the Fringes with which the Shadow of a Man's Hair were bordered,\r\nbeing measured cross the Shadow at the distance of six Inches from the\r\nHair, the distance between the middle and most luminous part of the\r\nfirst or innermost Fringe on one side of the Shadow, and that of the\r\nlike Fringe on the other side of the Shadow, was in the full red Light\r\n1/37-1/4 of an Inch, and in the full violet 7/46. And the like distance\r\nbetween the middle and most luminous parts of the second Fringes on\r\neither side the Shadow was in the full red Light 1/22, and in the violet\r\n1/27 of an Inch. And these distances of the Fringes held the same\r\nproportion at all distances from the Hair without any sensible\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nSo then the Rays which made these Fringes in the red Light passed by the\r\nHair at a greater distance than those did which made the like Fringes in\r\nthe violet; and therefore the Hair in causing these Fringes acted alike\r\nupon the red Light or least refrangible Rays at a greater distance, and\r\nupon the violet or most refrangible Rays at a less distance, and by\r\nthose actions disposed the red Light into Larger Fringes, and the violet\r\ninto smaller, and the Lights of intermediate Colours into Fringes of\r\nintermediate bignesses without changing the Colour of any sort of Light.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore the Hair in the first and second of these Observations\r\nwas held in the white beam of the Sun's Light, and cast a Shadow which\r\nwas border'd with three Fringes of coloured Light, those Colours arose\r\nnot from any new modifications impress'd upon the Rays of Light by the\r\nHair, but only from the various inflexions whereby the several Sorts of\r\nRays were separated from one another, which before separation, by the\r\nmixture of all their Colours, composed the white beam of the Sun's\r\nLight, but whenever separated compose Lights of the several Colours\r\nwhich they are originally disposed to exhibit. In this 11th Observation,\r\nwhere the Colours are separated before the Light passes by the Hair, the\r\nleast refrangible Rays, which when separated from the rest make red,\r\nwere inflected at a greater distance from the Hair, so as to make three\r\nred Fringes at a greater distance from the middle of the Shadow of the\r\nHair; and the most refrangible Rays which when separated make violet,\r\nwere inflected at a less distance from the Hair, so as to make three\r\nviolet Fringes at a less distance from the middle of the Shadow of the\r\nHair. And other Rays of intermediate degrees of Refrangibility were\r\ninflected at intermediate distances from the Hair, so as to make Fringes\r\nof intermediate Colours at intermediate distances from the middle of the\r\nShadow of the Hair. And in the second Observation, where all the Colours\r\nare mix'd in the white Light which passes by the Hair, these Colours are\r\nseparated by the various inflexions of the Rays, and the Fringes which\r\nthey make appear all together, and the innermost Fringes being\r\ncontiguous make one broad Fringe composed of all the Colours in due\r\norder, the violet lying on the inside of the Fringe next the Shadow, the\r\nred on the outside farthest from the Shadow, and the blue, green, and\r\nyellow, in the middle. And, in like manner, the middlemost Fringes of\r\nall the Colours lying in order, and being contiguous, make another broad\r\nFringe composed of all the Colours; and the outmost Fringes of all the\r\nColours lying in order, and being contiguous, make a third broad Fringe\r\ncomposed of all the Colours. These are the three Fringes of colour'd\r\nLight with which the Shadows of all Bodies are border'd in the second\r\nObservation.\r\n\r\nWhen I made the foregoing Observations, I design'd to repeat most of\r\nthem with more care and exactness, and to make some new ones for\r\ndetermining the manner how the Rays of Light are bent in their passage\r\nby Bodies, for making the Fringes of Colours with the dark lines between\r\nthem. But I was then interrupted, and cannot now think of taking these\r\nthings into farther Consideration. And since I have not finish'd this\r\npart of my Design, I shall conclude with proposing only some Queries, in\r\norder to a farther search to be made by others.\r\n\r\n_Query_ 1. Do not Bodies act upon Light at a distance, and by their\r\naction bend its Rays; and is not this action (_caeteris paribus_)\r\nstrongest at the least distance?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 2. Do not the Rays which differ in Refrangibility differ also in\r\nFlexibity; and are they not by their different Inflexions separated from\r\none another, so as after separation to make the Colours in the three\r\nFringes above described? And after what manner are they inflected to\r\nmake those Fringes?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 3. Are not the Rays of Light in passing by the edges and sides of\r\nBodies, bent several times backwards and forwards, with a motion like\r\nthat of an Eel? And do not the three Fringes of colour'd Light\r\nabove-mention'd arise from three such bendings?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 4. Do not the Rays of Light which fall upon Bodies, and are\r\nreflected or refracted, begin to bend before they arrive at the Bodies;\r\nand are they not reflected, refracted, and inflected, by one and the\r\nsame Principle, acting variously in various Circumstances?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 5. Do not Bodies and Light act mutually upon one another; that is\r\nto say, Bodies upon Light in emitting, reflecting, refracting and\r\ninflecting it, and Light upon Bodies for heating them, and putting their\r\nparts into a vibrating motion wherein heat consists?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 6. Do not black Bodies conceive heat more easily from Light than\r\nthose of other Colours do, by reason that the Light falling on them is\r\nnot reflected outwards, but enters the Bodies, and is often reflected\r\nand refracted within them, until it be stifled and lost?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 7. Is not the strength and vigor of the action between Light and\r\nsulphureous Bodies observed above, one reason why sulphureous Bodies\r\ntake fire more readily, and burn more vehemently than other Bodies do?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 8. Do not all fix'd Bodies, when heated beyond a certain degree,\r\nemit Light and shine; and is not this Emission perform'd by the\r\nvibrating motions of their parts? And do not all Bodies which abound\r\nwith terrestrial parts, and especially with sulphureous ones, emit Light\r\nas often as those parts are sufficiently agitated; whether that\r\nagitation be made by Heat, or by Friction, or Percussion, or\r\nPutrefaction, or by any vital Motion, or any other Cause? As for\r\ninstance; Sea-Water in a raging Storm; Quick-silver agitated in _vacuo_;\r\nthe Back of a Cat, or Neck of a Horse, obliquely struck or rubbed in a\r\ndark place; Wood, Flesh and Fish while they putrefy; Vapours arising\r\nfrom putrefy'd Waters, usually call'd _Ignes Fatui_; Stacks of moist Hay\r\nor Corn growing hot by fermentation; Glow-worms and the Eyes of some\r\nAnimals by vital Motions; the vulgar _Phosphorus_ agitated by the\r\nattrition of any Body, or by the acid Particles of the Air; Amber and\r\nsome Diamonds by striking, pressing or rubbing them; Scrapings of Steel\r\nstruck off with a Flint; Iron hammer'd very nimbly till it become so hot\r\nas to kindle Sulphur thrown upon it; the Axletrees of Chariots taking\r\nfire by the rapid rotation of the Wheels; and some Liquors mix'd with\r\none another whose Particles come together with an Impetus, as Oil of\r\nVitriol distilled from its weight of Nitre, and then mix'd with twice\r\nits weight of Oil of Anniseeds. So also a Globe of Glass about 8 or 10\r\nInches in diameter, being put into a Frame where it may be swiftly\r\nturn'd round its Axis, will in turning shine where it rubs against the\r\npalm of ones Hand apply'd to it: And if at the same time a piece of\r\nwhite Paper or white Cloth, or the end of ones Finger be held at the\r\ndistance of about a quarter of an Inch or half an Inch from that part of\r\nthe Glass where it is most in motion, the electrick Vapour which is\r\nexcited by the friction of the Glass against the Hand, will by dashing\r\nagainst the white Paper, Cloth or Finger, be put into such an agitation\r\nas to emit Light, and make the white Paper, Cloth or Finger, appear\r\nlucid like a Glowworm; and in rushing out of the Glass will sometimes\r\npush against the finger so as to be felt. And the same things have been\r\nfound by rubbing a long and large Cylinder or Glass or Amber with a\r\nPaper held in ones hand, and continuing the friction till the Glass grew\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 9. Is not Fire a Body heated so hot as to emit Light copiously?\r\nFor what else is a red hot Iron than Fire? And what else is a burning\r\nCoal than red hot Wood?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 10. Is not Flame a Vapour, Fume or Exhalation heated red hot, that\r\nis, so hot as to shine? For Bodies do not flame without emitting a\r\ncopious Fume, and this Fume burns in the Flame. The _Ignis Fatuus_ is a\r\nVapour shining without heat, and is there not the same difference\r\nbetween this Vapour and Flame, as between rotten Wood shining without\r\nheat and burning Coals of Fire? In distilling hot Spirits, if the Head\r\nof the Still be taken off, the Vapour which ascends out of the Still\r\nwill take fire at the Flame of a Candle, and turn into Flame, and the\r\nFlame will run along the Vapour from the Candle to the Still. Some\r\nBodies heated by Motion, or Fermentation, if the heat grow intense, fume\r\ncopiously, and if the heat be great enough the Fumes will shine and\r\nbecome Flame. Metals in fusion do not flame for want of a copious Fume,\r\nexcept Spelter, which fumes copiously, and thereby flames. All flaming\r\nBodies, as Oil, Tallow, Wax, Wood, fossil Coals, Pitch, Sulphur, by\r\nflaming waste and vanish into burning Smoke, which Smoke, if the Flame\r\nbe put out, is very thick and visible, and sometimes smells strongly,\r\nbut in the Flame loses its smell by burning, and according to the nature\r\nof the Smoke the Flame is of several Colours, as that of Sulphur blue,\r\nthat of Copper open'd with sublimate green, that of Tallow yellow, that\r\nof Camphire white. Smoke passing through Flame cannot but grow red hot,\r\nand red hot Smoke can have no other appearance than that of Flame. When\r\nGun-powder takes fire, it goes away into Flaming Smoke. For the Charcoal\r\nand Sulphur easily take fire, and set fire to the Nitre, and the Spirit\r\nof the Nitre being thereby rarified into Vapour, rushes out with\r\nExplosion much after the manner that the Vapour of Water rushes out of\r\nan AEolipile; the Sulphur also being volatile is converted into Vapour,\r\nand augments the Explosion. And the acid Vapour of the Sulphur (namely\r\nthat which distils under a Bell into Oil of Sulphur,) entring violently\r\ninto the fix'd Body of the Nitre, sets loose the Spirit of the Nitre,\r\nand excites a great Fermentation, whereby the Heat is farther augmented,\r\nand the fix'd Body of the Nitre is also rarified into Fume, and the\r\nExplosion is thereby made more vehement and quick. For if Salt of Tartar\r\nbe mix'd with Gun-powder, and that Mixture be warm'd till it takes fire,\r\nthe Explosion will be more violent and quick than that of Gun-powder\r\nalone; which cannot proceed from any other cause than the action of the\r\nVapour of the Gun-powder upon the Salt of Tartar, whereby that Salt is\r\nrarified. The Explosion of Gun-powder arises therefore from the violent\r\naction whereby all the Mixture being quickly and vehemently heated, is\r\nrarified and converted into Fume and Vapour: which Vapour, by the\r\nviolence of that action, becoming so hot as to shine, appears in the\r\nform of Flame.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 11. Do not great Bodies conserve their heat the longest, their\r\nparts heating one another, and may not great dense and fix'd Bodies,\r\nwhen heated beyond a certain degree, emit Light so copiously, as by the\r\nEmission and Re-action of its Light, and the Reflexions and Refractions\r\nof its Rays within its Pores to grow still hotter, till it comes to a\r\ncertain period of heat, such as is that of the Sun? And are not the Sun\r\nand fix'd Stars great Earths vehemently hot, whose heat is conserved by\r\nthe greatness of the Bodies, and the mutual Action and Reaction between\r\nthem, and the Light which they emit, and whose parts are kept from\r\nfuming away, not only by their fixity, but also by the vast weight and\r\ndensity of the Atmospheres incumbent upon them; and very strongly\r\ncompressing them, and condensing the Vapours and Exhalations which arise\r\nfrom them? For if Water be made warm in any pellucid Vessel emptied of\r\nAir, that Water in the _Vacuum_ will bubble and boil as vehemently as it\r\nwould in the open Air in a Vessel set upon the Fire till it conceives a\r\nmuch greater heat. For the weight of the incumbent Atmosphere keeps down\r\nthe Vapours, and hinders the Water from boiling, until it grow much\r\nhotter than is requisite to make it boil _in vacuo_. Also a mixture of\r\nTin and Lead being put upon a red hot Iron _in vacuo_ emits a Fume and\r\nFlame, but the same Mixture in the open Air, by reason of the incumbent\r\nAtmosphere, does not so much as emit any Fume which can be perceived by\r\nSight. In like manner the great weight of the Atmosphere which lies upon\r\nthe Globe of the Sun may hinder Bodies there from rising up and going\r\naway from the Sun in the form of Vapours and Fumes, unless by means of a\r\nfar greater heat than that which on the Surface of our Earth would very\r\neasily turn them into Vapours and Fumes. And the same great weight may\r\ncondense those Vapours and Exhalations as soon as they shall at any time\r\nbegin to ascend from the Sun, and make them presently fall back again\r\ninto him, and by that action increase his Heat much after the manner\r\nthat in our Earth the Air increases the Heat of a culinary Fire. And the\r\nsame weight may hinder the Globe of the Sun from being diminish'd,\r\nunless by the Emission of Light, and a very small quantity of Vapours\r\nand Exhalations.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 12. Do not the Rays of Light in falling upon the bottom of the Eye\r\nexcite Vibrations in the _Tunica Retina_? Which Vibrations, being\r\npropagated along the solid Fibres of the optick Nerves into the Brain,\r\ncause the Sense of seeing. For because dense Bodies conserve their Heat\r\na long time, and the densest Bodies conserve their Heat the longest, the\r\nVibrations of their parts are of a lasting nature, and therefore may be\r\npropagated along solid Fibres of uniform dense Matter to a great\r\ndistance, for conveying into the Brain the impressions made upon all the\r\nOrgans of Sense. For that Motion which can continue long in one and the\r\nsame part of a Body, can be propagated a long way from one part to\r\nanother, supposing the Body homogeneal, so that the Motion may not be\r\nreflected, refracted, interrupted or disorder'd by any unevenness of the\r\nBody.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 13. Do not several sorts of Rays make Vibrations of several\r\nbignesses, which according to their bignesses excite Sensations of\r\nseveral Colours, much after the manner that the Vibrations of the Air,\r\naccording to their several bignesses excite Sensations of several\r\nSounds? And particularly do not the most refrangible Rays excite the\r\nshortest Vibrations for making a Sensation of deep violet, the least\r\nrefrangible the largest for making a Sensation of deep red, and the\r\nseveral intermediate sorts of Rays, Vibrations of several intermediate\r\nbignesses to make Sensations of the several intermediate Colours?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 14. May not the harmony and discord of Colours arise from the\r\nproportions of the Vibrations propagated through the Fibres of the\r\noptick Nerves into the Brain, as the harmony and discord of Sounds arise\r\nfrom the proportions of the Vibrations of the Air? For some Colours, if\r\nthey be view'd together, are agreeable to one another, as those of Gold\r\nand Indigo, and others disagree.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 15. Are not the Species of Objects seen with both Eyes united\r\nwhere the optick Nerves meet before they come into the Brain, the Fibres\r\non the right side of both Nerves uniting there, and after union going\r\nthence into the Brain in the Nerve which is on the right side of the\r\nHead, and the Fibres on the left side of both Nerves uniting in the same\r\nplace, and after union going into the Brain in the Nerve which is on the\r\nleft side of the Head, and these two Nerves meeting in the Brain in such\r\na manner that their Fibres make but one entire Species or Picture, half\r\nof which on the right side of the Sensorium comes from the right side of\r\nboth Eyes through the right side of both optick Nerves to the place\r\nwhere the Nerves meet, and from thence on the right side of the Head\r\ninto the Brain, and the other half on the left side of the Sensorium\r\ncomes in like manner from the left side of both Eyes. For the optick\r\nNerves of such Animals as look the same way with both Eyes (as of Men,\r\nDogs, Sheep, Oxen, &c.) meet before they come into the Brain, but the\r\noptick Nerves of such Animals as do not look the same way with both Eyes\r\n(as of Fishes, and of the Chameleon,) do not meet, if I am rightly\r\ninform'd.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 16. When a Man in the dark presses either corner of his Eye with\r\nhis Finger, and turns his Eye away from his Finger, he will see a Circle\r\nof Colours like those in the Feather of a Peacock's Tail. If the Eye and\r\nthe Finger remain quiet these Colours vanish in a second Minute of Time,\r\nbut if the Finger be moved with a quavering Motion they appear again. Do\r\nnot these Colours arise from such Motions excited in the bottom of the\r\nEye by the Pressure and Motion of the Finger, as, at other times are\r\nexcited there by Light for causing Vision? And do not the Motions once\r\nexcited continue about a Second of Time before they cease? And when a\r\nMan by a stroke upon his Eye sees a flash of Light, are not the like\r\nMotions excited in the _Retina_ by the stroke? And when a Coal of Fire\r\nmoved nimbly in the circumference of a Circle, makes the whole\r\ncircumference appear like a Circle of Fire; is it not because the\r\nMotions excited in the bottom of the Eye by the Rays of Light are of a\r\nlasting nature, and continue till the Coal of Fire in going round\r\nreturns to its former place? And considering the lastingness of the\r\nMotions excited in the bottom of the Eye by Light, are they not of a\r\nvibrating nature?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 17. If a stone be thrown into stagnating Water, the Waves excited\r\nthereby continue some time to arise in the place where the Stone fell\r\ninto the Water, and are propagated from thence in concentrick Circles\r\nupon the Surface of the Water to great distances. And the Vibrations or\r\nTremors excited in the Air by percussion, continue a little time to move\r\nfrom the place of percussion in concentrick Spheres to great distances.\r\nAnd in like manner, when a Ray of Light falls upon the Surface of any\r\npellucid Body, and is there refracted or reflected, may not Waves of\r\nVibrations, or Tremors, be thereby excited in the refracting or\r\nreflecting Medium at the point of Incidence, and continue to arise\r\nthere, and to be propagated from thence as long as they continue to\r\narise and be propagated, when they are excited in the bottom of the Eye\r\nby the Pressure or Motion of the Finger, or by the Light which comes\r\nfrom the Coal of Fire in the Experiments above-mention'd? and are not\r\nthese Vibrations propagated from the point of Incidence to great\r\ndistances? And do they not overtake the Rays of Light, and by overtaking\r\nthem successively, do they not put them into the Fits of easy Reflexion\r\nand easy Transmission described above? For if the Rays endeavour to\r\nrecede from the densest part of the Vibration, they may be alternately\r\naccelerated and retarded by the Vibrations overtaking them.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 18. If in two large tall cylindrical Vessels of Glass inverted,\r\ntwo little Thermometers be suspended so as not to touch the Vessels, and\r\nthe Air be drawn out of one of these Vessels, and these Vessels thus\r\nprepared be carried out of a cold place into a warm one; the Thermometer\r\n_in vacuo_ will grow warm as much, and almost as soon as the Thermometer\r\nwhich is not _in vacuo_. And when the Vessels are carried back into the\r\ncold place, the Thermometer _in vacuo_ will grow cold almost as soon as\r\nthe other Thermometer. Is not the Heat of the warm Room convey'd through\r\nthe _Vacuum_ by the Vibrations of a much subtiler Medium than Air, which\r\nafter the Air was drawn out remained in the _Vacuum_? And is not this\r\nMedium the same with that Medium by which Light is refracted and\r\nreflected, and by whose Vibrations Light communicates Heat to Bodies,\r\nand is put into Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission? And do not\r\nthe Vibrations of this Medium in hot Bodies contribute to the\r\nintenseness and duration of their Heat? And do not hot Bodies\r\ncommunicate their Heat to contiguous cold ones, by the Vibrations of\r\nthis Medium propagated from them into the cold ones? And is not this\r\nMedium exceedingly more rare and subtile than the Air, and exceedingly\r\nmore elastick and active? And doth it not readily pervade all Bodies?\r\nAnd is it not (by its elastick force) expanded through all the Heavens?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 19. Doth not the Refraction of Light proceed from the different\r\ndensity of this AEthereal Medium in different places, the Light receding\r\nalways from the denser parts of the Medium? And is not the density\r\nthereof greater in free and open Spaces void of Air and other grosser\r\nBodies, than within the Pores of Water, Glass, Crystal, Gems, and other\r\ncompact Bodies? For when Light passes through Glass or Crystal, and\r\nfalling very obliquely upon the farther Surface thereof is totally\r\nreflected, the total Reflexion ought to proceed rather from the density\r\nand vigour of the Medium without and beyond the Glass, than from the\r\nrarity and weakness thereof.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 20. Doth not this AEthereal Medium in passing out of Water, Glass,\r\nCrystal, and other compact and dense Bodies into empty Spaces, grow\r\ndenser and denser by degrees, and by that means refract the Rays of\r\nLight not in a point, but by bending them gradually in curve Lines? And\r\ndoth not the gradual condensation of this Medium extend to some distance\r\nfrom the Bodies, and thereby cause the Inflexions of the Rays of Light,\r\nwhich pass by the edges of dense Bodies, at some distance from the\r\nBodies?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 21. Is not this Medium much rarer within the dense Bodies of the\r\nSun, Stars, Planets and Comets, than in the empty celestial Spaces\r\nbetween them? And in passing from them to great distances, doth it not\r\ngrow denser and denser perpetually, and thereby cause the gravity of\r\nthose great Bodies towards one another, and of their parts towards the\r\nBodies; every Body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the\r\nMedium towards the rarer? For if this Medium be rarer within the Sun's\r\nBody than at its Surface, and rarer there than at the hundredth part of\r\nan Inch from its Body, and rarer there than at the fiftieth part of an\r\nInch from its Body, and rarer there than at the Orb of _Saturn_; I see\r\nno reason why the Increase of density should stop any where, and not\r\nrather be continued through all distances from the Sun to _Saturn_, and\r\nbeyond. And though this Increase of density may at great distances be\r\nexceeding slow, yet if the elastick force of this Medium be exceeding\r\ngreat, it may suffice to impel Bodies from the denser parts of the\r\nMedium towards the rarer, with all that power which we call Gravity. And\r\nthat the elastick force of this Medium is exceeding great, may be\r\ngather'd from the swiftness of its Vibrations. Sounds move about 1140\r\n_English_ Feet in a second Minute of Time, and in seven or eight Minutes\r\nof Time they move about one hundred _English_ Miles. Light moves from\r\nthe Sun to us in about seven or eight Minutes of Time, which distance is\r\nabout 70,000,000 _English_ Miles, supposing the horizontal Parallax of\r\nthe Sun to be about 12''. And the Vibrations or Pulses of this Medium,\r\nthat they may cause the alternate Fits of easy Transmission and easy\r\nReflexion, must be swifter than Light, and by consequence above 700,000\r\ntimes swifter than Sounds. And therefore the elastick force of this\r\nMedium, in proportion to its density, must be above 700000 x 700000\r\n(that is, above 490,000,000,000) times greater than the elastick force\r\nof the Air is in proportion to its density. For the Velocities of the\r\nPulses of elastick Mediums are in a subduplicate _Ratio_ of the\r\nElasticities and the Rarities of the Mediums taken together.\r\n\r\nAs Attraction is stronger in small Magnets than in great ones in\r\nproportion to their Bulk, and Gravity is greater in the Surfaces of\r\nsmall Planets than in those of great ones in proportion to their bulk,\r\nand small Bodies are agitated much more by electric attraction than\r\ngreat ones; so the smallness of the Rays of Light may contribute very\r\nmuch to the power of the Agent by which they are refracted. And so if\r\nany one should suppose that _AEther_ (like our Air) may contain Particles\r\nwhich endeavour to recede from one another (for I do not know what this\r\n_AEther_ is) and that its Particles are exceedingly smaller than those of\r\nAir, or even than those of Light: The exceeding smallness of its\r\nParticles may contribute to the greatness of the force by which those\r\nParticles may recede from one another, and thereby make that Medium\r\nexceedingly more rare and elastick than Air, and by consequence\r\nexceedingly less able to resist the motions of Projectiles, and\r\nexceedingly more able to press upon gross Bodies, by endeavouring to\r\nexpand it self.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 22. May not Planets and Comets, and all gross Bodies, perform\r\ntheir Motions more freely, and with less resistance in this AEthereal\r\nMedium than in any Fluid, which fills all Space adequately without\r\nleaving any Pores, and by consequence is much denser than Quick-silver\r\nor Gold? And may not its resistance be so small, as to be\r\ninconsiderable? For instance; If this _AEther_ (for so I will call it)\r\nshould be supposed 700000 times more elastick than our Air, and above\r\n700000 times more rare; its resistance would be above 600,000,000 times\r\nless than that of Water. And so small a resistance would scarce make any\r\nsensible alteration in the Motions of the Planets in ten thousand\r\nYears. If any one would ask how a Medium can be so rare, let him tell me\r\nhow the Air, in the upper parts of the Atmosphere, can be above an\r\nhundred thousand thousand times rarer than Gold. Let him also tell me,\r\nhow an electrick Body can by Friction emit an Exhalation so rare and\r\nsubtile, and yet so potent, as by its Emission to cause no sensible\r\nDiminution of the weight of the electrick Body, and to be expanded\r\nthrough a Sphere, whose Diameter is above two Feet, and yet to be able\r\nto agitate and carry up Leaf Copper, or Leaf Gold, at the distance of\r\nabove a Foot from the electrick Body? And how the Effluvia of a Magnet\r\ncan be so rare and subtile, as to pass through a Plate of Glass without\r\nany Resistance or Diminution of their Force, and yet so potent as to\r\nturn a magnetick Needle beyond the Glass?\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 23. Is not Vision perform'd chiefly by the Vibrations of this\r\nMedium, excited in the bottom of the Eye by the Rays of Light, and\r\npropagated through the solid, pellucid and uniform Capillamenta of the\r\noptick Nerves into the place of Sensation? And is not Hearing perform'd\r\nby the Vibrations either of this or some other Medium, excited in the\r\nauditory Nerves by the Tremors of the Air, and propagated through the\r\nsolid, pellucid and uniform Capillamenta of those Nerves into the place\r\nof Sensation? And so of the other Senses.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 24. Is not Animal Motion perform'd by the Vibrations of this\r\nMedium, excited in the Brain by the power of the Will, and propagated\r\nfrom thence through the solid, pellucid and uniform Capillamenta of the\r\nNerves into the Muscles, for contracting and dilating them? I suppose\r\nthat the Capillamenta of the Nerves are each of them solid and uniform,\r\nthat the vibrating Motion of the AEthereal Medium may be propagated along\r\nthem from one end to the other uniformly, and without interruption: For\r\nObstructions in the Nerves create Palsies. And that they may be\r\nsufficiently uniform, I suppose them to be pellucid when view'd singly,\r\ntho' the Reflexions in their cylindrical Surfaces may make the whole\r\nNerve (composed of many Capillamenta) appear opake and white. For\r\nopacity arises from reflecting Surfaces, such as may disturb and\r\ninterrupt the Motions of this Medium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _See the following Scheme, p. 356._]\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 25. Are there not other original Properties of the Rays of Light,\r\nbesides those already described? An instance of another original\r\nProperty we have in the Refraction of Island Crystal, described first by\r\n_Erasmus Bartholine_, and afterwards more exactly by _Hugenius_, in his\r\nBook _De la Lumiere_. This Crystal is a pellucid fissile Stone, clear as\r\nWater or Crystal of the Rock, and without Colour; enduring a red Heat\r\nwithout losing its transparency, and in a very strong Heat calcining\r\nwithout Fusion. Steep'd a Day or two in Water, it loses its natural\r\nPolish. Being rubb'd on Cloth, it attracts pieces of Straws and other\r\nlight things, like Ambar or Glass; and with _Aqua fortis_ it makes an\r\nEbullition. It seems to be a sort of Talk, and is found in form of an\r\noblique Parallelopiped, with six parallelogram Sides and eight solid\r\nAngles. The obtuse Angles of the Parallelograms are each of them 101\r\nDegrees and 52 Minutes; the acute ones 78 Degrees and 8 Minutes. Two of\r\nthe solid Angles opposite to one another, as C and E, are compassed each\r\nof them with three of these obtuse Angles, and each of the other six\r\nwith one obtuse and two acute ones. It cleaves easily in planes parallel\r\nto any of its Sides, and not in any other Planes. It cleaves with a\r\nglossy polite Surface not perfectly plane, but with some little\r\nunevenness. It is easily scratch'd, and by reason of its softness it\r\ntakes a Polish very difficultly. It polishes better upon polish'd\r\nLooking-glass than upon Metal, and perhaps better upon Pitch, Leather or\r\nParchment. Afterwards it must be rubb'd with a little Oil or white of an\r\nEgg, to fill up its Scratches; whereby it will become very transparent\r\nand polite. But for several Experiments, it is not necessary to polish\r\nit. If a piece of this crystalline Stone be laid upon a Book, every\r\nLetter of the Book seen through it will appear double, by means of a\r\ndouble Refraction. And if any beam of Light falls either\r\nperpendicularly, or in any oblique Angle upon any Surface of this\r\nCrystal, it becomes divided into two beams by means of the same double\r\nRefraction. Which beams are of the same Colour with the incident beam of\r\nLight, and seem equal to one another in the quantity of their Light, or\r\nvery nearly equal. One of these Refractions is perform'd by the usual\r\nRule of Opticks, the Sine of Incidence out of Air into this Crystal\r\nbeing to the Sine of Refraction, as five to three. The other\r\nRefraction, which may be called the unusual Refraction, is perform'd by\r\nthe following Rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nLet ADBC represent the refracting Surface of the Crystal, C the biggest\r\nsolid Angle at that Surface, GEHF the opposite Surface, and CK a\r\nperpendicular on that Surface. This perpendicular makes with the edge of\r\nthe Crystal CF, an Angle of 19 Degr. 3'. Join KF, and in it take KL, so\r\nthat the Angle KCL be 6 Degr. 40'. and the Angle LCF 12 Degr. 23'. And\r\nif ST represent any beam of Light incident at T in any Angle upon the\r\nrefracting Surface ADBC, let TV be the refracted beam determin'd by the\r\ngiven Portion of the Sines 5 to 3, according to the usual Rule of\r\nOpticks. Draw VX parallel and equal to KL. Draw it the same way from V\r\nin which L lieth from K; and joining TX, this line TX shall be the other\r\nrefracted beam carried from T to X, by the unusual Refraction.\r\n\r\nIf therefore the incident beam ST be perpendicular to the refracting\r\nSurface, the two beams TV and TX, into which it shall become divided,\r\nshall be parallel to the lines CK and CL; one of those beams going\r\nthrough the Crystal perpendicularly, as it ought to do by the usual Laws\r\nof Opticks, and the other TX by an unusual Refraction diverging from the\r\nperpendicular, and making with it an Angle VTX of about 6-2/3 Degrees,\r\nas is found by Experience. And hence, the Plane VTX, and such like\r\nPlanes which are parallel to the Plane CFK, may be called the Planes of\r\nperpendicular Refraction. And the Coast towards which the lines KL and\r\nVX are drawn, may be call'd the Coast of unusual Refraction.\r\n\r\nIn like manner Crystal of the Rock has a double Refraction: But the\r\ndifference of the two Refractions is not so great and manifest as in\r\nIsland Crystal.\r\n\r\nWhen the beam ST incident on Island Crystal is divided into two beams TV\r\nand TX, and these two beams arrive at the farther Surface of the Glass;\r\nthe beam TV, which was refracted at the first Surface after the usual\r\nmanner, shall be again refracted entirely after the usual manner at the\r\nsecond Surface; and the beam TX, which was refracted after the unusual\r\nmanner in the first Surface, shall be again refracted entirely after the\r\nunusual manner in the second Surface; so that both these beams shall\r\nemerge out of the second Surface in lines parallel to the first incident\r\nbeam ST.\r\n\r\nAnd if two pieces of Island Crystal be placed one after another, in such\r\nmanner that all the Surfaces of the latter be parallel to all the\r\ncorresponding Surfaces of the former: The Rays which are refracted after\r\nthe usual manner in the first Surface of the first Crystal, shall be\r\nrefracted after the usual manner in all the following Surfaces; and the\r\nRays which are refracted after the unusual manner in the first Surface,\r\nshall be refracted after the unusual manner in all the following\r\nSurfaces. And the same thing happens, though the Surfaces of the\r\nCrystals be any ways inclined to one another, provided that their Planes\r\nof perpendicular Refraction be parallel to one another.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore there is an original difference in the Rays of Light, by\r\nmeans of which some Rays are in this Experiment constantly refracted\r\nafter the usual manner, and others constantly after the unusual manner:\r\nFor if the difference be not original, but arises from new Modifications\r\nimpress'd on the Rays at their first Refraction, it would be alter'd by\r\nnew Modifications in the three following Refractions; whereas it suffers\r\nno alteration, but is constant, and has the same effect upon the Rays in\r\nall the Refractions. The unusual Refraction is therefore perform'd by an\r\noriginal property of the Rays. And it remains to be enquired, whether\r\nthe Rays have not more original Properties than are yet discover'd.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 26. Have not the Rays of Light several sides, endued with several\r\noriginal Properties? For if the Planes of perpendicular Refraction of\r\nthe second Crystal be at right Angles with the Planes of perpendicular\r\nRefraction of the first Crystal, the Rays which are refracted after the\r\nusual manner in passing through the first Crystal, will be all of them\r\nrefracted after the unusual manner in passing through the second\r\nCrystal; and the Rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in\r\npassing through the first Crystal, will be all of them refracted after\r\nthe usual manner in passing through the second Crystal. And therefore\r\nthere are not two sorts of Rays differing in their nature from one\r\nanother, one of which is constantly and in all Positions refracted after\r\nthe usual manner, and the other constantly and in all Positions after\r\nthe unusual manner. The difference between the two sorts of Rays in the\r\nExperiment mention'd in the 25th Question, was only in the Positions of\r\nthe Sides of the Rays to the Planes of perpendicular Refraction. For one\r\nand the same Ray is here refracted sometimes after the usual, and\r\nsometimes after the unusual manner, according to the Position which its\r\nSides have to the Crystals. If the Sides of the Ray are posited the same\r\nway to both Crystals, it is refracted after the same manner in them\r\nboth: But if that side of the Ray which looks towards the Coast of the\r\nunusual Refraction of the first Crystal, be 90 Degrees from that side of\r\nthe same Ray which looks toward the Coast of the unusual Refraction of\r\nthe second Crystal, (which may be effected by varying the Position of\r\nthe second Crystal to the first, and by consequence to the Rays of\r\nLight,) the Ray shall be refracted after several manners in the several\r\nCrystals. There is nothing more required to determine whether the Rays\r\nof Light which fall upon the second Crystal shall be refracted after\r\nthe usual or after the unusual manner, but to turn about this Crystal,\r\nso that the Coast of this Crystal's unusual Refraction may be on this or\r\non that side of the Ray. And therefore every Ray may be consider'd as\r\nhaving four Sides or Quarters, two of which opposite to one another\r\nincline the Ray to be refracted after the unusual manner, as often as\r\neither of them are turn'd towards the Coast of unusual Refraction; and\r\nthe other two, whenever either of them are turn'd towards the Coast of\r\nunusual Refraction, do not incline it to be otherwise refracted than\r\nafter the usual manner. The two first may therefore be call'd the Sides\r\nof unusual Refraction. And since these Dispositions were in the Rays\r\nbefore their Incidence on the second, third, and fourth Surfaces of the\r\ntwo Crystals, and suffered no alteration (so far as appears,) by the\r\nRefraction of the Rays in their passage through those Surfaces, and the\r\nRays were refracted by the same Laws in all the four Surfaces; it\r\nappears that those Dispositions were in the Rays originally, and\r\nsuffer'd no alteration by the first Refraction, and that by means of\r\nthose Dispositions the Rays were refracted at their Incidence on the\r\nfirst Surface of the first Crystal, some of them after the usual, and\r\nsome of them after the unusual manner, accordingly as their Sides of\r\nunusual Refraction were then turn'd towards the Coast of the unusual\r\nRefraction of that Crystal, or sideways from it.\r\n\r\nEvery Ray of Light has therefore two opposite Sides, originally endued\r\nwith a Property on which the unusual Refraction depends, and the other\r\ntwo opposite Sides not endued with that Property. And it remains to be\r\nenquired, whether there are not more Properties of Light by which the\r\nSides of the Rays differ, and are distinguished from one another.\r\n\r\nIn explaining the difference of the Sides of the Rays above mention'd, I\r\nhave supposed that the Rays fall perpendicularly on the first Crystal.\r\nBut if they fall obliquely on it, the Success is the same. Those Rays\r\nwhich are refracted after the usual manner in the first Crystal, will be\r\nrefracted after the unusual manner in the second Crystal, supposing the\r\nPlanes of perpendicular Refraction to be at right Angles with one\r\nanother, as above; and on the contrary.\r\n\r\nIf the Planes of the perpendicular Refraction of the two Crystals be\r\nneither parallel nor perpendicular to one another, but contain an acute\r\nAngle: The two beams of Light which emerge out of the first Crystal,\r\nwill be each of them divided into two more at their Incidence on the\r\nsecond Crystal. For in this case the Rays in each of the two beams will\r\nsome of them have their Sides of unusual Refraction, and some of them\r\ntheir other Sides turn'd towards the Coast of the unusual Refraction of\r\nthe second Crystal.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 27. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous which have hitherto been\r\ninvented for explaining the Phaenomena of Light, by new Modifications of\r\nthe Rays? For those Phaenomena depend not upon new Modifications, as has\r\nbeen supposed, but upon the original and unchangeable Properties of the\r\nRays.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 28. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous, in which Light is supposed\r\nto consist in Pression or Motion, propagated through a fluid Medium? For\r\nin all these Hypotheses the Phaenomena of Light have been hitherto\r\nexplain'd by supposing that they arise from new Modifications of the\r\nRays; which is an erroneous Supposition.\r\n\r\nIf Light consisted only in Pression propagated without actual Motion, it\r\nwould not be able to agitate and heat the Bodies which refract and\r\nreflect it. If it consisted in Motion propagated to all distances in an\r\ninstant, it would require an infinite force every moment, in every\r\nshining Particle, to generate that Motion. And if it consisted in\r\nPression or Motion, propagated either in an instant or in time, it would\r\nbend into the Shadow. For Pression or Motion cannot be propagated in a\r\nFluid in right Lines, beyond an Obstacle which stops part of the Motion,\r\nbut will bend and spread every way into the quiescent Medium which lies\r\nbeyond the Obstacle. Gravity tends downwards, but the Pressure of Water\r\narising from Gravity tends every way with equal Force, and is propagated\r\nas readily, and with as much force sideways as downwards, and through\r\ncrooked passages as through strait ones. The Waves on the Surface of\r\nstagnating Water, passing by the sides of a broad Obstacle which stops\r\npart of them, bend afterwards and dilate themselves gradually into the\r\nquiet Water behind the Obstacle. The Waves, Pulses or Vibrations of the\r\nAir, wherein Sounds consist, bend manifestly, though not so much as the\r\nWaves of Water. For a Bell or a Cannon may be heard beyond a Hill which\r\nintercepts the sight of the sounding Body, and Sounds are propagated as\r\nreadily through crooked Pipes as through streight ones. But Light is\r\nnever known to follow crooked Passages nor to bend into the Shadow. For\r\nthe fix'd Stars by the Interposition of any of the Planets cease to be\r\nseen. And so do the Parts of the Sun by the Interposition of the Moon,\r\n_Mercury_ or _Venus_. The Rays which pass very near to the edges of any\r\nBody, are bent a little by the action of the Body, as we shew'd above;\r\nbut this bending is not towards but from the Shadow, and is perform'd\r\nonly in the passage of the Ray by the Body, and at a very small distance\r\nfrom it. So soon as the Ray is past the Body, it goes right on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mais pour dire comment cela se fait, je n'ay rien trove\r\njusqu' ici qui me satisfasse._ C. H. de la lumiere, c. 5, p. 91.]\r\n\r\nTo explain the unusual Refraction of Island Crystal by Pression or\r\nMotion propagated, has not hitherto been attempted (to my knowledge)\r\nexcept by _Huygens_, who for that end supposed two several vibrating\r\nMediums within that Crystal. But when he tried the Refractions in two\r\nsuccessive pieces of that Crystal, and found them such as is mention'd\r\nabove; he confessed himself at a loss for explaining them. For Pressions\r\nor Motions, propagated from a shining Body through an uniform Medium,\r\nmust be on all sides alike; whereas by those Experiments it appears,\r\nthat the Rays of Light have different Properties in their different\r\nSides. He suspected that the Pulses of _AEther_ in passing through the\r\nfirst Crystal might receive certain new Modifications, which might\r\ndetermine them to be propagated in this or that Medium within the\r\nsecond Crystal, according to the Position of that Crystal. But what\r\nModifications those might be he could not say, nor think of any thing\r\nsatisfactory in that Point. And if he had known that the unusual\r\nRefraction depends not on new Modifications, but on the original and\r\nunchangeable Dispositions of the Rays, he would have found it as\r\ndifficult to explain how those Dispositions which he supposed to be\r\nimpress'd on the Rays by the first Crystal, could be in them before\r\ntheir Incidence on that Crystal, and in general, how all Rays emitted by\r\nshining Bodies, can have those Dispositions in them from the beginning.\r\nTo me, at least, this seems inexplicable, if Light be nothing else than\r\nPression or Motion propagated through _AEther_.\r\n\r\nAnd it is as difficult to explain by these Hypotheses, how Rays can be\r\nalternately in Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission; unless\r\nperhaps one might suppose that there are in all Space two AEthereal\r\nvibrating Mediums, and that the Vibrations of one of them constitute\r\nLight, and the Vibrations of the other are swifter, and as often as they\r\novertake the Vibrations of the first, put them into those Fits. But how\r\ntwo _AEthers_ can be diffused through all Space, one of which acts upon\r\nthe other, and by consequence is re-acted upon, without retarding,\r\nshattering, dispersing and confounding one anothers Motions, is\r\ninconceivable. And against filling the Heavens with fluid Mediums,\r\nunless they be exceeding rare, a great Objection arises from the regular\r\nand very lasting Motions of the Planets and Comets in all manner of\r\nCourses through the Heavens. For thence it is manifest, that the Heavens\r\nare void of all sensible Resistance, and by consequence of all sensible\r\nMatter.\r\n\r\nFor the resisting Power of fluid Mediums arises partly from the\r\nAttrition of the Parts of the Medium, and partly from the _Vis inertiae_\r\nof the Matter. That part of the Resistance of a spherical Body which\r\narises from the Attrition of the Parts of the Medium is very nearly as\r\nthe Diameter, or, at the most, as the _Factum_ of the Diameter, and the\r\nVelocity of the spherical Body together. And that part of the Resistance\r\nwhich arises from the _Vis inertiae_ of the Matter, is as the Square of\r\nthat _Factum_. And by this difference the two sorts of Resistance may be\r\ndistinguish'd from one another in any Medium; and these being\r\ndistinguish'd, it will be found that almost all the Resistance of Bodies\r\nof a competent Magnitude moving in Air, Water, Quick-silver, and such\r\nlike Fluids with a competent Velocity, arises from the _Vis inertiae_ of\r\nthe Parts of the Fluid.\r\n\r\nNow that part of the resisting Power of any Medium which arises from the\r\nTenacity, Friction or Attrition of the Parts of the Medium, may be\r\ndiminish'd by dividing the Matter into smaller Parts, and making the\r\nParts more smooth and slippery: But that part of the Resistance which\r\narises from the _Vis inertiae_, is proportional to the Density of the\r\nMatter, and cannot be diminish'd by dividing the Matter into smaller\r\nParts, nor by any other means than by decreasing the Density of the\r\nMedium. And for these Reasons the Density of fluid Mediums is very\r\nnearly proportional to their Resistance. Liquors which differ not much\r\nin Density, as Water, Spirit of Wine, Spirit of Turpentine, hot Oil,\r\ndiffer not much in Resistance. Water is thirteen or fourteen times\r\nlighter than Quick-silver and by consequence thirteen or fourteen times\r\nrarer, and its Resistance is less than that of Quick-silver in the same\r\nProportion, or thereabouts, as I have found by Experiments made with\r\nPendulums. The open Air in which we breathe is eight or nine hundred\r\ntimes lighter than Water, and by consequence eight or nine hundred times\r\nrarer, and accordingly its Resistance is less than that of Water in the\r\nsame Proportion, or thereabouts; as I have also found by Experiments\r\nmade with Pendulums. And in thinner Air the Resistance is still less,\r\nand at length, by ratifying the Air, becomes insensible. For small\r\nFeathers falling in the open Air meet with great Resistance, but in a\r\ntall Glass well emptied of Air, they fall as fast as Lead or Gold, as I\r\nhave seen tried several times. Whence the Resistance seems still to\r\ndecrease in proportion to the Density of the Fluid. For I do not find by\r\nany Experiments, that Bodies moving in Quick-silver, Water or Air, meet\r\nwith any other sensible Resistance than what arises from the Density and\r\nTenacity of those sensible Fluids, as they would do if the Pores of\r\nthose Fluids, and all other Spaces, were filled with a dense and\r\nsubtile Fluid. Now if the Resistance in a Vessel well emptied of Air,\r\nwas but an hundred times less than in the open Air, it would be about a\r\nmillion of times less than in Quick-silver. But it seems to be much less\r\nin such a Vessel, and still much less in the Heavens, at the height of\r\nthree or four hundred Miles from the Earth, or above. For Mr. _Boyle_\r\nhas shew'd that Air may be rarified above ten thousand times in Vessels\r\nof Glass; and the Heavens are much emptier of Air than any _Vacuum_ we\r\ncan make below. For since the Air is compress'd by the Weight of the\r\nincumbent Atmosphere, and the Density of Air is proportional to the\r\nForce compressing it, it follows by Computation, that at the height of\r\nabout seven and a half _English_ Miles from the Earth, the Air is four\r\ntimes rarer than at the Surface of the Earth; and at the height of 15\r\nMiles it is sixteen times rarer than that at the Surface of the Earth;\r\nand at the height of 22-1/2, 30, or 38 Miles, it is respectively 64,\r\n256, or 1024 times rarer, or thereabouts; and at the height of 76, 152,\r\n228 Miles, it is about 1000000, 1000000000000, or 1000000000000000000\r\ntimes rarer; and so on.\r\n\r\nHeat promotes Fluidity very much by diminishing the Tenacity of Bodies.\r\nIt makes many Bodies fluid which are not fluid in cold, and increases\r\nthe Fluidity of tenacious Liquids, as of Oil, Balsam, and Honey, and\r\nthereby decreases their Resistance. But it decreases not the Resistance\r\nof Water considerably, as it would do if any considerable part of the\r\nResistance of Water arose from the Attrition or Tenacity of its Parts.\r\nAnd therefore the Resistance of Water arises principally and almost\r\nentirely from the _Vis inertiae_ of its Matter; and by consequence, if\r\nthe Heavens were as dense as Water, they would not have much less\r\nResistance than Water; if as dense as Quick-silver, they would not have\r\nmuch less Resistance than Quick-silver; if absolutely dense, or full of\r\nMatter without any _Vacuum_, let the Matter be never so subtil and\r\nfluid, they would have a greater Resistance than Quick-silver. A solid\r\nGlobe in such a Medium would lose above half its Motion in moving three\r\ntimes the length of its Diameter, and a Globe not solid (such as are the\r\nPlanets,) would be retarded sooner. And therefore to make way for the\r\nregular and lasting Motions of the Planets and Comets, it's necessary to\r\nempty the Heavens of all Matter, except perhaps some very thin Vapours,\r\nSteams, or Effluvia, arising from the Atmospheres of the Earth, Planets,\r\nand Comets, and from such an exceedingly rare AEthereal Medium as we\r\ndescribed above. A dense Fluid can be of no use for explaining the\r\nPhaenomena of Nature, the Motions of the Planets and Comets being better\r\nexplain'd without it. It serves only to disturb and retard the Motions\r\nof those great Bodies, and make the Frame of Nature languish: And in the\r\nPores of Bodies, it serves only to stop the vibrating Motions of their\r\nParts, wherein their Heat and Activity consists. And as it is of no use,\r\nand hinders the Operations of Nature, and makes her languish, so there\r\nis no evidence for its Existence, and therefore it ought to be rejected.\r\nAnd if it be rejected, the Hypotheses that Light consists in Pression\r\nor Motion, propagated through such a Medium, are rejected with it.\r\n\r\nAnd for rejecting such a Medium, we have the Authority of those the\r\noldest and most celebrated Philosophers of _Greece_ and _Phoenicia_,\r\nwho made a _Vacuum_, and Atoms, and the Gravity of Atoms, the first\r\nPrinciples of their Philosophy; tacitly attributing Gravity to some\r\nother Cause than dense Matter. Later Philosophers banish the\r\nConsideration of such a Cause out of natural Philosophy, feigning\r\nHypotheses for explaining all things mechanically, and referring other\r\nCauses to Metaphysicks: Whereas the main Business of natural Philosophy\r\nis to argue from Phaenomena without feigning Hypotheses, and to deduce\r\nCauses from Effects, till we come to the very first Cause, which\r\ncertainly is not mechanical; and not only to unfold the Mechanism of the\r\nWorld, but chiefly to resolve these and such like Questions. What is\r\nthere in places almost empty of Matter, and whence is it that the Sun\r\nand Planets gravitate towards one another, without dense Matter between\r\nthem? Whence is it that Nature doth nothing in vain; and whence arises\r\nall that Order and Beauty which we see in the World? To what end are\r\nComets, and whence is it that Planets move all one and the same way in\r\nOrbs concentrick, while Comets move all manner of ways in Orbs very\r\nexcentrick; and what hinders the fix'd Stars from falling upon one\r\nanother? How came the Bodies of Animals to be contrived with so much\r\nArt, and for what ends were their several Parts? Was the Eye contrived\r\nwithout Skill in Opticks, and the Ear without Knowledge of Sounds? How\r\ndo the Motions of the Body follow from the Will, and whence is the\r\nInstinct in Animals? Is not the Sensory of Animals that place to which\r\nthe sensitive Substance is present, and into which the sensible Species\r\nof Things are carried through the Nerves and Brain, that there they may\r\nbe perceived by their immediate presence to that Substance? And these\r\nthings being rightly dispatch'd, does it not appear from Phaenomena that\r\nthere is a Being incorporeal, living, intelligent, omnipresent, who in\r\ninfinite Space, as it were in his Sensory, sees the things themselves\r\nintimately, and throughly perceives them, and comprehends them wholly by\r\ntheir immediate presence to himself: Of which things the Images only\r\ncarried through the Organs of Sense into our little Sensoriums, are\r\nthere seen and beheld by that which in us perceives and thinks. And\r\nthough every true Step made in this Philosophy brings us not immediately\r\nto the Knowledge of the first Cause, yet it brings us nearer to it, and\r\non that account is to be highly valued.\r\n\r\n_Qu._ 29. Are not the Rays of Light very small Bodies emitted from\r\nshining Substances? For such Bodies will pass through uniform Mediums in\r\nright Lines without bending into the Shadow, which is the Nature of the\r\nRays of Light. They will also be capable of several Properties, and be\r\nable to conserve their Properties unchanged in passing through several\r\nMediums, which is another Condition of the Rays of Light. Pellucid\r\nSubstances act upon the Rays of Light at a distance in refracting,\r\nreflecting, and inflecting them, and the Rays mutually agitate the Parts\r\nof those Substances at a distance for heating them; and this Action and\r\nRe-action at a distance very much resembles an attractive Force between\r\nBodies. If Refraction be perform'd by Attraction of the Rays, the Sines\r\nof Incidence must be to the Sines of Refraction in a given Proportion,\r\nas we shew'd in our Principles of Philosophy: And this Rule is true by\r\nExperience. The Rays of Light in going out of Glass into a _Vacuum_, are\r\nbent towards the Glass; and if they fall too obliquely on the _Vacuum_,\r\nthey are bent backwards into the Glass, and totally reflected; and this\r\nReflexion cannot be ascribed to the Resistance of an absolute _Vacuum_,\r\nbut must be caused by the Power of the Glass attracting the Rays at\r\ntheir going out of it into the _Vacuum_, and bringing them back. For if\r\nthe farther Surface of the Glass be moisten'd with Water or clear Oil,\r\nor liquid and clear Honey, the Rays which would otherwise be reflected\r\nwill go into the Water, Oil, or Honey; and therefore are not reflected\r\nbefore they arrive at the farther Surface of the Glass, and begin to go\r\nout of it. If they go out of it into the Water, Oil, or Honey, they go\r\non, because the Attraction of the Glass is almost balanced and rendered\r\nineffectual by the contrary Attraction of the Liquor. But if they go out\r\nof it into a _Vacuum_ which has no Attraction to balance that of the\r\nGlass, the Attraction of the Glass either bends and refracts them, or\r\nbrings them back and reflects them. And this is still more evident by\r\nlaying together two Prisms of Glass, or two Object-glasses of very long\r\nTelescopes, the one plane, the other a little convex, and so compressing\r\nthem that they do not fully touch, nor are too far asunder. For the\r\nLight which falls upon the farther Surface of the first Glass where the\r\nInterval between the Glasses is not above the ten hundred thousandth\r\nPart of an Inch, will go through that Surface, and through the Air or\r\n_Vacuum_ between the Glasses, and enter into the second Glass, as was\r\nexplain'd in the first, fourth, and eighth Observations of the first\r\nPart of the second Book. But, if the second Glass be taken away, the\r\nLight which goes out of the second Surface of the first Glass into the\r\nAir or _Vacuum_, will not go on forwards, but turns back into the first\r\nGlass, and is reflected; and therefore it is drawn back by the Power of\r\nthe first Glass, there being nothing else to turn it back. Nothing more\r\nis requisite for producing all the variety of Colours, and degrees of\r\nRefrangibility, than that the Rays of Light be Bodies of different\r\nSizes, the least of which may take violet the weakest and darkest of the\r\nColours, and be more easily diverted by refracting Surfaces from the\r\nright Course; and the rest as they are bigger and bigger, may make the\r\nstronger and more lucid Colours, blue, green, yellow, and red, and be\r\nmore and more difficultly diverted. Nothing more is requisite for\r\nputting the Rays of Light into Fits of easy Reflexion and easy\r\nTransmission, than that they be small Bodies which by their attractive\r\nPowers, or some other Force, stir up Vibrations in what they act upon,\r\nwhich Vibrations being swifter than the Rays, overtake them\r\nsuccessively, and agitate them so as by turns to increase and decrease\r\ntheir Velocities, and thereby put them into those Fits. And lastly, the\r\nunusual Refraction of Island-Crystal looks very much as if it were\r\nperform'd by some kind of attractive virtue lodged in certain Sides both\r\nof the Rays, and of the Particles of the Crystal. For were it not for\r\nsome kind of Disposition or Virtue lodged in some Sides of the Particles\r\nof the Crystal, and not in their other Sides, and which inclines and\r\nbends the Rays towards the Coast of unusual Refraction, the Rays which\r\nfall perpendicularly on the Crystal, would not be refracted towards that\r\nCoast rather than towards any other Coast, both at their Incidence and\r\nat their Emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly by a contrary\r\nSituation of the Coast of unusual Refraction at the second Surface; the\r\nCrystal acting upon the Rays after they have pass'd through it, and are\r\nemerging into the Air; or, if you please, into a _Vacuum_. And since the\r\nCrystal by this Disposition or Virtue does not act upon the Rays, unless\r\nwhen one of their Sides of unusual Refraction looks towards that Coast,\r\nthis argues a Virtue or Disposition in those Sides of the Rays, which\r\nanswers to, and sympathizes with that Virtue or Disposition of the\r\nCrystal, as the Poles of two Magnets answer to one another. And as\r\nMagnetism may be intended and remitted, and is found only in the Magnet\r\nand in Iron: So this Virtue of refracting the perpendicular Rays is\r\ngreater in Island-Crystal, less in Crystal of the Rock, and is not yet\r\nfound in other Bodies. I do not say that this Virtue is magnetical: It\r\nseems to be of another kind. I only say, that whatever it be, it's\r\ndifficult to conceive how the Rays of Light, unless they be Bodies, can\r\nhave a permanent Virtue in two of their Sides which is not in their\r\nother Sides, and this without any regard to their Position to the Space\r\nor Medium through which they pass.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean in this Question by a _Vacuum_, and by the Attractions of\r\nthe Rays of Light towards Glass or Crystal, may be understood by what\r\nwas said in the 18th, 19th, and 20th Questions.\r\n\r\n_Quest._ 30. Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one\r\nanother, and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the\r\nParticles of Light which enter their Composition? For all fix'd Bodies\r\nbeing heated emit Light so long as they continue sufficiently hot, and\r\nLight mutually stops in Bodies as often as its Rays strike upon their\r\nParts, as we shew'd above. I know no Body less apt to shine than Water;\r\nand yet Water by frequent Distillations changes into fix'd Earth, as Mr.\r\n_Boyle_ has try'd; and then this Earth being enabled to endure a\r\nsufficient Heat, shines by Heat like other Bodies.\r\n\r\nThe changing of Bodies into Light, and Light into Bodies, is very\r\nconformable to the Course of Nature, which seems delighted with\r\nTransmutations. Water, which is a very fluid tasteless Salt, she changes\r\nby Heat into Vapour, which is a sort of Air, and by Cold into Ice, which\r\nis a hard, pellucid, brittle, fusible Stone; and this Stone returns into\r\nWater by Heat, and Vapour returns into Water by Cold. Earth by Heat\r\nbecomes Fire, and by Cold returns into Earth. Dense Bodies by\r\nFermentation rarify into several sorts of Air, and this Air by\r\nFermentation, and sometimes without it, returns into dense Bodies.\r\nMercury appears sometimes in the form of a fluid Metal, sometimes in the\r\nform of a hard brittle Metal, sometimes in the form of a corrosive\r\npellucid Salt call'd Sublimate, sometimes in the form of a tasteless,\r\npellucid, volatile white Earth, call'd _Mercurius Dulcis_; or in that of\r\na red opake volatile Earth, call'd Cinnaber; or in that of a red or\r\nwhite Precipitate, or in that of a fluid Salt; and in Distillation it\r\nturns into Vapour, and being agitated _in Vacuo_, it shines like Fire.\r\nAnd after all these Changes it returns again into its first form of\r\nMercury. Eggs grow from insensible Magnitudes, and change into Animals;\r\nTadpoles into Frogs; and Worms into Flies. All Birds, Beasts and Fishes,\r\nInsects, Trees, and other Vegetables, with their several Parts, grow out\r\nof Water and watry Tinctures and Salts, and by Putrefaction return again\r\ninto watry Substances. And Water standing a few Days in the open Air,\r\nyields a Tincture, which (like that of Malt) by standing longer yields a\r\nSediment and a Spirit, but before Putrefaction is fit Nourishment for\r\nAnimals and Vegetables. And among such various and strange\r\nTransmutations, why may not Nature change Bodies into Light, and Light\r\ninto Bodies?\r\n\r\n_Quest._ 31. Have not the small Particles of Bodies certain Powers,\r\nVirtues, or Forces, by which they act at a distance, not only upon the\r\nRays of Light for reflecting, refracting, and inflecting them, but also\r\nupon one another for producing a great Part of the Phaenomena of Nature?\r\nFor it's well known, that Bodies act one upon another by the Attractions\r\nof Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity; and these Instances shew the\r\nTenor and Course of Nature, and make it not improbable but that there\r\nmay be more attractive Powers than these. For Nature is very consonant\r\nand conformable to her self. How these Attractions may be perform'd, I\r\ndo not here consider. What I call Attraction may be perform'd by\r\nimpulse, or by some other means unknown to me. I use that Word here to\r\nsignify only in general any Force by which Bodies tend towards one\r\nanother, whatsoever be the Cause. For we must learn from the Phaenomena\r\nof Nature what Bodies attract one another, and what are the Laws and\r\nProperties of the Attraction, before we enquire the Cause by which the\r\nAttraction is perform'd. The Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and\r\nElectricity, reach to very sensible distances, and so have been observed\r\nby vulgar Eyes, and there may be others which reach to so small\r\ndistances as hitherto escape Observation; and perhaps electrical\r\nAttraction may reach to such small distances, even without being excited\r\nby Friction.\r\n\r\nFor when Salt of Tartar runs _per Deliquium_, is not this done by an\r\nAttraction between the Particles of the Salt of Tartar, and the\r\nParticles of the Water which float in the Air in the form of Vapours?\r\nAnd why does not common Salt, or Salt-petre, or Vitriol, run _per\r\nDeliquium_, but for want of such an Attraction? Or why does not Salt of\r\nTartar draw more Water out of the Air than in a certain Proportion to\r\nits quantity, but for want of an attractive Force after it is satiated\r\nwith Water? And whence is it but from this attractive Power that Water\r\nwhich alone distils with a gentle luke-warm Heat, will not distil from\r\nSalt of Tartar without a great Heat? And is it not from the like\r\nattractive Power between the Particles of Oil of Vitriol and the\r\nParticles of Water, that Oil of Vitriol draws to it a good quantity of\r\nWater out of the Air, and after it is satiated draws no more, and in\r\nDistillation lets go the Water very difficultly? And when Water and Oil\r\nof Vitriol poured successively into the same Vessel grow very hot in the\r\nmixing, does not this Heat argue a great Motion in the Parts of the\r\nLiquors? And does not this Motion argue, that the Parts of the two\r\nLiquors in mixing coalesce with Violence, and by consequence rush\r\ntowards one another with an accelerated Motion? And when _Aqua fortis_,\r\nor Spirit of Vitriol poured upon Filings of Iron dissolves the Filings\r\nwith a great Heat and Ebullition, is not this Heat and Ebullition\r\neffected by a violent Motion of the Parts, and does not that Motion\r\nargue that the acid Parts of the Liquor rush towards the Parts of the\r\nMetal with violence, and run forcibly into its Pores till they get\r\nbetween its outmost Particles, and the main Mass of the Metal, and\r\nsurrounding those Particles loosen them from the main Mass, and set them\r\nat liberty to float off into the Water? And when the acid Particles,\r\nwhich alone would distil with an easy Heat, will not separate from the\r\nParticles of the Metal without a very violent Heat, does not this\r\nconfirm the Attraction between them?\r\n\r\nWhen Spirit of Vitriol poured upon common Salt or Salt-petre makes an\r\nEbullition with the Salt, and unites with it, and in Distillation the\r\nSpirit of the common Salt or Salt-petre comes over much easier than it\r\nwould do before, and the acid part of the Spirit of Vitriol stays\r\nbehind; does not this argue that the fix'd Alcaly of the Salt attracts\r\nthe acid Spirit of the Vitriol more strongly than its own Spirit, and\r\nnot being able to hold them both, lets go its own? And when Oil of\r\nVitriol is drawn off from its weight of Nitre, and from both the\r\nIngredients a compound Spirit of Nitre is distilled, and two parts of\r\nthis Spirit are poured on one part of Oil of Cloves or Carraway Seeds,\r\nor of any ponderous Oil of vegetable or animal Substances, or Oil of\r\nTurpentine thicken'd with a little Balsam of Sulphur, and the Liquors\r\ngrow so very hot in mixing, as presently to send up a burning Flame;\r\ndoes not this very great and sudden Heat argue that the two Liquors mix\r\nwith violence, and that their Parts in mixing run towards one another\r\nwith an accelerated Motion, and clash with the greatest Force? And is it\r\nnot for the same reason that well rectified Spirit of Wine poured on the\r\nsame compound Spirit flashes; and that the _Pulvis fulminans_, composed\r\nof Sulphur, Nitre, and Salt of Tartar, goes off with a more sudden and\r\nviolent Explosion than Gun-powder, the acid Spirits of the Sulphur and\r\nNitre rushing towards one another, and towards the Salt of Tartar, with\r\nso great a violence, as by the shock to turn the whole at once into\r\nVapour and Flame? Where the Dissolution is slow, it makes a slow\r\nEbullition and a gentle Heat; and where it is quicker, it makes a\r\ngreater Ebullition with more heat; and where it is done at once, the\r\nEbullition is contracted into a sudden Blast or violent Explosion, with\r\na heat equal to that of Fire and Flame. So when a Drachm of the\r\nabove-mention'd compound Spirit of Nitre was poured upon half a Drachm\r\nof Oil of Carraway Seeds _in vacuo_, the Mixture immediately made a\r\nflash like Gun-powder, and burst the exhausted Receiver, which was a\r\nGlass six Inches wide, and eight Inches deep. And even the gross Body of\r\nSulphur powder'd, and with an equal weight of Iron Filings and a little\r\nWater made into Paste, acts upon the Iron, and in five or six hours\r\ngrows too hot to be touch'd, and emits a Flame. And by these Experiments\r\ncompared with the great quantity of Sulphur with which the Earth\r\nabounds, and the warmth of the interior Parts of the Earth, and hot\r\nSprings, and burning Mountains, and with Damps, mineral Coruscations,\r\nEarthquakes, hot suffocating Exhalations, Hurricanes, and Spouts; we may\r\nlearn that sulphureous Steams abound in the Bowels of the Earth and\r\nferment with Minerals, and sometimes take fire with a sudden Coruscation\r\nand Explosion; and if pent up in subterraneous Caverns, burst the\r\nCaverns with a great shaking of the Earth, as in springing of a Mine.\r\nAnd then the Vapour generated by the Explosion, expiring through the\r\nPores of the Earth, feels hot and suffocates, and makes Tempests and\r\nHurricanes, and sometimes causes the Land to slide, or the Sea to boil,\r\nand carries up the Water thereof in Drops, which by their weight fall\r\ndown again in Spouts. Also some sulphureous Steams, at all times when\r\nthe Earth is dry, ascending into the Air, ferment there with nitrous\r\nAcids, and sometimes taking fire cause Lightning and Thunder, and fiery\r\nMeteors. For the Air abounds with acid Vapours fit to promote\r\nFermentations, as appears by the rusting of Iron and Copper in it, the\r\nkindling of Fire by blowing, and the beating of the Heart by means of\r\nRespiration. Now the above-mention'd Motions are so great and violent as\r\nto shew that in Fermentations the Particles of Bodies which almost rest,\r\nare put into new Motions by a very potent Principle, which acts upon\r\nthem only when they approach one another, and causes them to meet and\r\nclash with great violence, and grow hot with the motion, and dash one\r\nanother into pieces, and vanish into Air, and Vapour, and Flame.\r\n\r\nWhen Salt of Tartar _per deliquium_, being poured into the Solution of\r\nany Metal, precipitates the Metal and makes it fall down to the bottom\r\nof the Liquor in the form of Mud: Does not this argue that the acid\r\nParticles are attracted more strongly by the Salt of Tartar than by the\r\nMetal, and by the stronger Attraction go from the Metal to the Salt of\r\nTartar? And so when a Solution of Iron in _Aqua fortis_ dissolves the\r\n_Lapis Calaminaris_, and lets go the Iron, or a Solution of Copper\r\ndissolves Iron immersed in it and lets go the Copper, or a Solution of\r\nSilver dissolves Copper and lets go the Silver, or a Solution of Mercury\r\nin _Aqua fortis_ being poured upon Iron, Copper, Tin, or Lead, dissolves\r\nthe Metal and lets go the Mercury; does not this argue that the acid\r\nParticles of the _Aqua fortis_ are attracted more strongly by the _Lapis\r\nCalaminaris_ than by Iron, and more strongly by Iron than by Copper, and\r\nmore strongly by Copper than by Silver, and more strongly by Iron,\r\nCopper, Tin, and Lead, than by Mercury? And is it not for the same\r\nreason that Iron requires more _Aqua fortis_ to dissolve it than Copper,\r\nand Copper more than the other Metals; and that of all Metals, Iron is\r\ndissolved most easily, and is most apt to rust; and next after Iron,\r\nCopper?\r\n\r\nWhen Oil of Vitriol is mix'd with a little Water, or is run _per\r\ndeliquium_, and in Distillation the Water ascends difficultly, and\r\nbrings over with it some part of the Oil of Vitriol in the form of\r\nSpirit of Vitriol, and this Spirit being poured upon Iron, Copper, or\r\nSalt of Tartar, unites with the Body and lets go the Water; doth not\r\nthis shew that the acid Spirit is attracted by the Water, and more\r\nattracted by the fix'd Body than by the Water, and therefore lets go the\r\nWater to close with the fix'd Body? And is it not for the same reason\r\nthat the Water and acid Spirits which are mix'd together in Vinegar,\r\n_Aqua fortis_, and Spirit of Salt, cohere and rise together in\r\nDistillation; but if the _Menstruum_ be poured on Salt of Tartar, or on\r\nLead, or Iron, or any fix'd Body which it can dissolve, the Acid by a\r\nstronger Attraction adheres to the Body, and lets go the Water? And is\r\nit not also from a mutual Attraction that the Spirits of Soot and\r\nSea-Salt unite and compose the Particles of Sal-armoniac, which are less\r\nvolatile than before, because grosser and freer from Water; and that the\r\nParticles of Sal-armoniac in Sublimation carry up the Particles of\r\nAntimony, which will not sublime alone; and that the Particles of\r\nMercury uniting with the acid Particles of Spirit of Salt compose\r\nMercury sublimate, and with the Particles of Sulphur, compose Cinnaber;\r\nand that the Particles of Spirit of Wine and Spirit of Urine well\r\nrectified unite, and letting go the Water which dissolved them, compose\r\na consistent Body; and that in subliming Cinnaber from Salt of Tartar,\r\nor from quick Lime, the Sulphur by a stronger Attraction of the Salt or\r\nLime lets go the Mercury, and stays with the fix'd Body; and that when\r\nMercury sublimate is sublimed from Antimony, or from Regulus of\r\nAntimony, the Spirit of Salt lets go the Mercury, and unites with the\r\nantimonial metal which attracts it more strongly, and stays with it till\r\nthe Heat be great enough to make them both ascend together, and then\r\ncarries up the Metal with it in the form of a very fusible Salt, called\r\nButter of Antimony, although the Spirit of Salt alone be almost as\r\nvolatile as Water, and the Antimony alone as fix'd as Lead?\r\n\r\nWhen _Aqua fortis_ dissolves Silver and not Gold, and _Aqua regia_\r\ndissolves Gold and not Silver, may it not be said that _Aqua fortis_ is\r\nsubtil enough to penetrate Gold as well as Silver, but wants the\r\nattractive Force to give it Entrance; and that _Aqua regia_ is subtil\r\nenough to penetrate Silver as well as Gold, but wants the attractive\r\nForce to give it Entrance? For _Aqua regia_ is nothing else than _Aqua\r\nfortis_ mix'd with some Spirit of Salt, or with Sal-armoniac; and even\r\ncommon Salt dissolved in _Aqua fortis_, enables the _Menstruum_ to\r\ndissolve Gold, though the Salt be a gross Body. When therefore Spirit of\r\nSalt precipitates Silver out of _Aqua fortis_, is it not done by\r\nattracting and mixing with the _Aqua fortis_, and not attracting, or\r\nperhaps repelling Silver? And when Water precipitates Antimony out of\r\nthe Sublimate of Antimony and Sal-armoniac, or out of Butter of\r\nAntimony, is it not done by its dissolving, mixing with, and weakening\r\nthe Sal-armoniac or Spirit of Salt, and its not attracting, or perhaps\r\nrepelling the Antimony? And is it not for want of an attractive virtue\r\nbetween the Parts of Water and Oil, of Quick-silver and Antimony, of\r\nLead and Iron, that these Substances do not mix; and by a weak\r\nAttraction, that Quick-silver and Copper mix difficultly; and from a\r\nstrong one, that Quick-silver and Tin, Antimony and Iron, Water and\r\nSalts, mix readily? And in general, is it not from the same Principle\r\nthat Heat congregates homogeneal Bodies, and separates heterogeneal\r\nones?\r\n\r\nWhen Arsenick with Soap gives a Regulus, and with Mercury sublimate a\r\nvolatile fusible Salt, like Butter of Antimony, doth not this shew that\r\nArsenick, which is a Substance totally volatile, is compounded of fix'd\r\nand volatile Parts, strongly cohering by a mutual Attraction, so that\r\nthe volatile will not ascend without carrying up the fixed? And so, when\r\nan equal weight of Spirit of Wine and Oil of Vitriol are digested\r\ntogether, and in Distillation yield two fragrant and volatile Spirits\r\nwhich will not mix with one another, and a fix'd black Earth remains\r\nbehind; doth not this shew that Oil of Vitriol is composed of volatile\r\nand fix'd Parts strongly united by Attraction, so as to ascend together\r\nin form of a volatile, acid, fluid Salt, until the Spirit of Wine\r\nattracts and separates the volatile Parts from the fixed? And therefore,\r\nsince Oil of Sulphur _per Campanam_ is of the same Nature with Oil of\r\nVitriol, may it not be inferred, that Sulphur is also a mixture of\r\nvolatile and fix'd Parts so strongly cohering by Attraction, as to\r\nascend together in Sublimation. By dissolving Flowers of Sulphur in Oil\r\nof Turpentine, and distilling the Solution, it is found that Sulphur is\r\ncomposed of an inflamable thick Oil or fat Bitumen, an acid Salt, a very\r\nfix'd Earth, and a little Metal. The three first were found not much\r\nunequal to one another, the fourth in so small a quantity as scarce to\r\nbe worth considering. The acid Salt dissolved in Water, is the same with\r\nOil of Sulphur _per Campanam_, and abounding much in the Bowels of the\r\nEarth, and particularly in Markasites, unites it self to the other\r\nIngredients of the Markasite, which are, Bitumen, Iron, Copper, and\r\nEarth, and with them compounds Allum, Vitriol, and Sulphur. With the\r\nEarth alone it compounds Allum; with the Metal alone, or Metal and\r\nEarth together, it compounds Vitriol; and with the Bitumen and Earth it\r\ncompounds Sulphur. Whence it comes to pass that Markasites abound with\r\nthose three Minerals. And is it not from the mutual Attraction of the\r\nIngredients that they stick together for compounding these Minerals, and\r\nthat the Bitumen carries up the other Ingredients of the Sulphur, which\r\nwithout it would not sublime? And the same Question may be put\r\nconcerning all, or almost all the gross Bodies in Nature. For all the\r\nParts of Animals and Vegetables are composed of Substances volatile and\r\nfix'd, fluid and solid, as appears by their Analysis; and so are Salts\r\nand Minerals, so far as Chymists have been hitherto able to examine\r\ntheir Composition.\r\n\r\nWhen Mercury sublimate is re-sublimed with fresh Mercury, and becomes\r\n_Mercurius Dulcis_, which is a white tasteless Earth scarce dissolvable\r\nin Water, and _Mercurius Dulcis_ re-sublimed with Spirit of Salt returns\r\ninto Mercury sublimate; and when Metals corroded with a little acid turn\r\ninto rust, which is an Earth tasteless and indissolvable in Water, and\r\nthis Earth imbibed with more acid becomes a metallick Salt; and when\r\nsome Stones, as Spar of Lead, dissolved in proper _Menstruums_ become\r\nSalts; do not these things shew that Salts are dry Earth and watry Acid\r\nunited by Attraction, and that the Earth will not become a Salt without\r\nso much acid as makes it dissolvable in Water? Do not the sharp and\r\npungent Tastes of Acids arise from the strong Attraction whereby the\r\nacid Particles rush upon and agitate the Particles of the Tongue? And\r\nwhen Metals are dissolved in acid _Menstruums_, and the Acids in\r\nconjunction with the Metal act after a different manner, so that the\r\nCompound has a different Taste much milder than before, and sometimes a\r\nsweet one; is it not because the Acids adhere to the metallick\r\nParticles, and thereby lose much of their Activity? And if the Acid be\r\nin too small a Proportion to make the Compound dissolvable in Water,\r\nwill it not by adhering strongly to the Metal become unactive and lose\r\nits Taste, and the Compound be a tasteless Earth? For such things as are\r\nnot dissolvable by the Moisture of the Tongue, act not upon the Taste.\r\n\r\nAs Gravity makes the Sea flow round the denser and weightier Parts of\r\nthe Globe of the Earth, so the Attraction may make the watry Acid flow\r\nround the denser and compacter Particles of Earth for composing the\r\nParticles of Salt. For otherwise the Acid would not do the Office of a\r\nMedium between the Earth and common Water, for making Salts dissolvable\r\nin the Water; nor would Salt of Tartar readily draw off the Acid from\r\ndissolved Metals, nor Metals the Acid from Mercury. Now, as in the great\r\nGlobe of the Earth and Sea, the densest Bodies by their Gravity sink\r\ndown in Water, and always endeavour to go towards the Center of the\r\nGlobe; so in Particles of Salt, the densest Matter may always endeavour\r\nto approach the Center of the Particle: So that a Particle of Salt may\r\nbe compared to a Chaos; being dense, hard, dry, and earthy in the\r\nCenter; and rare, soft, moist, and watry in the Circumference. And\r\nhence it seems to be that Salts are of a lasting Nature, being scarce\r\ndestroy'd, unless by drawing away their watry Parts by violence, or by\r\nletting them soak into the Pores of the central Earth by a gentle Heat\r\nin Putrefaction, until the Earth be dissolved by the Water, and\r\nseparated into smaller Particles, which by reason of their Smallness\r\nmake the rotten Compound appear of a black Colour. Hence also it may be,\r\nthat the Parts of Animals and Vegetables preserve their several Forms,\r\nand assimilate their Nourishment; the soft and moist Nourishment easily\r\nchanging its Texture by a gentle Heat and Motion, till it becomes like\r\nthe dense, hard, dry, and durable Earth in the Center of each Particle.\r\nBut when the Nourishment grows unfit to be assimilated, or the central\r\nEarth grows too feeble to assimilate it, the Motion ends in Confusion,\r\nPutrefaction, and Death.\r\n\r\nIf a very small quantity of any Salt or Vitriol be dissolved in a great\r\nquantity of Water, the Particles of the Salt or Vitriol will not sink to\r\nthe bottom, though they be heavier in Specie than the Water, but will\r\nevenly diffuse themselves into all the Water, so as to make it as saline\r\nat the top as at the bottom. And does not this imply that the Parts of\r\nthe Salt or Vitriol recede from one another, and endeavour to expand\r\nthemselves, and get as far asunder as the quantity of Water in which\r\nthey float, will allow? And does not this Endeavour imply that they have\r\na repulsive Force by which they fly from one another, or at least, that\r\nthey attract the Water more strongly than they do one another? For as\r\nall things ascend in Water which are less attracted than Water, by the\r\ngravitating Power of the Earth; so all the Particles of Salt which float\r\nin Water, and are less attracted than Water by any one Particle of Salt,\r\nmust recede from that Particle, and give way to the more attracted\r\nWater.\r\n\r\nWhen any saline Liquor is evaporated to a Cuticle and let cool, the Salt\r\nconcretes in regular Figures; which argues, that the Particles of the\r\nSalt before they concreted, floated in the Liquor at equal distances in\r\nrank and file, and by consequence that they acted upon one another by\r\nsome Power which at equal distances is equal, at unequal distances\r\nunequal. For by such a Power they will range themselves uniformly, and\r\nwithout it they will float irregularly, and come together as\r\nirregularly. And since the Particles of Island-Crystal act all the same\r\nway upon the Rays of Light for causing the unusual Refraction, may it\r\nnot be supposed that in the Formation of this Crystal, the Particles not\r\nonly ranged themselves in rank and file for concreting in regular\r\nFigures, but also by some kind of polar Virtue turned their homogeneal\r\nSides the same way.\r\n\r\nThe Parts of all homogeneal hard Bodies which fully touch one another,\r\nstick together very strongly. And for explaining how this may be, some\r\nhave invented hooked Atoms, which is begging the Question; and others\r\ntell us that Bodies are glued together by rest, that is, by an occult\r\nQuality, or rather by nothing; and others, that they stick together by\r\nconspiring Motions, that is, by relative rest amongst themselves. I had\r\nrather infer from their Cohesion, that their Particles attract one\r\nanother by some Force, which in immediate Contact is exceeding strong,\r\nat small distances performs the chymical Operations above-mention'd, and\r\nreaches not far from the Particles with any sensible Effect.\r\n\r\nAll Bodies seem to be composed of hard Particles: For otherwise Fluids\r\nwould not congeal; as Water, Oils, Vinegar, and Spirit or Oil of Vitriol\r\ndo by freezing; Mercury by Fumes of Lead; Spirit of Nitre and Mercury,\r\nby dissolving the Mercury and evaporating the Flegm; Spirit of Wine and\r\nSpirit of Urine, by deflegming and mixing them; and Spirit of Urine and\r\nSpirit of Salt, by subliming them together to make Sal-armoniac. Even\r\nthe Rays of Light seem to be hard Bodies; for otherwise they would not\r\nretain different Properties in their different Sides. And therefore\r\nHardness may be reckon'd the Property of all uncompounded Matter. At\r\nleast, this seems to be as evident as the universal Impenetrability of\r\nMatter. For all Bodies, so far as Experience reaches, are either hard,\r\nor may be harden'd; and we have no other Evidence of universal\r\nImpenetrability, besides a large Experience without an experimental\r\nException. Now if compound Bodies are so very hard as we find some of\r\nthem to be, and yet are very porous, and consist of Parts which are only\r\nlaid together; the simple Particles which are void of Pores, and were\r\nnever yet divided, must be much harder. For such hard Particles being\r\nheaped up together, can scarce touch one another in more than a few\r\nPoints, and therefore must be separable by much less Force than is\r\nrequisite to break a solid Particle, whose Parts touch in all the Space\r\nbetween them, without any Pores or Interstices to weaken their Cohesion.\r\nAnd how such very hard Particles which are only laid together and touch\r\nonly in a few Points, can stick together, and that so firmly as they do,\r\nwithout the assistance of something which causes them to be attracted or\r\npress'd towards one another, is very difficult to conceive.\r\n\r\nThe same thing I infer also from the cohering of two polish'd Marbles\r\n_in vacuo_, and from the standing of Quick-silver in the Barometer at\r\nthe height of 50, 60 or 70 Inches, or above, when ever it is well-purged\r\nof Air and carefully poured in, so that its Parts be every where\r\ncontiguous both to one another and to the Glass. The Atmosphere by its\r\nweight presses the Quick-silver into the Glass, to the height of 29 or\r\n30 Inches. And some other Agent raises it higher, not by pressing it\r\ninto the Glass, but by making its Parts stick to the Glass, and to one\r\nanother. For upon any discontinuation of Parts, made either by Bubbles\r\nor by shaking the Glass, the whole Mercury falls down to the height of\r\n29 or 30 Inches.\r\n\r\nAnd of the same kind with these Experiments are those that follow. If\r\ntwo plane polish'd Plates of Glass (suppose two pieces of a polish'd\r\nLooking-glass) be laid together, so that their sides be parallel and at\r\na very small distance from one another, and then their lower edges be\r\ndipped into Water, the Water will rise up between them. And the less\r\nthe distance of the Glasses is, the greater will be the height to which\r\nthe Water will rise. If the distance be about the hundredth part of an\r\nInch, the Water will rise to the height of about an Inch; and if the\r\ndistance be greater or less in any Proportion, the height will be\r\nreciprocally proportional to the distance very nearly. For the\r\nattractive Force of the Glasses is the same, whether the distance\r\nbetween them be greater or less; and the weight of the Water drawn up is\r\nthe same, if the height of it be reciprocally proportional to the\r\ndistance of the Glasses. And in like manner, Water ascends between two\r\nMarbles polish'd plane, when their polish'd sides are parallel, and at a\r\nvery little distance from one another, And if slender Pipes of Glass be\r\ndipped at one end into stagnating Water, the Water will rise up within\r\nthe Pipe, and the height to which it rises will be reciprocally\r\nproportional to the Diameter of the Cavity of the Pipe, and will equal\r\nthe height to which it rises between two Planes of Glass, if the\r\nSemi-diameter of the Cavity of the Pipe be equal to the distance between\r\nthe Planes, or thereabouts. And these Experiments succeed after the same\r\nmanner _in vacuo_ as in the open Air, (as hath been tried before the\r\nRoyal Society,) and therefore are not influenced by the Weight or\r\nPressure of the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnd if a large Pipe of Glass be filled with sifted Ashes well pressed\r\ntogether in the Glass, and one end of the Pipe be dipped into stagnating\r\nWater, the Water will rise up slowly in the Ashes, so as in the space\r\nof a Week or Fortnight to reach up within the Glass, to the height of 30\r\nor 40 Inches above the stagnating Water. And the Water rises up to this\r\nheight by the Action only of those Particles of the Ashes which are upon\r\nthe Surface of the elevated Water; the Particles which are within the\r\nWater, attracting or repelling it as much downwards as upwards. And\r\ntherefore the Action of the Particles is very strong. But the Particles\r\nof the Ashes being not so dense and close together as those of Glass,\r\ntheir Action is not so strong as that of Glass, which keeps Quick-silver\r\nsuspended to the height of 60 or 70 Inches, and therefore acts with a\r\nForce which would keep Water suspended to the height of above 60 Feet.\r\n\r\nBy the same Principle, a Sponge sucks in Water, and the Glands in the\r\nBodies of Animals, according to their several Natures and Dispositions,\r\nsuck in various Juices from the Blood.\r\n\r\nIf two plane polish'd Plates of Glass three or four Inches broad, and\r\ntwenty or twenty five long, be laid one of them parallel to the Horizon,\r\nthe other upon the first, so as at one of their ends to touch one\r\nanother, and contain an Angle of about 10 or 15 Minutes, and the same be\r\nfirst moisten'd on their inward sides with a clean Cloth dipp'd into Oil\r\nof Oranges or Spirit of Turpentine, and a Drop or two of the Oil or\r\nSpirit be let fall upon the lower Glass at the other; so soon as the\r\nupper Glass is laid down upon the lower, so as to touch it at one end as\r\nabove, and to touch the Drop at the other end, making with the lower\r\nGlass an Angle of about 10 or 15 Minutes; the Drop will begin to move\r\ntowards the Concourse of the Glasses, and will continue to move with an\r\naccelerated Motion, till it arrives at that Concourse of the Glasses.\r\nFor the two Glasses attract the Drop, and make it run that way towards\r\nwhich the Attractions incline. And if when the Drop is in motion you\r\nlift up that end of the Glasses where they meet, and towards which the\r\nDrop moves, the Drop will ascend between the Glasses, and therefore is\r\nattracted. And as you lift up the Glasses more and more, the Drop will\r\nascend slower and slower, and at length rest, being then carried\r\ndownward by its Weight, as much as upwards by the Attraction. And by\r\nthis means you may know the Force by which the Drop is attracted at all\r\ndistances from the Concourse of the Glasses.\r\n\r\nNow by some Experiments of this kind, (made by Mr. _Hauksbee_) it has\r\nbeen found that the Attraction is almost reciprocally in a duplicate\r\nProportion of the distance of the middle of the Drop from the Concourse\r\nof the Glasses, _viz._ reciprocally in a simple Proportion, by reason of\r\nthe spreading of the Drop, and its touching each Glass in a larger\r\nSurface; and again reciprocally in a simple Proportion, by reason of the\r\nAttractions growing stronger within the same quantity of attracting\r\nSurface. The Attraction therefore within the same quantity of attracting\r\nSurface, is reciprocally as the distance between the Glasses. And\r\ntherefore where the distance is exceeding small, the Attraction must be\r\nexceeding great. By the Table in the second Part of the second Book,\r\nwherein the thicknesses of colour'd Plates of Water between two Glasses\r\nare set down, the thickness of the Plate where it appears very black, is\r\nthree eighths of the ten hundred thousandth part of an Inch. And where\r\nthe Oil of Oranges between the Glasses is of this thickness, the\r\nAttraction collected by the foregoing Rule, seems to be so strong, as\r\nwithin a Circle of an Inch in diameter, to suffice to hold up a Weight\r\nequal to that of a Cylinder of Water of an Inch in diameter, and two or\r\nthree Furlongs in length. And where it is of a less thickness the\r\nAttraction may be proportionally greater, and continue to increase,\r\nuntil the thickness do not exceed that of a single Particle of the Oil.\r\nThere are therefore Agents in Nature able to make the Particles of\r\nBodies stick together by very strong Attractions. And it is the Business\r\nof experimental Philosophy to find them out.\r\n\r\nNow the smallest Particles of Matter may cohere by the strongest\r\nAttractions, and compose bigger Particles of weaker Virtue; and many of\r\nthese may cohere and compose bigger Particles whose Virtue is still\r\nweaker, and so on for divers Successions, until the Progression end in\r\nthe biggest Particles on which the Operations in Chymistry, and the\r\nColours of natural Bodies depend, and which by cohering compose Bodies\r\nof a sensible Magnitude. If the Body is compact, and bends or yields\r\ninward to Pression without any sliding of its Parts, it is hard and\r\nelastick, returning to its Figure with a Force rising from the mutual\r\nAttraction of its Parts. If the Parts slide upon one another, the Body\r\nis malleable or soft. If they slip easily, and are of a fit Size to be\r\nagitated by Heat, and the Heat is big enough to keep them in Agitation,\r\nthe Body is fluid; and if it be apt to stick to things, it is humid; and\r\nthe Drops of every fluid affect a round Figure by the mutual Attraction\r\nof their Parts, as the Globe of the Earth and Sea affects a round Figure\r\nby the mutual Attraction of its Parts by Gravity.\r\n\r\nSince Metals dissolved in Acids attract but a small quantity of the\r\nAcid, their attractive Force can reach but to a small distance from\r\nthem. And as in Algebra, where affirmative Quantities vanish and cease,\r\nthere negative ones begin; so in Mechanicks, where Attraction ceases,\r\nthere a repulsive Virtue ought to succeed. And that there is such a\r\nVirtue, seems to follow from the Reflexions and Inflexions of the Rays\r\nof Light. For the Rays are repelled by Bodies in both these Cases,\r\nwithout the immediate Contact of the reflecting or inflecting Body. It\r\nseems also to follow from the Emission of Light; the Ray so soon as it\r\nis shaken off from a shining Body by the vibrating Motion of the Parts\r\nof the Body, and gets beyond the reach of Attraction, being driven away\r\nwith exceeding great Velocity. For that Force which is sufficient to\r\nturn it back in Reflexion, may be sufficient to emit it. It seems also\r\nto follow from the Production of Air and Vapour. The Particles when they\r\nare shaken off from Bodies by Heat or Fermentation, so soon as they are\r\nbeyond the reach of the Attraction of the Body, receding from it, and\r\nalso from one another with great Strength, and keeping at a distance,\r\nso as sometimes to take up above a Million of Times more space than they\r\ndid before in the form of a dense Body. Which vast Contraction and\r\nExpansion seems unintelligible, by feigning the Particles of Air to be\r\nspringy and ramous, or rolled up like Hoops, or by any other means than\r\na repulsive Power. The Particles of Fluids which do not cohere too\r\nstrongly, and are of such a Smallness as renders them most susceptible\r\nof those Agitations which keep Liquors in a Fluor, are most easily\r\nseparated and rarified into Vapour, and in the Language of the Chymists,\r\nthey are volatile, rarifying with an easy Heat, and condensing with\r\nCold. But those which are grosser, and so less susceptible of Agitation,\r\nor cohere by a stronger Attraction, are not separated without a stronger\r\nHeat, or perhaps not without Fermentation. And these last are the Bodies\r\nwhich Chymists call fix'd, and being rarified by Fermentation, become\r\ntrue permanent Air; those Particles receding from one another with the\r\ngreatest Force, and being most difficultly brought together, which upon\r\nContact cohere most strongly. And because the Particles of permanent Air\r\nare grosser, and arise from denser Substances than those of Vapours,\r\nthence it is that true Air is more ponderous than Vapour, and that a\r\nmoist Atmosphere is lighter than a dry one, quantity for quantity. From\r\nthe same repelling Power it seems to be that Flies walk upon the Water\r\nwithout wetting their Feet; and that the Object-glasses of long\r\nTelescopes lie upon one another without touching; and that dry Powders\r\nare difficultly made to touch one another so as to stick together,\r\nunless by melting them, or wetting them with Water, which by exhaling\r\nmay bring them together; and that two polish'd Marbles, which by\r\nimmediate Contact stick together, are difficultly brought so close\r\ntogether as to stick.\r\n\r\nAnd thus Nature will be very conformable to her self and very simple,\r\nperforming all the great Motions of the heavenly Bodies by the\r\nAttraction of Gravity which intercedes those Bodies, and almost all the\r\nsmall ones of their Particles by some other attractive and repelling\r\nPowers which intercede the Particles. The _Vis inertiae_ is a passive\r\nPrinciple by which Bodies persist in their Motion or Rest, receive\r\nMotion in proportion to the Force impressing it, and resist as much as\r\nthey are resisted. By this Principle alone there never could have been\r\nany Motion in the World. Some other Principle was necessary for putting\r\nBodies into Motion; and now they are in Motion, some other Principle is\r\nnecessary for conserving the Motion. For from the various Composition of\r\ntwo Motions, 'tis very certain that there is not always the same\r\nquantity of Motion in the World. For if two Globes joined by a slender\r\nRod, revolve about their common Center of Gravity with an uniform\r\nMotion, while that Center moves on uniformly in a right Line drawn in\r\nthe Plane of their circular Motion; the Sum of the Motions of the two\r\nGlobes, as often as the Globes are in the right Line described by their\r\ncommon Center of Gravity, will be bigger than the Sum of their Motions,\r\nwhen they are in a Line perpendicular to that right Line. By this\r\nInstance it appears that Motion may be got or lost. But by reason of the\r\nTenacity of Fluids, and Attrition of their Parts, and the Weakness of\r\nElasticity in Solids, Motion is much more apt to be lost than got, and\r\nis always upon the Decay. For Bodies which are either absolutely hard,\r\nor so soft as to be void of Elasticity, will not rebound from one\r\nanother. Impenetrability makes them only stop. If two equal Bodies meet\r\ndirectly _in vacuo_, they will by the Laws of Motion stop where they\r\nmeet, and lose all their Motion, and remain in rest, unless they be\r\nelastick, and receive new Motion from their Spring. If they have so much\r\nElasticity as suffices to make them re-bound with a quarter, or half, or\r\nthree quarters of the Force with which they come together, they will\r\nlose three quarters, or half, or a quarter of their Motion. And this may\r\nbe try'd, by letting two equal Pendulums fall against one another from\r\nequal heights. If the Pendulums be of Lead or soft Clay, they will lose\r\nall or almost all their Motions: If of elastick Bodies they will lose\r\nall but what they recover from their Elasticity. If it be said, that\r\nthey can lose no Motion but what they communicate to other Bodies, the\r\nconsequence is, that _in vacuo_ they can lose no Motion, but when they\r\nmeet they must go on and penetrate one another's Dimensions. If three\r\nequal round Vessels be filled, the one with Water, the other with Oil,\r\nthe third with molten Pitch, and the Liquors be stirred about alike to\r\ngive them a vortical Motion; the Pitch by its Tenacity will lose its\r\nMotion quickly, the Oil being less tenacious will keep it longer, and\r\nthe Water being less tenacious will keep it longest, but yet will lose\r\nit in a short time. Whence it is easy to understand, that if many\r\ncontiguous Vortices of molten Pitch were each of them as large as those\r\nwhich some suppose to revolve about the Sun and fix'd Stars, yet these\r\nand all their Parts would, by their Tenacity and Stiffness, communicate\r\ntheir Motion to one another till they all rested among themselves.\r\nVortices of Oil or Water, or some fluider Matter, might continue longer\r\nin Motion; but unless the Matter were void of all Tenacity and Attrition\r\nof Parts, and Communication of Motion, (which is not to be supposed,)\r\nthe Motion would constantly decay. Seeing therefore the variety of\r\nMotion which we find in the World is always decreasing, there is a\r\nnecessity of conserving and recruiting it by active Principles, such as\r\nare the cause of Gravity, by which Planets and Comets keep their Motions\r\nin their Orbs, and Bodies acquire great Motion in falling; and the cause\r\nof Fermentation, by which the Heart and Blood of Animals are kept in\r\nperpetual Motion and Heat; the inward Parts of the Earth are constantly\r\nwarm'd, and in some places grow very hot; Bodies burn and shine,\r\nMountains take fire, the Caverns of the Earth are blown up, and the Sun\r\ncontinues violently hot and lucid, and warms all things by his Light.\r\nFor we meet with very little Motion in the World, besides what is owing\r\nto these active Principles. And if it were not for these Principles, the\r\nBodies of the Earth, Planets, Comets, Sun, and all things in them,\r\nwould grow cold and freeze, and become inactive Masses; and all\r\nPutrefaction, Generation, Vegetation and Life would cease, and the\r\nPlanets and Comets would not remain in their Orbs.\r\n\r\nAll these things being consider'd, it seems probable to me, that God in\r\nthe Beginning form'd Matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable,\r\nmoveable Particles, of such Sizes and Figures, and with such other\r\nProperties, and in such Proportion to Space, as most conduced to the End\r\nfor which he form'd them; and that these primitive Particles being\r\nSolids, are incomparably harder than any porous Bodies compounded of\r\nthem; even so very hard, as never to wear or break in pieces; no\r\nordinary Power being able to divide what God himself made one in the\r\nfirst Creation. While the Particles continue entire, they may compose\r\nBodies of one and the same Nature and Texture in all Ages: But should\r\nthey wear away, or break in pieces, the Nature of Things depending on\r\nthem, would be changed. Water and Earth, composed of old worn Particles\r\nand Fragments of Particles, would not be of the same Nature and Texture\r\nnow, with Water and Earth composed of entire Particles in the Beginning.\r\nAnd therefore, that Nature may be lasting, the Changes of corporeal\r\nThings are to be placed only in the various Separations and new\r\nAssociations and Motions of these permanent Particles; compound Bodies\r\nbeing apt to break, not in the midst of solid Particles, but where those\r\nParticles are laid together, and only touch in a few Points.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me farther, that these Particles have not only a _Vis\r\ninertiae_, accompanied with such passive Laws of Motion as naturally\r\nresult from that Force, but also that they are moved by certain active\r\nPrinciples, such as is that of Gravity, and that which causes\r\nFermentation, and the Cohesion of Bodies. These Principles I consider,\r\nnot as occult Qualities, supposed to result from the specifick Forms of\r\nThings, but as general Laws of Nature, by which the Things themselves\r\nare form'd; their Truth appearing to us by Phaenomena, though their\r\nCauses be not yet discover'd. For these are manifest Qualities, and\r\ntheir Causes only are occult. And the _Aristotelians_ gave the Name of\r\noccult Qualities, not to manifest Qualities, but to such Qualities only\r\nas they supposed to lie hid in Bodies, and to be the unknown Causes of\r\nmanifest Effects: Such as would be the Causes of Gravity, and of\r\nmagnetick and electrick Attractions, and of Fermentations, if we should\r\nsuppose that these Forces or Actions arose from Qualities unknown to us,\r\nand uncapable of being discovered and made manifest. Such occult\r\nQualities put a stop to the Improvement of natural Philosophy, and\r\ntherefore of late Years have been rejected. To tell us that every\r\nSpecies of Things is endow'd with an occult specifick Quality by which\r\nit acts and produces manifest Effects, is to tell us nothing: But to\r\nderive two or three general Principles of Motion from Phaenomena, and\r\nafterwards to tell us how the Properties and Actions of all corporeal\r\nThings follow from those manifest Principles, would be a very great step\r\nin Philosophy, though the Causes of those Principles were not yet\r\ndiscover'd: And therefore I scruple not to propose the Principles of\r\nMotion above-mention'd, they being of very general Extent, and leave\r\ntheir Causes to be found out.\r\n\r\nNow by the help of these Principles, all material Things seem to have\r\nbeen composed of the hard and solid Particles above-mention'd, variously\r\nassociated in the first Creation by the Counsel of an intelligent Agent.\r\nFor it became him who created them to set them in order. And if he did\r\nso, it's unphilosophical to seek for any other Origin of the World, or\r\nto pretend that it might arise out of a Chaos by the mere Laws of\r\nNature; though being once form'd, it may continue by those Laws for many\r\nAges. For while Comets move in very excentrick Orbs in all manner of\r\nPositions, blind Fate could never make all the Planets move one and the\r\nsame way in Orbs concentrick, some inconsiderable Irregularities\r\nexcepted, which may have risen from the mutual Actions of Comets and\r\nPlanets upon one another, and which will be apt to increase, till this\r\nSystem wants a Reformation. Such a wonderful Uniformity in the Planetary\r\nSystem must be allowed the Effect of Choice. And so must the Uniformity\r\nin the Bodies of Animals, they having generally a right and a left side\r\nshaped alike, and on either side of their Bodies two Legs behind, and\r\neither two Arms, or two Legs, or two Wings before upon their Shoulders,\r\nand between their Shoulders a Neck running down into a Back-bone, and a\r\nHead upon it; and in the Head two Ears, two Eyes, a Nose, a Mouth, and\r\na Tongue, alike situated. Also the first Contrivance of those very\r\nartificial Parts of Animals, the Eyes, Ears, Brain, Muscles, Heart,\r\nLungs, Midriff, Glands, Larynx, Hands, Wings, swimming Bladders, natural\r\nSpectacles, and other Organs of Sense and Motion; and the Instinct of\r\nBrutes and Insects, can be the effect of nothing else than the Wisdom\r\nand Skill of a powerful ever-living Agent, who being in all Places, is\r\nmore able by his Will to move the Bodies within his boundless uniform\r\nSensorium, and thereby to form and reform the Parts of the Universe,\r\nthan we are by our Will to move the Parts of our own Bodies. And yet we\r\nare not to consider the World as the Body of God, or the several Parts\r\nthereof, as the Parts of God. He is an uniform Being, void of Organs,\r\nMembers or Parts, and they are his Creatures subordinate to him, and\r\nsubservient to his Will; and he is no more the Soul of them, than the\r\nSoul of Man is the Soul of the Species of Things carried through the\r\nOrgans of Sense into the place of its Sensation, where it perceives them\r\nby means of its immediate Presence, without the Intervention of any\r\nthird thing. The Organs of Sense are not for enabling the Soul to\r\nperceive the Species of Things in its Sensorium, but only for conveying\r\nthem thither; and God has no need of such Organs, he being every where\r\npresent to the Things themselves. And since Space is divisible _in\r\ninfinitum_, and Matter is not necessarily in all places, it may be also\r\nallow'd that God is able to create Particles of Matter of several Sizes\r\nand Figures, and in several Proportions to Space, and perhaps of\r\ndifferent Densities and Forces, and thereby to vary the Laws of Nature,\r\nand make Worlds of several sorts in several Parts of the Universe. At\r\nleast, I see nothing of Contradiction in all this.\r\n\r\nAs in Mathematicks, so in Natural Philosophy, the Investigation of\r\ndifficult Things by the Method of Analysis, ought ever to precede the\r\nMethod of Composition. This Analysis consists in making Experiments and\r\nObservations, and in drawing general Conclusions from them by Induction,\r\nand admitting of no Objections against the Conclusions, but such as are\r\ntaken from Experiments, or other certain Truths. For Hypotheses are not\r\nto be regarded in experimental Philosophy. And although the arguing from\r\nExperiments and Observations by Induction be no Demonstration of general\r\nConclusions; yet it is the best way of arguing which the Nature of\r\nThings admits of, and may be looked upon as so much the stronger, by how\r\nmuch the Induction is more general. And if no Exception occur from\r\nPhaenomena, the Conclusion may be pronounced generally. But if at any\r\ntime afterwards any Exception shall occur from Experiments, it may then\r\nbegin to be pronounced with such Exceptions as occur. By this way of\r\nAnalysis we may proceed from Compounds to Ingredients, and from Motions\r\nto the Forces producing them; and in general, from Effects to their\r\nCauses, and from particular Causes to more general ones, till the\r\nArgument end in the most general. This is the Method of Analysis: And\r\nthe Synthesis consists in assuming the Causes discover'd, and\r\nestablish'd as Principles, and by them explaining the Phaenomena\r\nproceeding from them, and proving the Explanations.\r\n\r\nIn the two first Books of these Opticks, I proceeded by this Analysis to\r\ndiscover and prove the original Differences of the Rays of Light in\r\nrespect of Refrangibility, Reflexibility, and Colour, and their\r\nalternate Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission, and the\r\nProperties of Bodies, both opake and pellucid, on which their Reflexions\r\nand Colours depend. And these Discoveries being proved, may be assumed\r\nin the Method of Composition for explaining the Phaenomena arising from\r\nthem: An Instance of which Method I gave in the End of the first Book.\r\nIn this third Book I have only begun the Analysis of what remains to be\r\ndiscover'd about Light and its Effects upon the Frame of Nature, hinting\r\nseveral things about it, and leaving the Hints to be examin'd and\r\nimprov'd by the farther Experiments and Observations of such as are\r\ninquisitive. And if natural Philosophy in all its Parts, by pursuing\r\nthis Method, shall at length be perfected, the Bounds of Moral\r\nPhilosophy will be also enlarged. For so far as we can know by natural\r\nPhilosophy what is the first Cause, what Power he has over us, and what\r\nBenefits we receive from him, so far our Duty towards him, as well as\r\nthat towards one another, will appear to us by the Light of Nature. And\r\nno doubt, if the Worship of false Gods had not blinded the Heathen,\r\ntheir moral Philosophy would have gone farther than to the four\r\nCardinal Virtues; and instead of teaching the Transmigration of Souls,\r\nand to worship the Sun and Moon, and dead Heroes, they would have taught\r\nus to worship our true Author and Benefactor, as their Ancestors did\r\nunder the Government of _Noah_ and his Sons before they corrupted\r\nthemselves.",
