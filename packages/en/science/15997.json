The family has given me unstinted\r\nconfidence in using or rejecting letters and reminiscences, and although\r\nI have consulted scientific and literary friends, I alone must be blamed\r\nfor sins of omission or commission. Nothing has been suppressed in the\r\nunpublished letters, or in any of the letters which appear in these\r\nvolumes, because there was anything to hide. Everything Wallace wrote,\r\nall his private letters, could be published to the world. His life was\r\nan open book--\"no weakness, no contempt, dispraise, or blame, nothing\r\nbut well and fair.\"\r\n\r\nThe profoundly interesting and now historic correspondence between\r\nDarwin and Wallace, part of which has already appeared in the \"Life and\r\nLetters of Charles Darwin\" and \"More Letters,\" and part in Wallace's\r\nautobiography, entitled \"My Life,\" is here published, with new\r\nadditions, for the first time as a whole, so that the reader now has\r\nbefore him the necessary material to form a true estimate of the origin\r\nand growth of the theory of Natural Selection, and of the personal\r\nrelationships of its noble co-discoverers.\r\n\r\nMy warmest thanks are offered to Sir Francis Darwin for permission to\r\nuse his father's letters, for his annotations, and for rendering help in\r\nchecking the typescript of the Darwin letters; to Mr. John Murray,\r\nC.V.O., for permission to use letters and notes from the \"Life and\r\nLetters of Charles Darwin\" and from \"More Letters\"; to Messrs. Chapman\r\nand Hall for their great generosity in allowing the free use of letters\r\nand material in Wallace's \"My Life\"; to Prof. E.B. Poulton, Prof. Sir\r\nW.F. Barrett, Sir Wm. Thiselton-Dyer, Dr. Henry Forbes, and others for\r\nletters and reminiscences; and to Prof. Poulton for reading the proofs\r\nand for valuable suggestions. An intimate chapter on Wallace's Home Life\r\nhas been contributed by his son and daughter, Mr. W.G.

Now\r\nthat the plan is completed, Darwin and Wallace are together in this\r\nwonderful galaxy of the great men of science of the nineteenth century.\r\nSeveral illustrious names are missing from this eminent company;\r\nforemost amongst them being that of Herbert Spencer, the lofty master of\r\nthat synthetic philosophy which seemed to his disciples to have the\r\nproportions and qualities of an enduring monument, and whose\r\nincomparable fertility of creative thought entitled him to share the\r\nthrone with Darwin. It was Spencer, Darwin, Wallace, Hooker, Lyell and\r\nHuxley who led that historic movement which garnered the work of Lamarck\r\nand Buffon, and gave new direction to the ceaseless interrogation of\r\nnature to discover the \"how\" and the \"why\" of the august progression of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLooking over the long list of the departed whose names are enshrined in\r\nour Minster, one has sorrowfully to observe that contemporary opinion of\r\ntheir place in history and abiding worth was not infrequently astray;\r\nthat memory has, indeed, forgotten their works; and their memorials\r\nmight be removed to some cloister without loss of respect for the dead,\r\nperhaps even with the silent approval of their own day and generation\r\ncould it awake from its endless sleep and review the strange and\r\neventful course of human life since they left \"this bank and shoal of\r\ntime.\" But may it not be safely prophesied that of all the names on the\r\nstarry scroll of national fame that of Charles Darwin will, surely,\r\nremain unquestioned? And entwined with his enduring memory, by right of\r\nworth and work, and we know with Darwin's fullest approval, our\r\nsuccessors will discover the name of Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin and\r\nWallace were pre-eminent sons of light.\r\n\r\nAmong the great men of the Victorian age Wallace occupied a unique\r\nposition. He was the co-discoverer of the illuminating theory of Natural\r\nSelection; he watched its struggle for recognition against prejudice,\r\nignorance, ridicule and misrepresentation; its gradual adoption by its\r\ntraditional enemies; and its final supremacy. And he lived beyond the\r\nhour of its signal triumph and witnessed the further advance into the\r\nsame field of research of other patient investigators who are disclosing\r\nfresh phases of the same fundamental laws of development, and are\r\naccumulating a vast array of new facts which tell of still richer light\r\nto come to enlighten every man born into the world. To have lived\r\nthrough that brilliant period and into the second decade of the\r\ntwentieth century; to have outlived all contemporaries, having been the\r\nco-revealer of the greatest and most far-reaching generalisation in an\r\nera which abounded in fruitful discoveries and in revolutionary\r\nadvances in the application of science to life, is verily to have been\r\nthe chosen of the gods.\r\n\r\nWho and what manner of man was Alfred Russel Wallace? Who were his\r\nforbears? How did he obtain his insight into the closest secrets of\r\nnature? What was the extent of his contributions to our stock of human\r\nknowledge? In which directions did he most influence his age? What is\r\nknown of his inner life? These are some of the questions which most\r\npresent-day readers and all future readers into whose hands this book\r\nmay come will ask.\r\n\r\nAs to his descent, his upbringing, his education and his estimate of his\r\nown character and work, we can, with rare good fortune, refer them to\r\nhis autobiography, in which he tells his own story and relates the\r\ncircumstances which, combined with his natural disposition, led him to\r\nbe a great naturalist and a courageous social reformer; nay more, his\r\nautobiography is also in part a peculiar revelation of the inner man\r\nsuch as no biography could approach. We are also able to send inquirers\r\nto the biographies and works of his contemporaries--Darwin, Hooker,\r\nLyell, Huxley and many others. All this material is already available to\r\nthe diligent reader. But there are other sources of information which\r\nthe present book discloses--Wallace's home life, the large collection of\r\nhis own letters, the reminiscences of friends, communications which he\r\nreceived from many co-workers and correspondents which, besides being of\r\ninterest in themselves, often cast a sidelight upon his own mind and\r\nwork. All these are of peculiar and intimate value to those who desire\r\nto form a complete estimate of Wallace. And it is to help the reader to\r\nachieve this desirable result that the present work is published.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated here that Wallace had suggested to the present writer\r\nthat he should undertake a new work, to be called \"Darwin and Wallace,\"\r\nwhich was to have been a comparative study of their literary and\r\nscientific writings, with an estimate of the present position of the\r\ntheory of Natural Selection as an adequate explanation of the process of\r\norganic evolution. Wallace had promised to give as much assistance as\r\npossible in selecting the material without which the task on such a\r\nscale would obviously have been impossible. Alas! soon after the\r\nagreement with the publishers was signed and in the very month that the\r\nplan of the work was to have been shown to Wallace, his hand was\r\nunexpectedly stilled in death; and the book remains unwritten. But as\r\nthe names of Darwin and Wallace are inseparable even by the scythe of\r\ntime, a slight attempt is here made, in the first sections of Part I.\r\nand Part II., to take note of their ancestry and the diversities and\r\nsimilarities in their respective characters and environments--social and\r\neducational; to mark the chief characteristics of their literary works\r\nand the more salient conditions and events which led them,\r\nindependently, to the idea of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nFinally, it may be remarked that up to the present time the unique work\r\nand position of Wallace have not been fully disclosed owing to his great\r\nmodesty and to the fact that he outlived all his contemporaries. \"I am\r\nafraid,\" wrote Sir W.T. Thiselton-Dyer to him in one of his letters\r\n(1893), \"the splendid modesty of the big men will be a rarer commodity\r\nin the future. No doubt many of the younger ones know an immense deal;\r\nbut I doubt if many of them will ever exhibit the grasp of great\r\nprinciples which we owe to you and your splendid band of\r\ncontemporaries.\" If this work helps to preserve the records of the\r\ninfluence and achievements of this illustrious and versatile genius and\r\nof the other eminent men who brought the great conception of Evolution\r\nto light, it will surely have justified its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Wallace and Darwin--Early Years\r\n\r\n\r\nAs springs burst forth, now here, now there, on the mountain side, and\r\nfind their way together to the vast ocean, so, at certain periods of\r\nhistory, men destined to become great are born within a few years of\r\neach other, and in the course of life meet and mingle their varied gifts\r\nof soul and intellect for the ultimate benefit of mankind. Between the\r\nyears 1807 and 1825 at least eight illustrious scientists \"saw the\r\nlight\"--Sir Charles Lyell, Sir Joseph Hooker, T.H. Huxley, Herbert\r\nSpencer, John Tyndall, Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace and Louis\r\nAgassiz; whilst amongst statesmen and authors we recall Bismarck,\r\nGladstone, Lincoln, Tennyson, Longfellow, Robert and Elizabeth Browning,\r\nRuskin, John Stuart Blackie and Oliver Wendell Holmes--a wonderful\r\ngalaxy of shining names.\r\n\r\nThe first group is the one with which we are closely associated in this\r\nsection, in which we have brought together the names of Charles Darwin\r\nand Alfred Russel Wallace--between whose births there was a period of\r\nfourteen years, Darwin being born on the 12th of February, 1809, and\r\nWallace on the 8th of January, 1823.\r\n\r\nIn each case we are indebted to an autobiography for an account of their\r\nearly life and work, written almost entirely from memory when at an age\r\nwhich enabled them to take an unbiased view of the past.\r\n\r\nThe autobiography of Darwin was written for the benefit of his family\r\nonly, when he was 67; while the two large volumes entitled \"My Life\"\r\nwere written by Wallace when he was 82, for the pleasure of reviewing\r\nhis long career. These records are characterised by that charming\r\nmodesty and simplicity of life and manner which was so marked a feature\r\nof both men.\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances surrounding their early days there was very little\r\nto indicate the similarity in character and mental gifts which became so\r\nevident in their later years. A brief outline of the hereditary\r\ninfluences immediately affecting them will enable us to trace something\r\nof the essential differences as well as the similarities which marked\r\ntheir scientific and literary attainments.\r\n\r\nThe earliest records of the Darwin family show that in 1500 an ancestor\r\nof that name (though spelt differently) was a substantial yeoman living\r\non the borders of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In the reign of James I.\r\nthe post of Yeoman of the Royal Armoury of Greenwich was granted to\r\nWilliam Darwin, whose son served with the Royalist Army under Charles I.\r\nDuring the Commonwealth, however, he became a barrister of Lincoln's\r\nInn, and later the Recorder of the City of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nPassing over a generation, we find that a brother of Dr. Erasmus Darwin\r\n\"cultivated botany,\" and, when far advanced in years, published a volume\r\nentitled \"Principia Botanica,\" while Erasmus developed into a poet and\r\nphilosopher. The eldest son of the latter \"inherited a strong taste for\r\nvarious branches of science ... and at a very early age collected\r\nspecimens of all kinds.\" The youngest son, Robert Waring, father of\r\nCharles Darwin, became a successful physician, \"a man of genial\r\ntemperament, strong character, fond of society,\" and was the possessor\r\nof great psychic power by which he could readily sum up the characters\r\nof others, and even occasionally read their thoughts. A judicious use of\r\nthis gift was frequently found to be more efficacious than actual\r\nmedicine! To the end of his life Charles Darwin entertained the greatest\r\naffection and reverence for his father, and frequently spoke of him to\r\nhis own children.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief summary of the family history it is easy to perceive the\r\ninherited traits which were combined in the attractive personality of\r\nthe great scientist. From his early forbears came the keen love of sport\r\nand outdoor exercise (to which considerable reference is made in his\r\nyouth and early manhood); the close application of the philosopher; and\r\nthe natural aptitude for collecting specimens of all kinds. To his\r\ngrandfather he was doubtless indebted for his poetic imagination, which,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, pervaded his thoughts and writings, saving\r\nthem from the cold scientific atmosphere which often chills the lay\r\nmind. Lastly, the geniality of his father was strongly evidenced by his\r\nown love of social intercourse, his courtesy and ready wit, whilst the\r\ngentleness of his mother--who unfortunately died when he was 7 years\r\nold--left a delicacy of feeling which pervaded his character to the very\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nNo such sure mental influences, reaching back through several\r\ngenerations, can be traced in the records of the Wallace family,\r\nalthough what is known reveals the source of the dogged perseverance\r\nwith which Wallace faced the immense difficulties met with by all early\r\npioneer travellers, of that happy diversity of mental interests which\r\nhelped to relieve his periods of loneliness and inactivity, and of that\r\nquiet determination to pursue to the utmost limit every idea which\r\nimpressed his mind as containing the germ of a wider and more\r\ncomprehensive truth than had yet been generally recognised and accepted.\r\n\r\nThe innate reticence and shyness of manner which were noticeable all\r\nthrough his life covered a large-heartedness even in the most careful\r\nobservation of facts, and produced a tolerant disposition towards his\r\nfellow-men even when he most disagreed with their views or dogmas. He\r\nwas one of those of whom it may be truly said in hackneyed phrases that\r\nhe was \"born great,\" whilst destined to have \"greatness thrust upon him\"\r\nin the shape of honours which he received with hesitation.\r\n\r\nFrom his autobiography we gather that his father, though dimly tracing\r\nhis descent from the famous Wallace of Stirling, was born at Hanworth,\r\nin Middlesex, where there appears to have been a small colony of\r\nresidents bearing the same name but occupying varied social positions,\r\nfrom admiral to hotel-keeper--the grandfather of Alfred Russel Wallace\r\nbeing known as a victualler. Thomas Vere Wallace was the only son of\r\nthis worthy innkeeper; and, being possessed of somewhat wider ambitions\r\nthan a country life offered, was articled to a solicitor in London, and\r\neventually became an attorney-at-law. On his father's death he inherited\r\na small private income, and, not being of an energetic disposition, he\r\npreferred to live quietly on it instead of continuing his practice. His\r\nmain interests were somewhat literary and artistic, but without any\r\ndefinite aim; and this lack of natural energy, mental and physical,\r\nreappeared in most of the nine children subsequently born to him,\r\nincluding Alfred Russel, who realised that had it not been for the one\r\ndefinite interest which gradually determined his course in life (an\r\ninterest demanding steady perseverance and concentrated thought as well\r\nas physical enterprise), his career might easily have been much less\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly from his father that he acquired an appreciation of\r\ngood literature, as they were in the habit of hearing Shakespeare and\r\nsimilar works read aloud round the fireside on winter nights; whilst\r\nfrom his mother came artistic and business-like instincts--several of\r\nher relatives having been architects of no mean skill, combining with\r\ntheir art sound business qualities which placed them in positions of\r\ncivic authority and brought them the respect due to men of upright\r\ncharacter and good parts.\r\n\r\nDuring the chequered experiences which followed the marriage of Thomas\r\nVere Wallace and Mary Ann Greenell there appears to have been complete\r\nmutual affection and understanding. Although Wallace makes but slight\r\nreference to his mother's character and habits, one may readily conclude\r\nthat her disposition and influence were such as to leave an indelible\r\nimpression for good on the minds of her children, amongst her qualities\r\nbeing a talent for not merely accepting circumstances but in a quiet way\r\nmaking the most of each experience as it came--a talent which we find\r\nrepeated on many occasions in the life of her son Alfred.\r\n\r\nIt is a little curious that each of these great scientists should have\r\nbeen born in a house overlooking a well-known river--the home of the\r\nDarwins standing on the banks of the Severn, at Shrewsbury, and that of\r\nthe Wallaces a stone's throw from the waters of the romantic and\r\nbeautiful Usk, of Monmouthshire.\r\n\r\nWith remarkable clearness Dr. Wallace could recall events and scenes\r\nback to the time when he was only 4 years of age. His first childish\r\nexperiment occurred about that time, due to his being greatly impressed\r\nby the story of the \"Fox and the Pitcher\" in Æsop's Fables. Finding a\r\njar standing in the yard outside their house, he promptly proceeded to\r\npour a small quantity of water into it, and then added a handful of\r\nsmall stones. The water not rising to the surface, as it did in the\r\nfable, he found a spade and scraped up a mixture of earth and pebbles\r\nwhich he added to the stones already in the jar. The result, however,\r\nproving quite unsatisfactory, he gave up the experiment in disgust and\r\nrefused to believe in the truth of the fable. His restless brain and\r\nvivid imagination at this early period is shown by some dreams which he\r\ncould still recall when 82 years of age; whilst the strong impression\r\nleft on his mind by certain localities, with all their graphic detail of\r\nform and colour, enabled him to enjoy over again many of the simple\r\npleasures that made up his early life in the beautiful grounds of the\r\nancient castle in which he used to play.\r\n\r\nThe first great event in his life was the journey undertaken by\r\nferry-boat and stage-coach from Usk to Hertford, to which town the\r\nfamily removed when he was 6 years old, and where they remained for the\r\nnext eight years, until he left school.\r\n\r\nThe morning after their arrival an incident occurred which left its\r\ntrace as of a slender golden thread running throughout the fabric of his\r\nlong life. Alfred, with child-like curiosity about his new surroundings,\r\nwandered into the yard behind their house, and presently heard a voice\r\ncoming from the other side of the low wall, saying, \"Hallo! who are\r\nyou?\" and saw a boy about his own age peering over the top. Explanations\r\nfollowed, and soon, by the aid of two water-butts, the small boys found\r\nthemselves sitting side by side on the top of the wall, holding a long\r\nand intimate conversation. Thus began his friendship with George Silk,\r\nand by some curious trend of circumstances the two families became\r\nneighbours on several subsequent occasions,[1] so that the friendship\r\nwas maintained until in due course the boys separated each to his own\r\nway in life--the one to wander in foreign lands, the other to occupy a\r\nresponsible position at home.\r\n\r\nAfter spending about a year at private schools, Alfred Wallace was sent\r\nwith his brother John to Hertford Grammar School. His recollections of\r\nthese school days are full of interest, especially as contrasted with\r\nthe school life of to-day. He says: \"We went to school even in the\r\nwinter at seven in the morning, and three days a week remained till five\r\nin the afternoon; some artificial light was necessary, and this was\r\neffected by the primitive method of every boy bringing his own candle or\r\ncandle-ends with any kind of candlestick he liked. An empty ink-bottle\r\nwas often used, or the candle was even stuck on to the desk with a\r\nlittle of its own grease. So that it enabled us to learn our lessons or\r\ndo our sums, no one seemed to trouble about how we provided the light.\"\r\n\r\nThough never robust in health, he enjoyed all the usual boyish sports,\r\nespecially such as appealed to his imagination and love of adventure.\r\nNot far from the school a natural cave, formed in a chalky slope and\r\npartially concealed by undergrowth, made an excellent resort for\r\n\"brigands\"; and to this hiding place were brought potatoes and other\r\nprovisions which could be cooked and eaten in primitive fashion, with an\r\nair of secrecy which added to the mystery and attraction of the boyish\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that one destined to become a great traveller and\r\nexplorer should have found the study of geography \"a painful subject.\"\r\nBut this was, as he afterwards understood, entirely due to the method of\r\nteaching then, and sometimes now, in vogue, which made no appeal\r\nwhatever to the imagination by creating a mental picture of the peoples\r\nand nations, or the varied wonders and beauties of nature which\r\ndistinguish one country from another. \"No interesting facts were ever\r\ngiven, no accounts of the country by travellers were ever read, no good\r\nmaps ever given us, nothing but the horrid stream of unintelligible\r\nplace names to be learnt.\" The only subjects in which he considered that\r\nhe gained some valuable grounding at school were Latin, arithmetic, and\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nThis estimate of the value of the grammar-school teaching is echoed in\r\nDarwin's own words when describing his school days at precisely the same\r\nage at Shrewsbury Grammar School, where, he says, \"the school as a means\r\nof education to me was simply a blank.\" It is therefore interesting to\r\nnotice, side by side, as it were, the occupation which each boy found\r\nfor himself out of school hours, and which in both instances proved of\r\nimmense value in their respective careers in later life.\r\n\r\nDarwin, even at this early age, found his \"taste for natural history,\r\nand more especially for collecting,\" well developed. \"I tried,\" he says,\r\n\"to make out the names of plants, and collected all sorts of things,\r\nshells, seals, franks, coins and minerals. The passion for collecting\r\nwhich leads a man to be a systematic naturalist ... was very strong in\r\nme, and was clearly innate, as none of my sisters or brothers ever had\r\nthis taste.\"\r\n\r\nHe also speaks of himself as having been a very \"simple little fellow\"\r\nby the manner in which he was either himself deceived or tried to\r\ndeceive others in a harmless way. As an instance of this, he remembered\r\ndeclaring that he could \"produce variously coloured polyanthuses and\r\nprimroses by watering them with certain coloured fluids,\" though he knew\r\nall the time it was untrue. His feeling of tenderness towards all\r\nanimals and insects is revealed in the fact that he could not\r\nremember--except on one occasion--ever taking more than one egg out of a\r\nbird's nest; and though a keen angler, as soon as he heard that he\r\ncould kill the worms with salt and water he never afterwards \"spitted a\r\nliving worm, though at the expense, probably, of some loss of success!\"\r\n\r\nNothing thwarted young Darwin's intense joy and interest in collecting\r\nminerals and insects, and in watching and making notes upon the habits\r\nof birds. In addition to this wholesome outdoor hobby, the tedium of\r\nschool lessons was relieved for him by reading Shakespeare, Byron and\r\nScott--also a copy of \"Wonders of the World\" which belonged to one of\r\nthe boys, and to which he always attributed his first desire to travel\r\nin remote countries, little thinking how his dreams would be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWhilst Charles Darwin occupied himself with outdoor sport and\r\ncollecting, with a very moderate amount of reading thrown in at\r\nintervals, Wallace, on the contrary, devoured all the books he could\r\nget; and fortunately for him, his father having been appointed Librarian\r\nto the Hertford Town Library, Alfred had access to all the books that\r\nappealed to his mental appetite; and these, especially the historical\r\nnovels, supplemented the lack of interesting history lessons at school,\r\nbesides giving him an insight into many kinds of literature suited to\r\nhis varied tastes and temperament. In addition, however, to the hours\r\nspent in reading, he and his brother John found endless delight in\r\nturning the loft of an outhouse adjoining their yard into a sort of\r\nmechanical factory. Here they contrived, by saving up all their pence\r\n(the only pocket-money that came to them), to make crackers and other\r\nsimple fireworks, and to turn old keys into toy cannon, besides making a\r\nlarge variety of articles for practical domestic purposes. Thus he\r\ncultivated the gift of resourcefulness and self-reliance on which he had\r\nso often to depend when far removed from all civilisation during his\r\ntravels on the Amazon and in the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nA somewhat amusing instance of this is found in a letter to his sister,\r\ndated June 25th, 1855, at a time when he wanted a really capable man for\r\nhis companion, in place of the good-natured but incapable boy Charles,\r\nwhom he had brought with him from London to teach collecting. In reply\r\nto some remarks by his sister about a young man who she thought would be\r\nsuitable, he wrote: \"Do not tell me merely that he is 'a very nice young\r\nman.' Of course he is.... I should like to know whether he can live on\r\nrice and salt fish for a week on occasion.... Can he sleep on a\r\nboard?... Can he walk twenty miles a day? Whether he can work, for there\r\nis sometimes as hard work in collecting as in anything. Can he saw a\r\npiece of wood straight? Ask him to make you anything--a little card box,\r\na wooden peg or bottle-stopper, and see if he makes them neat and\r\nsquare.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter he describes the garden and live stock he had been\r\nable to obtain where he was living; and in yet another he gives a long\r\nlist of his domestic woes and tribulations--which, however, were\r\novercome with the patience inculcated in early life by his hobbies, and\r\nalso by the fact that the family was always more or less in straitened\r\ncircumstances, so that the children were taught to make themselves\r\nuseful in various ways in order to assist their mother in the home.\r\n\r\nAs he grew from childhood into youth, Alfred Wallace's extreme\r\nsensitiveness developed to an almost painful degree. He grew rapidly,\r\nand his unusual height made him still more shy when forced to occupy any\r\nprominent position amongst boys of his own age. During the latter part\r\nof his time at Hertford Grammar School his father was unable to pay the\r\nusual fees, and it was agreed that Alfred should act as pupil teacher\r\nin return for the lessons received. This arrangement, while acceptable\r\non the one hand, caused him actual mental and physical pain on the\r\nother, as it increased his consciousness of the disabilities under which\r\nhe laboured in contrast with most of the other boys of his own age.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 14 Wallace was taken away from school, and until something\r\ncould be definitely decided about his future--as up to the present he\r\nhad no particular bent in any one direction--he was sent to London to\r\nlive with his brother John, who was then working for a master builder in\r\nthe vicinity of Tottenham Court Road. This was in January, 1837, and it\r\nwas during the following summer that he joined his other brother,\r\nWilliam, at Barton-on-the-Clay, Bedfordshire, and began land surveying.\r\nIn the meantime, while in London, he had been brought very closely into\r\ncontact with the economics and ethics of Robert Owen, the well-known\r\nSocialist; and although very young in years he was so deeply impressed\r\nwith the reasonableness and practical outcome of these theories that,\r\nthough considerably modified as time went on, they formed the foundation\r\nfor his own writings on Socialism and allied subjects in after years.\r\n\r\nAs one of our aims in this section is to suggest an outline of the\r\ncontrasting influences governing the early lives of Wallace and Darwin,\r\nit is interesting to note that at the ages of 14 and 16 respectively,\r\nand immediately on leaving school, they came under the first definite\r\nmental influence which was to shape their future thought and action. Yet\r\nhow totally different from Wallace's trials as a pupil teacher was the\r\nremoval of Darwin from Dr. Butler's school at Shrewsbury because \"he was\r\ndoing no good\" there, and his father thought it was \"time he settled\r\ndown to his medical study in Edinburgh,\" never heeding the fact that\r\nhis son had already one passion in life, apart from \"shooting, dogs, and\r\nrat-catching,\" which stood a very good chance of saving him from\r\nbecoming the disgrace to the family that his good father feared. So that\r\nwhile Wallace was imbibing his first lessons in Socialism at 14 years of\r\nage, Darwin at 16 found himself merely enduring, with a feeling of\r\ndisgust, Dr. Duncan's lectures, which were \"something fearful to\r\nremember,\" on materia medica at eight o'clock on a winter's morning,\r\nand, worse still, Dr. Munro's lectures on human anatomy, which were \"as\r\ndull as he was himself.\" Yet he always deeply regretted not having been\r\nurged to practise dissection, because of the invaluable aid it would\r\nhave been to him as a naturalist.\r\n\r\nBy mental instinct, however, Darwin soon found himself studying marine\r\nzoology and other branches of natural science. This was in a large\r\nmeasure due to his intimacy with Dr. Grant, who, in a later article on\r\nFlustra, made some allusion to a paper read by Darwin before the Linnean\r\nSociety on a small discovery which he had made by the aid of a \"wretched\r\nmicroscope\" to the effect that the so-called ova of Flustra were really\r\nlarvæ and had the power of independent action by means of cilia.\r\n\r\nDuring his second year in Edinburgh he attended Jameson's lectures on\r\ngeology and zoology, but found them so \"incredibly dull\" that he\r\ndetermined never to study the science.\r\n\r\nThen came the final move which, all unknowingly, was to lead Darwin into\r\nthe pursuit of a science which up to that time had only been a hobby and\r\nnot in any sense the serious profession of his life. But again how wide\r\nthe difference between his change from Edinburgh to Cambridge, and that\r\nof Wallace from a month's association with a working-class Socialistic\r\ncommunity in London to land surveying under the simplest rural\r\nconditions prevalent amongst the respectable labouring farmers of\r\nBedfordshire--Darwin to the culture and privileges of a great University\r\nwith the object of becoming a clergyman, and Wallace taking the first\r\nroad that offered towards earning a living, with no thought as to the\r\nultimate outcome of this life in the open and the systematic observation\r\nof soils and land formation.\r\n\r\nBut the inherent tendencies of Darwin's nature drew him away from\r\ntheology to the study of geology, entomology and botany. The ensuing\r\nfour years at Cambridge were very happy ones. While fortunate in being\r\nable to follow his various mental and scientific pursuits with the\r\nfreedom which a good social and financial position secured for him, he\r\nfound himself by a natural seriousness of manner, balanced by a cheerful\r\ntemperament and love of sport, the friend and companion of men many\r\nyears his seniors and holding positions of authority in the world of\r\nscience. Amongst these the name of Professor Henslow will always take\r\nprecedence. \"This friendship,\" says Darwin, \"influenced my whole career\r\nmore than any other.\" Henslow's extensive knowledge of botany, geology,\r\nentomology, chemistry and mineralogy, added to his sincere and\r\nattractive personality, well-balanced mind and excellent judgment,\r\nformed a strong and effective bias in the direction Darwin was destined\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\nApart, however, from the strong personal influence of Henslow, Sedgwick\r\nand others with whom he came much in contact, two books which he read at\r\nthis time aroused his \"burning zeal to add the most humble contribution\r\nto the noble structure of Natural Science\"; these were Sir J. Herschel's\r\n\"Introduction to the Study of Natural Philosophy,\" and Humboldt's\r\n\"Personal Narrative.\" Indeed, so fascinated was he by the description\r\ngiven of Teneriffe in the latter that he at once set about a plan\r\nwhereby he might spend a holiday, with Henslow, in that locality, a\r\nholiday which was, indeed, to form part of his famous voyage.\r\n\r\nBy means of his explorations in the neighbourhood of Cambridge, and one\r\nor two visits to North Wales, Darwin's experimental knowledge of geology\r\nand allied sciences was considerably increased. In his zeal for\r\ncollecting beetles he employed a labourer to \"scrape the moss off old\r\ntrees in winter, and place it in a bag, and likewise to collect the\r\nrubbish at the bottom of the barges in which reeds were brought from the\r\nfens, and thus ... got some very rare species.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the summer vacation of 1831, at the personal request of Henslow,\r\nhe accompanied Professor Sedgwick on a geological tour in North Wales.\r\nIn order, no doubt, to give him some independent experience, Sedgwick\r\nsent Darwin on a line parallel with his own, telling him to bring back\r\nspecimens of the rocks and to mark the stratification on a map. In later\r\nyears Darwin was amazed to find how much both of them had failed to\r\nobserve, \"yet these phenomena were so conspicuous that ... a house burnt\r\ndown by fire could not tell its story more plainly than did the valley\r\nof Cwm Idwal.\"\r\n\r\nThis tour was the introduction to a momentous change in his life. On\r\nreturning to Shrewsbury he found a letter awaiting him which contained\r\nthe offer of a voyage in H.M.S. _Beagle_. But owing to several\r\nobjections raised by Dr. Darwin, he wrote and declined the offer; and if\r\nit had not been for the immediate intervention of his uncle, Mr. Josiah\r\nWedgwood (to whose house he went the following day to begin the shooting\r\nseason), who took quite a different view of the proposition, the\r\n\"Journal of Researches during the Voyage of H.M.S. _Beagle_,\" by Charles\r\nDarwin, would never have been written.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, after much preparation and many delays, the\r\n_Beagle_ sailed from Plymouth on December 27th, 1831, and five years\r\nelapsed before Darwin set foot again on English soil. The period,\r\ntherefore, in Darwin's life which we find covered by his term at\r\nEdinburgh and Cambridge, until at the age of 22 he found himself\r\nsuddenly launched on an entirely new experience full of adventure and\r\nfresh association, was spent by Wallace in a somewhat similar manner in\r\nso far as his outward objective in life was more or less distinct from\r\nthe pursuits which gradually dawned upon his horizon, though they were\r\nfollowed as a \"thing apart\" and not as an ultimate end.\r\n\r\nWith Wallace's removal into Bedfordshire an entirely new life opened up\r\nbefore him. His health, never very good, rapidly improved; both brain\r\nand eye were trained to practical observations which proved eminently\r\nvaluable. His descriptions of the people with whom he came in contact\r\nduring these years of country life reveal the quiet toleration of the\r\nfaults and foibles of others, not devoid of the keen sense of humour and\r\njustice which characterised his lifelong attitude towards his\r\nfellow-men.\r\n\r\nThe many interests of his new life, together with the use of a pocket\r\nsextant, prompted him to make various experiments for himself. The only\r\nsources from which he could obtain helpful information, however, were\r\nsome cheap elementary books on mechanics and optics which he procured\r\nfrom the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge; these he studied\r\nand \"puzzled over\" for several years. \"Having no friends of my own age,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"I occupied myself with various pursuits in which I had begun\r\nto take an interest. Having learnt the use of the sextant in surveying,\r\nand my brother having a book on Nautical Astronomy, I practised a few of\r\nthe simpler observations. Among these were determining the meridian by\r\nequal altitudes of the sun, and also by the pole-star at its upper or\r\nlower culmination; finding the latitude by the meridian altitude of the\r\nsun, or of some of the principal stars; and making a rude sundial by\r\nerecting a gnomon towards the pole. For these simple calculations I had\r\nHannay and Dietrichsen's Almanac, a copious publication which gave all\r\nthe important data in the Nautical Almanac, besides much other\r\ninteresting matter useful for the astronomical amateur or the ordinary\r\nnavigator. I also tried to make a telescope by purchasing a lens of\r\nabout 2 ft. focus at an optician's in Swansea, fixing it in a paper tube\r\nand using the eye-piece of a small opera-glass. With it I was able to\r\nobserve the moon and Jupiter's satellites, and some of the larger\r\nstar-clusters; but, of course, very imperfectly. Yet it served to\r\nincrease my interest in astronomy, and to induce me to study with some\r\ncare the various methods of construction of the more important\r\nastronomical instruments; and it also led me throughout my life to be\r\ndeeply interested in the grand onward march of astronomical\r\ndiscovery.\"[2]\r\n\r\nAt the same time Wallace became attracted by, and interested in, the\r\nflowers, shrubs and trees growing in that part of Bedfordshire, and he\r\nacquired some elementary knowledge of zoology. \"It was,\" he writes,\r\n\"while living at Barton that I obtained my first information that there\r\nwas such a science as geology.... My brother, like most land-surveyors,\r\nwas something of a geologist, and he showed me the fossil oysters of the\r\ngenus Gryphæa and the Belemnites ... and several other fossils which\r\nwere abundant in the chalk and gravel around Barton.... It was here,\r\ntoo, that during my solitary rambles I first began to feel the influence\r\nof nature and to wish to know more of the various flowers, shrubs and\r\ntrees I daily met with, but of which for the most part I did not even\r\nknow the English names. At that time I hardly realised that there was\r\nsuch a science as systematic botany, that every flower and every meanest\r\nand most insignificant weed had been accurately described and\r\nclassified, and that there was any kind of system or order in the\r\nendless variety of plants and animals which I knew existed. This wish to\r\nknow the names of wild plants, to be able to speak ... about them, had\r\narisen from a chance remark I had overheard about a year before. A lady\r\n... whom we knew at Hertford, was talking to some friends in the street\r\nwhen I and my father met them ... [and] I heard the lady say, 'We found\r\nquite a rarity the other day--the Monotropa; it had not been found here\r\nbefore.' This I pondered over, and wondered what the Monotropa was. All\r\nmy father could tell me was that it was a rare plant; and I thought how\r\nnice it must be to know the names of rare plants when you found\r\nthem.\"[3]\r\n\r\nOne can picture the tall quiet boy going on these solitary rambles, his\r\neye becoming gradually quickened to perceive new forms in nature,\r\ncontrasting them one with another, and beginning to ponder over the\r\n_cause_ which led to the diverse formation and colouring of leaves\r\napparently of the same family.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1841, four years later, that he heard of, and at once\r\nprocured, a book published at a shilling by the S.P.C.K. (the title of\r\nwhich he could not recall in after years), to which he owed his first\r\nscientific glimmerings of the vast study of botany. The next step was to\r\nprocure, at much self-sacrifice, Lindley's \"Elements of Botany,\"\r\npublished at half a guinea, which to his immense disappointment he found\r\nof very little use, as it did not deal with British plants! His\r\ndisappointment was lessened, however, by the loan from a Mr. Hayward of\r\nLondon's \"Encyclopedia of Plants,\" and it was with the help of these two\r\nbooks that he made his first classification of the specimens which he\r\nhad collected and carefully kept during the few preceding years.\r\n\r\n\"It must be remembered,\" he says in \"My Life,\" \"that my ignorance of\r\nplants at this time was extreme. I knew the wild rose, bramble,\r\nhawthorn, buttercup, poppy, daisy and foxglove, and a very few others\r\nequally common.... I knew nothing whatever as to genera and species, nor\r\nof the large number of distinct forms related to each and grouped into\r\nnatural orders. My delight, therefore, was great when I was ... able to\r\nidentify the charming little eyebright, the strange-looking cow-wheat\r\nand louse-wort, the handsome mullein and the pretty creeping toad-flax,\r\nand to find that all of them, as well as the lordly foxglove, formed\r\nparts of one great natural order, and that under all their superficial\r\ndiversity of form was a similarity of structure which, when once clearly\r\nunderstood, enabled me to locate each fresh species with greater ease.\"\r\nThis, however, was not sufficient, and the last step was to form a\r\nherbarium.\r\n\r\n\"I soon found,\" he wrote, \"that by merely identifying the plants I found\r\nin my walks I lost much time in gathering the same species several\r\ntimes, and even then not being always quite sure that I had found the\r\nsame plant before. I therefore began to form a herbarium, collecting\r\ngood specimens and drying them carefully between drying papers and a\r\ncouple of boards weighted with books or stones.... I first named the\r\nspecies as nearly as I could do so, and then laid them out to be pressed\r\nand dried. At such times,\" he continues--and I have quoted the passage\r\nfor the sake of this revealing confession--\"I experienced the joy which\r\nevery discovery of a new form of life gives to the lover of nature,\r\nalmost equal to those raptures which I afterwards felt at every capture\r\nof new butterflies on the Amazon, or at the constant stream of new\r\nspecies of birds, beetles and butterflies in Borneo, the Moluccas, and\r\nthe Aru Islands.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAnything in the shape of gardening papers and catalogues which came in\r\nhis way was eagerly read, and to this source he owed his first interest\r\nin the fascinating orchid.\r\n\r\n\"A catalogue published by a great nurseryman in Bristol ... contained a\r\nnumber of tropical orchids, of whose wonderful variety and beauty I had\r\nobtained some idea from the woodcuts in Loudon's 'Encyclopedia.' The\r\nfirst epiphytal orchid I ever saw was at a flower show in Swansea ...\r\nwhich caused in me a thrill of enjoyment which no other plant in the\r\nshow produced. My interest in this wonderful order of plants was further\r\nenhanced by reading in the _Gardener's Chronicle_ an article by Dr.\r\nLindley on one of the London flower shows, where there was a good\r\ndisplay of orchids, in which ... he added, 'and _Dendrobium Devonianum_,\r\ntoo delicate and beautiful for a flower of earth.' This and other\r\nreferences ... gave them, in my mind, a weird and mysterious charm ...\r\nwhich, I believe, had its share in producing that longing for the\r\ntropics which a few years later was satisfied in the equatorial forests\r\nof the Amazon.\"[5]\r\n\r\nFor a brief period, when there was a lull in the surveying business and\r\nhis prospects of continuing in this profession looked uncertain, he\r\ntried watchmaking, and would probably--though not by choice--have been\r\napprenticed to it but for an unexpected circumstance which caused his\r\nmaster to give up his business. Alfred gladly, when the occasion\r\noffered, returned to his outdoor life, which had begun to make the\r\nstrongest appeal to him, stronger, perhaps, than he was really aware.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1844 another break occurred, due to the sudden falling off of\r\nland surveying as a profitable business. His brother could no longer\r\nafford to keep him as assistant, finding it indeed difficult to obtain\r\nsufficient employment for himself. As Wallace knew no other trade or\r\nprofession, the only course which occurred to his mind as possible by\r\nwhich to earn a living was to get a post as school teacher.\r\n\r\nAfter one or two rather amusing experiences, he eventually found himself\r\nin very congenial surroundings under the Rev. Abraham Hill, headmaster\r\nof the Collegiate School at Leicester. Here he stayed for a little more\r\nthan a year, during which time--in addition to his school work and a\r\nconsiderable amount of hard reading on subjects to which he had not\r\nhitherto been able to devote himself--he was led to become greatly\r\ninterested in phrenology and mesmerism, and before long found himself\r\nsomething of an expert in giving mesmeric demonstrations before small\r\naudiences. Phrenology, he believed, proved of much value in determining\r\nhis own characteristics, good and bad, and in guiding him to a wise use\r\nof the faculties which made for his ultimate success; while his\r\nintroduction to mesmerism had not a little to do with his becoming\r\ninterested and finally convinced of the part played by spiritualistic\r\nforces and agencies in human life.\r\n\r\nThe most important event, however, during this year at Leicester was his\r\nmeeting with H.W. Bates, through whom he was introduced to the absorbing\r\nstudy of beetles and butterflies, the link which culminated in their\r\nmutual exploration of the Amazon. It is curious that Wallace retained no\r\ndistinct recollection of how or when he met Bates for the first time,\r\nbut thought that \"he heard him mentioned as an enthusiastic\r\nentomologist and met him at the Library.\" Bates was at this time\r\nemployed by his father, who was a hosiery manufacturer, and he could\r\ntherefore only devote his spare time to collecting beetles in the\r\nsurrounding neighbourhood. The friendship brought new interests into\r\nboth lives, and though Wallace was obliged a few months later to leave\r\nLeicester and return to his old work of surveying (owing to the sudden\r\ndeath of his brother William, whose business affairs were left in an\r\nunsatisfactory condition and needed personal attention), he no longer\r\nfound in it the satisfaction he had previously experienced, and his\r\nletters to Bates expressed the desire to strike out on some new line,\r\none which would satisfy his craving for a definite pursuit in the\r\ndirection of natural science.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about the autumn of 1847, Bates paid a visit to Wallace at\r\nNeath, and the plan to go to the Amazon which had been slowly forming\r\nitself at length took shape, due to the perusal of a little book\r\nentitled \"A Voyage up the River Amazon,\" by W.H. Edwards. Further\r\ninvestigations showed that this would be particularly advantageous, as\r\nthe district had only been explored by the German zoologist, von Spix,\r\nand the botanist von Martins, in 1817-20, and subsequently by Count de\r\nCastelnau.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval we find, in a letter to Bates, the following\r\nallusion to Darwin, which is the first record of Wallace's high estimate\r\nof the man with whom his own name was to be dramatically associated ten\r\nyears later. \"I first,\" he says, \"read Darwin's Journal three or four\r\nyears ago, and have lately re-read it. As the journal of a scientific\r\ntraveller it is second only to Humboldt's Narrative; as a work of\r\ngeneral interest, perhaps superior to it. He is an ardent admirer and\r\nmost able supporter of Mr. Lyell's views. His style of writing I very\r\nmuch admire, so free from all labour, or egotism, yet so full of\r\ninterest and original thought.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe early part of 1848 was occupied in making arrangements with Mr.\r\nSamuel Stevens, of King Street, Covent Garden, to act as their agent in\r\ndisposing of a duplicate collection of specimens which they proposed\r\nsending home; by this means paying their expenses during the time they\r\nwere away, any surplus being invested against their return. This and\r\nother matters being satisfactorily settled, they eventually sailed from\r\nLiverpool on April 20th in a barque of 192 tons, said to be \"a very fast\r\nsailer,\" which proved to be correct. On arriving at Para about a month\r\nlater, they immediately set about finding a house, learning something of\r\nthe language, the habits of the people amongst whom they had come to\r\nlive, and making short excursions into the forest before starting on\r\nlonger and more trying explorations up country.\r\n\r\nWallace's previous vivid imaginings of what life in the tropics would\r\nmean, so far as the surpassing beauty of nature was concerned, were not\r\nimmediately fulfilled. As a starting-point, however, Para had many\r\nadvantages. Besides the pleasant climate, the country for some hundreds\r\nof miles was found to be nearly level at an elevation of about 30 or 40\r\nft. above the river; the first distinct rise occurring some 150 miles up\r\nthe river Tocantins, south-west of Para; the whole district was\r\nintersected by streams, with cross channels connecting them, access by\r\nthis means being comparatively easy to villages and estates lying\r\nfarther inland.\r\n\r\nBefore making an extensive excursion into the interior, he spent some\r\ntime on the larger islands at the mouth of the Amazon, on one of which\r\nhe immediately noticed the scarcity of trees, while \"the abundance of\r\nevery kind of animal life crowded into a small space was here very\r\nstriking, compared with the sparse manner in which it is scattered in\r\nthe virgin forests. It seems to force us to the conclusion that the\r\nluxuriance of tropical vegetation is not favourable to the production of\r\nanimal life. The plains are always more thickly peopled than the forest;\r\nand a temperate zone, as has been pointed out by Mr. Darwin, seems\r\nbetter adapted to the support of large land animals than the tropics.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the fact that at the very early age of 14\r\nWallace had imbibed his first ideas of Socialism, or how the\r\n\"commonwealth\" of a people or nation was the outcome of cause and\r\neffect, largely due to the form of government, political economy and\r\nprogressive commerce best suited to any individual State or country. The\r\nseed took deep root, and during the years spent for the most part\r\namongst an agricultural people in England and Wales his interest in\r\nthese questions had been quickened by observation and intelligent\r\ninquiry. It is no wonder, therefore, that during the whole of his\r\ntravels we find many intimate references to such matters regarding the\r\nlocality in which he happened to find himself, but which can only be\r\nnoticed in a very casual manner in this section. For instance, he soon\r\ndiscovered that the climate and soil round Para conduced to the\r\ncultivation of almost every kind of food, such as cocoa, coffee, sugar,\r\nfarinha (the universal bread of the country) from the mandioca plant,\r\nwith vegetables and fruits in inexhaustible variety; while the articles\r\nof export included india-rubber, Brazil nuts, and piassaba (the coarse,\r\nstiff fibre of a palm, used for making brooms for street sweeping), as\r\nwell as sarsaparilla, balsam-capivi, and a few other drugs.\r\n\r\nThe utter lack of initiative, or even ordinary interest, in making the\r\nmost of the opportunities lying at hand, struck him again and again as\r\nhe went from place to place and was entertained hospitably by hosts of\r\nvarious nationalities; until at times the impression is conveyed that\r\napart from his initial interest as a naturalist, a longing seized him to\r\narouse those who were primarily responsible for these conditions out of\r\nthe apathy into which they had fallen, and to make them realise the\r\nlarger pleasure which life offers to those who recognise the\r\nopportunities at hand, not only for their own advancement but also for\r\nthe benefit of those placed under their control. All of which we find\r\nhappily illustrated during his visit to Sarawak, in the Malay\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nThe whole of these four years was crowded with valuable experiences of\r\none sort and another. Some of the most toilsome journeys proved only a\r\ndisappointment, while others brought success beyond his most sanguine\r\ndreams. At the end of two years it was agreed between himself and Bates\r\nthat they should separate, Wallace doing the northern parts and\r\ntributaries of the Amazon, and Bates the main stream, which, from the\r\nfork of the Rio Negro, is called the Upper Amazon, or the Solimoes. By\r\nthis arrangement they were able to cover more ground, besides devoting\r\nthemselves to the special goal of research on which each was bent.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Wallace's younger brother, Herbert, had come out to\r\njoin him, and for some time their journeys were made conjointly; but\r\nfinding that his brother was not temperamentally fitted to become a\r\nnaturalist, it was decided that he should return to England.\r\nAccordingly, they parted at Barra when Wallace started on his long\r\njourney up the Rio Negro, the duration of which was uncertain; and it\r\nwas not until many months after the sad event that he heard the\r\ndistressing news that Herbert had died of yellow fever on the eve of his\r\ndeparture from Para for home. Fortunately, Bates was in Para at the\r\ntime, and did what he could for the boy until stricken down himself with\r\nthe same sickness, from which, however, his stronger constitution\r\nenabled him to recover.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most eventful and memorable journey during this period was\r\nthe exploration of the Uaupés River, of which Wallace wrote nearly sixty\r\nyears later: \"So far as I have heard, no English traveller has to this\r\nday ascended the Uaupés River so far as I did, and no collector has\r\nstayed at any time at Javita, or has even passed through it.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a communication received from the Royal Geographical Society it\r\nappears that the first complete survey of this river (a compass traverse\r\nsupplemented by astronomical observations) was made (1907-8) by Dr.\r\nHamilton Rice, starting from the side of Colombia, and tracing the whole\r\ncourse of the river from a point near the source of its head-stream. The\r\nresult showed that the general course of the lower river was much as\r\nrepresented by Wallace, though considerable corrections were necessary\r\nboth in latitude and longitude. \"I am assured by authorities on the Rio\r\nNegro region,\" writes Dr. Scott Keltie to Mr. W.G. Wallace, under date\r\nMay 21, 1915, \"that your father's work still holds good.\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1852, Wallace returned to Para, and sailed for England the\r\nfollowing July. The ship took fire at sea, and all his treasures (not\r\npreviously sent to England) were unhappily lost. Ten days and nights\r\nwere spent in an open boat before another vessel picked them up, and in\r\ndescribing this terrible experience he says: \"When the danger appeared\r\npast I began to feel the greatness of my loss. With what pleasure had I\r\nlooked upon every rare and curious insect I had added to my collection!\r\nHow many times, when almost overcome by the ague, had I crawled into the\r\nforest and been rewarded by some unknown and beautiful species! How\r\nmany places, which no European foot but my own had trodden, would have\r\nbeen recalled to my memory by the rare birds and insects they had\r\nfurnished to my collection! How many weary days and weeks had I passed,\r\nupheld only by the fond hope of bringing home many new and beautiful\r\nforms from these wild regions ... which would prove that I had not\r\nwasted the advantage I had enjoyed, and would give me occupation and\r\namusement for many years to come! And now ... I had not one specimen to\r\nillustrate the unknown lands I had trod, or to call back the\r\nrecollection of the wild scenes I had beheld! But such regrets were vain\r\n... and I tried to occupy myself with the state of things which actually\r\nexisted.\"[7]\r\n\r\nOn reaching London, Wallace took a house in Upper Albany Street, where\r\nhis mother and his married sister (Mrs. Sims), with her husband, a\r\nphotographer, came to live with him. The next eighteen months were fully\r\noccupied with sorting and arranging such collections as had previously\r\nreached England; writing his book of travels up the Amazon and Rio Negro\r\n(published in the autumn of 1853), and a little book on the palm trees\r\nbased on a number of fine pencil sketches he had preserved in a tin box,\r\nthe only thing saved from the wreck.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the most vivid impressions left on his mind, apart from\r\npurely scientific results, after his four years in South America, he\r\nwrote that the feature which he could never think of without delight was\r\n\"the wonderful variety and exquisite beauty of the butterflies and birds\r\n... ever new and beautiful, strange and even mysterious,\" so that he\r\ncould \"hardly recall them without a thrill of admiration and wonder.\"\r\nBut \"the most unexpected sensation of surprise and delight was my first\r\nmeeting and living with man in a state of nature--with absolute\r\nuncontaminated savages!... and the surprise of it was that I did not\r\nexpect to be at all so surprised.... These true wild Indians of the\r\nUaupés ... had nothing that we call clothes; they had peculiar\r\nornaments, tribal marks, etc.; they all carried tools or weapons of\r\ntheir own manufacture.... But more than all, their whole aspect and\r\nmanner was different--they were all going about their own work or\r\npleasure, which had nothing to do with white men or their ways; they\r\nwalked with the free step of the independent forest-dweller, and, except\r\nthe few that were known to my companion, paid no attention whatever to\r\nus, mere strangers of an alien race! In every detail they were original\r\nand self-sustaining as are the wild animals of the forest, absolutely\r\nindependent of civilisation.... I could not have believed that there\r\nwould have been so much difference in the aspect of the same people in\r\ntheir native state and when living under European supervision. The true\r\ndenizen of the Amazonian forest, like the forest itself, is unique and\r\nnot to be forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing \"impressions\" recall forcibly those expressed by Darwin in\r\nsimilar terms at the close of his \"Journal\": \"Delight ... is a weak term\r\nto express the feelings of a naturalist who, for the first time, has\r\nwandered by himself in a Brazilian forest. The elegance of the grasses,\r\nthe novelty of the parasitical plants, the beauty of the flowers, the\r\nglossy green of the foliage ... the general luxuriance of the\r\nvegetation, filled me with admiration. A paradoxical mixture of sound\r\nand silence pervades the shady parts of the wood ... yet within the\r\nrecesses ... a universal silence appears to reign ... such a day as this\r\nbrings with it a deeper pleasure than he (a naturalist) can ever hope to\r\nexperience again,\"[8] And in another place: \"Among the scenes which are\r\ndeeply impressed on my mind, none can exceed in sublimity the primeval\r\nforests undefaced by the hand of man; ... temples filled with the\r\nvarious productions of the God of Nature; ... no one can stand in these\r\nsolitudes unmoved, and not feel that there is more in man than the mere\r\nbreath of his body.\"[9]\r\n\r\nIn complete contrast to the forest, the bare, treeless, and uninhabited\r\nplains of Patagonia \"frequently crossed before\" Darwin's eyes. Why, he\r\ncould not understand, except that, being so \"boundless,\" they left \"free\r\nscope for the imagination.\"\r\n\r\nAs these travels,[10] undertaken at comparatively the same age, represent\r\nthe foundation upon which their scientific work and theories were based\r\nduring the long years which followed, a glance at the conditions\r\ngoverning the separate expeditions--both mental and physical--may be of\r\nsome value. The most obvious difference lies, perhaps, in the fact that\r\nDarwin was free from the thought of having to \"pay his way\" by the\r\nimmediate result of his efforts, and likewise from all care and anxiety\r\nregarding domestic concerns; the latter being provided for him when on\r\nboard the _Beagle_, or arranged by those who accompanied him on his\r\ntravels overland and by river. The elimination of these minor cares\r\ntended to leave his mind free and open to absorb and speculate at\r\ncomparative leisure upon all the strange phenomena which presented\r\nthemselves throughout the long voyage.\r\n\r\nA further point of interest in determining the ultimate gain or loss\r\nlies in the fact that Darwin's private excursions had to be somewhat\r\nsubservient to the movements of the _Beagle_ under the command of\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy. This, in all probability, was beneficial to one of his\r\ntemperament--unaccustomed to be greatly restricted by outward\r\ncircumstances or conditions, though never flagrantly (or, perhaps,\r\nconsciously) going against them. The same applies in a measure to\r\nWallace, who, on more than one occasion, confessed his tendency to a\r\nfeeling of semi-idleness and dislike to any form of enforced physical\r\nexertion; but as every detail, involving constant forethought and\r\narrangement, as well as the execution, devolved upon himself, the latent\r\npowers of methodical perseverance, which never failed him, no matter\r\nwhat difficulties barred his way, were called forth. Darwin's estimate\r\nof the \"habit of mind\" forced upon himself during this period may not\r\ninaptly be applied to both men: \"Everything about which I thought or\r\nread was made to bear directly on what I had seen, or was likely to see;\r\nand this habit of mind was continued during the five years of the\r\nvoyage. I feel sure that it was this training which enabled me to do\r\nwhatever I have done in science.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be further assumed that Darwin was better equipped mentally--from\r\na scientific point of view--owing to his personal intercourse with\r\neminent scientific men previous to his assuming this responsible\r\nposition. Wallace, on the contrary, had practically little beyond\r\nbook-knowledge and such experience as he had been able to gain by\r\nsolitary wanderings in the localities in which he had, by circumstances,\r\nbeen forced to reside. His plan of operations must, therefore, have been\r\nlargely modified and adapted as time went on, and as his finances\r\nallowed. To both, therefore, credit is due for the adaptability evinced\r\nunder conditions not always congenial or conducive to the pursuits they\r\nhad undertaken.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fact is not definitely stated by Wallace, it may readily be\r\ninferred that the idea of making this the starting-point of a new life\r\nwas clearly in his mind; while Darwin simply accepted the opportunity\r\nwhen it came, and was only brought to a consciousness of its full\r\nmeaning and bearing on his future career whilst studying the geological\r\naspect of Santiago when \"the line of white rock revealed a new and\r\nimportant fact,\" namely, that there had been afterwards subsidence round\r\nthe craters, which had since been in action and had poured forth lava.\r\n\"It then,\" he says, \"first dawned on me that I might perhaps write a\r\nbook on the geology of the various countries visited, and this made me\r\nthrill with delight. That was a memorable hour to me; and how distinctly\r\nI can call to mind the low cliff of lava, beneath which I rested, with\r\nthe sun glaring hot, a few strange desert plants growing near, and with\r\nliving corals in the tidal pools at my feet!\"[11]\r\n\r\nAnother point of comparison lies in the fact that at no time did the\r\nstudy of man or human nature, from the metaphysical and psychological\r\npoint of view, appeal to Darwin as it did to Wallace; and this being so,\r\nthe similarity between the impression made on them individually by their\r\nfirst contact with primitive human beings is of some interest.\r\n\r\nWallace's words have already been quoted; here are Darwin's: \"Nothing is\r\nmore certain to create astonishment than the first sight in his native\r\nhaunt of a barbarian, of man in his lowest and most savage state. One\r\nasks: 'Could our progenitors have been men like these--men whose very\r\nsigns and expressions are less intelligible to us than those of the\r\ndomesticated animals; men who do not possess the instinct of those\r\nanimals, nor yet appear to boast of human reason, or at least of arts\r\nconsequent on that reason?' I do not believe it is possible to describe\r\nor paint the difference between a savage and civilised man. It is the\r\ndifference between a wild and tame animal.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe last words suggest the seed-thought eventually to be enlarged in\r\n\"The Descent of Man,\" and there is also perhaps a subtle suggestion of\r\nthe points in which Wallace differed from Darwin when the time came for\r\nthem to discuss this important section of the theory of Evolution. It\r\nneeded, however, the further eight years spent by Wallace in the Malay\r\nArchipelago to bring about a much wider knowledge of nature-science\r\nbefore he was prepared in any way to assume the position of exponent of\r\ntheories not seriously thought of previously in the scientific world.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1853, on the completion of his \"Travels on the Amazon\r\nand Rio Negro,\" Wallace paid his first visit to Switzerland, on a\r\nwalking tour in company with his friend George Silk. On his return, and\r\nduring the winter months, he was constant in his attendance at the\r\nmeetings of the Entomological and Zoological Societies. It was at one of\r\nthese evening gatherings that he first met Huxley, and he also had a\r\nvague recollection of once meeting and speaking to Darwin at the British\r\nMuseum. Had it not been for his extreme shyness of disposition, and\r\n(according to his own estimation) \"lack of conversational powers,\" he\r\nwould doubtless have become far more widely known, and have enjoyed the\r\nfriendship of not a few of the eminent men who shared his interests,\r\nduring this interval before starting on his journey to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt was due to his close study of the Insect and Bird Departments of the\r\nBritish Museum that he decided on Singapore as a new starting-point for\r\nhis natural history collections. As the region was generally healthy,\r\nand no part of it (with the exception of the Island of Java) had been\r\nexplored, it offered unlimited attractions for his special work. But as\r\nthe journey out would be an expensive one, he was advised to lay his\r\nplans before Sir Roderick Murchison, then President of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society, and it was through his kindly interest and\r\npersonal application to the Government that a passage was provided in\r\none of the P. and O. boats going to Singapore. He left early in 1854.\r\nArrived at Singapore, an entirely new world opened up before him. New\r\npeoples and customs thronged on all hands, a medley of nationalities\r\nsuch as can only be seen in the East, where, even to-day, and though\r\nforming part of one large community, each section preserves its native\r\ndress, customs and religious habits. After spending some time at\r\nSingapore he moved from place to place, but finally decided upon making\r\nTernate his head-quarters, as he discovered a comfortable bungalow, not\r\ntoo large, and adaptable in every way as a place in which to collect and\r\nprepare his specimens between the many excursions to other parts of the\r\nArchipelago. The name is now indelibly associated with that particular\r\nvisit which ended after a trying journey in an attack of intermittent\r\nfever and general prostration, during which he first conceived the idea\r\nwhich has made Ternate famous in the history of natural science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.R. WALLACE Singapore, 1862]\r\n\r\nOne or two points in the following letters recall certain contrasts\r\nsimilar to those already drawn between Darwin's impression of places and\r\npeople and those made on the mind of Wallace by practically the same\r\nconditions. A typical instance is found in their estimate of the life\r\nand work of the missionaries whom they met and from whom they received\r\nthe warmest hospitality. Their experience included both Protestant and\r\nRoman Catholic, and from Darwin's account the former appeared to him to\r\nhave the more civilising effect on the people, not only from a\r\nreligious but also from the economic and industrial points of view.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Journal\" (p. 419) we find a detailed account of a visit to the\r\nmissionary settlement at Waimate, New Zealand. After describing the\r\nfamiliar English appearance of the whole surroundings, he adds: \"All\r\nthis is very surprising when it is considered that five years ago\r\nnothing but the fern flourished here. Moreover, native workmanship,\r\ntaught by these missionaries, has effected this change--the lesson of\r\nthe missionary is the enchanter's wand. The house had been built, the\r\nwindows framed, the fields ploughed, and even the trees grafted, by the\r\nNew Zealander. When I looked at the whole scene it was admirable. It was\r\nnot that England was brought vividly before my mind; ... nor was it the\r\ntriumphant feeling at seeing what Englishmen could effect; but rather\r\nthe high hopes thus inspired for the future progress of this fine\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\nNo such feeling was inspired by the conditions surrounding the Roman\r\nCatholic missionaries whom he met from time to time. In an earlier part\r\nof the \"Journal\" he records an evening spent with one living in a lonely\r\nplace in South America who, \"coming from Santiago, had contrived to\r\nsurround himself with some few comforts. Being a man of some little\r\neducation, he bitterly complained of the total want of society. With no\r\nparticular zeal for religion, no business or pursuit, how completely\r\nmust this man's life be wasted.\"\r\n\r\nIn complete opposition to these views, passages occur in the following\r\nletters which show that Wallace thought more highly of the Roman\r\nCatholic than of the Protestant missionaries. In one place, speaking of\r\nthe former, he says: \"Most are Frenchmen ... well-educated men who give\r\nup their lives for the good of the people they live among, I think\r\nCatholics and Protestants are equally wrong, but as missionaries I think\r\nCatholics are the best, and I would gladly see none others rather than\r\nhave, as in New Zealand, sects of native Dissenters more rancorous\r\nagainst each other than in England. The unity of the Catholics is their\r\nstrength, and an unmarried clergy can do as missionaries what married\r\nmen never can undertake.\"\r\n\r\nAs a sidelight on these contradictory estimates of the same work, it\r\nshould be borne in mind that Darwin had but recently given up the idea\r\nof becoming a clergyman, and doubtless retained some of the instinctive\r\nregard for sincere Christian Protestantism (whether represented by the\r\nChurch of England or by Nonconformists), while Wallace had long since\r\nrelinquished all doctrinal ideas on religion and all belief in the\r\nbeneficial effect produced by forms of worship on the individual.\r\n\r\nAmong the regions Wallace visited was Sarawak. Of one of his sojourns\r\nhere some interesting reminiscences have been sent to me by Mr. L.V.\r\nHelmes. He says:\r\n\r\n    It was in 1854 that Wallace came to Sarawak. I was there then,\r\n    sent by a private firm, which later became the Borneo Company, to\r\n    open up, by mining, manufacture and trade, the resources of the\r\n    country, and amongst these enterprises was coal-mining on the\r\n    west. Wallace came in search of new specimens of animal and\r\n    especially insect life. The clearing of ancient forests at these\r\n    mines offered a naturalist great opportunities, and I gave Wallace\r\n    an introduction to our engineer in charge there. His collections\r\n    of beetles and butterflies there were phenomenal; but the district\r\n    was also the special home of the great ape, the orang-utan, or\r\n    meias, as the natives called them, of which he obtained so many\r\n    valuable specimens. Many notes must at that time have passed\r\n    between us, for I took much interest in his work. We had put up a\r\n    temporary hut for him at the mines, and on my occasional visits\r\n    there I saw him and his young assistant, Charles Allen, at work,\r\n    admired his beautiful collections, and gave my help in forwarding\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    But it was mainly in social intercourse that we met, when Wallace,\r\n    in intervals of his labours, came to Ku-ching, and was the Rajah's\r\n    guest. Then occurred those interesting discussions at social\r\n    gatherings to which he refers in a letter to me in 1909, when he\r\n    wrote: \"I was pleased to receive your letter, with reminiscences\r\n    of old times. I often recall those pleasant evenings with Rajah\r\n    Brooke and our little circle, but since the old Rajah's death I\r\n    have not met any of the party.\"\r\n\r\n    Wallace was in Sarawak at the happy period in the country's\r\n    history. It was beginning to emerge from barbarism. The Borneo\r\n    Company was just formed, and the seed of the country's future\r\n    prosperity was sown. Wallace, therefore, found us all sanguine and\r\n    cheerful; yet we were on the brink of a disaster which brought\r\n    many sorrows in its train. But the misfortunes of the Chinese\r\n    revolt had not yet cast their shadows before them. The Rajah's\r\n    white guests round his hospitable table; the Malay chiefs and\r\n    office-holders, who made evening calls from curiosity or to pay\r\n    their respects; Dyaks squatting in dusky groups in corners of the\r\n    hall, with petitions to make or advice to seek from their white\r\n    ruler--such would be the gathering of which Wallace would form a\r\n    part. No suspicion or foreboding would trouble the company; yet\r\n    within a few months that hall would be given to the flames of an\r\n    enemy's torch, and the Rajah himself and many of those who formed\r\n    that company would be fugitives in the jungle....\r\n\r\n    The Malay Archipelago, in the unregenerated days when Wallace\r\n    roamed the forests, and sailed the Straits in native boats and\r\n    canoes, was full of danger to wanderers of the white race. Anarchy\r\n    prevailed in many parts; usurping nobles enslaved the people in\r\n    their houses; and piratical fleets scoured the sea, capturing and\r\n    enslaving yearly thousands of peaceful traders, women and\r\n    children. The writer was himself in 1862 besieged in a Bornean\r\n    river by a pirate fleet, which was eventually destroyed by a\r\n    Sarawak Government steamer with the following result of the fight:\r\n    190 pirates and 140 captives were killed or drowned, and 250 of\r\n    the latter were liberated and sent to their homes; showing how\r\n    formidable these pirates were. But Wallace, absorbed in his\r\n    scientific pursuits, minded not these dangers, nor the hardships\r\n    of any kind which a roving life in untrodden jungles and feverish\r\n    swamps brings.\r\n\r\n    When Wallace left Sarawak after his fifteen months' residence in\r\n    the country, he left his young assistant, Charles Allen, there. He\r\n    entered my service, and remained some time after the formation of\r\n    the Borneo Company. Later, he again joined Wallace, and then went\r\n    to New Guinea, doing valuable collecting and exploring work. He\r\n    finally settled in Singapore, where I met him in 1899. He had\r\n    married and was doing well; but died not long after my interview\r\n    with him. He had come to the East with Wallace as a lad of 16, and\r\n    had been his faithful companion and assistant during years of\r\n    arduous work.--L.V.H.\r\n\r\nThe eight years spent by Wallace in this almost unknown part of the\r\nworld were times of strenuous mental and physical exertion, resulting in\r\nthe gathering together of an enormous amount of matter for future\r\nscientific investigation, but counterbalanced unfortunately by more or\r\nless continuous ill-health--which at times made the effort of clear\r\nreasoning and close application to scientific pursuits extremely\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nAn indication of the unwearying application with which he went about his\r\ntask is seen in the fact that during this period he collected 125,660\r\nspecimens of natural history, travelled about 14,000 miles within the\r\nArchipelago, and made sixty or seventy journeys, \"each involving some\r\npreparation and loss of time,\" so that \"not more than six years were\r\nreally occupied in collecting.\"\r\n\r\nA faint idea of this long and solitary sojourn in lonely places is\r\ngiven in a letter to his old friend Bates, dated December 24th, 1860, in\r\nwhich he says: \"Many thanks for your long and interesting letter. I have\r\nmyself suffered much in the same way as you describe, and I think more\r\nseverely. The kind of _tædium vitæ_ you mention I also occasionally\r\nexperience here. I impute it to a too monotonous existence.\" And again\r\nwhen he begs his friend to write, as he is \"half froze for news.\"\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Wallace, at no time during these wanderings, had any\r\nescort or protection, having to rely entirely upon his own tact and\r\npatience, combined with firmness, in his dealings with the natives. On\r\none occasion he was taken ill, and had to remain six weeks with none but\r\nnative Papuans around him, and he became so attached to them that when\r\nsaying good-bye it was with the full intention of returning amongst them\r\nat a later period. In another place he speaks of sleeping under cover of\r\nan open palm-leaf hut as calmly as under the protection of the\r\nMetropolitan Police!\r\n\r\nUp to that time, also, he was the only Englishman who had actually seen\r\nthe beautiful \"birds of paradise in their native forests,\" this success\r\nbeing achieved after \"five voyages to different parts of the district\r\nthey inhabit, each occupying in its preparation and execution the larger\r\npart of a year.\" And then only five species out of a possible fourteen\r\nwere procured. His enthusiasm as a naturalist and collector knew no\r\nbounds, butterflies especially calling into play all his feelings of joy\r\nand satisfaction. Describing his first sight of the _Ornithoptera\r\ncroesus_, he says that the blood rushed to his head and he felt much\r\nmore like fainting than he had done when in apprehension of immediate\r\ndeath; a similar sensation being experienced when he came across another\r\nlarge bird-winged butterfly, _Ornithoptera poseidon_.\r\n\r\n\"It is one thing,\" he says, \"to see such beauty in a cabinet, and quite\r\nanother to feel it struggling between one's fingers, and to gaze upon\r\nits fresh and living beauty, a bright-green gem shining out amid the\r\nsilent gloom of a dark and tangled forest. The village of Dobbo held\r\nthat evening at least one contented man.\"\r\n\r\nThese thrills of joy may be considered as some compensation for such\r\nexperiences as those contained in his graphic account of a single\r\njourney in a \"prau,\" or native boat. \"My first crew,\" he wrote, \"ran\r\naway; two men were lost for a month on a desert island; we were ten\r\ntimes aground on coral reefs; we lost four anchors; our sails were\r\ndevoured by rats; the small boat was lost astern; we were thirty-eight\r\ndays on the voyage home which should have taken twelve; we were many\r\ntimes short of food and water; we had no compass-lamp owing to there not\r\nbeing a drop of oil in Waigiou when we left; and to crown it all, during\r\nthe whole of our voyage, occupying in all seventy-eight days (all in\r\nwhat was supposed to be the favourable season), we had not one single\r\nday of fair wind.\"\r\n\r\nThe scientific discoveries arising out of these eight years of laborious\r\nwork and physical hardship were first--with the exception of the\r\nmemorable Essay on Natural Selection--included in his books on the Malay\r\nArchipelago, the Geographical Distribution of Animals, Island Life, and\r\nAustralasia, besides a number of papers contributed to various\r\nscientific journals.\r\n\r\nA bare catalogue of the places visited and explored includes Sumatra,\r\nJava, Borneo, Celebes, the Moluccas, Timor, New Guinea, the Aru and Ké\r\nIslands. Comparing this list with that given by Darwin at the close of\r\nthe \"Journal,\" we find that though in some respects the ground covered\r\nby the two men was similar, it never actually overlapped. The countries\r\nand islands visited by the _Beagle_ came in the following order: Cape de\r\nVerde Islands, St. Paul's Rocks, Fernando Noronha, South America\r\n(including the Galapagos Archipelago, the Falkland Isles, and Tierra del\r\nFuego), Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia, Tasmania, Keeling Island,\r\nMaldive coral atolls, Mauritius, St. Helena, Ascension. Brazil was\r\nrevisited for a short time, and the _Beagle_ touched at the Cape de\r\nVerde Islands and the Azores on the homeward voyage.\r\n\r\nThe very nature of this voyage did not permit Darwin to give unlimited\r\ntime to the study of any particular spot or locality; but his accurate\r\nobservation of every detail, together with his carefully kept journal,\r\nafforded ample scope and foundation for future contemplation. To\r\nWallace, the outstanding result may be summed up in the fact that he\r\ndiscovered that the Malay Archipelago is divided into a western group of\r\nislands, which in their zoological affinities are Asiatic, and an\r\neastern, which are Australian. The Oriental Borneo and Bali are\r\nrespectively divided from the Australian Celebes and Lombok by a narrow\r\nbelt of sea known as \"Wallace's line,\" on the opposite side of which the\r\nindigenous mammalia are as widely divergent as in any two parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTo both men Darwin's estimate of the influence of travel may aptly apply\r\nin the sense that from a geographical point of view \"the map of the\r\nworld ceases to be a blank ... each part assumes its proper dimensions,\"\r\ncontinents are no longer considered islands, nor islands as mere specks.\r\n\r\nWallace's homeward journey was not so eventful as the previous one had\r\nbeen, except for the unsuccessful efforts to bring back several species\r\nof live birds, which, with the exception of his birds of paradise, died\r\non the way. On reaching London in the spring of 1862, he again made his\r\nhome with his married sister, Mrs. Sims (who was living in Westbourne\r\nGrove). In a large empty room at the top of the house he found himself\r\nsurrounded with packing-cases which he had not seen for five or six\r\nyears, and which, together with his recent collections, absorbed his\r\ntime and interest for the first few weeks. Later, he settled down to his\r\nliterary work, and, with the exception of one or two visits to the\r\nContinent and America, spent the remainder of his life in England--a\r\nlife full of activity, the results of which still permeate scientific\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I (_Continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Early Letters\r\n\r\n[1854--62]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the few letters which have been preserved relating to this period, a\r\nnumber have already been published in \"My Life,\" and need not be\r\nreprinted here. But in some cases portions of these letters have been\r\ngiven because they bring out aspects of Wallace's character which are\r\nnot revealed elsewhere. The various omissions which have been made in\r\nother letters refer either to unimportant personal matters or to\r\ntechnical scientific details. The first of the letters was written\r\nduring Wallace's voyage to the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO G. SILK\r\n\r\n\r\n_Steamer \"Bengal,\" Red Sea. March 26, [1854]._\r\n\r\nMy dear George,-- ... Of all the eventful days of my life my first in\r\nAlexandria was the most striking. Imagine my feelings when, coming out\r\nof the hotel (whither I had been conveyed in an omnibus) for the purpose\r\nof taking a quiet stroll through the city, I found myself in the midst\r\nof a vast crowd of donkeys and their drivers, all thoroughly determined\r\nto appropriate my person to their own use and interest, without in the\r\nleast consulting my inclinations. In vain with rapid strides and waving\r\narms I endeavoured to clear a way and move forward; arms and legs were\r\nseized upon, and even the Christian coat-tails were not sacred from the\r\nprofane Mahometans. One would hold together two donkeys by their tails\r\nwhile I was struggling between them, and another, forcing together their\r\nheads, would thus hope to compel me to mount upon one or both of them;\r\nand one fellow more impudent than the rest I laid flat upon the ground,\r\nand sending the donkey staggering after him, I escaped a moment midst\r\nhideous yells and most unearthly cries. I now beckoned to a fellow more\r\nsensible-looking than the rest, and told him that I wished to walk and\r\nwould take him for a guide, and hoped now to be at rest; but vain\r\nthought! I was in the hands of the Philistines, and getting us up\r\nagainst a wall, they formed an impenetrable phalanx of men and brutes\r\nthoroughly determined that I should only get away from the spot on the\r\nlegs of a donkey. Bethinking myself now that donkey-riding was a\r\nnational institution, and seeing a fat Yankee (very like my Paris\r\nfriend) mounted, being like myself hopeless of any other means of\r\nescape, I seized upon a bridle in hopes that I should then be left in\r\npeace. But this was the signal for a more furious onset, for, seeing\r\nthat I would at length ride, each one was determined that he alone\r\nshould profit by the transaction, and a dozen animals were forced\r\nsuddenly upon me and a dozen hands tried to lift me upon their\r\nrespective beasts. But now my patience was exhausted, so, keeping firm\r\nhold of the bridle I had first taken with one hand, I hit right and left\r\nwith the other, and calling upon my guide to do the same, we succeeded\r\nin clearing a little space around us. Now then behold your friend\r\nmounted upon a jackass in the streets of Alexandria, a boy behind\r\nholding by his tail and whipping him up, Charles (who had been lost\r\nsight of in the crowd) upon another, and my guide upon a third, and off\r\nwe go among a crowd of Jews and Greeks, Turks and Arabs, and veiled\r\nwomen and yelling donkey-boys to see the city. We saw the bazaars and\r\nthe slave market, where I was again nearly pulled to pieces for\r\n\"backsheesh\" (money), the mosques with their elegant minarets, and then\r\nthe Pasha's new palace, the interior of which is most gorgeous.\r\n\r\nWe have seen lots of Turkish soldiers walking in comfortable\r\nirregularity; and, after feeling ourselves to be dreadful guys for two\r\nhours, returned to the hotel whence we were to start for the canal\r\nboats. You may think this account is exaggerated, but it is not; the\r\npertinacity, vigour and screams of the Alexandrian donkey-drivers no\r\ndescription can do justice to....--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singapore, April 30, 1854_.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--We arrived here safe on the 20th of this month, having\r\nhad very fine weather all the voyage. On shore I was obliged to go to a\r\nhotel, which was very expensive, so I tried to get out into the country\r\nas soon as I could, which, however, I did not manage in less than a\r\nweek, when I at last got permission to stay with a French Roman Catholic\r\nmissionary who lives about eight miles out of the town and close to the\r\njungle. The greater part of the inhabitants of Singapore are Chinese,\r\nmany of whom are very rich, and all the villages about are almost\r\nentirely of Chinese, who cultivate pepper and gambir. Some of the\r\nEnglish merchants here have splendid country houses. I dined with one to\r\nwhom I brought an introduction. His house was most elegant, and full of\r\nmagnificent Chinese and Japanese furniture. We are now at the Mission of\r\nBukit Tima. The missionary speaks English, Malay and Chinese, as well as\r\nFrench, and is a very pleasant man. He has built a very pretty church\r\nhere, and has about 300 Chinese converts. Having only been here four\r\ndays, I cannot tell much about my collections yet. Insects, however,\r\nare plentiful....\r\n\r\nCharles gets on pretty well in health, and catches a few insects; but he\r\nis very untidy, as you may imagine by his clothes being all torn to\r\npieces by the time we arrived here. He will no doubt improve and will\r\nsoon be useful.\r\n\r\nMalay is the universal language, in which all business is carried on. It\r\nis easy, and I am beginning to pick up a little, but when we go to\r\nMalacca shall learn it most, as there they speak nothing else.\r\n\r\nI am very unfortunate with my watch. I dropped it on board and broke the\r\nbalance-spring, and have now sent it home to Mr. Matthews to repair, as\r\nI cannot trust anyone here to do it....\r\n\r\nLove to Fanny and Thomas,--I remain your affectionate son,\r\n\r\nALFRED B. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bukit Tama, Singapore. May 28, 1854._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--I send you a few lines through G. Silk as I thought you\r\nwould like to hear from me. I am very comfortable here living with a\r\nRoman Catholic missionary.... I send by this mail a small box of insects\r\nfor Mr. Stevens--I think a very valuable one--and I hope it will go\r\nsafely. I expected a letter from you by the last mail, but received only\r\ntwo _Athenoeums_ of March 18 and 25....\r\n\r\nThe forest here is very similar to that of South America. Palms are very\r\nnumerous, but they are generally small and horridly spiny. There are\r\nnone of the large and majestic species so abundant on the Amazon. I am\r\nso busy with insects now that I have no time for anything else, I send\r\nnow about a thousand beetles to Mr. Stevens, and I have as many other\r\ninsects still on hand which will form part of my next and principal\r\nconsignment. Singapore is very rich in beetles, and before I leave I\r\nthink I shall have a most beautiful collection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.R. WALLACE'S MOTHER]\r\n\r\nI will tell you how my day is now occupied. Get up at half-past five.\r\nBath and coffee. Sit down to arrange and put away my insects of the day\r\nbefore, and set them safe out to dry. Charles mending nets, filling\r\npincushions, and getting ready for the day. Breakfast at eight. Out to\r\nthe jungle at nine. We have to walk up a steep hill to get to it, and\r\nalways arrive dripping with perspiration. Then we wander about till two\r\nor three, generally returning with about 50 or 60 beetles, some very\r\nrare and beautiful. Bathe, change clothes, and sit down to kill and pin\r\ninsects. Charles ditto with flies, bugs and wasps; I do not trust him\r\nyet with beetles. Dinner at four. Then to work again till six. Coffee.\r\nRead. If very numerous, work at insects till eight or nine. Then to bed.\r\n\r\nAdieu, with love to all.--Your affectionate son,\r\n\r\nALFRED E. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the Jungle near Malacca. July, 1854._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--As this letter may be delayed getting to Singapore I\r\nwrite at once, having an opportunity of sending to Malacca to-morrow. We\r\nhave been here a week, living in a Chinese house or shed, which reminds\r\nme remarkably of my old Rio Negro habitation. I have now for the first\r\ntime brought my \"rede\" into use, and find it very comfortable.\r\n\r\nWe came from Singapore in a small schooner with about fifty Chinese,\r\nHindoos and Portuguese passengers, and were two days on the voyage,\r\nwith nothing but rice and curry to eat, not having made any provision,\r\nit being our first experience of these country vessels. Malacca is an\r\nold Dutch city, but the Portuguese have left the strongest mark of their\r\npossession in the common language of the place being still theirs. I\r\nhave now two Portuguese servants, a cook and a hunter, and find myself\r\nthus almost brought back again to Brazil by the similarity of language,\r\nthe people, and the jungle life. In Malacca we stayed only two days,\r\nbeing anxious to get into the country as soon as possible. I stayed with\r\na Roman Catholic missionary; there are several here, each devoted to a\r\nparticular part of the population, Portuguese, Chinese and wild Malays\r\nof the jungle. The gentleman we were with is building a large church, of\r\nwhich he is architect himself, and superintends the laying of every\r\nbrick and the cutting of every piece of timber. Money enough could not\r\nbe raised here, so he took a voyage _round the world!_ and in the United\r\nStates, California, and India got subscriptions sufficient to complete\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious and not very creditable thing that in the English\r\ncolonies of Singapore and Malacca there is not a single Protestant\r\nmissionary; while the conversion, education and physical and moral\r\nimprovement of the inhabitants (non-European) is entirely left to these\r\nFrench missionaries, who without the slightest assistance from our\r\nGovernment devote their lives to the Christianising and civilising of\r\nthe varied populations which we rule over.\r\n\r\nHere the birds are abundant and most beautiful, more so than on the\r\nAmazon, and I think I shall soon form a most beautiful collection. They\r\nare, however, almost all common, and so are of little value except that\r\nI hope they will be better specimens than usually come to England. My\r\nguns are both very good, but I find powder and shot in Singapore\r\ncheaper than in London, so I need not have troubled myself to take any.\r\nSo far both I and Charles have enjoyed excellent health. He can now\r\nshoot pretty well, and is so fond of it that I can hardly get him to do\r\nanything else. He will soon be very useful, if I can cure him of his\r\nincorrigible carelessness. At present I cannot trust him to do the\r\nsmallest thing without watching that he does it properly, so that I\r\nmight generally as well do it myself. I shall remain here probably two\r\nmonths, and then return to Singapore to prepare for a voyage to Cambodia\r\nor somewhere else, so do not be alarmed if you do not hear from me\r\nregularly. Love to all.--Your affectionate son,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singapore. September 30, 1854._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--I last wrote to you from Malacca in July. I have now\r\njust returned to Singapore after two months' hard work. At Malacca I had\r\na pretty strong touch of fever with the old Rio Negro symptoms, but the\r\nGovernment doctor made me take a great quantity of quinine every day for\r\na week together and so killed it, and in less than a fortnight I was\r\nquite well and off to the jungle again. I see now how to treat the\r\nfever, and shall commence at once when the symptoms again appear. I\r\nnever took half enough quinine in America to cure me. Malacca is a\r\npretty place, and I worked very hard. Insects are not very abundant\r\nthere, still by perseverance I got a good number and many rare ones. Of\r\nbirds, too, I made a good collection. I went to the celebrated Mount\r\nOphir and ascended to the top. The walk was terrible--thirty miles\r\nthrough jungle, a succession of mud holes. My boots did good service. We\r\nlived there a week at the foot of the mountain, in a little hut built\r\nby our men, and I got some fine new butterflies there and hundreds of\r\nother new and rare insects. We had only rice and a little fish and tea,\r\nbut came home quite well. The height of the mountain is about 4,000\r\nfeet.... Elephants and rhinoceroses, as well as tigers, are abundant\r\nthere, but we had our usual bad luck in not seeing any of them.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Malacca I found the accumulations of two or three posts,\r\na dozen letters and fifty newspapers....\r\n\r\nI am glad to be safe in Singapore with my collections, as from here they\r\ncan be insured. I have now a fortnight's work to arrange, examine, and\r\npack them, and then in four months hence there will be some work for Mr.\r\nStevens.\r\n\r\nSir James Brooke is here. I have called on him. He received me most\r\ncordially, and offered me every assistance at Sarawak. I shall go there\r\nnext, as the missionary does not go to Cambodia for some months.\r\nBesides, I shall have some pleasant society at Sarawak, and shall get on\r\nin Malay, which is very easy, but I have had no practice--though still I\r\ncan ask for most common things. My books and instruments arrived in\r\nbeautiful condition. They looked as if they had been packed up but a\r\nday. Not so the unfortunate eatables....--I remain your affectionate\r\nson,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO G. SILK\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singapore. October 15, 1854._\r\n\r\nDear G.,--To-morrow I sail for Sarawak. Sir J. Brooke has given me a\r\nletter to his nephew, Capt. Brooke, to make me at home till he arrives,\r\nwhich may be a month, perhaps. I look forward with much interest to see\r\nwhat he has done and how he governs. I look forward to spending a very\r\npleasant time at Sarawak....\r\n\r\nSir W. Hooker's remarks are encouraging, but I cannot afford to collect\r\nplants. I have to work for a living, and plants would not pay unless I\r\ncollect nothing else, which I cannot do, being too much interested in\r\nzoology. I should like a botanical companion like Mr. Spruce very much.\r\nWe are anxiously expecting accounts of the taking of Sebastopol.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to Latham for quoting me, and hope to see it soon.\r\nThat ought to make my name a little known. I have not your talent at\r\nmaking acquaintances, and find Singapore very dull. I have not found a\r\nsingle companion. I long for you to walk about with and observe the\r\nqueer things in the streets of Singapore. The Chinamen and their ways\r\nare inexhaustibly amusing. My revolver is too heavy for daily use. I\r\nwish I had had a small one.--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO AN UNKNOWN CORRESPONDENT[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Si Munjon Coal Works, Borneo. May, 1855._\r\n\r\nOne of the principal reasons which induced me to come here was that it\r\nis the country of those most strange and interesting animals, the\r\norang-utans, or \"mias\" of the Dyaks. In the Sarawak district, though\r\nscarce twenty miles distant, they are quite unknown, there being some\r\nboundary line in this short space which, obeying the inexplicable laws\r\nof distribution, they never pass. The Dyaks distinguish three different\r\nkinds, which are known in Europe by skulls or skeletons only, much\r\nconfusion still existing in their synonymy, and the external characters\r\nof the adult animals being almost or quite unknown. I have already been\r\nfortunate enough to shoot two young animals of two of the species,\r\nwhich were easily distinguishable from each other, and I hope by staying\r\nhere some time to get adult specimens of all the species, and also to\r\nobtain much valuable information as to their habits. The jungle here is\r\nexceedingly monotonous; palms are scarce and flowers almost wanting,\r\nexcept some species of dwarf gingerwort. It is high on the trees that\r\nflowers are alone to be found.... Oak trees are rather plentiful, as I\r\nhave already found three species with red, brown, and black acorns. This\r\nis confirmatory of Dr. Hooker's statement that, contrary to the\r\ngenerally received opinion, oaks are equally characteristic of a\r\ntropical as of a temperate climate. I must make an exception to the\r\nscarcity of flowers, however, tall slender trees occurring not\r\nunfrequently, whose stems are flower-bearing. One is a magnificent\r\nobject, 12 or 15 ft. of the stem being almost hidden by rich\r\norange-coloured flowers, which in the gloomy forest have, as I have\r\nbefore remarked of tropical insects under similar circumstances, an\r\nalmost magical effect of brilliancy. Not less beautiful is another tree\r\nsimilarly clothed with spikes of pink and white berries.\r\n\r\nThe only striking features of the animal world are the hornbills, which\r\nare very abundant and take the place of the toucans of Brazil, though I\r\nbelieve they have no real affinity with them; and the immense flights of\r\nfruit-eating bats which frequently pass over us. They extend as far as\r\nthe eye can reach, and continue passing for hours. By counting and\r\nestimation I calculated that at least 30,000 passed one evening while we\r\ncould see them, and they continued on some time after dark. The species\r\nis probably the _Pteropus edulis_; its expanded wings are near 5 ft.\r\nacross, and it flies with great ease and rapidity. Fruit seems so scarce\r\nin these jungles that it is a mystery where they find enough to supply\r\nsuch vast multitudes.\r\n\r\nOur mode of life here is very simple--rather too much so, as we have a\r\ncontinual struggle to get enough to eat. The Sarawak market is to a\r\ngreat extent supplied with rice, fowls, and sweet potatoes from this\r\nriver, yet I have been obliged to send to Sarawak to purchase these very\r\narticles. The reason is that the Dyaks are almost all in debt to the\r\nMalay traders, and will therefore not sell anything, fearful of not\r\nhaving sufficient to satisfy their creditors. They have now just got in\r\ntheir rice harvest, and though it is not a very abundant one there is no\r\nimmediate pressure of hunger to induce them to earn anything by hunting\r\nor snaring birds, etc. This also prevents them from being very\r\nindustrious in seeking for the \"mias,\" though I have offered a high\r\nprice for full-grown animals. The old men here relate with pride how\r\nmany heads they have taken in their youth, and though they all\r\nacknowledge the goodness of the present Rajah's government, yet they\r\nthink that if they could still take a few heads they would have better\r\nharvests. The more I see of uncivilised people, the better I think of\r\nhuman nature on the whole, and the essential differences between\r\nso-called civilised and savage man seem to disappear. Here are we, two\r\nEuropeans surrounded by a population of Chinese, Malays, and Dyaks. The\r\nChinese are generally considered, and with some truth, to be thieves,\r\nliars, and careless of human life, and these Chinese are coolies of the\r\nvery lowest and least educated class. The Malays are invariably\r\ncharacterised as treacherous and bloodthirsty, and the Dyaks have only\r\nrecently ceased to think head-taking an absolute necessity. We are two\r\ndays' journey from Sarawak, where, though the Government is European,\r\nyet it only exists by the consent and support of the native population.\r\nNow I can safely say that in any part of Europe, if the same facilities\r\nfor crime and disturbance existed, things would not go on so smoothly\r\nas they do here. We sleep with open doors and go about constantly\r\nunarmed; one or two petty robberies and a little private fighting have\r\ntaken place among the Chinese, but the great proportion of them are\r\nquiet, honest, decent sort of men. They did not at first like the\r\nstrictness and punctuality with which the English manager kept them to\r\ntheir work, and two or three ringleaders tried to get up a strike for\r\nshort hours and higher wages, but Mr. G.'s energy and decision soon\r\nstopped this by sending off the ringleaders at once, and summoning all\r\nthe Dyaks and Malays in the neighbourhood to his assistance in case of\r\nany resistance being attempted. It was very gratifying to see how\r\nrapidly they came up at his summons, and this display of power did much\r\ngood, for since then everything has gone on smoothly. Preparations are\r\nnow making for building a \"joss house,\" a sure sign that the Chinese\r\nhave settled to the work, and giving every promise of success in an\r\nundertaking which must have a vast influence on the progress of commerce\r\nand civilisation of Borneo and the surrounding countries. India,\r\nAustralia, and every country with which they have communication must\r\nalso be incalculably benefited by an abundant supply of good coal within\r\ntwo days' steam of Singapore. Let us wish success, then, to the Si\r\nMunjon Coal Works!--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS SISTER, MRS. SIMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sadong River Borneo]. June 25, 1855._\r\n\r\nMy dear Fanny,-- ... I am now obliged to keep fowls and pigs, or we\r\nshould get nothing to eat. I have three pigs now and a China boy to\r\nattend to them, who also assists in skinning \"orang-utans,\" which he and\r\nCharles are doing at this moment. I have also planted some onions and\r\npumpkins, which were above ground in three days and are growing\r\nvigorously. I have been practising salting pork, and find I can make\r\nexcellent pickled pork here, which I thought was impossible, as everyone\r\nI have seen try has failed. It is because they leave it to servants, who\r\nwill not take the necessary trouble. I do it myself. I shall therefore\r\nalways keep pigs in the future. I find there will not be time for\r\nanother box round the Cape, so must have a small parcel overland. I\r\nshould much like my _lasts_, but nothing else, unless some canvas shoes\r\nare made.\r\n\r\nIf the young man my mother and Mr. Stevens mentioned comes, he can bring\r\nthem. I shall write to Mr. Stevens about the terms on which I can take\r\nhim. I am, however, rather shy about it, having hitherto had no one to\r\nsuit me. As you seem to know him, I suppose he comes to see you\r\nsometimes. Let me know what you think of him. Do not tell me merely that\r\nhe is \"a very nice young man.\" Of course he is. So is Charles a very\r\nnice boy, but I could not be troubled with another like him for any\r\nconsideration whatever. I have written to Mr. Stevens to let me know his\r\ncharacter, as regards _neatness_ and _perseverance_ in doing anything he\r\nis set about. From you I should like to know whether he is quiet or\r\nboisterous, forward or shy, talkative or silent, sensible or frivolous,\r\ndelicate or strong. Ask him whether he can live on rice and salt fish\r\nfor a week on an occasion--whether he can do without wine or beer, and\r\nsometimes without tea, coffee or sugar--whether he can sleep on a\r\nboard--whether he likes the hottest weather in England--whether he is\r\ntoo delicate to skin a stinking animal--whether he can walk twenty miles\r\na day--whether he can work, for there is sometimes as hard work in\r\ncollecting as in anything. Can he draw (not copy)? Can he speak French?\r\nDoes he write a good hand? Can he make anything? Can he saw a piece of\r\nboard straight? (Charles cannot, and every bit of carpenter work I have\r\nto do myself.) Ask him to make you anything--a little card box, a\r\nwooden peg or bottle-stopper, and see if he makes them neat, straight\r\nand square. Charles never does anything the one or the other. Charles\r\nhas now been with me more than a year, and every day some such\r\nconversation as this ensues: \"Charles, look at these butterflies that\r\nyou set out yesterday.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Look at that one--is it set out\r\nevenly?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Put it right then, and all the others that want\r\nit.\" In five minutes he brings me the box to look at. \"Have you put them\r\nall right?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"There's one with the wings uneven, there's\r\nanother with the body on one side, then another with the pin crooked.\r\nPut them all right this time.\" It most frequently happens that they have\r\nto go back a third time. Then all is right. If he puts up a bird, the\r\nhead is on one side, there is a great lump of cotton on one side of the\r\nneck like a wen, the feet are twisted soles uppermost, or something\r\nelse. In everything it is the same, what ought to be straight is always\r\nput crooked. This after twelve months' constant practice and constant\r\nteaching! And not the slightest sign of improvement. I believe he never\r\nwill improve. Day after day I have to look over everything he does and\r\ntell him of the same faults. Another with a similar incapacity would\r\ndrive me mad. He never, too, by any chance, puts anything away after\r\nhim. When done with, everything is thrown on the floor. Every other day\r\nan hour is lost looking for knife, scissors, pliers, hammer, pins, or\r\nsomething he has mislaid. Yet out of doors he does very well--he\r\ncollects insects well, and if I could get a neat, orderly person in the\r\nhouse I would keep him almost entirely at out-of-door work and at\r\nskinning, which he does also well, but cannot put into shape....--Your\r\naffectionate brother,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sarawak. Christmas Day, 1855._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--You will see I am spending a second Christmas Day with\r\nthe Rajah.... I have lived a month with the Dyaks and have been a\r\njourney about sixty miles into the interior. I have been very much\r\npleased with the Dyaks. They are a very kind, simple and hospitable\r\npeople, and I do not wonder at the great interest Sir J. Brooke takes in\r\nthem. They are more communicative and lively than the American Indians,\r\nand it is therefore more agreeable to live with them. In moral character\r\nthey are far superior to either Malays or Chinese, for though\r\nhead-taking has been a custom among them it is only as a trophy of war.\r\nIn their own villages crimes are very rare. Ever since Sir J. has been\r\nhere, more than twelve years, in a large population there has been but\r\none case of murder in a Dyak tribe, and that one was committed by a\r\nstranger who had been adopted into the tribe. One wet day I got a piece\r\nof string to show them how to play \"scratch cradle,\" and was quite\r\nastonished to find that they knew it better than I did and could make\r\nall sorts of new figures I had never seen. They were also very clever\r\nwith tricks with string on their fingers, which seemed to be a favourite\r\namusement. Many of the distant tribes think the Rajah cannot be a man.\r\nThey ask all sorts of curious questions about him, whether he is not as\r\nold as the mountains, whether he cannot bring the dead to life, and I\r\nhave no doubt for many years after his death he will be looked upon as a\r\ndeity and expected to come back again. I have now seen a good deal of\r\nSir James, and the more I see of him the more I admire him. With the\r\nhighest talents for government he combines the greatest goodness of\r\nheart and gentleness of manner. At the same time he has such confidence\r\nand determination, that he has put down with the greatest ease some\r\nconspiracies of one or two Malay chiefs against him. It is a unique case\r\nin the history of the world, for a European gentleman to rule over two\r\nconflicting races of semi-savages with their own consent, without any\r\nmeans of coercion, and depending solely upon them for protection and\r\nsupport, and at the same time to introduce the benefits of civilisation\r\nand check all crime and semi-barbarous practices. Under his government,\r\n\"running amuck,\" so frequent in all other Malay countries, has never\r\ntaken place, and with a population of 30,000 Malays, all of whom carry\r\ntheir \"creese\" and revenge an insult by a stab, murders do not occur\r\nmore than once in five or six years.\r\n\r\nThe people are never taxed but with their own consent, and Sir J.'s\r\nprivate fortune has been spent in the government and improvement of the\r\ncountry; yet this is the man who has been accused of injuring other\r\nparties for his own private interests, and of wholesale murder and\r\nbutchery to secure his government!...--Your ever affectionate son,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS SISTER, MRS. SIMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singapore.. February 20, 1856._\r\n\r\nMy dear Fanny,-- ... I have now left Sarawak, where I began to feel\r\nquite at home, and may perhaps never return to it again; but I shall\r\nalways look back with pleasure to my residence there and to my\r\nacquaintance with Sir James Brooke, who is a gentleman and a nobleman in\r\nthe noblest sense of both words....\r\n\r\nCharles has left me. He has stayed with the Bishop of Sarawak, who wants\r\nteachers and is going to try to educate him for one. I offered to take\r\nhim on with me, paying him a fair price for all the insects, etc., he\r\ncollected, but he preferred to stay. I hardly know whether to be glad\r\nor sorry he has left. It saves me a great deal of trouble and annoyance,\r\nand I feel it quite a relief to be without him. On the other hand, it is\r\na considerable loss for me, as he had just begun to be valuable in\r\ncollecting. I must now try and teach a China boy to collect and pin\r\ninsects. My collections in Borneo have been very good, but some of them\r\nwill, I fear, be injured by the long voyages of the ships. I have\r\ncollected upwards of 25,000 insects, besides birds, shells, quadrupeds,\r\nand plants. The day I arrived here a vessel sailed for Macassar, and I\r\nfear I shall not have another chance for two months unless I go a\r\nroundabout way, and perhaps not then, so I have hardly made up my mind\r\nwhat to do,--Your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW, THOMAS SIMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singapore. [Probably about March, 1856.]_\r\n\r\nDear Thomas,-- ... You and Fanny talk of my coming back for a trifling\r\nsore as if I was within an omnibus ride of Conduit St. I am now\r\nperfectly well, and only waiting to go eastward. The far east is to me\r\nwhat the far west is to the Americans. They both meet in California,\r\nwhere I hope to arrive some day. I quite enjoy being a few days at\r\nSingapore now. The scene is at once so familiar and strange. The\r\nhalf-naked Chinese coolies, the neat shopkeepers, the clean, fat, old,\r\nlong-tailed merchants, all as busy and full of business as any\r\nLondoners. Then the handsome Klings, who always ask double what they\r\ntake, and with whom it is most amusing to bargain. The crowd of boatmen\r\nat the ferry, a dozer begging and disputing for a farthing fare, the\r\nAmericans, the Malays, and the Portuguese make up a scene doubly\r\ninteresting to me now that I know something about them and can talk to\r\nthem in the general language of the place. The streets of Singapore on a\r\nfine day are as crowded and busy as Tottenham Court Road, and from the\r\nvariety of nations and occupations far more interesting. I am more\r\nconvinced than ever that no one can appreciate a new country in a short\r\nvisit. After two years in the country I only now begin to understand\r\nSingapore and to marvel at the life and bustle, the varied occupations,\r\nand strange population, on a spot which so short a time ago was an\r\nuninhabited jungle....--Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS SISTER, MRS. SIMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singapore. April 21, 1856._\r\n\r\nMy dear Fanny,--I believe I wrote to you last mail, and have now little\r\nto say except that I am still a prisoner in Singapore and unable to get\r\naway to my land of promise, Macassar, with whose celebrated oil you are\r\ndoubtless acquainted. I have been spending three weeks with my old\r\nfriend the French missionary, going daily into the jungle, and fasting\r\non Fridays on omelet and vegetables, a most wholesome custom which I\r\nthink the Protestants were wrong to leave off. I have been reading Huc's\r\ntravels in China in French, and talking with a French missionary just\r\narrived from Tonquin. I have thus obtained a great deal of information\r\nabout these countries and about the extent of the Catholic missions in\r\nthem, which is astonishing. How is it that they do their work so much\r\nmore thoroughly than the Protestant missionaries? In Cochin China,\r\nTonquin, and China, where all Christian missionaries are obliged to live\r\nin secret and are subject to persecution, expulsion, and often death,\r\nyet every province, even those farthest in the interior of China, have\r\ntheir regular establishment of missionaries constantly kept up by fresh\r\nsupplies who are taught the languages of the countries they are going to\r\nat Penang or Singapore. In China there are near a million Catholics, in\r\nTonquin and Cochin China more than half a million! One secret of their\r\nsuccess is the cheapness of their establishments. A missionary is\r\nallowed about £30 a year, on which he lives, in whatever country he may\r\nbe. This has two good effects. A large number of missionaries can be\r\nemployed with limited funds, and the people of the countries in which\r\nthey reside, seeing they live in poverty and with none of the luxuries\r\nof life, are convinced they are sincere. Most are Frenchmen, and those I\r\nhave seen or heard of are well-educated men, who give up their lives to\r\nthe good of the people they live among. No wonder they make converts,\r\namong the lower orders principally. For it must be a great comfort to\r\nthese poor people to have a man among them to whom they can go in any\r\ntrouble or distress, whose sole object is to comfort and advise them,\r\nwho visits them in sickness, who relieves them in want, and whom they\r\nsee living in daily danger of persecution and death only for their\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nYou will think they have converted me, but in point of doctrine I think\r\nCatholics and Protestants are equally wrong. As missionaries I think\r\nCatholics are best, and I would gladly see none others, rather than\r\nhave, as in New Zealand, sects of native Dissenters more rancorous\r\nagainst each other than in England. The unity of the Catholics is their\r\nstrength, and an unmarried clergy can do as missionaries what married\r\nmen can never undertake. I have written on this subject because I have\r\nnothing else to write about. Love to Thomas and Edward.--Believe me,\r\ndear Fanny, your ever affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS SISTER, MRS. SIMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Macassar. December 10, 1856._\r\n\r\nMy dear Fanny,--I have received yours of September, and my mother's of\r\nOctober, and as I am now going out of reach of letters for six months I\r\nmust send you a few lines to let you know that I am well and in good\r\nspirits, though rather disappointed with the celebrated Macassar.... For\r\nthe last fortnight, since I came in from the country, I have been living\r\nhere rather luxuriously, getting good rich cow's milk to my tea and\r\ncoffee, very good bread and excellent Dutch butter (3s. a lb.). The\r\nbread here is raised with toddy just as it is fermenting, and it imparts\r\na peculiar sweet taste to the bread which is very nice. At last, too,\r\nthere is some fruit here. The mangoes have just come in, and they are\r\ncertainly magnificent. The flavour is something between a peach and a\r\nmelon, with the slightest possible flavour of turpentine, and very\r\njuicy. They say they are unwholesome, and it is a good thing for me I am\r\ngoing away now. When I come back there will be not one to be had....--I\r\nremain, dear Fanny, your ever affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nA.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH.W. BATES TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tunantins, Upper Amazon. November 19, 1856._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,-- ... I received about six months ago a copy of your paper\r\nin the _Annals_ on \"The Laws which have Governed the Introduction of New\r\nSpecies.\" I was startled at first to see you already ripe for the\r\nenunciation of the theory. You can imagine with what interest I read and\r\nstudied it, and I must say that it is perfectly well done. The idea is\r\nlike truth itself, so simple and obvious that those who read and\r\nunderstand it will be struck by its simplicity; and yet it is perfectly\r\noriginal. The reasoning is close and clear, and although so brief an\r\nessay, it is quite complete, embraces the whole difficulty, and\r\nanticipates and annihilates all objections.\r\n\r\nFew men will be in a condition to comprehend and appreciate the paper,\r\nbut it will infallibly create for you a high and sound reputation. The\r\ntheory I quite assent to, and, you know, was conceived by me also, but I\r\nprofess that I could not have propounded it with so much force and\r\ncompleteness.\r\n\r\nMany details I could supply, in fact a great deal remains to be done to\r\nillustrate and confirm the theory: a new method of investigating and\r\npropounding zoology and botany inductively is necessitated, and new\r\nlibraries will have to be written; in part of this task I hope to be a\r\nlabourer for many happy and profitable years. What a noble subject would\r\nbe that of a monograph of a group of beings peculiar to one region but\r\noffering different species in each province of it--tracing the laws\r\nwhich connect together the modifications of forms and colour with the\r\n_local_ circumstances of a province or station--tracing as far as\r\npossible the actual _affiliation_ of the species.\r\n\r\nTwo of such groups occur to me at once, in entomology, in Heliconiidæ\r\nand Erotylidæ of South America; the latter I think more interesting than\r\nthe former for one reason--the species are more local, having feebler\r\nmeans of locomotion than the Heliconiidæ....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nHENRY WALTER BATES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO H.W. BATES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amboyna. January 4, 1858._\r\n\r\nMy dear Bates,--My delay of six months in answering your very\r\ninteresting and most acceptable letter dated an ideal absurdity put\r\nforth when such a simple hypothesis will explain _all the facts_.\r\n\r\nI have been much gratified by a letter from Darwin, in which he says\r\nthat he agrees with \"almost every word\" of my paper. He is now preparing\r\nfor publication his great work on species and varieties, for which he\r\nhas been collecting information twenty years. He may save me the trouble\r\nof writing the second part of my hypothesis by proving that there is no\r\ndifference in nature between the origin of species and varieties, or he\r\nmay give me trouble by arriving at another conclusion, but at all events\r\nhis facts will be given for me to work upon. Your collections and my own\r\nwill furnish most valuable material to illustrate and prove the\r\nuniversal applicability of the hypothesis. The connection between the\r\nsuccession of affinities and the geographical distribution of a group,\r\nworked out species by species, has never yet been shown as we shall be\r\nable to show it. In this Archipelago there are two distinct faunas\r\nrigidly circumscribed, which differ as much as those of South America\r\nand Africa, and more than those of Europe and North America: yet there\r\nis nothing on the map or on the face of the islands to mark their\r\nlimits. The boundary line often passes between islands closer than\r\nothers in the same group. I believe the western part to be a separated\r\nportion of continental Asia, the eastern the fragmentary prolongation of\r\na former Pacific continent. In mammalia and birds the distinction is\r\nmarked by genera, families, and even orders confined to one region; in\r\n_insects_ by a number of genera and little groups of peculiar species,\r\nthe _families_ of insects having generally a universal distribution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ternate, January 25, 1858._\r\n\r\nI have not done much here yet, having been much occupied in getting a\r\nhouse repaired and put in order. This island is a volcano with a sloping\r\nspur on which the town is situated. About ten miles to the east is the\r\ncoast of the large Island of Gilolo, perhaps the most perfect\r\nentomological _terra incognita_ now to be found. I am not aware that a\r\nsingle insect has ever been collected there, and cannot find it given as\r\nthe locality of any insects in my catalogues or descriptions. In about a\r\nweek I go for a month collecting there, and then return to prepare for a\r\nvoyage to New Guinea. I think I shall stay in this place two or three\r\nyears, as it is the centre of a most interesting and almost unknown\r\nregion. Every house here was destroyed in 1840 by an earthquake during\r\nan eruption of the volcano....\r\n\r\nWhat great political events have passed since we left England together!\r\nAnd the most eventful for England, and perhaps the most glorious, is the\r\npresent mutiny in India, which has proved British courage and pluck as\r\nmuch as did the famed battles of Balaclava and Inker-man. I believe that\r\nboth India and England will gain in the end by the fearful ordeal. When\r\ndo you mean returning for good? If you go to the Andes you will, I\r\nthink, be disappointed, at least in the number of species, especially of\r\nColeoptera. My experience here is that the low grounds are much the most\r\nproductive, though the mountains generally produce a few striking and\r\nbrilliant species....--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO F. BATES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ternate. March 2, 1858._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Bates,--When I received your very acceptable letter (a month\r\nago) I had just written one to your brother, which I thought I could not\r\ndo better than send to you to forward to him, as I shall thereby be able\r\nto confine myself solely to the group you are studying and to other\r\nmatters touched upon in your letter. I had heard from Mr. Stevens some\r\ntime ago that you had begun collecting exotic Geodephaga, but were\r\nconfining yourself to one or two illustrations of each genus. I was\r\nsure, however, that you would soon find this unsatisfactory. Nature must\r\nbe studied in detail, and it is the wonderful variety of the species of\r\na group, their complicated relations and their endless modification of\r\nform, size and colours, which constitute the pre-eminent charm of the\r\nentomologist's study. It is with the greatest satisfaction, too, I hail\r\nyour accession to the very limited number of collectors and students of\r\nexotic insects, and sincerely hope you may be sufficiently favoured by\r\nfortune to enable you to form an extensive collection and to devote the\r\nnecessary time to its study and ultimately to the preparation of a\r\ncomplete and useful work. Though I cannot but be pleased that you are\r\nable to do so, I am certainly surprised to find that you indulge in the\r\nexpensive luxury of from three to seven specimens of a species. I should\r\nhave thought that in such a very extensive group you would have found\r\none or, at most, a pair quite sufficient. I fancy very few collectors of\r\nexotic insects do more than this, except where they can obtain\r\nadditional specimens by gift or by exchange. Your remarks on my\r\ncollections are very interesting to me, especially as I have kept\r\ndescriptions with many outline figures of my Malacca and Sarawak\r\nGeodephaga, so that with one or two exceptions I can recognise and\r\nperfectly remember every species you mention....\r\n\r\nNow with regard to your request for notes of habits, etc. I shall be\r\nmost willing to comply with it to some extent, first informing you that\r\nI look forward to undertaking on my return to England a \"Coleoptera\r\nMalayana,\" to contain descriptions of the known species of the whole\r\nArchipelago, with an essay on their geographical distribution, and an\r\naccount of the habits of the genera and species from my own\r\nobservations. Of course, therefore, I do not wish any part of my notes\r\nto be published, as this will be a distinctive feature of the work, so\r\nlittle being known of the habits, stations and modes of collecting\r\nexotic Coleoptera, ...\r\n\r\nYou appear to consider the state of entomological literature flourishing\r\nand satisfactory: to _me_ it seems quite the contrary. The number of\r\nunfinished works and of others with false titles is disgraceful to\r\nscience....\r\n\r\nI think ... on the whole we may say that the Archipelago is _very rich_,\r\nand will bear a comparison even with the richest part of South America.\r\nIn the country between Ega and Peru there is work for fifty collectors\r\nfor fifty years. There are hundreds and thousands of Andean valleys\r\nevery one of which would bear exploring. Here it is the same with\r\nislands. I could spend twenty years here were life long enough, but feel\r\nI cannot stand it, away from home and books and collections and\r\ncomforts, more than four or five, and then I shall have work to do for\r\nthe rest of my life. What would be the use of accumulating materials\r\nwhich one could not have time to work up? I trust your brother may give\r\nus a grand and complete work on the Coleoptera of the Amazon Valley, if\r\nnot of all South America....--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 6, 1858._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,-- ... I have just returned from a short trip, and am now\r\nabout to start on a longer one, but to a place where there are some\r\nsoldiers, a doctor and engineer who speak English, so if it is good for\r\ncollecting I shall stay there some months. It is Batchian, an island on\r\nthe south-west side of Gilolo, about three or four days' sail from\r\nTernate. I am now quite recovered from my New Guinea voyage and am in\r\ngood health.\r\n\r\nI have received letters from Mr. Darwin and Dr. Hooker, two of the most\r\neminent naturalists in England, which has highly gratified me. I sent\r\nMr. Darwin an essay on a subject on which he is now writing a great\r\nwork. He showed it to Dr. Hooker and Sir C. Lyell, who thought so highly\r\nof it that they immediately read it before the Linnean Society. This\r\nassures me the acquaintance and assistance of these eminent men on my\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens also tells me of the great success of the Aru collection, of\r\nwhich £1,000 worth has actually been sold. This makes me hope I may soon\r\nrealise enough to live upon and carry out my long cherished plans of a\r\ncountry life in old England.\r\n\r\nIf I had sent the large and handsome shells from Aru, which are what you\r\nexpected to see, they would not have paid expenses, whereas the cigar\r\nbox of small ones has sold for £50. You must not think I shall always do\r\nso well as at Aru; perhaps never again, because no other collections\r\nwill have the novelty, all the neighbouring countries producing birds\r\nand insects very similar, and many even the very same. Still, if I have\r\nhealth I fear not to do very well. I feel little inclined now to go to\r\nCalifornia; as soon as I have finished my exploration of this region I\r\nshall be glad to return home as quickly and cheaply as possible. It\r\nwill certainly be by way of the Cape or by second class overland. May I\r\nmeet you, dear old Mother, and all my other relatives and friends, in\r\ngood health. Perhaps John and his trio will have had the start of me....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO H.W. BATES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ceram, November 25, 1859._\r\n\r\nDear Bates,--Allow me to congratulate you on your safe arrival home with\r\nall your treasures; a good fortune which I trust is this time[14]\r\nreserved for me. I hope you will write to me and tell me your projects.\r\nStevens hinted at your undertaking a \"Fauna of the Amazon Valley.\" It\r\nwould be a noble work, but one requiring years of labour, as of course\r\nyou would wish to incorporate all existing materials and would have to\r\nspend months in Berlin and Milan and Paris to study the collections of\r\nSpix, Natterer, Oscolati, Castituan and others, as well as most of the\r\nchief private collections of Europe. I hope you may undertake it and\r\nbring it to a glorious conclusion. I have long been contemplating such a\r\nwork for this Archipelago, but am convinced that the plan must be very\r\nlimited to be capable of completion....--I remain, dear Bates, yours\r\nvery sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO H.W. BATES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ternate. December 24, 1860._\r\n\r\nDear Bates,--Many thanks for your long and interesting letter. I have\r\nmyself suffered much in the same way as you describe, and I think more\r\nseverely. The kind of _tædium vitæ_ you mention I also occasionally\r\nexperience here. I impute it to a too monotonous existence.\r\n\r\nI know not how or to whom to express fully my admiration of Darwin's\r\nbook. To him it would seem flattery, to others self-praise; but I do\r\nhonestly believe that with however much patience I had worked up and\r\nexperimented on the subject, I could never have _approached_ the\r\ncompleteness of his book--its vast accumulation of evidence, its\r\noverwhelming argument, and its admirable tone and spirit. I really feel\r\nthankful that it has not been left to me to give the theory to the\r\npublic. Mr. Darwin has created a new science and a new philosophy, and I\r\nbelieve that never has such a complete illustration of a new branch of\r\nhuman knowledge been due to the labours and researches of a single man.\r\nNever have such vast masses of widely scattered and hitherto utterly\r\ndisconnected facts been combined into a system, and brought to bear upon\r\nthe establishment of such a grand and new and simple philosophy!...--In\r\nhaste, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW, THOMAS SIMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Delli, Timor. March 15, 1861_[15]\r\n\r\nMy dear Thomas,--I will now try and write you a few lines in reply to\r\nyour last three letters, which I have not before had time and\r\ninclination to do. First, about your _one-eyed_ and _two-eyed_ theory of\r\nart, etc. etc. I do not altogether agree with you. We do not see _all\r\nobjects_ wider with two eyes than with one. A spherical or curved object\r\nwe do see so, because our right and left eye each see a portion of the\r\nsurface not seen by the other, but for that very reason the portion seen\r\nperfectly with both eyes is _less_ than with one. Thus [_see_ diagram on\r\nnext page] we only see from A to A with both our eyes, the two side\r\nportions Ab Ab being seen with but one eye, and therefore (when we are\r\nusing both eyes) being seen obscurely. But if we look at a flat object,\r\nwhether square or oblique to the line of vision, we see it of exactly\r\nthe same size with two eyes as with one because the one eye can see no\r\npart of it that the other does not see also. But in painting I believe\r\nthat this difference of proportion, where it does exist, is far too\r\nsmall to be _given_ by any artist and also too small to affect the\r\npicture if given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAgain, I entirely deny that by _any means_ the exact effect of a\r\nlandscape with objects at various distances from the eye can be given on\r\na fiat surface; and moreover that the monocular clear outlined view is\r\nquite as true and good on the whole as the binocular hazy outlined view,\r\nand for this reason: we cannot and do not see clearly or look at two\r\nobjects at once, if at different distances from us. In a real view our\r\neyes are directed successively at every object, which we then see\r\nclearly and with distinct outlines, everything else--nearer and\r\nfarther--being indistinct; but being able to change the focal angle of\r\nour two eyes and their angle of direction with great rapidity, we are\r\nenabled to glance rapidly at each object in succession and thus obtain a\r\ngeneral and detailed view of the whole. A house, a tree, a spire, the\r\nleaves of a shrub in the foreground, are each seen (while we direct our\r\neyes to them) with perfect definition and sharpness of outline. Now a\r\nmonocular photo gives the clearness of outline and accuracy of\r\ndefinition, and thus represents every individual part of a landscape\r\njust as we see it when looking at that part. Now I maintain that this is\r\n_right_, because no painting can represent an object both distinct and\r\nindistinct. The only question is, Shall a painting show us objects as we\r\nsee them when looking at them, or as we see them when looking at\r\n_something else_ near them? The only approach painters can make to this\r\nvarying effect of binocular vision, and what they often do, is to give\r\nthe most important and main feature of their painting _distinct_ as we\r\nshould see it when looking at it in nature, while all around has a\r\nsubdued tone and haziness of outline like that produced by seeing the\r\nreal objects when our vision is not absolutely directed to them. But\r\nthen if, as in nature, when you turn your gaze to one of these objects\r\nin order to see it clearly, you cannot do so, this is a defect. Again, I\r\nbelieve that we actually see in a good photograph better than in nature,\r\nbecause the best camera lenses are more perfectly adjusted than our\r\neyes, and give objects at varying distances with better definition. Thus\r\nin a picture we see at the same time near and distinct objects easily\r\nand clearly, which in reality we cannot do. If we could do so, everyone\r\nmust acknowledge that our vision would be so much the more perfect and\r\nour appreciation of the beauties of nature more intense and complete;\r\nand in so far as a good landscape painting gives us this power it is\r\nbetter than nature itself; and I think this may account for that\r\nexcessive and entrancing beauty of a good landscape or of a good\r\npanorama. You will think these ideas horribly heterodox, but if we all\r\nthought alike there would be nothing to write about and nothing to\r\nlearn. I quite agree with you, however, as to artists using both eyes to\r\npaint and to see their paintings, but I think you quite mistake the\r\ntheory of looking through the \"catalogue\"; it is not because the picture\r\ncan be seen better with one eye, but because its effect can be better\r\nseen when all lateral objects are hidden--the catalogue does this. A\r\ndouble tube would be better, but that cannot be extemporised so easily.\r\nHave you ever tried a stereograph taken with the camera only the\r\ndistance apart of the eyes? That must give _nature_. When the angle is\r\ngreater the views in the stereoscope show us, not nature, but a perfect\r\nreduced model of nature seen nearer the eye.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that you should put Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites as\r\n_opposed_ and representing _binocular_ and _monocular_ painting when\r\nTurner himself praises up the Pre-Raphaelites and calls Holman Hunt the\r\ngreatest living painter!!...\r\n\r\nNow for Mr. Darwin's book. You quite misunderstand Mr. D.'s statement in\r\nthe preface and his sentiments. I have, of course, been in\r\ncorrespondence with him since I first sent him my little essay. His\r\nconduct has been most liberal and disinterested. I think anyone who\r\nreads the Linnean Society papers and his book will see it. I _do_ back\r\nhim up in his whole round of conclusions and look upon him as the\r\n_Newton of Natural History_.\r\n\r\nYou begin by criticising the _title_. Now, though I consider the title\r\nadmirable, I believe it is not Mr. Darwin's but the Publisher's, as you\r\nare no doubt aware that publishers _will_ have a taking title, and\r\nauthors must and do give way to them. Mr. D. gave me a different title\r\nbefore the book came out. Again, you misquote and misunderstand Huxley,\r\nwho is a complete convert. Prof. Asa Gray and Dr. Hooker, the two first\r\nbotanists of Europe and America, are converts. And Lyell, the first\r\ngeologist living, who has all his life written against such conclusions\r\nas Darwin arrives at, is a convert and is about to declare or already\r\nhas declared his conversion--a noble and almost unique example of a man\r\nyielding to conviction on a subject which he has taught as a master all\r\nhis life, and confessing that he has all his life been wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that you have not yet sufficiently read the book to enable\r\nyou to criticise it. It is a book in which every page and almost every\r\nline has a bearing on the main argument, and it is very difficult to\r\nbear in mind such a variety of facts, arguments and indications as are\r\nbrought forward. It was only on the _fifth_ perusal that I fully\r\nappreciated the whole strength of the work, and as I had been long\r\nbefore familiar with the same subjects I cannot but think that persons\r\nless familiar with them cannot have any clear idea of the accumulated\r\nargument by a single perusal.\r\n\r\nYour objections, so far as I can see anything definite in them, are so\r\nfully and clearly anticipated and answered in the book itself that it is\r\nperfectly useless my saying anything about them. It seems to me,\r\nhowever, as clear as daylight that the principle of Natural Selection\r\n_must_ act in nature. It is almost as necessary a truth as any of\r\nmathematics. Next, the effects produced by this action _cannot be\r\nlimited._ It cannot be shown that there _is_ any limit to them in\r\nnature. Again, the millions of facts in the numerical relations of\r\norganic beings, their geographical distribution, their relations of\r\naffinity, the modification of their parts and organs, the phenomena of\r\nintercrossing, embryology and morphology--all are in accordance with his\r\ntheory, and almost all are necessary results from it; while on the other\r\ntheory they are all isolated facts having no connection with each other\r\nand as utterly inexplicable and confusing as fossils are on the theory\r\nthat they are special creations and are not the remains of animals that\r\nhave once lived. It is the vast _chaos_ of facts, which are explicable\r\nand fall into beautiful order on the one theory, which are inexplicable\r\nand remain a chaos on the other, which I think must ultimately force\r\nDarwin's views on any and every reflecting mind. Isolated difficulties\r\nand objections are nothing against this vast cumulative argument. The\r\nhuman mind cannot go on for ever accumulating facts which remain\r\nunconnected and without any mutual bearing and bound together by no law.\r\nThe evidence for the production of the organic world by the simple laws\r\nof inheritance is exactly of the same nature as that for the production\r\nof the present surface of the earth--hills and valleys, plains, rocks,\r\nstrata, volcanoes, and all their fossil remains--by the slow and natural\r\naction of natural causes now in operation. The mind that will ultimately\r\nreject Darwin must (to be consistent) reject Lyell also. The same\r\narguments of apparent stability which are thought to disprove that\r\norganic species can change will also disprove any change in the\r\ninorganic world, and you must believe with your forefathers that each\r\nhill and each river, each inland lake and continent, were created as\r\nthey stand, with their various strata and their various fossils--all\r\nappearances and arguments to the contrary notwithstanding. I can only\r\nrecommend you to read again Darwin's account of the horse family and its\r\ncomparison with pigeons; and if that does not convince and stagger you,\r\nthen you are unconvertible. I do not expect Mr. Darwin's larger work\r\nwill add anything to the general strength of his argument. It will\r\nconsist chiefly of the details (often numerical) and experiments and\r\ncalculations of which he has already given the summaries and results. It\r\nwill therefore be more confusing and less interesting to the general\r\nreader. It will prove to scientific men the accuracy of his details, and\r\npoint out the sources of his information, but as not one in a thousand\r\nreaders will ever test these details and references the smaller work\r\nwill remain for general purposes the best....\r\n\r\nI see that the Great Exhibition for 1862 seems determined on. If so it\r\nwill be a great inducement to me to cut short the period of my\r\nbanishment and get home in time to see it. I assure you I now feel at\r\ntimes very great longings for the peace and quiet of home--very much\r\nweariness of this troublesome, wearisome, wandering life. I have lost\r\nsome of that elasticity and freshness which made the overcoming of\r\ndifficulties a pleasure, and the country and people are now too familiar\r\nto me to retain any of the charms of novelty which gild over so much\r\nthat is really monotonous and disagreeable. My health, too, gives way,\r\nand I cannot now put up so well with fatigue and privations as at first.\r\nAll these causes will induce me to come home as soon as possible, and I\r\nthink I may promise, if no accident happens, to come back to dear and\r\nbeautiful England in the summer of next year. C. Allen will stay a year\r\nlonger and complete the work which I shall not be able to do.\r\n\r\nI have been pretty comfortable here, having for two months had the\r\nsociety of Mr. Geach, a Cornish mining engineer who has been looking for\r\ncopper here. He is a very intelligent and pleasant fellow, but has now\r\nleft. Another Englishman, Capt. Hart, is a resident here. He has a\r\nlittle house on the foot of the hills two miles out of town; I have a\r\ncottage (which was Mr. Geach's) a quarter of a mile farther. He is what\r\nyou may call a _speculative_ man: he reads a good deal, knows a little\r\nand wants to know more, and is fond of speculating on the most abstruse\r\nand unattainable points of science and philosophy. You would be\r\nastonished at the number of men among the captains and traders of these\r\nparts who have more than an average amount of literary and scientific\r\ntaste; whereas among the naval and military officers and various\r\nGovernment officials very few have any such taste, but find their only\r\namusements in card-playing and dissipation. Some of the most\r\nintelligent and best informed Dutchmen I have met with are trading\r\ncaptains and merchants.\r\n\r\nThis country much resembles Australia in its physical features, and is\r\nvery barren compared with most of the other islands.... It is very\r\nrugged and mountainous, having no true forests, but a scanty vegetation\r\nof gum trees with a few thickets in moist places. It is consequently\r\nvery poor in insects, and in fact will hardly pay my expenses; but\r\nhaving once come here I may as well give it a fair trial. Birds are\r\ntolerably abundant, but with few exceptions very dull coloured. I really\r\nbelieve the whole series of birds of the tropical island of Timor are\r\nless beautiful and bright-coloured than those of Great Britain. In the\r\nmountains potatoes, cabbages and wheat are grown in abundance, and so we\r\nget excellent pure bread made by Chinamen in Delli. Fowls, sheep, pigs\r\nand onions are also always to be had, so that it is the easiest country\r\nto live in I have yet met with, as in most other places one is always\r\ndoubtful whether a dinner can be obtained. I have been a trip to the\r\nhills and stayed ten days in the clouds, but it was very wet, being the\r\nwrong season....\r\n\r\nHaving now paid you off my literary debts, I trust you will give me\r\ncredit again for some long letters on things in general. Address now to\r\ncare of Hamilton, Gray and Co., Singapore, and with love and\r\nremembrances to all friends, I remain, my dear Thomas, yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.-- ... Will you, next time you visit my mother, make me a little\r\nplan of her cottage, showing the rooms and their dimensions, so that I\r\nmay see if there will be room enough for me on my return? I shall want a\r\ngood-sized room for my collections, and when I can decide exactly on my\r\nreturn it would be as well to get a little larger house beforehand if\r\nnecessary. Please do not forget this.--Yours, A.R.W.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Write by next mail, as circumstances have occurred which make it\r\npossible I may return home this year.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You allude in your last letter to a subject I never touch upon\r\nbecause I know we cannot agree upon it. However, I will now say a few\r\nwords, that you may know my opinions, and if you wish to convert me to\r\nyour way of thinking, take more vigorous measures to effect it. You\r\nintimate that the happiness to be enjoyed in a future state will depend\r\nupon, and be a reward for, our belief in certain doctrines which you\r\nbelieve to constitute the essence of true religion. You must think,\r\ntherefore, that belief is _voluntary_ and also that it is _meritorious_.\r\nBut I think that a little consideration will show you that belief is\r\nquite independent of our will, and our common expressions show it. We\r\nsay, \"I wish I could believe him innocent, but the evidence is too clear\r\n\"; or, \"Whatever people may say, I can never believe he can do such a\r\nmean action.\" Now, suppose in any similar case the evidence on both\r\nsides leads you to a certain belief or disbelief, and then a reward is\r\noffered you for changing your opinion. Can you really change your\r\nopinion and belief, for the hope of reward or the fear of punishment?\r\nWill you not say, \"As the matter stands I can't change my belief. You\r\nmust give me proofs that I am wrong or show that the evidence I have\r\nheard is false, and then I may change my belief \"? It may be that you do\r\nget more and do change your belief. But this change is not voluntary on\r\nyour part. It depends upon the force of evidence upon your individual\r\nmind, and the evidence remaining the same and your mental faculties\r\nremaining unimpaired--you cannot believe otherwise any more than you can\r\nfly.\r\n\r\nBelief, then, is not voluntary. How, then, can it be meritorious? When\r\na jury try a case, all hear the same evidence, but nine say \"Guilty\" and\r\nthree \"Not guilty,\" according to the honest belief of each. Are either\r\nof these more worthy of reward on that account than the others?\r\nCertainly you will say No! But suppose beforehand they all know or\r\nsuspect that those who say \"Not guilty\" will be punished and the rest\r\nrewarded: what is likely to be the result? Why, perhaps six will say\r\n\"Guilty\" honestly believing it, and glad they can with a clear\r\nconscience escape punishment; three will say \"Not guilty\" boldly, and\r\nrather bear the punishment than be false or dishonest; the other three,\r\nfearful of being convinced against their will, will carefully stop their\r\nears while the witnesses for the defence are being examined, and delude\r\nthemselves with the idea they give an honest verdict because they have\r\nheard only one side of the evidence. If any out of the dozen deserve\r\npunishment, you will surely agree with me it is these. Belief or\r\ndisbelief is therefore not meritorious, and when founded on an unfair\r\nbalance of evidence is blameable.\r\n\r\nNow to apply the principles to my own case. In my early youth I heard,\r\nas ninety-nine-hundredths of the world do, only the evidence on one\r\nside, and became impressed with a veneration for religion which has left\r\nsome traces even to this day. I have since heard and read much on both\r\nsides, and pondered much upon the matter in all its bearings. I spent,\r\nas you know, a year and a half in a clergyman's family and heard almost\r\nevery Tuesday the very best, most earnest and most impressive preacher\r\nit has ever been my fortune to meet with, but it produced no effect\r\nwhatever on my mind. I have since wandered among men of many races and\r\nmany religions. I have studied man, and nature in all its aspects, and I\r\nhave sought after truth. In my solitude I have pondered much on the\r\nincomprehensible subjects of space, eternity, life and death. I think I\r\nhave fairly heard and fairly weighed the evidence on both sides, and I\r\nremain an _utter disbeliever_ in almost all that you consider the most\r\nsacred truths. I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated\r\naccusation that sceptics shut out evidence because they will not be\r\ngoverned by the morality of Christianity. You I know will not believe\r\nthat in my case, and _I_ know its falsehood as a general rule. I only\r\nask, Do you think I can change the self-formed convictions of\r\ntwenty-five years, and could you think such a change would have anything\r\nin it to merit _reward_ from _justice_? I am thankful I can see much to\r\nadmire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is\r\na necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature;\r\nwhether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state\r\nafter death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of\r\nnature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better\r\noff in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines\r\ninculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of\r\nblind faith than intelligent conviction.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\nThis for yourself; show the _letter only_ to my mother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sourabaya, Java. July 20, 1861._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,--I am, as you will see, now commencing my retreat\r\nwestwards, and have left the wild and savage Moluccas and New Guinea for\r\nJava, the Garden of the East, and probably without any exception the\r\nfinest island in the world. My plans are to visit the interior and\r\ncollect till November, and then work my way to Singapore so as to return\r\nhome and arrive in the spring. Travelling here will be a much pleasanter\r\nbusiness than in any other country I have visited, as there are good\r\nroads, regular posting stages, and regular inns or lodging-houses all\r\nover the interior, and I shall no more be obliged to carry about with me\r\nthat miscellaneous lot of household furniture--bed, blankets, pots,\r\nkettles and frying pan, plates, dishes and wash-basin, coffee-pots and\r\ncoffee, tea, sugar and butter, salt, pickles, rice, bread and wine,\r\npepper and curry powder, and half a hundred more odds and ends, the\r\nconstant looking after which, packing and repacking, calculating and\r\ncontriving, have been the standing plague of my life for the last seven\r\nyears. You will better understand this when I tell you that I have made\r\nin that time about eighty movements, averaging one a month, at every one\r\nof which all of these articles have had to be rearranged and repacked by\r\nmyself according to the length of the trip, besides a constant personal\r\nsupervision to prevent waste or destruction of stores in places where it\r\nis impossible to supply them.\r\n\r\nFanny wrote me last month to know about how I should like to live on my\r\nreturn. Of course, my dear mother, I should not think of living anywhere\r\nbut with you, after such a long absence, if you feel yourself equal to\r\nhousekeeping for us both; and I have always understood that your cottage\r\nwould be large enough. The accommodation I should require is, besides a\r\nsmall bedroom, one large room, or a small one if there is, besides, a\r\nkind of lumber room where I could keep my cases and do rough and dirty\r\nwork. I expect soon from Thomas a sketch-plan of your cottage, by which\r\nI can at once tell if it will do. If not, I must leave you and Fanny to\r\narrange as you like about a new residence. I should prefer being a\r\nlittle way out of town in a quiet neighbourhood and with a garden, but\r\nnear an omnibus route, and if necessary I could lodge at any time for a\r\nweek in London. This, I think, will be better and much cheaper than\r\nliving close to town, and rents anywhere in the West End are sure now to\r\nrise owing to the approaching Great Exhibition. I must of course study\r\neconomy, as the little money I have made will not be all got in for a\r\nyear or two after my return....\r\n\r\nYou must remember to write to me by the middle of November mail, as that\r\nis probably the last letter I can receive from you.\r\n\r\nI send the letter to Fanny, who will most likely call on you and talk\r\nover matters. I am a little confused arriving in a new place with a\r\ngreat deal to do and living in a noisy hotel, so different to my usual\r\nsolitary life, so that I cannot well collect my ideas to write any more,\r\nbut must remain, my dear mother, your ever affectionate son,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HIS SISTER, MRS. SIMS\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the Mountains of Java. October 10, 1861._\r\n\r\nMy dear Fanny,--I have just received your second letter in praise of\r\nyour new house. As I have said my say about it in my last, I shall now\r\nsend you a few lines on other subjects.\r\n\r\nI have been staying here a fortnight 4,000 feet above the sea in a fine\r\ncool climate, but it is unfortunately dreadfully wet and cloudy. I have\r\njust returned from a three days' excursion to one of the great Java\r\nvolcanoes 10,000 feet high. I slept two nights in a house 7,500 feet\r\nabove the sea. It was bitterly cold at night, as the hut was merely of\r\nplaited bamboo, like a sieve, so that the wind came in on all sides. I\r\nhad flannel jackets and blankets and still was cold, and my poor men,\r\nwith nothing but their usual thin cotton clothes, passed miserable\r\nnights lying on a mat on the ground round the fire which could only warm\r\none side at a time. The highest peak is an extinct volcano with the\r\ncrater nearly filled up, forming merely a saucer on the top, in which\r\nis a good house built by the Government for the old Dutch naturalists\r\nwho surveyed and explored the mountain. There are a lot of strawberries\r\nplanted there, which do very well, but there were not many ripe. The\r\ncommon weeds and plants of the top were very like English ones, such as\r\nbuttercups, sow-thistle, plantain, wormwood, chickweed, charlock, St.\r\nJohn's wort, violets and many others, all closely allied to our common\r\nplants of those names, but of distinct species. There was also a\r\nhoney-suckle, and a tall and very pretty kind of cowslip. None of these\r\nare found in the low tropical lands, and most of them only on the tops\r\nof these high mountains. Mr. Darwin supposed them to have come there\r\nduring a glacial or very cold period, when they could have spread over\r\nthe tropics and, as the heat increased, gradually rose up the mountains.\r\nThey were, as you may imagine, most interesting to me, and I am very\r\nglad that I have ascended _one_ lofty mountain in the tropics, though I\r\nhad miserable wet weather and had no view, owing to constant clouds and\r\nmist.\r\n\r\nI also visited a semi-active volcano close by continually sending out\r\nsteam with a noise like a blast-furnace--quite enough to give me a\r\nconception of all other descriptions of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe lower parts of the mountains of Java, from 3,000 to 6,000 feet, have\r\nthe most beautiful tropical vegetation I have ever seen. Abundance of\r\nsplendid tree ferns, some 50 ft. high, and some hundreds of varieties of\r\nother ferns, beautiful-leaved plants as begonias, melastomas, and many\r\nothers, and more flowers than are generally seen in the tropics. In\r\nfact, this region exhibits all the beauty the tropics can produce, but\r\nstill I consider and will always maintain that our own meadows and woods\r\nand mountains are more beautiful. Our own weeds and wayside flowers are\r\nfar prettier and more varied than those of the tropics. It is only the\r\ngreat leaves and the curious-looking plants, and the deep gloom of the\r\nforests and the mass of tangled vegetation that astonish and delight\r\nEuropeans, and it is certainly grand and interesting and in a certain\r\nsense beautiful, but not the calm, sweet, warm beauty of our own fields,\r\nand there is none of the brightness of our own flowers; a field of\r\nbuttercups, a hill of gorse or of heather, a bank of foxgloves and a\r\nhedge of wild roses and purple vetches surpass in _beauty_ anything I\r\nhave ever seen in the tropics. This is a favourite subject with me, but\r\nI cannot go into it now.\r\n\r\nSend the accompanying note to Mr. Stevens immediately. You will see what\r\nI say to him about my collections here. Java is the richest of all the\r\nislands in birds, but they are as well known as those of Europe, and it\r\nis almost impossible to get a new one. However, I am adding fine\r\nspecimens to my collection, which will be altogether the finest known of\r\nthe birds of the Archipelago, except perhaps that of the Leyden Museum,\r\nwho have had naturalists collecting for them in all the chief islands\r\nfor many years with unlimited means.\r\n\r\nGive my kind love to mother, to whom I will write next time.--Your\r\naffectionate brother,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO G. SILK[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singapore. January 20, 1862._\r\n\r\nMy dear George,-- ... On the question of marriage we probably differ\r\nmuch. I believe a good wife to be the greatest blessing a man can enjoy,\r\nand the only road to happiness, but the qualifications I should look for\r\nare probably not such as would satisfy you. My opinions have changed\r\nmuch on this point: I now look at intellectual companionship as quite a\r\nsecondary matter, and should my good stars ever send me an affectionate,\r\ngood-tempered and domestic wife, I shall care not one iota for\r\naccomplishments or even for education.\r\n\r\nI cannot write more now. I do not yet know how long I shall be here,\r\nperhaps a month. Then ho! for England!--In haste, yours most\r\naffectionately,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--The Discovery of Natural Selection\r\n\r\n    \"There are not many joys in human life equal to the joy of the\r\n    sudden birth of a generalisation, illuminating the mind after a\r\n    long period of patient research. What has seemed for years so\r\n    chaotic, so contradictory, and so problematic takes at once its\r\n    proper position within an harmonious whole. Out of the wild\r\n    confusion of facts and from behind the fog of\r\n    guesses--contradicted almost as soon as they are born--a stately\r\n    picture makes its appearance, like an Alpine chain suddenly\r\n    emerging in all its grandeur from the mists which concealed it the\r\n    moment before, glittering under the rays of the sun in all its\r\n    simplicity and variety, in all its mightiness and beauty. And when\r\n    the generalisation is put to a test, by applying it to hundreds of\r\n    separate facts which seemed to be hopelessly contradictory the\r\n    moment before, each of them assumes its due position, increasing\r\n    the impressiveness of the picture, accentuating some\r\n    characteristic outline, or adding an unsuspected detail full of\r\n    meaning. The generalisation gains in strength and extent; its\r\n    foundations grow in width and solidity; while in the distance,\r\n    through the far-off mist on the horizon, the eye detects the\r\n    outlines of new and still wider generalisations. He who has once\r\n    in his life experienced this joy of scientific creation will never\r\n    forget it; he will be longing to renew it; and he cannot but feel\r\n    with pain that this sort of happiness is the lot of so few of us,\r\n    while so many could also live through it--on a small or on a grand\r\n    scale--if scientific methods and leisure were not limited to a\r\n    handful of men.\"--PRINCE KROPOTKIN, \"Memoirs of a Revolutionist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe social and scientific atmosphere in which Wallace found himself on\r\nhis return from his eight years' exile in the Malay Archipelago was\r\nconsiderably more genial than that which he had enjoyed during his\r\nprevious stay in London following his exploration of the Amazon. His\r\nposition as one of the leading scientists of the day was already\r\nrecognised, dating from the memorable 1st of July, 1858, when the two\r\nPapers, his own and Darwin's, on the theory of Natural Selection had\r\nbeen read before the Linnean Society.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years which had elapsed since that date the storm of\r\ncriticism had waxed and waned; subsiding for a time only to burst out\r\nafresh from some new quarter where the theory bade fair to jeopardise\r\nsome ancient belief in which scientist or theologian had rested with\r\ncomparative satisfaction until so rudely disturbed.\r\n\r\nDuring this period Wallace had been quietly pursuing his researches in\r\nthe Malay Archipelago, though not without a keen interest in all that\r\nwas taking place at home in so far as this reached him by means of\r\ncorrespondence and newspaper reports--his only means of keeping in touch\r\nwith the world beyond the boundaries of the semi-civilised countries in\r\nwhich he was then living.\r\n\r\nIn order to follow the story of how the conception of the theory of\r\nNatural Selection grew and eventually took definite form in Wallace's\r\nmind, independently of the same development in the mind of Darwin, we\r\nmust go back to a much earlier period in his life, and as nearly as\r\npossible link up, the scattered remarks which here and there act as\r\nsignposts pointing towards the supreme solution which has made his name\r\nfamous for all time.\r\n\r\nIn Part I., Section I., many passages occur which clearly reveal his\r\nawakening to the study of nature. A chance remark overheard in\r\nconversation in the quiet street of Hertford touched the hidden spring\r\nof interest in a subject which was to become the one great purpose of\r\nhis life. Then his enthusiastic yielding to the simple and natural\r\nattraction which flowers and trees have always exerted upon the\r\nsympathetic observer led step by step to the study of groups and\r\nfamilies, until, on his second sojourn at Neath, and about a year before\r\nhis journey to South America with H.W. Bates, we find him deliberately\r\npondering over the problem which many years later he described by saying\r\nthat he \"had in fact been bitten by the passion for species and their\r\ndescription.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Bates dated November 9th, 1847, he concludes by asking,\r\n\"Have you read 'Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation,' or is it\r\nout of your line?\" and in the next (dated December 28th), in reply to\r\none from his friend, he continues, \"I have a rather more favourable\r\nopinion of the 'Vestiges' than you appear to have, I do not consider it\r\na hasty generalisation, but rather an ingenious hypothesis strongly\r\nsupported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be\r\nproved by more facts and the additional light which more research may\r\nthrow upon the problem.... It furnishes a subject for every observer of\r\nnature to attend to; every fact,\" he observes, \"will make either for or\r\nagainst it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection\r\nof facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.\r\nMany eminent writers support the theory of the progressive development\r\nof animals and plants. There is a very philosophical work bearing\r\ndirectly on the question--Lawrence's 'Lectures on Man'.... The great\r\nobject of these 'Lectures' is to illustrate the different races of\r\nmankind, and the manner in which they probably originated, and he\r\narrives at the conclusion (as also does Prichard in his work on the\r\n'Physical History of Man') that the varieties of the human race have not\r\nbeen produced by any external causes, but are due to the development of\r\ncertain distinctive peculiarities in some individuals which have\r\nthereafter become propagated through an entire race. Now, I should say\r\nthat a permanent peculiarity not produced by external causes is a\r\ncharacteristic of 'species' and not of mere 'variety,' and thus, if the\r\ntheory of the 'Vestiges' is accepted, the Negro, the Red Indian, and the\r\nEuropean are distinct species of the genus Homo.\r\n\r\n\"An animal which differs from another by some decided and permanent\r\ncharacter, however slight, which difference is undiminished by\r\npropagation and unchanged by climate and external circumstances, is\r\nuniversally held to be a distinct _species_; while one which is not\r\nregularly transmitted so as to form a distinct race, but is occasionally\r\nreproduced from the parent stock (like albinoes), is generally, if the\r\ndifference is not very considerable, classed as a _variety_. But I would\r\nclass both these as distinct _species_, and I would only consider those\r\nto be _varieties_ whose differences are produced by external causes, and\r\nwhich, therefore, are not propagated as distinct races.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, writing about the same period, he adds: \"I begin to feel rather\r\ndissatisfied with a mere local collection; little is to be learnt by it.\r\nI should like to take some one family to study thoroughly, principally\r\nwith a view to the theory of the origin of species. By that means I am\r\nstrongly of opinion that some definite results might be arrived at.\" And\r\nhe further alludes to \"my favourite subject--the variations,\r\narrangements, distribution, etc., of species.\"[17]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in Bates Wallace found his first real friend and\r\ncompanion in matters scientific; for in another letter he says: \"I quite\r\nenvy you, who have friends near you attracted to the same pursuits. I\r\nknow not a single person in this little town who studies any one branch\r\nof natural history, so that I am quite alone in this respect.\" In fact,\r\nexcept for a little friendly help now and then, as in the case of Mr.\r\nHayward lending him a copy of Loudon's Encyclopedia of Plants, he had\r\nalways pondered over his nature studies without any assistance up to the\r\ntime of his meeting Bates at Leicester.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the above letter (1847) on to the early part of\r\n1855--nearly eight years later--no reference is found either in his Life\r\nor correspondence to the one absorbing idea towards which all his\r\nreflective powers were being directed. Then, during a quiet time at\r\nSarawak, the accumulation of thought and observation found expression in\r\nan essay entitled \"The Law which has regulated the Introduction of\r\nSpecies,\" which appeared in the _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_\r\nin the following September (1855).\r\n\r\nFrom November, 1854, the year of his arrival in the East, until January\r\nor February, 1856, Sarawak was the centre from which Wallace made his\r\nexplorations inland, including some adventurous excursions on the Sadong\r\nRiver. During the wet season--or spring--of 1855, while living in a\r\nsmall house at the foot of the Santubong Mountains (with one Malay boy\r\nwho acted as cook and general companion), he tells us how he occupied\r\nhis time in looking over his books and pondering \"over the problem which\r\nwas rarely absent from [his] thoughts.\" In addition to the knowledge he\r\nhad acquired from reading such books as those by Swainson and Humboldt,\r\nalso Lucien Bonaparte's \"Conspectus,\" and several catalogues of insects\r\nand reptiles in the British Museum \"giving a mass of facts\" as to the\r\ndistribution of animals over the whole world, and having by his own\r\nefforts accumulated a vast store of information and facts direct from\r\nnature while in South America and since coming out East, he arrived at\r\nthe conclusion that this \"mass of facts\" had never been properly\r\nutilised as an indication of the way in which species had come into\r\nexistence. Having no fellow-traveller to whom he could confide these\r\nconclusions, he was almost driven to put his thoughts and ideas on\r\npaper--weighing each argument with studious care and open-eyed\r\nconsideration as to its bearing on the whole theory. As the \"result\r\nseemed to be of some importance,\" it was sent, as already mentioned, to\r\nthe _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_ as one of the leading\r\nscientific journals in England.\r\n\r\nIn the light of future events it is not surprising that Huxley (many\r\nyears later), in referring to this \"powerful essay,\" adds: \"On reading\r\nit afresh I have been astonished to recollect how small was the\r\nimpression it made.\"\r\n\r\nAs this earliest contribution by Wallace to the doctrine of Evolution[18]\r\nis of peculiar historical value, and has not been so fully recognised as\r\nit undoubtedly deserves, and is now almost inaccessible, it will be\r\nuseful to indicate in his own words the clear line of argument put forth\r\nby him two years before his second essay with which many readers are\r\nmore familiar. He begins:\r\n\r\n    Every naturalist who has directed his attention to the subject of\r\n    the geographical distribution of animals and plants must have been\r\n    interested in the singular facts which it presents. Many of these\r\n    facts are quite different from what would have been anticipated,\r\n    and have hitherto been considered as highly curious but quite\r\n    inexplicable. None of the explanations attempted from the time of\r\n    Linnæus are now considered at all satisfactory; none of them have\r\n    given a cause sufficient to account for the facts known at the\r\n    time, or comprehensive enough to include all the new facts which\r\n    have since been and are daily being added. Of late years, however,\r\n    a great light has been thrown upon the subject by geological\r\n    investigations, which have shown that the present state of the\r\n    earth, and the organisms now inhabiting it, are but the last stage\r\n    of a long and uninterrupted series of changes which it has\r\n    undergone, and consequently, that to endeavour to explain and\r\n    account for its present condition without any reference to those\r\n    changes (as has frequently been done) must lead to very imperfect\r\n    and erroneous conclusions.... The following propositions in\r\n    Organic Geography and Geology give the main facts on which the\r\n    hypothesis [_see_ p. 96] is founded.\r\n\r\n    GEOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n    (1) Large groups, such as classes and orders, are generally spread\r\n    over the whole earth, while smaller ones, such as families and\r\n    genera, are frequently confined to one portion, often to a very\r\n    limited district.\r\n\r\n    (2) In widely distributed families the genera are often limited in\r\n    range; in widely distributed genera, well-marked groups of species\r\n    are peculiar to each geographical district.\r\n\r\n    (3) When a group is confined to one district and is rich in\r\n    species, it is almost invariably the case that the most closely\r\n    allied species are found in the same locality or in closely\r\n    adjoining localities, and that therefore the natural sequence of\r\n    the species by affinity is also geographical.\r\n\r\n    (4) In countries of a similar climate, but separated by a wide sea\r\n    or lofty mountains, the families, genera and species of the one\r\n    are often represented by closely allied families, genera and\r\n    species peculiar to the other.\r\n\r\n    GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n    (5) The distribution of the organic world in time is very similar\r\n    to its present distribution in space.\r\n\r\n    (6) Most of the larger and some of the smaller groups extend\r\n    through several geological periods.\r\n\r\n    (7) In each period, however, there are peculiar groups, found\r\n    nowhere else, and extending through one or several formations.\r\n\r\n    (8) Species of one genus, or genera of one family, occurring in\r\n    the same geological time are more closely allied than those\r\n    separated in time.\r\n\r\n    (9) As generally in geography no species or genus occurs in two\r\n    very distant localities without being also found in intermediate\r\n    places, so in geology the life of a species or genus has not been\r\n    interrupted. In other words, no group or species has come into\r\n    existence twice.\r\n\r\n    (10) The following law may be deduced from these facts: _Every\r\n    species has come into existence coincident both in time and space\r\n    with a pre-existing closely allied species_.\r\n\r\n    This law agrees with, explains and illustrates all the facts\r\n    connected with the following branches of the subject: 1st, the\r\n    system of natural affinities; 2nd, the distribution of animals and\r\n    plants in space; 3rd, the same in time, including all the\r\n    phenomena of representative groups, and those which Prof. Forbes\r\n    supposed to manifest polarity; 4th, the phenomena of rudimentary\r\n    organs. We will briefly endeavour to show its bearing upon each of\r\n    these.\r\n\r\n    If [this] law be true, it follows that the natural series of\r\n    affinities will also represent the order in which the several\r\n    species came into existence, each one having had for its immediate\r\n    antetype a clearly allied species existing at the time of its\r\n    origin.... If two or more species have been independently formed\r\n    on the plan of a common antetype, then the series of affinities\r\n    will be compound, and can only be represented by a forked or\r\n    many-branched line.... Sometimes the series of affinities can be\r\n    well represented for a space by a direct progression from species\r\n    to species or from group to group, but it is generally found\r\n    impossible so to continue. There constantly occur two or more\r\n    modifications of an organ or modifications of two distinct organs,\r\n    leading us on to two distinct series of species, which at length\r\n    differ so much from each other as to form distinct genera or\r\n    families. These are the parallel series or representative groups\r\n    of naturalists, and they often occur in different countries, or\r\n    are found fossil in different formations.... We thus see how\r\n    difficult it is to determine in every case whether a given\r\n    relation is an analogy or an affinity, for it is evident that as\r\n    we go back along the parallel or divergent series, towards the\r\n    common antetype, the analogy which existed between the two groups\r\n    becomes an affinity.... Again, if we consider that we have only\r\n    the fragments of this vast system, the stems and main branches\r\n    being represented by extinct species of which we have no\r\n    knowledge, while a vast mass of limbs and boughs and minute twigs\r\n    and scattered leaves is what we have to place in order, and\r\n    determine the true position each originally occupied with regard\r\n    to the others, the whole difficulty of the true Natural System of\r\n    classification becomes apparent to us.\r\n\r\n    We shall thus find ourselves obliged to reject all those systems\r\n    of classification which arrange species or groups in circles, as\r\n    well as those which fix a definite number for the division of each\r\n    group.... We have ... never been able to find a case in which the\r\n    circle has been closed by a direct affinity. In most cases a\r\n    palpable analogy has been substituted, in others the affinity is\r\n    very obscure or altogether doubtful....\r\n\r\n    If we now consider the geographical distribution of animals and\r\n    plants upon the earth, we shall find all the facts beautifully in\r\n    accordance with, and readily explained by, the present hypothesis.\r\n    A country having species, genera, and whole families peculiar to\r\n    it will be the necessary result of its having been isolated for a\r\n    long period, sufficient for many series of species to have been\r\n    created on the type of pre-existing ones, which, as well as many\r\n    of the earlier-formed species, have become extinct, and made the\r\n    groups appear isolated....\r\n\r\n    Such phenomena as are exhibited by the Galapagos Islands, which\r\n    contain little groups of plants and animals peculiar to\r\n    themselves, but most nearly allied to those of South America, have\r\n    not hitherto received any, even a conjectural explanation. The\r\n    Galapagos are a volcanic group of high antiquity and have probably\r\n    never been more closely connected with the continent than they are\r\n    at present.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds at some length to explain how the Galapagos must have\r\nbeen at first \"peopled ... by the action of winds and currents,\" and\r\nthat the modified prototypes remaining are the \"new species\" which have\r\nbeen \"created in each on the plan of the pre-existing ones.\" This is\r\nfollowed by a graphic sketch of the general effect of volcanic and\r\nother action as affecting the distribution of species, and the exact\r\nform in which they are found, even fishes giving \"evidence of a similar\r\nkind: each great river [having] its peculiar genera, and in more\r\nextensive genera its groups of closely allied species.\"\r\n\r\nAfter stating a number of practical examples he continues:\r\n\r\n    The question forces itself upon every thinking mind--Why are these\r\n    things so? They could not be as they are, had no law regulated\r\n    their creation and dispersion. The law here enunciated not merely\r\n    explains, but necessitates the facts we see to exist, while the\r\n    vast and long-continued geological changes of the earth readily\r\n    account for the exceptions and apparent discrepancies that here\r\n    and there occur. The writer's object in putting forward his views\r\n    in the present imperfect manner is to submit them to the tests of\r\n    other minds, and to be made aware of all the facts supposed to be\r\n    inconsistent with them. As his hypothesis is one which claims\r\n    acceptance solely as explaining and connecting facts which exist\r\n    in nature, he expects facts alone to be brought forward to\r\n    disprove it, not _a priori_ arguments against its probability.\r\n\r\nHe then refers to some of the geological \"principles\" expounded by Sir\r\nCharles Lyell on the \"extinction of species,\" and follows this up by\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n    To discover how the extinct species have from time to time been\r\n    replaced by new ones down to the very latest geological period, is\r\n    the most difficult, and at the same time the most interesting,\r\n    problem in the natural history of the earth. The present inquiry,\r\n    which seeks to eliminate from known facts a law which has\r\n    determined, to a certain degree, what species could and did appear\r\n    at a given epoch, may, it is hoped, be considered as one step in\r\n    the right direction towards a complete solution of it.... Admitted\r\n    facts seem to show ... a general, but not a detailed\r\n    progression.... It is, however, by no means difficult to show\r\n    that a real progression in the scale of organisation is perfectly\r\n    consistent with all the appearances, and even with apparent\r\n    retrogression should such occur.\r\n\r\nUsing once more the analogy of a branching tree to illustrate the\r\nnatural arrangement of species and their successive creation, he clearly\r\nshows how \"apparent retrogression may be in reality a progress, though\r\nan interrupted one\"; as \"when some monarch of the forest loses a limb,\r\nit may be replaced by a feeble and sickly substitute.\" As an instance he\r\nmentions the Mollusca, which at an early period had reached a high state\r\nof development of forms and species, while in each succeeding age\r\nmodified species and genera replaced the former ones which had become\r\nextinct, and \"as we approach the present era but few and small\r\nrepresentatives of the group remain, while the Gasteropods and Bivalves\r\nhave acquired an immense preponderance.\" In the long series of changes\r\nthe earth had undergone, the process of peopling it with organic beings\r\nhad been continually going on, and whenever any of the higher groups had\r\nbecome nearly or quite extinct, the lower forms which better resisted\r\nthe modified physical conditions served as the antetype on which to\r\nfound new races. In this manner alone, it was believed, could the\r\nrepresentative groups of successive periods, and the risings and\r\nfallings in the scale of organisations, be in every case explained.\r\n\r\nAgain, attending to a recent article by Prof. Forbes, he points out\r\ncertain inaccuracies and how they may be proved to be so; and continues:\r\n\r\n    We have no reason for believing that the number of species on the\r\n    earth at any former period was much less than at present; at all\r\n    events the aquatic portion, with which the geologists have most\r\n    acquaintance, was probably often as great or greater. Now we know\r\n    that there have been many complete changes of species, new sets of\r\n    organisms have many times been introduced in place of old ones\r\n    which have become extinct, so that the total amount which have\r\n    existed on the earth from the earliest geological period must have\r\n    borne about the same proportion to those now living as the whole\r\n    human race who have lived and died upon the earth to the\r\n    population at the present time.... Records of vast geological\r\n    periods are entirely buried beneath the ocean ... beyond our\r\n    reach. Most of the gaps in the geological series may thus be\r\n    filled up, and vast numbers of unknown and unimaginable animals\r\n    which might help to elucidate the affinities of the numerous\r\n    isolated groups which are a perpetual puzzle to the zoologist may\r\n    be buried there, till future revolutions may raise them in turn\r\n    above the water, to afford materials for the study of whatever\r\n    race of intelligent beings may then have succeeded us. These\r\n    considerations must lead us to the conclusion that our knowledge\r\n    of the whole series of the former inhabitants of the earth is\r\n    necessarily most imperfect and fragmentary--as much as our\r\n    knowledge of the present organic world would be, were we forced to\r\n    make our collections and observations only in spots equally\r\n    limited in area and in number with those actually laid open for\r\n    the collection of fossils.... The hypothesis of Prof. Forbes is\r\n    essentially one that assumes to a great extent the _completeness_\r\n    of our knowledge of the _whole series_ of organic beings which\r\n    have existed on earth.... The hypothesis put forward in this paper\r\n    depends in no degree upon the completeness of our knowledge of the\r\n    former condition of the organic world, but takes what facts we\r\n    have as fragments of a vast whole, and deduces from them something\r\n    of the nature and proportion of that whole which we can never know\r\n    in detail....\r\n\r\n    Another important series of facts, quite in accordance with, and\r\n    even necessary deductions from, the law now developed, are those\r\n    of _rudimentary organs_. That these really do exist, and in most\r\n    cases have no special function in the animal economy, is admitted\r\n    by the first authorities in comparative anatomy. The minute limbs\r\n    hidden beneath the skin in many of the snake-like lizards, the\r\n    anal hooks of the boa constrictor, the complete series of jointed\r\n    finger-bones in the paddle of the manatee and the whale, are a few\r\n    of the most familiar instances. In botany a similar class of facts\r\n    has been long recognised. Abortive stamens, rudimentary floral\r\n    envelope and undeveloped carpels are of the most frequent\r\n    occurrence. To every thoughtful naturalist the question must\r\n    arise, What are these for? What have they to do with the great\r\n    laws of creation? Do they not teach us something of the system of\r\n    nature? If each species has been created independently, and\r\n    without any necessary relation with pre-existing species, what do\r\n    these rudiments, these apparent imperfections, mean? There must be\r\n    a cause for them; they must be the necessary result of some great\r\n    natural law. Now, if ... the great law which has regulated the\r\n    peopling of the earth with animal and vegetable life is, that\r\n    every change shall be gradual; that no new creature shall be\r\n    formed widely different from anything before existing; that in\r\n    this, as in everything else in nature, there shall be gradation\r\n    and harmony--then these rudimentary organs are necessary and are\r\n    an essential part of the system of nature. Ere the higher\r\n    vertebrates were formed, for instance, many steps were required,\r\n    and many organs had to undergo modifications from the rudimental\r\n    condition in which only they had as yet existed.... Many more of\r\n    these modifications should we behold, and more complete series of\r\n    them, had we a view of all the forms which have ceased to live.\r\n    The great gaps that exist ... would be softened down by\r\n    intermediate groups, and the whole organic world would be seen to\r\n    be an unbroken and harmonious system.\r\n\r\nThe article, in which we can see a great generalisation struggling to be\r\nborn, ends thus:\r\n\r\n    It has now been shown, though most briefly and imperfectly, how\r\n    the law that \"every species has come into existence coincident\r\n    both in time and space with a pre-existing closely allied\r\n    species,\" connects together and renders intelligible a vast number\r\n    of independent and hitherto unexplained facts. The natural system\r\n    of arrangement of organic beings, their geographical distribution,\r\n    their geological sequence, the phenomena of representative and\r\n    substituted groups in all their modifications, and the most\r\n    singular peculiarities of anatomical structure, are all explained\r\n    and illustrated by it, in perfect accordance with the vast mass of\r\n    facts which the researches of modern naturalists have brought\r\n    together, and, it is believed, not materially opposed to any of\r\n    them. It also claims a superiority over previous hypotheses, on\r\n    the ground that it not merely explains but necessitates what\r\n    exists. Granted the law, and many of the most important facts in\r\n    nature could not have been otherwise, but are almost as necessary\r\n    deductions from it as are the elliptic orbits of the planets from\r\n    the law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nSome time after the appearance of this article, Wallace was informed by\r\nhis friend and agent, Mr. Stevens, that several naturalists had\r\nexpressed regret that he was \"theorising,\" when what \"was wanted was to\r\ncollect more facts.\" Apart from this the only recognition which reached\r\nhim in his remote solitude was a remark in an approving letter from\r\nDarwin (_see_ p. 129).\r\n\r\nAs Wallace wrote nothing further of importance until the second essay\r\nwhich more fully disclosed his view of the origin of species, we will\r\nnow briefly trace the growth of the theory of Natural Selection up to\r\n1858, as it came to Darwin.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that during Darwin's voyage in the _Beagle_ he was\r\ndeeply impressed by discovering extinct armadillo-like fossil forms in\r\nSouth America, the home of armadilloes, and by observing the\r\nrelationship of the plants and animals of each island in the Galapagos\r\ngroup to those of the other islands and of South America, the nearest\r\ncontinent. These facts suggested evolution, and without evolution\r\nappeared to be meaningless.\r\n\r\nEvolution and its motive cause were the problems which \"haunted\" him for\r\nthe next twenty years. The first step towards a possible solution was\r\nthe \"opening of a notebook for facts in relation to the origin of\r\nspecies\" in 1837, two years before the publication of his Journal. From\r\nthe very commencement of his literary and scientific work, a rule\r\nrigidly adhered to was that of interspersing his main line of thought\r\nand research by reading books touching on widely diverging subjects; and\r\nit was thus, no doubt, that during October, 1838, he read \"for\r\namusement\" Malthus's \"Essay on Population\"; not, as he himself affirms,\r\nwith any definite idea as to its intimate bearing on the subject so near\r\nhis heart. But the immediate result was that the idea of Natural\r\nSelection at once arose in his mind, and, in his own words, he \"had a\r\ntheory by which to work.\"\r\n\r\nIn May and June, 1842, during a visit to Maer and Shrewsbury, he wrote\r\nhis first \"pencil sketch of Species theory,\" but not until two years\r\nlater (1844) did he venture to enlarge this to one of 230 folio pages,\r\n\"a wonderfully complete presentation of the arguments familiar to us in\r\nthe 'Origin.'\"[19]\r\n\r\nAlready, in addition to the mass of facts collected, Darwin was busy\r\nwith some of the experiments which he described in a letter to Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker (in 1855) as affording the latter a \"good right to sneer,\r\nfor they are so _absurd_, even in _my_ opinion, that I dare not tell\r\nyou.\" While a sentence in another letter (dated 1849) throws a sidelight\r\non all this preparatory work: \"In your letter you wonder what\r\n'ornamental poultry' has to do with barnacles; but do not flatter\r\nyourself that I shall not yet live to finish the barnacles, and then\r\nmake a fool of myself on the subject of species, under which head\r\nornamental poultry are very interesting.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhere about this time (1842-44), Darwin, referring to the idea of\r\nNatural Selection which arose in his mind after reading Malthus on\r\n\"Population\" four years earlier, continues: \"But at that time I\r\noverlooked one problem of great importance ... the tendency in organic\r\nbeings descended from the same stock to diverge in character as they\r\nbecome modified ... and I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst\r\nin my carriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me.... The\r\nsolution, as I believe, is that the modified offspring of all dominant\r\nand increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly\r\ndiversified places in the economy of nature.\"[20]\r\n\r\nSo convinced was he of the truth of his ideas as expressed in the 1844\r\nMS., that immediately after its completion he wrote the memorable letter\r\nto Mrs. Darwin telling her what he would wish done regarding its\r\npublication in the event of his death.\r\n\r\nIt was probably about two years later (1846) that he first confided his\r\ncompleted work--up to that date--to Sir Joseph Hooker, and later to Sir\r\nCharles Lyell; refraining, however, except in general conversation with\r\nother scientists, from informing anyone of the progress he was making\r\ntowards a positive solution of the problem. His attitude of mind and\r\nmanner at this period is happily illustrated by Huxley, who, speaking of\r\nhis early acquaintance with Darwin, says: \"I remember in the course of\r\nmy first interview with Darwin expressing my belief in the sharpness of\r\nthe line of demarcation between natural groups and in the absence of\r\ntransitional forms, with all the confidence of youth and imperfect\r\nknowledge. I was not aware, at that time, that he had then been many\r\nyears brooding over the Species question; and the humorous smile which\r\naccompanied his gentle answer, that such was not altogether his view,\r\nlong haunted and puzzled me.\"\r\n\r\nLittle did Charles Darwin dream that, only three years after this first\r\nMS. was written (in 1844), a youthful naturalist--known only as a\r\nsurveyor at Neath--was deliberately pondering over the same issue, and\r\nwriting to his only scientific friend on the subject. As, however, the\r\ndifferent methods of thought by which they arrived at the same\r\nconclusion is so aptly related by Wallace himself, we will leave it for\r\nhim to tell the story in its appointed place.[21]\r\n\r\nIn 1856, the year following the appearance of Wallace's essay in the\r\n_Annals and Magazine of Natural History_, both Hooker and Lyell urged\r\nDarwin to publish the result of his long and patient research. But he\r\nwas still reluctant to do so, not having as yet satisfied himself with\r\nregard to certain conclusions which, he felt, must be stoutly maintained\r\nin face of the enormous amount of criticism which would arise\r\nimmediately his theory was launched on the scientific world. And thus\r\nthe event was postponed until the memorable year 1858.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1856 no correspondence had passed between Wallace and\r\nDarwin, so far, at least, as the former could remember, for he says, in\r\na letter dated Frith Hill, Godalming, December 3, 1887 (written to Mr.\r\nA. Newton): \"I had hardly heard of Darwin before going to the East,\r\nexcept as connected with the voyage of the _Beagle_.... I saw him _once_\r\nfor a few minutes in the British Museum before I sailed. Through\r\nStevens, my agent, I heard that he wanted curious _varieties_ which he\r\nwas studying. I _think_ I wrote about some varieties of ducks I had\r\nsent, and he must have written once to me.... But at that time I had\r\nnot the remotest notion that he had already arrived at a definite\r\ntheory--still less that it was the same as occurred to me, suddenly, in\r\nTernate in 1858.\" It is clear, therefore, that the essay written at\r\nSarawak formed the first real link with Darwin, although not fully\r\nrecognised at the time. In May, 1857, Darwin wrote to Wallace: \"I am\r\nmuch obliged for your letter ... and even still more by your paper in\r\nthe _Annals_, a year or more ago. I can plainly see that we have thought\r\nmuch alike and to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions....\r\nI agree to almost every word of your paper; and I dare say that you will\r\nagree with me that it is very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty\r\nclosely with any theoretical paper.\" He concludes: \"You have my very\r\nsincere and cordial good wishes for success of all kinds, and may all\r\nyour theories succeed, except that on Oceanic Islands, on which subject\r\nI will do battle to the death.\"\r\n\r\nThe three years from 1855 to 1858 were for Wallace crowded with hard\r\nwork, and perilous voyages by sea and hardships by land. January, 1858,\r\nfound him at Amboyna, where, in all probability, he found a pile of\r\nlong-delayed correspondence awaiting him, and among this a letter from\r\nBates referring to the article which had appeared in print September,\r\n1855. In reply he says: \"To persons who have not thought much on the\r\nsubject I fear my paper on the 'Succession of Species' will not appear\r\nso clear as it does to you. That paper is, of course, merely the\r\nannouncement of the theory, not its development. I have prepared the\r\nplan and written portions of a work embracing the whole subject, and\r\nhave endeavoured to prove in detail what I have as yet only\r\nindicated.... I have been much gratified by a letter from Darwin, in\r\nwhich he says that he agrees with 'almost every word' of my paper. He\r\nis now preparing his great work on 'Species and Varieties,' for which he\r\nhas been preparing materials for twenty years. He may save me the\r\ntrouble of writing more on my hypothesis, by proving that there is no\r\ndifference in nature between the origin of species and of varieties; or\r\nhe may give me trouble by arriving at another conclusion; but, at all\r\nevents, his facts will be given for me to work upon. Your collections\r\nand my own will furnish most valuable material to illustrate and prove\r\nthe universal application of the hypothesis. The connection between the\r\nsuccession of affinities and the geographical distribution of a group,\r\nworked out species by species, has never yet been shown as we shall be\r\nable to show it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This letter proves,\" writes Wallace,[22] \"that at this time I had not\r\nthe least idea of the nature of Darwin's proposed work nor of the\r\ndefinite conclusions he had arrived at, nor had I myself any\r\nexpectations of a complete solution of the great problem to which my\r\npaper was merely the prelude. Yet less than two months later that\r\nsolution flashed upon me, and to a large extent marked out a different\r\nline of work from that which I had up to this time anticipated.... In\r\nother parts of this letter I refer to the work I hoped to do myself in\r\ndescribing, cataloguing, and working out the distribution of my insects.\r\nI had in fact been bitten by the passion for species and their\r\ndescription, and if neither Darwin nor myself had hit upon 'Natural\r\nSelection,' I might have spent the best years of my life in this\r\ncomparatively profitless work. But the new ideas swept all this away.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was finished after his arrival at Ternate, and a few weeks\r\nlater he was prostrated by a sharp attack of intermittent fever which\r\nobliged him to take a prolonged rest each day, owing to the exhausting\r\nhot and cold fits which rapidly succeeded one another.\r\n\r\nThe little bungalow at Ternate had now come to be regarded as \"home\" for\r\nit was here that he stored all his treasured collections, besides making\r\nit the goal of all his wanderings in the Archipelago. One can\r\nunderstand, therefore, that, in spite of the fever, there was a sense of\r\nsatisfaction in the feeling that he was surrounded with the trophies of\r\nhis arduous labours as a naturalist, and this passion for species and\r\ntheir descriptions being an ever-present speculation in his mind, his\r\nvery surroundings would unconsciously conduce towards the line of\r\nthought which brought to memory the argument of \"positive checks\" set\r\nforth by Malthus in his \"Principles of Population\" (read twelve years\r\nearlier) as applied to savage and civilised races. \"It then,\" he says,\r\n\"occurred to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually\r\nacting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much\r\nmore rapidly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these\r\ncauses must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each\r\nspecies, since they evidently do not increase regularly from year to\r\nyear, as otherwise the world would have been densely crowded with those\r\nthat breed most quickly.... Then it suddenly flashed upon me that this\r\nself-acting process would necessarily _improve the race_, because in\r\nevery generation the inferior would inevitably be killed off and the\r\nsuperior would remain--that is, the _fittest would survive_. Then at\r\nonce I seemed to see the whole effect of this, that when changes of land\r\nand sea, or of climate, or of food-supply, or of enemies occurred--and\r\nwe know that such changes have always been taking place--and considering\r\nthe amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had\r\nshown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for\r\nthe adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be\r\nbrought about; and as great changes in the environment are always slow,\r\nthere would be ample time for the change to be effected by the survival\r\nof the best fitted in every generation. In this way every part of an\r\nanimal's organism could be modified as required, and in the very process\r\nof this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the\r\n_definite_ characters and the clear _isolation_ of each new species\r\nwould be explained. The more I thought over it the more I became\r\nconvinced that I had at length found the long-sought-for law of nature\r\nthat solved the problem of the origin of species. For the next hour I\r\nthought over the deficiencies in the theories of Lamarck and of the\r\nauthor of the 'Vestiges,' and I saw that my new theory supplemented\r\nthese views and obviated every important difficulty. I waited anxiously\r\nfor the termination of my fit (of fever) so that I might at once make\r\nnotes for a paper on the subject. The same evening I did this pretty\r\nfully, and on the two succeeding evenings wrote it out carefully in\r\norder to send it to Darwin by the next post, which would leave in a day\r\nor two.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThe story of the arrival of this letter at Down, and of the swift\r\npassage of events between the date on which Darwin received it and the\r\nreading of the \"joint communications\" before the Linnean Society, has\r\nbeen often told. But few, perhaps, have enjoyed the privilege of reading\r\nthe account of this memorable proceeding as related by Sir Joseph Hooker\r\nat the celebration of the event held by the Linnean Society in 1908.\r\n\r\nAs, therefore, the correspondence (pp. 127-320) between Wallace and\r\nDarwin during a long series of years conveys many expressions of their\r\nmutual appreciation of each other's work in connection with the origin\r\nof species, it will avoid a possible repetition of these if we take a\r\nlong leap forward and give the notable speeches made by Wallace, Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, Sir E. Ray Lankester, and others at this historical\r\nceremony, which have not been published except in the _Proceedings_ of\r\nthe Society, now out of print.\r\n\r\nThe gathering was held on July 1, 1908, at the Institute of Civil\r\nEngineers, Great George Street, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe joint communication made by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace\r\nto the Linnean Society, \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties;\r\nand on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of\r\nSelection.\" The large gathering included the President, Dr. Dukinfield\r\nH. Scott, distinguished representatives of many scientific Societies and\r\nUniversities, the Danish and Swedish Ministers, and a representative\r\nfrom the German Embassy. Most of the members of Dr. Wallace's and Mr.\r\nDarwin's family were also present.[24] The President opened with some\r\nexplanatory observations, and then invited Wallace to come forward in\r\norder to receive the first Darwin-Wallace Medal. In presenting it he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace,--We rejoice that we are so happy as to\r\n    have with us to-day the survivor of the two great naturalists\r\n    whose crowning work we are here to commemorate.\r\n\r\n    Your brilliant work in natural history and geography, and as one\r\n    of the founders of the theory of Evolution by Natural Selection,\r\n    is universally honoured and has often received public recognition,\r\n    as in the awards of the Darwin and Royal Medals of the Royal\r\n    Society, and of our Medal in 1892.\r\n\r\n    To-day, in asking you to accept the first Darwin-Wallace Medal, we\r\n    are offering you of your own, for it is you, equally with your\r\n    great colleague, who created the occasion we celebrate.\r\n\r\n    There is nothing in the history of science more delightful or more\r\n    noble than the story of the relations between yourself and Mr.\r\n    Darwin, as told in the correspondence now so fully published--the\r\n    story of a generous rivalry in which each discoverer strives to\r\n    exalt the claims of the other. We know that Mr. Darwin wrote\r\n    (April 6th, 1859): \"You cannot tell how much I admire your spirit\r\n    in the manner in which you have taken all that was done about\r\n    publishing our papers. I had actually written a letter to you\r\n    stating that I would not publish anything before you had\r\n    published.\" Then came the letters of Hooker and Lyell, leading to\r\n    the publication of the joint papers which they communicated.\r\n\r\n    You, on your side, always gave the credit to him, and\r\n    underestimated your own position as the co-discoverer. I need only\r\n    refer to your calling your great exposition of the joint theory\r\n    \"Darwinism,\" as the typical example of your generous emphasising\r\n    of the claims of your illustrious fellow-worker.\r\n\r\n    It was a remarkable and momentous coincidence that both you and he\r\n    should have independently arrived at the idea of Natural Selection\r\n    after reading Malthus's book, and a most happy inspiration that\r\n    you should have selected Mr. Darwin as the naturalist to whom to\r\n    communicate your discovery. That theory, in spite of changes in\r\n    the scientific fashion of the moment, you have always\r\n    unflinchingly maintained, and still uphold as unshaken by all\r\n    attacks.\r\n\r\n    Like Mr. Darwin, you, if I may say so, are above all a naturalist,\r\n    a student and lover of living animals and plants, as shown in\r\n    later years by your enthusiasm and success in gardening. It is to\r\n    such men, those who have learnt the ways of Nature, as Nature\r\n    really is in the open, to whom your doctrine of Natural Selection\r\n    specially appeals, and therein lies its great and lasting\r\n    strength.\r\n\r\n    Finally, you must allow me to allude to the generous interest you\r\n    have always shown, and continue to show, in the careers of\r\n    younger men who are endeavouring to follow in your steps.\r\n\r\n    I ask you, Dr. Wallace, to accept this Medal, struck in your\r\n    honour and in that of the great work inaugurated fifty years ago\r\n    by Mr. Darwin and yourself.\r\n\r\nWallace began his reply by thanking the Council of the Society for the\r\nHonour they had done him, and then proceeded:\r\n\r\n    Since the death of Darwin, in 1882, I have found myself in the\r\n    somewhat unusual position of receiving credit and praise from\r\n    popular writers under a complete misapprehension of what my share\r\n    in Darwin's work really amounted to. It has been stated (not\r\n    unfrequently) in the daily and weekly press, that Darwin and\r\n    myself discovered \"Natural Selection\" simultaneously, while a more\r\n    daring few have declared that I was _the first_ to discover it,\r\n    and I gave way to Darwin!\r\n\r\n    In order to avoid further errors of this kind (which this\r\n    Celebration may possibly encourage), I think it will be well to\r\n    give the actual facts as simply and clearly as possible.\r\n\r\n    The _one fact_ that connects me with Darwin, and which, I am happy\r\n    to say, has never been doubted, is that the idea of what is now\r\n    termed \"natural selection\" or \"survival of the fittest,\" together\r\n    with its far-reaching consequences, occurred to us\r\n    _independently_, and was first jointly announced before this\r\n    Society fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n    But, what is often forgotten by the Press and the public is, that\r\n    the idea occurred to Darwin in 1838, nearly twenty years earlier\r\n    than to myself (in February, 1858); and that during the whole of\r\n    that twenty years he had been laboriously collecting evidence from\r\n    the vast mass of literature of biology, of horticulture, and of\r\n    agriculture; as well as himself carrying out ingenious experiments\r\n    and original observations, the extent of which is indicated by the\r\n    range of subjects discussed in his \"Origin of Species,\" and\r\n    especially in that wonderful storehouse of knowledge, his \"Animals\r\n    and Plants under Domestication,\" almost the whole materials for\r\n    which work had been collected, and to a large extent systematised,\r\n    during that twenty years.\r\n\r\n    So far back as 1844, at a time when I had hardly thought of any\r\n    serious study of nature, Darwin had written an outline of his\r\n    views, which he communicated to his friends Sir Charles Lyell and\r\n    Dr. (now Sir Joseph) Hooker. The former strongly urged him to\r\n    publish an abstract of his theory as soon as possible, lest some\r\n    other person might precede him; but he always refused till he had\r\n    got together the whole of the materials for his intended great\r\n    work. Then, at last, Lyell's prediction was fulfilled, and,\r\n    without any apparent warning, my letter, with the enclosed essay,\r\n    came upon him, like a thunderbolt from a cloudless sky! This\r\n    forced him to what he considered a premature publicity, and his\r\n    two friends undertook to have our two papers read before this\r\n    Society.\r\n\r\n    How different from this long study and preparation--this\r\n    philosophical caution--this determination not to make known his\r\n    fruitful conception till he could back it up by overwhelming\r\n    proofs--was my own conduct.\r\n\r\n    The idea came to me as it had come to Darwin, in a sudden flash of\r\n    insight; it was thought out in a few hours--was written down with\r\n    such a sketch of its various applications and developments as\r\n    occurred to me at the moment--then copied on thin letter paper and\r\n    sent off to Darwin--all within one week. _I_ was then (as often\r\n    since) the \"young man in a hurry\": _he_, the painstaking and\r\n    patient student seeking ever the full demonstration of the truth\r\n    that he had discovered, rather than to achieve immediate personal\r\n    fame.\r\n\r\n    Such being the actual facts of the case, I should have had no\r\n    cause for complaint if the respective shares of Darwin and myself\r\n    in regard to the elucidation of Nature's method of organic\r\n    development had been henceforth estimated as being, roughly,\r\n    proportional to the time we had each bestowed upon it when it was\r\n    thus first given to the world--that is to say, as twenty years is\r\n    to one week. For, he had already made it his own. If the\r\n    persuasion of his friends had prevailed with him, and he had\r\n    published his theory after ten years'--fifteen years'--or even\r\n    eighteen years' elaboration of it--_I_ should have had no part in\r\n    it whatever, and _he_ would have been at once recognised as the\r\n    sole and undisputed discoverer and patient investigator of this\r\n    great law of \"Natural Selection\" in all its far-reaching\r\n    consequences.\r\n\r\n    It was really a singular piece of good luck that gave to me any\r\n    share whatever in the discovery. During the first half of the\r\n    nineteenth century (and even earlier) many great biological\r\n    thinkers and workers had been pondering over the problem and had\r\n    even suggested ingenious but inadequate solutions. Some of these\r\n    men were among the greatest intellects of our time, yet, till\r\n    Darwin, all had failed; and it was only Darwin's extreme desire to\r\n    perfect his work that allowed me to come in, as a very bad second,\r\n    in the truly Olympian race in which all philosophical biologists,\r\n    from Buffon and Erasmus Darwin to Richard Owen and Robert\r\n    Chambers, were more or less actively engaged.\r\n\r\n    And this brings me to the very interesting question: Why did so\r\n    many of the greatest intellects fail, while Darwin and myself hit\r\n    upon the solution of this problem--a solution which this\r\n    Celebration proves to have been (and still to be) a satisfying one\r\n    to a large number of those best able to form a judgment on its\r\n    merits? As I have found what seems to me a good and precise answer\r\n    to this question, and one which is of some psychological interest,\r\n    I will, with your permission, briefly state what it is.\r\n\r\n    On a careful consideration, we find a curious series of\r\n    correspondences, both in mind and in environment, which led Darwin\r\n    and myself, alone among our contemporaries, to reach identically\r\n    the same theory.\r\n\r\n    First (and most important, as I believe), in early life both\r\n    Darwin and myself became ardent beetle-hunters. Now there is\r\n    certainly no group of organisms that so impresses the collector by\r\n    the almost infinite number of its specific forms, the endless\r\n    modifications of structure, shape, colour, and surface-markings\r\n    that distinguish them from each other, and their innumerable\r\n    adaptations to diverse environments. These interesting features\r\n    are exhibited almost as strikingly in temperate as in tropical\r\n    regions, our own comparatively limited island-fauna possessing\r\n    more than 3,000 species of this one order of insects.\r\n\r\n    Again, both Darwin and myself had what he terms \"the mere passion\r\n    for collecting,\" not that of studying the minutiæ of structure,\r\n    either internal or external. I should describe it rather as an\r\n    intense interest in the variety of living things--the variety that\r\n    catches the eye of the observer even among those which are very\r\n    much alike, but which are soon found to differ in several distinct\r\n    characters.\r\n\r\n    Now it is this superficial and almost child-like interest in the\r\n    outward forms of living things which, though often despised as\r\n    unscientific, happened to be _the only one_ which would lead us\r\n    towards a solution of the problem of species. For Nature herself\r\n    distinguishes her species by just such characters--often\r\n    exclusively so, always in some degree--very small changes in\r\n    outline, or in the proportions of appendages--as give a quite\r\n    distinct and recognisable facies to each, often aided by slight\r\n    peculiarities in motion or habit; while in a larger number of\r\n    cases differences of surface-texture, of colour, or in the details\r\n    of the same general scheme of colour-pattern or of shading, give\r\n    an unmistakable individuality to closely allied species.\r\n\r\n    It is the constant search for and detection of these often\r\n    unexpected differences between very similar creatures that gives\r\n    such an intellectual charm and fascination to the mere collection\r\n    of these insects; and when, as in the case of Darwin and myself,\r\n    the collectors were of a speculative turn of mind, they were\r\n    constantly led to think upon the \"why\" and the \"how\" of all this\r\n    wonderful variety in nature--this overwhelming and, at first\r\n    sight, purposeless wealth of specific forms among the very\r\n    humblest forms of life.\r\n\r\n    Then, a little later (and with both of us almost accidentally) we\r\n    became travellers, collectors, and observers, in some of the\r\n    richest and most interesting portions of the earth; and we thus\r\n    had forced upon our attention all the strange phenomena of local\r\n    and geographical distribution, with the numerous problems to\r\n    which they give rise. Thenceforward our interest in the great\r\n    mystery of _how_ species came into existence was intensified,\r\n    and--again to use Darwin's expression--\"haunted\" us.\r\n\r\n    Finally, both Darwin and myself, at the critical period when our\r\n    minds were freshly stored with a considerable body of personal\r\n    observation and reflection bearing upon the problem to be solved,\r\n    had our attention directed to the system of _positive checks_ as\r\n    expounded by Malthus in his \"Principles of Population.\" The effect\r\n    of that was analogous to that of friction upon the specially\r\n    prepared match, producing that flash of insight which led us\r\n    immediately to the simple but universal law of the \"survival of\r\n    the fittest,\" as the long-sought _effective_ cause of the\r\n    continuous modification and adaptations of living things.\r\n\r\n    It is an unimportant detail that Darwin read this book two years\r\n    _after_ his return from his voyage, while I read it _before_ I\r\n    went abroad, and it was a sudden recollection of its teachings\r\n    that caused the solution to flash upon me. I attach much\r\n    importance, however, to the large amount of solitude we both\r\n    enjoyed during our travels, which, at the most impressionable\r\n    period of our lives, gave us ample time for reflection on the\r\n    phenomena we were daily observing.\r\n\r\n    This view, of the combination of certain mental faculties and\r\n    external conditions that led Darwin and myself to an identical\r\n    conception, also serves to explain why none of our precursors or\r\n    contemporaries hit upon what is really so very simple a solution\r\n    of the great problem. Such evolutionists as Robert Chambers,\r\n    Herbert Spencer, and Huxley, though of great intellect, wide\r\n    knowledge, and immense power of work, had none of them the special\r\n    turn of mind that makes the collector and the species-man; while\r\n    they all--as well as the equally great thinker on similar lines,\r\n    Sir Charles Lyell--became in early life immersed in different\r\n    lines of research which engaged their chief attention.\r\n\r\n    Neither did the actual precursors of Darwin in the statement of\r\n    the principle--Wells, Matthews and Prichard--possess any adequate\r\n    knowledge of the class of facts above referred to, or sufficient\r\n    antecedent interest in the problem itself, which were both needed\r\n    in order to perceive the application of the principle to the mode\r\n    of development of the varied forms of life.\r\n\r\n    And now, to recur to my own position, I may be allowed to make a\r\n    final remark. I have long since come to see that no one deserves\r\n    either praise or blame for the _ideas_ that come to him, but only\r\n    for the actions resulting therefrom. Ideas and beliefs are\r\n    certainly not voluntary acts. They come to us--we hardly know\r\n    _how_ or _whence_, and once they have got possession of us we\r\n    cannot reject or change them at will. It is for the common good\r\n    that the promulgation of ideas should be free--uninfluenced either\r\n    by praise or blame, reward or punishment.\r\n\r\n    But the _actions_ which result from our ideas may properly be so\r\n    treated, because it is only by patient thought and work that new\r\n    ideas, if good and true, become adapted and utilised; while if\r\n    untrue, or if not adequately presented to the world, they are\r\n    rejected or forgotten.\r\n\r\n    I therefore accept the crowning honour you have conferred on me\r\n    to-day, not for the happy chance through which I became an\r\n    independent originator of the doctrine of \"survival of the\r\n    fittest,\" but as a too liberal recognition by you of the moderate\r\n    amount of time and work I have given to explain and elucidate the\r\n    theory, to point out some novel applications of it, and (I hope I\r\n    may add) for my attempts to extend those applications, even in\r\n    directions which somewhat diverged from those accepted by my\r\n    honoured friend and teacher Charles Darwin.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker was now called upon by the President to receive the\r\nDarwin-Wallace Medal. In acknowledging the honour that had been paid\r\nhim, he said:\r\n\r\n    No thesis or subject was vouchsafed to me by the Council, but,\r\n    having gratefully accepted the honour, I was bound to find one for\r\n    myself. It soon dawned upon me that the object sought by my\r\n    selection might have been that, considering the intimate terms\r\n    upon which Mr. Darwin extended to me his friendship, I could from\r\n    my memory contribute to the knowledge of some important events in\r\n    his career. It having been intimated to me that this was in a\r\n    measure true, I have selected as such an event one germane to this\r\n    Celebration and also engraven on my memory, namely, the\r\n    considerations which determined Mr. Darwin to assent to the course\r\n    which Sir Charles Lyell and myself had suggested to him, that of\r\n    presenting to the Society, in one communication, his own and Mr.\r\n    Wallace's theories on the effect of variation and the struggle for\r\n    existence on the evolution of species.\r\n\r\n    You have all read Francis Darwin's fascinating work as editor of\r\n    his father's \"Life and Letters,\" where you will find (Vol. II., p.\r\n    116) a letter addressed, on the 18th of June, 1858, to Sir Charles\r\n    Lyell by Mr. Darwin, who states that he had on that day received a\r\n    communication from Mr. Wallace written from the Celebes Islands\r\n    requesting that it might be sent to him (Sir Charles).\r\n\r\n    In a covering letter Mr. Darwin pointed out that the enclosure\r\n    contained a sketch of a theory of Natural Selection as depending\r\n    on the struggle for existence so identical with one he himself\r\n    entertained and fully described in MS. in 1842 that he never saw a\r\n    more striking coincidence: had Mr. Wallace seen his sketch he\r\n    could not have made a better short abstract, even his terms\r\n    standing \"as heads of chapters.\" He goes on to say that he would\r\n    at once write to Mr. Wallace offering to send his MS. to any\r\n    journal; and concludes: \"So my originality is smashed, though my\r\n    book [the forthcoming 'Origin of Species'], if it will have any\r\n    value will not be deteriorated, as all know the labour consists in\r\n    the application of the theory.\"\r\n\r\n    After writing to Sir Charles Lyell, Mr. Darwin informed me of Mr.\r\n    Wallace's letter and its enclosure, in a similar strain, only more\r\n    explicitly announcing his resolve to abandon all claim to priority\r\n    for his own sketch. I could not but protest against such a course,\r\n    no doubt reminding him that I had read it and that Sir Charles\r\n    knew its contents some years before the arrival of Mr. Wallace's\r\n    letter; and that our withholding our knowledge of its priority\r\n    would be unjustifiable. I further suggested the simultaneous\r\n    publication of the two, and offered--should he agree to such a\r\n    compromise--to write to Mr. Wallace fully informing him of the\r\n    motives of the course adopted.\r\n\r\n    In answer Mr. Darwin thanked me warmly for my offer to explain all\r\n    to Mr. Wallace, and in a later letter he informed me that he was\r\n    disposed to look favourably on my suggested compromise, but that\r\n    before making up his mind he desired a second opinion as to\r\n    whether he could honourably claim priority, and that he proposed\r\n    applying to Sir Charles Lyell for this. I need not say that this\r\n    was a relief to me, knowing as I did what Sir Charles's answer\r\n    must be.\r\n\r\n    In Vol. II., pp. 117-18, of the \"Life and Letters,\" Mr. Darwin's\r\n    application to Sir Charles Lyell is given, dated June 26th, with a\r\n    postscript dated June 27th. In it he requests that the answer\r\n    shall be sent to me to be forwarded to himself. I have no\r\n    recollection of reading the answer, which is not to be found\r\n    either in Darwin's or my own correspondence; it was no doubt\r\n    satisfactory.\r\n\r\n    Further action was now left in the hands of Sir Charles and\r\n    myself, we all agreeing that, whatever action was taken, the\r\n    result should be offered for publication to the Linnean Society.\r\n\r\n    On June 29th Mr. Darwin wrote to me in acute distress, being\r\n    himself very ill, and scarlet fever raging in the family, to which\r\n    one infant son had succumbed on the previous day, and a daughter\r\n    was ill with diphtheria. He acknowledged the receipt of the letter\r\n    from me, adding, \"I cannot think now of the subject, but soon\r\n    will: you shall hear as soon as I can think\"; and on the night of\r\n    the same day he writes again, telling me that he is quite\r\n    prostrated and can do nothing but send certain papers for which I\r\n    had asked as essential for completing the prefatory statement to\r\n    the communication to the Linnean Society of Mr. Wallace's\r\n    essay....\r\n\r\n    The communications were read, as was the custom in those days, by\r\n    the Secretary to the Society. Mr. Darwin himself, owing to his\r\n    illness and distress, could not be present. Sir Charles Lyell and\r\n    myself said a few words to emphasise the importance of the\r\n    subject, but, as recorded in the \"Life and Letters\" (Vol. II., p.\r\n    126), although intense interest was excited, no discussion took\r\n    place: \"the subject was too novel, too ominous, for the old school\r\n    to enter the lists before armouring.\" ...\r\n\r\n    It must also be noticed that for the detailed history given above\r\n    there is no documentary evidence beyond what Francis Darwin has\r\n    produced in the \"Life and Letters.\" There are no letters from\r\n    Lyell relating to it, not even answers to Mr. Darwin's of the\r\n    18th, 25th, and 26th of June; and Sir Leonard Lyell has at my\r\n    request very kindly but vainly searched his uncle's correspondence\r\n    for any relating to this subject beyond the two above mentioned.\r\n    There are none of my letters to either Lyell or Darwin, nor other\r\n    evidence of their having existed beyond the latter's\r\n    acknowledgment of the receipt of some of them; and, most\r\n    surprising of all, Mr. Wallace's letter and its enclosure have\r\n    disappeared. Such is my recollection of this day, the fiftieth\r\n    anniversary of which we are now celebrating, and of the fortnight\r\n    that immediately preceded it.\r\n\r\n    It remains for me to ask your forgiveness for intruding upon your\r\n    time and attention with the half-century-old real or fancied\r\n    memories of a nonagenarian as contributions to the history of the\r\n    most notable event in the annals of Biology that had followed the\r\n    appearance in 1735 of the \"Systema Naturæ\" of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nFollowing Sir J. Hooker, the President, referring to Prof. Haeckel, who\r\nwas unable to be present, said that he was \"the great apostle of the\r\nDarwin-Wallace theory in Germany ... his enthusiastic and gallant\r\nadvocacy [having] chiefly contributed to its success in that country....\r\nA man of world-wide reputation, the leader on the Continent of the 'Old\r\nGuard' of evolutionary biologists, Prof. Haeckel was one whom the\r\nLinnean Society delighted to honour.\" Two more German scientists were\r\nhonoured with the Medal, namely Prof. August Weismann (who was also\r\nabsent), and Prof. Eduard Strasburger, the latter paying a special\r\ntribute to Wallace in saying: \"When I was young the investigations and\r\nthe thought of Alfred Russel Wallace brought me a great stimulus.\r\nThrough his 'Malay Archipelago' a new world of scientific knowledge was\r\nunfolded before me. On this occasion I feel it my duty to proclaim it\r\nwith gratitude.\" The Medal was then presented to Sir Francis Galton, who\r\ndelivered a notable speech in responding. The last on this occasion to\r\nreceive the Medal was Sir E. Ray Lankester, who, in replying to the\r\nPresident's graceful speech, referred to the happy relationships which\r\nhad existed between the contemporary men of science of his own time, but\r\nwith special reference to Darwin and Wallace he said:\r\n\r\n    Never was there a more beautiful example of modesty, of unselfish\r\n    admiration for another's work, of loyal determination that the\r\n    other should receive the full merit of his independent labours and\r\n    thoughts, than was shown by Charles Darwin on that occasion....\r\n\r\n    Subsequently, throughout all their arduous work and varied\r\n    publications upon the great doctrine which they on that day\r\n    unfolded to humanity ... the same complete absence of rivalry\r\n    characterised these high-minded Englishmen, even when in some\r\n    outcomes of their doctrine they were not in perfect agreement....\r\n    I think I am able to say that great as was the interest excited by\r\n    the new doctrine in the scientific world, and wild and angry as\r\n    was the opposition to it in some quarters, few, if any, who took\r\n    part in the scenes attending the birth and earlier reception of\r\n    Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" had a prevision of the enormous and\r\n    all-important influence which that doctrine was destined to\r\n    exercise upon every line of human thought.... It is in its\r\n    application to the problems of human society that there still\r\n    remains an enormous field of work and discovery for the\r\n    Darwin-Wallace doctrine.\r\n\r\n    In the special branch of study which Wallace himself set\r\n    going--the inquiry into the local variations, races, and species\r\n    of insects as evidence of descent with modification, and of the\r\n    mechanism by which that modification is brought about--there is\r\n    still great work in progress, still an abundant field to be\r\n    reaped.... Several able observers and experimenters have set\r\n    themselves the task of improving, if possible, the theoretical\r\n    structure raised by Darwin and Wallace.... But I venture to\r\n    express the opinion that they have none of them resulted in any\r\n    serious modification of the great doctrine submitted to the\r\n    Linnean Society on July 1st, 1858, by Charles Darwin and Alfred\r\n    Russel Wallace. Not only do the main lines of the theory of Darwin\r\n    and Wallace remain unchanged, but the more it is challenged by new\r\n    suggestions and new hypotheses the more brilliantly do the\r\n    novelty, the importance, and the permanent value of the work by\r\n    those great men, to-day commemorated by us, shine forth as the one\r\n    great epoch-making effort of human thought on this subject.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Darwin and Sir William Thiselton-Dyer spoke on behalf of\r\nSchools which had sent representatives to the meeting; Prof. Lönnberg\r\nand Sir Archibald Geikie on behalf of the Academies and Societies; while\r\nLord Avebury delivered the concluding address.\r\n\r\nAny summary of this period in the lives of Darwin and Wallace would be\r\nincomplete without some distinct reference to one other name, namely,\r\nthat of Herbert Spencer, whom I have linked with them in the\r\nIntroduction.\r\n\r\nWhile we owe to Darwin and Wallace a definite theory of organic\r\ndevelopment, it must be remembered that Spencer included this in the\r\ngeneral scheme of Evolution which grew as slowly but surely in his\r\nmind--and as independently as did that of the origin of species in the\r\nminds of Darwin and Wallace. Huxley recalls: \"Within the ranks of\r\nbiologists, at that time, I met with nobody except Dr. Grant, of\r\nUniversity College, who had a word to say for Evolution--and his\r\nadvocacy was not calculated to advance the cause. Outside these ranks,\r\nthe only person known to me whose knowledge and capacity compelled\r\nrespect, and who was, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist,\r\nwas Mr. Herbert Spencer.... Many and prolonged were the battles we\r\nfought on this topic.... I took my stand upon two grounds: first, that\r\nup to that time the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly\r\ninsufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestions respecting the causes\r\nof the transmutations assumed ... were in any war adequate to explain\r\nthe phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I\r\nreally do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable.\"[25]\r\n\r\nAnd Prof. Raphael Meldola, in a lecture on Evolution wherein he compares\r\nthe impression left by each of these great founders of that school upon\r\nthe current of modern thought, says: \"Through all ... his [Spencer's]\r\nwritings the underlying idea of development can be traced with\r\nincreasing depth and breadth, expanding in 1850 in his 'Social Statics'\r\nto a foreshadowing of the general doctrine of Evolution. In 1852 his\r\nviews on organic evolution had become so definite that he gave public\r\nexpression to them in that well-known and powerful essay on 'The\r\nDevelopment Hypothesis.' ... In the 'Principles of Psychology,' the\r\nfirst edition of which was published in 1855, the evolutionary principle\r\nwas dominant. By 1858--the year of the announcement of Natural Selection\r\nby Darwin and Wallace--he had conceived the great general scheme and had\r\nsketched out the first draft of the prospectus of the Synthetic\r\nPhilosophy, the final and amended syllabus [being] issued in 1860. The\r\nwork of Darwin and Spencer from that period, although moving along\r\nindependent lines, was directed towards the same end, notwithstanding\r\nthe diversity of materials which they made use of and the differences in\r\ntheir methods of attack; that end was the establishment of Evolution as\r\na great natural principle or law.\"[26]\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is especially interesting to note how near Spencer\r\nhad come to the conception of Natural Selection without grasping its\r\nfull significance. In an article on a \"Theory of Population\" (published\r\nin the _Westminster Review_ for April, 1852) he wrote: \"And here,\r\nindeed, without further illustration, it will be seen that premature\r\ndeath, under all its forms and from all its causes, cannot fail to work\r\nin the same direction. For as those prematurely carried off must, in the\r\naverage of cases, be those in whom the power of self-preservation is the\r\nleast, it unavoidably follows that those left behind to continue the\r\nrace must be those in whom the power of self-preservation is the\r\ngreatest--must be the select of their generation. So that whether the\r\ndangers of existence be of the kind produced by excess of fertility, or\r\nof any other kind, it is clear that by the ceaseless exercise of the\r\nfaculties needed to contend with them, and by the death of all men who\r\nfail to contend with them successfully, there is ensured a constant\r\nprogress towards a higher degree of skill, intelligence,\r\nself-regulation--a better co-ordinance of actions--a more complete\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nUp to the period of the publication of the \"Origin of Species\" and the\r\nfirst conception of the scheme of the Synthetic Philosophy there had\r\nbeen no communication between Darwin and Spencer beyond the presentation\r\nby Spencer of a copy of his Essays to Darwin in 1858, which was duly\r\nacknowledged. But by the time the \"Origin of Species\" had been before\r\nthe public for eight years, the Darwinian principle of selection had\r\nbecome an integral part of the Spencerian mechanism of organic\r\nevolution. Indeed the term \"survival of the fittest,\" approved by both\r\nDarwin and Wallace as an alternative for \"natural selection,\" was, as is\r\nwell known, introduced by Spencer.\r\n\r\nWallace's relations with Spencer, though somewhat controversial at\r\ntimes, were nevertheless cordial and sympathetic. In \"My Life\" he tells\r\nof his first visit, and the impression left upon his mind by their\r\nconversation. It occurred somewhere about 1862-3, shortly after he and\r\nBates had read, and been greatly impressed by, Spencer's \"First\r\nPrinciples.\" \"Our thoughts,\" he says, \"were full of the great unsolved\r\nproblem of the origin of life--a problem which Darwin's 'Origin of\r\nSpecies' left in as much obscurity as ever--and we looked to Spencer as\r\nthe one man living who could give us some clue to it. His wonderful\r\nexposition of the fundamental laws and conditions, actions and\r\ninteractions of the material universe seemed to penetrate so deeply into\r\nthat 'nature of things' after which the early philosophers searched in\r\nvain ... that we hoped he would throw some light on that great problem\r\nof problems.... He was very pleasant, spoke appreciatively of what we\r\nhad both done for the practical exposition of evolution, and hoped we\r\nwould continue to work at the subject. But when we touched upon the\r\ngreat problem, and whether he had arrived at even one of the first steps\r\ntowards its solution, our hopes were dashed at once. That, he said, was\r\ntoo fundamental a problem to even think of solving at present. We did\r\nnot yet know enough of matter in its essential constitution nor of the\r\nvarious forces of nature; and all he could say was that everything\r\npointed to its having been a development out of matter--a phase of that\r\ncontinuous process of evolution by which the whole universe had been\r\nbrought to its present condition. And so we had to wait and work\r\ncontentedly at minor problems. And now, after forty years, though\r\nSpencer and Darwin and Weismann have thrown floods of light on the\r\nphenomena of life, its essential nature and its origin remain as great a\r\nmystery as ever. Whatever light we do possess is from a source which\r\nSpencer and Darwin neglected or ignored.\"[27]\r\n\r\nIn his presidential address to the Entomological Society in 1872 Wallace\r\nmade some special allusion to Spencer's theory of the origin of\r\ninstincts, and on receiving a copy of the address Spencer wrote: \"It is\r\ngratifying to me to find that your extended knowledge does not lead you\r\nto scepticism respecting the speculation of mine which you quote, but\r\nrather enables you to cite further facts in justification of it.\r\nPossibly your exposition will lead some of those, in whose lines of\r\ninvestigation the question lies, to give deliberate attention to it.\" A\r\nfurther proof of his confidence was shown by asking Wallace (in 1874) to\r\nlook over the proofs of the first six chapters of his \"Principles of\r\nSociology\" in order that he might have the benefit of his criticisms\r\nalike as naturalist, anthropologist, and traveller.\r\n\r\nThis brief reference to the illustrious group of men to whom we owe the\r\nfoundations of this new epoch of evolutionary thought--and not the\r\nfoundations only, but also the patient building up of the structure upon\r\nwhich each one continued to perform his allotted task--and the prefatory\r\nnotes and the footnotes attached to the letters will serve to elucidate\r\nthe historical correspondence between Darwin and Wallace which follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II (_Continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The Complete Extant Correspondence between Wallace and Darwin\r\n\r\n[1857--81]\r\n\r\n    \"I hope it is a satisfaction to you to reflect--and very few\r\n    things in my life have been more satisfactory to me--that we have\r\n    never felt any jealousy towards each other, though in some senses\r\n    rivals. I believe I can say this of myself with truth, and I am\r\n    absolutely sure that it is true of you.\"--DARWIN to Wallace.\r\n\r\n    \"To have thus inspired and retained this friendly feeling,\r\n    notwithstanding our many differences of opinion, I feel to be one\r\n    of the greatest honours of my life.\"--WALLACE to Darwin.\r\n\r\n    \"I think the way he [Wallace] carries on controversy is perfectly\r\n    beautiful, and in future histories of science the Wallace-Darwin\r\n    episode will form one of the few bright points among rival\r\n    claimants.\"--ERASMUS DARWIN to his niece, Henrietta Darwin, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first eight letters from Darwin to Wallace were found amongst the\r\nlatter's papers, carefully preserved in an envelope on the outside of\r\nwhich he had written the words reproduced on the next page. Neither\r\nWallace's part of this correspondence, nor the original MS. of his essay\r\n\"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original\r\nType,\" which he sent to Darwin from Ternate, has been discovered. But\r\nthese eight letters from Darwin explain themselves and reveal the inner\r\nstory of the independent discovery of the theory of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the letters which follow the first eight, both sides of\r\nthe correspondence, with few exceptions, have been brought together.\r\nSome of the letters have already appeared in \"The Life and Letters of\r\nCharles Darwin\" and \"More Letters,\" others in \"My Life,\" by A.R.\r\nWallace, whilst many have not before been published.\r\n\r\nSome of these letters, in themselves, have little more than ephemeral\r\ninterest, and parts of other letters could have been eliminated, from\r\nthe point of view of lightening this volume and of economising the\r\nreader's attention. But I decided, with the fullest approval of the\r\nWallace and Darwin families, that the letters of these illustrious\r\ncorrespondents should be here presented as a whole, without mutilation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF INSCRIPTION BY WALLACE ON THE ENVELOPE IN\r\nWHICH HE KEPT THE FIRST EIGHT LETTERS HE RECEIVED FROM DARWIN.]\r\n\r\nMany of the notes of explanation to the Wallace letters have been\r\ngathered from his own writings, and are mainly in his own words, and in\r\nsuch cases the reader has the advantage of perusing letters annotated by\r\ntheir author, while most of the notes to the Darwin letters are by Sir\r\nF.

WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, May 1, 1857._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--I am much obliged for your letter of Oct. 10th from\r\nCelebes, received a few days ago: in a laborious undertaking, sympathy\r\nis a valuable and real encouragement. By your letter, and even still\r\nmore by your paper in the _Annals_,[28] a year or more ago, I can plainly\r\nsee that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent have come to\r\nsimilar conclusions. In regard to the paper in the _Annals_, I agree to\r\nthe truth of almost every word of your paper; and I daresay that you\r\nwill agree with me that it is very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty\r\nclosely with any theoretical paper; for it is lamentable how each man\r\ndraws his own different conclusions from the very same fact. This summer\r\nwill make the twentieth year (!) since I opened my first note-book on\r\nthe question how and in what way do species and varieties differ from\r\neach other. I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the\r\nsubject so very large, that though I have written many chapters, I do\r\nnot suppose I shall go to press for two years.\r\n\r\nI have never heard how long you intend staying in the Malay Archipelago;\r\nI wish I might profit by the publication of your Travels there before my\r\nwork appears, for no doubt you will reap a large harvest of facts.\r\n\r\nI have acted already in accordance with your advice of keeping domestic\r\nvarieties, and those appearing in a state of nature, distinct; but I\r\nhave sometimes doubted of the wisdom of this, and therefore I am glad to\r\nbe backed by your opinion. I must confess, however, I rather doubt the\r\ntruth of the now very prevalent doctrine of all our domestic animals\r\nhaving descended from several wild stocks; though I do not doubt that it\r\nis so in some cases. I think there is rather better evidence on the\r\nsterility of hybrid animals than you seem to admit: and in regard to\r\nplants, the collection of carefully recorded facts by Kölreuter and\r\nGaertner (and Herbert) is _enormous_. I most entirely agree with you on\r\nthe little effect of \"climatic conditions\" which one sees referred to\r\n_ad nauseam_ in all books: I suppose some very little effect must be\r\nattributed to such influences, but I fully believe that they are very\r\nslight. It is really _impossible_ to explain my views in the compass of\r\na letter as to causes and means of variation in a state of nature; but I\r\nhave slowly adopted a distinct and tangible idea--whether true or false\r\nothers must judge; for the firmest conviction of the truth of a doctrine\r\nby its author seems, alas, not to be the slightest guarantee of truth.\r\n\r\nI have been rather disappointed at my results in the poultry line; but\r\nif you should, after receiving this, stumble on any curious domestic\r\nbreed, I should be very glad to have it; but I can plainly see that the\r\nresult will not be at all worth the trouble which I have taken. The case\r\nis different with the domestic pigeons; from its study I have learned\r\nmuch. The Rajah has sent me some of his pigeons and fowls and _cats'_\r\nskins from the interior of Borneo and from Singapore. Can you tell me\r\npositively that black jaguars or leopards are believed generally or\r\nalways to pair with black? I do not think colour of offspring good\r\nevidence. Is the case of parrots fed on fat of fish turning colour\r\nmentioned in your Travels? I remember a case of parrots with (I think)\r\npoison from some toad put into hollow whence primaries had been removed.\r\n\r\nOne of the subjects on which I have been experimenting, and which cost\r\nme much trouble, is the means of distribution of all organic beings\r\nfound on oceanic islands; and any facts on this subject would be most\r\ngratefully received.\r\n\r\nLand-molluscs are a great perplexity to me. This is a very dull letter,\r\nbut I am a good deal out of health, and am writing this, not from my\r\nhome, as dated, but from a water-cure establishment.\r\n\r\nWith most sincere good wishes for your success in every way, I remain,\r\nmy dear Sir, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER II\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent. December 22, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--I thank you for your letter of Sept. 27th. I am extremely\r\nglad to hear that you are attending to distribution in accordance with\r\ntheoretical ideas. I am a firm believer that without speculation there\r\nis no good and original observation. Few travellers have attended to\r\nsuch points as you are now at work on; and indeed the whole subject of\r\ndistribution of animals is dreadfully behind that of plants. You say\r\nthat you have been somewhat surprised at no notice having been taken of\r\nyour paper in the _Annals_. I cannot say that I am; for so very few\r\nnaturalists care for anything beyond the mere description of species.\r\nBut you must not suppose that your paper has not been attended to: two\r\nvery good men, Sir C. Lyell, and Mr. E. Blyth at Calcutta, specially\r\ncalled my attention to it. Though agreeing with you on your conclusions\r\nin the paper, I believe I go much further than you; but it is too long a\r\nsubject to enter on my speculative notions. I have not yet seen your\r\npaper on distribution of animals in the Aru Islands: I shall read it\r\nwith the _utmost_ interest; for I think that the most interesting\r\nquarter of the whole globe in respect to distribution; and I have long\r\nbeen very imperfectly trying to collect data from the Malay Archipelago.\r\nI shall be quite prepared to subscribe to your doctrine of subsidence:\r\nindeed from the quite independent evidence of the coral reefs I coloured\r\nmy original map in my Coral volumes colours [_sic_] of the Aru Islands\r\nas one of subsidence, but got frightened and left it uncoloured. But I\r\ncan see that you are inclined to go _much_ further than I am in regard\r\nto the former connection of oceanic islands with continents. Ever since\r\npoor E. Forbes propounded this doctrine, it has been eagerly followed;\r\nand Hooker elaborately discusses the former connection of all the\r\nAntarctic islands and New Zealand and South America. About a year ago I\r\ndiscussed the subject much with Lyell and Hooker (for I shall have to\r\ntreat of it) and wrote out my arguments in opposition; but you will be\r\nglad to hear that neither Lyell nor Hooker thought much of my arguments;\r\nnevertheless, for once in my life I dare withstand the almost\r\npreternatural sagacity of Lyell. You ask about land-shells on islands\r\nfar distant from continents: Madeira has a few identical with those of\r\nEurope, and here the evidence is really good, as some of them are\r\nsub-fossil. In the Pacific islands there are cases of identity, which I\r\ncannot at present persuade myself to account for by introduction through\r\nman's agency; although Dr. Aug. Gould has conclusively shown that many\r\nland-shells have thus been distributed over the Pacific by man's agency.\r\nThese cases of introduction are most plaguing. Have you not found it so\r\nin the Malay Archipelago? It has seemed to me, in the lists of mammals\r\nof Timor and other islands, that _several_ in all probability have been\r\nnaturalised.\r\n\r\nSince writing before, I have experimented a little on some\r\nland-molluscs, and have found sea-water not quite so deadly as I\r\nanticipated. You ask whether I shall discuss Man: I think I shall avoid\r\nthe whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully\r\nadmit that it is the highest and most interesting problem for the\r\nnaturalist. My work, on which I have now been at work more or less for\r\ntwenty years, will _not_ fix or settle anything; but I hope it will aid\r\nby giving a large collection of facts with one definite end. I get on\r\nvery slowly, partly from ill-health, partly from being a very slow\r\nworker. I have got about half written; but I do not suppose I shall\r\npublish under a couple of years. I have now been three whole months on\r\none chapter on hybridism!\r\n\r\nI am astonished to see that you expect to remain out three or four years\r\nmore: what a wonderful deal you will have seen; and what an interesting\r\narea, the grand Malay Archipelago and the richest parts of South\r\nAmerica! I infinitely admire and honour your zeal and courage in the\r\ngood cause of natural science; and you have my very sincere and cordial\r\ngood wishes for success of all kinds; and may all your theories succeed,\r\nexcept that on oceanic islands, on which subject I will do battle to the\r\ndeath.--Pray believe me, my dear Sir, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER III\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent. January 25, 1859._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--I was extremely much pleased at receiving three days ago\r\nyour letter to me and that to Dr. Hooker. Permit me to say how heartily\r\nI admire the spirit in which they are written. Though I had absolutely\r\nnothing whatever to do in leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought\r\na fair course of action, yet I naturally could not but feel anxious to\r\nhear what your impression would be. I owe indirectly much to you and\r\nthem; for I almost think that Lyell would have proved right and I should\r\nnever have completed my larger work, for I have found my abstract[29]\r\nhard enough with my poor health; but now, thank God, I am in my last\r\nchapter but one. My abstract will make a small volume of 400 or 500\r\npages. Whenever published, I will of course send you a copy, and then\r\nyou will see what I mean about the part which I believe selection has\r\nplayed with domestic productions. It is a very different part, as you\r\nsuppose, from that played by \"natural selection.\"\r\n\r\nI sent off, by same address as this note, a copy of the _Journal of the\r\nLinnean Society_, and subsequently I have sent some half-dozen copies of\r\nthe Paper. I have many other copies at your disposal; and I sent two to\r\nyour friend Dr. Davies (?), author of works on men's skulls.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you have been attending to birds' nests; I have\r\ndone so, though almost exclusively under one point of view, viz. to show\r\nthat instincts vary, so that selection could work on and improve them.\r\nFew other instincts, so to speak, can be preserved in a museum.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your offer to look after horses' stripes; if there are\r\nany donkeys', pray add them.\r\n\r\nI am delighted to hear that you have collected bees' combs; when next in\r\nLondon I will inquire of F. Smith and Mr. Saunders. This is an especial\r\nhobby of mine, and I think I can throw light on the subject. If you can\r\ncollect duplicates at no very great expense, I should be glad of\r\nspecimens for myself, with some bees of each kind. Young growing and\r\nirregular combs, and those which have not had pupæ, are most valuable\r\nfor measurements and examination; their edges should be well protected\r\nagainst abrasion.\r\n\r\nEveryone whom I have seen has thought your paper very well written and\r\ninteresting. It puts my extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years\r\nago!), which I must say in apology were never for an instant intended\r\nfor publication, in the shade.\r\n\r\nYou ask about Lyell's frame of mind. I think he is somewhat staggered,\r\nbut does not give in, and speaks with horror often to me of what a thing\r\nit would be and what a job it would be for the next edition of the\r\nPrinciples if he were \"perverted.\" But he is most candid and honest, and\r\nI think will end by being perverted. Dr. Hooker has become almost as\r\nheterodox as you or I--and I look at Hooker as _by far_ the most capable\r\njudge in Europe.\r\n\r\nMost cordially do I wish you health and entire success in all your\r\npursuits; and God knows, if admirable zeal and energy deserve success,\r\nmost amply do you deserve it. I look at my own career as nearly run out;\r\nif I can publish my abstract, and perhaps my greater work on the same\r\nsubject, I shall look at my course as done.--Believe me, my dear Sir,\r\nyours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER IV\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent. April 6, 1859._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,--I this morning received your pleasant and friendly\r\nnote of Nov. 30th. The first part of my MS.[30] is in Murray's hands, to\r\nsee if he likes to publish it. There is no Preface, but a short\r\nIntroduction, which must be read by everyone who reads my book. The\r\nsecond paragraph in the Introduction[31] I have had copied _verbatim_\r\nfrom my foul copy, and you will, I hope, think that I have fairly\r\nnoticed your papers in the _Linnean Transactions_.[32] You must remember\r\nthat I am now publishing only an Abstract, and I give no references. I\r\nshall of course allude to your paper on Distribution;[33] and I have\r\nadded that I know from correspondence that your explanation of your law\r\nis the same as that which I offer. You are right, that I came to the\r\nconclusion that Selection was the principle of change from study of\r\ndomesticated productions; and then reading Malthus I saw at once how to\r\napply this principle. Geographical distribution and geographical\r\nrelations of extinct to recent inhabitants of South America first led me\r\nto the subject. Especially the case of the Galapagos Islands.\r\n\r\nI hope to go to press in early part of next month. It will be a small\r\nvolume of about 500 pages or so. I will, of course, send you a copy.\r\n\r\nI forget whether I told you that Hooker, who is our best British\r\nbotanist, and perhaps the best in the world, is a _full_ convert, and is\r\nnow going immediately to publish his confession of faith; and I expect\r\ndaily to see the proof-sheets. Huxley is changed and believes in\r\nmutation of species: whether a _convert_ to us, I do not quite know. We\r\nshall live to see all the _younger_ men converts. My neighbour and\r\nexcellent naturalist, J. Lubbock, is an enthusiastic convert. I see by\r\nNatural History notices that you are doing great work in the\r\nArchipelago; and most heartily do I sympathise with you. For God's sake\r\ntake care of your health. There have been few such noble labourers in\r\nthe cause of natural science as you are. Farewell, with every good\r\nwish.--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You cannot tell how I admire your spirit, in the manner in which\r\nyou have taken all that was done about publishing our papers. I had\r\nactually written a letter to you, stating that I would _not_ publish\r\nanything before you had published. I had not sent that letter to the\r\npost when I received one from Lyell and Hooker, _urging_ me to send some\r\nMS. to them, and allow them to act as they thought fair and honourably\r\nto both of us. I did so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER V\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent. August 9, 1859._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,--I received your letter and memoir[34] on the 7th,\r\nand will forward it to-morrow to the Linnean Society. But you will be\r\naware that there is no meeting till beginning of November. Your paper\r\nseems to me _admirable_ in matter, style and reasoning; and I thank you\r\nfor allowing me to read it. Had I read it some months ago I should have\r\nprofited by it for my forthcoming volume. But my two chapters on this\r\nsubject are in type; and though not yet corrected, I am so wearied out\r\nand weak in health that I am fully resolved not to add one word, and\r\nmerely improve style. So you will see that my views are nearly the same\r\nwith yours, and you may rely on it that not one word shall be altered\r\nowing to my having read your ideas. Are you aware that Mr. W. Earl\r\npublished several years ago the view of distribution of animals in the\r\nMalay Archipelago in relation to the depth of the sea between the\r\nislands? I was much struck with this, and have been in habit of noting\r\nall facts on distribution in the Archipelago and elsewhere in this\r\nrelation. I have been led to conclude that there has been a good deal of\r\nnaturalisation in the different Malay islands, and which I have thought\r\nto certain extent would account for anomalies. Timor has been my\r\ngreatest puzzle. What do you say to the peculiar _Felis_ there? I wish\r\nthat you had visited Timor: it has been asserted that a fossil mastodon\r\nor elephant's tooth (I forget which) had been found there, which would\r\nbe a grand fact. I was aware that Celebes was very peculiar; but the\r\nrelation to Africa is quite new to me and marvellous, and almost passes\r\nbelief. It is as anomalous as the relation of plants in South-West\r\nAustralia to the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nI differ _wholly_ from you on colonisation of _oceanic_ islands, but you\r\nwill have _everyone_ else on your side. I quite agree with respect to\r\nall islands not situated far in ocean. I quite agree on little\r\noccasional internavigation between lands when once pretty well stocked\r\nwith inhabitants, but think this does not apply to rising and\r\nill-stocked islands.\r\n\r\nAre you aware that _annually_ birds are blown to Madeira, to Azores (and\r\nto Bermuda from America). I wish I had given fuller abstract of my\r\nreasons for not believing in Forbes's great continental extensions; but\r\nit is too late, for I will alter nothing. I am worn out, and must have\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nOwen, I do not doubt, will bitterly oppose us; but I regard that very\r\nlittle, as he is a poor reasoner and deeply considers the good opinion\r\nof the world, especially the aristocratic world.\r\n\r\nHooker is publishing a grand Introduction to the Flora of Australia, and\r\ngoes the whole length. I have seen proofs of about half.--With every\r\ngood wish, believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nExcuse this brief note, but I am far from well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER VI\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ilkley. November 13, 1859._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--I have told Murray to send you by post (if possible) a\r\ncopy of my book, and I hope that you will receive it at nearly the same\r\ntime with this note. (N.B.--I have got a bad finger, which makes me\r\nwrite extra badly.) If you are so inclined, I should very much like to\r\nhear your general impression of the book, as you have thought so\r\nprofoundly on the subject and in so nearly the same channel with myself.\r\nI hope there will be some little new to you, but I fear not much.\r\nRemember, it is only an abstract, and very much condensed. God knows\r\nwhat the public will think. No one has read it, except Lyell, with whom\r\nI have had much correspondence. Hooker thinks him a complete convert,\r\nbut he does not seem so in his letters to me. But he is evidently deeply\r\ninterested in the subject. I do not think your share in the theory will\r\nbe overlooked by the real judges, as Hooker, Lyell, Asa Gray, etc.\r\n\r\nI have heard from Mr. Sclater that your paper on the Malay Archipelago\r\nhas been read at the Linnean Society, and that he was _extremely_ much\r\ninterested by it.\r\n\r\nI have not seen one naturalist for six or nine months owing to the state\r\nof my health, and therefore I really have no news to tell you. I am\r\nwriting this at Ilkley Wells, where I have been with my family for the\r\nlast six weeks, and shall stay for some few weeks longer. As yet I have\r\nprofited very little. God knows when I shall have strength for my bigger\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that you keep your health: I suppose that you will be\r\nthinking of returning soon with your magnificent collection and still\r\ngrander mental materials. You will be puzzled how to publish. The Royal\r\nSociety Fund will be worth your consideration.--With every good wish,\r\npray believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI think that I told you before that Hooker is a complete convert. If I\r\ncan convert Huxley I shall be content.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER VII\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. March 7, 1860._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--The addresses which you have sent me are capital,\r\nespecially that to the Rajah; and I have dispatched two sets of queries.\r\nI now enclose a copy to you, and should be very glad of any answers; you\r\nmust not suppose the P.S. about memory has lately been inserted; please\r\nreturn these queries, as it is my standard copy. The subject is a\r\ncurious one; I fancy I shall make a rather interesting appendix to my\r\nEssay on Man.\r\n\r\nI fully admit the probability of \"protective adaptation\" having come\r\ninto play with female butterflies as well as with female birds. I have a\r\ngood many facts which make me believe in sexual selection as applied to\r\nman, but whether I shall convince anyone else is very doubtful.--Dear\r\nWallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent. May 18, 1860._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,--I received this morning your letter from Amboyna\r\ndated Feb. 16th, containing some remarks and your too high approbation\r\nof my book. Your letter has pleased me very much, and I most completely\r\nagree with you on the parts which are strongest and which are weakest.\r\nThe imperfection of the geological record is, as you say, the weakest of\r\nall; but yet I am pleased to find that there are almost more geological\r\nconverts than of pursuers of other branches of natural science. I may\r\nmention Lyell, Ramsay, Jukes, Rogers, Keyerling, all good men and true.\r\nPictet of Geneva is not a convert, but is evidently staggered (as I\r\nthink is Bronn of Heidelberg), and he has written a perfectly fair\r\nreview in the _Bib. Universelle_ of Geneva. Old Bronn has translated my\r\nbook, well done also into German, and his well-known name will give it\r\ncirculation. I think geologists are more converted than simple\r\nnaturalists because more accustomed to reasoning.\r\n\r\nBefore telling you about the progress of opinion on the subject, you\r\nmust let me say how I admire the generous manner in which you speak of\r\nmy book: most persons would in your position have felt bitter envy and\r\njealousy. How nobly free you seem to be of this common failing of\r\nmankind. But you speak far too modestly of yourself; you would, if you\r\nhad had my leisure, have done the work just as well, perhaps better,\r\nthan I have done it. Talking of envy, you never read anything more\r\nenvious and spiteful (with numerous misrepresentations) than Owen is in\r\nthe _Edinburgh Review_. I must give one instance; he throws doubts and\r\nsneers at my saying that the ovigerous frena of cirripedes have been\r\nconverted into branchiæ, because I have not found them to be branchiæ;\r\nwhereas _he himself_ admits, before I wrote on cirripedes, without the\r\nleast hesitation, that their organs are branchiæ. The attacks have been\r\nheavy and incessant of late. Sedgwick and Prof. Clarke attacked me\r\nsavagely at the Cambridge Philosophical Society, but Henslow defended me\r\nwell, though not a convert. Phillips has since attacked me in a lecture\r\nat Cambridge; Sir W. Jardine in the _Edinburgh New Philosophical\r\nJournal_, Wollaston in the _Annals of Nat. History_, A. Murray before\r\nthe Royal Soc. of Edinburgh, Haughton at the Geological Society of\r\nDublin, Dawson in the _Canadian Nat. Magazine_, and _many others_. But I\r\nam getting case-hardened, and all these attacks will make me only more\r\ndeterminedly fight. Agassiz sends me personal civil messages, but\r\nincessantly attacks me; but Asa Gray fights like a hero in defence.\r\nLyell keeps as firm as a tower, and this autumn will publish on the\r\nGeological History of Man, and will then declare his conversion, which\r\nnow is universally known. I hope that you have received Hooker's\r\nsplendid essay. So far is bigotry carried that I can name three\r\nbotanists who will not even read Hooker's essay!! Here is a curious\r\nthing: a Mr. Pat. Matthews, a Scotchman, published in 1830 a work on\r\nNaval Timber and Arboriculture, and in the appendix to this he gives\r\n_most clearly_ but very briefly in half-dozen paragraphs our view of\r\nNatural Selection. It is a most complete case of anticipation. He\r\npublished extracts in the _Gardeners' Chronicle_. I got the book, and\r\nhave since published a letter acknowledging that I am fairly\r\nforestalled. Yesterday I heard from Lyell that a German, Dr.\r\nSchaffhausen, has sent him a pamphlet published some years ago, in\r\nwhich the same view is nearly anticipated, but I have not yet seen this\r\npamphlet. My brother, who is a very sagacious man, always said, \"You\r\nwill find that someone will have been before you.\" I am at work at my\r\nlarger work, which I shall publish in separate volumes. But for\r\nill-health and swarms of letters I get on very, very slowly. I hope that\r\nI shall not have wearied you with these details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.R. WALLACE SOON AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE EAST]\r\n\r\nWith sincere thanks for your letter, and with most deeply-felt wishes\r\nfor your success in science and in every way, believe me your sincere\r\nwell-wisher,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the letters from Wallace to Darwin which have been preserved, the\r\nearliest is the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. April 7, 1862._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Darwin,--I was much pleased to receive your note this\r\nmorning. I have not yet begun work, but hope to be soon busy. As I am\r\nbeing doctored a little I do not think I shall be able to accept your\r\nkind invitation at present, but trust to be able to do so during the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nI beg you to accept a wild honeycomb from the island of Timor, not quite\r\nperfect but the best I could get. It is of a small size, but of\r\ncharacteristic form, and I think will be interesting to you. I was quite\r\nunable to get the honey out of it, so fear you will find it somewhat in\r\na mess; but no doubt you will know how to clean it. I have told Stevens\r\nto send it to you.\r\n\r\nHoping your health is now quite restored and with best wishes, I remain,\r\nmy dear Mr. Darwin, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. May 23, 1862._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Darwin,--Many thanks for your most interesting book on the\r\nOrchids. I have read it through most attentively, and have really been\r\nquite as much staggered by the wonderful adaptations you show to exist\r\nin them as by the _Eye_ in animals or any other complicated organs. I\r\nlong to get into the country and have a look at some orchids guided by\r\nyour new lights, but I have been now for ten days confined to my room\r\nwith what is disagreeable though far from dangerous--boils.\r\n\r\nI have been reading several of the Reviews on the \"Origin,\" and it seems\r\nto me that you have assisted those who want to criticise you by your\r\noverstating the difficulties and objections. Several of them quote your\r\nown words as the strongest arguments against you.\r\n\r\nI think you told me Owen wrote the article in the _Quarterly_. This\r\nseems to me hardly credible, as he speaks so much of Owen, quotes him as\r\nsuch a great authority, and I believe even calls him a profound\r\nphilosopher, etc. etc. Would Owen thus speak of himself?\r\n\r\nTrusting your health is good, I remain, my dear Mr. Darwin, yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. May 24, 1862._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,--I write one line to thank you for your note and to\r\nsay that the Bishop of Oxford[35] wrote the _Quarterly Review_ (paid\r\n£60), aided by Owen. In the _Edinburgh_ Owen no doubt praised himself.\r\nMr. Maw's Review in the _Zoologist_ is one of the best, and staggered me\r\nin parts, for I did not see the sophistry of parts. I could lend you any\r\nwhich you might wish to see; but you would soon be tired. Hopkins and\r\nPictet in France are two of the best.\r\n\r\nI am glad you approve of my little Orchid book; but it has not been\r\nworth, I fear, the ten months it has cost me: it was a hobby-horse, and\r\nso beguiled me.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear that you are suffering from boils; I have often had\r\nfearful crops: I hope that the doctors are right in saying that they are\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\nHow puzzled you must be to know what to begin at. You will do grand\r\nwork, I do not doubt.\r\n\r\nMy health is, and always will be, very poor: I am that miserable animal\r\na regular valetudinarian.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. August 8, 1862._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Darwin,--I sincerely trust that your little boy is by this\r\ntime convalescent, and that you are therefore enabled to follow your\r\nfavourite investigations with a more tranquil mind.\r\n\r\nI heard a remark the other day which may not perhaps be new to you, but\r\nseemed to me a fact, if true, in your favour. Mr. Ward (I think it was),\r\na member of the Microscopical Society, mentioned as a fact noticed by\r\nhimself with much surprise that \"the muscular fibres of the whale were\r\nno larger than those of the bee!\"--an excellent indication of community\r\nof origin.\r\n\r\nWhile looking at the ostriches the other day at the Gardens, it occurred\r\nto me that they were a case of special difficulty, as, inhabiting an\r\nancient continent, surrounded by numerous enemies, how did their wings\r\never become abortive, and if they did so before the birds had attained\r\ntheir present gigantic size, strength and speed, how could they in the\r\ntransition have maintained their existence? I see Westwood in the\r\n_Annals_ brings forward the same case, arguing that the ostriches should\r\nhave acquired better wings within the historic period; but as they are\r\nnow the swiftest of animals they evidently do not want their wings,\r\nwhich in their present state may serve some other trifling purpose in\r\ntheir economy such as fans, or balancers, which may have prevented their\r\nbeing reduced to such rudiments as in the cassowaries. The difficulty\r\nto me seems to be, how, if they once had flight, could they have lost\r\nit, surrounded by swift and powerful carnivora against whom it must have\r\nbeen the only defence?\r\n\r\nThis probably is all clear to you, but I think it is a point you might\r\ntouch upon, as I think the objection will seem a strong one to most\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn a day or two I go to Devonshire for a few weeks and hope to lay in a\r\nstock of health to enable me to stick to work at my collections during\r\nthe winter. I begin to find that large collections involve a heavy\r\namount of manual labour which is not very agreeable.\r\n\r\nPresent my compliments to Mrs. and Miss Darwin, and believe me yours\r\nvery faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_1 Carlton Terrace, Southampton. August 20, 1862._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,--You will not be surprised that I have been slow in\r\nanswering when I tell you that my poor boy[36] became frightfully worse\r\nafter you were at Down; and that during our journey to Bournemouth he\r\nhad a slight relapse here and my wife took the scarlet fever rather\r\nseverely. She is over the crisis. I have had a horrid time of it, and\r\nGod only knows when we shall be all safe at home again--half my family\r\nare at Bournemouth.\r\n\r\nI have given a piece of the comb from Timor to a Mr. Woodbury (who is\r\nworking at the subject), and he is _extremely_ interested by it (I was\r\nsure the specimen would be valuable) and has requested me to ascertain\r\nwhether the bee (_A. testacea_) is domesticated when it makes its combs.\r\nWill you kindly inform me?\r\n\r\nYour remarks on ostriches have interested me, and I have alluded to the\r\ncase in the Third Edition. The difficulty does not seem to me so great\r\nas to you. Think of bustards, which inhabit wide open plains, and which\r\nso seldom take flight: a very little increase in size of body would make\r\nthem incapable of flight. The idea of ostriches acquiring flight is\r\nworthy of Westwood; think of the food required in these inhabitants of\r\nthe desert to work the pectoral muscles! In the rhea the wings seem of\r\nconsiderable service in the first start and in turning.[37] ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. September 30, 1862._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Darwin,--Many thanks for the third edition of the \"Origin,\"\r\nwhich I found here on my return from Devonshire on Saturday. I have not\r\nhad time yet to read more than the Historical Sketch, which is very\r\ninteresting, and shows that the time had quite come for your book.\r\n\r\nI am now reading Herbert Spencer's \"First Principles,\" which seems to me\r\na truly great work, which goes to the root of everything.\r\n\r\nI hope you will be well enough to come to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nI remain, my dear Mr. Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. January 14 [1863?]._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Darwin,--I am very sorry indeed to hear you are still in\r\nweak health. Have you ever tried mountain air? A residence at 2,000 or\r\n3,000 ft. elevation is very invigorating.\r\n\r\nI trust your family are now all in good health, and that you may be\r\nspared any anxiety on that score for some time. If you come to town I\r\nshall hope to have the pleasure of seeing you.\r\n\r\nI am now in much better health, but find sudden changes of weather\r\naffect me very much, bringing on ague and fever fits. I am now working a\r\nlittle, but having fresh collections still arriving from correspondents\r\nin the East, it is principally the drudgery of cleaning, packing, and\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page I give all the information I can about the Timor\r\nfossils, so that you can send it entire to Dr. Falconer.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes for the speedy recovery of your health, I remain, my\r\ndear Mr. Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. January 1, 1864._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,--I am still unable to write otherwise than by dictation.\r\nIn a letter received two or three weeks ago from Asa Gray he writes: \"I\r\nread lately with gusto Wallace's exposé of the Dublin man on Bee cells,\r\netc.\"[38]\r\n\r\nNow though I cannot read at present, I much want to know where this is\r\npublished, that I may procure a copy. Further on Asa Gray says (after\r\nspeaking of Agassiz's paper on Glaciers in the _Atlantic Magazine_ and\r\nhis recent book entitled \"Method of Study\"): \"Pray set Wallace upon\r\nthese articles.\" So Asa Gray seems to think much of your powers of\r\nreviewing, and I mention this as it assuredly is _laudari a laudato_.\r\n\r\nI hope you are hard at work, and if you are inclined to tell me I should\r\nmuch like to know what you are doing.\r\n\r\nIt will be many months, I fear, before I shall do anything.\r\n\r\nPray believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. January 2, 1864._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--Many thanks for your kind letter. I was afraid to write\r\nbecause I heard such sad accounts of your health, but I am glad to find\r\nthat you can write, and I presume read, by deputy. My little article on\r\nHaughton's paper was published in the _Annals of Natural History_ about\r\nAugust or September last, I think, but I have not a copy to refer to. I\r\nam sure it does not deserve Asa Gray's praises, for though the matter\r\nmay be true enough, the manner I know is very inferior. It was written\r\nhastily, and when I read it in the _Annals_ I was rather ashamed of it,\r\nas I knew so many could have done it so much better.\r\n\r\nI will try and see Agassiz's paper and book. What I have hitherto seen\r\nof his on Glacial subjects seems very good, but in all his Natural\r\nHistory _theories_, he seems so utterly wrong and so totally blind to\r\nthe plainest deduction from facts, and at the same time so vague and\r\nobscure in his language, that it would be a very long and wearisome task\r\nto answer him.\r\n\r\nWith regard to work, I am doing but little--I am afraid I have no good\r\nhabit of systematic work. I have been gradually getting parts of my\r\ncollections in order, but the obscurities of synonymy and descriptions,\r\nthe difficulty of examining specimens, and my very limited library, make\r\nit wearisome work.\r\n\r\nI have been lately getting the first groups of my butterflies in order,\r\nand they offer some most interesting facts in variation and\r\ndistribution--in variation some very puzzling ones. Though I have very\r\nfine series of specimens, I find in many cases I want more; in fact if I\r\ncould have afforded to have all my collections kept till my return I\r\nshould, I think, have found it necessary to retain twice as many as I\r\nnow have.\r\n\r\nI am at last making a beginning of a small book on my Eastern journey,\r\nwhich, if I can persevere, I hope to have ready by next Christmas. I am\r\na very bad hand at writing anything like narrative. I want something to\r\nargue on, and then I find it much easier to go ahead. I rather despair,\r\ntherefore, of making so good a book as Bates's, though I think my\r\nsubject is better. Like every other traveller, I suppose, I feel\r\ndreadfully the want of copious notes on common everyday objects, sights\r\nand sounds and incidents, which I imagined I could never forget but\r\nwhich I now find it impossible to recall with any accuracy.\r\n\r\nI have just had a long and most interesting letter from my old companion\r\nSpruce. He says he has had a letter from you about Melastoma, but has\r\nnot, he says, for three years seen a single melastomaceous plant! They\r\nare totally absent from the Pacific plains of tropical America, though\r\nso abundant on the Eastern plains. Poor fellow, he seems to be in a\r\nworse state than you are. Life has been a burden to him for three years\r\nowing to lung and heart disease, and rheumatism, brought on by exposure\r\nin high, hot, and cold damp valleys of the Andes. He went down to the\r\ndry climate of the Pacific coast to die more at ease, but the change\r\nimproved him, and he thinks to come home, though he is sure he will not\r\nsurvive the first winter in England. He had never been able to get a\r\ncopy of your book, though I am sure no one would have enjoyed or\r\nappreciated it more.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to bear reading, will you allow me to take the liberty\r\nof recommending you a book? The fact is I have been so astonished and\r\ndelighted with the perusal of Spencer's works that I think it a duty to\r\nsociety to recommend them to all my friends who I think can appreciate\r\nthem. The one I particularly refer to now is \"Social Statics,\" a book\r\nwhich is by no means hard to read; it is even amusing, and owing to the\r\nwonderful clearness of its style may be read and understood by anyone. I\r\nthink, therefore, as it is quite distinct from your special studies at\r\npresent, you might consider it as \"light literature,\" and I am pretty\r\nsure it would interest you more than a great deal of what is now\r\nconsidered very good. I am utterly astonished that so few people seem to\r\nread Spencer, and the utter ignorance there seems to be among\r\npoliticians and political economists of the grand views and logical\r\nstability of his works. He appears to me as far ahead of John Stuart\r\nMill as J.S.M. is of the rest of the world, and, I may add, as Darwin is\r\nof Agassiz. The range of his knowledge is no less than its accuracy. His\r\nnebular hypothesis in the last volume of his essays is the most masterly\r\nastronomical paper I have ever read, and in his forthcoming volume on\r\nBiology he is I understand going to show that there is something else\r\nbesides Natural Selection at work in nature. So you must look out for a\r\n\"foeman worthy of your steel\"! But perhaps all this time you have read\r\nhis books. If so, excuse me, and pray give me your opinion of him, as I\r\nhave hitherto only met with one man (Huxley) who has read and\r\nappreciated him.\r\n\r\nAllow me to say in conclusion how much I regret that unavoidable\r\ncircumstances have caused me to see so little of you since my return\r\nhome, and how earnestly I pray for the speedy restoration of your\r\nhealth.--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Malvern Wells. Tuesday, March, 1864._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,--Your kindness is neverfailing. I got worse and\r\nworse at home and was sick every day for two months; so came here, when\r\nI suddenly broke down and could do nothing; but I hope I am now very\r\nslowly recovering, but am very weak.\r\n\r\nSincere thanks about Melastoma: these flowers have baffled me, and I\r\nhave caused several friends much useless labour; though, Heaven knows, I\r\nhave thrown away time enough on them myself.\r\n\r\nThe gorse case is very valuable, and I will quote it, as I presume I\r\nmay.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to see in the _Reader_ that you have been giving a\r\ngrand paper (as I infer from remarks in discussion) on Geographical\r\nDistribution.\r\n\r\nI am very weak, so will say no more.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Vol. I., p. 93, of the \"Life and Letters of Charles Darwin,\" Darwin\r\nstates the circumstances which led to his writing the \"Descent of Man.\"\r\nHe says that his collection of facts, begun in 1837 or 1838, was\r\ncontinued for many years without any definite idea of publishing on the\r\nsubject. The letter to Wallace of May 28, 1864, in reply to the latter's\r\nof May 10, shows that in the period of ill-health and depression about\r\n1864 he despaired of ever being able to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. May 10, 1864._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I was very much gratified to hear by your letter of a\r\nmonth back that you were a little better, and I have since heard\r\noccasionally through Huxley and Lubbock that you are not worse. I\r\nsincerely hope the summer weather and repose may do you real good.\r\n\r\nThe Borneo Cave exploration is to go on at present without a\r\nsubscription. The new British consul who is going out to Sarawak this\r\nmonth will undertake to explore some of the caves nearest the town, and\r\nif anything of interest is obtained a good large sum can no doubt be\r\nraised for a thorough exploration of the whole country. Sir J. Brooke\r\nwill give every assistance, and will supply men for the preliminary\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI send you now my little contribution to the _theory_ of the origin of\r\nman. I hope you will be able to agree with me. If you are able, I shall\r\nbe glad to have your criticisms.\r\n\r\nI was led to the subject by the necessity of explaining the vast mental\r\nand cranial differences between man and the apes combined with such\r\nsmall structural differences in other parts of the body, and also by an\r\nendeavour to account for the diversity of human races combined with\r\nman's almost perfect stability of form during all historical epochs.\r\n\r\nIt has given me a settled opinion on these subjects, if nobody can show\r\na fallacy in the argument.\r\n\r\nThe Anthropologicals did not seem to appreciate it much, but we had a\r\nlong discussion which appears almost verbatim in the _Anthropological\r\nReview_.[39]\r\n\r\nAs the _Linnean Transactions_ will not be out till the end of the year I\r\nsent a pretty full abstract of the more interesting parts of my\r\nPapilionidæ paper[40] to the _Reader_, which, as you say, is a splendid\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nTrusting Mrs. Darwin and all your family are well, and that you are\r\nimproving, believe me yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent. May 28, 1864._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,--I am so much better that I have just finished a paper for\r\nthe Linnean Society; but as I am not yet at all strong I felt much\r\ndisinclination to write, and therefore you must forgive me for not\r\nhaving sooner thanked you for your paper on Man received on the 11th.\r\nBut first let me say that I have hardly ever in my life been more struck\r\nby any paper than that on variation, etc. etc., in the _Reader_. I feel\r\nsure that such papers will do more for the spreading of our views on the\r\nmodification of species than any separate treatises on the single\r\nsubject itself. It is really admirable; but you ought not in the Man\r\npaper to speak of the theory as mine; it is just as much yours as mine.\r\nOne correspondent has already noticed to me your \"high-minded\" conduct\r\non this head.\r\n\r\nBut now for your Man paper, about which I should like to write more than\r\nI can. The great leading idea is quite new to me, viz. that during late\r\nages the mind will have been modified more than the body; yet I had got\r\nas far as to see with you that the struggle between the races of man\r\ndepended entirely on intellectual and _moral_ qualities. The latter part\r\nof the paper I can designate only as grand and most eloquently done. I\r\nhave shown your paper to two or three persons who have been here, and\r\nthey have been equally struck with it.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that I go with you on all minor points. When reading Sir\r\nG. Grey's account of the constant battles of Australian savages, I\r\nremember thinking that Natural Selection would come in, and likewise\r\nwith the Esquimaux, with whom the art of fishing and managing canoes is\r\nsaid to be hereditary. I rather differ on the rank under the\r\nclassificatory point of view which you assign to Man: I do not think any\r\ncharacter simply in excess ought ever to be used for the higher\r\ndivision. Ants would not be separated from other hymenopterous insects,\r\nhowever high the instinct of the one and however low the instincts of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the differences of race, a conjecture has occurred to me\r\nthat much may be due to the correlation of complexion (and consequently\r\nhair) with constitution. Assume that a dusky individual best escaped\r\nmiasma and you will readily see what I mean. I persuaded the\r\nDirector-General of the Medical Department of the Army to send printed\r\nforms to the surgeons of all regiments in tropical countries to\r\nascertain this point, but I daresay I shall never get any returns.\r\nSecondly, I suspect that a sort of sexual selection has been the most\r\npowerful means of changing the races of man. I can show that the\r\ndifferent races have a widely different standard of beauty. Among\r\nsavages the most powerful men will have the pick of the women, and they\r\nwill generally leave the most descendants.\r\n\r\nI have collected a few notes on Man, but I do not suppose I shall ever\r\nuse them. Do you intend to follow out your views, and if so would you\r\nlike at some future time to have my few references and notes?\r\n\r\nI am sure I hardly know whether they are of any value, and they are at\r\npresent in a state of chaos.\r\n\r\nThere is much more that I should like to write but I have not\r\nstrength.--Believe me, dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nOur aristocracy is handsomer? (more hideous according to a Chinese or\r\nnegro) than the middle classes, from pick of women; but oh what a scheme\r\nis primogeniture for destroying Natural Selection! I fear my letter will\r\nbe barely intelligible to you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. May 29 [1864]._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--You are always so ready to appreciate what others do,\r\nand especially to overestimate my desultory efforts, that I cannot be\r\nsurprised at your very kind and flattering remarks on my papers. I am\r\nglad, however, that you have made a few critical observations, and am\r\nonly sorry you were not well enough to make more, as that enables me to\r\nsay a few words in explanation.\r\n\r\nMy great fault is haste. An idea strikes me, I think over it for a few\r\ndays, and then write away with such illustrations as occur to me while\r\ngoing on. I therefore look at the subject almost solely from one point\r\nof view. Thus in my paper on Man[41] I aim solely at showing that brutes\r\nare modified in a _great variety_ of ways by Natural Selection, but that\r\nin _none of these particular_ ways can man be modified, because of the\r\nsuperiority of his intellect. I therefore no doubt overlook a few\r\nsmaller points in which Natural Selection may still act on men and\r\nbrutes alike. Colour is one of them, and I have alluded to this in\r\ncorrelation to constitution in an abstract I have made at Sclater's\r\nrequest for the _Natural History Review_.[42] At the same time, there is\r\nso much evidence of migrations and displacements of races of man, and so\r\nmany cases of peoples of distinct physical characters inhabiting the\r\nsame or similar regions, and also of races of uniform physical\r\ncharacters inhabiting widely dissimilar regions, that the external\r\ncharacteristics of the chief races of man must I think be older than his\r\npresent geographical distribution, and the modifications produced by\r\ncorrelation to favourable variations of constitution be only a secondary\r\ncause of external modification.\r\n\r\nI hope you may get the returns from the Army. They would be very\r\ninteresting, but I do not expect the results would be favourable to your\r\nview.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the constant battles of savages leading to selection of\r\nphysical superiority, I think it would be very imperfect, and subject to\r\nso many exceptions and irregularities that it could produce no\r\n_definite_ result. For instance, the strongest and bravest men would\r\nlead, and expose themselves most, and would therefore be most subject to\r\nwounds and death. And the physical energy which led to any one tribe\r\ndelighting in war might lead to its extermination by inducing quarrels\r\nwith all surrounding tribes and leading them to combine against it.\r\nAgain, superior cunning, stealth and swiftness of foot, or even better\r\nweapons, would often lead to victory as well as mere physical strength.\r\nMoreover this kind of more or less perpetual war goes on among all\r\nsavage peoples. It could lead therefore to no differential characters,\r\nbut merely to the keeping up of a certain average standard of bodily and\r\nmental health and vigour. So with selection of variations adapted to\r\nspecial habits of life, as fishing, paddling, riding, climbing, etc.\r\netc., in different races: no doubt it must act to some extent, but will\r\nit be ever so rigid as to induce a definite physical modification, and\r\ncan we imagine it to have had any part in producing the distinct races\r\nthat now exist?\r\n\r\nThe sexual selection you allude to will also, I think, have been equally\r\nuncertain in its results. In the very lowest tribes there is rarely much\r\npolygamy, and women are more or less a matter of purchase. There is also\r\nlittle difference of social condition, and I think it rarely happens\r\nthat any healthy and undeformed man remains without wife and children. I\r\nvery much doubt the often-repeated assertion that our aristocracy are\r\nmore beautiful than the middle classes. I allow that they present\r\n_specimens_ of the highest kind of beauty, but I doubt the average. I\r\nhave noticed in country places a greater average amount of good looks\r\namong the middle classes, and besides, we unavoidably combine in our\r\nidea of beauty, intellectual expression and refinement of _manner_,\r\nwhich often make the less appear the more beautiful. Mere physical\r\nbeauty--that is, a healthy and regular development of the body and\r\nfeatures approaching to the _mean_ or _type_ of European man--I believe\r\nis quite as frequent in one class of society as the other, and much more\r\nfrequent in rural districts than in cities.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the rank of man in zoological classification, I fear I\r\nhave not made myself intelligible. I never meant to adopt Owen's or any\r\nother such views, but only to point out that from _one_ point of view he\r\nwas right. I hold that a distinct _family_ for man, as Huxley allows, is\r\nall that can possibly be given him zoologically. But at the same time,\r\nif my theory is true--that while the animals which surrounded him have\r\nbeen undergoing modification in _all_ parts of their bodies to a\r\n_generic_ or even _family_ degree of difference, he has been changing\r\nalmost wholly in the brain and head--then, in geological antiquity the\r\n_species_ of man may be as old as many mammalian _families_, and the\r\norigin of the _family_ man may date back to a period when some of the\r\norders first originated.\r\n\r\nAs to the theory of Natural Selection itself, I shall always maintain it\r\nto be actually yours and yours only. You had worked it out in details I\r\nhad never thought of, years before I had a ray of light on the subject,\r\nand my paper would never have convinced anybody or been noticed as more\r\nthan an ingenious speculation, whereas your book has revolutionised the\r\nstudy of natural history, and carried away captive the best men of the\r\npresent age. All the merit I claim is the having been the means of\r\ninducing _you_ to write and publish at once.\r\n\r\nI may possibly some day go a little more into this subject (of Man),\r\nand, if I do, will accept the kind offer of your notes. I am now,\r\nhowever, beginning to write the \"Narrative of my Travels\" which will\r\noccupy me a long time, as I hate writing narrative, and after Bates's\r\nbrilliant success rather fear to fail. I shall introduce a few chapters\r\non geographical distribution and other such topics.\r\n\r\nSir C. Lyell, while agreeing with my main argument on Man, thinks I am\r\nwrong in wanting to put him back into Miocene times, and thinks I do not\r\nappreciate the immense interval even to the later Pliocene. But I still\r\nmaintain my view, which in fact is a logical result of my theory, for if\r\nman originated in later Pliocene times, when almost all mammalia were of\r\nclosely allied species to those now living, and many even identical,\r\nthen man has _not_ been stationary in bodily structure while animals\r\nhave been varying, and my theory will be proved to be all wrong.\r\n\r\nIn Murchison's address to the Geographical Society just delivered he\r\npoints out Africa, as being the _oldest_ existing land. He says there is\r\n_no_ evidence of its having been ever submerged during the tertiary\r\nepoch. Here, then, is evidently the place to find _early man_. I hope\r\nsomething good may be found in Borneo, and that then means may be found\r\nto explore the still more promising regions of tropical Africa, for we\r\ncan expect nothing of man _very_ early in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt has given me great pleasure to find that there are symptoms of\r\nimprovement in your health. I hope you will not exert yourself too soon\r\nor write more than is quite agreeable to you. I think I made out every\r\nword of your letter though it was not always easy.--Believe me, my dear\r\nDarwin, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. June 15, 1864._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,--You must not suppose from my delay that I have not been\r\nmuch interested by your long letter. I write now merely to thank you,\r\nand just to say that probably you are right on all the points you touch\r\non except, as I think, about sexual selection, which I will not give up.\r\n\r\nMy belief in it, however, is contingent on my general beliefs in sexual\r\nselection. It is an awful stretcher to believe that a peacock's tail was\r\nthus formed; but believing it, I believe in the same principle somewhat\r\nmodified applied to man.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether my notes would be of any use to you, and as far as I\r\nremember they are chiefly on sexual selection.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear that you are on your Travels. I believe you will\r\nfind it a very convenient vehicle for miscellaneous discussion. With\r\nyour admirable powers of writing, I cannot doubt that you will make an\r\nexcellent book.--Believe me, dear Wallace, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--A great gun, Flourens, has written a little dull book against me;\r\nwhich pleases me much, for it is plain that our good work is spreading\r\nin France. He speaks of the _engouement_ about this book, \"so full of\r\nempty and presumptuous thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. January 29, 1865._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I must ease my mind by saying how much I admire the\r\ntwo papers you have sent me.\r\n\r\nThat on parrots[43] contained most new matter to me, and interested me\r\n_extremely_; that in the _Geographical Journal_[44] strikes me as an\r\nepitome of the whole theory of geographical distribution: the comparison\r\nof Borneo and New Guinea, the relation of the volcanic outbursts and the\r\nrequired subsidence, and the comparison of the supposed conversion of\r\nthe Atlantic into a great archipelago, seemed to me the three best hits.\r\nThey are both indeed excellent papers.--Believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nDo try what hard work will do to banish painful thoughts.[45]\r\n\r\nP.S.--During one of the later French voyages, a _wild_ pig was killed\r\nand brought from the Aru Islands to Paris. Am I not right in inferring\r\nthat this must have been introduced and run wild? If you have a clear\r\nopinion on this head, may I quote you?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_5 Westbourne Grove Terrace, W. January 31, [1865?]._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for your kind letter. I send you now a few\r\nmore papers. One on Man is not much in your line. The other three are\r\nbird lists, but in the introductory remarks are a few facts of\r\ndistribution that may be of use to you, and as you have them already in\r\nthe _Zoological Proceedings_, you can cut these up if you want\r\n\"extracts.\"\r\n\r\nI hope you do not very much want the Aru pig to be a domestic animal run\r\nwild, because I have no doubt myself it was the species peculiar to the\r\nNew Guinea fauna (_Sus papuensis_, Less.), a very distinct form. I have\r\nno doubt it is this species, though I did not get it myself there,\r\nbecause I was told that on a small island near, called there Pulo babi\r\n(Pig Island), was a race of pigs (different from and larger than those\r\nof the large islands) which had originated from the wreck of a large\r\nship near a century ago. The productions of the Aru Islands closely\r\nresemble those of New Guinea, more than half the species of birds being\r\nidentical, as well as about half of the few known mammals.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to work at some semi-mechanical work, drawing up\r\ncatalogues of parts of my collection for publication.\r\n\r\nI enclose my \"carte.\" Have you a photograph of yourself of any kind you\r\ncan send me? When you come to town next, may I beg the honour of a\r\nsitting for my brother-in-law, Mr. Sims, 73 Westbourne Grove?--Yours\r\nvery sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Your paper on _Lythrum salicaria_[46] is most beautiful. What a\r\nwonderful plant it is! I long to hear your paper on Tendrils and hear\r\nwhat you have got out of them. My old friend Spruce, a good botanist and\r\nclose observer, could probably supply you with some facts on that or\r\nother botanical subjects if you would write to him. He is now at Kew,\r\nbut almost as ill as yourself.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. February 1, 1865._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I am much obliged for your photograph, for I have\r\nlately set up a scientific album; and for the papers, which I will read\r\nbefore long. I enclose my own photo, taken by my son, and I have no\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI fear it will be a long time before I shall be able to sit to a\r\nphotographer, otherwise I should be happy to sit to Mr. Sims.\r\n\r\nThanks for information about the Aru pig, which will make me very\r\ncautious.\r\n\r\nIt is a perplexing case, for Nathusius says the skull of the Aru\r\nresembles that of the Chinese breed, and he thinks that _Sus papuensis_\r\nhas been founded on a young skull; D. Blainville stating that an old\r\nskull from New Guinea resembles that of the wild pigs of Malabar, and\r\nthese belong to the _S. scrofa_ type, which is different from the\r\nChinese domestic breed. The latter has not been found in a wild\r\ncondition.--Believe me, dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, Regent's Park, N.W. Sept. 18, 1865._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I should have written before to thank you for the copy of\r\nyour paper on climbing plants, which I read with great interest; I can\r\nimagine how much pleasure the working out must have given you. I was\r\nafraid you were too ill to make it advisable that you should be bothered\r\nwith letters.\r\n\r\nI write now, in hopes you are better, to communicate a curious case of\r\n_variation_ becoming at once _hereditary_, which was brought forward at\r\nthe British Association. I send a note of it on the other side, but if\r\nyou would like more exact particulars, with names and dates and a\r\ndrawing of the bird, I am sure Mr. O'Callaghan would send them to you.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear that you are better, and that your new book is really to\r\ncome out next winter.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Last spring Mr. O'Callaghan was told by a country boy that he had\r\nseen a blackbird with a topknot; on which Mr. O'C. very judiciously told\r\nhim to watch it and communicate further with him. After a time the boy\r\ntold him he had found a blackbird's nest, and had seen this crested bird\r\nnear it and believed he belonged to it. He continued watching the nest\r\ntill the young were hatched. After a time he told Mr. O'C. that two of\r\nthe young birds seemed as if they would have topknots. He was told to\r\nget one of them as soon as it was fledged. However, he was too late, and\r\nthey left the nest, but luckily he found them near and knocked one down\r\nwith a stone, which Mr. O'C. had stuffed and exhibited. It has a fine\r\ncrest, something like that of a Polish fowl, but _larger_ in proportion\r\nto the bird, and very regular and well formed. The male must have been\r\nalmost like the Umbrella bird in miniature, the crest is so large and\r\nexpanded.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. September 22, 1865._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,--I am much obliged for your extract; I never heard of such\r\na case, though such a variation is perhaps the most likely of any to\r\noccur in a state of nature and be inherited, inasmuch as all\r\ndomesticated birds present races with a tuft or with reversed feathers\r\non their heads. I have sometimes thought that the progenitor of the\r\nwhole class must have been a crested animal.\r\n\r\nDo you make any progress with your Journal of travels? I am the more\r\nanxious that you should do so as I have lately read with much interest\r\nsome papers by you on the ouran-outang, etc., in the _Annals_, of which\r\nI have lately been reading the latter volumes, I have always thought\r\nthat Journals of this nature do considerable good by advancing the taste\r\nfor natural history; I know in my own case that nothing ever stimulated\r\nmy zeal so much as reading Humboldt's Personal Narrative. I have not yet\r\nreceived the last part of _Linnean Transactions_, but your paper[47] at\r\npresent will be rather beyond my strength, for though somewhat better I\r\ncan as yet do hardly anything but lie on the sofa and be read aloud to.\r\nBy the way, have you read Tylor and Lecky?[48] Both these books have\r\ninterested me much. I suppose you have read Lubbock?[49] In the last\r\nchapter there is a note about you in which I most cordially concur.[50] I\r\nsee you were at the British Association, but I have heard nothing of it\r\nexcept what I have picked up in the _Reader_. I have heard a rumour that\r\nthe _Reader_ is sold to the Anthropological Society. If you do not\r\nbegrudge the trouble of another note (for my sole channel of news\r\nthrough Hooker is closed by his illness), I should much like to hear\r\nwhether the _Reader_ is thus sold. I should be very sorry for it, as the\r\npaper would thus become sectional in its tendency. If you write, tell me\r\nwhat you are doing yourself.\r\n\r\nThe only news which I have about the \"Origin\" is that Fritz Müller\r\npublished a few months ago a remarkable book[51] in its favour, and\r\nsecondly that a second French edition is just coming out.--Believe me,\r\ndear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, Regents Park. October 2, 1865._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I was just leaving town for a few days when I received\r\nyour letter, or should have replied at once.\r\n\r\nThe _Reader_ has no doubt changed hands, and I am inclined to think for\r\nthe better. It is purchased, I believe, by a gentleman who is a Fellow\r\nof the Anthropological Society, but I see no signs of its being made a\r\nspecial organ of that Society. The Editor (and, I believe, proprietor)\r\nis a Mr. Bendyshe, the most talented man in the Society, and, judging\r\nfrom his speaking, which I have often heard, I should say the articles\r\non \"Simeon and Simony,\" \"Metropolitan Sewage,\" and \"France and Mexico,\"\r\nare his, and these are in my opinion superior to anything that has been\r\nin the _Reader_ for a long time; they have the point and brilliancy\r\nwhich are wanted to make leading articles readable and popular. The\r\narticles on Mill's Political Economy and on Mazzini are also first-rate.\r\nHe has introduced also the plan of having two, and now three, important\r\narticles in each number--one political or social, one literary, and one\r\nscientific. Under the old regime they never had an editor above\r\nmediocrity, except Masson (? Musson); there was a want of unity among\r\nthe proprietors as to the aims and objects of the journal; and there was\r\na want of capital to secure the services of good writers. This seems to\r\nme to be now all changed for the better, and I only hope the rumour of\r\nthat _bête noire_, the Anthropological Society, having anything to do\r\nwith it may not cause our best men of science to withdraw their support\r\nand contributions.\r\n\r\nI have read Tylor, and am reading Lecky. I found the former somewhat\r\ndisconnected and unsatisfactory from the absence of any definite result\r\nor any decided opinion on most of the matters treated of.\r\n\r\nLecky I like much, though he is rather tedious and obscure at times.\r\nMost of what he says has been said so much more forcibly by Buckle,\r\nwhose work I have read for the second time with increased admiration,\r\nalthough with a clear view of some of his errors. Nevertheless, his is I\r\nthink unapproachably the grandest work of the present century, and the\r\none most likely to liberalise opinion. Lubbock's book is very good, but\r\nhis concluding chapter very weak. Why are men of science so dreadfully\r\nafraid to say what they think and believe?\r\n\r\nIn reply to your kind inquiries about myself, I can only say that I am\r\nashamed of my laziness. I have done nothing lately but write a paper on\r\nPigeons for the _Ibis_, and am drawing up a Catalogue of my Collection\r\nof Birds.\r\n\r\nAs to my \"Travels,\" I cannot bring myself to undertake them yet, and\r\nperhaps never shall, unless I should be fortunate enough to get a wife\r\nwho would incite me thereto and assist me therein--which is not likely.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that the \"Origin\" is still working its revolutionary\r\nway on the Continent. Will Müller's book on it be translated?\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear you are a little better. My poor friend Spruce is\r\nstill worse than you are, and I fear now will not recover. He wants to\r\nwrite a book if he gets well enough.--With best wishes, believe me yours\r\nvery faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. January 22, 1866._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I thank you for your paper on Pigeons,[52] which\r\ninterested me, as everything that you write does. Who would ever have\r\ndreamed that monkeys influenced the distribution of pigeons and parrots!\r\nBut I have had a still higher satisfaction; for I finished yesterday\r\nyour paper in the _Linnean Transactions_.[53] It is admirably done. I\r\ncannot conceive that the most firm believer in Species could read it\r\nwithout being staggered. Such papers will make many more converts among\r\nnaturalists than long-winded books such as I shall write if I have\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nI have been particularly struck with your remarks on dimorphism; but I\r\ncannot quite understand one point (p. 22), and should be grateful for an\r\nexplanation, for I want fully to understand you.[54] How can one female\r\nform be selected and the intermediate forms die out, without also the\r\nother extreme form also dying out from not having the advantages of the\r\nfirst selected form? for, as I understand, both female forms occur on\r\nthe same island. I quite agree with your distinction between dimorphic\r\nforms and varieties; but I doubt whether your criterion of dimorphic\r\nforms not producing intermediate offspring will suffice; for I know of\r\na good many varieties, which must be so called, that will not blend or\r\nintermix, but produce offspring quite like either parent.\r\n\r\nI have been particularly struck with your remarks on geological\r\ndistribution in Celebes. It is impossible that anything could be better\r\nput, and [it] would give a cold shudder to the immutable naturalists.\r\n\r\nAnd now I am going to ask a question which you will not like. How does\r\nyour Journal get on? It will be a shame if you do not popularise your\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nMy health is so far improved that I am able to work one or two hours a\r\nday.--Believe me, dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, Regent's Park, N.W. February 4, 1866._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I am very glad to hear you are a little better, and\r\nhope we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing your volume on \"Variation\r\nunder Domestication.\" I do not see the difficulty you seem to feel about\r\ntwo or more female forms of one species. The _most common_ or _typical_\r\nfemale form must have certain characters or qualities which are\r\nsufficiently advantageous to it to enable it to maintain its existence;\r\nin general, such as vary much from it die out. But occasionally a\r\nvariation may occur which has special advantageous characters of its own\r\n(such as mimicking a protected species), and then this variation will\r\nmaintain itself by selection. In no less than three of my _polymorphic_\r\nspecies of Papilio, one of the female forms mimics the _Polydorus_\r\ngroup, which, like the _Æneas_ group in America, seems to have some\r\nspecial protection. In two or three other cases one of the female forms\r\nis confined to a restricted locality, to the conditions of which it is\r\nprobably specially adapted. In other cases one of the female forms\r\nresembles the male, and perhaps receives a protection from the\r\nabundance of the males, in the crowd of which it is passed over. I think\r\nthese considerations render the production of two or three forms of\r\nfemale very conceivable. The physiological difficulty is to me greater,\r\nof how each of two forms of female produces offspring like the other\r\nfemale as well as like itself, but no intermediates?\r\n\r\nIf you \"know varieties that will not blend or intermix, but produce\r\noffspring quite like either parents,\" is not that the very physiological\r\ntest of a species which is wanting for the _complete proof_ of the\r\norigin of species?\r\n\r\nI have by no means given up the idea of writing my Travels, but I think\r\nI shall be able to do it better for the delay, as I can introduce\r\nchapters giving popular sketches of the subjects treated of in my\r\nvarious papers.\r\n\r\nI hope, if things go as I wish this summer, to begin work at it next\r\nwinter. But I feel myself incorrigibly lazy, and have no such system of\r\ncollecting and arranging facts or of making the most of my materials as\r\nyou and many of our hard-working naturalists possess in\r\nperfection.--With best wishes, believe me, dear Darwin, yours most\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, S.E. Tuesday, February, 1866._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--After I had dispatched my last note, the simple\r\nexplanation which you give had occurred to me, and seems satisfactory. I\r\ndo not think you understand what I mean by the non-blending of certain\r\nvarieties. It does not refer to fertility. An instance will explain. I\r\ncrossed the Painted Lady and Purple sweet peas, which are very\r\ndifferently coloured varieties, and got, even out of the same pod, both\r\nvarieties perfect, but none intermediate. Something of this kind, I\r\nshould think, must occur at first with your butterflies and the three\r\nforms of Lythrum; though these cases are in appearance so wonderful, I\r\ndo not know that they are really more so than every female in the world\r\nproducing distinct male and female offspring.\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad that you mean to go on preparing your\r\nJournal.--Believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Hurstpierpoint, Sussex. July 2, 1866._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I have been so repeatedly struck by the utter inability\r\nof numbers of intelligent persons to see clearly, or at all, the\r\nself-acting and necessary effects of Natural Selection, that I am led to\r\nconclude that the term itself, and your mode of illustrating it, however\r\nclear and beautiful to many of us, are yet not the best adapted to\r\nimpress it on the general naturalist public. The two last cases of this\r\nmisunderstanding are (1) the article on \"Darwin and his Teachings\" in\r\nthe last _Quarterly Journal of Science_, which, though very well written\r\nand on the whole appreciative, yet concludes with a charge of something\r\nlike blindness, in your not seeing that Natural Selection requires the\r\nconstant watching of an intelligent \"chooser,\" like man's selection to\r\nwhich you so often compare it; and (2) in Janet's recent work on the\r\n\"Materialism of the Present Day,\" reviewed in last Saturday's _Reader_,\r\nby an extract from which I see that he considers your weak point to be\r\nthat you do not see that \"thought and direction are essential to the\r\naction of Natural Selection.\" The same objection has been made a score\r\nof times by your chief opponents, and I have heard it as often stated\r\nmyself in conversation. Now, I think this arises almost entirely from\r\nyour choice of the term Natural Selection, and so constantly comparing\r\nit in its effects to man's selection, and also to your so frequently\r\npersonifying nature as \"selecting,\" as \"preferring,\" as \"seeking only\r\nthe good of the species,\" etc., etc. To the few this is as clear as\r\ndaylight, and beautifully suggestive, but to many it is evidently a\r\nstumbling-block. I wish, therefore, to suggest to you the possibility of\r\nentirely avoiding this source of misconception in your great work (if\r\nnot now too late), and also in any future editions of the \"Origin,\" and\r\nI think it may be done without difficulty and very effectually by\r\nadopting Spencer's term (which he generally uses in preference to\r\nNatural Selection), viz. \"Survival of the Fittest.\" This term is the\r\nplain expression of the _fact_; \"Natural Selection\" is a metaphorical\r\nexpression of it, and to a certain degree _indirect_ and _incorrect_,\r\nsince, even personifying Nature, she does not so much select special\r\nvariations as exterminate the most unfavourable ones.\r\n\r\nCombined with the enormous multiplying powers of all organisms, and the\r\n\"struggle for existence,\" leading to the constant destruction of by far\r\nthe largest proportion--facts which no one of your opponents, as far as\r\nI am aware, has denied or misunderstood--\"the survival of the fittest,\"\r\nrather than of those which were less fit, could not possibly be denied\r\nor misunderstood. Neither would it be possible to say that to ensure the\r\n\"survival of the fittest\" any _intelligent chooser_ was necessary,\r\nwhereas when you say \"Natural Selection\" acts so as to choose those that\r\nare fittest it _is_ misunderstood, and apparently always will be.\r\nReferring to your book, I find such expressions as \"Man selects only for\r\nhis own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.\" This,\r\nit seems, will always be misunderstood; but if you had said, \"Man\r\nselects only for his own good; Nature, by the inevitable survival of the\r\nfittest, only for that of the being she tends,\" it would have been less\r\nliable to be so.\r\n\r\nI find you use the term Natural Selection in two senses--(1) for the\r\nsimple preservation of favourable and rejection of unfavourable\r\nvariations, in which case it is equivalent to \"survival of the fittest\";\r\n(2) for the _effect or change_ produced by this preservation, as when\r\nyou say, \"To sum up the circumstances favourable or unfavourable to\r\nnatural selection,\" and, again, \"Isolation, also, is an important\r\nelement in the process of natural selection\": here it is not merely\r\n\"survival of the fittest,\" but _change_ produced by survival of the\r\nfittest, that is meant. On looking over your fourth chapter, I find that\r\nthese alterations of terms can be in most cases easily made, while in\r\nsome cases the addition of \"or survival of the fittest\" after \"natural\r\nselection\" would be best; and in others, less likely to be\r\nmisunderstood, the original term might stand alone.\r\n\r\nI could not venture to propose to any other person so great an\r\nalteration of terms, but you, I am sure, will give it an impartial\r\nconsideration, and, if you really think the change will produce a better\r\nunderstanding of your work, will not hesitate to adopt it. It is\r\nevidently also necessary not to personify \"nature\" too much, though I am\r\nvery apt to do it myself, since people will not understand that all such\r\nphrases are metaphors. Natural Selection is, when understood, so\r\nnecessary and self-evident a principle that it is a pity it should be in\r\nany way obscured; and it therefore occurs to me that the free use of\r\n\"survival of the fittest\", which is a compact and accurate definition of\r\nit, would tend much to its being more widely accepted and prevent its\r\nbeing so much misrepresented and misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThere is another objection made by Janet which is also a very common\r\none. It is that the chances are almost infinite against the particular\r\nkind of variation required being coincident with each change of external\r\nconditions, to enable an animal to become modified by Natural Selection\r\nin harmony with such changed conditions; especially when we consider\r\nthat, to have produced the almost infinite modifications of organic\r\nbeings, this coincidence must have taken place an almost infinite number\r\nof times.\r\n\r\nNow it seems to me that you have yourself led to this objection being\r\nmade by so often stating the case too strongly against yourself. For\r\nexample, at the commencement of Chapter IV. you ask if it is \"improbable\r\nthat useful variations should sometimes occur in the course of thousands\r\nof generations\"; and a little further on you say, \"unless profitable\r\nvariations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.\" Now, such\r\nexpressions have given your opponents the advantage of assuming that\r\n_favourable_ variations are _rare accidents_, or may even for long\r\nperiods never occur at all, and thus Janet's argument would appear to\r\nmany to have great force. I think it would be better to do away with all\r\nsuch qualifying expressions, and constantly maintain (what I certainly\r\nbelieve to be the fact) that _variations of every kind_ are _always\r\noccurring_ in _every part_ of _every species_, and therefore that\r\nfavourable variations are _always ready_ when wanted. You have, I am\r\nsure, abundant materials to prove this, and it is, I believe, the grand\r\nfact that renders modification and adaptation to conditions almost\r\nalways possible. I would put the burthen of proof on my opponents to\r\nshow that any one organ, structure, or faculty does _not vary_, even\r\nduring one generation, among all the individuals of a species; and also\r\nto show any _mode or way_ in which any such organ, etc., does not vary.\r\nI would ask them to give any reason for supposing that any organ, etc.,\r\nis ever _absolutely identical_ at any _one time in all the individuals_\r\nof a species, and if not, then it is always varying, and there are\r\nalways materials which, from the simple fact that the \"fittest survive,\"\r\nwill tend to the modification of the race into harmony with changed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nI hope these remarks may be intelligible to you, and that you will be so\r\nkind as to let me know what you think of them.\r\n\r\nI have not heard for some time how you are getting on. I hope you are\r\nstill improving in health, and that you will be able now to get on with\r\nyour great work, for which so many thousands are looking with\r\ninterest.--With best wishes, believe me, my dear Darwin, yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. July 5, [1866]._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have been much interested by your letter, which is\r\nas clear as daylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the\r\nadvantages of H. Spencer's excellent expression of \"the survival of the\r\nfittest.\" This, however, had not occurred to me till reading your\r\nletter. It is, however, a great objection to this term that it cannot be\r\nused as a substantive governing a verb; and that this is a real\r\nobjection I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words \"Natural\r\nSelection.\"\r\n\r\nI formerly thought, probably in an exaggerated degree, that it was a\r\ngreat advantage to bring into connection natural and artificial\r\nselection; this indeed led me to use a term in common, and I still think\r\nit some advantage. I wish I had received your letter two months ago, for\r\nI would have worked in \"the survival,\" etc., often in the new edition of\r\nthe \"Origin,\" which is now almost printed off, and of which I will, of\r\ncourse, send you a copy. I will use the term in my next book on Domestic\r\nAnimals, etc., from which, by the way, I plainly see that you expect\r\n_much_ too much. The term Natural Selection has now been so largely used\r\nabroad and at home that I doubt whether it could be given up, and with\r\nall its faults I should be sorry to see the attempt made. Whether it\r\nwill be rejected must now depend on the \"survival of the fittest.\"\r\n\r\nAs in time the term must grow intelligible, the objections to its use\r\nwill grow weaker and weaker. I doubt whether the use of any term would\r\nhave made the subject intelligible to some minds, clear as it is to\r\nothers; for do we not see, even to the present day, Malthus on\r\nPopulation absurdly misunderstood? This reflection about Malthus has\r\noften comforted me when I have been vexed at the misstatement of my\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nAs for M. Janet,[55] he is a metaphysician, and such gentlemen are so\r\nacute that I think they often misunderstand common folk. Your criticism\r\non the double sense in which I have used Natural Selection is new to me\r\nand unanswerable; but my blunder has done no harm, for I do not believe\r\nthat anyone excepting you has ever observed it. Again, I agree that I\r\nhave said too much about \"favourable variations,\" but I am inclined to\r\nthink you put the opposite side too strongly; if every part of every\r\nbeing varied, I do not think we should see the same end or object gained\r\nby such wonderfully diversified means.\r\n\r\nI hope you are enjoying the country and are in good health, and are\r\nworking hard at your Malay Archipelago book, for I will always put this\r\nwish in every note I write to you, like some good people always put in a\r\ntext. My health keeps much the same, or rather improves, and I am able\r\nto work some hours daily.--With many thanks for your interesting letter,\r\nbelieve me, my dear Wallace, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I suppose you have read the last number of H. Spencer; I have been\r\nstruck with astonishment at the prodigality of original thought in it.\r\nBut how unfortunate it is that it seems scarcely ever possible to\r\ndiscriminate between the direct effect of external influences and the\r\n\"survival of the fittest.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, Regent's Park, N.W. Nov. 19, 1866._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for the fourth edition of the \"Origin,\" which\r\nI am glad to see grows so vigorously at each moult, although it\r\nundergoes no metamorphosis. How curious it is that Dr. Wells should so\r\nclearly have seen the principle of Natural Selection fifty years ago,\r\nand that it should have struck no one that it was a great principle of\r\nuniversal application in nature!\r\n\r\nWe are going to have a discussion on \"Mimicry, as producing Abnormal\r\nSexual Characters,\" at the Entomological to-night. I have a butterfly\r\n(Diadema) of which the female is metallic blue, the male dusky brown,\r\ncontrary to the rule in all other species of the genus, and in almost\r\nall insects; but the explanation is easy--it mimics a metallic\r\n_Euploea_, and so gets a protection perhaps more efficient than its\r\nallies derive from their sombre colours, and which females require much\r\nmore than males. I read a paper on this at the British Association. Have\r\nyou the report published at Nottingham in a volume by Dr. Robertson? If\r\nso, you can tell me if my paper is printed in full.\r\n\r\nI suppose you have read Agassiz's marvellous theory of the Great\r\nAmazonian glacier, 2,000 miles long! I presume that will be a _little_\r\ntoo much, even for you. I have been writing a little popular paper on\r\n\"Glacial Theories\" for the _Quarterly Journal of Science_ of January\r\nnext, in which I stick up for glaciers in North America and icebergs in\r\nthe Amazon!\r\n\r\nI was very glad to hear from Lubbock that your health is permanently\r\nimproved. I hope therefore you will be able to give us a volume per\r\nannum of your _magnum opus_, with all the facts as you now have them,\r\nleaving additions to come in new editions.\r\n\r\nI am working a little at another family of my butterflies, and find the\r\nusual interesting and puzzling cases of variation, but no such phenomena\r\nas in the Papilionidæ.--With best wishes, believe me, my dear Darwin,\r\nyours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_6 Queen Anne Street, W. Monday, January, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I return by this post the _Journal_.[56] Your résumé of\r\nglacier action seems to me very good, and has interested my brother\r\nmuch, and as the subject is new to him he is a better judge. That is\r\nquite a new and perplexing point which you specify about the freshwater\r\nfishes during the glacial period.\r\n\r\nI have also been very glad to see the article on Lyell, which seems to\r\nme to be done by some good man.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say when with you--but I then indeed did not know so much as\r\nI do now--that the sexual, i.e. _ornamental_, differences in fishes,\r\nwhich differences are sometimes very great, offer a difficulty in the\r\nwide extension of the view that the female is not brightly coloured on\r\naccount of the danger which she would incur in the propagation of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nI very much enjoyed my long conversation with you; and to-day we return\r\nhome, and I to my horrid dull work of correcting proof-sheets.--Believe\r\nme, my dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I had arranged to go and see your collection on Saturday evening,\r\nbut my head suddenly failed after luncheon, and I was forced to lie down\r\nall the rest of the day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. February 23, 1867._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,--I much regretted that I was unable to call on you, but\r\nafter Monday I was unable even to leave the house. On Monday evening I\r\ncalled on Bates and put a difficulty before him, which he could not\r\nanswer, and, as on some former similar occasion, his first suggestion\r\nwas, \"You had better ask Wallace.\" My difficulty is, why are\r\ncaterpillars sometimes so beautifully and artistically coloured? Seeing\r\nthat many are coloured to escape danger, I can hardly attribute their\r\nbright colour in other cases to mere physical conditions. Bates says the\r\nmost gaudy caterpillar he ever saw in Amazonia (of a Sphinx) was\r\nconspicuous at the distance of yards from its black and red colouring\r\nwhilst feeding on large green leaves. If anyone objected to male\r\nbutterflies having been made beautiful by sexual selection, and asked\r\nwhy should they not have been made beautiful as well as their\r\ncaterpillars, what would you answer? I could not answer, but should\r\nmaintain my ground. Will you think over this, and some time, either by\r\nletter or when we meet, tell me what you think? Also, I want to know\r\nwhether your _female_ mimetic butterfly is more beautiful and brighter\r\nthan the male?\r\n\r\nWhen next in London I must get you to show me your Kingfishers.\r\n\r\nMy health is a dreadful evil; I failed in half my engagements during\r\nthis last visit to London.--Believe me, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe answer to this letter is missing, but in Vol. II. of \"My Life,\" p.\r\n3, Wallace writes:\r\n\r\n    \"On reading this letter I almost at once saw what seemed to be a\r\n    very easy and probable explanation of the facts. I had then just\r\n    been preparing for publication (in the _Westminster Review_) my\r\n    rather elaborate paper on 'Mimicry and Protective Colouring,' and\r\n    the numerous cases in which specially showy and slow-flying\r\n    butterflies were known to have a peculiar odour and taste which\r\n    protected them from the attacks of insect-eating birds and other\r\n    animals led me at once to suppose that the gaudily coloured\r\n    caterpillars must have a similar protection. I had just\r\n    ascertained from Mr. Jenner Weir that one of our common white\r\n    moths (_Spilosoma menthastri_) would not be eaten by most of the\r\n    small birds in his aviary, nor by young turkeys. Now, as a _white_\r\n    moth is as conspicuous in the dusk as a coloured caterpillar in\r\n    the daylight, this case seemed to me so much on a par with the\r\n    other that I felt almost sure my explanation would turn out\r\n    correct. I at once wrote to Mr. Darwin to this effect.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. February 26, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Bates was quite right, you are the man to apply to in\r\na difficulty. I never heard anything more ingenious than your\r\nsuggestion, and I hope you may be able to prove it true. That is a\r\nsplendid fact about the white moths; it warms one's very blood to see a\r\ntheory thus almost proved to be true.[57] With respect to the beauty of\r\nmale butterflies, I must as yet think that it is due to sexual\r\nselection; there is some evidence that dragonflies are attracted by\r\nbright colours; but what leads me to the above belief is so many male\r\nOrthoptera and Cicadas having musical instruments. This being the case,\r\nthe analogy of birds makes me believe in sexual selection with respect\r\nto colour in insects. I wish I had strength and time to make some of the\r\nexperiments suggested by you; but I thought butterflies would not pair\r\nin confinement; I am sure I have heard of some such difficulty. Many\r\nyears ago I had a dragonfly painted with gorgeous colours, but I never\r\nhad an opportunity of fairly trying it.\r\n\r\nThe reason of my being so much interested just at present about sexual\r\nselection is that I have almost resolved to publish a little essay on\r\nthe Origin of Mankind, and I still strongly think (though I failed to\r\nconvince you, and this to me is the heaviest blow possible) that sexual\r\nselection has been the main agent in forming the races of man.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is another subject which I shall introduce in my\r\nessay, viz. expression of countenance. Now, do you happen to know by any\r\nodd chance a very good-natured and acute observer in the Malay\r\nArchipelago who, you think, would make a few easy observations for me on\r\nthe expression of the Malays when excited by various emotions. For in\r\nthis case I would send to such person a list of queries.--I thank you\r\nfor your most interesting letters, and remain yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. March 11, 1867._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I return your queries, but cannot answer them with any\r\ncertainty. For the Malays I should say Yes to 1, 3, 8, 9, 10 and 17, and\r\nNo to 12, 13 and 16; but I cannot be _certain_ in any one. But do you\r\nthink these things are of much importance? I am inclined to think that\r\nif you could get good direct observations you would find some of them\r\noften differ from tribe to tribe, from island to island, and sometimes\r\nfrom village to village. Some no doubt may be deep-seated, and would\r\nimply organic differences; but can you tell beforehand which these are?\r\nI presume the Frenchman shrugs his shoulders whether he is of the\r\nNorman, Breton, or Gaulish stock. Would it not be a good thing to send\r\nyour List of Queries to some of the Bombay and Calcutta papers? as there\r\nmust be numbers of Indian judges and other officers who would be\r\ninterested and would send you hosts of replies. The Australian papers\r\nand New Zealand might also publish them, and then you would have a fine\r\nbasis to go on.\r\n\r\nIs your essay on Variation in Man to be a supplement to your volume on\r\nDomesticated Animals and Cultivated Plants? I would rather see your\r\nsecond volume on \"The Struggle for Existence, etc.,\" for I doubt if we\r\nhave a sufficiency of fair and accurate facts to do anything with man.\r\nHuxley, I believe, is at work upon it.\r\n\r\nI have been reading Murray's volume on the Geographical Distribution of\r\nMammals. He has some good ideas here and there, but is quite unable to\r\nunderstand Natural Selection, and makes a most absurd mess of his\r\ncriticism of your views on oceanic islands.\r\n\r\nBy the bye, what an interesting volume the whole of your materials on\r\nthat subject would, I am sure, make.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. March, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I thank you much for your two notes. The case of Julia\r\nPastrana[58] is a splendid addition to my other cases of correlated teeth\r\nand hair, and I will add it in correcting the proof of my present\r\nvolume. Pray let me hear in course of the summer if you get any evidence\r\nabout the gaudy caterpillars. I should much like to give (or quote if\r\npublished) this idea of yours, if in any way supported, as suggested by\r\nyou. It will, however, be a long time hence, for I can see that sexual\r\nselection is growing into quite a large subject, which I shall introduce\r\ninto my essay on Man, supposing that I ever publish it.\r\n\r\nI had intended giving a chapter on Man, inasmuch as many call him (not\r\n_quite_ truly) an eminently _domesticated_ animal; but I found the\r\nsubject too large for a chapter. Nor shall I be capable of treating the\r\nsubject well, and my sole reason for taking it up is that I am pretty\r\nwell convinced that sexual selection has played an important part in the\r\nformation of races, and sexual selection has always been a subject which\r\nhas interested me much.\r\n\r\nI have been very glad to see your impression from memory on the\r\nexpressions of Malays. I fully agree with you that the subject is in no\r\nway an important one: it is simply a \"hobby-horse\" with me about\r\ntwenty-seven years old; and after thinking that I would write an essay\r\non Man, it flashed on me that I could work in some \"supplemental remarks\r\non expression.\" After the horrid, tedious, dull work of my present huge\r\nand, I fear, unreadable book, I thought I would amuse myself with my\r\nhobby-horse. The subject is, I think, more curious and more amenable to\r\nscientific treatment than you seem willing to allow. I want, anyhow, to\r\nupset Sir C. Bell's view, given in his most interesting work, \"The\r\nAnatomy of Expression,\" that certain muscles have been given to man\r\nsolely that he may reveal to other men his feelings. I want to try and\r\nshow how expressions have arisen.\r\n\r\nThat is a good suggestion about newspapers; but my experience tells me\r\nthat private applications are generally most fruitful. I will, however,\r\nsee if I can get the queries inserted in some Indian paper. I do not\r\nknow names or addresses of any other papers.\r\n\r\nI have just ordered, but not yet received, Murray's book: Lindley used\r\nto call him a blunder-headed man. It is very doubtful whether I shall\r\never have strength to publish the latter part of my materials.\r\n\r\nMy two female amanuenses are busy with friends, and I fear this scrawl\r\nwill give you much trouble to read.--With many thanks, yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. April 29, 1867._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,--I have been greatly interested by your letter;[59] but\r\nyour view is not new to me. If you will look at p. 240 of the fourth\r\nedition of the \"Origin,\" you will find it very briefly given with two\r\nextremes of the peacock and black grouse. A more general statement is\r\ngiven at p. 101, or at p. 89 of the first edition, for I have long\r\nentertained this view, though I have never had space to develop it. But\r\nI had not sufficient knowledge to generalise as far as you do about\r\ncolouring and nesting. In your paper, perhaps you will just allude to my\r\nscanty remark in the fourth edition, because in my essay upon Man I\r\nintend to discuss the whole subject of sexual selection, explaining, as\r\nI believe it does, much with respect to man. I have collected all my old\r\nnotes and partly written my discussion, and it would be flat work for me\r\nto give the leading idea as exclusively from you. But as I am sure from\r\nyour greater knowledge of ornithology and entomology that you will write\r\na much better discussion than I could, your paper will be of great use\r\nto me. Nevertheless, I must discuss the subject fully in my essay on\r\nMan. When we met at the Zoological Society and I asked you about the\r\nsexual differences in kingfishers, I had this subject in view; as I had\r\nwhen I suggested to Bates the difficulty about gaudy caterpillars which\r\nyou have so admirably (as I believe it will prove) explained. I have got\r\none capital case (genus forgotten) of an [Australian] bird in which the\r\nfemale has long-tailed plumes and which consequently builds a different\r\nnest from all her allies.[60] With respect to certain female birds being\r\nmore brightly coloured than the males, and the latter incubating, I have\r\ngone a little into the subject and cannot say that I am fully satisfied.\r\nI remember mentioning to you the case of Rhynchæa, but its nesting seems\r\nunknown. In some other cases the difference in brightness seemed to me\r\nhardly sufficiently accounted for by the principle of protection. At the\r\nFalkland Islands there is a carrion hawk in which the female (as I\r\nascertained by dissection) is the brightest coloured, and I doubt\r\nwhether protection will here apply; but I wrote several months ago to\r\nthe Falklands to make inquiries. The conclusion to which I have been\r\nleaning is that in some of these abnormal cases the colour happened to\r\nvary in the female alone, and was transmitted to females alone, and that\r\nher variations have been selected through the admiration of the male.\r\n\r\nIt is a very interesting subject, but I shall not be able to go on with\r\nit for the next five or six months, as I am fully employed in correcting\r\ndull proof-sheets; when I return to the work I shall find it much better\r\ndone by you than I could have succeeded in doing.\r\n\r\nWith many thanks for your very interesting note, believe me, dear\r\nWallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how we hit on the same ideas. I have endeavoured to show\r\nin my MS. discussion that nearly the same principles account for young\r\nbirds _not_ being gaily coloured in many cases--but this is too complex\r\na point for a note.\r\n\r\n_Postscript. Down. April 29._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--On reading over your letter again, and on further\r\nreflection, I do not think (as far as I remember my words) that I\r\nexpressed myself _nearly strongly_ enough as to the value and beauty of\r\nyour generalisation, viz. that all birds in which the female is\r\nconspicuously or brightly coloured build in holes or under domes. I\r\nthought that this was the explanation in many, perhaps most cases, but\r\ndo not think I should ever have extended my view to your generalisation.\r\nForgive me troubling you with this P.S.--Yours,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. May 5, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--The offer of your valuable notes is _most_ generous,\r\nbut it would vex me to take so much from you, as it is certain that you\r\ncould work up the subject very much better than I could. Therefore I\r\nearnestly and without any reservation hope that you will proceed with\r\nyour paper, so that I return your notes.\r\n\r\nYou seem already to have well investigated the subject. I confess on\r\nreceiving your note that I felt rather flat at my recent work being\r\nalmost thrown away, but I did not intend to show this feeling. As a\r\nproof how little advance I had made on the subject, I may mention that\r\nthough I had been collecting facts on the colouring and other sexual\r\ndifferences in mammals, your explanation with respect to the females had\r\nnot occurred to me. I am surprised at my own stupidity, but I have long\r\nrecognised how much clearer and deeper your insight into matters is than\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nI do not know how far you have attended to the laws of inheritance, so\r\nwhat follows may be obvious to you. I have begun my discussion on sexual\r\nselection by showing that new characters often appear in one sex and are\r\ntransmitted to that sex alone, and that from some unknown cause such\r\ncharacters apparently appear oftener in the male than in the female.\r\nSecondly, characters may be developed and be confined to the male, and\r\nlong afterwards be transferred to the female. Thirdly, characters may,\r\nagain, arise in either sex and be transmitted to both sexes, either in\r\nan equal or unequal degree. In this latter case I have supposed that the\r\nsurvival of the fittest has come into play with female birds and kept\r\nthe female dull-coloured. With respect to the absence of spurs in female\r\ngallinaceous birds, I presume that they would be in the way during\r\nincubation; at least, I have got the case of a German breed of fowls in\r\nwhich the hens were spurred, and were found to disturb and break their\r\neggs much.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the females of deer not having horns, I presume it is to\r\nsave the loss of organised matter.\r\n\r\nIn your note you speak of sexual selection and protection as sufficient\r\nto account for the colouring of all animals; but it seems to me doubtful\r\nhow far this will come into play with some of the lower animals, such as\r\nsea anemones, some corals, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Haeckel has recently well shown that the transparency\r\nand absence of colour in the lower oceanic animals, belonging to the\r\nmost different classes, may be well accounted for on the principle of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nSome time or other I should like much to know where your paper on the\r\nnests of birds has appeared, and I shall be extremely anxious to read\r\nyour paper in the _Westminster Review_.\r\n\r\nYour paper on the sexual colouring of birds will, I have no doubt, be\r\nvery striking.\r\n\r\nForgive me, if you can, for a touch of illiberality about your paper,\r\nand believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. July 6, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I am very much obliged for your article on Mimicry,[61]\r\nthe whole of which I have read with the greatest interest. You certainly\r\nhave the art of putting your ideas with remarkable force and clearness;\r\nnow that I am slaving over proof-sheets it makes me almost envious.\r\n\r\nI have been particularly glad to read about the birds' nests, and I must\r\nprocure the _Intellectual Observer_; but the point which I think struck\r\nme most was about its being of no use to the Heliconias to acquire in a\r\nslight degree a disagreeable taste. What a curious case is that about\r\nthe coral snakes. The summary, and indeed the whole, is excellent, and I\r\nhave enjoyed it much.--With many thanks, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH.

Wednesday, [August or September, 1867]._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I am very sorry I was out when you called yesterday. I had\r\njust gone to the Zoological Gardens, and I met Sir C. Lyell, who told me\r\nyou were in town.\r\n\r\nIf you should have time to go to Bayswater, I think you would be pleased\r\nto see the collections which I have displayed there in the form of an\r\n_exhibition_ (though the public will not go to see it).\r\n\r\nIf you can go, with any friends, I should like to meet you there if you\r\ncan appoint a time.\r\n\r\nI am glad to find you continue in tolerable health.--Believe me yours\r\nvery faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the Duke of Argyll's criticisms, and the more\r\npretentious one in the last number of the _North British Review_?\r\n\r\nI have written a little article answering them both, but I do not yet\r\nknow where to get it published.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_76-1/2 Westbourne Grove, Bayswater, W. October 1, 1867._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I am sorry I was not in town when your note came. I took a\r\nshort trip to Scotland after the British Association Meeting, and went\r\nup Ben Lawers. It was very cold and wet, and I could not find a\r\ncompanion or I should have gone as far as Glen Roy.\r\n\r\nMy article on \"Creation by Law,\" in reply to the Duke of Argyll and the\r\n_North British_ reviewer, is in the present month's number of the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Science_. I cannot send you a copy because they do\r\nnot allow separate copies to be printed.\r\n\r\nThere is a nice illustration of the _predicted_ Madagascar moth and\r\n_Angræcum sesquipedale_.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad to know whether I have done it satisfactorily to you,\r\nand hope you will not be so very sparing of criticism as you usually\r\nare.\r\n\r\nI hope you are getting on well with your great book. I hear a rumour\r\nthat we are to have _one_ vol. of it about Christmas.\r\n\r\nI quite forget whether I told you that I have a little boy, now three\r\nmonths old, and have named him Herbert Spencer (having had a brother\r\nHerbert). I am now staying chiefly in the country, at Hurstpierpoint,\r\nbut come up to town once a month at least. You may address simply,\r\n\"Hurstpierpoint, Sussex.\"\r\n\r\nHoping your health is tolerable and that all your family are well,\r\nbelieve me, dear Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. October 12 and 13, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I ordered the journal a long time ago, but by some\r\noversight received it only yesterday and read it. You will think my\r\npraise not worth having from being so indiscriminate, but if I am to\r\nspeak the truth, I must say I admire every word.\r\n\r\nYou have just touched on the points which I particularly wished to see\r\nnoticed. I am glad you had the courage to take up _Angræcum_[62] after\r\nthe Duke's attack; for I believe the principle in this case may be\r\nwidely applied. I like the figure, but I wish the artist had drawn a\r\nbetter sphinx.\r\n\r\nWith respect to beauty, your remarks on hideous objects and on flowers\r\nnot being made beautiful except when of practical use to them strike me\r\nas very good.\r\n\r\nOn this one point of beauty, I can hardly think that the Duke was quite\r\ncandid. I have used in the concluding paragraph of my present book\r\nprecisely the same argument as you have, even bringing in the\r\nbulldog,[63] with respect to variations not having been specially\r\nordained. Your metaphor of the river[64] is new to me, and admirable;\r\nbut your other metaphor, in which you compare classification and complex\r\nmachines, does not seem to me quite appropriate, though I cannot point\r\nout what seems deficient. The point which seems to me strong is that all\r\nnaturalists admit that there is a _natural_ classification, and it is\r\nthis which descent explains. I wish you had insisted a little more\r\nagainst the _North British_[65] reviewer assuming that each variation\r\nwhich appears is a strongly marked one; though by implication you have\r\nmade this _very_, plain. Nothing in your whole article has struck me\r\nmore than your view with respect to the limit of fleetness in the\r\nracehorse and other such cases; I shall try and quote you on this head\r\nin the proof of my concluding chapter. I quite missed this explanation,\r\nthough in the case of wheat I hit upon something analogous. I am glad\r\nyou praise the Duke's book, for I was much struck with it. The part\r\nabout flight seemed to me at first very good, but as the wing is\r\narticulated by a ball-and-socket joint, I suspect the Duke would find it\r\nvery difficult to give any reason against the belief that the wing\r\nstrikes the air more or less obliquely. I have been very glad to see\r\nyour article and the drawing of the butterfly in _Science Gossip_. By\r\nthe way, I cannot but think that you push protection too far in some\r\ncases, as with the stripes on the tiger. I have also this morning read\r\nan excellent abstract in the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ of your paper on\r\nnests;[66] I was not by any means fully converted by your letter, but I\r\nthink now I am so; and I hope it will be published somewhere _in\r\nextenso_. It strikes me as a capital generalisation, and appears to me\r\neven more original than it did at first.\r\n\r\nI have had an excellent and cautious letter from Mr. Geach of Singapore\r\nwith some valuable answers on expression, which I owe to you.\r\n\r\nI heartily congratulate you on the birth of \"Herbert Spencer,\" and may\r\nhe deserve his name, but I hope he will copy his father's style and not\r\nhis namesake's. Pray observe, though I fear I am a month too late, when\r\ntears are first secreted enough to overflow; and write down date.\r\n\r\nI have finished Vol. I. of my book, and I hope the whole will be out by\r\nthe end of November; if you have the patience to read it through, which\r\nis very doubtful, you will find, I think, a large accumulation of facts\r\nwhich will be of service to you in your future papers, and they could\r\nnot be put to better use, for you certainly are a master in the noble\r\nart of reasoning.\r\n\r\nHave you changed your house to Westbourne Grove?\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nThis letter is so badly expressed that it is barely intelligible, but I\r\nam tired with proofs.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Mr. Warington has lately read an excellent and spirited abstract\r\nof the \"Origin\" before the Victoria Institute, and as this is a most\r\northodox body he has gained the name of the devil's advocate. The\r\ndiscussion which followed during three consecutive meetings is very rich\r\nfrom the nonsense talked. If you would care to see the number I could\r\nlend it you.\r\n\r\nI forgot to remark how capitally you turn the table on the Duke, when\r\nyou make him create the _Angræcum_ and moth by special creation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Hurstpierpoint. October 22, 1867._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I am very glad you approve of my article on \"Creation by\r\nLaw\" as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe \"machine metaphor\" is not mine, but the _North British_ reviewer's.\r\nI merely accept it and show that it is on our side and not against us,\r\nbut I do not think it at all a good metaphor to be used as an _argument_\r\neither way. I did not half develop the argument on the limits of\r\nvariation, being myself limited in space; but I feel satisfied that it\r\nis the true answer to the very common and very strong objection, that\r\n\"variation has strict limits.\" The fallacy is the requiring variation in\r\ndomesticity to go beyond the limits of the same variation under nature.\r\nIt does do so sometimes, however, because the conditions of existence\r\nare so different. I do not think a case can be pointed out in which the\r\nlimits of variation under domestication are not up to or beyond those\r\nalready marked out in nature, only we generally get in the _species_ an\r\namount of change which in nature occurs only in the whole range of the\r\n_genus_ or _family_.\r\n\r\nThe many cases, however, in which variation has gone far beyond nature\r\nand has not yet stopped are ignored. For instance, no wild pomaceous\r\nfruit is, I believe, so large as our apples, and no doubt they could be\r\ngot much larger if flavour, etc., were entirely neglected.\r\n\r\nI may perhaps push \"protection\" too far sometimes, for it is my hobby\r\njust now, but as the lion and the tiger are, I think, the only two\r\nnon-arboreal cats, I think the tiger stripe agreeing so well with its\r\nusual habitat is at least a probable case.\r\n\r\nI am rewriting my article on Birds' Nests for the new _Natural History\r\nReview_.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you about the first appearance of _tears_, but it is very\r\nearly--the first week or two, I think. I can see the _Victoria Institute\r\nMagazine_ at the London Library.\r\n\r\nI shall read your book, _every word_. I hear from Sir C. Lyell that you\r\ncome out with a grand new theory at the end, which even the _cautious_\r\n(!) Huxley is afraid of! Sir C. said he could think of nothing else\r\nsince he read it. I long to see it.\r\n\r\nMy address is Hurstpierpoint during the winter, and, when in town,\r\n76-1/2 Westbourne Grove.\r\n\r\nI suppose you will now be going on with your book on Sexual Selection\r\nand Man, by way of relaxation! It is a glorious subject, but will\r\nrequire delicate handling,--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_10 Duchess Street, W. February 7, 1868._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I have to thank you for signing the Memorial as to the\r\nEast London Museum, and also for your kindness in sending me a copy of\r\nyour great book, which I have only just received. I shall take it down\r\nin the country with me next week, and enjoy every line at my leisure.\r\n\r\nAllow me also to congratulate you on the splendid position obtained by\r\nyour second son at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps be glad to hear that I have been for some time\r\nhammering away at my Travels, but I fear I shall make a mess of it. I\r\nshall leave most of the Natural History generalisation, etc., for\r\nanother work, as if I wait to incorporate all, I may wait for\r\nyears.--Hoping you are quite well, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. February 22, [1868?]._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I am hard at work on sexual selection and am driven\r\nhalf mad by the number of collateral points which require investigation,\r\nsuch as the relative numbers of the two sexes, and especially on\r\npolygamy. Can you aid me with respect to birds which have strongly\r\nmarked secondary sexual characters, such as birds of paradise,\r\nhumming-birds, the rupicola or rock-thrush, or any other such cases?\r\nMany gallinaceous birds certainly are polygamous. I suppose that birds\r\nmay be known not to be polygamous if they are seen during the whole\r\nbreeding season to associate in pairs, or if the male incubates, or aids\r\nin feeding the young. Will you have the kindness to turn this in your\r\nmind? but it is a shame to trouble you now that, as I am _heartily_ glad\r\nto hear, you are at work on your Malayan Travels. I am fearfully puzzled\r\nhow far to extend your protective views with respect to the females in\r\nvarious classes. The more I work, the more important sexual selection\r\napparently comes out.\r\n\r\nCan butterflies be polygamous?--i.e. will one male impregnate more than\r\none female?\r\n\r\nForgive me troubling you, and I daresay I shall have to ask your\r\nforgiveness again, and believe me, my dear Wallace, yours most\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Baker has had the kindness to set the Entomological Society\r\ndiscussing the relative numbers of the sexes in insects, and has brought\r\nout some very curious results.\r\n\r\nIs the orang polygamous? But I daresay I shall find that in your papers\r\nin (I think) the _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following group of letters deals with the causes of the sterility of\r\nhybrids (_see_ note in \"More Letters,\" p. 287). Darwin's final view is\r\ngiven in the \"Origin,\" 6th edit., 1900, p. 384. He acknowledges that it\r\nwould be advantageous to two incipient species if, by physiological\r\nisolation due to mutual sterility, they could be kept from blending; but\r\nhe continues: \"After mature reflection, it seems to me that this could\r\nnot have been effected through Natural Selection.\" And finally he\r\nconcludes (p. 386): \"But it would be superfluous to discuss this\r\nquestion in detail; for with plants we have conclusive evidence that the\r\nsterility of crossed species must be due to some principle quite\r\nindependent of Natural Selection. Both Gäartner and Kolreuter have\r\nproved that in genera including numerous species a series can be formed\r\nfrom species which, when crossed, yield fewer and fewer seeds, to\r\nspecies which never produce a single seed, but yet are affected by the\r\npollen of certain other species, for the germen swells. It is here\r\nmanifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which have\r\nalready ceased to yield seeds; so that this acme of sterility, when the\r\ngermen alone is affected, cannot have been gained through selection; and\r\nfrom the laws governing the various grades of sterility being so uniform\r\nthroughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may infer that the\r\ncause, whatever it may be, is the same or nearly the same in all cases.\"\r\n\r\nWallace still adhered to his view (_see_ \"Darwinism,\" 1889, p. 174,\r\n_also_ p. 292 of \"More Letters,\" note 1, and Letter 211, p. 299). The\r\ndiscussion of 1868 began with a letter from Wallace, written towards the\r\nend of February, giving his opinion on the \"Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants\"; the discussion on the sterility of hybrids is at p. 185, Vol.\r\nII., 1st edit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(_Second and third sheets of a letter from Wallace, apparently of\r\nFebruary, 1868._)\r\n\r\nI am in the second volume of your book, and I have been astonished at\r\nthe immense number of interesting facts you have brought together. I\r\nread the chapter on Pangenesis first, for I could not wait. I can hardly\r\ntell you how much I admire it. It is a positive _comfort_ to me to have\r\nany feasible explanation of a difficulty that has always been haunting\r\nme, and I shall never be able to give it up till a better one supplies\r\nits place, and that I think hardly possible. You have now fairly beaten\r\nSpencer on his own ground, for he really offered no solution of the\r\ndifficulties of the problem. The incomprehensible minuteness and vast\r\nnumbers of the physiological germs or atoms (Which themselves must be\r\ncompounded of numbers of Spencer's physiological units) is the only\r\ndifficulty, but that is only on a par with the difficulties in all\r\nconceptions of matter, space, motion, force, etc. As I understood\r\nSpencer, his physiological units were identical throughout each species,\r\nbut slightly different in each different species; but no attempt was\r\nmade to show how the identical form of the parent or ancestors came to\r\nbe built up of such units.\r\n\r\nThe only parts I have yet met with where I somewhat differ from your\r\nviews are in the chapter on the Causes of Variability, in which I think\r\nseveral of your arguments are unsound: but this is too long a subject to\r\ngo into now.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do not see your objection to _sterility_ between allied species\r\nhaving been aided by Natural Selection. It appears to me that, given a\r\ndifferentiation of a species into two forms, each of which was adapted\r\nto a special sphere of existence, every slight degree of sterility would\r\nbe a positive advantage, not to the _individuals_ who were sterile, but\r\nto _each form_. If you work it out, and suppose the two incipient\r\nspecies A, B to be divided into two groups, one of which contains those\r\nwhich are fertile when the two are crossed, the other being slightly\r\nsterile, you will find that the latter will certainly supplant the\r\nformer in the struggle for existence, remembering that you have shown\r\nthat in such a cross the offspring would be _more vigorous_ than the\r\npure breed, and would therefore certainly soon supplant them, and as\r\nthese would not be so well adapted to any special sphere of existence as\r\nthe pure species A and B, they would certainly in their turn give way to\r\nA and B.\r\n\r\nI am sure all naturalists will be disgusted at the malicious and\r\nignorant article in the _Athenæum_. It is a disgrace to the paper, and I\r\nhope someone will publicly express the general opinion of it. We can\r\nexpect no good reviews of your book till the quarterlies or best\r\nmonthlies come out.... I shall be anxious to see how Pangenesis is\r\nreceived.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. February 27, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--You cannot well imagine how much I have been pleased\r\nby what you say about Pangenesis. None of my friends will speak out,\r\nexcept, to a certain extent, Sir H. Holland,[67] who found it very tough\r\nreading, but admits that some view \"closely akin to it\" will have to be\r\nadmitted. Hooker, as far as I understand him, which I hardly do at\r\npresent, seems to think that the hypothesis is little more than saying\r\nthat organisms have such and such potentialities. What you say exactly\r\nand fully expresses my feeling, viz. that it is a relief to have some\r\nfeasible explanation of the various facts, which can be given up as soon\r\nas any better hypothesis is found. It has certainly been an immense\r\nrelief to my mind; for I have been stumbling over the subject for years,\r\ndimly seeing that some relation existed between the various classes of\r\nfacts. I now hear from H. Spencer that his views quoted in my footnote\r\nrefer to something quite distinct, as you seem to have perceived.\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad to hear, at some future day, your criticisms on the\r\ncauses of variability.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I feel sure that I am right about sterility and Natural\r\nSelection. Two of my grown-up children who are acute reasoners have two\r\nor three times at intervals tried to prove me wrong, and when your\r\nletter came they had another try, but ended by coming back to my side. I\r\ndo not quite understand your case, and we think that a word or two is\r\nmisplaced. I wish some time you would consider the case under the\r\nfollowing point of view. If sterility is caused or accumulated through\r\nNatural Selection, then, as every degree exists up to absolute\r\nbarrenness, Natural Selection must have the power of increasing it. Now\r\ntake two species, A and B, and assume that they are (by any means)\r\nhalf-sterile, i.e. produce half the full number of offspring. Now try\r\nand make (by Natural Selection) A and B absolutely sterile when crossed,\r\nand you will find how difficult it is. I grant, indeed it is certain,\r\nthat the degree of sterility of the individuals of A and B will vary,\r\nbut any such extra-sterile individuals of, we will say, A, if they\r\nshould hereafter breed with other individuals of A, will bequeath no\r\nadvantage to their progeny, by which these families will tend to\r\nincrease in number over other families of A, which are not more sterile\r\nwhen crossed with B. But I do not know that I have made this any clearer\r\nthan in the chapter in my book. It is a most difficult bit of reasoning,\r\nwhich I have gone over and over again on paper with diagrams.\r\n\r\nI shall be intensely curious to see your article in the _Journal of\r\nTravel_.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for such answers as you could give. From what you say I\r\nshould have inferred that birds of paradise were probably polygamous.\r\nBut after all, perhaps it is not so important as I thought. I have been\r\ngoing through the whole animal kingdom in reference to sexual selection,\r\nand I have just got to the beginning of Lepidoptera, i.e. to end of\r\ninsects, and shall then pass on to Vertebrata. But my ladies next week\r\nare going (ill-luck to it) to take me nolens-volens to London for a\r\nwhole month.\r\n\r\nI suspect Owen wrote the article in the _Athenæum_, but I have been told\r\nthat it is Berthold Seeman. The writer despises and hates me.\r\n\r\nHearty thanks for your letter--you have indeed pleased me, for I had\r\ngiven up the great god Pan as a stillborn deity. I wish you could be\r\ninduced to make it clear with your admirable powers of elucidation in\r\none of the scientific journals.\r\n\r\nI think we almost entirely agree about sexual selection, as I now follow\r\nyou to large extent about protection to females, having always believed\r\nthat colour was often transmitted to both sexes; but I do not go quite\r\nso far about protection.--Always yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Hurstpierpoint. March 1, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I beg to enclose what appears to me a demonstration,\r\n_on your own principles_, that Natural Selection _could_ produce\r\n_sterility of hybrids_.\r\n\r\nIf it does not convince you I shall be glad if you will point out where\r\nthe fallacy lies. I have taken the two cases of a slight sterility\r\novercoming a perfect fertility, and of a perfect sterility overcoming a\r\npartial fertility--the beginning and end of the process. You admit that\r\nvariations in fertility and sterility occur, and I think you will also\r\nadmit that if I demonstrate that a considerable amount of sterility\r\nwould be advantageous to a variety, that is sufficient proof that the\r\nslightest variation in that direction would be useful also, and would go\r\non accumulating.\r\n\r\nSir C. Lyell spoke to me as if he greatly admired pangenesis. I am very\r\nglad H. Spencer at once acknowledges that his view was something quite\r\ndistinct from yours. Although, as you know, I am a great admirer of his,\r\nI feel how completely his view failed to go to the root of the matter,\r\nas yours does. His explained nothing, though he was evidently struggling\r\nhard to find an explanation. Yours, as far as I can see, explains\r\neverything in _growth and reproduction_, though of course the mystery of\r\n_life_ and _consciousness_ remains as great as ever.\r\n\r\nParts of the chapter on Pangenesis I found hard reading, and have not\r\nquite mastered yet, and there are also throughout the discussions in\r\nVol. II. many bits of hard reading on minute points which we, who have\r\nnot worked experimentally at cultivation and crossing as you have done,\r\ncan hardly see the importance of, or their bearing on the general\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIf I am asked, I may perhaps write an article on the book for some\r\nperiodical, and if so shall do what I can to make pangenesis\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nI suppose Mrs. Darwin thinks you _must_ have a holiday, after the\r\nenormous labour of bringing out such a book as that. I am sorry I am not\r\nnow staying in town. I shall, however, be up for two days on Thursday,\r\nand shall hope to see you at the Linnean, where Mr. Trimen has a paper\r\non some of his wonderful South African mimetic butterflies.\r\n\r\nI hope this will reach you before you leave.--Believe me yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Hurstpierpoint. March 8, 1868._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I am very sorry your letter came back here while I was\r\ngoing to town, or I should have been very pleased to have seen you.\r\n\r\nTrimen's paper at the Linnean was a very good one, but the only\r\nopponents were Andrew Murray and B. Seeman. The former talked utter\r\nnonsense about the \"harmony of nature\" produced by \"polarisation,\" alike\r\nin \"rocks, plants and animals,\" etc. etc. etc. And Seeman objected that\r\nthere was mimicry among plants, and that our theory would not explain\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLubbock answered them both in his best manner.\r\n\r\nPray take your rest, and put my last notes by till you return to Down,\r\nor let your son discover the fallacies in them.\r\n\r\nWould you like to see the specimens of pupæ of butterflies whose colours\r\nhave changed in accordance with the colour of the surrounding objects?\r\nThey are very curious, and Mr. T.W. Wood, who bred them, would, I am\r\nsure, be delighted to bring them to show you. His address is 89 Stanhope\r\nStreet, Hampstead Road, N.W.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarwin had already written a short note to Wallace expressing a general\r\ndissent from his views.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_4 Chester Place, Regent's Park, N.W. March 17, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Many thanks about Pieridæ. I have no photographs up\r\nhere, but will remember to send one from Down. Should you care to have a\r\nlarge one, of treble or quadruple common size, I will with pleasure send\r\nyou one under glass cover, to any address you like in London, either now\r\nor hereafter. I grieve to say we shall not be here on April 2nd, as we\r\nreturn home on the 31st. In summer I hope that Mrs. Wallace and\r\nyourself will pay us a visit at Down, soon after you return to London;\r\nfor I am sure you will allow me the freedom of an invalid.\r\n\r\nMy paper to-morrow at the Linnean Society is simply to prove, alas! that\r\nprimrose and cowslip are as good species as any in the world, and that\r\nthere is no trustworthy evidence of one producing the other. The only\r\ninteresting point is the frequency of the production of natural hybrids,\r\ni.e. oxlips, and the existence of one kind of oxlip which constitutes a\r\nthird good and distinct species. I do not suppose that I shall be able\r\nto attend the Linnean Society to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have been working hard in collecting facts on sexual selection every\r\nmorning in London, and have done a good deal; but the subject grows more\r\nand more complex, and in many respects more difficult and doubtful. I\r\nhave had grand success this morning in tracing gradational steps by\r\nwhich the peacock tail has been developed: I quite feel as if I had seen\r\na long line of its progenitors.\r\n\r\nI do not feel that I shall grapple with the sterility argument till my\r\nreturn home; I have tried once or twice and it has made my stomach feel\r\nas if it had been placed in a vice. Your paper has driven three of my\r\nchildren half-mad--one sat up to twelve o'clock over it. My second son,\r\nthe mathematician, thinks that you have omitted one almost inevitable\r\ndeduction which apparently would modify the result. He has written out\r\nwhat he thinks, but I have not tried fully to understand him. I suppose\r\nthat you do not care enough about the subject to like to see what he has\r\nwritten?\r\n\r\nI hope your book progresses.\r\n\r\nI am intensely anxious to see your paper in _Murray's Journal_.--My dear\r\nWallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Hurstpierpoint. March 19, 1868._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I should very much value a _large_ photograph of you, and\r\nalso a carte for my album, though it is too bad to ask you for both, as\r\nyou must have so many applicants.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I shall not see you in town, but shall look forward with\r\npleasure to paying you a visit in the summer.\r\n\r\nI am sorry about the Primulas, but I feel sure some such equally good\r\ncase will some day be discovered, for it seems impossible to understand\r\nhow all natural species whatever should have acquired sterility. Closely\r\nallied forms from adjacent islands would, I should think, offer the best\r\nchance of finding good species fertile _inter se_; since even if Natural\r\nSelection induces sterility I do not see how it could affect them, or\r\nwhy they should _always_ be sterile, and varieties _never_.\r\n\r\nI am glad you have got good materials on sexual selection. It is no\r\ndoubt a difficult subject. One difficulty to me is, that I do not see\r\nhow the constant _minute_ variations, which are sufficient for Natural\r\nSelection to work with, could be _sexually_ selected. We seem to require\r\na series of bold and abrupt variations. How can we imagine that an inch\r\nin the tail of a peacock, or a quarter of an inch in that of the bird of\r\nparadise, would be noticed and preferred by the female?\r\n\r\nPray let me see what your son says about the sterility selection\r\nquestion. I am deeply interested in all that concerns the powers of\r\nNatural Selection, but, though I admit there are a few things it cannot\r\ndo, I do not yet believe sterility to be one of them.\r\n\r\nIn case your son has turned his attention to mathematical physics, will\r\nyou ask him to look at the enclosed question, which I have vainly\r\nattempted to get an answer to?--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_4 Chester Place, Regent's Park, N.W. March 19-24, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have sent your query to Cambridge to my son. He\r\nought to answer it, for he got his place of Second Wrangler chiefly by\r\nsolving very difficult problems. I enclose his remarks on two of your\r\nparagraphs: I should like them returned some time, for I have not\r\nstudied them, and let me have your impression.\r\n\r\nI have told E. Edwards to send one of my large photographs to you\r\naddressed to 76-1/2 Westbourne Grove, not to be forwarded. When at home\r\nI will send my carte.\r\n\r\nThe sterility is a most [? puzzling] problem. I can see so far, but I am\r\nhardly willing to admit all your assumptions, and even if they were all\r\nadmitted, the process is so complex and the sterility (as you remark in\r\nyour note) so universal, even with species inhabiting quite distinct\r\ncountries (as I remarked in my chapter), together with the frequency of\r\na difference in reciprocal unions, that I cannot persuade myself that it\r\nhas been gained by Natural Selection, any more than the difficulty of\r\ngrafting distinct genera and the impossibility of grafting distinct\r\nfamilies. You will allow, I suppose, that the capacity of grafting has\r\nnot been directly acquired through Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nI think that you will be pleased with the second volume or part of\r\nLyell's Principles, just out.\r\n\r\nIn regard to sexual selection. A girl sees a handsome man, and without\r\nobserving whether his nose or whiskers are the tenth of an inch longer\r\nor shorter than in some other man, admires his appearance and says she\r\nwill marry him. So, I suppose, with the pea-hen; and the tail has been\r\nincreased in length merely by, on the whole, presenting a more gorgeous\r\nappearance. Jenner Weir, however, has given me some facts showing that\r\nbirds apparently admire details of plumage.--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Hurstpierpoint. March 24, [1868?]._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for the photo, which I shall get when I go to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nI return your son's notes with my notes on them.\r\n\r\nWithout going into any details, is not this a strong general argument?--\r\n\r\n1. A species varies occasionally in two directions, but owing to their\r\nfree intercrossing they (the variations) never increase.\r\n\r\n2. A change of conditions occurs which threatens the existence of the\r\nspecies, but the _two varieties_ are adapted to the changing conditions,\r\nand, if accumulated, will form two new _species adapted to the new\r\nconditions_.\r\n\r\n3. Free crossing, however, renders this impossible, and so the species\r\nis in danger of extinction.\r\n\r\n4. If _sterility_ could be induced, then the pure races would increase\r\nmore rapidly and replace the old species.\r\n\r\n5. It is admitted that _partial sterility_ between _varieties_ does\r\noccasionally occur. It is admitted the _degree_ of this sterility\r\n_varies_. Is it not probable that Natural Selection can accumulate these\r\nvariations and thus save the species?\r\n\r\nIf Natural Selection can _not_ do this, how do species ever arise,\r\nexcept when a variety is isolated?\r\n\r\nClosely allied species in distinct countries being sterile is no\r\ndifficulty, for either they diverged from a common ancestor in contact,\r\nand Natural Selection increased the sterility, or they were isolated,\r\nand have varied since, in which case they have been for ages influenced\r\nby distinct conditions which may well produce sterility.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulty of _grafting_ was as great as the difficulty of\r\n_crossing_, and as _regular_, I admit it would be a most serious\r\nobjection. But it is not. I believe many distinct species can be grafted\r\nwhile others less distinct cannot. The regularity with which natural\r\nspecies are sterile together, even when _very much alike_, I think is an\r\nargument in favour of the sterility having been generally produced by\r\nNatural Selection for the good of the species.\r\n\r\nThe other difficulty, of unequal sterility of reciprocal crosses, seems\r\nnone to me; for it is a step to more complete sterility, and as such\r\nwould be useful and would be increased by selection.\r\n\r\nI have read Sir C. Lyell's second volume with great pleasure. He is, as\r\nusual, very cautious, and hardly ever expresses a positive opinion, but\r\nthe general effect of the whole book is very strong, as the argument is\r\nall on our side.\r\n\r\nI am in hopes it will bring in a new set of converts to Natural\r\nSelection, and will at all events lead to a fresh ventilation of the\r\nsubject.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_4 Chester Place, Regent's Park, N.W. March 27, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--My son has failed in your problem, and says that it is\r\n\"excessively difficult\": he says you will find something about it in\r\nThomson and Tait, \"Natural Philosophy\" (art. 649). He has, however, sent\r\nthe solution, if the plate rested on a square rim, but he supposes this\r\nwill not answer your purpose; nevertheless, I have forwarded it by this\r\nsame post. It seems that the rim being round makes the problem much more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nI enclose my photograph, which I have received from Down. I sent your\r\nanswer to George on his objection to your argument on sterility, but\r\nhave not yet heard from him. I dread beginning to think over this\r\nfearful problem, which I believe beats the plate on the circular rim;\r\nbut I will sometime. I foresee, however, that there are so many doubtful\r\npoints that we shall never agree. As far as a glance serves it seems to\r\nme, perhaps falsely, that you sometimes argue that hybrids have an\r\nadvantage from greater vigour, and sometimes a disadvantage from not\r\nbeing so well fitted to their conditions. Heaven protect my stomach\r\nwhenever I attempt following your argument!--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent. April 6, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have been considering the terrible problem. Let me\r\nfirst say that no man could have more earnestly wished for the success\r\nof Natural Selection in regard to sterility than I did, and when I\r\nconsidered a general statement (as in your last note) I always felt sure\r\nit could be worked out, but always failed in detail, the cause being, as\r\nI believe, that Natural Selection cannot effect what is not good for the\r\nindividual, including in this term a social community. It would take a\r\nvolume to discuss all the points; and nothing is so humiliating to me as\r\nto agree with a man like you (or Hooker) on the premises and disagree\r\nabout the result.\r\n\r\nI agree with my son's argument and not with rejoinder. The cause of our\r\ndifference, I think, is that I look at the number of offspring as an\r\nimportant element (all circumstances remaining the same) in keeping up\r\nthe average number of individuals within any area. I do not believe that\r\nthe amount of food by any means is the sole determining cause of number.\r\nLessened fertility is equivalent to a new source of destruction. I\r\nbelieve if in one district a species produce _from any cause_ fewer\r\nyoung, the deficiency would be supplied from surrounding districts. This\r\napplies to your par. 5. If the species produced fewer young from any\r\ncause in _every_ district, it would become extinct unless its fertility\r\nwere augmented through Natural Selection (_see_ H. Spencer).\r\n\r\nI demur to the probability and almost to the possibility of par. 1, as\r\nyou start with two forms, within the same area, which are not mutually\r\nsterile, and which yet have supplanted the parent-form (par. 6). I know\r\nof no ghost of a fact supporting belief that disinclination to cross\r\naccompanies sterility. It cannot hold with plants, or the lower fixed\r\naquatic animals. I saw clearly what an immense aid this would be, but\r\ngave it up. Disinclination to cross seems to have been independently\r\nacquired, probably by Natural Selection; and I do not see why it would\r\nnot have sufficed to have prevented incipient species from blending to\r\nhave simply increased sexual disinclination to cross.\r\n\r\nPar. 11: I demur to a certain extent to amount of sterility and\r\nstructural dissimilarity necessarily going together, except indirectly\r\nand by no means strictly. Look at the case of pigeons, fowls, and\r\ncabbages.\r\n\r\nI overlooked the advantage of the half-sterility of reciprocal crosses;\r\nyet, perhaps from novelty, I do not feel inclined to admit the\r\nprobability of Natural Selection having done its work so clearly.\r\n\r\nI will not discuss the second case of utter sterility; but your\r\nassumptions in par. 13 seem to me much too complicated. I cannot believe\r\nso universal an attribute as utter sterility between remote species was\r\nacquired in so complex a manner. I do not agree with your rejoinder on\r\ngrafting; I fully admit that it is not so closely restricted as\r\ncrossing; but this does not seem to me to weaken the case as one of\r\nanalogy. The incapacity of grafting is likewise an invariable attribute\r\nof plants sufficiently remote from each other, and sometimes of plants\r\npretty closely allied.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of increasing the sterility, through Natural Selection,\r\nof two already sterile species seems to me best brought home by\r\nconsidering an actual case. The cowslip and primrose are moderately\r\nsterile, yet occasionally produce hybrids: now these hybrids, two or\r\nthree or a dozen in a whole parish, occupy ground which _might_ have\r\nbeen occupied by either pure species, and no doubt the latter suffer to\r\nthis small extent. But can you conceive that any individual plants of\r\nthe primrose and cowslip, which happened to be mutually rather more\r\nsterile (i.e. which when crossed yielded a few less seeds) than usual,\r\nwould profit to such a degree as to increase in number to the ultimate\r\nexclusion of the present primrose and cowslip? I cannot.\r\n\r\nMy son, I am sorry to say, cannot see the full force of your rejoinder\r\nin regard to the second head of continually augmented sterility. You\r\nspeak in this rejoinder, and in par. 5, of all the individuals becoming\r\nin some slight degree sterile in certain districts; if you were to admit\r\nthat by continued exposure to these same conditions the sterility would\r\ninevitably increase, there would be no need of Natural Selection. But I\r\nsuspect that the sterility is not caused so much by any particular\r\nconditions, as by long habituation to conditions of any kind. To speak\r\naccording to pangenesis, the gemmules of hybrids are not injured, for\r\nhybrids propagate freely by buds; but their reproductive organs are\r\nsomehow affected, so that they cannot accumulate the proper gemmules, in\r\nnearly the same manner as the reproductive organs of a pure species\r\nbecome affected when exposed to unnatural conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is a very ill-expressed and ill-written letter. Do not answer it,\r\nunless the spirit urges you. Life is too short for so long a discussion.\r\nWe shall, I _greatly_ fear, never agree.--My dear Wallace, most\r\nsincerely yours,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Hurstpierpoint. [?] April 8, 1868._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I am sorry you should have given yourself the trouble to\r\nanswer my ideas on Sterility. If you are not convinced, I have little\r\ndoubt but that I am wrong; and in fact I was only _half convinced_ by my\r\nown arguments, and I now think there is about an even chance that\r\nNatural Selection may or not be able to accumulate sterility. If my\r\nfirst proposition is modified to _the existence of a species and a\r\nvariety in the same area_, it will do just as well for my argument. Such\r\ncertainly do exist. They are fertile together, and yet each maintains\r\nitself tolerably distinct. How can this be, if there is no\r\ndisinclination to crossing? My belief certainly is that number of\r\noffspring is not so important an element in keeping up population of a\r\nspecies as supply of food and other favourable conditions, because the\r\nnumbers of a species constantly vary greatly in different parts of its\r\narea, whereas the average number of offspring is not a very variable\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will say no more but leave the problem as insoluble, only\r\nfearing that it will become a formidable weapon in the hands of the\r\nenemies of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nWhile writing a few pages on the northern alpine forms of plants on the\r\nJava mountains I wanted a few cases to refer to like Teneriffe, where\r\nthere are no _northern_ forms, and scarcely any alpine. I expected the\r\nvolcanoes of Hawaii would be a good case, and asked Dr. Seeman about\r\nthem. It seems a man has lately published a list of Hawaiian plants, and\r\nthe mountains swarm with European alpine genera and some species![68] Is\r\nnot this most extraordinary and a puzzler? They are, I believe, truly\r\noceanic islands in the absence of mammals and the extreme poverty of\r\nbirds and insects, and they are within the tropics. Will not that be a\r\nhard nut for you when you come to treat in detail on geographical\r\ndistribution?\r\n\r\nI enclose Seeman's note, which please return when you have copied the\r\nlist, if of any use to you.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your carte, which I think very good. The large one had\r\nnot arrived when I was in town last week.\r\n\r\nSir C. Lyell's chapter on Oceanic Islands I think very good.--Believe\r\nme, dear Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. April 9, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--You allude in your note to several points which I\r\nshould much enjoy discussing with you did time and strength permit. I\r\nknow Dr. Seeman is a good botanist, but I most strongly advise you to\r\nshow the list to Hooker before you make use of the materials in print.\r\nHooker seems much overworked, and is now gone a tour, but I suppose you\r\nwill be in town before very long, and could see him. The list is quite\r\nunintelligible to me; it is not pretended that the same species exist in\r\nthe Sandwich Islands and Arctic regions; and as far as the genera are\r\nconcerned, I know that in almost every one of them species inhabit such\r\ncountries as Florida, North Africa, New Holland, etc. Therefore these,\r\ngenera seem to me almost mundane, and their presence in the Sandwich\r\nIslands will not, as I suspect in my ignorance, show any relation to the\r\nArctic regions. The Sandwich Islands, though I have never considered\r\nthem much, have long been a sore perplexity to me: they are eminently\r\noceanic in position and productions; they have long been separated from\r\neach other; and there are only slight signs of subsidence in the islets\r\nto the westward. I remember, however, speculating that there must have\r\nbeen some immigration during the glacial period from North America or\r\nJapan; but I cannot remember what my grounds were. Some of the plants, I\r\nthink, show an affinity with Australia. I am very glad that you like\r\nLyell's chapter on Oceanic Islands, for I thought it one of the best in\r\nthe part which I have read. If you do not receive the big photo of me in\r\ndue time, let me hear.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following refers to Wallace's article, \"A Theory of Birds' Nests,\"\r\nin Andrew Murray's _Journal of Travel_, i. 73. He here treats in fuller\r\ndetail the view already published in the _Westminster Review_ for July,\r\n1867, p. 38. The rule which Wallace believes, with very few exceptions,\r\nto hold good is, \"that when both sexes are of strikingly gay and\r\nconspicuous colours, the nest is ... such as to conceal the sitting\r\nbird; while, whenever there is a striking contrast of colours, the male\r\nbeing gay and conspicuous, the female dull and obscure, the nest is open\r\nand the sitting bird exposed to view.\" At this time Wallace allowed\r\nconsiderably more influence to _sexual_ selection (in combination with\r\nthe need of protection) than in his later writings. See his letter to\r\nDarwin of July 23, 1877 (p. 298), which fixes the period at which the\r\nchange in his views occurred. He finally rejected Darwin's theory that\r\ncolours \"have been developed by the preference of the females, the more\r\nornamented males becoming the parents of each successive generation.\"\r\n(_See_ \"Darwinism,\" 1889, p. 285.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. April 15, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have been deeply interested by your admirable\r\narticle on Birds' Nests. I am delighted to see that we really differ\r\nvery little--not more than two men almost always will. You do not lay\r\nmuch or any stress on new characters spontaneously appearing in one sex\r\n(generally the male) and being transmitted exclusively, or more commonly\r\nonly in excess, to that sex. I, on the other hand, formerly paid far too\r\nlittle attention to protection. I had only a glimpse of the truth. But\r\neven now I do not go quite as far as you. I cannot avoid thinking rather\r\nmore than you do about the exceptions in nesting to the rule, especially\r\nthe partial exceptions, i.e. when there is some little difference\r\nbetween the sexes in species which build concealed nests. I am now quite\r\nsatisfied about the incubating males; there is so little difference in\r\nconspicuousness between the sexes. I wish with all my heart I could go\r\nthe whole length with you. You seem to think that such birds probably\r\nselect the most beautiful females: I must feel some doubt on this head,\r\nfor I can find no evidence of it. Though I am writing so carping a note,\r\nI admire the article _thoroughly_.\r\n\r\nAnd now I want to ask a question. When female butterflies are more\r\nbrilliant than their males, you believe that they have in most cases, or\r\nin all cases, been rendered brilliant so as to mimic some other species\r\nand thus escape danger. But can you account for the males not having\r\nbeen rendered equally brilliant and equally protected? Although it may\r\nbe most for the welfare of the species that the female should be\r\nprotected, yet it would be some advantage, certainly no disadvantage,\r\nfor the unfortunate male to enjoy an equal immunity from danger. For my\r\npart, I should say that the female alone had happened to vary in the\r\nright manner, and that the beneficial variations had been transmitted to\r\nthe same sex alone. Believing in this, I can see no improbability (but\r\nfrom analogy of domestic animals a strong probability): the variations\r\nleading to beauty must _often_ have occurred in the males alone, and\r\nbeen transmitted to that sex alone. Thus I should account in many cases\r\nfor the greater beauty of the male over the female, without the need of\r\nthe protective principle. I should be grateful for an answer on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nI hope that your Eastern book progresses well.--My dear Wallace, yours\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Clifford Allbutt's view, referred to in the following letter,\r\nprobably had reference to the fact that the sperm-cell goes, or is\r\ncarried, to the germ-cell, never vice versa. In this letter Darwin gives\r\nthe reason for the \"law\" referred to. Wallace has been good enough to\r\nsupply the following note (May 27, 1902): \"It was at this time that my\r\npaper on 'Protective Resemblance' first appeared in the _Westminster\r\nReview_, in which I adduced the greater, or, rather, the more\r\ncontinuous, importance of the female (in the lower animals) for the\r\nrace, and my 'Theory of Birds' Nests' (_Journal of Travel and Natural\r\nHistory_, No. 2), in which I applied this to the usually dull colours of\r\nfemale butterflies and birds. It is to these articles, as well as to my\r\nletters, that Darwin chiefly refers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. April 30, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Your letter, like so many previous ones, has\r\ninterested me much. Dr. Allbutt's view occurred to me some time ago, and\r\nI have written a short discussion on it. It is, I think, a remarkable\r\nlaw, to which I have found no exception. The foundation lies in the fact\r\nthat in many cases the eggs or seeds require nourishment and protection\r\nby the mother-form for some time after impregnation. Hence the\r\nspermatozoa and antherozoids travel in the lower aquatic animals and\r\nplants to the female, and pollen is borne to the female organ. As\r\norganisms rise in the scale it seems natural that the male should carry\r\nthe spermatozoa to the females in his own body. As the male is the\r\nsearcher he has received and gained more eager passions than the female;\r\nand, very differently from you, I look at this as _one_ great difficulty\r\nin believing that the males select the more attractive females; as far\r\nas I can discover they are always ready to seize on any female, and\r\nsometimes on many females. Nothing would please me more than to find\r\nevidence of males selecting the more attractive females [? _in\r\npigeons_[69]]: I have for months been trying to persuade myself of this.\r\nThere is the case of man in favour of this belief, and I know in hybrid\r\n[_lizards'_[69]] unions of males preferring particular females, but alas!\r\nnot guided by colour. Perhaps I may get more evidence as I wade through\r\nmy twenty years' mass of notes.\r\n\r\nI am not shaken about the female protected butterflies: I will grant\r\n(only for argument) that the life of the male is of _very_ little value;\r\nI will grant that the males do not vary; yet why has not the protective\r\nbeauty of the female been transferred by inheritance to the male? The\r\nbeauty would be a gain to the male, as far as we can see, as a\r\nprotection; and I cannot believe that it would be repulsive to the\r\nfemale as she became beautiful. But we shall never convince each other.\r\nI sometimes marvel how truth progresses, so difficult is it for one man\r\nto convince another unless his mind is vacant. Nevertheless, I myself to\r\na certain extent contradict my own remark; for I believe _far more_ in\r\nthe importance of protection than I did before reading your articles.\r\n\r\nI do not think you lay nearly stress enough in your articles on what you\r\nadmit in your letter, viz. \"there seems to be some production of\r\nvividness ... of colour in the male independent of protection.\" This I\r\nam making a chief point; and have come to your conclusion so far that I\r\nbelieve that intense colouring in the female sex is often checked by\r\nbeing dangerous.\r\n\r\nThat is an excellent remark of yours about no known case of the male\r\n_alone_ assuming protective colours; but in the cases in which\r\nprotection has been gained by dull colours, I presume that sexual\r\nselection would interfere with the male losing his beauty. If the male\r\nalone had acquired beauty as a protection, it would be most readily\r\noverlooked, as males are so often more beautiful than their females.\r\nMoreover, I grant that the loss of the male is somewhat less precious\r\nand thus there would be less rigorous selection with the male, so he\r\nwould be less likely to be made beautiful through Natural Selection for\r\nprotection. (This does not apply to sexual selection, for the greater\r\nthe excess of males and the less precious their lives, so much the\r\nbetter for sexual selection.) But it seems to me a good argument, and\r\nvery good if it could be thoroughly established.--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether you will care to read this scrawl.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I heard yesterday that my photograph had been sent to your London\r\naddress--Westbourne Grove.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. May 5, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I am afraid I have caused you a great deal of trouble\r\nin writing to me at such length. I am glad to say that I agree almost\r\nentirely with your summary, except that I should put sexual selection as\r\nan equal or perhaps as even a more important agent in giving colour than\r\nnatural selection for protection. As I get on in my work I hope to get\r\nclearer and more decided ideas. Working up from the bottom of the scale\r\nI have as yet only got to fishes. What I rather object to in your\r\narticles is that I do not think anyone would infer from them that you\r\nplace sexual selection even as high as No. 4 in your summary. It was\r\nvery natural that you should give only a line to sexual selection in\r\nthe summary to the _Westminster Review_, but the result at first to my\r\nmind was that you attributed hardly anything to its power. In your\r\npenultimate note you say: \"In the great mass of cases in which there is\r\n_great_ differentiation of colour between the sexes, I believe it is due\r\n_almost wholly_ to the need of protection to the female.\" Now, looking\r\nto the whole animal kingdom I can at present by no means admit this\r\nview; but pray do not suppose that because I differ to a certain extent,\r\nI do not thoroughly admire your several papers and your admirable\r\ngeneralisation on birds' nests. With respect to this latter point,\r\nhowever, although following you, I suspect that I shall ultimately look\r\nat the whole case from a rather different point of view.\r\n\r\nYou ask what I think about the gay-coloured females of Pieris:[70] I\r\nbelieve I quite follow you in believing that the colours are wholly due\r\nto mimicry; and I further believe that the male is not brilliant from\r\nnot having received through inheritance colour from the female, and from\r\nnot himself having varied; in short, that he has not been influenced by\r\nSelection.\r\n\r\nI can make no answer with respect to the elephants. With respect to the\r\nfemale reindeer, I have hitherto looked at the horns simply as the\r\nconsequence of inheritance _not_ having been limited by sex.\r\n\r\nYour idea about colour being concentrated in the smaller males seems\r\ngood, and I presume that you will not object to my giving it as your\r\nsuggestion.--Believe me, my dear Wallace, with many thanks, yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWallace's more recent views on the question of Natural Selection and\r\nSterility may be found in a note written by him in 1899: \"When writing\r\nmy 'Darwinism' and coming again to the consideration of the problem of\r\nthe effect of Natural Selection in accumulating variations in the amount\r\nof sterility between varieties or incipient species, twenty years later,\r\nI became more convinced than I was when discussing with Darwin, of the\r\nsubstantial accuracy of my argument. Recently a correspondent who is\r\nboth a naturalist and a mathematician has pointed out to me a slight\r\nerror in my calculation at p, 183 (which does not, however, materially\r\naffect the result) disproving the physiological selection of the late\r\nDr. Romanes, but he can see no fallacy in my argument as to the power of\r\nNatural Selection to increase sterility between incipient species, nor,\r\nso far as I am aware, has anyone shown such fallacy to exist.\r\n\r\n\"On the other points on which I differed from Mr. Darwin in the\r\nforegoing discussion--the effect of high fertility on population of a\r\nspecies, etc.--I still hold the views I then expressed, but it would be\r\nout of place to attempt to justify them here.\"--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. August 16, [1868?]._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I ought to have written before to thank you for the copies\r\nof your paper on \"Primula\" and on \"Cross Unions of Dimorphic Plants,\r\netc.\" The latter is particularly interesting, and the conclusion most\r\nimportant; but I think it makes the difficulty of _how_ these forms,\r\nwith their varying degrees of sterility, originated, greater than ever.\r\nIf Natural Selection could not accumulate varying degrees of sterility\r\nfor the plant's benefit, then how did sterility ever come to be\r\nassociated with _one cross_ of a trimorphic plant rather than another?\r\nThe difficulty seems to be increased by the consideration that the\r\nadvantage of a cross with a _distinct individual_ is gained just as well\r\nby illegitimate as by legitimate unions. By what means, then, did\r\nillegitimate unions ever become sterile? It would seem a far simpler way\r\nfor each plant's pollen to have acquired a prepotency on another\r\nindividual's stigma over that of the same individual, without the\r\nextraordinary complication of three differences of structure and\r\neighteen different unions with varying degrees of sterility!\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact remains an excellent answer to the statement that\r\nsterility of hybrids proves the absolute distinctness of the parents.\r\n\r\nI have been reading with great pleasure Mr. Bentham's last admirable\r\naddress,[71] in which he so well replies to the gross misstatements of\r\nthe _Athenæum_; and also says a word in favour of pangenesis. I think we\r\nmay now congratulate you on having made a valuable convert, whose\r\nopinions on the subject, coming so late and being evidently so well\r\nconsidered, will have much weight.\r\n\r\nI am going to Norwich on Tuesday to hear Dr. Hooker, who I hope will\r\nboldly promulgate \"Darwinianism\" in his address. Shall we have the\r\npleasure of seeing you there?\r\n\r\nI am engaged in negotiations about my book.\r\n\r\nHoping you are well and getting on with your next volumes, believe me\r\nyours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

I did sometimes think of going\r\nto Norwich, for I should have very much liked it, but it has been quite\r\nout of the question. We have been here for five weeks for a change, and\r\nit has done me some little good; but I have been forced to live the life\r\nof a drone, and for a month before leaving home I was unable to do\r\nanything and had to stop all work.\r\n\r\nWe return to Down to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHooker has been here for two or three days, so that I have had much\r\ntalk about his Address. I am glad that you will be there.\r\n\r\nIt is real good news that your book is so advanced that you are\r\nnegotiating about its publication.\r\n\r\nWith respect to dimorphic plants: it is a great puzzle, but I _fancy_ I\r\npartially see my way--too long for a letter and too speculative for\r\npublication. The groundwork of the acquirement of such peculiar\r\nfertility (for what you say about any other distinct individual being,\r\nas it would appear, sufficient, is very true) rests on the stamens and\r\npistil having varied first in relative length, _as actually occurs_\r\nirrespective of dimorphism, and the peculiar kind of fertility\r\ncharacteristic of dimorphic and the trimorphic plants having been\r\n_secondarily_ acquired. Pangenesis makes _very_ few converts: G.H. Lewes\r\nis one.\r\n\r\nI had become, before my nine weeks' horrid interruption of all work,\r\nextremely interested in sexual selection and was making fair progress.\r\nIn truth, it has vexed me much to find that the further I get on, the\r\nmore I differ from you about the females being dull-coloured for\r\nprotection. I can now hardly express myself as strongly even as in the\r\n\"Origin.\" This has _much decreased_ the pleasure of my work.\r\n\r\nIn the course of September, if I can get at all stronger, I hope to get\r\nMr. J. Jenner Weir (who has been _wonderfully_ kind in giving me\r\ninformation) to pay me a visit, and I will then write for the chance of\r\nyour being able to come and, I hope, bring with you Mrs. Wallace. If I\r\ncould get several of you together, it would be less dull for you, for of\r\nlate I have found it impossible to talk with any human being for more\r\nthan half an hour, except on extraordinarily good days.--Believe me, my\r\ndear Wallace, ever yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH.

August 30, [1868?]._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I was very sorry to hear you had been so unwell again, and\r\nhope you will not exert yourself to write me such long letters.\r\nDarwinianism was in the ascendant at Norwich (I hope you do not dislike\r\nthe word, for we really _must_ use it), and I think it rather disgusted\r\nsome of the parsons, joined with the amount of _advice_ they received\r\nfrom Hooker and Huxley. The worst of it is that there are no opponents\r\nleft who know anything of natural history, so that there are none of the\r\ngood discussions we used to have. G.H. Lewes seems to me to be making a\r\ngreat mistake in the _Fortnightly_, advocating _many distinct_ origins\r\nfor different groups, and even, if I understand him, distinct origins\r\nfor some allied groups, just as the anthropologists do who make the red\r\nman descend from the orang, the black man from the chimpanzee--or rather\r\nthe Malay and orang one ancestor, the negro and chimpanzee another. Vogt\r\ntold me that the Germans are all becoming converted by your last book.\r\n\r\nI am certainly surprised that you should find so much evidence against\r\nprotection having checked the acquirement of bright colour in females;\r\nbut I console myself by presumptuously hoping that I can explain your\r\nfacts, unless they are derived from the very groups on which I chiefly\r\nrest--birds and insects. There is nothing _necessarily_ requiring\r\nprotection in females; it is a matter of habits. There are groups in\r\nwhich both sexes require protection in an exactly equal degree, and\r\nothers (I think) in which the male requires most protection, and I feel\r\nthe greatest confidence that these will ultimately support my view,\r\nalthough I do _not_ yet know the facts they may afford.\r\n\r\nHoping you are in better health, believe me, dear Darwin, yours\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

I shall wait till my son Frank returns, before soaking\r\nand examining them. I long to steal the box, but return it by this post,\r\nlike a too honest man.\r\n\r\nI am so much pleased about the male musk Callichroma; for by odd chance\r\nI told Frank a week ago that next spring he must collect at Cambridge\r\nlots of Cerambyx moschatus, for as sure as life he would find the odour\r\nsexual!\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased to hear that I am undergoing severe distress about\r\nprotection and sexual selection: this morning I oscillated with joy\r\ntowards you; this evening I have swung back to the old position, out of\r\nwhich I fear I shall never get.\r\n\r\nI did most thoroughly enjoy my talk with you three gentlemen, and\r\nespecially with you, and to my great surprise it has not knocked me up.\r\nPray give my kindest remembrances to Mrs. Wallace, and if my wife were\r\nat home she would cordially join in this.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI have had this morning a capital letter from Walsh of Illinois; but\r\ndetails too long to give.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong Wallace's papers was found the following draft of a letter of his\r\nto Darwin:\r\n\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. September 18, 1868._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--The more I think of your views as to the colours of\r\nfemales, the more difficulty I find in accepting them, and as you are\r\nnow working at the subject I hope it will not interrupt you to hear\r\n\"counsel on the other side.\"\r\n\r\nI have a \"general\" and a \"special\" argument to submit.\r\n\r\n1. Female birds and insects are generally exposed to more danger than\r\nthe male, and in the case of insects their existence is necessary for a\r\nlonger period.\r\n\r\n2. They therefore require in some way or other a special balance of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n3. Now, if the male and female were distinct species, with different\r\nhabits and organisations, you would, I think, at once admit that a\r\ndifference of colour serving to make that one less conspicuous which\r\nevidently required more protection than the other had been acquired by\r\nNatural Selection.\r\n\r\n4. But you admit that variations appearing in one sex are transmitted\r\n(often) to that sex only: there is therefore nothing to prevent Natural\r\nSelection acting on the two sexes as if they were two species.\r\n\r\n5. Your objection that the same protection would to a certain extent be\r\nuseful to the male, seems to me utterly unsound, and directly opposed to\r\nyour own doctrine so convincingly urged in the \"Origin,\" \"_that Natural\r\nSelection never can improve an animal beyond its needs_.\" So that\r\nadmitting abundant variation of colour in the male, it is impossible\r\nthat he can be brought by Natural Selection to resemble the female\r\n(unless _her_ variations are always transmitted to _him_), because the\r\n_difference_ of their colours is to balance the _difference_ in their\r\norganisations and habits, and Natural Selection cannot give to the male\r\n_more_ than is needed to effect that balance.\r\n\r\n6. The fact that in almost all protected groups the females perfectly\r\nresemble the males shows, I think, a tendency to transference of colour\r\nfrom one sex to the other when this tendency is not injurious.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps the _protection_ is acquired because this tendency exists. I\r\nadmit therefore in the case of concealed nests they [habits] may have\r\nbeen acquired for protection.\r\n\r\nNow for the special case.\r\n\r\n7. In the very weak-flying Leptalis both sexes mimic Heliconidæ.\r\n\r\n8. In the much more powerful Papilio, Pieris, and Diadema it is\r\ngenerally the _female only_ that mimics Danaida.\r\n\r\n9. In these cases the females often acquire more bright and varied\r\ncolours than the male. Sometimes, as in _Pieris pyrrha_, conspicuously\r\nso.\r\n\r\n10. No single case is known of a male Papilio, Pieris, Diadema (or any\r\nother insect?) _alone_ mimicking a Danais, etc.\r\n\r\n11. But colour is more frequent in males, and _variations_ always seem\r\nready for purposes of sexual or other selection.\r\n\r\n12. The fair inference seems to be that given in proposition 5 of the\r\ngeneral argument, viz. that _each species_ and _each sex_ can only be\r\nmodified by selection just as far as is absolutely necessary, not a step\r\nfarther. A male, being by structure and habits less exposed to danger\r\nand less requiring protection than the female, cannot have more\r\nprotection given to it by Natural Selection, but a female must have some\r\nextra protection to balance the greater danger, and she rapidly acquires\r\nit in one way or another.\r\n\r\n13. An objection derived from cases like male fish, which seem to\r\nrequire protection, yet having brighter colours, seems to me of no more\r\nweight than is that of the existence of many white and unprotected\r\nspecies of Leptalis to Bates's theory of mimicry, that only one or two\r\nspecies of butterflies perfectly resemble leaves, or that the instincts\r\nor habits or colours that seem essential to the preservation of one\r\nanimal are often totally absent in an allied species.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent. September 23, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I am very much obliged for all your trouble in writing\r\nme your long letter, which I will keep by me and ponder over. To answer\r\nit would require at least 200 folio pages! If you could see how often I\r\nhave rewritten some pages, you would know how anxious I am to arrive as\r\nnear as I can to the truth. We differ, I think, chiefly from fixing our\r\nminds perhaps too closely on different points, on which we agree: I lay\r\ngreat stress on what I know takes place under domestication: I think we\r\nstart with different fundamental notions on inheritance. I find it most\r\ndifficult, but not, I think, impossible, to see how, for instance, a few\r\nred feathers appearing on the head of a male bird, and which _are at\r\nfirst transmitted to both sexes_, could come to be transmitted to males\r\nalone;[72] but I have no difficulty in making the whole head red if the\r\nfew red feathers in the male from the first tended to be sexually\r\ntransmitted. I am quite willing to admit that the female may have been\r\nmodified, either at the same time or subsequently, for protection, by\r\nthe accumulation of variations limited in their transmission to the\r\nfemale sex. I owe to your writings the consideration of this latter\r\npoint. But I cannot yet persuade myself that females _alone_ have often\r\nbeen modified for protection. Should you grudge the trouble briefly to\r\ntell me whether you believe that the plainer head and less bright\r\n_colours_ of [female symbol][73] chaffinch, the less red on the head and\r\nless clean colours of [female symbol] goldfinch, the much less red on\r\nbreast of [female symbol] bullfinch, the paler crest of goldencrest\r\nwren, etc., have been acquired by them for protection? I cannot think\r\nso; any more than I can that the considerable differences between\r\n[female symbol] and [male symbol] house-sparrow, or much greater\r\nbrightness of [male symbol] _Parus cæruleus_ (both of which build under\r\ncover) than of [female symbol] Parus are related to protection. I even\r\nmisdoubt much whether the less blackness of blackbird is for protection.\r\n\r\nAgain, can you give me reason for believing that the merest differences\r\nbetween female pheasants, the female _Gallus bankiva_, the female of\r\nblack grouse, the pea-hen, female partridge, have all special reference\r\nto protection under slightly different conditions? I of course admit\r\nthat they are all protected by dull colours, derived, as I think, from\r\nsome dull-ground progenitor; and I account partly for their difference\r\nby partial transference of colour from the male, and by other means too\r\nlong to specify; but I earnestly wish to see reason to believe that each\r\nis specially adapted for concealment to its environment.\r\n\r\nI grieve to differ from you, and it actually terrifies me, and makes me\r\nconstantly distrust myself.\r\n\r\nI fear we shall never quite understand each other. I value the cases of\r\nbright-coloured, incubating male fishes--and brilliant female\r\nbutterflies, solely as showing that one sex may be made brilliant\r\nwithout any necessary transference of beauty to the other sex; for in\r\nthese cases I cannot suppose that beauty in the other sex was checked by\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nI fear this letter will trouble you to read it. A very short answer\r\nabout your belief in regard to the [female symbol] finches and\r\nGallinaceæ would suffice.--Believe me, my dear Wallace, yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, S.W. September 27, 1868._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Your view seems to be that variations occurring in one sex\r\nare transmitted either to that sex exclusively or to both sexes equally,\r\nor more rarely partially transferred. But we have every gradation of\r\nsexual colours from total dissimilarity to perfect identity. If this is\r\nexplained solely by the laws of inheritance, then the colours of one or\r\nother sex will be always (in relation to their environment) a _matter of\r\nchance_. I cannot think this. I think Selection more powerful than laws\r\nof inheritance, of which it makes use, as shown by cases of two, three\r\nor four forms of female butterflies, all of which have, I have little\r\ndoubt, been specialised for protection.\r\n\r\nTo answer your first question is most difficult, if not impossible,\r\nbecause we have no sufficient evidence in _individual cases of slight\r\nsexual difference_, to determine whether the male alone has acquired his\r\nsuperior brightness by sexual selection, or the female been made duller\r\nby need of protection, or whether the two causes have acted. Many of the\r\nsexual differences of existing species may be inherited differences from\r\nparent forms who existed under different conditions and had greater or\r\nless need of protection.\r\n\r\nI think I admitted before the general tendency (probably) of males to\r\nacquire brighter tints. Yet this cannot be universal, for many female\r\nbirds and quadrupeds have equally bright tints.\r\n\r\nI think the case of [female symbol] _Pieris pyrrha_ proves that females\r\nalone can be greatly modified for protection.\r\n\r\nTo your second question I can reply more decidedly. I do think the\r\nfemales of the Gallmaceæ you mention have been modified or been\r\nprevented from acquiring the brighter plumage of the male by need of\r\nprotection. I know that the _Gallus bankiva_ frequents drier and more\r\nopen situations than the pea-hen of Java, which is found among grassy\r\nand leafy vegetation corresponding with the colours of the two. So the\r\nArgus pheasant, [male symbol] and [female symbol], are, I feel sure,\r\nprotected by their tints corresponding to the dead leaves of the lofty\r\nforest in which they dwell, and the female of the gorgeous fire-back\r\npheasant, _Lophura viellottii_, is of a very similar _rich brown\r\ncolour_. I do not, however, at all think the question can be settled by\r\nindividual cases, but only by large masses of facts.\r\n\r\nThe colours of the mass of female birds seem to me strictly analogous to\r\nthe colours of both sexes of snipes, woodcocks, plovers, etc., which are\r\nundoubtedly protective.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing, on your view, that the colours of a male bird become\r\nmore and more brilliant by sexual selection, and a good deal of that\r\ncolour is transmitted to the female till it becomes positively injurious\r\nto her during incubation and the race is in danger of extinction, do you\r\nnot think that all the females who had acquired less of the male's\r\nbright colours or who themselves varied in a protective direction would\r\nbe preserved, and that thus a good protective colouring would be\r\nacquired? If you admit that this could occur, and can show no good\r\nreason why it should not often occur, then we no longer differ, for this\r\nis the main point of my view.\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought of the red wax-tips of the Bombycilla beautifully\r\nimitating the red fructification of lichens used in the nest, and\r\ntherefore the females have it too? Yet this is a very sexual-looking\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWe begin printing this week.--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Pray don't distress yourself on this subject. It will all come\r\nright in the end, and after all it is only an episode in your great\r\nwork.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. October 4, 1868._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I should have answered your letter before, but have been\r\nvery busy reading over my MSS. the last time before going to press,\r\ndrawing maps, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nYour first question cannot be answered, because we have not, in\r\n_individual cases_ of _slight sexual_ difference, sufficient evidence to\r\ndetermine how much of that difference is due to sexual selection acting\r\non the male, how much to natural selection (protective) acting on the\r\nfemale, or how much of the difference may be due to inherited\r\ndifferences from ancestors who lived under different conditions. On your\r\nsecond question I can give an opinion. I do think the females of the\r\nGallinaceæ you mention have been either _modified_; or _prevented from\r\nacquiring much of the brighter plumage of the males_, by the need of\r\nprotection. I know that _Gallus bankiva_ frequents drier and more open\r\nsituations than _Pavo muticus_, which in Java is found among grassy and\r\nleafy vegetation corresponding with the colours of the two females. So\r\nthe Argus pheasants, male and female, are, I feel sure, protected by\r\ntheir tints corresponding to dead leaves of the dry lofty forests in\r\nwhich they dwell; and the female of the gorgeous fire-back pheasant,\r\n_Lophura viellottii_, is of a very similar rich brown colour.\r\n\r\nThese and many other colours of female birds seem to me exactly\r\nanalogous to the colours of _both sexes_ in such groups as the snipes,\r\nwoodcocks, plovers, ptarmigan, desert birds, Arctic animals, greenbirds.\r\n\r\n[The second page of this letter has been torn off. This letter and that\r\nof September 27 appear both to answer the same letter from Darwin. The\r\nlast page of this or of another letter was placed with it in the\r\nportfolio of letters; it is now given.]\r\n\r\nI am sorry to find that our difference of opinion on this point is a\r\nsource of anxiety to you.\r\n\r\nPray do not let it be so. The truth will come out at last, and our\r\ndifference may be the means of setting others to work who may set us\r\nboth right.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this question is only an episode (though an important one) in\r\nthe great question of the origin of species, and whether you or I are\r\nright will not at all affect the main doctrine--that is one comfort.\r\n\r\nI hope you will publish your treatise on Sexual Selection as a separate\r\nbook as soon as possible, and then while you are going on with your\r\nother work, there will no doubt be found someone to battle with me over\r\nyour facts, on this hard problem.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes and kind regards to Mrs. Darwin and all your family,\r\nbelieve me, dear Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. October 6, 1868._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Your letter is very valuable to me, and in every way\r\nvery kind. I will not inflict a long answer, but only answer your\r\nqueries. There are breeds (viz. Hamburgh) in which both sexes differ\r\nmuch from each other and from both sexes of _G. bankiva_; and both sexes\r\nare kept constant by selection.\r\n\r\nThe comb of Spanish [male symbol] has been ordered to be upright and\r\nthat of Spanish [female symbol] to lop over, and this has been effected.\r\nThere are sub-breeds of game fowl, with [female symbol]s very distinct\r\nand [male symbol]s almost identical; but this apparently is the result\r\nof spontaneous variation without special selection.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear of the case of [female symbol] birds of paradise.\r\n\r\nI have never in the least doubted the possibility of modifying female\r\nbirds _alone_ for protection; and I have long believed it for\r\nbutterflies: I have wanted only evidence for the females alone of birds\r\nhaving had their colours modified for protection. But then I believe\r\nthat the variations by which a female bird or butterfly could get or has\r\ngot protective colouring have probably from the first been variations\r\nlimited in their transmission to the female sex; and so with the\r\nvariations of the male, where the male is more beautiful than the\r\nfemale, I believe the variations were sexually limited in their\r\ntransmission to the males. I am delighted to hear that you have been\r\nhard at work on your MS.--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W.

We are in the middle of the second\r\nvolume, and if the printers will get on, shall be out next month.\r\n\r\nHave you seen in the last number of the _Quarterly Journal of Science_\r\nthe excellent remarks on _Fraser's_ article on Natural Selection failing\r\nas to Man? In one page it gets to the heart of the question, and I have\r\nwritten to the editor to ask who the author is.\r\n\r\nMy friend Spruce's paper on Palms is to be read to-morrow evening at the\r\nLinnean. He tells me it contains a discovery which he calls \"alteration\r\nof function.\" He found a clump of Geonema all of which were females, and\r\nthe next year the same clump were all males! He has found other facts\r\nanalogous to this, and I have no doubt the subject is one that will\r\ninterest you.\r\n\r\nHoping you are pretty well and are getting on steadily with your next\r\nvolumes, and with kind regards to Mrs. Darwin and all your circle,\r\nbelieve me, dear Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

Buckle, of Tiverton Vicarage, Bath, whom I met at Norwich\r\nand found a thoroughly scientific and liberal parson. Perhaps you have\r\nheard that I have undertaken to write an article for the _Quarterly_ (!)\r\non the same subject, to make up for that on \"Modern Geology\" last year\r\nnot mentioning Sir C. Lyell.\r\n\r\nReally, what with the Tories passing Radical Reform Bills and the Church\r\nperiodicals advocating Darwinianism, the millennium must be at\r\nhand.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. January 22, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Your intended dedication pleases me much and I look at\r\nit as a _great_ honour, and this is nothing more than the truth. I am\r\nglad to hear, for Lyell's sake and on general grounds, that you are\r\ngoing to write in the _Quarterly_. Some little time ago I was actually\r\nwishing that you wrote in the _Quarterly_, as I knew that you\r\noccasionally contributed to periodicals, and I thought that your\r\narticles would thus be more widely read.\r\n\r\nThank you for telling me about the _Guardian_, which I will borrow from\r\nLyell. I did note the article in the _Quarterly Journal of Science_ and\r\nput it aside to read again with the articles in _Fraser_ and the\r\n_Spectator_.\r\n\r\nI have been interrupted in my regular work in preparing a new edition[74]\r\nof the \"Origin,\" which has cost me much labour, and which I hope I have\r\nconsiderably improved in two or three important points. I always thought\r\nindividual differences more important than single variations, but now I\r\nhave come to the conclusion that they are of paramount importance, and\r\nin this I believe I agree with you. Fleeming Jenkin's arguments have\r\nconvinced me.[75]\r\n\r\nI heartily congratulate you on your new book being so nearly\r\nfinished.--Believe me, my dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. January 30, 1869._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Will you tell me _where_ are Fleeming Jenkin's arguments\r\non the importance of single variation? Because I at present hold most\r\nstrongly the contrary opinion, that it is the individual differences or\r\n_general variability_ of species that enables them to become modified\r\nand adapted to new conditions.\r\n\r\nVariations or \"sports\" may be important in modifying an animal in one\r\ndirection, as in colour for instance, but how it can possibly work in\r\nchanges requiring co-ordination of many parts, as in Orchids for\r\nexample, I cannot conceive. And as all the more important structural\r\nmodifications of animals and plants imply much co-ordination, it appears\r\nto me that the chances are millions to one against _individual\r\nvariations_ ever coinciding so as to render the required modification\r\npossible. However, let me read first what has convinced you.\r\n\r\nYou may tell Mrs. Darwin that I have now a daughter.\r\n\r\nGive my kind regards to her and all your family.--Very truly yours,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

February 2, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I must have expressed myself atrociously; I meant to\r\nsay exactly the reverse of what you have understood. F. Jenkin argued in\r\nthe _North British Review_[76] against single variations ever being\r\nperpetuated, and has convinced me, though not in quite so broad a manner\r\nas here put. I always thought individual differences more important, but\r\nI was blind and thought that single variations might be preserved much\r\noftener than I now see is possible or probable. I mentioned this in my\r\nformer note merely because I believed that you had come to similar\r\nconclusions, and I like much to be in accord with you. I believe I was\r\nmainly deceived by single variations offering such simple illustrations,\r\nas when man selects.\r\n\r\nWe heartily congratulate you on the birth of your little\r\ndaughter.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC.

Blessings on you and your\r\npublisher for having the pages cut and gilded.\r\n\r\nAs for the dedication, putting quite aside how far I deserve what you\r\nsay, it seems to me decidedly the best expressed dedication which I have\r\never met.\r\n\r\nThe reading will probably last me a month, for I dare not have it read\r\naloud, as I know that it will set me thinking.\r\n\r\nI see that many points will interest me greatly. When I have finished,\r\nif I have anything particular to say, I will write again. Accept my\r\ncordial thanks. The dedication is a thing for my children's children to\r\nbe proud of.--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. March 10, 1869._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Thanks for your kind note. I could not persuade Mr.\r\nMacmillan to cut more than twenty-five copies for my own friends, and he\r\neven seemed to think this a sign of most strange and barbarous taste.\r\n\r\nMr. Weir's paper on the kinds of larvæ, etc., eaten or rejected by\r\ninsectivorous birds was read at the last meeting of the Entomological\r\nSociety and was most interesting and satisfactory. His observations and\r\nexperiments, so far as they have yet gone, confirm in _every instance_\r\nmy hypothetical explanation of the colours of caterpillars. He finds\r\nthat all nocturnal-feeding obscure-coloured caterpillars, all _green_\r\nand _brown_ and _mimicking_ caterpillars, are greedily eaten by almost\r\nevery insectivorous bird. On the other hand, every gaily coloured,\r\nspotted or banded species, which never conceal themselves, and all spiny\r\nand hairy kinds, are _invariably rejected_, either without or after\r\ntrial. He has also come to the curious and rather unexpected conclusion,\r\nthat hairy and spiny caterpillars are not protected by their hairs, but\r\nby their nauseous taste, the hairs being merely an external mark of\r\ntheir uneatableness, like the gay colours of others. He deduces this\r\nfrom two kinds of facts: (1) that very young caterpillars before the\r\nhairs are developed are equally rejected, and (2) that in many cases the\r\nsmooth pupæ and even the perfect insects of the same species are equally\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nHis facts, it is true, are at present not very numerous, but they all\r\npoint one way. They seem to me to lend an immense support to my view of\r\nthe great importance of protection in determining colour, for it has not\r\nonly prevented the eatable species from ever acquiring bright colours,\r\nspots, or markings injurious to them, but it has also conferred on all\r\nthe nauseous species distinguishing marks to render their uneatableness\r\nmore protective to them than it would otherwise be. When you have read\r\nmy book I shall be glad of any hints for corrections if it comes to\r\nanother edition. I was horrified myself by coming accidentally on\r\nseveral verbal inelegancies after all my trouble in correcting, and I\r\nhave no doubt there are many more important errors.--Believe me, dear\r\nDarwin, yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. March 22, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have finished your book.[78] It seems to me\r\nexcellent, and at the same time most pleasant to read. That you ever\r\nreturned alive is wonderful after all your risks from illness and sea\r\nvoyages, especially that most interesting one to Waigiou and back. Of\r\nall the impressions which I have received from your book, the strongest\r\nis that your perseverance in the cause of science was heroic. Your\r\ndescriptions of catching the splendid butterflies have made me quite\r\nenvious, and at the same time have made me feel almost young again, so\r\nvividly have they brought before my mind old days when I collected,\r\nthough I never made such captures as yours. Certainly collecting is the\r\nbest sport in the world. I shall be astonished if your book has not a\r\ngreat success; and your splendid generalisations on geographical\r\ndistribution, with which I am familiar from your papers, will be new to\r\nmost of your readers. I think I enjoyed most the Timor case, as it is\r\nbest demonstrated; but perhaps Celebes is really the most valuable. I\r\nshould prefer looking at the whole Asiatic continent as having formerly\r\nbeen more African in its fauna, than admitting the former existence of a\r\ncontinent across the Indian Ocean. Decaisne's paper on the flora of\r\nTimor, in which he points out its close relation to that of the\r\nMascarene Islands, supports your view. On the other hand, I might\r\nadvance the giraffes, etc., in the Sewalik deposits. How I wish someone\r\nwould collect the plants of Banca! The puzzle of Java, Sumatra and\r\nBorneo is like the three geese and foxes: I have a wish to extend\r\nMalacca through Banca to part of Java and thus make three parallel\r\npeninsulas, but I cannot get the geese and foxes across the river.\r\n\r\nMany parts of your book have interested me much: I always wished to\r\nhear an independent judgment about the Rajah Brooke, and now I have been\r\ndelighted with your splendid eulogium on him.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the fewness and inconspicuousness of the flowers in the\r\ntropics, may it not be accounted for by the hosts of insects, so that\r\nthere is no need for the flowers to be conspicuous? As, according to\r\nHumboldt, fewer plants are social in the tropical than in the temperate\r\nregions, the flowers in the former would not make so great a show.\r\n\r\nIn your note you speak of observing some inelegancies of style. I notice\r\nnone. All is as clear as daylight. I have detected two or three errata.\r\n\r\nIn Vol. I. you write lond_i_acus: is this not an error?\r\n\r\nVol. II., p. 236: for _western_ side of Aru read _eastern_.\r\n\r\nPage 315: Do you not mean the horns of the moose? For the elk has not\r\npalmated horns.\r\n\r\nI have only one criticism of a general nature, and I am not sure that\r\nother geologists would agree with me: you repeatedly speak as if the\r\npouring out of lava, etc., from volcanoes actually caused the subsidence\r\nof an adjoining area. I quite agree that areas undergoing opposite\r\nmovements are somehow connected; but volcanic outbursts must, I think,\r\nbe looked at as mere accidents in the swelling tip of a great dome or\r\nsurface of _plutonic_ rocks; and there seems no more reason to conclude\r\nthat such swelling or elevation in mass is the cause of the subsidence\r\nthan that the subsidence is the cause of the elevation; which latter\r\nview is indeed held by some geologists, I have regretted to find so\r\nlittle about the habits of the many animals which you have seen.\r\n\r\nIn Vol. II., p. 399, I wish I could see the connection between\r\nvariations having been first or long ago selected, and their appearance\r\nat an earlier age in birds of paradise than the variations which have\r\nsubsequently arisen and been selected. In fact, I do not understand your\r\nexplanation of the curious order of development of the ornaments of\r\nthese birds.\r\n\r\nWill you please to tell me whether you are sure that the female\r\nCasuarius (Vol. II., p. 150) sits on her eggs as well as the male?--for,\r\nif I am not mistaken, Bartlett told me that the male alone, who is less\r\nbrightly coloured about the neck, sits on the eggs. In Vol. II., p. 255,\r\nyou speak of male savages ornamenting themselves more than the women, of\r\nwhich I have heard before; now, have you any notion whether they do this\r\nto please themselves, or to excite the admiration of their fellow-men,\r\nor to please the women, or, as is perhaps probable, from all three\r\nmotives?\r\n\r\nFinally, let me congratulate you heartily on having written so excellent\r\na book, full of thought on all sorts of subjects. Once again, let me\r\nthank you for the very great honour which you have done me by your\r\ndedication.--Believe me, my dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nVol. II., p. 455: When in New Zealand I thought the inhabitants a mixed\r\nrace, with the type of Tahiti preponderating over some darker race with\r\nmore frizzled hair; and now that the stone instruments [have] revealed\r\nthe existence of ancient inhabitants, is it not probable that these\r\nislands were inhabited by true Papuans? Judging from descriptions the\r\npure Tahitans must differ much from your Papuans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reference in the following letter is to Wallace's review, in the\r\nApril number of the _Quarterly_, of Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\"\r\n(tenth edition), and of the sixth edition of the \"Elements of Geology.\"\r\nWallace points out that here for the first time Sir C. Lyell gave up his\r\nopposition to Evolution; and this leads Wallace to give a short account\r\nof the views set forth in the \"Origin of Species.\" In this article\r\nWallace makes a definite statement as to his views on the evolution of\r\nman, which were opposed to those of Darwin. He upholds the view that the\r\nbrain of man, as well as the organs of speech, the hand and the external\r\nform, could not have been evolved by Natural Selection (the \"child\" he\r\nis supposed to \"murder \"). At p. 391 he writes: \"In the brain of the\r\nlowest savages and, as far as we know, of the prehistoric races, we have\r\nan organ ... little inferior in size and complexity to that of the\r\nhighest types.... But the mental requirements of the lowest savages,\r\nsuch as the Australians or the Andaman Islanders, are very little above\r\nthose of many animals.... How then was an organ developed far beyond the\r\nneeds of its possessor? Natural Selection could only have endowed the\r\nsavage with a brain a little superior to that of an ape, whereas he\r\nactually possesses one but very little inferior to that of the average\r\nmembers of our learned societies.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage is marked in Darwin's copy with a triply underlined \"No,\"\r\nand with a shower of notes of exclamation. It was probably the first\r\noccasion on which he realised the extent of this great and striking\r\ndivergence in opinion between himself and his colleague. He had,\r\nhowever, some indication of it in Wallace's paper on Man in the\r\n_Anthropological Review_, 1864, referred to in his letter to Wallace of\r\nMay 28, 1864, and again in that of April 14, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. March 27, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I must send a line to thank you, but this note will\r\nrequire no answer. This very morning after writing I found that \"elk\"\r\nwas used for \"moose\" in Sweden, but I had been reading lately about elk\r\nand moose in North America.\r\n\r\nAs you put the case in your letter, which I think differs somewhat from\r\nyour book, I am inclined to agree, and had thought that a feather could\r\nhardly be increased in length until it had first grown to full length,\r\nand therefore it would be increased late in life and transmitted to a\r\ncorresponding age. But the Crossoptilon pheasant, and even the common\r\npheasant, show that the tail feathers can be developed very early.\r\n\r\nThanks for other facts, which I will reflect on when I go again over my\r\nMS.\r\n\r\nI read all that you said about the Dutch Government with much interest,\r\nbut I do not feel I know enough to form any opinion against yours.\r\n\r\nI shall be intensely curious to read the _Quarterly_: I hope you have\r\nnot murdered too completely your own and my child.\r\n\r\nI have lately, i.e. in the new edition of the \"Origin,\"[79] been\r\nmoderating my zeal, and attributing much more to mere useless\r\nvariability. I did think I would send you the sheet, but I daresay you\r\nwould not care to see it, in which I discuss Nägeli's essay on Natural\r\nSelection not affecting characters of no functional importance, and\r\nwhich yet are of high classificatory importance.\r\n\r\nHooker is pretty well satisfied with what I have said on this head. It\r\nwill be curious if we have hit on similar conclusions. You are about the\r\nlast man in England who would deviate a hair's breadth from his\r\nconviction to please any editor in the world.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--After all, I have thought of one question, but if I receive no\r\nanswer I shall understand that (as is probable) you have nothing to say.\r\nI have seen it remarked that the men and women of certain tribes differ\r\na little in shade or tint; but have you ever seen or heard of any\r\ndifference in tint between the two sexes which did not appear to follow\r\nfrom a difference in habits of life?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Bromley, Kent, S.E. April 14, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have been wonderfully interested by your article,[80]\r\nand I should think Lyell will be much gratified by it. I declare if I\r\nhad been editor and had the power of directing you I should have\r\nselected for discussion the very points which you have chosen. I have\r\noften said to younger geologists (for I began in the year 1830) that\r\nthey did not know what a revolution Lyell had effected; nevertheless,\r\nyour extracts from Cuvier have quite astonished me.\r\n\r\nThough not able really to judge, I am inclined to put more confidence in\r\nCroll than you seem to do; but I have been much struck by many of your\r\nremarks on degradation.\r\n\r\nThomson's views of the recent age of the world have been for some time\r\none of my sorest troubles, and so I have been glad to read what you say.\r\nYour exposition of Natural Selection seems to me inimitably good; there\r\nnever lived a better expounder than you.\r\n\r\nI was also much pleased at your discussing the difference between our\r\nviews and Lamarck's. One sometimes sees the odious expression, \"Justice\r\nto myself compels me to say, etc.,\" but you are the only man I ever\r\nheard of who persistently does himself an injustice and never demands\r\njustice. Indeed, you ought in the review to have alluded to your paper\r\nin the Linnean _Journal_, and I feel sure all our friends will agree in\r\nthis, but you cannot \"Burke\" yourself, however much you may try, as may\r\nbe seen in half the articles which appear.\r\n\r\nI was asked but the other day by a German professor for your paper,\r\nwhich I sent him. Altogether, I look at your article as appearing in the\r\n_Quarterly_ as an immense triumph for our cause. I presume that your\r\nremarks on Man are those to which you alluded in your note.\r\n\r\nIf you had not told me I should have thought that they had been added by\r\nsomeone else. As you expected, I differ grievously from you, and I am\r\nvery sorry for it.\r\n\r\nI can see no necessity for calling in an additional and proximate cause\r\nin regard to Man. But the subject is too long for a letter.\r\n\r\nI have been particularly glad to read your discussion, because I am now\r\nwriting and thinking much about Man.\r\n\r\nI hope that your Malay book sells well. I was extremely pleased with the\r\narticle in the _Q.J. of Science_, inasmuch as it is thoroughly\r\nappreciative of your work. Alas! you will probably agree with what the\r\nwriter says about the uses of the bamboo.\r\n\r\nI hear that there is also a good article in the _Saturday Review_, but\r\nhave heard nothing more about it.--Believe me, my dear Wallace, yours\r\never sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have had a baddish fall, my horse partly rolling over me; but I\r\nam getting rapidly well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. April 18, 1869._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I am very glad you think I have done justice to Lyell, and\r\nhave also well \"exposed\" (as a Frenchman would say) Natural Selection.\r\nThere is nothing I like better than writing a little account of it, and\r\ntrying to make it clear to the meanest capacity.\r\n\r\nThe \"Croll\" question is awfully difficult. I had gone into it more\r\nfully, but the Editor made me cut out eight pages.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry indeed to hear of your accident, but trust you will soon\r\nrecover and that it will leave no bad effects.\r\n\r\nI can quite comprehend your feelings with regard to my \"unscientific\"\r\nopinions as to Man, because a few years back I should myself have\r\nlooked at them as equally wild and uncalled for. I shall look with\r\nextreme interest for what you are writing on Man, and shall give full\r\nweight to any explanations you can give of his probable origin. My\r\nopinions on the subject have been modified solely by the consideration\r\nof a series of remarkable phenomena, physical and mental, which I have\r\nnow had every opportunity of fully testing, and which demonstrate the\r\nexistence of forces and influences not yet recognised by science. This\r\nwill, I know, seem to you like some mental hallucination, but as I can\r\nassure you from personal communication with them, that Robert Chambers,\r\nDr. Norris of Birmingham, the well-known physiologist, and C.F. Varley,\r\nthe well-known electrician, who have all investigated the subject for\r\nyears, agree with me both as to the facts and as to the main inferences\r\nto be drawn from them, I am in hopes that you will suspend your judgment\r\nfor a time till we exhibit some corroborative symptoms of insanity.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I can console you by the assurance that I _don't_ agree\r\nwith the _Q.J. of Science_ about bamboo, and that I see no cause to\r\nmodify any of my opinions expressed in my article on the \"Reign of\r\nLaw.\"--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. June 23, 1869._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Thank you very much for the copy of your fifth edition of\r\nthe \"Origin.\" I have not yet read all the additions, but those I have\r\nlooked at seem very interesting, though somewhat brief, but I suppose\r\nyou are afraid of its great and rapid growth.\r\n\r\nA difficult sexual character seems to me the plumules or battledore\r\nscales on the wings of certain families and genera of butterflies,\r\nalmost invariably changing in form with the species and genera in\r\nproportion to other changes, and always constant in each species yet\r\nconfined to the males, and so small and mixed up with the other scales\r\nas to produce no effect on the colour or marking of the wings. How could\r\nsexual selection produce them?\r\n\r\nYour correspondent Mr. Geach is now in England, and if you would like to\r\nsee him I am sure he would be glad to meet you. He is staying with his\r\nbrother (address Guildford), but often comes to town.\r\n\r\nHoping that you have quite recovered from your accident and that the\r\n_great work_ is progressing, believe me, dear Darwin, yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You will perhaps be pleased to hear that German, French, and\r\nDanish translations of my \"Malay Archipelago\" are in progress.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Caerleon, Barmouth, N. Wales. June 25, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--We have been here a fortnight, and shall remain here\r\ntill the beginning of August. I can say nothing good about my health,\r\nand I am so weak that I can hardly crawl half a mile from the house; but\r\nI hope I may improve, and anyhow the magnificent view of Cader is\r\nenjoyable.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I have anything to ask Mr. Geach, nor do I suppose I\r\nshall be in London till late in the autumn, but I should be particularly\r\nobliged, if you have any communication with Mr. Geach, if you would\r\nexpress for me my _sincere_ thanks for his kindness in sending me the\r\nvery valuable answers on Expression. I wrote some months ago to him in\r\nanswer to his last letter.\r\n\r\nI would ask him to Down, but the fatigue to me of receiving a stranger\r\nis something which to you would be utterly unintelligible.\r\n\r\nI think I have heard of the scales on butterflies; but there are lots\r\nof sexual characters which quite baffle all powers of even conjecture.\r\n\r\nYou are quite correct, that I felt forced to make all additions to the\r\n\"Origin\" as short as possible.\r\n\r\nI am indeed pleased to hear, and fully expected, that your Malay work\r\nwould be known throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nOh dear! what would I not give for a little more strength to get on with\r\nmy work.--Ever yours,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI wish that you could have told me that your place in the new Museum was\r\nall settled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. October 20, 1869._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I do not know your son's (Mr. George Darwin's) address at\r\nCambridge. Will you be so good as to forward him the enclosed note\r\nbegging for a little information?\r\n\r\nI was delighted to see the notice in the _Academy_ that you are really\r\ngoing to bring out your book on Man. I anticipate for it an enormous\r\nsale, and shall read it with intense interest, although I expect to find\r\nin it more to differ from than in any of your other books. Some\r\nreasonable and reasoning opponents are now taking the field. I have been\r\nwriting a little notice of Murphy's \"Habit and Intelligence,\" which,\r\nwith much that is strange and unintelligible, contains some very acute\r\ncriticisms and the statement of a few real difficulties. Another article\r\njust sent me from the _Month_ contains some good criticism. How\r\nincipient organs can be useful is a real difficulty, so is the\r\nindependent origin of similar complex organs; but most of his other\r\npoints, though well put, are not very formidable. I am trying to begin a\r\nlittle book on the Distribution of Animals, but I fear I shall not make\r\nmuch of it from my idleness in collecting facts.\r\n\r\nI shall make it a popular sketch first, and, if it succeeds, gather\r\nmaterials for enlarging it at a future time. If any suggestion occurs to\r\nyou as to the kind of maps that would be best, or on any other essential\r\npoint, I should be glad of a hint. I hope your residence in Wales did\r\nyou good. I had no idea you were so near Dolgelly till I met your son\r\nthere one evening when I was going to leave the next morning. It is a\r\nglorious country, but the time I like is May and June--the foliage is so\r\nglorious.\r\n\r\nSincerely hoping you are pretty well, and with kind regards to Mrs.\r\nDarwin and the rest of your family, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent, S.E. October 21, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I forwarded your letter at once to my son George, but\r\nI am nearly sure that he will not be able to tell you anything; I wish\r\nhe could for my own sake; but I suspect there are few men in England who\r\ncould. Pray send me a copy or tell me where your article on Murphy will\r\nbe published. I have just received the _Month_, but have only read half\r\nas yet. I wish I knew who was the author; you ought to know, as he\r\nadmires you so much; he has a wonderful deal of knowledge, but his\r\ndifficulties have not troubled me much as yet, except the case of the\r\ndipterous larva. My book will not be published for a long time, but\r\nMurray wished to insert some notice of it. Sexual selection has been a\r\ntremendous job. Fate has ordained that almost every point on which we\r\ndiffer should be crowded into this vol. Have you seen the October number\r\nof the _Revue des deux Mondes?_ It has an article on you, but I have not\r\nyet read it; and another article, not yet read, by a very good man on\r\nthe Transformist School.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear that you are beginning a book, but do not let it\r\nbe \"little,\" on Distribution, etc. I have no hints to give about maps;\r\nthe subject would require long and anxious consideration. Before Forbes\r\npublished his essay on Distribution and the Glacial Period I wrote out\r\nand had _copied_ an essay on the same subject, which Hooker read. If\r\nthis MS. would be of any use to you, _on account of the references_ in\r\nit to papers, etc., I should be very glad to lend it, to be used in any\r\nway; for I foresee that my strength will never last out to come to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI have been pretty well since my return from Wales, though at the time\r\nit did me no good.\r\n\r\nWe shall be in London next month, when I shall hope to see you.--My dear\r\nWallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W. December 4, [1869]._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Dr. Adolf Bernhard Meyer, who translated my book into\r\nGerman, has written to me for permission to translate my original paper\r\nin the _Linnean Proceedings_ with yours, and wants to put my photograph\r\nand yours in it. If you have given him permission to translate the\r\npapers (which I suppose he can do without permission if he pleases), I\r\nwrite to ask which of your photographs you would wish to represent you\r\nin Germany--the last, or the previous one by Ernest Edwards, which I\r\nthink much the best--as if you like I will undertake to order them and\r\nsave you any more trouble about it. It is, of course, out of the\r\nquestion our meeting to be photographed together, as Mr. Meyer coolly\r\nproposes.\r\n\r\nHoping you are well, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have written a paper on Geological Time, which will appear in\r\n_Nature_, and I _think_ I have hit upon a solution of your greatest\r\ndifficulties in that matter.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent, S.E. December 5, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I wrote to Dr. Meyer that the photographs in England\r\nwould cost much and that they did not seem to me worth the cost to him,\r\nbut that I of course had no sort of objection. I should be greatly\r\nobliged if you would kindly take the trouble to order any one which you\r\nthink best: possibly it would be best to wait, unless you feel sure,\r\ntill you hear again from Dr. M. I sent him a copy of our joint paper. He\r\nhas kindly sent me the translation of your book, which is splendidly got\r\nup, and which I thought I could not better use than by sending it to\r\nFritz Müller in Brazil, who will appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI liked your reviews on Mr. Murphy very much; they are capitally\r\nwritten, like everything which is turned out of your workshop. I was\r\nspecially glad about the eye. If you agree with me, take some\r\nopportunity of bringing forward the case of perfected greyhound or\r\nracehorse, in proof of the possibility of the selection of many\r\ncorrelated variations. I have remarks on this head in my last book.\r\n\r\nIf you throw light on the want of geological time, may honour, eternal\r\nglory and blessings crowd thick on your head.--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that I wrote to Dr. M. to say that I should not soon be\r\nin London, and that, of all things in the world, I hate most the bother\r\nof sitting for photographs, so I declined with many apologies. I have\r\nrecently refused several applications.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, N.W.

The latter part only contains what I think\r\nis new, and I shall be anxious to hear if it at all helps to get over\r\nyour difficulties.\r\n\r\nI have been lately revising and adding to my various papers bearing on\r\nthe \"Origin of Species,\" etc., and am going to print them in a volume\r\nimmediately, under the title of \"Contributions to the Theory of Natural\r\nSelection: A Series of Essays.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last, I put forth my heterodox opinions as to Man, and even\r\nventure to attack the Huxleyan philosophy!\r\n\r\nHoping you are quite well and are getting on with your Man book, believe\r\nme, dear Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--When you have read the proof and done with it, may I beg you to\r\nreturn it to me?--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent, S.E. January 26, [1870]._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have been very much struck by your whole article\r\n(returned by this post), especially as to rate of denudation, for the\r\nstill glaciated surfaces have of late most perplexed me. Also\r\n_especially_ on the lesser mutations of climate during the last 60,000\r\nyears; for I quite think with you no cause so powerful in inducing\r\nspecific changes, through the consequent migrations. Your argument would\r\nbe somewhat strengthened about organic changes having been formerly more\r\nrapid, if Sir W. Thomson is correct that physical changes were formerly\r\nmore violent and abrupt.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject is so new and vast that I suppose you hardly expect\r\nanyone to be at once convinced, but that he should keep your view before\r\nhis mind and let it ferment. This, I think, everyone will be forced to\r\ndo. I have not as yet been able to digest the fundamental notion of the\r\nshortened age of the sun and earth. Your whole paper seems to me\r\nadmirably clear and well put. I may remark that Rütimeyer has shown that\r\nseveral wild mammals in Switzerland since the neolithic period have had\r\ntheir dentition and, I _think_, general size _slightly_ modified. I\r\ncannot believe that the Isthmus of Panama has been open since the\r\ncommencement of the glacial period; for, notwithstanding the fishes, so\r\nfew shells, crustaceans, and, according to Agassiz, not one echinoderm\r\nis common to the sides. I am very glad you are going to publish all your\r\npapers on Natural Selection: I am sure you are right, and that they will\r\ndo our cause much good.\r\n\r\nBut I groan over Man--you write like a metamorphosed (in retrograde\r\ndirection) naturalist, and you the author of the best paper that ever\r\nappeared in the _Anthropological Review_!

Whether I shall have it reduced, or beg Mr. Macmillan for a\r\nstereotype, as you said I might, I have not yet decided.\r\n\r\nI heartily congratulate you on your removal being over, and I much more\r\nheartily condole with myself at your having left London, for I shall\r\nthus miss my talks with you which I always greatly enjoy.\r\n\r\nI was excessively pleased at your review of Galton, and I agree to every\r\nword of it.

There never has been passed on me,\r\nor indeed on anyone, a higher eulogium than yours. I wish that I fully\r\ndeserved it. Your modesty and candour are very far from new to me. I\r\nhope it is a satisfaction to you to reflect--and very few things in my\r\nlife have been more satisfactory to me--that we have never felt any\r\njealousy towards each other, though in one sense rivals. I believe that\r\nI can say this of myself with truth, and I am absolutely sure that it is\r\ntrue of you.\r\n\r\nYou have been a good Christian to give a list of your additions, for I\r\nwant much to read them, and I should hardly have had time just at\r\npresent to have gone through all your articles.\r\n\r\nOf course, I shall immediately read those that are new or greatly\r\naltered, and I will endeavour to be as honest as can reasonably be\r\nexpected.

It is also evident that it is not Mr. Bates's caterpillar,\r\nas that threw the head backwards so as to show the feet above, forming\r\nimitations of keeled scales.\r\n\r\nClaparède has sent me his critique on my book. You will probably have it\r\ntoo. His arguments in reply to my heresy seem to me of the weakest.

To this I replied on November 17, and my reply so\r\npleased Mr. Darwin that he at once wrote to me as follows:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent, S.E. November 22, 1870._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I must ease myself by writing a few words to say how\r\nmuch I and all others in this house admire your article in _Nature_. You\r\nare certainly an unparalleled master in lucidly stating a case and in\r\narguing. Nothing ever was better done than your argument about the term\r\n\"origin of species,\" and the consequences about much being gained, even\r\nif we know nothing about precise cause of each variation. By chance I\r\nhave given a few words in my first volume, now some time printed off,\r\nabout mimetic butterflies, and have touched on two of your points, viz.\r\non species already widely dissimilar not being made to resemble each\r\nother, and about the variations in Lepidoptera being often well\r\npronounced. How strange it is that Mr. Bennett or anyone else should\r\nbring in the action of the mind as a leading cause of variation, seeing\r\nthe beautiful and complex adaptations and modifications of structure in\r\nplants, which I do not suppose they would say had minds.\r\n\r\nI have finished the first volume, and am half-way through the first\r\nproof of the second volume, of my confounded book, which half kills me\r\nby fatigue, and which I much fear will quite kill me in your good\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\nIf you have leisure I should much like a little news of you and your\r\ndoings and your family.--Ever yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH.

We still agree, I\r\nam sure, on nineteen points out of twenty, and on the twentieth I am not\r\ninconvincible. But then I must be convinced by facts and arguments, not\r\nby high-handed ridicule such as Claparède's.\r\n\r\nI hope you see the difference between such criticisms as his, and that\r\nin the last number of the _North American Review_, where my last chapter\r\nis really criticised, point by point; and though I think some of it very\r\nweak, I admit that some is very strong, and almost converts me from the\r\nerror of my ways.\r\n\r\nAs to your new book, I am sure it will not make me think less highly of\r\nyou than I do, unless you do, what you have never done yet, ignore\r\nfacts and arguments that go against you.\r\n\r\nI am doing nothing just now but writing articles and putting down\r\nanti-Darwinians, being dreadfully ridden upon by a horrid\r\nold-man-of-the-sea, who has agreed to let me have the piece of land I\r\nhave set my heart on, and which I have been trying to get of him since\r\nlast February, but who will not answer letters, will not sign an\r\nagreement, and keeps me week after week in anxiety, though I have\r\naccepted his own terms unconditionally, one of which is that I pay rent\r\nfrom last Michaelmas! And now the finest weather for planting is going\r\nby. It is a bit of a wilderness that can be made into a splendid\r\nimitation of a Welsh valley in little, and will enable me to gather\r\nround me all the beauties of the temperate flora which I so much admire,\r\nor I would not put up with the little fellow's ways. The fixing on a\r\nresidence for the rest of your life is an important event, and I am not\r\nlikely to be in a very settled frame of mind for some time.\r\n\r\nI am answering A.

January 27, 1871._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for your first volume,[82] which I have just\r\nfinished reading through with the greatest pleasure and interest, and I\r\nhave also to thank you for the great tenderness with which you have\r\ntreated me and my heresies.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of sexual selection and protection you do not yet\r\nconvince me that I am wrong, but I expect your heaviest artillery will\r\nbe brought up in your second volume, and I may have to capitulate. You\r\nseem, however, to have somewhat misunderstood my exact meaning, and I do\r\nnot think the difference between us is quite so great as you seem to\r\nthink it. There are a number of passages in which you argue against the\r\nview that the female has, in any large number of cases, been \"specially\r\nmodified\" for protection, or that _colour_ has _generally_ been obtained\r\nby either sex for purposes of protection.\r\n\r\nBut my view is, and I thought I had made it clear, that the female has\r\n(in most cases) been simply prevented from acquiring the gay tints of\r\nthe male (even when there was a tendency for her to inherit it) because\r\nit was hurtful; and, that when protection is not needed, gay colours are\r\nso generally acquired by both sexes as to show that inheritance by both\r\nsexes of colour variations is the most usual, when _not prevented from\r\nacting_ by Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nThe colour itself may be acquired either by sexual selection or by other\r\nunknown causes. There are, however, difficulties in the very wide\r\napplication you give to sexual selection which at present stagger me,\r\nthough no one was or is more ready than myself to admit the perfect\r\ntruth of the principle or the immense importance and great variety of\r\nits applications. Your chapters on Man are of intense interest, but as\r\ntouching my special heresy not as yet altogether convincing, though of\r\ncourse I fully agree with every word and every argument which goes to\r\nprove the \"evolution\" or \"development\" of man out of a lower form. My\r\nonly difficulties are as to whether you have accounted for _every_ step\r\nof the development by ascertained laws. Feeling sure that the book will\r\nkeep up and increase your high reputation and be immensely successful,\r\nas it deserves to be, believe me, dear Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent, S.E. January 30, 1871._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Your note has given me very great pleasure, chiefly\r\nbecause I was so anxious not to treat you with the least disrespect, and\r\nit is so difficult to speak fairly when differing from anyone. If I had\r\noffended you, it would have grieved me more than you will readily\r\nbelieve. Secondly, I am greatly pleased to hear that Vol. I. interests\r\nyou; I have got so sick of the whole subject that I felt in utter doubt\r\nabout the value of any part. I intended when speaking of the female not\r\nhaving been specially modified for protection to include the prevention\r\nof characters acquired by the [male symbol] being transmitted to the\r\n[female symbol]; but I now see it would have been better to have said\r\n\"specially acted on,\" or some such term. Possibly my intention may be\r\nclearer in Vol. II. Let me say that my conclusions are chiefly founded\r\non a consideration of all animals taken in a body, bearing in mind how\r\ncommon the rules of sexual differences appear to be in all classes. The\r\nfirst copy of the chapter on Lepidoptera agreed pretty closely with you.\r\nI then worked on, came back to Lepidoptera, and thought myself compelled\r\nto alter it, finished sexual selection, and for the last time went over\r\nLepidoptera, and again I felt forced to alter it.\r\n\r\nI hope to God there will be nothing disagreeable to you in Vol. II., and\r\nthat I have spoken fairly of your views. I feel the more fearful on this\r\nhead, because I have just read (but not with sufficient care) Mivart's\r\nbook,[83] and I feel _absolutely certain_ that he meant to be fair (but\r\nhe was stimulated by theological fervour); yet I do not think he has\r\nbeen quite fair: he gives in one place only half of one of my sentences,\r\nignores in many places all that I have said on effects of use, speaks of\r\nmy dogmatic assertion, \"of false belief,\" whereas the end of paragraph\r\nseems to me to render the sentence by no means dogmatic or arrogant;\r\netc. etc. I have since its publication received some quite charming\r\nletters from him.\r\n\r\nWhat an ardent (and most justly) admirer he is of you. His work, I do\r\nnot doubt, will have a most potent influence versus Natural Selection.\r\nThe pendulum will now swing against us. The part which, I think, will\r\nhave most influence is when he gives whole series of cases, like that of\r\nwhalebone, in which we cannot explain the gradational steps; but such\r\ncases have no weight on my mind--if a few fish were extinct, who on\r\nearth would have ventured even to conjecture that lung had originated in\r\nswim-bladder? In such a case as Thylacines, I think he was bound to say\r\nthat the resemblance of the jaw to that of the dog is superficial; the\r\nnumber and correspondence and development of teeth being widely\r\ndifferent. I think, again, when speaking of the necessity of altering a\r\nnumber of characters together, he ought to have thought of man having\r\npower by selection to modify simultaneously or almost simultaneously\r\nmany points, as in making a greyhound or racehorse--as enlarged upon in\r\nmy \"Domestic Animals.\"\r\n\r\nMivart is savage or contemptuous about my \"moral sense,\" and so probably\r\nwill you be. I am extremely pleased that he agrees with my position, _as\r\nfar as animal nature is concerned_, of man in the series; or, if\r\nanything, thinks I have erred in making him too distinct.\r\n\r\nForgive me for scribbling at such length.\r\n\r\nYou have put me quite in good spirits, I did so dread having been\r\nunintentionally unfair towards your views. I hope earnestly the second\r\nvolume will escape as well. I care now very little what others say. As\r\nfor our not quite agreeing, really in such complex subjects it is almost\r\nimpossible for two men who arrive independently at their conclusions to\r\nagree fully--it would be unnatural for them to do so.--Yours ever very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Holly House, Barking, E. March 11, 1871._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I need not say that I read your second volume with, if\r\npossible, a greater interest than the first, as so many topics of\r\nspecial interest to me are treated of. You will not be surprised to find\r\nthat you have not convinced me on the \"female protection\" question, but\r\nyou _will_ be surprised to hear that I do not despair of convincing you.\r\nI have been writing, as you are aware, a review for the _Academy_, which\r\nI tried to refuse doing, but the Editor used as an argument the\r\nstatement that you wished me to do so. It is not an easy job fairly to\r\nsummarise such a book, but I hope I have succeeded tolerably. When I got\r\nto discussion, I felt more at home, but I most sincerely trust that I\r\nmay not have let pass any word that may seem to you in the least too\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nYou have not written a word about me that I could wish altered, but as I\r\nknow you wish me to be candid with you, I will mention that you have\r\nquoted one passage in a note (p. 376, Vol. II.) which seems to me a\r\ncaricature of anything I have written.\r\n\r\nNow let me ask you to rejoice with me, for I have got my chalk pit, and\r\nam hard at work engineering a road up its precipitous slopes. I hope you\r\nmay be able to come and see me there some day, as it is an easy ride\r\nfrom London, and I shall be anxious to know if it is equal to the pit in\r\nthe wilds of Kent Mrs. Darwin mentioned when I lunched with you. Should\r\nyour gardener in the autumn have any thinnings out of almost any kind\r\nof hardy plants they would be welcome, as I have near four acres of\r\nground in which I want to substitute ornamental plants for weeds.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes, and hoping you may have health and strength to go on\r\nwith your great work, believe me, dear Darwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nMy review will appear next Wednesday.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent, S.E. March 16, 1871._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have just read your grand review.[84] It is in every\r\nway as kindly expressed towards myself as it is excellent in matter. The\r\nLyells have been here, and Sir C. remarked that no one wrote such good\r\nscientific reviews as you, and, as Miss Buckley added, you delight in\r\npicking out all that is good, though very far from blind to the bad. In\r\nall this I most entirely agree. I shall always consider your review as a\r\ngreat honour, and however much my book may hereafter be abused, as no\r\ndoubt it will be, your review will console me, notwithstanding that we\r\ndiffer so greatly.\r\n\r\nI will keep your objections to my views in my mind, but I fear that the\r\nlatter are almost stereotyped in my mind, I thought for long weeks about\r\nthe inheritance and selection difficulty, and covered quires of paper\r\nwith notes, in trying to get out of it, but could not, though clearly\r\nseeing that it would be a great relief if I could. I will confine myself\r\nto two or three remarks. I have been much impressed with what you urge\r\nagainst colour[85] in the case of insects having been acquired through\r\nsexual selection. I always saw that the evidence was very weak; but I\r\nstill think, if it be admitted that the musical instruments of insects\r\nhave been gained through sexual selection, that there is not the least\r\nimprobability in colour having been thus gained. Your argument with\r\nrespect to the denudation of mankind, and also to insects, that taste on\r\nthe part of one sex would have to remain nearly the same during many\r\ngenerations, in order that sexual selection should produce any effect, I\r\nagree to, and I think this argument would be sound if used by one who\r\ndenied that, for instance, the plumes of birds of paradise had been so\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nI believe that you admit this, and if so I do not see how your argument\r\napplies in other cases. I have recognised for some short time that I\r\nhave made a great omission in not having discussed, as far as I could,\r\nthe acquisition of taste, its inherited nature, and its permanence\r\nwithin pretty close limits for long periods.\r\n\r\nOne other point and I have done: I see by p. 179 of your review that I\r\nmust have expressed myself very badly to have led you to think that I\r\nconsider the prehensile organs of males as affording evidence of the\r\nfemales exerting a choice. I have never thought so, and if you chance to\r\nremember the passage (but do not hunt for it), pray point it out to me.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry that I gave the note from Mr. Stebbing; I thought\r\nmyself bound to notice his suggestion of beauty as a cause of\r\ndenudation, and thus I was led on to give his argument. I altered the\r\nfinal passage which seemed to me offensive, and I had misgivings about\r\nthe first part.\r\n\r\nI heartily wish I had yielded to these misgivings. I will omit in any\r\nfuture edition the latter half of the note.\r\n\r\nI have heard from Miss Buckley that you have got possession of your\r\nchalk pit, and I congratulate you on the tedious delay being over. I\r\nfear all our bushes are so large that there is nothing which we are at\r\nall likely to grub up.\r\n\r\nYears ago we threw away loads of things. I should very much like to see\r\nyour house and grounds; but I fear the journey would be too long. Going\r\neven to Kew knocks me up, and I have almost ceased trying to do so.\r\n\r\nOnce again let me thank you warmly for your admirable review.--My dear\r\nWallace, yours ever very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nWhat an excellent address you gave about Madeira, but I wish you had\r\nalluded to Lyell's discussion on land shells, etc.--not that he has said\r\na word on the subject. The whole address quite delighted me. I hear Mr.\r\nCrotch[86] disputed some of your facts about the wingless insects, but he\r\nis a _crotchety_ man. As far as I remember, I did not venture to ask Mr.\r\nAppleton to get you to review me, but only said, in answer to an\r\ninquiry, that you would undoubtedly be the best, or one of the very few\r\nmen who could do so effectively.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent, S.E.

It is grand as\r\nshowing that our subject flourishes, your book coming to a new edition\r\nso soon. My book also sells immensely; the edition will, I believe, be\r\n6,500 copies. I am tired with writing, for the load of letters which I\r\nreceive is enough to make a man cry, yet some few are curious and\r\nvaluable. I got one to-day from a doctor on the hair on backs of young\r\nweakly children, which afterwards falls off. Also on hairy idiots. But I\r\nam tired to death, so farewell.\r\n\r\nThanks for your last letter.\r\n\r\nThere is a very striking second article on my book in the _Pall Mall_.\r\nThe articles in the _Spectator_[87] have also interested me much.--Again\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nC.

If not, get it. It solves the great problem of the almost\r\nunlimited duration of the sun's heat in what appears to me a most\r\nsatisfactory manner. I recommended it to Sir C. Lyell, and he tells me\r\nthat Grove spoke very highly of it to him. It has been somewhat ignored\r\nby the critics because it is by a new man with a perfectly original\r\nhypothesis, founded on a vast accumulation of physical and chemical\r\nfacts; but not being encumbered with any mathematical shibboleths, they\r\nhave evidently been afraid that anything so intelligible could not be\r\nsound. The manner in which everything in physical astronomy is explained\r\nis almost as marvellous as the powers of Natural Selection in the same\r\nway, and naturally excites a suspicion that the respective authors are\r\npushing their theories \"a little too far.\"\r\n\r\nIf you read it, get Proctor's book on the Sun at the same time, and\r\nrefer to his coloured plates of the protuberances, corona, etc., which\r\nmarvellously correspond with what Matthieu Williams's theory requires.\r\nThe author is a practical chemist engaged in iron manufacture, and it is\r\nfrom furnace chemistry that he has been led to the subject. I think it\r\nthe most original, most thoughtful and most carefully-worked-out theory\r\nthat has appeared for a long time, and it does not say much for the\r\ncritics that, as far as I know, its great merits have not been properly\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nI have been so fully occupied with road-making, well-digging, garden-\r\nand house-planning, planting, etc., that I have given up all other work.\r\n\r\nDo you not admire our friend Miss Buckley's admirable article in\r\n_Macmillan_? It seems to me the best and most original that has been\r\nwritten on your book.\r\n\r\nHoping you are well, and are not working too hard, I remain yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. July 9, 1871._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I send by this post a review by Chauncey Wright, as I\r\nmuch want your opinion of it, as soon as you can send it. I consider you\r\nan incomparably better critic than I am. The article, though not very\r\nclearly written, and poor in parts for want of knowledge, seems to me\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\nMivart's book is producing a great effect against Natural Selection, and\r\nmore especially against me. Therefore, if you think the article even\r\nsomewhat good, I will write and get permission to publish it as a\r\nshilling pamphlet, together with the MS. addition (enclosed), for which\r\nthere was not room at the end of the review. I do not suppose I should\r\nlose more than £20 or £30.\r\n\r\nI am now at work at a new and cheap edition of the \"Origin,\" and shall\r\nanswer several points in Mivart's book and introduce a new chapter for\r\nthis purpose; but I treat the subject so much more concretely, and I\r\ndaresay less philosophically, than Wright, that we shall not interfere\r\nwith each other. You will think me a bigot when I say, after studying\r\nMivart, I was never before in my life so convinced of the _general_\r\n(i.e. not in detail) truth of the views in the \"Origin.\" I grieve to see\r\nthe omission of the words by Mivart, detected by Wright.[88] I complained\r\nto M. that in two cases he quotes only the commencement of sentences by\r\nme and thus modifies my meaning; but I never supposed he would have\r\nomitted words. There are other cases of what I consider unfair\r\ntreatment. I conclude with sorrow that though he means to be honourable,\r\nhe is so bigoted that he cannot act fairly.\r\n\r\nI was glad to see your letter in _Nature_, though I think you were a\r\nlittle hard on the silly and presumptuous man.\r\n\r\nI hope that your house and grounds are progressing well, and that you\r\nare in all ways flourishing.\r\n\r\nI have been rather seedy, but a few days in London did me much good; and\r\nmy dear good wife is going to take me somewhere, _nolens volens_, at the\r\nend of this month.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Holly Home, Barking, E. July 12, 1871._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for giving me the opportunity to read at my\r\nleisure the very talented article of Mr. C. Wright. His criticism of\r\nMivart, though very severe, is, I think, in most cases sound; but I find\r\nthe larger part of the article so heavy and much of the language and\r\nargument so very obscure, that I very much doubt the utility of printing\r\nit separately. I do not think the readers of Mivart could ever read it\r\nin that form, and I am sure your own answer to Mivart's arguments will\r\nbe so much more clear and to the point, that the other will be\r\nunnecessary. You might extract certain portions in your own chapter,\r\nsuch as the very ingenious suggestion as to the possible origin of\r\nmammary glands, as well as the possible use of the rattle of the\r\nrattlesnake, etc.\r\n\r\nI cannot see the force of Mivart's objection to the theory of production\r\nof the long neck of the giraffe (suggested in my first Essay), and which\r\nC. Wright seems to admit, while his \"watch-tower\" theory seems to me\r\nmore difficult and unlikely as a means of origin. The argument, \"Why\r\nhaven't other allied animals been modified in the same way?\" seems to me\r\nthe weakest of the weak. I must say also I do not see any great reason\r\nto complain of the \"words\" left out by Mivart, as they do not seem to me\r\nmaterially to affect the meaning. Your expression, \"and tends to depart\r\nin a slight degree,\" I think hardly grammatical; a _tendency_ to depart\r\ncannot very well be said to be in a slight degree; a _departure_ can,\r\nbut a tendency must be either a _slight tendency_ or a _strong\r\ntendency_; the degree to which the departure may reach must depend on\r\nfavourable or unfavourable causes in addition to the tendency itself.\r\nMivart's words, \"and tending to depart from the parental type,\" seem to\r\nme quite unobjectionable as a paraphrase of yours, because the \"tending\"\r\nis kept in; and your own view undoubtedly is that the tendency may lead\r\nto an ultimate departure to any extent. Mivart's error is to suppose\r\nthat your words favour the view of _sudden departures_, and I do not see\r\nthat the expression he uses really favours his view a bit more than if\r\nhe had quoted your exact words. The expression of yours he relies upon\r\nis evidently \"the whole organism seeming to have become plastic,\" and he\r\nargues, no doubt erroneously, that having so become \"plastic,\" any\r\namount or a larger amount of sudden variation in some direction is\r\nlikely.\r\n\r\nMivart's greatest error, the confounding \"individual variations\" with\r\n\"minute or imperceptible variations,\" is well exposed by C. Wright, and\r\nthat part I should like to see reprinted; but I always thought you laid\r\ntoo much stress on the slowness of the action of Natural Selection owing\r\nto the smallness and rarity of favourable variations. In your chapter on\r\nNatural Selection the expressions, \"extremely slight modifications,\"\r\n\"every variation even the slightest,\" \"every grade of constitutional\r\ndifference,\" occur, and these have led to errors such as Mivart's, I say\r\nall this because I feel sure that Mivart would be the last to\r\nintentionally misrepresent you, and he has told me that he was sorry the\r\nword \"infinitesimal,\" as applied to variations used by Natural\r\nSelection, got into his book, and that he would alter it, as no doubt he\r\nhas done, in his second edition.\r\n\r\nSome of Mivart's strongest points--the eye and ear, for instance--are\r\nunnoticed in the review. You will, of course, reply to these. His\r\nstatement of the \"missing link\" argument is also forcible, and has, I\r\nhave no doubt, much weight with the public. As to all his minor\r\narguments, I feel with you that they leave Natural Selection stronger\r\nthan ever, while the two or three main arguments do leave a lingering\r\ndoubt in my mind of some fundamental organic law of development of which\r\nwe have as yet no notion.\r\n\r\nPray do not attach any weight to my opinions as to the review. It is\r\nvery clever, but the writer seems a little like those critics who know\r\nan author's or an artist's meaning better than they do themselves.\r\n\r\nMy house is now in the hands of a contractor, but I am wall-building,\r\netc., and very busy.--With best wishes, believe me, dear Darwin, yours\r\nvery faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. July 12, 1871._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Very many thanks. As soon as I read your letter I\r\ndetermined, not to print the paper, notwithstanding my eldest daughter,\r\nwho is a very good critic, thought it so interesting as to be worth\r\nreprinting. Then my wife came in, and said, \"I do not much care about\r\nthese things and shall therefore be a good judge whether it is very\r\ndull.\" So I will leave my decision open for a day or two. Your letter\r\nhas been, and will be, of use to me in other ways: thus I had quite\r\nforgotten that you had taken up the case of the giraffe in your first\r\nmemoir, and I must look to this. I feel very doubtful how far I shall\r\nsucceed in answering Mivart; it is so difficult to answer objections to\r\ndoubtful points and make the discussion readable. I shall make only a\r\nselection. The worst of it is that I cannot possibly hunt through all my\r\nreferences for isolated points; it would take me three weeks of\r\nintolerably hard work. I wish I had your power of arguing clearly. At\r\npresent I feel sick of everything, and if I could occupy my time and\r\nforget my daily discomforts or little miseries, I would never publish\r\nanother word. But I shall cheer up, I daresay, soon, being only just got\r\nover a bad attack. Farewell. God knows why I bother you about myself.\r\n\r\nI can say nothing more about missing links than what I have said. I\r\nshould rely much on pre-Silurian times; but then comes Sir W. Thomson\r\nlike an odious spectre. Farewell.--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI was grieved to see in the _Daily News_ that the madman about the flat\r\nearth has been threatening your life. What an odious trouble this must\r\nhave been to you.\r\n\r\nP.S.--There is a most cutting review of me in the _Quarterly_:[89] I have\r\nonly read a few pages. The skill and style make me think of Mivart. I\r\nshall soon be viewed as the most despicable of men. This _Quarterly_\r\nreview tempts me to republish Ch. Wright, even if not read by anyone,\r\njust to show that someone will say a word against Mivart, and that his\r\n(i.e. Mivart's) remarks ought not to be swallowed without some\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nI quite agree with what you say that Mivart fully intends to be\r\nhonourable; but he seems to me to have the mind of a most able lawyer\r\nretained to plead against us, and especially against me. God knows\r\nwhether my strength and spirit will last out to write a chapter versus\r\nMivart and others; I do so hate controversy, and feel I should do it so\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have now finished the review: there can be no doubt it is by\r\nMivart, and wonderfully clever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Holly House, Barking, E. July 16, 1871._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I am very sorry you are so unwell, and that you allow\r\ncriticisms to worry you so. Remember the noble army of converts you have\r\nmade! and the host of the most talented men living who support you\r\nwholly. What do you think of putting C. Wright's article as an appendix\r\nto the new edition of the \"Origin\"? That would get it read, and obviate\r\nmy chief objection, that the people who read Mivart and the \"Origin\"\r\nwill very few of them buy a separate pamphlet to read. Pamphlets are\r\nsuch nuisances. I don't think Mivart could have written the _Quarterly_\r\narticle, but I will look at it and shall, I think, be able to tell. Pray\r\nkeep your spirits up. I am so distracted by building troubles that I can\r\nwrite nothing, and I shall not, till I get settled in my new house,\r\nsome time next spring, I hope.--With best wishes, believe me yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

August 1, 1871._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Your kind and sympathetic letter pleased me greatly\r\nand did me good, but as you are so busy I did not answer it. I write now\r\nbecause I have just received a very remarkable letter from Fritz Müller\r\n(with butterflies' wings gummed on paper as illustrations) on mimicry,\r\netc. I think it is well worth your reading, but I will not send it,\r\nunless I receive a 1/2d. card to this effect. He puts the difficulty of\r\nfirst start in imitation excellently, and gives wonderful proof of\r\ncloseness of the imitation. He hints a curious addition to the theory in\r\nrelation to sexual selection, which you will think madly hypothetical:\r\nit occurred to me in a very different class of cases, but I was afraid\r\nto publish it. It would aid the theory of imitative protection, _when\r\nthe colours are bright_. He seems much pleased with your caterpillar\r\ntheory. I wish the letter could be published, but without coloured\r\nillustrations [it] would, I fear, be unintelligible.\r\n\r\nI have not yet made up my mind about Wright's review; I shall stop till\r\nI hear from him. Your suggestion would make the \"Origin,\" already too\r\nlarge, still more bulky.\r\n\r\nBy the way, did Mr. Youmans, of the United States, apply to you to write\r\na popular sketch of Natural Selection? I told him you would do it\r\nimmeasurably better than anyone in the world. My head keeps very rocky\r\nand wretched, but I am better,--Ever yours most truly,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Holly House, Barking, E. March 3, 1872._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for your new edition of the \"Origin,\" which I\r\nhave been too busy to acknowledge before. I think your answer to Mivart\r\non the initial stages of modification ample and complete, and the\r\ncomparison of whale and duck most beautiful. I always saw the fallacy of\r\nthese objections, of course. The eye and ear objection you have not so\r\nsatisfactorily answered, and to me the difficulty exists of how _three\r\ntimes over_ an organ of sight was developed with the apparatus even\r\napproximately identical. Why should not, in one case out of the three,\r\nthe heat rays or the chemical rays have been utilised for the same\r\npurpose, in which case no translucent media would have been required,\r\nand yet vision might have been just as perfect? The fact that the eyes\r\nof insects and molluscs are transparent to us shows that the very same\r\nlimited portion of the rays of the spectrum is utilised for vision by\r\nthem as by us.\r\n\r\nThe chances seem to me immense against that having occurred through\r\n\"fortuitous variation,\" as Mivart puts it.\r\n\r\nI see still further difficulties on this point but cannot go into them\r\nnow. Many thanks for your kind invitation. I will try and call some day,\r\nbut I am now very busy trying to make my house habitable by Lady Day,\r\nwhen I _must_ be in it.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

July 27, 1872._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have just read with infinite satisfaction your\r\ncrushing article in _Nature_.[90] I have been the more glad to see it, as\r\nI have not seen the book itself: I did not order it, as I felt sure\r\nfrom Dr. B.'s former book that he could write nothing of value. But\r\nassuredly I did not suppose that anyone would have written such a mass\r\nof inaccuracies and rubbish. How rich is everything which he says and\r\nquotes from Herbert Spencer!\r\n\r\nBy the way, I suppose that you read H. Spencer's answer to Martineau: it\r\nstruck me as quite wonderfully good, and I felt even more strongly\r\ninclined than before to bow in reverence before him. Nothing has amused\r\nme more in your review than Dr. B.'s extraordinary presumption in\r\ndeciding that such men as Lyell, Owen, H. Spencer, Mivart, Gaudry, etc.\r\netc., are all wrong. I daresay it would be very delightful to feel such\r\noverwhelming confidence in oneself.\r\n\r\nI have had a poor time of it of late, rarely having an hour of comfort,\r\nexcept when asleep or immersed in work; and then when that is over I\r\nfeel dead with fatigue. I am now correcting my little book on\r\nExpression; but it will not be published till November, when of course a\r\ncopy will be sent to you. I shall now try whether I can occupy myself\r\nwithout writing anything more on so difficult a subject as Evolution.\r\n\r\nI hope you are now comfortably settled in your new house, and have more\r\nleisure than you have had for some time. I have looked out in the papers\r\nfor any notice about the curatorship of the new Museum, but have seen\r\nnothing. If anything is decided in your favour, I _beg_ you to inform\r\nme.--My dear Wallace, very truly yours,\r\n\r\nC.

In this case please post it. If you do not\r\n_at all_ wish it, I should rather prefer not sending it, and in this\r\ncase please tear it up. And I beg you to do the same, if you intend\r\nanswering Dr. Bree yourself, as you will do it incomparably better than\r\nI should. Also please tear it up if you don't like the letter.--My dear\r\nWallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. August 4, 1872._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I have sent your letter to _Nature_, as I think it will\r\nsettle that question far better than anything I can say. Many thanks for\r\nit. I have not seen Dr. Bree's letter yet, as I get _Nature_ here very\r\nirregularly, but as I was very careful to mention none but _real errors_\r\nin Dr. Bree's book, I do not imagine there will be any necessity for my\r\ntaking any notice of it. It was really entertaining to have such a book\r\nto review, the errors and misconceptions were so inexplicable and the\r\nself-sufficiency of the man so amazing. Yet there is some excellent\r\nwriting in the book, and to a half-informed person it has all the\r\nappearance of being a most valuable and authoritative work.\r\n\r\nI am now reviewing a much more important book and one that, if I mistake\r\nnot, will really compel you sooner or later to modify some of your\r\nviews, though it will not at all affect the main doctrine of Natural\r\nSelection as applied to the higher animals. I allude, of course, to\r\nBastian's \"Beginnings of Life,\" which you have no doubt got. It is hard\r\nreading, but intensely interesting. I am a thorough convert to his main\r\nresults, and it seems to me that nothing more important has appeared\r\nsince your \"Origin.\" It is a pity he is so awfully voluminous and\r\ndiscursive. When you have thoroughly digested it I shall be glad to know\r\nwhat you are disposed to think. My first notice of it will I think\r\nappear in _Nature_ next week, but I have been hurried for it, and it is\r\nnot so well written an article as I could wish.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope your health is improving.--Believe me yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I fear Lubbock's motion is being pushed off to the end of the\r\nSession, and Hooker's case will not be fairly considered. I hope the\r\nmatter will _not_ be allowed to drop.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. August 28, 1872._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have at last finished the gigantic job of reading\r\nDr. Bastian's book, and have been deeply interested in it. You wished to\r\nhear my impression, but it is not worth sending.\r\n\r\nHe seems to me an extremely able man, as indeed I thought when I read\r\nhis first essay. His general argument in favour of archebiosis[92] is\r\nwonderfully strong; though I cannot think much of some few of his\r\narguments. The result is that I am bewildered and astonished by his\r\nstatements, but am not convinced; though on the whole it seems to me\r\nprobable that archebiosis is true. I am not convinced partly I think\r\nowing to the deductive cast of much of his reasoning; and I know not\r\nwhy, but I never feel convinced by deduction, even in the case of H.\r\nSpencer's writings. If Dr. B.'s book had been turned upside down, and he\r\nhad begun with the various cases of heterogenesis, and then gone on to\r\norganic and afterwards to saline solutions, and had then given his\r\ngeneral arguments, I should have been, I believe, much more influenced.\r\nI suspect, however, that my chief difficulty is the effect of old\r\nconvictions being stereotyped on my brain. I must have more evidence\r\nthat germs or the minutest fragments of the lowest forms are always\r\nkilled by 212° of Fahr. Perhaps the mere reiteration of the statements\r\ngiven by Dr. B. by other men whose judgment I respect and who have\r\nworked long on the lower organisms would suffice to convince me. Here is\r\na fine confession of intellectual weakness; but what an inexplicable\r\nframe of mind is that of belief.\r\n\r\nAs for Rotifers and Tardigrades being spontaneously generated, my mind\r\ncan no more digest such statements, whether true or false, than my\r\nstomach can digest a lump of lead.\r\n\r\nDr. B. is always comparing archebiosis as well as growth to\r\ncrystallisation; but on this view a Rotifer or Tardigrade is adapted to\r\nits humble conditions of life by a happy accident; and this I cannot\r\nbelieve. That observations of the above nature may easily be altogether\r\nwrong is well shown by Dr. B. having declared to Huxley that he had\r\nwatched the entire development of a leaf of Sphagnum. He must have\r\nworked with very impure materials in some cases, as plenty of organisms\r\nappeared in a saline solution not containing an atom of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nI wholly disagree with Dr. B. about many points in his latter chapters.\r\nThus the frequency of generalised forms in the older strata seems to me\r\nclearly to indicate the common descent with divergence of more recent\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all his sneers, I do not strike my colours as yet about\r\npangenesis. I should like to live to see archebiosis proved true, for it\r\nwould be a discovery of transcendent importance; or if false I should\r\nlike to see it disproved, and the facts otherwise explained; but I shall\r\nnot live to see all this. If ever proved, Dr. B. will have taken a\r\nprominent part in the work. How grand is the onward rush of science; it\r\nis enough to console us for the many errors which we have committed and\r\nfor our efforts being overlaid and forgotten in the mass of new facts\r\nand new views which are daily turning up.\r\n\r\nThis is all I have to say about Dr. B.'s book, and it certainly has not\r\nbeen worth saying. Nevertheless, reward me whenever you can by giving me\r\nany news about your appointment to the Bethnal Green Museum.--My dear\r\nWallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. August 31, 1872._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for your long and interesting letter about\r\nBastian's book, though I almost regret that my asking you for your\r\nopinion should have led you to give yourself so much trouble. I quite\r\nunderstand your frame of mind, and think it quite a natural and proper\r\none. You had hard work to hammer your views into people's heads at\r\nfirst, and if Bastian's theory is true he will have still harder work,\r\nbecause the facts he appeals to are themselves so difficult to\r\nestablish. Are not you mistaken about the Sphagnum? As I remember it,\r\nHuxley detected a fragment of Sphagnum leaf _in the same solution in\r\nwhich a fungoid growth had been developed_. Bastian mistook the Sphagnum\r\nalso for a vegetable growth, and on account of this ignorance of the\r\ncharacter of Sphagnum, and its presence in the solution, Huxley rejected\r\nsomewhat contemptuously (and I think very illogically) all Bastian's\r\nobservations. Again, as to the saline solution without nitrogen, would\r\nnot the air supply what was required?\r\n\r\nI quite agree that the book would have gained force by rearrangement in\r\nthe way you suggest, but perhaps he thought it necessary to begin with a\r\ngeneral argument in order to induce people to examine his new collection\r\nof facts, I am impressed _most_ by the agreement of so many observers,\r\nsome of whom struggle to explain away their own facts. What a\r\nwonderfully ingenious and suggestive paper that is by Galton on \"Blood\r\nRelationship.\" It helps to render intelligible many of the\r\neccentricities of heredity, atavism, etc.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell was good enough to write to Lord Ripon and Mr. Cole[93]\r\nabout me and the Bethnal Green Museum, and the answer he got was that at\r\npresent no appointment of a director is contemplated. I suppose they see\r\nno way of making it a Natural History Museum, and it will have to be\r\nkept going by Loan Collections of miscellaneous works of art, in which\r\ncase, of course, the South Kensington people will manage it. It is a\r\nconsiderable disappointment to me, as I had almost calculated on getting\r\nsomething there.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes for your good health and happiness, believe me, dear\r\nDarwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have just been reading Howorth's paper in the _Journal of the\r\nAnthropological Institute_. How perverse it is. He throughout confounds\r\n\"fertility\" with \"increase of population,\" which seems to me to be the\r\nmain cause of his errors. His elaborate accumulation of facts in other\r\npapers in _Nature_, on \"Subsidence and Elevation of Land,\" I believe to\r\nbe equally full of error, and utterly untrustworthy as a whole.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent.

Busk\r\ntold me that Sharpey had noticed the appearance of numerous Infusoria in\r\none of the solutions not containing any nitrogen; and I do not suppose\r\nthat any physiologist would admit the possibility of Infusoria absorbing\r\nnitrogen gas. Possibly I ought not to have mentioned statements made in\r\nprivate conversation, so please do not repeat them.\r\n\r\nI quite agree about the extreme importance of such men as Cohn\r\n[illegible] and Carter having observed apparent cases of heterogenesis.\r\nAt present I should prefer any mad hypothesis, such as that every\r\ndisintegrated molecule of the lowest forms can reproduce the\r\nparent-form, and that the molecules are universally distributed, and\r\nthat they do not lose their vital power until heated to such a\r\ntemperature that they decompose like dead organic particles.\r\n\r\nI am extremely grieved to hear about the Museum: it is a great\r\nmisfortune.--Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI have taken up old botanical work and have given up all theories.\r\n\r\nI quite agree about Howorth's paper: he wrote to me and I told him that\r\nwe differed so widely it was of no use our discussing any point.\r\n\r\nAs for Galton's paper, I have never yet been able to fully digest it: as\r\nfar as I have, it has not cleared my ideas, and has only aided in\r\nbringing more prominently forward the large proportion of the latent\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent.

Marshall, Zoological Assistant to Schlegel at\r\nLeyden. Neither the specimen nor extract need be returned; and you need\r\nnot acknowledge the receipt. The resemblance is not so close, now that\r\nthe fragments are gummed on card, as I at first thought. Your review of\r\nHouzeau was very good: I skimmed through the whole gigantic book, but\r\nyou managed to pick out the plums much better than I did for myself. You\r\nare a born critic. What an _admirable_ number that was of _Nature_.\r\n\r\nI am writing this at Sevenoaks, where we have taken a house for three\r\nweeks and have one more week to stay. We came here that I may get a\r\nlittle rest, of which I stood in much need.--Ever yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nWith respect to what you say about certain instincts of ants having been\r\nacquired by experience or sense, have you kept in mind that the neuters\r\nhave no progeny? I wish I knew whether the fertile females, or queens,\r\ndo the same work (viz. placing the eggs in warm places, etc.) as the\r\nneuters do afterwards; if so the case would be comparatively simple; but\r\nI believe this is not the case, and I am driven to selection of varying\r\npre-existing instincts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. November 15, 1872._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I should have written earlier to thank you for your\r\nbook,[94] but was hoping to be able to read more of it before doing so.\r\nI have not, however, found time to get beyond the first three chapters,\r\nbut that is quite sufficient to show me how exceedingly interesting you\r\nhave made the subject, and how completely and admirably you have worked\r\nit out. I expect it will be one of the most popular of your works. I\r\nhave just been asked to write a review of it for the _Quarterly Journal\r\nof Science_, for which purpose I shall be in duty bound to seek out some\r\ndeficiencies, however minute, so as to give my notice some flavour of\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nThe cuts and photos are admirable, and my little boy and girl seized it\r\nat once to look at the naughty babies.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I will take this opportunity of asking you if you know of any book\r\nthat will give me a complete catalogue of vertebrate fossils with some\r\nindication of their affinities.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. January 13, 1873._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have read your review with much interest, and I\r\nthank you sincerely for the very kind spirit in which it is written. I\r\ncannot say that I am convinced by your criticisms.[95] If you have ever\r\nactually observed a kitten sucking and pounding with extended toes its\r\nmother, and then seen the same kitten when a _little older_ doing the\r\nsame thing on a soft shawl, and ultimately an old cat (as I have seen),\r\nand do not admit that it is identically the same action, I am\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the decapitated frog,[96] I have always heard of Pflüger\r\nas a most trustworthy observer. If, indeed, anyone knows a frog's habits\r\nso well as to say that it never rubs off a bit of leaf or other object,\r\nwhich may stick to its thigh, in the same manner as it did the acid,\r\nyour objection would be valid. Some of Flourens' experiments, in which\r\nhe removed the cerebral hemisphere from a pigeon, indicate that acts\r\n_apparently_ performed consciously can be done without consciousness--I\r\npresume through the force of habit; in which case it would appear that\r\nintellectual power is not brought into play. Several persons have made\r\nsuch suggestions and objections as yours about the hands being held up\r\nin astonishment:[97] if there was any straining of the muscles, as with\r\nprotruded arms under fright, I would agree: as it is I must keep to my\r\nold opinion, and I daresay you will say that I am an obstinate old\r\nblockhead.--My dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nThe book has sold wonderfully; 9,000 copies have now been printed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. Wednesday morning, [November, 1873]._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Yours just received. Pray act exactly as if nothing had\r\nbeen said to me on the subject. I do not particularly _wish_ for the\r\nwork,[98] as, besides being as you say, tedious work, it involves a\r\nconsiderable amount of responsibility. Still, I am prepared to do any\r\nliterary work of the kind, as I told Bates some time ago, and that is\r\nthe reason he wrote to me about it. I certainly think, however, that it\r\nwould be in many ways more satisfactory to you if your son did it, and I\r\ntherefore hope he may undertake it.\r\n\r\nShould he, however, for any reasons, be unable, I am at your service as\r\na _dernier ressort_.\r\n\r\nIn case my meaning is not quite clear, I will _not do it_ unless your\r\nson has the offer and declines it.--Believe me, dear Darwin, yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED B. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. November 18, 1873._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--I quite understand what you require, and would undertake\r\nto do it to the best of my ability. Of course in such work I should not\r\nthink of offering criticisms of matter.\r\n\r\nI do not think I could form any idea of how long it would take by seeing\r\nthe MSS., as it would all depend upon the amount of revision and\r\nworking-in required. I have helped Sir C. Lyell with his last three or\r\nfour editions in a somewhat similar though different way, and for him I\r\nhave kept an account simply of the hours I was employed in any way for\r\nhim, and he paid me 5/- an hour; but (of course this is confidential) I\r\ndo not think this quite enough for the class of work. I should propose\r\nfor your work 7/- an hour as a fair remuneration, and I would put down\r\neach day the hours I worked at it.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you will get it done for very much less by any literary man\r\naccustomed to regular literary work and nothing else, and perhaps better\r\ndone, so do not in the least scruple in saying you decide on employing\r\nthe gentleman you had in view if you prefer it.\r\n\r\nIf you send it to me could you let me have _all_ your MSS. copied out,\r\nas it adds considerably to the time required if there is any difficulty\r\nin deciphering the writing, which in yours (as you are no doubt aware)\r\nthere often is.\r\n\r\nMy hasty note to Bates was not intended to be shown you or anyone. I\r\nthought he had heard of it from Murray, and that the arrangement was to\r\nbe made by Murray.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have been delighted with H. Spencer's \"Study of Sociology.\" Some\r\nof the passages in the latter part are _grand_. You have perhaps seen\r\nthat I am dipping into politics myself occasionally.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenkam, Kent. November 19, 1873._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,--I thank you for your extremely kind letter, and I am\r\nsorry that I troubled you with that of yesterday. My wife thinks that my\r\nson George would be so much pleased at undertaking the work for me, that\r\nI will write to him, and so probably shall have no occasion to trouble\r\nyou. If on still further reflection, and after looking over my notes, I\r\nthink that my son could not do the work, I will write again and\r\n_gratefully_ accept your proposal. But if you do not hear, you will\r\nunderstand that I can manage the affair myself. I never in my lifetime\r\nregretted an interruption so much as this new edition of the \"Descent.\"\r\nI am deeply immersed in some work on physiological points with plants.\r\n\r\nI fully agree with what you say about H. Spencer's \"Sociology\"; I do not\r\nbelieve there is a man in Europe at all his equal in talents. I did not\r\nknow that you had been writing on politics, except so far as your letter\r\non the coal question, which interested me much and struck me as a\r\ncapital letter.\r\n\r\nI must again thank you for your letter, and remain, dear Wallace, yours\r\nvery sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI hope to Heaven that politics will not replace natural science.\r\n\r\nI know too well how atrociously bad my handwriting is.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. December 6, 1874._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for your kindness in sending me a copy of your\r\nnew edition of the \"Descent.\" I see you have made a whole host of\r\nadditions and corrections which I shall have great pleasure in reading\r\nover as soon as I have got rid of my horrid book on Geographical\r\nDistribution, which is almost driving me mad with the amount of drudgery\r\nrequired and the often unsatisfactory nature of the result. However, I\r\nmust finish with it soon, or all the part first done will have to be\r\ndone over again, every new book, either as a monograph, or a\r\nclassification, putting everything wrong (for me).\r\n\r\nHoping you are in good health and able to go on with your favourite\r\nwork, I remain yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED B.

July 21, 1875._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for your kindness in sending me a copy of your\r\nnew book.[99] Being very busy I have only had time to dip into it yet.\r\nThe account of Utricularia is most marvellous, and quite new to me. I'm\r\nrather surprised that you do not make any remarks on the origin of these\r\nextraordinary contrivances for capturing insects. Did you think they\r\nwere too obvious? I daresay there is no difficulty, but I feel sure they\r\nwill be seized on as inexplicable by Natural Selection, and your silence\r\non the point will be held to show that you consider them so! The\r\ncontrivance in Utricularia and Dionæa, and in fact in Drosera too, seems\r\nfully as great and complex as in Orchids, but there is not the same\r\nmotive force. Fertilisation and cross-fertilisation are important ends\r\nenough to lead to _any_ modification, but can we suppose mere\r\nnourishment to be so important, seeing that it is so easily and almost\r\nuniversally obtained by extrusion of roots and leaves? Here are plants\r\nwhich lose their roots and leaves to acquire the same results by\r\ninfinitely complex modes! What a wonderful and long-continued series of\r\nvariations must have led up to the perfect \"trap\" in Utricularia, while\r\nat any stage of the process the same end might have been gained by a\r\nlittle more development of roots and leaves, as in 9,999 plants out of\r\n10,000!\r\n\r\nIs this an imaginary difficulty, or do you mean to deal with it in\r\nfuture editions of the \"Origin\"?--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. November 7, 1875._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for your beautiful little volume on \"Climbing\r\nPlants,\" which forms a most interesting companion to your \"Orchids\" and\r\n\"Insectivorous Plants.\" I am sorry to see that you have not this time\r\ngiven us the luxury of cut edges.\r\n\r\nI am in the midst of printing and proof-sheets, which are wearisome in\r\nthe extreme from the mass of names and statistics I have been obliged to\r\nintroduce, and which will, I fear, make my book insufferably dull to all\r\nbut zoological specialists.\r\n\r\nMy trust is in my pictures and maps to catch the public.\r\n\r\nHoping yourself and all your family are quite well, believe me yours\r\nvery faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

June 5, 1876._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I must have the pleasure of expressing to you my\r\nunbounded admiration of your book,[100] though I have read only to page\r\n184--my object having been to do as little as possible while resting. I\r\nfeel sure that you have laid a broad and safe foundation for all future\r\nwork on Distribution. How interesting it will be to see hereafter plants\r\ntreated in strict relation to your views; and then all insects,\r\npulmonate molluscs, and fresh-water fishes, in greater detail than I\r\nsuppose you have given to these lower animals. The point which has\r\ninterested me most, but I do not say the most valuable point, is your\r\nprotest against sinking imaginary continents in a quite reckless manner,\r\nas was started by Forbes, followed, alas, by Hooker, and caricatured by\r\nWollaston and Murray. By the way, the main impression which the latter\r\nauthor has left on my mind is his utter want of all scientific judgment.\r\nI have lifted up my voice against the above view with no avail, but I\r\nhave no doubt that you will succeed, owing to your new arguments and the\r\ncoloured chart. Of a special value, as it seems to me, is the conclusion\r\nthat we must determine the areas chiefly by the nature of the mammals.\r\nWhen I worked many years ago on this subject, I doubted much whether the\r\nnow-called Palearctic and Nearctic regions ought to be separated; and I\r\ndetermined if I made another region that it should be Madagascar. I have\r\ntherefore been able to appreciate the value of your evidence on these\r\npoints. What progress Palæontology has made during the last 20 years!\r\nBut if it advances at the same rate in the future, our views on the\r\nmigration and birthplace of the various groups will, I fear, be greatly\r\naltered. I cannot feel quite easy about the Glacial period and the\r\nextinction of large mammals, but I much hope that you are right. I think\r\nyou will have to modify your belief about the difficulty of dispersal of\r\nland molluscs; I was interrupted when beginning to experimentise on the\r\njust-hatched young adhering to the feet of ground-roosting birds. I\r\ndiffer on one other point, viz. in the belief that there must have\r\nexisted a Tertiary Antarctic continent, from which various forms\r\nradiated to the southern extremities of our present continents. But I\r\ncould go on scribbling for ever. You have written, as I believe, a grand\r\nand memorable work, which will last for years as the foundation for all\r\nfuture treatises on Geographical Distribution,--My dear Wallace, yours\r\nvery sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You have paid me the highest conceivable compliment by what you\r\nsay of your work in relation to my chapters on Distribution in the\r\n\"Origin,\" and I heartily thank you for it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. June 7, 1876._\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,--Many thanks for your very kind letter. So few people will\r\nread my book at all regularly, that a criticism from one who does so\r\nwill be very welcome.\r\n\r\nIf, as I suppose, it is only to p. 184 of Vol. I. that you have read,\r\nyou cannot yet quite see my conclusions on the points you refer to (land\r\nmolluscs and Antarctic continent). My own conclusions fluctuated during\r\nthe progress of the book, and I have, I know, occasionally used\r\nexpressions (the relics of earlier ideas) which are not quite consistent\r\nwith what I say further on. I am positively against any Southern\r\ncontinent as _uniting_ South America with Australia or New Zealand, as\r\nyou will see at Vol. I., pp. 398-403 and 459-466. My general conclusions\r\nas to Distribution of Land Mollusca[101] are at Vol. II., pp. 522-529.\r\nWhen you have read these passages and looked at the general facts which\r\nlead to them, I shall be glad to hear if you still differ from me.\r\n\r\nThough, of course, _present results_ as to origin and migrations of\r\ngenera of mammals will have to be modified owing to new discoveries, I\r\ncannot help thinking that much will remain unaffected, because in all\r\ngeographical and geological discoveries the great outlines are soon\r\nreached; the details alone remain to be modified. I also think much of\r\nthe geological evidence is now so accordant with, and explanatory of,\r\ngeographical distribution that it is prima facie correct in outline.\r\nNevertheless, such vast masses of new facts will come out in the next\r\nfew years that I quite dread the labour of incorporating them in a new\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nNow for a little personal matter. For two years I have made up my mind\r\nto leave this place--mainly for two reasons: drought and wind prevent\r\nthe satisfactory growth of all delicate plants; and I cannot stand being\r\nunable to attend evening meetings and being obliged to refuse every\r\ninvitation in London. But I was obliged to stay till I had got it into\r\ndecent order to attract a customer. At last it is so, and I am offering\r\nit for sale, and as soon as it is disposed of I intend to try the\r\nneighbourhood of Dorking, whence there are late trains from Cannon\r\nStreet and Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nI see your post-mark was Dorking, so I suppose you have been staying\r\nthere. Is it not a lovely country? I hope your health is improved, and\r\nwhen, quite at your leisure, you have waded through my book, I trust\r\nyou will again let me have a few lines of friendly criticism and\r\nadvice.--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham. June 17, 1876._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have now finished the whole of Vol. I., with the\r\nsame interest and admiration as before; and I am convinced that my\r\njudgment was right and that it is a memorable book, the basis of all\r\nfuture work on the subject. I have nothing particular to say, but\r\nperhaps you would like to hear my impressions on two or three points.\r\nNothing has struck me more than the admirable and convincing manner in\r\nwhich you treat Java. To allude to a very trifling point, it is capital\r\nabout the unadorned head of the Argus pheasant.[102] How plain a thing is,\r\nwhen it is once pointed out! What a wonderful case is that of Celebes! I\r\nam glad that you have slightly modified your views with respect to\r\nAfrica,[103] and this leads me to say that I cannot swallow the so-called\r\ncontinent of Lemuria, i.e. the direct connection of Africa and\r\nCeylon![104] The facts do not seem to me many and strong enough to justify\r\nso immense a change of level. Moreover, Mauritius and the other islands\r\nappear to me oceanic in character. But do not suppose that I place my\r\njudgment on this subject on a level with yours. A wonderfully good paper\r\nwas published about a year ago on India in the _Geological Journal_--I\r\n_think_ by Blandford.[105] Ramsay agreed with me that it was one of the\r\nbest published for a long time. The author shows that India has been a\r\ncontinent with enormous fresh-water lakes from the Permian period to the\r\npresent day. If I remember right he believes in a former connection with\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nI am sure that I read, some 20 to 30 years ago, in a French journal, an\r\naccount of teeth of mastodon found in Timor; but the statement may have\r\nbeen an error.\r\n\r\nWith respect to what you say about the colonising of New Zealand, I\r\nsomewhere have an account of a frog frozen in the ice of a Swiss\r\nglacier, and which revived when thawed. I may add that there is an\r\nIndian toad which can resist salt water and haunts the seaside. Nothing\r\never astonished me more than the case of the Galaxias; but it does not\r\nseem known whether it may not be a migratory fish like the salmon. It\r\nseems to me that you complicate rather too much the successive\r\ncolonisations with New Zealand. I should prefer believing that the\r\nGalaxias was a species, like the Emys of the Sewalik Hills, which has\r\nlong retained the same form. Your remarks on the insects and flowers of\r\nNew Zealand have greatly interested me; but aromatic leaves I have\r\nalways looked at as a protection against their being eaten by insects or\r\nother animals; and as insects are there rare, such protection would not\r\nbe much needed. I have written more than I intended, and I must again\r\nsay how profoundly your book has interested me.\r\n\r\nNow let me turn to a very different subject. I have only just heard of\r\nand procured your two articles in the _Academy_. I thank you most\r\ncordially for your generous defence of me against Mr. Mivart. In the\r\n\"Origin\" I did not discuss the derivation of any one species; but that I\r\nmight not be accused of concealing my opinion I went out of my way and\r\ninserted a sentence which seemed to me (and still so seems) to declare\r\nplainly my belief. This was quoted in my \"Descent of Man.\" Therefore it\r\nis very unjust, not to say dishonest, of Mr. Mivart to accuse me of base\r\nfraudulent concealment; I care little about myself; but Mr. Mivart, in\r\nan article in the _Quarterly Review_ (which I _know_ was written by\r\nhim), accused my son George of encouraging profligacy, and this without\r\nthe least foundation.[106] I can assert this positively, as I laid\r\nGeorge's article and the _Quarterly Review_ before Hooker, Huxley and\r\nothers, and all agreed that the accusation was a deliberate\r\nfalsification. Huxley wrote to him on the subject and has almost or\r\nquite cut him in consequence; and so would Hooker, but he was advised\r\nnot to do so as President of the Royal Society. Well, he has gained his\r\nobject in giving me pain, and, good God, to think of the flattering,\r\nalmost fawning speeches which he has made to me! I wrote, of course, to\r\nhim to say that I would never speak to him again. I ought, however, to\r\nbe contented, as he is the one man who has ever, as far as I know,\r\ntreated me basely.\r\n\r\nForgive me for writing at such length, and believe me yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I am very sorry that you have given up sexual selection. I am not\r\nat all shaken, and stick to my colours like a true Briton. When I think\r\nabout the unadorned head of the Argus pheasant, I might exclaim, _Et tu,\r\nBrute!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham. June 25, 1876._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have been able to read rather more quickly of late\r\nand have finished your book. I have not much to say. Your careful\r\naccount of the temperate parts of South America interested me much, and\r\nall the more from knowing something of the country. I like also much the\r\ngeneral remarks towards the end of the volume on the land molluscs. Now\r\nfor a few criticisms.\r\n\r\nP. 122:[107] I am surprised at your saying that \"during the whole Tertiary\r\nperiod North America was zoologically far more strongly contrasted with\r\nSouth America than it is now.\" But we know hardly anything of the latter\r\nexcept during the Pliocene period, and then the mastodon, horse, several\r\ngreat Dentata, etc. etc., were common to the North and South. If you are\r\nright I erred greatly in my Journal, where I insisted on the former\r\nclose connection between the two.\r\n\r\nP. 252, and elsewhere: I agree thoroughly with the general principle\r\nthat a great area with many competing forms is necessary for much and\r\nhigh development; but do you not extend this principle too far--I should\r\nsay much too far, considering how often several species of the same\r\ngenus have been developed on very small islands?\r\n\r\nP. 265: You say that the Sittidæ extend to Madagascar, but there is no\r\nnumber in the tabular heading.[108]\r\n\r\nP. 359: Rhinochetus is entered in the tabular heading under No. 3 of the\r\n_Neotropical_ sub-regions.[109]\r\n\r\nReviewers think it necessary to find some fault, and if I were to review\r\nyou, the sole point which I should blame is your not giving very\r\nnumerous references. These would save whoever follows you great labour.\r\nOccasionally I wished myself to know the authority for certain\r\nstatements, and whether you or somebody else had originated certain\r\nsubordinate views. Take the case of a man who had collected largely on\r\nsome island, for instance St. Helena, and who wished to work out the\r\ngeographical relations of his collection; he would, I think, feel very\r\nblank at not finding in your work precise references to all that had\r\nbeen written on St. Helena. I hope you will not think me a confoundedly\r\ndisagreeable fellow.\r\n\r\nI may mention a capital essay which I received a few mouths ago from\r\nAxel Blytt[110] on the distribution of the plants of Scandinavia; showing\r\nthe high probability of there having been secular periods alternately\r\nwet and dry; and of the important part which they have played in\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Forel, who is always at work on ants, and told him of your\r\nviews about the dispersal of the blind Coleoptera, and asked him to\r\nobserve.\r\n\r\nI spoke to Hooker about your book, and feel sure that he would like\r\nnothing better than to consider the distribution of plants in relation\r\nto your views; but he seemed to doubt whether he should ever have time.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have done my jottings, and once again congratulate you on\r\nhaving brought out so grand a work. I have been a little disappointed at\r\nthe review in _Nature_[111]--My dear Wallace, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Rose Hill, Dorking. July 23, 1876._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I should have replied sooner to your last kind and\r\ninteresting letters, but they reached me in the midst of my packing\r\nprevious to removal here, and I have only just now got my books and\r\npapers in a get-at-able state.\r\n\r\nAnd first, many thanks for your close observation in detecting the two\r\nabsurd mistakes in the tabular headings.\r\n\r\nAs to the former greater distinction of the North and South American\r\nfaunas, I think I am right. The Edentata, being proved (as I hold) to\r\nhave been mere temporary migrants into North America in the\r\npost-Pliocene epoch, form no part of its Tertiary fauna. Yet in South\r\nAmerica they were so enormously developed in the Pliocene epoch that we\r\nknow, if there is any such thing as Evolution, etc., that strange\r\nancestral forms must have preceded them in Miocene times.\r\n\r\nMastodon, on the other hand, represented by one or two species only,\r\nappears to have been a late immigrant into South America from the North.\r\n\r\nThe immense development of Ungulates (in varied families, genera, and\r\nspecies) in North America during the whole Tertiary epoch is, however,\r\nthe great feature, which assimilates it to Europe and contrasts it with\r\nSouth America. True camels, hosts of hog-like animals, true\r\nrhinoceroses, and hosts of ancestral horses, all bring North America\r\nmuch nearer to the Old World than it is now. Even the horse, represented\r\nin all South America by Equus only, was probably a temporary immigrant\r\nfrom the North.\r\n\r\nAs to extending too far the principle (yours) of the necessity of\r\ncomparatively large areas for the development of varied faunas, I may\r\nhave done so, but I think not. There is, I think, every probability that\r\nmost islands, etc., where a varied fauna now exists have been once more\r\nextensive, e.g. New Zealand, Madagascar. Where there is no such evidence\r\n(e.g. Galapagos), the fauna is _very restricted_.\r\n\r\nLastly as to want of references; I confess the justice of your\r\ncriticism. But I am dreadfully unsystematic. It is my first large work\r\ninvolving much of the labour of others. I began with the intention of\r\nwriting a comparatively short sketch, enlarged it, and added to it, bit\r\nby bit; remodelled the tables, the headings, and almost everything else,\r\nmore than once, and got my materials into such confusion that it is a\r\nwonder it has not turned out far more crooked and confused than it is.\r\nI, no doubt, ought to have given references; but in many cases I found\r\nthe information so small and scattered, and so much had to be combined\r\nand condensed from conflicting authorities, that I hardly knew how to\r\nrefer to them or where to leave off. Had I referred to all authors\r\nconsulted for every fact, I should have greatly increased the bulk of\r\nthe book, while a large portion of the references would be valueless in\r\na few years owing to later and better authorities. My experience of\r\nreferring to references has generally been most unsatisfactory. One\r\nfinds, nine times out of ten, the fact is stated, and nothing more; or\r\na reference to some third work not at hand!\r\n\r\nI wish I could get into the habit of giving chapter and verse for every\r\nfact and extract, but I am too lazy and generally in a hurry, having to\r\nconsult books against time when in London for a day.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will try and do something to mend this matter should I have\r\nto prepare another edition.\r\n\r\nI return you Forel's letter. It does not advance the question much,\r\nneither do I think it likely that even the complete observation he\r\nthinks necessary would be of much use; because it may well be that the\r\nova or larvæ or imagos of the beetles are not carried systematically by\r\nthe ants, but only occasionally owing to some exceptional circumstances.\r\nThis might produce a great effect in distribution, yet be so rare as\r\nnever to come under observation.\r\n\r\nSeveral of your remarks in previous letters I shall carefully consider.\r\nI know that, compared with the extent of the subject, my book is in many\r\nparts crude and ill-considered; but I thought, and still think, it\r\nbetter to make _some generalisations_ wherever possible, as I am not at\r\nall afraid of having to alter my views in many points of detail. I was\r\nso overwhelmed with zoological details that I never went through the\r\nGeological Society's _Journal_ as I ought to have done, and as I mean to\r\ndo before writing more on the subject.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Rose Hill, Dorking. December 13, 1876._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--Many thanks for your new book on \"Crossing Plants,\"\r\nwhich I have read with much interest. I hardly expected, however, that\r\nthere would have been so many doubtful and exceptional cases. I fancy\r\nthat the results would have come out better had you always taken\r\nweights instead of heights; and that would have obviated the objection\r\nthat will, I daresay, be made, that _height_ proves nothing, because a\r\ntall plant may be weaker, less bulky and less vigorous than a shorter\r\none. Of course no one who knows you or who takes a _general_ view of\r\nyour results will say this, but I daresay it will be said. I am afraid\r\nthis book will not do much or anything to get rid of the one great\r\nobjection, that the physiological characteristic of species, the\r\ninfertility of hybrids, has not yet been produced. Have you ever tried\r\nexperiments with plants (if any can be found) which for several\r\ncenturies have been grown under very different conditions, as for\r\ninstance potatoes on the high Andes and in Ireland? If any approach to\r\nsterility occurred in mongrels between these it would be a grand step.\r\nThe most curious point you have brought out seems to me the slight\r\nsuperiority of self-fertilisation over fertilisation with another flower\r\nof the same plant, and the most important result, that difference of\r\nconstitution is the essence of the benefit of cross-fertilisation. All\r\nyou now want is to find the neutral point where the benefit is at its\r\nmaximum, any greater difference being prejudicial.\r\n\r\nHoping you may yet demonstrate this, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Rose Hill, Dorking. January 17, 1877._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--Many thanks for your valuable new edition of the\r\n\"Orchids,\" which I see contains a great deal of new matter of the\r\ngreatest interest. I am amazed at your continuous work, but I suppose,\r\nafter all these years of it, it is impossible for you to remain idle. I,\r\non the contrary, am very idle, and feel inclined to do nothing but\r\nstroll about this beautiful country, and read all kinds of miscellaneous\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nI have asked my friend Mr. Mott to send you the last of his remarkable\r\npapers--on Haeckel. But the part I hope you will read with as much\r\ninterest as I have done is that on the deposits of Carbon, and the part\r\nit has played and must be playing in geological changes. He seems to\r\nhave got the idea from some German book, but it seems to me very\r\nimportant, and I wonder it never occurred to Sir Charges Lyell. If the\r\ncalculations as to the quantity of undecomposed carbon deposited are\r\nanything approaching to correctness, the results must be important.\r\n\r\nHoping you are in pretty good health, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Rose Hill, Dorking. July 23, 1877._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--Many thanks for your admirable volume on \"The Forms of\r\nFlowers.\" It would be impertinence of me to say anything in praise of\r\nit, except that I have read the chapters on \"Illegitimate Offspring of\r\nHeterostyled Plants\" and on \"Cleistogamic Flowers\" with great interest.\r\n\r\nI am almost afraid to tell you that in going over the subject of the\r\nColours of Animals, etc., for a small volume of essays, etc., I am\r\npreparing, I have come to conclusions directly opposed to _voluntary\r\nsexual selection_, and believe that I can explain (in a general way)\r\n_all_ the phenomena of sexual ornaments and colours by laws of\r\ndevelopment aided by simple Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nI hope you admire as I do Mr. Belt's remarkable series of papers in\r\nsupport of his terrific \"oceanic glacier river-damming\" hypothesis. In\r\nawful grandeur it beats everything \"glacial\" yet out, and it certainly\r\nexplains a wonderful lot of hard facts. The last one, on the \"Glacial\r\nPeriod in the Southern Hemisphere,\" in the _Quarterly Journal of\r\nScience_, is particularly fine, and I see he has just read a paper at\r\nthe Geological Society. It seems to me supported by quite as much\r\nevidence as Ramsay's \"Lakes\"; but Ramsay, I understand, will have none\r\nof it--as yet.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. August 31, 1877._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I am very much obliged to you for sending your\r\narticle, which is very interesting and appears to me as clearly written\r\nas it can be. You will not be surprised that I differ altogether from\r\nyou about sexual colours. That the tail of the peacock and his elaborate\r\ndisplay of it should be due merely to the vigour, activity, and vitality\r\nof the male is to me as utterly incredible as my views are to you.\r\nMantegazza published a few years ago in Italy a somewhat similar view. I\r\ncannot help doubting about recognition through colour; our horses, dogs,\r\nfowls, and pigeons seem to know their own species, however differently\r\nthe individuals may be coloured. I wonder whether you attribute the\r\nodoriferous and sound-producing organs, when confined to the males, to\r\ntheir greater vigour, etc.? I could say a good deal in opposition to\r\nyou, but my arguments would have no weight in your eyes, and I do not\r\nintend to write for the public anything on this or any other difficult\r\nsubject. By the way, I doubt whether the term voluntary in relation to\r\nsexual selection ought to be employed: when a man is fascinated by a\r\npretty girl it can hardly be called voluntary, and I suppose that female\r\nanimals are charmed or excited in nearly the same manner by the gaudy\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nThree essays have been published lately in Germany which would interest\r\nyou: one by Weismann, who shows that the coloured stripes on the\r\ncaterpillars of Sphinx are beautifully protective: and birds were\r\nfrightened away from their feeding-place by a caterpillar with large\r\neye-like spots on the broad anterior segments of the body. Fritz Müller\r\nhas well discussed the first steps of mimicry with butterflies, and\r\ncomes to nearly or quite the same conclusion as you, but supports it by\r\nadditional arguments.\r\n\r\nFritz Müller also has lately shown that the males alone of certain\r\nbutterflies have odoriferous glands on their wings (distinct from those\r\nwhich secrete matter disgusting to birds), and where these glands are\r\nplaced the scales assume a different shape, making little tufts.\r\n\r\nFarewell: I hope that you find Dorking a pleasant place? I was staying\r\nlately at Abinger Hall, and wished to come over to see you, but driving\r\ntires me so much that my courage failed.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Madeira Villa, Madeira Road, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. September 3,\r\n1877._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--Many thanks for your letter. Of course I did not expect\r\nmy paper to have any effect on your opinions. You have looked at all the\r\nfacts so long from your special point of view that it would require\r\nconclusive arguments to influence you, and these, from the complex\r\nnature of the question, are probably not to be had. We must, I think,\r\nleave the case in the hands of others, and I am in hopes that my paper\r\nmay call sufficient attention to the subject to induce some of the great\r\nschool of Darwinians to take the question up and work it out thoroughly.\r\nYou have brought such a mass of facts to support your view, and have\r\nargued it so fully, that I hardly think it necessary for you to do more.\r\nTruth will prevail, as you as well as I wish it to do. I will only make\r\none or two remarks. The word \"voluntary\" was inserted in _my proofs\r\nonly_, in order to distinguish clearly between the two radically\r\ndistinct kinds of \"sexual selection.\" Perhaps \"conscious\" would be a\r\nbetter word, to which I think you will not object, and I will alter it\r\nwhen I republish. I lay no stress on the word \"voluntary.\"\r\n\r\nSound- and scent-producing organs in males are surely due to \"natural\"\r\nor \"automatic\" as opposed to \"conscious\" selection. If there were\r\ngradations in the sounds produced, from mere noises, up to elaborate\r\nmusic--the case would be analogous to that of \"colours\" and \"ornament.\"\r\nBeing, however, comparatively simple, Natural Selection, owing to their\r\nuse as a guide, seems sufficient. The louder sound, heard at a greater\r\ndistance, would attract or be heard by more females, or it may attract\r\nother males and lead to combats _for_ the females, but this would not\r\nimply _choice_ in the sense of rejecting a male whose stridulation was a\r\ntrifle less loud than another's, which is the essence of the theory as\r\napplied by you to colour and ornament. But greater general vigour would\r\nalmost certainly lead to greater volume or persistence of sound, and so\r\nthe same view will apply to both cases on my theory.\r\n\r\nThanks for the references you give me. My ignorance of German prevents\r\nme supporting my views by the mass of observations continually being\r\nmade abroad, so I can only advance my own ideas for what they are worth.\r\n\r\nI like Dorking much, but can find no house to suit me, so fear I shall\r\nhave to move again.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. September 5, [1877]._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--\"Conscious\" seems to me much better than \"voluntary.\"\r\nConscious action, I presume, comes into play when two males fight for a\r\nfemale; but I do not know whether you admit that, for instance, the\r\nspur of the cock is due to sexual selection.\r\n\r\nI am quite willing to admit that the sounds and vocal organs of some\r\nmales are used only for challenging, but I doubt whether this applies to\r\nthe musical notes of Hylobates or to the howling (I judge chiefly from\r\nRengger) of the American monkeys. No account that I have seen of the\r\nstridulation of male insects shows that it is a challenge. All those who\r\nhave attended to birds consider their song as a charm to the females and\r\nnot as a challenge. As the males in most cases search for the females I\r\ndo not see how their odoriferous organs will aid them in finding the\r\nfemales. But it is foolish in me to go on writing, for I believe I have\r\nsaid most of this in my book: anyhow, I well remember thinking over it.\r\nThe \"belling\" of male stags, if I remember rightly, is a challenge, and\r\nso I daresay is the roaring of the lion during the breeding season.\r\n\r\nI will just add in reference to your former letter that I fully admit\r\nthat with birds the fighting of the males co-operates with their charms;\r\nand I remember quoting Bartlett that gaudy colouring in the males is\r\nalmost invariably concomitant with pugnacity. But, thank Heaven, what\r\nlittle more I can do in science will be confined to observation on\r\nsimple points. However much I may have blundered, I have done my best,\r\nand that is my constant comfort.--Most truly yours,\r\n\r\nC.

I have\r\nsome hopes of success, but am rather doubtful of the Committee of the\r\nCorporation who will have the management, for they have just decided\r\nafter a great struggle in the Court of Common Council that it is to be a\r\nrotatory Committee, every member of the Council (of whom there are 200)\r\ncoming on it in succession if they please. They evidently look upon it\r\nas a Committee which will have great opportunities of excursions,\r\npicnics, and dinners, at the expense of the Corporation, while the\r\nimprovement of the Forest will be quite a secondary matter.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear you are tolerably well.

January 5, 1880._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--As this note requires no sort of answer, you must\r\nallow me to express my lively admiration of your paper in the\r\n_Nineteenth Century_.[112] You certainly are a master in the difficult art\r\nof clear exposition. It is impossible to urge too often that the\r\nselection from a single varying individual or of a single varying organ\r\nwill not suffice. You have worked in capitally Allen's admirable\r\nresearches. As usual, you delight to honour me more than I deserve. When\r\nI have written about the extreme slowness of Natural Selection (in which\r\nI hope I may be wrong), I have chiefly had in my mind the effects of\r\nintercrossing. I subscribe to almost everything you say excepting the\r\nlast short sentence.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me add how grieved I was to hear that the City of London did\r\nnot elect you for the Epping office, but I suppose it was too much to\r\nhope that such a body of men should make a good selection. I wish you\r\ncould obtain some quiet post and thus have leisure for moderate\r\nscientific work. I have nothing to tell you about myself; I see few\r\npersons, for conversation fatigues me much; but I daily do some work in\r\nexperiments on plants, and hope thus to continue to the end of my days.\r\n\r\nWith all good wishes, believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Have you seen Mr. Farrer's article in the last _Fortnightly_? It\r\nreminded me of an article on bequests by you some years ago which\r\ninterested and almost converted me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Waldron Edge, Duppas Hill, Croydon. January 9, 1880._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--It is a great pleasure to receive a letter from you\r\nsometimes--especially when we do not differ very much. I am, of course,\r\nmuch pleased and gratified that you like my article. I wrote it chiefly\r\nbecause I thought there was something a little fresh still to say on the\r\nsubject, and also because I wished to define precisely my present\r\nposition, which people continually misunderstand. The main part of the\r\narticle forms part of a chapter of a book I have now almost finished on\r\nmy favourite subject of \"Geographical Distribution.\" It will form a sort\r\nof supplement to my former work, and will, I trust, be more readable and\r\npopular. I go pretty fully into the laws of variation and dispersal; the\r\nexact character of specific and generic areas, and their causes; the\r\ngrowth, dispersal and extinction of species and groups, illustrated by\r\nmaps, etc.; changes of geography and of climate as affecting dispersal,\r\nwith a full discussion of the Glacial theory, adopting Croll's views\r\n(part of this has been published as a separate article in the _Quarterly\r\nReview_ of last July, and has been highly approved by Croll and Geikie);\r\na discussion of the theory of permanent continents and oceans, which I\r\nsee you were the first to adopt, but which geologists, I am sorry to\r\nsay, quite ignore. All this is preliminary. Then follows a series of\r\nchapters on the different kinds of islands, continental and oceanic,\r\nwith a pretty full discussion of the characters, affinities, and origin\r\nof their fauna and flora in typical cases. Among these I am myself quite\r\npleased with my chapters on New Zealand, as I believe I have fully\r\nexplained and accounted for _all_ the main peculiarities of the New\r\nZealand and Australian floras. I call the book \"Island Life,\" etc. etc.,\r\nand I think it will be interesting.\r\n\r\nThanks for your regrets and kind wishes anent Epping. It was a\r\ndisappointment, as I had good friends on the Committee and therefore had\r\ntoo much hope. I may just mention that I am thinking of making some\r\napplication through friends for some post in the new Josiah Mason\r\nCollege of Science at Birmingham, as Registrar or Curator and Librarian,\r\netc. The Trustees have advertised for Professors to begin next October.\r\nShould you happen to know any of the Trustees, or have any influential\r\nfriends in Birmingham, perhaps you could help me.\r\n\r\nI think this book will be my last, as I have pretty well said all I have\r\nto say in it, and I have never taken to experiment as you have. But I\r\nwant some easy occupation for my declining years, with not too much\r\nconfinement or desk-work, which I cannot stand. You see I had some\r\nreason for writing to you; but do not you trouble to write again unless\r\nyou have something to communicate.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nI have not seen the _Fortnightly_ yet, but will do so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pen-y-bryn, St. Peter's Road, Croydon.

The first five chapters you need not read, as they contain\r\nnothing fresh to you, but are necessary to make the work complete in\r\nitself. The next five chapters, however (VII. to X.), I think, will\r\ninterest you. As I _think_, in Chapters VIII. and IX. I have found the\r\ntrue explanation of geological climates, and on this I shall be very\r\nglad of your candid opinion, as it is the very foundation-stone of the\r\nbook. The rest will not contain much that is fresh to you, except the\r\nthree chapters on New Zealand. Sir Joseph Hooker thinks my theory of\r\nthe Australian and New Zealand floras a decided advance on anything that\r\nhas been done before.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this, the chapter on the Azores should be read.\r\n\r\nChap. XVI. on the British Fauna may also interest you.\r\n\r\nI mention these points merely that you may not trouble yourself to read\r\nthe whole book, unless you like.\r\n\r\nHoping that you are well, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

It is quite excellent, and seems to me the best book which you\r\nhave ever published; but this may be merely because I have read it last.\r\nAs I went on, I made a few notes,[114] chiefly when I differed strongly\r\nfrom you; but God knows whether they are worth your reading. You will be\r\ndisappointed with many of them; but they will show that I had the will,\r\nthough I did not know the way, to do what you wanted.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing on the infinitely many passages and views which I\r\nadmired and which were new to me. My notes are badly expressed; but I\r\nthought that you would excuse my taking any pains with my style. I wish\r\nthat my confounded handwriting was better.\r\n\r\nI had a note the other day from Hooker, and I can see that he is _much_\r\npleased with the Dedication.\r\n\r\nWith all good wishes, believe me yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nIn two or three weeks you will receive a book from me; if you care to\r\nknow what it is about, read the paragraph in Introduction about new\r\nterms and then the last chapter, and you will know whole contents of\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pen-y-bryn, St. Peter's Road, Croydon. November 8, 1880._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--Many thanks for your kind remarks and notes on my book.\r\nSeveral of the latter will be of use to me if I have to prepare a second\r\nedition, which I am not so sure of as you seem to be.\r\n\r\n1. In your remark as to the doubtfulness of paucity of fossils being due\r\nto coldness of water, I think you overlook that I am speaking _only_ of\r\nwaters in the latitude of the Alps, in Miocene and Eocene times, when\r\nicebergs and glaciers temporarily descended into an otherwise warm sea;\r\nmy theory being that there was no glacial epoch at that time, but merely\r\na local and temporary descent of the snow-line and glaciers owing to\r\nhigh excentricity and winter in _aphelion_.\r\n\r\n2. I cannot see the difficulty about the cessation of the glacial\r\nperiod. Between the Miocene and the Pleistocene periods geographical\r\nchanges occurred which rendered a true glacial period possible with\r\nhigh excentricity. When the high excentricity passed away the glacial\r\nepoch also passed away in the Temperate zone; but it persists in the\r\nArctic zone, where during the Miocene there were mild climates, and this\r\nis due to the persistence of the changed geographical conditions. The\r\npresent Arctic climate is itself a comparatively new and abnormal state\r\nof things due to geographical modification. As to \"epoch\" and \"period,\"\r\nI use them as synonyms to avoid repeating the same word.\r\n\r\n3. Rate of deposit and geological time: there no doubt I may have gone\r\nto an extreme, but my \"twenty-eight million years\" may be anything under\r\n100 millions, as I state. There is an enormous difference between _mean_\r\nand _maximum_ denudation and deposition. In the case of the great faults\r\nthe upheaval along a given line would itself facilitate the denudation\r\n(whether subaerial or marine) of the upheaved portion at a rate perhaps\r\na hundred times faster than plains and plateaux. So, local subsidence\r\nmight itself lead to very rapid deposition. Suppose a portion of the\r\nGulf of Mexico near the mouth of the Mississippi were to subside for a\r\nfew thousand years, it might receive the greater part of the sediment\r\nfrom the whole Mississippi valley, and thus form strata at a very rapid\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n4. You quote the Pampas thistles, etc., against my statement of the\r\nimportance of preoccupation. But I am referring especially to St.\r\nHelena, and to plants naturally introduced from the adjacent continents.\r\nSurely, if a certain number of African plants reached the island and\r\nbecame modified into a complete adaptation to its climatic conditions,\r\nthey would hardly be expelled by other African plants arriving\r\nsubsequently. They might be so conceivably, but it does not seem\r\nprobable. The cases of the Pampas, New Zealand, Tahiti, etc., are very\r\ndifferent, where highly developed _aggressive_ plants have been\r\nartificially introduced. Under nature it is these very aggressive\r\nspecies that would first reach any island in their vicinity, and, being\r\nadapted to the island and colonising it thoroughly, would then hold\r\ntheir own against other plants from the _same_ country, mostly less\r\naggressive in character. I have not explained this so fully as I should\r\nhave done in the book. Your criticism is therefore useful.\r\n\r\nMy Chap. XXIII. is no doubt very speculative, and I cannot wonder at\r\nyour hesitating at accepting my views. To me, however, your theory of\r\nhosts of existing species migrating over the tropical lowlands from the\r\nNorth Temperate to the South Temperate zone appears more speculative and\r\nmore improbable. For, where could the rich lowland _equatorial_ flora\r\nhave existed during a period of general refrigeration sufficient for\r\nthis? and what became of the wonderfully rich Cape flora which, if the\r\ntemperature of Tropical Africa had been so recently lowered, would\r\ncertainly have spread northwards and on the return of the heat could\r\nhardly have been driven back into the sharply defined and _very\r\nrestricted area_ in which it now exists?\r\n\r\nAs to the migration of plants from mountain to mountain not being so\r\nprobable as to remote islands, I think that is fully counterbalanced by\r\ntwo considerations:\r\n\r\n(a) The area and abundance of the mountain stations along such a range\r\nas the Andes are immensely greater than those of the islands in the\r\nNorth Atlantic, for example.\r\n\r\n(b) The temporary occupation of mountain stations by migrating plants\r\n(which I think I have shown to be probable) renders _time_ a much more\r\nimportant element in increasing the number and variety of the plants so\r\ndispersed than in the case of islands, where the flora soon acquires a\r\nfixed and endemic character, and where the number of species is\r\nnecessarily limited.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, direct evidence of seeds being carried great distances through\r\nthe air is wanted, but, I am afraid, can hardly be obtained. Yet I feel\r\nthe greatest confidence that they _are_ so carried. Take for instance\r\nthe two peculiar orchids of the Azores (Habinaria species): what other\r\nmode of transit is conceivable? The whole subject is one of great\r\ndifficulty, but I hope my chapter may call attention to a hitherto\r\nneglected factor in the distribution of plants.\r\n\r\nYour references to the Mauritius literature are very interesting, and\r\nwill be useful to me; and again thanking you for your valuable remarks,\r\nbelieve me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pen-y-bryn, St. Peter's Road, Croydon. November 21, 1880._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--Many thanks for your new book containing your wonderful\r\nseries of experiments and observations on the movements of plants. I\r\nhave read the introduction and conclusion, which shows me the importance\r\nof the research as indicating the common basis of the infinitely varied\r\nhabits and mode of growth of plants. The whole subject becomes thus much\r\nsimplified, though the nature of the basic vitality which leads to such\r\nwonderful results remains as mysterious as ever.--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pen-y-bryn, St. Peter's Road, Croydon. January 1, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I have been intending to write to you for some weeks to\r\ncall your attention to what seems to me a striking confirmation (or at\r\nall events a support) of my views of the land migration of plants from\r\nmountain to mountain. In _Nature_ of Dec. 9th, p. 126, Mr. Baker, of\r\nKew, describes a number of the alpine plants of Madagascar as being\r\n_identical species_ with some found on the mountains of Abyssinia, the\r\nCameroons, and other African mountains. Now, if there is one thing more\r\nclear than another it is that Madagascar has been separated from Africa\r\nsince the Miocene (probably the early Miocene) epoch. These plants must\r\ntherefore have reached the island either _since_ then, in which case\r\nthey certainly must have passed through the air for long distances, or\r\nat the time of the union. But the Miocene and Eocene periods were\r\ncertainly warm, and these alpine plants could hardly have migrated over\r\ntropical forest lands, while it is very improbable that if they had been\r\nisolated at so remote a period, exposed to such distinct climatal and\r\norganic environments as in Madagascar and Abyssinia, they would have in\r\nboth places retained their specific characters unchanged. The\r\npresumption is, therefore, that they are comparatively _recent_\r\nimmigrants, and if so must have passed across the sea from mountain to\r\nmountain, for the richness and speciality of the Madagascar forest\r\nvegetation render it certain that no recent glacial epoch has seriously\r\naffected that island.\r\n\r\nHoping that you are in good health, and wishing you the compliments of\r\nthe season, I remain yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. January 2, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--The case which you give is a very striking one, and I\r\nhad overlooked it in _Nature._[115] But I remain as great a heretic as\r\never. Any supposition seems to me more probable than that the seeds of\r\nplants should have been blown from the mountains of Abyssinia or other\r\ncentral mountains of Africa to the mountains of Madagascar. It seems to\r\nme almost infinitely more probable that Madagascar extended far to the\r\nsouth during the Glacial period, and that the southern hemisphere was,\r\naccording to Croll, then more temperate; and that the whole of Africa\r\nwas then peopled with some temperate forms, which crossed chiefly by\r\nagency of birds and sea-currents; and some few by the wind from the\r\nshores of Africa to Madagascar, subsequently ascending to the mountains.\r\n\r\nHow lamentable it is that two men should take such widely different\r\nviews, with the same facts before them; but this seems to be almost\r\nregularly our case, and much do I regret it.\r\n\r\nI am fairly well, but always feel half dead with fatigue. I heard but an\r\nindifferent account of your health some time ago, but trust that you are\r\nnow somewhat stronger.--Believe me, my dear Wallace, yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. January 7, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--You know from Miss Buckley that, with her assistance,\r\nI drew up a memorial to Mr. Gladstone with respect to your services to\r\nscience. The memorial was corrected by Huxley, who has aided me in every\r\npossible way. It was signed by twelve good men, and you would have been\r\ngratified if you had seen how strongly they expressed themselves on your\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll, to whom I sent the memorial, wrote a private note to\r\nMr. Gladstone. The memorial was sent in only on January 5th, and I have\r\njust received a note in Mr. Gladstone's own handwriting, in which he\r\nsays: \"I lose no time in apprising you that although the Fund is\r\nmoderate and at present poor, I shall recommend Mr. Wallace for a\r\npension of £200 a year.\" I will keep this note carefully, as, if the\r\npresent Government were to go out, I do not doubt that it would be\r\nbinding on the next Government.\r\n\r\nI hope that it will give you some satisfaction to see that not only\r\nevery scientific man to whom I applied, but that also our Government\r\nappreciated your lifelong scientific labour.--Believe me, my dear\r\nWallace, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI should expect that there will be some delay before you receive an\r\nofficial announcement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pen-y-bryn, St. Peter's Road, Croydon. January 8, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I need not say how very grateful I am to you for your\r\nconstant kindness, and especially for the trouble you have taken in\r\nrecommending me to Mr. Gladstone. It is also, of course, very gratifying\r\nto hear that so many eminent men have so good an opinion of the little\r\nscientific work I have done, for I myself feel it to be very little in\r\ncomparison with that of many others.\r\n\r\nThe amount you say Mr. Gladstone proposes to recommend is considerably\r\nmore than I expected would be given, and it will relieve me from a great\r\ndeal of the anxieties under which I have laboured for several years.\r\nTo-day is my fifty-eighth birthday, and it is a happy omen that your\r\nletter should have arrived this morning.\r\n\r\nI presume after I receive the official communication will be the proper\r\ntime to thank the persons who have signed the memorial in my favour. I\r\ndo not know whether it is the proper etiquette to write a private letter\r\nof thanks to Mr. Gladstone, or only a general official one. Whenever I\r\nhear anything from the Government I will let you know.\r\n\r\nAgain thanking you for your kindness, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. January 10, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I am heartily glad that you are pleased about the\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\nI do not feel that my opinion is worth much on the point which you\r\nmention. A relation who is in a Government office and whose judgment, I\r\nthink, may be fully trusted, felt sure that if you received an official\r\nannouncement without any private note, it ought to be answered\r\nofficially, but if the case were mine, I would express whatever I\r\nthought and felt in an official document. His reason was that Gladstone\r\ngives or recommends the pension on public grounds alone.\r\n\r\nIf the case were mine I would not write to signers of the memorial,\r\nbecause I believe that they acted like so many jurymen in a claim\r\nagainst the Government. Nevertheless, if I met any of them or was\r\nwriting to them on any other subject, I should take the opportunity of\r\nexpressing my feelings. I think you might with propriety write to\r\nHuxley, as he entered so heartily into the scheme and aided in the most\r\nimportant manner in many ways.\r\n\r\nSir J. Lubbock called here yesterday and Mr. F. Balfour came here with\r\none of my sons, and it would have pleased you to see how unfeignedly\r\ndelighted they were at my news of the success of the memorial.\r\n\r\nI wrote also to tell the Duke of Argyll of the success, and he in answer\r\nexpressed very sincere pleasure.--My dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pen-y-bryn, St. Peter's Road, Croydon. January 29, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--Yours just received was very welcome, and the delay in\r\nits reaching me is of no importance whatever, as, having seen the\r\nannouncement of the Queen's approval of the pension, of course I felt it\r\nwas safe. The antedating of the first payment is a very liberal and\r\nthoughtful act; but I do not think it is any way exceptional as regards\r\nmyself. I am informed it is the custom because, as no payment is made\r\nafter the death of the person, if the first payment were delayed the\r\nproposed recipient might die before the half-year (or quarter-day) and\r\nthus receive nothing at all.\r\n\r\nI suppose you sent the right address to Mr. Seymour. I have not yet\r\nheard from him, but I daresay I shall during the next week.\r\n\r\nAs I am assured both by Miss Buckley and by Prof. Huxley that it is to\r\nyou that I owe in the first place this great kindness, and that you have\r\nalso taken an _immense_ amount of trouble to bring it to so successful\r\nissue, I must again return you my best thanks, and assure you that there\r\nis no one living to whose kindness in such a matter I could feel myself\r\nindebted with so much pleasure and satisfaction.--Believe me, dear\r\nDarwin, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. July 9._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--Dr. G. Krefft has sent me the enclosed from Sydney. A\r\nnurseryman saw a caterpillar feeding on a plant and covered the whole\r\nup, but, when he searched for the cocoon [pupa], was long before he\r\ncould find it, so good was its imitation, in colour and form, of the\r\nleaf to which it was attached.\r\n\r\nI hope that the world goes well with you. Do not trouble yourself by\r\nacknowledging this.--Ever yours,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccompanying this letter, which has been published in \"Darwin and Modern\r\nScience\" (1909), was a photograph of the chrysalis (_Papilio sarpedon\r\nchoredon_) attached to a leaf of its food-plant. Many butterfly pupæ\r\nare known to have the power of individual adjustment to the colours of\r\nthe particular food-plant or other normal environment; and it is\r\nprobable that the Australian _Papilio_ referred to by Darwin possesses\r\nthis power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Nutwood Cottage, Frith Hill, Godalming, July 9, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I am just doing, what I have rarely if ever done\r\nbefore--reading a book through a second time immediately after the first\r\nperusal. I do not think I have ever been so attracted by a book, with\r\nperhaps the exception of your \"Origin of Species\" and Spencer's \"First\r\nPrinciples\" and \"Social Statics.\" I wish therefore to call your\r\nattention to it, in case you care about books on social and political\r\nsubjects, but here there is also an elaborate discussion of Malthus's\r\n\"Principles of Population,\" to which both you and I have acknowledged\r\nourselves indebted. The present writer, Mr. George, while admitting the\r\nmain principle as self-evident and as actually operating in the case of\r\nanimals and plants, denies that it ever has operated or can operate in\r\nthe case of man, still less that it has any bearing whatever on the vast\r\nsocial and political questions which have been supported by a reference\r\nto it. He illustrates and supports his views with a wealth of\r\nillustrative facts and a cogency of argument which I have rarely seen\r\nequalled, while his style is equal to that of Buckle, and thus his book\r\nis delightful reading. The title of the book is \"Progress and Poverty.\"\r\nIt has gone through six editions in America, and is now published in\r\nEngland by Kegan Paul. It is devoted mainly to a brilliant discussion\r\nand refutation of some of the most widely accepted maxims of political\r\neconomy, such as the relation of wages and capital, the nature of rent\r\nand interest, the laws of distribution, etc., but all treated as parts\r\nof the main problem as stated in the title-page, \"An Enquiry into the\r\nCause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of\r\nWealth.\" It is the most startling novel and original book of the last\r\ntwenty years, and if I mistake not will in the future rank as making an\r\nadvance in political and social science equal to that made by Adam Smith\r\na century ago.\r\n\r\nI am here settled in my little cottage engaged in the occupation I most\r\nenjoy--making a garden, and admiring the infinite variety and beauty of\r\nvegetable life. I am out of doors all day and hardly read anything. As\r\nthe long evenings come on I shall get on with my book on the \"Land\r\nQuestion,\" in which I have found a powerful ally in Mr. George.\r\n\r\nHoping you are well, believe me, yours most faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is the last letter Wallace received from Darwin, who died\r\non Wednesday, April 19, 1882, in the seventy-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down, Beckenham, Kent. July 12, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have been heartily glad to get your note and hear\r\nsome news of you. I will certainly order \"Progress and Poverty,\" for the\r\nsubject is a most interesting one. But I read many years ago some books\r\non political economy, and they produced a disastrous effect on my mind,\r\nviz. utterly to distrust my own judgment on the subject and to doubt\r\nmuch everyone else's judgment! So I feel pretty sure that Mr. George's\r\nbook will only make my mind worse confounded than it is at present. I,\r\nalso, have just finished a book which has interested me greatly, but\r\nwhether it would interest anyone else I know not: it is \"The Creed of\r\nScience,\" by W. Graham, A.M. Who and what he is I know not, but he\r\ndiscusses many great subjects, such as the existence of God,\r\nimmortality, the moral sense, the progress of society, etc. I think some\r\nof his propositions rest on very uncertain foundations, and I could get\r\nno clear idea of his notions about God. Notwithstanding this and other\r\nblemishes, the book has interested me _extremely_. Perhaps I have been\r\nto some extent deluded, as he manifestly ranks too high what I have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nI am delighted to hear that you spend so much time out of doors and in\r\nyour garden; for with your wonderful power of observation you will see\r\nmuch which no one else has seen. From Newman's old book (I forget the\r\ntitle) about the country near Godalming, it must be charming.\r\n\r\nWe have just returned home after spending five weeks on Ullswater: the\r\nscenery is quite charming; but I cannot walk, and everything tires me,\r\neven seeing scenery, talking with anyone or reading much. What I shall\r\ndo with my few remaining years of life I can hardly tell. I have\r\neverything to make me happy and contented, but life has become very\r\nwearisome to me. I heard lately from Miss Buckley in relation to Lyell's\r\nLife, and she mentioned that you were thinking of Switzerland, which I\r\nshould think and hope you will enjoy much.\r\n\r\nI see that you are going to write on the most difficult political\r\nquestion, the Land. Something ought to be done--but what is to rule? I\r\nhope that you will [not] turn renegade to natural history; but I suppose\r\nthat politics are very tempting.\r\n\r\nWith all good wishes for yourself and family, believe me, my dear\r\nWallace, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWallace's last letter to Darwin was written in October, 1881:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nutwood Cottage, Frith Hill, Godalming. October 18, 1881._\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,--I have delayed writing to thank you for your book on\r\nWorms till I had been able to read it, which I have now done with great\r\npleasure and profit, since it has cleared up many obscure points as to\r\nthe apparent sinking or burying of objects on the surface and the\r\nuniversal covering up of old buildings. I have hitherto looked upon them\r\nchiefly from the gardener's point of view--as a nuisance, but I shall\r\ntolerate their presence in the view of their utility and importance. A\r\nfriend here to whom I am going to lend your book tells me that an\r\nagriculturist who had been in West Australia, near Swan River, told him\r\nmany years ago of the hopelessness of farming there, illustrating the\r\npoverty and dryness of the soil by saying, \"There are no worms in the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nI do not see that you refer to the formation of leaf-mould by the mere\r\ndecay of leaves, etc. In favourable places many inches or even feet of\r\nthis is formed--I presume without the agency of worms. If so, would it\r\nnot take part in the formation of all mould? and also the decay of the\r\nroots of grasses and of all annual plants, or do you suppose that _all_\r\nthese are devoured by worms? In reading the book I have not noticed a\r\nsingle erratum.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of two letters to the _Mark Lane Express_, written\r\nat the request of the editor, and which will show you the direction in\r\nwhich I am now working, and in which I hope to do a little\r\ngood.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

When, as in these\r\ncases, one sex differs much from the other, and varies greatly itself,\r\nit may be that individual variations will occasionally occur, having a\r\ndistant resemblance to groups which are the objects of mimicry, and\r\nwhich it is therefore advantageous to resemble. Such a variety will have\r\na better chance of preservation; the individuals possessing it will be\r\nmultiplied; and their accidental likeness to the favoured group will be\r\nrendered permanent by hereditary transmission, and each successive\r\nvariation which increases the resemblance being preserved, and all\r\nvariation departing from the favoured type having less chance of\r\npreservation, there will in time result those singular cases of two or\r\nmore isolated and fixed forms bound together by that intimate\r\nrelationship which constitutes them the sexes of a single species. The\r\nreason why the females are more subject to this kind of modification\r\nthan the males is probably that their slower flight when laden with\r\neggs, and their exposure to attack while in the act of depositing their\r\neggs upon leaves, render it especially advantageous for them to have\r\nadditional protection. This they at once obtain by acquiring a\r\nresemblance to other species which, from whatever cause, enjoy a\r\ncomparative immunity from persecution.\"\r\n\r\n[55] This no doubt refers to Janet's \"Matérialisme Contemporain.\"\r\n\r\n[56] _Quarterly Journal of Science_, January 7, 1867. \"Ice Marks in\r\nNorth Wales,\" by A.R.

He points out\r\nthat there is no difficulty in believing in the existence of such a moth\r\nas F. Müller had described (_Nature_, 1873, p. 223), a Brazilian\r\nsphinx-moth with a trunk 10 to 11 in. in length. Moreover, Forbes had\r\ngiven evidence to show that such an insect does exist in Madagascar\r\n(_Nature_, 1873, p. 121). The case of _Angræcum_ was put forward by the\r\nDuke of Argyll as being necessarily due to the personal contrivance of\r\nthe Deity. Mr. Wallace shows (p. 476, _Quarterly Journal of Science_,\r\n1867) that both proboscis and nectary might be increased in length by\r\nmeans of Natural Selection. It may be added that Hermann Müller has\r\nshown good grounds for believing that mutual specialisation of this kind\r\nis beneficial both to insect and to plant.\r\n\r\n[63] \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" 1st Edit., ii. 431. \"Did He\r\ncause the frame and mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that a\r\nbreed might be formed of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin\r\ndown the bull for man's brutal sport?\"\r\n\r\n[64] _See_ Wallace, _Quarterly Journ. of Sci._, 1867, pp. 477-8. He\r\nimagined an observer examining a great river system, and finding\r\neverywhere adaptations which reveal the design of the Creator. \"He would\r\nsee special adaptations to the wants of man in the broad, quiet,\r\nnavigable rivers, through fertile alluvial plains, that would support a\r\nlarge population, while the rocky streams and mountain torrents were\r\nconfined to those sterile regions suitable for a small population of\r\nshepherds and herdsmen.\"\r\n\r\n[65] At p. 485 Wallace deals with Fleeming Jenkin's review in the _North\r\nBritish Review_, 1867. The review strives to show that there are strict\r\nlimitations to variation, since the most rigorous and long-continued\r\nselection does not indefinitely increase such a quality as the fleetness\r\nof a racehorse. On this Wallace remarks that the argument \"fails to meet\r\nthe real question,\" which is not whether indefinite change is possible,\r\nbut \"whether such differences as do occur in nature could have been\r\nproduced by the accumulation of variations by selection.\"\r\n\r\n[66] Abstract of a paper on \"Birds' Nests and Plumage,\" read before the\r\nBritish Association.

As I have not seen Dr. Bree's recent\r\nwork, and as his letter is unintelligible to me, I cannot even\r\nconjecture how he has so completely mistaken my meaning; but, perhaps,\r\nno one who has read Mr. Wallace's article, or who has read a work\r\nformerly published by Dr. Bree on the same subject as his recent one,\r\nwill be surprised at any amount of misunderstanding on his\r\npart.--CHARLES DARWIN, Aug. 3.\" _See_ \"Life and Letters of Charles\r\nDarwin,\" iii. 167.\r\n\r\n[92] That is to say, spontaneous generation.

(1808-80).\r\n\r\n[94] \"Expression of the Emotions.\"\r\n\r\n[95] _Quarterly Journal of Science_, January, 1873, p. 116: \"I can\r\nhardly believe that when a cat, lying on a shawl or other soft material,\r\npats or pounds it with its feet, or sometimes sucks a piece of it, it is\r\nthe persistence of the habit of pressing the mammary glands and sucking\r\nduring kittenhood.\" Wallace goes on to say that infantine habits are\r\ngenerally completely lost in adult life, and that it seems unlikely that\r\nthey should persist in a few isolated instances.\r\n\r\n[96] Wallace speaks of \"a readiness to accept the most marvellous\r\nconclusions or interpretations of physiologists on what seem very\r\ninsufficient grounds,\" and he goes on to assert that the frog experiment\r\nis either incorrectly recorded, or else that it \"demonstrates volition,\r\nand not reflex action.\"\r\n\r\n[97] The raising of the hands in surprise is explained (\"Expression of\r\nthe Emotions,\" 1st Edit., p. 287) on the doctrine of antithesis as being\r\nthe opposite of listlessness. Mr. Wallace's view (given in the second\r\nedition of \"Expression of the Emotions,\" p. 300) is that the gesture is\r\nappropriate to sudden defence or to the giving of aid to another person.\r\n\r\n[98] At this time Darwin, while very busy with other work, had to\r\nprepare a second edition of \"The Descent of Man,\" and it is probable\r\nthat he or the publishers suggested that Wallace should make the\r\nnecessary corrections.--EDITOR.\r\n\r\n[99] \"Insectivorous Plants.\"\r\n\r\n[100] \"The Geographical Distribution of Animals.\" 1876.\r\n\r\n[101] Wallace points out that \"hardly a small island on the globe but\r\nhas some land shell peculiar to it,\" and he goes so far as to say that\r\nprobably air-breathing mollusca have been chiefly distributed by air- or\r\nwater-carriage, rather than by voluntary dispersal on the land. _See_\r\n\"More Letters,\" II. 14.\r\n\r\n[102] _See_ \"The Descent of Man,\" 1st Edit., pp. 90 and 143, for\r\ndrawings of the Argus pheasant and its markings.

In Wallace's book, the meaning\r\nof the ocelli comes in by the way, in the explanation of Plate IX., \"A\r\nMalayan Forest with some of its Peculiar Birds.\" The case is a\r\n\"remarkable confirmation of Mr. Darwin's views, that gaily coloured\r\nplumes are developed in the male bird for the purpose of attractive\r\ndisplay.\"\r\n\r\n[103] \"Geographical Distribution of Animals,\" i. 286-7.\r\n\r\n[104] \"Geographical Distribution,\" i. 76.

Blandford, \"On the Age and Correlations of the Plant-bearing\r\nSeries of India and the Former Existence of an Indo-Oceanic Continent\"\r\n(_Quart. Journ. Geol.

(2) There is no sexual\r\ncriminality of Pagan days that might not be defended on the principles\r\nadvocated by the school to which this writer belongs.\" In the _Quarterly\r\nReview_ for October, 1874, p. 587, appeared a letter from Mr. George\r\nDarwin \"absolutely denying\" charge No. 1, and with respect to charge No.\r\n2 he wrote: \"I deny that there is any thought or word in my essay which\r\ncould in any way lend itself to the support of the nameless crimes here\r\nreferred to.\" To the letter was appended a note from Mr. Mivart, in\r\nwhich he said: \"Nothing would have been further from our intention than\r\nto tax Mr. Darwin personally (as he seems to have supposed) with the\r\nadvocacy of laws or acts which he saw to be oppressive or vicious. We,\r\ntherefore, most willingly accept his disclaimer, and are glad to find\r\nthat he does not, in fact, apprehend the full tendency of the doctrines\r\nwhich he has helped to propagate. Nevertheless, we cannot allow that we\r\nhave enunciated a single proposition which is either 'false' or\r\n'groundless.' ... But when a writer, according to his own confession,\r\ncomes before the public 'to attack the institution of marriage' ... he\r\nmust expect searching criticism; and, without implying that Mr. Darwin\r\nhas in 'thought' or 'word' approved of anything which he wishes to\r\ndisclaim, we must still maintain that the doctrines which he advocates\r\nare most dangerous and pernicious.\"--EDITOR.\r\n\r\n[107] The pages refer to Vol. II. of Wallace's \"Geographical\r\nDistribution.\"\r\n\r\n[108] The number (4) was erroneously omitted.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n[109] An error: should have been the Australian.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n[110] Axel Blytt, \"Essay on the Immigration of the Norwegian Flora.\"\r\nChristiania, 1876.\r\n\r\n[111] June 22, 1876, p. 165 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[112] \"The Origin of Species and Genera.\"\r\n\r\n[113] \"Island Life.\"\r\n\r\n[114] In \"My Life\" (ii. 12-13) Wallace writes; \"With this came seven\r\nfoolscap pages of notes, many giving facts from his extensive reading\r\nwhich I had not seen. There were also a good many doubts and suggestions\r\non the very difficult questions in the discussion of the causes of the\r\nglacial epochs. Chapter XXIII., discussing the Arctic element in South\r\nTemperate floras, was the part he most objected to, saying, 'This is\r\nrather too speculative for my old noddle. I must think that you overrate\r\nthe importance of new surfaces on mountains and dispersal from mountain\r\nto mountain. I still believe in alpine plants having lived on the\r\nlowlands and in the southern tropical regions having been cooled during\r\nglacial periods, and thus only can I understand character of floras on\r\nthe isolated African mountains. It appears to me that you are not\r\njustified in arguing from dispersal to oceanic islands to mountains. Not\r\nonly in latter cases currents of sea are absent, but what is there to\r\nmake birds fly direct from one alpine summit to another? There is left\r\nonly storms of wind, and if it is probable or possible that seeds may\r\nthus be carried for great distances, I do not believe that there is at\r\npresent any evidence of their being thus carried more than a few miles.'\r\nThis is the most connected piece of criticism in the notes, and I\r\ntherefore give it verbatim.\"\r\n\r\n[115] \"_Nature_, December 9, 1880.
