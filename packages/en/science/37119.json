As far as has been ascertained, the total number of species\r\nis about 9000 or 10,000. Many of them are microscopic, as the Desmids\r\nand Diatoms, others, as Lessonia, and some of the larger Laminariae\r\n(oarweeds), are arborescent, covering the bed of the sea around the\r\ncoast with a submarine forest; while in the Pacific, off the\r\nnorthwestern shores of America, Nereocystis, a genus allied to\r\nLaminaria, has a stem over 300 feet in length, which, although not\r\nthicker than whipcord, is stout enough to moor a bladder,\r\nbarrel-shaped, six or seven feet long, and crowned with a tuft of\r\nfifty leaves or more, each from thirty to forty feet in length. This\r\nvegetable buoy is a favourite resting place of the sea otter; and\r\nwhere the plant exists in any quantity, the surface of the sea is\r\nrendered impassable to boats. The stem of Macrocystis, which \"girds\r\nthe globe in the southern temperate zone,\" is stated to extend\r\nsometimes to the enormous length of 1500 feet. It is no thicker than\r\nthe finger anywhere, and the upper branches are as slender as\r\npack-thread; but at the base of each leaf there is placed a buoy, in\r\nthe shape of a vesicle filled with air.\r\n\r\nAlthough the worthlessness of Algae has been proverbial, as in the\r\n\"alga inutile\" of Horace and Virgil's \"projecta vilior alga,\" they are\r\nnot without importance in botanical economics. A dozen or more species\r\nfound in the British seas are made use of, raw or prepared in several\r\nways, as food for man. Of these edible Algae, Dr. Harvey considers the\r\ntwo species of Porphyra, or laver, the most valuable. Berkeley says,\r\n\"The best way of preparing this vegetable or condiment, which is\r\nextremely wholesome, is to heat it thoroughly with a little strong\r\ngravy or broth, adding, before it is served on toast, a small quantity\r\nof butter and lemon juice.\" A species of Nostoc is largely consumed in\r\nChina as an ingredient in soup. A similar use is made of Enteromorpha\r\nintestinalis in Japan. Many species of fish and other animals, turtle\r\nincluded, live upon sea-weed. Fucus vesiculosus is a grateful food for\r\ncattle. In Norway, cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs are largely fed\r\nupon it, and on our own coasts cattle eagerly browse on that and\r\nkindred species at low water. In some northern countries, Fucus\r\nserratus sprinkled with meal is used as winter fodder.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 1. Group of Sea-weeds (chiefly Laminariae)]\r\n\r\nAll the marine Algae contain iodine; and even before the value of that\r\nsubstance in glandular complaints had been ascertained, stems of a\r\nsea-weed were chewed as a remedy by the inhabitants of certain\r\ndistricts of South America where goitre is prevalent. Chondrus crispus\r\nand (Gigartina) mamillosa constitute the Irish moss of commerce, which\r\ndissolves into a nutritious and delicate jelly, and the restorative\r\nvalue of which in consumption doubtless depends in some degree on the\r\npresence of iodine. The freshwater Algae not only furnish abundant and\r\nnourishing food to the fish and other animals living in ponds and\r\nstreams, but by their action in the decomposition of carburetted\r\nhydrogen and other noxious gases purify the element in which they\r\nlive, thus becoming important sanitary agents. The value of aquatic\r\nplants in the aquarium is well known. A Chinese species of Gigartina\r\nis much employed as a glue and varnish; and also much used in China in\r\nthe manufacture of lanterns and transparencies, and in that country\r\nand Japan for glazing windows. Handles for table knives and forks,\r\ntools, and other implements have been made from the thick stems of\r\noarweeds, and fishing lines from Chorda filum. Tripoli powder,\r\nextensively used for polishing, consists mainly of the silicious\r\nshells of Diatoms. On various parts of our coast, the coarser species\r\nof sea-weed, now used as a valuable manure, were formerly extensively\r\nburnt for kelp, an impure carbonate of soda. This industry, when\r\ncarried on upon a large scale, became a fruitful source of income to\r\nsome of the poorest districts in the kingdom, bringing, in the last\r\ndecade of last century, nearly L30,000 per annum into Orkney alone.\r\nSince the production of soda from rock salt has become general, kelp\r\nis now only burnt for the extraction of iodine, this being the easiest\r\nway of obtaining that substance.\r\n\r\nAlthough the vegetable structure and mode of reproduction are\r\nessentially the same in all Algae, as regards the former they vary from\r\nthe simple cell, through cells arranged in threads, to a stem and\r\nleaves simulating the vegetation of higher tribes. And although the\r\nsimpler kinds are obviously formed of threads, most of the more\r\ncompound may also be resolved into the same structure by maceration in\r\nhot water or diluted muriatic acid. In substance some are mere masses\r\nof slime or jelly, others are silky to the feel, horny, cartilaginous\r\nor leather-like, and even apparently woody. A few species secrete\r\ncarbonate of lime from the water, laying it up in their tissues;\r\nothers cover themselves completely with that mineral, while some coat\r\nthemselves with silex or flint. Many Algae are beautifully coloured,\r\neven when growing at depths to which very little light penetrates. As\r\nin their vegetative organs, so in their reproductive, Algae exhibit\r\nmany modifications of structure without much real difference. In the\r\ngreen sea-weeds reproduction is effected by simple cell division in\r\nthe unicellular species, and by spores resulting from the union of the\r\ncontents of two cells in the others. The red sea-weeds have a double\r\nsystem of reproduction, a distinctly sexual one, by spores and\r\nantheridia, and another by tetraspores, which by some are considered\r\nto be of the nature of gemmae, or buds. The spores are generally\r\nsituated in distinct hollow conceptacles (favellae, ceramidium,\r\ncoccidium). The tetraspore is also sometimes contained in a\r\nconceptacle. It consists of a more or less globular, transparent cell,\r\nwhich when mature contains within it four (rarely three) sporules.\r\nReproduction in the olive sea-weeds is also double, by zoospores,\r\ngenerally considered gemmae, and by spores and antherozoids, which is a\r\nsexual process.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 2. A, Species of Gleocapsa, one of the\r\n   Palmelleae, in various stages. A becomes B, C, D, and E by\r\n   repeated division. Magnified 300 diameters.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the classification adopted by Professor Harvey, which is\r\nthat generally employed in English systematic manuals, we divide the\r\norder into three sub-orders, named from the prevailing colour of their\r\nspores. 1. Chlorospermeae, with green spores; 2. Rhodospermeae, with red\r\nspores; and 3. Melanospermeae, with olive-coloured spores. The entire\r\nplant in the first group is usually grass-green, but occasionally\r\nolive, purple, blue, and sometimes almost black; in the second it is\r\nsome shade or other of red, very seldom green; and in the third, while\r\ngenerally olive green, it is occasionally brown olive or yellow.\r\n\r\nThe Chlorospermeae are extremely varied in form, often threadlike, and\r\nare propagated either by the simple division of the contents of their\r\ncells (endochrome), by the transformation of particular joints, or by\r\nthe change of the contents of the cells into zoospores, which are\r\ncells moving freely in water by means of hairlike appendages. In their\r\nlower forms they are among the most rudimentary of all plants, and\r\nthus of special interest physiologically, as representing the\r\ncomponent parts of which higher plants are formed. They are subdivided\r\ninto twelve groups, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe first group, Palmelleae, are unicellular plants, the cells of which\r\nare either free or surrounded by a gelatinous mass, and they are\r\npropagated by the division of the endochrome. One of the most\r\nremarkable of the species of this family is Protococcus cruentus,\r\nwhich is found at the foot of walls having a northern aspect, looking\r\nas if blood had been poured out on the ground or on stones.\r\nProtococcus nivalis, again, is the cause of the red snow, of which\r\nearly arctic navigators used to give such marvellous accounts.\r\n(Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 3. A, Fragment of a Filament of Zygnema,\r\n   one of the Conjugateae; B, Closterium; C, Euastrium; two\r\n   desmids.]\r\n\r\nThe Desmideaceae, together with the plants of the next succeeding\r\ngroup, are favourite subjects of investigation or observation by the\r\npossessors of microscopes, an attention they merit from the beauty and\r\nvariety of their forms. They are minute plants of a green colour,\r\nconsisting of cells generally independent of each other, but sometimes\r\nforming brittle threads or minute fronds, and are reproduced by spores\r\ngenerated by the conjugation of two distinct individuals. The process\r\nof conjugation in Desmids and Diatoms consists in the union of the\r\nendochrome of two individuals, each of which in these families is\r\ncomposed of a single cell. This ultimately forms a rounded body or\r\nresting spore, which afterwards germinates, the resulting plant not\r\nhowever acquiring the normal form until the third generation. (Fig.\r\n3.)\r\n\r\nThe Diatomaceae, closely allied to the preceding group in structure and\r\nreproduction, are however distinguished from them by their flinty\r\nshells, which are often beautifully sculptured. Their endochrome is a\r\ngolden brown, instead of green as in the Desmideaceae. The latter,\r\nalso, are confined to fresh water, while the Diatomaceae are found,\r\nthough not exclusively, in the sea, where their shells sometimes,\r\nmicroscopically minute as they are individually, form banks extending\r\nseveral hundred miles. It is stated that in the collection made by Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker in the Himalayas the species closely resemble our own.\r\n\r\nIn the next group, Confervaceae, we are introduced to forms more like\r\nthe general notion of what a plant should be. The individuals of which\r\nit consists are composed of threads, jointed, either simple or\r\nbranched, mostly of a grass-green colour, and propagating either by\r\nminute zoospores or by metamorphosed joints. They are found both in\r\nfresh and salt water, and in damp situations. The number of species is\r\nvery great. A considerable number consist of unbranched threads; the\r\nbranched forms grow sometimes so densely as to assume the form of\r\nsolid balls. After floods, when the water stands for several days,\r\nthey sometimes increase to such an extent, as to form on its\r\nsubsidence a uniform paper-like stratum, which while decomposing is\r\nextremely disagreeable. The name Conferva has been almost discontinued\r\nas a generic title, the majority of British species being now ranged\r\nunder Clado- and Chaeto-phora. The latter are branched, and require\r\ngreat care and attention in order to distinguish them, on account of\r\ntheir general resemblance to each other. Good characters are however\r\nto be found in their mode of branching and the form and comparative\r\nsize of the terminal joints.\r\n\r\nThe Batrachospermeae constitute a small but very beautiful group,\r\nconsisting of gelatinous threads variously woven into a branched\r\ncylindrical frond. The branches are sometimes arranged, as in the\r\nBritish species, so that the plants appear like necklaces. In colour\r\nthey pass from green, through intermediate shades of olive and purple,\r\nto black. In common with some of the higher Algae, the threads of the\r\nsuperficial branches send joints down the stem, changing it from\r\nsimple to compound. The native species are all fluviatile.\r\n\r\nThe Hydrodicteae are among the most remarkable of Algae. Hydrodictyon\r\nutriculatum, the solitary British species, is found in the large pond\r\nat Hampton Court, and in similar situations in various parts of the\r\ncountry, but not very generally. It resembles a green purse or net,\r\nfrom four to six inches in length, with delicate and regular meshes,\r\nthe reticulations being about four lines long. Its method of\r\nreproduction is no less than its form. Each of the cells\r\nforms within itself an enormous mass of small elliptic grains. These\r\nbecome attached by the extremities so as to form a network inside the\r\ncell, and, its walls being dissolved, a new plant is set free to grow\r\nto the size of the parent Hydrodictyon.\r\n\r\nThe Nostochineae grow in fresh water, or attached to moist soil. They\r\nconsist of slender, beaded threads surrounded by a firm jelly, and\r\noften spreading into large, wavy fronds. The larger beads on the\r\ninclosed threads are reproductive spores. (Fig. 4, A.)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 4. A, Fragment of a Filament of Nostoc. B,\r\n   End of a Filament of Oscillatoria.]\r\n\r\nThe Oscillatoreae are another remarkable group, on account of the\r\npeculiar animal-like motions they exhibit. They occur both in salt and\r\nfresh water, and on almost every kind of site in which there is\r\nsufficient moisture. The threads of which they are composed are\r\njointed, and generally unbranched; they are of various tints of blue,\r\nred, and green, and, where their fructification has been ascertained,\r\nare propagated by cell division. The most curious point about them is,\r\nhowever, the movements of their fronds. According to Dr. Harvey, these\r\nare of three kinds--a pendulum-like movement from side to side,\r\nperformed by one end, whilst the other remains fixed, so as to form a\r\npivot; a movement of flexure of the filament itself, the oscillating\r\nextremity bending over from one side to the other, like the head of a\r\nworm or caterpillar seeking something on its line of march; and\r\nlastly, a simple onward movement of progression, the whole phenomenon\r\nbeing, Dr. Harvey thinks, resolvable into a spiral onward movement of\r\nthe filament. Whatever is the cause of this motion, it is not, as used\r\nto be supposed, of an animal nature; for the individuals of this group\r\nare undoubted plants. (Fig. 4, B.) Several species of Rivularia,\r\nbelonging to the Oscillatoreae, are found both in the sea and in fresh\r\nwater. They are gelatinous, and have something of the appearance of\r\nNostoc, in aspect as well as in minute structure.\r\n\r\nThe Conjugatae are freshwater articulated Algae, which reproduce\r\nthemselves by the union of two endochromes. They are very interesting\r\nobjects under the microscope, owing to the spiral or zigzag\r\narrangement of the endochrome of many of them, and the delicacy of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe Bulbochaeteae constitute a small group, some half-a-dozen species\r\nbeing British. They are freshwater plants, composed of articulate\r\nbranched filaments, with fertile bulbshaped branchlets. The endochrome\r\nis believed to be fertilized by bodies developed in antheridia, the\r\ncontents of each fertilized cell dividing into four ovate zoospores.\r\n\r\nThe last two groups of green sea-weeds consist chiefly of marine\r\nplants. Of these the first, Siphoneae, is so called because the plant,\r\nhowever complicated, is composed invariably of a single cell. It\r\npropagates by minute zoospores, by large quiescent spores, or by large\r\nactive spores clothed with cilia. It includes the remarkable genus\r\nCodium, three species of which inhabit the British seas. In Codium\r\nBursa the filamentous frond is spherical and hollow, presenting more\r\nthe appearance of a round sponge or puff-ball than a sea-weed, and is\r\nsomewhat rare. Another species greatly resembles a branched sponge,\r\nand the third forms a velvety crust on the surface of rocks. Another\r\ngenus, Vaucheria, is of a beautiful green colour, forming a velvety\r\nsurface on moist soil, on mud-covered rocks overflowed by the tide, or\r\nparasitic on other sea-weeds. The most attractive plants of this\r\nfamily are however those of the genus Bryopsis, two of which are found\r\non the British shores. The most common one is B. plumosa, the fronds\r\nof which grow usually in the shady and sheltered sides of rock pools.\r\n\r\nThe fronds of the last of the green-weed groups, the Ulvaceae, are\r\nmembranous, and either flat or tubular. Two of them, Ulva latissima,\r\nthe green, and Porphyra laciniata, the purple laver, are among the\r\nmost common sea-weeds, growing well up from low-water mark. The\r\npropagation in all of them is by zoospores. An allied genus,\r\nEnteromorpha, is protean in its forms, which have been classed under\r\nmany species. They may, however, be reduced to half a dozen. Some of\r\nthem are very slender, so as almost to be mistaken for confervoid\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nWith the Rhodospermeae we enter a sub-order of Algae, exclusively\r\nmarine, the plants in which have always held out great attractions to\r\nthe collector. In structure they are expanded or filamentous, nearly\r\nalways rose-coloured or purple in colour. Of the fourteen groups into\r\nwhich they are divided by Harvey, the first is Ceramiaceae, articulate\r\nAlgae, constituting a large proportion of the marine plants of our\r\nshores. Of the genus Ceramium, C. rubrum is the most frequent, and it\r\nis found in every latitude, almost from pole to pole. It is very\r\nvariable in aspect, but can always be recognized by its fruit. C.\r\ndiaphanum is a very handsome species, growing often in rock pools\r\nalong with the other. There are about fifteen native species\r\naltogether, some of them rare, and all very beautiful, both as\r\ndisplayed on paper and seen under the microscope. Crouania attenuata\r\nis a beautiful plant, parasitic upon a Cladostephus or Corallina\r\nofficinalis. It is however extremely rare, being only found in England\r\nabout Land's End. A more common and conspicuous, but equally handsome\r\nplant is Ptilota plumosa (Fig. 9), which is mostly confined to our\r\nnorthern coasts; although P. sericea, a smaller species, or variety,\r\nis common in the south, and easily distinguished from its congener,\r\nwhich it otherwise greatly resembles, by its jointed branchlets and\r\npinnules. Callithamnion, Halurus and Griffithsia, articulate like\r\nCeramium, furnish also several handsome species. (Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 5. Species of Callithamnion.]\r\n\r\nThe group Spyridiaceae contains only one English plant, Spyridia\r\nfilamentosa, which is curiously and irregularly branched, the branches\r\nbeing articulate and of a pinky red. One of its kinds of fruit,\r\nconsisting of crimson spores, is contained in a transparent network\r\nbasket, formed by the favellae, or short branches, whence its name.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 6. Chondrus crispus.]\r\n\r\nThe Cryptonemiaceae are very numerous in genera and species. They all\r\nhave inarticulate branches, some are thread-like. Grateloupia filicina\r\nis a neat little plant, met with rarely on the south and west coasts.\r\nGigartina mamillosa, a common plant everywhere, is the plant sold,\r\nalong with Chondrus crispus, as Irish or Carrageen moss. A handsome\r\nlittle plant, Stenogramme interrupta, is very rare, but it has been\r\ngathered both on the Irish and English coasts. The Phyllophorae, one\r\nspecies of which is frequent on all our shores, may be recognised by\r\nthe way in which the points and surfaces of their fronds throw out\r\nproliferous leaves. Gymnogongrus has two British species, one much\r\nresembling Chondrus crispus, already named, of which it was formerly\r\nconsidered a congener. Their fructification is however very different.\r\nAhnfeltia plicata is a curiouswiry, entangled plant, almost black in\r\ncolour, and like horse-hair when dry, and can scarcely be mistaken.\r\nCystoclonium purpurascens is very commonly cast up by the tide on most\r\nof our coasts. It varies in colour, but is easily distinguished by the\r\nspore-bearing tubercles imbedded in its slender branches. Callophyllis\r\nlaciniata is a handsome species, of a rich crimson colour, and\r\nsometimes a foot square. It can scarcely have escaped the notice of\r\nthe sea-side visitor, for it is widely distributed and often thrown\r\nout in great abundance; one writer describes the shore near Tynemouth\r\nas having been red for upwards of a mile with this superb sea-weed.\r\nKalymenia reniformis is another of the broad, flat Algae, but it is\r\nscarcer, and of a colour not so conspicuous. Among the most frequent\r\nof our sea-weeds, both as growing in the rock pools and cast ashore,\r\nis Chondrus crispus, already twice referred to in connexion with its\r\nofficinal uses. It is very variable in form, one author figuring as\r\nmany as thirty-six different varieties. (Fig. 6.) Chylocladia\r\nclavellosa, which is sometimes cast ashore a foot and a half long, is\r\nclosely set with branches, and these again clothed with branchlets in\r\none or two series. The whole plant is fleshy, of a rose-red or\r\nbrilliant pink colour, turning to golden yellow in decay. There is\r\nanother small species, confined to the extreme north of Britain.\r\nHalymenia ligulata is another flat red weed, but sometimes very narrow\r\nin its ramifications. Furcellaria fastigiata has a round, branched,\r\ntaper stem, swollen at the summit, which contains the fruit,\r\nconsisting of masses of tetraspores in a pod-like receptacle.\r\nSchizymenia edulis, better known perhaps by its old name Iridea, is a\r\nflat, inversely egg-shaped leaf with scarcely any stem. It is one of\r\nthe edible Algae, and pretty frequent in shady rock pools.\r\nGloiosiphonia capillaris is a remarkably beautiful plant, and not\r\ncommon, being confined to certain parts of the southern coasts. The\r\nstem is very soft and gelatinous; the spores are produced in red\r\nglobular masses imbedded in the marginal filaments, which have a fine\r\nappearance under the microscope when fresh.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 7. Rhodomenia palmata.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 8. Wormskioldia sanguinea.]\r\n\r\nThe Rhodomeniaceae are purplish or blood-red sea-weeds, inarticulate,\r\nmembranaceous, and cellular. Among the dark-coloured is Rhodomenia\r\npalmata, better known as dulse, a common and edible species. (Fig. 7.)\r\nWormskioldia sanguinea is not only the most beautiful sea-weed, but\r\nthe finest of all leaves or fronds. It is usually about six inches\r\nlong, but sometimes nearly double that length and six inches broad,\r\nwith a distinct midrib and branching veins, and a delicate wavy\r\nlamina, pink or deep red. The fruit is produced in winter from small\r\nleaflets growing upon the bare midrib. (Fig. 8.) The commonest of all\r\nred sea-weeds on our coast, one of the most elegant, and much sought\r\nafter by sea-weed picture makers, Plocamium coccineum, belongs to this\r\ngroup. Calliblepharis ciliata and jubata are coarser plants, the\r\nlatter being the more frequent. They were formerly included in the\r\ngenus Rhodymenia, from which they were removed when their fruit was\r\nbetter understood.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 9. Ptilota plumosa.]\r\n\r\nWrangelia and Naccaria are the only British genera in Wrangeliaceae.\r\nThere is only one native species in each, both being rare, the latter\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\nThe Helminthocladiae are also a limited group, of a gelatinous\r\nstructure; so much so that on being gathered they feel like a bunch of\r\nslimy worms, whence the name of the family. Helminthora purpurea and\r\ndivaricata with Nemaleon multifidum and Scinaia furcellata represent\r\nthem in Britain. They are nearly all very rare, pretty plants, and\r\nvery effective as microscopic objects.\r\n\r\nThe Squamariae, formerly included in the Corallinaceae, are a small\r\ngroup of inconspicuous plants resembling lichens, of a leathery\r\ntexture, and growing on rocks and shells attached by their lower\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nA single genus only, Polyides, represents the Spongiocarpeae. Polyides\r\nrotundus resembles Furcellaria fastigiata very closely, but differs\r\nwidely in the fruit, which consists of spongy warts surrounding the\r\nfrond, composed of spores and articulated threads.\r\n\r\nOf the next group represented in Britain, Gelidiaceae, we have only one\r\nplant, Gelidium corneum, very common on our shores, and perhaps the\r\nmost variable of all vegetable species.\r\n\r\nThe Sphaerococcidae include both membranaceous and cartilaginous\r\nspecies. Of the latter is Sphaerococcus coronopifolius, which cannot\r\neasily be mistaken, owing to the numerous berry-like fruits that tip\r\nits branchlets. It is rather rare on the northern, but often thrown\r\nashore in large quantities on the southern coasts. The genus\r\nDelesseria has four British species, the largest being the well-known\r\nD. sinuosa, the fronds of which resemble an oak leaf in outline. The\r\nhandsomest are D. ruscifolia and D. hypoglossum, which are more\r\ndelicate and of a finer colour than sinuosa. There are three British\r\nspecies of Gracillaria, in two of which the branches are cylindrical,\r\nand in the other flat. G. compressa makes an excellent preserve and\r\npickle, but unfortunately it is the rarest of the three. Nitophyllum\r\nis one of the greatest ornaments of this tribe. There are six British\r\nspecies, which are amongst the most delicate and beautiful of our\r\nnative Algae.\r\n\r\nThe Corallinaceae are remarkable for the property they possess of\r\nabsorbing carbonate of lime into their tissues, so that they appear as\r\na succession of chalky articulations or incrustations. The most common\r\nis Corallina officinalis. There are two British species of Corallina,\r\nand two also of the nearly allied genus, Jania. Of the foliaceous\r\ngroup there are likewise two British genera, Melobesia and\r\nHildenbrantia.\r\n\r\nThe next group, the Laurenciaceae, are cartilaginous and cylindrical or\r\ncompressed, the frond in the greater portion of them being\r\ninarticulate and solid. They contain several species valued by\r\ncollectors, although some of them are amongst our commonest plants.\r\nTheir colour is, when perfect, a dull purple or brownish red, but they\r\nchange under the influence of light and air, while fresh water is\r\nrapidly destructive to their tints. (Fig. 10.)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 10. Laurencia pinnatifida.]\r\n\r\nThe Chylocladiae are curiously jointed plants, removed by Agardh to a\r\nnew genus, Lomentaria, and a new order Chondriae. Bonnemaisonia\r\nasparagoides is the most rare and beautiful of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe last tribe of red weeds, Rhodomelaceae, varies greatly in the\r\nstructure of the frond, but the fruit is more uniform. Polysiphonia\r\nand Dasya contain the finest of the filiform division; the leafy one,\r\nOdonthalia, a northern form, is a very beautiful sea-weed both as\r\nrespects form and colour. Well-grown specimens are not unlike a\r\nhawthorn twig, and of a blood red colour.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the sub-order Melanospermeae, are, like the red\r\nsea-weeds, exclusively marine. They are usually large and coarse, and\r\nconfined mostly to comparatively shallow water. In the Laminariaceae we\r\nfind the gigantic oarweeds already briefly referred to. Lessonia,\r\nwhich encircles in submarine forests the antarctic coasts, is an\r\nerect, tree-like plant, with a trunk from five to ten feet high,\r\nforked branches, and drooping leaves, one to three feet in length, and\r\nhas been compared to a weeping willow. Sir Joseph Hooker says, that\r\nfrom a boat there may on a calm day be witnessed in the antarctic\r\nregions, over these submarine groves, \"as busy a scene as is presented\r\nby the coral reefs of the tropics. The leaves of the Lessoniae are\r\ncrowded with Sertulariae and Mollusca, or encircled with Flustra; on\r\nthe trunks parasitic Algae abound, together with chitons, limpets, and\r\nother shells; at the base and among the tangled roots swarm thousands\r\nof Crustaceae and Radiata, while fish of several species dart among the\r\nleaves and branches.\" Of these and other gigantic melanosperms, flung\r\nashore by the waves, a belt of decaying vegetable matter is formed,\r\nmiles in extent, some yards broad, and three feet in depth; and Sir J.\r\nHooker adds that the trunks of Lessonia so much resemble driftwood\r\nthat no persuasion could prevent an ignorant shipmaster from employing\r\nhis crew, during two bitterly cold days, in collecting this\r\nincombustible material for fuel. Macrocystis and Nereocystis are also\r\ngiant members of this sub-order. Some of the Laminariae which form a\r\nbelt around our own coasts not seldom attain a length of from eight to\r\ntwelve feet. The common bladder-wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) sometimes\r\ngrows in Jutland to a height of ten feet, and in clusters several feet\r\nin diameter. The colour of most of the plants in this sub-order is\r\nsome shade of olive, but several of them turn to green in drying.\r\n\r\nThe first group, Ectocarpeae, is composed of thread-like jointed\r\nplants, the fructification of which consists of external spores,\r\nsometimes formed by the swelling of a branchlet. The typical genus,\r\nEctocarpus, abounds in species, a dozen or so of which, very nearly\r\nallied plants, being found around our own shores. One or two of them\r\nare very handsome. There are also some very beautiful plants in the\r\ngenus Sphacelaria, belonging to this group, several of them resembling\r\nminiature ferns. All the Sphacelariae are easily recognized by the\r\nwithered appearance of the tips of the fruiting branches. Myriotrichia\r\nis a genus of small parasitical plants, the two British species of\r\nwhich grow chiefly on the sea thongs (Chorda).\r\n\r\nThe Chordariae are sometimes gelatinous in structure, in other cases\r\ncartilaginous. The fruit is contained in the substance of the frond.\r\nThe genus Chordaria consists of plants which have the appearance of\r\ndark coloured twine. There are two British species, one being rather\r\ncommon. Chorda filum, sea-rope, another string-like sea-weed, grows in\r\ntufts from a few inches to many feet in length, and tapering at the\r\nroots to about the thickness of a pig's bristle. In quiet land-locked\r\nbays with a sandy or muddy bottom, it sometimes extends to forty feet\r\nin length, forming extensive meadows, obstructing the passage of\r\nboats, and endangering the lives of swimmers entangled in its slimy\r\ncords, whence probably its other name of \"dead men's lines.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 11. Padina pavonia.]\r\n\r\nThe Mesogloieae in a fresh state resemble bundles of green, slimy\r\nworms. There are three British species, two of which are not uncommon.\r\nAlthough so unattractive in external aspect, they, like many others of\r\nthe same description, prove very interesting under the microscope. One\r\nof the cartilaginous species, Leathsia tuberiformis, has the\r\nappearance, when growing, of a mass of distorted tubers.\r\n\r\nThe species of Elachista, composed of minute parasites, are, as well\r\nas unattractive like the Mesogloieae, inconspicuous, but are beautiful\r\nobjects when placed under the microscope. Myrionemae are also\r\nparasitic, and even smaller than the plants of the preceding genus.\r\n\r\nIn the Dictyoteae the frond is mostly flat, with a reticulated surface,\r\nwhich is sprinkled when in fruit with groups of naked spores or spore\r\ncysts. This tribe includes not a few of the most elegant among the\r\nAlgae. In structure they are coriaceous, and include plants both with\r\nbroad and narrow, branched and unbranched fronds. In Haliseris there\r\nis a distinct midrib. The largest of the British Dictyoteae is Cutleria\r\nmultifida, sometimes found a foot and a half long; and the best known\r\nis doubtless Padina pavonia, much sought after by seaside visitors\r\nwhere it grows. Its segments are fan-shaped, variegated with lighter\r\ncurved lines, and fringed with golden tinted filaments. (Fig. 11.)\r\nOwing to its power of decomposing light, its fronds, when growing\r\nunder water, suggest the train of the peacock, whence its specific\r\nname. Taonia atomaria somewhat resembles Cutleria, but exhibits also\r\nthe wavy lines of Padina. The plant of this group most often cast\r\nashore is Dictyota dichotoma. It makes a handsome specimen when well\r\ndried, and is interesting on account of the manner in which it varies\r\nin the breadth of its divisions. The variety intricata is curiously\r\ncurled and entangled. Dictyosiphon foeniculaceus, the solitary\r\nBritish example of its genus, is a bushy filiform plant, remarkable\r\nfor the beautiful net-like markings of its surface. The Punctariae have\r\nflattened fronds, marked with dots, which sufficiently distinguish\r\nthem from all the others. A small form is often found parasitic on\r\nChorda filum, spreading out horizontally like the hairs of a bottle\r\nbrush. Asperococcus derives its name from its roughened surface,\r\noccasioned by the thickly scattered spots of fructification.\r\n\r\nThe Laminariaceae are inarticulate, mostly flat, often strap-shaped.\r\nTheir spores occur in superficial patches, or covering the whole\r\nfrond. The plants of this order, as we have already seen, include the\r\ngiants of submarine vegetation. In point of mass they constitute the\r\nlarger part of our native Algae, although they number only a few\r\nspecies. They are popularly known as tangle or oarweeds, and the stems\r\nof Laminaria saccharina and the midrib of Alaria esculenta are used as\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe Sporochnaceae are a small but beautiful tribe, inarticulate, and\r\nproducing their spores in jointed filaments or knob-like masses, and\r\nremarkable for their property of turning from olive brown to a\r\nverdigris green when exposed to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 12. Fucus serratus, showing a transverse\r\n   section of the Conceptacle, and Antheridium with Antherozoids\r\n   escaping.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are deep sea plants, or at least grow about low water mark. The\r\nlargest of the group is Desmarestia ligulata, which, with the other\r\nBritish species, D. aculeata, is often cast ashore. The latter\r\nspecies, at an early period of its existence, is clothed with tufts of\r\nslender hairs, springing from the margin of the frond. Desmarestia\r\nviridis is the most delicate and also the rarest of the three. Nothing\r\nlike fruit has been discovered on any of them. Arthocladia villosa and\r\nSporochnus pedunculatus are branched sea-weeds, covered also with\r\ntufts of closely set hairs. Carpomitra Cabrerae, a rare species, bears,\r\nin common with the two preceding species, its spores in a special\r\nreceptacle. In the first the receptacle is pod-like; in the second\r\nknotted; and in the last mitriform.\r\n\r\nThe concluding group of Algae is the Fucaceae, including the universally\r\nknown sea wrack (Fucus). The frond in all of them is jointless. They\r\nare reproduced by means of antheridia and oogonia developed in\r\nconceptacles, clustered together at the apex of the branches. Both\r\nfrom their bulk and their decided sexual distinctions, they deserve to\r\nrank at the head of the order. Of all sea-weeds they are also perhaps\r\nof the greatest use to man. One of the most interesting among them is\r\nthe Gulfweed (Sargassum bacciferum), occupying a tract of the Atlantic\r\nextending over many degrees of latitude. Pieces of it, and of its\r\ncongener, S. vulgare, are occasionally drifted to our shores, and they\r\nconsequently find a place in works on British Algae, although they have\r\nno claim to be considered native plants. On rocky coasts the various\r\nspecies of Fucus occupy the greater part of the space between\r\ntide-marks, the most plentiful being Fucus vesiculosus. F. serratus\r\n(Fig. 12) is the handsomest of the genus, the other species being F.\r\nnodosus, said to be the most useful for making kelp, and F.\r\ncanaliculatus. Halidrys siliquosa is remarkable for its spore\r\nreceptacles, which have quite the appearance of the seed vessel of a\r\nflowering plant. The species of Cystoseira, chiefly confined to the\r\nsouthern coasts, are also very interesting. Their submerged fronds are\r\nbeautifully iridescent, and the stems, of the largest species at\r\nleast, are generally covered with a great variety of parasites, animal\r\nand vegetable, the former consisting of Hydrozoa and Polyzoa, and\r\nother curious forms. Himanthalia lorea is another remarkable plant. It\r\nhas conspicuous forked fruit-bearing receptacles; but the real plants\r\nare the small cones at the base of these, and from which they are shed\r\nwhen ripe.\r\n\r\nAs to conditions of site and geographical distribution, Algae do not\r\ndiffer from land plants. Latitude, depth of water, and currents\r\ninfluence them in the same way as latitude, elevation, and station\r\noperate on the latter; and the analogy is maintained in the almost\r\ncosmopolitan range of some, and the restricted habitat of others. Not\r\nmany extra-European species of Desmids are known, but those of Diatoms\r\nare far more widely diffused, and extend beyond the limits of all\r\nother vegetation, existing wherever there is water sufficient to allow\r\nof their production; and they are found not only in water, but also\r\non the moist surface of the ground and on other plants, in hot springs\r\nand amid polar ice. They are said to occur in such countless myriads\r\nin the South Polar Sea as to stain the berg and pack ice wherever\r\nthese are washed by the surge. A deposit of mud, chiefly consisting of\r\nthe shells of Diatoms, 400 miles long, 120 miles broad, and of unknown\r\nthickness, was found at a depth of between 200 and 400 feet on the\r\nflanks of Victoria Land in 70 deg. south latitude. Such is their abundance\r\nin some rivers and estuaries that Professor Ehrenberg goes the length\r\nof affirming that they have exercised an important influence in\r\nblocking up harbours and diminishing the depth of channels. The trade\r\nand other winds distribute large quantities over the earth, which may\r\naccount for the universality of their specific distribution; for Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker found the Himalayan species to closely resemble our own.\r\nCommon British species also occur in Ceylon, Italy, Virginia, and\r\nPeru. The typical species of the Confervaceae are also distributed over\r\nthe whole surface of the globe. They inhabit both fresh and salt\r\nwater, and are found alike in the polar seas and in the boiling\r\nsprings of Iceland, in mineral waters and in chemical solutions. Some\r\nof the tropical ones are exceedingly large and dense. Batrachospermum\r\nvagum, in the next tribe, a native of England, is also found in New\r\nZealand. An edible species of Nostochineae, produced on the boggy\r\nslopes bordering the Arctic Ocean, is blown about by the winds\r\nsometimes ten miles from land, where it is found lying in small\r\ndepressions in the snow upon the ice. The common Nostoc of moist\r\nground in England occurs also in Kerguelen's Land, high in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. Floating masses of Monormia are often the cause\r\nof the green hue assumed by the water of ponds and lakes. Certain\r\nspecies of Oscillatoria of a deep red colour live in hot springs in\r\nIndia, and the Red Sea is supposed to have derived its name from a\r\nspecies of this tribe, which covers it with a scum for many miles,\r\naccording to the direction of the wind. The lake of Glaslough in\r\nCounty Monaghan, Ireland, owes its colour and its name to Oscillatoria\r\naerugescens, and large masses of water in Scotland and Switzerland are\r\ntinted green or purple by a similar agency. A few species of Siphoneae\r\nhave a very wide range, two British species of Codium occurring in New\r\nZealand. The Ulvaceae abound principally in the colder latitudes.\r\nEnteromorpha intestinalis, a common British species, is as frequent in\r\nJapan, where it is used, when dried, in soup. The Rhodosperms are\r\nfound in every sea, although the geographical boundaries of genera are\r\noften well-marked. Gloiosiphonia, one of our rarest and most\r\nbeautiful Algae, is widely diffused. Of Melanosperms the Laminariae\r\naffect the higher northern latitudes, Sargassa abound in the warmer\r\nseas, while Durvillaea, Lessonia, and Macrocystis characterize the\r\nmarine flora of the Southern Ocean. The Fucaceae are most abundant\r\ntowards the poles, where they attain their greatest size. The marine\r\nmeadows of Sargassum, conceived by some naturalists to mark the site\r\nof the lost Atlantis, and which give its name to the Sargasso Sea,\r\nextending between 20 deg. and 25 deg. north latitude, in 40 deg. west longitude,\r\noccupy now the same position as when the early navigators, with\r\nconsiderable trepidation, forced through their masses on the way to\r\nthe New World. Sargassum is drifted into this tract of ocean by\r\ncurrents, the plants being all detached; and they do not produce fruit\r\nin that state, being propagated by buds, which originate new branches\r\nand leaves. (Fig. 13.)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 13. The Gulf-weed (Sargassum bacciforum).]\r\n\r\nOwing to their soft, cellular structure, Algae are not likely to be\r\npreserved in a fossil state; but what have been considered such have\r\nbeen found as low down as the Silurian formation, although their\r\nidentity has been disputed, and several of them, it is more than\r\nprobable, belong to other orders, and some even to the animal kingdom.\r\nFreshwater forms, all of existing genera and species, are believed to\r\nhave been detected in the carboniferous rocks of Britain and France;\r\nothers also of the green-coloured division are said to occur from the\r\nSilurian to the Eocene, and the Florideae to be represented from the\r\nLias to the Miocene. The indestructible nature of the shells of the\r\nDiatomaceae has enabled them to survive where the less protected\r\nspecies may have perished. Tripoli stone, a Tertiary rock, is entirely\r\ncomposed of the remains of microscopic plants of this tribe. It is\r\nfrom their silicious shells that mineral acquires its use in the arts,\r\nas powder for polishing stones and metals. Ehrenberg estimates that in\r\nevery cubic inch of the tripoli of Bilin, in Bohemia, there are\r\n41,000,000 of Gaillonella distans. Districts recovered from the sea\r\nfrequently contain myriads of Diatoms, forming strata of considerable\r\nthickness; and similar deposits occur in the ancient sites of lakes in\r\nthis and other countries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore setting out in search of Algae the collector ought to provide\r\nhimself with a pair of stout boots to guard his feet from the\r\nsharp-pointed rocks, as well as a staff or pole to balance himself in\r\nrock-climbing, which ought to have a hook for drawing floating weed\r\nashore. A stout table-knife tied to the other end will be found very\r\nuseful. A basket--a fishing-basket does very well--or a waterproof\r\nbag, for stowing away his plants, is also necessary. It is advisable\r\nto carry a few bottles for the very small and delicate plants, and\r\ncare should be taken to keep apart, and in sea-water, any specimens of\r\nthe Sporochnaceae; for they are not only apt to decay themselves but to\r\nbecome a cause of corruption in the other weeds with which they come\r\nin contact. These bottles should always be carried in the bag or\r\npocket, never in the hand.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds, as every visitor to the coast knows, are torn up in great\r\nnumbers by the waves, especially during storms, and afterwards left on\r\nthe shore by the retiring tide. Many shallow-growing species are also\r\nto be found attached to the rocks, and in the rock pools, between high\r\nand low water mark. There are three points on the beach where the\r\ngreatest accumulations of floating Algae are found: high water mark,\r\nmid-tide level, and low water mark. Low water occurs about five or\r\nfive and a half hours after high water. The best time for the\r\ncollector to commence is half an hour or so before dead low water. He\r\ncan then work to the lowest point safely, and, retiring before the\r\napproaching tide, examine the higher part of the beach up to high\r\nwater mark. If the coarse weeds in the rock pools and chinks are\r\nturned back, many rare and delicate Algae will be found growing under\r\nthem, especially at the lowest level. The most effective method of\r\ncollecting the plants of deeper water is by dredging, or going round\r\nwith a boat at the extreme ebb, and taking them from the rocks and\r\nfrom the Laminaria stems, on which a great number have their station.\r\nStems of Laminaria thrown out by the waves should also be carefully\r\nexamined. In all cases the weed should be well rinsed in a clear rock\r\npool before being put away in the bag or other receptacle.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be considered is the laying out and preserving of\r\nthe specimens selected for the herbarium. Wherever possible these\r\nshould be laid out on paper, and put under pressure as soon as\r\ngathered, or on the same day at all events. When this is\r\nimpracticable, they may be spread between the folds of soft and thick\r\ntowels and rolled up. Thus treated the most delicate plants will keep\r\nfresh until next day. Another way is to pack the plants in layers of\r\nsalt, like herrings; but the most usual method of roughly preserving\r\nsea-weeds collected during an unprepared visit to the shore is by\r\nmoderately drying them in an airy room out of the direct rays of the\r\nsun. They are then to be placed lightly in bags, and afterwards\r\nrelaxed by immersion and prepared in the usual way. The finer plants,\r\nhowever, suffer more or less by this delay. If carried directly home\r\nfrom the sea the plants should be emptied into a vessel of sea-water.\r\nA flat dish, about fourteen inches square and three deep, is then to\r\nbe filled with clean water. For most plants this may be fresh, for\r\nsome it is essential that it should be salt. Some of the Polysiphonias\r\nand others begin to decompose at once if placed in fresh water. The\r\nGriffithsias burst and let out their colouring matter, and a good many\r\nchange their colour. The appliances required are some fine white\r\npaper--good printing demy, thirty-six pounds or so in weight per ream,\r\ndoes very well,--an ample supply of smooth blotting paper, the coarse\r\npaper used by grocers and called \"sugar royal,\" or, best of all,\r\nBentall's botanical drying paper, pieces of well-washed book muslin, a\r\ncamel's hair brush, a bodkin for assisting to spread out the plants, a\r\npair of scissors, and a pair of forceps. The mounting paper may be cut\r\nin three sizes: 5 in. by 4 in., 71/2 in. by 51/4 in., and 10 in. by\r\n71/2 in. Then having selected a specimen, place it in the flat dish\r\nreferred to above, and prune it if necessary. Next take a piece of\r\nthe mounting paper of suitable size, and slip it into the water\r\nunderneath the plant, keeping hold of it with the thumb of the left\r\nhand. Having arranged the plant in a natural manner on the paper,\r\nbrush it gently with the camel's hair brush to remove any dirt or\r\nfragments, draw out paper and plant gently and carefully in an oblique\r\ndirection, and set them on end for a short time to drain. Having in\r\nthis way transferred as many specimens as will cover a sheet of drying\r\npaper, lay them upon it neatly side by side, and cover them with a\r\npiece of old muslin. Four sheets of drying paper are then to be placed\r\nupon this, then another layer of plants and muslin and four more\r\nsheets of drying paper, until a heap, it may be six or eight inches\r\nthick, is built up. Place this between two flat boards, weighted with\r\nstones, bricks, or other weights; but the pressure should be moderate\r\nat first, otherwise the texture of the muslin may be stamped on both\r\npaper and plant. The papers must be changed in about three hours'\r\ntime, and afterwards every twelve hours. In three or four days,\r\naccording to the state of the weather, the muslin may be removed, the\r\nplants again transferred to dry paper, and subjected to rather severe\r\npressure for several days.\r\n\r\nThe very gelatinous plants require particular treatment. One way is to\r\nput them in drying paper and under a board but to apply no other\r\npressure, change the drying paper at least twice during the first half\r\nhour, and after the second change of dryers apply very gentle\r\npressure, increasing it until the specimens are fully dry. A safer and\r\nless troublesome way, for the efficacy of which we can vouch, is to\r\nlay down the plants and dry them without any pressure, afterwards\r\ndamping the back of the mounting papers and placing them in the drying\r\npress. Some Algae will scarcely adhere to paper. These should be\r\npressed until tolerably dry, then be immersed in skim-milk for a\r\nquarter of an hour, and pressed and dried as before. A slight\r\napplication of isinglass, dissolved in alcohol, to the under side of\r\nthe specimen is sometimes necessary. Before mounting, or at all events\r\nbefore transference to the herbarium, care should be taken to write in\r\npencil on the back of the paper the name of the plant, if known, the\r\nplace where gathered, and the date. The coarse olive weeds, such as\r\nthe bladder-wrack, Halidrys, and the like, may in the case of a short\r\nvisit to the coast be allowed to dry in an airy place, and taken home\r\nin the rough. Before pressing, in any case, they should be steeped in\r\nboiling water for about half an hour to extract the salt, then washed\r\nin clean fresh water, dried between coarse towels, and pressed and\r\ndried in the same way as flowering plants. A collection of Algae may be\r\nfastened on sheets of paper of the usual herbarium size and kept in a\r\ncabinet or portfolios, or attached to the leaves of an album. For\r\nscientific purposes, however, the latter is the least convenient way.\r\n\r\nThere are few objects more beautiful than many of the sea-weeds when\r\nwell preserved; but the filiform species, especially those of the\r\nfirst sub-order, do not retain their distinguishing characters when\r\npressed as has been described. Portions of these, however, as well as\r\nsections of stems and fruit, may be usefully dried on small squares of\r\nthin mica, for subsequent microscopic examination, or they may be\r\nmounted on the ordinary microscope slides. This is the only course\r\npossible with Desmids and Diatoms. The former are to be sought in\r\nshallow pools, especially in open boggy moors. The larger species\r\ncommonly lie in a thin gelatinous stratum at the bottom of the pools,\r\nand by gently passing the fingers under them they will be caused to\r\nrise towards the surface, when they can be lifted with a scoop. Other\r\nspecies form a greenish or dirty cloud on the stems and leaves of\r\nother aquatic plants, and by stripping the plant between the fingers\r\nthese also may be similarly detached and secured. If they are much\r\ndiffused through the water, they may be separated by straining through\r\nlinen; and this is a very common way of procuring them. Living Diatoms\r\nare found on aquatic plants, on rocks and stones, under water or on\r\nmud, presenting themselves as coloured fringes, cushion-like tufts, or\r\nfilmy strata. In colour the masses vary from a yellowish brown to\r\nalmost black. They are difficult, both when living and dead, to\r\nseparate from foreign matter; but repeated washings are effectual in\r\nboth cases, and, for the living ones, their tendency to move towards\r\nthe light may also be taken advantage of. When only the shells are\r\nwanted for mounting, the cell contents are removed by means of\r\nhydrochloric and nitric acid. The most satisfactory medium for\r\npreserving fresh Desmids and Diatoms is distilled water, and if the\r\nwater is saturated with camphor, or has dissolved in it a grain of\r\nalum and a grain of bay salt to an ounce of water, confervoid growths\r\nwill be prevented. For larger preparations of Algae, Thwaites' fluid is\r\nstrongly recommended. This is made by adding to one part of rectified\r\nspirit as many drops of creasote as will saturate it, and then\r\ngradually mixing with it in a pestle and mortar some prepared chalk,\r\nwith sixteen parts of water; an equal quantity of water saturated with\r\ncamphor is then to be added, and the mixture, after standing for a\r\nfew days, to be carefully filtered.\r\n\r\nFor authorities on the morphology and classification of the Algae,\r\nstudents may be referred to Sachs' \"Text Book\" and Le Maout's \"System\r\nof Botany,\" of which there are good translations, and the\r\n\"Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany,\" by the Rev. M. J. Berkeley; for\r\ndescriptions and the identification of species, to the text and\r\nfigures of Harvey's \"Phycologia Britannica,\" and \"Nature-Printed\r\nSea-weeds.\" Both of these are however costly. Among the cheaper works\r\nare \"British Sea-weeds,\" by S. O. Gray (Lovell, Reeve & Co.),\r\n\"Harvey's Manual\" and an abridgment by Mrs. A. Gatty, with reduced but\r\nwell executed copies of the figures, of the Phycologia. This synopsis\r\ncan often be picked up cheap at second-hand book-stalls; and there is\r\na very excellent low-priced work suitable for amateurs, Grattann's\r\n\"British Marine Algae,\" containing recognizable figures of nearly all\r\nour native species. Landsborough's \"Popular History of British\r\nSea-weeds,\" and Mrs. Lane Clarke's \"Common Sea-weeds,\" are also cheap\r\nand useful manuals on the subject.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Floral design]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELLS.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nB. B. WOODWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POND SNAILS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very earliest times, long before there was any attempt at the\r\nscientific classification and arrangement of shells, they appear to\r\nhave been objects of admiration, and to have been valued on account of\r\ntheir beauty, for we find that the pre-historic men, who, in company\r\nwith the mammoth, or hairy elephant, and other animals now extinct,\r\ninhabited Southern France in days long gone by, used to bore holes in\r\nthem, and, like the savage of to-day, wear them as ornaments. The\r\nGreek physician and philosopher, Aristotle, is said to have been the\r\nfirst to study the formation of shells, and to raise the knowledge\r\nthus acquired into the position of a science; by him shells were\r\ndivided into three orders--an arrangement preserved, with some small\r\nchanges, by Linnaeus. It is possible that the world-wide renown of the\r\nSwedish naturalist during the last century, and the ardour with which\r\nhe pursued his investigations, may have given an impetus to the study\r\nof natural objects, for we find that at that period large sums were\r\noften given by collectors for choice specimens of shells. Nor is this\r\nto be wondered at, for few things look nicer, or better repay trouble\r\nexpended on them, than does a well-arranged and carefully mounted and\r\nnamed collection of shells. Certainly nothing looks worse than a\r\nnumber of shells of all descriptions, of every kind, shape, and\r\ncolour, thrown promiscuously into a box, like the unfortunate animals\r\nin a toy Noah's ark, to the great detriment of their value and beauty;\r\nfor, as the inevitable result of shaking against each other, the\r\nnatural polish is taken off some, the delicate points and ornaments\r\nare broken off others, the whole collection becoming in time unsightly\r\nand disappointing, and all for want of a little care at the outset.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in every other undertaking, \"how to set about it\" is the\r\nchief difficulty with beginners; and here, perhaps, a few hints\r\ngathered from experience may not be without value. One thing a young\r\ncollector should always bear in mind, however, is, that no\r\ninstructions can be of any avail to him unless, for his part, he is\r\nprepared to bring patience, neatness, and attention to detail, to bear\r\nupon his work.\r\n\r\nSince it is important to know the best way of storing specimens\r\nalready acquired, we will, in the first place, devote a few words to\r\nthis point, and then proceed to describe the best means of collecting\r\nspecimens, and of naming, mounting, and arranging the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a common mistake, both with old and young, to imagine that a\r\nhandsome cabinet is, in the first instance, a necessity; but no\r\ngreater blunder can be made: the cabinet should be considered merely\r\nan accessory, the collection itself being just as valuable, and\r\ngenerally more useful, when kept in a series of plain wooden or\r\ncardboard boxes. We intend, therefore, to describe the simplest\r\npossible means of keeping a collection of shells, leaving elaborate\r\nand costly methods to those who value the case more than its contents.\r\n\r\nThe first thing required is some method of keeping the different\r\nspecies of shells apart, so that they may not get mixed, or be\r\ndifficult to find when wanted. The simplest plan of doing this is to\r\ncollect all the empty chip match-boxes you can find, throw away the\r\ncases in which they slide, and keep the trays, trying to get as many\r\nof a size as possible. (The ordinary Bryant & May's, or Bell &\r\nBlack's, are the most useful, and with them the trays of the small\r\nSwedish match-boxes, two of which, placed side by side, occupy nearly\r\nexactly the same space as one and a half of the larger size, and so\r\nfit in with them nicely.) In these trays your shells should be placed,\r\none kind in each tray; but although very convenient for most\r\nspecimens, they will of course be too small for very many, and so the\r\nlarger trays must be made. This may easily be done as follows: cut a\r\nrectangular piece of cardboard two inches longer one way than the\r\nlength of the match-tray, and two inches more the other way than twice\r\nthe width of the match-tray; then with a pencil rule lines one inch\r\nfrom the edges and parallel with them (Fig. 1); next cut out the\r\nlittle squares (_a_ _a_, _a_ _a_) these lines form in the corners of\r\nthe piece of cardboard, and then with a penknife cut _half_ through the\r\ncard, exactly on the remaining pencil-lines, and bend up the pieces,\r\nwhich will then form sides for your tray; and by binding it round with\r\na piece of blue paper, you will have one that will look neat, uniform\r\nwith the others, and yet be just twice their size. If required, you\r\ncan make in the same way any size, only take care that they are all\r\nmultiples of one standard size, as loss of space will thereby be\r\navoided when you come to the next process in your cabinet. This is, to\r\nget a large box or tray in which to hold your smaller ones.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 1. How to cut a cardboard tray.]\r\n\r\n      +---+-----------+---+\r\n      |_a_|           |_a_|\r\n      +---+-----------+---+\r\n      |   |           |   |\r\n      |   |           |   |\r\n      |   |           |   |\r\n      |   |           |   |\r\n      |   |           |   |\r\n      |   |           |   |\r\n      |   |           |   |\r\n      |   |           |   |\r\n      +---+-----------+---+\r\n      |_a_|           |_a_|\r\n      +---+-----------+---+\r\n\r\nThe simplest plan is to get some half-dozen cardboard boxes (such as\r\nmay be obtained for the asking or for a very trifling cost at any\r\ndraper's), having a depth of from one to two inches (according to the\r\nsize of your shells); in these your trays may be arranged in columns,\r\nand the boxes can be kept one above the other in a cupboard or in a\r\nlarger box. More boxes and trays can, from time to time, be added as\r\noccasion requires, and thus the whole collection may be kept in good\r\nworking order at a trifling cost. A more durable form of cheap cabinet\r\nmay be made by collecting the wooden boxes so common in grocers'\r\nshops, cleaning them with sand-paper, staining and varnishing them\r\noutside, and lining them inside with paper; or, if handy at\r\ncarpentering, you may make all your boxes, or even a real cabinet, for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO COLLECT SHELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvision being thus made for the comfortable accommodation of your\r\ntreasures, the next consideration is, how to set about collecting\r\nthem. Mollusca are to be found all over the globe, from the frozen\r\nnorth to the sun-baked tropics, on the land or in lakes, rivers, or\r\nseas--wherever, in fact, they can find the food and other conditions\r\nsuitable for their growth and development; but the collector who is\r\nnot also a great traveller, must of course rely for his foreign\r\nspecimens upon the generosity of friends, or else procure them from\r\ndealers. In most districts of our own country, there are, however, to\r\nbe found large numbers of shells whose variety and beauty will\r\nastonish and reward the efforts of any patient seeker. Begin with your\r\nown garden,--search in the out-of-the-way, and especially damp,\r\ncorners; turn over the flower-pots and stones which have lain longest\r\nin one place, search amongst the roots of the grass growing under\r\nwalls, and in the moss round the roots of the trees, and you will be\r\nsurprised at the number of different shells you may find in a very\r\nshort space of time. When the resources of the garden have been\r\nexhausted, go into the nearest lanes and again search the grass and at\r\nthe roots of plants, especially the nettles which grow beside ditches\r\nand in damp places; hunt amongst the dead leaves in plantations, and\r\nliterally leave no stone unturned. All the apparatus it is necessary\r\nto take on these excursions consists of a few small match or\r\npill-boxes in which to carry home the specimens; a pair of forceps to\r\npick up the smaller ones, or to get them out of cracks; a hooked stick\r\nto beat down and pull away the nettles; and, above all, sharp eyes\r\ntrained to powers of observation. The best time to go out, is just\r\nafter a warm shower, when all the grass and leaves are still wet, for\r\nthe land-snails are very fond of moisture, and the shower entices them\r\nout of their lurking-places. Where the ground is made of chalk or\r\nlimestone, they will be found most abundant; for as the snail's shell\r\nis composed of layers of animal tissue, strengthened by depositions of\r\ncalcareous earthy-matter which the creature gets from the plants on\r\nwhich it feeds, and these in their turn obtain from the soil--it\r\nnaturally follows that the snail prefers to dwell where that article\r\nis most abundant, as an hour's hunt on any chalk-down will soon show.\r\n\r\nWhen garden and lanes are both exhausted, you may then turn to the\r\nponds and streams in the neighbourhood, where you will find several\r\nnew kinds. Some will be crawling up the rushes near the margin of the\r\nwater, others will be found in the water near the bank, while others\r\nmay be obtained by pulling on shore pieces of wood and branches that\r\nmay be floating in the water; but the best are sure to be beyond the\r\nreach of arm or stick, and it will be necessary to employ a net, which\r\nmay be easily made by bending a piece of wire into a circle of about\r\nfour inches in diameter, and sewing to it a small gauze bag; it may be\r\nmounted either on a long bamboo, or, better still, on one of those\r\ningenious Japanese walking-stick fishing-rods. For heavier work,\r\nhowever, such as getting fresh-water mussels and other mollusca from\r\nthe bottom, you will require a net something like the accompanying\r\nfigure (Fig. 2), about one foot in diameter. This, when attached to a\r\nlong rope, may be thrown out some distance and dragged through the\r\nwater-weeds to the shore, or if made with a square instead of a\r\ncircular mouth, it may be so weighted that it will sink to the bottom,\r\nand be used as a dredge for catching the mussels which live\r\nhalf-buried in the mud. To carry the water-snails home, you will find\r\nit necessary to have tin boxes (empty mustard-tins are the best), as\r\nmatch-boxes come to pieces when wetted.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 2. Net for taking water-snails.]\r\n\r\nThe finest collections of shells, however, are to be made at the\r\nsea-side, for the marine mollusca are both more varied in kind and\r\nmore abundant than the land and fresh-water ones, and quite an\r\nextensive collection may be made in the course of an afternoon's\r\nramble along the shore; it is necessary, however, to carefully reject\r\nsuch specimens as are worn by having been rolled by the waves upon the\r\nbeach, as they are not of any great value in a collection; it is\r\nbetter, in fact, if possible, to go down to the rocks at low water and\r\ncollect the living specimens. Search well about and under the\r\nsea-weeds, and in the rock-pools, and, when boating, throw your\r\ndredge-net out and tow it behind, hauling it in occasionally to see\r\nwhat you have caught, and to empty the stones and rubbish out.\r\n\r\nAt low tide also, look out for rocks with a number of round holes in\r\nthem, all close together, for in these holes the Pholas (Fig. 22)\r\ndwells, having bored a burrow in the solid rock, though _how_ he does\r\nit we do not yet quite know.\r\n\r\nThe Razor-shells and Cockles live in the sand, their presence being\r\nindicated by a small round hole; but they bury themselves so fast that\r\nyou will find it difficult to get at them. Some good specimens, too,\r\nof the deeper water forms are sure to be found near the spots where\r\nfishermen drag their boats ashore, as they are often thrown away in\r\nclearing out the nets; moreover, if you can make friends with any of\r\nthe said fishermen, they will be able to find and bring you many nice\r\nspecimens from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe reason that so much has been said about collecting living\r\nspecimens, is not only because in them the shell is more likely to be\r\nperfect, but also because in its living state the shell is coated with\r\na layer of animal matter, sometimes thin and transparent, at others\r\nthick and opaque, called the _periostracum_ (or _epidermis_), which\r\nserves to protect the shell from the weather, but which perishes with\r\nthe animal, so that dead shells which have lain for some time\r\ntenantless on the ground, or at the bottom of the water, exposed to\r\nthe destructive agencies that are constantly at work in nature, have\r\nalmost invariably lost both their natural polish and their varied\r\nhues, and are besides only too often broken as well. Since, however,\r\neven a damaged specimen is better than none at all, such should always\r\nbe kept until a more perfect example can be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO PREPARE THE SHELLS FOR THE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question with which we have next to deal is, after collecting a\r\nnumber of living mollusks, how, in the quickest and most painless\r\nmanner possible, to kill the animals in order to obtain possession of\r\ntheir shells. There is but one way we know of in which this may be\r\naccomplished, and that is by placing the creatures in an earthen jar\r\nand pouring _boiling_ water on them. With land, or fresh-water snails,\r\nthe addition of a large spoonful of table-salt is advisable, as it\r\nacts upon them chemically, and not only puts them sooner out of pain,\r\nbut also renders their subsequent extraction far easier. Death by this\r\nprocess is instantaneous, and consequently painless; but to leave\r\nsnails in cold salt water is to inflict on them the tortures of a\r\nlingering death; while for the brutality of gardeners and other\r\nthoughtless persons who seek to destroy the poor snail they find\r\neating their plants by crushing it under foot on the gravel path, no\r\nwords of condemnation are too strong, since it must always be borne in\r\nmind that snails have not, like us, _one_ nervous centre, but three,\r\nand are far more tenacious of life; hence, unless all the nerves are\r\ndestroyed at once, a great deal of suffering is entailed on the poor\r\ncreature; and if merely crushed under foot, the mangled portions _will\r\nlive for hours_. Hot water has also the advantage of tending to remove\r\nthe dirt which is almost sure to have gathered on the shells, and so\r\nhelping to prepare them better for the cabinet. As soon as the water\r\nis cool enough, fish out the shells one by one and proceed to extract\r\nthe dead animals. This, if the mollusk is _univalve_ (_i.e._, whose\r\nshell is composed of a single piece), such as an ordinary garden\r\nsnail, can easily be done by picking them out with a pin; you will\r\nfind, probably, that some of the smaller ones have shrunk back so far\r\ninto their shells as to be beyond the reach of a straight pin, so it\r\nwill be necessary to bend the pin with a pair of pliers, or, if none\r\nare at hand, a key will answer the purpose if the pin be put into one\r\nof the notches and bent over the edge until sufficiently curved to\r\nreach up the shell. You will find it convenient to keep a set of pins\r\nbent to different curves, to which you may fit handles by cutting off\r\nthe heads and sticking them into match stems. It is a good plan to\r\nsoak some of the smaller snails in clean cold water before killing\r\nthem, as they swell out with the water, and do not, when dead, retreat\r\nso far into their shells. If you have a microscope, and wish to keep\r\nthe animals till you have time to get the tongues out, drop the bodies\r\ninto small bottles of methylated spirit and water, when they will keep\r\ntill required, otherwise they should of course be thrown away at once.\r\nThe now empty shells should be washed in clean warm water, and, if\r\nvery dirty, gently scrubbed with a soft nail or tooth brush, and then\r\ncarefully dried.\r\n\r\nIn such shells as the Periwinkle, Whelk, etc., whose inhabitants close\r\nthe entrance of their dwelling with a trap-door, or _operculum_ as it\r\nis called, you should be careful to preserve each with its proper\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nIf you are cleaning _bivalves_, or shells composed of two pieces, like\r\nthe common mussel, you will have to remove the animal with a penknife,\r\nand while leaving the inside quite clean, be very careful not to break\r\nthe ligament which serves as a hinge; then wash as before, and tie\r\nthem together to prevent their gaping open when dry.\r\n\r\nSometimes the fresh-water or marine shells are so coated over with a\r\nvegetable growth that no scrubbing with water alone will remove it,\r\nand in these cases a weak solution of caustic soda may be used, but\r\nvery carefully, since, if too strong a solution be employed, the\r\nsurface of the shell will be removed with the dirt, and the specimen\r\nspoilt. In some shells the periostracum is very thick and coarse, and\r\nmust be removed before the shell itself can be seen; but it is always\r\nwell to keep at least one specimen in its rough state as an example.\r\nIn other shells the periostracum is covered over with very fine,\r\ndelicate hairs (_Helix sericea_ and _Helix hispida_, Fig. 3), and\r\ngreat care must then be taken not to brush these off.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 3. (_a_) _Helix sericea_ and\r\n     (_b_) _Helix hispida_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MOUNT THE SHELLS FOR THE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the specimens are thoroughly cleaned, the next process is to sort\r\nout the different kinds, placing each description in a different tray,\r\nand then to get them ready for mounting, for no collection will look\r\nwell unless each kind is so arranged that it may be seen to the best\r\nadvantage, and is also carefully named. Where you have a good number,\r\npick out first the largest specimens of their kind, then the smallest,\r\nthen a series, as you have room for them, of the most perfect; and\r\nfinally those which show any peculiarity of structure or marking. Try,\r\ntoo, to get young forms as well as adult, for the young are often very\r\ndifferent in appearance from the full-grown shell. Mark on them,\r\nespecially on such as you have found yourself, the locality they came\r\nfrom, as it is very important to the shell collector to know this,\r\nsince specimens common enough in one district are often rare in\r\nanother. Either write the name of the place in ink on a corner of the\r\nshell itself, or gum a small label just inside it, or simply number\r\nit, and write the name of the place with a corresponding number\r\nagainst it in a book kept for the purpose. Next select a tray large\r\nenough to hold all you have of this kind; place a piece of cotton wool\r\nat the bottom, and lay your shells upon it. For small shells, however,\r\nthis method is not suitable, as the cotton wool acts on them like a\r\nspring mattress, and they are liable on the least shock to be jerked\r\nout of their trays and lost. This difficulty may be met by cutting a\r\npiece of cardboard so that it just fits into your tray, and then\r\ngumming the shells on to it in rows; but remember that, in this plan\r\nof mounting, it is impossible to take the shells up and examine them\r\non all sides as you do the loose ones, and so you must mount a good\r\nmany, and place them in many different positions, so that they may be\r\nseen from as many points of view as possible. The gum used should\r\nalways have nearly one-sixth of its bulk of pure glycerine added to\r\nit; this prevents it from becoming brittle when dry, otherwise your\r\nspecimens would be liable after a time to break away from the card and\r\nget lost. If the shells will not stay in the position you require,\r\nwedge them up with little pieces of cork until the gum is dry.\r\n\r\nWhen the shells are mounted, you must try, if you have not already\r\ndone so, to get the proper names for them; it is as important to be\r\nable to call shells by their right names as it is to know people by\r\ntheirs. The commoner sorts you will be able to name from the figures\r\nof them given in text-books, such as those quoted in the list at the\r\nend of this little work; but some you will find it very difficult to\r\nname, and it will then be necessary to ask friends who have\r\ncollections to help you, or to take them to some museum and compare\r\nthem with the named specimens there exhibited. When the right name is\r\ndiscovered, your label must then be written in a very small, neat\r\nhand, and gummed to the edge of the tray or on the card if your\r\nspecimens are mounted. At the top you put the Latin name, ruling a\r\nline underneath it, and then, if you like, add the English name; next,\r\nput the name of the place and the date at which it was found, thus:--\r\n\r\n  =====================================\r\n      Helix aspersa (Common snail),\r\n      -----------------------------\r\n      Lane near Hampstead Heath,\r\n      July 10th, 1882.\r\n  =====================================\r\n\r\nA double red ink line ruled at the top and bottom will add a finished\r\nappearance to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO CLASSIFY THE SHELLS FOR THE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing processes, except the naming of your specimens, are\r\nmore or less mechanical, and are only the means to the end--a properly\r\narranged collection. For, however well a collection may be mounted, it\r\nis practically useless if the different shells composing it be not\r\nproperly classified. By classification is meant the bringing together\r\nthose kinds that most resemble each other, first of all into large\r\ngroups having special characteristics in common, and then by\r\nsubdividing these into other smaller groups, and so on. Thus the\r\nanimal kingdom is divided, first of all, into _Sub-kingdoms_, then\r\neach _Sub-kingdom_ into so many _Classes_ containing those which have\r\nfurther characteristics in common, the _Classes_ into _Orders_, the\r\n_Orders_ into _Families_, the _Families_ into _Genera_, and these\r\nagain into species or kinds.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca, or soft-bodied animals, of whose protecting shells your\r\ncollection consists, form a sub-kingdom, and are subdivided into four\r\nclasses:--\r\n\r\n  1. Cephalopoda.\r\n  2. Gasteropoda.\r\n  3. Pteropoda.\r\n  4. Lamellibranchiata (or Conchifera).\r\n\r\nAnd these again into Families, Genera, and Species.\r\n\r\nThe space at our disposal being limited, it is impossible to do more\r\nthan furnish some general outlines of the different forms. For further\r\ndetails it will be necessary to refer to one of the larger works, a\r\nlist of which will be found on the last page.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 4. _Argonauta Argo._]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 5. \"Bone\" of _Sepia officinalis_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--The CEPHALOPODA (Head-footed) contains those mollusca that,\r\nlike the common Octopus, have a number of feet (or arms) set round\r\nthe mouth, and is divided into those having two gills. (Order I.\r\nDibranchiata); and those with four (Order II. Tetrabranchiata). Order\r\nI. is again divided into: (_a._) Those with _eight_ feet like the\r\nArgonaut (or Paper-nautilus, Fig. 4), which fable has so long endowed\r\nwith the power of sailing on the surface of the ocean, (it is even\r\nrepresented in one book as propelling itself through the air!) and the\r\ncommon Octopus. (_b._) Those with _ten_ feet, such as the Loligo (or\r\nSquid, Fig. 6), whose delicate internal shell so much resembles a pen\r\nin shape; the Cuttle-fish (Sepia, Figs. 5 & 7), whose so-called\r\n\"bone\" (once largely used as an ink eraser) is frequently found on our\r\nsouthern coasts; and the pretty little _Spirula_ (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 6. _Loligo vulgaris_, and \"Pen.\"]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 7. _Sepia officinalis._]\r\n\r\nThe only representative of the four-gilled order now living is the\r\nwell-known Pearly Nautilus; but in former times the Tetrabranchiata\r\nwere extremely numerous, especially the _Ammonites_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 8. _Spirula_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--GASTEROPODA (Belly-footed) comprises those mollusca which,\r\nlike the common snail, creep on the under-surface of the body, and\r\nwith one exception (_Chiton_, Fig. 20) their shells are univalve\r\n(_i.e._, composed of one piece). But before we go further, it may be\r\nwell to point out the names given to different parts of a univalve\r\nshell. The aperture whence the animal issues is called the _mouth_,\r\nand its outer edge the _lip_; each turn of the shell is a _whorl_; the\r\nlast and biggest, the _body-whorl_, the whorls, from the point at the\r\ntop, or _apex_, down to the mouth form the _spire_; and the line where\r\nthe whorls join each other is called the _suture_. The axis of the\r\nshell around which the whorls are coiled is sometimes open or hollow,\r\nand the shell is then said to be _umbilicated_ (as in Fig. 3_b_); when\r\nclosely coiled, a pillar of shell, or _columella_, is left (as in Fig.\r\n9). Sometimes the corner of the mouth farthest from the spire and\r\nnext the columella, is produced into a channel, the _anterior canal_\r\n(as in Fig. 9); whilst where the mouth meets the base of the spire\r\nthere may be a kind of notch which is termed the _posterior canal_.\r\nMost Gasteropods are _dextral_, that is to say, the mouth is to the\r\nright of the axis as you look at it; a few, however, are _sinistral_,\r\nor wound to the left (like _Physa_); whilst reversed varieties of both\r\nkinds are met with.\r\n\r\nGasteropods of the first order have comb-like gills placed in advance\r\nof the heart, and are hence termed PROSOBRANCHIATA. They are divided\r\ninto two groups: (_a_) _Siphonostomata_ (Tube-mouthed), in which the\r\nanimal has a long proboscis, and a tube, or siphon, from the\r\nbreathing-chamber that passes along the anterior canal of the shell,\r\nwhich in this group is well developed. They have a horny operculum, or\r\nlid, with which to close the aperture. (_b_) _Holostomata_ (or\r\nWhole-mouthed). In these the siphon is not so produced, and does not\r\nwant to be protected; accordingly the mouth of the shell is _entire_,\r\n_i.e._ has no canal. The operculum is horny or shelly. The former\r\n(group _a_) includes several families:\r\n\r\n1. _Strombidae_, comprising shells, like the huge _Strombus_, or\r\n\"Fountain-shell,\" which is so often used to adorn the mantelpiece or\r\nrockery, and from which cameos are cut.\r\n\r\n2. The _Muricidae_, of which the _Murex_ (an extraordinary form of this\r\nis the \"Venus' comb,\" _Murex tenuispina_, Fig. 9), the Mitre-shells,\r\nand the Red-Whelks (_Fusus_) are examples.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 9. _Murex tenuispina._]\r\n\r\n3. The _Buccinidae_, taking its name from its type, the Common Whelk\r\n(_Buccinum undatum_), and including such other forms as the Dog-Whelk\r\n(_Nassa_), the _Purpura_, the strange _Magilus_, and the lovely\r\nHarp-Shells and Olives (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 10. _Oliva tessellata._]\r\n\r\n4. The _Cassididae_, or \"Helmet-Shells.\" _Cassis rufa_, from West\r\nAfrica, is noted as the best species of shell for cameo engraving;\r\nwith it are classed the \"Tun\" (_Dolium_) and the great \"Triton\"\r\n(_Triton tritonis_), such as the sea-gods of mythology are represented\r\nblowing into by way of trumpet, and which are used by the Polynesian\r\nIslanders to this day instead of horns.\r\n\r\n5. The _Conidae_, whose type, the \"Cone-shell\" (Fig. 11), is at once\r\ndistinctive and handsome, but which in the living state is covered by\r\na dull yellowish-brown periostracum that has to be carefully removed\r\nbefore the full beauties of the shell are displayed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 11. Conus vermiculatus.]\r\n\r\n6. The _Volutidae_, embracing the Volutes and \"Boat-shells\" (_Cymba_).\r\n\r\n7. The _Cypraeidae_, or Cowries (Fig. 12), which owe their high polish\r\nto the size of the shell-secreting organ (mantle), whose edges meet\r\nover the back of the shell, concealing it within its folds. With these\r\nis classed the \"China-shell\" (_Ovulum_).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 12. Cypraea oniscus.]\r\n\r\nThe second group, or _Holostomata_, is divided into nineteen families,\r\nbeginning with--\r\n\r\n1. The _Naticidae_, whose type, the genus _Natica_, is well known to\r\nall shell-collectors through the common _Natica monilifera_ of our\r\ncoasts.\r\n\r\n2. The _Cancellariadae_, in which the shells are cancellated or\r\ncross-barred by a double series of lines running, one set with the\r\nwhorls, and the other across them.\r\n\r\n3. The _Pyramidellidae_, which are high-spired, elongated, and slender\r\nshells, with the exception of the genus _Stylina_, which lives\r\nattached to the spines of sea-urchins or buried in living star-fishes\r\nand corals. 4. The _Solaridae_ or \"Staircase-shells,\" whose umbilicus\r\nis so wide that, as you look down it, the projecting edges of the\r\nwhorls appear like a winding staircase. It is a very short-spired\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n5. The _Scalaridae_, \"Wentle-traps\" or \"Ladder-shells,\" which may be\r\nreadily recognised from their white and lustrous appearance and the\r\nstrong rib-like markings of the periodic mouths that encircle the\r\nwhorls.\r\n\r\n6. The _Cerithiadae_, or \"Horn-shells,\" which are very high-spired, and\r\nwhose columella and anterior canal are produced in the form of an\r\nimpudent little tail, the effect of which, however, in the genus\r\n_Aporrhais_, or \"Spout-shells,\" is taken away by the expanded and\r\nthickened lip.\r\n\r\n7. In the next family, the _Turritellidae_, or \"Tower-shells,\" the type\r\nTurritella is spiral; but in the allied form _Vermetus_, though the\r\nspire begins in the natural manner, it goes off into a twisted tube\r\nresembling somewhat an ill-made corkscrew. The mouth in this family is\r\noften nearly round.\r\n\r\n8. The _Melaniadae_, and 9. The _Paludinidae_, are fresh-water shells.\r\nThe former are turreted, and the latter conical or globular. Both are\r\nfurnished with opercula, but the mouth in the first is more or less\r\noval and frequently notched in front, while in the latter it is\r\nrounded and entire.\r\n\r\n10. The _Litorinidae_, or Periwinkles, need no word from us.\r\n\r\n11. The _Calyptraeidae_ comprise the \"Bonnet-limpet,\" or _Pileopsis_,\r\nand \"Cup-and-saucer-limpets\" (_Calyptraea_). They may be described\r\nbriefly as limpets with traces of a spire left. The genus _Phorus_,\r\nhowever, is spiral, and resembles a _Trochus_. They have been called\r\n\"Carriers\" from their strange habit of building any stray fragments of\r\nshell or stone into their house, thus rendering themselves almost\r\nindistinguishable from the ground on which they crawl.\r\n\r\n12. The _Turbinidae_, or \"Top-shells,\" are next in order, and of these\r\nthe great _Turbo marmoreus_ is a well-known example, being prepared as\r\nan ornament for the whatnot or mantelpiece by removing the external\r\nlayer of the shell in order to display the brilliant pearly nacre\r\nbelow. These mollusca close their mouths with a horny operculum,\r\ncoated on its exterior by a thick layer of porcelain-like shelly\r\nmatter. With them are classed the familiar _Trochus_ and other closely\r\nallied genera.\r\n\r\n13. The _Haliotidae_ offer in the representative genus _Haliotis_, or\r\nthe \"Ear-shell,\" another familiar mantelpiece ornament.\r\n\r\n14. The _Ianthinidae_, or \"Violet-snails,\" that float about in\r\nmid-Atlantic upon the gulf-weed, and at certain seasons secrete a\r\ncurious float or raft, to which their eggs are attached, are next in\r\norder, and are followed by--\r\n\r\n15. The _Fissurellidae_, or \"Key-hole\" and \"Notched limpets,\" whose\r\nname sufficiently describes them. To these succeed--\r\n\r\n16. The _Neritidae_, an unmistakable group of globular shells, having\r\nnext to no spire and a very glossy exterior, generally ornamented with\r\na great variety of spots and bands.\r\n\r\n17. The _Patellidae_, or true Limpets, are well known to every sea-side\r\nvisitor: large species, as much as two inches across, are to be found\r\non the coast of Devon, but these are pigmies compared with a South\r\nAmerican variety which attains a foot in diameter.\r\n\r\n18. The _Dentaliadae_, represented by the genus _Dentalium_, or\r\n\"Tooth-shell,\" are simply slightly curved tubes, open at both ends and\r\ntapering from the mouth downwards, and cannot be mistaken.\r\n\r\n19. Lastly, we have the _Chitonidae_, whose single genus _Chiton_\r\npossesses shells differing from all other mollusca in being composed\r\nof eight plates overlapping each other, and in appearance reminding\r\none of the wood-louse. This animal is not only like the limpet in form\r\nbut also in habits, being found adhering to the rocks and stones at\r\nlow-water.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder II.--PULMONIFERA. Contains the air-breathing _Gasteropods_, and\r\nto it consequently belong all the terrestrial mollusca, though some\r\nfew aquatic genera are also included. The members of this order have\r\nan air-chamber instead of gills, and are divided into two groups,\r\n(_a_) those without an operculum, and (_b_) those having an operculum.\r\nForemost in the first group stands the great family--\r\n\r\n1. _Helicidae_, named after its chief representative, the genus\r\n_Helix_. It also includes the \"Glass-shell\" (_Vitrina_), the\r\n\"Amber-shell\" (_Succinea_), and such genera as _Bulimus_, _Achatina_,\r\n_Pupa_, _Clausilia_ (Fig. 13), etc., which differ from the typical\r\n_Helix_ in appearance, possessing as they do comparatively high\r\nspires.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 13. _Clausilia biplicata._]\r\n\r\n2. The _Limacidae_, or \"slugs,\" follow next; of these only one, the\r\ngenus _Testacella_, has an external shell stuck on the end of its\r\ntail; the rest have either a more or less imperfect shell concealed\r\nunderneath the mantle, or else none at all.\r\n\r\n3. The _Oncidiadae_ are slug-like, and devoid of shell.\r\n\r\n4. The _Limnaeidae_ embrace the \"Pond-snails,\" chief of whom is the\r\nwell-known, high-spired _Limnaea stagnalis_. Other shells of this\r\nfamily associated with _Limnaea_ are, however, very different in shape;\r\nfor instance, _Physa_ has its whorls turning to the left instead of to\r\nthe right; _Ancylus_ (Fig. 24), or the freshwater limpet, is of course\r\nlimpet-like; while _Planorbis_, or the \"Coil-shell,\" is wound like a\r\nwatch-spring.\r\n\r\n5. The _Auriculidae_ includes both spiral shells, such as _Auricula_\r\nand _Charychium_, and a limpet-like one _Siphonaria_.\r\n\r\nAt the head of group _b_ stands 1, _Cyclostomidae_. _Cyclostoma\r\nelegans_ is a common shell on our chalk-downs, and well illustrates\r\nits family, in which the mouth is nearly circular. Foreign examples of\r\nthis genus are much esteemed by collectors. The other two families\r\nare, (2) _Helicinidae_ and (3) _Aciculidae_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder III.--OPISTHOBRANCHIATA. These animals carry their gills exposed\r\non the back and sides, towards the rear of the body. Only a few have\r\nany shell. 1. The _Tornatellidae_, which have a stout little spiral\r\nshell. 2. The _Bullidae_, in which the spire is concealed (Fig. 26). 3.\r\nThe _Aplysiadae_, where the shell is flat and oblong or triangular in\r\nshape. The remaining families are slug-like and shell-less.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 14. _Bulla ampulla._]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder IV.--NUCLEOBRANCHIATA. Derives its name from the fact that the\r\nanimals constituting it have their respiratory and digestive organs in\r\na sort of nucleus on the posterior part of the back, and covered by a\r\nminute shell. As they are pelagic, the shells are not readily to be\r\nobtained. They are divided into two families, _Firolidae_ and\r\n_Atlantidae_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--PTEROPODA. Like the last, these pretty little mollusca are\r\nocean-swimmers. The members of one division of them, to which the\r\n_Cleodora_ belongs, is furnished with iridescent external shells.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 15. _Petunculus guerangeri._]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 16. _Venus plicata._]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS IV.--The LAMELLIBRANCHIATA (Plate-gilled), or CONCHIFERA\r\n(Shell-bearing), includes the mollusca commonly known as \"bivalves,\"\r\nthe animal being snugly hidden between two more or less closely\r\nfitting shelly valves. The oysters, cockles, etc., are examples of\r\nthis class. The two valves are fastened together near their points, or\r\nbeaks (technically called _umbones_), by a tough elastic ligament,\r\nsometimes supplemented by an internal cartilage. If this be severed\r\nand the valves parted, it will be found that in most cases they are\r\nfurther articulated by projecting ridges or points called the _teeth_,\r\nwhich, when the valves are together, interlock and form a hinge; the\r\nmargin of the shell on which the teeth and ligament are situated is\r\ntermed the _hinge-line_. A bivalve is said to be _equivalve_ when the\r\ntwo shells composing it are of the same size, _inequivalve_ when they\r\nare not. If the umbones are in the middle, the shell is _equilateral_\r\n(Fig. 15); but _inequilateral_ when they are nearer one side than the\r\nother (Fig. 16). If the shell be an oyster or a scallop, you will find\r\non the inside a single circular scar-like mark near the centre; this\r\nis the point to which the muscles that close the valves and hold them\r\nso tightly together are attached. In the majority of bivalves,\r\nhowever, there are two such muscular impressions, or scars, one on\r\neither side of each valve of the shell. The former group on this\r\naccount are often called _Monomyaria_ (having one shell-muscle), and\r\nthe latter _Dimyaria_ (having two shell-muscles). In the last named\r\nthe two muscular impressions are united by a fine groove (or\r\n_pallial-line_), which in some runs parallel to the margin of the\r\nshell (Fig. 15), whilst in others it makes a bend in (_pallial-sinus_)\r\non one side of the valve towards the centre (Fig. 16). In Monomyaria\r\nit will be found running parallel to the margin of the shell. It marks\r\nthe line of attachment of the mantle or shell-secreting organ of the\r\nanimal to the shell which grows by the addition of fresh matter along\r\nits edges, so that the concentric curved markings so often seen on the\r\nexterior correspond in their origin with the periodic mouths of the\r\nGasteropods. The bivalves are all aquatic, and many bury themselves in\r\nthe sand or mud by means of a fleshy, muscular foot. These are\r\nfurnished with two siphons, or fleshy tubes, sometimes united,\r\nsometimes separate, through which they respire, drawing the water in\r\nthrough one and expelling it by the other. Those kinds whose habit it\r\nis to bury themselves below the surface of the mud or sand are\r\nfurnished with long retractile siphons, and to admit of their\r\nwithdrawal into the shell, the mantle is at this point attached\r\nfarther back, giving rise to the _pallial-sinus_ above described; this\r\nsinus is deeper as the siphons are proportionately longer, and in\r\nmany cases, too, the valves do not meet at this point when the shell\r\nis closed.\r\n\r\nAttention to these particulars is necessary when arranging your\r\nbivalves, as on them their classification depends, the class being\r\ndivided into--\r\n\r\n_a._ ASIPHONIDA (Siphonless).\r\n\r\n_b._ SIPHONIDA _Integro-pallialia_ (with Siphons).--Pallial-line entire.\r\n\r\n_c._ SIPHONIDA _Sinu-pallialia_ (with Siphons).--Sinus in pallial-line.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION _a_.--ASIPHONIDA--is next subdivided into--\r\n\r\n1. The _Ostreidae_, or oysters, which are deservedly a distinct family\r\nin themselves.\r\n\r\n2. The _Anomiadae_, comprising the multiform and curiously constructed\r\n_Anomia_, with the \"Window-shells\" (_Placuna_).\r\n\r\n3. The _Pectinidae_, taking its name from the genus _Pecten_, or\r\n\"Scallop-shells,\" of which one kind (_P. maximus_) is frequently to be\r\nseen at the fishmongers' shops. The \"Thorney oysters\" (_Spondylus_)\r\ntake rank here, and are highly esteemed by collectors, one specimen\r\nindeed having been valued at L25!\r\n\r\n4. The _Aviculidae_, or \"Wing-shells,\" among which are numbered the\r\n\"Pearl-oyster\" of commerce (_Meleagrina margaritifera_). The strange\r\nT-shaped \"Hammer oyster\" belongs to this family, as does also the\r\n_Pinna_. The Pinnas, like the mussels and some other bivalves, moor\r\nthemselves to rocks by means of a number of threads spun by the foot\r\nof the mollusc, and termed the _byssus_, which in this genus is finer,\r\nmore silky, than in any other, and has been woven into articles of\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n5. The _Mytilidae_, or mussels, including the _Lithodomus_, or\r\n\"Date-shell,\" which bores into corals and even hard limestone rocks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 17. Hinge-teeth of _Arca barbata_.]\r\n\r\n6. The _Arcadae_, or \"Noah's-ark-shells,\" characterized by their long\r\nstraight hinge-line set with numerous very fine teeth (Fig. 17). The\r\n\"Nut-shell\" (_Nucula_) belongs to this family.\r\n\r\n7. The _Trigoniadae_, whose single living genus, the handsome _Trigonia_\r\n(Fig. 18), is confined to the Australian coast-line, whereas in times\r\nnow long past they had a world-wide distribution.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 18. _Trigonia margaritacea._]\r\n\r\n8. The _Unionidae_, comprising the fresh-water mussels.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION _b_.--SIPHONIDA _Integropallialia_.\r\n\r\n1. The _Chamidae_, represented by the reef-dwelling _Chama_.\r\n\r\n2. The _Tridacnidae_, whose sole genus _Tridacna_ contains the largest\r\nspecimen of the whole class of bivalves, the shells sometimes\r\nmeasuring two feet and more across.\r\n\r\n3. The _Cardiadae_, or cockles.\r\n\r\n4. The _Lucinidae_, in which the valves are nearly circular, and as a\r\nrule not very attractive in appearance, though the \"Basket-shell\"\r\n(_Corbis_) has an elegantly sculptured exterior.\r\n\r\n5. The _Cycladidae_, whose typical genus _Cyclas_, with its round form\r\nand thin horny shell, is to be found in most of our ponds and streams.\r\n\r\n6. The _Astartidae_, a family of shells having very strongly developed\r\nteeth, and the surface of whose valves is often concentrically ribbed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 19. Hinge of _Cardita sinuata_.]\r\n\r\n7. The _Cyprinidae_, which have very solid oval or elongated shells and\r\nconspicuous teeth (Fig. 19). The \"Heart-cockle\" (_Isocardia_) belongs to\r\nthis family.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION _c_.--SIPHONIDA _Sinu-pallialia_.\r\n\r\n1. The _Veneridae_. The hard, solid shells of this family are for\r\nelegance of form and beauty of colour amongst the most attractive a\r\ncollector can posses. Their shells are more or less oval and have\r\nthree teeth in each valve (Fig. 20).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 20. Hinge of _Cytherea crycina_.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 21. Hinge of _Lutraria elliptica_]\r\n\r\n2. The _Mactridae_ are somewhat triangular in shape, and may be at once\r\nrecognised by the pit for the hinge-ligament, which also assumes that\r\nform, as seen in the accompanying figure of _Lutraria elliptica_\r\n(Fig. 21).\r\n\r\n3. The _Tellinidae_ comprise some of the most delicately tinted, both\r\nexternally and internally, of all shells. In some, coloured bands\r\nradiate from the umbones, and well bear out the fanciful name of\r\n\"Sunset shells\" bestowed upon them. Their valves are generally much\r\ncompressed.\r\n\r\n4. The _Solenidae_, or \"Razor-shells,\" rank next, and are readily\r\nrecognised by the extreme length of the valves in proportion to their\r\nwidth, and also by their gaping at both ends.\r\n\r\n5. The _Myacidae_ or \"Gapers,\" have the siphonal ends wide apart (in\r\nthe genus _Mya_ both ends gape), and are further characterized by the\r\ntriangular process for the cartilage, which projects into the interior\r\nof the shell. One valve (the left) is generally smaller than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n6. The _Anatinidae_ have thin, often inequivalve pearly shells. The\r\ngenus _Pandora_ is the form most frequently met with in collections.\r\n\r\n7. The _Gastrochaenidae_ embraces two genera (_Gastrochaena_ and\r\n_Saxicava_) of boring mollusca, which perforate shells and rocks, and\r\nalso, the remarkable tube-like \"Watering-pot-shell\" (_Aspergillum_)\r\nwhich is hardly recognisable as a bivalve at all.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 22. _Pholas dactylus._]\r\n\r\n8. The _Pholadidae_ concludes the list of bivalves, and comprises the\r\ncommon rock-boring Pholas (Fig. 22) of our coasts and the wood-boring\r\nshipworm \"Teredo\" (Fig. 23).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the _Brachiopoda_, or \"Lamp-shells,\" are not true mollusca,\r\nthey are not very far removed from them, and are so often to be found\r\nin cabinets that it will not do to pass them over, especially since in\r\npast times they were very abundant, an enormous number occurring in\r\nthe fossil state. Only eight genera are now living. Shells belonging\r\nto this class are readily recognised by the fact of one valve being\r\nlarger than the other, and possessing a distinct peak, the apex of\r\nwhich is perforated. The _Terebratulidae_ are the most extensive family\r\nof this class.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 23. _Teredo navalis._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO ARRANGE THE SHELLS IN THE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you have arranged your specimens in the order above indicated,\r\nproceed to place them in your boxes, arranging and labelling them after\r\nthe manner shown in the accompanying diagram.\r\n\r\n  +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |  Class.  |          |          |          |          |\r\n  +----------+ Species. | Species. | Species. | Species. |\r\n  |  Order.  |          |          |          |          |\r\n  +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |  Family  |          |          |          |          |\r\n  |  Name.   |          |          |          |          |\r\n  +----------+ Species. | Species. | Species. | Species. |\r\n  | Generic  |          |          |          |          |\r\n  |  Name.   |          |          +----------+          |\r\n  +----------+----------+----------+  Family  +----------+\r\n  |          |          |          |  Name.   |          |\r\n  | Species. | Species. | Species. +----------+ Species. |\r\n  |          |          |          | Generic  |          |\r\n  +----------+----------+----------+  Name.   +----------+\r\n  |          |          |          +----------+          |\r\n  |          | Generic  |          |          |          |\r\n  | Species. |  Name.   | Species. | Species. | Species. |\r\n  |          |          |          |          |          |\r\n  +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |          |          |          |          | Generic  |\r\n  | Species. | Species. | Species. | Species. |  Name.   |\r\n  |          |          |          |          |          |\r\n  +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |          |          | Generic  |          |          |\r\n  | Species. | Species. |  Name.   | Species. | Species. |\r\n  |          |          |          |          |          |\r\n  +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |          |          |          |          |          |\r\n  | Species. | Species. | Species. | Species. | Species. |\r\n  |          |          |          |          |          |\r\n  +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nOn the lid, or on a slip of paper or card placed at the head of your\r\ncolumns of trays, write the class and order, with its proper number\r\n(I., II., etc., as the case may be); then at the top of your left-hand\r\ncolumn place the family and its number, and under it the name of the\r\nfirst genus.

He will\r\nalso find it very convenient to separate the British Shells from his\r\ngeneral collection, sub-dividing them for convenience into \"Land and\r\nFresh-water,\" and \"Marine.\" Of these he should endeavour to get every\r\nspecies, and even variety, making the thing as complete as possible.\r\nOr a separate collection may be made of all those kinds which he can\r\nfind within a certain distance of his own home. A collection of this\r\nsort possesses, in addition to its scientific worth, an interest of\r\nits own, owing to the local associations that invariably connect\r\nthemselves with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT GENERA, SHOWING THE APPROXIMATE\r\nNUMBER OF SPECIES BELONGING TO EACH GENUS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--CEPHALOPODA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ORDER I.--Dibranchiata.\r\n\r\n  Section A.--_Octopoda._\r\n\r\n  Family.

B. WOODWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology is of all \"hobbies\" the one best calculated not only to develop\r\nthe physical powers, but also, if pursued with any degree of\r\nearnestness, to train and extend the mental faculties. To study geology\r\nproperly, the rocks themselves must be visited and carefully observed,\r\ntheir appearance noted, and the fossils, if any, which they contain,\r\ncollected. This necessitates many a pleasant walk into the open country\r\nto quarries and cuttings, or rambles along the sea-shore to cliffs which\r\nmay be worth investigating, whilst botany, entomology, or any other\r\ncongenial pursuit, may be followed on the way; for natural science in\r\nits different branches has so many points of connection that it is\r\nimpossible to study one of them without increasing one's interest in,\r\nand knowledge of, all the others. Again, in arranging, classifying, and\r\nstudying at home the specimens collected on these expeditions, many an\r\nhour may be usefully spent; habits of exactitude and neatness are\r\nacquired; whilst in endeavouring to draw correct conclusions as to the\r\nway in which particular rocks were formed, and by what agencies brought\r\nto their present position, the reasoning faculties are exercised and\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe existence of fossil shells and bones in various strata of the\r\nearth's crust attracted attention at a very early date of the world's\r\nhistory; the Egyptian priests were aware of the existence of marine\r\nshells in the hills bounding the Nile valley, and from this fact\r\nHerodotus drew the conclusion that the sea formerly covered the spot.\r\nThe bones of the larger mammalia (rhinoceros, elephant, etc.), were,\r\nhowever, thought by the ancients to be human, and hence arose the idea\r\nof a race of giants having existed at some previous period of the\r\nearth's history. It was not, however, until near the end of the last\r\ncentury that geology began to be recognised as a science, and the true\r\nbearing of fossils in relation to the rocks in which they were found was\r\nconclusively proved. William Smith in England, and Werner in Germany,\r\nwhile working independently of each other, both came to the same\r\nconclusion, viz. that the numerous strata invariably rested on each\r\nother in a certain order, and that this order was never inverted,[1]\r\nwhilst William Smith in addition proved that each group of rocks, and\r\neven each stratum, had its own peculiar set of fossils, by which it\r\nmight be recognised wherever it occurred. From that time forth the study\r\nof the various fossils began to be considered as a separate science\r\napart from that of the beds containing them; this is now known as\r\nPalaeontology, the study of the composition of the rocks themselves being\r\ntermed Petrology.\r\n\r\n   [1] Except in such cases where the rocks themselves have been\r\n       displaced by movements of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, we are less concerned with the study of rocks\r\nand fossils than with the best and simplest way of collecting,\r\npreparing, and arranging specimens as a means to this study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cabinet for such specimens as you are able to\r\ncollect, the same advice holds good as that given in a previous Manual\r\n(The Young Collector's Shell Book), namely, the simpler the cabinet the\r\nbetter, though of course card-board boxes would not as a rule be strong\r\nenough to stand the weight of the specimens, and hence it is advisable\r\nto have wooden ones. The boxes in which Oakey's Wellington Knife-powder\r\nis sent out (they measure about 15 in. x 10 in. x 3 in.) are on the\r\nwhole the most convenient size, and are easily obtainable at any oil and\r\ncolourman's. These, when painted over with Berlin Black, after first\r\nremoving the external labels, look very neat. The inside may be papered\r\naccording to taste, when the trays may be arranged in order ready for\r\nthe reception of your specimens.[2]\r\n\r\n   [2] For description of trays, see \"The Young Collector's Shell-Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPLEMENTS REQUIRED WHEN COLLECTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain amount of apparatus is needful in collecting geological\r\nspecimens. It is necessary to break open the hard rocks in order to get\r\nat the fossils within, and for this purpose a strong hammer is required.\r\nOne end of the hammer-head should be square, tapering, slightly, to a\r\nflat striking face; for when thus shaped the edges and corners are less\r\nlikely to break off; the other side should be produced into a rather\r\nlong, flat, and slightly curved pick, terminating in a chisel-edge at\r\nright-angles to the handle; the total length of the head should not\r\nexceed 91/2 in., the striking face being 3 in. from the centre of the eye\r\nin which the handle (18 in. long) is inserted; the latter should be made\r\nof the toughest ash, American hickory, or \"green-heart,\" and fixed in\r\nwith an iron wedge (\"roughed\" to prevent its coming out again), taking\r\ncare that 1/4 in. of the handle protrudes on the other side. It is the\r\nusual practice, but a mistaken one, to cut it off level with the hammer\r\nhead, which is likely, under these circumstances, to come off after it\r\nhas been in use for a time, whereas, by leaving a small portion of the\r\nwedged-out end projecting, this mischance is avoided, and your weapon\r\nwill not fail even when used to drag its owner up a stiff ascent. It is\r\nbetter to shape and fix the handle yourself, as by this means you can\r\nnot only cut it to fit your hand, but may rely upon its being properly\r\nfastened in. By filing grooves around it an inch apart, it will serve to\r\ntake rough measurements with, while a firm grasp may be insured by\r\nbees-waxing instead of polishing it. Another and much smaller hammer\r\nwill also be necessary, chiefly for home use, to trim the specimens\r\nbefore putting them away in the cabinet; the head of this hammer must\r\nnot be more than 21/2 inches long, the handle springing from the centre;\r\none end has a flat striking face, square in section, the other, instead\r\nof being formed like a pick, is wedge-shaped, the sharp edge being at\r\nright-angles to the handle. Next to a hammer, a cold chisel is\r\nindispensable to the collector, since without its aid many a choice\r\nspecimen embedded in the middle of a mass of rock too large to break\r\nwith the hammer would have to be left behind. There is one thing,\r\nhowever, to beware of in using this tool--it has sometimes to be hit\r\nwith great force, and should you chance to miss it and strike your hand\r\ninstead, the result may be more serious than even a severe bruise. To\r\nprevent this, procure from the shoemaker or saddler a piece of thick\r\nleather, about 4 inches in diameter, having a hole cut in the centre\r\nthrough which to pass the shank of the chisel, and, thus protected, you\r\nmay wield the hammer with impunity.\r\n\r\nFor digging fossils out of clay, an old, stout knife, such as the\r\nworn-down stump of a carver, is handy, and in sandy beds an ordinary\r\ngarden trowel is very useful, whilst in a chalk-pit a small saw is\r\nsometimes of great aid in extricating a desirable specimen. The same may\r\nbe said of an ordinary carpenter's wood-chisel. For picking up small and\r\ndelicate specimens, a pair of forceps should be carried, whilst without\r\na pocket lens no true naturalist ever stirs abroad. An ordinary stout\r\ncanvas satchel, such as is commonly used by schoolboys, is the best\r\nthing for carrying home your specimens; this may be made much stronger\r\nby the addition of two short strips of leather stitched on the back and\r\nrunning, one from each ring, to which the strap passing over the\r\nshoulder is fastened, down to the bottom of the bag; by leaving a small\r\nportion unstitched near the bottom of each of these, wide enough for the\r\nshoulder-strap to pass through, the satchel may at a moment's notice be\r\nslung knapsackwise on the shoulders--a method of carrying it which is,\r\nas all who have tried it know, by far the most convenient when it is\r\nheavily laden or not in immediate requisition. A stout leather belt may\r\nbe worn in which to carry all your hammers, supporting it on the side\r\nwhere the heavy hammer hangs by a band passing over the opposite\r\nshoulder. Before starting on an excursion, make a practice of seeing\r\nthat you have everything with you, or when the critical moment comes,\r\nand some choice and fragile specimen is ready to be borne off, you may\r\nfind that you are without the means necessary for taking it home. For\r\nordinary hard specimens, newspaper well crumpled around them is without\r\nits equal, but some of the more delicate must be first wrapped in tissue\r\npaper or even cotton-wool, whilst the most fragile fossils should be\r\npacked in tins with bran or sawdust, the particles of which fill in all\r\nthe corners and press equally everywhere, a useful faculty which cotton\r\nwool does not possess. When neither of these are to be obtained, dry\r\nsand will answer quite as well, though it is heavier to carry.\r\n\r\nAlthough not absolutely necessary in the field, it is often useful to\r\nhave a small bottle of acid in your pocket (nitric acid diluted to\r\n1-12th with distilled water is the best) with which to test for\r\nlimestones; a drop of acid placed on a rock will, if there be any\r\ncarbonate of lime in it, immediately begin to fizz. Finally, every young\r\ncollector should carry a note-book, and carefully record in it what he\r\nsees in each pit he visits, while, if it can be procured or borrowed, a\r\ngeological map of the district you are exploring is a great help, for\r\nwith its aid and that of a good compass you become practically\r\nindependent of much extraneous assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE YOUR IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will suppose by way of illustration that near us flows a river, on\r\nthe rising ground above which is a pit that we propose to visit for the\r\npurpose of putting our apparatus into practical operation. When we have\r\nreached the floor of the pit, and stand looking up at the section before\r\nus, we are at first rather puzzled as to what the beds, which we see\r\nbefore us, are; for as the pit has not been worked for some time, its\r\nsides are partially overgrown with grass, and in places bits and pieces\r\nof the upper beds have fallen down and form a heap beneath which the\r\nlower ones lie buried. We must therefore make our way to those spots\r\nwhere the beds are left clear, and find out, if possible, what they are.\r\nBy climbing up one of the heaps of fallen earth (_talus_) we reach the\r\ntop, where, first of all, under the roots of the grass and shrubs, we\r\nfind the mould in which these grow, and which is formed of the broken up\r\n(_disintegrated_) rocks forming the still higher ground above, and which\r\nthe rains, frosts and snows, aided afterwards by the earthworms, have\r\nconverted into mould. This, geologically speaking, is called _surface\r\nsoil_, and is here about two feet deep. Just below it we find a layer of\r\ncoarse gravel; the pebbles of which this is composed are of all sorts,\r\nsizes, and shapes, and are stained a deep brown by oxide of iron. Most\r\nof them are flints, and by diligent search you may find casts and\r\nimpressions in these of sponges, shells, spines of sea urchins, etc.\r\nFlints, whether from gravel or their parent rock the chalk, are easiest\r\nbroken by a light smart tap of the hammer, though when it is desired to\r\nshape them for the cabinet a soft iron hammer should be used, and the\r\npiece to be shaped placed on a soft pad on the knee, for when struck\r\nwith a steel hammer flints splinter in all directions, and often through\r\nthe very portion you most desire to preserve. In one spot we find a mass\r\nof sand included in the gravel; this mass is thickest in the middle, and\r\ntapers away towards each end, its total length being about fifty feet.\r\nCould we see the whole mass, we should probably find it to be a patch\r\nlying on the gravel and thinning out all around its edges; in other\r\nwords it would be shaped like a lens--\"_lenticular_\" as geologists term\r\nit. When we examine this mass more closely, we find that the layers of\r\nsand do not run parallel with the bed, but are inclined in different\r\ndirections, sometimes lying one way, sometimes another. This _false\r\nbedding_ is due to the sand having been thrown down in waters agitated\r\nby strong currents that swept over the spot, now in one direction and\r\nnow in another, scattering at one moment half the sand they had just\r\npiled up one way only to redeposit it the next minute in another. In the\r\ngravel also may be observed a similar though less marked arrangement,\r\nowing to the larger size of its constituents, which of course required a\r\nstill stronger current action to wash them down.\r\n\r\nAmongst the sand we now see some shells, and set to work to dig them out\r\nvery carefully, for they are exceedingly brittle. The best specimens are\r\nto be obtained by throwing down masses of the sandy material and\r\nsearching in it; but only the stronger and finer examples will bear such\r\nusage. We next notice that these shells are precisely similar to those\r\nstill found with living occupants in the river below, only they are no\r\nlonger of a brownish colour, but owing to the loss of the animal matter\r\nof the shell have an earthy, dirty-white appearance. To carry these home\r\nthey should be packed in bran in one of your tins with a note as follows\r\nmade on a piece of paper and placed just inside--\"Sand in gravel:\r\ntopmost bed ---- pit, August 2nd, 188-.\" Then if you are not able to\r\nwork them out at once on reaching home, you will not forget whence they\r\ncame. From the appearance of these sands and gravels, and the presence\r\nin them of shells exactly like those in the river below, it may\r\nreasonably be inferred that they once formed a portion of the bed of\r\nthat river long ago, before it had scooped out its valley to the present\r\ndepth. There is, however, something else in this sand-bed--a piece of\r\nbone protruding; clear away the sand above it, and dig back until the\r\nwhole is visible. It is broken through in one or two places, but\r\notherwise is in fair condition; remove the pieces carefully one by one,\r\nand wrap them in separate pieces of paper, and then proceed to search\r\nfor others. These bones, which are plentiful in some of our river valley\r\ngravel-beds, are the remains of animals that once roamed in the forests\r\nwhich at that time covered the country; they were probably either\r\ndrowned in crossing the water, or got stuck in the mud on the banks on\r\ncoming down to drink. A fine collection was made at Ilford by the late\r\nSir Antonio Brady, and is now in the British Museum (Natural History) at\r\nSouth Kensington. Besides the bones of animals, you may expect to find\r\nexamples of all, or nearly all, the different rocks in which the river\r\nhas cut its valley, and samples of these may be picked out and taken\r\nhome. Each specimen should be wrapped in a separate piece of paper to\r\nprevent its rubbing against others, care being taken to note the\r\nlocality either by writing it on the paper or by affixing to the\r\nspecimen a number corresponding to one in your note book against the\r\ndescription you have written of the bed. The gravel, with its\r\naccompanying bed of sand, may be traced down, by scraping away the\r\nsurface, for about ten feet, when you will discover that it rests\r\nunevenly upon the beds below, which, instead of being horizontal, slope\r\n(_dip_) in a N.N.E. direction, making an angle of about 45 deg. with the\r\nfloor of the pit; the gravel therefore rests successively upon the\r\nupturned ends of the lower beds, and, geologically speaking, is\r\n\"unconformable\" to them. Now as these underlying rocks were of course\r\noriginally deposited in an horizontal position, they must have been\r\npushed up and the upper parts worn away (_denuded_) before the gravel\r\nwas deposited on them, for the accomplishment of which process an amount\r\nof time must have elapsed that it would be impossible to reckon by\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to examine these lower beds, we find first a stratum of\r\nstiff dark-brown clay containing fossils disposed in layers: those near\r\nthe outer surface have been rendered so brittle by the weather, that it\r\nis necessary to make use of the pick end of the hammer and dig a little\r\nway into the face of the section before we come upon some which will\r\nbear removal by cutting them out with a knife. Pack them in a tin with\r\nbran, or, where much clay still adheres to them, wrap them in paper.\r\n\r\nThe true top of this bed is not visible, being concealed beneath a heap\r\nof earth in the corner of the pit, but we can see and measure about six\r\nfeet of it.\r\n\r\nThe next bed in order is a light brownish band of sandy clay that\r\nsplits along its layers into thin pieces or \"_laminae_,\" whence we may\r\ndescribe it as a sandy, _laminated_ clay. On the freshly split surface\r\nof one piece we see scattered a number of small darker brown\r\nfragments; an examination with a pocket lens clearly shows that these\r\nare little bits of leaves and stems, with here and there a more\r\nperfect specimen. These beds must have been deposited in the still\r\nwaters just off the main stream of a large river which brought the\r\nplants floating down to this spot, where they became water-logged and\r\nsunk; so, too, if you examine the shells in the bed immediately above,\r\nyou will see that they are very like though not the same as those\r\nwhich at the present day love to dwell in the mud off the estuaries of\r\nbig rivers in warmer parts of the globe; hence we discover that at\r\nsome far distant period a big river, but one which had no connection\r\nwith that running close by, once flowed over this very spot. On\r\ntracing the leaf-bed down, we come all at once, at about three feet\r\nfrom its upper surface, upon a narrow band one or two inches thick of\r\na substance composed of numerous bits of sticks and stalks closely\r\nmatted together and partially mineralized. Vegetable matter in this\r\nform is known as lignite, and is one of the first stages towards the\r\nformation of coal out of plant remains. Below this lignite band we\r\nfind our leaf-bed getting sandier and sandier, and losing all trace of\r\nthe plants by degrees till it becomes almost pure sand. Here and\r\nthere, however, it contains some curiously shaped masses, which, when\r\nbroken through with the hammer, seem composed of nothing but the same\r\ngrains of sand cemented together into a hard mass. In one there is,\r\nhowever, a curiously shaped hollow, which, upon examining it closely,\r\nyou will see is a perfect cast of a small shell that has itself\r\ndisappeared. A drop of acid on it fizzes away and sinks in between the\r\ngrains of sand which in this spot become loose. A mass of sand or\r\nparticles of clay thus cemented together, be it by iron, lime, or any\r\nother substance, is termed a \"_nodule_\" or \"_concretion_,\" and in this\r\nparticular instance has been formed as follows:--The rain-water\r\nfalling on the sand where it comes to the surface sinks in and filters\r\nthrough the bed. Now there is always a certain amount of carbonic acid\r\nin rain-water, and this acid acted on the carbonate of lime of which\r\nthe shell was composed, dissolving and dispersing it amongst the\r\nneighbouring grains of sand where it was re-deposited, cementing them\r\ntogether as we have seen. The bottom of this bed of sand we find to be\r\njust fifteen feet from the lignite band when measured at right-angles\r\nto the bed, and it is succeeded by a hard greyish rock, which requires\r\na smart blow of the hammer to break it, but the surface of which,\r\nwhere it has been exposed to the weather, is much crumbled\r\n(\"_weathered_\"), and breaks readily into small pieces. It is easily\r\nscratched with the point of a knife, and therefore is not flint;\r\nmoreover, it fizzes strongly when touched with acid--hence there is a\r\ngreat deal of carbonate of lime in it, and we know that it is\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nLimestones are very largely, sometimes almost entirely, made up of the\r\ncalcareous portions of marine creatures, such as the hard parts of\r\ncorals, the tests of sea-urchins, the shells of mollusca, etc.,\r\nwelded, so to speak, into one mass by the heat, pressure, and chemical\r\nchanges which the bed has undergone since its deposition at the bottom\r\nof the sea. There would be every reason, therefore, one might suppose,\r\nto expect a number of fossils in this bed; but, alas! disappointment\r\nawaits the young explorer, for with the exception of chalk and a few\r\nother limestones, these rocks are generally of such uniform texture\r\nthat on being struck with the hammer they split through fossils and\r\nall, the fractured surface only too frequently showing nought save a\r\nfew obscure markings. But what we fail to accomplish in our\r\nimpatience, nature effects by slow degrees, and if you will turn over\r\nthe weathered pieces and blocks lying about, you will soon find plenty\r\nof fossils sticking out all over them; by a judicious use of hammer\r\nand chisel any of these may be detached and added to your stock, each\r\nbeing separately packed in paper and the locality written on the\r\noutside. Some seventy or eighty feet is all that is visible of this\r\nlimestone; the rest is unexcavated.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the pit, it will be as well to select such rock\r\nspecimens as you wish to place in your cabinet, trimming them to the\r\nrequired size on the spot, for should you, as is not unlikely, spoil\r\ntwo or three, you can readily pick a fresh one. Having secured our\r\nspecimens, we will take a look at our note-book, to see if we have\r\nnoted all the details we require. If so, our entries should run\r\nsomething as follows:--First, we have made a rough sketch of the\r\nposition of the beds, carefully numbering each one; then follow our\r\nnotes on the individual beds, preceded by numbers corresponding with\r\nthose in the sketch, thus:--\r\n\r\n  1. Surface Soil                                                  2 ft.\r\n  2. River Gravel, including a lenticular mass of               }\r\n  3.

Stiff dark-brown clay, with estuarine shells            6 ft. seen.\r\n  5. Light-brown sandy clay, with leaves and stems of plants       3 ft.\r\n  6.

Pure Sand, with layers of concretions containing casts     }\r\n     of shells                                                  } 15 ft.\r\n  9. Dark-Grey Limestone, with numerous fossils             80 ft. seen.\r\n\r\n  Beds 4 to 9 dip at an angle of 45 deg. to the N.N.E.\r\n\r\nOur imaginary pit is of course only a sort of geological Juan Fernandez,\r\nbut it will serve in some degree to illustrate the method of dealing\r\nwith various rocks and fossils when met with in the field, and how they\r\nmay best be collected and carried home. A few additional suggestions\r\nwhere to look for fossils may, however, be given here. To begin with, I\r\nnever neglect to search the fallen masses, especially their weathered\r\nsurfaces, or to look carefully over the heaps of quarried materials,\r\nwhatever they may happen to be, piled on the floor of the pit. In\r\nworking at the beds themselves, remember that fossils frequently occur\r\nin layers which of course represent the old sea-bottom of the period; to\r\nfind these, it is necessary to follow the beds in a direction at right\r\nangles to their stratification, till you arrive at the sought-for\r\nlayers, or _zones_.\r\n\r\nDo not be surprised, when collecting from a formation you have never\r\nbefore studied, if the fossils are not at first apparent, though many\r\nare known to be present. The eye requires a few days in which to become\r\naccustomed to its fresh surroundings, and when the same spot has been\r\ncarefully hunted over every day for a week, it is astonishing what a\r\nquantity of fossils are discernible where not one in the first instance\r\nwas recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO PREPARE THE SPECIMENS FOR THE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done on unpacking our specimens is to pick out\r\nthose which require the least attention, and get them out of the way.\r\nThese will be your rock specimens, which, if they have been trimmed\r\nproperly in the pit, will not need much further manipulation; a word or\r\ntwo, however, as to the best method of proceeding when it is desirable\r\nto reduce a specimen, will not be out of place. If you wish to divide it\r\nin two, or detach any considerable portion, the specimen may, while held\r\nin the hand, be struck a smart blow with the hammer; as, however, it not\r\nfrequently happens that even with the greatest care the specimen under\r\nthis treatment breaks in an opposite direction to that required, it is\r\nadvisable to adopt a somewhat surer method, namely, to procure a block\r\nof tough wood, and in the centre bore a hole just large enough to\r\nreceive the shank of the cold chisel, and thus hold it in an upright\r\nposition with the cutting edge uppermost; placing the specimen on this,\r\nand then hitting it immediately above with the hammer, it may be\r\nfractured through in any required direction. To trim off a small\r\nprojection, hold the specimen in your hand with the corner towards you\r\nand directed slightly downwards, then with the edge of the striking face\r\nof the hammer hit it a smart blow at the line along which you wish it to\r\nbreak off; the object of inclining the specimen is to make sure that the\r\nblow shall fall in a direction inclined away from the portion you wish\r\nto preserve, a _modus operandi_ which it is necessary to bear well in\r\nmind if you would not spoil many a choice specimen. Anything beyond very\r\ngeneral directions, however, it is impossible to give in such matters as\r\nthis: experience, and a few hints from those who have themselves had\r\npractice in collecting and arranging specimens, are worth more than any\r\nwritten description, however lengthy and elaborate.\r\n\r\nHaving reduced your specimen to the required size and shape, the next\r\nthing to be done is to write a neat little label for it--the smaller the\r\nbetter--stating, first the nature of the specimen, secondly the\r\ngeological formation to which it belongs, thirdly the locality from\r\nwhich it was procured, and fourthly the date when acquired, thus--\r\n\r\n  Limestone.\r\n  Lower Carboniferous.\r\n  Quarry, 1 mile N.W. of ----\r\n             21. 8. 8-.\r\n\r\nruling a neat line at the top and bottom (red ink lines give a more\r\nfinished appearance than black). When the label is dry, damp it to\r\nrender it more pliant, and gum it on to the flattest available surface\r\nof the specimen, pressing it well into any small inequalities that it\r\nmay hold the firmer. A small quantity of pure glycerine (about an eighth\r\npart) should be added to the gum before use, in order to prevent its\r\ndrying hard and brittle. The specimen is now ready to place in its tray\r\nand be put away in the cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, pick out the fossils which you obtained from the\r\nlimestone. With the cold chisel set in its block of wood, and the\r\ntrimming hammer, remove as much of the surrounding rock (_matrix_) as\r\nyou can without damaging the fossil, and with a smaller chisel any\r\npieces that may be sticking to and obscuring it. Fossils in soft\r\nlimestone, such as chalk, are best cleaned with an old penknife, and\r\nneedles fixed into wooden handles, and finished off by the application\r\nof water with a nail-brush. Should you have the misfortune to break any\r\nspecimen in the process of trimming, it should at once be mended. The\r\nmost effectual cement for this purpose is made by simply dissolving\r\nisinglass in acetic acid, or, where the specimen contains much iron\r\npyrites, and there would be a danger in starting decomposition, shellac\r\ndissolved in spirits of wine. When, however, neither of these are handy,\r\nchalk scraped with a penknife into a powder, and mixed with gum to the\r\nconsistency of a thick paste, answers admirably. Failing this, however,\r\ngum alone will frequently suffice.\r\n\r\nThe next thing is to place the like kinds together in their several\r\ntrays, writing a label, as before, for each tray, but leaving a blank\r\nspace at the top for the insertion of the name when ascertained. The\r\ncommoner sorts may be named from the figures of them given in the\r\ntext-books (see list at the back of the title page); but failing this,\r\nit will be the best plan to seek the help of any friends who have\r\ncollections, or to take the fossils to some museum, and compare them\r\nwith the named specimens there exhibited. The label may be laid at the\r\nbottom of the tray with the fossils loose on the top of it, each fossil\r\nbeing marked with a number corresponding to one on the label. Another\r\nplan is to fasten the label by one of its edges to the side of the tray;\r\nor, if the fossils are small and mounted on a piece of card fitting into\r\nthe tray, it may be gummed with them to the card.\r\n\r\nNow let us take the shells we obtained from the dark-blue clay, with\r\nthose and the bones from the old river bed up above. Gently turn them\r\nout of the tins, in which they were packed in the quarry, on to a paper\r\nor the lid of a card-board box, and with a pair of forceps pick them\r\ncarefully out of the bran, and place them in large shallow trays, taking\r\ncare not to mix those from the different beds. As we found when\r\ncollecting them, these shells are extremely brittle from loss of animal\r\nmatter, and our first object is therefore to harden them by some\r\nprocess, so that they will bear handling. To accomplish this you must\r\nget a saucepan, one of those wire contrivances for holding eggs when\r\nboiling, or a big wire spoon, such as formerly was used for cooking\r\npurposes, a packet of gelatine, and some flat pieces of tin, which last\r\nare easily procured by hammering out an old mustard or other tin, having\r\npreviously melted in a gas flame the solder wherewith it is joined. Half\r\nfill the saucepan with clean water, and put in as much gelatine as when\r\ncold will make a stiff jelly; melt this over the fire, placing the\r\nfossils meanwhile in a warm (not hot) corner of the fire-place; then\r\nwhen the gelatine is quite dissolved, pile as many of them, whole or in\r\npieces, into the egg-boiler, or spoon, as it will contain, hold them for\r\na second in the steam, and then lower them gradually into the hot\r\ngelatine until it completely covers them. Little bubbles of air will\r\nrise and float on the surface. As soon as these cease to appear, raise\r\nthe fossils above the surface and allow them to drip; then pick them up\r\none by one with the forceps, and spread them out on pieces of tin before\r\nthe fire, but not too close to it. As soon as their exterior surfaces\r\nbecome dry, and before the gelatine gets hard, they should be taken up\r\n(they may be handled fearlessly now), and the superfluous gelatine\r\nsticking to the surface gently removed with a camel's-hair brush dipped\r\nin clean warm water; otherwise, when dry, they present an unnatural\r\nvarnished appearance, and have a tendency, on small provocation, to\r\nbecome unpleasantly sticky.\r\n\r\nSmall bones may be treated in like manner, but for large ones, weak glue\r\nis to be preferred to gelatine, which is only suitable for the finer and\r\nmore delicate objects. Where it is desired to harden only a few things,\r\nit is better to mix the gelatine in a gallipot, which can be heated when\r\nrequired by standing it in a saucepan of water on the fire. In any case\r\nthe gelatine need never be wasted, as it will keep almost any length of\r\ntime, and can therefore be put by for future use. In default of the\r\negg-boiler or wire-net spoon, an equally useful plan is to make a\r\nstrainer from a piece of perforated zinc by turning up the edges all\r\naround, and attaching copper wire to it by which to lower the fossils\r\ninto the gelatine, and raise them again.\r\n\r\nWhen the fossils are quite dry they can be sorted, and those which have\r\ncome to pieces may be mended with diamond cement (_i.e._ isinglass\r\ndissolved in acetic acid), and then properly labelled and placed in\r\ntrays, or mounted as previously described.\r\n\r\nTo the plant remains and Lignite there is little that can be done beyond\r\ntrimming them to suit the trays. Should there be much iron pyrites in\r\nthe Lignite, it is sure, sooner or later, to decompose, when all that\r\ncan be done is to throw it away. In the case, however, of valuable\r\nfruits and seeds, such as those from the London Clay of Sheppey, it is\r\nworth while to preserve them, if possible, in almost the only way known,\r\nviz. by keeping them in glycerine in wide-mouthed stoppered bottles, or\r\nby saturating them with paraffin.\r\n\r\nHaving prepared the specimens for the cabinet, the next thing is to\r\narrange them in proper order. There are several ways of doing this, but\r\nfor those who have not had much experience the following plan will be\r\nfound the best:--Group the specimens according to the formations to\r\nwhich they belong, and arrange these groups in proper sequence (_vide_\r\nTable, p. 16); then take each group, and arrange the specimens it\r\ncomprises in columns. Beginning at the top of the left-hand corner,\r\nplace first the specimens of the rock itself, and under it any examples\r\nof minerals, concretions, etc., found in that rock; next the fossil\r\nplants, if any; and finally, such animal remains as you have arranged\r\naccording to their zoological sequence, beginning with the lower forms\r\n(_vide_ Table, p. 32). Unless cramped for room, each formation should\r\nbegin a new box, its name being written on a slip of paper and placed at\r\nthe head of the columns of trays. A label setting forth its contents\r\nshould be fixed outside each of the boxes, which can then be put away on\r\nyour cupboard shelves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF THE PRINCIPAL FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA ARRANGED IN CHRONOLOGICAL\r\nORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _Land Plants._-----------+\r\n                                                _Invertebrata._--------+ |\r\n                                                _Fishes._------------+ | |\r\n                                                _Amphibia._--------+ | | |\r\n                                                _Reptiles._------+ | | | |\r\n                                                _Birds._-------+ | | | | |\r\n                                                _Mammalia._--+ | | | | | |\r\n                                                _Man._-----+ | | | | | | |\r\n                                                           | | | | | | | |\r\n                                                           | | | | | | | |\r\n                                     {Alluvial Deposits,   | | | | | | | |\r\n  _Quaternary,                       {  River Valley       | | | | | | | |\r\n       or                            {  Gravels and        | | | | | | | |\r\n  Pleistocene._                      {  Cave Deposits.     | | | | | | | |\r\n                                     {Drift and Glacial    | | | | | | | |\r\n                                     {  Deposits.

Including the raised\r\nbeaches around the coast, the older gravels of river valleys and the\r\ncave deposits, in all of which the shells are identical with those\r\nliving in the rivers and seas of to-day, whilst the animals are many of\r\nthem extinct, only a few being now found living on the spot.\r\n\r\n2. The glacial drifts that cover all England north of the Thames, and\r\nwhich consist of sands, gravels, and clays, full of big angular stones\r\nfrequently flattened on one side, scratched and sometimes polished from\r\nhaving been fixed in moving ice and forced over other rocks. A very\r\ninteresting collection of these \"boulders,\" as they are called, can be\r\neasily made, for they belong to almost every formation in England, and\r\nhave some of them been brought from great distances, whilst the number\r\nand variety obtainable from a single pit is astonishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAINOZOIC, or TERTIARY.--Beds of this age, in England at all events, are\r\nfor the most part made up of comparatively soft rocks, gravels, sands,\r\nand clays, and are found in the eastern and south-eastern counties. They\r\nare divided into--\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Pliocene, mainly consisting of a series of iron-stained sands, with\r\nabundant shell remains, and locally known as \"crags.\" The shells are\r\nvery partial in their distribution, the beds in places being almost\r\nentirely made up of them, whilst in others scarcely one is to be found.\r\nThe great majority are of the same species as many still living. The\r\nPliocene is subdivided into three groups:--\r\n\r\n_a._ The _Norwich Crag Series_, sometimes called the \"Mammaliferous\r\nCrag,\" as at its base the bones of mastodon, elephant, hippopotamus,\r\nrhinoceros, and some deer have been found. The shells in it are such as\r\nstill abound on the beaches of the eastern coast to-day--whelks, scallop\r\nshells, cockles, periwinkles, etc.\r\n\r\n_b._ The _Red_ or _Suffolk Crag_, its two names indicating its\r\ncharacteristic colour (a dark red-brown) and chief locality. From\r\nthe base are obtained the celebrated phosphatic nodules miscalled\r\n\"Coprolites,\" whence is manufactured an artificial manure, and with them\r\nare found the rolled and phosphatized bones and teeth of whales, sharks,\r\netc. Amongst the shells the Reversed Whelks (_Fusus contrarius_),\r\n_Fecten opercularis_, _Pectunculus glycimeris_, several kinds of\r\n_Mactra_ and _Cardium_, etc., are the commonest. Walton-on-the-Naze,\r\nFelixstowe, and Woodbridge are the best known localities.\r\n\r\n_c._ The _White_ or _Coralline Crag_ is generally of a pale buff colour,\r\nand is in places almost entirely composed of the remains of Polyzoa.\r\nThese (formerly called Corallines, whence the name Coralline Crag) are\r\nbeautiful objects for a low-power microscope, or pocket lens, and are\r\neasily mounted in deep cells on slides. The bits of shell and sand that\r\nstick to them should be carefully removed with the point of a needle. A\r\nvery large number of shells occur in this crag: of bivalves, the\r\n_Pecten_ is very abundant, and its valves are frequently thickly grown\r\nover with Polyzoa; _Cyprina Islandica_, _Cardita Senilis_ are also\r\nplentiful; and of univalves, the genus _Natica_ is common. The Coralline\r\nCrag is best seen in the neighbourhood of Aldborough, Orford,\r\nWoodbridge, and other places in Suffolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Miocene, possibly represented in the British Isles by a small patch\r\nof clays and lignites at Bovey Tracey.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Eocene, divided into--\r\n\r\n_a._ _Upper Eocene_, consisting of a series of very fossiliferous sands,\r\nclays, and limestones, exposed in the cliffs at the eastern and western\r\nends of the Isle of Wight and on the neighbouring coast of Hampshire.\r\nThey are partly of freshwater origin, when they contain the remains of\r\nfreshwater shells such as _Limnoea Paludina_, _Planorbis_, etc.;\r\npartly of marine origin, when shells belonging to such genera as\r\n_Ostrea_, _Venus_, etc., take their place; partly of estuarine, when the\r\nbrackish water mollusca are found with bones and scutes of crocodiles\r\nand tortoises.\r\n\r\n_b._ _Middle Eocene_, or the _Bagshot Beds_, composed of sands and\r\nclays. The beautiful coloured sands of Alum Bay, the sands of the Surrey\r\nand Hampstead Heaths, are familiar examples of the beds of this age.\r\nVery few fossils indeed have been found in them. The clay-beds on the\r\ncontrary as seen at Barton and Hordwell on the Hampshire coast and again\r\nin the Isle of Wight, abound with shells belonging to genera such as\r\n_Conus_, _Voluta_ and _Venus_, that inhabit warm seas. With them are the\r\nNummulites, looking externally very like buttons, but on the inside\r\ndivided into innumerable chambers in which the complex animal that\r\nformed the nummulite dwelt.\r\n\r\n_c._ _Lower Eocene_, the well-known London clay, may almost be said to\r\ncompose this division, for the underlying sands, gravels, and clays are\r\nin mass comparatively insignificant. The London clay contains plenty of\r\nfossils, only as they are disposed in layers (_zones_) at a considerable\r\ndistance apart, they are not often hit upon. Layers of Septaria or\r\ncement-stones are of frequent occurrence. Sheppy is the great locality\r\nfor London clay fossils, as the sea annually washes down large masses of\r\nthe cliffs and breaks them up on the beach. A great many fossil fruits\r\nand seeds, remains of crabs, shells of Nautili, Volutes, and other\r\nmollusca, besides turtles, a species of snake, a bird with teeth, and a\r\ntapir-like animal, have at different times and in various places been\r\nfound in this deposit, which sometimes attains a thickness of over 400\r\nft. The \"Bognor Rock\" is a local variety of the basement bed of this\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Aturia Zic-zac_ (from the London clay).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MESOZOIC or SECONDARY rocks embrace a series of limestone, clays,\r\nsands, and sandstones that on the whole are well consolidated. The main\r\nmass of them lies to the west of a line drawn across the map of England\r\nfrom the mouth of the Tyne, in Northumberland, southwards to Nottingham,\r\nand thence to the mouth of the Teign in Devonshire. In the south-eastern\r\ncounties they underlie the tertiary rocks of the London and Hampshire\r\nbasins, as they are called, at no great depth from the surface. Outlying\r\npatches of secondary rocks occur in Scotland, where they are found near\r\nBrora on the east coast, and in the islands of Skye and Mull on the\r\nwest. In Ireland they are scantily represented round about the\r\nneighbourhood of Antrim. The secondary rocks are divided into--\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n_a._ The _Chalk_ is too well known to need description, though\r\ntechnically it may be described as a soft white limestone chiefly built\r\nup of the microscopic shells of _Foraminifera_, and characterized in its\r\nupper part by nodules and bands of flint. These flints frequently\r\ninclose casts of fossils (sponges, sea-urchins, etc.), and sometimes\r\nshells themselves. Fossils, too, are fairly abundant, scattered\r\nthroughout the mass. Amongst the commoner may be noticed the\r\nsea-urchins, such as the \"sugar loaf\" (_Ananchytes_) and the\r\nheart-shaped _Micraster_, the Brachiopods or Lamp-shells (_Terebratula_,\r\n_Rhynchonella_), a \"Thorny Oyster\" (_Spondylus spinosus_), besides\r\nAmmonites, Belemnites (part of the internal shell of a kind of\r\ncuttle-fish), and the teeth of several species of sharks. Altogether the\r\nchalk is about 1,000 feet thick.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Ammonites various_ (from the chalk).]\r\n\r\n_b._ _Upper Greensand_ is a series of greenish-grey sands and\r\nsandstones. The green colour, on close inspection, is seen to be due to\r\nthe presence of innumerable small green grains of a mineral called\r\nglauconite. These are frequently casts of the chambers of the very same\r\nforaminifera that the chalk is so largely composed of.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Rhynchonella depressa_ (a Brachiopod, from the Upper\r\n  Greensand).]\r\n\r\nNodules and layers of \"chert\" (an impure kind of flint) occur in it,\r\nwhilst in places it forms a hard rock called \"firestone.\" The commonest\r\nfossils are Brachiopods, very similar to those in the chalk, a\r\nscallop-shell with four strongly marked ribs on it (_Pecten\r\nquodricostatus_), an oyster with a curved beak (_Exogyra columba_), and\r\na pear-shaped sponge (_Siphonia pyriformis_). The Upper Greensand is\r\nbetter seen at places in the southern part of the Isle of Wight, in\r\ncliffs on the Dorsetshire coast, in Wiltshire, at Sidmouth, and in some\r\nparts of Surrey.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Ammonites auritus_ (from the Gault).]\r\n\r\n_c._ _Gault_, a stiff blue clay abounding in fossils: Ammonites often\r\nretaining their pearly shell; Belemnites, a bivalve with very deep\r\nfurrows on it (_Inoccramus sulcatus_), and its first cousin (_I.\r\nconcentricus_, p. 21), in which the ridge-like markings correspond with\r\nthe lines of growth, besides many others, may be obtained in abundance\r\nfrom it. Layers of phosphatic nodules occur at irregular intervals. The\r\ngault is best studied at East Wear Bay, near Folkstone; it may also be\r\nseen in Dorsetshire, Wiltshire, and Cambridgeshire; lately it has been\r\nfound as far west as Exeter.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Neocomian.\r\n\r\n_a._ The so-called _Lower Green Sand_, named in contradistinction to the\r\n_Upper Green Sand_, includes a series of iron stained sands, sandstones\r\nand clays of great thickness. The clayey beds are seen at Atherfield in\r\nthe Isle of Wight, and at Nutfield in Surrey, while the sandy beds are\r\nmet with at Speeton, at Folkestone, and near Reigate. Besides\r\nbrachiopods and oysters, these beds have furnished a species of _Perna_\r\n(_P. Mulleti_), an elongated mussel (_Gervillia anceps_), a pretty\r\n_Trigonia_ (_T. cordata_), some _Ammonites_ and Nautili, with the teeth\r\nand bones of big reptiles. The celebrated \"Kentish Rag\" and the sponge\r\ngravels of Farringdon are of this age.\r\n\r\n_b._ _Wealden._ The main mass of these rocks occupies the area inclosed\r\nbetween the North and South Downs, and forms the Valley of the Weald,\r\nwhence they take their name. They consist of a series of sands,\r\nsandstones, clays, and shelly limestones that were deposited in the\r\ndelta and off the mouth of a big river. The shells in them belong to\r\nfreshwater genera, _Cyrena_, _Unio_, _Paludina_, etc. Bones of a huge\r\nlizard that hopped along on his hind legs (_Iguanodon_), and those of\r\ncrocodiles, etc., are from time to time brought to light. The Wealden\r\nrocks occur also on both eastern and western sides of the Isle of Wight,\r\nand in Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Inoceramus concentricus_ (from the Gault).]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Oolites (or Roe-stones) are so named because the characteristic\r\nlimestones of this formation resemble very much the roe of a fish. The\r\nsmall round grains, of which the typical examples are built up, when cut\r\nor broken through will be seen to be formed of numerous layers of\r\ncarbonate of lime, disposed like the coats of an onion, around some\r\ncentral nucleus, generally a grain of sand, a fragment of coral, or the\r\nshell of one of the Foraminifera. They are divided into Upper, Middle,\r\nand Lower Oolites, and these again are subdivided as follows--\r\n\r\nUpper Oolite.\r\n\r\n_a._ _Purbeck Beds_, a series of fresh-water, with a few estuarine, or\r\nmarine beds, which in point of fact connect the deposits we are next\r\ncoming to with the Wealden just passed. They contain numerous\r\nfresh-water shells--_Paludina_, _Physa_, _Limnaea_, etc., with the\r\nmicroscopic valves of the little fresh-water crustacean _Cypris_, whose\r\ndescendants are abundant in the rivers and lakes of to-day. An oyster\r\noccurs in the \"Cinder Bed\" and Plant remains in the \"Dirt Beds.\" But the\r\nPurbecks are best known for the numerous remains of small mammals\r\n(_Plagiaulax_) allied to the kangaroo rat, at present living in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n_b._ The _Portland Stone and Sand_, which come next in order, are\r\nlargely quarried in the island whence they take their name. The\r\nquarrymen point out fossils in the stone, which they call\r\n\"Horses'-heads\" and \"Portland screws.\" The former is the cast of a\r\n_Trigonia_ shell; the latter, that of a tall spired univalve\r\n(_Cerithium_).\r\n\r\nIn Wiltshire, a coral (_Isastrea oblonga_) is found in the sandy beds,\r\nthe original calcareous matter of which has been replaced by silex.\r\n\r\n_c._ _Kimmeridge Clay._ This, by the pressure of the rocks subsequently\r\ndeposited on it, has in greater part been hardened, and possesses a\r\ntendency to split in thin layers, and hence is termed by geologists a\r\nshale. It is seen at various points between Kimmeridge on the\r\nDorsetshire coast and the Vale of Pickering in Yorkshire, and forms\r\nbroad valleys. The principal fossils in it are Ammonites, a\r\ntriangular-shaped oyster (_Ostrea deltoidea_), and one resembling a\r\ncomma (_Exogyra virgula_).\r\n\r\nMiddle Oolites.\r\n\r\n_a._ The _Coral Rag_, or _Coralline Oolite_, comprises a most variable\r\nset of beds, but principally a series of limestone, with fossil corals\r\nstill in the position in which they grew, and resembling in form the\r\nreef-building corals of the Pacific. They rest on\r\n\r\n_b._ _Oxford Clay_, a dark blue or slate-coloured clay without any\r\ncorals, but containing a great many _Ammonites_ and _Belemnites_. The\r\n_Kelloway Rock_, a sandy limestone at the base of the Oxford Clay, is\r\nwell developed in Yorkshire, and furnishes amongst other fossils a large\r\nbelemnite and an oyster (_Gryphaea dilatata_).\r\n\r\nLower Oolites.\r\n\r\n_a._ _Cornbrash_, a very shelly deposit of pale-coloured earthy, and\r\nrubbly or sometimes compact limestone with plenty of fossils. The\r\ncommonest are Brachiopods, Limas, oysters (_Ostrea Marshii_),\r\nPholadomyas and Ammonites. It is best seen in Dorsetshire,\r\nSomersetshire, and near Scarborough in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n_b._ _Forest Marble_ and _Bradford Clay_. The former is an exceedingly\r\nshelly limestone, often splitting into thin slabs. On the surfaces of\r\nsome of the beds may be seen the ripple marks the sea made countless\r\nyears ago, and the tracks of worms and crabs that dwelt in the mud or\r\ncrawled on its surface at a time when it was soft mud. The Bradford clay\r\nis a very local deposit, taking its name from Bradford in Wiltshire,\r\nwhere it is most developed, and its characteristic fossil is the\r\npear-shaped Encrinite or \"stone-lily\" (_Apiocrinus Parkinsoni_).\r\n\r\n_c._ The _Great_ or _Bath Oolite_, comprising a series of shelly\r\nlimestones and fine Oolites, or freestones. The latter are largely\r\nquarried in the neighbourhood of Bath, and used for mantelpieces and the\r\nstone facings of windows. The great Oolite is rich in univalve mollusca,\r\namongst which may be noted a limpet (_Patella rugosa_) and the handsome,\r\ntall-spired _Nerinaea Voltzii_, numerous bivalves belonging to the genera\r\n_Pholadomya Trigonia_, _Ostrea_ (_O. gregaria_), and _Pecten_, besides\r\nBrachiopods (_Terebratula digona_, which looks very like a sack of\r\nflour, and _T. perovalis_, etc.).\r\n\r\nAt the base of the Great Oolite are the \"Stonesfield slates,\"\r\nso-called--a series of thin shelly Oolites, etc., that split readily\r\ninto very thin slabs. They are principally of interest to geologists on\r\naccount of the discovery in them of the remains of small insect-feeding\r\nand possibly pouched mammals. With these are associated the bones of\r\nthat big reptile the _Megalosaurus_; the flying lizards called\r\nPterodactyles; fish teeth and spines; lamp shells; oysters, a _Trigonia_\r\n(_T. impressa_); and the impressions of insects, including a butterfly,\r\nand of plants.\r\n\r\n_d._ _Fullers' Earth_, a clayey deposit occurring in the southwestern\r\nparts of England, but not in the north. It abounds with a small oyster\r\n(_O. acuminata_) and Brachiopods (e.g. _Terebratula ornithocephala_),\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_e._ _Inferior Oolite_ (including the Midford Sands). As these beds are\r\nfollowed across the country from the south-west of England to Yorkshire,\r\nthey are found to change greatly in character. Limestone and marine beds\r\nin the south are replaced by sandy and estuarine beds in the north.\r\nAmongst other fossils from beds of this age may be found several\r\nEchinoderms, a crinkly lamp shell (_Terebratula frimbriata_), and a\r\nspiny one (_Rhynchonella spinosa_), bivalves belonging to the Genera\r\n_Ostrea_, _Trigonia_, _Pholadomya_, etc., and some very handsome\r\nAmmonites (e.g. _A. Humphresianus_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Ichthyosaurus_, or Fish-lizard (from the Lias).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Plesiosaurus_ (from the Lias).]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Lias.\r\n\r\nThis for the most part consists of very regular alternations of\r\nargillaceous (clayey) limestone and clay, or shale. It is of great\r\nthickness, and hence for convenience has been divided into (a) _Upper\r\nLias_, (b) _Middle Lias_ or _Marl-stone_, and (c) _Lower Lias_. A large\r\nnumber of fossils are to be found in it. Lyme Regis and Whitby are\r\nperhaps the best known localities; the former, on account of the great\r\nnumber of specimens obtained of the huge fish-lizard (_Ichthyosaurus_,\r\np. 24), and long-necked _Plesiosaurus_ (p. 25), besides numberless fish;\r\nwhilst the latter is renowned for its jet (or fossilized wood) and its\r\n\"snake-stones\" (_Ammonites_), concerning which curious old stories are\r\ntold. _Ammonites_ are plentiful in the Lias, which has been subdivided\r\ninto zones, or layers, named after the ammonite occurring in greatest\r\nnumbers in that particular zone. There is one thin limestone band in the\r\nMarlstone composed entirely of the shells of _Ammonites planicostatus_.\r\nA curious kind of oyster (_Gryphaea incurva_), locally known as the\r\ndevil's toenail, a huge _Lima_ (_L. gigantea_), a magnificent Encrinite\r\n(_Extracrinus Briareus_), and numerous other fossils, are also to be\r\nobtained by patient search.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Belemnitas elongatus_(from the Lias).]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Rhaetic, Penarth Beds, or White Lias.\r\n\r\nThese beds are not of any considerable thickness, but are very\r\npersistent, and of great interest, inasmuch as they yield the remains of\r\nthe oldest known mammal (_Microlestes_), a small insect-feeder. They are\r\ncomposed of limestones, shales and marls (_i.e._ limey clays), and are\r\nbest studied in Somersetshire and Dorsetshire. The \"landscape marble\"\r\nbelongs to this formation, which also contains a bone bed, or thin layer\r\nmade up of the bones and teeth, etc., of fish. Shells are not numerous,\r\nthough the casts of one species (_Avicula contorta_) is plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Trias, or New Red Sandstone, a thick series of sandstones and marls,\r\nthe great mass of which forms the subsoil of the western midland\r\ncounties, Birmingham being nearly in the centre, thence they extend in\r\nthree directions, one branch passing towards the north-west, through\r\nCheshire, to the sea at Liverpool, reappearing on the coast line of\r\nLancashire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, where it also forms the Valley\r\nof the Eden. Another branch extends through Derby and York to South\r\nShields, whilst the third may be traced southwards in isolated patches\r\ndown into Devonshire.\r\n\r\nThere are scarcely any fossils in it, but in Worcestershire and\r\nWarwickshire the bivalve shell of a small crustacean (_Estheria minuta_)\r\noccurs in the upper beds; whilst now and again the teeth and bones of\r\nsome strange amphibians (_Labyrinthodon_), or the impressions of their\r\nfeet (_Cheirotherium_) where they crawled on the then soft mud of the\r\nforeshore, are found. The Trias is divided into Upper Trias or Keuper,\r\nand Lower Trias or Bunter. The middle beds (Muschelkalk), which are\r\nfound in Germany, where they contain plenty of fossils, are wanting in\r\nthis country. In the lower beds of the Keuper, layers of rock salt,\r\nsometimes of great thickness, occur, whilst casts (called pseudomorphs)\r\nof detached salt-crystals are found abundantly in the sandy marls.\r\nNorthwich, Nantwich, Droitwich, and several other towns in Cheshire and\r\nWorcestershire, are famed for their salt works, the salt being either\r\nmined or pumped up as brine from these beds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Ceratites nodosus_ (from the Muschelkalk).]\r\n\r\n\r\nPALAEOZOIC or PRIMARY.--Beds of this age generally possess a more\r\ncrystalline and slaty structure than any of those already mentioned, are\r\nusually more highly inclined and disturbed, and form for the most part\r\nmore elevated ground. They are the principal store-houses of our mineral\r\nwealth, containing as they do coal, iron, and other metals. The\r\nPalaeozoic rocks are found in England to the north and west of the\r\nsecondary series, beneath which they disappear when traced to the\r\nsouth-east. Wales, and the greater part of Scotland and Ireland, consist\r\nof beds of this age.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Permian. Under this term are included beds of red sandstones and\r\nmarls, closely resembling those of Trias, and like them containing but\r\nfew fossils, as well as a very fossiliferous limestone, known as the\r\nMagnesian Limestone, from the abundance of magnesia it contains. A\r\npretty polyzoan (_Fenestella retiformis_), a spiny brachiopod\r\n(_Productus horridus_), various genera of fish, chiefly found in a marl\r\nstate underlying the limestone, some Labyrinthodonts and plant remains,\r\nare the principal forms met with in this formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Carboniferous. This, from a commercial point of view, is the most\r\nimportant of all the formations, comprising as it does the coal-bearing\r\nstrata. It is subdivided into--\r\n\r\n_a._ _Coalmeasures_, a series of sandstones and shales with which are\r\ninterstratified the seams of coal, varying in thickness from six inches\r\nto as much in one instance as thirty feet.\r\n\r\nCoal is the carbonized remains of innumerable plants, chiefly ferns and\r\ngigantic clubmosses, that grew in swamps bordering on the sea-coast of\r\nthe period. Each coal seam is underlain by a bed of clay called\r\n\"under-clay,\" containing the roots of the plants that grew on it. Some\r\nof the best impressions of ferns, etc., are to be obtained in the shaley\r\nbeds forming the roof of the coal seam; many good specimens, however,\r\nare to be got by searching the refuse heap at the pit's mouth. Besides\r\nplants, the remains of fish are abundant in some of the beds of shale.\r\nAnd in Nova Scotia the bones of air-breathing reptiles and land snails\r\nhave been discovered. Cockroaches and other insects were also denizens\r\nof the carboniferous forests.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal coalfields:--\r\n\r\n  1. Northumberland and Durham coalfield.\r\n  2. South Lancashire coalfield.\r\n  3. Derbyshire coalfield.\r\n  4. Leicestershire and Staffordshire coalfields.\r\n  5. South Wales coalfield.\r\n  6. Bristol and Somerset coalfields.\r\n\r\n_b._ _Millstone grit_ or _Farewell-rock_. The former term explains\r\nitself, the latter designation has been applied to it in the southern\r\ndistricts, because when it is reached, then good-bye to all workable\r\ncoal-seams.\r\n\r\nIt consists of coarse sandstones, shales, and conglomerates with a few\r\nsmall seams of coal. Fossils are not very common in it.\r\n\r\n_c._ Yoredale Rocks, a series of flagstones, gritstones, limestones and\r\nshales, with seams of coal, occurring in the northern counties. It is\r\nunderlain by--\r\n\r\n_d._ _Carboniferous_ or _Mountain Limestone_, which in places is upwards\r\nof 1,000 feet thick, and full of fossils. The stems of encrinites, or\r\n\"stone-lilies,\" corals, brachiopods (_e.g._ _Productus_, _Orthis_,\r\netc.), and Mollusca, including some Cephalopods, like _Goniatites_ and\r\nthe straight Nautilus (_Orthoceras_), with fish teeth, etc., go to\r\ncompose this tough, bluish-grey limestone which is largely quarried for\r\nmarble mantlepieces, etc.\r\n\r\n_e._ The _Tuedian group_ in the north, and _Lower Limestone Shale_ in\r\nthe south, follow next, and consist of shales, sandstones, limestones,\r\nand conglomerates, varying greatly in different districts, and\r\ncontaining few fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Devonian or Old Red Sandstone. To this age are assigned a perplexing\r\nseries of strata, the principal members of which consist of (_a_) a\r\nthick limestone, well seen in the cliffs and marble quarries of south\r\nDevon, and full of fossil-corals (_e.g._ _Favosites polymorpha_ [or\r\n_cervicornis_]) Brachiopods, and Mollusca, etc.\r\n\r\n_b._ A series of sandstones, slates, and limestones in North Devon\r\ncontaining Trilobites (_Phacops_, _Bronteus_, etc.), Brachiopods, and\r\nother fossils.\r\n\r\n_c._ The _Old Red Sandstone_ of Wales, the North of England, and\r\nScotland, consisting of red and grey sandstone and marly beds, with\r\nremains of fish.\r\n\r\nThese fish, unlike most now living, were more or less covered with hard\r\nexternal plates, and possessed merely a cartilaginous skeleton. In one\r\nset of individuals, indeed (_Pterichthys_), the armour plates formed\r\nquite a little box. These creatures propelled themselves by means of two\r\narm-like flippers, rather than fins. They were but a few inches long,\r\nand appear pigmies in contrast to the strange half-lobster-like\r\ncrustacean, _Pterygotus_, that lived with them, and attained sometimes\r\nas much as five feet in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Silurian. Named by Sir Roderick Murchison after a tribe of Ancient\r\nBritons that dwelt in that part of Wales, where these rocks were first\r\nobserved. Some of Murchison's Lower Silurian beds were included by\r\nProfessor Sedgwick in his Cambrian, of which we shall have to speak\r\nnext; and as these two geologists never could agree on a divisional line\r\nbetween their respective formations, and since succeeding observers have\r\nfollowed sometimes one and sometimes the other method of classification,\r\nconsiderable confusion has resulted. Here, however, for several reasons,\r\nwe propose to follow Sedgwick's arrangement; and hence, under the term\r\nSilurian, retain only Murchison's Upper beds. They consist of a series\r\nof sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates, shales, limestones, etc.\r\n\r\nAmongst the more important fossils, which are very abundant in the\r\nlimestones, are various corals (_e.g._ the Chain-coral _Halysites_),\r\nStar-fish, Crinoids, Trilobites (_Phacops_, etc.), Polyzoa, Brachiopods\r\nand Mollusca, especially Cephalopoda (_Orthoceras_, _Nautilus_, etc.).\r\n\r\nThese rocks occur principally in the border land between England and\r\nWales, and the adjacent counties; but are also represented in\r\nWestmoreland, Scotland, and Ireland. Their principal subdivisions are\r\ngiven in the Table on p. 16.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Trilobite (_Asaphus candatus_), (from the Silurian).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Orthoceras subannulatum_ (from the Silurian).]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Cambrian. Under this term, derived from the old name for Wales, are\r\nincluded many sandstones, grits, slates and flags, with here and there a\r\nlimestone band. They form the greater part of the western counties of\r\nWales, where they rise to a considerable height above the sea level. The\r\nhighest hills of Westmoreland and more than half of Scotland are\r\ncomposed of beds of this age.\r\n\r\nThe fossils, save in the limestone bands, are not easy to find, but in\r\nplaces they are fairly abundant. Brachiopods are far more numerous than\r\nthe Mollusca properly so-called. Of these, the genus _Orthis_ was most\r\nabundant at about the close of this period. Certain beds of this age\r\nhave received the name of Lingula Flags, owing this prevalence in them\r\nof the curious Brachiopod _Lingula_ so like the species now living in\r\nsome of the warm seas of the tropics. The Trilobites included several\r\nforms, and one species (_Paradoxides Davidis_) attained the length of\r\nnearly two feet. A few star-fish, some Hydrozoans (_Graptolites_), and\r\nthe tubes and casts of Annelides and tracks of Trilobites, complete the\r\nlist of more remarkable fossils. The subdivisions of the Cambrian rocks\r\nwill be found in the table on p. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Pre-Cambrian.--Near St. David's Head and some other places in Wales,\r\nin Anglesea, Shropshire, etc., some yet older rocks have been found.\r\nThey are probably for the most part of volcanic origin, but they have\r\nbeen so much changed since they were first deposited, and as hitherto no\r\nfossils have been found in them, little is known concerning them.\r\n\r\nParts of the western coast of Northern Scotland and the Hebrides are\r\ncomposed of a crystalline rock called Gneiss, and supposed to be the\r\noldest member of the British strata. No fossils have been found in it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Skull of _Deinotherium giganteum_, a huge extinct\r\n  animal, related to the elephants (from the Miocene of Germany).]\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ROCKS. Although there are fortunately no volcanoes to disturb\r\nthe peace of our country at the present day, there is abundant evidence\r\nof their existence in the past. Not only are some of the beds,\r\nespecially those of Paleozoic age, composed of the dust and ashes thrown\r\nout of volcanoes, with here and there a lava flow now hardened into\r\nsolid rock, but the stumps of the volcanoes themselves are left to tell\r\nthe tale. The cones indeed are gone, carried off piecemeal by the rain\r\nand frosts, and other destructive agencies, in the course of countless\r\nages: not so the once fluid rock within; _that_ cooled down into\r\nGranite, and though originally below the surface, it now, owing to the\r\nremoval of the overlying softer strata, forms raised ground overlooking\r\nthe surrounding country. The granite masses of Cornwall, of Dartmoor, in\r\nthe south-west of Mt. Sorrel; the variety called Syenite at Malvern and\r\nCharnwood Forest; the Basalts of the Cheviot Hills and of Antrim; the\r\nvolcanic rocks of Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh, and of the islands of Skye\r\nand Mull, etc., are examples of this class of rock. They are of\r\ndifferent ages, and belong to different periods of the earth's history,\r\nfrom early Palaeozoic down to Miocene times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF THE PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM, TO SHOW THE\r\nORDER IN WHICH THE FOSSILS SHOULD BE ARRANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVERTEBRATA.\r\n\r\n _Foraminifera_, minute chambered shells like the Nummulite.\r\n\r\n _Spongida_, Sponges.\r\n\r\n _Hydrozoa_, Graptolites, etc.\r\n\r\n _Actinozoa_, Corals.\r\n\r\n _Echinodermata_, Sea-urchins, Stone-lilies, Starfish, etc.\r\n\r\n _Annelida_, Worm tracks.\r\n\r\n _Crustacea_, Trilobites, Crabs, etc.\r\n\r\n _Arachnida_, Scorpions and Spiders.\r\n\r\n _Myriapoda_, Centipedes.\r\n\r\n _Insecta_, Beetles, Butterflies, etc.\r\n\r\n _Polyzoa_ (_Bryozoa_) or Moss Animals.\r\n\r\n _Brachiopods_, Lampshells.\r\n\r\n              { _Lamellibranchiata_, Bivalves.\r\n _Mollusca_   { _Gasteropoda_, Univalves.\r\n              { _Cephalopoda_, Cuttlefish, Ammonites.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERTEBRATA.\r\n\r\n _Pisces_, Fish.\r\n\r\n _Amphibia_, Labyrinthodonts, Frogs, and Newts.\r\n\r\n _Reptilia_, Reptiles.\r\n\r\n _Aves_, Birds.\r\n\r\n _Mammalia_, Mammals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS OF REFERENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR NAMING COMMON FOSSILS.\r\n\r\n  =Tabular View of Characteristic British Fossils Stratigraphically\r\n  Arranged.=\r\n    By J.
