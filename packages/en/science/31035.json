The plain\r\ndrops 2000 feet in ten miles. On a clear evening, before the sun reaches\r\nthe horizon, the rays of the sun are reflected from great sandstone\r\ncliffs forming the walls of deep canyons that appear as crooked yellow\r\nlines in the distance. Canyon after canyon has cut into the sloping\r\ngreen plain. These canyons are roughly parallel and all open into the\r\ncanyon of the Mancos River, which forms the southern boundary of the\r\nMesa Verde. If the observer turns to the north he sees the arid\r\nMontezuma Valley 2000 feet below. A few green streaks and patches in the\r\nbrown and barren low country denote streams and irrigated areas. To the\r\nnortheast beyond the low country the towering peaks of the San Miguel\r\nand La Plata mountains rise more than 4000 feet above the vantage point\r\non the North Rim at 8000 feet. To the northwest, in the hazy distance 90\r\nmiles away in Utah, lie the isolated heights of the La Sal Mountains,\r\nand 70 miles away, the Abajo Mountains (see Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, harassed by nomadic tribes and beset by years\r\nof drouth, village dwelling Indians left their great cliff dwellings in\r\nthe myriad canyons of the Mesa Verde, and thus ended a period of 1300\r\nyears of occupancy. The story of those 1300 years, unfolded through\r\nexcavation and study of the dwellings along the cliffs and earlier\r\ndwellings on the top of the Mesa, is one of the most fascinating in\r\nancient America. To stop destructive commercial exploitation of the\r\nruins, to preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy, and\r\nto make them accessible to the public, more than 51,000 acres, including\r\napproximately half of the Mesa, have been set aside as Mesa Verde\r\nNational Park, established in 1906. The policies of the National Park\r\nService provide protection, not only for the features of major interest\r\nin each park, but for other features as well. Thus the policy in Mesa\r\nVerde National Park is not only to preserve the many ruins, but also the\r\nwildlife and plants.\r\n\r\nFive considerations prompted me to undertake a study of the mammals of\r\nMesa Verde National Park: First, the relative lack of disturbance;\r\nsecond, the interesting position, zoogeographically, of the Mesa that\r\nextends as a spur of higher land from the mountains of southwestern\r\nColorado and that is almost surrounded by arid country typical of much\r\nof the Southwest; third, the discovery in the Park of _Microtus\r\nmexicanus_, a species of the Southwest until then not known from\r\nColorado; fourth, the co-operative spirit of the personnel at the Park\r\nwhen I visited there in 1955; and finally, the possibility of making a\r\ncontribution not only to our knowledge of mammals, but to the\r\ninterpretive program of the Park Service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of the \"four corners\" region showing the\r\nposition of Mesa Verde National Park (in black) relative to the mass of\r\nthe Southern Rocky Mountains above 8000 feet elevation (indicated by\r\nstippled border) to the northeast in Colorado, and the positions of\r\nother isolated mountains in the region.]\r\n\r\nA Faculty Research Grant from The University of Kansas provided some\r\nsecretarial help and field expenses for August and early September,\r\n1956, when my wife, Justine, and I spent our vacation enjoyably\r\ncollecting and studying animals in the Park. The co-operation of Dr. E.\r\nRaymond Hall is greatly appreciated; a grant to him from the American\r\nHeart Association provided field expenses for work by Mr. J.R. Alcorn,\r\ncollector for The University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, in\r\n1957.\r\n\r\nMr. Harold R. Shepherd of Mancos, Colorado (Senior Game Biologist for\r\nthe State of Colorado, Department of Game and Fish), provided advice in\r\nthe field, helped in identifying plants, and saved specimens of rodents\r\n(in 1958 and 1959) taken in his studies of the effect of rodents on\r\nbrowse utilized by deer. Mr. J.D. Hart, Assistant Director of the\r\nDepartment of Game and Fish, issued a letter of authority to collect in\r\nColorado; and Superintendent O.W. Carlson approved my appointment as a\r\ncollaborator. Mr. \"Don\" Watson, then Park Archeologist, and Mrs. Jean M.\r\nPinkley, now Park Archeologist, assisted us in 1956, and since then have\r\nprovided advice and assistance, and have reviewed the manuscript of this\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nGeologically, the Mesa Verde is the northern edge of a Cretaceous,\r\ncoal-bearing, sandstone deposit called the Mesaverde group, which dips\r\nbeneath the San Juan Basin of New Mexico. An abrupt retreating\r\nescarpment commonly forms on arid plateaus underlain by horizontal rocks\r\nof unequal strength, and characterizes the borders of mesas. Such an\r\nescarpment forms the North Rim of the Mesa Verde. However, the dip of\r\nthe rocks has channelled drainage southward and erosion has cut\r\nnumerous, deep, parallel-sided canyons rather than a simple, retreating\r\nescarpment. The Mesa Verde therefore is, technically speaking, a cuesta\r\nrather than a mesa. The remnants of the plateau left between the canyons\r\nare also (and again incorrectly in the technical sense) called mesas;\r\nChapin Mesa and Wetherill Mesa are examples.\r\n\r\nClimatically, the Mesa Verde is arid; precipitation averaged 18.41\r\ninches per year for a period of 37 years. Precipitation may be scattered\r\nthrough the year, and more important, may be erratic from month to month\r\nand from year to year. In addition to low precipitation and periods of\r\ndrouth, a great amount of sunshine, and thin, well-drained soils on all\r\nbut the more sheltered parts of the Mesa favor vegetation that requires\r\nneither great amounts of, nor a continuous supply of, water.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the Mesa is illustrated in Plates 1 and 2, and\r\nconsists predominantly of pinyon pine, _Pinus edulis_ Engelm., and Utah\r\njuniper, _Juniperus osteosperma_ (Torr.) Little. More sheltered areas\r\nalong the North Rim and in most of the canyons support scattered small\r\nstands of Douglas fir, _Pseudotsuga menziesii_ (Merb.) Franco. These\r\nare the \"spruce trees\" of Spruce Tree Canyon. An occasional ponderosa\r\npine, _Pinus ponderosa_ Laws., represents a vestige of more montane\r\nspecies of plants and animals in the Park. The dusky grouse,\r\n_Dendragapus obscurus_ (Say), occurs along the North Rim in\r\noak-chaparral, and is one of the few montane species of birds; several\r\nmontane mammals are discussed later. The vegetation of the Mesa Verde\r\nhas not changed appreciably in the last thousand years. The tree rings\r\nof 13 centuries show that Douglas fir has grown essentially as it does\r\nnow, varying with precipitation from year to year, and periodically\r\nsuffering from drouth (Schulman, 1946:18). Surface ruins yield mostly\r\npinyon and juniper; cave ruins yield more Douglas fir than surface\r\nruins; and \"only rarely does yellow pine [_Pinus ponderosa_] occur in\r\nthe ruins, indicating that then, as now, this tree grew only in the\r\nnorthern and higher parts of the Mesa Verde, remote from most of the\r\nruins\" (Getty, 1935:21).\r\n\r\nNot all areas within the Park are undisturbed. The rights of way of\r\nroads are kept clear, as are campgrounds and other facilities in the\r\narea of headquarters. Part of the Mancos Valley within the Park is\r\nprivately owned and is still in agricultural use. Cattle from land\r\nbelonging to the Ute Indians wander into the Park from the Mancos Canyon\r\nalong the floor of the canyon above the mouth of Weber Canyon. In\r\naddition to the pasture near headquarters, Prater Canyon below a fence\r\nacross the canyon above Middle Well is used to pasture horses used by\r\nvisitors to the Park and belonging to the pack and saddle concessioner.\r\nIn 1956, the floor of Long Canyon was grazed by stock belonging to Utes,\r\nand horses ranged freely onto Wetherill Mesa as far as the North Rim.\r\nOccasionally livestock enter the floor of other canyons, for example\r\nNavajo, Soda, Prater, Morfield, and Waters canyons, owing to inadequate\r\nfencing, or no fencing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Map of Mesa Verde National Park and vicinity. The\r\nmap and this legend provide the names of places mentioned in the\r\nfollowing accounts of mammals. Localities from which specimens have been\r\npreserved are indicated by dots. Localities within 1/2 mile of each\r\nother are not indicated by separate dots. Unnumbered dots designate some\r\nof the places from which specimens were obtained. The numbered dots are:\r\n(1) Prater Grade; (2) Upper Well, Prater Canyon, 7575 ft.; (3) Chickaree\r\nDraw, 8200 ft.; (4) 1/4 mi. N Middle Well, 7500 ft., Prater Canyon; (5)\r\neast side of Morfield Canyon about one mile below the well; (6) Lower\r\nWell, Prater Canyon; (7) Sect. 27, head of east fork Navajo Canyon; (8)\r\nFar View, designated on various specimens as Far View Ruins, Far View\r\nPoint, and Far View House, 7700 ft.; (9) localities designated Utility\r\nArea, and Well, \"Park Well,\" or \"Old Park Well\"; (10) Headquarters,\r\nincluding the designations 25 mi. [by road] SW Mancos, Museum, Hospital,\r\nhead of Spruce Tree Canyon, Spruce Tree House, and Spruce Tree Lodge;\r\n(11) Cliff Palace, across the canyon about 1/4 mile southwest are Sun\r\nTemple and Oak Tree Ruin; (12) Square Tower House; (13) Balcony House;\r\n(14) Indian Cornfield, \"Cornfield,\" or \"Garden.\"]\r\n\r\nThe first mammals from the Mesa to be preserved for scientific study\r\nwere seven specimens in the United States National Museum (designated\r\nUSNM in lists of specimens examined) obtained by Merritt Cary in 1907,\r\nand mentioned in his \"Biological Survey of Colorado\" (Cary, 1911). In\r\n1931 and 1932, R.L. Landberg obtained a few specimens that are in the\r\nDenver Museum of Natural History. In 1935, C.W. Quaintance, Lloyd White,\r\nHarold P. Pratt, and A.E. Borell prepared specimens, some of which\r\nremain in the museum at the Park (all specimens in the museum at the\r\nPark are designated by \"MV\" for Mesa Verde and by their catalogue\r\nnumbers), and some are in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the\r\nUniversity of California at Berkeley (designated \"MVZ\" in the following\r\naccounts). Specimens in The University of Kansas Museum of Natural\r\nHistory are referred to by catalogue numbers only. Specimens prepared by\r\nD. Watson bear dates from 1936 until 1955. In 1938, Raymond F. Harlow\r\nprepared some specimens; his Student Technician's Report of 7 typescript\r\npages, for July 8 to September 9, 1938, is on file at Mesa Verde\r\nNational Park. In 1944 and 1945, Dr. D.A. Sutton, then a student at the\r\nUniversity of Colorado, collected chipmunks for his own study, and also\r\nsome other specimens that are in the University of Colorado Museum and\r\nthe Park Museum. In 1949, Dr. R.B. Finley, then a student at The\r\nUniversity of Kansas, collected in and near the Park and obtained a few\r\nspecimens preserved in The University of Kansas Museum of Natural\r\nHistory. Rodents preserved by Harold R. Shepherd have been mentioned. I\r\nhave examined 244 specimens that were collected by the above persons.\r\nBetween August 8 and September 4, 1956, and on July 17, 1960, I\r\ncollected 216 mammals from Mesa Verde National Park. Between November 3,\r\nand 12, 1957, J.R. Alcorn collected 275 mammals from the Mesa. The total\r\nof specimens examined is 735.\r\n\r\nWritten reports by C.W. Quaintance, H.P. Pratt, and R. Harlow have been\r\nof considerable use. A typescript report of 13 pages by Wildlife\r\nTechnician H.P. Pratt for the period from September 9 to October 15,\r\n1935, and monthly reports comprising 40 typescript pages and 4 pages\r\nwith photographs by C.W. Quaintance for the period from February 18\r\nthrough July 17, 1935, are on file at offices of Region Four, National\r\nPark Service, 180 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco 5, California.\r\nChief Ranger Wade has kindly made available the files in his office,\r\nincluding reports of the Superintendent and reports of the Chief Ranger\r\nin earlier years, and Annual or Biennial Animal Census Reports since\r\n1930. Special reports on prairie dogs, porcupines, and deer are in the\r\nfiles. These reports, and random reports that were regarded as reliable,\r\nare recorded on card files in both the Chief Ranger's office and Park\r\nArcheologist's office. Most of the information reported here on the\r\nlarger mammals was gleaned from the above sources. A study of population\r\nfluctuations in porcupines by Donald A. Spencer and perhaps a study of\r\nmovements of porcupines by Spencer, Wade and Fitch are to be published\r\nelsewhere. Other studies still in progress are mentioned in the\r\nfollowing accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNTS OF SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nSorex merriami leucogenys Osgood Merriam's Shrew\r\n\r\n     _Specimen_: MV 7898/507, head of Navajo Canyon (locality No. 7 in\r\n     Fig. 2), October 21, 1954.\r\n\r\nThis was the third reported specimen of the rare Merriam's shrew from\r\nColorado (Rodeck and Anderson, 1956:436).\r\n\r\n\r\nSorex vagrans obscurus Merriam Wandering Shrew\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 8: Morfield Canyon, 7600 ft., 75972,\r\n     75973; Upper Well, Prater Canyon, 7575 ft., 69235-69238; 1/4 mi. N\r\n     Middle Well, Prater Canyon, 7500 ft., 69239-69240.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from Prater Canyon were trapped in the grasses and sedges\r\nof the meadow comprising the floor of the canyon. The ground and\r\nvegetation were dry at the time of capture, September 2, 3, and 4, 1956.\r\n_Microtus montanus_ was the only other species taken in the mouse traps\r\nin the sedge and grass. Five of the six specimens from Prater Canyon are\r\nyoung, having slightly worn teeth; the sixth is an old adult male the\r\nteeth of which are so much worn that only a few traces of the\r\nreddish-brown pigment remain. His testes were 5 mm. long. These\r\nspecimens are from an area of intergradation between _S. v. obscurus_\r\nand _S. v. monticola_. The length of the maxillary tooth-row in these\r\nsix specimens averaged 6.23 (6.1-6.4) millimeters. Comparison with\r\naverage measurements of 6.6 and 6.8 in samples of _S. v. obscurus_, and\r\nof 5.9 in a sample of _S. v. monticola_ (Findley, 1955:64, 65) reveals\r\nthe intermediate size of the specimens from the Mesa Verde. The gap\r\nbetween habitat suitable for _Sorex vagrans_ on the Mesa Verde and the\r\nnearest record-station for _S. v. monticola_ to the south and west in\r\nthe Chuska Mountains is wider than the gap between the Mesa Verde and\r\nthe nearest record-station for _S. v. obscurus_ to the north and east,\r\none mile west of Mancos, 75971, 7000 feet, or at Silverton. On\r\ngeographic grounds the specimens from the Mesa Verde are referred to _S.\r\nv. obscurus_. The two specimens from Morfield Canyon were trapped on\r\nNovember 4, 1957, and are grayish above and silvery below. Their pelage\r\ncontrasts markedly with the dorsally brownish and ventrally buffy pelage\r\nof the September-taken specimens from Prater Canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyotis californicus stephensi Dalquest California Myotis\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._---Total, 3: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69243,\r\n     69246, August 21 and 22, 1956; 4505 Denver Museum, within the Park\r\n     (exact locality not recorded), R.L. Landberg, July 27, 1931.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from Rock Springs were an adult male and a non-pregnant\r\nadult female. Both were shot over the road in pinyon and juniper. The\r\nspecimens are referred to _M. c. stephensi_ on account of their\r\npaleness, _stephensi_ being paler than _M. c. californicus_ from east of\r\nMesa Verde in Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyotis evotis evotis (H. Allen) Long-eared Myotis\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 4: Chickaree Draw, Prater Canyon,\r\n     8200 ft., MV 7841/507, probably in the summer of 1935; Rock\r\n     Springs, 7400 ft., 69241, August 23, 1956, and 69249, August 18,\r\n     1956; Museum, Headquarters, 6950 ft., 69251, August 24, 1956.\r\n\r\nAn adult male (69241) was taken in a Japanese mist net stretched fifteen\r\nfeet across a dirt road where it entered the stand of pinyon and juniper\r\nat the south edge of the burn on Wetherill Mesa between 7:20 and 8:30\r\np.m.; at the same place and time I captured five other bats of four\r\nspecies: _Myotis thysanodes_, _Myotis subulatus_, _Eptesicus fuscus_,\r\nand _Plecotus townsendii_. A piece of mist net attached to an aluminum\r\nhoop-net two and one half feet in diameter was used to good advantage in\r\ncapturing bats rebounding from the larger mist net, and in frightening\r\nbats into the larger net when they approached closely. An adult male\r\n(69249) was shot at 7:20 p.m. while flying six to eight feet from the\r\nground between pinyon trees up to 20 feet high; the air temperature was\r\n70° F. A female (69251) was found seemingly exhausted on the floor in\r\nthe museum at Park Headquarters in the daytime, and was immature as\r\nindicated by small size, open basicranial sutures, unworn teeth, weakly\r\nossified zygoma, and open epiphyseal sutures of phalanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyotis subulatus melanorhinus (Merriam) Small-footed Myotis\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 8: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69242,\r\n     69244, 69245, 69247, 69248, August 21 to 23, 1956; Hospital, Park\r\n     Headquarters, MV 7886/507, [Male], July 12, 1939; Headquarters,\r\n     MV 7877/507, [Female], August 30, 1938; 4504 Denver Museum,\r\n     within the Park (exact locality not recorded), R.L. Landberg, July\r\n     27, 1931.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from Rock Springs are two adult males that were shot, and\r\none adult male, one adult female, and one young male that were netted\r\nat the place described in the account of _Myotis evotis_. The three\r\nadult males are near the average color of _M. s. melanorhinus_, and\r\ndistinctly darker than the _Myotis californicus_ from the Mesa Verde. In\r\nthe female the pelage is paler and brighter, and the ears and membranes\r\nare darker, than in _M. californicus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyotis thysanodes thysanodes Miller Fringed Myotis\r\n\r\n     _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69250, ad. [Female], August\r\n     23, 1956; taken in net as noted in account of _Myotis evotis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyotis volans interior Miller Long-legged Myotis\r\n\r\n     _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69252, ad. [Female], August\r\n     21, 1956; shot over road.\r\n\r\n\r\nEptesicus fuscus pallidus Young Big Brown Bat\r\n\r\n     _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69253, ad. [Female], August\r\n     23, 1956; taken in net as noted in account of _Myotis evotis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlecotus townsendii pallescens (Miller) Townsend's Big-eared Bat\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 5: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69254, ad.\r\n     [Female], non-pregnant, August 23, 1956; Square Tower House,\r\n     6700 ft., 69255-69258, March, 1955.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from Rock Springs was taken in a net as noted in the\r\naccount of _Myotis evotis_. The specimens from Square Tower House were\r\nobtained by D. Watson in a dimly lighted chamber formed by fracture in\r\nthe rocks at the bottom of the canyon wall, above the talus slope. The\r\nbats were suspended from the wall of the chamber, which was at least six\r\nfeet wide and fifteen feet long.\r\n\r\n\r\nTadarida brasiliensis mexicana (Saussure) Brazilian Free-tailed Bat\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: Cliff Palace, 6800 ft., MV\r\n     7862/507 and 7863/507, males, both collected by A.E. Borell, on\r\n     August 23, 1936.\r\n\r\n\r\nLepus californicus texianus Waterhouse Black-tailed Jackrabbit\r\n\r\nThe black-tailed jackrabbit inhabits the Montezuma Valley to the north\r\nof the Mesa Verde and the Mancos Valley to the northeast, and has been\r\nseen occasionally on the top of the Mesa according to reports with date\r\nand locality noted in the files at the Park for the years 1941, 1942,\r\n1947, 1948, 1950, and 1951. In 1942 four observations were made, in 1950\r\nand 1951 two observations were recorded each year, and in other years\r\nonly one observation was recorded each year. Nine observations are for\r\nChapin Mesa south of Far View; only two observations are for higher\r\nelevations on the North Rim.\r\n\r\n\r\nSylvilagus audubonii warreni Nelson Desert Cottontail\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: Head of Prater Canyon, MV\r\n     7850/507; Far View Ruins, 75974, ad. [Female], non-pregnant,\r\n     November 8, 1957.\r\n\r\nOne specimen was shot, while it was sitting near a pile of logs, by J.R.\r\nAlcorn by means of a bow and arrow. Although _S. audubonii_ occurs on\r\nthe Mesa along with _S. nuttallii_, _S. audubonii_ is the species of the\r\nlowlands throughout the western United States at the latitude of Mesa\r\nVerde National Park. For example, _S. a. warreni_ (69260) but not _S. n.\r\npinetis_ was obtained along the east side of the Mancos River at 6200\r\nfeet elevation (less than 50 yards outside the Park) and the same was\r\ntrue at the same elevation at a place 4-1/2 mi. N of the Park (No. 69259\r\nfrom 2 mi. E Cortez).\r\n\r\n\r\nSylvilagus nuttallii pinetis (J.A. Allen) Nuttall's Cottontail\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: ad. [Male], 69263, skull only,\r\n     dead on road, 1-3/4 mi. N Park Headquarters, 7275 feet, August 9,\r\n     1956; ad. [Female], 69261, no embryos, dead on road, 3/4 mi. S\r\n     and 1-3/4 mi. W Park Point, 8000 ft, August 8, 1956; ad. [Male],\r\n     69262, shot in brushy area on the burn on Wetherill Mesa 2 mi. NNW\r\n     Rock Springs, 7900 ft., August 24, 1956.\r\n\r\nNuttall's cottontail in Colorado is in general the cottontail of the\r\nhighlands, and the three localities just mentioned are on the top of the\r\nMesa Verde.\r\n\r\n\r\nSciurus aberti mimus Merriam Abert's Squirrel\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: [Male], MV 7872/507, prepared\r\n     by D. Watson, killed by a car \"near\" the Park Well on September 24,\r\n     1937; [Female] (an unnumbered cased skin only), found dead\r\n     \"near\" the Park Well on June 21, 1937.\r\n\r\nSince 1934 these squirrels have been observed and recorded each year\r\nexcept in 1938, 1943, 1947, 1953, 1957, and 1958. The 77 reported\r\nobservations can be grouped as follows: 11 from within a mile of the\r\nentrance to the Park, 14 from the North Rim or higher parts of canyons\r\nadjacent to it, 38 from Chapin Mesa south of Far View, and 14 not\r\nclassifiable. The large number of observations on Chapin Mesa, chiefly\r\nin the vicinity of Park Headquarters, indicates the presence of more\r\nobservers rather than more squirrels in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\nTamiasciurus hudsonicus fremonti (Audubon and Bachman) Red Squirrel\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: MV 7843/507, Chickaree Draw,\r\n     Prater Canyon, 1935, C.W. Quaintance and Lloyd White; [Female],\r\n     69264, no embryos, 1/4 mi. NNW Middle Well, Prater Canyon, 7600\r\n     ft., August 31, 1956.\r\n\r\nRed squirrels, or chickarees as they are called in Colorado, are known\r\nfrom only one place on the Mesa Verde, a side canyon on the west side of\r\nPrater Canyon above Middle Well. This side canyon has been named\r\nChickaree Draw by C.W. Quaintance, who, with Lloyd White, studied the\r\nchickaree there in 1935. Quaintance reported the small colony at 7800\r\nfeet elevation in Douglas fir beneath which were found piles of cones\r\nfrom which the seeds had been eaten by the chickarees. On May 29, 1935,\r\nWhite observed a chickaree eating green oak leaves. On June 3, 1935, a\r\nnest was found in an old hollow snag up under the rim rock; there were\r\nfour young squirrels in the nest. At least one nest was in a juniper and\r\nwas composed mostly of oak leaves and grass. One nest twenty-five feet\r\nfrom the ground in a Douglas fir was composed of oak leaves and finely\r\nshredded cedar bark. In August, 1956, I found these squirrels in the\r\nsame area and I shot one specimen. Other chickarees were seen and heard\r\nand the characteristic piles of parts of Douglas fir cones still attest\r\nto their presence. On September 1, 1953, D. Watson observed a pair of\r\nchickarees in Prater Canyon. The only other specific record in the files\r\nat the Park is of two seen in a branch of Soda Canyon in late 1956. Jean\r\nPinkley tells me that chickarees have been observed in 1958 and 1959 at\r\nseveral other localities from Prater Canyon to the hill at the head of\r\nNavajo Canyon. The extent to which increased observations indicate an\r\nincrease in number of chickarees is uncertain, since the amounts of time\r\nspent in the field and the percentage of observations recorded are not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarmota flaviventris luteola A.H. Howell Yellow-bellied Marmot\r\n\r\nRecords are available of observations at 14 different places in the Park\r\nand in 19 different years between 1930 and 1960. Approximately\r\ntwo-thirds of the observations have been on Prater Grade or in upper\r\nPrater Canyon or in upper Morfield Canyon. On the morning of August 24,\r\n1956, Harold Shepherd and I heard the whistle of an animal that he was\r\ncertain was a marmot, 2 mi. NNW of Rock Springs at the west rim of\r\nWetherill Mesa. Mr. Shepherd has worked in areas occupied by marmots for\r\nyears in southwestern Colorado. Wetherill Mesa is the locality farthest\r\nwest in the Park where marmots are known to occur. They occur as far\r\nsouth as Cliff Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\nCynomys gunnisoni zuniensis Hollister Gunnison's Prairie Dog\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: MV 7836/507, Prater Canyon, 7600\r\n     ft., C.W. Quaintance and L. White, May 24, 1935; [Female], MV\r\n     7847/507, head of Prater Canyon, June 13, 1935, C.W. Quaintance\r\n     (the skin is on display); MV 7887/507, Prater Canyon, September 1,\r\n     1939.\r\n\r\nC.W. Quaintance in reports on the results of his work in 1935 included\r\nthe following information:\r\n\r\nOn February 20 in Prater Canyon Ranger Markley noticed that prairie dogs\r\nwere active although about three feet of snow lay on the ground. Between\r\nApril 15 and May 15 approximately 500 prairie dogs were in Prater Canyon\r\nabove Lower Well; through field glasses 350 were counted. Young were\r\nfirst noted in Prater Canyon on July 12. Quaintance and Lloyd White had\r\nunder observation two bulky nests of the red-tailed hawk in the tops of\r\ntall Douglas firs in side draws of Prater Canyon. Quaintance found near\r\nthe rimrock a quarter of a mile from the prairie-dog town the skeletons\r\nof two prairie dogs between a sliver of a dead pinyon branch and the\r\nbranch itself. Another skeleton lay on a dead limb fifteen feet from the\r\nground. A red-tailed hawk once was observed to swoop down, seize a\r\nprairie dog and fly down the canyon. The four colonies found in the Park\r\nwere in Prater Canyon, in Morfield Canyon, in the east fork of School\r\nSection Canyon, and in Whites Canyon. The last two were smaller colonies\r\nthan the first two.\r\n\r\nPrairie dogs were observed away from these colonies. On June 20 a young\r\nprairie dog ran into a culvert on the Knife Edge Section of the road.\r\nOthers were observed on the north side of the road, at the head of the\r\neast prong of School Section Canyon, on the road west of Park Point, and\r\non the road at the head of Long Canyon five miles from the nearest known\r\ncolony in the Park. Possibly this last individual came from the\r\nMontezuma Valley north of the Park. Mr. Prater, after whom Prater Canyon\r\nis named, homesteaded on the Mesa Verde in 1899. He informed Quaintance\r\nthat prairie dogs were present in Morfield Canyon prior to 1900 but were\r\nnot in Prater Canyon in 1899. Prater said he drowned out a few that came\r\ninto Prater Canyon before 1914. In 1942, Chief Ranger Faha wrote in his\r\nAnnual Animal Census Report that he had interviewed an old time resident\r\n(name not noted) who stated that prairie dogs were not present on the\r\nMesa Verde until about 1905 or 1906 and that Helen Morfield, the\r\ndaughter of Judge Morfield who homesteaded in Morfield Canyon, brought\r\nthe first prairie dogs on the Mesa Verde. Estimates of the prairie-dog\r\npopulation in the Annual Animal Census Reports for 1935 through 1941\r\nwere: 1935--800, 1936--650, 1937--650, 1938--650, 1939--no report,\r\n1940--1500 and increasing, 1941--slight decrease. After 1942 more\r\nadequate records were kept by Chief Ranger Wade and other Park Service\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\nOn August 9, 1943, occupied burrows of prairie dogs were found to be\r\nthinly scattered down Prater Canyon from the head of the canyon at the\r\nMaintenance Camp to a point about one hundred feet below the lower well.\r\nThe largest concentration was in the vicinity of the upper well near\r\nPrater's Cabin. Little new digging that would indicate a spreading\r\npopulation was noticed. Seemingly desirable, but unoccupied, habitat\r\nextended at least two miles south of the inhabited area. In Morfield\r\nCanyon, burrows were found from a point one hundred yards north of the\r\nfence at the south boundary of Section 17, south for a mile and one-half\r\nto a point one-third of a mile into Section 29. The greatest\r\nconcentration was in the vicinity of Morfield Well. South of this point\r\nthe burrows were found only along the narrow dry sides of the canyon and\r\nin sage-covered areas at slightly higher elevations than the rest of the\r\nfloor of the canyon. Seemingly desirable habitat extended at least three\r\nmiles to the south and one mile to the north of the occupied area. The\r\nreport of the study in 1943 concluded with the statement that artificial\r\ncontrol by poisoning would be unwise and unnecessary. Requests were\r\nbeing made at that time to exterminate prairie dogs in the Park on the\r\nbasis of the unproved assumption that prairie dogs move from the Park to\r\nsurrounding range land where extermination was then being attempted by\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 1944, no occupied burrows were found in Whites Canyon or\r\nthe east fork of School Section Canyon. A heavy rain on August 9 made\r\naccurate count of occupied burrows possible. In Prater Canyon the\r\noccupied area extended 200 feet south of the area occupied in 1943. In\r\nMorfield Canyon no change had occurred. North of the fence in Morfield\r\nCanyon 130 occupied burrows were counted. More than one hole, if judged\r\nto be part of the same burrow system, were counted as one. The\r\nvegetation within the colony had continued to improve in spite of the\r\nlarge population of prairie dogs.\r\n\r\nOn August 8 and 14, 1945, although a careful search was made, the only\r\nprairie dogs found in Prater Canyon were living in one burrow fifty\r\nyards from the Maintenance Camp. In Morfield Canyon the colony had\r\ndecreased. Occupied burrows were found on the west side of the canyon\r\nnear the fence and above the well (17 burrows), and below the well on\r\nthe west side (estimated 30 burrows). The total population in both\r\ncanyons was estimated to be 100, compared with 800 in the preceding\r\nyear. The ground-water table was thought to be rising, and vegetation\r\nwas increasing.\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1946, two prairie dogs were observed in Prater Canyon, one\r\nnear the Maintenance Camp, and the other a mile to the south. In\r\nMorfield Canyon 18 occupied burrows were found north of the fence and 36\r\nbelow the well, in the same two areas occupied in 1945.\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1947, two animals were seen at one of the localities\r\noccupied a year earlier in Prater Canyon, and three burrows were\r\noccupied. In Morfield Canyon 119 occupied burrows were counted. At least\r\n12 dens occupied by badgers were present in 1946, and four in 1947.\r\n\r\nOn August 9, 1948, no evidence of living prairie dogs was found in\r\nPrater Canyon. In Morfield Canyon 45 burrows were counted north of the\r\nfence. The grass had been increasing in abundance for several years.\r\n\r\nOn August 18, 1949, no evidence of living prairie dogs was found in\r\neither canyon. In 1951 five prairie dogs were said to have been seen in\r\nPrater Canyon in June and July. No other observations have been\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 1956, 13 pups and 7 adult prairie dogs were released in an\r\nenclosure in Morfield Canyon. Periodic inspections in the summer\r\nrevealed that the colony was surviving and healthy. By the following\r\nspring no prairie dogs remained. Another reintroduction is planned this\r\nyear (1960).\r\n\r\nBoth the history of the prairie dogs and the history of the viewpoint of\r\npeople toward them are interesting. Individual views have ranged from a\r\ndesire to exterminate all the prairie dogs to a desire to leave them\r\nundisturbed by man.\r\n\r\nIn review: The early history of prairie dogs on the Mesa Verde is not\r\nwell documented but reports are available of the absence of prairie dogs\r\nbefore settlement by white men, and of introductions of prairie dogs.\r\nOther reports indicate that prairie dogs have been observed far from\r\nestablished colonies; therefore natural invasion may account for the\r\nestablishment of prairie dogs on the Mesa. Grazing of moderate to heavy\r\nintensity by livestock continued in Morfield Canyon until 1941.\r\nCessation of grazing and above average precipitation were accompanied by\r\nincreased growth of vegetation in the colonies of prairie dogs. Mr. Wade\r\nhas suggested that flooding of burrows by ground water drove prairie\r\ndogs from some lower parts of the floors of the canyons, and that\r\nincreased vegetation favored predators, primarily badgers and coyotes,\r\nwhich further reduced the population. The abruptness of the decline,\r\nespecially in Prater Canyon, is consistent with the theory that some\r\nepidemic disease occurred. This possibility was considered at the time\r\nof the decline, and a Mobile Laboratory of the United States Public\r\nHealth Service spent from June 5 to June 25, 1947, in the Park\r\ncollecting rodents and their fleas for study. The primary concern was\r\nplague, which had been detected in neighboring states. No evidence of\r\nplague or of tularemia was reported after study of 494 small rodents\r\nobtained from 13 localities in the Park. Only six prairie dogs (all from\r\nMorfield Canyon) were studied. The negative report does not prove that\r\ntularemia or some other disease was not a factor in the decimation of\r\nthe colony in Prater Canyon the year before.\r\n\r\nIf prairie dogs were able to survive primarily because of over-grazing\r\nby domestic animals, future introductions may fail. If disease was the\r\nmajor factor in their disappearance, reintroductions may succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpermophilus lateralis lateralis (Say) Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 10: highway at School Section Canyon,\r\n     MV 7894/507; Sect. 27, head of east fork of Navajo Canyon, 7900\r\n     ft., 69265; and Prater Canyon, 7600 to 7800 ft., MV 7835/507,\r\n     7837/507, 7846/507, 7874/507, 7875/507, MVZ 74411-74413.\r\n\r\nIn 1956, I observed _S. lateralis_ 1/2 mi. W of Park Point, 3/4 mi. WSW\r\nPark Point, in the public campground at Park Headquarters, at the lower\r\nwell in Prater Canyon, and at two other places on the North Rim. Other\r\nobservations on file were made at Prater Grade, Park Point, \"D\" cut (on\r\nNorth Rim 1 mi. WSW Park Point), and Morfield Canyon. A juvenile was\r\nnoted at Park Point on June 28, 1952, by Jean Pinkley, and five young\r\nwere seen together at \"D\" cut on July 3, 1935. The earliest observation,\r\nalso recorded by Jean Pinkley, was on February 1, 1947. All of the\r\nlocalities with the exception of Park Headquarters are above 7500 feet,\r\nand most of the localities are in vegetation that is predominantly\r\noak-brush.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpermophilus variegatus grammurus (Say) Rock Squirrel\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 6: Head of Prater Canyon, MV\r\n     7876/507; Chickaree Draw, Prater Canyon, MV 7843/507, 7844/507;\r\n     Headquarters Area, MV 7888/507; Ruins Road 1/2 mi. NE of Cliff\r\n     Palace, MV 7893/507; and Spruce Tree House, 4334 in Denver Museum.\r\n\r\nSpecimen number 7893/507 had 360 Purshia seeds in its cheek-pouches\r\naccording to a note on the label. On July 18, 1960, I found a young male\r\nrock squirrel dead on the road a mile north of headquarters that had 234\r\npinyon seeds in its cheek-pouches. Young, recorded as \"half-grown,\" have\r\nbeen observed in May and July. The first appearance may be as early as\r\nJanuary. In 1950, D. Watson thought that they did not hibernate, except\r\nfor a few days when the weather was stormy. I observed a rock squirrel\r\nin August in the public campground at Park Headquarters sitting on its\r\nhaunches on a branch of a juniper some twelve feet from the ground and\r\neating an object held in its forefeet. The rock squirrel ranges\r\nthroughout the Park in all habitats.\r\n\r\n\r\nEutamias minimus operarius Merriam Least Chipmunk\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 17: North Rim above Morfield Canyon,\r\n     MV 7856/507; Morfield Canyon, 7600 ft. (obtained on Nov. 4, 1957),\r\n     75976; Middle Well in Prater Canyon, 7500 ft, MV 7855/507; Prater\r\n     Canyon, 7600 ft., MVZ 74414; Park Point, 8525 ft., 69267-69270; 1/4\r\n     mi.

N Rock Springs, 8200 ft., 69276-69277.\r\n\r\nFive of the fourteen specimens of known sex are females, all of which\r\nwere taken in August and September, and none of which is recorded as\r\nhaving contained embryos. The skulls of the eight August-taken specimens\r\nalso suggest that young are born in late spring or early summer: the\r\nlargest skull had well-worn teeth that might indicate an age of more\r\nthan one year; four others had complete adult dentitions that were\r\nbarely worn; and three had not yet acquired complete adult dentitions.\r\n\r\nThe records of _E. minimus_, like those of _Spermophilus lateralis_,\r\nindicate greatest abundance in the higher parts of the Mesa Verde and in\r\nareas of predominantly brushy vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEutamias quadrivittatus hopiensis Merriam Colorado Chipmunk\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 13: Prater Canyon, 7600 ft., MV\r\n     7838/507; Lower Well, Prater Canyon, 69278; Park Headquarters, MV\r\n     7889/507; near the old Park Well, 7300 ft., 5468 in Univ. of\r\n     Colorado collection; Utility Area, 5469 and 5470 in Univ. of\r\n     Colorado collection; Spruce Tree House, 4352-4355 in Denver Museum;\r\n     Mesa Verde, 25 mi. [by road] SW Mancos, 149080-149081 USNM; Square\r\n     Tower House, 7000 ft., 5467 in Univ. of Colorado collection.\r\n\r\nAlthough both species occur in some of the same areas, _E. q. hopiensis_\r\nis more abundant than is _E. minimus_ in stands of pinyon and juniper,\r\nalong cliffs, and at low elevations. (A specimen of _hopiensis_, MV\r\n7849/507, from 3 mi. S of the Park boundary where the 6000 foot contour\r\nline cross the Mancos River is indicative of the occurrence at low\r\nelevations.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThomomys bottae aureus J.A.

NNW Rock Springs, 69305; Mesa Verde, northern end,\r\n     8100 ft., 149087 USNM.\r\n\r\nThe pocket gophers of the Mesa Verde and vicinity are of one species,\r\n_Thomomys bottae_. The distribution and variation of this species in\r\nColorado have been studied recently by Youngman (1958) who referred all\r\nspecimens from the Mesa Verde to _T. b. aureus_. He noted that some\r\nspecimens have dark diffuse dorsal stripes that are wide in specimens\r\nfrom the Mancos River Valley. The generally darker color of the\r\nspecimens from the Mancos Valley as compared with that of specimens from\r\non the Mesa was noticed in the field, and is another example of the\r\nlocal variability of pocket gophers. The nine specimens listed by\r\nYoungman (1958:372) as from \"Mesa Verde National Park,\" Mancos River,\r\n6200 ft., are not here listed among \"specimens examined\" because\r\npossibly some, or all, of the nine were trapped on the east side of the\r\nRiver and therefore outside the Park. None was, however, farther than 30\r\nyards east of the Park.\r\n\r\nIn the Park, pocket gophers occur both on mesa tops and in canyons. Most\r\nof the localities listed above and others at which mounds were seen are\r\nareas of disturbance such as the old burn on Wetherill Mesa, the rights\r\nof way for roads, the river valley, and the grazed floor of Prater\r\nCanyon. Little evidence of pocket gophers was found on unusually rocky\r\nslopes, steep slopes, or in stands of pinyon and juniper or in\r\nrelatively pure stands of oak-brush. In addition to workability of the\r\nsoil, the presence of herbaceous plants, many of them weedy annuals, is\r\nprobably the most important factor governing the success of pocket\r\ngophers in a local area. No female was recorded to have contained\r\nembryos, but two had enlarged uteri or placental scars. This fact and\r\nthe capture of nine half-grown individuals indicate breeding prior to\r\nlate August when most specimens were trapped.\r\n\r\n\r\nDipodomys ordii longipes (Merriam) Ord's Kangaroo Rat\r\n\r\nKangaroo rats have been seen crossing the highway in the Park less than\r\none mile from the Park entrance by Jean Pinkley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCastor canadensis concisor Warren and Hall Beaver\r\n\r\nIn 1935 Quaintance and White spent June 16 to June 20 in the Mancos\r\nRiver Bottoms at the mouth of Weber Canyon, looking for sign of fresh\r\nbeaver work. They found none. Annual Animal Census Reports include the\r\nfollowing information based on patrols along the Mancos River at the\r\neast boundary of the Park: 1937--estimate 4 beaver present, 1938--8,\r\n1941--numerous bank burrows, 1942--uncommon, 1944--uncommon, 1945--most\r\nconcentrated at southeast corner, 1946--runs and two small dams seen\r\n(flood had washed out larger dams), 1947--only in 1-1/2 miles north of\r\nboundary with Ute Reservation, 1949--two separate colonies (each with\r\ndams and one with a large house), 1950--none, owing to drouth and\r\ndiversion of water upstream completely drying the river at times,\r\n1951--none, 1953--present, 1955--present. On the Mancos River, 6200 ft.,\r\nin late August, 1956, sign of beaver was abundant, numerous trees had\r\nbeen cut but none within a week, and a bank den was found on the west\r\nside of the river extending back 50 feet from the stream and caved in at\r\nthree places. In 1959 dens were still present.\r\n\r\n\r\nReithrodontomys megalotis aztecus J.A. Allen Western Harvest Mouse\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 38: North end Mesa Verde National\r\n     Park, 7000 ft, 75984-75986; Park Point, 8525 ft., 69316-69317; Far\r\n     View Ruins, 7700 ft, 69318-69319, 79220, MV 7897/507, and 23\r\n     uncatalogued specimens in preservative; 3 mi. N Rock Springs, 8200\r\n     ft., 69320-69321; 2 mi. NNW Rock Springs, 7900 ft., 69322-69323; 1\r\n     mi. NNW Rock Springs, 7600 ft., 69324; 1/2 mi. NNW Rock Springs,\r\n     7500 ft., 69325.\r\n\r\nThe specimen listed last (69325) was an adult male recovered from the\r\nstomach of a small (snout-vent length 334 mm., wt. 26.0 gms.) _Crotalus\r\nviridus_ that was trapped in a Museum Special mouse-trap on a rocky\r\nslope mostly barren of vegetation. The availability of samples taken in\r\nAugust (by Anderson in 1956), in September (by Shepherd in 1958), and in\r\nNovember (by Alcorn in 1957) makes the following comparison of age and\r\nreproductive condition possible. The sample from November includes some\r\nspecimens from outside the Park as follows: 1 mi. W Mancos, Colorado,\r\n75979-75983, and 2 mi. N La Plata [not shown on Fig. 2], San Juan\r\nCounty, New Mexico, some 18 miles southeast of the Park, 75987-76000.\r\nThe data shown in Figure 3 indicate that females are pregnant at least\r\nfrom in August into November. A smaller percentage of females was\r\npregnant in November than in August or September. The fact that all\r\nfemales more than 130 mm. long were pregnant in September suggests an\r\nautumnal peak in breeding activity. A change in the ratio of small\r\nindividuals (less than 130 mm. in length) to large individuals (130 mm.\r\nor more in length) is indicative of a sustained breeding period\r\nthroughout the time shown.

[by road] SW\r\n     Mancos, 149093 USNM; Cornfield, MV 7878/507.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant mammal is the ubiquitous deer mouse. Series of\r\nspecimens taken in August (by Anderson in 1956), in September (by\r\nShepherd in 1958 and 1959), and in November (by Alcorn in 1957) make\r\npossible the following comparisons of age, reproductive conditions, and\r\nmolts.\r\n\r\nThe specimens obtained in August and November were placed in five\r\ncategories according to age (as judged by wear on the teeth). These\r\ncategories correspond in general to those used by Hoffmeister (1951:1)\r\nin studies of _Peromyscus truei_. From his descriptions I judge that\r\nwear in _Peromyscus maniculatus_ differs from wear in _Peromyscus truei_\r\nin that the last upper molar is not worn smooth before appreciable wear\r\nappears on the first two molars, and the lingual and labial cusps wear\r\nmore nearly concurrently. The five categories differ as follows:\r\ncategory 1, last upper molar in process of erupting, showing no wear;\r\ncategory 2, some wear apparent on all teeth, but most cusps little worn;\r\ncategory 3, greater wear on all teeth, lingual cusps becoming rounded or\r\nflattened; category 4, lingual cusps worn smooth, labial cusps show\r\nconsiderable wear; category 5, all cusps worn smooth. The condition of\r\nthe pelage was noted for each prepared skin. Hoffmeister (_op. cit._: 4)\r\nsummarized changes in pelage that he observed in _Peromyscus truei_, and\r\nhe summarized earlier work by Collins with _Peromyscus maniculatus_. In\r\n_P. maniculatus_ a grayish juvenal pelage is replaced by a postjuvenal\r\npelage in which the hairs are longer and have longer, pale, terminal or\r\nsubterminal bands giving a paler and more buffy or ochraceous hue to the\r\ndorsal pelage. The postjuvenal pelage is replaced by an adult pelage\r\nthat is either brighter or, in some cases, is not distinguishable with\r\ncertainty from the postjuvenal pelage. Not only is the juvenal pelage\r\ndistinguishable from the postjuvenal pelage, but the sequence of\r\ningrowth of postjuvenal pelage follows a regular pattern that is usually\r\ndifferent from that of subsequent molts. The loss of juvenal hair is\r\nless readily observed than the ingrowth of new postjuvenal hair on\r\naccount of the greater time required for the growth of any individual\r\nhair than for the sudden loss of a hair.\r\n\r\nMolt was observed in some individuals no longer having juvenal pelage;\r\nsome new pelage was observed on the skins of seven mice collected in\r\nAugust. Each of these was in category 4 or 5 and probably had been born\r\nin the previous calendar year. These seven molting individuals make up\r\nnearly 17 per cent of 42 individuals that had completed the juvenal to\r\npostjuvenal molt. In November, 80 per cent of individuals (92 of 115)\r\nthat had previously obtained their postjuvenal or adult pelage were\r\nmolting. These mice were in age-categories 3, 4, and 5. Some of the\r\nindividuals in category 3 were developing new hair beneath a relatively\r\nunworn bright pelage that I judge to be an adult pelage rather than a\r\npostjuvenal pelage. If this judgment be correct and if the relatively\r\nunworn dentition (category 3) means that these animals are young of the\r\nyear, we must conclude that individuals born in early summer may molt\r\nfrom juvenal to postjuvenal, then to adult pelage, and finally in the\r\nautumn into another adult pelage. Other individuals, six in number and\r\nof categories 2 and 3, are simultaneously completing the juvenal to\r\npostjuvenal molt and beginning the postjuvenal to adult molt. The\r\njuvenal to postjuvenal molt begins, as has been described by various\r\nauthors, along the lateral line and proceeds dorsally and ventrally and\r\nanteriorly and posteriorly, and the last patch to lose the gray juvenal\r\ncolor is the top of head and nape, or less frequently the rump. In some\r\nindividuals a gray patch on the nape remained but emerging hair was not\r\napparent; perhaps the molt had been halted just prior to completion. The\r\nprogressing band of emerging hair is narrow in most specimens but in\r\nsome up to one-fifth of the circumference of the body has hair at the\r\nsame degree of emergence. Subsequent molts, both from postjuvenal to\r\nadult pelage and between adult pelages, are less regular in point, or\r\npoints, of origin, width of progressing molt, and amount of surface\r\nmolting at one time. Half or more of the dorsum is oftentimes involved\r\nin the same stage of molt at once. In some specimens the molt begins\r\nalong the lateral line, and in others in several centers on the sides.\r\nIn some skins distinct lines of molt are visible without parting the\r\nhair, and in some others the molt is patchy in appearance. Growth of new\r\nhair is apparent at various times of the year as a result of injury such\r\nas that caused by bot fly larvae, cuts, scratches, or bites of other\r\nmice. Abrasion, wear, irritation by ectoparasites, and other kinds of\r\ninjury to the skin may play a part in the development of a patchy molt.\r\nBoth breeding and molting are sources of considerable stress, and the\r\ndelay of the peak of molting activity until November when breeding\r\nactivity has decreased seems of benefit to the mice. A change in the\r\nratio of young mice (categories 1, 2, and 3) to old mice (categories 4\r\nand 5) between August and November was noted. In August, 29 per cent of\r\nthe population is composed of old mice, and in November only 6 per cent.\r\nThis change results from birth of young as well as death of old mice,\r\nbut may indicate that a mouse in November has less than one chance in\r\nten of being alive the following November. Some females born early in\r\nthe reproductive season breed in their first summer or autumn. For\r\nexample, a female of category 2, taken on August 12, and probably in\r\npostjuvenal pelage, had placental scars. Undoubtedly the young of the\r\nyear contribute to the breeding population, especially late in the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Frequency distributions, according to size, of\r\n_Reithrodontomys megalotis_ and _Peromyscus maniculatus_ in three\r\nsamples taken in August, September, and November. Sexes and pregnancy or\r\nnonpregnancy of females are indicated. See discussion in text.]\r\n\r\nIn Figure 3 the proportion of females bearing embryos in August,\r\nSeptember, and November is shown. Of the females trapped in August, 11\r\nof 32 that were more than 144 mm. in total length contained embryos; an\r\nadditional 14 females were lactating or possessed placental scars or\r\nenlarged uteri. Therefore, approximately 80 per cent of the larger\r\nfemales were reproducing in August. In September two females were\r\npregnant and an additional sixteen of the 44 females examined showed\r\nother evidence of reproduction; these eighteen females make up 41 per\r\ncent of those more than 144 mm. in total length. The only reproductive\r\ndata available for November pertain to the presence or absence of\r\nembryos. No female was pregnant although 35 females more than 144 mm. in\r\ntotal length were examined. Some of the skins show prominent mammae\r\nindicative of recent nursing, and juveniles less than a month old were\r\ntaken. The reproductive activity of deer mice on the Mesa Verde seems to\r\nbe greatly reduced in autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeromyscus difficilis nasutus (J.A. Allen) Rock Mouse\r\n\r\n     _Specimen_: 1 mi.

The two specimens from Spruce Tree Lodge obtained by R.B. Finley\r\non September 2, 1949, are young individuals.\r\n\r\n     Another species of the genus, the white-throated wood rat, _Neotoma\r\n     albigula_, may occur within the Park, since three specimens\r\n     (34757-34759) from the Mesa Verde were trapped on September 15,\r\n     1949, by R.B. Finley, approximately 4-1/2 miles south of the Park\r\n     [6 mi. E, 17 mi. S Cortez, 5600 ft.--south of the area shown in\r\n     Figure 2]. Finley (1958:450) stated that at that locality he\r\n     trapped _Neotoma mexicana_ [No. 34801], that _N. albigula_ was\r\n     perhaps more common there than _N. mexicana_, that dens of _N.\r\n     albigula_ were more common than those of _N. mexicana_ under large\r\n     rocks in the talus on the south slope of the Mesa, and that dens of\r\n     _N. mexicana_ seemed to be more numerous in crevices of ledges in\r\n     the bedrock and cliffs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOndatra zibethicus osoyoosensis (Lord) Muskrat\r\n\r\nD. Watson (in letter of January 16, 1957) reported that he has seen\r\nmuskrat tracks many times along the Mancos River. He also relates a\r\nreport received from Chief Ranger Wade and D.A. Spencer who saw a\r\nmuskrat, no doubt a wanderer, on the Knife Edge Road on a cold winter\r\nnight. These men, both reliable observers, stopped and saw the muskrat\r\nat a distance of two feet, where it took shelter under a power shovel\r\nparked beside the road. Reports of dens seen along the Mancos River are\r\navailable for 1944, 1945, 1946, and 1947.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrotus longicaudus mordax (Merriam) Long-tailed Vole\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 36: North end Mesa Verde National\r\n     Park, 7000 ft., 76233-76237; entrance to Mesa Verde National Park,\r\n     5123-5126 in Denver Museum; Prater Canyon, 7600 ft., 76238-76244;\r\n     Upper Well, Prater Canyon, 7575 ft., 69441; Morfield Canyon, 7600\r\n     ft., 76245-76259, 76261-76263; west bank Mancos River, northeast\r\n     side Mesa Verde National Park, 76260.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation at the above-named localities is a combination of brush\r\nand grasses that are both more luxuriant than in areas dominated by\r\npinyon and juniper on the more southern and altitudinally lower part of\r\nthe top of the Mesa where no _M. longicaudus_ was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrotus mexicanus mogollonensis (Mearns) Mexican Vole\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 22: Prater Canyon, 7600 ft.,\r\n     76283-76287; Sect. 27, head of east fork of Navajo Canyon, 7900\r\n     ft., 69442; Far View Ruins, 7700 ft., 69443, 79223-79224; 2 mi.

Prater\r\nCanyon is the only one of these localities at which any other species of\r\nvole was taken. There _Microtus longicaudus_ and _Microtus montanus_\r\nwere also obtained. Judging from the vegetation at the above localities,\r\n_M. mexicanus_ is to be expected in drier areas with less cover than _M.\r\nmontanus_ inhabits, and in areas having less cover than those inhabited\r\nby _M. longicaudus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrotus montanus fusus Hall Montane Vole\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 16: Upper Well, 7575 ft.,\r\n     69454-69465; 1/4 mi.

Four of the females of _M. montanus_ trapped\r\non September 3, 1956, were pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\nErethizon dorsatum couesi Mearns Porcupine\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: 69470, old [Female], and 69471,\r\n     her young male offspring, both obtained on August 28, 1956, in the\r\n     canyon of the Mancos River, 6200 feet, along the western side of\r\n     the River.\r\n\r\nI saw no other porcupine in the Park.\r\n\r\nIn 1935, C.W. Quaintance took special notice of porcupines because of\r\nthe possibility, then being considered, of their being detrimental to\r\nhabitat conditions thought to be favorable to wild turkeys. Porcupines\r\nwere suspected of killing ponderosa pine, which occurred in only a few\r\nplaces, and which was thought to be necessary for wild turkeys.\r\nPorcupines were recorded as follows: one found dead on the road at the\r\nNorth Rim on March 16; one killed in oak brush along the North Rim; one\r\nkilled between April 15 and May 15; oak brush damaged by porcupines in\r\nSoda Canyon below the well; one seen on July 4 on the Poole Canyon\r\nTrail; one seen at the foot of the Mesa on June 26; one seen by Lloyd\r\nWhite in Moccasin Canyon on June 27; and one seen by Mrs. Sharon Spencer\r\non July 1 in Prater Canyon. After four months on the Mesa Verde,\r\nQuaintance concluded that there were not so many porcupines as had been\r\nexpected and that there were more ponderosa pines than had been\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nIn 1946, Donald A. Spencer began a study of porcupines on the Mesa Verde\r\nand in 1958 deposited, in the University of Colorado Library, his\r\nresults in manuscript form as a dissertation in partial fulfillment of\r\nthe requirements for a higher degree (\"Porcupine population fluctuations\r\nin past centuries revealed by dendrochronology,\" 108 numbered and 13\r\nunnumbered pages, 39 figures, and 13 tables). Dendrochronology, or the\r\ndating of trees by studying their rings, is a technique widely used in\r\nthe southwest by archeologists, climatologists, and others. Spencer\r\nfound that porcupines damage trees in a characteristic manner, and that\r\ndamage to a pinyon pine was evident as long as the tree lived. By dating\r\napproximately 2000 scars and plotting the year for each scar, Spencer\r\nobserved three peaks since 1865; these were in about 1885, 1905, and\r\n1935. The increase and decrease each time were at about the same rate.\r\nThe study did not yield precise population estimates. Some porcupines\r\nwere destroyed but Spencer is of the opinion that the decline that came\r\nin following years was independent of the control measures. Spencer\r\nthinks that activities of porcupines on the Mesa Verde are a major\r\nfactor in maintaining a forest cover of relatively young trees, and also\r\nin preventing invasion of trees into areas of brush.\r\n\r\nThe general policy in regard to porcupines from 1930 to 1946 was to kill\r\nthem because they eat parts of trees. In at least the following years\r\nporcupines were killed: 1930, 1933, 1935, 1940, 1943, 1944, and 1946.\r\nThe largest number reported killed in one year is 71 in 1933 when a crew\r\nof men was employed for this purpose. The amount of effort devoted to\r\nkilling porcupines varied from year to year. The most frequently voiced\r\nalarm was that the scenic value of the areas along the entrance highway\r\nand near certain ruins was being impaired. The direst prediction was\r\nthat all pine trees on the Mesa Verde were doomed to extinction in the\r\nnear future. The last prediction has not come to pass, nor has this\r\nextinction occurred in the past thousand years and more during which\r\npine trees and porcupines have existed together on the Mesa Verde.\r\n\r\nIn 1946 the studies of Spencer, Wade, and Fitch began. Much effort was\r\nexpended in obtaining and dating scars for analysis, and the interesting\r\nresults mentioned above were the reward. Also many porcupines were\r\ncaptured alive and marked with ear-tags so that they could be recognized\r\nlater. For example, in the winter of 1946 and 1947, 117 were marked in\r\nSoda Canyon. A decline in numbers in recent years reduced the impetus\r\nfor continuation of the study by reducing the results obtained for each\r\nday spent searching for porcupines. Information obtained on movements of\r\nporcupines relative to season and weather conditions in these studies\r\nmay be summarized and published later. Data regarding ratio of young to\r\nadult animals from year to year are also of interest.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a porcupine on a single tree is often easy to assess. The\r\neffect of a fluctuating population of porcupines on a mixed forest is\r\nnot so easy to assess, but is of more intrinsic interest. It is\r\ndesirable that studies designed to evaluate the latter effect continue\r\nwhile the population remains low and also when the next cyclic increase\r\nbegins. Publication of Spencer's results would be a major step forward.\r\n\r\nCahalane (1948:253) mentions the difficulty that has been experienced in\r\nprotecting aesthetically desirable trees around cliff dwellings. Perhaps\r\nin a local area removal of porcupines is sometimes warranted, but\r\ncontrol of the porcupine seems undesirable to me, as a general policy,\r\nbecause one purpose of a National Park is to preserve natural conditions\r\nand that implies naturally occurring changes.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is continued careful study of the ecological\r\nrelationships of animals and of plants. National parks provide, to the\r\nextent that they are not disturbed or \"controlled,\" especially favorable\r\nplaces for studies of this sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nMus musculus subsp. House Mouse\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 7: North end Mesa Verde National\r\n     Park, 7000 ft, 76290; west bank Mancos River northeast side Mesa\r\n     Verde National Park, 76291-76296.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanis latrans mearnsi Merriam Coyote\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: 69472, skull only of a young\r\n     individual, found dead at the top of the bank of the Mancos River,\r\n     1-1/2 mi. E Waters Cabin, 6400 ft., August 29, 1956, probably\r\n     killed by man; ad. [Male], 76298, taken by J.R. Alcorn, November\r\n     10, 1957, on the top of the Mesa at Square Tower House; and skin\r\n     and skull, MV 7858/507, without data.\r\n\r\nTracks or scats of the coyote were seen in all parts of the Park\r\nvisited. Coyotes range throughout the area. On September 3, 1956, 35\r\ncoyote scats were found on the dirt roads in Prater and Morfield canyons\r\nabove 7300 feet elevation and on the road crossing the divide between\r\nthese canyons. Probably none of these scats was more than a month old.\r\nCoyote tracks were seen at some of the fresher scats. Scats associated\r\nwith fox tracks and scats of small size were not picked up.\r\nNevertheless, a few of the scats studied may have been those of foxes.\r\nJudging from the contents of scats that were certainly from foxes, the\r\neffect of inadvertent inclusion of fox scats would be to elevate the\r\npercentage of scats containing berries (but not more than five\r\npercentage points). Each scat was broken up and the percentage of scats\r\ncontaining each of the following items was noted (figures are to the\r\nnearest per cent). Remains of deer occurred in 48 per cent of scats,\r\ngooseberries (_Ribes_) in 34 per cent, porcupines in 29 per cent,\r\ninsects in 11 per cent, birds in 11 per cent, unidentified hair in 9 per\r\ncent, and unidentified material in 6 per cent. One scat (3 per cent)\r\ncontained an appreciable amount of plant debris, one contained\r\n_Microtus_ along with other items, and one contained only _Sylvilagus_;\r\n14 scats had material of more than one category. The percentage in each\r\ncategory of the volume of each scat was estimated. Data on volume\r\nwarrant no conclusion other than one that can be drawn from the\r\npercentages of occurrence, namely that the major food sources used in\r\nAugust, 1956, by coyotes in these canyons were deer, berries, and\r\nporcupines and that other sources, though used, were relatively\r\nunimportant. Deer were common in the area. It is fortunate that coyotes\r\nremain to help regulate the deer population. Wolves, _Canis lupus_,\r\nwhich at one time occurred in the Park, are now gone. The coyote and\r\nmountain lion are the only sizeable predators that remain.\r\n\r\n\r\nVulpes vulpes macroura Baird Red Fox\r\n\r\nD. Watson (in letter of January 16, 1957) reported that red foxes have\r\nbeen seen on the Mesa by several employees of the Park. These persons\r\nknow the gray fox, which often is seen in winter feeding at their back\r\ndoors, and Mr. Watson considers the reports reliable. In the early\r\nmorning of October 24, 1943, a reddish-yellow fox having a white-tipped\r\ntail was observed by three men, one of whom was Chief Ranger Wade, at\r\nPark Point. In 1948, 1950, and 1953 black foxes have been reported.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrocyon cinereoargenteus scottii Mearns Gray Fox\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: [Male], MV 7867/507, 2 mi. N of\r\n     Headquarters, 7400 ft., September 24, 1935, H.P. Pratt; [Male],\r\n     76299, November 9, and [Female], 76300, trapped on November 12,\r\n     1957, by J.R. Alcorn at Square Tower House.\r\n\r\nThe gray fox is common on the Mesa.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsus americanus amblyceps Baird Black Bear\r\n\r\nFrom 1929 through 1959 at least 151 observations of bears were recorded.\r\nObservations were unrecorded in only five years--1952, 1953, 1954, 1956,\r\nand 1958. Most observations were in the 1940's and the peak was in 1944\r\n(18 observations) and 1945 (21 observations). Cubs have been recorded in\r\n10 different years. If dated reports are tabulated by months the\r\nfollowing figures are obtained for the 12 months beginning with January:\r\n0, 0, 0, 4, 15, 19, 19, 9, 10, 9, 3, 0. The peak in the summer months\r\nand the absence of observations in the winter months are significant.\r\nIndividual bears probably enter and leave the Park in the course of\r\ntheir normal wanderings; however bears probably hibernate, breed, and\r\nbear young within the Park and should not be regarded as merely\r\noccasionally wandering into the Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcyon lotor pallidus Merriam Raccoon\r\n\r\nIn December, 1959, three raccoons were seen on Prater Grade and later\r\nthree were seen in Morfield Canyon near the tunnel. I saw a dead raccoon\r\nat the side of the highway 3 mi. WSW of Mancos, 6700 feet, on August 8,\r\n1956. This locality is outside of the Park and not on the Mesa, but is\r\nmentioned because it indicates that the raccoon probably occurs along\r\nthe Mancos River, which forms the eastern boundary of the Park. The\r\nraccoon is rare in the area. Some local persons were surprised to hear\r\nof its presence; other persons told me that raccoons were present, but\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n\r\nBassariscus astutus flavus Rhoads Ringtail\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 4: MV 7884/507 and 7885/507, trapped\r\n     in Balcony House and prepared by D. Watson in 1939; MV 7901/507 and\r\n     7902/507, without data.\r\n\r\nThe cliff dwellings are favored by ringtails and in some years they are\r\ncommon near occupied dwellings in the area of headquarters. Ringtails\r\nhave been seen in each major habitat within the Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nMustela frenata nevadensis Hall Long-tailed Weasel\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 5: MV 7891/507, [Male], from the\r\n     \"Garden\" [= Indian Cornfield]; [Female], MV 7892/507, also from\r\n     the \"Cornfield\"; MV 7859/507, \"Killed by car on Prater Grade\";\r\n     [Male], MV 7871/507, in winter pelage, from the North Rim; and\r\n     [Male], 83464, killed on the road 1/2 mi. NE of the tunnel,\r\n     Morfield Canyon.\r\n\r\nC.W. Quaintance in 1935 reported that on January 11, he and Mr. Nelson\r\nsaw a weasel attack a cottontail, and on March 9, while on the snow\r\nplow, Mr. Nelson witnessed another cottontail being killed by a weasel.\r\nWeasels in white winter pelage have been recorded in December and\r\nJanuary. The brown pelage has been seen as late as November.\r\n\r\n\r\nMustela vison energumenos (Bangs) Mink\r\n\r\nD. Watson (in letter of January 16, 1957) wrote: \"When Jack Wade, now\r\nChief Ranger, was doing patrol work in the Mancos Canyon back in the\r\n1930's, he saw mink along the river at the east side of the Park.\r\nSeveral years ago, the people who lived on the ranch where Weber Canyon\r\njoins the Mancos trapped a mink.\" Tracks have been reported along the\r\nMancos River in several years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpilogale putorius gracilis Merriam Spotted Skunk\r\n\r\n     _Specimen_: Immature [Male], MV 7860/507, Cliff Palace, August\r\n     22, 1936, prepared by A.E. Borrell.\r\n\r\nIn some years these little skunks have become so numerous in the area of\r\nheadquarters that they were a nuisance, and were captured in garbage\r\ncans and released in other parts of the Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nMephitis mephitis estor Merriam Striped Skunk\r\n\r\nD. Watson advises me that striped skunks are fairly common around the\r\nentrance to the Park, along the foot of the Mesa, and along the Mancos\r\nRiver. Striped skunks have been reported in 1951 in Morfield Canyon, in\r\n1952 on the Knife Edge, in 1953 at Windy Point (1/4 mi. N of Point\r\nLookout), and in 1959 at the head of Morfield Canyon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 1\r\n\r\nUPPER: View of the North Rim of Mesa Verde, looking west from Park\r\nPoint, the highest place on the North Rim.

Possibly fire in the last three or four hundred years on the\r\nhigher parts of the Mesa has been a factor in producing chaparral there,\r\nrather than pinyon and juniper. Photo taken in August, 1956, by S.\r\nAnderson.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTaxidea taxus berlandieri Baird Badger\r\n\r\nSeveral reports, but no specimens, of the badger have been obtained. In\r\n1935, C.W. Quaintance wrote that in School Section Canyon tracks of\r\ncougar, bobcat, coyote, and deer were found, and that pocket gophers,\r\nbadgers, and cottontail rabbits were present. Later in 1935, H.P. Pratt\r\nwrote that he had found evidence of badgers \"at the lower well in Prater\r\nCanyon, where on September 23, there were extensive badger diggings and\r\nfresh tracks in the vicinity of the prairie dog colony there.\" Badgers\r\nare common in the lowlands around the Mesa and they are common enough on\r\nthe Mesa to be regarded as nuisances by archeologists on account of\r\nbadgers digging in ruins. Badgers have been seen from three to six times\r\neach year from 1950 to this date, most of them in the vicinity of the\r\nNorth Rim.\r\n\r\n\r\nFelis concolor hippolestes Merriam Mountain Lion\r\n\r\nMountain lions range throughout the Park. There are reliable sight\r\nrecords of lions and lion tracks, but no specimen has been preserved.\r\nEarly records of observations include the report of tracks seen in\r\nNavajo Canyon by Cary (1911:165), and a lion seen in 1917. Since 1930\r\nthe more adequate records include reports of from one to eight\r\nobservations each year for 26 of the 30 years. Young animals (recorded\r\nas \"half-grown\") or cubs have been reported in four of these years. The\r\ntabulation of dated reports by month beginning with January is: 2, 0, 3,\r\n2, 8, 4, 6, 7, 4, 9, 5, 7. Mountain lions range more widely than bears\r\nin their daily and seasonal activities, but like bears probably breed,\r\nbear young, and feed in the Park. Although at any one time lions may or\r\nmay not be within the Park, it is part of their normal range and the\r\nspecies should be regarded as resident and is not uncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLynx rufus baileyi Merriam Bobcat\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: A specimen (now mounted in Park\r\n     Museum) from the Knife Edge Road; and ad. [Female], 76302,\r\n     Prater Canyon, 7500 ft., November 12, 1957, obtained by J.R.\r\n     Alcorn.\r\n\r\nBobcats are present throughout the Park. Approximately 80 observations\r\nof bobcats are on file, from all parts of the Park and in all months.\r\nProbably the bobcat and the gray fox are the most abundant carnivores in\r\nthe Park. In addition to known predation by mountain lions and coyotes\r\non porcupines, the bobcat kills porcupines. A dead porcupine and a dead\r\nbobcat with its face, mouth, and one foot full of quills were found\r\ntogether on January 31, 1952, under a boulder in front of Cliff Palace.\r\nOn August 20, 1956, I saw a bobcat hunting in sage in a draw near a\r\nlarge clump of oak-brush, into which it fled, at the head of the east\r\nfork of Navajo Canyon, Sect. 21, near the North Rim, 8100 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nOdocoileus hemionus hemionus (Rafinesque) Mule Deer\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: Young [Male], 76303, November\r\n     8, 1957, Far View Ruins; [Female], 76304, November 12, 1957,\r\n     Spruce Tree House Ruin, both obtained by J.R. Alcorn.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the Park, mule deer are common. Five projects concerning\r\ndeer are in progress or have been concluded recently on the Mesa. One is\r\na study of the responses of different species of plants to browsing and\r\nwas begun in 1949 by Harold R. Shepherd for the Colorado Department of\r\nGame and Fish. A number of individual plants and in some instances\r\ngroups of plants were fenced to exclude deer. Systematic clips of 20,\r\n40, 60, 80, or 100 per cent of the annual growth are made each year. The\r\nresults of the first ten years of this study are being prepared for\r\npublication by Shepherd.\r\n\r\nA study of browsing pressure was initiated in 1952 by Regional Biologist\r\nC.M. Aldous, on eight transects in the Park. Each transect consists of\r\n15 plots at intervals of 200 feet. The amount of use of each plant\r\nspecies was recorded from time to time. The study was terminated in\r\n1955. I have seen no summary of results of this study.\r\n\r\nA trapping program was begun in 1953 with the co-operation of the\r\nColorado Department of Game and Fish. Deer are trapped, marked, and\r\nreleased. Some are released in areas other than where trapped. In this\r\nway the excessive size of the herd near headquarters has been reduced.\r\nRecoveries of marked deer outside the Park by hunters and retrapping\r\nresults in the Park should provide information about movements of deer\r\nand about life expectancy.\r\n\r\nThe \"Deer Trend Study\" was initiated in 1954. From November to May,\r\ntwice a day, at the same time, a count is made along the entrance road\r\nfrom the Park Entrance to Headquarters. Ten drainage areas traversed are\r\ntabulated separately. The results of four years of this study indicate\r\nthat the greatest number of deer are present in November, December, and\r\nJanuary, and that only about one-fourth as many are present in February\r\nand March. Depending on severity of weather, the yearly pattern varies,\r\nthe deer arriving earlier, or leaving earlier. This change in numbers,\r\nthe recovery outside of the Park of animals marked in the Park, and\r\ndirect observations of movement indicate that the Mesa Verde is an\r\nintermediate range rather than a summer-range or winter-range. In summer\r\ndeer tend to move northward and eastward out of the Park, and in winter\r\nthey move back through the Park toward lower and more protected areas in\r\ncanyons both in the Park and south of the Park on the Ute Reservation.\r\nSome deer remain in the Park the entire year. Close co-operation between\r\npersonnel of the Park Service and of the Colorado Department of Game and\r\nFish has regulated hunting outside the Park in such a way as to provide\r\nsatisfactory control of the deer within the Park.\r\n\r\nA study of the effect of rodents on plants used by deer was initiated in\r\n1956 by Harold R. Shepherd. Three acres were fenced in a fashion\r\ndesigned to exclude rodents but not deer. An adjacent three acres were\r\nfenced as a control, but not so as to exclude rodents or deer. Eight\r\ntrap lines nearby provide an index of rodent fluctuations from year to\r\nyear. These studies will need to be continued for a period of ten years\r\nor more, and should provide much information concerning not only deer\r\nbut also rodents and their effect on vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCervus canadensis nelsoni V. Bailey Wapiti\r\n\r\nWapiti are seen periodically; probably they wander in from the higher\r\nmountains to the northeast and do not remain for long. The following\r\nnote was included in the 1921 report of Mr. Jesse L. Nusbaum, then\r\nSuperintendent of the Park: \"The first elk ever seen in the Park made\r\nhis appearance near the head of Navajo Canyon, August 15 of this year,\r\nand travelled for two miles in front of a Ford car down the main road\r\nbefore another car, travelling in the opposite direction, scared him\r\ninto the timber.\" Additional observations have been recorded as follows:\r\nSchool Section Canyon (\"fall\" 1935), Knife Edge Road (July, 1940), West\r\nSoda Canyon and Windy Point (December, 1949), Long Canyon (July, 1959),\r\nand Park Entrance (December, 1959). Three of the six observations are in\r\nJuly and August; therefore movement by wapiti into the Park can not be\r\nattributed entirely to disturbance during the hunting season.\r\n\r\n\r\nOvis canadensis canadensis Shaw Bighorn\r\n\r\nSome early records of the bighorn were mentioned by C.W. Quaintance\r\n(1935): In a letter of January 20, 1935, John Wetherill said that a\r\n\"Mountain Sheep Canyon\" (now Rock Canyon) was named for a bunch of sheep\r\nthat wintered near their camp; and Sam Ahkeah, a Navajo, says the\r\nIndians occasionally find remnants of sheep on the Mesa, which they take\r\nback to their hogans. Cahalane (1948:257) reported that hunting\r\npresumably had eliminated bighorns from the Mesa by 1896; however Jean\r\nPinkley reports that a large ram was killed on Point Lookout in 1906.\r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1946, 14 sheep (3 rams, 7 ewes, and 4 lambs) from the\r\nherd at Tarryall, Colorado, were obtained through the Colorado\r\nDepartment of Game and Fish and were released at 8:30 a.m. at the edge\r\nof the canyon south of Spruce Tree Lodge. The sheep, instead of entering\r\nthe canyon as expected, turned north, passed behind the museum, and\r\neventually disappeared northward on Chapin Mesa. The sheep evidently\r\ndivided into at least two bands. On April 24, 1946, three sheep were\r\nseen 2-1/2 mi. N of Rock Springs, and on June 19, 1947, tracks were seen\r\nin Mancos Canyon. In 1947, 1948, and 1949 farmers in Weber Canyon\r\nreported seeing sheep many times on Weber Mountain, and watering at the\r\nMancos River. In May, 1949, an estimate of 27 sheep on Weber Mountain\r\nwas made after several days study by men from the state game department.\r\nThe herds continued to increase. In 1956 I saw two bighorns. On August\r\n18, at 6:20 a.m., my wife and I briefly observed a bighorn on the rocks\r\nbelow Square Tower Ruins. On August 24, I was digging with a small\r\nshovel in rocky soil behind the cabin at Rock Springs, when hoof beats\r\nwere heard approaching in the rocky head of the canyon to the east. An\r\nadult ewe came up to the fence around the cabin area and looked at me,\r\nseemingly curious about the noise my shovel had been producing. I\r\nremained motionless and called to my wife, Justine, to come from the\r\ncabin and see the sheep. The ewe seemed not to be disturbed by my voice,\r\nbut took flight, returning in the direction from which she had come, the\r\nmoment Justine appeared from behind the cabin. Sheep can now be seen on\r\noccasion in any of the deep canyons across the southern half of the\r\nPark. The sheep have caused slight damage in some of the ruins by\r\nbedding down there, and by climbing on walls. As the sheep increase in\r\nnumbers this activity may be regarded as a problem. In 1959 an estimated\r\n75 to 100 sheep were in the Park and adjacent areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distributions of animals are influenced by geographic, vegetational,\r\nand altitudinal factors. The Mesa Verde is intermediate in geographic\r\nposition and altitude between the high Southern Rocky Mountains and the\r\nlow southwestern desert. For this reason, we find on the Mesa Verde (1)\r\na preponderance of species having wide distributions in this part of the\r\ncountry, and having relatively wide ranges of tolerance for different\r\nhabitats, (2) a lesser number of exclusively montane or boreal species\r\nthan occur in the higher mountains to the northeast of the Mesa and that\r\nmay reach the limits of their ranges here, and (3) a small number of\r\nspecies of southern or Sonoran affinities. Fifty-four species are\r\nrecorded above.\r\n\r\nForty-one of these species are represented by specimens from the Park.\r\nThirteen additional species in the list have been seen in the Park.\r\n\r\nOn the Grand Mesa, which is more elevated than, and some 110 miles north\r\nof, the Mesa Verde (see Figure 1), 55 per cent of the species of mammals\r\nhave boreal affinities and the other 45 per cent are wide-spread species\r\n(Anderson, 1959:414). Boreal species from the Mesa Verde are _Sorex\r\nvagrans_, _Sylvilagus nuttallii_, _Spermophilus lateralis_, _Marmota\r\nflaviventris_, _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus_, _Microtus montanus_, and\r\n_Microtus longicaudus_. These seven species comprise only thirteen per\r\ncent of the mammalian fauna of the Mesa Verde. Other boreal species that\r\noccur in the mountains of Colorado on the Grand Mesa or elsewhere\r\n(Findley and Anderson, 1956:80) and that do not occur on the Mesa Verde\r\nare _Sorex cinereus_, _Sorex palustris_, _Ochotona princeps_, _Lepus\r\namericana_, _Clethrionomys gapperi_, _Phenacomys intermedius_, _Zapus\r\nprinceps_, _Martes americana_, _Mustela erminea_, and _Lynx canadensis_.\r\nThe 47 species from the Mesa Verde that are not exclusively boreal make\r\nup 87 per cent of the mammalian fauna. Most of these are wide-spread\r\nspecies and are more abundant in the deserts or other lowlands than in\r\nthe coniferous forests of the highlands, for example the eight species\r\nof bats, and _Sylvilagus audubonii_, _Thomomys bottae_, _Taxidea taxus_,\r\n_Bassariscus astutus_, _Canis latrans_, _Cynomys gunnisoni_,\r\n_Reithrodontomys megalotis_, and _Lepus californicus_. A few of the\r\nwide-spread species are more common in the highlands than in the\r\nlowlands, for example _Ursus americanus_, _Felis concolor_, _Castor\r\ncanadensis_, _Erethizon dorsatum_, and _Cervus canadensis_, and the\r\nranges of three of these, the bear, mountain lion and wapiti, are more\r\nrestricted today than formerly. A few species find their favorite\r\nhabitat and reach their greatest abundance in altitudinally and\r\nvegetationally intermediate areas such as upon the Mesa Verde, or in\r\nspecial habitats, such as the rock ledges, and crevices that are so\r\nabundant on the Mesa. Examples of this group of species are\r\n_Spermophilus variegatus_, _Peromyscus crinitus_, _Peromyscus truei_,\r\n_Neotoma cinerea_, and _Neotoma mexicana_. One species, _Dipodomys\r\nordii_, is restricted to the desert. Species that are restricted to the\r\ndesert and that occur in Montezuma County, Colorado, but that are not\r\nknown from the Mesa Verde are _Ammospermophilus leucurus_, _Perognathus\r\nflavus_, and _Onychomys leucogaster_.\r\n\r\nSpecies known to have changed in numbers in the past 50 years are the\r\nmule deer that has increased, and the prairie dog that has decreased.\r\nPossibly beaver have increased along the Mancos River. The muskrat,\r\nmink, beaver, and raccoon usually occur only along the Mancos River, as\r\nthere is no other permanent surface water in the Park.\r\n\r\nSpecies such as the bighorn and the marmot that are rare within the\r\nPark, or those such as the chickaree, the prairie dog, the wandering\r\nshrew, the montane vole, and the long-tailed vole that occupy only small\r\nareas of suitable habitat within the Park are the species most likely to\r\nbe eliminated by natural changes, or through the activities of man. For\r\nexample parasites introduced through domestic sheep that wander into the\r\nrange of bighorns within the Park might endanger the bighorn population.\r\nAn increase in grazing activity, road building, and camping in Prater\r\nand Morfield canyons might eliminate the small areas of habitat occupied\r\nby the montane vole and the wandering shrew. Fire in Chickaree Draw\r\ncould destroy all the Douglas fir there, and consequently much of the\r\nhabitat occupied by the chickaree.\r\n\r\nProbably some species inhabit the Mesa that have not yet been found, but\r\nthey are probably few, and their discovery will not alter the faunal\r\npattern in which the few boreal species occupy restricted habitats in\r\nthe higher parts of the Mesa, and a preponderance of geographically\r\nwide-spread species occupy all or most of the Mesa, and surrounding\r\nareas. Additional bats are the species most likely to be added to the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n\r\n28-7577\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\nANDERSON, S.\r\n1959. Mammals of the Grand Mesa, Colorado. Univ.
