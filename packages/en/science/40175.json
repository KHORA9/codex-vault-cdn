BLAKISTON'S SON & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this text, the _pupil_, his experience, needs, and\r\ninterests have been constantly kept in mind. The order of topics,\r\nillustrations, and problems have been selected with the purpose of\r\nleading the _pupil_ into a clear understanding of the physical phenomena\r\ncontinually taking place about him.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations and conclusions reached by the \"New Movement in the\r\nTeaching of Physics\" have been incorporated into the book as a whole.\r\nThese conclusions indicate that the most efficient teaching in physics\r\ninvolves a departure from the quantitative, mathematical methods of\r\npresentation that were in general use a dozen or more years ago, toward\r\na method better adapted to the capabilities, interests, and requirements\r\nof the young people in our physics classes.\r\n\r\nThe older methods are effective with a portion of the student body which\r\nhas the greater mathematical ability and training, but they discourage a\r\nlarge majority of the pupils who are not gifted or prepared for severe\r\nmathematical analysis. For this reason, many of the more difficult\r\nmathematical demonstrations often given in physics texts are omitted.\r\nMost of the problems involve only the units employed in practical\r\nevery-day measurements.\r\n\r\nThe portions of Mechanics that are ordinarily so difficult for the\r\naverage pupil are not taken up until he has covered considerable ground\r\nwith which he is more or less familiar and not until he has become\r\nsomewhat accustomed to the methods of study and the technical terms of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThe pupil comes to the study of physics with a great number of\r\nexperiences and impressions of physical phenomena continually occurring\r\nabout him. In recognition of this fact, it has been thought best to\r\nconsider first the explanation of common things well known to all\r\npupils, such as the diffusion of gases, evaporation of liquids,\r\nexpansion of bodies when heated, and capillary action. Since the\r\nmolecular theory of matter is now supported by so many conclusive\r\nevidences, we have not hesitated to make free use of it in the early\r\nchapters. The applications of this theory are extremely helpful in\r\nexplaining every-day phenomena. Our experience shows that beginners in\r\nphysics understand and apply this theory without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations and drawings have been selected from a pedagogical\r\nrather than a spectacular point of view. Practically all of them are\r\nnew. The problems and exercises have been selected for the distinct\r\npurpose of illustrating the principles taught in the text and for their\r\npractical applications.\r\n\r\nMany direct applications to common every-day experiences are given in\r\norder to connect the subject matter with the home environment and daily\r\nobservation of physical phenomena. Some phenomena are mentioned without\r\ndetailed explanation as it is felt that the presentation of these\r\nsubjects in this manner is better for this grade of student than a\r\ncomplete analysis.\r\n\r\nSome of the special features of the text may be briefly summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n(A) _Simplicity of presentation_ is emphasized. The methods of attack,\r\nthe illustrations and examples employed in developing the subjects are\r\nparticularly adapted to beginners in physics.\r\n\r\n(B) The text is divided into some _seventy-seven sections_, each\r\ncontaining material enough for one recitation.\r\n\r\n(C) Each of these sections is summarized by a list of _important topics_\r\nwhich point out to the pupil the principles and subject matter requiring\r\nmost careful attention. The lists of important topics are also of\r\nassistance to the teacher in assigning recitations.\r\n\r\n(D) The _problems and practical exercises_ emphasize physical principles\r\nas distinguished from mathematical training. A list of exercises is\r\nplaced at the end of the several sections. They are in sufficient number\r\nto permit testing at many points and of a choice of problems by\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nThe authors wish to express their appreciation for suggestions and\r\nhelpful criticisms to many who have read the text in manuscript or\r\nproof. Especially to Professor A. P. Carman of the University of\r\nIllinois and his associate, Professor F. R. Watson, who have gone\r\ncarefully over the whole text; and to Mr. Chas. M. Brunson, Scott High\r\nSchool, Toledo, Ohio, Mr. Frank E. Goodell, North High School, Des\r\nMoines, Iowa, and to Mr. Walter R. Ahrens, Englewood High School,\r\nChicago, for assistance in reading the proofs. Also to Mr. W. H.\r\nCollins, Jr., Bowen High School, Chicago, who supervised the preparation\r\nof drawings for the diagrams and figures; and to many firms and\r\nindividuals that have courteously furnished material for illustrations.\r\n\r\n    WILLIS E. TOWER.\r\n    CHARLES H. SMITH.\r\n    CHARLES M. TURTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE STUDY OF PHYSICS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a pupil begins the study of Physics he has in his possession many\r\nbits of knowledge which are fundamental in the science. He has learned\r\nto throw a ball and can tell how a thrown ball moves. He has drawn out\r\nnails with a claw hammer. He has seen wood float and iron sink. He has\r\nsucked liquids up through straws. In his mother's kitchen, he sees water\r\nas ice, liquid, and steam. On a wintry day he reads the temperature on a\r\nthermometer. He sees sparks fly from car wheels when the brakes are\r\napplied. He has played with a horseshoe magnet, and has found the north\r\nby means of a compass. The telephone, the electric light and the motor\r\nhe sees, and perhaps uses, many times a day. He dresses before a mirror,\r\nfocuses his camera, watches the images at a moving picture show, and\r\nadmires the colors of the rainbow. He has cast stones into water to\r\nwatch the ripples spread, has shouted to hear the echo, and perhaps\r\nplays some musical instrument. These, and a thousand other things, are\r\nknown to the intelligent and normal boy or girl who has reached the age\r\nat which the study of Physics is properly begun.\r\n\r\nTo a great extent even the terms used in the science are familiar to the\r\nbeginner. He speaks of the horse-power of an engine, reads\r\nkilowatt-hours from the meter in the cellar, and may know that\r\nilluminating gas costs one dollar per thousand \"cubic feet.\" \"Ampere\"\r\nand \"volt\" are words he frequently hears and sees.\r\n\r\nWhen he takes up the study of Physics, the attitude of the student\r\ntoward these familiar things and words must undergo a change. Casual\r\ninformation about them must be changed to sound knowledge, purposely\r\nacquired. Hazy notions about the meanings of words must be replaced by\r\nexact definitions. Bits of knowledge must be built into a structure in\r\nwhich each fact finds its proper place in relation to the others.\r\n\r\nThe only agent which can accomplish these changes is the student\r\nhimself. He must consciously and purposely seek the truth and must\r\nreflect upon it until he sees it in its relation to other truth. Upon\r\nhim, and upon him alone, rests the final responsibility for the success\r\nor failure of his study.\r\n\r\nBut the student is not without assistance. In his teacher he finds a\r\nguide to stimulate, to direct, and to aid his efforts, and a critic to\r\npoint out wherein his efforts have failed and wherein they have\r\nsucceeded. Weights, measures, and other apparatus are furnished to\r\nenable him to answer for himself questions which have arisen in his\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these the student has his text book, his teacher for his\r\nhours of private study. A good text book is an inspiring teacher in\r\nprint. It directs attention to things familiar to the student through\r\nlong experience, and inspires him to make a closer scrutiny of them. It\r\ninvites him to observe, to analyze, to compare, to discover likenesses\r\nand differences in behavior. It questions him at every turn. Its ever\r\nrepeated challenge reads, \"Weigh and consider.\" It furnishes him needed\r\ninformation that he cannot otherwise acquire. It satisfies his desire to\r\nknow, \"By whom, where, when, and how was this first discovered?\"\r\n\r\nThe student of Physics must never forget that he is studying not pages\r\nof text but the behavior and properties of iron, water, mica, moving\r\nballs, pumps, boiling liquids, compressed air, mirrors, steam engines,\r\nmagnets, dynamos, violins, flutes, and a host of other things. His\r\nstudies should, whenever possible, be made first hand upon the things\r\nthemselves. The text is an aid to study, never a substitute for the\r\nthing studied.\r\n\r\nIt is an excellent plan for each student to select some one thing for\r\nspecial study, the telephone for example. By observation, experiment,\r\nand reading, he may acquire a large amount of valuable information about\r\nsuch a subject while pursuing his course in Physics. Every part of the\r\nscience will be found to bear some relation to it.\r\n\r\nThe student who takes up the study of Physics in the way suggested will\r\nfind himself at the end of a year of study in possession of much new and\r\nvaluable knowledge about the physical world in which he lives. By virtue\r\nof this knowledge he will be better able to enjoy the world, to control\r\nit, and to use it.\r\n\r\n    THOMAS D.

Physics, an Explanation of Common Things.=--Many students take up\r\nthe study of physics expecting to see wonderful experiments with the \"X\"\r\nrays, wireless telegraphy, dynamos, and other interesting devices.\r\nOthers are dreading to begin a study that to them seems strange and\r\ndifficult, because they fear it deals with ideas and principles that are\r\nbeyond their experience and hard to comprehend.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes is surprised to learn that _physics is mainly an\r\nexplanation of common things_. It is a study that systematizes our\r\nknowledge of the forces and changes about us; such as the pull of the\r\nearth, the formation of dew, rain and frost, water pressure and pumps,\r\nechoes and music, thermometers and engines, and many other things about\r\nus with which people are more or less familiar. Physics is like other\r\nschool subjects, such as mathematics and language, in having its own\r\npeculiar vocabulary and methods of study; these will be acquired as\r\nprogress is made in the course.\r\n\r\nThe most useful habit that the student of physics can form is that of\r\nconnecting or relating each _new idea_ or _fact_ that is presented to\r\nhim to _some observation_ or _experience_ that will illustrate the new\r\nidea. This relating or connecting of the new ideas to one's own personal\r\nexperience is not only one of the best known means of cultivating the\r\nmemory and power of association, but it is of especial help in a subject\r\nsuch as physics, which deals with the systematic study and explanation\r\nof the facts of our every-day experience.\r\n\r\n=2. Knowledge--Common and Scientific.=--This leads to the distinction\r\nbetween _common knowledge and scientific knowledge_. We all possess\r\ncommon knowledge of the things about us, gained from the impressions\r\nreceived by our senses, from reading, and from the remarks of others.\r\n_Scientific_ knowledge is attained when the bits of common knowledge are\r\nconnected and explained by other information gained through study or\r\nexperience. That is, common knowledge becomes scientific, when it is\r\n_organized_. This leads to the definition: _Science is organized\r\nknowledge_.\r\n\r\nCommon knowledge of the forces and objects about us becomes scientific\r\nonly as we are able to make accurate measurements of these. That is,\r\nscience is concerned not only in _how_ things work, but even more in\r\n_how much_ is involved or results from a given activity. For example, a\r\nscientific farmer must be able to compute his costs and results in order\r\nto determine accurately his net profits. The business man who is\r\nconducting his business with efficiency knows accurately his costs of\r\nproduction and distribution.\r\n\r\nThis book is written in the hope that it will make more scientific the\r\nstudent's common knowledge of the forces and changes in the world about\r\nhim and will give him many ideas and principles that will help him to\r\nacquire the habit of looking from effects to their natural causes and\r\nthus tend to develop what is called the _scientific habit of thought_.\r\n\r\n=3. Hypothesis, Theory, and Law.=--Three words that are frequently used\r\nin science may be mentioned here: _hypothesis_, _theory_, and _law_. An\r\nhypothesis is a supposition advanced to explain some effect, change, or\r\ncondition that has been observed. For example, the Nebular Hypothesis of\r\nwhich many high-school students have heard, is an attempt to explain the\r\norigin of the sun, the earth, the planets, and other solar systems.\r\n\r\nA theory is an hypothesis which has been tested in a variety of ways and\r\nwhich seems to fit the conditions and results so that it is generally\r\naccepted as giving a satisfactory explanation of the matter in question.\r\nThe Molecular Theory of Matter which states that matter of all kinds is\r\ncomposed of very small particles called molecules (see Art. 6), is a\r\nfamiliar example of a theory.\r\n\r\nA theory becomes a law when it may be definitely proved. Many laws are\r\nexpressed in mathematical language, e.g., the law of gravitation. (See\r\nArt. 88.) Many of the laws of physics are illustrated by laboratory\r\nexperiments, which show in a simple way just what the law means.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\nExplain what is meant by the following terms and expressions:\r\n\r\n1. Common knowledge.\r\n\r\n2. Scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\n3. Science.\r\n\r\n4. Topics in physics.\r\n\r\n5. Scientific habit of thought.\r\n\r\n6. Value of relating new ideas to former experiences.\r\n\r\n7. Hypothesis.\r\n\r\n8. Theory.\r\n\r\n9. Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) THE STATES OF MATTER\r\n\r\n=4. Physics Defined.=--In the study of any science or field of\r\nknowledge, it is helpful to have a basis for grouping or classifying the\r\nfacts studied. In physics we are to study the objects, forces, and\r\nchanges about us, to understand them and their relations to one another.\r\nAccordingly, physics, dealing with the material world about us, is often\r\ndefined as _the science of matter and energy_, _matter_ being _anything\r\nthat occupies space_ and _energy_ the _capacity for doing work_. This\r\ndefinition of physics while not strictly accurate is sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive for our present purpose.\r\n\r\n=5. The Three States of Matter.=--Our bodies are _matter_ since they\r\noccupy space. Further, they possess _energy_ since they are able to do\r\nwork. In beginning the study of physics it will simplify our work if we\r\nstudy one of these topics before the other. We will therefore begin with\r\nmatter and consider first its three states.\r\n\r\nSome bodies are _solid_; as ice, iron, wax. Others are _liquid_; as\r\nwater, mercury, oil. Still others are in the state of _gas_; as steam,\r\nair, and illuminating gas. Further we notice that the same substance may\r\nbe found in any one of the three states. For example water may be either\r\nice, water or steam; that is, either a solid, a liquid, or a gas.\r\n\r\nMost persons have heard of _liquid air_ and possibly some know of _ice\r\nair_, _i.e._, air cooled until it not only liquefies, but is solidified.\r\nOn the other hand, iron may be melted and, if heated hot enough, may be\r\nturned into iron vapor. In fact most substances by heating or cooling\r\nsufficiently may be changed into any one of the three states.\r\n\r\nBefore defining the three states, let us consider the _structure_ of\r\nmatter. This may help us to answer the question: How is it possible to\r\nchange a hard solid, such as ice, into a liquid, water, and then into\r\nan invisible gas like steam? This is explained by the molecular theory\r\nof matter.\r\n\r\n=6. The Molecular Theory of Matter.=--It is believed that all bodies are\r\nmade up of very small particles called _molecules_, and that these\r\ninstead of being packed tightly together like square packages in a box,\r\nare, strange as it may seem, very loosely packed even in solids and do\r\nnot _permanently_ touch their neighbors. The size of these molecules is\r\nso minute that it has been estimated that if a drop of water could be\r\nmagnified to the size of the earth, the molecules magnified in the same\r\nproportion would be in size between a baseball and a football. The air\r\nand all other gases are believed to be made up of molecules in _rapid\r\nmotion_, striking and rebounding continually from one another and from\r\nany objects in contact with the gas.\r\n\r\n=7. States of Matter Defined.=--These ideas of the structure of matter\r\nassist us in understanding the following definitions: _A solid is that\r\nstate of matter in which the molecules strongly cling together and tend\r\nto keep the same relative positions_. (This of course follows from the\r\ntendency of a solid to retain a definite form.) _A liquid is that state\r\nof matter in which the molecules tend to cling together, yet move about\r\nfreely._ Hence a liquid takes the form of any vessel in which it is\r\nplaced. _A gas is that state of matter in which the molecules move about\r\nfreely and tend to separate indefinitely._ Hence a gas will fill any\r\nspace in which it is placed.\r\n\r\n=8. Effect of Heat on Matter.=--It is further believed that when a body\r\nis heated, that the action really consists in making its molecules move\r\nor vibrate faster and faster as the heating progresses. This increase of\r\nmotion causes the molecules to push apart from one another and this\r\nseparation of the molecules causes an expansion of the body whether it\r\nbe solid, liquid, or gas. Fig. 1 shows the expansion of air in an air\r\nthermometer. Fig. 2 shows the expansion of a solid on heating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--When the bulb is heated, the air within expands\r\nforcing down the water in the tube.]\r\n\r\n=9. Physical and Chemical Changes.= A change of state such as the\r\nfreezing or boiling of water is called a _physical_ change, for this\r\nchange has not affected the identity of the substance. It is water even\r\nthough it has become solid or gaseous. Heating a platinum wire red hot\r\nis also a physical change for the wire when on cooling is found to be\r\nthe same substance as before. Further if salt or sugar be dissolved in\r\nwater the act of _solution_ is also a physical change since the\r\nidentical substance (salt or sugar) is in the solution and may be\r\nobtained by evaporating the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2 (_a_) represents a straight bar made of a strip of\r\nbrass and a strip of iron riveted together and attached to a handle.\r\nUpon heating the compound bar in a gas flame, the brass expands faster\r\nthan the iron causing the bar to bend toward the latter as in Fig. 2\r\n(_b_).]\r\n\r\nIf some sugar, however, is heated strongly, say in a test-tube, it is\r\nfound to blacken, some water is driven off and on cooling _some black\r\ncharcoal is found in the tube instead of the sugar_. This action which\r\nhas resulted in a _change in the nature of the substance_ treated is\r\ncalled a _chemical_ change. To illustrate further, if some magnesium\r\nwire is heated strongly in a flame, it burns, giving off an intense\r\nlight and when it cools one finds it changed to a light powdery\r\nsubstance like ashes. Chemical changes, or those that change the nature\r\nof the substance affected, are studied in _chemistry_. In _physics_ we\r\nhave to do only with physical changes, that is, with those changes that\r\ndo not affect the nature of the substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

The Metric System.=--In order to study the three states of matter\r\nwith sufficient exactness it is necessary to employ a system of\r\nmeasurement. The system universally employed by scientists is called\r\n_The Metric System_. In many respects it is the most convenient for all\r\npurposes. Every student should therefore become familiar with it and\r\nlearn to use it. At the present time, not only do scientists everywhere\r\nuse it, but many countries have adopted it and use it in common\r\nmeasurements. It was legalized in the United States in 1866. The metric\r\nsystem was originated by the French Academy of Sciences during the\r\nlatter part of the 18th century. There were so many different systems of\r\nweights and measures in use, each country having a system of its own,\r\nthat commerce was much hindered. It was therefore decided to make a\r\nsystem based upon scientific principles. The length of the earth's\r\nquadrant passing from the equator to the pole was determined by\r\nsurveying and computation. One-ten-millionth of this distance was\r\nselected as the unit of length and called a _meter_. Accurate copies of\r\nthis meter were made and preserved as standards.\r\n\r\nLater surveys have shown that the original determination of the earth's\r\nquadrant was not strictly accurate; so that after all the meter is not\r\nexactly one-ten-millionth of the earth's quadrant.\r\n\r\n=11. The Standard Meter.=--The standard unit of _length_ in the metric\r\nsystem is the _meter_. It is the distance, at the temperature of melting\r\nice, between two transverse parallel lines ruled on a bar of platinum\r\n(see Fig. 3), which is kept in the Palace of the Archives in Paris.\r\nAccurate copies of this and other metric standards are also kept at the\r\nBureau of Standards at Washington, D. C. Fig. 4 shows the relation\r\nbetween the inch and the centimeter (one-hundredth of a meter).\r\n\r\n=12. Units and Tables in the Metric System.=--The metric unit of _area_\r\ncommonly used in physics is the _square centimeter_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--The standard meter.]\r\n\r\nThe standard unit of _volume_ or capacity is the _liter_. It is a cube\r\none-tenth of a meter on each edge. It is equal to 1.057 quarts. It\r\ncorresponds, therefore, to the quart in English measure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Centimeter and inch scales.]\r\n\r\nThe standard unit of _mass_ is the _kilogram_. It is the mass of 1 liter\r\nof pure water at the temperature of its greatest density, 4°C. or\r\n39.2°F.\r\n\r\nThe three principal units of the metric system, the _meter_, the\r\n_liter_, and the _kilogram_, are related to one another in a simple\r\nmanner, since the liter is a cube one-tenth of a meter in each dimension\r\nand the kilogram is the mass of a liter of water. (See Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe metric system is a _decimal_ system that is, one unit is related to\r\nanother unit in the ratio of _ten_ or of some power of ten. This is\r\nindicated by the following tables:\r\n\r\n  _Metric Table of Length_\r\n\r\n  10 millimeters (mm.) equal 1 centimeter.\r\n  10 centimeters (cm.) equal 1 decimeter.\r\n  10 decimeters  (dm.) equal 1 meter.\r\n  10 meters      (m.)  equal 1 dekameter.\r\n  10 dekameters  (Dm.) equal 1 hectometer.\r\n  10 hectometers (hm.) equal 1 kilometer.\r\n  10 kilometers  (km.) equal 1 myriameter.\r\n\r\nThe measures commonly used are the _centimeter_, _meter_ and\r\n_kilometer_.\r\n\r\n  _Metric Table of Mass_ (_or Weight_)\r\n\r\n  10 milligrams (mg.) equal 1 centigram.\r\n  10 centigrams (cg.) equal 1 decigram.\r\n  10 decigrams  (dg.) equal 1 gram.\r\n  10 grams      (g.)  equal 1 dekagram.\r\n  10 dekagrams  (Dg.) equal 1 hectogram.\r\n  10 hectograms (hg.) equal 1 kilogram.\r\n  10 kilograms  (kg.) equal 1 myriagram.\r\n\r\nThe masses commonly used are the _milligram_, _gram_ and _kilogram_.\r\n\r\nNotice in these tables the similarity to 10 mills equal 1 cent, 10 cents\r\nequal 1 dime, 10 dimes equal 1 dollar, in the table of United States\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nOther tables in the metric system are built upon the same plan. Learn\r\nthe prefixes in order thus: milli, centi, deci, deka, hecto, kilo,\r\nmyria. The first three prefixes are Latin numerals and represent\r\ndivisions of the unit. The last four are Greek numerals and represent\r\nmultiples. In these tables, milli means 1/1000, centi means 1/100, deci\r\nmeans 1/10, deka means 10, hecto, 100, kilo, 1000, myria, 10,000. Two\r\nother prefixes are sometimes used, _micro_ which means 1/1,000,000; as\r\nmicrofarad or microvolt, and _meg_ which means 1,000,000, as megohm\r\nmeaning 1,000,000 ohms.\r\n\r\n=13. Advantages of the Metric System.=--_First_, it is a decimal system;\r\n_second_, the same form and prefixes are used in every table; _third_,\r\nthe standards of length (meter), volume (liter), and mass (kilogram)\r\nbear a simple relation to one another. This simple relation between the\r\nthree standard units may be given thus: _first_, the liter is a cubic\r\ndecimeter, and _second_, the kilogram is the mass of a liter of water.\r\n(See Fig. 5) Since the liter is a cubic decimeter, the length of one\r\nside is 10 cm. The liter therefore holds 1000 ccm. (10 × 10 × 10).\r\nTherefore, 1 liter = 1 cu. dm. = 1000 ccm. and since 1 liter of water\r\nhas a mass of 1 kg. or 1000 g., then 1000 ccm. of water has a mass of\r\n1000 g., or _1 ccm. of water has a mass of 1 g._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--One liter of the water has a mass of one\r\nkilogram.]\r\n\r\nThe following table of equivalents gives the relation between the most\r\ncommon English and metric units. Those marked (*) should be memorized.\r\n\r\n  (*) 1 meter   = 39.37 inches.        1 cu, in. = 16.387 ccm.\r\n  (*) 1 inch    = 2.54 cm.             1 cu. ft. = 28315 cm.\r\n      1 foot    = 30.48 cm.            1 cu. m.  = 1.308 cu. yd.\r\n      1 mile    = 1.609 km.

G. S. SYSTEM. Scientists have devised a plan for expressing any\r\nmeasurement in terms of what are called the _three fundamental units of\r\nlength_, _mass_, and _time_. The units used are the _centimeter_, the\r\n_gram_ and the _second_. Whenever a measurement has been reduced to its\r\nequivalent in terms of these units, it is said to be expressed in\r\n_C.G.S._ units.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Size of Molecules.=--The difference between solids, liquids, and\r\ngases has been explained as due to the different behavior of molecules\r\nin the three states of matter. That is, in solids they cling together,\r\nin liquids they move freely, and in gases they separate. At this time we\r\nare to consider the _evidences_ of molecular motion in gases. It must be\r\nkept in mind that molecules are exceedingly small. It has been said that\r\nif a bottle containing about 1 ccm. of ordinary air has pierced in it a\r\nminute opening so that 100,000,000 molecules (a number nearly equal to\r\nthe population of the United States) pass out every second, it would\r\ntake, not minutes or hours, but nearly 9000 years for all of the\r\nmolecules to escape. The number of molecules in 1 ccm. of air at 0°C.\r\nand 76 cm. pressure has been calculated by Professor Rutherford to be\r\n2.7 × 10¹⁹. It is evident that such minute particles cannot be seen or\r\nhandled as _individuals_. We must judge of their size and action by the\r\nresults obtained from experiments.\r\n\r\n=15. Diffusion of Gases.=--One line of evidence which indicates that a\r\ngas consists of moving particles is the rapidity with which a gas having\r\na strong odor penetrates to all parts of a room. For example, if\r\nilluminating gas is escaping it soon diffuses and is noticed throughout\r\nthe room. In fact, the common experience of the diffusion of gases\r\nhaving a strong odor is such that we promptly recognize that it is due\r\nto motion of some kind. The gas having the odor consists of little\r\nparticles that are continually hitting their neighbors and are being\r\nstruck and buffeted in turn until the individual molecules are widely\r\nscattered. When cabbage is boiled in the kitchen soon all in the house\r\nknow it. Other illustrations of the _diffusion_ of gases will occur to\r\nanyone from personal experience, such for instance as the pleasing odor\r\nfrom a field of clover in bloom.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment illustrates the rapid diffusion of gases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6_a_.--Diffusion of gases.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6_b_.--Effusion of gases.]\r\n\r\n     Take two tumblers (see Fig. 6_a_), wet the inside of one with a few\r\n     drops of strong ammonia water and the other with a little\r\n     hydrochloric acid. Cover each with a sheet of clean paper. Nothing\r\n     can now be seen in either tumbler. Invert the second one over the\r\n     first with the paper between, placing them so that the edges will\r\n     match. On removing the paper it is noticed that both tumblers are\r\n     quickly filled with a cloud of finely divided particles, the two\r\n     substances having united chemically to form a new substance,\r\n     ammonium chloride.\r\n\r\nOn account of their small size, molecules of air readily pass through\r\nporous solids, cloth, unglazed earthenware, etc. The following\r\nexperiment shows this fact strikingly. (See Fig. 6_b_.)\r\n\r\n     A flask containing water is closed by a rubber stopper through\r\n     which pass the stem of a glass funnel and a bent glass tube that\r\n     has been drawn out to a small opening (_J_). The funnel has\r\n     cemented in its top an inverted porous clay jar (_C_), over the top\r\n     of the latter is placed a beaker (_B_). A piece of flexible rubber\r\n     tubing (_H_) leading from a hydrogen generator is brought up to the\r\n     top of the space between the jar and the beaker. When hydrogen gas\r\n     is allowed to flow into the space between _C_ and _B_, the level of\r\n     the water in _W_ is seen to lower and a stream of water runs out at\r\n     _J_ spurting up into the air.\r\n\r\n     On stopping the flow of hydrogen and removing _B_, the water falls\r\n     rapidly in _J_ and bubbles of air are seen to enter the water from\r\n     the tube. (The foregoing steps may be repeated as often as\r\n     desired).\r\n\r\n     This experiment illustrates the fact that the molecules of some\r\n     gases move faster than those of some other gases. Hydrogen\r\n     molecules are found to move about four times as fast as air\r\n     molecules. Hence, while both air and hydrogen molecules are at\r\n     first going in opposite directions through the walls of _C_, the\r\n     hydrogen goes in much faster than the air comes out. In consequence\r\n     it accumulates, creates pressure, and drives down the water in _W_\r\n     and out at _J_. On removing _B_, the hydrogen within the porous cup\r\n     comes out much faster than the air reënters. This lessens the\r\n     pressure within, so that air rushes in through _J_. This experiment\r\n     demonstrates not only the fact of molecular motion in gases but\r\n     also that molecules of hydrogen move much faster than those of air.\r\n     (This experiment will work with illuminating gas but not so\r\n     strikingly.)\r\n\r\nCareful experiments have shown that the speed of ordinary air molecules\r\nis 445 meters or 1460 ft. per second; while hydrogen molecules move at\r\nthe rate of 1700 meters or 5575 ft. or more than a mile per second.\r\n\r\n=16. Expansion of Gases.=--Gases also possess the property of indefinite\r\nexpansion, that is, if a small quantity of gas is placed in a vacuum,\r\nthe gas will expand immediately to fill the entire space uniformly. This\r\nis shown by an experiment with the air pump. On raising the piston the\r\nair follows instantly to fill up the space under it. As the air is\r\nremoved from the receiver of an air pump the air remaining is uniformly\r\ndistributed within.\r\n\r\n=17. How Gases Exert Pressure.=--It is further found that air under\r\nordinary conditions exerts a pressure of about 15 lbs. to the square\r\ninch. In an automobile tire the pressure may be 90 lbs. and in a steam\r\nboiler it may be 200 lbs. or more to the square inch.\r\n\r\nHow is the pressure produced? The molecules are not packed together\r\nsolidly in a gas, for when steam changes to water it shrinks to about\r\n1/1600 of its former volume. Air diminishes to about 1/800 of its volume\r\non changing to liquid air. The pressure of a gas is not due then to the\r\ngas filling all of the space in which it acts, but is due rather to the\r\n_motion_ of the molecules. The blow of a single molecule is\r\nimperceptible, but when multitudes of molecules strike against a surface\r\ntheir combined effect is considerable. In fact, this action is known to\r\nproduce the pressure that a gas exerts against the walls of a containing\r\nvessel. Naturally if we compress twice as much gas into a given space\r\nthere will be twice as many molecules striking in a given time, which\r\nwill give twice as much pressure.\r\n\r\nIf gas is heated, it is found that the heat will cause a swifter motion\r\nof the molecules. This will also make the molecules strike harder and\r\nhence cause the gas to expand or exert more pressure.\r\n\r\n=17a. Brownian Movements.=--Direct photographic evidence of the motion\r\nof molecules in gases has been obtained by studying the behavior of\r\nminute drops of oil suspended in stagnant air. Such drops instead of\r\nbeing at rest are constantly dancing about as if they were continually\r\nreceiving blows from many directions. These motions have been called\r\n_Brownian Movements_ (see Fig. 7).\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that these movements are due to the blows that these\r\nsmall drops receive from the swiftly moving molecules of the gas about\r\nthem. If the drops are made smaller or the gas more dense, the movements\r\nincrease in intensity. These effects are especially marked at a pressure\r\nof 0.01 of an atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Photograph of Brownian movement. This record is\r\nprepared by the aid of Siedentopf's ultra-microscope and a plate moving\r\nuniformly across the field from left to right.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that air and all gases are made up of molecules in rapid\r\nmotion; that this motion is dependent upon temperature and pressure.\r\nEvidence of this is shown by (a) diffusion, (b) expansion, (c) pressure.\r\nBrownian Movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\n\r\n1. What is the molecular (kinetic) theory of gases?\r\n\r\n2. What three kinds of evidence help to confirm the theory?\r\n\r\n3. What have you seen that seems to show that a gas consists of\r\nmolecules in motion?\r\n\r\n4. How many meters long is a 10-ft. pole?\r\n\r\n5. A 50-kg. boy weighs how many pounds?\r\n\r\n6. What are three advantages of the metric system?\r\n\r\n7. What will 12 qts. of milk cost at 8 cents a liter?\r\n\r\n8. A cube 1 meter each way will contain how many cubic centimeters? How\r\nmany liters? What will a cubic meter of water weigh?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) MOLECULAR MOTION IN LIQUIDS\r\n\r\n=18. Diffusion of Liquids.=--From the evidence given in Arts. 14-17, (a)\r\nof diffusion of odors, (b) of the continued _expansion_ of air in the\r\nair pump, and (c) of the pressure exerted by a gas in all directions,\r\none may realize without difficulty that a _gas consists of small\r\nparticles in rapid motion_. Let us now consider some of the evidence of\r\nmolecular motion in liquids. If a little vinegar is placed in a pail of\r\nwater, all of the water will soon taste sour. A lump of sugar in a cup\r\nof tea will sweeten the entire contents. This action is somewhat similar\r\nto the diffusion of gases but it takes place much more slowly. It is\r\ntherefore believed that the motion of liquid molecules is much slower\r\nthan that of gas molecules.\r\n\r\nAgain, if a dish of water is left standing in the open air in fine\r\nweather, within a few days the dish will become dry though no one has\r\ntaken anything from it. We say the water has _evaporated_. What was\r\nliquid is now _vapor_. If we were to observe carefully any dish of water\r\nwe would find that it continually loses weight on dry days. That is,\r\nthere is a constant movement of the molecules of water into the air.\r\nThis movement of the molecules is explained as follows. There appear to\r\nbe in the dish of water some molecules that by moving back and forth\r\nacquire a greater velocity than their neighbors; when these reach the\r\nsurface of the liquid, some vibration or movement sends them flying into\r\nthe air above. They are now vapor or gas molecules, flying, striking,\r\nand rebounding like the air molecules. Sometimes on rebounding, the\r\nwater molecules get back into the water again. This is especially apt to\r\nhappen when the air is damp, _i.e._, when it contains many water\r\nmolecules. Sometimes the air over a dish becomes _saturated_, as in the\r\nupper part of a corked bottle containing water. Although molecules are\r\ncontinually leaving the surface of the water they cannot escape from the\r\nbottle, so in time as many molecules must return to the water from the\r\nspace above as leave the water in the same time. When this condition\r\nexists, the air above the water is said to be _saturated_. On very damp\r\ndays the air is often saturated. The explanation above shows why wet\r\nclothes dry so slowly on such a day (See Arts. 166-7 on Saturation.)\r\n\r\n=19. Cooling Effect of Evaporation.= We have seen that warming a gas\r\nincreases its volume. This expansion is due to the increased motion of\r\nthe warmed molecules. Now the molecules that escape from a liquid when\r\nit evaporates are naturally the fastest moving ones, _i.e._, the hottest\r\nones. The molecules remaining are the slower moving ones or colder\r\nmolecules. The liquid therefore becomes colder as it evaporates, unless\r\nit is heated. This explains why water evaporating on the surface of our\r\nbodies cools us. In evaporating, the water is continually losing its\r\nwarm, fast moving molecules. The _cooling effect_ of evaporation is,\r\ntherefore an evidence of molecular motion in liquids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Osmosis Shown by carrot placed in water.]\r\n\r\n=20. Osmosis.=--If two liquids are separated by a membrane or porous\r\npartition, they tend to pass through and mix. This action is called\r\nosmose, or _osmosis_.\r\n\r\n     Such a movement of liquid molecules in osmosis may be illustrated\r\n     by filling a beet or carrot that has had its interior cut out to\r\n     form a circular opening (see Fig. 8) with a thick syrup. The\r\n     opening is then closed at the top with a rubber stopper through\r\n     which passes a long glass tube.\r\n\r\n     If the carrot is immersed in water, as in Fig. 8, a movement of\r\n     water through the porous wall to the interior begins at once. Here,\r\n     as in the experiment of the hydrogen and air passing through the\r\n     porous cup, the lighter fluid moves faster. The water collecting in\r\n     the carrot rises in the tube. This action of liquids passing\r\n     through porous partitions and mingling is called _osmosis_.\r\n\r\nGases and liquids are alike in that each will _flow_. Each is therefore\r\ncalled a _fluid_. Sometimes there is much resistance to the flow of a\r\nliquid as in molasses. This resistance is called _viscosity_. Alcohol\r\nand gasoline have little viscosity. They are _limpid_ or _mobile_. Air\r\nalso has some viscosity. For instance, a stream of air always drags some\r\nof the surrounding air along with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Liquids behave as if they were composed of small particles in motion.\r\n\r\n2. This is shown by (1) Diffusion, (2) Solution, (3) Evaporation, (4)\r\nExpansion, (5) Osmosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1. Give an example or illustration of each of the five evidences of\r\nmolecular motion in liquids.\r\n\r\n2. When is air saturated? What is the explanation?\r\n\r\n3. Why does warming a liquid increase its rate of evaporation?\r\n\r\n4. Air molecules are in rapid motion in all directions. Do they enter a\r\nliquid with a surface exposed to the air? Give reason.\r\n\r\n5. What are some of the inconveniences of living in a saturated\r\natmosphere?\r\n\r\n6. Fish require oxygen. How is it obtained?\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) MOLECULAR FORCES IN LIQUIDS\r\n\r\n=21. Cohesion and Adhesion.=--In liquids \"the molecules move about\r\nfreely yet tend to cling together.\" This tendency of molecules to cling\r\ntogether which is not noticeable in gases is characteristic of =liquids=\r\nand especially of =solids=. It is the cause of the viscosity mentioned\r\nin the previous section and is readily detected in a variety of ways.\r\nFor instance, not only do liquid molecules cling together to form drops\r\nand streams, but they cling to the molecules of solids as well, as is\r\nshown by the wet surface of an object that has been dipped in water. The\r\nattraction of like molecules for one another is called _cohesion_, while\r\nthe attraction of =unlike molecules= is called _adhesion_, although the\r\nforce is the same whether the molecules are alike or unlike. It is the\r\nformer that causes drops of water to form and that holds iron, copper,\r\nand other solids so rigidly together. The adhesion of glue to other\r\nobjects is well known. Paint also \"sticks\" well. Sometimes the \"joint\"\r\nwhere two boards are glued together is stronger than the board itself.\r\nThe force of attraction between molecules has been studied carefully.\r\nThe attraction acts only through very short distances. The attraction\r\neven in liquids is considerable and may be measured. The cohesion of\r\nwater may be shown by an experiment where the force required to pull a\r\nglass plate from the surface of water is measured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--The water is pulled apart.]\r\n\r\n     Take a beam balance and suspend from one arm a circular glass\r\n     plate, Fig. 9. Weigh the plate and its support. Adjust the glass\r\n     plate so that it hangs horizontally and just touches the surface of\r\n     clean water, the under side being completely wet. Now find what\r\n     additional weight is required to raise the glass plate from the\r\n     water.\r\n\r\nJust as the plate comes from the water its under side is found to be\r\nwet. That is, _the water was pulled apart_, and the plate was not pulled\r\nfrom the water. The cohesion of the water to itself is not so strong as\r\nits adhesion to the glass.\r\n\r\nThe cohesion of liquids is further shown by the form a drop of liquid\r\ntends to take when left to itself. This is readily seen in small drops\r\nof liquids. The spherical shape of drops of water or mercury is an\r\nexample. A mixture of alcohol and water in proper proportions will just\r\nsupport olive oil within it. By carefully dropping olive oil from a\r\npipette into such a mixture, a drop of the oil, an inch or more in\r\ndiameter suspended in the liquid, may be formed. It is best to use a\r\nbottle with plane or flat sides, for if a round bottle is used, the\r\nsphere of oil will appear flattened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10 _a_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 10 _b_.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 10 _a_ AND _b_.--Surface tension of a liquid film.]\r\n\r\n=22. Surface Tension.=--The cohesion of liquids is also indicated by the\r\ntendency of films to assume the smallest possible surface. Soap bubble\r\nfilms show this readily. Fig. 10 _a_ represents a circular wire form\r\nholding a film in which floats a loop of thread. The tension of the\r\nfilm is shown in Fig. 10 _b_ by the circular form of the loop after the\r\nfilm within it has been pierced by a hot wire, Fig. 11 shows a\r\nrectangular wire form with a \"rider.\" The tension in the film draws the\r\nrider forward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The rider is drawn forward.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Surface tension causes the pointed shape.]\r\n\r\nA soap bubble takes its spherical shape because this form holds the\r\nconfined air within the smallest possible surface. A drop of liquid is\r\nspherical for the same reason. Many illustrations of the tension in\r\nfilms may be given. Users of water colors notice that a dry camel's-hair\r\nbrush is bushy. (Fig. 12 _A_). When in water it is still bushy. (Fig. 12\r\n_B_.) But when it is taken from the water and the excess is shaken from\r\nit, it is pointed as in Fig. 12 _C_. It is held to the pointed shape by\r\nthe tension of the liquid film about the brush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--A needle depresses the surface when floating.]\r\n\r\nThe surface of water acts as if covered by a film which coheres more\r\nstrongly than the water beneath it. This is shown by the fact that a\r\nsteel needle or a thin strip of metal may be floated upon the surface of\r\nwater. It is supported by the surface film. (See Fig. 13.) If the film\r\nbreaks the needle sinks. This film also supports the little water bugs\r\nseen running over the surface of a quiet pond in summer. The surface\r\nfilm is stronger in some liquids than in others. This may be shown by\r\ntaking water, colored so that it can be seen, placing a thin layer of it\r\non a white surface and dropping alcohol upon it. Wherever the alcohol\r\ndrops, the water is seen to pull away from it, leaving a bare space over\r\nwhich the alcohol has been spread. This indicates that the alcohol has\r\nthe weaker film. The _film of greasy benzine is stronger_ than the film\r\nof the pure material. If one wishes to remove a grease spot and places\r\npure benzine at the center of the spot, the stronger film of the greasy\r\nliquid will pull away from the pure benzine, and spread out, making a\r\nlarger spot than before, while if pure benzine is placed _around the\r\ngrease spot_, the greasy liquid at the center pulls away from the pure\r\nbenzine, drawing more and more to the center, where it may be wiped up\r\nand the grease entirely removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--The molecule at _A_ is held differently from\r\none within the liquid.]\r\n\r\n=23. Explanation of the Surface Film.=--Beneath the surface of a liquid\r\neach molecule is attracted by all the other molecules around it. It is\r\nattracted equally in all directions. Consequently the interior molecules\r\nmove very easily over each other in any direction. A molecule at the\r\nsurface, as at _A_, Fig. 14, is not attracted _upward_ by other liquid\r\nmolecules. Its freedom of motion is thereby hindered with the result\r\nthat a molecule at the surface behaves differently from one beneath the\r\nsurface. The surface molecules act as if they form an elastic skin or\r\nmembrane upon the liquid surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Capillary attraction in tubes.]\r\n\r\n=24. Capillarity.=--A striking action of the surface film of a liquid is\r\nseen in the rise of liquids in tubes of small bore when the liquid\r\n_wets_ them. If the liquid _does not wet_ the tube, as when mercury is\r\nplaced in glass, the liquid is depressed. It is found in general that:\r\n_Liquids rise in capillary tubes when they wet them and are depressed in\r\ntubes which they do not wet; the smaller the diameter of the tube the\r\ngreater the change of level._ (See Fig. 15.) This action is explained as\r\nfollows: The molecules of a liquid have an attraction for each other and\r\nalso for the sides of a tube. The former is called \"cohesion for\r\nitself,\" the latter is called \"adhesion for the sides of the containing\r\nvessel.\" If the cohesion for itself is greater than the adhesion for the\r\nside of the containing vessel, the liquid is pulled away from the side\r\nand is depressed. If the adhesion is greater, the liquid is elevated.\r\nThis action is called \"capillary action\" from the Latin word\r\n(_capillus_) signifying hair, since it shows best in fine hairlike\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nThere are many common illustrations of capillary action: oil rising in a\r\nwick; water rising in a towel or through clothes; ink in a blotter, etc.\r\nThe minute spaces between the fibers composing these objects act as fine\r\ntubes. If cloth is treated with a preparation which prevents water from\r\nadhering to its fibers, the material will not be wet when water is\r\npoured upon it, because the water will not run in between the fibers; a\r\nsurface film spreads over the cloth so that no water enters it.\r\n_Cravenette cloth_ has been treated in this way and hence is waterproof.\r\n\r\n     The action of this film may be shown by the following experiment.\r\n     Dip a sieve of fine copper gauze in melted paraffin, thus coating\r\n     each wire so that water will not adhere to it. Water may now be\r\n     poured into the sieve, if a piece of paper is first laid in it to\r\n     break the force of the water. On carefully removing the paper the\r\n     surface film of the water will prevent the passage of the water\r\n     through the sieve.\r\n\r\n=25. Capillary Action in Soils.=--The distribution of moisture in the\r\nsoil depends largely upon capillary action. When the soil is compact the\r\nminute spaces between the soil particles act as capillary tubes, thus\r\naiding the water to rise to the surface. As the water evaporates from\r\nthe surface more of it rises by capillary action from the damper soil\r\nbelow. Keeping the soil loose by cultivation, makes the spaces between\r\nthe particles too large for much capillary action, thus the moisture is\r\nlargely prevented from rising to the surface.\r\n\r\nIn the semi-arid regions of the West \"_dry farming_\" is successfully\r\npractised. This consists in keeping the surface covered with a \"dust\r\nmulch\" produced by frequent cultivation. In this way the moisture is\r\nkept below the surface, where it can be utilized during the hot dry\r\nsummer by the roots of growing plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Give three examples of capillary attraction found in the home. Three\r\nout of doors.\r\n\r\n18. Why does cultivation of the soil prevent rapid evaporation of water\r\nfrom the ground?\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) EVIDENCES OF MOLECULAR FORCES IN LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS\r\n\r\n=26. Solutions.=--A crystal of potassium permanganate is placed in a\r\nliter of water. It soon dissolves and on shaking the flask each portion\r\nof the liquid is seen to be colored red. The dissolving of the\r\npermanganate is an illustration of the attraction of the molecules of\r\nwater for the molecules of the permanganate. We are familiar with this\r\naction in the seasoning of food with salt and sweetening with sugar.\r\n\r\nWater will dissolve many substances, but in varying degrees, _i.e._, of\r\nsome it will dissolve much, of others, little, and some not at all.\r\nFurther, different liquids have different solvent powers. Alcohol will\r\ndissolve resin and shellac, but it will not dissolve gum arabic, which\r\nis soluble in water. Benzine dissolves grease. Beeswax is not dissolved\r\nby water, alcohol or benzine, but is soluble in turpentine.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the _temperature_ of the liquid has a marked effect\r\nupon the amount of substance that will dissolve. This is an indication\r\nthat the _motions_ of the molecules are effective in solution. It\r\nappears that dissolving a solid is in some respects similar to\r\nevaporation, and just as at higher temperatures more of the liquid\r\nevaporates, because more of the molecules will escape from the liquid\r\ninto the air above, so at higher temperatures, more molecules of a solid\r\nwill detach themselves through greater vibration and will move into the\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nFurther, just as an evaporating liquid may saturate the space above it\r\nso that any escape of molecules is balanced by those returning, so with\r\na dissolving solid, the liquid may become _saturated_ so that the\r\nsolution of more of the solid is balanced by the return of the molecules\r\nfrom the liquid to the solid condition.\r\n\r\n=27. Crystals and Crystallization.=--This return from the liquid to the\r\nsolid state, of molecules that are in solution, is especially noticeable\r\nwhen the solution is cooling or evaporating and hence is losing its\r\ncapacity to hold so much of the solid. On returning to the solid, the\r\nmolecules attach themselves in a definite manner to the solid portion,\r\nbuilding up regular solid forms. These regular forms are _crystals_. The\r\naction that forms them is called _crystallization_.\r\n\r\nEach substance seems to have its own _peculiar form of crystal_ due to\r\nthe manner in which the molecules attach themselves to those previously\r\nin place. The largest and most _symmetrical crystals are_ those in which\r\nthe molecules are deposited slowly with no disturbance of the liquid.\r\nBeautiful crystals of alum may be obtained by dissolving 25 g. of alum\r\nin 50 ccm. of hot water, hanging two or three threads in the solution\r\nand letting it stand over night. The thread fibers provide a foundation\r\nupon which crystals grow.\r\n\r\nWhen a _solution_ of a solid evaporates, the molecules of the _liquid_\r\nescape as a gas, the molecules of the _solid_ remain accumulating as\r\ncrystals. This principle has many uses: (a) sea water is purified by\r\n_evaporating the water and condensing the vapor_, which of course forms\r\npure water. (b) water is forced down to _salt_ beds where it dissolves\r\nthe salt. The brine is then raised and evaporated, leaving the salt in\r\nthe evaporating pans.\r\n\r\n     =28. Absorption of Gases by Solids and Liquids.=--If a piece of\r\n     heated charcoal is placed in a test-tube containing ammonia gas,\r\n     inverted in mercury, the ammonia is seen to disappear, the mercury\r\n     rising to take its place. The ammonia has been absorbed by the\r\n     charcoal, the gas molecules clinging closely to the solid. The\r\n     charcoal being very porous presents a large surface to the action\r\n     of the gas.\r\n\r\nThis experiment indicates that attraction exists between gas molecules\r\nand other molecules. Many porous substances have this power of absorbing\r\ngases. We have all noticed that butter has its flavor affected by\r\nsubstances placed near it.\r\n\r\nThat _liquids absorb gases_ is shown by slowly heating cold water in a\r\nbeaker. Small bubbles of air form on the sides and rise before the\r\nboiling point is reached. Ammonia gas is readily absorbed in water, the\r\nbubbles disappearing almost as soon as they escape into the water from\r\nthe end of the delivery tube. _Household ammonia_ is simply a solution\r\nof ammonia gas in water. On warming the solution of ammonia the gas\r\nbegins to pass off; thus, warming a liquid tends to drive off any gas\r\ndissolved in it.\r\n\r\n_Soda water_ is made by forcing carbon dioxide gas into water under\r\nstrong pressure. When placed in a vessel open to the air the pressure is\r\nlessened and part of the gas escapes. The dissolved gas gives the\r\ncharacteristic taste to the beverage.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. The solution of solids is increased by heating.\r\n\r\n2. The solution of gases is decreased by heating.\r\n\r\n3. Pressure increases the quantity of gas that can be dissolved in a\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n4.

Differences between Solids and Gases.=--In studying gases, it is\r\nseen that they behave as if they were composed of small particles in\r\nrapid motion, continually striking and rebounding, and separating to\r\nfill any space into which they are released. This action indicates that\r\nthere is practically no attractive force between such molecules.\r\n\r\nBetween the molecules of a solid, however, the forces of attraction are\r\nstrong, as is shown by the fact that a solid often requires a great\r\nforce to pull it apart; some, as steel and iron, show this property in a\r\nsuperlative degree, a high-grade steel rod 1 cm. in diameter requiring\r\nnearly 9 tons to pull it apart. Tests show that the breaking strengths\r\nof such rods are directly proportional to their areas of cross-section.\r\nThat is, twice the area has twice the breaking strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Elasticity of bending.]\r\n\r\n=30. Elasticity.=--Fully as important as a knowledge of the breaking\r\nstrengths of solids, is the knowledge of what happens when the forces\r\nused are not great enough to break the rods or wires.\r\n\r\n     Take a wooden rod (as a meter stick) and clamp one end to the table\r\n     top, as in Fig. 16. At the other end hang a weight. Fasten a wire\r\n     to this end so that it projects out in front of a scale. Add\r\n     successively several equal weights and note the position of the\r\n     wire each time. Remove the weights in order, noting the positions\r\n     as before. The rod will probably return to the first position.\r\n\r\nThis simple experiment illustrates a characteristic of solids: that of\r\nchanging shape when force is applied and of returning to the original\r\nshape when the force is removed. This property is called _elasticity_.\r\n\r\nTests of elasticity are made by subjecting wire of different materials\r\nbut of the same dimensions to the same tension. The one changing least\r\nis said to have the greatest _elastic force_ or elasticity. If greater\r\nforces are applied to the wire and then removed, one will finally be\r\nfound that will permanently stretch the wire so that it will not return\r\nexactly to the former length. The wire has now passed its _elastic\r\nlimit_ and has been permanently stretched.\r\n\r\nJust as there are great differences between the _elastic forces_ of\r\ndifferent substances, so there are great differences in the _limits of\r\nelasticity_. In some substances the limit is reached with slight\r\ndistortion, while others are _perfectly elastic_ even when greatly\r\nstretched. India rubber is an example of a body having _perfect_\r\nelasticity through wide limits. Glass has great _elastic force_ but its\r\n_limit_ of _elasticity_ is soon reached. Substances like India rubber\r\nmay be said to have great \"_stretchability_,\" but little elastic force.\r\nIn physics, elasticity refers to the elastic force rather than to\r\nability to endure stretching.\r\n\r\n=31. Kinds of Elasticity.=--_Elasticity may be shown in four ways_:\r\n_compression_, _bending_ or _flexure_, _extension_ or _stretching_,\r\n_twisting_ or _torsion_. The first is illustrated by squeezing a rubber\r\neraser, the second by an automobile spring, the third by the stretching\r\nof a rubber band, the fourth by the twisting and untwisting of a string\r\nby which a weight is suspended.\r\n\r\n_There are two kinds of elasticity_: (1) elasticity of form or shape;\r\n(2) elasticity of volume. Gases and liquids possess elasticity of\r\nvolume, but not of shape, while solids may have both kinds. Gases and\r\nliquids are perfectly elastic because no matter how great pressure may\r\nbe applied, as soon as the pressure is removed they regain their former\r\nvolume. No solid possesses perfect elasticity, because sooner or later\r\nthe limit of elasticity will be reached.\r\n\r\n=32. Hooke's Law.=[A]--On examining the successive movements of the end\r\nof the rod in Art. 30, we find that they are approximately equal.\r\nCarefully conducted experiments upon the elasticity of bodies have shown\r\nthat the changes in shape are _directly proportional_ to the forces\r\napplied, provided that the limit of elasticity is not reached. This\r\nrelation, discovered by Robert Hooke, is sometimes expressed as follows:\r\n\"_Within the limits of perfect elasticity, all changes of size or shape\r\nare directly proportional to the forces producing them._\"\r\n\r\n  [A] A law is a statement of a constant mode of behavior. It is\r\n  often expressed in mathematical language.\r\n\r\n=33. Molecular Forces and Molecular Motions.=--If a solid is compressed,\r\non releasing the pressure the body regains its former shape if it has\r\nnot been compressed too far. This indicates that at a given temperature\r\nthe \"molecules of a solid tend to remain at a fixed distance from each\r\nother, and resist any attempt to decrease or increase this distance.\"\r\nThis raises the question, Why does not the cohesion pull the molecules\r\ntightly together so that compression would be impossible? The reason is\r\nthat heat affects the size of solid bodies. On lowering the temperature,\r\nbodies do contract, for as soon as the temperature is lowered the\r\nvibration of the molecule is lessened. On raising the temperature the\r\nmolecules are pushed farther apart.\r\n\r\nThe size of a body, then, is the result of a balance of opposing forces.\r\nThe attractive force between the molecules pulling them together is\r\n_cohesion_, while the force which pushes them apart is due to the\r\nmotions of the molecules. Raising the temperature and thus increasing\r\nthe motion causes expansion; lowering the temperature decreases the\r\nmolecular motion and so causes contraction. If an outside force tries to\r\npull the body apart or to compress it this change of size is resisted by\r\neither cohesion or molecular motion.\r\n\r\n=34. Properties of Matter.=--Many differences in the physical properties\r\nof solids are due to differences between the cohesive force of different\r\nkinds of molecules. In some substances, the attraction is such that they\r\nmay be rolled out in very thin sheets. Gold is the best example of this,\r\nsheets being formed 1/300,000 of an inch thick. This property is called\r\n_malleability_. In other substances the cohesion permits it to be drawn\r\nout into fine threads or wire. Glass and quartz are examples of this.\r\nThis property is called _ductility_. In some, the cohesion makes the\r\nsubstance excessively _hard_, so that it is difficult to work or scratch\r\nits surface. The diamond is the hardest substance known. Some substances\r\nare _tough_, others _brittle_. These are tested by the ability to\r\nwithstand sudden shocks as the blow of a hammer.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Pressure of Liquids against Surfaces.=--The sight of a great ship,\r\nperhaps built of iron and floating on water, causes one to wonder at the\r\nforce that supports it. This same force is noticed when one pushes a\r\nlight body, as a cork, under water. It is quite evident in such a case\r\nthat a force exists sufficient to overcome the weight of the cork so\r\nthat it tends to rise to the surface. Even the weight of our bodies is\r\nso far supported by water that many persons can float.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Water forces the card against the chimney.]\r\n\r\nThe following experiment provides a means of testing this force:\r\n\r\n     If an empty can is pushed down into water, we feel at once the\r\n     force of the liquid acting against the object and tending to push\r\n     it upward. It may be noticed also that so long as the can is not\r\n     completely submerged the deeper the can is pushed into the water\r\n     the greater is the upward force exerted by the liquid.\r\n\r\n     We may test this action in various ways: a simple way is to take a\r\n     cylindrical lamp chimney, press a card against its lower end and\r\n     place it in the water in a vertical position. The force of the\r\n     water will hold the card firmly against the end of the chimney.\r\n     (See Fig. 17.) The amount of force may be tested by dropping shot\r\n     into the tube until the card drops off. At greater depths more shot\r\n     will be required, showing that the force of the water increases\r\n     with the depth. Or one may pour water into the chimney. It will\r\n     then be found that the card does not drop until the level of the\r\n     water inside the chimney is the same as on the outside. That is,\r\n     before the card will fall off, the water must stand as high within\r\n     the chimney as without no matter to what depth the lower end of the\r\n     chimney is thrust below the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n=36. Law of Liquid Pressure.=--As there is twice as much water or shot\r\nin the chimney when it is filled to a depth of 10 cm. as there is when\r\nit is filled to a depth of 5 cm. the force of the water upward on the\r\nbottom must be twice as great at a depth of 10 cm. as at a depth of 5\r\ncm. Since this reasoning will hold good for a comparison of forces at\r\nany two depths, we have the law: \"_The pressure exerted by a liquid is\r\ndirectly proportional to the depth_.\"\r\n\r\nThe amount of this force may be computed as follows: First, the card\r\nstays on the end of the tube until the _weight_ of water from above\r\nequals the force of the water from below, and second, the card remains\r\nuntil the water is at the same _height_ inside the tube as it is\r\noutside. Now if we find the weight of water at a given depth in the\r\ntube, we can determine the force of the water from below. If for\r\ninstance the chimney has an area of cross-section of 12 sq. cm. and is\r\nfilled with water to a depth of 10 cm., the volume of the water\r\ncontained will be 120 ccm. This volume of water will weigh 120 g. This\r\nrepresents then, not only the weight of the water in the tube, but also\r\nthe force of the water against the bottom. In a similar way one may\r\nmeasure the force of water against any horizontal surface.\r\n\r\n=37. Force and Pressure.=--We should now distinguish between _force_ and\r\n_pressure_. Pressure refers to the force acting against _unit area_,\r\nwhile force refers to the action against the whole surface. Thus for\r\nexample, the atmospheric _pressure_ is often given as 15 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch or as one kilogram to the square centimeter. On the other\r\nhand, the air may exert a _force_ of more than 300 pounds upon each side\r\nof the hand of a man; or a large ship may be supported by the _force_ of\r\nthousands of tons exerted by water against the bottom of the ship.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration, given in Art. 36, the upward _force_ of the water\r\nagainst the end of the tube at a depth of 10 cm. is computed as 120\r\ngrams. The _pressure_ at the _same_ depth will be 10 grams per sq. cm.\r\nWhat will be the pressure at a depth of 20 cm.? at a depth of 50 cm.? of\r\n100 cm.? Compare these answers with the law of liquid pressure in Art.\r\n36.\r\n\r\n=38. Density.=--If other liquids, as alcohol, mercury, etc., were in the\r\njar, the chimney would need filling to the same level outside, with the\r\n_same_ liquid, before the card would fall off. This brings in a factor\r\nthat was not considered before, _that of the mass[B] of a cubic\r\ncentimeter of the liquid_. This is called the _density_ of the liquid.\r\nAlcohol has a density of 0.8 g. per cubic centimeter, mercury of 13.6 g.\r\nper cubic centimeter, while water has a density of 1 g. per cubic\r\ncentimeter.\r\n\r\n  [B] The _mass_ of a body is the _amount of matter in it_, the\r\n  _weight_ is the _pull of the earth upon it_.\r\n\r\n=39. Liquid Force against Any Surface.=--To find the force exerted by a\r\nliquid against a surface we must take into consideration the area of the\r\nsurface, and the height and the =density= of the liquid above the\r\nsurface. The following law, and the formula representing it, which\r\nconcisely expresses the principle by which the force exerted by a liquid\r\nagainst any surface may be computed, should be memorized:\r\n\r\n     _The force which a liquid exerts against any surface, equals the\r\n     area of the surface, times its average depth below the surface of\r\n     the liquid, times the weight of unit volume of the liquid._\r\n\r\nOr, expressed by a formula, _F = Ahd_. In this formula, \"F\" stands for\r\n_the force which a liquid exerts against any surface_, \"A\" _the area\r\nof the surface_, \"h,\" for _the average depth (or height) of the liquid\r\npressing on the surface_, and \"d\", for _the weight of unit volume of the\r\nliquid_. This is the first illustration in this text, of the use of a\r\nformula to represent a law. Observe how accurately and concisely the law\r\nis expressed by the formula. When the formula is employed, however, we\r\nshould keep in mind the law expressed by it.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that a liquid presses not only downward and upward but\r\nsideways as well, as we see when water spurts out of a hole in the side\r\nof a vessel. Experiments have shown that at a point the pressure in a\r\nfluid is the same in all directions, hence the rule given above may be\r\napplied to the pressure of a liquid against the side of a tank, or boat,\r\nor other object, provided we are accurate in determining the _average\r\ndepth of the liquid_; The following example illustrates the use of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n     _For Example_: If the English system is used, the area of the\r\n     surface should be expressed in square feet, the depth in feet and\r\n     the weight of the liquid in pounds per cubic foot. One cubic foot\r\n     of water weighs 62.4 lbs.\r\n\r\n     Suppose that a box 3 ft. square and 4 ft. deep is full of water.\r\n     What force will be exerted by the water against the bottom and a\r\n     side?\r\n\r\n     From the law given above, the force of a liquid against a surface\r\n     equals the product of the _area_ of the surface, the _depth_ of the\r\n     liquid and its weight per unit volume, or using the formula, _F =\r\n     Ahd_. To compute the downward force against the bottom we have the\r\n     area, 9, depth, 4, and the weight 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot. 9 × 4 ×\r\n     62.4 lbs. = 2246.4 lbs. To compute the force against a side, the\r\n     area is 12, the average depth of water on the side is 2, the weight\r\n     62.4, 12 × 2 × 62.4 lbs. = 1497.6 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Pascal's Principle.=--Liquids exert pressure not only due to their\r\nown weight, but when confined, may be made to transmit pressure to\r\nconsiderable distances. This is a matter of common knowledge wherever a\r\nsystem of waterworks with connections to houses is found, as in cities.\r\nThe transmission of liquid pressure has a number of important\r\napplications. The principle underlying each of these was first\r\ndiscovered by Pascal, a French scientist of the seventeenth century.\r\nPascal's Principle, as it is called, may be illustrated as follows:\r\n\r\n     Suppose a vessel of the shape shown in Fig. 18, the upper part of\r\n     which we may assume has an area of 1 sq. cm., is filled with water\r\n     up to the level _AB_. A pressure will be exerted upon each square\r\n     centimeter of area depending upon the depth. Suppose that the\r\n     height of _AB_ above _CD_ is 10 cm., then the force upon 1 sq. cm.\r\n     of _CD_ is 10 g., or if the area of _CD_ is 16 sq. cm., it receives\r\n     a force of 160 g.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--The force increases with the depth.]\r\n\r\n     If now a cubic centimeter of water be poured upon _AB_ it will\r\n     raise the level 1 cm., or the head of water exerting pressure upon\r\n     _CD_ becomes 11 cm., or the total force in _CD_ is 16×11 g.,\r\n     _i.e._, each square centimeter of _CD_ receives an additional force\r\n     of 1 g. _Hence the force exerted on a unit area at_ _AB_ _is\r\n     transmitted to every unit area within the vessel._\r\n\r\nThe usual form in which this law is expressed is as follows: _Pressure\r\napplied to any part of a confined liquid is transmitted unchanged, in\r\nall directions, and adds the same force to all equal surfaces in contact\r\nwith the liquid_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--The force is proportional to the area.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of this principle, as Pascal himself pointed out, lies in\r\nthe fact that by its aid we are able to exert a great force upon a large\r\narea by applying a small force upon a small area of a confined liquid,\r\nboth areas being in contact with the same liquid. Thus in Fig. 19 if the\r\narea of the surface _CD_ is 2000 times the area of the surface _AB_,\r\nthen 1 lb. applied to the liquid on _AB_ will exert or sustain a force\r\nof 2000 lbs. on _CD_.\r\n\r\n=41. Hydraulic Press.=--An important application of Pascal's principle\r\nis the _hydraulic press_. See Fig. 20. It is used for many purposes\r\nwhere great force is required, as in pressing paper or cloth, extracting\r\noil from seeds, lifting heavy objects, etc. Many high school pupils have\r\nbeen seated in a _hydraulic chair_ used by a dentist or barber. This\r\nchair is a modified hydraulic press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Cross-section of a hydraulic press.]\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic press contains two movable pistons, _P_ and _p_ (see Fig.\r\n20). The larger of these, _P_, has a cross-sectional area that may be\r\n100 or 1000 times that of the smaller. The smaller one is moved up and\r\ndown by a lever; on each upstroke, liquid is drawn in from a reservoir,\r\nwhile each down-stroke forces some of the liquid into the space about\r\nthe large piston. Valves at _V_ and _V´_ prevent the return of the\r\nliquid. If the area of _P_ is 1,000 times that of _p_, then the force\r\nexerted by _P_ is 1000 times the force employed in moving _p_. On the\r\nother hand, since the liquid moved by the small piston is distributed\r\nover the area of the large one, the latter will move only 1/1000 as far\r\nas does the small piston. The relation between the motions of the two\r\npistons and the forces exerted by them may be stated concisely as\r\nfollows: The _motions_ of the two _pistons_ of the hydraulic press are\r\ninversely proportional to the forces exerted by them. The\r\n_cross-sectional areas_ of the two pistons are, on the other hand,\r\ndirectly proportional to the forces exerted by them.\r\n\r\nAn application of Pascal's principle often employed in cities is the\r\nhydraulic elevator. In this device a long plunger or piston extends\r\ndownward from the elevator car into a cylinder sunk into the earth,\r\nsometimes to a depth of 300 ft. Water forced into this cylinder pushes\r\nthe piston upward and when the water is released from the cylinder the\r\npiston descends.\r\n\r\n     Fig. 21 represents another form of hydraulic elevator, where the\r\n     cylinder and piston are at one side of the elevator shaft. In this\r\n     type, to raise the elevator, water is admitted to the cylinder\r\n     pushing the piston downward.\r\n\r\n=42. Artesian Wells.=--Sometimes a porous stratum containing water in\r\nthe earth's crust is inclined. Then if there are impervious strata (see\r\nFig. 22), both above and below the water-bearing one, and the latter\r\ncomes to the surface so that rain may fill it, a well sunk to the\r\nwater-bearing stratum at a point where it is below the surface will\r\nusually give an artesian well, that is, one in which the water rises to\r\nor above the surface. Many are found in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--A hydraulic freight elevator.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Conditions producing an artesian well.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--A standpipe.]\r\n\r\n=43. Standpipes and Air Cushions.=--Many who have lived in cities where\r\nwater is pumped into houses under pressure know that the water pressure\r\nis changed when several faucets are opened at the same time. Again, if\r\nseveral persons are using a hose for sprinkling, the pressure may be\r\nlessened so as to be insufficient to force the water above the first\r\nfloor. In order to allow for these changes some flexibility or spring\r\nmust be introduced somewhere into the water-pipe system. Water is\r\nnearly incompressible and if no means were employed to take care of the\r\npressure changes, the sudden stopping and starting of the flow would\r\ncause serious jars and start leaks in the pipes. Two common devices for\r\ncontrolling sudden changes in the water pressure are the _standpipe_ and\r\nthe _air cushion_.\r\n\r\n     The _standpipe_ is simply a large vertical tube connected to the\r\n     water mains from which and into which water readily flows. When\r\n     many faucets are opened the water lowers; when most faucets are\r\n     closed the water rises, giving a simple automatic control of the\r\n     surplus water and a supply of water for a short time during a\r\n     shut-down of the pumps. Standpipes are often used in towns and\r\n     small cities. Fig. 23 represents the standpipe at Jerome, Idaho.\r\n\r\n     The _air cushion_ (Fig. 24) is a metal pipe or dome filled with air\r\n     attached to a water pipe where sudden changes in pressure are to be\r\n     controlled. At many faucets in a city water system such an air\r\n     cushion is employed. It contains air; this, unlike water, is easily\r\n     compressible and the confined air when the tap is suddenly closed\r\n     receives and checks gradually the rush of water in the pipe. Even\r\n     with an air cushion, the \"pound\" of the water in the pipe when a\r\n     tap is suddenly closed is often heard. If air cushions were not\r\n     provided, the \"water hammer\" would frequently crack or break the\r\n     pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--The short pipe above the faucet contains air\r\nforming an air cushion.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Using the result in problem 9, what \"head\" of water will produce a\r\npressure of 10 lbs. per square inch? 100 lbs. per square inch?\r\n\r\n11. From the result in 9, 100 ft. of \"head\" of water will produce what\r\npressure? 1000 ft. of \"head?\"\r\n\r\n12. If the diameter of the pump piston in a hydraulic press is 2 cm. and\r\nthat of the press piston 50 cm. what will be the force against the\r\nlatter if the former is pushed down with a force of 40 kg.?\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\n=44. A Body Supported by a Liquid.=--Among the applications of the force\r\nexerted by a liquid upon a surface, Archimedes' Principle is one of the\r\nmost important.\r\n\r\nMost persons have noted that a body placed in water is partly or wholly\r\nsupported by the force of the water upon it. A stone held by a cord and\r\nlowered into water is felt to have a part of its weight supported,\r\nwhile a piece of cork or wood is wholly supported and floats.\r\n\r\nThe human body is almost entirely supported in water, in fact, many\r\npeople can easily float in water. It was the consideration of this fact\r\nthat led the Greek philosopher Archimedes to discover and state the\r\nprinciple that describes the supporting of a body in a liquid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Theoretical proof of Archimedes' principle.]\r\n\r\n=45. Archimedes' Principle.=--\"_A body immersed in a liquid is pushed up\r\nby a force equal to the weight of the liquid that it displaces._\" The\r\nproof for this law is simply demonstrated. Suppose a cube, _abcd_, is\r\nimmersed in water (Fig. 25). The upward force on _cd_ is equal to the\r\nweight of a column of water equal to _cdef_. (See Art. 39.) The downward\r\nforce upon the top of the cube is equal to the weight of the column of\r\nwater _abef_. Then the net upward force upon the cube, that is, the\r\nupward force upon the bottom less the downward force upon the top, or\r\nthe buoyant force exerted by the liquid is exactly equal to the weight\r\nof the displaced water _abcd_.\r\n\r\n=46. Law of Floating Bodies.=--This same reasoning may be applied to any\r\nliquid and to any body immersed to any depth below the surface of the\r\nliquid. If the body weighs more than the displaced liquid it will sink.\r\nIf it weighs less than the displaced liquid it will float or rise in the\r\nwater. A block of wood rises out of the water in which it floats until\r\nits own weight just equals the weight of the water it displaces. From\r\nthis we have the law of floating bodies.\r\n\r\n_A floating body displaces its own weight of the liquid in which it\r\nfloats._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--A floating body displaces its own weight of\r\nwater.]\r\n\r\nTo test the law of floating bodies, take a rod of light wood 1 cm.\r\nsquare and 30 cm. long (Fig. 26). Bore out one end and fill the opening\r\nwith lead and seal with paraffin so that the rod will float vertically\r\nwhen placed in water. Mark upon one side of the rod a centimeter scale,\r\nand dip the rod in hot paraffin to make it waterproof. Now find the\r\nweight of the stick in grams and note the depth to which it sinks in\r\nwater in centimeters. Compute the weight of the displaced water. It will\r\nequal the weight of the rod.\r\n\r\n=47. Applications of Archimedes' Principle.= There are numerous\r\napplications of Archimedes' Principle and the law of floating bodies.\r\n\r\n     =(a) To Find the Weight of a Floating Body: Problem.=--A boat 20\r\n     ft. long and with an average width of 6 ft. sinks to an average\r\n     depth of 3 ft. in the water. Find the weight of the boat. What\r\n     weight of cargo will sink it to an average depth of 5 ft.?\r\n\r\n     =Solution.=--The volume of the water displaced is 20 × 6 × 3 cu.\r\n     ft. = 360 cu. ft. Since 1 cu. ft. of water weighs 62.4 lbs., 360 ×\r\n     62.4 lbs. = 22,464 lbs., the weight of water displaced. By the law\r\n     of floating bodies this is equal to the weight of the boat. When\r\n     loaded the volume of water displaced is 20 ft. × 6 × 5 ft. which\r\n     equal 600 cu. ft. 600 × 62.4 lbs. = 37,440 lbs. This is the weight\r\n     of the water displaced when loaded. 37,440 lbs. - 22,464 lbs. =\r\n     14,976 lbs., the weight of the cargo.\r\n\r\n     =(b) To Find the Volume of an Immersed Solid: Problem.=--A stone\r\n     weighs 187.2 lbs. in air and appears to weigh 124.8 lbs. in water.\r\n     What is its volume?\r\n\r\n     =Solution.=--187.2 lbs. - 124.8 lbs. = 62.4 lbs., the buoyant force\r\n     of the water. By Archimedes' Principle, this equals the weight of\r\n     the displaced water which has a volume of 1 cu. ft. which is\r\n     therefore the volume of the stone.\r\n\r\n     =(c) To Find the Density of a Body:= The density of a body is\r\n     defined as the mass of unit volume.\r\n\r\n     We can easily find the mass of a body by weighing it, but the\r\n     volume is often impossible to obtain by measurements, especially of\r\n     irregular solids.\r\n\r\nArchimedes' Principle, however, provides a method of finding the volume\r\nof a body accurately by weighing it first in air and then in water (Fig.\r\n27), the apparent loss in weight being equal to the weight of the\r\ndisplaced water. One needs only to find the volume of water having the\r\nsame weight as the loss of weight to find the volume of the body.\r\n\r\nIf the metric system is used, 1 ccm. of water weighs 1 g., and the\r\nvolume is numerically the same as the loss of weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--A method of weighing a body under water.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

How\r\nmuch water will a man who weighs 150 lbs. displace when diving? How much\r\nwhen floating?\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) DENSITY AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY\r\n\r\n=48. Density.=--The density of a substance is often used as a test of\r\nits purity. Archimedes in testing King Hiero's crown to find out if it\r\nwere made of pure gold determined first its density. It is by such tests\r\nthat the purity of milk, of alcohol, of gold, and a great variety of\r\nsubstances is often determined.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of methods of finding density is of value to everyone and\r\nshould be included in the education of every student. _The density of a\r\nsubstance is the mass of unit volume of the substance._ In the metric\r\nsystem, for example, the density of a substance is the mass in grams per\r\n1 ccm. Taking water, 1 ccm. weighs 1 gr. or its density is therefore 1\r\ng. to the cubic centimeter. A cubic centimeter of aluminium weighs 2.7\r\ng. Its density therefore is 2.7 g. per ccm.\r\n\r\n=49. Specific Gravity.=--_Specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of\r\nany volume of a substance to the weight of an equal volume of water._\r\nIts meaning is not quite the same as that of density, since specific\r\ngravity is always a _ratio_, _i.e._, an _abstract_ number, as 2.7.\r\nDensity of a substance is a _concrete_ number, as 2.7 grams per ccm. In\r\nthe metric system the density of water is one gram per cubic centimeter,\r\ntherefore we have:\r\n\r\nDensity (g. per ccm.) = (numerically) specific gravity.\r\n\r\nIn the English system, the density of water is 62.4 pounds per cubic\r\nfoot, therefore in this system we have:\r\n\r\nDensity (lbs. per cu. ft.) = (numerically) 62.4 × sp. gr.\r\n\r\n=50. Methods for Finding Density and Specific Gravity=\r\n\r\n=(a) Regular Solids.=--Solids of regular shapes such as cubes, spheres,\r\netc., whose volumes may be readily found by measurement, may be weighed.\r\nThe mass divided by the volume gives the density, or _D = Mμ/v_.\r\n\r\n=(b) Irregular Solids.=--with these the volume cannot be found by\r\nmeasurement but may be obtained by Archimedes' Principle. Weigh the\r\nsolid first in the air and then in water. The apparent loss of weight\r\nequals the weight of the equal volume of water displaced. From this the\r\nvolume may be found. And then the\r\n\r\ndensity equals mass/volume; the specific gravity =\r\n\r\nwt. in air / wt. of equal volume of water = wt. in air / ((wt. in air) -\r\n(wt. in water))\r\n\r\n                  mass\r\n  density equals ------; the specific gravity =\r\n                 volume\r\n\r\n           wt. in air                        wt. in air\r\n  ----------------------------  =  -----------------------------\r\n  wt. of equal volume of water     ((wt. in air) - (wt. in water))\r\n\r\n=(c) Solids Lighter than Water.=--This will require a sinker to hold the\r\nbody under water. Weigh the solid in air (_w_). Weigh the sinker in\r\nwater (_s_). Attach the sinker to the solid and weigh both in water\r\n(w´). The specific gravity equals\r\n\r\n     (wt. of solid in air)/(loss in wt. of solid in water) or _w/((w +\r\n     s) - w´)_\r\n\r\n       wt. of solid in air                    _w_\r\n   ---------------------------   or     ------------\r\n  loss of wt. of solid in water         (_w + s_) - _w´_\r\n\r\nThe apparent loss of weight of the solid is equal to the sum of its\r\nweight in air plus the weight of the sinker in water, less the combined\r\nweight of both in water.\r\n\r\n=(d) The Density of a Liquid by a Hydrometer.=--One may also easily find\r\nthe density of any liquid by Archimedes' Principle. If one takes the rod\r\ndescribed in Art. 46, and places it in water, the number of cubic\r\ncentimeters of water it displaces indicates its weight in grams. On\r\nplacing the rod in another liquid in which it floats, it will of course\r\ndisplace its own weight and the height to which the liquid rises on the\r\nscale gives the volume. By dividing the _weight_ of the rod as shown by\r\nits position in _water_ by the _volume_ of the _liquid_ displaced we\r\nobtain the density of the liquid. Commercial hydrometers for testing the\r\ndensity of milk, alcohol and other liquids are made of glass of the form\r\nshown in Fig. 28. The long narrow stem permits small differences in\r\nvolume to be noticed, hence they are more accurate than the rod\r\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph. For convenience this rod contains\r\na paper scale, so that when the height of the liquid on the stem is\r\nnoted, the density is read at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--A hydrometer used to find the density of a\r\nliquid.]\r\n\r\n=Density of Liquids by Loss of Weight.= Weigh a piece of glass in air\r\n(_W_{a}_), in water (_W_{w}_), and in the liquid to be tested (_W_{l}_).\r\n\r\nThen (_W_{a}_ - _W_{w}_)gives the weight of the water displaced.\r\n\r\nAnd (_W_{a}_ - _W_{l}_) gives the weight of the liquid displaced.\r\n\r\nHence, (_W_{a}_ - _W_{l}_)/(_W_{a}_ - _W_{w}_) equals the specific\r\ngravity of the liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Weight of Air.=--It is said that savages are unaware of the\r\npresence of _air_. They feel the _wind_ and hear and see it moving the\r\nleaves and branches of the trees, but of air itself they have little\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nTo ordinary observers, it seems to have no weight, and to offer little\r\nresistance to bodies passing through it. That it has weight may be\r\nreadily shown as follows: (See Fig. 29.) If a hollow metal sphere, or a\r\nglass flask, provided with tube and stopcock, be weighed when the\r\nstopcock is open, and then after the air has been exhausted from it by\r\nan air pump, a definite loss of weight is noticeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Proof that air has weight.]\r\n\r\nIf the volume of the sphere is known and it is well exhausted of air, a\r\nfair approximation of the weight of air may be obtained. Under\r\n\"_standard conditions_,\" which means _at the freezing temperature_ and a\r\nbarometric pressure of 76 cm., a liter of air weighs 1.293 g. while 12\r\ncu. ft. of air weigh approximately 1 lb.\r\n\r\n=52. Pressure of Air.=--Since air has weight it may be supposed to exert\r\npressure like a liquid. That it does so may be shown in a variety of\r\nways.\r\n\r\nIf a plunger fitting tightly in a glass cylinder be drawn upward, while\r\nthe lower end of the tube is under water, the water will rise in the\r\ntube (Fig. 30). The common explanation of this is that the water rises\r\nbecause of \"suction.\" The philosophers of the ancient Greeks explained\r\nit by saying that \"nature abhors a vacuum,\" and therefore the water\r\nrises. Neither explanation is correct. It was found in 1640 that water\r\nwould not rise in a pump more than 32 ft. despite the fact that a vacuum\r\nwas maintained above the water. Galileo was applied to for an\r\nexplanation. He said, \"evidently nature's horror of a vacuum does not\r\nextend above 32 ft.\" Galileo began tests upon \"the power of a vacuum\"\r\nbut dying left his pupil Torricelli to continue the experiment.\r\nTorricelli reasoned that if water would rise 32 ft., then mercury, which\r\nis 13.6 times as dense as water, would rise about 1/13 as much. To test\r\nthis, he performed the following famous experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Air pressure forces the liquid up the tube.]\r\n\r\n=53. Torricelli's Experiment (1643).=--Take a glass tube about 3 ft.\r\nlong, sealed at one end, and fill it with mercury. Close the end with\r\nthe finger and invert, placing the end closed by the finger under\r\nmercury in a dish (Fig. 31). Remove the finger and the mercury sinks\r\nuntil the top of the mercury is about 30 in. above the level of the\r\nmercury in the dish. Torricelli concluded that the rise of liquids in\r\nexhausted tubes is due to the pressure of the atmosphere acting on the\r\nsurface of the mercury in the dish.\r\n\r\nTo test this, place the tube with its mercury upon the plate of an air\r\npump and place a tubulated bell jar over the apparatus so that the tube\r\nprojects through a tightly fitting stopper. (See Fig. 32.) If the air\r\npressure is the cause of the rise of mercury in the tube, on removing\r\nthe air from the bell jar the mercury should fall in the tube. This is\r\nseen to happen as soon as the pump is started. It is difficult to remove\r\nall the air from the receiver so the mercury rarely falls to the same\r\nlevel in the tube as in the dish. A small tube containing mercury is\r\noften attached to air pumps to indicate the degree of exhaustion. Such\r\ntubes are called _manometers_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Torricelli's experiment.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--The mercury drops as the air is removed.]\r\n\r\n=54. The Amount of Atmospheric Pressure.=--Torricelli's experiment\r\nenables us to compute readily the pressure of the atmosphere, since it\r\nis the atmospheric pressure that balances the column of mercury in the\r\ntube. By Pascal's Law, the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of\r\nthe mercury in the dish is transmitted as an exactly equal pressure on\r\nthe mercury column in the tube at the same level as the mercury\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nThis pressure, due to the air, must balance the weight of the column of\r\nmercury in the tube. It therefore equals the weight of the column of\r\nmercury of unit cross-section. The average height of the column of\r\nmercury at sea-level is 76 cm. Since the weight of 1 cc. of mercury is\r\n13.6 grams, the pressure inside the tube at the level of the surface of\r\nthe mercury in the dish is equal to 1 × 76 × 13.6 or 1033.6 g. per\r\nsquare centimeter. Therefore the _atmospheric pressure_ on the surface\r\nof the mercury in the dish is 1033.6 g. per square centimeter,\r\napproximately _1 kg. per square centimeter or 15 lbs. per square inch_.\r\n\r\n=55. Pascal's Experiment.=--Pascal tested in another way the action of\r\natmospheric pressure upon the column of mercury by requesting his\r\nbrother-in-law, Perrier, who lived near a mountain, to try the\r\nexperiment on its top. Perrier found that on ascending 1000 meters the\r\nmercury fell 8 cm. in the tube. Travelers, surveyors, and aviators\r\nfrequently determine the altitude above sea-level by reading the\r\nbarometer, an ascent of 11 meters giving a fall of about 1 mm. in the\r\nmercury column, or 0.1 in. for every 90 ft. of ascent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--A standard barometer.]\r\n\r\n_56. The Barometer._--The modern barometer (Fig. 33), consists of a\r\nTorricellian tube properly mounted. Reading a barometer consists in\r\naccurately reading the height of the mercury column. This height varies\r\nfrom 75 to 76.5 cm. or 29 to 30 in. in localities not far from the\r\nsea-level. The atmospheric pressure varies because of disturbances in\r\nthe atmosphere. It is found that these disturbances of the atmosphere\r\npass across the country from west to east in a somewhat regular manner,\r\nhence a series of readings of the barometer may give reliable\r\ninformation of the movement of these disturbances and so assist in\r\nforecasting the weather. The weather Bureau has observations taken at\r\nthe same moment at various stations over the country. These observations\r\nform the basis for the daily forecast of the weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--An aneroid barometer]\r\n\r\n     Another form of barometer in common use is the _Aneroid Barometer_\r\n     (Fig. 34). Its essential parts are a cylindrical air-tight box with\r\n     an elastic corrugated cover. Inside the box is a partial vacuum.\r\n     This makes the cover very sensitive to slight changes of pressure.\r\n     The motion of the top of the box is conveyed by a series of levers\r\n     to an indicating hand which moves over a dial. This barometer can\r\n     be made so sensitive as to indicate the change of air pressure from\r\n     a table top to the floor. It is much used by travelers, explorers,\r\n     surveying parties and aviators, since the mercurial barometer is\r\n     inconvenient to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. _Weight_ and _Pressure_ of air in English and metric units.

Explain the action of the modern drinking fountain (Fig. 36).\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) COMPRESSIBILITY AND EXPANSIBILITY OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n=57. Effect of Pressure on Liquids and Gases.=--Both classes of fluids,\r\nliquids and gases, have many characteristics in common. Both are\r\ncomposed of molecules that move freely; hence both _flow_. At any point\r\nwithin a fluid the _pressure is the same in all directions_. Archimedes'\r\nPrinciple applies, therefore, to both liquids and gases.\r\n\r\nWe now come to an important _difference_ between liquids and gases.\r\n_Liquids_ are _practically incompressible_. \"So much so, that if water\r\nis subjected to a pressure of 3000 kg. per sq. cm., its volume is\r\nreduced only about one-tenth.\" Gases show a very different behavior from\r\nliquids on being subjected to pressure. They may readily be compressed\r\nto a small fraction of their volume as is noticed on inflating a\r\npneumatic tire. A gas has also the _ability to spring back_ to a larger\r\nvolume as soon as the pressure is released, as when a cork is driven\r\nfrom a pop gun. Not only is compressed air able to expand, but air\r\nunder ordinary conditions will expand if it is released in a space where\r\nthe pressure is less.\r\n\r\nHollow bodies, animals and plants, are not crushed by atmospheric\r\npressure, because the air and gases contained within exert as much force\r\noutward as the air exerts inward.\r\n\r\n=58. Boyle's Law.=--The relation between the volume and pressure of a\r\ngas was first investigated by Robert Boyle in the seventeenth century.\r\nThe experiment by which he first discovered the law or the relation\r\nbetween the volume and the pressure of a gas is briefly described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37 _a_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 37 _b_.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 37 _a_ AND 37 _b_.--Boyle's law apparatus.]\r\n\r\n     A glass tube is bent in the form of the capital letter J, the short\r\n     arm being closed. A little mercury is poured in to cover the bend.\r\n     (See Fig. 37 _a_.) Since the mercury is at the _same level in both\r\n     arms_, the pressure in (_A_) is the same as in (_B_). Mercury is\r\n     now poured into (_A_) until it stands in the long tube at a height\r\n     above that in (B) which is equal to the height of the mercury\r\n     column of the barometer. (See Fig. 37 _b_.) The air in (_BC_) is\r\n     now under a pressure of two atmospheres (one atmosphere is due to\r\n     the mercury column). On measurement the air in (_BC_) will be found\r\n     to have just one-half of its original volume.\r\n\r\nThus doubling the pressure to which a gas is subjected reduces its\r\nvolume to one-half. Tripling the pressure, reduces the volume to\r\none-third and so on.\r\n\r\nCareful experiments reveal the following law: _The volume of a given\r\nmass of gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the\r\npressure to which it is subjected_.\r\n\r\nThis law is often expressed mathematically. _P/P´ = V´/V_, or _PV =\r\nP´V´_. Since doubling the pressure reduces the volume one-half, it\r\ndoubles the density. Tripling the pressure triples the density. We\r\ntherefore have _P/P´ = D/D´_ or the density of a gas directly\r\nproportional to its pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Height and density of the air.]\r\n\r\n=59. Height of the Atmosphere.=--From its properties of _compression_\r\nand _expansion_, the air varies in density and pressure as one ascends\r\nin it. At a height of 3 miles the pressure is reduced to about one-half.\r\nThis is an indication that one-half of the air is below this level.\r\nBalloonists have gone to a height of 7 miles, Glaser and Coxwell in\r\nEngland in 1862 and Berson in France in 1901. The atmosphere has been\r\nexplored to a height of 30,500 meters (18.95 miles) by sending up\r\nself-registering barometers in small balloons which burst at great\r\naltitudes. A parachute protects the instruments from breakage from too\r\nrapid fall. This height of 30,500 meters was reached by a balloon sent\r\nup by William R. Blair, at Huron, South Dakota, September 1, 1910.\r\n\r\nAt a height of 35 miles, the density is estimated at 1/30,000 of its\r\nvalue at sea-level. (See Fig. 38.) It is believed that some rarefied air\r\nexists for a considerable distance above this point, some estimates\r\nplacing the extent at 100 miles, and others from 200 to 500 miles.\r\nEvidences of some air at such heights are shown by: (a) the height at\r\nwhich meteors first appear, (b) the height of the Aurora Borealis, and\r\n(c), the distance that the sun is below the horizon when the last traces\r\nof color disappear from the sky in the evening.\r\n\r\nAlthough the exact limits of the atmosphere are unknown, the weight of a\r\ncolumn of air 1 sq. cm. in cross-section, and extending _upward as high\r\nas the atmosphere_, may be accurately computed. For this column of air\r\nexactly balances the column of mercury in the tube of the barometer.\r\n\r\nBelow sea-level, the air increases rapidly in density and it is\r\nestimated that at a depth of 35 miles, the density of the air would be a\r\nthousand times that at the earth's surface, or more than that of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Increasing the pressure increases the amount of a gas that will be\r\nabsorbed by a liquid? Explain this. Have you ever observed this fact?\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\n3. If a toy balloon containing 2000 ccm. of gas at the earth's surface\r\nwhere the barometer reading is 76 cm., rises to an elevation where the\r\nbarometer reads 54 cm., the balloon will tend to expand to what volume?\r\nExplain. Will it attain this volume?\r\n\r\n4. If a gas is compressed, it changes in temperature. How do you explain\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n5. What change in temperature will occur when compressed air is allowed\r\nto expand? Explain.\r\n\r\n6. Air blowing up a mountain side has its pressure lessened as it\r\napproaches the top. How will this affect the temperature? Why? What may\r\nresult from this change in temperature? Explain.\r\n\r\n7.

Explain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--The air pump.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) PNEUMATIC APPLIANCES\r\n\r\n=60. The Air Pump.=--The air pump is used to remove air or other gases\r\nfrom a closed vessel. It was invented about 1650 by Otto Von Guericke,\r\nburgomaster of Magdeburg, Germany. One form of air pump is shown in\r\nFig. 39. _C_ is a cylinder within which slides a tightly fitting piston.\r\n_R_ is the vessel from which the air is to be exhausted. _r_ and _u_ are\r\nvalves opening upward. The action of the pump is as follows:\r\n\r\nOn pushing the piston down, the air in _C_ is compressed. This opens\r\nvalve _r_ allowing the confined air to escape above the piston. The\r\npiston is then raised making the space in _C_ a partial vacuum. The\r\npressure in _R_ now being greater than in _C_, _u_ is pushed up and the\r\nair from _R_ rushes into _C_, until the pressure is equalized. On\r\npushing down the piston again, valve _u_ closes and the process is\r\nrepeated until the pressure in _R_ is no longer able to raise the valve\r\n_u_. Some air pumps are so constructed that the valves are opened and\r\nclosed automatically by the movement of the piston. With these pumps a\r\nhigher degree of rarefaction can be obtained.\r\n\r\nAir is often partially exhausted from receivers or vessels by the use of\r\na filter pump or _aspirator_. A stream of water flowing through a\r\nconstriction causes a reduced pressure, draws in air and carries it\r\naway, and thus produces a partial vacuum. See Fig. 40 for a section of\r\nthe device.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--An aspirator.]\r\n\r\n=61. The Condensing Pump.=--This is like the exhaust pump except that\r\nits valves are reversed. It is used in compressing illuminating gases\r\ninto cylinders for use in lighting vehicles, stereopticons, Pintsch\r\nlights, gas light buoys, etc., and also for compressing air to operate\r\nair brakes, pneumatic hammers and drills, and for other uses.\r\n\r\nThe common condensing pump is the kind used for inflating tires. (See\r\nFig. 41.) In this, a loosely fitting metal piston is attached to a disc\r\nof leather somewhat larger than the cylinder. This device is called a\r\n_cup valve_. On raising the piston, air rushes in from the top past the\r\nvalve, but on pushing the piston down, the valve is pressed tightly\r\nagainst the sides of the cylinder and prevents the escape of any air.\r\nThe compressed air pushes open a valve on the tire and enters it. This\r\nvalve closes as soon as the pressure is lessened from outside. It is\r\nwell to notice in all of these pumps that _two_ valves are used. One\r\nholds the air already secured while the other opens for a new supply.\r\nBoth valves are never open at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Condensing pump used in inflating tires.]\r\n\r\n=62. Water Pumps.--The Common Lift Pump.= This, the simplest pump for\r\nraising water, consists of a cylinder _C_ (Fig. 42) connected by a pipe\r\n_R_ to a supply of water as a cistern or well. A valve opening upward is\r\nplaced at the bottom of the cylinder over the entrance to the pipe. In\r\nthe cylinder is a tightly fitting piston connected by a rod to a lever\r\nfor ease in action. The piston contains a valve opening upward. In\r\noperating this pump water is usually first poured into the cylinder to\r\n\"prime\" it. This helps to close the valves and prevents air leaking past\r\nthem. When the piston is lowered the lower valve closes, the air in the\r\ncylinder being compressed pushes the upper valve open and passes above\r\nthe piston. On raising the piston the upper valve closes. This forms a\r\npartial vacuum in the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe air pressing on the surface of the water below forces the water and\r\nair that may be in the tube upward through the lower valve to fill this\r\npartial vacuum.\r\n\r\nWhen the cylinder becomes filled with water, this is lifted out on the\r\nup-stroke, whence its name, \"lift pump.\" Since the atmospheric pressure\r\nat sea-level can only support a column of water about 34 ft. high, the\r\nlower valve must be within this distance of the water surface. In actual\r\npractice the limit is about 27 ft. In deeper wells, the cylinder and\r\nvalves are placed so that they are within 25 or 27 ft. of the surface of\r\nthe water in the well, a long piston rod reaching above the surface of\r\nthe ground and connected to a pump handle operates the piston. A\r\ndischarge pipe extends from the cylinder to the surface of the ground\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--The common lift pump.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--A force pump with an air chamber (_A_).]\r\n\r\n=63. The Force Pump.=--The force pump is used to deliver water under\r\npressure either for spraying or to an elevated reservoir. The piston is\r\nsolid, the second valve being placed at the entrance of the discharge\r\npipe. (See Fig. 43.) The action is the same as that of the lift pump,\r\nwith this exception; the piston in its down stroke forces the water out\r\nthrough the discharge pipe, the velocity depending upon the pressure\r\nexerted.\r\n\r\nA force pump is usually provided with an air chamber which is connected\r\nwith the discharge pipe. On the down stroke of the piston, water is\r\nforced into the air chamber. This compresses the air it contains. The\r\ncompressed air reacts and exerts pressure on the water forcing it out in\r\na steady stream.\r\n\r\nForce pumps are used in deep wells, being placed at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe pumps used in city water works, fire engines, and all steam pumps,\r\nare force pumps. (See Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--A steam pump used on a fire engine.]\r\n\r\n=64. The Siphon.=--The siphon is a tube used to convey a liquid from one\r\nlevel over an elevation to a lower level by atmospheric pressure. It is\r\nused to remove liquids from tanks or vessels that have no opening at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe siphon cannot be completely understood until one has mastered the\r\nlaws of the flow of liquids. The following is offered as an incomplete\r\nexplanation of its behavior. Consider the siphon to be full of water\r\nand closed at _d_ (Fig. 45). Atmospheric pressure on _a_ will hold the\r\nsiphon full if _ab_ does not exceed 34 feet. If _d_ is opened the water\r\nfalls out with a speed equal to that acquired in falling from the level\r\nof _a_ to that of _d_. This speed is acquired by all the water in the\r\nsiphon and results in a drop in pressure throughout it. The pressure at\r\n_a_ inside the siphon becomes less than the pressure at the same level\r\noutside as soon as the water starts flowing. The water in the vessel\r\nthen flows into the siphon and out at _d_. This flow continues as long\r\nas there is a fall from the free surface of the water in the vessel to\r\nthe outlet at _d_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Cross-section of a siphon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--The Cartesian diver.]\r\n\r\n=65. The Cartesian Diver.=--This is a device which illustrates at the\r\nsame time transmission of pressure by liquids, Archimedes' principle,\r\nand compressibility of gases. It was invented by Des Cartes (1596-1650).\r\nAs ordinarily made, it is a hollow glass image with a small opening in\r\nthe foot. It contains air and water in such amounts that the average\r\ndensity of image and contents is slightly less than that of water. It is\r\nplaced in a tall glass jar filled with water and covered with tightly\r\nstretched rubber tissue. (See Fig. 46.) By pressing on the rubber cover\r\nthe diver may be made to sink, since the air and water transmit the\r\npressure on the cover which compresses the air inside the figure\r\nadmitting some water to it, thus making the diver more dense than\r\nwater. By varying the pressure it can be made to sink, rise, or remain\r\nstationary at will.[D] A small vial can be used instead of the image.\r\n\r\n  [D] The position of a submarine in or under water is controlled in\r\n  a similar manner.\r\n\r\n=66. Hydraulic Ram.=--The hydraulic ram (see Fig. 47) is an automatic\r\ndevice that is much used for raising water from springs to houses\r\nlocated on higher ground. Water flows through the pipe _A_ through the\r\nopening at _B_. The pressure closes the valve at _B_. The increased\r\npressure in the pipe due to the closing of _B_ opens the valve _C_ and\r\nsome of the water flows into the air chamber _D_. This reduces the\r\npressure against the valve _B_ so that it drops and allows a little\r\nwater to escape. Just as this happens, valve _C_ closes. The pressure in\r\nthe pipe then closes _B_ and forces water past _C_. This action being\r\ncontinually repeated, the air in _D_ becomes so compressed that it has\r\nelastic force enough to raise the water in a steady stream to a height\r\nof many feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Cross-section of a hydraulic ram.]\r\n\r\n=67. The Balloon.=--Since air is a fluid, Archimedes' principle applies\r\nto it as well as to liquids. Therefore any object in the air is lifted\r\nup by a force equal to the weight of the air it displaces. The object\r\nwill rise, if it weighs less than this displaced air and will continue\r\nto rise until both weights are equal.\r\n\r\n_The Balloon_ (Fig. 48) rises because it weighs less than the air it\r\ndisplaces, and therefore it is pushed up by the heavier air, the\r\n\"lifting power\" being the difference between its weight and that of the\r\nair displaced. The neck at the bottom is left open to allow for\r\nexpansion of the gas. When the aeronaut wishes to descend, he opens a\r\nvalve at the top allowing some of the gas to escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Winner of international championship race,\r\nParis, 1913.]\r\n\r\n_Hydrogen_ is the lightest gas, weighing 0.09 kg. per cubic meter, and\r\nso gives the greatest lifting power, but as it is expensive to make,\r\ncoal gas, density 0.75 kg. per cubic meter, is ordinarily employed.\r\nHelium has recently been used to fill military balloons because it\r\ncannot be set on fire.\r\n\r\n_The Parachute_ (Fig. 49) is an umbrella-shaped device for use in\r\ndescending from a balloon. After falling a few seconds it opens, the\r\nlarge surface exposed to the air causing it to descend slowly. The hole\r\nin the top keeps the parachute upright by allowing the air to escape\r\nthrough it, thus relieving the pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--A parachute.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Cross-section of a Westinghouse air brake.]\r\n\r\n=68. The Air Brake.=--Compressed air is used to do work in many\r\nmachines, such as pneumatic drills, hammers, and air brakes. The\r\nWestinghouse air brake (Fig. 50) uses air at a pressure of about 70 lbs.\r\nto the square inch. The essential parts as shown are a reservoir _R_,\r\nthe brake cylinder _C_ and a triple valve _V_, placed under each car\r\nwith an air pipe _P_, leading to the engine. This is connected to _R_ by\r\nthe triple valve _V_. When the pressure in _P_ is reduced by the\r\nengineer or by accident, the triple valve operates so as to admit air\r\nfrom _R_ into the cylinder _C_ pushing the piston _H_ to the left. _H_\r\nis connected to the brakes by levers which press the brake shoes\r\nstrongly against the wheels. When the air pressure in _P_ is restored\r\nthe triple valve acts so as to permit the air in _C_ to escape while _R_\r\nis filled again from _P_. The hissing sound heard when a train stops is\r\ncaused by air escaping from cylinder _C_. The spring in _C_ keeps the\r\nbrakes from the wheels except when the \"air is on.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Cross-section of a gas meter showing its\r\nconstruction and action.]\r\n\r\n=69. The Gas Meter.=--The gas meter consists of a box divided into two\r\nparts by a vertical partition (Fig. 51). Two bellows are attached to\r\nthis partition, one on each side. The valves that regulate the flow of\r\ngas to and from the bellows and the chambers _A_ and _D_ are opened and\r\nclosed by levers connected with the bellows. These levers also operate\r\nthe hands upon the dials. When the inlet to the bellows _B_ is opened,\r\nthe outlet of _A_ is also opened. Gas entering _B_ opens the bellows and\r\nforces the gas in _A_ out into the house-pipe _E_. When _B_ is full its\r\ninlet valve closes and its outlet valve opens. The inlet of _A_ also\r\nopens and its outlet closes. Gas now flows into _A_, compressing the\r\nbellows and _B_, and forcing the gas from it into the house-pipe. At\r\neach filling of the bellows _B_ there will be displaced from _A_ and\r\nforced into the house-pipe as much gas as enters _B_. It is evident that\r\nat each emptying of _B_ an equal amount of gas enters _A_. Thus we have\r\n_A_ and _B_ alternately filling and emptying as long as the gas burner\r\nis open. To have a continuous flow of gas in the house-pipes two pipes\r\nand two chambers are necessary, one being filled while the other is\r\nbeing emptied.\r\n\r\nFig. 52 represents the dials upon a gas meter showing a reading of\r\n54,600 cu. ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Dials of a gas meter.]\r\n\r\n=70. Centrifugal Pumps.= Fluids, such as water and air, are often put in\r\nmotion by devices called _centrifugal pumps_ (see Art. 78). These pumps\r\ncontain a revolving part, like a wheel without a rim, whose spokes are\r\nreplaced by thin blades. This revolving part resembles the paddle wheel\r\nof some steam boats and is enclosed in a case or cover having one\r\nopening at the rim and another opening on one side about the axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--A vacuum sweeper. (_Courtesy of the Hoover\r\nSuction Sweeper Co._)]\r\n\r\nWhen the wheel is rapidly revolved, the fluid is driven out with\r\nconsiderable force through the opening at the rim, while a partial\r\nvacuum is produced at the axle causing a rapid flow into the device at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nThis is the principle of the action of the _vacuum cleaner_. Fig. 53 is\r\na section of a vacuum sweeper showing the revolving wheel and the\r\ncurrent of air passing into the wheel at the lower side and out of the\r\nrim of the case at the rear.\r\n\r\n_Centrifugal water pumps_ work on the same principle and furnish a\r\ncontinuous flow of water, often large in volume and at considerable\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Force.=--We have been studying various forces, such as air\r\npressure, pressure in liquids, and the force of elasticity in solids,\r\nand have considered them simply as pushes or pulls. A more formal study\r\nof forces in general and of devices for representing and measuring them\r\nwill be helpful at this point of the course.\r\n\r\n_A force is that which tends to cause a change in the size or shape of a\r\nbody or in its state of motion._ In other words a force is a push or a\r\npull. That is, force tends to produce distortion or change of motion in\r\na body. Force itself is invisible. We measure it by the effect it\r\nproduces. Forces are usually associated with the objects exerting them.\r\nThus we speak of _muscular force_, _air pressure_, _liquid pressure_,\r\nthe force of a spring, the force of the earth's attraction and so on.\r\n\r\nForces are classified in various ways.\r\n\r\nI. With respect to the _duration and steadiness_ of the force.\r\n\r\n(a) Constant, as the earth's attraction. (b) Impulsive, as the stroke of\r\na bat on a ball. (c) Variable, as the force of the wind.\r\n\r\nII. With respect to the _direction_ of the force.\r\n\r\n(a) Attractive, as the earth's attraction. (b) Repulsive, as air\r\npressure, liquid pressure, etc.\r\n\r\n=72. Methods of Measuring Force.=--Since forces are measured by their\r\neffects which are either distortion or change of motion, either of these\r\neffects may be used to measure them. For example, the force exerted by\r\na locomotive is sometimes computed by the _speed_ it can develop in a\r\ntrain of cars in a given time, or the force of the blow of a baseball\r\nbat is estimated by the _distance_ the ball goes before it strikes the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe more common method of measuring force, however, is by _distortion_,\r\nthat is, by measuring the change of shape of a body caused by the force.\r\nIn doing this, use is made of Hooke's Law (Art. 32), in which it is\r\nstated that \"within the limits of perfect elasticity,\" changes of size\r\nor shape are directly proportional to the forces employed. That is,\r\ntwice as great a force will produce twice as great a change of shape and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--A spring balance.]\r\n\r\nA common contrivance using this principle is the spring balance (Fig.\r\n55), with which all are familiar, as ice scales, meat scales, postal\r\nscales, etc. The object which changes shape in this device is a coiled\r\nspring contained in the case of the instrument. The balance is so\r\nconstructed that when the spring is pulled out as far as possible it has\r\nnot reached its limit of elasticity, since, if the spring were stretched\r\nso as to exceed its elastic limit, the index would not return to its\r\nfirst position on removing the load. (See Arts. 30-32.)\r\n\r\n=73. Graphic Representation of Forces.=--A force is said to have three\r\nelements. These are (a) _its point_ of _application_, (b) _its\r\ndirection_, and (c) _its magnitude_. For example, if there is hung upon\r\nthe hook of a spring balance a weight of 5 lbs., then we have: (a) its\r\npoint of application on the hook of the balance, (b) its downward\r\ndirection and (c) its magnitude, or 5 lbs. These three elements may be\r\nrepresented by a line. Thus in Fig. 56_a_, a line _AB_ is drawn as\r\nshown, five units long; _A_ represents the point of application; _B_,\r\nthe arrow head, shows the direction; and the length of the line (five\r\nunits) shows the magnitude of the force.\r\n\r\nThis is called a _graphic representation_ since it represents by a line\r\nthe quantity in question. If another weight of 5 lbs. were hung from the\r\nfirst one, the graphic representation of both forces would be as in Fig.\r\n56_b_. Here the first force is represented by _AB_ as before, _BC_\r\nrepresenting the second force applied. The whole line represents the\r\n_resultant_ of the two forces or the result of their combination. If the\r\ntwo weights were hung one at each end of a short stick _AC_ (Fig.\r\n56_c_), and the latter suspended at its center their combined weight or\r\n_resultant_ would of course be applied at the center. The direction\r\nwould be the same as that of the two weights. The resultant therefore is\r\nrepresented by _ON_. In order to exactly balance this resultant _ON_, a\r\nforce of equal magnitude but opposite in direction must be applied at\r\nthe point of application of _ON_, or _O_. _OM_ then represents a force\r\nthat will just balance or hold in equilibrium the resultant of the two\r\nforces _AB_ and _CD_. This line _OM_ therefore represents the\r\n_equilibrant_ of the weights _AB_ and _CD_. The resultant of two forces\r\nat an angle with each other is formed differently, as in Fig. 57 _a_.\r\nHere two forces _AB_ and _AC_ act at an angle with each other. Lay off\r\nat the designated angle the lines _AB_ and _AC_ of such length as will\r\naccurately represent the forces. Lay off _BD_ equal to _AC_ and _CD_\r\nequal to _AB_. The figure _ABCD_ is then a parallelogram. Its diagonal\r\n_AD_ represents the resultant of the forces _AB_ and _AC_ acting at the\r\nangle _BAC_. If _BAC_ equals 90 degrees or is a right angle, _AD_ may be\r\n_computed_ thus: _AB² + BD² = AD²_. Why?\r\n\r\n     and _AD_ = √_([line]AB² + [line]BD²)._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Graphic representation of forces acting along\r\nthe same or parallel lines.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Graphic representation of two forces acting\r\n(_a_) at a right angle, (_b_) at an acute angle.]\r\n\r\nThis method of determining the resultant by _computation_ may be used\r\nwhen the two forces are at right angles. (In any case, _AD may be\r\nmeasured_ using the same scale that is laid off upon _AB_ and _AC_, as\r\nshown in Fig. 57 _b_.) The three cases of combining forces just given\r\nmay be classified as follows: The _first_ is that of _two forces acting\r\nalong the same line_ in the same or opposite direction, as when two\r\nhorses are hitched tandem, or in a tug of war. The _second_ is that of\r\n_two forces acting along parallel lines_, in the same direction, as when\r\ntwo horses are hitched side by side or abreast. The _third_ is that of\r\n_two forces acting at the same point at an angle_. It may be represented\r\nby the device shown in Fig. 58, consisting of two spring balances\r\nsuspended from nails at the top of the blackboard at _A_ and _B_. A cord\r\nis attached to both hooks and is passed through a small ring at _O_ from\r\nwhich is suspended a known weight, _W_. Lines are drawn on the\r\nblackboard under the stretched cords, from _O_ toward _OA_, _OB_, and\r\n_OW_ and distances measured on each from _O_ to correspond to the three\r\nforces as read on balance _A_ and _B_ and the weight _W_. Let a\r\nparallelogram be constructed on the lines measured off on _OA_ and _OB_.\r\nIts diagonal drawn from _O_ will be found to be vertical and of the same\r\nlength as the line measured on _OW_. The diagonal is the _resultant_ of\r\nthe two forces and _OW_ is the equilibrant which is equal and opposite\r\nto the resultant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Experimental proof of parallelogram of forces.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the _first_ case may be represented by a boat moving up or down a\r\nstream; the resultant motion being the combined effect of the boat's\r\nmotion and that of the stream. The _second_, may be represented by two\r\nhorses attached side by side to the same evener. The resultant force\r\nequals the sum of the two component forces. The _third_, may be\r\nrepresented by a boat going across a stream, the resultant motion being\r\nrepresented by the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by using the\r\nlines that represent the motion of the stream and of the boat.\r\n\r\n=74. Units for Measuring Force.=--Force is commonly measured in units of\r\nweight: in pounds, kilograms, and grams. For example, we speak of 15\r\nlbs. pressure per square inch and 1033.6 g. pressure per square\r\ncentimeter as representing the air pressure. It should be noted here\r\nthat the words pound, kilogram, and gram are used not only to represent\r\n_weight_ or _force_ but also the masses of the objects considered. Thus,\r\none may speak of a pound-mass meaning the amount of material in the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nIt will help to avoid confusion if we reserve the simple terms \"gram\"\r\nand \"pound\" to denote exclusively an amount of matter, that is, a mass,\r\nand to use the full expression \"gram of force\" or \"pound of force\"\r\nwhenever we have in mind the pull of the earth upon these masses. Or,\r\none may speak of a _pound-weight_ meaning the amount of attraction\r\nexerted by the earth upon the object. The same is true of _gram-mass_\r\nand _gram-weight_. The mass of a body does not change when the body is\r\ntransferred to another place. The weight, however, may vary, for on\r\nmoving a body from the equator toward the poles of the earth the weight\r\nis known to increase.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Definition of force.\r\n\r\n2. Classification of forces. (a) Duration: constant, impulsive,\r\nvariable. (b) Direction: attractive, repulsive.\r\n\r\n3. Methods of measuring force. (a) By distortion.

Show graphically the resultant of two forces at right angles, one of\r\n12 lbs., the other of 16 lbs. What is the magnitude of this resultant?\r\nThen determine the answer, first by measurement and then by computation.\r\nWhich answer is more accurate? Why?\r\n\r\n4. Represent by a parallelogram the two forces that support a person\r\nsitting in a hammock and draw the line representing the resultant.\r\n\r\n5. Find graphically the resultant of the pull of two forces, one of 500\r\nlbs. east and one of 600 lbs. northwest.\r\n\r\n6. Determine the equilibrant of two forces, one of 800 lbs. south and\r\none of 600 lbs. west.\r\n\r\n7. Would the fact that weight varies on going from the equator to either\r\npole be shown by a spring balance or a beam balance? Explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) MOTION. NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION\r\n\r\n=75. Motion a Change of Position.=--Motion is defined as a continuous\r\n_change in the position_ of a body. The _position_ of a body is usually\r\ndescribed as its _distance_ and _direction_ from some fixed point. Thus\r\na man on a boat may be at rest with respect to the boat and moving with\r\nrespect to the earth. Or, if he walks toward the stern as fast as the\r\nboat moves forward, he may keep directly over a rock on the bottom of\r\nthe lake and hence not be moving with reference to the rock and yet be\r\nin motion with respect to the boat. Motion and rest, therefore, are\r\n_relative_ terms. The earth itself is in motion in turning on its axis,\r\nin moving along its orbit, and in following the sun in its motion\r\nthrough space. Motions are classified in several ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) MODES OF MOTION\r\n\r\n1. _Translation._--A body is said to have motion of _translation_ when\r\nevery line in it keeps the same direction.\r\n\r\n2. _Rotation._--A body has motion of _rotation_ when it turns upon a\r\nfixed axis within the body, as a wheel upon its axle or the earth upon\r\nits axis.\r\n\r\n3. _Vibration_ or _Oscillation_.--A body is said to have _vibratory_ or\r\n_oscillatory_ motion when it returns to the same point at regular\r\nintervals by reversals of motion along a given path, _e.g._, a pendulum.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) DIRECTION OF MOTION\r\n\r\n1. _Rectilinear._--A body has rectilinear motion when its path is a\r\nstraight line. Absolute rectilinear motion does not exist, although the\r\nmotion of a train on a straight stretch of track is nearly rectilinear.\r\n\r\n2. _Curvilinear._--A body has _curvilinear_ motion when its path is a\r\ncurved line, _e.g._, the path of a thrown ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n(C) UNIFORMITY OF MOTION\r\n\r\n1. _Uniform._--A body has uniform motion when its speed and direction of\r\nmotion do not change. Uniform motion for extended periods is rarely\r\nobserved. A train may cover, on an average, 40 miles per hour but during\r\neach hour its speed may rise and fall.\r\n\r\n2. _Variable._--A body has variable motion when its speed or direction\r\nof motion is continually changing. Most bodies have variable motion.\r\n\r\n3. _Accelerated._--A body has accelerated motion when its speed or\r\ndirection of motion continually changes. If the speed changes by the\r\nsame amount each second, _and the direction of motion does not change_\r\nthe motion is said to be _uniformly_ accelerated, _e.g._, a falling\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nUniformly accelerated motion will be studied further under the topic of\r\nfalling bodies.\r\n\r\n_Velocity_ is _the rate of motion_ of a body in a given direction. For\r\nexample, a bullet may have a velocity of 1300 ft. a second upwards.\r\n_Acceleration_ is _the rate of change of velocity_ in a given direction,\r\nor the change of velocity in a unit of time. A train starting from a\r\nstation gradually increases its speed. The gain in velocity during one\r\nsecond is its acceleration. When the velocity is decreasing, as when a\r\ntrain is slowing down, the acceleration is opposite in direction to the\r\nvelocity. A falling body falls faster and faster. It has _downward\r\nacceleration_. A ball thrown upward goes more and more slowly. It also\r\nhas _downward acceleration_.\r\n\r\n=76. Momentum.=--It is a matter of common observation that a heavy body\r\nis set in motion with more difficulty than a light one, or if the same\r\nforce is used for the same length of time upon a light and a heavy\r\nbody,[E] the light body will be given a greater velocity. This\r\nobservation has led to the _calculation_ of what is called the \"quantity\r\nof motion\" of a body, or its _momentum_. It is computed by multiplying\r\nthe mass by the velocity. If the C.G.S. system is used we shall have as\r\nthe momentum of a 12 g. body moving 25 cm. a second a momentum of 12 ×\r\n25 or 300 C.G.S. units of momentum. This unit has no name and is\r\ntherefore expressed as indicated above. The formula for computing\r\nmomentum is: _M = mv_.\r\n\r\n  [E] By a light body is meant one of small mass, a heavy body\r\n  possessing much greater mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nNewton's Laws of Motion\r\n\r\n=77. Inertia, First Law of Motion.=--One often observes when riding in a\r\ntrain that if the train moves forward suddenly the passengers do not get\r\ninto motion as soon as the train, and apparently are jerked backward.\r\nWhile if the train is stopped suddenly, the passengers tend to keep in\r\nmotion. This tendency of matter to keep moving when in motion and to\r\nremain at rest when at rest is often referred to as the property of\r\n_inertia_. _Newton's first law of motion_, often called the _law of\r\ninertia_, describes this property of matter as follows:\r\n\r\n_Every body continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a\r\nstraight line unless it is compelled to change that state by some\r\nexternal force._ This means that if an object like a book is lying on a\r\ntable it will remain there until removed by some outside force. No\r\ninanimate object can move itself or stop itself. If a ball is thrown\r\ninto the air it would move on forever if it were not for the _force_ of\r\nattraction of the earth and the resistance of the air.\r\n\r\nIt takes time to put a mass into motion, a heavy object requiring more\r\ntime for a change than a light object. As an example of this, note the\r\nmovements of passengers in a street car when it starts or stops\r\nsuddenly. Another illustration of the law of inertia is the so-called\r\n\"penny and card\" experiment. Balance a card on the end of a finger.\r\nPlace on it a coin directly over the finger, snap the card quickly so as\r\nto drive the card from beneath the coin. The coin will remain on the\r\nfinger. (See Fig. 59.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--The ball remains when the card is driven away.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Newton's first law of motion a moving body which could be\r\nentirely freed from the action of all external forces would have uniform\r\nmotion, and would describe a perfectly straight course. The curved path\r\ntaken by a baseball when thrown shows that it is acted upon by an\r\noutside force. This force, the attraction of the earth, is called\r\n_gravity_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ISAAC NEWTON \"By Permission of the Berlin\r\nPhotographic Co., New York.\"\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) Professor of mathematics at Cambridge\r\nuniversity; discovered gravitation; invented calculus; announced the\r\nlaws of motion; wrote the Principia; made many discoveries in light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALILEO GALILEI \"By Permission of the Berlin Photographic\r\nCo., New York.\"\r\n\r\nGalileo Galilei (1564-1642). Italian. \"Founder of experimental science\";\r\n\"Originator of modern physics\"; made the first thermometer; discovered\r\nthe laws of falling bodies and the laws of the pendulum; invented\r\nGalilean telescope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Cross-section of the DeLaval cream separator.]\r\n\r\n=78. Curvilinear Motion.=--Curvilinear motion occurs when a moving body\r\nis pulled or pushed away from a straight path. The pull or push is\r\ncalled _centripetal_ (center-seeking) force. A moving stone on the end\r\nof a string when pulled toward the hand moves in a curve. If the string\r\nis released the stone moves in a tangent to the curve. The string pulls\r\nthe hand. This phase of the pull is called _centrifugal_ force. The\r\n_centripetal_ force is the pull on the stone. Centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal force together cause a tension in the string. Examples of\r\ncurvilinear motion are very common. The rider and horse in a circus ring\r\nlean inward in order to move in a curve. The curve on a running track in\r\na gymnasium is \"banked\" for the same reason. Mud flying from the wheel\r\nof a carriage, the skidding of an automobile when passing rapidly around\r\na corner, and sparks flying from an emery wheel, are illustrations of\r\nthe First Law of Motion.\r\n\r\nCream is separated from milk by placing the whole milk in a rapidly\r\nrevolving bowl, the cream being lighter collects in the center and is\r\nthrown off at the top. (See Fig. 60.) Clothes in steam laundries are\r\ndried by a centrifugal drier. In amusement parks many devices use this\r\nprinciple. (See centrifugal pumps, Art. 70.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--The two balls reach the floor at the same\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\n=79. The Second Law of Motion,= sometimes called the _law of momentum_,\r\nleads to the _measurement of force_, by the momentum or the quantity of\r\nmotion, produced by it. The law is stated as follows:\r\n\r\n_Change of motion, or momentum, is proportional to the acting force and\r\ntakes place in the direction in which the force acts._ In other words,\r\nif two or more forces act at the same instant upon a body each produces\r\nthe same effect that it would if acting alone. If a card be supported on\r\ntwo nails driven horizontally close together into an upright board (see\r\nFig. 61), and two marbles be so placed on the ends as to balance each\r\nother, when one marble is snapped horizontally by a blow, the other will\r\nfall. Both reach the floor at the same time. The two balls are equally\r\npulled down by the earth's attraction and strike the ground at the same\r\ntime, though one is shot sidewise, and the other is dropped vertically.\r\n\r\nAs gravity is a constant force, while the blow was only a momentary\r\nforce, the actual path or resultant motion will be a curved line.\r\n\r\nThe constant relation, between the acting force and the change of\r\nmomentum it produces in a body, has led to the adoption of a convenient\r\nC.G.S. unit of force called the _dyne_. _The dyne is that force which\r\ncan impart to a mass of one gram a change of velocity at the rate of one\r\ncentimeter per second every second._ This definition assumes that the\r\nbody acted upon is free to move without hindrance of any kind, so that\r\nthe acting force has to overcome only the _inertia_ of the body.\r\n_However_, the _law_ applies in every case of application of force, so\r\nthat each force produces its full effect independently of other forces\r\nthat may be acting at the same time upon the body.\r\n\r\n=80. Newton's Third Law.=--This law has been experienced by everyone who\r\nhas jumped from a rowboat near the shore. The muscular action that\r\npushes the body forward from the boat also pushes the boat backward,\r\noften with awkward results. The law is stated: _To every action, there\r\nis always an opposite and equal reaction, or the mutual actions of any\r\ntwo bodies are always equal and opposite in direction_. Many\r\nillustrations of this law are in every one's mind: a stretched rope\r\npulls with the same force in one direction as it does in the opposite\r\ndirection. If a bat hits a ball, the ball hits the bat with an equal and\r\nopposite force. The third law is therefore sometimes called the law of\r\n_reaction_. When a weight is hung upon a spring balance the action of\r\nthe weight pulls down the spring until it has stretched sufficiently\r\n(Hooke's Law) to produce an elastic _reaction_ that equals and hence\r\nsupports the weight. When a man stands at the center of a plank\r\nsupported at its ends, the action of the man's weight bends the plank\r\nuntil the elastic force developed in the plank equals the weight\r\napplied. Further, when a train or a wagon is on a bridge the bridge\r\nyields until it has developed an elastic reaction equal to the weight\r\napplied. If a person stands in the center of a room, the floor beams\r\nyield until the third law is satisfied. In fact, whenever a force acts,\r\na contrary equal force always acts.\r\n\r\n=81. Stress and Strain.=--A pair of forces that constitute an action and\r\na reaction is called a _stress_. The two forces are two parts of one\r\n_stress_. If the two forces act away from each other, as in the breaking\r\nof a string, the stress is called a _tension_, but if they act toward\r\neach other as in crushing anything, the stress is called a _pressure_.\r\nIn order for a body to exert force it must meet with resistance. The\r\nforce exerted is never greater than the resistance encountered. Thus one\r\ncan exert but little force upon a feather floating in the air or upon\r\nother light objects. A fast moving shot exerts no force unless it\r\nencounters some resistance.\r\n\r\nForces, then, are always found in pairs. Thus to break a string, to\r\nstretch an elastic band, to squeeze a lemon, one must exert two equal\r\nand opposite forces. Such a thing as a single force acting alone is\r\nunknown. Usually, however, we give our attention mainly to one of the\r\nforces and ignore the other. When a force acts upon a body the change of\r\nshape or size resulting is called a _strain_. Hooke's law (Art. 32) is\r\noften expressed as follows: \"The strain is proportional to the stress,\"\r\n_e.g._, the stretch of the spring of a spring balance is proportional to\r\nthe load placed upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Why does the catcher on a baseball team wear a padded glove?\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) RESOLUTION OF FORCES\r\n\r\n=82. Resolution of Forces.=--We have been studying the effect of forces\r\nin producing motion and the results of combining forces in _many_ ways;\r\nin the _same line_, in _parallel lines_, and in _diverging lines_.\r\nAnother case of much interest and importance is _the determination of\r\nthe effectiveness of a force in a direction different from the one in\r\nwhich it acts_. This case which is called _resolution of forces_ is\r\nfrequently used. To illustrate: one needs but to recall that a sailor\r\nuses this principle in a practical way whenever he sails his boat in any\r\nother direction than the one in which the wind is blowing, _e.g._, when\r\nthe wind is blowing, say from the north, the boat may be driven east,\r\nwest, or to any point south between the east and west and it is even\r\npossible to beat back against the wind toward the northeast or\r\nnorthwest. Take a sled drawn by a short rope with the force applied\r\nalong the line _AB_ (see Fig. 62); part of this force tends to lift the\r\nfront of the sled as _AC_ and a part to draw it forward as _AD_. Hence\r\nnot all of the force applied along _AB_ is used in drawing the sled\r\nforward. Its effectiveness is indicated by the relative size of the\r\ncomponent _AD_ compared to _AB_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--_AD_ is the effective component.]\r\n\r\nThe force of gravity acting upon a sphere that is resting on an\r\n_inclined plane_ may be readily resolved into two components, one, the\r\n_effective_ component, as _OR_, and the other, the _non-effective_ as\r\n_OS_. (See Fig. 63.) If the angle _ACB_ is 30 degrees, _AB_ equals 1/2\r\nof _AC_ and _OR_ equals 1/2 of _OG_, so that the speed of the sphere\r\ndown the plane developed in 1 second is less than (about one-half of)\r\nthe speed of a freely falling body developed in the same time. Why is\r\n_OS_ non-effective?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--The effective component is _OR_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Resolution of the forces acting on an\r\naeroplane.]\r\n\r\n=83. The Aeroplane.=--The aeroplane consists of one or two frames _ABCD_\r\n(see Fig. 64), over which is stretched cloth or thin sheet metal. It is\r\ndriven through the air by a propeller turned by a powerful gasoline\r\nmotor. This has the effect of creating a strong breeze coming toward the\r\nfront of the aeroplane. As in the case of the sailboat a pressure is\r\ncreated at right angles to the plane along _GF_ and this may be resolved\r\ninto two components as _GC_ and _GE_, _GC_ acting to lift the aeroplane\r\nvertically and _GE_ opposing the action of the propeller. Fig. 65\r\nrepresents the Curtis Flying Boat passing over the Detroit river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--The Curtis hydroplane.]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises.\r\n\r\n1.

Explain by use of a diagram.\r\n\r\n8. A wind strikes the sail of a boat at an angle of 60 degrees to the\r\nperpendicular with a pressure of 3 lbs. per square foot.

How is the vertical component of the force acting on an aeroplane\r\naffected when the front edge of the plane is elevated? Show by diagram.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) MOMENT OF FORCE AND PARALLEL FORCES\r\n\r\n=84. Moment of Force.=--In the study of motion we found that the\r\nquantity of motion is called _momentum_ and is measured by the product\r\nof the _mass times the velocity_. In the study of _parallel forces_,\r\nespecially such as tend to produce _rotation_, we consider a similar\r\nquantity. It is called a _moment of force_, which is the term applied to\r\nthe _effectiveness_ of a force in producing change of rotation. It also\r\nmeasured by the product of two quantities; _One, the magnitude of the\r\nforce itself_, and the other, _the perpendicular distance from the axis\r\nabout which the rotation takes place to the line representing the\r\ndirection of the force_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--The moments about _S_ are equal.]\r\n\r\n_To illustrate:_ Take a rod, as a meter stick, drill a hole at _S_ and\r\nplace through it a screw fastened at the top of the blackboard. Attach\r\nby cords two spring balances and draw to the right and left, _A_ and _B_\r\nas in Fig. 66. Draw out the balance _B_ about half way, hold it\r\nsteadily, or fasten the cord at the side of the blackboard, and read\r\nboth balances. Note also the distance _AS_ and _BS_. Since the rod is at\r\nrest, the tendency to rotate to the right and left must be equal. That\r\nis, the moments of the forces at _A_ and _B_ about _S_ are equal. Since\r\nthese are computed by the product of the _force times the force_ arm,\r\nmultiply _B_ by _BS_ and _A_ by _AS_ and see if the computed moments are\r\nequal. _Hence a force that tends to turn or rotate a body to the right\r\ncan be balanced by another of equal moment that acts toward the left._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Law of parallel forces illustrated.]\r\n\r\n=85. Parallel Forces.=--Objects are frequently supported by two or more\r\nupward forces acting at different points and forming in this way a\r\nsystem of parallel forces; as when two boys carry a string of fish on a\r\nrod between them or when a bridge is supported at its ends. The\r\nprinciple of moments just described aids in determining the magnitude of\r\nsuch forces and of their resultant. To illustrate this take a wooden\r\nboard 4 in. wide and 4 ft. long of uniform dimensions. (See Fig. 67.)\r\nPlace several screw hooks on one edge with one set at _O_ where the\r\nboard will hang horizontally when the board is suspended there. Weigh\r\nthe board by a spring balance hung at _O_. This will be the resultant in\r\nthe following tests. Now hang the board from two spring balances at _M_\r\nand _N_ and read both _balances_. Call readings _f_ and _f´_. To test\r\nthe forces consider _M_ as a fixed point (see Fig. 67) and the weight of\r\nthe board to act at _O_. Then the moment of the weight of the board\r\nshould be equal the moment of the force at _N_ since the board does not\r\nmove, or _w_ times _OM_ equals _f´_ times _NM_. If _N_ is considered the\r\nfixed point then the moment of the weight of the board and of _f with\r\nreference to the point N_ should be equal, or _w_ times _ON_ = _f_ times\r\n_NM_. Keeping this illustration in mind, the law of parallel forces may\r\nbe stated at follows: 1. _The resultant of two parallel forces acting in\r\nthe same direction at different points in a body is equal to their sum\r\nand has the same direction as the components._\r\n\r\n_The moment of one of the components about the point of application of\r\nthe other is equal and opposite to the moment of the supported weight\r\nabout the other._\r\n\r\n     =Problem.=--If two boys carry a string of fish weighing 40 lbs. on\r\n     a rod 8 ft. long between them, what force must each boy exert if\r\n     the string is 5 ft. from the rear boy?\r\n\r\n     =Solution.=--The moment of the force _F_ exerted about the opposite\r\n     end by the rear boy is _F_ × 8. The moment of the weight about the\r\n     same point is 40 × (8 - 5) = 120. Therefore _F_ × 8 = 120, or _F_ =\r\n     15, the force exerted by the rear boy. The front boy exerts a force\r\n     of _F_ whose moment about the other end of the rod is _F_ × 8. The\r\n     moment of the weight about the same point is 40 × 5 = 200. Since\r\n     the moment of _F_ equals this, 200 = _F_ × 8, or _F_ = 25. Hence\r\n     the front boy exerts 25 lbs. and the rear boy 15 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--A couple.]\r\n\r\n=86. The Couple.=--If two equal parallel forces act upon a body along\r\ndifferent lines in opposite directions, as in Fig. 68, they have no\r\nsingle resultant or there is no one force that will have the same effect\r\nas the two components acting together. A combination of forces of this\r\nkind is called a _couple_. Its tendency is to produce change of rotation\r\nin a body. An example is the action upon a compass needle which is\r\nrotated by a force which urges one end toward the north and by an equal\r\nforce which urges the other end toward the south.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Show by diagram how to arrange a three-horse evener so that each\r\nhorse must take one-third of the load.\r\n\r\n2.

If two horses draw a load exerting a combined pull of 300 lbs., what\r\nforce must each exert if one is 28 in. and the other is 32 in. from the\r\npoint of attachment of the evener to the load?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Forces acting upon a stretched rope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--A crane with horizontal tie.]\r\n\r\n4. A weight of 100 lbs. is suspended at the middle of a rope _ACB_ 20\r\nft. long. (See Fig. 69.) The ends of the rope are fastened at points _A_\r\nand _B_ at the same height. Consider _D_ as the center of the line _AB_.\r\nWhat is the tension of the rope when _CD_ is 3 ft.? When _CD_ is 1 ft.?\r\nWhen _CD_ is 1 in.?\r\n\r\n5. A crane is set up with the tie horizontal.

Resolve a force of 500 lbs. into two components at right angles to\r\neach other, one of which shall be four times the other.\r\n\r\n11. A truss (see Fig. 71), carries a load of 1000 lbs. at _C_. Find the\r\nforces acting along _AC_, _BC_, and _AB_.

Gravitation.=--Gravitation is the force of attraction that exists\r\nbetween all bodies of matter at all distances. This attraction exists\r\nnot only between the heavenly bodies, the stars and planets, etc., but\r\nis also found between bodies on the earth. A book attracts all objects\r\nin a room and outside of a room as well, since its weight shows that it\r\nis attracted by the earth itself. The gravitational attraction between\r\nordinary bodies is so slight that it requires careful experiments to\r\ndetect it. In fact, it is only when one of the attracting bodies is\r\nlarge, as for example the earth, that the force becomes considerable.\r\nCareful studies of the motions of the heavenly bodies, especially of\r\nthat of the moon in its orbit about the earth, led Sir Isaac Newton to\r\nthe statement of the _law of gravitation_ which is well expressed in the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n=88. Law of Gravitation.=--_Every particle of matter in the universe\r\nattracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional\r\nto the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square\r\nof the distance between them._\r\n\r\nThe law may be separated into two parts, one referring to the masses of\r\nthe bodies concerned, the other to the effect of the distance between\r\nthem. The first part is easily understood since we all know that two\r\nquarts of milk will weigh just twice as much as one quart. To illustrate\r\nthe second part of the law, suppose that the moon were removed to\r\n_twice_ its present distance from the earth, then the attraction between\r\nthe earth and the moon would be _one-fourth_ its present attraction. If\r\nremoved to _three_ times its present distance, the attraction would be\r\n_one-ninth_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of the earth for other bodies on or near it is called\r\n_gravity_. The _weight_ of a body is the measure of the earth's\r\nattraction for it; or it is the force of gravity acting upon it.\r\nNewton's third law of motion states that every action is accompanied by\r\nan equal and opposite reaction (Art. 80). Hence, the attraction of the\r\nearth for a book or any other object is accompanied by an equal\r\nattraction of the book for the earth.\r\n\r\n=89. Weight.=--In advanced physics it is proved that a sphere attracts\r\nas if it were concentrated at its center. Thus if the earth's radius be\r\nconsidered as 4000 miles, then a body 4000 miles above the earth's\r\nsurface would be 8000 miles above the earth's center, or twice as far\r\nfrom the center of the earth as is a body upon the earth's surface. A\r\nbody then 4000 miles above the earth's surface will weigh then but\r\none-fourth as much as it will at the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nSince the earth is flattened at the poles, the surface at the equator\r\nis farther from the center of the earth than at points north or south.\r\nThus a body weighing 1 lb. at the equator weighs 1.002 lb. at Chicago,\r\nor about 1/500 more. The rotation of the earth also affects the weight\r\nof a body upon it so that at the equator the weight of a body is 1/289\r\nless than at the pole. Both effects, that of flattening and of rotation,\r\ntend to diminish the weight of bodies at the equator, so that a body at\r\nthe latter place weighs about 1/192 less than at the poles.\r\n\r\n     In studying the effect of the earth's gravity, the following\r\n     illustration will be helpful: Imagine an open shaft a mile square\r\n     extending through the earth. What would happen to a stone thrown\r\n     into the shaft? At first it would have the attraction of the whole\r\n     earth drawing it and continually increasing its speed downward. As\r\n     it descends from the surface, the pull toward the center grows less\r\n     and less. Halfway to the center the body has lost half its weight.\r\n     When the stone reaches the center, the pull in all directions is\r\n     the same, or in other words, _it has no weight_. It would, however,\r\n     continue moving rapidly on account of its inertia, and as it\r\n     continues on from the center, the greater part of the earth being\r\n     left behind, the attraction pulling toward the center will\r\n     gradually stop it. It will then fall again toward the center and be\r\n     stopped again after passing it, and after repeatedly moving up and\r\n     down will finally come to rest at the center of the earth. At this\r\n     point it will be found to be a body without weight since it is\r\n     pulled equally in all directions by the material of the earth. What\r\n     force brings the body to rest?\r\n\r\n=90. Center of Gravity.=--A body is composed of a great many particles\r\neach of which is pulled toward the center of the earth by the force of\r\ngravity. A single force that would exactly equal the combined effect of\r\nthe pull of the earth for all the particles of a body would be their\r\nresultant. The _magnitude_ of this resultant is the weight of the body.\r\nThe _direction_ of this resultant is in a line passing toward the\r\nearth's center, while the _point of application_ of this resultant is\r\ncalled the _center of gravity_ of the body. The center of gravity of a\r\nbody may also be briefly defined as _the point about which it may be\r\nbalanced_. As the location of this point depends upon the distribution\r\nof matter in the body, the center of gravity is also sometimes called\r\nthe _center of mass_ of the body.\r\n\r\nThe earth's attraction for a body is considered for the sake of\r\nsimplicity, not as a multitude of little forces, but as a single force\r\napplied at its center of gravity. To find the center of gravity of a\r\nbody find two intersecting lines along which it balances, see Fig. 72,\r\nand the center of gravity will be at the intersection. A vertical line\r\nthrough this point is sometimes called the _line of direction of the\r\nweight_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--The center of gravity is at the intersection of\r\nthe lines of direction.]\r\n\r\n=91. Equilibrium of Bodies.=--Equilibrium means equally balanced. A body\r\nat rest or in uniform motion is then in equilibrium. An object is in\r\nequilibrium under gravity when a vertical line through its center of\r\ngravity passes through the point of support. A trunk is an example of a\r\nbody in equilibrium since a vertical line from its center of gravity\r\nfalls within the base formed by the area upon which it rests. Work will\r\nbe necessary to tip the trunk from its position. The amount of work\r\nrequired will depend upon the weight of the body and the location of the\r\ncenter of gravity.\r\n\r\n=92. Kinds of Equilibrium.--(a) Stable.=--A body is in stable\r\nequilibrium under gravity if its center of gravity is raised whenever\r\nthe body is displaced. It will return to its first position if allowed\r\nto fall after being slightly displaced. In Fig. 73, _a_ and _b_ if\r\nslightly tipped will return to their first position. They are in stable\r\nequilibrium. Other examples are a rocking chair, and the combination\r\nshown in Fig. 74.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Stable equilibrium.]\r\n\r\n=(b) Unstable.=--A body is in unstable equilibrium under gravity if its\r\ncenter of gravity is lowered whenever the body is slightly displaced. It\r\nwill fall farther from its first position. A pencil balanced on its\r\npoint or a broom balanced on the end of the handle are in unstable\r\nequilibrium. The slightest disturbance will make the line of direction\r\nof the weight fall outside of (away from) the point of support (Fig. 75\r\n_a_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74--An example of stable equilibrium. Why?]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Unstable equilibrium _a_, neutral equilibrium\r\n_b_.]\r\n\r\n=(c) Neutral.=--A body is in neutral equilibrium if its center of\r\ngravity is neither raised nor lowered whenever the body is moved.\r\nFamiliar examples are a ball lying on a table (Fig. 75 _b_) and a wagon\r\nmoving on a level street (referring to its forward motion).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--_B_ is more stable than _A_.]\r\n\r\n=93. Stability.=--When a body is in stable equilibrium, effort must be\r\nexerted to overturn it, and the degree of stability is measured by the\r\neffort required to overturn it. To overturn a body, it must be moved so\r\nthat the vertical line through its center of gravity will pass outside\r\nof its supporting base. This movement in stable bodies necessitates a\r\nraising of the center of gravity. The higher this center of gravity must\r\nbe raised in overturning the body, the more stable it is, _e.g._, see\r\nFig. 76. Thus a wagon on a hillside will not overturn until its weight\r\nfalls outside of its base, as in Fig. 77 _B_. The stability of a body\r\ndepends upon the position of its center of gravity and the area of its\r\nbase. _The lower the center of gravity and the larger the base_, the\r\nmore stable the body. What means are employed to give stability to\r\nbodies, in every-day use (such as clocks, ink-stands, pitchers, vases,\r\nchairs, lamps, etc.)?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--_B_ will overturn; _A_ will not.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Explain why the use of a cane by old people makes it easier for them\r\nto walk?\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) FALLING BODIES\r\n\r\n=94. Falling Bodies.=--One of the earliest physical facts learned by a\r\nchild is that a body unsupported falls toward the earth. When a child\r\nlets go of a toy, he soon learns to look for it on the floor. It is also\r\nof common observation that light objects, as feathers and paper, fall\r\nmuch slower than a stone. The information, therefore, that all bodies\r\nactually fall at the same rate in a vacuum or when removed from the\r\nretarding influence of the air is received with surprise.\r\n\r\nThis fact may be shown by using what is called a coin and feather tube.\r\nOn exhausting the air from this tube, the feather and coin within are\r\nseen to fall at the same rate. (See Fig. 78.) when air is again\r\nadmitted, the feather flutters along behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Bodies fall alike in a vacuum.]\r\n\r\n=95. Galileo's Experiment.=--The fact that bodies of different weight\r\ntend to fall at the same rate was first experimentally shown by Galileo\r\nby dropping a 1-lb. and a 100-lb. ball from the top of the leaning tower\r\nof Pisa in Italy (represented in Fig. 79). Both starting at the same\r\ntime struck the ground together. Galileo inferred from this that\r\nfeathers and other light objects would fall at the same rate as iron or\r\nlead were it not for the resistance of the air. After the invention of\r\nthe air pump this supposition was verified as just explained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Leaning tower of Pisa.]\r\n\r\n=96. Acceleration Due to Gravity.=--If a body falls freely, that is\r\nwithout meeting a resistance or a retarding influence, its motion will\r\ncontinually increase. The _increase_ in motion is found to be constant\r\nor uniform during each second. This uniform increase in motion or in\r\nvelocity of a falling body gives one of the best illustrations that we\r\nhave of uniformly accelerated motion. (Art. 75.) On the other hand, a\r\nbody thrown upward has uniformly retarded motion, that is, its\r\nacceleration is downward. The velocity acquired by a falling body in\r\nunit time is called its _acceleration_, or the _acceleration due to\r\ngravity_, and is equal to 32.16 ft. (980 cm.) per second, downward, each\r\nsecond of time. In one second, therefore, a falling body gains a\r\nvelocity of 32.16 ft. (980 cm.) per second, downward. In two seconds it\r\ngains twice this, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn formulas, the acceleration of gravity is represented by \"_g_\" and the\r\nnumber of seconds by _t_, therefore the formula for finding the\r\nvelocity, _V_,[F] of a falling body starting from rest is _V_ = _gt_. In\r\nstudying gravity (Art. 89) we learned that its force varies as one moves\r\ntoward or away from the equator. (How?) In latitude 38° the acceleration\r\nof gravity is 980 cm. per second each second of time.\r\n\r\n  [F] _V_ represents the velocity of a falling body at the end of _t_\r\n  seconds.\r\n\r\n=97. Experimental Study of Falling Bodies.=--To study falling bodies\r\nexperimentally by observing the fall of unobstructed bodies is a\r\ndifficult matter. Many devices have been used to reduce the motion so\r\nthat the action of a falling body may be observed within the limits of a\r\nlaboratory or lecture room. The simplest of these, and in some respects\r\nthe most satisfactory, was used by Galileo. It consists of an inclined\r\nplane which reduces the effective component of the force of gravity so\r\nthat the motion of a body rolling down the plane may be observed for\r\nseveral seconds. For illustrating this principle a steel piano wire has\r\nbeen selected as being the simplest and the most easily understood. This\r\nwire is stretched taut across a room by a turn-buckle so that its slope\r\nis about one in sixteen. (See Fig. 80.) Down this wire a weighted pulley\r\nis allowed to run and the distance it travels in 1, 2, 3, and 4 seconds\r\nis observed. From these observations we can compute the distance covered\r\neach second and the velocity at the end of each second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Apparatus to illustrate uniformly accelerated\r\nmotion.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 63, if _OG_ represents the weight of the body or the pull of\r\ngravity, then the line _OR_ will represent the effective component along\r\nthe wire, and _OS_ the non-effective component against the wire. Since\r\nthe ratio of the height of the plane to its length is as one to sixteen,\r\nthen the motion along the wire in Fig. 80 will be one-sixteenth that of\r\na falling body.\r\n\r\n=98. Summary of Results.=--The following table gives the results that\r\nhave been obtained with an apparatus arranged as shown above.\r\n\r\nIn this table, column 2 is the one which contains the results directly\r\nobserved by the use of the apparatus. Columns, 3, 4, and 5 are computed\r\nfrom preceding columns.\r\n\r\n     (1)     (2)         (3)            (4)            (5)\r\n   No. of    Total     Distance     Velocity at     Acceleration\r\n  seconds  distance  each second   end of second    each second\r\n             moved\r\n\r\n                                    Per second      Per second\r\n     1      30 cm.       30 cm.         60 cm.          60 cm.\r\n     2     120 cm.       90 cm.        120 cm.          60 cm.\r\n     3     270 cm.       150 cm.       180 cm.          60 cm.\r\n     4     480 cm.       210 cm.       240 cm.          60 cm.\r\n\r\nColumn 5 shows that the acceleration is uniform, or the same each\r\nsecond. Column 4 shows that the velocity increases with the number of\r\nseconds or that _V_ = _at_. Column 3 shows that the increase in motion\r\nfrom 1 second to the next is just equal to the acceleration or 60 cm.\r\nThis is represented by the following formula: _s_ = 1/2 _a_(2_t_ - 1).\r\n\r\nThe results of the second column, it may be seen, increase as 1:4:9:16,\r\nwhile the number of seconds vary as 1:2:3:4. That is, _the total\r\ndistance covered is proportional to the square of the number of\r\nseconds_.\r\n\r\nThis fact expressed as a formula gives: _S_ = 1/2_at_².\r\n\r\nSubstituting _g_, the symbol for the acceleration of gravity, for _a_ in\r\nthe above formulas, we have: (1) _V_ = _gt_, (2) _S_ = 1/2_gt_², (3) _s_\r\n= 1/2_g_(2_t_ - 1).\r\n\r\n=99. Laws of Falling Bodies.=--These formulas may be stated as follows\r\nfor a body which falls from rest:\r\n\r\n1. The velocity of a freely falling body at the end of any second is\r\nequal to 32.16 ft. per sec. or 980 cm. per second multiplied by the\r\nnumber of the second.\r\n\r\n2. The distance passed through by a freely falling body during any\r\nnumber of seconds is equal to the square of the number of seconds\r\nmultiplied by 16.08 ft. or 490 cm.\r\n\r\n3. The distance passed through by a freely falling body during any\r\nsecond is equal to 16.08 feet or 490 cm. multiplied by one less than\r\ntwice the number of the second.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

The Simple Pendulum.=--Any body suspended so as to swing freely to\r\nand fro is a pendulum, as in Fig. 81. A simple pendulum is defined as a\r\nsingle particle of matter suspended by a cord without weight. It is of\r\ncourse impossible to construct such a pendulum. A small metal ball\r\nsuspended by a thread is approximately a simple pendulum. When allowed\r\nto swing its vibrations are made in equal times. This feature of the\r\nmotion of a pendulum was first noticed by Galileo while watching the\r\nslow oscillations of a bronze chandelier suspended in the Cathedral in\r\nPisa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81--A simple pendulum.]\r\n\r\n=101. Definition of Terms.= _The center of suspension_ is the point\r\nabout which the pendulum swings. A _single vibration_ is one swing\r\nacross the arc. A _complete_ or _double_ vibration is the swing across\r\nthe arc and back again. The time required for a double vibration is\r\ncalled the _period_. The _length_ of a simple pendulum is approximately\r\nthe distance from the point of support to the center of the bob.\r\n\r\nA _seconds pendulum_ is one making a single vibration per second. Its\r\nlength at sea-level, at New York is 99.31 cm. or 39.1 in., at the\r\nequator 39.01 in., at the poles 39.22 in.\r\n\r\nA _compound pendulum_ is one having an appreciable portion of its mass\r\nelsewhere than in the small compact body or sphere called a bob. The\r\nordinary clock pendulum or a meter stick suspended by one end are\r\nexamples of compound pendulums.\r\n\r\nThe _amplitude_ of a vibration is one-half the arc through which it\r\nswings, for example, the arc _DC_ or the angle _DAC_ in Fig. 81.\r\n\r\n=102. Laws of the Pendulum.=--The following laws may be stated:\r\n\r\n1. The period of a pendulum is not affected by its mass or the material\r\nof which the pendulum is made.\r\n\r\n2. For small amplitudes, the period is not affected by the length of the\r\narc through which it swings.\r\n\r\n3. The period is directly proportional to the square root of the length.\r\nExpressed mathematically, _t_/_t´_ = √_l_/√_l´_.\r\n\r\n=103. Uses of the Pendulum.=--The chief use of the pendulum is to\r\nregulate motion in clocks. The wheels are kept in motion by a spring or\r\na weight and the regulation is effected by an escapement (Fig. 82). At\r\neach vibration of the pendulum one tooth of the wheel _D_ slips past the\r\nprong at one end of the escapement _C_, at the same time giving a slight\r\npush to the escapement. This push transmitted to the pendulum keeps it\r\nin motion. In this way, the motion of the wheel work and the hands is\r\ncontrolled. Another use of the pendulum is in finding the acceleration\r\nof gravity, by using the formula, _t_ = π√(_l_/_g_), in which _t_ is the\r\ntime in seconds of a single vibration and _l_ the length of the\r\npendulum. If, for example, the length of the seconds pendulum is 99.31\r\ncm., then 1 = π√(99.31/_g_); squaring both sides of the equation, we\r\nhave 1² = π²(99.31/_g_), or _g_ = π² × 99.31/1² = 980.1 cm. per sec.,\r\nper sec. From this it follows that, since the force of gravity depends\r\nupon the distance from the center of the earth, the pendulum may be used\r\nto determine the elevation of a place above sea level and also the shape\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Removing the bob from a clock pendulum has what effect on its motion?\r\nAlso on the motion of the hands?\r\n\r\n3. How does the expansion of the rod of a pendulum in summer and its\r\ncontraction in winter affect the keeping of time by a clock? How can\r\nthis be corrected?\r\n\r\n4. Master clocks that control the time of a railway system have a cup of\r\nmercury for a bob. This automatically keeps the same rate of vibration\r\nthrough any changes of temperature. How?\r\n\r\n5. How will the length of a seconds pendulum at Denver, 1 mile above\r\nsea-level, compare with one at New York? Why?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82--Escapement and pendulum of a clock.]\r\n\r\n6.

Work._--\"Whenever a force moves a body upon which it acts, it is\r\nsaid to do work upon that body.\" For example, if a man pushes a\r\nwheelbarrow along a path, he is doing work on it as long as the\r\nwheelbarrow moves, but if the wheelbarrow strikes a stone and the man\r\ncontinues to push and no motion results, from a scientific point of view\r\nhe is then doing no work on it.\r\n\r\n\"Work signifies the overcoming of resistance,\" and unless the resistance\r\nis overcome no work is done. Lifting a weight is doing work on it,\r\nsupporting a weight is not, although the latter may be nearly as\r\ntiresome as the former. Work as used in science is a technical term. Do\r\nnot attach to it meanings which it has in every-day speech.\r\n\r\n=105. Measurement of Work.=--Work is measured by the product of the\r\nforce by the displacement caused in the direction of the force, that is\r\n_W_ = _fs_. Therefore if a unit of force acts through a unit of space, a\r\nunit of work will be done. There are naturally several units of work\r\ndepending upon the units of force and space employed.\r\n\r\n_English Work Unit._--If the force of one _pound_ acts through the\r\ndistance of one _foot_, a _foot-pound_ of work is done. A foot-pound is\r\ndefined as the work done when 1 lb. is lifted 1 ft. against the force of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n_Metric Work Unit._--If the force is one _kilogram_ and the distance one\r\n_meter_, _one kilogram-meter_ of work is done.\r\n\r\n_Absolute Work Unit._--If the force of one _dyne_ acts through the\r\ndistance of one _centimeter_ a _dyne-centimeter_ of work is done. This\r\nusually is called an i. Other work units are sometimes used depending\r\nupon the force and distance units employed. One, the i, is equal to\r\n10,000,000 ergs or 10⁷ ergs.\r\n\r\n     =Problem.=--If a load is drawn 2 miles by a team exerting 500 lbs.\r\n     force, how much work is done?\r\n\r\n     =Solution.=--Since the force employed is 500 lbs., and the distance\r\n     is 2 × 5280 ft., the work done is 500 × 2 × 5280 or 5,280,000\r\n     ft.-lbs.\r\n\r\n=106. Energy.=--In the various cases suggested in the paragraphs upon\r\nwork, an agent, a man, an animal or a machine, was mentioned as putting\r\nforth an effort in order to do the work. It is also true that in order\r\nto perform work an agent must employ _energy, or the energy of a body is\r\nits capacity for doing work_. Where an agent does work upon a body, as\r\nin winding up a spring or in lifting a weight, the body upon which the\r\nwork has been done may acquire energy by having work done upon it. That\r\nis, it may become able to do work itself upon some other body. For\r\ninstance, a lifted weight in falling back to its first position may turn\r\nwheels, or drive a post into the ground against resistance; a coiled\r\nspring may run clock work, strike a blow, or close a door. Hence the\r\nenergy, or the capacity for doing work, is often acquired by a body\r\nbecause work has first been done upon that body.\r\n\r\n=107. Potential Energy.=--The wound up spring may do work because work\r\nhas first been done upon it. The lifted weight may also do work because\r\nwork has first been done in raising it to its elevated position since in\r\nfalling it may grind an object to powder, lift another weight or do some\r\nother kind of work. _The energy that a body possesses on account of its\r\nposition or shape and a stress to which it is subjected is called\r\npotential energy._ The potential energy of a body is measured by the\r\nwork done in lifting it, changing its shape, or by bringing about the\r\nconditions by which it can do work. Thus if a block of iron weighing\r\n2000 lbs. is lifted 20 ft., it possesses 40,000 ft.-lbs. of potential\r\nenergy. It is therefore able to do 40,000 ft.-lbs. of work in falling\r\nback to its first position. If the block just mentioned should fall from\r\nits elevated position upon a post, it could drive the post into the\r\nground because its motion at the instant of striking enables it to do\r\nwork. To compute potential energy you compute the work done upon the\r\nbody. That is, _P.E._ = _w_ × _h_ or _f_ × _s_.\r\n\r\n=108. Kinetic Energy.=--_The energy due to the motion of a body is\r\ncalled kinetic energy_. The amount of kinetic energy in a body may be\r\nmeasured by the amount of work done to put it in motion. It is usually\r\ncomputed, however, by using its mass and velocity on striking. To\r\nillustrate, a 100-lb. ball is lifted 16 ft. The work done upon it, and\r\nhence its potential energy, is 1600 ft.-lbs. On falling to the ground\r\nagain, this will be changed into kinetic energy, or there will be 1600\r\nft.-lbs. of kinetic energy on striking. It will be noted that since\r\nenergy is measured by the work it can do, work units are always used in\r\nmeasuring energy. To compute the kinetic energy of a falling body by\r\nsimply using its mass and velocity one proceeds as follows, in solving\r\nthe above problem:\r\n\r\n     First, find the velocity of the falling body which has fallen 16\r\n     ft. A body falls 16 ft. in _one_ second. In this time it gains a\r\n     velocity of 32 ft. per second. Now using the formula for kinetic\r\n     energy _K.E._ = _wv_²/(2_g_), we have _K.E._ = 100 × 32 × 32/(2 ×\r\n     32) = 1600 ft.-lbs. as before. The formula, _K.E._ = _wv_²/(2_g_),\r\n     may be derived in the following manner:\r\n\r\n     The kinetic energy of a falling body equals the work done in giving\r\n     it its motion, that is, _K.E._ = _w_ × _S_, in which, _w_ = the\r\n     weight of the body and _S_ = the distance the body must fall freely\r\n     in order to acquire its velocity. The distance fallen by a freely\r\n     falling body, _S_, = 1/2_gt_² = _g_²_t_²/(2_g_) (Art. 98, p. 111).\r\n     Now, _v_ = _gt_ and _v_² = _g_²_t_².\r\n\r\n     Substituting for _g_²_t_², its equal _v_², we have _S_ =\r\n     _v_²/(2_g_). Substituting this value of S in the equation _K.E._ =\r\n     _w_ × _S_, we have _K.E._ = _wv_²/(2_g_).\r\n\r\n     Since the kinetic energy of a moving body depends upon its mass and\r\n     velocity and not upon the _direction_ of motion, this formula may\r\n     be used to find the kinetic energy of any moving body. Mass and\r\n     weight in such problems may be considered numerically equal.\r\n\r\n     =Important Topics=\r\n\r\n     1. Work defined.\r\n\r\n     2.

A 40 kg. stone is placed upon the top of a chimney 50 meters\r\n     high. Compute the work done in kilogram-meters and foot-pounds.\r\n\r\n     (2) POWER AND ENERGY\r\n\r\n=109. Horse-power.=--In computing work, no account is taken of the time\r\nrequired to accomplish it. But since the time needed to perform an\r\nundertaking is of much importance, the rate of work, or the _power or\r\nactivity_ of an agent is an important factor. Thus if one machine can do\r\na piece of work in one-fifth the time required by another machine, it is\r\nsaid to have five times the power of the other. Therefore the power of a\r\nmachine is _the rate at which it can do work_. James Watt (1736-1819),\r\nthe inventor of the steam-engine, in _expressing_ the power of his\r\nengine, used as a unit a _horse-power_. He considered that a horse could\r\ndo 33,000 ft.-lbs. of work a minute. This is equal to 550 ft.-lbs. per\r\nsecond or 76.05 kg.-m. per second. This is too high a value but it has\r\nbeen used ever since his time. Steam engines usually have their power\r\nrated in horse-power. That is, locomotives produce from 500 to 1500\r\nhorse-power. Some stationary and marine engines develop as high as\r\n25,000 horse-power. The power of an average horse is about 3/4\r\nhorse-power and of a man about 1/7 horse-power when working continuously\r\nfor several hours.\r\n\r\n=110. The Watt.=--In the metric system, the erg as a unit of work would\r\ngive as a unit of power 1 erg per second. This amount is so small,\r\nhowever, that a larger unit is usually employed, the practical unit\r\nbeing 10,000,000 ergs a second, that is, one joule per second. (See Art.\r\n105.) This practical unit is called a _Watt_ after James Watt. The\r\npower of dynamos is usually expressed in kilowatts, a kilowatt\r\nrepresenting 1000 watts. Steam-engines in modern practice are often\r\nrated in kilowatts instead of horse-power. A horse-power is equivalent\r\nto 746 watts, or is nearly 3/4 of a kilowatt.\r\n\r\n=111. Energy. Its Transference and Transformation.= We have considered\r\nenergy as the capacity for doing work, and noted the two kinds,\r\npotential and kinetic, and the facility with which one may change into\r\nanother. In fact, the transference of energy from one body to another,\r\nand its transformation from one form to another is one of the most\r\ncommon processes in nature. Take a pendulum in motion, at the _end_ of a\r\nswing, its energy being entirely due to its elevated position is all\r\n_potential_; at the _lowest_ point in its path its energy being entirely\r\ndue to its motion is all _kinetic_. The change goes on automatically as\r\nlong as the pendulum swings. A motor attached by a belt to a washing\r\nmachine is started running. The energy of the motor is transferred by\r\nthe belt to the washer where it is used in rubbing and moving the\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nThe heat used in warming a house is usually obtained by burning coal or\r\nwood. Coal is believed to be formed from the remains of plants that grew\r\nin former geologic times. These plants grew through the help of the\r\nradiant energy of the sun. The following are transformations of energy\r\nthat have occurred: The radiant energy of sunlight was transformed into\r\nthe _chemical_ energy of the plants. This remained as chemical energy\r\nwhile the plants were being converted into coal, was mined, brought to\r\nthe stove or furnace and burned. The burning transformed the chemical\r\nenergy into heat energy in which form we use it for warming rooms. Take\r\nthe energy used in running a street car whose electrical energy comes\r\nfrom a waterfall. The energy of the car itself is mechanical. Its\r\nmotor, however, receives electrical energy and transforms it into\r\nmechanical. This electrical energy comes along a wire from a dynamo at\r\nthe waterfall, where water-wheels and generators transform into\r\nelectrical energy the mechanical energy of the falling water. The water\r\nobtained its energy of position by being evaporated by the heat of the\r\nradiant energy of the sun. The vapor rising into the air is condensed\r\ninto clouds and rain, and falling on the mountain side, has, from its\r\nelevated position, potential energy. The order of transformation,\r\ntherefore, is in this case, radiant, heat, mechanical, electrical, and\r\nmechanical. Can you trace the energy from the sun step by step to the\r\nenergy you are using in reading this page?\r\n\r\n=112. Forms of Energy.=--A steam-engine attached to a train of cars\r\nemploys its energy in setting the cars in motion, _i.e._, in giving them\r\nkinetic energy and in overcoming resistance to motion. But what is the\r\nsource of the energy of the engine? It is found in the coal which it\r\ncarries in its tender. But of what kind? Surely not kinetic, as no\r\nmotion is seen. It is therefore potential. What is the source of the\r\nenergy of the coal? This question leads us back to the time of the\r\nformation of coal beds, when plants grew in the sunlight and stored up\r\nthe energy of the sun's heat and light as _chemical_ energy. The sun's\r\nlight brings to the earth the energy of the sun, that central storehouse\r\nof energy, which has supplied nearly all the available energy upon the\r\nearth. Five _forms_ of energy are known, viz., mechanical, heat,\r\nelectrical, radiant, and chemical.\r\n\r\n=113. Energy Recognized by its Effects.=--Like force, energy is\r\ninvisible and we are aware of the forms only by the effects produced by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe recognize _heat_ by _warming_, by expansion, by pressure.\r\n\r\nWe recognize _light_ by _warming_, by its affecting vision.\r\n\r\nWe recognize _electrical_ energy by its heat, light, motion, or magnetic\r\neffect. We recognize _mechanical_ energy by the _motion_ that it\r\nproduces. We recognize _chemical_ energy by knowing that the source of\r\nenergy does not belong to any of the foregoing.\r\n\r\nA boy or girl is able to do considerable work. They therefore possess\r\nenergy. In what form does the energy of the body mainly occur? One can\r\ndetermine this for himself by applying questions to each form of energy\r\nin turn as in Art. 114.\r\n\r\n_114. Source of the Energy of the Human Body._--Is the energy of the\r\nhuman body mostly heat? No, since we are not very warm. Is it light or\r\nelectrical? Evidently not since we are neither luminous nor electrical.\r\nIs it mechanical? No, since we have our energy even when at rest. Is it\r\nchemical? It must be since it is none of the others. Chemical energy is\r\ncontained within the molecule.\r\n\r\nIt is a form of potential energy and it is believed to be due to the\r\nposition of the atoms within the molecule. As a tightly coiled watch\r\nspring may have much energy within it, which is set free on allowing the\r\nspring to uncoil, so the chemical energy is released on starting the\r\nchemical _reaction_. Gunpowder and dynamite are examples of substances\r\ncontaining chemical energy. On exploding these, heat, light, and motion\r\nare produced. Gasoline, kerosene, and illuminating gas are purchased\r\nbecause of the potential energy they contain. This energy is set free by\r\nburning or exploding them.\r\n\r\nThe source of the energy of our bodies is of course the food we eat. The\r\nenergy contained in the food is also chemical. Vegetables obtain their\r\nenergy from the sunlight (radiant energy). This is why plants will not\r\ngrow in the dark. The available energy is mostly contained in the form\r\nof starch, sugar and oil. Digestion is employed principally to dissolve\r\nthese substances so that the blood may absorb them and carry them to the\r\ntissues of the body where they are needed. The energy is set free by\r\noxidation (burning), the oxygen needed for this being supplied by\r\nbreathing. Breathing also removes the carbon dioxide, which results from\r\nthe combustion. It is for its energy that our food is mostly required.\r\n\r\n=115. Conservation of Energy.=--In the study of matter we learned that\r\nit is indestructible. Energy is also believed to be indestructible. This\r\nprinciple stated concisely teaches that _despite the innumerable changes\r\nwhich energy undergoes the amount in the universe is unchangeable_, and\r\nwhile energy may leave the earth and be lost as far as we are concerned,\r\nthat it exists somewhere in some form. The principle which teaches this\r\nis called the \"Conservation of Energy.\" The form into which energy is\r\nfinally transformed is believed to be heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Machines and Their Uses.=--A man, while standing on the ground,\r\ncan draw a flag to the top of a pole, by using a rope passing over a\r\npulley.\r\n\r\nA boy can unscrew a tightly fitting nut that he cannot move with his\r\nfingers, by using a wrench.\r\n\r\nA woman can sew a long seam by using a sewing machine in much less time\r\nthan by hand.\r\n\r\nA girl can button her shoes much quicker and easier with a button-hook\r\nthan with her fingers.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations show some of the reasons why machines are used. In\r\nfact it is almost impossible to do any kind of work efficiently without\r\nusing one or more machines.\r\n\r\n=117. Advantages of Machines.=--(a) Many machines make possible an\r\n_increased speed_ as in a sewing machine or a bicycle.\r\n\r\n(b) Other machines exert an _increased force_. A rope and a set of\r\npulleys may enable a man to lift a heavy object such as a safe or a\r\npiano. By the use of a bar a man can more easily move a large rock. (See\r\nFig. 83.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--The rock is easily moved.]\r\n\r\n(c) The _direction_ of a force may be changed thus enabling work to be\r\ndone that could not be readily accomplished otherwise. As, e.g., the use\r\nof a pulley in raising a flag to the top of a flag pole, or in raising a\r\nbucket of ore from a mine by using a horse attached to a rope passing\r\nover two or more pulleys. (See Fig. 84.)\r\n\r\n(d) _Other agents_ than man or animals _can be used_ such as\r\nelectricity, water power, the wind, steam, etc. Fig. 85 represents a\r\nwindmill often used in pumping water.\r\n\r\n_A machine is a device for transferring or transforming energy._ It is\r\nusually therefore an instrument for doing work. An electric motor is a\r\nmachine since it _transforms_ the energy of the electric current into\r\nmotion or mechanical energy, and _transfers_ the energy from the wire to\r\nthe driving pulley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--The horse lifts the bucket of ore.]\r\n\r\n=118. A Machine Cannot Create Energy.=--Whatever does work upon a\r\nmachine (a man, moving water, wind, etc.) loses energy which is employed\r\nin doing the work of the machine. A pair of shears is a machine since it\r\ntransfers energy from the hand to the edges that do the cutting. Our own\r\nbodies are often considered as machines since they both transfer and\r\ntransform energy.\r\n\r\nWe must keep in mind that _a machine cannot create energy_. The\r\nprinciple of \"Conservation of Energy\" is just as explicit on one side as\r\nthe other. Just as energy, cannot be destroyed, so energy cannot be\r\ncreated. A machine can give out no more energy than is given to it. It\r\nacts simply as an agent in transferring energy from one body to\r\nanother. Many efforts have been made to construct machines that when\r\nonce started will run themselves, giving out more energy than they\r\nreceive. Such efforts, called seeking for _perpetual motion_, have never\r\nsucceeded. This fact is strong evidence in favor of the principle of the\r\nconservation of energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--A windmill.]\r\n\r\n=119. Law of Machines.=--When a body receives energy, work is done upon\r\nit. Therefore work is done upon a machine when it receives energy and\r\nthe machine does work upon the body to which it gives the energy. In the\r\noperation of a machine, therefore, two quantities of work are to be\r\nconsidered and by the principle of the conservation of energy, these two\r\nmust be equal. _The work done by a machine equals the work done upon it,\r\nor the energy given out by a machine equals the energy received by it._\r\nThese two quantities of work must each be composed of a _force_ factor\r\nand a _space_ factor. Therefore two forces and two spaces are to be\r\nconsidered in the operation of a machine. The force factor of the work\r\ndone on the machine is called the _force_ or _effort_. It is the force\r\napplied to the machine. The force factor of the work done by a machine\r\nis called the _weight or resistance_. It is the force exerted by the\r\nmachine in overcoming the resistance and equals the resistance\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nIf _f_ represents the force or effort, and _D_{f}_ the space it acts\r\nthrough, and _w_ represents the weight or resistance, and _D_{w}_ the\r\nspace it acts through, then the law of machines may be expressed by an\r\nequation, _f × D_{f} = w × D_{w}_. That is, _the effort times the\r\ndistance the effort acts equals the resistance times the distance the\r\nresistance is moved or overcome_. When the product of two numbers equals\r\nthe product of two other numbers either pair may be made the means and\r\nthe other the extremes of a proportion. The equation given above may\r\ntherefore be expressed _w: f = D_{f}: D_{w}_. Or the resistance is to\r\nthe effort as the effort distance is to the resistance distance. The law\r\nof machines may therefore be expressed in several ways. One should keep\r\nin mind, however, that the _same_ law of machines is expressed even\r\nthough the form be different. What two ways of expressing the law are\r\ngiven?\r\n\r\n=120. The Simple Machines.=--There are but six _simple machines_. All\r\nthe varieties of machines known are simply modifications and\r\ncombinations of the six simple machines. The six simple machines are\r\nmore easily remembered if we separate them into two groups of three\r\neach. The first or _lever_ group consists of those machines in which a\r\npart revolves about a fixed axis. It contains the _lever_, _pulley_ and\r\n_wheel and axle_. The second or _inclined plane group_ includes those\r\nhaving a sloping surface. It contains the _inclined plane_, the _wedge_,\r\nand the _screw_.\r\n\r\n=121. The Lever.=--The _lever_ is one of the simple machines most\r\nfrequently used, being seen in scissors, broom, coal shovel, whip,\r\nwheelbarrow, tongs, etc. _The lever consists of a rigid bar capable of\r\nturning about a fixed axis called the fulcrum._ In studying a lever, one\r\nwishes to know what weight or resistance it can overcome when a certain\r\nforce is applied to it. Diagrams of levers, therefore, contain the\r\nletters _w_ and _f_. In addition to these, _O_ stands for the fulcrum\r\non which it turns. By referring to Fig. 86, _a_, _b_, _c_, one may\r\nnotice that each of these may occupy the middle position between the\r\nother two. The two forces (other than the one exerted by the fulcrum)\r\nacting on a lever always oppose each other in the matter of changing\r\nrotation. They may be considered as a pair of parallel forces acting on\r\na body, each tending to produce rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--The three classes of levers.]\r\n\r\n=122. Moment of Force.=--The _effectiveness_ of each force may therefore\r\nbe determined by computing its _moment_ about the fixed axis (see Art.\r\n84), that is, by multiplying each force by its distance to the fulcrum\r\nor axis of rotation. Let a meter stick have a small hole bored through\r\nit at the 50 cm. mark near one edge, and let it be mounted on a nail\r\ndriven into a vertical support and balanced by sliding a bent wire along\r\nit. Suspend by a fine wire or thread a 100 g. weight, 15 cm. from the\r\nnail and a 50 g. weight 30 cm. from the nail, on the other side of the\r\nsupport. These two weights will be found to balance. When viewed from\r\nthis side _A_ (Fig. 87) tends to turn the lever in a clockwise direction\r\n(down at right), _B_ in the counter-clockwise direction (down at left).\r\nSince the lever balances, the forces have equal and opposite effects in\r\nchanging its rotation as may also be computed by determining the moment\r\nof each force by multiplying each by its distance from the fulcrum.\r\nTherefore the _effectiveness_ of a force in changing rotation depends\r\nupon the distance from it to the axis as well as upon the magnitude of\r\nthe force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--The two moments are equal about _C_. 100 × 15 =\r\n50 × 30.]\r\n\r\nFrom the experiment just described, the moment of the acting force\r\nequals the moment of the weight or _f × D_{f} = w × D_{w}_, or the\r\neffort times the effort arm equals the weight times the weight arm. This\r\nequation is called the law of the lever. It corresponds to the general\r\nlaw of machines and may also be written _w: f = D_{f}: D_{w}_.\r\n\r\n=123. Mechanical Advantage.=--A lever often gives an advantage because\r\nby its use one may lift a stone or weight which the unaided strength of\r\nman could not move. If the lever is used in lifting a stone weighing 500\r\nlbs., the force available being only 100 lbs., then its _mechanical\r\nadvantage_ would be 5, the ratio of _w:f_. In a similar way, the\r\nmechanical advantage of any machine is found by finding the ratio of the\r\nresistance or weight to the effort. What must be the relative lengths of\r\nthe effort arm and resistance or weight arm in the example just\r\nmentioned? Since the effort times the effort arm equals the weight times\r\nthe weight arm, if _f × D_{f} = w × D_{w}_, then _D_{f}_ is five times\r\n_D_{w}_. Hence the mechanical advantage of a lever is easily found by\r\nfinding the ratio of the effort arm to the weight arm.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Advantage of machines.\r\n\r\n2.

The Wheel and Axle.=--1. One of the simple machines most commonly\r\napplied in compound machines is the _wheel_ and _axle_. It consists of a\r\nwheel _H_ mounted on a cylinder _Y_ so fastened together that both turn\r\non the same axis. In Fig. 90, ropes are shown attached to the\r\ncircumferences of the wheel and axle. Sometimes a hand wheel is used as\r\non the brake of a freight or street car, or simply a crank and handle is\r\nused, as in Fig. 91. The _capstan_ is used in moving buildings.\r\nSometimes two or three wheels and axles are geared together as on a\r\nderrick or crane as in Fig. 92.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--The wheel and axle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Windlass used in drawing water from a well.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--A portable crane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--The wheel and axle considered as a lever.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--View of transmission gears in an automobile. 1,\r\nDrive gear; 2, High and intermediate gear; 3, Low and reverse gear; 4,\r\n8, Reverse idler gears; 5, 6, 7, Countershaft gears. (_Courtesy of the\r\nAutomobile Journal_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Reducing gear of a steam turbine.]\r\n\r\nFig. 93 is a diagram showing that the wheel and axle acts like a lever.\r\nThe axis _D_ is the fulcrum, the effort is applied at _F_, at the\r\nextremity of a radius of the wheel and the resisting weight _W_ at the\r\nextremity of a radius of the axle. Hence, if _D_{f}_, the effort\r\ndistance, is three times _D_{w}_, the weight distance, the weight that\r\ncan be supported is three times the effort. Here as in the lever, _f ×\r\nD_{f} = w × D_{w}_, or _w:f = D_{f}:D_{w}_, or _the ratio of the weight\r\nto the effort equals the ratio of the radius of the wheel to the radius\r\nof the axle_. This is therefore the mechanical advantage of the wheel\r\nand axle. Since the diameters or circumferences are in the same ratio as\r\nthe radii these can be used instead of the radii. Sometimes, when\r\n_increased speed_ instead of increased force is desired, the radius of\r\nthe wheel or part to which power is applied is less than that of the\r\naxle. This is seen in the bicycle, buzzsaw, and blower. Sometimes geared\r\nwheels using the principle of the wheel and axle are used to reduce\r\nspeed, as in the _transmission_ of an automobile (see Fig. 94), or the\r\nreducing gear of a steam turbine. (See Figs. 95 and 293.)\r\n\r\nA _bevel gear_ is frequently used to change the direction of the force.\r\n(See Fig. 94.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--A single movable pulley.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Block and tackle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--The fixed pulley considered as a lever.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--The movable pulley considered as a lever.]\r\n\r\n=125. The Pulley.=--The _pulley_ consists of a wheel turning on an axis\r\nin a frame. The wheel is called a sheave and the frame a block. The rim\r\nmay be smooth or grooved. The grooved rim is used to hold a cord or\r\nrope. One use of the pulley is to change the _direction_ of the acting\r\nforce as in Fig. 84, where pulley _B_ changes a horizontal pull at _H_\r\nto a downward force and pulley _A_ changes this into an upward force\r\nlifting the weight _W_. These pulleys are fixed and simply change the\r\ndirection. Without considering the loss by friction, the pull at _W_\r\nwill equal that at _F_. Sometimes, a pulley is attached to the weight\r\nand is lifted with it. It is then called a _movable pulley_. In Fig. 96\r\nthe _movable pulley_ is at _P_, a fixed pulley is at _F_. When _fixed\r\npulleys_ are used, a single cord runs through from the weight to the\r\neffort, so that if a force of 100 lbs. is applied by the effort the same\r\nforce is received at the weight. But with movable pulleys several\r\nsections of cord may extend upward from the weight each with the force\r\nof the effort upon it. By this arrangement, a weight several times\r\nlarger than the effort can be lifted. Fig. 97 represents what is called\r\na _block and tackle_. If a force of 50 lbs. is exerted at _F_, each\r\nsection of the rope will have the same tension and hence the six\r\nsections of the rope will support 300 lbs. weight. The _mechanical\r\nadvantage of the pulley_ or the _ratio of the weight_ to the effort,\r\ntherefore, _equals the number of sections of cord supporting the\r\nweight_. The fixed pulley represents a lever, see Fig. 98, where the\r\neffort and weight are equal. In the movable pulley, the fulcrum (see\r\nFig. 99) is at _D_; the weight, _W_, is applied at the center of the\r\npulley and the effort at _F_. The weight distance, _D_{w}_, is the\r\nradius, and the effort distance, _D_{f}_, is the diameter of the\r\npulley. Since _W/F = D_{f} / D_{w} = 2_ in a movable pulley, the weight\r\nis twice the effort, or its mechanical advantage is 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Efficiency.=--The general law of machines which states that the\r\nwork done by a machine equals the work put into it requires a\r\nmodification, when we apply the law in a practical way, for the reason\r\nthat in using any machine there is developed more or less friction due\r\nto parts of the machine rubbing on each other and to the resistance of\r\nthe air as the parts move through it. Hence the statement of the law\r\nthat accords with actual working conditions runs somewhat as follows:\r\n_The work put into a machine equals the useful work done by the machine\r\nplus the wasted work done by it._ The _efficiency_ of a machine is the\r\nratio of the _useful_ work done by it to the _total_ work done on the\r\nmachine. If there were no friction or wasted work, the efficiency would\r\nbe perfect, or, as it is usually expressed, would be 100 per cent.\r\nConsider a system of pulleys into which are put 600 ft.-lbs. of work.\r\nWith 450 ft.-lbs. of useful work resulting, the efficiency would be 450\r\n÷ 600 = {3/4}, or 75 per cent. In this case 25 per cent. of the work\r\ndone on the machine is wasted. In a simple lever the friction is slight\r\nso that nearly 100 per cent. efficiency is often secured.\r\n\r\nSome forms of the wheel and axle have high efficiencies as in bicycles\r\nwith gear wheels. Other forms in which ropes are employed have more\r\nfriction. Pulleys have sometimes efficiencies as low as 40 per cent.\r\nwhen heavy ropes are used.\r\n\r\n=127. Inclined Plane.=--We now come to a type of _simple machine of\r\nlower efficiency_ than those previously mentioned. These belong to the\r\ninclined plane group, which includes the inclined plane (see Fig. 101),\r\nthe wedge and the screw. They are extensively used, however,\r\nnotwithstanding their low efficiency, on account of often giving a high\r\nmechanical advantage. The _relation between these machines may be easily\r\nshown_, as the _wedge_ is obviously _a double inclined plane_. In Art.\r\n82 it is shown that the effort required to hold a weight upon an\r\ninclined plane is to the _weight_ supported as the _height_ of the plane\r\nis to its _length_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--An inclined plane.]\r\n\r\nOr while the weight is being lifted the vertical height _BC_, the effort\r\nhas to move the length of the plane _AC_. Since by the law of machines\r\nthe effort times its distance equals the weight times its distance, or\r\nthe weight is to the effort as the effort distance is to the weight\r\ndistance, therefore the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane is\r\nthe ratio of the length to the height of the inclined plane.\r\n\r\n_Inclined planes_ are used to raise heavy objects short distances, as\r\nbarrels into a wagon, and iron safes into a building. Stairways are\r\ninclined planes with steps cut into them.\r\n\r\n=128. The Wedge.=--Wedges are used to separate objects, as in splitting\r\nwood (see Fig. 102), cutting wood, and where great force is to be\r\nexerted for short distances. An axe is a wedge, so is a knife. A fork\r\nconsists of several round wedges set in a handle. The edge of any\r\ncutting tool is either an inclined plane or a wedge. Our front teeth are\r\nwedges. Numerous examples of inclined planes may be seen about us.\r\n\r\nNo definite statement as to the mechanical advantage of the wedge can be\r\ngiven as the work done depends largely on friction. The force used is\r\ngenerally applied by blows on the thick end. In general, the longer the\r\nwedge for a given thickness the greater the mechanical advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--One use of the wedge.]\r\n\r\n=129. The Screw.=--The screw is a cylinder around whose circumference\r\nwinds a spiral groove. (See Fig. 103.) The raised part between the two\r\nadjacent grooves is the =thread= of the screw. The screw turns in a\r\nblock called a =nut=, within which is a spiral groove and thread exactly\r\ncorresponding to those of the screw. The distance between two\r\nconsecutive threads measured parallel to the axis is called the =pitch=\r\nof the screw. (See Fig. 104.) If the thread winds around the cylinder\r\nten times in the space of 1 in., the screw is said to have ten threads\r\nto the inch, the pitch being {1/10} in. The screw usually is turned by\r\na lever or wheel with the effort applied at the end of the lever, or at\r\nthe circumference of the wheel. While the effort moves once about the\r\ncircumference of the wheel the weight is pushed forward a distance equal\r\nto the distance between two threads (the pitch of the screw). The work\r\ndone by the effort therefore equals _F × 2πr_, _r_ being the radius of\r\nthe wheel, and the work done on the weight equals _W × s_, _s_ being the\r\npitch of the screw. By the law of machines _F × 2πr = W × s_ or _W / F =\r\n(2πr) / s_. Therefore the mechanical advantage of the screw equals\r\n_(2πr) / s_. Since the distance the weight moves is small compared to\r\nthat the power travels, there is a great gain in force. The screw is\r\nusually employed where _great force_ is to be exerted through small\r\ndistances as in the vise (Fig. 105) the jack screw (Fig. 106), screw\r\nclamps, to accurately measure small distances as in the micrometer (Fig.\r\n107) and spherometer, and to lessen the motion in speed-reducing\r\ndevices. The worm gear (Fig. 108) is a modification of the screw that is\r\nsometimes used where a considerable amount of speed reduction is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--The screw is a spiral inclined plane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--The pitch is _S_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--A vise.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--A jack screw.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--A micrometer screw.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--This large worm-wheel is a part of the\r\nhoisting mechanism employed for the lock gates of the Sault Ste. Marie\r\nCanal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Efficiency of machines.\r\n\r\n2. The inclined plane, wedge and screw. Applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1.

Friction.=--Although often inconvenient and expensive, requiring\r\npersistent and elaborate efforts to reduce it to a minimum, friction has\r\nits uses, and advantages. Were it not for friction between our shoes and\r\nthe floor or sidewalk, we could not keep our footing. _Friction is the\r\nresistance that must be overcome when one body moves over another._ It\r\nis of two kinds, _sliding_ and _rolling_. If one draws a block and then\r\na car of equal weight along a board, the force employed in each case\r\nbeing measured by a spring balance, a large difference in the force\r\nrequired will be noticed, showing how much less rolling friction is than\r\nsliding friction.\r\n\r\n=131. Ways of Reducing Friction.=--(a) Friction is often caused by the\r\nminute projections of one surface sinking into the depressions of the\r\nother surface as one moves over the other. It follows, therefore, that\r\nif these projections could be made as small as possible that friction\r\nwould be lessened. Consequently _polishing_ is one of the best means for\r\nreducing friction. In machines all moving surfaces are made as smooth as\r\npossible. In different kinds of materials these little ridges and\r\ndepressions are differently arranged. (b) In Fig. 109 the friction\r\nbetween _R_ and _S_ would be greater than between _R_ and _T_. In _R_\r\nand _S_ the surfaces will fit closer together than in _R_ and _T_. The\r\n_use of different materials will reduce friction_. The iron axles of car\r\nwheels revolve in bearings of brass. Jewels are used in watches for the\r\nsame reason. (c) Another very common method of reducing friction is by\r\nthe use of _lubricants_. The oil or grease used fills up the\r\nirregularities of the bearing surfaces and separates them. _Rolling\r\nfriction_ is frequently substituted for sliding friction by the use of\r\nball and roller bearings. These are used in many machines as in\r\nbicycles, automobiles, sewing machines, etc. (See Fig. 110.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--The friction between _R_ and _S_ is greater\r\nthan between _R_ and _T_.]\r\n\r\n=132. Value of Friction.=--_Friction always hinders motion_ and whenever\r\none body moves over or through another the energy used in overcoming the\r\nfriction is transformed into heat which is taken up by surrounding\r\nbodies and usually lost. Friction is therefore the great obstacle to\r\nperfect efficiency in machines. Friction, however, like most afflictions\r\n_has its uses_. We would find it hard to get along without it. Without\r\nfriction we could neither walk nor run; no machines could be run by\r\nbelts; railroad trains, street cars, in fact all ordinary means of\r\ntravel would be impossible, since these depend upon friction between the\r\nmoving power and the road for propulsion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--Timken roller bearings. As used in the front\r\nwheel of an automobile.]\r\n\r\n=133. Coefficient of Friction.=--The ratio between the friction when\r\nmotion is just starting and the force pushing the surfaces together is\r\ncalled the _coefficient of friction_.\r\n\r\nIf the block in Fig. 111 is drawn along the board with uniform motion,\r\nthe reading of the spring balances indicates the amount of friction.\r\nSuppose the friction is found to be 500 g., and the weight of the block\r\nto be 2000 g. Then the coefficient of friction for these two substances\r\nwill be {500/2000} = {1/4}, or 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n=134. Laws of Friction, Law I.=--_The friction when motion is occurring\r\nbetween two surfaces is proportional to the force holding them\r\ntogether._ Thus if one measures the friction when a brick is drawn along\r\na board, he will find that it is doubled if a second brick is placed on\r\nthe first. On brakes greater pressure causes greater friction. If a rope\r\nis drawn through the hands more pressure makes more friction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--A method for testing the friction between\r\nsurfaces.]\r\n\r\n=Law II.=--_Friction is independent of the extent of surface in\r\ncontact._ Thus a brick has the same friction drawn on its side as on its\r\nedge, since, although the surface is increased, the weight is unchanged.\r\n\r\n=Law III.=--Friction is greatest at starting, but after starting is\r\npractically the same for all speeds.\r\n\r\n=135. Fluid Friction.=--When a solid moves through a fluid, as when a\r\nship moves through the water or railroad trains through the air, the\r\nresistance encountered is not the same as with solids but increases with\r\nthe square of the velocity for slow speeds and for high speeds at a\r\nhigher rate. This is the reason why it costs so much to increase the\r\nspeed of a fast train, since the resistance of the air becomes the\r\nprominent factor at high speeds. The resistance to the motion of a ship\r\nat high speed is usually considered to increase as the cube of the\r\nvelocity so that to double the speed of a boat its driving force must be\r\neight times as great.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Energy of Falling Water.=--The energy of falling and running water\r\nhas been used from the earliest times for developing power and running\r\nmachinery. The energy is derived from the action of the moving water in\r\nstriking and turning some form of _water-wheel_, several varieties of\r\nwhich are described below.\r\n\r\n=The Overshot Wheel.=--The overshot wheel (Fig. 112) is turned by the\r\nweight of the water in the buckets. It was formerly much used in the\r\nhilly and mountainous sections of this country for running sawmills and\r\ngrist mills as it is very easily made and requires only a small amount\r\nof water. Its efficiency is high, being from 80 to 90 per cent., the\r\nloss being due to friction and spilling of water from the buckets. To\r\nsecure this high efficiency the overshot wheel must have a diameter\r\nequal to the height of the fall which may be as much as 80 or 90 ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Overshot water wheel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Undershot water wheel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--Diagram illustrating the principle of the\r\nPelton wheel.]\r\n\r\n=The Undershot Wheel.=--The old style undershot wheel (Fig. 113) is used\r\nin level countries, where there is little fall, often to raise water for\r\nirrigation. Its efficiency is very low, seldom rising more than 25 per\r\ncent. The principle of the undershot wheel, however, is extensively used\r\nin the water motor and the Pelton wheel (Fig. 114). In these the water\r\nis delivered from a nozzle in a jet against the lower buckets of the\r\nwheel. They have an efficiency of about 80 per cent. and are much used\r\nin cities for running small machines, washing machines, pipe organ\r\nblowers, etc., and in mountainous districts where the head is great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Diagram of a hydro-electric power house\r\nshowing a vertical turbine _A_ with penstock _B_ and tail race _C_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--The outer case of a turbine showing the\r\nmechanism for controlling the gates.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Inner case of a turbine showing the gates and\r\nthe lower end of the runner within.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--The runner of a turbine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Turbine and generator of the Tacoma\r\nhydro-electric power plant.]\r\n\r\n=137. The Turbine.=--The turbine is now used more than any other form of\r\nwater-wheel. It was invented in 1827 by De Fourneyron in France. It can\r\nbe used with a small or large amount of water, the power depending on\r\nthe head (the height of the water, in the reservoir above the wheel). It\r\nis the most efficient type of water-wheel, efficiencies of 90 per cent.\r\noften being obtained. The wheel is entirely under water (Fig. 115). It\r\nis enclosed in an outer case (Fig. 116) which is connected with the\r\nreservoir by a penstock or pipe and is always kept full of water. The\r\nwheel itself is made in two parts, a rotating part called the runner\r\n(see Fig. 118) and an inner case (Fig. 117) with gates that regulate\r\nthe amount of water entering the wheel. This case has blades curved so\r\nthat the water can strike the curved blades of the rotating part (Fig.\r\n118) at the angle that is best adapted to use the energy of the water.\r\nThe water then drops through the central opening into the tail race\r\nbelow (see Fig. 115). The energy available is the product of the weight\r\nof the water and the head. The turbine is extensively used to furnish\r\npower for generating electricity at places where there is a sufficient\r\nfall of water. The electrical energy thus developed is transmitted from\r\n50 to 200 miles to cities where it is used in running street cars,\r\nelectric lighting, etc. Turbines can be made to revolve about either\r\nvertical or horizontal axes. Fig. 119 represents a _horizontal_ water\r\nturbine connected to a dynamo. Compare this with the _vertical_ turbine\r\nin Fig. 115.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1. Does a person do more work when he goes up a flight of stairs in 5\r\nseconds than when he goes up in 15 seconds? Explain.\r\n\r\n2.

Importance of the Study of Heat.=--Heat is brought to our\r\nattention through the sensations of heat and cold. In winter, we warm\r\nour houses and prevent the escape of heat from them as much as possible.\r\nIn summer we endeavor to keep our living rooms cool and our bodies from\r\nbeing overheated.\r\n\r\nA clear understanding of the several _sources_, _effects_, and _modes of\r\ntransferring_ heat is of importance to everyone living in our complex\r\ncivilization, especially when we consider the multitudes of objects that\r\nhave as their principal use the _production, transfer or utilization_ of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n=139. Principal Sources of Heat.=--_First_ and most important is the\r\n_Sun_, which is continually sending to us _radiant energy_ in the form\r\nof light and heat waves. These warm the earth, make plants grow,\r\nevaporate water, besides producing many other important effects.\r\n\r\n_Second_, _chemical energy_ is often transformed into heat. One has but\r\nto think of the heat produced by burning coal, wood, oil, and gas, to\r\nrecognize the importance of this source. Chemical energy is also the\r\nsource of the heat produced within our bodies. The action of quicklime\r\nand water upon each other produces much heat. This action is sometimes\r\nemployed during balloon trips as a means of warming things.\r\n\r\n_Third_, _Electrical Energy_.--In many cities electric cars are heated\r\nby the electric current. We have all heard of electric toasters and\r\nother devices for heating by electricity. _Electric_ light is produced\r\nby the heating of some material to incandescence by an electric current.\r\nThe _electric furnace_ has a wide application in the preparation and\r\nrefining of metals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Boy-scout method of making fire by friction.]\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, heat is also produced whenever _mechanical energy_ of motion\r\nis overcome, whether it be by _friction_, _concussion_, or\r\n_compression_. Friction _always_ results in the production of heat, as\r\nwhen we warm our hands by rubbing them together. When friction is\r\nexcessive, such as in the case of a heavy bearing not properly oiled,\r\nthe bearing may get very hot. This is the cause of the \"hot box\" on a\r\nrailway car. Friction may produce heat enough to set wood on fire. Some\r\nfires in mills are believed to be due to this cause. Every _boy scout_\r\nmust learn how to produce fire by friction. (See Fig. 120.) _Concussion_\r\nmay be illustrated by the heating of a piece of metal by hammering it,\r\nwhile the compression of a gas always makes it warmer, as those who have\r\nused a bicycle pump have observed. The production of heat by compressing\r\na gas is illustrated by the \"fire syringe\" (Fig. 121). This consists of\r\na glass tube with a tightly fitted piston. A sudden compression of the\r\nair contained may ignite a trace of carbon bisulfid vapor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--A fire syringe.]\r\n\r\nThe _interior of the earth_ is hot, but its heat seldom gets to the\r\nsurface except at _hot springs_ and _volcanoes_.\r\n\r\n=140. The Effects of Heat.=--There are five important changes produced\r\nby heat: (a) change of _size_, (b) change of _temperature_, (c) change\r\nof _state_, as the melting of ice or evaporating of water, (d)\r\n_chemical_ change, as the charring of sugar when it is overheated, and\r\n(e) _electrical_ change. This is illustrated by the production of an\r\nelectric current, by the heating of the junction of two different\r\nmetals. A thermo-electric generator (see Fig. 122) has been constructed\r\nupon this principle and works successfully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--A thermo-electric generator.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Which of these costs least for\r\nthe amount of heat furnished? Which is most expensive? How do you\r\ndetermine these answers?\r\n\r\n6. Why do many people buy heat in an expensive form, as in using an\r\nelectric toaster, when they can obtain it in a cheaper form by burning\r\ngas or coal?\r\n\r\n7. How many of the five effects of heat have you observed outside of\r\nschool?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) TEMPERATURE AND EXPANSION\r\n\r\n=141. Heat and Temperature.=--We should now clearly distinguish between\r\nthe terms, _heat_ and _temperature_. Heat is _a form of energy\r\nconsisting of molecular motion_. The temperature of a body is its\r\n_degree of hotness_. The _amount of heat_ present in a body and its\r\n_temperature_ are very different things. The temperature refers to the\r\nintensity of the heat in the body. A quart of water and a red hot iron\r\nball may contain _equal amounts_ of heat, although the ball has a _much\r\nhigher temperature_ than the water. A cup of boiling water will have the\r\nsame temperature as a tank full of boiling water, but the tank will\r\ncontain more heat. Every one knows that it will take longer to boil a\r\nkettle full of water than a cupful. A hot-water bag, holding 2 quarts of\r\nwater will give off heat longer than a 1-quart bag, both being filled\r\nwith water at the same temperature. To put it in another way, more work\r\nis done in heating a large amount of water, than a small amount through\r\nthe same change of temperature.\r\n\r\n=142. Units of Heat and Temperature.=--There are two common units for\r\nmeasuring heat: the _Calorie_ and the _British thermal unit_. The\r\n_calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a\r\ngram of water one centigrade degree_. The British thermal unit is _the\r\namount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water\r\none Fahrenheit degree_. One of the units plainly belongs to the metric\r\nsystem, the other to the English.\r\n\r\nAn instrument for measuring temperature is called a _thermometer_.\r\nVarious scales are placed upon thermometers. The two thermometer scales\r\nmost commonly used in this country are the _Centigrade_ and the\r\n_Fahrenheit_. The _Fahrenheit thermometer scale_ has the temperature of\r\nmelting ice marked 32°. The boiling point or steam temperature of pure\r\nwater under standard conditions of atmospheric pressure is marked 212°\r\nand the space between these two fixed points is divided into 180 parts.\r\n\r\nThe centigrade thermometer scale has the same fixed points marked 0 and\r\n100 and the space between divided into 100 parts. (See Fig. 123.) The\r\ncentigrade scale is the one used by scientists everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Comparison of centigrade and Fahrenheit\r\nscales.]\r\n\r\n=143. Comparison of Thermometer Scales.=--It is often necessary to\r\nexpress in centigrade degrees a temperature for which the Fahrenheit\r\nreading is given or _vice versa_. Since there are 180 Fahrenheit degrees\r\nbetween the \"fixed points\" and 100 centigrade degrees, the Fahrenheit\r\ndegrees are smaller than the centigrade, or 1°F. = 5/9°C. and 1°C. =\r\n9/5°F. One must also take into account the fact that the melting point\r\nof ice on the Fahrenheit scale is marked 32°. Hence the following rule:\r\nTo change a Fahrenheit reading to centigrade subtract 32 and take 5/9\r\nof the remainder, while to change centigrade to Fahrenheit multiply the\r\ncentigrade by 9/5 and add 32 to the product. These two rules are\r\nexpressed by the following formulas.\r\n\r\n     (F.° - 32)5/9 = C.°, 9C.°/5 + 32° = F.°\r\n\r\nAnother method of changing from one thermometric scale to another is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nA temperature of -40°F. is also _represented_ by -40°C., therefore to\r\nchange a Fahrenheit reading into centigrade, we add 40 to the given\r\nreading, then divide by 1.8 after which subtract 40. To change from a\r\ncentigrade to Fahrenheit reading the only difference in this method is\r\nto multiply by 1.8 or\r\n\r\n     C. = (F. + 40)/1.8 - 40 and F. = 1.8(C. + 40) - 40.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124--Comparison of absolute, centigrade and\r\nFahrenheit scales.]\r\n\r\n=144. The Absolute Scale of Temperature.=--One often hears the statement\r\n\"as cold as ice.\" This expresses the incorrect idea that ice cannot\r\nbecome colder than its freezing temperature. The fact is that ice _may\r\nbe cooled_ below freezing down to the temperature of its surroundings.\r\nIf a piece of ice is placed where the temperature is below the melting\r\npoint, the ice, like any other solid, cools to the temperature of the\r\nsurrounding space. For example, a piece of ice out of doors is at 10°F.\r\nwhen the air is at this temperature. It follows then, that when ice has\r\nbeen cooled below the freezing temperature that heat is required to\r\nwarm the ice up to its melting point; or in other words that ice at its\r\nmelting temperature possesses some heat. The temperature at which\r\nabsolutely no heat exists is called _absolute zero_. There has been\r\ndevised an _absolute scale of_ temperature. This scale is based upon the\r\ncentigrade scale, _i.e._, with 100° between the two fixed points; the\r\nscale, however, extends down, below the centigrade zero, 273°, to what\r\nis called _absolute zero_. It follows therefore that upon the absolute\r\nscale, the melting point of ice, and the boiling point of water are 273°\r\nand 373° respectively. (See Fig. 124.)\r\n\r\nThe means employed to find the location of absolute zero are of much\r\ninterest. It has been observed that when heated a gas tends to expand.\r\nIf a measured volume of air at 0°C. is cooled or heated 1°C., it changes\r\nits volume 1/273, the pressure remaining the same. If it is cooled 10°\r\nit loses 10/273, if cooled 100° it loses 100/273 and so on. No matter\r\nhow far it is cooled the same rate of reduction continues as long as it\r\nremains in the gaseous state. From these facts it is concluded that if\r\nthe cooling could be carried down 273° that the volume would be reduced\r\n273/273 or that the volume of the gas would be reduced to nothing. This\r\nis believed to mean that the molecular motion constituting heat would\r\ncease rather than that the matter composing the gas would disappear.\r\nScientists have been able to obtain temperatures of extreme cold far\r\ndown on the absolute scale. Liquid air has a temperature of -292°F., or\r\n-180°C. or 93°A. The lowest temperature thus far reported is 1.7°A. or\r\n-271.3°C., obtained in 1911, by evaporating liquid helium.\r\n\r\n=145. The Law of Charles.=--The facts given in the last paragraph mean\r\nthat if 273 ccm. of a gas at 0°C. or 273° A. are cooled 100°, or to\r\n-100°C., or 173°A., then it will lose 100/273 of its volume or have a\r\nvolume of 173 ccm. If warmed 100°, or up to 100°C., or 373°A., it will\r\nhave a volume of 373 ccm. It follows then that in every case the volume\r\nwill correspond to its absolute temperature, providing the pressure\r\nremains unchanged. The expression of this fact in scientific language is\r\ncalled the law of _Charles_. _At a constant pressure the volume of a\r\ngiven mass of gas is proportional to its absolute temperature._\r\n\r\nExpressed mathematically, we have _V_{1}/V_{2} = T_{1}/T_{2}_. Compare\r\nthe statement and mathematical expression of the laws of Charles and\r\nBoyle.\r\n\r\nThe formulas for the laws of Boyle and Charles are sometimes combined\r\ninto one expression as follows:\r\n\r\n     _PV/T = P´V´/T´_\r\n\r\nor the product of the volume and pressure of a constant mass of gas is\r\nproportional to its absolute temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Explain.\r\n\r\n11. If 200 ccm. of air at 200° absolute is heated to 300°A. under\r\nconstant pressure, what volume will the air occupy at the latter\r\ntemperature?\r\n\r\n12. How does one change a reading on the centigrade scale to a\r\ncorresponding reading on the absolute scale?\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) EXPANSION OF LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS\r\n\r\n=146. Expansion of Gases.=--The law of Charles is found to apply to all\r\ngases. That is, all gases change in volume in proportion to the change\r\nof temperature provided the pressure remains constant. It is for this\r\nreason that we have the _gas thermometer_ (see Fig. 126) which gives in\r\nskillful hands more accurate temperature readings than the best\r\nmercurial thermometer. Galileo devised and used the first _air\r\nthermometer_ which consisted of a hollow bulb blown on a glass tube and\r\ninverted in a dish of water. (See Fig. 1.) The _water thermometer_\r\nconsists of a glass bulb filled with water which rises into a tube\r\nattached to the bulb. One disadvantage of the water thermometer is its\r\nlimited range since it cannot be used below 0° or above 100°. Why?\r\n\r\n=147. Expansion of Liquids.=--The expansion of liquids differs from that\r\nof gases in several important respects:\r\n\r\n(a) Liquids have a smaller rate of expansion than gases. The _rate_ of\r\nexpansion per degree is called the _Coefficient of Expansion_. For\r\nexample, the coefficient of expansion of a gas under constant pressure\r\nat 0°C. is {1/273} of its volume per degree centigrade.\r\n\r\n(b) Different liquids expand at wholly different rates, that is, their\r\ncoefficients of expansion differ widely. For example, the coefficient of\r\nexpansion of mercury is 0.00018 per degree centigrade, of glycerine\r\n0.0005 per degree centigrade, of petroleum 0.0009 per degree centigrade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--Gas thermometer.]\r\n\r\n(c) The same liquid often has different coefficients of expansion at\r\ndifferent temperatures. Water between 5°C. and 6°C. has a coefficient\r\nexpansion of 0.00002 per degree centigrade, between 8° and 50° of\r\n0.0006, between 99° and 100° of 0.00076. The coefficient of expansion of\r\nmercury, however, is constant for a wide range of temperature and,\r\ntherefore, it is well adapted for use in thermometers.\r\n\r\n=148. Peculiarity in the Expansion of Water.=--Water has a peculiar rate\r\nof expansion. This is illustrated by the following experiment:\r\n\r\n     A test-tube filled with cold water is closed by a stopper\r\n     containing a small glass tube, the water extending up into the\r\n     small tube. (See Fig. 127.) The test-tube is placed in a freezing\r\n     mixture of salt and ice contained in a tumbler. As the water cools,\r\n     the level of the water in the small tube at first _sinks_. But\r\n     before the water freezes it _rises_ again, showing that after the\r\n     water cools to a certain temperature that _expansion of the water\r\n     occurs with further cooling_.\r\n\r\nCareful tests show that the water on cooling contracts until it reaches\r\n4°C. On cooling below this temperature it expands. For this reason, when\r\nthe water of a lake or river freezes, the coldest water is at the\r\nsurface. On account of this the ice forms at the top instead of at the\r\nbottom. If water contracted as it cooled to the freezing temperature the\r\ncoldest water would be at the bottom. Freezing would begin at the bottom\r\ninstead of at the surface. Lakes and rivers would freeze solid. In the\r\nsummer only in shallow waters would all the ice melt. The result would\r\nbe that fish and other aquatic life would be killed. Climate would be so\r\nchanged that the earth might become uninhabitable. Since water is\r\ndensest at 4°C. all the water in a lake or river, when it is covered\r\nwith ice, is at 4°C. except that near the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--Apparatus used in testing the expansion of\r\nwater.]\r\n\r\n=149. The Expansion Of Solids.=--Most solids when heated expand less\r\nthan liquids and gases. Careful experiments show that expansion is:\r\n\r\n(a) Proportional to the change in temperature.\r\n\r\n(b) Different in different solids.\r\n\r\nHere are a few coefficients of linear (length) expansion.\r\n\r\n  Brass            0.000018 per degree C.\r\n  Glass            0.000009 per degree C.\r\n  Ice              0.000052 per degree C.\r\n  Iron             0.000012 per degree C.\r\n  Platinum         0.000009 per degree C.\r\n  Zinc             0.000027 per degree C.\r\n\r\n_The coefficient of linear expansion is the fraction of its length that\r\na body expands when heated one degree._\r\n\r\n_The coefficient of cubical expansion is the fraction of its volume that\r\na body expands when heated one degree._\r\n\r\nThe expansion of solids is used or allowed for in many cases:\r\n\r\na. Joints between the rails on a railroad allow for the expansion of the\r\nrails in summer.\r\n\r\nb. One end of a steel truss bridge is usually supported on rollers so\r\nthat it can expand and contract with changing temperatures. (See Fig.\r\n128.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Truss bridge showing roller support at one\r\nend.]\r\n\r\nc. Suspension bridges have expansion joints where the ends of the iron\r\ngirders can move in or out of an expansion joint thus making the bridge\r\nlonger or shorter according to the temperature.\r\n\r\nd. Iron tires are heated, slipped on to wagon wheels and then cooled,\r\nthe contraction on cooling setting them tightly in place.\r\n\r\ne. Metallic thermometers depend upon the movement due to the expansion\r\nof a coiled strip of metal which turns a pointer on the dial of the\r\ninstrument. (See Fig. 129.)\r\n\r\nf. The wires that are fused into glass in incandescent light bulbs must\r\nhave the same coefficient of expansion as the glass. Platinum has\r\ntherefore been used for this purpose. (See table above.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Metallic thermometer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Expansion of Liquids; peculiarities.

Define a \"cubic foot\" of illuminating gas.\r\n\r\n=150. Methods of Transmitting Heat.=--One of the most practical benefits\r\nof the study of heat is clearer understanding of the different methods\r\nby which heat is transferred from one place to another and an\r\nintelligent idea of the means employed to prevent the transfer of heat.\r\n\r\nIt should be definitely understood at the beginning that _cold signifies\r\nthe absence of heat_, just as darkness implies the absence of light, so\r\nwhen one speaks of cold getting into a house what is really meant is\r\neither the entrance of cold air by some opening or else the escape of\r\nthe heat.\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct methods by which heat energy is transferred\r\nfrom one place to another, depending upon the medium or substance that\r\ntransfers the heat.\r\n\r\na. A solid transmits heat by the method called _conduction_.\r\n\r\nb. A fluid, either a liquid or a gas, transmits heat mainly by the\r\nmethod called _convection_.\r\n\r\nc. Space transmits the energy of hot objects by the method called\r\n_radiation_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--Solids conduct heat.]\r\n\r\n=151. Conduction.=--To illustrate conduction, place in a gas flame the\r\nends of same metal wires supported as in Fig. 130. In a short time the\r\nother ends of the wires become hot enough to burn one's hand. This may\r\nbe explained as follows: The hot gas flame contains molecules in violent\r\nvibration and those striking the wire set its molecules rapidly\r\nvibrating. Since, in a solid, the molecules are held in the same\r\nrelative positions, when one end of a wire is heated the rapidly\r\nvibrating molecules at the hot end set their neighbors vibrating and\r\nthese the next in turn and so on until the whole wire is hot. It is a\r\nfortunate circumstance that different substances have different rates of\r\nconductivity for heat. To realize this, suppose that our clothing were\r\nas good a conductor as iron, clothing would then be very uncomfortable\r\nboth in hot and in cold weather. The best conductors for heat are\r\nmetals. It is interesting to note that, as a rule good conductors of\r\nheat are also good conductors of electricity, while poor conductors of\r\nheat are also poor electric conductors. Careful experiments in testing\r\nthe rate that heat will be conducted through different substances show\r\nthe following rates of conductivity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--Water is a poor conductor of heat.]\r\n\r\nThese figures are averages taken mainly from the Smithsonian Physical\r\nTables:\r\n\r\n  Silver           100\r\n  Copper            74\r\n  Aluminum          35\r\n  Brass             27\r\n  Zinc              26\r\n  Iron              15\r\n  Tin               14.7\r\n  German silver      8.4\r\n  Mercury            1.7\r\n  Granite            0.53\r\n  Limestone          0.52\r\n  Ice                0.5\r\n  Glass              0.2\r\n  Water              0.124\r\n  Pine, with grain   0.03\r\n  Pine, across grain 0.01\r\n  Felt               0.008\r\n  Air                0.005\r\n\r\nTo test the conductivity of _liquids_, take a test-tube nearly full of\r\ncold water, hold the lower end in the hand while the tube is inclined so\r\nthat the upper end is heated by a gas flame until the water boils. The\r\nlower end will be found to remain cold. (See Fig. 131.) Careful\r\nmeasurements of the conductivity of water show that heat is transmitted\r\nthrough it only {1/800} as rapidly as in silver, while air conducts but\r\n{1/25} as rapidly as water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--Wall construction of a refrigerator. 1,\r\nPorcelain enamel lining lock joint; 2, inside wood lining; 3, 3-ply red\r\nrope waterproof paper; 4, wool felt deafening paper; 5, flaxlinum\r\ninsulation; 6, dead air space; 7, flaxlinum insulation; 8, wool felt\r\ndeafening paper; 9, 3-ply red rope waterproof paper; 10, outside wood\r\ncase.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--Sectional view of a Thermos bottle.]\r\n\r\n=152. Non-conductors and Their Uses.=--Many solids, however, are poor\r\nconductors, as leather, fur, felt, and woolen cloth. These substances\r\nowe their non-conductivity mainly to the fact that they are porous. The\r\nair which fills the minute spaces of these substances is one of the\r\npoorest conductors known and hinders the transfer of heat through these\r\nsolids. For the same reason loosely packed snow is a protection to\r\nvegetation covered by it during a period of severe cold in winter. The\r\nefficiency of storm sash or double windows, and of the double and\r\ntriple walls of ice-houses and refrigerators (see Fig. 132) in\r\npreventing the conduction of heat is also largely due to the poor\r\nconductivity of the air confined in the spaces between the walls. To\r\nprevent the circulation of the air, sawdust, charcoal, and other porous\r\nmaterial is often loosely packed into the space between the walls of\r\nsuch structure.\r\n\r\nOther illustrations of effective non-conductors will occur to every one;\r\nsuch as _woolen_ clothing, _wooden_ handles for hot objects, and the\r\n_packing_ used in fireless cookers. A _Thermos_ bottle is effective as a\r\nnon-conductor of heat because the space between the double walls has the\r\nair exhausted from it (Figs. 133 and 134).\r\n\r\nOf several objects in a cold room, some feel much colder to the touch\r\nthan others, thus iron, marble, oil cloth, and earthenware will feel\r\ncolder than woolen cloth, carpet, feathers, or paper. The first four\r\nobjects feel cold because they are conductors, and conduct the heat away\r\nfrom the hand rapidly. The other substances named are non-conductors and\r\nhence remove heat from the hand less rapidly, and therefore do not feel\r\nso cold. In a similar way, if several hot objects are touched by the\r\nhand, the good conductors are the ones which will burn one most quickly\r\nby conducting heat rapidly to the hand. The non-conductors, however,\r\nwill rarely burn one. Why are the handles of hot utensils often made of\r\nnon-conducting materials such as wood, cloth, asbestos, etc.?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--Cross-section of the vacuum flask in a Thermos\r\nbottle.]\r\n\r\n=153. Radiation= is the method by which heat comes to us from the sun\r\nacross space containing no tangible matter. It is also the method by\r\nwhich heat gets to us when we stand near a fire. Everyone has noticed\r\nthat this heat is cut off by holding an object between the person and\r\nthe fire. This fact indicates that radiant heat travels in _straight_\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n_The radiation of heat_ is believed to be accomplished by means of waves\r\nin a medium called _ether_, which is invisible and yet pervades\r\neverything. Three of the most important characteristics of radiation are\r\n_first, heat is transferred by radiation with the speed of light_, or\r\n186,000 miles per second. This fact is shown by the cutting off of both\r\nthe sun's heat and light at the same instant during an eclipse of the\r\nsun. _Second, radiant heat[I] travels in straight lines_, while other\r\nmodes of transferring heat may follow irregular paths. The straight line\r\nmotion of radiant heat is shown by its being cut off where a screen is\r\nplaced between the source of heat and the object sheltered. _Third,\r\nradiant heat may pass through an object without heating it._ This is\r\nshown by the coldness of the upper layers of the atmosphere and also by\r\nthe fact that a pane of glass may not be heated appreciably by the heat\r\nand light from the sun which passes through it.\r\n\r\n  [I] Radiant heat is really _radiant energy_ and becomes heat when\r\n  it is absorbed by a body.\r\n\r\nWhen radiant energy falls upon any object it may be (a) _reflected_ at\r\nthe surface of the object, (b) _transmitted_ through the substance, (c),\r\nabsorbed. All three of these effects occur in different degrees with\r\ndifferent portions of the radiation. _Well-polished surfaces are good\r\nreflectors._ Rough and blackened surfaces are _good absorbers_.\r\nTransparent objects are those which transmit light well, but even they\r\nabsorb some of the energy.\r\n\r\n=154. The Radiometer.=--Radiant heat may be detected by means of the\r\nradiometer (Fig. 135). This consists of a glass bulb from which the air\r\nhas been nearly exhausted. Within it is a wheel with four vanes of mica\r\nor of aluminum mounted on a vertical axis. One side of each vane is\r\ncovered with lampblack, the other being highly polished. when exposed to\r\nradiant heat from any source the vanes revolve with the bright side in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe bulb is so nearly exhausted of air that a single molecule remaining\r\nmay travel from the walls of the bulb to the vanes without coming in\r\ncontact with another molecule.\r\n\r\nThe blackened sides absorb more heat than the highly polished sides. The\r\nair molecules striking these blackened sides receive more heat and so\r\nrebound with greater velocity than from the other side, thus exerting\r\ngreater pressure. The blackened sides therefore are driven backward. If\r\nthe air were not so rarified the air molecules would hit each other so\r\nfrequently as to equalize the pressure and there would be no motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--A radiometer.]\r\n\r\n_Sun's Radiation._--Accurate tests of the amount of the sun's radiation\r\nreceived upon a square centimeter of the earth's surface perpendicular\r\nto the sun's rays were made at Mt. Wilson in 1913. The average of 690\r\nobservations gave a value of 1.933 calories per minute. These results\r\nindicate that the sun's radiation per square centimeter is sufficient to\r\nwarm 1 g. of water 1.933°C. each minute. Although the _nature_ of\r\n_radiation_ is not discussed until Art. 408-411 in light, it should be\r\nsaid here that all bodies are radiating heat waves at all temperatures,\r\nthe heat waves from cool bodies being much longer than those from hot\r\nbodies. Glass allows the short luminous waves to pass through freely but\r\nthe longer heat waves from objects at the room temperature pass through\r\nwith difficulty. This is the reason why glass is used in the covering of\r\ngreenhouses and hot beds. Water also absorbs many of the longer heat\r\nwaves. It is therefore used in stereopticons to prevent delicate lantern\r\nslides from being injured by overheating.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Conduction in solids, liquids, gases.\r\n\r\n2.

Convection.=--While fluids are poor conductors, they may transmit\r\nheat more effectively than solids by the mode called _convection_. To\r\nillustrate: if heat is applied at the _top_ of a test-tube of water,\r\nthe hot water being lighter is found at the top, while at the bottom the\r\nwater remains cold. On the other hand, if heat is applied at the\r\n_bottom_ of the vessel, as soon as the water at the bottom is warmed\r\n(above 4°C.) it expands, becomes lighter and is pushed up to the top by\r\nthe colder, denser water about it. This circulation of water continues\r\nas long as heat is applied below, until all of the water is brought to\r\nthe boiling temperature. (See Fig. 136.)\r\n\r\nWhen a liquid or a gas is heated in the manner just described, the heat\r\nis said to be transferred by _convection_. Thus the air in the lower\r\npart of a room may receive heat by conduction from a stove or radiator.\r\nAs it expands on being warmed, it is pushed up by the colder denser air\r\nabout it, which takes its place, thus creating a circulation of the air\r\nin the room. (See Fig. 137.) The heated currents of air give up their\r\nheat to the objects in the room as the circulation continues. These air\r\ncurrents may be observed readily by using the smoke from burning \"touch\r\npaper\" (unglazed paper that has been dipped into a solution of potassium\r\nnitrate [\"saltpeter\"] and dried).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Convection in a liquid.]\r\n\r\n=156. Draft of a Chimney.=--When a fire is started in a stove or a\r\nfurnace the air above the fire becomes heated, expands, and therefore is\r\nless dense than it was before. This warm air and the heated gases which\r\nare the products of the combustion of the fuel weigh less than an equal\r\nvolume of the colder air outside. Therefore they are pushed upward by a\r\nforce equal to the difference between their weight and the weight of an\r\nequal volume of the colder air.\r\n\r\nThe chimney soon becomes filled with these heated gases. (See Fig. 138.)\r\nThese are pushed upward by the pressure of the colder, denser air,\r\nbecause this colder air is pulled downward more strongly by the force of\r\ngravity than are the heated gases in the chimney.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, the taller the chimney, the greater the draft,\r\nbecause there is a greater difference between the weight of the gases\r\ninside and the weight of an equal volume of outside air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--Convection currents in a room.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--Fire place showing draft of a chimney.]\r\n\r\n=157. Convection Currents in Nature.=--Winds are produced by differences\r\nin the _pressure_ or _density_ of the air, the movement being from\r\nplaces of high toward places of low pressure. One of the causes of a\r\ndifference in density of the air is a difference in temperature. This\r\nis illustrated by what are called the _land_ and _sea breezes_ along the\r\nsea shore or large lakes. During the day, the temperature of the land\r\nbecomes higher than that of the sea. The air over the land expands and\r\nbeing lighter is moved back and upward by the colder, denser air from\r\nthe sea or lake. This constitutes the _sea breezes_ (Fig. 139). At night\r\nthe land becomes cooler much sooner than the sea and the current is\r\nreversed causing the _land breeze_. (See Fig. 140.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--Sea breeze.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--Land breeze.]\r\n\r\nThe _trade winds_ are convection currents moving toward the hot\r\nequatorial belt from both the north and the south. In the hot belt the\r\nair rises and the upper air flows back to the north and the south. This\r\nregion of ascending currents of air is a region of heavy rainfall, since\r\nthe saturated air rises to cool altitudes where its moisture is\r\ncondensed. The _ocean currents_ are also convection currents. Their\r\nmotion is due to prevailing winds, differences in density due to\r\nevaporation and freezing, and to the rotation of the earth, as well as\r\nto changes in temperature.\r\n\r\n=158. The heating and ventilation of buildings= and the problems\r\nconnected therewith are matters of serious concern to all who live in\r\nwinter in the temperate zone. Not only should the air in living rooms be\r\ncomfortably heated, but it should be continually changed especially in\r\nthe crowded rooms of public buildings, as those of schools, churches,\r\nand assembly halls, so that each person may be supplied with 30 or more\r\ncubic feet of fresh air per minute. In the colonial days, the _open fire\r\nplace_ afforded the ordinary means for heating rooms. This heated the\r\nroom mainly by _radiation_. It was wasteful as most of the heat passed\r\nup the chimney. This mode of heating secured ample _ventilation_. Fire\r\nplaces are sometimes built in modern homes as an aid to ventilation.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin seeing the waste of heat in the open fire places\r\ndevised an iron box to contain the fire. This was placed in the room and\r\nprovided heat by conduction, convection, and radiation. It was called\r\n_Franklin's stove_ and in many forms is still commonly used. It saves a\r\nlarge part of the heat produced by burning the fuel and some ventilation\r\nis provided by its draft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Heating and ventilating by means of a hot-air\r\nfurnace.]\r\n\r\n=159. Heating by Hot Air.=--The presence of stoves in living rooms of\r\nhomes is accompanied by the annoyance of scattered fuel, dust, ashes,\r\nsmoke, etc. One attempt to remove this inconvenience led to placing a\r\nlarge stove or fire box in the basement or cellar, surrounding this with\r\na jacket to provide a space for heating air which is then conducted by\r\npipes to the rooms above. This device is called the hot-air furnace.\r\n(See Fig. 141.) The heated air rises because it is pushed up by colder,\r\ndenser air which enters through the cold-air pipes. The _hot-air\r\nfurnace_ provides a good circulation of warm air and also ventilation,\r\nprovided some cold air is admitted to the furnace from the outside. One\r\nobjection to its use is that it may not heat a building evenly, one part\r\nbeing very hot while another may be cool. To provide even and sufficient\r\nheat throughout a large building, use is made of _hot water_ or _steam\r\nheating_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--A hot-water system of heating.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--One-pipe system of steam heating.]\r\n\r\n=160. Hot-water Heating.=--In hot-water heating a furnace arranged for\r\nheating water is placed in the basement. (See Fig. 142.) Attached to the\r\ntop of the heater are pipes leading to the radiators in the various\r\nrooms; other pipes connect the radiators to the bottom of the boiler.\r\nThe heater, pipes, and radiators are all filled with water before the\r\nfire is started. When the water is warmed, it expands and is pushed up\r\nthrough the pipes by the colder water in the return pipe. The\r\ncirculation continuing brings hot water to the radiator while the cooled\r\nwater returns to the heater, the hot radiators heating the several\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n=161. Steam Heating.=--In _steam heating_ a steam boiler is connected to\r\nradiators by pipes. (See Fig. 143.) The steam drives the air out of the\r\npipes and radiators and serves as an efficient source of heat. Heating\r\nby steam is _quicker_ than heating with hot water. It is therefore\r\npreferred where quick, efficient heating is required. Hot water is less\r\nintense and more economical in mild weather and is often used in private\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--Heating by an indirect radiator with side-wall\r\nregister.]\r\n\r\n=162. Direct and Indirect Heating.=--In heating by _direct radiation_\r\n(Figs. 142, 143), the steam or hot-water radiators are placed in the\r\nrooms to be heated. With direct radiation, ventilation must be provided\r\nby special means, such as opening windows, doors, and ventilators.\r\nSometimes radiators are placed in a box or room in the basement. Air\r\nfrom out of doors is then driven by a fan over and about the hot\r\nradiators. The air thus heated is conducted by pipes to the several\r\nrooms. This arrangement is called _indirect heating_. (See Fig. 144.)\r\nThe latter method, it may be observed, provides both heat and\r\nventilation, and hence is often used in schools, churches, court houses,\r\nand stores. Since heated air, especially in cold weather, has a low\r\n_relative humidity_ some means of moistening the air of living rooms\r\nshould be provided. Air when too dry is injurious to the health and also\r\nto furniture and wood work. The excessive drying of wood and glue in a\r\npiece of furniture often causes it to fall apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--An automatic air valve.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--An automatic vacuum valve.]\r\n\r\n=163. Vacuum Steam Heating.=--In steam heating, air valves (Fig. 145)\r\nare placed on the radiators to allow the air they contain to escape when\r\nthe steam is turned on. When all the air is driven out the valve closes.\r\nAutomatic vacuum valves (Fig. 146) are sometimes used. When the fire is\r\nlow and there is no steam pressure in the radiators the pressure of the\r\nair closes the valve, making a partial vacuum inside. The boiling point\r\nof water falls as the pressure upon it is reduced. As water will not\r\nboil under ordinary atmospheric pressure until its temperature is 100°C.\r\n(212°F.), it follows that by the use of vacuum systems, often called\r\nvapor systems, of steam heating, water will be giving off hot vapor even\r\nafter the fire has been banked for hours. This results in a considerable\r\nsaving of fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--Plenum hot-blast system with temperature\r\nregulation.]\r\n\r\n=164. The Plenum System of Heating.=--In the plenum system of heating\r\n(see Fig. 147) fresh air is drawn through a window from outdoors and\r\ngoes first through tempering coils where the temperature is raised to\r\nabout 70°. The fan then forces some of the air through heating coils,\r\nwhere it is reheated and raised to a much higher temperature, depending\r\nupon the weather conditions. Both the hot and tempered air are kept\r\nunder pressure by the fan in the plenum room and are forced from this\r\nroom through galvanized iron ducts to the various rooms to be heated.\r\nThe foul air is forced out of the room through vent ducts which lead to\r\nthe attic where it escapes through ventilators in the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.--A thermostat. (Johnson System.)]\r\n\r\nA thermostat is placed in the tempered-air part of the plenum room to\r\nmaintain the proper temperature of the tempered air. This thermostat\r\noperates the by-pass damper under the tempering coils, and sometimes the\r\nvalves on the coils. The mixing dampers at the base of the\r\ngalvanized-iron ducts are controlled by their respective room\r\nthermostats. Attic-vent, fresh-air, and return-air dampers are under\r\npneumatic switch control. A humidifier can be provided readily for this\r\nsystem. This system of heating is designed particularly for school\r\nhouses where adequate ventilation is a necessity.\r\n\r\n=165. The Thermostat.=--One of the many examples of the expansion of\r\nmetals is shown in one form of the thermostat (Fig. 148) in which two\r\npieces of different metals and of unequal rates of expansion, as brass\r\nand iron, are securely fastened together.\r\n\r\nThe thermostatic strip _T_ moving inward and outward, as affected by the\r\nroom temperature, varies the amount of air which can escape through the\r\nsmall port _C_. When the port _C_ is completely closed (Fig. 148_a_) the\r\nfull air pressure collects on the diaphragm _B_ which forces down the\r\nmain valve, letting the compressed air from the main pass through the\r\nchamber _D_ into chamber _E_ as the valve is forced off its seat. The\r\nair from chamber _E_ then passes into the branch to operate the damper.\r\n\r\nWhen port _C_ is fully open (Fig. 148_b_) the air pressure on diaphragm\r\n_B_ is relieved, the back pressure in _E_ lifts up the diaphragm and the\r\nair from the branch escapes out through the hollow stem of the main\r\nvalve, operating the damper in the opposite direction from that when _C_\r\nis closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Explain its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) THE MOISTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE, HYGROMETRY\r\n\r\n=166. Water Vapor in the Air.=--The amount of water vapor present in the\r\nair has a marked effect upon the weather and the climate of a locality.\r\nThe study of the moisture conditions of the atmosphere, or hygrometry,\r\nis therefore a matter of general interest and importance. The water\r\nvapor in the atmosphere is entirely due to evaporation from bodies of\r\nwater, or snow, or ice. In the discussion of evaporation, it is\r\ndescribed as due to the gradual escape of molecules into the air from\r\nthe surface of a liquid. This description fits exactly the conditions\r\nfound by all careful observers. Since the air molecules are continually\r\nstriking the surface of the liquid, many of them penetrate it and become\r\nabsorbed. In the same manner many vapor molecules reenter the liquid,\r\nand if enough vapor molecules are present in the air so that as many\r\nvapor molecules reenter the liquid each second as leave it, the space\r\nabove the liquid is said to be _saturated_ as previously described. (See\r\nArt. 18.)\r\n\r\n=167. Conditions for Saturation.=--If a liquid is evaporating into a\r\nvacuum, the molecules on leaving find no opposition until they reach the\r\nlimits of the vessel containing the vacuum. Evaporation under these\r\nconditions goes on with great rapidity and the space becomes saturated\r\nalmost instantly. If, however, air be present at ordinary pressure, many\r\nof the ordinary water vapor molecules on leaving are struck and returned\r\nto the water by the air molecules directly above. Those escaping\r\ngradually work their way upward through the air. This explains why it is\r\nthat our atmosphere is not often saturated even near large bodies of\r\nwater, the retarding effect of the air upon the evaporation preventing\r\nmore than the layers of air near the water surface becoming saturated.\r\n\r\nJust as the amount of salt that can be held in solution in a liquid is\r\nlessened by cooling the solution (Art. 26), so the amount of water vapor\r\nthat can be held in the air is lessened by lowering its temperature. If\r\nair not moist enough to be saturated with water vapor is cooled, it\r\nwill, as the cooling continues, finally reach a temperature at which it\r\nwill be saturated or will contain all the water vapor it can hold at\r\nthis temperature. If the air be still further cooled some of the water\r\nvapor will condense and may form fog, dew, rain, snow, etc., the form it\r\ntakes depending upon where and how the cooling takes place.\r\n\r\n=168. The Formation of Dew.=--If the cooling of the atmosphere is at the\r\nsurface of some cold object which lowers the temperature of the air\r\nbelow its saturation point, some of its moisture condenses and collects\r\nupon the cold surface as _dew_. This may be noticed upon the surface of\r\na pitcher of ice-water in summer. At night, the temperature of grass and\r\nother objects near or on the ground may fall much faster than that of\r\nthe atmosphere owing to the radiation of heat from these objects. If the\r\ntemperature falls below the saturation point, dew will be formed. This\r\nnatural radiation is hindered when it is cloudy, therefore little dew\r\nforms on cloudy nights. Clear nights help radiation, therefore we have\r\nthe most dew on nights when the sky is clear. If the temperature is\r\nbelow freezing, _frost_ forms instead of dew.\r\n\r\n=169. Formation of Fog.=--If the cooling at night is great enough to\r\ncool the body of air near the earth below the saturation temperature,\r\nthen not only may dew be formed, but some moisture is condensed in the\r\nair itself, usually upon fine dust particles suspended in it. This\r\nconstitutes a _fog_. If the cooling of the body of air takes place above\r\nthe earth's surface as when a warm moist current of air enters a colder\r\nregion, _e.g._, moves over the top of a cold mountain, or into the upper\r\nair, then as this air is cooled below its saturation point, condensation\r\nupon fine suspended dust particles takes place, and a _cloud_ is formed.\r\nIf much moisture is present in the cloud, the drops of water grow in\r\nsize until they begin to fall and _rain_ results; or if it is cold\r\nenough, instead of rain, snowflakes will be formed and fall. Sometimes\r\nwhirling winds in severe thunderstorms carry the raindrops into colder\r\nand then warmer regions, alternately freezing and moistening the drops\r\nor bits of ice. It is in this way that _hail_ is said to be formed.\r\n\r\n=170. The Dew Point.=--The temperature to which air must be cooled to\r\nsaturate it or the temperature at which condensation begins is called\r\nthe _dew point_. This is often determined in the laboratory by partly\r\nfilling a polished metal vessel with water and cooling the water by\r\nadding ice until a thin film of moisture is formed upon the outer\r\nsurface. The temperature of the surface when the moisture first forms is\r\nthe dew point.\r\n\r\n=171. The Humidity of the Atmosphere.=--After the dew point has been\r\nobtained, one may compute the _relative humidity_ or _degree of\r\nsaturation of the atmosphere_, from the table given below. This is\r\ndefined as the _ratio of the amount of water vapor present in the air to\r\nthe amount that would be present if the air were saturated at the same\r\ntemperature_.\r\n\r\n     For example, if the dew point is 5°C. and the temperature of the\r\n     air is 22°C., we find the densities of the water vapor at the two\r\n     temperatures, and find their ratio: 6.8/19.3 = 35 per cent. nearly.\r\n     Determinations of humidity may give indication of rain or frost and\r\n     are regularly made at weather bureau stations. They are also made\r\n     in buildings such as greenhouses, hospitals, and schoolhouses to\r\n     see if the air is moist enough. For the most healthful conditions\r\n     the relative humidity should be from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF WATER (_w_) IN GRAMS CONTAINED IN 1 CUBIC METER OF SATURATED\r\nAIR AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES (_t_°)C.\r\n\r\n  --------+------\r\n   _t_°C. | _w_\r\n  --------+------\r\n    -10   |  2.1\r\n    - 9   |  2.4\r\n    - 8   |  2.7\r\n    - 7   |  3.0\r\n    - 6   |  3.2\r\n    - 5   |  3.5\r\n    - 4   |  3.8\r\n    - 3   |  4.1\r\n    - 2   |  4.4\r\n    - 1   |  4.6\r\n      0   |  4.9\r\n      1   |  5.2\r\n      2   |  5.6\r\n      3   |  6.0\r\n      4   |  6.4\r\n      5   |  6.8\r\n      6   |  7.3\r\n      7   |  7.7\r\n      8   |  8.1\r\n      9   |  8.8\r\n     10   |  9.4\r\n     11   | 10.0\r\n     12   | 10.6\r\n     13   | 11.3\r\n     14   | 12.0\r\n     15   | 12.8\r\n     16   | 13.6\r\n     17   | 14.5\r\n     18   | 15.1\r\n     19   | 16.2\r\n     20   | 17.2\r\n     21   | 18.2\r\n     22   | 19.3\r\n     23   | 20.4\r\n     24   | 21.5\r\n     25   | 22.9\r\n     26   | 24.2\r\n     27   | 25.6\r\n     28   | 27.0\r\n     29   | 28.6\r\n     30   | 30.1\r\n  --------+------\r\n\r\n=172. Wet and Dry Bulb Hygrometer.=--A device for indicating the\r\nrelative humidity of the air is called an _hygrometer_. There are\r\nvarious forms. The _wet_ and _dry bulb hygrometer_ is shown in Fig. 149.\r\nThis device consists of two thermometers, one with its bulb dry and\r\nexposed to the air, the other bulb being kept continually moist by a\r\nwick dipping into a vessel of water. An application of the principle of\r\ncooling by evaporation is made in this instrument. Unless the air is\r\nsaturated so that evaporation is prevented, the wet-bulb thermometer\r\nshows a lower temperature, the difference depending upon the amount of\r\nmoisture in the air, or upon the relative humidity. Most determinations\r\nof relative humidity are made with this kind of instrument. It is\r\nnecessary in order to make an accurate determination, to fan or set the\r\nair in motion about the thermometers for some time before reading them.\r\nThe relative humidity is then found by using tables giving the relative\r\nhumidity that corresponds to any reading of the thermometers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--Wet and dry bulb hygrometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.--A dial hygrometer.]\r\n\r\n     A form of hygrometer in common use is shown in Fig. 150. In this\r\n     device, a thin strip of hygroscopic material (as a piece of goose\r\n     quill) is formed into a spiral coil. One end of this is fastened to\r\n     a post. The other end carried a hand or pointer. The latter moves\r\n     over a printed scale and indicates directly the relative humidity.\r\n     Its indications should be tested by comparing its readings with the\r\n     results of dew-point determinations. The position of the pointer\r\n     may be adjusted by turning the post.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Water vapor in the air. Cause and effect.\r\n\r\n2.

Effects of Evaporation.=--In Art. 19 the cooling effect of\r\nevaporation is mentioned and some explanation is made of the cooling\r\neffect observed. Since evaporation is employed in so many ways, and\r\nsince its action is simply explained by the study we have made of\r\nmolecular motions and molecular forces, it may be well to consider this\r\nsubject further.\r\n\r\n     Take three shallow dishes, and place in one a little water, in\r\n     another some alcohol, and some ether in the third, the liquids\r\n     being taken from bottles that have stood several hours in the room\r\n     so that all are at the same temperature. After a short time take\r\n     the temperature of the three liquids. Each will be at a lower\r\n     temperature than at first, but of the three the ether will be found\r\n     to be the coolest, alcohol next, and the water nearest its first\r\n     temperature. It will be noticed also that the ether has evaporated\r\n     most in the same time. Similar effects may be observed by placing a\r\n     few drops of each of these three liquids upon the back of one's\r\n     hand, or by placing a few drops in turn upon the bulb of a simple\r\n     air thermometer.\r\n\r\n=174. Cooling Effect of Evaporation.=--The molecules that leave an\r\nevaporating liquid are naturally the swiftest moving ones, that is, the\r\nones having the highest temperature, so their escape leaves the liquids\r\ncooler than before, and the one whose molecules leave fastest is\r\nnaturally the one that becomes coldest, that is, the ether, in the\r\nexperiment of Art. 173. If no air pressure were exerted upon the surface\r\nof the liquid, the escape of the molecules would be much increased and\r\nthe temperature of the liquid would be lowered rapidly.\r\n\r\n     To test this, fill a thin watch glass with ether and place it over\r\n     a thin slip of glass with a drop of cold water between the two. Now\r\n     place this apparatus under the receiver of an air pump and exhaust\r\n     the air. The rapid evaporation of the ether so lowers its\r\n     temperature, that often the drop of water is frozen. The lowest\r\n     temperatures are obtained by evaporating liquids at reduced\r\n     pressure.\r\n\r\nOnnes by evaporating liquid helium at a pressure of about 1.2 mm.\r\nreached the lowest temperature yet attained, -456°F., or -271.3°C.\r\n\r\n     If four thermometers are taken, the bulbs of three being wetted\r\n     respectively with ether, alcohol, and water the fourth being dry,\r\n     on vigorously fanning these, the moistened thermometers show that\r\n     they have been cooled while the dry one is unaffected.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that fanning a dry body at the temperature of the air\r\ndoes not change its temperature. Fanning does increase evaporation by\r\nremoving the air containing the evaporated molecules near the surface of\r\nthe liquid so that unsaturated air is continually over the liquid. If a\r\npint of water is placed in a bottle and another pint in a wide pan the\r\nlatter will become dry much sooner because of the greater surface over\r\nwhich evaporation can take place. Application of this is made at salt\r\nworks where the brine is spread out in shallow pans.\r\n\r\n=175. Rate of Evaporation.=--The rate of evaporation is affected by\r\nseveral factors. These have been illustrated in the preceding\r\nparagraphs. To briefly summarize:\r\n\r\nThe rate of evaporation of a liquid is affected by--\r\n\r\n(a) The nature of the liquid.\r\n\r\n(b) The temperature of the liquid.\r\n\r\n(c) The pressure upon its evaporating surface.\r\n\r\n(d) The degree of saturation of the space into which the liquid is\r\nevaporating.\r\n\r\n(e) The rate of circulation of air over its surface.\r\n\r\n(f) The extent of surface exposed to evaporation.\r\n\r\n=176. Molecular Motion in Solids.=--Evidence of molecular motion in\r\nliquids is given by expansion on heating, evaporation, and diffusion. Do\r\nany of these lines of evidence apply to solids? It is a fact of common\r\nexperience that solids do become larger on heating. Spaces are left\r\nbetween the ends of rails on railroads so that when they expand in\r\nsummer they will not distort the track. Iron tires are placed on wheels\r\nby heating them until they slip on easily. Then on cooling, the iron\r\nshrinks and presses the wheel tightly. Many common demonstrations of\r\nexpansion are found in lecture rooms. The fact of the evaporation of a\r\nsolid is often detected by noticing the odor of a substance. The odor of\r\nmoth balls is one example. Camphor also evaporates. Heated tin has a\r\ncharacteristic odor noted by many. Ice and snow disappear in winter even\r\nthough the temperature is below freezing. Wet clothes, \"freeze dry,\"\r\nthat is, dry after freezing, by evaporation. A few crystals of iodine\r\nplaced in a test-tube and gently heated form a vapor easily seen, even\r\nthough none of the iodine melts. Where the vapor strikes the side of the\r\ntube, it condenses back to dark gray crystals of iodine. This change\r\nfrom solid directly to gas and back again without becoming liquid is\r\ncalled _sublimation_. A number of solids are purified by this process.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Since three-quarters of the earth's surface is covered with water,\r\nwhy is not the air constantly saturated?\r\n\r\n5.

What is the cause of \"Cloud Capped\" mountains?\r\n\r\n7. Why does the exhaust steam from an engine appear to have so much\r\ngreater volume on a cold day in winter than on a warm one in summer?\r\n\r\n8. What causes an unfrozen pond or lake to \"steam\" on a very cold day in\r\nwinter, or on a very cool morning in summer?\r\n\r\n9. As the air on a mountain top settles down the sides to places of\r\ngreater pressure, how will its temperature be affected? its relative\r\nhumidity? Explain.\r\n\r\n10. On our Pacific coast, moist winds blow from the west over the\r\nmountains. Where will it rain? Where be dry? Explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHEAT AND WORK\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) HEAT MEASUREMENT AND SPECIFIC HEAT\r\n\r\n=177. Specific Heat.=--In the study of density and specific gravity it\r\nis made clear that different substances differ widely in the amount of\r\nmatter contained in equal volumes, _e.g._, lead is much denser than\r\nwater. The study of the relative densities of substance is usually\r\nconsidered under the subject of _specific gravity_.\r\n\r\n_Specific heat_ as distinguished from specific gravity is concerned with\r\nthe _capacity_ for heat possessed by different substances. The\r\ndefinition for specific heat is: _The ratio of the amount of heat\r\nrequired to change the temperature of a given mass of a substance 1 C.\r\ndegree to the amount of heat required to change the temperature of the\r\nsame mass of water 1 C. degree._ By definition, it requires 1 calorie to\r\nraise the temperature of the gram of water 1°C. The _specific heat_\r\ntherefore of water is taken as one. The specific heat of most substances\r\nexcept hydrogen, is _less_ than that of water, and as a rule, the denser\r\nthe body the less its specific heat, as may be observed in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n  ---------+----------+----------\r\n           | Specific | Specific\r\n           | gravity  |   heat\r\n  ---------+----------+----------\r\n  Gold     | 19.3     |  0.032\r\n  Mercury  | 13.6     |  0.033\r\n  Copper   |  8.9     |  0.093\r\n  Brass    |  8.4-8.9 |  0.094\r\n  Nickel   |  8.57    |  0.11\r\n  Iron     |  7.5+    |  0.1125\r\n  Aluminum |  2.67    |  0.218\r\n  Glass    |  2.5-3.6 |  0.19\r\n  Ice      |  0.918   |  0.504\r\n  Air      |  0.00129 |  0.237\r\n  Steam    |  0.00061 |  0.480\r\n  Hydrogen |  0.00009 |  3.409\r\n  ---------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n=178. Method of Determining Specific Heat.=--The specific heat of a body\r\nis usually determined by what is called the _method of mixtures_.\r\n\r\n     For example, a definite weight of a substance, say a 200-g. iron\r\n     ball, is placed in boiling water until it has the temperature of\r\n     the hot water, 100°C. Suppose that 300 g. of water at 18°C. be\r\n     placed in a calorimeter, and that the hot iron ball on being placed\r\n     in the water raises its temperature to 23.5°C. The heat received by\r\n     the water equals 5.5 × 300 = 1650 calories. This must have come\r\n     from the heated iron ball. 200 g. of iron then in cooling 76.5°C.\r\n     (100°-23.5°) gave out 1650 calories. Then 1 g. of iron in cooling\r\n     76.5°C. Would give out 8.25 calories or 1 g. of iron cooling 1°C.\r\n     would yield about 0.11 calorie. The specific heat of the iron is\r\n     then 0.11. For accurate determination the heat received by the\r\n     calorimeter must be considered.\r\n\r\n=179. Heat Capacity of Water.=--The large capacity for heat shown by\r\nwater is useful in regulating the temperature of the air near lakes and\r\nthe ocean. In hot weather the water rises slowly in temperature\r\nabsorbing heat from the warm winds blowing over it. In winter the large\r\namount of heat stored in the water is slowly given out to the air above.\r\nThus the climate near the ocean is made more moderate both in winter and\r\nsummer by the large capacity of water for heat. This large heat capacity\r\nof water may seem to be a disadvantage when one is warming it for\r\ndomestic purposes since it requires so much heat to warm water to\r\nboiling. However, it is this capacity that makes hot-water bottles and\r\nhot-water heating effective.\r\n\r\n     If one takes a pound of ice at 0°C. in one dish and a pound of\r\n     water at 0°C. in another, and warms the dish of ice by a Bunsen\r\n     flame until the ice is just melted, and then warms the water in the\r\n     other dish for the same time, the water will be found to be _hot_\r\n     and at a temperature 80°C., or 176°F.\r\n\r\n=180. The Heat of Fusion of Ice.=--This experiment indicates the large\r\namount of heat required to change the ice to water without changing its\r\ntemperature. As indicated by the experiment, it requires 80 calories to\r\nmelt 1 g. of ice without changing its temperature or, in other words, if\r\none placed 1 g. of ice at 0°C. in 1 g. of water at 80°C., the ice would\r\nbe melted and the water would be cooled to 0°C.\r\n\r\n=181. Heat Given out by Freezing water.=--Just as 80 calories of heat\r\nare required to melt 1 g. of ice, so in freezing 1 g. of water, 80\r\ncalories of heat are given out.\r\n\r\n     The fact that heat is set free or given out when a liquid\r\n     solidifies may be strikingly shown by making a strong solution of\r\n     sodium acetate. On allowing this to cool quietly it will come to\r\n     the room temperature and remain liquid. If now a small crystal of\r\n     sodium acetate is dropped into the liquid the latter quickly\r\n     becomes a solid mass of crystals, at the same time rising markedly\r\n     in temperature. The amount of heat now liberated must enter the\r\n     sodium acetate when the mass of crystals is melted again.\r\n\r\nThe large amount of heat that must be liberated before water freezes\r\naccounts for the slowness of the formation of ice. It is also the reason\r\nwhy the temperature never falls so low in the vicinity of large lakes as\r\nit does far inland, the heat given out by the freezing water warming the\r\nsurrounding air.\r\n\r\nThe heat that disappears on melting and reappears on solidifying is\r\ncalled the _heat of fusion_. It is sometimes called _latent heat_ since\r\nthe heat seems to become hidden or latent. It is now believed that the\r\nheat energy that disappears when a body melts has been transformed into\r\nthe _potential energy_ of partially separated molecules. The heat of\r\nfusion therefore represents the work done in changing a solid to a\r\nliquid without a change of temperature.\r\n\r\n=182. Melting of Crystalline and Amorphous Substances.=--If a piece of\r\nice is placed in boiling hot water and then removed, the temperature of\r\nthe unmelted ice is still 0°C. There is no known means of warming ice\r\nunder atmospheric pressure above its melting point and maintaining its\r\nsolid state. Ice being composed of ice crystals is called a crystalline\r\nbody. All crystalline substances have fixed melting points. For example,\r\nice always melts at 0°C. The melting points of some common crystalline\r\nsubstances are given below:\r\n\r\n_Melting Points of Some Crystalline Substances_\r\n\r\n   1. Aluminum                          658 C.\r\n   2. Cast iron                        1200 C.\r\n   3. Copper                           1083 C.\r\n   4. Ice                                 0 C.\r\n   5. Lead                              327 C.\r\n   6. Mercury                           -39 C.\r\n   7. Phenol (carbolic acid)             43 C.\r\n   8. Platinum                         1755 C.\r\n   9. Salt (sodium chloride)            795 C.\r\n  10. Saltpeter (potassium nitrate)     340 C.\r\n  11. Silver                            961 C.\r\n  12. Sodium hyposulphite (hypo)         47 C.\r\n  13. Zinc                              419 C.\r\n\r\n_Non-crystalline or amorphous substances_ such as glass, tar, glue,\r\netc., do not have well defined melting points as do crystalline bodies.\r\nWhen heated they gradually soften and become fluid. For this reason\r\nglass can be pressed and molded.\r\n\r\n=183. Change of Volume During Solidification.=--The fact that ice floats\r\nand that it breaks bottles and pipes in which it freezes shows that\r\nwater expands on freezing. How a substance may occupy more space when\r\nsolid than when liquid may be understood when we learn that ice consists\r\nof masses of star-shaped crystals. (See Fig. 151.) The formation of\r\nthese crystals must leave unoccupied spaces between them in the ice.\r\nWhen liquefied, however, no spaces are left and the substance occupies\r\nless volume. Most substances contract upon solidifying. Antimony and\r\nbismuth, however, expand on solidifying while iron changes little in\r\nvolume. Only those bodies that expand, or else show little change of\r\nvolume on solidifying, can make sharp castings, for if they contract\r\nthey will not completely fill the mold. For this reason gold and silver\r\ncoins must be stamped and not cast. Type metal, an alloy of antimony and\r\nlead, expands on solidifying to form the sharp outlines of good type.\r\nSeveral important effects of the expansion of water when freezing should\r\nbe noted. (a) Ice floats, (b) if it sank as soon as formed, lakes and\r\nrivers would freeze solid, (c) freezing water is one of the active\r\nagents in the disintegration of rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--Ice crystals.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--Melting ice by pressure.]\r\n\r\nSince water expands on freezing, pressure would on compressing ice at\r\n0°C., tend to turn it into water. Pressure does lower the melting point\r\nof ice, so that a little ice may melt when it is subjected to pressure.\r\nOn removing the pressure the water freezes. This may be shown by placing\r\na loop of fine piano wire (see Fig. 152) over a piece of ice supported\r\nso that a weight may be hung upon the wire. The wire will be found to\r\ngradually cut through the ice, the melted ice refreezing above the wire.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Specific heat.\r\n\r\n2. Heat of fusion of ice.\r\n\r\n3.

Heat of Vaporization.=--In our study of evaporation in Art. 174 we\r\nconsidered the more rapidly moving or vibrating molecules in the liquid\r\nescaping to the air above and the slower moving molecules being left\r\nbehind in the liquid; this means that a loss of heat will result upon\r\nevaporation, the liquid remaining becoming cooler as the process\r\ncontinues. Now just as a ball thrown up in the air loses its kinetic\r\nenergy as it rises, and acquires energy of position or potential energy,\r\nso molecules escaping from a liquid lose a certain amount of kinetic\r\nenergy or heat and acquire a corresponding amount of _energy of\r\nposition_ or potential energy. _Conversely_, as the ball returns to the\r\nground its potential energy is changed to kinetic energy. Similarly when\r\nvapor molecules return to the liquid condition they lose their energy of\r\nposition and acquire kinetic energy. In other words, when a liquid\r\nevaporates a certain amount of heat disappears, or becomes _latent_ and\r\nwhen the vapor condenses the heat reappears, or becomes _sensible_ heat.\r\n_The amount of heat that disappears when 1 g. of a substance is\r\nvaporized is called the heat of vaporization._ In the case of water at\r\nits boiling point, 536 calories of heat disappear when 1 g. of water\r\nturns to vapor, and this same amount of heat reappears when the vapor\r\ncondenses.\r\n\r\nThe change of volume of water on turning to steam is shown in Fig. 153.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--Effect of pressure on the boiling point.]\r\n\r\n=185. The Boiling Point.=--The boiling temperature depends upon the\r\npressure. The boiling point may be defined as _the temperature at which\r\nbubbles of vapor are formed within the liquid_. These bubbles increase\r\nthe surface at which evaporation can take place in the liquid, and the\r\nprincipal reason why rapid application of heat to a liquid does not\r\nraise its temperature above the boiling point is that as more heat is\r\napplied more bubbles form so that the increase of evaporating surface\r\nsupplies a correspondingly greater surface for cooling. The variation of\r\nthe boiling temperature with changing pressure may be shown by partly\r\nfilling a strong 7/8-in. test-tube with water. Close the neck with a\r\none-hole rubber stopper through which passes a glass tube to which is\r\nattached a soft rubber tube. (See Fig. 154.) Support the tube by a\r\nholder, heat the water and boil until all the air is driven from the\r\ntube, then close the soft rubber tube with a pinch cock and hold the\r\ntube in an inverted position. On cooling the end of the tube above the\r\nwater with cold water or snow, the vapor within is condensed and the\r\npressure upon the water is reduced. Vigorous boiling begins at once. By\r\ncondensing the vapor repeatedly the water may be made to boil at the\r\nroom temperature. At the top of Mt. Blanc water boils at 84°C. While in\r\nsteam boilers at 225 lbs. pressure to the square inch the boiling point\r\nis nearly 200°C.\r\n\r\n=186. Laws of Boiling.=--The following statements have been found by\r\nexperiments to be true.\r\n\r\n1. Every liquid has its own _boiling_ point which under the same\r\nconditions of _pressure_ is always the same.\r\n\r\n2. The temperature of the boiling liquid remains at the boiling point\r\nuntil all the liquid is changed into vapor.\r\n\r\n3. The boiling point rises with increased pressure and falls if the\r\npressure is diminished.\r\n\r\n4. A boiling liquid and the vapor formed from it have the same\r\ntemperature. On cooling, a vapor will liquefy at the boiling point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--Distilling apparatus.]\r\n\r\n5. The solution of solid substances in a liquid raises its boiling\r\npoint, additional energy being needed to overcome the adhesion involved\r\nin the solution. The boiling point is also affected by the character of\r\nthe vessel containing the liquid. In glass the boiling point is 101°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.--A vacuum pan.]\r\n\r\n=187. Distillation of Water.=--Usually when solids are dissolved in\r\nliquids the vapor coming from the liquid contains none of the dissolved\r\nsolid. Thus by evaporating salt sea water, and collecting and condensing\r\nthe vapor, pure water is obtained. _Distillation_ is the process of\r\nboiling a liquid and condensing the vapor formed back again into a\r\nliquid. (See Fig. 155.) The liquid to be distilled is placed in vessel\r\n_F_ and boiled. The vapor is conducted into the tube _J_ which is\r\nsurrounded by a larger tube containing cold water. The vapor is\r\ncondensed on the cold walls of the tube. The resulting liquid is\r\ncollected in the vessel _R_. Distillation is employed for two purposes:\r\n(a) To remove impurities from a liquid (water is purified in this way).\r\n(b) Mixtures of different liquids having different boiling points may be\r\nseparated by distillation. The one having the lower boiling point will\r\nbe vaporized first. Thus a mixture of alcohol and water, on distillation\r\nyields a distillate having a much larger percentage of alcohol than at\r\nfirst. Repeating this process which is called _fractional distillation_\r\nyields alcohol of increasing strength of purity. Distilled liquor such\r\nas alcohol, brandy, and whisky are made by distilling fermented liquor,\r\nalcohol being made from fermented grains. Gasoline and kerosene are\r\ndistilled from crude petroleum. Sometimes as in the production of sugar\r\nor evaporated milk the object is to remove the water by evaporation in\r\norder to obtain the solid material. Since the two substances named are\r\ninjured by heating, the syrup, or milk is evaporated under reduced\r\npressure in a _vacuum pan_, that is in a boiler from which air and vapor\r\nare removed by an air pump. (See Fig. 156.)\r\n\r\n=188. Artificial Cooling.=--The fact has been brought out that when a\r\nsolid is melted, a certain amount of heat, called the heat of fusion, is\r\nabsorbed or disappears. This absorption of heat is also noticed when a\r\nsolid is liquefied by dissolving it in a liquid as well as when it is\r\nliquefied by simply applying heat. Thus if some table salt is placed in\r\na tumbler of water the temperature of the solution is lowered several\r\ndegrees below that of the salt and water used. The liquefaction or\r\nsolution of the salt has been accompanied by an absorption or\r\ndisappearance of heat. This heat has been taken from the salt and from\r\nthe water, resulting in a lowered temperature. Sal ammoniac or ammonium\r\nnitrate when dissolved in water produce a much more marked cooling\r\neffect than does table salt. The dissolving of a crystal in a liquid is\r\nsomething like evaporation, except that the molecules of the liquid\r\nattract the molecules of the solid and thus assist the change of state.\r\n\r\n=189. Freezing Mixtures.=--If one attempts to freeze a solution of salt\r\nand water, ice will not form at 0°C. but several degrees lower. The ice\r\nformed however is pure. Evidently the attraction of the molecules of\r\nsalt for the water molecules prevented the formation of ice until the\r\nmotions of the water molecules had been reduced more than is necessary\r\nin pure water. As the temperature of freezing water is that of melting\r\nice, ice in a salt solution melts at lower temperature than in pure\r\nwater. In a saturated salt solution this temperature is -22°C. It is\r\nfor this reason that the mixture of ice and salt used in freezing cream\r\nis so effective, the salt water in melting the ice, being cooled to a\r\ntemperature many degrees below the freezing point of the cream. The best\r\nproportion for a freezing mixture of salt and ice is one part salt to\r\nthree parts of finely powdered or shaved ice.\r\n\r\n=190. Refrigeration by Evaporation.=--Intense cold is also produced by\r\npermitting the rapid evaporation of liquids under pressure. Carbon\r\ndioxide under high pressure is a liquid, but when allowed to escape into\r\nthe air evaporates so rapidly that a portion of the liquid is frozen\r\ninto solid carbon dioxide which has a temperature of -80° C. The\r\nevaporation of liquid ammonia by permitting it to escape into a pipe,\r\nunder reduced pressure, is used on a large scale as a means of producing\r\ncold in cold storage and refrigeration plants. (See Fig. 157.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.--Diagram of a refrigerating system.]\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of the refrigerating system employing ammonia is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 157. The _compressor_ exhausts ammonia gas from the\r\ncoiled pipe in \"_E_\" and compresses the gas in \"_C_,\" where under 150\r\npounds pressure and the cooling effect of water it condenses to liquid\r\nammonia. This is allowed to pass slowly through the regulating valve,\r\nwhereupon it evaporates and expands in the long coiled pipe in \"_E_\" on\r\nits way back to the compressor. This evaporation and expansion causes a\r\nlarge amount of heat to be absorbed from the brine, cooling the latter\r\nbelow the freezing point of pure water and thus permitting the freezing\r\nof cans of water suspended in the brine. The chilled brine may also be\r\nsent through pipes in order to cool storage rooms containing meat or\r\nother food products. The ammonia absorbs heat when it vaporizes and\r\ngives up heat when it is compressed and liquified.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Necessity for Heat Energy.=--From early times man has been able to\r\ntransform motion into heat, and has used this ability in many directions\r\nas in starting fires and warming himself by friction. It took man many\r\ncenturies, however, to devise an effective machine for transforming heat\r\ninto mechanical energy or to use it in doing work.\r\n\r\nThe _power_ of a man is small and as long as the work of the world had\r\nto be done by man power, progress was retarded. When man began the use\r\nof beasts of burden, he took a long step in advance since one man could\r\nthen employ and direct the power of many men in the animals he\r\ncontrolled. Man also built water-wheels and windmills thus gaining power\r\ndirectly from the forces of nature and these added much to his working\r\nability. But he took the greatest step in gaining control over his\r\nsurroundings when he learned to use heat energy and to make it drive his\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n=192. Heat Engines.=--At the present time there is a great variety of\r\n_heat engines_ in use such as _steam_, _hot air_, _gas_, and _gasoline_\r\nengines, all using _heat energy_ to produce motion. The expansive power\r\nof steam when confined has been observed for hundreds of years and many\r\ndifferent machines have been invented to use it in doing work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.--Cross-section view of cylinder and steam chest\r\nof a steam engine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--The steam drives the piston to the left.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.--External view of steam engine.]\r\n\r\n=193. The Steam-engine.=--The man who perfected the steam-engine, and\r\ndevised its modern form was _James Watt_ (1736-1819). The essential\r\nparts and the action of the steam engine may be readily understood by\r\nstudying a diagram. In Fig. 158, _S_ stands for _steam chest_, _C_ for\r\n_cylinder_, _P_ for _piston_ and _v_ for _slide valve_. The first two\r\nare hollow iron boxes, the latter are parts that slide back and forth\r\nwithin them. The action of the steam engine is as follows: Steam under\r\npressure enters the steam chest, passes into the cylinder and pushes the\r\npiston to the other end. The slide valve is moved to its position in\r\nFig. 159. Steam now enters the right end of the cylinder, driving the\r\npiston to the left, the \"dead\" steam in the left end of the cylinder\r\nescaping at _E_ to the air. The slide valve is now shifted to its first\r\nposition and the process is repeated. It will assist the student to\r\nunderstand this action if he makes a cardboard model of these parts, the\r\npiston and slide valve being movable. In practical steam-engines, the\r\npiston rod is attached to a _crank rod_ fastened to a crank which turns\r\na wheel. (See Fig. 160.) The back and forth, or _reciprocating_ motion\r\nof the piston is by this means transformed into _rotary_ motion, just as\r\nin the sewing-machine the back-and-forth motion of the treadle produces\r\nrotary motion of the large wheel. Upon the shaft of the steam engine is\r\nfastened an _eccentric_ (see Fig. 163) which moves the slide valve. The\r\nsteam engine acts continuously as long as steam is supplied to it. Since\r\nit shifts the position of the slide valve automatically, it is called an\r\nautomatic steam engine. And because the team drives the piston both\r\nways, it is called a _double-acting_ steam engine. See Fig. 161 for a\r\nlength-section of a modern locomotive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.--Length-section of modern, fast-passenger\r\nlocomotive. _A_, cylinder valve--piston type valve; _B_,\r\ncylinder--piston at out end of stroke; _C_, boiler tubes--flues from\r\nfire-box; _D_, fire-tube type superheater; _E_, draught screen; _F-A_,\r\nfire-brick arch to protect tubes from direct heat; _F-B_, firebox; _G_,\r\ngrate; _H_, exhaust nozzle; _I_, safety valve nest; _T_, throttle lever;\r\n_R_, throttle rod; _Y_, throttle valve.]\r\n\r\n=194. The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.=--While watching workmen bore\r\nholes in cannon, Count Rumford, 1753-1814, noticed with much interest\r\nthe large amount of heat produced in the process. He observed that the\r\nheat developed seemed to have some relation to the work done upon the\r\ndrill in boring the holes. Later experiments performed by many men\r\nindicated that a definite relation exists between the heat produced by\r\nfriction and the amount of work done in overcoming the friction. This\r\ndiscovery indicates that in some way heat is related to energy and that\r\nheat is probably a form of energy. Later experiments have confirmed this\r\nidea, and it is now considered well established that _heat is a form of\r\nenergy_. Many attempts have been made to discover the relation between\r\nthe units of heat energy and the units of mechanical energy. To\r\nillustrate one method employed, suppose one measures a given _length_ in\r\ninches and in centimeters; on dividing one result by the other, it will\r\nbe found that a certain relation exists between the two sets of\r\nmeasurements, and that in every case that 1 in. equals 2.54 cm.\r\nSimilarly, when the same amount of _energy_ is measured both in heat\r\nunits and in work units a constant relation is always found between the\r\nunits employed. _One B.T.U. is found equivalent to 778 ft.-lbs. 1\r\ncalorie being equivalent to 42,700 g. cm. (427 g. m.)._ This relation is\r\ncalled the _mechanical equivalent of heat_, or in other words it\r\nrepresents the number of work units equivalent to one heat unit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--Apparatus for determining the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Gilbert (1540-1603), \"Father of magnetic\r\nphilosophy.\" Especially noted for his experiments and discoveries in\r\nmagnetism; first to use the word \"electricity.\" First man to practically\r\nemphasize experimental science.\r\n\r\n    DR. WILLIAM GILBERT\r\n    (Popular Science Monthly)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Prescott Joule (1818-1889), England, determined the\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat; discovered the relation between an\r\nelectric current and the heat produced; first proved experimentally the\r\nidentity of various forms of energy.\r\n\r\n    JAMES PRESCOTT JOULE\r\n    (Popular Science Monthly)]\r\n\r\nOne of the first successful experiments in determining the relation\r\nbetween work units and heat units was devised by Joule in England. (See\r\nportrait p. 217.) The experiment consisted in taking a can of metal\r\ncontaining water (Fig. 162) in which was placed a thermometer, and a rod\r\ncarrying paddles. The rod was turned by a cord connected through\r\nsuitable apparatus to heavy weights, _W_ and _W_. The energy represented\r\nby the downward motion of the weights through a given distance was\r\ncompared with the heat energy developed in the water as shown by its\r\nrise in temperature. Careful experiments showed that when 778 ft.-lbs.\r\nof work had been done by the moving weights the heat produced at the\r\nsame time would warm one pound of water 1 Fahrenheit degree. If the\r\nexperiment was performed using metric units, it was found that the\r\nexpenditure of 42,700 gram centimeters (427 gram meters) would result in\r\nproducing enough heat to warm one gram of water one centigrade degree.\r\nThe facts just given may be summarized as follows: _778 foot-pounds of\r\nenergy are equivalent to 1 British thermal unit and 42,700 gram\r\ncentimeters, or 427 gram meters, of energy are equivalent to 1 calorie_.\r\nThis relation of work units to heat units is called the _mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat_.\r\n\r\n=195. The Heat Equivalent of Fuels and Efficiency Tests of Engines.=--To\r\ndetermine the efficiency of a steam engine it is necessary to know not\r\nonly the mechanical equivalent of heat but also the heat produced by\r\nburning coal or gas; 1 lb. of average soft coal should produce about\r\n12,600 B.t.u. Now since 778 ft.-lbs. are equivalent to one B.t.u. the\r\nenergy produced when 2 lbs. of average soft coal is burned is 778 ×\r\n12,600 × 2 = 19,605,600 ft.-lbs. In actual practice 2 lbs. of average\r\nsoft coal burned will develop about 1 horse-power for 1 hour. 1\r\nhorse-power-hour = 33,000 ft.-lbs. × 60 = 1,980,000 ft.-lbs. Now\r\nefficiency equals (work out)/(work in) 1,980,000/19,605,600 = 1/10 or 10\r\nper cent.. This is the efficiency of a good steam engine. Ordinary ones\r\nrequire 3 lbs. of coal burned to each horse-power-hour produced or they\r\nare but 2/3 as efficient or have but about 7 per cent. efficiency.\r\n\r\nHEAT OF COMBUSTION OF VARIOUS FUELS\r\n\r\n     Data in this table are taken from U.

(Courtesy of\r\nthe \"Automobile Journal\")]\r\n\r\nThe common gasoline or gas engine is called a four-cycle (better\r\nfour-part cycle) engine (see Fig. 164), since it requires four\r\nmovements of the piston to complete one cycle or series of changes. This\r\nis illustrated in Fig. 165 =1=, which represents a cross-section of the\r\n_cylinder_ of the gasoline engine with the _piston_ moving downward. At\r\nthe upper end of the cylinder are two _ports_ or openings. One, the\r\n_exhaust_ port, is closed, the _inlet_ port is open and a mixture of gas\r\nand air is entering. Fig. 165 =2= shows the piston returning; both ports\r\nare closed and the \"charge\" of air and gas is being compressed. As the\r\npiston reaches the end of its stroke in compressing the charge, an\r\nelectric spark explodes or \"fires\" the charge of gas and air. The hot\r\nburning gas expands suddenly driving the piston downward with great\r\nforce (Fig. 165 =3=). The piston rod is attached to the crank of a heavy\r\nfly-wheel and this is given sufficient energy or momentum to keep it\r\ngoing through the next three strokes. Fig. 165 =4= represents the\r\nreturning piston pushing out the burnt \"charge\" through the open exhaust\r\nvalve _e_. On the next downward motion of the piston the valve _e_\r\ncloses. It opens, and new charges of gas and air enter and the \"cycle\"\r\nis repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--The four strokes of a gas engine cycle.]\r\n\r\nIn order to make the motion more even and continuous and also to secure\r\nmore power, more than one cylinder is attached to the same shaft and\r\nfly-wheel. Two, three, four, six, eight and even more cylinders have\r\nbeen attached to one shaft. Four or six cylinders are commonly used in\r\nautomobile gasoline motors. To lessen the sound of the \"exhaust,\" the\r\nlatter is sent through a \"muffler\" which often reduces the noise to a\r\nlow throbbing. (See Fig. 166.) The gasoline engine is more efficient\r\nthan the steam-engine, since the fuel, gas, is burned in the cylinder\r\nand not in a separate furnace. The combustion of the fuel in the\r\ncylinders makes some special cooling device necessary to prevent their\r\noverheating. This usually consists of a casing about the cylinders.\r\nBetween the cylinder and this casing is water which on being heated\r\npasses to a tank or radiator. In the radiator the water cools and then\r\nreturns to the space between the cylinders and casing thus keeping up\r\nthe circulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--An efficient automobile muffler. (_Courtesy\r\nPopular Science Monthly._)]\r\n\r\n=197. Efficiency of Gas Engines.=--One may test the _efficiency_ of a\r\ngas engine by determining the amount of power developed and comparing it\r\nwith the mechanical equivalent of the fuel burned. Illuminating gas is\r\nsometimes employed to drive gas engines. One cubic foot of illuminating\r\ngas should produce 600 B.T.U. when burned. The efficiency of the gas or\r\ngasoline engines is sometimes as high as 25 per cent. This engine is\r\nfree from smoke and is also compact and quickly started. While the fuel,\r\ngas or gasoline, is somewhat expensive it is light and easily carried.\r\nSuppose a gas engine produces 1 horse-power and uses 20 cu. ft. of gas\r\nan hour, what is its efficiency? 1 horse-power-hour = 550 × 60 × 60 =\r\n1,980,000 ft.-lbs. 20 cu. ft. of gas = 20 × 600 × 778 = 9,336,000\r\nft.-lbs.\r\n\r\nEfficiency = work out/work in = 1,980,000/9,336,000 = 21.2 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--The principle of the steam turbine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--Path of steam in DeLaval steam turbine. (_a_)\r\nand (_c_) movable blades, (_b_) stationary.]\r\n\r\n=198. The Steam Turbine.= One form of the steam-engine that is coming\r\ninto general use is the turbine. (See Fig. 167.) This consists of a\r\nshaft to which are attached blades, the shaft and blades being contained\r\nin a closed case. Steam is admitted by nozzles and strikes the blades so\r\nas to set them and the shaft in motion. There are also stationary blades\r\n(see Fig. 168), which assist in directing the steam effectively against\r\nthe rotating parts. The steam turbine is used for large power plants.\r\n(See Fig. 293.) It is very efficient, makes very little vibration, and\r\noccupies about one-tenth the floor space that a reciprocating engine of\r\nequal power uses. Some large ocean steamers are now driven by steam\r\nturbines.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. The gas engine, its construction, action and efficiency.\r\n\r\n2.

Magnets.=--Since the times of the early Greek philosophers men\r\nhave known of certain stones that have the property of attracting to\r\nthemselves objects of iron and steel. Such stones are called _natural\r\nmagnets_. It is thought by many that the name magnet is derived from\r\nMagnesia in Asia Minor, where these stones are abundant, though this is\r\nbut tradition.\r\n\r\nIt was also learned long ago that iron and steel objects when rubbed\r\nwith natural magnets become magnetized, that is, acquire the properties\r\nof magnets. These are said to be _artificial magnets_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--A bar magnet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.--A horseshoe magnet.]\r\n\r\nSome 800 years ago it was discovered that magnets, natural or\r\nartificial, when suspended so as to turn freely, always come to rest in\r\na definite position pointing approximately north or south. This is\r\nespecially noticeable when the magnet is long and narrow. Because of\r\nthis property of indicating direction, natural magnets were given the\r\nname of _lodestone_ (lode-leading).\r\n\r\nArtificial magnets are made by rubbing steel bars with a magnet or by\r\nplacing the steel bar in a coil of wire through which a current of\r\nelectricity is flowing. The magnetized steel bars may have any form,\r\nusually they are either straight or bent into a \"U\" shape. These forms\r\nare known as _bar_ and _horseshoe_ magnets. (See Figs. 169 and 170.)\r\nMagnets retain their strength best when provided with soft-iron\r\n\"_keepers_,\" as in Fig. 171.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.--Bar magnets with keepers.]\r\n\r\n=200. Magnetic Poles.=--If a magnet is placed in iron filings and\r\nremoved, the filings will be found to cling strongly at places near the\r\nends of the magnet, but for a portion of its length near the middle no\r\nattraction is found. (See Fig. 172.) These places of greatest attraction\r\non a magnet are called _poles_. If a bar magnet is suspended so as to\r\nswing freely about a vertical axis the magnetic pole at the end pointing\r\nnorth is called the _north-seeking_ pole; at the other end, is the\r\n_south-seeking_ pole. In most places the needle does not point to the\r\ntrue north, but somewhat to the east or west of north. The direction\r\ntaken by a magnetic needle is parallel to the _magnetic meridian_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.--Iron filings attracted to the poles of a\r\nmagnet.]\r\n\r\n=201. Law of Magnetic Action.=--The north pole of a magnet is usually\r\nmarked. If a marked bar magnet be held in the hand and its north-seeking\r\npole be brought near the north-seeking pole of a freely suspended bar\r\nmagnet, the two poles will be found to repel each other, as will also\r\ntwo south-seeking poles, while a north-seeking and a south-seeking pole\r\nattract each other. (See Fig. 173.) This action leads to the statement\r\nof the _Law of Magnetic Action_: _Like poles repel, while unlike poles\r\nattract each other._ The force of attraction or repulsion lessens as the\r\ndistance increases. _The force of the action between magnetic poles is\r\ninversely proportional to the square of the distance between them._\r\nCompare this with the law of gravitation (Art. 88).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.--Like poles of two magnets repel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.--A magnetoscope.]\r\n\r\n=202. Magnetic Substances and Properties.=--It is found that if an iron\r\nor steel magnet is heated _red hot_ that its magnetic properties\r\ndisappear. Accordingly one method of _demagnetizing_ a magnet is to\r\nraise it to a red heat. If a magnet that has been heated red hot and\r\nthen cooled is brought near a suspended bar magnet, it is found to\r\n_attract either_ end, showing that it has regained _magnetic properties_\r\neven though it has lost its _magnetic polarity_. A suspended bar magnet\r\nused to test the magnetic properties of a body is called a\r\n_magnetoscope_. (See Fig. 174.) The needle of a _magnetic compass_\r\nserves very well as a magnetoscope. Magnetic properties are most\r\nstrongly exhibited by iron and steel, though nickel and cobalt show some\r\nmagnetic effects. There is a peculiar alloy of copper, aluminum, and\r\nmanganese, known as _Heusler's Alloy_, that is also magnetic. However,\r\nof all substances, iron and steel show the strongest magnetic effects.\r\n\r\n=203. Magnetic Induction.=--Let the north-seeking pole of a bar magnet\r\nsupport an iron nail by its head. (See Fig. 175.) Test the point of the\r\nnail for polarity. See whether a second nail can be attached by its head\r\nto the point of the first. Test the polarity of the point of this nail.\r\nFind by trial how many nails can be suspended in succession from the\r\nmagnet. Test in each case for polarity. Withdraw carefully the magnet\r\nfrom the first nail--the string of nails will fall apart. Repeat the\r\ntest with a thickness of paper between the magnet and the first nail.\r\nResults similar to those secured at first will be found, though probably\r\nfewer nails will be supported. The presence of paper between the magnet\r\nand nails simply weakens the action. Test the action of the magnet upon\r\nthe nail when there is between them a piece of glass, one's thumb, thin\r\npieces of wood, copper, zinc, etc. _The magnetizing of a piece of iron\r\nor steel by a magnet near or touching it is called magnetic induction._\r\nThis action takes place through all substances except large bodies of\r\niron or steel hence these substances are often used as _magnetic\r\nscreens_. The pole of the new _induced magnet_ adjacent to the bar\r\nmagnet is just opposite to the pole used. Thus the N.-pole of the magnet\r\nused will produce a S.-pole at the near end of the nail and a N.-pole at\r\nthe end farther away. (See Fig. 175.) On removing the magnet, the nails\r\nare found to retain a part of their induced magnetism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.--Nails magnetized by induction.]\r\n\r\n=204. Retentivity.=--In several of the foregoing paragraphs it has been\r\nseen that a piece of iron or steel when once magnetized does not\r\nentirely lose its magnetism when the magnetizing force is removed.\r\nDifferent pieces of iron and steel vary greatly in this respect, some\r\nremaining strongly magnetized, others losing much of their magnetism.\r\n_This property of retaining magnetism is called retentivity._ Hardened\r\nsteel has a high degree of retentivity, while soft iron retains but\r\nlittle magnetism.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Magnet; natural, artificial, bar, horseshoe.\r\n\r\n2. Magnetic poles; north seeking, south seeking.\r\n\r\n3. Law of action, magnetoscope, retentivity, induced magnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1. Make a summary of the facts of magnetism presented in this lesson.\r\n\r\n2. Is magnetism matter, force, or energy? How do you decide? To what\r\nother phenomenon that we have studied is it similar? How?\r\n\r\n3. Make a simple magnetoscope for yourself by suspending a thin steel\r\nneedle or rod 5 to 10 cm. long, with a light thread or silk fiber at its\r\ncenter, so that it will hang level. Then magnetize the needle, and keep\r\nthe magnetoscope in your book.\r\n\r\n4. Name three uses for magnets or magnetism.\r\n\r\n5. Mention three uses for a magnetoscope.\r\n\r\n6. Are all magnets produced by induction? Explain.\r\n\r\n7. In what magnetic devices is a high retentivity desirable?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) THE THEORY OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC FIELDS\r\n\r\n=205. The Theory of Magnetism.=--If a magnetized watch spring is broken\r\nin two, _each part_ is found to be a magnet. If one of these parts be\r\nbroken and this process of breaking be continued as far as possible, the\r\nsmallest part obtained has two poles and is in fact a complete magnet.\r\n(See Fig. 176.) It is supposed that if the division could be continued\r\nfar enough that each of the _molecules of the steel spring_ would be\r\nfound to have _two poles_ and to be a magnet. In other words, magnetism\r\nis believed to be _molecular_. Other evidence supporting this idea is\r\nfound in the fact that when a magnet is heated red hot, to a temperature\r\nof violent molecular motion, its magnetism disappears. Also if a long,\r\nfine soft iron wire be strongly magnetized, a light jar causes its\r\nmagnetism to disappear. This would lead us to believe that magnetism is\r\nnot a property of the surface of the body, but that it depends upon\r\nmolecular structure or the arrangement of the molecules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.--Effect of breaking a magnet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.--Possible arrangement of molecules in an\r\nunmagnetized iron bar.]\r\n\r\nIt is believed also that the _molecules_ of a magnetic substance are\r\nmagnets at all times; that before the body is magnetized the molecules\r\nare arranged haphazard (see Fig. 177) but that when a magnet is brought\r\nnear, the molecules tend to arrange themselves in line, with their\r\nnorth-seeking poles pointing in the same direction. (See Fig. 178.) If\r\nthe magnet is jarred some of the molecules tend to get out of line,\r\nperhaps to form little closed chains of molecules. (See Fig. 177.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.--Arrangement of molecules in a saturated\r\nmagnet.]\r\n\r\n=206. Magnetic Fields and Lines of Force.=--The behavior of magnets is\r\nbetter understood after observing and studying the _lines of force_ of\r\na magnet. The earliest descriptions of these are by William Gilbert, the\r\nfirst Englishman to appreciate fully the value of making experimental\r\nobservations. He wrote a book in 1600 called _De Magnete_ in which he\r\npublished his experiments and discoveries in magnetism. (See p. 217.)\r\n\r\nMagnetic lines of force may be observed by placing a magnet upon the\r\ntable, then laying upon it a sheet of paper and sprinkling over the\r\nlatter fine iron filings. On gently tapping the paper, the filings\r\narrange themselves along curved lines extending from one end of the\r\nmagnet to the other. These are called the _magnetic lines of force_.\r\n(See Fig. 179.) The space about a magnet in which the magnetic lines are\r\nfound is called the _magnetic field_. (See Fig. 180.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.--Iron filings on paper over a bar magnet.]\r\n\r\nMany interesting things have been discovered concerning the lines of\r\nforce. Some of the facts of magnetic action are given a simple\r\nexplanation if we think of them as due to the magnetic lines of force. A\r\nsummary of several discoveries concerning magnetic fields follows:\r\n\r\n(A) Magnetic lines of force run side by side and do not cross one\r\nanother. (See magnetic fields.)\r\n\r\n(B) Magnetic lines of force are believed to form \"_closed curves_\" or to\r\nbe continuous. The part outside of the magnet is a continuation of the\r\npart within the magnet. (See Fig. 180.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.--Diagram of the field of a bar magnet.]\r\n\r\n(C) The attraction of a magnet is strongest where the magnetic lines are\r\nthickest, hence they are believed to be the means by which a magnet\r\nattracts.\r\n\r\n(D) Since like poles repel and unlike poles attract, it is known that\r\nthe action along a line of force is not the same in both directions. It\r\nhas therefore been agreed by physicists to indicate by an arrow head\r\n(Fig. 180), the direction that a north-seeking pole tends to move along\r\na line of force. The lines of force are considered as leaving the\r\nnorth-seeking pole of a magnet and entering the south-seeking pole. (See\r\nFigs. 181 and 182.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.--Magnetic field between like poles showing\r\nrepulsion.]\r\n\r\n(E) A freely suspended small magnet in a magnetic field places itself\r\nparallel to the lines of force. (Test this by holding a magnetic compass\r\nin different portions of a magnetic field). Note the position of the\r\nneedle and the lines of force. This fact indicates that the compass\r\nneedle points north on account of its tendency to turn so as to be\r\nparallel to the earth's magnetic held.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.--Magnetic field between unlike poles showing\r\nattraction.]\r\n\r\n(F) Each magnet is accompanied by its own magnetic field. When a piece\r\nof iron is brought within the field of a magnet the lines of force\r\npassing through the iron tend to arrange the iron molecules in line or\r\nto magnetize the iron.\r\n\r\n=207. Magnetic Induction.=--The action of magnetic lines of force in\r\nmagnetizing iron when they pass through it, is called _Magnetic\r\nInduction_. This may now be defined as _the production of magnetism in a\r\nbody by placing it within a magnetic field_. Freely suspended magnets\r\nplace themselves parallel to the lines of force in a magnetic field,\r\ntherefore when an iron rod is placed in a weak field, or one with few\r\nlines of force, the iron is but slightly magnetized; that is, but few\r\nmolecules are brought into line. Increasing the strength of the\r\nmagnetizing field, gives stronger magnetization to the iron up to a\r\ncertain point. After this, stronger fields give no increase in\r\nmagnetizing effect. When iron exhibits its greatest magnetization it is\r\nsaid to be _saturated_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.--Effect of a piece of iron in a magnetic\r\nfield.]\r\n\r\n=208. Permeability.=--If a piece of iron is placed between the poles of\r\na horseshoe magnet, the \"field\" obtained by sprinkling iron filings upon\r\na sheet of paper over the magnet resembles that shown in Fig. 183. The\r\nlines in the space between the poles of the magnet seem to crowd in to\r\nthe piece of iron. The _property_ of the iron by which it tends to\r\nconcentrate and increase the number of lines of force of a magnetic\r\nfield is called _permeability_. Soft iron shows high permeability.\r\nMarked differences in behavior are shown by different kinds of iron and\r\nsteel when placed in a magnetic field. Very pure iron, or _soft_ iron,\r\nis strongly magnetized by a magnetic field of medium strength. Its\r\nmagnetism, however, is quickly lost when the magnetizing field is\r\nremoved. This indicates that soft-iron molecules are easily swung into\r\nline, but also disarrange themselves as easily when removed from a\r\nmagnetizing force. Soft-iron magnets having high permeability quickly\r\nlose their magnetism. They are therefore called temporary magnets. On\r\nthe other hand a hardened steel bar is difficult to magnetize, but when\r\nonce magnetized retains its magnetism permanently, unless some action\r\nweakens the magnet. Such magnets are called _permanent_ magnets.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The term \"line of force\" as used in this text means the same\r\n     as \"line of induction\" as used in more advanced texts.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

The Earth's Magnetic Field.=--Dr. William Gilbert's famous book,\r\n_De Magnete_, contains many helpful and suggestive ideas, none perhaps\r\nmore important than his explanation of the behavior of the compass\r\nneedle. He assumed that the earth is a magnet, with a _south-seeking_\r\npole near the geographical north pole, and with a _north-seeking_ pole\r\nnear the geographical south pole. This idea has since been shown to be\r\ncorrect. The north magnetic (or south-seeking) pole was found in 1831,\r\nby Sir James Ross in Boothia Felix, Canada. Its approximate present\r\nlocation as determined by Captain Amundsen in 1905 is latitude 70° 5´\r\nN. and longitude 96° 46´ W. The south magnetic pole is in latitude 72°\r\nS., longitude 155° 16´ E. The north magnetic pole is continually\r\nchanging its position. At present it is moving slowly westward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.--Magnetic map of the earth for 1910. Isogonic\r\nlines ------ Isoclinic lines - - - -]\r\n\r\n=210. Direction of the Earth's Magnetic Field.=--Reference has been made\r\nto the fact that the compass does not always point exactly north. This\r\nindicates that the earth's magnetic field varies in its direction.\r\nColumbus discovered this fact upon his first voyage. The discovery\r\nalarmed the sailors since they feared they might come to a place where\r\nthe compass would be unreliable. This variation is called _declination_.\r\nIt is defined as the _angle between the direction of the needle and the\r\ngeographical meridian_. Declination is due to the fact that the\r\ngeographical and magnetic poles do not coincide. What is meant by a\r\ndeclination of 90°? Lines drawn upon a map so as to pass through places\r\nof the same declination are called _isogonic_ lines. The line passing\r\nthrough points where the needle points north, without declination, is\r\nthe _agonic_ line. The agonic line is slowly moving westward. It now\r\npasses near Lansing, Michigan; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Charleston, S.\r\nCarolina. (See Fig. 184.) At all points in the United States and Canada\r\neast of the agonic line the declination is _west_, at points west of the\r\nagonic line the declination is _east_.\r\n\r\n=211. The Dipping Needle.=--Mount an unmagnetized steel needle on a\r\n_horizontal_ axis so as to be in neutral equilibrium, that is, so as to\r\nremain balanced in any position in which it is left. Upon being\r\nmagnetized and placed so that it can swing in a north and south plane,\r\nthe north-seeking pole will now be found to be depressed, the needle\r\nforming an angle of nearly 70° with the horizontal. (See Fig. 185.) The\r\nposition assumed by the needle indicates that the earth's magnetic field\r\ninstead of being horizontal in the United States _dips_ down at an\r\nangle of about 70°. Over the magnetic pole, the _dipping needle_ as it\r\nis called, is vertical. At the earth's equator it is nearly horizontal.\r\n_The angle between a horizontal plane and the earth's magnetic lines of\r\nforce is called the inclination or dip._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.--A dipping needle.]\r\n\r\n=212. Inductive Effect of the Earth's Magnetic Field.=--The earth's\r\nmagnetic lines of force are to be considered as filling the space above\r\nthe earth, passing through all objects on the surface and into and\r\nthrough the earth's interior. The _direction_ of the earth's field is\r\nshown by the compass and the dipping needle. Magnetic lines of force\r\ntend to crowd into and follow iron and steel objects on account of their\r\npermeability. Therefore, iron or steel objects, such as posts, columns,\r\netc., are permeated by the earth's lines of force, which in the United\r\nStates enter at the top of these objects and leave at the bottom. The\r\nlines of force passing through these bodies arrange their molecules in\r\nline or magnetize the bodies. The _inductive effect_ of the earth's\r\nmagnetism indicates how lodestones or natural magnets acquire their\r\nmagnetized condition. So far as is known, magnetism produces no effect\r\nupon the human body. It can therefore be studied only by observing its\r\neffects upon magnets or bodies affected by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\nThe earth's magnetic field, dip, declination, agonic line, induction by\r\nthe earth's field.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1.

Electrical Charges.=--The ideas gained in the study of magnetism\r\nare of assistance in the study of electricity in giving some fundamental\r\nideas and principles that will often be referred to as a basis for\r\ncomparing the actions of magnetized and electrified bodies. The process\r\nof electrifying a body is very different from that of magnetizing it.\r\nThus if a rubber comb or rod be rubbed with a woolen cloth the object\r\nrubbed is able to attract to itself light bits of paper, thread, etc.\r\nThis peculiar attraction was noticed and recorded by the ancient Greeks,\r\n600 B.C., when it was found that amber when rubbed would attract light\r\nobjects to itself. For a long time it was supposed that amber was the\r\nonly substance showing this property. Dr. William Gilbert, however,\r\ndiscovered that the electrified condition could be produced by rubbing a\r\ngreat variety of substances. He named the _result_ produced,\r\n_electrification_, after the Greek name for amber (_elektron_). A body\r\nlike hard rubber or amber which will attract light objects when rubbed\r\nis said to be _electrified_, or to have been given a _charge_ of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n=214. Law of Electric Action.=--Let a vulcanite rod be electrified by\r\nrubbing with a woolen cloth until it will attract light objects; then\r\nplace it in a wire stirrup suspended by a silk thread. If a second\r\nvulcanite rod is similarly electrified and brought near the first, the\r\ntwo will be found to repel. (See Fig. 186.) If now a glass rod be\r\nrubbed with silk and brought near the suspended rod, the two will\r\n_attract_. This difference in behavior indicates a difference in the\r\nelectrification or charge upon the rods. The two charged vulcanite rods\r\nrepelling and the charged glass and vulcanite attracting indicate _the\r\nlaw of electric action_. _Like charges repel each other and unlike\r\ncharges attract each other._ Extensive experiments with all kinds of\r\nsubstances indicate that there are but two kinds of electrical charges.\r\nThe electrical charge upon glass when rubbed with silk or wool is called\r\n_positive_, and that upon hard rubber or vulcanite when rubbed with wool\r\nis called _negative_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.--Repulsion of like charges.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.--An aluminum foil electroscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.--A proof plane.]\r\n\r\n=215. The Electroscope and its Uses.=--An electroscope is a device\r\nemployed to test the presence of an electrical charge. The _aluminum\r\nfoil electroscope_ consists of a flask closed by a rubber stopper\r\nthrough which passes a rod which ends at the top in a ball or plate and\r\nbelow is attached two narrow leaves of thin aluminum-foil. Ordinarily\r\nthe two leaves hang close together and parallel but if a charged body is\r\nbrought near the electroscope the leaves spread apart at the bottom.\r\n(See Fig. 187.) The _kind of charge_ upon a body may be determined with\r\nan electroscope as follows: Make a _proof-plane_ by sealing a small\r\nmetal disc on the end of a hard rubber rod. (See Fig. 188.) Touch the\r\ndisc of the proof-plane first to a charged rubber rod and then to the\r\ntop of the electroscope. The leaves of the latter will separate showing\r\nthat the electroscope is charged. This charge remains after the\r\nproof-plane is removed. If the charged vulcanite rod is brought near the\r\nelectroscope, the leaves separate further That is, a charge _like_ that\r\non the electroscope makes the leaves separate further. But if an\r\n_unlike_ charge, as that on a positively charged glass rod, is\r\ncautiously brought near, the leaves will be seen to move together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189.--Rod with woolen cap.]\r\n\r\n=216. Two Charges are Produced at the Same Time.=--A closely fitting\r\nwoolen cover or cap some 3 in. long is made for the end of a vulcanite\r\nrod. A silk thread attached to the cap enables one to hold the latter\r\nwhile the rod is turned within it. (See Fig. 189.) If the rod bearing\r\nthe cap is held near a charged electroscope little or no effect is\r\nnoticed. If now the cap is removed by the silk thread and held near the\r\nelectroscope, it will be found to be positively charged while the rod is\r\nnegatively charged. The fact that no result is seen when the cap and rod\r\nare together, indicates that one charge neutralizes the other. In other\r\nwords, _the charges_ must _be equal_. This illustrates the truth that\r\n_when electrification is produced by friction, the two objects rubbed\r\ntogether acquire equal and opposite charges_.\r\n\r\n=217. Charging by Contact and Conduction.=--If a small pith ball is\r\nsuspended by a silk thread, a charged rod brought near is at first\r\nattracted, but after contact is repelled (see Fig. 190) showing that the\r\nball has become charged with the same kind of electrification that is\r\nupon the rod. That is, a charge given to an object by _contact_ with a\r\ncharged body is of the _same kind_ as that upon the charged one. The\r\nproof-plane in Art. 215 carries the same kind of charge that is upon the\r\nrod it is charged from. Some substances have the ability to transfer\r\ncharges of electrification. These are called _conductors_, those that do\r\nnot conduct electrification are _insulators_. The conducting power of a\r\nbody is readily tested by placing one end of a rod of the material upon\r\nthe top of an electroscope and the other end upon an insulated support,\r\nas in Fig. 191. If now a charge be put in contact with the body of _a_,\r\nthe electroscope will show by its leaves whether the rod tested conducts\r\nor not. The leaves separate instantly when conducting substances are\r\ntested, while no action results with insulators. In testing some\r\nmaterials for conductivity the leaves are found to diverge gradually.\r\nSuch bodies are said to be _poor_ conductors. All degrees of\r\nconductivity are found. The metals are the best conductors. The best\r\ninsulators are rubber, mica, shellac, glass, silk, porcelain, paraffin,\r\nand oils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190.--The pith ball charged by contact is repelled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.--Testing for conductivity.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Have you ever produced electrification by friction outside of a\r\nlaboratory? Explain.\r\n\r\n5. Are the rods upon which we produce electrification by friction,\r\nconductors or insulators? How do you explain this?\r\n\r\n6. Are conductors or insulators of the greater importance in practical\r\nelectricity? Explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) ELECTRIC FIELDS AND ELECTROSTATIC INDUCTION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.--An electric field about a positively charged\r\nshell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.--A \"detector.\"]\r\n\r\n=218. Electrical Fields.=--In our study of magnetism we learned that a\r\nmagnet affects objects about it by its magnetic lines of force. In a\r\nsimilar way it is assumed that a charged body produces electrical\r\neffects upon its surroundings by _electric lines of force_. For example,\r\nthe attraction that a charged body exerts upon light objects through\r\nshort distances or the influence of a charge upon an electroscope\r\nseveral feet away, is said to be due to the _electric field_ about the\r\ncharged body. (See Fig. 192.) The presence of the electric lines of\r\nforce may be shown by placing a perforated, slender, diamond-shaped\r\npiece of tissue paper upon a light glass pointer (Fig. 193). When\r\nplaced in an electric field the tissue paper \"detector\" places itself\r\nparallel to the lines of force. Electric lines of force are said to\r\nextend from a positive to a negative charge. (See Fig. 194.) The\r\ndirection shown by the arrow upon the lines is that along which a small\r\npositive charge tends to move. Electric lines of force unlike those from\r\nmagnets are _not_ continuous. They extend from a positive charge to a\r\nnegative charge. Therefore each positive charge is connected by lines of\r\nforce to a negative charge somewhere. These ideas of electric fields are\r\nof much assistance in explaining many electrical effects. Electrical\r\nfields between _oppositely_ charged shells will be found similar to Fig.\r\n194, while between shells with like charges, fields are found as in Fig.\r\n195.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194.--Electric field between unlike charges.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195.--Electric field between like charges.]\r\n\r\n=219. Electrostatic Induction.=--If a charged body is brought near an\r\naluminum-foil electroscope, the leaves separate. (See Fig. 198.) The\r\nnearer the charge is brought the wider the leaves spread, but when the\r\ncharge is removed, the leaves collapse showing that nothing was given to\r\nthe electroscope. It was simply affected by the charge in its vicinity.\r\n_This production of an electrified condition in a body by the influence\r\nof a charge near it is called electrostatic induction._ Placing\r\ninsulators, such as a sheet of glass, between the charge and the\r\nelectroscope does not affect the result, which is apparently brought\r\nabout by the action of the electric lines of force. These lines of force\r\nextend without difficulty _through uncharged insulators_ and terminate\r\noften at the surface of a conductor, where their influence causes a\r\ncharge to accumulate. _Charged insulators_, however, do affect inductive\r\naction. This may be noticed by using a sensitive electroscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196.--Production of two charges by the influence of\r\na third charge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197.--The two charges separated.]\r\n\r\n=220. Electrical Separation by Induction.=--The action just described\r\nmay be illustrated further by taking two insulated, uncharged brass\r\nshells, _A_ and _B_. (See Fig. 196.) Bring a charged vulcanite rod near\r\nshell \"_A_\" while the shells are touching each other. Then remove shell\r\n_B_ (Fig. 197) while the rod remains near _A_. On testing the shells for\r\nelectrification, _A_ is found to possess a positive charge. This action\r\nis in some respects similar to magnetic induction, for if one places a\r\nnorth-seeking pole near a piece of iron, the iron develops by induction\r\na south-seeking pole at the end nearest the magnet and a north-seeking\r\nat the other end. There is, however, one striking difference. If the\r\nmagnetized iron be separated into two parts, each part is a complete\r\nmagnet possessing two unlike poles; while if the object affected by\r\nelectrostatic induction is separated into two parts _one part_ has a\r\n_positive_ charge and the other a _negative_ charge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.--Effect of a charged rod near an electroscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199.--When a finger is touched to the top of the\r\nelectroscope, the repelled negative charge escapes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 200.--The electroscope is now positively charged.]\r\n\r\n=221. Charging a body by induction= is easily accomplished. To charge an\r\naluminum-foil electroscope by induction bring _near_ (say 10 cm.) from\r\nthe top of the electroscope a charged rubber rod. (See Fig. 198.) The\r\nseparated leaves show the presence of the repelled or _negative_ charge,\r\nthe _positive_ charge being on the disc at the top. If while the charged\r\nrod is held near, the metal top of the electroscope is touched by the\r\nfinger the leaves at once fall together showing that the repelled\r\nnegative charge has escaped from the electroscope (Fig. 199). On\r\nremoving _first_ the _finger_ and next the charged rod, the positive\r\ncharge spreads over the metal parts of the electroscope, as is shown by\r\nthe separation of the leaves (Fig. 200). The electroscope is now\r\n_charged positively_ by induction. If the charged rubber rod is brought\r\nto about 30 cm. from the electroscope, its leaves tend to move\r\ntogether. If a body charged similarly to the electroscope or\r\n_positively_, is moved toward the electroscope the leaves separate\r\nfurther. This behavior of the electroscope enables one to determine the\r\n_kind_ of charge upon a body.\r\n\r\nTwo principles of _electrostatic_ induction may now be stated: (1) Two\r\n_equal_, _unlike_ charges are always produced by _electrostatic_\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\n(2) If the body affected by induction is connected to the earth by a\r\nconductor, the repelled or \"_free_\" charge is conducted away from the\r\nbody while the \"_bound_\" charge is held by the inducing charge.\r\n\r\nThese principles apply in every case of induction.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Does electrostatic induction occur outside of laboratories? Where?\r\nWhen?\r\n\r\n4. Given a charged rubber rod, how may one charge from it by induction,\r\ninsulated brass shells, giving some a positive and some a negative\r\ncharge?\r\n\r\n5. How may the charges upon the shells be tested?\r\n\r\n6. In charging an electroscope by induction, why must the finger be\r\nremoved before the glass rod?\r\n\r\n7. Why is it best to have the rubber and glass rods, used in\r\nelectrification, warmer than the air of the room in which the\r\nexperiments are being performed?\r\n\r\n8. When a sharp metallic point is held near the knob of a charged\r\nelectroscope the leaves quickly come together. Explain.\r\n\r\n9. Might one of the members of your class in physics be charged with\r\nelectricity, if he should stand on a board supported by dry glass\r\ninsulators? Explain.\r\n\r\n10. If a metal can is charged strongly while standing on an insulator,\r\ntests made by means of the proof-plane and electroscope show no charge\r\non the inside. Explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) ELECTRICAL THEORIES AND DISTRIBUTION OF CHARGES\r\n\r\n=222. Franklin's Theory of Electricity.=--We have studied the production\r\nof electrification by friction and induction. It will be helpful now to\r\nconsider some of the theories of electricity. From the ease with which\r\nelectrification moves, along a conductor, many have imagined that\r\nelectricity is a fluid. Benjamin Franklin's _One Fluid Theory_ held that\r\na _positive_ charge consisted in an accumulation or an excess of\r\nelectricity while a _negative_ charge implies a deficiency or less than\r\nthe usual amount. This theory led to representing positive\r\nelectrification by a plus (+) sign and _negative_, by a minus (-) sign.\r\nThese signs are in general use to-day. The use and significance of these\r\nsigns should be clearly fixed in mind.\r\n\r\n=223. The Electron Theory.=--Various discoveries and experiments made in\r\nrecent years indicate, however, that _negative_ electricity consists of\r\nlittle _corpuscles_ or _electrons_ which may pass readily from one\r\nmolecule of a conductor to another while their movement through an\r\ninsulator is much retarded if not entirely prevented. This theory,\r\nsometimes called the _Electron Theory_, holds that each atom of a\r\nsubstance has as a nucleus a corpuscle of _positive_ electricity, and\r\nsurrounding it, minute negative corpuscles or electrons. It is thought\r\nthat the electrons in the atom are very much smaller than the positive\r\ncharges and are revolving about the latter with great rapidity.\r\nOrdinarily, the positive and negative charges are equal so that the atom\r\nis in a neutral or uncharged condition. By the action of various forces\r\nsome of the _negative_ corpuscles within a conductor may be moved from\r\nmolecule to molecule. Thus if a negatively charged rod is brought near a\r\nconductor, many electrons stream away to the far end charging it\r\n_negatively_, while the nearer end of the conductor is left with fewer\r\nelectrons than usual along with the fixed positive corpuscles. Hence the\r\nnear end is positively charged. (See Fig. 198.) On the other hand, if a\r\npositive charge is used, it attracts the electrons from the far end,\r\nleaving the immovable positive corpuscles there, and that end becomes\r\npositively electrified, while the nearer end with its surplus of\r\nelectrons is, of course, negatively electrified.\r\n\r\nThe Electron Theory is considered well founded since the electrons have\r\n(a) had their _mass_ determined, (b) their _speed_ measured, (c) their\r\n_electric charge_ determined, (d) and their _behavior_ while _passing\r\nthrough magnetic_ and _electric fields_ observed. These facts and other\r\nexperimental evidence have demonstrated the existence of electrons. The\r\npositive corpuscle has not been directly observed but is assumed to\r\nexist to account for the effects observed in induction, charging by\r\nfriction, etc.\r\n\r\n=224. Distribution of an Electric Charge upon a Conductor.=--We have\r\napplied the electron theory in explaining the phenomenon of\r\nelectrostatic induction. Let us now use it in studying the distribution\r\nof an electric charge upon a conductor. Let a cylindrical metal vessel\r\nopen at the top and insulated by being placed upon pieces of sealing wax\r\nhave a charge of negative electricity given it. (See Fig. 201.) On now\r\ntaking a proof plane and attempting to obtain a charge from the\r\n_interior_ of the vessel no result is found, while a charge is readily\r\nobtained from the _outside_ of the dish. This result is explained by\r\nconsidering that the electrons are mutually self-repellent and in their\r\nattempt to separate as widely as possible pass to the outer surface of\r\nthe vessel. This same condition is also true of a dish made of woven\r\nwire. If the charged conductor is not spherical in outline, an uneven\r\ndistribution of the charge is observed. Thus if an _egg-shaped_\r\nconductor is insulated and charged (see Fig. 202), a proof plane touched\r\nto the broad end of the body and then to an electroscope causes a\r\ncertain divergence of the leaves of the latter. If now a charge be taken\r\nfrom the _pointed_ end by the proof plane to the uncharged electroscope,\r\na greater spreading of the leaves than before will be noticed. This\r\nindicates that the electricity may be unevenly distributed over the\r\nsurface of a body. It is found that the _electric density_, as it is\r\ncalled, is greatest where the surface curves most sharply. At a very\r\nsharp curve, as at a point, the electric density may be so great that a\r\npart of the charge escapes into the air. (See Fig. 203.) For this reason\r\nelectric conductors on which it is desired to _keep_ an electric charge\r\nhave round surfaces and all sharp points and corners are avoided. While\r\nconductors, such as lightning rods, which are designed to facilitate the\r\nescape of electric charges, are provided with a number of sharp points\r\nat the end or elsewhere. At such points, air particles are drawn\r\nforcibly against the point and after being charged are driven away\r\nstrongly, creating the so-called _electrical wind_ which carries away\r\nthe charge at a rapid rate. (See Fig. 203.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.--No charge is found inside a hollow vessel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.--More charge at the pointed end.]\r\n\r\n=225. Lightning and Electricity.=--The fact that lightning is an\r\nelectrical discharge was first shown in 1752 by Benjamin Franklin, who\r\ndrew electric charges from a cloud by flying a kite in a thunderstorm.\r\nWith the electricity which passed down the kite string he performed a\r\nnumber of electrical experiments. This discovery made Franklin famous\r\namong scientific men everywhere. Franklin then suggested the use of\r\nlightning rods to protect buildings from lightning. These rods act as\r\nconductors for the electric discharge and thus prevent it from passing\r\nthrough the building, with the risk of overheating some part and setting\r\nthe latter on fire. The points provided at the top of lightning rods are\r\nbelieved to aid in preventing strokes of lightning by the _silent\r\ndischarge_ of the so-called electric wind which tends to quietly unite\r\nthe charges in the clouds and on the earth beneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203.--Electrical wind produced by a pointed\r\nconductor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204.--Electrical whirl. The reaction from the\r\nelectrical wind causes it to revolve.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 205. The wire screen protects the electroscope.]\r\n\r\nThe charge in an electrified cloud acts inductively upon the earth\r\nbeneath, attracting an opposite charge to the objects below. The\r\ndischarge from the cloud often passes to the objects beneath, such as\r\ntrees or buildings. _Thunder_ is believed to be due to the sudden\r\nexpansion of the air when intensely heated by the electric discharge\r\nand its sudden contraction, like a _slap_, as the track instantly cools.\r\nThunder at a distance is usually followed by rumblings due to changes in\r\nthe intensity of the sound mainly due to reflections of sound waves from\r\nclouds and other reflecting surfaces.\r\n\r\n=226. An electric screen= is a device for cutting off the influence of\r\nan electric charge. Faraday found that if a sensitive electroscope is\r\nsurrounded by a wire mesh screen (see Fig. 205), no evidence of\r\nelectrification could be found inside. In other words, a network of\r\nconductors on a building makes the best protection against lightning,\r\nprovided it is connected to the earth by good conductors at several\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Conditions Causing a Movement of Electricity.=--In the study of\r\nconductors and insulators it was observed that an electric charge moved\r\nalong the conducting rod to the electroscope. This _movement_ of\r\n_electricity_ along a conductor is a result of great practical\r\nimportance. We will now consider the conditions that produce the \"flow\"\r\nor \"current\" of electricity. Let two electroscopes stand near each\r\nother. Charge one, _C´_ (Fig. 206), strongly and charge the other\r\nslightly. If now a light stiff wire attached to a stick of sealing wax\r\nbe placed so as to connect the tops of the electroscopes, the leaves of\r\n_C_ will partly close while those of _D_ will open slightly, thus\r\nindicating a movement of electricity from _C_ to _D_ along the wire. The\r\nmovement was from a place of greater degree of electrification to one of\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206.--Electricity flows from high to low potential.]\r\n\r\n=228. Potential.=--The _potential_ of an electrified body is its\r\n_degree_ of _electrification_. Therefore, it is said that electroscope\r\n_C_ mentioned above has a greater potential than electroscope _D_. The\r\nmovement of electricity is from a place of greater or _high_ potential\r\nto one of lesser or _low_ potential. If two bodies are at the _same_\r\npotential there will be found no movement of electricity between them. A\r\n_difference_ of _potential_ between two points connected by a conductor\r\nis therefore the _necessary condition_ for an electric current. Just as\r\nheat is transmitted along a conductor from a place of high to one of\r\nlower temperature, so electricity is transmitted along a conductor from\r\na place of high to one of low potential. Thus potential in electricity\r\ncorresponds to temperature in heat. One is the \"degree of\r\nelectrification,\" the other, \"the degree of hotness.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207.--Air pressure apparatus to illustrate\r\nelectrical pressure.]\r\n\r\n=229. Electrical pressure= is a term sometimes used for difference of\r\npotential. To better understand electrical pressure consider three round\r\ntanks (Fig. 207) containing air. _A_ is a tank holding air at 10 lbs.\r\npressure per square inch, above atmospheric pressure, _B_ is open to the\r\nair and hence is at atmospheric pressure while _C_ has a partial vacuum,\r\nwith 10 lbs. less pressure than that of the atmosphere. If the valve at\r\n_D_ or _E_ is opened a flow of air sets up until the pressures are\r\nequalized. While if the pump at _P_ is working a difference in pressure\r\nis easily maintained. Tank _A_ corresponds to an insulated body charged\r\nto a high _positive_ potential; tank _B_, open to the air, a body\r\nconnected to the earth; while tank _C_ represents a body having a\r\n_negative_ potential. The earth is said to have _zero potential_.\r\n\r\nNow just as compressed air will be pushed into the atmosphere (as from\r\n_A_ to _B_) while air at atmospheric pressure will if possible be forced\r\nitself into a partial vacuum (as from _B_ to _C_), so electricity at a\r\npositive potential will tend to move to a place at zero potential, while\r\nthat at zero potential tends to move to a place of negative potential.\r\nBodies at the _same_ potential as the earth, or at zero potential, are\r\nalso said to be _neutral_. Those positively electrified have a positive\r\npotential, those negatively electrified have a negative potential. As in\r\ngases, movement always tends from higher pressure (potential) to lower\r\npressure (potential).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208.--The metal plate gives the electroscope a\r\ngreater surface and hence greater capacity.]\r\n\r\n=230. Capacity.=--If we have a 100-gallon tank and a 10-gallon tank\r\nconnected by a pipe both filled with compressed air, the larger tank\r\nwill contain ten times as much air as the smaller at the _same pressure_\r\nsince it has ten times the capacity, or, if the two tanks are separated\r\nand the same amount of air is contained in each, the pressure of the air\r\ncontained in the small tank will be ten times that in the large one.\r\n\r\nThe _electrical capacity_ of a conductor is in some respects similar to\r\nthe capacity of a tank for air. Since, however, electrical charges are\r\nupon the surface of a body, its capacity depends in part upon the extent\r\nof surface. For example, if a charge is taken from a charged rubber rod\r\nby a proof plane to an electroscope a certain divergence of the leaves\r\nwill be noticed. If a circular metal plate several times the diameter of\r\nthe top of the electroscope is laid upon the latter (see Fig. 208), and\r\na charge equal to that used before is brought to the electroscope, the\r\nleaves show less divergence than before, showing that the _same charge\r\ngives a lower potential when placed upon a body of greater capacity_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209.--A plate condenser.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210.--A condenser of several plates.]\r\n\r\n=231. The electric condenser= is a device having a large electrical\r\ncapacity consisting of parallel conductors separated by good insulators.\r\nIt has been devised to enable one to obtain a large electrical charge\r\nupon a body of convenient size. Such an apparatus is of great practical\r\nvalue in many experiments and operations. Its construction involves the\r\nprinciple of electrostatic induction in which a charge of one kind\r\nattracts and \"holds\" strongly a charge of opposite kind near it. In its\r\nsimplest form it consists of two parallel conductors separated from each\r\nother (Fig. 209). The upper plate has been charged negatively. This has\r\ngiven the lower plate a positive charge by induction, since the latter\r\nis connected to the earth. These positive and negative charges hold or\r\n\"bind\" each other so that a large quantity may be accumulated. To\r\nincrease the capacity of a condenser, several plates are used connected\r\nas in Fig. 210.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the kind of insulator between the charged\r\nconductors of a condenser affects its capacity. Thus if glass,\r\nparaffine, or beeswax is between the plates instead of air, the plates\r\nwill \"hold\" more electricity at the same potential. For this reason\r\ncondenser plates are often separated by sheets of glass, paraffined\r\npaper, or mica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211.--A Leyden jar and a discharger.]\r\n\r\n=232. The Leyden Jar.=--A convenient form of condenser, used as long ago\r\nas 1745, is the Leyden jar. It consists of a glass jar (Fig. 211) coated\r\npart way up, inside and out, with tinfoil. The inner coating is\r\nconnected by a chain to a knob at the top. The Leyden jar is charged by\r\nconnecting the outer coating to the earth while to the inner coating is\r\ngiven a charge of either kind of electricity. The other kind of charge\r\nis developed by induction upon the outer coating, and each charge binds\r\nthe other. To discharge a jar, a conductor, as a wire, is connected\r\nfirst to the outer coating and held there while the other end is brought\r\nto the knob at the top. A bright spark is produced when the two charges\r\ncombine. It is best not to let the discharge from the jar pass through\r\nthe body unless one is certain that only a very small charge is present.\r\n\r\n=233. Oscillatory Discharge.=--The discharge from a Leyden jar is an\r\ninteresting phenomenon. The rush of electricity from one coat to the\r\nother does not stop when the two coats are exactly neutralized but\r\ncontinues until the two plates are charged just oppositely to their\r\ncondition at first, then a rush of electricity in the opposite direction\r\noccurs. This alternation continues several times and constitutes what is\r\ncalled the _oscillatory discharge_. (See Fig. 414.) This oscillatory\r\ndischarge sets up waves in the ether. These are called _Hertzian_ waves\r\nin honor of their discoverer, Heinrich Hertz. They are the ether waves\r\nused in wireless telegraphy. A _lightning flash_ has been shown by\r\nphotographs and by other means to be oscillatory. This fact supports the\r\nidea that the electrical conditions just preceding the stroke of\r\nlightning reproduce a condenser on a large scale. The charged cloud is\r\nthe upper charged plate, the earth beneath, charged by induction from\r\nthe cloud, is the lower charged plate, while the air between is the\r\ninsulator or _dielectric_ as it is sometimes called.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) ELECTROSTATIC GENERATORS\r\n\r\n=234. Static Electric Machines.=--Many machines have been invented to\r\nproduce larger quantities of static electricity than we have used in the\r\nexperiments previously described. One of the earlier of these was the\r\n_plate friction machine_ in which a large circular glass plate was\r\nrotated while a pad of some material was held against it. This machine\r\nwas capable of producing powerful effects, but it took much work to\r\nturn it, and it has been abandoned for a more efficient device, the\r\n_static induction machine_.\r\n\r\n=235. The electrophorus= is the simplest static induction generator,\r\nconsisting simply of a flat circular plate of some insulating material,\r\nas paraffine, shellac, or rosin contained in a metal pan, and a flat\r\ncircular metal _disc_ having an insulating handle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 212.--An electrophorus.]\r\n\r\n_The electrophorus is used as follows_: The plate is first electrified\r\nby rubbing or beating with fur or a woolen cloth. The plate will be\r\nfound to be charged negatively. The metal disc is placed upon the plate\r\nby holding the insulating handle. The upper surface of the charged body\r\nis slightly uneven so that the disc touches but a few high points. The\r\ngreater part of the charged surface is separated from the metal disc by\r\nair, a good insulator. The charge therefore acts inductively upon the\r\ndisc _repelling negative_ electricity to the upper surface of the disc,\r\nleaving the lower surface charged positively (Fig. 212). If now the\r\nfinger is touched to the disc the repelled negative charge escapes and\r\nthe whole disc is left positively charged. The disc is now removed (Fig.\r\n213) and the charge upon it may be tested or used in any desired manner.\r\nThe disc may be recharged many times without rubbing the plate again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213.--Electrophorus charged.]\r\n\r\nThese electrical charges possess _energy_. What is the source of this\r\nenergy? The answer may be determined by the following experiment. Place\r\nthe disc upon the charged plate. Touch the disc with the finger to\r\nremove the repelled charge. Connect an electroscope to the disc by a\r\nfine wire. Nothing appears on the electroscope, since the disc has been\r\nconnected to the earth, and is therefore at zero potential. If now the\r\ndisc is lifted slowly, the leaves of the electroscope gradually\r\nseparate, showing that a charge of electricity appears when the disc is\r\nbeing lifted against the force of attraction between the two charges.\r\nJust as potential energy is developed in a weight when it is lifted\r\nagainst the earth's attraction so electrical energy appears in the disc\r\nwhile it is being separated from the plate. The electrical energy of the\r\ncharge is therefore due to the work done in separating the two charges.\r\nThis electrical energy appears as heat and light, when the disc is\r\ndischarged. It may be employed to ignite gas, gunpowder, etc.\r\n\r\n=236. The Toepler-Holtz Induction Machine.=--This is a type of induction\r\nor influence machine that is often used for producing a continuous\r\nsupply of electricity as in the operation of \"X\" ray machines, in\r\nlecture demonstrations, etc. This machine (Fig. 214) consists of two\r\ndiscs: one fixed, the other mounted so as to revolve. Upon the back of\r\nthe fixed plate are two sectors of tinfoil which become charged\r\noppositely. Upon the revolving plate are six metallic discs. These discs\r\nact like the discs of the electrophorus. They become charged by\r\ninduction from the charges upon the sectors fastened to the fixed plate.\r\nThe brushes held by a rod touch the discs at just the right time to take\r\noff the repelled charge. The charges induced upon the discs are taken\r\noff by two metal combs whose points are held close to the revolving\r\ndisc. The Leyden jars assist in accumulating a good strong charge\r\nbefore a spark passes between the terminal knobs. Some machines are\r\nbuilt up of several pairs of plates and give correspondingly large\r\namounts of electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 214.--The Toepler-Holtz induction machine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n_Static Electric Generators._--(a) plate friction machine, (b)\r\nelectrophorus, (c) induction or influence machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1.

Sources of Electric Currents.=--In studying the production and\r\ndistribution of static electricity it was seen that if two bodies at\r\n_different potentials_ are connected by a copper wire a _movement of\r\nelectricity to the body_ having the _lower potential_ occurred along the\r\nconducting wire. This movement of electricity is called an _electric\r\ncurrent_ (Art. 227). _A difference of potential_ is therefore often\r\ncalled an _electromotive force_ (E.M.F.), since it produces the movement\r\nof electricity in a conductor. The current between two _oppositely\r\ncharged_ bodies lasts for so short a time as to be of little or no\r\npractical value unless some means are found for continually recharging\r\nthe bodies. That is, some device must be used to restore the difference\r\nin potential as fast as the conducting wire equalizes it. The continual\r\ncharging of the bodies takes work. In other words, it requires a\r\ncontinual expenditure of some form of energy (which is converted into\r\nelectrical energy) to produce the electric current. Two forms of energy\r\nare commonly used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n(A) _Chemical energy_ is employed in _voltaic cells_ for producing\r\nelectric currents. (B) _Mechanical energy_ is used for the same purpose\r\nin the _dynamo_ and similar devices.\r\n\r\n=238. The voltaic cell= is named after Volta, an Italian physicist, who\r\nin 1800 invented it. In its simplest form it consists of a strip of\r\ncopper and a strip of zinc placed in dilute sulphuric acid (one part\r\nacid to fifteen or twenty of water) (Fig. 215). By the use of sensitive\r\napparatus, it can be shown that the copper plate of the voltaic cell has\r\na positive charge and the zinc plate a negative charge. For example, let\r\na flat plate 10 cm. in diameter be placed upon the knob of an\r\nelectroscope and a similar plate, coated with shellac and provided with\r\nan insulating handle, be set upon it to form a condenser. (See Fig.\r\n216.) If now wires from the two plates of a simple voltaic cell be\r\nrespectively connected to the plates of the condenser, charges from the\r\ncopper and zinc plates will accumulate upon the two condenser plates.\r\nNow remove the wires and lift the upper plate. The \"bound\" charge upon\r\nthe lower plate will spread over the leaves and cause them to separate.\r\nUpon testing, the charge from the zinc plate will be found to be\r\n_negative_ and that from the copper plate, _positive_. Since a positive\r\ncharge is found upon the copper plate it is called the _positive\r\nelectrode_; the zinc plate is called the _negative electrode_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215.--Cross-section of a simple voltaic cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216.--Testing the charges upon the plates of a\r\nsimple voltaic cell.]\r\n\r\n=239. Test for an Electric Current.=--If the copper and zinc plates of a\r\nvoltaic cell are connected by a wire, a current of electricity is set\r\nup in the conductor. Evidence of the current may be obtained by holding\r\nthe conducting wire over and parallel to the needle of a magnetoscope.\r\nThe needle is deflected by the action of the current parallel to it\r\n(Fig. 217). This _magnetic effect_ of a current is the means usually\r\nemployed for the _detection_ and _measurement_ of an electric current.\r\nSuch a device which detects an electric current by its _magnetic effect\r\nis called a galvanoscope_, in honor of Galvani, who in 1786 was the\r\nfirst to discover how to produce an electric current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217.--The magnetic needle is deflected by the\r\ncurrent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218.--Diagram of an electric bell circuit.]\r\n\r\n=240. The Electric Circuit.=--_The entire conducting path along which a\r\ncurrent of electricity flows is called an electric circuit._ In the case\r\nof a voltaic cell, the circuit includes not only the wires connecting\r\nthe plates but also the plates themselves and the liquid between them.\r\nWhen some device or apparatus is to receive current from the cell, it is\r\nattached to the plates and wires so that the device is a part of the\r\nelectric circuit. Separating the circuit at any point is called\r\n_breaking_ or _opening_ the circuit, while connecting the ends of an\r\nopen circuit is called _making_ or _closing_ the circuit. A device for\r\nopening and closing a circuit is called a _key_ or _switch_. The\r\nelectric circuit used in ringing a door bell is familiar to most boys\r\nand girls. This circuit is _open_ most of the time. It is closed by\r\npressing the _push-button_ at the door, and the flow of current through\r\nthe _electric bell_ causes the latter to ring. Such a circuit is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 218. Here _C_ is the voltaic cell, the two lines\r\nrepresenting the plates of the cell. A cross-section view of the\r\npush-button (_P_), shows how the circuit is closed, (_B_) is the bell.\r\nWherever current electricity is used the device in which it is employed\r\nforms a part of an electric circuit extending back to some electric\r\ngenerator. This generator must be able to continually produce an E.M.F.,\r\nor a difference of potential between its terminals, in order that the\r\nmovement of electricity may be continuous.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n(a) Electric generators: (1) voltaic cell uses chemical energy; (2)\r\ndynamo uses mechanical energy.\r\n\r\n(b) Electric circuits: (1) open, (2) closed, (3) key and switch.\r\n\r\n(c) Voltaic and galvanic electricity (names).\r\n\r\n(d) Galvanoscope, uses.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1.

Represent some other electric circuit, naming the generator and other\r\ndevices in the circuit.\r\n\r\n4. Look up the work of Volta and Galvani and write a statement of the\r\nelectrical discoveries and inventions made by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) THE VOLTAIC CELL AND ITS ACTION\r\n\r\n=241. The simple voltaic cell= consists of a strip of copper and a strip\r\nof zinc placed in dilute sulphuric acid. (See Fig. 219.) A short time\r\nafter placing the plates in the acid, bubbles of a gas (hydrogen) appear\r\non the surface of the zinc. These bubbles increase in size and some rise\r\nto the surface of the liquid. Nothing appears upon the copper plate. If\r\nthe tops of the plates are connected by a wire, an electric current is\r\nset up through the wire and the cell, and bubbles of gas also appear\r\nupon the _copper_ as well as on the zinc. In a short time the surface of\r\nthe copper becomes coated with bubbles and the current becomes much\r\n_weaker_. If the plates are left in the acid for some time the zinc is\r\nfound to be eaten away, having been dissolved in the acid through\r\nchemical action. The copper, however, remains practically unaffected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219.--A simple voltaic cell.]\r\n\r\n=242. How the Current is Produced.=--To maintain the electric current a\r\ncontinual supply of energy is required. This is furnished by the\r\n_chemical action_ of the acid upon the zinc. The chemical action is in\r\nseveral respects like _combustion_ or _burning_, by means of which\r\nchemical energy is transformed into heat energy. In the voltaic cell the\r\nchemical action of the acid upon the zinc _transforms_ chemical energy\r\ninto electrical energy. The E.M.F. or _difference of potential_ may be\r\nconsidered as originating at the surface of the zinc where the chemical\r\naction takes place. At this point the zinc has the lower and the liquid\r\nin contact with it the higher potential. The molecules of the acid are\r\nbelieved to be separated or broken up into two parts called _ions_; one\r\nion, the SO_{4} or _sulphion_, combines with the zinc forming zinc\r\nsulphate, the other, or hydrogen (H) ion, passes over to the copper\r\nplate, and accumulates on the surface of this plate giving it a positive\r\ncharge. It is therefore called the _positive ion_. The sulphion ion, or\r\nSO_{4} ion, carries a negative charge to the zinc. It is therefore\r\ncalled the _negative ion_.\r\n\r\n=243. The Direction of the Current.=[K]--Beginning at the surface of the\r\nzinc the _direction_ of the movement of _positive_ electricity may be\r\ntraced through the liquid to the copper plate, to the wire, to the zinc\r\nplate, to the starting point, thus completing the electric circuit. When\r\nthe circuit is closed it is found that the movement of electricity\r\nstarts in _all_ parts of the circuit at practically _the same instant_.\r\n\r\n  [K] Many scientists consider that current in a conductor consists\r\n  of _negative electrons_ flowing in a direction _opposite_ to that\r\n  described in Art. 243. This is called the _electron current_, as\r\n  distinguished from the _electric current_ described above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 220.--A comparison of a voltaic cell and circuit to\r\na water pump and connecting pipes.]\r\n\r\n=244. The production of the current= may be illustrated by describing a\r\ndevice for producing a continuous circulation of water. Thus let _Cu_\r\nand _Zn_ represent two pipes connected by two horizontal tubes, one at\r\n_V_ provided with a valve and one at _P_ with a rotary _Pump_. (See Fig.\r\n220.) Suppose the pipes filled to the level of _V_ and the pump started.\r\nThe pump will force water from _Zn_ to _Cu_, through _P_, the level\r\nfalling in _Zn_ and rising in _Cu_. If the valve _V_ is open the water\r\nwill flow back through _V_ as long as the pump is working. If _V_ is\r\nclosed, the level in _Cu_ will rise as high as the driving force of the\r\npump can send it. If now _V_ is opened, the pump will maintain the water\r\nin circulation from _Cu_ to _Zn_ through _V_. In the illustration, the\r\ntubes _Cu_ and _Zn_ correspond to the conducting plates of _copper_ and\r\n_zinc_ of a voltaic cell. The pump _P_ represents the chemical action\r\nwhich produces the electrical pressure. The upper pipe represents the\r\npart of the circuit outside of the cell, the valve _V_ corresponds to an\r\nelectric key or switch which is used to open and close the electric\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\n=245. Polarization.=--In the simple voltaic cell, after the circuit is\r\nclosed, bubbles of hydrogen collect upon the copper plate. This\r\naccumulation of hydrogen gas is called _polarization_. It acts as a\r\nnon-conducting layer upon the surface of the plate and seriously\r\ninterferes with the movement of electricity from the liquid to the\r\ncopper plate not only in the simple voltaic cell but in many others as\r\nwell. Some voltaic cells are made entirely free from this defect, either\r\n(a) _by the removal of the hydrogen as fast as it is formed_, or (b) _by\r\nthe use of such chemicals that no hydrogen is produced_.\r\n\r\n=246. Local Action.=--It is noticed that when a strip of zinc is placed\r\nin dilute acid that bubbles appear upon the surface of the zinc. The\r\nappearance of these bubbles indicates that some of the hydrogen ions\r\ncarrying positive electricity have moved to the zinc plate. Careful\r\nexamination of the plate after it has been in acid shows numerous black\r\nspots upon it. These are bits of carbon. They are always found in\r\nordinary zinc. Small electric currents are set up which run from\r\nmolecules of pure zinc into the liquid and back to the carbon particles,\r\nthus forming small closed circuits. (See Fig. 221.) The formation of\r\nthese circuits from and to the zinc is called _local_ action. This\r\naction is a defect in voltaic cells since a part of the current is thus\r\nkept from passing through the main outside circuit, and the zinc may be\r\nconsumed even when no outside current is flowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221.--Local action.]\r\n\r\n=247. Amalgamation.=--Local action is prevented by coating the zinc with\r\nmercury. This process is called _amalgamation_. The mercury covers the\r\nentire surface of the plate in the acid. Its action is to dissolve pure\r\nzinc and bring it to the outer surface where it is acted upon by the\r\nacid. The carbon particles are kept covered so that no local currents\r\ncan be formed as long as the bits of carbon are below the surface.\r\nAmalgamation therefore prevents local action.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n_The Simple Voltaic Cell_\r\n\r\n1.

Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) PRACTICAL VOLTAIC CELLS\r\n\r\n=248. Advantages of Voltaic Cells.=--Many forms of voltaic cells have\r\nbeen devised. Several of the more common of these will be described and\r\ntheir electro-chemical action explained.\r\n\r\nAt the present time voltaic cells are employed only where small currents\r\nare needed, such as for electric bells and induction coils. Where more\r\nthan a small amount of current is required, the dynamo and the storage\r\nbattery have generally taken their place as sources of electric current.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of voltaic cells as electric generators are: (a) they are\r\ninexpensive, (b) they are easily taken from place to place, (c) they may\r\nbe ready for instant use.\r\n\r\nThe most desirable voltaic cell would be one having the following\r\nqualities: (a) High electromotive force, (b) no polarization or local\r\naction, (c) very low internal resistance, (d) small expense, both as to\r\nfirst cost and upkeep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 222.--The Leclanché cell, \"wet\" type.]\r\n\r\n=249. The Leclanché cell= is the one commonly used for ringing door\r\nbells. It has two plates: one of zinc and the other of _carbon_. These\r\nare placed in a solution of sal ammoniac (Fig. 222). Take up the\r\ndesirable qualities mentioned at the end of the preceding paragraph. (a)\r\nIt may be shown that this cell has a good E.M.F. about 1.5 volts. (b) It\r\n_polarizes_ easily yet it recovers well when left upon open circuit.\r\nUsually a substance called manganese dioxide is mixed with the carbon.\r\nThis acts as a _depolarizer_, that is, it combines with the hydrogen to\r\nform water. (c) Its resistance varies and is often considerable. (d) The\r\nexpense for upkeep is small, since a 5-cent rod of zinc, and a 5-cent\r\ncharge of sal ammoniac will keep the cell in action on a bell circuit\r\nfrom six months to a year or more. It is well suited for use on _open\r\ncircuits_ that is, where the circuit is open the greater part of the\r\ntime and is closed only occasionally; as in ringing door bells,\r\noperating telephones, and other devices whose circuits are usually open.\r\n\r\n=250. The Dry Cell.=--Many forms of Leclanché cells are made. One of\r\nthese is called the _dry cell_ (See Fig. 223.) In this cell the zinc\r\nplate is made into a jar or can and contains the other materials. At the\r\ncenter of the cell is a rod of carbon and manganese dioxide. The space\r\nbetween the carbon and zinc is filled with a porous material such as\r\nsawdust or plaster of Paris. A strong solution of sal ammoniac fills the\r\nporous material. The top of the cell is sealed with pitch or wax to\r\nprevent evaporation. The great advantage of this cell is that it may be\r\nused or carried in any position without danger of spilling its contents.\r\nDry cells are often used to operate the spark coils of gas and gasoline\r\nengines. The Leclanché cell described in Art. 249 is commonly known as\r\nthe \"wet cell.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 223.--The Leclanché cell, \"dry\" type.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 224.--The Daniell cell.]\r\n\r\n=251. The Daniell Cell.=--This cell is often used in laboratories, and\r\non closed circuits such as those connected with fire and burglar alarms\r\nand telegraph lines. It has two plates of zinc and copper placed in two\r\ndifferent liquids which are kept separated by a porous clay cup (Fig.\r\n224). The zinc rod is kept in a solution of zinc sulphate contained in\r\nthe porous cup. The copper plate is in a solution of copper sulphate\r\nfilling the rest of the glass jar. Unlike the Leclanché cell, this one\r\nmust be kept upon a _closed circuit_ to do its best work, as the two\r\nliquids mix when the circuit is open. Taking its qualities in order, (a)\r\nits E.M.F. is about one volt, (b) it has no polarization since copper\r\ninstead of hydrogen is deposited upon the copper plate. Therefore a\r\nuniform E.M.F. may be obtained from it, making it especially useful in\r\nlaboratory experiments and tests. (c) Its resistance is considerable and\r\n(d) it is more expensive to operate than the Leclanché. It is sometimes\r\nused upon closed circuits outside of laboratories as in burglar and\r\nfire alarms, although in recent years, the storage battery is taking its\r\nplace for these purposes.\r\n\r\n=252. The Gravity Cell.=--Fig. 225 is like the Daniell cell in most\r\nrespects, except that in this cell, the zinc plate is held at the top of\r\nthe jar in a solution of zinc sulphate while the copper plate is at the\r\nbottom, surrounded by a solution of copper sulphate. The solutions mix\r\nbut slowly as the copper sulphate solution is denser and remains at the\r\nbottom. This cell like the Daniell must also be kept upon closed\r\ncircuit. On account of its simplicity and economy it is often used to\r\noperate telegraph instruments. Its qualities are similar to those of the\r\nDaniell cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225.--The gravity cell.]\r\n\r\n=253. Symbol for Voltaic Cells.=--In electrical diagrams, the symbol\r\nemployed to represent a voltaic cell is a short thick line near to and\r\nparallel to a longer thin one. As in Fig. 226. If several cells are to\r\nbe represented the conventional symbol of the combination is represented\r\nas in Fig. 227. A single cell and a group of cells are each frequently\r\ncalled a battery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 226.--Diagram of a single cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 227.--Diagram of a group of cells.]\r\n\r\n=254. Effects of Electric Currents.=--Having studied some of the devices\r\nfor producing an electric current, let us now consider some of the\r\n_effects_ caused by it. These effects will be studied under three heads:\r\n(a) _Magnetic_, (b) _Chemical_, and (c) _Heat_ effects. Devices or\r\narticles showing these effects known to most high school students are\r\nrespectively: (a) the _electromagnet_ (b) _electro-plated silver ware_\r\nand (c) _electric heaters_, such as electric flat irons, electric\r\ntoasters, etc. The _magnetic_ effect of an electric current was first\r\ndetected by Oersted at the University of Copenhagen in 1819. It may be\r\nobserved by holding a wire carrying a current from a voltaic cell above\r\nand _parallel_ to the needle of a _magnetoscope_. The needle is at once\r\ndeflected (Fig. 228). If the current is reversed in direction the\r\nmagnetoscope needle is deflected in the reverse direction. This simple\r\ndevice is the most common means for detecting an electric current. It\r\ntherefore constitutes a _galvanoscope_. (See Art. 239.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228.--A galvanoscope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) THE MAGNETIC EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTS\r\n\r\n=255. The Magnetic Effect.=--Of all the effects of electric currents, it\r\nis generally conceded that the _magnetic effect_ is the one of _greatest\r\npractical importance_, and it is also the one most extensively used. An\r\nexperiment illustrating this effect has been described in Art. 239. This\r\nexperiment shows that an electric current, if _parallel_ to a magnetic\r\nneedle, and _near it_ will deflect the north-seeking pole of the needle\r\nto the right or left depending upon the _direction_ of the current flow.\r\nThis _deflection_ of the magnetic needle is due to the fact that\r\nsurrounding every electric current are magnetic lines of force. It is\r\nthis magnetic field of the current that causes the needle to turn. The\r\nposition taken by the needle is the resultant of the forces of two\r\nmagnetic fields; one, the earth's field, the other, that of the current.\r\n\r\n=256. Right-hand Rule for a Conductor.=--To show the presence of the\r\nmagnetic field about a current, pass a thick copper wire vertically\r\nthrough a sheet of paper, and connect the ends of the wire to a source\r\nof current. While the current (this should be as much as 10 amperes if\r\npossible) is flowing, sprinkle iron filings upon the paper and tap\r\ngently. The filings will arrange themselves in circles about the wire\r\nshowing the magnetic field. (See Fig. 229.) The needle of a magnetoscope\r\ntends to place itself parallel to the lines of force of this field and\r\nfrom this action or tendency the _direction_ of the magnetic lines\r\nabout a current may be determined. The following rule is helpful and\r\nshould be memorized: _Grasp the conductor with the right hand with the\r\noutstretched thumb in the direction that the current is flowing. The\r\nfingers will then encircle the wire in the direction of the lines of\r\nforce._ This rule may be reversed, for, if the fingers of the right hand\r\ngrasp the wire so as to point with the magnetic field, then the current\r\nflows in the direction in which the thumb points. (See Fig. 230.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229.--Magnetic field about a wire carrying an\r\nelectric current.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230.--Right-hand rule for the magnetic field of a\r\ncurrent.]\r\n\r\n=257. Magnetic Field of a Helix.=--If a wire be wound about a cylinder\r\nto form a cylindrical coil with parallel turns, it forms a _helix_ or\r\n_solenoid_. The shape of the magnetic field about a current depends upon\r\nthe _form_ of the conductor. If the latter is in the form of a _helix_\r\nits magnetic field resembles that of a straight bar magnet. (See Fig.\r\n231). In fact the helix _has the properties of a magnet_ with north- and\r\nsouth-seeking poles while a _current_ is _flowing_ through it. If such a\r\ncoil is suspended so as to turn freely, it tends to turn until the field\r\nwithin it is parallel to the earth's magnetic field. Such a suspended\r\nhelix may therefore be used as a compass. In order to strengthen the\r\nmagnetic field of a helix or solenoid, the space within its turns is\r\nfilled with iron, often in the form of small soft-iron wires. This\r\nbundle of iron wire is called the _core_ of the helix. The core becomes\r\nstrongly magnetized by the field of the helix while the current is\r\nflowing and quickly loses its magnetic force when the current is\r\nstopped. _The direction of the current in a helix_ (Fig. 232) or the\r\n_polarity_ of its core may be determined by another _right-hand rule_.\r\n_If the helix is grasped with the right hand so that the fingers point\r\nin the direction in which the current is flowing, the extended thumb\r\nwill point in the direction of the north pole of the helix._ On the\r\nother hand, if the poles of the helix are known, then, when the helix is\r\ngrasped with the right hand so that the thumb points to the\r\nnorth-seeking pole, the current is flowing in the wires in the direction\r\nthat the fingers point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.--The magnetic field of a helix.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232.--Right-hand rule for a helix.]\r\n\r\n=258. The Electromagnet.=--These \"right-hand\" rules are applied in many\r\ndifferent devices. Among these, perhaps the most important is the\r\nelectromagnet, which is used in the electric bell, the telegraph, the\r\ntelephone, the dynamo, the motor, and many other electric contrivances.\r\n\r\nThe electromagnet is defined as a _mass of iron around which is placed a\r\nhelix for conducting an electric current_. On account of its large\r\npermeability, the iron core of the helix adds greatly to the\r\neffectiveness of the electromagnet, since the magnetism of the iron is\r\nadded to that of the current in the helix. The magnetism remaining in\r\nthe iron after the current stops is called the _residual_ magnetism. The\r\nresidual magnetism is small when the core is made of small wires or thin\r\nplates, but is larger when the iron core is solid. Like artificial steel\r\nmagnets, electromagnets are usually of two forms, _bar_ and _horseshoe_.\r\n(See Figs. 233 and 234.) For most purposes the horseshoe form is the\r\nmore effective since it permits a complete iron circuit for the magnetic\r\nlines of force. (See Fig. 235.) This is the form used in the electric\r\nbell, in the telegraph sounder, and in lifting magnets. (See Fig. 236.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233.--A bar electromagnet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234.--A horseshoe electromagnet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235.--A horseshoe electromagnet may have a complete\r\niron circuit for its lines of force.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236.--A lifting magnet.]\r\n\r\n=259. Effective Electromagnets.=--The _magnetic_ effect of a current in\r\na helix is small, hence the force usually is increased by inserting a\r\ncore of iron. When at first man tried to signal with electromagnets at\r\na distance it was found that the current would not work the\r\nelectromagnet. An American by the name of Joseph Henry discovered the\r\nremedy for this condition. He found that if the copper wire was\r\ninsulated by wrapping silk thread about it, and then many layers of the\r\nsilk insulated wire were wound upon a spool with an iron core, that the\r\nmagnet would work at a great distance from the source of current. If the\r\ncurrent is increased, the magnet is stronger than at first. Thus an\r\n_electromagnet may be made stronger by_ (a) _increasing the number of\r\nturns of wire in its coils_ and by (b) _sending a stronger current\r\nthrough it_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237.--A simple telegraph circuit.]\r\n\r\n=260. The Telegraph.=--The invention of an effective electromagnet by\r\nHenry made possible the _electric telegraph_. In its simplest form it\r\nconsists of a battery, _C_, a key, _K_, and a sounder, _S_, with\r\nconnecting wires. (See Fig. 237.) The _sounder_ (Fig. 238) contains a\r\n_horseshoe electromagnet_ and a bar of soft iron across its poles called\r\nan armature, _A_, attached to a lever _L_. When the key is closed, the\r\nelectromagnet draws down the armature and lever until the latter hits a\r\nstop _O_, making a click. When the key is raised, the magnet releases\r\nthe armature which is raised by the action of a spring at _S_ until the\r\nlever hits a stop at _T_ making another click. Closing and opening the\r\ncircuit at _K_ will start and stop the current which operates _S_ which\r\nmay be 100 miles or more from _K_. One voltaic cell will work a sounder\r\nin the same room. But if many miles of wire are in the circuit, the\r\nE.M.F. of a single cell will not force sufficient current through the\r\nlong wire to operate the sounder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 238.--A telegraph sounder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 239.--A telegraph relay.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 240.--How the relay is used.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samuel F. B. Morse (1791-1872). Inventor of the\r\nelectromagnetic recording telegraph and of the dot and dash alphabet.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL F. B.

EDISON\r\n\r\n\"Copyright, Photographische Gessellschaft,\" and \"By Permission of the\r\nBerlin Photographic Co., New York.\"]\r\n\r\nA battery of several cells is then required. Even a large battery is\r\ninsufficient to operate a long line containing many sounders in circuit.\r\nRecourse is therefore usually made to a more sensitive device called a\r\n_relay_. (See Fig. 239.) In the relay a very small current will\r\nmagnetize its electromagnet enough to draw toward it the delicately hung\r\narmature thereby closing a second circuit which contains a sounder and a\r\nbattery. (See Fig. 240.) when the current in the main circuit is\r\nstopped, the armature of the relay is drawn back by a light spring. This\r\nopens the _local_ circuit. Thus the local circuit is closed and opened\r\nby the relay just in time with the starting and stopping of the current\r\nin the main line. It is thus possible for a small current in the main\r\nline by the use of a relay, to close and open a second local circuit\r\ncontaining a local battery and sounder. Modern telegraph lines are\r\noperated in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 241.--An electric bell and its circuit.]\r\n\r\n=261. The electric bell= (see Fig. 241), consists of an electromagnet,\r\n_M_, a soft iron _armature_, _A_, attached to the _tapper_, _T_, and a\r\npost, _R_. When no current is flowing a spring at _S_ holds the armature\r\nagainst the post _R_. When current flows through the helix, its core\r\nbecomes magnetized and attracts the armature, drawing it away from the\r\npost, _R_, and causing the tapper to hit the bell. Drawing _A_ away from\r\nthe post, however, breaks the circuit at _R_ and the current stops. The\r\nmagnetism in the core disappears releasing the armature, which is then\r\npulled back by the spring _S_ against the post _R_. This completes the\r\ncircuit and the process repeats itself several times a second as long as\r\nthe current flows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 242.--Magnetizing by the discharge of a Leyden jar.]\r\n\r\n=262. Static and Current Electricity Compared.=--The likeness between a\r\ndischarge of static electricity and an electric current may be shown by\r\nwinding a coil of insulated wire about a glass tube which contains a\r\nsteel needle. If a Leyden jar (see Fig. 242) is discharged through the\r\ncoil the steel needle is usually found to be magnetized, showing that\r\nthe discharge of the static electricity has a magnetic effect similar to\r\nthat of an electric current. Sometimes a given end of the needle has a\r\nnorth pole and at other times a south pole. This is believed to\r\nindicate that the charge of the Leyden jar is _oscillatory_, and that\r\nin different discharges sometimes a surge in one direction and at other\r\ntimes a surge in the reverse direction has been most effective in\r\nmagnetizing the needle. Compare this action with that described in Art.\r\n233.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Right-hand rules, for conductor, for helix.\r\n\r\n2. The electromagnet, two forms, where used?\r\n\r\n3.

A helix is placed horizontally with its north-seeking pole toward the\r\nnorth. Does the current in the wire at the top of the helix move east or\r\nwest? Explain.\r\n\r\n8. State at least six conditions any one of which will put an electric\r\nbell circuit out of commission.\r\n\r\n9. If one desires to insert a battery into a telegraph circuit already\r\nin operation, how will he determine the direction of the current in the\r\nwire?\r\n\r\n10. If a boy who had magnetized his knife blade in a physics laboratory,\r\npointed end south-seeking, should lose his way in the woods on a cloudy\r\nday, how could he determine his way out?\r\n\r\n11. At a certain point the earth's field acts north, that of an electric\r\ncurrent, east. The magnetoscope needle points exactly northeast when\r\nplaced at that point. How do the two magnetic fields compare?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS\r\n\r\n=263. Galvanometers.=--In using electric currents it is often necessary\r\nor desirable to be able to know not only that a given current is weak or\r\nstrong, but precisely what its strength is. We can determine the\r\nrelative strengths of two currents by the use of a _galvanometer_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 243.--The magnet is at the center of the coil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 244.--A moving-magnet (tangent) galvanometer.]\r\n\r\nThe older or _moving-magnet_ type of galvanometer is similar to the\r\ngalvanoscope mentioned in Art. 239. It consists of a magnetic needle\r\nmounted at the center of a coil of wire. The coil is placed facing east\r\nand west, so that the needle will be held by the earth's magnetic field\r\nparallel to the plane of the coil. When a current is sent through the\r\ncoil a magnetic field is produced within it. This deflects the needle,\r\nits north end turning east or west depending upon the direction of the\r\ncurrent. (See Fig. 243.) The _coils_ of a moving-magnet or _tangent_\r\ngalvanometer (see Fig. 244) are _large_ and firmly fastened to the base,\r\nwhile the _magnet_ is _small_.\r\n\r\nThe _moving-coil_ type of galvanometer (see Fig. 245) consists of a\r\n_large magnet_ fastened to the frame of the device. The magnet usually\r\nhas a horseshoe form to produce as strong a field as possible. The\r\n_coil_ is wound on a _light_ rectangular frame and is suspended between\r\nthe two poles of the magnet. To concentrate the magnetic field, a\r\ncylinder of soft iron is usually placed within the coil. Fig. 246\r\nrepresents a common form of moving-coil galvanometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 245.--To illustrate the principle of the moving-coil\r\ngalvanometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 246.--A moving-coil (D'Arsonval) galvanometer.]\r\n\r\n=264. Measurement of Electric Currents.=--A galvanometer enables one to\r\n_compare_ electric currents. To _measure_ electric currents it is\r\nnecessary to employ a _unit_ of electrical quantity, just as in\r\nmeasuring the quantity of water delivered by a pipe, a unit of liquid\r\nmeasure is employed; thus, _e.g._, the current delivered by a given pipe\r\nmay be 2 gallons of water per second, so in measuring the flow of an\r\nelectric current one may speak of two _coulombs_ per second. The\r\n_coulomb_ is the unit quantity of electricity just as the unit of\r\nquantity of water is the gallon.\r\n\r\nFor most practical purposes, however, we are more interested in the\r\n_rate_ or _intensity_ of flow of current than in the actual _quantity_\r\ndelivered. The unit of rate of flow or current is called the _ampere_.\r\n\r\nIn determining the exact _quantity_ of an electric current, physicists\r\nmake use of a device called a _coulomb meter_. (See Fig. 247.) This\r\ncontains a solution of silver nitrate in which are placed two silver\r\nplates. The current to be measured is sent through the solution, in at\r\none plate and out at the other. The plate where the current goes _in_,\r\nthe _anode_, _A_ (Fig. 247), loses in weight since some of the silver is\r\ndissolved. The plate where the current goes _out_, the _cathode_, _C_,\r\nincreases in weight since some of the silver is deposited. By an\r\ninternational agreement, _the intensity of the current which deposits\r\nsilver at the rate of 0.001118 g. per second is 1 ampere_. This is equal\r\nto 4.025 g. per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 247.--A coulomb meter, the anode _A_ is separated\r\nfrom the cathode _C_ by a porous cup.]\r\n\r\nThe _coulomb_ is defined as the quantity of electricity delivered by a\r\ncurrent of one ampere during one second.\r\n\r\nA 40-watt-incandescent lamp takes about 0.4 ampere of current. An arc\r\nlamp takes from 6 to 15 amperes. A new dry cell may send 20 amperes\r\nthrough a testing meter. A street car may take from 50 to 100 amperes.\r\n\r\n=265. The Ammeter.=--The method described above is not used ordinarily\r\nfor measuring current strengths on account of its inconvenience. The\r\nusual device employed is an _ammeter_. This instrument is a _moving-coil\r\ngalvanometer_. It contains, wound on a light form, a coil of fine\r\ncopper wire. The form is mounted on jewel bearings between the poles of\r\na strong permanent horseshoe magnet. (See Fig. 248.) As in other\r\nmoving-coil galvanometers, a soft iron cylinder within the form\r\nconcentrates the field of the magnet. The form and its coil is held in\r\nbalance by two spiral springs which also conduct current into and out of\r\nthe coil.\r\n\r\nOnly a small part of the whole current measured, in some cases only\r\n0.0001 passes through the coil, the larger part of the current passing\r\nthrough a metal wire or strip called a _shunt_[L] (see Fig. 248)\r\nconnecting the binding posts of the instrument. A fixed fraction of the\r\nwhole current flows through the coil. Its field crossing the field of\r\nthe horseshoe magnet, tends to turn until its turning force is balanced\r\nby the spiral springs. As the coil turns it moves a pointer attached to\r\nit across a scale graduated to indicate the number of amperes in the\r\nwhole current.\r\n\r\n  [L] A shunt is a conductor or coil connected in parallel with\r\n  another conductor or circuit. It carries a part of the current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 248.--Diagram of a commercial ammeter. _S_ is the\r\nshunt.]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that while _all_ of the current measured passed\r\nthrough the ammeter, but a small _part_ goes through the coil.\r\n\r\n=266. Resistance of Conductors.=--With an ammeter one may study the\r\nchange produced in the amount of current flowing in a wire when a change\r\nis made in the wire conducting the current. For example, if one measures\r\nwith an ammeter the current flowing from a dry cell through a long and\r\nthen through a short piece of fine copper wire, it will be seen that\r\nless current flows when the long piece is used. That is, the long wire\r\nseems to hinder or to _resist_ the passing of the current more than the\r\nshort piece. In other words, the long wire is said to have more\r\n_resistance_.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of a conducting body is affected by several conditions.\r\n\r\n(a) It is _directly_ proportional to the _length_ of the conductor, one\r\nhundred feet of wire having twice the resistance of fifty feet.\r\n\r\n(b) It is _inversely_ proportional to the _square of the diameter_; a\r\nwire 0.1 inch in diameter has four times the resistance of a wire 0.2\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\n(c) It differs with different substances, iron having about six times as\r\nmuch as copper.\r\n\r\n(d) It varies with the temperature, metals having greater resistance at\r\na higher temperature.\r\n\r\nSince silver is the best conductor known, the resistances of other\r\nsubstances are compared with it as a standard.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the resistance of a wire of any substance as compared to\r\nthe resistance of a silver wire of exactly the same diameter and length\r\nis called its _relative_ resistance.\r\n\r\nPurified substances arranged in order of increasing resistance for the\r\nsame length and sectional area (Ayrton-Mather) are given on p. 294.\r\n\r\n  Silver annealed            1.00\r\n  Copper annealed { from     1.04\r\n                  { to       1.09\r\n  Aluminum annealed          1.64\r\n  Nickel annealed            4.69\r\n  Platinum annealed          6.09\r\n  Iron annealed              6.56\r\n  German Silver { from      12.80\r\n                { to        20.20\r\n  Mercury                   63.30\r\n  Nichrome                  67.50\r\n  Carbon { from           2700.00\r\n         { to             6700.00\r\n\r\n=267. The ohm, the unit of resistance=, is defined by international\r\nagreement as follows: _An ohm is the resistance of a column of pure\r\nmercury, 106.3 cm. long with a cross-section of a square millimeter and\r\nat a temperature of 0°C._\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that each of the four conditions affecting resistance\r\nis mentioned in the definition, viz., length, cross-section, material,\r\nand temperature. Since it is inconvenient to handle mercury, _standard\r\nresistance coils_, made of an alloy of high resistance are used in\r\ncomparing and measuring resistances.\r\n\r\nA piece of copper wire No. 22 (diameter 0.644 mm.) 60. 5 ft. long has a\r\nresistance of 1 ohm. See table p. 296.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of some telephone receivers is 75 ohms, of a telegraph\r\nsounder, 4 ohms, of a relay 200 ohms.\r\n\r\n=268. Resistance of Circuits.=--Every part of an electrical circuit\r\npossesses resistance. In an electric-bell circuit, for instance, the\r\nwires, the bell, the push-button, and the cell itself, each offers a\r\ndefinite resistance to the passage of the current. The resistance\r\n_within the cell_ is termed _internal resistance_, while the resistance\r\nof the parts outside of the electric generator is called _external\r\nresistance_.\r\n\r\n=269. Electromotive Force.=--In order to set in motion anything, some\r\n_force_ must be applied. This is as true of electricity as of solids,\r\nliquids, or gases. By analogy that which is exerted by a battery or by a\r\ndynamo in causing current to flow is called an _electromotive force_.\r\nThe unit of electromotive force, the _volt_, may be defined as _the\r\nelectromotive force that will drive a current of 1 ampere through the\r\nresistance of 1 ohm_. The electromotive force of a dry cell is about 1.5\r\nvolts, of a Daniell cell 1.08 volts. Most electric light circuits in\r\nbuildings carry current at 110 or 220 volts pressure. Currents for\r\nstreet cars have an electromotive force of from 550 to 660 volts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 249.--Diagram of a commercial voltmeter.]\r\n\r\n=270. The Voltmeter.=--An instrument for measuring the electromotive\r\nforce of electric currents is called a _voltmeter_ (Fig. 249). It is\r\nusually a moving-coil galvanometer, and is always of _high resistance_.\r\nIt is like an ammeter in construction and appearance. In fact, a\r\nvoltmeter is an ammeter which has had its shunt removed or disconnected.\r\nIn place of a shunt, the voltmeter uses a coil of wire of high\r\nresistance (see _R_, Fig. 249) _in series_ with the galvanometer coil.\r\nThe high resistance of the voltmeter permits but a very small current to\r\nflow through it. Hence a voltmeter must be placed _across_ a circuit\r\nand not in it. In other words _a voltmeter is connected in shunt_,\r\nwhile _an ammeter is in series with the circuit_ as is shown in Fig.\r\n250.\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF COPPER WIRES\r\n\r\n  Column headings:\r\n\r\n   B: B. & S. gauge number\r\n  MM: Millimeters\r\n  SA: Sectional area in square millimeters\r\n  WL: Weight and length, Density = 8.9, feet per pound\r\n   R: Resistance at 24°C., feet per ohm\r\n   C: Capacity in amperes\r\n\r\n  ----+--------------+----------+---------+---------+----------+------\r\n      |   Diameter   |          |         |         |          |\r\n    B +-------+------+ Circular |   SA    |   WL    |    R     |  C\r\n      | Mils  |  MM  |   mils   |         |         |          |\r\n  ----+-------+------+----------+---------+---------+----------+------\r\n  0000|460.000|11.684|211,600.00|107.219  |     1.56|19,929.700|312.0\r\n   000|409.640|10.405|167,805.00| 85.028  |     1.97|15,804.900|262.0\r\n    00|364.800| 9.266|133,079.40| 67.431  |     2.49|12,534.200|220.0\r\n     0|324.950| 8.254|105,592.50| 53.470  |     3.13| 9,945.300|185.0\r\n     2|257.630| 6.544| 66,373.00| 33.631  |     4.99| 6,251.400|131.0\r\n     4|204.310| 5.189| 41,742.00| 21.151  |     7.93| 3,931.600| 92.3\r\n     6|162.020| 4.115| 26,250.50| 13.301  |    12.61| 2,472.400| 65.2\r\n     8|128.490| 3.264| 16,509.00|  8.366  |    20.05| 1,555.000| 46.1\r\n    10|101.890| 2.588| 10,381.00|  5.260  |    31.38|   977.800| 32.5\r\n    12| 80.808| 2.053|  6,529.90|  3.309  |    50.69|   615.020| 23.0\r\n    14| 64.084| 1.628|  4,106.80|  2.081  |    80.59|   386.800| 16.2\r\n    16| 50.820| 1.291|  2,582.90|  1.309  |   128.14|   243.250| 11.5\r\n    18| 40.303| 1.024|  1,624.30|  0.823  |   203.76|   152.990|  8.1\r\n    20| 31.961| 0.812|  1,021.50|  0.5176 |   324.00|    96.210|  5.7\r\n    22| 25.347| 0.644|    642.70|  0.3255 |   515.15|    60.510|  4.0\r\n    24| 20.100| 0.511|    504.01|  0.2047 |   819.21|    38.050|  2.8\r\n    26| 15.940| 0.405|    254.01|  0.1288 | 1,302.61|    23.930|  2.0\r\n    28| 12.641| 0.321|    159.79|  0.08097| 2,071.22|    15.050|  1.4\r\n    30| 10.025| 0.255|    100.50|  0.05092| 3,293.97|     9.466|  1.0\r\n    32|  7.950| 0.202|     63.20|  0.03203| 5,236.66|     5.952|  0.70\r\n    34|  6.304| 0.160|     39.74|  0.02014| 8,328.30|     3.743|  0.50\r\n    36|  5.000| 0.127|     25.00|  0.01267|13,238.83|     2.355|  0.35\r\n    38|  3.965| 0.101|     15.72|  0.00797|20,854.65|     1.481|  0.25\r\n    40|  3.144| 0.080|      9.89|  0.00501|33,175.94|     0.931|  0.17\r\n  ----+-------+------+----------+---------+---------+----------+------\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n(1) _Galvanometers_: (1) moving magnet, fixed coil; (2) moving coil,\r\nfixed magnet, ammeter, voltmeter.\r\n\r\n(2) _Unit of quantity, coulomb._\r\n\r\n(3) _Unit of current, ampere._\r\n\r\n(4) _Unit of resistance, ohm._\r\n\r\n(5) _Unit of electromotive force, volt._\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1.

What would happen if a voltmeter were put in series in a line?\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) OHM'S LAW AND ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS\r\n\r\n=271. Conditions Affecting Current Flow.=--Sometimes over a long circuit\r\none cell will not work a telegraph sounder. In such a case, two, three,\r\nor more cells are connected so that the zinc of one is joined to the\r\ncopper plate of the other. When connected in this way the cells are said\r\nto be _in series_ (Fig. 251). In the figure _A_ represents a voltmeter.\r\nIt is found that _when cells are in series the E.M.F. of the battery is\r\nthe sum of the electromotive forces of the cells_. An ammeter in the\r\ncircuit shows increased current as the cells are added. Hence _if the\r\nresistance of the circuit remains unchanged, the greater the E.M.F. the\r\ngreater is the current strength_. In this respect, the movement of\r\nelectricity in a circuit is similar to the flow of water in a small pipe\r\nunder pressure, as in the latter the flow of water increases as the\r\npressure becomes greater. The current in a circuit may also be increased\r\nby lessening the resistance, since the current through a long wire is\r\nless than that through a short one, just as the flow of water will be\r\ngreater through a short pipe than through a long one. To increase the\r\ncurrent flowing in an electric circuit, one may therefore either\r\nincrease the E.M.F. or decrease the resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 251.--Diagram of cells connected in series.]\r\n\r\n=272. Ohm's Law.=--The relation between the electromotive force applied\r\nto a circuit, its resistance, and the current produced was discovered in\r\n1827 by George Ohm. Ohm's law, one of the most important laws of\r\nelectricity, states that, in any circuit, _the current in amperes equals\r\nthe electromotive force in volts divided by the resistance in ohms_.\r\n\r\nThis principle is usually expressed thus:\r\n\r\n  Current intensity = electromotive force/resistance or\r\n\r\n  Amperes = volts/ohms or _I_ = _E_/_R_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252.--The street cars are connected in parallel with\r\neach other.]\r\n\r\n=273. Resistance of Conductors in Series.=--A study of the _resistance_\r\nof conductors when alone and when grouped in various ways is of\r\nimportance _since, the current flow through any circuit is dependent\r\nupon its resistance_. The two most common methods of combining several\r\nconductors in a circuit are in _series_ and in _parallel_. Conductors\r\nare in _series_ when all of the current passes through each of the\r\nconductors in turn (Fig. 218), thus the cell, push-button, wires, and\r\nelectric bell in an electric-bell circuit are in series. Conductors are\r\nin _parallel_ when they are so connected that they are side by side and\r\na part of the whole current goes through each. None of the current that\r\npasses through one conductor can go through the conductors in parallel\r\nwith it. Thus the electric street cars are in _parallel_ with each\r\nother. (See Fig. 252.) It is easily seen that none of the current\r\npassing through one car can go through any of the others. When the\r\nconductors are in _series_ the combined resistance is the _sum_ of the\r\nseveral resistances. Thus in an electric-bell circuit if the battery has\r\na resistance of 1 ohm, the bell of 2 ohms, and the wire 1 ohm, the total\r\nresistance in the circuit is 4 ohms. When conductors are in _parallel_\r\nthe combined resistance is always _less_ than the separate resistances.\r\nJust as a crowd of people meets less resistance in leaving a building\r\nthrough several exits, so electricity finds less resistance in moving\r\nfrom one point to another along several parallel lines, than along one\r\nof the lines.\r\n\r\n=274. Resistance of Conductors in Parallel.=--If three conductors of\r\nequal resistance are in parallel, the combined resistance is just\r\none-third the resistance of each separately (Fig. 253). The rule that\r\nstates the relation between the combined resistance of conductors in\r\nparallel and the separate resistances is as follows:_The combined\r\nresistance of conductors in parallel is the reciprocal of the sum of the\r\nreciprocals of the several resistances_. For example, find the combined\r\nresistance of three unequal resistances in parallel; the first being 4\r\nohms, the second, 6 ohms, and third 3 ohms. The reciprocals of the three\r\nresistances are 1/4, 1/6, and 1/3. Their sum equals 6/24 + 4/24 + 8/24 =\r\n18/24. The reciprocal of this is 24/18 which equals 1-1/3 ohms, the\r\ncombined resistance.\r\n\r\nFIG. 253.--The three conductors are connected in parallel.\r\n\r\n     This rule may be understood better if we consider the _conductance_\r\n     of the conductors in parallel. Since the conductance of a two ohm\r\n     wire is just one-half that of a one-ohm wire, we say that the\r\n     conductance of a body is inversely as the resistance, or that it is\r\n     the _reciprocal of the resistance_. The conductance of the 4-, 6-,\r\n     and 3-ohm coils will therefore be respectively 1/4, 1/6, and 1/3,\r\n     and since the combined conductance is the sum of the several\r\n     conductances, the total conductance is 18/24. Also since this is\r\n     the reciprocal of the total resistance, the latter is 24/18 or\r\n     1-1/3 ohms.\r\n\r\nWhen two or more conductors are connected in parallel each one is said\r\nto be a _shunt_ of the others. Many circuits are connected in _shunt_ or\r\nin parallel. Fig. 254 represents four lamps in parallel. Incandescent\r\nlamps in buildings are usually connected in parallel, while arc lamps\r\nare usually connected in series. Fig. 255 represents four lamps in\r\nseries.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Conditions affecting current flow, (a) E.M.F., (b) resistance.\r\n\r\n2.

What current flows through a circuit if its E.M.F. is 110 volts and\r\nthe resistance is 220 ohms?\r\n\r\n2.

Internal Resistance of a Voltaic Cell.=--The current produced by a\r\nvoltaic cell is affected by the resistance that the current meets in\r\npassing from one plate to another through the liquid of the cell. This\r\nis called the _internal resistance_ of the cell. A Daniell cell has\r\nseveral (1-5) ohms internal resistance. The resistance of dry cells\r\nvaries from less than 0.1 of an ohm when new to several ohms when old.\r\nIf cells are joined together their combined internal resistance depends\r\nupon the method of grouping the cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 256.--The four cans exert four times the water\r\npressure that one can will exert.]\r\n\r\n=276. Cells Grouped in Series and in Parallel.=--When in _series_ the\r\ncopper or carbon plate of one cell is joined to the zinc of another and\r\nso on. (See Fig. 251.) The effect of connecting, say four cells, in\r\nseries may be illustrated by taking four cans of water, placed one above\r\nanother. (See Fig. 256.) The combined water pressure of the series is\r\nthe sum of the several pressures of the cans of water, while the\r\nopposition offered to the movement of a quantity of water through the\r\ngroup of cans is the sum of the several resistances of the cans. In\r\napplying this illustration to the voltaic cell, we make use of Ohm's\r\nlaw. Let _E_ represent the e.m.f. of a single cell, _r_ the internal\r\nresistance of the cell, and _R_ the external resistance or the\r\nresistance of the rest of the circuit. Consider a group of cells in\r\nseries. If _n_ represents the _number_ of cells in _series_, then Ohm's\r\nlaw becomes\r\n\r\n     _I_ = _nE_/(_nr_ + _R_).\r\n\r\nCells are grouped in _series_ when large E.M.F. is required to force a\r\ncurrent through a large external resistance such as through a long\r\ntelegraph line. Cells are connected in _parallel_ when it is desired to\r\nsend a large current through a small external resistance. To connect\r\ncells in parallel all the copper plates are joined and also all the zinc\r\nplates. (See Fig. 257.) To illustrate the effect of this mode of\r\ngrouping cells, suppose several cans of water are placed side by side\r\n(Fig. 258). It is easily seen that the pressure of the group is the same\r\nas that of a single cell, while the resistance to the flow is less than\r\nthat of a single cell. Applying this reasoning to the electric circuit\r\nwe have by Ohm's law the formula for the current flow of a group of\r\n\r\n     _n_ cells arranged in parallel _I_ = _E_/((_r/n_) + _R_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 257.--Four cells connected in parallel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 258.--The water pressure of the group in parallel is\r\nthe same as that of one.]\r\n\r\n=277. Illustrative Problems.=--Suppose that four cells are grouped in\r\nparallel, each with an E.M.F. of 1.5 volts and an internal resistance of\r\n2 ohms. What current will flow in the circuit if the external resistance\r\nis 2.5 ohms? Substitute in the formula for cells in parallel the values\r\ngiven above, and we have _I_ = 1.5/(0.5 + 2.5) = 1.5/3 = 0.5 ampere.\r\nSuppose again that these four cells were grouped in series with the same\r\nexternal resistance, substituting the values in the formula for cells in\r\nseries we have _I_ = 4(1.5)/(4 × 2 + 2.5) = 6/10.5 = 0.57 ampere.\r\n\r\n=278. Volt-ammeter Method for Finding Resistance.=--Measurements of the\r\nresistance of conductors are often made. One of these methods depends\r\nupon an application of Ohm's law. It is called the volt-ammeter method\r\nsince it employs both a voltmeter and an ammeter. If the conductor whose\r\nresistance is to be measured is made a part of an electric circuit,\r\nbeing connected _in series with the ammeter_ and _in shunt with the\r\nvoltmeter_, the resistance may easily be determined, since _R_ = _E/I_.\r\n(See Fig. 250.) If, for example, the difference in E.M.F., or as it is\r\noften called, the _fall of potential_ between the ends of the wire as\r\nread on the voltmeter is 2 volts, and the current is 0.5 ampere, then\r\nthe resistance of the wire is 4 ohms. This method may be readily applied\r\nto find the resistance of any wire that is a part of an electric\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\n=279. The Wheatstone Bridge.=--To find the resistance of a separate wire\r\nor of an electrical device another method devised by an Englishman named\r\nWheatstone is commonly employed. This method requires that three known\r\nresistances, _a_, _b_, _c_, in addition to the unknown resistance _x_\r\nbe taken. These four resistances are arranged in the form of a\r\nparallelogram. (See Fig. 259.) A voltaic cell is joined to the\r\nparallelogram at the extremities of one diagonal while a moving-coil\r\ngalvanometer is connected across the extremities of the other diagonal.\r\nThe known resistances are changed until when on pressing the keys at _E_\r\nand _K_ no current flows through the galvanometer. when this condition\r\nis reached, the four resistances form a true proportion, thus _a_: _b_ =\r\n_c_: _x_.\r\n\r\nSince the values of _a_, _b_, and _c_ are known, _x_ is readily\r\ncomputed. Thus if _a_ = 10, _b_ = 100, and _c_ = 1.8 ohms, then _x_, the\r\nunknown resistance, equals 18 ohms, since 10: 100 = 1.8: 18. This method\r\ndevised by Wheatstone may be employed to find the resistance of a great\r\nvariety of objects. It is the one most commonly employed by scientists\r\nand practical electricians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 259.--Diagram of a Wheatstone bridge.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

What is the resistance of an electric bell circuit where the E.M.F.\r\nis 3 volts and the current is 0.6 ampere?\r\n\r\n2. A telegraph wire is broken somewhere, the ends lying upon damp\r\nground. If an E.M.F. of 30 volts is applied from the ground to the wire\r\nand a current of 0.1 of an ampere flows, what is the resistance of the\r\npart connected to the ammeter. (The earth which completes the circuit\r\nfrom the end of the wire has very small resistance.) Why?\r\n\r\n3. How far away is the break in the wire if the latter has a resistance\r\nof 80 ohms to the mile? Diagram.\r\n\r\n4.

If the same three cells are connected in parallel on the same circuit\r\nwhat current flows? Is the current in problem 4 or 5 the larger? Why?\r\n\r\n6.

Electroplating.=--If two carbon rods (electric light carbons\r\nanswer very well) are placed in a solution of _copper sulphate_ (Fig.\r\n260) and then connected by wires to the binding posts of an electric\r\nbattery, one of the rods soon becomes covered with a coating of\r\n_metallic copper_ while bubbles of gas may be seen upon the other\r\ncarbon. If a solution of _lead acetate_ is used in the same way a\r\ndeposit of _metallic lead_ is secured, while a solution of _silver\r\nnitrate_ gives silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 260.--Two carbons placed in a solution of copper\r\nsulphate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 261.--An electroplating bath.]\r\n\r\nThis process of depositing metals upon the surface of solids by an\r\nelectric current is called _electroplating_. Everyone has seen\r\n_electroplated_ articles such as silver plated knives, forks, and\r\nspoons, and nickel-plated rods, handles, etc. _Copper electrotype_\r\nplates such as are used in printing school books are made by this\r\nprocess. In practical electroplating a solution of the metal to be\r\ndeposited is placed in a tank; across the top of this tank are placed\r\ncopper rods to act as conducting supports. From one of these rods, the\r\ncathode, objects to be plated are hung so as to be immersed in the\r\nliquid. From other rods, the anodes, are hung plates of the metal to be\r\ndeposited. These are dissolved as the current deposits a coating upon\r\nthe articles, thus keeping the solution up to its proper strength. (See\r\nFig. 261.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 262.--The current is carried through the solution by\r\nions.]\r\n\r\n=281. Electrolysis.=--A solution from which a deposit is made by an\r\nelectric current is called an _electrolyte_. The plates or other objects\r\nby which the current enters or leaves the electrolyte are called the\r\n_electrodes_. The electrode by which the current enters is called the\r\n_anode_ (_an_ = in) while the electrode by which it leaves is the\r\ncathode (_cath_ = away). The process by which an electric current\r\ndecomposes a solution and deposits a substance upon an electrode is\r\ncalled _electrolysis_. The _current_ always flows within the cell from\r\n_anode to the cathode_. (See Fig. 262.) The metal goes with the current\r\nand is found deposited upon the cathode.\r\n\r\n=282. Theory of Electrolysis.=--The action going on in an _electrolytic_\r\ncell has been carefully studied. The _theory of electrolysis_, which is\r\nsupported by much experimental evidence, supposes that many of the\r\nmolecules in a _dilute_ solution of a substance \"split up\" into two\r\nparts called \"ions,\" one ion having a positive, the other a negative\r\ncharge. In a dilute solution of sulphuric acid, the _positive_ ion is of\r\nhydrogen, while the _negative_ ion is the (SO_{4}) or sulphion. These\r\nions bearing electric charges are believed to be the _carriers of the\r\nelectric current_ through the electrolyte.\r\n\r\nThe positive ions move with the current from the anode to the cathode,\r\nwhile the negative ions apparently are repelled by the cathode and\r\nappear upon the anode. Evidence of the accumulation of the two kinds of\r\nions at the two electrodes is furnished by the _electrolysis_ of water,\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\n=283. Electrolysis of Water.=--Two glass tubes (Fig. 263), _H_ and _O_,\r\nare attached at the bottom to a horizontal glass tube. To the latter is\r\nalso connected an upright tube _T_. At the lower ends of _H_ and _O_ are\r\ninserted, fused in the glass, platinum wires, _A_ and _C_. The tubes are\r\nfilled with a weak solution of sulphuric acid. The tops of _H_ and _O_\r\nare closed with stopcocks, _T_ being open; a current of electricity is\r\nsent in at _A_ and out at _C_. A movement of the ions at once begins,\r\nthe positive hydrogen ions appearing at _C_. These accumulate as bubbles\r\nof hydrogen which rise to the top of _H_ and displace the liquid. At the\r\nsame time bubbles of oxygen appear at _A_. These rise in _O_ and also\r\ndisplace the liquid which rises in _T_. After the action has continued\r\nsome time it may be noticed that the volume of hydrogen is just twice\r\nthat of the oxygen. This was to have been expected since the formula\r\nfor water is H_{2}O. The nature of the gas in _H_ or _O_ may be tested\r\nby opening the stopcock and allowing the gas to escape slowly. The\r\nhydrogen gas can be lighted by a flame while the oxygen gas will cause a\r\nspark upon a piece of wood to glow brightly, but does not burn itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 263.-Electrolysis of water; oxygen collects in _O_,\r\nhydrogen in _H_.]\r\n\r\n=284. Evidence that ions are necessary to conduct a current in a liquid=\r\nis furnished by the following experiment. A quart jar is carefully\r\ncleaned, and half filled with distilled water. Two pieces of zinc 5 cm.\r\nsquare are soldered to pieces of rubber-insulated No. 14 copper wire.\r\nThe zincs are placed in the distilled water (Fig. 264) and the wires are\r\nconnected to a 110 volt circuit with a 16 candle-power incandescent lamp\r\nin _series_ with the cell, as in the figure. If the zincs have been\r\ncarefully cleansed and the water is pure, no current flows as is shown\r\nby the lamp remaining dark. If a minute quantity of sulphuric acid or of\r\ncommon salt is placed in the water the lamp at once begins to glow. Ions\r\nare now present in the liquid and conduct the current. That some\r\nsubstances in solution do not form ions may be shown by adding to\r\nanother jar of pure water some glycerine and some cane sugar, substances\r\nresembling the acid and salt in external appearance but which do not\r\n_ionize_ when dissolved as is shown by the lamp remaining dark after\r\nadding the glycerine and sugar. The acid and salt are of _mineral_\r\norigin while the glycerine and sugar are _vegetable_ products. This\r\nexperiment illustrates the principle that the water will conduct only\r\nwhen it contains ions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 264.--The current passes only when ions are present\r\nin the liquid.]\r\n\r\n=285. Laws of Electrolysis.=--These were discovered by Faraday in 1833,\r\nand may be stated as follows: _I. The mass of a substance deposited by\r\nan electric current from an electrolyte is proportional to the intensity\r\nof current which passes through it._\r\n\r\n_II. The mass of any substance deposited by a current of uniform\r\nintensity is directly proportional to the time the current flows._\r\n\r\nThese laws have been used as a basis for defining and measuring the unit\r\nof current flow, the _ampere_. (See Art. 264.)\r\n\r\n=286. Instances of Electrolysis.=--(a) Medicines, especially those\r\ncontaining a mineral substance, are sometimes introduced into the human\r\nbody by electrolysis. (b) Water and gas pipes are sometimes much\r\nweakened by the effects of electric currents in the earth, especially\r\nreturn currents from street railways. Such currents use the metal pipes\r\nas a conductor. At the place where the current leaves the metal and\r\nenters the ground, it removes metallic ions from the pipe. This process\r\ncontinuing, the pipe becomes weakened and at length breaks. (c) _Copper_\r\nis purified by the use of electric currents that remove the copper from\r\nore or from other metals and deposit it upon electrodes. _Electrolytic_\r\ncopper is the purest known. (d) _Aluminum_ is obtained by the use of\r\nlarge currents of electricity that first heat the material used until it\r\nmelts and then deposit the metal from the fluid material by\r\nelectrolysis. These results are called chemical effects of the current\r\nsince by the use of electric currents substances are changed chemically,\r\nthat is, they are separated into different chemical substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

If 1000 g. of silver are deposited on the cathode of an electrolytic\r\nreduction plant in 10 minutes, what is the current intensity employed?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) THE STORAGE BATTERY AND ELECTRIC POWER\r\n\r\n=287. Differences Between Voltaic and Storage Cells.= Voltaic cells in\r\nwhich electric currents are produced by the chemical action between\r\nmetal plates and an electrolyte are often called _primary batteries_. In\r\nvoltaic cells one or both plates and the electrolyte are used up or lose\r\ntheir chemical energy in producing the current and after a time need to\r\nbe replaced by new material, the _chemical energy_ of the electrolyte\r\nand of one of the plates having been _transformed_ into electrical\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nA different proceeding obtains with another type of cell. This is\r\ncalled a _storage battery_, or an accumulator. In these cells, the same\r\n_plates_ and electrolyte are _used_ without change _for extended\r\nperiods_, sometimes for a number of years. For this reason storage\r\nbatteries have displaced many other types of cells, and they are now\r\nused (a) to operate many telephone, telegraph, and fire-alarm circuits,\r\n(b) to work the spark coils of gas and gasoline engines, (c) to help\r\ncarry the \"peak\" load upon lighting and power circuits and (d) to\r\nfurnish power for electric automobiles. Since a storage battery can\r\ndeliver an electric current only after an electric current from an\r\noutside source has first been sent through it, they are often called\r\n_secondary batteries_.\r\n\r\n=288. Construction and Action of a Storage Cell.=--The common type of\r\nstorage cells consists of a _number of perforated_ plates made of an\r\nalloy of lead and a little antimony. (See Figs. 265, 266, 267.) Into the\r\nperforations is pressed a paste of red lead and litharge mixed with\r\nsulphuric acid. The plates are placed in a strong solution (20 to 25 per\r\ncent.) of sulphuric acid. The plates are now ready to be charged. This\r\nis accomplished by sending a direct current from an electric generator\r\nthrough the cell. The hydrogen ions are moved by the current to one set\r\nof plates and change the paste to _spongy_ metallic lead. The sulphions\r\nmove to the other set of plates and change the paste to lead oxide. This\r\nelectrolytic action causes the two plates to become quite different\r\nchemically so that when the cell is fully charged it is like a voltaic\r\ncell, in having plates that are different chemically. It has, when fully\r\ncharged, an E.M.F. of about 2.2 volts. The several plates of a cell\r\nbeing in parallel and close together, the cell has but small internal\r\nresistance. Consequently a large current is available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 265.--The positive plate of a storage cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 266.--The negative plate of a storage cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 267.--A complete storage cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 268.]\r\n\r\nAbout 75 per cent. of the energy put into the storage cell in charging\r\ncan be obtained upon _discharging_. Therefore the _efficiency_ of a good\r\nstorage cell is about 75 per cent. Fig. 268 represents a storage battery\r\nconnected to charging and discharging circuits. The lower is the\r\ncharging circuit. It contains a dynamo and a resistance (neither of\r\nwhich are shown in the figure) to control the current sent into the\r\ncell. The charging current enters the positive pole and leaves by the\r\nnegative pole. The current produced by the cell, however, flows in the\r\n_opposite_ direction through it, that is, out from the positive and in\r\nat the negative pole. This current may be controlled by a suitable\r\nresistance and measured by an ammeter. Storage cells have several\r\nadvantages: (a) They can be charged and discharged a great many times\r\nbefore the material placed in the perforations in the plates falls out.\r\n(b) The electrical energy used in charging the plates _costs less_ than\r\nthe plates and electrolyte of voltaic cells. (c) Charging storage cells\r\ntakes much _less labor_ than replacing the electrolyte and plates of\r\nvoltaic cells. (d) Storage cells produce _larger currents_ than voltaic\r\ncells. The two principal _disadvantages_ of storage cells are that (a)\r\nthey are _very heavy_, and (b) their initial _cost_ is _considerable_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 269.--The Edison storage cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 270.--The plates of the Edison storage cell.]\r\n\r\n=289. The Edison storage cell= (Figs. 269 and 270) has plates of iron\r\nand nickel oxide. The electrolyte is a strong solution of potassium\r\nhydroxide. These cells are lighter than lead cells of the same capacity\r\nand they are claimed to have a longer life.\r\n\r\n=290. Energy and Power of a Storage Cell.=--In a storage cell, the\r\nelectrical energy of the charging current is transformed into _chemical_\r\nenergy by the action of electrolysis. It is this chemical energy that is\r\ntransformed into the energy of the electric current when the cell is\r\ndischarged. The _capacity_ of storage cells is rated in \"ampere hours,\"\r\na 40 ampere hour cell being capable of producing a current of 1 ampere\r\nfor 40 hours, or 5 amperes for 8 hours, etc. The production and\r\nextensive use of electric currents have made necessary accurate methods\r\nfor measuring the _energy_ and _power_ of these currents. To illustrate\r\nhow this is accomplished, let us imagine an electric circuit as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 268. Here four storage cells in series have an\r\nE.M.F. of 8 volts and in accordance with Ohm's law produce a current of\r\n2 amperes through a resistance in the circuit of 4 ohms. Now the work\r\ndone or energy expended by the current in passing through the resistance\r\nbetween the points _M_ and _N depends_ upon three factors (1) the E.M.F.\r\nor _potential difference_; (2) the _current intensity_ and (3) the\r\n_time_. The energy is measured by their product. That is, _electrical\r\nenergy_ = _potential difference_ × _current intensity_ × _time_. This\r\nrepresents the electrical energy in _joules_, or\r\n\r\n  Joules = volts × amperes × seconds, or\r\n  _j_ = _E_ × _I_ × _t_.\r\n\r\nIn the circuit represented in Fig. 268 the energy expended between the\r\npoints _M_ and _N_ in 1 minute (60 seconds) is 8 × 2 × 60 = 960 joules.\r\n\r\n=291. Electric Power.=--Since power refers to the _time rate_ at which\r\nwork is done or energy expended, it may be computed by dividing the\r\nelectrical energy by the time, or the _electrical power_ = _volts_ ×\r\n_amperes_. The power of 1 joule per second is called a _watt_.\r\nTherefore,\r\n\r\n  Watts = volts × amperes, or\r\n  Watts = _E_ × _I_.\r\n\r\nOther units of power are the _kilowatt_ = 1000 watts and the\r\n_horse-power_ = 746 watts. In the example given in Art. 290 the power of\r\nthe current is 8 × 2 = 16 watts, or if the energy of the current\r\nexpended between the joints _M_ and _N_ were converted into mechanical\r\nhorse-power it would equal 16/746 of a horse-power. Electrical energy is\r\nusually sold by the _kilowatt-hour_, or the amount of electrical energy\r\nthat would exert a power of 1000 watts for one hour, or of 100 watts for\r\n10 hours, or of 50 watts for 20 hours, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Electric power, three units, value, how computed, how sold?\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1. In what three respects are voltaic and storage cells alike? In what\r\ntwo ways different?\r\n\r\n2. Name the four advantages of storage cells in the order of their\r\nimportance. Give your reasons for choosing this order.\r\n\r\n3. Why are dry cells more suitable for operating a door-bell circuit,\r\nthan a storage battery? Give two reasons.\r\n\r\n4. The current for a city telephone system is provided by a storage\r\nbattery. Why is this better than dry cells at each telephone?\r\n\r\n5. An incandescent lamp takes 0.5 ampere at 110 volts. What power is\r\nrequired to operate it?

What horse-power must be applied to a dynamo having an efficiency of\r\ngo per cent. if it is to light 20 arc lamps in series, each taking 10\r\namperes at 60 volts?\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) THE HEAT EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTS\r\n\r\n=292. The Production of Heat by an Electric Current.=--When no chemical\r\nor mechanical work is done by an electric current its energy is employed\r\nin overcoming the resistance of the conducting circuit and is\r\ntransformed into _heat_. This effect has many practical applications and\r\nsome disadvantages. Many devices employ the heating effect of electric\r\ncurrents, (a) the electric furnace, (b) electric lights, (c) heating\r\ncoils for street cars, (d) devices about the home, as flat irons,\r\ntoasters, etc. Sometimes the heat produced by an electric current in the\r\nwires of a device such as a transformer is so large in amount that\r\nespecial means of cooling are employed. Unusually heavy currents have\r\nbeen known to melt the conducting wires of circuits and electrical\r\ndevices. Hence all circuits for electric power as well as many others\r\nthat ordinarily carry small currents are protected by _fuses_. An\r\n_electric fuse_ is a short piece of wire that will melt and break the\r\ncircuit if the current exceeds a determined value. The fuse wire is\r\nusually enclosed in an incombustible holder. Fuse wire is frequently\r\nmade of lead or of an alloy of lead and other easily fusible metals.\r\n(See Figs. 271 and 272.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 271.--A type of enclosed fuse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 272.--A link fuse (above); plug fuses (below).]\r\n\r\n=293. Heat Developed in a Conductor.=--A rule for computing the amount\r\nof heat produced in an electric circuit by a given current has been\r\naccurately determined by experiment. It has been found that 1 _calorie_\r\nof heat (Art. 142), is produced by an expenditure of 4.2 joules of\r\nelectrical (or other) energy. In other words, 1 joule will produce 1/4.2\r\nor 0.24 calorie. Now the number of joules of electrical energy in an\r\nelectric circuit is expressed by the following formula:\r\n\r\nJoules = volts × amperes × seconds, or since 1 joule = 0.24 calorie,\r\n\r\n  Calories = volts × amperes × seconds × 0.24 or\r\n  _H_ = _EI_ × _t_ × 0.24       (1)\r\n\r\nBy Ohm's law, _I_ = _E_/_R_ or _E_ = _I_ × _R_, substituting in equation\r\n(1) _IR_ for its equal _E_ we have\r\n\r\n  _H_ = _I²R_ × _t_ × 0.24       (2)\r\n\r\nAlso since _I_ = _E_/_R_ substitute _E_/_R_ for _I_ in equation (1) and\r\nwe have\r\n\r\n  _H_ = _E²_/_R_ _t_ × 0.24       (3)\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the use of these formulas by a problem suppose that a\r\ncurrent of 10 amperes is flowing in a circuit having a resistance of 11\r\nohms, for 1 minute. The heat produced will be by formula (2) = (10)² ×\r\n11 × 60 × 0.24 equals 15,840 calories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 273.--A carbon filament incandescent lamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 274.--A tungsten lamp.]\r\n\r\n=294. The Incandescent Lamp.=--One of the most common devices employing\r\nthe heat effect of an electric current is the _incandescent lamp_. (See\r\nFig. 273.) In this lamp the current is sent through a carbon filament,\r\nwhich is heated to incandescence. In order to keep the filament from\r\nburning as well as to prevent loss of heat by convection, it is placed\r\nin a glass bulb from which the air is exhausted. Two platinum wires\r\nfused in the glass connect the carbon filament with the grooved rim and\r\nthe end piece of the base. The end piece and rim connect with the socket\r\nso that an electric current may flow through the filament of the lamp.\r\nThe carbon incandescent lamp has a low efficiency. It takes 0.5 ampere\r\nof current at 110 volts or in other words it requires 55 watts to cause\r\na 16-candle-power lamp to glow brightly, hence 1 candle power in this\r\nlamp takes 55/16 = 3.43 watts.\r\n\r\nThe _efficiency of electric lamps_ is measured by the _number of watts\r\nper candle power_. This is a peculiar use of the term efficiency, as the\r\nlarger the number the less efficient is the lamp. More efficient lamps\r\nhave been devised with filaments of the metals _tantalum_ and _tungsten_\r\n(Fig. 274). These give a whiter light than do carbon lamps, and consume\r\nbut about 1.25 watts per candle power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE \"EFFICIENCY\" OF ELECTRIC LAMPS\r\n\r\n  ------------------+----------+----------------+------------\r\n                    |Watts per |                | Watts per\r\n    Name of lamp    |  candle  | Name of lamp   |  candle\r\n                    |  power   |                |   power\r\n  ------------------+----------+----------------+------------\r\n  Carbon filament   |  3 to 4  |Arc lamp        | 0.5 to 0.8\r\n  Metallized carbon |   2.5    |Mercury arc     |    0.6\r\n  Tantalum          |   2.0    |Flaming arc     |    0.4\r\n  Tungsten          |  1.0 to  |Nitrogen-filled | 0.6 to 0.7\r\n                    |   1.5    | tungsten       |\r\n  ------------------+----------+----------------+------------\r\n\r\nIncandescent lamps are connected in parallel (see Fig. 254) to wires\r\nthat are kept at a constant difference of potential of 110 or 115 volts.\r\nIt is customary to place not more than twelve lamps upon one circuit,\r\neach circuit being protected by a fuse and controlled by one or more\r\nswitches.\r\n\r\n=295. The Arc Light.=--The electric _arc_ light (see Fig. 275) is\r\nextensively used for lighting large rooms, also in stereopticons and\r\nmotion picture machines. The light is intense, varying from 500 to 1700\r\ncandle power. The so-called mean spherical candle power of the arc light\r\nis about 510. The candle power in the direction of greatest intensity is\r\nabout 1200. It is produced at an expenditure of about 500 watts. It is\r\ntherefore more efficient than the incandescent lamp, often taking less\r\nthan 0.5 watt per candle power produced. The arc light was first devised\r\nby Sir Humphrey Davy in 1809, who used two pieces of charcoal connected\r\nto 2000 voltaic cells. The arc light requires so much power that its\r\nproduction by voltaic cells is very expensive. Consequently it did not\r\ncome into common use until the dynamo had been perfected. Fig. 276 shows\r\nthe appearance of the two carbons in an arc light. If a direct current\r\nis used the positive carbon is heated more intensely, and gives out the\r\ngreater part of the light. The positive carbon is consumed about twice\r\nas fast as the negative and its end is concave, the negative remaining\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 275.--An electric arc light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 276.--The appearance of a pair of used carbons.]\r\n\r\nWith alternating currents, the rods are equally consumed and produce\r\nequal amounts of light. In the stereopticon, the carbons are usually\r\nplaced at right angles as in Fig. 277. In the stereopticon as well as\r\nin outdoor lighting the direct current is more effective, although the\r\nalternating current is often used, since the latter can be produced and\r\ndistributed more cheaply than can direct currents. In arc lamps, placing\r\nan inner glass globe (Fig. 278) about the carbons, decreases the\r\nconsumption of the carbons materially. The carbon rods of _enclosed_ arc\r\nlamps often last 60 to 100 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 277.--A right-angle electric arc lamp for a\r\nstereopticon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 278.--An enclosed arc lamp.]\r\n\r\n     The reason why an _open_ arc lamp needs to be \"retrimmed\" oftener\r\n     than the _enclosed_ lamp, that is, have new carbons placed in it,\r\n     is because the carbons \"burn\" freely, that is unite with the oxygen\r\n     of the air. In the enclosed arc lamp, the supply of oxygen in the\r\n     inner globe is limited and is soon consumed, therefore the carbons\r\n     last many times longer in such lamps.\r\n\r\nSome carbon rods have soft cores containing calcium salts. These\r\nvaporize in the arc producing the _flaming arc light_ of a bright yellow\r\ncolor, and give more light than the ordinary lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Current Induced by a Magnet.=--The discovery in 1819 that a\r\ncurrent in a conductor can deflect a magnetic needle or that it has a\r\nmagnetic effect, led to many attempts _to produce an electric current by\r\nmeans of a magnet_. It was not until about 1831, however, that _Joseph\r\nHenry_ in America and _Michael Faraday_ in England, independently\r\ndiscovered how to accomplish this important result.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, voltaic cells produce but a very small part of the\r\ncurrent electricity used. Practically all that is employed for _power,\r\nlight, heat, and electrolysis is produced by the use of magnetic fields,\r\nor by electromagnetic induction_.\r\n\r\n=297. Laws of Induced Currents.=[M]--To illustrate how a current can be\r\nproduced by electromagnetic induction:\r\n\r\n  [M] An induced current is one produced by changing the number of\r\n  magnetic lines of force passing through a coil.\r\n\r\n     Connect a coil of 400 or more turns of No. 22 insulated copper wire\r\n     to a sensitive galvanometer. (See Fig. 279.) Now insert a bar\r\n     magnet in the coil. A sudden movement of the galvanometer will be\r\n     noticed, indicating the _production of a current_. When the magnet\r\n     stops moving, however, the current stops, and the coil of the\r\n     galvanometer returns to its first position. If now the magnet is\r\n     removed, a movement of the galvanometer coil _in the opposite\r\n     direction is_ noticed. This action may be repeated as often as\r\n     desired with similar results.\r\n\r\nCareful experiments have shown that it is the _magnetic field_ of the\r\nmagnet that produces the action, and that only when the _number of\r\nlines of force in the coil is changing_ do we find a current produced in\r\nthe coil. These facts lead to _Law I_. _Any change in the number of\r\nmagnetic lines of force passing through or cut by a coil will produce an\r\nelectromotive force in the coil._ In the account of the experiment just\r\ngiven, _electric currents_ are produced, while in Law I, _electromotive\r\nforces_ are mentioned. This difference is due to the fact that an E.M.F.\r\nis _always_ produced in a coil when the magnetic field within it is\r\nchanged, while a current is found only when the coil is part of a\r\n_closed circuit_. The inductive action of the earth's magnetic field\r\n(see Fig. 280), may be shown by means of a coil of 400 to 500 turns a\r\nfoot in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 279.--The moving magnet induces a current in the\r\ncoil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 280.--A current may be induced by turning the coil\r\nin the earth's magnetic field.]\r\n\r\n     Connect its ends to a sensitive galvanometer and hold it at right\r\n     angles to the earth's field. Then quickly revolve the coil through\r\n     180 degrees and note the movement of the galvanometer. Reverse the\r\n     coil and the galvanometer swings in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nIf the magnet in Fig. 279 is moved _in_ and _out_ of the coil at first\r\n_slowly_ and _later swiftly_, _small and large_ deflections of the\r\ngalvanometer coil are noticed. The quicker the movement of the magnetic\r\nfield the greater are the galvanometer deflections produced. This leads\r\nto _Law II_. _The electromotive forces produced are proportional to the\r\nnumber of lines of force cut per second._\r\n\r\n=298. The magneto= is a device that illustrates the laws of induced\r\ncurrents stated in Art. 297. The magneto (see Fig. 281), consists of\r\nseveral permanent, \"U\"-shaped magnets placed side by side. Between the\r\npoles of these magnets is placed a slotted iron cylinder having a coil\r\nof many turns of fine insulated copper wire wound in the slot as in Fig.\r\n282. The cylinder and coil form what is called an _armature_. The\r\narmature is mounted so as to be revolved between the poles of the\r\n\"U\"-shaped magnets by means of a handle. As the armature revolves, the\r\nlines of force from the magnets pass through the coil first in one\r\ndirection and then in the other. This repeated change in the lines of\r\nforce passing through the coil produces an E.M.F. which may be felt by\r\nholding in the hands the two wires leading from the armature coil. On\r\nturning the armature _faster_ the current is felt _much stronger_,\r\nshowing that the E.M.F. in the coil increases as the rate of cutting the\r\nmagnetic lines of force by the coils increases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 281.--A magneto.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 282.--A shuttle armature.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 283.--The induced current has a field which opposes\r\nthe motion of the magnet. The heavy line represents the direction of the\r\ninduced current.]\r\n\r\n=299. Lenz's Law.=--While one is turning the armature of a magneto if\r\nthe two wires leading from its coil are connected, forming what is\r\ncalled a \"short circuit,\" the difficulty of turning the armature is at\r\nonce increased. If now the circuit is broken, the armature turns as\r\neasily as at first. The increased difficulty in turning the armature is\r\ndue to the _current_ produced in the coil. This current sets up a\r\nmagnetic field of its own that opposes the field from the steel magnets.\r\nThis opposition makes it necessary for _work_ to be done to keep up the\r\nmotion of the coil when a current is passing through it. This fact is\r\ncalled _Lenz's Law_. It may be expressed as follows: _Whenever a current\r\nis induced by the relative motion of a magnetic field and a conductor,\r\nthe direction of the induced current is always such as to set up a\r\nmagnetic field that opposes the motion._ Lenz's Law follows from the\r\nprinciple of conservation of energy, that energy can be produced only\r\nfrom an expenditure of other energy. Now since an electric current\r\npossesses energy, such a current can be produced only by doing\r\nmechanical work or by expending some other form of energy. To illustrate\r\nLenz's Law, suppose that the north-seeking pole of a bar magnet be\r\ninserted in a closed coil of wire. (See Fig. 283.) The current induced\r\nin the coil has a direction such that its lines of force will pass\r\nwithin the coil so as to _oppose_ the field of the bar magnet, when the\r\nnorth pole of the magnet is inserted so as to point to the left. That\r\nis, the north pole of the helix is at the right. Applying the right-hand\r\nrule to the coil, its current will then be _counter clockwise_. On\r\nwithdrawing the magnet, the current reverses, becoming _clockwise_ with\r\nits field passing to the left within the coil.\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of the opposition offered by the field of the\r\ninduced current to that of the inducing field is afforded by taking a\r\nstrong electromagnet (see Fig. 284) and suspending a sheet of copper so\r\nas to swing freely between the poles. When no current flows through the\r\nmagnet the sheet swings easily for some time. When, however, the coils\r\nare magnetized, the copper sheet has induced within it, currents that\r\nset up magnetic fields strongly opposing the motion, the swinging being\r\nstopped almost instantly. The principle is applied in good ammeters and\r\nvoltmeters to prevent the swinging of the needle when deflected. The\r\ncurrent induced in the metal form on which is wound the galvanometer\r\ncoil is sufficient to make the needle practically \"dead beat.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 284.--The magnetic field stops the swinging of the\r\nsheet of copper.]\r\n\r\n=300. The Magneto and the Dynamo.=--Magnetos are used to _develop small_\r\ncurrents, such as are used for telephone signals, and for operating the\r\n_sparking_ devices of gasoline _engines_. They are therefore found in\r\nautomobiles containing gasoline motors. The most important device for\r\nproducing electric currents by electromagnetic induction, however, is\r\nthe _dynamo_. It is employed whenever large currents are desired. The\r\nprinciple of this device is similar to that of the magneto except that\r\nit contains an _electromagnet_ for producing the magnetic field.\r\nSince the electromagnet can develop a much stronger field than a\r\npermanent magnet, the dynamo can produce a higher E.M.F. and a much\r\nlarger current than the magneto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD KELVIN\r\n\r\n\"By Permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., New York.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin (Sir William Thomson), (1824-1907).

The Magnetic Fields of Generators.=--In the magneto, the magnetic\r\nfield is produced by _permanent_ steel magnets. In dynamos powerful\r\n_electromagnets_ are used. The latter are sometimes excited by currents\r\nfrom some other source, but usually current from the armature is sent\r\naround the field coils to produce the magnetic fields. Dynamos are\r\nclassified according to the manner in which the current is sent to their\r\nfield coils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 285.--A series-wound dynamo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 286.--A shunt-wound dynamo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 287.--A compound-wound dynamo.]\r\n\r\n_A._ The _series wound dynamo_ (see Fig. 285) is arranged so that _all_\r\nof the current produced by the armature is sent through coils of coarse\r\nwire upon the fields, after flowing through the external circuit.\r\n\r\n_B._ The _shunt wound dynamo_ (see Fig. 286) sends a part only of the\r\ncurrent produced through the field coils. The latter are of many turns\r\nof fine wire so as to use as little current as possible. The greater\r\npart of the current goes to the main circuit. If the number of lamps or\r\nmotors connected to the main circuit is increased, the voltage is\r\nlessened which weakens the current in the field coils, causing a weaker\r\nfield and still lower voltage, producing a fluctuating E.M.F. which is\r\nunsatisfactory for many purposes. This fault is overcome by\r\n\r\n_C._ the _compound wound dynamo_. This dynamo has both shunt and series\r\ncoils upon its fields. (See Fig. 287.) If more current is drawn into the\r\nmain circuit with this dynamo, the series coils produce a stronger field\r\ncompensating for the weaker field of the shunt coils, so that uniform\r\nvoltage is maintained. The compound wound generator is therefore the one\r\nmost commonly employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

What will be the\r\ncurrent flowing through a voltmeter having 500 ohms resistance in\r\ncircuit with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) THE DYNAMO AND THE MOTOR\r\n\r\n=302. The Dynamo= may be defined as a machine for transforming\r\nmechanical energy into the energy of electric currents by\r\nelectromagnetic induction. Although electromagnetic induction was\r\ndiscovered in 1821, practical dynamos were not built for about 40 years\r\nor until between 1860 and 1870. The great development in the production\r\nand use of electric currents has come since the latter date. The\r\nprinciple parts of the dynamo are (a) the _field magnet_, (b) the\r\n_armature_, (c) the _commutator_ or _collecting rings_, (d) the\r\n_brushes_. Fig. 288 shows several common methods of arranging the field\r\ncoils and the armature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 288.--Several methods of arranging the field coils\r\nand the armature of a dynamo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 289.--A drum armature.]\r\n\r\nThe field coils vary in number and position. The purpose of their\r\nconstruction is always to send the largest possible number of lines of\r\nforce through the armature. Some dynamos are _bipolar_, or have _two_\r\npoles, others are multipolar or have more than two. In Fig. 288 No. 4\r\nhas four poles. The _armature_ of a dynamo differs from a magneto\r\narmature in that it consists of a series of coils of insulated copper\r\nwire wound in numerous slots cut in the surface of a cylindrical piece\r\nof iron. Fig. 289 shows a _side_ view of the iron core of such an\r\narmature. Iron is used to form the body of the armature since the\r\nmagnetic lines of force flow easily through the iron. The iron by its\r\npermeability also concentrates and increases the magnetic flux. The best\r\narmatures are made of many thin sheets of soft iron. These are called\r\n_laminated_ armatures. An armature made of a solid piece of iron becomes\r\nhot when revolving in a magnetic field. This is due to electric currents\r\ninduced in the iron itself. This heating is largely reduced by\r\n_laminating_ the armature. Why?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 290.--Armature connected to slip rings producing an\r\nalternating current.]\r\n\r\n=303. Methods of Collecting Current from the Armature.=--The electric\r\ncurrents produced in the armature are conducted away by _special sliding\r\ncontacts_. The stationary part of the sliding contact is called a\r\n_brush_. The moving part is a _slip ring_ or a _commutator_. Fig. 290\r\nshows an armature coil connected to slip rings. As the armature\r\nrevolves, the coils and slip rings revolve with it. The two ends of the\r\narmature coils are connected to the two rings respectively. Now as the\r\narmature revolves it cuts the lines of force first in one direction and\r\nthen in the other. This produces in the coils an E.M.F. first one way\r\nand then the other. This E.M.F. sets up a current which is conducted to\r\nthe outside circuits through the slip rings and brushes. Such a current\r\nwhich repeatedly reverses its direction is called an _alternating\r\ncurrent_. Fig. 291 (1) indicates graphically how the current moves\r\nalternately one way and then the other. Alternating currents are\r\nextensively used for electric _light, heat, and power_. _Direct\r\ncurrents_ or those going continuously in one direction are however in\r\nmuch demand especially for _street car service_, _for electrolysis_, and\r\nfor _charging storage batteries_.\r\n\r\n=304. The Commutator.=--For a dynamo to deliver a _direct current_ it\r\nmust carry upon the shaft of the armature a _commutator_. The commutator\r\nis used to _reverse_ the connections of the ends of the armature coils\r\nat the instant that the current changes its direction in the armature.\r\nThis reversal of connection when the direction of current changes, keeps\r\nthe current in the outside circuit flowing in the same direction. Fig.\r\n291 is a diagram of an armature with a commutator. The commutator is a\r\n_split ring_, having as many parts or _segments_ as there are coils upon\r\nthe armature. The brushes touch opposite points upon the commutator as\r\nthey slide over the surface of the latter. Suppose that the armature\r\nviewed from the commutator end rotates in a counter-clockwise direction,\r\nalso that the currents from the upper part move toward the commutator\r\nand out the top brush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 291.--The armature coils are connected to a\r\ncommutator producing a direct current.]\r\n\r\nAs the armature revolves, its coils soon begin to cut the force lines in\r\nthe opposite direction. This change in the direction of cutting the\r\nlines of force causes the current to reverse in the coils of the\r\narmature. At the instant the current changes in direction, what was the\r\nupper segment of the commutator slips over into contact with the lower\r\nbrush, and the other segment swings over to touch the upper brush. Since\r\nthe current has reversed in the coils it continues to flow out of the\r\nupper brush. This change in connection at the brushes takes place at\r\neach half turn of the armature, just as the current changes in direction\r\nin the coils. This is the manner in which the commutator of a dynamo\r\nchanges the alternating current produced in the armature coils, into a\r\ndirect current in the external circuit. Fig. 292 (1) represents\r\ngraphically an alternating current, (2) of the same figure shows current\r\ntaken from the brushes of the commutator of a dynamo with one coil on\r\nthe armature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 292.--Graphic representation of (1) an alternating\r\ncurrent; (2) a pulsating current; (3) a continuous current.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 293.--DeLaval multi-stage turbine and gear driving\r\n750-kw., 750-r.p.m., 600-volt direct-current generator.]\r\n\r\nA practical dynamo, however, has many coils upon its armature with a\r\ncorresponding number of segments upon the commutator. (See Figs. 289 and\r\n293.) As each coil and commutator segment passes a brush, it contributes\r\nan impulse to the current with the result that armatures with many coils\r\nproduce currents that flow quite evenly. (See Fig. 292, 3.)\r\n\r\nThe current represented in Fig. 292 (2) is called a _pulsating_ current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 294.--A wire carrying a current across a magnetic\r\nfield is pushed sideways by the field.]\r\n\r\n=305. The electric motor= is a machine which transforms the energy of an\r\nelectric current into mechanical energy or motion. The _direct current\r\nmotor_ consists of the same essential parts as a direct current dynamo,\r\nviz., the field magnet, armature, commutator and brushes. Its operation\r\nis readily comprehended after one understands the following experiment:\r\n\r\nSet up two bar electromagnets with unlike poles facing each other about\r\nan inch apart. A wire connected to a source of current is hung loosely\r\nbetween the poles as in Fig. 294. The circuit through the wire should\r\ncontain a key or switch. If a current is sent through the electromagnets\r\nand then another is sent through the wire, the latter will be found to\r\nbe pushed either up or down, while if the current is reversed through\r\nthe wire it is pushed in the opposite direction. These results may be\r\nexplained as follows:\r\n\r\nConsider the magnetic field about a wire carrying a current (See Fig.\r\n295.) If such a wire is placed in the magnetic field between two\r\nopposite poles of an electromagnet (Fig. 296), the wire will be moved\r\neither up or down. The reason for this is shown by the diagram in Fig.\r\n297. Here a wire carrying a current and therefore surrounded by a\r\nmagnetic field passes across another magnetic field. The two fields\r\naffect each other causing a crowding of the force lines either above or\r\nbelow the wire. The wire at once tends to move sideways across the field\r\naway from the crowded side. In the figure, the wire tends to move\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 295.--The magnetic field about a wire carrying a\r\ncurrent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 296.--The magnetic field between two unlike poles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 297.--The crowding of the lines of force above the\r\nwire, pushes it downward.]\r\n\r\nIn a practical motor, the wires upon the armature are so connected that\r\nthose upon one side (see Fig. 298), carry currents that pass in, while\r\non the other side they pass out. To represent the direction of the\r\ncurrent in the wires, the following device is employed; a circle with a\r\ncross (to represent the feather in the tail of an arrow) indicates a\r\ncurrent going away from the observer, while a circle with a dot at its\r\ncenter (to represent the tip of an arrow) indicates a current coming\r\ntoward the observer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 298.--The crowding of the lines of force causes the\r\narmature to revolve in a clockwise direction.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 298 the north pole is at the left and the south pole at the\r\nright. The field of the magnets therefore passes from left to right as\r\nindicated in the figure. Now in the armature the currents in the wires\r\non the left half of the armature are coming toward the observer while\r\nthose on the right move away. Applying the right-hand rule, the magnetic\r\nlines will crowd _under_ the wires on the left side of the armature\r\nwhile they will crowd _over_ the wires on the right side. This will\r\ncause a rotation up on the left side and down on the right, or in a\r\n_clockwise_ direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 299.--View of a one-half horse-power motor.]\r\n\r\nIf the current in the armature is reversed (in on the left and out on\r\nthe right), the lines of force will crowd the armature around in the\r\nopposite direction or _counter clockwise_. The rotation of the armature\r\nwill also be reversed if, while the current in the armature is unchanged\r\nin direction, the poles of the magnet are changed thus reversing the\r\nmagnetic field.\r\n\r\nThe motorman of a street car reverses the motion of his car by reversing\r\nthe direction of the current in the _armature_ of the motor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 300.--The frame and electromagnet (at left), front\r\nbracket and brush holder (at right) of the motor shown in Fig. 299.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 301.--The armature of a motor.]\r\n\r\n=306. Practical motors= have many coils upon the armature with a\r\ncorresponding number of segments upon the commutator. A large number of\r\ncoils and commutator segments enables some one of the coils to exert its\r\ngreatest efficiency at each instant, hence a steady force is provided\r\nfor turning the armature which causes it to run smoothly. Fig. 299\r\nrepresents a 1/2 horse-power motor ready for use while Fig. 300 shows\r\nthe frame and poles and the front bracket and brush holder, and Fig. 301\r\nrepresents the armature.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

The Induction Coil.=--Practically all electric currents are\r\nproduced either by voltaic cells or by dynamos. It is frequently found,\r\nhowever, that it is desirable to change the E.M.F. of the current used,\r\neither for purposes of _effectiveness_, _convenience_, _or economy_. The\r\n_induction coil_ and the _transformer_, devices for changing the E.M.F.\r\nof electric currents, are therefore in common use. _The induction coil_\r\n(see Fig. 302) consists of a _primary_ coil of coarse wire _P_ (Fig.\r\n303) wound upon a core of soft iron wire, and a _secondary_ coil, _S_,\r\nof several thousand turns of fine wire. In circuit with the primary coil\r\nis a battery, _B_, and a current interrupter, _K_, which works like the\r\ninterrupter upon an electric bell. The ends of the secondary coil are\r\nbrought to binding posts or spark points as at _D_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 302.--An induction coil.]\r\n\r\nThe current from the battery flows through the primary coil magnetizing\r\nthe iron core. The magnetism in the core attracts the soft-iron end of\r\nthe interrupter, drawing the latter over and breaking the circuit at the\r\nscrew contact, _K_. This abruptly stops the current and at once the core\r\nloses its magnetism. The spring support of the interrupter now draws the\r\nlatter back to the contact, _T_, again completing the circuit. The whole\r\noperation is repeated, the interrupter vibrating rapidly continually\r\nopening and closing the circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 303.--Diagram showing the parts of an induction\r\ncoil.]\r\n\r\n=308. The Production of Induced Currents in the Secondary Coil.=--When\r\nthe current flows through the _primary_ it sets up a magnetic field in\r\nthe _core_. When the current is interrupted, the field disappears. The\r\nincrease and decrease in the field of the core induces an E.M.F. in the\r\nsecondary coil, in accordance with the first law of electromagnetic\r\ninduction. The E.M.F. produced depends upon (a) the number of turns in\r\nthe secondary, (b) the strength of the magnetic field and (c) the rate\r\nof change of the field. The rate of change in the field is more rapid at\r\nthe break than at the make. When the circuit is closed it takes perhaps\r\n1/10 of a second for the current to build up to its full strength while\r\nat a break the current stops in perhaps 0.00001 of a second, so that the\r\ninduced E.M.F. is perhaps 10,000 times as great at \"break\" as at make.\r\nTo increase the suddenness of the \"make\" and \"break,\" a condenser is\r\noften connected in the primary circuit, in parallel, with the\r\ninterrupter. (See Fig. 303, _C._) This condenser provides a place to\r\nhold the rush of current at the instant that the interrupter breaks the\r\ncircuit. This stored up charge reinforces the current at the make\r\nproducing a much more sudden change in the magnetic field with a\r\ncorresponding increase in the E.M.F. The induced currents from induction\r\ncoils are sometimes called _faradic currents_ in honor of Faraday who\r\ndiscovered electromagnetic induction. They are used to operate sparking\r\ndevices upon gas and gasoline engines and in many devices and\r\nexperiments in which high-tension electricity is employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 304.--The transformer has a closed core; the\r\ninduction coil, an open core.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 305.--The laminated iron core of a transformer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 306.--Cross-section of the transformer shown in Fig.\r\n305 showing the magnetic field around the primary and secondary coils.]\r\n\r\n=309. The Transformer.=--This is like the induction coil in that it uses\r\na _primary_ and a _secondary_ coil, and an iron core to carry the\r\nmagnetic field. (See Fig. 304.) They differ in that the transformer has\r\na _closed_ core or one forming a continuous iron circuit, while the\r\ninduction coil has an _open_ core, or one in which the magnetic field\r\nmust travel in air from the north to the south poles of the core. The\r\ntransformer must always be used with an _alternating_ current while the\r\ninduction coil may use either a direct or an alternating current.\r\nFurther, the _induction_ coil always produces a higher E.M.F. while the\r\ntransformer may produce an E.M.F. in its secondary coil that is either\r\nhigher or lower than the one in the primary. The former is called\r\n\"_step-up_\" while the latter is a \"_step-down_\" transformer. The\r\nalternating current in the primary coil of the transformer produces an\r\n_alternating magnetic flux_ in the iron core. This iron core is\r\n_laminated_ (see Fig. 305) to prevent the heating that would result if a\r\nsolid core were used. The alternating magnetic flux induces in the\r\nsecondary coil an E.M.F. in accordance with the following rule. The\r\nratio of the _number_ of _turns_ in the _primary_ to the _number_ of the\r\n_turns_ in the _secondary_ coil equals the ratio of the electromotive\r\nforces in these respective coils. If the secondary coil has 8 turns\r\nwhile the primary has 4, the E.M.F. of the secondary will be just twice\r\nthat of the primary. Or, if in the primary coil of the transformer Fig.\r\n306 is an E.M.F. of 110 volts, in the secondary will be found an E.M.F.\r\nof 220 volts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 307.--A commercial transformer.]\r\n\r\n=310. Uses of Transformers.=--In electric lighting systems, dynamos\r\noften produce alternating currents at 1000 to 12,000 volts pressure. It\r\nis very dangerous to admit currents at this pressure into dwellings and\r\nbusiness houses, so that transformers are installed just outside of\r\nbuildings to \"step-down\" the high voltage currents to 110 or 220 volts.\r\nThe lighting current that enters a house does not come directly from a\r\ndynamo. It is an induced current produced by a transformer placed near\r\nthe house. (See Fig. 307.) In a perfect transformer the efficiency would\r\nbe 100 per cent. This signifies that the energy that is sent into the\r\nprimary coil of the transformer exactly equals the energy in the\r\nsecondary coil. The best transformers actually show efficiencies better\r\nthan 97 per cent. The lost energy appears as heat in the transformer.\r\n\"The transfer of great power in a large transformer from one circuit to\r\nanother circuit entirely separate and distinct, without any motion or\r\nnoise and almost without loss, is one of the most wonderful phenomena\r\nunder the control of man.\"\r\n\r\n=311. The mercury arc rectifier= is a device for changing an alternating\r\ncurrent into a direct current. It is frequently used for charging\r\nstorage batteries where only alternating current is supplied by the\r\nelectric power company. It consists of an exhausted bulb containing two\r\ncarbon or graphite electrodes marked _G_ in Fig. 308 and a mercury\r\nelectrode marked _M_. It is found that current will pass through such a\r\nbulb only from the graphite to the mercury but not in the reverse\r\ndirection. In operating the device, the secondary terminals of an\r\nalternating current transformer _T_ are connected to the graphite\r\nterminals of the rectifier. A wire connected to the center of the\r\nsecondary of the transformer at _C_ is attached to the _negative_\r\nterminal of the storage battery _SB_. The _positive_ terminal of the\r\nbattery is connected to the mercury electrode of the rectifier tube\r\nthrough a reactance or choke coil _R_. This coil serves to sustain the\r\narc between the alternations. _Sw_ is a starting switch, used only in\r\nstriking the arc. It is opened immediately after the tube begins to\r\nglow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 308.--Diagram of a mercury arc rectifier.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\nTransformer, induction coil, mercury arc rectifier, construction,\r\naction; uses of each.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1.

The Electric Telephone.=--This is an instrument for reproducing\r\nthe human voice at a distance by an electric current. The modern\r\nelectric telephone consists of at least four distinct parts (see Fig.\r\n312); viz., a _transmitter_, an induction coil, an electric battery, and\r\na _receiver_. The first three of these are concerned in sending, or\r\n_transmitting_ over the connecting wires a fluctuating electric current,\r\nwhich has been modified by the waves of a human voice. The receiver, is\r\naffected by the fluctuating current and reproduces the voice. It will be\r\nconsidered first, in our study.\r\n\r\n=313. The telephone receiver= was invented in 1876 by Alexander Graham\r\nBell. It consists of a permanent steel magnet, U shaped, with a coil of\r\nfine insulated copper wire about each pole. (See Fig. 310.) A disc of\r\nthin sheet iron is supported so that its center does not quite touch\r\nthe poles of the magnet. A hard rubber cap or ear piece with an opening\r\nat its center is screwed on so as to hold the iron disc firmly in place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 309.--The simplest telephone system. It consists of\r\ntwo telephone receivers connected in series on a circuit. It will work,\r\nbut not satisfactorily.]\r\n\r\n_The action of the receiver_ may be understood from the following\r\nexplanation: The electric current sent to the receiver, comes from the\r\nsecondary coil of the induction coil; it is an alternating current,\r\nfluctuating back and forth just in time with the waves of the voice\r\naffecting it at the transmitter. This alternating current flows around\r\nthe coils on the poles of the permanent magnet. When this current flows\r\nin one direction, its magnetic field assists the field of the permanent\r\nmagnet, strengthening it. This stronger magnetic field draws the thin\r\niron disc in front of the poles of the magnet a little closer to them.\r\nWhen the current in the coils flows the other way, its magnetic field\r\nweakens the field of the steel magnet, and the disc is drawn back by the\r\nforce of its own elasticity. Thus the disc of the receiver vibrates with\r\nthe alternations of the current, and reproduces the same sounds that\r\nwere spoken into the transmitter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 310.--A telephone receiver. This receiver has a\r\npermanent horseshoe magnet with a coil about each pole.]\r\n\r\n=314. The Telephone Transmitter.=--The telephone receiver just described\r\nhas great sensitiveness in reproducing sound, but it is not satisfactory\r\nas a transmitter or sending apparatus. The _transmitter_ commonly used\r\nis represented in cross-section in Fig. 311. In this figure, back of the\r\nmouthpiece, is a thin carbon disc, _D_. Back of this disc is a circular\r\ncompartment containing granular carbon, _g_. The wires of the circuit\r\nare connected to the carbon disc and to the back of the case containing\r\ngranular carbon. The circuit through the transmitter also includes a\r\nvoltaic or storage cell and the primary coil of an induction coil. (See\r\nFig. 312.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 311.--A telephone transmitter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 312.--Telephone instruments at one end of a talking\r\ncircuit.]\r\n\r\n=315. The action of the transmitter= is explained as follows: When the\r\nsound waves of the voice strike upon the carbon disc, the latter\r\nvibrates, alternately increasing and decreasing the pressure upon the\r\ngranular carbon. When the pressure _increases_, the electrical\r\nresistance of the granular carbon is _lessened_, and when the pressure\r\nupon it is _decreased_, its resistance _increases_. This changing\r\nresistance causes fluctuations in the electric current _that_ correspond\r\nexactly with the sound waves of the voice affecting it.\r\n\r\n=316. A complete telephone system= operating with a local battery is\r\nshown in Fig. 312. A person speaking into the transmitter causes a\r\nfluctuation in the electric current in the transmitter as described in\r\nArt. 315. This fluctuating current passes through the primary coil of\r\nthe induction coil _Ic_. This fluctuating current produces a fluctuating\r\nmagnetic field in its core. This fluctuating field induces an\r\n_alternating_ current in the secondary coil which alternates just as the\r\nprimary current fluctuates, but with a much higher E.M.F. than the\r\nlatter. The alternating current passes to the receiver which reproduces\r\nthe speech as described in Art. 313. The line circuit includes the\r\nsecondary of the induction coil, the receiving instrument and the\r\nreceiver of the sending instrument so that the voice is reproduced in\r\nboth receivers. An electric bell is placed at each station to call the\r\nattention of parties wanted. The movement of the receiver hook when the\r\nreceiver is lifted, disconnects the bell and closes the talking circuit.\r\nThe latter is opened and the bell connected when the receiver is hung up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 313.--Diagram of a telephone system as used in a\r\nlarge exchange.]\r\n\r\nIn cities and towns, the telephone system in use differs from the one\r\ndescribed in usually having one large battery placed in the central\r\nexchange, instead of dry cells at each instrument. (See Fig. 313.) Also\r\nthe operator at _central_ is called by simply taking the receiver from\r\nthe hook instead of being \"rung up\" by the subscriber. The operations of\r\nthe transmitter, induction coil and receiver, however, are the same in\r\nall telephones.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Receiver: parts, action.\r\n\r\n2.

What is a Sound?=--This question has two answers, which may be\r\nillustrated as follows: Suppose that an alarm clock is set so that it\r\nwill strike in one week and that it is placed upon a barren rock in the\r\nPacific Ocean by sailors who immediately sail away. If when the tapper\r\nstrikes the bell at the end of the week no ear is within a hundred\r\nmiles, is any sound produced? The two view-points are now made evident,\r\nfor some will answer \"no\" others \"yes.\" Those answering \"no\" hold that\r\nsound is a _sensation_ which would not be produced if no ear were at\r\nhand to be affected. Those answering \"yes\" understand, by the term\r\nsound, _a mode of motion capable of affecting the auditory nerves_, and\r\nthat sound exists wherever such motions are present. This latter point\r\nof view is called the _physical_ and is the one we are to use in this\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 314.--The tuning fork is vibrating.]\r\n\r\n=318. Source of Sound.=--If we trace any sound to its source, it will be\r\nfound to originate in a body in rapid motion usually in what is called a\r\nstate of _vibration_. To illustrate, take a tuning fork, strike it to\r\nset it in vibration and place its stem firmly against a thin piece of\r\nwood; the sound will be strengthened materially by the vibration of the\r\nwood. If now the vibrating fork is placed with the tips of the prongs in\r\nwater, the vibration is plainly shown by the spattering of the water\r\n(Fig. 314). When one _speaks_, the vibrating body is in the _larynx_ at\r\nthe top of the windpipe. Its vibration may be plainly felt by the hand\r\nplaced upon the throat while speaking.\r\n\r\n=319. Sound Media.=--Usually sounds reach the ear through the air. The\r\nair is then said to be a _medium for sound_. Other substances may serve\r\nas a sound medium, for if the head is under water and two stones, also\r\nunder water, are struck together a sharp sound is heard. Also if one end\r\nof a wooden rod is held at the ear and the other end of the rod is\r\nscratched by a pin, the sound is more plainly perceived through the wood\r\nthan through the air. Think of some illustration from your own\r\nexperience of a solid acting as medium for sound. If an electric bell is\r\nplaced in a bell jar attached to an air pump, as in Fig. 315, on\r\nexhausting the air the loudness of the sound is found to diminish,\r\nindicating that in a perfect vacuum no sound would be transmitted. This\r\neffect of a vacuum upon the transmission of sound is very different from\r\nits effect upon radiation of heat and light. Both heat and light are\r\nknown to pass through a vacuum since both come to the earth from the sun\r\nthrough space that so far as we know contains no air or other matter.\r\nSound differs from this in that it is always transmitted by some\r\nmaterial body and cannot exist in a vacuum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 315.--Sound does not travel in a vacuum.]\r\n\r\n=320. Speed of Sound.=--Everyone has noticed that it takes time for\r\nsound to travel from one place to another. If we see a gun fired at a\r\ndistance, the report is heard a few seconds after the smoke or flash is\r\nseen. The time elapsing between a flash of lightning and the thunder\r\nshows that sound takes time to move from one place to another. Careful\r\nexperiments to determine the speed of sound have been made. One method\r\nmeasures accurately the time required for the sound of a gun to pass\r\nbetween two stations several miles apart. A gun or cannon is placed at\r\neach station. These are fired alternately, first the one at one station\r\nand then the one at the other so as to avoid an error in computation due\r\nto the motion of wind. This mode of determining the speed of sound is\r\nnot accurate. Other methods, more refined than the one just described\r\nhave given accurate values for the speed of sound. The results of a\r\nnumber of experiments show that, at the freezing temperature, 0°C., the\r\nspeed of sound in air is 332 meters or 1090 ft. a second. The speed of\r\nsound in air is affected by the temperature, increasing 2 ft. or 0.6\r\nmeter per second for each degree that the temperature rises above 0°C.\r\nThe speed decreases the same amount for each degree C. that the air is\r\ncooled below the freezing point. The speed of sound in various\r\nsubstances has been carefully determined. It is greater in most of them\r\nthan in air. In water the speed is about 1400 meters a second; in wood,\r\nwhile its speed varies with different kinds, it averages about 4000\r\nmeters a second; in brass the speed is about 3500 meters; while in iron\r\nit is about 5100 meters a second.\r\n\r\n=321. The Nature of Sound.=--We have observed that sound originates at a\r\nvibrating body, that it requires a medium in order to be transmitted\r\nfrom one place to another, and that it travels at a definite speed in a\r\ngiven substance. Nothing has been said, however, of the _mode_ of\r\ntransmission, or of the _nature_ of _sound_. Sounds continue to come\r\nfrom an alarm clock even though it is placed under a bell jar. It is\r\ncertain that nothing material can pass through the glass of the jar.\r\nIf, however, we consider that _sound is transmitted by waves through\r\nsubstances_ the whole matter can be given a simple explanation. In order\r\nto better understand the nature of sound a study of waves and wave\r\nmotion will be taken up in the next section.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\nSound: two definitions, source, medium, speed, nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1. Give two illustrations from outside the laboratory of the fact that\r\nsound is transmitted by other materials than air.\r\n\r\n2. Name the vibrating part that is the source of the sound in three\r\ndifferent musical instruments.\r\n\r\n3. Is sound transmitted more strongly in solids, liquids or gases? How\r\ndo you explain this?\r\n\r\n4. How far away is a steamboat if the sound of its whistle is heard 10\r\nseconds after the steam is seen, the temperature being 20°C.? Compute in\r\nfeet and in meters.\r\n\r\n5. How many miles away is lightning if the thunder is heard 12 seconds\r\nafter the flash in seen, the temperature being 25°C.?\r\n\r\n6. Four seconds after a flash of lightning is seen the thunder clap is\r\nheard. The temperature is 90°F. How far away was the discharge?\r\n\r\n7. The report of a gun is heard 3 seconds after the puff of smoke is\r\nseen. How far away is the gun if the temperature is 20°C.?\r\n\r\n8. An explosion takes place 10 miles away. How long will it take the\r\nsound to reach you, the temperature being 80°F?. How long at 0°F.?\r\n\r\n9. How long after a whistle is sounded will it be heard if the distance\r\naway is 1/4 mile, the temperature being 90°F.?\r\n\r\n10. The report of an explosion of dynamite is heard 2 minutes after the\r\npuff of smoke is seen. How far away is the explosion the temperature\r\nbeing 77°F.?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) WAVES[N] AND WAVE MOTION\r\n\r\n  [N] A wave is a disturbance in a substance or medium that is\r\n  transmitted through it.\r\n\r\n=322. Visible Waves.=--It is best to begin the study of wave motion by\r\nconsidering some waves which are familiar to most persons. Take for\r\nexample the waves that move over the surface of water (Fig. 316). These\r\nhave an onward motion, yet boards or chips upon the surface simply rise\r\nand fall as the waves pass them. They are not carried onward by the\r\nwaves. The water surface simply rises and falls as the waves pass by.\r\nConsider also the waves that may be seen to move across a field of tall\r\ngrass or grain. Such waves are produced by the bending and rising of the\r\nstalks as the wind passes over them. Again, waves may be produced in a\r\nrope fastened at one end, by suddenly moving the other end up and down.\r\nThese waves move to the end of the rope where they are _reflected_ and\r\nreturn. The three types of waves just mentioned are illustrations of\r\n_transverse_ waves, the ideal case being that in which the particles\r\nmove at _right angles_ to the path or course of the wave. Such waves are\r\ntherefore called _transverse_ waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 316.--Water waves.]\r\n\r\n=323. Longitudinal waves.=--Another kind of wave is found in bodies that\r\nare elastic and compressible and have inertia, such as gases and coiled\r\nwire springs. Such waves may be studied by considering a wire spring as\r\nthe medium through which the waves pass. (See Fig. 318.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 317.--The compression wave travels through the\r\nspring.]\r\n\r\nIf the end of the wire spring shown in Fig. 317 is struck the first few\r\nturns of the spring will be compressed. Since the spring possesses\r\nelasticity, the turns will move forward a little and compress those\r\nahead, these will press the next in turn and so on. Thus a _compression_\r\nwave will move to the end of the spring, where it will be reflected and\r\nreturn. Consider the turns of the spring as they move toward the end.\r\nOn account of their _inertia_ they will continue moving until they have\r\nseparated from each other _more_ than at first, before returning to\r\ntheir usual position. This condition of a greater separation of the\r\nturns of the spring than usual is called a _rarefaction_. It moves along\r\nthe spring following the wave of compression. The condensation and\r\nrarefaction are considered as together forming a complete wave. Since\r\nthe turns of wire move back and forth in a direction parallel to that in\r\nwhich the wave is traveling, these waves are called _longitudinal_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 318.--Longitudinal waves (1) in a spring, (2) in\r\nair, and (3) graphic representation showing wave length, condensations,\r\nand rarefactions.]\r\n\r\n=324. The transmission of a sound by the air= may be understood by\r\ncomparing it with the process by which a _wave is transmitted by a wire\r\nspring_. Consider a light spring (Fig. 318, 1) attached at the end of a\r\nvibrating tuning fork, _K_, and also to a diaphragm, _D_. Each vibration\r\nof the fork will first compress and then separate the coils of the\r\nspring. These impulses will be transmitted by the spring as described in\r\nArt. 315, and cause the diaphragm to vibrate _at the same rate_ as the\r\ntuning fork. The diaphragm will then give out a sound similar to that of\r\nthe tuning fork. Suppose that the spring is replaced by air, and the\r\ndiaphragm, by the ear of a person, _E_, (Fig. 318, 2.) when the prong\r\nof the fork moves toward the ear it starts a compression and when it\r\nmoves back a rarefaction. The fork continues vibrating and these\r\nimpulses move onward like those in the spring at a speed of about 1120\r\nft. in a second. They strike the diaphragm of the ear causing it to move\r\nback and forth or to vibrate at the same rate as the tuning fork, just\r\nas in the case of the diaphragm attached to the spring.\r\n\r\n=325. Graphic Representation of Sound waves.=--It is frequently\r\ndesirable to represent sound waves graphically. The usual method is to\r\nuse a curve like that in (Fig. 318, 3). This curve is considered as\r\nrepresenting a train of waves moving in the same direction as those in\r\nFig. 318 1 and 2, and also having the same length. The part of the wave\r\n_A-B_ represents a condensation of the sound wave and the part _B-C_\r\nrepresents a rarefaction. A complete wave consisting of a condensation\r\nand a rarefaction is represented by that portion of the curve _A-C_. The\r\nportion of the curve _B-D_ also represents a _full wave length_ as the\r\nlatter is defined as _the distance between two corresponding parts of\r\nthe adjacent waves_. The curve, Fig. (318, 3) represents not only the\r\nwave length, but also the height of the wave or the amount of movement\r\nof the particles along the wave. This is called the _amplitude_ and is\r\nindicated by the distance _A-b_. Since the _loudness_ or intensity of a\r\nsound is found to depend upon the amount of movement of the particles\r\nalong the wave, the _amplitude_ of the curve is used to indicate the\r\nloudness of the sound represented. All of the characteristics of a sound\r\nwave may be graphically represented by curves. Such curves will be used\r\nfrequently as an aid in explaining the phenomena of wave motion both in\r\nsound and in light.\r\n\r\n=326. Reflections of Sound.=--It is found that a wave moving along a\r\nwire spring is reflected when it reaches the end and returns along the\r\nspring. Similarly a sound wave in air is reflected upon striking the\r\nsurface of a body. If the wave strikes perpendicularly it returns along\r\nthe line from which it comes, if, however, it strikes at some other\r\nangle it does not return along the same line, but as in other cases of\r\nreflected motion, the _direction_ of the _reflected_ wave is described\r\nby the _Law of Reflected Motion_ as follows: _The angle of reflection is\r\nalways equal to the angle of incidence_. This law is illustrated in Fig.\r\n319. Suppose that a series of waves coming from a source of sound move\r\nfrom _H_ to _O_. After striking the surface _IJ_ the waves are reflected\r\nand move toward _L_ along the line _OL_. Let _PO_ be perpendicular to\r\nthe surface _IJ_ at _O_. Then _HOP_ is _the angle_ of incidence and\r\n_LOP_ is the _angle of reflection_. By the law of reflected motion these\r\nangles are equal. In an ordinary room when a person speaks the sound\r\nwaves reflected from the smooth walls reinforce the sound waves moving\r\ndirectly to the hearers. It is for this reason that it is usually easier\r\nto speak in at room than in the open air. Other illustrations of the\r\nreinforcement of sound by reflection are often seen. Thus an _ear\r\ntrumpet_ (Fig. 320), uses the principle of reflection and concentration\r\nof sound. So-called _sounding boards_ are sometimes placed back of\r\nspeakers in large halls to reflect sound waves to the audience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 319.--Law of reflection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 320.--An ear trumpet.]\r\n\r\n=327. Echoes.=--_An echo is the repetition of a sound caused by its\r\nreflection from some distant surface_ such as that of a building, cliff,\r\nclouds, trees, etc. The interval of time between the production of a\r\nsound and the perception of its echo is the time that the sound takes to\r\ntravel from its source to the reflecting body and back to the listener.\r\nExperiments have shown that the sensation of a sound persists about\r\none-tenth of a second. Since the velocity of sound at 20°C. is about\r\n1130 ft. per second, during one-tenth of a second the sound wave will\r\ntravel some 113 ft. If the reflecting surface is about 56 ft. distant a\r\n_short_ sound will be followed immediately by its echo as it is heard\r\none-tenth of a second after the original sound. The reflected sound\r\ntends to strengthen the original one if the reflecting surface is less\r\nthan 56 ft. away. If the distance of the reflecting surface is much more\r\nthan 56 ft. however, the reflected sound does not blend with the\r\noriginal one but forms a distinct echo. The echoes in large halls\r\nespecially those with large smooth walls may very seriously affect the\r\nclear perception of the sound. Such rooms are said to have poor\r\n_acoustic_ properties. Furniture, drapery, and carpets help to deaden\r\nthe echo because of diffused reflection. The Mormon Tabernacle at Salt\r\nLake City, Utah, is a fine example of a building in which the reflecting\r\nsurfaces of the walls and ceiling are of such shape and material that\r\nits acoustic properties are remarkable, a pin dropped at one end being\r\nplainly heard at the other end about 200 ft. away.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Waves: transverse, longitudinal; wave length, condensation,\r\nrarefaction.\r\n\r\n2. Wave motion: in coiled spring, in air, on water.\r\n\r\n3. Reflection of waves: law, echoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1. A hunter hears an echo in 8 seconds after firing his gun. How far is\r\nthe reflecting surface if the temperature is 20°C.?\r\n\r\n2. How far is the reflecting surface of a building if the echo of one's\r\nfootsteps returns in 1 second at 10°C.?\r\n\r\n3. Why is it easier to speak or sing in a room than out of doors?\r\n\r\n4. Draw a curve that represents wave motion. Make it exactly three full\r\nwave lengths, and state why your curve shows this length. Indicate the\r\nparts of the curve that correspond to a condensation and to a\r\nrarefaction.\r\n\r\n5. How long does it take the sound of the \"pin drop\" to reach a person\r\nat the farther end of the building mentioned at the end of Art. 327?\r\n\r\n6. An echo is heard after 6 seconds. How far away is the reflecting\r\nsurface, the temperature being 70°F.?\r\n\r\n7. Why are outdoor band-stands generally made with the back curving over\r\nthe band?\r\n\r\n8. A man near a forest calls to a friend. In 4 seconds the echo comes\r\nback. How far away is he from the forest?\r\n\r\n9. Would it be possible for us ever to hear a great explosion upon the\r\nmoon? Explain.\r\n\r\n10. If a sunset gun was fired exactly at 6:00 P.M. at a fort, at what\r\ntime was the report heard by a man 25 miles away, if the temperature was\r\n10°C.?\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) INTENSITY AND PITCH OF SOUNDS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 321.--Graphic representations of (_a_) a noise,\r\n(_b_) a musical sound.]\r\n\r\n=328. Musical Sounds and Noises Distinguished.=--The question is\r\nsometimes raised, what is the difference between a _noise_ and a\r\n_musical sound_? The latter has been found to be produced by an even and\r\nregular vibration such as that of a tuning fork or of a piano string. A\r\nnoise on the other hand is characterized by sudden or irregular\r\nvibrations such as those produced by a wagon bumping over a stony\r\nstreet. These differences may be represented graphically as in Fig. 321,\r\n(a) represents a noise, (b) a musical tone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 322.--Curve _b_ represents a tone of greater\r\nintensity.]\r\n\r\n=329. Characteristics of Musical Sounds.=--Musical tones differ from one\r\nanother in three ways or are said to have _three characteristics_, viz.,\r\n_intensity_, _pitch_, and _quality_. Thus two sounds may differ only in\r\nintensity or _loudness_, that is, be alike in all other respects except\r\nthis one, as when a string of a piano is struck at first gently, and\r\nagain harder. The second sound is recognized as being louder. The\r\ndifference is due to the greater _amplitude_ of vibration caused by more\r\nenergy being used. Fig. 322 shows these differences graphically. Curve\r\n_b_ represents the tone of greater intensity or loudness, since its\r\namplitude of vibration is represented as being greater.\r\n\r\n=330. Conditions Affecting the Intensity of Sound.=--The intensity of\r\nsounds is also affected by the _area_ of the vibrating body. This is\r\nshown by setting a tuning fork in vibration. The area of the vibrating\r\npart being small, the sound is heard but a short distance from the fork.\r\nIf, however, the stem of the vibrating fork is pressed against the panel\r\nof a door or the top of a box, the sound may be heard throughout a room.\r\nThe stem of the fork has communicated its vibrations to the wood. The\r\nvibrating area, being greater, the sound is thereby much increased in\r\nintensity, producing a wave of greater amplitude. The same principle is\r\nemployed in the sounding boards of musical instruments as in the piano,\r\nviolin, etc. It is a common observation that sounds decrease in\r\nloudness as the distance from the source increases. This is due to the\r\nincrease of the surface of the spherical sound waves spreading in all\r\ndirections from the source. Careful experiments have shown that in a\r\nuniform medium _the intensity of a sound is inversely proportional to\r\nthe square of the distance from its source_. If a sound is confined so\r\nthat it cannot spread, such as the sound moving through a speaking tube,\r\nit maintains its intensity for a considerable distance. An _ear trumpet_\r\n(see Fig. 320) also applies this principle. It is constructed so that\r\nsound from a given area is _concentrated_ by reflection to a much\r\nsmaller area with a corresponding increase in intensity. The _megaphone_\r\n(Fig. 323), and the _speaking trumpet_ start the sound waves of the\r\nvoice in one direction so that they are kept from spreading widely,\r\nconsequently by its use the voice may be heard several times the usual\r\ndistance. The intensity of a sound is also affected by the _density_ of\r\nthe transmitting medium. Thus a sound produced on a mountain top is\r\nfainter and thinner than one produced in a valley. The sound of a bell\r\nin the receiver of an air pump becomes weaker as the air is exhausted\r\nfrom the latter. _Four_ factors thus influence the intensity of a sound,\r\nthe _area_ of the vibrating body, its _amplitude_ of vibration, the\r\n_distance_ of the source and the _density_ of the transmitting medium.\r\nIt is well to fix in mind the precise effect of each of these factors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 323.--The megaphone.]\r\n\r\n=331. Pitch.=--The most characteristic difference between musical sounds\r\nis that of _pitch_. Some sounds have a high pitch, such as those\r\nproduced by many insects and birds. Others have a low pitch as the notes\r\nof a bass drum or the sound of thunder. How notes of different pitch\r\nare produced may be shown by the siren (Fig. 324). This is a disc\r\nmounted so as to be rotated on an axis. Several rows of holes are\r\ndrilled in it in concentric circles. The number of holes in successive\r\nrows increases from within outward. If when the siren is rapidly rotated\r\nair is blown through a tube against a row of holes a clear musical tone\r\nis heard. The tone is due to the succession of pulses in the air\r\nproduced by the row of holes in the rotating disc alternately cutting\r\noff and permitting the air blast to pass through at very short\r\nintervals. If the blast is directed against a row of holes nearer the\r\ncircumference the pitch is higher, if against a row nearer the center\r\nthe pitch is lower. Or if the blast is sent against the same row of\r\nholes the pitch rises when the speed increases and lowers when the speed\r\nlessens. These facts indicate that the pitch of a tone is due to the\r\nnumber of pulses or vibrations that strike the ear each second; also\r\nthat _the greater the rate of vibration, the higher the pitch_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 324.--A siren.]\r\n\r\n=332. The Major Scale.=--If a siren is made with eight rows of holes, it\r\nmay indicate the relation between the notes of a _major scale_. To\r\naccomplish this, the number of holes in the successive rows should be\r\n24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48. If a disc so constructed is rapidly\r\nrotated at a uniform rate, a blast of air sent against all of the rows\r\nin succession produces the tones of the scale. These facts indicate that\r\nthe relative vibration numbers of the notes of any _major scale_ have\r\nthe same relation as the numbers 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48.\r\n\r\nThe note called middle C is considered by physicists as having 256\r\nvibrations a second. This would give the following _actual vibration_\r\nnumbers to the remaining notes of the major scale that begins with\r\n\"Middle C\" D.-288, E.-320, F.-341.3, G.-384, A.-426.6, B.-480, C'.-512.\r\nMusicians, however, usually make use of a scale of slightly higher\r\npitch. The _international_ standard of pitch in this country and in\r\nEurope is that in which \"A\" has 435 vibrations per second. This\r\ncorresponds to 261 vibrations for middle C.\r\n\r\n=333. The Relation between Speed, Wave Length, and Number of Vibrations\r\nper Second.=--Since the notes from the various musical instruments of an\r\norchestra are noticed to harmonize as well at a distance as at the place\r\nproduced, it is evident that notes of all pitches travel at the same\r\nrate, or have the _same speed_. Notes of high pitch, having a high\r\nvibration rate produce more waves in a second than notes of low pitch,\r\nconsequently the former are shorter than the latter. The following\r\nformula gives the relation between the speed (_v_), wave length (_l_),\r\nand number of vibrations per sec. (_n_):\r\n\r\n     _v_ = _l_ × _n_, or _l_ = _v/n_\r\n\r\nthat is, _the speed of a sound wave is equal to the number of vibrations\r\nper second times the wave length, or the wave length is equal to the\r\nspeed divided by the number of vibrations per second_. This formula may\r\nalso be employed to find the _number_ of vibrations when the wave length\r\nand speed are given.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Compute in feet and centimeters.\r\n\r\n4. At what temperature will sound waves in air in unison with \"Middle C\"\r\nbe exactly 4 ft. long?\r\n\r\n5. Explain the use of a megaphone.\r\n\r\n6. What tone has waves 3 ft. long at 25°C.?\r\n\r\n7. What is the purpose of the \"sounding board\" of a piano?\r\n\r\n8. Two men are distant 1000 and 3000 ft. respectively from a fog horn.\r\nWhat is the relative intensity of the sounds heard by the two men?\r\n\r\n9. The speaking tone of the average man's voice has 160 vibrations per\r\nsecond. How long are the waves produced by him at 20°C.?\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) MUSICAL SCALES AND RESONANCE\r\n\r\n=334. A musical interval= _refers to the ratio between the pitches[O] of\r\ntwo notes_ as indicated by the results of the siren experiment. The\r\nsimplest interval, or ratio between two notes is the _octave_, C':C, or\r\n2:1 (48:24). Other important intervals with the corresponding ratios are\r\nthe _fifth_, G:C, or 3:2 (36:24); the _sixth_, A:C, or 5:3 (40:24); the\r\n_fourth_, F:C, 4:3 (32:24); the _major third_, E:C, or 5:4 (30:24); and\r\nthe _minor third_, G:E, 6:5. The interval between any two notes may be\r\ndetermined by finding the ratio between the vibration numbers of the two\r\nnotes. Thus, if one note is produced by 600 vibrations a second and\r\nanother by 400, the interval is 3:2, or a _fifth_, and this would be\r\nrecognized by a musician who heard the notes sounded together or one\r\nafter the other. Below is a table of musical nomenclatures, showing\r\nvarious relations between the notes of the major scale.\r\n\r\n  [O] Pitch as used here, means _vibration rate_.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF MUSICAL NOMENCLATURES\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+---+------+------+------+------+------+-------+----\r\n        Name of note   | C |  D   |  E   |  F   |  G   |  A   |   B   | C´\r\n  ---------------------+---+----- +----- +------+------+------+-------+----\r\n  Frequency in terms of|_n_|9/8_n_|5/4_n_|4/3_n_|3/2_n_|5/3_n_|15/8_n_|2_n_\r\n   \"do\"                |   |      |      |      |      |      |       |\r\n  ---------------------+---+--+---+--+---+--+---+--+---+--+---+---+---+----\r\n  Intervals            |  9/8 | 10/9 | 16/15|  9/8 | 10/9 |  9/8  | 16/15\r\n  ---------------------+---+--+---+--+---+--+---+--+---+--+---+---+---+----\r\n  Name of note in vocal|do |  re  |  mi  |  fa  | sol  | la   |  ti   | do\r\n   music               |   |      |      |      |      |      |       |\r\n  ---------------------+---+------+------+------+------+------+-------+----\r\n  Treble clef.\r\n  [Music]\r\n\r\n  Bass clef.\r\n  [Music]\r\n  ---------------------+---+------+------+------+------+------+-------+----\r\n  International pitch  |   |      |      |      |      |      |       |\r\n  of treble clef       |261| 293.6| 326.3| 348. | 391.5| 435  | 489.4 | 522\r\n  ---------------------+---+------+------+------+------+------+-------+----\r\n  Scientific scale     |256| 288  | 320  | 341.3| 384  | 426.6| 480   | 512\r\n  ---------------------+---+------+------+------+------+------+-------+----\r\n  Relative vibration   | 24|  27  |  30  |  32  |  36  |  40  |  45   |  48\r\n  numbers              |   |      |      |      |      |      |       |\r\n  ---------------------+---+------+------+------+------+------+-------+----\r\n\r\n=335. Major and Minor Triads.=--The notes C, E, G (_do_, _mi_, _sol_)\r\nform what is called a _major triad_. The _relative vibration numbers_\r\ncorresponding are 24, 30, 36. These in simplest terms have ratios of\r\n4:5:6. Any three other tones with vibration ratios of 4:5:6 will also\r\nform a major triad. If the octave of the lower tone is added, the four\r\nmake a major chord. Thus: F, A, C´ (_fa_, _la_, _do_), 32:40:48, or\r\n4:5:6, also form a major triad as do G, B, D´ (_sol_, _ti_, _re_),\r\n36:45:54, or 4:5:6. Inspection will show that these three major triads\r\ncomprise all of the tones of the major scale D´ being the octave of D.\r\nIt is, therefore, said that the major scale is based, or built, upon\r\nthese three major triads. The examples just given indicate the\r\nmathematical basis for harmony in music. Three notes having vibration\r\nratios of 10:12:15 are called _minor triads_. These produce a less\r\npleasing effect than those having ratios of 4:5:6.\r\n\r\n=336. The Need for Sharps and Flats.=--We have considered the key of C.\r\nThis is represented upon the piano or organ by white keys only (Fig.\r\n325). Now in order (a) to give variety to instrumental selections, and\r\n(b) to accommodate instruments to the range of the human voice, it has\r\nbeen necessary to introduce other notes in musical instruments. These\r\nare represented by the _black keys_ upon the piano and organ and are\r\nknown as _sharps_ and _flats_. To illustrate the necessity for these\r\nadditional notes take the major scale starting with B. This will give\r\nvibration frequencies of 240, 270, 300, 320, 360, 400, 450, and 480. The\r\nonly white keys that may be used with this scale are E 320 and B 480\r\nvibrations. Since the second note on this scale requires 270 vibrations\r\nabout halfway between C and D the black key C sharp is inserted. Other\r\nnotes must be inserted between D and E (D sharp), between F and G (F\r\nsharp), also G and A sharps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 325.--Section of a piano keyboard.]\r\n\r\n=337. Tempered Scales.=--In musical instruments with fixed notes, such\r\nas the harp, organ, or piano, complications were early recognized when\r\nan attempt was made to adapt these instruments so that they could be\r\nplayed in all keys. For the vibration numbers that would give a perfect\r\nmajor scale starting at C are not the same as will give a perfect major\r\nscale beginning with any other key. In using the various notes as the\r\nkeynote for a major scale, 72 different notes in the octave would be\r\nrequired. This would make it more difficult for such instruments as the\r\npiano to be played. To avoid these complications as much as possible, it\r\nhas been found necessary to abandon the simple ratios between successive\r\nnotes and to substitute another ratio in order that the vibration ratio\r\nbetween any two successive notes will be equal in every case. The\r\ndifferences between semitones are abolished so that, for example, C\r\nsharp and D flat become the same tone instead of two different tones.\r\nSuch a scale is called a _tempered scale_. The tempered scale has 13\r\nnotes to the octave, with 12 equal intervals, the ratio between two\r\nsuccessive notes being the ¹²√2 or 1.059. That is, any vibration rate on\r\nthe tempered scale may be computed by multiplying the vibration rate of\r\nthe preceding note by 1.059. While this is a necessary arrangement,\r\nthere is some loss in perfect harmony. It is for this reason that a\r\nquartette or chorus of voices singing without accompaniment is often\r\nmore harmonious and satisfactory than when accompanied with an\r\ninstrument of fixed notes as the piano, since the simple harmonious\r\nratios may be employed when the voices are alone. The imperfection\r\nintroduced by _equal temperament tuning_ is illustrated by the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n                      C      D     E       F     G       A      B      C\r\n  Perfect Scale of C 256.0  288.0  320.0  341.3  384.0  426.6  480.0  512.0\r\n  Tempered Scale     256.0  287.3  322.5  341.7  383.6  430.5  483.3  512.0\r\n\r\n=338. Resonance.=--If two tuning forks of the same pitch are placed near\r\neach other, and one is set vibrating, the other will soon be found to be\r\nin vibration. This result is said to be due to _sympathetic vibration_,\r\nand is an example of _resonance_ (Fig. 326). If water is poured into a\r\nglass tube while a vibrating tuning fork is held over its top, when the\r\nair column has a certain length it will start vibrating, reinforcing\r\nstrongly the sound of the tuning fork. (See Fig. 327.) This is also an\r\nexample of resonance. These and other similar facts indicate that _sound\r\nwaves started by a vibrating body will cause another body near it to\r\nstart vibrating if the two have the same rate of vibration_. Most\r\npersons will recall illustrations of this effect from their own\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 326.--One tuning fork will vibrate in sympathy with\r\nthe other, if they have exactly equal rates of vibration.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 327.--An air column of the proper length reinforces\r\nthe sound of the tuning fork.]\r\n\r\n=339. Sympathetic vibration= is explained as follows: Sound waves\r\nproduce very slight motions in objects affected by them; if the\r\nvibration of a given body is exactly in time with the vibrations of a\r\ngiven sound each impulse of the sound wave will strike the body so as to\r\nincrease the vibratory motion of the latter. This action continuing, the\r\nbody soon acquires a motion sufficient to produce audible waves. A good\r\nillustration of sympathetic vibration is furnished by the bell ringer,\r\nwho times his pulls upon the bell rope with the vibration rate of the\r\nswing of the bell. In the case of the resonant air column over which is\r\nheld a vibrating tuning fork (see Fig. 328), when the prong of the fork\r\nstarts downward from 1 to 2, a condensation wave moves down to the water\r\nsurface and back just in time to join the condensation wave _above_ the\r\nfork as the prong begins to move from 2 to 1; also when the prong\r\nstarts upward from 2 to 1, the rarefaction produced under it moves to\r\nthe bottom of the air column and back so as to join the rarefaction\r\n_above_ the fork as the prong returns. While the prong is making a\r\n_single_ movement, up or down, it is plain that the air wave moves twice\r\nthe length of the open tube. During a _complete_ vibration of the fork,\r\ntherefore, the sound wave moves four times the length of the air column.\r\nIn free air, the sound progresses a wave length during a complete\r\nvibration, hence the resonant air column is one-fourth the length of the\r\nsound wave to which it responds. Experiments with tubes cf different\r\nlengths show that the diameter of the air column has some effect upon\r\nthe length giving best resonance. About 25 per cent. of the diameter of\r\nthe tube must be added to the length of the air column to make it just\r\none-fourth the wave length. The sound heard in seashells and in other\r\nhollow bodies is due to resonance. Vibrations in the air too feeble to\r\naffect the ear are intensified by sympathetic vibration until they can\r\nbe heard. A tuning fork is often mounted upon a box called a\r\n_resonator_, which contains an air column of such dimensions that it\r\nreinforces the sound of the fork's sympathetic vibration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 328.--Explanation of resonance.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

What is the length of the sound waves produced?\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) WAVE INTERFERENCE, BEATS, VIBRATION OF STRINGS\r\n\r\n=340. Interference of waves.=--The possibility of two trains of waves\r\ncombining so as to produce a reduced motion or a _complete destruction_\r\nof motion may be shown graphically. Suppose two trains of waves of equal\r\nwave length and amplitude as in Fig. 329 meet in _opposite phases_. That\r\nis, the parts corresponding to the _crests_ of _A_ coincide with the\r\n_troughs_ of _B_, also the troughs of _A_ with the crests of _B_; when\r\nthis condition obtains, the result is that shown at _C_, the union of\r\nthe two waves resulting in complete destruction of motion. _The more or\r\nless complete destruction of one train of waves by another similar train\r\nis an illustration of_ =interference=. If two sets of water waves so\r\nunite as to entirely destroy each other the result is a level water\r\nsurface. If two trains of sound waves combine they may so interfere that\r\nsilence results. The conditions for securing interference of sound waves\r\nmay readily be secured by using a tuning fork and a resonating air\r\ncolumn. If the tuning fork is set vibrating and placed over the open end\r\nof the resonating air column (see Fig. 328), an increase in the sound\r\nthrough resonance may be heard. If the fork is rotated about its axis,\r\nin some positions no sound is heard while in other positions the sound\r\nis strongly reinforced. Similar effects may be perceived by holding a\r\nvibrating fork near the ear and slowly rotating as before. In some\r\npositions interference results while in other positions the sound is\r\nplainly heard. The explanation of interference may be made clear by the\r\nuse of a diagram. (See Fig. 330.) Let us imagine that we are looking at\r\nthe two square ends of a tuning fork. When the fork is vibrating the two\r\nprongs approach each other and then recede. As they approach, a\r\ncondensation is produced at 2 and rarefactions at 1 and 3. As they\r\nseparate, a rarefaction is produced at 2 and condensations at 1 and 3.\r\nNow along the lines at which the simultaneously produced rarefactions\r\nand condensations meet there is more or less complete interference. (See\r\nFig. 331.) These positions have been indicated by dotted lines extending\r\nthrough the ends of the prongs. As indicated above, these positions may\r\nbe easily found by rotating a vibrating fork over a resonant air column,\r\nor near the ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 329.--Interference of sound waves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 330.--At 2 is a condensation; at 1 and 3 are\r\nrarefactions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 331.--The condensations and rarefactions meet along\r\nthe dotted lines producing silence.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 332.--Diagram illustrating the formations of beats.]\r\n\r\n=341. Beats.=--If two tuning forks of slightly different pitch are set\r\nvibrating and placed over resonating air columns or with the stem of\r\neach fork upon a sounding board, so that the sounds may be intensified,\r\na peculiar pulsation of the sound may be noticed. This phenomenon is\r\nknown as _beats_. Its production may be easily understood by considering\r\na diagram (Fig. 332). Let the curve _A_ represent the sound wave sent\r\nout by one tuning fork and _B_, that sent out by the other. _C_\r\nrepresents the effect produced by the combination of these waves. At _R_\r\nthe two sound waves meet in the _same phase_ and reinforce each other.\r\nThis results in a louder sound than either produces alone. Now since the\r\nsounds are of slightly different pitch, one fork sends out a few more\r\nvibrations per second than the other. The waves from the first fork are\r\ntherefore a little shorter than those from the other. Consequently,\r\nalthough the two waves are at one time in the _same_ phase, they must\r\nsoon be in opposite phases as at _I_. Here interference occurs, and\r\nsilence results. Immediately the waves reinforce, producing a louder\r\nsound and so on alternately. The resulting rise and fall of the sound\r\nare known as _beats_. The number of beats per second must, of course, be\r\nthe same as the difference between the numbers of vibrations per second\r\nof the two sounds. One effect of beats is _discord_. This is especially\r\nnoticeable when the number of beats per second is between 30 and 120.\r\nStrike the two lowest notes on a piano at the same time. The beats are\r\nvery noticeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 333.--Turkish cymbals.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 334.--The cornet.]\r\n\r\n=342. Three Classes of Musical Instruments.=--There are three classes or\r\ngroups of musical instruments, if we consider the vibrating body that\r\nproduces the sound in each: (A) Those in which the sound is produced by\r\na vibrating _plate_ or _membrane_, as the drum, cymbals (Fig. 333),\r\netc.; (B) those with vibrating _air columns_, as the flute, pipe organ,\r\nand cornet (Fig. 334), and (C) with vibrating _wires_ or _strings_, as\r\nthe piano, violin, and guitar. It is worth while to consider some of\r\nthese carefully. We will begin with a consideration of vibrating wires\r\nand strings, these often producing tones of rich quality.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the strings of a piano. (If possible, look at the\r\nstrings in some instrument.) The range of the piano is 7-1/3 octaves.\r\nIts lowest note, A_{4}, has about 27 vibrations per second. Its highest,\r\nC⁴, about 4176. This great range in vibration rate is secured by varying\r\nthe length, the tension, and the diameter of the strings.\r\n\r\n=343. The Laws of Vibrating Strings.=--The relations between the\r\nvibration rate, the length, the tension and the diameter, of vibrating\r\nstrings have been carefully studied with an instrument called a\r\n_sonometer_ (Fig. 335). By this device it is found that the pitch of a\r\nvibrating string is raised one octave when its vibrating length is\r\nreduced to one-half. By determining the vibration rate of many lengths,\r\nthe following law has been derived: (Law I) _The rate of vibration of a\r\nstring is inversely proportional to its length._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 335.--A sonometer.]\r\n\r\nCareful tests upon the change of vibration rate produced by a change of\r\n_tension_ or pull upon the strings show that if the pull is increased\r\nfour times its vibrations rate is _doubled_, and if it is increased nine\r\ntimes its rate is tripled, that is: (Law II) _The vibration rates of\r\nstrings are directly proportional to the square roots of their\r\ntensions._\r\n\r\nTests of the effects of diameter are made by taking wires of equal\r\nlength and tension and of the same material but of different diameter.\r\nSuppose one is twice as thick as the other. This string has a tone an\r\noctave lower or vibrates one-half as fast as the first. Therefore: (Law\r\nIII) _The vibration rates of strings are inversely proportional to the\r\ndiameters._ These laws may be expressed by a formula _n_ ∝√(_t_)/_dl_.\r\n\r\nThe vibration of a string is rarely a simple matter. It usually vibrates\r\nin parts at the same time that it is vibrating as a whole. The tone\r\nproduced by a string vibrating as a whole is called its _fundamental_.\r\nThe vibrating parts of a string are called _loops_ or _segments_ (see\r\nFig. 336), while the points of least or no vibration are _nodes_.\r\nSegments are often called _antinodes_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 336.--A string yielding its fundamental and its\r\nfirst overtone.]\r\n\r\n=344. Overtones.=--The _quality_ of the tone produced by a vibrating\r\nstring is affected by its vibration in parts when it is also vibrating\r\nas a whole. (See Fig. 336.) The tones produced by the vibration in parts\r\nare called _overtones_ or _partial_ tones. The presence of these\r\novertones may often be detected by the sympathetic vibration of other\r\nwires near-by. What is called the _first_ overtone is produced by a\r\nstring vibrating in _two_ parts, the _second_ overtone by a string\r\nvibrating in _three parts_, the _third_ overtone by its vibration in\r\n_four_ parts and so on. In any overtone, the number of the parts or\r\nvibrating segments of the string is one more than the number of the\r\novertone. For example, gently press down the key of middle C of a piano.\r\nThis will leave the string free to vibrate. Now strongly strike the C an\r\noctave lower and then remove the finger from this key. The middle C\r\nstring will be heard giving its tone. In like manner try E¹ and G¹,\r\nwith C. This experiment shows that the sound of the C string contains\r\nthese tones as overtones. It also illustrates sympathetic vibration.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Interference, beats, production, effects.\r\n\r\n2. Vibration of strings, three laws.\r\n\r\n3.

Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) TONE QUALITY, VIBRATING AIR COLUMNS, PLATES\r\n\r\n=345. Quality.=--The reason for the _differences in tone quality_\r\nbetween notes of the same pitch and intensity as produced, _e.g._, by a\r\nviolin and a piano, was long a matter of conjecture. Helmholtz, a German\r\nphysicist (see p. 397) first definitely proved that tone quality is due\r\nto the _various overtones_ present along with the fundamental and _their\r\nrelative intensities_. If a tuning fork is first set vibrating by\r\ndrawing a bow across it and then by striking it with a hard object, a\r\ndifference in the _quality_ of the tones produced is noticeable. It is\r\nthus evident that the manner of setting a body in vibration affects the\r\novertones produced and thus the quality. Piano strings are struck by\r\nfelt hammers at a point about one-seventh of the length of the string\r\nfrom one end. This point has been selected by experiment, it having been\r\nfound to yield the best combination of overtones as shown by the quality\r\nof the tone resulting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 337.--Chladni's plate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 338.--Chladni's figures.]\r\n\r\n=346. Chladni's Plate.=--The fact that vibrating bodies are capable of\r\nmany modes of vibration is well illustrated by what is known as\r\nChladni's plate. This consists of a circular or square sheet of brass\r\nattached to a stand at its center so as to be held horizontally. (See\r\nFig. 337.) Fine sand is sprinkled over its surface and the disc is set\r\nvibrating by drawing a violin bow across its edge. The mode of\r\nvibration of the disc is indicated by the sand accumulating along the\r\nlines of least vibration, called _nodal lines_. A variety of nodal lines\r\neach accompanied by its characteristic tone may be obtained by changing\r\nthe position of the bow and by touching the fingers at different points\r\nat the edge of the disc. They are known as Chladni's figures. (See Fig.\r\n338.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 339.--Manometric flame apparatus.]\r\n\r\n=347. Manometric Flames.=--The actual presence of overtones along with\r\nthe fundamental may be made _visible_ by the _manometric flame\r\napparatus_. This consists of a wooden box, _C_, mounted upon a stand.\r\n(See Fig. 339.) The box is divided vertically by a flexible partition or\r\ndiaphragm. Two outlets are provided on one side of the partition, one,\r\n_C_, leads to a gas pipe, the other is a glass tube, _D_. On the other\r\nside of the partition a tube, _E_, leads to a mouthpiece. A mirror, _M_,\r\nis mounted so as to be rotated upon a vertical axis in front of _F_ and\r\nnear it. Gas is now turned on and lighted at _F_. The sound of the voice\r\nproduced at the mouthpiece sends sound waves through the tube and\r\nagainst the diaphragm which vibrates back and forth as the sound waves\r\nstrike it. This action affects the flame which rises and falls. If now\r\nthe mirror is rotated, the image of the flame seen in the mirror rises\r\nand falls, showing not only the fundamental or principal vibrations but\r\nalso the overtones. If the different vowel sounds are uttered in\r\nsuccession in the mouthpiece, each is found to be accompanied by its\r\ncharacteristic wave form (Fig. 340). In some, the fundamental is\r\nstrongly prominent, while in others, the overtones produce marked\r\nmodifications. Other devices have been invented which make possible the\r\naccurate analysis of sounds into their component vibrations, while still\r\nothers unite simple tones to produce any complex tone desired.\r\n\r\n=348. The Phonograph.=--The _graphophone_ or _phonograph_ provides a\r\nmechanism for cutting upon a disc or cylinder a groove that reproduces,\r\nin the varying form or depth of the tracing, every peculiarity of the\r\nsound waves affecting it. The reproducer consists of a sensitive\r\ndiaphragm to which is attached a needle. The disc or cylinder is rotated\r\nunder the reproducing needle. The irregularities of the bottom of the\r\ntracing cause corresponding movements of the needle and the attached\r\ndiaphragm, which start waves that reproduce the sounds that previously\r\naffected the recorder. The construction of the phonograph has reached\r\nsuch perfection that very accurate reproduction of a great variety of\r\nsounds is secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 340.--Characteristic forms of manometric flames.]\r\n\r\n=349. Wind Instruments.=--In many musical instruments as the _cornet_,\r\n_pipe-organ_, _flute_, etc., and also in _whistles_, the vibrating body\r\nthat serves as a source of sound is _a column of air_, usually enclosed\r\nin a tube. Unlike vibrating strings, this vibrating source of sound\r\nchanges but little in tension or density, hence changes in the pitch of\r\nair columns is secured by changing their length. The law being similar\r\nto that with strings, _the vibration rates of air columns are inversely\r\nproportional to their lengths_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 341.--(_R_) Cross-section of an organ pipe showing\r\naction of tongue at _C_. (_a_) The fundamental tone in a closed pipe has\r\na wave length four times the length of the pipe; (_b_) and (_c_) how the\r\nfirst and second overtones are formed in a closed pipe; (_d_) the\r\nfundamental tone of an open pipe has a wave length equal to twice the\r\nlength of the pipe; (_e_) and (_f_) first and second overtones of open\r\npipe.]\r\n\r\nIf an _open_ organ pipe be sounded by blowing gently through it, a tone\r\nof definite pitch is heard. Now if one end is closed, on being sounded\r\nagain the pitch is found to be an octave lower. Therefore, _the pitch of\r\na closed pipe is an octave lower than that of an open one of the same\r\nlength_.\r\n\r\n=350. Nodes in Organ Pipes.=--Fig. 341, _R_ represents a cross-section\r\nof a wooden organ pipe. Air is blown through _A_, and strikes against a\r\nthin tongue of wood _C_. This starts the jet of air vibrating thus\r\nsetting the column of air in vibration so that the sound is kept up as\r\nlong as air is blown through _A_. To understand the mode of vibration of\r\nthe air column a study of the curve that represents wave motion (Fig.\r\n342) is helpful Let _AB_ represent such a curve, in this 2, 4 and 6\r\nrepresent nodes or points of least vibration, while 1, 3 and 5 are\r\nantinodes or places of greatest motion. A full wave length extends from\r\n1-5, or 2-6. Now in the open organ pipe (Fig. 341_d_), the end of the\r\nair column _d_ is a place of great vibration or is an antinode. At the\r\nother end also occurs another place of great vibration or an antinode;\r\nbetween these two antinodes must be a place of least vibration or a\r\nnode. The open air column therefore extends from antinode to antinode\r\n(or from 1-3) or is _one-half_ a wave length. _The closed air column_\r\n(Fig. 341_a_) extends from a place of _great_ vibration at _a_ to a\r\nplace of _no_ vibration at the closed end. The distance from an antinode\r\nto a node is that from 1-2 on the curve and is _one-fourth_ a wave\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 342.--Graphic representation of sound waves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 343.--A clarinet.]\r\n\r\nWhen a pipe is blown strongly it yields overtones. The _bugle_ is a\r\nmusical instrument in which notes of different pitch are produced by\r\ndifferences in blowing. (See Fig. 341.) (_d_), (_e_), (_f_). In playing\r\nthe _cornet_ different pitches are produced by differences in blowing,\r\nand by valves which change the length of the vibrating air column. (See\r\nFig. 334.) The _clarinet_ has a mouthpiece containing a reed similar to\r\nthat made by cutting a tongue on a straw or quill. The length of the\r\nvibrating air column in the clarinet is changed by opening holes in the\r\nsides of the tube. (See Fig. 343.)\r\n\r\n=351. How we Hear.=--Our hearing apparatus is arranged in three parts.\r\n(See Fig. 344.) _The external ear_ leads to the _tympanum_. _The middle\r\near_ contains three bones that convey the vibrations of the tympanum to\r\nthe _internal ear_. The latter is filled with a liquid which conveys the\r\nvibrations to a part having a coiled shell-like structure called the\r\n_Cochlea_. Stretched across within the cochlea are some 3000 fibers or\r\nstrings. It is believed that each is sensitive to a particular vibration\r\nrate and that each is also attached to a nerve fiber. The sound waves of\r\nthe air transmitted by the tympanum, the ear bones and the liquid of the\r\ninternal ear start sympathetic vibrations in the strings of the cochlea\r\nwhich affect the auditory nerve and we hear. The highest tones\r\nperceptible by the human ear are produced by from 24,000 to 40,000\r\nvibrations per second. The average person cannot hear sounds produced by\r\nmore than about 28,000 vibrations. The usual range of hearing is about\r\n11 octaves. The tones produced by higher vibrations than about 4100 per\r\nsecond are shrill and displeasing. In music the range is 7-1/3 octaves,\r\nthe lowest tone being produced by 27.5 vibrations, the highest by about\r\n4100 per second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 344.--The human ear.]\r\n\r\nThe tones produced by men are lower than those of women and boys. In men\r\nthe vocal cords are about 18 mm. long; in women they are 12 mm. long.\r\n\r\nThe compass of the human voice is about two octaves, although some\r\nnoted singers have a range of two and one-half octaves. In ordinary\r\nconversation the wave length of sounds produced by a man's voice is from\r\n8 to 12 ft. and that of a woman's voice is from 2 to 4 ft.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

A Comparison of Sound and Light.=--Light from the standpoint of\r\nphysics is considered much as is _sound_, as a _mode_ of _motion_; one\r\naffecting the ear, the other producing the result called _vision_. There\r\nare other differences also worth considering. (a) While sound travels as\r\nvibrations of some _material_ medium, light travels only as vibrations\r\nof the _ether_; solids, liquids, and gases act so as to hinder rather\r\nthan to assist in its movement. That is, light travels best in a vacuum\r\nor in a space devoid of ordinary matter. (b) The _speed_ of light is so\r\ngreat that at ordinary distances on the earth its motion is practically\r\ninstantaneous. Experiments have shown that its speed is about 186,000\r\nmiles to 300,000 kilometers a second.\r\n\r\n=353. Luminous and Illuminated Bodies.=--If we consider the objects\r\nwithin a room, some of them, as books and furniture, would be invisible\r\nif all light from external sources were excluded. On the other hand,\r\nsome other objects, such as a lighted lamp, a burning coal, or a red hot\r\niron, would be seen if no outside light were present. Such bodies are\r\nsaid to be luminous. Most luminous bodies are hot and become\r\nnon-luminous on cooling. There are, however, some bodies that are\r\nluminous at ordinary room temperatures, as the firefly and some\r\nphosphorescent paints. When light emitted by a luminous body strikes an\r\nobject, a portion of it is always _reflected_. It is this reflected\r\nlight that makes the illuminated object _visible_. If the object is a\r\nsheet of glass, some of the light is _transmitted_. If a substance is so\r\nclear that objects can be seen through it, the substance is\r\n_transparent_, but if objects cannot be seen through it, the substance\r\nis said to be _translucent_. Objects transmitting no light are _opaque_.\r\nSome of the light falling upon a body is neither reflected nor\r\ntransmitted, but is _absorbed_ and tends to warm the body. The light\r\nfalling upon a body is therefore either _reflected_, _transmitted_, or\r\n_absorbed_. Thus Fig. 345 represents light coming from _S_ to a piece of\r\nglass _GL_. A portion of the light represented by _R_ is reflected.\r\nAnother part _A_ is absorbed and disappears, while still another part\r\n_T_ is transmitted and passes on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 345.--The light is transmitted (_T_), reflected\r\n(_R_), or absorbed (_A_).]\r\n\r\nThere is no sharply drawn line between transparent and opaque bodies.\r\nVery thin sheets of gold transmit a greenish light, and experiments have\r\nshown that substances as transparent as clear water absorb enough light\r\nso that at considerable depths in an ocean or lake little or no light is\r\never found. All light whether from luminous bodies or reflected from\r\nnon-luminous objects shows certain properties which will now be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n=354. The Rectilinear Propagation of Light.=--If a beam of light passes\r\nthrough a hole in a window shade into a darkened room, it is seen to\r\nfollow a perfectly straight course. If a person while coughing holds a\r\nbook before the face, the sound passes around the book and is heard at\r\nany point in the room while the face is hidden by the book. In other\r\nwords, light ordinarily does not pass around corners as sound does, but\r\ntravels in _straight lines_. This fact is made use of when one aims a\r\ngun or merely looks at an object. So well established in our minds is\r\nthe idea that an _object_ is in the direction from which we see the\r\nlight coming to us from it, that we are sometimes deceived as to the\r\nreal position of an object, when the course of the light from it has\r\nbeen changed by a mirror or some other reflecting surface. Many\r\n_illusions_ are produced in this way, of which the _mirage_ of the\r\ndesert is one example. (See Art. 381.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 346.--Shadow from a small source of light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 347.--Shadow when source of light is large.]\r\n\r\n=355. Shadows.=--_A shadow is the space from which light is cut off by\r\nan opaque body._ Thus if a book (see Fig. 346) is held between a screen,\r\n_N_, and a _small_ source of light, _L_, a shadow is produced which\r\nextends from the book to the screen. Notice that the shadow is a _space_\r\nand not an _area_. If a _large_ gas flame (see Fig. 347) is used as the\r\nsource of light, the shadow of the book is no longer clear cut at the\r\nedges as before, but has a darker central part with a lighter fringe of\r\npartial shadow at the edges. The dark portion within the shadow has all\r\nthe light excluded from it and is called the _umbra_. The lighter\r\nportion of the shadow at the edges has only a part of the light from the\r\nflame cut off. This portion is called the _penumbra_. when one stands in\r\nsunlight his shadow extends from his body to the ground or object on\r\nwhich the shadow falls. At night we are in the earth's shadow, which\r\nextends out into space beyond the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348.--Character of the earth's shadow.]\r\n\r\n=356. Eclipses.=--Since the sun is a very large object the shadow cast\r\nby the earth contains both umbra and penumbra. (See Fig. 348.) When the\r\nmoon passes into the shadow of the earth, there is said to be an eclipse\r\nof the moon, while if the moon's shadow falls upon the earth, the\r\nportion of the earth cut off from the sun's light has an eclipse of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n=357. Images by Small Apertures.=--The straight line movement of light\r\nmakes possible the _pin-hole_ camera, by which satisfactory photographs\r\nhave been made. The action of this device may be illustrated by placing\r\na luminous body, a lighted candle, an incandescent lamp, or a gas flame,\r\nin front of a piece of cardboard, _S_, which has a small opening in it.\r\nLight from the object (see Fig. 349) falls upon a screen, _S_{2}_, so as\r\nto produce an _inverted image_. Other applications of this principle\r\nwill be given later.\r\n\r\n     In Fig. 349 let _PQ_ represent a gas flame, then light from point\r\n     _P_ at the _top_ of the flame will pass in a straight line through\r\n     the opening or aperture of the cardboard and strike at _P_{2}_ at\r\n     the _bottom_ of the illuminated spot upon the screen. Light from\r\n     _Q_ passing in straight lines through the aperture will strike at\r\n     _Q_{2}_ at the top of the lighted space. This spot of light will\r\n     have the same outlines as the luminous body _PQ_ and being formed\r\n     as just described will be _inverted_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 349.--Image formed by a small aperture is inverted.]\r\n\r\nThis spot of light, resembling in its outlines the flame, is called an\r\n_image_. _An image is defined as an optical counterpart of an object_.\r\nImages are formed in a variety of devices, such as _apertures_,\r\n_mirrors_, and _lenses_. The _pin-hole camera_ is simply a light-tight\r\nbox with a small aperture in one side. Light passing through this\r\naperture forms an image upon the opposite side of the interior of the\r\nbox, of whatever object is in front of the camera. Light entering a room\r\nthrough a _large_ aperture such as a window produces a multitude of\r\noverlapping images which blend to form a somewhat evenly illuminated\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Consider the circumference of the earth as 25,000 miles. How many\r\ntimes would the speed of light cover this distance in a second?\r\n\r\n2.

How much of the sun can one\r\nsee when in the moon's umbra? When in its penumbra? Have you ever been\r\nin either? When? Have you ever been in the earth's umbra? In its\r\npenumbra?\r\n\r\n4.

Why are the shadows caused by an electric arc lamp so sharply\r\ndefined?\r\n\r\n8. Why should schoolroom windows be all on one side and reach to the\r\nceiling?\r\n\r\n9. What is the relation between the size of an image and its distance\r\nfrom the aperture forming it? Can you prove this by geometry?\r\n\r\n10. What are silhouettes and how are they produced?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) PHOTOMETRY AND THE LAW OF REFLECTION\r\n\r\n=358. Photometry.=--It is desirable at times to compare the intensities\r\nof illumination produced by light from different sources. This is done\r\nto determine the _relative cost or effectiveness_ of various illuminants\r\nsuch as candles, kerosene and gas lamps, and electric lights The process\r\nof determining the relative intensity of lights or lamps is called\r\nphotometry. (_Photos_ = light.)\r\n\r\nThe unit for measuring the power of light is called a _candle power_. It\r\nis the light produced by a sperm candle burning 120 grains per hour. An\r\nordinary gas light burns 5 or more cubic feet of gas per hour and yields\r\nfrom 15 to 25 candle power. A Welsbach gas lamp, consuming 3 cu. ft. per\r\nhour, produces 50 to 100 candle power.\r\n\r\nInstead of using candles, for practical photometry, incandescent lamps\r\nstandardized by the Bureau of Standards are used for testing or\r\ncalibration purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to distinguish between the intensity of a _luminous_\r\nbody, _i.e._, as a source of light, and the _intensity_ of\r\n_illumination_ upon some surface produced by a light. It is considered\r\nthat two sources of light are of _equal intensity_ if they produce equal\r\nillumination at equal distances.\r\n\r\n=359. Law of Intensity of Light.=--A device for measuring the candle\r\npower of a light is called a _photometer_. Its use is based upon the\r\n_law of intensity of light_. _The intensity of illumination of a surface\r\nis inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the source\r\nof light._ This relation is similar to that existing between the\r\nintensity of a sound and the distance from its source. The following\r\ndevice illustrates the truth of this law in a simple manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 350.--The light spreads over four times the area at\r\ntwice the distance.]\r\n\r\n     Cut a hole 1 in. square in a large sheet of cardboard (_K_) and\r\n     place the card in an upright position 1 meter from an arc light or\r\n     other _point source_ of light (_L_). Now rule inch squares upon\r\n     another card (_M_) and place it parallel to the first card and 2\r\n     meters from it. (See Fig. 350.) The light that passed through the\r\n     hole of 1 sq. in. at a distance of 1 meter is spread over 4 sq.\r\n     in. at a distance of 2 meters. Therefore, the intensity of\r\n     illumination on each square inch of _M_ is one-fourth that upon the\r\n     surface of _K_. If _M_ is placed 3 meters from the light, 9 sq. in.\r\n     are illuminated, or the intensity is one-ninth that at 1 meter\r\n     distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 351.--The Bunsen photometer.]\r\n\r\nThese relations show that the intensity of illumination is inversely\r\nproportional to the square of the distance from the source of light. An\r\napplication of the law of intensity is made in using a simple (Bunsen)\r\nphotometer. This consists of a card containing a spot soaked with oil or\r\nmelted wax. (See Fig. 351.) The lights whose intensities are to be\r\ncompared are placed upon opposite sides of the card. The card is then\r\nadjusted so that the spot appears the same on both sides. The\r\nillumination is now equal on both sides of the card and the _candle\r\npowers of the two lights are proportional to the squares of their\r\ndistances from the card_. The simple device just described will give\r\napproximate results only. For accurate results more elaborate apparatus\r\nis required.\r\n\r\n=360. Measurement of the Intensity of Illumination.=--A standard candle\r\n(Art. 358) produces when lighted 1 candle power. The illumination caused\r\nby this upon a surface 1 ft. away and at right angles to the light rays\r\nis called a =foot-candle=. It is the unit of intensity of illumination.\r\nA 4-candle-power lamp, at a distance of 1 ft., produces 4 foot-candles.\r\nA 16-candle-power lamp at a distance of 2 ft. also produces 4\r\nfoot-candles--(16 ÷ 2²).\r\n\r\nThe intensity of illumination required for a good light for seeing\r\nvaries with the conditions. Thus, for stage and store lighting about 4\r\nfoot-candles are needed, while homes and churches may require but 1\r\nfoot-candle.\r\n\r\nToo great an intensity of illumination is as harmful as not enough.\r\nExposed lights having an intensity of more than 5 candle power per\r\nsquare inch are often a cause of eye trouble. Such lights should be\r\nprotected by frosted globes.\r\n\r\nA pleasing form of lighting for large halls and public buildings is the\r\n_indirect system_. In this, the lamps are hidden by reflectors which\r\nthrow the light upon the ceiling from which it is diffused over the\r\nroom. This form of lighting is more expensive than other systems since\r\nbut a part of the light is reflected. Its cost therefore is an important\r\nfactor when considering its use.\r\n\r\n=361. The Reflection of Light.=--The light reflected from the surfaces\r\nof bodies about us gives us information concerning our surroundings. A\r\nknowledge of the behavior of light undergoing reflection is not usually\r\ngained from ordinary observation. The law of reflection of light may be\r\nshown, however, by an experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 352.--_B´_ is as far back of the mirror as _B_ is in\r\nfront of it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTIAN HUYGENS\r\n\r\n(Popular Science Monthly)\r\n\r\nChristian Huygens (1629-1695).

Established the doctrine of\r\nconservation of energy; made many discoveries in sound; invented the\r\nophthalmoscope; established the physical basis of tone quality.]\r\n\r\n     A plane mirror, _M_, is held in a vertical position resting upon a\r\n     sheet of paper. (See Fig. 352.) Pins are set upright in the paper\r\n     at _A_ and _B_. On placing the eye along the line _AC_ and looking\r\n     toward the mirror an image of _B_ may be seen in the mirror due to\r\n     the light reflected from its surface. Pins _C_ and _D_ are now set\r\n     in the paper so that when one looks along the line _BD_ toward the\r\n     mirror one may see all four pins apparently in one line. This\r\n     indicates that the light from _A_ and _C_ passing along _CA_ toward\r\n     _O_ is reflected back along the light _CBD_. By means of a ruler,\r\n     draw lines through _BD_ and _AC_ till they intersect at _O_. Also\r\n     draw _PO_ perpendicular to the mirror at _O_.\r\n\r\nThen the angles _AOP_ and _BOP_ will be found equal. These are called\r\nthe angles of _incidence_ and _reflection_ respectively. _The law of\r\nreflection_ is therefore stated: _The angle of reflection is equal to\r\nthe angle of incidence._ These angles are in the same plane, that of the\r\npaper. This law applies in all cases of reflection of light. It is\r\nsimilar to the law of reflection of sound (Art. 326.)\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

(Find cost of each per\r\nhour, and then the cost of 1 candle power hour for each.)\r\n\r\n4. Why are not ordinary shadows perfectly dark?\r\n\r\n5.

Mirrors.=--The many purposes served by mirrors in our every-day\r\nlife has made their use familiar to everyone. Yet without study and\r\nexperiment few understand their properties and action. _Any smooth_\r\nsurface may serve as a mirror, as that of glass, water, polished wood,\r\nor metal. Most objects, unlike mirrors, have irregular surfaces; these\r\nscatter or diffuse the light that falls upon them. (See Fig. 353_a_.)\r\nThis is called _diffused or irregular reflection_. The reflection of\r\nlight from the smooth surface of a mirror is _regular_. (See Fig.\r\n353_b_.) In every case of reflected light, however, the angle of\r\nreflection equals the angle of incidence, diffusion being due to the\r\nirregularity of the surface. It is by means of the light \"diffused\"\r\nfrom the surface of illuminated bodies, such as plants, animals, food,\r\nand manufactured articles, that we \"see\" the various objects about us,\r\nand it is this light that enables us to judge of their distance, size,\r\nform, color, etc. The moon is seen by the sunlight reflected from its\r\nsurface. Moonlight is therefore sunlight diffused by reflection. The\r\n_new moon_ is that phase or condition of the moon when only a narrow\r\nstrip of the moon's illuminated surface is turned toward the earth. At\r\nthe time of the _full moon_ the whole illuminated surface is seen.\r\n\r\n=363. Images Formed by a Plane Mirror.=--The most common use of mirrors\r\nis in the formation of images. The way in which images are formed by a\r\nplane mirror may be illustrated by diagrams. Thus in Fig. 354, let _L_\r\nrepresent a luminous body and _E_ and _E´_ two positions of the\r\nobserver's eye. Take any line or ray as _LO_ along which the light from\r\n_L_ strikes the mirror _O-O´_. It will be reflected so that angle _LOP_\r\nequals angle _POE_. Similarly with any other ray, as _LO´_, the\r\nreflected ray _O´E´_ has a direction such as that angle _L´O´E´_ equals\r\nangle _P´O´E´_. Any other rays will be reflected in a similar manner,\r\neach of the reflected rays appearing to the eye to come from a point\r\n_L´_ behind the mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 354.--The virtual image of a fixed object as seen in\r\na plane mirror, has the same location from every position of the\r\nobserver's eye.]\r\n\r\n=364. Light Waves and Wave Diagrams.=--Just as a stick continually moved\r\nat the surface of a body of water sets up a series of waves spreading in\r\nall directions, so one may imagine a train of waves sent out by a\r\nluminous body _L_ (as in Fig. 355) to the mirror _MN_. These waves will\r\nbe reflected from the mirror as if the source of light were at _L´_. It\r\nis much simpler and more convenient to locate the position of the image\r\nof a point by the use of lines or \"rays\" (as in Fig. 354) than by the\r\nwave diagram (as in Fig. 355). In all _ray diagrams_, however, it should\r\nbe kept in mind that the _so-called_ ray is a symbol used to represent\r\nthe direction taken by a part of a light wave. Thus in Fig. 354, the\r\nlight from _L_ moving toward _O_ is reflected to _E_ along the line\r\n_OE_, the heavy lines representing rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 355.--Wave diagram of image formed in a plane\r\nmirror.]\r\n\r\n=365. To locate the image of an object formed by a plane mirror=\r\n_requires_ simply an application of the law of reflection. Thus in Fig.\r\n356 let _AB_ represent an object and _MN_ a plane mirror. Let _AA´_ be a\r\nray from _A_ striking the mirror _perpendicularly_. It is therefore\r\nreflected back along the same line toward _A_. Let _AO_ represent any\r\nother ray from _A_. It will be reflected along _OE_ so that angle _r_\r\nequals _i_. The intersection of _AC_ and _OE_ at _A´_ behind the mirror\r\nlocates the image of the point _A_, as seen by reflection from the\r\nmirror. The triangles _ACO_ and _A´CO_ may be proved equal by geometry.\r\nTherefore _A´C_ equals _AC_. This indicates that _the image of a point\r\nformed by a plane mirror is the same distance back of the mirror as the\r\npoint itself is in front of it_. This principle may be used in locating\r\nthe image of point _B_ at _B´_. Locating the position of the _end\r\npoints_ of an image determines the position of the whole image as\r\n_A´B´_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 356.--The image _A´B´_ is as far back of the mirror\r\n_M N_ as the object _A B_ is in front of the mirror.]\r\n\r\n=366. How the Image is Seen.=--Suppose the eye to be placed at _E_. It\r\nwill receive light from _A_ by reflection as if it came from _A´_.\r\nSimilarly light starting from _B_ reaches the eye from the direction of\r\n_B´_. There is nothing back of the mirror _in reality_ that affects our\r\nsight, the light traveling only in the space in front of the mirror. Yet\r\nthe action of the reflected light is such that it produces the same\r\neffect as if it came from behind the mirror. Images such as are seen in\r\nplane mirrors are called _virtual_ to distinguish them from _real_\r\nimages, in which light actually comes to the eye from the various parts\r\nof the visible image, as from the real image formed by a projecting\r\nlantern upon a screen, or by an aperture as in the pin-hole camera.\r\nReal images therefore are those that can be obtained upon a screen while\r\nvirtual images cannot.\r\n\r\n=367. Multiple Reflection.=--If the light from an object is reflected by\r\ntwo or more mirrors various effects may be produced, as may be\r\nillustrated by the _kaleidoscope_. This consists of three plane mirrors\r\nso arranged that a cross-section of the three forms an equilateral\r\ntriangle. The mirrors are placed in a tube across the end of which is a\r\ncompartment with a translucent cover containing pieces of colored glass.\r\nOn looking through the tube, the reflections from the several surfaces\r\nproduce beautiful hexagonal designs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 357.--Perspective view of \"Pepper's ghost.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 358.--Diagram of the \"Pepper Ghost\" illusion.]\r\n\r\n=368. Optical Illusions by a Plane Mirror.=--The _illusion_ called\r\n_Pepper's Ghost_ is typical of many illusions produced by reflection. It\r\nmay be illustrated by taking a piece of plate glass, _M-N_, a tumbler of\r\nwater, _W_, and a lighted candle, _C_, placed in a box, _B_, having one\r\nside open and arranged as shown in perspective in Fig. 357, and in\r\nsection in Fig. 358. If the effect is produced in a darkened room, the\r\nobserver at _E_ sees a virtual image of the lighted candle as if it were\r\nin the glass of water, the water being seen by transmitted light\r\n_through_ the plate glass, the latter forming a virtual image of the\r\ncandle by reflection. Some of the illusions produced by this means are:\r\n(_a_) the figure suspended in mid air; (_b_) the bust of a person\r\nwithout a trunk; (_c_) the stage ghost; (_d_) the disappearing bouquet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 359.--Action of a concave mirror on parallel rays of\r\nlight.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 360.--Real image formed by a concave mirror.]\r\n\r\n=369. Concave Mirrors.=--Another useful piece of physical apparatus is\r\nthe concave spherical mirror. It is frequently made from plano-convex\r\nlenses by silvering the convex surface of the lens, thus making a\r\nconcave reflecting surface from the inner surface of the silvered part;\r\nthey are also made by polishing the inner surfaces of metallic spherical\r\nshells. The concave mirror is represented in section in Fig. 359 by the\r\ncurve _MN_; _C_ is the _center of curvature_ or the center of the\r\nsurface of which this mirror _MN_ is a part; the line _VC_ through the\r\ncenter _V_ of the mirror is called the _principal axis_; while any other\r\nline passing through _C_ is called a _secondary axis_. The point midway\r\nbetween the vertex _V_ and center of curvature _C_ is called the\r\n_principal focus_, _F_. It is the point through which parallel incident\r\nrays pass after reflection. The angle _MCN_ which the curve of the\r\nmirror subtends at the center is called the aperture of the mirror. We\r\nlearned in Art. 361, the angle of reflection of a ray of light is always\r\nequal to the angle of incidence no matter what the nature of the\r\nreflecting surface may be. If the reflecting surface is a regular\r\nconcave surface, like the inner surface of a sphere, the rays of light\r\ncoming from a point source may after reflection come to a focus, forming\r\na real image. The two extreme points of an object should be selected for\r\nlocating its image; Fig. 360 shows the construction. The real images\r\nformed by concave mirrors are always inverted. The principal focus of a\r\nconcave mirror may be observed by holding the mirror in a beam of\r\nsunlight entering a darkened room. The sun's rays after reflection\r\nconverge to form a small, round, intense spot of light, which is a real\r\nimage of the sun, located at the principal focus of the mirror. The\r\ndistance of the principal focus from the mirror is the least distance\r\nthat a real image can be formed in front of a concave mirror.\r\n\r\n=370. Virtual Images by Concave Mirrors.=--When light comes from a small\r\npoint situated between a concave mirror and its principal focus, the\r\nreflected rays are divergent and hence no real image of the object can\r\nbe found in front of the mirror. But if the rays are extended behind the\r\nmirror they will meet in a point called the _virtual focus_. This is the\r\npoint from which they appear to come. Any image of an object situated\r\nbetween the principal focus and a concave mirror is therefore a virtual\r\nimage, erect and larger than the object. (See Fig. 361.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 361.--Virtual image formed by a concave mirror.]\r\n\r\n=371. Construction of Real Images.=--There are five positions at which\r\nan object may be situated in front of a concave mirror, namely: (1)\r\n_beyond C_; (2) at _C_; (3) _between C and F_; (4) _at F_ and (5)\r\n_between F_ and _V_. There are two ways by means of which the image\r\nformed at each of these positions may be located, namely; (1)\r\n_experimentally_, by allowing the rays of light from a luminous body to\r\nfocus on a screen and (2) _diagrammatically_. By the latter method the\r\ntwo rays of light are considered the course of each of which may easily\r\nbe determined; first, the ray which strikes the mirror parallel to its\r\nprincipal axis and which after reflection passes through the principal\r\nfocus; second, the ray which passing through the center of curvature\r\nstrikes the mirror at right angles and therefore after reflection must\r\npass directly back along its incident path. Where these two reflected\r\nrays intersect is located the real image of the object. Whenever these\r\ntwo rays of light do actually intersect, as in Fig. 360, a real image\r\n(_ab_) is formed of the object _AB_.\r\n\r\nThe points _A_ and _a_, _B_ and _b_ and others similarly situated on an\r\naxis extending through the center of curvature _C_ are called _conjugate\r\nfoci_, for they are so related that an object being at either one, its\r\nimage will be found at the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 362.--Action of a convex mirror upon parallel rays\r\nof light.]\r\n\r\n=372. The Convex Mirror.=--There are few practical uses to which convex\r\nmirrors can be put. They are sometimes used to give the chauffeur of an\r\nautomobile a view of the road behind him. It is then attached to the\r\nwind shield by a short rod. The reflected rays coming from a Convex\r\nmirror are always divergent (see Fig. 362), hence the image is always\r\nvirtual and located behind the reflecting surface. The method of\r\nconstruction for images formed by a convex mirror is similar to that for\r\nconcave mirrors. (See Fig. 363.) The center of curvature and principal\r\nfocus are behind the mirror and consequently the reflected rays have to\r\nbe produced backward until they meet. The images are always _virtual_,\r\n_erect_ and _smaller_ than the object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 363.--Construction of an image by a convex mirror.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 364.--Illustrations of Spherical Aberration.]\r\n\r\n=373. Spherical Aberration.= Sometimes in a concave mirror when the\r\naperture _MCN_ (Fig. 364) is large the images are blurred or indistinct.\r\nThis is due to the fact that the incident rays near the outer edge of\r\nthe mirror do not focus after reflection at the same point as those\r\nwhich pass into the mirror near the vertex, but cross the principal axis\r\nat points between the mirror and principal focus as is shown in Fig.\r\n364; this result is called _spherical aberration_. The larger the\r\naperture of the mirror the more the image is blurred. Concave mirrors in\r\npractical use do not have an aperture much greater than 10 degrees. This\r\nnon-focusing of the rays of light by curved reflecting surfaces may be\r\nnoticed in many places, as when light is reflected from the inside of a\r\ncup that contains milk or from the inside of a wide gold ring placed on\r\ntop of a piece of white paper. The pupil will note other instances.\r\nThis curve of light observed is called the _caustic by reflection_.\r\n\r\n=374. Parabolic Mirrors.=--The best possible surface to give to concave\r\nmirrors is parabolic. This is a curve which may be generated by moving a\r\npoint so that its distance from a fixed point and a fixed line are\r\nalways equal. If a source of light is placed at _F_ the rays after\r\nreflection are rendered parallel. See Fig. 365. This reflector is used\r\nin automobile lamps, headlights of locomotives, search-lights, etc. It\r\nis also used in large reflecting astronomical telescopes to collect as\r\nlarge an amount of light as possible from distant stars and bring it to\r\na focus. Such mirrors may be made exceedingly accurate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 365.--Parabolic mirror.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Common Examples of Refraction.=--Everyone has noticed the apparent\r\nbending of an oar, of a stick, or of a spoon when placed in water (see\r\nFig. 366), while many have observed that the bottom of a pond or stream\r\nlooks nearer to the surface than it really is. These and similar\r\nillusions are due to the _refraction_ or bending of light rays as they\r\npass from one medium to another. The principles of refraction are among\r\nthe most useful found in the study of light since application is made of\r\nthem in the construction and use of important optical instruments, such\r\nas the camera, microscope, telescope, and the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 366.--The stick appears to be bent on account of\r\nrefraction.]\r\n\r\n=376. Action of Light Undergoing Refraction.=--If a beam of sunlight be\r\nadmitted to a darkened room and reflected by a mirror so that it strikes\r\nthe surface of water in a glass jar, a part of the beam may be seen to\r\nbe reflected while another portion is transmitted through the water\r\n(Fig. 367). The reflected beam follows the law of reflection while the\r\ntransmitted beam is seen to be _refracted_, or to have its courses\r\nslightly changed in direction upon entering the water. If the mirror is\r\nturned so that the angle at which the light strikes the water is\r\nchanged, the amount of refraction or change of course of the light is\r\nvaried. When the light strikes the water perpendicularly there is no\r\nrefraction. On the other hand, the greater the angle at which the light\r\nstrikes the water the greater the bending.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 367.--Part of the ray is reflected and part passes\r\ninto the water and is refracted.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 368.--Illustrating the laws of refraction of light.]\r\n\r\n=377. Laws of Refraction.= The action of light on entering, passing\r\nthrough, and leaving a great variety of substances has been carefully\r\nstudied. A summary of the results of these observations is given in the\r\nfollowing _laws of refraction_: I. _When light enters a transparent\r\nbody, perpendicularly, it passes on without changing its direction._\r\nII. _When light enters a denser transparent body obliquely, it is bent\r\ntoward the perpendicular; when light enters a less dense body obliquely,\r\nit is bent away from the perpendicular._ (See Fig. 368.)\r\n\r\n=378. The cause of refraction= may be illustrated by considering a line\r\nof men moving across a field and occupying at equal time intervals the\r\nsuccessive positions 1, 2, 3, etc., indicated in Fig. 369. Suppose that\r\nthe upper and lower parts of the field have a smooth hard surface, while\r\nat the center is a strip of newly ploughed ground. The line will move\r\nmore slowly over the ploughed field than over the hard field. This will\r\nresult in a retardation of the end of the line first striking the soft\r\nground with a resulting change of direction of the line, _toward_ the\r\nperpendicular to the edge of the field (_on entering the place of more\r\ndifficult travel_), and _away_ from the perpendicular on moving into a\r\nplace where _increased speed results_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 369.--Diagram illustrating the cause of refraction.]\r\n\r\n=379. Index of Refraction.=--By studying the change of direction of the\r\nmarching men as shown in Fig. 369 it is evident _first_ that it is due\r\nto a difference in speed in the two media. It is not easy to measure the\r\nspeed of light in a medium. However, the amount of refraction may be\r\ndetermined easily and from this the _relative_ speed may be computed.\r\nThe _number that expresses the ratio of the speed of light in air to its\r\nspeed in another medium is called the index of refraction of that\r\nmedium_. The relative speeds of light, or the indices of refraction for\r\nsome substances, are: water, 1.33, crown glass, 1.51, flint glass,\r\n1.61, diamond, 2.47, carbon bisulphide, 1.64.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 370.--The incident ray and the emergent rays are\r\nparallel.]\r\n\r\n=380. Plates, Prisms, Lenses.=--The refraction of light is usually\r\nobserved when it is passing through a plate, a prism, or a lens. The\r\nimportant differences between the effects of each in refracting light\r\nare illustrated in Figs. 370, 371 and 372. In Fig. 370 it is seen that\r\nthe refraction of the ray on entering the glass is counteracted by the\r\nrefraction away from the perpendicular upon leaving it. So that the\r\nentering and emergent rays are _parallel_. In Fig. 371 the refraction at\r\nthe two surfaces of the prism results in a change of direction of the\r\nray, the course being bent toward the _thicker_ part of the _prism_. In\r\nFig. 372 it may be noticed that the convex lens resembles two prisms\r\nwith their bases together. Since all parts of the lens refract light\r\ntoward the thicker part, the center, the effect of the convex lens is to\r\nbring the rays of light to a focus, at _F_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 371.--Effect of a prism upon a ray of light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 372.--The convex lens brings the rays of light to a\r\nfocus.]\r\n\r\n=381. Total Reflection.=--It has been shown that when light passes from\r\na _denser to a lighter_ medium, as from glass or water to air, that the\r\nbeam is refracted _away_ from the perpendicular. This is illustrated in\r\nFig. 373. The diagram represents the change in the course of a ray of\r\nlight that passes through water to a surface with air above it. A ray\r\nstriking perpendicularly passes through without refraction. Other rays\r\nshow increasing refraction with increasing angle of incidence. For one\r\nray the angle of refraction is so large that the refracted ray is\r\nparallel to the surface. When this condition is reached, the _angle of\r\nincidence_ is called the _critical angle_. Any increase in the angle of\r\nincidence causes all of the light to be reflected as is the beam _E_.\r\nThis action is called _total reflection_, the course of the reflected\r\nray being according to the law of reflection. _A right-angle prism_ (see\r\nFig. 374) is often used where a mirror would ordinarily be employed, the\r\ntotal reflection occurring within the prism giving more satisfactory\r\nresults than a mirror. See Art. 398 for a description of the Zeiss\r\nbinocular field-glass for an example of this use of total reflection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 373.--An example of total reflection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 374.--Total reflection in a right-angle prism.]\r\n\r\n     The mirage (see Fig. 375) is an optical illusion by which distant\r\n     objects, below the horizon, are sometimes plainly seen. This\r\n     phenomenon is most frequently observed in hot, desert regions, when\r\n     the air conditions are such that the lower strata near the ground\r\n     are very much hotter than those above. These lower strata, having\r\n     expanded the most, are less dense than the cooler ones above. Hence\r\n     a ray of light traveling obliquely downward is refracted more and\r\n     more until total reflection takes place. The images seen are\r\n     inverted giving a representation of trees or other objects\r\n     reflected on the surface of still water. The mirage is also\r\n     frequently seen at sea, ships being observed, sometimes erect,\r\n     sometimes inverted, apparently sailing in the clouds near the\r\n     horizon. Over the Great Lakes, trees, boats, and towns on the\r\n     opposite shore, sixty or seventy miles away, can sometimes be\r\n     plainly seen, apparently but a few miles out. In this case the\r\n     images are erect, the total reflection being from warm, still\r\n     layers of air over colder layers near the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 375.--Diagram of a mirage.]\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n(A) Refraction: cause, illustration, two principles.\r\n\r\n(B) Index of refraction, meaning.\r\n\r\n(C) Plates, prisms, lenses, action of each.\r\n\r\n(D) Total reflection, uses.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1.

Uses of Lenses in Optical Instruments.=--The use of instruments\r\nthat employ lenses in their operation, such as spectacles, reading and\r\nopera glasses, and the camera, microscope, and telescope, is familiar to\r\nmost students of physics. The part played by the lenses, however, is not\r\ngenerally understood. Consequently the study of the formation of images\r\nby lenses is of general interest and importance.\r\n\r\n=383. Forms of Lenses.=--While a lens may be formed from any transparent\r\nsolid it is commonly made of glass. It may have two curved surfaces or\r\none curved and one plane surface. Most lenses are _spherical lenses_,\r\nsince their curved surfaces form a part of the surface of a sphere. Fig.\r\n376 represents a spherical lens with a curved surface coinciding with\r\nthat of a sphere whose center is at _C_. This center is called the\r\n_center of curvature_, while the radius of the sphere _R_, is the\r\n_radius of curvature_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 376.--Formation of a spherical lens.]\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of lenses: those thick in the middle are called\r\n_convex_, while those thick at the edges are _concave_. The mode of\r\nconstructing the six forms of spherical lenses is shown in Fig. 377.\r\nThese are named as follows: (1) double convex, (2) plano convex, (3)\r\nconcavo-convex, (4) double concave, (5) plano concave, (6)\r\nconvexo-concave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 377.--Forms of Lenses. 1. double convex; 2. plano\r\nconvex; 3. concavo convex; 4. double concave; 5. plano concave; 6.\r\nconvexo concave.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 378.--The action of a burning glass.]\r\n\r\n=384. Effect of Lenses upon Light.=--The most important characteristic\r\nof a lens is its effect upon a beam of light. Most persons have seen a\r\n\"burning glass,\" a double convex lens, used to bring to a point, or\r\nfocus, a beam of sunlight. To show the action of a burning glass send a\r\nbeam of light into a darkened room, and place in its path a double\r\nconvex lens. (See Fig. 378.) If two blackboard erasers are struck\r\ntogether near the lens, the chalk particles in the path of the light are\r\nstrongly illuminated, showing that the light after passing through the\r\nlens it brought to a focus and that it spreads out beyond this point.\r\nThis point to which the cone of light rays converges after passing\r\nthrough the convex lens is called the _principal_ focus of the lens. The\r\ndistance from the principal focus to the center of the lens is the\r\n_focal length_ or _principal focal distance_ of the lens. _The focal\r\nlength of double convex lenses of crown glass is about the same as the\r\nradius of curvature of either surface._ The action of a convex or\r\nconverging lens upon light may be better understood by studying Fig. 379\r\nin which light is passing from _S_ to _F_. The successive positions and\r\nshape of the advancing light waves are indicated by lines drawn across\r\nthe beam. The light being retarded more in the thicker part of the lens,\r\nthe light waves on leaving the lens have a concave front. Since light\r\nwaves tend to move at right angles to the front of the wave, the light\r\nis brought to a focus. After passing the focus the waves have a convex\r\nfront, forming a diverging cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 379.--Wave diagram of light passing through a convex\r\nlens.]\r\n\r\n=385. Concave Lenses.=--When sunlight passes through a _concave_ lens a\r\ndiverging cone of light is formed. (See Fig. 380.) This is caused by the\r\nedges of the wave being retarded more than the center, producing a\r\nconvex wave front. This diverging cone of light acts as if it had\r\nproceeded from a luminous point at _F_.\r\n\r\nThis point is called a _virtual_ focus and is nearly at the center of\r\nthe curvature of the nearer surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 380.--Wave diagram of light passing through a\r\nconcave lens.]\r\n\r\n=386. The Formation of Images by Lenses.=--If a beam composed of\r\n_parallel_ rays of light, as sunlight, is sent in turn through three\r\nconvex lenses of the same diameter but of different thickness, it is\r\nfound that the _thicker the lens the greater is its converging power, or\r\nthe shorter is its focal_ length. (See Fig. 381.) Now if a luminous\r\nbody, such as a lighted candle, be placed near the convex lens but\r\n_beyond its focal length_, the light will be brought to a focus upon the\r\nother side of the lens and an image of the candle may be clearly seen\r\nupon the screen placed at this point. (See Fig. 382.) _The two points so\r\nsituated on opposite sides of a lens that an object at one will form an\r\nimage at the other are called conjugate foci._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 381.--The thicker the lens, the shorter is its focal\r\nlength.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 382.--_C_ and _S_ are at conjugate foci.]\r\n\r\nIt will be helpful to compare the images formed of a candle by an\r\n_aperture_ and by a _convex_ lens. Rays of light from each point of the\r\nluminous body pass through the aperture in straight lines and produce\r\nupon the screen a lighted space of the same shape as the candle. This\r\nimage is rather _hazy_ in outline. Each cone of rays from luminous\r\npoints of the flame is brought by the lens to a focus on the screen,\r\nproducing a _sharp image_. It is the converging power of convex lenses\r\nthat enables them to produce clear images.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 383.--Construction of a real image by a convex\r\nlens.]\r\n\r\n=387. The Construction of Diagrams to Represent the Formation of Images\r\nby Lenses.=--Just as the earth has an axis at right angles to its\r\nequator to which are referred positions and distances, so a lens has a\r\n_principal axis_ at right angles to its greatest diameter and along this\r\naxis are certain definite positions as shown in Fig. 383. Let _MN_ be\r\nthe _principal axis_ of a convex lens, _P_ and _P´_ are _principal foci_\r\non either side of the lens, _S_ and _S´_ are _secondary foci_. These are\r\nat points on the principal axis that are twice as far from _O_, the\r\ncenter of the lens, as are the principal foci. In the formation of\r\nimages by a convex lens, several distinct cases may be noticed:\r\n\r\n(A) If a luminous body is at a _great distance_ at the left, its light\r\nis brought to a _focus_ at _P_, or its _image is formed at P_. (B) As\r\nthe _object approaches_ the lens the _image gradually recedes_ until the\r\nobject and image are at _S_ and _S´_, _equally distant from O and of\r\nequal size_ (as in Fig. 383). The object and image are now said to be at\r\nthe _secondary foci_ of the lens. (C) As the _object moves from S to P_\r\nthe image recedes, rapidly increasing in size until (D) when the object\r\nis at _P_ the rays become parallel and no image is formed. (E) When the\r\nobject is between _P_ and the lens, the rays _appear to proceed from\r\npoints back of the object_, thus forming an _erect, larger, virtual\r\nimage_ of the object. (See Fig. 384.) This last arrangement illustrates\r\nthe _simple microscope_.\r\n\r\nWith a concave lens but one case is possible, that corresponding to the\r\none last mentioned with convex lenses; since the rays from a body are\r\ndivergent after passing through a concave lens they appear to proceed\r\nfrom points _nearer_ the lens than the object and hence a _virtual,\r\nerect, smaller image_ of the object is formed. This virtual image may be\r\nseen by looking _through_ the lens toward the object. (See Fig. 385.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 384.--Construction of a virtual image by a convex\r\nlens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 385.--Construction of a virtual image by a concave\r\nlens.]\r\n\r\n=388. The Lens Equation.=--The location of either the object or of the\r\nimage upon the principal axis of the lens may be calculated if the\r\nposition of one of these and the focal length are known. This is\r\naccomplished by the use of a formula 1/_F_ = 1/_D_{0}_ + 1/_D_{1}_ in\r\nwhich _F_ represents the focal length and _D_{0}_ and _D_{1}_ the\r\ndistance from the lens of the object and the image respectively. Thus if\r\nan object is placed 30 cm. from a lens of 10 cm. focal length, where\r\nwill the image be formed? Thus: 1/10 = 1/30 + 1/_D_ and 3_D_{1}_ =\r\n_D_{1}_ + 30, or 2_D_{1}_ = 30 _D_{1}_ = 15. This result indicates that\r\na real image will be 15 cm. from the lens. A minus value would indicate\r\na virtual image.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n(A) Lenses: convex, concave, six forms, center and radius of curvature.\r\n\r\n(B) Principal focus, focal length, virtual focus, conjugate foci.\r\n\r\n(C) Principal axis, images formed when object is in various locations.\r\n\r\n(D) Computation of location of images.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1.

While\r\nthe structure of the eye is complicated, the principle of it is simple,\r\ninvolving the formation of an image by a double convex lens. (See Fig.\r\n386, in which is shown a front to back, vertical cross-section of the\r\neye.) The eye appears to be made of portions of two spheres, one of\r\nwhich, smaller than the other, is placed in front. This projecting part\r\nis transparent, but refracts the light which strikes it obliquely, so as\r\nto turn it into the eye. This enables us to see objects at the side when\r\nlooking straight ahead. Test this by looking directly in front of you\r\nand see how far back on each side of the head you can notice a movement\r\nof the forefinger of each hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 386.--Cross-section of the eye.]\r\n\r\n=390. Action of the Eye in Vision.=--When we look at an object, a small,\r\nreal, inverted image is formed upon the _retina_ at the back of the\r\ninterior of the eye. The retina is an expansion of the optic nerve and\r\ncovers the inner surface at the back of the eyeball. Seeing is due to\r\nthe action of light in forming images upon the retina. Our eyes are so\r\nconstructed that when they are relaxed the lens is adjusted to form\r\nclear images of _distant_ objects upon the retina. If we look from\r\ndistant to near objects without changing the shape of the eye lens, a\r\nsharp image of the latter cannot be formed and we get a blurred\r\nimpression. It is difficult, however, to look at objects without\r\nautomatically adjusting the eye lens so that it will make a sharp image.\r\nTest this by looking out of a window at a distant object, then without\r\nmoving the head or eyes look at the glass of the window; you will notice\r\na slight change of some sort _in_ the eye itself as the vision is\r\nadjusted. This adjustment is made by muscles that pull or compress the\r\neye lens so as to make it thicker for near objects and thinner for\r\ndistant ones. The eye ordinarily does not see objects nearer than 10 in.\r\nclearly. This means that the greatest possible thickening of lens will\r\nnot form clear images upon the retina if the object is nearer than 10\r\nin. (25 cm.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 387.--The visual angle, _AOB_ is greater at _AB_\r\nthan at _A´B´_.]\r\n\r\n=391. The Visual Angle.=--To examine objects carefully we usually bring\r\nthem as close to the eye as possible, for the nearer to the eye the\r\nobject is brought, the larger is the visual angle formed by it (see Fig.\r\n387), and the larger is its image upon the retina. _The visual angle of\r\nan object is the angle at the eye lens between the rays that have come\r\nfrom the ends of the object._ Consequently the more distant the object,\r\nthe smaller is its visual angle. Now if we wish to examine small objects\r\nwith great care, we frequently find that it is necessary to bring them\r\nclose to the eye so that they have a visual angle of adequate size. If\r\nthey must be brought closer than 10 in. a double convex lens is placed\r\nin front of the eye. This assists the eye lens in converging the light\r\nso that a clear image may be formed when the object is close, say an\r\ninch or so from the eye. This is the principle of the magnifying glass\r\nused by watch-makers and of the _simple microscope_. The action of the\r\nlatter is illustrated by Fig. 388. The convex lens forms a virtual,\r\nenlarged image \"_A´-B´_\" of the object \"_A-B_\" which it observed instead\r\nof the object itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 388.--Action of the simple microscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 389.--\"Near sightedness\", or myopia. Parallel rays\r\ncome to a focus at _F_; emerging rays focus at _A_, the far point.]\r\n\r\n=392. Defects of Vision.=--There are several defects of vision that may\r\nbe corrected by spectacles or eye-glasses. One of these is\r\n\"near-sightedness.\" It is due either to an eyeball that is elongated, or\r\nto an eye lens that is too convex, or to both conditions. This condition\r\nbrings light from distant objects to a focus too soon (as shown in Fig.\r\n389). Only light from near objects will focus upon the retina in such\r\ncases. With _normal_ vision light from _distant_ or _near_ objects may\r\nbe focused without unusual effort upon the retina, see Fig. 390. The\r\nremedy for near-sightedness is to use concave lenses which will assist\r\nin properly refracting the light so the focus will be formed on the\r\nretina (Fig. 391). \"Far-sightedness\" is the reverse of near-sightedness;\r\nthe eyeball is either too short, or the lens too flat, or both\r\nconditions obtain, so that the light entering the eye is brought to a\r\nfocus behind the eyeball (Fig. 392). The remedy is convex lenses which\r\nwill assist in properly converging the light, see Fig. 393. A third\r\ndefect is called _astigmatism_. This is caused by some irregularity or\r\nlack of symmetry in the eye. It is corrected by a _cylindrical_ lens\r\nthat compensates for this defect of the eye. A diagram similar to Fig.\r\n394 is used as a test for astigmatism. If the lines appear with unequal\r\ndistinctness, some irregularity of refraction (astigmatism) is\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 390.--The normal eye. The parallel rays _A B_ focus\r\nwithout accommodative effort at _C_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 391.--Correction of near-sightedness by concave\r\nlens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 392.--Far-sightedness or hyperopia. Parallel rays\r\nfocused behind the retina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 393.--Correction of far-sightedness by a convex\r\nlens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 394.--Test card for astigmatism.]\r\n\r\n=393. The Photographic Camera.=--This is a light-tight box, provided\r\nwith a convex lens in front, covering an aperture and a ground glass\r\nscreen at the back. The distance between the lens and the screen is\r\nadjusted until a sharp image is obtained upon the latter, which is then\r\nreplaced by a sensitive plate or film. The sensitized surface of the\r\nplate or film contains a salt of silver which is changed by the action\r\nof light. After the plate has been \"exposed\" to the action of light, it\r\nis \"developed\" by the use of chemicals producing a _negative_ image.\r\nFrom \"negative,\" by the use of sensitized paper, \"positive\" prints may\r\nbe secured which resemble the object photographed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 395.--Diagram of the projecting lantern.]\r\n\r\n=394. The projecting lantern= (see Fig. 395) employs a strong source of\r\nlight, as an electric arc lamp _L_, to strongly illuminate a transparent\r\npicture, or _lantern slide_, _S_, a real image (_I_) of which is formed\r\nupon a large screen. Two large plano-convex lenses (_C_), called\r\ncondensing lenses, are placed near the lamp to concentrate the light\r\nupon the \"slide\" _S_. The convex lens forming the image is called the\r\n\"objective\" (_O_).\r\n\r\n=395. The compound microscope= consists of two lenses. One called the\r\n_objective_ is placed near the object to be viewed. This lens has a\r\nshort focal length usually less than a centimeter. It forms a _real\r\nimage_ of the object. _A´_-_B´_. The other lens, the _eyepiece_ forms a\r\nvirtual image of this real image. _A´´_-_B´´_. (See Fig. 396.)\r\n\r\n=396. The telescope= consists of two lenses, the eyepiece and the\r\nobjective. As in the compound microscope, the objective of the telescope\r\nforms a real image of the distant object, the eyepiece forming an\r\nenlarged virtual image of the real image. It is the virtual image that\r\nis viewed by the observer. (See Fig. 397.) In order to collect\r\nsufficient light from distant stars the objective is made large,\r\nsometimes 50 in. in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 396.--Formation of an image by a microscope. _A_-_B_\r\nis the object. _B´_-_A´_ the real image formed by the \"objective.\"\r\n_B´´_-_A´´_ is the virtual image formed by the eyepiece. The eye sees\r\nthe virtual image.]\r\n\r\nThe length of the telescope tube depends upon the focal length of the\r\nobjective, since the distance between the two lenses must equal the\r\n_sum_ of their focal lengths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 397.--Formation of an image by a telescope. _b_-_a_\r\nis the real image; _d_-_c_ is the virtual image seen by the observer.]\r\n\r\n=397. The opera glass= consists of a convex lens as objective and a\r\n_concave_ lens as an eyepiece. The former tends to form a real image but\r\nthe latter diverges the rays before a real image can be formed, the\r\naction of the two lenses producing an enlarged virtual image (as in Fig.\r\n398) which is viewed by the one using the glass. The compact size of\r\nthe opera glass is due to the fact that the distance between the two\r\nlenses is the _difference_ of the focal lengths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 398.--Formation of an image by an opera-glass.\r\n_a_-_b_ is the virtual image.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 399.--Diagram of the Zeiss binocular or prism field\r\nglass.]\r\n\r\n=398. The Prism Field Glass or Binocular.=--This instrument. has come\r\ninto use in recent years. It possesses the wide field of view of the spy\r\nglass but is as compact as the opera glass. This compact form is secured\r\nby causing the light to pass back and forth between two right-angle\r\nprisms (as shown in Fig. 399). This device permits the use of an\r\nobjective lens with a focal length three times that of the tube,\r\nsecuring much greater magnifying power than the short instrument would\r\notherwise possess. A further advantage is secured by the total\r\nreflection from the two prisms, one of which is placed so as to reverse\r\nthe image right for left and the other inverts it, so that when viewed\r\nin the eyepiece it is in its proper position.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

Y.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander Graham Bell, Washington, D. C. Inventor of the telephone.]\r\n\r\n=399. Color.=--Much of the pleasure experienced in gazing at beautiful\r\nobjects is due to the _color_ shown by them. The blue sky, the green\r\ngrass, and the varied tints of flowers, and of the rainbow all excite\r\nour admiration The study of color begins naturally with the production\r\nof the _spectrum_, the many-colored image upon a screen produced by\r\npassing a beam of light through a prism. The spectrum is best shown when\r\nthe light enters by a narrow slit (Fig. 400). The spectrum was first\r\nproduced by Sir Isaac Newton in 1675 by the means just described. The\r\nnames usually given to the more prominent colors of the spectrum are\r\nviolet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. The initials of\r\nthese names, combined, spell _vibgyor_, a word without meaning except to\r\nassist in remembering the order of the colors in a spectrum. If the\r\nlight that has passed through a prism is sent through a second prism\r\nplaced in reverse position (see Fig. 401), the light passing through\r\nboth prisms is found to be white. This experiment _indicates that white\r\nlight is composed of light of all colors_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 400.--Formation of the spectrum by a prism.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 401.--The colors of the spectrum recombine to form\r\nwhite light.]\r\n\r\n=400. Dispersion.=--The separation of the colors by a prism is called\r\ndispersion. In experimenting to find a reason for dispersion, it has\r\nbeen learned that lights of different colors are of different wave\r\nlengths. Color in light is therefore analogous to pitch in sound. We\r\nhear through many octaves, but we see through about one octave. That is,\r\nthe shortest visible waves of violet light are about 0.000038 cm. in\r\nlength while the longest visible red rays are 0.000076 cm., or the\r\nlongest visible light waves are about twice the length of the shortest\r\nvisible ones. It appears from the evidence of experiments upon\r\ndispersion that _light waves of different lengths are refracted\r\ndifferently_. This causes the images formed by refraction through simple\r\nglass lenses to be fringed with color and to lose some of their\r\nsharpness and definiteness of outline, since the violet light is brought\r\nto a focus sooner than the red. (See Fig. 402.) This seriously affects\r\nthe value of such lenses for optical purposes. Fortunately it is found\r\nthat _different kinds of glass have a different rate of dispersion for\r\nthe same amount of refraction_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 402.--Violet light comes to a focus sooner than\r\nred.]\r\n\r\n=401. The Achromatic Lens.=--The existence of these different kinds of\r\nglass makes possible a combination of lenses in which dispersion is\r\nentirely overcome with the loss of only about one-half of the\r\nrefraction. Such a combination is shown in Fig. 403. It is called an\r\n_achromatic lens_, since images formed by it are not colored but white\r\n(_a_ = without, _chroma_ = color). _The achromatic lens consists of a\r\ndouble convex lens of crown glass combined with a plano-concave lens of\r\nflint glass._ Achromatic lenses are used in all high-grade optical\r\ninstruments such as telescopes and microscopes. The colored images that\r\nare sometimes seen in cheap opera glasses show the result of not using\r\nachromatic lenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 403.--An achromatic lens. _C_ is of crown glass;\r\n_F_, of flint glass.]\r\n\r\n=402. The Color of Bodies.=--Project the spectrum of sunlight upon a\r\nwhite surface in a darkened room.\r\n\r\n     Now place in different parts of the spectrum objects of various\r\n     colors. Red objects will show brilliant red when at the red end of\r\n     the spectrum but look black at the blue end, while blue objects\r\n     appear blue only at the blue end.\r\n\r\nThese facts indicate that the color of an object depends upon two\r\nthings: (a) _the light that falls upon it and_ (b) _the light which it\r\nsends to the eye_. A _black_ surface absorbs all color while a _white_\r\none reflects all wave lengths to the eye in the same proportion that\r\nthey come to it. A white object will appear red in red light, and blue\r\nin blue light since it reflects both of these. A _colored_ object\r\nreflects light of its own color but absorbs all others. The color then\r\nof a body is due to the light which it does not absorb, but which comes\r\nfrom it to the eye.\r\n\r\n_403. The color of transparent bodies_, such as colored glass, is due to\r\nthe presence of a _dye_ or _pigment_ contained in the body. This pigment\r\nabsorbs a part of the light, the part transmitted giving the color. This\r\nmay be shown by holding a sheet of colored glass in a beam of light\r\neither before or after it has passed through a prism. Some colors, as\r\nred, may be found to be nearly _pure_, only the red passing through,\r\nwhile green glass often transmits in addition to the green some yellow\r\nand some red light.\r\n\r\n=404. Complementary Colors.=--If two prisms are placed in reversed\r\nposition near each other (see Fig. 401), a beam of light dispersed by\r\none is recombined into white light by the other. If now a card is held\r\nbetween the two prisms so as to cut off some of the colored light, say\r\nthe red, the remaining light will be found to form a _greenish blue_. If\r\nthe card is removed, the light becomes _white_ again. That is, red and\r\n_peacock blue_ light together form white. Any two colors that together\r\nform white light are called _complementary_. Other complementary colors\r\nare light yellow and blue, green and crimson, orange and greenish blue,\r\nviolet and greenish yellow. We must not confuse the combining of colors\r\n(light) and the combining of _pigments_, the latter consisting of bodies\r\nthat absorb light. Yellow pigment absorbs all but yellow and some green,\r\nwhile blue pigment absorbs all but blue and some green. Mixing these two\r\npigments causes the absorption of all colors but _green_. Blue and\r\nyellow _paint_ mixed produce _green_, while blue and yellow _light_ give\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n=405. The solar spectrum=, as the spectrum of sunlight is called, may be\r\nobserved in the _rainbow_. The latter is produced through the dispersion\r\nof light by spherical raindrops. Its formation may be imitated by\r\nsending a small circular beam of light through a screen against a round\r\nglass flask filled with water. (See Fig. 404.) The light passes through\r\nthe water and is dispersed when it enters and when it leaves, producing\r\na color upon the screen at _R_-_V_. The course of the light within the\r\ndrop is indicated in Fig. 405. The violet ray comes to the eye more\r\nnearly horizontal and is therefore below red, as we look at the rainbow.\r\n\r\n=406. Fraunhofer Lines.=--Some of the most important features of the\r\nsolar spectrum are not seen in the rainbow or in the band of light\r\nusually observed upon a screen. By the use of a narrow slit and a\r\nconvex lens to carefully focus the slit upon a white screen it is seen\r\nthat the solar spectrum is crossed by many _dark_ lines. These are\r\ncalled Fraunhofer lines, to honor the German scientist who in 1814 first\r\naccurately determined _their_ position. Two experiments _with a\r\nspectroscope_ will help to make clear the meaning of the Fraunhofer\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 404.--A rainbow formed by a beam of light striking a\r\nflask of water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 405.--The course of a beam of light within a drop of\r\nwater.]\r\n\r\n=407. The Spectroscope and Its Uses.=--The spectroscope (Fig. 406) is an\r\ninstrument for observing spectra. It consists of a prism, a slit, and a\r\nconvex lens _T_ for focusing an image of the slit accurately upon a\r\nscreen (Fig. 407) where the spectrum is observed through the eyepiece\r\n_E_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 406.--The spectroscope.]\r\n\r\n(A) A Bunsen flame is placed in front of the slit and a heated platinum\r\nwire which has been dipped in common salt or some sodium compound placed\r\nin the Bunsen flame; the latter becomes yellow and a vivid yellow line\r\nis observed on the screen in the spectroscope. Other substances, as\r\nbarium and strontium salts, when heated to incandescence in the Bunsen\r\nflame, give characteristic bright lines. In fact each _element_ has been\r\nfound to have its own characteristic set of colored lines. This fact is\r\nmade use of in _spectrum analysis_, by which the presence of certain\r\nelements in a substance can be definitely proved upon the appearance of\r\nits particular lines in the spectrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 407.--Diagram of a spectroscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 408.--The bright line spectrum of iron and its\r\ncoincidences with some of the dark lines of the solar spectrum.]\r\n\r\n(B) If light from, for example, an arc light is sent over a gas flame\r\ncontaining _sodium_ vapor, a _dark line_ appears in the spectrum--in\r\nthe exact position in which the yellow sodium line appeared. It seems\r\nthat the sodium vapor removes from white light the same wave lengths\r\nthat it itself produces. This absorption is supposed to be due to\r\nsympathetic vibration; just as a tuning fork is set in vibration by the\r\nwaves of another fork in unison with it, at the same time absorbing the\r\nwave energy, so in the gas flame the sodium particles absorb the wave\r\nmotion of the same vibration rate as that emitted by them. The fact that\r\nthe spectrum of sunlight contains a great many dark lines is believed to\r\nindicate that the sun is surrounded by clouds formed by the vaporization\r\nof the various substances in the sun itself. By comparing the dark lines\r\nof the solar spectrum with the _bright-line spectra_ of various\r\nsubstances found in the earth, such an exact correspondence of the lines\r\nis found that the presence of the vapor of these substances about the\r\nsun is considered proved. (See Fig. 408 which shows the exact\r\ncorrespondence between the bright-line spectrum of iron vapor and the\r\ndark lines appearing in a portion of the sun's spectrum.) The spectra of\r\nthe stars also contain certain dark lines. Thus the presence of the\r\ncorresponding substances in distant stars is considered as determined.\r\n\r\n=408. Theory of Color Vision.=--By combining light of the _three colors_\r\n_red_, _green_ and _blue-violet_ in proper proportions, it has been\r\nfound possible to produce any color effect, even white. This leads to\r\nthe conclusion that in the retina of the eye are three different kinds\r\nor sets of sensitive nerve endings, sensitive respectively to red, to\r\ngreen, and to blue light. This idea is given corroboration by some facts\r\nof color blindness. Thus some persons have no sensation of _red_, this\r\ncolor not being distinguished from green. Others are color blind to\r\ngreen or blue. It is supposed that in color blind persons one of the\r\nsets of nerve endings sensitive to one of these three colors is lacking.\r\n\r\n=409. Three-color Printing.=--Since all colors may be produced by mixing\r\nthe three colors, light red, green, and blue-violet, these are called\r\n_the three primary colors_. The so-called primary pigments or paints are\r\nsimply the complements of the three primary colors. They are, in order,\r\npeacock blue, crimson, and light yellow. The three pigments when mixed\r\nyield black, since combined they absorb all kinds of visible light. The\r\nprocess of three-color printing, now so generally employed in printing\r\ncolored pictures for books, calendars, etc., consists in combining upon\r\nwhite paper three colored impressions, using successively the three\r\nprimary pigments (yellow, crimson and blue) from plates prepared as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThree photographs of a given colored object are taken, each through a\r\ndifferent sheet of gelatine called a filter, stained the color of one of\r\nthe primary colors. From these photographs half-tone blocks are made in\r\nthe usual way. The colored picture is made by carefully superposing\r\nimpressions from these blocks, using in each case an ink whose color is\r\nthe complement of the \"filter\" through which the original picture was\r\ntaken. An illustration of the process is given upon the plate in the\r\nfrontispiece of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

The Corpuscular Theory.=--The theory of the nature of light that\r\nwas most generally accepted until about the year 1800, held that light\r\nconsists of streams of minute particles, called corpuscles, moving at\r\nenormous velocities. This _corpuscular theory_ was in accord with the\r\nfacts of reflection and the _rectilinear_ motion of light, but was\r\nabandoned after the discovery of the _interference of light_, as it\r\ncould not account for the latter phenomenon.\r\n\r\n=411. The Wave Theory of Light.=--The theory that _light is_ a _form of\r\nwave motion_ was first advanced by Huygens, a Dutch physicist, in the\r\nseventeenth century. This theory was opposed at the start since (A) _no\r\nmedium_ was known to exist which would convey wave motion through space,\r\nas from the sun to the earth, and (B) the _rectilinear motion_ of light\r\nwas _unlike_ that of any _other_ form of known wave motions, such as\r\nthat of water or of sound waves which are able to bend around corners.\r\nIn answer to the first objection, Huygens assumed the presence of a\r\nmedium which he named _ether_, while the second objection has been\r\ncompletely overcome during the past century by the discovery that _light\r\nmay deviate from a straight line_. It is now known that the _excessive\r\nshortness_ of light waves is the reason for its straight-line motion.\r\nFurther, long ether waves, as those of wireless telegraphy, are found to\r\nbend around obstacles in a manner similar to those of water or sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 409.--Two plates pressed together by a screw clamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 410.--Illustrating the interference of light by a\r\nthin film of air.]\r\n\r\n=412. The interference of light= is one of the phenomena for which the\r\nwave theory offers the only satisfactory explanation. Interference of\r\nlight may be shown by taking two pieces of plate glass and forcibly\r\npressing them together by a screw clamp, as shown in Fig. 409. After a\r\ncertain pressure has been reached, colored rings will appear about the\r\ncompressed spot when viewed by light _reflected_ from the upper surface\r\nof the glass. If light of one color, such as that transmitted by red\r\nglass, falls upon the apparatus, the rings are seen to be alternately\r\nred and dark bands. The explanation of this phenomenon according to the\r\nwave theory is as follows: The two sheets of glass, although tightly\r\npressed together, are separated in most places by a thin wedge of air\r\n(see Fig. 410), which represents in an exaggerated form the bending of\r\nthe plates when pressed by the clamp. Several waves are represented as\r\ncoming from the right and entering the glass. Now the wave moving from\r\n_R_ to the plates has some of its light reflected from each glass\r\nsurface. Consider the two portions of the wave reflected at each of the\r\nsurfaces between the plates, _i.e._, from the two surfaces of the wedge\r\nof air. If the portion of the wave reflected from the second surface of\r\nthe air wedge combines with that reflected from the first surface, in\r\nthe _same phase_ as at _C_, the two reflected waves strengthen each\r\nother. While if the two reflected portions of the wave meet in opposite\r\nphases as at _A_ and _B_, a decrease or a complete extinction of the\r\nlight results. This is called _interference_. If light of one wave\r\nlength is used, as red light, the regions of reinforcement and\r\ninterference are shown by red and dark rings, while if white light is\r\nused, the ring where red light interferes, yields its complementary\r\ncolor, greenish blue. Where interference of greenish blue occurs, red is\r\nfound, etc. Many phenomena are due to interference, such as (A) the\r\ncolor of thin films of oil on water, where the portions of light\r\nreflected from the two surfaces of the oil film interfere resulting in\r\nthe production of color; (B) the color of soap bubbles. When first\r\nformed, soap-bubble films are not thin enough to show interference well,\r\nbut as the bubbles increase in size or become thinner on standing, the\r\nconditions for interference are reached and, as the film becomes\r\nthinner, a regular succession of colors is noticed.\r\n\r\n=413. Differences Between Light and Sound.=--Among the important\r\ndifferences between light and sound that have been considered are the\r\nfollowing: the former are (a) _waves_ in the ether, (b) _of very short\r\nwave length_, and (c) their _motion is in straight lines_. Another\r\ndifference (d) is in _the mode of vibration_.\r\n\r\nSound waves are _longitudinal, while light waves are transverse_. Light\r\nwaves consist of vibrations of the ether at right angles to the line of\r\nmotion. To illustrate the reasoning that has led to this conclusion,\r\nsuppose a rope to be passed through two vertical gratings. (See Fig.\r\n411, 1.) If the rope be set in _transverse_ vibration by a hand, the\r\nwaves produced will readily pass through to the gratings _P_ and _Q_ and\r\ncontinue in the part extending beyond _Q_. If, however, _Q_ is at right\r\nangles to _P_, no motion will be found beyond _Q_. Now if a stretched\r\ncoiled spring with longitudinal vibrations should take the place of the\r\nrope, it is evident that the crossed position of the two gratings would\r\noffer no obstacles to the movement of the vibration. In other words,\r\ncrossed gratings offer no obstruction to longitudinal vibrations, while\r\nthey may completely stop transverse vibrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 411.--Transverse waves will pass through both\r\ngratings in (1) where the openings in the two gratings are at right\r\nangles. The waves passing _P_ are stopped by _Q_ (2).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 412.--Effect of tourmaline crystals on light.]\r\n\r\n=414. Polarization of Light.=--It is found that two crystals of\r\ntourmaline behave toward light just as the two gratings behave with\r\nrespect to the transverse waves of the rope. Thus, if a small opening in\r\na screen is covered with a _tourmaline_ crystal, light comes through but\r\nslightly diminished in intensity. If a second crystal is placed over the\r\nfirst one so that the two axes are in the same direction as in Fig.\r\n412_P_, light is as freely transmitted through the second crystal as\r\nthrough the first, but if the crystals are crossed (Fig. 412_S_) no\r\nlight passes the second crystal. This experiment shows that the light\r\nwhich has passed through one tourmaline crystal will pass through\r\nanother only when the latter is held in a certain position, hence it is\r\nbelieved that a tourmaline crystal is capable of transmitting light\r\nthat is vibrating in one particular plane. The direct conclusion from\r\nthis is that _light waves_ are _transverse rather than longitudinal_.\r\nThe experiment just described illustrates what is called _polarization\r\nof light_. The beam that after passing through _a_ (Fig. 412) is unable\r\nto pass through _b_, if the two axes are crossed, is called a _polarized\r\nbeam_. The conclusion that light waves are transverse is therefore based\r\nupon the phenomenon of the polarization of light. This was first\r\ndiscovered by Huygens in 1690.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1. Interference of light: evidence, reasoning involved, illustration.\r\n\r\n2.

Oscillatory Nature of the Spark from a Leyden Jar.=--In studying\r\nsound (Art. 339), the sympathetic vibration of two tuning forks having\r\nthe same rate of vibration was given as an illustration of resonance.\r\nThe conditions for obtaining _electrical resonance_ by the use of two\r\nLeyden jars are given in the following experiment.\r\n\r\n     Join the two coats of a Leyden jar (Fig. 413) to a loop of wire\r\n     _L_, the sliding crosspiece _M_ being arranged so that the length\r\n     of the loop may be changed as desired. Also place a strip of\r\n     tinfoil in contact with the inner coating and bring it over to\r\n     within about a millimeter of the outer coating as indicated at _G_.\r\n     Now join the outer coating of another exactly similar jar _A_ to a\r\n     wire loop of fixed length, the end of the loop being separated from\r\n     the knob connected to the inner coating, a short distance at _P_.\r\n     Place the jars near each other with the wire loops parallel and\r\n     connect coatings of _A_ to the terminals of a static machine or an\r\n     induction coil. At each discharge between the knobs at _P_, a spark\r\n     will appear in the other jar at _G_, if the crosspiece _M_ is so\r\n     adjusted that the areas of the two loops are exactly equal. When\r\n     the wire _M_ is moved so as to make the areas of the two loops\r\n     quite unequal, the spark at _G_ disappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 413.]\r\n\r\nThe experiment just described shows that two electrical circuits can be\r\n_tuned_ by adjusting their lengths, just as two tuning forks may be\r\nmade sympathetic by adjusting their lengths. This fact indicates that\r\nthe discharge of the Leyden jar is _oscillatory_, since resonance can\r\nplainly not be secured except between bodies having natural periods of\r\nvibration. This same fact is also shown by examining the discharge of a\r\nLeyden jar as it appears when viewed in a rapidly revolving mirror. (See\r\nFig. 414.) The appearance in the mirror shows that the discharge is made\r\nup of a number of sparks, often a dozen or more, vibrating back and\r\nforth until they finally come to rest. The time of one vibration varies\r\nfrom one millionth to one hundred millionth of a second, depending on\r\nthe space between the discharging balls and the size of the jars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 414.--Photograph of the oscillatory discharge of a\r\nLeyden jar.]\r\n\r\nThe discharge of a Leyden jar or of another condenser sets up ether\r\nwaves that have the speed of light. Heinrich Hertz in Germany first\r\nproved this in 1888. These waves are now known as Hertzian waves. The\r\nlength of these varies from 3 cm. to several miles, depending upon the\r\nsize and conditions of the discharging circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 415.--A coherer.]\r\n\r\n=416. The Coherer.=--The coherer is a device for detecting electric\r\nwaves. It consists of a glass tube with metal filings loosely packed\r\nbetween two metal plugs that fit the tube closely. (See Fig. 415.) These\r\nfilings offer a _high_ resistance to the passage of an electric current,\r\nbut when electric waves pass through the filings these _cohere_ and\r\nallow a weak current to pass through. This current may be strong enough\r\nto operate a relay connected with a sounder or bell that gives audible\r\nsignals. If the tube be tapped the filings will be disturbed and the\r\nresistance again made so high that no current can pass through.\r\n\r\n=417. Wireless Telegraphy.=--In 1894 Marconi, then a young man of\r\ntwenty, while making some experiments with electrical discharges\r\ndiscovered that the coherer would detect electrical waves at a\r\nconsiderable distance from their source and that by the use of a\r\ntelegraph key the \"dots and dashes\" of the telegraph code could be\r\nreproduced by a sounder attached to a relay. At present the coherer is\r\nused principally in laboratory apparatus, as much more sensitive\r\ndetectors are now available for commercial work. The essential parts of\r\na modern wireless telegraph apparatus as used in many commercial\r\nstations are shown in Fig. 416.\r\n\r\n     Alternating current at 110 volts is sent into the primary, _P_, of\r\n     a transformer, the secondary, _S_, of which produces a potential of\r\n     5000 to 20,000 volts. The secondary charges a condenser until its\r\n     potential becomes high enough to produce a discharge across a spark\r\n     gap, _SG_. This discharge is oscillatory, the frequency being at\r\n     the rate of about one million a second, depending upon the capacity\r\n     of the condenser and the induction of the circuit.\r\n\r\n     These oscillations pass through the primary of the oscillation\r\n     transformer, inducing in the secondary, electric oscillations which\r\n     surge back and forth through the antennæ, or aerial wires, _A_.\r\n     These oscillations set up the \"wireless waves.\" The production of\r\n     these waves is explained as follows: An electric current in a wire\r\n     sets up a magnetic field spreading out about the conductor; when\r\n     the current stops the field returns to the conductor and\r\n     disappears. The oscillations in the antennæ, however, have such a\r\n     high frequency, of the order of a million a second, that when one\r\n     surge of electricity sets up a magnetic field, the reverse surge\r\n     immediately following sets up an opposite magnetic field before the\r\n     first field can return to the wire. Under these conditions a\r\n     succession of oppositely directed magnetic fields are produced\r\n     which move out from the antennæ with the speed of light and induce\r\n     electric oscillations in any conductors cut by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 416.--Diagram of a commercial wireless telegraph\r\napparatus.]\r\n\r\n     While the electric waves are radiated in all directions from the\r\n     aerial, the _length_ of the waves set up is approximately four\r\n     times the combined length of the aerial wires and the \"lead in\"\r\n     connection to the oscillation transformer.\r\n\r\n     The electric waves induce effective electrical oscillations in the\r\n     aerial of the receiving station, even at distances of hundreds of\r\n     miles, provided the receiving transformer, _RT_, is \"tuned\" in\r\n     resonance with the transmitting apparatus by adjustments of the\r\n     variable condenser, _VC_, and the loading coil, _L_. The _detector_\r\n     of these oscillations in the receiving transformer is simply a\r\n     crystal of silicon or carborundum, _D_, in series with two\r\n     telephone receivers, _Ph_. The crystal detector permits the\r\n     electric oscillations to pass through it in one direction only. If\r\n     the crystal did not possess this property, the telephone could not\r\n     be used as a receiver as it cannot respond to high frequency\r\n     oscillations. While one spark passes at _SG_, an intermittent\r\n     current passes through the receiver in one direction. Since some\r\n     300 to 1200 sparks pass each second at _SG_ while the key, _K_, is\r\n     closed, the operator at _Ph_ hears a musical note of this frequency\r\n     as long as _K_ is depressed. Short and long tones then correspond\r\n     to the dots and dashes of ordinary telegraphy. In order to maintain\r\n     a _uniform tone a rotary spark gap_, as shown, is often used. This\r\n     insures a tone of fixed pitch by making uniform the rate of\r\n     producing sparks.\r\n\r\nThe _Continental_ instead of the _Morse_ code of signals is generally\r\nemployed in wireless telegraphy, since the former employs only _dots_\r\nand _dashes_. The latter code employs, in addition to dots and dashes,\r\n_spaces_ which have sometimes caused confusion in receiving wireless\r\nmessages. The United States government has adopted the regulations of\r\nthe _International Radio Congress_ which directs that commercial\r\ncompanies shall use wave lengths between 300 and 600 or above 1600\r\nmeters. Amateurs may use wave lengths less than 200 meters and no\r\nothers, while the government reserves the right to wave lengths of 600\r\nto 1600 meters. See p. 459 for Continental telegraph code.\r\n\r\n=418. Discharges in Rarefied Air.=--Fig. 417 represents a glass tube 60\r\nor more centimeters long, attached to an air pump. Connect the ends of\r\nthe tube to the terminals of a static machine or of an induction coil,\r\n_a-b_. At first no sparks will pass between _a_ and _f_, because of the\r\nhigh resistance of the air in the tube. Upon exhausting the air in the\r\ntube, however, the discharge begins to pass through it instead of\r\nbetween _a_ and _b_. This shows that an electrical discharge will pass\r\nmore readily through a partial vacuum than through air at ordinary\r\npressure. As the air becomes more and more exhausted, the character of\r\nthe discharge changes. At first it is a faint spark, gradually changing\r\nuntil it becomes a glow extending from one terminal to the other and\r\nnearly filling the tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 417.--An Aurora tube.]\r\n\r\n_Geissler tubes_ are tubes like the above. They are usually made of\r\ndifferent kinds of glass twisted into various shapes to produce\r\nbeautiful color effects. The _aurora borealis_ or northern light is\r\nsupposed to be electric discharges through rarefied air at the height of\r\nfrom 60 to 100 miles above the earth's magnetic poles. (See Fig. 418.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 418.--Aurora Borealis.]\r\n\r\n=419. Cathode Rays.=--When the tube in Art. 420 is exhausted to a\r\npressure of 0.001 mm., or a little less than one millionth of an\r\natmosphere, the character of the discharge is entirely changed. The\r\ntube becomes filled with a yellowish green phosphorescent light. This is\r\nproduced by what are called cathode rays striking the glass walls of the\r\ntube. These rays are called cathode rays because they come from the\r\ncathode of the tube. They are invisible and that they travel in straight\r\nlines is shown by the shadow obtained by using a tube with a screen\r\n(Fig. 419).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 419.--A cathode ray tube.]\r\n\r\n=420. \"X\" Rays.=--In 1895, Professor Röntgen of Wurtzburg, Germany,\r\ndiscovered that when the cathode rays strike the walls of the tube or\r\nany solid within it they excite a form of invisible radiation. This\r\nradiation is called Röntgen rays, or more commonly, \"X\" rays. Careful\r\nexperiments show that they travel in straight lines, and that they can\r\nnot be reflected or refracted as light waves are. They pass through\r\nglass and opaque objects such as flesh, cardboard, cloth, leather, etc.,\r\nbut not through metallic substances. The tube in Fig. 420 has a screen\r\ncovered with crystals which become luminous when struck by the cathode\r\nrays. On bringing a magnet near the tube the luminous line is raised or\r\nlowered showing that the magnetic field affects the stream of cathode\r\nrays, attracting it when in one position but repelling it when in the\r\nreverse direction. The cathode rays which cause the bright line possess\r\na negative charge of electricity. They are now believed to be electrons\r\nshot off from the surface of the cathode with speeds that may reach\r\n100,000 miles a second. \"X\" rays possess no electrical charge whatever\r\nand cannot be deflected by a magnet. They produce the same effect on a\r\nphotograph plate as light does, only more slowly. Hence, they can be\r\nused in taking \"X\" ray photographs. Certain crystals, like barium\r\nplatinum cyanide, fluoresce when struck by the \"X\" rays. The\r\n_fluoroscope_ is the name given to a light-tight box closed at one end\r\nby a cardboard covered with these crystals (Fig. 421). On looking into\r\nthe fluoroscope with an opaque object such as the hand placed between\r\nthe screen and the \"X\" ray tube, a shadow of the bones of the hand can\r\nbe seen upon the screen of the fluoroscope. (See Fig. 422.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 420.--The stream of cathode rays is deflected by a\r\nmagnet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 421.--A fluoroscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 422.--A view of the \"shadow\" of a hand as seen in a\r\nfluoroscope.]\r\n\r\nA special form of the tube is used. (See Fig. 423.) In this tube a\r\nplatinum disc is placed at the focus of the concave cathode. This\r\nconcentrates the \"X\" rays in one direction. It is now generally believed\r\nthat \"X\" rays are waves in the ether set up by the sudden stoppage of\r\nthe cathode rays at the platinum anode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 423.--An \"X\" ray tube.]\r\n\r\n=421. The Electromagnetic Theory of Light.=--The study of electric waves\r\nhas shown that they are similar to light waves in many respects: (a)\r\nthey have the same velocity; (b) they can be reflected and refracted.\r\nThe main difference is in their length, light waves being very much\r\nshorter. In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell, an English physicist, proposed the\r\ntheory that ether waves could be produced by electrical means and that\r\nlight waves are electromagnetic. In 1888 Hertz proved by his experiments\r\nthat ether waves having the same velocity as light could be produced in\r\nthis way. It is now the general belief that light waves are ether waves\r\nproduced by the vibrations of the electrons within the atoms and that\r\nthey consist of electromagnetic waves in the ether.\r\n\r\n=422. Radio-activity.=--In 1896 Henri Becquerel of Paris discovered that\r\nuranium and its compounds emit a form of radiation that produces an\r\neffect upon a photographic plate that is similar to that resulting from\r\nthe action of \"X\" rays. These rays are often called _Becquerel_ rays in\r\nhonor of their discoverer. The property of emitting such rays is called\r\n=radio-activity=, and the substances producing them are called\r\n=radio-active=.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, Professor and Mme. Curie after an investigation of all the\r\nelements found that _thorium_, one of the chief constituents of\r\nincandescent gas mantles, together with its compounds, was also\r\nradio-active. This may be shown by the following experiment:\r\n\r\n     Place a flattened gas mantle upon a photographic plate and leave in\r\n     a light tight-box for several days. Upon developing the plate in\r\n     the usual way a distinct image of the mantle will be found upon the\r\n     plate.\r\n\r\n=423. Radium.=--Mme. Curie discovered also that pitch-blende possessed\r\nmuch greater radio-active power than either thorium or uranium. After\r\nprolonged chemical experiments she obtained from several tons of the ore\r\na few milligrams of a substance more than a million times as active as\r\nthorium or uranium. She called this new substance _radium_. Radium is\r\ncontinually being decomposed, this decomposition being accompanied by\r\nthe production of a great deal of heat. It has been calculated that it\r\nwill take about 300 years for a particle of radium to be entirely\r\ndecomposed and separated into other substances. It is also believed that\r\nradium itself is the product of the decomposition of uranium, atomic\r\nweight 238, and that the final product of successive decompositions may\r\nbe some inert metal, like lead, atomic weight 207.\r\n\r\nThe radiation given off by radio-active substances consists of three\r\nkinds: (A) Positively charged particles of helium called _alpha_ rays:\r\n(B) negatively charged particles called _beta_ rays: (C) _gamma_ rays.\r\n\r\nThe alpha rays have little penetrating power, a sheet of paper or a\r\nsheet of aluminum 0.05 mm. stopping them. Upon losing their charges they\r\nbecome atoms of helium. Their velocity is about 1/10 of that of light or\r\n18,000 miles a second. The _spinthariscope_ is a little instrument\r\ndevised by Sir Williams Crookes in 1903 to show direct evidence that\r\nparticles are continually being shot off from radium. In this instrument\r\n(Fig. 424), a speck of radium _R_ is placed on the under side of a wire\r\nplaced a few millimeters above a screen _S_ covered with crystals of\r\nzinc sulphide. Looking in the dark at this screen through the lens _L_,\r\na continuous succession of sparks is seen like a swarm of fireflies on a\r\nwarm summer night. Each flash is due to an alpha particle striking the\r\nscreen. The beta rays are supposed to be cathode rays or electrons with\r\nvelocities of from 40,000 to 170,000 miles a second. The gamma rays are\r\nsupposed to be \"X\" rays produced by the beta rays striking solid\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 424.--A spinthariscope.]\r\n\r\n=424. The discovery of radio-activity= has revolutionized the ideas of\r\nthe constitution of matter. Further, the results of experiments upon\r\nradio-active materials reveals the presence of immense quantities of\r\nsub-atomic energy. If man ever discovers a means of utilizing this, he\r\nwill enter a storehouse of energy of far greater extent and value than\r\nany of which he has as yet made use. A consideration of this unexplored\r\nregion gives zest to the work of those who day by day are striving to\r\nunderstand and control forces of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\n1.

The study of Alternating Currents is also included\r\n     with the idea that it will make the text more complete and of wider\r\n     usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIRELESS TELEPHONY\r\n\r\n=425. The Wireless Telephone.=--One of the most important developments\r\nin wireless communication in recent years has been in wireless\r\ntelephony. We realize its possibilities, when we hear of the\r\nachievements of talking across an ocean or between airplanes and the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe wireless telephone can be best understood by comparing it with the\r\ncommon telephone. When the latter is in use, a direct current flows\r\ncontinually through the instrument. (See Arts. 312-316.) When a person\r\nspeaks into the transmitter, the sound waves of the voice cause the\r\ndiaphragm to vibrate, this action causes rapid changes in the\r\n_resistance_ of the transmitter, which in turn causes the direct current\r\nto fluctuate just in step with the pulses of the voice waves. This\r\nfluctuating direct current passes through the primary of an induction\r\ncoil, producing in the secondary an intensified alternating current.\r\nThis passes over the line wires to the receiver where it produces\r\nvariations in the magnetic field affecting the receiver diaphragm,\r\ncausing the latter to reproduce the voice of the person speaking in the\r\ntransmitter. Now to make the comparison clear, two facts must be noted\r\nwith regard to the wire telephone: first, there must be an action in the\r\ntransmitter which causes variations in a current through the instrument;\r\nsecond, this fluctuating current produces a more intense alternating\r\ncurrent which flows over the line and affects the receiver diaphragm,\r\nproducing there sound vibrations of greater intensity than those used at\r\nthe transmitter. This added energy comes from the current flowing\r\nthrough the transmitter. The case is analogous to that of an electric\r\nbell. The armature of the bell vibrates with greater energy than is\r\nrequired to push the button, the extra energy being derived from the\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\n=426. The Action of the Wireless Telephone.=--In the wireless telephone\r\nwe have a continuous stream of electric waves of high frequency. (See\r\nFig. 425_A_.) This stream of electric waves corresponds to the current\r\nthat flows through the transmitter in the wire telephone. These waves\r\nare of such high frequency that even though we had a receiver diaphragm\r\nvibrating in step with the waves, we could not hear the sound because\r\nthe human ear cannot hear a sound which consists of more than about\r\n40,000 vibrations per second. The sound waves act upon this stream of\r\nwaves very much, as in the wire telephone, the transmitter acts to\r\nmodify the line current. The impulses caused by the voice are much\r\nslower than the electric waves first mentioned and these slower impulses\r\nare reproduced in the receiver. Not only are these slower impulses\r\nreproduced but they are _amplified_, that is, produced with greater\r\nenergy than the impulses impressed on the stream of waves. Fig. 425_A_\r\nrepresents as nearly as is possible in a diagram the continuous stream\r\nof electric waves. Fig. 426_B_, represents the impulses produced by the\r\nsound alone, and Fig. 426_C_, shows how these voice impulses are\r\nimpressed on the stream of waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 425.--_A_, unmodified high frequency waves; _B_,\r\nwaves of voice frequency; _C_, high frequency waves modified by waves of\r\nvoice frequency.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 426.--Vacuum tube, transmitting type. (_Western\r\nElectric Co._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 427.--Vacuum tube, receiving type. (_Western\r\nElectric Co._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 428.--Diagram of wireless telephone transmitting\r\nset.]\r\n\r\n=427. The Vacuum Tube or Audion.=--The device by which all of this is\r\naccomplished is the _vacuum tube_. (See Fig. 426.) This tube contains\r\nthree electrodes. _First_, a _filament_ (_F_, in Fig. 428) which is\r\nheated by a current from a battery (_B_{1}_, Fig. 428) and because it is\r\nheated, sends out a stream of electrons. _Second_, the _plate_ which\r\nforms the anode of the circuit from battery, _B_{2}_. This plate\r\nreceives the electrons which are thrown off by the heated filament,\r\nhence a current flows through the circuit of _B_{2}_; the discharge\r\nthrough the tube depending on the e.m.f. between the filament and the\r\nplate. _Third_, a _grid_ is placed between the filament and the plate\r\nand is connected to the _secondary_ of the induction coil, the primary\r\nof which is connected to the transmitter. When the transmitter diaphragm\r\nis vibrating, the e.m.f. induced in the secondary of the induction coil\r\ncauses a variation in the potential of the grid. This means a variation\r\nin the electric field between the filament and the plate. (See Fig.\r\n428.) The changing electric field causes a variation in the discharge of\r\nelectrons through the tube; the variation corresponds to the vibrations\r\nof the transmitter diaphragm. This produces a surging current of the\r\nfrequency of the sound waves in the primary of the transformer (_T_,\r\nFig. 428). The secondary of this transformer is connected to the antennæ\r\n(_A_) and the earth (_E_). By means of the transformer, rapid surgings\r\nare set up in the antennæ and these surgings produce a continuous stream\r\nof electromagnetic waves which goes out in space. (Like Fig. 426_C_.)\r\nThese electromagnetic waves produce oscillations in the antennæ of a\r\nreceiving station. The antennæ transmit the impulses to a _tube_ (Fig.\r\n427) which acts as a _detector_, and makes possible the reproduction of\r\nthe sound by an ordinary telephone receiver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 429.--View of wireless telephone set.]\r\n\r\nThe _vacuum tube_ in the transmitting circuit also _amplifies_ the\r\nimpulses, that is, the energy of the waves given out is greater than\r\nthat of the impulses which produce them, the additional energy being\r\nderived from the battery sending current through the plate and filament.\r\nIn operation, the filament and the plate are connected to a battery with\r\na _condenser_ (_VC_) and an _inductance coil_ (_I_) in the circuit, as\r\nshown in Fig. 428. Photograph of a complete modern wireless telephone\r\nset is shown in Fig. 429.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNATING CURRENTS\r\n\r\n=428. Alternating currents= are of interest to us because of their\r\ngeneral commercial use. To understand the reason for the extensive\r\napplication of alternating currents it is necessary to learn the\r\nfundamental principles which pertain to them. The production of such\r\ncurrents has already been explained in Arts. 300-304. It should be\r\nremembered that the current developed in the armature of a dynamo is\r\nalternating. A dynamo may _deliver_ a direct or an alternating current,\r\ndepending on the method of collecting the current from the armature. If\r\na _commutator_ is used, the machine delivers _direct_ current, if _slip\r\nrings_ are employed, an _alternating_ current is delivered.\r\n\r\n=429. The Magnetic Field of an Alternating Current.=--The magnetic field\r\nof a direct current has been considered in Arts. 255-256. It has been\r\nshown to be arranged in circles about the conductor, according to the\r\n_Right Hand Rule_. (See Figs. 229 and 230.) These facts will help one to\r\nunderstand the following experiment:\r\n\r\n     If a number of magnetic compasses be arranged in a circle about a\r\n     straight vertical wire carrying a direct current, the compass\r\n     needles will point out a circle about the wire. (See Fig. 430,\r\n     _A_.) If now the current be reversed the compass needles will\r\n     reverse themselves and point in a direction just opposite to that\r\n     taken at first. (See Fig. 430, _B_.) This will be clear if you\r\n     imagine yourself walking around the wire in the direction the\r\n     compass needles pointed at first, and then walking around the wire\r\n     in the reverse direction. This illustrates what happens in the\r\n     field of an alternating current. The field reverses each time the\r\n     current reverses.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic field of an alternating current not only rapidly reverses\r\nitself, but also continually _changes in intensity_. At the instant when\r\nthe current reverses, the force of the magnetic field is zero since the\r\ncurrent at that instant is zero. As the current begins flowing and\r\nincreases to its maximum intensity, the magnetic field appears and\r\nincreases in intensity; and as the current decreases to zero, the\r\nmagnetic field changes in a similar manner. The field as it grows in\r\nstrength extends farther and farther from the wire, as it decreases in\r\nstrength it contracts or draws closer to the wire. Thus the magnetic\r\nfield may be said to expand and contract. We may picture the lines of\r\nforce as continually moving. In a typical a.-c. circuit, the complete\r\nseries of changes takes place in a small fraction of a second, and is\r\nrepeated many times over in a second. Contrast this with the magnetic\r\nfield of a constant direct current. Here the magnetic field has the same\r\ndirection as long as the current flows and does not change in strength.\r\nThis comparison is important because most of the differences between\r\ndirect and alternating currents depend on differences in the action of\r\ntheir magnetic fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 430.--Arrangement of compasses about a wire carrying\r\nan alternating current.]\r\n\r\n=430. Transformers.=--The transformer has been described in Arts.\r\n309-310. The principle of the transformer may be illustrated by the\r\nfollowing experiment:\r\n\r\n     A coil having several hundred turns of No. 18 d.c.c. copper wire is\r\n     placed over one arm of a \"U\" shaped iron core (see Fig. 431) and\r\n     then connected to a 110 volt a.-c. lighting circuit. Another coil\r\n     (_S_) having about 50 turns of No. 22 d.c.c. copper wire is\r\n     connected to an electric bell or buzzer, or a low voltage electric\r\n     light bulb. When the small coil is held over the other arm of the\r\n     \"U\" shaped iron core, the bell rings or the bulb glows. It is\r\n     evident that the electromotive force developed in the small coil\r\n     (_S_) is due to the alternating magnetic field surging back and\r\n     forth through the iron core. In Fig. 431 the core is \"open\" since\r\n     the magnetic field must pass through the air from one end of the\r\n     core to the other. A typical transformer has a _closed core_ to\r\n     provide a _closed magnetic circuit_. To secure this, take a\r\n     suitable bar of iron and lay across the end of the \"U\" shaped core,\r\n     and notice any change in the induced current produced in the small\r\n     coil, due to increased movement of magnetism through the closed\r\n     iron core.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 431.--Diagram of a transformer.]\r\n\r\nThis experiment illustrates the construction and action of a\r\ntransformer. In a commercial transformer, the two windings are on a\r\nclosed magnetic circuit. (See Figs. 304 and 305, p. 346.) To keep the\r\ncoils insulated, the transformer is placed in an iron \"housing\" and\r\ncovered with oil. These \"housings,\" or transformer cases are generally\r\nattached to poles near buildings in which alternating current is used.\r\n\r\n=431. Voltage Relation in a Transformer.=--In the experiment described\r\nabove, a bell was rung by an induced current produced in the secondary\r\ncoil. The induced e.m.f. was less than the voltage of the primary coil\r\npartly because there was some magnetic leakage, but mainly because\r\nthere were fewer turns of wire on the secondary. In a commercial\r\ntransformer the magnetic leakage is practically zero. In such a case,\r\nthe ratio of the number of turns on the primary coil to the number on\r\nthe secondary equals the ratio of the e.m.f. induced in the primary to\r\nthe e.m.f. induced in the secondary. Suppose, for example, we wish to\r\nmake a bell ringing transformer to use on a 110 volt lighting circuit,\r\n10 volts being required for the bell; the secondary will then need\r\none-eleventh of the number of turns of the primary. So that if 550 turns\r\nare on the primary, then 50 turns will be needed for the secondary. This\r\nwill be a \"step-down\" transformer. On the other hand, suppose we wish to\r\n\"step-up\" the voltage as is done in a certain power station where the\r\nvoltage of the generators is 6000 volts, the voltage being stepped up to\r\n44,000 by means of large transformers. This means that the secondary\r\ncoils have approximately 7-1/3 times as many turns as the primary.\r\n\r\n=432. Power Loss in a Transformer.=--When the voltage is \"stepped up\" in\r\na transformer, do we gain power? To answer this question we must\r\nremember that electric power does not depend on voltage alone but on the\r\n_product_ of e.m.f. and current intensity. (See Art. 291.) By tests with\r\na.-c. voltmeters and ammeters, we find that when the secondary e.m.f. is\r\n_greater_ than the primary e.m.f., the secondary current intensity is\r\n_less_ than that in the primary. It is also found that the _power_\r\ndeveloped is less than the power received by the transformer, _i.e._,\r\nthe \"output\" is less than the \"input\" as we would expect from the law of\r\nmachines. The power loss is mainly due to the work required to reverse\r\nthe magnetism, that is, to continually reverse the position of the iron\r\nmolecules. (See Art. 205.) The energy lost in this manner is known as\r\n\"core loss\" since it occurs in the iron core. The lost energy appears\r\nas heat. So much heat is developed in large transformers that special\r\nmeans of cooling are provided. In order to make the heat developed as\r\nsmall as possible, the cores are \"laminated\" (see Fig. 305, p. 346),\r\nthat is, built up of thin sheets of iron, because if the iron cores were\r\nsolid, the changing magnetic fields would induce electric currents in\r\nthe iron cores, which would produce an excessive amount of heat with a\r\ncorrespondingly large power loss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 432.--Diagram of \"bell-ringing\" transformer.]\r\n\r\n=433. Choke Coils and Inductance.=--If we refer to Fig. 432 we see that\r\nthe primary winding of the bell ringing transformer is connected across\r\nthe line. This winding forms a closed circuit whether the bell is\r\nringing or not. The resistance of this winding is small. Let us assume\r\nit to be one ohm. With a one ohm resistance connected across a 110 volt\r\nline we might expect a current of 110 amperes. This is certainly what we\r\nshould get if we were to connect a one ohm resistance across a line\r\nhaving 110 volts direct. The primary would form a short circuit if the\r\ncurrent were direct. But the fact is that practically no current flows\r\nthrough the primary winding when the bell is not ringing. Herein lies\r\none of the important differences between alternating and direct\r\ncurrents. With an alternating current the primary winding of our\r\ntransformer acts as a _choke coil_ and \"chokes\" down the current almost\r\nto zero. Let us see how this is done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 433.--A circuit containing a choke coil.]\r\n\r\nLet Fig. 433 represent a choke coil. Since alternating current is used,\r\nthe magnetic field is continually changing. Each turn of wire has its\r\nown magnetic field. The lines of force of turn number 1 expand and\r\ncontract and as they do so they move across turns 2, 3 and so on. In\r\nlike manner the lines of force from each turn of wire move across the\r\nother turns. In other words the coil is cutting its own lines of force.\r\nNow whenever an electric conductor cuts magnetic lines of force an\r\nelectromotive force is induced in the conductor. There is then an e.m.f.\r\ninduced in the coil by its own magnetic field. This induced e.m.f. on\r\nthe whole opposes the applied e.m.f.; in the primary of our bell ringing\r\ntransformer the induced e.m.f. opposes the e.m.f. of the line to such an\r\nextent as to reduce the current almost to zero. _Inductance_ is the\r\naction of an alternating current in inducing an opposing e.m.f. in the\r\ncoil in which the current is flowing. Since this opposing e.m.f. is\r\ninduced in the coil by its own magnetic field this action is also called\r\n_self-induction_. In a transformer the action of the field of the\r\nprimary upon the secondary is _mutual induction_; while the action of\r\nthe field of the primary in choking the current in the primary itself is\r\nself-induction or inductance. A coil having a single winding and used to\r\nintroduce inductance in a circuit is called a _choke coil_. A choke\r\ncoil inserted in a lamp circuit in series with the lamps dims the lamps\r\nbecause it reduces the intensity of the current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 434.--Diagram showing graphically an alternating\r\ncurrent with a \"lag\" of 30° behind its electromotive force.]\r\n\r\nSelf-induction causes the current to _lag_, that is, the current does\r\nnot quite reach its maximum at the instant the voltage reaches its\r\nmaximum. Fig. 434 shows graphically an e.m.f. and a lagging current. In\r\nthis figure the maximum current is shown following the maximum voltage\r\nat an interval of 30 degrees. In other words the armature in a two-pole\r\nfield must turn 30 degrees from the position of maximum voltage before\r\nthe current in the coil, where the self-induction occurs, reaches its\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\n=434. Reactance and Impedance.=--A choke coil has resistance as well as\r\ninductance. Its resistance can be found by the voltmeter-ammeter method,\r\nusing a direct current. (See Art. 278.) Let us take for example the\r\nprimary winding of a bell ringing transformer. Using a direct current\r\nand testing the coil with a voltmeter and ammeter we find its resistance\r\nto be, let us say, one ohm. If we connect the same coil across a 110\r\nvolt a.-c. line we find the current to be very small, say 0.05 ampere.\r\nThe coil now has resistance and _reactance_. Reactance is the effect of\r\nself-induction in hindering the flow of current. It is measured in ohms.\r\nThe combined effect of resistance and reactance is called _impedance_.\r\nIn the example above, the coil has 110 (volts)/0.05 (ampere) = 2200 ohms\r\nof impedance. In applying Ohm's law to an alternating current circuit,\r\nimpedance must be substituted for resistance. Ohm's law as applied to an\r\na-c. circuit should be stated: \"Current intensity equals e.m.f. divided\r\nby impedance\", or _I_ = _E_/_Z_. (_Z_ = impedance.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 435.--The relation between resistance, reactance and\r\nimpedance.]\r\n\r\nImpedance, however, does not equal the _sum_ of resistance and\r\nreactance. The relation between these three quantities is similar to\r\nthat between the three sides of a right triangle, in which the impedance\r\nrepresents the hypotenuse, and the resistance and reactance the other\r\ntwo sides. See Fig. 435 which indicates that Resistance² + Reactance² =\r\nImpedance², or (_R²_ + _X²_ = _Z²_). (_X_ = reactance.) To illustrate\r\nthis relation; suppose the primary of a transformer has 10 ohms\r\nimpedance and 8 ohms resistance, then the reactance equals 10² - 8² =\r\n6², or the reactance is 6 ohms.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n1. Find the reactance of a choke coil having a resistance of 10 ohms,\r\nwhen its impedance is 50 ohms. How great a current flows through this\r\ncoil if the terminal voltage is 110 volts?\r\n\r\n2. When the bell is ringing, the primary of a bell ringing transformer\r\nhas an appreciable current. Suppose this current is 0.2 ampere. What is\r\nthe impedance if the voltage of the line is 115 volts? What is the\r\nreactance if the resistance is 1 ohm?\r\n\r\n3. The primary of a large transformer has a terminal voltage of 6000\r\nvolts and a current of 600 amperes. What is the impedance? If the\r\nresistance is 6 ohms, what is the reactance?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 436.--A telephone set showing a condenser used in\r\nthe circuit of the \"ringer.\"]\r\n\r\n=435.--The electric condenser= (see Art. 231) is a very useful device in\r\na.-c. circuits; _e.g._, in telephone sets used in cities, a condenser is\r\nused in the ringing circuit, as shown in Fig. 436. Alternating current\r\nis required to ring such a bell and a condenser permits an a.-c. current\r\nto act through it, although it entirely prevents the flow of a direct\r\ncurrent. This peculiar action will now be explained.\r\n\r\n=436. The action of a condenser= in an alternating current circuit may\r\nbe illustrated by the following experiment. Connect twelve, 1 m.f.\r\n(microfarad) condensers, in parallel, and then attach them to a 110 volt\r\na.-c. line so that an incandescent lamp is in circuit as shown in Fig.\r\n437. The lamp will be found to glow brightly, although there is no\r\nelectrical connection between the two sets of condenser plates. If the\r\nsame arrangement is connected to a 110 volt direct current circuit, the\r\nlamp does not glow because it is really an open circuit. The lamp glows\r\non an a.-c. circuit because, although no electricity flows _through_ the\r\ncondenser, it does flow _into and out of_ the condenser, surging back\r\nand forth through the lamp with sufficient intensity to cause it to glow\r\nbrightly. When the a.-c. current moves one way in the circuit, one set\r\nof plates of the condensers becomes charged positively, the other,\r\nnegatively. When the a.-c. current reverses, the charges on the\r\ncondenser plates reverse. In the ordinary lighting circuit 120 reversals\r\ntake place each second, so that electricity rapidly flows into and out\r\nof the condensers. On removing one condenser after another from the\r\ncircuit, the lamp is found to glow less and less, till when but one\r\ncondenser is left, no glowing is observed, since one small condenser\r\ndoes not have sufficient _capacity_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 437.--Twelve condensers in circuit with an\r\nincandescent lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe unit of capacity is the _Farad_. Capacity is defined as the quantity\r\nof electricity per second that flows into a condenser when the voltage\r\nat the terminals changes at the rate of one volt per second. If a change\r\nof one volt per second causes one coulomb to flow per second, that is, a\r\ncurrent of one ampere, the capacity is one _farad_. The condensers used\r\nin the above experiment have a capacity of one microfarad, or one\r\nmillionth of a farad.\r\n\r\nA condenser, on account of its capacity, causes an a.-c. current to\r\n_lead_ the voltage, that is the current reaches its maximum value before\r\nthe voltage does. In this respect a condenser has an effect opposite to\r\nthat of the self-induction of a choke coil (the latter causing the\r\ncurrent to \"lag\"). (See Fig. 435.)\r\n\r\n=437. Transmission of Electric Power.=--A field of peculiar usefulness\r\nfor a.-c. currents is in the economical transmission of electric power.\r\nThis fact is due to the following reasons: (_a_) The loss of electrical\r\npower in a transmission line is due to the production of heat; the heat\r\nproduced being proportional to _I²R_, or to the _square_ of the _current\r\nintensity_. Any lessening of the current flow required to transmit a\r\ngiven power will therefore increase the efficiency of transmission.\r\n(_b_) In order to employ a small current in transmitting a large amount\r\nof power, we must use a very high e.m.f. Such high electromotive forces,\r\nsay from 60,000 to 100,000 volts, can be obtained only by the use of\r\na.-c. transformers, since it is not practicable to build a direct\r\ncurrent generator capable of producing 60,000 volts. In large power\r\ntransmission systems, a.-c. generators are used to produce powerful\r\nalternating currents. The e.m.f. is then stepped up to a suitable\r\nvoltage (2300-100,000) by transformers and sent over transmission lines\r\nto the various places where the power is to be used; at these places\r\nsuitable transformers \"step-down\" the e.m.f. to a convenient or safe\r\nvoltage for use. (See Fig. 442 of a transmission line and Fig. 438 of a\r\nlarge power transmission system, and Fig. 439 of an a.-c. generator and\r\npower plant.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 438.--Diagram of an alternating current high tension\r\npower system. (_A_) Alternator, (_Tu_) water turbine, direct connected\r\nto alternator, (_E_) exciter, (_T_{1}_) step-up transformers in power\r\nstation, (_T_{2}_) step-down transformers in substation, (_M_) motor,\r\n(_L_) lamps, single-phase, three-wire system, (_T_{3}_) step-down\r\ntransformers delivering three-phase current to rotary converter (_R_)\r\nwhich delivers direct current to the trolley line.]\r\n\r\n=438. Power Factor.=--The _power factor_ is a matter of interest and\r\nimportance in the use of a.-c. machines. Its meaning and use may be\r\nlearned from the following explanation: In a direct current circuit,\r\nwatts equals volts times amperes. In an alternating current circuit,\r\nthis equation is true only when the current is \"in step\" with the\r\nvoltage, that is, only when there is no _inductance_ or _capacity_ in\r\nthe circuit. If current and voltage are out of step, _i.e._, if there is\r\n_lag_ or _lead_ (see Fig. 434), the product of volts and amperes gives\r\nonly the _apparent power_, the ratio between true and apparent power\r\ndepending on the amount of lag or lead. This ratio is called the power\r\nfactor. In an a.-c. circuit, then, the power equation is: watts = volts\r\n× amperes × power factor, or power factor = true power/apparent power.\r\nThe product of volts and amperes is the _apparent power_ and is called\r\nvolt-amperes in distinction from the true power or watts. Therefore the\r\nfollowing is true: power factor = true watts/volt-amperes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 439.--Power house showing alternators, direct\r\nconnected to horizontal hydraulic turbines. Note the direct current\r\n\"exciter\" on end of shaft of alternator. (_Courtesy of General Electric\r\nCo._)]\r\n\r\n=439. Single-phase Currents.=--There are several kinds of a.-c.\r\ncurrents. One of the most common is the _single-phase_. It is simply the\r\ncommon a.-c. current used for light and power in the average home, and\r\nuses a two-wire circuit around which the current is rapidly alternating.\r\nFig. 440 illustrates the changes of e.m.f. in an a.-c. single-phase\r\ncurrent. It may be produced by a single coil rotating in a magnetic\r\nfield. The curve of Fig. 440 represents one _cycle_, that is, one\r\ncomplete series of changes in the electromotive forces. At the end of\r\nthe cycle the armature is in the same condition as at the beginning so\r\nfar as the magnetic field is concerned. It then begins a new cycle. The\r\nordinary commercial alternating current has a frequency of 60, that is\r\n60 cycles per second. One rotation produces as many cycles as there are\r\npairs of poles. For example, if there are 48 poles in the generator\r\nfield, one rotation produces 24 cycles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 440.--Graph showing the e.m.f. changes of a\r\nsingle-phase current for one \"cycle.\"]\r\n\r\n=440. Three-phase Currents.=--Now suppose we have three coils as in Fig.\r\n441, the coils being evenly spaced, or 120 degrees apart, at _A_, _B_,\r\nand _C_. If the coils are rotated in a magnetic field, each will produce\r\nan electromotive force. The result produced by three such coils is\r\ncalled a _three-phase_ current. Ordinarily six wires, or three circuits,\r\nwould be required to carry the current produced by three separate coils;\r\nfor when coil \"_C_\" is in the 90 degree position, where its e.m.f. is a\r\nmaximum, coil \"_B_\" is 120 degrees past its maximum, and coil \"_A_\" is\r\n240 degrees past its maximum. The graph (Fig. 441) shows the maximum\r\npoints of the three e.m.f's. separated by intervals of 120 degrees. In\r\npractice, however, it is found possible to use _three wires_ instead of\r\nsix, as explained in Art. 441.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 441.--Graph showing the e.m.f. changes of a\r\nthree-phase current for one \"cycle.\"]\r\n\r\n=441. Three-wire Transmission.=--The currents produced in the three\r\ncoils just described undergo precisely the same changes as those\r\nrepresented in the _graph_ (Fig. 441) for the three electromotive\r\nforces. Careful examination of the graph will show that at any point the\r\nsum of the _plus_ e.m.f's. equals the sum of the _minus_ e.m.f's. In\r\nother words the algebraic sum of the three e.m.f's. is zero. Therefore\r\nif we properly connect a transmission line of three wires to the\r\ngenerator, the sum of the currents leaving the generator will equal the\r\nsum of the currents returning to it. Since the algebraic sum of the\r\ncurrents produced by the three coil combination described in Art. 440 is\r\nalways zero, it is possible to use three wires on three-phase\r\ntransmission lines. Fig. 442 shows a \"tower\" carrying three, three-wire\r\ntransmission lines. Long distance, high tension transmission lines are\r\ngenerally three-wire lines carrying three-phase a.-c. currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 442.--A \"tower\" supporting three, three-phase\r\ncircuits of a high tension transmission line.]\r\n\r\n=442. Alternators.=--A dynamo which delivers alternating current is\r\nknown as an _alternator_. Commercial alternators have many pairs of\r\npoles in the field and as a rule the field rotates while the armature is\r\nstationary. The field must be supplied with _direct_ current for the\r\npolarity of each coil in the field must remain unchanged. Usually a\r\nseparate \"exciter\" is used, which is a small direct current generator.\r\nThe current from this exciter is fed into the rotating field by means of\r\nslip rings. Fig. 439 shows a d.-c. (direct current) exciter on the end\r\nof the armature shaft of the large alternator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 443.--Diagram of a \"Series Motor.\"]\r\n\r\n=443. The A.-C. Series Motors.=--The only type of motor that will run on\r\neither alternating or direct current is the _series motor_. The\r\n\"universal\" motor used in household appliances such as electric fans,\r\nvacuum cleaners, etc., is a series motor. The reason a series motor will\r\nrun on either direct or alternating current is because the direction of\r\nrotation of the armature of a motor depends on (_a_) the direction of\r\nthe current in the armature, and (_b_) the polarity of the field.\r\nReversing either of these alone, reverses the direction of rotation of\r\nthe armature, while reversing both at the same instant leaves the\r\ndirection of rotation unchanged. Fig. 443 is a diagram of a series motor\r\nsince the field coils and armature are connected in series. On an a.-c.\r\nline, both field and armature current must therefore reverse at the same\r\ninstant. In a shunt motor (similar to Fig. 286) we have a divided\r\ncircuit, and the greater self-induction of the field coils causes an\r\na.-c. current through these coils to lag behind that flowing in the\r\narmature so that the two currents do not reverse at the same instant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 444.--Diagram of a gramme ring. It is shown\r\nconnected to a single-phase current so as to produce a rotating magnetic\r\nfield, similar to that obtained with a three-phase current. (_Ahrens,\r\nHarley and Burns._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 445.--The \"stator\" of an induction motor.]\r\n\r\n=444. The Induction Motor.=--Another common type of a.-c. motor is the\r\n_induction motor_. Its advantage lies in its simplicity. It has neither\r\ncommutator nor brushes, the armature having no connection with an\r\nexternal circuit. If the wires of a three-phase line be connected to a\r\ncoil wound in the form of a _gramme ring_, the connections being 120\r\ndegrees apart as in Fig. 444, the magnetic field within this coil will\r\nchange in the same manner as if a magnet were spinning upon a pivot at\r\nthe center of the coil. Suppose the _N_ pole at one instant is at _A_,\r\nin one-third of a cycle it moves to _B_, in another third to _C_, and in\r\none cycle it makes a complete revolution. Thus we have a _rotating\r\nmagnetic field_. If a cup of some non-magnetic metal such as aluminium\r\nor copper be placed on a pivot in the center of this coil, the cup is\r\ncut by the moving lines of force and currents are induced in it.\r\nBecause of these currents, the cup has a magnetic field of its own, and\r\nthe action of the two magnetic fields is such as to pull the cup around\r\nand cause it to rotate in the same direction as that in which the field\r\nof the coil rotates. The coil represents the stationary part, the\r\n_stator_ (Fig. 445) and the cup the rotating part, the _rotor_, of an\r\ninduction motor. While the cup rotates in the same direction, it does\r\nnot rotate so rapidly as the magnetic field. If it should it is plain\r\nthat it would not cut the lines of force. The difference between the\r\nrate of rotation of the rotor and that of the magnetic field is called\r\nthe \"slip.\" The rotating part in small induction motors is frequently\r\nmade in a single casting. In large motors, it is built up of heavy\r\ncopper bars. Thus, from its appearance the common form of rotor is\r\nknown as the \"squirrel cage\" rotor. (See Fig. 446.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 446.--The \"rotor\" of an induction motor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 447.--Diagram illustrating the principle of the\r\nsynchronous motor. The armature coil passes the position shown in the\r\nfigure at the instant the current in the line reverses. Thus the\r\narmature keeps with the line current, making one revolution with each\r\n\"cycle.\"]\r\n\r\n=445. A synchronous motor= is one that keeps step with the alterations\r\nof an alternating current. The line current is fed into the armature by\r\nmeans of two slip rings and brushes. The principle of the synchronous\r\nmotor is illustrated in Fig. 447. This shows a motor having a two-pole\r\nfield. The armature current must be reversed twice in each revolution.\r\nThe reversal must take place when the armature winding is perpendicular\r\nto the lines of force of the field. In a direct current motor this\r\nreversal is brought about by the commutator. In a synchronous motor the\r\narmature reaches the 90 degree position at the exact instant at which\r\nthe current reverses in the line. Thus in the case of a two-pole motor\r\nthe armature must make exactly one revolution for each cycle; it is,\r\ntherefore, a constant speed motor. Such motors are frequently employed\r\nin converter stations where alternating current is converted into direct\r\ncurrent by what are called _rotary converters_.\r\n\r\nIn practice the synchronous motor has a number of pairs of field poles.\r\nIt is essentially an alternating current generator running as a motor.\r\nOne of the principal uses of the synchronous motor is that of a\r\nconverter, receiving alternating current and delivering direct current.\r\nSynchronous motors are also used in transmission lines to aid in\r\nmaintaining constant voltage.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Topics\r\n\r\nThe
