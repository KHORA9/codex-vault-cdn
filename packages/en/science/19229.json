Hitherto such forecasts have been presented almost\r\ninvariably in the form of fiction, and commonly the provocation of the\r\nsatirical opportunity has been too much for the writer;[2] the\r\nnarrative form becomes more and more of a nuisance as the speculative\r\ninductions become sincerer, and here it will be abandoned altogether in\r\nfavour of a texture of frank inquiries and arranged considerations. Our\r\nutmost aim is a rough sketch of the coming time, a prospectus, as it\r\nwere, of the joint undertaking of mankind in facing these impending\r\nyears. The reader is a prospective shareholder--he and his heirs--though\r\nwhether he will find this anticipatory balance-sheet to his belief or\r\nliking is another matter.\r\n\r\nFor reasons that will develop themselves more clearly as these papers\r\nunfold, it is extremely convenient to begin with a speculation upon the\r\nprobable developments and changes of the means of land locomotion\r\nduring the coming decades. No one who has studied the civil history of\r\nthe nineteenth century will deny how far-reaching the consequences of\r\nchanges in transit may be, and no one who has studied the military\r\nperformances of General Buller and General De Wet but will see that upon\r\ntransport, upon locomotion, may also hang the most momentous issues of\r\npolitics and war. The growth of our great cities, the rapid populating\r\nof America, the entry of China into the field of European politics are,\r\nfor example, quite obviously and directly consequences of new methods of\r\nlocomotion. And while so much hangs upon the development of these\r\nmethods, that development is, on the other hand, a process comparatively\r\nindependent, now at any rate, of most of the other great movements\r\naffected by it. It depends upon a sequence of ideas arising, and of\r\nexperiments made, and upon laws of political economy, almost as\r\ninevitable as natural laws. Such great issues, supposing them to be\r\npossible, as the return of Western Europe to the Roman communion, the\r\noverthrow of the British Empire by Germany, or the inundation of Europe\r\nby the \"Yellow Peril,\" might conceivably affect such details, let us\r\nsay, as door-handles and ventilators or mileage of line, but would\r\nprobably leave the essential features of the evolution of locomotion\r\nuntouched. The evolution of locomotion has a purely historical relation\r\nto the Western European peoples. It is no longer dependent upon them,\r\nor exclusively in their hands. The Malay nowadays sets out upon his\r\npilgrimage to Mecca in an excursion steamship of iron, and the\r\nimmemorial Hindoo goes a-shopping in a train, and in Japan and\r\nAustralasia and America, there are plentiful hands and minds to take up\r\nthe process now, even should the European let it fall.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this twentieth century happens to coincide with a very\r\ninteresting phase in that great development of means of land transit\r\nthat has been the distinctive feature (speaking materially) of the\r\nnineteenth century. The nineteenth century, when it takes its place with\r\nthe other centuries in the chronological charts of the future, will, if\r\nit needs a symbol, almost inevitably have as that symbol a steam engine\r\nrunning upon a railway. This period covers the first experiments, the\r\nfirst great developments, and the complete elaboration of that mode of\r\ntransit, and the determination of nearly all the broad features of this\r\ncentury's history may be traced directly or indirectly to that process.\r\nAnd since an interesting light is thrown upon the new phases in land\r\nlocomotion that are now beginning, it will be well to begin this\r\nforecast with a retrospect, and to revise very shortly the history of\r\nthe addition of steam travel to the resources of mankind.\r\n\r\nA curious and profitable question arises at once. How is it that the\r\nsteam locomotive appeared at the time it did, and not earlier in the\r\nhistory of the world?\r\n\r\nBecause it was not invented. But why was it not invented? Not for want\r\nof a crowning intellect, for none of the many minds concerned in the\r\ndevelopment strikes one--as the mind of Newton, Shakespeare, or Darwin\r\nstrikes one--as being that of an unprecedented man. It is not that the\r\nneed for the railway and steam engine had only just arisen, and--to use\r\none of the most egregiously wrong and misleading phrases that ever\r\ndropped from the lips of man--the demand created the supply; it was\r\nquite the other way about. There was really no urgent demand for such\r\nthings at the time; the current needs of the European world seem to have\r\nbeen fairly well served by coach and diligence in 1800, and, on the\r\nother hand, every administrator of intelligence in the Roman and Chinese\r\nempires must have felt an urgent need for more rapid methods of transit\r\nthan those at his disposal. Nor was the development of the steam\r\nlocomotive the result of any sudden discovery of steam. Steam, and\r\nsomething of the mechanical possibilities of steam, had been known for\r\ntwo thousand years; it had been used for pumping water, opening doors,\r\nand working toys, before the Christian era. It may be urged that this\r\nadvance was the outcome of that new and more systematic handling of\r\nknowledge initiated by Lord Bacon and sustained by the Royal Society;\r\nbut this does not appear to have been the case, though no doubt the new\r\nhabits of mind that spread outward from that centre played their part.\r\nThe men whose names are cardinal in the history of this development\r\ninvented, for the most part, in a quite empirical way, and Trevithick's\r\nengine was running along its rails and Evan's boat was walloping up the\r\nHudson a quarter of a century before Carnot expounded his general\r\nproposition. There were no such deductions from principles to\r\napplication as occur in the story of electricity to justify our\r\nattribution of the steam engine to the scientific impulse. Nor does this\r\nparticular invention seem to have been directly due to the new\r\npossibilities of reducing, shaping, and casting iron, afforded by the\r\nsubstitution of coal for wood in iron works; through the greater\r\ntemperature afforded by a coal fire. In China coal has been used in the\r\nreduction of iron for many centuries. No doubt these new facilities did\r\ngreatly help the steam engine in its invasion of the field of common\r\nlife, but quite certainly they were not sufficient to set it going. It\r\nwas, indeed, not one cause, but a very complex and unprecedented series\r\nof causes, that set the steam locomotive going. It was indirectly, and\r\nin another way, that the introduction of coal became the decisive\r\nfactor. One peculiar condition of its production in England seems to\r\nhave supplied just one ingredient that had been missing for two thousand\r\nyears in the group of conditions that were necessary before the steam\r\nlocomotive could appear.\r\n\r\nThis missing ingredient was a demand for some comparatively simple,\r\nprofitable machine, upon which the elementary principles of steam\r\nutilization could be worked out. If one studies Stephenson's \"Rocket\" in\r\ndetail, as one realizes its profound complexity, one begins to\r\nunderstand how impossible it would have been for that structure to have\r\ncome into existence _de novo_, however urgently the world had need of\r\nit. But it happened that the coal needed to replace the dwindling\r\nforests of this small and exceptionally rain-saturated country occurs in\r\nlow hollow basins overlying clay, and not, as in China and the\r\nAlleghanies for example, on high-lying outcrops, that can be worked as\r\nchalk is worked in England. From this fact it followed that some quite\r\nunprecedented pumping appliances became necessary, and the thoughts of\r\npractical men were turned thereby to the long-neglected possibilities of\r\nsteam. Wind was extremely inconvenient for the purpose of pumping,\r\nbecause in these latitudes it is inconstant: it was costly, too, because\r\nat any time the labourers might be obliged to sit at the pit's mouth for\r\nweeks together, whistling for a gale or waiting for the water to be got\r\nunder again. But steam had already been used for pumping upon one or two\r\nestates in England--rather as a toy than in earnest--before the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century, and the attempt to employ it was so obvious\r\nas to be practically unavoidable.[3] The water trickling into the coal\r\nmeasures[4] acted, therefore, like water trickling upon chemicals that\r\nhave long been mixed together dry and inert. Immediately the latent\r\nreactions were set going. Savery, Newcomen, a host of other workers,\r\nculminating in Watt, working always by steps that were at least so\r\nnearly obvious as to give rise again and again to simultaneous\r\ndiscoveries, changed this toy of steam into a real, a commercial thing,\r\ndeveloped a trade in pumping engines, created foundries and a new art of\r\nengineering, and almost unconscious of what they were doing, made the\r\nsteam locomotive a well-nigh unavoidable consequence. At last, after a\r\ncentury of improvement on pumping engines, there remained nothing but\r\nthe very obvious stage of getting the engine that had been developed on\r\nwheels and out upon the ways of the world.\r\n\r\nEver and again during the eighteenth century an engine would be put upon\r\nthe roads and pronounced a failure--one monstrous Palæoferric creature\r\nwas visible on a French high road as early as 1769--but by the dawn of\r\nthe nineteenth century the problem had very nearly got itself solved. By\r\n1804 Trevithick had a steam locomotive indisputably in motion and almost\r\nfinancially possible, and from his hands it puffed its way, slowly at\r\nfirst, and then, under Stephenson, faster and faster, to a transitory\r\nempire over the earth. It was a steam locomotive--but for all that it\r\nwas primarily _a steam engine for pumping_ adapted to a new end; it was\r\na steam engine whose ancestral stage had developed under conditions that\r\nwere by no means exacting in the matter of weight. And from that fact\r\nfollowed a consequence that has hampered railway travel and transport\r\nvery greatly, and that is tolerated nowadays only through a belief in\r\nits practical necessity. The steam locomotive was all too huge and heavy\r\nfor the high road--it had to be put upon rails. And so clearly linked\r\nare steam engines and railways in our minds that, in common language\r\nnow, the latter implies the former. But indeed it is the result of\r\naccidental impediments, of avoidable difficulties that we travel to-day\r\non rails.\r\n\r\nRailway travelling is at best a compromise. The quite conceivable ideal\r\nof locomotive convenience, so far as travellers are concerned, is surely\r\na highly mobile conveyance capable of travelling easily and swiftly to\r\nany desired point, traversing, at a reasonably controlled pace, the\r\nordinary roads and streets, and having access for higher rates of speed\r\nand long-distance travelling to specialized ways restricted to swift\r\ntraffic, and possibly furnished with guide-rails. For the collection and\r\ndelivery of all sorts of perishable goods also the same system is\r\nobviously altogether superior to the existing methods. Moreover, such a\r\nsystem would admit of that secular progress in engines and vehicles that\r\nthe stereotyped conditions of the railway have almost completely\r\narrested, because it would allow almost any new pattern to be put at\r\nonce upon the ways without interference with the established traffic.\r\nHad such an ideal been kept in view from the first the traveller would\r\nnow be able to get through his long-distance journeys at a pace of from\r\nseventy miles or more an hour without changing, and without any of the\r\ntrouble, waiting, expense, and delay that arises between the household\r\nor hotel and the actual rail. It was an ideal that must have been at\r\nleast possible to an intelligent person fifty years ago, and, had it\r\nbeen resolutely pursued, the world, instead of fumbling from compromise\r\nto compromise as it always has done and as it will do very probably for\r\nmany centuries yet, might have been provided to-day, not only with an\r\ninfinitely more practicable method of communication, but with one\r\ncapable of a steady and continual evolution from year to year.\r\n\r\nBut there was a more obvious path of development and one immediately\r\ncheaper, and along that path went short-sighted Nineteenth Century\r\nProgress, quite heedless of the possibility of ending in a _cul-de-sac_.\r\nThe first locomotives, apart from the heavy tradition of their ancestry,\r\nwere, like all experimental machinery, needlessly clumsy and heavy, and\r\ntheir inventors, being men of insufficient faith, instead of working for\r\nlightness and smoothness of motion, took the easier course of placing\r\nthem upon the tramways that were already in existence--chiefly for the\r\ntransit of heavy goods over soft roads. And from that followed a very\r\ninteresting and curious result.\r\n\r\nThese tram-lines very naturally had exactly the width of an ordinary\r\ncart, a width prescribed by the strength of one horse. Few people saw in\r\nthe locomotive anything but a cheap substitute for horseflesh, or found\r\nanything incongruous in letting the dimensions of a horse determine the\r\ndimensions of an engine. It mattered nothing that from the first the\r\npassenger was ridiculously cramped, hampered, and crowded in the\r\ncarriage. He had always been cramped in a coach, and it would have\r\nseemed \"Utopian\"--a very dreadful thing indeed to our grandparents--to\r\npropose travel without cramping. By mere inertia the horse-cart gauge,\r\nthe 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge, _nemine contradicente_, established itself in\r\nthe world, and now everywhere the train is dwarfed to a scale that\r\nlimits alike its comfort, power, and speed. Before every engine, as it\r\nwere, trots the ghost of a superseded horse, refuses most resolutely to\r\ntrot faster than fifty miles an hour, and shies and threatens\r\ncatastrophe at every point and curve. That fifty miles an hour, most\r\nauthorities are agreed, is the limit of our speed for land travel, so\r\nfar as existing conditions go.[5] Only a revolutionary reconstruction of\r\nthe railways or the development of some new competing method of land\r\ntravel can carry us beyond that.\r\n\r\nPeople of to-day take the railways for granted as they take sea and sky;\r\nthey were born in a railway world, and they expect to die in one. But if\r\nonly they will strip from their eyes the most blinding of all\r\ninfluences, acquiescence in the familiar, they will see clearly enough\r\nthat this vast and elaborate railway system of ours, by which the whole\r\nworld is linked together, is really only a vast system of trains of\r\nhorse-waggons and coaches drawn along rails by pumping-engines upon\r\nwheels. Is that, in spite of its present vast extension, likely to\r\nremain the predominant method of land locomotion--even for so short a\r\nperiod as the next hundred years?\r\n\r\nNow, so much capital is represented by the existing type of railways,\r\nand they have so firm an establishment in the acquiescence of men, that\r\nit is very doubtful if the railways will ever attempt any very\r\nfundamental change in the direction of greater speed or facility, unless\r\nthey are first exposed to the pressure of our second alternative,\r\ncompetition, and we may very well go on to inquire how long will it be\r\nbefore that second alternative comes into operation--if ever it is to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what other possibilities seem to offer themselves. Let\r\nus revert to the ideal we have already laid down, and consider what\r\nhopes and obstacles to its attainment there seem to be. The abounding\r\npresence of numerous experimental motors to-day is so stimulating to the\r\nimagination, there are so many stimulated persons at work upon them,\r\nthat it is difficult to believe the obvious impossibility of most of\r\nthem--their convulsiveness, clumsiness, and, in many cases, exasperating\r\ntrail of stench will not be rapidly fined away.[6] I do not think that\r\nit is asking too much of the reader's faith in progress to assume that\r\nso far as a light powerful engine goes, comparatively noiseless,\r\nsmooth-running, not obnoxious to sensitive nostrils, and altogether\r\nsuitable for high road traffic, the problem will very speedily be\r\nsolved. And upon that assumption, in what direction are these new motor\r\nvehicles likely to develop? how will they react upon the railways? and\r\nwhere finally will they take us?\r\n\r\nAt present they seem to promise developments upon three distinct and\r\ndefinite lines.\r\n\r\nThere will, first of all, be the motor truck for heavy traffic. Already\r\nsuch trucks are in evidence distributing goods and parcels of various\r\nsorts. And sooner or later, no doubt, the numerous advantages of such an\r\narrangement will lead to the organization of large carrier companies,\r\nusing such motor trucks to carry goods in bulk or parcels on the high\r\nroads. Such companies will be in an exceptionally favourable position to\r\norganize storage and repair for the motors of the general public on\r\nprofitable terms, and possibly to co-operate in various ways with the\r\nmanufactures of special types of motor machines.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, and parallel with the motor truck, there will develop\r\nthe hired or privately owned motor carriage. This, for all except the\r\nlongest journeys, will add a fine sense of personal independence to all\r\nthe small conveniences of first-class railway travel. It will be capable\r\nof a day's journey of three hundred miles or more, long before the\r\ndevelopments to be presently foreshadowed arrive. One will change\r\nnothing--unless it is the driver--from stage to stage. One will be free\r\nto dine where one chooses, hurry when one chooses, travel asleep or\r\nawake, stop and pick flowers, turn over in bed of a morning and tell the\r\ncarriage to wait--unless, which is highly probable, one sleeps\r\naboard.[7]...\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly there will be the motor omnibus, attacking or developing out\r\nof the horse omnibus companies and the suburban lines. All this seems\r\nfairly safe prophesying.\r\n\r\nAnd these things, which are quite obviously coming even now, will be\r\nworking out their many structural problems when the next phase in their\r\ndevelopment begins. The motor omnibus companies competing against the\r\nsuburban railways will find themselves hampered in the speed of their\r\nlonger runs by the slower horse traffic on their routes, and they will\r\nattempt to secure, and, it may be, after tough legislative struggles,\r\nwill secure the power to form private roads of a new sort, upon which\r\ntheir vehicles will be free to travel up to the limit of their very\r\nhighest possible speed. It is along the line of such private tracks and\r\nroads that the forces of change will certainly tend to travel, and along\r\nwhich I am absolutely convinced they will travel. This segregation of\r\nmotor traffic is probably a matter that may begin even in the present\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\nOnce this process of segregation from the high road of the horse and\r\npedestrian sets in, it will probably go on rapidly. It may spread out\r\nfrom short omnibus routes, much as the London Metropolitan Railway\r\nsystem has spread. The motor carrier companies, competing in speed of\r\ndelivery with the quickened railways, will conceivably co-operate with\r\nthe long-distance omnibus and the hired carriage companies in the\r\nformation of trunk lines. Almost insensibly, certain highly profitable\r\nlonger routes will be joined up--the London to Brighton, for example, in\r\nEngland. And the quiet English citizen will, no doubt, while these\r\nthings are still quite exceptional and experimental in his lagging land,\r\nread one day with surprise in the violently illustrated popular\r\nmagazines of 1910, that there are now so many thousand miles of these\r\nroads already established in America and Germany and elsewhere. And\r\nthereupon, after some patriotic meditations, he may pull himself\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWe may even hazard some details about these special roads. For example,\r\nthey will be very different from macadamized roads; they will be used\r\nonly by soft-tired conveyances; the battering horseshoes, the perpetual\r\nfilth of horse traffic, and the clumsy wheels of laden carts will never\r\nwear them. It may be that they will have a surface like that of some\r\ncycle-racing tracks, though since they will be open to wind and weather,\r\nit is perhaps more probable they will be made of very good asphalt\r\nsloped to drain, and still more probable that they will be of some quite\r\nnew substance altogether--whether hard or resilient is beyond my\r\nforetelling. They will have to be very wide--they will be just as wide\r\nas the courage of their promoters goes--and if the first made are too\r\nnarrow there will be no question of gauge to limit the later ones. Their\r\ntraffic in opposite directions will probably be strictly separated, and\r\nit will no doubt habitually disregard complicated and fussy regulations\r\nimposed under the initiative of the Railway Interest by such official\r\nbodies as the Board of Trade. The promoters will doubtless take a hint\r\nfrom suburban railway traffic and from the current difficulty of the\r\nMetropolitan police, and where their ways branch the streams of traffic\r\nwill not cross at a level but by bridges. It is easily conceivable that\r\nonce these tracks are in existence, cyclists and motors other than those\r\nof the constructing companies will be able to make use of them. And,\r\nmoreover, once they exist it will be possible to experiment with\r\nvehicles of a size and power quite beyond the dimensions prescribed by\r\nour ordinary roads--roads whose width has been entirely determined by\r\nthe size of a cart a horse can pull.[8]\r\n\r\nCountless modifying influences will, of course, come into operation. For\r\nexample, it has been assumed, perhaps rashly, that the railway influence\r\nwill certainly remain jealous and hostile to these growths: that what\r\nmay be called the \"Bicycle Ticket Policy\" will be pursued throughout.\r\nAssuredly there will be fights of a very complicated sort at first, but\r\nonce one of these specialized lines is in operation, it may be that some\r\nat least of the railway companies will hasten to replace their flanged\r\nrolling stock by carriages with rubber tyres, remove their rails,\r\nbroaden their cuttings and embankments, raise their bridges, and take to\r\nthe new ways of traffic. Or they may find it answer to cut fares, widen\r\ntheir gauges, reduce their gradients, modify their points and curves,\r\nand woo the passenger back with carriages beautifully hung and\r\nsumptuously furnished, and all the convenience and luxury of a club. Few\r\npeople would mind being an hour or so longer going to Paris from London,\r\nif the railway travelling was neither rackety, cramped, nor tedious. One\r\ncould be patient enough if one was neither being jarred, deafened, cut\r\ninto slices by draughts, and continually more densely caked in a filthy\r\ndust of coal; if one could write smoothly and easily at a steady table,\r\nread papers, have one's hair cut, and dine in comfort[9]--none of which\r\nthings are possible at present, and none of which require any new\r\ninventions, any revolutionary contrivances, or indeed anything but an\r\nintelligent application of existing resources and known principles. Our\r\nrage for fast trains, so far as long-distance travel is concerned, is\r\nlargely a passion to end the extreme discomfort involved. It is in the\r\ndaily journey, on the suburban train, that daily tax of time, that\r\nspeed is in itself so eminently desirable, and it is just here that the\r\nconditions of railway travel most hopelessly fail. It must always be\r\nremembered that the railway train, as against the motor, has the\r\nadvantage that its wholesale traction reduces the prime cost by\r\ndemanding only one engine for a great number of coaches. This will not\r\nserve the first-class long-distance passenger, but it may the third.\r\nAgainst that economy one must balance the necessary delay of a\r\nrelatively infrequent service, which latter item becomes relatively\r\ngreater and greater in proportion to the former, the briefer the journey\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be that many railways, which are neither capable of\r\nmodification into suburban motor tracks, nor of development into\r\nluxurious through routes, will find, in spite of the loss of many\r\nelements of their old activity, that there is still a profit to be made\r\nfrom a certain section of the heavy goods traffic, and from cheap\r\nexcursions. These are forms of work for which railways seem to be\r\nparticularly adapted, and which the diversion of a great portion of\r\ntheir passenger traffic would enable them to conduct even more\r\nefficiently. It is difficult to imagine, for example, how any sort of\r\nroad-car organization could beat the railways at the business of\r\ndistributing coal and timber and similar goods, which are taken in bulk\r\ndirectly from the pit or wharf to local centres of distribution.\r\n\r\nIt must always be remembered that at the worst the defeat of such a\r\ngreat organization as the railway system does not involve its\r\ndisappearance until a long period has elapsed. It means at first no more\r\nthan a period of modification and differentiation. Before extinction can\r\nhappen a certain amount of wealth in railway property must absolutely\r\ndisappear. Though under the stress of successful competition the capital\r\nvalue of the railways may conceivably fall, and continue to fall,\r\ntowards the marine store prices, fares and freights pursue the sweated\r\nworking expenses to the vanishing point, and the land occupied sink to\r\nthe level of not very eligible building sites: yet the railways will,\r\nnevertheless, continue in operation until these downward limits are\r\npositively attained.\r\n\r\nAn imagination prone to the picturesque insists at this stage upon a\r\nvision of the latter days of one of the less happily situated lines.\r\nAlong a weedy embankment there pants and clangs a patched and tarnished\r\nengine, its paint blistered, its parts leprously dull. It is driven by\r\nan aged and sweated driver, and the burning garbage of its furnace\r\ndistils a choking reek into the air. A huge train of urban dust trucks\r\nbangs and clatters behind it, _en route_ to that sequestered dumping\r\nground where rubbish is burnt to some industrial end. But that is a\r\nlapse into the merely just possible, and at most a local tragedy. Almost\r\ncertainly the existing lines of railway will develop and differentiate,\r\nsome in one direction and some in another, according to the nature of\r\nthe pressure upon them. Almost all will probably be still in existence\r\nand in divers ways busy, spite of the swarming new highways I have\r\nventured to foreshadow, a hundred years from now.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we have to contemplate, not so much a supersession of the\r\nrailways as a modification and specialization of them in various\r\ndirections, and the enormous development beside them of competing and\r\nsupplementary methods. And step by step with these developments will\r\ncome a very considerable acceleration of the ferry traffic of the narrow\r\nseas through such improvements as the introduction of turbine engines.\r\nSo far as the high road and the longer journeys go this is the extent of\r\nour prophecy.[10]\r\n\r\nBut in the discussion of all questions of land locomotion one must come\r\nat last to the knots of the network, to the central portions of the\r\ntowns, the dense, vast towns of our time, with their high ground values\r\nand their narrow, already almost impassable, streets. I hope at a later\r\nstage to give some reasons for anticipating that the centripetal\r\npressure of the congested towns of our epoch may ultimately be very\r\ngreatly relieved, but for the next few decades at least the usage of\r\nexisting conditions will prevail, and in every town there is a certain\r\nnucleus of offices, hotels, and shops upon which the centrifugal forces\r\nI anticipate will certainly not operate. At present the streets of many\r\nlarger towns, and especially of such old-established towns as London,\r\nwhose central portions have the narrowest arteries, present a quite\r\nunprecedented state of congestion. When the Green of some future\r\n_History of the English People_ comes to review our times, he will, from\r\nhis standpoint of comfort and convenience, find the present streets of\r\nLondon quite or even more incredibly unpleasant than are the filthy\r\nkennels, the mudholes and darkness of the streets of the seventeenth\r\ncentury to our enlightened minds. He will echo our question, \"Why _did_\r\npeople stand it?\" He will be struck first of all by the omnipresence of\r\nmud, filthy mud, churned up by hoofs and wheels under the inclement\r\nskies, and perpetually defiled and added to by innumerable horses.\r\nImagine his description of a young lady crossing the road at the Marble\r\nArch in London, on a wet November afternoon, \"breathless, foul-footed,\r\nsplashed by a passing hansom from head to foot, happy that she has\r\nreached the further pavement alive at the mere cost of her ruined\r\nclothes.\"... \"Just where the bicycle might have served its most useful\r\npurpose,\" he will write, \"in affording a healthy daily ride to the\r\ninnumerable clerks and such-like sedentary toilers of the central\r\nregion, it was rendered impossible by the danger of side-slip in this\r\nvast ferocious traffic.\" And, indeed, to my mind at least, this last is\r\nthe crowning absurdity of the present state of affairs, that the clerk\r\nand the shop hand, classes of people positively starved of exercise,\r\nshould be obliged to spend yearly the price of a bicycle upon a\r\nseason-ticket, because of the quite unendurable inconvenience and danger\r\nof urban cycling.\r\n\r\nNow, in what direction will matters move? The first and most obvious\r\nthing to do, the thing that in many cases is being attempted and in a\r\nfutile, insufficient way getting itself done, the thing that I do not\r\nfor one moment regard as the final remedy, is the remedy of the\r\narchitect and builder--profitable enough to them, anyhow--to widen the\r\nstreets and to cut \"new arteries.\" Now, every new artery means a series\r\nof new whirlpools of traffic, such as the pensive Londoner may study for\r\nhimself at the intersection of Shaftesbury Avenue with Oxford Street,\r\nand unless colossal--or inconveniently steep--crossing-bridges are made,\r\nthe wider the affluent arteries the more terrible the battle of the\r\ntraffic. Imagine Regent's Circus on the scale of the Place de la\r\nConcorde. And there is the value of the ground to consider; with every\r\nincrement of width the value of the dwindling remainder in the meshes\r\nof the network of roads will rise, until to pave the widened streets\r\nwith gold will be a mere trifling addition to the cost of their\r\n\"improvement.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, however, quite another direction in which the congestion may\r\nfind relief, and that is in the \"regulation\" of the traffic. This has\r\nalready begun in London in an attack on the crawling cab and in the new\r\nbye-laws of the London County Council, whereby certain specified forms\r\nof heavy traffic are prohibited the use of the streets between ten and\r\nseven. These things may be the first beginning of a process of\r\nrestriction that may go far. Many people living at the present time, who\r\nhave grown up amidst the exceptional and possibly very transient\r\ncharacteristics of this time, will be disposed to regard the traffic in\r\nthe streets of our great cities as a part of the natural order of\r\nthings, and as unavoidable as the throng upon the pavement. But indeed\r\nthe presence of all the chief constituents of this vehicular\r\ntorrent--the cabs and hansoms, the vans, the omnibuses--everything,\r\nindeed, except the few private carriages--are as novel, as distinctively\r\nthings of the nineteenth century, as the railway train and the needle\r\ntelegraph. The streets of the great towns of antiquity, the streets of\r\nthe great towns of the East, the streets of all the mediæval towns, were\r\nnot intended for any sort of wheeled traffic at all--were designed\r\nprimarily and chiefly for pedestrians. So it would be, I suppose, in any\r\none's ideal city. Surely Town, in theory at least, is a place one walks\r\nabout as one walks about a house and garden, dressed with a certain\r\nceremonious elaboration, safe from mud and the hardship and defilement\r\nof foul weather, buying, meeting, dining, studying, carousing, seeing\r\nthe play. It is the growth in size of the city that has necessitated the\r\ngrowth of this coarser traffic that has made \"Town\" at last so utterly\r\ndetestable.\r\n\r\nBut if one reflects, it becomes clear that, save for the vans of goods,\r\nthis moving tide of wheeled masses is still essentially a stream of\r\nurban pedestrians, pedestrians who, by reason of the distances they have\r\nto go, have had to jump on 'buses and take cabs--in a word, to bring in\r\nthe high road to their aid. And the vehicular traffic of the street is\r\nessentially the high road traffic very roughly adapted to the new needs.\r\nThe cab is a simple development of the carriage, the omnibus of the\r\ncoach, and the supplementary traffic of the underground and electric\r\nrailways is a by no means brilliantly imagined adaptation of the\r\nlong-route railway. These are all still new things, experimental to the\r\nhighest degree, changing and bound to change much more, in the period of\r\nspecialization that is now beginning.\r\n\r\nNow, the first most probable development is a change in the omnibus and\r\nthe omnibus railway. A point quite as important with these means of\r\ntransit as actual speed of movement is frequency: time is wasted\r\nabundantly and most vexatiously at present in waiting and in\r\naccommodating one's arrangements to infrequent times of call and\r\ndeparture. _The more frequent a local service, the more it comes to be\r\nrelied upon._ Another point--and one in which the omnibus has a great\r\nadvantage over the railway--is that it should be possible to get on and\r\noff at any point, or at as many points on the route as possible. But\r\nthis means a high proportion of stoppages, and this is destructive to\r\nspeed. There is, however, one conceivable means of transit that is not\r\nsimply frequent but continuous, that may be joined or left at any point\r\nwithout a stoppage, that could be adapted to many existing streets at\r\nthe level or quite easily sunken in tunnels, or elevated above the\r\nstreet level,[11] and that means of transit is the moving platform,\r\nwhose possibilities have been exhibited to all the world in a sort of\r\nmean caricature at the Paris Exhibition. Let us imagine the inner circle\r\nof the district railway adapted to this conception. I will presume that\r\nthe Parisian \"rolling platform\" is familiar to the reader. The district\r\nrailway tunnel is, I imagine, about twenty-four feet wide. If we suppose\r\nthe space given to six platforms of three feet wide and one (the most\r\nrapid) of six feet, and if we suppose each platform to be going four\r\nmiles an hour faster than its slower fellow (a velocity the Paris\r\nexperiment has shown to be perfectly comfortable and safe), we should\r\nhave the upper platform running round the circle at a pace of\r\ntwenty-eight miles an hour. If, further, we adopt an ingenious\r\nsuggestion of Professor Perry's, and imagine the descent to the line\r\nmade down a very slowly rotating staircase at the centre of a big\r\nrotating wheel-shaped platform, against a portion of whose rim the\r\nslowest platform runs in a curve, one could very easily add a speed of\r\nsix or eight miles an hour more, and to that the man in a hurry would be\r\nable to add his own four miles an hour by walking in the direction of\r\nmotion. If the reader is a traveller, and if he will imagine that black\r\nand sulphurous tunnel, swept and garnished, lit and sweet, with a train\r\nmuch faster than the existing underground trains perpetually ready to go\r\noff with him and never crowded--if he will further imagine this train a\r\nplatform set with comfortable seats and neat bookstalls and so forth, he\r\nwill get an inkling in just one detail of what he perhaps misses by\r\nliving now instead of thirty or forty years ahead.\r\n\r\nI have supposed the replacement to occur in the case of the London Inner\r\nCircle Railway, because there the necessary tunnel already exists to\r\nhelp the imagination of the English reader, but that the specific\r\nreplacement will occur is rendered improbable by the fact that the\r\ncircle is for much of its circumference entangled with other lines of\r\ncommunication--the North-Western Railway, for example. As a matter of\r\nfact, as the American reader at least will promptly see, the much more\r\npracticable thing is that upper footpath, with these moving platforms\r\nbeside it, running out over the street after the manner of the viaduct\r\nof an elevated railroad. But in some cases, at any rate, the\r\ndemonstrated cheapness and practicability of tunnels at a considerable\r\ndepth will come into play.\r\n\r\nWill this diversion of the vast omnibus traffic of to-day into the air\r\nand underground, together with the segregation of van traffic to\r\nspecific routes and times, be the only change in the streets of the new\r\ncentury? It may be a shock, perhaps, to some minds, but I must confess I\r\ndo not see what is to prevent the process of elimination that is\r\nbeginning now with the heavy vans spreading until it covers all horse\r\ntraffic, and with the disappearance of horse hoofs and the necessary\r\nfilth of horses, the road surface may be made a very different thing\r\nfrom what it is at present, better drained and admirably adapted for the\r\nsoft-tired hackney vehicles and the torrent of cyclists. Moreover, there\r\nwill be little to prevent a widening of the existing side walks, and the\r\nprotection of the passengers from rain and hot sun by awnings, or such\r\narcades as distinguish Turin, or Sir F. Bramwell's upper footpaths on\r\nthe model of the Chester rows. Moreover, there is no reason but the\r\nexisting filth why the roadways should not have translucent _velaria_ to\r\npull over in bright sunshine and wet weather. It would probably need\r\nless labour to manipulate such contrivances than is required at present\r\nfor the constant conflict with slush and dust. Now, of course, we\r\ntolerate the rain, because it facilitates a sort of cleaning process....\r\n\r\nEnough of this present speculation. I have indicated now the general\r\nlines of the roads and streets and ways and underways of the Twentieth\r\nCentury. But at present they stand vacant in our prophecy, not only\r\nawaiting the human interests--the characters and occupations, and\r\nclothing of the throng of our children and our children's children that\r\nflows along them, but also the decorations our children's children's\r\ntaste will dictate, the advertisements their eyes will tolerate, the\r\nshops in which they will buy. To all that we shall finally come, and\r\neven in the next chapter I hope it will be made more evident how\r\nconveniently these later and more intimate matters follow, instead of\r\npreceding, these present mechanical considerations. And of the beliefs\r\nand hopes, the thought and language, the further prospects of this\r\nmultitude as yet unborn--of these things also we shall make at last\r\ncertain hazardous guesses. But at first I would submit to those who may\r\nfind the \"machinery in motion\" excessive in this chapter, we must have\r\nthe background and fittings--the scene before the play.[12]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In the earlier papers, of which this is the first, attention will be\r\ngiven to the probable development of the civilized community in general.\r\nAfterwards these generalizations will be modified in accordance with\r\ncertain broad differences of race, custom, and religion.\r\n\r\n[2] Of quite serious forecasts and inductions of things to come, the\r\nnumber is very small indeed; a suggestion or so of Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer's, Mr. Kidd's _Social Evolution_, some hints from Mr. Archdall\r\nReid, some political forecasts, German for the most part (Hartmann's\r\n_Earth in the Twentieth Century_, e.g.), some incidental forecasts by\r\nProfessor Langley (_Century Magazine_, December, 1884, e.g.), and such\r\nisolated computations as Professor Crookes' wheat warning, and the\r\nvarious estimates of our coal supply, make almost a complete\r\nbibliography. Of fiction, of course, there is abundance: _Stories of the\r\nYear_ 2000, and _Battles of Dorking_, and the like--I learn from Mr.\r\nPeddie, the bibliographer, over one hundred pamphlets and books of that\r\ndescription. But from its very nature, and I am writing with the\r\nintimacy of one who has tried, fiction can never be satisfactory in this\r\napplication. Fiction is necessarily concrete and definite; it permits of\r\nno open alternatives; its aim of illusion prevents a proper amplitude of\r\ndemonstration, and modern prophecy should be, one submits, a branch of\r\nspeculation, and should follow with all decorum the scientific method.\r\nThe very form of fiction carries with it something of disavowal; indeed,\r\nvery much of the Fiction of the Future pretty frankly abandons the\r\nprophetic altogether, and becomes polemical, cautionary, or idealistic,\r\nand a mere footnote and commentary to our present discontents.\r\n\r\n[3] It might have been used in the same way in Italy in the first\r\ncentury, had not the grandiose taste for aqueducts prevailed.\r\n\r\n[4] And also into the Cornwall mines, be it noted.\r\n\r\n[5] It might be worse. If the biggest horses had been Shetland ponies,\r\nwe should be travelling now in railway carriages to hold two each side\r\nat a maximum speed of perhaps twenty miles an hour. There is hardly any\r\nreason, beyond this tradition of the horse, why the railway carriage\r\nshould not be even nine or ten feet wide, the width, that is, of the\r\nsmallest room in which people can live in comfort, hung on such springs\r\nand wheels as would effectually destroy all vibration, and furnished\r\nwith all the equipment of comfortable chambers.\r\n\r\n[6] Explosives as a motive power were first attempted by Huyghens and\r\none or two others in the seventeenth century, and, just as with the\r\nturbine type of apparatus, it was probably the impetus given to the\r\ndevelopment of steam by the convenient collocation of coal and water and\r\nthe need of an engine, that arrested the advance of this parallel\r\ninquiry until our own time. Explosive engines, in which gas and\r\npetroleum are employed, are now abundant, but for all that we can regard\r\nthe explosive engine as still in its experimental stages. So far,\r\nresearch in explosives has been directed chiefly to the possibilities of\r\nhigher and still higher explosives for use in war, the neglect of the\r\nmechanical application of this class of substance being largely due to\r\nthe fact, that chemists are not as a rule engineers, nor engineers\r\nchemists. But an easily portable substance, the decomposition of which\r\nwould evolve energy, or--what is, from the practical point of view, much\r\nthe same thing--an easily portable substance, which could be decomposed\r\nelectrically by wind or water power, and which would then recombine and\r\nsupply force, either in intermittent thrusts at a piston, or as an\r\nelectric current, would be infinitely more convenient for all locomotive\r\npurposes than the cumbersome bunkers and boilers required by steam. The\r\npresumption is altogether in favour of the possibility of such\r\nsubstances. Their advent will be the beginning of the end for steam\r\ntraction on land and of the steam ship at sea: the end indeed of the Age\r\nof Coal and Steam. And even with regard to steam there may be a curious\r\nchange of method before the end. It is beginning to appear that, after\r\nall, the piston and cylinder type of engine is, for locomotive\r\npurposes--on water at least, if not on land--by no means the most\r\nperfect. Another, and fundamentally different type, the turbine type, in\r\nwhich the impulse of the steam spins a wheel instead of shoving a\r\npiston, would appear to be altogether better than the adapted pumping\r\nengine, at any rate, for the purposes of steam navigation. Hero, of\r\nAlexandria, describes an elementary form of such an engine, and the\r\nearly experimenters of the seventeenth century tried and abandoned the\r\nrotary principle. It was not adapted to pumping, and pumping was the\r\nonly application that then offered sufficient immediate encouragement to\r\npersistence. The thing marked time for quite two centuries and a half,\r\ntherefore, while the piston engines perfected themselves; and only in\r\nthe eighties did the requirements of the dynamo-electric machine open a\r\n\"practicable\" way of advance. The motors of the dynamo-electric machine\r\nin the nineteenth century, in fact, played exactly the _rôle_ of the\r\npumping engine in the eighteenth, and by 1894 so many difficulties of\r\ndetail had been settled, that a syndicate of capitalists and scientific\r\nmen could face the construction of an experimental ship. This ship, the\r\n_Turbinia_, after a considerable amount of trial and modification,\r\nattained the unprecedented speed of 34½ knots an hour, and His Majesty's\r\nnavy has possessed, in the _Turbinia's_ younger and greater sister, the\r\n_Viper_, now unhappily lost, a torpedo-destroyer capable of 41 miles an\r\nhour. There can be little doubt that the sea speeds of 50 and even 60\r\nmiles an hour will be attained within the next few years. But I do not\r\nthink that these developments will do more than delay the advent of the\r\n\"explosive\" or \"storage of force\" engine.\r\n\r\n[7] The historian of the future, writing about the nineteenth century,\r\nwill, I sometimes fancy, find a new meaning in a familiar phrase. It is\r\nthe custom to call this the most \"Democratic\" age the world has ever\r\nseen, and most of us are beguiled by the etymological contrast, and the\r\nmemory of certain legislative revolutions, to oppose one form of\r\nstupidity prevailing to another, and to fancy we mean the opposite to an\r\n\"Aristocratic\" period. But indeed we do not. So far as that political\r\npoint goes, the Chinaman has always been infinitely more democratic than\r\nthe European. But the world, by a series of gradations into error, has\r\ncome to use \"Democratic\" as a substitute for \"Wholesale,\" and as an\r\nopposite to \"Individual,\" without realizing the shifted application at\r\nall. Thereby old \"Aristocracy,\" the organization of society for the\r\nglory and preservation of the Select Dull, gets to a flavour even of\r\nfreedom. When the historian of the future speaks of the past century as\r\na Democratic century, he will have in mind, more than anything else, the\r\nunprecedented fact that we seemed to do everything in heaps--we read in\r\nepidemics; clothed ourselves, all over the world, in identical fashions;\r\nbuilt and furnished our houses in stereo designs; and travelled--that\r\nnaturally most individual proceeding--in bales. To make the railway\r\ntrain a perfect symbol of our times, it should be presented as\r\nuncomfortably full in the third class--a few passengers standing--and\r\neverybody reading the current number either of the _Daily Mail_,\r\n_Pearson's Weekly_, _Answers_, _Tit Bits_, or whatever Greatest Novel of\r\nthe Century happened to be going.... But, as I hope to make clearer in\r\nmy later papers, this \"Democracy,\" or Wholesale method of living, like\r\nthe railways, is transient--a first makeshift development of a great and\r\nfinally (to me at least) quite hopeful social reorganization.\r\n\r\n[8] So we begin to see the possibility of laying that phantom horse that\r\nhaunts the railways to this day so disastrously.\r\n\r\n[9] A correspondent, Mr. Rudolf Cyrian, writes to correct me here, and I\r\ncannot do better, I think, than thank him and quote what he says. \"It is\r\nhardly right to state that fifty miles an hour 'is the limit of our\r\nspeed for land travel, so far as existing conditions go.' As far as\r\nEnglish traffic is concerned, the statement is approximately correct. In\r\nthe United States, however, there are several trains running now which\r\naverage over considerable distances more than sixty miles an hour,\r\nstoppages included, nor is there much reason why this should not be\r\nconsiderably increased. What especially hampers the development of\r\nrailways in England--as compared with other countries--is the fact that\r\nthe rolling-stock templet is too small. Hence carriages in England have\r\nto be narrower and lower than carriages in the United States, although\r\nboth run on the same standard gauge (4 feet 8½ inches). The result is\r\nthat several things which you describe as not possible at present, such\r\nas to 'write smoothly and easily at a steady table, read papers, have\r\none's hair cut, and dine in comfort,' are not only feasible, but\r\nactually attained on some of the good American trains. For instance, on\r\nthe _present_ Empire State Express, running between New York and\r\nBuffalo, or on the _present_ Pennsylvania, Limited, running between New\r\nYork and Chicago, and on others. With the Pennsylvania, Limited, travel\r\nstenographers and typewriters, whose services are placed at the disposal\r\nof passengers free of charge. But the train on which there is the least\r\nvibration of any is probably the new Empire State Express, and on this\r\nit is certainly possible to write smoothly and easily at a steady\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\n[10] Since this appeared in the _Fortnightly Review_ I have had the\r\npleasure of reading 'Twentieth Century Inventions,' by Mr. George\r\nSutherland, and I find very much else of interest bearing on these\r\nquestions--the happy suggestion (for the ferry transits, at any rate) of\r\na rail along the sea bottom, which would serve as a guide to swift\r\nsubmarine vessels, out of reach of all that superficial \"motion\" that is\r\nso distressing, and of all possibilities of collision.\r\n\r\n[11] To the level of such upper story pavements as Sir F. Bramwell has\r\nproposed for the new Holborn to Strand Street, for example.\r\n\r\n[12] I have said nothing in this chapter, devoted to locomotion, of the\r\ncoming invention of flying. This is from no disbelief in its final\r\npracticability, nor from any disregard of the new influences it will\r\nbring to bear upon mankind. But I do not think it at all probable that\r\naeronautics will ever come into play as a serious modification of\r\ntransport and communication--the main question here under consideration.\r\nMan is not, for example, an albatross, but a land biped, with a\r\nconsiderable disposition towards being made sick and giddy by unusual\r\nmotions, and however he soars he must come to earth to live. We must\r\nbuild our picture of the future from the ground upward; of flying--in\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE PROBABLE DIFFUSION OF GREAT CITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, the velocity at which a man and his belongings may pass about the\r\nearth is in itself a very trivial matter indeed, but it involves certain\r\nother matters not at all trivial, standing, indeed, in an almost\r\nfundamental relation to human society. It will be the business of this\r\nchapter to discuss the relation between the social order and the\r\navailable means of transit, and to attempt to deduce from the principles\r\nelucidated the coming phases in that extraordinary expansion, shifting\r\nand internal redistribution of population that has been so conspicuous\r\nduring the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the broad features of the redistribution of the\r\npopulation that has characterized the nineteenth century. It may be\r\nsummarized as an unusual growth of great cities and a slight tendency to\r\ndepopulation in the country. The growth of the great cities is the\r\nessential phenomenon. These aggregates having populations of from eight\r\nhundred thousand upward to four and five millions, are certainly, so far\r\nas the world outside the limits of the Chinese empire goes, entirely an\r\nunprecedented thing. Never before, outside the valleys of the three\r\ngreat Chinese rivers, has any city--with the exception of Rome and\r\nperhaps (but very doubtfully) of Babylon--certainly had more than a\r\nmillion inhabitants, and it is at least permissible to doubt whether the\r\npopulation of Rome, in spite of its exacting a tribute of sea-borne food\r\nfrom the whole of the Mediterranean basin, exceeded a million for any\r\ngreat length of time.[13] But there are now ten town aggregates having a\r\npopulation of over a million, nearly twenty that bid fair to reach that\r\nlimit in the next decade, and a great number at or approaching a\r\nquarter of a million. We call these towns and cities, but, indeed, they\r\nare of a different order of things to the towns and cities of the\r\neighteenth-century world.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the aggregation of people about this new sort of\r\ncentre, there has been, it is alleged, a depletion of the country\r\nvillages and small townships. But, so far as the counting of heads goes,\r\nthis depletion is not nearly so marked as the growth of the great towns.\r\nRelatively, however, it is striking enough.\r\n\r\nNow, is this growth of large towns really, as one may allege, a result\r\nof the development of railways in the world, or is it simply a change in\r\nhuman circumstances that happens to have arisen at the same time? It\r\nneeds only a very general review of the conditions of the distribution\r\nof population to realize that the former is probably the true answer.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to make the issue part of a more general\r\nproposition, namely, that _the general distribution of population in a\r\ncountry must always be directly dependent on transport facilities_. To\r\nillustrate this point roughly we may build up an imaginary simple\r\ncommunity by considering its needs. Over an arable country-side, for\r\nexample, inhabited by a people who had attained to a level of\r\nagricultural civilization in which war was no longer constantly\r\nimminent, the population would be diffused primarily by families and\r\ngroups in farmsteads. It might, if it were a very simple population, be\r\nalmost all so distributed. But even the simplest agriculturists find a\r\ncertain convenience in trade. Certain definite points would be\r\nconvenient for such local trade and intercourse as the people found\r\ndesirable, and here it is that there would arise the germ of a town. At\r\nfirst it might be no more than an appointed meeting place, a market\r\nsquare, but an inn and a blacksmith would inevitably follow, an altar,\r\nperhaps, and, if these people had writing, even some sort of school. It\r\nwould have to be where water was found, and it would have to be\r\ngenerally convenient of access to its attendant farmers.\r\n\r\nNow, if this meeting place was more than a certain distance from any\r\nparticular farm, it would be inconvenient for that farmer to get himself\r\nand his produce there and back, and to do his business in a comfortable\r\ndaylight. He would not be able to come and, instead, he would either\r\nhave to go to some other nearer centre to trade and gossip with his\r\nneighbours or, failing this, not go at all. Evidently, then, there would\r\nbe a maximum distance between such places. This distance in England,\r\nwhere traffic has been mainly horse traffic for many centuries, seems to\r\nhave worked out, according to the gradients and so forth, at from eight\r\nto fifteen miles, and at such distances do we find the country towns,\r\nwhile the horseless man, the serf, and the labourer and labouring wench\r\nhave marked their narrow limits in the distribution of the intervening\r\nvillages. If by chance these gathering places have arisen at points\r\nmuch closer than this maximum, they have come into competition, and one\r\nhas finally got the better of the other, so that in England the\r\ndistribution is often singularly uniform. Agricultural districts have\r\ntheir towns at about eight miles, and where grazing takes the place of\r\nthe plough, the town distances increase to fifteen.[14] And so it is,\r\nentirely as a multiple of horse and foot strides, that all the villages\r\nand towns of the world's country-side have been plotted out.[15]\r\n\r\nA third, and almost final, factor determining town distribution in a\r\nworld without railways, would be the seaport and the navigable river.\r\nPorts would grow into dimensions dependent on the population of the\r\nconveniently accessible coasts (or river-banks), and on the quality and\r\nquantity of their products, and near these ports, as the conveniences of\r\ncivilization increased, would appear handicraft towns--the largest\r\npossible towns of a foot-and-horse civilization--with industries of such\r\na nature as the produce of their coasts required.\r\n\r\nIt was always in connection with a port or navigable river that the\r\ngreater towns of the pre-railway periods arose, a day's journey away\r\nfrom the coast when sea attack was probable, and shifting to the coast\r\nitself when that ceased to threaten. Such sea-trading handicraft towns\r\nas Bruges, Venice, Corinth, or London were the largest towns of the\r\nvanishing order of things. Very rarely, except in China, did they\r\nclamber above a quarter of a million inhabitants, even though to some of\r\nthem there was presently added court and camp. In China, however, a\r\ngigantic river and canal system, laced across plains of extraordinary\r\nfertility, has permitted the growth of several city aggregates with\r\npopulations exceeding a million, and in the case of the Hankow trinity\r\nof cities exceeding five million people.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the position and the population limit was entirely\r\ndetermined by the accessibility of the town and the area it could\r\ndominate for the purposes of trade. And not only were the commercial or\r\nnatural towns so determined, but the political centres were also finally\r\nchosen for strategic considerations, in a word--communications. And now,\r\nperhaps, the real significance of the previous paper, in which sea\r\nvelocities of fifty miles an hour, and land travel at the rate of a\r\nhundred, and even cab and omnibus journeys of thirty or forty miles,\r\nwere shown to be possible, becomes more apparent.\r\n\r\nAt the first sight it might appear as though the result of the new\r\ndevelopments was simply to increase the number of giant cities in the\r\nworld by rendering them possible in regions where they had hitherto been\r\nimpossible--concentrating the trade of vast areas in a manner that had\r\nhitherto been entirely characteristic of navigable waters. It might seem\r\nas though the state of affairs in China, in which population has been\r\nconcentrated about densely-congested \"million-cities,\" with pauper\r\nmasses, public charities, and a crowded struggle for existence, for many\r\nhundreds of years, was merely to be extended over the whole world. We\r\nhave heard so much of the \"problem of our great cities\"; we have the\r\nimpressive statistics of their growth; the belief in the inevitableness\r\nof yet denser and more multitudinous agglomerations in the future is so\r\nwidely diffused, that at first sight it will be thought that no other\r\nmotive than a wish to startle can dictate the proposition that not only\r\nwill many of these railway-begotten \"giant cities\" reach their maximum\r\nin the commencing century, but that in all probability they, and not\r\nonly they, but their water-born prototypes in the East also, are\r\ndestined to such a process of dissection and diffusion as to amount\r\nalmost to obliteration, so far, at least, as the blot on the map goes,\r\nwithin a measurable further space of years.\r\n\r\nIn advancing this proposition, the present writer is disagreeably aware\r\nthat in this matter he has expressed views entirely opposed to those he\r\nnow propounds; and in setting forth the following body of\r\nconsiderations he tells the story of his own disillusionment. At the\r\noutset he took for granted--and, very naturally, he wishes to imagine\r\nthat a great number of other people do also take for granted--that the\r\nfuture of London, for example, is largely to be got as the answer to a\r\nsort of rule-of-three sum. If in one hundred years the population of\r\nLondon has been multiplied by seven, then in two hundred years--! And\r\none proceeds to pack the answer in gigantic tenement houses, looming\r\nupon colossal roofed streets, provide it with moving ways (the only\r\navailable transit appliances suited to such dense multitudes), and\r\ndevelop its manners and morals in accordance with the laws that will\r\nalways prevail amidst over-crowded humanity so long as humanity endures.\r\nThe picture of this swarming concentrated humanity has some effective\r\npossibilities, but, unhappily, if, instead of that obvious rule-of-three\r\nsum, one resorts to an analysis of operating causes, its plausibility\r\ncrumbles away, and it gives place to an altogether different forecast--a\r\nforecast, indeed, that is in almost violent contrast to the first\r\nanticipation. It is much more probable that these coming cities will not\r\nbe, in the old sense, cities at all; they will present a new and\r\nentirely different phase of human distribution.\r\n\r\nThe determining factor in the appearance of great cities in the past,\r\nand, indeed, up to the present day, has been the meeting of two or more\r\ntransit lines, the confluence of two or more streams of trade, and easy\r\ncommunication. The final limit to the size and importance of the great\r\ncity has been the commercial \"sphere of influence\" commanded by that\r\ncity, the capacity of the alluvial basin of its commerce, so to speak,\r\nthe volume of its river of trade. About the meeting point so determined\r\nthe population so determined has grouped itself--and this is the point I\r\noverlooked in those previous vaticinations--in accordance with _laws\r\nthat are also considerations of transit_.\r\n\r\nThe economic centre of the city is formed, of course, by the wharves and\r\nlanding places--and in the case of railway-fed cities by the\r\ntermini--where passengers land and where goods are landed, stored, and\r\ndistributed. Both the administrative and business community, traders,\r\nemployers, clerks, and so forth, must be within a convenient access of\r\nthis centre; and the families, servants, tradesmen, amusement purveyors\r\ndependent on these again must also come within a maximum distance. At a\r\ncertain stage in town growth the pressure on the more central area would\r\nbecome too great for habitual family life there, and an office region\r\nwould differentiate from an outer region of homes. Beyond these two\r\nzones, again, those whose connection with the great city was merely\r\nintermittent would constitute a system of suburban houses and areas.\r\nBut the grouping of these, also, would be determined finally by the\r\nconvenience of access to the dominant centre. That secondary centres,\r\nliterary, social, political, or military, may arise about the initial\r\ntrade centre, complicates the application but does not alter the\r\nprinciple here stated. They must all be within striking distance. The\r\nday of twenty-four hours is an inexorable human condition, and up to the\r\npresent time all intercourse and business has been broken into spells of\r\ndefinite duration by intervening nights. Moreover, almost all effective\r\nintercourse has involved personal presence at the point where\r\nintercourse occurs. The possibility, therefore, of going and coming and\r\ndoing that day's work has hitherto fixed the extreme limits to which a\r\ncity could grow, and has exacted a compactness which has always been\r\nvery undesirable and which is now for the first time in the world's\r\nhistory no longer imperative.\r\n\r\nSo far as we can judge without a close and uncongenial scrutiny of\r\nstatistics, that daily journey, that has governed and still to a very\r\nconsiderable extent governs the growth of cities, has had, and probably\r\nalways will have, a maximum limit of two hours, one hour each way from\r\nsleeping place to council chamber, counter, workroom, or office stool.\r\nAnd taking this assumption as sound, we can state precisely the maximum\r\narea of various types of town. A pedestrian agglomeration such as we\r\nfind in China, and such as most of the European towns probably were\r\nbefore the nineteenth century, would be swept entirely by a radius of\r\nfour miles about the business quarter and industrial centre; and, under\r\nthese circumstances, where the area of the feeding regions has been very\r\nlarge the massing of human beings has probably reached its extreme\r\nlimit.[16] Of course, in the case of a navigable river, for example, the\r\ncommercial centre might be elongated into a line and the circle of the\r\ncity modified into an ellipse with a long diameter considerably\r\nexceeding eight miles, as, for example, in the case of Hankow.\r\n\r\nIf, now, horseflesh is brought into the problem, an outer radius of six\r\nor eight miles from the centre will define a larger area in which the\r\ncarriage folk, the hackney users, the omnibus customers, and their\r\ndomestics and domestic camp followers may live and still be members of\r\nthe city. Towards that limit London was already probably moving at the\r\naccession of Queen Victoria, and it was clearly the absolute limit of\r\nurban growth--until locomotive mechanisms capable of more than eight\r\nmiles an hour could be constructed.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came suddenly the railway and the steamship, the former\r\nopening with extraordinary abruptness a series of vast through-routes\r\nfor trade, the latter enormously increasing the security and economy of\r\nthe traffic on the old water routes. For a time neither of these\r\ninventions was applied to the needs of intra-urban transit at all. For a\r\ntime they were purely centripetal forces. They worked simply to increase\r\nthe general volume of trade, to increase, that is, the pressure of\r\npopulation upon the urban centres. As a consequence the social history\r\nof the middle and later thirds of the nineteenth century, not simply in\r\nEngland but all over the civilized world, is the history of a gigantic\r\nrush of population into the magic radius of--for most people--four\r\nmiles, to suffer there physical and moral disaster less acute but,\r\nfinally, far more appalling to the imagination than any famine or\r\npestilence that ever swept the world. Well has Mr. George Gissing named\r\nnineteenth-century London in one of his great novels the \"Whirlpool,\"\r\nthe very figure for the nineteenth-century Great City, attractive,\r\ntumultuous, and spinning down to death.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, these great cities are no permanent maëlstroms. These new\r\nforces, at present still so potently centripetal in their influence,\r\nbring with them, nevertheless, the distinct promise of a centrifugal\r\napplication that may be finally equal to the complete reduction of all\r\nour present congestions. The limit of the pre-railway city was the limit\r\nof man and horse. But already that limit has been exceeded, and each day\r\nbrings us nearer to the time when it will be thrust outward in every\r\ndirection with an effect of enormous relief.\r\n\r\nSo far the only additions to the foot and horse of the old dispensation\r\nthat have actually come into operation, are the suburban railways, which\r\nrender possible an average door to office hour's journey of ten or a\r\ndozen miles--further only in the case of some specially favoured\r\nlocalities. The star-shaped contour of the modern great city, thrusting\r\nout arms along every available railway line, knotted arms of which every\r\nknot marks a station, testify sufficiently to the relief of pressure\r\nthus afforded. Great Towns before this century presented rounded\r\ncontours and grew as a puff-ball swells; the modern Great City looks\r\nlike something that has burst an intolerable envelope and splashed. But,\r\nas our previous paper has sought to make clear, these suburban railways\r\nare the mere first rough expedient of far more convenient and rapid\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nWe are--as the Census Returns for 1901 quite clearly show--in the early\r\nphase of a great development of centrifugal possibilities. And since it\r\nhas been shown that a city of pedestrians is inexorably limited by a\r\nradius of about four miles, and that a horse-using city may grow out to\r\nseven or eight, it follows that the available area of a city which can\r\noffer a cheap suburban journey of thirty miles an hour is a circle with\r\na radius of thirty miles. And is it too much, therefore, in view of all\r\nthat has been adduced in this and the previous paper, to expect that\r\nthe available area for even the common daily toilers of the great city\r\nof the year 2000, or earlier, will have a radius very much larger even\r\nthan that? Now, a circle with a radius of thirty miles gives an area of\r\nover 2800 square miles, which is almost a quarter that of Belgium. But\r\nthirty miles is only a very moderate estimate of speed, and the reader\r\nof the former paper will agree, I think, that the available area for the\r\nsocial equivalent of the favoured season-ticket holders of to-day will\r\nhave a radius of over one hundred miles, and be almost equal to the area\r\nof Ireland.[17] The radius that will sweep the area available for such\r\nas now live in the outer suburbs will include a still vaster area.\r\nIndeed, it is not too much to say that the London citizen of the year\r\n2000 A.D. may have a choice of nearly all England and Wales south of\r\nNottingham and east of Exeter as his suburb, and that the vast stretch\r\nof country from Washington to Albany will be all of it \"available\" to\r\nthe active citizen of New York and Philadelphia before that date.\r\n\r\nThis does not for a moment imply that cities of the density of our\r\nexisting great cities will spread to these limits. Even if we were to\r\nsuppose the increase of the populations of the great cities to go on at\r\nits present rate, this enormous extension of available area would still\r\nmean a great possibility of diffusion. But though most great cities are\r\nprobably still very far from their maxima, though the network of feeding\r\nrailways has still to spread over Africa and China, and though huge\r\nareas are still imperfectly productive for want of a cultivating\r\npopulation, yet it is well to remember that for each great city, quite\r\nirrespective of its available spaces, a maximum of population is fixed.\r\nEach great city is sustained finally by the trade and production of a\r\ncertain proportion of the world's surface--by the area it commands\r\ncommercially. The great city cannot grow, except as a result of some\r\nquite morbid and transitory process--to be cured at last by famine and\r\ndisorder--beyond the limit the commercial capacity of that commanded\r\narea prescribes. Long before the population of this city, with its inner\r\ncircle a third of the area of Belgium, rose towards the old-fashioned\r\ncity density, this restriction would come in. Even if we allowed for\r\nconsiderable increase in the production of food stuffs in the future, it\r\nstill remains inevitable that the increase of each city in the world\r\nmust come at last upon arrest.\r\n\r\nYet, though one may find reasons for anticipating that this city will in\r\nthe end overtake and surpass that one and such-like relative\r\nprophesying, it is difficult to find any data from which to infer the\r\nabsolute numerical limits of these various diffused cities. Or perhaps\r\nit is more seemly to admit that no such data have occurred to the\r\nwriter. So far as London, St. Petersburg, and Berlin go, it seems fairly\r\nsafe to assume that they will go well over twenty millions; and that New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, and Chicago will probably, and Hankow almost\r\ncertainly, reach forty millions. Yet even forty millions over thirty-one\r\nthousand square miles of territory is, in comparison with four millions\r\nover fifty square miles, a highly diffused population.\r\n\r\nHow far will that possible diffusion accomplish itself? Let us first of\r\nall consider the case of those classes that will be free to exercise a\r\nchoice in the matter, and we shall then be in a better position to\r\nconsider those more numerous classes whose general circumstances are\r\npractically dictated to them. What will be the forces acting upon the\r\nprosperous household, the household with a working head and four hundred\r\na year and upwards to live upon, in the days to come? Will the resultant\r\nof these forces be, as a rule, centripetal or centrifugal? Will such\r\nhouseholders in the greater London of 2000 A.D. still cluster for the\r\nmost part, as they do to-day, in a group of suburbs as close to London\r\nas is compatible with a certain fashionable maximum of garden space and\r\nair; or will they leave the ripened gardens and the no longer brilliant\r\nvillas of Surbiton and Norwood, Tooting and Beckenham, to other and less\r\nindependent people? First, let us weigh the centrifugal attractions.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is what is known as the passion for nature, that\r\npassion for hillside, wind, and sea that is evident in so many people\r\nnowadays, either frankly expressed or disguising itself as a passion for\r\ngolfing, fishing, hunting, yachting, or cycling; and, secondly, there is\r\nthe allied charm of cultivation, and especially of gardening, a charm\r\nthat is partly also the love of dominion, perhaps, and partly a personal\r\nlove for the beauty of trees and flowers and natural things. Through\r\nthat we come to a third factor, that craving--strongest, perhaps, in\r\nthose Low German peoples, who are now ascendant throughout the\r\nworld--for a little private _imperium_ such as a house or cottage \"in\r\nits own grounds\" affords; and from that we pass on to the intense desire\r\nso many women feel--and just the women, too, who will mother the\r\nfuture--their almost instinctive demand, indeed, for a household, a\r\nseparate sacred and distinctive household, built and ordered after their\r\nown hearts, such as in its fulness only the country-side permits. Add to\r\nthese things the healthfulness of the country for young children, and\r\nthe wholesome isolation that is possible from much that irritates,\r\nstimulates prematurely, and corrupts in crowded centres, and the chief\r\npositive centrifugal inducements are stated, inducements that no\r\nprogress of inventions, at any rate, can ever seriously weaken. What now\r\nare the centripetal forces against which these inducements contend?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there are a group of forces that will diminish in\r\nstrength. There is at present the greater convenience of \"shopping\"\r\nwithin a short radius of the centre of the great city, a very important\r\nconsideration indeed to many wives and mothers. All the inner and many\r\nof the outer suburbs of London obtain an enormous proportion of the\r\nordinary household goods from half a dozen huge furniture, grocery, and\r\ndrapery firms, each of which has been enabled by the dearness and\r\ninefficiency of the parcels distribution of the post-office and railways\r\nto elaborate a now very efficient private system of taking orders and\r\ndelivering goods. Collectively these great businesses have been able to\r\nestablish a sort of monopoly of suburban trade, to overwhelm the small\r\nsuburban general tradesman (a fate that was inevitable for him in some\r\nway or other), and--which is a positive world-wide misfortune--to\r\noverwhelm also many highly specialized shops and dealers of the central\r\ndistrict. Suburban people nowadays get their wine and their novels,\r\ntheir clothes and their amusements, their furniture and their food, from\r\nsome one vast indiscriminate shop or \"store\" full of respectable\r\nmediocre goods, as excellent a thing for housekeeping as it is\r\ndisastrous to taste and individuality.[18] But it is doubtful if the\r\ndelivery organization of these great stores is any more permanent than\r\nthe token coinage of the tradespeople of the last century. Just as it\r\nwas with that interesting development, so now it is with parcels\r\ndistribution: private enterprise supplies in a partial manner a public\r\nneed, and with the organization of a public parcels and goods delivery\r\non cheap and sane lines in the place of our present complex, stupid,\r\nconfusing, untrustworthy, and fantastically costly chaos of post-office,\r\nrailways, and carriers, it is quite conceivable that Messrs. Omnium will\r\ngive place again to specialized shops.\r\n\r\nIt must always be remembered how timid, tentative, and dear the postal\r\nand telephone services of even the most civilized countries still are,\r\nand how inexorably the needs of revenue, public profit, and convenience\r\nfight in these departments against the tradition of official leisure and\r\ndignity. There is no reason now, except that the thing is not yet\r\nproperly organized, why a telephone call from any point in such a small\r\ncountry as England to any other should cost much more than a postcard.\r\nThere is no reason now, save railway rivalries and retail\r\nideas--obstacles some able and active man is certain to sweep away\r\nsooner or later--why the post-office should not deliver parcels anywhere\r\nwithin a radius of a hundred miles in a few hours at a penny or less for\r\na pound and a little over,[19] put our newspapers in our letter-boxes\r\ndirect from the printing-office, and, in fact, hand in nearly every\r\nconstant need of the civilized household, except possibly butcher's\r\nmeat, coals, green-grocery, and drink. And since there is no reason, but\r\nquite removable obstacles, to prevent this development of the\r\npost-office, I imagine it will be doing all these things within the next\r\nhalf-century. When it is, this particular centripetal pull, at any rate,\r\nwill have altogether ceased to operate.\r\n\r\nA second important centripetal consideration at present is the\r\ndesirability of access to good schools and to the doctor. To leave the\r\ngreat centres is either to abandon one's children, or to buy air for\r\nthem at the cost of educational disadvantages. But access, be it noted,\r\nis another word for transit. It is doubtful if these two needs will so\r\nmuch keep people close to the great city centres as draw them together\r\nabout secondary centres. New centres they may be--compare Hindhead, for\r\nexample--in many cases; but also, it may be, in many cases the more\r\nhealthy and picturesque of the existing small towns will develop a new\r\nlife. Already, in the case of the London area, such once practically\r\nautonomous places as Guildford, Tunbridge Wells, and Godalming have\r\nbecome economically the centres of lax suburbs, and the same fate may\r\nvery probably overtake, for example, Shrewsbury, Stratford, and Exeter,\r\nand remoter and yet remoter townships. Indeed, for all that this\r\nparticular centripetal force can do, the confluent \"residential suburbs\"\r\nof London, of the great Lancashire-Yorkshire city, and of the Scotch\r\ncity, may quite conceivably replace the summer lodging-house\r\nwatering-places of to-day, and extend themselves right round the coast\r\nof Great Britain, before the end of the next century, and every open\r\nspace of mountain and heather be dotted--not too thickly--with clumps of\r\nprosperous houses about school, doctor, engineers, book and provision\r\nshops.\r\n\r\nA third centripetal force will not be set aside so easily. The direct\r\nantagonist it is to that love of nature that drives people out to moor\r\nand mountain. One may call it the love of the crowd; and closely allied\r\nto it is that love of the theatre which holds so many people in bondage\r\nto the Strand. Charles Lamb was the Richard Jefferies of this group of\r\ntendencies, and the current disposition to exaggerate the opposition\r\nforce, especially among English-speaking peoples, should not bind us to\r\nthe reality of their strength. Moreover, interweaving with these\r\ninfluences that draw people together are other more egotistical and\r\nintenser motives, ardent in youth and by no means--to judge by the\r\nFolkestone Leas--extinct in age, the love of dress, the love of the\r\ncrush, the hot passion for the promenade. Here, no doubt, what one may\r\nspeak of loosely as \"racial\" characteristics count for much. The common\r\nactor and actress of all nationalities, the Neapolitan, the modern\r\nRoman, the Parisian, the Hindoo, I am told, and that new and interesting\r\ntype, the rich and liberated Jew emerging from his Ghetto and free now\r\nabsolutely to show what stuff he is made of, flame out most gloriously\r\nin this direction. To a certain extent this group of tendencies may lead\r\nto the formation of new secondary centres within the \"available\" area,\r\ntheatrical and musical centres--centres of extreme Fashion and\r\nSelectness, centres of smartness and opulent display--but it is probable\r\nthat for the large number of people throughout the world who cannot\r\nafford to maintain households in duplicate these will be for many years\r\nyet strictly centripetal forces, and will keep them within the radius\r\nmarked by whatever will be the future equivalent in length of, say, the\r\npresent two-shilling cab ride in London.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, for all such \"shopping\" as one cannot do by telephone or\r\npostcard, it will still be natural for the shops to be gathered together\r\nin some central place. And \"shopping\" needs refreshment, and may\r\nculminate in relaxation. So that Bond Street and Regent Street, the\r\nBoulevard des Capuchins, the Corso, and Broadway will still be brilliant\r\nand crowded for many years for all the diffusion that is here\r\nforecast--all the more brilliant and crowded, perhaps, for the lack of a\r\nthronging horse traffic down their central ways. But the very fact that\r\nthe old nucleus is still to be the best place for all who trade in a\r\nconcourse of people, for novelty shops and art shops, and theatres and\r\nbusiness buildings, by keeping up the central ground values will operate\r\nagainst residence there and shift the \"masses\" outwardly.\r\n\r\nAnd once people have been driven into cab, train, or omnibus, the only\r\nreason why they should get out to a residence here rather than there is\r\nthe necessity of saving time, and such a violent upward gradient of\r\nfares as will quite outbalance the downward gradient of ground values.\r\nWe have, however, already forecast a swift, varied, and inevitably\r\ncompetitive suburban traffic. And so, though the centre will probably\r\nstill remain the centre and \"Town,\" it will be essentially a bazaar, a\r\ngreat gallery of shops and places of concourse and rendezvous, a\r\npedestrian place, its pathways reinforced by lifts and moving platforms,\r\nand shielded from the weather, and altogether a very spacious,\r\nbrilliant, and entertaining agglomeration.\r\n\r\nEnough now has been said to determine the general nature of the\r\nexpansion of the great cities in the future, so far as the more\r\nprosperous classes are concerned. It will not be a regular diffusion\r\nlike the diffusion of a gas, but a process of throwing out the \"homes,\"\r\nand of segregating various types of people. The omens seem to point\r\npretty unmistakably to a wide and quite unprecedented diversity in the\r\nvarious suburban townships and suburban districts. Of that aspect of\r\nthe matter a later paper must treat. It is evident that from the outset\r\nracial and national characteristics will tell in this diffusion. We are\r\ngetting near the end of the great Democratic, Wholesale, or Homogeneous\r\nphase in the world's history. The sport-loving Englishman, the sociable\r\nFrenchman, the vehement American will each diffuse his own great city in\r\nhis own way.\r\n\r\nAnd now, how will the increase in the facilities of communication we\r\nhave assumed affect the condition of those whose circumstances are more\r\nlargely dictated by economic forces? The mere diffusion of a large\r\nproportion of the prosperous and relatively free, and the multiplication\r\nof various types of road and mechanical traction, means, of course, that\r\nin this way alone a perceptible diffusion of the less independent\r\nclasses will occur. To the subsidiary centres will be drawn doctor and\r\nschoolmaster, and various dealers in fresh provisions, baker, grocer,\r\nbutcher; or if they are already established there they will flourish\r\nmore and more, and about them the convenient home of the future, with\r\nits numerous electrical and mechanical appliances, and the various\r\nbicycles, motor-cars, photographic and phonographic apparatus that will\r\nbe included in its equipment will gather a population of repairers,\r\n\"accessory\" dealers and working engineers, a growing class which from\r\nits necessary intelligence and numbers will play a very conspicuous part\r\nin the social development of the twentieth century. The much more\r\nelaborate post-office and telephone services will also bring intelligent\r\ningredients to these suburban nuclei, these restorations of the old\r\nvillages and country towns. And the sons of the cottager within the\r\naffected area will develop into the skilled vegetable or flower\r\ngardeners, the skilled ostler--with some veterinary science--and so\r\nforth, for whom also there will evidently be work and a living. And\r\ndotted at every convenient position along the new roads, availing\r\nthemselves no doubt whenever possible of the picturesque inns that the\r\nold coaching days have left us, will be wayside restaurants and tea\r\nhouses, and motor and cycle stores and repair places. So much diffusion\r\nis practically inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as we have already intimated, many Londoners in the future\r\nmay abandon the city office altogether, preferring to do their business\r\nin more agreeable surroundings. Such a business as book publishing, for\r\nexample, has no unbreakable bonds to keep it in the region of high rent\r\nand congested streets. The days when the financial fortunes of books\r\ndepended upon the colloquial support of influential people in a small\r\nSociety are past; neither publishers nor authors as a class have any\r\nrelation to Society at all, and actual access to newspaper offices is\r\nnecessary only to the ranker forms of literary imposture. That personal\r\nintercourse between publishers and the miscellaneous race of authors\r\nwhich once justified the central position has, I am told, long since\r\nceased. And the withdrawing publishers may very well take with them the\r\nprinters and binders, and attract about them their illustrators and\r\ndesigners.... So, as a typical instance, one--now urban--trade may\r\ndetach itself.\r\n\r\nPublishing is, however, only one of the many similar trades equally\r\nprofitable and equally likely to move outward to secondary centres, with\r\nthe development and cheapening of transit. It is all a question of\r\ntransit. Limitation of transit contracts the city, facilitation expands\r\nand disperses it. All this case for diffusion so far is built up\r\nentirely on the hypothesis we attempted to establish in the first paper,\r\nthat transit of persons and goods alike is to become easier, swifter,\r\nand altogether better organized than it is at present.\r\n\r\nThe telephone will almost certainly prove a very potent auxiliary indeed\r\nto the forces making for diffusion. At present that convenience is still\r\nneedlessly expensive in Great Britain, and a scandalously stupid\r\nbusiness conflict between telephone company and post-office delays,\r\ncomplicates, and makes costly and exasperating all trunk communications;\r\nbut even under these disadvantages the thing is becoming a factor in the\r\nlife of ordinary villadom. Consider all that lies within its\r\npossibilities. Take first the domestic and social side; almost all the\r\nlabour of ordinary shopping can be avoided--goods nowadays can be\r\nordered and sent either as sold outright, or on approval, to any place\r\nwithin a hundred miles of London, and in one day they can be examined,\r\ndiscussed, and returned--at any rate, in theory. The mistress of the\r\nhouse has all her local tradesmen, all the great London shops, the\r\ncirculating library, the theatre box-office, the post-office and\r\ncab-rank, the nurses' institute and the doctor, within reach of her\r\nhand. The instrument we may confidently expect to improve, but even now\r\nspeech is perfectly clear and distinct over several hundred miles of\r\nwire. Appointments and invitations can be made; and at a cost varying\r\nfrom a penny to two shillings any one within two hundred miles of home\r\nmay speak day or night into the ear of his or her household. Were it not\r\nfor that unmitigated public nuisance, the practical control of our\r\npost-office by non-dismissable Civil servants, appointed so young as to\r\nbe entirely ignorant of the unofficial world, it would be possible now\r\nto send urgent messages at any hour of the day or night to any part of\r\nthe world; and even our sacred institution of the Civil Service can\r\nscarcely prevent this desirable consummation for many years more. The\r\nbusiness man may then sit at home in his library and bargain, discuss,\r\npromise, hint, threaten, tell such lies as he dare not write, and, in\r\nfact, do everything that once demanded a personal encounter. Already for\r\na great number of businesses it is no longer necessary that the office\r\nshould be in London, and only habit, tradition, and minor considerations\r\nkeep it there. With the steady cheapening and the steady increase in\r\nefficiency of postal and telephonic facilities, and of goods transit, it\r\nseems only reasonable to anticipate the need for that expensive office\r\nand the irksome daily journey will steadily decline. In other words,\r\nwhat will still be economically the \"city,\" as distinguished from the\r\n\"agricultural\" population, will probably be free to extend, in the case\r\nof all the prosperous classes not tied to large establishments in need\r\nof personal supervision, far beyond the extreme limits of the daily hour\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nBut the diffusion of the prosperous, independent, and managing classes\r\ninvolves in itself a very considerable diffusion of the purely \"working\"\r\nclasses also. Their centres of occupation will be distributed, and their\r\nfreedom to live at some little distance from their work will be\r\nincreased. Whether this will mean dotting the country with dull, ugly\r\nlittle streets, slum villages like Buckfastleigh in Devon, for example,\r\nor whether it may result in entirely different and novel aspects, is a\r\npoint for which at present we are not ready. But it bears upon the\r\nquestion that ugliness and squalor upon the main road will appeal to the\r\nmore prosperous for remedy with far more vigour than when they are\r\nstowed compactly in a slum.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to demonstrate that old \"town\" and \"city\" will be,\r\nin truth, terms as obsolete as \"mail coach.\" For these new areas that\r\nwill grow out of them we want a term, and the administrative \"urban\r\ndistrict\" presents itself with a convenient air of suggestion. We may\r\nfor our present purposes call these coming town provinces \"urban\r\nregions.\" Practically, by a process of confluence, the whole of Great\r\nBritain south of the Highlands seems destined to become such an urban\r\nregion, laced all together not only by railway and telegraph, but by\r\nnovel roads such as we forecast in the former chapter, and by a dense\r\nnetwork of telephones, parcels delivery tubes, and the like nervous and\r\narterial connections.\r\n\r\nIt will certainly be a curious and varied region, far less monotonous\r\nthan our present English world, still in its thinner regions, at any\r\nrate, wooded, perhaps rather more abundantly wooded, breaking\r\ncontinually into park and garden, and with everywhere a scattering of\r\nhouses. These will not, as a rule, I should fancy, follow the fashion of\r\nthe vulgar ready-built villas of the existing suburb, because the\r\nfreedom people will be able to exercise in the choice of a site will rob\r\nthe \"building estate\" promoter of his local advantage; in many cases the\r\nhouses may very probably be personal homes, built for themselves as much\r\nas the Tudor manor-houses were, and even, in some cases, as æsthetically\r\nright. Each district, I am inclined to think, will develop its own\r\ndifferences of type and style. As one travels through the urban region,\r\none will traverse open, breezy, \"horsey\" suburbs, smart white gates and\r\npalings everywhere, good turf, a Grand Stand shining pleasantly;\r\ngardening districts all set with gables and roses, holly hedges, and\r\nemerald lawns; pleasant homes among heathery moorlands and golf links,\r\nand river districts with gaily painted boat-houses peeping from the\r\nosiers. Then presently a gathering of houses closer together, and a\r\npromenade and a whiff of band and dresses, and then, perhaps, a little\r\nisland of agriculture, hops, or strawberry gardens, fields of\r\ngrey-plumed artichokes, white-painted orchard, or brightly neat poultry\r\nfarm. Through the varied country the new wide roads will run, here\r\ncutting through a crest and there running like some colossal aqueduct\r\nacross a valley, swarming always with a multitudinous traffic of bright,\r\nswift (and not necessarily ugly) mechanisms; and everywhere amidst the\r\nfields and trees linking wires will stretch from pole to pole. Ever and\r\nagain there will appear a cluster of cottages--cottages into which we\r\nshall presently look more closely--about some works or workings, works,\r\nit may be, with the smoky chimney of to-day replaced by a gaily painted\r\nwindwheel or waterwheel to gather and store the force for the machinery;\r\nand ever and again will come a little town, with its cherished ancient\r\nchurch or cathedral, its school buildings and museums, its\r\nrailway-station, perhaps its fire-station, its inns and restaurants, and\r\nwith all the wires of the countryside converging to its offices. All\r\nthat is pleasant and fair of our present countryside may conceivably\r\nstill be there among the other things. There is no reason why the\r\nessential charm of the country should disappear; the new roads will not\r\nsupersede the present high roads, which will still be necessary for\r\nhorses and subsidiary traffic; and the lanes and hedges, the field paths\r\nand wild flowers, will still have their ample justification. A certain\r\nlack of solitude there may be perhaps, and--\r\n\r\nWill conspicuous advertisements play any part in the landscape?...\r\n\r\nBut I find my pen is running ahead, an imagination prone to realistic\r\nconstructions is struggling to paint a picture altogether prematurely.\r\nThere is very much to be weighed and decided before we can get from our\r\npresent generalization to the style of architecture these houses will\r\nshow, and to the power and nature of the public taste. We have laid down\r\nnow the broad lines of road, railway, and sea transit in the coming\r\ncentury, and we have got this general prophecy of \"urban regions\"\r\nestablished, and for the present that much must suffice.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the world beyond our urban regions? The same line of\r\nreasoning that leads to the expectation that the city will diffuse\r\nitself until it has taken up considerable areas and many of the\r\ncharacteristics, the greenness, the fresh air, of what is now country,\r\nleads us to suppose also that the country will take to itself many of\r\nthe qualities of the city. The old antithesis will indeed cease, the\r\nboundary lines will altogether disappear; it will become, indeed, merely\r\na question of more or less populous. There will be horticulture and\r\nagriculture going on within the \"urban regions,\" and \"urbanity\" without\r\nthem. Everywhere, indeed, over the land of the globe between the frozen\r\ncircles, the railway and the new roads will spread, the net-work of\r\ncommunication wires and safe and convenient ways. To receive the daily\r\npaper a few hours late, to wait a day or so for goods one has ordered,\r\nwill be the extreme measure of rusticity save in a few remote islands\r\nand inaccessible places. The character of the meshes in that wider\r\nnetwork of roads that will be the country, as distinguished from the\r\nurban district, will vary with the soil, the climate and the tenure of\r\nthe land--will vary, too, with the racial and national differences. But\r\nthroughout all that follows, this mere relativity of the new sort of\r\ntown to the new sort of country over which the new sorts of people we\r\nare immediately to consider will be scattered, must be borne in mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[At the risk of insistence, I must repeat that, so far, I have been\r\nstudiously taking no account of the fact that there is such a thing as a\r\nboundary line or a foreigner in the world. It will be far the best thing\r\nto continue to do this until we can get out all that will probably\r\nhappen universally or generally, and in particular the probable changes\r\nin social forces, social apparatus and internal political methods. We\r\nshall then come to the discussion of language, nationality and\r\ninternational conflicts, equipped with such an array of probabilities\r\nand possibilities as will enable us to guess at these special issues\r\nwith an appearance of far more precision than would be the case if we\r\nconsidered them now.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] It is true that many scholars estimate a high-water mark for the\r\nRoman population in excess of two millions; and one daring authority, by\r\nthrowing out suburbs _ad libitum_ into the Campagna, suburbs of which no\r\ntrace remains, has raised the two to ten. The Colosseum could, no doubt,\r\nseat over 80,000 spectators; the circuit of the bench frontage of the\r\nCircus Maximus was very nearly a mile in length, and the Romans of\r\nImperial times certainly used ten times as much water as the modern\r\nRomans. But, on the other hand, habits change, and Rome as it is defined\r\nby lines drawn at the times of its greatest ascendancy--the city, that\r\nis, enclosed by the walls of Aurelian and including all the regiones of\r\nAugustus, an enclosure from which there could have been no reason for\r\nexcluding half or more of its population--could have scarcely contained\r\na million. It would have packed very comfortably within the circle of\r\nthe Grands Boulevards of Paris--the Paris, that is, of Louis XIV., with\r\na population of 560,000; and the Rome of to-day, were the houses that\r\nspread so densely over the once vacant Campus Martius distributed in the\r\nnow deserted spaces in the south and east, and the Vatican suburb\r\nreplaced within the ancient walls, would quite fill the ancient limits,\r\nin spite of the fact that the population is under 500,000. But these are\r\nincidental doubts on a very authoritative opinion, and, whatever their\r\nvalue, they do not greatly affect the significance of these new great\r\ncities, which have arisen all over the world, as if by the operation of\r\na natural law, as the railways have developed.\r\n\r\n[14] It will be plain that such towns must have clearly defined limits\r\nof population, _dependant finally on the minimum yearly produce of the\r\ndistrict they control_. If ever they rise above that limit the natural\r\nchecks of famine, and of pestilence following enfeeblement, will come\r\ninto operation, and they will always be kept near this limit by the\r\nnatural tendency of humanity to increase. The limit would rise with\r\nincreasing public intelligence, and the organization of the towns would\r\nbecome more definite.\r\n\r\n[15] I owe the fertilizing suggestion of this general principle to a\r\npaper by Grant Allen that I read long ago in _Longman's Magazine_.\r\n\r\n[16] It is worth remarking that in 1801 the density of population in the\r\nCity of London was half as dense again as that of any district, even of\r\nthe densest \"slum\" districts, to-day.\r\n\r\n[17] Be it noted that the phrase \"available area\" is used, and various\r\nother modifying considerations altogether waived for the present.\r\n\r\n[18] Their temporary suppression of the specialist is indeed carried to\r\nsuch an extent that one may see even such things as bronze ornaments and\r\npersonal jewellery listed in Messrs. Omnium's list, and stored in list\r\ndesigns and pattern; and their assistants will inform you that their\r\nbrooch, No. 175, is now \"very much worn,\" without either blush or smile.\r\n\r\n[19] The present system of charging parcels by the pound, when goods are\r\nsold by the pound, and so getting a miserly profit in the packing, is\r\nsurely one of the absurdest disregards of the obvious it is possible to\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDEVELOPING SOCIAL ELEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mere differences in thickness of population and facility of movement\r\nthat have been discussed thus far, will involve consequences remarkable\r\nenough, upon the _facies_ of the social body; but there are certain\r\nstill broader features of the social order of the coming time, less\r\nintimately related to transit, that it will be convenient to discuss at\r\nthis stage. They are essentially outcomes of the enormous development of\r\nmechanism which has been the cardinal feature of the nineteenth century;\r\nfor this development, by altering the method and proportions of almost\r\nall human undertakings,[20] has altered absolutely the grouping and\r\ncharacter of the groups of human beings engaged upon them.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world for forty centuries the more highly developed\r\nsocieties have always presented under a considerable variety of\r\nsuperficial differences certain features in common. Always at the base\r\nof the edifice, supporting all, subordinate to all, and the most\r\nnecessary of all, there has been the working cultivator, peasant, serf,\r\nor slave. Save for a little water-power, a little use of windmills, the\r\ntraction of a horse or mule, this class has been the source of all the\r\nwork upon which the community depends. And, moreover, whatever labour\r\ntown developments have demanded has been supplied by the muscle of its\r\nfecund ranks. It has been, in fact--and to some extent still is--the\r\nmultitudinous living machinery of the old social order; it carried,\r\ncropped, tilled, built, and made. And, directing and sometimes owning\r\nthis human machinery, there has always been a superior class, bound\r\nusually by a point of honour not to toil, often warlike, often\r\nequestrian, and sometimes cultivated. In England this is the gentility,\r\nin most European countries it is organized as a nobility; it is\r\nrepresented in the history of India by the \"twice born\" castes, and in\r\nChina--the most philosophically conceived and the most stably organized\r\nsocial system the old order ever developed--it finds its equivalent in\r\nthe members of a variously buttoned mandarinate, who ride, not on\r\nhorses, but on a once adequate and still respectable erudition. These\r\ntwo primary classes may and do become in many cases complicated by\r\nsubdivisions; the peasant class may split into farmers and labourers,\r\nthe gentlemen admit a series of grades and orders, kings, dukes, earls,\r\nand the like, but the broad distinction remains intact, as though it\r\nwas a distinction residing in the nature of things.[21]\r\n\r\nFrom the very dawn of history until the first beginnings of mechanism in\r\nthe eighteenth century, this simple scheme of orders was the universal\r\norganization of all but savage humanity, and the chief substance of\r\nhistory until these later years has been in essence the perpetual\r\nendeavour of specific social systems of this type to attain in every\r\nregion the locally suitable permanent form, in face of those two\r\ninveterate enemies of human stability, innovation, and that secular\r\nincrease in population that security permits. The imperfection of the\r\nmeans of communication rendered political unions of a greater area than\r\nthat swept by a hundred-mile radius highly unstable. It was a world of\r\nsmall states. Lax empires came and went, at the utmost they were the\r\nlinking of practically autonomous states under a common _Pax_. Wars were\r\nusually wars between kingdoms, conflicts of this local experiment in\r\nsocial organization with that. Through all the historical period these\r\ntwo well-defined classes of gentle and simple acted and reacted upon\r\neach other, every individual in each class driven by that same will to\r\nlive and do, that imperative of self-establishment and aggression that\r\nis the spirit of this world. Until the coming of gunpowder, the man on\r\nhorseback--commonly with some sort of armour--was invincible in battle\r\nin the open. Wherever the land lay wide and unbroken, and the great\r\nlines of trade did not fall, there the horseman was master--or the\r\nclerkly man behind the horseman. Such a land was aristocratic and tended\r\nto form castes. The craftsman sheltered under a patron, and in guilds in\r\na walled town, and the labourer was a serf. He was ruled over by his\r\nknight or by his creditor--in the end it matters little how the\r\ngentleman began. But where the land became difficult by reason of\r\nmountain or forest, or where water greatly intersected it, the pikeman\r\nor closer-fighting swordsman or the bowman could hold his own, and a\r\ndemocratic flavour, a touch of repudiation, was in the air. In such\r\ncountries as Italy, Greece, the Alps, the Netherlands, and Great\r\nBritain, the two forces of the old order, the aristocrat and the common\r\nman, were in a state of unstable equilibrium through the whole period of\r\nhistory. A slight change[22] in the details of the conflict for\r\nexistence could tilt the balance. A weapon a little better adapted to\r\none class than the other, or a slight widening of the educational gap,\r\nworked out into historically imposing results, to dynastic changes,\r\nclass revolutions and the passing of empires.\r\n\r\nThroughout it was essentially one phase of human organization. When one\r\ncomes to examine the final result, it is astonishing to remark the small\r\namount of essential change, of positively final and irreparable\r\nalteration, in the conditions of the common life. Consider, for example,\r\nhow entirely in sympathy was the close of the eighteenth century with\r\nthe epoch of Horace, and how closely equivalent were the various social\r\naspects of the two periods. The literature of Rome was living reading in\r\na sense that has suddenly passed away, it fitted all occasions, it\r\nconflicted with no essential facts in life. It was a commonplace of the\r\nthought of that time that all things recurred, all things circled back\r\nto their former seasons; there was nothing new under the sun. But now\r\nalmost suddenly the circling has ceased, and we find ourselves breaking\r\naway. Correlated with the sudden development of mechanical forces that\r\nfirst began to be socially perceptible in the middle eighteenth century,\r\nhas been the appearance of great masses of population, having quite\r\nnovel functions and relations in the social body, and together with this\r\nappearance such a suppression, curtailment, and modification of the\r\nolder classes, as to point to an entire disintegration of that system.\r\nThe _facies_ of the social fabric has changed, and--as I hope to make\r\nclear--is still changing in a direction from which, without a total\r\ndestruction and rebirth of that fabric, there can never be any return.\r\n\r\nThe most striking of the new classes to emerge is certainly the\r\nshareholding class, the owners of a sort of property new in the world's\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nBefore the eighteenth century the only property of serious importance\r\nconsisted of land and buildings. These were \"real\" estate. Beyond these\r\nthings were live-stock, serfs, and the furnishings of real estate, the\r\nsurface aspect of real estate, so to speak, personal property, ships,\r\nweapons, and the Semitic invention of money. All such property had to be\r\nactually \"held\" and administered by the owner, he was immediately in\r\nconnection with it and responsible for it. He could leave it only\r\nprecariously to a steward and manager, and to convey the revenue of it\r\nto him at a distance was a difficult and costly proceeding. To prevent a\r\nconstant social disturbance by lapsing and dividing property, and in the\r\nabsence of any organized agency to receive lapsed property, inheritance\r\nand preferably primogeniture were of such manifest advantage that the\r\nold social organization always tended in the direction of these\r\ninstitutions. Such usury as was practised relied entirely on the land\r\nand the anticipated agricultural produce of the land.\r\n\r\nBut the usury and the sleeping partnerships of the Joint Stock Company\r\nsystem which took shape in the eighteenth and the earlier half of the\r\nnineteenth century opened quite unprecedented uses for money, and\r\ncreated a practically new sort of property and a new proprietor class.\r\nThe peculiar novelty of this property is easily defined. Given a\r\nsufficient sentiment of public honesty, share property is property that\r\ncan be owned at any distance and that yields its revenue without thought\r\nor care on the part of its proprietor; it is, indeed, absolutely\r\nirresponsible property, a thing that no old world property ever was.\r\nBut, in spite of its widely different nature, the laws of inheritance\r\nthat the social necessities of the old order of things established have\r\nbeen applied to this new species of possession without remark. It is\r\nindestructible, imperishable wealth, subject only to the mutations of\r\nvalue that economic changes bring about. Related in its character of\r\nabsolute irresponsibility to this shareholding class is a kindred class\r\nthat has grown with the growth of the great towns, the people who live\r\nupon ground rents. There is every indication that this element of\r\nirresponsible, independent, and wealthy people in the social body,\r\npeople who feel the urgency of no exertion, the pressure of no specific\r\npositive duties, is still on the increase, and may still for a long time\r\nincreasingly preponderate. It overshadows the responsible owner of real\r\nproperty or of real businesses altogether. And most of the old\r\naristocrats, the old knightly and landholding people, have, so to speak,\r\nconverted themselves into members of this new class.\r\n\r\nIt is a class with scarcely any specific characteristics beyond its\r\ndefining one, of the possession of property and all the potentialities\r\nproperty entails, with a total lack of function with regard to that\r\nproperty. It is not even collected into a distinct mass. It graduates\r\ninsensibly into every other class, it permeates society as threads and\r\nveins of gold permeate quartz. It includes the millionaire snob, the\r\npolitical-minded plutocrat, the wealthy sensualist, open-handed\r\nreligious fanatics, the \"Charitable,\" the smart, the magnificently dull,\r\nthe great army of timid creatures who tremble through life on a safe\r\nbare sufficiency,[23] travellers, hunters, minor poets, sporting\r\nenthusiasts, many of the officers in the British Army, and all sorts and\r\nconditions of amateurs. In a sense it includes several modern royalties,\r\nfor the crown in several modern constitutional states is a _corporation\r\nsole_, and the monarch the unique, unlimited, and so far as necessity\r\ngoes, quite functionless shareholder. He may be a heavy-eyed sensualist,\r\na small-minded leader of fashion, a rival to his servants in the gay\r\nscience of etiquette, a frequenter of race-courses and music-halls, a\r\nliterary or scientific quack, a devotee, an amateur anything--the point\r\nis that his income and sustenance have no relation whatever to his\r\nactivities. If he fancies it, or is urged to it by those who have\r\ninfluence over him, he may even \"be a king!\" But that is not compulsory,\r\nnot essential, and there are practically no conditional restrictions\r\nwhatever laid upon him.\r\n\r\nThose who belong to this shareholding class only partially, who\r\npartially depend upon dividends and partially upon activities, occur in\r\nevery rank and order of the whole social body. The waiter one tips\r\nprobably has a hundred or so in some remote company, the will of the\r\neminent labour reformer reveals an admirably distributed series of\r\ninvestments, the bishop sells tea and digs coal, or at any rate gets a\r\nprofit from some unknown persons tea-selling or coal-digging, to eke out\r\nthe direct recompense of his own modest corn-treading. Indeed, above the\r\nlabouring class, the number of individuals in the social body whose\r\ngross income is entirely the result of their social activities is very\r\nsmall. Previously in the world's history, saving a few quite exceptional\r\naspects, the possession and retention of property was conditional upon\r\nactivities of some sort, honest or dishonest, work, force, or fraud. But\r\nthe shareholding ingredient of our new society, so far as its\r\nshareholding goes, has no need of strength or wisdom; the countless\r\nuntraceable Owner of the modern world presents in a multitudinous form\r\nthe image of a Merovingian king. The shareholder owns the world _de\r\njure_, by the common recognition of the rights of property; and the\r\nincumbency of knowledge, management, and toil fall entirely to others.\r\nHe toils not, neither does he spin; he is mechanically released from the\r\npenalty of the Fall, he reaps in a still sinful world all the practical\r\nbenefits of a millennium--without any of its moral limitations.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to glance at certain considerations which point to the\r\nby no means self-evident proposition, that this factor of irresponsible\r\nproperty is certain to be present in the social body a hundred years\r\nahead. It has, no doubt, occurred to the reader that all the conditions\r\nof the shareholder's being unfit him for co-operative action in defence\r\nof the interests of his class. Since shareholders do nothing in common,\r\nexcept receive and hope for dividends, since they may be of any class,\r\nany culture, any disposition, or any level of capacity, since there is\r\nnothing to make them read the same papers, gather in the same places, or\r\nfeel any sort of sympathy with each other beyond the universal sympathy\r\nof man for man, they will, one may anticipate, be incapable of any\r\nconcerted action to defend the income they draw from society against any\r\nresolute attack. Such crude and obvious denials of the essential\r\nprinciples of their existence as the various Socialistic bodies have\r\nproclaimed have, no doubt, encountered a vast, unorganized, negative\r\nopposition from them, but the subtle and varied attack of natural forces\r\nthey have neither the collective intelligence to recognize, nor the\r\nnatural organization to resist. The shareholding body is altogether too\r\nchaotic and diffused for positive defence. And the question of the\r\nprolonged existence of this comparatively new social phenomenon, either\r\nin its present or some modified form, turns, therefore, entirely on the\r\nquasi-natural laws of the social body. If they favour it, it will\r\nsurvive; when they do not, it will vanish as the mists of the morning\r\nbefore the sun.\r\n\r\nNeglecting a few exceptional older corporations which, indeed, in their\r\nessence are not usurious, but of unlimited liability, the shareholding\r\nbody appeared first, in its present character, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and came to its full development in the mid-nineteenth. Was its\r\nappearance then due only to the attainment of a certain necessary degree\r\nof public credit, or was it correlated with any other force? It seems in\r\naccordance with facts to relate it to another force, the development of\r\nmechanism, so far as certain representative aspects go. Hitherto the\r\nonly borrower had been the farmer, then the exploring trader had found a\r\nworld too wide for purely individual effort, and then suddenly the\r\ncraftsmen of all sorts and the carriers discovered the need of the new,\r\ngreat, wholesale, initially expensive appliances that invention was\r\noffering them. It was the development of mechanism that created the\r\ngreat bulk of modern shareholding, it took its present shape\r\ndistinctively only with the appearance of the railways. The hitherto\r\nnecessary but subordinate craftsman and merchant classes were to have\r\nnew weapons, new powers, they were to develop to a new importance, to a\r\npreponderance even in the social body. But before they could attain\r\nthese weapons, before this new and novel wealth could be set up, it had\r\nto pay its footing in an apportioned world, it had to buy its right to\r\ndisturb the established social order. The dividend of the shareholder\r\nwas the tribute the new enterprise had to pay the old wealth. The share\r\nwas the manumission money of machinery. And essentially the shareholder\r\nrepresents and will continue to represent the responsible managing owner\r\nof a former state of affairs in process of supersession.\r\n\r\nIf the great material developments of the nineteenth century had been\r\nfinal, if they had, indeed, constituted merely a revolution and not an\r\nabsolute release from the fixed conditions about which human affairs\r\ncircled, we might even now be settling accounts with our Merovingians as\r\nthe socialists desire. But these developments were not final, and one\r\nsees no hint as yet of any coming finality. Invention runs free and our\r\nstate is under its dominion. The novel is continually struggling to\r\nestablish itself at the relative or absolute expense of the old. The\r\nstatesman's conception of social organization is no longer stability but\r\ngrowth. And so long as material progress continues, this tribute must\r\ncontinue to be paid; so long as the stream of development flows, this\r\nnecessary back eddy will endure. Even if we \"municipalize\" all sorts of\r\nundertakings we shall not alter the essential facts, we shall only\r\nsubstitute for the shareholder the corporation stockholder. The figure\r\nof an eddy is particularly appropriate. Enterprises will come and go,\r\nthe relative values of kinds of wealth will alter, old appliances, old\r\ncompanies, will serve their time and fall in value, individuals will\r\nwaste their substance, individual families and groups will die out,\r\ncertain portions of the share property of the world may be gathered, by\r\nelaborate manipulation, into a more or less limited number of hands,\r\nconceivably even families and groups will be taxed out by graduated\r\nlegacy duties and specially apportioned income taxes, but, for all such\r\npossible changes and modifications, the shareholding element will still\r\nendure, so long as our present progressive and experimental state of\r\nsociety obtains. And the very diversity, laxity, and weakness of the\r\ngeneral shareholding element, which will work to prevent its organizing\r\nitself in the interests of its property, or of evolving any distinctive\r\ntraditions or positive characters, will obviously prevent its\r\nobstructing the continual appearance of new enterprises, of new\r\nshareholders to replace the loss of its older constituents....\r\n\r\nAt the opposite pole of the social scale to that about which\r\nshareholding is most apparent, is a second necessary and quite\r\ninevitable consequence of the sudden transition that has occurred from a\r\nvery nearly static social organization to a violently progressive one.\r\nThis second consequence of progress is the appearance of a great number\r\nof people without either property or any evident function in the social\r\norganism. This new ingredient is most apparent in the towns, it is\r\nfrequently spoken of as the Urban Poor, but its characteristic traits\r\nare to be found also in the rural districts. For the most part its\r\nindividuals are either criminal, immoral, parasitic in more or less\r\nirregular ways upon the more successful classes, or labouring, at\r\nsomething less than a regular bare subsistence wage, in a finally\r\nhopeless competition against machinery that is as yet not so cheap as\r\ntheir toil. It is, to borrow a popular phrase, the \"submerged\" portion\r\nof the social body, a leaderless, aimless multitude, a multitude of\r\npeople drifting down towards the abyss. Essentially it consists of\r\npeople who have failed to \"catch on\" to the altered necessities the\r\ndevelopment of mechanism has brought about, they are people thrown out\r\nof employment by machinery, thrown out of employment by the escape of\r\nindustries along some newly opened line of communication to some remote\r\npart of the world, or born under circumstances that give them no\r\nopportunity of entering the world of active work. Into this welter of\r\nmachine-superseded toil there topples the non-adaptable residue of every\r\nchanging trade; its members marry and are given in marriage, and it is\r\nrecruited by the spendthrifts, weaklings, and failures of every superior\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nSince this class was not apparent in masses in the relatively static,\r\nrelatively less eliminatory, society of former times, its appearance has\r\ngiven rise to a belief that the least desirable section of the community\r\nhas become unprecedentedly prolific, that there is now going on a \"Rapid\r\nMultiplication of the Unfit.\" But sooner or later, as every East End\r\ndoctor knows, the ways of the social abyss lead to death, the premature\r\ndeath of the individual, or death through the death or infertility of\r\nthe individual's stunted offspring, or death through that extinction\r\nwhich moral perversion involves. It is a recruited class, not a breeding\r\nmultitude. Whatever expedients may be resorted to, to mitigate or\r\nconceal the essential nature of this social element, it remains in its\r\nessence wherever social progress is being made, the contingent of death.\r\nHumanity has set out in the direction of a more complex and exacting\r\norganization, and until, by a foresight to me at least inconceivable, it\r\ncan prevent the birth of just all the inadaptable, useless, or merely\r\nunnecessary creatures in each generation, there must needs continue to\r\nbe, in greater or less amount, this individually futile struggle beneath\r\nthe feet of the race; somewhere and in some form there must still\r\npersist those essentials that now take shape as the slum, the prison,\r\nand the asylum. All over the world, as the railway network has spread,\r\nin Chicago and New York as vividly as in London or Paris, the\r\ncommencement of the new movement has been marked at once by the\r\nappearance of this bulky irremovable excretion, the appearance of these\r\ngall stones of vicious, helpless, and pauper masses. There seems every\r\nreason to suppose that this phenomenon of unemployed citizens, who are,\r\nin fact, unemployable, will remain present as a class, perishing\r\nindividually and individually renewed, so long as civilization remains\r\nprogressive and experimental upon its present lines. Their drowning\r\nexistences may be utilized, the crude hardship of their lot may be\r\nconcealed or mitigated,[24] they may react upon the social fabric that\r\nis attempting to eliminate them, in very astounding ways, but their\r\npresence and their individual doom, it seems to me, will be\r\nunavoidable--at any rate, for many generations of men. They are an\r\nintegral part of this physiological process of mechanical progress, as\r\ninevitable in the social body as are waste matters and disintegrating\r\ncells in the body of an active and healthy man.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of these two strange functionless elements, although the\r\nmost striking symptom of the new phase of progressive mechanical\r\ncivilization now beginning, is by no means the most essential change in\r\nprogress. These appearances involve also certain disappearances. I have\r\nalready indicated pretty clearly that the vast irregular development of\r\nirresponsible wealthy people is swallowing up and assimilating more and\r\nmore the old class of administrative land-owning gentlemen in all their\r\ngrades and degrees. The old upper class, as a functional member of the\r\nState, is being effaced. And I have also suggested that the old lower\r\nclass, the broad necessary base of the social pyramid, the uneducated\r\ninadaptable peasants and labourers, is, with the development of\r\ntoil-saving machinery, dwindling and crumbling down bit by bit towards\r\nthe abyss. But side by side with these two processes is a third process\r\nof still profounder significance, and that is the reconstruction and the\r\nvast proliferation of what constituted the middle class of the old\r\norder. It is now, indeed, no longer a middle class at all. Rather all\r\nthe definite classes in the old scheme of functional precedence have\r\nmelted and mingled,[25] and in the molten mass there has appeared a vast\r\nintricate confusion of different sorts of people, some sailing about\r\nupon floating masses of irresponsible property, some buoyed by smaller\r\nfragments, some clinging desperately enough to insignificant atoms, a\r\ngreat and varied multitude swimming successfully without aid, or with an\r\namount of aid that is negligible in relation to their own efforts, and\r\nan equally varied multitude of less capable ones clinging to the\r\nswimmers, clinging to the floating rich, or clutching empty-handed and\r\nthrust and sinking down. This is the typical aspect of the modern\r\ncommunity. It will serve as a general description of either the United\r\nStates or any western European State, and the day is not far distant\r\nwhen the extension of means of communication, and of the shareholding\r\nmethod of conducting affairs, will make it applicable to the whole\r\nworld. Save, possibly, in a few islands and inaccessible places and\r\nregardless of colour or creed, this process of deliquescence seems\r\ndestined to spread. In a great diversity of tongues, in the phases of a\r\nnumber of conflicting moral and theological traditions, in the varying\r\ntones of contrasting racial temperaments, the grandchildren of black and\r\nwhite, and red and brown, will be seeking more or less consciously to\r\nexpress themselves in relation to these new and unusual social\r\nconditions. But the change itself is no longer amenable to their\r\ninterpretations, the world-wide spreading of swift communication, the\r\nobliteration of town and country, the deliquescence of the local social\r\norder, have an air of being processes as uncontrollable by such\r\ncollective intelligence as men can at present command, and as\r\nindifferent to his local peculiarities and prejudices as the movements\r\nof winds and tides....\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious that the interest of this speculation, at any rate,\r\ncentres upon this great intermediate mass of people who are neither\r\npassively wealthy, the sleeping partners of change, nor helplessly\r\nthrust out of the process. Indeed, from our point of view--an inquiry\r\ninto coming things--these non-effective masses would have but the\r\nslightest interest were it not for their enormous possibilities of\r\nreaction upon the really living portion of the social organism. This\r\nreally living portion seems at first sight to be as deliquescent in its\r\nnature, to be drifting down to as chaotic a structure as either the\r\nnon-functional owners that float above it or the unemployed who sink\r\nbelow. What were once the definite subdivisions of the middle class\r\nmodify and lose their boundaries. The retail tradesman of the towns, for\r\nexample--once a fairly homogeneous class throughout Europe--expands here\r\ninto vast store companies, and dwindles there to be an agent or\r\ncollector, seeks employment or topples outright into the abyss. But\r\nunder a certain scrutiny one can detect here what we do not detect in\r\nour other two elements, and that is that, going on side by side with the\r\nprocesses of dissolution and frequently masked by these, there are other\r\nprocesses by which men, often of the most diverse parentage and\r\nantecedent traditions, are being segregated into a multitude of\r\nspecific new groups which may presently develop very distinctive\r\ncharacters and ideals.\r\n\r\nThere are, for example, the unorganized myriads that one can cover by\r\nthe phrase \"mechanics and engineers,\" if one uses it in its widest\r\npossible sense. At present it would be almost impossible to describe\r\nsuch a thing as a typical engineer, to predicate any universally\r\napplicable characteristic of the engineer and mechanic. The black-faced,\r\noily man one figures emerging from the engine-room serves well enough,\r\nuntil one recalls the sanitary engineer with his additions of crockery\r\nand plumbing, the electrical engineer with his little tests and wires,\r\nthe mining engineer, the railway maker, the motor builder, and the\r\nirrigation expert. Even if we take some specific branch of all this huge\r\nmass of new employment the coming of mechanism has brought with it, we\r\nstill find an undigested miscellany. Consider the rude levy that is\r\nengaged in supplying and repairing the world's new need of bicycles!\r\nWheelwrights, watchmakers, blacksmiths, music-dealers, drapers,\r\nsewing-machine repairers, smart errand boys, ironmongers, individuals\r\nfrom all the older aspects of engineering, have been caught up by the\r\nnew development, are all now, with a more or less inadequate knowledge\r\nand training, working in the new service. But is it likely that this\r\nwill remain a rude levy? From all these varied people the world requires\r\ncertain things, and a failure to obtain them involves, sooner or later,\r\nin this competitive creation, an individual replacement and a push\r\ntowards the abyss. The very lowest of them must understand the machine\r\nthey contribute to make and repair, and not only is it a fairly complex\r\nmachine in itself, but it is found in several types and patterns, and so\r\nfar it has altered, and promises still to alter, steadily, by\r\nimprovements in this part and that. No limited stock-in-trade of\r\nknowledge, such as suffices for a joiner or an ostler, will serve. They\r\nmust keep on mastering new points, new aspects, they must be intelligent\r\nand adaptable, they must get a grasp of that permanent something that\r\nlies behind the changing immediate practice. In other words, they will\r\nhave to be educated rather than trained after the fashion of the old\r\ncraftsman. Just now this body of irregulars is threatened by the coming\r\nof the motors. The motors promise new difficulties, new rewards, and new\r\ncompetition. It is an ill look-out for the cycle mechanic who is not\r\nprepared to tackle the new problems that will arise. For all this next\r\ncentury this particular body of mechanics will be picking up new\r\nrecruits and eliminating the incompetent and the rule-of-thumb sage. Can\r\nit fail, as the years pass, to develop certain general characters, to\r\nbecome so far homogeneous as to be generally conscious of the need of a\r\nscientific education, at any rate in mechanical and chemical matters,\r\nand to possess, down to its very lowest ranks and orders, a common fund\r\nof intellectual training?\r\n\r\nBut the makers and repairers of cycles, and that larger multitude that\r\nwill presently be concerned with motors, are, after all, only a small\r\nand specialized section of the general body of mechanics and engineers.\r\nEvery year, with the advance of invention, new branches of activity,\r\nthat change in their nature and methods all too rapidly for the\r\nestablishment of rote and routine workers of the old type, call together\r\nfresh levies of amateurish workers and learners who must surely\r\npresently develop into, or give place to, bodies of qualified and\r\ncapable men. And the point I would particularly insist upon here is,\r\nthat throughout all its ranks and ramifications, from the organizing\r\nheads of great undertakings down to the assistant in the local repair\r\nshop, this new, great, and expanding body of mechanics and engineers\r\nwill tend to become an educated and adaptable class in a sense that the\r\ncraftsmen of former times were not educated and adaptable. Just how high\r\nthe scientific and practical education may rise in the central levels of\r\nthis body is a matter for subsequent speculation, just how much\r\ninitiative will be found in the lowest ranks depends upon many very\r\ncomplex considerations. But that here we have at least the possibility,\r\nthe primary creative conditions of a new, numerous, intelligent,\r\neducated, and capable social element is, I think, a proposition with\r\nwhich the reader will agree.\r\n\r\nWhat are the chief obstacles in the way of the emergence, from out the\r\npresent chaos, of this social element equipped, organized, educated,\r\nconscious of itself and of distinctive aims, in the next hundred years?\r\nIn the first place there is the spirit of trade unionism, the\r\nconservative contagion of the old craftsmanship. Trade Unions arose\r\nunder the tradition of the old order, when in every business, employer\r\nand employed stood in marked antagonism, stood as a special instance of\r\nthe universal relationship of gentle or intelligent, who supplied no\r\nlabour, and simple, who supplied nothing else. The interest of the\r\nemployer was to get as much labour as possible out of his hirelings; the\r\ncomplementary object in life of the hireling, whose sole function was\r\ndrudgery, who had no other prospect until death, was to give as little\r\nto his employer as possible. In order to keep the necessary labourer\r\nsubmissive, it was a matter of public policy to keep him uneducated and\r\nas near the condition of a beast of burden as possible, and in order to\r\nkeep his life tolerable against that natural increase which all the\r\nmoral institutions of his state promoted, the labourer--stimulated if\r\nhis efforts slackened by the touch of absolute misery--was forced to\r\ndevise elaborate rules for restricting the hours of toil, making its\r\nperformance needlessly complex, and shirking with extreme ingenuity and\r\nconscientiousness. In the older trades, of which the building trade is\r\nforemost, these two traditions, reinforced by unimaginative building\r\nregulations, have practically arrested any advance whatever.[26] There\r\ncan be no doubt that this influence has spread into what are practically\r\nnew branches of work. Even where new conveniences have called for new\r\ntypes of workmen and have opened the way for the elevation of a group of\r\nlabourers to the higher level of versatile educated men,[27] the old\r\ntraditions have to a very large extent prevailed. The average sanitary\r\nplumber of to-day in England insists upon his position as a mere\r\nlabourer as though it were some precious thing, he guards himself from\r\nimprovement as a virtuous woman guards her honour, he works for\r\nspecifically limited hours and by the hour with specific limitations in\r\nthe practice of his trade, on the fairly sound assumption that but for\r\nthat restriction any fool might do plumbing as well as he; whatever he\r\nlearns he learns from some other plumber during his apprenticeship\r\nyears--after which he devotes himself to doing the minimum of work in\r\nthe maximum of time until his brief excursion into this mysterious\r\nuniverse is over. So far from invention spurring him onward, every\r\nimprovement in sanitary work in England, at least, is limited by the\r\nproblem whether \"the men\" will understand it. A person ingenious enough\r\nto exceed this sacred limit might as well hang himself as trouble about\r\nthe improvement of plumbing.\r\n\r\nIf England stood alone, I do not see why each of the new mechanical and\r\nengineering industries, so soon as it develops sufficiently to have\r\ngathered together a body of workers capable of supporting a Trade Union\r\nsecretary, should not begin to stagnate in the same manner. Only England\r\ndoes not stand alone, and the building trade is so far not typical,\r\ninasmuch as it possesses a national monopoly that the most elaborate\r\nsystem of protection cannot secure any other group of trades. One must\r\nhave one's house built where one has to live, the importation of workmen\r\nin small bodies is difficult and dear, and if one cannot have the house\r\none wishes, one must needs have the least offensive substitute; but\r\nbicycle and motor, iron-work and furniture, engines, rails, and ships\r\none can import. The community, therefore, that does least to educate\r\nits mechanics and engineers out of the base and servile tradition of the\r\nold idea of industry will in the coming years of progress simply get a\r\ndisproportionate share of the rejected element, the trade will go\r\nelsewhere, and the community will be left in possession of an\r\nexceptionally large contingent for the abyss.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, I am dealing not with the specific community, but\r\nwith the generalized civilized community of A.D. 2000--we disregard the\r\nfate of states and empires for a time--and, for that emergent community,\r\nwherever it may be, it seems reasonable to anticipate, replacing and\r\nenormously larger and more important than the classes of common workmen\r\nand mechanics of to-day, a large fairly homogeneous body--big men and\r\nlittle men, indeed, but with no dividing lines--of more or less expert\r\nmechanics and engineers, with a certain common minimum of education and\r\nintelligence, and probably a common-class consciousness--a new body, a\r\nnew force, in the world's history.\r\n\r\nFor this body to exist implies the existence of much more than the\r\nprimary and initiating nucleus of engineers and skilled mechanics. If it\r\nis an educated class, its existence implies a class of educators, and\r\njust as far as it does get educated the schoolmasters will be skilled\r\nand educated men. The shabby-genteel middle-class schoolmaster of the\r\nEngland of to-day, in--or a little way out of--orders, with his\r\nsmattering of Greek, his Latin that leads nowhere, his fatuous\r\nmathematics, his gross ignorance of pedagogics, and his incomparable\r\nsnobbishness, certainly does not represent the schoolmaster of this\r\ncoming class. Moreover, the new element will necessarily embody its\r\ncollective, necessarily distinctive, and unprecedented thoughts in a\r\nliterature of its own, its development means the development of a new\r\nsort of writer and of new elements in the press. And since, if it does\r\nemerge, a revolution in the common schools of the community will be a\r\nnecessary part of the process, then its emergence will involve a\r\nrevolutionary change in the condition of classes that might otherwise\r\nremain as they are now--the older craftsman, for example.\r\n\r\nThe process of attraction will not end even there; the development of\r\nmore and more scientific engineering and of really adaptable operatives\r\nwill render possible agricultural contrivances that are now only dreams,\r\nand the diffusion of this new class over the country side--assuming the\r\nreasoning in my second chapter to be sound--will bring the lever of the\r\nimproved schools under the agriculturist. The practically autonomous\r\nfarm of the old epoch will probably be replaced by a great variety of\r\ntypes of cultivation, each with its labour-saving equipment. In this, as\r\nin most things, the future spells variation. The practical abolition of\r\nimpossible distances over the world will tend to make every district\r\nspecialize in the production for which it is best fitted, and to\r\ndevelop that production with an elaborate precision and economy. The\r\nchief opposing force to this tendency will be found in those countries\r\nwhere the tenure of the land is in small holdings. A population of small\r\nagriculturists that has really got itself well established is probably\r\nas hopelessly immovable a thing as the forces of progressive change will\r\nhave to encounter. The Arcadian healthiness and simplicity of the small\r\nholder, and the usefulness of little hands about him, naturally results\r\nin his keeping the population on his plot up to the limit of bare\r\nsubsistence. He avoids over-education, and his beasts live with him and\r\nhis children in a natural kindly manner. He will have no idlers, and\r\neven grand-mamma goes weeding. His nett produce is less than the\r\nproduction of the larger methods, but his gross is greater, and usually\r\nit is mortgaged more or less. Along the selvage of many of the new roads\r\nwe have foretold, his hens will peck and his children beg, far into the\r\ncoming decades. This simple, virtuous, open-air life is to be found\r\nripening in the north of France and Belgium, it culminated in Ireland in\r\nthe famine years, it has held its own in China--with a use of female\r\ninfanticide--for immemorable ages, and a number of excellent persons are\r\nendeavouring to establish it in England at the present time. At the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, under British rule, Kaffirs are being settled upon little\r\ninalienable holdings that must inevitably develop in the same\r\ndirection, and over the Southern States the nigger squats and\r\nmultiplies. It is fairly certain that these stagnant ponds of\r\npopulation, which will grow until public intelligence rises to the pitch\r\nof draining them, will on a greater scale parallel in the twentieth\r\ncentury the soon-to-be-dispersed urban slums of the nineteenth. But I do\r\nnot see how they can obstruct, more than locally, the reorganization of\r\nagriculture and horticulture upon the ampler and more economical lines\r\nmechanism permits, or prevent the development of a type of agriculturist\r\nas adaptable, alert, intelligent, unprejudiced, and modest as the coming\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nAnother great section of the community, the military element, will also\r\nfall within the attraction of this possible synthesis, and will\r\ninevitably undergo profound modification. Of the probable development of\r\nwarfare a later chapter shall treat, and here it will suffice to point\r\nout that at present science stands proffering the soldier vague, vast\r\npossibilities of mechanism, and, so far, he has accepted practically\r\nnothing but rifles which he cannot sight and guns that he does not learn\r\nto move about. It is quite possible the sailor would be in the like\r\ncase, but for the exceptional conditions that begot ironclads in the\r\nAmerican Civil War. Science offers the soldier transport that he does\r\nnot use, maps he does not use, entrenching devices, road-making devices,\r\nballoons and flying scouts, portable foods, security from disease, a\r\nthousand ways of organizing the horrible uncertainties of war. But the\r\nsoldier of to-day--I do not mean the British soldier only--still insists\r\non regarding these revolutionary appliances as mere accessories, and\r\nuntrustworthy ones at that, to the time-honoured practice of his art. He\r\nguards his technical innocence like a plumber.\r\n\r\nEvery European army is organized on the lines of the once fundamental\r\ndistinction of the horse and foot epoch, in deference to the contrast of\r\ngentle and simple. There is the officer, with all the traditions of old\r\nnobility, and the men still, by a hundred implications, mere sources of\r\nmechanical force, and fundamentally base. The British Army, for example,\r\nstill cherishes the tradition that its privates are absolutely\r\nilliterate, and such small instruction as is given them in the art of\r\nwar is imparted by bawling and enforced by abuse upon public drill\r\ngrounds. Almost all discussion of military matters still turns upon the\r\nnow quite stupid assumption that there are two primary military arms and\r\nno more, horse and foot. \"Cyclists are infantry,\" the War Office manual\r\nof 1900 gallantly declares in the face of this changing universe. After\r\nfifty years of railways, there still does not exist, in a world which is\r\nsaid to be over devoted to military affairs, a skilled and organized\r\nbody of men, specially prepared to seize, repair, reconstruct, work, and\r\nfight such an important element in the new social machinery as a\r\nrailway system. Such a business, in the next European war, will be\r\nhastily entrusted to some haphazard incapables drafted from one or other\r\nof the two prehistoric arms.... I do not see how this condition of\r\naffairs can be anything but transitory. There may be several wars\r\nbetween European powers, prepared and organized to accept the old\r\nconventions, bloody, vast, distressful encounters that may still leave\r\nthe art of war essentially unmodified, but sooner or later--it may be in\r\nthe improvised struggle that follows the collapse of some one of these\r\nhuge, witless, fighting forces--the new sort of soldier will emerge, a\r\nsober, considerate, engineering man--no more of a gentleman than the man\r\nsubordinated to him or any other self-respecting person....\r\n\r\nCertain interesting side questions I may glance at here, only for the\r\npresent, at least, to set them aside unanswered, the reaction, for\r\nexample, of this probable development of a great mass of educated and\r\nintelligent efficients upon the status and quality of the medical\r\nprofession, and the influence of its novel needs in either modifying the\r\nexisting legal body or calling into being a parallel body of more expert\r\nand versatile guides and assistants in business operations. But from the\r\nmention of this latter section one comes to another possible centre of\r\naggregation in the social welter. Opposed in many of their most\r\nessential conditions to the capable men who are of primary importance in\r\nthe social body, is the great and growing variety of non-productive but\r\nactive men who are engaged in more or less necessary operations of\r\norganization, promotion, advertisement, and trade. There are the\r\nbusiness managers, public and private, the political organizers,\r\nbrokers, commission agents, the varying grades of financier down to the\r\nmere greedy camp followers of finance, the gamblers pure and simple, and\r\nthe great body of their dependent clerks, typewriters, and assistants.\r\nAll this multitude will have this much in common, that it will be\r\ndealing, not with the primary inexorable logic of natural laws, but with\r\nthe shifting, uncertain prejudices and emotions of the general mass of\r\npeople. It will be wary and cunning rather than deliberate and\r\nintelligent, smart rather than prompt, considering always the appearance\r\nand effect before the reality and possibilities of things. It will\r\nprobably tend to form a culture about the political and financial\r\noperator as its ideal and central type, opposed to, and conflicting\r\nwith, the forces of attraction that will tend to group the new social\r\nmasses about the scientific engineer.[28]...\r\n\r\nHere, then (in the vision of the present writer), are the main social\r\nelements of the coming time: (i.) the element of irresponsible\r\nproperty; (ii.) the helpless superseded poor, that broad base of mere\r\ntoilers now no longer essential; (iii.) a great inchoate mass of more or\r\nless capable people engaged more or less consciously in applying the\r\ngrowing body of scientific knowledge to the general needs, a great mass\r\nthat will inevitably tend to organize itself in a system of\r\ninterdependent educated classes with a common consciousness and aim, but\r\nwhich may or may not succeed in doing so; and (iv.) a possibly equally\r\ngreat number of non-productive persons living in and by the social\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nAll these elements will be mingled confusedly together, passing into one\r\nanother by insensible gradations, scattered over the great urban regions\r\nand intervening areas our previous anticipations have sketched out.\r\nMoreover, they are developing, as it were unconsciously, under the\r\nstimulus of mechanical developments, and with the bandages of old\r\ntradition hampering their movements. The laws they obey, the governments\r\nthey live under, are for the most part laws made and governments planned\r\nbefore the coming of steam. The areas of administration are still areas\r\nmarked out by conditions of locomotion as obsolete as the quadrupedal\r\nmethod of the pre-arboreal ancestor. In Great Britain, for example, the\r\npolitical constitution, the balance of estates and the balance of\r\nparties, preserves the compromise of long-vanished antagonisms. The\r\nHouse of Lords is a collection of obsolete territorial dignitaries\r\nfitfully reinforced by the bishops and a miscellany (in no sense\r\nrepresentative) of opulent moderns; the House of Commons is the seat of\r\na party conflict, a faction fight of initiated persons, that has long\r\nceased to bear any real relation to current social processes. The\r\nmembers of the lower chamber are selected by obscure party machines\r\noperating upon constituencies almost all of which have long since become\r\ntoo vast and heterogeneous to possess any collective intelligence or\r\npurpose at all. In theory the House of Commons guards the interests of\r\nclasses that are, in fact, rapidly disintegrating into a number of quite\r\nantagonistic and conflicting elements. The new mass of capable men, of\r\nwhich the engineers are typical, these capable men who must necessarily\r\nbe the active principle of the new mechanically equipped social body,\r\nfinds no representation save by accident in either assembly. The man who\r\nhas concerned himself with the public health, with army organization,\r\nwith educational improvement, or with the vital matters of transport and\r\ncommunication, if he enter the official councils of the kingdom at all,\r\nmust enter ostensibly as the guardian of the interests of the free and\r\nindependent electors of a specific district that has long ceased to have\r\nany sort of specific interests at all.[29]...\r\n\r\nAnd the same obsolescence that is so conspicuous in the general\r\ninstitutions of the official kingdom of England, and that even English\r\npeople can remark in the official empire of China, is to be traced in a\r\ngreater or lesser degree in the nominal organization and public\r\ntradition throughout the whole world. The United States, for example,\r\nthe social mass which has perhaps advanced furthest along the new lines,\r\nstruggles in the iron bonds of a constitution that is based primarily on\r\na conception of a number of comparatively small, internally homogeneous,\r\nagricultural states, a bunch of pre-Johannesburg Transvaals,\r\ncommunicating little, and each constituting a separate autonomous\r\ndemocracy of free farmers--slaveholding or slaveless. Every country in\r\nthe world, indeed, that is organized at all, has been organized with a\r\nview to stability within territorial limits; no country has been\r\norganized with any foresight of development and inevitable change, or\r\nwith the slightest reference to the practical revolution in topography\r\nthat the new means of transit involve. And since this is so, and since\r\nhumanity is most assuredly embarked upon a series of changes of which we\r\nknow as yet only the opening phases, a large part of the history of the\r\ncoming years will certainly record more or less conscious endeavours to\r\nadapt these obsolete and obsolescent contrivances for the management of\r\npublic affairs to the new and continually expanding and changing\r\nrequirements of the social body, to correct or overcome the traditions\r\nthat were once wisdom and which are now obstruction, and to burst the\r\nstraining boundaries that were sufficient for the ancient states. There\r\nare here no signs of a millennium. Internal reconstruction, while men\r\nare still limited, egotistical, passionate, ignorant, and ignorantly\r\nled, means seditions and revolutions, and the rectification of frontiers\r\nmeans wars. But before we go on to these conflicts and wars certain\r\ngeneral social reactions must be considered.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] Even the characteristic conditions of writing books, that least\r\nmechanical of pursuits, have been profoundly affected by the typewriter.\r\n\r\n[21] To these two primary classes the more complicated societies have\r\nadded others. There is the priest, almost always in the social order of\r\nthe pre-railway period, an integral part, a functional organ of the\r\nsocial body, and there are the lawyer and the physician. And in the\r\ntowns--constituting, indeed, the towns--there appear, as an outgrowth of\r\nthe toiling class, a little emancipated from the gentleman's direct\r\ncontrol, the craftsman, the merchant, and the trading sailor,\r\nessentially accessory classes, producers of, and dealers in, the\r\naccessories of life, and mitigating and clouding only very slightly that\r\nbroad duality.\r\n\r\n[22] Slight, that is, in comparison with nineteenth-century changes.\r\n\r\n[23] It included, one remembers, Schopenhauer, but, as he remarked upon\r\noccasion, not Hegel.\r\n\r\n[24] A very important factor in this mitigation, a factor over which the\r\nhumanely minded cannot too greatly rejoice, will be the philanthropic\r\namusements of the irresponsible wealthy. There is a growing class of\r\nenergetic people--organizers, secretaries, preachers--who cater to the\r\nphilanthropic instinct, and who are, for all practical purposes,\r\nemploying a large and increasing section of suitable helpless people, in\r\nsupplying to their customers, by means of religious acquiescence and\r\nlight moral reforms, that sense of well-doing which is one of the least\r\nobjectionable of the functionless pleasures of life. The attempts to\r\nreinstate these failures by means of subsidized industries will, in the\r\nend, of course, merely serve to throw out of employment other just\r\nsubsisting strugglers; it will probably make little or no difference in\r\nthe nett result of the process.\r\n\r\n[25] I reserve any consideration of the special case of the \"priest.\"\r\n\r\n[26] I find it incredible that there will not be a sweeping revolution\r\nin the methods of building during the next century. The erection of a\r\nhouse-wall, come to think of it, is an astonishingly tedious and complex\r\nbusiness; the final result exceedingly unsatisfactory. It has been my\r\nlot recently to follow in detail the process of building a private\r\ndwelling-house, and the solemn succession of deliberate, respectable,\r\nperfectly satisfied men, who have contributed each so many days of his\r\nlife to this accumulation of weak compromises, has enormously\r\nintensified my constitutional amazement at my fellow-creatures. The\r\nchief ingredient in this particular house-wall is the common brick,\r\nburnt earth, and but one step from the handfuls of clay of the ancestral\r\nmud hut, small in size and permeable to damp. Slowly, day by day, the\r\nwalls grew tediously up, to a melody of tinkling trowels. These bricks\r\nare joined by mortar, which is mixed in small quantities, and must vary\r\nvery greatly in its quality and properties throughout the house. In\r\norder to prevent the obvious evils of a wall of porous and irregular\r\nbaked clay and lime mud, a damp course of tarred felt, which cannot\r\npossibly last more than a few years, was inserted about a foot from the\r\nground. Then the wall, being quite insufficient to stand the heavy drift\r\nof weather to which it is exposed, was dabbled over with two coatings of\r\nplaster on the outside, the outermost being given a primitive\r\npicturesqueness by means of a sham surface of rough-cast pebbles and\r\nwhite-wash, while within, to conceal the rough discomfort of the\r\nsurface, successive coatings of plaster, and finally, paper, were added,\r\nwith a wood-skirting at the foot thrice painted. Everything in this was\r\nhand work, the laying of the bricks, the dabbing of the plaster, the\r\nsmoothing of the paper; it is a house built of hands--and some I saw\r\nwere bleeding hands--just as in the days of the pyramids, when the only\r\nengines were living men. The whole confection is now undergoing\r\nincalculable chemical reactions between its several parts. Lime, mortar,\r\nand microscopical organisms are producing undesigned chromatic effects\r\nin the paper and plaster; the plaster, having methods of expansion and\r\ncontraction of its own, crinkles and cracks; the skirting, having\r\nabsorbed moisture and now drying again, opens its joints; the rough-cast\r\ncoquettes with the frost and opens chinks and crannies for the humbler\r\ncreation. I fail to see the necessity of (and, accordingly, I resent\r\nbitterly) all these coral-reef methods. Better walls than this, and\r\nbetter and less life-wasting ways of making them, are surely possible.\r\nIn the wall in question, concrete would have been cheaper and better\r\nthan bricks if only \"the men\" had understood it. But I can dream at last\r\nof much more revolutionary affairs, of a thing running to and fro along\r\na temporary rail, that will squeeze out wall as one squeezes paint from\r\na tube, and form its surface with a pat or two as it sets. Moreover, I\r\ndo not see at all why the walls of small dwelling-houses should be so\r\nsolid as they are. There still hangs about us the monumental traditions\r\nof the pyramids. It ought to be possible to build sound, portable, and\r\nhabitable houses of felted wire-netting and weather-proofed paper upon a\r\nlight framework. This sort of thing is, no doubt, abominably ugly at\r\npresent, but that is because architects and designers, being for the\r\nmost part inordinately cultured and quite uneducated, are unable to cope\r\nwith its fundamentally novel problems. A few energetic men might at any\r\ntime set out to alter all this. And with the inevitable revolutions that\r\nmust come about in domestic fittings, and which I hope to discuss more\r\nfully in the next paper, it is open to question whether many ground\r\nlandlords may not find they have work for the house-breakers rather than\r\nwealth unlimited falling into their hands when the building leases their\r\nsolicitors so ingeniously draw up do at last expire.\r\n\r\n[27] The new aspects of building, for example, that have been brought\r\nabout by the entrance of water and gas into the house, and the\r\napplication of water to sanitation.\r\n\r\n[28] The future of the servant class and the future of the artist are\r\ntwo interesting questions that will be most conveniently mentioned at a\r\nlater stage, when we come to discuss the domestic life in greater detail\r\nthan is possible before we have formed any clear notion of the sort of\r\npeople who will lead that life.\r\n\r\n[29] Even the physical conditions under which the House of Commons meets\r\nand plays at government, are ridiculously obsolete. Every disputable\r\npoint is settled by a division, a bell rings, there is shouting and\r\nrunning, the members come blundering into the chamber and sort\r\nthemselves with much loutish shuffling and shoving into the division\r\nlobbies. They are counted, as illiterate farmers count sheep; amidst\r\nmuch fuss and confusion they return to their places, and the tellers\r\nvociferate the result. The waste of time over these antics is enormous,\r\nand they are often repeated many times in an evening. For the lack of\r\ntime, the House of Commons is unable to perform the most urgent and\r\nnecessary legislative duties--it has this year hung up a cryingly\r\nnecessary Education Bill, a delay that will in the end cost Great\r\nBritain millions--but not a soul in it has had the necessary common\r\nsense to point out that an electrician and an expert locksmith could in\r\na few weeks, and for a few hundred pounds, devise and construct a\r\nmember's desk and key, committee-room tapes and voting-desks, and a\r\ngeneral recording apparatus, that would enable every member within the\r\nprecincts to vote, and that would count, record, and report the votes\r\nwithin the space of a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCERTAIN SOCIAL REACTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to point out and consider certain general ways\r\nin which the various factors and elements in the deliquescent society of\r\nthe present time will react one upon another, and to speculate what\r\ndefinite statements, if any, it may seem reasonable to make about the\r\nindividual people of the year 2000--or thereabouts--from the reaction of\r\nthese classes we have attempted to define.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it may prove convenient to speculate upon the trend of\r\ndevelopment of that class about which we have the most grounds for\r\ncertainty in the coming time. The shareholding class, the rout of the\r\nAbyss, the speculator, may develop in countless ways according to the\r\nvarying development of exterior influences upon them, but of the most\r\ntypical portion of the central body, the section containing the\r\nscientific engineering or scientific medical sort of people, we can\r\npostulate certain tendencies with some confidence. Certain ways of\r\nthought they must develop, certain habits of mind and eye they will\r\nradiate out into the adjacent portions of the social mass. We can even,\r\nI think, deduce some conception of the home in which a fairly typical\r\nexample of this body will be living within a reasonable term of years.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that a man is an engineer or a doctor, for example, should\r\nimply now, and certainly will imply in the future, that he has received\r\nan education of a certain definite type; he will have a general\r\nacquaintance with the scientific interpretation of the universe, and he\r\nwill have acquired certain positive and practical habits of mind. If the\r\nmethods of thought of any individual in this central body are not\r\npractical and positive, he will tend to drift out of it to some more\r\ncongenial employment. He will almost necessarily have a strong\r\nimperative to duty quite apart from whatever theological opinions he may\r\nentertain, because if he has not such an inherent imperative, life will\r\nhave very many more alluring prospects than this. His religious\r\nconclusions, whatever they may be, will be based upon some orderly\r\ntheological system that must have honestly admitted and reconciled his\r\nscientific beliefs; the emotional and mystical elements in his religion\r\nwill be subordinate or absent. Essentially he will be a moral man,\r\ncertainly so far as to exercise self-restraint and live in an ordered\r\nway. Unless this is so, he will be unable to give his principal energies\r\nto thought and work--that is, he will not be a good typical engineer. If\r\nsensuality appear at all largely in this central body, therefore,--a\r\npoint we must leave open here--it will appear without any trappings of\r\nsentiment or mysticism, frankly on Pauline lines, wine for the stomach's\r\nsake, and it is better to marry than to burn, a concession to the flesh\r\nnecessary to secure efficiency. Assuming in our typical case that pure\r\nindulgence does not appear or flares and passes, then either he will be\r\nsingle or more or less married. The import of that \"more or less\" will\r\nbe discussed later, for the present we may very conveniently conceive\r\nhim married under the traditional laws of Christendom. Having a mind\r\nconsiderably engaged, he will not have the leisure for a wife of the\r\ndistracting, perplexing personality kind, and in our typical case, which\r\nwill be a typically sound and successful one, we may picture him wedded\r\nto a healthy, intelligent, and loyal person, who will be her husband's\r\ncompanion in their common leisure, and as mother of their three or four\r\nchildren and manager of his household, as much of a technically capable\r\nindividual as himself. He will be a father of several children, I think,\r\nbecause his scientific mental basis will incline him to see the whole of\r\nlife as a struggle to survive; he will recognize that a childless,\r\nsterile life, however pleasant, is essentially failure and perversion,\r\nand he will conceive his honour involved in the possession of offspring.\r\n\r\nSuch a couple will probably dress with a view to decent convenience,\r\nthey will not set the fashions, as I shall presently point out, but\r\nthey will incline to steady and sober them, they will avoid exciting\r\ncolour contrasts and bizarre contours. They will not be habitually\r\npromenaders, or greatly addicted to theatrical performances; they will\r\nprobably find their secondary interests--the cardinal one will of course\r\nbe the work in hand--in a not too imaginative prose literature, in\r\ntravel and journeys and in the less sensuous aspects of music. They will\r\nprobably take a considerable interest in public affairs. Their _ménage_,\r\nwhich will consist of father, mother, and children, will, I think, in\r\nall probability, be servantless.\r\n\r\nThey will probably not keep a servant for two very excellent reasons,\r\nbecause in the first place they will not want one, and in the second\r\nthey will not get one if they do. A servant is necessary in the small,\r\nmodern house, partly to supplement the deficiencies of the wife, but\r\nmainly to supplement the deficiencies of the house. She comes to cook\r\nand perform various skilled duties that the wife lacks either knowledge\r\nor training, or both, to perform regularly and expeditiously. Usually it\r\nmust be confessed that the servant in the small household fails to\r\nperform these skilled duties completely. But the great proportion of the\r\nservant's duties consists merely in drudgery that the stupidities of our\r\npresent-day method of house construction entail, and which the more\r\nsanely constructed house of the future will avoid. Consider, for\r\ninstance, the wanton disregard of avoidable toil displayed in building\r\nhouses with a service basement without lifts! Then most dusting and\r\nsweeping would be quite avoidable if houses were wiselier done. It is\r\nthe lack of proper warming appliances which necessitates a vast amount\r\nof coal carrying and dirt distribution, and it is this dirt mainly that\r\nhas so painfully to be removed again. The house of the future will\r\nprobably be warmed in its walls from some power-generating station, as,\r\nindeed, already very many houses are lit at the present day. The lack of\r\nsane methods of ventilation also enhances the general dirtiness and\r\ndustiness of the present-day home, and gas-lighting and the use of\r\ntarnishable metals, wherever possible, involve further labour. But air\r\nwill enter the house of the future through proper tubes in the walls,\r\nwhich will warm it and capture its dust, and it will be spun out again\r\nby a simple mechanism. And by simple devices such sweeping as still\r\nremains necessary can be enormously lightened. The fact that in existing\r\nhomes the skirting meets the floor at right angles makes sweeping about\r\ntwice as troublesome as it will be when people have the sense and\r\nability to round off the angle between wall and floor.\r\n\r\nSo one great lump of the servant's toil will practically disappear. Two\r\nothers are already disappearing. In many houses there are still the\r\noffensive duties of filling lamps and blacking boots to be done. Our\r\ncoming house, however, will have no lamps to need filling, and, as for\r\nthe boots, really intelligent people will feel the essential ugliness of\r\nwearing the evidence of constant manual toil upon their persons. They\r\nwill wear sorts of shoes and boots that can be cleaned by wiping in a\r\nminute or so. Take now the bedroom work. The lack of ingenuity in\r\nsanitary fittings at present forbids the obvious convenience of hot and\r\ncold water supply to the bedroom, and there is a mighty fetching and\r\ncarrying of water and slops to be got through daily. All that will\r\ncease. Every bedroom will have its own bath-dressing room which any\r\nwell-bred person will be intelligent and considerate enough to use and\r\nleave without the slightest disarrangement. This, so far as \"upstairs\"\r\ngoes, really only leaves bedmaking to be done, and a bed does not take\r\nfive minutes to make. Downstairs a vast amount of needless labour at\r\npresent arises out of table wear. \"Washing up\" consists of a tedious\r\ncleansing and wiping of each table utensil in turn, whereas it should be\r\npossible to immerse all dirty table wear in a suitable solvent for a few\r\nminutes and then run that off for the articles to dry. The application\r\nof solvents to window cleaning, also, would be a possible thing but for\r\nthe primitive construction of our windows, which prevents anything but a\r\npainful rub, rub, rub, with the leather. A friend of mine in domestic\r\nservice tells me that this rubbing is to get the window dry, and this\r\nseems to be the general impression, but I think it incorrect. The water\r\nis not an adequate solvent, and enough cannot be used under existing\r\nconditions. Consequently, if the window is cleaned and left wet, it\r\ndries in drops, and these drops contain dirt in solution which remain as\r\nspots. But water containing a suitable solvent could quite simply be\r\nmade to run down a window for a few minutes from pinholes in a pipe\r\nabove into a groove below, and this could be followed by pure rain water\r\nfor an equal time, and in this way the whole window cleaning in the\r\nhouse could, I imagine, be reduced to the business of turning on a tap.\r\n\r\nThere remains the cooking. To-day cooking, with its incidentals, is a\r\nvery serious business; the coaling, the ashes, the horrible moments of\r\nheat, the hot black things to handle, the silly vague recipes, the want\r\nof neat apparatus, and the want of intelligence to demand or use neat\r\napparatus. One always imagines a cook working with a crimsoned face and\r\nbare blackened arms. But with a neat little range, heated by electricity\r\nand provided with thermometers, with absolutely controllable\r\ntemperatures and proper heat screens, cooking might very easily be made\r\na pleasant amusement for intelligent invalid ladies. Which reminds one,\r\nby-the-by, as an added detail to our previous sketch of the scenery of\r\nthe days to come, that there will be no chimneys at all to the house of\r\nthe future of this type, except the flue for the kitchen smells.[30]\r\nThis will not only abolish the chimney stack, but make the roof a clean\r\nand pleasant addition to the garden spaces of the home.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long all these things will take to arrive. The\r\nerection of a series of experimental labour-saving houses by some\r\nphilanthropic person, for exhibition and discussion, would certainly\r\nbring about a very extraordinary advance in domestic comfort even in the\r\nimmediate future, but the fashions in philanthropy do not trend in such\r\npractical directions; if they did, the philanthropic person would\r\nprobably be too amenable to flattery to escape the pushful patentee and\r\ntoo sensitive to avail himself of criticism (which rarely succeeds in\r\nbeing both penetrating and polite), and it will probably be many years\r\nbefore the cautious enterprise of advertising firms approximates to the\r\neconomies that are theoretically possible to-day. But certainly the\r\nengineering and medical sorts of person will be best able to appreciate\r\nthe possibilities of cutting down the irksome labours of the\r\ncontemporary home, and most likely to first demand and secure them.\r\n\r\nThe wife of this ideal home may probably have a certain distaste for\r\nvicarious labour, that so far as the immediate minimum of duties goes\r\nwill probably carry her through them. There will be few servants\r\nobtainable for the small homes of the future, and that may strengthen\r\nher sentiments. Hardly any woman seems to object to a system of things\r\nwhich provides that another woman should be made rough-handed and kept\r\nrough-minded for her sake, but with the enormous diffusion of levelling\r\ninformation that is going on, a perfectly valid objection will probably\r\ncome from the other side in this transaction. The servants of the past\r\nand the only good servants of to-day are the children of servants or the\r\nchildren of the old labour base of the social pyramid, until recently a\r\nnecessary and self-respecting element in the State. Machinery has\r\nsmashed that base and scattered its fragments; the tradition of\r\nself-respecting inferiority is being utterly destroyed in the world. The\r\ncontingents of the Abyss, even, will not supply daughters for this\r\npurpose. In the community of the United States no native-born race of\r\nwhite servants has appeared, and the emancipated young negress\r\ndegenerates towards the impossible--which is one of the many stimulants\r\nto small ingenuities that may help very powerfully to give that nation\r\nthe industrial leadership of the world. The servant of the future, if\r\nindeed she should still linger in the small household, will be a person\r\nalive to a social injustice and the unsuccessful rival of the wife. Such\r\nservants as wealth will retain will be about as really loyal and servile\r\nas hotel waiters, and on the same terms. For the middling sort of\r\npeople in the future maintaining a separate _ménage_ there is nothing\r\nfor it but the practically automatic house or flat, supplemented,\r\nperhaps, by the restaurant or the hotel.\r\n\r\nAlmost certainly, for reasons detailed in the second chapter of these\r\nAnticipations, this household, if it is an ideal type, will be situated\r\naway from the central \"Town\" nucleus and in pleasant surroundings. And I\r\nimagine that the sort of woman who would be mother and mistress of such\r\na home would not be perfectly content unless there were a garden about\r\nthe house. On account of the servant difficulty, again, this garden\r\nwould probably be less laboriously neat than many of our gardens\r\nto-day--no \"bedding-out,\" for example, and a certain parsimony of mown\r\nlawn....\r\n\r\nTo such a type of home it seems the active, scientifically trained\r\npeople will tend. But usually, I think, the prophet is inclined to over\r\nestimate the number of people who will reach this condition of affairs\r\nin a generation or so, and to under estimate the conflicting tendencies\r\nthat will make its attainment difficult to all, and impossible to many,\r\nand that will for many years tint and blotch the achievement of those\r\nwho succeed with patches of unsympathetic colour. To understand just how\r\nmodifications may come in, it is necessary to consider the probable line\r\nof development of another of the four main elements in the social body\r\nof the coming time. As a consequence and visible expression of the\r\ngreat new growth of share and stock property there will be scattered\r\nthrough the whole social body, concentrated here perhaps, and diffused\r\nthere, but everywhere perceived, the members of that new class of the\r\nirresponsible wealthy, a class, as I have already pointed out in the\r\npreceding chapter, miscellaneous and free to a degree quite\r\nunprecedented in the world's history. Quite inevitably great sections of\r\nthis miscellany will develop characteristics almost diametrically\r\nopposed to those of the typical working expert class, and their\r\ngravitational attraction may influence the lives of this more efficient,\r\nfinally more powerful, but at present much less wealthy, class to a very\r\nconsiderable degree of intimacy.\r\n\r\nThe rich shareholder and the skilled expert must necessarily be sharply\r\ncontrasted types, and of the two it must be borne in mind that it is the\r\nrich shareholder who spends the money. While occupation and skill\r\nincline one towards severity and economy, leisure and unlimited means\r\ninvolve relaxation and demand the adventitious interest of decoration.\r\nThe shareholder will be the decorative influence in the State. So far as\r\nthere will be a typical shareholder's house, we may hazard that it will\r\nhave rich colours, elaborate hangings, stained glass adornments, and\r\nadded interests in great abundance. This \"leisure class\" will certainly\r\nemploy the greater proportion of the artists, decorators, fabric makers,\r\nand the like, of the coming time. It will dominate the world of\r\nart--and we may say, with some confidence, that it will influence it in\r\ncertain directions. For example, standing apart from the movement of the\r\nworld, as they will do to a very large extent, the archaic, opulently\r\ndone, will appeal irresistibly to very many of these irresponsible rich\r\nas the very quintessence of art. They will come to art with uncritical,\r\ncultured minds, full of past achievements, ignorant of present\r\nnecessities. Art will be something added to life--something stuck on and\r\nrichly reminiscent--not a manner pervading all real things. We may be\r\npretty sure that very few will grasp the fact that an iron bridge or a\r\nrailway engine may be artistically done--these will not be \"art\"\r\nobjects, but hostile novelties. And, on the other hand, we can pretty\r\nconfidently foretell a spacious future and much amplification for that\r\nturgid, costly, and deliberately anti-contemporary group of styles of\r\nwhich William Morris and his associates have been the fortunate\r\npioneers. And the same principles will apply to costume. A\r\nnon-functional class of people cannot have a functional costume, the\r\nwhole scheme of costume, as it will be worn by the wealthy classes in\r\nthe coming years, will necessarily be of that character which is called\r\nfancy dress. Few people will trouble to discover the most convenient\r\nforms and materials, and endeavour to simplify them and reduce them to\r\nbeautiful forms, while endless enterprising tradesmen will be alert for\r\na perpetual succession of striking novelties. The women will ransack the\r\nages for becoming and alluring anachronisms, the men will appear in the\r\nelaborate uniforms of \"games,\" in modifications of \"court\" dress, in\r\npicturesque revivals of national costumes, in epidemic fashions of the\r\nmost astonishing sort....\r\n\r\nNow, these people, so far as they are spenders of money, and so far as\r\nhe is a spender of money, will stand to this ideal engineering sort of\r\nperson, who is the vitally important citizen of a progressive scientific\r\nState, in a competitive relation. In most cases, whenever there is\r\nsomething that both want, one against the other, the shareholder will\r\nget it; in most cases, where it is a matter of calling the tune, the\r\nshareholder will call the tune. For example, the young architect,\r\nconscious of exceptional ability, will have more or less clearly before\r\nhim the alternatives of devoting himself to the novel, intricate, and\r\ndifficult business of designing cheap, simple, and mechanically\r\nconvenient homes for people who will certainly not be highly\r\nremunerative, and will probably be rather acutely critical, or of\r\nperfecting himself in some period of romantic architecture, or striking\r\nout some startling and attractive novelty of manner or material which\r\nwill be certain, sooner or later, to meet its congenial shareholder.\r\nEven if he hover for a time between these alternatives, he will need to\r\nbe a person not only of exceptional gifts, but what is by no means a\r\ncommon accompaniment of exceptional gifts, exceptional strength of\r\ncharacter, to take the former line. Consequently, for many years yet,\r\nmost of the experimental buildings and novel designs, that initiate\r\ndiscussion and develop the general taste, will be done primarily to\r\nplease the more originative shareholders and not to satisfy the demands\r\nof our engineer or doctor; and the strictly commercial builders, who\r\nwill cater for all but the wealthiest engineers, scientific\r\ninvestigators, and business men, being unable to afford specific\r\ndesigns, will--amidst the disregarded curses of these more intelligent\r\ncustomers--still simply reproduce in a cheaper and mutilated form such\r\nexamples as happen to be set. Practically, that is to say, the\r\nshareholder will buy up almost all the available architectural talent.\r\n\r\nThis modifies our conception of the outer appearance of that little\r\nhouse we imagined. Unless it happens to be the house of an exceptionally\r\nprosperous member of the utilitarian professions, it will lack something\r\nof the neat directness implicit in our description, something of that\r\ninevitable beauty that arises out of the perfect attainment of ends--for\r\nvery many years, at any rate. It will almost certainly be tinted, it may\r\neven be saturated, with the secondhand archaic. The owner may object,\r\nbut a busy man cannot stop his life work to teach architects what they\r\nought to know. It may be heated electrically, but it will have sham\r\nchimneys, in whose darkness, unless they are built solid, dust and\r\nfilth will gather, and luckless birds and insects pass horrible last\r\nhours of ineffectual struggle. It may have automatic window-cleaning\r\narrangements, but they will be hidden by \"picturesque\" mullions. The\r\nsham chimneys will, perhaps, be made to smoke genially in winter by some\r\ningenious contrivance, there may be sham open fireplaces within, with\r\ningle nooks about the sham glowing logs. The needlessly steep roofs will\r\nhave a sham sag and sham timbered gables, and probably forced lichens\r\nwill give it a sham appearance of age. Just that feeble-minded\r\ncontemporary shirking of the truth of things that has given the world\r\nsuch stockbroker in armour affairs as the Tower Bridge and historical\r\nromance, will, I fear, worry the lucid mind in a great multitude of the\r\nhomes that the opening half, at least, of this century will produce.\r\n\r\nIn quite a similar way the shareholding body will buy up all the clever\r\nand more enterprising makers and designers of clothing and adornment, he\r\nwill set the fashion of almost all ornament, in bookbinding and printing\r\nand painting, for example, furnishing, and indeed of almost all things\r\nthat are not primarily produced \"for the million,\" as the phrase goes.\r\nAnd where that sort of thing comes in, then, so far as the trained and\r\nintelligent type of man goes, for many years yet it will be simply a\r\ncase of the nether instead of the upper millstone. Just how far the\r\ninfluence and contagion of the shareholding mass will reach into this\r\nimaginary household of non-shareholding efficients, and just how far the\r\ninfluence of science and mechanism will penetrate the minds and methods\r\nof the rich, becomes really one of the most important questions with\r\nwhich these speculations will deal. For this argument that he will\r\nperhaps be able to buy up the architect and the tailor and the decorator\r\nand so forth is merely preliminary to the graver issue. It is just\r\npossible that the shareholder may, to a very large extent--in a certain\r\nfigurative sense, at least--buy up much of the womankind that would\r\notherwise be available to constitute those severe, capable, and probably\r\nby no means unhappy little establishments to which our typical engineers\r\nwill tend, and so prevent many women from becoming mothers of a\r\nregenerating world. The huge secretion of irresponsible wealth by the\r\nsocial organism is certain to affect the tone of thought of the entire\r\nfeminine sex profoundly--the exact nature of this influence we may now\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nThe gist of this inquiry lies in the fact that, while a man's starting\r\nposition in this world of to-day is entirely determined by the\r\nconditions of his birth and early training, and his final position the\r\nslow elaborate outcome of his own sustained efforts to live, a woman,\r\nfrom the age of sixteen onward--as the world goes now--is essentially\r\nadventurous, the creature of circumstances largely beyond her control\r\nand foresight. A virile man, though he, too, is subject to accidents,\r\nmay, upon most points, still hope to plan and determine his life; the\r\nlife of a woman is all accident. Normally she lives in relation to some\r\nspecific man, and until that man is indicated her preparation for life\r\nmust be of the most tentative sort. She lives, going nowhere, like a\r\ncabman on the crawl, and at any time she may find it open to her to\r\nassist some pleasure-loving millionaire to spend his millions, or to\r\nplay her part in one of the many real, original, and only derivatives of\r\nthe former aristocratic \"Society\" that have developed themselves among\r\nindependent people. Even if she is a serious and labour-loving type,\r\nsome shareholder may tempt her with the prospect of developing her\r\nexceptional personality in ease and freedom and in \"doing good\" with his\r\nmoney. With the continued growth of the shareholding class, the\r\nbrighter-looking matrimonial chances, not to speak of the glittering\r\nopportunities that are not matrimonial, will increase. Reading is now\r\nthe privilege of all classes, there are few secrets of etiquette that a\r\nclever lower-class girl will fail to learn, there are few such girls,\r\neven now, who are not aware of their wide opportunities, or at least\r\ntheir wide possibilities, of luxury and freedom, there are still fewer\r\nwho, knowing as much, do not let it affect their standards and\r\nconception of life. The whole mass of modern fiction written by women\r\nfor women, indeed, down to the cheapest novelettes, is saturated with\r\nthe romance of _mésalliance_. And even when the specific man has\r\nappeared, the adventurous is still not shut out of a woman's career. A\r\nman's affections may wander capriciously and leave him but a little\r\npoorer or a little better placed; for the women they wander from,\r\nhowever, the issue is an infinitely graver one, and the serious\r\nwandering of a woman's fancy may mean the beginning of a new world for\r\nher. At any moment the chances of death may make the wife a widow, may\r\nsweep out of existence all that she had made fundamental in her life,\r\nmay enrich her with insurance profits or hurl her into poverty, and\r\nrestore all the drifting expectancy of her adolescence....\r\n\r\nNow, it is difficult to say why we should expect the growing girl, in\r\nwhom an unlimited ambition and egotism is as natural and proper a thing\r\nas beauty and high spirits, to deny herself some dalliance with the more\r\nopulent dreams that form the golden lining to these precarious\r\nprospects? How can we expect her to prepare herself solely, putting all\r\nwandering thoughts aside, for the servantless cookery, domestic\r\nKindergarten work, the care of hardy perennials, and low-pitched\r\nconversation of the engineer's home? Supposing, after all, there is no\r\npredestinate engineer! The stories the growing girl now prefers, and I\r\nimagine will in the future still prefer, deal mainly with the rich and\r\nfree; the theatre she will prefer to visit will present the lives and\r\nloves of opulent people with great precision and detailed correctness;\r\nher favourite periodicals will reflect that life; her schoolmistress,\r\nwhatever her principles, must have an eye to her \"chances.\" And even\r\nafter Fate or a gust of passion has whirled her into the arms of our\r\nbusy and capable fundamental man, all these things will still be in her\r\nimagination and memory. Unless he is a person of extraordinary mental\r\nprepotency, she will almost insensibly determine the character of the\r\nhome in a direction quite other than that of our first sketch. She will\r\nset herself to realize, as far as her husband's means and credit permit,\r\nthe ideas of the particular section of the wealthy that have captured\r\nher. If she is a fool, her ideas of life will presently come into\r\ncomplete conflict with her husband's in a manner that, as the fumes of\r\nthe love potion leave his brain, may bring the real nature of the case\r\nhome to him. If he is of that resolute strain to whom the world must\r\nfinally come, he may rebel and wade through tears and crises to his\r\nappointed work again. The cleverer she is, and the finer and more loyal\r\nher character up to a certain point, the less likely this is to happen,\r\nthe more subtle and effective will be her hold upon her husband, and the\r\nmore probable his perversion from the austere pursuit of some\r\ninteresting employment, towards the adventures of modern money-getting\r\nin pursuit of her ideals of a befitting life. And meanwhile, since \"one\r\nmust live,\" the nursery that was implicit in the background of the first\r\npicture will probably prove unnecessary. She will be, perforce, a\r\nperson not only of pleasant pursuits, but of leisure. If she endears\r\nherself to her husband, he will feel not only the attraction but the\r\nduty of her vacant hours; he will not only deflect his working hours\r\nfrom the effective to the profitable, but that occasional burning of the\r\nmidnight oil, that no brain-worker may forego if he is to retain his\r\nefficiency, will, in the interests of some attractive theatrical\r\nperformance or some agreeable social occasion, all too frequently have\r\nto be put off or abandoned.\r\n\r\nThis line of speculation, therefore, gives us a second picture of a\r\nhousehold to put beside our first, a household, or rather a couple,\r\nrather more likely to be typical of the mass of middling sort of people\r\nin those urban regions of the future than our first projection. It will\r\nprobably not live in a separate home at all, but in a flat in \"Town,\" or\r\nat one of the subordinate centres of the urban region we have foreseen.\r\nThe apartments will be more or less agreeably adorned in some decorative\r\nfashion akin to but less costly than some of the many fashions that will\r\nobtain among the wealthy. They will be littered with a miscellaneous\r\nliterature, novels of an entertaining and stimulating sort\r\npredominating, and with _bric-à-brac_; in a childless household there\r\nmust certainly be quaint dolls, pet images, and so forth, and perhaps a\r\ncanary would find a place. I suspect there would be an edition or so of\r\n\"Omar\" about in this more typical household of \"Moderns,\" but I doubt\r\nabout the Bible. The man's working books would probably be shabby and\r\nrelegated to a small study, and even these overlaid by abundant copies\r\nof the _Financial_--something or other. It would still be a servantless\r\nhousehold, and probably not only without a nursery but without a\r\nkitchen, and in its grade and degree it would probably have social\r\nrelations directly or intermediately through rich friends with some\r\nsection, some one of the numerous cults of the quite independent\r\nwealthy.\r\n\r\nQuite similar households to this would be even more common among those\r\nneither independent nor engaged in work of a primarily functional\r\nnature, but endeavouring quite ostensibly to acquire wealth by political\r\nor business ingenuity and activity, and also among the great multitude\r\nof artists, writers, and that sort of people, whose works are their\r\nchildren. In comparison with the state of affairs fifty years ago, the\r\nchild-infested household is already conspicuously rare in these classes.\r\n\r\nThese are two highly probably _ménages_ among the central mass of the\r\npeople of the coming time. But there will be many others. The _ménage à\r\ndeux_, one may remark, though it may be without the presence of\r\nchildren, is not necessarily childless. Parentage is certainly part of\r\nthe pride of many men--though, curiously enough, it does not appear to\r\nbe felt among modern European married women as any part of their\r\nhonour. Many men will probably achieve parentage, therefore, who will\r\nnot succeed in inducing, or who may possibly even be very loth to\r\npermit, their wives to undertake more than the first beginnings of\r\nmotherhood. From the moment of its birth, unless it is kept as a pet,\r\nthe child of such marriages will be nourished, taught, and trained\r\nalmost as though it were an orphan, it will have a succession of bottles\r\nand foster-mothers for body and mind from the very beginning. Side by\r\nside with this increasing number of childless homes, therefore, there\r\nmay develop a system of Kindergarten boarding schools. Indeed, to a\r\ncertain extent such schools already exist, and it is one of the\r\nunperceived contrasts of this and any former time how common such a\r\nseparation of parents and children becomes. Except in the case of the\r\nillegitimate and orphans, and the children of impossible (many\r\npublic-house children, _e.g._), or wretched homes, boarding schools\r\nuntil quite recently were used only for quite big boys and girls. But\r\nnow, at every seaside town, for example, one sees a multitude of\r\npreparatory schools, which are really not simply educational\r\ninstitutions, but supplementary homes. In many cases these are conducted\r\nand very largely staffed by unmarried girls and women who are indeed, in\r\neffect, assistant mothers. This class of capable schoolmistresses is one\r\nof the most interesting social developments of this period. For the most\r\npart they are women who from emotional fastidiousness, intellectual\r\negotism, or an honest lack of passion, have refused the common lot of\r\nmarriage, women often of exceptional character and restraint, and it is\r\nwell that, at any rate, their intelligence and character should not pass\r\nfruitlessly out of being. Assuredly for this type the future has much in\r\nstore.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, still other possibilities to be considered in this\r\nmatter. In these Anticipations it is impossible to ignore the forces\r\nmaking for a considerable relaxation of the institution of permanent\r\nmonogamous marriage in the coming years, and of a much greater variety\r\nof establishments than is suggested by these possibilities within the\r\npale. I guess, without attempting to refer to statistics, that our\r\npresent society must show a quite unprecedented number and increasing\r\nnumber of male and female celibates--not religious celibates, but\r\npeople, for the most part, whose standard of personal comfort has such a\r\nrelation to their earning power that they shirk or cannot enter the\r\nmatrimonial grouping. The institution of permanent monogamous\r\nmarriage--except in the ideal Roman Catholic community, where it is\r\nbased on the sanction of an authority which in real Roman Catholic\r\ncountries a large proportion of the men decline to obey--is sustained at\r\npresent entirely by the inertia of custom, and by a number of\r\nsentimental and practical considerations, considerations that may very\r\npossibly undergo modification in the face of the altered relationship of\r\nhusband and wife that the present development of childless _ménages_ is\r\nbringing about. The practical and sustaining reason for monogamy is the\r\nstability it gives to the family; the value of a stable family lies in\r\nthe orderly upbringing in an atmosphere of affection that it secures in\r\nmost cases for its more or less numerous children. The monogamous family\r\nhas indisputably been the civilizing unit of the pre-mechanical\r\ncivilized state. It must be remembered that both for husband and wife in\r\nmost cases monogamic life marriage involves an element of sacrifice, it\r\nis an institution of late appearance in the history of mankind, and it\r\ndoes not completely fit the psychology or physiology of any but very\r\nexceptional characters in either sex. For the man it commonly involves\r\nconsiderable restraint; he must ride his imagination on the curb, or\r\nexceed the code in an extremely dishonouring, furtive, and\r\nunsatisfactory manner while publicly professing an impossible virtue;\r\nfor the woman it commonly implies many uncongenial submissions. There\r\nare probably few married couples who have escaped distressful phases of\r\nbitterness and tears, within the constraint of their, in most cases,\r\npractically insoluble bond. But, on the other hand, and as a reward that\r\nin the soberer, mainly agricultural civilization of the past, and among\r\nthe middling class of people, at any rate, has sufficed, there comes\r\nthe great development of associations and tendernesses that arises out\r\nof intimate co-operation in an established home, and particularly out of\r\nthe linking love and interest of children's lives....\r\n\r\nBut how does this fit into the childless, disunited, and probably\r\nshifting _ménage_ of our second picture?\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that it has been the middling and lower mass of\r\npeople, the tenants and agriculturists, the shopkeepers, and so forth,\r\nmen needing before all things the absolutely loyal help of wives, that\r\nhas sustained permanent monogamic marriage whenever it has been\r\nsustained. Public monogamy has existed on its merits--that is, on the\r\nmerits of the wife. Merely ostensible reasons have never sufficed. No\r\nsort of religious conviction, without a real practical utility, has ever\r\navailed to keep classes of men, unhampered by circumstances, to its\r\nrestrictions. In all times, and holding all sorts of beliefs, the\r\nspecimen humanity of courts and nobilities is to be found developing the\r\nmost complex qualifications of the code. In some quiet corner of Elysium\r\nthe bishops of the early Georges, the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the\r\ncontemporary French and Spanish courts, the patriarchs of vanished\r\nByzantium, will find a common topic with the spiritual advisers of the\r\nkingdoms of the East in this difficult theme,--the theme of the\r\nconcessions permissible and expedient to earnest believers encumbered\r\nwith leisure and a superfluity of power.... It is not necessary to\r\ndiscuss religious development, therefore, before deciding this issue. We\r\nare dealing now with things deeper and forces infinitely more powerful\r\nthan the mere convictions of men.\r\n\r\nWill a generation to whom marriage will be no longer necessarily\r\nassociated with the birth and rearing of children, or with the immediate\r\nco-operation and sympathy of husband and wife in common proceedings,\r\nretain its present feeling for the extreme sanctity of the permanent\r\nbond? Will the agreeable, unemployed, childless woman, with a high\r\nconception of her personal rights, who is spending her husband's\r\nearnings or income in some pleasant discrepant manner, a type of woman\r\nthere are excellent reasons for anticipating will become more\r\nfrequent--will she continue to share the honours and privileges of the\r\nwife, mother, and helper of the old dispensation? and in particular,\r\nwill the great gulf that is now fixed by custom between her and the\r\nagreeable unmarried lady who is similarly employed remain so inexorably\r\nwide? Charity is in the air, and why should not charming people meet one\r\nanother? And where is either of these ladies to find the support that\r\nwill enable her to insist upon the monopoly that conventional sentiment,\r\nso far as it finds expression, concedes her? The danger to them both of\r\nthe theory of equal liberty is evident enough. On the other hand, in the\r\ncase of the unmarried mother who may be helped to hold her own, or who\r\nmay be holding her own in the world, where will the moral censor of the\r\nyear 1950 find his congenial following to gather stones? Much as we may\r\nregret it, it does very greatly affect the realities of this matter,\r\nthat with the increased migration of people from home to home amidst the\r\nlarge urban regions that, we have concluded, will certainly obtain in\r\nthe future, even if moral reprobation and minor social inconveniences do\r\nstill attach to certain sorts of status, it will probably be\r\nincreasingly difficult to determine the status of people who wish to\r\nconceal it for any but criminal ends.\r\n\r\nIn another direction there must be a movement towards the relaxation of\r\nthe marriage law and of divorce that will complicate status very\r\nconfusingly. In the past it has been possible to sustain several\r\ncontrasting moral systems in each of the practically autonomous states\r\nof the world, but with a development and cheapening of travel and\r\nmigration that is as yet only in its opening phase, an increasing\r\nconflict between dissimilar moral restrictions must appear. Even at\r\npresent, with only the most prosperous classes of the American and\r\nWestern European countries migrating at all freely, there is a growing\r\namount of inconvenience arising out of these--from the point of view of\r\nsocial physiology--quite arbitrary differences. A man or woman may, for\r\nexample, have been the injured party in some conjugal complication, may\r\nhave established a domicile and divorced the erring spouse in certain\r\nof the United States, may have married again there with absolute local\r\npropriety, and may be a bigamist and a criminal in England. A child may\r\nbe a legal child in Denmark or Australia, and a bastard in this austerer\r\nclimate. These things are, however, only the first intimations of much\r\nmore profound reactions. Almost all the great European Powers, and the\r\nUnited States also, are extending their boundaries to include great\r\nmasses of non-Christian polygamous peoples, and they are permeating\r\nthese peoples with railways, printed matter, and all the stimulants of\r\nour present state. With the spread of these conveniences there is no\r\ncorresponding spread of Christianity. These people will not always\r\nremain in the ring fence of their present regions; their superseded\r\nprinces, and rulers, and public masters, and managers, will presently\r\ncome to swell the shareholding mass of the appropriating Empire.\r\nEuropeans, on the other hand, will drift into these districts, and under\r\nthe influence of their customs, intermarriages and interracial reaction\r\nwill increase; in a world which is steadily abolishing locality, the\r\ncompromise of local concessions, of localized recognition of the \"custom\r\nof the country,\" cannot permanently avail. Statesmen will have to face\r\nthe alternative of either widening the permissible variations of the\r\nmarriage contract, or of acute racial and religious stresses, of a vast\r\nvariety of possible legal betrayals, and the appearance of a body of\r\nself-respecting people, outside the law and public respect, a body that\r\nwill confer a touch of credit upon, because it will share the stigma of,\r\nthe deliberately dissolute and criminal. And whether the moral law\r\nshrivels relatively by mere exclusiveness--as in religious matters the\r\nChurch of England, for example, has shrivelled to the proportions of a\r\nmere sectarian practice--or whether it broadens itself to sustain\r\njustice in a variety of sexual contracts, the nett result, so far as our\r\npresent purpose goes, will be the same. All these forces, making for\r\nmoral relaxation in the coming time, will probably be greatly enhanced\r\nby the line of development certain sections of the irresponsible wealthy\r\nwill almost certainly follow.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat that the shareholding rich man of the new time is in a\r\nposition of freedom almost unparalleled in the history of men. He has\r\nsold his permission to control and experiment with the material wealth\r\nof the community for freedom--for freedom from care, labour,\r\nresponsibility, custom, local usage and local attachment. He may come\r\nback again into public affairs if he likes--that is his private concern.\r\nWithin the limits of the law and his capacity and courage, he may do as\r\nthe imagination of his heart directs. Now, such an experimental and\r\nimperfect creature as man, a creature urged by such imperious passions,\r\nso weak in imagination and controlled by so feeble a reason, receives\r\nsuch absolute freedom as this only at infinite peril. To a great number\r\nof these people, in the second or third generation, this freedom will\r\nmean vice, the subversion of passion to inconsequent pleasures. We have\r\non record, in the personal history of the Roman emperors, how freedom\r\nand uncontrolled power took one representative group of men, men not\r\nentirely of one blood nor of one bias, but reinforced by the arbitrary\r\ncaprice of adoption and political revolution. We have in the history of\r\nthe Russian empresses a glimpse of similar feminine possibilities. We\r\nare moving towards a time when, through this confusion of moral\r\nstandards I have foretold, the pressure of public opinion in these\r\nmatters must be greatly relaxed, when religion will no longer speak with\r\na unanimous voice, and when freedom of escape from disapproving\r\nneighbours will be greatly facilitated. In the past, when depravity had\r\na centre about a court, the contagion of its example was limited to the\r\ncourt region, but every idle rich man of this great, various, and widely\r\ndiffused class, will play to a certain extent the moral _rôle_ of a\r\ncourt. In these days of universal reading and vivid journalism, every\r\nnovel infraction of the code will be known of, thought about, and more\r\nor less thoroughly discussed by an enormous and increasing proportion of\r\nthe common people. In the past it has been possible for the churches to\r\nmaintain an attitude of respectful regret towards the lapses of the\r\ngreat, and even to co-operate in these lapses with a sympathetic\r\nprivacy, while maintaining a wholesome rigour towards vulgar vice. But\r\nin the coming time there will be no Great, but many rich, the middling\r\nsort of people will probably be better educated as a whole than the\r\nrich, and the days of their differential treatment are at an end.\r\n\r\nIt is foolish, in view of all these things, not to anticipate and\r\nprepare for a state of things when not only will moral standards be\r\nshifting and uncertain, admitting of physiologically sound _ménages_ of\r\nvery variable status, but also when vice and depravity, in every form\r\nthat is not absolutely penal, will be practised in every grade of\r\nmagnificence and condoned. This means that not only will status cease to\r\nbe simple and become complex and varied, but that outside the system of\r\n_ménages_ now recognized, and under the disguise of which all other\r\n_ménages_ shelter, there will be a vast drifting and unstable population\r\ngrouped in almost every conceivable form of relation. The world of\r\nGeorgian England was a world of Homes; the world of the coming time will\r\nstill have its Homes, its real Mothers, the custodians of the human\r\nsuccession, and its cared-for children, the inheritors of the future,\r\nbut in addition to this Home world, frothing tumultuously over and\r\namidst these stable rocks, there will be an enormous complex of\r\nestablishments, and hotels, and sterile households, and flats, and all\r\nthe elaborate furnishing and appliances of a luxurious extinction.\r\n\r\nAnd since in the present social chaos there does not yet exist any\r\nconsiderable body of citizens--comparable to the agricultural and\r\ncommercial middle class of England during the period of limited\r\nmonarchy--that will be practically unanimous in upholding any body of\r\nrules of moral restraint, since there will probably not appear for some\r\ngenerations any body propounding with wide-reaching authority a new\r\ndefinitely different code to replace the one that is now likely to be\r\nincreasingly disregarded, it follows that the present code with a few\r\ninterlined qualifications and grudging legal concessions will remain\r\nnominally operative in sentiment and practice while being practically\r\ndisregarded, glossed, or replaced in numberless directions. It must be\r\npointed out that in effect, what is here forecast for questions of\r\n_ménage_ and moral restraints has already happened to a very large\r\nextent in religious matters. There was a time when it was held--and I\r\nthink rightly--that a man's religious beliefs, and particularly his\r\nmethod of expressing them, was a part not of his individual but of his\r\nsocial life. But the great upheavals of the Reformation resulted finally\r\nin a compromise, a sort of truce, that has put religious belief very\r\nlargely out of intercourse and discussion. It is conceded that within\r\nthe bounds of the general peace and security a man may believe and\r\nexpress his belief in matters of religion as he pleases, not because it\r\nis better so, but because for the present epoch there is no way nor\r\nhope of attaining unanimous truth. There is a decided tendency that\r\nwill, I believe, prevail towards the same compromise in the question of\r\nprivate morals. There is a convention to avoid all discussion of creeds\r\nin general social intercourse; and a similar convention to avoid the\r\npoint of status in relation to marriage, one may very reasonably\r\nanticipate, will be similarly recognized.\r\n\r\nBut this impending dissolution of a common standard of morals does not\r\nmean universal depravity until some great reconstruction obtains any\r\nmore than the obsolescence of the Conventicle Act means universal\r\nirreligion. It means that for one Morality there will be many\r\nmoralities. Each human being will, in the face of circumstances, work\r\nout his or her particular early training as his or her character\r\ndetermines. And although there will be a general convention upon which\r\nthe most diverse people will meet, it will only be with persons who have\r\ncome to identical or similar conclusions in the matter of moral conduct\r\nand who are living in similar _ménages_, just as now it is only with\r\npeople whose conversation implies a certain community or kinship of\r\nreligious belief, that really frequent and intimate intercourse will go\r\non. In other words, there will be a process of moral segregation[31] set\r\nup. Indeed, such a process is probably already in operation, amidst the\r\ndeliquescent social mass. People will be drawn together into little\r\ngroups of similar _ménages_ having much in common. And this--in view of\r\nthe considerations advanced in the first two chapters, considerations\r\nall converging on the practical abolition of distances and the general\r\nfreedom of people to live anywhere they like over large areas--will mean\r\nvery frequently an actual local segregation. There will be districts\r\nthat will be clearly recognized and marked as \"nice,\" fast regions,\r\nareas of ramshackle Bohemianism, regions of earnest and active work,\r\nold-fashioned corners and Hill Tops. Whole regions will be set aside for\r\nthe purposes of opulent enjoyment--a thing already happening, indeed, at\r\npoints along the Riviera to-day. Already the superficial possibilities\r\nof such a segregation have been glanced at. It has been pointed out that\r\nthe enormous urban region of the future may present an extraordinary\r\nvariety of districts, suburbs, and subordinate centres within its\r\nlimiting boundaries, and here we have a very definite enforcement of\r\nthat probability.\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter I spoke of boating centres and horsey suburbs,\r\nand picturesque hilly districts and living places by the sea, of\r\npromenade centres and theatrical districts; I hinted at various fashions\r\nin architecture, and suchlike things, but these exterior appearances\r\nwill be but the outward and visible sign of inward and more spiritual\r\ndistinctions. The people who live in the good hunting country and about\r\nthat glittering Grand Stand, will no longer be even pretending to live\r\nunder the same code as those picturesque musical people who have\r\nconcentrated on the canoe-dotted river. Where the promenaders gather,\r\nand the bands are playing, and the pretty little theatres compete, the\r\npleasure seeker will be seeking such pleasure as he pleases, no longer\r\ndebased by furtiveness and innuendo, going his primrose path to a\r\ncongenial, picturesque, happy and highly desirable extinction. Just over\r\nthe hills, perhaps, a handful of opulent shareholders will be pleasantly\r\npreserving the old traditions of a landed aristocracy, with servants,\r\ntenants, vicar, and other dependents all complete, and what from the\r\npoint of view of social physiology will really be an arrested contingent\r\nof the Abyss, but all nicely washed and done good to, will pursue home\r\nindustries in model cottages in a quite old English and exemplary\r\nmanner. Here the windmills will spin and the waterfalls be trapped to\r\ngather force, and the quiet-eyed master of the machinery will have his\r\noffice and perhaps his private home. Here about the great college and\r\nits big laboratories there will be men and women reasoning and studying;\r\nand here, where the homes thicken among the ripe gardens, one will hear\r\nthe laughter of playing children, the singing of children in their\r\nschools, and see their little figures going to and fro amidst the trees\r\nand flowers....\r\n\r\nAnd these segregations, based primarily on a difference in moral ideas\r\nand pursuits and ideals, will probably round off and complete themselves\r\nat last as distinct and separate cultures. As the moral ideas realize\r\nthemselves in _ménage_ and habits, so the ideals will seek to find\r\nexpression in a literature, and the passive drifting together will pass\r\nover into a phase of more or less conscious and intentional\r\norganization. The segregating groups will develop fashions of costume,\r\ntypes of manners and bearing, and even, perhaps, be characterized by a\r\ncertain type of facial expression. And this gives us a glimpse, an\r\naspect of the immediate future of literature. The kingdoms of the past\r\nwere little things, and above the mass of peasants who lived and obeyed\r\nand died, there was just one little culture to which all must needs\r\nconform. Literature was universal within the limits of its language.\r\nWhere differences of view arose there were violent controversies,\r\npolemics, and persecutions, until one or other rendering had won its\r\nascendency. But this new world into which we are passing will, for\r\nseveral generations at least, albeit it will be freely\r\ninter-communicating and like a whispering gallery for things outspoken,\r\npossess no universal ideals, no universal conventions: there will be the\r\nliterature of the thought and effort of this sort of people, and the\r\nliterature, thought, and effort of that.[32] Life is already most\r\nwonderfully arbitrary and experimental, and for the coming century this\r\nmust be its essential social history, a great drifting and unrest of\r\npeople, a shifting and regrouping and breaking up again of groups, great\r\nmultitudes seeking to find themselves.\r\n\r\nThe safe life in the old order, where one did this because it was right,\r\nand that because it was the custom, when one shunned this and hated\r\nthat, as lead runs into a mould, all that is passing away. And\r\npresently, as the new century opens out, there will become more and more\r\ndistinctly emergent many new cultures and settled ways. The grey expanse\r\nof life to-day is grey, not in its essence, but because of the minute\r\nconfused mingling and mutual cancelling of many-coloured lives.\r\nPresently these tints and shades will gather together here as a mass of\r\none colour, and there as a mass of another. And as these colours\r\nintensify and the tradition of the former order fades, as these cultures\r\nbecome more and more shaped and conscious, as the new literatures grow\r\nin substance and power, as differences develop from speculative matter\r\nof opinion to definite intentions, as contrasts and affinities grow\r\nsharper and clearer, there must follow some very extensive modifications\r\nin the collective public life. But one series of tints, one colour must\r\nneeds have a heightening value amidst this iridescent display. While the\r\nforces at work in the wealthy and purely speculative groups of society\r\nmake for disintegration, and in many cases for positive elimination, the\r\nforces that bring together the really functional people will tend more\r\nand more to impose upon them certain common characteristics and beliefs,\r\nand the discovery of a group of similar and compatible class interests\r\nupon which they can unite. The practical people, the engineering and\r\nmedical and scientific people, will become more and more homogeneous in\r\ntheir fundamental culture, more and more distinctly aware of a common\r\n\"general reason\" in things, and of a common difference from the less\r\nfunctional masses and from any sort of people in the past. They will\r\nhave in their positive science a common ground for understanding the\r\nreal pride of life, the real reason for the incidental nastiness of\r\nvice, and so they will be a sanely reproductive class, and, above all,\r\nan educating class. Just how much they will have kept or changed of the\r\ndeliquescent morality of to-day, when in a hundred years or so they do\r\ndistinctively and powerfully emerge, I cannot speculate now. They will\r\ncertainly be a moral people. They will have developed the literature of\r\ntheir needs, they will have discussed and tested and thrashed out many\r\nthings, they will be clear where we are confused, resolved where we are\r\nundecided and weak. In the districts of industrial possibility, in the\r\nhealthier quarters of the town regions, away from the swamps and away\r\nfrom the glare of the midnight lights, these people will be gathered\r\ntogether. They will be linked in professions through the agency of great\r\nand sober papers--in England the _Lancet_, the _British Medical\r\nJournal_, and the already great periodicals of the engineering trades,\r\nforeshadow something, but only a very little, of what these papers may\r\nbe. The best of the wealthy will gravitate to their attracting\r\ncentres.... Unless some great catastrophe in nature break down all that\r\nman has built, these great kindred groups of capable men and educated,\r\nadequate women must be, under the operation of the forces we have\r\nconsidered so far, the element finally emergent amidst the vast\r\nconfusions of the coming time.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] That interesting book by Mr. George Sutherland, _Twentieth Century\r\nInventions_, is very suggestive on these as on many other matters.\r\n\r\n[31] I use the word \"segregation\" here and always as it is used by\r\nmineralogists to express the slow conveyance of diffused matter upon\r\ncentres of aggregation, such a process as, for example, must have\r\noccurred in the growth of flints.\r\n\r\n[32] Already this is becoming apparent enough. The literary \"Boom,\" for\r\nexample, affected the entire reading public of the early nineteenth\r\ncentury. It was no figure of speech that \"everyone\" was reading Byron or\r\npuzzling about the Waverley mystery, that first and most successful use\r\nof the unknown author dodge. The booming of Dickens, too, forced him\r\neven into the reluctant hands of Omar's Fitzgerald. But the\r\nfactory-syren voice of the modern \"boomster\" touches whole sections of\r\nthe reading public no more than fog-horns going down Channel. One would\r\nas soon think of Skinner's Soap for one's library as So-and-so's Hundred\r\nThousand Copy Success. Instead of \"everyone\" talking of the Great New\r\nBook, quite considerable numbers are shamelessly admitting they don't\r\nread that sort of thing. One gets used to literary booms just as one\r\ngets used to motor cars, they are no longer marvellous, universally\r\nsignificant things, but merely something that goes by with much\r\nunnecessary noise and leaves a faint offence in the air. Distinctly we\r\nsegregate. And while no one dominates, while for all this bawling there\r\nare really no great authors of imperial dimensions, indeed no great\r\nsuccesses to compare with the Waverley boom, or the boom of Macaulay's\r\nHistory, many men, too fine, too subtle, too aberrant, too unusually\r\nfresh for any but exceptional readers, men who would probably have\r\nfailed to get a hearing at all in the past, can now subsist quite\r\nhappily with the little sect they have found, or that has found them.\r\nThey live safely in their islands; a little while ago they could not\r\nhave lived at all, or could have lived only on the shameful bread of\r\npatronage, and yet it is these very men who are often most covetously\r\nbitter against the vulgar preferences of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE-HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding four chapters there has been developed, in a clumsy\r\nlaborious way, a smudgy, imperfect picture of the generalized civilized\r\nstate of the coming century. In terms, vague enough at times, but never\r\nabsolutely indefinite, the general distribution of the population in\r\nthis state has been discussed, and its natural development into four\r\ngreat--but in practice intimately interfused--classes. It has been\r\nshown--I know not how convincingly--that as the result of forces that\r\nare practically irresistible, a world-wide process of social and moral\r\ndeliquescence is in progress, and that a really functional social body\r\nof engineering, managing men, scientifically trained, and having common\r\nideals and interests, is likely to segregate and disentangle itself from\r\nour present confusion of aimless and ill-directed lives. It has been\r\npointed out that life is presenting an unprecedented and increasing\r\nvariety of morals, _ménages_, occupations and types, at present so\r\nmingled as to give a general effect of greyness, but containing the\r\npromise of local concentration that may presently change that greyness\r\ninto kaleidoscopic effects. That image of concentrating contrasted\r\ncolours will be greatly repeated in this present chapter. In the course\r\nof these inquiries, we have permitted ourselves to take a few concrete\r\nglimpses of households, costumes, conveyances, and conveniences of the\r\ncoming time, but only as incidental realizations of points in this\r\ngeneral thesis. And now, assuming, as we must necessarily do, the\r\nsoundness of these earlier speculations, we have arrived at a stage when\r\nwe may consider how the existing arrangements for the ostensible\r\ngovernment of the State are likely to develop through their own inherent\r\nforces, and how they are likely to be affected by the processes we have\r\nforecast.\r\n\r\nSo far, this has been a speculation upon the probable development of a\r\ncivilized society _in vacuo_. Attention has been almost exclusively\r\ngiven to the forces of development, and not to the forces of conflict\r\nand restraint. We have ignored the boundaries of language that are flung\r\nathwart the great lines of modern communication, we have disregarded the\r\nfriction of tariffs, the peculiar groups of prejudices and irrational\r\ninstincts that inspire one miscellany of shareholders, workers,\r\nfinanciers, and superfluous poor such as the English, to hate,\r\nexasperate, lie about, and injure another such miscellany as the French\r\nor the Germans. Moreover, we have taken very little account of the fact\r\nthat, quite apart from nationality, each individual case of the new\r\nsocial order is developing within the form of a legal government based\r\non conceptions of a society that has been superseded by the advent of\r\nmechanism. It is this last matter that we are about to take into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nNow, this age is being constantly described as a \"Democratic\" age;\r\n\"Democracy\" is alleged to have affected art, literature, trade and\r\nreligion alike in the most remarkable ways. It is not only tacitly\r\npresent in the great bulk of contemporary thought that this \"Democracy\"\r\nis now dominant, but that it is becoming more and more overwhelmingly\r\npredominant as the years pass. Allusions to Democracy are so abundant,\r\ndeductions from its influence so confident and universal, that it is\r\nworth while to point out what a very hollow thing the word in most cases\r\nreally is, a large empty object in thought, of the most vague and faded\r\nassociations and the most attenuated content, and to inquire just\r\nexactly what the original implications and present realities of\r\n\"Democracy\" may be. The inquiry will leave us with a very different\r\nconception of the nature and future of this sort of political\r\narrangement from that generally assumed. We have already seen in the\r\ndiscussion of the growth of great cities, that an analytical process may\r\nabsolutely invert the expectation based on the gross results up-to-date,\r\nand I believe it will be equally possible to show cause for believing\r\nthat the development of Democracy also is, after all, not the opening\r\nphase of a world-wide movement going on unbendingly in its present\r\ndirection, but the first impulse of forces that will finally sweep round\r\ninto a quite different path. Flying off at a tangent is probably one of\r\nthe gravest dangers and certainly the one most constantly present, in\r\nthis enterprise of prophecy.\r\n\r\nOne may, I suppose, take the Rights of Man as they are embodied in the\r\nFrench Declaration as the ostentations of Democracy; our present\r\nDemocratic state may be regarded as a practical realization of these\r\nclaims. As far as the individual goes, the realization takes the form of\r\nan untrammelled liberty in matters that have heretofore been considered\r\na part of social procedure, in the lifting of positive religious and\r\nmoral compulsions, in the recognition of absolute property, and in the\r\nabolition of special privileges and special restrictions. Politically\r\nmodern Democracy takes the form of denying that any specific person or\r\npersons shall act as a matter of intrinsic right or capacity on behalf\r\nof the community as a whole. Its root idea is representation. Government\r\nis based primarily on election, and every ruler is, in theory at least,\r\na delegate and servant of the popular will. It is implicit in the\r\nDemocratic theory that there _is_ such a thing as a popular will, and\r\nthis is supposed to be the net sum of the wills of all the citizens in\r\nthe State, so far as public affairs are concerned. In its less perfect\r\nand more usual state the Democratic theory is advanced either as an\r\nethical theory which postulates an absence of formal acquiescence on the\r\npart of the governed as injustice, or else as a convenient political\r\ncompromise, the least objectionable of all possible methods of public\r\ncontrol, because it will permit only the minimum of general\r\nunhappiness.... I know of no case for the elective Democratic government\r\nof modern States that cannot be knocked to pieces in five minutes. It is\r\nmanifest that upon countless important public issues there is no\r\ncollective will, and nothing in the mind of the average man except blank\r\nindifference; that an electional system simply places power in the hands\r\nof the most skilful electioneers; that neither men nor their rights are\r\nidentically equal, but vary with every individual, and, above all, that\r\nthe minimum or maximum of general happiness is related only so\r\nindirectly to the public control that people will suffer great miseries\r\nfrom their governments unresistingly, and, on the other hand, change\r\ntheir rulers on account of the most trivial irritations. The case\r\nagainst all the prolusions of ostensible Democracy is indeed so strong\r\nthat it is impossible to consider the present wide establishment of\r\nDemocratic institutions as being the outcome of any process of\r\nintellectual conviction; it arouses suspicion even whether ostensible\r\nDemocracy may not be a mere rhetorical garment for essentially\r\ndifferent facts, and upon that suspicion we will now inquire.\r\n\r\nDemocracy of the modern type, manhood suffrage and so forth, became a\r\nconspicuous phenomenon in the world only in the closing decades of the\r\neighteenth century. Its genesis is so intimately connected with the\r\nfirst expansion of the productive element in the State, through\r\nmechanism and a co-operative organization, as to point at once to a\r\ncausative connection. The more closely one looks into the social and\r\npolitical life of the eighteenth century the more plausible becomes this\r\nview. New and potentially influential social factors had begun to\r\nappear--the organizing manufacturer, the intelligent worker, the skilled\r\ntenant, and the urban abyss, and the traditions of the old land-owning\r\nnon-progressive aristocratic monarchy that prevailed in Christendom,\r\nrendered it incapable--without some destructive shock or convulsion--of\r\nany re-organization to incorporate or control these new factors. In the\r\ncase of the British Empire an additional stress was created by the\r\nincapacity of the formal government to assimilate the developing\r\ncivilization of the American colonies. Everywhere there were new\r\nelements, not as yet clearly analyzed or defined, arising as mechanism\r\narose; everywhere the old traditional government and social system,\r\ndefined and analyzed all too well, appeared increasingly obstructive,\r\nirrational, and feeble in its attempts to include and direct these new\r\npowers. But now comes a point to which I am inclined to attach very\r\ngreat importance. The new powers were as yet shapeless. It was not the\r\nconflict of a new organization with the old. It was the preliminary\r\ndwarfing and deliquescence of the mature old beside the embryonic mass\r\nof the new. It was impossible then--it is, I believe, only beginning to\r\nbe possible now--to estimate the proportions, possibilities, and\r\ninter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social\r\norganization has still to be built in the coming years. No formula of\r\ndefinite re-construction had been evolved, or has even been evolved yet,\r\nafter a hundred years. And these swelling inchoate new powers, whose\r\nvery birth condition was the crippling, modification, or destruction of\r\nthe old order, were almost forced to formulate their proceedings for a\r\ntime, therefore, in general affirmative propositions that were really in\r\neffect not affirmative propositions at all, but propositions of\r\nrepudiation and denial. \"These kings and nobles and people privileged in\r\nrelation to obsolescent functions cannot manage our affairs\"--that was\r\nevident enough, that was the really essential question at that time, and\r\nsince no other effectual substitute appeared ready made, the working\r\ndoctrine of the infallible judgment of humanity in the gross, as\r\ndistinguished from the quite indisputable incapacity of sample\r\nindividuals, became, in spite of its inherent absurdity, a convenient\r\nand acceptable working hypothesis.\r\n\r\nModern Democracy thus came into being, not, as eloquent persons have\r\npretended, by the sovereign people consciously and definitely assuming\r\npower--I imagine the sovereign people in France during the first\r\nRevolution, for example, quite amazed and muddle-headed with it all--but\r\nby the decline of old ruling classes in the face of the _quasi_-natural\r\ngrowth of mechanism and industrialism, and by the unpreparedness and\r\nwant of organization in the new intelligent elements in the State. I\r\nhave compared the human beings in society to a great and increasing\r\nvariety of colours tumultuously smashed up together, and giving at\r\npresent a general and quite illusory effect of grey, and I have\r\nattempted to show that there is a process in progress that will amount\r\nat last to the segregation of these mingled tints into recognizable\r\ndistinct masses again. It is not a monotony, but an utterly disorderly\r\nand confusing variety that makes this grey, but Democracy, for practical\r\npurposes, does really assume such a monotony. Like 'infinity', the\r\nDemocratic formula is a concrete-looking and negotiable symbol for a\r\nnegation. It is the aspect in political disputes and contrivances of\r\nthat social and moral deliquescence the nature and possibilities of\r\nwhich have been discussed in the preceding chapters of this volume.\r\n\r\nModern Democracy first asserted itself in the ancient kingdoms of\r\nFrance and Great Britain (counting the former British colonies in\r\nAmerica as a part of the latter), and it is in the French and\r\nEnglish-speaking communities that Democracy has developed itself most\r\ncompletely. Upon the supposition we have made, Democracy broke out first\r\nin these States because they were leading the way in material progress,\r\nbecause they were the first States to develop industrialism, wholesale\r\nmechanisms, and great masses of insubordinate activity outside the\r\nrecognized political scheme, and the nature and time and violence of the\r\noutbreak was determined by the nature of the superseded government, and\r\nthe amount of stress between it and the new elements. But the detachment\r\nof a great section of the new middle-class from the aristocratic order\r\nof England to form the United States of America, and the sudden\r\nrejuvenescence of France by the swift and thorough sloughing of its\r\noutworn aristocratic monarchy, the consequent wars and the Napoleonic\r\nadventure, checked and modified the parallel development that might\r\notherwise have happened in country after country over all Europe west of\r\nthe Carpathians. The monarchies that would probably have collapsed\r\nthrough internal forces and given place to modern democratic states were\r\nsmashed from the outside, and a process of political re-construction,\r\nthat has probably missed out the complete formal Democratic phase\r\naltogether--and which has been enormously complicated through\r\nreligious, national, and dynastic traditions--set in. Throughout\r\nAmerica, in England, and, after extraordinary experiments, in France,\r\npolitical democracy has in effect legally established itself--most\r\ncompletely in the United States--and the reflection and influence of its\r\nmethods upon the methods of all the other countries in intellectual\r\ncontact with it, have been so considerable as practically to make their\r\nmonarchies as new in their kind, almost, as democratic republics. In\r\nGermany, Austria, and Italy, for example, there is a press nearly as\r\naudible as in the more frankly democratic countries, and measurably akin\r\nin influence; there are constitutionally established legislative\r\nassemblies, and there is the same unofficial development of powerful\r\nfinancial and industrial powers with which the ostensible Government\r\nmust make terms. In a vast amount of the public discussion of these\r\nStates, the postulates of Democracy are clearly implicit. Quite as much\r\nin reality as the democratic republics of America, are they based not on\r\nclasses but upon a confusion; they are, in their various degrees and\r\nwith their various individual differences, just as truly governments of\r\nthe grey.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that the grey is illusory and must sooner or later\r\npass, and that the colour that will emerge to predominance will take its\r\nshape as a scientifically trained middle-class of an unprecedented\r\nsort, not arising out of the older middle-classes, but replacing them.\r\nThis class will become, I believe, at last consciously _the_ State,\r\ncontrolling and restricting very greatly the three non-functional masses\r\nwith which it is as yet almost indistinguishably mingled. The general\r\nnature of its formation within the existing confusion and its emergence\r\nmay, I think, with a certain degree of confidence, be already forecast,\r\nalbeit at present its beginnings are singularly unpromising and faint.\r\nAt present the class of specially trained and capable people--doctors,\r\nengineers, scientific men of all sorts--is quite disproportionally\r\nabsent from political life, it does not exist as a factor in that life,\r\nit is growing up outside that life, and has still to develop, much more\r\nto display, a collective intention to come specifically in. But the\r\nforces are in active operation to drag it into the centre of the stage\r\nfor all that.\r\n\r\nThe modern democracy or democratic quasi-monarchy conducts its affairs\r\nas though there was no such thing as special knowledge or practical\r\neducation. The utmost recognition it affords to the man who has taken\r\nthe pains to know, and specifically to do, is occasionally to consult\r\nhim upon specific points and override his counsels in its ampler wisdom,\r\nor to entrust to him some otherwise impossible duty under circumstances\r\nof extreme limitation. The man of special equipment is treated always as\r\nif he were some sort of curious performing animal. The gunnery\r\nspecialist, for example, may move and let off guns, but he may not say\r\nwhere they are to be let off--some one a little ignorant of range and\r\ntrajectory does that; the engineer may move the ship and fire the\r\nbattery, but only with some man, who does not perfectly understand,\r\nshouting instructions down a tube at him. If the cycle is to be adapted\r\nto military requirements, the thing is entrusted to Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBalfour. If horses are to be bought for the British Army in India, no\r\nspecialist goes, but Lord Edward Cecil. These people of the governing\r\nclass do not understand there is such a thing as special knowledge or an\r\ninexorable fact in the world; they have been educated at schools\r\nconducted by amateur schoolmasters, whose real aim in life--if such\r\npeople can be described as having a real aim in life--is the episcopal\r\nbench, and they have learnt little or nothing but the extraordinary\r\npower of appearances in these democratic times. To look right and to be\r\nof good report is to succeed. What else is there? The primarily\r\nfunctional men are ignored in the ostensible political scheme, it\r\noperates as though they did not exist, as though nothing, in fact,\r\nexisted but the irresponsible wealthy, and the manipulators of\r\nirresponsible wealth, on the one hand, and a great, grey, politically\r\nindifferent community on the other. Having regard only to the present\r\ncondition of political life, it would seem as though this state of\r\naffairs must continue indefinitely, and develop only in accordance with\r\nthe laws of inter-action between our charlatan governing class on the\r\none hand, and the grey mass of governed on the other. There is no way\r\napparent in the existing political and social order, whereby the class\r\nof really educated persons that the continually more complicated\r\nmechanical fabric of social life is developing may be expected to come\r\nin. And in a very great amount of current political speculation, the\r\ndevelopment and final emergence of this class is ignored, and attention\r\nis concentrated entirely upon the inherent process of development of the\r\npolitical machine. And even in that it is very easy to exaggerate the\r\npreponderance of one or other of what are really very evenly balanced\r\nforces in the machine of democratic government.\r\n\r\nThere are two chief sets of parts in the machine that have a certain\r\nantagonistic relation, that play against each other, and one's\r\nconception of coming developments is necessarily determined by the\r\nrelative value one gives to these opposing elements. One may compare\r\nthese two groups to the Power and the Work, respectively, at the two\r\nends of a lever.[33] On the one hand there is that which pays for the\r\nmachine, which distributes salaries and rewards, subsidizes newspapers\r\nand so forth--the central influence.[34] On the other hand, there is\r\nthe collectively grey voting mass, with certain prejudices and\r\ntraditions, and certain laws and limitations of thought upon which the\r\nnewspapers work, and which, within the confines of its inherent laws,\r\nthey direct. If one dwell chiefly on the possibilities of the former\r\nelement, one may conjure up a practical end to democracy in the vision\r\nof a State \"run\" entirely by a group of highly forcible and intellectual\r\npersons--usually the dream takes the shape of financiers and their\r\nassociates, their perfected mechanism of party control working the\r\nelections boldly and capably, and their public policy being directed\r\ntowards financial ends. One of the common prophecies of the future of\r\nthe United States is such a domination by a group of trust organizers\r\nand political bosses. But a man, or a group of men, so strong and\r\nintelligent as would be needed to hold an entire party machine within\r\nthe confines of his--or their collective--mind and will, could, at the\r\nmost, be but a very transitory and incidental phenomenon in the history\r\nof the world. Either such an exploitation of the central control will\r\nhave to be covert and subtle beyond any precedent in human\r\ndisingenuousness, or else its domination will have to be very amply\r\nmodified indeed, by the requirements of the second factor, and its\r\nproceedings made very largely the resultant of that second factor's\r\nforces. Moreover, very subtle men do not aim at things of this sort, or\r\naiming, fail, because subtlety of intelligence involves subtlety of\r\ncharacter, a certain fastidiousness and a certain weakness. Now that the\r\ngarrulous period, when a flow of language and a certain effectiveness of\r\nmanner was a necessary condition to political pre-eminence, is passing\r\naway, political control falls more and more entirely into the hands of a\r\nbarristerish intriguing sort of person with a tough-wearing, leathery,\r\npractical mind. The sort of people who will work the machine are people\r\nwith \"faith,\" as the popular preachers say, meaning, in fact, people who\r\ndo not analyze, people who will take the machine as it is,\r\nunquestioningly, shape their ambitions to it, and--saving their\r\nvanity--work it as it wants to go. The man who will be boss will be the\r\nman who wants to be boss, who finds, in being boss, a complete and final\r\nsatisfaction, and not the man who complicates things by wanting to be\r\nboss in order to be, or do, something else. The machines are governed\r\nto-day, and there is every reason to believe that they will continue to\r\nbe governed, by masterful-looking resultants, masters of nothing but\r\ncompromise, and that little fancy of an inner conspiracy of control\r\nwithin the machine and behind ostensible politics is really on all fours\r\nwith the wonderful Rodin (of the Juif Errant) and as probable as\r\nanything else in the romances of Eugene Sue.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we direct attention to the antagonistic element\r\nin the machine, to Public Opinion, to the alleged collective mind of the\r\ngrey mass, and consider how it is brought to believe in itself and its\r\npossession of certain opinions by the concrete evidence of daily\r\nnewspapers and eloquent persons saying as much, we may also very readily\r\nconjure up a contrasted vision of extraordinary demagogues or newspaper\r\nsyndicates working the political machine from that direction. So far as\r\nthe demagogue goes, the increase of population, the multiplication of\r\namusements and interests, the differentiation of social habits, the\r\ndiffusion of great towns, all militate against that sufficient gathering\r\nof masses of voters in meeting-houses which gave him his power in the\r\nrecent past. It is improbable that ever again will any flushed\r\nundignified man with a vast voice, a muscular face in incessant\r\noperation, collar crumpled, hair disordered, and arms in wild activity,\r\ntalking, talking, talking, talking copiously out of the windows of\r\nrailway carriages, talking on railway platforms, talking from hotel\r\nbalconies, talking on tubs, barrels, scaffoldings, pulpits--tireless and\r\nundammable--rise to be the most powerful thing in any democratic state\r\nin the world. Continually the individual vocal demagogue dwindles, and\r\nthe element of bands and buttons, the organization of the press and\r\nprocession, the share of the machine, grows.\r\n\r\nMr. Harmsworth, of the London _Daily Mail_, in a very interesting\r\narticle has glanced at certain possibilities of power that may vest in\r\nthe owners of a great system of world-wide \"simultaneous\" newspapers,\r\nbut he does not analyze the nature of the influence exercised by\r\nnewspapers during the successive phases of the nineteenth century, nor\r\nthe probable modifications of that influence in the years to come, and I\r\nthink, on the whole, he inclines very naturally to over estimate the\r\namount of intentional direction that may be given by the owner of a\r\npaper to the minds and acts of his readers, and to exceed the very\r\ndefinite limits within which that influence is confined. In the earlier\r\nVictorian period, the more limited, partly educated, and still very\r\nhomogeneous enfranchised class, had a certain habit of thinking; its\r\ntranquil assurance upon most theological and all moral and æsthetic\r\npoints left political questions as the chief field of exercise for such\r\nthinking as it did, and, as a consequence, the dignified newspapers of\r\nthat time were able to discuss, and indeed were required to discuss not\r\nonly specific situations but general principles. That indeed was their\r\nprincipal function, and it fell rather to the eloquent men to misapply\r\nthese principles according to the necessity of the occasion. The papers\r\ndid then very much more than they do now to mould opinion, though they\r\ndid not direct affairs to anything like the extent of their modern\r\nsuccessors. They made roads upon which events presently travelled in\r\nunexpected fashions. But the often cheaper and always more vivid\r\nnewspapers that have come with the New Democracy do nothing to mould\r\nopinion. Indeed, there is no longer upon most public questions--and as I\r\nhave tried to make clear in my previous paper, there is not likely to be\r\nany longer--a collective opinion to be moulded. Protectionists, for\r\nexample, are a mere band, Free Traders are a mere band; on all these\r\ndetails we are in chaos. And these modern newspapers simply endeavour to\r\nsustain a large circulation and so merit advertisements by being as\r\nmiscellaneously and vividly interesting as possible, by firing where the\r\ncrowd seems thickest, by seeking perpetually and without any attempt at\r\nconsistency, the greatest excitement of the greatest number. It is upon\r\nthe cultivation and rapid succession of inflammatory topics that the\r\nmodern newspaper expends its capital and trusts to recover its reward.\r\nIts general news sinks steadily to a subordinate position; criticism,\r\ndiscussion, and high responsibility pass out of journalism, and the\r\npower of the press comes more and more to be a dramatic and emotional\r\npower, the power to cry \"Fire!\" in the theatre, the power to give\r\nenormous value for a limited time to some personality, some event, some\r\naspect, true or false, without any power of giving a specific direction\r\nto the forces this distortion may set going. Directly the press of\r\nto-day passes from that sort of thing to some specific proposal, some\r\nimplication of principles and beliefs, directly it chooses and selects,\r\nthen it passes from the miscellaneous to the sectarian, and out of touch\r\nwith the grey indefiniteness of the general mind. It gives offence here,\r\nit perplexes and bores there; no more than the boss politician can the\r\npaper of great circulation afford to work consistently for any ulterior\r\naim.\r\n\r\nThis is the limit of the power of the modern newspaper of large\r\ncirculation, the newspaper that appeals to the grey element, to the\r\naverage democratic man, the newspaper of the deliquescence, and if our\r\nprevious conclusion that human society has ceased to be homogeneous and\r\nwill presently display new masses segregating from a great confusion,\r\nholds good, that will be the limit of its power in the future. It may\r\nundergo many remarkable developments and modifications,[35] but none of\r\nthese tend to give it any greater political importance than it has now.\r\nAnd so, after all, our considerations of the probable developments of\r\nthe party machine give us only negative results, so long as the grey\r\nsocial confusion continues. Subject to that continuance the party\r\nmachine will probably continue as it is at present, and Democratic\r\nStates and governments follow the lines upon which they run at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nNow, how will the emergent class of capable men presently begin to\r\nmodify the existing form of government in the ostensibly democratic\r\ncountries and democratic monarchies? There will be very many variations\r\nand modifications of the methods of this arrival, an infinite\r\ncomplication of detailed incidents, but a general proposition will be\r\nfound to hold good. The suppression of the party machine in the purely\r\ndemocratic countries and of the official choice of the rich and\r\nprivileged rulers in the more monarchical ones, by capable operative and\r\nadministrative men inspired by the belief in a common theory of social\r\norder, will come about--peacefully and gradually as a process of change,\r\nor violently as a revolution--but inevitably as the outcome either of\r\nthe imminence or else of the disasters of war.\r\n\r\nThat all these governments of confusion will drift towards war, with a\r\nspacious impulse and a final vehemence quite out of comparison greater\r\nthan the warlike impulses of former times, is a remarkable but by no\r\nmeans inexplicable thing. A tone of public expression, jealous and\r\npatriotic to the danger-point, is an unavoidable condition under which\r\ndemocratic governments exist. To be patriotically quarrelsome is\r\nimperative upon the party machines that will come to dominate the\r\ndemocratic countries. They will not possess detailed and definite\r\npolicies and creeds because there are no longer any detailed and\r\ndefinite public opinions, but they will for all that require some\r\nostensible purpose to explain their cohesion, some hold upon the common\r\nman that will ensure his appearance in numbers at the polling place\r\nsufficient to save the government from the raids of small but determined\r\nsects. That hold can be only of one sort. Without moral or religious\r\nuniformity, with material interests as involved and confused as a heap\r\nof spelicans, there remains only one generality for the politician's\r\npurpose, the ampler aspect of a man's egotism, his pride in what he\r\nimagines to be his particular kind--his patriotism. In every country\r\namenable to democratic influences there emerges, or will emerge, a party\r\nmachine, vividly and simply patriotic--and indefinite upon the score of\r\nany other possible consideration between man and man. This will hold\r\ntrue, not only of the ostensibly democratic states, but also of such\r\nreconstituted modern monarchies as Italy and Germany, for they, too, for\r\nall their legal difference, rest also on the grey. The party conflicts\r\nof the future will turn very largely on the discovery of the true\r\npatriot, on the suspicion that the crown or the machine in possession is\r\nin some more or less occult way traitorous, and almost all other matters\r\nof contention will be shelved and allowed to stagnate, for fear of\r\nbreaking the unity of the national mechanism.\r\n\r\nNow, patriotism is not a thing that flourishes in the void,--one needs a\r\nforeigner. A national and patriotic party is an anti-foreign party; the\r\naltar of the modern god, Democracy, will cry aloud for the stranger men.\r\nSimply to keep in power, and out of no love of mischief, the government\r\nor the party machine will have to insist upon dangers and national\r\ndifferences, to keep the voter to the poll by alarms, seeking ever to\r\ntaint the possible nucleus of any competing organization with the\r\nscandal of external influence. The party press will play the watch-dog\r\nand allay all internal dissensions with its warning bay at some adjacent\r\npeople, and the adjacent peoples, for reasons to be presently expanded,\r\nwill be continually more sensitive to such baying. Already one sees\r\ncountry yelping at country all over the modern world, not only in the\r\nmatter of warlike issues, but with a note of quite furious commercial\r\nrivalry--quite furious and, indeed, quite insane, since its ideal of\r\ntrading enormously with absolutely ruined and tradeless foreigners,\r\nexporting everything and importing nothing, is obviously outside reason\r\naltogether. The inexorable doom of these governments based on the grey,\r\nis to foster enmity between people and people. Even their alliances are\r\nbut sacrifices to intenser antagonisms. And the phases of the democratic\r\nsequence are simple and sure. Forced on by a relentless competition, the\r\ntone of the outcries will become fiercer and fiercer; the occasions of\r\nexcitement, the perilous moments, the ingenuities of annoyance, more and\r\nmore dramatic,--from the mere emptiness and disorder of the general\r\nmind! Jealousies and anti-foreign enactments, tariff manipulations and\r\ncommercial embitterment, destructive, foolish, exasperating obstructions\r\nthat benefit no human being, will minister to this craving without\r\ncompletely allaying it. Nearer, and ever nearer, the politicians of the\r\ncoming times will force one another towards the verge, not because they\r\nwant to go over it, not because any one wants to go over it, but because\r\nthey are, by their very nature, compelled to go that way, because to go\r\nin any other direction is to break up and lose power. And, consequently,\r\nthe final development of the democratic system, so far as intrinsic\r\nforces go, will be, not the rule of the boss, nor the rule of the trust,\r\nnor the rule of the newspaper; no rule, indeed, but international\r\nrivalry, international competition, international exasperation and\r\nhostility, and at last--irresistible and overwhelming--the definite\r\nestablishment of the rule of that most stern and educational of all\r\nmasters--_War_.\r\n\r\nAt this point there opens a tempting path, and along it historical\r\nprecedents, like a forest of notice-boards, urge us to go. At the end of\r\nthe vista poses the figure of Napoleon with \"Cæsarism\" written beneath\r\nit. Disregarding certain alien considerations for a time, assuming the\r\nfree working out of democracy to its conclusion, we perceive that, in\r\nthe case of our generalized state, the party machine, together with the\r\nnation entrusted to it, must necessarily be forced into passionate\r\nnational war. But, having blundered into war, the party machine will\r\nhave an air of having accomplished its destiny. A party machine or a\r\npopular government is surely as likely a thing to cause a big disorder\r\nof war and as unlikely a thing to conduct it, as the wit of man, working\r\nsolely to that end, could ever have devised. I have already pointed out\r\nwhy we can never expect an elected government of the modern sort to be\r\nguided by any far-reaching designs, it is constructed to get office and\r\nkeep office, not to do anything in office, the conditions of its\r\nsurvival are to keep appearances up and taxes down,[36] and the care\r\nand management of army and navy is quite outside its possibilities. The\r\nmilitary and naval professions in our typical modern State will subsist\r\nvery largely upon tradition, the ostensible government will interfere\r\nwith rather than direct them, and there will be no force in the entire\r\nscheme to check the corrupting influence of a long peace, to insist upon\r\nadequate exercises for the fighting organization or ensure an adequate\r\nadaptation to the new and perpetually changing possibilities of untried\r\napparatus. Incapable but confident and energetic persons, having\r\npolitical influence, will have been permitted to tamper with the various\r\narms of the service, the equipment will be largely devised to create an\r\nimpression of efficiency in times of peace in the minds of the general\r\nvoting public, and the really efficient soldiers will either have\r\nfretted themselves out of the army or have been driven out as political\r\nnon-effectives, troublesome, innovating persons anxious to spend money\r\nupon \"fads.\" So armed, the New Democracy will blunder into war, and the\r\nopening stage of the next great war will be the catastrophic breakdown\r\nof the formal armies, shame and disasters, and a disorder of conflict\r\nbetween more or less equally matched masses of stupefied, scared, and\r\ninfuriated people. Just how far the thing may rise from the value of an\r\nalarming and edifying incident to a universal catastrophe, depends upon\r\nthe special nature of the conflict, but it does not alter the fact that\r\nany considerable war is bound to be a bitter, appalling, highly\r\neducational and constitution-shaking experience for the modern\r\ndemocratic state.\r\n\r\nNow, foreseeing this possibility, it is easy to step into the trap of\r\nthe Napoleonic precedent. One hastens to foretell that either with the\r\npressure of coming war, or in the hour of defeat, there will arise the\r\nMan. He will be strong in action, epigrammatic in manner, personally\r\nhandsome and continually victorious. He will sweep aside parliaments and\r\ndemagogues, carry the nation to glory, reconstruct it as an empire, and\r\nhold it together by circulating his profile and organizing further\r\nsuccesses. He will--I gather this from chance lights upon contemporary\r\nanticipations--codify everything, rejuvenate the papacy, or, at any\r\nrate, galvanize Christianity, organize learning in meek intriguing\r\nacademies of little men, and prescribe a wonderful educational system.\r\nThe grateful nations will once more deify a lucky and aggressive\r\negotism.... And there the vision loses breath.\r\n\r\nNothing of the sort is going to happen, or, at any rate, if it happens,\r\nit will happen as an interlude, as no necessary part in the general\r\nprogress of the human drama. The world is no more to be recast by chance\r\nindividuals than a city is to be lit by sky rockets. The purpose of\r\nthings emerges upon spacious issues, and the day of individual leaders\r\nis past. The analogies and precedents that lead one to forecast the\r\ncoming of military one-man-dominions, the coming of such other parodies\r\nof Cæsar's career as that misapplied, and speedily futile chess\r\nchampion, Napoleon I. contrived, are false. They are false because they\r\nignore two correlated things; first, the steady development of a new and\r\nquite unprecedented educated class as a necessary aspect of the\r\nexpansion of science and mechanism, and secondly, the absolute\r\nrevolution in the art of war that science and mechanism are bringing\r\nabout. This latter consideration the next chapter will expand, but here,\r\nin the interests of this discussion, we may in general terms anticipate\r\nits gist. War in the past has been a thing entirely different in its\r\nnature from what war, with the apparatus of the future, will be--it has\r\nbeen showy, dramatic, emotional, and restricted; war in the future will\r\nbe none of these things. War in the past was a thing of days and\r\nheroisms; battles and campaigns rested in the hand of the great\r\ncommander, he stood out against the sky, picturesquely on horseback,\r\nvisibly controlling it all. War in the future will be a question of\r\npreparation, of long years of foresight and disciplined imagination,\r\nthere will be no decisive victory, but a vast diffusion of conflict--it\r\nwill depend less and less on controlling personalities and driving\r\nemotions, and more and more upon the intelligence and personal quality\r\nof a great number of skilled men. All this the next chapter will expand.\r\nAnd either before or after, but, at any rate, in the shadow of war, it\r\nwill become apparent, perhaps even suddenly, that the whole apparatus of\r\npower in the country is in the hands of a new class of intelligent and\r\nscientifically-educated men. They will probably, under the development\r\nof warlike stresses, be discovered--they will discover\r\nthemselves--almost surprisingly with roads and railways, carts and\r\ncities, drains, food supply, electrical supply, and water supply, and\r\nwith guns and such implements of destruction and intimidation as men\r\nscarcely dream of yet, gathered in their hands. And they will be\r\ndiscovered, too, with a growing common consciousness of themselves as\r\ndistinguished from the grey confusion, a common purpose and implication\r\nthat the fearless analysis of science is already bringing to light.\r\nThey will find themselves with bloodshed and horrible disasters ahead,\r\nand the material apparatus of control entirely within their power.\r\n\"Suppose, after all,\" they will say, \"we ignore these very eloquent and\r\nshowy governing persons above, and this very confused and ineffectual\r\nmultitude below. Suppose now we put on the brakes and try something a\r\nlittle more stable and orderly. These people in possession have, of\r\ncourse, all sorts of established rights and prescriptions; they have\r\nsquared the law to their purpose, and the constitution does not know us;\r\nthey can get at the judges, they can get at the newspapers, they can do\r\nall sorts of things except avoid a smash--but, for our part, we have\r\nthese really most ingenious and subtle guns. Suppose instead of our\r\nturning them and our valuable selves in a fool's quarrel against the\r\ningenious and subtle guns of other men akin to ourselves, we use them in\r\nthe cause of the higher sanity, and clear that jabbering war tumult out\r\nof the streets.\"... There may be no dramatic moment for the expression\r\nof this idea, no moment when the new Cromwellism and the new Ironsides\r\nwill come visibly face to face with talk and baubles, flags and\r\npatriotic dinner bells; but, with or without dramatic moments, the idea\r\nwill be expressed and acted upon. It will be made quite evident then,\r\nwhat is now indeed only a pious opinion, namely, that wealth is, after\r\nall, no ultimate Power at all, but only an influence among aimless,\r\npolice-guarded men. So long as there is peace the class of capable men\r\nmay be mitigated and gagged and controlled, and the ostensible present\r\norder may flourish still in the hands of that other class of men which\r\ndeals with the appearances of things. But as some supersaturated\r\nsolution will crystallize out with the mere shaking of its beaker, so\r\nmust the new order of men come into visibly organized existence through\r\nthe concussions of war. The charlatans can escape everything except war,\r\nbut to the cant and violence of nationality, to the sustaining force of\r\ninternational hostility, they are ruthlessly compelled to cling, and\r\nwhat is now their chief support must become at last their destruction.\r\nAnd so it is I infer that, whether violently as a revolution or quietly\r\nand slowly, this grey confusion that is Democracy must pass away\r\ninevitably by its own inherent conditions, as the twilight passes, as\r\nthe embryonic confusion of the cocoon creature passes, into the higher\r\nstage, into the higher organism, the world-state of the coming years.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] The fulcrum, which is generally treated as being absolutely\r\nimmovable, being the general belief in the theory of democracy.\r\n\r\n[34] In the United States, a vast rapidly developing country, with\r\nrelatively much kinetic wealth, this central influence is the financial\r\nsupport of the Boss, consisting for the most part of active-minded,\r\ncapable business organizers; in England, the land where irresponsible\r\nrealized wealth is at a maximum, a public-spirited section of the\r\nirresponsible, inspired by the tradition of an aristocratic functional\r\npast, qualifies the financial influence with an amateurish, indolent,\r\nand publicly unprofitable integrity. In Germany an aggressively\r\nfunctional Court occupies the place and plays the part of a permanently\r\ndominant party machine.\r\n\r\n[35] The nature of these modifications is an interesting side issue.\r\nThere is every possibility of papers becoming at last papers of\r\nworld-wide circulation, so far as the language in which they are printed\r\npermits, with editions that will follow the sun and change into\r\nto-morrow's issue as they go, picking up literary criticism here,\r\nfinancial intelligence there, here to-morrow's story, and there\r\nto-morrow's scandal, and, like some vast intellectual garden-roller,\r\nrolling out local provincialism at every revolution. This, for papers in\r\nEnglish, at any rate, is merely a question of how long it will be before\r\nthe price of the best writing (for journalistic purposes) rises actually\r\nor relatively above the falling cost of long distance electrical type\r\nsetting. Each of the local editions of these world travelling papers, in\r\naddition to the identical matter that will appear almost simultaneously\r\neverywhere, will no doubt have its special matter and its special\r\nadvertisements. Illustrations will be telegraphed just as well as\r\nmatter, and probably a much greater use will be made of sketch and\r\ndiagram than at present. If the theory advanced in this book that\r\ndemocracy is a transitory confusion be sound, there will not be one\r\nworld paper of this sort only--like Moses' serpent after its miraculous\r\nstruggle--but several, and as the non-provincial segregation of society\r\ngoes on, these various great papers will take on more and more decided\r\nspecific characteristics, and lose more and more their local references.\r\nThey will come to have not only a distinctive type of matter, a\r\ndistinctive method of thought and manner of expression, but distinctive\r\nfundamental implications, and a distinctive class of writer. This\r\ndifference in character and tone renders the advent of any Napoleonic\r\nmaster of the newspaper world vastly more improbable than it would\r\notherwise be. These specializing newspapers will, as they find their\r\nclass, throw out many features that do not belong to that class. It is\r\nhighly probable that many will restrict the space devoted to news and\r\nsham news; that forged and inflated stuff made in offices, that bulks\r\nout the foreign intelligence of so many English papers, for example. At\r\npresent every paper contains a little of everything, inadequate sporting\r\nstuff, inadequate financial stuff, vague literary matter, voluminous\r\nreports of political vapourings, because no newspaper is quite sure of\r\nthe sort of readers it has--probably no daily newspaper has yet a\r\ndistinctive sort of reader.\r\n\r\nMany people, with their minds inspired by the number of editions which\r\nevening papers pretend to publish and do not, incline to believe that\r\ndaily papers may presently give place to hourly papers, each with the\r\nlast news of the last sixty minutes photographically displayed. As a\r\nmatter of fact no human being wants that, and very few are so foolish as\r\nto think they do; the only kind of news that any sort of people clamours\r\nfor hot and hot is financial and betting fluctuations, lottery lists and\r\nexamination results; and the elaborated and cheapened telegraphic and\r\ntelephonic system of the coming days, with tapes (or phonograph to\r\nreplace them) in every post-office and nearly every private house, so\r\nfar from expanding this department, will probably sweep it out of the\r\npapers altogether. One will subscribe to a news agency which will wire\r\nall the stuff one cares to have so violently fresh, into a phonographic\r\nrecorder perhaps, in some convenient corner. There the thing will be in\r\nevery house, beside the barometer, to hear or ignore. With the\r\nseparation of that function what is left of the newspaper will revert to\r\none daily edition--daily, I think, because of the power of habit to make\r\nthe newspaper the specific business of some definite moments in the day;\r\nthe breakfast hour, I suppose, or the \"up-to-town\" journey with most\r\nEnglishmen now. Quite possibly some one will discover some day that\r\nthere is now machinery for folding and fastening a paper into a form\r\nthat will not inevitably get into the butter, or lead to bitterness in a\r\nrailway carriage. This pitch of development reached, I incline to\r\nanticipate daily papers much more like the _Spectator_ in form than\r\nthese present mainsails of our public life. They will probably not\r\ncontain fiction at all, and poetry only rarely, because no one but a\r\npartial imbecile wants these things in punctual daily doses, and we are\r\nanticipating an escape from a period of partial imbecility. My own\r\nculture and turn of mind, which is probably akin to that of a\r\nrespectable mechanic of the year 2000, inclines me towards a daily paper\r\nthat will have in addition to its concentrated and absolutely\r\ntrustworthy daily news, full and luminous accounts of new inventions,\r\nnew theories, and new departures of all sorts (usually illustrated),\r\nwitty and penetrating comments upon public affairs, criticisms of all\r\nsorts of things, representations of newly produced works of art, and an\r\nample amount of ably written controversy upon everything under the sun.\r\nThe correspondence columns, instead of being an exercising place for\r\nbores and conspicuous people who are not mercenary, will be the most\r\nample, the most carefully collected, and the most highly paid of all\r\ndepartments in this paper. Personal paragraphs will be relegated to some\r\nobscure and costly corner next to the births, deaths, and marriages.\r\nThis paper will have, of course, many pages of business advertisements,\r\nand these will usually be well worth looking through, for the more\r\nintelligent editors of the days to come will edit this department just\r\nlike any other, and classify their advertisements in a descending scale\r\nof freshness and interest that will also be an ascending scale of price.\r\nThe advertiser who wants to be an indecent bore, and vociferate for the\r\nten millionth time some flatulent falsehood about a pill, for instance,\r\nwill pay at nuisance rates. Probably many papers will refuse to print\r\nnasty and distressful advertisements about people's insides at all. The\r\nentire paper will be as free from either greyness or offensive stupidity\r\nin its advertisement columns as the shop windows in Bond Street to-day,\r\nand for much the same reason,--because the people who go that way do not\r\nwant that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that, since the real income of the newspaper is\r\nderived from advertisements, large advertisers will combine in the\r\nfuture to own papers confined to the advertisements of their specific\r\nwares. Some such monopoly is already attempted; several publishing firms\r\nown or partially own a number of provincial papers, which they adorn\r\nwith strange \"Book Chat\" columns conspicuously deficient in their\r\ninformation; and a well-known cycle tyre firm supplies \"Cycling\" columns\r\nthat are mere pedestals for the Head-of-King-Charles make of tyre. Many\r\nquack firms publish and give away annual almanacks replete with\r\neconomical illustrations, offensive details, and bad jokes. But I\r\nventure to think, in spite of such phenomena, that these suggestions and\r\nattempts are made with a certain disregard of the essential conditions\r\nof sound advertisement. Sound advertisement consists in perpetual\r\nalertness and newness, in appearance in new places and in new aspects,\r\nin the constant access to fresh minds. The devotion of a newspaper to\r\nthe interest of one particular make of a commodity or group of\r\ncommodities will inevitably rob its advertisement department of most of\r\nits interest for the habitual readers of the paper. That is to say, the\r\nnewspaper will fail in what is one of the chief attractions of a good\r\nnewspaper. Moreover, such a devotion will react upon all the other\r\nmatter in the paper, because the editor will need to be constantly alert\r\nto exclude seditious reflections upon the Health-Extract-of-Horse-Flesh\r\nor Saved-by-Boiling-Jam. His sense of this relation will taint his\r\nself-respect and make him a less capable editor than a man whose sole\r\naffair is to keep his paper interesting. To these more interesting rival\r\npapers the excluded competitor will be driven, and the reader will\r\nfollow in his wake. There is little more wisdom in the proprietor of an\r\narticle in popular demand buying or creating a newspaper to contain all\r\nhis advertisements than in his buying a coal pit for the same purpose.\r\nSuch a privacy of advertisement will never work, I think, on a large\r\nscale; it is probably at or near its maximum development now, and this\r\nanticipation of the advertiser-owned paper, like that of hourly papers,\r\nand that wonderfully powerful cosmic newspaper syndicate, is simply\r\nanother instance of prophesying based only on a present trend, an\r\nexpansion of the obvious, instead of an analysis of determining forces.\r\n\r\n[36] One striking illustration of the distinctive possibilities of\r\ndemocratic government came to light during the last term of office of\r\nthe present patriotic British Government. As a demonstration of\r\npatriotism large sums of money were voted annually for the purpose of\r\nbuilding warships, and the patriotic common man paid the taxes gladly\r\nwith a dream of irresistible naval predominance to sweeten the payment.\r\nBut the money was not spent on warships; only a portion of it was spent,\r\nand the rest remained to make a surplus and warm the heart of the common\r\nman in his tax-paying capacity. This artful dodge was repeated for\r\nseveral years; the artful dodger is now a peer, no doubt abjectly\r\nrespected, and nobody in the most patriotic party so far evolved is a\r\nbit the worse for it. In the organizing expedients of all popular\r\ngovernments, as in the prospectuses of unsound companies, the\r\ndisposition is to exaggerate the nominal capital at the expense of the\r\nworking efficiency. Democratic armies and navies are always short, and\r\nprobably will always be short, of ammunition, paint, training and\r\nreserve stores; battalions and ships, since they count as units, are\r\nover-numerous and go short-handed, and democratic army reform almost\r\ninvariably works out to some device for multiplying units by fission,\r\nand counting men three times instead of twice in some ingenious and\r\nplausible way. And this must be so, because the sort of men who come\r\ninevitably to power under democratic conditions are men trained by all\r\nthe conditions of their lives to so set appearances before realities as\r\nat last to become utterly incapable of realities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn shaping anticipations of the future of war there arises a certain\r\ndifficulty about the point of departure. One may either begin upon such\r\nbroad issues as the preceding forecasts have opened, and having\r\ndetermined now something of the nature of the coming State and the force\r\nof its warlike inclination, proceed to speculate how this vast\r\nill-organized fourfold organism will fight; or one may set all that\r\nmatter aside for a space, and having regard chiefly to the continually\r\nmore potent appliances physical science offers the soldier, we may try\r\nto develop a general impression of theoretically thorough war, go from\r\nthat to the nature of the State most likely to be superlatively\r\nefficient in such warfare, and so arrive at the conditions of survival\r\nunder which these present governments of confusion will struggle one\r\nagainst the other. The latter course will be taken here. We will deal\r\nfirst of all with war conducted for its own sake, with a model army, as\r\nefficient as an imaginative training can make it, and with a model\r\norganization for warfare of the State behind it, and then the\r\nexperience of the confused modern social organism as it is impelled, in\r\nan uncongenial metamorphosis, towards this imperative and finally\r\nunavoidable efficient state, will come most easily within the scope of\r\none's imagination.\r\n\r\nThe great change that is working itself out in warfare is the same\r\nchange that is working itself out in the substance of the social fabric.\r\nThe essential change in the social fabric, as we have analyzed it, is\r\nthe progressive supersession of the old broad labour base by elaborately\r\norganized mechanism, and the obsolescence of the once valid and\r\nnecessary distinction of gentle and simple. In warfare, as I have\r\nalready indicated, this takes the form of the progressive supersession\r\nof the horse and the private soldier--which were the living and sole\r\nengines of the old time--by machines, and the obliteration of the old\r\ndistinction between leaders, who pranced in a conspicuously dangerous\r\nand encouraging way into the picturesque incidents of battle, and the\r\nled, who cheered and charged and filled the ditches and were slaughtered\r\nin a wholesale dramatic manner. The old war was a matter of long dreary\r\nmarches, great hardships of campaigning, but also of heroic conclusive\r\nmoments. Long periods of campings--almost always with an outbreak of\r\npestilence--of marchings and retreats, much crude business of feeding\r\nand forage, culminated at last, with an effect of infinite relief, in\r\nan hour or so of \"battle.\" The battle was always a very intimate\r\ntumultuous affair, the men were flung at one another in vast excited\r\nmasses, in living fighting machines as it were, spears or bayonets\r\nflashed, one side or the other ceased to prolong the climax, and the\r\nthing was over. The beaten force crumpled as a whole, and the victors as\r\na whole pressed upon it. Cavalry with slashing sabres marked the\r\ncrowning point of victory. In the later stages of the old warfare\r\nmusketry volleys were added to the physical impact of the contending\r\nregiments, and at last cannon, as a quite accessory method of breaking\r\nthese masses of men. So you \"gave battle\" to and defeated your enemy's\r\nforces wherever encountered, and when you reached your objective in his\r\ncapital the war was done.... The new war will probably have none of\r\nthese features of the old system of fighting.\r\n\r\nThe revolution that is in progress from the old war to a new war,\r\ndifferent in its entire nature from the old, is marked primarily by the\r\nsteady progress in range and efficiency of the rifle and of the\r\nfield-gun--and more particularly of the rifle. The rifle develops\r\npersistently from a clumsy implement, that any clown may learn to use in\r\nhalf a day, towards a very intricate mechanism, easily put out of order\r\nand easily misused, but of the most extraordinary possibilities in the\r\nhands of men of courage, character, and high intelligence. Its precision\r\nat long range has made the business of its care, loading and aim\r\nsubsidiary to the far more intricate matter of its use in relation to\r\nthe contour of the ground within its reach. Even its elaboration as an\r\ninstrument is probably still incomplete. One can conceive it provided in\r\nthe future with cross-thread telescopic sights, the focussing of which,\r\ncorrected by some ingenious use of hygroscopic material, might even find\r\nthe range, and so enable it to be used with assurance up to a mile or\r\nmore. It will probably also take on some of the characters of the\r\nmachine-gun. It will be used either for single shots or to quiver and\r\nsend a spray of almost simultaneous bullets out of a magazine evenly and\r\ncertainly, over any small area the rifleman thinks advisable. It will\r\nprobably be portable by one man, but there is no reason really, except\r\nthe bayonet tradition, the demands of which may be met in other ways,\r\nwhy it should be the instrument of one sole man. It will, just as\r\nprobably, be slung with its ammunition and equipment upon bicycle\r\nwheels, and be the common care of two or more associated soldiers.\r\nEquipped with such a weapon, a single couple of marksmen even, by reason\r\nof smokeless powder and carefully chosen cover, might make themselves\r\npractically invisible, and capable of surprising, stopping, and\r\ndestroying a visible enemy in quite considerable numbers who blundered\r\nwithin a mile of them. And a series of such groups of marksmen so\r\narranged as to cover the arrival of reliefs, provisions, and fresh\r\nammunition from the rear, might hold out against any visible attack for\r\nan indefinite period, unless the ground they occupied was searched very\r\nably and subtly by some sort of gun having a range in excess of their\r\nrifle fire. If the ground they occupied were to be properly tunnelled\r\nand trenched, even that might not avail, and there would be nothing for\r\nit but to attack them by an advance under cover either of the night or\r\nof darkness caused by smoke-shells, or by the burning of cover about\r\ntheir position. Even then they might be deadly with magazine fire at\r\nclose quarters. Save for their liability to such attacks, a few hundreds\r\nof such men could hold positions of a quite vast extent, and a few\r\nthousand might hold a frontier. Assuredly a mere handful of such men\r\ncould stop the most multitudinous attack or cover the most disorderly\r\nretreat in the world, and even when some ingenious, daring, and lucky\r\nnight assault had at last ejected them from a position, dawn would\r\nsimply restore to them the prospect of reconstituting in new positions\r\ntheir enormous advantage of defence.\r\n\r\nThe only really effective and final defeat such an attenuated force of\r\nmarksmen could sustain, would be from the slow and circumspect advance\r\nupon it of a similar force of superior marksmen, creeping forward under\r\ncover of night or of smoke-shells and fire, digging pits during the\r\nsnatches of cessation obtained in this way, and so coming nearer and\r\nnearer and getting a completer and completer mastery of the defender's\r\nground until the approach of the defender's reliefs, food, and fresh\r\nammunition ceased to be possible. Thereupon there would be nothing for\r\nit but either surrender or a bolt in the night to positions in the rear,\r\na bolt that might be hotly followed if it were deferred too late.\r\n\r\nProbably between contiguous nations that have mastered the art of war,\r\ninstead of the pouring clouds of cavalry of the old dispensation,[37]\r\nthis will be the opening phase of the struggle, a vast duel all along\r\nthe frontier between groups of skilled marksmen, continually being\r\nrelieved and refreshed from the rear. For a time quite possibly there\r\nwill be no definite army here or there, there will be no controllable\r\nbattle, there will be no Great General in the field at all. But\r\nsomewhere far in the rear the central organizer will sit at the\r\ntelephonic centre of his vast front, and he will strengthen here and\r\nfeed there and watch, watch perpetually the pressure, the incessant\r\nremorseless pressure that is seeking to wear down his countervailing\r\nthrust. Behind the thin firing line that is actually engaged, the\r\ncountry for many miles will be rapidly cleared and devoted to the\r\nbusiness of war, big machines will be at work making second, third, and\r\nfourth lines of trenches that may be needed if presently the firing line\r\nis forced back, spreading out transverse paths for the swift lateral\r\nmovement of the cyclists who will be in perpetual alertness to relieve\r\nsudden local pressures, and all along those great motor roads our first\r\n\"Anticipations\" sketched, there will be a vast and rapid shifting to and\r\nfro of big and very long range guns. These guns will probably be fought\r\nwith the help of balloons. The latter will hang above the firing line\r\nall along the front, incessantly ascending and withdrawn; they will be\r\ncontinually determining the distribution of the antagonist's forces,\r\ndirecting the fire of continually shifting great guns upon the apparatus\r\nand supports in the rear of his fighting line, forecasting his night\r\nplans and seeking some tactical or strategic weakness in that sinewy\r\nline of battle.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident that such warfare as this inevitable precision of gun\r\nand rifle forces upon humanity, will become less and less dramatic as a\r\nwhole, more and more as a whole a monstrous thrust and pressure of\r\npeople against people. No dramatic little general spouting his troops\r\ninto the proper hysterics for charging, no prancing merely brave\r\nofficers, no reckless gallantry or invincible stubbornness of men will\r\nsuffice. For the commander-in-chief on a picturesque horse sentimentally\r\nwatching his \"boys\" march past to death or glory in battalions, there\r\nwill have to be a loyal staff of men, working simply, earnestly, and\r\nsubtly to keep the front tight, and at the front, every little isolated\r\ncompany of men will have to be a council of war, a little conspiracy\r\nunder the able man its captain, as keen and individual as a football\r\nteam, conspiring against the scarcely seen company of the foe over\r\nyonder. The battalion commander will be replaced in effect by the\r\norganizer of the balloons and guns by which his few hundreds of splendid\r\nindividuals will be guided and reinforced. In the place of hundreds of\r\nthousands of more or less drunken and untrained young men marching into\r\nbattle--muddle-headed, sentimental, dangerous and futile\r\nhobbledehoys--there will be thousands of sober men braced up to their\r\nhighest possibilities, intensely doing their best; in the place of\r\ncharging battalions, shattering impacts of squadrons and wide\r\nharvest-fields of death, there will be hundreds of little rifle battles\r\nfought up to the hilt, gallant dashes here, night surprises there, the\r\nsudden sinister faint gleam of nocturnal bayonets, brilliant guesses\r\nthat will drop catastrophic shell and death over hills and forests\r\nsuddenly into carelessly exposed masses of men. For eight miles on\r\neither side of the firing lines--whose fire will probably never\r\naltogether die away while the war lasts--men will live and eat and sleep\r\nunder the imminence of unanticipated death.... Such will be the opening\r\nphase of the war that is speedily to come.\r\n\r\nAnd behind the thin firing line on either side a vast multitude of\r\npeople will be at work; indeed, the whole mass of the efficients in the\r\nState will have to be at work, and most of them will be simply at the\r\nsame work or similar work to that done in peace time--only now as\r\ncombatants upon the lines of communication. The organized staffs of the\r\nbig road managements, now become a part of the military scheme, will be\r\ndeporting women and children and feeble people and bringing up supplies\r\nand supports; the doctors will be dropping from their civil duties into\r\npre-appointed official places, directing the feeding and treatment of\r\nthe shifting masses of people and guarding the valuable manhood of the\r\nfighting apparatus most sedulously from disease;[38] the engineers will\r\nbe entrenching and bringing up a vast variety of complicated and\r\ningenious apparatus designed to surprise and inconvenience the enemy in\r\nnovel ways; the dealers in food and clothing, the manufacturers of all\r\nsorts of necessary stuff, will be converted by the mere declaration of\r\nwar into public servants; a practical realization of socialistic\r\nconceptions will quite inevitably be forced upon the fighting State. The\r\nState that has not incorporated with its fighting organization all its\r\nable-bodied manhood and all its material substance, its roads, vehicles,\r\nengines, foundries, and all its resources of food and clothing; the\r\nState which at the outbreak of war has to bargain with railway and\r\nshipping companies, replace experienced station-masters by inexperienced\r\nofficers, and haggle against alien interests for every sort of supply,\r\nwill be at an overwhelming disadvantage against a State which has\r\nemerged from the social confusion of the present time, got rid of every\r\nvestige of our present distinction between official and governed, and\r\norganized every element in its being.\r\n\r\nI imagine that in this ideal war as compared with the war of to-day,\r\nthere will be a very considerable restriction of the rights of the\r\nnon-combatant. A large part of existing International Law involves a\r\ncurious implication, a distinction between the belligerent government\r\nand its accredited agents in warfare and the general body of its\r\nsubjects. There is a disposition to treat the belligerent government, in\r\nspite of the democratic status of many States, as not fully representing\r\nits people, to establish a sort of world-citizenship in the common mass\r\noutside the official and military class. Protection of the non-combatant\r\nand his property comes at last--in theory at least--within a measurable\r\ndistance of notice boards: \"Combatants are requested to keep off the\r\ngrass.\" This disposition I ascribe to a recognition of that obsolescence\r\nand inadequacy of the formal organization of States, which has already\r\nbeen discussed in this book. It was a disposition that was strongest\r\nperhaps in the earliest decades of the nineteenth century, and stronger\r\nnow than, in the steady and irresistible course of strenuous and\r\nuniversal military preparation, it is likely to be in the future. In our\r\nimaginary twentieth century State, organized primarily for war, this\r\ntendency to differentiate a non-combatant mass in the fighting State\r\nwill certainly not be respected, the State will be organized as a whole\r\nto fight as a whole, it will have triumphantly asserted the universal\r\nduty of its citizens. The military force will be a much ampler\r\norganization than the \"army\" of to-day, it will be not simply the fists\r\nbut the body and brain of the land. The whole apparatus, the whole staff\r\nengaged in internal communication, for example, may conceivably not be\r\nState property and a State service, but if it is not it will assuredly\r\nbe as a whole organized as a volunteer force, that may instantly become\r\na part of the machinery of defence or aggression at the outbreak of\r\nwar.[39] The men may very conceivably not have a uniform, for military\r\nuniforms are simply one aspect of this curious and transitory phase of\r\nrestriction, but they will have their orders and their universal plan.\r\nAs the bells ring and the recording telephones click into every house\r\nthe news that war has come, there will be no running to and fro upon the\r\npublic ways, no bawling upon the moving platforms of the central urban\r\nnuclei, no crowds of silly useless able-bodied people gaping at\r\ninflammatory transparencies outside the offices of sensational papers\r\nbecause the egregious idiots in control of affairs have found them no\r\nbetter employment. Every man will be soberly and intelligently setting\r\nabout the particular thing he has to do--even the rich shareholding sort\r\nof person, the hereditary mortgager of society, will be given something\r\nto do, and if he has learnt nothing else he will serve to tie up parcels\r\nof ammunition or pack army sausage. Very probably the best of such\r\npeople and of the speculative class will have qualified as cyclist\r\nmarksmen for the front, some of them may even have devoted the leisure\r\nof peace to military studies and may be prepared with novel weapons.\r\nRecruiting among the working classes--or, more properly speaking, among\r\nthe People of the Abyss--will have dwindled to the vanishing point;\r\npeople who are no good for peace purposes are not likely to be any good\r\nin such a grave and complicated business as modern war. The spontaneous\r\ntraffic of the roads in peace, will fall now into two streams, one of\r\nwomen and children coming quietly and comfortably out of danger, the\r\nother of men and material going up to the front. There will be no\r\npanics, no hardships, because everything will have been amply\r\npre-arranged--we are dealing with an ideal State. Quietly and\r\ntremendously that State will have gripped its adversary and tightened\r\nits muscles--that is all.\r\n\r\nNow the strategy of this new sort of war in its opening phase will\r\nconsist mainly in very rapid movements of guns and men behind that thin\r\nscreen of marksmen, in order to deal suddenly and unexpectedly some\r\nforcible blow, to snatch at some position into which guns and men may be\r\nthrust to outflank and turn the advantage of the ground against some\r\nportion of the enemy's line. The game will be largely to crowd and\r\ncrumple that line, to stretch it over an arc to the breaking point, to\r\nsecure a position from which to shell and destroy its supports and\r\nprovisions, and to capture or destroy its guns and apparatus, and so\r\ntear it away from some town or arsenal it has covered. And a factor of\r\nprimary importance in this warfare, because of the importance of seeing\r\nthe board, a factor which will be enormously stimulated to develop in\r\nthe future, will be the aerial factor. Already we have seen the captive\r\nballoon as an incidental accessory of considerable importance even in\r\nthe wild country warfare of South Africa. In the warfare that will go on\r\nin the highly-organized European States of the opening century, the\r\nspecial military balloon used in conjunction with guns, conceivably of\r\nsmall calibre but of enormous length and range, will play a part of\r\nquite primary importance. These guns will be carried on vast mechanical\r\ncarriages, possibly with wheels of such a size as will enable them to\r\ntraverse almost all sorts of ground.[40] The aeronauts, provided with\r\nlarge scale maps of the hostile country, will mark down to the gunners\r\nbelow the precise point upon which to direct their fire, and over hill\r\nand dale the shell will fly--ten miles it may be--to its billet, camp,\r\nmassing night attack, or advancing gun.\r\n\r\nGreat multitudes of balloons will be the Argus eyes of the entire\r\nmilitary organism, stalked eyes with a telephonic nerve in each stalk,\r\nand at night they will sweep the country with search-lights and come\r\nsoaring before the wind with hanging flares. Certainly they will be\r\nsteerable. Moreover, when the wind admits, there will be freely-moving\r\nsteerable balloons wagging little flags to their friends below. And so\r\nfar as the resources of the men on the ground go, the balloons will be\r\nalmost invulnerable. The mere perforation of balloons with shot does\r\nthem little harm, and the possibility of hitting a balloon that is\r\ndrifting about at a practically unascertainable distance and height so\r\nprecisely as to blow it to pieces with a timed shell, and to do this in\r\nthe little time before it is able to give simple and precise\r\ninstructions as to your range and position to the unseen gunners it\r\ndirects, is certainly one of the most difficult and trying undertakings\r\nfor an artilleryman that one can well imagine. I am inclined to think\r\nthat the many considerations against a successful attack on balloons\r\nfrom the ground, will enormously stimulate enterprise and invention in\r\nthe direction of dirigible aerial devices that can fight. Few people, I\r\nfancy, who know the work of Langley, Lilienthal, Pilcher, Maxim, and\r\nChanute, but will be inclined to believe that long before the year A.D.\r\n2000, and very probably before 1950, a successful aeroplane will have\r\nsoared and come home safe and sound. Directly that is accomplished the\r\nnew invention will be most assuredly applied to war.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the things that will ultimately fight in the sky is a\r\nmatter for curious speculation. We begin with the captive balloon.\r\nAgainst that the navigable balloon will presently operate. I am inclined\r\nto think the practicable navigable balloon will be first attained by the\r\nuse of a device already employed by Nature in the swimming-bladder of\r\nfishes. This is a closed gas-bag that can be contracted or expanded. If\r\na gas-bag of thin, strong, practically impervious substance could be\r\nenclosed in a net of closely interlaced fibres (interlaced, for example,\r\non the pattern of the muscles of the bladder in mammals), the ends of\r\nthese fibres might be wound and unwound, and the effect of contractility\r\nattained. A row of such contractile balloons, hung over a long car which\r\nwas horizontally expanded into wings, would not only allow that car to\r\nrise and fall at will, but if the balloon at one end were contracted\r\nand that at the other end expanded, and the intermediate ones allowed to\r\nassume intermediate conditions, the former end would drop, the expanded\r\nwings would be brought into a slanting condition over a smaller area of\r\nsupporting air, and the whole apparatus would tend to glide downwards in\r\nthat direction. The projection of a small vertical plane upon either\r\nside would make the gliding mass rotate in a descending spiral, and so\r\nwe have all the elements of a controllable flight. Such an affair would\r\nbe difficult to overset. It would be able to beat up even in a fair\r\nwind, and then it would be able to contract its bladders and fall down a\r\nlong slant in any direction. From some such crude beginning a form like\r\na soaring, elongated, flat-brimmed hat might grow, and the possibilities\r\nof adding an engine-driven screw are obvious enough.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see how such a contrivance could carry guns of any\r\ncalibre unless they fired from the rear in the line of flight. The\r\nproblem of recoil becomes a very difficult one in aerial tactics. It\r\nwould probably have at most a small machine-gun or so, which might fire\r\nan explosive shell at the balloons of the enemy, or kill their aeronauts\r\nwith distributed bullets. The thing would be a sort of air-shark, and\r\none may even venture to picture something of the struggle the deadlocked\r\nmarksmen of 1950, lying warily in their rifle-pits, will see.\r\n\r\nOne conceives them at first, each little hole with its watchful,\r\nwell-equipped couple of assassins, turning up their eyes in expectation.\r\nThe wind is with our enemy, and his captive balloons have been\r\ndisagreeably overhead all through the hot morning. His big guns have\r\nsuddenly become nervously active. Then, a little murmur along the pits\r\nand trenches, and from somewhere over behind us, this air-shark drives\r\nup the sky. The enemy's balloons splutter a little, retract, and go\r\nrushing down, and we send a spray of bullets as they drop. Then against\r\nour aerostat, and with the wind driving them clean overhead of us, come\r\nthe antagonistic flying-machines. I incline to imagine there will be a\r\nsteel prow with a cutting edge at either end of the sort of aerostat I\r\nforesee, and conceivably this aerial ram will be the most important\r\nweapon of the affair. When operating against balloons, such a\r\nfighting-machine will rush up the air as swiftly as possible, and then,\r\nwith a rapid contraction of its bladders, fling itself like a knife at\r\nthe sinking war-balloon of the foe. Down, down, down, through a vast\r\nalert tension of flight, down it will swoop, and, if its stoop is\r\nsuccessful, slash explosively at last through a suffocating moment.\r\nRifles will crack, ropes tear and snap; there will be a rending and\r\nshouting, a great thud of liberated gas, and perhaps a flare. Quite\r\ncertainly those flying machines will carry folded parachutes, and the\r\nlast phase of many a struggle will be the desperate leap of the\r\naeronauts with these in hand, to snatch one last chance of life out of\r\na mass of crumpling, fallen wreckage.\r\n\r\nBut in such a fight between flying-machine and flying-machine as we are\r\ntrying to picture, it will be a fight of hawks, complicated by bullets\r\nand little shells. They will rush up and up to get the pitch of one\r\nanother, until the aeronauts sob and sicken in the rarefied air, and the\r\nblood comes to eyes and nails. The marksmen below will strain at last,\r\neyes under hands, to see the circling battle that dwindles in the\r\nzenith. Then, perhaps, a wild adventurous dropping of one close beneath\r\nthe other, an attempt to stoop, the sudden splutter of guns, a tilting\r\nup or down, a disengagement. What will have happened? One combatant,\r\nperhaps, will heel lamely earthward, dropping, dropping, with half its\r\nbladders burst or shot away, the other circles down in pursuit.... \"What\r\nare they doing?\" Our marksmen will snatch at their field-glasses,\r\ntremulously anxious, \"Is that a white flag or no?... If they drop now we\r\nhave 'em!\"\r\n\r\nBut the duel will be the rarer thing. In any affair of ramming there is\r\nan enormous advantage for the side that can contrive, anywhere in the\r\nfield of action, to set two vessels at one. The mere ascent of one\r\nflying-ram from one side will assuredly slip the leashes of two on the\r\nother, until the manoeuvring squadrons may be as thick as starlings in\r\nOctober. They will wheel and mount, they will spread and close, there\r\nwill be elaborate manoeuvres for the advantage of the wind, there will\r\nbe sudden drops to the shelter of entrenched guns. The actual impact of\r\nbattle will be an affair of moments. They will be awful moments, but not\r\nmore terrible, not more exacting of manhood than the moments that will\r\ncome to men when there is--and it has not as yet happened on this\r\nearth--equal fighting between properly manned and equipped ironclads at\r\nsea. (And the well-bred young gentlemen of means who are privileged to\r\nofficer the British Army nowadays will be no more good at this sort of\r\nthing than they are at controversial theology or electrical engineering\r\nor anything else that demands a well-exercised brain.)...\r\n\r\nOnce the command of the air is obtained by one of the contending armies,\r\nthe war must become a conflict between a seeing host and one that is\r\nblind. The victor in that aerial struggle will tower with pitilessly\r\nwatchful eyes over his adversary, will concentrate his guns and all his\r\nstrength unobserved, will mark all his adversary's roads and\r\ncommunications, and sweep them with sudden incredible disasters of shot\r\nand shell. The moral effect of this predominance will be enormous. All\r\nover the losing country, not simply at his frontier but everywhere, the\r\nvictor will soar. Everybody everywhere will be perpetually and\r\nconstantly looking up, with a sense of loss and insecurity, with a vague\r\nstress of painful anticipations. By day the victor's aeroplanes will\r\nsweep down upon the apparatus of all sorts in the adversary's rear, and\r\nwill drop explosives and incendiary matters upon them,[41] so that no\r\napparatus or camp or shelter will any longer be safe. At night his high\r\nfloating search-lights will go to and fro and discover and check every\r\ndesperate attempt to relieve or feed the exhausted marksmen of the\r\nfighting line. The phase of tension will pass, that weakening opposition\r\nwill give, and the war from a state of mutual pressure and petty combat\r\nwill develop into the collapse of the defensive lines. A general advance\r\nwill occur under the aerial van, ironclad road fighting-machines may\r\nperhaps play a considerable part in this, and the enemy's line of\r\nmarksmen will be driven back or starved into surrender, or broken up and\r\nhunted down. As the superiority of the attack becomes week by week more\r\nand more evident, its assaults will become more dashing and\r\nfar-reaching. Under the moonlight and the watching balloons there will\r\nbe swift noiseless rushes of cycles, precipitate dismounts, and the\r\nnever-to-be-quite-abandoned bayonet will play its part. And now men on\r\nthe losing side will thank God for the reprieve of a pitiless wind, for\r\nlightning, thunder, and rain, for any elemental disorder that will for a\r\nmoment lift the descending scale! Then, under banks of fog and cloud,\r\nthe victorious advance will pause and grow peeringly watchful and\r\nnervous, and mud-stained desperate men will go splashing forward into an\r\nelemental blackness, rain or snow like a benediction on their faces,\r\nblessing the primordial savagery of nature that can still set aside the\r\nwisest devices of men, and give the unthrifty one last desperate chance\r\nto get their own again or die.\r\n\r\nSuch adventures may rescue pride and honour, may cause momentary dismay\r\nin the victor and palliate disaster, but they will not turn back the\r\nadvance of the victors, or twist inferiority into victory. Presently the\r\nadvance will resume. With that advance the phase of indecisive contest\r\nwill have ended, and the second phase of the new war, the business of\r\nforcing submission, will begin. This should be more easy in the future\r\neven than it has proved in the past, in spite of the fact that central\r\ngovernments are now elusive, and small bodies of rifle-armed guerillas\r\nfar more formidable than ever before. It will probably be brought about\r\nin a civilized country by the seizure of the vital apparatus of the\r\nurban regions--the water supply, the generating stations for electricity\r\n(which will supply all the heat and warmth of the land), and the chief\r\nways used in food distribution. Through these expedients, even while the\r\nformal war is still in progress, an irresistible pressure upon a local\r\npopulation will be possible, and it will be easy to subjugate or to\r\ncreate afresh local authorities, who will secure the invader from any\r\ndanger of a guerilla warfare upon his rear. Through that sort of an\r\nexpedient an even very obdurate loser will be got down to submission,\r\narea by area. With the destruction of its military apparatus and the\r\nprospective loss of its water and food supply, however, the defeated\r\ncivilized State will probably be willing to seek terms as a whole, and\r\nbring the war to a formal close.\r\n\r\nIn cases where, instead of contiguous frontiers, the combatants are\r\nseparated by the sea, the aerial struggle will probably be preceded or\r\naccompanied by a struggle for the command of the sea. Of this warfare\r\nthere have been many forecasts. In this, as in all the warfare of the\r\ncoming time, imaginative foresight, a perpetual alteration of tactics, a\r\nperpetual production of unanticipated devices, will count enormously.\r\nOther things being equal, victory will rest with the force mentally most\r\nactive. What type of ship may chance to be prevalent when the great\r\nnaval war comes is hard guessing, but I incline to think that the naval\r\narchitects of the ablest peoples will concentrate more and more upon\r\nspeed and upon range and penetration, and, above all, upon precision of\r\nfire. I seem to see a light type of ironclad, armoured thickly only over\r\nits engines and magazines, murderously equipped, and with a ram--as\r\nalert and deadly as a striking snake. In the battles of the open she\r\nwill have little to fear from the slow fumbling treacheries of the\r\nsubmarine, she will take as little heed of the chance of a torpedo as a\r\nbarefooted man in battle does of the chance of a fallen dagger in his\r\npath. Unless I know nothing of my own blood, the English and Americans\r\nwill prefer to catch their enemies in ugly weather or at night, and then\r\nthey will fight to ram. The struggle on the high seas between any two\r\nnaval powers (except, perhaps, the English and American, who have both\r\nquite unparalleled opportunities for coaling) will not last more than a\r\nweek or so. One or other force will be destroyed at sea, driven into its\r\nports and blockaded there, or cut off from its supply of coal (or other\r\nforce-generator), and hunted down to fight or surrender. An inferior\r\nfleet that tries to keep elusively at sea will always find a superior\r\nfleet between itself and coal, and will either have to fight at once or\r\nbe shot into surrender as it lies helpless on the water. Some\r\ncommerce-destroying enterprise on the part of the loser may go on, but I\r\nthink the possibilities of that sort of thing are greatly exaggerated.\r\nThe world grows smaller and smaller, the telegraph and telephone go\r\neverywhere, wireless telegraphy opens wider and wider possibilities to\r\nthe imagination, and how the commerce-destroyer is to go on for long\r\nwithout being marked down, headed off, cut off from coal, and forced to\r\nfight or surrender, I do not see. The commerce-destroyer will have a\r\nvery short run; it will have to be an exceptionally good and costly\r\nship in the first place, it will be finally sunk or captured, and\r\naltogether I do not see how that sort of thing will pay when once the\r\ncommand of the sea is assured. A few weeks will carry the effective\r\nfrontier of the stronger power up to the coast-line of the weaker, and\r\npermit of the secure resumption of the over-sea trade of the former. And\r\nthen will open a second phase of naval warfare, in which the submarine\r\nmay play a larger part.\r\n\r\nI must confess that my imagination, in spite even of spurring, refuses\r\nto see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and\r\nfounder at sea. It must involve physical inconvenience of the most\r\ndemoralizing sort simply to be in one for any length of time. A\r\nfirst-rate man who has been breathing carbonic acid and oil vapour under\r\na pressure of four atmospheres becomes presently a second-rate man.\r\nImagine yourself in a submarine that has ventured a few miles out of\r\nport, imagine that you have headache and nausea, and that some ship of\r\nthe _Cobra_ type is flashing itself and its search-lights about whenever\r\nyou come up to the surface, and promptly tearing down on your descending\r\nbubbles with a ram, trailing perhaps a tail of grapples or a net as\r\nwell. Even if you get their boat, these nicely aerated men you are\r\nfighting know they have a four to one chance of living; while for your\r\nsubmarine to be \"got\" is certain death. You may, of course, throw out a\r\ntorpedo or so, with as much chance of hitting vitally as you would have\r\nif you were blindfolded, turned round three times, and told to fire\r\nrevolver-shots at a charging elephant. The possibility of sweeping for a\r\nsubmarine with a seine would be vividly present in the minds of a\r\nsubmarine crew. If you are near shore you will probably be near\r\nrocks--an unpleasant complication in a hurried dive. There would,\r\nprobably, very soon be boats out too, seeking with a machine-gun or\r\npompom for a chance at your occasionally emergent conning-tower. In no\r\nway can a submarine be more than purblind, it will be, in fact,\r\npractically blind. Given a derelict ironclad on a still night within\r\nsight of land, a carefully handled submarine might succeed in groping\r\nits way to it and destroying it; but then it would be much better to\r\nattack such a vessel and capture it boldly with a few desperate men on a\r\ntug. At the utmost the submarine will be used in narrow waters, in\r\nrivers, or to fluster or destroy ships in harbour or with poor-spirited\r\ncrews--that is to say, it will simply be an added power in the hands of\r\nthe nation that is predominant at sea. And, even then, it can be merely\r\ndestructive, while a sane and high-spirited fighter will always be\r\ndissatisfied if, with an indisputable superiority of force, he fails to\r\ntake.[42]\r\n\r\nNo; the naval warfare of the future is for light, swift ships, almost\r\nrecklessly not defensive and with splendid guns and gunners. They will\r\nhit hard and ram, and warfare which is taking to cover on land will\r\nabandon it at sea. And the captain, and the engineer, and the gunner\r\nwill have to be all of the same sort of men: capable, headlong men, with\r\nbrains and no ascertainable social position. They will differ from the\r\nofficers of the British Navy in the fact that the whole male sex of the\r\nnation will have been ransacked to get them. The incredible stupidity\r\nthat closes all but a menial position in the British Navy to the sons of\r\nthose who cannot afford to pay a hundred a year for them for some years,\r\nnecessarily brings the individual quality of the British naval officer\r\nbelow the highest possible, quite apart from the deficiencies that must\r\nexist on account of the badness of secondary education in England. The\r\nBritish naval officer and engineer are not made the best of, good as\r\nthey are, indisputably they might be infinitely better both in quality\r\nand training. The smaller German navy, probably, has an ampler pick of\r\nmen relatively, is far better educated, less confident, and more\r\nstrenuous. But the abstract navy I am here writing of will be superior\r\nto either of these, and like the American, in the absence of any\r\ndistinction between officers and engineers. The officer will be an\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nThe military advantages of the command of the sea will probably be\r\ngreater in the future than they have been in the past. A fleet with\r\naerial supports would be able to descend upon any portion of the\r\nadversary's coast it chose, and to dominate the country inland for\r\nseveral miles with its gun-fire. All the enemy's sea-coast towns would\r\nbe at its mercy. It would be able to effect landing and send raids of\r\ncyclist-marksmen inland, whenever a weak point was discovered. Landings\r\nwill be enormously easier than they have ever been before. Once a wedge\r\nof marksmen has been driven inland they would have all the military\r\nadvantages of the defence when it came to eject them. They might, for\r\nexample, encircle and block some fortified post, and force costly and\r\ndisastrous attempts to relieve it. The defensive country would stand at\r\nbay, tethered against any effective counter-blow, keeping guns,\r\nsupplies, and men in perpetual and distressing movement to and fro along\r\nits sea-frontiers. Its soldiers would get uncertain rest, irregular\r\nfeeding, unhealthy conditions of all sorts in hastily made camps. The\r\nattacking fleet would divide and re-unite, break up and vanish,\r\namazingly reappear. The longer the defender's coast the more wretched\r\nhis lot. Never before in the world's history was the command of the sea\r\nworth what it is now. But the command of the sea is, after all, like\r\nmilitary predominance on land, to be insured only by superiority of\r\nequipment in the hands of a certain type of man, a type of man that it\r\nbecomes more and more impossible to improvise, that a country must live\r\nfor through many years, and that no country on earth at present can be\r\nsaid to be doing its best possible to make.\r\n\r\nAll this elaboration of warfare lengthens the scale between theoretical\r\nefficiency and absolute unpreparedness. There was a time when any tribe\r\nthat had men and spears was ready for war, and any tribe that had some\r\ncunning or emotion at command might hope to discount any little\r\ndisparity in numbers between itself and its neighbour. Luck and\r\nstubbornness and the incalculable counted for much; it was half the\r\nbattle not to know you were beaten, and it is so still. Even to-day, a\r\ngreat nation, it seems, may still make its army the plaything of its\r\ngentlefolk, abandon important military appointments to feminine\r\nintrigue, and trust cheerfully to the homesickness and essential modesty\r\nof its influential people, and the simpler patriotism of its colonial\r\ndependencies when it comes at last to the bloody and wearisome business\r\nof \"muddling through.\" But these days of the happy-go-lucky optimist are\r\nnear their end. War is being drawn into the field of the exact sciences.\r\nEvery additional weapon, every new complication of the art of war,\r\nintensifies the need of deliberate preparation, and darkens the outlook\r\nof a nation of amateurs. Warfare in the future, on sea or land alike,\r\nwill be much more one-sided than it has ever been in the past, much more\r\nof a foregone conclusion. Save for national lunacy, it will be brought\r\nabout by the side that will win, and because that side knows that it\r\nwill win. More and more it will have the quality of surprise, of\r\npitiless revelation. Instead of the seesaw, the bickering interchange of\r\nbattles of the old time, will come swiftly and amazingly blow, and blow,\r\nand blow, no pause, no time for recovery, disasters cumulative and\r\nirreparable.\r\n\r\nThe fight will never be in practice between equal sides, never be that\r\ntheoretical deadlock we have sketched, but a fight between the more\r\nefficient and the less efficient, between the more inventive and the\r\nmore traditional. While the victors, disciplined and grimly intent, full\r\nof the sombre yet glorious delight of a grave thing well done, will,\r\nwithout shouting or confusion, be fighting like one great national body,\r\nthe losers will be taking that pitiless exposure of helplessness in such\r\na manner as their natural culture and character may determine. War for\r\nthe losing side will be an unspeakable pitiable business. There will be\r\nfirst of all the coming of the war, the wave of excitement, the\r\nbelligerent shouting of the unemployed inefficients, the flag-waving,\r\nthe secret doubts, the eagerness for hopeful news, the impatience of the\r\nwarning voice. I seem to see, almost as if he were symbolic, the grey\r\nold general--the general who learnt his art of war away in the vanished\r\nnineteenth century, the altogether too elderly general with his\r\nepaulettes and decorations, his uniform that has still its historical\r\nvalue, his spurs and his sword--riding along on his obsolete horse, by\r\nthe side of his doomed column. Above all things he is a gentleman. And\r\nthe column looks at him lovingly with its countless boys' faces, and the\r\nboys' eyes are infinitely trustful, for he has won battles in the old\r\ntime. They will believe in him to the end. They have been brought up in\r\ntheir schools to believe in him and his class, their mothers have\r\nmingled respect for the gentlefolk with the simple doctrines of their\r\nfaith, their first lesson on entering the army was the salute. The\r\n\"smart\" helmets His Majesty, or some such unqualified person, chose for\r\nthem, lie hotly on their young brows, and over their shoulders slope\r\ntheir obsolete, carelessly-sighted guns. Tramp, tramp, they march, doing\r\nwhat they have been told to do, incapable of doing anything they have\r\nnot been told to do, trustful and pitiful, marching to wounds and\r\ndisease, hunger, hardship, and death. They know nothing of what they are\r\ngoing to meet, nothing of what they will have to do; Religion and the\r\nRatepayer and the Rights of the Parent working through the\r\ninstrumentality of the Best Club in the World have kept their souls and\r\nminds, if not untainted, at least only harmlessly veneered, with the\r\nthinnest sham of training or knowledge. Tramp, tramp, they go, boys who\r\nwill never be men, rejoicing patriotically in the nation that has thus\r\nsent them forth, badly armed, badly clothed, badly led, to be killed in\r\nsome avoidable quarrel by men unseen. And beside them, an absolute\r\nstranger to them, a stranger even in habits of speech and thought, and\r\nat any rate to be shot with them fairly and squarely, marches the\r\nsubaltern--the son of the school-burking, shareholding class--a slightly\r\ntaller sort of boy, as ill-taught as they are in all that concerns the\r\nrealities of life, ignorant of how to get food, how to get water, how to\r\nkeep fever down and strength up, ignorant of his practical equality with\r\nthe men beside him, carefully trained under a clerical headmaster to use\r\na crib, play cricket rather nicely, look all right whatever happens,\r\nbelieve in his gentility, and avoid talking \"shop.\"... The major you\r\nsee is a man of the world, and very pleasantly meets the grey general's\r\neye. He is, one may remark by the way, something of an army reformer,\r\nwithout offence, of course, to the Court people or the Government\r\npeople. His prospects--if only he were not going to be shot--are\r\nbrilliant enough. He has written quite cleverly on the question of\r\nRecruiting, and advocated as much as twopence more a day and billiard\r\nrooms under the chaplain's control; he has invented a military bicycle\r\nwith a wheel of solid iron that can be used as a shield; and a war\r\ncorrespondent and, indeed, any one who writes even the most casual and\r\nirresponsible article on military questions is a person worth his\r\ncultivating. He is the very life and soul of army reform, as it is known\r\nto the governments of the grey--that is to say, army reform without a\r\nsingle step towards a social revolution....\r\n\r\nSo the gentlemanly old general--the polished drover to the\r\nshambles--rides, and his doomed column march by, in this vision that\r\nhaunts my mind.\r\n\r\nI cannot foresee what such a force will even attempt to do, against\r\nmodern weapons. Nothing can happen but the needless and most wasteful\r\nand pitiful killing of these poor lads, who make up the infantry\r\nbattalions, the main mass of all the European armies of to-day, whenever\r\nthey come against a sanely-organized army. There is nowhere they can\r\ncome in, there is nothing they can do. The scattered invisible marksmen\r\nwith their supporting guns will shatter their masses, pick them off\r\nindividually, cover their line of retreat and force them into wholesale\r\nsurrenders. It will be more like herding sheep than actual fighting. Yet\r\nthe bitterest and cruellest things will have to happen, thousands and\r\nthousands of poor boys will be smashed in all sorts of dreadful ways and\r\ngiven over to every conceivable form of avoidable hardship and painful\r\ndisease, before the obvious fact that war is no longer a business for\r\nhalf-trained lads in uniform, led by parson-bred sixth-form boys and men\r\nof pleasure and old men, but an exhaustive demand upon very\r\ncarefully-educated adults for the most strenuous best that is in them,\r\nwill get its practical recognition.[43]...\r\n\r\nWell, in the ampler prospect even this haunting tragedy of innumerable\r\navoidable deaths is but an incidental thing. They die, and their\r\ntroubles are over. The larger fact after all is the inexorable tendency\r\nin things to make a soldier a skilled and educated man, and to link him,\r\nin sympathy and organization, with the engineer and the doctor, and all\r\nthe continually developing mass of scientifically educated men that the\r\nadvance of science and mechanism is producing. We are dealing with the\r\ninter-play of two world-wide forces, that work through distinctive and\r\ncontrasted tendencies to a common end. We have the force of invention\r\ninsistent upon a progress of the peace organization, which tends on the\r\none hand to throw out great useless masses of people, the People of the\r\nAbyss, and on the other hand to develop a sort of adiposity of\r\nfunctionless wealthy, a speculative elephantiasis, and to promote the\r\ndevelopment of a new social order of efficients, only very painfully and\r\nslowly, amidst these growing and yet disintegrating masses. And on the\r\nother hand we have the warlike drift of such a social body, the\r\ninevitable intensification of international animosities in such a body,\r\nthe absolute determination evident in the scheme of things to smash such\r\na body, to smash it just as far as it is such a body, under the hammer\r\nof war, that must finally bring about rapidly and under pressure the\r\nsame result as that to which the peaceful evolution slowly tends. While\r\nwe are as yet only thinking of a physiological struggle, of complex\r\nreactions and slow absorptions, comes War with the surgeon's knife. War\r\ncomes to simplify the issue and line out the thing with knife-like\r\ncuts.\r\n\r\nThe law that dominates the future is glaringly plain. A people must\r\ndevelop and consolidate its educated efficient classes or be beaten in\r\nwar and give way upon all points where its interests conflict with the\r\ninterests of more capable people. It must foster and accelerate that\r\nnatural segregation, which has been discussed in the third and fourth\r\nchapters of these \"Anticipations,\" or perish. The war of the coming time\r\nwill really be won in schools and colleges and universities, wherever\r\nmen write and read and talk together. The nation that produces in the\r\nnear future the largest proportional development of educated and\r\nintelligent engineers and agriculturists, of doctors, schoolmasters,\r\nprofessional soldiers, and intellectually active people of all sorts;\r\nthe nation that most resolutely picks over, educates, sterilizes,\r\nexports, or poisons its People of the Abyss; the nation that succeeds\r\nmost subtly in checking gambling and the moral decay of women and homes\r\nthat gambling inevitably entails; the nation that by wise interventions,\r\ndeath duties and the like, contrives to expropriate and extinguish\r\nincompetent rich families while leaving individual ambitions free; the\r\nnation, in a word, that turns the greatest proportion of its\r\nirresponsible adiposity into social muscle, will certainly be the nation\r\nthat will be the most powerful in warfare as in peace, will certainly be\r\nthe ascendant or dominant nation before the year 2000. In the long run\r\nno heroism and no accidents can alter that. No flag-waving, no\r\npatriotic leagues, no visiting of essentially petty imperial personages\r\nhither and thither, no smashing of the windows of outspoken people nor\r\nseizures of papers and books, will arrest the march of national defeat.\r\nAnd this issue is already so plain and simple, the alternatives are\r\nbecoming so pitilessly clear, that even in the stupidest court and the\r\nstupidest constituencies, it must presently begin in some dim way to be\r\nfelt. A time will come when so many people will see this issue clearly\r\nthat it will gravely affect political and social life. The patriotic\r\nparty--the particular gang, that is, of lawyers, brewers, landlords, and\r\nrailway directors that wishes to be dominant--will be forced to become\r\nan efficient party in profession at least, will be forced to stimulate\r\nand organize that educational and social development that may at last\r\neven bring patriotism under control. The rulers of the grey, the\r\ndemocratic politician and the democratic monarch, will be obliged year\r\nby year by the very nature of things to promote the segregation of\r\ncolours within the grey, to foster the power that will finally supersede\r\ndemocracy and monarchy altogether, the power of the scientifically\r\neducated, disciplined specialist, and that finally is the power of\r\nsaints, the power of the thing that is provably right. It may be\r\ndelayed, but it cannot be defeated; in the end it must arrive--if not\r\nto-day and among our people, then to-morrow and among another people,\r\nwho will triumph in our overthrow. This is the lesson that must be\r\nlearnt, that some tongue and kindred of the coming time must inevitably\r\nlearn. But what tongue it will be, and what kindred that will first\r\nattain this new development, opens far more complex and far less certain\r\nissues than any we have hitherto considered.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] Even along such vast frontiers as the Russian and Austrian, for\r\nexample, where M. Bloch anticipates war will be begun with an invasion\r\nof clouds of Russian cavalry and great cavalry battles, I am inclined to\r\nthink this deadlock of essentially defensive marksmen may still be the\r\nmore probable thing. Small bodies of cyclist riflemen would rush forward\r\nto meet the advancing clouds of cavalry, would drop into invisible\r\nambushes, and announce their presence--in unknown numbers--with\r\ncarefully aimed shots difficult to locate. A small number of such men\r\ncould always begin their fight with a surprise at the most advantageous\r\nmoment, and they would be able to make themselves very deadly against a\r\ncomparatively powerful frontal attack. If at last the attack were driven\r\nhome before supports came up to the defenders, they would still be able\r\nto cycle away, comparatively immune. To attempt even very wide flanking\r\nmovements against such a snatched position would be simply to run risks\r\nof blundering upon similar ambushes. The clouds of cavalry would have to\r\nspread into thin lines at last and go forward with the rifle. Invading\r\nclouds of cyclists would be in no better case. A conflict of cyclists\r\nagainst cyclists over a country too spacious for unbroken lines, would\r\nstill, I think, leave the struggle essentially unchanged. The advance of\r\nsmall unsupported bodies would be the wildest and most unprofitable\r\nadventure; every advance would have to be made behind a screen of\r\nscouts, and, given a practical equality in the numbers and manhood of\r\nthe two forces, these screens would speedily become simply very\r\nattenuated lines.\r\n\r\n[38] So far, pestilence has been a feature of almost every sustained war\r\nin the world, but there is really no reason whatever why it should be\r\nso. There is no reason, indeed, why a soldier upon active service on the\r\nvictorious side should go without a night's rest or miss a meal. If he\r\ndoes, there is muddle and want of foresight somewhere, and that our\r\nhypothesis excludes.\r\n\r\n[39] Lady Maud Rolleston, in her very interesting _Yeoman Service_,\r\ncomplains of the Boers killing an engine-driver during an attack on a\r\ntrain at Kroonstadt, \"which was,\" she writes, \"an abominable action, as\r\nhe is, in law, a non-combatant.\" The implicit assumption of this\r\ncomplaint would cover the engineers of an ironclad or the guides of a\r\nnight attack, everybody, in fact, who was not positively weapon in hand.\r\n\r\n[40] Experiments will probably be made in the direction of armoured\r\nguns, armoured search-light carriages, and armoured shelters for men,\r\nthat will admit of being pushed forward over rifle-swept ground. To such\r\npossibilities, to possibilities even of a sort of land ironclad, my\r\ninductive reason inclines; the armoured train seems indeed a distinct\r\nbeginning of this sort of thing, but my imagination proffers nothing but\r\na vision of wheels smashed by shells, iron tortoises gallantly rushed by\r\nhidden men, and unhappy marksmen and engineers being shot at as they\r\nbolt from some such monster overset. The fact of it is, I detest and\r\nfear these thick, slow, essentially defensive methods, either for land\r\nor sea fighting. I believe invincibly that the side that can go fastest\r\nand hit hardest will always win, with or without or in spite of massive\r\ndefences, and no ingenuity in devising the massive defence will shake\r\nthat belief.\r\n\r\n[41] Or, in deference to the Rules of War, fire them out of guns of\r\ntrivial carrying power.\r\n\r\n[42] A curious result might very possibly follow a success of submarines\r\non the part of a naval power finally found to be weaker and defeated.\r\nThe victorious power might decide that a narrow sea was no longer, under\r\nthe new conditions, a comfortable boundary line, and might insist on\r\nmarking its boundary along the high-water mark of its adversary's\r\nadjacent coasts.\r\n\r\n[43] There comes to hand as I correct these proofs a very typical\r\nillustration of the atmosphere of really almost imbecile patronage in\r\nwhich the British private soldier lives. It is a circular from some one\r\nat Lydd, some one who evidently cannot even write English, but who is\r\nnevertheless begging for an iron hut in which to inflict lessons on our\r\nsoldiers. \"At present,\" says this circular, \"it is pretty to see in the\r\nHome a group of Gunners busily occupied in wool-work or learning\r\nbasket-making, whilst one of their number sings or recites, and others\r\nare playing games or letter-writing, but even quite recently the members\r\nof the Bible Reading Union and one of the ladies might have been seen\r\npainfully crowded behind screens, choosing the 'Golden Text' with\r\nlowered voices, and trying to pray 'without distraction,' whilst at the\r\nother end of the room men were having supper, and halfway down a dozen\r\nIrish militia (who don't care to read, but are keen on a story) were\r\ngathered round another lady, who was telling them an amusing temperance\r\ntale, trying to speak so that the Bible readers should not hear her and\r\nyet that the Leinsters _should_ was a difficulty, but when the Irishmen\r\nbegged for a song--difficulty became _impossibility_, and their friend\r\nhad to say, '_No._' Yet this is just the double work required in\r\nSoldiers' Homes, and above all at Lydd, where there is so little safe\r\namusement to be had in camp, and none in the village.\" These poor\r\nyoungsters go from this \"safe amusement\" under the loving care of \"lady\r\nworkers,\" this life of limitation, make-believe and spiritual servitude\r\nthat a self-respecting negro would find intolerable, into a warfare that\r\nexacts initiative and a freely acting intelligence from all who take\r\npart in it, under the bitterest penalties of shame and death. What can\r\nyou expect of them? And how can you expect any men of capacity and\r\nenergy, any men even of mediocre self-respect to knowingly place\r\nthemselves under the tutelage of the sort of people who dominate these\r\norganized degradations? I am amazed the army gets so many capable\r\nrecruits as it does. And while the private lives under these conditions,\r\nthe would-be capable officer stifles amidst equally impossible\r\nsurroundings. He must associate with the uneducated products of the\r\npublic schools, and listen to their chatter about the \"sports\" that\r\ndelight them, suffer social indignities from the \"army woman,\" worry and\r\nwaste money on needless clothes, and expect to end by being shamed or\r\nkilled under some unfairly promoted incapable. Nothing illustrates the\r\nintellectual blankness of the British army better than its absolute\r\ndearth of military literature. No one would dream of gaining any profit\r\nby writing or publishing a book upon such a subject, for example, as\r\nmountain warfare in England, because not a dozen British officers would\r\nhave the sense to buy such a book, and yet the British army is\r\ncontinually getting into scrapes in mountain districts. A few unselfish\r\nmen like Major Peech find time to write an essay or so, and that is all.\r\nOn the other hand, I find no less than five works in French on this\r\nsubject in MM. Chapelet & Cie.'s list alone. On guerilla warfare again,\r\nand after two years of South Africa, while there is nothing in English\r\nbut some scattered papers by Dr. T. Miller Maguire, there are nearly a\r\ndozen good books in French. As a supplement to these facts is the\r\nspectacle of the officers of the Guards telegraphing to Sir Thomas\r\nLipton on the occasion of the defeat of his Shamrock II., \"Hard luck. Be\r\nof good cheer. Brigade of Guards wish you every success.\" This is not\r\nthe foolish enthusiasm of one or two subalterns, it is collective. They\r\nfollowed that yacht race with emotion! is a really important thing to\r\nthem. No doubt the whole mess was in a state of extreme excitement. How\r\ncan capable and active men be expected to live and work between this\r\nupper and that nether millstone? The British army not only does not\r\nattract ambitious, energetic men, it repels them. I must confess that I\r\nsee no hope either in the rulers, the traditions, or the manhood of the\r\nBritish regular army, to forecast its escape from the bog of ignorance\r\nand negligence in which it wallows. Far better than any of projected\r\nreforms would it be to let the existing army severely alone, to cease to\r\nrecruit for it, to retain (at the expense of its officers, assisted\r\nperhaps by subscriptions from ascendant people like Sir Thomas Lipton)\r\nits messes, its uniforms, its games, bands, entertainments, and splendid\r\nmemories as an appendage of the Court, and to create, in absolute\r\nindependence of it, battalions and batteries of efficient professional\r\nsoldiers, without social prestige or social distinctions, without bands,\r\ndress uniforms, colours, chaplains or honorary colonels, and to embody\r\nthese as a real marching army perpetually _en route_ throughout the\r\nempire--a reading, thinking, experimenting army under an absolutely\r\ndistinct war office, with its own colleges, depôts and training camps\r\nperpetually ready for war. I cannot help but think that, if a hint were\r\ntaken from the _Turbinia_ syndicate, a few enterprising persons of means\r\nand intelligence might do much by private experiment to supplement and\r\nreplace the existing state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE CONFLICT OF LANGUAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have brought together thus far in these Anticipations the material\r\nfor the picture of a human community somewhere towards the year 2000. We\r\nhave imagined its roads, the type and appearance of its homes, its\r\nsocial developments, its internal struggle for organization; we have\r\nspeculated upon its moral and æsthetic condition, read its newspaper,\r\nmade an advanced criticism upon the lack of universality in its\r\nliterature, and attempted to imagine it at war. We have decided in\r\nparticular that unlike the civilized community of the immediate past\r\nwhich lived either in sharply-defined towns or agriculturally over a\r\nwide country, this population will be distributed in a quite different\r\nway, a little more thickly over vast urban regions and a little less\r\nthickly over less attractive or less convenient or less industrial parts\r\nof the world. And implicit in all that has been written there has\r\nappeared an unavoidable assumption that the coming community will be\r\nvast, something geographically more extensive than most, and\r\ngeographically different from almost all existing communities, that the\r\noutline its creative forces will draw not only does not coincide with\r\nexisting political centres and boundaries, but will be more often than\r\nnot in direct conflict with them, uniting areas that are separated and\r\nseparating areas that are united, grouping here half a dozen tongues and\r\npeoples together and there tearing apart homogeneous bodies and\r\ndistributing the fragments among separate groups. And it will now be\r\nwell to inquire a little into the general causes of these existing\r\ndivisions, the political boundaries of to-day, and the still older\r\ncontours of language and race.\r\n\r\nIt is first to be remarked that each of these sets of boundaries is\r\nsuperposed, as it were, on the older sets. The race areas, for example,\r\nwhich are now not traceable in Europe at all must have represented old\r\nregions of separation; the language areas, which have little or no\r\nessential relation to racial distribution, have also given way long\r\nsince to the newer forces that have united and consolidated nations. And\r\nthe still newer forces that have united and separated the nineteenth\r\ncentury states have been, and in many cases are still, in manifest\r\nconflict with \"national\" ideas.\r\n\r\nNow, in the original separation of human races, in the subsequent\r\ndifferentiation and spread of languages, in the separation of men into\r\nnationalities, and in the union and splitting of states and empires, we\r\nhave to deal essentially with the fluctuating manifestations of the\r\nsame fundamental shaping factor which will determine the distribution of\r\nurban districts in the coming years. Every boundary of the\r\nethnographical, linguistic, political, and commercial map--as a little\r\nconsideration will show--has indeed been traced in the first place by\r\nthe means of transit, under the compulsion of geographical contours.\r\n\r\nThere are evident in Europe four or five or more very distinct racial\r\ntypes, and since the methods and rewards of barbaric warfare and the\r\nnature of the chief chattels of barbaric trade have always been\r\ndiametrically opposed to racial purity, their original separation could\r\nonly have gone on through such an entire lack of communication as\r\nprevented either trade or warfare between the bulk of the\r\ndifferentiating bodies. These original racial types are now inextricably\r\nmingled. Unobservant, over-scholarly people talk or write in the\r\nprofoundest manner about a Teutonic race and a Keltic race, and\r\ninstitute all sorts of curious contrasts between these phantoms, but\r\nthese are not races at all, if physical characteristics have anything to\r\ndo with race. The Dane, the Bavarian, the Prussian, the Frieslander, the\r\nWessex peasant, the Kentish man, the Virginian, the man from New Jersey,\r\nthe Norwegian, the Swede, and the Transvaal Boer, are generalized about,\r\nfor example, as Teutonic, while the short, dark, cunning sort of\r\nWelshman, the tall and generous Highlander, the miscellaneous Irish,\r\nthe square-headed Breton, and any sort of Cornwall peasant are Kelts\r\nwithin the meaning of this oil-lamp anthropology.[44] People who believe\r\nin this sort of thing are not the sort of people that one attempts to\r\nconvert by a set argument. One need only say the thing is not so; there\r\nis no Teutonic race, and there never has been; there is no Keltic race,\r\nand there never has been. No one has ever proved or attempted to prove\r\nthe existence of such races, the thing has always been assumed; they are\r\ndogmas with nothing but questionable authority behind them, and the onus\r\nof proof rests on the believer. This nonsense about Keltic and Teutonic\r\nis no more science than Lombroso's extraordinary assertions about\r\ncriminals, or palmistry, or the development of religion from a solar\r\nmyth. Indisputably there are several races intermingled in the European\r\npopulations--I am inclined to suspect the primitive European races may\r\nbe found to be so distinct as to resist confusion and pamnyxia through\r\nhybridization--but there is no inkling of a satisfactory analysis yet\r\nthat will discriminate what these races were and define them in terms\r\nof physical and moral character. The fact remains there is no such thing\r\nas a racially pure and homogeneous community in Europe distinct from\r\nother communities. Even among the Jews, according to Erckert and Chantre\r\nand J. Jacobs, there are markedly divergent types, there may have been\r\ntwo original elements and there have been extensive local intermixtures.\r\n\r\nLong before the beginnings of history, while even language was in its\r\nfirst beginnings--indeed as another aspect of the same process as the\r\nbeginning of language--the first complete isolations that established\r\nrace were breaking down again, the little pools of race were running\r\ntogether into less homogeneous lagoons and marshes of humanity, the\r\nfirst paths were being worn--war paths for the most part. Still\r\ndifferentiation would be largely at work. Without frequent intercourse,\r\nfrequent interchange of women as the great factor in that intercourse,\r\nthe tribes and bands of mankind would still go on separating, would\r\ndevelop dialectic and customary, if not physical and moral differences.\r\nIt was no longer a case of pools perhaps, but they were still in lakes.\r\nThere were as yet no open seas of mankind. With advancing civilization,\r\nwith iron weapons and war discipline, with established paths and a\r\nsocial rule and presently with the coming of the horse, what one might\r\ncall the areas of assimilation would increase in size. A stage would be\r\nreached when the only checks to transit of a sufficiently convenient\r\nsort to keep language uniform would be the sea or mountains or a broad\r\nriver or--pure distance. And presently the rules of the game, so to\r\nspeak, would be further altered and the unifications and isolations that\r\nwere establishing themselves upset altogether and brought into novel\r\nconflict by the beginnings of navigation, whereby an impassable barrier\r\nbecame a highway.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of actual European history coincides with the closing\r\nphases of what was probably a very long period of a foot and\r\n(occasional) horseback state of communications; the adjustments so\r\narrived at being already in an early state of rearrangement through the\r\nadvent of the ship. The communities of Europe were still for the larger\r\npart small isolated tribes and kingdoms, such kingdoms as a mainly\r\npedestrian militia, or at any rate a militia without transport, and\r\ndrawn from (and soon drawn home again by) agricultural work, might hold\r\ntogether. The increase of transit facilities between such communities,\r\nby the development of shipping and the invention of the wheel and the\r\nmade road, spelt increased trade perhaps for a time, but very speedily a\r\nmore extensive form of war, and in the end either the wearing away of\r\ndifferences and union, or conquest. Man is the creature of a struggle\r\nfor existence, incurably egoistic and aggressive. Convince him of the\r\ngospel of self-abnegation even, and he instantly becomes its zealous\r\nmissionary, taking great credit that his expedients to ram it into the\r\nminds of his fellow-creatures do not include physical force--and if that\r\nis not self-abnegation, he asks, what is? So he has been, and so he is\r\nlikely to remain. Not to be so, is to die of abnegation and extinguish\r\nthe type. Improvement in transit between communities formerly for all\r\npractical purposes isolated, means, therefore, and always has meant, and\r\nI imagine, always will mean, that now they can get at one another. And\r\nthey do. They inter-breed and fight, physically, mentally, and\r\nspiritually. Unless Providence is belied in His works that is what they\r\nare meant to do.\r\n\r\nA third invention which, though not a means of transit like the wheeled\r\nvehicle and the ship, was yet a means of communication, rendered still\r\nlarger political reactions possible, and that was the development of\r\nsystems of writing. The first empires and some sort of written speech\r\narose together. Just as a kingdom, as distinguished from a mere tribal\r\ngroup of villages, is almost impossible without horses, so is an empire\r\nwithout writing and post-roads. The history of the whole world for three\r\nthousand years is the history of a unity larger than the small kingdom\r\nof the Heptarchy type, endeavouring to establish itself under the stress\r\nof these discoveries of horse-traffic and shipping and the written word,\r\nthe history, that is, of the consequences of the partial shattering of\r\nthe barriers that had been effectual enough to prevent the fusion of\r\nmore than tribal communities through all the long ages before the dawn\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nEast of the Gobi Pamir barrier there has slowly grown up under these new\r\nconditions the Chinese system. West and north of the Sahara Gobi barrier\r\nof deserts and mountains, the extraordinarily strong and spacious\r\nconceptions of the Romans succeeded in dominating the world, and do,\r\nindeed, in a sort of mutilated way, by the powers of great words and\r\nwide ideas, in Cæsarism and Imperialism, in the titles of Czar, Kaiser,\r\nand Imperator, in Papal pretension and countless political devices,\r\ndominate it to this hour. For awhile these conceptions sustained a\r\nunited and to a large extent organized empire over very much of this\r\nspace. But at its stablest time, this union was no more than a political\r\nunion, the spreading of a thin layer of Latin-speaking officials, of a\r\nthin network of roads and a very thin veneer indeed of customs and\r\nrefinements, over the scarcely touched national masses. It checked,\r\nperhaps, but it nowhere succeeded in stopping the slow but inevitable\r\ndifferentiation of province from province and nation from nation. The\r\nforces of transit that permitted the Roman imperialism and its partial\r\nsuccessors to establish wide ascendancies, were not sufficient to carry\r\nthe resultant unity beyond the political stage. There was unity, but not\r\nunification. Tongues and writing ceased to be pure without ceasing to\r\nbe distinct. Sympathies, religious and social practices, ran apart and\r\nrounded themselves off like drops of oil on water. Travel was restricted\r\nto the rulers and the troops and to a wealthy leisure class; commerce\r\nwas for most of the constituent provinces of the empire a commerce in\r\nsuperficialities, and each province--except for Italy, which latterly\r\nbecame dependent on an over-seas food supply--was in all essential\r\nthings autonomous, could have continued in existence, rulers and ruled,\r\narts, luxuries, and refinements just as they stood, if all other lands\r\nand customs had been swept out of being. Local convulsions and\r\nrevolutions, conquests and developments, occurred indeed, but though the\r\nstones were altered the mosaic remained, and the general size and\r\ncharacter of its constituent pieces remained. So it was under the\r\nRomans, so it was in the eighteenth century, and so it would probably\r\nhave remained as long as the post-road and the sailing-ship were the\r\nmost rapid forms of transit within the reach of man. Wars and powers and\r\nprinces came and went, that was all. Nothing was changed, there was only\r\none state the more or less. Even in the eighteenth century the process\r\nof real unification had effected so little, that not one of the larger\r\nkingdoms of Europe escaped a civil war--not a class war, but a really\r\n_internal_ war--between one part of itself and another, in that hundred\r\nyears. In spite of Rome's few centuries of unstable empire, internal\r\nwars, a perpetual struggle against finally triumphant disruption seemed\r\nto be the unavoidable destiny of every power that attempted to rule over\r\na larger radius than at most a hundred miles.\r\n\r\nSo evident was this that many educated English persons thought then, and\r\nmany who are not in the habit of analyzing operating causes, still think\r\nto-day, that the wide diffusion of the English-speaking people is a mere\r\npreliminary to their political, social, and linguistic disruption--the\r\neighteenth-century breach with the United States is made a precedent of,\r\nand the unification that followed the war of Union and the growing\r\nunification of Canada is overlooked--that linguistic differences,\r\ndifferences of custom, costume, prejudice, and the like, will finally\r\nmake the Australian, the Canadian of English blood, the Virginian, and\r\nthe English Africander, as incomprehensible and unsympathetic one to\r\nanother as Spaniard and Englishman or Frenchman and German are now. On\r\nsuch a supposition all our current Imperialism is the most foolish\r\ndefiance of the inevitable, the maddest waste of blood, treasure, and\r\nemotion that man ever made. So, indeed, it might be--so, indeed, I\r\ncertainly think it would be--if it were not that the epoch of post-road\r\nand sailing-ship is at an end. We are in the beginning of a new time,\r\nwith such forces of organization and unification at work in mechanical\r\ntraction, in the telephone and telegraph, in a whole wonderland of\r\nnovel, space-destroying appliances, and in the correlated inevitable\r\nadvance in practical education, as the world has never felt before.\r\n\r\nThe operation of these unifying forces is already to be very distinctly\r\ntraced in the check, the arrest indeed, of any further differentiation\r\nin existing tongues, even in the most widely spread. In fact, it is more\r\nthan an arrest even, the forces of differentiation have been driven back\r\nand an actual process of assimilation has set in. In England at the\r\ncommencement of the nineteenth century the common man of Somerset and\r\nthe common man of Yorkshire, the Sussex peasant, the Caithness cottar\r\nand the common Ulsterman, would have been almost incomprehensible to one\r\nanother. They differed in accent, in idiom, and in their very names for\r\nthings. They differed in their ideas about things. They were, in plain\r\nEnglish, foreigners one to another. Now they differ only in accent, and\r\neven that is a dwindling difference. Their language has become ampler\r\nbecause now they read. They read books--or, at any rate, they learn to\r\nread out of books--and certainly they read newspapers and those scrappy\r\nperiodicals that people like bishops pretend to think so detrimental to\r\nthe human mind, periodicals that it is cheaper to make at centres and\r\nuniformly, than locally in accordance with local needs. Since the\r\nnewspaper cannot fit the locality, the locality has to broaden its mind\r\nto the newspaper, and to ideas acceptable in other localities. The word\r\nand the idiom of the literary language and the pronunciation suggested\r\nby its spelling tends to prevail over the local usage. And moreover\r\nthere is a persistent mixing of peoples going on, migration in search of\r\nemployment and so on, quite unprecedented before the railways came. Few\r\npeople are content to remain in that locality and state of life \"into\r\nwhich it has pleased God to call them.\" As a result, dialectic purity\r\nhas vanished, dialects are rapidly vanishing, and novel differentiations\r\nare retarded or arrested altogether. Such novelties as do establish\r\nthemselves in a locality are widely disseminated almost at once in books\r\nand periodicals.\r\n\r\nA parallel arrest of dialectic separation has happened in France, in\r\nItaly, in Germany, and in the States. It is not a process peculiar to\r\nany one nation. It is simply an aspect of the general process that has\r\narisen out of mechanical locomotion. The organization of elementary\r\neducation has no doubt been an important factor, but the essential\r\ninfluence working through this circumstance is the fact that paper is\r\nrelatively cheap to type-setting, and both cheap to authorship--even the\r\ncommonest sorts of authorship--and the wider the area a periodical or\r\nbook serves the bigger, more attractive, and better it can be made for\r\nthe same money. And clearly this process of assimilation will continue.\r\nEven local differences of accent seem likely to follow. The itinerant\r\ndramatic company, the itinerant preacher, the coming extension of\r\ntelephones and the phonograph, which at any time in some application to\r\ncorrespondence or instruction may cease to be a toy, all these things\r\nattack, or threaten to attack, the weeds of differentiation before they\r\ncan take root....\r\n\r\nAnd this process is not restricted to dialects merely. The native of a\r\nsmall country who knows no other language than the tongue of his country\r\nbecomes increasingly at a disadvantage in comparison with the user of\r\nany of the three great languages of the Europeanized world. For his\r\nliterature he depends on the scanty writers who are in his own case and\r\nwrite, or have written, in his own tongue. Necessarily they are few,\r\nbecause necessarily with a small public there can be only subsistence\r\nfor a few. For his science he is in a worse case. His country can\r\nproduce neither teachers nor discoverers to compare with the numbers of\r\nsuch workers in the larger areas, and it will neither pay them to write\r\noriginal matter for his instruction nor to translate what has been\r\nwritten in other tongues. The larger the number of people reading a\r\ntongue, the larger--other things being equal--will be not only the\r\noutput of more or less original literature in that tongue, but also the\r\nmore profitable and numerous will be translations of whatever has value\r\nin other tongues. Moreover, the larger the reading public in any\r\nlanguage the cheaper will it be to supply copies of the desired work.\r\nIn the matter of current intelligence the case of the speaker of the\r\nsmall language is still worse. His newspaper will need to be cheaply\r\nserved, his home intelligence will be cut and restricted, his foreign\r\nnews belated and second hand. Moreover, to travel even a little distance\r\nor to conduct anything but the smallest business enterprise will be\r\nexceptionally inconvenient to him. The Englishman who knows no language\r\nbut his own may travel well-nigh all over the world and everywhere meet\r\nsome one who can speak his tongue. But what of the Welsh-speaking\r\nWelshman? What of the Basque and the Lithuanian who can speak only his\r\nmother tongue? Everywhere such a man is a foreigner and with all the\r\nforeigner's disadvantages. In most places he is for all practical\r\npurposes deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nThe inducements to an Englishman, Frenchman or German to become\r\nbi-lingual are great enough nowadays, but the inducements to a speaker\r\nof the smaller languages are rapidly approaching compulsion. He must do\r\nit in self-defence. To be an educated man in his own vernacular has\r\nbecome an impossibility, he must either become a mental subject of one\r\nof the greater languages or sink to the intellectual status of a\r\npeasant. But if our analysis of social development was correct the\r\npeasant of to-day will be represented to-morrow by the people of no\r\naccount whatever, the classes of extinction, the People of the Abyss.\r\nIf that analysis was correct, the essential nation will be all of\r\neducated men, that is to say, the essential nation will speak some\r\ndominant language or cease to exist, whatever its primordial tongue may\r\nhave been. It will pass out of being and become a mere local area of the\r\nlower social stratum,--a Problem for the philanthropic amateur.\r\n\r\nThe action of the force of attraction of the great tongues is\r\ncumulative. It goes on, as bodies fall, with a steady acceleration. The\r\nmore the great tongues prevail over the little languages the less will\r\nbe the inducement to write and translate into these latter, the less the\r\ninducement to master them with any care or precision. And so this attack\r\nupon the smaller tongues, this gravitation of those who are born to\r\nspeak them, towards the great languages, is not only to be seen going on\r\nin the case of such languages as Flemish, Welsh, or Basque, but even in\r\nthe case of Norwegian and of such a great and noble tongue as the\r\nItalian, I am afraid that the trend of things makes for a similar\r\nsuppression. All over Italy is the French newspaper and the French book.\r\nFrench wins its way more and more there, as English, I understand, is\r\ndoing in Norway, and English and German in Holland. And in the coming\r\nyears when the reading public will, in the case of the Western nations,\r\nbe practically the whole functional population, when travel will be more\r\nextensive and abundant, and the inter-change of printed matter still\r\ncheaper and swifter--and above all with the spread of the telephone--the\r\nprocess of subtle, bloodless, unpremeditated annexation will conceivably\r\nprogress much more rapidly even than it does at present. The Twentieth\r\nCentury will see the effectual crowding out of most of the weaker\r\nlanguages--if not a positive crowding out, yet at least (as in Flanders)\r\na supplementing of them by the superposition of one or other of a\r\nlimited number of world-languages over the area in which each is spoken.\r\nThis will go on not only in Europe, but with varying rates of progress\r\nand local eddies and interruptions over the whole world. Except in the\r\nspecial case of China and Japan, where there may be a unique\r\ndevelopment, the peoples of the world will escape from the wreckage of\r\ntheir too small and swamped and foundering social systems, only up the\r\nladders of what one may call the aggregating tongues.\r\n\r\nWhat will these aggregating world-languages be? If one has regard only\r\nto its extension during the nineteenth century one may easily incline to\r\noverrate the probabilities of English becoming the chief of these. But a\r\ngreat part of the vast extension of English that has occurred has been\r\ndue to the rapid reproduction of originally English-speaking peoples,\r\nthe emigration of foreigners into English-speaking countries in\r\nquantities too small to resist the contagion about them, and the\r\ncompulsion due to the political and commercial preponderance of a\r\npeople too illiterate to readily master strange tongues. None of these\r\ncauses have any essential permanence. When one comes to look more\r\nclosely into the question one is surprised to discover how slow the\r\nextension of English has been in the face of apparently far less\r\nconvenient tongues. English still fails to replace the French language\r\nin French Canada, and its ascendency is doubtful to-day in South Africa,\r\nafter nearly a century of British dominion. It has none of the\r\ncontagious quality of French, and the small class that monopolizes the\r\ndirection of British affairs, and probably will monopolize it yet for\r\nseveral decades, has never displayed any great zeal to propagate its\r\nuse. Of the few ideas possessed by the British governing class, the\r\ndestruction and discouragement of schools and colleges is,\r\nunfortunately, one of the chief, and there is an absolute incapacity to\r\nunderstand the political significance of the language question. The\r\nHindoo who is at pains to learn and use English encounters something\r\nuncommonly like hatred disguised in a facetious form. He will certainly\r\nread little about himself in English that is not grossly contemptuous,\r\nto reward him for his labour. The possibilities that have existed, and\r\nthat do still in a dwindling degree exist, for resolute statesmen to\r\nmake English the common language of communication for all Asia south and\r\neast of the Himalayas, will have to develop of their own force or\r\ndwindle and pass away. They may quite probably pass away. There is no\r\nsign that either the English or the Americans have a sufficient sense of\r\nthe importance of linguistic predominance in the future of their race to\r\ninterfere with natural processes in this matter for many years to come.\r\n\r\nAmong peoples not actually subject to British or American rule, and who\r\nare neither waiters nor commercial travellers, the inducements to learn\r\nEnglish, rather than French or German, do not increase. If our initial\r\nassumptions are right, the decisive factor in this matter is the amount\r\nof science and thought the acquisition of a language will afford the man\r\nwho learns it. It becomes, therefore, a fact of very great significance\r\nthat the actual number of books published in English is less than that\r\nin French or German, and that the proportion of serious books is very\r\ngreatly less. A large proportion of English books are novels adapted to\r\nthe minds of women, or of boys and superannuated business men, stories\r\ndesigned rather to allay than stimulate thought--they are the only\r\nbooks, indeed, that are profitable to publisher and author alike. In\r\nthis connection they do not count, however; no foreigner is likely to\r\nlearn English for the pleasure of reading Miss Marie Corelli in the\r\noriginal, or of drinking untranslatable elements from _The Helmet of\r\nNavarre_. The present conditions of book production for the English\r\nreading public offer no hope of any immediate change in this respect.\r\nThere is neither honour nor reward--there is not even food or\r\nshelter--for the American or Englishman who devotes a year or so of his\r\nlife to the adequate treatment of any spacious question, and so small is\r\nthe English reading public with any special interest in science, that a\r\ngreat number of important foreign scientific works are never translated\r\ninto English at all. Such interesting compilations as Bloch's work on\r\nwar, for example, must be read in French; in English only a brief\r\nsummary of his results is to be obtained, under a sensational\r\nheading.[45] Schopenhauer again is only to be got quite stupidly\r\nBowdlerized, explained, and \"selected\" in English. Many translations\r\nthat are made into English are made only to sell, they are too often the\r\nwork of sweated women and girls--very often quite without any special\r\nknowledge of the matter they translate--they are difficult to read and\r\nuntrustworthy to quote. The production of books in English, except the\r\nauthor be a wealthy amateur, rests finally upon the publishers, and\r\npublishers to-day stand a little lower than ordinary tradesmen in not\r\ncaring at all whether the goods they sell are good or bad. Unusual\r\nbooks, they allege--and all good books are unusual--are \"difficult to\r\nhandle,\" and the author must pay the fine--amounting, more often than\r\nnot, to the greater portion of his interest in the book. There is no\r\ncriticism to control the advertising enterprises of publishers and\r\nauthors, and no sufficiently intelligent reading public has\r\ndifferentiated out of the confusion to encourage attempts at critical\r\ndiscrimination. The organs of the great professions and technical trades\r\nare as yet not alive to the part their readers must play in the public\r\nlife of the future, and ignore all but strictly technical publications.\r\nA bastard criticism, written in many cases by publishers' employees, a\r\ncriticism having a very direct relation to the advertisement columns,\r\ndistributes praise and blame in the periodic press. There is no body of\r\ngreat men either in England or America, no intelligence in the British\r\nCourt, that might by any form of recognition compensate the\r\nphilosophical or scientific writer for poverty and popular neglect. The\r\nmore powerful a man's intelligence the more distinctly he must see that\r\nto devote himself to increase the scientific or philosophical wealth of\r\nthe English tongue will be to sacrifice comfort, the respect of the bulk\r\nof his contemporaries, and all the most delightful things of life, for\r\nthe barren reward of a not very certain righteous self-applause. By\r\nbrewing and dealing in tied houses,[46] or by selling pork and tea, or\r\nby stock-jobbing and by pandering with the profits so obtained to the\r\npleasures of the established great, a man of energy may hope to rise to\r\na pitch of public honour and popularity immeasurably in excess of\r\nanything attainable through the most splendid intellectual performances.\r\nHeaven forbid I should overrate public honours and the company of\r\nprinces! But it is not always delightful to be splashed by the wheels of\r\ncabs. Always before there has been at least a convention that the Court\r\nof this country, and its aristocracy, were radiant centres of moral and\r\nintellectual influence, that they did to some extent check and correct\r\nthe judgments of the cab-rank and the beer-house. But the British Crown\r\nof to-day, so far as it exists for science and literature at all, exists\r\nmainly to repudiate the claims of intellectual performance to public\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThese things, if they were merely the grievances of the study, might\r\nvery well rest there. But they must be recognized here because the\r\nintellectual decline of the published literature of the English\r\nlanguage--using the word to cover all sorts of books--involves finally\r\nthe decline of the language and of all the spacious political\r\npossibilities that go with the wide extension of a language.\r\nConceivably, if in the coming years a deliberate attempt were made to\r\nprovide sound instruction in English to all who sought it, and to all\r\nwithin the control of English-speaking Governments, if honour and\r\nemolument were given to literary men instead of being left to them to\r\nmost indelicately take, and if the present sordid trade of publishing\r\nwere so lifted as to bring the whole literature, the whole science, and\r\nall the contemporary thought of the world--not some selection of the\r\nworld's literature, not some obsolete Encyclopædia sold meanly and\r\nbasely to choke hungry minds, but a real publication of all that has\r\nbeen and is being done--within the reach of each man's need and desire\r\nwho had the franchise of the tongue, then by the year 2000 I would\r\nprophesy that the whole functional body of human society would read, and\r\nperhaps even write and speak, our language. And not only that, but it\r\nmight be the prevalent and everyday language of Scandinavia and Denmark\r\nand Holland, of all Africa, all North America, of the Pacific coasts of\r\nAsia and of India, the universal international language, and in a fair\r\nway to be the universal language of mankind. But such an enterprise\r\ndemands a resolve and intelligence beyond all the immediate signs of the\r\ntimes; it implies a veritable renascence of intellectual life among the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples. The probabilities of such a renascence will\r\nbe more conveniently discussed at a later stage, when we attempt to draw\r\nthe broad outline of the struggle for world-wide ascendency that the\r\ncoming years will see. But here it is clear that upon the probability of\r\nsuch a renascence depends the extension of the language, and not only\r\nthat, but the preservation of that military and naval efficiency upon\r\nwhich, in this world of resolute aggression, the existence of the\r\nEnglish-speaking communities finally depends.\r\n\r\nFrench and German will certainly be aggregating languages during the\r\ngreater portion of the coming years. Of the two I am inclined to think\r\nFrench will spread further than German. There is a disposition in the\r\nworld, which the French share, to grossly undervalue the prospects of\r\nall things French, derived, so far as I can gather, from the facts that\r\nthe French were beaten by the Germans in 1870, and that they do not\r\nbreed with the _abandon_ of rabbits or negroes. These are considerations\r\nthat affect the dissemination of French very little. The French reading\r\npublic is something different and very much larger than the existing\r\nFrench political system. The number of books published in French is\r\ngreater than that published in English; there is a critical reception\r\nfor a work published in French that is one of the few things worth a\r\nwriter's having, and the French translators are the most alert and\r\nefficient in the world. One has only to see a Parisian bookshop, and to\r\nrecall an English one, to realize the as yet unattainable standing of\r\nFrench. The serried ranks of lemon-coloured volumes in the former have\r\nthe whole range of human thought and interest; there are no taboos and\r\nno limits, you have everything up and down the scale, from frank\r\nindecency to stark wisdom. It is a shop for men. I remember my amazement\r\nto discover three copies of a translation of that most wonderful book,\r\nthe _Text-book of Psychology_ of Professor William James,[ERRATUM: for\r\n'The Text Book of Psychology,' _read_ 'The Principles of Psychology'.]\r\nin a shop in L'Avenue de l'Opera--three copies of a book that I have\r\nnever seen anywhere in England outside my own house,--and I am an\r\nattentive student of bookshop windows! And the French books are all so\r\npleasant in the page, and so cheap--they are for a people that buys to\r\nread. One thinks of the English bookshop, with its gaudy reach-me-downs\r\nof gilded and embossed cover, its horribly printed novels still more\r\nhorribly \"illustrated,\" the exasperating pointless variety in the size\r\nand thickness of its books. The general effect of the English book is\r\nthat it is something sold by a dealer in _bric-à-brac_, honestly sorry\r\nthe thing is a book, but who has done _his_ best to remedy it, anyhow!\r\nAnd all the English shopful is either brand new fiction or illustrated\r\ntravel (of '_Buns with the Grand Lama_' type), or gilded versions of the\r\nclassics of past times done up to give away. While the French bookshop\r\nreeks of contemporary intellectual life!\r\n\r\nThese things count for French as against English now, and they will\r\ncount for infinitely more in the coming years. And over German also\r\nFrench has many advantages. In spite of the numerical preponderance of\r\nbooks published in Germany, it is doubtful if the German reader has\r\nquite such a catholic feast before him as the reader of French. There is\r\na mass of German fiction probably as uninteresting to a foreigner as\r\npopular English and American romance. And German compared with French is\r\nan unattractive language; unmelodious, unwieldy, and cursed with a\r\nhideous and blinding lettering that the German is too patriotic to\r\nsacrifice. There has been in Germany a more powerful parallel to what\r\none may call the \"honest Saxon\" movement among the English, that queer\r\nmental twist that moves men to call an otherwise undistinguished preface\r\na \"Foreword,\" and find a pleasurable advantage over their\r\nfellow-creatures in a familiarity with \"eftsoons.\" This tendency in\r\nGerman has done much to arrest the simplification of idiom, and checked\r\nthe development of new words of classical origin. In particular it has\r\nstood in the way of the international use of scientific terms. The\r\nEnglishman, the Frenchman, and the Italian have a certain community of\r\ntechnical, scientific, and philosophical phraseology, and it is\r\nfrequently easier for an Englishman with some special knowledge of his\r\nsubject to read and appreciate a subtle and technical work in French,\r\nthan it is for him to fully enter into the popular matter of the same\r\ntongue. Moreover, the technicalities of these peoples, being not so\r\nimmediately and constantly brought into contrast and contact with their\r\nLatin or Greek roots as they would be if they were derived (as are so\r\nmany \"patriotic\" German technicalities) from native roots, are free to\r\nqualify and develop a final meaning distinct from their original\r\nintention. In the growing and changing body of science this counts for\r\nmuch. The indigenous German technicality remains clumsy and compromised\r\nby its everyday relations, to the end of time it drags a lengthening\r\nchain of unsuitable associations. And the shade of meaning, the limited\r\nqualification, that a Frenchman or Englishman can attain with a mere\r\ntwist of the sentence, the German must either abandon or laboriously\r\noverstate with some colossal wormcast of parenthesis.... Moreover,\r\nagainst the German tongue there are hostile frontiers, there are hostile\r\npeople who fear German preponderance, and who have set their hearts\r\nagainst its use. In Roumania, and among the Slav, Bohemian, and\r\nHungarian peoples, French attacks German in the flank, and has as clear\r\na prospect of predominance.\r\n\r\nThese two tongues must inevitably come into keen conflict; they will\r\nperhaps fight their battle for the linguistic conquest of Europe, and\r\nperhaps of the world, in a great urban region that will arise about the\r\nRhine. Politically this region lies now in six independent States, but\r\neconomically it must become one in the next fifty years. It will almost\r\ncertainly be the greatest urban region in all the world except that\r\nwhich will arise in the eastern States of North America, and that which\r\nmay arise somewhere about Hankow. It will stretch from Lille to Kiel, it\r\nwill drive extensions along the Rhine valley into Switzerland, and fling\r\nan arm along the Moldau to Prague, it will be the industrial capital of\r\nthe old world. Paris will be its West End, and it will stretch a\r\nspider's web of railways and great roads of the new sort over the whole\r\ncontinent. Even when the coal-field industries of the plain give place\r\nto the industrial application of mountain-born electricity, this great\r\ncity region will remain, I believe, in its present position at the\r\nseaport end of the great plain of the Old World. Considerations of\r\ntransit will keep it where it has grown, and electricity will be brought\r\nto it in mighty cables from the torrents of the central European\r\nmountain mass. Its westward port may be Bordeaux or Milford Haven, or\r\neven some port in the south-west of Ireland--unless, which is very\r\nunlikely, the velocity of secure sea-travel can be increased beyond that\r\nof land locomotion. I do not see how this great region is to unify\r\nitself without some linguistic compromise--the Germanization of the\r\nFrench-speaking peoples by force is too ridiculous a suggestion to\r\nentertain. Almost inevitably with travel, with transport communications,\r\nwith every condition of human convenience insisting upon it, formally or\r\ninformally a bi-lingual compromise will come into operation, and to my\r\nmind at least the chances seem even that French will emerge on the upper\r\nhand. Unless, indeed, that great renascence of the English-speaking\r\npeoples should, after all, so overwhelmingly occur as to force this\r\nEuropean city to be tri-lingual, and prepare the way by which the whole\r\nworld may at last speak together in one tongue.\r\n\r\nThese are the aggregating tongues. I do not think that any other tongues\r\nthan these are quite likely to hold their own in the coming time.\r\nItalian may flourish in the city of the Po valley, but only with French\r\nbeside it. Spanish and Russian are mighty languages, but without a\r\nreading public how can they prevail, and what prospect of a reading\r\npublic has either? They are, I believe, already judged. By A.D. 2000 all\r\nthese languages will be tending more and more to be the second tongues\r\nof bi-lingual communities, with French, or English, or less probably\r\nGerman winning the upper hand.\r\n\r\nBut when one turns to China there are the strangest possibilities. It is\r\nin Eastern Asia alone that there seems to be any possibility of a\r\nsynthesis sufficiently great to maintain itself, arising outside of,\r\nand independently of, the interlocked system of mechanically sustained\r\nsocieties that is developing out of mediæval Christendom. Throughout\r\nEastern Asia there is still, no doubt, a vast wilderness of languages,\r\nbut over them all rides the Chinese writing. And very strong--strong\r\nenough to be very gravely considered--is the possibility of that writing\r\ntaking up an orthodox association of sounds, and becoming a world\r\nspeech. The Japanese written language, the language of Japanese\r\nliterature, tends to assimilate itself to Chinese, and fresh Chinese\r\nwords and expressions are continually taking root in Japan. The Japanese\r\nare a people quite abnormal and incalculable, with a touch of romance, a\r\nconception of honour, a quality of imagination, and a clearness of\r\nintelligence that renders possible for them things inconceivable of any\r\nother existing nation. I may be the slave of perspective effects, but\r\nwhen I turn my mind from the pettifogging muddle of the English House of\r\nCommons, for example, that magnified vestry that is so proud of itself\r\nas a club--when I turn from that to this race of brave and smiling\r\npeople, abruptly destiny begins drawing with a bolder hand. Suppose the\r\nJapanese were to make up their minds to accelerate whatever process of\r\nsynthesis were possible in China! Suppose, after all, I am not the\r\nvictim of atmospheric refraction, and they are, indeed, as gallant and\r\nbold and intelligent as my baseless conception of them would have them\r\nbe! They would almost certainly find co-operative elements among the\r\neducated Chinese.... But this is no doubt the lesser probability. In\r\nfront and rear of China the English language stands. It has the start of\r\nall other languages--the mechanical advantage--the position. And if only\r\nwe, who think and write and translate and print and put forth, could\r\nmake it worth the world's having!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] Under the intoxication of the Keltic Renascence the most diverse\r\nsorts of human beings have foregathered and met face to face, and been\r\nphotographed Pan-Keltically, and have no doubt gloated over these\r\ncollective photographs, without any of them realizing, it seems, what a\r\nmiscellaneous thing the Keltic race must be. There is nothing that may\r\nor may not be a Kelt, and I know, for example, professional Kelts who\r\nare, so far as face, manners, accents, morals, and ideals go,\r\nindistinguishable from other people who are, I am told, indisputably\r\nAssyroid Jews.\r\n\r\n[45] _Is War Now Impossible?_ and see also footnote, p. 210.\r\n\r\n[46] It is entirely for their wealth that brewers have been ennobled in\r\nEngland, never because of their services as captains of a great\r\nindustry. Indeed, these services have been typically poor. While these\r\nmen were earning their peerages by the sort of proceedings that do\r\nsecure men peerages under the British Crown, the German brewers were\r\ndeveloping the art and science of brewing with remarkable energy and\r\nsuccess. The Germans and Bohemians can now make light beers that the\r\nEnglish brewers cannot even imitate; they are exporting beer to England\r\nin steadily increasing volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE LARGER SYNTHESIS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the essential process arising out of the growth of\r\nscience and mechanism, and more particularly out of the still developing\r\nnew facilities of locomotion and communication science has afforded, is\r\nthe deliquescence of the social organizations of the past, and the\r\nsynthesis of ampler and still ampler and more complicated and still more\r\ncomplicated social unities. The suggestion is powerful, the conclusion\r\nis hard to resist, that, through whatever disorders of danger and\r\nconflict, whatever centuries of misunderstanding and bloodshed, men may\r\nstill have to pass, this process nevertheless aims finally, and will\r\nattain to the establishment of one world-state at peace within itself.\r\nIn the economic sense, indeed, a world-state is already established.\r\nEven to-day we do all buy and sell in the same markets--albeit the\r\nowners of certain ancient rights levy their tolls here and there--and\r\nthe Hindoo starves, the Italian feels the pinch, before the Germans or\r\nthe English go short of bread. There is no real autonomy any more in\r\nthe world, no simple right to an absolute independence such as formerly\r\nthe Swiss could claim. The nations and boundaries of to-day do no more\r\nthan mark claims to exemptions, privileges, and corners in the\r\nmarket--claims valid enough to those whose minds and souls are turned\r\ntowards the past, but absurdities to those who look to the future as the\r\nend and justification of our present stresses. The claim to political\r\nliberty amounts, as a rule, to no more than the claim of a man to live\r\nin a parish without observing sanitary precautions or paying rates\r\nbecause he had an excellent great-grandfather. Against all these old\r\nisolations, these obsolescent particularisms, the forces of mechanical\r\nand scientific development fight, and fight irresistibly; and upon the\r\ngeneral recognition of this conflict, upon the intelligence and courage\r\nwith which its inflexible conditions are negotiated, depends very\r\nlargely the amount of bloodshed and avoidable misery the coming years\r\nwill hold.\r\n\r\nThe final attainment of this great synthesis, like the social\r\ndeliquescence and reconstruction dealt with in the earlier of these\r\nanticipations, has an air of being a process independent of any\r\ncollective or conscious will in man, as being the expression of a\r\ngreater Will; it is working now, and may work out to its end vastly, and\r\nyet at times almost imperceptibly, as some huge secular movement in\r\nNature, the raising of a continent, the crumbling of a mountain-chain,\r\ngoes on to its appointed culmination. Or one may compare the process to\r\na net that has surrounded, and that is drawn continually closer and\r\ncloser upon, a great and varied multitude of men. We may cherish\r\nanimosities, we may declare imperishable distances, we may plot and\r\ncounter-plot, make war and \"fight to a finish;\" the net tightens for all\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAlready the need of some synthesis at least ampler than existing\r\nnational organizations is so apparent in the world, that at least five\r\nspacious movements of coalescence exist to-day; there is the movement\r\ncalled Anglo-Saxonism, the allied but finally very different movement of\r\nBritish Imperialism, the Pan-Germanic movement, Pan-Slavism, and the\r\nconception of a great union of the \"Latin\" peoples. Under the outrageous\r\ntreatment of the white peoples an idea of unifying the \"Yellow\" peoples\r\nis pretty certain to become audibly and visibly operative before many\r\nyears. These are all deliberate and justifiable suggestions, and they\r\nall aim to sacrifice minor differences in order to link like to like in\r\ngreater matters, and so secure, if not physical predominance in the\r\nworld, at least an effective defensive strength for their racial, moral,\r\ncustomary, or linguistic differences against the aggressions of other\r\npossible coalescences. But these syntheses or other similar synthetic\r\nconceptions, if they do not contrive to establish a rational social\r\nunity by sanely negotiated unions, will be forced to fight for physical\r\npredominance in the world. The whole trend of forces in the world is\r\nagainst the preservation of _local_ social systems however greatly and\r\nspaciously conceived. Yet it is quite possible that several or all of\r\nthe cultures that will arise out of the development of these\r\nPan-this-and-that movements may in many of their features survive, as\r\nthe culture of the Jews has survived, political obliteration, and may\r\ndisseminate themselves, as the Jewish system has disseminated itself,\r\nover the whole world-city. Unity by no means involves homogeneity. The\r\ngreater the social organism the more complex and varied its parts, the\r\nmore intricate and varied the interplay of culture and breed and\r\ncharacter within it.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if either the Latin or the Pan-Slavic idea contains the\r\npromise of any great political unification. The elements of the Latin\r\nsynthesis are dispersed in South and Central America and about the\r\nMediterranean basin in a way that offers no prospect of an economic\r\nunity between them. The best elements of the French people lie in the\r\nwestern portion of what must become the greatest urban region of the Old\r\nWorld, the Rhine-Netherlandish region; the interests of North Italy draw\r\nthat region away from the Italy of Rome and the South towards the Swiss\r\nand South Germany, and the Spanish and Portuguese speaking halfbreeds\r\nof South America have not only their own coalescences to arrange, but\r\nthey lie already under the political tutelage of the United States.\r\nNowhere except in France and North Italy is there any prospect of such\r\nan intellectual and educational evolution as is necessary before a great\r\nscheme of unification can begin to take effect. And the difficulties in\r\nthe way of the pan-Slavic dream are far graver. Its realization is\r\nenormously hampered by the division of its languages, and the fact that\r\nin the Bohemian language, in Polish and in Russian, there exist distinct\r\nliteratures, almost equally splendid in achievement, but equally\r\ninsufficient in quantity and range to establish a claim to replace all\r\nother Slavonic dialects. Russia, which should form the central mass of\r\nthis synthesis, stagnates, relatively to the Western states, under the\r\nrule of reactionary intelligences; it does not develop, and does not\r\nseem likely to develop, the merest beginnings of that great educated\r\nmiddle class, with which the future so enormously rests. The Russia of\r\nto-day is indeed very little more than a vast breeding-ground for an\r\nilliterate peasantry, and the forecasts of its future greatness entirely\r\nignore that dwindling significance of mere numbers in warfare which is\r\nthe clear and necessary consequence of mechanical advance. To a large\r\nextent, I believe, the Western Slavs will follow the Prussians and\r\nLithuanians, and be incorporated in the urbanization of Western Europe,\r\nand the remoter portions of Russia seem destined to become--are indeed\r\nbecoming--Abyss, a wretched and disorderly Abyss that will not even be\r\nformidable to the armed and disciplined peoples of the new civilization,\r\nthe last quarter of the earth, perhaps, where a barbaric or absentee\r\nnobility will shadow the squalid and unhappy destinies of a multitude of\r\nhopeless and unmeaning lives.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, Russia may play the part of a vaster Ireland, in\r\nher failure to keep pace with the educational and economic progress of\r\nnations which have come into economic unity with her. She will be an\r\nIreland without emigration, a place for famines. And while Russia delays\r\nto develop anything but a fecund orthodoxy and this simple peasant life,\r\nthe grooves and channels are growing ever deeper along which the\r\ncurrents of trade, of intellectual and moral stimulus, must presently\r\nflow towards the West. I see no region where anything like the\r\ncomparatively dense urban regions that are likely to arise about the\r\nRhineland and over the eastern states of America, for example, can\r\ndevelop in Russia. With railways planned boldly, it would have been\r\npossible, it might still be possible, to make about Odessa a parallel to\r\nChicago, but the existing railways run about Odessa as though Asia were\r\nunknown; and when at last the commercial awakening of what is now the\r\nTurkish Empire comes, the railway lines will probably run, not north or\r\nsouth, but from the urban region of the more scientific central\r\nEuropeans down to Constantinople. The long-route land communications in\r\nthe future will become continually more swift and efficient than Baltic\r\nnavigation, and it is unlikely, therefore, that St. Petersburg has any\r\ngreat possibilities of growth. It was founded by a man whose idea of the\r\ncourse of trade and civilization was the sea wholly and solely, and in\r\nthe future the sea must necessarily become more and more a last resort.\r\nWith its spacious prospects, its architectural magnificence, its\r\npolitical quality, its desertion by the new commerce, and its terrible\r\npeasant hinterland, it may come about that a striking analogy between\r\nSt. Petersburg and Dublin will finally appear.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Pan-Slavic synthesis. It seems improbable that it can\r\nprevail against the forces that make for the linguistic and economic\r\nannexation of the greater part of European Russia and of the minor\r\nSlavonic masses, to the great Western European urban region.\r\n\r\nThe political centre of gravity of Russia, in its resistance to these\r\neconomic movements, is palpably shifting eastward even to-day, but that\r\ncarries it away from the Central European synthesis only towards the\r\nvastly more enormous attracting centre of China. Politically the Russian\r\nGovernment may come to dominate China in the coming decades, but the\r\nreality beneath any such formal predominance will be the absorption of\r\nRussia beyond the range of the European pull by the synthesis of Eastern\r\nAsia. Neither the Russian literature nor the Russian language and\r\nwriting, nor the Russian civilization as a whole have the qualities to\r\nmake them irresistible to the energetic and intelligent millions of the\r\nfar East. The chances seem altogether against the existence of a great\r\nSlavonic power in the world at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. They seem, at the first glance, to lie just as heavily in\r\nfavour of an aggressive Pan-Germanic power struggling towards a great\r\nand commanding position athwart Central Europe and Western Asia, and\r\nturning itself at last upon the defeated Slavonic disorder. There can be\r\nno doubt that at present the Germans, with the doubtful exception of the\r\nUnited States, have the most efficient middle class in the world, their\r\nrapid economic progress is to a very large extent, indeed, a triumph of\r\nintelligence, and their political and probably their military and naval\r\nservices are still conducted with a capacity and breadth of view that\r\nfind no parallel in the world. But the very efficiency of the German as\r\na German to-day, and the habits and traditions of victory he has\r\naccumulated for nearly forty years, may prove in the end a very doubtful\r\nblessing to Europe as a whole, or even to his own grandchildren.\r\nGeographical contours, economic forces, the trend of invention and\r\nsocial development, point to a unification of all Western Europe, but\r\nthey certainly do not point to its Germanization. I have already given\r\nreasons for anticipating that the French language may not only hold its\r\nown, but prevail against German in Western Europe. And there are certain\r\nother obstacles in the way even of the union of indisputable Germans.\r\nOne element in Germany's present efficiency must become more and more of\r\nan encumbrance as the years pass. The Germanic idea is deeply interwoven\r\nwith the traditional Empire and with the martinet methods of the\r\nPrussian monarchy. The intellectual development of the Germans is\r\ndefined to a very large extent by a court-directed officialdom. In many\r\nthings that court is still inspired by the noble traditions of education\r\nand discipline that come from the days of German adversity, and the\r\npredominance of the Imperial will does, no doubt, give a unity of\r\npurpose to German policy and action that adds greatly to its efficacy.\r\nBut for a capable ruler, even more than for a radiantly stupid monarch,\r\nthe price a nation must finally pay is heavy. Most energetic and capable\r\npeople are a little intolerant of unsympathetic capacity, are apt on the\r\nunder side of their egotism to be jealous, assertive, and aggressive. In\r\nthe present Empire of Germany there are no other great figures to\r\nbalance the Imperial personage, and I do not see how other great figures\r\nare likely to arise. A great number of fine and capable persons must be\r\nfailing to develop, failing to tell, under the shadow of this too\r\nprepotent monarchy. There are certain limiting restrictions imposed upon\r\nGermans through the Imperial activity, that must finally be bad for the\r\nintellectual atmosphere which is Germany's ultimate strength. For\r\nexample, the Emperor professes a violent and grotesque Christianity with\r\na ferocious pro-Teutonic Father and a negligible Son, and the public\r\nmind is warped into conformity with the finally impossible cant of this\r\neccentric creed. His Imperial Majesty's disposition to regard criticism\r\nas hostility stifles the public thought of Germany. He interferes in\r\nuniversity affairs and in literary and artistic matters with a quite\r\nremarkable confidence and incalculable consequences. The inertia of a\r\ncentury carries him and his Germany onward from success to success, but\r\nfor all that one may doubt whether the extraordinary intellectuality\r\nthat distinguished the German atmosphere in the early years of the\r\ncentury, and in which such men as Blumenthal and Moltke grew to\r\ngreatness, in which Germany grew to greatness, is not steadily fading in\r\nthe heat and blaze of the Imperial sunshine. Discipline and education\r\nhave carried Germany far; they are essential things, but an equally\r\nessential need for the coming time is a free play for men of initiative\r\nand imagination. Is Germany to her utmost possibility making capable\r\nmen? That, after all, is the vital question, and not whether her policy\r\nis wise or foolish, or her commercial development inflated or sound. Or\r\nis Germany doing no more than cash the promises of those earlier days?\r\n\r\nAfter all, I do not see that she is in a greatly stronger position than\r\nwas France in the early sixties, and, indeed, in many respects her\r\npresent predominance is curiously analogous to that of the French Empire\r\nin those years. Death at any time may end the career of the present\r\nruler of Germany--there is no certain insurance of one single life. This\r\nwithdrawal would leave Germany organized entirely with reference to a\r\nCourt, and there is no trustworthy guarantee that the succeeding Royal\r\nPersonality may not be something infinitely more vain and aggressive, or\r\nsomething weakly self-indulgent or unpatriotic and morally indifferent.\r\nMuch has been done in the past of Germany, the infinitely less exacting\r\npast, by means of the tutor, the Chamberlain, the Chancellor, the\r\nwide-seeing power beyond the throne, who very unselfishly intrigues his\r\nmonarch in the way that he should go. But that sort of thing is\r\nremarkably like writing a letter by means of a pen held in lazy tongs\r\ninstead of the hand. A very easily imagined series of accidents may\r\nplace the destinies of Germany in such lazy tongs again. When that\r\noccasion comes, will the new class of capable men on which we have\r\nconvinced ourselves in these anticipations the future depends--will it\r\nbe ready for its enlarged responsibilities, or will the flower of its\r\npossible members be in prison for _lèse majesté_, or naturalized\r\nEnglishmen or naturalized Americans or troublesome privates under\r\nofficers of indisputably aristocratic birth, or well-broken labourers,\r\nwon \"back to the land,\" under the auspices of an Agrarian League?\r\n\r\nIn another way the intensely monarchical and aristocratic organization\r\nof the German Empire will stand in the way of the political synthesis of\r\ngreater Germany. Indispensable factors in that synthesis will be Holland\r\nand Switzerland--little, advantageously situated peoples, saturated with\r\nideas of personal freedom. One can imagine a German Swiss, at any rate,\r\nmerging himself in a great Pan-Germanic republican state, but to bow the\r\nknee to the luridly decorated God of His Imperial Majesty's Fathers will\r\nbe an altogether more difficult exploit for a self-respecting man....\r\n\r\nMoreover, before Germany can unify to the East she must fight the\r\nRussian, and to unify to the West she must fight the French and perhaps\r\nthe English, and she may have to fight a combination of these powers. I\r\nthink the military strength of France is enormously underrated. Upon\r\nthis matter M. Bloch should be read. Indisputably the French were beaten\r\nin 1870, indisputably they have fallen behind in their long struggle to\r\nmaintain themselves equal with the English on the sea, but neither of\r\nthese things efface the future of the French. The disasters of 1870 were\r\nprobably of the utmost benefit to the altogether too sanguine French\r\nimagination. They cleared the French mind of the delusion that personal\r\nImperialism is the way to do the desirable thing, a delusion many\r\nGermans (and, it would seem, a few queer Englishmen and still queerer\r\nAmericans) entertain. The French have done much to demonstrate the\r\npossibility of a stable military republic. They have disposed of crown\r\nand court, and held themselves in order for thirty good years; they have\r\ndissociated their national life from any form of religious profession;\r\nthey have contrived a freedom of thought and writing that, in spite of\r\nmuch conceit to the contrary, is quite impossible among the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples. I find no reason to doubt the implication of\r\nM. Bloch that on land to-day the French are relatively far stronger than\r\nthey were in 1870, that the evolution of military expedients has been\r\nall in favour of the French character and intelligence, and that even a\r\nsingle-handed war between France and Germany to-day might have a very\r\ndifferent issue from that former struggle. In such a conflict it will be\r\nGermany, and not France, that will have pawned her strength to the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples on the high seas. And France will not fight\r\nalone. She will fight for Switzerland or Luxembourg, or the mouth of the\r\nRhine. She will fight with the gravity of remembered humiliations, with\r\nthe whole awakened Slav-race at the back of her antagonist, and very\r\nprobably with the support of the English-speaking peoples.\r\n\r\nIt must be pointed out how strong seems the tendency of the German\r\nEmpire to repeat the history of Holland upon a larger scale. While the\r\nDutch poured out all their strength upon the seas, in a conflict with\r\nthe English that at the utmost could give them only trade, they let the\r\npossibilities of a great Low German synthesis pass utterly out of being.\r\n(In those days Low Germany stretched to Arras and Douay.) They\r\npositively dragged the English into the number of their enemies. And\r\nto-day the Germans invade the sea with a threat and intention that will\r\ncertainly create a countervailing American navy, fundamentally modify\r\nthe policy of Great Britain, such as it is, and very possibly go far to\r\neffect the synthesis of the English-speaking peoples.\r\n\r\nSo involved, I do not see that the existing Germanic synthesis is likely\r\nto prevail in the close economic unity, the urban region that will arise\r\nin Western Europe. I imagine that the German Empire--that is, the\r\norganized expression of German aggression to-day--will be either\r\nshattered or weakened to the pitch of great compromises by a series of\r\nwars by land and sea; it will be forced to develop the autonomy of its\r\nrational middle class in the struggles that will render these\r\ncompromises possible, and it will be finally not Imperial German ideas,\r\nbut central European ideas possibly more akin to Swiss conceptions, a\r\ncivilized republicanism finding its clearest expression in the French\r\nlanguage, that will be established upon a bilingual basis throughout\r\nWestern Europe, and increasingly predominant over the whole European\r\nmainland and the Mediterranean basin, as the twentieth century closes.\r\nThe splendid dream of a Federal Europe, which opened the nineteenth\r\ncentury for France, may perhaps, after all, come to something like\r\nrealization at the opening of the twenty-first. But just how long these\r\nthings take, just how easily or violently they are brought about,\r\ndepends, after all, entirely upon the rise in general intelligence in\r\nEurope. An ignorant, a merely trained or a merely cultured people, will\r\nnot understand these coalescences, will fondle old animosities and stage\r\nhatreds, and for such a people there must needs be disaster, forcible\r\nconformities and war. Europe will have her Irelands as well as her\r\nScotlands, her Irelands of unforgettable wrongs, kicking, squalling,\r\nbawling most desolatingly, for nothing that any one can understand.\r\nThere will be great scope for the shareholding dilettanti, great\r\nopportunities for literary quacks, in \"national\" movements, language\r\nleagues, picturesque plotting, and the invention of such \"national\"\r\ncostumes as the world has never seen. The cry of the little nations\r\nwill go up to heaven, asserting the inalienable right of all little\r\nnations to sit down firmly in the middle of the high-road, in the midst\r\nof the thickening traffic, and with all their dear little toys about\r\nthem, play and play--just as they used to play before the road had\r\ncome....\r\n\r\nAnd while the great states of the continent of Europe are hammering down\r\ntheir obstructions of language and national tradition or raising the\r\neducational level above them until a working unity is possible, and\r\nwhile the reconstruction of Eastern Asia--whether that be under Russian,\r\nJapanese, English, or native Chinese direction--struggles towards\r\nattainment, will there also be a great synthesis of the English-speaking\r\npeoples going on? I am inclined to believe that there will be such a\r\nsynthesis, and that the head and centre of the new unity will be the\r\ngreat urban region that is developing between Chicago and the Atlantic,\r\nand which will lie mainly, but not entirely, south of the St. Lawrence.\r\nInevitably, I think, that region must become the intellectual,\r\npolitical, and industrial centre of any permanent unification of the\r\nEnglish-speaking states. There will, I believe, develop about that\r\ncentre a great federation of white English-speaking peoples, a\r\nfederation having America north of Mexico as its central mass (a\r\nfederation that may conceivably include Scandinavia) and its federal\r\ngovernment will sustain a common fleet, and protect or dominate or\r\nactually administer most or all of the non-white states of the present\r\nBritish Empire, and in addition much of the South and Middle Pacific,\r\nthe East and West Indies, the rest of America, and the larger part of\r\nblack Africa. Quite apart from the dominated races, such an\r\nEnglish-speaking state should have by the century-end a practically\r\nhomogeneous citizenship of at least a hundred million sound-bodied and\r\neducated and capable _men_. It should be the first of the three powers\r\nof the world, and it should face the organizing syntheses of Europe and\r\nEastern Asia with an intelligent sympathy. By the year 2000 all its\r\ncommon citizens should certainly be in touch with the thought of\r\nContinental Europe through the medium of French; its English language\r\nshould be already rooting firmly through all the world beyond its\r\nconfines, and its statesmanship should be preparing openly and surely,\r\nand discussing calmly with the public mind of the European, and probably\r\nof the Yellow state, the possible coalescences and conventions, the\r\nobliteration of custom-houses, the homologization of laws and coinage\r\nand measures, and the mitigation of monopolies and special claims, by\r\nwhich the final peace of the world may be assured for ever. Such a\r\nsynthesis, at any rate, of the peoples now using the English tongue, I\r\nregard not only as a possible, but as a probable, thing. The positive\r\nobstacles to its achievement, great though they are, are yet trivial in\r\ncomparison with the obstructions to that lesser European synthesis we\r\nhave ventured to forecast. The greater obstacle is negative, it lies in\r\nthe want of stimulus, in the lax prosperity of most of the constituent\r\nstates of such a union. But such a stimulus, the renascence of Eastern\r\nAsia, or a great German fleet upon the ocean, may presently supply.\r\n\r\nNow, all these three great coalescences, this shrivelling up and\r\nvanishing of boundary lines, will be the outward and visible\r\naccompaniment of that inward and social reorganization which it is the\r\nmain object of these Anticipations to display. I have sought to show\r\nthat in peace and war alike a process has been and is at work, a process\r\nwith all the inevitableness and all the patience of a natural force,\r\nwhereby the great swollen, shapeless, hypertrophied social mass of\r\nto-day must give birth at last to a naturally and informally organized,\r\neducated class, an unprecedented sort of people, a New Republic\r\ndominating the world. It will be none of our ostensible governments that\r\nwill effect this great clearing up; it will be the mass of power and\r\nintelligence altogether outside the official state systems of to-day\r\nthat will make this great clearance, a new social Hercules that will\r\nstrangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle.\r\n\r\nNow, the more one descends from the open uplands of wide generalization\r\nto the parallel jungle of particulars, the more dangerous does the road\r\nof prophesying become, yet nevertheless there may be some possibility of\r\nspeculating how, in the case of the English-speaking synthesis at least,\r\nthis effective New Republic may begin visibly to shape itself out and\r\nappear. It will appear first, I believe, as a conscious organization of\r\nintelligent and quite possibly in some cases wealthy men, as a movement\r\nhaving distinct social and political aims, confessedly ignoring most of\r\nthe existing apparatus of political control, or using it only as an\r\nincidental implement in the attainment of these aims. It will be very\r\nloosely organized in its earlier stages, a mere movement of a number of\r\npeople in a certain direction, who will presently discover with a sort\r\nof surprise the common object towards which they are all moving.\r\n\r\nAlready there are some interesting aspects of public activity that,\r\ndiverse though their aims may seem, do nevertheless serve to show the\r\npossible line of development of this New Republic in the coming time.\r\nFor example, as a sort of preliminary sigh before the stirring of a\r\nlarger movement, there are various Anglo-American movements and leagues\r\nto be noted. Associations for entertaining travelling samples of the\r\nAmerican leisure class in guaranteed English country houses, for\r\nbringing them into momentary physical contact with real titled persons\r\nat lunches and dinners, and for having them collectively lectured by\r\nrespectable English authors and divines, are no doubt trivial things\r\nenough; but a snob sometimes shows how the wind blows better than a\r\nserious man. The Empire may catch the American as the soldier caught the\r\nTartar. There is something very much more spacious than such things as\r\nthis, latent in both the British and the American mind, and observable,\r\nfor instance, in the altered tone of the Presses of both countries since\r\nthe Venezuela Message and the Spanish American War. Certain projects of\r\na much ampler sort have already been put forward. An interesting\r\nproposal of an interchangeable citizenship, so that with a change of\r\ndomicile an Englishman should have the chance of becoming a citizen of\r\nthe United States, and an American a British citizen or a voter in an\r\nautonomous British colony, for example, has been made. Such schemes\r\nwill, no doubt, become frequent, and will afford much scope for\r\ndiscussion in both countries during the next decade or so.[47] The\r\nAmerican constitution and the British crown and constitution have to be\r\nmodified or shelved at some stage in this synthesis, and for certain\r\ntypes of intelligence there could be no more attractive problem. Certain\r\ncurious changes in the colonial point of view will occur as these\r\ndiscussions open out. The United States of America are rapidly taking,\r\nor have already taken, the ascendency in the iron and steel and\r\nelectrical industries out of the hands of the British; they are\r\ndeveloping a far ampler and more thorough system of higher scientific\r\neducation than the British, and the spirit of efficiency percolating\r\nfrom their more efficient businesses is probably higher in their public\r\nservices. These things render the transfer of the present mercantile and\r\nnaval ascendency of Great Britain to the United States during the next\r\ntwo or three decades a very probable thing, and when this is\r\naccomplished the problem how far colonial loyalty is the fruit of Royal\r\nVisits and sporadic knighthoods, and how far it has relation to the\r\nexistence of a predominant fleet, will be near its solution. An\r\ninteresting point about such discussions as this, in which indeed in all\r\nprobability the nascent consciousness of the New Republic will emerge,\r\nwill be the solution this larger synthesis will offer to certain\r\nmiserable difficulties of the present time. Government by the elect of\r\nthe first families of Great Britain has in the last hundred years made\r\nIreland and South Africa two open sores of irreconcilable wrong. These\r\ntwo English-speaking communities will never rest and never emerge from\r\nwretchedness under the vacillating vote-catching incapacity of British\r\nImperialism, and it is impossible that the British power, having\r\nembittered them, should ever dare to set them free. But within such an\r\nampler synthesis as the New Republic will seek, these states could\r\nemerge to an equal fellowship that would take all the bitterness from\r\ntheir unforgettable past.\r\n\r\nAnother type of public activity which foreshadows an aspect under which\r\nthe New Republic will emerge is to be found in the unofficial\r\norganizations that have come into existence in Great Britain to watch\r\nand criticize various public departments. There is, for example, the\r\nNavy League, a body of intelligent and active persons with a distinctly\r\nexpert qualification which has intervened very effectively in naval\r\ncontrol during the last few years. There is also at present a vast\r\namount of disorganized but quite intelligent discontent with the tawdry\r\nfutilities of army reform that occupy the War Office. It becomes\r\napparent that there is no hope of a fully efficient and well-equipped\r\nofficial army under parliamentary government, and with that realization\r\nthere will naturally appear a disposition to seek some way to military\r\nefficiency, as far as is legally possible, outside War Office control.\r\nAlready recruiting is falling off, it will probably fall off more and\r\nmore as the patriotic emotions evoked by the Boer War fade away, and no\r\ntrivial addition to pay or privilege will restore it. Elementary\r\neducation has at last raised the intelligence of the British lower\r\nclasses to a point when the prospect of fighting in distant lands under\r\nunsuitably educated British officers of means and gentility with a\r\ndefective War Office equipment and inferior weapons has lost much of its\r\nromantic glamour. But an unofficial body that set itself to the\r\nestablishment of a school of military science, to the sane organization\r\nand criticism of military experiments in tactics and equipment, and to\r\nthe raising for experimental purposes of volunteer companies and\r\nbattalions, would find no lack of men.... What an unofficial syndicate\r\nof capable persons of the new sort may do in these matters has been\r\nshown in the case of the _Turbinia_, the germ of an absolute revolution\r\nin naval construction.\r\n\r\nSuch attempts at unofficial soldiering would be entirely in the spirit\r\nin which I believe the New Republic will emerge, but it is in another\r\nline of activity that the growing new consciousness will presently be\r\nmuch more distinctly apparent. It is increasingly evident that to\r\norganize and control public education is beyond the power of a\r\ndemocratic government. The meanly equipped and pretentiously conducted\r\nprivate schools of Great Britain, staffed with ignorant and incapable\r\nyoung men, exist, on the other hand, to witness that public education is\r\nno matter to be left to merely commercial enterprise working upon\r\nparental ignorance and social prejudice. The necessary condition to the\r\neffective development of the New Republic is a universally accessible,\r\nspacious, and varied educational system working in an atmosphere of\r\nefficient criticism and general intellectual activity. Schools alone are\r\nof no avail, universities are merely dens of the higher cramming, unless\r\nthe schoolmasters and schoolmistresses and lecturers are in touch with\r\nand under the light of an abundant, contemporary, and fully adult\r\nintellectuality. At present, in Great Britain at least, the headmasters\r\nentrusted with the education of the bulk of the influential men of the\r\nnext decades are conspicuously second-rate men, forced and etiolated\r\ncreatures, scholarship boys manured with annotated editions, and brought\r\nup under and protected from all current illumination by the kale-pot of\r\nthe Thirty-nine Articles. Many of them are less capable teachers and\r\neven less intelligent men than many Board School teachers. There is,\r\nhowever, urgent need of an absolutely new type of school--a school that\r\nshall be, at least, so skilfully conducted as to supply the necessary\r\ntraining in mathematics, dialectics, languages, and drawing, and the\r\nnecessary knowledge of science, without either consuming all the leisure\r\nof the boy or destroying his individuality, as it is destroyed by the\r\nignorant and pretentious blunderers of to-day; and there is an equally\r\nmanifest need of a new type of University, something other than a happy\r\nfastness for those precociously brilliant creatures--creatures whose\r\nbrilliance is too often the hectic indication of a constitutional\r\nunsoundness of mind--who can \"get in\" before the portcullis of the\r\nnineteenth birthday falls. These new educational elements may either\r\ngrow slowly through the steady and painful pressure of remorseless\r\nfacts, or, as the effort to evoke the New Republic becomes more\r\nconscious and deliberate, they may be rapidly brought into being by the\r\nconscious endeavours of capable men. Assuredly they will never be\r\ndeveloped by the wisdom of the governments of the grey. It may be\r\npointed out that in an individual and disorganized way a growing sense\r\nof such needs is already displayed. Such great business managers as Mr.\r\nAndrew Carnegie, for example, and many other of the wealthy efficients\r\nof the United States of America, are displaying a strong disinclination\r\nto found families of functionless shareholders, and a strong disposition\r\nto contribute, by means of colleges, libraries, and splendid\r\nfoundations, to the future of the whole English-speaking world. Of\r\ncourse, Mr. Carnegie is not an educational specialist, and his good\r\nintentions will be largely exploited by the energetic mediocrities who\r\ncontrol our educational affairs. But it is the intention that concerns\r\nus now, and not the precise method or effect. Indisputably these rich\r\nAmericans are at a fundamentally important work in these endowments, and\r\nas indisputably many of their successors--I do not mean the heirs to\r\ntheir private wealth, but the men of the same type who will play their\r\n_rôle_ in the coming years--will carry on this spacious work with a\r\nwider prospect and a clearer common understanding.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of modern and efficient schools is alone not\r\nsufficient for the intellectual needs of the coming time. The school and\r\nuniversity are merely the preparation for the life of mental activity in\r\nwhich the citizen of the coming state will live. The three years of\r\nuniversity and a lifetime of garrulous stagnation which constitutes the\r\nmind's history of many a public schoolmaster, for example, and most of\r\nthe clergy to-day, will be impossible under the new needs. The\r\nold-fashioned university, secure in its omniscience, merely taught; the\r\nuniversity of the coming time will, as its larger function, criticize\r\nand learn. It will be organized for research--for the criticism, that\r\nis, of thought and nature. And a subtler and a greater task before those\r\nwho will presently swear allegiance to the New Republic is to aid and\r\nstimulate that process of sound adult mental activity which is the\r\ncardinal element in human life. After all, in spite of the pretentious\r\nimpostors who trade upon the claim, literature, contemporary literature,\r\nis the breath of civilized life, and those who sincerely think and write\r\nthe salt of the social body. To mumble over the past, to live on the\r\nclassics, however splendid, is senility. The New Republic, therefore,\r\nwill sustain its authors. In the past the author lived within the limits\r\nof his patron's susceptibility, and led the world, so far as he did\r\nlead it, from that cage. In the present he lives within the limits of a\r\nparticularly distressful and ill-managed market. He must please and\r\ninterest the public before he may reason with it, and even to reach the\r\npublic ear involves other assiduities than writing. To write one's best\r\nis surely sufficient work for a man, but unless the author is prepared\r\nto add to his literary toil the correspondence and alert activity of a\r\nbusiness man, he may find that no measure of acceptance will save him\r\nfrom a mysterious poverty. Publishing has become a trade, differing only\r\nfrom the trade in pork or butter in the tradesman's careless\r\nbook-keeping and his professed indifference to the quality of his goods.\r\nBut unless the whole mass of argument in these Anticipations is false,\r\npublishing is as much, or even more, of a public concern than education,\r\nand as little to be properly discharged by private men working for\r\nprofit. On the other hand, it is not to be undertaken by a government of\r\nthe grey, for a confusion cannot undertake to clarify itself; it is an\r\nactivity in which the New Republic will necessarily engage.\r\n\r\nThe men of the New Republic will be intelligently critical men, and they\r\nwill have the courage of their critical conclusions. For the sake of the\r\nEnglish tongue, for the sake of the English peoples, they will set\r\nthemselves to put temptingly within the reach of all readers of the\r\ntongue, and all possible readers of the tongue, an abundance of living\r\nliterature. They will endeavour to shape great publishing trusts and\r\nassociations that will have the same relation to the publishing office\r\nof to-day that a medical association has to a patent-medicine dealer.\r\nThey will not only publish, but sell; their efficient book-shops, their\r\nefficient system of book-distribution will replace the present haphazard\r\ndealings of quite illiterate persons under whose shadows people in the\r\nprovinces live.[48] If one of these publishing groups decides that a\r\nbook, new or old, is of value to the public mind, I conceive the\r\ncopyright will be secured and the book produced all over the world in\r\nevery variety of form and price that seems necessary to its exhaustive\r\nsale. Moreover, these publishing associations will sustain spaciously\r\nconceived organs of opinion and criticism, which will begin by being\r\npatiently and persistently good, and so develop into power. And the more\r\ndistinctly the New Republic emerges, the less danger there will be of\r\nthese associations being allowed to outlive their service in a state of\r\nossified authority. New groups of men and new phases of thought will\r\norganize their publishing associations as children learn to talk.[49]\r\n\r\nAnd while the New Republic is thus developing its idea of itself and\r\norganizing its mind, it will also be growing out of the confused and\r\nintricate businesses and undertakings and public services of the present\r\ntime, into a recognizable material body. The synthetic process that is\r\ngoing on in the case of many of the larger of the businesses of the\r\nworld, that formation of Trusts that bulks so large in American\r\ndiscussion, is of the utmost significance in this connection.\r\nConceivably the first impulse to form Trusts came from a mere desire to\r\ncontrol competition and economize working expenses, but even in its very\r\nfirst stages this process of coalescence has passed out of the region of\r\ncommercial operations into that of public affairs. The Trust develops\r\ninto the organization under men far more capable than any sort of public\r\nofficials, of entire industries, of entire departments of public life,\r\nquite outside the ostensible democratic government system altogether.\r\nThe whole apparatus of communications, which we have seen to be of such\r\nprimary importance in the making of the future, promises to pass, in the\r\ncase of the United States at least, out of the region of scramble into\r\nthe domain of deliberate control. Even to-day the Trusts are taking over\r\nquite consciously the most vital national matters. The American iron and\r\nsteel industries have been drawn together and developed in a manner that\r\nis a necessary preliminary to the capture of the empire of the seas.\r\nThat end is declaredly within the vista of these operations, within\r\ntheir initial design. These things are not the work of dividend-hunting\r\nimbeciles, but of men who regard wealth as a convention, as a means to\r\nspacious material ends. There is an animated little paper published in\r\nLos Angeles in the interests of Mr. Wilshire, which bears upon its\r\nforefront the maxim, \"Let the Nation own the Trusts.\" Well, under their\r\nmantle of property, the Trusts grow continually more elaborate and\r\nefficient machines of production and public service, while the formal\r\nnation chooses its bosses and buttons and reads its illustrated press. I\r\nmust confess I do not see the negro and the poor Irishman and all the\r\nemigrant sweepings of Europe, which constitute the bulk of the American\r\nAbyss, uniting to form that great Socialist party of which Mr. Wilshire\r\ndreams, and with a little demonstrating and balloting taking over the\r\nfoundry and the electrical works, the engine shed and the signal box,\r\nfrom the capable men in charge. But that a confluent system of\r\nTrust-owned business organisms, and of Universities and re-organized\r\nmilitary and naval services may presently discover an essential unity of\r\npurpose, presently begin thinking a literature, and behaving like a\r\nState, is a much more possible thing....\r\n\r\nIn its more developed phases I seem to see the New Republic as (if I may\r\nuse an expressive bull) a sort of outspoken Secret Society, with which\r\neven the prominent men of the ostensible state may be openly affiliated.\r\nA vast number of men admit the need but hesitate at the means of\r\nrevolution, and in this conception of a slowly growing new social order\r\norganized with open deliberation within the substance of the old, there\r\nare no doubt elements of technical treason, but an enormous gain in the\r\nthoroughness, efficiency, and stability of the possible change.\r\n\r\nSo it is, or at least in some such ways, that I conceive the growing\r\nsense of itself which the new class of modern efficients will develop,\r\nwill become manifest in movements and concerns that are now\r\nheterogeneous and distinct, but will presently drift into co-operation\r\nand coalescence. This idea of a synthetic reconstruction within the\r\nbodies of the English-speaking States may very possibly clothe itself in\r\nquite other formulæ than my phrase of the New Republic; but the need is\r\nwith us, the social elements are developing among us, the appliances are\r\narranging themselves for the hands that will use them, and I cannot but\r\nbelieve that the idea of a spacious common action will presently come.\r\nIn a few years I believe many men who are now rather aimless--men who\r\nhave disconsolately watched the collapse of the old Liberalism--will be\r\nclearly telling themselves and one another of their adhesion to this new\r\nideal. They will be working in schools and newspaper offices, in\r\nfoundries and factories, in colleges and laboratories, in county\r\ncouncils and on school boards--even, it may be, in pulpits--for the time\r\nwhen the coming of the New Republic will be ripe. It may be dawning even\r\nin the schools of law, because presently there will be a new and\r\nscientific handling of jurisprudence. The highly educated and efficient\r\nofficers' mess will rise mechanically and drink to the Monarch, and sit\r\ndown to go on discussing the New Republic's growth. I do not see,\r\nindeed, why an intelligent monarch himself, in these days, should not\r\nwaive any silliness about Divine Right, and all the ill-bred pretensions\r\nthat sit so heavily on a gentlemanly King, and come into the movement\r\nwith these others. When the growing conception touches, as in America it\r\nhas already touched, the legacy-leaving class, there will be fewer new\r\nAsylums perhaps, but more university chairs....\r\n\r\nSo it is I conceive the elements of the New Republic taking shape and\r\nrunning together through the social mass, picking themselves out more\r\nand more clearly, from the shareholder, the parasitic speculator and the\r\nwretched multitudes of the Abyss. The New Republicans will constitute an\r\ninformal and open freemasonry. In all sorts of ways they will be\r\ninfluencing and controlling the apparatus of the ostensible governments,\r\nthey will be pruning irresponsible property, checking speculators and\r\ncontrolling the abyssward drift, but at that, at an indirect control, at\r\nany sort of fiction, the New Republic, from the very nature of its\r\ncardinal ideas, will not rest. The clearest and simplest statement, the\r\nclearest and simplest method, is inevitably associated with the\r\nconceptions of that science upon which the New Republic will arise.\r\nThere will be a time, in peace it may be, or under the stresses of\r\nwarfare, when the New Republic will find itself ready to arrive, when\r\nthe theory will have been worked out and the details will be generally\r\naccepted, and the new order will be ripe to begin. And then, indeed, it\r\nwill begin. What life or strength will be left in the old order to\r\nprevent this new order beginning?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] I foresee great scope for the ingenious persons who write so\r\nabundantly to the London evening papers upon etymological points, issues\r\nin heraldry, and the correct Union Jack, in the very pleasing topic of a\r\npossible Anglo-American flag (for use at first only on unofficial\r\noccasions).\r\n\r\n[48] In a large town like Folkestone, for example, it is practically\r\nimpossible to buy any book but a \"boomed\" novel unless one has\r\nascertained the names of the author, the book, the edition, and the\r\npublisher. There is no index in existence kept up to date that supplies\r\nthese particulars. If, for example, one wants--as I want (1) to read all\r\nthat I have not read of the work of Mr. Frank Stockton, (2) to read a\r\nbook of essays by Professor Ray Lankaster the title of which I have\r\nforgotten, and (3) to buy the most convenient edition of the works of\r\nSwift, one has to continue wanting until the British Museum Library\r\nchances to get in one's way. The book-selling trade supplies no\r\ninformation at all on these points.\r\n\r\n[49] One of the least satisfactory features of the intellectual\r\natmosphere of the present time is the absence of good controversy. To\r\nfollow closely an honest and subtle controversy, and to have arrived at\r\na definite opinion upon some general question of real and practical\r\ninterest and complicated reference, is assuredly the most educational\r\nexercise in the world--I would go so far as to say that no person is\r\ncompletely educated who has not done as much. The memorable discussions\r\nin which Huxley figured, for example, were extraordinarily stimulating.\r\nWe lack that sort of thing now. A great number of people are expressing\r\nconflicting opinions upon all sorts of things, but there is a quite\r\nremarkable shirking of plain issues of debate. There is no answering\r\nback. There is much indirect answering, depreciation of the adversary,\r\nattempts to limit his publicity, restatements of the opposing opinion in\r\na new way, but no conflict in the lists. We no longer fight obnoxious\r\nviews, but assassinate them. From first to last, for example, there has\r\nbeen no honest discussion of the fundamental issues in the Boer War.\r\nSomething may be due to the multiplication of magazines and newspapers,\r\nand the confusion of opinions that has scattered the\r\ncontroversy-following public. It is much to be regretted that the laws\r\nof copyright and the methods of publication stand in the way of\r\nannotated editions of works of current controversial value. For example,\r\nMr. Andrew Lang has assailed the new edition of the \"Golden Bough.\" His\r\ncriticisms, which are, no doubt, very shrewd and penetrating, ought to\r\nbe accessible with the text he criticizes. Yet numerous people will read\r\nhis comments who will never read the \"Golden Bough;\" they will accept\r\nhis dinted sword as proof of the slaughter of Mr. Fraser, and many will\r\nread the \"Golden Bough\" and never hear of Mr. Lang's comments. Why\r\nshould it be so hopeless to suggest an edition of the \"Golden Bough\"\r\nwith footnotes by Mr. Lang and Mr. Fraser's replies? There are all sorts\r\nof books to which Mr. Lang might add footnotes with infinite benefit to\r\nevery one. Mr. Mallock, again, is going to explain how Science and\r\nReligion stand at the present time. If only some one would explain in\r\nthe margin how Mr. Mallock stands, the thing would be complete. Such a\r\nbook, again, as these \"Anticipations\" would stand a vast amount of\r\ncontroversial footnoting. It bristles with pegs for discussion--vacant\r\npegs; it is written to provoke. I hope that some publisher, sooner or\r\nlater, will do something of this kind, and will give us not only the\r\ntext of an author's work, but a series of footnotes and appendices by\r\nreputable antagonists. The experiment, well handled, might prove\r\nsuccessful enough to start a fashion--a very beneficial fashion for\r\nauthors and readers alike. People would write twice as carefully and\r\ntwice as clearly with that possible second edition (with footnotes by X\r\nand Y) in view. Imagine \"The Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture\" as it\r\nmight have been edited by the late Professor Huxley; Froude's edition of\r\nthe \"Grammar of Assent;\" Mr. G. B. Shaw's edition of the works of Mr.\r\nLecky; or the criticism of art and life of Ruskin,--the \"Beauties of\r\nRuskin\" annotated by Mr. Whistler and carefully prepared for the press\r\nby Professor William James. Like the tomato and the cucumber, every book\r\nwould carry its antidote wrapped about it. Impossible, you say. But is\r\nit? Or is it only unprecedented? If novelists will consent to the\r\nillustration of their stories by artists whose chief aim appears to be\r\nto contradict their statements, I do not see why controversial writers\r\nwho believe their opinions are correct should object to the checking of\r\ntheir facts and logic by persons with a different way of thinking. Why\r\nshould not men of opposite opinions collaborate in their discussion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE FAITH, MORALS, AND PUBLIC POLICY OF THE NEW REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the surmise of a developing New Republic--a Republic that must\r\nultimately become a World State of capable rational men, developing\r\namidst the fading contours and colours of our existing nations and\r\ninstitutions--be indeed no idle dream, but an attainable possibility in\r\nthe future, and to that end it is that the preceding Anticipations have\r\nbeen mainly written, it becomes a speculation of very great interest to\r\nforecast something of the general shape and something even of certain\r\ndetails of that common body of opinion which the New Republic, when at\r\nlast it discovers and declares itself, will possess. Since we have\r\nsupposed this New Republic will already be consciously and pretty freely\r\ncontrolling the general affairs of humanity before this century closes,\r\nits broad principles and opinions must necessarily shape and determine\r\nthat still ampler future of which the coming hundred years is but the\r\nopening phase. There are many processes, many aspects of things, that\r\nare now, as it were, in the domain of natural laws and outside human\r\ncontrol, or controlled unintelligently and superstitiously, that in the\r\nfuture, in the days of the coming New Republic, will be definitely taken\r\nin hand as part of the general work of humanity, as indeed already,\r\nsince the beginning of the nineteenth century, the control of\r\npestilences has been taken in hand. And in particular, there are certain\r\nbroad questions much under discussion to which, thus far, I have\r\npurposely given a value disproportionately small:--\r\n\r\nWhile the New Republic is gathering itself together and becoming aware\r\nof itself, that other great element, which I have called the People of\r\nthe Abyss, will also have followed out its destiny. For many decades\r\nthat development will be largely or entirely out of all human control.\r\nTo the multiplying rejected of the white and yellow civilizations there\r\nwill have been added a vast proportion of the black and brown races, and\r\ncollectively those masses will propound the general question, \"What will\r\nyou do with us, we hundreds of millions, who cannot keep pace with you?\"\r\nIf the New Republic emerges at all it will emerge by grappling with this\r\nriddle; it must come into existence by the passes this Sphinx will\r\nguard. Moreover, the necessary results of the reaction of irresponsible\r\nwealth upon that infirm and dangerous thing the human will, the\r\nspreading moral rot of gambling which is associated with irresponsible\r\nwealth, will have been working out, and will continue to work out, so\r\nlong as there is such a thing as irresponsible wealth pervading the\r\nsocial body. That too the New Republic must in its very development\r\novercome. In the preceding chapter it is clearly implicit that I believe\r\nthat the New Republic, as its consciousness and influence develop\r\ntogether, will meet, check, and control these things; but the broad\r\nprinciples upon which the control will go, the nature of the methods\r\nemployed, still remain to be deduced. And to make that deduction, it is\r\nnecessary that the primary conception of life, the fundamental,\r\nreligious, and moral ideas of these predominant men of the new time\r\nshould first be considered.\r\n\r\nNow, quite inevitably, these men will be religious men. Being\r\nthemselves, as by the nature of the forces that have selected them they\r\nwill certainly be, men of will and purpose, they will be disposed to\r\nfind, and consequently they will find, an effect of purpose in the\r\ntotality of things. Either one must believe the Universe to be one and\r\nsystematic, and held together by some omnipresent quality, or one must\r\nbelieve it to be a casual aggregation, an incoherent accumulation with\r\nno unity whatsoever outside the unity of the personality regarding it.\r\nAll science and most modern religious systems presuppose the former, and\r\nto believe the former is, to any one not too anxious to quibble, to\r\nbelieve in God. But I believe that these prevailing men of the future,\r\nlike many of the saner men of to-day, having so formulated their\r\nfundamental belief, will presume to no knowledge whatever, will presume\r\nto no possibility of knowledge of the real being of God. They will have\r\nno positive definition of God at all. They will certainly not indulge in\r\n\"that something, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness\" (not\r\ndefined) or any defective claptrap of that sort. They will content\r\nthemselves with denying the self-contradictory absurdities of an\r\nobstinately anthropomorphic theology,[50] they will regard the whole of\r\nbeing, within themselves and without, as the sufficient revelation of\r\nGod to their souls, and they will set themselves simply to that\r\nrevelation, seeking its meaning towards themselves faithfully and\r\ncourageously. Manifestly the essential being of man in this life is his\r\nwill; he exists consciously only to _do_; his main interest in life is\r\nthe choice between alternatives; and, since he moves through space and\r\ntime to effects and consequences, a general purpose in space and time is\r\nthe limit of his understanding. He can know God only under the semblance\r\nof a pervading purpose, of which his own individual freedom of will is a\r\npart, but he can understand that the purpose that exists in space and\r\ntime is no more God than a voice calling out of impenetrable darkness is\r\na man. To men of the kinetic type belief in God so manifest as purpose\r\nis irresistible, and, to all lucid minds, the being of God, save as that\r\ngeneral atmosphere of imperfectly apprehended purpose in which our\r\nindividual wills operate, is incomprehensible. To cling to any belief\r\nmore detailed than this, to define and limit God in order to take hold\r\nof Him, to detach one's self and parts of the universe from God in some\r\nmysterious way in order to reduce life to a dramatic antagonism, is not\r\nfaith, but infirmity. Excessive strenuous belief is not faith. By faith\r\nwe disbelieve, and it is the drowning man, and not the strong swimmer,\r\nwho clutches at the floating straw. It is in the nature of man, it is in\r\nthe present purpose of things, that the real world of our experience and\r\nwill should appear to us not only as a progressive existence in space\r\nand time, but as a scheme of good and evil. But choice, the antagonism\r\nof good and evil, just as much as the formulation of things in space and\r\ntime, is merely a limiting condition of human being, and in the thought\r\nof God as we conceive of Him in the light of faith, this antagonism\r\nvanishes. God is no moralist, God is no partisan; He comprehends and\r\ncannot be comprehended, and our business is only with so much of His\r\npurpose as centres on our individual wills.\r\n\r\nSo, or in some such phrases, I believe, these men of the New Republic\r\nwill formulate their relationship to God. They will live to serve this\r\npurpose that presents Him, without presumption and without fear. For the\r\nsame spacious faith that will render the idea of airing their egotisms\r\nin God's presence through prayer, or of any such quite personal\r\nintimacy, absurd, will render the idea of an irascible and punitive\r\nDeity ridiculous and incredible....\r\n\r\nThe men of the New Republic will hold and understand quite clearly the\r\ndoctrine that in the real world of man's experience, there is Free Will.\r\nThey will understand that constantly, as a very condition of his\r\nexistence, man is exercising choice between alternatives, and that a\r\nconflict between motives that have different moral values constantly\r\narises. That conflict between Predestination and Free Will, which is so\r\npuzzling to untrained minds, will not exist for them. They will know\r\nthat in the real world of sensory experience, will is free, just as new\r\nsprung grass is green, wood hard, ice cold, and toothache painful. In\r\nthe abstract world of reasoning science there is no green, no colour at\r\nall, but certain lengths of vibration; no hardness, but a certain\r\nreaction of molecules; no cold and no pain, but certain molecular\r\nconsequences in the nerves that reach the misinterpreting mind. In the\r\nabstract world of reasoning science, moreover, there is a rigid and\r\ninevitable sequence of cause and effect; every act of man could be\r\nforetold to its uttermost detail, if only we knew him and all his\r\ncircumstances fully; in the abstract world of reasoned science all\r\nthings exist now potentially down to the last moment of infinite time.\r\nBut the human will does not exist in the abstract world of reasoned\r\nscience, in the world of atoms and vibrations, that rigidly predestinate\r\nscheme of things in space and time. The human will exists in this world\r\nof men and women, in this world where the grass is green and desire\r\nbeckons and the choice is often so wide and clear between the sense of\r\nwhat is desirable and what is more widely and remotely right. In this\r\nworld of sense and the daily life, these men will believe with an\r\nabsolute conviction, that there is free will and a personal moral\r\nresponsibility in relation to that indistinctly seen purpose which is\r\nthe sufficient revelation of God to them so far as this sphere of being\r\ngoes....\r\n\r\nThe conception they will have of that purpose will necessarily determine\r\ntheir ethical scheme. It follows manifestly that if we do really\r\nbelieve in Almighty God, the more strenuously and successfully we seek\r\nin ourselves and His world to understand the order and progress of\r\nthings, and the more clearly we apprehend His purpose, the more assured\r\nand systematic will our ethical basis become.\r\n\r\nIf, like Huxley, we do not positively believe in God, then we may still\r\ncling to an ethical system which has become an organic part of our lives\r\nand habits, and finding it manifestly in conflict with the purpose of\r\nthings, speak of the non-ethical order of the universe. But to any one\r\nwhose mind is pervaded by faith in God, a non-ethical universe in\r\nconflict with the incomprehensibly ethical soul of the Agnostic, is as\r\nincredible as a black horned devil, an active material anti-god with\r\nhoofs, tail, pitchfork, and Dunstan-scorched nose complete. To believe\r\ncompletely in God is to believe in the final rightness of all being. The\r\nethical system that condemns the ways of life as wrong, or points to the\r\nways of death as right, that countenances what the scheme of things\r\ncondemns, and condemns the general purpose in things as it is now\r\nrevealed to us, must prepare to follow the theological edifice upon\r\nwhich it was originally based. If the universe is non-ethical by our\r\npresent standards, we must reconsider these standards and reconstruct\r\nour ethics. To hesitate to do so, however severe the conflict with old\r\nhabits and traditions and sentiments may be, is to fall short of faith.\r\n\r\nNow, so far as the intellectual life of the world goes, this present\r\ntime is essentially the opening phase of a period of ethical\r\nreconstruction, a reconstruction of which the New Republic will possess\r\nthe matured result. Throughout the nineteenth century there has been\r\nsuch a shattering and recasting of fundamental ideas, of the\r\npreliminaries to ethical propositions, as the world has never seen\r\nbefore. This breaking down and routing out of almost all the cardinal\r\nassumptions on which the minds of the Eighteenth Century dwelt securely,\r\nis a process akin to, but independent of, the development of mechanism,\r\nwhose consequences we have traced. It is a part of that process of\r\nvigorous and fearless criticism which is the reality of science, and of\r\nwhich the development of mechanism and all that revolution in physical\r\nand social conditions we have been tracing, is merely the vast imposing\r\nmaterial bye product. At present, indeed, its more obvious aspect on the\r\nmoral and ethical side is destruction, any one can see the chips flying,\r\nbut it still demands a certain faith and patience to see the form that\r\nensues. But it is not destruction, any more than a sculptor's work is\r\nstone-breaking.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter in the history of this intellectual development, its\r\ndefinite and formal opening, coincides with the opening of the\r\nnineteenth century and the publication of Malthus's _Essay on\r\nPopulation_. Malthus is one of those cardinal figures in intellectual\r\nhistory who state definitely for all time, things apparent enough after\r\ntheir formulation, but never effectively conceded before. He brought\r\nclearly and emphatically into the sphere of discussion a vitally\r\nimportant issue that had always been shirked and tabooed heretofore, the\r\nfundamental fact that the main mass of the business of human life\r\ncentres about reproduction. He stated in clear, hard, decent, and\r\nunavoidable argument what presently Schopenhauer was to discover and\r\nproclaim, in language, at times, it would seem, quite unfitted for\r\ntranslation into English. And, having made his statement, Malthus left\r\nit, in contact with its immediate results.\r\n\r\nProbably no more shattering book than the _Essay on Population_ has ever\r\nbeen, or ever will be, written. It was aimed at the facile Liberalism of\r\nthe Deists and Atheists of the eighteenth century; it made as clear as\r\ndaylight that all forms of social reconstruction, all dreams of earthly\r\ngolden ages must be either futile or insincere or both, until the\r\nproblems of human increase were manfully faced. It proffered no\r\nsuggestions for facing them (in spite of the unpleasant associations of\r\nMalthus's name), it aimed simply to wither the Rationalistic Utopias of\r\nthe time and by anticipation, all the Communisms, Socialisms, and\r\nEarthly Paradise movements that have since been so abundantly audible in\r\nthe world. That was its aim and its immediate effect. Incidentally it\r\nmust have been a torturing soul-trap for innumerable idealistic but\r\nintelligent souls. Its indirect effects have been altogether greater.\r\nAiming at unorthodox dreamers, it has set such forces in motion as have\r\ndestroyed the very root-ideas of orthodox righteousness in the western\r\nworld. Impinging on geological discovery, it awakened almost\r\nsimultaneously in the minds of Darwin and Wallace, that train of thought\r\nthat found expression and demonstration at last in the theory of natural\r\nselection. As that theory has been more and more thoroughly assimilated\r\nand understood by the general mind, it has destroyed, quietly but\r\nentirely, the belief in human equality which is implicit in all the\r\n\"Liberalizing\" movements of the world. In the place of an essential\r\nequality, distorted only by tradition and early training, by the\r\nartifices of those devils of the Liberal cosmogony, \"kingcraft\" and\r\n\"priestcraft,\" an equality as little affected by colour as the equality\r\nof a black chess pawn and a white, we discover that all men are\r\nindividual and unique, and, through long ranges of comparison, superior\r\nand inferior upon countless scores. It has become apparent that whole\r\nmasses of human population are, as a whole, inferior in their claim upon\r\nthe future, to other masses, that they cannot be given opportunities or\r\ntrusted with power as the superior peoples are trusted, that their\r\ncharacteristic weaknesses are contagious and detrimental in the\r\ncivilizing fabric, and that their range of incapacity tempts and\r\ndemoralizes the strong. To give them equality is to sink to their\r\nlevel, to protect and cherish them is to be swamped in their fecundity.\r\nThe confident and optimistic Radicalism of the earlier nineteenth\r\ncentury, and the humanitarian philanthropic type of Liberalism, have\r\nbogged themselves beyond hope in these realizations. The Socialist has\r\nshirked them as he has shirked the older crux of Malthus. Liberalism is\r\na thing of the past, it is no longer a doctrine, but a faction. There\r\nmust follow some newborn thing.\r\n\r\nAnd as effectually has the mass of criticism that centres about Darwin\r\ndestroyed the dogma of the Fall upon which the whole intellectual fabric\r\nof Christianity rests. For without a Fall there is no redemption, and\r\nthe whole theory and meaning of the Pauline system is vain. In\r\nconjunction with the wide vistas opened by geological and astronomical\r\ndiscovery, the nineteenth century has indeed lost the very habit of\r\nthought from which the belief in a Fall arose. It is as if a hand had\r\nbeen put upon the head of the thoughtful man and had turned his eyes\r\nabout from the past to the future. In matters of intelligence, at least,\r\nif not yet in matters of ethics and conduct, this turning round has\r\noccurred. In the past thought was legal in its spirit, it deduced the\r\npresent from pre-existing prescription, it derived everything from the\r\noffences and promises of the dead; the idea of a universe of expiation\r\nwas the most natural theory amidst such processes. The purpose the\r\nolder theologians saw in the world was no more than the\r\nrevenge--accentuated by the special treatment of a favoured minority--of\r\na mysteriously incompetent Deity exasperated by an unsatisfactory\r\ncreation. But modern thought is altogether too constructive and creative\r\nto tolerate such a conception, and in the vaster past that has opened to\r\nus, it can find neither offence nor promise, only a spacious scheme of\r\nevents, opening out--perpetually opening out--with a quality of final\r\npurpose as irresistible to most men's minds as it is incomprehensible,\r\nopening out with all that inexplicable quality of design that, for\r\nexample, some great piece of music, some symphony of Beethoven's,\r\nconveys. We see future beyond future and past behind past. It has been\r\nlike the coming of dawn, at first a colourless dawn, clear and spacious,\r\nbefore which the mists whirl and fade, and there opens to our eyes not\r\nthe narrow passage, the definite end we had imagined, but the rocky,\r\nill-defined path we follow high amidst this limitless prospect of space\r\nand time. At first the dawn is cold--there is, at times, a quality of\r\nterror almost in the cold clearness of the morning twilight; but\r\ninsensibly its coldness passes, the sky is touched with fire, and\r\npresently, up out of the dayspring in the east, the sunlight will be\r\npouring.... And these men of the New Republic will be going about in the\r\ndaylight of things assured.\r\n\r\nAnd men's concern under this ampler view will no longer be to work out\r\na system of penalties for the sins of dead men, but to understand and\r\nparticipate in this great development that now dawns on the human\r\nunderstanding. The insoluble problems of pain and death, gaunt,\r\nincomprehensible facts as they were, fall into place in the gigantic\r\norder that evolution unfolds. All things are integral in the mighty\r\nscheme, the slain builds up the slayer, the wolf grooms the horse into\r\nswiftness, and the tiger calls for wisdom and courage out of man. All\r\nthings are integral, but it has been left for men to be consciously\r\nintegral, to take, at last, a share in the process, to have wills that\r\nhave caught a harmony with the universal will, as sand grains flash into\r\nsplendour under the blaze of the sun. There will be many who will never\r\nbe called to this religious conviction, who will lead their little lives\r\nlike fools, playing foolishly with religion and all the great issues of\r\nlife, or like the beasts that perish, having sense alone; but those who,\r\nby character and intelligence, are predestinate to participate in the\r\nreality of life, will fearlessly shape all their ethical determinations\r\nand public policy anew, from a fearless study of themselves and the\r\napparent purpose that opens out before them.\r\n\r\nVery much of the cry for faith that sounds in contemporary life so\r\nloudly, and often with so distressing a note of sincerity, comes from\r\nthe unsatisfied egotisms of unemployed, and, therefore, unhappy and\r\ncraving people; but much is also due to the distress in the minds of\r\nactive and serious men, due to the conflict of inductive knowledge, with\r\nconceptions of right and wrong deduced from unsound, but uncriticised,\r\nfirst principles. The old ethical principles, the principle of\r\nequivalents or justice, the principle of self-sacrifice, the various\r\nvague and arbitrary ideas of purity, chastity, and sexual \"sin,\" came\r\nlike rays out of the theological and philosophical lanterns men carried\r\nin the darkness. The ray of the lantern indicated and directed, and one\r\nfollowed it as one follows a path. But now there has come a new view of\r\nman's place in the scheme of time and space, a new illumination, dawn;\r\nthe lantern rays fade in the growing brightness, and the lanterns that\r\nshone so brightly are becoming smoky and dim. To many men this is no\r\nmore than a waning of the lanterns, and they call for new ones, or a\r\ntrimming of the old. They blame the day for putting out these flares.\r\nAnd some go apart, out of the glare of life, into corners of obscurity,\r\nwhere the radiation of the lantern may still be faintly traced. But,\r\nindeed, with the new light there has come the time for new methods; the\r\ntime of lanterns, the time of deductions from arbitrary first principles\r\nis over. The act of faith is no longer to follow your lantern, but to\r\nput it down. We can see about us, and by the landscape we must go.[51]\r\n\r\nHow will the landscape shape itself to the dominant men of the new time\r\nand in relation to themselves? What is the will and purpose that these\r\nmen of will and purpose will find above and comprehending their own?\r\nInto this our inquiry resolves itself. They will hold with Schopenhauer,\r\nI believe, and with those who build themselves on Malthus and Darwin,\r\nthat the scheme of being, in which we live is a struggle of existences\r\nto expand and develop themselves to their full completeness, and to\r\npropagate and increase themselves. But, being men of action, they will\r\nfeel nothing of the glamour of misery that irresponsible and sexually\r\nvitiated shareholder, Schopenhauer, threw over this recognition. The\r\nfinal object of this struggle among existences they will not understand;\r\nthey will have abandoned the search for ultimates; they will state this\r\nscheme of a struggle as a proximate object, sufficiently remote and\r\nspacious to enclose and explain all their possible activities. They will\r\nseek God's purpose in the sphere of their activities, and desire no\r\nmore, as the soldier in battle desires no more, than the immediate\r\nconflict before him. They will admit failure as an individual aspect of\r\nthings, as a soldier seeking victory admits the possibility of death;\r\nbut they will refuse to admit as a part of their faith in God that any\r\nexistence, even if it is an existence that is presently entirely erased,\r\ncan be needless or vain. It will have reacted on the existences that\r\nsurvive; it will be justified for ever in the modification it has\r\nproduced in them. They will find in themselves--it must be remembered I\r\nam speaking of a class that has naturally segregated, and not of men as\r\na whole--a desire, a passion almost, to create and organize, to put in\r\norder, to get the maximum result from certain possibilities. They will\r\nall be artists in reality, with a passion for simplicity and directness\r\nand an impatience of confusion and inefficiency. The determining frame\r\nof their ethics, the more spacious scheme to which they will shape the\r\nschemes of their individual wills, will be the elaboration of that\r\nfuture world state to which all things are pointing. They will not\r\nconceive of it as a millennial paradise, a blissful inconsequent\r\nstagnation, but as a world state of active ampler human beings, full of\r\nknowledge and energy, free from much of the baseness and limitations,\r\nthe needless pains and dishonours of the world disorder of to-day, but\r\nstill struggling, struggling against ampler but still too narrow\r\nrestrictions and for still more spacious objects than our vistas have\r\nrevealed. For that as a general end, for the special work that\r\ncontributes to it as an individual end, they will make the plans and the\r\nlimiting rules of their lives.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that a reconstructed ethical system, reconstructed in the\r\nlight of modern science and to meet the needs of such temperaments and\r\ncharacters as the evolution of mechanism will draw together and develop,\r\nwill give very different values from those given by the existing systems\r\n(if they can be called systems) to almost all the great matters of\r\nconduct. Under scientific analysis the essential facts of life are very\r\nclearly shown to be two--birth and death. All life is the effort of the\r\nthing born, driven by fears, guided by instincts and desires, to evade\r\ndeath, to evade even the partial death of crippling or cramping or\r\nrestriction, and to attain to effective procreation, to the victory of\r\nanother birth. Procreation is the triumph of the living being over\r\ndeath; and in the case of man, who adds mind to his body, it is not only\r\nin his child but in the dissemination of his thought, the expression of\r\nhis mind in things done and made, that his triumph is to be found. And\r\nthe ethical system of these men of the New Republic, the ethical system\r\nwhich will dominate the world state, will be shaped primarily to favour\r\nthe procreation of what is fine and efficient and beautiful in\r\nhumanity--beautiful and strong bodies, clear and powerful minds, and a\r\ngrowing body of knowledge--and to check the procreation of base and\r\nservile types, of fear-driven and cowardly souls, of all that is mean\r\nand ugly and bestial in the souls, bodies, or habits of men. To do the\r\nlatter is to do the former; the two things are inseparable. And the\r\nmethod that nature has followed hitherto in the shaping of the world,\r\nwhereby weakness was prevented from propagating weakness, and cowardice\r\nand feebleness were saved from the accomplishment of their desires, the\r\nmethod that has only one alternative, the method that must in some cases\r\nstill be called in to the help of man, is death. In the new vision death\r\nis no inexplicable horror, no pointless terminal terror to the miseries\r\nof life, it is the end of all the pain of life, the end of the\r\nbitterness of failure, the merciful obliteration of weak and silly and\r\npointless things....\r\n\r\nThe new ethics will hold life to be a privilege and a responsibility,\r\nnot a sort of night refuge for base spirits out of the void; and the\r\nalternative in right conduct between living fully, beautifully, and\r\nefficiently will be to die. For a multitude of contemptible and silly\r\ncreatures, fear-driven and helpless and useless, unhappy or hatefully\r\nhappy in the midst of squalid dishonour, feeble, ugly, inefficient, born\r\nof unrestrained lusts, and increasing and multiplying through sheer\r\nincontinence and stupidity, the men of the New Republic will have little\r\npity and less benevolence. To make life convenient for the breeding of\r\nsuch people will seem to them not the most virtuous and amiable thing in\r\nthe world, as it is held to be now, but an exceedingly abominable\r\nproceeding. Procreation is an avoidable thing for sane persons of even\r\nthe most furious passions, and the men of the New Republic will hold\r\nthat the procreation of children who, by the circumstances of their\r\nparentage, _must_ be diseased bodily or mentally--I do not think it will\r\nbe difficult for the medical science of the coming time to define such\r\ncircumstances--is absolutely the most loathsome of all conceivable sins.\r\nThey will hold, I anticipate, that a certain portion of the\r\npopulation--the small minority, for example, afflicted with\r\nindisputably transmissible diseases, with transmissible mental\r\ndisorders, with such hideous incurable habits of mind as the craving for\r\nintoxication--exists only on sufferance, out of pity and patience, and\r\non the understanding that they do not propagate; and I do not foresee\r\nany reason to suppose that they will hesitate to kill when that\r\nsufferance is abused. And I imagine also the plea and proof that a grave\r\ncriminal is also insane will be regarded by them not as a reason for\r\nmercy, but as an added reason for death. I do not see how they can think\r\notherwise on the principles they will profess.\r\n\r\nThe men of the New Republic will not be squeamish, either, in facing or\r\ninflicting death, because they will have a fuller sense of the\r\npossibilities of life than we possess. They will have an ideal that will\r\nmake killing worth the while; like Abraham, they will have the faith to\r\nkill, and they will have no superstitions about death. They will\r\nnaturally regard the modest suicide of incurably melancholy, or diseased\r\nor helpless persons as a high and courageous act of duty rather than a\r\ncrime. And since they will regard, as indeed all men raised above a\r\nbrutish level do regard, a very long term of imprisonment as infinitely\r\nworse than death, as being, indeed, death with a living misery added to\r\nits natural terror, they will, I conceive, where the whole tenor of a\r\nman's actions, and not simply some incidental or impulsive action, seems\r\nto prove him unfitted for free life in the world, consider him\r\ncarefully, and condemn him, and remove him from being. All such killing\r\nwill be done with an opiate, for death is too grave a thing to be made\r\npainful or dreadful, and used as a deterrent from crime. If deterrent\r\npunishments are used at all in the code of the future, the deterrent\r\nwill neither be death, nor mutilation of the body, nor mutilation of the\r\nlife by imprisonment, nor any horrible things like that, but good\r\nscientifically caused pain, that will leave nothing but a memory. Yet\r\neven the memory of overwhelming pain is a sort of mutilation of the\r\nsoul. The idea that only those who are fit to live freely in an orderly\r\nworld-state should be permitted to live, is entirely against the use of\r\ndeterrent punishments at all. Against outrageous conduct to children or\r\nwomen, perhaps, or for very cowardly or brutal assaults of any sort, the\r\nmen of the future may consider pain a salutary remedy, at least during\r\nthe ages of transition while the brute is still at large. But since most\r\nacts of this sort done under conditions that neither torture nor\r\nexasperate, point to an essential vileness in the perpetrator, I am\r\ninclined to think that even in these cases the men of the coming time\r\nwill be far less disposed to torture than to kill. They will have\r\nanother aspect to consider. The conscious infliction of pain _for the\r\nsake of the pain_ is against the better nature of man, and it is unsafe\r\nand demoralizing for any one to undertake this duty. To kill under the\r\nseemly conditions science will afford is a far less offensive thing. The\r\nrulers of the future will grudge making good people into jailers,\r\nwarders, punishment-dealers, nurses, and attendants on the bad. People\r\nwho cannot live happily and freely in the world without spoiling the\r\nlives of others are better out of it. That is a current sentiment even\r\nto-day, but the men of the New Republic will have the courage of their\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nAnd the type of men that I conceive emerging in the coming years will\r\ndeal simply and logically not only with the business of death, but with\r\nbirth. At present the sexual morality of the civilized world is the most\r\nillogical and incoherent system of wild permissions and insane\r\nprohibitions, foolish tolerance and ruthless cruelty that it is possible\r\nto imagine. Our current civilization is a sexual lunatic. And it has\r\nlost its reason in this respect under the stresses of the new birth of\r\nthings, largely through the difficulties that have stood in the way, and\r\ndo still, in a diminishing degree, stand in the way of any sane\r\ndiscussion of the matter as a whole. To approach it is to approach\r\nexcitement. So few people seem to be leading happy and healthy sexual\r\nlives that to mention the very word \"sexual\" is to set them stirring, to\r\nbrighten the eye, lower the voice, and blanch or flush the cheek with a\r\nflavour of guilt. We are all, as it were, keeping our secrets and\r\nhiding our shames. One of the most curious revelations of this fact\r\noccurred only a few years ago, when the artless outpourings in fiction\r\nof certain young women who had failed to find light on problems that\r\npressed upon them for solution (and which it was certainly their\r\nbusiness as possible wives and mothers to solve) roused all sorts of\r\nrespectable people to a quite insane vehemence of condemnation. Now,\r\nthere are excellent reasons and a permanent necessity for the\r\npreservation of decency, and for a far more stringent suppression of\r\nmatter that is merely intended to excite than at present obtains, and\r\nthe chief of these reasons lies in the need of preserving the young from\r\na premature awakening, and indeed, in the interests of civilization, in\r\npositively delaying the period of awakening, retarding maturity and\r\nlengthening the period of growth and preparation as much as possible.\r\nBut purity and innocence may be prolonged too late; innocence is really\r\nno more becoming to adults than a rattle or a rubber consoler, and the\r\nbashfulness that hampers this discussion, that permits it only in a\r\nfurtive silly sort of way, has its ugly consequences in shames and\r\ncruelties, in miserable households and pitiful crises, in the production\r\nof countless, needless, and unhappy lives. Indeed, too often we carry\r\nour decency so far as to make it suggestive and stimulating in a\r\nnon-natural way; we invest the plain business of reproduction with a\r\nmystic religious quality far more unwholesome than a savage nakedness\r\ncould possibly be.\r\n\r\nThe essential aspect of all this wild and windy business of the sexual\r\nrelations is, after all, births. Upon this plain fact the people of the\r\nemergent New Republic will unhesitatingly go. The pre-eminent value of\r\nsexual questions in morality lies in the fact that the lives which will\r\nconstitute the future are involved. If they are not involved, if we can\r\ndissociate this relationship from this issue, then sexual questions\r\nbecome of no more importance than the morality of one's deportment at\r\nchess, or the general morality of outdoor games. Indeed, then the\r\nquestion of sexual relationships would be entirely on all fours with,\r\nand probably very analogous to, the question of golf. In each case it\r\nwould be for the medical man and the psychologist to decide how far the\r\nthing was wholesome and permissible, and how far it was an aggressive\r\nbad habit and an absorbing waste of time and energy. An able-bodied man\r\ncontinually addicted to love-making that had no result in offspring\r\nwould be just as silly and morally objectionable as an able-bodied man\r\nwho devoted his chief energies to hitting little balls over golf-links.\r\nBut no more. Both would probably be wasting the lives of other human\r\nbeings--the golfer must employ his caddie. It is entirely the matter of\r\nbirths, and a further consideration to be presently discussed, that\r\nmakes this analogy untrue. It does not, however, make it so untrue as to\r\ndo away with the probability that in many cases the emergent men of the\r\nnew time will consider sterile gratification a moral and legitimate\r\nthing. St. Paul tells us that it is better to marry than to burn, but to\r\nbeget children on that account will appear, I imagine, to these coming\r\nmen as an absolutely loathsome proceeding. They will stifle no spread of\r\nknowledge that will diminish the swarming misery of childhood in the\r\nslums, they will regard the disinclination of the witless \"Society\"\r\nwoman to become a mother as a most amiable trait in her folly. In our\r\nbashfulness about these things we talk an abominable lot of nonsense;\r\nall this uproar one hears about the Rapid Multiplication of the Unfit\r\nand the future of the lower races takes on an entirely different\r\ncomplexion directly we face known, if indelicate, facts. Most of the\r\nhuman types, that by civilized standards are undesirable, are quite\r\nwilling to die out through such suppressions if the world will only\r\nencourage them a little. They multiply in sheer ignorance, but they do\r\nnot desire multiplication even now, and they can easily be made to dread\r\nit. Sensuality aims not at life, but at itself. I believe that the men\r\nof the New Republic will deliberately shape their public policy along\r\nthese lines. They will rout out and illuminate urban rookeries and all\r\nplaces where the base can drift to multiply; they will contrive a land\r\nlegislation that will keep the black, or yellow, or mean-white squatter\r\non the move; they will see to it that no parent can make a profit out of\r\na child, so that childbearing shall cease to be a hopeful speculation\r\nfor the unemployed poor; and they will make the maintenance of a child\r\nthe first charge upon the parents who have brought it into the world.\r\nOnly in this way can progress escape being clogged by the products of\r\nthe security it creates. The development of science has lifted famine\r\nand pestilence from the shoulders of man, and it will yet lift war--for\r\nsome other end than to give him a spell of promiscuous and finally cruel\r\nand horrible reproduction.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the sentimentalist and all whose moral sense has been\r\nvigorously trained in the old school will find this rather a dreadful\r\nsuggestion; it amounts to saying that for the Abyss to become a \"hotbed\"\r\nof sterile immorality will fall in with the deliberate policy of the\r\nruling class in the days to come. At any rate, it will be a terminating\r\nevil. At present the Abyss is a hotbed breeding undesirable and too\r\noften fearfully miserable children. _That_ is something more than a\r\nsentimental horror. Under the really very horrible morality of to-day,\r\nthe spectacle of a mean-spirited, under-sized, diseased little man,\r\nquite incapable of earning a decent living even for himself, married to\r\nsome underfed, ignorant, ill-shaped, plain and diseased little woman,\r\nand guilty of the lives of ten or twelve ugly ailing children, is\r\nregarded as an extremely edifying spectacle, and the two parents\r\nconsider their reproductive excesses as giving them a distinct claim\r\nupon less fecund and more prosperous people. Benevolent persons throw\r\nthemselves with peculiar ardour into a case of this sort, and quite\r\npassionate efforts are made to strengthen the mother against further\r\neventualities and protect the children until they attain to nubile\r\nyears. Until the attention of the benevolent persons is presently\r\ndistracted by a new case.... Yet so powerful is the suggestion of\r\ncurrent opinions that few people seem to see nowadays just what a\r\nhorrible and criminal thing this sort of family, seen from the point of\r\nview of social physiology, appears.\r\n\r\nAnd directly such principles as these come into effective operation, and\r\nI believe that the next hundred years will see this new phase of the\r\nhuman history beginning, there will recommence a process of physical and\r\nmental improvement in mankind, a raising and elaboration of the average\r\nman, that has virtually been in suspense during the greater portion of\r\nthe historical period. It is possible that in the last hundred years, in\r\nthe more civilized states of the world, the average of humanity has\r\npositively fallen. All our philanthropists, all our religious teachers,\r\nseem to be in a sort of informal conspiracy to preserve an atmosphere of\r\nmystical ignorance about these matters, which, in view of the\r\nirresistible nature of the sexual impulse, results in a swelling tide of\r\nmiserable little lives. Consider what it will mean to have perhaps half\r\nthe population of the world, in every generation, restrained from or\r\ntempted to evade reproduction! This thing, this euthanasia of the weak\r\nand sensual, is possible. On the principles that will probably animate\r\nthe predominant classes of the new time, it will be permissible, and I\r\nhave little or no doubt that in the future it will be planned and\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nIf birth were all the making of a civilized man, the men of the future,\r\non the general principles we have imputed to them, would under no\r\ncircumstances find the birth of a child, healthy in body and brain, more\r\nthan the most venial of offences. But birth gives only the beginning,\r\nthe raw material, of a civilized man. The perfect civilized man is not\r\nonly a sound strong body but a very elaborate fabric of mind. He is a\r\nfabric of moral suggestions that become mental habits, a magazine of\r\nmore or less systematized ideas, a scheme of knowledge and training and\r\nan æsthetic culture. He is the child not only of parents but of a home\r\nand of an education. He has to be carefully guarded from physical and\r\nmoral contagions. A reasonable probability of ensuring home and\r\neducation and protection without any parasitic dependence on people\r\noutside the kin of the child, will be a necessary condition to a moral\r\nbirth under such general principles as we have supposed. Now, this\r\nsweeps out of reason any such promiscuity of healthy people as the late\r\nMr. Grant Allen is supposed to have advocated--but, so far as I can\r\nunderstand him, did not. But whether it works out to the taking over of\r\nthe permanent monogamic marriage of the old morality, as a going\r\nconcern, is another matter. Upon this matter I must confess my views of\r\nthe trend of things in the future do not seem to be finally shaped. The\r\nquestion involves very obscure physiological and psychological\r\nconsiderations. A man who aims to become a novelist naturally pries into\r\nthese matters whenever he can, but the vital facts are very often hard\r\nto come by. It is probable that a great number of people could be paired\r\noff in couples who would make permanently happy and successful monogamic\r\nhomes for their sound and healthy children. At any rate, if a certain\r\nfreedom of regrouping were possible within a time limit, this might be\r\nso. But I am convinced that a large proportion of married couples in the\r\nworld to-day are not completely and happily matched, that there is much\r\nmutual limitation, mutual annulment and mutual exasperation. Home with\r\nan atmosphere of contention is worse than none for the child, and it is\r\nthe interest of the child, and that alone, that will be the test of all\r\nthese things. I do not think that the arrangement in couples is\r\nuniversally applicable, or that celibacy (tempered by sterile vice)\r\nshould be its only alternative. Nor can I see why the union of two\r\nchildless people should have an indissoluble permanence or prohibit an\r\nampler grouping. The question is greatly complicated by the economic\r\ndisadvantage of women, which makes wifehood the chief feminine\r\nprofession, while only for an incidental sort of man is marriage a\r\nsource of income, and further by the fact that most women have a period\r\nof maximum attractiveness after which it would be grossly unfair to cast\r\nthem aside. From the point of view we are discussing, the efficient\r\nmother who can make the best of her children, is the most important sort\r\nof person in the state. She is a primary necessity to the coming\r\ncivilization. Can the wife in any sort of polygamic arrangement, or a\r\nwoman of no assured status, attain to the maternal possibilities of the\r\nideal monogamic wife? One is disposed to answer, No. But then, on the\r\nother hand, does the ordinary monogamic wife do that? We are dealing\r\nwith the finer people of the future, strongly individualized people, who\r\nwill be much freer from stereotyped moral suggestions and much less\r\ninclined to be dealt with wholesale than the people of to-day.\r\n\r\nI have already shown cause in these Anticipations to expect a period of\r\ndisorder and hypocrisy in matters of sexual morality. I am inclined to\r\nthink that, when the New Republic emerges on the other side of this\r\ndisorder, there will be a great number of marriage contracts possible\r\nbetween men and women, and that the strong arm of the State will insist\r\nonly upon one thing--the security and welfare of the child. The\r\ninevitable removal of births from the sphere of an uncontrollable\r\nProvidence to the category of deliberate acts, will enormously enhance\r\nthe responsibility of the parent--and of the State that has failed to\r\nadequately discourage the philoprogenitiveness of the parent--towards\r\nthe child. Having permitted the child to come into existence, public\r\npolicy and the older standard of justice alike demand, under these new\r\nconditions, that it must be fed, cherished, and educated, not merely up\r\nto a respectable minimum, but to the full height of its possibilities.\r\nThe State will, therefore, be the reserve guardian of all children. If\r\nthey are being undernourished, if their education is being neglected,\r\nthe State will step in, take over the responsibility of their\r\nmanagement, and enforce their charge upon the parents. The first\r\nliability of a parent will be to his child, and for his child; even the\r\ndues of that darling of our current law, the landlord, will stand second\r\nto that. This conception of the responsibility of the parents and the\r\nState to the child and the future runs quite counter to the general\r\nideas of to-day. These general ideas distort grim realities. Under the\r\nmost pious and amiable professions, all the Christian states of to-day\r\nare, as a matter of fact, engaged in slave-breeding. The chief result,\r\nthough of course it is not the intention, of the activities of priest\r\nand moralist to-day in these matters, is to lure a vast multitude of\r\nlittle souls into this world, for whom there is neither sufficient food,\r\nnor love, nor schools, nor any prospect at all in life but the\r\ninsufficient bread of servitude. It is a result that endears religion\r\nand purity to the sweating employer, and leads unimaginative bishops,\r\nwho have never missed a meal in their lives, and who know nothing of the\r\nindescribable bitterness of a handicapped entry into this world, to draw\r\na complacent contrast with irreligious France. It is a result that must\r\nnecessarily be recognized in its reality, and faced by these men who\r\nwill presently emerge to rule the world; men who will have neither the\r\nplea of ignorance, nor moral stupidity, nor dogmatic revelation to\r\nexcuse such elaborate cruelty.\r\n\r\nAnd having set themselves in these ways to raise the quality of human\r\nbirth, the New Republicans will see to it that the children who do at\r\nlast effectually get born come into a world of spacious opportunity. The\r\nhalf-educated, unskilled pretenders, professing impossible creeds and\r\npropounding ridiculous curricula, to whom the unhappy parents of to-day\r\nmust needs entrust the intelligences of their children; these\r\nheavy-handed barber-surgeons of the mind, these schoolmasters, with\r\ntheir ragtag and bobtail of sweated and unqualified assistants, will be\r\nsucceeded by capable, self-respecting men and women, constituting the\r\nmost important profession of the world. The windy pretences of \"forming\r\ncharacter,\" supplying moral training, and so forth, under which the\r\neducationalist of to-day conceals the fact that he is incapable of his\r\nproper task of training, developing and equipping the mind, will no\r\nlonger be made by the teacher. Nor will the teacher be permitted to\r\nsubordinate his duties to the entirely irrelevant business of his\r\npupils' sports. The teacher will teach, and confine his moral training,\r\nbeyond enforcing truth and discipline, to the exhibition of a capable\r\nperson doing his duty as well as it can be done. He will know that his\r\nutmost province is only a part of the educational process, that equally\r\nimportant educational influences are the home and the world of thought\r\nabout the pupil and himself. The whole world will be thinking and\r\nlearning; the old idea of \"completing\" one's education will have\r\nvanished with the fancy of a static universe; every school will be a\r\npreparatory school, every college. The school and college will probably\r\ngive only the keys and apparatus of thought, a necessary language or so,\r\nthoroughly done, a sound mathematical training, drawing, a wide and\r\nreasoned view of philosophy, some good exercises in dialectics, a\r\ntraining in the use of those stores of fact that science has made. So\r\nequipped, the young man and young woman will go on to the technical\r\nschool of their chosen profession, and to the criticism of contemporary\r\npractice for their special efficiency, and to the literature of\r\ncontemporary thought for their general development....\r\n\r\nAnd while the emergent New Republic is deciding to provide for the\r\nswarming inferiority of the Abyss, and developing the morality and\r\neducational system of the future, in this fashion, it will be attacking\r\nthat mass of irresponsible property that is so unavoidable and so\r\nthreatening under present conditions. The attack will, of course, be\r\nmade along lines that the developing science of economics will trace in\r\nthe days immediately before us. A scheme of death duties and of heavy\r\ngraduated taxes upon irresponsible incomes, with, perhaps, in addition,\r\na system of terminable liability for borrowers, will probably suffice to\r\ncontrol the growth of this creditor elephantiasis. The detailed\r\ncontrivances are for the specialist to make. If there is such a thing as\r\nbitterness in the public acts of the New Republicans, it will probably\r\nbe found in the measures that will be directed against those who are\r\nparasitic, or who attempt to be parasitic, upon the social body, either\r\nby means of gambling, by manipulating the medium of exchange, or by such\r\ninterventions upon legitimate transactions as, for example, the legal\r\ntrade union in Great Britain contrives in the case of house property and\r\nland. Simply because he fails more often than he succeeds, there is\r\nstill a disposition among sentimental people to regard the gambler or\r\nthe speculator as rather a dashing, adventurous sort of person, and to\r\ncontrast his picturesque gallantry with the sober certainties of honest\r\nmen. The men of the New Republic will be obtuse to the glamour of such\r\nromance; they will regard the gambler simply as a mean creature who\r\nhangs about the social body in the hope of getting something for\r\nnothing, who runs risks to filch the possessions of other men, exactly\r\nas a thief does. They will put the two on a footing, and the generous\r\ngambler, like the kindly drunkard, in the face of their effectual\r\nprovision for his little weakness, will cease to complain that his worst\r\nenemy is himself. And, in dealing with speculation, the New Republic\r\nwill have the power of an assured faith and purpose, and the resources\r\nof an economic science that is as yet only in its infancy. In such\r\nmatters the New Republic will entertain no superstition of _laissez\r\nfaire_. Money and credit are as much human contrivances as bicycles, and\r\nas liable to expansion and modification as any other sort of prevalent\r\nbut imperfect machine.\r\n\r\nAnd how will the New Republic treat the inferior races? How will it deal\r\nwith the black? how will it deal with the yellow man? how will it tackle\r\nthat alleged termite in the civilized woodwork, the Jew? Certainly not\r\nas races at all. It will aim to establish, and it will at last, though\r\nprobably only after a second century has passed, establish a world-state\r\nwith a common language and a common rule. All over the world its roads,\r\nits standards, its laws, and its apparatus of control will run. It will,\r\nI have said, make the multiplication of those who fall behind a certain\r\nstandard of social efficiency unpleasant and difficult, and it will have\r\ncast aside any coddling laws to save adult men from themselves.[52] It\r\nwill tolerate no dark corners where the people of the Abyss may fester,\r\nno vast diffused slums of peasant proprietors, no stagnant\r\nplague-preserves. Whatever men may come into its efficient citizenship\r\nit will let come--white, black, red, or brown; the efficiency will be\r\nthe test. And the Jew also it will treat as any other man. It is said\r\nthat the Jew is incurably a parasite on the apparatus of credit. If\r\nthere are parasites on the apparatus of credit, that is a reason for the\r\nlegislative cleaning of the apparatus of credit, but it is no reason for\r\nthe special treatment of the Jew. If the Jew has a certain incurable\r\ntendency to social parasitism, and we make social parasitism impossible,\r\nwe shall abolish the Jew, and if he has not, there is no need to abolish\r\nthe Jew. We are much more likely to find we have abolished the Caucasian\r\nsolicitor. I really do not understand the exceptional attitude people\r\ntake up against the Jews. There is something very ugly about many Jewish\r\nfaces, but there are Gentile faces just as coarse and gross. The Jew\r\nasserts himself in relation to his nationality with a singular\r\ntactlessness, but it is hardly for the English to blame that. Many Jews\r\nare intensely vulgar in dress and bearing, materialistic in thought, and\r\ncunning and base in method, but no more so than many Gentiles. The Jew\r\nis mentally and physically precocious, and he ages and dies sooner than\r\nthe average European, but in that and in a certain disingenuousness he\r\nis simply on all fours with the short, dark Welsh. He foregathers with\r\nthose of his own nation, and favours them against the stranger, but so\r\ndo the Scotch. I see nothing in his curious, dispersed nationality to\r\ndread or dislike. He is a remnant and legacy of mediævalism, a\r\nsentimentalist, perhaps, but no furtive plotter against the present\r\nprogress of things. He was the mediæval Liberal; his persistent\r\nexistence gave the lie to Catholic pretensions all through the days of\r\ntheir ascendency, and to-day he gives the lie to all our yapping\r\n\"nationalisms,\" and sketches in his dispersed sympathies the coming of\r\nthe world-state. He has never been known to burke a school. Much of the\r\nJew's usury is no more than social scavenging. The Jew will probably\r\nlose much of his particularism, intermarry with Gentiles, and cease to\r\nbe a physically distinct element in human affairs in a century or so.\r\nBut much of his moral tradition will, I hope, never die.... And for the\r\nrest, those swarms of black, and brown, and dirty-white, and yellow\r\npeople, who do not come into the new needs of efficiency?\r\n\r\nWell, the world is a world, not a charitable institution, and I take it\r\nthey will have to go. The whole tenor and meaning of the world, as I see\r\nit, is that they have to go. So far as they fail to develop sane,\r\nvigorous, and distinctive personalities for the great world of the\r\nfuture, it is their portion to die out and disappear.\r\n\r\nThe world has a purpose greater than happiness; our lives are to serve\r\nGod's purpose, and that purpose aims not at man as an end, but works\r\nthrough him to greater issues.... This, I believe, will be the\r\ndistinctive quality of the New Republican's belief. And, for that\r\nreason, I have not even speculated whether he will hold any belief in\r\nhuman immortality or no. He will certainly not believe there is any\r\n_post mortem_ state of rewards and punishments because of his faith in\r\nthe sanity of God, and I do not see how he will trace any reaction\r\nbetween this world and whatever world there may be of disembodied lives.\r\nActive and capable men of all forms of religious profession to-day tend\r\nin practice to disregard the question of immortality altogether. So, to\r\na greater degree, will the kinetic men of the coming time. We may find\r\nthat issue interesting enough when we turn over the leaf, but at present\r\nwe have not turned over the leaf. On this side, in this life, the\r\nrelevancy of things points not in the slightest towards the immortality\r\nof our egotisms, but convergently and overpoweringly to the future of\r\nour race, to that spacious future, of which these weak, ambitious\r\nAnticipations are, as it were, the dim reflection seen in a shallow and\r\ntroubled pool.\r\n\r\nFor that future these men will live and die.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] As, for example, that God is an omniscient mind. This is the last\r\nvestige of that barbaric theology which regarded God as a vigorous but\r\nuncertain old gentleman with a beard and an inordinate lust for praise\r\nand propitiation. The modern idea is, indeed, scarcely more reasonable\r\nthan the one it has replaced. A mind thinks, and feels, and wills; it\r\npasses from phase to phase; thinking and willing are a succession of\r\nmental states which follow and replace one another. But omniscience is a\r\ncomplete knowledge, not only of the present state, but of all past and\r\nfuture states, and, since it is all there at any moment, it cannot\r\nconceivably pass from phase to phase, it is stagnant, infinite, and\r\neternal. An omniscient mind is as impossible, therefore, as an\r\nomnipresent moving body. God is outside our mental scope; only by faith\r\ncan we attain Him; our most lucid moments serve only to render clearer\r\nHis inaccessibility to our intelligence. We stand a little way up in a\r\nscale of existences that may, indeed, point towards Him, but can never\r\nbring Him to our scope. As the fulness of the conscious mental existence\r\nof a man stands to the subconscious activities of an amoeba or of a\r\nvisceral ganglion cell, so our reason forces us to admit other possible\r\nmental existences may stand to us. But such an existence, inconceivably\r\ngreat as it would be to us, would be scarcely nearer that transcendental\r\nGod in whom the serious men of the future will, as a class, believe.\r\n\r\n[51] It is an interesting byway from our main thesis to speculate on the\r\nspiritual pathology of the functionless wealthy, the half-educated\r\nindependent women of the middle class, and the people of the Abyss.\r\nWhile the segregating new middle class, whose religious and moral\r\ndevelopment forms our main interest, is developing its spacious and\r\nconfident Theism, there will, I imagine, be a steady decay in the\r\nvarious Protestant congregations. They have played a noble part in the\r\nhistory of the world, their spirit will live for ever, but their formulæ\r\nand organization wax old like a garment. Their moral austerity--that\r\ntouch of contempt for the unsubstantial æsthetic, which has always\r\ndistinguished Protestantism--is naturally repellent to the irresponsible\r\nrich and to artistic people of the weaker type, and the face of\r\nProtestantism has ever been firm even to hardness against the\r\nself-indulgent, the idler, and the prolific, useless poor. The rich as a\r\nclass and the people of the Abyss, so far as they move towards any\r\nexisting religious body, will be attracted by the moral kindliness, the\r\npicturesque organization and venerable tradition of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. We are only in the very beginning of a great Roman Catholic\r\nrevival. The diversified countryside of the coming time will show many a\r\nsplendid cathedral, many an elaborate monastic palace, towering amidst\r\nthe abounding colleges and technical schools. Along the moving platforms\r\nof the urban centre, and athwart the shining advertisements that will\r\nadorn them, will go the ceremonial procession, all glorious with banners\r\nand censer-bearers, and the meek blue-shaven priests and barefooted,\r\nrope-girdled, holy men. And the artful politician of the coming days,\r\nuntil the broom of the New Republic sweep him up, will arrange the\r\nmiraculous planks of his platform always with an eye upon the priest.\r\nWithin the ample sheltering arms of the Mother Church many eccentric\r\ncults will develop. The curious may study the works of M. Huysmans to\r\nlearn of the mystical propitiation of God, Who made heaven and earth, by\r\nthe bedsores of hysterical girls. The future as I see it swarms with\r\nDurtals and Sister Teresas; countless ecstatic nuns, holding their Maker\r\nas it were _in deliciæ_, will shelter from the world in simple but\r\ncostly refuges of refined austerity. Where miracles are needed, miracles\r\nwill occur.\r\n\r\nExcept for a few queer people, nourished on \"Maria Monk\" and suchlike\r\nanti-papal pornography, I doubt if there will be any Protestants left\r\namong the irresponsible rich. Those who do not follow the main current\r\nwill probably take up with weird science-denouncing sects of the\r\nfaith-healing type, or with such pseudo-scientific gibberish as\r\nTheosophy. Mrs. Piper (in an inelegant attitude and with only the whites\r\nof her eyes showing) has restored the waning faith of Professor James in\r\nhuman immortality, and I do not see why that lady should stick at one\r\ndogma amidst the present quite insatiable demand for creeds. Shintoism\r\nand either a cleaned or, more probably, a scented Obi, might in vigorous\r\nhands be pushed to a very considerable success in the coming years; and\r\nI do not see any absolute impossibility in the idea of an after-dinner\r\nwitch-smelling in Park Lane with a witchdoctor dressed in feathers. It\r\nmight be made amazingly picturesque. People would attend it with an air\r\nof intellectual liberality, not, of course, believing in it absolutely,\r\nbut admitting \"there must be Something in it.\" That Something in it!\r\n\"The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God,\" and after that he is\r\nready to do anything with his mind and soul. It is by faith we\r\ndisbelieve.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, there will be much outspoken Atheism and Anti-religion\r\nof the type of the Parisian Devil-Worship imbecilities. Young men of\r\nmeans will determine to be \"wicked.\" They will do silly things that will\r\nstrike them as being indecent and blasphemous and dreadful--black masses\r\nand suchlike nonsense--and then they will get scared. The sort of thing\r\nit will be to shock orthodox maiden aunts and make Olympus ring with\r\nlaughter. A taking sort of nonsense already loose, I find, among very\r\nyoung men is to say, \"Understand, I am non-moral.\" Two thoroughly\r\nrespectable young gentlemen coming from quite different circles have\r\nrecently introduced their souls to me in this same formula. Both, I\r\nrejoice to remark, are married, both are steady and industrious young\r\nmen, trustworthy in word and contract, dressed in accordance with\r\ncurrent conceptions, and behaving with perfect decorum. One, no doubt\r\nfor sinister ends, aspires to better the world through a Socialistic\r\npropaganda. That is all. But in a tight corner some day that silly\r\nlittle formula may just suffice to trip up one or other of these men. To\r\nmany of the irresponsible rich, however, that little \"Understand, I am\r\nnon-moral\" may prove of priceless worth.\r\n\r\n[52] _Vide_ Mr. Archdall Read's excellent and suggestive book, \"The\r\nPresent Evolution of Man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED, LONDON AND BECCLES.",
