I fear we shall never quite\r\n    understand each other.\"\r\n\r\n    --DARWIN TO WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the period covered by the reception, exposition, and gradual\r\nacceptance of the theory of Natural Selection, both Wallace and Darwin\r\nwere much occupied with closely allied scientific work.\r\n\r\nThe publication in 1859 of the \"Origin of Species\"[1] marked a distinct\r\nperiod in the course of Darwin's scientific labours; his previous\r\npublications had, in a measure, prepared the way for this, and those\r\nwhich immediately followed were branches growing out from the main line\r\nof thought and argument contained in the \"Origin,\" an overflow of the\r\n\"mass of facts\" patiently gathered during the preceding years. With\r\nWallace, the end of the first period of his literary work was completed\r\nby the publication of his two large volumes on \"The Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals,\" towards which all his previous thought and\r\nwritings had tended, and from which, again, came other valuable works\r\nleading up to the publication of \"Darwinism\" (1889).\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Darwin and Wallace, on their respective\r\nreturns to England, after many years spent in journeyings by land and\r\nsea and in laborious research, found the first few months fully occupied\r\nin going over their large and varied collections, sorting and arranging\r\nwith scrupulous care the rare specimens they had taken, and in\r\ndiscovering the right men to name and classify them into correct groups.\r\n\r\nAt this point it will be useful to arrange Darwin's writings under three\r\nheads, namely: (1) His zoological and geological books, including \"The\r\nVoyage of the _Beagle_\" (published in 1839), \"Coral Reefs\" (1842), and\r\n\"Geological Observations on South America\" (1846). In this year he also\r\nbegan his work on Barnacles, which was published in 1854; and in\r\naddition to the steady work on the \"Origin of Species\" from 1837\r\nonwards, his observations on \"Earthworms,\" not published until 1881,\r\nformed a distinct phase of his study during the whole of these years\r\n(1839-59). (2) As a natural sequence we have \"Variations of Animals and\r\nPlants under Domestication\" (1868), \"The Descent of Man\" (1871), and\r\n\"The Expression of the Emotions\" (1872). (3) What may be termed his\r\nbotanical works, largely influenced by his evolutionary ideas, which\r\ninclude \"The Fertilisation of Orchids\" (1862), \"Movements and Habits of\r\nClimbing Plants\" (1875), \"Insectivorous Plants\" (1876), \"The Different\r\nForms of Flowers and Plants of the same Species\" (1877), and \"The Power\r\nof Movement in Plants\" (1880).\r\n\r\nA different order, equally characteristic, is discovered in Wallace's\r\nwritings, and it is to be noted that while Darwin devoted himself\r\nentirely to scientific subjects, Wallace diverged at intervals from\r\nnatural science to what may be termed the scientific consideration of\r\nsocial conditions, in addition to his researches into spiritualistic\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe many enticing interests arising out of the classifying of his birds\r\nand insects led Wallace to the conclusion that it would be best to\r\npostpone the writing of his book on the Malay Archipelago until he could\r\nembody in it the more generally important results derived from the\r\ndetailed study of certain portions of his collections. Thus it was not\r\nuntil seven years later (1869) that this complete sketch of his travels\r\n\"from the point of view of the philosophic naturalist\" appeared.\r\n\r\nBetween 1862 and 1867 he wrote a number of articles which were published\r\nin various journals and magazines, and he read some important papers\r\nbefore the Linnean, Entomological, and other learned Societies. These\r\nincluded several on physical and zoological geography; six on questions\r\nof anthropology; and five or six dealing with special applications of\r\nNatural Selection. As these papers \"discussed matters of considerable\r\ninterest and novelty,\" such a summary of them may be given as will serve\r\nto indicate their value to natural science.\r\n\r\nThe first of them, read before the Zoological Society in January, 1863,\r\ngave some detailed information about his collection of birds brought\r\nfrom Buru. In this he showed that the island was originally one of the\r\nMoluccan group, as every bird found there which was not widely\r\ndistributed was either identical with or closely allied to Moluccan\r\nspecies, while none had special affinities with Celebes. It was clear,\r\nthen, that this island formed the most westerly outlier of the Moluccan\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nThe next paper of importance, read before the same Society in November\r\n(1863), was on the birds of the chain of islands extending from Lombok\r\nto the great island of Timor. This included a list of 186 species of\r\nbirds, of which twenty-nine were altogether new. A special feature of\r\nthe paper was that it enabled him to mark out precisely the boundary\r\nline between the Indian and Australian zoological regions, and to trace\r\nthe derivation of the rather peculiar fauna of these islands, partly\r\nfrom Australia and partly from the Moluccas, but with a strong recent\r\nmigration of Javanese species due to the very narrow straits separating\r\nmost of the islands from each other. In \"My Life\" some interesting\r\ntables are given to illustrate how the two streams of immigration\r\nentered these islands, and further that \"as its geological structure\r\nshows  ... Timor is the older island and received immigrants from\r\nAustralia at a period when, probably, Lombok and Flores had not come\r\ninto existence or were unhabitable.... We can,\" he says, \"feel confident\r\nthat Timor has not been connected with Australia, because it has none of\r\nthe peculiar Australian mammalia, and also because many of the commonest\r\nand most widespread groups of Australian birds are entirely wanting.\"[2]\r\n\r\nTwo other papers, dealing with parrots and pigeons respectively\r\n(1864-5), were thought by Wallace himself to be among the most important\r\nof his studies of geographical distribution. Writing of them he says:\r\n\"These peculiarities of distribution and coloration in two such very\r\ndiverse groups of birds interested me greatly, and I endeavoured to\r\nexplain them in accordance with the laws of Natural Selection.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1864, having begun to make a special study of his collection\r\nof butterflies, he prepared a paper for the Linnean Society on \"The\r\nMalayan Papilionidæ, as illustrating the Theory of Natural Selection.\"\r\nThe introductory portion of this paper appeared in the first edition of\r\nhis volume entitled \"Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection\"\r\n(1870), but it was omitted in later editions as being too technical for\r\nthe general reader. From certain remarks found here and there, both in\r\n\"My Life\" and other works, butterflies would appear to have had a\r\nspecial charm and attraction for Wallace. Their varied and gorgeous\r\ncolourings were a ceaseless delight to his eye, and when describing them\r\none feels the sense of pleasure which this gave him, together with the\r\nrecollection of the far-off haunts in which he had first discovered\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis series of papers on birds and insects, with others on the physical\r\ngeography of the Archipelago and its various races of man, furnished all\r\nthe necessary materials for the general sketch of the natural history of\r\nthese islands, and the many problems arising therefrom, which made the\r\n\"Malay Archipelago\" the most popular of his books. In addition to his\r\nown personal knowledge, however, some interesting comparisons are drawn\r\nbetween the accounts given by early explorers and the impressions left\r\non his own mind by the same places and people. On the publication of\r\nthis work, in 1869, extensive and highly appreciative reviews appeared\r\nin all the leading papers and journals, and to-day it is still looked\r\nupon as one of the most trustworthy and informative books of travel.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Malay Archipelago\" was in progress, a lengthy article on\r\n\"Geological Climates and the Origin of Species\" (which formed the\r\nfoundation for \"Island Life\" twelve years later) appeared in the\r\n_Quarterly Review_ (April, 1869). Several references in this to the\r\n\"Principles of Geology\"--Sir Charles Lyell's great work--gave much\r\nsatisfaction both to Lyell and to Darwin. The underlying argument was a\r\ncombination of the views held by Sir Charles Lyell and Mr. Croll\r\nrespectively in relation to the glacial epoch, and the great effect of\r\nchanged distribution of sea and land, or of differences of altitude, and\r\nhow by combining the two a better explanation could be arrived at than\r\nby accepting each theory on its own basis.\r\n\r\nHis next publication of importance was the volume entitled\r\n\"Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,\" consisting of ten\r\nessays (all of which had previously appeared in various periodicals)\r\narranged in the following order:\r\n\r\n1. On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species.\r\n\r\n2. On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original\r\nType.\r\n\r\n3. Mimicry, and other Protective Resemblances among Animals.\r\n\r\n4. The Malayan Papilionidæ.\r\n\r\n5. Instinct in Man and Animals.\r\n\r\n6. The Philosophy of Birds' Nests.\r\n\r\n7. A Theory of Birds' Nests.\r\n\r\n8. Creation by Law.\r\n\r\n9. The Development of Human Races under the Law of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\n10. The Limits of Natural Selection as applied to Man.\r\n\r\nHis reasons for publishing this work were, first, that the first two\r\npapers of the series had gained him the reputation of being an\r\noriginator of the theory of Natural Selection, and, secondly, that there\r\nwere a few important points relating to the origin of life and\r\nconsciousness and the mental and moral qualities of man and other views\r\non which he entirely differed from Darwin.\r\n\r\nThough in later years Wallace's convictions developed considerably with\r\nregard to the spiritual aspect of man's nature, he never deviated from\r\nthe ideas laid down in these essays. Only a very brief outline must\r\nsuffice to convey some of the most important points.\r\n\r\nIn the childhood of the human race, he believed, Natural Selection would\r\noperate mainly on man's body, but in later periods upon the mind. Hence\r\nit would happen that the physical forms of the different races were\r\nearly fixed in a permanent manner. Sharper claws, stronger muscles,\r\nswifter feet and tougher hides determine the survival value of lower\r\nanimals. With man, however, the finer intellect, the readier\r\nadaptability to environment, the greater susceptibility to improvement,\r\nand the elastic capacity for co-ordination, were the qualities which\r\ndetermined his career. Tribes which are weak in these qualities give way\r\nand perish before tribes which are strong in them, whatever advantages\r\nthe former may possess in physical structure. The finest savage has\r\nalways succumbed before the advance of civilisation. \"The Red Indian\r\ngoes down before the white man, and the New Zealander vanishes in\r\npresence of the English settler.\" Nature, careless in this stage of\r\nevolution about the body, selects for survival those varieties of\r\nmankind which excel in mental qualities. Hence it has happened that the\r\nphysical characteristics of the different races, once fixed in very\r\nearly prehistoric times, have never greatly varied. They have passed out\r\nof the range of Natural Selection because they have become comparatively\r\nunimportant in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nAfter going into considerable detail of organic and physical\r\ndevelopment, he says: \"The inference I would draw from this class of\r\nphenomena is, that a superior intelligence has guided the development of\r\nman in a definite direction, and for a special purpose, just as man\r\nguides the development of many animal and vegetable forms.\" Thus he\r\nforeshadows the conclusion, to be more fully developed in \"The World of\r\nLife\" (1910), of an over-ruling God, of the spiritual nature of man, and\r\nof the other world of spiritual beings.\r\n\r\nAn essay that excited special attention was that on Mimicry. The two on\r\nBirds' Nests brought forth some rather heated correspondence from\r\namateur naturalists, to which Wallace replied either by adducing\r\nconfirmation of the facts stated, or by thanking them for the\r\ninformation they had given him.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the paper on Mimicry, it is interesting to note that\r\nthe hypothesis therein adopted was first suggested by H.W. Bates,\r\nWallace's friend and fellow-traveller in South America. The essay under\r\nthis title dealt with the subject in a most fascinating manner, and was\r\nprobably the first to arouse widespread interest in this aspect of\r\nnatural science.\r\n\r\nThe next eight years saw the production of many important and valuable\r\nworks, amongst which the \"Geographical Distribution of Animals\" (1876)\r\noccupies the chief place. This work, though perhaps the least known to\r\nthe average reader, was considered by Wallace to be the most important\r\nscientific work he ever attempted. From references in letters written\r\nduring his stay in the Malay Archipelago, it is clear that the subject\r\nhad a strong attraction for him, and formed a special branch of study\r\nand observation many years before he began to work it out systematically\r\nin writing. His decision to write the book was the outcome of a\r\nsuggestion made to him by Prof. A. Newton and Dr. Sclater about 1872. In\r\naddition to having already expressed his general views on this subject\r\nin various papers and articles, he had, after careful consideration,\r\ncome to adopt Dr. Sclater's division of the earth's surface into six\r\ngreat zoological regions, which he found equally applicable to birds,\r\nmammalia, reptiles, and other great divisions; while at the same time\r\nit helped to explain the apparent contradictions in the distribution of\r\nland animals. Some years later he wrote:\r\n\r\nIn whatever work I have done I have always aimed at systematic\r\narrangement and uniformity of treatment throughout. But here the immense\r\nextent of the subject, the overwhelming mass of detail, and above all\r\nthe excessive diversities in the amount of knowledge of the different\r\nclasses of animals, rendered it quite impossible to treat all alike. My\r\npreliminary studies had already satisfied me that it was quite useless\r\nto attempt to found any conclusions on those groups which were\r\ncomparatively little known, either as regards the proportion of species\r\ncollected and described, or as regards their systematic classification.\r\nIt was also clear that as the present distribution of animals is\r\nnecessarily due to their past distribution, the greatest importance must\r\nbe given to those groups whose fossil remains in the more recent strata\r\nare the most abundant and the best known. These considerations led me to\r\nlimit my work in its detailed systematic groundwork, and study of the\r\nprinciples and law of distribution, to the mammalia and birds, and to\r\napply the principles thus arrived at to an explanation of the\r\ndistribution of other groups, such as reptiles, fresh-water fishes, land\r\nand fresh-water shells, and the best-known insect Orders.\r\n\r\nThere remained another fundamental point to consider. Geographical\r\ndistribution in its practical applications and interest, both to\r\nstudents and to the general reader, consists of two distinct divisions,\r\nor rather, perhaps, may be looked at from two points of view. In the\r\nfirst of these we divide the earth into regions and sub-regions, study\r\nthe causes which have led to the difference in their animal productions,\r\ngive a general account of these, with the amount of resemblance to and\r\ndifference from other regions; and we may also give lists of the\r\nfamilies and genera inhabiting each, with indications as to which are\r\npeculiar and which are also found in adjacent regions. This aspect of\r\nthe study I term zoological geography, and it is that which would be of\r\nmost interest to the resident or travelling naturalist, as it would give\r\nhim, in the most direct and compact form, an indication of the numbers\r\nand kinds of animals he might expect to meet with.[3]\r\n\r\nThe keynote of the general scheme of distribution, as set forth in these\r\ntwo volumes, may be expressed as an endeavour to compare the extinct and\r\nexisting fauna of each country and to trace the course by which what is\r\nnow peculiar to each region had come to assume its present character.\r\nThe main result being that all the higher forms of life seem to have\r\noriginally appeared in the northern hemisphere, which has sent out\r\nmigration after migration to colonise the three southern continents; and\r\nalthough varying considerably from time to time in form and extent, each\r\nhas kept essentially distinct, while at the same time receiving\r\nperiodically wave after wave of fresh animal life from the northward.\r\n\r\nThis again was due to many physical causes such as peninsulas parting\r\nfrom continents as islands, islands joining and making new continents,\r\ncontinents breaking up or effecting junction with or being isolated from\r\none another. Thus Australia received the germ of her present abundant\r\nfauna of pouched mammals when she was part of the Old-World continent,\r\nbut separated from that too soon to receive the various placental\r\nmammals which have, except in her isolated area, superseded those older\r\nforms. So, also, South America, at one time unconnected with North\r\nAmerica, developed her great sloths and armadilloes, and, on fusing with\r\nthe latter, sent her megatheriums to the north, and received mastodons\r\nand large cats in exchange.\r\n\r\nSome of the points, such for instance as the division of the sub-regions\r\ninto which each greater division is separated, gave rise to\r\nconsiderable controversy. Wallace's final estimate of the work stands:\r\n\"No one is more aware than myself of the defects of the work, a\r\nconsiderable portion of which are due to the fact that it was written a\r\nquarter of a century too soon--at a time when both zoological and\r\npalæontological discovery were advancing with great rapidity, while new\r\nand improved classifications of some of the great classes and orders\r\nwere in constant progress. But though many of the details given in these\r\nvolumes would now require alteration, there is no reason to believe that\r\nthe great features of the work and general principles established by it\r\nwill require any important modification.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAbout this time he wrote the article on \"Acclimatisation\" for the\r\n\"Encyclopædia Britannica\"; and another on \"Distribution-Zoology\" for the\r\nsame work. As President of the Biological Section of the British\r\nAssociation he prepared an address for the meeting at Glasgow; wrote a\r\nnumber of articles and reviews, as well as his remarkable book on\r\n\"Miracles and Modern Spiritualism.\" In 1878 he published \"Tropical\r\nNature,\" in which he gave a general sketch of the climate, vegetation,\r\nand animal life of the equatorial zone of the tropics from his own\r\nobservations in both hemispheres. The chief novelty was, according to\r\nhis own opinion, in the chapter on \"climate,\" in which he endeavoured to\r\nshow the exact causes which produce the difference between the uniform\r\nclimate of the equatorial zone, and that of June and July in England.\r\nAlthough at that time _we_ receive actually more of the light and heat\r\nof the sun than does Java or Trinidad in December, yet these places have\r\nthen a mean temperature very much higher than ours. It contained also a\r\nchapter on humming-birds, as illustrating the luxuriance of tropical\r\nnature; and others on the colours of animals and of plants, and on\r\nvarious biological problems.[5]\r\n\r\n\"Island Life\"[6] (published 1880) was begun in 1877, and occupied the\r\ngreater part of the next three years. This had been suggested by certain\r\nnecessary limitations in the writing of \"The Geographical Distribution\r\nof Animals.\" It is a fascinating account of the relations of islands to\r\ncontinents, of their unwritten records of the distribution of plant and\r\nanimal life in the morning time of the earth, of the causes and results\r\nof the glacial period, and of the manner of reckoning the age of the\r\nworld from geological data. It also included several new features of\r\nnatural science, and still retains an important place in scientific\r\nliterature. No better summary can be given than that by the author\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\nIn my \"Geographical Distribution of Animals\" I had, in the first place,\r\ndealt with the larger groups, coming down to families and genera, but\r\ntaking no account of the various problems raised by the distribution of\r\nparticular _species_. In the next place, I had taken little account of\r\nthe various islands of the globe, excepting as forming sub-regions or\r\nparts of sub-regions. But I had long seen the great interest and\r\nimportance of these, and especially of Darwin's great discovery of the\r\ntwo classes into which they are naturally divided--oceanic and\r\ncontinental islands. I had already given lectures on this subject, and\r\nhad become aware of the great interest attaching to them, and the great\r\nlight they threw upon the means of dispersal of animals and plants, as\r\nwell as upon the past changes, both physical and means of dispersal and\r\ncolonisation of animals is so connected with, and often dependent on,\r\nthat of plants, that a consideration of the latter is essential to any\r\nbroad views as to the distribution of life upon the earth, while they\r\nthrow unexpected light upon those exceptional means of dispersal which,\r\nbecause they are exceptional, are often of paramount importance in\r\nleading to the production of new species and in thus determining the\r\nnature of insular floras and faunas.\r\n\r\nHaving no knowledge of scientific botany, it needed some courage, or, as\r\nsome may think, presumption, to deal with this aspect of the problem;\r\nbut  ... I had long been excessively fond of plants, and  ... interested\r\nin their distribution. The subject, too, was easier to deal with, on\r\naccount of the much more complete knowledge of the detailed distribution\r\nof plants than of animals, and also because their classification was in\r\na more advanced and stable condition. Again, some of the most\r\ninteresting islands of the globe had been carefully studied botanically\r\nby such eminent botanists as Sir Joseph Hooker for the Galapagos, New\r\nZealand, Tasmania, and the Antarctic islands; Mr. H.C. Watson for the\r\nAzores; Mr. J.G. Baker for Mauritius and other Mascarene islands; while\r\nthere were floras by competent botanists of the Sandwich Islands,\r\nBermuda and St. Helena....\r\n\r\nBut I also found it necessary to deal with a totally distinct branch of\r\nscience--recent changes of climate as dependent on changes of the\r\nearth's surface, including the causes and effects of the glacial epoch,\r\nsince these were among the most powerful agents in causing the dispersal\r\nof all kinds of organisms, and thus bringing about the actual\r\ndistribution that now prevails. This led me to a careful study of Mr.\r\nJames Croll's remarkable works on the subject of the astronomical causes\r\nof the glacial and interglacial periods.... While differing on certain\r\ndetails, I adopted the main features of his theory, combining with it\r\nthe effects of changes in height and extent of land which form an\r\nimportant adjunct to the meteorological agents....\r\n\r\nBesides this partially new theory of the causes of glacial epochs, the\r\nwork contained a fuller statement of the various kinds of evidence\r\nproving that the great oceanic basins are permanent features of the\r\nearth's surface, than had before been given; also a discussion of the\r\nmode of estimating the duration of geological periods, and some\r\nconsiderations leading to the conclusion that organic change is now less\r\nrapid than the average, and therefore that less time is required for\r\nthis change than has hitherto been thought necessary. I was also, I\r\nbelieve, the first to point out the great difference between the more\r\nancient continental islands and those of more recent origin, with the\r\ninteresting conclusions as to geographical changes afforded by both;\r\nwhile the most important novelty is the theory by which I explained the\r\noccurrence of northern groups of plants in all parts of the southern\r\nhemisphere--a phenomenon which Sir Joseph Hooker had pointed out, but\r\nhad then no means of explaining.[7]\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Wallace wrote a volume on Australasia for Stanford's \"Compendium\r\nof Geography and Travel.\" A later edition was published in 1893, which\r\ncontained in addition to the physical geography, natural history, and\r\ngeology of Australia, a much fuller account of the natives of Australia,\r\nshowing that they are really a primitive type of the great Caucasian\r\nfamily of mankind, and are by no means so low in intellect as had been\r\nusually believed. This view has since been widely accepted.\r\n\r\nHaving, towards the close of 1885, received an invitation from the\r\nLowell Institute, Boston, U.S.A., to deliver a course of lectures in the\r\nautumn and winter of 1886, Wallace decided upon a series which would\r\nembody those theories of evolution with which he was most familiar, with\r\na special one on \"The Darwinian Theory\" illustrated by a set of original\r\ndiagrams on variation. These lectures eventually became merged into the\r\nwell-known book entitled \"Darwinism.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first delivery of his lecture on the \"Darwinian Theory\" at\r\nBoston it was no small pleasure to Wallace to find the audience both\r\nlarge and attentive. One of the newspapers expressed the public\r\nappreciation in the following truly American fashion: \"The first\r\nDarwinian, Wallace, did not leave a leg for anti-Darwinism to stand on\r\nwhen he had got through his first Lowell Lecture last evening. It was a\r\nmasterpiece of condensed statement--as clear and simple as compact--a\r\nmost beautiful specimen of scientific work. Dr. Wallace, though not an\r\norator, is likely to become a favourite as a lecturer, his manner is so\r\ngenuinely modest and straightforward.\"\r\n\r\nWherever he went during his tour of the States this lecture more than\r\nall others attracted and pleased his audiences. Many who had the\r\nopportunity of conversing with him, and others by correspondence,\r\nconfessed that they had not been able to understand the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies\" until they heard the facts explained in such a lucid manner by\r\nhim. It was this fact, therefore, which led him, on his return home in\r\nthe autumn of 1887, to begin the preparation of the book (\"Darwinism\")\r\npublished in 1889. The method he chose was that of following as closely\r\nas possible the lines of thought running through the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" to which he added many new features, in addition to laying\r\nspecial emphasis on the parts which had been most generally\r\nmisunderstood. Indeed, so fairly and impartially did he set forth the\r\ngeneral principles of the Darwinian theory that he was able to say:\r\n\"Some of my critics declare that I am more Darwinian than Darwin\r\nhimself, and in this, I admit, they are not far wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHis one object, as set out in the Preface, was to treat the problem of\r\nthe origin of species from the standpoint reached after nearly thirty\r\nyears of discussion, with an abundance of new facts and the advocacy of\r\nmany new and old theories. As it had frequently been considered a\r\nweakness on Darwin's part that he based his evidence primarily on\r\nexperiments with domesticated animals and cultivated plants, Wallace\r\ndesired to secure a firm foundation for the theory in the variation of\r\norganisms in a state of nature. It was in order to make these facts\r\nintelligible that he introduced a number of diagrams, just as Darwin was\r\naccustomed to appeal to the facts of variation among dogs and pigeons.\r\n\r\nAnother change which he considered important was that of taking the\r\nstruggle for existence first, because this is the fundamental phenomenon\r\non which Natural Selection depends. This, too, had a further advantage\r\nin that, after discussing variations and the effects of artificial\r\nselection, it was possible at once to explain how Natural Selection\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nThe subjects treated with novelty and interest in their important\r\nbearings on the theory of Natural Selection were: (1) A proof that all\r\n_specific_ characters are (or once have been) either useful in\r\nthemselves or correlated with useful characters (Chap. VI.); (2) a proof\r\nthat Natural Selection can, in certain cases, increase the sterility of\r\ncrosses (Chap. VII.); (3) a fuller discussion of the colour relations of\r\nanimals, with additional facts and arguments on the origin of sexual\r\ndifferences of colour (Chaps. VIII.-X.); (4) an attempted solution of\r\nthe difficulty presented by the occurrence of both very simple and\r\ncomplex modes of securing the cross-fertilisation of plants (Chap. XI.);\r\n(5) some fresh facts and arguments on the wind-carriage of seeds, and\r\nits bearing on the wide dispersal of many arctic and alpine plants\r\n(Chap. XII.); (6) some new illustrations of the non-heredity of acquired\r\ncharacters, and a proof that the effects of use and disuse, even if\r\ninherited, must be overpowered by Natural Selection (Chap. XIV.); and\r\n(7) a new argument as to the nature and origin of the moral and\r\nintellectual faculties of man (Chap. XV.).\r\n\r\n\"Although I maintain, and even enforce,\" wrote Wallace, \"my differences\r\nfrom some of Darwin's views, my whole work tends forcibly to illustrate\r\nthe overwhelming importance of Natural Selection over all other agencies\r\nin the production of new species. I thus take up Darwin's earlier\r\nposition, from which he somewhat receded in the later editions of his\r\nworks, on account of criticisms and objections which I have endeavoured\r\nto show are unsound. Even in rejecting that phase of sexual selection\r\ndepending on female choice, I insist on the greater efficacy of Natural\r\nSelection. This is pre-eminently the Darwinian doctrine, and I therefore\r\nclaim for my book the position of being the advocate of pure Darwinism.\"\r\n\r\nIn concluding this section which, like a previous one, touches upon the\r\nintimate relations between Darwin and Wallace, and the points on which\r\nthey agreed or differed, it is well, as the differences have been\r\nexaggerated and misunderstood, to bear in mind his own declaration:\r\n\"None of my differences from Darwin imply any real divergence as to the\r\noverwhelming importance of the great principle of natural selection,\r\nwhile in several directions I believe that I have extended and\r\nstrengthened it.\"[8]\r\n\r\nWith these explanatory notes the reader will now be able to follow the\r\ntwo groups of letters on Natural Selection, Geographical Distribution,\r\nand the Origin of Life and Consciousness which follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III (_Continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Correspondence on Biology, Geographical Distribution, etc.\r\n\r\n[1864-93]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH.

Though I think that there are\r\nsome purely physical modifications that may be shown to result from the\r\ndirect influence of civilisation, yet I think it is quite clear, as you\r\npoint out, that the small amounts of physical differences that have\r\narisen between the various human races are due to the way in which\r\nmental modifications have served in place of physical ones.\r\n\r\nI hope you will pursue the inquiry.

The manner in which you have given Darwin the whole credit\r\nof the theory of Natural Selection is very handsome, but if anyone else\r\nhad done it without allusion to your papers it would have been wrong....\r\nWith many thanks for your most admirable paper, believe me, my dear Sir,\r\never very truly yours,\r\n\r\nCHA. LYELL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR C. LYELL TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_73 Harley Street. March 19, 1867._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--I am citing your two papers in my second volume of\r\nthe new edition of the \"Principles\"--that on the Physical Geography of\r\nthe Malay Archipelago, 1863, and the other on Varieties of Man in ditto,\r\n1864. I am somewhat confounded with the marked line which you draw\r\nbetween the two provinces on each side of the Straits of Lombok. It\r\nseems to me that Darwin and Hooker have scarcely given sufficient weight\r\nto the objection which it affords to some of their arguments. First, in\r\nregard to continental extension, if these straits could form such a\r\nbarrier, it would seem as if nothing short of a land communication could\r\ndo much towards fusing together two distinct faunas and floras. But here\r\ncomes the question--are there any land-quadrupeds in Bali or in Lombok?\r\nI think you told me little was known of the plants, but perhaps you know\r\nsomething of the insects. It is impossible that birds of long flight\r\ncrossing over should not have conveyed the seeds and eggs of some\r\nplants, insects, mollusca, etc. Then the currents would not be idle, and\r\nduring such an eruption as that of Tomboro in Sumbawa all sorts of\r\ndisturbances, aerial, aquatic and terrestrial, would have scattered\r\nanimals and plants.\r\n\r\nWhen I first wrote, thirty-five years ago, I attached great importance\r\nto preoccupancy, and fancied that a body of indigenous plants already\r\nfitted for every available station would prevent an invader, especially\r\nfrom, a quite foreign province, from having a chance of making good his\r\nsettlement in a new country. But Darwin and Hooker contend that\r\ncontinental species which have been improved by a keen and wide\r\ncompetition are most frequently victorious over an insular or more\r\nlimited flora and fauna. Looking, therefore, upon Bali as an outpost of\r\nthe great Old World fauna, it ought to beat Lombok, which only\r\nrepresents a less rich and extensive fauna, namely the Australian.\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps answer that Lombok is an outpost of an army that may\r\nonce have been as multitudinous as that of the old continent, but the\r\nlarger part of the host have been swamped in the Pacific. But they say\r\nthat European forms of animals and plants run wild in Australia and New\r\nZealand, whereas few of the latter can do the same in Europe. In my map\r\nthere is a small island called Nousabali; this ought to make the means\r\nof migration of seeds and animals less difficult. I cannot find that you\r\nsay anywhere what is the depth of the sea between the Straits of Lombok,\r\nbut you mention that it exceeds 100 fathoms. I am quite willing to infer\r\nthat there is a connection between these soundings and the line of\r\ndemarcation between the two zoological provinces, but must we suppose\r\nland communication for all birds of short flight? Must we unite South\r\nAmerica with the Galapagos Islands? Can you refer me to any papers by\r\nyourself which might enlighten me and perhaps answer some of these\r\nqueries? I should have thought that the intercourse even of savage\r\ntribes for tens of thousands of years between neighbouring islands would\r\nhave helped to convey in canoes many animals and plants from one\r\nprovince to another so as to help to confound them. Your hypothesis of\r\nthe gradual advance of two widely separated continents towards each\r\nother seems to be the best that can be offered. You say that a rise of\r\na hundred fathoms would unite the Philippine Islands and Bali to the\r\nIndian region. Is there, then, a depth of 600 feet in that narrow strait\r\nof Bali, which seems in my map only two miles or so in breadth?\r\n\r\nI have [been] confined to the house for a week by a cold or I should\r\nhave tried to see you. I am afraid to go out to-day.--Believe me ever\r\nmost truly yours,\r\n\r\nCHA. LYELL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR C. LYELL TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_73 Harley Street. April 4, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,--I have been reading over again your paper\r\npublished in 1855 in the _Annals_ on \"The Law which has regulated the\r\nIntroduction of New Species\"; passages of which I intend to quote, not\r\nin reference to your priority of publication, but simply because there\r\nare some points laid down more clearly than I can find in the work of\r\nDarwin itself, in regard to the bearing of the geological and zoological\r\nevidence on geographical distribution and the origin of species. I have\r\nbeen looking into Darwin's historical sketch thinking to find some\r\nallusion to your essay at page xx., 4th ed., when he gets to 1855, but I\r\ncan find no allusion to it. Yet surely I remember somewhere a passage in\r\nwhich Darwin says in print that you had told him that in 1855 you meant\r\nby such expressions as \"species being created on the type of\r\npre-existing ones closely allied,\" and by what you say of modified\r\nprototypes, and by the passage in which you ask \"what rudimentary organs\r\nmean if each species has been created independently,\" etc., that new\r\nspecies were created by variation and in the way of ordinary generation.\r\n\r\nYour last letter was a great help to me, for it was a relief to find\r\nthat the Lombok barrier was not so complete as to be a source of\r\ndifficulty. I have also to thank you for your papers, one of which I had\r\nread before in the _Natural History Review_, but I am very glad of a\r\nseparate copy. I am rather perplexed by Darwin speculating on the\r\npossibility of New Zealand having once been united with Australia (p.\r\n446, 4th Ed.). The puzzle is greater than I can get over, even looking\r\nupon it as an oceanic island. Why should there have been no mammalia,\r\nrodents and marsupials, or only one mouse? Even if the Glacial period\r\nwas such that it was enveloped in a Greenlandic winding-sheet, there\r\nwould have been some Antarctic animals? It cannot be modern, seeing the\r\nheight of those alps. It may have been a set of separate smaller\r\nislands, an archipelago since united into fewer. No savages could have\r\nextirpated mammalia, besides we should have found them fossil in the\r\nsame places with all those species of extinct Dinornis which have come\r\nto light. Perhaps you will say that the absence of mammalia in New\r\nCaledonia is a corresponding fact.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of another difficulty. On the hypothesis of the coral\r\nislands being the last remnants of a submerged continent, ought they not\r\nto have in them a crowd of peculiar and endemic types, each rivalling\r\nSt. Helena, instead of which I believe they are very poor [in] peculiar\r\ngenera. Have they all got submerged for a short time during the ups and\r\ndowns to which they have been subjected, Tahiti and some others having\r\nbeen built up by volcanic action in the Pliocene period? Madeira and the\r\nCanaries were islands in the Upper Miocene ocean, and may therefore well\r\nhave peculiar endemic types of very old date, and destroyed elsewhere. I\r\nhave just got in Wollaston's \"Coleoptera Atlantidum,\" and shall be glad\r\nto lend it you when I have read the Introduction. He goes in for\r\ncontinental extension, which only costs him two catastrophes by which\r\nthe union and disunion with the nearest mainland may readily be\r\naccomplished.... --Believe me ever most truly yours,\r\n\r\nCHA. LYELL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR C. LYELL TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_73 Harley Street. May 2, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--I forgot to ask you last night about an ornithological\r\npoint which I have been discussing with the Duke of Argyll. In Chapter\r\nV. of his \"Reign of Law\" (which I should be happy to lend you, if you\r\nhave time to look at it immediately) he treats of humming-birds, saying\r\nthat Gould has made out about 400 species, every one of them very\r\ndistinct from the other, and only one instance, in Ecuadór, of a species\r\nwhich varies in its tail-feathers in such a way as to make it doubtful\r\nwhether it ought to rank as a species, an opinion to which Gould\r\ninclines, or only as a variety or incipient species, as the Duke thinks.\r\nFor the Duke is willing to go so far towards the transmutation theory as\r\nto allow that different humming-birds may have had a common ancestral\r\nstock, provided it be admitted that a new and marked variety appears at\r\nonce with the full distinctness of sex so remarkable in that genus.\r\n\r\nAccording to his notion, the new male variety and the female must both\r\nappear at once, and this new race or species must be regarded as an\r\n\"extraordinary birth.\" My reason for troubling you is merely to learn,\r\nsince you have studied the birds of South America, and I hope collected\r\nsome humming-birds, whether Gould is right in saying that there are so\r\nmany hundred very distinct species without instances of marked varieties\r\nand transitional forms. If this be the case, would it not present us\r\nwith an exception to the rule laid down by Darwin and Hooker that when a\r\ngenus is largely represented in a continuous tract of land the species\r\nof that genus tend to vary?\r\n\r\nI have inquired of Sclater and he tells me that he has a considerable\r\ndistrust of Gould's information on this point, but that he has not\r\nhimself studied humming-birds.\r\n\r\nIn regard to shells, I have always found that dealers have a positive\r\nprejudice against intermediate forms, and one of the most philosophical\r\nof them, now no more, once confessed to me that it was very much against\r\nhis trade interest to give an honest opinion that certain varieties were\r\nnot real species, or that certain forms, made distinct genera by some\r\nconchologists, ought not so to rank. Nine-tenths of his customers, if\r\ntold that it was not a good genus or good species, would say, \"Then I\r\nneed not buy it.\" What they wanted was names, not things. Of course\r\nthere are genera in which the species are much better defined than in\r\nothers, but you would explain this, as Darwin and Hooker do, by the\r\ngreater length of time during which they have existed, or the greater\r\nactivity of changes, organic and inorganic, which have taken place in\r\nthe region inhabited by the generic or family type in question. The\r\nmanufactory of new species has ceased, or nearly so, and in that case I\r\nsuppose a variety is more likely to be one of the transitional links\r\nwhich has not yet been extinguished than the first step towards a new\r\npermanent race or allied species....\r\n\r\nYour last letter will be of great use to me. I had cited the case of\r\nbeetles recovering from immersion of hours in alcohol from my own\r\nexperience, but am glad it strikes you in the same light. McAndrew told\r\nme last night that the littoral shells of the Azores being European, or\r\nrather African, is in favour of a former continental extension, but I\r\nsuspect that the floating of seaweed containing their eggs may dispense\r\nwith the hypothesis of the submersion of 1,200 miles of land once\r\nintervening. I want naturalists carefully to examine floating seaweed\r\nand pumice met with at sea. Tell your correspondents to look out. There\r\nshould be a microscopic examination of both these means of\r\ntransport.--Believe me ever truly yours,\r\n\r\nCHA. LYELL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR C.

LYELL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HERBERT SPENCER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hurstpierpoint, Sussex. October 26, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Spencer,--After leaving you yesterday I thought a little\r\nover your objections to the Duke of Argyll's theory of flight on the\r\nground that it does not apply to insects, and it seems to me that\r\nexactly the same general principles do apply to insects as to birds. I\r\nread over the Duke's book without paying special attention to that part\r\nof it, but as far as I remember, the case of insects offers no\r\ndifficulty in the way of applying his principles. If any wing were a\r\nrigid plane surface, it appears to me that there are only two ways in\r\nwhich it could be made to produce flight. Firstly, on the principle that\r\nthe resistance in a fluid, and I believe also in air, increases in a\r\ngreater ratio than the velocity (? as the square), the descending stroke\r\nmight be more rapid than the ascending one, and the resultant would be\r\nan upward or forward motion. Secondly, some kind of furling or\r\nfeathering by a rotatory motion of the wing might take place on raising\r\nthe wings. I think, however, it is clear that neither of these actions\r\noccurs during the flight of insects. In both slow- and quick-flying\r\nspecies there is no appearance of such a difference of velocity, and I\r\nam not aware that anyone has attempted to prove that it occurs; and the\r\nfact that in so many insects the edges of the fore and hind wings are\r\nconnected together, while their insertions at the base are at some\r\ndistance apart, _entirely precludes a rotation of the wings_. The whole\r\nstructure and form of the wings of insects, moreover, indicate an action\r\nin flight quite analogous to that of birds. I believe that a careful\r\nexamination will show that the wings of almost all insects are slightly\r\nconcave beneath. Further, they are all constructed with a strong and\r\nrigid anterior margin, while the outer and hinder margins are\r\nexceedingly thin and flexible. Yet further, I feel confident (and a\r\nfriend here agrees with me) that they are much more rigid against\r\n_upward_ than against _downward_ pressure. Now in most insects (take a\r\nbutterfly as an example) the body is weighted behind the insertion of\r\nthe wings by the long and heavy abdomen, so as to produce an oblique\r\nposition when freely suspended. There is also much more wing surface\r\nbehind than before the fulcrum. Now if such an insect produces by\r\nmuscular action a regular flapping of the wings, flight must result. At\r\nthe downward stroke the pressure of the air against the hind wings would\r\nraise them all to a nearly horizontal position, and at the same time\r\nbend up their posterior margins a little, producing an upward and onward\r\nmotion. At the upward stroke the pressure on the hind wings would\r\ndepress them considerably into an oblique position, and from their great\r\nflexibility in that direction would bend down their hind margins. The\r\nresultant would be a slightly downward and considerably onward motion,\r\nthe two strokes producing that undulating flight so characteristic of\r\nbutterflies, and so especially observable in the broad-winged tropical\r\nspecies. Now all this is quite conformable to the action of a bird's\r\nwing. The rigid anterior margin, the slender and flexible hind margin;\r\nthe greater resistance to upward than to downward pressure, and the\r\nslight concavity of the under surface, are all characters common to the\r\nwings of birds and most insects, and, considering the totally different\r\nstructure and homologies of the two, I think there is at least an _a\r\npriori_ case for the function they both subserve being dependent upon\r\nthese peculiarities. If I remember rightly, it is on these principles\r\nthat the Duke of Argyll has explained the flight of birds, in which,\r\nhowever, there are of course some specialities depending on the more\r\nperfect organisation of the wing, its greater mobility and flexibility,\r\nits capacity for enlargement and contraction, and the peculiar\r\nconstruction and arrangement of the feathers. These, however, are\r\nmatters of detail; and there are no doubt many and important differences\r\nof detail in the mode of flight of the different types of insects which\r\nwould require a special study of each. It appeared to me that the Duke\r\nof Argyll had given that special study to the flight of birds, and\r\ndeserved praise for having done so successfully, although he may not\r\nhave quite solved the whole problem, or have stated quite accurately the\r\ncomparative importance of the various causes that combine to effect\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n--Believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_57 Queen's Gardens, Bayswater, W. December 5, 1867._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,--I did not answer your last letter, being busy in\r\ngetting out my second edition of \"First Principles.\"\r\n\r\nI was quite aware of the alleged additional cause of flight which you\r\nname, and do not doubt that it is an aid. But I regard it simply as an\r\naid. If you will move an outstretched wing backwards and forwards with\r\nequal velocity, I think you will find that the difference of resistance\r\nis nothing like commensurate with the difference in size between the\r\nmuscles that raise the wings and the muscles that depress them. It seems\r\nto me quite out of the question that the principles of flight are\r\nfundamentally different in a bat and a bird, which they must be if the\r\nDuke of Argyll's interpretation is correct. I write, however, not so\r\nmuch to reply to your argument as to correct a misapprehension which my\r\nexpressions seem to have given you. The objections are not made by\r\nTyndall or Huxley; but they are objections made by me, which I stated to\r\nthem, and in which they agreed--Tyndall expressing the opinion that I\r\nought to make them public. I name this because you may otherwise some\r\nday startle Tyndall or Huxley by speaking to them of _their_ objections,\r\nand giving me as the authority for so affiliating them.--Very truly\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR C. LYELL TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_73 Harley Street, London, W. November, 1867._\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,--You probably remember an article by Agassiz in an\r\nAmerican periodical, the _Christian Observer_, on the diversity of human\r\nraces, etc., to prove that each distinct race was originally created for\r\neach zoological and botanical province. But while he makes out a good\r\ncase for the circumscription of the principal races to distinct\r\nprovinces, he evades in a singular manner the community of the Red\r\nIndian race to North and South America. He takes pains to show that the\r\nsame American race pervades North and South America, or at least all\r\nAmerica south of the Arctic region. This was Dr. Morton's opinion, and\r\nis, I suppose, not to be gainsaid. In other words, while the Papuan,\r\nIndo-Malayan, Negro and other races are strictly limited each of them to\r\na particular region of mammalia, the Red Indian type is common to\r\nSclater's Neo-arctic and Neo-tropical regions. Have you ever considered\r\nthe explanation of this fact on Darwinian principles? If there were not\r\nbarbarous tribes like the Fuegians, one might imagine America to have\r\nbeen peopled when mankind was somewhat more advanced and more capable of\r\ndiffusing itself over an entire continent. But I cannot well understand\r\nwhy isolation such as accompanies a very low state of social progress\r\ndid not cause the Neo-tropical and Neo-arctic regions to produce by\r\nvarieties and Natural Selection two very different human races. May it\r\nbe owing to the smaller lapse of time, which time, nevertheless, was\r\nsufficient to allow of the spread of the representatives of one and the\r\nsame type from Canada to Cape Horn? Have you ever touched on this\r\nsubject, or can you refer me to anyone who has?--Believe me ever most\r\ntruly yours,\r\n\r\nCHA.

LYELL\r\n\r\n\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nDear Sir Charles,--Why the colour of man is sometimes constant over\r\nlarge areas while in other cases it varies, we cannot certainly tell;\r\nbut we may well suppose it to be due to its being more or less\r\ncorrelated with constitutional characters favourable to life. By far the\r\nmost common colour of man is a warm brown, not very different from that\r\nof the American Indian. White and black are alike deviations from this,\r\nand are probably correlated with mental and physical peculiarities which\r\nhave been favourable to the increase and maintenance of the particular\r\nrace. I shall infer, therefore, that the brown or red was the original\r\ncolour of man, and that it maintains itself throughout all climates in\r\nAmerica because accidental deviations from it have not been accompanied\r\nby any useful constitutional peculiarities. It is Bates's opinion that\r\nthe Indians are recent immigrants into the tropical plains of South\r\nAmerica, and are not yet fully acclimatised.--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R.

May 5, 1869._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--I am reading--or rather have all but read--your new\r\nbook,[10] with a delight which I cannot find words to express save those\r\nwhich are commonplace superlatives. Let me felicitate you on having, at\r\nlast, added to the knowledge of our planet a chapter which has not its\r\nequal (as far as I can recollect) since our friend Darwin's \"Voyage of\r\nthe _Beagle_.\" Let me, too, compliment you on the modesty and generosity\r\nwhich you have shown, in dedicating your book to Darwin, and speaking of\r\nhim and his work as you have done. Would that a like unselfish chivalry\r\nwere more common--I do not say amongst scientific men, for they have it\r\nin great abundance, but--in the rest of the community.\r\n\r\nMay I ask--as a very great favour--to be allowed to call on you some day\r\nin London, and to see your insects? I and my daughter are soon, I hope,\r\ngoing to the West Indies, for plants and insects, among other things;\r\nand the young lady might learn much of typical forms from one glance at\r\nyour treasures.\r\n\r\nI send this letter by our friend Bates--being ignorant of your\r\naddress.--Believe me, my dear Sir, ever yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nC.

February 2, 1871._\r\n\r\nDear Miss Buckley,--I have read Darwin's first volume,[12] and like it\r\nvery much. It is overwhelming as proving the origin of man from some\r\nlower form, but that, I rather think, hardly anyone doubts now.\r\n\r\nHe is very weak, as yet, on my objection about the \"hair,\" but promises\r\na better solution in the second volume.\r\n\r\nHave you seen Mivart's book, \"Genesis of Species\"? It is exceedingly\r\nclever, and well worth reading. The arguments against Natural Selection\r\nas the exclusive mode of development are some of them exceedingly\r\nstrong, and very well put, and it is altogether a most readable and\r\ninteresting book.\r\n\r\nThough he uses some weak and bad arguments, and underrates the power of\r\nNatural Selection, yet I think I agree with his conclusion in the main,\r\nand am inclined to think it is more philosophical than my own. It is a\r\nbook that I think will please Sir Charles Lyell.--Believe me, yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MISS A.

I admire his Moral Sense chapter as much as anything in the\r\nbook. It is both original and the most satisfactory of all the\r\ntheories, if not quite satisfactory....--Believe me yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Darwin's book on the whole is wonderful! There are plenty of\r\npoints open to criticism, but it is a marvellous contribution to the\r\nhistory of the development of the forms of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR C.

I do not believe there is a word which Darwin would wish altered.\r\nIt is high time this modest assertion of your claims as an independent\r\noriginator of Natural Selection should be published.--Ever most truly,\r\n\r\nCHA.

August 2, 1880._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I think you have made an immense advance to our\r\nknowledge of the ways and means of distribution, and bridged many great\r\ngaps.[14] Your reasoning seems to me to be sound throughout, though I am\r\nnot prepared to receive it in all its details.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to regard the Western Australian flora as the latest in\r\npoint of origin, and I hope to prove it by development, and by the\r\nabsence of various types. If Western Australia ever had an old flora, I\r\nam inclined to suppose that it has been destroyed by the invasion of\r\nEastern types after the union with East Australia. My idea is that these\r\ntypes worked round by the south, and altered rapidly as they proceeded\r\nwestward, increasing in species. Nor can I conceive the Western Island,\r\nwhen surrounded by sea, harbouring a flora like its present one.\r\n\r\nI have been disposed to regard New Caledonia and the New Hebrides as the\r\nparent country of many New Zealand and Australian forms of vegetation,\r\nbut we do not know enough of the vegetation of the former to warrant the\r\nconclusion; and after all it would be but a slight modification of your\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nI very much like your whole working of the problem of the isolation and\r\nconnection of New Zealand and Australia _inter se_ and with the\r\ncountries north of them, and the whole treatment of that respecting\r\nnorth and south migration over the globe is admirable....--Ever most\r\ntruly yours,\r\n\r\nJ.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR J. HOOKER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Royal Gardens, Kew. November 10, 1880._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--I have been waiting to thank you for \"Island Life\"\r\ntill I should have read it through as carefully as I am digesting the\r\nchapters I have finished; but I can delay no longer, if only to say that\r\nI heartily enjoy it, and believe that you have brushed away more cobwebs\r\nthat have obscured the subject than any other, besides giving a vast\r\ndeal that is new, and admirably setting forth what is old, so as to\r\nthrow new light on the whole subject. It is, in short, a first-rate\r\nbook. I am making notes for you, but hitherto have seen no defect of\r\nimportance except in the matter of the Bahamas, whose flora is Floridan,\r\nnot Cuban, in so far as we know it....--Very truly yours,\r\n\r\nJOS. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO SIR W. THISELTON-DYER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pen-y-bryn, St. Peter's Road, Croydon. January 7, 1881._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Thiselton-Dyer,--If I had had your lecture before me when\r\nwriting the last chapters of my book I should certainly have quoted you\r\nin support of the view of the northern origin of the Southern flora by\r\nmigration along existing continents. On reading it again I am surprised\r\nto find how often you refer to this; but when I read it on its first\r\nappearance I did not pay special attention to this point except to note\r\nthat your views agreed more closely with those I had advanced, derived\r\nfrom the distribution of animals, than those of any previous writer on\r\nbotanical distribution. When, at a much later period, on coming to the\r\nend of my work, I determined to give a chapter to the New Zealand flora\r\nin order to see how far the geological and physical relations between\r\nNew Zealand and Australia would throw light on its origin, I went for my\r\nfacts to the works of Sir Joseph Hooker and Mr. Bentham, and also to\r\nyour article in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica,\" and worked out my\r\nconclusions solely from these, and from the few facts referring to the\r\nmigration of plants which I had collected. Had I referred again to your\r\nlecture I should certainly have quoted the cases you give (in a note, p.\r\n431) of plants extending along the Andes from California to Peru and\r\nChile, and vice versa. Whatever identity there is in our views was\r\ntherefore arrived at independently, and it was an oversight on my part\r\nnot referring to your views, partly due to your not having made them a\r\nmore prominent feature of your very interesting and instructive lecture.\r\nWorking as I do at home, I am obliged to get my facts from the few books\r\nI can get together; and I only attempted to deal with these great\r\nbotanical questions because the facts seemed sufficiently broad and\r\ndefinite not to be much affected by errors of detail or recent additions\r\nto our knowledge, and because the view which I took of the past changes\r\nin Australia and New Zealand seemed calculated to throw so much light\r\nupon them. Without such splendid summaries of the relations of the\r\nSouthern floras as are given in Sir J. Hooker's Introductions, I should\r\nnot have touched the subject at all; and I venture to hope that you or\r\nsome of your colleagues will give us other such summaries, brought down\r\nto the present date, of other important floras--as, for example, those\r\nof South Africa and South Temperate America.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for additional peculiar British plants. When I hear what Mr.\r\nMitten has to say about the mosses, etc., I should like to send a\r\ncorrected list to _Nature_, which I shall ask you to be so good as to\r\ngive a final look over.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Mr. Darwin strongly objects to my view of the migration of plants\r\nalong mountain-ranges, rather than along lowlands during cold periods.\r\nThis latter view seems to me as difficult and inadequate as mine does to\r\nhim.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWallace was in frequent correspondence with Professor Raphael Meldola,\r\nthe eminent chemist, a friend both of Darwin and of Wallace, a student\r\nof Evolution, and a stout defender of Darwinism. I received from him\r\nmuch help and advice in connection with this work, and had he lived\r\nuntil its completion--he died, suddenly, in 1914--my indebtedness to him\r\nwould have been even greater.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Meldola refers to a suggestion that the white\r\ncolour of the undersides of animals might have been developed by\r\nselection through the _physical_ advantage gained from the protection of\r\nthe vital parts by a _lighter_ colour and therefore by a surface of less\r\nradiative activity. The idea was that there would be less loss of animal\r\nheat through such a white coating. We were at that time unaware of\r\nThayer's demonstration of the value of such colouring for the purposes\r\nof concealment among environment. Wallace accepted Thayer's view at once\r\nwhen it was subsequently put forward; as do most naturalists at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nTO PROF. MELDOLA\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frith Hill, Godalming. April 8, 1885._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--Your letter in _Nature_ last week \"riz my dander,\" as\r\nthe Yankees say, and, for once in a way, we find ourselves deadly\r\nenemies prepared for mortal combat, armed with steel (pens) and prepared\r\nto shed any amount of our own--ink. Consequently I rushed into the fray\r\nwith a letter to _Nature_ intended to show that you are as wrong (as\r\nwicked) as are the Russians in Afghanistan. Having, however, the most\r\nperfect confidence that the battle will soon be over,... --Yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to the theory of physiological selection\r\nwhich had recently been propounded by Romanes, and which Prof. Meldola\r\nhad criticised in _Nature_, xxxix. 384.\r\n\r\nTO PROF. MELDOLA\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frith Hill, Godalming. August 28, 1886._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--I have just read your reply to Romanes in _Nature_,\r\nand so far as your view goes I agree, but it does not go far enough.\r\nProfessor Newton has called my attention to a passage in Belt's\r\n\"Nicaragua,\" pp. 207-8, in which he puts forth very clearly exactly your\r\nview. I find I had noted the explanation as insufficient, and I hear\r\nthat in Darwin's copy there is \"No! No!\" against it. It seems, however,\r\nto me to summarise _all_ that is of the slightest value in Romanes'\r\nwordy paper. I have asked Newton (to whom I had lent it) to forward to\r\nyou at Birmingham a proof of my paper in the _Fortnightly_, and I shall\r\nbe much obliged if you will read it carefully, and, if you can, \"hold a\r\nbrief\" for me at the British Association in this matter. You will see\r\nthat a considerable part of my paper is devoted to a demonstration of\r\nthe fallacy of that part of \"Romanes\" which declares species to be\r\ndistinguished generally by useless characters, and also that\r\n\"simultaneous variations\" do not usually occur.\r\n\r\nOn the question of sterility, which, as you well observe, is the core of\r\nthe question, I think I show that it could not work in the way Romanes\r\nputs it. The objection to Belt's and your view is, also, that it would\r\nnot work unless the \"sterility variation\" was correlated with the\r\n\"useful variation.\" You assume, I think, this correlation, when you\r\nspeak of two of your varieties, B. and K., being _less fertile with the\r\nparent form_. Without correlation they could not be so, only some few of\r\nthem. Romanes always speaks of his physiological variations as being\r\nindependent, \"primary,\" in which case, as I show, they could hardly ever\r\nsurvive. At the end of my paper I show a correlation which is probably\r\ngeneral and sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn criticising Romanes, however, at the British Association, I want to\r\ncall your special attention to a point I have hardly made clear enough\r\nin my paper. Romanes always speaks of the \"physiological variety\" as if\r\nit were like any other _simple_ variety, and could as easily (he says\r\nmore easily) be increased. Whereas it is really complex, requiring a\r\nremarkable correlation between different sets of individuals which he\r\nnever recognises. To illustrate what I mean, let me suppose a case. Let\r\nthere occur in a species three individual physiological varieties--A, B\r\nand C--each being infertile with the bulk of the species, but quite\r\nfertile with some small part of it. Let A, for example, be fertile with\r\nX, Y and Z. Now I maintain it to be in the highest degree improbable\r\nthat B, a quite distinct individual, with distinct parents originating\r\nin a distinct locality, and perhaps with a very different constitution,\r\nmerely because it also is sterile with the bulk of the species, should\r\nbe fertile with the very same individuals, X, Y, Z, that A is fertile\r\nwith. It seems to me to be at least 100 to 1 that it will be fertile\r\nwith some other quite distinct set of individuals. And so with C, and\r\nany other similar variety. I express this by saying that each has its\r\n\"sexual complements,\" and that the complements of the one are almost\r\nsure not to be the complements of the other. Hence it follows that A, B,\r\nC, though differing in the same character of general infertility with\r\nthe bulk of the species, will really be three distinct varieties\r\nphysiologically, and can in no way unite to form a single physiological\r\nvariety. This enormous difficulty Romanes apparently never sees, but\r\nargues as if all individuals that are infertile with the bulk of the\r\nspecies must be or usually are fertile with the same set of individuals\r\nor with each other. This I call a monstrous assumption, for which not a\r\nparticle of evidence exists. Take this in conjunction with my argument\r\nfrom the severity of the struggle for existence and the extreme\r\nimprobability of the respective \"sexual complements\" coming together at\r\nthe right time, and I think Romanes' ponderous paper is disposed of.\r\n\r\nI wrote my paper, however, quite as much to expose the great presumption\r\nand ignorance of Romanes in declaring that Natural Selection is _not_ a\r\ntheory of the origin of species--as it is calculated to do much harm.\r\nSee, for instance, the way the Duke of Argyll jumped at it like a trout\r\nat a fly!--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earlier part of the next letter refers to \"The Experimental Proof of\r\nthe Protective Value of Colour and Markings in Insects in reference to\r\ntheir Vertebrate Enemies,\" in the _Proceedings of the Zoological Society\r\nof London_, 1887, p. 191.\r\n\r\nTO PROF. POULTON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frith Hill, Godalming. October 20, 1887._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--It is very interesting to me to see how very generally\r\nthe facts are in accordance with theory, and I am only surprised that\r\nthe exceptions and irregularities are not more numerous than they are\r\nfound to be. The only difficult case, that of _D. euphorbiæ_, is due\r\nprobably to incomplete knowledge. Are lizards and sea-birds the only, or\r\neven the chief, possible enemies of the species? They evidently do not\r\nprevent its coming to maturity in considerable abundance, and it is\r\ntherefore no doubt preserved from its chief enemies during its various\r\nstages of growth.\r\n\r\nThe only point on which I differ from you--as you know--is your\r\nacceptance, as proved, of the theory of sexual colour selection, and\r\nyour speaking of insects as having a sense of \"the beautiful\" in colour,\r\nas if that were a known fact. But that is a wide question, requiring\r\nfull discussion.--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

I was not aware before that your father had been so\r\ndistressed--or rather disturbed--by my sending him my essay from\r\nTernate, and I am very glad to feel that his exaggerated sense of honour\r\nwas quite needless so far as I was concerned, and that the incident did\r\nnot in any way disturb our friendly relations. I always felt, and feel\r\nstill, that people generally give me far too much credit for my mere\r\nsketch of the theory--so very small an affair as compared with the vast\r\nfoundation of fact and experiment on which your father worked.--Believe\r\nme yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FISHER (_née_ BUCKLEY)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frith Hill, Godalming. February 16, 1888._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Fisher,--I know nothing of the physiology of ferns and\r\nmosses, but as a matter of fact I think they will be found to increase\r\nand diminish together all over the world. Both like moist, equable\r\nclimates and shade, and are therefore both so abundant in oceanic\r\nislands, and in the high regions of the tropics.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that the reason ferns have persisted so long in\r\ncompetition with flowering plants is the fact that they thrive best in\r\nshade, flowers best in the light. In our woods and ravines the flowers\r\nare mostly spring flowers, which die away just as the foliage of the\r\ntrees is coming out and the shade deepens; while ferns are often dormant\r\nat that time, but grow as the shade increases.\r\n\r\nWhy tree-ferns should not grow in cold countries I know not, except that\r\nit may be the winds are too violent and would tear all the fronds off\r\nbefore the spores were ripe. Everywhere they grow in ravines, or in\r\nforests where they are sheltered, even in the tropics. And they are not\r\ngenerally abundant, but grow in particular zones only. In all the Amazon\r\nvalley I don't remember ever having seen a tree-fern....\r\n\r\nI too am struggling with my \"Popular Sketch of Darwinism,\" and am just\r\nnow doing a chapter on the great \"hybridity\" question. I really think I\r\nshall be able to arrange the whole subject more intelligibly than Darwin\r\ndid, and simplify it immensely by leaving out the endless discussion of\r\ncollateral details and difficulties which in the \"Origin of Species\"\r\nconfuse the main issue....\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable steps yet made in advance are, I think, the theory\r\nof Weismann of the continuity of the germ plasm, and its corollary that\r\nacquired modifications are never inherited! and Patrick Geddes's\r\nexplanation of the laws of growth in plants on the theory of the\r\nantagonism of vegetative and reproductive growth....--Yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

March 20, 1888._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--I have been working away at my hybridity chapters,[15]\r\nand am almost disposed to cry \"Eureka!\" for I have got light on the\r\nproblem. When almost in despair of making it clear that Natural\r\nSelection could act one way or the other, I luckily routed out an old\r\npaper that I wrote twenty years ago, giving a demonstration of the\r\naction of Natural Selection. It did not convince Darwin then, but it has\r\nconvinced me now, and I think it can be proved that in some cases (and\r\nthose I think most probable) Natural Selection will accumulate\r\nvariations in infertility between incipient species. Many other causes\r\nof infertility co-operate, and I really think I have overcome the\r\nfundamental difficulties of the question and made it a good deal clearer\r\nthan Darwin left it.... I think also it completely smashes up\r\nRomanes.--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next letter relates to a question which Prof. Meldola raised as to\r\nwhether, in view of the extreme importance of \"divergence\" (in the\r\nDarwinian sense) for the separation and maintenance of specific types,\r\nit might not be possible that sterility, when of advantage as a check to\r\ncrossing, had in itself, as a physiological character, been brought\r\nabout by Natural Selection, just as extreme fecundity had been brought\r\nabout (by Natural Selection) in cases where such fecundity was of\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nTO PROF. MELDOLA\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frith Hill, Godalming. April 12, 1888._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--Many thanks for your criticism. It is a perfectly\r\nsound one as against my view being a _complete explanation_ of the\r\nphenomena, but that I do not claim. And I do not see any chance of the\r\nrequired facts being forthcoming for many years to come. Experiments in\r\nthe hybridisation of animals are so difficult and tedious that even\r\nDarwin never undertook any, and the only people who could and ought to\r\nhave done it--the Zoological Society--will not. There is one point,\r\nhowever, I think you have overlooked. You urge the improbability of the\r\nrequired infertility being correlated with the particular variations\r\nwhich characterised each incipient species. But the whole point of my\r\nargument is, that the physiological adjustments producing fertility are\r\nso delicate that they are disturbed by almost any variation or change of\r\nconditions--except in the case of domestic animals, which have been\r\ndomesticated because they are not subject to this disturbance. The whole\r\nfirst half of the chapter is to bring out this fact, which Darwin has\r\ndwelt upon, and it certainly does afford a foundation for the assumption\r\nthat usually, and in some considerable number of individuals, variation\r\nin nature, accompanied by somewhat changed conditions of life, is\r\naccompanied by, and probably correlated with, some amount of\r\ninfertility. No doubt this assumption wants proving, but in the meantime\r\nI am glad you think that, granting the assumption, I have shown that\r\nNatural Selection is able to accumulate sterility variations.\r\n\r\nThat is certainly a step in advance, and we cannot expect to do more\r\nthan take very short theoretical steps till we get more facts to rest\r\nupon. If you should happen to come across any facts which seem to bear\r\nupon it, pray let me know. I can find none but those I have referred to.\r\n\r\nI have just finished a chapter on male ornament and display, which I\r\ntrust will help to clear up that point--Believe me yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

August 26, 1888._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Hemsley,--You are aware that Patrick Geddes proposes to exclude\r\nNatural Selection in the origination of thorns and spines, which he\r\nimputes to \"diminishing vegetativeness\" or \"ebbing vitality of the\r\nspecies.\" It has occurred to me that insular floras should afford a test\r\nof the correctness of this view, since in the absence of mammalia the\r\nprotection of spines would be less needed.\r\n\r\nYour study of these floras will no doubt enable you to answer a few\r\nquestions on this point. Spines and thorns are, I believe, usually\r\nabundant in arid regions of continents, especially in South Africa,\r\nwhere large herbivorous mammals abound. Now, if the long-continued\r\npresence of these mammals is a factor in the production of spines by\r\nNatural Selection, they should be wholly or comparatively absent in\r\nregions equally arid where there are no mammals. The Galapagos seem to\r\nbe such a case--also perhaps some of the Sandwich Islands, and generally\r\nthe extra-tropical volcanic islands. Also Australia comparatively, and\r\nthe highlands of Madagascar.\r\n\r\nOf course, the endemic species must be chiefly considered, as they have\r\nhad time to be modified by the conditions. If you can give me the facts,\r\nor your general impression from your study of these floras, I shall be\r\nmuch obliged. I see, of course, many other objections to Geddes's\r\ntheory, but this seems to offer a crucial test.--Believe me yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

The facts\r\nyou state seem quite to support the usual view, that thorns and spines\r\nhave been developed as a protection against other animals. The few spiny\r\nplants in New Zealand may be for protection against land molluscs, of\r\nwhich there are several species as large as any in the tropics. Of\r\ncourse in Australia we should expect only a comparative scarcity of\r\nspines, as there are many herbivorous marsupials in the\r\ncountry.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

The paper on\r\n\"Heredity\" is intensely interesting, and I am waiting anxiously for the\r\nconcluding part.

The last critical one is rather heavy, and\r\nadds nothing of importance to the earlier one on Duration of Life. I\r\nenclose my \"Note\" on the subject, which was written, I think, about\r\n1867, certainly before 1870. You will see it was only a few ideas jotted\r\ndown for further elaboration and then forgotten. I see however it _does_\r\ncontain the germ of Weismann's argument as to duration of life being\r\ndetermined by the time of securing continuance of the species.--Yours\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R.

January 20, 1889._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Poulton,--My attention has been called by Mr. Herdman, in\r\nhis Inaugural Address to the Liverpool Biological Society, to Galton's\r\npaper on \"Heredity,\" which I read years ago but had forgotten. I have\r\njust read it again (in the _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_,\r\nVol. V., p. 329, Jan., 1876), and I find a remarkable anticipation of\r\nWeismann's theories which I think should be noticed in a preface to the\r\ntranslation of his book.[17] He argues that it is the undeveloped germs\r\nor gemmules of the fertilised ovum that form the sexual elements of the\r\noffspring, and thus heredity and atavism are explained. He also argues\r\nthat, as a corollary, \"acquired modifications are barely if at all\r\ninherited in the correct sense of the word.\" He shows the imperfection\r\nof the evidence on this point, and admits, just as Weismann does, the\r\nheredity of changes in the parent like alcoholism, which, by permeating\r\nthe whole tissues, may _directly_ affect the reproductive elements. In\r\nfact, all the main features of Weismann's views seem to be here\r\nanticipated, and I think he ought to have the credit of it.\r\n\r\nBeing no physiologist, his language is not technical, and for this\r\nreason, and the place of publication perhaps, his remarkable paper\r\nappears to have been overlooked by physiologists.\r\n\r\nI think you will find the paper very suggestive, even supplying some\r\npoints overlooked by Weismann.--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R.

Now Henslow, in his \"Floral Structures,\"[18] adopts the same\r\ntheory for all the wind-fertilised or self-fertilised flowers, and he\r\ntells me that he is _alone_ in the view. I believe the view is a true\r\none, and I want to give G. Allen the credit of first starting it, and\r\nwant to see how far he went. If you have or can get this work of his\r\nwith that paper, can you lend it me for a few days? I know not who to\r\nwrite to for it, as botanists of course ignore it, and G.

In my present state of health I dare not read, and fear I shall\r\nbe unable to profit by the accumulation of evidence you have brought\r\ntogether.

I think you will find a good deal in it\r\nto criticise, and it will be well for you to know what the leader of the\r\nNeo-Lamarckians regards as the foundation-stones of his theory. I\r\ngreatly enjoyed my visit to Oxford, and only regretted that I could not\r\nleave more time for personal talk with yourself, for I am so deplorably\r\nignorant of modern physiology that I am delighted to get intelligible\r\nexplanations of its bearings on the subjects that most interest me in\r\nscience. I quite see all its importance in investigations of the\r\nmechanism of colours, but there is so much still unknown that it will be\r\nvery hard to convince me that there is no other possible explanation of\r\nthe peacock's feather than the \"continued preference by the females\" for\r\nthe most beautiful males, in _this one point_, \"during a long line of\r\ndescent\"--as Darwin says!

WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_42 Rutland Gate, S.W. May 24, 1890._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--I send the paper with pleasure, and am glad that you\r\nwill read it, and I hope then see more clearly than the abstract could\r\nshow the grounds of my argument.\r\n\r\nThese finger-marks are most remarkable things. Of course I have made out\r\nmuch more about them since writing that memoir. Indeed I have another\r\npaper on them next Thursday at the Royal Society, but that only refers\r\nto ways of cataloguing them, either for criminal administration, or what\r\nI am more interested in, viz. racial and hereditary inquiry.\r\n\r\nWhat I have done in this way is not ready for publication, but I may\r\nmention (privately, please) that these persistent marks, which seem\r\nfully developed in the sixth month of foetal life, and appear under the\r\nreservations and in the evidence published in the memoir to be\r\npractically _quite_ unchanged during life, are _not_ correlated with\r\nany ordinary characteristic that I can discover. They are the same in\r\nthe lowest idiots as in ordinary persons. (I took the impressions of\r\nsome 80 of these, so idiotic that they mostly could not speak, or even\r\nstand, at the great Darenth Asylum, Dartford.) They are the same in\r\nclod-hoppers as in the upper classes, and _yet_ they are as hereditary\r\nas other qualities, I think. Their tendency to symmetrical distribution\r\non the two hands is _marked_, and symmetry _is_ a form of kinship. My\r\nargument is that sexual selection can have had nothing to do with the\r\npatterns, neither can any other form of selection due to vigour, wits,\r\nand so forth, because they are not correlated with them. They just go\r\ntheir own gait, uninfluenced by anything that we can find or reasonably\r\nbelieve in, of a _naturally selective influence_, in the plain meaning\r\nof the phrase.--Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANCIS GALTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THEO.

Your theory to account for the influence of a\r\nfirst male on progeny by a second seems very probable--and in fact if,\r\nas I suppose, spermatozoa often enter ova without producing complete\r\nfertilisation, it must be so. _That_ would be easily experimented on,\r\nwith fowls, dogs, etc., but I do not remember the fact having been\r\nobserved except with horses.

Prof. Meldola\r\nendeavoured to show that the difficulties raised by Spencer and\r\nsupported by Romanes had no real weight because the possibility of\r\nso-called \"co-adaptations\" being developed _successively_ in the order\r\nof evolution had not been reckoned with. There was no real divergence\r\nbetween Wallace and Prof. Meldola on this matter when they subsequently\r\ndiscussed it. The correspondence is in _Nature_, xliii. 557, and\r\nsubsequently. _See also_ \"Darwin and After Darwin,\" by Romanes, 1895,\r\nii. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PROF. MELDOLA\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset, April 25, 1891._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--You have now put your foot in it! Romanes _agrees_\r\nwith you! Henceforth he will claim you as a disciple, converted by his\r\narguments!\r\n\r\nThere was one admission in your letter I was very sorry to see, because\r\nit cannot be strictly true, and is besides open to much\r\nmisrepresentation. I mean the admission that Romanes pounces upon in his\r\nsecond paragraph. Of course, the number of individuals in a species\r\nbeing finite, the chance of four coincident variations occurring in any\r\none individual--each such variation being separately very common--cannot\r\nbe anything like \"infinity to one.\" Why, then, do you concede it most\r\nfully?--the result being that Romanes takes you to concede that it is\r\ninfinity to one against the coincident variations occurring in \"_any\r\nindividuals_.\" Surely, with the facts of coincident independent\r\nvariation we now possess, the occurrence of three, four, or five,\r\ncoincident variations cannot be otherwise than frequent. As a fact, more\r\nthan half the whole population of most species seems to vary to a\r\nperceptible and measurable, and therefore sufficient, amount in scores\r\nof ways. Take a species with a million pairs of individuals--half of\r\nthese vary sufficiently, either + or -, in the four acquired characters\r\nA, B, C, D: what will be the proportion of individuals that vary + in\r\nthese four characters according to the law of averages? Will it not be\r\nabout 1 in 64? If so it is ample--in many cases--for Natural Selection\r\nto work on, because in many cases less than 1/64 of offspring survives.\r\n\r\nOn Romanes' view of the impossibility of Natural Selection doing\r\nanything alone, because the required coincident variations do not occur,\r\nthe occurrence of a \"strong man\" or a racehorse that beats all others\r\neasily must be impossible, since in each of these cases there must be\r\nscores of coincident favourable variations.\r\n\r\nGiven sufficient variation, I believe divergent modification of a\r\nspecies in two lines could easily occur, even if free intercrossing\r\noccurred, because, the numbers varying being a large proportion of the\r\nwhole, the numbers which bred like with like would he sufficient to\r\ncarry on the two lines of divergence, those that intercrossed and\r\nproduced less perfectly adapted offspring being eliminated. Of course\r\nsome amount of segregate breeding does always occur, as Darwin always\r\nmaintained, but, as he also maintained, it is not absolutely essential\r\nto evolution. Romanes argues as if \"free intercrossing\" meant that none\r\nwould pair like with like! I hope you will have another slap at him, and\r\nwithdraw or explain that unlucky \"infinity to one,\" which is Romanes'\r\nsheet-anchor.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. POULTON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. June 16, 1892._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Poulton,--Many thanks for sending me Weismann's additional\r\nEssays,[20] which I look forward to reading with much pleasure. I have,\r\nhowever, read the first, and am much disappointed with it. It seems to\r\nme the _weakest and most inconclusive_ thing he has yet written. At p.\r\n17 he states his theory as to degeneration of eyes, and again, on p. 18,\r\nof anthers and filaments; but in both cases he fails to _prove_ it, and\r\napparently does not see that his panmixia, or \"cessation of selection,\"\r\ncannot possibly produce _continuous_ degeneration culminating in the\r\ntotal or almost total disappearance of an organ. Romanes and others have\r\npointed out this weakness in his theory, but he does not notice it, and\r\ngoes on calmly throughout the essay to _assume_ that mere panmixia must\r\ncause progressive degeneration to an unlimited extent; whereas all it\r\ncan do is to effect a reduction to the average of the total population\r\non which selection has been previously worked. He says \"individuals with\r\nweak eyes would not be eliminated,\" but omits to notice that individuals\r\nwith strong eyes would also \"not be eliminated,\" and as there is no\r\nreason alleged why variations in _all directions_ should not occur as\r\nbefore, the free intercrossing would tend to keep up a mean condition\r\nonly a little below that which was kept up by selection. It is clear\r\nthat some form of selection must always co-operate in degeneration, such\r\nas economy of growth, which he hardly notices except as a possible but\r\nnot a necessary factor, or actual injuriousness. It appears to me that\r\nwhat is wanted is to take a number of typical cases, and in each of them\r\nshow how Natural Selection comes in to carry on the degeneration begun\r\nby panmixia. Weismann's treatment of the subject is merely begging the\r\nquestion.--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. POULTON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. August 29, 1892._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Poulton,--As to panmixia you have quite misunderstood my\r\nposition. By the \"mean condition,\" I do not mean the \"mean\" during the\r\nwhole course of development of the organ, as you seem to take it. That\r\nwould indeed be absurd. I do mean the \"mean\" of the whole series of\r\nindividual variations now occurring, during a period sufficient to\r\ncontain all or almost all the variations to which the species is _now_\r\nsubject. Take, for instance, such a case as the wings of the swallow, on\r\nthe full development of which the life of the bird depends. Many\r\nindividuals no doubt perish for lack of wing-power, due to deficiency in\r\nsize or form of wing, or in the muscles which move it. The extreme\r\nlimits of variation would be seen probably if we examined every swallow\r\nthat had reached maturity during the last century. The average of all\r\nthose would perhaps be 5 or 10 per cent. below the average of those that\r\nsurvive to become the parents of the next generation in any year; and\r\nwhat I maintain is, that panmixia alone could not reduce a swallow's\r\nwings below this first average. Any further reduction must be due either\r\nto some form of selection or to \"economy of growth\"--which is also,\r\nfundamentally, a form of selection. So with the eyes of cave animals,\r\npanmixia could only cause an imperfection of vision equal to the average\r\nof those variations which occurred, say, during a century before the\r\nanimal entered the cave. It could only produce more effect than this if\r\nthe effects of disuse are hereditary--which is a non-Weismannian\r\ndoctrine. I think this is also the position that Romanes took.--Yours\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. J.W.

His\r\nobservations are inimitable--and his theories and suggestions, if not\r\nalways the best, at least show thought on what he has observed.\r\n\r\nI was most pleased with his demonstration as to the supposed instincts\r\nof young birds and lambs, showing clearly that the former at all events\r\nare not due to inherited experience, as Darwin thought. The whole book,\r\ntoo, is pervaded by such a true love of nature and such a perception of\r\nits marvels and mysteries as to be unique in my experience. The modern\r\nscientific morphologists seem so wholly occupied in tracing out the\r\nmechanism of organisms that they hardly seem to appreciate the\r\noverwhelming marvel of the powers of life, which result in such\r\ninfinitely varied structures and such strange habits and so-called\r\ninstincts. The older I grow the more marvellous seem to me the mere\r\nvariety of form and habit in plants and animals, and the unerring\r\ncertitude with which from a minute germ the whole complex organism is\r\nbuilt up, true to the type of its kind in all the infinitude of details!\r\nIt is this which gives such a charm to the watching of plants\r\ngrowing, and of kittens so rapidly developing their senses and\r\nhabitudes!...--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

He expresses his constant dread--one of the\r\ntroubles of his life--that his children would inherit his bad health.\r\nIt seems pretty clear, from what F. Darwin says in the new edition, that\r\nDarwin's constant nervous stomach irritation was caused by his five\r\nyears sea-sickness. It was thoroughly established before, and in the\r\nearly years of, his marriage, and, on his own theory his children ought\r\nall to have inherited it. Have they? You know perhaps better than I do,\r\nwhether any of the family show any symptoms of that particular form of\r\nillness--and if not it is a fine case!--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

June 10, 1893._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--As we had no time to \"discourse\" on Thursday, I will\r\nsay a few words on the individual adaptability question. We have to deal\r\nwith facts, and facts certainly show that, in many groups, there is a\r\ngreat amount of adaptable change produced in the individual by external\r\nconditions, and that that change is not inherited. I do not see that\r\nthis places Natural Selection in any subordinate position, because this\r\nindividual adaptability is evidently advantageous to many species, and\r\nmay itself have been produced or increased by Natural Selection. When a\r\nspecies is subject to great changes of conditions, either locally or at\r\nuncertain times, it may be a decided advantage to it to become\r\nindividually adapted to that change while retaining the power to revert\r\ninstantly to its original form when the normal conditions return. But\r\nwhenever the changed conditions are permanent, or are such that\r\nindividual adaptation cannot meet the requirements, then Natural\r\nSelection rapidly brings about a permanent adaptation which is\r\ninherited. In plants these two forms of adaptation are well marked and\r\neasily tested, and we shall soon have a large body of evidence upon it.\r\nIn the higher animals I imagine that individual adaptation is small in\r\namount, as indicated by the fact that even slight varieties often breed\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIn Lepidoptera we have the two forms of colour-adaptability clearly\r\nshown. Many species are, in all their stages, permanently adapted to\r\ntheir environment. Others have a certain power of individual adaptation,\r\nas of the pupæ to their surroundings. If this last adaptation were\r\nstrictly inherited it would be positively injurious, since the progeny\r\nwould thereby lose the power of individual adaptability, and thus we\r\nshould have light pupæ on dark surroundings, and vice versa. Each kind\r\nof adaptation has its own sphere, and it is essential that the one\r\nshould be non-inheritable, the other heritable. The whole thing seems to\r\nme quite harmonious and \"as it should be.\"\r\n\r\nThiselton-Dyer tells me that H. Spencer is dreadfully disturbed on the\r\nquestion. He fears that acquired characters may not be inherited, in\r\nwhich case the foundation of his whole philosophy is undermined!--Yours\r\nvery truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I am afraid you are partly responsible for that kindly meant but\r\ntoo personal manifestation which disturbed the solemnity of the Royal\r\nSociety meeting on Thursday!...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF.

It was about a\r\nwonderful and perfectly authenticated case of a woman who dressed the\r\narm of a gamekeeper after amputation, and six or seven months afterwards\r\nhad a child born without the forearm on the right side, exactly\r\ncorresponding in _form_ and _length_ of stump to that of the man.\r\nPhotographs of the man, and of the boy seven or eight years old, were\r\ntaken _by the physician of the hospital_ where the man's arm was cut\r\noff, and they show a most striking correspondence.

November 17, 1893._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--The letter I wrote to you at Nottingham was returned\r\nto me here (after a month), so I did not think it worth while to send it\r\nto you again, though it did contain my congratulations on your\r\nappointment,[22] which I now repeat. As you have not seen the paper I\r\nsent to the British Association, I will just say that I should not have\r\nnoticed the subject publicly but, after a friend had given me the\r\nphotographs (sent with my paper), I came across the following statement\r\nin the new edition of Chambers' Encyclopædia, art. Deformities (by Prof.\r\nA. Hare): \"In an increasing proportion of cases which are carefully\r\ninvestigated, it appears that maternal impressions, the result of shock\r\nor unpleasant experiences, may have a considerable influence in\r\nproducing deformities in the offspring.\" In consequence of this I sent\r\nthe case which had been furnished me, and which is certainly about as\r\nwell attested and conclusive as anything can be. The facts are these:\r\n\r\nA gamekeeper had his right forearm amputated at the North Devon\r\nInfirmary. He left before it was healed, thinking his wife could dress\r\nit, but as she was too nervous, a neighbour, a young recently married\r\nwoman, a farmer's wife, still living, came and dressed it every day till\r\nit healed. About six months after she had a child born _without right\r\nhand and forearm_, the stump exactly corresponding in length to that of\r\nthe gamekeeper. Dr. Richard Budd, M.D., F.R.C.P.,[23] of Barnstaple, the\r\nphysician to the infirmary, when the boy was five or six years old,\r\nhimself took a photograph of the boy and the gamekeeper side by side,\r\nshowing the wonderful correspondence of the two arms. I have these facts\r\n_direct from Dr. Budd_, who was personally cognisant of the whole\r\ncircumstances. A few years after, in November, 1876, Dr. Budd gave an\r\naccount of the case and exhibited the photographs to a large meeting at\r\nthe College of Physicians, and I have no doubt it is _one_ of the cases\r\nreferred to in the article I have quoted, though Dr. Budd thinks it has\r\nnever been published. It will be at once admitted that this is not a\r\nchance coincidence, and that all theoretical difficulties must give way\r\nto such facts as this,  ... Of course it by no means follows that similar\r\ncauses should in all cases produce similar effects, since the\r\nidiosyncrasy of the mother is no doubt an important factor; but where\r\nthe combined coincidences are so numerous as in this case--_place, time,\r\nperson_ and exact correspondence of _resulting deformity_--some causal\r\nrelation must exist.--Believe me yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

His\r\nnonsensical representation of the theory ought to be exposed, for it\r\nwill mislead very many people. I see it is adopted by the _Pall Mall_. I\r\nhave been myself strongly prompted to take the matter up, but it is\r\nevidently your business to do that. Pray write a letter to the _Times_\r\nexplaining that selection or survival of the fittest does not\r\nnecessarily take place in the way he describes. You might set out by\r\nremarking that whereas he begins by comparing himself to a volunteer\r\ncolonel reviewing a regiment of regulars, he very quickly changes his\r\nattitude and becomes a colonel of regulars reviewing volunteers and\r\nmaking fun of their bunglings. He deserves a-severe castigation. There\r\nare other points on which his views should be rectified, but this is the\r\nessential point.\r\n\r\nIt behoves you of all men to take up the gauntlet he has thrown\r\ndown.--Very truly yours,\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER TO A.R.

Various articles in the papers show that Lord Salisbury's\r\nargument is received with triumph, and, unless it is disposed of, it\r\nwill lead to a public reaction against the doctrine of evolution at\r\nlarge, a far more serious evil than any error which you propose to\r\nrectify among biologists. Everybody will look to you for a reply, and if\r\nyou make no reply it will be understood that Lord Salisbury's objection\r\nis valid. As to the non-publication of your letter in the _Times_, that\r\nis absurd, considering that your name and that of Darwin are constantly\r\ncoupled together.--Truly yours,\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF.

I was much pleased with your point of the adaptations\r\nsupposed to be produced by the inorganic environment when they are\r\nrelated to the organic. It is I think new and very forcible. For nearly\r\na month I have been wading through Bateson's book,[25] and writing a\r\ncriticism of it, and of Galton, who backs him up with his idea of\r\n\"organic stability.\"  ... Neither he nor Galton appears to have any\r\nadequate conception of what Natural Selection is, or how impossible it\r\nis to escape from it. They seem to think that, given a stable\r\nvariation, Natural Selection must hide its diminished head!\r\n\r\nBateson's preface, concluding reflections, etc., are often quite\r\namusing.... He is so cocksure he has made a great discovery--which is\r\nthe most palpable of mare's nests.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I allude of course to his grand argument--\"environment\r\n_continuous_--species _discontinuous_--therefore _variations_ which\r\nproduce species must be also _discontinuous_\"!

February 19, 1895._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--I have read your paper on \"Theories of Evolution\"[26]\r\nwith great pleasure. It is very clear and very forcible, and I should\r\nthink must have opened the eyes of some of your hearers. Your cases\r\nagainst Lamarckism were very strong, and I think quite conclusive. There\r\nis one, however, which seems to me weak--that about the claws of\r\nlobsters and the tails of lizards moving and acting when detached from\r\nthe body. It may be argued, fairly, that this is only an incidental\r\nresult of the extreme muscular irritability and contractibility of the\r\norgans, which might have been caused on Lamarckian as well as on the\r\nDarwinian hypothesis. The running of a fowl after its head is chopped\r\noff is an example of the same kind of thing, and this is certainly not\r\nuseful. The detachment itself of claw and tail is no doubt useful and\r\nadaptive.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing the objection as to failures not being found fossil,\r\nthere are two additional arguments to those you adduce: (1) Every\r\nfailure has been, first, a success, or it could not have come into\r\nexistence (as a species); and (2) the hosts of huge and very\r\nspecialised animals everywhere recently extinct are clearly failures.\r\nThey were successes as long as the struggle was with animal competitors\r\nonly, physical conditions being highly favourable. But, when physical\r\nconditions became adverse, as by drought, cold, etc., they failed and\r\nbecame extinct. The entrance of new enemies from another area might\r\nequally render them failures. As to your question about myself and\r\nDarwin, I had met him once only for a few minutes at the British Museum\r\nbefore I went to the East.... --Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R.

The article was in\r\nprint last September, but, being long, was crowded out month after\r\nmonth, and only now got in by being cut in two.

March 15, 1895._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--I have now nearly finished reading Romanes, but do not\r\nfind it very convincing. There is a large amount of special pleading. On\r\ntwo points only I feel myself hit. My doubt that Darwin really meant\r\nthat _all_ the individuals of a species could be similarly modified\r\nwithout selection is evidently wrong, as he adduces other quotations\r\nwhich I had overlooked. The other point is, that my suggested\r\nexplanation of sexual ornaments gives away my case as to the utility of\r\nall specific characters. It certainly does as it stands, but I now\r\nbelieve, and should have added, that all these ornaments, where they\r\ndiffer from species to species, are also recognition characters, and as\r\nsuch were rendered stable by Natural Selection from their first\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nI rather doubt the view you state, and which Gulick and Romanes make\r\nmuch of, that a portion of a species, separated from the main body, will\r\nhave a different average of characters, unless they are a local race\r\nwhich has already been somewhat selected. The large amount of variation,\r\nand the regularity of the curve of variation, whenever about 50 or 100\r\nindividuals are measured in the same locality, shows that the bulk of a\r\nspecies are similar in amount of variation everywhere. But when a\r\nportion of a species begins to be modified in adaptation to new\r\nconditions, distinction of some kind is essential, and therefore any\r\nslight difference would be increased by selection. I see no reason to\r\nbelieve that species (usually) have been isolated first and modified\r\nafterwards, but rather that new species usually arise from species which\r\nhave a wide range, and in different areas need somewhat different\r\ncharacters and habits. Then _distinctness_ arises both by adaptation and\r\nby development of recognition marks to minimise intercrossing.\r\n\r\nI wonder Darwin did not see that if the unknown \"constant causes\" he\r\nsupposes can modify all the individuals of a species, either\r\nindifferently, usefully, or hurtfully, and that these characters so\r\nproduced are, as Romanes says, very, very numerous in all species, and\r\nare sometimes the only specific characters, then the Neo-Lamarckians are\r\nquite right in putting Natural Selection as a very secondary and\r\nsubordinate influence, since all it has to do is to weed out the hurtful\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nOf course, if a species with warning colours were, in part, completely\r\nisolated, and its colours or markings were accidentally different from\r\nthe parent form, whatever set of markings and colours it had would be, I\r\nconsider, rendered stable for recognition, and also for protection,\r\nsince if it varied too much the young birds and other enemies would take\r\na heavier toll in learning it was uneatable. It might then be said that\r\nthe character by which this species differs from the parent species is a\r\nuseless character. But surely this is not what is usually meant by a\r\n\"useless character.\" This is highly useful in itself, though the\r\ndifference from the other species is not useful. If they were in contact\r\nit would be useful, as a distinction preventing intercrossing, and so\r\nlong as they are not brought together we cannot really tell if it is a\r\nspecies at all, since it might breed freely with the parent form and\r\nthus return back to one type. The \"useless characters\" I have always had\r\nin mind when arguing this question are those which are or are supposed\r\nto be absolutely useless, not merely relatively as regards the\r\ndifference from an allied species. I think this is an important\r\ndistinction.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_64 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, London, N.W. September 28, 1895_\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--As I cannot get you to deal with Lord Salisbury I\r\nhave decided to do it myself, having been finally exasperated into doing\r\nit by this honour paid to his address in France--the presentation of a\r\ntranslation to the French Academy. The impression produced upon some\r\nmillions of people in England cannot be allowed to be thus further\r\nconfirmed without protest.\r\n\r\nOne of the points which I propose to take up is the absurd conception\r\nLord Salisbury sets forth of the process of Natural Selection. When you\r\nwrote you said you had dealt with it yourself in your volume on\r\nDarwinism. I have no doubt that it is also in some measure dealt with by\r\nDarwin himself, by implication or incidentally. You of course know\r\nDarwin by heart, and perhaps you would be kind enough to save me the\r\ntrouble of searching by indicating the relevant passages both in his\r\nbooks and in your own. My reading power is very small, and it tries me\r\nto find the parts I want by much reading.--Truly yours,\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the following letter from Mr. Gladstone, Wallace attached this pencil\r\nnote: \"In 1881 I put forth the first idea of mouth-gesture as a factor\r\nin the origin of language, in a review of E.B. Tylor's 'Anthropology,'\r\nand in 1895 I extended it into an article in the _Fortnightly Review_,\r\nand reprinted it with a few further corrections in my 'Studies,' under\r\nthe title 'The Expressiveness of Speech or Mouth-Gesture as a Factor in\r\nthe Origin of Language.' In it I have developed a completely new\r\nprinciple in the theory of the origin of language by showing that every\r\nmotion of the jaws, lips and tongue, together with inward or outward\r\nbreathing, and especially the mute or liquid consonants ending words\r\nwhich serve to indicate abrupt or continuous motion, have corresponding\r\nmeanings in so many cases as to show a fundamental connection. I thus\r\nenormously extended the principle of onomatopoeia in the origin of vocal\r\nlanguage. As I have been unable to find any reference to this important\r\nfactor in the origin of language, and as no competent writer has pointed\r\nout any fallacy in it, I think I am justified in supposing it to be new\r\nand important. Mr. Gladstone informed me that there were many thousands\r\nof illustrations of my ideas in Homer.\"--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nW.E. GLADSTONE TO A.R.

You go upon a kindred class in _sn_. I do not remember a perfectly\r\n_innocent_ word, a word habitually used _in bonam partem_, and beginning\r\nwith _sn_, except the word \"snow,\" and \"snow,\" as I gather from\r\n_Schnee_, is one of the worn-down words.\r\n\r\nMay I beg to illustrate you once more on the ending in _p_. I take our\r\nold schoolboy combinations: hop, skip and jump. Each motion an ending\r\nmotion; and to each word closed with _p_ compare the words _run, rennen,\r\ncourir, currere._\r\n\r\nBut I have now a new title to speak. It is deafness; and I know from\r\ndeafness that I run a worse chance with a man whose mouth is covered\r\nwith beard and moustache.\r\n\r\nA young relation of mine, slightly deaf, was sorely put to it in an\r\nUniversity examination because one of his examiners was _secretal_ in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nI will not trouble you further except to express, with misgiving, a\r\ndoubt on a single point, the final _f_.\r\n\r\nIn driving with Lord Granville, who was deaf but not very deaf, I had\r\noccasion to mention to him the Duke of _Fife_, I used every effort, but\r\nin no way could I contrive to make him hear the word.\r\n\r\nI break my word to add one other particular. Out of 27,000 odd lines in\r\nHomer, every one of them expressed, in a sense, heavy weight or force;\r\nthe blows of heavy-armed men on the breastplates of foes  ...

I see you quote Spalding's\r\nexperiments, but these have been quite superseded and shown to be\r\nseriously incorrect by Prof. Lloyd Morgan. A paper by him in the\r\n_Fortnightly Review_ of August, 1893, gives an account of his\r\nexperiments, and he read a paper on the same subject at the British\r\nAssociation last year. He is now preparing a volume on the subject\r\nwhich will contain the most valuable series of observations yet made on\r\nthis question. Another point of some importance where I cannot agree\r\nwith you is your treating dipsomania as a disease, only to be eliminated\r\nby drunkenness and its effects. It appears to me to be only a vicious\r\nhabit or indulgence which would cease to exist in a state of society in\r\nwhich the habit were almost universally reprobated, and the means for\r\nits indulgence almost absent. But this is a matter of comparatively\r\nsmall importance.--Believe me yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO DR.

If we find--as I think we do--that all cases of supposed\r\n\"instinctive knowledge\" in the former turn out to be merely intuitive\r\nreactions to various kinds of stimulus, combined with very rapidly\r\nacquired experience, we shall be justified in thinking that the actions\r\nof the latter will some day be similarly explained.

October 12, 1896._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--I got Weismann's \"Germinal Selection\" two or three\r\nmonths back and read it very carefully, and on the whole I admire it\r\nvery much, and think it does complete the work of ordinary variation and\r\nselection. Of course it is a pure hypothesis, and can never perhaps be\r\ndirectly proved, but it seems to me a reasonable one, and it enables us\r\nto understand two groups of facts which I have never been able to work\r\nout satisfactorily by the old method. These two facts are: (1) the\r\ntotal, or almost total, disappearance of many useless organs, and (2)\r\nthe continuous development of secondary sexual characters beyond any\r\nconceivable utility, and, apparently, till checked by inutility. It\r\nexplains both these. Disuse alone, as I and many others have always\r\nargued, cannot do the first, but can only cause _regression to the\r\nmean_, with perhaps some further regression from economy of material.\r\n\r\nAs to the second, I have always felt the difficulty of accounting for\r\nthe enormous development of the peacock's train, the bird of paradise\r\nplumes, the long wattle of the bell bird, the enormous tail-feathers of\r\nthe Guatemalan trogon, of some humming-birds, etc. etc. etc. The\r\nbeginnings of all these I can explain as recognition marks, and this\r\nexplains also their distinctive character in allied species, but it does\r\nnot explain their growing on and on far beyond what is needful for\r\nrecognition, and apparently till limited by absolute hurtfulness. It is\r\na relief to me to have \"germinal selection\" to explain this.\r\n\r\nI do not, however, think it at all necessary to explain adaptations,\r\nhowever complex. Variation is so general and so large, in dominant\r\nspecies, and selection is so tremendously powerful, that I believe all\r\nneedful adaptation may be produced without it. But, if it exists, it\r\nwould undoubtedly hasten the process of such adaptation and would\r\ntherefore enable new places in the economy of nature to be more rapidly\r\nfilled up.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of writing a popular exposition of the new theory for\r\n_Nature_, but have not yet found time or inclination for it. I began\r\nreading \"Germinal Selection\" with a prejudice against it. That prejudice\r\ncontinued through the first half, but when I came to the idea itself,\r\nand after some trouble grasped the meaning and bearing of it, I saw the\r\nwork it would do and was a convert at once. It really has no relation to\r\nLamarckism, and leaves the non-heredity of acquired characters exactly\r\nwhere it was.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next letter relates to the great controversy then being carried on\r\nwith respect to Weismann's doctrine of the non-inheritance of \"acquired\"\r\ncharacters, which doctrine implied complete rejection of the last trace\r\nof Lamarckism from Darwinian evolution. Wallace ultimately accepted the\r\nWeismannian teaching. Darwin had no opportunity during his lifetime of\r\nconsidering this question, which was raised later in an acute form by\r\nWeismann.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PROF. MELDOLA\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstane, Dorset. January 6, 1897._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--The passage to which you refer in the \"Origin\" (top of\r\np. 6) shows Darwin's firm belief in the \"heredity of acquired\r\nvariations,\" and also in the importance of definite variations, that is,\r\n\"sports,\" though elsewhere he almost gives these up in favour of\r\nindefinite variations; and this last is now the view of all Darwinians,\r\nand even of many Lamarckians. I therefore always now assume this as\r\nadmitted. Weismann's view as to \"possible variations\" and \"impossible\r\nvariations\" on p. 1 of \"Germinal Selection\" is misleading, because it\r\ncan only refer to \"sports\" or to \"cumulative results,\" not to\r\n\"individual variations\" such as are the material Natural Selection acts\r\non. Variation, as I understand it, can only be a slight modification in\r\nthe offspring of that which exists in the parent. The question whether\r\npigs could possibly develop wings is absurd, and altogether beside the\r\nquestion, which is, solely, so far as direct evidence goes, as to the\r\nmeans by which the change from one species to another closely allied\r\nspecies has been brought about. Those who want to begin by discussing\r\nthe causes of change from a dog to a seal, or from a cow to a whale, are\r\nnot worth arguing with, as they evidently do not comprehend the A, B, C\r\nof the theory.\r\n\r\nDarwin's ineradicable acceptance of the theory of heredity of the\r\neffects of climate, use and disuse, food, etc., on the individual led to\r\nmuch obscurity and fallacy in his arguments, here and there.--Yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. POULTON _Parkstone, Dorset. February 14, 1897._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--Thanks for copy of your British Association\r\nAddress,[28] which I did not read in _Nature_, being very busy just\r\nthen. I have now read it with much pleasure, and think it a very useful\r\nand excellent discussion that was much needed. There is, however, one\r\nimportant error, I think, which vitiates a vital part of the argument,\r\nand which renders it possible so to reduce the time indicated by geology\r\nas to render the accordance of Geology and Physics more easy to effect.\r\nThe error I allude to was made by Sir A. Geikie in his Presidential\r\nAddress[29] which you quote. Immediately it appeared I wrote to him\r\npointing it out, but he merely acknowledged my letter, saying he would\r\nconsider it. To me it seems a most palpable and extraordinary blunder.\r\nThe error consists in taking the rate of deposition as the same as the\r\nrate of denudation, whereas it is about twenty times as great, perhaps\r\nmuch more--because the area of deposition is at least twenty times less\r\nthan that of denudation. In order to equal the area of denudation, it\r\nwould require that _every_ bed of _every_ formation should have once\r\nextended over the _whole area_ of all the land of the globe! The\r\ndeposition in narrow belts along coasts of all the matter brought down\r\nby rivers, as proved by the _Challenger_, leads to the same result. In\r\nmy \"Island Life,\" 2nd Edit., pp. 221-225, I have discussed this whole\r\nmatter, and on reading it again I can find no fallacy in it. I have,\r\nhowever, I believe, overestimated the time required for deposition,\r\nwhich I believe would be more nearly one-fortieth than one-twentieth\r\nthat of mean denudation; because there is, I believe, also a great\r\noverestimate of the maximum of deposition, because it is partly made up\r\nof beds which may have been deposited simultaneously. Also the maximum\r\nthickness is probably double the mean thickness.\r\n\r\nThe mean rate of denudation, both for European rivers and for all the\r\nrivers that have been measured, is a foot in three million years, which\r\nis the figure that should be taken in calculations.--Believe me yours\r\nvery truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

I thought Romanes' article in reply to Spencer\r\nwas very well written and wonderfully clear for him, and I agree with\r\nmost of it, except his high estimate of Spencer's co-adaptation\r\nargument. It is quite true that Spencer's biology rests entirely on\r\nLamarckism, so far as heredity of acquired characters goes. I have been\r\nreading Weismann's last book, \"The Germ Plasm.\" It is a wonderful\r\nattempt to solve the most complex of all problems, and is almost\r\nunreadable without some practical acquaintance with germs and their\r\ndevelopment.--Believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. POULTON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. June 13, 1897._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--  ... The rate of deposition might be modified in an\r\narchipelago, but would not necessarily be less than now, on the\r\n_average_. On the ocean side it might be slow, but wherever there were\r\ncomparatively narrow straits between the islands it might be even faster\r\nthan now, because the area of deposition would be strictly limited. In\r\nthe seas between Java and Borneo and between Borneo and Celebes the\r\ndeposition _may be_ above the average. Again, during the development of\r\ncontinents there were evidently extensive mountain ridges and masses\r\nwith landlocked seas, or inland lakes, and in all these deposition would\r\nbe rapid. Anyhow, the fact remains that there is no necessary equality\r\nbetween rates of denudation and deposition (in thickness) as Geikie has\r\n_assumed_.\r\n\r\nI was delighted with your account of Prichard's wonderful anticipation\r\nof Galton and Weismann! It is so perfect and complete.... It is most\r\nremarkable that such a complete statement of the theory and such a\r\nthorough appreciation of its effects and bearing should have been so\r\nlong overlooked. I read Prichard when I was very young, and have never\r\nseen the book since. His facts and arguments are really useful ones, and\r\nI should think Weismann must be delighted to have such a supporter come\r\nfrom the grave. His view as to the supposed transmission of disease is\r\nquite that of Archdall Reid's recent book. He was equally clear as to\r\nSelection, and had he been a _zoologist_ and _traveller_ he might have\r\nanticipated the work of both Darwin and Weismann!\r\n\r\nTo bring out such a book as his \"Researches\" when only twenty-seven, and\r\na practising physician, shows what a remarkable man he was.--Believe me\r\nyours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

I am now reading a wonderfully interesting\r\nbook--O. Fisher's \"Physics of the Earth's Crust.\" It is really a grand\r\nbook, and, though full of unintelligible mathematics, is so clearly\r\nexplained and so full of good reasoning on all the aspects of this most\r\ndifficult question that it is a pleasure to read it. It was especially a\r\npleasure to me because I had just been writing an article on the\r\nPermanence of the Oceanic Basins, at the request of the Editor of\r\n_Natural Science_, who told me I was not orthodox on the point. But I\r\nfind that Fisher supports the same view with very great force, and it\r\nstrikes me that if weight of argument and number of capable supporters\r\ncreate orthodoxy in science, it is the other side who are not orthodox.\r\nI have some fresh arguments, and I was delighted to be able to quote\r\nFisher. It seems almost demonstrated now that Sir W. Thomson was wrong,\r\nand that the earth _has_ a molten interior and a very thin crust, and in\r\nno other way can the phenomena of geology be explained....--Yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

March 8, 1898._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--My own opinion has long been--and I have many times given\r\nreasons for it--that there is always an ample amount of variation in all\r\ndirections to allow any useful modification to be produced, very\r\nrapidly, as compared with the rate of those secular changes (climate and\r\ngeography) which necessitate adaptation; hence no guidance of variation\r\nin certain lines is necessary. For proof of this I would ask you to look\r\nat the diagrams in Chapter III. of my \"Darwinism,\" reading the\r\nexplanation in the text. The proof of such constant indefinite\r\nvariability has been much increased of late years, and if you consider\r\nthat instead of tens or hundreds of individuals, Nature has as many\r\nthousands or millions to be selected from, every year or two, it will be\r\nclear that the materials for adaptation are ample.\r\n\r\nAgain, I believe that the time, even as limited by Lord Kelvin's\r\ncalculations, is ample, for reasons given in Chapter X., \"On the Earth's\r\nAge,\" in my \"Island Life,\" and summed up on p. 236. I therefore consider\r\nthe difficulty set forth on p. 2 of the leaflet you send is not a real\r\none. To my mind, the development of plants and animals from low forms of\r\neach is fully explained by the variability proved to exist, with the\r\nactual rapid multiplication and Natural Selection. For this no other\r\nintellectual agency is required. The problem is to account for the\r\ninfinitely complex constitution of the material world and its forces\r\nwhich rendered living organisms possible; then, the introduction of\r\nconsciousness or sensation, which alone rendered the animal world\r\npossible; lastly, the presence in man of capacities and moral ideas and\r\naspirations which could not conceivably be produced by variation and\r\nNatural Selection. This is stated at p. 473-8 of my \"Darwinism,\" and is\r\nalso referred to in the article I enclose (at p. 443) and which you need\r\nnot return.\r\n\r\nThe subject is so large and complex that it is not to be wondered so\r\nmany people still maintain the insufficiency of Natural Selection,\r\nwithout having really mastered the facts. I could not, therefore, answer\r\nyour question without going into some detail and giving references....\r\n--Believe me yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. H.N. RIDLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. October 3, 1898._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Ridley,--  ... We are much interested now about De Rougemont,\r\nand I dare say you have seen his story in the _Wide World Magazine_,\r\nwhile in the _Daily Chronicle_ there have been letters, interviews and\r\ndiscussions without end. A few people, who think they know everything,\r\ntreat him as an impostor; but unfortunately they themselves contradict\r\neach other, and so far are proved to be wrong more often than De\r\nRougemont. I firmly believe that his story is substantially true--making\r\nallowance for his being a foreigner who learnt one system of measures,\r\nthen lived thirty years among savages, and afterwards had to reproduce\r\nall his knowledge in English and Australian idioms. As an intelligent\r\nwriter in the _Saturday Review_ says, putting aside the sensational\r\nillustrations there is absolutely nothing in his story but what is quite\r\n_possible_ and even _probable_. He must have reached Singapore the year\r\nafter I returned home, and I dare say there are people there who\r\nremember Jensen, the owner of the schooner _Veilland_, with whom he\r\nsailed on his disastrous pearl-fishing expedition. Jensen is said now to\r\nbe in British New Guinea, and has often spoken of his lost cargo of\r\npearls. ---- and ----, of the Royal Geographical Society, state that\r\nthey are convinced of the substantial truth of the main outlines of his\r\nstory, and after three interviews and innumerable questions are\r\nsatisfied of his _bona fides_--and so am I.--With best wishes, believe\r\nme to be yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

February 19, 1901._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I trust you will forgive a stranger troubling you with a\r\nletter, but a friend has asked me whether, as a matter of fact, Darwin\r\nheld that _all_ living creatures descended from one and the same\r\nancestor, and that the pedigree of a humming-bird and that of a\r\nhippopotamus would meet if traced far enough back. Can you tell me\r\nwhether Darwin did teach this?\r\n\r\nI should have thought that as life was developed once, it probably could\r\nand would be developed many times in different places, as month after\r\nmonth, and year after year went by; and that, from the very first, it\r\nprobably took many different forms and characters, in the same way as\r\ncrystals take different forms and shapes, even when composed of the same\r\nsubstance. From these many developments of \"life\" would descend as many\r\nseparate lines of evolution, one ending in the humming-bird, another in\r\nthe hippopotamus, a third in the kangaroo, etc., and their pedigrees\r\n(however far back they might be traced) would not join until they\r\nreached some primitive form of protoplasm,--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL WADDINGTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. SAMUEL WADDINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. February 23, 1901._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Darwin believed that all living things originated from \"a few\r\nforms or from one\"--as stated in the last sentence of his \"Origin of\r\nSpecies.\" But privately I am sure he believed in the _one_ origin. Of\r\ncourse there is a possibility that there were several distinct origins\r\nfrom inorganic matter, but that is very improbable, because in that case\r\nwe should expect to find some difference in the earliest forms of the\r\ngerms of life. But there is no such difference, the primitive germ-cells\r\nof man, fish or oyster being almost indistinguishable, formed of\r\nidentical matter and going through identical primitive changes.\r\n\r\nAs to the humming-bird and hippopotamus, there is no doubt whatever of a\r\ncommon origin--if evolution is accepted at all; since both are\r\nvertebrates--a very high type of organism whose ancestral forms can be\r\ntraced back to a simple type much earlier than the common origin of\r\nmammals, birds and reptiles.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO SIR FRANCIS DARWIN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. July 3, 1901._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Darwin,--Thanks for the letter returned. I _do_ hold the\r\nopinion expressed in the last sentence of the article you refer to, and\r\nhave reprinted it in my volume of Studies, etc. But the stress must be\r\nlaid on the word _proof_. I intended it to enforce the somewhat similar\r\nopinion of your father, in the \"Origin\" (p. 424, 6th Edit.), where he\r\nsays, \"Analogy may be a deceitful guide.\" But I really do not go so far\r\nas he did. For he maintained that there was not any proof that the\r\nseveral great classes or kingdoms were descended from common ancestors.\r\n\r\nI maintain, on the contrary, that all without exception are now proved\r\nto have originated by \"descent with modification,\" but that there is no\r\nproof, and no necessity, that the very same causes which have been\r\nsufficient to produce all the species of a genus or Order were those\r\nwhich initiated and developed the greater differences. At the same time\r\nI do _not_ say they were not sufficient. I merely urge that there is a\r\ndifference between proof and probability.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

You have,\r\nI think, produced a splendid and unanswerable set of facts proving the\r\nnon-heredity of acquired characters. I was particularly pleased with the\r\nportion on \"instincts,\" in which the argument is especially clear and\r\nstrong. I am afraid, however, the whole subject is above and beyond the\r\naverage \"entomologist\" or insect collector, but it will be of great\r\nvalue to all students of evolution. It is curious how few even of the\r\nmore acute minds take the trouble to reason out carefully the teaching\r\nof certain facts--as in the case of Romanes and the \"variable\r\nprotection,\" and as I showed also in the case of Mivart (and also\r\nRomanes and Gulick) declaring that isolation alone, without Natural\r\nSelection, could produce perfect and well-defined species (see _Nature_,\r\nJan. 12, 1899).... --Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R.

October 29, 1905._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Darwin,--I return you the two articles on \"Mutation\" with many\r\nthanks. As they are both supporters of de Vries, I suppose they put his\r\ncase as strongly as possible. Professor Hubrecht's paper is by far the\r\nclearest and the best written, and he says distinctly that de Vries\r\nclaims that all new species have been produced by mutations, and none by\r\n\"fluctuating variations.\" Professor Hubrecht supports this and says that\r\nde Vries has proved it! And all this founded upon a few \"sports\" from\r\none species of plant, itself of doubtful origin (variety or hybrid), and\r\noffering phenomena in no way different from scores of other cultivated\r\nplants. Never, I should think, has such a vast hypothetical structure\r\nbeen erected on so flimsy a basis!\r\n\r\nThe boldness of his statements is amazing, as when he declares (as if it\r\nwere a fact of observation) that fluctuating variability, though he\r\nadmits it as the origin of all domestic animals and plants, yet \"never\r\nleads to the formation of species\"! (Hubrecht, p. 216.) There is one\r\npoint where he so grossly misinterprets your father that I think you or\r\nsome other botanist should point it out. De Vries is said to quote from\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" II., p. 83, where Darwin refers to \"chance\r\nvariations\"--explained three lines on as \"the slight differences\r\nselected by which a race or species is at length formed.\" Yet de Vries\r\nand Hubrecht claim that by \"chance variations\" Darwin meant \"sports\" or\r\n\"mutations,\" and therefore agrees with de Vries, while both omit to\r\nrefer to the many passages in which, later, he gave less and less weight\r\nto what he termed \"single large variations\"--the same as de Vries'\r\n\"mutations\"!--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO SIR JOSEPH HOOKER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Wimborne. November 10, 1905._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir Joseph,--I am writing to apologise for a great oversight.\r\nWhen I sent my publishers a list of persons who had contributed to \"My\r\nLife\" in various ways, your name, which should have been _first_, was\r\nstrangely omitted, and the omission was only recalled to me yesterday by\r\nreading your letters to Bates in Clodd's edition of his Amazon book,\r\nwhich I have just purchased. I now send you a copy by parcel-post, in\r\nthe hope that you will excuse the omission to send it sooner.\r\n\r\nNow for a more interesting subject, I was extremely pleased and even\r\ngreatly surprised, in reading your letters to Bates, to find that at\r\nthat early period (1862) you were already strongly convinced of three\r\nfacts which are absolutely essential to a comprehension of the method of\r\norganic evolution, but which many writers, even now, almost wholly\r\nignore. They are (1) the universality and large amount of normal\r\nvariability, (2) the extreme rigour of Natural Selection, and (3) that\r\nthere is no adequate evidence for, and very much against, the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters.\r\n\r\nIt was only some years later, when I began to write on the subject and\r\nhad to think out the exact mode of action of Natural Selection, that I\r\nmyself arrived at (1) and (2), and have ever since dwelt upon them--in\r\nseason and out of season, as many will think--as being absolutely\r\nessential to a comprehension of organic evolution. The third I did not\r\nrealise till I read Weismann, I have never seen the sufficiency of\r\nnormal variability for the modification of species more strongly or\r\nbetter put than in your letters to Bates. Darwin himself never realised\r\nit, and consequently played into the hands of the \"discontinuous\r\nvariation\" and \"mutation\" men, by so continually saying \"_if_ they\r\nvary\"--\"without variation Natural Selection can do nothing,\" etc.\r\n\r\nYour argument that variations are not caused by change of environment is\r\nequally forcible and convincing. Has anybody answered de Vries yet?\r\n\r\nF. Darwin lent me Prof. Hubrecht's review from the _Popular Science\r\nMonthly_, in which he claims that de Vries has proved that new species\r\nhave always been produced from \"mutations,\" never through normal\r\nvariability, and that Darwin latterly agreed with him! This is to me\r\namazing! The Americans too accept de Vries as a second Darwin!--Yours\r\nvery sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED E. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR J. HOOKER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Camp, Sunningdale. November 12, 1905._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--My return from a short holiday at Sidmouth last\r\nThursday was greeted by your kind and welcome letter and copy of your\r\n\"Life.\" The latter was, I assure you, never expected, knowing as I do\r\nthe demand for free copies that such a work inflicts on the writer. In\r\nfact I had put it down as one of the annual Christmas gifts of books\r\nthat I receive from my own family. Coming, as it thus did, quite\r\nunexpectedly, it is doubly welcome, and I do heartily thank you for this\r\nproof of your greatly valued friendship. It will prove to be one of four\r\nworks of greatest interest to me of any published since Darwin's\r\n\"Origin,\" the others being Waddell's \"Lhasa,\" Scott's \"Antarctic\r\nVoyage,\" and Mill's \"Siege of the South Pole.\"\r\n\r\nI have not seen Clodd's edition of Bates's \"Amazon,\" which I have put\r\ndown as to be got, and I had no idea that I should have appeared in it.\r\nYour citation of my letters and their contents are like dreams to me;\r\nbut to tell you the truth, I am getting dull of memory as well as of\r\nhearing, and what is worse, in reading: what goes in at one eye goes out\r\nat the other. So I am getting to realise Darwin's consolation of old\r\nage, that it absolves me from being expected to know, remember, or\r\nreason upon new facts and discoveries. And this must apply to your query\r\nas to anyone having as yet answered de Vries. I cannot remember having\r\nseen any answer; only criticisms of a discontinuous sort. I cannot for a\r\nmoment entertain the idea that Darwin ever assented to the proposition\r\nthat new species have always been produced from mutation and never\r\nthrough normal variability. Possibly there is some quibble on the\r\ndefinition of mutation or of variation. The Americans are prone to\r\nbelieve any new things, witness their swallowing the thornless cactus\r\nproduced by that man in California--I forget his name--which Kew exposed\r\nby asking for specimens to exhibit in the Cactus House....--I am, my\r\ndear Wallace, sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nJOS.

A book[32] has been sent me, however, which is a masterpiece of\r\nclearness and sound reasoning on such difficult questions, and is a far\r\nmore crushing reply to Haeckel than O. Lodge's. I therefore send you a\r\ncopy, and feel sure you will enjoy it. It is a stiff piece of reasoning,\r\nand wants close attention and careful thought, but I think you will be\r\nable to appreciate it. In my opinion it comes as near to an intelligible\r\nsolution of these great problems of the Universe as we are likely to\r\nget while on earth. It is a book to read and think over, and read again.\r\nIt is a masterpiece....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF.

I am glad to\r\nhear you have a new book on \"Evolution\"[33] nearly ready and that in it\r\nyou will do something to expose the fallacies of the Mutationists and\r\nMendelians, who pose before the world as having got _all_ wisdom, before\r\nwhich we poor Darwinians must hide our diminished heads!\r\n\r\nWishing to know the best that could be said for these latter-day\r\nanti-Darwinians, I have just been reading Lock's book on \"Variation,\r\nHeredity, and Evolution.\" In the early part of his book he gives a\r\ntolerably fair account of Natural Selection, etc. But he gradually turns\r\nto Mendelism as the \"one thing needful\"--stating that there can be \"no\r\nsort of doubt\" that Mendel's paper is the \"most important\" contribution\r\nof its size ever made to biological science!\r\n\r\n\"Mutation,\" as a theory, is absolutely nothing new--only the assertion\r\nthat new species originate _always_ in sports, for which the evidence\r\nadduced is the most meagre and inconclusive of any ever set forth with\r\nsuch pretentious claims! I hope you will thoroughly expose this absurd\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nMendelism is something new, and within its very limited range,\r\nimportant, as leading to conceptions as to the causes and laws of\r\nheredity, but only misleading when adduced as the true origin of species\r\nin nature, as to which it seems to me to have no part.--Yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

The\r\nwhole reads very clearly, and I am delighted with the way you expose the\r\nMendelian and Mutational absurd claims. That ought to really open the\r\neyes of the newspaper men to the fact that Natural Selection and\r\nDarwinism are not only holding their ground but are becoming more firmly\r\nestablished than ever by every fresh research into the ways and workings\r\nof living nature. I shall look forward to great pleasure in reading the\r\nwhole book. I was greatly pleased with Archdall Reid's view of Mendelism\r\nin _Nature_.[35] He is a very clear and original thinker.\r\n\r\nI see in Essay X. you use in the title the term \"defensive coloration.\"\r\nWhy this instead of the usual \"protective\"? Surely the whole function of\r\nsuch colours and markings is to protect from attack--not to defend when\r\nattacked. The latter is the function of stings, spines and hard coats. I\r\nonly mention this because using different terms may lead to some\r\nmisconception.\r\n\r\nYour illustration of mutation by throwing colours on a screen, and the\r\nargument founded on it, I liked much. That reminds me that H. Spencer's\r\nargument for inheritance of acquired variations--that co-ordination of\r\nmany parts at once, required for adaptations, would be impossible by\r\nchance variations of those parts--applies with a hundredfold force to\r\nmutations, which are admittedly so much less frequent both in their\r\nnumbers and the repetitions of them.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

That illuminates the whole\r\nproblem of heredity, combined with individual diversity, in a way\r\nnothing else does. I almost wish you could introduce that!--Yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

Rice Holmes's fine work on \"Ancient Britain and the Invasions of\r\nJulius Cæsar,\" that the author has arrived by purely historical study at\r\nthe conclusion that we have not risen morally above our primitive\r\nancestors. It is a curious and important coincidence.\r\n\r\nI myself got the germ of the idea many years ago, from a very acute\r\nthinker, Mr. Albert Mott, who gave some very original and thoughtful\r\naddresses as President of the Liverpool Philosophical Society, one of\r\nwhich dealt with the question of savages being often, perhaps always,\r\nthe descendants of more civilised races, and therefore affording no\r\nproof of progression. At that time (about 1860-70) I could not accept\r\nthe view, but I have now come to think he was right.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. POULTON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. November 2, 1908._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--  ... You may perhaps have heard that I have been\r\ninvited by the Royal Institution (through Sir W. Crookes) to give them a\r\nlecture on the jubilee of the \"Origin of Species\" in January, After some\r\nconsideration I accepted, because I _think_ I can give a broad and\r\ngeneral view of Darwinism, that will finally squash up the Mutationists\r\nand Mendelians, and be both generally intelligible and interesting. So\r\nfar as I know this has never yet been done, and the Royal Institution\r\naudience is just the intelligent and non-specialist one I shall be glad\r\nto give it to if I can.\r\n\r\nI have been very poorly the last three weeks, but am now recovering my\r\nhealth and strength slowly. It will take me all my time the next two\r\nmonths to get this ready, and now I must write a letter in reply to the\r\nabsurd and gross misrepresentation of Prof. Hubrecht, as to\r\nimaginary differences between Darwin and myself, in the last\r\n_Contemporary_!--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next letter relates to Wallace's Friday evening Discourse at the\r\nRoyal Institution. His friends were afraid whether his voice could be\r\nsustained throughout the hour--fears which were abundantly dispelled by\r\nthe actual performance. This was his last public lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PROF. MELDOLA\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. December 20, 1908._\r\n\r\nMy dear Meldola,--Thanks for your kind offer to read for me if\r\nnecessary. But when Sir Wm. Crookes first wrote to me about it, he\r\noffered to read all, or any parts of the lecture, if my voice did not\r\nhold out. I am very much afraid I cannot stand the strain of speaking\r\nbeyond my natural tone for an hour, or even for half that time--but I\r\nmay be able to do the opening and conclusion....\r\n\r\nI am glad that you see, as I do, the utter futility of the claims of the\r\nMutationists. I may just mention them in the lecture, but I hope I have\r\nput the subject in such a way that even \"the meanest capacity\" will\r\nsuffice to see the absurdity of their claims.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. POULTON\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. January 26, 1909._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--I had a delightful two hours at the Museum on Saturday\r\nmorning, as Mr. Rothschild brought from Tring several of his\r\nglass-bottomed drawers with his finest new New Guinea butterflies. They\r\n_were_ a treat! I never saw anything more lovely and interesting!...\r\n\r\nAs to your very kind and pressing invitation,[36] I am sorry to be\r\nobliged to decline it. I cannot remain more than one day or night away\r\nfrom home, without considerable discomfort, and all the attractions of\r\nyour celebration are, to me, repulsions....\r\n\r\nMy lecture, even as it will be published in the _Fortnightly_, will be\r\nfar too short for exposition of all the points I wish to discuss, and I\r\nhope to occupy myself during this year in saying all I want to say in a\r\nbook (of a wider scope) which is already arranged for. One of the great\r\npoints, which I just touched on in the lecture, is to show that all that\r\nis usually considered the waste of Nature--the enormous number produced\r\nin proportion to the few that survive--was absolutely essential in order\r\nto secure the variety and continuity of life through all the ages, and\r\nespecially of that one line of descent which culminated in man. That, I\r\nthink, is a subject no one has yet dealt with.--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. POULTON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. March 1, 1909._\r\n\r\nDear Poulton,--  ... I am glad that Lankester has replied to the almost\r\ndisgraceful Centenary article in the _Times_. But it is an illustration\r\nof the widespread mischief the Mutationists, etc., are doing. I have no\r\ndoubt, however, it will all come right in the end, though the end may be\r\nfar off, and in the meantime we must simply go on, and show, at every\r\nopportunity, that Darwinism actually does explain the whole fields of\r\nphenomena that they do not even attempt to deal with, or even\r\napproach....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. March 6, 1909._\r\n\r\nDear Mrs. Fisher,--  ... Another point I am becoming more and more\r\nimpressed with is, a teleology of fundamental laws and forces rendering\r\ndevelopment of the infinity of life-forms possible (and certain) in\r\nplace of the old teleology applied to the production of each species.\r\nSuch are the case of feathers reproduced annually, which I gave at end\r\nof lecture, and the still more marvellous fact of the caterpillar, often\r\nin two or three weeks of chrysalis life, having its whole internal,\r\nmuscular, nervous, locomotive and alimentary organs decomposed and\r\nrecomposed into a totally different being--an absolute miracle if ever\r\nthere is one, quite as wonderful as would be the production of a complex\r\nmarine organism out of a mass of protoplasm. Yet, because there has\r\nbeen continuity, the difficulty is slurred over or thought to be\r\nexplained!--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO SIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. June 22, 1909._\r\n\r\nDear Sir William,--On Saturday, to my great pleasure, I received a copy\r\nof the Darwin Commemoration volume. I at once began reading your most\r\nexcellent paper on the Geographical Distribution of Plants. It is\r\nintensely interesting to me, both because it so clearly brings out\r\nDarwin's views and so judiciously expounds his arguments--even when you\r\nintimate a difference of opinion--but especially because you bring out\r\nso clearly and strongly his views on the general permanence of\r\ncontinents and oceans, which to-day, as much as ever, wants insisting\r\nupon. I may just mention here that none of the people who still insist\r\non former continents where now are deep oceans have ever dealt with the\r\nalmost physical impossibility of such a change having occurred without\r\nbreaking the continuity of terrestrial life, owing to the mean depth of\r\nthe ocean being at least six times the mean height of the land, and its\r\narea nearly three times, so that the whole mass of the land of the\r\nexisting continents would be required to build up even _one small_\r\ncontinent in the depths of the Atlantic or Pacific! I have demonstrated\r\nthis, with a diagram, in my \"Darwinism\" (Chap, XII.), and it has never\r\nbeen either refuted or noticed, but passed by as if it did not exist!\r\nYour whole discussion of Dispersal and Distribution is also admirable,\r\nand I was much interested with your quotations from Guppy, whose book I\r\nhave not seen, but must read.\r\n\r\nMost valuable to me also are your numerous references to Darwin's\r\nletters, so that the article serves as a compendious index to the five\r\nvolumes, as regards this subject.\r\n\r\nEspecially admirable is the way in which you have always kept Darwin\r\nbefore us as the centre of the whole discussion, while at the same time\r\nfairly stating the sometimes adverse views of those who differ from him\r\non certain points....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ferns, Witcombe, Gloucester. June 25, 1909._\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Wallace,--It is difficult for me to tell you how gratified I am\r\nby your extraordinarily kind letter.... The truth is that success was\r\neasy. It has been my immense good fortune to know most of those who\r\nplayed in the drama. The story simply wanted a straightforward\r\namanuensis to tell itself. But it is a real pleasure to me to know that\r\nI have met with some measure of success.\r\n\r\nThere are many essays in the book that you will not like any more than I\r\ndo. The secret of this lies in the fact, which you pointed out in your\r\nmemorable speech at the Linnean Celebration, that no one but a\r\nnaturalist can really understand Darwin.\r\n\r\nI did not go to Cambridge--I had my hands full here. I was not sorry for\r\nthe excuse. There seemed to me a note of insincerity about the whole\r\nbusiness. I am short-tempered. I cannot stand being told that the origin\r\nof species has still to be discovered, and that specific differences\r\nhave no \"reality\" (Bateson's Essay, p. 89). People are of course at\r\nliberty to hold such opinions, but decency might have presented another\r\noccasion for ventilating them.--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nW.T. THISELTON-DYER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ferns, Witcombe, Gloucester. July 11, 1909._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--  ... I have just got F. Darwin's \"Foundations.\" He\r\ntries to make out that his father could have dispensed with Malthus. But\r\nthe selection death-rate in a slightly varying large population is _the_\r\npith of the whole business. The Darwin-Wallace theory is, as you say,\r\n\"the continuous adjustment of the organic to the inorganic world.\" It is\r\nwhat mathematicians call \"a moving equilibrium.\" In fact, I have always\r\nmaintained that it is a mathematical conception.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me there was a touch of insincerity about the whole\r\ncelebration,[37] as the younger Cambridge School as a whole do not even\r\nbegin to understand the theory.... I take it that the reason is, as you\r\npointed out, that none of them are naturalists.--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nW.T. THISELTON-DYER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO DR. ARCHDALL REID\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. December 28, 1909._\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Archdall Reid,--Many thanks for your very interesting and\r\ncomplimentary letter. I am very glad to hear of your new book, which I\r\ndoubt not will be very interesting and instructive. The subjects you\r\ntreat are, however, so very complex, and require so much accurate\r\nknowledge of the facts, and so much sound reasoning upon them, that I\r\ncannot possibly undertake the labour and thought required before I\r\nshould feel justified in expressing an opinion upon your treatment of\r\nthem....\r\n\r\nI rejoice to hear that you have exposed the fallacy of the claims of the\r\nMendelians. I have also tried to do so, but I find it quite impossible\r\nfor me to follow their detailed studies and arguments. It wants a\r\nmathematical mind, which I have not.\r\n\r\nBut on the general relation of Mendelism to Evolution I have come to a\r\nvery definite conclusion. This is, that it has no relation whatever to\r\nthe evolution of species or higher groups, but is really antagonistic to\r\nsuch evolution! The essential basis of evolution, involving as it does\r\nthe most minute and all-pervading adaptation to the whole environment,\r\nis extreme and ever-present plasticity, as a condition of survival and\r\nadaptation. But the essence of Mendelian characters is their rigidity.\r\nThey are transmitted without variation, and therefore, except by the\r\nrarest of accidents, can never become adapted to ever-varying\r\nconditions. Moreover, when crossed they reproduce the same pair of types\r\nin the same proportions as at first, and therefore without selection;\r\nthey are antagonistic to evolution by continually reproducing injurious\r\nor useless characters--which is the reason they are so rarely found in\r\nnature, but are mostly artificial breeds or sports. My view is,\r\ntherefore, that Mendelian characters are of the nature of abnormalities\r\nor monstrosities, and that the \"Mendelian laws\" serve the purpose of\r\neliminating them when, as usually, they are not useful, and thus\r\npreventing them from interfering with the normal process of natural\r\nselection and adaptation of the more plastic races. I am also glad to\r\nhear of your new argument for non-inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO SIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne, February 8, 1911._\r\n\r\nDear Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer,--I thank you very much for taking so much\r\ntrouble as you have done in writing your views of my new book.[38] I am\r\nglad to find that you agree with much of what I have said in the more\r\nevolutionary part of it, and that you differ only on some of my\r\nsuggested interpretations of the facts. I have always felt the\r\ndisadvantage I have been under--more especially during the last twenty\r\nyears--in having not a single good biologist anywhere near me, with whom\r\nI could discuss matters of theory or obtain information as to matters of\r\nfact. I am therefore the more pleased that you do not seem to have come\r\nacross any serious misstatements in the botanical portions, as to which\r\nI have had to trust entirely to second-hand information, often obtained\r\nthrough a long and varied correspondence.\r\n\r\nAs to your disagreement from me in the conclusions arrived at and\r\nstrenuously advocated in the latter portions of my work, I am not\r\nsurprised. I am afraid, now, that I have not expressed myself\r\nsufficiently clearly as to the fundamental phenomena which seem to me\r\nabsolutely to necessitate a guiding mind and organising power. Hardly\r\none of my critics (I think absolutely not one) has noticed the\r\ndistinction I have tried and intended to draw between Evolution on the\r\none hand, and the fundamental powers and properties of Life--growth,\r\nassimilation, reproduction, heredity, etc.--on the other. In Evolution I\r\nrecognise the action of Natural Selection as universal and capable of\r\nexplaining all the facts of the continuous development of species from\r\nspecies, \"from amoeba to man.\" But this, as Darwin, Weismann, Kerner,\r\nLloyd-Morgan, and even Huxley have seen, has nothing whatever to do with\r\nthe basic mysteries of life--growth, etc. etc. The chemists think they\r\nhave done wonders when they have produced in their laboratories certain\r\norganic substances--always by the use of other organic products--which\r\nlife builds up within each organism, and from the few simple elements\r\navailable in air, earth, and water, innumerable structures--bone, horn,\r\nhair, skin, blood, muscle, etc. etc.; and these are not amorphous--mere\r\nlumps of dead matter--but organised to serve certain definite purposes\r\nin each living organism. I have dwelt on this in my chapter on \"The\r\nMystery of the Cell.\" Now I have been unable to find any attempt by any\r\nbiologist or physiologist to grapple with this problem. One and all,\r\nthey shirk it, or simply state it to be insoluble. It is here that I\r\nstate guidance and organising power are essential. My little\r\nphysiological parable or allegory (p. 296) I think sets forth the\r\ndifficulty fairly, though by no means adequately, yet not one of about\r\nfifty reviews I have read even mentions it.\r\n\r\nIf you know of any writer of sufficient knowledge and mental power, who\r\nhas fully recognised and fairly grappled with this fundamental problem,\r\nI should be very glad to be referred to him. I have been able to find no\r\napproach to it. Yet I am at once howled at, or sneered at, for pointing\r\nout the facts that such problems exist, that they are not in any way\r\ntouched by Evolution, but are far before it, and the forces, laws and\r\nagencies involved are those of existences possessed of powers, mental\r\nand physical, far beyond those mere mechanical, physical, or chemical\r\nforces we see at work in nature....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ferns, Witcombe, Gloucester. February 12, 1911._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--  ... You must let me correct you on one technical\r\npoint in your letter. It is no longer possible to say that chemists\r\neffect the synthesis of organic products \"by the use of other organic\r\nsubstances.\" From what has been already effected, it cannot be doubted\r\nthat eventually every organic substance will be built up from \"the few\r\nsimple elements available in air, earth and water.\" I think you may take\r\nit from me that this does not admit of dispute....\r\n\r\nAt any rate we are in agreement as to Natural Selection being capable of\r\nexplaining evolution \"from amoeba to man.\"\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that that is a mechanical or scientific\r\nexplanation. That is to say, it invokes nothing but intelligible actions\r\nand causes.\r\n\r\nDe Vries, however, asserts that the Darwinian theory is _not_ scientific\r\nat all, and that is of course a position he has a right to take up.\r\n\r\nBut if we admit that it is scientific, then we are precluded from\r\nadmitting a \"directive power.\"\r\n\r\nThis was von Baer's position, also that of Kant and of Weismann.\r\n\r\nBut von Baer remarks that the naturalist is not precluded from asking\r\n\"whether the _totality_ of details leads him to a general and final\r\nbasis of intentional design.\" I have no objection to this, and offer it\r\nas an olive-branch which you can throw to your howling and sneering\r\ncritics.\r\n\r\nAs to \"structures organised to serve certain definite purposes,\" surely\r\nthey offer no more difficulty as regards \"scientific\" explanation than\r\nthe apparatus by which an orchid is fertilised.\r\n\r\nWe can work back to the amoeba to find ourselves face to face with a\r\nscarcely organised mass of protoplasm. And then we find ourselves face\r\nto face with a problem which will, perhaps, for ever remain insoluble\r\nscientifically. But as for that, so is the primeval material of which it\r\n(protoplasm) is composed. \"Matter\" itself is evaporating, for it is\r\nbeing resolved by physical research into something which is intangible.\r\n\r\nWe cannot form the slightest idea how protoplasm came into existence.\r\nIt is impossible to regard it as a mere substance. It is a mechanism.\r\nAlthough the chemist may hope to make eventually all the substances\r\nwhich protoplasm fabricates, and will probably do so, he can only build\r\nthem up by the most complicated processes. Protoplasm appears to be able\r\nto manufacture them straight off in a way of which the chemist cannot\r\nform the slightest conception. This is one aspect of the mystery of\r\n_life_. Herbert Spencer's definition tells one nothing.\r\n\r\nScience can only explain nature as it reveals itself to the senses in\r\nterms of consciousness. The explanation may be all wrong in the eyes of\r\nomniscience. All one can say is that it is a practical working basis,\r\nand is good enough for mundane purposes. But if I am asked if I can\r\nsolve the riddle of the Universe I can only answer, No. Brunetière then\r\nretorts that science is bankrupt. But this is equivocal. It only means\r\nthat it cannot meet demands beyond its power to satisfy.\r\n\r\nI entirely sympathise with anyone who seeks an answer from some other\r\nnon-scientific source. But I keep scientific explanations and spiritual\r\ncraving wholly distinct.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of evolution, as formulated by Lyell and Darwin, is to\r\nexplain phenomena by known causes. Now, directive power is not a known\r\ncause. Determinism compels me to believe that every event is inevitable.\r\nIf we admit a directive power, the order of nature becomes capricious\r\nand unintelligible. Excuse my saying all this. But that is the dilemma\r\nas it presents itself to _my_ mind. If it does not trouble other people,\r\nI can only say, so much the better for them. Briefly, I am afraid I must\r\nsay that it is ultra-scientific. I think that would have been pretty\r\nmuch Darwin's view.\r\n\r\nI do not think that it is quite fair to say that biologists shirk the\r\nproblem. In my opinion they are not called upon to face it. Bastian, I\r\nsuppose, believed that he had bridged the gulf between lifeless and\r\nliving matter. And here is a man, of whom I know nothing, who has\r\napparently got the whole thing cut and dried.--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nW.T.

May 28, 1912._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--Thanks for your paper on Darwin and Bergson.[39] I\r\nhave read nothing of Bergson's, and although he evidently has much in\r\ncommon with my own views, yet all vague ideas--like \"an internal\r\ndevelopment force\"--seem to me of no real value as an explanation of\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nI claim to have shown the necessity of an ever-present Mind as the\r\nprimal cause both of all physical and biological evolution. This Mind\r\nworks by and through the primal forces of nature--by means of Natural\r\nSelection in the world of life; and I do not think I could read a book\r\nwhich rejects this method in favour of a vague \"law of sympathy.\" He\r\nmight as well reject gravitation, electrical repulsion, etc. etc., as\r\nexplaining the motions of cosmical bodies....--Yours very truly, ALFRED\r\nR.

I have read it with much interest, as the\r\nwriter was evidently a man of thought and talent. The first lecture\r\ncertainly gives an approach to Darwin's theory, perhaps nearer than any\r\nother, as he almost implies the \"survival of the fittest\" as the cause\r\nof progressive modification. But his language is imaginative and\r\nobscure. He uses \"education\" apparently in the sense of what we should\r\nterm \"effect of the environment.\"\r\n\r\nThe second lecture is even a more exact anticipation of the modern views\r\nas to microbes, including their transmission by flies and other insects\r\nand the probability that the blood of healthy persons contains a\r\nsufficiency of destroyers of the pathogenic germs--such as the white\r\nblood-corpuscles--to preserve us in health.\r\n\r\nBut he is so anti-clerical and anti-Biblical that it is no wonder he\r\ncould not get a hearing in Boston in 1847.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

April 2, 1913._\r\n\r\nMy dear Poulton,--About two months ago an American  ... sent me the\r\nenclosed booklet,[41] which he had been told was very rare, and\r\ncontained an anticipation of Darwinism.\r\n\r\nThis it certainly does, but the writer was highly imaginative, and, like\r\nall the other anticipators of Darwin, did not perceive the whole scope\r\nof his idea, being, as he himself says, not sufficiently acquainted with\r\nthe facts of nature.\r\n\r\nHis anticipations, however, of diverging lines of descent from a common\r\nancestor, and of the transmission of disease germs by means of insects,\r\nare perfectly clear and very striking.\r\n\r\nAs you yourself made known one of the anticipators of Darwin, whom he\r\nhimself had overlooked, you are the right person to make this known in\r\nany way you think proper. As you have so recently been in America, you\r\nmight perhaps ascertain from the librarian of the public library in\r\nBoston, or from some of your biological friends there, what is known of\r\nthe writer and of his subsequent history.\r\n\r\nIf the house at Down is ever dedicated to Darwin's memory it would seem\r\nbest to preserve this little book there; if not you can dispose of it as\r\nyou think best.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

And for what? \"Agnostic\"\r\nis not in Shakespeare, but it may well have been used by someone before\r\nHuxley.

Mr. Marchant, the lecturer you\r\nheard, is a great friend of mine, but is now less dogmatic. The\r\nPiltdown skull does not prove much, if anything!\r\n\r\nThe papers are wrong about me. I am not writing anything now; perhaps\r\nshall write no more. Too many letters and home business. Too much\r\nbothered with many slight ailments, which altogether keep me busy\r\nattending to them. I am like Job, who said \"the grasshopper was a\r\nburthen\" to him! I suppose its creaking song.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.J. FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. 1913._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--  ... I presume your question \"Why?\" as to the varying colour\r\nof individual hairs and feathers, and the regular varying of adjacent\r\nhairs, etc., to form the surface pattern, applies to the ultimate cause\r\nwhich enables those patterns to be hereditary, and, in the case of\r\nbirds, to be reproduced after moulting yearly.\r\n\r\nThe purpose, or end they serve, I have, I think, sufficiently dealt with\r\nin my \"Darwinism\"; the method by which such useful tints and markings\r\nare produced, because useful, is, I think, clearly explained by the law\r\nof Natural Selection or Survival of the Fittest, acting through the\r\nuniversal facts of heredity and variation.\r\n\r\nBut the \"why\"--which goes further back, to the directing agency which\r\nnot only brings each special cell of the highly complex structure of a\r\nfeather into its exactly right position, but, further, carries pigments\r\nor produces surface striæ (in the case of the metallic or interference\r\ncolours) also to their exactly right place, and nowhere else--is the\r\nmystery, which, if we knew, we should (as Tennyson said of the flower in\r\nthe wall) \"know what God and Man is.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea that \"cells\" are all conscious beings and go to their right\r\nplaces has been put forward by Butler in his wonderful book \"Life and\r\nHabit,\" and now even Haeckel seems to adopt it. All theories of\r\nheredity, including Darwin's pangenesis, do not touch it, and it seems\r\nto me as fundamental as life and consciousness, and to be absolutely\r\ninconceivable by us till we know what life is, what spirit is, and what\r\nmatter is; and it is probable that we must develop in the spirit world\r\nsome few thousand million years before we get to this knowledge--if\r\nthen!\r\n\r\nMy book, \"Man's Place in the Universe,\" shows, I think, indications of\r\nthe vast importance of that Universe as the producer of Man which so\r\nmany scientific men to-day try to belittle, because of what may be, in\r\nthe infinite!--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nHome Life\r\n\r\n(By W.G. WALLACE and VIOLET WALLACE)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our father's youth and prime he was 6 ft. 1 in. in height, with\r\nsquare though not very broad shoulders. At the time to which our first\r\nclear recollections go back he had already acquired a slight stoop due\r\nto long hours spent at his desk, and this became more pronounced with\r\nadvancing age; but he was always tall, spare and very active, and walked\r\nwith a long easy swinging stride which he retained to the end of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAs a boy he does not appear to have been very athletic or muscularly\r\nstrong, and his shortsightedness probably prevented him from taking part\r\nin many of the pastimes of his schoolfellows. He was never a good\r\nswimmer, and he used to say that his long legs pulled him down. He was,\r\nhowever, always a good walker and, until quite late in life, capable of\r\ntaking long country walks, of which he was very fond.\r\n\r\nHe was very quick and active in his movements at times, and even when 90\r\nyears of age would get up on a chair or sofa to reach a book from a high\r\nshelf, and move about his study with rapid strides to find some paper to\r\nwhich he wished to refer.\r\n\r\nWhen out of doors he usually carried an umbrella, and in the garden a\r\nstick, upon which he leaned rather heavily in his later years. His hair\r\nbecame white rather early in life, but it remained thick and fine to the\r\nlast, a fact which he attributed to always wearing soft hats. He had\r\nfull beard and whiskers, which were also white. His eyes were blue and\r\nhis complexion rather pale. He habitually wore spectacles, and to us he\r\nnever looked quite natural without them. Towards the end of his life his\r\neyes were subject to inflammation, and the glasses were blue. His hands,\r\nthough large, were not clumsy, and were capable of very delicate\r\nmanipulation, as is shown by his skill in handling and preserving\r\ninsects and bird-skins, and also in sketching, where delicacy of touch\r\nwas essential. His handwriting is another example of this; it remained\r\nclear and even to the end, in spite of the fact that he wrote all his\r\nbooks, articles, and letters with his own hand until the last few years,\r\nwhen he occasionally had assistance with his correspondence; but his\r\nlast two books, \"Social Environment\" and \"The Revolt of Democracy,\"\r\nwritten when he was 90 years of age, were penned by himself, and the\r\nMSS. are perfectly legible and regular.\r\n\r\nHe was very domestic, and loved his home. His interest extended to the\r\nculinary art, and he was fond of telling us how certain things should be\r\ncooked. This became quite a joke among us. He was very independent, and\r\nit never seemed to occur to him to ask to have anything done for him if\r\nhe could do it himself--and he could do many things, such as sewing on\r\nbuttons and tapes and packing up parcels, with great neatness. When\r\nunpacking parcels he never cut the string if it could be untied, and he\r\nwould fold it up before removing the paper, which in its turn was also\r\nneatly folded.\r\n\r\nHis clothes were always loose and easy-fitting, and generally of some\r\nquiet-coloured cloth or tweed. Out of doors he wore a soft black felt\r\nhat rather taller than the clerical pattern, and a black overcoat unless\r\nthe weather was very warm. He wore no ornaments of any kind, and even\r\nthe silver watch-chain was worn so as to be invisible. He wore low\r\ncollars with turned-down points and a narrow black tie, which was,\r\nhowever, concealed by his beard. He was not very particular about his\r\npersonal appearance, except that he always kept his hair and beard well\r\nbrushed and trimmed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. A.R. WALLACE (about 1895)]\r\n\r\nIn our early days at Grays we children were allowed to run in and out of\r\nhis study; but if he was busy writing at the moment we would look at a\r\nbook until he could give us his attention. His brother in California\r\nsent him a live specimen of the lizard called the \"horned toad,\" and\r\nthis creature was kept in the study, where it was allowed to roam about,\r\nits favourite place being on the hearth.\r\n\r\nAbout this time he read \"Alice through the Looking-glass,\" which pleased\r\nhim greatly; he was never tired of quoting from it and using some of\r\nLewis Carroll's quaint words till it became one of our classics.\r\n\r\nSome of our earliest recollections are of the long and interesting walks\r\nwe took with our father and mother. He never failed to point out\r\nanything of interest and tell us what he knew about it, and would answer\r\nour numerous questions if possible, or put us off with some joking\r\nreference to Boojums or Jabberwocks. We looked upon him as an infallible\r\nsource of information, not only in our childhood, but to a large extent\r\nall his life. When exploring the country he scorned \"trespass boards.\"\r\nHe read them \"Trespassers will be persecuted,\" and then ignored them,\r\nmuch to our childish trepidation. If he was met by indignant gamekeepers\r\nor owners, they were often too much awed by his dignified and commanding\r\nappearance to offer any objection to his going where he wished. He was\r\nfond of calling our attention to insects and to other objects of natural\r\nhistory, and giving us interesting lessons about them. He delighted in\r\nnatural scenery, especially distant views, and our walks and excursions\r\nwere generally taken with some object, such as finding a bee-orchis or\r\na rare plant, or exploring a new part of the country, or finding a\r\nwaterfall.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 we went to live at Dorking, but stayed there only a year or two.\r\nAn instance of his love of mystifying us children may be given. It must\r\nhave been shortly after our arrival at Dorking that one day, having been\r\nout to explore the neighbourhood, he returned about tea-time and said,\r\n\"Where do you think I have been? To Glory!\" Of course we were very\r\nproperly excited, and plied him with questions, but we got nothing more\r\nout of him then. Later on we were taken to see the wonderful place\r\ncalled \"Glory Wood\"; and it had surely gained in glory by such\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nSometimes it would happen that a scene or object would recall an\r\nincident in his tropical wanderings and he would tell us of the sights\r\nhe had seen. At the time he was greatly interested in botany, in which\r\nhe was encouraged by our mother, who was an ardent lover of flowers; and\r\nto the end of his life he exhibited almost boyish delight when he\r\ndiscovered a rare plant. Many walks and excursions were taken for the\r\npurpose of seeing some uncommon plant growing in its natural habitat.\r\nWhen he had found the object of his search we were all called to see it.\r\nDuring his walks and holidays he made constant use of the one-inch\r\nOrdnance Maps, which he obtained for each district he visited, planning\r\nout our excursions on the map before starting. He had a gift for finding\r\nthe most beautiful walks by means of it.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 we moved to Croydon, where we lived about four years. It was at\r\nthis time that he hoped to get the post of Superintendent of Epping\r\nForest. We still remember all the delights we children were promised if\r\nwe went to live there. We had a day's excursion to see the Forest, he\r\nwith his map finding out the roads and stopping every now and then to\r\nadmire a fresh view or to explain what he would do if the opportunity\r\nwere given him. It was a very hot day, and we became so thirsty that\r\nwhen we reached a stream, to our great joy and delight he took out of\r\nhis pocket, not the old leather drinking-cup he usually carried, but a\r\nlong piece of black indiarubber tubing. We can see him now, quite as\r\npleased as we were with this brilliant idea, letting it down into the\r\nstream and then offering us a drink! No water ever tasted so nice! Our\r\nmother used to be a little anxious as to the quality of the water, but\r\nhe always put aside such objections by saying _running_ water was quite\r\nsafe, and somehow we never came to any harm through it. The same happy\r\nluck attended our cuts and scratches; he always put \"stamp-paper\" on\r\nthem, calling it plaster, and we knew of no other till years later. He\r\nused the same thing for his own cuts, etc., to the end of his life, with\r\nno ill effects.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 we moved again, this time to Godalming, where he had built a\r\nsmall house which be called \"Nutwood Cottage.\" After Croydon this was a\r\nvery welcome change and we all enjoyed the lovely country round. The\r\ngarden as usual was the chief hobby, and Mr. J.W. Sharpe, our old friend\r\nand neighbour in those days, has written his reminiscences of this time\r\nwhich give a very good picture of our father. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout thirty-five years ago Dr. Wallace built a house upon a plot of\r\nground adjoining that upon which our house stood. I was at that time an\r\nassistant master at Charterhouse School; and Dr. Wallace became\r\nacquainted with a few of the masters besides myself. With two or three\r\nof them he had regular weekly games of chess; for he was then and for\r\nlong afterwards very fond of that game; and, I understand, possessed\r\nconsiderable skill at it. A considerable portion of his spare time was\r\nspent in his garden, in the management of which Mrs. Wallace, who had\r\nmuch knowledge and experience of gardening, very cordially assisted him.\r\nHere his characteristic energy and restlessness were conspicuously\r\ndisplayed. He was always designing some new feature, some alteration in\r\na flower-bed, some special environment for a new plant; and always he\r\nwas confident that the new schemes would be found to have all the\r\nperfections which the old ones lacked. From all parts of the world\r\nbotanists and collectors sent him, from time to time, rare or newly\r\ndiscovered plants, bulbs, roots or seeds, which he, with the help of\r\nMrs. Wallace's practical skill, would try to acclimatise, and to\r\npersuade to grow somewhere or other in his garden or conservatory.\r\nNothing disturbed his cheerful confidence in the future, and nothing\r\nmade him happier than some plan for reforming the house, the garden, the\r\nkitchen-boiler, or the universe. And, truth to say, he displayed great\r\ningenuity in all these enterprises of reformation. Although they were\r\nnever in effect what they were expected to be by their ingenious author,\r\nthey were often sufficiently successful; but, successful or not, he was\r\nalways confident that the next would turn out to be all that he expected\r\nof it. With the same confidence he made up his mind upon many a\r\ndisputable subject; but, be it said, never without a laborious\r\nexamination of the necessary data, and the acquisition of much\r\nknowledge. In argument, of which intellectual exercise he was very fond,\r\nhe was a formidable antagonist. His power of handling masses of details\r\nand facts, of showing their inner meanings and the principles underlying\r\nthem, and of making them intelligible, was very great; and very few men\r\nof his time had it in equal measure.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking feature in his conversation was his masterly\r\napplication of general principles: these he handled with extraordinary\r\nskill. In any subject with which he was familiar, he would solve, or\r\nsuggest a plausible solution of, difficulty after difficulty by\r\nimmediate reference to fundamental principles. This would give to his\r\nconclusions an appearance of inevitableness which usually overbore his\r\nadversary, and, even if it did not convince him, left him without any\r\neffective reply. This, too, had a good deal to do, I am disposed to\r\nconjecture, with another very noticeable characteristic of his which\r\noften came out in conversation, and that was his apparently unfailing\r\nconfidence in the goodness of human nature. No man nor woman but he took\r\nto be in the main honest and truthful, and no amount of\r\ndisappointment--not even losses of money and property incurred through\r\nthis faith in others' virtues--had the effect of altering this mental\r\nhabit of his.\r\n\r\nHis intellectual interests were very widely extended, and he once\r\nconfessed to me that they were agreeably stimulated by novelty and\r\nopposition. An uphill fight in an unpopular cause, for preference a\r\nthoroughly unpopular one, or any argument in favour of a generally\r\ndespised thesis, had charms for him that he could not resist. In his\r\nlater years, especially, the prospect of writing a new book, great or\r\nsmall, upon any one of his favourite subjects always acted upon him like\r\na tonic, as much so as did the project of building a new house and\r\nlaying out a new garden. And in all this his sunny optimism and his\r\nunfailing confidence in his own powers went far towards securing him\r\nsuccess.--J.W.S.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Land Nationalisation\" (1882), \"Bad Times\" (1885), and \"Darwinism\"\r\n(1889) were written at Godalming, also the series of lectures which he\r\ngave in America in 1886-7 and at various towns in the British Isles. He\r\nalso continued to have examination papers[43] to correct each year--and\r\na very strenuous time that was. Our mother used to assist him in this\r\nwork, and also with the indexes of his books.\r\n\r\nWe now began to make nature collections, in which he took the keenest\r\ninterest, many holidays and excursions being arranged to further these\r\nengrossing pursuits. One or two incidents occurred at \"Nutwood\" which\r\nhave left clear impressions upon our minds. One day one of us brought\r\nhome a beetle, to the great horror of the servant. Passing at the\r\nmoment, he picked it up, saying, \"Why, it is quite a harmless little\r\ncreature!\" and to demonstrate its inoffensiveness he placed it on the\r\ntip of his nose, whereupon it immediately bit him and even drew blood,\r\nmuch to our amusment and his own astonishment. On another occasion he\r\nwas sitting with a book on the lawn under the oak tree when suddenly a\r\nlarge creature alighted upon his shoulder. Looking round, he saw a fine\r\nspecimen of the ring-tailed lemur, of whose existence in the\r\nneighbourhood he had no knowledge, though it belonged to some neighbours\r\nabout a quarter of a mile away. It seemed appropriate that the animal\r\nshould have selected for its attentions the one person in the district\r\nwho would not be alarmed at the sudden appearance of a strange animal\r\nupon his shoulder. Needless to say, it was quite friendly.\r\n\r\nA year or so before we left Godalming he enlarged the house and altered\r\nthe garden. But his health not having been very good, causing him a good\r\ndeal of trouble with his eyes, and having more or less exhausted the\r\npossibilities of the garden, he decided to leave Godalming and find a\r\nnew house in a milder climate. So in 1889 he finally fixed upon a small\r\nhouse at Parkstone in Dorset.\r\n\r\nPlanning and constructing houses, gardens, walls, paths, rockeries,\r\netc., were great hobbies of his, and he often spent hours making scale\r\ndrawings of some new house or of alterations to an existing one, and\r\nscheming out the details of construction. At other times he would devise\r\nschemes for new rockeries or waterworks, and he would always talk them\r\nover with us and tell us of some splendid new idea he had hit upon. As\r\nMr. Sharpe has noted, he was always very optimistic, and if a scheme did\r\nnot come up to his expectations he was not discouraged but always\r\ndeclared he could do it much better next time and overcome the defects.\r\nHe was generally in better health and happier when some constructional\r\nwork was in hand. He built three houses, \"The Dell\" at Grays, \"Nutwood\r\nCottage\" at Godalming, and the \"Old Orchard\" at Broadstone. The last he\r\nactually built himself, employing the men and buying all the materials,\r\nwith the assistance of a young clerk of works; but though the enterprise\r\nwas a source of great pleasure, it was a constant worry. He also\r\ndesigned and built a concrete garden wall, with which he was very\r\npleased, though it cost considerably more than he anticipated. He had\r\nnot been at Parkstone long before he set about the planning of\r\n\"alterations\" with his usual enthusiasm. We were both away from home at\r\nthis time, and consequently had many letters from him, of which one is\r\ngiven as a specimen. His various interests are nearly always referred to\r\nin these letters, and in not a few of them his high spirits show\r\nthemselves in bursts of exuberance which were very characteristic\r\nwhenever a new scheme was afoot. The springs of eternal youth were for\r\never bubbling up afresh, so that to us he never grew old. One of us\r\nremembers how, when he must have been about 80, someone said, \"What a\r\nwonderful old man your father is!\" This was quite a shock, for to us he\r\nwas not old. The letter referred to above is the following:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset, February 1, 1891._\r\n\r\nMy dear Will,--Another week has passed away into eternity, another month\r\nhas opened its eyes on the world, and still the illustrious Charles\r\n[bricklayer] potters about, still the carpenter plies the creaking saw\r\nand the stunning hammer, still the plumber plumbs and the bellhanger\r\nrattles, still the cisterns overflow and the unfinished drains send\r\nforth odorous fumes, still the rains descend and all around the house\r\nis a muddle of muck and mire, and still there is so much to do that we\r\nlook forward to some far distant futurity, when all that we are now\r\nsuffering will be over, and we may look back upon it as upon some\r\nstrange yet not altogether uninteresting nightmare!\r\n\r\nBriefly to report progress. The new pipe-man has finished the bathroom\r\nand nearly done the bells, and we have had gas alight the last three\r\ndays. The balcony is finished, the bath and lavatory are closed up and\r\nwaiting for the varnishers. Charles has finished the roof, and the\r\nscaffolding is removed. But though two plumbers have tried all their\r\nskill, the ball-cock in the cistern won't work, and when the water has\r\nbeen turned on an hour it overflows. The gutters and pipes to roof are\r\nnot up, and the night before last a heavy flood of rain washed a\r\nquantity of muddy water into the back entrance, which flowed right\r\nacross the kitchen into the back passage and larder, leaving a deposit\r\nof alluvial mud that would have charmed a geologist. However, we have\r\nstopped that for the future by a drain under the doorstep. The new\r\nbreakfast-room is being papered and will look tidy soon. A man has been\r\nto measure for the stairs. The front porch door is promised for\r\nto-morrow, and the stairs, I suppose, in another week. A lot of fresh\r\npointing is to be done, and all the rain-water pipes and the rain-water\r\ncistern with its overflow pipes, and then the greenhouse, and then all\r\nthe outside painting--after which we shall rest for a month and then do\r\nthe inside papering; but whether that can be done before Easter seems\r\nvery doubtful....\r\n\r\nOur alterations still go on. The stairs just up--Friday night we had to\r\ngo outside to get to bed, and Saturday and Sunday we _could_ get up, but\r\nover a chasm, and with alarming creaks. Now it is all firm, but no\r\nhandrail yet. Painters still at work, and whitewashers. Porch\r\ndoor up, with two birds in stained glass--looks fine--proposed\r\nnew name, \"Dicky-bird Lodge.\" Bath fixed, but waiting to be\r\nvarnished--luxurious!...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Wallace had already received four medals from various scientific\r\nsocieties, and at our suggestion he had a case made to hold them all,\r\nwhich is referred to in the following letter. The two new medals\r\nmentioned were those of the Royal Geographical and Linnean Societies. He\r\nattached very little importance to honours conferred upon himself,\r\nexcept in so far as they showed acceptance of \"the truth,\" as he called\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MISS VIOLET WALLACE\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset.

It is\r\nvery good; I think the best book he has written, as his heart was\r\nevidently in it....\r\n\r\nA dreadful thing has happened! Just as I have had my medal-case made,\r\n\"regardless of expense,\" they are going to give me another medal!

The results are much the\r\nsame as in \"Looking Backward\" but brought about in a different and very\r\ningenious manner. It may be called \"Individualistic Socialism.\" I shall\r\nbe up in London soon, I expect, to the first Meetings of the Examiners\r\nin the great science of \"omnium gatherum.\"[44]--Your affec. papa,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

Wednesday evening, [July, 1895]._\r\n\r\nMy dear Annie,--I send you now a box of plants I got on both sides of\r\nthe Furka Pass yesterday, and about here to-day. The Furka Pass on both\r\nsides is a perfect flower-garden, and the two sides have mostly\r\ndifferent species. The violets and anemones were lovely, and I have got\r\ntwo species of glorious gentians.... All the flowers in the box are very\r\nchoice species, and have been carefully dug up, and having seen how they\r\ngrow, I have been thinking of a plan of making a little bed for them on\r\nthe top of the new rockery where there is now nothing particular. Will\r\nyou please plant them out carefully in the zinc tray of peat and\r\nsphagnum that stands outside near the little greenhouse door? Just lift\r\nup the sphagnum and see if the earth beneath is moist, if not give it a\r\nsoaking. Then put them all in, the short-rooted ones in the sphagnum\r\nonly, the others through into the peat. Then give them a good syringing\r\nand put the tray under the shelf outside the greenhouse, and cover with\r\nnewspaper for a day or two. After that I think they will do, keeping\r\nthem moist if the weather is dry. I am getting hosts of curiosities.\r\nTo-day we found four or five species of willows from 1/4 in. to 2 in.\r\nhigh, and other rarities.... In haste for post and dinner.--Your ever\r\naffectionate\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MISS VIOLET WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. October 22, 1897._\r\n\r\nMy dear Violet,--In your previous letter you asked me the conundrum, Why\r\ndoes a wagtail wag its tail? That's quite easy, on Darwinian principles.\r\nMany birds wag their tails. Some Eastern flycatchers--also black and\r\nwhite--wag their long tails up and down when they alight on the ground\r\nor on a branch. Other birds with long tails jerk them up in the air when\r\nthey alight on a branch. Now these varied motions, like the motions of\r\nmany butterflies, caterpillars, and many other animals, must have a use\r\nto the animal, and the most common, or rather the most probable, use is,\r\neither to frighten or to distract an enemy. If a hawk was very hungry\r\nand darted down on a wagtail from up in the air, the wagging tail would\r\nbe seen most distinctly and be aimed at, and thus the bird would be\r\nmissed or at most a feather torn out of the tail. The bird hunts for\r\nfood in the open, on the edges of ponds and streams, and would be\r\nespecially easy to capture, hence the wagging tail has been developed to\r\nbaffle the enemy....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MISS VIOLET WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. March 8, 1899._\r\n\r\nMy dear Violet,--  ... I have now finished reading the \"Maha Bharata,\"\r\nwhich is on the whole very fine--finer, I think, than the \"Iliad.\" I\r\nhave read a good deal of it twice, and it will bear reading many times.\r\nIt corresponds pretty nearly in date with the \"Iliad,\" the scenes it\r\ndescribes being supposed to be about B.C. 1500. Many of the ideas and\r\nmoral teachings are beautiful; equal to the best teaching and superior\r\nto the general practice of to-day. I have made a lot of emendations and\r\nsuggestions, which I am going to send to the translator, as the proofs\r\nhave evidently not been carefully read by any English literary man.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1899 Dr. Wallace began to think of leaving Parkstone,\r\npartly for reasons of health and partly to get a larger garden, if\r\npossible. He spent three years in looking for a suitable spot in many of\r\nthe southern counties, and we were all pressed to join in the search.\r\nFinally he found just the spot he wanted at Broadstone; only three miles\r\naway. The following letters describe his final success--all written\r\nwith his usual optimism and high spirits:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. October 26, 1901._\r\n\r\nMy dear Will,--At length the long quest has come to an end, and I have\r\nagreed to buy three acres of land at Broadstone. Ma and I have just been\r\nover again this morning to consider its capabilities, and the exact\r\nboundaries that will be the most advantageous, as I have here the great\r\nadvantage of choosing exactly what I will have. I only wish I could\r\nafford five acres instead of three, or even ten; but the three will\r\ncontain the very eye of the whole. I enclose you a bit of the 6-inch\r\nordnance on which I have marked the piece I have finally fixed upon in\r\nred chalk. The attractive bit is the small enclosure of one acre, left\r\nrather paler, which is an old orchard in a little valley sloping\r\ndownward to the S.S.E. There are, perhaps, a score of trees in\r\nit--apples, pears, plums and cherries, I believe, and under them a\r\nbeautiful green short turf like a lawn--kept so, I believe, by rabbits.\r\nFrom the top of this orchard is a fine view over moor and heather, then\r\nover the great northern bay of Poole Harbour, and beyond to the Purbeck\r\nHills and out to the sea and the Old Harry headland. It is not very\r\nhigh--about 140 feet, I think, but being on the edge of one of the\r\nplateaus the view is very effective. On the top to the left of the road\r\ntrack is a slightly undulating grass field, of which I have a little\r\nless than an acre. To the right of the fence, and coming down to the\r\nwood, is very rough ground densely covered with heather and dwarf gorse,\r\na great contrast to the field. The wood on the right is mixed but\r\nchiefly oak, I think, with some large firs, one quite grand; while the\r\nwood on the left is quite different, having some very tall Spanish\r\nchestnuts loaded with fruit, some beeches, some firs--but I have not\r\nhad time yet to investigate thoroughly. Thus this little bit of three\r\nacres has five subdivisions, each with a quite distinct character of its\r\nown, and I never remember seeing such variety in such a small area. The\r\nred wavy line is about where I shall have to make my road, for the place\r\nhas now no road, and I think I am very lucky in discovering it and in\r\ngetting it. Another advantage is in the land, which is varied to suit\r\nall crops. I fancy  ... I shall find places to grow most of my choice\r\nshrubs, etc., better than here. I expect bulbs of all kinds will grow\r\nwell, and I mean to plant a thousand or so of snowdrops, crocuses,\r\nsquills, daffodils, etc., in the orchard, where they will look lovely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. November 6, 1901._\r\n\r\nMy dear Will,--  ... I have taken advantage of a foggy cold day to trace\r\nyou a copy of the ground plan of the proposed house.... Of course the\r\nhouse will be much larger than we want, but I look to future value, and\r\nrather than build it smaller, to be enlarged afterwards, I would prefer\r\nto leave the drawing-room and bedroom adjoining with bare walls inside\r\ntill they can be properly finished. The house-keeper's room would be a\r\nnice dining-room, and the hall a parlour and drawing-room combined. But\r\nthe outside must be finished, on account of the garden, creepers, etc.\r\nThe S.E. side (really about S.S.E.) has the fine views. If you can\r\narrange to come at Christmas we will have a picnic on the ground the\r\nfirst sunny day. I was all last week surveying--a very difficult job, to\r\nmark out exactly three acres so as to take in exactly as much of each\r\nkind of ground as I wanted, and with no uninterrupted view over any one\r\nof the boundary lines! I found the sextant, and it was very useful\r\nsetting out the two right angles of the northern boundary. I have not\r\ngot possession yet, but hope to do so by next week. The house, we\r\nreckon, can be built for £1,000 at the outside....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. February 4, 1902._\r\n\r\nDear Mrs. Fisher,--  ... You will be surprised to hear that I have been\r\nso rash as to buy land and to (propose to) build a house! Every other\r\neffort to get a pleasant country cottage with a little land having\r\nfailed, we discovered, accidentally, a charming spot only four miles\r\nfrom this house and half a mile from Broadstone Station, and have\r\nsucceeded in buying three acres, _chosen by myself_, from Lord Wimborne\r\nat what is really a reasonable price. In its contour, views, wood, and\r\ngeneral aspect of wild nature it is almost perfection; and Annie,\r\nViolet, and Will are all pleased and satisfied with it. It is on the\r\nslope of the Broadstone middle plateau, looking south over Poole Harbour\r\nwith the Purbeck Hills beyond, and a little eastward out to the sea....\r\nThe ground is good loam in the orchard, with some sand and clay in the\r\nfield, but this is so open to the sun and air that we are not afraid of\r\nit, as the _house-site_ will be entirely concreted over, and I have\r\narranged for a heating stove in a cellar, which will warm and dry the\r\nwhole basement. In a week or two we hope to begin building, so you may\r\nfancy how busy I am, especially as we are building it without a\r\ncontractor, with the help of a friend.... I go over two or three times a\r\nweek, as I have two gardeners at work. In the summer (should I be still\r\nin the land of the living) I hope you will be able to come and see our\r\nlittle estate, which is to be called by the descriptive name of \"Old\r\nOrchard.\" I have got a good architect to make the working drawings and\r\nhe has designed a very picturesque yet unpretentious house.--Yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. March 2, 1902._\r\n\r\nMy dear Will,--This week's progress has been fairly good although the\r\nwet after the frost has caused two falls in the cellar excavations, and\r\nwe have had to put drain pipes to carry water out, though not much\r\naccumulated.... During the week some horses in the field have not only\r\neaten off the tops of the privet hedge, but have torn up some dozens of\r\nthe plants by the roots, by putting their heads over the 4-foot wire\r\nfence. I am therefore obliged in self-defence to raise the post a foot\r\nhigher and put barbed wire along the top of it. Some cows also got in\r\nour ground one day and ate off the tops of the newly planted laurels,\r\nwhich I am told they are very fond of, so I have got a chain and padlock\r\nfor our gate....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe moved into the new house at Broadstone at the end of November, 1902,\r\nbefore it was quite finished, and here Dr. Wallace lived till the end of\r\nhis life. The garden was an endless source of interest and occupation,\r\nbeing much larger than any he had had since leaving Grays.\r\n\r\nWhen writing he was not easily disturbed and never showed any impatience\r\nor annoyance at any interruption. If interrupted by a question he would\r\npause, pen in hand, and reply or discuss the matter and then resume his\r\nunfinished sentence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STUDY AT \"OLD ORCHARD\"]\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have the substance of his writing in his mind before he\r\ncommenced, and did not often refer to books or to notes, though he\r\nusually had one or two books or papers on the table at hand, and\r\nsometimes he would jump up to get a book from the shelves to verify some\r\nfact or figure. When preparing for a new book or article he read a great\r\nmany works and papers bearing on the subject. These were marked with\r\nnotes and references on the flyleaves; and often by pencil marks to\r\nindicate important passages, but he did not often make separate notes.\r\nHe had a wonderful memory, and stored in his mind the facts and\r\narguments he wished to use, or the places where they were to be found.\r\nHe borrowed many books from libraries, and from these he sometimes made\r\na few notes. He was not a sound sleeper, and frequently lay awake during\r\nthe night, and then it was that he thought out and planned his work. He\r\noften told us with keen delight of some new idea or fresh argument which\r\nhad occurred to him during these waking hours.\r\n\r\nAfter spending months, or sometimes years, in reading and digesting all\r\nthe literary matter he could obtain on a subject,--and forming a plan\r\nfor the treatment of it, he would commence writing, and keep on steadily\r\nfor five or six hours a day if his health permitted. He also wrote to\r\npeople all over the world to obtain the latest facts bearing on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 he began writing \"Man's Place in the Universe.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard. July 8, 1903._\r\n\r\nMy dear Will,--I have just finished going over your notes and\r\ncorrections of the last four chapters. I can't think how I was so stupid\r\nto make the mistake in figures which you corrected. In almost all cases\r\nI have made some modification in accordance with your suggestions, and\r\nthe book will be much improved thereby. I have put in a new paragraph\r\nabout the stars in other parts than the Milky Way and Solar Cluster, but\r\nthere is really nothing known about them. I have also cut out the first\r\nreference to Jupiter altogether. Of course a great deal is speculative,\r\nbut any reply to it is equally speculative. The question is, which\r\nspeculation is most in accordance with the known facts, and not with\r\nprepossessions only?\r\n\r\nConsidering that the book has all been read up and written in less than\r\nthree months, it cannot be expected to be as complete and careful as if\r\nthree years had been expended on it, but then it is fresher perhaps. The\r\nbit about the pure air came to me while writing, and I let myself go.\r\nWhy should I not try and do a little good and make people think a little\r\non such matters, when I have the chance of perhaps more readers than all\r\nmy other books?\r\n\r\nAs to my making too much of Man, of course that is the whole subject of\r\nthe book! And I look at it differently from you, because I know _facts_\r\nabout him you neither know nor believe _yet_. If you are once convinced\r\nof the facts and teachings of Spiritualism, you will think more as I do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to his little book on Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Wimborne. September 26, 1907._\r\n\r\nMy dear Will,--  ... After elaborate revision and correction I have sent\r\nmy MS. of the little \"Mars\" book to Macmillans yesterday.... Will you\r\nread the whole proofs carefully, in the character of the \"intelligent\r\nreader\"? Your fresh eye will detect little slips, bad logic, too\r\npositive statements, etc., which I may have overlooked. It will only be\r\nabout 100 or 150 pages large type--and I want it to be really good, and\r\nfree from blunders that any fool can see....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor some years now he had suffered from repeated attacks of asthma and\r\nbronchitis. He had tried the usual remedies for these complaints without\r\nany good results, and, though still able to write, had then no thought\r\nof beginning any large work; in fact, he considered he had but a few\r\nmore years to live. When Mr. Bruce-Joy came to see him in order to model\r\nthe portrait medallion, he mentioned in the course of conversation that\r\nhe had tried the Salisbury treatment with wonderful results. Our father\r\nwas at first incredulous, but decided to try it in a modified form. He\r\ngave up all starchy foods and ate beef only, cooked in a special manner\r\nto render it more digestible. He found such relief from this change of\r\ndiet that from this time onwards he followed a very strict daily\r\nroutine, which he continued to the end of his life with slight\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nHe made himself a cup of tea on a gas stove in his bedroom at 6 a.m.\r\n(the exact quantity of tea and water having been measured the previous\r\nevening), and boiled it in a small double saucepan for a definite time\r\nby the watch. He always said this cup of tea tasted better than at any\r\nother time of the day. He then returned to bed and slept till 8 a.m.\r\nDuring his last two or three years he suffered from rheumatism in his\r\nshoulder and it took him a long time to dress, and he called in the aid\r\nof his gardener in the last year, who acted as his valet. While dressing\r\nhe prepared a cup of cocoa on the gas stove, which he carried into the\r\nstudy (next door) at 9 a.m. This was all he had for breakfast, and he\r\ntook it while reading the paper or his letters.\r\n\r\nDinner at one o'clock was taken with his family, and he usually related\r\nany interesting or striking news he had read in the paper, or in his\r\ncorrespondence, and commented upon it, or perhaps he would tell us of\r\nsome new flower in the garden.\r\n\r\nHe drank hot water with a little Canary sack and a dash of soda-water,\r\nto which he added a spoonful of plum jam. He was very fond of sweet\r\nthings, such as puddings, but he had to partake sparingly of them, and\r\nit was a great temptation when some dish of which he was particularly\r\nfond was placed upon the table.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he usually took a nap in the study before resuming work or\r\ngoing into the garden.\r\n\r\nTea was at four o'clock, and consisted only of a cup of tea, which he\r\nmade himself in the study, unless there were visitors whom he wished to\r\nsee, when he would sometimes take it into the drawing-room and make it\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAfter tea he again wrote, or took a turn in the garden if the weather\r\nand season permitted. Latterly he spent a good part of the afternoon and\r\nevening reading and dozing on the sofa, and only worked at short\r\nintervals when he felt equal to it.\r\n\r\nSupper, at seven, was a repetition of dinner, and he took it with us in\r\nthe dining-room. After supper he generally read a novel before the fire\r\nexcept in the very hottest weather, and he frequently dozed on and off\r\ntill he retired at eleven. He made himself a cup of cocoa while\r\npreparing for bed, and drank it just before lying down.\r\n\r\nFor the last year or two it was a constant difficulty with him to secure\r\nenough nourishment without aggravating his ailments by indigestion.\r\nDuring this time he suffered continuous discomfort, though he seldom\r\ngave utterance to complaint or allowed it to affect the uniform\r\nequability of his temper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1903 his daughter came to live with her parents, who generously\r\nallowed her to take three or four children as pupils. At first we feared\r\nthey might bother our father, but he really enjoyed seeing them about\r\nand talking to them. He was always interested in any new child, and if\r\nfor a short time none were forthcoming, always lamented the fact. At\r\ndinner the children would ask him all sorts of questions, very amusing\r\nones sometimes. They were also intensely interested in what he ate, and\r\nwatched with speechless wonder when they saw him eating orange, banana,\r\nand sugar with his meat.\r\n\r\nOne of these early pupils, Reginald B. Rathbone, has sent reminiscences\r\nwhich are so characteristic that we give them as they stand:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I have stayed at Dr. Wallace's house on three occasions; the first two\r\nwere when I was only about eight or nine years old, and my recollections\r\nof him at that time are therefore necessarily somewhat dim. Certain\r\nthings, however, have stuck in my memory. I went there quite prepared to\r\nsee a very venerable and imposing-looking old gentleman, and filled in\r\nadvance with much awe and respect for him. As regards his personal\r\nappearance I was by no mean disappointed, as his tall, slightly-stooping\r\nfigure, long white hair and beard, and his spectacles fulfilled my\r\nhighest expectations, I remember being struck with the kindly look of\r\nhis eyes, and indeed they did not belie his nature, for he always\r\ntreated me with great kindness, patience and indulgence, which is\r\nsomewhat remarkable considering my age, and how exasperating I must have\r\nbeen sometimes. I soon began to regard him as a never-failing fount of\r\nwisdom, and as one who could answer any question one liked to put to\r\nhim. Of this latter fact I was not slow to take advantage. I plied him\r\nwith every kind of question my imaginative young brain could conceive,\r\nusually beginning with 'why.'\r\n\r\n\"He nearly always gave me an answer, and what is more, a satisfactory\r\none, and well within the scope of my limited understanding. These\r\ndefinite, satisfactory answers of his used to afford me great pleasure,\r\nit being quite a new experience for me to have all my questions answered\r\nfor me in this way. These answers, as I have said, were nearly always\r\nforthcoming, though indeed, on one or two occasions, in answer to an\r\nespecially ridiculous query of mine he would answer, 'That is a very\r\nfoolish question, Reggie.' But this was very rare.\r\n\r\n\"I remember taking a great interest in what Dr. Wallace ate. He had a\r\nhearty appetite, and was no believer in vegetarianism, for at lunch his\r\ndiet consisted chiefly of cold beef, liberally seasoned with various\r\nsauces and relishes, also vinegar. I used to gaze at these bottles with\r\ngreat admiration. Whenever there were peas he used to take large\r\nquantities of sugar with them. This greatly aroused my curiosity, and I\r\nquestioned him about it. 'Why,' said he, 'peas themselves contain sugar;\r\nit is, therefore, much more sensible to take sugar with them than salt.'\r\nAnd he recounted an anecdote of how an eminent personage he had once\r\ndined with had been waited on with great respect and attention by all\r\npresent, but salt was offered to him with the peas. 'If you want to make\r\nme quite happy,' said the great man, 'you will give me some sugar with\r\nmy peas.' His favourite drink, I remember, was Canary sack.\r\n\r\n\"He had a strongly humorous side, and always enjoyed a good laugh. As\r\nan instance of this, I will recount the following incident: When I had\r\nreturned home after my first visit to 'The Old Orchard,' my sister,\r\nthree years older than myself, and I had a heated argument on the\r\nsubject of the number of stomachs in a cow. I insisted it was three;\r\nshe, on the other hand, held that it was seven. After a long and fierce\r\ndispute, I exclaimed: 'Well, let us write to Dr. Wallace, and he will\r\nsettle it for us and tell us the real number.' This we did, the brazen\r\naudacity of the proceeding not striking us at the time. By return of\r\npost we received a letter which, alas! I have unfortunately not\r\npreserved, but the substance of which I well remember. 'Dear Irene and\r\nReggie,' it ran, 'Your dispute as to the number of stomachs which a cow\r\npossesses can be settled and rectified by a simple mathematical process\r\nusually called subtraction, thus:\r\n\r\n  Irene's Cow         7 stomachs\r\n  Reggie's Cow        3 stomachs\r\n                      ----------\r\n  The Farmer's cow    4 stomachs.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Wallace then went on to explain the names and uses of the four\r\nstomachs.\r\n\r\n\"Two instances of his fun come to my mind as I write. 'Why,' I asked,\r\n'do you sometimes take off your spectacles to read the paper?' 'Because\r\nI can see better without 'em,' he said. 'Then why,' I asked again, 'do\r\nyou ever wear them?' 'Because I can see better with 'em,' was the reply.\r\nThe other instance relates to chloroform. He was describing the agonies\r\nsuffered by those who had to undergo amputation before the discovery of\r\nanæsthetics, whereas nowadays, he said, 'you are put under chloroform,\r\nthen wake up and find your arm cut off, having felt nothing. Or you wake\r\nup and find your leg cut off. Or you wake up and find your head cut\r\noff!' He then laughed heartily at his own joke.\r\n\r\n\"These are just a few miscellaneous reminiscences, many of them no doubt\r\ntrivial, but they may perhaps be not entirely devoid of interest, when\r\nit is remembered that they are the impressions and recollections of one\r\nwho was then a boy of eight years old.\"--B.B.K.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year 1908 was very auspicious to Dr. Wallace. To begin with, it was\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the reading of the Darwin and Wallace joint\r\npapers on the Origin of Species before the Linnean Society, an event\r\nwhich was commemorated in the way described elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, and just as he was beginning to recover from a spell of\r\nbad health, he was invited to give a lecture at the Royal Institution,\r\nthe prospect of which seemed to have upon him a most stimulating effect;\r\nhe at once began to think about a suitable subject.\r\n\r\nFollowing closely on this came the news that the Order of Merit was to\r\nbe conferred upon him. His letters to his son give the details of this\r\neventful period:[45]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne.

When\r\nI was almost at my worst, feeling very bad, I had a letter inviting me\r\nto give an evening lecture at the Royal Institution, for their Jubilee\r\nof the \"Origin of Species\"! Of course I decided at once to decline as\r\nimpossible, etc., having nothing new to say, etc. But a few hours\r\nafterwards an idea suddenly came to me for a very fine lecture, if I can\r\nwork it out as I hope--and the more I thought over it the better it\r\nseemed. So, two days back, I wrote to Sir W. Crookes--the Honorary\r\nSecretary, who had written to me--accepting provisionally!... Here is\r\nanother \"crowning honour\"--the most unexpected of all!...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne.

This morning the Copley Medals came, gold and\r\nsilver, smaller than any of the others, but very beautifully designed;\r\nthe face has the Royal Society's arms, with Copley's name, and\r\n\"Dignissimo,\" and my name below. The reverse is the Royal Arms. By the\r\nsame post came a letter from the Lord Chancellor's Office informing me,\r\nto my great relief, that the King had been graciously pleased to\r\ndispense with my personal attendance at the investiture of the Order of\r\nMerit,  ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR.

I am duly\r\n\"invested,\" and have got two engrossed documents, both signed by the\r\nKing, one appointing me a member of the \"Order of Merit\" with all sorts\r\nof official and legal phrases, the other a dispensation from being\r\npersonally \"invested\" by the King--as Col. Legge explained, to safeguard\r\nme as having a right to the Order in case anybody says I was not\r\n\"invested.\"  ... Colonel Legge was a very pleasant, jolly kind of man,\r\nand he told us he was in attendance on the German Emperor when he was\r\nstaying near Christchurch last summer, and went for many drives with the\r\nEmperor only, all about the country.... Col. Legge got here at 2.40, and\r\nhad to leave at 3.20 (at station), so we got a carriage from Wimborne to\r\nmeet the train and take him back, and Ma gave him some tea, and he said\r\nhe had got a nice little place at Stoke Poges but with no view like\r\nours, and he showed me how to wear the Order and was very pleasant: and\r\nwe were all pleased....\r\n\r\nThe next letter refers to the discovery of a rare moth and some beetles\r\nin the root of an orchid. It was certainly a strange yet pleasant\r\ncoincidence that these creatures should find themselves in Dr. Wallace's\r\ngreenhouse, where alone they would be noticed and appreciated as\r\nsomething uncommon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. February 23, 1909._\r\n\r\nMy dear Will,--  ... In my last letter I did not say anything about my\r\nmorning at the Nat. Hist. Museum.... What I enjoyed most was seeing some\r\nsplendid New Guinea butterflies which Mr. Rothschild[46] and his\r\ncurator, Mr. Jordan, brought up from Tring on purpose to show me. I\r\ncould hardly have imagined anything so splendid as some of these. I also\r\nsaw some of the new paradise birds in the British Museum. But Mr.\r\nRothschild says they have five times as many at Tring, and much finer\r\nspecimens, and he invited me to spend a week-end at Tring and see the\r\nMuseum. So I may go, perhaps--in the summer.\r\n\r\nBut I have a curious thing to tell you about insect collecting at \"Old\r\nOrchard.\" About five months back I was examining one of the clumps of an\r\norchid in the glass case--which had been sent me from Buenos Ayres by\r\nMr. John Hall--when three pretty little beetles dropped out of it, on\r\nthe edge of the tank, and I only managed to catch two of them. They were\r\npretty little Longicornes, about an inch long, but very slender and\r\ngraceful, though only of a yellowish-brown colour. I sent them up to the\r\nBritish Museum asking the name, and telling them they could keep them if\r\nof any use. They told me they were a species of the large South American\r\ngenus Ibidion, but they had not got it in the collection!\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday before Christmas Day I was taking my evening inspection\r\nof the orchids, etc., in the glass case when a largish insect flew by my\r\nface, and when it settled it looked like a handsome moth or butterfly.\r\nIt was brilliant orange on the lower wings, the upper being shaded\r\norange brown, very moth-like, but the antennæ were clubbed like a\r\nbutterfly's. At first I thought it was a butterfly that mimicked a moth,\r\nbut I had never seen anything like it before.\r\n\r\nNext morning I got a glass jar half filled with bruised laurel leaves,\r\nand Ma got it in, and after a day or two I set it, clumsily, and meant\r\nto take it to London, but had no small box to put it in. I told Mr.\r\nRothschild about it, and he said it sounded like a Castnia--curious\r\nSouth American moths very near to butterflies. So he got out the drawer\r\nwith them, but mine was not there; then he got another drawer\r\nhalf-empty, and there it was--only a coloured drawing, but exactly like.\r\nIt had been described, but neither the Museum nor Mr. Rothschild had got\r\nit! I had had the orchids nearly a year and a half, so it must have\r\nbeen, in the chrysalis all that time and longer, which Mr. Rothschild\r\nsaid was the case with the Castnias. On going home I searched, and found\r\nthe brown chrysalis-case it had come out of among the roots of the same\r\norchid the little Longicornes had dropped from. It is, I am pretty sure,\r\na Brazilian species, and I have written to ask Mr. Hall if he knows\r\nwhere it came from. I have sent the moth and chrysalis to Prof. Poulton\r\n(I had promised it to him at the lecture) for the Oxford collection, and\r\nhe is greatly pleased with it; and especially with its history--one\r\nquite small bit of an orchid, after more than a year in a greenhouse,\r\nproducing a rare or new beetle and an equally rare moth!...\r\n\r\nI am glad to say I feel really better than any time the last ten\r\nyears.--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. O. Pickard-Cambridge has kindly written his reminiscence of\r\nanother very curious coincidence connected with a natural history\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n\"Some years ago, on looking over some insect drawers in my collection,\r\nMr. A.R. Wallace exclaimed, 'Why, there is my old Sarawak spider!'\r\n'Well! that is curious,' I replied, 'because that spider has caused me\r\nmuch trouble and thought as to who might have caught it, and where; I\r\nhad only lately decided to describe and figure it, even though I could\r\ngive the name of neither locality nor finder, being, as it seemed to me,\r\nof a genus and species not as yet recorded; also I had, as you see,\r\nprovisionally conferred your name upon it, although I had not the\r\nremotest idea that it had anything else to do with you.' 'Well,' said\r\nMr. Wallace, 'if it is my old spider it ought to have my own private\r\nticket on the pin underneath.' 'It has a ticket,' I replied, 'but it is\r\nunintelligible to me; the spider came to me among some other items by\r\npurchase at the sale of Mr. Wilson Saunders' collections.' 'If it is\r\nmine,' said Wallace (examining it), 'the ticket should be so-and-so. And\r\nit is! I caught this spider at Sarawak, and specially noted its\r\nremarkable form. I remember it as if it were yesterday, and now I find\r\nit here, and you about to publish it as a new genus and species to\r\nwhich, in total ignorance of whence it came or who caught it, you have\r\ngiven my name!' Thus it stands, and '_Friula Wallacii_, Camb. (family\r\nGasteracanthidæ), taken by Alfred Russel Wallace at Sarawak,' is the\r\n(unique as I believe) type specimen, in my collection.\"--O.P.C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Wallace was very fond of reading good novels, and usually spent an\r\nhour or two, before retiring to bed, with what he called a \"good\r\ndomestic story.\" One of his favourite authors was Marion Crawford.\r\nPoetry appealed to him very strongly, and he had a good memory for his\r\nfavourite verses, especially for those he had learned in his youth.\r\nAmongst his books were over fifty volumes of poetry.\r\n\r\nHe liked to see friends or interesting visitors, but he was rather\r\nnervous with strangers until he became interested in what they had to\r\nsay. He enjoyed witty conversation, and especially a good story well\r\ntold. No one laughed more heartily than he when he was much amused, and\r\nhe would slap his hands upon his knees with delight.\r\n\r\nHe was very accessible to anyone who might have something to say worth\r\nhearing, and he had a great many visitors, especially during the last\r\nten years of his life. Many people distinguished in science, literature,\r\nor politics called upon him, and he always enjoyed these visits, and the\r\nexcitement of them seemed to have no bad effect upon him, even in the\r\nlast year, when we sometimes feared he might be fatigued by them. In\r\nconsequence of his sympathy with many heterodox ideas he frequently had\r\nvisits from \"cranks\" who wished to secure his support for some new\r\ntheory or \"discovery.\" He would listen patiently, perhaps ask a few\r\nquestions, and then endeavour to point out their fallacies. He would\r\namuse us afterwards by describing their \"preposterous ideas,\" and if\r\nmuch bored, he would speak of them as \"muffs.\" He was loath to hurt\r\ntheir feelings, but he generally ended by expressing his opinion quite\r\nclearly, occasionally to their discomfiture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Littledale has contributed some reminiscences which may be\r\nintroduced here.\r\n\r\n\"When I first met Dr. Wallace the conversation turned on the types of\r\nvisitors that came to see him, and he gave us an amusing account of two\r\nyoung women who called on him to read through a most ponderous treatise\r\nrelating to the Universe (I think it was). At all events the treatise\r\nproved, amongst other things, that Kepler's laws were all wrong. Dr.\r\nWallace was very busy at the time, and politely declined to undertake\r\nthe task. I remember him well describing with his hands the size of this\r\nenormous manuscript and laughing heartily as he detailed how the writer\r\nof the manuscript, the elder of the two sisters, persistently tried to\r\npersuade him that her theories were all absolutely proved in the work,\r\nwhile the younger sister acted as a sort of echo to her sister. The\r\nclimax came in a fit of weeping, and, as Dr. Wallace described it, the\r\nwhole fabric of the universe was washed away in a flood of tears.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion, when I was asked by Mrs. Wallace to see Dr. Wallace\r\nprofessionally, he was lying on the sofa in his study by the fire\r\nwrapped up in rugs, having just got over a bad shivering attack or\r\nrigor. His temperature was 104° Fahr., and all the other usual signs of\r\nacute fever were present, but nothing to enable one to form a positive\r\nopinion as to the cause. It must have been forty years since he had been\r\nin the tropics, but I think he felt that it was an attack of malarial\r\nfever. Knowing my patient, my treatment consisted in asking what he was\r\ngoing to do for himself. 'Well,' he said, 'I am going to have a hot bath\r\nand then go to bed, and to-morrow I shall get up and go into the garden\r\nas usual.' And he was out in the garden next day when I went to see him.\r\nThis was an instance, doubtless one of many, of the 'will to live,'\r\nwhich carried him through a long life.\r\n\r\n\"Once, when he was talking about the gaps in the evolution of life, viz.\r\nbetween the inorganic and organic, between vegetable and animal, and\r\nbetween animal and man, I asked, 'Why postulate a beginning at all? We\r\nare satisfied with illimitability at one end, why not at the other?'\r\n'For the simple reason,' he said, 'that the mind cannot comprehend\r\nanything that has never had a beginning.'\r\n\r\n\"What attracted me to him most, I think, was his remarkable simplicity\r\nof language, whatever the topic of conversation might be, and this not\r\nthe simplicity of the great mind bringing itself down to the level of\r\nthe ordinary individual, but his customary mode of expression. I have\r\nheard him say that he felt the need of the fluency of speech which\r\nHuxley possessed, as he had to cast about for the expression that he\r\nwanted. This may have been the case when he was lecturing, but I\r\ncertainly never noticed it in conversation.\"--H.E.L.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Wallace was always interested in young men and others who were going\r\nabroad with the intention of studying Natural History, and gave them\r\nwhat advice and help he could. He much enjoyed listening to the\r\naccounts given by travellers of the scenes, animals and plants and\r\nnative life they had seen, and deplored the so-called civilising of the\r\nnatives, which, in his opinion, generally meant their exploitation by\r\nEuropeans, leading to their deterioration and extermination.\r\n\r\nHis nervousness with strangers sometimes led them to form quite\r\nerroneous impressions. It occasionally found expression in a nervous\r\nlaugh which had nothing to do with amusement or humour, but was often\r\nheard when he was most serious and felt most deeply. One or two\r\ninterviewers described it as a \"chuckle,\" an expression which suggested\r\nfeelings most opposite to those which he really experienced.\r\n\r\nAlthough he could draw and sketch well, he did not take much pleasure in\r\nit, and only exercised his skill when there was a definite object in\r\nview. His sketches show a very delicate touch, and denote painstaking\r\naccuracy, while some are quite artistic. He much preferred drawing with\r\ncompasses and squares, there being a practical object in his mind for\r\nwhich the plans or drawings were only the first steps. Even in his\r\nninety-first year he found much enjoyment in drawing plans, and spent\r\nmany hours in designing alterations to a small cottage which his\r\ndaughter had bought.\r\n\r\nHe was interested in literary puzzles and humorous stories, and he\r\npreserved in an old scrap-book any that appealed to him. He would\r\nsometimes read some of them on festive occasions, or when we had\r\nchildren's parties, and sometimes he laughed so heartily himself that he\r\ncould not go on reading.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the years during which Dr. Wallace lived at Broadstone, the\r\nlast decade, when he was between eighty and ninety years of age, this\r\nperiod seems to have been one of the most eventful, and as full of work\r\nand mental activity as any previous period. He never tired of his\r\ngarden, in which he succeeded in growing a number of rare and curious\r\nshrubs and plants. Our mother shared his delight and interest in the\r\ngarden, and knew a great deal about flowers. She had an excellent memory\r\nfor their botanical names, and he often asked her the name of some\r\nplant which he was pointing out to a friend and which for the moment he\r\nhad forgotten. She was very fond of roses and of primroses, and there\r\nwas a fine display of these flowers at \"Old Orchard.\" She was successful\r\nin \"budding\" and in hybridising roses, and produced several beautiful\r\nvarieties. She was proficient in raising seeds, and he sometimes placed\r\nsome which he received from abroad in her charge.\r\n\r\nWhen he first came to live at Broadstone he frequently took short walks\r\nto the post or to the bank, and sometimes went by train to Poole on\r\nbusiness, but he gradually went out less and less, till in the last few\r\nyears he seldom went outside the garden, but strolled about looking at\r\nthe flowers or supervising the construction of a new bed or rockery.\r\nDuring his last years his gardener wheeled him about the garden in a\r\nbath-chair when he did not feel strong enough to walk all the time.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, after his last two small books were written, he did no more\r\nwriting except correspondence. This he attended to himself, except on\r\none or two occasions when he was not very well or felt tired, when he\r\nasked one of us to answer a few letters for him. He took great interest\r\nin a small cottage which had recently been acquired on the Purbeck Hills\r\nnear the sea, and in September, much against our wishes, he went there\r\nfor two nights, taking the gardener to look after him. Luckily the\r\nweather was fine, and the change and excitement seemed to do him good,\r\nand during the next month he was very bright and cheerful, though, as\r\nsome of his letters to his old friend Dr. Richard Norris and to Dr.\r\nLittledale show, he had been becoming increasingly weak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MISS NORRIS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. December 10, 1912._\r\n\r\nMy dear Miss Norris,--I am very sorry to hear that your father is so\r\npoorly. The weather is terribly gloomy, and I have not been outside my\r\nrooms and greenhouse for more than an hour a week perhaps, for the last\r\ntwo months, and feel the better for it. Just now I feel better than I\r\nhave done for a year past, having at last, I think, hit upon a proper\r\ndiet, though I find it very difficult to avoid eating or drinking too\r\nmuch of what I like best.... It is one of my fads that I hate to waste\r\nanything, and it is that partly which makes it so difficult for me to\r\navoid overeating. From a boy I was taught to leave no scraps on my\r\nplate, and from this excellent general rule of conduct I now suffer in\r\nmy old age!...--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO DR. LITTLEDALE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. January 11, 1913._\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Littledale,--Many thanks for your kind congratulations and good\r\nwishes.[47] I am glad to say I feel still able to jog on a few years\r\nlonger in this _very good_ world--for those who can make the best of it.\r\n\r\nI am now suffering most from \"eczema,\" which has settled in my legs, so\r\nthat I cannot stand or walk for any length of time. Perhaps that is an\r\noutlet for something worse, as I still enjoy my meals, and usually feel\r\nas well as ever, though I have to be very careful as to _what_ I\r\neat.--With best wishes for your prosperity, yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO DR. NORRIS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. October 4, 1913._\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr. Norris,--Except for a continuous weakness I seem improving a\r\nlittle in general health, and the chronic rheumatic pain in my right\r\nshoulder has almost passed away in the last month (after about three\r\nyears), and I can impute it to nothing but about a quarter of a pint a\r\nday of Bulmer's Cider! A most agreeable medicine! The irritability of\r\nthe skin, however, continues, though the inflammation of the legs has\r\nsomewhat diminished....\r\n\r\nMy increasing weakness is now my most serious trouble, as it prevents me\r\nreally from doing any more work, and causes a large want of balance, and\r\nliability to fall down. Even moving about the room after books, etc.,\r\ndressing and undressing, make me want to lie down and rest....\r\n\r\nWith kind remembrances to your daughter, believe me yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn disposition Dr. Wallace was cheerful, and very optimistic, and\r\nremarkably even-tempered. If irritated he quickly recovered, and soon\r\nforgot all about the annoyance, but he was always strongly indignant at\r\nany injustice to the weak or helpless. When worried by business\r\ndifficulties or losses he very soon recovered his optimism, and seemed\r\nquite confident that all would come right (as indeed it generally did),\r\nand latterly he became convinced that all his past troubles were really\r\nblessings in disguise, without which as a stimulant he would have done\r\nno useful work.\r\n\r\nHis life was a happy one, and even the discomforts caused by his\r\nailments, which were at times very acute for days together, never\r\nprevented him from enjoying the contemplation of his flowers, nor\r\ndisturbed the serenity of his temper, nor caused him to complain.\r\n\r\nAlthough rather delicate all his life, he rarely stayed in bed; in fact,\r\nonly once in our memory, during an illness at Parkstone, did he do so,\r\nand then only for one day.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, November 1st (1913), he walked round the garden, and on the\r\nfollowing day seemed very bright, and enjoyed his dinner and supper, but\r\nabout nine o'clock he felt faint and shivered violently. We called in\r\nDr. Norman, who came in about an hour, and we heard them having a long\r\ntalk and even laughing, in the study. As the doctor left he said,\r\n\"Wonderful man! he knows so much. I can do nothing for him.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day he did not get up at the usual time, but we felt no anxiety\r\nuntil noon, when he still showed no inclination to rise. He appeared to\r\nbe dozing, and said he wanted nothing. From that time he gradually sank\r\ninto semi-consciousness, and at half-past nine in the morning of Friday,\r\nNovember 7th, quietly passed on to that other life in which he was such\r\na firm believer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nSocial and Political Views\r\n\r\n    \"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are\r\n    things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches\r\n    and honour are things to be ashamed of.\"--CONFUCIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the above sentences, written long before the dawn of Christian\r\ncivilisation, we have an apt summary of the social and political views\r\nof Alfred Russel Wallace.\r\n\r\nAs we have stated in a previous chapter, it was during his short stay in\r\nLondon as a boy, when he was led to study the writings and methods of\r\nRobert Owen, of New Lanark, that his mind first opened to the\r\nconsideration of the inequalities of our social life.\r\n\r\nDuring the six years which he spent in land-surveying he obtained a more\r\npractical knowledge of the laws pertaining to public and private\r\nproperty as they affected the lives and habits of both squire and\r\npeasant.\r\n\r\nThe village inn, or public-house, was then the only place where men\r\ncould meet to discuss topics of mutual interest, and it was there that\r\nyoung Wallace and his brother spent some of their own leisure hours\r\nlistening to and conversing with the village rustics. The conversation\r\nwas not ordinarily of an educational character, but occasionally\r\nexperienced farmers would discuss agricultural and land problems which\r\nwere beginning to interest Wallace.\r\n\r\nIn reading his books and essays written more than seventy years later,\r\nwe are struck with the exceptional opportunities which he had of\r\ncomparing social conditions, and commercial and individual prosperity\r\nduring that long period, and of witnessing the introduction of many\r\ninventions. He used to enjoy recalling many of the discussions between\r\nintelligent mechanics which he heard of in his early days regarding the\r\nintroduction of the steam-engine. One and another declared that the grip\r\nof the engine on the rails would not be sufficient to draw heavy trucks\r\nor carriages; that the wheels, in fact, would whiz round instead of\r\ngoing on, and that it would be necessary to sprinkle sand in front of\r\nthe wheels, or make the tyres rough like files. About this time, too,\r\nthere arose a keen debate upon the relative merits of the new railroads\r\nand the old canals. Many thought that the former could never compete\r\nwith the latter in carrying heavy goods; but facts soon proved\r\notherwise, for in one district alone the traffic of the canal, within\r\ntwo years of the coming of the railway, decreased by 1,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIt was during these years, and when he and his brother were making a\r\nsurvey for the enclosure of some common lands near Llandrindod Wells,\r\nthat Wallace finally became aware of the injustice towards the labouring\r\nclasses of the General Enclosure Act.\r\n\r\nIn this particular locality the land to be enclosed consisted of a large\r\nextent of moor, and mountain which, with other common rights, had for\r\nmany years enabled the occupants of the scattered cottages around to\r\nkeep a horse, cow, or a few sheep, and thus make a fairly comfortable\r\nliving. Under the Act, the whole of this open land was divided among the\r\nadjacent landowners of the parish or manor, in proportion to the size or\r\nvalue of their estates. Thus, to those who actually possessed much, much\r\nwas given; whilst to those who only nominally owned a little land, even\r\nthat was taken away in return for a small compensation which was by no\r\nmeans as valuable to them as the right to graze their cattle. In spite\r\nof the statement set forth in the General Enclosure Act--\"Whereas it is\r\nexpedient to facilitate the enclosure and improvement of common and\r\nother lands now subject to the rights of property which obstruct\r\ncultivation and the productive employment of labour,\" Wallace\r\nascertained many years later that no single part of the land so enclosed\r\nhad been cultivated by those to whom it was given, though certain\r\nportions had been let or sold at fabulous prices for building purposes,\r\nto accommodate summer visitors to the neighbourhood. Thus the\r\nunfortunate people who had formerly enjoyed home, health, and\r\ncomparative prosperity in the cottages scattered over this common land\r\nhad been obliged to migrate to the large towns, seeking for fresh\r\nemployment and means of subsistence, or had become \"law-created\r\npaupers\"; whilst to crown all, the piece of common originally \"reserved\"\r\nfor the benefit of the inhabitants had been turned into golf-links!\r\n\r\nAgain and again Wallace drew attention to the fundamental duties of\r\nlandownership, maintaining that the public, as a whole, had become so\r\nblinded by custom that no effectual social reform would ever be\r\nestablished unless some strenuous and unremitting effort was made to\r\nrecover the land by law from those who had made the land laws and who\r\nhad niched the common heritage of humanity for their own private\r\naggrandisement.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the actual value of land, Wallace pointed out that the\r\nlast valuation was made in the year 1692, and therefore, with the\r\nincrease of value through minerals and other products since then, the\r\narrears of land tax due up to 1905 would amount to more than the value\r\nof all the agricultural land of our country at the present time;\r\ntherefore existing landlords, in clamouring for their alleged rights of\r\nproperty, might find out that those \"rights\" no longer exist.\r\n\r\nYet another point on which he insisted was the right of way through\r\nfields or woodlands, and especially beside the sea. With the advent of\r\nthe motor-car and other swift means of locomotion, the public roads are\r\nno longer safe and pleasurable for pedestrians; besides the iniquitous\r\nfact that hundreds are kept from enjoying the beauties of nature by the\r\nutterly selfish and useless reservations of such by-paths by the\r\nlandowner.\r\n\r\n\"This all-embracing system of land-robbery,\" again he writes, \"for which\r\nnothing is too great or too small; which has absorbed meadow and forest,\r\nmoor and mountain, which has appropriated most of our rivers and lakes\r\nand the fish that live in them; making the agriculturist pay for his\r\nseaweed manure and the fisherman for his bait of shell-fish; which has\r\ndesolated whole counties to replace men by sheep or cattle, and has\r\ndestroyed fields and cottages to make a wilderness for deer and grouse;\r\nwhich has stolen the commons and filched the roadside wastes; which has\r\ndriven the labouring poor into the cities, and thus been the chief cause\r\nof the misery, disease, and early death of thousands  ... it is the\r\nadvocates of this inhuman system who, when a partial restitution of\r\ntheir unholy gains is proposed, are the loudest in their cries of\r\n'robbery'!\r\n\r\n\"But all the robbery, all the spoliation, all the legal and illegal\r\nfilching, has been on _their_ side.... They made the laws to legalise\r\ntheir actions, and, some day, we, the people, will make laws which will\r\nnot only legalise but justify our process of restitution. It will\r\njustify it, because, unlike their laws, which always took from the poor\r\nto give to the rich--to the very class which made the laws--ours will\r\nonly take from the superfluity of the rich, _not_ to give to the poor or\r\nto any individuals, but to so administer as to enable every man to live\r\nby honest work, to restore to the whole people their birthright in their\r\nnative soil, and to relieve all alike from a heavy burden of unnecessary\r\nand unjust taxation. _This_ will be the true statesmanship of the\r\nfuture, and it will be justified alike by equity, by ethics, and by\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the facts and reasons upon which Dr. Wallace based his\r\nstrenuous advocacy of Land Nationalisation.[48] It was only by slow\r\ndegrees that he arrived at some of the conclusions propounded in his\r\nlater years, but once having grasped their full importance to the social\r\nand moral well-being of the community, he held them to the last.\r\n\r\nThe first book which tended to fasten his attention upon these matters\r\nwas \"Social Statics,\" by Herbert Spencer, but in 1870 the publication of\r\nhis \"Malay Archipelago\" brought him into personal contact with John\r\nStuart Mill, through whose invitation he became a member of the General\r\nCommittee of the Land Tenure Reform Association. On the formation of the\r\nLand Nationalisation Society in 1880 he retired from the Association,\r\nand devoted himself to the larger issues which the new Society embraced.\r\n\r\nSoon after the latter Society was started, Henry George, the American\r\nauthor of \"Progress and Poverty,\" came to England, and Wallace had many\r\nopportunities of hearing him speak in public and of discussing matters\r\nof common interest in private. In spite of the ridicule poured upon\r\nHenry George's book by many eminent social reformers, Wallace\r\nconsistently upheld its general principles.\r\n\r\nHis second work on these various subjects was a small book entitled \"Bad\r\nTimes,\" issued in 1885, in which he went deeply into the root causes of\r\nthe depression in trade which had lasted since 1874. The facts there\r\ngiven were enlarged upon and continually brought up to date in his later\r\nwritings. Articles which had appeared in various magazines were gathered\r\ntogether and included, with those on other subjects, in \"Studies,\r\nScientific and Social.\" His last three books, which include his ideas on\r\nsocial diseases and the best method of preventing them, were \"The\r\nWonderful Century,\" \"Social Environment and Moral Progress,\" and \"The\r\nRevolt of Democracy\"; the two last being issued, as we have seen, in\r\n1913, the year of his death.\r\n\r\nIn \"Social Environment and Moral Progress\" the conclusion of his\r\nvehement survey of our moral and social conditions was startling: \"_It\r\nis not too much to say that our whole system of Society is rotten from\r\ntop to bottom, and that the social environment as a whole in relation to\r\nour possibilities and our claims is the worst that the world has ever\r\nseen_.\"\r\n\r\nThat terrible indictment was doubly underscored in his MS.\r\n\r\nWhat, in his mature judgment, were the causes and remedies? He set them\r\nout in this order:\r\n\r\n1. The evils are due, broadly and generally, to our living under a\r\nsystem of universal competition for the means of existence, the remedy\r\nfor which is equally universal co-operation.\r\n\r\n2. It may also be defined as a system of economic antagonism, as of\r\nenemies, the remedy being a system of economic brotherhood, as of a\r\ngreat family, or of friends.\r\n\r\n3. Our system is also one of monopoly by a few of all the means of\r\nexistence--the land, without access to which no life is possible; and\r\ncapital, or the results of stored-up labour, which is now in the\r\npossession of a limited number of capitalists, and therefore is also a\r\nmonopoly. The remedy is freedom of access to land and capital for all.\r\n\r\n4. Also, it may be defined as social injustice, inasmuch as the few in\r\neach generation are allowed to inherit the stored-up wealth of all\r\npreceding generations, while the many inherit nothing. The remedy is to\r\nadopt the principle of equality of opportunity for all, or of universal\r\n_inheritance by the State in trust for the whole community_.\r\n\r\n\"We have,\" he finally concluded, \"ourselves created an immoral or\r\nunmoral social environment. To undo its inevitable results we must\r\nreverse our course. We must see that _all_ our economic legislation,\r\n_all_ our social reforms, are in the very opposite direction to those\r\nhitherto adopted, and that they tend in the direction of one or other of\r\nthe four fundamental remedies I have suggested. In this way only can we\r\nhope to change our existing immoral environment into a moral one, and\r\n_initiate a new era of Moral Progress._\" The \"Revolt of Democracy\"[49]\r\nwas addressed directly to the Labour Party. And once again he drew a\r\nvivid picture of how, during the whole of the nineteenth century, there\r\nwas a continuous advance in the application of scientific discovery to\r\nthe arts, especially to the invention and application of labour-saving\r\nmachinery; and how our wealth had increased to an equally marvellous\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that various estimates which had been made of the\r\nincrease in our wealth-producing capacity showed that, roughly speaking,\r\nthe use of mechanical power had increased it more than a hundredfold\r\nduring the century; yet the result had been to create a limited upper\r\nclass, living in unexampled luxury, while about one-fourth of the whole\r\npopulation existed in a state of fluctuating penury, often sinking below\r\nthe margin of poverty. Many thousands were annually drawn into this gulf\r\nof destitution, and died from direct starvation and premature exhaustion\r\nor from diseases produced by unhealthy employment.\r\n\r\nDuring this long period, however, although wealth and want had alike\r\nincreased side by side, public opinion had not been sufficiently\r\neducated to permit of any effectual remedy being applied. The workers\r\nthemselves had failed to visualise its fundamental causes, land monopoly\r\nand the competitive system of industry giving rise to an ever-increasing\r\nprivate capitalism which, to a very large extent, had controlled the\r\nLegislature. All through the last century this rapid accumulation of\r\nwealth due to extensive manufacturing industries led to a still greater\r\nincrease of middlemen engaged in the distribution of the products, from\r\nthe wealthy merchant to the various grades of tradesmen and small\r\nshop-keepers who supplied the daily wants of the community.\r\n\r\nTo those who lived in the midst of this vast industrial system, or were\r\na part of it, it seemed natural and inevitable that there should be rich\r\nand poor; and this belief was enforced on the one hand by the clergy,\r\nand on the other by political economists, so that religion and science\r\nagreed in upholding the competitive and capitalistic system of society\r\nas the only rational and possible one. Hence it came to be believed that\r\nthe true sphere of governmental action did not include the abolition of\r\npoverty. It was even declared that poverty was due to economic causes\r\nover which governments had no power; that wages were kept down by the\r\n\"iron law\" of supply and demand; and that any attempt to find a remedy\r\nby Acts of Parliament only aggravated the disease. During the\r\nPremiership of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman this attitude was, for the\r\nfirst time, changed. On numerous occasions Sir Henry declared that he\r\nheld it to be the duty of a government to deal with problems of\r\nunemployment and poverty.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 three great strikes, coming in rapid succession--those of the\r\nRailway and other Transport Unions, the Miners, and the London Dock\r\nLabourers--brought home to the middle and upper classes, and to the\r\nGovernment, how completely all are dependent on the \"working classes.\"\r\nThis and similar experiences showed us that when the organisation of\r\nthe trade unions was more complete, and the accumulated funds of several\r\nyears were devoted to this purpose, the bulk of the inhabitants of\r\nLondon, and of other great cities, could be made to suffer a degree of\r\nfamine comparable with that of Paris when besieged by the German army in\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nWallace's watchword throughout these social agitations was \"Equality of\r\nOpportunity for All,\" and the ideal method by which he hoped to achieve\r\nthis end was a system of industrial colonisation in our own country\r\nwhereby _all_ would have a fair, if not an absolutely equal, share in\r\nthe benefits arising from the production of their own labour, whether\r\nphysical or mental.[50]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the education of the people, especially as a\r\nstepping-stone to moral and intellectual reform, Wallace believed in the\r\ntraining of individual natural talent, rather than the present system of\r\ngeneral education thrust upon every boy or girl regardless of their\r\nvarying mental capacities. He also urged that the building-up of the\r\nmind should be alternated with physical training in one or more useful\r\ntrades, so that there might be, not only at the outset, but also in\r\nlater life, a choice of occupation in order to avoid the excess of\r\nunemployment in any one direction.\r\n\r\nIn his opinion, one of the injurious results of our competitive system,\r\nhaving its roots, however, in the valuable \"guilds\" of a past epoch, was\r\nthe almost universal restriction of our workers to only one kind of\r\nlabour. The result was a dreadful monotony in almost all spheres of\r\nwork, the extreme unhealthiness of many, and a much larger amount of\r\nunemployment than if each man or woman were regularly trained in two or\r\nmore occupations. In addition to two of what are commonly called trades,\r\nevery youth should be trained for one day a week or one week in a\r\nmonth, according to the demand for labour, in some of the various\r\noperations of farming or gardening. Not only would this improve the\r\ngeneral health of the workers, but it would also add much to the\r\ninterest and enjoyment of their lives.\r\n\r\n\"There is one point,\" he wrote, \"in connection with this problem which I\r\ndo not think has ever been much considered or discussed. It is the\r\nundoubted benefit to all the members of a society of _the greatest\r\npossible diversity of character_, as a means both towards the greatest\r\nenjoyment and interest of association, and to the highest ultimate\r\ndevelopment of the race. If we are to suppose that man might have been\r\ncreated or developed with none of those extremes of character which now\r\noften result in what we call wickedness, vice, or crime, there would\r\ncertainly have been a greater monotony in human nature, which would,\r\nperhaps, have led to less beneficial results than the variety which\r\nactually exists may lead to. We are more and more getting to see that\r\nvery much, perhaps all, the vice, crime, and misery that exists in the\r\nworld is the result, not of the wickedness of individuals, but of the\r\nentire absence of sympathetic training from infancy onwards. So far as I\r\nhave heard, the only example of the effects of such a training on a\r\nlarge scale was that initiated by Robert Owen at New Lanark, which, with\r\nmost unpromising materials, produced such marvellous results on the\r\ncharacter and conduct of the children as to seem almost incredible to\r\nthe numerous persons who came to see and often critically to examine\r\nthem. There must have been all kinds of characters in his schools, yet\r\n_none_ were found to be incorrigible, _none_ beyond control, _none_ who\r\ndid not respond to the love and sympathetic instruction of their\r\nteachers. It is therefore quite possible that _all_ the evil in the\r\nworld is directly due to man, not to God, and that when we once realise\r\nthis to its full extent we shall be able, not only to eliminate almost\r\ncompletely what we now term evil, but shall then clearly perceive that\r\nall those propensities and passions that under bad conditions of society\r\ninevitably led to it, will under good conditions add to the variety and\r\nthe capacities of human nature, the enjoyment of life by all, and at the\r\nsame time greatly increase the possibilities of development of the whole\r\nrace. I myself feel confident that this is really the case, and that\r\nsuch considerations, when followed out to their ultimate issues, afford\r\na complete solution of the great problem of the ages--the origin of\r\nevil.\"[51]\r\n\r\nClosely allied with the welfare of the child is another \"reform\" with\r\nwhich Wallace's name will long be associated. That is his strong\r\ndenunciation of Vaccination. For seven years he laboured to show medical\r\nand scientific men that statistics proved beyond doubt the futility of\r\nthis measure to prevent disease. A few were converted, but public\r\nopinion is hard to move.\r\n\r\nIn his ideal of the future, Dr. Wallace gave a large and honoured sphere\r\nto women. He considered that it was in the highest degree presumptuous\r\nand irrational to attempt to deal by compulsory enactments with the most\r\nvital and most sacred of all human relationships, regardless of the fact\r\nthat our present phase of social development is not only extremely\r\nimperfect, but, as already shown, vicious and rotten to the core. How\r\ncould it be possible to determine by legislation those relations of the\r\nsexes which shall be best alike for individuals and for the race in a\r\nsociety in which a large proportion of our women are forced to work long\r\nhours daily for the barest subsistence, with an almost total absence of\r\nthe rational pleasures of life, for the want of which thousands are\r\ndriven into uncongenial marriages in order to secure some amount of\r\npersonal independence or physical well-being. He believed that when men\r\nand women are, for the first time in the course of civilisation, equally\r\nfree to follow their best impulses; when idleness and vicious and\r\nhurtful luxury on the one hand, and oppressive labour and the dread of\r\nstarvation on the other, are alike unknown; when _all_ receive the best\r\nand broadest education that the state of civilisation and knowledge will\r\nadmit; when the standard of public opinion is set by the wisest and the\r\nbest among us, and that standard is systematically inculcated in the\r\nyoung--then we shall find that a system of truly \"Natural Selection\" (a\r\nterm that Wallace preferred to \"Eugenics,\" which he utterly disliked)\r\nwill come spontaneously into action which will tend steadily to\r\neliminate the lower, the less developed, or in any way defective types\r\nof men, and will thus continuously raise the physical, moral, and\r\nintellectual standard of the race.\r\n\r\nHe further held that \"although many women now remain unmarried from\r\nnecessity rather than from choice, there are always considerable numbers\r\nwho feel no strong impulse to marriage, and accept husbands to secure\r\nsubsistence and a home of their own rather than from personal affection\r\nor sexual emotion. In a state of society in which all women were\r\neconomically independent, where all were fully occupied with public\r\nduties and social or intellectual pleasures, and had nothing to gain by\r\nmarriage as regards material well-being or social position, it is highly\r\nprobable that the numbers of unmarried from choice would increase. It\r\nwould probably come to be considered a degradation for any woman to\r\nmarry a man whom she could not love and esteem, and this reason would\r\ntend at least to delay marriage till a worthy and sympathetic partner\r\nwas encountered.\" But this choice, he considered, would be further\r\nstrengthened by the fact that, with the ever-increasing approach to\r\nequality of opportunity for every child born in our country, that\r\nterrible excess of male deaths, in boyhood and early manhood especially,\r\ndue to various preventable causes, would disappear, and change the\r\npresent majority of women to a majority of men. This would lead to a\r\ngreater rivalry for wives, and give to women the power of rejecting all\r\nthe lower types of character among their suitors.\r\n\r\n\"It will be their special duty so to mould public opinion, through home\r\ntraining and social influence, as to render the women of the future the\r\nregenerators of the entire human race.\" He fully hoped and believed that\r\nthey would prove equal to the high and responsible position which, in\r\naccordance with natural laws, they will be called upon to fulfil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. D.A. Wilson, who visited him in 1912, writes:\r\n\r\nHe surprised me by saying he was a Socialist--one does not expect a man\r\nlike him to label himself in any way. It appeared to be unconscious\r\nmodesty, like a school-boy's, which made him willing to be labelled; but\r\nno label could describe him, and his mental sweep was unlimited.\r\nAlthough in his ninetieth year, he seemed to be in his prime. There was\r\nno sign of age but physical weakness, and you had to make an effort at\r\ntimes to remember even that. His eye kindled as he spoke, and more than\r\nonce he walked about and chuckled, like a schoolboy pleased.\r\n\r\nAn earnest expression like Carlyle's came over his countenance as he\r\nreprobated the selfish, wild-cat competition which made life harder and\r\nmore horrible to-day for a well-doing poor man in England than among the\r\nMalays or Burmese before they had any modern inventions. Co-operation\r\nwas the upward road for humanity. Men grew out of beasthood by it, and\r\nby it civilisation began. Forgetting it, men retrograded, subsiding\r\nswiftly, so that there were many individuals among us to-day who were in\r\nbody, mind, and character below the level of our barbarian ancestors or\r\ncontemporary \"savages,\" to say nothing of civilised Burmese or Malays.\r\nWhat he meant by Socialism can be seen from his books. Nothing in them\r\nsurprised me after our talk. His appreciation of Confucius, when I\r\nquoted some things of the Chinese sage's which confirmed what he was\r\nsaying, was emphatic, and that and many other things showed that\r\nSocialism to him implied the upward evolution of humanity. It was\r\nbecause of the degradation of men involved that he objected to letting\r\nindividuals grab the public property--earth, air and water. Monopolies,\r\nhe thought, should at once revert to the public, and we had an argument\r\nwhich showed that he had no objection to even artificial monopolies if\r\nthey were public property. He defended the old Dutch Government\r\nmonopolies of spices, and declared them better than to-day's free trade,\r\nwhen cultivation is exploited by men who always tended to be mere\r\nmoney-grabbers, selfish savages let loose. In answer I mentioned the\r\nabuses of officialdom, as seen by me from the inside in Burma, and he\r\nagreed that the mental and moral superiority of many kinds of Asiatics\r\nto the Europeans who want to boss them made detailed European\r\nadministration an absurdity. We should leave these peoples to develop in\r\ntheir own way. Having conquered Burma and India, he proceeded, the\r\nEnglish should take warning from history and restrict themselves to\r\nkeeping the peace, and protecting the countries they had taken. They\r\nshould give every province as much home rule as possible and as soon as\r\npossible, and study to avoid becoming parasites.--D.A.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may fittingly conclude this brief summary of Wallace's social views\r\nand ideals by citing his own reply to the question: \"Why am I a\r\nSocialist?\" \"I am a Socialist because I believe that the highest law for\r\nmankind is justice. I therefore take for my motto, 'Fiat Justitia, Ruat\r\nCoelum'; and my definition of Socialism is, 'The use, by everyone, of\r\nhis faculties for the common good, and the voluntary organisation of\r\nlabour for the equal benefit of all.' That is absolute social justice;\r\nthat is ideal Socialism. It is, therefore, the guiding star for all true\r\nsocial reform.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe corresponded with Miss Buckley not only on scientific but also on\r\npublic questions and social problems:\r\n\r\nTO MISS BUCKLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rosehill, Dorking.

It seems\r\nto me that before formulating the idea in a specific shape it is needful\r\nto generate a body of public opinion on the general issue, and that it\r\nmust be some time before there can be produced such recognition of the\r\ngeneral principle involved as is needful before definite plans can be\r\nset forth to any purpose....--Truly yours,\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER TO A.R.

July 6, 1881._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--I have already seen the work you name, \"Progress and\r\nPoverty,\" having had a copy, or rather two copies, sent me. I gathered\r\nfrom what little I glanced at that I should fundamentally disagree with\r\nthe writer, and have not read more.\r\n\r\nI demur entirely to the supposition, which is implied in the book, that\r\nby any possible social arrangements whatever the distress which humanity\r\nhas to suffer in the course of civilisation could have been prevented.\r\nThe whole process, with all its horrors and tyrannies, and slaveries,\r\nand wars, and abominations of all kinds, has been an inevitable one\r\naccompanying the survival and spread of the strongest, and the\r\nconsolidation of small tribes into large societies; and among other\r\nthings the lapse of land into private ownership has been, like the lapse\r\nof individuals into slavery, at one period of the process altogether\r\nindispensable. I do not in the least believe that from the primitive\r\nsystem of communistic ownership to a high and finished system of State\r\nownership, such as we may look for in the future, there could be any\r\ntransition without passing through such stages as we have seen and which\r\nexist now. Argument aside, however, I should be disinclined to commit\r\nmyself to any scheme of immediate action, which, as I have indicated to\r\nyou, I believe at present premature. For myself I feel that I have to\r\nconsider not only what I may do on special questions, but also how the\r\naction I take on special questions may affect my general influence; and\r\nI am disinclined to give more handles against me than are needful.\r\nAlready, as you will see by the enclosed circular, I am doing in the way\r\nof positive action more than may be altogether prudent.--Sincerely\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA.R.

It is\r\ntempting!... If I had the prospect of clearing £1,000 by a lecturing\r\ncampaign I would go, though it would require a great effort.... I did\r\nnot think it possible even to contemplate going so far again, but the\r\nchance of earning a lot of money which would enable me to clear off this\r\nhouse and leave something for my family must be seriously\r\nconsidered.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

I am quite in favour of a legal eight hours' day.\r\nOvertime need not be forbidden, but every man who works overtime should\r\nhave a legal claim to double wages for the extra hours. That would make\r\nit cheaper for the master to employ two sets of men working each eight\r\nhours when they had long jobs requiring them, while for the necessities\r\nof finishing contracts, etc., they could well afford to pay double for\r\nthe extra hours. \"It would make everything dearer!\" Of course it would!\r\nHow else can you produce a more equal distribution of wealth than by\r\nmaking the rich and idle pay more and the workers receive more? \"The\r\nworkers would have to pay more, too, for everything they bought!\" True\r\nagain, but what they paid more would not equal their extra earnings,\r\nbecause a large portion of the extra pay to the men will be paid by the\r\nrich, and only the remainder paid by the men themselves. The eight\r\nhours' day and double pay for overtime would not only employ thousands\r\nnow out of work, but would actually raise wages per hour and per day.\r\nThis is clear, because wages are kept down wholly by the surplus supply\r\nof labour in every trade. The moment the surplus is used up, or nearly\r\nso, by more men being required on account of shorter hours, competition\r\namong the men becomes less; among the employers, for men, more: hence\r\nnecessarily higher wages all round. As to the bogey of foreign\r\ncompetition, it is a bogey only. All the political economists agree that\r\nif wages are raised in all trades, it will not in the least affect our\r\npower to export goods as profitably as now. Look and see! And, secondly,\r\nthe eight hours' movement is an international one, and will affect all\r\nalike in the end.\r\n\r\nThere are some arguments for you!

So far as\r\nyour intensely interesting volume has compelled some very prejudiced\r\npeople to read your attack on modern delusions, it is a great gain,\r\nespecially to themselves. I have read your tract on \"Justice, not\r\nCharity,\" with great pleasure and approval. The moment Mr. Benjamin\r\nKidd invented the striking term of \"equality of opportunity\" I adopted\r\nit, and have often preached it in the pulpit and on the platform, just\r\nas you preach it in the tract before me. I fully agree that justice, not\r\ncharity, is the fundamental principle of social reform. There is\r\nsomething very contemptible in the spiteful way in which many newspapers\r\nand magistrates are trying to aggravate the difficulties of\r\nconscientious men who avail themselves of the conscience clause in the\r\nnew Vaccination Act. There is very much to be done yet before social\r\njustice is realised, but the astonishing manifesto of the Czar of\r\nRussia, which I have no doubt is a perfectly sincere one, is a\r\nrevelation of the extent to which social truth is leavening European\r\nsociety. Since I last wrote to you I have been elected President of the\r\nWesleyan Methodist Conference, which will give me a great deal of\r\nspecial work and special opportunities also, I am thankful to say, of\r\npropagating Social Christianity, which in fact, and to a great extent in\r\nform, is what you yourself are doing.--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nH. PRICE HUGHES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO ALFRED RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. May 11, 1900._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am not a vegetarian, but I believe in it as certain to be\r\nadopted in the future, and as essential to a higher social and moral\r\nstate of society. My reasons are:\r\n\r\n(1) That far less land is needed to supply vegetable than to supply\r\nanimal food.\r\n\r\n(2) That the business of a butcher is, and would be, repulsive to all\r\nrefined natures.\r\n\r\n(3) That with proper arrangements for variety and good cookery,\r\nvegetable food is better for health of body and mind.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN (LORD) MORLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset, October 20, 1900._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I look upon you as the one politician left to us, who, by his\r\nability and integrity, his eloquence and love of truth, his high\r\nstanding as a thinker and writer, and his openness of mind, is able to\r\nbecome the leader of the English people in their struggle for freedom\r\nagainst the monopolists of land, capital, and political power. I\r\ntherefore take the liberty of sending you herewith a book of mine\r\ncontaining a number of miscellaneous essays, a few of which, I venture\r\nto think, are worthy of your serious attention.\r\n\r\nSome time since you intimated in one of your speeches that, if the\r\nchoice for this country were between Imperialism and Socialism, you were\r\ninclined to consider the latter the less evil of the two. You added, I\r\nthink, your conviction that the dangers of Socialism to human character\r\nwere what most influenced you against it. I trust that my impression of\r\nwhat you said is substantially correct. Now I myself believe, after a\r\nstudy of the subject extending over twenty years, that this danger is\r\nnon-existent, and certainly does not in any way apply to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of Socialism, which is, simply, _the voluntary organisation\r\nof labour for the good of all_....--With great esteem, I am yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN (LORD) MORLEY TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_57 Elm Park Gardens, S.W. October 31, 1900._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--For some reason, though your letter is dated the 20th, it\r\nhas only reached me, along with the two volumes, to-day. I feel myself\r\ngreatly indebted to you for both. In older days I often mused upon a\r\npassage of yours in the \"Malay Archipelago\" contrasting the condition of\r\ncertain types of savage life with that of life in a modern industrial\r\ncity. And I shall gladly turn again to the subject in these pages, new\r\nto me, where you come to close quarters with the problem.\r\n\r\nBut my time and my mind are at present neither of them free for the\r\neffective consideration of this mighty case. Nor can I promise myself\r\nthe requisite leisure for at least several months to come. What I can do\r\nis to set your arguments a-simmering in my brain, and perhaps when the\r\ntime of liberation arrives I may be in a state to make something of it.\r\nI don't suppose that I shall be a convert, but I always remember J.S.\r\nMill's observation, after recapitulating the evils to be apprehended\r\nfrom Socialism, that he would face them in spite of all, if the only\r\nalternative to Socialism were our present state.--With sincere thanks\r\nand regard, believe me yours faithfully\r\n\r\nJOHN MORLEY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. C.G. STUART-MENTEITH\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. June 6, 1901._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have no time to discuss your letter[52] at any length. You\r\nseem to assume that we can say definitely who are the \"fit\" and who the\r\n\"unfit.\"\r\n\r\nI deny this, except in the most extreme cases.\r\n\r\nI believe that, even now, the race is mostly recruited by the _more\r\nfit_--that is the upper working classes and the lower middle classes.\r\n\r\nBoth the very rich and the very poor are probably--as classes--below\r\nthese. The former increase less rapidly through immorality and late\r\nmarriage; the latter through excessive infant mortality. If that is the\r\ncase, no legislative interference is needed, and would probably do harm.\r\n\r\nI see nothing in your letter which is really opposed to my\r\ncontention--that under rational social conditions the healthy instincts\r\nof men and women will solve the population problem far better than any\r\ntinkering interference either by law or by any other means.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meantime the condition of things is not so bad as you\r\nsuppose.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. SYDNEY COCKERELL\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Wimborne. January 15, 1906._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Cockerell,--I have now finished reading Kropotkin's Life with\r\nvery great interest, especially for the light it throws on the present\r\ncondition of Russia. It also brings out clearly some very fine aspects\r\nof the Russian character, and the horrible despotism to which they are\r\nstill subject, equivalent to that of the days of the Bastille and the\r\nsystem of _Lettres de cachet_ before the great Revolution in France. It\r\nseems to me probable that under happier conditions--perhaps in the not\r\ndistant future--Russia may become the most advanced instead of the most\r\nbackward in civilisation--a real leader among nations, not in war and\r\nconquest but in social reform.--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. J. HYDER (Of THE LAND NATIONALISATION SOCIETY)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Wimborne. May 13, 1907._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Hyder,--Although it is not safe to hallo before one is out of\r\nthe wood, I think I may congratulate the Society upon the prospect it\r\nnow has of obtaining the first-fruits of its persistent efforts, for a\r\nquarter of a century, to form an enlightened public opinion in favour of\r\nour views. If the Government adequately fulfils its promises, we shall\r\nhave, in the Bill for a fair valuation of land apart from improvements,\r\nas a basis of taxation and for purchase, and that giving local\r\nauthorities full powers to acquire land so valued, the first real and\r\ndefinite steps towards complete nationalisation....\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

October 10, 1907._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I told Mr. Button that I do not approve of the resolution you\r\nare going to move.[54]\r\n\r\nThe workers of England have themselves returned a large majority of\r\nordinary Liberals, including hundreds of capitalists, landowners,\r\nmanufacturers, and lawyers, with only a sprinkling of Radicals and\r\nSocialists. The Government--your own elected Government--is doing more\r\nfor the workers than any Liberal Government ever did before, yet you are\r\ngoing to pass what is practically a vote of censure on it for not being\r\na Radical, Labour, and Socialist Government!\r\n\r\nIf this Government attempted to do what you and I think ought to be\r\ndone, it would lose half its followers and be turned out, ignominiously,\r\ngiving the Tories another chance. That is foolish as well as\r\nunfair.--Yours truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO LORD AVEBURY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Wimborne. June 23, 1908._\r\n\r\nDear Lord Avebury,--  ... Allow me to wish every success to your Bill for\r\npreserving beautiful birds from destruction. To stop the import is the\r\nonly way--short of the still more drastic method of heavily fining\r\neveryone who wears feathers in public, with imprisonment for a second\r\noffence. But we are not yet ripe for that.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE. TO MR. E. SMEDLEY\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. December 25, 1910._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Smedley,--Thanks for your long and interesting letter.... Man\r\nis, and has been, horribly cruel, and it is indeed difficult to explain\r\nwhy. Yet that there is an explanation, and that it does lead to good in\r\nthe end, I believe. Praying is evidently useless, and should be, as it\r\nis almost always selfish--for _our_ benefit, or our _families_, or our\r\n_nation_.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED E. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. W.G. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Wimborne. August 20, 1911._\r\n\r\nMy dear Will,--  ... The railway strike surpasses the Parliament Bill in\r\nexcitement. On receipt of Friday's paper, I sat down and composed and\r\nsent off to Lloyd George a short but big letter, on large foolscap\r\npaper, urging him and Asquith, as the two strong men of the Government,\r\nto take over at once the management of the railways of the entire\r\ncountry, by Royal Proclamation--on the ground of mismanagement for\r\nseventy years, and having brought the country to the verge of starvation\r\nand civil war; to grant an amnesty to all strikers (except for acts of\r\nviolence), also grant all the men's demands for one year, and devote\r\nthat time to a deliberate and impartial inquiry and a complete scheme of\r\nreorganisation of the railways in the interest, first of the public,\r\nthen of the men of all grades, lastly of the share and bond owners, who\r\nwill become guaranteed public creditors.... It has been admitted and\r\nproved again and again, that the men are badly treated, that their\r\ngrievances are real--their very unanimity and standing by each other\r\nproves it. Their demands are most moderate; and the cost in extra wages\r\nwill be saved over and over in safety, regularity, economy of working,\r\nand public convenience. I have not had even an acknowledgment of receipt\r\nyet, but hope to in a day or two....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. H.M. HYNDMAN TO A.R.

March 14, 1912._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Everyone who knows anything of the record of modern science\r\nin this country recognises how very much we all owe to you. It was,\r\ntherefore, specially gratifying to me that you should be so kind as to\r\nwrite such a very encouraging letter on the occasion of my seventieth\r\nbirthday. I owe you sincere thanks for what you said, though I may\r\nhonestly feel that you overpraised what I have done. It has been an\r\nuphill fight, but I am lucky in being allowed to see through the smoke\r\nand dust of battle a vision of the promised land. The transformation\r\nfrom capitalism to socialism is going on slowly under our eyes.\r\n\r\nAgain thanking you and wishing you every good wish, believe me yours\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nH.M. HYNDMAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. M.J. MURPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. August 19, 1913._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I not only think but firmly believe that Lloyd George is\r\nworking for the good of the people, in all ways open to him. The wonder\r\nis that he can persuade Asquith and the Cabinet to let him go as far as\r\nhe does. No doubt he is obliged to do things he does not think the best\r\nabsolutely, but the best that are practicable. He does not profess to be\r\na Socialist, and he is not infallible, but he does the best he can,\r\nunder the conditions in which he finds himself. Socialists who condemn\r\nhim for not doing more are most unfair. They must know, if they think,\r\nthat if he tried to do much more towards Socialism he would break up the\r\nGovernment and let in the Tories.--Yours truly,\r\n\r\nA.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. A. WILTSHIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. September 14, 1913._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I wish you every success in your work for the amelioration of\r\nthe condition of the workers, through whose exertions it may be truly\r\nsaid we all live and move and have our being.\r\n\r\nYour motto is excellent. Above all things stick together.\r\n\r\nEqually important is it to declare as a fixed principle that wages are\r\nto be and must be continuously raised, never lowered. You have too much\r\narrears to make up--too many forces against you, to admit of their being\r\never lowered. Let future generations decide when that is necessary--if\r\never.\r\n\r\nThis is a principle worth enforcing by a general strike. Nothing less\r\nwill be effective--nothing less should be accepted; and you must let the\r\nGovernment know it, and insist that they adopt it.\r\n\r\nThe rise must always be towards uniformity of payment for all useful and\r\nproductive work.--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED E. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nSome Further Problems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Astronomy\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the varied subjects upon which Wallace wrote, none, perhaps, came\r\nwith greater freshness to the general reader than his books written when\r\nhe was nearly eighty upon the ancient science of astronomy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he would have said that the \"directive Mind and Purpose\" kept\r\nthese subjects back until the closing years of his life in order that he\r\nmight bring to bear upon them his wider knowledge of nature, enlightened\r\nby that spiritual perception which led him to link the heavens and the\r\nearth in one common bond of evolution, culminating in the development of\r\nmoral and spiritual intelligences.\r\n\r\n\"Man's Place in the Universe\" (1903) was in effect a prelude to \"The\r\nWorld of Life\" (1910). Wallace saw afterwards that one grew out of the\r\nother, as we find him frequently saying with regard to his other books\r\nand essays.\r\n\r\nAs with Spiritualism, so with Astronomy, the seed-interest practically\r\nlay dormant in his mind for many years; with this difference, however,\r\nthat temperament and training caused a speedy unfolding of his mind when\r\nonce a scientific subject gripped him, whereas with Spiritualism he felt\r\nthe need of moving slowly and cautiously before fully accepting the\r\nphenomena as verifiable facts.\r\n\r\nIt was during the later period of his land-surveying, when he was\r\nsomewhere between the ages of 18 and 20, that he became distinctly\r\ninterested in the stars. Being left much alone at this period, he began\r\nto vary his pursuits by studying a book on Nautical Astronomy, and\r\nconstructing a rude telescope.[55] This primitive appliance increased\r\nhis interest in other astronomical instruments, and especially in the\r\ngrand onward march of astronomical discovery, which he looked upon as\r\none of the wonders of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt was the inclusion of astronomy in lectures he delivered at Davos\r\nwhich led him to extend his original brief notes into the four chapters\r\nwhich form an important part of his \"Wonderful Century.\" He freely\r\nconfessed that in order to write these chapters he was obliged to read\r\nwidely, and to make much use of friends to whom astronomy was a more\r\nfamiliar study. And it was whilst he was engaged upon these chapters\r\nthat his attention became riveted upon the unique position of our planet\r\nin relation to the solar system.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed that certain definite conditions appeared to be\r\nabsolutely essential to the origin and development of the higher types\r\nof terrestrial life, and that most of these must have been certainly\r\ndependent on a very delicate balance of the forces concerned in the\r\nevolution of our planet. Our position in the solar system appeared to\r\nhim to be peculiar and unique because, he thought, we may be almost sure\r\nthat these conditions do not coexist on any other planet, and that we\r\nhave no good reason to believe that other planets could have maintained\r\nover a period of millions of years the complex and equable conditions\r\nabsolutely necessary to the existence of the higher forms of terrestrial\r\nlife. Therefore it appeared to him to be proved that our earth does\r\nreally stand alone in the solar system by reason of its special\r\nadaptation for the development of human life.\r\n\r\nGranting this, however, the question might still be asked, Why should\r\nnot any one of the suns in other parts of space possess planets as well\r\nadapted as our own to develop the higher forms of organic life? These\r\nquestions cannot be answered definitely; but there are reasons, he\r\nconsidered, why the central position which we occupy may alone be\r\nsuitable. It is almost certain that electricity and other mysterious\r\nradiant forces (of which we have so recently discovered the existence)\r\nhave played an important part in the origin and development of organised\r\nlife, and it does not appear to be extravagant to assume that the\r\nextraordinary way in which these cosmic forces have remained hidden from\r\nus may be due to that central position which we are found to occupy in\r\nthe whole universe of matter discoverable by us. Indeed, it may well be\r\nthat these wonderful forces of the ether are more irregular--and perhaps\r\nmore violent--in their effect upon matter in what may be termed the\r\nouter chambers of that universe, and that they are only so nicely\r\nbalanced, so uniform in their action, and so concealed from us, as to be\r\nfit to aid in the development of organic life in that central portion of\r\nthe stellar system which our globe occupies. Should these views as to\r\nthe unique central position of our earth be supported by the results of\r\nfurther research, it will certainly rank as the most extraordinary and\r\nperhaps the most important of the many discoveries of the past century.\r\n\r\nWhile still working on this section of his \"Wonderful Century,\" he was\r\nasked to write a scientific article, upon any subject of his own choice,\r\nfor the _New York Independent_. And as the idea of the unique position\r\nof the earth to be the abode of human life was fresh in his mind, he\r\nthought it would prove interesting to the general public. However,\r\nbefore his article appeared simultaneously in the American papers and in\r\nthe _Fortnightly Review_, a friend who read it was so impressed with\r\nits originality and treatment that he persuaded Wallace to enlarge it\r\ninto book form; and it appeared in the autumn of 1903 as \"Man's Place in\r\nthe Universe.\"\r\n\r\nThis fascinating treatise upon the position occupied by the earth, and\r\nman, in the universe, had the same effect as some of his former\r\nwritings, of drawing forth unstinted commendation from many religious\r\nand secular papers; whilst the severely scientific and materialistic\r\nreviewers doubted how far his imagination had superseded unbiased\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nOn one point, however, most outsiders were in agreement--that he had\r\ninvested an ancient subject with freshest interest through approaching\r\nit by an entirely new way. The plan followed was that of bringing\r\ntogether all the positive conclusions of the astronomer, the geologist,\r\nthe physicist, and the biologist, and by weighing these carefully in the\r\nbalance he arrived at what appeared to him to be the only reasonable\r\nconclusion. He therefore set out to solve the problem whether or not the\r\nlogical inferences to be drawn from the various results of modern\r\nscience lent support to the view that our earth is the only inhabited\r\nplanet, not only in our own solar system, but in the whole stellar\r\nuniverse. In the course of his close and careful exposition he takes the\r\nreader through the whole trend of modern scientific research, concluding\r\nwith a summing-up of his deductions in the following six propositions,\r\nin the first three of which he sets out the conclusions reached by\r\nmodern astronomers:\r\n\r\n(1) That the stellar universe forms one connected whole; and, though of\r\nenormous extent, is yet finite, and its extent determinable.\r\n\r\n(2) That the solar system is situated in the plane of the Milky Way, and\r\nnot far removed from the centre of that plane. The earth is, therefore,\r\nnearly in the centre of the stellar universe.\r\n\r\n(3) That this universe consists throughout of the same kinds of matter,\r\nand is subjected to the same physical and chemical laws.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions which I claim to have shown to have enormous\r\nprobabilities in their favour are:\r\n\r\n(4) That no other planet in the solar system than our earth is inhabited\r\nor habitable.\r\n\r\n(5) That the probabilities are almost as great against any other sun\r\npossessing inhabited planets.\r\n\r\n(6) That the nearly central position of our sun is probably a permanent\r\none, and has been specially favourable, perhaps absolutely essential, to\r\nlife-development on the earth.\r\n\r\nWallace never maintained that this earth alone in the whole universe is\r\nthe abode of life. What he maintained was, first, that our solar system\r\nappears to be in or near the centre of the visible universe, and,\r\nsecondly, that all the available evidence supports the idea of the\r\nextreme unlikelihood of there being on any star or planet revealed by\r\nthe telescope any intelligent life either identical with or analogous to\r\nman. To suppose that this one particular type of universe extends over\r\nall space was, he considered, to have a low idea of the Creator and His\r\npower. Such a scheme would mean monotony instead of infinite variety,\r\nthe keynote of things as they are known to us. There might be a million\r\nuniverses, but all different.\r\n\r\nTo his mind there was no difficulty in believing in the existence of\r\nconsciousness apart from material organism; though he could not readily\r\nconceive of pure mind, or pure spirit, apart from some kind of\r\nsubstantial envelope or substratum. Many of the views suggested in\r\n\"Man's Place in the Universe\" as to man's spiritual progress hereafter,\r\nthe reason or ultimate purpose for which he was brought into existence,\r\nwere enlarged upon, later, in \"The World of Life.\" As early, however, as\r\n1903, Wallace did not hesitate to express his own firm conviction that\r\nScience and Spiritualism were in many ways closely akin.\r\n\r\nHe believed that the near future would show the strong tendency of\r\nscientists to become more religious or spiritual. The process, he\r\nthought, would be slow, as the general attitude has never been more\r\nmaterialistic than now. A few have been bold enough to assert their\r\nbelief in some outside power, but the leading scientific men are, as a\r\nrule, dead against them. \"They seem,\" he once remarked, \"to think, and\r\nto like to think, that the whole phenomena of life will one day be\r\nreduced to terms of matter and motion, and that every vegetable, animal,\r\nand human product will be explained, and may some day be artificially\r\nproduced, by chemical action. But even if this were so, behind it all\r\nthere would still remain an unexplained mystery.\"\r\n\r\nClosely associated with \"Man's Place in the Universe\" is a small volume,\r\n\"Is Mars Habitable?\" This was first commenced as a review of Professor\r\nPercival Lowell's book, \"Mars and its Canals,\" with the object of\r\nshowing that the large amount of new and interesting facts contained in\r\nthis work did not invalidate the conclusion that he (Wallace) had\r\nreached in 1903--that Mars is not habitable. The conclusions to which\r\nhis argument led him were these:\r\n\r\n(1) All physicists are agreed that  ... Mars would have a mean\r\ntemperature of about 35° F. owing to its distance from the sun.\r\n\r\n(2) But the very low temperatures on the earth under the equator at a\r\nheight where the barometer stands at about three times as high as on\r\nMars, proves that from scantiness of atmosphere alone Mars cannot\r\npossibly have a temperature as high as the freezing-point of water. The\r\ncombination of these two results must bring down the temperature of Mars\r\nto a degree wholly incompatible with the existence of animal life.\r\n\r\n(3) The quite independent proof that water-vapour cannot exist on Mars,\r\nand that, therefore, the first essential of organic life--water--is\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion from these three independent proofs  ... is therefore\r\nirresistible--that animal life, especially in its highest forms, cannot\r\nexist.

Had it not been for this touch of romance and\r\nidealism in his writings on astronomy, they would have lost much of\r\ntheir charm for the general reader. His breadth of vision transforms him\r\nfrom a mere student of astronomy into a seer who became ever more deeply\r\nconscious of the mystery both \"before and behind.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows;\r\n  Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?\r\n  From the great deep to the great deep he goes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd whilst facing with brave and steady mind the great mysteries of\r\nearth and sky, of life and what lies beyond it, he himself loved to\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n  \"Fear not thou the hidden purpose\r\n     Of that Power which alone is great,\r\n   Nor the myriad world His shadow,\r\n     Nor the silent Opener of the Gate.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the scientific friends to whom he appealed for help when writing\r\nhis astronomical books was Prof. (now Sir) W.F. Barrett.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. BARRETT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. February 12, 1901._\r\n\r\nMy dear Barrett,--I shall be much obliged if you will give me your\r\nopinion on a problem in physics that I cannot find answered in any book.\r\nIt relates to the old Nebular Hypothesis, and is this:\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the matter of the solar system was once wholly\r\ngaseous, and extended as a roughly globular or lenticular mass beyond\r\nthe orbit of Neptune. Sir Robert Ball stated in a lecture here that even\r\nwhen the solar nebula had shrunk to the size of the earth's orbit it\r\nmust have been (I think he said) hundreds of times rarer than the\r\nresidual gas in one of Crookes's high vacuum tubes. Yet, by hypothesis,\r\nit was hot enough, even in its outer portions, to retain all the solid\r\nelements in the gaseous state.\r\n\r\nNow, admitting this to be _possible_ at any given epoch, my difficulty\r\nis this: how long could the outer parts of this nebula exist, exposed to\r\nthe zero temperature of surrounding space, without losing the gaseous\r\nstate and aggregating into minute solid particles--into meteoric dust,\r\nin fact?\r\n\r\nCould it exist an hour? a day? a year? a century? Yet the process of\r\ncondensation from the Neptunian era to that of Saturn or Jupiter must\r\nsurely have occupied millions of centuries. What kept the almost\r\ninfinitely rare metallic gases in the gaseous state all this time? Is\r\nsuch a condition of things physically possible?\r\n\r\nI cannot myself imagine any such condition of things as the supposed\r\nprimitive solar nebula as possibly coming into existence under any\r\nconceivably antecedent conditions, but, granted that it did come into\r\nexistence, it seems to me that the gaseous state must almost instantly\r\nbegin changing into the solid state. Hence I adopt the meteoric theory\r\ninstead of the nebular; since all the evidence is in favour of solid\r\nmatter being abundant all through known space, while there is no\r\nevidence of metallic gases existing in space, except as the result of\r\ncollisions of huge masses of matter. Is my difficulty a mare's\r\nnest?--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO Mrs. Fisher\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Wimborne. February 28, 1905._\r\n\r\nDear Mrs. Fisher,--Thanks for your letter. Am sorry I have not converted\r\nyou, but perhaps it will come yet! I will only make one remark as to\r\nyour conclusion.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to prove a negative! That is not necessary. What I\r\nclaim to have done is, to have shown that all the evidence we have, be\r\nit much or little, is decidedly against not only other solar planets\r\nhaving inhabitants, but also, as far as probabilities are concerned,\r\nequally against it in any supposed stellar planets--for not one has been\r\nproved to exist. There is absolutely no evidence which shows even a\r\nprobability of there being other inhabited worlds. It is all pure\r\nspeculation, depending upon our ideas as to what the universe is for, as\r\nto what _we_ think (some of us!) _ought_ to be! That is not evidence,\r\neven of the flimsiest. All I maintain is that mine _is_ evidence,\r\nfounded on physical probabilities, and that, as against no evidence at\r\nall--no proved physical probability--mine holds the field!--Yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. E. SMEDLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Dorset. July 24, 1907._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Smedley,--  ... I write chiefly to tell you that I have read Mr.\r\nLowell's last book, \"Mars and its Canals,\" and am now writing an\r\narticle, or perhaps a small book, about it. I am sure his theories are\r\nall wrong, and I am showing why, so that anyone can see his fallacies.\r\nHis observations, drawings, photographs, etc., are all quite right, and\r\nI believe true to nature, but his interpretation of what he sees is\r\nwrong--often even to absurdity. He began by thinking the straight lines\r\nare works of art, and as he finds more and more of these straight lines,\r\nhe thinks that proves more completely that they are works of art, and\r\nthen he twists all other evidence to suit that. The book is not very\r\nwell written, but no doubt the newspaper men think that as he is such a\r\ngreat astronomer he must know what it all means!\r\n\r\nI am more than ever convinced that Mars is totally\r\nuninhabitable....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. BARRETT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Wimborne.

I have come to the sad conclusion that it is hopeless to get\r\nany mathematician to trouble himself to track out Lowell's obscurities\r\nand fallacies.... So, being driven on to my own resources, I have worked\r\nout a mode of estimating (within limits) the temperature of Mars,\r\nwithout any mathematical formulæ--and only a little arithmetic. I want\r\nto know if there is any fallacy in it, and therefore take the liberty of\r\nsending it to you, as you are taking your holiday, just to read it over\r\nand tell me if you see any flaw in it. I also send my short summary of\r\nLowell's _Philosophical Magazine_ paper, so that you can see if my\r\ncriticism at the end is fair, and whether his words really mean what to\r\nme they seem to....--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. F. BIRCH\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sept. 12, 1907._\r\n\r\nDear Fred,--  ... For the last two or three months I have had a hard\r\nstruggle with Mars--not the god of war, but the planet--writing a small\r\nbook, chiefly criticising Lowell's last book, called \"Mars and its\r\nCanals,\" published less than a year back by Macmillan, who will also\r\npublish my reply. _I_ think it is crushing, but it has cost me a deal of\r\ntrouble, as Lowell has also printed a long and complex mathematical\r\narticle trying to prove that though Mars receives less than half the\r\nsun-heat we do, yet it is very nearly as warm and quite habitable! But\r\nhis figures and arguments are alike so shaky and involved that I cannot\r\nget any of my mathematical friends to tackle it or point out his errors.\r\nHowever, I think I have done it myself by the rules of common\r\nsense....--Your sincere friend,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

December 2, 1910._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your \"monistic\" system is to me a system of mere\r\ncontradictory words. You begin with three things--then you say they are\r\ncorrelated with one substance--coextensive with the universe. This you\r\ncannot possibly know, and it is about as intelligible and as likely to\r\nbe true as the Athanasian Creed!--Yours truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

But my two works, \"Man's Place in the\r\nUniverse\" (now published at 1s.), and my later volume, \"The World of\r\nLife,\" form together a very elaborate, and I think conclusive,\r\nscientific argument in favour of the view that the whole material\r\nuniverse exists and is designed for the production of immortal spirits,\r\nin the greatest possible diversity of nature, and character,\r\ncorresponding with  ... the almost infinite diversity of that universe,\r\nin all its parts and in every detail....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

October 9, 1913._\r\n\r\nDear Sir Oliver Lodge,--Owing to ill-health and other causes I have only\r\nnow been able to finish the perusal of your intensely interesting and\r\ninstructive Address to the British Association. I cannot, however,\r\nrefrain from writing to you to express my admiration of it, and\r\nespecially of the first half of it, in which you discuss the almost\r\ninfinite variety and complexity of the physical problems involved in the\r\ngreat principle of \"continuity\" in so clear a manner that outsiders like\r\nmyself are able to some extent to apprehend them. I am especially\r\npleased to find that you uphold the actual existence and _continuity_ of\r\nthe ether as scientifically established, and reject the doubts of some\r\nmathematicians as to the reality and perfect continuity of space and\r\ntime as unthinkable.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the Address is even more important, and is especially\r\nnotable for your clear and positive statements as to the evidence in all\r\nlife-process of a \"guiding\" Mind. I can hardly suppose that you can have\r\nfound time to read my rather discursive and laboured volume on \"The\r\nWorld of Life,\" written mainly for the purpose of enforcing not only the\r\nproofs of a \"guiding\" but also of a \"foreseeing\" and \"designing\" Mind by\r\nevidence which will be thought by most men of science to be unduly\r\nstrained. It is, therefore, the more interesting to me to find that you\r\nhave yourself (on pp. 33-34 of your Address) used the very same form of\r\nanalogical illustration as I have done (at p. 296 of \"The World of\r\nLife\") under the heading of \"A Physiological Allegory,\" as being a very\r\nclose representation of what really occurs in nature.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: your last paragraph rises to a height of grandeur and\r\neloquence to which I cannot attain, but which excites my highest\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nShould you have a separate copy to spare of your Romanes Lecture at\r\nOxford, I should be glad to have it to refer to.--Believe me yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last of Wallace's letters on astronomical subjects was written to\r\nSir Oliver Lodge about a week before his death:\r\n\r\nTO SIR OLIVER LODGES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. October 27, 1913._\r\n\r\nDear Sir Oliver Lodge,--Many thanks for your Romanes Lecture, which,\r\nowing to my ignorance of modern electrical theory and experiments, is\r\nmore difficult for me than was your British Association Address.\r\n\r\nI have been very much interested the last month by reading a book sent\r\nme from America by Mr. W.L. Webb, being \"An Account of the Unparalleled\r\nDiscoveries of Mr. T.J.J. See.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of Mr. See's own lectures are given, with references to his\r\n\"Researches on the Evolution of the Stellar Systems,\" in two large\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nHis theory of \"capture\" of suns, planets, and satellites seems to me\r\nvery beautifully worked out under the influence of gravitation and a\r\nresisting medium of cosmical dust--which explains the origin and motions\r\nof the moon as well as that of all the planets and satellites far better\r\nthan Sir G. Darwin's expulsion theory.\r\n\r\nI note however that he is quite ignorant that Proctor, forty years ago,\r\ngave full reasons for this \"capture\" theory in his \"Expanse of Heaven,\"\r\nand also that the same writer showed that the Milky Way could not have\r\nthe enormous lateral extension he gives to it, but that it cannot really\r\nbe much flattened. He does not even mention the proofs given of this\r\nboth by Proctor and, I think, by Herbert Spencer, while in Mr. Webb's\r\nvolume (opposite p. 212) is a diagram showing the \"Coal Sack\" as a\r\n\"vacant lane\" running quite through and across the successive spiral\r\nextensions laterally of the galaxy, without any reference or a word of\r\nexplanation that such features, of which there are many, really\r\ndemonstrate the untenability of such extension.\r\n\r\nAn even more original and extremely interesting part of Mr. See's work\r\nis his very satisfactory solution of the hitherto unsolved geological\r\nproblem of the origin of all the great mountain ranges of the world, in\r\nChapters X., XI., and XII. of Mr. Webb's volume. It seems quite complete\r\nexcept for the beginnings, but I suppose it is a result of the formation\r\nof the _earth_ by accretion and not by expulsion, by heating and not by\r\ncooling....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Spiritualism\r\n\r\n    \"The completely materialistic mind of my youth and early manhood\r\n    has been slowly moulded into the socialistic, spiritualistic, and\r\n    theistic mind I now exhibit--a mind which is, as my scientific\r\n    friends think, so weak and credulous in its declining years, as to\r\n    believe that fruit and flowers, domestic animals, glorious birds\r\n    and insects, wool, cotton, sugar and rubber, metals and gems, were\r\n    all foreseen and foreordained for the education and enjoyment of\r\n    man. The whole cumulative argument of my 'World of Life' is that\r\n    _in its every detail_ it calls for the agency of a mind  ...\r\n    enormously above and beyond any human mind  ... Whether this\r\n    Unknown Reality is a single Being and acts everywhere in the\r\n    universe as direct creator, organiser, and director of every\r\n    minutest motion  ... or through 'infinite grades of beings,' as I\r\n    suggest, comes to much the same thing. Mine seems a more clear and\r\n    intelligible supposition  ... and it is the teaching of the Bible,\r\n    of Swedenborg, and of Milton.\"--Letter from A.R. Wallace to JAMES\r\n    MARCHANT, written in 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters on Spiritualism which Wallace wrote cast further light on\r\nthe personal attitude of mind which he maintained towards that subject.\r\nHe was an unbiased scientific investigator, commencing on the \"lower\r\nlevel\" of spirit phenomena, such as raps and similar physical\r\nmanifestations of \"force by unseen intelligences,\" and passing on to a\r\nclearer understanding of the phenomena of mesmerism and telepathy; to\r\nthe materialisation of, and conversation with, the spirits of those who\r\nhad been known in the body, until the conviction of life after death, as\r\nthe inevitable crowning conclusion to the long process of evolution, was\r\nreached in the remarkable chapter with which he concludes \"The World of\r\nLife\"--an impressive prose poem.\r\n\r\nLike that of many other children, Wallace's early childhood was spent in\r\nan orthodox religious atmosphere, which, whilst awakening within him\r\nvague emotions of religious fervour, derived chiefly from the more\r\npicturesque and impassioned of the hymns which he occasionally heard\r\nsung at a Nonconformist chapel, left no enduring impression. Moreover,\r\nat the age of 14 he was brought suddenly into close contact with\r\nSocialism as expounded by Robert Owen, which dispelled whatever\r\nglimmerings of the Christian faith there may have been latent in his\r\nmind, leaving him for many years a confirmed materialist.\r\n\r\nThis fact, together with his early-aroused sense of the social injustice\r\nand privations imposed upon the poorer classes both in town and country,\r\nwhich he carefully observed during his experience as a land-surveyor,\r\nmight easily have had an undesirable effect upon his general character\r\nhad not his intense love and reverence for nature provided a stimulus to\r\nhis moral and spiritual development. But the \"directive Mind and\r\nPurpose\" was preparing him silently and unconsciously until his \"fabric\r\nof thought\" was ready to receive spiritual impressions. For, according\r\nto his own theory, as \"the laws of nature bring about continuous\r\ndevelopment, on the whole progressive, one of the subsidiary results of\r\nthis mode of development is that no organ, no sensation, no faculty\r\narises _before_ it is needed, or in greater degree than it is\r\nneeded.\"[56] From this point of view we may make a brief outline of the\r\nmanner in which this particular \"faculty\" arose and was developed in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen at Leicester, in 1844, his curiosity was greatly excited by some\r\nlectures on mesmerism given by Mr. Spencer Hall, and he soon discovered\r\nthat he himself had considerable power in this direction, which he\r\nexercised on some of his pupils.\r\n\r\nLater, when his brother Herbert joined him in South America, he found\r\nthat he also possessed this gift, and on several occasions they\r\nmesmerised some of the natives for mere amusement. But the subject was\r\nput aside, and Wallace paid no further attention to such phenomena until\r\nafter his return to England in 1862.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the summer of 1865 that he witnessed any phenomena of a\r\nspiritualistic nature; of these a full account is given in \"Miracles and\r\nModern Spiritualism\" (p. 132). \"I came,\" he says, \"to the inquiry\r\nutterly unbiased by hopes or fears, because I knew that my belief could\r\nnot affect the reality, and with an ingrained prejudice even against\r\nsuch a word as 'spirit,' which I have hardly yet overcome.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time until 1895, when the second edition of that book\r\nappeared, he did much, together with other scientists, to establish\r\nthese facts, as he believed them to be, on a rational and scientific\r\nfoundation. It will also be noticed, both before and after this period,\r\nthat in addition to the notable book which he published dealing\r\nexclusively with these matters, the gradual trend of his convictions,\r\nadvancing steadily towards the end which he ultimately reached, had\r\nbecome so thoroughly woven into his \"fabric of thought\" that it appears\r\nunder many phases in his writings, and occupies a considerable part of\r\nhis correspondence, of which we have only room for some specimens.\r\n\r\nThe first definite statement of his belief in \"this something\" other\r\nthan material in the evolution of Man appeared in his essay on \"The\r\nDevelopment of Human Faces under the Law of Natural Selection\" (1864).\r\nIn this he suggested that, Man having reached a state of physical\r\nperfection through the progressive law of Natural Selection, thenceforth\r\nMind became the dominating factor, endowing Man with an ever-increasing\r\npower of intelligence which, whilst the physical had remained\r\nstationary, had continued to develop according to his needs. This\r\n\"in-breathing\" of a divine Spirit, or the controlling force of a supreme\r\ndirective Mind and Purpose, which was one of the points of divergence\r\nbetween his theory and that held by Darwin, is too well known to need\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\nThis disagreement has a twofold interest from the fact that Darwin, in\r\nhis youth, studied theology with the full intention of taking holy\r\norders, and for some years retained his faith in the more or less\r\northodox beliefs arising out of the Bible. But as time went by, an\r\never-extending knowledge of the mystery of the natural laws governing\r\nthe development of man and nature led him to make the characteristically\r\nfrank avowal that he \"found it more and more difficult  ... to invent\r\nevidence which would suffice to convince\"; adding, \"This disbelief crept\r\nover me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so\r\nslow that I felt no distress.\"[57] With Wallace, however, his early\r\ndisbelief ended in a deep conviction that \"as nothing in nature actually\r\n'dies,' but renews its life in another and higher form, so Man, the\r\nhighest product of natural laws here, must by the power of mind and\r\nintellect continue to develop hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nThe varied reasons leading up to this final conviction, as related by\r\nhimself in \"Miracles and Modern Spiritualism\" and \"My Life,\" are,\r\nhowever, too numerous and detailed to be retold in a brief summary in\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence that follows deals entirely with investigations on\r\nthis side of the Atlantic, but a good deal of evidence which to him was\r\nconclusive was obtained during his stay in America, where Spiritualism\r\nhas been more widely recognised, and for a much longer period than in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nSome of the letters addressed to Miss Buckley (afterwards Mrs. Fisher)\r\nreveal the extreme caution which he both practised himself and advocated\r\nin others when following up any experimental phase of spiritual\r\nphenomena. The same correspondence also gives a fairly clear outline of\r\nhis faith in the ascending scale from the physical evidence of\r\nspirit-existence to the communication of some actual knowledge of life\r\nas it exists beyond the veil.\r\n\r\nIn spiritual matters, as in natural science, though at times his head\r\nmay have appeared to be \"in the clouds,\" his feet were planted firmly on\r\nthe earth. This is seen, to note another curious instance, in his\r\ncorrespondence with Sir Wm. Barrett, where he maintains a delicate\r\nbalance between natural science and \"spirit impression\" when discussing\r\nthe much controverted reality of \"dowsing\" for water.\r\n\r\nIt was this breadth of vision, unhampered by mere intellectualism, but\r\nalways kept within reasonable bounds by scientific deduction and\r\nanalysis, which constituted Alfred Russel Wallace a seer of the first\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nWallace lived to see the theory of evolution applied to the life-history\r\nof the earth and the starry firmament, to the development of nations and\r\nraces, to the progress of mind, morals and religion, even to the origin\r\nof consciousness and life--a conception which has completely\r\nrevolutionised man's attitude towards himself and the world and God.\r\nEvolution became intelligible in the light of that idea which came to\r\nhim in his hut at Ternate and changed the face of the universe. Surely\r\nit was enough for any one man to be one of the two chief originators of\r\nsuch a far-reaching thought and to witness its impact upon the ancient\r\nstory of special creations which it finally laid in the dust. But\r\nWallace was privileged beyond all the men of his generation. He lived to\r\nsee many of the results of the theory of evolution tested by time and to\r\nforesee that there were definite limits to its range, that, indeed,\r\nthere were two lines of development--one affecting the visible world of\r\nform and colour and the other the invisible world of life and\r\nspirit--two worlds springing from two opposite poles of being and\r\ndeveloping _pari passu_, or, rather, the spiritual dominating the\r\nmaterial, life originating and controlling organisation. It was, in\r\nshort, his peculiar task to reveal something of the Why as well as the\r\nHow of the evolutionary process, and in doing so verily to bring\r\nimmortality to light.\r\n\r\nThe immediate exciting cause of this discovery of the inadequacy of\r\nevolution from the material side alone to account for the world of life\r\nmay seem to many to have been trivial and unworthy of the serious\r\nattention of a great scientist. How, it might be asked, could the crude\r\nand doubtful phenomena of Spiritualism afford reasonably adequate\r\ngrounds for challenging its supremacy and for setting a limit to its\r\nrange? But spiritualistic phenomena were only the accidental modes in\r\nwhich the other side of evolution struck in upon his vision. They set\r\nhim upon the other track and opened up to him the vaster kingdom of life\r\nwhich is without beginning, limit or end; in which perchance the\r\nsequence of life from the simple to the complex, from living germ to\r\nliving God, may also be the law of growth. It is in the light of this\r\nultimate end that we must judge the stumbling steps guided by raps and\r\nvisions which led him to the ladder set up to the stars by which\r\nconnection was established with the inner reality of being. That was the\r\ndistinctive contribution which he made to human beliefs over and above\r\nhis advocacy of pure Darwinism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReading almost everything he could obtain upon occult phenomena, Wallace\r\nfound that there was such a mass of testimony by men of the highest\r\ncharacter and ability in every department of human learning that he\r\nthought it would be useful to bring this together in a connected sketch\r\nof the whole subject. This he did, and sent it to a secularist magazine,\r\nin which it appeared in 1866, under the title of \"The Scientific Aspect\r\nof the Supernatural.\" He sent a copy to Huxley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO T.H.

It may be all true, for anything I know to the\r\ncontrary, but really I cannot get up any interest in the subject. I\r\nnever cared for gossip in my life, and disembodied gossip, such as these\r\nworthy ghosts supply their friends with, is not more interesting to me\r\nthan any other. As for investigating the matter, I have half-a-dozen\r\ninvestigations of infinitely greater interest to me to which any spare\r\ntime I may have will be devoted. I give it up for the same reason I\r\nabstain from chess--it's too amusing to be fair work, and too hard work\r\nto be amusing.--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO T.H. HUXLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n_9 St. Mark's Crescent, Regent's Park, N.W. December 1, 1866._\r\n\r\nDear Huxley,--Thanks for your note. Of course, I have no wish to press\r\non you an inquiry for which you have neither time nor inclination. As\r\nfor the \"gossip\" you speak of, I care for it as little as you can do,\r\nbut what I do feel an intense interest in is the exhibition of _force_\r\nwhere force has been declared _impossible_, and of _intelligence_ from a\r\nsource the very mention of which has been deemed an _absurdity_.\r\n\r\nFaraday has declared (apropos of this subject) that he who can prove the\r\nexistence or exertion of force, if but the lifting of a single ounce, by\r\na power not yet recognised by science, will deserve and assuredly\r\nreceive applause and gratitude. (I quote from memory the sense of his\r\nexpressions in his Lecture on Education.)\r\n\r\nI believe I can now show such a force, and I trust some of the\r\nphysicists may be found to admit its importance and examine into\r\nit.--Believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MISS BUCKLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Holly House, Barking, E. December 25, 1870._\r\n\r\nDear Miss Buckley,--  ... You did not hear Mrs. Hardinge[58] on very\r\nfavourable topics, and I hope you will hear her often again, and\r\nespecially hear one of her regular discourses. I think, however, from\r\nwhat you heard, that, setting aside all idea of her being more than a\r\nmere spiritualist lecturer setting forth the ideas and opinions of the\r\nsect, you will admit that spiritualists, as represented by her, are\r\nneither prejudiced nor unreasonable, and that they are truly imbued with\r\nthe scientific spirit of subordinating all theory to fact. You will also\r\nadmit, I think, that the moral teachings of Spiritualism, as far as she\r\ntouched upon them, are elevated and beautiful and calculated to do good;\r\nand if so, that is the use of Spiritualism--the getting such doctrines\r\nof future progress founded on actual phenomena which we can observe and\r\nexamine now, not on phenomena which are said to have occurred thousands\r\nof years ago and of which we have confessedly but imperfect records.\r\n\r\nI think, too, that the becoming acquainted with two such phases of\r\nSpiritualism as are exhibited by Mrs. Hardinge and Miss Houghton must\r\nshow you that the whole thing is not to be judged by the common\r\nphenomena of public stances alone, and I can assure you that there are\r\ndozens of other phases of the subject as remarkable as these\r\ntwo....--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

I have lately had a stance with the celebrated\r\nMr. Home, and saw that most wonderful phenomenon an accordion playing\r\nbeautiful music by itself, the bottom only being held in Mr. Home's\r\nhand. I was invited to watch it as closely as I pleased under the table\r\nin a well-lighted room. I am sure nothing touched it but Mr. Home's one\r\nhand, yet at one time I saw a shadowy yet defined hand on the keys. This\r\nis too vast a phenomenon for any sceptic to assimilate, and I can well\r\nunderstand the impossibility of their accepting the evidence of their\r\nown senses. Mr. Crookes, F.R.S., the chemist, was present and suspended\r\nthe table with a spring balance, when it was at request made heavy or\r\nlight, the indicator moving accordingly, and to prevent any mistake it\r\nwas made light when the hands of all present were resting on the table\r\nand heavy when our hands were all underneath it. The difference, if I\r\nremember, was about 40 lb. I was also asked to place a candle on the\r\nfloor and look under the table while it was lifted completely off the\r\nfloor, Mr. Home's feet being 2 ft. distant from any part of it. This was\r\nin a lady's house in the West End. Mr. Home courts examination if people\r\ncome to him in a fair and candid spirit of inquiry....--Yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

January 11, 1874._\r\n\r\nMy dear Miss Buckley,--I am delighted to hear of your success so far,\r\nand hope you are progressing satisfactorily. Pray keep accurate notes of\r\nall that takes place.... Allow me  ... to warn you not to take it for\r\ngranted till you get proof upon proof that it is really your sister that\r\nis communicating with you. I hope and think it is, but still, the\r\nconditions that render communication possible are so subtle and complex\r\nthat she may not be able; and some other being, reading your mind, may\r\nbe acting through you and making you think it is your sister, to induce\r\nyou to go on. Be therefore on the look out for characteristic traits of\r\nyour sister's mind and manner which are different from your own. These\r\nwill be tests, especially if they come when and how you are not\r\nexpecting them. Even if it is your sister, she may be obliged to use the\r\nintermediation of some other being, and in that case her peculiar\r\nidiosyncrasy may be at first disguised, but it will soon make itself\r\ndistinctly visible. Of course you will preserve every scrap you write,\r\nand date them, and they will, I have no doubt, explain each other as you\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\nIf you can get to see the last number of the _Quarterly Journal of\r\nScience_, you will find a most important article by Mr. Crookes, giving\r\nan outline of the results of his investigations, which he is going to\r\ngive in full in a volume. His facts are most marvellous and convincing,\r\nand appear to me to answer every one of the objections that have usually\r\nbeen made to the evidence adduced....--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

It will be\r\nsplendid if you really become a good medium for some first-rate\r\nunmistakable manifestations that even Huxley will acknowledge are worth\r\nseeing, and Carpenter confess are not to be explained by unconscious\r\ncerebration....--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

March 9, 1874._\r\n\r\nDear Miss Buckley,--I compassionate your mediumistic troubles, but I\r\nhave no doubt it will all come right in the end. The fact that your\r\nsister will not talk as you want her to talk--will not say what you\r\nexpect her to say, is a grand proof that it is not your unconscious\r\ncerebration that does her talking for her. Is not that clear? Whether it\r\nis she herself or someone else who is talking to you, is not so clear,\r\nbut that it is not you, I think, is clear enough.\r\n\r\nI can quite understand, too, that your sister in her new life may be,\r\nabove all things, interested in getting the telegraph in good order, to\r\ncommunicate, and will not think of much else till that is done. While\r\nthe first Atlantic cable was being laid the messages would be chiefly\r\nreports of progress, directions and instructions, with now and then\r\ntrivialities about the weather, the time, or small items of news. Only\r\nwhen it was in real working order was a President's Message, a Queen's\r\nSpeech, sent through it.\r\n\r\nAutomatic writing and trance speaking never yet convinced anybody. They\r\nare only useful for those who are already convinced. But you _would_\r\nbegin this way. You would not go to mediums and séances and see what you\r\ncould get that way. So now you must persevere; but do not give up your\r\nown judgment in anything. Insist upon having things explained to you, or\r\nsay you won't go on. You will then find they will be explained, only it\r\nmay take a little more time.... --Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

On coming home this evening I received the news\r\nof poor little Bertie's death--this morning at eight o'clock. I left him\r\nonly yesterday forenoon, and had then considerable hopes, for we had\r\njust commenced a new treatment which a fortnight earlier I am pretty\r\nsure might have saved him. The thought suddenly struck me to go to Dr.\r\nWilliams, of Hayward's Heath  ... but it was too late. As he had been in\r\nthis same state of exhaustion for nearly a month, it is evident that\r\nvery slight influences might have been injurious or beneficial. Our\r\northodox medical men are profoundly ignorant of the subtle influences of\r\nthe human body in health and disease, and can thus do nothing in many\r\ncases which Nature would cure if assisted by proper conditions. We who\r\nknow what strange and subtle influences are around us can believe\r\nthis....--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

FISHER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MISS BUCKLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dell, Grays, Essex. Thursday evening, [? December, 1875]._\r\n\r\nDear Miss Buckley,--Our stance came off last evening, and was a\r\ntolerable success. The medium is a very pretty little lively girl, the\r\nplace where she sits a bare empty cupboard formed by a frame and doors\r\nto close up a recess by the side of a fireplace in a small basement\r\nbreakfast-room. We examined it, and it is absolutely impossible to\r\nconceal a scrap of paper in it. Miss Cooke is locked in this cupboard,\r\nabove the door of which is a square opening about 15 inches each way,\r\nthe only thing she takes with her being a long piece of tape and a chair\r\nto sit on. After a few minutes Katie's whispering voice was heard, and a\r\nlittle while after we were asked to open the door and seal up the\r\nmedium. We found her hands tied together with the tape passed three\r\ntimes round each wrist and tightly knotted, the hands tied close\r\ntogether, the tape then passing behind and well knotted to the\r\nchair-back. We sealed all the knots with a private seal of my friend's,\r\nand again locked the door. A portable gas lamp was on a table the whole\r\nevening, shaded by a screen so as to cast a shadow on the square opening\r\nabove the door of the cupboard till permission was given to illuminate\r\nit. Every object and person in the room were always distinctly visible.\r\nA face[59] then appeared at the opening, but dark and indistinct.\r\n\r\nAfter a time another face quite distinct with a white turban-like\r\nheaddress--this was a handsome face with a considerable general likeness\r\nto that of the medium, but paler, larger, fuller, and older--decidedly a\r\ndifferent face, although like. The light was thrown full on this face,\r\nand on request it advanced so that the chin projected a little beyond\r\nthe aperture. We were then ordered to release the medium. I opened the\r\ndoor, and found her bent forward with her head in her lap, and\r\napparently in a deep sleep or trance--from which a touch and a few words\r\nawoke her. We then examined the tape and knots--all was as we left it\r\nand every seal perfect.\r\n\r\nThe same face appeared later in the evening, and also one decidedly\r\ndifferent with coarser features.\r\n\r\nAfter this, for the sake I believe of two sceptics present, the medium\r\nwas twice tied up in a way that no human being could possibly tie\r\nherself. Her wrists were tied together so tightly and painfully that it\r\nwas impossible to untie them in any moderate time, and she was also\r\nsecured to the chair; on the other occasion the two arms were tied close\r\nabove the elbows so tightly that the arms were swelling considerably\r\nfrom impeded circulation, the elbows being drawn together as close as\r\npossible behind the back, there repeatedly knotted, and again tightly\r\nknotted to the back of the chair. Miss C. was evidently in considerable\r\npain, and she had to be lifted out bodily in her chair before we could\r\nsafely cut her loose, so tightly was she bound. This evidently had a\r\ngreat effect on the sceptics, as I have no doubt it was intended to\r\nhave, and it demonstrated pretty clearly that some strange being was\r\ninside the cupboard playing these tricks, although quite invisible and\r\nintangible to us except when she made certain portions of herself\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss C. was complaining of being hurt by the tying we could hear\r\nthe whispering voice soothing her in the kindest manner, and also heard\r\nkisses, and Miss C. afterwards declared that she could feel hands and\r\nface about her like those of a real person.\r\n\r\nDuring all the face exhibitions singing had to go on to a rather painful\r\nextent.[60]\r\n\r\nA Dr. Purdon was present, an Army surgeon, who has been much in India,\r\nand seems a very intelligent man. He seemed very intimate with the\r\nfamily, and told us he had studied them all, and had had Miss Cooke a\r\nmonth at a time in his own house, studying these phenomena. He was\r\nabsolutely satisfied of their genuineness, and indeed no opportunity for\r\nimposture seems to exist.\r\n\r\nThe children of the house tell wonderful tales of how they are lifted up\r\nand carried about by the spirits. They seem to enjoy it very much, and\r\nto look upon it all as just as real and natural as any other matters of\r\ntheir daily life.\r\n\r\nCan such things be in this nineteenth century, and the wise ones pass\r\naway in utter ignorance of their existence?--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Glasgow Meeting of the British Association in 1876, Prof. (now\r\nSir) W.F. Barrett read a paper \"On some Phenomena associated with\r\nAbnormal Conditions of Mind.\" Wallace was Chairman of the Section in\r\nwhich the paper was read, and a vigorous controversy arose at the close\r\nbetween Dr. Carpenter, who came in towards the end of the paper, and the\r\nChairman. The paper set forth certain remarkable evidence which Prof.\r\nBarrett had obtained from a subject in the mesmeric trance, giving what\r\nappeared to be indubitable proof of some supernormal mode of\r\ntransmission of ideas from his mind to that of the subject. The facts\r\nwere so novel and startling that Prof. Barrett asked for a committee of\r\nexperts to examine the whole question and see whether such a thing as\r\n\"thought transference,\" independently of the recognised channels of\r\nsense, did really exist. This was the first time evidence of this kind\r\nhad been brought before a scientific society, and a protracted\r\ndiscussion followed. The paper also dealt with certain so-called\r\nspiritualistic phenomena, which at the time Prof. Barrett was disposed\r\nto attribute to hallucination and \"thought-transference.\" The\r\nintroduction of this topic led the discussion away from the substance of\r\nthe paper, and Prof. Barrett's plea for a committee of investigation on\r\nthought-transference fell through. So strong was the feeling against the\r\npaper in official scientific circles at the time, that even an abstract\r\nwas refused publication in the _Report_ of the British Association, and\r\nit was not until the Society for Psychical Research was founded that the\r\npaper was published, in the first volume of its _Proceedings_. It was\r\nthe need of a scientific society to collect, sift and discuss and\r\npublish the evidence on behalf of such supernormal phenomena as Prof.\r\nBarrett described at the British Association that induced him to call a\r\nconference in London at the close of 1881, which led to the foundation\r\nof the Society for Psychical Research early in 1882.\r\n\r\nWallace, in his letter to Prof. Barrett which follows, refers to\r\nReichenbach's experiments with certain sensitives who declared they saw\r\nluminosity from the poles of a magnet after they had been for some time\r\nin a perfectly darkened room. Acting on Wallace's suggestion, Prof.\r\nBarrett constructed a perfectly darkened room and employed a large\r\nelectro-magnet, the current for which could be made or broken by an\r\nassistant outside without the knowledge of those present in the darkened\r\nroom. Under these circumstances, and taking every precaution to prevent\r\nany knowledge of when the magnet was made active by the current, Prof.\r\nBarrett found that two or three persons, out of a large number with whom\r\nhe experimented, saw a luminosity streaming from the poles of the magnet\r\ndirectly the current was put on. An article of Prof. Barrett's on the\r\nsubject, with the details of the experiment, was published in the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_, and also in the _Proceedings_ of the Society\r\nfor Psychical Research (Vol. I.).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. BARRETT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rosehill, Dorking, December 18, 1876._\r\n\r\nMy dear Prof. Barrett,--  ... I see you are to lecture at South\r\nKensington the end of this month (I think), and if you can spare time to\r\nrun down here and stay a night or two we shall be much pleased to see\r\nyou, and I shall be greatly interested to have a talk on the subject of\r\nyour paper, and hear what further evidence you have obtained. I want\r\nparticularly to ask you to take advantage of any opportunity that you\r\nmay have to test the power of sensitives to see the \"flames\" from\r\nmagnets and crystals, as also to _feel_ the influence from them. This is\r\nsurely a matter easily tested and settled. I consider it has been tested\r\nand settled by Reichenbach, but he is ignored, and a fresh proof of this\r\none fact, by indisputable tests, is much needed; and a paper describing\r\nsuch tests and proofs would I imagine be admitted into the _Proceedings_\r\nof any suitable society.\r\n\r\nYou will have heard no doubt of the Treasury having taken up the\r\nprosecution of Slade. Massey the barrister, one of the most intelligent\r\nand able of the Spiritualists (whose accession to the cause is due, I am\r\nglad to say, to my article in the _Fortnightly_), proposes a memorial\r\nand deputation to the Government protesting against this prosecution by\r\nthe Treasury on the ground that it implies that Slade is an habitual\r\nimpostor and nothing else, and that in face of the body of evidence to\r\nthe contrary, it is an uncalled-for interference with the private right\r\nof investigation into these subjects. On such general grounds as these I\r\nsincerely hope you will give your name to the memorial....--Yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R. WALLACE. TO PROF. BARRETT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rosehill, Dorking. December 9, 1877._\r\n\r\nMy dear Barrett,--I am always glad when a man I like and respect treats\r\nme as a friend. I am advised by other friends also not to waste more\r\ntime on Dr. C. [Carpenter], and I do not think I shall answer him again,\r\nexcept perhaps to keep him to certain points, as in my letter in the\r\nlast _Nature_. In a proof of his new edition of \"Lectures\" I see he\r\nchallenges me to produce a person who can detect by light or sensation\r\nwhen an electro-magnet is made and unmade. The Association of\r\nSpiritualists are going to experiment, as Dr. C. offers to pay £30 if it\r\nsucceeds. Should you have an opportunity of trying with any persons, and\r\ncan find one who sees or feels the influence strongly, it might be worth\r\nwhile to send him to London, as nothing would tend to lower Dr. C. in\r\npublic estimation on this subject more than his being forced to\r\nacknowledge that what he has for more than thirty years declared to be\r\npurely subjective is after all an objective phenomenon.\r\n\r\nI never had anything to do with showing or sending a medium to Huxley.\r\nHe must refer to his séance a few months ago with Mrs. Kane and Mrs.\r\nJencken (along with Carpenter and Tyndall), when  ... nothing but raps\r\noccurred....--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British Association met in Dublin in 1878, and Prof. Barrett asked\r\nWallace to stay with him at Kingstown, or, if he preferred being nearer\r\nthe meetings, with a friend in Dublin. Earlier in the year Mr. Huggins,\r\nafterwards Sir W. Huggins, O.M. and President of the Royal Society, had\r\nsent Prof. Barrett a very beautifully executed drawing of the knots tied\r\nin an endless cord during the remarkable sittings Prof. Zöllner had with\r\nthe medium Slade. Sir W. Huggins invited Prof. Barrett to come and see\r\nhim at his observatory at Tulse Hill, near London, and there he met\r\nWallace and discussed the whole matter. It may not be generally known\r\nthat so careful and accurate an observer as Sir W. Huggins was convinced\r\nof the genuineness of the phenomena he had witnessed with Lord Dunraven\r\nand others through the medium D.D. Home. He informed Prof. Barrett of\r\nthis himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PROF. BARRETT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Waldron Edge, Duppas Hill, Croydon. June 27, 1873._\r\n\r\nMy dear Barrett,--The receipt of a British Association circular reminds\r\nme of your kind invitation to stay with you or your friend at Dublin,\r\nand as you may be wishing soon to make your arrangements I write at once\r\nto let you know that, much to my regret, I shall not be able to come to\r\nDublin this year. Since I met you at Mr. Huggins's I have done nothing\r\nmyself in Spiritual investigations, but have been exceedingly interested\r\nin the knot-tying experiment of Prof. Zöllner and the weight-varying\r\nexperiments of the Spiritualists' Association. I do not see what flaw\r\ncan be found in either of them....--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the discussion on Prof. Barrett's paper at the Glasgow Meeting of the\r\nBritish Association, which took place in the London _Times_ and other\r\nnewspapers, instances of apparent thought-transference were given by\r\nmany correspondents. Each of these cases Prof. Barrett investigated\r\npersonally, and one of them led to a remarkable series of experiments\r\nwhich he conducted at Buxton, with the result that no doubt was left on\r\nhis mind of the fact of the transference of ideas from one mind to\r\nanother independent of the ordinary channels of sense. He asked Prof.\r\nand Mrs. H. Sidgwick to come to Buxton and repeat his experiments with\r\nthe subjects there--daughters of a local clergyman. They did so, and\r\nthough they had less success at first than Prof. Barrett had had, they\r\nwere ultimately convinced of the genuineness of the phenomena. In\r\naddition, Mr. Edmund Gurney, Mr. Frederic Myers, Prof. A. Hopkinson and\r\nProf. Balfour Stewart, all responded to Prof. Barrett's invitation to\r\nvisit Buxton and test the matter for themselves, and all came to the\r\nsame conclusion as he had. Subsequently Gurney and Myers associated\r\ntheir name with Barrett's in a paper on the subject, published in the\r\n_Nineteenth Century_.\r\n\r\nProf. Barrett asked Wallace to read over the first report made by Prof.\r\nand Mrs. Sidgwick, which at first seemed somewhat disheartening, and the\r\nfollowing is his reply:\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT READING BY MR. AND MRS. SIDGWICK AT\r\nBUXTON\r\n\r\nThe failure of so many of these experiments seems to me to depend on\r\ntheir having been conducted without any knowledge of the main\r\npeculiarity of thought reading or clairvoyance--that it is a perception\r\nof the object thought of or hidden, not by its name, or even by its sum\r\ntotal of distinctive qualities, but by the simple qualities separately.\r\nA clairvoyant will perceive a thing as round, then as yellow, and\r\nfinally as an orange. Now Mr. Galton's experiments have shown how\r\nvarious are the powers of visualising objects possessed by different\r\npersons, and how distinct their modes of doing so; and if these distinct\r\nvisualisations of the same thing are in any way presented to a\r\nclairvoyant, there is little wonder that some confusion should result.\r\nThis would suggest that one person who possesses the faculty of clearly\r\nvisualising objects would meet with more success than a number of\r\npersons some of whom visualise one portion or quality of the object,\r\nsome another, while to others the name alone is present to the mind. It\r\nfollows from these considerations that cards are bad for such\r\nexperiments. The qualities of number, colour, form and arrangement may\r\nbe severally most prominent in one mind or other, and the result is\r\nconfusion to the thought reader. This is shown in the experiments by the\r\nnumber of pips or the suit alone being often right.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that children have not the same thorough\r\nknowledge of the names of the cards that we have, nor can they so\r\nrapidly and certainly count their numbers. This introduces another\r\nsource of uncertainty which should be avoided in such experiments as\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is still more clearly shown by the way in which objects\r\nare guessed by some prominent quality or resemblance, not by any\r\nlikeness of name--as poker guessed for walking-stick, fork for pipe,\r\nsomething iron for knife, etc. And the total failure in the case of\r\nnames of towns is clearly explained by the fact that these would convey\r\nno distinct idea or concrete image that could be easily described. These\r\nlast failures really give an important clue to the nature of the faculty\r\nthat is being investigated, since they show that it is not _words_ or\r\n_names_ that are read but thoughts or images that are perceived, and the\r\ncertainty of the perception will depend upon the simple character of\r\nthese images and the clearness and identity of the perception of them by\r\nthe different persons present.\r\n\r\nIf these considerations are always kept in view, I feel sure that the\r\nexperiments will be far more successful.\r\n\r\nALFRED E. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nSept. 6, 1881.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWallace's remarkable gifts as a lecturer are less widely known than his\r\nlucid and admirable style as a writer. Though Sir Wm. Barrett has heard\r\na great number of eminent scientific men lecture, he considers that few\r\ncould approach him for the simplicity, clearness and vigour of his\r\nexposition, which commanded the unflagging attention of every one of his\r\nhearers. Mr. Frederic Myers, no mean judge of literary merit, once said\r\nhe thought Wallace one of the most lucid English writers and lecturers\r\nof his time. Prof. Barrett was anxious to induce Wallace to lecture in\r\nDublin, and brought the matter before the Science Committee of the Royal\r\nDublin Society, which arranges a course of afternoon lectures by\r\ndistinguished men every spring. The Committee cordially supported the\r\nsuggestion that Wallace should be invited to lecture, and the invitation\r\nwas accepted. During his visit to Dublin, Wallace stayed with Prof.\r\nBarrett at Kingstown, and was busily engaged in revising the\r\nproof-sheets of his book on \"Land Nationalisation\" (1882).\r\n\r\nIn \"My Life\" (Vol. II., p. 334) Wallace says that among the eminent men\r\nwhose \"first acquaintance and valued friendship\" he owed to a common\r\ninterest in Spiritualism was Frederic Myers, whom he met first at some\r\nséances in London about the year 1878.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nF.W.H. MYERS TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leckhampton House, Cambridge. April 12, 1890._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I will read your pamphlet[61] most carefully; will\r\nwrite and tell you how it affects me; and will in any case send it on\r\nwith your letter and a letter of my own to Sir John Gorst, whom I know\r\nwell, and whom I agree with you in regarding as the most acceptable\r\nmember of the Government.\r\n\r\nIf I am converted, it will be wholly _your_ doing. I have read much on\r\nthe subject--Creighton, etc., and am at present strongly\r\npro-vaccination; at the same time, there is no one by whom I would more\r\nwillingly be converted than yourself.\r\n\r\nI am glad to take this opportunity of telling you something about my\r\nrelation to one of your books. I write now from bed, having had some\r\ninfluenzic pneumonia, now going off. For some days my temperature was\r\n105 and I was very restless at night, anxious to read, but in too\r\nsensitive and fastidious a state to tolerate almost any book. I found\r\nthat almost the only book which I could read was your \"Malay\r\nArchipelago\" (of course I had read it before). In spite of my complete\r\nignorance of natural history there was a certain charm about the book,\r\nboth moral and literary, which made it deeply congenial in those trying\r\nhours. You have had few less instructed readers, but very few can have\r\ndwelt on that simple manly record with a more profound sympathy.\r\n\r\nI want to bespeak you as a _friend at court_. When we get into the next\r\nworld, I beg you to remember me and say a good word for me when you can,\r\nas you will have much influence there.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems that Hodgson's report[62] is the _best_ thing which we\r\nhave yet published. I trust that it impresses you equally. It has\r\nconverted _Podmore_ amongst other people!\r\n\r\nI will, then, write again soon, and I am yours most truly,\r\n\r\nF.W.H. MYERS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FISHER (_née_ BUCKLEY)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. January 4, 1896._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Fisher,--I am glad to hear that you are going on with your\r\nbook. I am sure it will be a comfort to you. I have read one book of\r\nHudson's--\"A Scientific Demonstration of a Future Life,\" and that is so\r\npretentious, so unscientific, and so one-sided that I do not feel\r\ninclined to read more of the same author's work. I do not think I\r\nmentioned to you (as I thought you did not read much now) a really fine\r\nand original work, called \"Psychic Philosophy, a Religion of Natural\r\nLaw,\" by Desertis (Redway). I should like to know if, after reading\r\nthat, you still think Hudson's books worth reading. I have been much\r\npleased and interested lately in reading Mark Twain's, Mrs. Oliphant's\r\nand Andrew Lang's books about Joan of Arc. The last two are far the\r\nbest, Mrs. Oliphant's as a genuine sympathetic _history_, Lang's as a\r\nfine realistic story (\"A Monk of Fife\"). Jeanne was really perhaps the\r\nmost beautiful character in authentic history, and the one that most\r\nconclusively demonstrates spirit-guidance, and both Mrs. Oliphant and A.\r\nLang bring this out admirably.... --Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. September 14, 1896._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Fisher,--I have much pleasure in signing your application\r\nfor the Psychical Research Society, though the majority of the active\r\nmembers are so absurdly and illogically sceptical that you will not find\r\nmuch instruction in their sayings. Mr. Podmore's report in the\r\nlast-issued _Proceedings_ is a good illustration....\r\n\r\nWe have all been in Switzerland this year. Violet, her mother, and five\r\nlady friends all went together to a rather newly-discovered place,\r\nAdelboden, a branch valley from that going up to the Gemmi Pass by\r\nKandersteg. I went first for a week to Davos, to give a lecture to Dr.\r\nLunn's party, and enjoyed myself much, chiefly owing to the company of\r\nRev. Hugh Price Hughes, one of the most witty, earnest, advanced, and\r\nestimable men I have ever met. Dr. Lunn himself is very jolly, and we\r\nhad also Mr. Le Gallienne, the poet and critic, and between them we had\r\na very brilliant table-talk. Mr. Haweis was also there, and one\r\nafternoon he and I talked for two hours about Spiritualism. He is a\r\nthorough spiritualist, and preaches it....--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE. TO MRS. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. April 9, 1897._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Fisher,--I have tried several Reincarnation and\r\nTheosophical books, but _cannot_ read them or take any interest in them.\r\nThey are so purely imaginative, and do not seem to me rational. Many\r\npeople are captivated by it--I think most people who like a grand,\r\nstrange, complex theory of man and nature, given with authority--people\r\nwho if religious would be Roman Catholics. Crookes gave a suggestive and\r\ninteresting, but in some ways rather misleading address as President of\r\nthe Psychical Research Society. I liked Oliver Lodge's address to the\r\nSpiritualists' Association better....--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1891, at the urgent request of Prof. H. Sidgwick, President of the\r\nSociety for Psychical Research, Prof. Barrett undertook, with\r\nconsiderable reluctance, to make a thorough examination of the subject\r\nof \"dowsing\" for water and minerals by means of the so-called \"divining\r\nrod.\" At the time he fully believed that a critical inquiry of this kind\r\nwould speedily show all the alleged successes of the dowser to be due\r\neither to fraud or a sharp eye for the ground. As the inquiry went on,\r\nto his surprise he found that neither chicanery, nor clever guessing,\r\nnor local knowledge, nor chance coincidence could explain away the\r\naccumulated evidence, but that something new to science was really at\r\nthe root of the matter. This result was so startling that Prof. Barrett\r\nhad to pursue the investigation for six years before venturing to\r\npublish his first report, which appeared in the _Proceedings_ of the\r\nSociety for Psychical Research, Part xxxii., 1897. This was followed by\r\na second report published some years later, in which he gave a fresh\r\nbody of evidence on the criticisms of some eminent geologists to whom he\r\nhad submitted the evidence. The reports were reviewed in _Nature_ with\r\nconsiderable severity, and some erroneous statements were made, to\r\nwhich Prof. Barrett replied. The editor, Sir Norman Lockyer, at first\r\ndeclined to publish Prof. Barrett's reply, and to this Wallace refers in\r\nthe following letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. BARRETT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. October 30, 1899._\r\n\r\nMy dear Barrett,--  ... Apropos of _Nature_, they never gave a word of\r\nnotice to my book[63]--probably they would say out of kindness to myself\r\nas one of their oldest contributors, since they would have had to\r\nscarify me, especially as regards the huge Vaccination chapter, which is\r\nnevertheless about the most demonstrative bit of work I have done. I\r\nbegged Myers--as a personal favour--to read it. He told me he firmly\r\nbelieved in vaccination, but would do so, and afterwards wrote me that\r\nhe could see no answer to it, and if there was none he was converted.\r\nThere certainly has been not a tittle of answer except abuse.\r\n\r\nI am glad you brought Lockyer up sharp in his attempt to refuse you the\r\nright to reply. I am glad you now have some personal observations to\r\nadduce. I hope persons or corporations who are going to employ a dowser\r\nwill now advise you so that you may be present....--Yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. BARRETT\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. December 24, 1900._\r\n\r\nMy dear Barrett,--  ... I have read your very interesting paper on the\r\ndivining rod, and the additional evidence you now send. Of course, I\r\nthink it absolutely conclusive, but there are many points on which I\r\ndiffer from your conclusions and remarks, which I think are often unfair\r\nto the dowsers. I will just refer to one or two. At p. 176 (note) you\r\ncall the idea of there being a \"spring-head\" at a particular point\r\n\"absurd.\" But instead of being absurd it is a _fact_, proved not only by\r\nnumerous cases you have given of strong springs being found quite near\r\nto weak springs a few yards off, but by all the phenomena of mineral and\r\nhot springs. Near together, as at Bath, hot springs and cold springs\r\nrise to the surface, and springs of different quality at Harrogate, yet\r\neach keeps its distinct character, showing that each rises from a great\r\ndepth without any lateral diffusion or intermixture. This is a common\r\nphenomenon all over the world, the dowsers' facts support it, geologists\r\nknow all about it, yet I presume they have told you that when a dowser\r\nstates this fact it ceases to be a fact and becomes an absurdity!\r\n\r\nThe only other point I have time to notice is your Sect. II. (p. 285).\r\nYou head this, \"Evidence that the Motion of the Rod is due to\r\nUnconscious Muscular Action.\" Naturally I read this with the greatest\r\ninterest, but found to my astonishment that you adduce no evidence at\r\nall, but only opinions of various people, and positive assertions that\r\nsuch is the case! Now as I _know_ that motions of various objects occur\r\nwithout any muscular action, or even any contact whatever, while Crookes\r\nhas proved this by careful experiments which have never been refuted,\r\nwhat _improbability_ is there that this should be such a case, and what\r\nis the value of these positive assertions which you quote as \"evidence\"?\r\nAnd at p. 286 you quote the person who says the more he tried to prevent\r\nthe stick's turning the more it turned, as _evidence_ in favour of\r\nmuscular action, without a word of explanation. Another man (p. 287)\r\nsays he \"could not restrain it.\" None of the \"trained anatomists\" you\r\nquote give a particle of _proof_, only positive opinion, that it must be\r\nmuscular action--simply because they do not believe any other action\r\npossible. Their evidence is just as valueless as that of the people who\r\nsay that all thought-transference is collusion or imposture!\r\n\r\nI do not say that it is not \"muscular action,\" though I believe it is\r\nnot always so, but I do say that you have as yet given not a particle of\r\nproof that it is so, while scattered through your paper is plenty of\r\nevidence which points to its being something quite different. Such are\r\nthe cases when people hold the rod for the first time and have never\r\nseen a dowser work, yet the rod turns, over water, to their great\r\nastonishment, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nYour conclusion that it is \"clairvoyance\" is a good provisional\r\nconclusion, but till we know what clairvoyance really is it explains\r\nnothing, and is merely another way of stating the _fact_.\r\n\r\nI believe all true clairvoyance to be spirit impression, and that all\r\ntrue dowsing is the same--that is, when in either case it cannot be\r\nthought-transference, but even this I believe to be also, for the most\r\npart, if not wholly, spirit impression.--Believe me yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PROF. BARRETT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. February 17, 1901._\r\n\r\nMy dear Barrett,--I am rather sorry you wrote to any one of the Society\r\nfor Psychical Research people about my being asked to be President,\r\nbecause I should certainly feel compelled to decline it. I never go,\r\nwillingly, to London now, and should never attend meetings, so pray say\r\nno more about it. Besides, I am so widely known as a \"crank\" and a\r\n\"faddist\" that my being President would injure the Society, as much as\r\nLord Rayleigh would benefit it, so pray do not put any obstacle in _his_\r\nway, though of course there is no necessity to beg him as a favour to\r\nbe the successor of Sidgwick, Crookes and Myers....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO REV. J.B. HENDERSON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. August 10, 1893._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Although I look upon Christianity as originating in an\r\nunusual spiritual influx, I am not disposed to consider [it] as\r\n_essentially_ different from those which originated other great\r\nreligious and philanthropic movements. It is probable that in _your_\r\nsense of the word I am not a Christian.--Believe me yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. J.W. MARSHALL\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. March 6, 1894._\r\n\r\nMy dear Marshall,--We were very much grieved to hear of your sad loss in\r\na letter from Violet. Pray accept our sincere sympathy for Mrs. Marshall\r\nand yourself.\r\n\r\nDeath makes us feel, in a way nothing else can do, the mystery of the\r\nuniverse. Last autumn I lost my sister, and she was the only relative I\r\nhave been with at the last. For the moment it seems unnatural and\r\nincredible that the living self with its special idiosyncrasies you have\r\nknown so long can have left the body, still more unnatural that it\r\nshould (as so many now believe) have utterly ceased to exist and become\r\nnothingness!\r\n\r\nWith all my belief in, and knowledge of, Spiritualism, I have, however,\r\noccasional qualms of doubt, the remnants of my original deeply ingrained\r\nscepticism; but my reason goes to support the psychical and\r\nspiritualistic phenomena in telling me that there _must_ be a hereafter\r\nfor us all....--Believe me yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO DR. EDWIN SMITH\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. October 19, 1899._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I know nothing of London mediums now. Nine-tenths of the\r\nalleged frauds in mediums arise from the ignorance of the sitters. The\r\nonly way to gain any real knowledge of spiritualistic phenomena is to\r\nfollow the course pursued in all science--study the elements before\r\ngoing to the higher branches. To expect proof of materialisation before\r\nbeing satisfied of the reality of such simpler phenomena as raps,\r\nmovements of various objects, etc. etc., is as if a person began\r\nchemistry by trying to analyse the more complex vegetable products\r\nbefore he knew the composition of water and the simplest salts.\r\n\r\nIf you want to _know_ anything about Spiritualism you should experiment\r\nyourself with a select party of earnest inquirers--personal friends.\r\nWhen you have thus satisfied yourself of the existence of a considerable\r\nrange of the physical phenomena and of many of the obscurities and\r\ndifficulties of the inquiry, you may use the services of public mediums,\r\nwithout the certainty of imputing every little apparent suspicious\r\ncircumstance to trickery, since you will have seen similar suspicious\r\nfacts in your private circle where you _knew_ there was no trickery. You\r\nwill find rules for forming private circles in some issues of _Light_.\r\nYou can get them from the office of _Light_.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROF. BARRETT TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n_6 De Vesci Terrace, Kingstown, Co. Dublin. November 3, 1905._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--  ... Just now I am engaged in a correspondence with\r\nthe Secretaries of the Society for Psychical Research on the question of\r\nthe Presidency for next year. I maintain that as a matter of duty to\r\nthe Society you should be asked to accept the Presidency, though of\r\ncourse it would be impossible for you to be much more than an Honorary\r\nPresident, as we could not expect you often to come to London. I am\r\nanxious that in our records for future reference your Presidency should\r\nappear.... Podmore, who is proposed as President, represents the\r\nattitude of resolute incredulity, and I consider this line of action has\r\nbeen to some extent injurious to the S.P.R. Crookes supported my\r\nproposal, and so did Lodge, and so would Myers if he had lived. All this\r\nis of course between ourselves....\r\n\r\nI have a vast amount of material unpublished on \"dowsing\" and am\r\nconvinced the explanation is subconscious clairvoyance....--Yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nW.F.

April 20, 1906._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Fisher,--If you mean \"honest\" by \"thoroughly reliable,\"\r\nthere are plenty of such mediums, but if you mean those who give equally\r\ngood results always, and to all persons, I should say there are none....\r\n\r\nI am reading Herbert Spencer's \"Autobiography\" (just finished Vol. I.).\r\nI find it very interesting, though tedious in parts. I am glad I did not\r\nread it before I wrote mine. He certainly brings out his own character\r\nmost strikingly, and a wonderful character it was. How extraordinarily\r\nlittle he owed either to teaching or to reading! I think he is best\r\ndescribed as a \"reasoning genius.\"--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

May 1, 1910._\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,--I have been reading your biography with great\r\ninterest. It must be a source of very pleasant memories to you to look\r\nback and feel how much you have accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt surprises me, however, how much we differ, and it is another\r\nillustration of the problems [?] of our (or rather I should say of my)\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, indeed, the difference is as to facts.\r\n\r\nYou would, I am sure, for instance, find that you have been misinformed\r\nas to \"thousands of dogs\" being vivisected annually (p. 392).... As to\r\nSpiritualism, my difficulty is that nothing comes of it. What has been\r\ngained by your séances, compared to your studies?\r\n\r\nI see you have a kindly reference to our parties at High Elms in old\r\ndays, on which I often look back with much pleasure, but much regret\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nIf you would give us the pleasure of another visit, _do_ propose\r\nyourself, and you will have a very hearty welcome from yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nAVEBURY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA lecture delivered by Prof. Barrett before the Quest Society in London,\r\nentitled \"Creative Thought,\" was published by request, and as it\r\ndiscussed the subject of evolution and the impossibility of explaining\r\nthe phenomena of life without a supreme Directing and Formative Force\r\nbehind all the manifestations of life, he was anxious to have Wallace's\r\ncriticisms. At that time he had not read Wallace's recently published\r\nwork on a similar subject, and he was greatly surprised to find how\r\nclosely his views agreed with those of the great naturalist.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PROF.

It is really\r\ncurious how closely your views coincide with mine, and how admirably and\r\nclearly you have expressed them. If it were not for your adopting\r\nthroughout, as an actual fact, the (to me) erroneous theory of the\r\n\"subconscious self,\" I should agree with every word of it. I have put\r\n\"?\" where this is prominently put forward, merely to let you know how I\r\ntotally dissent from it. To me it is pure assumption, and, besides,\r\nproves nothing. Thanks for the flattering \"Postscript,\" which I return\r\nwith a slight suggested alteration.\r\n\r\nReviews have been generally very fair, complimentary and flattering. But\r\nto me it is very curious that even the religious reviewers seem\r\nhorrified and pained at the idea that the Infinite Being does not\r\nactually do every detail himself, apparently leaving his angels, and\r\narchangels, his seraphs and his messengers, which seem to exist in\r\nmyriads according to the Bible, to have no function whatever!--Yours\r\nvery truly,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

Thank you very much for your kind letter and\r\ncomments. I have modified somewhat the phraseology as regards the\r\n\"subliminal self.\" I think we really agree but use different terms.\r\nThere _is_ a hidden directive power, which works in conjunction with,\r\nand is temporarily part of, our own conscious self; but it is below the\r\nthreshold of consciousness, or is a subliminal part of our self.\r\n\r\nI should like to have come over to Broadstone expressly to ask your\r\nviews on the parts you queried. For I have an immense faith in the\r\nsoundness of your judgment, and in the accuracy of your views _in the\r\nlong run_.\r\n\r\nI should like also immensely to see you again and in your lovely\r\nhome....--Yours ever sincerely,\r\n\r\nW.F.

Most of my queries to your statements\r\napply solely to your expressing them so positively, as if they were\r\nabsolute certainties which no psychical researcher doubted. My main\r\nobjection to the term \"subliminal self\" and its various synonyms is,\r\nthat it is so dreadfully vague, and is an excuse for the assumption that\r\na whole series of the most mysterious of psychical phenomena are held to\r\nbe actually explained by it. Thus it is applied to explain all cases of\r\napparent \"possession,\" when the alleged \"secondary self\" has a totally\r\ndifferent character, and uses the dialect of another social grade, from\r\nthe normal self, sometimes even possesses knowledge that the real self\r\ncould not have acquired, speaks a language that the normal self never\r\nlearnt. All this is, to me, the most gross travesty of science, and I\r\ntherefore object totally to the use of the term which is so vaguely and\r\nabsurdly used, and of which no clear and rational explanation has ever\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\nYou are now one of my oldest friends, and one with whom I most\r\nsympathise; and I only regret that we have seen so little of each\r\nother.--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R.

Thou not least but last\r\n  Link with that rare and gallant little band\r\n  Of seekers after truth, whose days, though past,\r\n  Shed lustre on the hist'ry of their land.\r\n  And thine, O Wallace, thine the added charm\r\n  Of modesty, thy mem'ry to embalm.\"--_Anonymous._\r\n\r\n(_Received with a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley, a few days after Dr.\r\nWallace's death_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAddison somewhere says that modesty sets off every talent which a man\r\ncan be possessed of. This was manifestly true of Alfred Russel Wallace.\r\nWhen, for instance, honours were bestowed upon him, he accepted or\r\nrejected them with the same good-humour and unspoilable modesty. To\r\nProf. E.B. Poulton, whose invitation for the forthcoming Encæmia had\r\nbeen conveyed in Prof. Bartholomew Price's letter, he wrote:\r\n\r\n_Godalming. May 28, 1889._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Poulton,--I have just received from Prof. B. Price the\r\ntotally unexpected offer of the honorary degree of D.C.L. at the coming\r\nCommemoration, and you will probably be surprised and _disgusted_ to\r\nhear that I have declined it. I have to thank you for your kind offer of\r\nhospitality during the ceremony, but the fact is, I have at all times a\r\nprofound distaste of all public ceremonials, and at this particular\r\ntime that distaste is stronger than ever. I have never recovered from\r\nthe severe illness I had a year and a half ago, and it is in hopes of\r\nrestoring my health that I have let my cottage here and have taken\r\nanother at Parkstone, Dorset, into which I have arranged to move on\r\nMidsummer Day. To add to my difficulties, I have work at examination\r\npapers for the next two or three weeks, and also a meeting (annual) of\r\nour Land Nationalisation Society, so that the work of packing my books\r\nand other things and looking after the plants which I have to move from\r\nmy garden will have to be done in a very short time. Under these\r\ncircumstances it would be almost impossible for me to rush away to\r\nOxford except under absolute compulsion, and to do so would be to render\r\na ceremony which at any time would be a trial, a positive punishment.\r\n\r\nReally the greatest kindness my friends can do me is to leave me in\r\npeaceful obscurity, for I have lived so secluded a life that I am more\r\nand more disinclined to crowds of any kind. I had to submit to it in\r\nAmerica, but then I felt exceptionally well, whereas now I am altogether\r\nweak and seedy and not at all up to fatigue or excitement.--Yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE. Prof. Poulton pressed him to reconsider his decision,\r\nand he reluctantly gave way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Godalming. June 2, 1889._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Poulton,--I am exceedingly obliged by your kind letters, and\r\nI will say at once that if the Council of the University should again\r\nask me to accept the degree, to be conferred in the autumn, as you\r\npropose, I could not possibly refuse it. At the same time I hope you\r\nwill not in any way urge it upon them, as I really feel myself too much\r\nof an amateur in Natural History and altogether too ignorant (I left\r\nschool--a bad one--finally, at fourteen) to receive honours from a great\r\nUniversity. But I will say no more about that.--Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nA.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn due course he received the degree. \"On that occasion,\" says Professor\r\nPoulton, \"Wallace stayed with us, and I was anxious to show him\r\nsomething of Oxford; but, with all that there is to be seen, one subject\r\nalone absorbed the whole of his interest--he was intensely anxious to\r\nfind the rooms where Grant Allen had lived. He had received from Grant\r\nAllen's father a manuscript poem giving a picture of the ancient city\r\ndimly seen by midnight from an undergraduate's rooms. With the help of\r\nGrant Allen's college friends we were able to visit every house in which\r\nhe had lived, but were forced to conclude that the poem was written in\r\nthe rooms of a friend or from an imaginary point of view.\"\r\n\r\nHis friend Sir W.T. Thiselton-Dyer, with others, was promoting his\r\nelection to the Royal Society, and wrote to him:\r\n\r\nSIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kew. October 23, 1892._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--  ... When you were at Kew this summer I took the\r\nliberty of saying that it would give great pleasure to the Fellows of\r\nthe Royal Society if you would be willing to join their body. I\r\nunderstood you to say that it would be agreeable to you. I now propose\r\nto comply with the necessary formalities. But before doing so it will be\r\nproper to ask for your formal consent. You will then, as a matter of\r\ncourse, be included in the next annual election.\r\n\r\nWill you forgive me if I am committing any indiscretion in saying that I\r\nhave good authority for adding (though I suppose it can hardly be stated\r\nofficially at this stage) that no demand will ever be made upon you for\r\na subscription?--Believe me yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nW.T. THISELTON-DYER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kew. January 12, 1893._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--  ... I was very vexed to hear that I had\r\nmisunderstood your wishes about the Royal Society. Of course, the matter\r\nmust often have presented itself to your mind, and I confess that it\r\nargued a little presumption on the part of a person like myself, so far\r\ninferior to you in age and standing, to think that you would yield to my\r\nsolicitation.\r\n\r\nI was obliged for my health to go to Eastbourne, and there I had the\r\npleasure of seeing Mr. Huxley, who, you will be glad to hear, is\r\nwonderfully well, and an ardent gardener! His present ambition is to\r\ngrow every possible saxifrage.\r\n\r\nI told him that I had had the audacity to approach you on the subject of\r\nthe Royal Society. He heartily approved, and expressed the strongest\r\nopinion that unless you had some insuperable objection you ought to\r\nyield. All of us who belong to the R.S. have but one wish, which is that\r\nit should stand before the public as containing all that is best and\r\nworthiest in British Science. As long as men like you stand aloof, that\r\ncannot be said. Lately we have been exposed to some very ill-natured\r\nattacks: we have been told that we are professional, and not\r\ndiscoverers. Well, this is all the more reason for your not holding\r\naloof from us. I wish you would think it over again. Huxley went the\r\nlength of saying that to him it seemed a plain duty. But this is\r\nlanguage I do not like to use.\r\n\r\nAs to attending the meetings or taking part in the work of the Society,\r\nthat is immaterial. Darwin never did either, though he did once come to\r\none of the evening receptions, and enjoyed it immensely.\r\n\r\nIn writing as I do I am not merely expressing my own opinions, but those\r\nof many others of my own standing who are keenly interested in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIt is not a great matter to ask. I have the certificate ready. You have\r\nbut to say the word. You will be put to no trouble or pecuniary\r\nresponsibility. That my father-in-law arranged, long ago.\r\n\r\nTo dissociate yourself from the R.S. really amounts nowadays to doing it\r\nan injury. And I am sure you do not wish that.\r\n\r\nWith all good wishes, believe me yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nW.T. THISELTON-DYER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO SIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. January 17, 1893._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Thiselton-Dyer,--I have been rather unwell myself the last few\r\ndays or should have answered your very kind letter sooner. I feel really\r\noverpowered. I cannot understand why you or anyone should care about my\r\nbeing an F.R.S., because I have really done so little of what is usually\r\nconsidered scientific work to deserve it. I have for many years felt\r\nalmost ashamed of the amount of reputation and honour that has been\r\nawarded me. I can understand the general public thinking too highly of\r\nme, because I know that I have the power of clear exposition, and, I\r\nthink, also, of logical reasoning. But all the work I have done is more\r\nor less amateurish and founded almost wholly on other men's\r\nobservations; and I always feel myself dreadfully inferior to men like\r\nSir J. Hooker, Huxley, Flower, and scores of younger men who have\r\nextensive knowledge of whole departments of biology of which I am\r\ntotally ignorant. I do not wish, however, to be thought ungrateful for\r\nthe many honours that have been given me by the Royal and other\r\nSocieties, and will therefore place myself entirely in your hands as\r\nregards my election to the F.R.S.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased to hear that Huxley has taken to gardening. I have no\r\ndoubt he will do some good work with his saxifrages. For myself the\r\npersonal attention to my plants occupies all my spare time, and I derive\r\nconstant enjoyment from the mere contemplation of the infinite variety\r\nof forms of leaf and flower, and modes of growth, and strange\r\npeculiarities of structure which are the source of fresh puzzles and\r\nfresh delights year by year. With best wishes and many thanks for the\r\ntrouble you are taking on my behalf, believe me yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED B. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the _Standard_ announced that the degree of D.C.L. was to be\r\nconferred upon him by the University of Wales. He wrote to Miss Dora\r\nBest, who had sent him the information:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not seen the _Standard_. But I suppose it is about the offer of a\r\ndegree by the University of Wales. You will not be surprised to hear\r\nthat I have declined it \"with thanks.\" The bother, the ceremony, the\r\nhaving perhaps to get a blue or yellow or scarlet gown! and at all\r\nevents new black clothes and a new topper! such as I have not worn this\r\ntwenty years. Luckily I had a good excuse in having committed the same\r\noffence before. Some ten years back I declined the offer of a degree\r\nfrom Cambridge, so that settled it.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Having already degrees two--LL.D. (Dublin) and D.C.L. (Oxford)--I\r\nmight have quoted Shakespeare: \"To gild refined gold, to paint the\r\nlily,\" etc. But I didn't!--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1908 he received the Order of Merit, the highest honour conferred\r\nupon him. To his friend Mrs. Fisher he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mrs. Fisher,--Is it not awful--two more now! I should think very\r\nfew men have had three such honours within six months! I have never felt\r\nmyself worthy of the Copley Medal--and as to the Order of Merit--to be\r\ngiven to a red-hot Radical, Land Nationaliser, Socialist,\r\nAnti-Militarist, etc. etc. etc., is quite astounding and\r\nunintelligible!...\r\n\r\nThere is another thing you have not heard yet, but it will be announced\r\nsoon. Sir W. Crookes, as Secretary of the Royal Institution, wrote to me\r\ntwo weeks back asking me very strongly to give them a lecture at their\r\nopening meeting (third week in January) appropriate to the Jubilee of\r\nthe \"Origin of Species.\" I was very unwell at the time--could eat\r\nnothing, etc.--and was going to decline positively, having nothing more\r\nto say! But while lying down, vaguely thinking about it, an idea flashed\r\nupon me of a new treatment of the whole subject of Darwinism, just\r\nsuitable for a lecture to a R.I. audience. I felt at once there was\r\nsomething that ought to be said, and that I should like to say--so I\r\nactually wrote and accepted, provisionally. My voice has so broken that\r\nunless I can improve it I fear not being heard, but Crookes promised to\r\nread it either wholly, or leaving to me the opening and concluding\r\nparagraphs. I was very weak--almost a skeleton--but I am now getting\r\nmuch better. But finishing up the \"Spruce\" book, and now all these\r\nhonours and congratulations and letters, etc., are giving me much work,\r\nyet I am getting strong again, and really hope to do this \"lecture\" as\r\nmy last stroke for Darwinism against the Mutationists and Mendelians,\r\nbut much more effective, I hope, than my article in the August\r\n_Contemporary Review_, though that was pretty strong.--Yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\nHow more than true \"Sunlight's\"[64] words have come, \"You will come out\r\nof the hole! You will be more in the world. You will have satisfaction,\r\nretrospection, and work\"! Literally fulfilled!--A.R.W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd to Mr. F. Birch:\r\n\r\n_December 30, 1908._\r\n\r\nDear Fred,--  ... I received a letter from Lord Knollys--the King's\r\nPrivate Secretary--informing me that His Majesty proposed to offer me\r\nthe Order of Merit, among the Birthday honours! This is an \"Order\"\r\nestablished by the present King about eight years ago, solely for\r\n\"merit\"--whether civil or military--it is a pity it was not civil only,\r\nas the military have so many distinctions already. So I had to compose a\r\nvery polite letter of acceptance and thanks, and then later I had to beg\r\nto be excused (on the ground of age and delicate health) from attending\r\nthe investiture at Buckingham Palace (on December 14th), when Court\r\ndress--a kind of very costly livery--is obligatory! and I was kept for\r\nweeks waiting. But at last one of the King's Equerries, Col. Legge (an\r\nEarl's son), came down here about two weeks ago bringing the Order,\r\nwhich is a very handsome cross in red and blue enamel and gold--rich\r\ncolours--with a crown above, and a rich ribbed-silk blue and crimson\r\nriband to hang it round the neck! Col. Legge was very pleasant, stayed\r\nhalf an hour, had some tea, and showed us how to wear it. So I shall be\r\nin duty bound to wear it on the only public occasion I shall be seen\r\nagain (in all probability), when I give (or attempt to give) my\r\nlecture.[65] Then, I had a letter from Windsor telling me that chalk\r\nportraits of all the members of the Order were to be taken for the\r\ncollections in the Library, and a Mr. Strang came and stayed the night,\r\nand in four hours completed a very good life-size head, in coloured\r\nchalk, and so far, so good!--Yours very sincerely, ALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWallace regarded \"Sunlight's\" prophecy about \"retrospection\" as being\r\nfulfilled in 1904, when he received the invitation of Messrs. Chapman\r\nand Hall to begin collecting material for his autobiography which was\r\nsubsequently published in two large volumes, under the title of \"My\r\nLife.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to this work he wrote to Mrs. Fisher:\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Dorset. April_ 17, 1904.\r\n\r\nDear Mrs. Fisher,--Thanks for your remarks on what an autobiography\r\nought to be. But I am afraid I shall fall dreadfully short. I seem to\r\nremember nothing but ordinary facts and incidents of no interest to\r\nanyone but my own family. I do not feel myself that anything has much\r\ninfluenced my character or abilities, such as they are. Lots of things\r\nhave given me opportunities, and those I can state. Also other things\r\nhave directed me into certain lines, but I can't dilate on these; and\r\nreally, with the exception of Darwin and Sir Charles Lyell, I have come\r\ninto close relations with hardly any eminent men. All my doings and\r\nsurroundings have been commonplace!\r\n\r\nI am now just reading a charming and ideal bit of autobiography--Robert\r\nDale Owen's \"Threading my Way.\" If you have not read it, do get it\r\n(published by Trübner and Co. in 1874). It is delightful. So simple and\r\nnatural throughout. But his father was one of the most wonderful men of\r\nthe nineteenth century--Robert Owen of New Lanark--and this book gives\r\nthe true history of his great success. Then R.D. Owen met Clarkson and\r\nheard from his own lips how he worked to abolish the slave trade.\r\n\r\nThen he had part of his education at Hofwyl under Fellenberg, an\r\nexperiment in education and self-government wonderfully original and\r\nsuccessful. He afterwards worked at \"New Harmony\" with his father, and\r\nmet during his life almost all the most remarkable people in England and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThis book only contains the first twenty-seven years of his life and I\r\nam afraid he never completed it. Such a book makes me despair!--Yours\r\nvery sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen \"My Life\" was published, he wrote to the same old and valued\r\nfriend:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broadstone, Wimborne. November 7, 1905._\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Fisher,--The reviewers are generally very fair about the\r\nfads except a few. The _Review_ invents a new word for me--I am an\r\n\"anti-body\"; but the _Outlook_ is the richest: I am the one man who\r\nbelieves in Spiritualism, phrenology, anti-vaccination, and the\r\ncentrality of the earth in the universe, whose life is worth writing.\r\nThen it points out a few things I am capable of believing, but which\r\neverybody else knows to be fallacies, and compares me to Sir I. Newton\r\nwriting on the prophets! Yet of course he praises my biology up to the\r\nskies--there I am wise--everywhere else I am a kind of weak, babyish\r\nidiot! It is really delightful!\r\n\r\nOnly one is absolutely savage about it all--the _Liverpool_ _Daily Post\r\nand Mercury_. The reviewer devotes over three columns almost wholly to\r\nthe fads--as to all of which he evidently knows absolutely nothing, but\r\nhe is cocksure that I am always wrong!...--Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe always thought that he was deficient in the gift of humour: \"I am,\"\r\nhe wrote to Mr. J.W. Marshall (May 6, 1905), \"still grinding away at my\r\nautobiography. Have got to my American lecture tour, and hope to finish\r\nby about Sept. but have such lots of interruptions. I am just reading\r\nHuxley's Life. Some of his letters are inimitable, but the whole is\r\nrather monotonous. I find there is a good deal of variety in my life if\r\nI had but the gift of humour! Alas! I could not make a joke to save my\r\nlife. But I find it very interesting.\" \"Unless somebody,\" he wrote to\r\nMiss Evans, \"can make me laugh just before the critical moment I always\r\nhave a horrid expression in photographs.\" Yet another observant friend\r\nremarked that \"he had a keen sense of humour. It was always his boyish\r\njoyous exuberance which touched me. He never grew old. When I had sat\r\nwith him an hour he was a young man, he became transfigured to me.\"  ...\r\n\"The last time I saw Dr. Wallace,\" writes Prof. T.D.A. Cockerell of\r\nColorado, \"was immediately after the Darwin Celebration at Cambridge in\r\n1909. I was the first to give him the details concerning it, and vividly\r\nremember how interested he was, and how heartily he laughed over some of\r\nthe funny incidents, which may not as yet be told in print. One of his\r\nmost prominent characteristics was his keen sense of humour, and his\r\nenjoyment of a good story.\" In the summer of 1885 he spent a holiday\r\nwith Prof. Meldola at Lyme Regis. \"After our ramble,\" said the\r\nProfessor, \"we used to spend the evenings indoors, I reading aloud the\r\n'Ingoldsby Legends,' which Wallace richly enjoyed. His humour was a\r\ndelightful characteristic. 'The inimitable puns of T. Hood were,' he\r\nsaid, 'the delight of my youth, as is the more recondite and fantastic\r\nhumour of Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll in my old age.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWallace loved to give time and trouble in aiding young men to start in\r\nlife, especially if they were endeavouring to become naturalists. He\r\nsent them letters of advice, helped them in the choice of the right\r\ncountry to visit, and gave them minute practical instructions how to\r\nlive healthily and to maintain themselves. He put their needs before\r\nother and more fortunate scientific workers and besought assistance for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"The central secret of his personal magnetism lay in his wide and\r\nunselfish sympathy,\" writes Prof. Poulton.[66] \"It might be thought by\r\nthose who did not know Wallace that the noble generosity which will\r\nalways stand as an example before the world was something\r\nspecial--called forth by the illustrious man with whom he was brought in\r\ncontact. This would be a great mistake. Wallace's attitude was\r\ncharacteristic, and characteristic to the end of his life.\r\n\r\n\"A keen young naturalist in the North of England, taking part in an\r\nexcursion to the New Forest, called on Wallace and confided to him the\r\ndream of his life--a first-hand knowledge of tropical nature. When I\r\nvisited 'Old Orchard' in the summer of 1903, I found that Wallace was\r\nintently interested in two things: his garden, and the means by which\r\nhis young friend's dream might best be realised. The subject was\r\nreferred to in seventeen letters to me; it formed the sole topic of some\r\nof them. It was a grand and inspiring thing to see this great man\r\nidentifying himself heart and soul with the interests of one--till then\r\na stranger--in whom he recognised the passionate longings of his own\r\nyouth. By the force of sympathy he re-lived in the life of another the\r\nsplendid years of early manhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Prof. Knight recalled meeting him at the British Association in\r\nDundee, during the year 1867, when Wallace was his guest for the usual\r\ntime of the gathering. He wrote:\r\n\r\n    I, and everyone else who then met him at my house, were struck, as\r\n    no one could fail to be, by his rare urbanity, his social charm,\r\n    his modesty, his unobtrusive strength, his courtesy in explaining\r\n    matters with which he was himself familiar but those he conversed\r\n    with were not; and his abounding interest, not only in almost\r\n    every branch of Science, but in human knowledge in all its phases,\r\n    especially new ones. He was a many-sided scientific man, and had a\r\n    vivid sense of humour. He greatly enjoyed anecdote, as\r\n    illustrative of character. During those days he talked much on the\r\n    fundamental relations between Science and Philosophy, as well as\r\n    on the connection of Poetry with both of them. When he left Dundee\r\n    he went to Kenmore, that he might ascend Ben Lawers in search of\r\n    some rare ferns.\r\n\r\n    In 1872 I saw him, after meeting Thomas Carlyle and Dean Stanley\r\n    at Linlathen, when Darwin's theory was much discussed, and when\r\n    our genial host--Mr. Erskine--talked so dispassionately but\r\n    decidedly against evolution as explanatory of the rise of what was\r\n    new. A little later in the same year Matthew Arnold discussed the\r\n    same subject with some friends at the Athenæum Club, defending the\r\n    chief aim of Darwin's theory, and enlarging from a different point\r\n    of view what Wallace had done in the same direction. I remember\r\n    well that he characterised the two men as fellow-workers, not as\r\n    followers, or in any sense as copyists. Wallace's versatility not\r\n    only continued, but grew in many ways with the advance of years.\r\n    It was seen in his appreciation of the value of historical study.\r\n    Quite late in life he wrote: \"The nineteenth century is quite as\r\n    wonderful in the domain of History as in that of Science.\"\r\n    Comparatively few know, or remember, that he and his young brother\r\n    Herbert--on whom he left an interesting chapter _in\r\n    memoriam_--both wrote verses, some of which were of real value.\r\n\r\n    It may be safely said that few scientific men have sympathetically\r\n    entered into bordering territories and therein excelled. The whole\r\n    field of psychical research was familiar to him, and he might have\r\n    been a leader in it.\r\n\r\n    My last meeting with him was at his final home, the \"Old Orchard,\"\r\n    Broadstone, in 1909. I was staying at Boscombe in Hants, and he\r\n    asked me to \"come and see his garden, while we talked of past\r\n    days.\" He had then the freshness of boyhood, blent with the mellow\r\n    wisdom of age.--W.A.K.\r\n\r\nThe eminent naturalist and traveller, Dr. Henry O. Forbes, who later\r\nexplored the greater part of the lands visited by Wallace, contributes\r\nthe following appreciation of the latter's scientific work:\r\n\r\n    As a traveller, explorer and working naturalist, Wallace will\r\n    always stand in the first rank, compared even with the most modern\r\n    explorers. It ought not to be forgotten, however, how great were\r\n    the difficulties, the dangers and the cost of travel fifty years\r\n    ago, compared with the facilities now enjoyed by his successors,\r\n    who can command steam and motor transport to wellnigh any spot on\r\n    the coasts of the globe, and who have to their hand concentrated\r\n    and preserved foods, a surer knowledge of the causes of tropical\r\n    diseases, and outfits of non-perishable medicines sufficient for\r\n    many years within the space of a few cubic inches. Commissariat\r\n    and health are the keys to all exploration in uncivilised regions.\r\n    Wallace accomplished his work on the shortest of commons and lay\r\n    weeks at a time sick through inability to replenish his medical\r\n    stores.\r\n\r\n    He was no mere \"trudger\" over new lands. Where those before him,\r\n    and even many after him, have been able to see only sterile\r\n    objects, his discerning eyes perceived everywhere a meaning in\r\n    the varying modes of organic life, and in response to his\r\n    sympathetic mind Nature revealed to him more of her multitudinous\r\n    secrets than to most others. Wallace's Amazonian travels were far\r\n    from unfruitful, in spite of the irreparable loss he sustained in\r\n    the burning of his notes and the bulk of his collections in the\r\n    vessel by which he was returning home; but it was in the Malay\r\n    Archipelago that his most celebrated years of investigation were\r\n    passed, which marked him as one of the greatest naturalists of our\r\n    time. As a methodical natural history collector--which is \"the\r\n    best sport in the world\" according to Darwin--he has never been\r\n    surpassed; and few naturalists, if any, have ever brought together\r\n    more enormous collections than he. The mere statement, taken from\r\n    his \"Malay Archipelago,\" of the number of his captures in the\r\n    Archipelago in six years of actual collecting, exceeding 125,000\r\n    specimens--a number greater than the entire contents of many large\r\n    museums--still causes amazement. The value of a collection,\r\n    however, depends on the full and accurate information attached to\r\n    each specimen, and from this point of view only a few collections,\r\n    including Darwin's and Bates's, have possessed the great\r\n    scientific value of his.\r\n\r\n    Wallace's Eastern explorations included nearly all the large and\r\n    the majority of the smaller islands of the Archipelago. Many of\r\n    them he was the first naturalist to visit, or to reside on. Ceram,\r\n    Batjian, Buru, Lombok, Timor, Aru, Ke and New Guinea had never\r\n    been previously scientifically investigated. When in 1858 \"the\r\n    first and greatest of the naturalists,\" as Dr. Wollaston styles\r\n    Wallace, visited New Guinea, it was \"the first time that any\r\n    European had ventured to reside alone and practically unprotected\r\n    on the mainland of this country,\" which, dangerous as it is now in\r\n    the same regions, was infinitely more so then. Of the journals of\r\n    his voyagings, \"The Malay Archipelago\" will always be ranked among\r\n    the greatest narratives of travel. The fact that this volume has\r\n    gone through a dozen editions is witness to its extraordinary\r\n    popularity among intelligent minds, and hardly supports the belief\r\n    that his scientific work has been forgotten. Nor can this\r\n    popularity be a matter of much surprise, for few travellers have\r\n    possessed Wallace's powers of exposition, his lucidity and charm\r\n    of style. Professor Strasburger of Bonn has declared that through\r\n    \"The Malay Archipelago\" \"a new world of scientific knowledge\" was\r\n    unfolded before him. \"I feel it  ... my duty,\" he adds, \"to\r\n    proclaim it with gratitude.\" Wallace's narrative has attracted\r\n    during the past half-century numerous naturalists to follow in his\r\n    tracks, many of whom have reaped rich aftermaths of his harvest;\r\n    but certain it is that no explorer in the same, if in any other,\r\n    region has approached his eminence, or attained the success he\r\n    achieved.\r\n\r\n    As a systematic zoologist, Wallace took no inconsiderable place;\r\n    his _métier_, however, was different. He described, nevertheless,\r\n    large sections of his Lepidoptera and of his birds, on which many\r\n    valuable papers are printed in the _Transactions_ of the learned\r\n    societies and in various scientific periodicals. Of the former,\r\n    special mention may be made of that on variation in the\r\n    \"Papilionidæ of the Malayan Region,\" of which Darwin has recorded:\r\n    \"I have never in my life been more struck by any paper.\" Of the\r\n    latter, reference may be drawn to his account of the \"Pigeons of\r\n    the Malay Archipelago\" and his paper on the \"Passerine Birds,\" in\r\n    which he proposed an important new arrangement of the families of\r\n    that group (used later in his \"Geographical Distribution\") based\r\n    on the feathering of their wings. Without a lengthy search through\r\n    the zoological records, it would be impossible to say how many\r\n    species Wallace added to science; but the constant recurrence in\r\n    the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum of \"wallacei\" as the\r\n    name bestowed on various new species by other systematists, and of\r\n    \"Wallace\" succeeding those scientifically named by himself, is an\r\n    excellent gauge of their very large number.\r\n\r\n    In the field of anthropology Wallace could never be an\r\n    uninterested spectator. He took a deep interest, he tells us, in\r\n    the study of the various races of mankind. His accounts of the\r\n    Amazonian tribes suffered greatly by the loss of his journals; but\r\n    of the peoples of the Malay Archipelago he has given us a most\r\n    interesting narrative, detailing their bodily and mental\r\n    characteristics, and showing how their distribution accorded with\r\n    that of the fauna on the opposite sides--Malays to the West,\r\n    Papuans to the East--of Wallace's Line. If fuller investigation of\r\n    the New Guinea tribes requires some modification in regard to\r\n    their origin, his observations, as broadly outlined then, remain\r\n    true still. His opinions on the origin of the Australian\r\n    aborigines--that they were a low and primitive type of Caucasian\r\n    race--which, when first promulgated, were somewhat sceptically\r\n    received, are now those accepted by many very competent\r\n    anthropologists.\r\n\r\n    Wallace's contributions to Geographical Science were only second\r\n    in importance to those he so pre-eminently made to biology. Though\r\n    skilled in the use of surveying instruments, he did little or no\r\n    map-making--at all times a laborious and lengthy task--for, with\r\n    more important purposes in his mind, he could not spare the time,\r\n    nor did the limitations to his movements permit any useful\r\n    attempt. Yet he did pure geographical work quite as important. The\r\n    value of the comparative study of the flora and fauna of\r\n    neighbouring regions, the great differences in the midst of much\r\n    likeness between the organic life of neighbouring land masses, was\r\n    a subject that was always in Wallace's mind during his exploration\r\n    of the Amazon Valley, for he perceived that the physical geography\r\n    and the distribution of these animals and plants were of the\r\n    greatest service in elucidating their history where the geological\r\n    record was defective. As is well known, the visual inspection of\r\n    the geological structure of tropical countries is always difficult\r\n    and often impossible to make out because of the dense vegetation\r\n    upon the surface and even the faces of the river gorges. But for\r\n    the loss of his collections and notes we should have had from\r\n    Wallace's pen a Physical History of the Amazon. This loss was,\r\n    however, amply made up by his very original contributions to the\r\n    geography of the Malay Archipelago. \"The Zoological Geography of\r\n    the Malay Archipelago\" and \"The Physical Geography of the Malay\r\n    Archipelago\" (written on Eastern soil, with the texts of his\r\n    discourses around him) were the forerunners of his monumental\r\n    \"Geographical Distribution of Animals,\" elaborated in England\r\n    after his return. \"To the publication of the 'Geographical\r\n    Distribution of Animals' we owe the first scientific study of the\r\n    distribution of organic life on the globe, which has broadened\r\n    ever since, and continues to interest students daily; his\r\n    brilliant work in Natural History and Geography  ... is universally\r\n    honoured,\" are the opinions of Dr. Scott speaking as President of\r\n    the Linnean Society of London.\r\n\r\n    One of Wallace's most important contributions to the physical\r\n    geography of the Malay region was his discovery of the physical\r\n    differences between the western and the eastern portions of the\r\n    Archipelago; i.e. that the islands lying to the east of a line\r\n    running north from the middle of the Straits of Bali and outside\r\n    Celebes were fragments of an ancient and larger Australian\r\n    continent, while those to the western side were fragments of an\r\n    Asiatic continent. This he elucidated by recognising that the\r\n    flora and fauna on the two sides of the line, close though these\r\n    islands approached each other, were absolutely different and had\r\n    remained for ages uncommingled. This line was denominated\r\n    \"Wallace's Line\" by Huxley, and this discovery alone would have\r\n    been sufficient to associate his name inseparably with this region\r\n    of the globe.--H.O.F.\r\n\r\nLike Darwin, Wallace gave excessive attention to the suggestions and\r\ncriticisms of people who were obviously ignorant of the subjects about\r\nwhich they wrote. He was never impatient with honest ignorance or\r\nconsidered the lowly position of his correspondents. He replied to all\r\nletters of inquiry (and he received many from working men), and always\r\ngave his best knowledge and advice to anyone who desired it. There was\r\nnot the faintest suggestion of the despicable sense of superiority about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I had, of course, revelled in 'The Malay Archipelago' when a boy,\" says\r\nProf. Cockerell, \"but my first personal relations with Dr. Wallace arose\r\nfrom a letter I wrote him after reading his 'Darwinism,' then (early in\r\n1890) recently published. The book delighted me, but I found a number of\r\nlittle matters to criticise and discuss, and with the impetuosity of\r\nyouth proceeded to write to the author, and also to send a letter on\r\nsome of the points to _Nature_. I have possibly not yet reached years of\r\ndiscretion, but in the perspective of time I can see with confusion that\r\nwhat I regarded as worthy zeal might well have been characterised by\r\nothers as confounded impudence. In the face of this, the tolerance and\r\nkindness of Dr. Wallace's reply is wholly characteristic: 'I am very\r\nmuch obliged to you for your letter containing so many valuable\r\nemendations and suggestions on my \"Darwinism.\" They will be very useful\r\nto me in preparing another edition. Living in the country with but few\r\nbooks, I have often been unable to obtain the _latest_ information, but\r\nfor the purpose of the argument the facts of a few years back are often\r\nas good as those of to-day--which in their turn will be modified a few\r\nyears hence.... You appear to have so much knowledge of details in so\r\nmany branches of natural history, and also to have thought so much on\r\nmany of the more recondite problems, that I shall be much pleased to\r\nreceive any further remarks or corrections on any other portions of my\r\nbook.' This letter, written to a very young and quite unknown man in the\r\nwilds of Colorado, who had merely communicated a list of more or less\r\ntrifling criticisms, can only be explained as an instance of Dr.\r\nWallace's eagerness to help and encourage beginners. It did not occur to\r\nhim to question the propriety of the criticisms, he did not write as a\r\nsuperior to an inferior; he only saw what seemed to him a spark of\r\nbiological enthusiasm, which should by all means be kindled into flame.\r\nMany years later, when I was at his house, he produced with the greatest\r\ndelight some letters from a young man who had gone to South America and\r\nwas getting his first glimpse of the tropical forest. What discoveries\r\nhe might make! What joy he must have on seeing the things described in\r\nthe letter, such things as Dr. Wallace himself had seen in Brazil so\r\nlong ago!\"\r\n\r\nWallace's critical faculty was always keen and vigilant. Unlike some\r\ncritics, however, he relished genuine and well-informed criticism of his\r\nown writings. Flattery he despised; whilst the charge of dishonesty\r\naroused strongest resentment. Deceived he might be, but he required\r\nclear proof that his own eyes and ears had led him astray. Romanes, who\r\nhad propounded the forgotten theory of physiological selection, charged\r\nWallace with adopting it as his own. This was not only untrue, it was\r\nridiculous; and Wallace, after telling him so and receiving no apology,\r\ndropped him out of his recognition. During Romanes' illness Mr.\r\nThiselton-Dyer wrote to Wallace and sought to bring about a\r\nreconciliation, and Wallace replied:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Parkstone, Dorset. September 26, 1893._\r\n\r\nMy dear Thiselton-Dyer,--I am sorry to hear of Romanes' illness, because\r\nI think he would have done much good work in carrying out experiments\r\nwhich require the leisure, means and knowledge which he possesses. I\r\ncannot, however, at all understand his wishing to have any communication\r\nfrom myself. I do not think I ever met Romanes in private more than\r\nonce, when he called on me more than twenty years ago about some curious\r\npsychical phenomena occurring in his own family; and perhaps half a\r\ndozen letters--if so many--may have passed between us since. There is\r\ntherefore no question of personal friendship disturbed. I consider,\r\nhowever, that he made a very gross misstatement and personal attack on\r\nme when he stated, both in English and American periodicals, that in my\r\n\"Darwinism\" I adopted his theory of \"physiological selection\" and\r\nclaimed it as my own, and that my adoption of it was \"unequivocal and\r\ncomplete.\" This accusation he supported by such a flood of words and\r\nquotations and explanations as to obscure all the chief issues and\r\nrender it almost impossible for the ordinary reader to disentangle the\r\nfacts. I told him then that unless he withdrew this accusation as\r\npublicly as he had made it I should decline all future correspondence\r\nwith him, and should avoid referring to him in any of my writings.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, very different from any criticism of my theories;\r\nthat, or even ridicule, would never disturb me; but when a man has made\r\nan accusation of literary and scientific dishonesty, and has done all he\r\ncan to spread this accusation over the whole civilised world, my only\r\nanswer can be--after showing, as I have done (_see Nature_, vol. xliii.,\r\npp. 79 and 150), that his accusations are wholly untrue--to ignore his\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe that he can want any sympathy from a man he says has\r\nwilfully and grossly plagiarised him, unless he feels that his\r\naccusations were unfounded. If he does so, and will write to me to that\r\neffect (for publication, if I wish, after his death), I will accept it\r\nas full reparation and write him such a letter as you suggest.--Believe\r\nme yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR W.T. THISELTON-DYER TO A.R. WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kew. September 27, 1897._\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wallace,--I am afraid I have been rather guilty of an\r\nimpertinence which I hope you will forgive.\r\n\r\nRomanes is an old acquaintance of mine of many years' standing.\r\nPersonally, I like him very much; but for his writings I confess I have\r\nno great admiration.\r\n\r\nPray believe me I had no mission of any sort on his part to write to\r\nyou. But I feel so sorry for him that when he told me how much he\r\nregretted that he did not stand well with you, I could not resist\r\nwriting to tell you of the calamities that have befallen him.\r\n\r\nI must confess I was in total ignorance of what you tell me. I don't\r\nsee how, under the circumstances, you can do anything. I was never more\r\nsurprised in my life, in fact, than when I read your letter. The whole\r\nthing is too childishly preposterous.\r\n\r\nRomanes laments over _me_ because he says I wilfully misunderstand his\r\ntheory. The fact is, poor fellow, that I do not think he understands it\r\nhimself. If his life had been destined to be prolonged I should have\r\ndone all in my power to have induced him to occupy himself more with\r\nobservation and less with mere logomachy.\r\n\r\nI cannot get him to face the fact that natural hybrids are being found\r\nto be more and more common amongst plants. At the beginning of the\r\ncentury it was supposed that there were some sixty recognisable species\r\nof willows in the British Isles: now they are cut down to about sixteen,\r\nand all the rest are resolved into hybrids.--Ever sincerely,\r\n\r\nW.T. THISELTON-DYER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWallace was a seeker after Truth who was never shy of his august\r\nmistress, whatever robes she wore. \"I feel within me,\" wrote Darwin to\r\nHenslow, \"an instinct for truth, or knowledge, or discovery, of\r\nsomething of the same nature as the instinct of virtue.\" This was\r\nequally true of Wallace. He had a fine reverence for truth, beauty and\r\nlove, and he feared not to expose error. He paid no respect to\r\ntime-honoured practices and opinions if he believed them to be false.\r\nVaccination came under his searching criticism, and in the face of\r\nnearly the whole medical faculty he denounced it as quackery condemned\r\nby the very evidence used to defend it. He very carefully examined the\r\nclaims of phrenology, which had been laughed out of court by scientific\r\nmen, and he came to the conclusion that \"in the present (twentieth)\r\ncentury phrenology will assuredly attain general acceptance. It will\r\nprove itself to be the true science of the mind. Its practical uses in\r\neducation, in self-discipline, in the reformatory treatment of\r\ncriminals, and in the remedial treatment of the insane, will gain it\r\none of the highest places in the hierarchy of the sciences; and its\r\npersistent neglect and obloquy during the last sixty years of the\r\nnineteenth century will be referred to as an example of the almost\r\nincredible narrowness and prejudice which prevailed among men of science\r\nat the very time they were making such splendid advances in other fields\r\nof thought and discovery.\"[67]\r\n\r\nWallace was not even scared out of his wits by ghosts, for, unlike\r\nColeridge, he believed in them although he thought he had seen many.\r\nWhether truth came from the scaffold or the throne, the séance or the\r\nsky, it did not alter the truth, and did not prejudice or overbear his\r\njudgment. He shed his early materialism (which temporarily took\r\npossession of him as it did of many others as a result of the shock\r\nfollowing the overwhelming discoveries of that period) when he was\r\nbrought face to face with the phenomena of the spiritual kingdom which\r\nwithstood the searching test of his keen observation and reasoning\r\npowers. Prejudices, preconceived notions, respect for his scientific\r\nposition or the opinions of his eminent friends or the reputation of the\r\nlearned societies to which he belonged--all were quietly and firmly put\r\naside when he saw what he recognised to be the truth. If his\r\nfellow-workers did not accept it, so much the worse for them. He stood\r\nfour-square against the onslaught of quasi-scientific rationalism, which\r\nonce threatened to obliterate all the ancient landmarks of morality and\r\nreligion alike. He made mistakes, and he admitted and corrected them,\r\nbecause he verily loved Truth for her own sake. And to the very end of\r\nhis long life he kept the windows of his soul wide open to what he\r\nbelieved to be the light of this and other worlds.\r\n\r\nHe was, then, a man of lofty ideals, and his idealism was at the base\r\nof his opposition to the materialism which boasted that Natural\r\nSelection explained all adaptation, and that Physics could give the\r\nsolution of Huxley's poser to Spencer: \"Given the molecular forces in a\r\nmutton chop, deduce Hamlet and Faust therefrom,\" and which regarded mind\r\nas a quality of matter as brightness is a quality of steel, and life as\r\nthe result of the organisation of matter and not its cause.\r\n\r\n\"We have ourselves,\" wrote Prof. H.F. Osborn in an account of Wallace's\r\nscientific work which Wallace praised, \"experienced a loss of confidence\r\nwith advancing years, an increasing humility in the face of\r\ntransformations which become more and more mysterious the more we study\r\nthem, although we may not join with this master in his appeal to an\r\norganising and directing principle.\" But profound contemplation of\r\nnature and of the mind of man led Wallace to belief in God, to accept\r\nthe Divine origin of life and consciousness, and to proclaim a hierarchy\r\nof spiritual beings presiding over nature and the affairs of nations.\r\n\"Whatever,\" writes Dr. H.O. Forbes, \"may be the last words on the deep\r\nand mysterious problems to which Wallace addressed himself in his later\r\nworks, the unquestioned consensus of the highest scientific opinion\r\nthroughout the world is that his work has been for more than half a\r\ncentury, and will continue to be, a living stimulus to interpretation\r\nand investigation, a fertilising and vivifying force in every sphere of\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unprofitable to go further than in previous chapters into\r\nhis so-called heresies--political, scientific or religious. Yet we may\r\nimitate his boldness and ask whether he was not, perhaps, in advance of\r\nhis age and whether his heresies were not shrewd anticipations of some\r\ntruth at present but partially revealed. Take the example of\r\nSpiritualism, which, I suppose, has more opponents than\r\nanti-vaccination. No one can overlook the fact that Spiritualism has\r\nmany scientific exponents--Myers, Crookes, Lodge, Barrett and others.\r\nPrejudices against Spiritualism are as unscientific as the credulity\r\nwhich swallows the mutterings of every medium. Podmore's two ponderous\r\nvolumes on the History of Spritualism are marred by an obvious anxiety\r\nto make the very least, if not the very worst, of every phenomenon\r\nalleged to be spiritualistic. That kind of deliberate and obstinate\r\nblindness which prided itself on being the clear cold light of science\r\nWallace scorned and denounced. He did not insist upon spiritualistic\r\nmanifestations shaping themselves according to his own predesigned\r\nmoulds in order to be investigated. He watched for facts whatever form\r\nthey assumed. He fully recognised that the phenomena he saw and heard\r\ncould be easily ridiculed, but behind them he as fully believed that he\r\ncame into contact with spiritual realities which remain, and which led\r\nhim to other explanations of the higher faculties of man and the origin\r\nof life and consciousness than were acceptable to the materialistic\r\nfollowers of Haeckel, Büchner and Huxley. And who dares dogmatically to\r\nassert in the name of science and in the second decade of the twentieth\r\ncentury, when the deeper meanings of evolution are being revealed, and\r\nthe philosophy of Bergson is spoken about on the housetops, that he was\r\nwrong? In these views may he not become the peer of Darwin?\r\n\r\nAt first blush it may seem to be a bad example of special pleading to\r\nattempt to discover the reason for his opposition to vaccination in his\r\nidealism. But it is not far from the truth. He believed in a Ministry of\r\nPublic Health, that doctors should be servants of the State, and that\r\nthey should be paid according as they kept people well and not ill.\r\nHealth is the natural condition of the human body when it is properly\r\nsustained and used. And chemicals, even in sickness, are of less\r\nimportance than fresh air, light and proper food. He ridiculed, too, the\r\nnotion of unhealthy places. \"It is like,\" he wrote to Mr. Birch, \"the\r\nold idea that every child must have measles, and the sooner the better.\"\r\nTo the same correspondent, who was contemplating going into virgin\r\nforests and who expressed his fear of malaria, he replied: \"There is no\r\nspecial danger of malaria or other diseases in a dense forest region. I\r\nam sure this is a delusion, and the dense virgin forests, even when\r\nswampy, are, in a state of nature, perfectly healthy to live in. It is\r\nman's tampering with them, and man's own bad habits of living, that\r\nrender them unhealthy. Having now gone over all Spruce's journals and\r\nletters during his twelve years' life in and about the Amazonian\r\nforests, I am sure this is so. And even where a place is said to be\r\nnotoriously 'malarious,' it is mostly due not to infection only but to\r\npredisposition due to malnutrition or some bad mode of living. A person\r\nliving healthily may, for the most part, laugh at such terrors. Neither\r\nI nor Spruce ever got fevers when we lived in the forests and were able\r\nto get wholesome food.\" \"Health,\" he said to the present writer, \"is the\r\nbest resistant to disease, and not the artificial giving of a mild form\r\nof a disease in order to render the body immune to it for a season.\r\nVaccination is not only condemned upon the statistics which are used to\r\nuphold it, but it is a false principle--unscientific, and therefore\r\ndoomed to fail in the end.\" Besides which, he believed in mental\r\nhealing, and had recorded definite and certain benefit from spiritual\r\n\"healers.\" And he reminded himself that amongst doctors (witness the\r\nblind opposition encountered by Lister's discoveries) were found from\r\ntime to time not a few enemies of the true healing art, and obstinate\r\ndefenders of many forms of quackery. Wallace made no claim to be an\r\noriginal investigator. He knew his limitations, and said again and again\r\nthat he could not have conducted the slow and minute researches or have\r\naccumulated the vast amount of detailed evidence to which Darwin, with\r\ninfinite patience, devoted his life. He was genuinely glad that it had\r\nnot fallen to his lot to write \"The Origin of Species.\" He felt that his\r\nchief faculty was to reason from facts which others discovered. Yet he\r\nhad that original insight and creative faculty which enabled him to see,\r\noften as by flashlight, the explanation which had remained hidden from\r\nthe eyes of the man who was most familiar with the particular facts, and\r\nhe elaborated it with quickening pulse, anxious to put down the whole\r\nconception which filled his mind lest some portion of it should escape\r\nhim. Therein lay one secret of his great genius. He often said that he\r\nwas an idler, but we know that he was a patient and industrious worker.\r\nHis idleness was his way of describing his long musings, waiting the\r\nbidding of her whom God inspires--Truth, who often hides her face from\r\nthe clouded eyes of man. For hours, days, weeks, he was disinclined to\r\nwork. He felt no constraining impulse, his attention was relaxed or\r\nengaged upon a novel, or his seeds, or the plan of a new house, which\r\nalways excited his interest. Then, apparently suddenly, whilst in one of\r\nhis day-dreams, or in a fever (as at Ternate, to recall the historical\r\nepisode when the theory of Natural Selection struck him), an\r\nexplanation, a theory, a discovery,[68] the plan of a new book, came to\r\nhim like a flash of light, and with the plan the material, the\r\narguments, the illustrations; the words came tumbling one over the\r\nother in his brain, and as suddenly his idleness vanished, and work,\r\neager, prolonged, unwearying, filled his days and months and years until\r\nthe message was written down and the task fully accomplished. Whilst\r\nwriting he referred to few books, but wrote straight on, adding\r\nparagraph to paragraph, chapter to chapter, without recasting or\r\nrevision.[69] And the result was fresh, striking, original. It was a\r\ncreation. The work being done, he relapsed into his busy idleness. The\r\ntruth, as he saw it, seemed to come to him. Some people called him a\r\nprophet, but he was not conscious of that high calling. I do not\r\nremember him saying that he was only a messenger. Perhaps later, when he\r\nwas reviewing his life, he connected his sudden inspirations with a\r\nhigher source, but for their realisation he relied upon a foundation of\r\nveritable facts, facts patiently accumulated, a foundation laid broad\r\nand deep. He had the vision of the prophet allied with the wisdom of the\r\nphilosopher and the calm mental detachment of the man of science.\r\nPerhaps another explanation of his genius may be found in his\r\nopen-mindedness. Truth found ready access to his conscience, and always\r\na warm welcome, and he saw with open eyes where others were stone-blind.\r\n\r\nHe belonged to our common humanity. No caste or acquired pride or\r\nunapproachable intellectualism cut him off from the people. His simple\r\nhumanness made him one with us all. And his humanity was singularly\r\ncomprehensive. It led him, for instance, to investigate the subject of\r\nsuffering in animals. He noticed that all good men and women rightly\r\nshrank from giving pain to them, and he set himself to prove that the\r\ncapacity for pain decreased as we descended the scale of life, and that\r\npoets and others were mistaken when they imputed acute suffering to the\r\nlower creation, because of the very restricted response of their nervous\r\nsystem. Even in the case of the human infant, he concluded that only\r\nvery slight sensations are at first required, and that such only are\r\ntherefore developed. The sensation of pain does not, probably, reach its\r\nmaximum till the whole organism is fully developed in the adult\r\nindividual. \"This,\" he added, with that characteristic touch which made\r\nhim kin to all oppressed people, \"is rather comforting in view of the\r\nsufferings of so many infants needlessly sacrificed through the terrible\r\ndefects of our vicious social system.\"\r\n\r\nTo Wallace pain was the birth-cry of a soul's advance--the stamp of rank\r\nin nature is capacity for pain. Pain, he held, was always strictly\r\nsubordinated to the law of utility, and was never developed beyond what\r\nwas actually needed for the protection and advance of life. This brings\r\nthe sensitive soul immense relief. Our susceptibility to the higher\r\nagonies is a condition of our advance in life's pageant.\r\n\r\nTake another instance. Amongst his numerous correspondents there were\r\nnot a few who decided not to take life, for food, or science, or in war.\r\nOne young man who went out with the assistance of Wallace to Trinidad\r\nand Brazil to become a naturalist, and to whom he wrote many letters[70]\r\nof direction and encouragement, gave up the work of collecting--to\r\nWallace's sincere disappointment--and came home because he felt that it\r\nwas wrong to take the lives of such wondrous and beautiful birds and\r\ninsects. Another correspondent, who had joined the Navy, wrote a number\r\nof long letters to Wallace setting forth his conscientious objections to\r\nkilling, arrived at after reading Wallace's books; and although Wallace\r\nendeavoured from prudential considerations to restrain him from giving\r\nup his position, he nevertheless wholly sympathised with him and in the\r\nend warmly defended him when it was necessary to do so. The sacrifice,\r\ntoo, of human life in dangerous employments for the purpose of financial\r\ngain, no less than the frightful slaughter of the battlefield, was\r\nabhorrent to Wallace and aroused his intensest indignation. Life to him\r\nwas sacred. It had its origin in the spiritual kingdom. \"We are lovers\r\nof nature, from 'bugs' up to 'humans,'\" he wrote to Mr. Fred Birch.\r\n\r\nBy every means he laboured earnestly to secure an equal opportunity of\r\nleading a useful and happy life for all men and women. He championed the\r\ncause of women--of their freer life and their more active and public\r\npart in national service. He found the selective agency, which was to\r\nwork for the amelioration he desired, in a higher form of sexual\r\nselection, which will be the prerogative of women; and therefore woman's\r\nposition in the not distant future \"will be far higher and more\r\nimportant than any which has been claimed for or by her in the past.\"\r\nWhen political and social rights are conceded to her on equality with\r\nmen, her free choice in marriage, no longer influenced by economic and\r\nsocial considerations, will guide the future moral progress of the race,\r\nrestore the lost equality of opportunity to every child born in our\r\ncountry, and secure the balance between the sexes. \"It will be their\r\n(women's) special duty so to mould public opinion, through home training\r\nand social influence, as to render the women of the future the\r\nregenerators of the entire human race.\"\r\n\r\nHe was acutely anxious that his ideals should be realised on earth by\r\nthe masses of the people. He had a large and noble vision of their\r\nfuture. And he had his plan for their immediate redemption--national\r\nownership of the soil, better housing, higher wages, certainty of\r\nemployment, abolition of preventable diseases, more leisure and wider\r\neducation, not merely for the practical work of obtaining a livelihood\r\nbut to enable them to enjoy art and literature and song. His opposition\r\nto Eugenics (to adopt the word introduced by Galton, which Wallace\r\ncalled jargon) sprang from his idealism and his love of the people, as\r\nwell as from his scientific knowledge. On the social side he thought\r\nthat Eugenics offered less chance of a much-needed improvement of\r\nenvironment than the social reforms which he advocated, whilst on the\r\nscientific side he believed that the attempt, with our extremely limited\r\nknowledge, to breed men and women by artificial selection was worse than\r\nfolly. He feared that, as he understood it, Eugenics would perpetuate\r\nclass distinctions, and postpone social reform, and afford\r\nquasi-scientific excuses for keeping people \"in the positions Nature\r\nintended them to occupy,\" a scientific reading of the more offensive\r\nsaying of those who, having plenty themselves, believe that it is for\r\nthe good of the lower classes to be dependent upon others. \"Clear up,\"\r\nhe said to the present writer one day, when we drifted into a warm\r\ndiscussion of the teachings of Eugenists; \"change the environment so\r\nthat all may have an adequate opportunity of living a useful and happy\r\nlife, and give woman a free choke in marriage; and when that has been\r\ngoing on for some generations you may be in a better position to apply\r\nwhatever has been discovered about heredity and human breeding, and you\r\nmay then know which are the better stocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Segregation of the unfit,\" he remarked to an interviewer after the\r\nEugenic Conference, at which much was unhappily said that wholly\r\njustified his caustic denunciation, \"is a mere excuse for establishing\r\na medical tyranny. And we have enough of this kind of tyranny already\r\n... the world does not want the eugenist to set it straight.... Eugenics\r\nis simply the meddlesome interference of an arrogant scientific\r\npriestcraft.\"\r\n\r\nThus his radicalism and his so-called fads were born of his high\r\naspirations. He was not the recluse calmly spinning theories from a\r\nbewildering chaos of observations, and building up isolated facts into\r\nthe unity of a great and illuminating conception in the silence and\r\nsolitude of his library, unmindful of the great world of sin and sorrow\r\nwithout. He could say with Darwin, \"I was born a naturalist\"; but we can\r\nadd that his heart was on fire with love for the toiling masses. He had\r\nfelt the intense joy of discovering a vast and splendid generalisation,\r\nwhich not only worked a complete revolution in biological science, but\r\nhas also illuminated the whole field of human knowledge. Yet his\r\ngreatest ambition was to improve the cruel conditions under which\r\nthousands of his fellow-creatures suffered and died, and to make their\r\nlives sweeter and happier. His mind was great enough and his heart large\r\nenough to encompass all that lies between the visible horizons of human\r\nthought and activity, and even in his old age he lived upon the topmost\r\npeaks, eagerly looking for the horizon beyond. In the words of the late\r\nMr. Gladstone, he \"was inspired with the belief that life was a great\r\nand noble calling; not a mean and grovelling thing that we are to\r\nshuffle through as we can, but an elevated and lofty destiny.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut we must not be tempted into further disquisition. As he grew older\r\nthe public Press as well as his friends celebrated his birthdays.\r\nCongratulations by telegram and letter poured in upon him and gave him\r\ngreat pleasure. Minor poets sang special solos, or joined in the\r\nchorus. One example may be quoted:\r\n\r\n  ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE\r\n\r\n  8TH JANUARY, 1911\r\n\r\n  A little cot back'd by a wood-fring'd height,\r\n      Where sylvan Usk runs swiftly babbling by:\r\n      Here thy young eyes first look'd on earth and sky,\r\n  And all the wonders of the day and night;\r\n  O born interpreter of Nature's might,\r\n      Lord of the quiet heart and seeing eye,\r\n      Vast is our debt to thee we'll ne'er deny,\r\n  Though some may own it in their own despite.\r\n  Now after fourscore teeming years and seven,\r\n      Our hearts are jocund that we have thee still\r\n      A refuge in this world of good and ill,\r\n  When evil triumphs and our souls are riv'n;\r\n  A friend to all the friendless under heav'n;\r\n  A foe to fraud and all the lusts that kill.\r\n\r\n  O champion of the Truth, whate'er it be!\r\n      World-wand'rer over this terrestrial frame;\r\n      Twin-named with Darwin on the roll of fame;\r\n  This day we render homage unto thee;\r\n  For in thy steps o'er alien land and sea,\r\n      Where life burns fast and tropic splendours flame.\r\n      Oft have we follow'd with sincere acclaim\r\n  To mark thee unfold Nature's mystery.\r\n  For this we thank thee, yet one thing remains\r\n      Shall shrine thee deeper in the heart of man,\r\n      In ages yet to be when we are dust;\r\n  Thou hast put forth thy hand to rend our chains,\r\n      Our birthright to restore from feudal ban;\r\n      O righteous soul, magnanimous and just!\r\n\r\n  W. BRAUNSTON JONES.\r\n\r\nSir William Barrett, one of Wallace's oldest friends, visited him during\r\nthe last year of his life, and thus describes the visit:\r\n\r\n    In the early summer of 1913, some six months before his death, I\r\n    had the pleasure of paying another visit and spending a delightful\r\n    afternoon with my old friend. His health was failing, and he sat\r\n    wrapped up before a fire in his study, though it was a warm day.\r\n    He could not walk round his garden with me as before, but pointed\r\n    to the little plot of ground in front of the French windows of his\r\n    study--where he had moved some of his rarer primulas and other\r\n    plants he was engaged in hybridising--and which he could just\r\n    manage to visit. His eyesight and hearing seemed as good as ever,\r\n    and his intellectual power was undimmed....\r\n\r\n    Dr. Wallace then, pointing to the beautiful expanse of garden,\r\n    woodland and sea which was visible from the large study windows,\r\n    burst forth with vigorous gesticulation and flashing eyes: \"Just\r\n    think! All this wonderful beauty and diversity of nature results\r\n    from the operation of a few simple laws. In my early unregenerate\r\n    days I used to think that only material forces and natural laws\r\n    were operative throughout the world. But these I now see are\r\n    hopelessly inadequate to explain this mystery and wonder and\r\n    variety of life. I am, as you know, absolutely convinced that\r\n    behind and beyond all elementary processes there is a guiding and\r\n    directive force; a Divine power or hierarchy of powers, ever\r\n    controlling these processes so that they are tending to more\r\n    abundant and to higher types of life.\"\r\n\r\n    This led Dr. Wallace to refer to my published lecture on \"Creative\r\n    Thought\" and express his hearty concurrence with the line of\r\n    argument therein; in fact he had already sent me his views, which,\r\n    with his consent, I published as a postscript to that lecture.\r\n\r\n    Then our conversation turned upon recent political events, and it\r\n    was remarkable how closely he had followed, and how heartily he\r\n    approved, the legislation of the Liberal Government of the day.\r\n    His admiration for Mr. Lloyd George was unfeigned. \"To think that\r\n    I should have lived to see so earnest and democratic a Chancellor\r\n    of the Exchequer!\" he exclaimed, and he confidently awaited still\r\n    larger measures which would raise the condition of the workers to\r\n    a higher level; and nothing was more striking than his intense\r\n    sympathy with every movement for the relief of poverty and the\r\n    betterment of the wage-earning classes. The land question, we\r\n    agreed, lay at the root of the matter, and land nationalisation\r\n    the true solution. In fact, ever since I read the proof-sheets of\r\n    his book on this subject, which he corrected when staying at my\r\n    house in Kingstown, I have been a member of the Land\r\n    Nationalisation Society, of which he was President.\r\n\r\n    Needless to say, Dr. Wallace was an ardent Home Ruler and Free\r\n    Trader,[71] but on the latter question he said there should be an\r\n    export duty on coal, especially the South Wales steam coal, as our\r\n    supply was limited and it was essential for the prosperity of the\r\n    country--and \"the purchaser pays the duty,\" he remarked. I\r\n    heartily agreed with him, and said that a small export duty _had_\r\n    been placed on coal by the Conservative Government, but\r\n    subsequently was removed. This he had forgotten, and when later on\r\n    I sent him particulars of the duty and its yield, he replied\r\n    saying that at that time he was so busy with the preparation of a\r\n    book that he had overlooked the fact. He wrote most energetically\r\n    on the importance of the Government being wise in time, and urged\r\n    at least a 2s. export duty on coal.\r\n\r\n    We talked about the question of a portrait of Dr. Wallace being\r\n    painted and presented to the Royal Society, which had been\r\n    suggested by the Rev. James Marchant, to whom Dr. Wallace\r\n    referred, when talking to me, in grateful and glowing\r\n    terms.--W.F.B.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it should be added to Sir William Barrett's reminiscences that\r\nthe movement which was set on foot to carry out this project was stayed\r\nby Wallace's death.\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of his life his pen was seldom dry. His interest\r\nin science and in politics was fresh and keen to the closing week. He\r\nwrote \"Social Environment and Moral Progress\" in 1912, at the age of 90.\r\nThe book had a remarkable reception. Leading articles and illustrated\r\nreviews appeared in most of the daily newspapers. The book, into which\r\nhe had put his deepest thoughts and feelings upon the condition of\r\nsociety, was hailed as a virile and notable production from a truly\r\ngreat man. After this was issued, he saw another, \"The Revolt of\r\nDemocracy,\" through the press. But this did not exhaust his activities.\r\nHe entered almost immediately into a contract to write a big volume upon\r\nthe social order, and as a side issue to help, as is mentioned in the\r\nIntroduction, in the production of an even larger book upon the writings\r\nand position of Darwin and Wallace and the theory of Natural Selection\r\nas an adequate explanation of organic evolution. Age did not seem to\r\nweaken his amazing fertility of creative thought, nor to render him less\r\nsusceptible to the claims of humanity, which he faced with a noble\r\ncourage. In nobility of character and in magnitude, variety and richness\r\nof mind he was amongst the foremost scientific men of the Victorian Age,\r\nand with his death that great period, which was marked by wide and\r\nilluminating generalisations and the grand style in science, came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nApart altogether, however, from his scientific position and attainments,\r\nwhich set him on high, he was a noble example of brave, resolute, and\r\nhopeful endeavour, maintained without faltering to the end of a long\r\nlife. And this is not the least valuable part of his legacy to the race.\r\n\r\nWhen Henslow died, Huxley wrote to Hooker: \"He had intellect to\r\ncomprehend his highest duty distinctly, and force of character to do it;\r\nwhich of us dare ask for a higher summary of his life than that? For\r\nsuch a man there can be no fear in facing the great unknown; his life\r\nhas been one long experience of the substantial justice of the laws by\r\nwhich this world is governed, and he will calmly trust to them still as\r\nhe lays his head down for his long sleep.\" Let that also stand as the\r\nestimate of Wallace by his contemporaries, an estimate which we believe\r\nposterity will confirm. And to it we may add that death, which came to\r\nhim in his sleep as a gentle deliverer, opened the door into the larger\r\nand fuller life into which he tried to penetrate and in which he firmly\r\nbelieved. If that faith be founded in truth, Darwin and Wallace, yonder\r\nas here, are united evermore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am writing these concluding words on the second anniversary of his\r\ndeath. Before me there lies the telegram which brought me the sad news\r\nthat he had \"passed away very peacefully at 9.25 a.m., without regaining\r\nconsciousness.\" He was in his ninety-first year. It was suggested that\r\nhe should be buried in Westminster Abbey, beside Charles Darwin, but\r\nMrs. Wallace and the family, expressing his own wishes as well as\r\ntheirs, did not desire it. On Monday, November 10th, he was laid to rest\r\nwith touching simplicity in the little cemetery of Broadstone, on a\r\npine-clad hill swept by ocean breezes. He was followed on his last\r\nearthly journey by his son and daughter, by Miss Mitten, his\r\nsister-in-law, and by the present writer. Mrs. Wallace, being an\r\ninvalid, was unable to attend. The funeral service was conducted by the\r\nBishop of Salisbury (Dr. Ridgeway), and among the official\r\nrepresentatives were Prof. Raphael Meldola and Prof. E.B. Poulton\r\nrepresenting the Royal Society; the latter and Dr. Scott representing\r\nthe Linnean Society, and Mr. Joseph Hyder the Land Nationalisation\r\nSociety. A singularly appropriate monument, consisting of a fossil\r\ntree-trunk from the Portland beds, has been erected over his grave upon\r\na base of Purbeck stone, which bears the following inscription:\r\n\r\n  ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE, O.M.\r\n  Born Jan. 8th, 1823, Died Nov. 7th, 1913\r\n\r\nA year later, on the 10th of December, 1914, his widow died after a long\r\nillness, and was buried in the same grave. She was the eldest daughter\r\nof Mr. William Mitten, of Hurstpierpoint, an enthusiastic botanist, and\r\nin no mean degree she inherited her father's love of wild flowers and of\r\nthe beautiful in nature. It was this similarity of tastes which led to\r\nher close intimacy and subsequent marriage, in 1866, with Wallace. Their\r\nmarried life was an exceedingly happy one. She was able to help him in\r\nhis scientific labours, and she provided that atmosphere in the home\r\nlife which enabled him to devote himself to his many-sided enterprises.\r\nAnd nothing would give him more joy than to know that this book is\r\ndedicated to her memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAVE OF ALFRED RUSSEL AND ANNIE WALLACE]\r\n\r\nSoon after Wallace's death a Committee was formed (with Prof. Poulton as\r\nChairman and Prof. Meldola as Treasurer) to erect a memorial, and the\r\nfollowing petition was sent to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster\r\nAbbey:\r\n\r\n    We, the undersigned, earnestly desiring a suitable national\r\n    memorial to the late Alfred Russel Wallace, and believing that no\r\n    position would be so appropriate as Westminster Abbey, the\r\n    burial-place of his illustrious fellow-worker Charles Darwin,\r\n    petition the Right Reverend the Dean and Chapter for permission to\r\n    place a medallion in Westminster Abbey. We further guarantee, if\r\n    the medallion be accepted, to pay the Abbey fees of £200.\r\n\r\n  ARCH. GEIKIE\r\n  WILLIAM CROOKES\r\n  A.B. KEMPE\r\n  E. RAY LANKESTER\r\n  D.H. SCOTT\r\n  D.

RAMSAY\r\n  SILVANUS P. THOMPSON\r\n  JOHN PERRY\r\n  JAMES MARCHANT (Hon. Sec.)\r\n\r\nTo which the Dean replied:\r\n\r\n    _The Deanery, Westminster, S.W. December 2, 1913._\r\n\r\n    Dear Mr. Marchant,--I have pleasure in informing you that I\r\n    presented your petition at our Chapter meeting this morning, and a\r\n    glad and unanimous assent was accorded to it.\r\n\r\n    I should be glad later on to be informed as to the artist you are\r\n    employing; and probably it would be as well for him and you and\r\n    some members of the Royal Society to meet me and the Chapter and\r\n    confer together upon the most suitable and artistic arrangement or\r\n    rearrangement of the medallions of the great men of science of the\r\n    nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n    Nothing could have been more satisfactory or impressive than the\r\n    document with which you furnished me this morning. I hope to get\r\n    it specially framed.--Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    HERBERT E. RYLE.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruce-Joy, who had made an excellent medallion of Dr. Wallace during\r\nhis lifetime, accepted the commission to fashion the medallion for\r\nWestminster Abbey, and it was unveiled, by a happy but undesigned\r\ncoincidence, on All Souls' Day, November 1 1915, together with\r\nmedallions to the memory of Sir Joseph Hooker and Lord Lister. In the\r\ncourse of his sermon, the Dean said--and with these words we may well\r\nconclude this book:\r\n\r\n\"To-day there are uncovered to the public view, in the North Aisle of\r\nthe Choir, three memorials to men who, I believe, will always be ranked\r\namong the most eminent scientists of the last century. They passed away,\r\none in 1911, one in 1912, and one in 1913. They were all men of\r\nsingularly modest character. As is so often observable in true\r\ngreatness, there was in them an entire absence of that vanity and\r\nself-advertisement which are not infrequent with smaller minds. It is\r\nthe little men who push themselves into prominence through dread of\r\nbeing overlooked. It is the great men who work for the work's sake\r\nwithout regard to recognition, and who, as we might say, achieve\r\ngreatness in spite of themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WALLACE AND DARWIN MEDALLIONS IN THE NORTH AISLE OF\r\nTHE CHOIR OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY]\r\n\r\n\"Alfred Russel Wallace was a most famous naturalist and zoologist. He\r\narrived by a flash of genius at the same conclusions which Darwin had\r\nreached after sixteen years of most minute toil and careful\r\nobservation.... It was a unique example of the almost exact concurrence\r\nof two great minds working upon the same subject, though in different\r\nparts of the world, without collusion and without rivalry.... Between\r\nDarwin and Wallace goodwill and friendship were never interrupted.\r\nWallace's life was spent in the pursuit of various objects of\r\nintellectual and philosophical interest, over which I need not here\r\nlinger. All will agree that it is fitting his medallion should be placed\r\nnext to that of Darwin, with whose great name his own will ever be\r\nlinked in the worlds of thought and science.\r\n\r\n\"All will acknowledge the propriety of these three great names being\r\nhonoured in this Abbey Church, even though it be, to use Wordsworth's\r\nphrase, already\r\n\r\n  'Filled with mementoes, satiate with its part\r\n     Of grateful England's overflowing dead.'\r\n\r\n\"These are three men whose lifework it was to utilise and promote\r\nscientific discovery for the preservation and betterment of the human\r\nrace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLISTS OF WALLACE'S WRITINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--BOOKS\r\n\r\nDate                  Title\r\n\r\n1853    \"Palm Trees on the Amazon\"\r\n1853    \"A Narrative of Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro.\" New\r\n             Edition in \"The Minerva Library,\" 1889\r\n1866    \"The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural\"\r\n1869    \"The Malay Archipelago,\" 2 vols.

Many men who are very clever--much\r\ncleverer than the discoverers--never originate anything. As far as I can\r\nconjecture, the art consists in habitually searching for the causes and\r\nmeaning of everything which occurs.\"--\"Emma Darwin,\" p. 207.\r\n\r\n[69] It is interesting to compare this with Darwin's manner of writing.\r\nDarwin confessed: \"There seems to be a sort of fatality in my mind\r\nleading me to put at first my statement or proposition in a wrong or\r\nawkward form. Formerly I used to think about my sentences before writing\r\nthem down; but for several years I have found that it saves time to\r\nscribble in a vile hand whole pages as quickly as I possibly can,\r\ncontracting half the words; and then correct deliberately. Sentences\r\nthus scribbled down are often better ones than I could have written\r\ndeliberately.\"\r\n\r\n[70] See pp. 227, 234.\r\n\r\n[71] But see _ante_, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[72] Wallace's section of the Darwin-Wallace Essay entitled \"On the\r\nTendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of\r\nVarieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection.\"",
