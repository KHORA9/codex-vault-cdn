CARR, _Librarian Scranton (Pa.) Public Library_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn your presence, and in addressing you to-night as presiding officer, I\r\nfeel to a far greater extent than I can express in words the high honor\r\nthat has been conferred in each instance upon all who from time to time\r\nhave been chosen to serve as a president of this particular association.\r\n\r\nThere is in this present age, to be sure, no lack of those popular and\r\npeculiar entities termed associations--associations of many kinds, and\r\nfor almost every conceivable purpose. Throughout the entire continent\r\nthere exist few, perhaps none, whose history, objects, and work, have\r\nwarranted a more justifiable pride in being a member thereof, than is\r\nfound in being a member of the American Library Association.\r\n\r\nIt may here be said that conditions and circumstances have been\r\nfavorable to the success of the A. L. A.; not the least of which has\r\nbeen the faithful loyalty of its individual members. We realize, too,\r\nthat even time has dealt leniently with it, upon noting that of the 64\r\nmembers who attended its first meeting, held at Philadelphia twenty-five\r\nyears ago, but 18 have died, and that 20 persons are yet included in its\r\nmembership list out of the 69 who joined the association in 1876, that\r\ninitial year. Some of that original number, much to our gratification,\r\nare present with us at this 23d general meeting.\r\n\r\nConsidering its purely voluntary nature, the migratory holding of its\r\nsuccessive meetings in different parts of the land, and the notable\r\navoidance of fads, or any tendency towards selfish ends that might\r\notherwise mark its united efforts, it becomes almost a matter of\r\nsurprise that so many persons have unfalteringly kept up their\r\nallegiance from year to year ever since the time of their joining the\r\nassociation. But, as a matter of fact, the A. L. A. has at no time\r\nfallen off in its total membership; and at this date it numbers nearly\r\none thousand contributing members paying dues for the current year.\r\n\r\nThe American Library Association has now attained a period of\r\ntwenty-five years in its history--a quarter of a century. During that\r\ntime, in the addresses given at its general meetings, as well as in the\r\nmultiplicity of noteworthy and valuable papers contributed to its\r\nProceedings, and the sundry publications devoted to library interests,\r\nit would appear as if there must have been presented almost every\r\nconceivable phase of library thought and sentiment. Can anything new be\r\nsaid, or old ideas placed in a new light, so as to be worthy of hearing\r\nand attention at this time? I fear not, except as some lessons may be\r\ndrawn from the experience of one's past work, perhaps, that shall serve\r\nto aid yet others who are to tread like paths in life.\r\n\r\nI beg, therefore, that you will bear with me for a short space of time\r\nwhile I give expression to some thoughts drawn from the experience of\r\nmyself and others while Being a Librarian.\r\n\r\nWithout now restricting their application to particular phases of\r\nlibrarianship, let us at the outset consider them as relating to any and\r\nall conditions of it as a vocation. \"Why did you take up library work?\"\r\nis a question not infrequently asked. To that query various answer may\r\nbe given, according to the individual views of the persons replying.\r\nPerhaps one general reason, that in a certain way has had its\r\nunconscious influence upon many of us, is best stated in the following\r\ncharacteristic passage from the \"Book-hunter:\"\r\n\r\n\"To every man of our Saxon race endowed with full health and strength,\r\nthere is committed the custody of a restless demon, for which he is\r\ndoomed to find ceaseless excitement, either in honest work, or some less\r\nprofitable or more mischievous occupation. Countless have been the\r\nprojects of man to open up for this fiend fields of exertion great\r\nenough for the absorption of its tireless energies, and none of them is\r\nmore hopeful than the great world of books, if the demon is docile\r\nenough to be coaxed into it.\"\r\n\r\nSince Burton's day the \"great world of books\" has taken on many phases\r\nof which he never dreamed. And we, as librarians, may reasonably believe\r\nthat if not entirely a part and parcel of it, we are nevertheless called\r\nupon to deal with that \"world\" in almost every form, and are ourselves\r\nmore or less important factors in it. We may not be called upon to adopt\r\nthe \"strenuous life,\" or seek to impart it to the conduct and activities\r\nof others. But necessarily we are and must be accustomed to \"doing\r\nthings\"; and, by that very doing, will in some degree, each in our own\r\nfield, inspire and influence others also.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, do we not find _our_ \"restless demon of work\" more\r\nagreeably inclined and contentedly occupied in the library field than in\r\nother lines of life which we may have previously entered into? I, for\r\none, certainly think so, even though we may not have had that idea in\r\nmind at the outset, or when making the change. And, too, that we derive\r\na certain feeling of encouragement akin to inspiration, that in itself\r\nrenders _us_ contented and happy, when responding to the varied demands\r\non our time and energy that are entailed by our positions as librarians.\r\nThat is half the battle, the rest being but a question of persistence in\r\nthe application of means and ability.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the consoling words of one of Elbert Hubbard's salient\r\nsayings: \"Blessed is that man who has found his work.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of these present remarks to set forth particularly\r\nthe compensations in a librarian's work; neither the advantages or\r\ndisadvantages, the opportunities or drawbacks therein. Those factors\r\nhave all been frequently and well discussed in prior years, by some of\r\nour well-known associates and various contributors to library\r\nliterature. I desire, rather, to suggest some features and relationships\r\nconnected with our work as a profession, from which an occasional lesson\r\nmay be taken, and possibly a word of encouragement, if such be needed.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, is librarianship a profession? Does it possess the\r\ncharacteristics that make it such; and is that work more nearly\r\nprofessional than otherwise, which lies at its hands to be done? Some\r\nsuch queries were propounded to me by the president of a state library\r\nassociation one day last fall, as we were journeying together to an\r\nannual meeting. He, himself, had been a teacher and an educational\r\nadministrator for a number of years before becoming a librarian; and of\r\nthe recognized professional standing of his _former_ occupation there\r\ncould be no doubt.\r\n\r\nMy first, and off-hand, answer was to the effect that librarianship\r\ncertainly has many professional features, even though its being a true\r\nand undoubted profession in every respect might be disputed now and\r\nthen. Going further into this question of professional status, however,\r\nit will be found that the literature of views and discussions thereon,\r\npro and con, is by no means small. For one of us to now express a doubt\r\nthat librarianship, as a whole, is a profession, would be almost\r\npresumptuous; and I, for one, do not propose to do so. My thesis, so far\r\nas it relates to the present remarks, is in affirmation of the claim;\r\nnot only that it is a profession--our profession--but really the\r\nprofession of professions!\r\n\r\nAll other professions now depend to a considerable extent upon that of\r\nthe librarian for the custodianship of their literature, without whose\r\ncare much of it might be lost. We may not be able to transmit to future\r\neras such enduring records of antiquity as has been done by the\r\nlibrarian of old in his collection of clay tablets (which now serve to\r\ntell us of the affairs of mankind as transacted thousands of years ago),\r\nbut it is certain that we are doing our part towards making modern\r\nliterature available in disseminating it, and in preserving it as far as\r\nlies in our power.\r\n\r\nCotemporaneous with the organization of this association Melvil Dewey\r\nmade the following decided and well-supported assertion: \"The time has\r\nat last come when a librarian, may, without assumption, speak of his\r\noccupation as a profession.\" I cite Mr. Dewey's words, not as\r\nnecessarily conclusive, but because he has ever been an active and\r\nconstant supporter of that doctrine in both his work as a librarian, as\r\na noted stimulator of the library movement, and as an originator of\r\nprofessional instruction of other librarians. Similar enthusiastic and\r\npersistent efforts on the part of librarians generally may do much\r\ntowards the furtherance of such features, and the consequent development\r\nof librarianship as a profession in all its aspects.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider for a few moments some features of resemblance and\r\ndiversity between the library profession and others quite as well or\r\nbetter known. It has been said that the library exists chiefly for the\r\nuse of its patrons, and that the librarian is necessarily and\r\nessentially a servant. Therefore the librarian must, of equal necessity,\r\nearn a livelihood or receive compensation of some kind for his services.\r\nAll of which, in the main, is true of the professions generally, as will\r\nbe seen from a brief statement of circumstances.\r\n\r\nDoctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, artists, etc., are engaged by\r\nand receive pay from their respective clients. The clergy are supported\r\nby contributions of their church members or from denominational\r\nresources. Teachers in the public schools are paid from public taxes,\r\nwhile those of private schools, or endowed institutions, receive their\r\ncompensation from various sources.\r\n\r\nThe clergy and teachers, as a rule, like most librarians, no matter how\r\nwilling or how well qualified, are under the further necessity of\r\nobtaining a \"call,\" or position, as a prerequisite to the exercise of\r\ntheir professional faculties. In that respect they are at a disadvantage\r\nin comparison with those practitioners in the other professions, already\r\nnamed, who can go to any locality, solicit clients and seek business\r\nopportunities, with reasonable assurance of obtaining both according to\r\nplace and the circumstances of supply and demand.\r\n\r\nIn some of the professions, both the so-called \"learned\" and the\r\npractical ones, there have been developed certain well recognized\r\ndifferentiations and specializations of professional work. Those lines\r\nhave usually been taken up in response to what has seemed a reasonable\r\ndemand for them; and in their exercise have not unfrequently brought\r\nboth reputation and corresponding remuneration to the specialists.\r\n\r\nPossibly the time has arrived for doing much more of that nature in the\r\nlibrary profession than has yet been customary. And there are those\r\namong us, possessing a due amount of working experience coupled with\r\nknowledge of other and allied affairs, who might now do well to devote\r\nthemselves to some special features of library enterprise as a matter of\r\ndesirable business opportunity. Some from the library schools, and a few\r\nothers, have gone out as \"organizers,\" and found more or less of a field\r\nfor the exercise of their limited special qualifications. The field\r\nought to be a growing one, it would seem, if recourse to incompetent aid\r\nis carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nBut the offices of \"consulting librarianship,\" while possessing many\r\ndesirable and much needed features, do not appear to be practised as a\r\nspecific function. Something of the kind has been urged in past years,\r\nto be sure, and several well-known librarians did undertake at different\r\ntimes to supply such services. Sooner or later, however, each one was\r\npersuaded into a more certain, or better compensated, and permanent,\r\nposition of local librarianship, and thereupon abandoned that special\r\nline of work.\r\n\r\nIn this era of the establishment of so many new libraries, small and\r\ngreat, and of the gift of hundreds of buildings for such purposes, there\r\nis a decided need for the effective services which a consulting\r\nlibrarian might render; and this to a greater extent than is yet fully\r\nunderstood or appreciated. Lacking such, some librarians and more\r\nlibrary trustees work too often at a disadvantage. Many more, too, are\r\nburdened with repeated calls for information which more properly ought\r\nto be obtained from an independent expert; one so situated as to take an\r\nunbiased view of circumstances and equally able to give advice best\r\nsuited to the particular case in hand. Serious mistakes are sometimes\r\nmade in the preliminary details of new library enterprises that might\r\nbe just as easily avoided by the employment of a competent and paid\r\nprofessional adviser.\r\n\r\nTurning now to another side of our subject, and considering the relation\r\nof the individual librarians rather than of the profession as a class, a\r\nfew words upon personal actions may not be out of place. A librarian's\r\nposition is usually of a public or semi-public nature; ability for its\r\nduties is implied; and the compensation received is for present services\r\nas a rule, rather than as a reward of merit. In order that the library\r\nshall perform all that is expected of it, not only in being to some\r\nextent an ever-running machine but equally in respect to its recognized\r\nhigher functions, there must be the application of watchful care,\r\nconstant attention, foresight, and unremitting work. The direction of\r\nall of which, and perhaps much of its actual execution, must depend upon\r\nthe person placed in charge of the institution as its librarian.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, having a well-trained body of assistants, a library may\r\nbe able to run on for a time in the prolonged absence of, or when\r\nlacking, a chief; because impetus and the effects of past direction are\r\nnot lost at once, provided that no demoralization has taken place. But\r\nit is not a safe policy to allow a library, or other working institution\r\nthat depends largely upon the work of trained employees for its\r\neffectiveness, to go long at a time without the presence and oversight\r\nof an actual and capable head.\r\n\r\nYet it does not follow that the working hours of chief librarians should\r\nbe absorbed in attending to innumerable and trivial items of detail\r\nwhich might be delegated to and done quite as well, or better, by their\r\nassistants. Not only is \"genius a capacity for evading hard work,\" as\r\nhas been said, but one of the proper duties of the executive of a\r\nlibrary is to obtain the best results possible from the respective\r\ncapacities of those through whom the library does its work. All of which\r\nshould imply the exercise of a kindly and broad-minded disposition\r\ntowards one's assistants, just as truly as of respect and obedience to\r\none's superiors, or of courtesy and suavity in dealing with customers\r\nand the public. It may be only human for one to desire to be that \"king\r\nof his world,\" of whom Carlyle speaks; but any policy which reduces the\r\nassistants to mere machines is not a true professional one, since it\r\ntends to rob the library world of talent which is needed and, except for\r\nsuch repression, might be developed and brought forward.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I might plead no less for corresponding loyalty and\r\nfidelity on the part of all library workers, both to their respective\r\nchiefs and the institutions that employ them. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, action of that kind is the prevailing practice in this country,\r\nwith hardly an exception, and that phase needs no extended discussion. A\r\nchief is, of course, entitled to credit for acts done by subordinates at\r\nhis direction and for which he is responsible. But chiefs, in turn, can\r\nwell afford to give recognition to the ability and deeds of their\r\nassistants, and will seldom, if ever, lose by doing so.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two other features of librarianship which merit passing\r\nmention. Among them are what may be termed library succession, or the\r\nlibrarian's duty to his successor. Some few librarians \"die in the\r\nharness\"; while quite as many more change from one place to another at\r\ntimes. Occasionally they are succeeded by those who come new into the\r\nwork; and, gaining experience, become a credit to the profession.\r\nAdvancement of those trained in smaller libraries to places in larger\r\nones, or from the position of assistant in a library to the head\r\nthereof, has also brought forward quite as many more of those whose\r\nprogress we watch with cordial interest.\r\n\r\nAlthough conscious of those facts, and of the inevitable changes and\r\nsuccessions that must occur from year to year, do we recognize our duty\r\nto our successor? I have asked the question, but its consideration must\r\nbe left to some future time and opportunity.\r\n\r\nImpartiality in enforcing rules, and in dispensing the privileges of the\r\nlibrary to all comers, should be deemed an important feature of\r\nlibrarianship, quite as essential to the welfare of the institution as\r\nto the professional success of the librarian. And this suggests a query,\r\nwhich has before now been raised, as to how far librarians should go in\r\naiding persons who expect to use information obtained at the library,\r\nsolely for the furtherance of personal interests or for purposes of\r\npecuniary profit. Impartial and confidential treatment of all readers\r\nand seekers, who come to the library after information, would appear to\r\nbe the only safe practice and criterion, regardless of their particular\r\nmotives. Care should be taken, of course, to assist them in gaining the\r\ndesired information by means of their own study, and in their own way,\r\nrather than through the efforts of library employees applied to\r\nsearching out the exact and final facts for them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would direct your attention very briefly to yet another\r\nside of librarianship which ought to have an occasional bearing so far\r\nas ethical principles may apply.\r\n\r\nSince we regard librarianship as a profession it would seem that there\r\nmust needs be some recognized principles of an ethical nature relating\r\nto it. Like many of our working methods, however, they must probably\r\nexist chiefly as \"unwritten laws.\" It is always a difficult matter to\r\nput our ideals into words. They may be quite real to the sensibilities\r\nand yet hardly admit of being formulated. And, too, the evident contrast\r\nbetween the ideals aimed at, and the results attained, is often so great\r\nthat one hesitates to say in so many words just what is his ideal.\r\n\r\nStill there have been developed in the other leading professions, those\r\nthat are regarded as the most reputable and noteworthy, certain\r\nrecognized principles which serve to guide their members in many ways.\r\nThe full comprehension of such principles as an authoritative guide\r\ntends to a correct measurement of the real value of one's professional\r\nwork. Likewise, while supplying certain ideals at the outset, they may\r\naid in determining the lines of effort and action which will tend to\r\nelevate the profession itself and to the attainment of individual\r\nsuccess in its pursuits.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is too soon in the history of so young a profession to expect\r\nvery much in the nature of such formulations. To properly enumerate and\r\ndetermine the essential principles must call for the attention of many\r\nminds, working each in their own channel but aimed in the same general\r\ndirection, until the final outcome shall be a fully developed and\r\nrounded code of library ethics which will thus be entitled to and gain\r\nwell deserved recognition and observance.\r\n\r\nIf, in the views and various thoughts, which I have presumed to set\r\nforth at this time, such ideas as have a bearing on this last named\r\ntopic shall serve as hints to spur on some abler and more\r\nphilosophically versed person or persons to undertake the task, or serve\r\nas a ground upon which to build a foundation code, I shall be greatly\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              WHAT MAY BE DONE FOR LIBRARIES BY THE CITY.\r\n\r\n    BY THOMAS L. MONTGOMERY, _Trustee Free Library of Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in the course of human events, it became necessary for our people\r\nto dissolve the political bonds which connected them with another,\r\npretty much everything was declared a free and an inalienable right with\r\nthe exception of the public library. Whether it would have escaped the\r\nattention of that founder of circulating libraries and everything else\r\nthat is useful, had it not been a time of extraordinary pressure of\r\nbusiness, or whether he purposely neglected it in the belief that a\r\npeople that had expressed such lofty sentiments as to life, liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness might well be trusted to consider such matters\r\nin due time it is not our purpose to discuss. He does not hesitate to\r\ngive credit to the libraries in his autobiography for making the common\r\ntradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen in other\r\ncountries, and for contributing in some degree to the stand so generally\r\nmade throughout the colonies in defense of their privileges. It was not\r\nuntil about 1850 that the desirability of a city library was suggested\r\nto the City Council of Boston by Josiah Quincy, then mayor. The council\r\ncautiously Resolved, \"That it would accept any donation from citizens\r\nor others for the purpose of commencing a public city library and that\r\nwhenever the library shall be of the value of $30,000 it will be\r\nexpedient for the city to provide a suitable place and arrangements to\r\nenable it to be used by the citizens with as great a degree of freedom\r\nas the security of the property will permit.\" In July, 1852, the\r\ntrustees made a report \"that in their opinion the finances of the city\r\nwill not permit of the erecting of a building and the purchase of an\r\nample library.\" They suggest \"a moderate expenditure on the part of the\r\ncity for the purchase of books and the compensation of a librarian.\" It\r\nwas soon after this that Mr. Bates made his famous gift of $50,000 worth\r\nof books \"on condition that the city provide an adequate building which\r\nshall be an ornament to the city.\" A complete history of this\r\ninstitution would seem to be the best possible answer which could be\r\nmade to the question before us. What can the city do for the free\r\nlibrary. With a magnificent collection of 700,000 books, selected under\r\nthe administration of some of the best men who have dignified our\r\nprofession, and housed in the most expensive building ever erected by a\r\ncity for such a purpose, it would appear that the citizen of Boston\r\nmight rightly exclaim \"Si monumentum quaeris, circumspice.\"\r\n\r\nThe things that can be done by a city are innumerable; what it _ought_\r\nto do and what it _will_ do are perhaps more easily dealt with. Thinking\r\nI might obtain some information on the subject I asked the question of\r\nthe librarian of the Free Library of Philadelphia. He settled himself in\r\nhis chair and assuming the tone of an oracle said that there were three\r\nthings that the city should do for its library. 1. Provide an adequate\r\nappropriation for its maintenance; 2. Provide an extra appropriation for\r\nemergencies; and 3. Provide a special appropriation for some particular\r\nwork which the librarian might be particularly interested in at the\r\ntime. I asked several other prominent librarians the same question and\r\ntheir answers were to the same purport--namely, if the city could\r\nfurnish sufficient money they felt themselves fully competent to build\r\nup an ideal institution.\r\n\r\nWe all know as a matter of fact that the strong libraries of the country\r\nhave been built up by other means than the mere appropriation of money\r\nby city councils, and it is not unreasonable to mention as the first of\r\nthese the librarian. The city should see to it that this individual is a\r\nman (or woman) strong, intellectual and vigorous, without bumptiousness,\r\nwhich is often mistaken for vigor, and with those qualities which will\r\nprocure for him respectful attention from even those who may be opposed\r\nto him. I have often heard addresses made before this Association\r\nbewailing the fact that the city librarian had to deal with certain\r\npolitical elements which very much hampered him. I should regard this\r\nstate of affairs as belonging to the time when the college president was\r\nnecessarily a professor of moral philosophy whose duties consisted of\r\nreceiving the senior class for one hour a week to discuss Whewell's\r\n\"Elements.\" Such an officer must now be an active administrative power\r\nas well as an intellectual entity to at all meet the modern\r\nrequirements, and in like manner the public librarian should deem it a\r\nprivilege to meet the representatives of the city government and to have\r\nthe opportunity of impressing the needs of his institution upon them.\r\nThere is no better test of the capacity of the man for the great work in\r\nwhich he is engaged.\r\n\r\nSpeaking practically I would state that in the building up of the\r\nPhiladelphia Free Library in which I have taken an active interest, the\r\npolitical elements have always responded most generously to our\r\nrequests, and that the library has been more inconvenienced by the\r\nwritings and personal influence of certain well-to-do-citizens upon whom\r\nthe word \"paternalism\" has acted as a nightmare than by any difficulty\r\nwith the city government.\r\n\r\nWhile the city should provide means and a proper official to conduct the\r\ninstitution it should take much more care in the selection of the board\r\nof trustees than is usually the case. They should be representative men,\r\nwho not only should be able to assist the librarian in the formation of\r\nan educational institution, but also be able to devote a considerable\r\namount of time to matters relating to its policy. If the librarian is\r\nnot a systematic business man, one of the board or a committee should be\r\ndelegated to attend to the financial affairs, as it is absolutely\r\nnecessary that the accounts shall be at all times in as good condition\r\nas in the most punctilious business house.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest that a certain modesty be observed in the carrying\r\nout of such work by a municipality. It is hard to think of anything that\r\ncould be said for this proposition when the magnificent buildings of\r\nBoston, Chicago and Pittsburgh are taken into consideration; but I would\r\nrespectfully submit that the feeling of unrest among the great army of\r\nindustrial workers throughout the civilized world is growing. With the\r\ntremendous progress in science and industry these people are claiming\r\nthat they can see no gain in the position of the common people. This\r\ndiscontent has manifested itself lately in the opposition of the labor\r\norganizations of certain towns to the munificent proposition made by one\r\nof the most conscientious men who has ever been numbered among the\r\nmultimillionaires of the world. While it is not always wise to consider\r\ntoo seriously the socialistic murmurings of a few negative people, I\r\nsubmit that it is our duty to consider the effect produced upon the\r\npoorest and most scantily clad patron of our libraries.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the library should be housed in a fireproof\r\nbuilding as soon as possible, and the owners of valuable books will\r\nalways choose such an institution for such gifts as they may make. I\r\nbelieve that the Boston Library has received donations equal to half the\r\ncost of the building since it has been housed in Copley square.\r\n\r\nFinally, the city should insist that the library be an educational\r\ninstitution and not receive its appropriation for recreation mainly. The\r\nextraordinary demand for light fiction in public libraries has led to a\r\nvery unsatisfactory condition of affairs, and it is not uncommon to find\r\n300 copies of a new novel necessary to at all meet the demand. There is\r\nevery indication that the public library will be furnished with a happy\r\nrelease from this call upon their resources by the institution of the\r\nBook Lovers' Library which has now extended its branches to all the\r\nimportant cities. If this system can be extended on good business\r\nprinciples, the happiness of public libraries would be complete\r\nnotwithstanding the slight falling off in circulation that might follow.\r\n\r\nThe motto of every such institution should be: _Libri libere liberis_,\r\nwhich being freely translated, means: \"A free people should have open\r\nshelves if possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            WHAT MAY BE DONE FOR LIBRARIES BY THE STATE.[A]\r\n\r\n  BY E. A. BIRGE, _President Board of Directors, Madison (Wis.) Public\r\n                               Library_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relation of the state to libraries may be considered from three\r\npoints of view. The first and oldest library function of the state has\r\nbeen the maintenance of a state library, usually begun for the\r\nconvenience of the legislature and in many states enlarged into a\r\ngeneral library. With this function has also gone the indirect support\r\nof libraries for historical and scientific societies, incorporated by\r\nthe state and in some degree representing it. Much might be said on\r\npossible lines of work for the state in this direction, but as this\r\nfunction is the oldest and best understood, it may be named and passed\r\nwithout further discussion.\r\n\r\nSecond, the state holds a relation to the local libraries in communities\r\nwhich are supporting free libraries without aid from the state. The\r\nstate aids these libraries by enacting proper laws for their\r\norganization. In general, the statutes should be such as will give the\r\nlocal library the best opportunity for organization, and will leave it\r\nwhen organized the largest amount of freedom in doing its work. The\r\nearlier library laws of the states have very generally contained the\r\nprovision that, in order to establish a library in a community, the\r\nproposition must be accepted by a majority of the voters at an election.\r\nThis provision has been found disadvantageous in Wisconsin, and was\r\neliminated from our library law in 1897. Experience has shown that it\r\nis better to leave the establishment of a library, like other public\r\nworks of necessity and utility, to the common council, or other\r\nrepresentatives of the people in the larger towns and cities, rather\r\nthan to commit the proposition to the chance of a general election.\r\n\r\nThe third function of the state with reference to libraries is that\r\nwhich may be called library extension. Here the state acts directly to\r\naid in the establishment of libraries and the extension of library work\r\nin the communities which would otherwise lack libraries. The necessity\r\nfor this work has become apparent to the more progressive states of the\r\nUnion within recent years. The justification of this work lies in two\r\nmain reasons. First, libraries continue for the older youth of the\r\ncommunity and for adults the education which the state requires for\r\nchildren. It is neither fair nor right for the state to maintain a\r\nsystem of education which develops a love of knowledge and of reading,\r\nand then leave the community without the means for continuing in later\r\nyouth the development begun in childhood. Second, it is known that the\r\nintellectual isolation of the rural communities is one of the main\r\nreasons for the much-lamented drift from the country into the cities,\r\nand it has been found that the establishment of libraries affords one of\r\nthe most important means of bringing these small communities into\r\nintellectual touch with the world.\r\n\r\nThe states then which have undertaken this work of library extension\r\nhave usually done so by means of the library commission. The first\r\ncommission was established by Massachusetts in 1890. Seventeen states\r\nhad established such commissions by the end of 1900--more than half of\r\nthem in the two years preceding that date. I have no statistics\r\nregarding the establishment of such commissions in 1901. The work of\r\nthese commissions may be either advisory or missionary, aiding in the\r\nestablishment of libraries in the smaller communities which are able to\r\nestablish and maintain them under the guidance and advice of the\r\ncommission, and directly furnishing library facilities to the smallest\r\nand weakest communities. In certain states direct state aid is given to\r\nthe smaller libraries, notably in Massachusetts, where each town library\r\nestablished under the rules of the commission receives books to the\r\namount of $100. In some states aid is given in the purchase of books.\r\nThe direct furnishing of libraries is done mainly by means of travelling\r\nlibraries. So far as I can learn, these are now distributed by six\r\nstates. The system has grown throughout the Union, in various\r\nmanifestations, and its influence in bringing books to the communities\r\nthat most lack and need them has been of the utmost value. This work is\r\none of the greatest importance, and yet I believe it is one which will\r\nultimately pass into the hands of the counties or smaller governmental\r\nbodies than the state.\r\n\r\nLastly, the commissions are aiding in the library work by the\r\nestablishment of library schools. In Wisconsin a summer school for\r\nlibrary training has been held for the past seven years, and represents\r\na class of work which it seems important that each state should\r\nundertake, namely: the training of librarians for the smaller libraries\r\nin which the salaries paid are necessarily so small that the librarians\r\ncannot afford the expense of a complete course in library training. This\r\ninstruction applies especially to persons already in charge of small\r\nlibraries throughout the state, who have not had the opportunity to\r\nsecure professional training for their work, and it is of great value in\r\nbringing them in touch with library effort and setting higher standards\r\nof purpose and efficiency. Experience has shown that in a two months'\r\nsummer session instruction can be given of the greatest value to those\r\nwho are to have charge of this class of libraries.\r\n\r\nIn this department of library extension which the states have been\r\nentering upon during the past decade lies the most important work which\r\nthe state can undertake for libraries. The work of the library\r\ncommissions means a systematic employment of the library as an\r\neducational and social factor in the progress of the people. This is the\r\ntrue mission of the library, and the most important function of the\r\nstate lies in effectively aiding it to perform this work.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Abstract.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             WHAT MAY BE DONE FOR LIBRARIES BY THE NATION.\r\n\r\n              BY HERBERT PUTNAM, _Librarian of Congress_.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have had suggestions as to what may be done for libraries by the\r\ncity and what by the state. Whatever is left over--if there is anything\r\nleft over--I am to treat as something that may be done by the\r\nnation--the nation not as an aggregate of its parts, but as a unit,\r\nacting through its central authority. There is a disposition to contend\r\nthat _everything_ which may be more effectively or more economically\r\ndone by a central authority for the larger area should be undertaken by\r\nthat authority. I am not prepared to go so far. There may be a value in\r\nlocal effort that will repay its greater cost. But in an educational\r\nwork which involves the accumulation of material some of which is\r\nexceedingly costly, only part of which is constantly in use, and little\r\nof which perishes by use; a work whose processes are capable of\r\norganization on a large scale and the application of co-operative\r\neffort: there must be certain undertakings which, relatively speaking,\r\nare possible only if assumed by a central authority. It is such\r\nundertakings, for the largest area, that I am asked to discover and set\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nTo do so involves consequences which may be inconvenient. For a possible\r\nservice means a correlative duty. And as I myself to a degree represent\r\nhere the central authority in question, whatever I state as a service\r\nappropriate for that authority, I shall have to admit as a duty in which\r\nI must share. I shall try to be candid. But under the circumstances I\r\ncannot be expected to be more than candid.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the Federal Government of the United States has already\r\ninfluenced the constitution, resources and service of our public\r\nlibraries. It has enacted laws which, having for their primary purpose\r\nthe protection of authors and publishers, benefit libraries by\r\nencouraging the manufacture of books soundly, substantially and honestly\r\nmade. It has favored public libraries by exempting from tariff duty\r\nbooks imported for their use. It has encouraged the study of the\r\nclassics by laying a penalty upon the general importation of books less\r\nthan twenty years old. In its executive capacity it is itself\r\ninvestigator, author, publisher, manufacturer, distributor,\r\nstatistician, bibliographer, and librarian. It maintains at Washington,\r\nwith a generosity not paralleled by any other government, bureaus for\r\nscientific research; it compiles, publishes, and freely distributes the\r\nresults of this research. It is the greatest publisher in the world, and\r\nthe largest manufacturer of books. In a single publication, repeated\r\neach year, it consumes over a million pounds of paper stock; and it\r\nmaintains a bureau whose purpose is to replenish the forests which as\r\npublisher it thus depletes. It distributes gratuitously to the libraries\r\nof the United States each year over 300,000 volumes, embodying the\r\nresults of its research, its legislative proceedings, and an account of\r\nits administrative activities. It maintains a bureau for the\r\ninvestigation of problems in education, for the accumulation and\r\ndissemination of information concerning the work of educational\r\ninstitutions; and it has included the public libraries of this country\r\namong such educational institutions. This bureau has issued three\r\nreports tabulating statistics concerning them, one also (in 1876)\r\nsummarizing their history and two (in 1876 and in 1893) containing\r\nessays which embody the best contemporary opinion as to library\r\nequipment and methods. It has published as a document the A. L. A. list\r\nof best books to form the basis of a public library.\r\n\r\nThrough its bureau of documents it is seeking to index and adequately to\r\nexhibit its own publications, to facilitate their distribution to\r\nlibraries and to afford to libraries as to federal documents a clearing\r\nhouse for duplicates.\r\n\r\nAll such services are obviously appropriate for the national authority\r\nand may doubtless be continued and extended. If the interchange of books\r\namong libraries is to be facilitated by special postal regulations this\r\ncan be accomplished by the national authority alone.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of a state a service has been described which is to be\r\nrendered to local libraries by the library which the state itself owns\r\nand maintains. Now the federal government also owns and maintains\r\nlibraries. What may be demanded of these? Certain precedents have\r\nalready been established. The library of the Surgeon General's\r\noffice--the most comprehensive in the world within its special\r\nfield--sends its books to members of the medical profession throughout\r\nthe United States, relieving just so much the burden upon local\r\nlibraries; and it has issued a catalog which is not merely in form and\r\nmethod efficient, but is so nearly an exhibit of the entire literature\r\nof the medical sciences that it renders unnecessary duplication of\r\ncataloging and analytical work within the field which it covers. This\r\ncatalog has conferred a general benefit not equalled by any\r\nbibliographic work within any other department of literature. It is\r\nperhaps the most eminent bibliographic work yet accomplished by any\r\ngovernment. The cost of its mere publication--which is the cost\r\nchargeable to the general benefit--has already exceeded $250,000.\r\n\r\nBut this library is but one of several collections maintained by the\r\nFederal Government; the aggregate of which is already nearly two million\r\nvolumes. In each federal department and bureau there is a library. And\r\nthere is a central collection which in itself is already the largest on\r\nthe western hemisphere. It was created as a legislative library--for the\r\nuse of both Houses of Congress. It is still called the Library of\r\nCongress. But it is now being referred to as something more. The\r\ngovernment has erected for it a building which is the largest, most\r\nelaborate, and most costly yet erected for library purposes. The seven\r\nmillion dollars which it cost has been paid not by the District of\r\nColumbia, but by the country at large. No such sum would have been\r\nrequisite for a building to serve Congress alone. It seems to intend a\r\nlibrary that shall serve the country at large, if there is any such\r\nthing possible. In fact the library is already being referred to as the\r\nNational Library of the United States. What does this mean? or rather,\r\nwhat _may_ this mean? One naturally looks abroad--to the foremost of\r\nnational libraries.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum is a huge repository of material. In scope it is\r\nuniversal. Its purpose is accumulation, preservation, and the aid of\r\nresearch by accredited persons, upon its own premises. Its service is\r\npurely responsive. It has printed catalogs of its own collections, but\r\ndoes not undertake bibliographic work general in nature, nor engage in\r\nco-operative bibliographic undertakings. It lends no books.\r\n\r\nBut I fear you will hardly be satisfied with the analogy. The British\r\nMuseum, you will say, is placed in a city which is not merely the\r\ncapital of the British Empire, but the metropolis; the literary\r\nmetropolis also of the Anglo-Saxon race. The Library of Congress is at\r\nthe capital of the United States. But this capital is not itself a\r\nmetropolis. No student in Great Britain has to travel over 500 miles to\r\nreach the British Museum. A student in the United States may have to\r\ntravel as much as 3000 miles to reach the Library of Congress. The area\r\nwhich supports the national library of Great Britain is but 100,000\r\nsquare miles; that which supports the National Library of the United\r\nStates is ever 3,000,000 square miles. The conditions differ, and\r\ntherefore, you will say, the obligation. If there is any way in which\r\nour National Library may \"reach out\" from Washington it should reach\r\nout. Its first duty is no doubt as a legislative library--to Congress.\r\nIts next is as a federal library to aid the executive and judicial\r\ndepartments of the government and the scientific undertakings under\r\ngovernmental auspices. Its next is to that general research which may be\r\ncarried on at Washington by resident and visiting students and scholars:\r\nwhich in American history, political and social science, public\r\nadministration, jurisprudence and international law is likely to make\r\nWashington its center, and which, under the auspices of the Washington\r\nMemorial Institution--that new project for post graduate study involving\r\nthe use of the scientific collections and scientific experts at\r\nWashington--is likely to be organized in various branches of the natural\r\nand physical sciences as well. But this should not be the limit. There\r\nshould be possible also a service to the country at large: a service to\r\nbe extended through the libraries which are the local centers of\r\nresearch involving the use of books. That claim may be made. Now what at\r\nWashington might be useful to these libraries?\r\n\r\n(A lively imagination is not requisite.) Suppose there could be a\r\ncollection of books universal in scope, as no local library with limited\r\nfunds and limited space can hope to be: a collection that shall contain\r\nalso particularly (1) original sources, (2) works of high importance for\r\noccasional reference, but whose cost to procure and maintain precludes\r\ntheir acquisition by a local library pressed to secure the material of\r\nordinary and constant need, and (3) the \"useless\" books; books not\r\ncostly to acquire, but of so little general concern as not to justify\r\ncataloging, space and care in each local library if only they are known\r\nto be preserved and accessible somewhere.\r\n\r\nSuch a collection must include also the general mass of books sought and\r\nheld by local libraries--the books for the ordinary reader; the daily\r\ntools of research. Its maintenance will involve processes--of\r\nclassification and cataloging--highly costly. Suppose the results of\r\nthese processes could be made generally available, so as to save\r\nduplication of such expenditure upon identical material held by local\r\nlibraries?\r\n\r\nA collection universal in scope will afford opportunity for\r\nbibliographic work not equalled elsewhere. Such work centered there\r\nmight advance the general interest with the least aggregate effort. The\r\nadequate interpretation of such a collection will involve the\r\nmaintenance of a corps of specialists. Suppose these specialists could\r\nbe available to answer inquiries from all parts of the country as to\r\nwhat material exists on any particular subject, where it is, how it may\r\nbe had, how most effectively it may be used?\r\n\r\nThere are special collections already existent in various localities in\r\nthe United States and likely to come into being through special local\r\nadvantage or incentive, or the interest of private collectors, or\r\nprivate endowment--which cannot be duplicated at Washington. Suppose\r\nthere could be at Washington a bibliographic statement of that which is\r\npeculiar to each of these collections; in brief, a catalog of the books\r\nin the United States--not of every library, not of every copy of every\r\nbook, but of every _book_ available for an investigator?\r\n\r\nThere are various bibliographic undertakings which may be co-operative.\r\nSuppose there could be at Washington a central bureau--with approved\r\nmethods, standard forms, adequate editorial capacity, and liberal\r\nfacilities for publication--which could organize and co-ordinate this\r\nwork among the libraries of the United States and represent them in such\r\nof it as--like the new Royal Society index--is to be international?\r\n\r\nThere is the exchange of material duplicated in one library, needed by\r\nanother. Suppose there could be at Washington a bureau which would serve\r\nas a clearing house for miscellaneous duplicates as the Bureau of\r\nDocuments serves for documents? It might accomplish much without\r\nhandling a single article; it might, like a clearing house proper as it\r\nwere, set debit against credit, _i. e._, compare the deficiencies in one\r\nlibrary with the surplus in another and communicate the results to the\r\ninstitutions interested. It might do this upon slip lists sent in by\r\neach--of duplicates and of particular deficiencies--in sets, for\r\ninstance. One of my associates has been guilty of this very suggestion.\r\nIt is likely to bring something upon his head. He may have his choice\r\nbetween live coals and the ashes of repentance.\r\n\r\nNow those are some of the things which might be asserted as the duty of\r\nWashington to the country at large. I have touched them as lightly as\r\npossible: but there they are. And we may not be able to avoid them. Nay,\r\nwe seem to be drifting toward them. To some of them we are apparently\r\nalready committed.\r\n\r\nThere is the building: that in itself seems to commit us. There is\r\nequipment. There are books. As regards any national service the federal\r\nlibraries should be one library. They contain nearly two million\r\nvolumes. The Library of Congress contains net some 700,000 books and a\r\nhalf million other items. It has for increase (1) deposits under the\r\ncopyright law, (2) documents acquired through distribution of the\r\nfederal documents placed at its disposal for exchange--formerly 50\r\ncopies of each, now 100, (3) books and society publications acquired by\r\nthe Smithsonian through its exchanges, (4) miscellaneous gifts and\r\nexchanges, and, (5) purchases from appropriations. These have increased\r\nfrom $10,000 a year prior to 1897 to $70,000 for the year 1901-2.\r\n\r\nSuch resources are by no means omnipotent. _No_ resources can make\r\nabsolutely comprehensive a library starting its deliberate accumulations\r\nat the end of the 19th century. Too much material has already been\r\nabsorbed into collections from which it will never emerge.\r\n\r\nBut universality in scope does not mean absolute comprehensiveness in\r\ndetail. With its purchasing funds and other resources the Library of\r\nCongress bids fair to become the strongest collection in the United\r\nStates in bibliography, in Americana (omitting the earliest), in\r\npolitical and social science, public administration, jurisprudence. If\r\nany American library can secure the documents which will exhibit\r\ncompletely legislation proposed and legislation enacted it should be\r\nable to. As depository of the library of the Smithsonian it will have\r\nthe most important collection--perhaps in the world--of the transactions\r\nand proceedings of learned societies; and, adding its own exchanges and\r\nsubscriptions, of serials in general. With theology it may not\r\nespecially concern itself nor with philology to the degree appropriate\r\nto a university library. Medicine it will leave as a specialty to the\r\nlibrary of the Surgeon-General's office, already pre-eminent, Geology to\r\nthe library of the Geological Survey. Two extremes it may have to\r\nabstain from--so far as deliberate purchase is concerned: (1) the books\r\nmerely popular, (2) the books merely curious. Of the first many will\r\ncome to it through copyright; of the second many should come through\r\ngift. (Perhaps in time the public spirit of American collectors and\r\ndonors may turn to it as the public spirit of the British turns to the\r\nNational Library of Great Britain.) Original sources must come to it, if\r\nat all, chiefly by gift. Manuscript material relating to American\r\nhistory it has, however, bought, and will buy.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, chiefly printed books. Of these, the useful books; of these\r\nagain, the books useful rather for the establishment of the fact than\r\nfor the mere presentation of it--the books for the advancement of\r\nlearning, rather than those for the mere diffusion of knowledge.\r\n\r\nLastly there is an organization. Instead of 42 persons, for all manner\r\nof service, there are now 261, irrespective of printers, binders, and\r\nthe force attending to the care of the building itself.\r\n\r\nThe copyright work is set off and interferes no longer with the energies\r\nof the library proper. There is a separate division having to do with\r\nthe acquisition of material, another--of 67 persons--to classify and\r\ncatalog it. There are 42 persons attending to the ordinary service of\r\nthe reading room as supplied from the stacks, and there are eight\r\nspecial divisions handling severally the current newspapers and\r\nperiodicals, the documents, manuscripts, maps, music, prints, the\r\nscientific publications forming the Smithsonian deposit, and the books\r\nfor the blind. There is a Division of Bibliography whose function is to\r\nassist in research too elaborate for the routine service of the reading\r\nroom, to edit the library publications, and to represent the library in\r\nco-operative bibliographic undertakings. There is now within the\r\nbuilding, besides a bindery, with a force of 45 employees, a printing\r\noffice, with a force of 21. The allotment for printing and binding, in\r\n1896 only $15,000, is for the coming year $90,000.\r\n\r\nThe immediate duty of this organization is near at hand. There is a huge\r\narrear of work upon the existing collection--necessary for its effective\r\nuse, and its intelligent growth. It must be newly classified throughout;\r\nand shelf listed. The old author slip catalog must be revised and\r\nreduced to print. There must be compiled a subject catalog, of which\r\nnone now exists. Innumerable gaps--that which is crooked can be made\r\nstraight, but that which is wanting cannot be numbered--innumerable gaps\r\nare to be ascertained and filled. A collection of reference books must\r\nbe placed back at the Capitol, with suitable apparatus, to bring the\r\nlibrary once more into touch with Congress and enable it to render the\r\nservice to Congress which is its first duty. The other libraries of the\r\nDistrict must be brought into association--not by gathering their\r\ncollections into the Library of Congress, but by co-ordinating processes\r\nand service. The Library of Congress as the center of the system can aid\r\nin this. It can strengthen each departmental library by relieving it of\r\nmaterial not necessary to its special work. It can aid toward\r\nspecialization in these departmental libraries by exhibiting present\r\nunnecessary duplication. (It is just issuing a union list of serials\r\ncurrently taken by the libraries of the District which has this very\r\npurpose.) It can very likely print the catalog cards for all the\r\ngovernment libraries--incidentally securing uniformity, and a copy for\r\nits own use of each card--which in time will result in a complete\r\nstatement within its own walls of the resources of every departmental\r\nlibrary in Washington. It will supply to each such library a copy of\r\nevery card which it prints of a book in its own collections relating to\r\nthe work of the bureau which such library serves.\r\n\r\nTo reduce to order the present collection, incorporating the current\r\naccessions, to fill the most inconvenient gaps, to supply the most\r\nnecessary apparatus in catalogs and to bring about a relation among the\r\nlibraries of Washington which shall form them into an organic _system_:\r\nthis work will of itself be a huge one. I have spoken of the equipment\r\nof the Library of Congress as elaborate, the force as large, and the\r\nappropriations as generous. All are so in contrast to antecedent\r\nconditions. In proportion to the work to be done, however, they are not\r\nmerely not excessive, but in some respects far short of the need. To\r\nproceed beyond those immediate undertakings to projects of general\r\nservice will require certain equipment, service, and funds not yet\r\nsecured, and which can be secured only by a general effort. But the\r\nquestion is not what can be done, but what _may_ be done--in due time,\r\neventually.\r\n\r\nA general distribution of the printed cards: That has been suggested. It\r\nwas suggested a half century ago by the Federal Government through the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. Professor Jewett's proposal then was a central\r\nbureau to compile, print and distribute cards which might serve to local\r\nlibraries as a catalog of their own collections. Such a project is now\r\nbefore this Association. It may not be feasible: that is, it might not\r\nresult in the economy which it suggests. It assumes a large number of\r\nbooks to be acquired, in the same editions, by many libraries, at the\r\nsame time. In fact, the enthusiasm for the proposal at the Montreal\r\nmeeting last year has resulted in but sixty subscriptions to the actual\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nIt may not be feasible. But if such a scheme can be operated at all it\r\nmay perhaps be operated most effectively through the library which for\r\nits own uses is cataloging and printing a card for every book currently\r\ncopyrighted in the United States, and for a larger number of others than\r\nany other single institution. Such must be confessed of the Library of\r\nCongress. It is printing a card for every book currently copyrighted,\r\nfor every other book currently added--for every book reached in\r\nre-classification--and thus in the end for every book in its collection.\r\nIt is now printing, at the rate of over 200 titles a day--60,000 titles\r\na year. The entry is an author entry, in form and type accepted by the\r\ncommittee on cataloging of the A. L. A. The cards are of the standard\r\nsize--3 × 5 inches--of the best linen ledger stock. From 15 to 100\r\ncopies of each are now printed. It would be uncandid to say that such a\r\nnumber is necessary for the use of the library itself, or of the\r\ncombined libraries at Washington. The usefulness of copies of them to\r\nany other library for incorporation in its catalogs must depend upon\r\nlocal conditions: the style, form, and size of its own cards, the number\r\nof books which it adds yearly, the proportion of these which are\r\ncurrent, and other related matters. On these points we have sought\r\nstatistics from 254 libraries. We have them from 202. With them we have\r\nsamples of the cards in use by each, with a complete author entry.\r\nHaving them we are in a position really to estimate the chances. I will\r\nnot enter into details. Summarily, it appears that our cards might\r\neffect a great saving to certain libraries and some saving to others,\r\nand would entail a mere expense without benefit to the remainder--all of\r\nwhich is as might have been guessed.\r\n\r\nThe distribution suggested by Professor Jewett and proposed by the A. L.\r\nA. had in view a saving to the recipient library of cataloging and\r\nprinting on its own account. It assumed a subscription by each\r\nrecipient to cover the cost of the extra stock and presswork. There is\r\nconceivable a distribution more limited in range, having another\r\npurpose. The national library wishes to get into touch with the local\r\nlibraries which are centers for important research. It wishes the\r\nfullest information as to their contents; it may justifiably supply them\r\nwith the fullest information as to its own contents. Suppose it should\r\nsupply them with a copy of every card which it prints, getting in return\r\na copy of every card which they print? I am obliged to disclose this\r\nsuggestion: for such an exchange has already been begun. A copy of every\r\ncard printed by the Library of Congress goes out to the New York Public\r\nLibrary: a copy of every card printed by the New York Public Library\r\ncomes to the Library of Congress. In the new building of the New York\r\nPublic Library there will be a section of the public card catalog\r\ndesignated The Catalog of the Library of Congress. It will contain at\r\nleast every title in the Library of Congress not to be found in any\r\nlibrary of the metropolis. In the Library of Congress a section of the\r\ngreat card catalog of American libraries outside the District will be a\r\ncatalog of the New York Public Library.\r\n\r\nI have here a letter from the librarian of Cornell University forwarding\r\na resolution of the Library Council (composed in part of faculty\r\nmembers) which requests for the university library a set of these cards.\r\nMr. Harris states that the purpose would be to fit up cases of drawers\r\nin the catalog room, which is freely accessible to any one desiring to\r\nconsult bibliographical aids, and arrange the cards in alphabetical\r\norder by authors, thus making an author catalog of the set. He adds \"The\r\nwhole question has been rather carefully considered and the unanimous\r\nsense of the council was that the usefulness of the catalog to us would\r\nbe well worth the cost of the cases, the space they would occupy, and\r\nthe time it would take to arrange and keep in order the cards.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a limit to such a distribution. But I suspect that it will not\r\nstop with New York and Ithaca.\r\n\r\nThere is some expense attendant on it. There is the extra stock, the\r\npresswork, the labor of sorting and despatching. No postage, however,\r\nfor the Library of Congress has the franking privilege, in and out. The\r\nresults however: one cannot deny them to be attractive. At Washington a\r\nstatement of at least the distinctive contents of every great local\r\ncollection. At each local center of research a statement of the\r\ndistinctive contents of the national collection. An inquirer in\r\nWisconsin writes to Washington: is such a book to be had in the United\r\nStates; must he come to Washington for it, or to New York?--No, he will\r\nfind it in Chicago at the Newberry or the Crerar.\r\n\r\nIf there can be such a thing as a bibliographic bureau for the United\r\nStates, the Library of Congress is in a way to become one; to a degree,\r\nin fact, a bureau of information for the United States. Besides routine\r\nworkers efficient as a body, it has already some expert bibliographers\r\nand within certain lines specialists. It has not a complete corps of\r\nthese. It cannot have until Congress can be made to understand the need\r\nof them. Besides its own employees, however, it has within reach by\r\ntelephone a multitude of experts. They are maintained by the very\r\ngovernment which maintains it. They are learned men, efficient men,\r\nspecially trained, willing to give freely of their special knowledge.\r\nThey enter the government employ and remain there, not for the pecuniary\r\ncompensation, which is shamefully meagre, but for the love of the work\r\nitself and for the opportunity for public service which it affords. Of\r\nthese men, in the scientific bureaus at Washington, the National Library\r\ncan take counsel: it can secure their aid to develop its collections and\r\nto answer inquiries of moment. This will be within the field of the\r\nnatural and physical sciences. Meantime within its walls it possesses\r\nalready excellent capacity for miscellaneous research, and special\r\ncapacity for meeting inquiries in history and topography, in general\r\nliterature, and in the special literature of economics, mathematics and\r\nphysics. It has still Ainsworth Spofford and the other men, who with\r\nhim, under extraordinary disadvantages, for thirty-five years made the\r\nlibrary useful at the Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe library is already issuing publications in book form. In part these\r\nare catalogs of its own contents; in part an exhibit of the more\r\nimportant material in existence on some subject of current interest,\r\nparticularly, of course, in connection with national affairs. Even\r\nduring the period of organization fifteen such lists have already been\r\nissued. They are distributed freely to libraries and even to individual\r\ninquirers.\r\n\r\nBut there may be something further. The distribution of cards which\r\nexhibit its own contents or save duplication of expense elsewhere, the\r\npublication of bibliographies which aid to research, expert service\r\nwhich in answer to inquiry points out the best sources and the most\r\neffective methods of research: all these may have their use. But how\r\nabout the books themselves? Must the use of this great collection be\r\nlimited to Washington? How many of the students who need some book in\r\nthe Library of Congress--perhaps there alone--can come to Washington to\r\nconsult it at the moment of need? A case is conceivable: a university\r\nprofessor at Madison or Berkeley or San Antonio, in connection with\r\nresearch important to scholarship, requires some volume in an unusual\r\nset. The set is not in the university library. It is too costly for that\r\nlibrary to acquire for the infrequent need. The volume is in the\r\nNational Library. It is not at the moment in use at Washington. The\r\nuniversity library requests the loan of it. If the National Library is\r\nto _be_ the national library----?\r\n\r\nThere might result some inconvenience. There would be also the peril of\r\ntransit. Some volumes might be lost to posterity. But after all we are\r\nourselves a posterity. Some respect is due to the ancestors who have\r\nsaved for _our_ use. And if one copy of a book possessed by the federal\r\ngovernment and within reasonable limits subject to call by different\r\ninstitutions, might suffice for the entire United States--what does\r\nlogic seem to require--and expediency--and the good of the greater\r\nnumber?\r\n\r\nThe Library of Congress is now primarily a reference library. But if\r\nthere be any citizen who thinks that it should never lend a book--to\r\nanother library--in aid of the higher research--when the book can be\r\nspared from Washington and is not a book within the proper duty of the\r\nlocal library to supply--if there be any citizen who thinks that for the\r\nNational Library to lend under these circumstances would be a misuse of\r\nits resources and, therefore, an abuse of trust--he had better speak\r\nquickly, or he may be too late. Precedents may be created which it would\r\nbe awkward to ignore.\r\n\r\nReally I have been speaking of the Library of Congress as if it were the\r\nonly activity of the federal government of interest to libraries. That,\r\nhowever, is the fault of the topic. It was not what might be done for\r\nscience, for literature, for the advance of learning, for the diffusion\r\nof knowledge. It was merely what might be done for _libraries_; as it\r\nwere, not for the glory of God, but for the advancement of the church.\r\nWe have confidence in the mission of libraries and consider anything in\r\naid of it as good in itself.\r\n\r\nTheir most stimulating, most fruitful service must be the direct\r\nservice. The service of the national authority must in large part be\r\nmerely indirect. It can meet the reader at large only through the local\r\nauthority. It can serve the great body of readers chiefly through the\r\nlocal libraries which meet them face to face, know their needs, supply\r\ntheir most ordinary needs. Its natural agent--we librarians at least\r\nmust think this--is its own library--the library which if there is to be\r\na national library not merely of, but _for_ the United States--must be\r\nthat library.\r\n\r\n_Must become_ such, I should have said. For we are not yet arrived. We\r\ncannot arrive until much preliminary work has been done, and much\r\nadditional resource secured from Congress. We shall arrive the sooner in\r\nproportion as you who have in charge the municipal and collegiate\r\nlibraries of the United States will urge upon Congress the advantage to\r\nthe interests you represent, of undertakings such as I have described.\r\nTo this point we have not asked your aid. In the equipment of the\r\nlibrary, in the reconstruction of its service, in the addition of more\r\nexpert service, in the improvement of immediate facilities, our appeal\r\nto Congress has been based on the work to be done near at hand. I have\r\nadmitted to you the possibility of these other undertakings of more\r\ngeneral concern. If they commend themselves to you as proper and\r\nuseful--the appeal for them must be primarily your appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE TRUSTEESHIP OF LITERATURE--I.\r\n\r\n                    BY GEORGE ILES, _New York City_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix months ago the curtain descended upon what is likely to be accounted\r\nthe most memorable century in the annals of mankind. So salient are\r\nthree of its characteristics that they challenge the eye of the most\r\ncasual retrospection. First of all, we see that knowledge was increased\r\nat a pace beyond precedent, to be diffused throughout the world with a\r\nnew thoroughness and fidelity. Next we must observe how republican\r\ngovernment passed from the slender ties spun in the times of Washington,\r\nJefferson and Adams, to the intimate and pervasive cords of to-day,\r\nwhen, as never before, the good of the bee is bound up with the welfare\r\nof the hive. Parallel with this political union of each and all there\r\nwas a growth of free organization which, in every phase of life, has\r\nsecured uncounted benefits which only joined hands may receive. Fresh\r\ntorches of light fraternally borne from the centers of civilization to\r\nits circumference have tended to bring the arts and ideals of life\r\neverywhere to the level of the best. These distinctive features of the\r\nnineteenth century were in little evidence at its dawn, but they became\r\nmore and more manifest with each succeeding decade. In American\r\nlibrarianship, as in many another sphere of labor, more was accomplished\r\nin the last quarter of the century than in the seventy-five preceding\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is as recently as 1852 that Boston opened the doors of the first free\r\npublic library established in an American city. Its founders were\r\nconvinced that what was good for the students at Harvard, the\r\nsubscribers to the Athenæum, was good for everybody else. Literature,\r\nthey felt, was a trust to be administered not for a few, but for the\r\nmany, to be, indeed, hospitably proffered to all. To this hour, by a\r\nwise and generous responsiveness to its ever-growing duties, the Boston\r\nfoundation remains a model of what a metropolitan library should be. As\r\nwith the capital, so with the state; to-day Massachusetts is better\r\nprovided with free public libraries than any other commonwealth on the\r\nglobe; only one in two hundred of her people are unserved by them, while\r\nwithin her borders the civic piety of her sons and daughters has reared\r\nmore than six score library buildings. The library commission of the\r\nstate is another model in its kind; its powers are in the main advisory,\r\nbut when a struggling community desires to establish a library, and\r\ncontributes to that end, the commission tenders judicious aid. The\r\npopulation of Massachusetts is chiefly urban, an exceptional case, for\r\ntaking the Union as a whole, notwithstanding the constant drift to the\r\ncities, much more than half the people are still to be found in the\r\ncountry. For their behoof village libraries have appeared in thousands.\r\nStill more effective, because linked with one another, are the\r\ntravelling libraries, inaugurated by Mr. Melvil Dewey in New York in\r\n1893, and since adopted in many other states of the Union, and several\r\nprovinces of Canada. All this registers how the democracy of letters has\r\ncome to its own. Schools public and free ensure to the American child\r\nits birthright of instruction; libraries, also public and free, are\r\nrising to supplement that instruction, to yield the light and lift, the\r\nentertainment and stimulus that literature stands ready to bestow. The\r\nold-time librarian, who was content to be a mere custodian of books, has\r\npassed from the stage forever; in his stead we find an officer anxious\r\nthat his store shall do all the people the utmost possible good. To that\r\nend he combines the zeal of the missionary with the address of a\r\nconsummate man of business. Little children are invited to cheery rooms\r\nwith kind and intelligent hospitality; teachers and pupils from the\r\npublic schools are welcomed to classrooms where everything is gathered\r\nthat the library can offer for their use; helpful bulletins and\r\nconsecutive reading lists are issued for the home circle; every book,\r\nmagazine and newspaper is bought, as far as feasible, with an eye to the\r\nspecial wants and interests of the community; information desks are set\r\nup; and partnerships are formed with expositors of acknowledged merit,\r\nwith museums of industry, of natural history, of the fine arts. Not the\r\nborrowers only, but the buyers of books are remembered. The Standard\r\nLibrary, brought together by Mr. W. E. Foster, in Providence, is a\r\nshining example in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe sense of trusteeship thus variously displayed has had a good many\r\nsources; let us confine our attention to one of them. During the past\r\nhundred years the treasure committed to the keeping of librarians has\r\nundergone enrichment without parallel in any preceding age. We have more\r\nand better books than ever before; they mean more than in any former\r\ntime for right living and sound thinking. A rough and ready\r\nclassification of literature, true enough in substance, divides it into\r\nbooks of power, of information, and of entertainment. Let us look at\r\nthese three departments a little in detail. Restricting our purview to\r\nthe English tongue, we find the honor roll of its literature lengthened\r\nby the names of Wordsworth, Tennyson and Matthew Arnold, Carlyle and\r\nRuskin, Emerson and Lowell. And not only to authors such as these must\r\nour debt be acknowledged. We owe scholarly editors nearly as much. In\r\nSpedding's Bacon, the Shakesperean studies of Mr. Furniss, and the\r\nChaucer of Professor Skeat, we have typical examples of services not\r\nenjoyed by any former age. To-day the supreme poets, seers and sages of\r\nall time are set before us in the clearest sunshine; their gold, refined\r\nfrom all admixture, is minted for a currency impossible before. In their\r\noriginal, unedited forms, the masterpieces of our language are now cheap\r\nenough to find their way to the lowliest cottage of the cross-roads.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, in the field of literature pure and simple that the\r\nmanna fell most abundantly during the past hundred years. Mr. Alfred\r\nRussel Wallace, the last of the great students who took all natural\r\nhistory for their province, declares that the advances in discovery,\r\ninvention and generalization during the nineteenth century outweigh\r\nthose of all preceding time. Admit this judgment, and at once is\r\nexplained why the records and the spirit of science dominate the\r\nliterature of the last ten decades. And let us note that while books of\r\nknowledge have increased beyond measure, they have appeared with a\r\nhelpfulness and with merits wholly new. For the first time in the\r\nhistory of letters, men and women of successful experience, of practised\r\nand skilful pens, write books which, placed in the hands of the people,\r\nenlighten their toil, diminish their drudgery, and sweeten their lives.\r\nCross the threshold of the home and there is not a task, from choosing a\r\ncarpet to rearing a baby, that has not been illuminated by at least one\r\ngood woman of authority in her theme. On the heights of the literature\r\nof science we have a quality and distinction unknown before these later\r\ndays. The modern war on evil and pain displays weapons of an edge and\r\nforce of which our forefathers never dared to dream; its armies march\r\nforward not in ignorant hope, but with the assured expectation of\r\nvictory. All this inspires leaders like Huxley, Spencer and Fiske with\r\nan eloquence, a power to convince and persuade, new in the annals of\r\nhuman expression and as characteristic of the nineteenth century as the\r\nEnglish poetry of the sixteenth, in the glorious era of Elizabeth. The\r\nliterature of knowledge is not only fuller and better than of old, it is\r\nmore wisely employed. In the classroom, and when school days are done,\r\nwe now understand how the printed page may best direct and piece out the\r\nwork of the hand, the eye and the ear; not for a moment deluding\r\nourselves with the notion that we have grasped truth merely because we\r\ncan spell the word. To-day we first consider the lilies of the field,\r\nnot the lilies of the printer; that done it is time enough to take up a\r\nformal treatise which will clarify and frame our knowledge. If a boy is\r\nby nature a mechanic, a book of the right sort shows him how to\r\nconstruct a simple steam engine or an electric motor. Is he an amateur\r\nphotographer, other books, excellently illustrated, give him capital\r\nhints for work with his camera. It is in thus rounding out the circle\r\nwhich springs from the school desk that the public library justifies its\r\nequal claim to support from the public treasury.\r\n\r\nIn the third and last domain of letters, that of fiction, there is a\r\nveritable embarrassment of riches. During the three generations past\r\nthe art of story-telling culminated in works of all but Shakesperean\r\ndepth and charm. We have only to recall Scott and Thackeray, Hawthorne,\r\nGeorge Eliot and Thomas Hardy, to be reminded that an age of science may\r\njustly boast of novelists and romancers such as the world never knew\r\nbefore. No phase of life but has been limned with photographic fidelity,\r\nno realm of imagination but has been bodied forth as if by experience on\r\nfire, so that many a book which bears the name of fiction might well be\r\nlabelled as essential truth. Within the past decade, however, the old\r\nveins have approached their bounds, while new lodes do not as yet\r\nappear. Of this the tokens are the eager sifting of the rubbish heap,\r\nthe elaborate picturing of the abnormal and the gross. Pens unable to\r\nafford either delight or cheer have abundant capacity, often with\r\nevident malice, to strike the nerves of horror and of pain. If at the\r\npresent hour high achievement in fiction is rare, if we hear more echoes\r\nthan ever and fewer voices, quantity abounds to the point of surfeit.\r\nWith an output in America alone of 616 works for 1900, all fears of\r\nfamine may well be allayed.\r\n\r\nThe main fact of the situation then is that the librarian's trust has of\r\nlate years undergone stupendous increase; this at once broadens his\r\nopportunities and adds to his burdens. Gold and silver, iron and lead,\r\ntogether with much dross, are commingled in a heap which rises every\r\nhour. Before a trust can be rightly and gainfully administered, its\r\ntrustees must know in detail what it is that they guard, what its\r\nseveral items are worth, what they are good for. And let us remember\r\nthat literature consists in but small part of metals which declare\r\nthemselves to all men as gold or lead; much commoner are alloys of every\r\nconceivable degree of worth or worthlessness. There is plainly nothing\r\nfor it but to have recourse to the crucibles of the professional\r\nassayer, it becomes necessary to add to the titles of our catalogs some\r\nresponsible word as to what books are and what rank they occupy in an\r\norder of just precedence.\r\n\r\nThis task of a competent and candid appraisal of literature, as a\r\nnecessity of its trusteeship, has been before the minds of this\r\nAssociation for a good many years. A notable Step toward its\r\naccomplishment was taken when Mr. Samuel S. Green, in 1879, allied\r\nhimself with the teachers of Worcester, Massachusetts, that they and he\r\ntogether might select books for the public schools of that city. The\r\nwork began and has proceeded upon comprehensive lines. Such literature\r\nhas been chosen as may usefully and acceptably form part of the daily\r\ninstruction, there is a liberal choice of books of entertainment and\r\ninspiration worthily to buttress and relieve the formal lessons. The\r\nwhole work goes forward with intent to cultivate the taste, to widen the\r\nhorizons, to elevate the impulses of the young reader. Mr. Green's\r\nmethods, with the modifications needful in transplanting, have been\r\nadopted far and wide throughout the Union. Already they have borne fruit\r\nin heightening the standards of free choice when readers have passed\r\nfrom the school bench to the work-a-day world.\r\n\r\nThus thoughtfully to lay the foundation of the reading habit is a task\r\nbeyond praise; upon a basis so sound it falls to our lot to rear, if we\r\ncan, a worthy and durable superstructure. It is time that we passed from\r\nbooks for boys and girls to books for the youth, the man and the woman.\r\nAnd how amid the volume and variety of the accumulated literature of the\r\nages shall we proceed? For light and comfort let us go back a little in\r\nthe history of education, we shall there find a method substantially\r\nthat of our friend, Mr. Green. Long before there were any free libraries\r\nat all, we had in America a small band of readers and learners who\r\nenjoyed unfailing pilotage in the sea of literature. These readers and\r\nlearners were in the colleges, where the teachers from examination and\r\ncomparison in the study, the class-room and the laboratory were able to\r\nsay that such an author was the best in his field, that such another had\r\nuseful chapters, and that a third was unreliable or superseded. While\r\nliterature has been growing from much to more, this bench of judicature\r\nhas been so enlarged as to keep steadily abreast of it. At Harvard there\r\nare twenty-six sub-libraries of astronomy, zoology, political economy,\r\nand so on; at hand are the teachers who can tell how the books may be\r\nused with most profit. Of the best critics of books in America the\r\nlarger part are to be found at Harvard, at its sister universities and\r\ncolleges, at the technological institutes and art schools of our great\r\ncities. We see their signed reviews in such periodicals as the\r\n_Political Science Quarterly_ and the _Physical Review_; or unsigned in\r\njournals of the stamp of the _Nation_. Fortunately, we can call upon\r\nreinforcements of this vanguard of criticism. It would be difficult to\r\nname a branch of learning, an art, a science, an exploration, from\r\nfolk-lore to forestry, from psychical research to geological surveys,\r\nwhose votaries are not to-day banded to promote the cause they have at\r\nheart. These organizations include not only the foremost teachers in the\r\nUnion, but also their peers, outside the teaching profession, of equal\r\nauthority in bringing literature to the balances. And the point for us\r\nis that these societies, through their publications and discussions,\r\nenable these laymen to be known for what they are. Because the American\r\nHistorical Association is thus comprehensive, its membership has opened\r\nthe door for an initial task of appraisal, important in itself and\r\nsignificant for the future.\r\n\r\nDrawing his two score contributors almost wholly from that Association,\r\nMr. J. N. Larned, of Buffalo, an honored leader of ours, has, without\r\nfee or reward, acted as chief editor of an annotated Bibliography of\r\nAmerican History. The work is now passing through the composing room of\r\nHoughton, Mifflin & Co., of Boston; its contributors include professors\r\nof history at Bowdoin, Bryn Mawr, Columbia, Harvard, McGill, Toronto,\r\nTulane and Yale, as well as the Universities of Michigan, Wisconsin and\r\nChicago; our own Association is worthily represented by Messrs. James\r\nBain, Clarence S. Brigham, V. L. Collins, W. E. Foster, J. K. Hosmer, E.\r\nC. Richardson and R. G. Thwaites. As a rule the notes are signed. Where\r\nfor any reason a book demanding notice could not be allotted to a\r\ncontributor, Mr. Larned has quoted the fairest review he could find in\r\nprint. He has included not only good books, but such other works as have\r\nfound an acceptance they do not deserve. All told his pages will offer\r\nus about 3400 titles; a syllabus of the sources of American history is\r\nprefixed by Mr. Paul Leicester Ford; as an appendix will appear a\r\nfeature also of great value. In their \"Guide to American history,\"\r\npublished in 1896, Professors Channing and Hart, of Harvard University,\r\nrecommended such collections of books as may be had for $5, $10, $20,\r\n$50 or $100. Professor Channing is kind enough to say that he will\r\nrevise these lists and bring them down to date as a contribution to Mr.\r\nLarned's work. Professor Channing may, we trust, name the books in each\r\ncollection in the order in which they may be most gainfully read.\r\n\r\nIn times past our bibliographies have begun to need enlargement the\r\nmoment they left the bindery; in the present case that need is for the\r\nfirst time to be supplied. Mr. Larned's titles come to the close of\r\n1899; beyond that period current literature is to be chosen from and\r\nappraised with the editorship of Philip P. Wells, librarian of the Yale\r\nLaw Library, who will issue his series in card form. We hope that he may\r\nbe ready with his cards for 1900 at the time that Mr. Larned's book\r\nappears. Thereafter Mr. Wells' series will probably be published quarter\r\nby quarter. Beginning with 1897, Mr. W. Dawson Johnston, now of the\r\nLibrary of Congress, has edited for us a series of annotated cards\r\ndealing with the contemporary literature of English history. Both the\r\nform and substance of his series are capital. In so far as his cards go\r\ndirectly into catalog cases, where readers and students must of\r\nnecessity see them, they render the utmost possible aid. If subscribers\r\nin sufficient array come forward, Mr. Larned's book may be remolded for\r\nissue in similar card form, with a like opportunity for service in\r\ncatalog cases. In the Cleveland Public Library and its branches useful\r\nnotes are pasted within the lids of a good many volumes. It is well thus\r\nto put immediately under the reader's eye the word which points him\r\ndirectly to his goal, or prevents him wasting time in wanderings of\r\nlittle value or no value at all.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Larned's achievement a new chapter is opened in American\r\nlibrarianship; he breaks a path which should be followed up with a\r\ndiscernment and patience emulous of his example. If the whole working\r\nround of our literature were sifted and labelled after his method, the\r\nworth of that literature, because clearly brought into evidence, might\r\nwell be doubled at least. Every increase in the availability of our\r\nbooks, every removal of fences, every setting-up of guide-posts, has had\r\na heartening public response. So it will be if we proceed with this\r\neffort to bring together the seekers and the knowers, to obtain the best\r\navailable judgments for the behoof of readers and students everywhere.\r\nEconomics and politics, so closely interwoven with American history,\r\nmight well afford the second field for appraisal. A good many libraries\r\nstill find aid in the \"Reader's guide\" in this department, although it\r\nappeared as long ago as 1891. Next might follow the literature of the\r\nsciences pure and applied, together with the useful arts. Among useful\r\narts those of the household might well have the lead, for we must not be\r\nacademic, or ever lose sight of the duties nearest at hand to the great\r\nbody of the plain people. Mr. Sturgis and Mr. Krehbiel, in 1897, did an\r\nexcellent piece of work for us in their \"Bibliography of the fine arts\";\r\ntheir guide might profitably be revised and enlarged in its several\r\ndivisions, not omitting the introductory paragraphs which make the book\r\nunique in its class. These tasks well in hand, we might come to such\r\naccessions of strength and insight as to nerve us for labors of wider\r\nrange and greater difficulty, where personal equations may baffle even\r\nthe highest court of appeal, where it is opinion rather than fact that\r\nis brought to the scales. I refer to the debatable ground of ethics,\r\nphilosophy and theology; and, at the other pole of letters, to the vast\r\nstretches of fiction and belles lettres in our own and foreign tongues.\r\nWith regard to fiction and belles lettres, one of Mr. Larned's methods\r\nhas a hint for us. In some cases he has found it best to quote Mr.\r\nFrancis Parkman, Mr. Justin Winsor, or the pages of the _Nation_, the\r\n_Dial_, the _American Historical Review_, and similar trustworthy\r\nsources. With respect to novels and romances, essays and literary\r\ninterpretation, it does not seem feasible to engage a special corps of\r\nreviewers. It may be a good plan to appoint judicious editors to give us\r\ncomposite photographs of what the critics best worth heeding have said\r\nin the responsible press.\r\n\r\nIt is in the preponderant circulation of fiction, and fiction for the\r\nmost part of poor quality, that the critics of public libraries find\r\nmost warrant for attack. They point to the fact that many readers of\r\nthis fiction are comparatively well-to-do, and are exempted by public\r\ntaxation from supporting the subscription library and the bookseller.\r\nThe difficulty has been met chiefly in two ways; by curtailing the\r\nsupply of mediocre and trashy fiction; by exacting a small fee on\r\nissuing the novels brought for a season to a huge demand by advertising\r\nof a new address and prodigality. Appraisal, just and thorough, may be\r\nexpected to render aid more important because radical instead of\r\nsuperficial. In the first place, the best books of recreation, now\r\noverlaid by new and inferior writing, can be brought into prominence;\r\nsecondly, an emphasis, as persuasive as it can be made, ought to be\r\nplaced upon the more solid stores of our literature. \"Business,\" said\r\nBagehot long ago, \"is really more agreeable than pleasure; it interests\r\nthe whole mind, the aggregate nature of man more continuously and\r\ndeeply, but it does not look as if it did.\" Let it be our purpose to\r\nreveal what admirable substance underlies appearances not always\r\nseductive to the casual glance. Lowell and Matthew Arnold, Huxley and\r\nJohn Fiske, Lecky and Goldwin Smith are solid enough, yet with no lack\r\nof wit or humor to relieve their argument and elucidation. A New York\r\npublisher of wide experience estimates that the average American family,\r\napart from school purchases, buys less than two books a year. Newspapers\r\nand magazines form the staple of the popular literary diet. What fills\r\nthe newspapers is mainly news; their other departments of information\r\nare often extensive and admirable, but within the limits of the hastily\r\npenned paragraph or column they cannot rise to the completeness and\r\nquality of a book carefully written and faithfully revised. The plain\r\nfact is, and it behooves us to reckon with it, the average man, to whom\r\nwe bear our credentials as missionaries, looks upon a book as having\r\nsomething biblical about it. To sit down deliberately and surrender\r\nhimself to its chapters is a task he waves away with strangely mingled\r\nawe and dislike. So he misses the consecutive instruction, as delightful\r\nas profitable to an educated taste, which authors, publishers and\r\nlibrarians are ready and even anxious to impart.\r\n\r\nWe hear a good deal in these days about the need of recreation, and not\r\na word more than is true, but let us remember that the best recreation\r\nmay consist in a simple change of work. Behold the arduous toil of the\r\ncity lawyer, or banker, as on a holiday tour he climbs a peak of the\r\nAlps or the Adirondacks, or wades the chilly streams of Scotland or\r\nCanada a salmon rod in his hands. Why does he undergo fatigues so\r\nsevere? Partly because they are freely chosen, partly because they are\r\nfatigues of an unwonted and therefore refreshing kind. So in the field\r\nbefore us to-day. Truth is not only stranger than fiction, it is more\r\nfascinating when once its charms are recognized and entertained. Our\r\npublic schools throughout the land prove that a true story of\r\nexploration, of invention or discovery, of heroism or adventure, has\r\nonly to be well told to rivet a boy's attention as firmly as ever did\r\nRobinson Crusoe or Treasure Island. When readers take up from\r\ninstinctive appetite, or wise incitement, the best books about flowers\r\nor birds, minerals or trees, an art, a science, a research, they come to\r\njoys in new knowledge, in judgments informed and corrected, unknown to\r\nthe tipplers and topers whose staple is the novel, good, bad and\r\nindifferent. And why, if we can help it, should public money ever be\r\nspent for aught but the public good?\r\n\r\nWith a new sense of what is implied in the trusteeship of literature, if\r\nwe endeavor in the future to ally ourselves with the worthiest critics\r\nof books, we must bid good-bye to the temporary expedients which have\r\ncramped and burdened our initial labors. The work of the appraisal of\r\nliterature requires a home, a Central Bureau, with a permanent and\r\nadequately paid staff of editors and assistants. The training of such a\r\nstaff has already begun; in addition to the experience acquired by those\r\nenlisted in our present bibliographical tasks, instruction is now given\r\nin advanced bibliography at the New York State Library School at Albany,\r\nand doubtless also at other library schools. And at the Central Bureau,\r\nwhich we are bold enough to figure to ourselves, much more should be\r\ndone than to bring books to the balances. At such a home, in New York,\r\nWashington, or elsewhere, every other task should proceed which aims at\r\nfurthering the good that literature can do all the people. There might\r\nbe conducted the co-operative cataloging now fast taking form; there\r\nshould be extended the series of useful tracts begun by that of Dr. G.\r\nE. Wire on \"How to start a library,\" by Mr. F. A. Hutchins on\r\n\"Travelling libraries.\" At such a center should be exhibited everything\r\nto inform the founder of a public library; everything to direct the\r\nlegislator who would create a library commission on the soundest lines\r\nor recast library laws in the light of national experience; there,\r\nmoreover, should be gathered everything to arouse and instruct the\r\nlibrarian who would bring his methods to the highest plane. Thence, too,\r\nshould go forth the speakers and organizers intent upon awakening torpid\r\ncommunities to a sense of what they miss so long as they stand outside\r\nour ranks, or lag at the rear of our movement. In the fulness of time\r\nsuch a bureau might copy the Franklin Society, of Paris, and call into\r\nexistence a needed book, to find within this Association a sale which,\r\nthough small, would be adequate, because free from the advertising taxes\r\nof ordinary publishing. To found and endow such a bureau would\r\nundoubtedly cost a great deal, and where is the money to come from? We\r\nmay, I think, expect it from the sources which have given us thousands\r\nof public libraries, great and small. Here is an opportunity for our\r\nfriends, whether their surpluses be large or little. When a gift can be\r\naccompanied by personal aid and counsel, it comes enriched. It is much\r\nwhen a goodly gift provides a city with a library, it would be yet more\r\nif the donation were to establish and maintain an agency to lift\r\nlibraries everywhere to the highest efficiency possible, to give\r\nliterature for the first time its fullest acceptance, its utmost\r\nfruitage.\r\n\r\nIn a retrospective glance at nineteenth century science, Professor\r\nHaeckel has said that the hundred years before us are not likely to\r\nwitness such victories as those which have signalized the era just at an\r\nend. Assume for a moment that his forecast is sound, and that it applies\r\nbeyond the immediate bounds of science, what does it mean for\r\nlibrarianship? It simply reinforces what in any case is clear, namely,\r\nthat it is high time that the truth and beauty of literature known to\r\nthe few made its way to all the people, for their enlightenment,\r\nconsolation and delight. If the future battles of science are to be\r\nwaged less strenuously than of yore, if scholarship has measurably\r\nexhausted its richest mines, let us give the broadest diffusion to the\r\nfruits of their triumphs past. In thus diffusing the leaven of culture\r\nthe public library should take a leading, not a subordinate part. Its\r\ntreasure is vaster and more precious than ever before. The world's\r\nliterature grows much like the world's stock of gold, every year's\r\nwinning is added to the mass already heaped together at the year's first\r\nday. In the instruction, entertainment and inspiration of every man and\r\nwoman there is a three-fold ministry, that of art, of science, and of\r\nletters. Because letters bring to public appreciation, to popular\r\nsympathy, both art and science, and this in addition to their own\r\npriceless argosies, may we not say that of art, science and letters, the\r\ngreatest of these is letters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE TRUSTEESHIP OF LITERATURE--II.\r\n\r\n    BY RICHARD T. ELY, _Director School of Economics, University of\r\n                              Wisconsin_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to speak plainly and, if possible, forcibly, concerning\r\nwhat seems to me a grave menace to the progress of science, but in all\r\nthat I shall say, I would have it understood that I have only the\r\nfriendliest feelings personally for the gentleman who has brought\r\nforward what seem to me dangerous proposals. I appreciate his zeal for\r\nprogress and his self-sacrificing efforts for human advancement in\r\nvarious directions, but I think that in this particular case--namely,\r\nthe evaluation of literature, or the establishment of a judicature of\r\nletters, my friend is working against his own ideals.\r\n\r\nI admit freely that the readers in our public libraries very generally\r\nneed help in the selection of books, and that great assistance may be\r\nrendered them by judicious advice. Much time is wasted by those who read\r\nscientific and serious works which do not present the results of recent\r\ninvestigations: furthermore, as another consequence effort is\r\nmisdirected and instead of producing beneficial results may do positive\r\ndamage. The question may be asked: \"Shall I read Adam Smith's 'Wealth of\r\nnations?' I hear it mentioned as one of the great works in the world's\r\nhistory.\" Probably many a librarian has had this precise question asked\r\nhim. In giving an affirmative answer it will be most helpful to offer a\r\nfew words explaining the circumstances under which it appeared one\r\nhundred and twenty-five years ago, and its relation to the subsequent\r\ndevelopment of economic schools and tendencies. Doubtless this work is\r\nfrequently perused as if it were fresh from the press and were to be\r\njudged as a work appearing in 1901.\r\n\r\nI further admit the harm which has come to individuals from the study of\r\nthe so-called \"crank\" literature in economics and sociology, as well as\r\nin other branches of learning. Doubtless many a man is working\r\nvigorously in a wrong way and attempting to force society into false\r\nchannels who might be doing a good work had his reading been well\r\ndirected in a formative period.\r\n\r\nBut the magnitude of the interests involved in the proposal which greets\r\nus requires caution and conservatism in action. We must take a long, not\r\na short, view of the matter, inquiring into remote and permanent\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed, as I understand it, to have so-called expert opinions\r\nexpressed concerning books, new and old; to secure as precise and\r\ndefinite estimates of their value as possible, and then by means of\r\nprinted guides, and even card catalogs, to bring these opinions and\r\nevaluations before the readers in our libraries.\r\n\r\nLet us reflect for a moment on what this implies. It means, first of all\r\na judicial body of men from whom these estimates are to proceed. Have we\r\nsuch a body? Is it in the nature of things possible that we should have\r\nsuch a body? I say that so far as contemporary literature is concerned,\r\nthe history of knowledge gives us a positive and conclusive negative\r\nanswer--a most emphatic \"No.\" Let anyone who knows the circumstances and\r\nconditions under which reviews are prepared and published reflect on\r\nwhat the attempt to secure this evaluation of literature implies. Many\r\nof us know a great deal about these circumstances and conditions. We\r\nhave written reviews, we have asked others to write reviews, and we have\r\nfor years been in contact with a host of reviewers. We may in this\r\nconnection first direct out attention to the general character of the\r\nperiodicals from which quotations are frequently made in the evaluation\r\nof literature. I say nothing about my own view, but I simply express an\r\nopinion of many men whose judgment should have great weight when I say\r\nthat one of the most brilliant of these periodicals has been marked by a\r\nnarrow policy, having severe tests of orthodoxy along economic, social\r\nand political lines, and displaying a bitterness and vindictiveness\r\nreaching beyond the grave. I mention no names, and the opinion may or\r\nmay not be a just one; but it should be carefully weighed whether or\r\nnot, or to what extent, the evaluations of such a periodical ought to be\r\ncrystallized as it were: that is, taken from the periodical press and\r\nmade part of a working library apparatus, to last for years.\r\n\r\nAnother periodical, an able magazine, which makes much of reviews is\r\nunder the control of a strong body of men, but they stand for scarcely\r\nmore than one line of thought among many lines. And sometimes very sharp\r\nand very hard things are said about those who believe that scientific\r\ntruth is moving along one of these other lines. Indeed, the discreet\r\nperson, knowing personally the reviewer and the reviewed, will not be\r\nconvinced that there is always in the reviews, here as elsewhere, an\r\nabsence of personal animosity. Let us for a moment reflect on this\r\npersonal element in reviews, as it has surely fallen under the notice of\r\nevery man with wide experience in these matters. As a rule, the\r\nreviewers are comparatively young and inexperienced men, frequently\r\nzealous for some sect or faction. Sometimes great leaders of thought\r\nwrite reviews, but generally they are unable to find the time to do so.\r\nAs a result in our reviews in the best periodicals it will frequently be\r\nfound that an inferior is passing judgment on a superior, and\r\nfurthermore, reviewers share in our common human nature, and the amount\r\nof personal bias and even at times personal malignity found in reviews\r\nand estimates of books is something sad to contemplate. An unsuccessful\r\ncandidate for a position held by an author has been known to initiate a\r\nscandalous and altogether malicious attack in a review.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, I would call your attention to the absence of\r\nobjective standards. Necessarily are the standards personal and\r\nsubjective; particularly and above all in economics, but in high degree\r\nin sociology, ethics and philosophy in general, and religion. Biological\r\nreviews have displayed in marked degree the subjective personal element.\r\nChemistry, physics, astronomy and mathematics probably are best of all\r\nfitted for evaluations free from personal bias.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked what damage will result from evaluation. Passing over\r\ngrave injustice to individuals, we observe that they must lead to the\r\nformation of what Bagehot aptly called a crust, preventing the free\r\ndevelopment of science. We have been laboring for years to obtain\r\nscientific freedom, freedom in teaching, freedom in learning, freedom in\r\nexpression. For this end many a battle has been fought by noble leaders\r\nof thought. Indeed, every new movement of thought has to struggle to\r\nmake itself felt, and to struggle precisely against those who control\r\nthe most respectable avenues of publication; against the very ones who\r\nwould be selected to give expert opinions and make evaluations of\r\nliterature. Call to mind the opposition to Darwin and Huxley--although\r\nthey were especially and particularly fortunate in early gaining the\r\nadherence of scientific men--also the opposition to Adam Smith, Malthus,\r\nRicardo and John Stuart Mill--and to the last named, even now, some\r\nwould on a scale of 100 give an evaluation perhaps of 50, others of\r\n65--still others 80 and 90. Recently an economic book appeared of which\r\none widely quoted periodical said that it illustrated a _reductio ad\r\nabsurdum_ of false tendencies, while another expert opinion inclined to\r\nplace it among the great works of the age. It would seem to me that if\r\nwe are to have formal evaluations, they should at least be restricted to\r\nworks which have been before the public for a period of fifty years.\r\n\r\nWe have in this proposal, as I take it, an attack on liberty, proceeding\r\nfrom one who would not willingly attack it, but illustrating the truth\r\nof the saying \"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\" It is\r\nproposed to publish virtually an _index librorum prohibitorum_ and an\r\n_index expurgatorius_. And of all efforts ever conceived along this\r\nline, this is precisely the worst because of its apparently impersonal\r\ncharacter. Let the ordinary reader go to a guide and find a book\r\ndescribed as unscientific and superficial, and what weight can it have\r\nfor him. The authority has spoken. It is well enough for librarians\r\npersonally to guide and direct their constituencies, and one review may\r\nbe weighed against another review. The old methods even must be used by\r\nlibrarians cautiously, and they are ample for the purpose to be\r\nattained. The great point is that there should be a fluid current of\r\nopinion, and every facility for a revision of judgment should be\r\nmaintained. Reviewers themselves change their views. I, myself, remember\r\nreviews which I wrote of works by two distinguished American authors,\r\nwhich I now regret, as my estimates were, I believe, not altogether\r\nsound and did an injustice to the authors, namely John Fiske and Lester\r\nF. Ward. But after all, I suppose no special harm was done, but if\r\nextracts from these reviews had been made part of a system of evaluation\r\nit would have been different.\r\n\r\nLibrarians as librarians must watch with impartiality the struggles\r\namong tendencies and schools of thought, and above all things, endeavor\r\nto keep open a free way for new truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BOOK COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\n    BY THORVALD SOLBERG, _Register of Copyright, Washington. D. C._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to keep within the time limit provided in the program I have\r\nbeen obliged to refrain from even touching upon many points, but have\r\nendeavored to present certain general principles governing copyright in\r\nbooks. I shall, therefore, only attempt to make clear, as briefly as\r\npossible:\r\n\r\n1. What is copyrighted, _i.e._, what can properly be designated as a\r\n\"book\" in order to secure copyright protection thereon;\r\n\r\n2. What is the nature of the protection secured under the copyright law;\r\n\r\n3. The limitation in time during which the protection applies, and its\r\nterritorial limitations;\r\n\r\n4. Who may obtain protection--the difference between an \"author\" and a\r\n\"proprietor\";\r\n\r\n5. International copyright;\r\n\r\n6. What conditions and formalities are required to be complied with in\r\norder to secure copyright;\r\n\r\n7. The functions of the Copyright Office; and\r\n\r\n8. Possible copyright law amendment.\r\n\r\n1. _What is copyrighted?_\r\n\r\nThe copyright statutes enumerate the articles or classes of articles\r\nsubject-matter of copyright, and first in the list stands \"book.\" The\r\nfirst consideration is, therefore, What is to be understood by the term\r\n\"book\" as thus used? or, in other words, What is a \"book,\" as that\r\ndesignation is employed in the copyright law?\r\n\r\nThe answer is indicated in the provision of the federal constitution\r\nupon which our copyright legislation is founded. This paragraph of the\r\nconstitution (section 8 of article 1) grants to Congress--\"in order to\r\npromote the progress of science and useful arts\"--the right to enact\r\nlaws to secure \"to authors ... the exclusive right to their ...\r\nwritings....\" This provision is, of course, to be broadly interpreted,\r\nbut, using the exact wording of the law, it is the _writing_ of an\r\nauthor--his literary composition--the prose or poetical expression of\r\nhis thought--which makes his \"book,\" as the term is used in the\r\ncopyright law. In order to be a \"book,\" subject to protection under the\r\ncopyright law, the author's production must have this literary\r\ncharacteristic. The _quality_ of the literary ingredient is not tested,\r\nbut its presence is requisite. Hence not everything which may ordinarily\r\nbe called a book is fitly so nominated, in order to indicate the\r\nsubject-matter of copyright; while some productions not ordinarily\r\ndesignated as \"books\" may properly be thus classified in order to be\r\nregistered as a preliminary to copyright protection.\r\n\r\nThat an article possesses the corporeal characteristics of a book is of\r\nlittle consequence. The _literary_ substance, not the material form,\r\nprimarily determines the matter. An article contributed to a newspaper\r\nor a periodical--although but a few paragraphs in length--is a \"book\"\r\nunder the copyright law, while a bookkeeper's ledger, to all outward\r\nappearance answering the description, is not a \"book\" so far as\r\nregistering its title to secure copyright is concerned. A calendar whose\r\nmain features are literary may doubtless be properly registered as a\r\n\"book,\" but a pack of playing cards with pictures on the backs, even\r\nthough each card may be furnished with a linen guard and all bound up,\r\nwith a plausible title-page, so as to resemble a book, is not a \"book\"\r\nin the meaning of the copyright law.\r\n\r\nOrderly arranged information produced in a form which would commonly be\r\ntermed a chart cannot be registered under that designation which in the\r\ncopyright law is applicable only to a chartographical work, but may\r\nproperly be called a \"book\"; while a so-called book of coupons, or\r\nrailway tickets, or of blank forms, cannot be thus entitled.\r\n\r\nIn brief, it should be a book in the ordinary understanding of a work of\r\n_literature_ or art, and may not include a production whose main feature\r\nis some original idea, however ingenious or fanciful its form may be, or\r\nis of the character of something invented. Invention must look for\r\nprotection to the patent law.\r\n\r\n2. _The nature of the protection secured._\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of the protection secured? Copy-right, _i. e._, the\r\nright of copy--the right to make copies. According to the words of our\r\nown statute, the author of a book \"shall have the _sole_ liberty of\r\nprinting, reprinting, publishing, completing, copying, executing,\r\nfinishing and vending the same.\" The _exclusive_ liberty of reproducing\r\nhis work, and the restriction of the liberty of every one except the\r\nauthor to multiply copies constitute the literary property. It is a\r\nmuch-discussed question whether the author's privilege of copyright is a\r\nnatural right or was created by legislation. Granting the production a\r\nproper one, it would seem that the author of a literary creation has a\r\nnatural right to the unrestricted use and enjoyment of it. As Professor\r\nLangdell recently put it: \"he has the right of use and enjoyment,\r\nbecause he can exercise such right without committing any wrong against\r\nany other person, and because no other person can prevent his exercising\r\nsuch right without committing a wrong against him.\" The author's\r\ncreation is his own, and he has a natural right to the use of it without\r\ninterference. The state does not create this right, but recognizes it\r\nand protects it. Protection is secured by restricting the liberty of\r\nother people in the use of the author's creation. Just how far this\r\nrestriction should go is still a moot question. The law says, however,\r\nthat you may not reproduce in whole or in part an author's book without\r\nhis written consent, signed in the presence of two witnesses. It does\r\nnot say that you may not read the book, nor are you forbidden to read it\r\nin public, even for profit, although in the case of musical and dramatic\r\ncompositions public performance or representation for profit without the\r\nauthor's special--not implied--consent is not only directly prohibited,\r\nbut is punishable by imprisonment. The International Publishers'\r\nCongress, which met in Paris in June, 1896, passed a resolution to the\r\neffect that the reproduction of a literary work by means of public\r\nreadings, in case such readings were held for purposes of profit, ought\r\nnot to be permitted without the consent of the copyright proprietor. By\r\nthe Act of March 3, 1891, the exclusive right to translate or dramatize\r\nhis book is reserved to the author. In this unrestricted and unlimited\r\nexclusive right of translation and dramatization our law has exceeded\r\nthe usual trend of legislation in regard to the author's control over\r\nhis work in these directions. Foreign legislation usually only reserves\r\nto the author the exclusive right to translate or dramatize for a\r\nlimited fixed period of time, and if he has not himself produced a\r\ntranslation or dramatization within that period, another person may.\r\n\r\nIt has occasionally been intimated that the efforts made by the public\r\nlibraries to secure the constant circulation of the same book is a\r\ntrespass upon the rights of the author, as he is presumably thus\r\nsubjected to the loss of readers who would otherwise also become\r\npurchasers of his book. A case has just been decided to test an author's\r\nright to object to having copies of his own copyright editions of his\r\nbooks sold in a manner not indicated by himself as volumes of a\r\nso-called collected edition of his works. The decision, on first\r\nhearing, was adverse to the author's contention.\r\n\r\nIt is the _literary expression_ of the author's thoughts and ideas which\r\nis the subject-matter of the protection, and not primarily the thoughts\r\nand ideas themselves. These last may or may not be original with the\r\nauthor, but once he has made public a thought or an idea he has given it\r\naway; he cannot control its use or application. The author of a\r\ntranslation of a book--the original work being in the public domain--may\r\nobtain a copyright upon his own translation, but doing so will not debar\r\nanother from producing an original translation of his own of the same\r\nwork and obtaining copyright registration for the same.\r\n\r\nCopyright does not give to any one monopoly in the use of the _title_ of\r\na book, nor can a title _per se_ be subject-matter of copyright. It is\r\nthe book itself, the literary substance which is protected, the title\r\nbeing recorded for the identification of the work.\r\n\r\n3. _Time and territorial limitations of copyright._\r\n\r\nA few countries still grant copyright in perpetuity, but usually the\r\nterm of protection is limited either to a certain number of years, or to\r\na term of years beyond the date of the author's death. This last\r\nprovision is the more general, and the term varies from seven years\r\nafter the author's death in England, for instance, to eighty years after\r\nthe author's death in Spain. The two most common terms are thirty years\r\nto fifty years beyond the life of the author. Our own legislation\r\nprovides for two possible terms of protection. The first being for\r\ntwenty-eight years from the date of the recording of the title in the\r\nCopyright Office, and the second, an extension of fourteen years from\r\nthe expiration of the first term.\r\n\r\nBesides the time limit, copyright--especially as far as the authors of\r\nthe United States are concerned--is limited territorially, not extending\r\nbeyond the boundaries of the United States. Whether the protection which\r\nfollows registration and deposit shall extend so as to include Porto\r\nRico, Hawaii and the Philippines is a matter of some question. Probably\r\nas regards the Philippines the answer would be in the negative, but as\r\nconcerns Porto Rico, since the passage of the \"Act temporarily to\r\nprovide revenue and a civil government for Porto Rico\" (April 12, 1900)\r\nand Hawaii, since the taking effect (June 14, 1900) of the \"Act to\r\nprovide a government for the territory of Hawaii,\" the response would be\r\nin the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThe obtaining of copyright protection by a compliance with the United\r\nStates statutory requirements as to registration of title, deposit of\r\ncopies, and printing of notice of copyright, does not secure extension\r\nof this protection in the territory of any foreign country, the United\r\nStates not being a member of the International Copyright Union. An\r\nAmerican author must comply with the requirements of the copyright laws\r\nof a foreign country, just as if he were a citizen or subject of that\r\ncountry, in order to obtain copyright protection within its borders.\r\nPresumably, however, the obtaining of valid copyright protection in one\r\nof the countries of the International Copyright Union, England for\r\nexample, would secure protection throughout the various countries of\r\nthat Union.\r\n\r\n4. _Who may obtain copyright._\r\n\r\nIt is the _author_ of the work who is privileged to obtain copyright\r\nprotection for it. As I have already pointed out, the constitutional\r\nprovision enacts that Congress is to legislate to secure to _authors_\r\nthe exclusive right to their _writings_. When, therefore, the law states\r\nthat the author \"or proprietor\" of any book may obtain a copyright for\r\nit, the term \"proprietor\" must be construed to mean the author's\r\nassignee, _i.e._, the person to whom he has legally transferred his\r\ncopyright privilege. It is not necessarily transferred by the sale of\r\nthe book, _i.e._, the manuscript of the author's work, as the purchase\r\nalone of an author's manuscript does not secure to the proprietor of the\r\nmanuscript copyright privileges. Prior to July 1, 1891, no foreign\r\nauthor could obtain copyright protection in the United States, hence the\r\npurchase by a publisher of one of Dickens's novels in manuscript, for\r\nexample, would not enable the buyer to obtain copyright on the book in\r\nthis country. No author who has not the privilege of copyright in the\r\nUnited States can transfer to another either a copyright or the right to\r\nobtain one. He cannot sell what he does not himself possess. Under the\r\nUnited States law copyright comes through _authorship_ only. It is not a\r\nright attaching to the thing--the book--but is a right vested in the\r\ncreator of the literary production, hence does not pass to a second\r\nperson by the transference of the material thing, the book, and evidence\r\nmust be offered showing that the transference of the book carried with\r\nit the author's consent to a conveyance of the privilege of copyright.\r\n\r\nThis same principle is embodied in the provisions of the law as to\r\nrenewal of the copyright. The second term of protection must also start\r\nwith the author, or if he be dead, with his natural heirs, his widow or\r\nchildren, but not with his assigns, the \"proprietors.\" The right to the\r\nextension term is in the author if he be living at the period during\r\nwhich registration for the second term may take place, _viz._, within\r\nsix months prior to the expiration of the first term of twenty-eight\r\nyears. If the author be dead, the privilege of renewal rests with his\r\nwidow or children. Whether the author may dispose of his right of\r\nrenewal so that the transference may be effective for the second term,\r\neven though the author should have died before the date of the beginning\r\nof that term, is a question upon which the authorities differ. The\r\nlanguage of the statute would seem to give to the author an inchoate\r\nright which reverts to his widow or children should he be married and\r\ndie before the expiration of the first term of the copyright.\r\n\r\n5. _International copyright._\r\n\r\nThe idea of nationality or citizenship governed our copyright\r\nlegislation for more than a century, from the earliest American\r\ncopyright statute of 1783 to July 1, 1891, so that until the latter date\r\ncopyright protection in the United States was limited to the works of\r\nauthors who were citizens or residents. By the Act of March 3, 1891,\r\ncommonly called the international-copyright law, which went into effect\r\non July 1 of that year, the privileges of copyright in this country were\r\nextended to the productions of authors who were citizens or subjects of\r\nother countries which by their laws permitted American citizens to\r\nobtain copyright upon substantially the same basis as their own\r\nsubjects. The existence of these conditions is made known by\r\npresidential proclamation, and up to this time ten such proclamations\r\nhave been issued extending copyright in the United States to the citizen\r\nauthors of Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Great\r\nBritain and her possessions (including India, Canada, the Australias,\r\netc.), Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.\r\nThe privilege of copyright in the United States is extended only to\r\nauthors who are subjects of some country in whose behalf a presidential\r\nproclamation as to copyright has been issued.\r\n\r\nIt is well to point out, perhaps, that these copyright proclamations are\r\nnot equivalent to copyright treaties, but are only notices that certain\r\nconditions exist. Only in the case of one country, _viz._, Germany, has\r\nanything been entered into approaching a convention or treaty. Under\r\ndate of Jan. 15, 1892, an \"agreement\" was signed with that country to\r\nissue a proclamation extending copyright in the United States to German\r\nsubjects upon an assurance that \"Citizens of the United States of\r\nAmerica shall enjoy, in the German Empire, the protection of copyright\r\nas regards works of literature and art, as well as photographs, against\r\nillegal reproduction, on the same basis on which such protection is\r\ngranted to subjects of the empire.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain copyright abroad, therefore, an American citizen must\r\nascertain the requirements of the law of each country in which he\r\ndesires to protect his book or other production and comply explicitly\r\nwith such requirements. He can, of course, only avail himself of the\r\nlegal protection accorded, so far as it is within his power to thus\r\ncomply, and therein lies the difference between the privileges secured\r\nunder the present international-copyright arrangements, and such as\r\nwould be obtainable under copyright conventions or treaties. A citizen\r\nof the United States may find himself unable to meet the obligations or\r\nconditions of the statutes, just as a foreign author may find it\r\npractically impossible to comply with the requirements of the United\r\nStates law, and in either case there would be a failure to secure the\r\nprotection desired. In the case of a photograph, for example, the\r\nEnglish law requires that the \"author\" of the photograph must be a\r\nBritish subject or actually \"resident within the Dominions of the\r\nCrown,\" and the United States law requires that the two copies of the\r\nphotograph to be deposited in the Copyright Office \"shall be printed\r\nfrom _negatives made within the limits_ of the United States,\" two sets\r\nof conditions difficult of fulfilment. By means of a copyright\r\nconvention exemption could be obtained in either case from these onerous\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n6. _Conditions and formalities required by the copyright law._\r\n\r\nTwo steps are made prerequisites to valid copyright by the laws now in\r\nforce in the United States. The first of these is the recording of the\r\ntitle in the Copyright Office. For this purpose the statute requires the\r\ndeposit of \"a _printed_ copy\" of the title-page, \"on or before the day\r\nof publication in this or any foreign country.\" For a number of years it\r\nhas been the practice of the Copyright Office to accept a typewritten\r\ntitle in lieu of the _printed_ title-page, but in this, as with all\r\nother requirements of the law regarding copyright, the preferable course\r\nis a strict compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of the law.\r\n\r\nThe clerical service for thus recording the title requires the payment\r\nof a fee, which should accompany the title-page when transmitted to the\r\nCopyright Office. The fee for this, as fixed by law, is 50 cents in the\r\ncase of the title of a book whose author is a citizen of the United\r\nStates, and $1 in the case of a book whose author is not an American but\r\nis a citizen or subject of some country to whose citizens the privilege\r\nof copyright in the United States has been extended, under the\r\nprovisions of the Act of March 3, 1891. If a copy of the record thus\r\nmade of the title (commonly called a certificate) is desired, an\r\nadditional fee of 50 cents is required in all cases.\r\n\r\nIn order to have this essential record of title properly made, in the\r\nform exactly prescribed by the statute, it is necessary to furnish the\r\nCopyright Office with certain information, namely:\r\n\r\n_a._ The name of the claimant of the copyright. (This should be the real\r\nname of the person, not a _nom de plume_ or pseudonym.) _b._ Whether\r\ncopyright is claimed by applicant as the \"author\" or the \"proprietor\" of\r\nthe book. _c._ The nationality or citizenship of the _author_ of the\r\nbook. (This is required to determine whether the book is by an author\r\nwho is privileged to copyright protection in this country, and, also,\r\nthe amount of the fee to be charged for recording the title.) _d._ The\r\napplication should state that the title-page is the title of a \"book.\"\r\n_e._ A statement should be made that the book is or will be \"printed\r\nfrom type set within the limits of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe second prerequisite to copyright protection is the deposit in the\r\nCopyright Office of two copies of the book whose title-page has been\r\nrecorded. These copies must be printed from \"type set within the limits\r\nof the United States,\" and the deposit must be made \"not later than the\r\nday of publication thereof, in this or any foreign country.\" The\r\nstipulation as to American typesetting applies to works by American\r\nauthors as well as to those written by foreign authors.\r\n\r\nThe statute provides, as regards both the printed title and the printed\r\ncopies, that the articles are to be delivered at the office of the\r\nLibrarian of Congress, or \"deposited in the mail, within the United\r\nStates, addressed to the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C.\"\r\nJust what would be held to have been secured under the latter provision\r\nin case the deposit in the mail were made and the book failed to reach\r\nthe Copyright Office has not been determined by judicial decision. The\r\nlaw provides for the giving of a receipt by the postmaster in the case\r\nof the title and the copies, if such receipt is requested.\r\n\r\nThe third step required for obtaining a defendable copyright is to print\r\nupon the title-page or the page immediately following it in each copy of\r\nthe book the statutory notice of copyright. The form of this notice must\r\nbe either \"Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year ----, by A.\r\nB., in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington;\" or,\r\n\"Copyright, 19----, by A. B.\" The name printed in this notice must be\r\nthe real, legal name of the proprietor of the copyright, and must be the\r\nsame as that in which the entry of title has been made; the date, also,\r\nmust be the year date of the record of the filing of the title-page. A\r\njudicial decision is on record to the effect that printing the year date\r\nin this notice one year later than the date of actual recording of title\r\nbarred the defence of the copyright. A penalty of $100 is imposed on\r\n\"every person who shall insert or impress such notice, _or words of the\r\nsame purport_ in or upon any book ... whether subject to copyright or\r\notherwise, for which he has not obtained a copyright.\"\r\n\r\nAn American author may obtain for his book copyright protection in Great\r\nBritain, by a compliance with the official instructions as to\r\npublication, deposit of copies and registration. The protection, under\r\nEnglish law, dates from the day of _first_ publication, but such first\r\npublication must be on English territory, and registration may follow,\r\nbut cannot precede publication. The term of protection in the United\r\nStates, on the contrary, dates from the day of registration of title in\r\nour Copyright Office, which must precede publication, and be followed by\r\ndeposit of copies made \"not later than the day of publication thereof in\r\nthis or any foreign country.\" The point to guard, therefore, is\r\n_simultaneous publication_ in this country and in Great Britain.\r\nRegistration in England is a secondary matter. As stated in the official\r\ncirculars of instructions issued by the English Copyright Office,\r\n\"Copyright is created by the statute, and does not depend upon\r\nregistration, which is permissive only, and not compulsory, but no\r\nproprietor of copyright in any book can take any proceedings in respect\r\nof any infringement of his copyright unless he has, before commencing\r\nhis proceedings, registered his book.\"\r\n\r\nUnder existing legal conditions, in order to secure valid copyright on a\r\nbook in this country and in England, the following steps should be\r\ntaken, and in the order stated. 1. Record title in the United States\r\nCopyright Office. 2. Print book from type set within the limits of the\r\nUnited States. 3. Deposit two copies of such book in the United States\r\nCopyright Office. 4. Send sufficient copies to London to\r\n\r\n_a._ Place copies on sale and take such usual steps as are understood,\r\n    under English law, to constitute \"publication\" on a prearranged day,\r\n    on which same day the book is published in the United States.\r\n\r\n _b._ Deposit copies: one copy of the best edition at the British\r\n    Museum, and four copies of the usual edition at Stationers' Hall for\r\n    distribution to the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the University\r\n    Library at Cambridge, the Faculty of Advocates Library at Edinburgh,\r\n    and the Trinity College Library at Dublin.\r\n\r\n _c._ Register title of book and day of first publication at Stationers'\r\n    Hall, London.\r\n\r\n7. _The United States Copyright Office._\r\n\r\nOne frequently hears the expressions \"has obtained a copyright,\" \"issued\r\na copyright,\" etc., giving the impression that copyrights can be granted\r\nsomewhat after the manner in which the Patent Office issues\r\nletters-patent. But Congress has established no office authorized to\r\nfurnish any such guarantee of _literary_ property as is done in the case\r\nof patent monopoly. The Copyright Office is purely an office of record\r\nand simply registers _claims_ to copyright. The form of record\r\nprescribed by law being the effect that A. B. \"hath deposited the title\r\nof a book the right whereof he _claims_ as author or proprietor in\r\nconformity with the laws of the United States respecting copyrights.\"\r\nThe Copyright Office has no authority to question any claim as to\r\nauthorship or proprietorship, nor can it determine between conflicting\r\nclaims. It registers the claim presented in the prescribed form for a\r\nproper subject of copyright by any person legally entitled to such\r\nregistration without investigation as to the truthfulness of the\r\nrepresentations, and would be obliged to record, not only the same title\r\nfor different books, but the same title for the same work on behalf of\r\ntwo or more different persons, even against the protest of either one,\r\nwere such registrations asked for. No examination is therefore made when\r\na title reaches the office as to whether the same or a similar title has\r\nbeen used before. As I have already stated, the title _per se_ is not\r\nsubject to copyright, and no one can secure a monopoly of the use of a\r\ntitle by merely having it recorded at a nominal fee at the Copyright\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nIf any one, wishing to use a given form of title but desiring to avoid\r\npossible duplication of one previously used, writes to the Copyright\r\nOffice asking whether such a title has already been recorded, an answer\r\nis made stating what is disclosed by the indexes of the office. It must\r\nbe frankly explained, however, that an absolutely conclusive statement\r\nas to whether a given title has been previously used cannot always be\r\ngiven. The copyright records of entries of title previous to July 10,\r\n1870, are but indifferently indexed and rarely by title, usually only\r\nunder names of proprietors of the copyright. The copyright entries since\r\nJuly 10, 1870, to May 31, 1901, number 1,217,075. The index to these\r\nentries consists of more than 600,000 cards, many of which contain a\r\nnumber of entries. These cards index the entries primarily under the\r\nnames of the proprietors of the copyright, and this proprietor's index\r\nis understood to have been kept up continuously and to be complete, so\r\nthat under the name of each copyright proprietor there is a card or\r\ncards showing the titles of all articles upon which copyright is\r\nclaimed. In addition to the proprietor's index there are cards under the\r\ntitles of periodicals and under the leading catchwords of the titles of\r\nother articles, besides cards under the authors' names for books.\r\nUnhappily there are periods of time when what may be called the\r\nsubsidiary index cards were not kept up.\r\n\r\nIn addition to cards under the proprietors' names, cards are now made:\r\nfor _books_, under the names of their authors; for _anonymous books_,\r\n_periodicals_ and _dramatic compositions_, under the first words of the\r\ntitles (not a, an, or the), and for _maps_, under the leading subject\r\nwords of the titles, _i.e._, the names of the localities mapped. It is\r\ndoubtful if an absolutely complete index of all copyright entries by the\r\n_title_ of the book and other article--in addition to the cards at\r\npresent made--could be justified by even a possibly legitimate use of\r\nsuch an index. When it is remembered that the copyright entries last\r\nyear numbered 97,967, the magnitude of the task of making several cards\r\nfor each entry is easily conceived, and it is a question whether it\r\ncould be rightfully imposed upon the Copyright Office under the present\r\nprovisions of the law and so long as the registration of a title does\r\nnot secure the use of that title to some one person to the exclusion of\r\nall others.\r\n\r\n8. _Amendment of the copyright law._\r\n\r\nThe possible amendment of the copyright laws is a subject which my time\r\ndoes not permit me to consider in detail, even were that deemed\r\ndesirable. The law now in force consists of the Act of July 8, 1870, as\r\nedited to become title 60, chapter 3 of the Revised Statutes, and ten\r\namendatory acts passed subsequently. Naturally there is lacking the\r\nconsistency and homogeneousness of a single well-considered copyright\r\nstatute. It is possible that Congress will presently be willing to take\r\nunder consideration, if not the re-codification of the copyright laws,\r\nthen, at least, some amendment of them. An increase in the period of\r\nprotection has frequently been urged, with some advocacy of perpetual\r\ncopyright. As the Federal constitution, however, distinctly provides\r\nthat the protection granted the writings of an author is to be for a\r\n_limited time_, an amendment of the constitution would be necessary\r\nbefore Congress could enact perpetual copyright, and such alteration of\r\nthe fundamental law of the land is not probable.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said for an increase in the period of protection. It is\r\nfor a shorter term of years than that provided by most modern copyright\r\nlegislation, and the trend of such lawmaking has been in the direction\r\nof an increase in the length of time during which the author or his\r\nheirs could control the reproduction of his work. It should be borne in\r\nmind that for books of little value the length of the term of protection\r\nis of no great consequence. \"Dead\" books are not affected by the length\r\nof the term of copyright. In the case also of popular new books, the\r\ngreat sales and consequent disproportionate remuneration comes within a\r\nshort period of time after publication, and are not likely to continue\r\nduring a long term of copyright. On the other hand, many books of great\r\nand permanent value not unfrequently make their way slowly into popular\r\nfavor, and are not fully appreciated until many years after publication.\r\nFor such books--the results, perhaps, of long years of study and\r\nlabor--an equitable return cannot be secured except by a long term of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most urgently desirable forward step in respect to copyright\r\nis the adhesion of the United States to the Berne convention, thus\r\nsecuring the inclusion in the International Copyright Union of our\r\ncountry, the leading one of the three great states not yet members of\r\nthis admirable association of nations. Were the United States a member\r\nof the Berne Union a compliance with the statutory provisions of our own\r\nlaws alone would secure copyright protection not only within the limits\r\nof the United States, but practically throughout the whole book-reading\r\nworld--Great Britain, all Europe (except temporarily Russia, Austria,\r\nand Scandinavia), Canada and Australia, India, Japan and South\r\nAfrica--thus increasing the possible reading public of American authors\r\nmany fold. It would seem that considerations of justice to our large and\r\nconstantly increasing national contingent of literary and artistic\r\nproducers requires this advance of such great practical importance. It\r\nis the easier of accomplishment because it involves the adoption of no\r\nnew principle, but only the extension of the principle embodied in the\r\nAct of March 3, 1891, namely, reciprocal international exchange of\r\ncopyright privileges, and in return for the advantages which would\r\naccrue to our own citizens, only obligates the extension of copyright in\r\nthe United States to the subjects of such countries as are members of\r\nthe Union. Of the members of the International Copyright Union, all the\r\ngreat nations already enjoy copyright in the United States, and it would\r\nonly remain to extend this privilege to the citizen authors of the six\r\nminor states that are members of the Union, namely, Hayti, Japan,\r\nLuxembourg, Monaco, Norway and Tunis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE RELATIONSHIP OF PUBLISHERS, BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIANS.\r\n\r\n              BY W. MILLARD PALMER, _Grand Rapids, Mich._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accepting the president's suggestion to give \"expression of the\r\n_business_ side of the subject rather than the theoretical or\r\nsentimental,\" I wish at the outset to recall certain functions performed\r\nby publishers, booksellers and librarians, and to acknowledge my\r\nindebtedness to Mr. J. W. Nichols, secretary of the American\r\nBooksellers' Association, for material along this line.\r\n\r\nCasual observers have come to regard publishers as bookmakers or\r\nmanufacturers, who merely put the product of authors into merchantable\r\nform, and distribute it to dealers, for sale to the reading public. If\r\nthis were the only function of the publisher, his task would be an easy\r\none; indeed we might soon expect to see all publishers supplanted by one\r\ngreat co-operative factory, to which authors might take their\r\nmanuscripts, and have them transformed into books and distributed\r\nthrough the ordinary channels of commerce, like any other commodities.\r\nSome superficial observers have recently made bold to conjecture that\r\nthis will be the final outcome of the present troubled state of the\r\ngeneral trade of publishing and selling books. But, alas! the actual\r\nmaking of the book--giving to it an appropriate, artistic and really\r\nattractive form--is perhaps the least of the publishers' trials, though\r\nthis, in itself, is a difficult task, requiring an artistic taste, well\r\ntrained and skilful judgment, and much technical knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo one who has had an insight into the publishing business, the enormous\r\nmass of manuscript that is annually submitted to each of the great\r\npublishers is simply appalling. They are compelled to employ a corps of\r\n\"readers\" to cull out that which is worthy of consideration by an\r\nintelligent and skilled publisher. Much that come to hand has been\r\nhastily prepared by persons who lacked the time, experience or special\r\ntraining necessary to enable an author to prepare an acceptable\r\nmanuscript, while the great majority of young authors have really no\r\nmessage to tell that is worth recording. Here comes the most difficult\r\nand trying task of the successful publisher--_the selection of proper\r\nmaterial for publication_. It often happens that a rejected manuscript\r\ncontains some good work--a promise of something better to come. Then the\r\npublisher points out the best features and encourages the incipient\r\nauthor to try again.\r\n\r\nThus books are made, not after a given pattern, like certain fabrics,\r\nbut each is a creation in itself. The responsibility of the publisher,\r\nfor the character of the creation, is by no means unimportant. He acts\r\nas arbiter of the standard of excellence that must be attained by an\r\nauthor before he is introduced to the public. The publishers' criterion\r\nis simply a question of cash. \"Will the public buy the book and pay for\r\nit?\" Nor can any other standard be adopted with safety. The whole\r\nquestion of supply must always depend upon public demand.\r\n\r\nBut the publisher is not infallible. He often makes mistakes. Between\r\nhim and the readers is the dealer. The retail bookseller stands closest\r\nto the reading public. He acquaints himself with the essential character\r\nof the new book, points out to his customer enough of interest to cause\r\nhim to glance through it, and finally sells it to him; for the\r\nintelligent bookseller knows the taste and reading habits of his\r\ncustomers. He has his leading customers in mind from the time he orders\r\na new book till he has shown it and sold it to them. If they are pleased\r\nwith it, and recommend it to their friends, who call at the store for\r\nit, the bookseller re-orders it, and, if he is so fortunate as not to be\r\nrestrained by unfair local competition, he advertises the book and\r\npushes its sale with energy, so long as interest in it can be kept\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nThus the retail booksellers in every city and hamlet throughout the\r\ncountry, standing close to the reading public, knowing what their\r\ncustomers will buy, are the real monitors of the publishers.\r\n\r\nWhen the publisher considers the advisability of bringing out a new\r\nbook, he cannot undertake to look beyond a few hundred booksellers. It\r\nis through them, and only through them, that he has learned to gauge the\r\ntaste of the reading public. The paramount question for him to decide\r\nis, \"How many copies of this particular book can I sell to dealer A,\r\ndealer B and dealer C; how many copies of this book can I hope with\r\ncertainty to sell to all of my customers in the trade?\" The publisher\r\nwell knows that the dealer is governed by the same criterion as himself:\r\n\"Will it pay; will this book be a ready seller, or will it cost me all\r\nof the profit I make on it to sell it?\"\r\n\r\nThus the product of the author is subject to the immutable laws of\r\nsupply and demand from the time he submits his first immature manuscript\r\nuntil he makes two, three, four or more trials, and finally has a\r\nmanuscript accepted. But even then the publishers prepares only a small\r\nedition for a new author, and the dealers are very conservative in\r\nordering a new book--especially by an unknown author. The conscientious\r\nbookseller awaits the verdict of certain patrons, knowing that, if the\r\nbook is commended by one whose judgment is respected by local readers,\r\nhe can safely re-order a goodly number.\r\n\r\nThus the author is dependent upon the publisher for the standard of\r\nexcellence he must attain in order to achieve success; the publisher is\r\ndependent upon the dealer, not only in forming his judgment of the\r\ncharacter of books that will sell, but also for the number that he may\r\nsafely print; while the dealer is dependent upon his best and most\r\ncritical patrons. Hence the relation of author, publisher and dealer is\r\nso close--indeed they are so mutually interdependent--that one factor\r\ncould not be removed without vitally crippling the other.\r\n\r\nA distinguished librarian, who has been a pioneer of progress in the\r\nlibrary movement, has recently suggested the propriety of abolishing\r\nbook stores (_see Publishers' Weekly_, May 11, '01, p. 1149) and\r\nallowing public librarians to receive orders and forward them to the\r\npublishers. If the distinguished gentleman did not have in view visions\r\nof personal gain for public librarians, he should have carried his\r\nphilanthropic suggestion farther, and proposed to abolish both\r\nbooksellers and librarians, and to allow the public to procure their\r\nbooks directly from the publishers, thus saving that moiety of gain that\r\nwould be made by either in return for the service rendered. It cannot be\r\nsupposed that so able and conscientious an administrative officer ever\r\ncontemplated maintaining an extra corps of assistants, at an extra\r\nexpense to the municipality or to those liberal benefactors who have\r\nendowed public libraries, in order that opulent citizens may still\r\nfurther indulge their tastes by purchasing larger private libraries,\r\nwithout paying the small commission or profit that is usually allowed to\r\nretail booksellers. On the other hand, if this proposal was made for the\r\npurpose of allowing libraries maintained by taxing the municipality, to\r\nengage in gainful occupation, this is carrying the socialistic idea\r\nfarther than even our populistic friends have ever yet proposed.\r\n\r\nHowever, inasmuch as this question has been raised, we are bound to\r\ntreat it from an economic point of view. The question is, \"Shall the\r\nbookseller be abolished and his office merged into that of the\r\nlibrarian, and can the librarian perform the offices of the bookseller?\"\r\n\r\nNo one has ever questioned the value of the public library from the\r\nburning of the Alexandrian Library to the present day. The value of a\r\nlibrary, as a _librarium_, or storehouse for the permanent preservation\r\nof books, has always been manifest.\r\n\r\nAgain, the public library gives a larger opportunity and a wider range\r\nthan is possible in the private collection; and scholars, historians and\r\nstudents of all classes are daily made grateful to the trained,\r\nprofessional librarian, who has so classified the contents of the\r\nlibrary as to make the whole available at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nStill another inestimable feature of the public library is that it\r\nmaintains a public reading room for children as well as adults.\r\n\r\nFinally, the library furnishes reading at home to those who are not yet\r\nin a position to become owners of books. The benefit derived from\r\nreading of this character is often of questionable value. The _habitué_\r\nof the circulating library makes his selections from misleading or\r\nsensational titles. Little care and less intelligence is exercised in\r\nchoosing either title or author. As a result librarians are constantly\r\ncomplaining that only the trashiest and most worthless books are read.\r\n\r\nThe circulating department of the public library is now supplemented by\r\nothers that are conducted for cash profit. These have sprung up in many\r\ncities. And now we have the \"Book-Lovers' Library,\" a corporation with\r\ncapital stock, engaging in business for profit. It has the advantage of\r\ncertain trust features. It proposes to organize branches in all of the\r\nprincipal cities and towns in the country. For five dollars a year it\r\nproposes to supply fifty dollars' worth of reading to each subscriber.\r\nAn automobile is employed, with an attendant to deliver the books to\r\nsubscribers each week and take up those that have been read. Having paid\r\nfive, ten or more dollars, at the beginning of the year, the subscriber\r\ncan read from morning till night, while the new books come and go with\r\nthe lightning speed of the automobile.\r\n\r\nAs in many other circulating libraries, new copyrighted fiction is the\r\nchief staple supplied by the \"Book-Lovers' Library\"--the sweetest\r\npabulum automatically administered.\r\n\r\nAfter a season of such dissipation call in a neurologist to diagnose\r\nyour patient, and he will advise you that by continuing the treatment\r\nthe mind will be reduced to a sieve, if not ultimately to absolute\r\nimbecility. Having abandoned the more serious literature that calls into\r\nuse all the faculties of the mind, the reader of nothing but fiction\r\nconverts what would otherwise be a healthful recreation into\r\ndissipation, that is enervating and permanently debilitating to all the\r\nfaculties of the mind, when carried to an extreme. Had the reader been\r\ndenied the use of this automatic machine, and been compelled, as\r\nformerly, to browse through the book store in search of something to\r\nread, more serious books would have been selected--history, travel,\r\ndescriptive writing or popular science, with an occasional novel by way\r\nof recreation.\r\n\r\nBut to continue the argument, suppose we abolish the bookseller, as has\r\nbeen proposed. This would not be a difficult matter. Most of them would\r\ngladly be \"abolished\" if they could sell out their stock for anything\r\nnear what it cost them. Their profits have been so reduced by unfair\r\ncompetition that they are not sufficient to pay the cost of doing\r\nbusiness. They have been compelled to carry side lines, as stationery,\r\nnewspapers, periodicals, sporting goods, _bric-a-brac_, wall paper,\r\netc., in order to make a living. By this means they have learned that\r\nother lines of merchandise yield a better profit than books. As a result\r\nmost of them have greatly reduced their book stock, or entirely\r\nabandoned the sale of books, and put in more profitable lines of\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nThe causes that have led up to this result are manifold: 1st. They were\r\nstrenuously urged, and they finally consented to allow discounts:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) To ministers of the gospel, since they are public benefactors.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) To school teachers, since they are public educators and\r\n      benefactors.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) To public libraries, since they are for the most part\r\n      eleemosynary institutions, and hence entitled to charity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when I recount the charitable benefactions that have been\r\nexacted and received at the hands of the retail bookseller, he seems to\r\nme to have been the most saintly character that has lived in my day and\r\ngeneration. And right here it is of interest to note that these\r\nministers, these teachers, these physicians, these public librarians\r\nwere actually receiving out of the hands of the public stated salaries\r\nthat exceeded by far the annual net profit of the average bookseller.\r\n\r\n2d. Having secured from the local dealer a discount equal to the best\r\npart of his profit, many librarians have gone behind him and appealed\r\ndirectly to the publishers for a larger discount. This has been granted\r\nin most cases, so that most librarians have recently been receiving as\r\nlarge a discount as local dealers.\r\n\r\n3d. Commission agents have purchased complete editions of\r\npopular-selling books from the publishers, and re-sold them at a slight\r\nadvance:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) To dry-goods stores, where they have been put on \"bargain\r\n      counters\" and sold at less than cost, to attract customers to their\r\n      stores.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) To publishers of local newspapers, who give the books away as\r\n      premiums or sell them at cost prices, to increase the local\r\n      circulation of their papers.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) To mail-order agencies, who advertise the books at less than they\r\n      are usually sold for by dealers.\r\n\r\n4th. Many publishers have been advertising and mailing their books\r\ndirectly to retail customers at reduced prices, or at the same price\r\nthey recommended local dealers to ask for them, and they have prepaid\r\nthe postage, thus _competing directly with their distributing agents,\r\nthe booksellers, in their own field_.\r\n\r\n5th. Finally, some local librarians, who a few years ago were appealing\r\nto local booksellers for a discount, having been granted the discount,\r\nhave recently been supplying books \"at cost prices\" to other patrons of\r\nthe local booksellers. Thus our friends, the librarians, having inverted\r\nthe good old practice of returning good for evil, having helped to rob\r\nthe local bookseller of his livelihood, now propose to abolish his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nTo carry the proposition to its conclusions, suppose we abolish the\r\nbookseller. Can the librarian take his place and send the orders in to\r\nthe publishers? If so, if this is all there is to the bookselling\r\nbusiness, why should the publisher pay a commission to the librarian for\r\ndoing what the people could as readily do for themselves? But a general\r\nbusiness cannot be carried on in this way. Publishers have tried it for\r\nyears, yet only comparatively few people are willing to order books that\r\nthey have not had an opportunity to examine, and of this class\r\nlibrarians are the most conservative. They, too, want to know what they\r\nare buying before they place their orders. Hence, this postulate: If the\r\nlibrarian is to succeed the bookseller, he must become a merchant; he\r\nmust order stocks of books and take the speculative chance of selling\r\nthem. But the librarian has had no experience or training in\r\nmerchandising. Can he afford to hazard his own capital in an untried\r\nfield; can he induce his friends to supply him with capital to invest in\r\na business of which he confessedly has no knowledge? It would manifestly\r\nbe a perversion of the funds of the institution in charge of the\r\nlibrarian, to invest them in a gainful occupation.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said, it must be apparent that booksellers, as well as\r\nlibrarians, have a province of their own, and perform a service that\r\ncannot be delegated to another. And hence it is desirable that we live\r\nand dwell together in peace and amity.\r\n\r\nBut in these days of combinations, reorganizations and revolutions in\r\nthe conduct of business, the publishers have looked farther, in their\r\nquest for more economical purveying agents. For the past ten years they\r\nhave been trying to induce the dry-goods merchants to carry books. But,\r\nafter all this time, not more than half a dozen department stores carry\r\nfairly representative stocks of books. They confine themselves, for the\r\nmost part, to new copyrighted fiction, and of this they handle only that\r\nwhich is widely advertised.\r\n\r\nOf late, department stores and dry-goods stores have met severe\r\ncompetition in clothing stores, that make no pretext of carrying a book\r\nstock. They simply buy an edition of a popular-selling book and\r\nadvertise it for less money than it actually cost. They do this simply\r\nas an advertising dodge, to attract customers to their stores. Then,\r\ntoo, the mail-order agencies have cut the price of the most popular\r\nbooks so low that it is no longer profitable to handle them. The result\r\nof this has been that many of the most promising new novels have been\r\nkilled before they were fairly put on the market; for _as soon as they\r\nceased to be profitable no one could afford to re-order them_.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this recent drift of the trade has been to stimulate the\r\nfrothy side of literature to an extreme degree. The more serious\r\nliterature is being neglected. The latest novel is the fad. Its average\r\nlife is reduced to little more than one year, though the copyright lasts\r\nfor twenty-eight years, and with a renewal it may be extended to\r\nforty-two years.\r\n\r\nThis shortening of the life of books has had a baneful effect:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Baneful to the bookseller, since it frequently leaves him with a\r\n      dead stock of books on hand that cannot be turned without loss.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Baneful to the publisher, since the book stops selling and the\r\n      plates become valueless before he has had time fairly to recoup\r\n      himself for the expense of bringing it out, advertising it, and\r\n      putting it on the market.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Baneful to the author, since by shortening the life of his books\r\n      the value of his property in them is reduced.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most baneful effect of this craze for ephemeral\r\nliterature is upon the people themselves. As the standard or degree of\r\ncivilization for a given age is marked by the character of the\r\nliterature the people produce and read, we cannot hope for a golden age\r\nin American letters, unless the present system is reversed. Work of real\r\nmerit is never done by accident, nor is it the product of mediocre\r\ntalents. If we are to develop a national literature that shall fitly\r\ncharacterize the sterling qualities of the American people in this, the\r\nfull strength of the early manhood of the nation; at the time when the\r\nnation has taken its place in the vanguard of civilization; at the time\r\nwhen the consumptive power of the nation is equal to one-third of that\r\nof the entire civilized world; at the time when men of talents and\r\ngenius are annually earning and expending, for their comfort and\r\npleasure, more munificent sums than were ever lavished on the most\r\nopulent princes; I say, if we are to produce a literature that shall\r\nfitly characterize this age of our nation, we must hold forth such\r\nrewards for the pursuits of literature as will attract men of genius,\r\nmen of the most lustrous talents, men who are the peers of their\r\nco-workers in other walks of life. But this will not be possible so long\r\nas the present strife to furnish cheap literature to the people\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the bookseller has not suffered alone in this\r\ncheapening process. The publisher has suffered. Within the past few\r\nmonths two names that for half a century were household words, synonyms\r\nof all that is excellent in the publishing world, have met with\r\ndisaster, and others were approaching a crisis.\r\n\r\nFortunately one firm stood out so prominently, as a bulwark of financial\r\nstrength and security, that its president, Mr. Charles Scribner, of\r\nCharles Scribner's Sons, could afford to take the initiative in calling\r\nfor reform. He invited the co-operation of other publishers, and a year\r\nago this month they met in New York and organized the American\r\nPublishers' Association. Their organization now includes practically all\r\nof the general publishers who contribute anything of real value to\r\ncurrent literature.\r\n\r\nThe publishers canvassed thoroughly the causes that had led to the\r\ndecline of the trade, and they appointed a committee to draft reform\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the decline of the trade, two facts stood out so\r\nprominently that it was impossible to disassociate them as cause and\r\neffect. The three thousand booksellers, upon whom, as purveying agents,\r\nthe publishers had depended a generation ago, had shrunk in number until\r\nonly about five hundred could be counted who were worthy to be called\r\nbooksellers. The other fact, which doubtless made quite as deep an\r\nimpression upon the minds of the publishers, was that the long line of\r\nbooks, on each of their published catalogs, was practically dead. Those\r\nbooks of high standard character, by eminent authors, books that for\r\nyears had had a good annual sale, no longer moved. These standard books\r\nhave been a large source of revenue to publishers and their authors for\r\nmany years. But now so few of them are sold that it hardly pays the\r\npublishers to send their travellers over the road.\r\n\r\nFew dry-goods merchants, druggists, newsdealers and stationers, that\r\nhave recently been induced to carry a small number of books, feel\r\nsufficiently well acquainted with salable literature to warrant their\r\ncarrying anything more than the most popular-selling new copyrighted\r\nnovels and cheap reprints of non-copyrighted books that sell for\r\ntwenty-five cents or less. As stated above, there are a few large\r\ndepartment stores that carry a more general stock, but they are so few\r\nthat the support received from them is not sufficient to compensate, in\r\nany measure, the loss sustained through the sacrifice of the regular\r\nbooksellers. Moreover, the regular booksellers that still remain in the\r\nbusiness have not been buying many standard books of late. Seeing their\r\nprofit in fiction sacrificed by unfair competition, many of them have\r\nordered only enough of the new copyrighted novels to keep alive their\r\naccumulated stocks of standard books, until they can sell them out or\r\nreduce them to a point where they can afford to abandon the book\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFrom the character of the reform measures adopted by the American\r\nPublishers' Association, which went into effect on the first of May, it\r\nis evident that the publishers have determined to restore the old-time\r\nbookseller. This can be done only by the publishers enforcing the\r\nmaintenance of retail prices, the same as is done by the proprietors of\r\nthe Earl & Wilson collar, the Waterman fountain pen, the Eastman kodak,\r\nand many other special lines of which the retail price is listed.\r\n\r\nWhen dry-goods stores and clothing stores bought these special lines and\r\nretailed them at or below the cost price, in _contrast to the list\r\nprice_ asked in the special furnishing stores, in order to attract\r\ncustomers to their stores because of their wonderful \"bargain counters,\"\r\nthe manufacturers realized that the dry-goods stores were simply using\r\nup these wares to advertise their other business. They cut off the\r\nsupply of their goods to these price-cutting dry-goods stores, and\r\nrefused to supply any more goods, except under a substantial undertaking\r\non the part of the dry-goods stores to maintain the full list price.\r\n\r\nThis, in a word, is the substance of the publishers' plan. They have\r\nagreed to cut off absolutely the supply of all of their books, net,\r\ncopyrighted and otherwise, to any dealer who cuts the retail price of a\r\nbook published under the net-price system.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the nearly eight hundred members of the American\r\nBooksellers' Association have entered into a mutual agreement to push\r\nwith energy the sale of the books of all publishers who co-operate with\r\nthem for the maintenance of retail prices, and not to buy, nor put in\r\nstock, nor offer for sale, the books of any publisher who fails to\r\nco-operate with them. This is substantially the same system that was\r\nadopted in Germany in 1887, in France a few years later, and in England\r\nin 1900.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this system in Germany has been to lift up the trade from\r\na condition even more deplorable, if possible, than that into which it\r\nhas fallen in this country, and to make it a prosperous and profitable\r\nbusiness. It has proved beneficent and satisfactory, not only to dealers\r\nand publishers, but also to authors and to the reading public, for every\r\ncity, town and village in Germany now sustains a book shop that carries\r\na fairly representative stock of books, so that the people are able to\r\nexamine promptly every book as soon as it comes from the press, and the\r\nauthors are sure of having their books promptly submitted to the\r\nexamination of every possible purchaser.\r\n\r\nThe results in France and England are equally encouraging, and it is\r\nbelieved that as soon as the American system is fully understood, and as\r\nsoon as enough books are included under the net-price system, so that a\r\nbookseller can once more make a living on the sale of books, many of the\r\nold-time booksellers will again put in a stock of books and help to\r\nre-establish the book trade in America.\r\n\r\nHaving tried to define the present relation of publishers and\r\nbooksellers, I beg leave to say frankly that I know of no reason why\r\npublishers and booksellers should maintain any different relations with\r\nlibrarians than they maintain with any other retail customers.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us take the new \"Book-Lovers' Library,\" so called.\r\nTheir plan is to sell memberships, and to deliver to each member one\r\nbook a week for five dollars a year, or three books a week for ten\r\ndollars a year. They take up the books at the end of each week and\r\nsupply new ones.\r\n\r\nIf this plan could be carried out successfully, it would result in\r\nmaking one book do the service now performed by ten or fifteen books. In\r\nother words, this circulating library proposes to furnish its members\r\nwith ten or fifteen books for the same amount of money they now pay for\r\none book by simply passing the book around from one to another.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this scheme, if carried into all cities and towns as\r\nproposed, would be to reduce the number of books manufactured and sold\r\nto about _one-tenth_ of its present magnitude. From a business point of\r\nview, publishers and dealers cannot be called upon to make special\r\ndiscounts to encourage such an enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement and support given to authors, by patrons of\r\nliterature, would be reduced by this scheme to about one-tenth of the\r\npresent amount. The effect of this withdrawal of support to American\r\nauthors can easily be imagined.\r\n\r\nBut I do not believe that real book-lovers, intelligent and conservative\r\nreaders, will be carried away by this passing craze. On the contrary,\r\nthey have studiously avoided forming that careless, slip-shod habit of\r\nreading that characterizes patrons of circulating libraries. The real\r\nbook-lover selects his books like his friends, with caution, and with\r\ndiscriminating and painstaking care.\r\n\r\nFrom a bookseller's point of view, the \"Book-Lovers' Library\" is not\r\nfounded on practical lines. However, as the plan also includes the\r\nselling of capital stocks to its patrons, it is probable that the money\r\nreceived from subscriptions, together with the annual membership fees,\r\nwill be sufficient to keep the enterprise going for some time. But since\r\nthis is a corporation organized for the purpose of making money, a\r\nfailure to earn money and to pay dividends will discourage its patrons,\r\ncause them to feel that they have been deceived, and finally to withdraw\r\nfrom membership. When the members realize that they are paying five or\r\nten dollars a year for privileges that can be had free at the local\r\nlibrary, in most cases they will withdraw their support.\r\n\r\nThus, while in some respects I regard this enterprise as an evil factor,\r\nit contains, I think, inherent weaknesses that will finally compass its\r\nown end.\r\n\r\nBut what is said of the relation of publishers and dealers to the\r\nBook-Lovers' Library is true in a measure of all circulating and other\r\npublic libraries. They do not increase, but they positively contract the\r\nnumber of sales that are made in the interest of authors, publishers and\r\ndealers.\r\n\r\nUnder the German system, of which I have spoken, public libraries were\r\nat first allowed ten per cent. discount; but recently this has been\r\nreduced to five per cent.\r\n\r\nUnder the English system, profiting by the experience of German\r\npublishers, no discount is allowed to public libraries, schools or\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe American system, however, is modelled largely after the German, and\r\nit permits the dealers to allow a discount of ten per cent. to local\r\nlibraries. In doing this local dealers are protected from competition by\r\nthe publishers, in that the publishers have agreed to add to the net\r\nprice the cost of transportation on all books sold at retail outside of\r\nthe cities in which they are doing business. Thus public libraries can\r\nbuy net books cheaper of the local booksellers than they can buy them of\r\nthe publishers by just the cost of transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LIBRARY BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n       BY W. R. EASTMAN, _New York State Library, Albany, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nA building is not the first requisite of a public library. A good\r\ncollection of books with a capable librarian will be of great service in\r\na hired room or in one corner of a store. First the librarian, then the\r\nbooks and after that the building.\r\n\r\nBut when the building is occupied the value of the library is doubled.\r\nThe item of rent is dropped. The library is no longer dependent on the\r\nfavor of some other institution and is not cramped by the effort to\r\ninclude two or three departments in a single room. It will not only give\r\nfar better service to the community, but will command their respect,\r\ninterest and support to a greater degree than before.\r\n\r\nThe following hints are intended as a reply to many library boards who\r\nare asking for building plans.\r\n\r\nThe vital point in successful building is to group all the parts of a\r\nmodern library in their true relations. To understand a particular case\r\nit will be necessary to ask some preliminary questions.\r\n\r\n  1. _Books._\r\n    Number of volumes in library?\r\n    Average yearly increase?\r\n    Number of volumes in 20 years?\r\n    Number of volumes to go in reference room?\r\n    Number of volumes to go in children's room?\r\n    Number of volumes to go in other departments?\r\n    Number of volumes to go in main book room?\r\n    If the library is large will there be an open shelf room separate from\r\n      the main book room?\r\n    Is a stack needed?\r\n    Will public access to the shelves be allowed?\r\n\r\nBy answers to such questions a fair idea of the character and size of\r\nthe book room may be obtained.\r\n\r\n_Rules for calculation._ In a popular library, outside the reference\r\nroom, for each foot of wall space available 80 books can be placed on\r\neight shelves. Floor cases having two sides will hold 160 books for each\r\nrunning foot, and in a close stack 25 books, approximately, can be\r\nshelved for each square foot of floor space. But the latter rule will be\r\nmaterially modified by ledges, varying width of passages, stairs, etc.\r\n\r\nThe above figures give full capacity. In practical work, to provide for\r\nconvenient classification, expansion, oversized books and working\r\nfacilities, the shelves of a library should be sufficient for twice the\r\nactual number of books and the lines of future enlargement should be\r\nfully determined.\r\n\r\n  2. _Departments._\r\n    Is the library for free circulation?\r\n    Is the library for free reference?\r\n    Are special rooms needed for\r\n      high school students?\r\n      children?\r\n      ladies?\r\n      magazine readers?\r\n      newspaper readers?\r\n    How many square feet for each of the above rooms?\r\n    Are class rooms needed as in a college library?\r\n      Club rooms?\r\n      Lecture rooms?\r\n      Museum?\r\n      Art gallery?\r\n      Other departments?\r\n\r\n  3. _Community._\r\n    In city or country?\r\n    Population?\r\n    By what class will library be chiefly used?\r\n      School children?\r\n      Students?\r\n      Mechanics?\r\n      Reading circles?\r\n      Ladies?\r\n\r\n  4. _Resources and conditions._\r\n    Money available?\r\n    Money annually for maintenance?\r\n    Size of building lot?\r\n    Location and surroundings?\r\n    How many stories?\r\n    Elevators?\r\n    Heat?\r\n    Light?\r\n    Ventilation?\r\n\r\n  5. _Administration._\r\n    Is library to be in charge of one person?\r\n    How many assistants?\r\n    Is a work room needed?\r\n      unpacking room?\r\n      bindery?\r\n      librarian's office?\r\n      trustees' room?\r\n\r\nBy careful study of these points a clear conception of the problem is\r\ngained and the building committee is prepared to draw an outline sketch\r\nindicating in a general way their needs and views. They are not likely\r\nto secure what they want by copying or even by competition. The best\r\narchitects have not the time nor the disposition to compete with each\r\nother. A better way is to choose an architect, one who has succeeded in\r\nlibrary work if possible, who will faithfully study the special\r\nproblems, consult freely with the library board, propose plans and\r\nchange them freely till they are right. And if such plans are also\r\nsubmitted for revision to some librarian of experience or to the library\r\ncommission of the state, whose business and pleasure it is to give\r\ndisinterested advice, so much the better.\r\n\r\nThe following outlines taken from actual library buildings are offered\r\nby way of suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Square plan._\r\n\r\nAn inexpensive building for a small country neighborhood may have one\r\nsquare room with book shelves on the side and rear walls. A convenient\r\nentrance is from a square porch on one side of the front corner and a\r\nlibrarian's alcove is at the opposite corner leaving the entire front\r\nlike a store window which may be filled with plants or picture\r\nbulletins. With a stone foundation the wooden frame may be finished with\r\nstained shingles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Oblong plan._\r\n\r\nA somewhat larger building may have a wider front with entrance at the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nBook shelves under high windows may cover the side and rear walls and\r\ntables may stand in the open space.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to bring together the books most in demand for\r\ncirculation on one side of the room and those needed most for study on\r\nthe opposite side. One corner may contain juvenile books. In this way\r\nconfusion between readers, borrowers and children will be avoided. Each\r\nclass of patrons will go by a direct line to its own quarter. This is\r\nthe beginning of the plan of departments which will be of great\r\nimportance in the larger building.\r\n\r\nThe number of books for circulation will increase rapidly and it may\r\nsoon be necessary to provide double faced floor cases. These will be\r\nplaced with passages running from the center of the room towards the end\r\nand that end will become the book or delivery room and the opposite side\r\nwill be the study or reference room.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _T-shape plan._\r\n\r\nThe next step is to add space to the rear giving a third department to\r\nthe still open room. If the book room is at the back the student readers\r\nmay be at tables in the right hand space and the children in the space\r\non the left. The librarian at a desk in the center is equally near to\r\nall departments and may exercise full supervision.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a considerable number of other busy persons has a\r\nsobering and quieting effect on all and the impression of such a library\r\nhaving all its departments in one is dignified and wholesome. It may be\r\nwell to separate the departments by light open hand rails, screens,\r\ncords or low book cases. It is a mistake to divide a small building into\r\nthree or four small rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Separate rooms._\r\n\r\nFor a larger library these rails must be made into partitions, giving to\r\neach department a separate room. Partitions of glass set in wooden\r\nframes and possibly only eight feet high may answer an excellent\r\npurpose, adding to the impression of extent, admitting light to the\r\ninterior of the building and allowing some supervision from the center.\r\nWith partitions on each side, the entrance becomes a central hallway\r\nwith a department at each side and the book room at the end. This is\r\nthe best position for the book room for two special reasons. Overlapping\r\nthe departments in both wings it is equally accessible from either, and\r\nat the back of the house a plainer and cheaper wall can be built\r\nadmitting of easy removal when the growth of the library requires\r\nenlargement.\r\n\r\nSometimes the angles between the book room and the main building may be\r\nfilled to advantage by work room and office. These working rooms though\r\nnot large and not conspicuous are of vital consequence and should be\r\ncarefully planned.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a type of building which, for lack of a better word,\r\nI may call the \"butterfly plan,\" having two spread wings and a body\r\nextending to the back. Others call it the \"trefoil.\" This general type\r\nis being substantially followed in most new libraries of moderate size.\r\nFrom one entrance hall direct access is given to three distinct\r\ndepartments, or perhaps to five, by placing two rooms in each wing.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Modifications required by limited space._\r\n\r\nIf we have an open park to build in we shall be tempted to expand the\r\nhallway to a great central court or rotunda. Perhaps the importance of\r\nthe library may justify it, but we should be on our guard against\r\nseparating departments by spaces so great as to make supervision\r\ndifficult or passing from one to another inconvenient. We should aim to\r\nconcentrate rather than scatter.\r\n\r\nMore frequently the lot will be too narrow. We must draw in the wings\r\nand make the narrower rooms longer from front to back. With a corner lot\r\nwe can enter on the side street, leaving a grand reading room on the\r\nmain front and turning at right angles as we enter the house pass\r\nbetween other rooms to the book room at the extreme end of the lot. Or\r\nagain, we shall be obliged to dispense entirely with one wing of our\r\nplan, and have but two department rooms instead of three on the floor.\r\nEvery location must be studied by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Other stories._\r\n\r\nBasement rooms are of great service for work rooms and storage. A\r\nbasement directly under the main book room is specially valuable to\r\nreceive the overflow of books not in great demand.\r\n\r\nA second and even a third story will be useful for special collections,\r\nclass and lecture rooms or a large audience hall. In a library of\r\nmoderate size it will often be found convenient to build a book room\r\nabout 16 feet high to cover two stories of bookcases and wholly\r\nindependent of the level of the second floor of the main building.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Extension._\r\n\r\nTo meet the needs of a rapidly growing library it is important at the\r\nbeginning to fix the lines of extension.\r\n\r\nA building with a front of two rooms and a passage between may add a\r\nthird room at the rear, and at a later stage, add a second building as\r\nlarge as the first and parallel to it, the two being connected by the\r\nroom first added.\r\n\r\nThis is the architect's plan for the Omaha Public Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Open court._\r\n\r\nWhen a library is so large that one book room is not enough, two such\r\nrooms may be built to the rear, one from each end of the building with\r\nopen space between, and these two wings may be carried back equally and\r\njoined at the back by another building, thus completing the square\r\naround an open court.\r\n\r\nThis gives wide interior space for light and air, or grass and flowers.\r\nSuch is the plan of the Boston Public and Princeton University\r\nlibraries. It will be the same in Minneapolis when that library is\r\ncomplete. In the plan of the new library at Newark, N. J., the central\r\ncourt is roofed over with glass becoming a stairway court with\r\nsurrounding galleries opening on all rooms. In Columbia University, New\r\nYork, as in the British Museum, the center is a great reading room\r\ncapped by a dome high above the surrounding roofs and lighted by great\r\nclerestory windows.\r\n\r\nIf the street front is very long there may be three extensions to the\r\nrear, one opposite the center and one from each end, leaving two open\r\ncourts as in the plan for the New York Public or the Utica Public; and\r\nthis general scheme may be repeated and carried still farther back\r\nleaving four open courts as in the Library of Congress. This plan can\r\nbe extended as far as space can be provided.\r\n\r\nWhen the general plan of the large building is fixed, passages will be\r\nintroduced, parallel to the front and sides, and departments will be\r\nlocated as may be judged most convenient, always having regard to the\r\nconvenience of the patrons of each department in finding ready access to\r\nthe books they need and providing for supervision and attendance at\r\nleast cost of time, effort and money. Extravagance in library building\r\nis not so often found in lavish ornament as in that unfortunate\r\narrangement of departments which requires three attendants to do the\r\nwork of one or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Light._\r\n\r\nNatural light should be secured if possible for every room. Windows\r\nshould be frequent and extend well up toward the ceiling terminating in\r\na straight line so as to afford large supply of light from the top.\r\nWindows like those in an ordinary house or office building, coming\r\nwithin two or three feet of the floor are more satisfactory both for\r\ninside and outside appearance than those which leave a high blank wall\r\nbeneath them. From the street a blank wall has a prison-like effect; on\r\nthe inside it cuts off communication with the rest of the world and the\r\nimpression is unpleasant. The proper object of library windows six or\r\neight feet above the floor is to allow unbroken wall space for book\r\nshelves beneath them. There is no serious objection to this at the back\r\nof the room or sometimes at the sides of the house where the windows are\r\nnot conspicuous from the street, but every room of any size, if it is\r\nnext to the outer wall, should have windows to look out of on at least\r\none side.\r\n\r\nA book room at the back of a building may secure excellent light from\r\nside windows eight feet above the floor with lower windows at the back.\r\n\r\nThe lighting of large interior rooms is often a difficult problem. Light\r\nwill not penetrate to advantage more than 30 feet. Skylights, domes and\r\nclerestory windows are used. In the case of the dome or clerestory the\r\nroom to be lighted must be higher than those immediately surrounding it.\r\nThe clerestory plan with upright windows is most satisfactory when\r\navailable, being cheaper and giving better security against the weather\r\nthan the skylight. In a large building with interior courts, the lower\r\nstory of the court is sometimes covered with a skylight and used as a\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThis appears in the plans for the New York Public and the Utica Public\r\nlibraries. Skylights must be constructed with special care to protect\r\nrooms against the weather.\r\n\r\nThe problem of light is peculiarly difficult in the crowded blocks of\r\ncities. A library front may sometimes touch the walls of adjoining\r\nbuildings so that light can enter only from the front and rear. If\r\nextending more than 40 feet back from the street, it will be necessary\r\nto narrow the rest of the building so as to leave open spaces on each\r\nside, or to introduce a little light by the device of light wells.\r\nOccasionally a large city library is found on the upper floors of an\r\noffice building, where light and air are better than below, and the cost\r\nof accommodation is less. The use of elevators makes this feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Shelving._\r\n\r\nThe general scheme of book shelves should be fixed before the plan of\r\nthe building is drawn. Otherwise the space for books can not be\r\ndetermined and serious mistakes may be made. Between the two extremes of\r\nopen wall shelves and the close stack a compromise is necessary. The\r\nlarge library will put the bulk of its books in a stack and bring a\r\nconsiderable selection of the best books into an open room. The small\r\nlibrary will begin with books along the walls and provide cases for\r\nadditions from time to time as needed. Its patrons will enjoy at first\r\nthe generous spaces of the open room without an array of empty cases to\r\noffend the eye and cumber the floor. When walls are covered with books a\r\nfloor case will be introduced and others when needed will be placed\r\naccording to plan, till at last the floor is as full as it was meant to\r\nbe, and the basement beneath having served for a time to hold the\r\noverflow, a second story of cases is put on the top of the first. This\r\nprocess should be planned in advance for a term of 20 years.\r\n\r\nFor public access passages between cases should be five feet wide. Cases\r\nhave sometimes been set on radial lines so as to bring all parts under\r\nsupervision from the center. This arrangement, specially if bounded by a\r\nsemi-circular wall, is expensive, wasteful of space and of doubtful\r\nvalue, except in peculiar conditions. It is not adapted to further\r\nextension of the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Size of shelf._\r\n\r\nFor ordinary books in a popular library the shelf should not be more\r\nthan eight inches wide with an upright space of ten inches. Eight\r\nshelves of this height with a base of four inches and crown finish of\r\nfive inches will fill eight feet from the floor and the upper shelf may\r\nbe reached at a height of 81 inches or six feet nine inches. Ordinary\r\nshelves should not exceed three feet in length. A length of two and a\r\nhalf feet is preferred by many. A shelf more than three feet long is apt\r\nto bend under the weight of books. For books of larger size a limited\r\nnumber of shelves with 12 inches upright space and a few still larger\r\nshould be provided. The proportion of oversize books will vary greatly\r\naccording to the kind of library, a college or scientific collection\r\nhaving many more than the circulating library. Any reference room will\r\ncontain a large number of such books and its shelves should correspond.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Movable shelves._\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been given to devices for adjustment of shelves. Some\r\nof these are quite ingenious and a few are satisfactory. No device\r\nshould be introduced that will seriously break the smooth surface at the\r\nside. Notches, cross bars, iron horns or hooks or ornamental brackets\r\nexpose the last book to damage. If pins are used they should be so held\r\nto their places that they cannot fall out. Heads of pins or bars should\r\nbe sunk in the wood and the place for books left, as near as possible,\r\nabsolutely smooth on all sides. It is at least a question whether the\r\nimportance of making shelves adjustable and absolutely adjustable has\r\nnot been greatly overrated. As a fact the shelves of the circulating\r\nlibrary are very seldom adjusted. They may have all the usual appliances\r\ngained at large expense but there is no occasion to adjust them outside\r\nthe reference room. They remain as they were put up. It is probably well\r\nto have the second and third shelf movable so that one can be dropped to\r\nthe bottom and two spaces left where there were three at first. But all\r\nother shelves might as well be fixed at intervals of 10 inches without\r\nthe least real inconvenience and the cases be stronger for it and far\r\ncheaper. A perfectly adjustable shelf is interesting as a study in\r\nmechanics, but is practically disappointing. Its very perfection is a\r\nsnare because it is so impossible to set it true without a spirit level\r\nand a machinist. All shelves in a reference room should be adjustable.\r\nBound magazines might have special cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Wood or iron shelves._\r\n\r\nIron shelf construction has the advantage of lightness and strength,\r\nfilling the least space and admitting light and air. Where three or more\r\nstories of cases are stacked one upon another iron is a necessity. It\r\nalso offers the best facilities for adjustment of shelves and is most\r\ndurable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it is more difficult to get, can be had only of the\r\nmanufacturers in fixed patterns, and costs at least twice as much as any\r\nwood, even oak, unless carved for ornament, and four or five times as\r\nmuch as some very good wooden shelves. This great cost raises the\r\nquestion whether the advantages named are really important. Few village\r\nlibraries need more than two stories of shelves in a stack. If iron is\r\nmore durable we can buy two sets of wooden shelves for the cost of one\r\nof iron--and when we buy the second set will know better what we want.\r\nThe importance of shelf adjustment has been exaggerated.\r\n\r\nA more important consideration, to my mind, is that iron is not so well\r\nadapted to the changing conditions of a growing library. It is made at a\r\nfactory and to be ordered complete. It is bolted to the floor and wall\r\nat fixed intervals. But we have seen that a gradual accumulation of\r\nbookcases is better than to put all shelving in position at first.\r\n\r\nWooden cases are movable. You begin with those you need and add others\r\nas you have more books, you can change and alter them at any time with\r\nonly the aid of the village carpenter, and enjoy the wide open spaces\r\ntill the time for filling them comes.\r\n\r\nIron with all its ornaments belongs in the shop. It is not the furniture\r\nyou prefer in your home. The item of cost will usually decide the\r\nquestion. For libraries of less than 30,000 volumes, where close storage\r\nis not imperative, wood has the advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Miscellaneous notes._\r\n\r\nA floor of hard wood is good enough for most libraries. Wood covered\r\nwith corticene or linoleum tends to insure the needed quiet. Floors of\r\ntile, marble or concrete are very noisy and should have strips of carpet\r\nlaid in the passages.\r\n\r\nOn the walls of reading rooms it is neither necessary nor desirable to\r\nhave an ornamental wainscot, nor indeed any wainscot at all, not even a\r\nbase board. Book cases will cover the lower walls and books are the best\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nSmall tables for four are preferred in a reading room to long common\r\ntables. They give the reader an agreeable feeling of privacy.\r\n\r\nDo not make tables too high. 30 inches are enough.\r\n\r\nLight bent wood chairs are easy to handle.\r\n\r\nSteam or hot water give the best heat and incandescent electric lamps\r\ngive the best light.\r\n\r\nBe sure that you have sufficient ventilation.\r\n\r\nWindows should be made to slide up and down, not to swing on hinges or\r\npivots.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling further on details let us be sure 1, That we have room\r\nwithin the walls for all the books we now have or are likely to have in\r\n20 years; provide the first outfit of shelves for twice the number of\r\nbooks expected at the end of one year and add bookcases as we need them,\r\nleaving always a liberal margin of empty space on every shelf. We must\r\nplan for the location of additional cases for 20 years with due\r\nconsideration of the question of public access.\r\n\r\n2, That all needed departments are provided in harmonious relation with\r\neach other and so located as to serve the public to the best advantage\r\nand at least cost of time, strength and money.\r\n\r\n3, That the best use of the location is made and the building suited to\r\nthe constituency and local conditions.\r\n\r\n4, That the estimated cost is well within the limit named, for new\r\nobjects of expense are certain to appear during the process of building\r\nand debt must not be thought of.\r\n\r\n5, That the building is convenient for work and supervision, a point at\r\nwhich many an elegant and costly building has conspicuously failed.\r\n\r\nMake it also neat and beautiful, for it is to be the abiding place of\r\nall that is best in human thought and experience and is to be a home in\r\nwhich all inquiring souls are to be welcomed. Since the people are to be\r\nour guests let us make the place of their reception worthy of its\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE RELATION OF THE ARCHITECT TO THE LIBRARIAN.\r\n\r\n          BY JOHN LAWRENCE MAURAN, _Architect, St. Louis, Mo._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public library, as we understand the name to-day, has had but a\r\nbrief existence compared with the mere housing of collections of books\r\nwhich has gone on through countless ages.\r\n\r\nWith the change from the old ideas of safeguarding the precious books\r\nthemselves to the advanced theory of placing their priceless contents\r\nwithin the easy reach of all, has come an equally important change in\r\nthe character of the custodian of the books. The duties of the modern\r\nlibrarian are such that he must be not only something of a scholar, in\r\nthe best sense of the word, but he must be capable also of properly\r\ndirecting others in the pursuit of learning, and, withal, combine\r\nexecutive ability with a highly specialized professional facility. The\r\nresult of carefully conceived courses of training is apparent in the\r\nwonderful results achieved through the devoted and untiring efforts of\r\nthe members of this Association towards a constant betterment of their\r\ncharges, and a closer bonding, through affection, between the masses of\r\nthe people and that portion of the books which lies between the covers.\r\n\r\nMy purpose in recalling to your memory the wonderful advance made by\r\ntraining in your profession in a comparatively short time, is to give\r\npoint to an analogy I wish to draw, showing a corresponding advance in\r\nthe profession of architecture. Not so very many years ago there were\r\nample grounds for the recalling by Mr. David P. Todd of Lord Bacon's\r\nwarning against the sacrifice of utility to mere artistic composition in\r\nthe following words: \"Houses are built to Live in, and not to Looke on:\r\nTherefore let Use bee preferred before Uniformitie; Except where both\r\nmay be had Leave the Goodly Fabrickes of Houses, for Beautie only, to\r\nthe Enchanted Pallaces of the Poets; Who build them with small Cost\":\r\nbut to-day, thanks to the munificence of the French government and the\r\nuntiring energy of some of those who have profited by it, in fostering\r\nthe growth of our own architectural schools, there are few sections of\r\nthis broad land which have not one or more worthy followers of Palladio\r\nand Michael Angelo. Hunt, Richardson and Post were among the first to\r\nreceive the training of the Ecole des Beaux Arts, and they, moreover,\r\nhad the rare judgment to take the training only, adapting their designs\r\nto the climatic and other local conditions rather than attempting the\r\nimportation of French forms as well as method of design. Their example\r\nand the impetus they were able to impart to the technical schools have\r\nbeen potent factors in the development of the talent of American\r\narchitects. While it is true, and more the pity, that some students\r\nreturn from Paris with the idea that because Paris is a beautiful city\r\narchitecturally, the simple injection of some of their own masterpieces\r\ninto our diverse city street fronts, is going to reincarnate our\r\nmunicipalities, the major portion are sufficiently discriminating to\r\nrealize that Paris owes much of its charm to a symmetry under\r\ngovernmental control which we, free born Americans, can never hope to\r\nattain, and leave behind them the mere forms and symbols of their alma\r\nmater to use that which is best and most profitable in their training;\r\nthat is, a breadth of conception of the problem and a logical method of\r\nsequential study of it which ensures a creditable if not an ideal\r\nsolution. The modern architect, to be successful, must be conversant\r\nwith a vast amount of information which is apparently outside his chosen\r\nprofession--such as the minutiae of hospitals, churches, libraries,\r\nrailroad stations and the like. As a case in point I recall the address\r\nof a certain railroad president at the dedication of a large terminal\r\ndepot, in which he said: \"while we have had the co-operation of\r\nengineers and specialists in every branch of the work, I must give great\r\ncredit to our architect who is responsible for the conception of the\r\nentire system of the handling of passengers, although he was employed\r\nsolely to enclose the space designated by our engineers.\" It is not my\r\npurpose to laud the profession of architecture, but rather to show its\r\npreparedness to _co-operate_ with you in achieving the best in library\r\nconstruction and design.\r\n\r\nMay I add to Mr. Todd's advice to library boards about to build, \"first\r\nappoint your librarian,\" the suggestion that second, in consultation\r\nwith him, _appoint_ your architect. It is not disbelief in competition\r\nwhich has led the American Institute of Architects to advise against\r\ncompetitions, for the former is a constant condition, while the latter\r\nthey believe to result in more evil than good. It is a popular notion\r\namong laymen that a competition will bring out _ideas_ and mayhap\r\ndevelop some hidden genius, but in answer to the first I can say, I know\r\nof but one building erected from successful competitive plans without\r\nmodification, and for the second, the major portion of American\r\noriginality in building designs is unworthy the name of architecture.\r\nAside from the needless expense and loss of time entailed on library\r\nboard, as well as architect, by the holding of competitions a greater\r\nevil lies in the well proven fact, that in their desire to win approval\r\nfor their design, most architects endeavor to find out the librarian's\r\npredilections and follow them in their plans rather than to submit a\r\nscholarly solution of the problem studied from an unprejudiced\r\nstandpoint. It is not often the good fortune of competitors to have\r\ntheir submitted work judged with such unbiased intelligence as that\r\nwhich permitted the best conceived plan to win in the competition for\r\nthe new library in New York City. Few men would have dared in\r\ncompetition to remove that imposing architectural feature, the reading\r\nroom, from their main façade and put it frankly where it belongs, in\r\ndirect touch with the stacks which serve it, as Carrere & Hastings did.\r\n\r\nNot long ago a member of a certain library board of trustees wrote to us\r\nthat we were being considered, among others, as architects for their new\r\nbuilding, and he suggested that we send to them as many water colors as\r\nwe could collect and _as large as possible_, to impress the board; for,\r\nas he added, \"some of us appreciate your plans, but most laymen are\r\ncaught by the colored pictures, the larger the better.\"\r\n\r\nAs a rule librarians have very decided ideas as to the plan desired in\r\nso far as it relates to the correlation of rooms and departments, and\r\nit, therefore, seems manifestly proper that having selected a librarian\r\non account of merit, the next step should be the selection of an\r\narchitect on the same basis, to the end that in consultation the theory\r\nof the one may either be studied into shape or proved inferior to the\r\ntheory of the other. Under the discussion of two broad minds, the wheat\r\nis easily separated from the chaff with the much to be desired result of\r\nthe assemblying of a well ordered plan to present to the board, which\r\nhas had such study that few criticisms cannot be answered from the store\r\nof experience gathered in the making. This ideal crystallization of\r\nideas, this development of the problem working hand in hand precludes\r\nthe need of such advice as is found in the following quotation from a\r\npaper on library buildings:\r\n\r\n\"Taking into account the practical uses of the modern library it is\r\nreadily seen that it needs a building planned from inside, not from\r\nwithout, dictated by convenience and not by taste no matter how good.\r\nThe order should be to require the architect to put a presentable\r\nexterior on an interior having only use in view and not as is so often\r\ndone to require the librarian to make the best he can of an interior\r\nimposed by the exigencies of the architect's taste or the demand of the\r\nbuilding committee for a monumental structure.\"\r\n\r\nSuch an anomalous relationship between interior and exterior is\r\nabsolutely opposed to the fundamental training of the architect of\r\nto-day. Often have I heard my professor of design, a Frenchman of rare\r\njudgment, fly out at a student caught working on his exterior before the\r\ninterior was complete: \"Work on your plan, finish your plan, and when\r\nthat is perfect, the rest will _come_.\"\r\n\r\nArchitects of experience, who have been students of library development\r\nin its every branch, who have followed the changes in the relations of\r\nthe library to the people, have reached the same conclusions along broad\r\nlines, as have the librarians, with respect to lighting, access,\r\noversight and administration, as well as the general correlation of\r\nuniversally important departments, and it is therefore my purpose to\r\nstate our relationship rather than attempt the raising of issues on\r\ndetails of library arrangement, and to show if possible, that the\r\nskilled architect's method of procedure tends to settle mooted points by\r\nweighing values and considering relations of parts in a logical and\r\nbroad minded study of the particular set of conditions pertaining to his\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nEither owing to the size, shape or contour of the site, its particular\r\nexposure, local climatic conditions, the particular character of the\r\nlibrary itself or the people whom it serves, the problem presented to an\r\narchitect by a library board is _always_ essentially a _new_ one.\r\nCertain fundamental rules may obtain through their universal\r\napplicability, but every step in the working out of a successful plan\r\nmust be influenced by the particular conditions referred to, and here\r\nthe co-operation of the librarian is of inestimable value to the\r\narchitect, no matter how wide his experience may be.\r\n\r\nDesired correlation, like most results, can be achieved in divers ways,\r\nand in most cases nothing of utility need be sacrificed to secure a\r\ndignified plan, which is as much to be desired as a dignified exterior.\r\nRealizing the importance of accomplishing successful results, a\r\nscholarly architect will strive to mould his plan with an eye to\r\nsymmetry, without losing sight for an instant of the conditions of use,\r\nand never sacrificing practical relationship to gain an _absolutely_\r\nsymmetrical arrangement of plan.\r\n\r\nThe French architect will, if necessary, waste space or inject needless\r\nrooms into his plan to secure perfect balance, while his American\r\nstudent will gain all the value of the _effect_ without diminishing the\r\npractical value of his building one iota.\r\n\r\nAlong with symmetry, the logical development of the plan in study keeps\r\nin mind something of the rough form of the exterior design, with\r\nparticular reference to the grouping of its masses to secure the maximum\r\nof air and the best light for the various departments. With the best\r\ndesigners, it is an unwritten law, that the next step after completing a\r\nsatisfactory plan, is to sketch a section through the building, not only\r\nto ensure a proper proportion in the enclosed rooms, but most important\r\nof all to secure a system of fenestration, allowing wall space where\r\nneeded and introducing the light as near the top of the rooms as the\r\nfinish will permit. Having settled then all the details of plans and\r\nsection, wherein are comprised all of the matter of greatest moment to\r\nthe practical librarian, it only remains for the architect to prepare a\r\nsuitable exterior and I certainly agree with my old preceptor that \"it\r\nwill come.\" The American people believe that education is the corner\r\nstone of manhood and good citizenship, and next to our public schools,\r\nif not before them, the most potent educational factor is our public\r\nlibrary. The librarians are responsible in a great measure for the good\r\nwork which is being accomplished in the dissemination of knowledge and\r\nculture among the people, but let me ask, are we not as responsible for\r\nour share, as co-workers with them, to perpetuate in lasting masonry the\r\nbest which in us lies for the same great cause of the education of the\r\npeople?\r\n\r\nWhat renaissance has failed to find literature and architecture\r\nquickened alike? The awakening of a love of the beautiful brings a\r\nthirst for knowledge concerning the beautiful; as the records will show,\r\nthe interest excited by that marvellous assemblage of architectural\r\nmasterpieces at the Chicago Fair, created a demand on the libraries\r\nalmost beyond belief for books on architecture and the allied arts.\r\n\r\nEvery conscientious architect must feel his responsibility to his\r\nclients as well as to the people and strive he must, to combine the\r\nideal in convenience with simple beauty in design; my one plea is that\r\nsuch a combination is not only _possible_, but in intelligent hands,\r\nshould be universal, and if my beliefs, hopes and expectations find\r\nsympathy with you, I shall feel repaid in the security of a harmonious\r\nco-operation between architect and librarian in the great work which\r\nstretches ahead of us into the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n      BY JAMES THAYER GEROULD, _University of Missouri, Columbia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent discussion of the departmental library system at the\r\nUniversity of Chicago and the consequent restatement of the position of\r\nthat university in reference to such libraries, together with the\r\nconsideration of the problem in the annual reports of Dr. Canfield and\r\nMr. Lane, have called up anew the question of the expediency of the\r\nsystem. Is the departmental library to be a permanent feature of the\r\nuniversity library? Is the highest effectiveness of a library to be\r\nsecured by a policy of decentralization?\r\n\r\nThe public library has answered the question, finally, it seems, in the\r\naffirmative. Do the arguments which have induced the public librarian to\r\nestablish branches and delivery stations apply in the case of the\r\nuniversity library? Is the university library of the future to be housed\r\nin a single building, or is it to be scattered about in class rooms and\r\nlaboratories? To my mind, there is no more important question of\r\nadministration before those of us who are trying to render the\r\nuniversity library an efficient instrument of instruction than this.\r\n\r\nWith many librarians there is an element of necessity entering into the\r\nquestion. Mr. Lane is facing a condition where the library has\r\naltogether outgrown its building, and some place must be found where\r\nbooks can be stored and used. The situation is much the same in many\r\nother places. Shall the facilities of the library be enlarged by\r\nbuilding or shall the books be transferred to the various departmental\r\nlibraries? Mr. Lane, speaking for his own library, says of the latter\r\nalternative: \"It would commit the library to an entirely different\r\npolicy from what it has pursued hitherto, and such a change would be\r\nlittle short of a revolution for this library.\"\r\n\r\nAt the University of Missouri we are expecting in the near future to\r\nbegin the construction of a library building, but, before adopting any\r\ndefinite plans, we are trying to work out the problems that have just\r\nbeen stated, and to make ourselves reasonably sure that we are right\r\nbefore we go ahead.\r\n\r\nThere are arguments enough on all sides of this question, of which Dr.\r\nCanfield says that it has not two sides only, but a dozen. We must\r\npremise that no two departments use their books in exactly the same way,\r\nand that, consequently, methods of administration must differ. It is\r\ngenerally for the advantage of all, for example, in a university where\r\nthere is a law school, that the books on private law should be separated\r\nfrom the main collection and treated as a branch library. Similarly\r\nmedicine, theology and possibly a few other subjects may be withdrawn\r\nand administered separately.\r\n\r\nIn some of our universities one or more of the departments are several\r\nmiles away from the main body of the institution. It is obviously\r\nnecessary that the books most used in those departments should be near\r\nenough so that the students can have access to them without too much\r\ninconvenience and loss of time. In the ordinary institution, however,\r\nmost of the buildings are grouped in a comparatively small area, and it\r\nis seldom more than five minutes' walk from the most remote building to\r\nthe library. In a condition such as this, and with the exceptions noted\r\nabove, I am inclined to the opinion that the university is best served\r\nby a central library containing the main collection, and small, rigidly\r\nselected laboratory libraries comprising books which from their very\r\nnature are most useful in the laboratory as manuals of work.\r\n\r\nThe arguments generally advanced in favor of the system are these:\r\n\r\n1. The instructor needs to be able to refer, at a moment's notice, to\r\nany book relating to his subject.\r\n\r\n2. The system enables the instructor to keep a more careful watch over\r\nthe reading of his students.\r\n\r\n3. The best interests of the library demand that each division of the\r\nlibrary shall be directly under the eye of the men most interested in\r\nit, that is to say, the instructors in the various departments; that\r\nthey should direct its growth and watch over its interests.\r\n\r\nThat the first and second of these arguments have great weight cannot be\r\ndenied, but with a properly constructed library building and most\r\ncareful administration the requirements of both instructor and student\r\ncan be met quite as well by a central system.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, quite impossible for each instructor to have in his\r\noffice all the books necessary for his work. The duplication necessary\r\nfor this purpose would be impracticable even for the most wealthy\r\nuniversity. He must, therefore, go from his office or class room to the\r\ndepartment library and search for the book himself. With the confusion\r\nwhich generally reigns in a library of this sort, and with the lack of\r\neffective registration of loans, this is quite often a matter of some\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nAt Columbia University the office of each professor is in telephonic\r\ncommunication with the central library. When a book is wanted the\r\nlibrary is notified by telephone, the book is found and sent out at\r\nonce. Within ten minutes from the time that the request reaches the\r\nlibrary the book is generally in the instructor's hands. He may lose two\r\nor three minutes' time, but the amount lost is more than compensated by\r\nthe readiness with which others can use the books of the department, and\r\nby other advantages to be considered later. At Columbia, too, the system\r\nof stack study rooms provides in a very satisfactory way for the second\r\nobjection. There, as many of you have seen, the stacks are distributed\r\nthrough a series of small rooms, the light side of which is supplied\r\nwith tables and used for study rooms and for seminar purposes. If the\r\ninstructor can use the departmental library for his work room, he can\r\ncertainly use this room to as good advantage, for here he has the\r\nentire collection and not a selected few of his books. I believe fully\r\nthat an instructor who is sufficiently interested in the reading of his\r\nstudents to watch over it carefully in his departmental library, will\r\nfind that he is able to keep just as close a relation to it, if his\r\nstudents are working in a central library. He may be obliged to make\r\nslight changes in his methods, but the result ought to be the same.\r\n\r\nThe third argument in favor of the departmental library system is of a\r\ndifferent nature. Is the librarian or the professor best qualified to\r\ndirect the growth and watch over the interests of the different\r\ndepartments of the library? So far as I know, this argument is given\r\nmore consideration at Chicago than anywhere else. It may be true, in\r\ncertain cases, that the professor has the greater qualification for this\r\nwork, but when this is the case it argues that the professor is an\r\nexceptional one or that the university has been unfortunate in the\r\nselection of its librarian.\r\n\r\nIt is quite needless to say that the librarian should be in constant\r\nconference with the teaching force regarding purchases, but that he\r\nshould delegate all of his powers of purchase in any given field, admits\r\nof the gravest doubt. Laude, in his recent work on the university\r\nlibrary system of Germany, attributes a great deal of the success of\r\nthose libraries to the fact that they are independent and autonomous\r\ninstitutions, enjoying a much greater measure of freedom than is\r\naccorded to any similar American institution. Too many professors are\r\napt to buy books in their special field and slight other lines of\r\nresearch in their own subject. For example, a zoologist, who is doing\r\nresearch work along the lines of embryology, is very apt to overload the\r\ncollection at that point and neglect other equally important lines.\r\n\r\nAgain, very few instructors, even granting them the qualifications\r\nnecessary for the work, have the time or patience for it. If the amount\r\nappropriated to the department is at all large, a considerable portion\r\nof the sum is quite frequently unexpended at the end of the year. Some\r\ninteresting tables, prepared by Mr. Winsor for his report for the year\r\n1894-95, show that in seven selected departments the amount of books\r\nordered, including continuations, was only about 50 per cent. of the\r\nappropriation, plus one quarter, the allowance for orders not filled.\r\nWhile this proportion would probably not hold good in all departments or\r\nin all places, it exhibits an almost uniform tendency and a tendency\r\nwhich must be corrected if a well-rounded out library is to be secured.\r\n\r\nThe system of departmental control is very sure to create a feeling of\r\ndepartmental ownership, a feeling that the books, bought out of the\r\nmoneys appropriated to a particular library, should remain permanently\r\nin that library, and that any one from outside who wishes to use the\r\nbooks is more or less of an intruder. Pin any one of these men down, and\r\nthey will admit that the books are for the use of all, but the feeling\r\nexists, notwithstanding, and is the cause of constant friction.\r\n\r\nThe departmental library renders the books difficult of access. If the\r\nlibrary is large enough to warrant the setting apart of a separate room\r\nfor its use, this room can seldom be open for as large a portion of the\r\nday as the central library, and when it is open the books cannot be\r\nobtained as readily by the great body of the students as if they were in\r\na central building. Most students are working in several lines at once.\r\nThey are compelled, by this system, to go from one room to another, and\r\nto accommodate themselves to differing hours of opening and to varying\r\nrules for the use of the books. Then, too, it frequently happens in the\r\ncase of small libraries that the books are kept in the office of the\r\nhead of the department, and can only be consulted when he is in his\r\noffice and at liberty. The difficulty is here greatly increased. I know\r\nof cases where even the instructors in the same department have found\r\ndifficulty in getting at the books, and the library was, in effect, a\r\nprivate library for the head professor, supported out of university\r\nfunds. If instructors cannot use the books, how can the student be\r\nexpected to do so?\r\n\r\nThere is a sentiment, false, perhaps, but nevertheless existing in the\r\nminds of many students, that any attempt to use the books under these\r\ncircumstances is an endeavor to curry favor with the professor. This\r\nfeeling does not exist in connection with the use of the books at a\r\ncentral library.\r\n\r\nIf a book in a departmental library is needed by a student in another\r\ndepartment, he must either go to the department and put the custodian to\r\nthe inconvenience of looking it up for him, or he must wait at the\r\ncentral library while a messenger goes for the book. His need of the\r\nbook must be very pressing before he will do either.\r\n\r\nIf the different fields of knowledge were sharply defined, the\r\ndepartmental system might be a practicable one, but such is not the\r\ncase. The psychologist needs books bearing on philosophy, sociology,\r\nzoology and physics, the sociologist gathers his data from almost the\r\nwhole field of human knowledge, the economist must use books on history\r\nand the historian books on economics. The system hampers him exceedingly\r\nin the selection and use of his material, or it compels the university\r\nto purchase a large body of duplicate material, and restricts, by so\r\nmuch, the growth of the real resources of the library.\r\n\r\nThe system, it seems to me, induces narrowness of vision and a sort of\r\nspecialization which is anything but scientific. Trending in the same\r\ndirection is the separation of the books, in any given field, into two\r\ncategories. The undergraduate may need some such selection, but any\r\nstudent who has gone beyond the elements of his subject should have at\r\nhis command the entire resources of the library. The needs of the\r\nelementary student can be met by direct reference to certain books, or\r\nby setting aside the volumes required as special reference books and\r\nallowing free access to them.\r\n\r\nA large amount of our most valuable material is found in the\r\npublications of scientific and literary societies and in periodicals. In\r\nmany cases these must be kept at the central library. They will be much\r\nmore frequently read if the readers are using the central library and\r\navailing themselves of the information given in the catalog.\r\n\r\nFrom the administrative point of view, there is nothing impossible in\r\nthe organization of the departmental system, provided that finances of\r\nthe library admit of the increased expenditure. As Mr. Bishop has\r\npointed out in a recent number of the _Library Journal_, the element of\r\ncost seems to have been utterly left out of consideration in the recent\r\ndiscussions at the University of Chicago. It is possible that, with the\r\nimmense resources of that institution, they may be able to ignore that\r\nfactor, but most of us are compelled to reduce administrative\r\nexpenditures to the lowest point consistent with good work.\r\n\r\nAside from the cost of the duplication of books already noted,\r\nnecessitated by the division of the books among the different\r\ndepartments, there are the items of space and labor to be considered. It\r\nneeds no argument to show that there is a great economy of space gained\r\nby the consolidation of all libraries, with the exceptions previously\r\nreferred to, into one central building. An entire room is frequently\r\ngiven up to a departmental library of three or four hundred volumes,\r\nwhen a few extra shelves and possibly a slight increase in the seating\r\ncapacity of the reading room would accommodate it in the central\r\nlibrary. The cost of maintenance, of heating and of lighting is also\r\nundoubtedly greater under the departmental arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe greatest increase in expense is, however, in the item of service. In\r\norder properly to control a branch of this sort, an employe of the\r\nlibrary must be in constant attendance. The duties and responsibilities\r\nof such a position are so small that only the lowest paid grade of\r\nservice can be employed with economy. The amount necessary to pay the\r\nsalaries of such persons could, with much greater advantage to the whole\r\ninstitution, be used for the employment of a few specialists, highly\r\ntrained in different lines, who would act as reference librarians in\r\ntheir respective fields. Our American libraries are, as a class,\r\ncompared with those of foreign universities, singularly deficient in\r\nthis quality of assistance. Sooner or later we must supply this lack,\r\nand every move which tends in another direction must be examined with\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe university library exists for the whole university--all of it for\r\nthe whole university. In an ideal condition, every book in it should be\r\navailable, at a moment's notice, if it is not actually in use. This\r\nshould be our aim, and it should be from this viewpoint that we should\r\njudge the efficiency of our administration and the value of any proposed\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUGGESTIONS FOR AN ANNUAL LIST OF AMERICAN THESES FOR THE DEGREE OF\r\n                         DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\n   BY WILLIAM WARNER BISHOP, _Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduate instruction and the degree of doctor of philosophy as its\r\nreward are not so novel and recent in America as to call for either\r\nexplanation or definition. Neither are they so old as to require a\r\nhistory. Most of us can well remember when it became a common thing for\r\nAmerican universities to have numerous candidates for the doctorate. At\r\nthe present time there are several hundred students in our universities\r\nwho are candidates for the doctor's degree and the number is increasing\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nA degree implies a dissertation, or, as it is more commonly and less\r\ncorrectly termed, a thesis. I need not here express any opinion as to\r\nthe merits or defects of these documents as a class. What I wish to\r\nspeak of is their value to university and college libraries, and the\r\ndifficulty of discovering what dissertations are produced annually, and,\r\nfor reference libraries, of procuring them when discovered. I presume\r\nthe librarian who knows the specialist's insatiate greed for\r\ndissertations, _programmen_, and small pamphlets generally will need no\r\nwords of mine to bring home to him the need of procuring as many of\r\nthese documents as he can. Whatever we may say in derogation of doctors'\r\ndissertations--and they have their faults--they at least represent\r\nlong-continued and careful investigation under supposedly competent\r\ndirection, and the specialist must have them.\r\n\r\nIt is a comparatively easy task to get him German and other foreign\r\ndissertations. The new ones are listed annually and the old ones load\r\nthe shelves of the second-hand stores of Europe. But to find what is\r\nbeing produced here in this country is by no means a simple undertaking.\r\nAnd it behooves us, unless we tacitly admit that our American\r\ndissertations are not worth having, to take some steps toward bettering\r\nthe present situation.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the exact condition of things I have selected\r\nfifteen representative institutions which confer the degree of Doctor of\r\nPhilosophy and have studied their requirements and conducted some\r\ncorrespondence with their librarians. These institutions have been\r\nselected purely as representing various geographical and educational\r\nconditions, and omissions from the list are not to be taken _in malam\r\npartem_. They are: (1) Brown, (2) Bryn Mawr, (3) California, (4)\r\nChicago, (5) Columbia, (6) Cornell, (7) Harvard, (8) Johns Hopkins, (9)\r\nMichigan, (10) Nebraska, (11) Pennsylvania, (12) Princeton, (13)\r\nStanford, (14) Wisconsin, and (15) Yale.\r\n\r\nThe majority of these universities require that before the degree is\r\nconferred the thesis shall be printed and a fixed number of copies,\r\nranging from 50 to 250, shall be deposited with some officer of the\r\nuniversity or in the library. The statistics are as follows:\r\n\r\nCalifornia requires 150 copies.\r\n\r\nChicago requires 100 copies. \"Accepted theses become the property of the\r\nuniversity.\"\r\n\r\nColumbia requires 150 copies.\r\n\r\nCornell requires 50 copies.\r\n\r\nMichigan requires 150 copies.\r\n\r\nNebraska requires 150 copies.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania requires 250 copies.\r\n\r\nStanford requires 100 copies.\r\n\r\nWisconsin requires 100 copies.\r\n\r\nTwo institutions, Bryn Mawr and Princeton, require the printing of the\r\nthesis, but make no requirement, so far as can be ascertained from the\r\ncatalogs, that there shall be any deposit of copies.\r\n\r\nJohns Hopkins and Pennsylvania allow the thesis to be either written or\r\nprinted; if printed, Johns Hopkins requires the deposit of 150 copies,\r\nPennsylvania of 250, except under certain conditions which will appear\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nBrown makes no requirement for deposit or for printing. Harvard\r\nprovides that one copy either printed or written must be deposited in\r\nthe library. Yale requires that the \"thesis must be deposited at the\r\nlibrary for public inspection not later than May 1st\" of the year in\r\nwhich the candidate expects to receive the degree.\r\n\r\nOf these universities two only, Brown and California, print the titles\r\nof theses in the university catalog.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements are taken from the annual catalogs for\r\n1899-1900 of the universities named, except in the case of Pennsylvania,\r\nwhere the statement made in the catalog is supplemented from a letter\r\nreceived from the Dean.\r\n\r\nAlthough I presumed that most of the copies deposited in the libraries\r\nof the universities were used for exchange, I wrote to the librarians of\r\nthose universities which require the deposit of a number of printed\r\ncopies, making inquiry regarding their systems of exchange and\r\nprovisions for the sale of copies not exchanged. I received replies from\r\nalmost all. [These letters were read, the common condition being shown\r\nto be that most of the copies received by the libraries were exchanged\r\nwith foreign institutions and other American universities. Varying\r\nconditions ranging from a refusal to sell any copies to a free\r\ndistribution of copies not exchanged, was found to exist with regard to\r\nsale of theses by the libraries.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from these replies that, if a library does not happen to\r\nbe on the exchange list of the university in which a thesis is written,\r\nand if the thesis is not printed in some journal or in the proceedings\r\nof some learned society, such a library stands very little chance either\r\nof learning of the publication of a thesis or of procuring it from the\r\nauthor or from the university. That this is not much of an affliction in\r\nmost cases I cheerfully admit. Still the small colleges which\r\ndeliberately refuse to attempt graduate work--and, be it said to their\r\nhonor, there are not a few of these--and the large reference libraries\r\nwhich do not publish, have as much need of certain theses as the large\r\nuniversities, and they have no means of getting them easily.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, and I trust to you, that, if our American\r\ndissertations are worth anything, if they are valuable enough to\r\npreserve, if they are real contributions to knowledge--and I believe\r\nthat they are all of these--then it is worth while to secure the\r\npublication of some list which will tell librarians and specialists\r\nwhere to go to get copies, either from the author or from the\r\nuniversity. It should not be difficult to secure co-operation in this\r\nmatter. The number of theses printed and deposited in any one university\r\nin any one year is not large, and it certainly would not be a burden of\r\nalarming proportions to send titles to some central bureau. The\r\ndifficulty will be to secure an editor and the funds for publishing the\r\nlist. It would seem to me that some one of the large institutions whose\r\nlibraries publish bulletins and other matter, or possibly the Library of\r\nCongress might assume the expense as a matter of patriotic service to\r\nlearning in the United States. And it might not be out of place for this\r\nsection, should it care to follow up the matter, to enter into\r\ncommunication with them on the subject. It might be also, that some\r\nenterprising publisher would be glad to undertake the task of both\r\nediting and publishing, if it could be shown him that he would thus do a\r\nfavor to American libraries.\r\n\r\nOne final word should be said before closing. The inevitable delays\r\nincident to the publication of such a list would be more than offset by\r\nthe delays in publishing theses. Many a man is called \"Doctor\" who has\r\nnever received his diploma for that degree because his thesis remains\r\nunpublished. The laxity in this matter in some quarters is very great.\r\nIt may be that such a publication of titles as I have proposed might\r\nperceptibly hasten the publication of theses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OPPORTUNITIES.\r\n\r\n      BY GRATIA COUNTRYMAN, _Minneapolis (Minn.) Public Library_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were to sum up in these short moments the opportunities which lie\r\nbefore library workers, it would have to be an epitome of all that has\r\nbeen said at this conference and all previous conferences, and of all\r\nthat has been written on library extension and influence. Even then the\r\nopportunity which lies before you might not even be mentioned.\r\n\r\nI will not even try to enumerate the almost endless ways in which\r\nlibrary usefulness may express itself, for these various ways are, after\r\nall, only different directions in which to use our one great opportunity\r\nof service to mankind.\r\n\r\nMay we not think of a library as a dynamic force in the community, to be\r\nused for lifting the common level. There are so many forces at work in\r\nthe nation pulling down and scattering; but the hundreds of large and\r\nsmall libraries dotted over the country stand for social regeneration,\r\nstand for the building up and perfecting of human society, stand for the\r\njoy and happiness of individual lives. And no matter how limited seems\r\nour own small field, it is a piece of the great domain of helpful\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy, after a hard and tiresome day of small and\r\nperplexing duties, to see beyond our wall of weariness. Yet nothing is\r\nmore restful than to feel that we are contributing our part to a great\r\nwork, and that we, in our place, are a part of one of the great\r\nbuilding-up movements of the century.\r\n\r\nI will not soon forget what Mr. Lane said in his president's address at\r\nthe Atlanta conference. I would like to quote largely, but this sentence\r\nserves. He said: \"What a privilege that we are always free to place\r\nourselves at the service of another. Most professions are so engrossed\r\nby their own work that they have no time to serve the needs of others,\r\nbut it is the _business_ of the librarian to serve. He is paid for\r\nknowing how.\"\r\n\r\nIt is peculiarly true that the librarian's business is to put himself\r\nand the library under his custody at the complete disposal of the\r\npeople. It is his _business_ to watch their interests and to think in\r\nadvance for their needs.\r\n\r\nThe librarian must have, in Mrs. Browning's words,\r\n\r\n  \"... both head and heart;\r\n  Both active, both complete and both in earnest.\"\r\n\r\nOur opportunities, then, are not something which lie to one side, to be\r\nespecially thought of, but are the very heart of our business--of our\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nI have been wondering if there is not an element of discouragement to\r\nthe librarian of the small library, in such a conference as this, or\r\neven to us who fill subordinate places in large libraries. We get so\r\nmany new ideas, we get so many plans which other libraries are putting\r\ninto operation. We know we cannot put them into practice, we know well\r\nenough that we shall go home and do just what we have been doing, with\r\nsmall quarters, with cramped revenues, with possibly unsympathetic\r\ntrustees who take unkindly to our new-born enthusiasm. There seems to be\r\nthe possibility of so much, but the opportunity for doing so little, and\r\nthen our limitations seem more apparent than our opportunities. The\r\nassistant in the larger library says, \"I wish I could be the librarian\r\nof a small library, they have so much better an opportunity for coming\r\ninto close contact with the people,\" and the librarian of the little\r\nlibrary who does her own accessioning, cataloging, record keeping,\r\ncharging, reference work, etc., with one brain and one pair of hands,\r\nsays, \"Oh, if we were only a little larger library, with more money, and\r\nwith more help, I might do so many things that other libraries do.\"\r\n\r\nCarlyle says, \"Not what I have, but what I do, is my kingdom,\" and I\r\ntake that to mean in library work that my opportunity is not what I\r\ncould do if I held some other position in some other library, but what I\r\ncan do under present conditions with present means. Success does not lie\r\nwith those who continually wish for something they haven't got, but\r\nwith those who do the best possible thing with the things they have. \"It\r\nis not so much the ship as the skilful sailing that assures a prosperous\r\nvoyage.\" It is not so much a great collection of books and a fine\r\ntechnical organization as the personal character of the man or woman who\r\nstands as a bridge between the books and the people. Your opportunity\r\nand mine does not lie in our circumstances, but in ourselves, and in our\r\nability to see and to grasp the coveted opportunity. We are reminded of\r\nthe pious darkey who prayed every night just before Christmas, \"Dear\r\nLord, send dis darkey a turkey.\" Christmas came dangerously near, and\r\nthere was no prospect of a turkey. So the night before Christmas he grew\r\ndesperate, and prayed, \"Dear Lord, send dis darkey to a turkey.\" That\r\nnight the turkey came. Even so it is with our opportunities.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of people toward whom the library has a special\r\nmission: the children, the foreigner, and the working classes.\r\n\r\n1. As to the children, we have been hearing considerably about them in\r\nthis conference. Mr. Hutchins in the Wisconsin meeting said that a good\r\nbook did more good in a country boy's home than in the city boy's. When\r\nthe country boy takes a book home he and all his family devour it, but\r\nthe town boy reads his book and exchanges it, and no one in the house\r\nperhaps even knows that he has read it. Well, that is a subject for\r\nthought. If his family or teachers do not watch his reading, it becomes\r\na serious thing for the librarian who chooses and buys his books for\r\nhim. Perhaps the library is not large enough to have a children's\r\ndepartment or to send books into the schools, or to do any specialized\r\nchildren's work, but it can make judicious selection of books, and being\r\nsmall can know individual cases among the children. It is not so hard to\r\nfind out the children one by one who need some care and interest, to\r\nlearn their names and to find out something about their families. They\r\nsay that letters cut lightly in the bark of a sapling show even more\r\nplainly in the grown tree. A boy whom no one has reached comes into your\r\nlibrary. By a little watchful care he reads some wonderful life, learns\r\nsome of the marvellous forces in God's creation, opens his eyes to the\r\nglowing sunsets or to the springing blades of grass; suddenly knows the\r\ndignity of human nature and his own growing self. His aspirations are\r\nborn, his ambition is awakened, his life is changed. Library records\r\nhave not one, but many such cases.\r\n\r\nThe home library is a method of reaching children which is not used\r\nenough by the smaller libraries. Branches and stations may not be\r\npracticable, but a group of 15 to 25 books taken into sections of a town\r\nby some friendly woman, on the plan of the home libraries, could be\r\ncarried out in almost any town. The librarian might not have time, but\r\nshe could find people who would do it, if she set the work to going.\r\n\r\n2. As to the foreigners, Europe has used us for a dumping ground for\r\nconsiderable moral and political refuse. We have the problem of making\r\ngood citizens out of much wretched material, and next to the children\r\nthere is no greater opportunity for the library. Even the smallest\r\nlibrary ought to study ways and means of getting at the foreign element.\r\nIt would almost pay to make a canvass of the town, to see that these\r\npeople are reached and that they know about the library. If books in\r\ntheir own language are necessary to draw them, then it is the best\r\ninvestment you can make.\r\n\r\n3. But in reality the library does its great work among the mass of\r\ncommon working people. It is the quiet side which makes no showing, but\r\nit has always been the telling side. From the common people spring most\r\nof our readers. They do our work, they fight our battles, they need our\r\ninspiration. For them you make your libraries attractive, for them you\r\nmake careful selections of books--the student does not need your\r\npains--for their sake you identify yourself with every local interest.\r\nYou fix your hours for opening and closing to accommodate these working\r\npeople. You make your rules and regulations just as elastic as possible,\r\nthat they may not be debarred from any privilege. They do not ask\r\nfavors, but after all this great mass of common people whose lives are\r\nmore or less barren and empty are the ones to which the library caters\r\nin a quiet, unadvertised way. It is the great opportunity which we\r\nscarcely think of as an opportunity at all. It is just the daily\r\nroutine. Millions of people know little more than a mechanical life,\r\nwhat they shall eat, drink and wear. Many can touch their horizons all\r\naround with a sweep of their hands, so narrow is their circle. They live\r\nin the basements of their spiritual temples, and never rise to the level\r\nof their best ability. They have no joy of life, of abundant life. The\r\nlibrary performs a great service to society when it has furnished\r\ninformation to the people, when it has been an educational factor, but\r\nit has performed a greater one when it has awakened a man and put him\r\ninto possession of his own powers.\r\n\r\nWell, this is not a very specific setting forth of the ways in which we\r\ncan extend the work of a small library. The way must vary greatly with\r\nthe conditions, but the spirit of the work runs through all conditions.\r\nIf I should name the qualifications of a good librarian, I would give\r\nthem in the following order, according to importance:\r\n\r\n1. Genuine character, with broad natural sympathies.\r\n\r\n2. Courteous, kindly manners.\r\n\r\n3. Education, general and technical.\r\n\r\nAny such librarian, with only a fairly equipped library, will find her\r\nopportunity at her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             SOME PRINCIPLES OF BOOK AND PICTURE SELECTION.\r\n\r\n  BY G. E. WIRE, M.D., LL.B., _Worcester County (Mass.) Law Library_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Books and pictures should be suited to the constituency._--This may\r\nseem so trite, so self-evident as to need no statement, much less any\r\nargument to support it. But on sober second thought, all will agree that\r\nit needs constant reiteration and appreciation. All of us are familiar\r\nwith libraries--of course not our own--in which we detect glaring\r\ninconsistencies in book selection. The story used to be told of one\r\nlibrary commission that in its first epoch it used to send the books on\r\nagriculture to the sea-coast, and books on fish curing to the hill\r\ncountry. This is now strenuously denied but there may be more truth than\r\npoetry in it after all.\r\n\r\nIn the case of large, 50,000 v. libraries and over, less care need be\r\ntaken, both on account of expenditure of money and on account of\r\nworthlessness of the book itself. A few hundred dollars' worth of\r\nrubbish, more or less, does not count and almost any book no matter how\r\npoor comes in use some time. But in the case of the small, 5000 v.\r\nlibrary or under, with little money to expend and the whole realm of\r\nknowledge to cover, it is different. Of course the covering will be\r\nscanty and thin, but it will do for the first layer. They should buy but\r\nfew books in philosophy and religion, more in sociology, only the latest\r\nand most popular in the arts and sciences, comparatively fewer in\r\nliterature and more in history, biography and travel.\r\n\r\nOf course fiction, adult and juvenile, must also be bought and at first\r\na disproportionately larger amount in many cases. Too much reliance\r\nshould not be placed on what some larger library has or on what the\r\nneighboring library has.\r\n\r\nAvoid imitation and duplication, especially the latter. Now that\r\ninter-library loans are coming in, each small library in the more\r\nthickly settled portions of the country may be able to supplement its\r\nneighbor. Travelling libraries should also help out the smaller\r\nlibraries which can ill afford to sink a large part of their annual\r\nbook-fund in evanescent fiction, which soon moulds on the shelves.\r\n\r\nAs the commissions become better organized, they should also be able to\r\nsend expensive reference works for the use of study clubs, and so help\r\nthe small libraries all the more.\r\n\r\nThe needs of the constituency should be carefully studied and the most\r\npressing should be attended to at first, others can wait. As to buying\r\ntechnical books for those engaged in manufacturing, I think a more\r\nconservative policy is now favored. Better wait a while and feel your\r\nway before spending much on these high priced books which rapidly go out\r\nof date. Theoretically the operatives of a cotton mill should be much\r\ninterested in all that relates to cotton, but practically when their\r\nhours of drudgery are over they are more inclined to a novel, if\r\ninclined to read anything. And how much encouragement have they to read\r\nin most factories? Better begin with the owners, who may be on your\r\nboard, or the superintendent, who may live on your street. As liberal\r\npurchases as possible should be made in reference books--always\r\nselecting the latest and freshest to start on. For example Seyffert's\r\n\"Antiquities,\" Bulfinch's \"Age of fable,\" and Murray's \"Mythology\" will\r\nserve better than Smith's books, now out of date and expensive beyond\r\nall return for the money invested in them. More will be said along this\r\nline under head of cost. Of course in a library of this size, no foreign\r\nbooks should be bought other than perhaps some fiction.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly believe in America for Americans. Foreigners would not buy\r\nour books under the same circumstances and why should we buy theirs?\r\nReciprocity is good policy. Even in the case of English books most of\r\nthose on geology, botany, zoology, on fishing and hunting, are valueless\r\nto us, by reason of climatic, or other local conditions. Their local\r\nhistory and antiquities are quite as unprofitable for most of our public\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\n2. _As to the matter of outside experts._--Most of us have seen bad\r\nexamples of the work of outside experts, in fact I think we are safe in\r\nsaying there are more bad than good examples. In the case of arts and\r\nsciences it is quite the fashion to refer the book list to the nearest\r\nhigh school or college professor, with the idea that in his line he\r\nknows all there is to be known about these books. In some cases he is\r\npractically given _carte blanche_ and his selection is bought without a\r\nmurmur. The natural consequence is that in many libraries are to be\r\nfound high priced technical works of momentary interest, fit only for\r\nclass-room or laboratory use, too deep for general reading and soon out\r\nof date. Most of these so-called experts are not even competent to\r\nselect works for their own department, let alone the public library.\r\n\r\nPersonal bias, the quarrels of investigators, loyalty to instructors,\r\njealousy of other workers in the same lines are powerful factors which\r\nfar outweigh the question of real merit. In New England many of the\r\nlibraries are overloaded with good, blue, orthodox theology, bought on\r\nthe suggestion and for the sole use of the dominie who was on the\r\nlibrary committee. It was a glorious opportunity for him and it has\r\nrarely been neglected. These libraries are now really addicted to this\r\nhabit; it has become a species of intoxication with them and they\r\ncontinue the pernicious practice.\r\n\r\n3. _Choice by committee._--One of the latest fads is selection by voting\r\nor by committee. This usually results in a mediocre selection, all the\r\nreally good books or pictures being left out, or else a preponderance of\r\nvotes for a few favorites. Voting choice is seen in the list of books\r\nsent out each year from New York State Library as a result of voting by\r\nmembers of the New York State Library Association. This is a list of the\r\n50 best books for a village library from a list of 500 books, including\r\nfiction, adult and juvenile. Of course fiction takes a large per cent.,\r\nwhile the remaining few books make a most patchy lot. The first list is\r\ntoo large and the last list is too small. Another publication by the\r\nRegents of the State of New York is a list of pictures for schools--not\r\nso much selected as neglected by a jury of 75 persons. Between religious\r\nprejudice, prudishness, peace policy and finical art criticism only the\r\nhusks of architecture and stately ruins are left for the youths of the\r\nEmpire State to gaze upon. Think of leaving out the \"Sistine Madonna,\"\r\n\"1807,\" \"Christ in the Temple,\" \"Queen Louise\" and the \"Horse fair.\"\r\nSome of these were omitted in cold blood because they were \"poor and\r\npopular\" and \"pupils would like them and should not.\" Most of us,\r\nhowever, have gotten beyond the idea of trying to make people read\r\nGeorge Eliot when they want Mary Jane Holmes. Nothing I have seen in the\r\nnature of criticism is so cold, hard and repelling as this. It is to be\r\nhoped no other state will follow this example, but that is just the\r\nperniciousness of such lists made out by people who are supposed to be\r\nexperts, but who too often fail worse than common mortals. This whole\r\nmatter of selection by committee is virtually begging the question of\r\nindividual responsibility.\r\n\r\n4. _Choice by librarian experts._--This seems to be the most\r\nsatisfactory solution of the problem. It is true that many if not most\r\nof the existing small (5000-10,000) libraries have not or can not afford\r\na trained librarian. But it is also true that more and more are\r\nemploying trained people as organizers and an increasing number are\r\nretaining their organizer as librarian. It is their study and their\r\nbusiness to know what books are best suited to the needs of the\r\ncommunity. Even should we go beyond that into the larger public library,\r\nthe reference library or the college library I still hold that the\r\nlibrarian is the best judge of books for the library. His taste is sure\r\nto be more catholic, wholly unbiassed and he makes a more even and\r\nbetter rounded selection on the whole. In the small public library he is\r\nable to carefully study the constituency and then knowing what books are\r\nstandard in other places he makes the necessary allowances for the case\r\nin hand. The time has, I trust, wholly gone by when the local editor,\r\nlocal clergyman, and local schoolmaster have the pleasure of picking out\r\ntheir favorite books, or of ordering \"standard sets\" or the \"classics\"\r\nin history and literature at the public expense. Most of these books are\r\non the shelves to-day faded but not worn, the leaves not even cut and\r\nusually only the first volume slightly used.\r\n\r\nOf course books in useful art and sciences were largely overlooked.\r\nNowadays library committees are turning more and more to the librarian,\r\nknowing that he has made a study of book selection and that they will\r\nget better results to leave it with him. This is as it should be and the\r\nlibrarian should not lower himself by going outside for assistance on\r\nany line. I count it as slipshod and a confession of ignorance for any\r\nlibrarian to tag around after outside \"experts.\" Let him study up his\r\nsubject and master it himself. There are only a few in which he cannot\r\neasily surpass outsiders, and profiting by his knowledge of the many,\r\nwhich enables him to do that part quickly and easily, let him pay more\r\nattention to the hard and less familiar subjects. The librarian who\r\ndelights in religion, philosophy or folklore says of lists on biology,\r\nbotany, steam-engineering or sanitation--\"I leave all that to Professor\r\nSo and So--of course he knows all about it.\" Why should he, more than\r\nthe librarian? What is the librarian for, if not to know things? Is it\r\nnot time to turn from the material things and concern ourselves more\r\nwith a higher standard of scholarship and more outside work in our\r\nprofession? And for the small libraries of 5000 v. or under there are\r\nthe library commissions who are supposed to, and do, advise them. There\r\nis difference with the commissions, some are in closer touch with the\r\nlocal situation than others, some are more conscientious than others\r\nabout costly books, and some are given to this \"expert\" business which I\r\nhave named, but on the whole they are doing good work and bid fair to do\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n5. _Matter of cost._--This should be carefully considered. I hold it to\r\nbe little short of criminal to recommend high priced books for libraries\r\nof limited means. By high priced books I mean those costing over $5 a\r\nvolume. This of course does not apply to reference books. And yet in one\r\nannual list such books constantly appear, as not only suggestions but,\r\nconsidering the source, as recommendations or even commands. I am\r\nthankful the Wisconsin Library Commission has taken up this work\r\nsystematically and is doing all it can to discourage such foolish waste\r\nof money. The worst example is the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" now from 25\r\nto 10 years behind the times and never a satisfactory book of reference\r\nat its best. Take De Bry's \"Mycetazoa,\" it stands on the shelves of\r\ndozens of libraries, leaves uncut, totally unused, each copy meaning at\r\nleast four dollars wasted money. These are only given as an\r\nexample--there might be hundreds of them. There are scores of books now\r\npublished and more coming out every day on various questions of\r\nphilosophy, sociology, science, art and particularly literature and\r\nhistory priced from $1 to $2.50 which are far superior for practical\r\npurposes to the heavy weight monographs at $5 a volume and upwards. You\r\nthus get two or three books on the same subject for the money, and in a\r\nsmall library this is a vital question. The money must bring in the\r\nlargest possible number of good books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n BOOK REVIEWS, BOOK LISTS, AND ARTICLES ON CHILDREN'S READING: ARE THEY\r\n            OF PRACTICAL VALUE TO THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN?\r\n\r\n        BY CAROLINE M. HEWINS, _Hartford (Ct.) Public Library_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA children's librarian has three sources of reliance in the choice or\r\npurchase of books. They are: 1, Book reviews in current or earlier\r\nperiodicals; 2, Lists, graded or ungraded, for libraries; 3, Articles on\r\nchildren's reading in books or periodicals.\r\n\r\n1. The children's librarian, or any librarian, who orders children's\r\nbooks from reviews often finds the books entirely different from what\r\nthe description has led her to suppose. Even if there is no positive\r\nuntruth in a notice, it is often misleading from the lack of a standard\r\nof comparison with the best books for children.\r\n\r\nThe papers oftenest taken in a country household or small library are a\r\ndaily or semi-weekly from the nearest large town or city, a religious\r\nweekly, and an agricultural weekly or monthly, sometimes all three,\r\noftener only one or two, and it is from the notices and advertisements\r\nwith quoted notices in these papers that estimates of books must often\r\nbe formed. Libraries and library trustees who send book lists from such\r\nsources as these to a state public library commission are often\r\nsurprised that they do not receive what they ask for, and write anxious\r\ninquiries as to why certain books have not been bought. \"There surely\r\ncan be no objection to them,\" they say, \"for we took the titles from\r\nreviews in the ---- or ---- or ----,\" naming denominational papers. Now,\r\nlest the Children's Section should be accused of unfairness and\r\ndenominational prejudices, I shall quote no reviews from these papers,\r\nexcept one which came from a leading religious weekly taken by the\r\nhousehold in whose pew I have a seat. It is of Eden Phillpotts' \"Human\r\nboy,\" a series of sketches of English schoolboy life, which is dismissed\r\nwith this remarkable sentence: \"The scene here, too, is in the west, and\r\nvarious hunting experiences are recorded.\" The librarian who orders that\r\nbook for boys greedy for big game will be disappointed!\r\n\r\nSuch a mistake as this is not common, but reviews in both religious and\r\nsecular papers are often perfunctory and meaningless. One reason of this\r\nis that many books are published for the Christmas trade, between the\r\n15th of September and the 15th of December, when they come into\r\nnewspaper offices with a rush, until they are piled in stacks on the\r\ndesk of the hapless reviewer, and hastily noticed, sometimes by title\r\nonly. In a new edition of Elizabeth Sheppard's fine, but forgotten\r\nnovel, \"Rumour,\" whose keynote is the quotation from \"Lycidas\" on the\r\ntitle-page,\r\n\r\n  \"Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,\r\n  Nor in the glistering foil\r\n  Set off to the world, nor in broad Rumour lies,\r\n  But lives and spreads aloft in those pure eyes\r\n  And perfect witness of all-judging Jove,\"\r\n\r\nthe reviewer did not understand the meaning of the lines, and called the\r\nbook \"a good example of the working, influence, and effect of rumour.\"\r\nOn one of our own local papers not long ago there was a review of Mrs.\r\nBarr's \"Maid of Maiden Lane,\" which was referred to as the sequel to her\r\n\"Beau of Orange River.\" Even in newspapers fortunate enough to command\r\nthe services of specialists for history and science, and an additional\r\ncritic for novels, the children's books are hastily noticed, sometimes\r\nby the youngest reporter in his spare minutes. In smaller offices the\r\ntask of reviewing all books falls to the hard-worked editor, who is,\r\nlike Jacob Riis, also his own \"reporter, publisher and advertising\r\nagent,\" but whose sense of literary values is often not in proportion to\r\nhis knowledge of state politics or local reforms.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that in the newspapers of as high a class as the\r\n_Outlook_, _Independent_ and _Dial_ the notices of children's books are\r\noften carelessly written, and show the lack of a standard of comparison.\r\nIn the _Outlook_ for Nov. 27, 1897, Richard Pryce's \"Elementary Jane,\"\r\na most unchildlike book, is classed among books for children, and\r\n\"Pansy\" and \"Elsie\" are recommended in other numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the _Independent_, where notices of books for older readers are\r\nwritten with discrimination, Ellis's \"Klondike nuggets\" is described:\r\n\"Full of lively adventures and exciting experiences, and is told in a\r\nstraightforward, off-hand style just suited to the purpose.\" (Oct. 6,\r\n1898.) There is nothing absolutely untrue in this, but there is nothing\r\nto guide a reader in comparing it with better books. One of Alger's\r\nheroes is mentioned as \"An admirable boy with wonderful ability to take\r\ncare of himself\" (Oct. 20, 1898), and a book by Stratemeyer as \"a\r\nstirring tale, told with enthusiasm.\" (Oct. 6, 1898.) Stratemeyer is an\r\nauthor who mixes \"would\" and \"should,\" has the phraseology of a country\r\nnewspaper, as when he calls a supper \"an elegant affair\" and a girl \"a\r\nfashionable miss,\" and follows Oliver Optic closely in his plots and\r\nconversations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cheever's \"Little Mr. Van Vere of China,\" with its cheap sentiment\r\nand well-worn plot of a stolen child coming to his own at last, is\r\ncommended as \"well made, well illustrated.\" (_Dial_, Dec. 6, 1898.) A\r\nnotice in the religious paper mentioned above says, \"He is a thoroughly\r\nfascinating little fellow, and his story is told most acceptably.\" One\r\nof Amanda Douglas's tales is spoken of as \"A story with a fine moral\r\ninfluence, yet not preachy, in the end leaving in the reader's mind the\r\nsense of having been in good company.\" (_Independent_, Dec. 15, 1898.)\r\n\r\nOne notice of \"Elsie on the Hudson\" is: \"The multitude of young people\r\nwho have read the Elsie books, by Martha Finley, will eagerly welcome\r\nthis volume by the same author. It has to do with American history in\r\nthe days of the Revolutionary war, and the style is simple and\r\npleasing.\" In another: \"Miss Martha Finley continues also the\r\ninstruction which is mixed up with that young woman's experiences.\"\r\n(_Dial_, Dec. 6, 1898.)\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, the same periodical, though I have not been able to\r\nverify the quotation, which commends Harry Steele Morrison's \"Yankee\r\nboy's success\" thus: \"The book is interesting, full of push and go. Boys\r\nwill read it with a gusto; yet they must remember that what this lucky\r\nYankee boy did is not what they all can do.\" Another number which puts a\r\njust estimate on Master Morrison as a \"very unlovely and unpleasant sort\r\nof boy, whose impudence and enterprise ought later to fit him for a\r\nplace on a yellow journal,\" entirely mistakes the purpose of Pugh's\r\n\"Tony Drum,\" a realistic story of London slum life, and classes it as a\r\nbook for boys. (_Dial_, Dec. 16, 1898.)\r\n\r\nThe _Outlook_ says of Frances Hodgson Burnett's mawkish \"Editha's\r\nburglar,\" which was well parodied in _Punch_ by Anstey in his \"Burglar\r\nBill\": \"This story of the queer, loving little girl and her daring and\r\nsuccessful effort to protect her mother, and the equally queer burglar,\r\nis too well known in play and story to need comment.\" (Dec. 10, 1898.)\r\nThis story is in almost all library and school lists, even the best\r\nselected and classified. The same number calls \"Mr. Van Vere\" \"a\r\ncharming story.\" (The adjective is used for four different works for\r\nyoung people in that week's grist.)\r\n\r\nEven Noah Brooks, in a signed article in the _Bookbuyer_ (Dec., 1898),\r\ngives praise to Drysdale and Stratemeyer, commends the uninteresting\r\nChilhowee books, refers to Pansy's as \"strong and helpful,\" and one of\r\nAmanda Douglas's as \"rich in chastened and refined sentiment.\" He\r\nmentions Oliver P. Tunk's \"Awful alphabet\" as \"a fit companion for 'A\r\ncoon alphabet.'\" Perhaps it is, but when libraries and schools are\r\ncirculating Jane Andrews's \"Seven little sisters\" to teach the\r\nbrotherhood and sisterhood of all nations, and teachers, in the language\r\nof Professor Thurston, of the Chicago Normal School, are \"encouraging\r\neach nationality to contribute the best it has of song, story, game,\r\nhome customs and occupations to the life of the school,\" it is wrong to\r\nbuy a book for a white child in which black children are held up to\r\nridicule, as they have been many times in _Harper's Young People_.\r\n\"Blackberries\" and \"Comical Coons\" are also recommended in the _Dial_\r\n(Dec. 16, 1897), where Gertrude Smith's \"Ten little comedies,\" a book\r\nentirely different in spirit from her \"Arabella and Araminta\" stories;\r\nMarion Harland's \"Old-field school girl,\" which has a story of horrible\r\ncruelty of a schoolmaster to a child, and is not meant for children; the\r\nsilly \"Elaine\" book, and the equally silly and sometimes coarse \"Father\r\nGoose\" are favorably reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe _Nation's_ reviews of children books have lately not been up to the\r\nold standard, as for instance a review of Sydney Reid's would-be funny\r\n\"Josey and the chipmunk\" (Dec. 13, 1900), which is called \"a perfectly\r\ndelightful child's book, nearly as good as the 'Alice' books, and,\r\nindeed, might be pronounced quite as good if Lewis Carroll, like\r\nShakespeare, had not 'thought of it first.'\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by these instances that reviews help children's\r\nlibrarians very little, and that it is impossible under present\r\nconditions for a library to determine the worth of a book without seeing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n2. There have been in the last 25 years many lists of children's books\r\nby libraries, schools, denominational societies and other organizations.\r\nThe earlier lists, although interesting to a student of the evolution of\r\nthe Children's Section, have so many books out of print or superseded\r\nthat they do not concern us now, except in that they are not made for\r\nvery young children, and often have a profusion of material which is\r\nover the heads of boys and girls below, or even in, the high school age.\r\nSome of them are made from hearsay or from other book lists, without an\r\nintimate knowledge, or indeed any knowledge at all, of books\r\nrecommended, as in the following instance: A paper read at a library\r\nmeeting and afterward printed in the report of a state librarian\r\ndescribes the \"library ladder\" as \"a list of books beginning with a tale\r\nof adventure. From this the reader's attention will be drawn to the next\r\nin order, leading on and out, until finally the child will be\r\nunconsciously delving into the mysteries of science; for example, we\r\ncould first take Butterworth's Indian story, 'The wampum belt': next,\r\nBrooks's 'Story of the American Indian'; from this lead to Bancroft's\r\n'Native races,' and finally various United States histories.\"\r\n\r\nAny one who has ever seen the five ponderous volumes of Bancroft's\r\n\"Native races of the Pacific States\" knows that although it has some\r\nvalue as a work of reference, not as a history, for older readers, it is\r\nentirely useless as a stepping-stone for children, who can easily go\r\nwithout its aid from Brooks's, or better, Grinnell's \"Story of the\r\nIndian\" to a good one-volume United States history, or even to John\r\nFiske or Parkman. It is no more meant for boys and girls than the other\r\nthirty-four volumes on the history of the Pacific coast completed by\r\nBancroft and his corps of assistants.\r\n\r\nSome tests of a library or school list are: Are the books in it chosen\r\nfor their permanent value? Has the maker of the list read them? Will it\r\ntell an overworked teacher or librarian what the best modern\r\nstraightforward stories in simple English are, the best life of\r\nLafayette without any long words like \"evacuation,\" or the best account\r\nof a salamander in language that a child of 10 can understand? A list\r\nfor teachers is not a help in choosing books for children, unless from\r\nthe point of view of child-study, which has another place than on the\r\nshelves of a children's room.\r\n\r\nIn one list the \"Dotty Dimple\" and \"Flaxie Frizzle\" books are\r\nrecommended for the third-reader grade. Children who are in this grade\r\ncannot read the ungrammatical baby-talk easily, and if they could it\r\nwould demoralize their English.\r\n\r\nAnother has for the seventh grade a part of the \"Library of wonders,\"\r\ntranslated from the French, and out of date 20 years ago. Teachers\r\nshould be careful in buying books of popular science that they are\r\nmodern, and also written in a style that makes them attractive to boys\r\nand girls. In a long experience in libraries I have never found that\r\nboys and girls liked the \"Library of wonders.\"\r\n\r\nA third, for children under 10 years of age, includes Miss Plympton's\r\n\"Dear daughter Dorothy,\" and even in one of the best and most recent\r\ngraded lists it is annotated as a \"story of devotion and comradeship\r\nbetween a father and his young daughter.\" Now \"Dear daughter Dorothy\" is\r\nthe best specimen I have ever seen of a kind of book to be kept out of\r\nlibraries and homes, the story of a little eight-year-old girl, who has\r\nthe entire control of the $1200 earned yearly by her father, a\r\nbookkeeper with literary aspirations. He is arrested on a charge of\r\nembezzlement, found guilty in the face of his daughter's testimony, but\r\nat last acquitted through the confession of the real criminal, and he\r\nand that important little personage, Dorothy, who takes all hearts by\r\nstorm, sail for England escorted to the ship by a crowd of admiring\r\nfriends, including the judge who sentenced him.\r\n\r\nThe next list has Mrs. Burnett's \"Little Saint Elizabeth,\" a morbid\r\ntale, and with it a reproduction of \"Prince Fairyfoot,\" a story which\r\nthe author read when she was a child in a book that she never could find\r\nagain. In order to understand the pertness and flippancy of her style in\r\nthis story, one has only to compare it with the original, reprinted\r\nwithin a few months in Frances Browne's \"Wonderful chair,\" or \"Granny's\r\nwonderful chair,\" as it is called in one edition. A few lines in the\r\nsimple, direct English of the old fairy tales, are expanded by Mrs.\r\nBurnett into eight or 10 pages, with attempts at wit and allusions to\r\nunhappy married life, which should be kept out of books for children.\r\n\r\nThe same article in the _Nation_ which gives high praise to \"Josey and\r\nthe chipmunk\" thinks \"The wonderful chair\" prosy, but I have tested it\r\non children who do not enjoy stories unless they are simply told, and\r\nhave found that it holds their attention.\r\n\r\nBooks on differences of religious belief, books written in a style or on\r\nsubjects beyond the years of boys and girls, scientific books that are\r\ninaccurate or out of date, books that make children despise their\r\nelders, or have an overweening sense of their own importance, and books\r\nthat are cheap, slangy, flippant, or written in bad English, dialect or\r\nbaby-talk, should have no place in a school list, and books on poor\r\npaper and in poor type and binding should also be kept out. There are\r\nbooks that tell stories of wholesome, well-bred children; fairy tales in\r\nthe simple, old-fashioned style; out-of-door books that are not dull or\r\naggressively instructive; and selections from the best poetry to choose\r\nfrom. There is room yet for the right kind of histories that are\r\ninteresting without being babyish, and accurate without being dull.\r\n\r\nLists are often made in entire ignorance of the limitations of the\r\nchildren who are to use the books recommended in them. A\r\nwell-intentioned paper suggests for children of eight or over Ebers'\r\n\"Uarda\" and Thiers' \"French Revolution\" as attractive historical works.\r\nIn science it mentions Hooker's books, which are quite out of date, and\r\nin biography Lockhart's Scott and Forster's Dickens, which not one boy\r\nor girl in a hundred would read through, great as is their charm.\r\nBryce's \"American commonwealth\" is also named. This list has either been\r\nmade up from books that the compiler has heard of as classics, or else\r\nshe is not in the habit of associating on familiar terms with boys and\r\ngirls, even of high school age. This paper recommends Sophie May for\r\nvery young children, and also the \"Story of liberty,\" which a mother in\r\nthe New York _Times_ says is in the library of her daughter of eight.\r\nThis is a mother who would not allow a child to read Scott's novels till\r\n14 or 15, and thinks Dickens too sad for even that age!\r\n\r\nThe hundred books recommended in the _St. Nicholas_ for March, 1900,\r\nmade up from many competing lists, are nearly all good. A few, like Mrs.\r\nRichards' \"Captain January,\" Mrs. Wiggin's \"The Birds' Christmas Carol,\"\r\nand Munroe's \"Through swamp and glade\" have no permanent value. If one\r\nof Munroe's books is to be included it should be \"The flamingo feather,\"\r\nor \"Derrick Sterling,\" both of which are well worth reading many times\r\nand are great favorites with children. The defect in the list is the\r\nsame just spoken of, that too many of the books are for boys and girls\r\nfrom 10 to 14 years old of bookish families, and that little attention\r\nis paid to younger or less carefully trained children.\r\n\r\nOne list puts into the first primary grade, or fourth year of school,\r\nfor children nine or 10 years old, Abbott's \"Cyrus,\" \"Darius,\" \"Xerxes,\"\r\nand other heroes, and Fiske's \"War of independence,\" all of which are\r\nentirely beyond the grasp of 499 children out of 500 under 12 or 14.\r\nLists should be shorter, and not too closely divided. A division, \"Easy\r\nbooks,\" should include whatever children need until they can read\r\nwithout difficulty, and should contain books like Longman's adapted\r\nstories from the \"Blue fairy book\" and the earlier volumes of the \"Ship\"\r\nEnglish history, Baldwin's \"Fifty famous stories retold\" and\r\nEggleston's \"Great Americans for little Americans.\"\r\n\r\nIn one case where books are not classified by grade, Horace Bushnell's\r\n\"Woman suffrage,\" Hinsdale's \"President Garfield and education,\" and\r\nWright's \"Industrial evolution of the United States\" are in the same\r\nclass with Emilie Poulsson's \"Through the farmyard gate,\" with no\r\ndiscrimination as to the age for which any one of the four is intended.\r\nThree are beyond the understanding of boys and girls below high school\r\nage, and if in school libraries should be for teachers only, and the\r\nfourth is a book of kindergarten stories.\r\n\r\nA book which is often commended by teachers and librarians is Coffin's\r\n\"Story of liberty,\" which I said nearly 20 years ago \"is so fierce in\r\nits Protestantism and so bloody in its details that it causes pain to\r\nmany a sensitive child.\" The pictures are too horrible for a child to\r\nsee, and the book, like any other which wars against any form of\r\nreligious belief, should not be allowed in a public school.\r\n\r\nSome lists admit the \"Elsie\" books, tearfully sentimental and priggish,\r\nwhere the heroine is held up as a saint and martyr for refusing to obey\r\nan entirely reasonable request of her father, and where money, fine\r\nclothes, and love-making at an early age hold too prominent a place.\r\n\r\nIn one list, one of Mayne Reid's books is annotated, \"To read carefully\r\nany volume of this author is to acquire a considerable knowledge of the\r\ntrees, the flowers, the animals, the insects, and the human creatures\r\nexisting in the region where the story takes place.\" In Mayne Reid's\r\n\"Desert home\" maple sugar trees are tapped in the autumn and yield\r\nnearly a hundred pounds of sugar. Emerson's \"Trees and shrubs of\r\nMassachusetts\" states that although sap will flow in summer and early\r\nautumn, it has but little saccharine matter. Mayne Reid's stories as\r\nstories are delightful for children to read, but should never be used as\r\naids to geography lessons.\r\n\r\nOne library offers its boy-and-girl readers Bushnell's \"Moral uses of\r\ndark things,\" Mrs. Campbell's \"Problems of poverty,\" Ely's \"Labor\r\nmovement in America\" and Shinn's \"Mining camps.\"\r\n\r\nThe lists made by James M. Sawin, of Providence, are good and\r\nsuggestive, but better for older than younger children, including,\r\nhowever, for beginners in reading some excellent old favorites like Mrs.\r\nFollen's \"Twilight stories,\" and for children a little older a book that\r\nought to be in print, Paul de Musset's \"Mr. Wind and Madam Rain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Milwaukee list for children under 10 is good for the most part, but\r\nincludes \"Dear daughter Dorothy\" and \"Editha's burglar.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitney's list of \"Books not usually selected by young people\"\r\n(first published in the _Bulletin of Bibliography_) is for the most part\r\nbeyond the grammar-school age, including such books as Sismondi's\r\n\"Literature of the south of Europe\" and Ragozin's \"Vedic India.\" It is\r\nunclassified, good and not too American.\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo Public Library lists are the best that I have found,\r\nthoroughly practical, well chosen, and in the pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Classroom libraries for public schools\" well graded as far as one can\r\njudge. The grading of schools varies so much in different cities that it\r\nis impossible unless one knows exactly what \"four\" or \"eight\" or \"nine\"\r\nrepresents to say whether books are suitable for it. A list of this kind\r\ncannot be made without a thorough understanding between librarian and\r\nteachers, a thorough knowledge of the condition of the schools and the\r\nhome-life of the children on the part of the librarian, and a knowledge\r\nof books on the part of the teachers.\r\n\r\nThe graded and annotated list from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh is\r\nfor teachers, not children, and has many suggestive notes, but will bear\r\nweeding.\r\n\r\nMany lists are almost entirely American, and seem at first sight narrow\r\nand one-sided. A little thought and knowledge of the conditions under\r\nwhich they are made shows the cause of this apparent fault. City lists\r\nare made for schools which are full of children of newly-arrived\r\nemigrants, whose first desire, as soon as they can read English at all,\r\nis to know something of the great free country to which they have come.\r\nIt is to supply this demand that many simple United States histories and\r\nhistorical stories relating to this country have been put upon the\r\nmarket in the last five years, almost to the exclusion of other books of\r\nthe kind. Teachers and librarians should remember in making lists that\r\nthere are other countries in the world, and good histories of them, like\r\nLongmans' \"Ship\" series.\r\n\r\nThe books suggested by public library commissions are usually published\r\nin this country, partly for the reasons that it is easier to find them,\r\nthat they are cheaper than imported books, and that they are in demand\r\nin small libraries. The New York State Library lists are of this kind,\r\nand the books for children are carefully chosen as far as they can be\r\nfrom this country alone.\r\n\r\nWith regard to scientific books for children, the Springfield (Mass.)\r\nCity Library has printed a short list of books on science and useful\r\narts that children really enjoy. This list has been prepared by the\r\nchildren's librarian in connection with the supervisor of science in the\r\nSpringfield public schools and an out-of-town librarian. The list is the\r\nbest I have seen, but is open to criticism on account of one or two of\r\nthe books being out of date. The list for third-grade teachers compiled\r\nby Miss May H. Prentice for the Cleveland Library is excellent for\r\nsupplementary reading and nature-stories and poems.\r\n\r\n3. The value of articles on children's reading is variable, but a fair\r\nspecimen may be found in the _Contemporary Review_ for June, where H. V.\r\nWeisse states in his \"Reading for the young\" that a generation ago the\r\nnumber of published books was small, magazines were high in tone, and in\r\nthe realm of juvenile literature Ballantyne was \"monarch of all he\r\nsurveyed.\" On account of the limited supply of children's books, boys\r\nand girls were thus driven to standard authors. \"Now magazines and\r\nso-called 'historical stories' are issued in such quantities that young\r\npeople read nothing else. They should be trained to better things, and\r\nteachers and mothers should read to their children and see that they\r\nread good books for themselves, if need be rewarding for a clear\r\nreproduction of the sense of any good book, never punishing for a\r\nfailure to understand, at first hearing or reading, that which involves\r\n'a new form of mental effort.'\" We have all heard something like this\r\nbefore! Even Agnes Repplier, with her charm of style and her\r\ndenunciation of the \"little Pharisee in fiction,\" and the too-important\r\nRose in Bloom in contrast to the well-kept-under Rosamond, makes few\r\nsuggestions of books which are good for children to read.\r\n\r\nThe reading lists in the New York _Times_ are based on the experience of\r\nthe writers, who have often been precocious, over-stimulated children of\r\nbookish families without companions of their own age, and have no idea\r\nof the needs, wants and limitations of the public library children of\r\nto-day, many of whom have few or no books at home. \"I have quite a\r\nlibrary,\" wrote one such child. \"I have three books, Longfellow's poems,\r\na geography, and a book of fairy tales.\"\r\n\r\nA dreamy boy like \"The child in the library\" of a recent _Atlantic\r\nMonthly_ and the keen little newsboy who snatches a half hour after\r\nschool is over and he has sold his papers to spell out a simple life of\r\nColumbus or the \"Story of the chosen people\" have little in common, and\r\nneed different books, but they both need the very best of their kind.\r\n\r\nA book reviewer or maker of book lists for children should have an\r\nintimate knowledge of the best books which have been written for them,\r\nand the unconscious training which this knowledge gives in good taste\r\nand a critical sense of style. He (or she) should have also the intimate\r\nknowledge of all sorts and conditions of children and their limitations\r\nthat a teacher or a settlement worker or a wise mother has. More than 20\r\nyears ago, in the meeting of the American Library Association in Boston,\r\nMrs. Kate Gannett Wells said: \"I would like to have mothers prepare\r\nlists, whose headings should vary from any yet given; such as: books\r\nthat make children cry; books of adventure for unexcitable and\r\nunimaginative children; unlovesick novels.\"\r\n\r\nThe best reviews of children's books ever written in this country were\r\nthe work of a woman and a mother--Lucy McKim Garrison, who, in the\r\nearlier volumes of the _Nation_, put into her work broad-mindedness,\r\nhigh ideals, and an understanding of children. It is such work as this\r\nthat should be a model for the reviewers and a guide to the librarians\r\nof to-day, and one of the most important duties of the Children's\r\nSection is to insist upon higher standards, both in reviewers and\r\nthrough them in the writers of children's books, and upon trained\r\ncritical knowledge in the makers of children's lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BOOKS FOR CHILDREN:\r\n\r\n               I. FICTION, II. FAIRY TALES, III. SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been fairly demonstrated that we have as yet no proper\r\nstandard of values to guide us in the selection of children's books.\r\nReviews fail: they either do not evaluate the book at all, or they lack\r\nappreciation of it or of the children who are to read it--or both. Book\r\nlists fail, as a rule, through eagerness to get something printed before\r\nwe know what to print. Articles upon children's reading fail because the\r\npeople who have written them are not always familiar with children's\r\nbooks or are not acquainted with the \"public library child.\" We turn to\r\nthe books themselves, but, having no standard of values, how shall we\r\njudge? How are we to know whether a book is good or poor?\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to reduce the appreciation of literature--whether\r\nbooks for children or for all time--to an exact science. It is difficult\r\nto conceive of any formula for the evaluation of books in general or the\r\nbooks of a particular class which would not fail again and again when\r\napplied to the individual book through the medium of a personal\r\njudgment. We shall not attempt, therefore, to answer the questions which\r\nform the substance of our topic. We have endeavored merely to state a\r\nquestion which to all children's librarians seems to be of paramount\r\nimportance, trusting that we may eventually reach a partial solution of\r\nthis problem by bringing the thought of many minds to bear upon it.\r\n\r\nThis collective paper, or, more properly, this collection of ideas upon\r\ndifferent classes of books, requires a word of explanation. The\r\ncontributors were not asked to prepare papers but to furnish ideas and\r\nopinions, which should form the basis for discussion of the general\r\nprinciples of selection and of individual books in the several classes\r\nconsidered. The purpose was to present briefly the principles that\r\nshould apply in each class, and to emphasize these by citation of\r\nspecific books.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _I. FICTION._\r\n\r\nWe were recently asked to make out a list of a dozen books suitable as\r\nprizes for a Sunday-school class of boys and girls from 12 to 16 years\r\nof age. We studied a long and carefully prepared list of stories written\r\nfor girls of this age and supposed to include what was most desirable.\r\nAssuming that the girls had read Mrs. Whitney and Miss Alcott, we did\r\nnot consider them, and we found not one story which we could recommend\r\nas possessing permanent interest and literary value. There were many\r\nbooks which girls read and like but they did not reach a fair standard\r\nfor this purpose. We filled out the desired number for the girls with\r\nbooks written for older readers. Far different was our experience with\r\nthe books for the boys. It was only a matter of choice between a large\r\nnumber, both suitable and desirable, and yet the lists which we\r\nconsulted had been compiled by the same hand.\r\n\r\nIn making selections of books for her readers, the children's librarian\r\nencounters at the first step this difference in the quality of the books\r\nwritten for boys and those written for girls. Judged purely by the\r\nstandard of taste, she must reject the greater proportion of those\r\nwritten for girls. When she finds so few that reach her standard she may\r\nblame herself for ignorance of the better books, but she must ultimately\r\nreach the conclusion that whatever her own shortcomings there is a lack\r\nof desirable books for girls. However, another most important factor\r\ncomes into the case on the reader's side of the question. If the\r\nlibrarian is going to meet the needs of her readers she must understand\r\nwhat they are instinctively seeking in books, and she must enlist\r\nherself on the side of human nature. She will find at once that a\r\ndistinct division in the reading of boys and girls springs from the fact\r\nthat, generally speaking, the mental life of the boy is objective, that\r\nof the girl subjective. The boy seeks action in fiction, the girl is\r\nattracted by that which moves her emotionally or relates itself directly\r\nto her own consciousness, and the last thing that either of them cares\r\nabout is the literary value of the book. Hundreds--no doubt\r\nthousands--of our college graduates look back to the period when,\r\naccording to their sex, the \"Oliver Optic\" series, or the \"Elsie\r\nDinsmore\" series, played a very important part in their existence. The\r\nlove of adventure in the boy gave the charm to the books. Adventure he\r\nmust have, whether he finds it in the tinsel setting of Oliver Optic or\r\nthe refined gold of Robert Louis Stevenson. And the magnet in the nature\r\nof the girl draws to herself something helpful even from Martha Finley;\r\notherwise, she would not speak of the \"Elsie\" books as \"beautiful\":\r\nthere is something in them which to her represents \"beauty.\"\r\nNevertheless, while justly condemning the Oliver Optic and the Elsie\r\nbooks as cheap, tawdry things, the librarian must seek among better\r\nauthors the holding quality on the nature of the child which these books\r\npossess. She must search for books in which these elements of interest\r\nare incarnated in what we call literature--books which, while rivalling\r\nthese in attraction, will at the same time refine and broaden the taste\r\nof the reader.\r\n\r\nNow, the lovers of Oliver Optic and Mrs. Finley do not take kindly to\r\nthe classics and as, in the modern stories for young people, few will\r\npass muster as literature, all that the librarian of to-day can do is to\r\nuse her judgment and discrimination among those the writers have\r\nprovided. The boys are readily turned from Oliver Optic to Henty,\r\nTomlinson, Jules Verne, and on to \"Ivanhoe,\" but with the girls the case\r\nis hard. The girl tells us that she likes stories about boarding-school.\r\nIt is a capital subject: in the hands of a writer sympathetic with\r\ngirls, of fertile imagination and vigorous power of characterization,\r\nboarding-school life affords material for most entertaining\r\ncombinations--but the literature of the boarding-school has yet to be\r\nwritten. The average boarding-school story has three main\r\ncharacters--the attractive, impulsive heroine, always getting into\r\ntrouble; the cruel, cold-blooded, unscrupulous rival, habitually dealing\r\nin falsehood, and the teacher who is singularly devoid of discernment or\r\nintuition. The heroine inevitably falls into the snare of the rival, and\r\nthings are usually set right all around by a death-bed scene--although\r\nactual death is sometimes averted. \"Louie's last term at St. Mary's\" is\r\none of the better stories of this kind, and Mrs. Spofford's \"Hester\r\nStanley at St. Mark's\" is fairly well written, with a touch of the charm\r\nof the author's personality. \"Chums,\" by Maria Louise Pool, is one of\r\nthe worst of its kind, where envy, hatred, and malice run riot through\r\nthe pages and the actors in the story are wholly lacking in vitality.\r\nThe experiences of Miss Phelps's \"Gypsy Breynton\" and Susan Coolidge's\r\n\"Katy\" are as satisfactory pictures of boarding school life as we have;\r\nand Helen Dawes Brown's \"Two college girls\" is a good story. \"Brenda,\r\nher school and her club,\" by Helen L. Reed, is a recent valuable\r\naddition to books for girls.\r\n\r\nIn stories of home life Miss Alcott still easily takes the lead, with\r\nSusan Coolidge and Sophie May following in merit and popularity. The\r\nboys have an excellent story of home life in Rossiter Johnson's \"Phaeton\r\nRogers.\" The setting is perfectly simple, every day surroundings, but\r\nthe characters have the abounding vitality that keeps things moving. The\r\nentertaining succession of events proceeds directly and naturally from\r\nthe ingenuity and healthy activity of the young people grouped together.\r\nThe book is a model in this respect as well as in the use of colloquial\r\nEnglish which never loses a certain refinement. Every boy, while reading\r\n\"Phaeton Rogers,\" finds himself in touch with good companions--and this\r\nis true as well, in Charles Talbot's books for boys and girls.\r\n\r\nThe most important books for boys are the historical stories, appealing\r\nat once to the hero worship and the love of adventure common to boyhood;\r\nat the same time they should give a good general idea of history. The\r\nstory in historical setting is, also, most desirable for girls--in that\r\nit balances the too subjective tendency; it carries the mind of the\r\nreader beyond the emotional condition of the heroine--indeed the heroine\r\nhas no time to study her own emotions when brought into vital relation\r\nwith stirring events. Apart from the value of the historical facts\r\nimparted is the indirect but more valuable habit of mind cultivated in\r\nthe girl reader. Vivid, stirring, absorbing stories for girls can be and\r\nshould be written in this field, which is practically unlimited. Miss\r\nYonge has done some good service here. \"The prince and the pauper\" and\r\nthe \"Last days of Pompeii\" are also illustrations of the kind of work\r\nthat should be done--they are both strong in the direct interrelation\r\nbetween the imaginary characters and real history--and both appeal alike\r\nto the boy and the girl.\r\n\r\nBooks written with a direct moral purpose seldom achieve popularity with\r\nboys--and yet one of the most popular of all their books is \"Captains\r\ncourageous,\" which is of the highest moral value though without one line\r\nof religious preaching in its pages. Here the boys are in touch with a\r\nreal, living character, acted upon and developed, through the moulding\r\npressure of life itself--from first to last the aim of the story is the\r\nboy; and yet the moral outcome is simple, natural, inevitable and manly;\r\nit appeals to the common sense which is strong in boys.\r\n\r\nNow when a woman writes for girls on the subject of the transformation\r\nof a frivolous butterfly into a girl of sense, instead of giving us\r\ncharacter and action with a moral outcome, we have a religious setting\r\nwith the action of the story and the conduct of the characters bent in\r\nevery direction to illustrate the motive of the story--the religious\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nThe plastic nature of the young girl wrought upon by life, fresh\r\nfaculties brought into activity by the hard knocks of fate or the\r\nsunbursts of good luck--although these things are happening every day in\r\nthe real life of young girls, we yet await the writer who will put them\r\ninto literature without sentimentalizing. What we want is the novel\r\nsimplified; the story told directly, without byways of description or\r\nanalysis; where healthy young people, neither saints nor prigs, nor\r\ncreatures of affectation, jealousy, or malice, are acted upon by life\r\nand each other in a natural fashion.\r\n\r\nLet boys and girls be brought together as in real life; brothers are a\r\ngood element in girls' stories, and love affairs need not be excluded,\r\nif handled with delicacy, common sense and true feeling. Many books\r\nclassed as novels are merely stories simply and clearly told, intended\r\nfor older readers, but far better for young girls than the stories\r\nusually written for them. Miss Jeanie Gould Lincoln's stories and Mrs.\r\nJ. G. Austin's historical novels, some of Mrs. Barr's and Mrs.\r\nOliphant's novels and a wide range of other interesting, well-told\r\nstories can be substituted, if care and discrimination are used in the\r\nselection. Fortunately, too, many girls of twelve are ready for Dickens\r\nand other standard writers.\r\n\r\nHowever it is not only through the emotions that these aspirations and\r\ndesires are ministered to--when the writer can develop this emotion into\r\nspiritual enthusiasm--or when she portrays a character of active\r\nspiritual force, she has put something valuable into the life of the\r\nreader. Here, as always, it is the personality of the writer--the soul\r\nback of the words that most counts, and it is just this quality of true\r\nspirituality which gives value to Mrs. Whitney's stories, in spite of\r\ntheir wordiness, lack of proportion and forced symbolism; as it is the\r\ngenuine goodness and pure idealism of Miss Mulock which forms the very\r\natmosphere in which her characters move.\r\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to offer a practical guide to the selection of\r\nbooks a few suggestions can be made. In the religious stories, for\r\ninstance, there must be discrimination between those encouraging morbid\r\nself-examination or religious sentimentalizing, and those cultivating\r\noptimism and the perception of true values and ideals.\r\n\r\nIn books of adventure the dividing line would fall between, on the one\r\nside, those stories where the hero is actuated by pure love of adventure\r\nor where the adventure is worth while in itself--as in \"Foul play\"; and,\r\non the other side, those stories where the hero is merely seeking to\r\nexploit himself and in which the tendency might be to incite boys to\r\nreckless escapades for the sake of notoriety.\r\n\r\nIn the _purchase_ of books one must consider the range of the average\r\nreader, but in _recommending_ books to the individual boy and girl,\r\nappreciation of differences in temperament and culture is indispensable.\r\n\r\n                                                WINIFRED L. TAYLOR,\r\n                         _Pratt Institute Free Library, Brooklyn, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _II. FAIRY TALES._\r\n\r\nFairy tales must appeal to the love of the marvellous, and must yet be\r\ntold with a simplicity that precludes all doubt of their reality in the\r\nmind of the child, no matter how improbable the circumstances to our\r\nprosaic minds. The language must be simple and dignified. To write a\r\nfairy tale, one must first of all be a poet, at least must have the\r\npoetic instinct. The child very early absorbs the idea of rhyme. He is\r\nsung to sleep with cradle songs, and soothed by jingles, and he does not\r\nsoon outgrow their influence.\r\n\r\nThese tales from the librarian's standpoint, fall naturally into two\r\nclasses: the folklore legends adapted for children (in which, regardless\r\nof classification, we include mythological tales) and the purely\r\nliterary, imaginative story.\r\n\r\n                 _Fairy tales derived from folk-lore._\r\n\r\nFairy tales derived from folk-lore--stories drifted down from the\r\nchildhood of the world, were not originally written for children, and\r\nperhaps for this very reason, they have claimed them for their own. They\r\nare not \"the artless appeals to all little masters and misses who are\r\ngood or intend to be good\" of John Newbery's time. They have a\r\nnaturalness which these first books printed especially for children\r\nlack; the moral is not too strongly urged. Different versions of the\r\nold, old tales reflect in a measure the manners and customs of the\r\ncountry in which they are collected. Fairies are stolid or clever,\r\nmischievous or amiable, according to the characters of the people to\r\nwhom the stories were told.\r\n\r\nTo this class belong the Grimm brothers' \"Household tales,\" \"Icelandic\r\ntales,\" edited by Mrs. A. W. Hall (tales in which it is the princess or\r\nthe peasant maiden who rescues the prince, instead of being rescued);\r\nthe Norwegian tales of Asbjörnsen and Moë, the Grimm brothers of the far\r\nNorth. The collections of Lang, Baring-Gould; and Cruikshank, because of\r\nillustrations; Miss Mulock's \"Book of fairies\" and William Canton's\r\n\"True annals of fairyland\" should be in all libraries.\r\n\r\nCollections of tales derived from Greek and Roman mythology, such as\r\nKingsley's \"Heroes,\" Hawthorne's \"Wonder book\" and \"Tanglewood tales,\"\r\nmay also be considered as fairy tales derived from folk-lore.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exquisitely told of the old Greek fairy tales is that of\r\n\"Eros and Psyche,\" adapted by Paul Carus from Apuleius. The story\r\nappeals to children, regardless of the religious significance indicated\r\nin the preface of the book.\r\n\r\n\"Fairy tales from far Japan,\" translated by Susan Ballard, is excellent,\r\nparticularly the story of the \"Magic mirror,\" which is also found in a\r\ncharming set of booklets published in Tokio, in English. This set is\r\ncalled the \"Japanese fairy tale series,\" the type, paper and colored\r\nillustrations being all of Japanese manufacture.\r\n\r\n\"Fairy stories from the little mountain,\" by John Finnemore, is a good\r\ncollection of Welsh stories as is Frere's \"Old Deccan days\" of Indian\r\nfolk-lore.\r\n\r\n\"Wigwam stories,\" edited by Mary Catherine Judd, are told by Indians, or\r\nadapted from ethnological reports and original sources.\r\n\r\nMabie's \"Norse stories retold from the Eddas,\" Keary's \"Heroes of\r\nAsgard,\" \"The wonder-world stories\" of Marie Pabke and Margery Deane,\r\nScudder's \"Book of folk tales\" and Wiltse's \"Folk-lore and proverb\r\nstories,\" both of the latter for the youngest readers, the Countess\r\nd'Aulnoy's fairy tales, the collections of Laboulaye and the immortal\r\ntales of Perrault, we cannot afford to be without, as well as Howard\r\nPyle's \"Wonder clock\" and \"Pepper and salt,\" which retain the old-time\r\nflavor and are much enhanced by the author's illustrations.\r\n\r\n                        _Literary fairy tales._\r\n\r\nHans Christian Andersen's stories, while based often upon tradition, are\r\nexcluded by Hartland from the list of pure fairy tales and classed as\r\nliterary. Yet even the old, old fairy tales cannot, with justice, rival\r\nhis in the hearts of the children. Their feeling for him has been\r\nexpressed by John White Chadwick, in writing of another:\r\n\r\n  \"But as I muse, I seem at heaven's door\r\n  To hear a sound which there I heard before.\r\n  When Danish Hans that way did softly wend--\r\n  A sound of children making merriest din\r\n  Of welcome, as the old man entered in.\"\r\n\r\nMary S. Claude, in \"Twilight thoughts,\" has shown herself a graceful\r\nfollower in the footsteps of Andersen. Such stories create a tenderness\r\nfor plants and animals not easily effaced.\r\n\r\nIt detracts nothing from the interest of the story that what a child\r\ncalls a fairy tale we call literature. Even Dr. Johnson recognized that\r\n\"babies do not want to hear about babies.\" It is a great pity that a\r\nchild should never meet the knights of the Round Table, or the\r\nCharlemagne legends--half history, half romance--or the Homeric tales,\r\noutside the dissecting room of a literature class. Small wonder that a\r\nchild who heard them there for the first time should exclaim with\r\nconsiderable animus, \"I like to read, but I hate literature.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a good field for the \"story hour\" so successfully introduced in\r\nthe Carnegie Library, Pittsburgh. That edition which follows most\r\nclosely the original, or is told in graphic clear-cut English, such as\r\nMorris uses in the \"Earthly paradise\" or the \"Life and death of Jason,\"\r\nor Butcher and Lang's translation of the Odyssey, is the best. Such a\r\nversion read aloud is infinitely better than the best dilution by any\r\nwell-meaning attendant. Skip judiciously, but do not weaken the story.\r\nIt is not only the plot but the charm of style which we wish to\r\nintroduce. The argument may of course first be given, that the child be\r\nput in sympathy with the situation.\r\n\r\n                         _Modern fairy tales._\r\n\r\nA good modern fairy tale is a rare article. One may search far and long\r\nbefore finding it. If it is not worth reading twice, it is not worth\r\nreading once. In many of these modern tales there is an atmosphere of\r\nhaste wholly lacking in the good old tales. Fairyland has a government\r\nof its own, where neither time nor space has value. It lies \"east of the\r\nsun and west of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the best collections is \"Granny's wonderful chair,\" by Frances\r\nBrowne--in the American edition \"The wonderful chair.\" It is well\r\nwritten, the interest is well kept up, and the language is befitting the\r\nsubject. The surest way to test a poor fairy tale is to first read one\r\nof unquestionable merit, and to get thoroughly into its atmosphere.\r\n\r\n                       _Good modern fairy tales._\r\n\r\n\"Princess Ilse,\" by Marie Petersen; a gracefully told story of a\r\ndiscontented mountain brook.\r\n\r\n\"Mopsa the fairy,\" by Jean Ingelow, and \"The little lame prince,\" by\r\nDinah Maria Craik.\r\n\r\n\"Lob-lie-by-the-fire,\" by Mrs. Ewing, and \"At the back of the North\r\nwind\" and \"The Princess and Curdie,\" by George Macdonald.\r\n\r\nThe average modern fairy tale is a jumble of impossibilities, with no\r\ncontinuity of incident, well enough or poorly written, according to the\r\nability of the writer.\r\n\r\n\"The magic fruit garden,\" by Marion Wallace Dunlop, is an illustration\r\nof this kind. Two very small children, in abbreviated pinafores, are\r\nstudying their Monday lessons; one is writing an essay on Perseverance,\r\nthe other is copying geographical names. By the illustrations, one may\r\njudge the children to be of kindergarten age. It is not surprising that\r\nthey fall asleep, and, to dreamland sent, meet with adventures enough to\r\nmake the strongest head whirl--a case of literary delirium tremens.\r\n\r\n\"Snow garden,\" by Elizabeth Wordsworth, is on the whole a good\r\ncollection; the stories, however, are of unequal merit.\r\n\r\n\"The other side of the sun,\" by Evelyn Sharp, is of negative goodness.\r\nThe witches and wizards are mild and amiable, especial care evidently\r\nbeing taken that no child should be kept awake at night. It does no harm\r\nfor children occasionally to shiver and shake as poor Hans in the Grimm\r\ncollection longed to do. The author's satisfaction at the expression the\r\n\"wymps wimpled\" is insisted upon a little too frequently.\r\n\r\n\"Fairy folk of Blue Hill,\" by Lily F. Wesselhoeft, is of especial\r\ninterest to children about Boston, since it accounts for the granite\r\nquarries and pudding stone of the region. It is smoothly written and is\r\nnot spoiled by slang or pertness.\r\n\r\n\"Summer legends,\" by Rudolph Baumbach. The stories are not altogether\r\nfairy tales nor are they written for the youngest readers. They are\r\ngracefully written although they lose somewhat by translation. The book\r\nis in some parts amusing and all the stories are peopled with the\r\nwonderful creatures of fairyland.\r\n\r\nOther tales seem invented only for the purpose of forcing religious\r\nsentiment, or pointing a moral in inverse proportion to the size of the\r\nreader. Their authors seem sometimes to have reached Mark Twain's\r\nconclusion that \"every one being born with an equal amount of original\r\nsin, the pressure on the square inch must needs be greater in a baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pixie and Elaine stories,\" by Carrie E. Morrison, is a mixture of fairy\r\ntale and religious story. The author speaks in her preface of the\r\nstories having been carefully pruned. One shudders at thinking what they\r\nmust have been before, with such chapters as \"The Elaines' picture of\r\nheaven,\" and \"The pixie transforms an Elaine\" left in.\r\n\r\n\"New book of the fairies,\" by Beatrice Harraden, is marred by the\r\nsuggestion of cruelty to animals. In one story, in place of rubbing the\r\nAladdin lamp, that what one wishes may happen, one must pull the black\r\ncat's tail. It is gratifying to reflect that black cats have their own\r\npeculiar method of retaliation for such experiments.\r\n\r\n                        _Burlesque fairy tales._\r\n\r\nBurlesque fairy tales are the most atrocious of all. They are apt to be\r\nbroad in their humor, full of _fin de siècle_ jokes or puns, and modern\r\nallusions which mar the poetry of the tale if there is any in it, and\r\ncreate an appetite for facetiousness in books. \"Lips wagging, and never\r\na wise word,\" one is tempted to say with Ben Jonson.... Copyright fees\r\nshould be trebled on this class of books.\r\n\r\nUnder this head come:\r\n\r\n\"The book of dragons,\" by E. Nesbit.\r\n\r\n\"Here they are!\" by James F. Sullivan; full of modern allusions and\r\npuns.\r\n\r\n\"The pink hen,\" by Cuthbert Sterling; a sort of \"continuous\r\nperformance.\" The pink hen is hatched from a forgotten Easter egg, is\r\ndriven from the barnyard by her associates and forced to seek her\r\nfortune. She links her fate with that of a little girl who has escaped\r\nfrom an ogre, and together they redeem a prince from the curses of bad\r\nfairies. The pink hen is continually punning, and the prince while still\r\nin the cradle is addicted to smoking.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to tell how the author of Jewett's \"More bunny stories\" would\r\nclassify them. We hope not as fairy tales. They are poor from any point\r\nof view. The bunnies might as well be ordinary children as anything.\r\nThey go to lawn parties, play golf, dance the Virginia reel, go to West\r\nPoint, tell folk-lore stories, repeat Bible verses and say their\r\nprayers. We are sometimes asked for a Sunday book. For one who must have\r\na special book for that day, this might possibly answer; it is certainly\r\nfull of moral reflections and pious sentiment; but there is no reason at\r\nall for reading it on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday. The story closes\r\nwith a wedding where the happy bunnies are united under a bridal bell,\r\nwhile the strains of the march from \"Lohengrin\" float in the air.\r\n\r\nHumor is not early developed in all children, which is perhaps why a\r\ngreat many do not care for \"Alice in Wonderland,\" and for Stockton's\r\nfairy tales--\"The bee man of Orn,\" \"The griffin and the minor canon,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nLaura E. Richards' \"Chop-chin and the golden dragon\" must also be\r\nclassed as humorous. It is not as good as the Toto stories.\r\n\r\n                          _Animal folk-lore._\r\n\r\nAnimal folk tales as exemplified in Joel Chandler Harris's stories,\r\n\"Little Mr. Thimble-finger,\" \"Mr. Rabbit at home,\" \"Daddy Jake,\" \"Uncle\r\nRemus,\" \"Story of Aaron,\" etc., are excellent. Brer Fox and Brer Rabbit,\r\nthe black stallion and all the animal characters are quite as much\r\nrealities to the children as Buster John, Sweetest Susan and the Little\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nOrtoli's \"Evening tales,\" follows the same general line.\r\n\r\nKipling, too, in the \"Jungle books\" has won the hearts of the children,\r\nand here there is no hint of the \"garlic flavor,\" mentioned by\r\nHigginson.\r\n\r\nFraser's \"Mooswa\" also belongs to this class.\r\n\r\nA common practice in modern fairy stories is for the author to open the\r\ntale in this way: A child falls asleep and enters fairyland via the\r\ndream country. Often the child has been sent to bed for some\r\nmisdemeanor, as in the \"Dream fox story book,\" by Mabel Osgood Wright,\r\nor has fallen asleep over his tasks, as in the case of the \"One-eyed\r\ngriffin,\" by Herbert E. Inman, the fairy tales being offered by way of\r\nconsolation; a reprehensible practice in itself, besides putting one out\r\nof touch with the real fairyland. It is too conspicuously \"make believe\"\r\nand leads one to suspect that the author has little confidence in his\r\nown production. As \"good wine needs no bush,\" so a good fairy tale needs\r\nno introduction or apology. In the real fairyland one cannot easily be\r\nungraceful.\r\n\r\n                         _Nature fairy tales._\r\n\r\nNature fairy tales are more than apt to be failures, and often include a\r\ngreat deal of pertness and cheap talk, in their effort to teach by\r\nstealth. (Charles Lamb writes to Coleridge in regard to Goody Two Shoes\r\nin this way: \"Think what you would have been now, if, instead of being\r\nfed with tales and old wives' fables, you had been crammed with\r\ngeography and natural history.\")\r\n\r\nA conspicuous example of the faults of this class of story is found in\r\n\"Sylvia in flowerland,\" by Linda Gardner. The heroine is introduced as a\r\nhigh-school girl, well-advanced in Latin and mathematics, and amply able\r\nto supplement very largely the information which the flowers give her\r\nabout themselves. Linda strolls into the fields and is told all sorts of\r\nfacts about the habits of plants by the flowers. The story where the\r\nauthor forgets to interject puns is interestingly told, certainly enough\r\nso to attract a girl of fourteen, who has any fondness for flowers.\r\nBesides the numerous puns, such glaring sentences as the following,\r\ncondemn it. \"I don't know who you mean.\" \"Why it is a nasty nettle\"!\r\nsaid Sylvia. \"Nasty, yourself,\" ejaculated the nettle sharply, \"why do\r\nyou come shoving against me?\"\r\n\r\nMcCook's \"Old farm fairies,\" gives what Mrs. Malaprop calls \"a\r\nsupercilious knowledge\" in its attempt to interest children in insect\r\nlife, by introducing different insects in the form of pixies, brownies\r\nand fairies. While it has not the faults of \"Sylvia in flowerland,\" the\r\ninformation is mainly crowded into footnotes and appendices, which as a\r\nrule are carefully avoided by children.\r\n\r\nMabel Osgood Wright's \"Tommy Anne\" and \"Wabeno\" are more successful; but\r\nthe same amount of energy spent in making the facts of nature\r\ninteresting in themselves would be preferable.\r\n\r\nWhile not assuming an absolute censorship in this department, the\r\nprinciple of natural selection may be applied in discarding such books\r\nas are characterized by the faults here cited, that we may do our share\r\ntowards discouraging a taste for facetiousness, flippancy and poor style\r\nin literature. For while these modern, sham, soulless fairy tales soon\r\nlose themselves in the overwhelming mass of printed matter, in their\r\nbrief existence they have time to accomplish considerable harm. Far\r\nbetter to encourage re-reading the imperishable tales, than to gratify\r\nan insatiable desire for more. Did not we ourselves again and again shed\r\nfresh tears over Cinderella's hard fate, or gasp with bated breath while\r\nwatching with Sister Ann for that distant speck on the horizon? If\r\nchildren are different to-day, it is partly because we are helping to\r\nmake them so.\r\n\r\n                                               ABBY L. SARGENT,\r\n                                 _Medford_ (_Mass._) _Public Library_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _III. SCIENCE FOR CHILDREN._\r\n\r\nIn the selection of books for children's libraries it is necessary to\r\nunderstand the difference between the aims and methods of the old\r\neducation and the new.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the schools have centered their work about man, studying\r\nhis language, literature, methods of reasoning, and the manner in which\r\nhe has partitioned off the earth into countries. No importance whatever\r\nwas attached to his physical surroundings, which form so great a factor\r\nin his life and by which he is so profoundly affected. In history, the\r\nstudy of dates, battles and leaders was all that was required. In\r\ngeography, the work was almost exclusively confined to a description of\r\nthe earth, the location of mountains, rivers, cities, and political\r\ndivisions. Before the establishment of the national Weather Bureau there\r\nwas scarcely any public interest manifested in the phenomena of the\r\natmosphere and its relation to various weather elements. Many of us can\r\nrecall from our own experience the picture of the earth divided into\r\nzones, but why such a division was made did not come up for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nWhat are we now aiming to do for the child? We are looking beyond the\r\nmere cultivation of memory; and we desire to increase the child's point\r\nof contact with the world, to bring him into closer relationship with\r\nthe life about him, to broaden his sympathies and to develop the powers\r\nof observation and reason. In so far as we are able to accomplish these\r\nresults, we shall make him happier by enabling him to understand the\r\ngreat laws that govern the universe. The child is learning that the\r\nfacts of history are the results of causes, that they are the working\r\nout of great principles and that by the comparison of the past with the\r\npresent he may be able to judge of the future. From a study of the\r\nphysical features of the earth he learns that slopes determine the\r\ncourse of rivers and that cities are dependent for their growth upon\r\nphysical environment. The consideration of the weather enables him to\r\nunderstand the state of the atmosphere about him, its effect on climate,\r\nthe cause of storms, and the different action of solar energy on air,\r\nland, and water, which renders possible life upon the earth. Science\r\ndemands an investigation of the growth and habits of plants and animals,\r\nthe relationship of one form to another, the function and adaptation of\r\nparts, the effect of surroundings, while form and structure are results,\r\nnot ends.\r\n\r\nWe want to lead the child from results back to causes. The possession of\r\na vast number of facts, unrelated among themselves, is valueless and\r\neven harmful, for the child does not look upon nature as a whole.\r\nNature-study, perhaps more than any other subject, leads the child into\r\nsympathy with his environment. He observes carefully and thoughtfully\r\nand thus the individual is developed. From personal contact with nature\r\nhe gains the power of accurate observation, correct thinking and\r\njudgment; thus strengthening his moral character. If this is the effect\r\nof nature-study upon the development of the child, the question comes to\r\nthe librarian--What principles shall guide me in the selection of books\r\nthat the library with which I am connected may be of assistance in\r\naccomplishing these results, and meet the demand of modern education?\r\n\r\nA book for children should be attractive. The exterior should present a\r\nharmony of color and tasteful decoration. The text should be printed\r\nwith clear type upon good paper and should be well illustrated. Colored\r\nplates are preferable, provided the coloring is good, otherwise\r\nuncolored illustrations are far more desirable. The text should be\r\nclear, simple, and scientifically correct.\r\n\r\nThe new scientific book differs from the old. The old style book gave\r\ndead results, no sympathy in or interest for life was aroused, no\r\nsuggestions were given for first-hand observations of nature,\r\nconsequently the book failed to stimulate a desire for personal\r\ninvestigation that could be verified by the recorded work of others. The\r\nnew scientific book not only gives results but a detailed account of the\r\nmethods employed in obtaining those results. The reader is interested in\r\ntrying the same experiments, gains a sympathy and interest in the\r\nwonderful life history of a plant, bird, or insect, develops a\r\ntenderness for life and feels that all nature is a sympathetic unit.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years the interest that has been aroused throughout\r\nthe country in \"nature-study,\" has caused a great demand for this class\r\nof books. Writers and publishers have hastened to meet the demand and as\r\na result the market has been flooded with books that were made to sell.\r\nToo often the writers have not been scientific persons, and as a result\r\nthe books have been mere compilations, or were not true to facts. They\r\nlacked the true spirit of science. Other authors have not separated the\r\nelement of fiction from that of science, thinking that the child could\r\nonly be interested in nature by means of a story. The writer of this\r\npaper does not believe that science books should be made story books.\r\n\"Tenants of an old farm,\" by McCook, is a good illustration of the\r\ncombination of the science and story element. The author is a naturalist\r\nand whatever facts are presented may be accepted as being as nearly\r\ncorrect as it is possible to make them since they represent the results\r\nof careful personal observation. The author himself did not believe that\r\nthe truths of nature were so unattractive that they needed to be woven\r\ninto a story in order that the book might find its way to the general\r\nreader. Then why did he employ this method? He was persuaded by his\r\nfriends to change the original plan of the book and presented it, after\r\nmuch hesitation, in its present form. The book has thereby lost much of\r\nits usefulness.\r\n\r\nAnother element that many authors have employed to a greater or less\r\nextent is personification. That the value of a book is lessened thereby\r\nand its power over the reader greatly decreased, is beyond question.\r\nThere may be some excuse for a limited amount of personification in the\r\ntreatment of bees, wasps, or ants, but the majority of forms of plant\r\nand animal life does not need the human factor in order to make clear\r\nlife-relationships. Grant Allen, in his \"Story of the plants,\" has\r\ndescribed the use of the stamens and pistils as \"how plants marry\" and\r\nthe modes of fertilization as \"various marriage customs.\" Allen Gould,\r\nin \"Mother Nature's children,\" speaks of the \"snakehead\" fish and its\r\nyoung as \"Mr. and Mrs. Snakehead and their babies\" and of the\r\nseed-vessels of plants as \"ways the mother plants have of cradling their\r\nbabies.\" This method of treating nature's truths does not make the facts\r\nany clearer to the child; it only tends to diminish the grandeur of that\r\ntruth. Some writers have considered it desirable to embody the thought\r\nin terms that are already, or are supposed to be, familiar to the child,\r\nthat he may be able to grasp the truth. The author forces upon the child\r\na double task, since he must first get the thought as it appears and\r\nthen search for the concealed fact. This process is not liable to be\r\nsuccessful. Mrs. Dana, in \"Plants and her children,\" uses the term\r\n\"sweet stuff\" for nectar, \"watery-broth\" for the cell-sap of plants. The\r\nfood of plants is spoken of as the \"plant's bill of fare,\" and in\r\nexpressing the fact that the crude sap which is taken up by the roots\r\nneeds to be converted into elaborated sap before it may be used as food,\r\nshe says \"When the watery broth is cooked in the sun, the heat of the\r\nsun's rays causes the water to pass off through the little leaf mouths.\r\nThus the broth is made fit for plant food.\" Must not the child possess\r\nsome scientific knowledge before he will be able to understand the\r\nauthor's meaning? \"Plants and her children\" is a valuable book, but\r\nwould not its merits be greatly enhanced if the scientific facts were\r\ntold in simple language? They certainly have interest enough in\r\nthemselves to be attractive to the child. Books like Hooker's \"Child's\r\nbook of nature\" should be discarded. They represent the old scientific\r\nthought. No sympathy or interest in life is aroused, no relationships\r\nare suggested, no adaptation to environment is shown, no incentive is\r\ngiven for personal observation. Why should we cling to the old when a\r\nbook can be obtained that will more nearly satisfy our needs?\r\n\r\nThere is often a great difference in the individual merits of books by\r\nthe same author. Mabel Osgood Wright's \"Birdcraft\" is valuable, while\r\n\"Tommy Anne and the three hearts\" and \"Wabeno\" are the reverse. The last\r\ntwo represent a type of book that should not be included in a science\r\nlibrary. The fairy and story element so greatly exceeds the scientific\r\nas to render the books absolutely valueless, nor are they a success from\r\na literary standpoint. No book in which the author wanders from one\r\nsubject to another, in such rapid succession that the reader has\r\ndifficulty in following the thought, or is so vague that an effort must\r\nbe made to understand the topic treated, can be of much practical value.\r\nThe greater number of the Appleton's \"Home reading books\" possess little\r\nmerit. The selections were not written for children; they lack\r\nsimplicity, are not attractive and are too technical. The article \"The\r\nlife of plants\" in \"Plant world\" would require two or three readings by\r\nan adult in order to understand what the author was discussing. The best\r\nbooks in this series are Weed's \"Insect world\" and Holden's \"Family of\r\nthe sun\" and \"Stories of great astronomers.\" Such books as Fanny\r\nBergen's \"Glimpses at the plant world,\" Carpenter's \"Geographies,\"\r\nKearton's \"Our bird friends,\" and Weed's \"Stories of Insect life\"\r\nrepresent the style of book that the elementary science of to-day\r\ndemands. We do not wish to make scientists of the children, but by means\r\nof the best books on nature-study we would prepare the way for\r\nelementary science. _Nature-study_ is not _science_, for science is\r\nclassified knowledge. So far as possible let the elements of\r\npersonification and fiction be omitted, do not select books that are too\r\ntechnical or vague, that are not well illustrated, and that are not true\r\nto science.\r\n\r\nThen our libraries will contain books that will incite the self-activity\r\nof the child and arouse the spirit of investigation; books that will\r\nstimulate observation and inculcate a spirit of tenderness and love for\r\nall life.\r\n\r\n                                ELLA A. HOLMES, _Assistant curator,\r\n    Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BULLETIN WORK FOR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n BY CHARLOTTE ELIZABETH WALLACE, _Hazelwood Branch, Carnegie Library of\r\n                              Pittsburgh_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary object of bulletin work is to direct the attention of the\r\nchildren to the books. The bulletin, like a poster, attracts the eye,\r\narouses interest in a subject, and advertises the books treating of it.\r\nBy means of picture bulletins interest may be awakened in topics before\r\nunnoticed; the children are curious to learn more about the pictures\r\ndisplayed, their curiosity is further excited by the short descriptive\r\ntext, and as a result books relating to the subject are read. Thus,\r\nwithout rousing the children's suspicions, we are able to guide their\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nThe second object is the cultivation of the children's appreciation for\r\npictures. If we can catch the eye by attractive pictures, we may add to\r\nthe children's store of ideas, and aside from broadening their\r\nknowledge, bring them under the beneficent influence of beauty. Pictures\r\nof æsthetic value placed in a children's room in which harmony of\r\ndecoration, furniture, and arrangement have been considered, exert a\r\nvitally refining influence. When we realize how painfully lacking in\r\nrefinement are many of the homes of the children who visit the library,\r\nhow blinded are their eyes to beauty because of their sordid\r\nsurroundings, we shall then see how essential it is to enrich their\r\nlives by every means of cultivation appropriate to our field of work.\r\n\r\nWhatever we may do in bulletin work must accord with the high standard\r\nof taste evidenced in all of the fittings of a dignified library. While\r\nwe are to aim to attract the children by bulletins which are simple and\r\nchildlike in spirit, we must keep a sharp lookout that in our effort to\r\nplease them our bulletins do not become tawdry and fussy in style. We\r\nare to meet the children on their level and yet educate their taste to a\r\nhigher standard.\r\n\r\nThe first practical consideration of bulletin-making is the collection\r\nof material. Pictures may be obtained from a variety of sources. Old\r\nmagazines, book announcements, publishers' catalogues, book covers, book\r\nplates, railroad guides, advertising sheets, posters, special prints,\r\netc., form the main sources of supply. In addition to a stock of\r\ngood-toned gray mounting-board for regular use, colored mounting-board\r\nmay be employed as a suitable background for colored prints, or to\r\nexpress the main idea of the bulletin--a delicate shade of green making\r\nan effective mount for certain pictures for bulletins on \"Spring.\"\r\n\r\nThe choice of subject is of supreme importance. We should study the\r\nchildren whom we are trying to benefit, that we may discover their\r\ntastes and learn their interests. We may select a subject in line with\r\nthe course of school study. This serves not only to illustrate a subject\r\nin which the children are already interested, but is an incidental means\r\nof making known to the teacher and pupils the usefulness of the library\r\nin furnishing reading supplementary to the school studies. We may\r\nbulletin a subject of transient interest, thus informing the children\r\nalong this particular line; or, we may choose a topic which by the\r\nnovelty of its presentation, may arouse interest in an unfamiliar\r\nsubject, providing we make sure in choosing that we relate the unknown\r\nto the known. We always have a chance of illustrating some one of the\r\nuniversal interests of childhood. Spring and autumn exhibits, bulletins\r\non birds, flowers, and animals, certain anniversaries, etc., invariably\r\nprove attractive to children. The bulletins should be such as to satisfy\r\na catholicity of taste and cover a wide range in age and understanding.\r\nBut whatever be one's choice of subject, let it be carefully thought and\r\nwrought out, definite in plan and purpose, and worthy the necessary\r\nexpenditure of time, material, and effort.\r\n\r\nIt is well to read thoroughly on a subject before attempting to plan a\r\nbulletin. The reading of sketchy accounts in children's books is not a\r\nsufficient preparation for this work. It is better to turn to more\r\nsubstantial sources that we may penetrate the meaning of the subject for\r\nthe children, and reflect this in the selection and arrangement of the\r\npictures in the text, and in the talks with the children about the\r\nbulletin. We may thus reinforce the message of the bulletin and lead\r\nthe children to the best book where the information they are seeking may\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nThe explanatory text of the bulletin should be direct and simple.\r\nAccuracy of statement is essential; this is especially important in\r\nscientific subjects. Experiment has proved that a concise and simple\r\naccount will be read, when a longer statement is passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\nPoetry may be appropriately introduced to illustrate the thought of the\r\nbulletin. We should select the very best poems which will serve the\r\npurpose, making sure they are simple and clear enough in meaning to be\r\nreadily understood by the children. In bulletin work we have an\r\nopportunity to acquaint the children with the choicest poetry. In\r\naddition to displaying pictures which please the eye, we may also\r\npresent word-pictures, thus making a double appeal to the mind.\r\n\r\nAn annotated book list is of great service in connection with the\r\nbulletin. This enables the children to gain an idea of the subject\r\nmatter of the various books, and, if the notes are attractive, induces\r\nthem to read a book which otherwise might be ignored. In teaching the\r\nchildren the use of lists we are also preparing them for independent\r\nwork later. The books, it possible, should be placed on a shelf near the\r\nbulletin, that they may be conspicuous and easily accessible.\r\n\r\nNo matter how beautiful the collection of pictures, nor how happy the\r\nchoice of subject, a bulletin will not be successful unless it is well\r\nexecuted. Technical skill is also necessary in carrying out the idea.\r\nNot only should the bulletin direct attention to books but it should\r\nnourish æsthetic taste as well. Form is as important as subject.\r\nSlipshod mounting, unequal margins, untidy work in general, detract from\r\nthe appearance of the bulletin, and are most disastrous object lessons\r\nto children.\r\n\r\nWe must collect only material which is worth while and even from this\r\nselect with the greatest care. Sometimes it may be necessary to make use\r\nof weak or faulty prints in reference work, if a subject is sparingly\r\nillustrated, but such material should be reserved for this purpose\r\nrather than posted on bulletins.\r\n\r\nThere is danger in exhibiting more than one bulletin at a\r\ntime--exception being made, of course, for such bulletins as illustrate\r\nallied subjects, thus forming an exhibition. The display of too many\r\npictures on any one bulletin is equally inadvisable. Have we not all of\r\nus at times felt oppressed and confused by the seemingly endless array\r\nof pictures at a large art exhibit? The mind is overtaxed in the effort\r\nto grasp it all. Knowing the patience with which little children study a\r\npicture, even dwelling on the smallest detail with delight, it would be\r\nbetter to choose with discrimination, and avoid bewildering the minds of\r\nthe children, and fatiguing their attention by a large collection of\r\npictures. A miscellany of pictures or bulletins defeats its one\r\npurpose--that of making a definite impression which should lead to\r\nfurther investigation of a subject.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the bulletin should make its central thought and\r\nobject apparent. A bulletin on Lincoln's life if properly arranged could\r\neasily tell the story of the experiences between the log-cabin and White\r\nHouse. The pictures should have some logical grouping, whether by\r\nsuccession of events, or according to some natural relationship, as\r\nbringing a collection of wild flowers together in the order of their\r\nappearance, birds and animals by families, etc.\r\n\r\nConcerning the composition of the bulletin, we may borrow the rules of\r\npictorial composition and adapt them to bulletin purposes. According to\r\nJohn C. Van Dyke, \"Pictorial composition may be defined as the\r\nproportionate arranging and unifying of the different features and\r\nobjects of a picture.... There must be an exercise of judgment on the\r\npart of the artist as to fitness and position, as to harmony of\r\nrelation, proportion, color, light; and there must be a skilful uniting\r\nof all the parts into one perfect whole.\" In a bulletin as in a picture\r\nthere must be a center of interest. We should strive to effect this by\r\nselecting for this purpose a picture which has earned its place, because\r\nit best suggests the subject, or because pictorially, either through\r\ntone or color, it best adapts itself to the principles of composition.\r\nThe other pictures should be grouped accordingly, always taking account\r\nof the subject and artistic value of each in placing them. The bulletin\r\nshould be built up architecturally as well, letting the heavy pieces\r\nsupport the light. Such a picture as Rosa Bonheur's \"Ploughing\" should\r\nnot surmount Breton's \"Song of the lark.\"\r\n\r\nColor has its legitimate place in bulletin work as children are keenly\r\nalive to its attractiveness. It is because they are so sensitive and\r\nimpressionable in this regard that our responsibility is proportionately\r\ngreater; this alone should make us most discreet and careful in its use.\r\nVan Dyke cautions us in the following terms: \"Beware of your natural\r\ntaste, beware of bright pictures for they are generally bad.\" He tells\r\nus \"That 'color' does not mean brightness alone; and that a 'colorist'\r\nis not one who deals in flaming colors with the recklessness of a\r\ncrazy-quilt maker, but one who justly regards the relationship, the\r\nqualities, and the suitableness of his colors one to another....\"\r\nHarmony strives to associate colors which are congenial to each other;\r\nhowever, it cannot be comprehended in the abstract. We bring to our\r\nbulletin work the results of our previous standards of taste, be these\r\nhigh or low. But we may raise our standards by holding ourselves\r\nreceptive to the influence of art, whether it be decorative, ceramic,\r\ntextile, or pictorial, and appropriate the lessons which it teaches in\r\nblending color into harmony. The love of prime colors is characteristic\r\nof primitive man, while the appreciation of the neutral tones is the\r\nacquirement of civilization. Intellectual development conforms to the\r\nepochs of racial progress. Children love crude and elementary colors.\r\nBut while we make concession to their taste we should also educate it to\r\nan appreciation of the refined in color.\r\n\r\nThe question of economy often arises in connection with bulletin work.\r\nAre bulletins sufficiently useful and effective to pay for the outlay of\r\ntime and money? In a system of central and branch libraries this is not\r\nso serious a problem as the same bulletin may be of service in the\r\nvarious libraries. The tendency toward extravagance would appear in the\r\nexcessive quantity of bulletins exhibited, rather than in the expensive\r\nquality of any one of them. Certainly we should strive to be economical\r\nin the sense of planning the material without loss or waste, but\r\n\"whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well,\" and the main\r\nquestion is, are bulletins worth doing at all? The bulletin justifies\r\nitself by the results it accomplishes in calling attention to subjects,\r\nguiding the reading, circulating books, and increasing the children's\r\nobservation and enjoyment of pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     REFERENCE WORK WITH CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n     BY HARRIET H. STANLEY, _Brookline_ (_Mass._) _Public Library_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary to preparing this report, a list of 15 questions was sent to\r\na number of libraries in different parts of the United States, from 24\r\nof which replies were received. So far as space would permit, the facts\r\nand opinions obtained have been embodied in this paper.\r\n\r\nReference work with grown people consists in supplying material on\r\nvarious topics; we consider it sufficiently well done when the best\r\navailable matter is furnished with as little cost of time and trouble to\r\nthe inquirer as is consistent with the service we owe to other patrons\r\nof the library. To a certain extent this statement is true also of\r\nreference work with children, but I think we are agreed that for them\r\nour aim reaches further--reaches to a familiarity with reference tools,\r\nto knowing how to hunt down a subject, to being able to use to best\r\nadvantage the material found. In a word, we are concerned not so much to\r\nsupply information as to educate in the use of the library. Seventeen of\r\nthe 24 libraries reporting judge children to be sent to them primarily,\r\nif not wholly, for information. One of the first steps towards improving\r\nand developing reference work with children will have been taken when\r\nthe teacher appreciates the larger purpose, since the point of view must\r\nmaterially affect the character and scope of the work. Another forward\r\nstep is for the library to have definitely in mind some plan for\r\naccomplishing these ends. Whatever the plan, it will in likelihood have\r\nto be modified to accord with the teacher's judgment and needs, but a\r\ndefinite proposal ought at least to give impetus to the undertaking.\r\n\r\nSix libraries state that a considerable part of the inquiries they\r\nreceive from children are apparently prompted by their individual\r\ninterests, and not suggested by the teacher. These inquiries relate\r\nchiefly to sports, mechanical occupations and pets. This paper is\r\nconfined to the discussion of reference work connected with the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Library facilities._\r\n\r\nIn selecting reference books for the purpose, certain familiar ones come\r\nat once to our minds. Beyond those there have been suggested: Chase and\r\nClow's \"Stories of industry,\" \"Information readers,\" Brown's \"Manual of\r\ncommerce,\" Boyd's \"Triumphs and wonders of the 19th century,\" Patton's\r\n\"Resources of the United States,\" Geographical readers, _Youth's\r\nCompanion_ geographical series, Spofford's \"Library of historic\r\ncharacters,\" Larned's \"History for ready reference,\" Ellis's \"Youth's\r\ndictionary of mythology,\" Macomber's \"Our authors and great inventors,\"\r\nBaldwin's \"Fifty famous stories,\" \"Riverside natural history,\" Wright's\r\n\"Seaside and wayside,\" bound volumes of the _Great Round World_, and\r\ntext-books on various subjects.\r\n\r\nA dictionary catalog will be useful in teaching the child to look up\r\nsubjects for himself. If a separate catalog is provided for children,\r\nthe question arises whether it is wiser to follow closely the A. L. A.\r\nheadings or to modify them where they differ from topics commonly asked\r\nfor by children or used as headings in text-books. This question\r\nsuggests also the advisability of a modified classification for a\r\nchildren's library.\r\n\r\nLast and not least, children should have room and service adapted to\r\ntheir needs, so that they may not constantly have to be put aside in\r\ndeference to the rightful demands of adult readers.\r\n\r\nSo far as the writer knows, the Public Library of Boston was the first\r\nlibrary to open a reference room expressly for children, well equipped\r\nand separate from the children's reading room or circulating department,\r\nand from the general reference department for adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Choice of topics._\r\n\r\nMany libraries report that they find the topics habitually well chosen.\r\nThe gist of the criticisms is as follows:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The teacher should make clear to the child just what he is to look\r\nup and how to ask for it. An eastern library furnishes this incident:\r\n\r\n\"I want a book about flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want a special flower?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I want the rose.\"\r\n\r\nA book on the cultivation of roses is handed her. Her companion, looking\r\nover, exclaims, \"Why, she wants the _Wars of the roses_!\" The same\r\nlibrarian was invited to provide something on _American privileges_;\r\nwhether social, religious, political, or otherwise, the child did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The teacher should be reasonably sure that there is on the topic\r\nsomething in print, in usable shape, that can be gotten at with a\r\nreasonable amount of labor.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The subject when found should be within the child's comprehension.\r\nThe topic _Grasses_ is manifestly unfit for children, since grasses are\r\ndifficult to study, and the description of them in encyclopedias and\r\nbotanies is too technical. An eight-year-old had to investigate the\r\n_Abyssinian war_. Pupils under 16 were assigned the topic _Syncretism in\r\nthe later pagan movement_. A western librarian was asked by some girls\r\nfor Kipling's \"Many inventions\" and \"Day's work.\" Both were out. \"Well,\r\nwhat other books of Kipling's on _agriculture_ have you?\" \"Why, Kipling\r\nhasn't written any books on _agriculture_; he writes stories and poems.\"\r\n\"But we have to debate on whether agriculture or manufacturing has done\r\nmore for the welfare of the country, and we want a book on both sides.\"\r\n\r\n(_d_) The topic should be definite and not too broad, and should be\r\nsubdivided when necessary. The briefest comprehensive description of\r\n_Rome_ is probably that in Champlin's \"Persons and places,\" where the\r\nsix columns, already much condensed, would take more than an hour to\r\ncopy. A young girl came to find out about Italian painters. None of the\r\nseveral encyclopedias treated them collectively under either _Italy_ or\r\n_Art_. Mrs. Bolton's book of 10 artists includes four Italians, but it\r\ntakes some time and skill to discover them, as the fact of their\r\nnationality does not introduce the narrative. How should a sixth grade\r\npupil make a selection from the 60 painters in Mrs. Jameson's book?\r\nThree names were furnished by the librarian, and the child made notes\r\nfrom their biographies. The next day she returned and said she hadn't\r\nenough artists.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The question should preferably be of such nature that the child\r\ncan be helped to find it rather than be obliged to wait while the\r\nlibrarian does the work. One inquiry was, \"What eastern plant is\r\nsometimes sold for its weight in gold?\" This is not in the book of\r\n\"Curious questions.\"\r\n\r\n(_f_) The topic should be worth spending time upon. The _genealogy of\r\nEllen Douglas_ will hardly linger long in the average memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Use made of the material by the child._\r\n\r\nSuppose the topic to be good and suitable material to have been found;\r\nfor older children there are two good ways of using it--one to read\r\nthrough and make notes on the substance, the other to copy in selection.\r\nChildren need practice in doing both. The first method suits broad\r\ndescription and narration, the second detailed description. There seems\r\nto be a prevailing tendency to copy simply, without sufficient neglect\r\nof minor points, a process which should be left to the youngest\r\nchildren, since it furnishes little mental training, uses a great deal\r\nof time, keeps the writer needlessly indoors, and fosters habits of\r\ninattention, because it is easy to copy with one's mind elsewhere. The\r\nnecessity for using judgment after the article has been found is\r\nillustrated by the case of some children who came for the life of Homer.\r\nChamplin, in about a column, mentions the limits within which the\r\nconjectures as to the time of Homer's birth lie, the places which claim\r\nto be his birthplace, and tells of the tradition of the blind harper.\r\nThe children, provided with the book, plunged at once into copying until\r\npersuaded just to read the column through. \"When you finish reading,\" I\r\nsaid, \"come to me and tell me what it says.\" They came and recounted the\r\nitems, and only after questioning did they at all grasp the gist of the\r\nmatter, that nothing is known about Homer. Even then their sense of\r\nresponsibility to produce something tangible was so great that they\r\nwould copy the details, and from the children who came next day I judged\r\nthat the teacher had required some facts as to time and place and\r\ntradition. While it is true that we learn by doing and it is well that\r\nchildren should rely upon themselves, it is evident that young pupils\r\nneed some direction. Even when provided with sub-topics, they often need\r\nhelp in selecting and fitting together the appropriate facts, since no\r\narticle exactly suits their needs. About half of the reporting\r\nlibrarians are of the opinion that it is the teacher's business to\r\ninstruct pupils in the use of books; they consider the library to have\r\ndone its share when the child has been helped to find the material. The\r\nother half believe such direction as is suggested above to be rightly\r\nwithin the librarian's province; several, however, who express a\r\nwillingness to give such help, add that under their present library\r\nconditions it is impracticable. We can easily see that time would not\r\npermit nor would it be otherwise feasible for the teacher to examine\r\nevery collection of notes made at the library, but there ought to be\r\nsome systematic work where the topics are thoughtfully chosen, the\r\nlibrarian informed of them in advance, and the notes criticised. A\r\nmoderate amount of reference work so conducted would be of greater\r\nbenefit than a large quantity of the random sort which we now commonly\r\nhave. Five librarians state that they are usually given the topics\r\nbeforehand. Several others are provided with courses of study or attend\r\ngrade meetings in which the course is discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Systematic instruction in the use of the library._\r\n\r\nWhile a general effort is being made to instruct children individually,\r\nonly a few libraries report any systematic lessons. In Providence each\r\nvisiting class is given a short description of books of reference. In\r\nHartford an attempt at instruction was made following the vacation book\r\ntalks. In Springfield, Mass., last year the senior class of the\r\nliterature department was given a lesson on the use of the library,\r\nfollowed by two practice questions on the card catalog. In one of the\r\nCleveland branches talks are given to both teachers and pupils. At the\r\nCentral High School of Detroit the school librarian has for the past\r\nthree years met the new pupils for 40 minutes' instruction, and test\r\nquestions are given. A detailed account of similar work done in other\r\nhigh school libraries is to be found in the proceedings of the\r\nChautauqua conference. Cambridge has given a lecture to a class or\r\nclasses of the Latin school. In the current library report of Cedar\r\nRapids, Ia., is outlined in detail a course of 12 lessons on\r\nbookmaking, the card catalog, and reference books. The librarian of\r\nMichigan City, Ind., writes: \"Each grade of the schools, from the fifth\r\nto the eighth, has the use of our class room for an afternoon session\r\neach month. Each child is assigned a topic on which to write a short\r\ncomposition or give a brief oral report. When a pupil has found all he\r\ncan from one source, books are exchanged, and thus each child comes into\r\ncontact with several books. At these monthly library afternoons I give\r\nshort talks to the pupils on the use of the library, the reference\r\nbooks, and the card catalog, accompanied by practical object lessons and\r\ntests.\" At Brookline our plan is to have each class of the eighth and\r\nninth grades come once a year to our school reference room at the\r\nlibrary. The teacher accompanies them, and they come in school hours.\r\nThe school reference librarian gives the lesson. For the eighth grade we\r\nconsider the make-up of the book--the title-page in detail, the\r\nimportance of noting the author, the significance of place and date and\r\ncopyright, the origin of the dedication, the use of contents and index.\r\nThis is followed by a description of bookmaking, folding, sewing and\r\nbinding, illustrated by books pulled to pieces for the purpose. The\r\nlesson closes with remarks on the care of books. The ninth grade lesson\r\nis on reference books, and is conducted largely by means of questioning.\r\nA set of test questions at the end emphasizes the description of the\r\nbooks. In these lessons the pupils have shown an unexpected degree of\r\ninterest and responsiveness. The course brought about 400 children to\r\nthe library, a few of whom had never been there before. These were\r\nescorted about a little, and shown the catalog, charging desk,\r\nbulletins, new book shelves, etc. Every one not already holding a card\r\nwas given an opportunity to sign a registration slip. The following year\r\nthe eighth grade, having become the ninth, has the second lesson. With\r\nthese lessons the attitude of the children towards the library has\r\nvisibly improved, and we are confident that their idea of its use has\r\nbeen enlarged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Bibliographical work._\r\n\r\nThe inquiry was made of the reporting libraries whether any\r\nbibliographical work was being done by the high school. The question was\r\nnot well put, and was sometimes misunderstood. Almost no such work was\r\nreported. At Evanston, Ill., one high school teacher has taught her\r\nclass to prepare bibliographies, the librarian assisting. At Brookline\r\nwe have ambitions, not yet realized, of getting each high school class\r\nto prepare one bibliography a year (we begin modestly) on some subject\r\nalong their lines of study. Last May the principals of two grammar\r\nschools offered to try their ninth grades on a simple bibliography. The\r\nschool reference librarian selected some 60 topics of English\r\nhistory--Bretwalda, Sir Isaac Newton, East India Company, the Great\r\nCommoner, etc. Each bibliography was to include every reference by\r\nauthor, title and page to be found in the books of the school reference\r\ncollection of the public library. The pupils displayed no little zest\r\nand enjoyment in the undertaking, and some creditable lists were made.\r\nObservation of the work confirmed my belief in its great practical\r\nvalue. Pupils became more keen and more thorough than in the usual\r\ngetting of material from one or two references on a subject. Such\r\ntraining will smooth the way and save the time of those students who are\r\nto make use of a college library, and is even more to be desired for\r\nthose others whose formal education ends with the high or grammar\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThe practice of sending collections of books from the public library to\r\nthe schools is becoming general. When these collections are along the\r\nlines of subjects studied, it would seem as if the reference use of the\r\nlibrary by pupils might be somewhat diminished thereby. No doubt it is a\r\nconvenience to both teacher and pupils to have books at hand to which to\r\nrefer. The possession of an independent school library also tends to\r\nkeep the reference work in the school. But in neither case ought the\r\nreference use of the public library or its branches to be wholly or\r\nmaterially overlooked, since it is on that that pupils must depend in\r\nafter years, and therefore to that they must now be directed. We\r\nrecognize that the people of modest means need the library. As for the\r\nvery well-to-do, the library needs them. Other things being equal, the\r\npupil who has learned to know and to know how to use his public library\r\nought later so to appreciate its needs and so to recognize the benefits\r\nit bestows that he will be concerned to have it generously supported and\r\nwisely administered.\r\n\r\nEven we librarians claim for our public collections no such fine service\r\nas is rendered by those private treasures that stand on a person's own\r\nshelves, round which \"our pastime and our happiness will grow.\" Books\r\nfor casual entertainment are more and more easily come by. But so far as\r\nour imagination reaches, what private library will for most readers\r\nsupplant a public collection of books for purposes of study and\r\nreference? Is it not then fitting that we spend time and effort to\r\neducate young people to the use of the public library? Do not the\r\nmethods for realizing this end seem to be as deserving of systematic\r\nstudy as the details of classification and of cataloging? We have\r\nlearned that to bring school authorities to our assistance our faith\r\nmust be sufficient to convince and our patience must be tempered by a\r\nkindly appreciation of the large demands already made upon the schools.\r\nHave we not yet to learn by just what lessons and what practice work the\r\nreference use of the public library can best be taught to children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      VITALIZING THE RELATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND THE SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n                             I. THE SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n        BY MAY L. PRENTICE, _City Normal School, Cleveland, O._\r\n\r\n\r\nYears ago a little girl ran down a country road to meet the light wagon\r\nreturning from town with the purpose of climbing into the back and so\r\ngetting a ride. Without turning, the wise elder brother spoke from the\r\ndriver's seat: \"I wouldn't undertake that if I were you.\" And over his\r\nshoulder a breathless but dignified voice answered, \"But I have already\r\nundertooken it!\"\r\n\r\nA similar answer might reasonably be expected from the library to any\r\nwell-meant but tardy advice from the school-side in regard to the\r\nvitalization of the relation between the school and the library. It has\r\nalready been accomplished, and comparatively small thanks are due to the\r\nschool for its doing.\r\n\r\nGraded lists of books, special lists of materials for occasions, library\r\nleague work, the establishment of school branch libraries, all these\r\nhave been the work of the library in a much larger measure than of the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many teachers who share the library's buoyant faith\r\nin the blessing which books bring. These have been first to appreciate\r\nall which the library has offered them. They have accepted all that has\r\nbeen offered them and asked for more. They have circulated library books\r\nthrough their own schools, sometimes at considerable cost and trouble to\r\nthemselves, and for years have done all in their power to make their\r\npupils wise and discriminating patrons of the library. That the children\r\nof their care and love might have life and have it more abundantly--that\r\nis why they have done these things.\r\n\r\nThese teachers are comparatively few.\r\n\r\nThat it is any function of the school to give joy to its children is an\r\nidea of slow growth. A child's school-time is usually thought of as\r\npreparation for living and not as living itself. Hence the rebuke of the\r\nteacher to the child who interrupts the \"nature-lesson\" to blow the\r\nthistle-down which waves over his head, or to watch the bee which booms\r\nagainst the window-pane, or the hawk which floats lazily against the\r\nblue sky. Life is such a wild, wilful, irregular thing. Quietude,\r\nprudent inaction, is so much safer.\r\n\r\nSo with books. It is the old search for life, life, more abundant\r\nlife--for knowledge of it, for entrance into it--which sends the child\r\nto the fairy-story, the boy to the tale of adventure, the young girl to\r\nthe story of romance, the older man and woman to the realistic novel.\r\nAnd it is the instinctive feeling of the teacher and parent that life is\r\na dangerous force and difficult of control which has made school and\r\nhome look askance upon reading which the child finds too enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThere is another feeling or belief which lies back of our doubt of work\r\nor study or reading which is too enjoyable. It is in regard to the part\r\nwhich love of ease plays in human enjoyment. Love of ease is strong in\r\nhuman nature, and the man who tries to get his knowledge of human life\r\nmainly through the novel has indeed sought a short-cut to his end which\r\nwill bring him but a short distance on his way. This is not the time nor\r\nplace for the discussion of the value of fiction, but undoubtedly we are\r\ninclined to believe that man's indolence is a strong factor in man's\r\nenjoyment of certain lines of reading, and indolence is a bad thing.\r\nTherefore, we distrust the value of such reading. Whether we like or\r\ndislike it, however, we are obliged to admit that fiction is a permanent\r\nform of literature, that our children will read it, and that the\r\nquestion for us to settle is shall it be good or poor.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, has the teacher to do? Two things: To _be_ the atmosphere\r\nfrom which the child breathes in love for and delight in good books.\r\nThis is first. All things in the way of learning are possible after\r\nthis. Second, to be the pupil's guide and director in what may be called\r\nhis \"laboratory practice\" with books.\r\n\r\nThe Autocrat, mellowest of men of ideas, once suggested that every\r\ncollege and university should have a professorship of books. The\r\nAutocrat was an ingrained aristocrat, although one most mild and kind.\r\nThe true democratic idea is that a professorship of books should be\r\nestablished in every school-room.\r\n\r\nBut how shall the blind lead the blind? How shall the teacher who\r\nherself never has learned to know, to enjoy, and to choose good books\r\nguide others to do so?\r\n\r\nThe library is a storehouse of great thought, an unfailing source of\r\nhealthful recreation, but also the library is the mine in which the\r\npractical man and woman, the lawyer, the machinist, the scientist, the\r\nteacher, must dig deep for information, if he is to keep near the head\r\nin his own line of work.\r\n\r\nSo far, as I have said before, nearly all organized effort to teach the\r\nteachers along these lines has come from the library. Certain normal\r\nschool and college librarians have done much, but to a large extent the\r\nwork has been on sufferance. Odds and ends of the students' time and\r\nattention have been given to it.\r\n\r\nThe desirable thing is that the study of juvenile literature and the use\r\nof the library shall take equal rank with other studies in the\r\npreparation of prospective teachers; that the normal school, the\r\npedagogical department of the college and university, the teachers'\r\nsummer-school and institute, shall recognize this subject in their\r\ncurricula.\r\n\r\nThe practical side of library use--its use for information--is easily\r\nseen by the public, and schools for teachers can quite readily be\r\ninduced to make room for the course of study suggested.\r\n\r\nIn the Cleveland City Normal Training School an attempt to carry out\r\nsuch a course of study has been made. A term's work is given in juvenile\r\nliterature and the use of the library. Moreover, this subject is placed\r\nupon an equality with the philosophy of teaching, history of education\r\nand psychology.\r\n\r\nAs yet the work is not thoroughly organized. We feel, however, that some\r\nthings of value have been already accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn a twelve-weeks' term a class of 116 prospective teachers (the junior\r\nclass of the school) have taken notes on a series of talks on reference\r\nbooks. They have learned something of the comparative value of various\r\nstandard encyclopædias, gazetteers, dictionaries and indexes, and they\r\nhave been sent to the public library a half-day at a time to do work\r\nwhich required the use of these.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a study of the life of Robert Louis Stevenson was made for\r\nthe purpose of giving a talk on the subject to fifth-grade pupils. The\r\nstudents were required to look up all the available material in the\r\nlibrary, looking not only in the printed and card catalogs for\r\nindividual and collective biography, but in the various\r\nindexes--Poole's, the Annual, the Cumulative--for magazine articles.\r\nThey were required to select the four or five articles found most\r\nvaluable and to estimate their comparative value for the purpose in\r\nhand, making definite statements of the points of value. They were\r\nrequired to make careful and well-worded notes from the best material\r\navailable, either books or periodicals, always giving the source, and to\r\nread these notes in class subject to the criticism of their instructor\r\nand school mates. And, lastly, they were required to write the story of\r\nStevenson's life as they would tell it to the children.\r\n\r\nCareful instruction in the use of the printed and card catalogs and of\r\nindexes had preceded this assignment. We were fortunate in possessing\r\nquite a large number of issues of the Cumulative index unbound. It was\r\nthus possible to place one of these in the hands of each student during\r\ninstruction on the subject. This was a considerable aid.\r\n\r\nThere was too much work with the less-used ready-reference books. Next\r\nyear the number will be largely reduced.\r\n\r\nA study of fairy stories was made. An attempt was made to find a\r\nphilosophical basis for the love of children for fairy stories. An\r\nattempt was made to discriminate between the good and the bad fairy\r\nstory. Felix Adler's \"Moral instruction of children\" was helpful here,\r\nbut the study of the fairy stories at first hand is still more helpful.\r\n\r\nThe following books were read by the whole class:\r\n\r\n(1) Alcott's \"Little Women.\" Lessons were given on reading it with the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n(2) Mara L. Pratt's \"History stories,\" vol. 3.\r\n\r\n(3) Eggleston's \"First lessons in American history.\" The Pratt and\r\nEggleston books were read in succession for the purpose of contrasting\r\nthem. A yet better contrast would have been Baldwin's \"Fifty famous\r\nstories.\"\r\n\r\n(4) Frau Spyri's \"Heidi.\" Some of our girls read this story in the\r\noriginal German but most in the translation published by Ginn & Co. It\r\nis a charming story of a breezy little maiden whose home was in the\r\nSwiss Alps, and one of the rather scarce desirable books for the fourth\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\n(5) Mrs. Burnett's \"Sara Crewe.\" This was read as a type of the \"child\r\nnovel\" and for the sake of a study of the charms, dangers and benefits\r\nof this class of books.\r\n\r\n(6) Howard Pyle's \"Men of iron\" was read as a study of the worthy\r\nhistorical story.\r\n\r\nThe following outline was given the students as an aid in judging the\r\nbooks read:\r\n\r\n            _Outline to aid in estimating a juvenile book_.\r\n\r\n  1. Written when? By whom? For children or adults? [e.g., \"Robinson\r\n      Crusoe\" and \"Gulliver's travels\" were written for adults.] If for\r\n      children, of what age? (Consider both manner and matter.)\r\n\r\n  2. Essential purpose of the book: Recreative? Instructive? Moral? Is\r\n      the recreation afforded wholesome? The instruction reliable? The\r\n      moral lessons sound?\r\n\r\n  3. Style: Is it clear? Correct? Beautiful? Suitable?\r\n\r\n  4. If a story, What is the strongest character in it? The most\r\n      effective passage? Give reasons for thinking so. Is it true to\r\n      life?\r\n\r\n  5. Is the book a creator of ideals? How so? Along what lines?\r\n\r\nAn effort was made that there should be no formal adherence to this\r\noutline. Papers on the books read were required in which the outline\r\ncould not be used. For example, after reading \"Men of iron\" the students\r\nwere required to write, in class, a paper on \"The education of a boy in\r\nchivalry\" based on the story of Myles Falworth.\r\n\r\nThe oral discussions of these books were often very animated.\r\n\r\nEach student was also required to hand in an annotated list of at least\r\n20 books actually read by the student and judged by her suitable for the\r\ngrade in which she is to train. An oral discussion of these lists took\r\nplace, and the student in many cases was required to justify her\r\njudgment, and to answer questions in regard to the books read.\r\n\r\nSome of these lists were very cheering. One excellent list for the sixth\r\ngrade, with very original annotations contained 60 instead of 20 books\r\nactually read, and 30 more which the student had listed to be read at\r\nher convenience.\r\n\r\nNot all of the lists were of that character. A list for the third grade\r\nrecommended \"Gulliver's travels, by Gulliver\" as a valuable aid in\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\nThe instance is eloquent of the value of a course of study which results\r\nin the illumination or the elimination of such a student.\r\n\r\nMuch remains to be worked out, but a beginning has been made.\r\n\r\nOurs is one instance of the awakening of the school to the value of the\r\nprivileges which the library gives it. And as the reward of doing work\r\nwell is invariably to have more work to do, from the school fully\r\nawakened the library shall receive its exceeding great reward in more\r\nwork to be done.\r\n\r\nExcept for the hearty co-operation of the Cleveland Public Library the\r\nlittle experiment here outlined could not have been undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      VITALIZING THE RELATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARY AND THE SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n                            II. THE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\nBY IRENE WARREN, _Librarian University of Chicago School of Education_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Library Section of the National Educational\r\nAssociation was proof that the thoughtful librarians and school men of\r\nthis country believed that an effective co-operation between public\r\nschools and public libraries was possible. In many states library\r\nsections of the state teachers' associations have been formed. Many\r\npublic libraries have for some time past systematically sent both books\r\nand lists of books to the public schools.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had this been done than librarians and teachers both saw that\r\nthey had made but a beginning, and the next steps, and, indeed, the\r\npresent needs, are to bring about a more intelligent use of both books\r\nand libraries and to place larger and better arranged collections within\r\neasy access of the pupils. Rarely do the teachers find the libraries\r\nadequate to the reference work or the collateral reading they wish the\r\npupils to do. The funds are seldom sufficient to keep the libraries up\r\nto date. There is no one person in the school who knows how to organize\r\nand administer the library, and therefore whatever work the teachers do\r\nin this line is at a greater expense of both time, energy and material\r\nthan it would be were it done by one having had a library training. The\r\nschool buildings are frequently closed to the students shortly after the\r\nschool session, usually by five o'clock, and always on holidays and\r\nduring vacations. Most of the pupils' reading and research must\r\ntherefore be done in the one or two books which he carries home with\r\nhim. The Buffalo Public Library made another step in organization when\r\nit offered to take the collections of books from any of the public\r\nschools in the city and in return mend, rebind, catalog, classify them,\r\nfurnish such schools as agreed to this arrangement with the books they\r\nneeded, either from their own collections or from that of the public\r\nlibrary, and appoint two attendants to look after the school work.\r\n\r\nThe public school began with the one central school in the community,\r\nbut it soon found that it must establish branches if it reached all of\r\nthe children of the city. To-day there is no town of any considerable\r\nsize but has its central school with a high school usually, and its\r\nbranches on the north, east, south and west sides. The public library,\r\nfollowing the public schools, has found that it cannot reach the people\r\nof the community unless it delivers books to the various parts of the\r\ntown, and moreover establishes branch reading rooms where at least\r\nreference books may be consulted and magazines read.\r\n\r\nAs in the history of the schools, so in the history of the libraries,\r\nprovision was first made for the mature student. Educators have been\r\nslow to see that they should begin with the child before he has\r\nestablished habits of thought and action. Not until the public library\r\nis considered a vital factor in the educational scheme of a city can it\r\nhope to secure its best results, nor is this possible when the central\r\nlibrary and its few branches are removed, as at present, from the public\r\nschools. The libraries and the schools should be housed in close\r\nproximity to do the most effective work.\r\n\r\nIt is with keen interest that the experiment in New York City is being\r\nwatched. It certainly seems as if the most economical arrangement would\r\nbe to have the branch of the public library so placed in a school\r\nbuilding that the students would have free access to it, and the public\r\nalso, not only during school hours but public library hours. It seems\r\nthe logical duty of the board of education to furnish the few necessary\r\nreference books that are in continual demand in every school room and\r\nalso the sets of books which are used for supplementary reading. It\r\ndoes, on the other hand, seem that the public library can furnish a\r\nlarger general collection, in better editions and keep them in better\r\ncondition for less money and with better results than can the public\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThe already crowded curriculum in most of our public schools made many\r\nan educator hesitate when a course in library economy was suggested. One\r\ncan indeed see a time not far distant, it is hoped, when such a course\r\nwill not be thought necessary. Such a time will be when instructors have\r\nawakened to a much greater appreciation of the value and use of\r\nbibliography and the need of training students in this line. Along with\r\nthis will develop a desire in the student to keep his own references and\r\nmaterial so arranged that he will be able to use them easily. There will\r\nstill be considerable of a general bibliographical character, handbooks,\r\netc., which would be of value in all subjects and yet perhaps be\r\noverlooked by the specialists, that could be called to the students'\r\nattention through such a pamphlet as was recently compiled by Mr. Andrew\r\nKeogh, of Yale University Library, under the title, \"Some general\r\nbibliographical works of value to the students of English.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a phase of library economy that every teacher should know, and\r\nwhich it seems must always have its proper place in the curriculum of\r\nthe normal school. That is the knowledge of how to obtain books. Every\r\nteacher should know what the laws of his state are regarding the\r\nestablishment and maintenance of the public library and the public\r\nschool library, and how these laws compare with those of other states.\r\nHe should know what aid he can gain through the travelling library\r\nsystem, should he be in a village or country district, and the possible\r\nco-operation between the public library and the public schools should he\r\nbe assigned to a city. Just as the public schools are finding that they\r\nmust adapt their curriculum to the needs of the children of a certain\r\ndistrict or class, so the public library has the same lesson to learn.\r\nThe Carnegie Public Library of Pittsburgh has been one of the first to\r\nrecognize this in the establishment of home libraries. It has thus\r\nreached a class of children that could be reached in no other way, and\r\nwhy should not the public library as well as the public school aim to\r\nreach these less fortunate children?\r\n\r\nThe subject of children's literature should be a serious one with every\r\nteacher of children. The best writers for children, best illustrators,\r\nand best editions should be part of the normal school student's\r\nknowledge when he completes his course and goes out to teach. It is a\r\ngreat problem with him now how he shall keep this information up to\r\ndate, when there are hundreds of books coming out every year and his\r\nschool-room duties absorb so much of his time. Here is the librarian's\r\nopportunity to be of great aid to the public school teacher by issuing\r\nlists of the best children's books on various subjects, exhibiting them\r\nin the library from time to time, and to the schools for trial, as so\r\nmany libraries are now doing. In the country districts the library\r\ncommissions must supply this information through annotated lists.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in a number of schools that children love to make\r\nbooks, and that the making of books quite successfully lends itself to\r\nthe constructive work as carried on in the schools of to-day. The\r\nmaterials for this work are not so costly as to make it impossible for\r\nthe average school. Every child at the completion of the graded schools\r\nshould know the value of a title-page, the use of the preface and\r\nintroductory notes, the difference between the table of contents and the\r\nindex, the best books in the several subjects which he has studied, and\r\nwhere and how he can obtain more books on these subjects later, should\r\nhe wish them. It would doubtless be a great surprise to one who has not\r\ntried the experiment to ask the pupils in our graded and high schools\r\neven, for such simple information as the author, title and date of the\r\ntext-books they are using daily.\r\n\r\nIf the suggestions in this paper be accepted, and most of them have\r\nalready been successfully tried, it will be seen at once how great is\r\nthe importance of having trained librarians in our normal schools and\r\ninstitutions of higher learning. The time has now come in a number of\r\ncities which we hope is prophetic of the future, when the public library\r\nstands equally important as an educational institution with the public\r\nschool, each supplementing the other in work and still distinct in\r\nfunction and administration. It is therefore necessary that our teachers\r\nshould be trained to use libraries, and that our librarians should be\r\nacquainted with the great educational movements of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OPENING A CHILDREN'S ROOM.\r\n\r\n     BY CLARA WHITEHILL HUNT, _Newark (N. J.) Free Public Library_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing this paper on the opening of a children's room, I am\r\npresupposing the following conditions: That in a library whose work with\r\nthe children has been confined to the general delivery desk, and the\r\ndivided attention of clerks whose time an adult public would monopolize,\r\nthere is to be set aside a commodious apartment to be known as the\r\nChildren's Room; that, considering this work of enough importance to\r\ndemand such a department, the trustees are prepared to support it by a\r\nreasonable outlay for new books, necessary and convenient furnishings,\r\nand especially by placing in its charge one who, by natural fitness and\r\nspecial training they believe to be so thoroughly capable of supervising\r\nthe work, that she is to be given a free hand in deciding both how the\r\nroom is to be made ready for opening, and how managed after it is\r\nopened. This being the case, I imagine the children's librarian, with\r\nopening day a few weeks or months ahead, planning her campaign with such\r\nwise foresight and attention to the smallest detail that, in the rush of\r\nthe first weeks, there may be the least possible wear and tear on nerves\r\nand temper from petty inconveniences which assume gigantic proportions\r\nwhen one is hurried and tired, and the smallest amount of undoing and\r\nbeginning over again as time goes on.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to be clear in speaking of furnishings without something\r\nmore than verbal description for illustrating mistakes and excellences,\r\nbut so much power can be lost by not having the parts of the machine\r\nproperly fitted and well oiled that how to furnish the children's room\r\nbecomes one of the most important topics under this subject.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the children's librarian must cultivate, if she does not\r\nalready possess, the architect's faculty of seeing a completed structure\r\nin a flat piece of paper marked off by lines labelled 20 ft., 50 ft.,\r\netc. If 20 ft. does not mean anything to her she would do well to take a\r\ntape measure to an empty lot and measure off the exact dimensions of her\r\nroom to be, until she can see its floor space clearly. She should live\r\nin her room before its existence, locating every door and window, the\r\nheight of the windows from the floor, every corner and cupboard, the\r\nrelation of her room to the other departments of the library. In\r\nproceeding to furnish the room she will learn what to adopt and what to\r\navoid by visiting other children's rooms and asking if the tables and\r\nchairs are the correct height, if the exit is satisfactorily guarded,\r\nwhat working space is necessary for a certain circulation, whether the\r\nelectric light fixtures are easily broken, and many other things. If she\r\ncannot make such visits, her knowledge of children and a study of\r\nconditions in her own library will answer.\r\n\r\nLimited to a small space the children's room is nevertheless a\r\ncirculating department, a reading room, a reference room, perhaps a\r\nrepair room, and a cataloging department all in one; and if the\r\nchildren's librarian has not had actual work in each of these\r\ndepartments of her library, she should serve an apprenticeship at the\r\nreceiving and charging desks, the registration desk, the slip rack, not\r\nonly for the sake of knowing the routine of each department, but for\r\nstudying improvements in planning her furnishings. The registration\r\nclerk will tell her that she has not enough elbow room, that the\r\napplication drawers are too narrow or too heavy; the attendants at the\r\ncharging desk find every present arrangement so satisfactory that they\r\nadvise exact reproduction. Armed with pad and tape measure the\r\nchildren's librarian notes all these points.\r\n\r\nThe problem how with a minimum of help to \"run\" all departments, to see\r\nall parts of the room, to keep your eye on the entrance so as to nip in\r\nthe bud any tendency to boisterousness as the children come in, and to\r\nwatch the exit so that no book goes out uncharged, how to keep all\r\nunfinished work out of the children's reach but to give them perfectly\r\nfree access to the books, in short, how to arrange your working space so\r\nthat one person on a moderately busy day can attend to all these things,\r\nmay be answered, I think, in this way. All wall space will sooner or\r\nlater be needed for books. Taking an oblong floor space (dimensions\r\nproportionate to size of room and circulation) and surrounding this by a\r\ncounter 30 inches high and two feet wide, is a simple way of\r\naccomplishing these things. The counter opposite the entrance is the\r\nreceiving and charging desk; at another place it is the registration\r\ndesk; books after \"slipping\" are piled in another part ready for return\r\nto shelves; books waiting to be marked occupy a fourth section; the\r\ncatalog case, notices to children, call-slip holders, etc., stand on the\r\ncounter. The space under the counter is available for supply cupboards\r\nand drawers. The height of the counter is such that a grown person\r\nsitting in an ordinary chair works comfortably behind it, but it is so\r\nlow that no small child feels frowningly walled out in standing on the\r\nother side. Thus all the work of the room is concentrated and\r\nsupervision is easy. A few details are worth noticing. First, don't let\r\nthe carpenter give you drawers instead of cupboards. Drawers are\r\nwasteful of room for packing supplies, and of time in hunting for them.\r\nNext, have the cupboard doors slide, not swing, open, for economy of\r\nyour working floor space. Underneath registration and charging desks\r\nleave space empty for your feet. Just under counter near the\r\nregistration desk have a row of drawers, sliding easily but fastened so\r\nthey cannot fall out, made of the exact size to hold your application\r\nblanks and cards, with guide cards. A work table within the counter will\r\nbe necessary.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this working space, every large children's room should\r\nhave a locked closet, or better still, a work room opening from it. In\r\nbusy times things _will_ accumulate which must be kept out of reach, and\r\nit would not be sensible to take valuable space out of the children's\r\nroom to hold such accumulations until you have time to attend to them.\r\n\r\nThe height of the children's chairs and tables seems to have reached a\r\nstandard in children's rooms--tables 22 and 28 inches high, with chairs\r\n14 and 16 inches to go with them. I think it best to have very few\r\ntables of the smaller size, for tall boys take the strangest delight in\r\ncrouching over them, snarling their long legs around the short table\r\nlegs and trying, apparently, to get a permanent twist to their\r\nshoulders. Small children do not stay long, and it is less harmful, if\r\nnecessary, for them to sit in a chair a little too high than to compel\r\nlarge children to spend a holiday afternoon with bodies contorted to fit\r\na small chair and table.\r\n\r\nBy all means have the electric light _fixed_ in the center of the table\r\nso that each child gets an equal share of light, and have the\r\nconnections so made that jarring the table and the movements of restless\r\nfeet will not put the fixtures out of order. Be very careful not to have\r\nthe shade so high that the glare of the lamp instead of the restful\r\ngreen shade is opposite the child's eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a chair that you like, find out before purchasing whether\r\nit is very easily tipped over. You will know why, if you are not wise,\r\non some rainy day, when the room is full of readers and the reports of\r\nchairs suddenly knocked over sound like a fusillade of cannon balls.\r\n\r\nLeaving this hasty and most unsatisfactory discussion on getting the\r\n_place_ ready for opening, I would say a word about getting the _books_\r\nready--not about buying a large quantity of new, and putting the old\r\ninto the best possible condition of repair and cleanliness, for that\r\nwill naturally be done. But from experience I know that the moment is\r\ngolden for weeding out, never to return, authors you think\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nSuppose a girl reads nothing but the Elsie books. Very likely one reason\r\nis that she knows little about any other kind. In a printed catalog with\r\na scattering \"j\" between many titles of adult books it is easier to make\r\nlists of numbers from the long sets of prolific writers, and those\r\nexcellent authors who have produced only a few books for children are\r\noftenest overlooked. Suppose in the process of moving the Elsie books\r\nare left behind. The little girl comes into the beautiful new\r\nchildren's room. She sees the shining new furniture, the pictures, the\r\ncomfortable tables and chairs and book cases so planned that any child\r\ncan reach any book. She finds that there is perfect freedom for every\r\nchild in this room--that no stern Olympian comes and says, \"Don't do\r\nthis,\" and \"You can't have that,\" and \"Those books aren't for you,\" but\r\nthat among all these hundreds of fresh new covers she may take her pick,\r\nmay sit anywhere, or stand or kneel as she chooses. Do you imagine that,\r\nas these unaccustomed delights sink into her mind, any child is going\r\noff in a huff when she finds one author is lacking, if the children's\r\nlibrarian uses any tact in introducing her to others adapted to her\r\ntastes? I have been asked for Alger and Optic and Elsie, of course,\r\nthough much less often than I anticipated, but I am perfectly certain\r\nthat I have never lost a \"customer\" because I did not display these\r\nwares. One little girl exclaimed in doleful tones, \"Oh, haven't you the\r\nElsie books? Oh, I'm _terribly_ disappointed! I think those are _grand_\r\nbooks!\" But in spite of this tragic appeal her curiosity and interest\r\nproved stronger than her disappointment, and I have the satisfaction of\r\nseeing a more wholesome taste develop in a child who must have been on\r\nthe high road to softening of the brain and moral perversion from\r\nassociation with the insufferable Elsie. If you once put these books on\r\nthe open shelves, however, and later attempted the weeding out process,\r\na howl would arise which would not be silenced without consequences\r\nwhich I, for one, would not like to face.\r\n\r\nFurniture and books are comparatively simple matters to make ready, but\r\nto prepare your assistant or assistants for opening day and the time\r\nthat follows is harder. The external preparation for the rush of the\r\nfirst weeks consists in drill in the routine to be observed. Assigning a\r\nplace and certain duties to each person, foreseeing as far as possible\r\nall questions that may arise and making sure that each attendant\r\nunderstands what to do in any case, having a place for everything, and\r\neverything in its place, and every person knowing what that place is, so\r\nthat there will be no frantic search for an extra set of daters when a\r\nlong line of people stands waiting--this also requires only foresight\r\nand firmness. But so deeply to imbue your chief assistant with your\r\nspirit and principles of management that she will not simply obey your\r\ndirections, but be inwardly guided by your desires, and there may be no\r\nbreak in the steady march to a definite end--this demands that rare\r\nspecies of assistant who is born, not made, for the position, and a\r\nleader who possesses strength, tact, contagious enthusiasm, a likeable\r\npersonality, and other qualities difficult to attain.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the consideration of what the guiding principles of\r\nthe new department are to be--a question which must be pondered and\r\nsettled by the children's librarian before making the external\r\npreparations. If the senior members of the American Library Association,\r\nthe librarians-in-chief, would consider the children's room of enough\r\nimportance to give us their ideas of what it should stand for, what its\r\nscope should be, the result might be more uniformity of thought among\r\nmembers of the library profession in this regard, and a more sensible\r\nattitude toward the children's room in the library. Between those who,\r\non the one hand, take themselves so very seriously, pondering with\r\nanxious care what probable effect on the child's future career as a\r\nreader the selection of a blue or a green mat for mounting the picture\r\nbulletin would have, and those who look upon the children's room merely\r\nas an interesting plaything, driving the big boys away in disgust by\r\nencouraging visitors who exclaim, \"Oh, what cunning little chairs and\r\ntables! Why, you have a regular kindergarten here, haven't you?\"--from\r\neither point of view, the discussions on children's rooms in libraries\r\nseem almost to lose sight of the very word library and all it carries\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe children's room is only one room in a great dignified library. As\r\nthe newspaper room, the catalog room, and all the rest are fitted up\r\nwith furnishings suited to their peculiar needs, so the children's room\r\nis furnished with tables and chairs and books suited to its\r\nconstituents. Apart from this, all its management and spirit should\r\ncorrespond as closely as possible to that of the other departments. The\r\nsame dignity, the same freedom, the same courteous attention to every\r\nwant without fussy attentions which by grown people would be called\r\nintrusiveness should prevail. Make the selection of books what it should\r\nbe, provide guides and catalogs, perfectly clear but not patronizingly\r\nwritten down, show the children that you are always willing to respond\r\nin every way to their questions, and then--let them alone!\r\n\r\nSome one has asked me to speak on the question of discipline. After the\r\nfirst two or three weeks, if one begins properly, there will be no such\r\nquestion. Allowing something for the noise of small feet which have not\r\nlearned to control themselves as they will later on, and expecting more\r\n\"talking over\" an interesting \"find\" than is common with adults, one\r\nshould aim for library order. Teach the children what a library reading\r\nroom means. If in the first days there is a disposition on the part of\r\nany boy to be rough or unruly, or if a group of girls make a\r\nvisiting-and-gum-chewing rendezvous of your tables, don't waste any time\r\nin Sunday-school methods of discipline, trying to keep a hold on the\r\nchild at any cost to the library. A sentence in a report of Pratt\r\nInstitute children's room is worth adopting as a guiding principle. \"The\r\nwork of the children's room should be educative, not reformatory.\" Give\r\none decided warning and then if a child does not behave, send him out at\r\nonce. Do not be afraid of seeming stern at first. The fascinations of\r\nthe room are such that a child who has been turned away for disobedience\r\ncomes back a subdued and chastened young person and your best friend\r\nforever after; then with your aim and your firmness early settled, you\r\nwill have no more thought of discipline than the reference librarian\r\nwith his tables full of studious adults. After the first a little care\r\nabout the way a child enters the room will be all that is necessary.\r\nYour courteous manner, low tones, a little reminder about caps and clean\r\nhands while discharging his book, will give him the cue as to what is\r\nexpected, and he will have a pride in living up to what is expected of\r\nhim as a gentleman, not demanded of him as a child under authority.\r\n\r\nMany other points will engage the thought of the children's librarian,\r\nfor example, what shall be the attitude of the children's room toward\r\nthe other departments--whether it is to encourage the children to make\r\nuse of the adults' reference room, to take out cards in the main\r\ndelivery department, and get into the way of reading standard works from\r\nsuggestions of the children's librarian; or whether the line of\r\nseparation is to be rigid and she will be jealous of their \"graduating\"\r\nfrom her care. How to prepare the public, especially the school-teaching\r\npublic, for the opening, so as to secure their hearty co-operation from\r\nthe beginning is worth constant effort. The question of blanks and forms\r\nfor the children's room is a minor matter which is after all not a small\r\nthing. To make as few changes as possible in the forms already in use,\r\nso that any assistant from the main delivery room can in emergencies\r\nquickly take up the clerical work of the children's room without needing\r\nto learn a new routine may save much confusion should the children's\r\nstaff all happen to be stricken with grippe at the same time!\r\n\r\nBeginning early to plan, profiting by other people's mistakes, getting\r\nthe routine of each department at one's finger tips, foreseeing every\r\nprobable obstacle and removing each in imagination, beforehand,\r\nproceeding with calmness and common sense, thus the new machinery will\r\nmove as smoothly during opening weeks as if it had been running for\r\nyears, and, as \"well begun is half done,\" every thought given to\r\npreparation while the room exists only on paper will have a far-reaching\r\neffect on the permanent influences of the children's room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     REPORT ON GIFTS AND BEQUESTS TO AMERICAN LIBRARIES; 1900-1901.\r\n\r\n                         BY GEORGE WATSON COLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period covered by this report is from June 1, 1900, to July 1, 1901,\r\nand includes all gifts and bequests of $500 or more, as well as all\r\ngifts of 250 volumes and over, given by any single individual. A few\r\ngifts have been included which fall below these figures where the\r\nimportance or value of the gift seemed to require mention. This report\r\nhas been increased by the addition of over 50 gifts, information of\r\nwhich was received too late to be inserted before its presentation to\r\nthe Waukesha conference. A few others, which have been announced since\r\nJuly 1, have also been inserted.\r\n\r\nMuch of the information here given has been obtained by a careful\r\nexamination of the _Library Journal_ and _Public Libraries_.\r\nCommunications were sent to all the state library commissions, several\r\nstate library associations and clubs, and to the librarian of libraries\r\nknown to have 50,000 volumes or more. The responses to these\r\ncommunications have been quite general, and the information contained in\r\nthe replies has been embodied in this report. The thanks of the compiler\r\nare herewith extended to all who have assisted him in collecting the\r\nmaterial for this list.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested by Miss Hewins in 1896 that it would be desirable to\r\nhave the library commission of each state appoint some librarian, or\r\nlibrary trustee, who should be responsible for the collection of\r\ninformation regarding the gifts and bequests made within his state.\r\nJudging from the replies received this year the suggestion has never\r\nbeen carried out.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of my predecessor, I wish to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the suggestion, and would further recommend that the\r\ninformation so gathered be divided as nearly as possible into the\r\nfollowing classes:\r\n\r\n1. Buildings, giving value or cost;\r\n\r\n2. Sites, giving value or cost;\r\n\r\n3. Cash for buildings, with accompanying conditions, if any;\r\n\r\n4. Cash for sites, with accompanying conditions, if any;\r\n\r\n5. Books, pamphlets, periodicals, prints, maps, etc., giving number of\r\n    each kind, with value or cost of the whole, if known;\r\n\r\n6. Cash for books, etc., with accompanying conditions, if any;\r\n\r\n7. Cash for endowment funds, giving purpose for which income is to be\r\n    expended;\r\n\r\n8. Cash to be expended, with specified purposes for which it is to be\r\n    spent;\r\n\r\n9. Cash given unconditionally;\r\n\r\n10. Miscellaneous gifts, specifying their nature and value.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the first four of the above headings relate to\r\ngifts of real estate, which should also include gifts for fixtures of\r\nany kind, such as plants for lighting, heating, and ventilation; mural\r\ndecorations, such as frescoes; furniture, so constructed as to be an\r\nessential part of the building; landscape gardening, etc. The remaining\r\nheadings include books, endowment funds for various purposes (excepting\r\nbuilding funds and the other objects just mentioned), and gifts of money\r\nfor administration, current expenses, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThen, too, information should be given as to whether a gift has been\r\noffered, accepted, or received.\r\n\r\nIt seems desirable that information relating to such old and moribund\r\nlibraries as have been absorbed or merged with newer and more vigorous\r\ninstitutions should somewhere find a record. As such transfers are\r\nusually made as gifts, there seems to be no more suitable place for such\r\na record than in the annual report of Gifts and Bequests. It is to be\r\nhoped that, in the future, the tables of statistics issued from time to\r\ntime by the state library commissions, the U. S. Bureau of Education,\r\nand others will contain a record of the final disposition of such\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nIn the report of Gifts and Bequests made by Mr. Stockwell, a year ago,\r\ncovering a period of two years, there were given 458 separate gifts,\r\namounting to over $10,500,000, and distributed among 36 states and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. This report, covering 13 months, includes 482\r\nseparate gifts, amounting to $19,786,465.16, and is distributed as\r\nfollows: 468 in 39 of the United States, 10 in the British provinces,\r\nand three in Scotland. To that princely philanthropist, Mr. Andrew\r\nCarnegie, we are indebted, during the past year, for gifts reaching the\r\nenormous aggregate of $13,704,700, over $12,500,000 of which was given\r\nfor the erection of library buildings. In every case the gift, except\r\nwhere otherwise specified, was made upon the condition that the city or\r\ntown receiving it should furnish a site for the building and appropriate\r\nyearly for the maintenance of the library a sum equivalent to 10 per\r\ncent. of the gift.\r\n\r\nThe most notable gifts of the year are due to the ever-increasingly\r\ngenerous hand of Mr. Carnegie. That to the city of New York of\r\n$5,200,000, for the erection of 65, or more, branch libraries, is\r\nprobably the largest library gift ever made at one time to a single\r\ncity. His gift of $1,000,000 to the city of St. Louis for library\r\nbuildings and an equal sum, placed in trust as an endowment fund, for\r\nthe Carnegie libraries at Braddock, Duquesne, and Homestead, Pa., occupy\r\nthe second and third positions, by reason of their amounts. His recent\r\ngifts of $750,000 each to the cities of Detroit and San Francisco,\r\nthough announced since July 1, have been included in this report. Mr.\r\nCarnegie's gifts during the year number 121; 112 in the United States,\r\nsix in Canada, and three in Scotland. One hundred and seven of these\r\ngifts in the United States were for library buildings. Of the remaining\r\nfive, amounting to $1,028,000, one of $25,000 will probably be used for\r\na building.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the John Carter Brown Library to Brown University by the\r\ntrustees of the estate of the late John Nicholas Brown, recently\r\nannounced, is one of the most important library events of the year. This\r\nlibrary contains, if not the finest, at least one of the finest\r\ncollections of early Americana in this country, and possesses many books\r\nnot to be found in any other library on this side of the Atlantic. Its\r\ncollector, after whom it is named, was a competitor with Lenox, Brinley,\r\nand other early collectors of Americana for many a choice nugget which\r\nHenry Stevens and other European dealers had secured for their American\r\npatrons. The library is estimated to be worth at least $1,000,000, and\r\nthe gift carries with it two legacies, one of $150,000 for a library\r\nbuilding, and another of $500,000 as an endowment fund for its increase\r\nand maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe gift of four public-spirited citizens of St. Louis, who have jointly\r\ncontributed $400,000 to lift an incumbrance on the block to be used for\r\nthe new Carnegie library in that city, is a noble example of public\r\nspirit, and one of which the friends of that city may justly feel proud.\r\n\r\nThe collection of Oriental literature of Yale University has been\r\nenriched by the gift of 842 Arabic manuscripts, many of which are\r\nextremely rare. The collection covers the whole range of Arabic history\r\nand literature, dating back to the 12th and 13th centuries.\r\n\r\nThis collection, formed by Count Landberg, was purchased by Mr. Morris\r\nK. Jesup, of New York, at a cost of $20,000, and was presented by him to\r\nthe university library. This library has also received, as a bequest,\r\nthe private library of the late Prof. Othniel C. Marsh, consisting of\r\nabout 5000 volumes and 10,000 pamphlets, dealing mainly with\r\npalæontological subjects.\r\n\r\nThe New York Public Library--Astor, Lenox, and Tilden\r\nfoundations--through the generosity of Mr. Charles Stewart Smith, has\r\ncome into possession of a large and valuable collection of Japanese\r\nengravings and chromo-xylographs, formed by Captain Brinkley, of the\r\n_Japanese Mail_.\r\n\r\nI regret that I do not have the pleasure to record any addition, during\r\nthe year, to the Publication Fund of the American Library Association.\r\nThe Publishing Board is much hampered by lack of funds from carrying on\r\nits important work. If some philanthropically inclined person would\r\npresent a fund, say $100,000, upon condition that all publications\r\nissued from its income should bear the name of the fund, it would not\r\nonly be of inestimable benefit to the cause of libraries, but would also\r\nbe a most enduring monument to its donor.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the following list will disclose other gifts worthy\r\nof special mention if space permitted. The main list has been arranged\r\nalphabetically by states, as being the most convenient for reference. A\r\ntabulated summary, arranged by the geographical sections of the country,\r\nwill show how widely scattered have been the benefactions of the year,\r\nextending from Alabama in the south to Montreal in the north, and from\r\nBangor in the east to \"where rolls the Oregon\" in the far west.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  ALABAMA.\r\n\r\n  _Montgomery._ Public Library. Gift of $50,000, for a public library\r\n      building, from Andrew Carnegie.\r\n\r\n  -- Gift of books forming its library, from the Montgomery Library\r\n      Association.\r\n\r\n  _Tuskegee._ Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute.

PUBLISHING BOARD.\r\n\r\n BY JOSEPH L. HARRISON, _Treasurer, Librarian of The Providence (R. I.)\r\n                               Athenæum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the requirement of the constitution I have the honor\r\nto present herewith the report of the Publishing Board for the year\r\n1900. The table of the financial operations of the board is essentially\r\na trial balance, but divided into two sections to bring out more clearly\r\nthe condition of the board's undertakings. The first section shows in\r\nthe last two columns the net balance of loss or profit on each of our\r\npublications, June, 1901. In general it is true that our book\r\npublications, except the \"List of subject headings,\" have not brought in\r\nwhat was expended on them, while our card publications have more than\r\noffset these losses by their profits, for although the final balance of\r\nall these accounts shows an excess of expenditures over receipts of\r\n$830.74, yet it should be noticed that the two largest items in the\r\nexpense column, $476.84 and $1290.02 are on account of publications\r\nwhich have not yet begun to bring many returns, viz., the second edition\r\nof the \"A. L. A. index\" and the \"Portrait index.\" If these are left out\r\nof consideration our other publications show a net profit to date of\r\n$927.12. The second section of the table shows what means we have in\r\nhand or can count upon. The unpaid bills ($241.69 + $369.52 + $16.50),\r\n$627.71, are just about offset by the amount of bills and subscriptions\r\ndue us, $636.82; leaving the cash balance, $823.64, plus the amount sunk\r\nin publications, $830.74, to represent the sum still remaining in our\r\nhands of money appropriated to our use by the trustees of the Endowment\r\nFund or received from other sources, $1617.08, plus the sum of the\r\nbalances still standing on the old membership accounts, $46.41. It\r\nshould be remembered that the office expenses of the year having been\r\nheavier than usual, over $1800, have not been all charged to the account\r\nof our different publications, but a balance of $345.55 has been allowed\r\nto remain, reducing by so much the balance on this account of the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nAs a complement and supplement to the table the following statements\r\nconcerning the board's publications and work may be of interest:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Books._\r\n\r\n_A. L. A. proceedings._--The board has in stock at its headquarters,\r\n10-1/2 Beacon street, Boston, nearly 2000 copies of the conference\r\nproceedings, covering the years from 1882 to date. There are a very\r\nlimited number of copies of the years 1882, 1886, 1892, and 1893, and it\r\nis suggested that libraries desiring to complete sets in order to bind\r\nthe proceedings by themselves would do well to give the matter early\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n_Annotated bibliography of fine art._--The \"Bibliography of fine art,\"\r\nprepared by Mr. Sturgis and Mr. Krehbiel and edited by Mr. Iles, which\r\nhas become so favorably known because of the value of its descriptive,\r\ncritical and comparative notes, was among the board's publications\r\ntransferred to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., of Boston (now the\r\nregular publishers of the board), in January, 1900, and may be obtained\r\ndirectly from them. The sales of the book, last year amounting to 84\r\ncopies, are gradually reducing the deficit incurred in its publication,\r\nwhich at the end of the year amounted to less than $400.\r\n\r\n_Books for boys and girls._--The little, inexpensive, paper-covered\r\nhandbook which bears this title, with its carefully annotated lists,\r\nprepared by Miss Hewins, of the Hartford Public Library, for the home\r\nuse of fathers, mothers and teachers, continues in such active demand\r\nthat less than 700 copies are now left of an original edition of 3000.\r\nIt remains in the hands of the Publishing Board.\r\n\r\n_Library tracts._--Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have published for\r\nthe board during the year three library primers, an edition of 1000 of\r\neach tract being printed. The first, \"Why do we need a public library?\"\r\nwas compiled by a committee of the A. L. A. This was followed by \"How to\r\nstart a public library,\" by Dr. G. E. Wire, of the Worcester County Law\r\nLibrary, and \"Travelling libraries,\" by Mr. Frank A. Hutchins, secretary\r\nof the Wisconsin Free Library Commission. They have been well received,\r\nand others on practical library subjects will follow as soon as\r\npossible. A very low price has been fixed for the tracts, and it is\r\nhoped that they will be generously used by clubs, commissions and\r\nindividuals interested in promoting the advancement of library\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n_List of books for girls and women and their clubs._--This carefully\r\nselected list of some 2100 books \"worthy to be read or studied by girls\r\nand women\" should now be ordered directly of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin &\r\nCo. Nearly 300 copies, including parts, were sold during the year,\r\nshowing a continued though not increased demand.\r\n\r\n_List of French fiction._--Nearly 1000 copies of this convenient list,\r\nchosen and annotated by Madame Cornu, of Montreal, and Mr. Beer, of New\r\nOrleans, were sold during the year, reducing the stock on hand at the\r\nboard's Beacon street office, where it can still be obtained, to less\r\nthan 500 copies.\r\n\r\n_List of subject headings for use in dictionary catalogs._--\"Subject\r\nheadings\" continues to be one of the most lucrative publications of the\r\nboard. Nearly 300 copies were sold in 1900, and the accounts of the year\r\nshow a balance in its favor of nearly $500. Since the demand for the\r\nbook comes almost exclusively from libraries, it still remains in the\r\nhands of the Library Bureau, where orders should be sent.\r\n\r\n_Reading for the young._--Sargent's \"Reading for the young\" is offered\r\nby Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. in three forms: the original edition,\r\ncompiled by Mr. John F. Sargent; the \"Supplement,\" compiled by Miss Mary\r\nE. and Miss Abby L. Sargent; and the original and supplement bound\r\ntogether. During the current year the original edition has become\r\nexhausted. It is probable that a limited number of copies will be\r\nprinted at once to supply the immediate demand and that a reprint, with\r\nadditional matter, will be undertaken in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Printed cards._\r\n\r\n_Current books._--It need simply be stated under the head of \"Printed\r\ncards for current books\" that the entire reorganization of this part of\r\nthe board's work has been the subject of active discussion during the\r\nyear, and that the proposed plans for carrying it on more effectively\r\nwill be fully explained to the conference by Mr. Fletcher, chairman of\r\nthe Publishing Board. It may be appropriately added that, as in past\r\nyears, the thanks of the Association are due to the publishers for their\r\ncourtesy in sending books, and to Miss Browne for her earnest work in\r\ngetting the cards to subscribers with--under often adverse\r\nconditions--most commendable promptness.\r\n\r\n_English history._--The annotated cards on English history continue to\r\nbe printed at a loss. Mr. W. D. Johnston has been re-engaged, however,\r\nto edit the cards for the current year, and it is hoped that in the end\r\ntheir usefulness will be found to justify the work, at least to the\r\nextent of making them self-supporting.\r\n\r\n_Periodical and society publications._--The Publishing Board is now\r\nprinting cards for nearly 250 periodical and society publications.\r\nDuring 1900, 2843 titles, or more than 170,000 cards, were sent out.\r\nThis represents the largest single item of the board's work and an\r\nexpenditure of more than $1700, which is nearly met by receipts from the\r\nsales.\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous sets._--The board has now printed 16 of the so-called\r\n\"Miscellaneous sets,\" which are, together with the years or volumes\r\ncovered, as follows: American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience--Proceedings, 1875-1898; American Historical\r\nAssociation--Papers, 1885-91, v. 1-5; American Historical\r\nAssociation--Reports, 1889-98; New York State Museum--Bulletin, 1892-98,\r\nnos. 1-23; Massachusetts Historical Society--Collections, 1792-1899; Old\r\nSouth Leaflets--series 1-4; Smithsonian Institution--Annual reports,\r\n1886-96; Smithsonian Institution--Contributions to knowledge, 1862-97;\r\nSmithsonian Institution--Miscellaneous collections, 1862-97; U. S.\r\nBureau of Ethnology--Annual reports, 1879-95; U. S. National\r\nMuseum--Annual reports, 1886-95; U. S. National Museum--Bulletin,\r\n1875-98, and (books) Depew, \"One hundred years of American commerce\";\r\nAuthors Club, \"Liber scriptorum\"; Shaler, \"United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThese sets simply cover the back numbers of what are now grouped in the\r\nboard's work as \"periodicals and society publications\"--completed works\r\nlike \"Liber scriptorum,\" of course, being excepted. Subscriptions to\r\nthese periodicals and publications as current continuations begin with\r\nthe date of the receipt of the subscription, so that unless one has been\r\na subscriber from the beginning there will of necessity (because of the\r\nlimited number of the cards printed) be a break between the last year\r\ncovered by the \"Miscellaneous set\" and the beginning of the\r\nsubscription.\r\n\r\nThe sets have met with a warm welcome from the libraries, and the board\r\nis prepared to print cards during 1901 for the following additional\r\nsets, providing a sufficient number of orders are received to justify\r\nthe work: American Academy of Political and Social Science--Annals, 1900\r\nto date; American Economic Association--Economic studies, 1896-97;\r\nAmerican Economic Association--Publications, 1887-96; _Bibliographica_,\r\n1895-97; Bureau of American Republics--Publications; Columbia University\r\nStudies in History, Economy and Public Law, 1891-96; Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity Studies in History and Political Science, 1883-98; U. S.\r\nGeological Survey--Bulletins, 1884-98; U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey--Monographs, 1882-98; U. S. Geological and Geographical Survey of\r\nthe Territories--Reports, 1875-90; U. S. Geological and Geographical\r\nSurvey of the Territories--Miscellaneous publications, 12 nos.\r\n\r\nThese brief statements show concisely the bibliographical work which the\r\nPublishing Board has completed and is now carrying on, and for which it\r\nneeds the continued moral and financial support of the libraries of the\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _In preparation and under consideration._\r\n\r\nOther important work is in active progress. The \"Literature of American\r\nhistory,\" being edited by Mr. Larned, and for which Mr. Iles has so\r\ngenerously donated $10,000, is well along, and may be announced as a\r\nfall book. Under Mr. Fletcher's direction work on the second edition of\r\nthe \"A. L. A. index\" has advanced rapidly, and the book will be ready\r\nfor distribution before the end of the year. Mr. Dewey has promised that\r\nthe long-delayed \"Supplement\" to the \"A. L. A. catalog,\" being edited,\r\nas was the original, by Mrs. Salome Cutler Fairchild, will be out this\r\nsummer. It is expected that active work on the \"Portrait index\" will be\r\ncontinued, and that under the editorship of Mr. Lane and Miss Browne the\r\nindex will be pushed to rapid completion.\r\n\r\nAmong the pieces of valuable work under consideration, on which the\r\nboard hopes soon to be able to take final and definite action, may be\r\nmentioned Mr. Teggart's \"Handbook of libraries of the United States,\" an\r\n\"Index to library periodicals,\" a \"Bibliography of reference books,\"\r\ncards to current books recommended by the Wisconsin Free Library\r\nCommission and the Massachusetts Library Club index to the Massachusetts\r\npublic documents.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it remains to express the deep and sincere regret with\r\nwhich the board accepted the resignation of Mr. William C. Lane as its\r\nsecretary and treasurer, tendered in December of last year on account of\r\nill health and after a long period of most earnest, faithful and\r\nvaluable service, and to repeat here the suggestion with which he closed\r\nhis report to the Montreal conference, a suggestion made, it must be\r\nremembered, after years of closest attention to the workings of the\r\nboard:\r\n\r\n\"The desirability of taking some definite steps toward putting the work\r\nof the Publishing Board on a broader and stronger basis is as evident as\r\never. In addition to the efficient service rendered by the assistant\r\nsecretary, the Publishing Board could with advantage employ a portion,\r\nsay half, of the time of a capable man who should combine business\r\njudgment and alertness with bibliographical tastes and knowledge of\r\nlibrary interests. The time has come when both for its own sake and in\r\njustice to those who serve it the Publishing Board should have salaried\r\nofficers. To make the change successfully, however, requires a better\r\nfinancial condition than it yet has.\"\r\n\r\n  ======================================================\r\n  STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS, JANUARY 1 TO DECEMBER 31, 1900.\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------\r\n                            |               |          |\r\n                            |     Copies    |  Copies  |\r\n        PUBLICATIONS.       |      sold     | on hand  |\r\n                            |       in      | Dec. 31, |\r\n                            |      1900.    |   1900.  |\r\n                            |               |          |\r\n  --------------------------+---------------+----------|\r\n  A.

The president then introduced ANDREW J.\r\nFRAME, of Waukesha, who extended a cordial welcome to Waukesha on behalf\r\nof the local committee, referring to the advance made in library\r\ndevelopment throughout Wisconsin, largely through the efforts of such\r\nmen as Senator Stout, of Menominee, and Z. G. Simmons, of Kenosha, and\r\nthe enthusiasm of the state commission.\r\n\r\nMR. CARR then delivered the\r\n                          PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe subject\r\n                     WHAT MAY BE DONE FOR LIBRARIES\r\nwas presented by three speakers, T.

It provides that in section\r\n17, line 10, of the constitution the words \"of the association,\" shall\r\nbe stricken out, thus making the final sentence of that section read as\r\nfollows: \"It may, by a two-thirds vote, promulgate recommendations\r\nrelating to library matters, and no resolutions except votes of thanks\r\nand on local arrangements shall be otherwise promulgated.\"\r\n\r\nF. W. FAXON presented his\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECRETARY'S REPORT.\r\n\r\nDuring the 13 months since the Association met at Montreal the number of\r\nnew members added has been 167.[C] Including with the new those who have\r\nrejoined (for they are practically new members), we have over 225, the\r\nlargest year's increase in the history of the A. L. A. The system of\r\ngiving to each person who joins an accession number, and after a lapse\r\nof membership for one or more years reverting to the old number when he\r\nagain joins, is not to my mind quite fair to the regular continued\r\nmembership. One of the charter members, to take an extreme case, may,\r\nafter paying dues for 1876 only, come in again this year by paying for\r\n1901 and yet appear on a par with the 1876 members who have faithfully\r\nkept up their membership for 25 years. Those rejoining members should be\r\nincluded with the total of new names added. There is a chance here for\r\nour statistician to devise a better system of accession. In March, 1901,\r\nthe active membership reached the 1000 mark, an achievement which may\r\nwell be recorded at the opening of a new century.\r\n\r\nIn January 4000 copies of preliminary announcements were mailed to\r\nmembers, and others supposed to be interested. The secretary compiled\r\nfor this purpose a card catalog of names, including in it members of\r\nall the state associations and local clubs.\r\n\r\nIn May a new handbook (68 pages and cover) 3-1/4 × 5-3/4 in.,\r\npractically following the size of last issue, was sent out, giving list\r\nof members, officers and committees, statistical tables, lists of state\r\nand local library associations and state library commissions, necrology\r\nfor the year, and other information of value to members and of use in\r\nextending the work of the A. L. A.\r\n\r\nAn edition of 4500 was printed at an expense of $160.60, and about half\r\nwere mailed, in connection with circular no. 2 regarding the Waukesha\r\nmeeting. The remainder should suffice for the coming year, with a small\r\nsupplement to include the new members, and the by-laws to be passed at\r\nWaukesha, thus completing the new constitution.\r\n\r\nEarly in June the final announcement was sent out, with private post\r\ncard enclosed, requesting advance registration. This was entirely\r\nsuccessful, 476 persons registering for attendance, up to June 28. A\r\nprinted list of these, for distribution at the early sessions of the\r\nmeeting, will, it is confidently expected, more than justify the expense\r\nof its compilation. (800 copies, 24 pages, same size as handbook,\r\n$32.75.)\r\n\r\n2000 copies of program (16 pages, handbook size) were printed and a copy\r\nmailed to each person who registered for attendance at the meeting, and\r\nto all members of the Association.\r\n\r\nThe secretary's expenses for the year, exclusive of handbook, will be\r\nabout $400, the chief items being postage and printing. This seems\r\njustified, as it has been the means of increasing the income of the A.\r\nL. A. by more than the amount expended.\r\n\r\nNumber of letters and postcards written during the year 956, number\r\nreceived about 1000.\r\n\r\nGifts to the A. L. A. during the year have included:\r\n\r\nCurrent issues of the New York Public Library _Bulletin_, and the\r\n_Library Journal_, from the publishers.\r\n\r\nReports of the Bristol meeting of the L. A. U. K., from the Honorable\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nReport of the trustees of the Public Library of Victoria, Australia,\r\n1900.\r\n\r\nCatalogue of books on art, from the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Library.\r\n\r\nStatistics of labor, Conn., Report, 1901.\r\n\r\n_World_ Almanac, 1901.\r\n\r\nAnnual reports of several American libraries, including Philadelphia\r\nFree, Haverhill Public, Somerville Public, and Bowdoin College\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nIn closing I wish to thank all upon whom I have called for information\r\nor help, for the promptness and cordiality of their response.\r\n\r\n                     GARDNER M.

Miss Angell graduated from the Pratt\r\nInstitute Library School in 1896 and was a member of the Pratt Institute\r\nLibrary staff until July, 1897. From Dec., 1897, to the time of her\r\ndeath she was assistant librarian of the American Society of Civil\r\nEngineers.\r\n\r\n2. Hon. Mellen Chamberlain (A. L.

He was graduated from Dartmouth College in 1844,\r\ntaught school at Brattleboro, Vt., entered the Harvard Law School in\r\n1846, was graduated and admitted to the bar in 1849. In the same year he\r\ntook up his residence in Chelsea and began the practice of law in\r\nBoston. He held several municipal offices and was a member of both\r\nhouses of the state legislature. From 1866 to 1870 he was an associate\r\njustice of the Municipal Court of Boston, then chief justice of the same\r\ncourt until his resignation in 1878. He was librarian of the Boston\r\nPublic Library from Oct. 1, 1878, to Oct. 1, 1890. During his\r\nadministration the library's collection of Americana was largely\r\nincreased and the preliminary plans for the new building were developed.\r\nThe remainder of his life was devoted to literary and historical work.\r\nJudge Chamberlain was recognized as one of the foremost students of\r\nAmerican colonial history and his collection of autographic documents\r\nrelating to American history was one of the finest in the country. This\r\ncollection was deposited in the Boston Public Library in 1893 and became\r\nits property on the death of Judge Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n(_See \"Brief description of the Chamberlain collection of autographs,\"\r\npublished by the Boston Public Library._)\r\n\r\n3. Henry Barnard (A. L. A. no. 104, 1877.) Born in Hartford, Ct., Jan.\r\n24, 1811; died July 5, 1900. He graduated from Yale College in 1830 and\r\nin 1835 was admitted to the bar. From 1837-40 he was a member of the\r\nConnecticut legislature and during his term of service advocated reforms\r\nin insane asylums, prisons and the common schools. From 1838 to 1842 he\r\nwas secretary of the board of school commissioners in Connecticut; from\r\n1842 to 1849 school commissioner of Rhode Island; from 1850 to 1854\r\nstate superintendent of the Connecticut schools, and from 1857 to 1859\r\npresident of the State University of Wisconsin. From 1865 to 1867 he was\r\npresident of St. John's College, and from 1867 to 1870 U. S.\r\nCommissioner of Education. He wrote and compiled many educational books\r\nand edited several educational periodicals, the most important being the\r\n_American Journal of Education_. In 1886 he published a collected\r\nedition of his works comprising 52 volumes and over 800 original\r\ntreatises. Dr. Barnard received the degree of LL.D. from Yale and Union\r\nin 1851 and from Harvard in 1852. He was always greatly interested in\r\nlibraries. In 1823 or 1824 he served as assistant librarian and made his\r\nfirst donation to the library of Monson Academy, and from 1828 to 1830\r\nwas librarian of the Linonian Society of Yale College, giving twice the\r\namount of the small salary back to the library in books. During his\r\nconnection with the legislature and common schools of Connecticut, 1837\r\nto 1842, the district school library system was established and the\r\npower of taxation for libraries was given to every school society in the\r\nstate. During his sojourn in Rhode Island he started a library in every\r\ntown in the state. He joined the A. L. A. in 1877, and was made an\r\nhonorary member at Chicago in 1893. He attended the conferences of 1876,\r\n1877, and 1893.\r\n\r\n(\"_National cyclopedia of American biography,\" vol. I; L. J._, 4:289.)\r\n\r\n4. Enos L. Doan (A. L. A. no. 1909, 1899), librarian of the Wilmington\r\n(Del.) Institute Free Library. Born in Indiana about 40 years ago; died\r\nin Wilmington, Dec. 18, 1900. He was a graduate of Haverford College and\r\nwas for several years connected with the Friends' School in Wilmington,\r\nfirst as teacher and later as assistant principal and principal. In the\r\nspring of 1899 he resigned that office to accept the appointment of\r\nlibrarian of the Wilmington Institute Free Library. He had previously\r\nbeen active in the development of the library, and as chairman of the\r\nlibrary committee had aided in the reorganization of the former\r\nsubscription library into a free public library.\r\n\r\n                                                (_L.

Born near Lynchburg, Va., Sept. 29, 1848; died in\r\nNew York City, Dec. 20, 1900. His father, E. N. Wing, was engineer of\r\nthe East Tenn. and Va. R. R. He was a Union man and after the siege of\r\nKnoxville removed to New York City. Here young Wing attended the public\r\nschools and entered the College of the City of New York, but before the\r\nclose of the first year he became a clerk in the Mercantile Library. He\r\nwas connected with the library for 13 years and became first assistant\r\nlibrarian, but his unceasing work and devotion to details injured his\r\nhealth and he was obliged to retire from active work. In 1880 he took\r\ncharge of the library department of Charles Scribner's Sons, for which\r\nhis library training well fitted him. In April, 1899, he was elected\r\nchief librarian of the New York Free Circulating Library. During the\r\nyears he was in the book business Mr. Wing kept in close touch with\r\nlibrary interests. He was a member of the A. L. A. for 14 years, and was\r\nalmost from its beginning an active member of the New York Library Club.\r\nHe had been treasurer of the New York Library Association for seven\r\nyears, holding that office at the time of his death. He was also\r\nprominent in book trade organizations and in various civic reform\r\nmovements in New York City. He was always ready to give help and service\r\nin any good cause and he will be missed by many friends among librarians\r\nand bookbuyers.\r\n\r\n(_Publishers' Weekly, Dec. 29, 1900; L. J., Jan., 1901._)\r\n\r\n6. Huntington Wolcott Jackson (A. L. A. no. 884, 1890), president board\r\nof directors of the John Crerar Library. Born in Newark, N. J., Jan. 28,\r\n1841; died in Chicago, Jan. 3, 1901. He attended Phillips Academy,\r\nAndover, Mass., and entered Princeton College. At the end of his junior\r\nyear he enlisted in the army, where he secured rapid promotion. After a\r\nyear at the Harvard Law School and a year spent in European travel and\r\nstudy, he finished his studies in Chicago and was admitted to the bar in\r\n1868. He practiced law in Chicago and in 1888 was elected president of\r\nthe Chicago Bar Association. Mr. Jackson was a warm and trusted friend\r\nof the late John Crerar. At Mr. Crerar's death he was, with Mr. Norman\r\nWilliams, one of the executors of the will and a co-trustee of the John\r\nCrerar Library, then to be founded. For many years Mr. Jackson was\r\nchairman of the committee on administration and practically all of the\r\ndetails of administration were passed upon by him and some quite\r\nimportant changes were made by him. Mr. Jackson was a member of the A.\r\nL. A. from 1890 until his death, but there is no record of his\r\nattendance at any conference.\r\n\r\n                          (_See Report of John Crerar Library, 1900._)\r\n\r\n7. Robert Crossman Ingraham (A. L. A. no. 205, 1879), librarian of the\r\nNew Bedford (Mass.) Free Public Library. Born in New Bedford, Feb. 11,\r\n1827; died there March 3, 1901. The New Bedford Free Public Library was\r\ninstituted in 1852 and Mr. Ingraham was chosen its first librarian, then\r\ntaking up the work to which he gave nearly half a century. Under his\r\nmanagement the library grew from its nucleus of 5500 volumes to 72,000\r\nvolumes, and the strength and good proportions of the collection are due\r\nto his scholarship, unsparing labor, and discernment of local needs. For\r\nmany years Mr. Ingraham had little or no assistance in the library, yet\r\nfor more than 30 years he cataloged every book added to its shelves. He\r\nkept in touch with changes in library administration and was not\r\nprevented by conservatism from adopting those which his good judgment\r\napproved. Mr. Ingraham was a man of retiring disposition and simple\r\ntastes, a hard student with a marvellous memory. In addition to his\r\ngreat fund of general information, and knowledge of the books in his\r\nlibrary, he was thoroughly posted in everything relating to the history\r\nof New Bedford, and had few equals in his knowledge of mosses and\r\nliverworts. He devoted his life to his library and his fund of erudition\r\nwas always at the service of every one who sought his assistance.\r\n\r\n            (_See W. R. L. Gifford in L.

A. no. 1973, 1900), for the last 10\r\nyears secretary-treasurer and librarian of the Fraser Institute Free\r\nPublic Library, of Montreal, died April 11, 1901. Mr. Malcouronne will\r\nbe pleasantly remembered by many who attended the Montreal conference.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer's report was accepted.\r\n\r\nC. C. Soule read the\r\n\r\n\r\n             REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE ENDOWMENT FUND.\r\n\r\n        _To the Secretary of the American Library Association._\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a report of the receipts and expenditures from the\r\ndate of last report, June 6, 1900, to July 1, 1901, together with a\r\nschedule of assets, and an estimate of income for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThere are no donations to report. The permanent fund has been increased\r\nby the fees for three (3) life memberships, $75 in all.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1901, the mortgagor on a loan of $1000, bearing interest at\r\nsix per cent., and falling due Aug. 1, 1903, asked leave to pay off the\r\nmortgage. He was allowed to do so on paying $53.97, being the difference\r\nbetween the six per cent. he was to have paid, up to maturity of the\r\nmortgage, and the four per cent. which the trustees can expect to get on\r\nreinvestment of the $1000 repaid. This repayment to the fund has been\r\nkept in bank until after this conference. If not needed by the\r\nPublishing Board as a loan, it can be invested at, say, four per cent.\r\nOf the $2102.18 now on deposit, subject to check, $655.04 is on interest\r\naccount, available for expenditure as the Council may direct. (In\r\naddition to this, $301.03 income may be expected during the year\r\n1901-2.) $1437.14 is on principal account to be invested as opportunity\r\noffers.\r\n\r\n                                                   CHARLES C.

BOLTON }  _Finance Committee_\r\n\r\nMr. SOULE: In submitting this report, I would call the attention of the\r\nAssociation to the fact that the permanent fund is not as large as it\r\nought to be. If you will remember, the attempt at collection, made with\r\nmuch vigor at first, had to be abandoned on account of general financial\r\ntrouble through the country. No systematic effort has since been made to\r\nincrease the fund. The work of the Association would be very much\r\nfurthered if this fund were large enough to provide $5000 or $6000 of\r\nincome, so that the Association could have two or three, or one or two,\r\npermanent paid officers, with a good allowance for travelling and\r\nincidental expenses. If any of you should be asked where an amount of\r\nsay $100,000 could be placed with advantage to the general library\r\ncause, I hope you will bear in mind the inadequate funds of the\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThe report was accepted.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of W. L. R. GIFFORD, chairman, the secretary read the\r\n\r\n\r\n                 REPORT OF THE CO-OPERATION COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustive report on co-operative cataloging rendered by the\r\nCo-operation Committee of last year has disposed for the present, so far\r\nas this committee is concerned, of the most important subject which has\r\nof late years been brought to its attention.\r\n\r\nDr. Richardson reports that the index to theological periodicals is\r\nprogressing rapidly, and will probably be published before the next\r\nconference of the A. L. A. The index will cover the years 1891-1900, and\r\nwill include all the standard theological periodicals, of Poole rank and\r\nupwards, in all languages of which there are representatives in American\r\nlibraries, together with many references to theological articles in\r\ngeneral periodicals, in all not less than 25,000 references. It will be\r\nan alphabetical subject index like Poole, but will differ from Poole in\r\ngiving regular author-title entry, and will be more bibliographical in\r\ncharacter through the select references to general periodicals. A\r\nfeature of the index will be a very brief definition of each subject.\r\nDr. Richardson has at present seven clerks engaged in the work, and is\r\npushing it as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nThe dictionary of historical fiction, in preparation by the Free Library\r\nof Philadelphia, is making satisfactory progress, and will probably be\r\nissued within the coming year. Since the announcement was made at the\r\nAtlanta conference that this dictionary was in preparation there have\r\nbeen many inquiries concerning it, and the prospect of its publication\r\nwill be welcome.\r\n\r\nThe committee has received no new information during the past year in\r\nregard to plans for bibliographical work, and it would emphasize the\r\nrecommendations of previous years that all such plans be reported\r\npromptly to the committee, so that they may be published in its annual\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n                                    WILLIAM L. R. GIFFORD, _Chairman_.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of C. H. GOULD, chairman, C. W. ANDREWS read the\r\n\r\n\r\n               REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN DOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe committee begs to report, with considerable confidence, that this is\r\npositively its last appearance in connection with the list of French\r\ngovernment serials, which has been long in course of compilation and\r\npublication. This work is now in its final stage, and as it will soon be\r\nin the hands of the reviewer, to say much in regard to it at present\r\nseems hardly necessary. Two points, however, require a word:\r\n\r\n1. Recognizing the difficulties in the way of attaining anything like\r\ncompleteness in an enumeration of this nature, the committee\r\ndeliberately decided to omit certain documents in favor of others. Thus\r\nit happens that no reference is made to the legislative proceedings of\r\nthe several Revolutionary Assemblies, nor to other publications of equal\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n2. In addition to enumerating documents, this list indicates particular\r\nlibraries where they may be consulted. It was, of course, unnecessary,\r\neven had it been possible, to mention all the libraries in the country\r\nwhich possess sets more or less complete. But it is hoped that the\r\nlibraries chosen are so widely distributed as to save a would-be reader\r\nfrom undertaking a long journey when a shorter one would serve.\r\n\r\nSuch other features as call for notice will be referred to in the\r\npreface.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be unbecoming if the committee failed now to\r\nrecognize and thank Miss Adelaide R. Hasse for the pains and labor she\r\nhas bestowed upon the list. She has co-operated with the committee from\r\nthe first, and to her and to Mr. Andrews the committee is under special\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nThe committee would further report that it now has on hand a\r\nconsiderable amount of raw material for a German list similar to the\r\nFrench; and it is hoped that progress may be made in arranging this\r\nduring the present summer.\r\n\r\n                        Respectfully submitted,\r\n                                              C.

They, therefore, submit as their report the accompanying\r\ndraft of such a note, with the recommendation that it be sent to the\r\npublishers of all leading periodicals, and that a committee on this\r\nsubject be continued, to receive and act upon any correspondence that\r\nmay be called out.\r\n\r\n                                         THORVALD SOLBERG, }\r\n                                                           }_Committee_.\r\n                                         W. I. FLETCHER,   }\r\n\r\n_Note to publishers of periodicals, as to the furnishing in proper form\r\nof title-pages and contents. This note was drawn up by a Committee of\r\nthe American Library Association and was approved by the Association._\r\n\r\nAs a result of much dissatisfaction among librarians with the\r\nirregularities and uncertainties connected with the issue, by publishers\r\nof periodicals, of title-pages and \"contents\" of volumes, the American\r\nLibrary Association has had a special committee considering the subject\r\nwith a view to drawing up a suitable memorial to be presented to such\r\npublishers, looking to the securing of more uniformity and propriety in\r\nthis matter. After mature consideration the committee have prepared the\r\nfollowing recommendations as embodying the minimum of improvement which\r\nmay reasonably be hoped for.\r\n\r\n 1. Title-pages and tables of contents should always accompany _the\r\n number completing a volume_, and not the first number of a new volume.\r\n [They should be _stitched in, and not sent loose_.] There are several\r\n cogent reasons for this recommendation:\r\n\r\n (_a_) In many cases it is a serious detriment to the usefulness of a\r\n set in a library, if a completed volume cannot be bound until the\r\n receipt of the next number.\r\n\r\n (_b_) More important is the need that the numbers of a volume shall\r\n constitute the volume in its entirety, so that as they are bought and\r\n sold there shall not be the necessity of handling also another number\r\n belonging to a different volume in order to complete the first. Now\r\n that libraries are buying periodical sets and volumes in such large\r\n numbers for use with Poole's and other indexes, it is of great\r\n importance to the book trade, as well as librarians, and must have a\r\n real bearing on the business interests of the publishers, that this\r\n matter, often trifled with, shall receive due attention. Publishers\r\n must come to feel that if it is necessary (which it generally proves\r\n not to be) to delay a completing number a day or two in its issue in\r\n order to insure its completeness in this respect, the delay is\r\n abundantly compensated for.\r\n\r\n 2. Title-pages and contents should be furnished _with every copy_ of\r\n the issue of a completing number. We earnestly believe that by\r\n inserting title-pages and contents in all cases publishers will at once\r\n put a premium on the preservation and binding of their magazines,\r\n suggesting it to many who otherwise would not think of it. In the long\r\n run the demand for back numbers to make up volumes must more than\r\n compensate for the extra expense of putting in the additional leaves.\r\n\r\n The policy of sending title-pages and contents only to those calling\r\n for them is suicidal, as it results in flooding the market with numbers\r\n from which volumes cannot be made up and by destroying the hope of\r\n making up sets weakens the demand which would otherwise exist for\r\n volumes and numbers of the periodical in question.\r\n\r\n If an alphabetical index, in addition to a table of contents, is\r\n furnished, which is the preferable practice, the former should be paged\r\n to go at the end of the volume. When such an index is furnished, and no\r\n table of contents, the index should be printed to follow the\r\n title-page.\r\n\r\n 3. As to the form in which title-pages and contents should be issued:\r\n they should be printed on a two-, four-, or eight-leaved section,\r\n separate from other printed matter, either advertising or reading.\r\n Nothing is more important in binding volumes to stand the hard wear of\r\n our public libraries than that none of the earlier leaves in the volume\r\n shall be single leaves pasted in. One of the greatest abuses of the\r\n book trade at present is the disposition to have title and other\r\n preliminary leaves pasted in. Librarians find to their cost (what is\r\n not so obvious to the book manufacturer) that this does not work. An\r\n absolute requirement for good bookmaking is that the first and last\r\n portions of the book especially shall be good solid sections--no single\r\n leaves, nor do most librarians or owners of private libraries like to\r\n include advertisements, in order to secure these solid sections for\r\n binding. We feel sure that it is abundantly worth while for the\r\n publishers to squarely meet this demand.\r\n\r\n 4. Admitting that there may be cases in which it is practically\r\n impossible to furnish title and contents with the completing number of\r\n a volume, we would recommend for such cases that such a separate\r\n section as has been described be made and furnished with the first\r\n number of the new volume, stitched in _at its end_, not at its\r\n beginning. The last-named practice is likely to cause more trouble to\r\n librarians than any other that is common, as it is difficult to remove\r\n the section without making the number unfit to place in the reading\r\n room.\r\n\r\n We would like to call the attention of periodical publishers to the\r\n difficulties arising from the common practice of printing some first or\r\n last leaves of reading matter on the same section with some pages of\r\n advertising. Most librarians prefer to remove the advertising leaves\r\n before binding the magazines. The practice referred to makes it\r\n necessary to bind in some advertising leaves or else take off and paste\r\n in single leaves of reading matter, sometimes three or four in one\r\n place, which is very inimical to good binding. Publishers are advised\r\n to have all advertising pages printed on separate sections if possible.\r\n\r\n Desiring to meet, so far as possible, the views of publishers in regard\r\n to the matters referred to above, the committee will be pleased to hear\r\n from any to whom this note may come.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: The committee have corresponded with some of the magazine\r\npublishers, and if any are disposed to consider what is here proposed an\r\nideal system, your attention may be called to the fact that several of\r\nour magazine publishers are carrying it out. For instance, Houghton,\r\nMifflin & Co.--I am not mentioning them as superior to others; others\r\nmight be mentioned--but in their reply to a tentative letter Houghton,\r\nMifflin & Co. say that \"in all of our publications every one of these\r\nrecommendations is strictly carried out.\" They took pride in replying to\r\nus that they believed they were doing exactly what we wanted--and\r\nseveral other publishers.\r\n\r\nG. M. JONES: I understand the report to recommend that title-pages and\r\nindexes be fastened into the last number of the volume. Now it seems\r\nthat in many cases it would be very much better to have them left loose.\r\nThe case is this: In almost all public libraries of any size periodicals\r\nare put into some kind of a binder. On many accounts binders which\r\nperforate are the best, but we do not wish to perforate title-page and\r\nindex, if we can help it, especially the title-page, and I would like to\r\ninquire why the committee considered it so essential that the title-page\r\nand index should be fastened into the number?\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: These questions were all considered by the committee, and\r\nI would say when I first drew up my suggestion on this point it was that\r\ntitle-page and index should be sent loose; but I found an overwhelming\r\nargument against that, when we came to consider that they were desired\r\nto be with every completing number; that those completing numbers are\r\nsold to the people in railroad trains and elsewhere and are coming into\r\nthe second-hand periodical market, where we must look for many to make\r\nup our sets. Now as to the point which Mr. Jones has spoken of. If the\r\nmagazine is to be perforated to be put in the binder, as the completing\r\nnumber is to have the title and index, as we proposed, in a separate\r\nsection, it can be removed by undoing the stitching, or sewing, if it is\r\nsewed. That can be done before it is put into the binder. Of course\r\nthere is no necessity for ruining, the stitching in its entirety. There\r\nmay be some little objection there, but it is so slight that it seemed\r\nto the committee entirely counterbalanced.\r\n\r\nMr. JONES: Mr. Fletcher's reply is perfectly satisfactory on that point.\r\n\r\nW. S. BISCOE: One other suggestion: Do I understand from Mr. Fletcher,\r\nif there is a table of contents, that the index be put after the\r\ntitle-page?\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: No, the suggestion is that if there is an alphabetical\r\nindex and a table of contents, the index should be planned and arranged\r\nat the end of the volume, but that if only an index is furnished, and no\r\ntable of contents, that would be in accordance with the usual practice\r\nin such cases--the index should go, like a table of contents, after the\r\ntitle-page.\r\n\r\nMr. BISCOE: If there is no table of contents the alphabetical index is\r\nto go after the title-page? It seems to me desirable that it should\r\nalways go at the end of the volume.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I am very glad that point has been called attention to. I\r\nshould like it if Mr. Biscoe would suggest an amendment. According to\r\nthe report, when such an index is furnished, and no table of contents,\r\nthe index should be printed to follow the title-page. We might say: if\r\nan alphabetical index is furnished, it should be paged to go at the end\r\nof the volume.\r\n\r\nT. L. MONTGOMERY: Was not the committee's report to provide for the\r\nprinting of the alphabetical index in the place of a table of contents,\r\nthereby making it one section?\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: The advantage of that would be that there would be\r\nsomething to go with the title-page to make up the section. The\r\ntitle-page should be part of a section for binding as a separate\r\nsection. I wonder if most of the librarians present haven't had the same\r\nexasperating experience which I have so often had with those title-pages\r\nwhich are separate leaves, and have to be pasted into the volume. There\r\nis hardly any practice so vicious in bookmaking as having the title-page\r\npasted in. It almost always pulls out before the book is in any other\r\nrespect at all dilapidated.\r\n\r\nA. G. JOSEPHSON: I would suggest that the committee recommend that both\r\na table of contents and an index should be furnished.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: The committee would entirely agree to that, and it could\r\nvery easily be done. If an alphabetical index, in addition to the table\r\nof contents, is furnished, a practice to be preferred might be to\r\nconsolidate them.\r\n\r\nPres. CARR: I think, Mr. Fletcher, you should be able to modify your\r\nreport, before printing, to incorporate those suggestions.\r\n\r\nF. W. FAXON: If the committee is trying to get at an ideal arrangement,\r\nit might be well to suggest that the publishers of magazines have some\r\none who knows something about the contents make the index. We have a\r\nmagazine in Boston that persists in indexing articles under \"a\" and\r\n\"the,\" and proper names under \"John\" and \"James.\" But if the committee\r\nis trying to get a rule that the publishers will be most likely to\r\nadopt, it seems to me they might suggest that the index be published in\r\neach concluding number of a volume, even though the index is put in\r\nplace of that many pages of text. Of course it would not do to suggest\r\nthat these pages be taken out of advertising, but as the text usually\r\ncosts the magazine something, publishers would probably be willing to\r\ndevote four of the pages they would have to pay for to an index, which\r\nwould cost them much less.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I think it would interest the Association to know of an\r\nexample that Mrs. Fairchild sent me some time ago of the way these\r\nindexes are made. Some periodical in New York had an article on motive\r\npower for the canals, and in the index it appeared under \"Mule, Must the\r\nCanal Go?\"\r\n\r\nThe report was approved and referred to the Council.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Dr. J. S. BILLINGS the secretary read the\r\n\r\n\r\n     REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON \"INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC\r\n                              LITERATURE.\"\r\n\r\nYour committee begs to report that the final conference of delegates of\r\nthe various governments for the purpose of considering an International\r\nCatalogue of Scientific Literature was held in London on June 12 and 13,\r\n1900, and, as intimated in the report of your committee last year, owing\r\nto the failure of Congress to make it possible for delegates with power\r\nto attend, no representatives of the United States were present. Mr.\r\nHerbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, who was visiting England at the\r\ntime was informally in conference with various members of the Royal\r\nSociety and rendered effective service in enabling them to reach a\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe conference decided to undertake the issuing of the Catalogue\r\nprovided 300 complete subscriptions were received by October 1st, the\r\nquota of the United States in this being 45. During the summer the\r\nSmithsonian Institution issued a circular to American libraries and\r\nuniversities and learned societies and scientific men, announcing the\r\nfact, with the very gratifying result of the subscription to the\r\nequivalent of over 70 complete sets for a period of five years.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the International Council to finally arrange for the\r\nbeginning of the work was held in London on December 12 and 13, 1900, at\r\nwhich the necessary financial arrangements were agreed to, the Royal\r\nSociety advancing certain sums and agreeing to act as publisher, and\r\nbeing authorized to enter into contracts, etc. Doctor H. Foster Morley\r\nwas elected director and offices were secured at 34 and 35 Southampton\r\nstreet, Strand, London, W. C. The initial work has begun. The\r\npreparation of a list of periodicals to be indexed and a more careful\r\nrevision of the schedules was the first work to be done. Thus far the\r\nperiodical lists for Germany, Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,\r\nHolland, Japan, Portugal, Canada, India and Ceylon have been printed.\r\nThat for the United States is expected to be ready for transmission to\r\nLondon about August 1st.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any provision, the Smithsonian Institution is carrying\r\non the work for the United States, although with very inadequate force.\r\nIt would be very desirable if legislation could be had to enable the\r\nSmithsonian Institution to prosecute this work more vigorously and\r\nwithout drawing upon its own funds.\r\n\r\n                                           J. S. BILLINGS, _Chairman_.\r\n                                           CYRUS ADLER, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nPres. CARR: Dr. Hosmer has, I think, a communication to make that is of\r\nconcern to us all.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MEMORIAL TO JOHN FISKE.\r\n\r\nDr. HOSMER: Mr. President, and Ladies and Gentlemen:\r\n\r\nWe meet here in the midst of beautiful surroundings, but with\r\nconsiderable discomfort. Perhaps we hardly make it real to ourselves\r\nthat this is in our country a time of calamity. Never in the course of a\r\nsomewhat long experience, can I remember so many fatalities from the\r\nterrible heat of the summer. The newspapers have come to us from day to\r\nday with the list of victims from the great cities, and this morning\r\ncomes in intelligence of a death which touches us librarians very\r\nclosely--the death of John Fiske. He died yesterday at Gloucester,\r\nMass., overcome by the heat; and I think it entirely right to say that\r\nin the death of John Fiske comes the extinction of the greatest force in\r\nAmerican literature at the present moment. John Fiske, while not a\r\nmember of our association, was at one time a librarian; he had a great\r\ninterest in the Association; he was the personal friend of many of its\r\nmembers. It is perhaps quite right to say that no author at the present\r\ntime is so frequently in the mouths and in the hands of the librarians.\r\nIt has been thought fitting by the executive committee that we should\r\nmake an exception in his case, and that there should be some formal\r\nmention of his passing. I regret very much that the time is so brief.\r\nWhat I have to say must be unconsidered.\r\n\r\nIn several directions, John Fiske was a great writer. First as regards\r\nthe doctrine of evolution, the great idea which has come to the world in\r\nour day. What a great and solemn thing it is! The slow process through\r\nthe lapse of ages from the monad to that which crawls, then to that\r\nwhich swims, then to that which flies, until we come at last to that\r\nwhich walks erect with brow expanded broadly to the light of heaven; the\r\nslow increment of intelligence in the brain, as species becomes merged\r\nin constantly higher species; the extension of infancy, with its\r\nbeautiful sequence of humanity, of love, of spirituality. This has come\r\nto be accepted by scientific minds as the path which the divine energy\r\nchooses to follow in the work of creation. Now, among our American\r\nwriters, I suppose there is no one who has had so much to do with the\r\ndevelopment of the doctrine of evolution as John Fiske. He was the\r\nintimate friend and counsellor of Darwin, of Huxley, of Herbert Spencer,\r\nof Tyndall. They recognized in him their peer, and if it is the\r\ncase--and I believe it to be the case--that John Fiske contributed to\r\nthe doctrine of evolution the idea of the \"extension of infancy\" as\r\nbeing the cause of what is most gentle and lovely in humanity he\r\ndeserves to be named with the first of those who have been connected\r\nwith that great theory.\r\n\r\nIn the second place as a historian, this wonderfully versatile man\r\nstands among the very first of the country. As a historian, John Fiske\r\nis not to be spoken of without discrimination. He had his limitations. I\r\ndo not think that he had the power of picturesque description to the\r\nextent that Motley or Prescott possessed it. I do not think that he had\r\nthe power of indefatigable research to the extent that it was possessed\r\nby our honored fellow-member, Justin Winsor. I do not think that he had\r\nthe faculty of character-drawing as it was possessed for instance by the\r\ngreat historian, Clarendon, of the seventeenth century. But John Fiske\r\nhad his gift, and it was a remarkable one. Taking a chaotic mass of\r\nfacts, I know of no other American writer who had such genius to go in\r\namong them, to discern the vital links that connected one with another,\r\nto get order and system out of it, and then to present the result with a\r\nlucidity and a beauty which carried captive every reader. That was his\r\nfaculty, as a historian; and he possessed it to such an extent and he\r\nused it in such a way that he is entitled to a place among our greatest\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nNor are these the only claims to distinction of this great man who has\r\ngone. As a religious leader, John Fiske is one of the foremost men of\r\nthe time. His \"Destiny of man,\" his \"Idea of God,\" his latest noble\r\naddress on the immortality of the soul, not yet published, are priceless\r\nwritings, and men and women among the very best and brightest find in\r\nthese books the best expression and guidance for their religious\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nEvery one here has had opportunity, abundant opportunity, to know the\r\ngreatness of John Fiske's mind. Few here, perhaps no other one, has had\r\nsuch opportunity as I have had to know the warmth and the generosity of\r\nhis heart. For ten years in the Washington University, at St. Louis, we\r\nwere colleagues; for 35 years we have been friends, and as I stand here\r\nbefore you to speak of him, my emotions fairly overcome me and I can do\r\nnothing but take my seat; but it is appropriate that in the American\r\nLibrary Association there should be some recognition taken of the\r\npassing from the midst of us of this great and noble figure.\r\n\r\nPres. CARR: After these fitting and touching words, we can hardly have\r\nit in our hearts to transact any further business this session, and\r\ntherefore, if there is no objection, we will proceed to take an\r\nadjournment.\r\n\r\nMr. CRUNDEN: I think a fitting action, on the suggestion of Dr. Hosmer,\r\nwould be the appointment of a committee, with Dr. Hosmer as chairman, to\r\ndraw up memorial resolutions. I make a motion to that effect.\r\n\r\nThe motion was adopted, and a committee was appointed, of J. K. Hosmer,\r\nGeorge Iles, and R. G. Thwaites.\r\n\r\nAdjourned 12 m.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _THIRD SESSION._\r\n\r\n           (FOUNTAIN SPRING HOUSE, SATURDAY MORNING, JULY 6.)\r\n\r\nThe meeting was called to order by President CARR at 10.20.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of R. R. BOWKER, chairman, W. E. HENRY read the\r\n\r\n\r\n                REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC DOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Public Documents this year makes an exclusively\r\nnegative report. The Congress was occupied so exclusively with matters\r\nof larger public policy, particularly in relation with new territorial\r\ndevelopments, that no attention was given in either house to public\r\ndocuments measures. A bill was presented in the House of Representatives\r\nby Mr. Heatwole, on somewhat different lines from the Platt bill offered\r\nin the Senate last year, but like that in essential conformity with the\r\ngeneral position taken by the American Library Association. This bill\r\ndid not, however, progress beyond the introductory steps.\r\n\r\nWithin the past twelvemonth the Indiana State Library has issued its\r\nuseful \"Subject catalog of U. S. public documents in the Indiana State\r\nLibrary,\" as an appendix to the 23d biennial report of the state\r\nlibrary, covering 289 pages, and presenting a useful conspectus within\r\nits field. This index, while serving helpfully as a general key for the\r\nuse of other libraries through the range of documents contained in each\r\nspecific library, suggests the greater importance of an adequate subject\r\nindex to U. S. government publications in general, which could be made a\r\nchecklist by several state and other libraries. The Indiana State\r\nLibrary has also prepared an index to the _Documentary Journal_ of\r\nIndiana from the beginning of that publication in 1835 to 1899, which is\r\nincluded in the 23d report of that library.\r\n\r\nThere is also little to report as to state publications, although there\r\nis evident a growth of interest in state bibliography, particularly in\r\nthe state libraries. Part second of the bibliography of \"State\r\npublications\" is promised for the present year, including the states of\r\nNew York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,\r\nand Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nA contribution of interest within this field has been made by the Acorn\r\nClub, of Connecticut, which has issued an elaborate bibliographical\r\nrecord of \"Connecticut state laws,\" from the earliest times to 1836,\r\ncompiled by A.C. Bates, librarian of the Connecticut Historical Society,\r\na useful feature of the work being the indication, when possible, of\r\nsome library in which each issue recorded may be found. Record may also\r\nbe made, in this connection, of the work accomplished or accomplishing\r\nby the Public Archives Commission of the American Historical\r\nAssociation, headed by Prof. William McDonald, of Bowdoin College, as\r\nchairman, in which Professors Robinson, of Columbia, Caldwell, of\r\nNebraska, Bugbee, of Texas, who are his associates on the committee,\r\nhave the co-operation of representatives in the several states. While\r\nthis commission does not concern itself specifically with bibliography,\r\nit is preparing the way for a better bibliography of state publications\r\nthan has hitherto been possible, by investigating the conditions of the\r\npublic archives of each state, with a view to inducing the systematic\r\nand more complete collection in each state of its own archives,\r\nincluding its printed documents as well as manuscript records.\r\n\r\n                                        R. R. BOWKER,     }\r\n                                        W. E. HENRY,      }_Committee._\r\n                                        JOHNSON BRIGHAM.  }\r\n\r\nHERBERT PUTNAM: I would suggest that the Superintendent of Documents is\r\nhere, and that possibly he might have some suggestion or recommendation\r\nto make on the subject of this report.\r\n\r\nL. C. FERRELL: I suppose anything I may have to say will be in addition\r\nto what was said in the report of the committee on public documents, as\r\nthe report was rather negative. The matter of bringing about any\r\nlegislation requires time and involves a great deal of hard work upon\r\nsomebody. This is especially so if the subject is one in which no member\r\nof Congress, in particular, has a personal interest. It generally takes\r\n10 or 12 years to pass any bill of interest to the people that no member\r\nof Congress will take care of personally. If it is a matter like saving\r\nthe country, you can get a fifty million dollar bill passed in half an\r\nhour, but you cannot get a member of Congress to take up and pass a bill\r\nchanging the method of printing and the distribution of documents\r\nwithout a great deal of pressure. Now, if Mr. Heatwole, chairman of the\r\nHouse Committee on Printing, was here, I think we might accomplish\r\nsomething to advantage on that subject, because I think if he could meet\r\nthis great body of librarians face to face, we might get him to commit\r\nhimself as to what he will do next session. He has promised me to take\r\nup this matter next winter and revise the printing laws from \"A\" to \"Z,\"\r\nas he expressed it, but whether he will do so or not, I cannot say. Now,\r\nI shall prepare another bill, or have the old bill introduced again, I\r\ndo not know which, and, as long as I remain in the office of\r\nSuperintendent of Documents, I shall endeavor to bring about legislation\r\non the lines proposed in the bills heretofore presented to Congress. In\r\nthe first place, I want all the government periodicals taken out of the\r\nCongressional series and bound in cloth, so that they can be distributed\r\nto the libraries as soon as they are printed. But one edition of any\r\ndocument ought to be printed, and that edition ought to have the same\r\nendorsement on the back and the same title on the inside. If we continue\r\nto print duplicate and triplicate editions--departmental, bureau, and\r\ncongressional--librarians will always have trouble in classifying and\r\ncataloging them. As far as my record is concerned, I suppose most of you\r\nare familiar with it. I am constantly endeavoring to improve the\r\nservice. I have adopted a cumulative index for the monthly catalog;\r\ncumulative for six months, with a consolidated index for the entire\r\nyear, in the December number. That was done mainly because the annual\r\ncatalog cannot be printed so as to be distributed promptly, and the\r\nmonthly catalog fully indexed can be made to answer all temporary\r\npurposes. Now, we have three series of catalogs, as you all know,\r\nperhaps, each one serving a distinctive purpose. The document catalog,\r\nor comprehensive index--its official title--is intended for permanent\r\nuse. It includes all documents printed during a fiscal year--July 1 to\r\nJune 30, following. The document index is a subject, title, and author\r\nindex of all congressional documents, indicating the number of each\r\ndocument and the volume in which it is bound up. In the monthly catalog\r\nall documents are arranged alphabetically under the author of the\r\ndocument, and everything related to the same subject is brought together\r\nin the index. Now, we are broadening out a little in our work; probably\r\ndoing something Congress never contemplated we should do when the office\r\nwas established. We are doing a good deal of bibliographical work, and I\r\nintend to enlarge upon it as I have the opportunity. We have published\r\n\"Reports of explorations printed in the documents of the United States\r\ngovernment, a contribution toward a bibliography,\" by Miss Hasse; a\r\n\"Bibliography of U. S. public documents relating to inter-oceanic\r\ncommunication across Nicaragua, Panama, etc.,\" and we expect soon to\r\ntake up the subject of documents relating to the various states, the\r\npurpose being to make a complete bibliography of everything printed in\r\nthe U. S. public documents concerning each state and territory. We\r\npropose to take up the matter of documents relating to the Louisiana\r\npurchase first, because we are going to have a great exposition two\r\nyears from now at St. Louis to commemorate that great event.\r\n\r\nJ. C. DANA presented the\r\n\r\n\r\n REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CO-OPERATION WITH THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL\r\n                              ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\nEarly last winter I secured from librarians, library assistants and\r\nteachers about 25 brief articles on co-operation between libraries and\r\nschools. These articles were written with special reference to teachers.\r\nI made a descriptive list of them and sent this list to leading\r\neducational journals in this country, with the request that the editors\r\nthereof select from it one or more of the articles and publish them\r\nprior to July 1, 1901. Largely through the kindness of Mr. Winship,\r\neditor of the _Journal of Education_ of Boston, I got the promise of\r\npublication of these articles from educational editors to the number of\r\n25. The articles were duly sent out. I regret to have to report that I\r\nhave received notice of the publication of less than half a dozen of the\r\nwhole number. A few others may have been published, but the editors have\r\nnever notified me of the fact. The articles were brief and chiefly\r\nwritten by persons prominent in library work in this country, they were\r\nof general interest, and seemed to deserve publication. The fact that\r\nthey did not get it is to my mind somewhat indicative of the comparative\r\nunimportance of libraries in the opinion of educational people of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSince coming here I have learned of another little incident which throws\r\nsome light on our relation to the educational profession of this\r\ncountry. From the office of _Public Libraries_ the program of the\r\nmeeting of the library department of the N. E. A. at Detroit was sent to\r\n32 leading educational journals in this country with the request that\r\nthey print it. Of these 32 papers two only printed the program as\r\nrequested, or at least two only printed it and gave due notice of the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nFrom all this we may learn, as I have stated more than once before, that\r\nlibraries and librarians are as yet held in small esteem by the\r\neducational people of this country. Our influence among them is not\r\ngreat. It is not considered that we are connected in any important way\r\nwith educational work. This is the opinion held by the rank and file. I\r\nbelieve this to be true in spite of the fact that the leaders of the N.\r\nE. A. have themselves been more than generous to the library department.\r\nThose leaders, largely through the influence of Mr. Hutchins of\r\nWisconsin, gave a special appropriation of over $500 to a committee of\r\nthis department for the publication of a report on the relation of\r\nlibraries and schools. This report has been quite widely circulated and\r\nhas been well received by both teachers and librarians. We owe that to\r\nthe N. E. A. We owe it to the appreciation of library work by the\r\nleaders of the N. E. A. Nevertheless, taking the teaching profession at\r\nlarge, I think it safe to assume that our experience with the\r\neducational journals during the past winter is indicative of the\r\nteacher's attitude toward libraries and their possible helpfulness in\r\nthe school room. This fact should not discourage us. On the contrary it\r\nshould stimulate us to make our collections and our work with them of\r\nstill more consequence until it becomes quite impossible for anyone in\r\nthe educational world to be ignorant of, or to fail to take advantage\r\nof, the assistance to every day teaching work which we believe our\r\nlibraries can give.\r\n\r\nIt is quite difficult, of course, if not impossible, for us to produce\r\nany great effect on the teachers of the present day save through\r\nindividual work in our respective communities. No one can ask for a\r\nbetter opportunity to see the result of such work than I have had\r\nmyself. I have seen two or three hundred teachers in the course of four\r\nor five years changed from an attitude of indifference toward the\r\nlibrary as an aid in every day school room work, to one of readiness not\r\nto say eagerness, to take advantage of every opportunity the library\r\ncould possibly offer. Many other librarians have had similar\r\nexperiences. But this work does not go on rapidly enough to influence\r\nthe profession as a whole. The teaching profession as it now stands is,\r\nas I have said, indifferent toward us. One thing we can do, and that is,\r\narouse an interest among those who are to become teachers. After\r\nindividual work in our own towns the best thing we can do, and\r\nespecially the best thing we can do as an association, is to stimulate\r\nan interest in library training in the normal schools of this country.\r\nInterest in this phase of practical work has increased very much in\r\nnormal schools the last few years. This is especially true in the west;\r\nand perhaps more true in Wisconsin than in any other state.\r\n\r\nMr. Dewey has recently given this matter consideration and I shall be\r\nmuch pleased if he will say something further by way of supplementing\r\nthis informal report of mine, on what has been done and what can be done\r\nin normal schools toward interesting teachers in the use of libraries in\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nMELVIL DEWEY: What Mr. Dana has said, though perhaps a little\r\ndiscouraging in its tone, is pretty nearly the truth; but we ought to\r\nremember this--the public school teachers and the other teachers of this\r\ncountry are a badly overworked class. Many a man and woman has broken\r\ndown of nervous prostration in school, who has entered a library and\r\nworked hard and kept well. Our friends on the school side of educational\r\nwork have a strain that comes from the disciplinary side. Worry kills\r\nmore than work, and teachers have to meet this question of discipline;\r\nthey have to take responsibility in the place of parents; they have an\r\ninterminable number of reports to fill out; they have a mass of\r\nexamination papers to read and deal with; and they have examinations to\r\nmake until they are driven almost wild. Now, we go to them and present\r\nour case, our arguments for co-operation with the library. They admit\r\nit; they are convinced of it; but they have not vital energy and force\r\nenough to take up the matter and do much work in our cause. It is not\r\nthat they doubt. They won't question the high plane on which we want to\r\nput the library, and they want to fulfil all their duties. I believe if\r\nwe were to change places and were put into their routine, the majority\r\nof us would do just what they do--put it off until a more convenient\r\nseason. I think that is the real trouble with our teachers. They are\r\noverworked, many of them; they are in certain ruts; and my suggestion is\r\nto try to reach them when they begin their work, through the normal\r\nschools. If we can get the normal school authorities to give the right\r\nkind of instruction and the right kind of a start to the teachers, we\r\nwill accomplish a great deal more. We can do twice as much in working\r\nwith the student teacher; it is like working in plaster of paris--easy\r\nwhile in a soft and plastic stage, but you leave it awhile and it\r\nhardens. So I should say, in considering this report, that we ought not\r\nto be discouraged. It is what we should expect, and we should turn our\r\nattention to, doing all we can to reach the young teachers who are now\r\nin a plastic state, ready to be moulded, but who in ten years will be\r\ndominant forces in education.\r\n\r\nMiss M. E. AHERN: I wish to call attention to the fact that the program\r\nof the Library Department of the National Educational Association calls\r\nfor a greeting from some representative of the A. L. A., and I therefore\r\nrequest, as secretary of that section and as an earnest member of the A.\r\nL. A., that you appoint some member to carry such greetings to the\r\nLibrary Department of the N. E. A.\r\n\r\nIt was voted that Mr. Crunden be appointed to represent the Library\r\nAssociation at the N. E. A. meeting.\r\n\r\nF. M. CRUNDEN: Touching the subject before this meeting, I want to\r\ncorroborate the statement made by Mr. Dana regarding the progress that\r\ncomes quickly if you once induce the teachers of a city to accept, even\r\nin a small measure, the co-operation of the library. Only a few years\r\nago we almost had to beg the teachers to use our books. We had to offer\r\nevery inducement to them, and they did it, most of them, rather\r\nreluctantly. Now the great majority of our schools use the library\r\nbooks. Not long ago I asked three questions of the teachers using the\r\nlibrary in their work: What value do you place upon the library in\r\nsupplementary reading? What effect has it had thus far on the progress\r\nof your pupils in their studies? Is it an aid to the pupils? All these\r\nquestion were answered most satisfactorily to us. Several say the\r\nlibrary books are worth as much as any study in the curriculum, while\r\ntwo of them say that the library books are worth all the rest. And\r\nregarding discipline, the universal testimony is that the library is an\r\naid to the discipline. In the school where most reading is done, the\r\nprincipal tells me that the problem of discipline has been practically\r\neliminated; they give no more thought to it, because the children are\r\ninterested and pleasantly occupied, so they do not get into mischief.\r\nThe library has aided in all studies, is the basis of language work, has\r\nimproved the language of the children, and has given an interest to the\r\nschool work that it did not have before. Now if the teachers can only\r\nunderstand that this is going to lighten their work instead of\r\nincreasing it, they will accept the co-operation of the library.\r\n\r\nDr. CANFIELD: Just one word to express my appreciation of the fairness\r\nwith which Mr. Dewey put before you the position of the teachers and to\r\nadd this statement: You are all likely to forget that you determine the\r\nlines of your own work and that a teacher's work is laid out for her by\r\nother people, and it takes about all the time and strength of the pupil\r\nto meet the immediate demands of the curriculum, which is often very\r\nunwisely laid out. I want to add to that, as a proof of the interest\r\ntaken by teachers, I know of my personal knowledge that the teachers of\r\nthe high schools of New York have frequently placed their personal\r\nendorsement upon library cards for the pupils they have sent to the\r\nlibraries and for whose books they are personally responsible. They\r\ncannot prove their interest in any better way than that.\r\n\r\nMr. DANA: I just want a moment to correct a possible impression that I\r\nwas finding fault with the educational profession of this country. I was\r\nnot finding fault with them, but finding fault with ourselves. If we are\r\nnot yet a power to the teachers of this country, then it is our own\r\nfault. We do not as yet understand our own fitness, especially in\r\nrelation to schools and reading in the schools, and we do not even know\r\nwhat we want to do, or what books to recommend. We do not know what the\r\nfield of work in the schools is. How, then, can we expect to teach it;\r\nto urge a thing in regard to which we are not yet free of all doubts?\r\nThe fault is our own possibly, and yet it is not all our own fault. It\r\nis largely a question of necessary time.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Dr. E. C. RICHARDSON, chairman, the secretary read the\r\n\r\n\r\n           REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on International Co-operation in taking up the work\r\nreferred to it by the Association has limited itself this year to a\r\nconsideration of the question of a uniform standard of book statistics.\r\nThis question is a two-fold one, first, what should be called a book,\r\nsecond, when statistics are classified, what are the most practical and\r\nuseful classes?\r\n\r\nIn respect of the first matter, it recommends that all books for\r\nstatistical purposes be divided into two or three classes. (1) Books of\r\n50 pages or over; (2) books under 50 pages; or, where books of under\r\neight pages are regarded at all, books of from eight to 49 pages; and\r\n(3) books under eight pages.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the second question, the chairman has prepared a\r\ncomparative table of the usage of the _Publishers' Weekly_, _Bookseller\r\nand Newsdealer_, _Publishers' Circular_, _Bibliografia Italiana_,\r\n_Hinrichs_ and _Reinwald_, arranging these in the order of the Dewey\r\nclassification. This was printed by Mr. Bowker for the use of the\r\ncommittee, and is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\n        _Table showing classification of book trade statistics._\r\n\r\nSome of the chief matters for attention are the questions of\r\n_Biography_, whether by itself or scattered in classes; _Literary\r\nHistory and Art_, by itself or under Philology, or under Bibliography,\r\nor scattered; _Juveniles_, by itself or divided among Fiction, Poetry,\r\nEducation, etc.; _Scientific School Books_, _Geographies_, _etc._, under\r\nsubject or under Education; _Art of War_, _Commerce_, _etc._, under\r\nEconomics or Technology. All these conflict somewhere in usage shown and\r\nin the judgment of the various members of the committee, although there\r\nis a majority for keeping Biography as a separate class--contrary to\r\nunanimous foreign usage.\r\n\r\n  ===================================================================\r\n      DEWEY (ORDER). |    PUB.

H. Putnam, to the International Congress of Booksellers,\r\nand it is hoped that there may be a committee appointed or empowered to\r\nconfer with this committee, and that some practical result may be\r\nreached in spite of various difficulties. This committee therefore\r\nrecommends for the purpose of library reports, etc., the use of the\r\nDewey order and divisions given in the accompanying table, with such\r\nmodification as may be necessary to meet book trade requirements, but in\r\nthe case of all recommendations begs to make them subject to an\r\ninternational understanding, and asks that the committee be continued\r\nand given full power to adopt a recommended order, providing an\r\nunderstanding can be reached with a representative of the booksellers.\r\nIf such an understanding is reached, efforts should be made to get the\r\nfurther concurrence of other library associations and bibliographical\r\nbodies generally.\r\n\r\n                                      ERNEST C. RICHARDSON, _Chairman,\r\n                                                     for the Committee_.\r\n\r\nJ. C. DANA for the\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COMMITTEE ON LIBRARY TRAINING\r\n\r\nmade a brief statement, that the committee as a whole had been unable\r\nthis year to visit and report upon the schools. He presented, as the\r\nreport of the committee, a letter from Dr. E. C. Richardson, one of its\r\nmembers who had visited several of the schools as lecturer.[D]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BEER spoke briefly on\r\n\r\n\r\n             COLLECTION AND CATALOGING OF EARLY NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\nThe few remarks I have to make on this subject are prompted by a recent\r\neffort to collect from printed catalogs the scattered newspaper material\r\nfor the first 15 years of the 19th century. The collection of\r\ninformation on the locality of files of newspapers up to 1800 has been\r\ncommenced, and will in time be completed by Mr. Nelson, who publishes\r\nhis results in the \"Archives of the State of New Jersey.\" Many\r\ncorrections will be necessary to his list, but it will even in its\r\npresent shape be of great advantage to historical students.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the work increases almost in geometrical proportion as\r\nthe dates approach the present era. The great increase of newspapers\r\nrenders it necessary to divide the work into decades. I have chosen to\r\ncarry it to 1815 on account of the importance to Louisiana history of\r\nthe reports on the battle of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe particular feature in cataloging which I would fain see carried out\r\nin every library is the chronological conspectus, of which so admirable\r\nan example exists in Bolton's catalog of scientific documents, which is,\r\nor ought to be, familiar to all present.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly simple and easy to prepare and is of the greatest\r\npossible service, both to the librarian and the student.\r\n\r\nTake any folio book ruled in wide columns with an ample margin. For my\r\npurpose I start by heading the first column 1800, and so on to the end\r\nof the page. Taking material from Mr. Galbreath's useful compilation, I\r\nfind that in the libraries of Ohio there is only one title which will\r\nappear under this head, the _Western Spy_ in the collection of the\r\nCincinnati Young Men's Mercantile Library. Enter in the marginal column\r\nthe full details of the publication of this newspaper and draw a\r\nhorizontal line across the column. The years 1802-3-4, etc., present an\r\nincreasing number of titles. The horizontal lines in the columns present\r\nan immediate summary of all the newspaper literature on the subject.\r\n\r\nDr. G. E. WIRE read a paper on\r\n\r\n             SOME PRINCIPLES OF BOOK AND PICTURE SELECTION.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 54.)\r\n\r\nMELVIL DEWEY: I want to say a word about that New York list of pictures.\r\nWhen we printed that bulletin a great chorus of criticism arose from\r\namong the newspapers, and we smiled; we said it was characteristic of\r\nnewspapers to discuss a thing without knowing at all what they were\r\ntalking about. But I did not suppose that same characteristic would\r\nappear in this Association. Our bulletin states very distinctly what it\r\nis for, and it makes its own case absolutely infallible. We had to meet\r\nthe problem in the state of New York, of circulating pictures bought\r\nwith the taxpayers' money, to be put on the walls of the school\r\nhouses--Jewish schools, Roman Catholic schools and schools of many\r\ndenominations. Under those peculiar conditions it was a question whether\r\nwe could carry the movement at all, and we selected about 50 people,\r\nwhose judgment was most reliable, and asked them, out of several hundred\r\npictures, to select 100 that would be open to no objection of any kind.\r\nThere was no effort whatever to select the hundred _best_ pictures. They\r\nsimply made a list that would pass the legislature. It included pictures\r\nthat people ridiculed sadly; and yet we had on file letters from\r\nprominent people in the state to the effect that they would protest\r\nagainst certain well-known pictures, and we thought it wiser not to\r\nraise issues over minor details. Our bulletin is simply a list of\r\npictures that have been passed by representatives of various religious\r\nand ethical interests. You may think it most absurd that certain\r\npictures, perhaps the most famous, should have been voted out of such a\r\nlist, but if you were to go through the schools of the state of New York\r\nor any other state you would find that there are conscientious mothers\r\nand fathers, who have had no opportunity for art training, who would get\r\ndown on their knees and pray that some of these pictures might not be\r\nput on the walls of the school room. If you do not know that, you are\r\nnot familiar with the sentiment in the rural districts. There was a\r\nspecific purpose in our action; we heard all of these criticisms, and we\r\ndid the thing that seemed right and best under the circumstances. There\r\nare about a hundred of us on the state library staff, but we do not yet,\r\nas a body, venture to feel as omniscient as some single individuals\r\nregard themselves. I strongly believe that it is not a bad thing to take\r\nthe opinion of experts. We are perfectly willing to show respect to the\r\nspecialist in his own field, and I think it is mighty unwise advice to\r\ngive young librarians, when they are told not to ask the opinion of a\r\ngood specialist, whose verdict commands the confidence of the public.\r\n\r\nAdjourned at 12.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _FOURTH SESSION._\r\n\r\n        (LIBRARY HALL, MADISON, WIS., MONDAY AFTERNOON, JULY 8.)\r\n\r\nPresident CARR called the meeting to order at 2.25 p.m., and in a few\r\nwords expressed the appreciation of the Association for the delightful\r\narrangements that had made \"Madison day\" so interesting and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nMiss MARY W. PLUMMER then spoke on\r\n\r\n\r\n                SOME EXPERIENCES IN FOREIGN LIBRARIES[E]\r\n\r\nMiss PLUMMER deprecated any desire to make a comparison between foreign\r\nand American libraries. They served so different a purpose, for the most\r\npart, that comparison was impossible. Libraries, like systems of\r\neducation, were an outcome of the history, of the race-temperament and\r\ncharacteristics, and of the social conditions of a people. And it was\r\naccording to one's point of view whether such a comparison would be\r\nfavorable to one side or the other. One thing seemed almost\r\npredicable--that, wherever democracy was making its way, there the\r\nlibrary supported by the people and for the use of the people had a\r\ntendency to appear patterned more or less after those of England and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nEnglish libraries were not touched upon, but the leading collections of\r\nGermany, France and Italy were briefly described. At the Bayreuth and\r\nNuremberg libraries books were secured without formality, and all\r\nprivileges were extended to the visiting colleague, with entire\r\ntrustingness and fraternity. In Italy more formality was required, the\r\nlibraries being government institutions for reference use, but courtesy\r\nand a desire to be of service prevailed throughout. Considering the\r\nquestion, \"What do people do who want to read fiction in Italy--the same\r\npeople who are always wanting the new novels in this country?\" Miss\r\nPlummer said: \"Apparently, these people do not exist in sufficiently\r\nlarge numbers to be considered in the libraries. If a work of note comes\r\nout, such as a new novel by d'Annunzio or Fogazzaro, it can be had at\r\nthe book shops in paper for two lire or two and a half, _i.e._, 40 to 50\r\ncents, and people buy it and lend it. In some of the little book shops\r\nbooks circulate for a small fee, but not by any means the best class of\r\nbooks. The government libraries may purchase the novels of such authors\r\nas those I have mentioned, but they do not make haste about it, and in\r\none library (a municipal, circulating library) no book can go out that\r\nhas not been in the library's possession three months. The novel-reading\r\nclass is chiefly composed of visiting or resident English and Americans,\r\nand in all Italian cities of any size there is a subscription library\r\nwhere books in English can be had.\"\r\n\r\nAt Florence, when one discovers the large and enterprising subscription\r\nlibrary which the Viesseux, father and son, have carried on for several\r\ngenerations, one's troubles in getting books seem ended, for they have\r\nall the books that the government libraries cannot and do not buy--a\r\nlarge subscription list of periodicals, open shelves, late books\r\nseparated from the rest, and they will get what one asks for if they\r\nhaven't it already. If American publishers sent their lists regularly to\r\nViesseux one would probably find more American books there. Further than\r\nthis, one's subscription entitles one to a book or books by mail to any\r\nplace in Italy or in the surrounding countries where one may be staying.\r\nOf the Florentine libraries, the Marucellian is the nearest our ideal of\r\na modern reference library in its collections as in its methods. It has,\r\nas its chief field of purchase, the best modern books in belles-lettres,\r\nand as it is open in the evening its rooms are often crowded with\r\nstudents and readers until closing time. It has a card catalog by\r\nsubjects and a duplicate card catalog of part of the collection of the\r\nNational Library of Florence; a ms. catalog in book form by author,\r\nwhich is accessible to readers; a room set apart for women students,\r\nwith a woman, a university graduate, to preside over it. The National\r\nLibrary is a much greater collection and older, in its 87 rooms; and its\r\nperiodical room is the most modern of all, with its magazines from all\r\ncountries, even our own _Harper_ and _Century_ showing their familiar\r\nfaces on the racks. A special room here is devoted to the catalogs,\r\nwhich were partly in ms. book form and partly on cards, and students\r\nwere always searching the pages or the cards without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nAt Rome the Victor Emanuel Library had a small room shelved with the\r\nLeyden catalogs, in constant consultation. As in most of the government\r\nlibraries, there was a table reserved for women, though it did not seem\r\nto be much used.\r\n\r\nAmong the Paris libraries described were the Ste. Geneviève, the\r\nSorbonne, and one of the ward or \"arondissement\" libraries. The latter\r\nwas in the Mairie, and open at 8 p.m. only. The books were in floor\r\ncases, with a counter between them and the people, and on the counter\r\nlay small pamphlet finding lists. It is not hard to keep these up to\r\ndate, since the libraries themselves are far from being so, and new\r\nbooks are not often added. The librarian, who had some other occupation\r\nduring the day and served here in the evening, to add a trifle to his\r\nincome, got books and charged them in a book as people asked for them.\r\nUse of the library was permitted only after obtaining as guarantor a\r\ncitizen living in the same arondissement with the would-be borrower.\r\nWhile this kind of library is of course much better than none, and the\r\nsituation in Paris is that much better than in Italian cities, the fact\r\nthat the hours of opening are only in the evening is a barrier to much\r\nusefulness. On the other hand, a library to each arondissement is a fair\r\nallowance, and no one has to go very far to reach his library. For the\r\nmost part they are patronized by the small tradesmen of the neighborhood\r\nand their families. A large proportion of our reading public is missing\r\nfrom these municipal libraries--they buy their own books, in paper, at\r\nthe department stores, and make no use whatever of the government\r\nlibraries or of these small circulating centers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Miss Plummer said: \"If I were asked what sort of library\r\nwas most needed in France and Italy, I should say first _good_ libraries\r\nfor children and young people. The children of these countries read\r\nearlier than ours, the language presenting fewer difficulties of\r\nspelling and pronunciation, and many of them are fond of reading. Good\r\nmaterial is not plentiful, and what there is the child has no help in\r\ngetting hold of. Bad reading there is in abundance, in the shape of\r\nso-called comic papers, etc., at every turn and for an infinitesimal\r\nprice. One is ready to say that it is better not to know how to read\r\nthan to be induced by one's knowledge to make such acquaintance as\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nDr. J. K. HOSMER followed with an amusing fable, entitled\r\n\r\n\r\n    FROM THE READER'S POINT OF VIEW, AND THE ERA OF THE PLACARD.[F]\r\n\r\nThe subject was presented in the form of a clever parable, satirizing\r\nthe present-day \"booming\" of popular books, and the unseemliness and\r\nvulgarities of modern advertising methods. It concluded with an\r\n\"imaginary conversation\" between a librarian and a reader, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'A fellow-librarian?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Not quite that,' said he, 'but one who uses libraries--a reader, in\r\nfact.'\r\n\r\n\"I felt a sudden thrill of satisfaction. Here at last I had found my\r\nreader, and I faithfully proceeded at once to get at his point of view.\r\n'Well,' said I, 'is it not an inspiration to live in the era of the\r\nplacard; and what do you mean to do for the Great American Bill Board\r\nTrust?'\r\n\r\n\"We walked down the street arm in arm, and this is the rather\r\nunsympathetic monologue in which the reader indulged:\r\n\r\n\"'The bill-board--and I mean by the bill-board coarse and obtrusive\r\nadvertising in general, whether shown in this defacement of natural\r\nobjects, road-signs, street car panels, or in newspaper columns--an evil\r\nfrom which even the public library is not free--the bill-board is an\r\nevil, but after all only a minor evil. If we had nothing worse than that\r\namong our social problems to vex us, we should indeed be fortunate.\r\nAdvertising is a legitimate incident of commerce. The merchant who has\r\nwares to sell may properly make his commodities known. I own I study the\r\nadvertising pages of my _Century_ and _Scribner_ with scarcely less\r\ninterest than I do the text. But the world is so full of bad taste!\r\nThere is no sanctity or silence through which the coarse scream of the\r\nhuckster may not at any time penetrate. The loud bill-board is but the\r\nscream of the huckster transmuted so that it may attack still another\r\nsense. The wonder is that this bill-board, and its fellow enormities in\r\nthe street car panel and the newspaper columns, do not repel instead of\r\nattract. In the case of refined minds certainly repulsion must be felt.\r\nNow for myself,' said the reader, and here I thought he spoke\r\nconceitedly, 'the fact that a thing is coarsely and loudly advertised is\r\na strong, almost invincible reason for my not buying it, however\r\nnecessary it may seem. With the world in general, however, the standard\r\nof taste is low. Coarseness does not offend; also, it pays to use it.\r\n\r\n\"'I have sometimes seen on library walls placards sent in with the\r\ndemand, 'Please display this prominently,' that have exercised upon me\r\nan immediate deterrent effect. Still,' said the reader, with his\r\nsuperior air, 'do not think me ill-natured. The best thing we can do is\r\nto keep our temper, stamp down as we can what becomes too outrageous and\r\nindecent, and labor and pray for the refinement of the world's taste.\r\nThis no doubt will come very slowly.'\r\n\r\n\"'Can we help the thing forward at all?' said I, falling in for the\r\nmoment with his humor.\r\n\r\n\"'Only as we can promote in general the diffusion of sweetness and\r\nlight,' said the reader. 'If a man should be aroused to attack directly\r\nI believe he might strike a more effective blow through ridicule than\r\nthrough denunciation. Keep denunciation for the more weighty and ghastly\r\nevils that beset us; a mere annoyance it is better to laugh away if we\r\ncan do it.'\"\r\n\r\nAdjourned at 3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _FIFTH SESSION._\r\n\r\n           (FOUNTAIN SPRING HOUSE, TUESDAY MORNING, JULY 9.)\r\n\r\nThe meeting was called to order by President CARR at 10.20 a.m.\r\n\r\nThe president announced the receipt in pamphlet form of the\r\n\r\n                     REPORT ON GIFTS AND BEQUESTS.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 87.)\r\n\r\nThis was read by title, and filed for publication in the Proceedings.\r\n\r\nW. I. FLETCHER presented the\r\n\r\n                REPORT OF THE A. L. A. PUBLISHING BOARD.\r\n\r\n                            (_See_ p. 103.)\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: I wish to remind some of you who were with us 25 years ago in\r\nPhiladelphia, when we organized the A. L. A., and who, during that whole\r\nperiod, have studied its interests so closely, that the time has come at\r\nlast when we are really on the way to secure one of the things we have\r\nalways thought most important--co-operative printed catalog cards. This\r\nwill make for all of us less drudgery and more inspiration, for there is\r\nnot much inspiration in writing out author's names; it will relieve us\r\nof a considerable burden; it will produce economy and increase\r\nefficiency; and it appeals strongly to our trustees and business men. It\r\nis perhaps the most important thing we have to do, and there have been\r\napparently insuperable obstacles to success; but we have always hoped\r\nfor one complete solution. And this was that it could be done at the\r\nNational Library in Washington, with its printing presses, post-office\r\nfacilities, copyright department and great central collection. You\r\nremember that when the Pacific railroad was built, and as the ends came\r\ntogether to make the connection, a great celebration was held through\r\nthe country, a thrill that the work was at last done; and I feel to-day,\r\nnow that we hear in this able report that printed catalog cards are\r\nreally to be undertaken at the National Library, that what we have\r\nwaited for over 20 years and what we have been dreaming about has come\r\nto pass at last. After serving my term on the Publishing Board--this is\r\nmy valedictory--I feel to-day that I must say just this: Now that we\r\nhave reached this point, that every one has hoped for so long, we must\r\nsee to it that this agency is utilized and appreciated. Every one of us\r\nought to watch those printed cards, and make suggestions as to their\r\nuse. If we utilize them, and prove their value and their economy, we can\r\nrely on the great support of the National Library in many other\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThe secretary read a letter from the Hon. Secretary of the\r\n\r\n\r\n               LIBRARY ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM,\r\n\r\ninviting the A. L. A. to be represented at its annual meeting, to be\r\nheld in Plymouth, England, Aug. 27-30, 1901; and, on recommendation from\r\nthe Council, it was voted that members of the A. L. A. abroad at the\r\ntime of the English meeting be authorized to represent the American\r\nLibrary Association on that occasion.\r\n\r\nThe president announced that the polls would be open for\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ELECTION OF OFFICERS\r\n\r\nin the library exhibit room at the Fountain House from 8 to 10 Tuesday\r\nevening, and that J. I. Wyer and J. G. Moulton would serve as tellers.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of F. J. TEGGART, chairman, the secretary read the\r\n\r\n\r\n         REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\nSince its appointment this committee has worked steadily towards the\r\naccomplishment of the object of the handbook. Specifically this object\r\nis the collection of the statistics, history and bibliography of all\r\nlibraries in the United States having 10,000 or more volumes on Dec. 31,\r\n1900.\r\n\r\nWhile about 80 per cent. of the circulars sent out in 1899 were\r\nreturned, the cases in which the bibliographical and historical data was\r\nsupplied were too few in number to be of much assistance. The work which\r\nhas therefore fallen on the chairman of this committee is neither more\r\nor less than the preparation of a check list of all the publications of\r\nAmerican libraries. The need of this work must be apparent to any\r\nlibrarian who considers that there is at present no bibliographical\r\nsource in which information regarding library publications may be found.\r\nThe \"American catalogue,\" for example, ignores such publications\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nIn beginning this work the chairman of your committee indexed the set of\r\nthe _Library Journal_ and all available bulletins and catalogs of\r\nlibraries for library publications, and cataloged the similar material\r\nexisting in the libraries of San Francisco. Approximately the list now\r\nincludes between 8000 and 9000 cards.\r\n\r\nThis large body of material has been reduced to shape, and the greater\r\npart has been typewritten on sheets. What now remains to be done is\r\nthat some person conversant with the library literature of a state or\r\ncity should take the sheets representing that district and carefully\r\ncompare the entries with the books themselves, supplying omissions and\r\ncorrecting errors. This certainly is no light piece of work, but it is\r\nessential to the success of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe historical notices have been prepared in part, but the statistics\r\nobtained in 1899 must of necessity be renewed to bring the entire work\r\ndown to the end of the century.\r\n\r\nAs the manuscript can be completed by Jan. 1 next, there is every reason\r\nto believe that this large piece of work can be presented in completed\r\nform to the Association in 1902, with one proviso. When the committee\r\nwas appointed in 1899 it was given a general authorization to incur\r\nexpenditure--in fact, without doing so no work could have been done.\r\nAgain, in 1900, an authorization for expenditure was passed by the\r\nAssociation. Up to the present the chairman of the committee has\r\nexpended directly on this work on postage and printing about $150. Owing\r\napparently to the general terms in which the authorizations for\r\nexpenditure were made at previous meetings, the officers of the\r\nAssociation have not so far made any appropriation towards this amount,\r\nand it would seem proper that some definite provision should be made by\r\nthe Association at this meeting to cover a part at least of this\r\nexpenditure if the handbook is to be considered an \"A. L. A.\"\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n                                     FREDERICK J. TEGGART, _Chairman_.\r\n\r\nC. W. ANDREWS: As the third member of the committee, I may supplement\r\nthis report, and state that the matter of obtaining the consent of the\r\nBureau of Education to undertake the publication of this handbook was\r\nleft to me, and that I have pleasure in informing the Association that\r\nthere seems every prospect that at least a portion of this material will\r\nbe published by the Bureau of Education, and that we may hope to have\r\nmade available in this way a much-needed tool for practical use and a\r\nmass of information which cannot fail to be of value outside of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nW. I. FLETCHER: The matter of the publication of this handbook was\r\nreferred to the Publishing Board, but if the plan for its publication by\r\nthe government is carried out, the Publishing Board understands that\r\nwill take the publication out of its hands. I move that the executive\r\nboard be requested to inquire into the matter of the expense incurred by\r\nMr. Teggart, and provide for meeting it, if this is found possible.\r\n_Voted._\r\n\r\nThe secretary read the by-laws to the constitution, prepared by special\r\ncommittee and adopted by the Council, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BY-LAWS.\r\n\r\n §1.

Provisions shall be made by the executive board for sessions of\r\n the various sections at annual meetings of the Association, and the\r\n programs for the same shall be prepared by the officers of sections in\r\n consultation with the program committee. Sessions of sections shall be\r\n open to any member of the Association, but no person may vote in any\r\n section unless registered as a member of the same. The registered\r\n members of each section shall, at the final session of each annual\r\n meeting, choose a chairman and secretary, to serve until the close of\r\n the next annual meeting.\r\n\r\nDr. J. K. HOSMER reported for the committee on\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MEMORIAL TO JOHN FISKE.\r\n\r\nDr. HOSMER: The committee to whom this matter was referred thought it\r\nbest to prepare, instead of a formal preamble and resolution, a minute\r\nto be entered upon the Proceedings of the convention. That received the\r\napproval of the Council. The minute is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The news having reached us of the untimely death of John Fiske, once\r\nour professional associate, we, the American Library Association, desire\r\nto make record of our profound grief at the departure of a writer who\r\nwas a dominant force in American literature, and to express our sense\r\nthat in this passing of a great thinker, historian, and spiritual\r\nleader, our land and our time have sustained irreparable loss.\"\r\n\r\nPresident CARR: This minute will be spread upon the record of the\r\nProceedings, having taken the regular course.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CO-OPERATIVE LIST OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS.\r\n\r\nC. R. PERRY: At the last session of the Children's Librarians' Section\r\naction was taken looking towards a co-operative list of books for\r\nchildren. There were some features connected with it that were of such a\r\ngeneral character that we thought it essential that the plan come before\r\nthe Association in general session, to secure proper authority for us to\r\nproceed with the work; furthermore, there was no further session of the\r\nChildren's Librarians' Section, so if a report was made at all it would\r\nhave to be made to the A. L. A. in general session. The report is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_To the American Library Association_:\r\n\r\n At the last session of the Children's Librarians' Section a committee\r\n was appointed to formulate some plan whereby a co-operative list of\r\n children's books may be produced, this committee to report at some\r\n general session. We now are ready and beg leave to report progress.\r\n\r\n We have interviewed over 50 members of the A. L. A. within the last two\r\n days, and find a general desire for such a list. Moreover, the people\r\n interviewed have expressed their willingness to subscribe among\r\n themselves a sum of money necessary to cover the cost of preparing such\r\n list (postage, typewriting, stationery, printing, etc.).\r\n\r\n Your committee have found that one or two days are hardly sufficient to\r\n enable us to bring our plan into perfection. We desire very strongly to\r\n accomplish the results for which we were appointed, and therefore ask\r\n for more time. We do respectfully recommend and ask that authority be\r\n given to our committee to proceed with the following plan:\r\n\r\n(1) Committee on co-operative children's list to appoint six people to\r\n     collect the subscriptions which have been promised.\r\n\r\n (2) Some one experienced and well-known librarian to be appointed by\r\n      our committee to undertake the preparation of the said list.\r\n\r\n (3) When such person has been appointed and has accepted, the money\r\n      raised to be turned over to that librarian.\r\n\r\n (4) Our committee to suggest to the person undertaking this work a plan\r\n     whereby not only may be secured the approval or disapproval of\r\n     librarians and teachers as to the books of the tentative list, but\r\n     also a report as to the manner in which these books have been\r\n     received by the children in all parts of the nation.\r\n\r\n (5) A final and definite report to be submitted at the next conference.\r\n      This report to include the books generally accepted and those\r\n      rejected as well.\r\n        Respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n                                         CHESLEY R. PERRY, _Chairman_,\r\n                                          J. C. DANA,\r\n                                          ELIZA G. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nPresident CARR: This report comes before you in the nature of a\r\nrecommendation, and suitable action would be to move that the\r\nAssociation appoint a general committee to carry out the recommendations\r\nof the report. That committee might consist of the members of the\r\npresent committee, who drew this report--Mr. Perry, Mr. Dana and Miss\r\nBrowning.\r\n\r\nR. R. BOWKER: Is not this a matter which should come under the\r\njurisdiction of the Publishing Board? It would then give this proposed\r\ncommittee somewhat the relation to the Publishing Board that is borne by\r\nthe advisory committee on printed catalog cards. Otherwise we might have\r\na confusion of results.\r\n\r\nMr. PERRY: That matter was discussed, but we felt that we were preparing\r\nsomething which at the next convention might be submitted to the\r\nAssociation, and then referred to the Publishing Board. We are not\r\nexpecting to prepare a list for general printing and circulation, but a\r\nlist which may be brought up at the next conference as something\r\ndefinite to be referred to the Publishing Board.\r\n\r\nIt was _Voted_, That the committee acting for the Children's Librarians'\r\nSection be appointed to carry out the work outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PRINTED CATALOG CARDS.\r\n\r\nHERBERT PUTNAM: I ask your indulgence, Mr. President, for a few words.\r\nThe readiness of the Library of Congress to take up the work of\r\nsupplying printed cards has been stated. For the Library of Congress, I\r\nwish to say that we do not repudiate anything of what has been stated as\r\nto our readiness; it must be understood, however, that we are justified\r\nin entering upon this undertaking only in case it presents a reasonable\r\nprobability of success. Now, for that probability three elements are\r\nessential. First, some body that should represent judgment and\r\nexperience, in such co-operative work, and be in touch with the\r\ninterests at large of the Library Association. That body is furnished by\r\nthe Publishing Board. Second, there was necessary some office that was\r\ndirectly in relation with the publishers of this country. That office is\r\nthe _Publishers' Weekly_, and the _Publishers' Weekly_ has generously\r\noffered to place at our disposal all of its facilities for securing\r\nprompt information as to every recent publication. Third, there is a\r\nstrong probability that during the first year at least there will be\r\nsome deficit, while the experiment is merely beginning. That danger has\r\nbeen met. Mr. Bowker, personally, has tendered a guaranty amounting, if\r\nnecessary, to $1000, to meet the possible deficit of the undertaking\r\nduring the present calendar year. Repudiating nothing of what has been\r\nsaid about the readiness of the Library of Congress to serve in this\r\nundertaking, I nevertheless wish this matter to appear in its proper\r\nproportions, and we should not be willing to have these other elements\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of THORVALD SOLBERG, J. C. HANSON read Mr. Solberg's\r\npaper on\r\n\r\n                            BOOK COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 24.)\r\n\r\nGEORGE ILES read a paper on\r\n\r\n                     THE TRUSTEESHIP OF LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 16.)\r\n\r\nMr. ILES: I may add, that when I was in England three years ago and\r\ntalked about this scheme, one or two asked me, \"Who is going to meet\r\nyour libel suits?\" I explained that there was already a very large body\r\nof responsible critics who contribute in this country, especially in\r\nthis field; as, for instance, the critics of the _American Historical\r\nReview_, and the notes that I have in mind are very much of the color of\r\nthe notes one reads in such reviews--not many of them very black, not\r\nmany of them very white; most of them a whitey brown. I have never heard\r\nyet of any libel suits against the editors of the _American Historical\r\nReview_, even when their reviews have not been particularly amiable. I\r\ndo not think we need to dread any litigation. Mr. Larned went to work in\r\norganizing his staff of contributors with great caution and good\r\njudgment. He did not choose them from any one particular university, but\r\nwhen he heard that at University \"A\" there was a man who was\r\nacknowledged to know the literature of the Columbian period of American\r\nhistory better than anybody else, he sought to enlist that man. And Mr.\r\nLarned has been limited, of course, in various ways that you can readily\r\nunderstand, as for instance when sometimes a contributor has given him\r\nnotes which he has felt obliged to discard. And let me say also that in\r\nthe main the most important work has been done by the professors of\r\nhistory in the colleges and universities, except for the period of the\r\nCivil War, where the late General Cox, who had made a special study of\r\nthat field, was his contributor. Mr. Larned's idea is simply to find\r\nthroughout this country in any particular field--the Civil War period,\r\nor the pre-Columbian period, or the settlement of the Northwest period,\r\nor the war of 1812--the most authoritative and trustworthy man and\r\nenlarge his audience to take in all the readers and students in this\r\ncountry, instead of having him speak merely to the students of a\r\nparticular university or to the readers of a particular review.\r\n\r\nDr. RICHARD T. ELY read a paper on the same subject.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 22.)\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Can't we have a word from Mr. Thwaites on this question?\r\n\r\nR. G. THWAITES: I do not suppose I ought to speak on this matter, for I\r\nam one of Mr. Larned's contributors. I have done a good deal of\r\nannotation, or evaluation, of this sort, upon request; I have a fair\r\nacquaintance with reviewers, and have done a good deal of reviewing\r\nmyself. I know the limitations of reviewers, and there is, I think, a\r\ngreat deal of truth in what Dr. Ely says. I always want to know, when I\r\nread a review, who wrote the review; after I know the individual who has\r\nwritten the review, I make up my mind more or less regarding its\r\nverdict. Often, in writing annotations for this work of Mr. Larned's I\r\nhave felt the very serious responsibility which rested upon me as an\r\nindividual contributor, in seeming to crystallize judgment for\r\ngenerations perhaps--if this book is to be used for generations--and the\r\npossible harm that might result from such crystallization. I know that\r\nmy point of view will be entirely different from another man's point of\r\nview. You take four or five men and ask them to write a note on the same\r\nbook for this annotated list, and you will have four or five different\r\njudgments--absolutely, radically different. It is perhaps, a dangerous\r\nthing to crystallize these judgments; and yet, after all, I sympathize\r\nvery greatly with Mr. Iles' position. I think the thing should be done.\r\nLibrarians are asked for such judgments all the time. All of us who\r\nwrite text-books are continually asked for annotated bibliographies for\r\nstudents to follow, and we are always passing judgments--other people\r\nmight call them \"snap\" judgments--upon various books. Great wisdom is\r\nnecessary in this matter. For instance, the other day Mr. Larned sent a\r\nnote to two of us who are contributing to this annotated bibliography.\r\nIt happened through some editorial mistake that two notes, asking for\r\ncomment on a certain book, were written to different individuals. It was\r\nDr. Davis Dewey, of the Institute of Technology, who happened to cross\r\nmy path and wrote a note on the same book. Now we had two absolutely\r\ndifferent opinions about this book. And yet it was very natural. I had\r\nlooked at this book as the story of an exploring tour down the\r\nMississippi valley; he had looked at it as a study in sociology from an\r\neconomic standpoint. It was exceedingly interesting from my standpoint;\r\nit was filled with fallacies and whims from the standpoint of an\r\neconomist and sociologist. Well, I threw up my note and let his stand.\r\nWhat are we going to do about it? Some work of this kind ought to be\r\ndone, because it is most useful; but after all, I think Dr. Ely's word\r\nof warning is one that we should take to heart very thoroughly.\r\nPersonally I really don't know whether we ought to \"evaluate\" literature\r\nor not; and yet I am doing it all the time.\r\n\r\nMr. ILES: We expect that this bibliography of Mr. Larned's, and any\r\nothers in the same series which may follow, will appear also in card\r\nform, and I very much desire when the central bureau finds that a\r\nparticular note can be replaced by a better one, in the light of further\r\ndevelopments, that that particular note should be withdrawn, and a\r\nbetter and more nearly just note be substituted; all gratuitously to the\r\nsubscribing libraries.\r\n\r\nF. M. CRUNDEN: I realize the force of what Dr. Ely has said, but I still\r\nbelieve that this work is worth doing, because it is exceedingly\r\nvaluable to us. We have got to have some guide. We cannot all of us read\r\nin all lines and so far as the contradictory notes referred to go, it\r\nseems to me that all that was necessary was for the editor to apply to\r\nthose two divergent notes just the remark that Mr. Thwaites made--that\r\none was written from the standpoint of the sociologist and economist,\r\nthe other from that of the historian and geographer. From one side it\r\nwas a good book; from the other side a bad book.\r\n\r\nMr. PUTNAM: I speak on such a subject as this with very great\r\nreluctance, and yet, as a librarian who has had occasion in times past\r\nto select--I do not have so much occasion now, because so much matter\r\ncomes to us without inspection--I wish to draw a distinction between\r\nselection and exclusion. Now, when Dr. Ely speaks of an _index librorum\r\nprohibitorum_ or an _index expurgatorius_, the implication is that the\r\nlibraries of this country, on advice or of their own motion without\r\nadvice, are deliberately excluding from their collection books of which\r\nthey disapprove. The librarian, however, approaches the matter in an\r\nentirely different way. He has at his disposal, for purchase, a very\r\nlimited sum of money; a very limited sum of money, no matter how large\r\nhis library, for the amount of literature put upon the market is\r\npractically limitless. Men of science themselves, after contending for\r\nliberty of expression, do not always use that liberty with discretion or\r\nto the advantage of the community. Now, there must be a selection. That\r\nis the point we start from as librarians; that is the duty laid upon\r\nus--to get, with the means at our command, the books that will be most\r\nuseful to our constituents. Now, that means choice. How are we to make a\r\nchoice? I do not believe there is a librarian in the United States who\r\nwould set himself up as an arbiter or an expert in every department of\r\nliterature; who would claim to determine the value of doctrine, either\r\nin religion or in economics, the two departments of literature as to\r\nwhich the discrimination must be most difficult and most dangerous; and\r\nyet even in those departments we must choose. That means a selection.\r\nWhat is the alternative, in case we have no guide? What would Dr. Ely\r\noffer us? Dr. Ely, of course, as any university professor, has his\r\nstudents, who are studying not merely one subject in which they wish to\r\nget the best and final opinion, but all opinions, from which they are to\r\ndraw conclusions. Now, the duty of the librarian is simply to represent\r\nall opinions, and not his own opinion, or his notion of the best\r\nopinion, or somebody else's notion of the best opinion; but, given a\r\ndoctrine which is important, which is attracting attention, he assumes\r\nthat this doctrine must be represented in his collection. It is only a\r\nquestion of what represents this doctrine best--not whether the doctrine\r\nis right or wrong. If there is a book regarding which there are two\r\nopinions, the appraisal may give the two opinions, as all appraisals\r\nshould, so far as it can be done. The substance of what I wish to say is\r\nthis: our duty is not one of exclusion; it is one of selection, and that\r\nfact is as little understood as any element in library administration\r\nto-day--and I am sorry to say that the misunderstanding is apt to be\r\ncountenanced by the librarian. Take for instance the case of the Boston\r\nPublic Library, berated all over the country for excluding certain books\r\nfrom its collection. Now, the Boston Public Library deliberately\r\nexcludes, to my knowledge, almost no book. Its process is of selection.\r\nIt receives about seven hundred volumes of recent fiction a year, to\r\nconsider for purchase. It believes that it is for the best interests of\r\nits constituents to buy less than two hundred titles and multiply\r\ncopies. Now, how is it going to dispose of the other five hundred? They\r\nare neither rebuked, disapproved of or placed in an index. They are\r\nsimply left out, because in the process of selection, the first two\r\nhundred seem most useful for the purpose of the library.\r\n\r\nDr. ELY: I was not thinking about the librarians in my remarks. They\r\nmust, of course, make their selections of books, but what I had in mind\r\nwas the bringing, especially in the form of a card catalog, these\r\njudgments and these appraisals before the reading public all over the\r\nentire country, and so possibly forming opinion, along one line.\r\nFormerly librarians have had a great many facilities to aid them in\r\nmaking this selection of which Mr. Putnam has spoken. They have had the\r\nvarious periodicals with their reviews; they could read these and base\r\ntheir selections upon these. I had especially in mind the objections to\r\ncrystallizing opinion and bringing a one-sided opinion, or one kind of\r\nan opinion, before the entire United States, instead of having opinions\r\nof one sort in one place and opinions of another sort in another place.\r\nAlso, it is the impartial nature, or the apparently impartial nature, of\r\nthe proposed \"evaluations\" which seems to me especially objectionable.\r\nOf course, in our college classrooms, we give our estimates of books,\r\nbut Professor A will give one estimate, and then the students go to\r\nProfessor B's class-room, and they hear another estimate, so that they\r\nsoon learn the personal inclinations and preferences of the various\r\nprofessors, and can soon offer some explanation of the conditions and\r\nthe circumstances under which these estimates are formed. And the views\r\nexpressed in one university are criticised very largely by another\r\nuniversity. Not so I take it with the person who ordinarily consults the\r\ncard catalog of a public library.\r\n\r\nR. R. BOWKER: May I take a moment from my own paper to say just a word\r\non this subject? Questions are asked of the librarians, and they must be\r\nanswered. To answer them in the fullest light instead of the scantiest\r\nis, as I understand, the purpose of what Mr. Iles calls \"evaluation.\" If\r\nMiss Smith--I think there are six of her, so that my remarks are not\r\npersonal--comes from the library school, or after the library school\r\ntraining, to a public library desk, she is sure to be asked questions,\r\nwe will say, in American history. There may be an information clerk to\r\nrefer them to, or there may not; but, as I understand, this work of Mr.\r\nIles is intended, not to exclude other sources of information, but to\r\ngive Miss Smith opportunity to inquire and obtain the best and widest\r\navailable information as to the character of a particular book, or as to\r\nits rating. If this book were to be the sole and exclusive authority,\r\nthen of course we might have a censorship in literature, but I do not\r\nunderstand that in the minds of the promotors of this plan there is any\r\nsuch design to make an exclusive and solely authoritative work.\r\n\r\nW. MILLARD PALMER read a paper on\r\n\r\n      THE RELATIONSHIP OF PUBLISHERS, BOOKSELLERS, AND LIBRARIANS.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 31.)\r\n\r\nR. R. BOWKER: There is, or should be, I take it, a large purpose common\r\nto all who have to deal with books, as intermediaries between the author\r\nand the reader, whether from the altruistic side, as the librarian, or\r\nfrom the commercial side, as the publisher and bookseller. We are\r\nfamiliar with one expression of that purpose, to get \"the best reading\r\nfor the largest number at the least cost\"; and I, for one, am firmly of\r\nthe opinion that that function is properly shared by the two classes of\r\nwhom I have spoken, that they are not in competition but in\r\nco-operation; I mean the librarian and the bookseller. It is a narrow\r\nview, it would seem, which puts the two in opposition, or even in the\r\nposition of competitors. And just as it seems that the bookseller is\r\nwrong in feeling that the librarian is interfering with his business, so\r\nI think it is wrong for the librarian to feel that the bookseller should\r\nin any way be limited or hampered or belittled in his kind of work of\r\ngetting books to the people. It seems to me a truism, indeed, that there\r\nis one thing better than a book loaned, and that is a book owned. The\r\nideal library community is, after all, one in which the people are so\r\nwell supplied with books in their own homes that the function of the\r\nlibrary is not so much a great circulation, however fine that may look\r\nin the statistics, but rather that of guide and helper to readers in the\r\nselection, and, if you please, in the \"evaluation\" of books. The board\r\nof health in a city or in a state is, perhaps, a fair illustration of\r\nthe final function of the librarian; a health board, in its ideal, is a\r\nbody to promote sanitation, to warn people against errors, to get rid of\r\nthe mistake that tuberculosis is a hereditary disease from which people\r\nhave to suffer, instead of one which is communicated and which can be\r\navoided; rather than a body to furnish free medical attendance like a\r\ndispensary. So I start with the proposition, that it is desirable for\r\nlibrarians, for public librarians, as such, to encourage most of all the\r\nformation and owning of private libraries throughout their bailiwicks.\r\n\r\nNow, there has been one difficulty of late years in bringing about this\r\nresult, in the most effective way, and that difficulty has been felt not\r\nonly in this country, but throughout most countries--the fact that\r\ncompetition, not in quality but in \"cut rate\" price, has practically\r\ntaken away the living of the commercial intermediary in the\r\ndistribution of books, the hire of the laborer who is working in that\r\nparticular vineyard. That has been true in Germany, in France, in\r\nEngland, and in this country. It has not prevented the sale of books; it\r\n_seems_ not to have limited the sale of books; but it is probably true\r\nthat the dissemination of the best literature among the mass of the\r\npeople, in private libraries, while it has been immensely improved by\r\nthe library system, has not been promoted by the bookselling system\r\nunder present conditions as it should be. In Germany, a movement has\r\nbeen on foot for a few years past, and has been quite successful, to\r\ngive that particular kind of librarian, the bookseller, a fee more\r\nworthy of his function; a profit which makes it possible for him to keep\r\nthat sort of library which is distributed into private libraries,\r\n_i.e._, the book store. In France a very curious difficulty is in\r\nillustration. There the price of books had come to be very low, so low\r\nthat when a rise in the price of paper came, the publisher's business\r\nwas found to be almost impossible. The remedy naturally took the shape\r\nof a general rise in price, a considerable rise in price in cheaper\r\nbooks, sufficient to meet that particular difficulty and to make\r\npossible at the same time a better recompense, a living wage, to the\r\nintermediary. Now, the whole tendency of modern industrial development\r\nis to get rid of the intermediary as much as possible; _i. e._, to have\r\nas few steps, of person and of cost, between the producer and the\r\nconsumer as is practicable. This we may take as fundamental to-day. It\r\nremains true, nevertheless, that there must, as a rule, be somebody\r\nbetween the producer and the consumer, between the person in the great\r\nmanufacturing center and the remote distributing points on the\r\ncircumference to bring the thing wanted to the person who wants it; and\r\nit is only in view of that requirement that the bookseller is to be\r\nconsidered. In that sense, as I have said, he seems a complement of the\r\nlibrarian, and the book store the complement of the library. Now, a\r\nlibrarian cannot live without salary, though many live on very small\r\nsalaries, in the hope of better things--and one of the accomplishments\r\nof the American Library Association has been to bring better things to\r\nthe librarian. Both the dignity and the emolument of the library\r\nprofession have been, I believe, increased greatly by the existence of\r\nthis Association. The librarian receives a salary, and it is not true,\r\nas we all know, that books can be circulated freely from public\r\nlibraries in the sense of their being circulated without cost. Indeed,\r\nwe have occasion to lament often that the cost of circulating a single\r\nvolume is so great. It is a fair question whether the cost of shelving,\r\npreparing for the public, and in many cases, of circulating a volume, is\r\nnot greater than the fee which the bookseller asks as his profit, his\r\nwage in transferring that volume from the publisher to the reader.\r\nTherefore it seems to me that the suggestion of which Mr. Dewey is the\r\napostle, that the public library should take the place of the book\r\nstore, that it should exhibit recent books to the public and take the\r\npublic's orders for those books, rests both on an economic and on a\r\nsocial fallacy. In a word, work cannot be done for nothing, and whether\r\nthat work is paid for by the public in the shape of salaries or by the\r\nprivate buyer in the shape of profits is a matter of comparison.\r\n\r\nAbout the time at which the A. L. A. was organized, in 1876, there was\r\nan attempt on the part of the book trade to deal with this question, and\r\nat Philadelphia, in 1876, a meeting was held at which a reform plan was\r\ninitiated. That plan, it seemed to me then as it seems to me now,\r\ninvolved a fundamental mistake, in that it did not deal with the\r\nquestion of published prices. It is evident that books cannot be\r\nincreased in price, unless there is a specific reason in the price of\r\npaper or some such reason, without interference with their sale and wide\r\ndistribution. It is poor policy for the publisher to limit the sale of\r\nhis ware by putting a higher price on it than the traffic will bear. At\r\nthat meeting it was proposed not to alter the published prices of books,\r\nbut to recognize formally the custom of giving twenty per cent. discount\r\nto the retail buyer. The reform proceeded upon that basis, and the\r\nsystem presently broke down. Within a year past there have been shaped\r\ntwo organizations, the American Publishers' Association and the American\r\nBooksellers' Association, which are working in harmony on another plan.\r\nThat plan is that new books, new copyright books (fiction and some\r\nspecial classes excepted for the time), should be published at a price\r\nwhich recognizes the fact that the published price hitherto has not been\r\nthe real or standard price. In other words, a book which was priced at\r\n$1.50 it is expected to publish at twenty per cent., more or less, below\r\nthat price, and to make a $1.50 book, say, $1.25 or $1.20; a $2 book\r\n$1.60 or $1.50, and a $1 book 75 or 80 cents. This plan recognizes the\r\nexisting situation, and the proposal is that the plan shall be enforced\r\nby the publishers declining to supply books to booksellers who fail to\r\nmaintain those standard prices. The plan has worked out with other\r\nclasses of specially owned articles, in that respect similar to books,\r\nand it has worked with fair success.\r\n\r\nThere is only one exception which the bookseller is permitted under the\r\nproposed regulations to make, and that is a discount to the library.\r\nThat discount is limited to ten per cent., and I think it should fairly\r\nbe stated that this may increase, perhaps by five or ten per cent., the\r\nactual prices which some libraries, at least, have been paying for their\r\nbooks. That is a disadvantage from the library point of view which must\r\nbe faced. I do not know that it will increase the price in the case of\r\nlibraries generally. In the case of the public, it has been true that\r\nwhile many have paid the lower price for the books, others have been\r\nasked the full published price, so that there has been an inequality of\r\nprice where the person best equipped in one sense, least equipped in\r\nanother, has had the advantage of the lower price. In other words, the\r\nperson who had most books and knew most about them, got the book at a\r\nvery low price, and the person who was really most in need of the book,\r\nbecause he knew less, had to pay the full price for it. I do not believe\r\nmyself that that is the right or a good way of doing business. It would\r\nnot be the method which you would permit in libraries, of treating one\r\nperson differently from another, because the fundamental proposition of\r\nthis Association is that the public should be treated equally and\r\njustly. Take it altogether, I for one believe that although in some\r\ncases there may be this slight rise in cost to the library, the whole\r\nlibrary situation, or, I should say, the whole book situation, would be\r\nso much improved by the proposed change that it would be to the general\r\nadvantage of the libraries to suffer that specific disadvantage.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a good deal of grasping in human nature, and it\r\nmight be very wise for the American Library Association, in one sense\r\nrepresenting the public, to come into official relation with this matter\r\nand be the guardian of the buying interests, to the extent of making\r\nsure that there is a real reduction in the prices of books on this\r\nscheme. The large-minded publishers will doubtless see their interests\r\nin making the reduction throughout on the copyright books which are to\r\nbe published on this plan. There are others who may not see this\r\nadvantage, and who may attempt, under the new plan, to set as high a\r\nprice on the book as under the old plan. If we had a committee of this\r\nAssociation on relations with the book trade, it might be possible for\r\nsuch a committee, known to be on the alert, to prevent or remedy cases\r\nof that sort, and I trust such a committee will be appointed by this\r\nbody, or by its Council, as I shall take the liberty of moving.\r\n\r\nI should feel some hesitancy in speaking to this Association from the\r\ntwo points of view, of relation with the book trade and of relation with\r\nthe library interests; _i.e._, of speaking as the editor of the\r\n_Publishers' Weekly_ and as the editor of the _Library Journal_, but for\r\nthe fact that I believe the interests to be one. I may, however, make\r\nthe personal explanation that while it seems to me that a journalist\r\ncannot write that in which he does not believe, on the other hand, a\r\njournalist who is responsible for the conduct of a representative\r\njournal cannot interpolate his own opinion to the exclusion of the\r\nopinion of the class whom he is supposed to represent; for that reason I\r\nhave taken the position in my own office that in case the library\r\ninterests should come in conflict with the publishing interests, I will\r\ngive over that particular subject to some librarian, who, using the\r\neditorial columns of the _Library Journal_, will represent\r\ndistinctively, free from any interest in the book trade, the views of\r\nthe Library Association and of the library interests at large. I take\r\nthis opportunity to say that in case the opinion of this Association is\r\nadverse to the plan which I have been outlining, the _Library Journal_\r\nwill take that course in presenting fairly and fully the views of the\r\nprofession. When the whole question is threshed out; when such a\r\ncommittee has discussed, perhaps with the publishers' association\r\nitself, whether there should not be a somewhat greater discount to the\r\nlibrarian, to equalize the old rates; when such a committee expostulates\r\nwith individual publishers against an abuse of this plan, I believe that\r\nthe result will be, on the whole, to promote the wide and useful\r\ndissemination of books, and I trust that any action which is taken, if\r\naction should be taken by the Association or by its Council, will be in\r\nview of the wider co-operation in which these two interests should work.\r\nLet me remind you that the bookseller cannot live without earning his\r\nliving any more than the librarian, and it is not quite fair perhaps for\r\nthose of us who are protected by salaries to impeach the fair living\r\nwhich the bookseller earns in another way. The book store should exist\r\nin every community, alongside the library. We know as a matter of fact\r\nthat even our large cities, certainly our small cities, even more our\r\ntowns, are very ill equipped with book stores; that in many places they\r\nare notable for their absence rather than for their presence. This\r\nelement of active work in the distribution of books should, I believe,\r\ncome back more to our American life. It cannot come back, apparently,\r\nunder present conditions, and any movement, it seems to me, should have\r\nthe helping hand of the A. L. A. that tends to put the American\r\nbookseller on a plane with the librarian as an agent for the\r\ndissemination of the best books at the least cost to the most people,\r\nand I emphasize \"at the least cost,\" meaning the least cost at which the\r\nservice can be rightfully performed.\r\n\r\nAdjourned at 12.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _SIXTH SESSION._\r\n\r\n          (FOUNTAIN SPRING HOUSE, TUESDAY AFTERNOON, JULY 9.)\r\n\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 2.15 p.m. by President CARR, who\r\nannounced that the discussion would be continued from the morning\r\nsession, on the subject\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE RELATIONSHIP OF PUBLISHERS, BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIANS.\r\n\r\nMELVIL DEWEY: There seems to be an impression on the part of some that\r\nthe attitude I have taken in regard to this question is for the sake of\r\nstarting up discussion. I am quite sincere in what I say and in what I\r\nbelieve in regard to it. In the first place, I think nothing could be\r\nmore unfortunate than for any of us to get into an attitude of\r\nantagonism with the publishers and booksellers. There was something like\r\nthat twenty-five years ago; their organization and ours began at the\r\nsame time. There were some who wanted to fight with the booksellers and\r\npublishers. I think that is all wrong. I am heartily in sympathy with\r\nnearly everything that Mr. Bowker said this morning, and with what has\r\nappeared in the columns of the _Publishers' Weekly_. I read every page\r\nof it. I believe so profoundly in the value of the bookman's work that,\r\nwhen formulating definitions of our university studies, as to what a\r\nfull-fledged university should be, I insisted it should include\r\npublishing research and publication, not only the preservation of\r\nlearning. It is because I have so profound a respect for what may be\r\ndone by the book trade, as we call it, that I believe in these things.\r\nBut the discussion this morning seemed to be very much on the line of\r\nRuskin's attack on railroads, which he said always were devices of the\r\ndevil, and he said it very eloquently. You heard the same talk about the\r\ntrolley lines--about the whitening bones of the young innocents that had\r\nbeen killed by them. We were assured that bicycles were to destroy the\r\nhorse trade entirely, yet horses now bring double what they did before.\r\nTwenty-five years ago, I remember a very prominent man most earnestly\r\npointing out just what was pointed out this morning--that the A. L. A.\r\nand the public libraries were simply devices to injure the interests of\r\npublishers and booksellers. And the attitude of men on these things is\r\nbased on what Mr. Bowker called \"an economic and social fallacy.\" I like\r\nthe phrase; only he was fitting it to me, and I fit it to him, and it is\r\nfor you to decide which is right. The question hinges on what we\r\nunderstand the library to be. If the library is like a blacksmith shop,\r\nor shoe store, or something of that kind, then he is right. If the\r\nlibrary is an essential part in our system of education and a necessity\r\nfor our civilization, then I am right. In New York we still have the\r\nplank road and the toll-gate, and we are just taking them over for\r\npublic use--buying them and abolishing the tolls, so that the public's\r\nright to use the roads has come back to them. All the arguments we heard\r\nthis morning would fit the question of abolishing the toll-roads. A\r\ngreat many people keep no horses. Why should they be taxed to maintain\r\nthe roads? We have the fire department. We do not tax only the people\r\nwhose houses are on fire. It is a public necessity. We have the best\r\nillustration of the case in our schools. The tax-supported high school\r\nhas killed off a number of private schools, and estimable people who\r\nwere earning their living that way were thrown out of employment. And\r\nthe tax-supported high school is in analogy with the public library. It\r\nhas offered instruction free and has ruined the business of others. It\r\nis so with many professional schools. A transition has been going on\r\nvery rapidly. The last big fight we have been having is over the\r\nbusiness colleges, some of which are directed by mere charlatans, and\r\nothers by those who are giving admirable instruction, doing their work\r\nwell. But they have outlived their time. The public demanded that\r\ncertain instruction of this kind should be made available cheaply to all\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nNow, we have been charged with wanting to abolish the bookseller. I\r\nnever said anything about abolishing him. It is like saying that because\r\nthe tadpole is going to be a frog we are abolishing the tadpoles. It is\r\nnature that does it; it is a matter of growth. Or it is like saying that\r\nthe entomologist in pointing out that the moth is going to develop into\r\nthe butterfly, is abolishing all the moths. So the good booksellers, if\r\nthey go on with the work of supplying the public with good reading, will\r\ndo it through the agency of the public library, where they can do it\r\ncheaper. When we are sure that a certain thing ought to be done; that it\r\nis a good thing; and, secondly, when we are sure that it can be done\r\ncheaper than in any other way, we are not inclined to waste a great deal\r\nof time theorizing over anybody's philosophy as to whether it is a\r\nproper thing to do or not. We want the right things done in the best and\r\ncheapest way. I am sorry to see the old-time bookseller, who did good\r\nwork, crowded out of the field. I do not see any way in which he can\r\nsave himself, except in the largest cities. I am sorry to see a great\r\nmany of the old schools, the secondary schools, crowded out of business\r\nand entirely replaced by the tax-supported schools. I do not understand\r\nthat it is our purpose, either in this Association, or in life, to be\r\nstudying how we are going to feed every man after the system which has\r\nfed him up to the present time is abolished. If the man is good for\r\nanything, he will earn his wages; and it is utterly fallacious to say a\r\nthing is wrong because somebody is going to lose his business. When the\r\nrailroad was built a great many worthy men who drove stage coaches were\r\ndriven out of business in just that way. Every modern improvement does\r\nthat; new machinery of all kinds has the effect of driving people out of\r\nemployment; but, in the long run, it pays.\r\n\r\nI ought to say in the first place that the suggestion that the librarian\r\nwould sell books for a profit is one of those queer things that crop out\r\nin connection with all great movements. I never yet heard of any library\r\nthat was buying books and distributing them. I believe that the library\r\nwill order books in connection with other work. My thesis is this: the\r\nbook owned is a great deal better than the book loaned. I believe it is\r\nbetter for a man to own a book than to borrow it; that it is legitimate,\r\nat public expense, to show him that book in the library and hand it to\r\nhim as his book--just as legitimate an expense, every way, as it is to\r\nemploy a man to sell people books so that they won't patronize the\r\nBooklovers' Library. I think the whole thing hinges there. It is not a\r\nmatter of theory, but of fact. If that is what we want to accomplish,\r\ncan we do it best with the book store or with the library? I contend\r\nthat it is impossible to rehabilitate the old bookseller, any more than\r\nthe old private school, which could be done only by endless means in\r\nendowment. I do not believe we should try, because it can be done better\r\nand cheaper in another way; because the library has the books on its\r\nshelves. The statistics this morning showed that the bookseller is dying\r\nout. I believe it to be entirely impossible to rehabilitate that\r\nprofession. If in the library it becomes a recognized principle that\r\nthe library is supported at public expense for the purpose of lending\r\nbooks. I am confident that the public will demand it to be done in that\r\nway. I am confident of another thing. You have only to consult your\r\ncatalogs to see the remarkable development of the last decade in\r\npublishing which is done by endowed universities and colleges and of\r\nlearned societies. See the great body of technical journals that have\r\nbeen turned over the university presses. Every university that pretends\r\nto accomplish much now has a press, and is developing it with great\r\nrapidity. It was said this morning that the publisher hinged on the\r\ncash; that the bookseller hinged on that. Ladies and gentlemen, the cash\r\nprofit is not a proper scale in which to weigh the questions in which we\r\nare interested. When you take questions of education, or religion, or\r\nphilanthropy, and put them on a question of cash profit, you are in an\r\nabsolutely false attitude. I do not mean by that that we must not regard\r\nbusiness conditions. We must know how to pay for our coal and our rent,\r\nbut not a dividend in dollars and cents. And the moment my antagonist\r\nsays that this question is to be measured by a cash dividend, I say he\r\nis ruled out of court in any body of librarians who are giving their\r\nlives and their work at salaries not at all commensurate, but who make\r\ndividends on a higher plane. There is no occasion for an attitude of\r\nhostility; nor, I take it, for me to take issue on this new proposition\r\nin regard to prices to libraries. There is not a librarian in this room\r\nwho has all the money he wants. If prices rise ten per cent., it will\r\ndiminish the number of books he can buy. I followed the argument this\r\nmorning. If it is correct, there is only one thing we can do. We, as\r\nlibrarians, are cutting into the revenues of these men, and we ought not\r\nonly not to ask a discount but librarians ought to pay twenty-five per\r\ncent. in addition, because we are cutting into their revenues. We ought\r\nto appoint a committee, which without a bit of the spirit of antagonism,\r\nshould meet the publishers and booksellers and point out all over the\r\nUnited States large consumers who buy for cash. I think it is a\r\npractical mistake to try to force up the price, and that we are bound as\r\ncustodians of this money that is put in our hands, firmly and\r\ncourteously, but, I am sure, with the most friendly relations on both\r\nsides, to see that the prices of our books shall not be cut down.\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, in summing up, after an observation of thirty years,\r\nthat I am confident that the library of this century is going to assume\r\nthose educational functions, and that among the most prominent of these\r\nis the putting into the hands of the people who wish to make their lives\r\nwealthier in arts or trades the books of power and of inspiration. The\r\npublic library cannot afford not to put into their hands at a minimum\r\nprice the books they want to read. And, logically we shall be forced in\r\nthat direction. You will find that this tendency is growing all the\r\nwhile, and we will have to put the library squarely alongside the high\r\nschool. Indeed the library in its development is following exactly the\r\nline of development of the tax-supported high school and for that same\r\nreason, that in the high school we now offer instruction free, the\r\nlibrary will offer books for sale without profit--there should be no\r\nprofit in the library--and will lend books freely, and will with regret\r\nkill the local book store and supplant it by something that is worth a\r\ngreat deal more.\r\n\r\nW. I. FLETCHER: I have been so long on the Publishing Board with Mr.\r\nDewey that I have got thoroughly in the habit, when he gets through, of\r\nsaying something on the other side. It seems to me that a few words\r\nmight be said to clarify this subject. It is undoubtedly true, as Mr.\r\nDewey has said, that a book store that is worth anything could not be\r\nestablished in every place in the country. There ought to be something\r\nof the sort, even if it is a public library. The book stores exist only\r\nin places where it is commercially possible, and that number of places\r\nis very limited. Now I suppose that if we could ascertain the\r\ncommunities where it is not commercially possible for a book store to be\r\ncarried on, we should none of us have any objection--it seems to me most\r\nof us would favor the idea--that the public library should, to some\r\nextent, take the place of the book store in supplying books to the\r\nwould-be owners in such a community. That leaves the question confined\r\nto those places where a book store is commercially impossible, probably\r\nto those places where book stores have been, even with difficulty,\r\nmaintained under past conditions. I should be willing, for my own part,\r\nto do all I could in securing the establishment of a good book store\r\nwhere there is not one, where it is commercially possible to maintain\r\none. Where it is not, it would be a good thing to let the library sell\r\nthe books. I am greatly impressed with the argument as to the advantages\r\nof a book store in a community where it can be maintained. So it seems\r\nto me that there is not very much difference of opinion among us, after\r\nall, as I dare say those who spoke this morning would not object\r\nseriously to the distribution of books for sale through the libraries,\r\nwhere there is no hope of having a local book store. As to the amount of\r\ndiscount under this new arrangement, I am entirely in accord with Mr.\r\nDewey in wishing that the Association might present whatever are the\r\nviews of the Association. On the subject of the amount of discount that\r\nwe ought to have, I should hardly feel that the booksellers were\r\ntreating us right in this country if they should follow the custom of\r\nthe German publishing trade and refuse any discount at all; and it is a\r\nquestion whether the ten per cent. which they propose to allow under\r\nthis new system is enough. I have advised our library committee to\r\nexpress a hearty readiness to accede to the proposed arrangement, to\r\ntake the ten per cent. discount, and we have given our adhesion to it.\r\nPerhaps that was somewhat hasty, before the librarians in general had an\r\nopportunity to act; but I do not believe anything very different from\r\nthat will be the attitude of the librarians at large. We might in time,\r\nfor example, make it fifteen per cent., but I am sure that could not be\r\ndone at present. I am heartily in sympathy with the movement that will\r\nmake it possible to have a good book store, which I believe every\r\nlibrarian would like to have in his place.\r\n\r\nW. M. PALMER: I wish to say just this: Of course in the lack of time\r\nthat was accorded me, it is difficult to say all that can be said on the\r\nsubject, and explain the by-paths, and so forth; but, as I intimated at\r\nthe introduction of my paper, I simply stated what I said as facts, and\r\nwhile we wish a great many things to be different, we realize that they\r\ncannot be reached in a certain direction all at once. In order to bring\r\nthe bookselling business to a basis which will enable the bookseller to\r\nlive, some reform had to take place. The publishers have seen fit to\r\ninstitute the reform which has been outlined to-day. When I spoke this\r\nmorning, for instance, of the fact that some librarians ordered books\r\nfor friends and others at the discounts which the library and they\r\nthemselves received from the booksellers, I did not wish to impute any\r\nwrong motive to the librarian in doing that. It is a matter within the\r\nknowledge of the booksellers, and the booksellers wink at it. I do not\r\nthink there was any element of dishonesty in it, because the bookseller\r\nwho sold the book to the librarian knew it was again to be sold to some\r\nfriend of the librarian.\r\n\r\nR. R. BOWKER: In offering a resolution, I wish to say just a word or\r\ntwo. I had not expected Mr. Dewey to make an argument in favor of the\r\npublic library, for certainly there would be no disagreement on that\r\npoint in this room. Where he went further and suggested that the\r\nsalaried librarian should become the commercial bookseller, I think and\r\nI hope that there are few to follow him to that length of argument. As\r\nto the Booklovers' Library, of course that is not at all in analogy with\r\nthe public library, and I want to take this opportunity to call\r\nattention to what seems to me an admirable use of the Booklovers'\r\nLibrary scheme, so long as it can hold out. Mr. Carr has told me that he\r\nhas looked upon the Booklovers' Library as a very useful overflow or\r\nsafety-valve for the public library. When thirty-five people come at\r\nonce and want \"Quincy Adams Sawyer,\" and a librarian sees that the two\r\ncopies that could be put on the shelves would not meet the demand, he\r\nwould say to himself \"I cannot rightly spend the money for thirty-five\r\ncopies,\" and therefore he would say to the thirty-three, \"You can go to\r\nthe Booklovers' Library and get these new books just when you want\r\nthem.\" So this library may be a relief to the librarian who is\r\nconscientious in the spending of his money.\r\n\r\nThe resolution which I now ask to move is that the Council be requested\r\nto appoint a committee on relations with the book trade, to which this\r\nquestion shall be referred.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was carried.\r\n\r\nThe general session was then adjourned, and there followed a Round Table\r\nmeeting on\r\n\r\n                 THE WORK OF STATE LIBRARY COMMISSIONS.\r\n\r\n                            (_See_ p. 171.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _SEVENTH SESSION._\r\n\r\n          (FOUNTAIN SPRING HOUSE, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JULY 10.)\r\n\r\nPresident CARR called the meeting to order at 10 a.m., and after local\r\nannouncements by the secretary called upon the tellers to report upon\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ELECTION OF OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThe result of the balloting was announced by the secretary as follows:\r\n  _President_: John S. Billings, 103.\r\n  _1st Vice-president_: J. K. Hosmer, 103.\r\n  _2d Vice-president_: Electra C. Doren, 104.\r\n  _Secretary_: Frederick W. Faxon, 104.\r\n  _Treasurer_: Gardner M. Jones, 105.\r\n  _Recorder_: Helen E. Haines, 105.\r\n  _Trustee of Endowment Fund_: Charles C. Soule, 81.\r\n  _A. L. A. Council_: M. E. Ahern, 101; E. H. Anderson, 104; Johnson\r\nBrigham, 104; John Thomson, 104; H. M. Utley, 105.\r\n\r\nThe president then announced that the Association would be glad to hear\r\nfrom Mr. PUTNAM, as chairman of the\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nMr. PUTNAM: The Committee on Resolutions has suffered the usual\r\nembarrassments of committees on resolutions. It has been compelled to\r\nabstain from expressions which might seem hyperbole, and from\r\ndesignating by name many services that prefer to remain anonymous.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom of certain associations to make acknowledgment to those\r\nspeakers on the program not members of the conference. That is not\r\ncustomary with the A. L. A. Had it been, I should have had a special\r\npleasure in proposing an acknowledgment to Professor Ely for his\r\npresence and paper yesterday. It is no slight compliment to the\r\nAssociation when a thinker and writer so eminent as Dr. Ely is willing\r\nto lay his views before it. It is, in a sense, a greater compliment when\r\nhis views prove unfavorable to some undertaking which the Association is\r\ninclined to approve. It implies that our action may be important, and\r\ntherefore our judgment worth convincing. Could the Association convince\r\nDr. Ely, great advantage indeed might result. For should a selected list\r\nof books in economics be undertaken with helpful notes--I will not say\r\n\"evaluations,\" or \"appraisals\"--but helpful _notes_, Dr. Ely's aid would\r\nbe one of those first sought.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the American Library Association, in concluding a\r\nmeeting that has been one of the most largely attended and most\r\nsuccessful in its history, desires to express its hearty obligation to\r\nthe various committees and individuals who have made considerate\r\narrangements for its comfort, and in many an agreeable incident acted as\r\nits hosts. In particular:\r\n\r\nTo the Wisconsin Free Library Commission for its efficient general\r\narrangements for the conference;\r\n\r\nTo the Citizens' Executive Committee and Women's Clubs of Waukesha, for\r\nthe attractive drives about the city, for the pleasant evening\r\nreception at the Fountain Spring House, and for various attentive\r\ncourtesies;\r\n\r\nTo the members of the Methodist Church of Waukesha, for the use of the\r\nchurch for the public meeting on July 4;\r\n\r\nTo Senator A. M. Jones, for the opportunity to visit Bethesda Park and\r\nenjoy there the concert given by him complimentary to the Association;\r\n\r\nTo the trustees, librarian and staff of the Milwaukee Public Library,\r\nfor the opportunity to inspect the library under most favorable\r\nconditions, and to the junior members of the staff for the appetizing\r\nrefreshments served in connection with the visit;\r\n\r\nTo the resident librarians of Madison, the Forty Thousand Club, and\r\nvarious citizens, for the drive through the city and delightful\r\nparkways of Madison; to the resident women librarians, the Madison\r\nWoman's Club, and the Emily Bishop League, for the luncheon which was\r\nprovided so substantially for the great company of visitors; and in\r\ngeneral to the chairmen and members of the several local committees\r\nrepresenting the state, the city, and various institutions and\r\norganizations, who contrived so excellently for the accommodation and\r\nenjoyment of the Association in its visit to Madison.\r\n\r\nThe Association deems itself fortunate indeed in having held its\r\nmeeting within reach of two achievements in library architecture so\r\nnotable as the library buildings at Madison and at Milwaukee.\r\n\r\nThe Association would add its appreciation of the endeavor of the\r\nmanagement of the Fountain Spring House to convenience in every way the\r\nbusiness of the conference; and its obligation for the special\r\nprovision made by the management for its entertainment on two evenings\r\nof the conference.\r\n\r\nThe Association is aware that in addition to the hospitalities which it\r\nhas enjoyed, many have been proffered which could not be accepted\r\nwithout injustice to the affairs of business which were the proper\r\npurpose of the conference. It desires to record its acknowledgment of\r\nthese also, and of the kindly consideration of the hosts who in\r\ndeference to this purpose have been willing to forego inclinations\r\nwhich it would have been a generous pleasure to themselves to have\r\ncarried into effect.\r\n\r\n                                HERBERT PUTNAM,      } _Committee_\r\n                                J.

The chair can only say to you that he\r\nappreciates more than he can express, even had he more vigorous and full\r\ncommand of language than he possesses, all that has been done by\r\nmembers, officers, chairmen of committees, one and all, to aid in the\r\ntransaction of business and in the success of this conference. The chair\r\nalso wishes to congratulate you upon what you yourselves have done to\r\nmake this meeting a happy one, and trusts that it may long be remembered\r\nby us all, and that we may all long continue to work together in the A.\r\nL.

I. FLETCHER being in the chair.\r\n\r\nThe program was opened by an address by the chairman on\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SOME 20TH CENTURY LIBRARY PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\nThe 20th century is undoubtedly something of a fad already with public\r\nspeakers. I should hesitate to speak of 20th century problems in library\r\nwork were there not a special justification for noting chronologic\r\nepochs in connection with the modern library movement. It was almost\r\nprecisely at the middle of the century that this movement took its rise\r\nin the passage of the first public library laws in England and in New\r\nEngland. And again it was at the very middle of the last half century,\r\nin the year 1876, that this Association was formed and the _Library\r\nJournal_ started. (I may be excused for merely alluding to the fact,\r\nparenthetically, that Melvil Dewey graduated from Amherst College in\r\n1874.) And now at the very beginning of the new century the library\r\nmovement receives an enormous impetus from the benefactions of Andrew\r\nCarnegie, not only in themselves multiplying and increasing libraries,\r\nbut serving as a great stimulus to towns and cities and states as well\r\nas to individuals, so that his indirect contribution to the cause of\r\nlibraries will probably far outweigh his direct gifts, princely as they\r\nare.\r\n\r\nThe library problems of the 20th century sum themselves up in one, the\r\nproblem of expansion, and we may perhaps best regard them from the point\r\nof view of the obstacles to expansion, these obstacles constituting the\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must notice our library buildings, and admit that many of\r\nthem, and most of the ideas heretofore cherished about the building of\r\nlibraries, present such an obstacle. When we note that since the plans\r\nwere drawn on which nearly all of our most recent large library\r\nbuildings have been erected, three new ideas in library administration\r\nhave come into general acceptance which must powerfully affect library\r\nconstruction, we can but feel that great foresight and wisdom are needed\r\nto erect libraries that shall not very soon be obstacles to proper and\r\nnecessary expansion. These three new ideas are, first, access of readers\r\nto the bookshelves; second, children's rooms, and third, the\r\ndistribution of books through schools, branches, delivery stations, home\r\nlibraries, and inter-library loans, this third new idea involving\r\nprovision for business offices, packing rooms, etc., unthought of\r\nformerly. To meet not simply these new ideas, but others with which the\r\nnew century is pregnant, care must be taken that great sums of money,\r\nleaving the securing of more for a long time hopeless, are not expended\r\non structures in which instead of provision for expansion we seem to\r\nhave provision against it.\r\n\r\nAnother obstacle to expansion is found in elaborate systems of\r\nshelf-marks connected with systematic schemes of classification,\r\nrepresenting carefully arranged subordination and co-ordination of the\r\nparts. For two things are certain: first, accepted classifications of\r\nbooks rapidly become obsolete, and second, no library will long be\r\ncontent with an out-of-date arrangement. Especially will my successor,\r\nor yours, be sure to feel the necessity of signalizing his accession to\r\noffice by introducing what is in his day the latest classification. And\r\nin this he will be right. Now, if we have a fair sense of our duty to\r\nour successor, which is merely an extension forward of our duty to the\r\nlibrary itself, we shall be unwilling to tie the library by an intricate\r\nnotation to a present system of classification. I think we must take\r\nmore pains than is done by either the Decimal or Expansive schemes to\r\nprovide a somewhat elastic notation. I regard the classification of the\r\nUniversity of California Library as the best (available in print) for\r\nlibraries of our class, because it employs designations which indicate\r\nmere sequence of classes. A little thought will, I am sure, show you how\r\nthis is true. At any rate, a little experience in attempting more or\r\nless reclassification with, for example, the Decimal classification,\r\nwill prepare you to believe that a less highly involved and articulated\r\nmethod of designation would be in the interest of reasonable expansion,\r\nand save such expansion from the odium of upsetting the classification.\r\nThrough the logic of events forcing those considerations to the front\r\nmore and more, I anticipate that the larger and rapidly growing\r\nlibraries will increasingly shun all such systems as the \"D. C.\" and the\r\n\"E. C.,\" of which the paradox is certainly true, that the better they\r\nare made the worse they become. The scheme of numbering classes recently\r\nadopted by Princeton University Library points in this direction, while\r\nthe reclassification of Harvard University Library, which has been\r\nslowly carried forward during the last 20 years or more, represents a\r\ncomplete departure from the idea of any correlation between classes, as\r\nindicated in the notation, the order of minor divisions being a\r\nnumerical sequence easily changed or modified, while each main class\r\nbears a mark suggesting no relation to another. For example, the\r\nmilitary and naval sciences have lately been reclassified and brought\r\nunder the designation War, which may be called (to represent a certain\r\nharmony with other designations) W-a-r. The location of any main class\r\nin the library is subject to change at any time, and is known to the\r\nattendants by a chart, which may be somewhat altered to-day, and\r\nreplaced by a new one with large differences to-morrow or next year. Not\r\nthat such changes would be made except for real occasion, but under this\r\nsystem, when they are necessary they are not deferred or regarded as\r\nhopeless as they must be under any highly organized system.\r\n\r\nAnother obstacle to expansion closely related to elaborate methods of\r\nnotation is found in the common practice of inserting the call-numbers\r\nin catalogs of all kinds, written or printed. When the Boston Public\r\nLibrary was moved into the new building it was naturally supposed that\r\nit would be completely rearranged to suit its ampler and entirely\r\ndifferent shelf-room, particularly as much fault had already been found\r\nwith its existing classification, which seemed quite outgrown. But when\r\nit is observed how the library was tied to its old numbering by an\r\nendless variety of catalogs, printed as well as written, it ceases to\r\nseem strange that it was thought best to transfer the old arrangement to\r\nthe new building, with all its infelicities heightened by its new\r\nlocation and surroundings. And in this respect that library should serve\r\nas a warning to others to avoid, by any available means, such an\r\nentanglement. If it be asked what means of avoiding it are available, I\r\nwould say that I am inclined to think that if I were starting with a new\r\nlibrary I would try the experiment of putting no shelf-numbers or\r\ncall-marks in any catalog, but rather have a key by which they could be\r\nfound by means of the accession numbers which alone would be given in\r\nthe author-catalog.\r\n\r\nI can only refer hastily to one feature of library expansion which is\r\ncoming in with the new century, and which has to do with the catalog. I\r\nmean the introduction of printed cards, and would say that I look to see\r\nthese work a revolution in library methods. If we can procure at low\r\ncost an indefinite number of these cards for each book we shall come to\r\nuse them in many ways, as, for example, the accession record, the shelf\r\nlist, bulletins and special lists, and charging cards. For the latter\r\npurpose they would have the advantage of absolutely identifying the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nI am sure I have said enough to set you thinking, and I hope when time\r\nis given for discussion you will freely express your thoughts.\r\n\r\nJ. T. GEROULD read a paper on\r\n\r\n                        DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 46.)\r\n\r\nW. P. CUTTER read a letter from R. C. DAVIS on the\r\n\r\n\r\n     RECLASSIFICATION OF THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.\r\n\r\nI am conscious that this report of our adoption of the Decimal\r\nclassification is, as far as I am concerned, premature. I look upon the\r\nwork in its present state as just from the broad-axe or the saw-mill.\r\nThere is planing to be done and sand-papering. Except to discuss now and\r\nthen some fundamental principle in classification, I have had little to\r\ndo with the work. Other duties, which I must necessarily perform, have\r\noccupied every hour of my time. I am hoping that now the rough part of\r\nthis work is off our hands, I can make a readjustment of the work in\r\ngeneral that will give me time next year to participate in the finishing\r\nprocess. The history of the matter is very brief. Our old fixed location\r\nhad become impossible, and a point was reached where it was necessary to\r\nbegin at once with whatever movable method we might adopt. I had been at\r\nwork for some time on a substitution of relative markings for fixed\r\nones, which would, without any change of classification, set our books\r\nfree. This was interrupted by sickness at the critical time, and it was\r\ndetermined to adopt the Decimal classification as the most generally\r\nused and the most susceptible of modification. Also, my assistants, on\r\nwhom the work would fall, were familiar with this method, and had\r\nexperience in working it. The changes that had been made were made\r\nlargely in deference to the desires of heads of departments. It was not\r\nalways easy to act on these suggestions inasmuch as a general adoption\r\nof them would be fatal to uniformity. In consequence some of the changes\r\nare in the nature of a compromise, and are tentative. The change now so\r\nnearly accomplished has been made economically and, considering all\r\nthings, expeditiously. The credit of this is due to my assistants. They\r\nhave been untiring in their industry and their management of the\r\ndifferences of opinion that they have encountered has been wise and\r\ntactful. Mr. Jordan, my cataloger, has made a brief catalog of the\r\nchanges, which I enclose. You can make such use of this matter as you\r\nmay desire at your meeting, but I would prefer that nothing go upon\r\nrecord. By next year we shall have the matter better digested, and I\r\nhope some of us may be present at the meeting to discuss it. It is a\r\nsubject which has a perennial interest.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of W. W. BISHOP, J. I. WYER read Mr. BISHOP'S paper on\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR AN ANNUAL LIST OF AMERICAN THESES FOR THE PH.D. DEGREE.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 50.)\r\n\r\nAfter the reading of Mr. Bishop's paper there was some discussion in\r\nregard to the great desirability of having published each year a list of\r\nthe dissertations presented to American universities. On the motion of\r\nDr. B. C. Steiner it was resolved that a committee of three be appointed\r\nby the chair to consider the question of the section taking steps to\r\nsecure such an annual list. Mr. Fletcher appointed Dr. B. C. Steiner, W.\r\nM. Smith and C. W. Andrews to form the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. A. G. S. JOSEPHSON wished that a complete bibliography of university\r\ntheses could be made.\r\n\r\nThe chairman announced that the election of officers for the next year\r\nwould take place, and called for nominations.\r\n\r\nMr. Josephson nominated Mr. A. S. Root for chairman. Mr. Root was\r\nelected. Dr. Canfield nominated for secretary Mr. W. M. Smith, and Mr.\r\nSmith nominated Miss Emma A. Hawley. Mr. Smith was elected.\r\n\r\nAfter the election there followed a general discussion of the topics\r\npresented during the afternoon, those receiving special notice being\r\nclassification, notation, the use of call numbers, department libraries\r\nand university theses.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion Mr. FLETCHER said:\r\n\r\nMy thought about dispensing with shelf-marks in the card and other\r\ncatalogs (not really my thought, for I had it from one of our leading\r\nlibrarians, who has not, however, put it in practice himself) is that\r\nthe great difficulties connected with the changing of shelf-marks in\r\ncatalogs when books are reclassified may be avoided by placing on the\r\ncard only the accession number (in case of a set the accession number of\r\nthe first volume), and then maintaining a key, consisting of a book\r\nclosely ruled in double columns, where for each book in the library the\r\nshelf-mark is written in pencil against the accession number and changed\r\nwhenever the book is renumbered. Such a scheme could not be\r\nsatisfactorily applied in a library where the looking-up of the\r\nshelf-mark is involved in the calling for books in most cases. I am\r\nprepared to favor it only where (as is now the case in our own library)\r\na majority of the calls for books are made orally and answered by the\r\nattendant without reference to shelf-mark. In our case these calls\r\namount to seven-eighths of all the calls, and in addition to this it\r\nshould be said that at least one-half the books drawn under our\r\nopen-shelf system are drawn without any \"call\" at all, so that we may\r\nsay, that if we had the \"key\" system it would come into play for perhaps\r\none-sixteenth of the books drawn. In libraries of moderate circulation\r\nlike our college and university libraries, and (for all but certain\r\nclasses which are most used) even in the large public libraries, it\r\nseems to me that the key plan may work well. Of course the key if\r\nsubjected to constant use would be difficult and expensive to maintain,\r\nowing to wear and tear. We should not fail to observe that three\r\nseparate and distinct features of modern library progress are each and\r\nall working against the necessity, _i.e._, tending to minimize the\r\nnecessity, of shelf-marks in the catalog.\r\n\r\nThese are, first, the open-shelf system; second, minute classification\r\nand alphabetical arrangement in classes, and third, book-card charging\r\nsystems. Without enlarging upon these points, I would like to suggest\r\nthem to you as worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. HODGES described briefly the classification of the scientific books\r\nat Harvard. First, the serial publications of the broad learned\r\nsocieties, the societies taking cognizance of all branches of learning,\r\nare brought together arranged alphabetically by country and city.\r\nSecondly, the general scientific serials and the special scientific\r\nserials, however published, are arranged in a group; the general coming\r\nfirst, the others following according to subject, astronomy,\r\nmathematics, physics, chemistry, natural history, zoology, botany, etc.\r\nWhen suggesting the separation of the serials in pure science from the\r\nhandbooks at the very outset of his work at Harvard, Mr. Hodges urged\r\nthat the serials constitute a record literature to which the\r\ninvestigator must refer when carrying on original work, while the\r\nhandbooks are used by the pedagog when preparing for his classwork. The\r\ngeneral designation for the learned society group is L. Soc.; for the\r\nscientific serials, Sci. The handbooks on physics are in a group\r\ndesignated Phys.; the general treatises by Phys. 357-360. A treatise\r\npublished in 1892 is marked Phys. 358-92; another of the same year, by\r\nPhys. 358.92.3.\r\n\r\nMr. ROOT said: It may possibly have interest in this connection to note\r\nthat the catalog of the University of Göttingen, which was established\r\nabout 1750, has the feature which has been mentioned here as\r\ncharacteristic of the Harvard system. The books are grouped in large\r\nclasses with an abbreviated heading, with minute sub-classification.\r\nJust when this system was introduced I do not know, but I suppose it to\r\nhave been in use a hundred years or so, which I judge to be a longer\r\nlife than Mr. Fletcher is willing to allow to the D. C.\r\n\r\nInteresting remarks were made by several others, notably Mr. Andrews,\r\nDr. Steiner and Dr. Canfield. It is to be regretted that the revision of\r\ntheir remarks has not been received in time for publication.\r\n                                             OLIVE JONES, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CATALOG SECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Catalog Section of the American Library Association held two\r\nmeetings in connection with the Waukesha conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _FIRST SESSION._\r\n\r\nThe first session was held in one of the parlors of the Fountain Spring\r\nHouse, on the afternoon of Tuesday, July 9. The chairman, ANDERSON H.\r\nHOPKINS, called the meeting to order.\r\n\r\nIt was _Voted_, That the section waive the formality of registration of\r\nmembers preliminary to voting.\r\n\r\nIt was _Voted_, That the chairman appoint a nominating committee of\r\nthree, to report at the close of the session. This committee was\r\nappointed as follows: Miss Sula Wagner, Mr. Jones, Mr. Roden.\r\n\r\nA. H. HOPKINS: When the round table session on this subject was held\r\nlast year its object was, of course, to find out whether there was a\r\ndemand for a section of this kind. We found it out pretty soon. Now we\r\nhave the section. Then came the question, when I was asked to assume the\r\nchairmanship for one more year, of how it might best be occupied. It\r\nseemed to me for a time that perhaps the best plan would be to go to the\r\nopposite extreme--from having been informal last year--and have set\r\npapers, especially as the Association had decided not to take\r\nstenographic reports of the meetings. However, a change came about in my\r\nviews when the interstate meeting was called at Atlantic City last\r\nMarch. A meeting was held there of the Publishing Board's committee on\r\nrules for a printed card catalog. The members of that committee were at\r\nthat time all of the opinion that no better plan could be followed for\r\nthis year's meeting of the Catalog Section than to have another\r\ndiscussion similar to that of last year, but confining the talk chiefly\r\nto knotty points which they met in the course of their work. That has\r\nbeen done; but there have been added a few questions which have come to\r\nyour chairman in the course of the year from persons interested in the\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThe Publishing Board, in taking up the task of producing printed cards,\r\nfound that widely divergent practices must be shaped so that they would\r\nwork together. To this end they appointed a committee of seven and set\r\nthem the task of producing harmony among the jarring elements of\r\npractice in all the libraries of this country, barring none. The head of\r\nthe catalog department of the Library of Congress was made chairman of\r\nthis committee; and, as you know, this great library and its chief, to\r\nwhom we all turn so gladly, are lending their cordial support to the\r\nproject, and realization now seems near at hand.\r\n\r\nNow what do we want? We want an arrangement whereby any one may be able\r\nat a reasonable cost to get accurately made and well printed cards for\r\nany book at any time. This and nothing else will do. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe members of the Committee on Rules thought this session could not be\r\nbetter occupied, as I said before, than in a discussion of certain\r\npoints, met by them in their attempts to produce a workable scheme which\r\nwould meet adequate support, it having at that time become evident that\r\nthe enthusiasm so manifest at Montreal had largely evaporated; probably\r\nbecause it had not been made clear that the proposed plan was really a\r\nworkable scheme. Some of these points the chairman of the committee and\r\nmyself have selected and graded roughly into three classes, and I will\r\nlay some of these before you.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief troubles is going to lie between the _32 and 33 size\r\ncards_. Let us hear from you on this subject, if you have anything you\r\nwish to say about it.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: Perhaps those present may be interested to know something\r\nabout the 32 and 33 card from the point of view of the Publishing Board.\r\nThe Publishing Board has been supplying the 32 or 33 size card as\r\nrequired by subscribers for cards for current books. I cannot speak\r\nauthoritatively, but I think the board is nearly prepared to say that in\r\nfuture, if these cards are prepared at the Library of Congress and\r\ndistributed from there, it will be found very much the wisest plan from\r\nthe beginning to use only the 33 size. It has not been declared\r\nimpossible at the Library of Congress to print the cards in such shape\r\nthat enough could be cut off to make the card a 32 card; neither has it\r\nbeen decided by the board that it is not worth while to try earnestly to\r\nbring that about; but the present impression, I think, is that the 32\r\nsize will have to be left aside in the co-operative work. If there is a\r\nstrong sentiment here to retain the 32 size card, let us hear of it now.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Couldn't Mr. Hanson, of the Library of Congress, give us a\r\nreport on the letters they received there in regard to the size of cards\r\nused? And let me emphasize this thought, that in coming to a uniform\r\nsystem we must approach as near uniformity as possible. It is impossible\r\nto meet all the variances of cards in the several libraries, but we must\r\nlook towards drawing all the using libraries into as close uniformity as\r\npossible. And I think the prevailing practice is shown best by the\r\nstatistics which I believe Mr. Hanson has with him.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: The statistics Mr. Bowker refers to I have not with me. As I\r\nrecall the figures there are something like 19 out of 100 that use the\r\n32 card.\r\n\r\nMr. ANDREWS: I have Mr. Putnam's figures. I was astonished to find the\r\npercentage that were using the larger card. Out of 185 reporting 138\r\nused the 33 card, 38 used the 32 card and only 19 (true those 19 are the\r\nolder, better established and larger libraries) used odd sizes.\r\n\r\nI will take occasion to ask Mr. Hanson to answer another question on\r\nthis point. I had an interview in his company last winter with the\r\nrepresentative of the Harvard Library, which uses the smaller card. We\r\nthen came to a satisfactory compromise, and I am surprised to hear Mr.\r\nFletcher say it is all in the air. It was understood that the Library of\r\nCongress wanted for its subject headings, and we wanted for our subject\r\nheadings, a sufficient amount of space, and that they were not willing\r\nto print below the punched hole. That leaves exactly the width of the 32\r\ncard in the center of the 33. And the proposition agreed to by all of us\r\nin this conversation was to print the 33 card with the broad margin\r\nabove and never go below the hole, so any library that wanted to could\r\nbuy the cards and cut them down on both top and bottom and have a 32\r\ncard. It was understood to be satisfactory to all the 32 users that I\r\nconsulted, including Harvard, the largest, I believe, of them all. It is\r\nthat point that I would like to ask Mr. Hanson to report on--whether he\r\nnow feels that he must go higher or lower than the lines we then\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I don't feel it absolutely necessary; in fact we are\r\nfollowing out the measurements laid down by the Publishing Board now. I\r\nhave in my hand two cards--the title runs over on the second card at\r\nconsiderable waste of space, as you can see. But the printers have their\r\nmeasurements which provide for cutting away the space above and below to\r\naccommodate the 32 card. But I believe it is going to be objectionable,\r\nin the end, when it runs over on the second card. That is the only\r\nobjection I can see.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I should like to have Mr. Andrews state whether this card,\r\nif it has to be cut down at the top as well as at the bottom, will allow\r\nroom for headings?\r\n\r\nMiss BROWNE: Instead of having to print a second card I don't see why we\r\ncan't print the 33 card; then if the 32 card libraries want it in their\r\ncatalog why can't they transcribe the extra line or so by hand on a\r\nsecond card and cut off the bottom. In nine cases out of 10 it would not\r\nmake any difference. In one case in 10 where they would have to\r\ntranscribe on the second card, is there any reason why it could not be\r\ndone?\r\n\r\nMiss DOREN: I am not a user of the 32 card. The only objection I see, if\r\nI were to use it, would be that perhaps I should have to pay a little\r\nmore for my card than those that use the 33 card, and it would make the\r\ncatalog a little more bulky.\r\n\r\nMr. ANDREWS: Talking with Miss Crawford it was evident that the Dayton\r\nlibrary wanted a broad margin for analyticals and headings above the\r\nprint in the 33 card. That is exactly what we want. We don't want it as\r\nmuch as they do, but I want to emphasize the necessity for a broad top\r\nmargin. That is the point which makes it desirable for 33 people as well\r\nas for 32.\r\n\r\nMiss DOREN: I did not understand the question as referring to analytical\r\nheadings. We do want those above all things, and if we are to use the\r\ncard at all we need the broad margin at the top. Our use of the card\r\ndepends upon having a broad margin at the top.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: I should like a show of hands on this point. Are those\r\npresent, whether 33-card or 32-card people, of the opinion that, after\r\ndropping the heading so as to leave ample room at the top to permit the\r\n32 card to be cut out from the 33 card, as stated by Mr. Andrews, it\r\nwould be better to run the type down farther than the hole, if\r\nnecessary, on either side, and then cut and recopy for the 32 size, or\r\nto make a double card both for the 33 and 32 size?\r\n\r\nI suggest that the show of hands be first from those who prefer to have\r\none card furnished for a title when possible, and then to transcribe the\r\nlower part, if necessary, for the 32 card; and then from those who\r\nprefer to have a second card wherever it is not possible to put the\r\nmaterial on the space of the 32 card as printed on the 33 size. Is that\r\nclear?\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: I believe so. It includes, however, both the users of the 32\r\nand 33 cards, and instead of a show of hands let us have a rising vote,\r\nand give time to count them.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Those who are in favor of printing below the 32-card limit\r\non the 33 card, rather than furnishing two cards to a title, please\r\nrise. 56 persons rose.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Those who are in favor of confining the print to the 32 size\r\nand having a second overflow card printed for the same title, please\r\nrise. 17 persons rose.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I should like to call for a rising vote to learn how many\r\nwould like to urge that arrangements be made by which 32-size cards can\r\nbe furnished. Three persons rose.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I cannot think of any library printing cards that would care\r\nto print any lower than the round hole. On the other hand, the library\r\nmust have three-quarters of an inch at the top of the card for headings.\r\nWill that leave sufficient space for taking away from top and bottom?\r\n\r\nMr. ANDREWS: They accepted it by that first vote.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: Then they must punch the hole in the margin.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Or lose the part they punch out. If you will excuse me, I will\r\nput forth a little argument of my own.\r\n\r\nApropos of another report I had to make some time ago, I had heard that\r\nthe greatest library in this country, certainly in some respects, was\r\nchanging its plan to accommodate itself to the 33 card. I wrote to Mr.\r\nWhitney, of the Boston Public Library, which as you know uses a card\r\nlarger than the 33, and it is a fact that with their immense catalog\r\nrunning for so many years, and with so large a number of cards which\r\nthey cannot now cut down to the 33 size, they have found it advisable so\r\nto modify their plan for titles henceforth that the cards may be cut\r\ndown to the 33 size on reprinting the old titles. Here is the letter,\r\nthe report from his cataloger. [Mr. Hopkins here read the letter.] If\r\nthey do not think it likely that ultimately they will use the 33 card\r\nwhy should they take all that trouble? Now, the problem they had to deal\r\nwith was 10 times more difficult than that which the users of the 32\r\ncards have to deal with. All you have to do with a 32 card to make it a\r\n33 size is to paste it on something big enough and provide space to hold\r\nit. With such evidence as this before us why should we fret ourselves to\r\nprovide a 32 card when the change to the 33 can be so easily and so\r\ncheaply made?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: May I add a word which Dr. Billings said to me? He said that\r\nhe preferred a printed catalog card to a written catalog card any time,\r\nwithout reference to any question of uniformity. So he was actually\r\nreplacing his written catalog cards with the Library of Congress cards\r\nor Library Bureau cards. I think that there is growing in the great\r\nlibraries a desire for some general method which will supply printed\r\ncatalog cards.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Is there any further discussion on this topic? If not we will\r\npass to the next.\r\n\r\n_Notes and Contents._ I read from the official report made by the\r\nCommittee on Rules to the Publishing Board: \"The position of the\r\ncollation and series note to be on a separate line immediately after the\r\ndate and preceding other notes.\" Now we cannot take up the whole\r\nquestion of notes, nor the question of the minority report which Mr.\r\nHopkins was asked to submit; but the question I would submit to you is\r\nthis: Is not the contents note really, logically, sensibly, a part of\r\nthe title? Is it not actually, in almost nine cases out of ten, more\r\nimportant than the title itself? If it were not, would it not be\r\nnonsense to print the contents note? If it is so, why separate the\r\ncontents note from the title by other relatively unimportant matter? Has\r\nanybody anything to say?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: It seems to me it would be well to say here, collation is\r\nused for pagination, illustrations, maps, plates, etc., and size. That\r\nis the imprint, as we have for convenience's sake called collation; and\r\nthe idea is that this information is to be paragraphed, on a separate\r\nline, so as to set out the date and make the date end the line in twelve\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nMr. BISCOE: I want to say a word on the other side. It seems to me that\r\nit would be unfortunate to put the collation after the contents,\r\nparticularly where the contents are long. It would throw the collation\r\non the second card. To find out whether you had more than one volume you\r\nwould have to turn to another card. If you are looking for duplicates\r\nyou want to see at once not only the author of the book, but also the\r\nnumber of pages, to show whether the edition is the same. And if for all\r\nthose purposes you have got to turn to a second card, it seems to me it\r\nwould be unfortunate.\r\n\r\nMr. JONES: I agree strongly with Mr. Biscoe. I think the number of\r\nvolumes, size, etc., range in properly with the date, while the contents\r\nshould come afterward and range in with such matter as critical or\r\ndescriptive notes. Ordinarily you want those parts that I speak of\r\nfirst, then your contents, like any other kind of descriptive or\r\nexplanatory notes.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Mr. Biscoe's position appears at first sight very solid and\r\nplausible but there is nothing in it. The reason for this is that there\r\nis only a small class of books that will call for a contents note. I\r\ndeprecate mentioning any institution, particularly The John Crerar\r\nLibrary, but that calls for contents notes probably as often as any, and\r\nI should like our cataloger to answer if he knows about how many cases\r\nrun over on the second card.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: We have printed so far about 25,000 cards and the number\r\nof titles that run over to second cards is considerably below 1000; it\r\nis nearer 500 than 1000.\r\n\r\nMr. JONES: I should like to ask the chairman whether in foreign\r\nbibliographies we do not find that the data, as to volumes, size,\r\netc.--called the collation--always come first. Should not we be setting\r\nourselves up in opposition to other catalogers if we put the collation\r\nafter the contents?\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Possibly that it so; but if we gain a truth, what then?\r\nTradition is powerful, but it is not all. Sometimes it is very little\r\nindeed. And this is one of the cases in which I believe it is very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I hold in my hand one of the sample cards which have been\r\ndistributed, which has this arrangement. That represents what we now\r\ncall the old practice, which we are proposing to depart from--Cutter's\r\nRules say that the imprint, strictly, is place, date and form of\r\nprinting; and then goes on to say that for practical purposes the\r\nimprint is considered as being enlarged so as to contain not only place,\r\ndate and form of printing, but also publisher, number of pages and\r\nnumber of volumes. It seems to have been agreed some time ago by the\r\nCommittee on Rules and the Publishing Board that it was wise to bring\r\nback the imprint to the old idea of giving the place, date and form of\r\nprinting and publisher. It was also pretty generally agreed that\r\nform--or size as we now call it--number of pages and number of volumes,\r\nand anything else that might describe the book from an exterior point of\r\nview, should be called collation--we have not exactly agreed it should\r\nbe called that--and that this should be put in a statement by itself in\r\nsmaller type, after the title and imprint, the imprint being printed in\r\nthe same type as the title and even completing the line the title ends\r\non. Now the question is whether that line of smaller type should be\r\nprinted immediately after the title and imprint or whether it should\r\nfollow contents; that is to say, whether contents (called \"contents\" and\r\nnot \"contents note\") should not be attached immediately to the\r\ntitle--which is Mr. Hopkins's idea, I understand, as he thinks logically\r\nit belongs there. The card I have in my hand has contents occupying four\r\nlines, because while it is one volume it contains four different\r\nlectures. That brings before us the \"contents note\" and the other notes.\r\nNow I understand the new proposition is that the collation should\r\nfollow the contents note, but precede other notes.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: The thing I want is that the contents note should follow the\r\ntitle. I called it \"contents note\" merely because it appeared in the\r\nsmaller type with the other note.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I wish to express my preference in accord with Mr. Jones\r\nand one or two others, that the collation note should continue to occupy\r\nthe place it has always occupied, of immediate juxtaposition with the\r\nimprint, and other notes should go below.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: In explanation, permit me to take the floor again----\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Has not the officer of The John Crerar Library given the\r\nbest argument for placing the collation before the contents? Mr.\r\nJosephson has told us that probably the number of cards including\r\ncontents would be less than three per cent. Why should we not follow the\r\nold practice and let the cataloger and the public continue to use the\r\nusual thing?\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: I did not say how many cards give contents notes, but how\r\nmany titles need more than one card.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: That is the strong point. It is not three per cent. nor\r\nanywhere near it. Those cards that ran over were not all contents notes.\r\nThe actual number of contents notes that run over is very small indeed.\r\nAnd moreover, you have this bibliographical note on every card. You are\r\ngoing to put it between the contents note and the title every time.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRIS: I would like to ask what proportion of cards have contents\r\nnotes at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: I don't think I can answer that. It is between ten and\r\ntwenty-five per cent.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRIS: The point I was about to make was that I think it is well to\r\nsacrifice something for the sake of uniformity, for the aid of persons\r\nwho consult the catalog; and as Mr. Josephson says only fifteen to\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of the cards have contents notes, in seventy-five\r\nper cent. the collation would immediately follow the title. And\r\ntherefore it seems to me it is desirable not to have the contents note\r\nfollow the title.\r\n\r\nA show of hands was called for.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Before we have the show of hands, may I say one thing more? I\r\ndon't believe that most of you that have not been using these cards know\r\nhow useful the contents note is or what it is for. It is to furnish your\r\nanalyticals. If you want to analyze a volume of essays, for example,\r\nyour contents note does it all for you with just a little bit of\r\nclerical work when the cards come in. You have fifty items that you\r\nwould like to represent in your catalog, and the card does it all for\r\nyou. It is costing you one to three cents instead of fifty or sixty\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nMr. L. P. LANE: I have learned a good deal since I have been in the\r\nBoston Public Library by observing the practices which that library has\r\ndeparted from. I know the library did in times past print contents and\r\nhave an entry designed to fit one particular item of contents and then\r\nunderline that item on the card. That has been found so unsatisfactory\r\nthat when we now recatalog anything and deem any item of contents worthy\r\na separate entry we catalog that item separately and print a second\r\ncard.\r\n\r\nMr. ANDREWS: If the Library of Congress will do this we do not care for\r\nmany contents notes. I didn't understand the Library of Congress\r\nproposed to print analyticals, but rather to print contents notes; that\r\nthey, and most of the libraries that print cards, found their economy on\r\nthis point. But it is really the Library of Congress that must be\r\nconsulted as to the desirability of many contents notes.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: That has been one of the perplexing questions with us in\r\nprinting cards. We do use the contents as analyticals to some extent,\r\nunderscoring the particular item on the heading given. But where an\r\nanalytical is what we catalogers call an imprint analytical, that is,\r\nwith separate title and pagination, we find it more economical to print\r\na separate card for that title. In other cases and where we find it very\r\ninconvenient to use the contents card, we print analyticals.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: My own opinion is that it is best to put the collation at the\r\nend. It is easiest found there. The thing I want to see is to have it go\r\nbelow the contents. I want to say one thing more. The reason you think\r\nmore than one per cent. consult the note is because you are librarians.\r\nTake your popular libraries, and they deserve to be considered, how\r\nmany readers are going to look for that note?\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: I am somewhat undecided in mind between the two\r\nstandpoints. It seems to me that the contents, from the nature of the\r\ncase and from the accessibility of the catalog, belongs rather at the\r\ntop. I believe you are right when you say that ninety per cent. would\r\nuse the contents first, rather than the bibliographical note. But the\r\ncritical notes and any other general information should come right next\r\nto the contents.\r\n\r\nMr. JONES: I wish to repeat that \"collation\" is a bibliographical\r\ndescription of the book; if you want to describe a book or to order from\r\na bookseller you turn to that data. Collation, it seems to me, comes\r\nnaturally after the title, and I still hold that to separate it from the\r\ntitle is not in accord with the general bibliographical practice of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: As many as are in favor of placing contents note immediately\r\nfollowing the title, please rise. Three persons rose.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: As many as are in favor of placing contents note after\r\ncollation, please rise. 52 persons rose.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: The next question is a recommendation from the committee:\r\n\"_That a column be set aside in the Library Journal for notifications to\r\nlibraries of decisions on doubtful points; e. g., 'Kate Douglass Wiggin\r\nshould not be changed to Riggs; or, Automobiles should be classified\r\n...'_\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, that a kind of department be created, when the Central\r\nBureau is created, for giving librarians throughout the country a notion\r\nof how these matters are to be treated. What is the opinion? Is there\r\nany discussion? If not we will go on to the next point.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: No discussion means that we agree to it, I understand.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: I suppose so. If it doesn't you should say so quickly.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: Does this recommendation say _Journal_ or journals?\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: _Journal_ is the word used. The _Library Journal_ is the\r\nofficial organ of the A. L. A. Probably if the committee had gone beyond\r\nthat it would have been exceeding its province.\r\n\r\n\"_The committee earnestly recommends that the practice of giving dates\r\nof birth and death be used extensively. It is convinced that a very\r\nlarge share of the work has already been done and may be easily obtained\r\nfor the use of the Central Bureau. Expressions from various members of\r\nthe committee have shown a great readiness to assist in this._\"\r\n\r\nMr. MERRILL: I would like to inquire whether that means that dates shall\r\nbe given only to distinguish men of the same name or whether they shall\r\nbe used in every case.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: It is not designed that the use of dates be intended only for\r\ndistinguishing writers, but it is urged that dates be given extensively.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Doesn't that mean that the dates should be used where the\r\nauthors are not of the same names?\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: In the case of living authors, is it intended to give date\r\nof birth if possible?\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss BROWNE: At the Boston Athenæum for years they have been giving\r\nthose dates on their cards, and now they are scratching them off.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Does anybody know why?\r\n\r\nMiss BROWNE: I believe they consider they are not as desirable as a\r\nmeans of distinction as some phrase might be, and so they scratch off\r\nthe date and give, for instance, \"Henry James, _Novelist_; Emerson,\r\n_Essayist_.\"\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: How would they classify William Morris?\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: Or Andrew Lang?\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: The next question is the following recommendation of the\r\ncommittee: \"_The committee recommends that the Central Bureau prepare a\r\nbiographical card giving the fullest form of name, dates, official and\r\nhonorary titles and degrees, membership of academies, etc., and all\r\nforms of names and pseudonyms used._\"\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I suppose the idea is to prepare a biographical card for\r\neach author for whom any card is issued. I don't know exactly how it\r\nshould be worked. I want to call your attention to the fact that the\r\nAdvocates' Library of Edinburgh tried this in preparing the first two\r\nvolumes of their catalog; and when they got the two volumes printed\r\nthey concluded it was too expensive, and gave it up. I wonder how many\r\nlibraries would advocate that the Library of Congress shall furnish us\r\ncards, not only for the books, but whenever an author comes for whom\r\nthey have not furnished such a card that they shall furnish us a\r\nbiographical card, which we shall pay for? I do not understand that the\r\nLibrary of Congress is preparing such a card now. It may be worthy of\r\ndiscussion whether we want such a card prepared.\r\n\r\nMiss AMBROSE: It seems to me a card of that kind would be extremely\r\nhelpful in smaller libraries that are limited in biographical books.\r\n\r\nMr. JONES: I would suggest that in the case of authors for whom we most\r\nneed those facts, new authors, the facts would not be available. Could\r\nwe have a copyright note by which each author should furnish the desired\r\nfacts?\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Mr. Hanson could answer that, perhaps.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I have familiarity with copyright authors that many\r\nlibrarians do not meet with, but whom we must have information about to\r\ndistinguish from other well-known authors of the same name. We have a\r\nmethod of getting at them through the copyright records, and we write\r\nthem, sending a blank, and occasionally ask them to give information of\r\ntheir other works. That is put on a preliminary card, and before every\r\nnew author such a biographical card is inserted. I believe this is an\r\nold practice, used in many libraries.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: The Publishing Board would like a show of hands on how many\r\nlibraries would like such a biographical card. At first sight this\r\nstruck me as a most valuable suggestion. It would, of course, cost the\r\nextra half cent or cent--whatever it might be--for the card; on the\r\nother hand, it might be of great value to the reader. I suggest that we\r\nhave a show of hands, not _pro_ and _con_--simply _pro_.\r\n\r\nMiss VAN VALKENBURGH: I am especially interested in this, because we\r\ntried such a card in our library. We thought an information card was\r\ngoing to be a desirable thing. We tried it for about two years, and we\r\nfound it was very little used indeed for biographical purposes. People\r\nwanted more information than we could give on a biographical card. Of\r\ncourse it is very desirable to differentiate authors of the same name.\r\n\r\nMiss AMBROSE: Have those cards a distinct purpose, as of assisting the\r\ncatalogers aside from the public?\r\n\r\nMiss VAN VALKENBURGH: From the standpoint of a cataloger who has done\r\nit, we didn't find it useful to us. It was more work than help.\r\n\r\nMr. BRETT: Wouldn't it be more valuable to the small library than to the\r\nlarger library? A great many of the smaller libraries haven't time to\r\nlook up authors. It seems to me it would be of value in our library.\r\n\r\nMr. ANDREWS: I think those cards would be of use not only to small\r\nlibraries, but to readers in larger libraries. I do not say, though,\r\nthat I think it was the purpose to print a card for every author. If the\r\nheading used on the Library of Congress card gave all the information\r\ndesirable, I don't see any use of printing it again. I hope the\r\nproposition will be put in three forms: Those who want such a card for\r\nevery author; those who only want a distinctive card in cases where\r\ndistinction is desired; and those who do not care for such a card at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: As many as favor such a card for general use, please rise. 16\r\npersons rose.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: As many as favor such a card for distinctive purposes only,\r\nplease rise.\r\n\r\nMiss VAN VALKENBURGH: If we are going to have the same material on the\r\nother cards we won't need it here.\r\n\r\nOne person rose.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: As many as do not care for such a card at all, please rise.\r\nNone voted.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: We have still another of these topics: \"_The committee\r\nrecommends as strongly as it can the importance of placing the subject\r\nheadings and classification numbers (D.C. and E.C.) on the bottom of the\r\ncard._\"\r\n\r\nMiss BROWNE: These subject headings are simply suggestive. If any\r\ncataloger has already started with, for example, \"Birds\" instead of\r\n\"Ornithology,\" he can simply go on as he has begun. The same way with\r\nthe D.C. and E.C. numbers. There are certain ones that perhaps are\r\nabsolute; others are suggested to go in one place, but would go\r\nperfectly well in three or four other places; you take the one that fits\r\nin with your scheme; if you have no scheme you can use the one that is\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: The Committee on Rules has recommended this, and unless\r\nobjection is presented here this meeting might endorse this\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nW. M. SMITH: I don't see how these marks could be put on without\r\npreliminary classifying.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: If the work is done at the Library of Congress, of course\r\nthe book has to be classified, and it is very easy to translate any\r\nclassification mark into either D.C. or E.C. It would be an additional\r\ncost, of course, to print two or three headings at the bottom of the\r\ncard, but it has to be done.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: In other words, the work has to be done for the Library of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER: The subject headings are the most expensive part of the\r\ncatalog. It would be a mistake to leave off the marks.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: A show of hands is called for. As many as favor recommendation\r\nof this rule, please rise. 70 persons rose; contrary, none.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: I would like to say a word upon the question which was\r\nraised of printing certain matter in the _Library Journal_. While the\r\n_Library Journal_ is technically the official organ of the A. L. A. it\r\nwould seem desirable to send such material to all the library\r\nperiodicals, and I should suppose that it would be understood that the\r\ncommittee might so do.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: In the formal report of the committee to the Publishing Board\r\nthe same plan of numbering is followed that was followed in the last\r\nissue, or edition, of Cutter's rules, of the A. L. A. rules. A number of\r\nchanges, additions, excisions and emendations have been made. I will\r\nread the first.\r\n\r\n\"1a. Enter books under surnames of authors when ascertained, the\r\nabbreviation _Anon._ being added to the titles of works or editions\r\npublished anonymously.\"\r\n\r\nNow the question has been raised since, by a member of the committee,\r\nand it was desired that it be placed before this section for decision,\r\nIf the heading of an anonymous book is always bracketed is it necessary\r\nto add the abbreviation \"_Anon._\" to the end of the title?\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: It sometimes happens that an author signs his name at the\r\nend of the preface. In that case the name is not on the title-page, and\r\nshould be bracketed on the heading. We have to distinguish those from\r\nthe really anonymous books in some way. You have to do one of two\r\nthings, either put the abbreviation \"Anon.\" or the full word \"Anonymous\"\r\non the top line, or, as we do in The John Crerar Library, put a note at\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: It has been my experience that the word \"Anon.\" at the\r\nend of the line is sometimes confusing to the reader and brings up all\r\nsorts of questions, and is taking space that might be needed for\r\nsomething else. I do not see its value, and sometimes it is positively\r\nmisleading. The bracket expresses all that is of real use, and it\r\ndoesn't matter whether the author's name appears in some other place in\r\nthe book; at any rate it was not on the title-page. The brackets tell\r\nthat, and I don't see the use of the abbreviation.\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: I don't see that the public are interested in brackets or\r\nin the word \"Anon.\" It is for the public that the card is being made, I\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: When I spoke I went on the supposition that the title\r\nentry would, as is now usual, give the title only and omit the author's\r\nname from the title. But if, as I hope, the Publishing Board will decide\r\nto have the title-page copied exactly, giving the author's name in the\r\ntitle as it is done on the title-page, then you don't need to\r\ndistinguish the anonymous authors from those who have signed in any\r\nother place than the title-page, except that in the former case you put\r\na bracket around the name. As to the objection that the public is not\r\nconcerned with the brackets, that may be true; but the librarian is very\r\nmuch concerned with knowing whether a book is published anonymously or\r\nnot. I should like to have instead of brackets a footnote, telling\r\n\"published anonymously\" or \"signed at the end of title-page\" or \"signed\r\nat end of the book.\"\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I would like to call attention to one or two things. In\r\nthe first place, many popular libraries might like to have extremely\r\nsimple cards. They will have to realize that they must take a good deal\r\nof information they do not want if they are to take the cards made for\r\nall libraries. Mr. Josephson's idea is a good one, that technicalities\r\nshall be avoided in favor of good, plain English notes. \"Anon.\" is\r\nobscure to a great many people, while \"published anonymously\" is pretty\r\nplain English. If such a note follows it is not necessary to use any\r\nbrackets.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: I rise to suggest that we should discuss the question of\r\n_size notation_.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: What we have to consider here is whether this meeting\r\nwould favor one method or the other in size notation; and a\r\nconsideration of that question might be largely affected by the further\r\nquestion, Is either of these methods to be followed for the printed\r\ncards? If you should be told that in all probability neither of them\r\nwould be followed, it would prevent a good deal of waste of time in\r\ndiscussing one as against the other. We have two old methods that are\r\nmentioned in the reports. The third method, which finds a great deal of\r\nfavor and which may be adopted by the Publishing Board, is that the size\r\nnotation shall be represented by a mark giving the absolute measurement\r\nof the book, perhaps in centimeters, perhaps in inches and fractions.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: These three questions came before the committee at the\r\nmeeting at Atlantic City; one was to give the fold symbol, as is used\r\nall over Europe and in the larger libraries of this country; the other\r\nwas to give the letter symbol adopted by the A. L. A. in 1877; the\r\nthird, presented by Mr. Hopkins, was to give measurements in centimeters\r\nof the letterpress and of the page--not of the binding. A minority\r\nreport was submitted by Mr. Currier, Miss Kroeger and myself urging the\r\nfold symbol. Mrs. Fairchild, Mr. Cutter and Miss Browne are the\r\nmajority, because I understood Mr. Hopkins to stand with them.\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER: Mrs. Fairchild was undecided, saying she was inclined to\r\nthe exact measurement in centimeters; Miss Browne and Mr. Cutter voted\r\nfor the old letter symbol; so there was no majority of the committee.\r\nMr. Hopkins's vote was for the exact size. It was left with the\r\nPublishing Board to decide.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: The report is for the figure, but with a strong predilection\r\nof the members who signed it towards exact measurement, providing that\r\nshould be adopted by the Publishing Board. Three of us argued in favor\r\nof the fold symbol. There were too main reasons argued, one that the\r\ngreat majority of readers in this country were familiar with the figure;\r\nthe 4to, 8vo and 12mo gave them the size of the book; and that the\r\nmajority of libraries used that rather than the letter. The other was in\r\nfavor of uniformity. We found that the fold symbol as a measure of\r\nheight, not in the old sense, was advocated by the Prussian, the Italian\r\nand the French university libraries and others. But if the Publishing\r\nBoard should decide to adopt size measurement in centimeters I do not\r\nbelieve there is anyone of the committee who will insist very strongly\r\non the retention of the one or the other.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRIS: I think that bibliographically it is a mistake to take the\r\nold fold symbol and apply it to size notation. It is not size--it\r\nrepresents form notation. It is much simpler to give size in inches or\r\nin centimeters, whichever you prefer, rather than to use the symbol\r\nwhich denotes fold.\r\n\r\nL. P. LANE: It was said that the fold symbol was now almost never used\r\nto indicate the fold. In the Boston Public Library we use it to indicate\r\nthe fold for foreign books and old books. We also use the same symbol in\r\nthe case of American books to indicate size. There is considerable\r\ndissatisfaction with the practice and some of the cataloging staff would\r\nprefer to give the size in inches. How would that apply to books not in\r\nthe condition in which they were published? Also I should like to ask\r\nwhether it might not be possible where the fold is easily distinguished,\r\nto give both size and fold.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: That is really the practice of the Prussian university\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nMiss BROWNE: My thesis for defending the size letter is that 25 years\r\nago the A. L. A. thrashed this matter all over and decided on the size\r\nsymbol. Mr. Bowker has used that letter symbol from that time on. Miss\r\nKroeger found a very large proportion of the libraries using the letter\r\nsymbol; library classes are teaching the letter symbol. My chief\r\nobjection to the fold symbol is that we are making one sign serve two\r\nuses, which I think is always bad.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: If the Library Association 25 years ago decided to use\r\none symbol or another symbol, that is no reason why we should do so now.\r\nThe objection to using the fold symbol to denote size is, among other\r\nthings, as Mr. Lane suggested, that you need it in case of old books to\r\ntell the fold. The only rational designation of size is by centimeters,\r\nor inches, if you prefer. There is of course one difficulty in using\r\naccurate measurement in centimeters, if you have a book that has been\r\nbound and cut down. But that can be overcome, I think, by letting the\r\nmeasurement mean letterpress and nothing else. In ordinary cases you\r\nknow about how wide a margin is if you know the side of the letterpress;\r\nit is always a certain proportion. You don't need the size to tell on\r\nwhat shelf the book is put, because that is given by the call number. So\r\nin order to find a book you don't need the size notation; you need it to\r\nsee what size the page is. It is a purely bibliographical notation.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Hanson here read rule for size notation for books \"notable for age\r\nor rarity.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: In the days of our youth, in fact almost as soon as we were\r\nborn, this Association, as Miss Browne has indicated, adopted the letter\r\nsymbol; and it seems to me that the reasons that operated for the choice\r\nof the letter symbol are stronger now than they were then, because the\r\nsymbol has in the meantime come into quite general, if not universal\r\nuse. The Association at that time had a phrase to indicate size. The\r\nobjections to the old fold symbol still remain, and I think one very\r\nstrong one has been stated. It is not only that the numerical system of\r\n8vo, 12mo, etc., has ceased to mean what it originally meant and is\r\nconfused with measurement size, but that it is used in England and\r\nAmerica with utterly different meanings; and that difference continues.\r\nThat is to say, the English use crown octavo and post octavo and two or\r\nthree names for 12mo, in such a way as to cross our use of the word 8vo\r\nand 12mo and make a double confusion. I feel very strongly, for one,\r\nthat the method of breaking over from the octavo and duodecimo, etc.,\r\nthe figure designation, into a definite and accurate letter designation\r\nwas a very ingenious and very useful move. It is difficult to get\r\ngeneral adoption of a modification of that sort, but the adoption has\r\nbeen quite general, and to me it would seem a very great retrogression\r\nto go back to the old figure symbol; we had better adhere to the A. L.\r\nA. notation of 25 years ago and custom since, and give a symbol which is\r\nin no sense confusing or misleading, following that, if you please, with\r\nthe actual size measurement in centimeters.\r\n\r\nMr. RODEN: I understand, of course, that we cannot legislate upon the\r\nsubject, and possibly our discussion will not influence the legislature.\r\nAt the same time, as a representative of a popular library in the middle\r\nwest, I cannot help but regard with apprehension the small but insidious\r\ninnovations which these rules seem to display. Mr. Josephson has said\r\nmeasurement is a bibliographical detail; in popular libraries it is a\r\ngratuitous detail. It could very well, as the chairman suggests, be\r\nplaced at the end. In the public I am dealing with I should say the old\r\nfold symbol is most commonly used and means most. It occurs to me that a\r\ncombination of fold and letter symbols might be used. I suggest this as\r\na little concession to the popular library, and it is the first I have\r\nheard this afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. JONES: An objection to exact measurement is, that so far as the\r\ngreater mass of books that we have to deal with are concerned, it is not\r\nvery important whether they are a few centimeters larger or smaller, and\r\nsuch books are often rebound in such a way that if we have an exact\r\ndescription our copies do not correspond. I agree with Mr. Bowker that\r\nthe symbols adopted by the A. L. A. 25 years ago are sufficiently well\r\nknown by people who are handling books to be recommended as a system to\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER: I have been teaching in the library school according to A.\r\nL. A. measurements, yet it has always seemed to me somewhat absurd. None\r\nof the publishers have adopted it; I suppose the newer libraries have.\r\nThe replies received to the questions sent to the various libraries\r\nlast June, except for the newer libraries, indicate that the majority\r\nare using the fold symbol, and they would like to know why, if the\r\nletter symbol is such a good thing, the publishers are still marking\r\ntheir books 8vo, 12mo and 4to. The fold symbol means more to the mass of\r\nthe people than do the letters O or D.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: If I remember correctly the London _Bookseller_ is giving\r\nthe exact size and measurement now.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRIS: Many literary and critical journals give the size of all\r\nbooks recorded in inches.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: The Publishing Board is extremely interested in getting the\r\nfeeling of those here on the question. I want to suggest that when it\r\ncomes to the rising vote or show of hands, we take a somewhat\r\ncomplicated vote: those who are in favor of the present A. L. A. letter;\r\nthose in favor of returning to the fold (I mean not in the usual sense);\r\nthose in favor of exact measurement in centimeters; those in favor of a\r\ncombination of letter symbol and centimeter; and those in favor of the\r\nfold symbol and centimeter. The board wants all the information it can\r\nget.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: I will ask Mr. Bowker to state the first proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Those in favor of the letter symbol, the present A. L. A.\r\nmethod, please rise. Twenty-four rose.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Those in favor of returning to the fold symbol, the 8vo,\r\n12mo and 4to please rise. Ten rose.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Those who prefer a designation of actual measurement, please\r\nrise--with the understanding that those voting for this will then vote\r\ntheir preference as to either inches or centimeters. Seventeen rose.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Your next proposition, Mr. Bowker.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Those who would prefer centimeters if exact measurement\r\nshould be adopted, please rise. Thirty-two rose.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Now those who would prefer inches if an exact measurement\r\nwere adopted. Three rose.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: As many as are in favor of the exact measurement coupled with\r\nthe A. L. A. symbol, in case there is to be a combination--letter and\r\nexact size--please rise. Thirty-two rose.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Now those who would prefer the combination of exact size with\r\nfigure symbol. Sixteen rose.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: We might have another vote on whether the size should\r\nmean letterpress or book.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Before this is done I want to call attention to the effect of\r\nbinding after cataloging. If this scheme is going to take in foreign\r\nbooks, and you are going to get cards promptly, a large share of the\r\nbooks will be cataloged before they are bound. If a good binder does his\r\nwork conscientiously and as it should be done, if you give the page you\r\nwill have a more satisfactory measurement.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I have looked into this question recently, and I find, where\r\nlibraries do measure in centimeters they measure the paper. If the book\r\nis bound they measure the outside cover, for the reason that when the\r\nunbound book is trimmed down for binding what is lost is regained in the\r\nbinding. I have found no instance yet where the practice that is\r\nadvocated by yourself, the measurement of the letterpress, is followed\r\nin actual work.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: Let all those who want an exact measurement of the\r\nletterpress please rise. Two rose.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: Now those who want size to mean the outside of the book.\r\nFifty-five rose.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: I think it might clarify things if we take the vote of those\r\nwho favor the use of the symbol alone as against those who favor the use\r\nof the symbol and exact measurement in centimeters.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Those who favor the use of the symbol alone as against the\r\ncombination of symbol with measurement please rise. Twenty-three rose.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Those who favor combination of symbol with exact\r\nmeasurement, please rise. Fifteen rose.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: If there is no other business I wish to move the very\r\ncordial appreciation of the Catalog Section of the admirable report\r\nwhich has been presented in such detail by the advisory committee of the\r\nPublishing Board. _Voted._\r\n\r\nMr. BOWKER: Mr. Hanson, as chairman of the committee, I have great\r\npleasure in conveying to you and to your associates this appreciation,\r\nwhich I know is most thorough on the part of all here.\r\n\r\nI would also like to move a vote of thanks to the chairman for his\r\nadmirable presiding during the session. _Voted._\r\n\r\nL. P. LANE: I move that the program committee be requested to assign a\r\ntime before the end of the conference when there may be a continued\r\nmeeting of this section; and if such a time be found, that when we\r\nadjourn we adjourn to that time. _Voted._\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Let me announce again that at the close of this session the\r\nsecretary, Miss Van Valkenburgh, will be ready to begin the registry of\r\npersons who express themselves as willing to become members of this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nMr. ANDREWS: I would call attention to the fact that under the by-laws,\r\nif the section wants to, it can adopt rules restricting membership; if\r\nit doesn't adopt rules any member of the Association may be a member of\r\nthis section. It is a question whether we wish to confine this section\r\nto catalogers.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: It is an important point or might easily become an important\r\npoint. For the ordinary run of affairs it would be a matter of no\r\nconsequence, but it may be that this section will sometime wish to\r\npromulgate some proposition and a little logrolling might vote it down.\r\nWhat does the section wish to do in this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. WINDSOR: I think we can safely leave it open to all who are\r\ninterested in the subject of cataloging. I don't see that there is\r\nanything gained by leaving out anybody who is interested in the work.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: I move that a vote on this question be postponed.\r\n_Voted._\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: In the points that were outlined last year for discussion at\r\nthis meeting there were a great many details; we have not reached a\r\nfifth of them. May I ask catalogers to get copies of the rules\r\nrecommended by the Committee on Rules and look them over and communicate\r\nwith any one of the members of the committee--Mr. Hopkins, Miss Kroeger,\r\nMiss Brown or myself. It would be of the greatest assistance to us.\r\n\r\n[Miss Kroeger objected to giving out copies of the rules, because they\r\nwere incomplete.]\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: I think we have no right to make a general distribution yet,\r\nto do so would perhaps exceed the province of the committee; but we\r\nmight lend copies to those who want to look them over.\r\n\r\nI will now call for the report of the _Committee on Nominations_.\r\n\r\n[The committee reported the names of Mr. Hanson, of the Library of\r\nCongress, for chairman, and Miss Mary E. Hawley, Chicago Public Library,\r\nfor secretary.]\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I am the chairman of the advisory committee and we have a\r\ngreat deal of hard work before us. I would ask the section to accept my\r\nresignation. I really do not feel I can give the time necessary to make\r\nthis section a success at the next meeting.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: There are no rules governing us, Mr. Hanson, but I beg that\r\nyou do not insist on this, or if you feel you must resign that you do so\r\nbetween now and the next session.\r\n\r\nThe names submitted were unanimously elected, and adjournment was taken\r\nsubject to call of chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _SECOND SESSION._\r\n\r\nThe second session of the Catalog Section was called to order on\r\nWednesday, July 10, ANDERSON H. HOPKINS presiding.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: The matters that were of first importance to be brought before\r\nthe section were discussed yesterday. At the same time there are other\r\nthings that I am sure would be interesting; and perhaps you would prefer\r\nto bring up your own topics, and each present something you would like\r\nto talk about.\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: Is the Y. M. C. A. question proper for discussion?\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: I believe that question was received; please read it, Mr.\r\nHanson.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON (reading): Young Men's Christian Associations, mercantile\r\nlibrary associations and the like are to be entered under place. That is\r\n1 i 21 of the rules suggested.\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: It is our practice to put the Y. M. C. A. under Y. M. C.\r\nA.; Y. M. C. A., Boston; Y. M. C. A., New York; instead of putting it\r\nunder place. There is a separate association which has a distinctive\r\nbeing and the local associations are branches. It seems this is much\r\nmore logical, and where the public would expect to find reports of the\r\nY. M. C. A.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I wish to state in support of Miss Wagner's contention that\r\nMr. Cutter in his new edition, which is now in manuscript, was rather in\r\nfavor of changing his rule, which reads as this one does. He has always\r\nadvised entering under the place; but he was now inclined to enter under\r\nYoung Men's Christian Association, not only for the general association\r\nof the United States, but for the associations of the various states. A\r\nmajority of the committee, however, seemed inclined to enter the local\r\nY. M. C. A. under the place, on the ground that 99 per cent. would look\r\nfor Chicago Y. M. C. A. under Chicago, Philadelphia Y. M. C. A. under\r\nPhiladelphia, rather than under Y. M. C. A.; and that the same was true\r\nof the mercantile library associations.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: Was any argument brought forth to substantiate that\r\nstatement that nine-tenths of the people would look under the local\r\nname?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: No contention, except that it seemed to be the general\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: It seems to me if the committee would correspond with\r\npublic libraries there might be some change of opinion on the matter.\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: I find that Chicago enters Y. M. C. A. under Y. M. C. A.,\r\nas the St. Louis Public Library does.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: The logical thing has always seemed the fair thing in\r\nthis matter--to ask one's self the question, Has the organization a\r\nnational existence? And if so, to enter it under the generic name. The\r\nY. M. C. A. has a national existence, which is more important as a\r\ngoverning body than any one of the local associations. And the same is\r\ntrue of other organizations. If they have no national organization, then\r\nI enter them under the local name; but if there is a national\r\nassociation, then I enter under the generic name.\r\n\r\nMiss AMBROSE: Would you follow the same reasoning for entries under\r\nMethodist Episcopal church, or would you put them under the place? It\r\nseems to me the same reasoning would apply.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: I shouldn't wish this logical process to supersede the\r\nbetter rule of entering under the best known form. And I think in the\r\ncase Miss Ambrose mentions the best known form would be the locality.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: Miss Wagner's question has launched us into the center of\r\nthe most difficult problem of all--that is, corporate entry, entry of\r\nsocieties and institutions. There is an underlying principle which\r\ngoverns our distinctions, I believe. There is a distinction to be made\r\nbetween societies, and to some extent institutions; societies, including\r\nroyal academies, which are societies, to be entered under the first word\r\nnot an article; on the other hand, institutions, galleries, museums,\r\nlibraries, etc., which generally have buildings and are affiliated\r\nclosely with the place, to be entered under place, unless they have\r\nother distinctive names--that is to say, names from persons or\r\ngeographical locations. That principle would to some extent affect the\r\nYoung Men's Christian Associations and mercantile libraries.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: Would that override the other rule of entering under the\r\nbest known form? Would the institution entry override the principle of\r\nentering under best known form?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: That rule we have not formulated. We have not considered as\r\nbroad a rule as that--entry under best known form. We have tried to lay\r\ndown some rule that should govern entry under place and entry under\r\nname; and what we are really trying to get at is best known form.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: I appreciate that, and there ought to be some ground on\r\nwhich to make exceptions. I think your distinction between institutions\r\nand societies is a good one. Is not the Y. M. C. A. a good case to make\r\nan exception?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: Yes, that is the 21st exception, is it not, under the rule?\r\nThe general rule is, \"Enter societies under the first word not an\r\narticle or serial number, of its corporate name.\" Then there are 22\r\nexceptions, and we began with the 21st.\r\n\r\nL. P. LANE: I don't know whether the practice of the Boston Public\r\nLibrary is of interest, but personally I incline to the views Miss\r\nCrawford has expressed. The Boston Public Library strives to use the\r\ncorporate name where there is a corporate name, carrying that practice,\r\nI think, to an extreme degree, so that they enter Chamber of Commerce\r\nunder Chamber of Commerce, so and so. I understand under this rule\r\nChamber of Commerce would be entered under the name of the place.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: Yes. We propose to enter all boards of trade, all chambers\r\nof commerce under the name of the city or state.\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER: That comes under rule 1 i 9: If a body's name begins with\r\nsuch words as \"board,\" \"corporation,\" \"trustees,\" enter that part of the\r\nname by which they are usually known.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: This will be very helpful to the committee, because it shows\r\nthat in the case of exception 21 there is a strong sentiment of entering\r\nit under name instead of under place.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: Would you make that same application to mercantile\r\nlibraries? It seems to me in that case the place is what people would\r\nlook for, just as they would for a public library.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: Yes, personally I should feel disposed to give in on the Y.\r\nM. C. A. question, but not on the mercantile library.\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: The mercantile library has no general organization. If you\r\nenter the local Y. M. C. A. under the city you are forcing the people to\r\nlook in perhaps 30 or 40 places.\r\n\r\nMr. BISCOE: Is it the purpose of the author arrangement to show what the\r\nlibrary has on Y. M. C. A.?\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: It is the purpose to show what the library owns under the\r\nauthorship of the Y. M. C. A. And to find that you force the person to\r\nlook into as many different places as there are Y. M. C. A.'s\r\nrepresented in your catalog. The person who comes to your catalog\r\nwanting to know what Y. M. C. A. publications you have has a right to\r\nfind them in one place.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: He could always find it by cross-reference under the general\r\nY. M. C. A. to every local Y. M. C. A. represented in the catalog. The\r\ncontention at the meeting of the committee was that in a great majority\r\nof cases a man is interested in a particular Y. M. C. A. If he comes to\r\nstudy all Y. M. C. A.'s the catalog must make provision to help him.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: I am one who maintains the thesis that no one has a right to\r\nexpect to find everything pertaining to Y. M. C. A. under Y. M. C. A. in\r\nthe author catalog.\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: It seems to me in the author catalog you have a right to\r\nexpect to find what the author has written, therefore you have a right\r\nto find what the Y. M. C. A. is responsible for.\r\n\r\nMr. BISCOE: Why isn't it the same thing to expect to find out everything\r\nabout the Episcopal church under \"Episcopal church\"? Isn't every branch\r\nof the Episcopal church a part of the general Episcopal church?\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: The answer in our library would be that nobody asks for\r\nthat information, as they do for the Y. M. C. A.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Are you sure the reason they ask for the Y. M. C. A. in that\r\nway is not because you catalog it that way, and they have learned to\r\nlook for it there?\r\n\r\nMiss WAGNER: My answer is that for the last seven years we entered Y. M.\r\nC. A. under place. The change was made in agreement with the demand at\r\nthe issue desk.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: That is just the kind of thing we want to find out.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: Under 1 i 12 what would you advise regarding the Carnegie\r\nlibraries which in large numbers have assumed the name Carnegie since\r\nthe endowment of the building? Would you give them all as Carnegie\r\nlibraries of so-and-so, or would you still preserve the form showing the\r\nlibrary was supported by the city in which it was? For example,\r\nPittsburgh Carnegie Library and Atlanta Carnegie Library--introducing\r\nthe word Carnegie right after the city? Or would you advise putting the\r\nword Carnegie for all of these libraries?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I have not had to deal with that question. I should think\r\nthey would be entered under the name of the city, and then if you want\r\nto bring the entire Carnegie record together you can make a second\r\nentry.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: This raises the question whether or not the designation\r\n\"Carnegie library\" is an official one. If it is not, then it is a name\r\nwhich has come up by common consent, and it seems to me that nothing but\r\ntime would enable us to determine exactly how it should be treated; the\r\nconservative thing would be to use the name of the place.\r\n\r\nMiss AMBROSE: I would like to hear an expression of opinion--it is the\r\nsame principle in three different places, 1 i 4, 1 i 5 and 1 i 16--as to\r\nentering professional schools, libraries and observatories separately if\r\nthey have distinctive names separate from the corporations that they\r\nbelong to.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I think it would be better to enter the colleges of American\r\nuniversities under the name of the university. It is an easy rule to\r\nfollow and a rule that has been followed in American libraries. On the\r\nother hand we have peculiar cases--the medical schools, for instance,\r\nwhich have distinctive names and are often situated a hundred miles from\r\nthe mother school. \"College libraries and local college societies under\r\nthe name of the college, but the Bodleian library may be put under\r\nBodleian. Intercollegiate societies and Greek letter fraternities under\r\nthe name.\" I think all will agree with that. 1 i 16, \"Observatories\r\nunder the name of the place, except that those having distinctive names\r\nare to be entered under that name. Refer for university observatories\r\nfrom the university.\" I personally think that is unfortunate; I would\r\nprefer to see university and observatories under university. For\r\ninstance, for Washburn observatory I would say, \"Wisconsin university,\r\nWashburn observatory.\"\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: Under 1 h 1, \"Enter Government bureaus or offices\r\nsubordinate to a department directly under the country not as\r\nsub-heading under departments.\" Is it proposed to invert the name of the\r\nbureau or office so as to bring the distinctive name to the fore or let\r\nit read in its natural way?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: The practice of inverting has been followed, I think, in the\r\nmajority of American catalogs. We have not as yet inverted our headings.\r\nWe are printing them in the order in which they read, as \"Bureau of\r\nEducation\"; but that does not mean we may not arrange entries under\r\nUnited States, _Education_.\r\n\r\nL. P. LANE: It seems to me it would be most desirable to harmonize the\r\npractice of the Superintendent of Documents with the Library of Congress\r\nin this matter. In the \"Comprehensive catalogue\" there is this\r\ninversion, and it seems to me it has been very judiciously done. In the\r\npresent practice of the Boston Public Library, however, it is not done.\r\n\r\nMiss AMBROSE: I should like a definition of the word \"local\" in 1 i 20.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: 1 i 20: \"Purely local benevolent or moral or similar\r\nsocieties under the place.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cutter said that he had more trouble with this rule than with any\r\nother. He had, in fact, I believe decided to enter under name, not under\r\nplace, but it seems during the discussion he changed back to the old\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER: That was in deference to the majority vote. Mr. Cutter's\r\nopinion favored entry under name.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: His reason seemed to be that those referring to these local\r\nsocieties were the citizens of the place where they were situated and\r\nthey sought the name of the society. If the people in other states,\r\nusing other catalogs, were looking for the societies, they would not\r\nremember the name. In fact, the only thing that remains in one's memory\r\nis the name of the place, and one naturally would look under the place\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: As I understand Miss Ambrose she raises the question how large\r\na locality might be meant--whether it should go to the limits of a\r\ncounty or a state. I should have supposed it meant a narrower locality\r\nand would apply to a city or town--a vicinage.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPHSON: Perhaps it might be well to let the word \"local\" mean\r\nhere what it means in \"local geography\"--anything belonging to the\r\nstate--not taking in towns.\r\n\r\nI should like to bring up 1 k: \"Enter commentaries accompanied by the\r\nfull text of the work under the name of the author.\" And then exceptions\r\nonly when the text is not to be readily distinguished from the\r\ncommentary. We have a good many cases where the text is particularly\r\nshort--a text of from four or five or ten pages--and then comes a\r\ncommentary of several hundred pages. It seems absurd to catalog a text\r\nof five or ten pages accompanied by a commentary of five or six hundred\r\npages under the name of the author of the text.\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER: That is provided for in the rule. \"Except when the text is\r\ndistributed through the commentary in such a manner as not to be readily\r\nrecognized or is insignificant as compared with the commentary.\" That is\r\ndesigned to fit just such cases.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: There is another rule, on laws, 1 h 3: \"Laws on one or more\r\nparticular subjects, whether digested or merely collected, to be entered\r\nunder the collector or digester, with added entry under country.\"\r\n\r\nI think that is a departure from the present practice, which has been to\r\nenter New York laws on state taxation under New York, State Legislature,\r\nand secondly under compiler or collector.\r\n\r\nMiss AMBROSE: If you had a compilation of road laws of Illinois, you\r\nwould put that under the compiler first and secondly under Illinois\r\nState Legislature?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: Yes.\r\n\r\nL. P. LANE: Under 1 h and 1 q I would like to ask whether a proclamation\r\nby the king of England would be put under England, or Great Britain,\r\nKing, or under Edward VII.?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: We enter such publications in two places; the official\r\nproclamations or edicts under the name of the country with a subdivision\r\nfor king or sovereign, and then their private publications under their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: 1 j: \"Enter a periodical under the first word, not an\r\narticle or serial number, of its title.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the judgment of the committee upon newspapers? Should they\r\nalways be entered under the first word of their title, or would it be\r\nbetter to enter under the name of the place?\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER: We consulted Mr. Fletcher about the rules, and he\r\nsuggested this very point, bringing up the question of newspapers. And\r\nwe have a rough draft of a rule to enter newspapers under the name of\r\nthe place, putting the name of the place in brackets and not in the\r\ntitle. 1 j also brings up the question as to whether it is to be under\r\nthe first word of the current title or of the original title.\r\n\r\nMiss GRAHAM: 1 i 15: \"Exhibitions under the name of the place where they\r\nare held.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem to me that in the case of the Pan-American Exposition,\r\nthat should be first, rather than Buffalo. Also the Columbian\r\nExposition.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: I think a majority of the expositions in this country have\r\nspecific names. In the discussion of the committee I think Mr. Cutter\r\nproposed the rule as follows: \"Enter under the name of the place in case\r\nof expositions, always making a cross-reference from the special name of\r\nthe exposition, if it has one.\" In all cases it would be necessary that\r\nthe cross-reference should be made from the special name by which it is\r\nknown--as the Cotton States, Pan-American, World's Columbian.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: Is there anything more to say on this subject? If not, Miss\r\nGraham, you might bring up that question you spoke to me about this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMiss GRAHAM: The matter Mr. Hopkins refers to was regarding the revision\r\nof the \"A. L. A. catalog\" of the 5000 best books. We feel the need in\r\nsmall libraries, and I think the need is felt where libraries are trying\r\nto organize, for a revision of that catalog. We all use that in small\r\nlibraries when making out lists of standard works. There are many of\r\nthem out of print. If we could have a revision of that catalog on\r\nprinted cards it seems to me it would be a great help in the work of\r\nlibrary extension as well as to smaller libraries which have little\r\ncataloging force--where the librarian has to be cataloger.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: I thought perhaps enough would be interested in this to raise\r\nthe question in such a way that the Publishing Board would take it up.\r\nIt may be cards are in existence that might be reprinted for this work.\r\n\r\nMiss AMBROSE: There is a supplement to this catalog just about ready to\r\ncome out. Would that include new editions or simply new books?\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: The matter has been put off to such a large extent that\r\nthe State Library at Albany has undertaken to publish this supplement;\r\nbut it has been delayed. They intend to print it for their own state\r\nuse, but allow the Publishing Board to distribute it to other places. As\r\nto a revision, I do not know whether it has been undertaken. I think\r\nthat the original edition was not electrotyped, and that there are no\r\nplates existing to reprint it from.\r\n\r\nCHAIRMAN: I will read a question from the Hartford Public Library on the\r\narrangement of author, editor and translator in a card catalog--whether\r\nto be put in one alphabet or arranged separately?\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: That hits upon a very practical experience which we had\r\nin Dayton. We arranged the works of an author under the author's own\r\nworks; then the author as editor; and then author as joint author; and\r\nthen the author as translator; alphabeting by the word which happened to\r\nfollow the name of the author at the top of the line. We tried that for\r\nthree or four years, and at the end of that time we ourselves in our own\r\nuse of the catalog were so continually running up against our own\r\narrangement as a thing which we never used and which was a constant\r\nblunder to us that last year we set about rearranging all the authors so\r\nas to bring them in one alphabeting order by the first word of the\r\ntitle, regardless of whether it was as author, editor or compiler. Of\r\ncourse when translator or editor of a specific person's work, that entry\r\nwas placed after the others.\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: That is our practice, after having used the other for some\r\ntime. We now undertake to put all the works of an author in a general\r\nseries, whether he is author, or editor, or collector, or whatever it\r\nbe, if the work is significant as his work. We put those all in one\r\nalphabet, as if there was no such addition after his name, and then we\r\nput at the end the two notes which are in the nature of cross-reference.\r\nIf a man is translator of somebody else's work we cannot very well put\r\nthose in as his works. Everything else we put in one series.\r\n\r\nMr. PERLEY: In the library of the Institute of Technology, of Boston, we\r\narranged the authors, joint authors, translators and editors all in one\r\ncommon alphabet. It seems to me in a library of this kind such an\r\narrangement is especially good, because the public patrons of the\r\nlibrary never seem to take very kindly to distinctions, however\r\ninteresting they may be to the librarians; and it happens very often\r\nthat the American translator is a good deal more important to the\r\nAmerican reader than the original author from whom it was translated.\r\nAnd in the same way a joint author may take equal rank with the author\r\nin the main entry.\r\n\r\nMiss CRAWFORD: 1 o: \"Enter under highest title unless family name or\r\nlower title is decidedly better known.\" Will you keep the title in the\r\nvernacular in all cases? For example, will you always say \"Fürst von\"\r\ninstead of the English form, and \"Graf von,\" etc.?\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON: There is a varying practice as to that. I will say for the\r\nLibrary of Congress, where they are purely titles of honor or minor\r\nnoblemen, we use the vernacular; but we have found it advisable for\r\nkings, in fact for sovereigns, to use the designation king, emperor,\r\npope, etc., in English.\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER: Has anything been said about entering sovereigns and popes\r\nin the vernacular or English form? The rule says, \"_May_ be given in the\r\nEnglish form.\"\r\n\r\nMr. FLETCHER: I think we should generally feel, as Mr. Cutter expresses\r\nit in his rule, that this is a matter of progress; and before long our\r\nlibrary committees will not tolerate \"Henry\" instead of \"Henri\" for king\r\nof France, or \"Lewis\" instead of \"Louis.\" We are in a transition stage,\r\nand this \"May be\" means that it is considered allowable while we are in\r\nthe transition stage to use the English form instead of the vernacular.\r\nBut give names of sovereigns in the vernacular. The same thing is true\r\nof names of cities. Some librarians are leading us a little and giving\r\nWien for Vienna.\r\n\r\nMr. PERLEY: It seems to me the use of the English form would largely\r\ndepend upon the length of the custom. I think for the names of the\r\nItalian cities which have been given common English names since the\r\nMiddle Ages we are justified in using the English forms, and the names\r\nof persons in the same way.\r\n\r\nAdjourned without day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SECTION FOR CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS.[G]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe A. L. A. Section for Children's Librarians held two sessions during\r\nthe Waukesha conference. In the absence of Miss Annie Carroll Moore,\r\nchairman of the section, the chair was occupied by Miss L. E. STEARNS,\r\nwho presided as honorary chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _FIRST SESSION._\r\n\r\nThe first session of the section was called to order at 2.15 p.m.,\r\nFriday, July 5.\r\n\r\nThe secretary read a communication from the chairman, Miss Moore, who\r\nextended her cordial greeting to the Children's Librarians' Section, and\r\nexpressed regret that she was unable to be present. She also expressed\r\nher satisfaction that the meetings should be conducted by one whose\r\ncontributions to the work of children's librarians, both by the pen and\r\nthe power of her magnetic personality, have been so far-reaching in\r\ntheir influence. Miss Stearns' paper given at the Lake Placid\r\nconference, 1894, she believed to be one of the most important\r\ncontributions to the development of work with children, as it set people\r\nthinking and talking, and stimulated activity along the lines indicated.\r\nIn regard to the establishment of a separate section of the A. L. A.,\r\nMiss Moore said: \"It is most encouraging and gratifying to feel that we\r\nhave the support of those whose interest in library work for children\r\nprecedes our own, and whose wise counsel may be counted upon in\r\nconsidering the problems which have arisen out of a practical\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\"It has been the chief object in the construction of this first program\r\nto define certain phases of our work in order that we may proceed with a\r\nclearer vision of its significance and with a better idea of how we are\r\nto accomplish the results at which we seem to be aiming. It is hoped\r\nthat succeeding meetings may be rich in profitable discussions of\r\npractical problems, but let us plan our programs with the utmost care,\r\nthat we may gather a body of matter which shall prove valuable for the\r\nfuture as well as enlightening in the present.\r\n\r\n\"Most hearty thanks are due to all who have assisted in the making of\r\nthe program, and to those who have volunteered to carry it to a\r\nsuccessful issue.\r\n\r\n\"We feel especially grateful to the librarians at large who have so\r\ngenerously responded by the preparation of papers, or by participating\r\nin the discussions, to this special claim of ours upon their time and\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary read a statement regarding\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE CLUB OF CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS.\r\n\r\nAt the A. L. A. conference in Montreal in 1900 an informal meeting was\r\nheld for the purpose of personal acquaintance and co-operation among\r\nthose actively engaged in library work with children.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this meeting an organization was formed, to be known as\r\nthe Club of Children's Librarians, of which Miss A. C. Moore was made\r\nchairman, and Miss M. E. Dousman secretary. In order to facilitate the\r\nwork of the club it was decided to divide the work into departments,\r\neach department to be in charge of a chairman appointed by the chair.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the club was instructed to inform the secretary of the\r\nAmerican Library Association of the formation of the club and to offer\r\nits services in the making of the program for future sessions on library\r\nwork with children, if so desired.\r\n\r\nThe result of this proposition was that at a meeting of the executive\r\nboard of the A. L. A. it was voted that a section for library work with\r\nchildren be established, providing such section be acceptable to the\r\nofficers of the Club of Children's Librarians. The section was accepted,\r\nand the program for the same was submitted by the officers of the club\r\nto the program committee of the A. L. A.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a section devoted to work with children, as a\r\nresult of the efforts of the club, is a matter of congratulation for all\r\nthose interested in this branch of library work. Special thanks are due\r\nthe chairman, Miss Moore, for her unremitting efforts in making the\r\nprogram for the sessions helpful and inspiring. Thanks are also due\r\nchairmen of committees for their zeal in collecting valuable material\r\nand for the presentation of practical and suggestive reports.\r\n\r\nIn view of the establishment of the Section for Children's Librarians,\r\nwhich makes possible the thorough treatment of children's library work,\r\nit seems desirable that the Club of Children's Librarians be no longer\r\ncontinued, its special purpose being accomplished; at the present\r\nmeeting of the section it is hoped to perfect its organization and\r\noutline its plans for the coming year.\r\n\r\nThe first paper of the session was by Miss CAROLINE M. HEWINS, and in\r\nher absence was read by Miss HELEN E. HAINES. It dealt with\r\n\r\n  BOOK REVIEWS, LISTS AND ARTICLES ON CHILDREN'S READING: ARE THEY OF\r\n              PRACTICAL VALUE TO THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN?\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 57.)\r\n\r\nThe subject was discussed by Miss HAINES, who said:\r\n\r\nMiss Hewins' criticisms and deductions are so sound that there is little\r\nto add to what she has said, except in the way of assent. The children's\r\nlibrarian who relies only upon what she can find in print to tell her\r\nwhat she ought to think about children's literature, leans upon a broken\r\nreed. In general, reviews in this field are valueless, owing to lack of\r\ndiscrimination and of good taste, and to indifference. The reason for\r\nthis is the unimportance of the subject, from the standpoint of the\r\naverage reviewer or literary editor. Miss Hewins has stated with entire\r\nfairness the conditions that control reviews of children's books.\r\nChristmas time--the \"rush season\"--is practically the only time when\r\nthey are given attention, and then owing to the great mass of review\r\ncopies to be handled, notices are most inadequate. Indeed, most of these\r\nnotices are evolved from material supplied by the publisher with the\r\nbook--the trail of the publisher is over them all.\r\n\r\nThere is not yet among children's librarians a sufficient \"body of\r\ndoctrine\"--critical judgment, knowledge of books--to produce\r\nsatisfactory library lists. Such lists are too often made up from\r\nhearsay, or through selection from other lists, which is almost always\r\nunsatisfactory. The most prevalent and serious defect in these annotated\r\nlibrary lists is the use of too many words which mean nothing. In this\r\nwork especially \"the adjective is the enemy of the substantive.\" Even\r\nthe Carnegie list, excellent as a whole and probably the best of the\r\nkind yet published, is crude in some respects, and would stand pruning.\r\nThere is too frequent use of such phrases as \"a wholesome book,\" \"a\r\ncheery tale,\" \"a children's classic,\" and there is too great a\r\npreponderance of American books, of commonplace \"series,\" of books in\r\nwhat may be called the public-school rut. As an example of \"what not to\r\ndo\" in book annotation, extracts may be given from a recent annotated\r\nlist of children's books, which included the following:\r\n\r\nWarner, S. The wide, wide world.\r\n\r\nMiss Warner is one of the best friends a young girl can have as\r\nchaperone into the delightful kingdom of romance.\r\n\r\nWeyman, S. The house of the wolf.\r\n\r\nA modern English version of a curious French memoir written about 1620.\r\n\r\nChurch. Three Greek children.\r\n\r\nMr. Church is an accomplished restorer of the antique, and has a keen\r\ndiscrimination for points appealing to child-like magnetism.\r\n\r\nCooper. The spy.\r\n\r\nA story founded upon fact. The same adventitious causes which gave birth\r\nto the book determined its scenes and its general character.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that not one of these annotations conveys an idea of\r\nsubject, quality, or treatment, while in two of them at least it is\r\nevident that the annotator knew nothing at all about the book.\r\n\r\nArticles on children's reading are in general either sentimental or\r\nprejudiced, and they are not of direct practical use to the children's\r\nlibrarian. Reading such articles, however, is interesting and often\r\nsuggestive. Their best feature is the hints they now and then give of\r\nsome book or class of books that has pleased children, and that the\r\nlibrarian does not know or had not thought of.\r\n\r\nTurning to specific points in Miss Hewins' paper, one is inclined to\r\nquestion the stringent criticisms of the \"Pansy\" books, the \"Prudy\"\r\nbooks, \"Editha's burglar,\" and the like stories, that certainly do\r\ndelight many children, though they may not be of a high literary plane.\r\nNor do I believe in children's books carefully \"written down\" to their\r\naudience and never rising above their comprehension.\r\n\"Words-in-one-syllable\" books are obnoxious to a right-minded child. It\r\nis a good thing to be given now and then what is above our\r\ncomprehension. What we don't quite understand holds a strong\r\nfascination. Nor do I believe that the \"horrors\" of the old fairy\r\nstories are particularly harmful--the thrills they impart have a subtle\r\ncharm, and most children delight in \"horrors.\" The difficulty is to\r\nsteer between what is vulgar and coarse or trashily sentimental on the\r\none hand, and the limiting of a children's collection only to\r\n\"pretty-pretty\" stories, innocuous but utterly without character or\r\nvariety, on the other. Such a collection should be made as broad, as\r\nvaried, as catholic as it can be, including old books, English\r\nbooks--Miss Yonge, Miss Shaw, Miss Strickland--not just current and\r\nAmerican books.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the most important thing is to know the books themselves.\r\nThis could not be possible for the librarian of a general collection,\r\nbut it is possible, and ought to be indispensable, for the librarian of\r\na special class of literature. A children's librarian can make herself\r\nfamiliar with the literature suitable for children, and should do so.\r\nPersonal familiarity is better than all \"evaluations\" by other people.\r\nThere should be a constant interchange of criticism and experience among\r\nthose working in this field--it is as yet small enough to permit this.\r\nThis should be largely personal and individual--not brought out as a\r\npublic expression--until there is developed a better basis for critical\r\nand literary discernment in this subject than now exists. The most\r\nimportant thing to do is not to rush hastily into print--to \"educate\r\nourselves in public\"--but to set to work to know our books, and through\r\nsuch knowledge to establish a fund of critical judgment and experience\r\nthat will later make it possible for the utterances of children's\r\nlibrarians to carry weight in their own field of literature.\r\n\r\nThere followed a \"collective paper,\" in three parts, each part being\r\ntreated by a special writer. It dealt with\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BOOKS THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Miss WINIFRED TAYLOR Miss EDNA LYMAN read Miss\r\nTaylor's consideration of\r\n\r\n                              I. FICTION.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 63.)\r\n\r\nMiss LYMAN also read the second paper by Miss ABBY SARGENT, on\r\n\r\n                            II. FAIRY TALES.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 66.)\r\n\r\nThe third paper, in the absence of its author, Miss ELLA HOLMES, was\r\nread by Miss BERTHA M. BROWN. It reviewed\r\n\r\n                       III. SCIENCE FOR CHILDREN.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 69.)\r\n\r\nThe general subject was opened for discussion by F. M. CRUNDEN, who said\r\nthat he thought it was unwise to make a distinction between the reading\r\nof boys and girls, as it tended to differentiate the sexes.\r\n\r\nHe also believed in the reading and rereading of the classics and\r\nstandard literature to children as a means of checking the craving for\r\nnew books which is a characteristic evil of the American adult. The best\r\nmeans of judging the quality of a new book was to set it in comparison\r\nwith an old one that had stood the test of time, so that familiarity\r\nwith, and an ample supply of, the best literature was one of the most\r\neffective ways of raising the standard of taste as regards current\r\nbooks. He also said that the well-brought-up child will usually choose\r\nthe best himself, though wise direction is necessary, for the books he\r\nreads influence his whole life. Reading aloud to children is of great\r\nvalue in bringing them to love books, and too strict a grading of books\r\nby age suitability is inadvisable, as many very young children enjoy\r\nbooks that at first thought seem beyond them. The boy who reads the best\r\nbooks will not choose the worst companions.\r\n\r\nThe program of the meeting was shortened, owing to arrangements of the\r\nlocal entertainment committee, so that the conclusion of the discussion\r\non this subject was carried over to the next session. Before adjournment\r\na nominating committee was appointed, made up of Miss Linda A. Eastman,\r\nMiss Edna Lyman and Mrs. Menzies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _SECOND SESSION._\r\n\r\nThe second session of the section was held on the afternoon of Saturday,\r\nJuly 6. The meeting was called to order at 2.30, when discussion was\r\nresumed of the subject\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BOOKS THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\nMiss W. W. PLUMMER said:\r\n\r\nI should much like to see tried Miss Sargent's plan for the story-hour,\r\n_i. e._, the argument of the story being given first in the attendant's\r\nown words, followed by a reading from some good version of the original,\r\nwith judicious skipping. If this has been tried anywhere, we should be\r\nglad to know of it. We have given as a problem to our class of\r\nchildren's librarians the selection of one or two books of Homer, of the\r\nOdyssey preferably, to cut and edit for reading by or to children, and\r\nhave always found that what was left made an exceedingly interesting\r\nstory, that it seemed might be read just as it was. But, of course, such\r\nan exercise would require an unusually good and very intelligent reader\r\nto be a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Fairy tales._\r\n\r\nBelief, on the part of the author, at least while writing, is necessary\r\nif one would preserve the true atmosphere of the fairy story and\r\ncommunicate the right enjoyment to the child-readers. The fairy book in\r\nwhich the author tries to be \"smart\" and is continually thrusting in his\r\nown personality, is a failure. He must forget himself, leave the present\r\ncentury, and for the time be as credulous as the child himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Fiction._\r\n\r\nThe vulgarization of the child is one of the dangers we must avoid. What\r\nif the boy's father does read the _New York Journal_ and the girl's\r\nmother, when she reads anything, Laura Jean Libbey? It is our business,\r\nas librarians for children, to see that by the time the child reaches\r\nthe same age he shall like something different and better. And how can\r\nthis be brought about if we let him steep himself in the smart,\r\nsensational, vulgar and up-to-date children's books that naturally lead\r\nto just such tastes in the adult?\r\n\r\nWe must also guard against false reasoning. Some authors whom we have\r\nprobably never questioned will have to go, if thus examined. I am\r\nthinking, for instance, of a writer for girls who has been generally\r\naccepted. I examined her last book, the story of a little girl and her\r\ngrandmother, apparently plain people, who moved into a summer village\r\nalongside of a family of fashionable city people. The question with the\r\nchildren of the fashionable family and their friends was whether they\r\nshould or should not make a friend of the new girl--she was nice, but\r\nevidently not rich, not fashionable, not one of their kind. The counsel\r\nof the minority prevailed, and the children, boys and girls of 15 or 16,\r\nkindly admitted her to their circle, though not considering her their\r\nequal. How they held their breath at thought of their nearness to a\r\ngreat mistake when they found she belonged to a fine old family of\r\nanother city, and had great expectations from the quiet grandmother!\r\n\"See how it paid to be polite!\" is the tacit morality of the book, which\r\nis full of the spirit of snobbery while professing to teach the\r\nopposite. It behooves us, therefore, to dip into books before purchasing\r\nor recommending. Nothing will take the place of knowing the books we\r\nhandle and having our own opinion of them.\r\n\r\nA thing we have to look out for is the intentional or unintentional\r\nimitation of the names of well-received writers, _e.g._, the Marie\r\nLouise Pool, author of \"Chums,\" to whom Miss Taylor refers, is not the\r\nMiss Pool who wrote \"Roweny in Boston\" and \"Mrs. Keats Bradford,\" that\r\nauthor having died two or three years ago. The person who uses the same\r\nname, rightfully or wrongfully, writes very different and very inferior\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nAt the information desk we have made lists for various classes and types\r\nof person--but very often have had to lay these aside and make a special\r\nselection for the individual, after talking with him or her. This is as\r\ntrue for children as for adults--the books that appeal to one person do\r\nnot appeal to another of seemingly the same type. Until the proper\r\nrelation be established between the child and the librarian, he cannot\r\nbe influenced very much in his choice of books. Sometimes this relation\r\nmay be established in five minutes, sometimes in a week, a month, or a\r\nyear; sometimes it seems impossible to do it, and some other personal\r\ninfluence must be waited for.\r\n\r\nPeople sometimes say that the children's own tastes in reading should be\r\nour guide. This is true thus far: that if a child is reading books that\r\ndo not seem good for him in our judgment, we should find out what it is\r\n_in_ these books that appeals to him; then look for the same thing in\r\nbooks that are better written and lack the objectionable features, and\r\nboth librarian and child are satisfied. Children learn a great deal by\r\nabsorption, and if the children's librarian can give them the sort of\r\nplot or incident they want and, at the same time, a book from which they\r\nmay absorb good English instead of bad, high ideals and a high code of\r\nbehavior instead of low ones, she has accomplished a great part of her\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Science._\r\n\r\nWith regard to nature books for children, I am glad that Miss Holmes has\r\nspoken frankly and pointed out to us the dangers we incur in rushing\r\ninto the purchase of a new kind of book without investigation. The\r\ntaking up of nature study and the study of art in the public schools has\r\nmeant a great pressure upon libraries for books which teachers and\r\npupils have heard of, but of the merits of which many of them as well as\r\nourselves are unable to judge. In order to have books enough to meet the\r\ndemand, our temptation is to buy entire series, every book we hear of in\r\nthese lines, whereas our best plan would be to get them for inspection\r\nonly, invite the inspection and criticism of some scientific person, or\r\nsome one conversant with art and its literature, and reject what they\r\ncondemn, putting in duplicates enough of the approved books to meet the\r\nlarge demand. A thing we need to beware of is the stampede--the wild\r\nrush to or away from a thing without reasoning, without stopping to\r\nthink, just because other libraries we know of are engaging in it. The\r\nlibrarian needs at such times to keep cool, brace himself or herself\r\nagainst the rush, and when the dust of the crowd is over think things\r\nout and go ahead. And in these lines where special knowledge is\r\nnecessary do not let us think ourselves infallible or even altogether\r\ncompetent; let us be humble enough to take advice and information from\r\nthose who have a real claim to know.\r\n\r\nJ. C. DANA said:\r\n\r\nThe papers we have heard read tell us that we can put no dependence on\r\nbook reviews; that the librarian must depend on herself. How can she do\r\nit? There are no laws or rules or principles of book selection. Even if\r\nthere were, no librarian has time to read even hastily all the books for\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIf she wishes to evaluate them in the light of any possible principles\r\nshe may have laid down, she finds the principles themselves very shaky.\r\nExperience is our only guide. A friend of mine much interested in\r\npsychology, and especially in the psychology of young people, and\r\nespecially, again, in the influence on young people of the books read\r\nduring the years 12 to 16, tells me that as a result of considerable\r\nstudy of nickel-libraries and news-stand story papers of what we call a\r\npoor kind, he thinks this literature is generally harmless; is perhaps\r\neven helpful; is well above the intelligence of most of those who read\r\nit; and is largely written by men and women who seriously wish to help\r\nto bring light and joy into the world. If our general opinion about\r\nthese nickel-libraries is to be given a shock such as that, what may we\r\nnot expect as to other classes of books, of our judgment on which at\r\npresent we are quite as sure? It is distressing, the amount of work that\r\nis being done in this country nowadays even by the librarians themselves\r\nin their attempt, each by herself alone, to come to sound conclusions in\r\nregard to the value of books for children. We don't care to read these\r\nbooks. We read them when we are weary, we read too many of them. Our own\r\ntaste, if originally good, gets perverted; our point of view gets\r\nprejudiced; and our opinions are of very little value when formed. Why\r\nnot try co-operation? I suggest that you appoint a committee to\r\nformulate some scheme for securing the beginning of an evaluated list of\r\nchildren's books; and that this committee see that at least a portion of\r\nthe scheme, enough to show us another year how it can be successfully\r\ncarried on, be completed before our next annual meeting. I would\r\nsuggest, for example, that this committee, in the first place, collect\r\nfrom members of the Association sufficient money in voluntary\r\nsubscriptions to pay for postage, clerical work and printing, in\r\nbeginning the evaluated list; that they then appoint some person to set\r\nin motion the machinery necessary for getting together a set of\r\nevaluations. She would perhaps begin by selecting almost at random 500\r\nstory books for young people of the ages 10 to 14. This list she would\r\nsubmit, in whole or in small sections, to as many active librarians who\r\nare interested in children's literature, as she could get into\r\ncommunication with. Having secured from them opinions, she would\r\ntabulate the results of the reading of each book and compile from these\r\nopinions a brief note. She would, perhaps, submit to us at the end of\r\nthe year a brief list, in type, with or without annotations, of story\r\nbooks for children that are not good, another brief list of story books\r\nfor children that are good. Without going further into detail I think\r\nyou will see that in some such way as this, we can make the reading we\r\nnow do along these lines permanently helpful to one another. We can\r\nperhaps in two or three years produce a foundation list of books for\r\nyoung people on which we can depend; we can then continue the evaluating\r\nprocess for other books as they appear from year to year.\r\n\r\nH. C. WELLMAN directed attention to the economy which would result from\r\na printed list of juvenile books to be prepared and issued by the\r\nSection of Children's Librarians and used as a catalog of the juvenile\r\ncollections in public libraries. Such a list should not only embody the\r\njoint opinion of the best authorities, but should effect a saving of 90\r\nper cent. in the work of preparing and the cost of printing separate\r\nlists for each library. The joint lists, containing 500 or more titles,\r\ncould be set up with slugs, and revised and brought down to date in\r\nfrequent editions. Some simple notation could be adopted, and the\r\njuvenile books in each library numbered to correspond. Then the list\r\ncould be purchased in quantities by the libraries and sold to their\r\nborrowers at a cent apiece. The result would place within the reach of\r\neven small libraries a juvenile list at an exceedingly low price, always\r\nup-to-date, and of a quality and authority which should make it superior\r\nto any similar lists ever issued.\r\n\r\nA motion was made by Mr. PERRY that a committee of three be appointed to\r\ntake action on Mr. Dana's suggestion. The motion was carried and a\r\nspecial committee consisting of Mr. Dana, Mr. Perry and Miss Browning\r\nwas appointed by the chair to act upon the suggestion at some general\r\nmeeting of the Association.[H]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Miss H. H. STANLEY Mr. WELLMAN read Miss Stanley's\r\npaper on\r\n\r\n                      REFERENCE WORK FOR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 74.)\r\n\r\nMr. WELLMAN then discussed the question of whether the bulk of reference\r\nwork with children should be carried on in the schools or at the\r\nlibrary, and urged the claims of the library. The ultimate aim of\r\nreference work with children is to teach them to use the library during\r\nschool life and after for purposes of study and self-education. To\r\naccomplish this end no person is so competent as the librarian and no\r\nplace so appropriate as the library.\r\n\r\nMiss LINDA A. EASTMAN said:\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley's excellent report appears to furnish just the sort of\r\nbasis for a discussion of one of the most vital questions in relation to\r\nthe work with children, such a discussion as may lead to a much-needed\r\ndefinition of principles in regard to this side of the work.\r\n\r\nA word or two about special topics mentioned--under library facilities.\r\nIn addition to the books for reference mentioned by Miss Stanley, there\r\nis one which may not yet have come to the attention of all children's\r\nlibrarians because it is but just published--the new \"Index to _St.\r\nNicholas_,\" published with the consent of the Century Company by the\r\nCumulative Index Co. It has its imperfections, but it certainly should\r\nprove a useful reference tool for every children's librarian, and the\r\nbest simple stepping-stone yet furnished to the use of Poole and the\r\nother indexes.\r\n\r\nNow, for the general subject, Miss Stanley says, \"I think we are agreed\r\nthat for the children our aim reaches to a familiarity with reference\r\ntools, to knowing how to hunt down a subject, to being able to use to\r\nbest advantage the material found. In a word, we are concerned not so\r\nmuch to supply information as to educate in the use of the library.\"\r\n\r\nThe aim is well stated, and we are agreed in it, I believe, but are we\r\nagreed as to, and have we given sufficient thought to, the methods by\r\nwhich this desirable aim is to be accomplished? Where, in that ideal\r\nultimate of co-operation between schools and libraries toward which we\r\nare striving, will the necessary instruction be given, in the schools or\r\nin the library? Or, if in both, where will the division of labor be\r\nplaced? I, myself, am inclined to think that the formal, systematic\r\ninstruction in the use of books should be given in the schools, with\r\nsympathetic, systematic help on the part of the library. Is it not\r\npossible that we, as librarians, seeing the need, are over-anxious to do\r\nthe whole work, or at least feel sometimes that we can do the whole work\r\nmore easily and better than we can get the overworked teachers to do\r\nit--though a large part of the work really belongs to them.\r\n\r\nMore than in any other work with the children, this reference work\r\nrequires that we go back of the children and begin with the\r\nteachers--no, not with the teachers, but with the teachers in\r\nembryo--the students in the normal schools.\r\n\r\nMiss ALICE TYLER, who followed, said that it was of the greatest\r\nimportance to teach children the use of the catalog, which should be\r\nmade to suit the mental capacity of children, using terms with which\r\nthey are familiar.\r\n\r\nIn Cleveland the children's catalog was made upon these lines, using\r\nsimple subject headings based on headings used by Miss Prentice in her\r\n\"Third grade list\" and the Pratt Institute lists.\r\n\r\nTeaching children in the children's room how to use the catalog is the\r\nonly way to make the future men and women more independent readers in\r\nthe public library.\r\n\r\nMr. HENSEL closed the discussion with a short account of the reference\r\nwork done in the Columbus public schools.\r\n\r\nA paper by Miss CLARA W. HUNT was read on\r\n\r\n                       OPENING A CHILDREN'S ROOM.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 83.)\r\n\r\nThe discussion was opened by HENRY J. CARR, who said:\r\n\r\nI cannot say why I was selected to discuss Miss Hunt's paper, unless\r\nbecause I was known to her and somewhat familiar with her work and the\r\nparticular children's room fitted up under her direction in the new\r\nbuilding of the Newark Free Public Library.\r\n\r\nI am so much in sympathy with Miss Hunt's views as expressed in the\r\npaper, and regard them as so correct that I can do little but emphasize\r\nthe points she has brought out. She has been eminently wise in\r\npresenting for consideration some of the proper guiding principles of\r\nthe children's room, something that is too often lost sight of in the\r\nattitude taken by those responsible for their establishment and\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nWe should not look upon the children's room as a \"kindergarten,\" or\r\nplayground for the younger children, so much as a stepping-stone to tide\r\nthem along to the reading of books adapted to more mature minds, and\r\nhence to \"graduate\" them out of it as fast as possible. It has also a\r\npurpose, which is a further reason for retaining in this room, more or\r\nless, an aspect similar to that of the adults' rooms. Parents to some\r\nextent come to select reading matter for their children, and those of\r\nmature years but immature minds may drift into this department, if it is\r\nnot made too juvenile in tone and appearance. Hence, I prefer the name\r\nYoung People's Library to that of Children's Room. I have seen boys\r\nstand aloof at first for fear of ridicule for going into the room \"for\r\nkids.\" I prefer to have the discharging of books done at one main desk,\r\nas it keeps the children in touch with adults and gives all ages more\r\nfreedom in drawing from all departments. Hence we have no special\r\njuvenile cards. I should advise to include on the children's shelves\r\ngood books for older readers; to avoid sets or the writings of\r\nvoluminous authors, as a rule; and to aim to seek the writers of those\r\ngood books that are apt to be overlooked. Discipline and good order\r\nshould be maintained at the outset, and after that the children should\r\nbe let alone, so far as possible. They like to have a chance to inform\r\none another; those becoming first familiar with the room and its methods\r\nwill only too gladly induct newcomers into its operation.\r\n\r\nMrs. M. A. SANDERS said:\r\n\r\nThe librarian from Newark speaks from experience, for hers is an ideal\r\nchildren's room, both in equipment and administration. At the dedication\r\nof the library the interest centered largely around that department. Her\r\ninterest in the children and their work, so ably expressed, carried me\r\nback to the early 80's, when, as some of us remember, scarcely a round\r\ndozen libraries could be found where children were admitted. On one side\r\nof the door we saw a placard reading, \"Children not admitted under 14\r\nyears\"; on the other, \"Dogs not allowed.\" A strong appeal was made at\r\nthat time at the Thousand Island meeting for children's rights in the\r\npublic library by a librarian who was making a specialty of work with\r\nchildren, and admitted them without an age limit. Glorious has been the\r\nresponse, for the library that makes no provision for the children\r\nto-day is the exception.\r\n\r\nAt Pawtucket we open our children's rooms and bid them welcome, we open\r\nour shelves, and their judgment in the selection of books often equals\r\nour own. We decorate the walls with pictures that appeal to the\r\naffections, we send them into the homes, and by and by we see an entire\r\nfamily gathered around the table deeply interested in the pictures and\r\nthe description of them as they read from the books brought home by the\r\nchildren. We put in our cases of birds, which the children delight to\r\nstudy, and soon a mother says to us, \"I never thought much about the\r\nbirds till the children began to talk about them, but we have been out\r\nevery morning listening for the new calls as the birds appear in the\r\nspring.\" In these and various other ways we see the influence of the\r\nchildren's room, which is broadening every day.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, many a library where the children's room has not yet\r\nmaterialized, either from lack of space or funds, that is exerting a\r\npowerful influence through its children, and I question sometimes\r\nwhether it may not be a mistake to draw too sharp a line of separation.\r\nWhere should we draw our line? At just what age do girls and boys cease\r\nto be children? That has been for me a serious question; I wonder if you\r\nhave escaped it, and if the children's room solves it.\r\n\r\nI am in hearty sympathy with the opinion expressed that \"the management\r\nand spirit of the children's room should correspond to that of other\r\ndepartments of the library.\" There seems to be a tendency to make these\r\nrooms a play-room--the children coming to be amused, and the time of one\r\nperson devoted to their amusement. If this is the design of the\r\nchildren's room, our own young people at Pawtucket will be sadly\r\ndisappointed. While we will put in the pictures, the birds, the plants,\r\nthe busts and all else to make the room interesting, and while we will\r\nhave frequent talks in the lecture room, the children being quietly led\r\non to express themselves freely, the quiet dignity of the children's\r\nlibrary room as an important part of the library will be maintained. The\r\nbooks will also be charged at the main charging desk for them, as we\r\nfeel that this bringing of the adult and the child into close contact is\r\nof mutual benefit.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the children's department has never been a serious\r\nquestion to us. Give them a very few brief rules, and enforce them, and\r\nwe shall have no great troubles to contend with; the children will\r\nvirtually take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe question is asked us, \"For what does the children's room stand, what\r\nis its real purpose?\" It is evident that it has a different purpose in\r\ndifferent libraries. To us the children's library room is for reading,\r\nfor study, for observation, for questioning undisturbed and\r\nundisturbing, while the entire library is still at the service of any\r\nchild who desires to make practical use of it.\r\n\r\nMiss CHARLOTTE WALLACE read a paper on\r\n\r\n                      BULLETIN WORK FOR CHILDREN.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 72.)\r\n\r\nTwo papers were read on\r\n\r\n     VITALIZING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE LIBRARY,\r\n\r\nMiss MAY L. PRENTICE treating\r\n\r\n                              THE SCHOOL.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 78.)\r\n\r\nMiss IRENE WARREN presenting the side of\r\n\r\n                              THE LIBRARY.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 81.)\r\n\r\nOwing to the lateness of the hour discussion of the last topics had to\r\nbe passed over.\r\n\r\nThe chairman then called for the\r\n\r\n\r\n                  REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON NOMINATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe committee on nominations wishes to submit the following names: For\r\npresident, Miss Annie Carroll Moore; for secretary, Miss Mary E.\r\nDousman.\r\n\r\nIn suggesting the continuance of the present officers the committee does\r\nnot wish to establish a precedent, but there seems to be special fitness\r\nand justice in asking Miss Moore and Miss Dousman to serve the section\r\nfor another year. To their earnest effort this section of children's\r\nlibrarians is largely due; these well-balanced programs are a result of\r\ntheir careful planning. The section can hardly be put in safer hands for\r\nits second year.\r\n\r\nThe officers named in the committee report were unanimously elected.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: This report is from notes furnished by Miss Mary E.\r\nDousman, secretary of the section.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: For report of this committee and action of Association\r\n_see_ Proceedings, p. 130.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE LIBRARY COMMISSIONS AND TRAVELLING LIBRARIES: ROUND TABLE MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn informal \"round table\" meeting for the consideration of the work of\r\nstate library commissions, including travelling libraries, was held in\r\nthe assembly room of the Fountain House on Tuesday afternoon, July 9.\r\nThe chairman, MELVIL DEWEY, called the meeting to order at three\r\no'clock, and in a few introductory remarks outlined the subjects to be\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: We have on our program this afternoon two of the most\r\ninteresting things in library work. The travelling library is reaching\r\nout in its manifold forms with wonderful rapidity and gives very great\r\npromise of usefulness for the future; organized work under the state\r\ncommissions is showing every year better and better results and\r\nindicating that just as our schools increased their efficiency so\r\nimmensely by having state departments to look after them, we are\r\nrepeating the history of that evolution in our state library\r\ncommissions. We have only a single session this afternoon to discuss\r\nthese two subjects. If we were to give them one quarter of the time that\r\nthey ought to have, we would not get one quarter through, and I propose\r\ntherefore to deal only with questions and answers, and utilize one\r\nanother's experience or thought along these lines of state commission\r\nwork and work of administering travelling libraries.\r\n\r\nI have noted down some of the topics that have been given to me by\r\npersons who wanted to have them discussed briefly; we will first take up\r\nsome of these. So much has been done in travelling libraries, that\r\nperhaps we should clear the floor of that subject, and then consider the\r\nwork of the state commissions--and in that I mean all the work done by\r\nthe state in its official capacity--chartering libraries, library\r\nlegislation, inspection, travelling libraries--whatever the state may do\r\nfor public libraries.\r\n\r\nThe first topic is, \"What is the best method of getting travelling\r\nlibraries before the people?\" Who has any experience or suggestion to\r\noffer on that point--either of difficulties or successes?\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: Go to the pastors and school houses.\r\n\r\nMr. HOSTETTER: Does the gentleman mean to put the travelling libraries\r\ninto school houses? Last Sunday I visited a man who had never heard of\r\nsuch a thing as travelling libraries; he was a German pastor; and\r\nprobably that accounted for it.\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: Is there not objection to having travelling libraries in\r\nschool houses, for the reason that so many of the hours during which the\r\nchildren have leisure to read, and their parents could read, the school\r\nhouses are closed? Another difficulty is the long summer vacation; and\r\nstill another is that to place the library in the school house makes the\r\ntravelling library merely a side issue.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Where would you put it?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: Find somebody to take it in special charge. A travelling\r\nlibrary in a community is bound to find some good woman who would rather\r\nhave charge of it than anything else in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Then you would put it in a private house?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: In a private house or a country post-office--wherever you\r\ncan find a person who believes in its use and will give service for it.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: I should like to ask Mr. Hutchins, provided the teacher\r\nis a man or woman who believes in the library, what objection is there\r\nto placing it in the school house?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: The teacher may be a person who believes in it, but he or\r\nshe makes the school of first importance.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: What difference does it make if the library is a side\r\nissue, so long as it gets in its work?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: If it is a side issue it does not get in its work.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: Let us go back to the original question, How to get the\r\ntravelling library before the people. The best method, we find, is to\r\ntake with you a county superintendent who is acquainted with all the\r\npeople in his county, or ought to be. Take your travelling library with\r\nyou also, just as a travelling man takes his samples. Do not start out\r\nwith a lot of circulars; take the books themselves right with you, in\r\nthe back of the wagon. When you have brought the people together open\r\nyour box; take out your _Scribner_ or your _Youth's Companion_; take out\r\nyour books on the Philippines, on birds, on cookery; show your audience\r\nsome good stories; and you will organize a library association ten times\r\nquicker than if you had started out by writing letters. Those are\r\nletters, very often, that are never answered, and you wait and wonder\r\nwhy the people do not want the books. Go to the people with the books.\r\nThat is the way we find we can work best in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: Sometimes it is difficult to find the means to do the\r\nwork that Miss Stearns has mentioned, and possibly our experience,\r\nbriefly stated, in bringing the travelling library to the attention of\r\nthe people of Ohio might not be out of place here. We began by\r\nadvertising it through the daily and weekly papers. That brought us very\r\nfew responses. We next tried to reach the people through the official\r\norgan of the teachers of the state. That brought us many responses from\r\nrural schools. Our next effort was to reach the farming communities\r\nthrough the state grange, which devoted one of its quarterly bulletins\r\nto the travelling libraries. This brought many responses. We reached the\r\nwomen's clubs through circulars issued to their membership, and this was\r\nvery effective in turn. We found it best to reach the people of the\r\nstate through the organs that were devoted to specific interests,\r\nespecially along educational lines.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Did you go personally to the grangers, write to them, or send\r\nprinted matter?\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: We saw the lecturer of the grange, who issues a quarterly\r\nbulletin in our state. We explained the system fully to him, and he\r\ndevoted almost an entire bulletin to an explanation of the system, and\r\nadvised the farmers of the state to patronize the travelling libraries.\r\nThen we have published in Ohio the _Ohio Farmer_, which circulates\r\nwidely outside of the state. That took up the work and helped us\r\ngreatly. We reached the farmers by going to the public press and using\r\nthe organs that the farmers read. We reached the teachers in the same\r\nway, and the women's clubs. We have advertised our system pretty widely\r\nover the state, so that now we do not send circulars except when they\r\nare requested. We are circulating about one thousand travelling\r\nlibraries in Ohio, and they go to all parts of the state. Not only that,\r\nbut we have travelling library systems in three counties of the state\r\nthat are in no way dependent upon the state for support and that are\r\ndoing excellent work.\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: Do the people pay anything for the libraries?\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: They pay transportation both ways, and that is all.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: Do they always have to pay it?\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: If you found a community too poor to pay, what would you\r\ndo?\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: We have not so far met that condition. Perhaps some\r\nlibraries have not been sent out because the people were too poor to pay\r\nthe charge, but if that problem does come up before us, we will try to\r\nfind some person who will pay the transportation.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Are there no remarks to be made on the use of annotated\r\nfinding lists in travelling library work?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: Annotations are worth a great deal, because the people, at\r\ntheir homes, sit down and talk over the books in these lists, and they\r\nget acquainted with the books and the authors.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: The best form of annotation, I take it, would be the brief\r\nnote, giving the best idea possible of the character of the book, and\r\ntelling the reader whether he wants to read it or not, not necessarily\r\nas a matter of quotation from some one else.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: It is always a good plan to put in the publisher and price\r\nof the book; if the person gets interested in the book he can find out\r\nhow much it would cost and where he can get it.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: It would be well also to put in the number of pages, so\r\nthat people know how large a volume it is--150, 250, or 350 pages.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Has any one else tried the use of a wagon, as described by\r\nMiss Stearns--going right to the people and reaching the homes? That\r\nmeans going out into the rural districts and dealing with the farmhouses\r\nas individual homes. There must be the right person in the wagon, of\r\ncourse, who can stand and speak for an hour perhaps and leave half a\r\ndozen or a dozen books to start the work along.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: That is the only way in the world by which you can find\r\nwhat the people like to read--it is only by visiting the people, getting\r\nacquainted with them, going right into their homes. The idea of sending\r\na box of books off in a freight car, not knowing anything about the\r\ncountry or the people it is going to! If you want those books to do good\r\nwork, you must know where they are going.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: That is the way men sell goods. The librarian is just as\r\nanxious to place his books to advantage as the merchant is to sell his\r\nwares. If he is dealing with the rural community he follows just that\r\nmethod. I am inclined to think that somebody is going to make a great\r\nsuccess with those wagons.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: Where the demand for books is strong, as it is in Ohio,\r\nand you have all that you can do to supply that demand, should not that\r\nbe attended to before you go out in a wagon to enlarge your field?\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Oh, yes; but in Ohio everybody expects to be President sooner\r\nor later.\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: Isn't the point this: Where you only supply a demand you\r\nreach the intelligent communities first and the neglected communities\r\nare left out; but the libraries should reach the neglected communities.\r\nWe spend too much money in buying books and not enough in educating the\r\npeople to use the books. It is the same old story. You spend $10,000 for\r\nbooks and not $200 for administration, and the administration is the\r\nimportant point.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: There is another analogy. We used to have the schools only\r\nfor the bright boys. It is a modern idea to give education to the dull,\r\nthe backward, the blind and the deaf, but nowadays they are all being\r\ntrained. And we keep finding men who are among the strongest citizens of\r\ntheir age, but who, if we get at their early history, we find were once\r\ndull, backward boys that somebody hunted up and started along the right\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: What communities, as a rule, are first served in\r\nWisconsin?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: The neglected communities. The community in which we are\r\nmeeting is in the wealthiest part of the state of Wisconsin. We have not\r\ngot a travelling library near here. We have only 300 of these libraries,\r\nand we seek out the neglected communities; not because we do not care to\r\nhelp the people here, but we must take the neglected ones first.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: This is a practical question. It may be that after a\r\nwhile we will all be seeking the neglected communities. What is the\r\npractical method of going out into the state after the neglected\r\ncommunities? How are you going to do it?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: That is where you have got to have missionary work,\r\npersonal contact.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: It is not a question of studying what to do; it is a case of\r\nthe man behind the idea. If a man starts out who is a born missionary,\r\nhe will go straight to the communities who need him, while another man\r\nwill take care of another class. We want to do all the work before us,\r\nbut if we are so situated that we cannot do both kinds of work in this\r\nfield, which is the more important to do first, cultivate the good field\r\nor the poor field, which if you do not cultivate it will run to weeds\r\nand escape us entirely? As Mr. Galbreath asks, if a community is anxious\r\nto read, will you supply that, or will you stir somebody up that does\r\nnot want your supplies? In other words, if there is a field that is\r\nrather poor, will you cultivate that at the expense of another field\r\nthat yields a good crop?\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: It seems to me that a neglected community is one that has\r\nno library of any kind of its own; nine-tenths of our travelling\r\nlibraries go out to communities of that sort.\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: I would not take that as a definition. In an intelligent\r\ncommunity they buy books, they buy magazines, they have intelligent\r\npeople. A neglected community is one that is not reached by these means,\r\nor by any means of civilization.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: Suppose I go into a community which all the American\r\npeople are gradually leaving, only foreigners remaining. How can I reach\r\nthe foreign people that hardly have the English language in their homes,\r\nand scarcely in the schools?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: Take, for instance, one of those foreign communities. The\r\nchildren go to school; some of them stay in school until they can barely\r\nspell out the third reader, and then they go out and become American\r\ncitizens. Reading is hard work for them. You offer them a chance to read\r\na book, and they do not want it. But in that place we send first with\r\nour travelling libraries the _Youth's Companion_ and the little picture\r\npapers, to interest them in spelling out little short stories. Try\r\nelementary books; simple books of American history and biography; lead\r\nthem on to better books. But the way is, first of all, to go to them. We\r\nhave many such communities in the northern part of the state, where the\r\npeople have come from foreign lands and know nothing about our customs.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: Another question. I would ask Mr. Hutchins, if a farming\r\ncommunity should send to the state commission for a travelling library,\r\nand with the request state that they had no library to which they had\r\naccess, if he would decline to send to them because they were an\r\nintelligent community?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: No, we send libraries to these communities. We are sending\r\nto all classes, but if Miss Stearns, in the northern part of the state,\r\nfinds a neglected community, and can work with them, and can find some\r\nmembers of the women's clubs to go out and help, we send to them first.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: I think that perhaps our methods do not vary so much\r\nafter all. The women's clubs are supplementing our work in that way. In\r\nOhio we have succeeded in interesting a number of the members of the\r\nlegislature, and frequently they come in and look over our maps\r\nillustrating the travelling library work, and say, \"There is in our\r\ncounty a community that is very backward. They have no libraries there,\r\nand they are not very intelligent. I wish you to write to So-and-so in\r\nthat community.\" We do a great deal of work in the line of reaching what\r\nMr. Hutchins calls the neglected communities.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: I would like to ask Mr. Hutchins if he has forgotten that we\r\nhave something besides the readers in our Wisconsin schools? Under the\r\npresent school law every district in the state has the beginnings of a\r\nlibrary, and adds to that library each year. And we have in each of our\r\nschool institutes held during the summer a 45-minute period which is\r\nspent in training teachers how to get children to read books, how to\r\ninterest them in the books, and how to show them to get from the book\r\nthe information it contains. And I would also like to ask if the library\r\nplaced in the school house is not as accessible to the district as a\r\nlibrary that may be placed at some central point? Very often people\r\nwould have to drive 25 or 30 miles to reach that central point, whereas\r\nin the library in the school house the children can take the books to\r\ntheir homes. During the long vacation the library need not be left in\r\nthe school house, but in some other place.\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: A library in a school is a school library, no matter where\r\nit may be, and the children do not go to the school house after they\r\nleave the school.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: The library is an optional affair; the children are compelled\r\nto go to school. On the other side, there are a number of advantages in\r\nfavor of the school building.\r\n\r\nHas anybody succeeded in getting from the railroads or express companies\r\nspecial concessions for the transportation of library books?\r\n\r\nMrs. DOCKERY: In Idaho, while the travelling libraries were in the hands\r\nof the women's clubs. When they came in the hands of the state, the\r\nrailroads felt that they should have some compensation, and they gave us\r\nhalf rates. The stage lines give us less than half rates.\r\n\r\nE. H. ANDERSON: In Pennsylvania the Adams and the United States Express\r\nCompanies, which are the two leading companies, have made this\r\nconcession: We can send out books at full rate going, and half rate\r\nreturning. These rates apply only on condition that the books returned\r\nare paid for at the library, so there is no confusion at any other\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nMr. MONTGOMERY: How about books that are transferred to another point?\r\n\r\nMr. ANDERSON: We do not transfer them; they must all come back.\r\n\r\nG. F. BOWERMAN: The law of Delaware requires that the express companies\r\nshall give the franking privilege, both coming and going, to all state\r\ndocuments, and we intend, if possible, to extend that provision to our\r\ntravelling libraries, now that they are conducted by a state commission.\r\n\r\nMr. HOSTETTER: On the question of express, my experience in Illinois is\r\nthat the shipping of our books has been unsatisfactory, and I have had\r\nsome conversation in the matter with the express companies. They seem\r\nwilling to give us some concessions, and I believe if this meeting would\r\nrecommend that the American Library Association take up the question of\r\nexpress charges, that we could get for the whole United States a liberal\r\nconcession for travelling libraries. At least I think we could get as\r\nmuch concession as is given the farmers for returning chicken coops. I\r\nthink if this is taken up by the Association, as an association, we\r\ncould get a very liberal reduction.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERMAN: The Seaboard Air Line runs a free travelling library\r\nsystem, and I presume they send their books over that system free?\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Yes. They also pay expenses, but would they open those\r\nprivileges to other people?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: I want to raise one question. Isn't it a mistake to put the\r\nlibrary in the position of a beggar? Is it not better to pay for what we\r\nget?\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: If we have money enough. We would rather beg than have no\r\nbread. We are willing to profit by whatever concession we can get which\r\nwill enable us to do our work.\r\n\r\nNo one has spoken of the most important thing of all in this work. We\r\nare reaching communities, but there are in all our states great numbers\r\nof isolated homes and of farmers. They have more leisure than any other\r\nclass, especially in the winter, and we have to reach them through the\r\nmails. We have a letter from Mr. Lane, of Harvard, upon the movement to\r\nsecure reduced postal rates for library books, undertaken through the\r\nNew England Education League by Mr. Scott. This matter is of great\r\nimportance to us all. [Mr. Lane's letter was read by Mr. Bowerman.]\r\n\r\nMr. MONTGOMERY: In connection with that, has any one here tried to send\r\nsingle books to individuals in any of the communities through the rural\r\ndelivery system?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: We have to a certain extent. We have not sufficient funds\r\nto send out enough of the boxes, so we allow a school teacher in the\r\nnorthern part of the state to draw out some book on some subject, and we\r\nsend these by the rural delivery, or by mail, whichever will reach him\r\nmost quickly, but of course we have to pay the regular postage.\r\n\r\nMr. HOSTETTER: We have sent out a few books to the country domestic\r\nscience clubs through the mails, and we have a greater demand for them\r\nthan we could ever supply. Now I find this experience: the express\r\ncompanies, in the matter of books, would carry a book more cheaply than\r\nthe United States mail. I am quite confident that the express companies\r\nwould return the books free, or at a very low rate, if the charges were\r\nprepaid. I move that this meeting recommend that the American Library\r\nAssociation take up the question of procuring reduced transportation\r\nrates for all free circulating library books.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: If this large meeting is practically agreed on the importance\r\nof that, we could send the recommendation into the Council meeting\r\nto-night. It seems to me simply inconceivable that we are willing to\r\nallow periodicals, bad and indifferent, and the yellow journals, to\r\nreceive the pound postal rate, while our libraries, suffering from lack\r\nof income and working for the public benefit, cannot use the public\r\nfacilities as cheaply as the people who are using them for public harm\r\ninstead of public good. I had supposed there would be unanimous approval\r\nof an act to register public libraries, owned and maintained for the\r\npublic benefit, so that they could receive the pound postal rate on\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nMr. HOSTETTER'S motion was seconded.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Let us see if there is anything more on this question before\r\nthe motion is put. There is a bill closely allied to this going into the\r\nnext Congress. Mr. Hutchins, will you state it briefly?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: We have twice tried to secure better transportation in the\r\nstate of Wisconsin. We have found rural mail carriers who said that they\r\nwould carry books to the farmers for a travelling library without cost,\r\nbut the United States law said that we could not do this; that we cannot\r\ncarry in this way anything under four pounds in weight except it is\r\nstamped. Congressman Jenkins, therefore, has drawn a bill which gives\r\nlibraries authority to send their books free along rural mail routes. At\r\npresent the farmer must either carry the book himself and return it to\r\nthe public library, or he must pay postage.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: You say that the carriers cannot take packages under four\r\npounds without stamps?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: Yes; the government rules that packages under four pounds\r\nare to be sent by mail. Larger packages we could send by the carriers,\r\nand we have sometimes thought of sending 15 or 20 books to a\r\nneighborhood for distribution. I think that could be done, under the\r\ngovernment rule, if the mail carrier was willing to carry them.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: The idea is, that the carrier must not carry anything to\r\ncompete with the postal service.\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: Mr. Jenkins, who has drawn this bill for us, has submitted\r\nit to all the Senators and Representatives in the United States, and\r\nnearly all favor it. Now, I am in favor of Mr. Scott's bill, which gives\r\nlibraries reduced rates through the whole United States. As things are\r\nto-day, if you want to send a travelling library book 100 miles out into\r\nthe country it costs as much as to send it to San Francisco or New York.\r\nIf we can get the government to allow transportation by rural free mail\r\ndelivery it will be an entering wedge for this other bill.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERMAN: Why cannot the legislation adopting the rural mail\r\ndelivery also include this matter of the pound rates? Why not have both\r\nprovisions in one bill? My library is practically free to the whole of\r\nNewcastle county, not confined simply to Wilmington, but it is a farming\r\ncommunity. We would like to send books to every part of the county,\r\npractically to every part of the state. The library is practically free\r\nto the state of Delaware, so far as people can come to us, but they\r\ncannot come to us; we would like to go to them, but we cannot do it,\r\nbecause of the expense. We could do it if we could afford sufficient\r\npostage to send books.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: These are two closely allied questions. Has any one any\r\nobjection to this Jenkins bill, which, on its face, promises to be so\r\nuseful to us? I think we can get it, if we work together.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: If the government admits library books into this country\r\nfree of duty, why cannot it allow a man to carry a book free on the\r\nrural delivery route if he wants to do it? In our state we have people\r\nwho cannot afford to pay postage on the books; if the mail-carrier is\r\nwilling, in the goodness of his heart, to take the book to them, why\r\ncan't it be done? Why should not a book from a free library be sent\r\nfree? I do not mean from one state to another, but I mean by rural free\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: Would you make it optional with the carrier? Why not make\r\nit compulsory? You say, \"if he wants\" to carry the book. Suppose he does\r\nnot \"want\" to carry it?\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: I would have it so that he can do it for nothing if he\r\nwishes, or he can charge a little for express. The rural mail delivery\r\npeople have to work hard, and they make but little. Now, the United\r\nStates government has to employ good men to do this work, so it puts in\r\na premium by allowing them to conduct an express business in connection\r\nwith it. In order, however, that the government may receive its revenue,\r\nit does not allow the carriers to carry any packages under four pounds\r\nin weight. What we want is to have that embargo removed for free library\r\nbooks, so that they may carry books weighing a pound or a half pound.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: The post-office would probably say that this would\r\ninterfere with the delivery of the regular mail.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: If it interferes, then the whole express business\r\ninterferes. The carriers are doing such a business now for packages\r\nabout four pounds in weight.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Then all you need to do is to attach a brick to your book and\r\nmake it weigh over four pounds. Is there any motion before the meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: The motion of the gentleman from Illinois has not been\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nMr. HOSTETTER: My motion relates to express transportation. Rural\r\ndelivery is somewhat of an experiment, and it would not reach the case I\r\nhave in mind. We spend our money for expressage, and we want the\r\nexpress companies to give us a minimum rate.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: I rule there is no motion before us until it is repeated.\r\n\r\nMr. HUSE: I move that we recommend the passage of the Jenkins bill. We\r\nought to pay no attention to all this talk about lines of least\r\nresistance. If we have no law, we will find the Post-office Department\r\nready with an objection that will answer any request we may make. If we\r\ncan get a law authorizing what we want, the Post-office Department will\r\nobey it whether we seek the line of least resistance or not.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Is the motion seconded?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: I rise to a point of order. There was a previous motion\r\nmade and seconded, and I call for the question.\r\n\r\nMr. HOSTETTER: I made a definite motion in regard to the express\r\ncompanies. It was made for the reason that arrangements can probably be\r\neffected with the express companies, but we are not likely to get the\r\nlegislation we want. This motion was this: That this meeting request the\r\nCouncil of this Association to negotiate with the express companies of\r\nthe United States for reduced rates upon travelling libraries and\r\ntravelling library books.\r\n\r\nThe motion was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. HUSE: I renew my motion that we recommend the passage of the Jenkins\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: The Jenkins bill provides that wherever there is\r\nestablished a public library from which rural delivery routes radiate,\r\nbooks may be carried upon those routes from the public library to the\r\npatrons in the country without cost. They may not, however, be returned\r\nfree; in returning they must either be returned personally to the\r\nlibrary or postage must be paid.\r\n\r\nThe motion made by Mr. Huse was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: We come now to the question of pound rates. That has been\r\nbefore Congress for some time, and I think there is hope of its passage;\r\nbut it needs our support. I am heartily in favor of it. I think it is\r\njust, and that a great deal of the criticism it has received is based on\r\nmisapprehension. Some people look only at the rates that extend\r\nthroughout the country, and say that the government will be carrying\r\nbooks at a loss, but these books will largely circulate within 100 miles\r\nof the library, and you will pay exactly the same rate within that\r\ncircuit as you would if sending to San Francisco. Does anybody want to\r\nmove that the Council be asked to support this bill?\r\n\r\nIt was moved and seconded that the support of the bill be recommended.\r\n\r\nMr. HUSE: It seems to me we are trying to get a good many things. If we\r\nget the cheap postal rates, that will include rural delivery, and then\r\nthe express companies will come down in their rates to compete with the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: The rural delivery is limited to a single section, and is\r\nanalogous to newspaper rates.\r\n\r\nMr. HUSE: But if this pound rate is extended to library books the\r\nexpress companies will come down in their rates, and the rural delivery\r\nwill be almost free.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: But in any case if we want all these things, it won't do any\r\nharm to ask for them.\r\n\r\nMr. EASTMAN: I would like to raise one point, and that is, what would be\r\nthe effect of the extremely cheap rates of postage upon small libraries\r\nor upon libraries which we want to establish? In the remote parts of the\r\nstate, where the population is small, won't the tendency be to have one\r\ngreat library dominate the whole state? Then when you go to a community\r\nto awaken library interest the people will probably say, \"We don't care\r\nabout a library; we can get our books from New York, or Albany, or\r\nCincinnati, or Chicago.\" Won't this measure tend to hamper the work of\r\nestablishing libraries in the small places?\r\n\r\nMr. ANDERSON: That is a difficulty easily remedied. I do not think that\r\nany library should act as a forwarding agent to a person in any place\r\nwhere another public library is or can be established. Our library takes\r\nthat position very firmly. We refuse to be a forwarding agent to any\r\nperson; if a library, however small, asks us to send books, we are glad\r\nto do it. I know we have helped small libraries by making people feel\r\nthat the small library was very important, as it could get concessions\r\nthat they reasonably could not obtain.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Mr. Eastman's point, if this were a commercial question,\r\nmight have something in it, but as long as books are circulated free, we\r\nshould make the road free to the reader, for a short distance or a long\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe motion was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: We will now take up the topic of county libraries as units in\r\na state library system. Mr. Hodges, of Cincinnati, has something to say\r\non this.\r\n\r\nN. D. C. HODGES: By an act passed April 21, 1898, the privileges of the\r\nPublic Library of Cincinnati were extended to all residents of Hamilton\r\nCounty. While the trustees did not derive any revenue from the taxpayers\r\noutside of the city limits until the beginning of 1899, steps were taken\r\nat once on the passage of the act to enable all the residents of the\r\ncounty to avail themselves of their new privileges. There has been some\r\ndiscussion in the public press as to whether this library or that might\r\nclaim priority as a county library. The Public Library of Cincinnati has\r\nbeen loaning its books to all the residents of Hamilton County for more\r\nthan three years. I believe there is no other library in the state of\r\nOhio which had furnished books throughout a whole county before January\r\nof this year. This method of supplying books over a comparatively\r\nlimited territory has interest when we are discussing the circulation of\r\nbooks over a whole state from the state capital.\r\n\r\nFor those who cannot, or will not, come to the central library, there\r\nhave been established throughout the county forty-one delivery stations.\r\nFour of these are branch libraries. All these branch libraries had\r\npreviously been village libraries with very respectable histories;\r\nstarted as subscription institutions they had in years past taken on a\r\npublic character and were supported partially by taxation. There are\r\nseveral other local libraries in the county which are supported more or\r\nless by taxation and which are likely to come under the general\r\nmanagement of the trustees of the Public Library of Cincinnati, as\r\notherwise the taxpayers in the regions where they are located will be\r\nsubject to double taxation for library purposes, and, moreover, there\r\nseems to be a consensus of opinion among those who are interested in the\r\nbranches which have come under the wing of the central institution that\r\nthey have found the change to their advantage.\r\n\r\nHamilton County is not a flat region. The old part of the city of\r\nCincinnati is located on what might be called the river bottoms, though\r\nthe land is, most of it, at a safe height above the river floods. Half a\r\nmile or a mile back from the river there are sharp rises of four hundred\r\nor five hundred feet to the hill tops, on which the newer portions of\r\nthe city are built. Again, these hill tops are not tablelands but are\r\ncut here and there by deep gorges. The hilly character of the county\r\nadds to the difficulty of transportation. It is slow work for a wagon to\r\nclimb the steep ascent from the old city to the suburbs. The library\r\ndoes not have its own service of wagons, but depends on the local\r\nexpresses. There are portions of the county with which there is no\r\nregular system of communication by stage or express. It is in these\r\nregions, more or less inaccessible, though not uninhabited, that the\r\nauthorities of the library have placed travelling libraries. Twelve of\r\nthese travelling libraries were sent out in March of this year. In each\r\nlibrary there are 62 or 63 books. New books were purchased for the\r\npurpose, books of a character likely to interest the readers, the new\r\nnovels with a 40% sprinkling of the best classed literature. The\r\ntravelling libraries were arranged in three circuits of four each. Each\r\nlibrary containing 62 or 63 books, the four libraries in a circuit\r\ncontain 250 volumes. The books in circuit A are the same as those in\r\ncircuit B and as in circuit C. The libraries were placed with school\r\nteachers. Right here a difficulty has arisen on account of the closing\r\nof the schools for the summer. The country schools have rather long\r\nvacations. Some of the teachers are willing to care for their libraries\r\nduring the summer and see that they are open to the patrons. Some are\r\nnot in a position to undertake this work. For the summer months there\r\nhas been a gathering of these 12 travelling libraries at less than 12\r\nstations. The idea has been, in general, that one of these travelling\r\nlibraries should remain about six months at a station before it is moved\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe Public Library has also sent out 36 travelling libraries to the 36\r\nfire companies of the city. Each of these smaller travelling libraries\r\ncontains 20 volumes and they have been moved more rapidly than the\r\nlarger travelling libraries sent to the remote parts of the county. The\r\ndeliveries to the delivery stations vary. With some there is a daily\r\ndelivery, with others triweekly, for a few twice a week and there are\r\ntwo which have but one delivery a week.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many women's clubs in Hamilton County, Ohio. Last\r\nwinter we received programs from 37 of these clubs, and reading lists\r\nwere prepared on these programs by the cataloging department. A club\r\nalcove was set aside and an attendant assigned to aid any of the members\r\nof the clubs visiting the library for study on the papers which were to\r\nbe read. We have not attempted to send out selected lots of books for\r\nthe clubs in the suburban districts. Much better work can be done for\r\nthe readers if they will only come to the central library; and it\r\ncripples the resources of the library to scatter its reference books far\r\nand wide. We have sent such selected lots of books for limited periods\r\nto the university for the use of the students and professors, but, in\r\ngeneral, for such reference work the policy has been to encourage the\r\nuse of the central library.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the consideration of whether there is any advantage in\r\nthe system of county libraries. No very great expense is involved in a\r\njourney from the most remote corner of Hamilton County to the central\r\nlibrary in the city. Those who are intent upon serious study can, in\r\nmost cases, make a journey of 15 or 20 miles. At the central library\r\nwith a concentration of financial resources there can but be a more\r\nvaluable collection of books. On the other hand, it is perfectly\r\nfeasible for the officers of the library to visit even the most remote\r\nportions of the county and by personal interview estimate the character\r\nof the people whom they have to serve; with the result of a more\r\nintelligent distribution of books in the outlying districts. Serious\r\nstudy is provided for at the central library, while desultory reading is\r\nsupplied through the delivery stations and travelling libraries.\r\n\r\nDr. STEINER: It seems to me that it depends somewhat upon your unit of\r\nlocal government as to how much you need a county library. I should\r\nthink in Massachusetts or Connecticut the county library would be rather\r\nan unfortunate enterprise, unless used in connection with the town\r\nlibraries. But in many of the southern states the county library is\r\ngoing to be almost indispensable. With us the unit of local government\r\nis the county, except in the case of the incorporated municipality.\r\nThere is a county in Maryland with 75,000 people without a single\r\nmunicipality. The county commissioners attend to the minutest details of\r\nadministration in that county. It is manifestly unwise that the state\r\nshould take all the functions of the local library. But it seems that in\r\nthe states where we have no township system, or where the township\r\nsystem is little developed, the county library is at present a\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: How do you support the schools?\r\n\r\nDr. STEINER: By a county tax. We have school districts; but their only\r\nfunction is to have district trustees, appointed by the county\r\ncommissioners, whose duty it is to take care of the school house and\r\nappoint teachers. The taxes are raised by the county. It is the same in\r\nother southern states, so far as I know.\r\n\r\nW. T. PORTER: Mr. Hodges has said that the Public Library of Cincinnati\r\nwas a county library. Possibly that was a little misnomer, in that the\r\nlibrary still remains the Public Library of Cincinnati, but we have\r\nextended the privileges of that library to the county at large. That was\r\ndone under act of legislature of 1898, continuing the board of trustees\r\nof the public library in office, and then authorizing that board of\r\ntrustees to make a levy upon the county for the maintenance of the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: How much of the county is embraced outside of the city of\r\nCincinnati?\r\n\r\nMr. PORTER: We have about 14 townships outside of Cincinnati township.\r\nOur county is possibly 28 miles in extent.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: Then it is a small county that you supply?\r\n\r\nMr. PORTER: It is a small county, but the population is extensive. We\r\ncommenced the county delivery system in June, 1899. Up to the present,\r\nand through the stations alone, there have been about 7500 new\r\nregistrations, and we are to-day, through our stations, carrying 20,000\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: This question seems to be of a city library extending its\r\nprivileges. What I thought we were to talk about was whether the county\r\nshould be used as a library unit. That is quite a different matter.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: But in this case the county here is the unit, and is\r\ntaxed for the support of the library. There are no other public\r\nlibraries in the county.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: But there is a different side to the question. Suppose you\r\ntake a rural community and establish a county library there? I think it\r\nwould be a great extravagance to maintain not only local libraries\r\nthroughout the state, but also county libraries; it is going to cost too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: Would it not be better to have a central library?\r\n\r\nMr. PORTER: We have also in Ohio, something which approaches the county\r\nidea, known as our Van Wert law. The state of Ohio, by an act,\r\nauthorized the county commissioners of any county to accept library\r\ndonations, funds, or building. Upon the acceptance of that donation the\r\ncounty can be required to maintain a library within the building. In Van\r\nWert county, the Brumback Library building and grounds were given in\r\nthis way and the agreement was made with the county commissioners, that\r\nthey maintain thereafter a library.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Our question is not whether such libraries should exist or\r\ncan exist, but are they desirable?\r\n\r\nMr. HUSE: What is the use of asking questions that must be governed\r\nentirely by local conditions? This matter must be governed by local\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: We are trying a line of rural travelling libraries in three\r\ncounties of our state, in advance of any county or state legislation.\r\nMiss Brown, of Lucas county, and myself, in correspondence, could see no\r\nreason why a travelling library sent to Sheridan should not go on to\r\nanother point, and to another point, and so on, and then back to\r\nSheridan, back to me, and then after it had made its rounds, take\r\nanother start, and so on. We tried the plan and it has worked so well\r\nthat we are now trying it in two other counties. What the development\r\nmay be I do not know, but the satisfaction and the gratitude of the\r\npeople in the small towns it reaches is worth all it has cost of extra\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nMiss TYLER: The point of the plan is that the librarian of the\r\ncounty-seat library is responsible for the travelling library. She\r\nguards the books, watches over them and makes her library the point of\r\ndistribution. She distributes the books through the county, they come\r\nback to her library for exchange, or are passed on to the next exchange,\r\nwhichever is most convenient; but they come under her direction.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Let me state the point as I understand it. We are all agreed\r\nthat we must have local libraries for the people. They can go from their\r\nhomes into the library and take the books into their hands. If they are\r\nin the city almost every day they can utilize the large city library.\r\nWhen it comes to the question of sending books by mail or express we are\r\nall agreed that each state must have a state library and its own state\r\ncommission. The question is, Should there be an intermediary point\r\nbetween a state library and the local library? It seems, at first\r\nthought, that there should be, because you would have a shorter distance\r\nto travel, but all commercial experience is against this. Manufacturers\r\nare closing factories all the while and paying transportation, because\r\nthey can do their work more cheaply in one place. Thus, repair of books,\r\nchecking lists, and all that kind of work can be done under a single\r\nexecutive at some central point in the state more cheaply than if there\r\nwas a library in each county. In Wisconsin, with 71 counties, you would\r\nhave 71 libraries and you would have to duplicate great quantities of\r\nbooks. My experience indicates that we can do this work more cheaply and\r\nmore economically by putting the books under control of a central\r\nlibrary. As to the extra distance, very often the identical trains that\r\nwould take the books from a county seat would have brought them from the\r\ncapital as it went through, so that they would have been received almost\r\nwithout delay. Is it going to pay to introduce a new ganglion--that is,\r\nthe county library?\r\n\r\nDr. STEINER: Take Baltimore county in Maryland. There is a county with\r\n75,000 people; it has an electric lighting system, a police court, fire\r\nengine houses; there are towns in that county of a thousand people.\r\nThere is no government in that county except the board of county\r\ncommissioners, who are as complete autocrats as the czar of Russia.\r\nThere is no municipality in the county; there is one town which has 5000\r\npeople. You must have a county library with a county administration,\r\nbecause you cannot have anything but the county library; you cannot\r\ndiscriminate between one part of the county and another. That library\r\nmust send books equally to all parts of the county; you cannot put it\r\nwhere the great centers of the population are, because you cannot\r\ndeprive any citizen of the county of his right to draw books.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Of course, we are not discussing a peculiar condition such as\r\nexists in Maryland.\r\n\r\nDr. STEINER: It is not a peculiar condition; it is the condition of at\r\nleast one-third of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: It seems to me that there is nothing peculiar about this\r\ncondition. Of course, it differs from conditions in the north, but it\r\nincludes a state government, to which the county is subordinate, and if\r\nI understand Mr. Dewey, it is his purpose to do this work from the state\r\nas a center, and the question he has raised is whether it is better to\r\ndo it from the county as a center, or from the state as a center. I\r\nthink that in our state it would be well to use the county as a center,\r\nfor a time at least. However, I believe that in our state \"benevolent\r\nneutrality\"--to apply the term that Mr. Putnam used the other day--on\r\nthe part of the state librarian toward these matters would be more\r\neffective than \"benevolent assimilation,\" and we hope for much from the\r\ncounty library system.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: It is a question of what we should encourage. Is it wise to\r\ndo this work by the county unit or the state unit? It is largely an\r\neconomic question. How can you give the people the best reading for the\r\nleast amount of money?\r\n\r\nR. P. HAYES: In North Carolina we have practically nothing in the\r\nlibrary field and the question is, shall we try for county library\r\ndevelopment or state library development? I would like to get some\r\ndefinite word on that.\r\n\r\nDr. STEINER: It seems to me we should try distinctly for county\r\nlibraries. In the southern states at least there is no question about\r\nit; you have got to have county libraries. I started with the idea of\r\nthe local township libraries, but we must wait until we have a township.\r\nMy idea is, in any county wherein there are no incorporated\r\nmunicipalities or where the incorporated municipalities do not care to\r\nsupport libraries, the county library is the proper thing. In the south\r\nthe county takes the place of the town in New England; it is the taxing\r\nunit, the unit in which all the local administration is carried on.\r\n\r\nMr. HUSE: It seems to me that for the south, as stated by the gentlemen\r\nhere from Maryland and from North Carolina, the county system is very\r\nprobably the best one; but in New England we could not work by a county\r\nunit, any more than the people of North Carolina and even further down\r\nsouth could run a toboggan slide nine months in the year--they would not\r\nhave the ice; we haven't the counties. At least, we have the counties,\r\nbut they are of no importance to us except to have court houses, and\r\ncourts of justice. Now, each state must solve this problem according to\r\nits own conditions and according to the desires and enthusiasm of its\r\nown workers. The gentleman from Maryland, I haven't any doubt, will soon\r\nhave the county system operating fully and successfully in his state,\r\nand the same will be true in North Carolina and throughout the south;\r\nwhereas in New England it won't be done because the county is not a\r\nunit. In Wisconsin and New York, Mr. Dewey and Mr. Hutchins, and the men\r\nand women who know more than they do, will run the library system\r\nsafely; whether it is state or county. But we cannot adopt any general\r\nrule or take any general expression of opinion, for the people in each\r\nstate must work out their own salvation according to their own\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: There are a number of other topics that have been specially\r\nasked for.\r\n\r\nCan state commissions provide travelling libraries for hamlets which\r\nfurnish the money, and make such hamlets travelling library stations?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: I wish to say a few words on that question. All through\r\nWisconsin, when we started travelling libraries, some people found that\r\nthere was a chance to make money by using the idea in a commercial way.\r\nThey went to communities which had heard of the travelling libraries,\r\nraised $150 or so for \"subscription\" and then sent about ten dollars'\r\nworth of books once in six months. Now, the plan we have worked out may\r\nbe best described by this illustration: about a year ago Miss Stearns\r\nheard that there was a little hamlet of fishermen far up in the state on\r\na point which juts out into Lake Michigan. It included about a hundred\r\npeople who had heard of the travelling libraries, but they did not want\r\nto be indebted for a gift or a charity, and so they had a series of\r\nentertainments, and raised fifty dollars. They sent the money down to us\r\nand we agreed to buy a library in their name. That library was the\r\ncontribution of the fishermen of the hamlet of Jacksonport, and the\r\nhamlet was made a travelling library station. You can see how such a\r\nmethod works out. The second point is, that in communities where there\r\nare a hundred people or so, and conditions are favorable, we offer to\r\ngive them travelling libraries on condition that they establish\r\npermanent public libraries on lines that are satisfactory to us. We take\r\ncare of the travelling libraries and they take care of the local\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, that in this method we have struck finally the correct\r\nprinciple, the principle of self-support. The state takes the money and\r\ngives trained service in the selection of the books, in taking care of\r\nthem, and in keeping the books travelling around their circuit. The\r\ncitizens pay for their books, and have the feeling that they belong to\r\nan organization. More than all, when they are collecting their library\r\nfund, giving their little \"dime socials,\" contributing two dollars or\r\nfive dollars apiece, they are advertising that library, and it seems to\r\nme that the library that is coming to them that way means far more than\r\nthe library that is given to them as a charity.\r\n\r\nMr. GALBREATH: Mr. Hutchins, how often do the communities raise that\r\nfifty dollars?\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: They raise fifty dollars once, and for that the state\r\nengages to send them libraries during the life of the library given by\r\nthem, which we estimate to be about six years.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: What shall be the unit of circulation--the cataloged library\r\nor the single book or combination?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: We have tried both in Iowa. One of the twins is growing\r\nfaster than the other, and of course that is the hopeful one.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: Which one is that?\r\n\r\nMr. BRIGHAM: That is the individual, or the single book as the unit,\r\nrather than the travelling library; but I believe that the shelf-listed\r\nlibrary will always exist. The shelf-listed library of 50 or 25 books\r\nmust be a necessity in the communities where there are no libraries, and\r\nI am sorry to say that there are a great many communities of that sort;\r\nbut the communities in which there are libraries are increasing, and\r\nwherever there is a local library, or wherever there is a woman's club,\r\nthere the single book can be used to the best advantage. There are\r\ndisadvantages in the use of the shelf-listed library. Before we adopted\r\nthe new system, we often had requests for library no. 38 or no. 53, and\r\nlater found that the request arose from the fact that there was a single\r\nbook, or perhaps two books in that library, that some one wanted, while\r\nthe rest of the volumes would come back comparatively unused. That was\r\nnot good business economy. We might better have sent those two books,\r\nand I became more and more impressed with this fact, and was finally\r\nable to partially adopt the other plan. We have now perhaps 2000 books\r\non our shelves that are issued separately; but we have nearly 5000 tied\r\nup in libraries. Both classes are in use, but the expense to the local\r\nlibrary of getting our collection of 50 books for the sake of using\r\nperhaps two volumes is unnecessary. I am more and more impressed with\r\nthe fact--though the remark may be unorthodox--that there is prevalent a\r\nlittle fad for spending money for administration, and spending it not\r\nalways economically. I believe in spending money freely for\r\nadministration that is approved by good common sense; beyond that it is\r\na woful waste of money. And so I would keep the use of the single book\r\nin mind. The women's clubs as you know, are studying more and more, and\r\nare doing less and less miscellaneous reading. Suppose we are trying to\r\nmeet the wants of the women's clubs. We put up a library covering the\r\nVictorian period in literature, and we find that some one wants a\r\ncertain number of books on the lake poets. What is the use of sending\r\nthe entire library? We may have a library made up on the lake poets.\r\nThen, suppose one librarian or one secretary writes for what we may have\r\non Coleridge, another wishes material on Wordsworth. Why not send the\r\nColeridge books to the one, and the Wordsworth books to the other? In\r\nthat way, make the books count. We should not be penurious in the matter\r\nof expenditure for cases or for printing, or for any other working\r\ntools, but we should always keep in mind that the essential thing is the\r\nbook, and if we can get on without the book case, or without the cover\r\nthat envelops it, or without the shipping case, or without the\r\ncombination book case and shipping case, all the better. We cannot get\r\nalong without them altogether, but we can send small packages all over\r\nthe state wrapped in paper, and can get rid of a great deal of expense.\r\n\r\nMr. DEWEY: When you send ten books, of course send them in paper, but\r\nwhen you send 50 or 100, send them in boxes; that is cheaper. This is a\r\nmere shipping question.\r\n\r\nAdjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   WORK OF STATE LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS AND WOMEN'S CLUBS IN ADVANCING\r\n                LIBRARY INTERESTS: ROUND TABLE MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work that can be done by state library associations and women's\r\nclubs to advance library interests was considered in a \"round table\"\r\nmeeting, held in the assembly room, Fountain Spring House, on the\r\nmorning of Wednesday, July 10. Miss MARILLA WAITE FREEMAN presided as\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\nMiss FREEMAN: At the Montreal conference last year a round table meeting\r\nof officers of state library associations was held for the discussion of\r\nquestions affecting association work. Certain subjects, some of which\r\nwere informally discussed at that time, seem naturally to invite our\r\nattention at the present session. We are to consider the object and\r\nfunctions of state library associations--whether they should attempt\r\nother lines of effort than the holding of a general meeting; what\r\nprinciples as to time and place of meeting, topics, and participants\r\nshould govern the preparation of a program. With this general subject\r\nhas been joined the allied topic of the work of women's clubs in\r\nadvancing library interests. Few of us fully comprehend even yet the\r\namount of effective library extension work which has been and is being\r\naccomplished by club women in almost every state of the Union. I have\r\nasked representative members from some of the states which have been\r\nworking along these lines to tell us of their work. We shall hear first\r\nfrom Mr. J. C. Dana, of the City Library, Springfield, Mass., the\r\nWestern Massachusetts Club, and the Massachusetts Library Club, on\r\n\r\n\r\n         WHAT THE WORK OF STATE LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS SHOULD BE.\r\n\r\nJ. C. DANA: Perhaps the chief purposes of a state library association\r\nare to arouse an interest in libraries among the public and to increase\r\nthe knowledge and enthusiasm of the members of the profession. The\r\nmistake is often made of thinking that the chief purpose of an\r\nassociation is to hold an annual meeting. It is thought that the annual\r\nmeeting once provided with a good program, and that well carried\r\nthrough, the work of the association for the whole year is done. There\r\ncould not be a greater mistake. The benefits of a state association come\r\nlargely from correspondence between members, the preparation for the\r\nmeeting, and the securing of ideas, new methods and statistics by\r\ncirculating letters among members, and the publication in newspapers and\r\nelsewhere of notes about the meeting which is to come and the meetings\r\nwhich have been. One is almost tempted to say that a library association\r\nperforms its duty better if it is active during the year--carrying on\r\ncorrespondence and thoroughly advertising itself--and holds no meeting\r\nwhatever, than it does if it holds an annual meeting and does not\r\nadvertise.\r\n\r\nAnother mistake common to those who organize state library associations\r\nis to suppose that they are chiefly designed for the benefit of those\r\nwho organize them. They do not realize that to help younger and less\r\nexperienced members of the craft is a chief purpose of the association,\r\nand that if through it librarians generally are informed and encouraged,\r\nthe profession itself is thereby improved, and they are themselves\r\nadvanced in general esteem.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, an association's business to be active all through the\r\nyear, to devote itself largely to such work in and between its meetings\r\nas will benefit both beginners and past-masters among librarians, and,\r\nalways, properly to advertise its work. Along this last line let me say\r\nan urgent word in favor of good printing. It is difficult to\r\noverestimate the value to an institution like a library association of\r\nan exhibition of itself, through all its circulars and programs and\r\nlists, by means of the best printing that money can buy.\r\n\r\nThe general state association, being the largest and richest of all\r\nassociations in a given state, should take upon itself some large\r\ndefinite work of permanent value and as far as possible of general\r\ninterest; say the compilation of historical material, the making of a\r\nuseful index, the issuance of popular lists, etc., etc. This work may\r\ncontinue along the same line for several years, ending in the\r\npublication of something thoroughly worth while which shall have been\r\nthe means of arousing interest in the profession itself and of bringing\r\nthe members of it into touch with one another month by month and year by\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAs to the place of meeting of the state association, I doubt if much\r\nbenefit accrues, on the whole, from meetings held in remote places for\r\nmissionary purposes. I say this, of course, on the supposition that the\r\nmeetings thus held, being at places difficult of access, will not\r\ngenerally draw a large gathering. Better results can generally be\r\nreached in these same small communities by sending to them occasionally\r\none or two active representatives of the association to carry on a\r\nlittle propaganda work, speak before a woman's club, before the school\r\nteachers, or a local literary society on the local library problems.\r\n\r\nAbout the programs of association meetings, it is difficult to say\r\nanything which will have general application. They must, of course, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, fit local conditions. I do not think it advisable\r\nto give up much time to local speakers, either for words of greeting or\r\nfor historical sketches. These latter are generally unspeakably dull. On\r\nthe other hand, if popular interest in a place is desired a local\r\nspeaker may be the one best means available for accomplishing your\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nAssociations which are attended, as so many are, by librarians of\r\nsmaller libraries who rarely get abroad and do not often have an\r\nopportunity to meet their fellows and to expand in the social atmosphere\r\nof the library meeting, should cultivate to the greatest possible extent\r\nwhat one may call the conversational feature. Not only should ample\r\nopportunity be given before and after and between the sessions for\r\ninformal talks, but a portion of the formal gathering itself should be\r\ndevoted to brief and rapid exchange of ideas. This can be brought about\r\nby a little preliminary wire-pulling. Let some one briefly open a topic,\r\nand then let questions be offered, some of them by the most diffident of\r\nthose present who have previously been posted as to what they are to ask\r\nand when. Manufacture a little spontaneity by way of an ice-breaker, and\r\nit is surprising how freely genuine spontaneity will then flow. It is\r\nunquestionably of great value to a librarian who is unselfishly giving\r\nher energy to a small library in a remote place, trying to make her\r\nbooks of use, to be able to express herself, no matter how briefly, on\r\nsome of the matters which touch her work at home.\r\n\r\nA state association should draw out the diffident; cheer the discouraged\r\nones; magnify our calling; compel public attention to the value of\r\nlibraries; be active the whole year through; and always keep a little\r\nahead of the general library progress in the state.\r\n\r\nMiss ELLA MCLONEY: It is unquestionably true, as has been stated, that\r\nthe annual meeting of a state library association is not the whole of\r\nthe work that must be done through the year. It is possibly only an\r\nincident, but the fact is that in the nature of things the work of\r\npreparation for this meeting must be carried on during at least half the\r\nyear. The preparation of the programs requires a great deal of\r\ncorrespondence, and this must extend over a great part of the state and\r\nduring a great part of the year. Whenever any circulars or announcements\r\nare issued, they should be sent to every library in the state; it does\r\nnot matter whether that library is likely to be represented or not, it\r\nshould have information as to the work that is being done by the state\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nSo far as advertising a library is concerned it seems to me a good deal\r\nof a problem. Of course, library people, like other people, need the\r\nhelp of the newspapers, but if you want to get the newspapers interested\r\nin libraries it will have to be on the strength of something more than\r\nwhat libraries are going to do. In other words, it will have to be\r\nsomething that the newspapers can take up as news and feel that the\r\npublic are interested in; they want material that is fresh and newsy,\r\nand if you can furnish them with that, then the newspapers will be\r\nwilling to help.\r\n\r\nAs to the printing of programs and other material, I am hardly prepared\r\nto say that library associations should always have the best and most\r\nexpensive work. It is a proper thing, theoretically, to appear before\r\nthe public in the handsomest and most suitable dress possible, but when\r\nevery 25 cents is of importance and your treasury is practically empty,\r\nand there is no one upon whom you can legitimately draw to fill it, I\r\nthink you must limit your work accordingly.\r\n\r\nAbout definite work to be done, it is true of a library association, as\r\nof any other association, that it should do something that will furnish\r\na reason for its existence. In most cases the most definite thing, if\r\nyou are beginners in association work, will be the task of gaining a\r\nfoothold; but the time will probably come when it will be necessary to\r\nundertake some definite work, that the life of the association may be\r\nprolonged and finally assured. The Iowa association, for its first three\r\nor four years, was a very frail child, and required most careful\r\nnursing; but finally, about the fourth year, it began to seem as if\r\nthere was very good prospect of its growth and development. Miss Ahern,\r\nwhom Illinois has claimed for the last five years, and who was at that\r\ntime interested in the Iowa work, devised the plan of establishing a\r\nfour years' course of library study, an ambitious undertaking in the\r\ncondition of affairs in Iowa then. This was printed in a neat folder,\r\nwhich was sent to every library in the state, with a circular telling\r\nthem what the plan was, and that the library association wished the\r\nlibrarians of the state to enter upon this four years' course of study,\r\nand asked all who would pledge themselves to do so to come to the next\r\nmeeting with their report of the work. I received seven letters in\r\nresponse to all this circular work, and when the time for the annual\r\nmeeting came there was no one there to report. Librarians were too busy,\r\ntoo far apart, and too poorly paid, to permit the work being carried on\r\nsystematically. It was dropped at that point; I think it could be done\r\nnow, and it may be taken up yet. It did furnish a common bond, although\r\nthe results were not very evident just then.\r\n\r\nThe next thing, as has been the case with many other associations, was\r\nthe work of securing the library commission. We pegged away at that for\r\nfive years before we accomplished anything. Finally the State Federation\r\nof Women's Clubs interested itself; we secured the commission, and the\r\nwork has been going on exceedingly well for the past year. We have made\r\nno plan yet for further definite work, but some need will doubtless\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nIn regard to programs, they must, of course, as Mr. Dana said, be\r\nadapted to local conditions, and the people who are primarily the\r\nworkers in the state association, cannot expect personally to get much\r\nfrom the program or from the work of the association. But it is probably\r\ntrue in most cases that these workers have opportunities of visiting\r\nother libraries, and have facilities for work that are not open to the\r\nlibrarians in the smaller places. The librarians of the smaller\r\nlibraries should be given something definite, something technical,\r\nsomething that will be of help to them in the work from a professional\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nAs to place of meeting, the Iowa meetings were always held in Des\r\nMoines, the capital city, until two years ago. Then it was decided to\r\nmake the library association a movable feast. We met at Cedar Rapids\r\ntwo years ago, last year at Sioux City, where we had a good meeting,\r\nalthough not largely attended. Sioux City is in the extreme western part\r\nof the state, and is not easily accessible by railroad, but we drew a\r\nlittle from South Dakota, which was what we had counted on; some Dakota\r\npeople came and joined the association, and two of those people have\r\nattended this A. L. A. conference. We meet next in Burlington, where\r\nthere are more libraries in the locality, and we expect a larger\r\nattendance. I suppose the ideal condition would be to meet in some\r\ncentral place, where there are library facilities, but I believe it is\r\nworth while to move the association about; that is one way of\r\nadvertising it.\r\n\r\nMiss OLIVE JONES: I fully believe that the greatest work of the state\r\nassociation it does through the librarians individually. It is of help\r\nin the state in bringing out different lines of work, and in keeping the\r\nlibrary work before the public; but, after all, do we not gain more from\r\nindividual effort than from anything else? In educational problems, it\r\nis coming to be realized that the work of the individual means more than\r\nthe work of any body of people, and I am fully convinced, if we can\r\nbring librarians to our state associations, and have an association full\r\nof enthusiasm and that intangible something which we call library\r\nspirit, we will have more done for the state at large than by any\r\ndevising of general work along large lines. I would make a special plea\r\nthat in deciding where to meet, you should consider first the\r\nlibrarians, and settle a pleasant place for the members who meet\r\nfellow-workers only once a year. There are librarians who have no\r\nvacation at all, except when their board kindly allows them to go to the\r\nstate association meeting; there are librarians who never know\r\npersonally anything of this larger work done all over the country, and\r\nwe should not ask such persons to come to a place where they are not\r\ngoing to be comfortable, and which they must spend a good deal of money\r\nto reach. We must be sure of having something for the librarians of the\r\nsmaller libraries; something technical, not too much, but something\r\nwhich the librarian can take away, feeling that it has been worth while\r\nto attend. I am not certain that we could have library instruction in\r\nOhio; we tried it and it did not seem to work; but if you can introduce\r\nin the program one or two definite, technical papers, it is a good\r\nthing. And at the same time give a chance for sociability and some\r\nsocial entertainment.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point, and that is in regard to the advertising that\r\nwe can do through individuals--you see my point is individualism. I\r\nbelieve in newspaper advertising, but I think if you can work up a good\r\nmailing list through your state, sending all your circulars to\r\nindividuals, you will do more than by newspaper advertising. And it is a\r\ngood thing to get one library in each city to keep a list of every one\r\nin that city who ought to be specially interested in library work,\r\nwhether members of the association or not. Then let that librarian send\r\nto the secretary of the association a duplicate of that list, so that\r\neverything the state association issues goes to each person who should\r\nbe interested in library work.\r\n\r\nW. R. EASTMAN: In New York we are going through a little transition\r\nperiod in state library association work. Formerly our state association\r\nheld occasional meetings in different places. It held one in midwinter\r\nin New York City, with the New York Library Club. Then in the summer or\r\nspring we held a meeting in the central part of the state. We tried to\r\nmake our programs as practical as could be, discussing not only\r\noccasional technical points, but elementary points as well. We always\r\nhad good meetings; we got together a little circle of librarians who\r\nwere interested, and we thought the state association was worth keeping\r\nup, although the state was so large that we reached only one or two\r\ncenters. About a year ago, under a new administration, Dr. Canfield\r\nsuggested that the annual meeting should always be held in one place. We\r\nconsented to try the plan, and decided to make Lake Placid, in the\r\nAdirondacks, our meeting place. We met there, and the association, to my\r\nsurprise and somewhat to my disturbance, first voted always to meet in\r\none place, and then voted always to meet at Lake Placid. We then made a\r\nproviso instructing the executive board to district the state into 10 or\r\n12 districts, and lay out a plan by which every one of those districts\r\nshould have a library conference in the course of the year. Thus,\r\ninstead of one meeting of the state during a year, we are going to have\r\n12 local conferences. Whether those local conferences will have an\r\norganization I do not know; the board has not yet reported its plan.\r\nProbably there will be some sort of a skeleton organization--a president\r\nand secretary, and perhaps some one in charge of each local conference,\r\nand then some member of the association will probably come and attend\r\nthe conference. Our object is to bring together the librarians and\r\nlibrary trustees for 50 miles around; if the teachers are interested, so\r\nmuch the better. So, you see, we have begun to establish a system of\r\nlocal conferences all over the state. It is not extravagant; it is\r\nhopeful; I believe there is a great deal in it, especially for the\r\nlarger states.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: I for one would protest against always meeting in one\r\nplace, unless as Mr. Eastman has described, the meeting is held at a\r\nresort. I have known cases where meetings were held at one central,\r\nlarge town, because it was so accessible; and the librarian of a little\r\nlibrary, who cannot have open shelves and all facilities, goes to this\r\ntown and sees its large library, with its red tape, and gets so\r\ncompletely tangled up in the red tape of that institution that she will\r\nnever be able to disentangle herself. I believe in the migration of\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nH. C. WELLMAN: I am in hearty sympathy with what has been said in regard\r\nto extending library work through the state. It is especially valuable\r\nin the newer states of the Union, but in the older states, in New\r\nEngland, in New York, and elsewhere, I think we must not attend too\r\nstrictly to the extension of library work, but must rather intensify it.\r\nA state library association, as Miss Jones said, can do a great deal for\r\nlibrarians and for the library profession. The Massachusetts Library\r\nClub has done something in the way of giving a series of lectures, to\r\nrun two or three years. The first lecture dealt with paper making, the\r\nsubject being treated by an expert; then came book illustration, of\r\nwhich most librarians knew absolutely nothing; and then, finally, book\r\nbinding, for which we had one of the best binders of the state to come\r\ndown and show us the tricks of the trade. You are all library school\r\ngraduates out here; but in the effete east nine-tenths of the librarians\r\nhave not had that technical training. I do not know anything that was of\r\nmore practical good to our club membership than that lecture on library\r\nbinding. There is another thing that we ought to do, and that is to give\r\nattention to the more scholarly side of librarianship. We are so busy\r\norganizing, so busy spreading library ideas, that we are in danger of\r\nlosing sight of scholarship. That is something the state association can\r\ndo--in the directions of literature, bibliography, and such subjects. I\r\nthink that should be emphasized more than has been the case. In the\r\nMassachusetts Club we are trying a similar scheme to that of Mr.\r\nEastman; we are going to have one annual meeting, which will take in all\r\nthe library clubs all over the state. Then, besides that, the state club\r\nmeets about three times a year in different parts of the state.\r\n\r\nIn concluding, I want to make sure that this round table is to be\r\ncontinued, and I therefore move that this assembly petition the program\r\ncommittee of next year for another round table meeting on this subject.\r\n_Voted._\r\n\r\nMiss M. E. AHERN: I want to say a word about this matter of having\r\nperipatetic meetings. In the state of Illinois we have all the library\r\nlaw and all the library books in the northern part of the state, and\r\nthen there is a part of the state down in the south that they call\r\n\"Egypt.\" There may be some libraries there, but we have been unable yet\r\nto induce them to take their place in the state library association. Two\r\nyears ago, after having tried for several years to get these libraries\r\nto come into the association, we brought the association to them, and\r\nheld our meeting in East St. Louis, under the most distressing\r\ncircumstances of weather and other uncomfortable conditions; and not a\r\nsingle librarian from that community attended the meeting. We tried the\r\nsame plan last year in another place in the state, and I felt when the\r\nmeeting was over that we had not done much good there. Very few of the\r\nlocal people came to the meeting. Later I heard that we did some good,\r\nbut I am inclined to think that the personal efforts of the librarians\r\nat that place did more than the association did. I am not at all a\r\npessimist, but in Illinois this plan has failed to interest the people\r\nof the indifferent districts in the work that the library association\r\nwas trying to do, and I have been almost convinced that it is the proper\r\nthing for an association to get a central point and bring librarians in\r\ntouch with the vitalizing spirit of a good library conference, rather\r\nthan to try to take the association to an indifferent community. I want\r\nheartily to emphasize the point made by Mr. Dana about local speakers. I\r\nhave suffered more than once from these local speakers. I have a most\r\ndistinct recollection of hearing a trustee talk for one hour and a\r\nquarter on the beautiful, magnanimous and generous efforts made by\r\nhimself to run the local library. The point made by Mr. Wellman needs to\r\nbe taken cautiously. I think there is more danger of emphasizing the\r\nscholarly side of librarianship at state meetings than there is of not\r\ngiving it sufficient attention. The American Library Association, in my\r\nopinion, should stand for the higher tenets of the library faith, and\r\nthe scholarly side should be more emphasized than has been the case\r\nheretofore in the meetings of the national association. With all our\r\ndifferent organizations, clubs, associations, conferences, round tables,\r\nand so on, it seems to me that the American Library Association should\r\ntake care of the technical side, and the smaller questions, that must,\r\nindeed, be settled by local conditions, should be taken up by the state\r\nassociations. While, of course, we want to have material of a high order\r\npresented at the state association, at the same time we must remember\r\nthat these associations reach those people who cannot be touched in any\r\nother way; and if they have come to get light on this new topic of work\r\nfor children, or if they are on the point of reorganizing their library,\r\nor if they are having trouble with their board, they do not take kindly\r\nto a dissertation on printing in the 15th century.\r\n\r\nOne thing has been left out in the various interests which have been\r\nbrought forward, and that is the part of the trustee in the state\r\nassociation meetings. A librarian may have all possible inclination, and\r\nall the enthusiasm that we can give her, but if she does not have the\r\nco-operation and the kindly sympathy of her library board, or at least a\r\nmajority of its members, life is to her a burden. Her condition is worse\r\nthan when she did not know, and did not know that she did not know. The\r\nstate associations have not so far been open enough to the trustees. It\r\nseems to me that this is a subject well worth taking up, and we should\r\ntry to do more for the library trustees of the state than we have done\r\nheretofore. Necessarily they take rather a material view of the\r\nsituation, and we should try to lead them away from the dollar-and-cents\r\nview of library work. These two things need to be emphasized--keep in\r\nmind the small librarian, and educate the trustee. Some one has said\r\nthat we need a library school for trustees quite as much as we need a\r\nlibrary school for librarians, and the more I see of libraries the more\r\nI believe that.\r\n\r\nMrs. E. J. DOCKERY spoke on\r\n\r\n\r\n             HOW A LIBRARY COMMISSION WAS SECURED IN IDAHO.\r\n\r\nI bring to you an accurate and complete history of the course adopted by\r\nthe club women of my state in securing library legislation, as I\r\npersonally participated in the work with other members of the Woman's\r\nColumbian Club, the organization that had the direct and immediate\r\ncharge of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat embarrassing confession to make that Idaho, with its\r\narea of 87,000 square miles and a population of 164,000 souls, and its\r\nsobriquet of \"The gem of the Mountains,\" has not a free circulating\r\nlibrary. I make this statement, however, to emphasize the virgin field\r\nin which we had to labor and the munificence of our legislators when we\r\nconsider the various tax burdens are so many and the number so few to\r\nbear them.\r\n\r\nBoisé City, the capital of our state, with a population of 10,000, is\r\nthe home of the Woman's Columbian Club of 200 members. This club, among\r\nits many achievements, established and almost wholly supports a public\r\nlibrary of 2750 volumes at Boisé; and its members stand in the vanguard\r\nand do yeoman's service as leaders and in the ranks in all causes to\r\nadvance the moral, intellectual and material good of all the people of\r\nthe state that has granted women equal suffrage with men.\r\n\r\nThe club strongly urges the formation of other woman's clubs throughout\r\nthe state, and encourages at all times the organization and development\r\nof free libraries.\r\n\r\nThe first really effective and aggressive step of the club in this\r\ndirection, and which led to important results, was the adoption of the\r\nfree travelling library scheme. Its zealous members, by united action\r\nand individual effort, accumulated sufficient funds to put into\r\ncirculation 15 travelling libraries with a total of 800 volumes, and\r\ninvited discussion of this work in the public press.\r\n\r\nAt the 1899 state teachers' meeting representatives of the club, on\r\ninvitation, espoused the cause of the travelling library and libraries\r\ngenerally. The demand for library cases soon exhausted the Columbian\r\nClub's ability to respond, and then an appeal for legislative aid was\r\ndetermined upon, and systematic methods, principally through the press,\r\nwere pursued to awaken public sentiment favorable to the election of\r\nfriendly legislators.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of the legislators in 1900 the Columbian Club sent\r\ncircular letters to each one, setting forth the merits of the two bills\r\nthe club had prepared and upon which its energies were concentrated,\r\nnamely: a bill creating a state library commission, and a bill\r\nauthorizing common councils of cities and governing bodies of\r\ncommunities to levy a tax not to exceed one mill on the assessed\r\nvaluation of property for the establishment and maintenance of free\r\nreading rooms and libraries.\r\n\r\nSimilar circular letters were sent to each of the 75 newspapers\r\npublished in the state. All women's clubs were importuned to co-operate,\r\nand also all public school officials, teachers and educators of the\r\nstate. The press responded right royally with one single exception, and\r\nbook lovers and educators of high and low degree lent their willing\r\nassistance. Representatives of the club again appeared before the 1900\r\nannual state teachers' meeting, and secured an official endorsement from\r\nthat body for the proposed library legislation. The state teachers'\r\nassociation, in addition, advocated a law requiring that three per cent.\r\nof all school moneys be set aside as a fund for school libraries, to\r\nwhich the club women gave their aid and which also became a law.\r\n\r\nAt the convening of the legislature in January of this year the leaven\r\nhad begun to work, thus paving the way for the successful lobbying by\r\nthe official representatives of the Columbian Club.\r\n\r\nThe first step was the selection of a conspicuous legislator to stand\r\nsponsor for our bills. In this we encountered an embarrassment of riches\r\nin capable legislative material, but finally selected Senator S. P.\r\nDonnelly, who cheerfully assumed the duty, and exerted the full force of\r\nhis wide popularity and marked ability from the time of his introduction\r\nof the bills until the final vote upon them.\r\n\r\nThe club members held frequent conferences with the educational\r\ncommittee of both houses of the legislature and other legislators\r\nspecially interested in educational matters, and made plain to them the\r\ninestimable benefits of the bills we championed.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connection I desire to make graceful acknowledgment to the\r\nlibrary workers of Wisconsin, as it was while a resident of this state I\r\nreceived from them my first library inspiration; and particularly do I\r\ndesire to acknowledge our indebtedness to Mr. F. L. Hutchins, whose\r\npersonal communications and generous supply of library literature\r\nenabled us to fully present our subject and to meet all objections\r\nraised by some of the legislators.\r\n\r\nEvery member of the legislature, with the exception of one in the lower\r\nhouse, was buttonholed, and the consequence of that oversight was\r\nmanifested on the final voting day.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the club requested the home papers of the legislators to\r\ncontinue to urge favorable action; and the club women from all parts of\r\nthe state, by letters, personal visits and petitions to the legislators,\r\ndid likewise.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of partisanship, a peculiarity of all legislative bodies,\r\nwas not manifested in the least.\r\n\r\nOn the day for the final action in the Senate Committee of the Whole the\r\nColumbian Club was notified and attended in a body, the courtesy of the\r\nfloor being extended to us.\r\n\r\nImagine our consternation, when the question was submitted to an aye and\r\nnay vote, at not a voice being raised in its favor save Senator\r\nDonnelly's. For a few moments silence so profound that it was almost\r\npalpable prevailed, when presently Senator Kinkaid, who was in the\r\nchair, without calling for the nays, solemnly announced, \"The ayes have\r\nit\"; and delight supplanted our agonized distress as the pleasantry at\r\nSenator Donnelly's expense and ours dawned upon us.\r\n\r\nThe bill was then placed upon its final passage, and the senators, who\r\nhesitated in their support on the ground of economy only, announced that\r\nthey would vote in favor of the bill, but desired it expressly\r\nunderstood that they did so because they were intimidated by the\r\npresence of the Columbian Club. The best of spirits prevailed, and our\r\nbill providing for a state library commission of five members, two at\r\nleast to be women, passed the senate unanimously, the president of the\r\nstate university and the superintendent of public instruction to be _ex\r\nofficio_ members and the other three members to be appointed by the\r\ngovernor; and the law appropriated $6000 for the purchase of travelling\r\nlibrary books and the maintenance of the commission for two years.\r\n\r\nThe bill was sent to the lower house to take its course in that body,\r\nbut we were denied the privilege of practicing intimidation there.\r\nImmediately upon its arrival in the house a member moved that it be made\r\na special order of business and be immediately placed upon its final\r\npassage, and that a polite message be sent the president of the\r\nColumbian Club that the house would perform its solemn duties without\r\nthe assistance or coercion of that club.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the house unanimously save for the solitary negative\r\nvote of the member whom, by an inexplicable oversight, we failed to\r\ninterview, and who announced he so voted for that reason.\r\n\r\nThis library commission bill was by all odds the most conspicuous matter\r\nbefore the legislature, and the enrolled bill submitted to the governor\r\nfor signature was elaborately prepared and adorned with the club colors\r\nby the attaches of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe commission has been in existence three months, or more properly\r\nspeaking, less than two months, for the necessary preliminary work did\r\nnot enable us to get before the public until May. Already we have been\r\ninvited to assist and direct the formation of six libraries and to\r\nselect books for the penitentiary library, have placed in circulation 10\r\nnew travelling library cases in addition to the 15 cases donated to the\r\nstate by the Columbian Club, and have 20 more cases in preparation.\r\n\r\nWhile the law provided for the appointment of at least two women on the\r\ncommission, the governor appointed three, two of whom are members of the\r\nColumbian Club; and our superintendent of public instruction being a\r\nwoman, we have four of the five members, and what is more especially to\r\nthe point, they are all club women.\r\n\r\nWoman's clubs may with propriety, I think, lay claim to some credit for\r\nlibrary laws in Idaho, and yet it is significant that the reason for\r\ntheir power lies in the fact that the women of our state have in their\r\nhands the wand of progress and civilization, the most powerful and\r\nbloodless offensive and defensive weapon on earth--the ballot. In the\r\nhand of the frailest of our sex this powerful weapon can strike as\r\ndeadly a blow at evil or as strenuous a blow for good as it can in the\r\nhands of the brawniest of fighting men; no moral wretch of whatever size\r\nand strength but what the very gentlest of our number can cancel his\r\nregistered will on election day; for an aspiring public servant to dare\r\noppose a righteous cause means sure defeat--for womanhood inevitably\r\narrays itself against the hosts of error.\r\n\r\nThe women of our state, marshalled under the leadership of women's\r\nclubs, stood in an unwavering and united array for all our library laws\r\nand every other law that stood for good; and there were, all told, 15\r\nbills affecting education enacted into laws at the last session.\r\n\r\nWhatever of inspiration and encouragement the success of women's clubs\r\nin Idaho may give our sister clubs in sister states, the success of\r\nwoman's suffrage there at any rate will help to silence the scoffers'\r\nsneers and help put this ballot-sword, forged in the workshop of right\r\nand justice, in the hand of every woman.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Mr. John Thomson Miss Neisser read Mr. Thomson's paper\r\non\r\n\r\n\r\n               HOW TO SECURE A STATE LIBRARY COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nI am asked \"How to secure a state library commission?\" I answer:\r\n\r\n_Ask for it._\r\n\r\n_Urge it on the legislature._\r\n\r\n_Strive persistently._\r\n\r\nWithout these three methods, there is little hope of getting a library\r\ncommission or the passage of good library legislation.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania has been behind every other state in the Union in the\r\nmatter of library legislation and principally because hardly any effort\r\nwas made to procure the assistance of the legislature. Outside of a\r\ndog-tax paid over for the support and maintenance of public libraries,\r\nunder an act approved in May, 1887, no real step was taken in this state\r\nto secure the benefits of the public library movement until 1895. In\r\nthat year, it was sought to pass an act to authorize all cities and\r\nboroughs of the commonwealth to levy taxes and make appropriations for\r\nthe establishment and maintenance of free libraries. Unfortunately, this\r\nbill was stoutly opposed and was finally amended so as to affect only\r\ncities of the first class. The most important subsequent legislation was\r\nthe approval by the governor in May, 1899, of a bill providing for the\r\nappointment of a free library commission and defining its powers and\r\nduties. Under this act, the governor had power to appoint five persons,\r\nwho with the state librarian, constitute the free library\r\ncommission--the state librarian being _ex officio_ secretary of that\r\nbody. The commission has power to give advice and counsel to all free\r\nlibraries in the state and to all communities which may propose to\r\nestablish them, as to the best means of establishing and administering\r\nsuch libraries, the selection of books, cataloging, and other details of\r\nlibrary management; and the commission has certain powers of general\r\nsupervision and inspection. The section closes with the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The commission shall also establish and maintain out of such sums as\r\nshall come into their hands, by appropriation or otherwise, a system of\r\ntravelling libraries as far as possible throughout the commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nLegislature adjourned without making any appropriation and the\r\ncommission found itself in the position described by Dickens when Mr.\r\nPickwick and his friends were authorized to travel where they liked,\r\nmake such investigations as they thought good, and generally to promote\r\nscience at their own expense. The commission was authorized under the\r\npowers conferred upon it to purchase books, provide book-cases, print\r\nwhatever matter seemed good to it, and generally develop a travelling\r\nlibraries system throughout Pennsylvania _at its own expense_. Nothing\r\ndaunted, the members of the commission met in the state library on April\r\n25, 1900 and organized, and being absolutely without funds, efforts were\r\nmade to secure contributions from benevolent friends of the movement and\r\n$2800 were raised from 29 persons who generously placed in the hands of\r\nthe commission sufficient funds to enable it to start the work. In a\r\nrecent circular issued by the commission, the secretary calls attention\r\nto the fact that Ohio already had more than 800 travelling libraries and\r\nan appropriation of $5000 per year with which to carry on the work.\r\nMichigan has many libraries and an appropriation of from three to five\r\nthousand dollars per year. Wisconsin has six or seven hundred travelling\r\nlibraries, and New York nearly one thousand. Every state of any\r\nimportance in the Union has established and is maintaining travelling\r\nlibraries on from three to five thousand dollars per annum. A few\r\ntravelling libraries only at present have been sent out in Pennsylvania.\r\nThese are now in use, but the commission was afraid to undertake much\r\nwork, as it did not know how soon its funds might be exhausted, and it\r\nmight find itself unable to grant the applications for travelling\r\nlibraries which are steadily coming in.\r\n\r\nWhen it is asked how to secure a state library commission the second\r\nquestion how to secure an appropriation with which to carry on the work\r\nof the commission is necessarily involved. In the case of Pennsylvania\r\n(just brought to a happy issue,) the active interest of many of the\r\nleading newspapers throughout the state was sought and obtained. The\r\neditors of these papers were written to in person and a statement\r\ndescribing the scope and needs of the library commission and the amount\r\nof the appropriation hoped for was forwarded to each. With one or two\r\nexceptions, the editors printed much of this material as news, and a\r\nconsiderable number added editorials urging the importance of the\r\nmovement. More valuable help could not have been secured. The smaller\r\npapers, which of course draw their material largely from the papers\r\npublished in the larger cities, followed suit, and practically reprinted\r\nthe same matter. Copies of the papers containing these articles were\r\nsecured, and marked copies were sent to the representatives from their\r\nown neighborhoods. In this manner nearly three hundred of the newspapers\r\nthroughout the state were communicated with, and their assistance had a\r\ngreat deal to do with the final granting of the appropriation. In this\r\nway information was laid before thousands of citizens who would\r\notherwise have been uninformed on the matter. Beyond all this an\r\nexplanatory letter fully detailing the position of the commission was\r\nsent by one of the commission to every member of the legislature and the\r\nsecretary of the commission issued the excellently prepared circular\r\n(above referred to), several copies of which were sent to every member\r\nof the legislature and to others. The result has been that an\r\nappropriation of $3500 has been passed by both houses, and there is no\r\nreason to doubt that the bill will receive the governor's signature when\r\nthe time comes for him to sign the appropriation bills for 1901-1902.\r\n\r\nIt would be waste of time at a round table meeting like this to dwell\r\nupon the benefits of the travelling libraries movement. The free library\r\ncommission of Pennsylvania has determined to do its utmost to develop\r\nthe movement throughout the state, and if a practical answer is to be\r\ngiven to the question, How to secure a state library commission?, I\r\nwould say, Recognize the importance of the movement, strive early and\r\nlate, through the newspapers, by means of circulars and by personal\r\ninterviews, to interest the members of the legislature, and persevere\r\nunintermittingly in impressing your needs upon those who have the power\r\nto grant the necessary legislation and appropriation. Work early and\r\nlate and do not stop working until you have secured what you want.\r\n\r\nMrs. BELLE M. STOUTENBOROUGH spoke on\r\n\r\n\r\n     WHAT WOMEN'S CLUBS CAN DO TO FURTHER THE WORK OF THE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\nI trust you will pardon me for adding the word \"Nebraska\" to my topic.\r\nSix years ago last October the Nebraska Federation of Women's Clubs held\r\nits second annual meeting at our state capital. Some two weeks before\r\nthe meeting Mrs. Peabody, a name familiar to every librarian in this\r\nroom, who was at that time our president, wrote me: \"I am very anxious\r\nto bring the travelling library movement before the women of our state.\r\nWill you talk for 15 or 20 minutes on this topic before the Lincoln\r\nmeeting?\" If she had asked me to talk on the study of comparative\r\nanatomy, I should have been just as familiar with the topic, but in the\r\nreference room of the Omaha Public Library, I held a consultation with\r\nPoole's index, and succeeded in finding just one article on travelling\r\nlibraries; it was in the January _Forum_ of 1895, and if I am not\r\nmistaken, it was a brief history or sketch of the traveling library\r\nmovement in New York. Here was my opportunity; what had been done in New\r\nYork, could be done in Nebraska, although upon a smaller scale, by the\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs. I shall not forget how I trembled as I\r\nstood before that large audience and made my first plea for a travelling\r\nlibrary. However, the secretary, in reporting the meeting, was kind\r\nenough to say that the audience at once caught the speaker's enthusiasm,\r\nand a committee was appointed for the formation of plans for a\r\nfederation travelling library. A hundred dollars was subscribed, and\r\nsixty books purchased and sent out to eight clubs that first year. I\r\nknow it seems like a small beginning to-day, but it was serious,\r\nearnest, and full of possibilities, and to-day the work is an\r\neducational factor in our state. I believe that these books which have\r\ngone out to the club women have not only enabled them to pursue certain\r\nlines of study, which otherwise it would not have been possible for them\r\nto have taken, but they have created in the minds of other members of\r\nthe family a desire to possess good reference books. These books are\r\nsent out from my own home. The clubs receiving them are at no expense\r\nexcept in paying express charges for their return. The work is supported\r\nby voluntary contributions, and as to the salary of the librarian, she\r\nis paid over and over again in the thankful letters which she receives\r\nfrom the people who are using the books.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, the Nebraska Library Association succeeded in introducing a\r\nbill in the legislature, creating a library commission for travelling\r\nlibraries. It passed the lower house, and went into the senate, where it\r\nwas \"lost to sight, though to memory dear.\" In 1899, nothing daunted,\r\nthe Nebraska Library Association was there again with its library bill.\r\nIt passed the lower house, but it never reached the senate. Last June,\r\nthe National Federation of Women's Clubs was held in the city of\r\nMilwaukee. Mrs. Buchwalter, of Ohio, the chairman of the program\r\ncommittee, planned for a bureau of library instruction or information,\r\nand this bureau was located in an upper room in the Milwaukee Public\r\nLibrary. The presiding genius in the room was Miss Stearns; I always\r\nthink of her as the pioneer travelling library woman of the northwest. A\r\nclubwoman from Nebraska was in attendance at that meeting and instead of\r\nspending her time listening to the program, she passed the greater part\r\nof the week in that upper room, and there she learned the work which is\r\nbeing done by women's clubs throughout the length and breadth of our\r\nland in this library field, and she went back to Nebraska determined, if\r\npossible, to secure legislation for free travelling libraries in the\r\ncoming year. It was a strange coincidence, that last October the\r\nNebraska Federation of Women's Clubs again held their annual meeting at\r\nour state capital, and as before, the same woman who had presented six\r\nyears before to that meeting, a plan for a Federation travelling\r\nlibrary, was there to present a plan for free travelling libraries and a\r\nstate library commission for Nebraska. The plan was formally and\r\nunanimously adopted, and a committee was appointed to co-operate with\r\nthe Nebraska Library Association to secure legislation. In all this\r\nwork, we never had any one who assisted us more ably than Mr. Wyer, the\r\nlibrarian of the state university, who was never too busy to advise us\r\nor to see a man that we could not reach, and he it was who drafted our\r\nbill and saw it through. To make a long story short, the first thing we\r\ndid was to send out circulars suggesting that \"a library day\" be\r\nobserved in the clubs; this library day was generally discussed\r\nthroughout the state. Then we sent a petition which was circulated, not\r\nonly in the towns, but among the farmers and their wives; and finally\r\none March morning I received the following telegram: \"Rejoice and be\r\nexceeding glad\"--and I have been rejoicing ever since, for house bill\r\nno. 20, carrying with it an appropriation of $4000 for free public\r\nlibraries, for free travelling libraries, and for the state commission,\r\nhad passed, not only the lower house, but the senate. It received the\r\ngovernor's signature, and it means we are to have travelling libraries\r\nin Nebraska.\r\n\r\nMiss FREEMAN: Mrs. Morris, of the Wisconsin Free Library Commission and\r\nthe General Federation of Women's Clubs, will be unable to be with us\r\nthis morning on account of illness. We are, however, fortunate in being\r\nable to hear from Mrs. Youmans, the president of the Wisconsin\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs.\r\n\r\nMrs. YOUMANS: I cannot possibly fill Mrs. Morris' place, but I should\r\nnot like to have this subject discussed without Wisconsin being\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nWe may gather from the deliberations of this association, that Wisconsin\r\nkeeps a prominent place in library work among the states of the Union.\r\nIf this is so, and I do not doubt it, it is, as we all know, due to the\r\nenthusiasm and energetic efforts of the Free Library Commission, and\r\nthis commission will assure you that its members have had no more\r\nenthusiastic allies than the club women of the state. Work for libraries\r\nwas the first work undertaken by Wisconsin women's clubs--the first work\r\noutside of their regular literary programs--and since the organization\r\nof the federation in 1896, it has been one of its most prominent lines\r\nof work. I suppose there are few clubs among the 150 in the federation\r\nthat have not done something, sometimes important and sometimes\r\nunimportant, for the library movement. They have established libraries\r\nand free reading-rooms; they have helped to support libraries; they\r\nhave made donations of books and money; they have sent out travelling\r\nlibraries on their errands of usefulness; and they have also sent out\r\ntravelling reference libraries especially for the uses of the study\r\nclubs. The federation at the present time is making a special effort\r\ntoward securing as many of these travelling reference libraries as\r\npossible. The club women in the interior of the state have very\r\ninadequate reference facilities; we have now only six or seven of these\r\nreference libraries, and we feel comparatively rich that we are soon to\r\nhave half a dozen more.\r\n\r\nA great many of the public libraries in Wisconsin are due directly to\r\nefforts of club women. The public library of Waukesha is due directly to\r\nthe efforts of a little coterie of club women; they started seven years\r\nago, with prospects that could not possibly be called brilliant. They\r\nkept the library going for seven years from one month to another, in\r\nsome way securing the money, and finally the burden was taken from their\r\nshoulders by the city council. Now, the library is not large; it is not,\r\nfrom a technical point of view, fine; and it certainly lacks many things\r\nthat we hope to have in the future; but it has 2500 volumes, generally\r\nread and much valued by the people, it has become established as a\r\nregular necessary part of the municipal life, and I think it is sure of\r\na regular though moderate support from the public funds. In a city a few\r\nmiles north of here a woman's club has a fund of $500 towards a library\r\nbuilding. It does not intend building a library with that sum; it does\r\nnot intend to go on earning money by rummage sales and private\r\ntheatricals; but it does expect to use that money and to use the\r\ninterest of the members of the club as a center for developing library\r\ninterests in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nThis work is illustrative of what is being done all over the state, and\r\nit is not so much the money that the club women collect for the\r\nlibraries, nor the books they may secure, nor even the direct work that\r\nthey do; it is the feeling that they disseminate as to the value of\r\npublic libraries. The club woman, in her club work, finds the need of a\r\ngood library; her associations and connections are such that she learns\r\nto value books more than she ever did before; she learns, too, that for\r\nthe intellectual life of her vicinity it is necessary to have a public\r\nlibrary; she helps to develop the public spirit that demands a public\r\nlibrary; she helps to bring out an atmosphere in which public libraries\r\ngerminate and grow and flourish. This, it seems to me, is the most\r\nimportant part of club work among club women. This is what they are\r\ndoing in Wisconsin, and what they will continue to do.\r\n\r\nMr. HUTCHINS: I have been watching for years the work of the women's\r\nclubs and their enthusiasm for libraries. They are accomplishing a great\r\ndeal, and there is just one thing I would like to say to the club women\r\nof the country, \"Plan a study club, and in a few years you get a public\r\nlibrary. Plan a library, and in a few years you get five study clubs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n CO-OPERATION BETWEEN A. L. A. AND GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMEN'S CLUBS.\r\n\r\nMiss STEARNS: The American Library Association has fallen into a most\r\nsuccessful alliance with the National Educational Association, as is\r\ndemonstrated by the continuation of our meeting at Detroit. Now, the A.\r\nL. A. has never realized all that the General Federation of Women's\r\nClubs has done for the promotion of library interests. This is the first\r\ntime in the history of the A. L. A. that the women's clubs have been\r\nrecognized on our program, and I move that the A. L. A. Council be\r\nrequested to form an alliance between the American Library Association\r\nand the Federation of Women's Clubs for the promotion of library\r\ninterests. _Voted._\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Miss MARIE S. DUPUIS, the chairman read by title her\r\npaper on\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE WOMAN'S CLUB AND THE TRAVELLING LIBRARY.\r\n\r\nThe woman's club and the travelling library seem made for each other. So\r\nperfectly does the travelling library supply a suitable channel for the\r\nenergies of the woman's club, and so admirably does the woman's club\r\nseem fitted for the work of sending out travelling libraries, that the\r\none seems the natural and perfect complement of the other.\r\n\r\nWhat a box of well-selected reading matter means to a rural community\r\nprobably only those know who have lived in a rural community without\r\nthe box. Others must draw upon their imaginations to picture farm homes\r\nwithout other current literature than a weekly local paper whose \"patent\r\ninside\" contains all the news they receive of the world's work; homes\r\nwhere the family Bible--not always present--and the children's school\r\nbooks form the only bound volumes of the family library, where even the\r\ndeservedly ephemeral literature of the daily paper and the 10-cent\r\nmagazine are unknown, though rural free mail delivery will soon alter\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWith numberless such communities on the one hand, we have on the other\r\nnumerous women's clubs organized for self-improvement and \"mutual aid,\"\r\nto use the fine phrase of Prince Kropotkin. And so closely are human\r\ninterests interwoven that \"mutual aid\" means self-improvement, and\r\nself-improvement \"mutual aid.\" It is doubtful if any form of educational\r\nendeavor undertaken by women's clubs is so fruitful in good results as\r\nthe travelling library. It is the most practical form of educational\r\nwork as yet undertaken by these organizations. The work of the Illinois\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs in this direction has been under the\r\nsupervision of the library extension committee of that organization.\r\nMore than one-third of the clubs of the state are now engaged in\r\ntravelling library work. The number of libraries in circulation has\r\ndoubled in the past year.\r\n\r\nThe plan usually adopted in the formation of a travelling library is for\r\neach member of a club to donate one or more books. A Parmelee or other\r\nsuitable trunk bookcase is purchased for the collection, usually\r\nconsisting of about 50 volumes, a record-book is provided, each volume\r\nis furnished with a library catalog and the rules for borrowers\r\nrecommended by the committee, and the library is then ready to begin its\r\ntravels.\r\n\r\nSeveral libraries are grouped into county circuits--a unique feature of\r\nthe Illinois plan--of four or more to a circuit. Two years has been\r\nfound to be the average life of a travelling library, and a circuit of\r\nfour libraries remaining in each community for six months will thus\r\nsupply four communities with travelling libraries for two years.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the composition of the travelling library, the committee\r\nrecommends that each library consist of about 50 volumes; that of these\r\none-half shall be juveniles; that fiction shall be carefully selected,\r\npreference being given to standard works, those which have stood the\r\ntest of time; that everything of a theological bias shall be excluded;\r\nthat biographies, travels and nature studies and stories are\r\nparticularly desirable, with other suggestions for particular\r\ncommunities or of a general character. We lay particular stress upon the\r\nproportion of juveniles being at least one-half, for the reason not only\r\nthat children and young people are generally the most numerous class of\r\nreaders, but also because many adults, unaccustomed to much reading,\r\nfind juvenile literature more readily comprehensible. Considering the\r\nfact that our libraries are almost wholly the result of voluntary\r\ndonation, it is remarkable and, indeed, extremely gratifying that the\r\nlibraries sent out are of such a high degree of literary excellence. The\r\noutcome of the heterogeneous tastes of club members, they seem admirably\r\nadapted to the equally heterogeneous tastes of the communities to which\r\nthey are sent. Improvement, however, is always possible, and for the\r\ncoming year we have model lists of books drawn up as guides, if not\r\npatterns, for future libraries.\r\n\r\nIn states where a public travelling library system does not yet exist,\r\nthe women's clubs seem excellently qualified for inaugurating and\r\nmaintaining such a system until the time comes, as it surely will, when\r\nevery state has its library commission and its travelling library fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TRUSTEES' SECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA meeting of the Trustees' Section of the A. L. A. was held on July 6 in\r\nparlor C of the Fountain House, with Dr. Leipziger in the chair and\r\nThos. L. Montgomery acting as secretary. There were 75 persons present.\r\nDr. Leipziger made an opening address, outlining the work that might be\r\ndiscussed by the section.\r\n\r\nMr. Soule urged the election of trustees for a term of years only, and\r\nin the opinion of those present three years seemed the proper limit.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether members of the board of education should be\r\nadmitted to library boards excited considerable discussion, in which Mr.\r\nCooke, of Iowa, Mr. Porter, of Cincinnati, Mr. Crunden and the secretary\r\ntook part. It was generally conceded that members of the board of\r\neducation should not be trustees of libraries _ex officio_, but that\r\nthere was no objection to electing them as individuals.\r\n\r\nMr. EASTMAN then read his very interesting paper on\r\n\r\n                           LIBRARY BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 38.)\r\n\r\nMr. MAURAN, of St. Louis, spoke on\r\n\r\n            THE RELATION OF THE ARCHITECT TO THE LIBRARIAN.\r\n\r\n                             (_See_ p. 43)\r\n\r\nMr. Patton, of Chicago, said that the two papers showed the lack of any\r\nantagonism between the professions. He considered it absolutely\r\nnecessary that the architect should be selected before anything else, in\r\norder that he should be familiar with all the librarians' requirements,\r\nand that the interior arrangement was the only matter that should be\r\nthought of then. The plan of giving premiums is bad, because it is no\r\ntemptation to the skilled architect, but it is to the mere draughtsman.\r\nHe also thought that library architecture must become a specialty.\r\n\r\nMr. Dewey asked, \"What is the best way to get the combined judgment of\r\nseveral architects without offence to the profession, and yet give a\r\nproper remuneration for their labor?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Patton answered that there was no objection to such consultations on\r\nthe part of the profession, and that it was becoming more common every\r\nyear. The objection to competitions was that there was no expert to make\r\na fair decision. Competitions, as a rule, did not produce such good\r\nresults as the appointment of a well-equipped and competent architect,\r\nto plan and oversee the work from the beginning. Under any circumstances\r\nexpert advice might be had and should generally prove useful, especially\r\nwhen members of a library board were not prepared to give thorough\r\nattention to the architectural problems. Personally, he had often been\r\nemployed as consulting architect, just as a physician might be called in\r\nthat capacity.\r\n\r\nMr. Eastman stated that in the case of the Utica Public Library $150 had\r\nbeen given to each of ten architects for small sketches or outlines\r\nincorporating the requirements of the board.\r\n\r\nMr. Dewey thought that every state commission should have an expert, to\r\nwhom should be referred all suggestions for plans for libraries, in\r\norder that the bad features may be called to the attention of the\r\nlibrary board. In the case of very large institutions the national\r\nlibrary should be appealed to.\r\n\r\nThis was by far the most interesting meeting that has been held by the\r\nsection, and the interest taken in the discussion promises well for the\r\nfuture meetings.\r\n\r\nDr. Leipziger declining to serve as chairman, and the secretary having\r\ndeclined the nomination, Mr. D. B. Corey was elected chairman and T. L.\r\nMontgomery secretary for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n                                    THOMAS L. MONTGOMERY, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION IN BIBLIOGRAPHY: ROUND TABLE MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn informal \"round table\" meeting for the consideration of present and\r\npossible methods of professional instruction in bibliography, was held\r\non the morning of Monday, July 10, in one of the parlors of the Fountain\r\nSpring House. A. G. S. JOSEPHSON was chairman, and J. I. WYER, Jr.,\r\nacted as secretary.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m. by Mr. JOSEPHSON, who\r\nopened the session with a paper on\r\n\r\n\r\n                A POST-GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the various definitions of the word bibliography, I have\r\nfound two main groups, one narrow, one broad.\r\n\r\nThe narrow definition has been thus expressed by Prof. C V. Langlois:\r\n\"Bibliography is the science of books. As library economy treats of the\r\nclassification, the exterior description of books, of the organization\r\nand history of libraries; as bibliography treats of the history of the\r\nbook as a manufactured product (printing, bookbinding, bookselling); so\r\nbibliography in the precise meaning of the word, is that particular part\r\nof the science of the book which treats of the repertories and which\r\nprovides the means of finding, as promptly and as completely as\r\npossible, information in regard to sources.\"\r\n\r\nAs an example of the broad definitions I choose the one by M. E. Grand\r\nin \"La grande encyclopédie\" He defines bibliography as \"the science of\r\nbooks from the point of view of their material and intellectual\r\ndescription and classification,\" and goes on to say that \"there are\r\nthree principal things to be considered in the study of bibliography:\r\nclassification of books, ... (_bibliographical systems_); description of\r\nbooks (_bibliographical rules_); and the use of _bibliographical\r\nrepertories_.\"\r\n\r\nIf we compare these two definitions we see that here the same word has\r\nbeen used for two distinct subjects, the one of which includes the\r\nother. Without here going deeper into the intricacies of these\r\ndefinitions, I will, for the purpose of this discussion, accept the\r\nbroader of the two.\r\n\r\nThe question what instruction in bibliography should contain is already\r\nanswered in the above definition itself.\r\n\r\nThe study of _bibliographical systems_ for classification of books\r\npresupposes the study of the theoretical systems of classification of\r\nknowledge and this presupposes the study of the history of the sciences.\r\n\r\n_Bibliographical rules_ govern the practical art of book description,\r\nwhat is technically known as cataloging. There are various codes of\r\nrules, more or less arbitrary, as they are more or less the outcome of a\r\ncompromise. But under all arbitrariness one will discern some underlying\r\ntheory as to what a description of a book should contain. Such theories\r\nare founded on the practice of printing and publishing: thus the\r\nintelligent study of bibliographical rules presupposes the study of the\r\nhistory of printing and publishing.\r\n\r\n_Bibliographical repertories_ contain the systematic records of printed\r\ndocuments and the study of these repertories is what is called\r\nbibliography in the narrow sense. While the branches of study previously\r\nreferred to may by some be regarded as of less value to the librarian\r\nthere is surely none who will deny the necessity of his being thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the literature of bibliographical repertories. However, I\r\ndo not think that I am alone in the contention that all the different\r\nbranches of bibliography in the broader sense are of the utmost\r\nimportance to the librarian.\r\n\r\nDr. Dziatzko has pointed out that in such an eminently practical\r\noccupation as that of the librarian it is particularly important not to\r\nneglect altogether some kind of theoretical studies. There can be no\r\nstudies of greater importance to the librarian than those just\r\nenumerated, namely, history of literature--the word taken in its\r\nbroadest sense--history of the book in all its phases, and the study of\r\nbibliographical literature.\r\n\r\nThe library schools have done much to encourage the professional spirit\r\nof librarians and to develop the technical side of their work. It is,\r\nhowever, felt that something more is needed, something that a\r\nprofessional school or a training class cannot give, namely, solid\r\nbibliographical scholarship. This can, in my opinion, not be acquired\r\nexcept at a university with a faculty of specialists and an extensive\r\nequipment of bibliographical literature as a part of a large university\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nA post-graduate school of bibliography, such as I have in mind should\r\noffer instruction to two classes of students. The one class would be\r\nstudents in the other branches of instruction who would select as a\r\nminor one of the subjects offered by the school, and who should be\r\nrequired to pursue in the school the bibliographical study of their main\r\ntopics and the preparation of the bibliographies that should be required\r\nas a necessary accompaniment to every dissertation. The other class\r\nwould consist of persons wishing to prepare themselves for the\r\nprofessional work of the librarian and bibliographer. They would choose\r\nas their majors the studies offered at this school, and could choose as\r\na minor any other scholastic subject. It would be of great importance to\r\nthe would-be librarian, could he, while pursuing his special studies, be\r\nallowed to do university work in some other subject of his choice, such\r\nas literary history, philosophy, American history, mathematics, or the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nAs thorough bibliographical knowledge is the foundation for the work of\r\nthe librarian, the central subject of instruction in the school should\r\nbe the study of bibliographical repertories and of the record\r\nliterature. This study should include seminar work in the handling of\r\nliterary tools, in hunting up references on special questions, and in\r\nthe preparation of bibliographical lists. This leads to the study of\r\nbibliographical methods. The principles of book description should be\r\ndiscussed, the leading codes of rules studied comparatively, their\r\nmerits and defects discussed, but none should be taught as the one to be\r\nabsolutely followed.\r\n\r\nHistory of printing and bookselling comes next, preceded by an\r\nintroductory consideration of palæography, particularly that of the 15th\r\ncentury. The steps leading to the discovery of printing with movable\r\ntypes, and the spread of the art over the world should be followed.\r\nExamples of the products of the first printing presses should be studied\r\nand described. Of later periods in the history of the book the most\r\nimportant seem to be the later 16th and the 17th centuries in England,\r\nand the 19th century in Germany.\r\n\r\nA parallel study with that of the history of printing might be\r\nclassification of knowledge and of books, with the history of science.\r\nThe student might well be given his choice between these two topics,\r\nwhile that of bibliography in its narrower sense should be required of\r\neveryone. The history and interrelation of the various sciences is a\r\nsubject of great importance not only to the classifier, but to the\r\nlibrary administrator in general. It should be covered by special\r\nlectures by the representatives of the various sciences, connected by a\r\ntheoretical course in the theory of classification, and followed by\r\nseminar work in classification of books.\r\n\r\nA course preparing for the professional work of librarianship cannot be\r\ncomplete without the study of library administration. While we are not\r\nparticularly concerned with this to-day, it should be said that this\r\nsubject would naturally be a required one, and would cover particularly\r\nthe history of libraries and of the methods of library administration.\r\nThe technical training in the minor topics of library economy would not\r\nhave any place in a school of this description.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to be able to present at this meeting some statements from\r\nuniversity authorities in regard to the establishment of a post-graduate\r\nschool of bibliography at some university. I have not, however,\r\nsucceeded in getting any statement of such definiteness that I can\r\npresent it here. I can only say that the president of one of the larger\r\nwestern universities seems to look with some interest on the\r\nproposition. A letter from Dr. W. T. Harris, Commissioner of Education,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"It is very easy for me to say that I believe post-graduate courses in\r\nbibliography to be a most excellent thing, but whether there should be\r\nsuch a school established in Washington--I have no conviction on this\r\nquestion. I am not in a condition to say whether it would not be a most\r\nexcellent thing to establish such a school in connection with the\r\nLibrary of Congress. Mr. Putnam is proceeding in a very intelligent\r\nmanner to make the Congressional Library of use to the whole country.\r\nWould not a school of bibliography here in Washington have the best\r\nopportunity to do, so to speak, laboratory work in bibliography, and\r\nthis in connection with the national library? I am not able to affirm an\r\nopinion on this question. The subject is very important and your letter\r\nwas a letter which I wished to answer to some purpose, but I have not\r\nbeen able to do it, and this is merely an explanation of why I have not\r\nbeen able to do it.\r\n\r\n \"You very well name the studies of such a school: The literature of the\r\n subject; the use and handling of books as literary aids;\r\n bibliographical methodology; comparative history of literature and the\r\n sciences; classification of knowledge accompanied by the study of the\r\n various systems of classification of books; palæography, history of\r\n printing.\r\n\r\n \"It seems to me that one-tenth of all the librarians educated for the\r\n purpose of working in a library should take just such a course of\r\n instruction as this. This would give them directive power in the most\r\n important part of the librarian's duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary read a paper by Dr. JOH. LECHE describing the\r\n\r\n\r\n COURSES IN BIBLIOGRAPHY OFFERED BY PROF. DZIATZKO AT THE UNIVERSITY OF\r\n                               GÖTTINGEN.\r\n\r\nThe first and so far the only professorship in the auxiliary sciences of\r\nlibrarianship in Prussia was founded in 1886 in Göttingen as a\r\nconsequence of the growing importance of libraries. This professorship\r\nhas been filled since its foundation by Professor Dr. Carl Dziatzko.\r\n\r\nThe courses of lectures given have so far been as follows:\r\n\r\n  Library administration.\r\n  The laws of authors and publishers in the history of bookselling.\r\n  Books in the Middle Ages.\r\n  (The above courses have not been given in later years.)\r\n  Books and writing in ancient times.\r\n  History of printing and bookselling:\r\n    (_a_) previous to the Reformation.\r\n    (_b_) since the Reformation.\r\n  History and development of modern librarianship.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are held three times a week and have the same strictly\r\nscientific character as other university studies.\r\n\r\nThey demand therefore real co-operation between lecturer and students,\r\nputting before the latter, as they do, a rich and critically sifted\r\nmaterial which gives them, in a way, a sharp outline only which they\r\nwill fill out more or less fully according to their diligence in\r\ncarrying on their studies. The lectures are made particularly attractive\r\nand stimulating through the exhibition of important examples of\r\nprinting, if possible original works referred to or quoted in the\r\nlectures, etc.\r\n\r\nBeside these public lectures, Prof Dziatzko gives once a week a\r\nbibliographical seminar for a smaller circle. The majority of the\r\nmembers of this seminar are the library volunteers who naturally are\r\nmore numerous in Göttingen than at other Prussian university libraries.\r\nIf it is true of the public lectures that valuable results are gained\r\nonly by real co-operation of the students, these seminars directly\r\ndemand independent work of the members. A considerable part, in fact\r\nhalf of the allotted time, is given to description of incunabula\r\naccording to the rules formulated by Prof. Dziatzko and published in no.\r\n10 of his \"Sammlung bibliothekswissenschaftlicher Arbeiten.\" Apart from\r\nthe importance of incunabula for the history of printing, they are\r\nparticularly suited to bring out questions of various kinds relating to\r\nbibliography and librarianship. The remaining seminar hours are given up\r\nto reviews and papers by the members. In most cases the subjects are\r\nselected at the suggestion of Prof. Dziatzko, but it is preferred that\r\nthe members should select their own topics. The papers deal with the\r\nmost varied subjects: questions of a purely practical nature alternate\r\nwith scientific and historical investigations of bibliographical topics.\r\n(Several of these papers have afterwards been prepared for publication\r\nin Prof. Dziatzko's \"Sammlung bibliothekswissenschaftlicher Arbeiten.\")\r\nThe papers are followed by judicious criticism by Prof. Dziatzko and\r\ndiscussion by the members of the seminar. Whatever time is left is\r\ndevoted to reading of old manuscripts, exhibition of bibliographical\r\nrarities and curiosities, important new publications, etc.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the palæographical studies just mentioned it should\r\nbe noted that a special seminar in palæography, given by another\r\nprofessor, Dr. Wilhelm Meyer, is attended by many as a supplement to\r\ntheir bibliographical studies.\r\n\r\nA. S. ROOT, librarian of Oberlin College, supplemented this letter with\r\na description of his work with Dr. Dziatzko, stating that the real\r\nstrength and power of the work consisted in the bibliographical seminar\r\nand the work with incunabula. In this work each student has assigned to\r\nhim the work of a special city or a special press. He studies the books,\r\ncatalogs them, and submits his work to Prof. Dziatzko for review. These\r\npapers are then discussed by the members of the seminar and sharply\r\ncriticised by Prof. Dziatzko. The new literature of bibliography added\r\nto the library is periodically examined and discussed by the class.\r\n\r\nG. W. HARRIS, librarian of Cornell University, gave in outline, the\r\nsubstance of a course of 15 lectures on bibliography, delivered one each\r\nweek during a half year at Cornell. The nature of these lectures is\r\ngeneral because in each department more or less stress is based on the\r\nuse of special bibliographies, and each thesis for an advanced degree at\r\nCornell must be accompanied by a satisfactory bibliography of the\r\nsubject treated. The large collection of early imprints representing\r\nmany of the different presses affords excellent opportunity to inspect\r\nand study examples of early printing. Mr. Harris was of the opinion that\r\nwork in the bibliography of special subjects should be given by the\r\nheads of the departments concerned. Mr. Harris gave the following\r\n\r\n\r\n       SYNOPSIS OF LECTURES ON BIBLIOGRAPHY, CORNELL UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n                                LECTURE.\r\n\r\n     I.

HASKINS, professor of European history in the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin, presented an outline of his\r\n\r\n\r\n      COURSE IN HISTORICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nMy standpoint is that of the user, not the custodian, of books, and of\r\nthe user of historical books in particular. There is no branch of\r\nknowledge more dependent upon bibliography than is history. The natural\r\nsciences, for example, get their bibliographies through current journals\r\nand their original materials in the laboratory, while the student of\r\nhistory must not only cover current literature thoroughly but is\r\nentirely dependent upon bibliographies to guide him to the primary\r\nsources of his subject of study. There is not as yet enough definite\r\ninstruction in historical bibliography offered in American universities;\r\nindeed, there is some vagueness as to just what historical bibliography\r\nis. In the work at Wisconsin the course is divided into two broad\r\nsections. The first half of the course is taken up with a general\r\naccount of the manuscript and printed collections of historical material\r\nin Europe and America. The second half begins with a description of the\r\nbibliographical tools which all students alike use, the national\r\nbibliographies, and the trade bibliographies of all the important\r\ncountries, and goes on to consider the bibliographical materials\r\npeculiar to history and of prime importance only to the historical\r\nstudent. In this connection especial stress is laid upon the historical\r\nperiodicals. The aim throughout the whole course is to indicate the\r\nnature and the range of historical material, where it is to be found,\r\nwhat and where are the sources, so that the student will come to know\r\nwhat he wants and where to find it. The course is given one hour each\r\nweek through a half year and is taken entirely by graduate students. The\r\nregistration is usually from 8 to 12. The work in the lectures is\r\nsupplemented by many references to articles and books. In the latter\r\npart of the course the \"Manuel de bibliographie historique\" of Langlois\r\nis used as a text in the hands of the students. The second edition of\r\nthis book, which is just out, forms an exceedingly satisfactory book for\r\nthis purpose, and is supplemented by informal comment and mention of\r\nadditional material. In this admirable little volume nothing of\r\nimportance is omitted and very little indeed which is unimportant is\r\nincluded. Very much is made of the actual handling of the books by the\r\nstudents. No regular system of practical exercises in connection with\r\nthis course has yet been worked out, but progress is being made in this\r\ndirection. The object is primarily to impress students with the\r\nimportance of the use of bibliographical tools. Considerable practice in\r\nthe use of bibliographies is also given in all the advanced courses in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn general I have found that much inconvenience both to students and\r\ninstructors results from the habit of secluding all the most important\r\nbibliographies in the catalog room. If it be true that these\r\nbibliographies are constantly needed in the catalog room, they should be\r\nduplicated for the use of the students. This practice of seclusion would\r\nnot be worth mention did it not seem to be habitual in almost all\r\nlibraries, and I wish here to register a special plea that\r\nbibliographies may be shelved just as publicly as any other section of\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\nI am much interested in Mr. Josephson's proposals for developing\r\nbibliographical instruction in universities. It seems to me he has taken\r\nhold of the matter by the right end, and the establishment of a course\r\nsimilar to that he suggests would not only be of value to future\r\nlibrarians by giving them wider opportunities for general training than\r\nthey can get in special schools, but would also prove helpful to\r\nadvanced students in all departments of study. I hope some university\r\nwill take the matter up. I am in sympathy with any instruction, formal\r\nor informal, which brings instructors and students to a better knowledge\r\nof how to use the library and the books.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COURSES AT OTHER COLLEGES.\r\n\r\nMr. ROOT gave in detail the work he is doing at Oberlin in this line. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\nWe offer at Oberlin a course in bibliography in each college year. The\r\nfirst year the work has to do with the use of libraries, with questions\r\nof classification and cataloging, and is designed to aid the new\r\nstudents in becoming familiar with the methods in use in our own library\r\nand also with accepted methods in all well-conducted libraries. The\r\ncourse in the second year has to do with the history of books and of\r\nprinting. This work is almost entirely historical. Some study is given\r\nto the process and history of binding, with examples of famous bindings.\r\nThe third year work deals with palæography and the history and\r\ndevelopment of handwriting, illumination, and work with manuscripts in\r\ngeneral. The fourth year work is in the nature of a seminar and is\r\ndevoted to instruction in bibliography. After an outline of the leading\r\nnational and trade bibliographies, problems in bibliography are handled\r\nand discussed. The courses fill half of the college year, one lecture\r\nper week being given. The work is entirely elective and the completion\r\nof all of it enables a student to elect one-eighth of his course in this\r\nsubject. I should be glad to see recognition by the leading library\r\nschools of this work, perhaps giving students advanced credit when work\r\nhas been satisfactorily done at any reputable college.\r\n\r\nWALTER M. SMITH, librarian of the University of Wisconsin, briefly\r\noutlined the elementary work done there with new students, and\r\nmaintained that formal lectures were not so good as practical\r\ninstruction in the use of the library both from the librarian's desk and\r\nfrom the reference desk.\r\n\r\nMiss SHARP, librarian of the University of Illinois, stated that a\r\none-hour course was given there for the general student body in the use\r\nof the library. Regular university credit is given, but students may\r\nattend these lectures optionally and many do so.\r\n\r\nANDREW KEOGH, of Yale University Library, described a short course in\r\nthe use of the library offered at that university. Two lectures are\r\ngiven, one in the class room and one in the library, accompanied with\r\nactual demonstration with the books. Some further and more elective work\r\nis given as graduate work at Yale, but the elementary work is compulsory\r\nwith all new students.\r\n\r\nA letter was read from Dr. H. P. TALBOT, of the Massachusetts Institute\r\nof Technology, giving full description of his\r\n\r\n\r\n                  COURSE IN BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nMy attempts to interest my students in books and bibliographies are\r\nbriefly these: For one term of 15 weeks of the junior year the students\r\nof the course in chemistry devote an hour each week (with two hours\r\nassigned for preparation) to practice in reading chemical German. The\r\nsubject matter assigned is either from some work on general or\r\nanalytical chemistry or from some current journal. Of late I have\r\nconfined myself mostly to a work on inorganic chemistry. The purpose\r\nhere is not at all to attempt to teach German, but to assist the\r\nstudents in acquiring a moderate facility in reading, that is,\r\nsufficient to enable them to get the _essentials_ from an article,\r\nrather than to make a finished translation.\r\n\r\nDuring the term following this, there is assigned to the class one or\r\nmore (usually two) topics, and they are required to prepare and submit\r\nfor inspection a bibliography of the journal literature upon these\r\nsubjects. This year the topic assigned to the whole class was the\r\n\"Determination of sulphur in irons and steels.\" The class (of 30) was\r\ndivided into squads, and to each squad a second topic was assigned, such\r\nas \"The use of sodium peroxide in analytical chemistry,\" \"The\r\npreparation and analysis of persulphuric acid and the persulphates,\"\r\n\"The recovery of molybdic acid from residues,\" etc.\r\n\r\nGeneral directions are given as to procedure in the compilation of the\r\nbibliography, the use of such periodicals as the _Centralblatt_ as a\r\nstarting point, and also the way to record and classify the references\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThis year we have used library cards for the recording of the references\r\nfor the first time, with marked success. Each card was to bear the\r\noriginal reference, the _Centralblatt_ or _Jahresbericht_ reference, the\r\ntitle of the article (if possible) and a very brief statement of its\r\ncontents. The cards were then to be grouped according to a\r\nclassification to be worked out by the student.\r\n\r\nEach student had finally about 200 cards, often with several references\r\non a card. They were allowed to divide the journals among the members of\r\na given squad, and to exchange cards.\r\n\r\nThe results are most satisfactory. The work has been well done as a\r\nwhole, and already I hear of resolves on their part to keep up a card\r\ncatalog of interesting articles, which is a promising symptom.\r\n\r\nEach year for some time, I have devoted a single hour near the close of\r\nthe year to a brief discussion of books, from the point of view of the\r\nneeds of a person desiring to collect a small library. In this\r\nconnection I have put into the students hands a list of \"Standard works\"\r\nciting the essential reference books on the subject, and have commented\r\nbriefly on the list. Please understand that this list is not by any\r\nmeans infallible, and that there are doubtless other works just as good\r\nas those mentioned.\r\n\r\nOur senior students are all required to compile a bibliography of the\r\nliterature of the subject chosen as a thesis, and to prepare a brief\r\nreview of all recorded work, before they can begin their investigation,\r\nand the way in which they attack this work seems to indicate that the\r\nfamiliarity with journals and methods gained in the work of the junior\r\nyear outlined above stands them in good stead.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the instruction in the history of chemistry, frequent\r\npreparation of memoirs and a study of works in this field is also\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe list of books referred to in Dr. Talbot's letter was divided under\r\nthe following heads: History of chemistry, Physiological chemistry,\r\nOrganic chemistry, Technical chemistry, Agricultural chemistry,\r\nAnalytical chemistry, Biography, Dictionaries, Tables, Dyeing, Foods,\r\nGeneral chemistry, Toxicology.\r\n\r\nJ. I. WYER, librarian of the University of Nebraska, outlined a course\r\nof 16 lectures which are given there during the first semester of every\r\nalternate year, embracing national and trade bibliography, reference\r\nbooks, and thorough drill in subject bibliography. The work is primarily\r\ngiven as part of the apprentices' training for the library, but is\r\nattended by advanced and graduate students in other departments.\r\nRegular university credit is given for the work.\r\n\r\nW. STETSON MERRILL, of the Newberry Library, read a paper, entitled\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A DESIDERATUM FOR LIBRARY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nAs I am desirous that you should apprehend precisely what it is that I\r\nam to suggest as a desideratum for the library schools, I will ask to be\r\npermitted to lead up to my point, rather than state it at the outset.\r\n\r\nWe are all of us daily impressed with the rapidity of change and\r\nenlargement in the arts, sciences and various achievements of knowledge\r\nto-day. In some departments, indeed, such as the natural sciences, we\r\nexpect the accepted opinions of one decade to give place to others in\r\nthe next decade. But we perhaps hardly realize that there is a similar\r\nprogress in the historical, sociological and religious sciences, and in\r\nthe fine arts. New facts are discovered, verdicts of history are\r\nreviewed, new schools of thought and methods of study are established;\r\nnew men, new theories, new things come up every year, almost every day.\r\n\r\nNow, a librarian is expected to bring the stores of knowledge to an\r\ninquiring public; to render available the resources of accumulated\r\nwisdom which but for him would be like gold hidden in the veins of the\r\nrock. To perform this function requires of course primarily a certain\r\namount of educational training. A library assistant should be at least a\r\nhigh school graduate; the librarian of a library of research should be a\r\ncollege bred man, as such collegiate training will be found to his own\r\nadvantage and to that of his library.\r\n\r\nBut how after all their training and preparation are librarians, library\r\nworkers or students of library science to keep abreast of the time? This\r\nis really the problem in what may be called the higher education of the\r\nlibrary profession. It may be thought that the reading of annual\r\ncyclopedias, periodicals and the latest treatises will suffice to keep\r\nmembers of the profession posted upon all subjects of importance. Yet a\r\nlittle consideration will show that by such means much time and labor\r\nare sacrificed. A library worker reads in such a case, not for general\r\ninformation, but to ascertain definite and pertinent facts of importance\r\nto him in his special field of work. What he wishes to know are indeed\r\nthe new discoveries, facts and opinions; viewed, however, not in\r\nthemselves as events in the progress of the sciences, but as bearing\r\nupon the classification and nomenclature of the respective sciences\r\nwhich treat of them, and upon the relations which those sciences bear to\r\nothers. He needs also an up-to-date acquaintance with the great men of\r\nthe time, not in a personal way, but through the contributions which\r\nthey have made to knowledge. Otherwise he will not discern the authority\r\nupon any given subject from a tyro or an ignoramus. A true knowledge of\r\nbibliography does not consist merely in knowing lists of books or in\r\nknowing where to find such lists. It implies an acquaintance with the\r\nrelative values of books as well.\r\n\r\nA thoroughly equipped reference attendant or cataloger should also be\r\nfamiliar with the shibboleths and theories of the schools and with the\r\nopinions of scholars upon questions of the day. Now how is he to learn\r\nall this? He cannot learn it before he begins to study library work,\r\nbecause it is a growing, living thing--this mass of current fact and\r\nopinion. Yet he has no time to master each science for himself, and in\r\nmerely cursory reading he will miss the point which is to be of most use\r\nto him in his particular line of work.\r\n\r\nI reply that he needs the spoken word of the expert, framed and directed\r\nto meet the special requirements of his case. The expert who knows his\r\nsubject in all its bearings can tell us at once just what we want to\r\nknow, if we have a chance to ask him.\r\n\r\nLet us have then before our library schools and--I may add also--our\r\nlibrary clubs and associations, periodical talks by specialists upon\r\ntheir respective subjects, presenting in a concise form the progress of\r\nthese sciences and arts with special reference to the needs of library\r\nworkers, as outlined above.\r\n\r\nSuch a presentation will enable the librarian, the reference attendant,\r\nthe cataloger or the classifier to perform his work with an assurance\r\nand a facility that can be acquired in no other way. He will be acting\r\nunder expert advice. The special points to be brought out will be\r\npresented to the lecturer beforehand; he will prepare his statement,\r\ndeliver it, and later answers inquiries which may have arisen. We all\r\nknow how much easier it is to ask somebody about something than it is to\r\nlook it up in some book. Let questions be noted as they occur and the\r\nclass be given a chance to ask them of an authority.\r\n\r\nThese lectures or talks need not and should not be confined to student\r\nclass rooms. Let them be public lectures which library workers outside\r\nthe school may attend upon payment of a small fee. The intrinsic\r\ninterest of a lecture upon some topic of the day whether literary,\r\nhistorical, political, or scientific, would attract in a way that a\r\ncourse upon pure bibliography can never do. As our library schools are\r\nso integrally a part, as a rule, of some system of collegiate\r\ninstruction, there should be no difficulty in securing the services of\r\ndifferent members of the faculty. I may repeat also that no more useful\r\nprogram of work for a library club during a season could be planned than\r\na course of just such talks as I have described. To tell the truth, the\r\nmatter of this paper first occurred to me in its bearings upon the work\r\nof library clubs. To them and to the directors of our library schools it\r\nis presented for their consideration.\r\n\r\nFollowing this the representatives of the various library schools were\r\nasked to describe the\r\n\r\n\r\n          WORK OFFERED IN BIBLIOGRAPHY AT THE LIBRARY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nMr. BISCOE described the work at Albany, running through two years, the\r\nfirst being taken up with trade bibliography and the second with\r\nreference work and subject bibliography. The large resources of the New\r\nYork State Library enable the students to see, study and use almost all\r\nbooks taken up and the work is accompanied with many problems. Further\r\nelective work is also offered to students desiring to specialize along\r\nthis line.\r\n\r\nMiss PLUMMER spoke for the Pratt Institute School. During the first year\r\na general course of instruction in bibliography is offered, beginning\r\nwith trade bibliography, students being referred to the leading works of\r\nreference in English, French and German through lectures and problems\r\ngiven during the year. Each student is required to prepare a reading\r\nlist on a selected subject, requiring considerable research work, which\r\nmust be satisfactory to the instructor. The leading national and subject\r\nbibliographies are included in the lectures, and the problems frequently\r\nrequire consultation of these. Ten lectures are given on the history of\r\nbooks and printing. This is merely an outline course offered partly that\r\nstudents may discover any latent inclination toward the historical\r\ncourse, that they may know there is that side to their work. \"In the\r\nspecial lessons in French and German cataloging which we expect to\r\nundertake this fall,\" she said, \"a study of foreign catalogs will be a\r\nprominent feature, and the students will collect for themselves a\r\nvocabulary of bibliographical terms in these languages. In the broad\r\nsense of the term bibliography, as we find it in the 'Century\r\ndictionary,' the subject is fairly well covered by the second year's\r\nhistorical course. Through the courtesy of the New York Public Library\r\nthe class has had opportunity to do most of its work at the Lenox\r\nLibrary where there is a fine collection of reference books. The course\r\nbegins with a study of reference books on the history of printing,\r\nbibliographies of the 15th century, etc., and books such as Hain,\r\nPanzer, etc., and the more general bibliographies, _e.g._, Brunet,\r\nGraesse. The history of bookmaking is studied from the period of the\r\nmanuscript through the 15th century, and some work with American and\r\nother books has been done each year. The materials used in the earliest\r\ntimes, the methods of production and the steps leading to the invention\r\nof printing are all treated. The history of printing is studied by\r\ncountry, town, and printer, chronologically, and a study of the types\r\nused by different printers is made. For practical work the class\r\ncatalogs 15th century books. The books used for consultation in this\r\ncourse have been very numerous, and perhaps a good working knowledge of\r\nthem has been the most important feature of the work. The class was not\r\nand could not be limited to books in English, but used and in part\r\ntranslated books of reference in foreign languages. In the work with\r\nmanuscripts the historical course depends upon instruction given by\r\nProf. Egbert, professor of Latin palæography of Columbia University, who\r\nhas made up a course especially adapted to the object of our work and to\r\nthe time we have to give. Twenty-three lectures, only a few of which are\r\ndevoted to the bibliography of the subject, comprise the instruction,\r\ntwo hours' work outside being necessary on each lecture. Much more is\r\nusually done by the students, who generally live in New York city while\r\ntaking the historical course. The study of successive handwritings and\r\nabbreviations as illustrated by blue-prints furnished by the professor,\r\nleads naturally to early printed books, whose types were modelled after\r\nthe handwriting of the period. Reports of the work of this class have\r\nbeen very satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER, of the Drexel Institute Library School, described a course\r\nof 15 lectures on the history of books and printing, given at her\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe lectures embrace the following subjects:\r\n\r\n   I. The development of language, oral and written. Ancient systems of\r\n       writing. Derivation of the English alphabet. The preservation of\r\n       literature. Earliest forms of permanent records, literature,\r\n       books, and libraries in the ancient civilizations of the east.\r\n\r\n  II. The literatures of Greece and Rome. The book in the classical age.\r\n       Alexandria as a literary center. Barbarian invasions of the Roman\r\n       Empire. Decline and extinction of ancient culture. Destruction of\r\n       books and libraries.\r\n\r\n III. The book in the Middle Ages. The preservation and the production\r\n       of books in the monasteries. Development of the illuminated\r\n       manuscript. The early Renascence in its relation to literature\r\n       and books.\r\n\r\n  IV. The later Renascence: revival of learning. Recovery of ancient\r\n       literature. Rome, Florence, and Venice as the centers of\r\n       activity. Multiplication of manuscripts. The formation of modern\r\n       libraries.\r\n\r\n   V. The art of engraving as the precursor of printing. The invention\r\n       and diffusion of printing. The chief centers and the great\r\n       masters of printing. The printed book and its influence upon\r\n       civilization.\r\n\r\n  VI. Book illustration in ancient, medieval, and modern times.\r\n\r\n VII. Books and libraries in Europe and the United States. Types of\r\n       modern public libraries.\r\n\r\nVIII. Makers and lovers of books, and their libraries.\r\n\r\nMiss SHARP told of the instruction in bibliography given to the students\r\nin University of Illinois Library School by the professors at the\r\nuniversity. Several of the professors give lectures on the bibliography\r\nof their various subjects; a subject is assigned to the students before\r\nthe lecture, they are required to examine bibliographies, reviews, and\r\nthe books themselves, as far as accessible in the library, and to select\r\nten books which they would buy first for a library of 10,000 vols. This\r\nselection is criticised by the professor, who meets the class, gives\r\nthem an outline of his subject, speaks of the principles of selection,\r\nmentions the writers who are considered authorities, and calls to the\r\nattention of the students valuable material not to be found in the trade\r\nlists. This is in the first year; in the second year the professors give\r\ntheir lectures first and the class will select their books for criticism\r\nafterwards. The professors have given most generous co-operation in the\r\nwork; but their work has been uneven and many of them fail to catch the\r\nlibrarian's and bibliographer's point of view, and most of them\r\nacknowledge that their studies are limited to the advanced works, so\r\nthat they do not know what to recommend for the small public libraries.\r\n\r\nAn interesting discussion followed as to the relation between university\r\nlibrarians and professors in mutual co-operation in bibliographical\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nMiss KROEGER suggested that library students who felt a special\r\ninclination for some scholastic subject might take up such study as a\r\nsupplement to the library school course.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. HASKINS remarked that the proper way would rather be the\r\nopposite, namely that the student of history, for example, who wished to\r\ntake up library work, might take a course in library economy as a\r\nsupplement to his university studies. He pointed out that a university\r\ngraduate did not at all need to spend two years in getting familiar with\r\nlibrary technique.\r\n\r\nMr. HANSON, of the Library of Congress, Mr. ANDREWS, of The John Crerar\r\nLibrary, and Miss CLARK, of the Department of Agriculture Library at\r\nWashington, all emphasized the need of scientific experts who should\r\nalso be trained in bibliography and library economy. The opinion was\r\nstrongly expressed that there was no greater desideratum in instruction\r\nin library work at present than a course offered to trained scientists\r\nwho would be willing to add to their scientific training a fair\r\nknowledge of library methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              TRANSACTIONS OF COUNCIL AND EXECUTIVE BOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeetings of the Council of the American Library Association were held in\r\nconnection with the Waukesha conference, on July 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10, in\r\nall six sessions being held. There was also a short meeting of the\r\nexecutive board on July 9.\r\n\r\nOf the 25 members of Council 15 were present, as follows: C. W. Andrews,\r\nR. R. Bowker, W. H. Brett, H. J. Carr,[I] F. M. Crunden, J. C. Dana,\r\nMelvil Dewey, Electra C. Doren, W. I. Fletcher, J. K. Hosmer, George\r\nIles, Mary W. Plummer, Herbert Putnam, Katharine L. Sharp, Charles C.\r\nSoule. In addition, the members of the executive board served as _ex\r\nofficio_ members and officers of Council. They included the president,\r\nHenry J. Carr; ex-president, R. G. Thwaites; secretary, F. W. Faxon;\r\nrecorder, Helen E. Haines; treasurer, Gardner M. Jones. The first and\r\nsecond vice-president--E. C. Richardson and Mrs. Salome C.\r\nFairchild--were not present during the conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PROCEEDINGS OF COUNCIL.\r\n\r\n_Place of next meeting._ Invitations for the 1902 meeting of the\r\nAmerican Library Association were received from Detroit, Mich.;\r\nCharleston, S. C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Brevard, N. C.; from a New Hampshire\r\nBoard of Trade, suggesting a resort in the White Mountains, and from the\r\nMassachusetts Library Club, urging that the meeting be held on the\r\neastern coast, near Boston. It was _Voted_, That place and date of next\r\nmeeting be referred to the executive board, with recommendation to meet\r\nat a resort on the New England seaboard near Boston.\r\n\r\n_Nominations for officers._ It was _Voted_, That the ex-presidents\r\npresent at the meeting be appointed a committee to submit nominations\r\nfor officers for 1901-2. This committee reported at a later session of\r\nthe Council, and the nominations submitted were adopted, with the\r\nprovision that the ticket include also without distinction names sent in\r\non nominations signed by five members of the Association.\r\n\r\n_By-laws._ H. M. Utley, chairman of the Committee on By-laws, reported\r\nthe draft of by-laws prepared by that committee. This was discussed and\r\namended, each section being separately considered and voted upon. It was\r\n_Voted_, That the entire body of by-laws, as amended, be adopted,\r\nsubject to such arrangement of sections as may be made by the president\r\nand secretary.\r\n\r\nThe by-laws were later presented to the Association in general meeting.\r\n(_See_ Proceedings, p. 129.)\r\n\r\n_Endowment Fund and Publishing Board._ Charles C. Soule, trustee of the\r\nEndowment Fund, reported that the income of the fund now on hand and to\r\naccrue during the year amounted to about $1000, and recommended that the\r\nsum of $500 be added to the principal of the fund, unless required by\r\nthe Publishing Board or for other purposes of the Association.\r\n\r\nW. I. Fletcher, for the Publishing Board, stated that the board would\r\nneed during the ensuing year an appropriation as ample as could be\r\nsecured; and it was _Voted_:\r\n\r\nThat the trustees of the Endowment Fund be authorized to transfer to the\r\nPublishing Board the income of the Endowment Fund now on hand and to\r\naccrue during the coming year.\r\n\r\n_Reduced postal and express rates on library books._ Recommendations\r\nwere submitted from the Round Table Meeting on state library\r\ncommissions, as follows:\r\n\r\n1, That the Council be requested to arrange for securing reduced rates\r\nfrom the express companies for travelling libraries;\r\n\r\n2, That the Council be requested to give its support to the Jenkins bill\r\nproviding for the transmission of library books by rural free delivery;\r\n\r\n3, That the Council be requested to actively interest itself in securing\r\nlower postage rates on library books.\r\n\r\nAfter discussion it was _Voted_, That a committee of five of the Council\r\nbe appointed on express and postal rates for library books, to negotiate\r\nwith the express companies, to co-operate with regard to Congressional\r\nlegislation, and to report further to the Council as to the postal\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe committee was appointed as follows: E. H. Anderson, chairman; J. S.\r\nBillings, W. C. Lane, R. R. Bowker, Johnson Brigham. It was _Voted_:\r\n\r\nThat in case of the inability of any member of the committee to serve,\r\nthe retiring president be authorized to fill vacancies.\r\n\r\n_Relation of libraries to the book trade._ It was _Voted_, That the\r\nexecutive board be requested to appoint a committee of five to consider\r\nand report upon the relation of libraries to the book trade.\r\n\r\n_Cataloging rules for printed cards._ It was _Voted_, That the Council\r\nauthorize the promulgation of the proposed A. L. A. cataloging rules for\r\nprinted cards, so soon as the Publishing Board and its special advisory\r\ncommittee, and the Library of Congress, shall have agreed upon the\r\ndetails of same;\r\n\r\nThat the committee on cataloging rules for printed cards be requested\r\nalso to formulate the variations from those rules which they recommend\r\nfor manuscript work.\r\n\r\n_List of American dissertations._ The College and Reference Section\r\nsubmitted the following communication:\r\n\r\n\"_To the Council of the A. L. A._:\r\n\r\n\"The College and Reference Section, at its recent meeting, appointed the\r\nundersigned, a committee to prepare and report to the council the draft\r\nof a request with reference to an annual list of American dissertations\r\nfor the degree of doctor of philosophy or science. We would, therefore,\r\nrespectfully ask that the approval of the Council be given to the plan\r\noutlined herein, viz:\r\n\r\n\"To send to such institutions of learning in the United States and\r\nCanada as confer the degree of doctor of philosophy or science, after\r\nresidence and examination, the following circular letter:\r\n\r\n  \"_To the President and Faculty of ----_,\r\n\r\n \"GENTLEMEN: The College and Reference Section of the American Library\r\n Association, with the approval of the Council of such Association,\r\n respectfully requests that your institution publish in its annual\r\n catalog, or corresponding publication, a list of the dissertations\r\n accepted from persons who have been granted the degree of doctor of\r\n philosophy or science during the preceding academic year, and a\r\n supplementary list of all dissertations printed since the publication\r\n of the last annual catalog. This list should contain the following\r\n particulars: The full name and year of graduation of the author; the\r\n full title of the dissertation; the year of imprint, and, if a reprint,\r\n the title, volume, and pagination of the publication from which it was\r\n reprinted.\r\n\r\n \"We also request your institution to require a title-page for each\r\n dissertation, giving, in addition to the full name of author and title\r\n of dissertation, the year in which the degree was conferred, and in\r\n which the dissertation was printed, and, if a reprint, the title,\r\n volume and pagination of the publication where it was first printed.\r\n\r\n \"A compliance with these requests will be a most valuable service to\r\n the college and reference libraries of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe section further instructed us to suggest to the Council the\r\ndesirability of the compilation and publication of a complete list of\r\nsuch dissertations to July, 1900.\r\n\r\n                                      BERNARD C.

ANDREWS, }\r\n\r\nIt was _Voted_,\r\n\r\nThat the circular letter prepared by the Committee of\r\nthe College and Reference Section be approved, and that the executive\r\nboard authorize the necessary slight expense of printing and postage\r\nrequired;\r\n\r\nThat a committee of the College and Reference Section be appointed to\r\nsecure the publication of the list of dissertations referred to without\r\nexpense to the A. L. A.\r\n\r\n_Prosecution of book thieves._ Communications were read from C. K.\r\nBolton, recommending that the Council appropriate, when necessary, from\r\nthe income of the Endowment Fund, money to be used in the detection or\r\nprosecution of book thieves. It was pointed out that \"a few men\r\nsystematically rob libraries, particularly in small poor towns that\r\nhappen to have some rare books. To gather evidence and rid us of these\r\nmen requires money, and seems very properly to come within our field of\r\nwork.\" No action was taken on the subject.\r\n\r\n_Minute on John Fiske._ The memorial minute on John Fiske, prepared by\r\nthe special committee, consisting of J. K. Hosmer, George Iles and R. G.\r\nThwaites, was submitted to the Council and recommended for presentation\r\nto the Association, to be spread upon the records.

It was\r\n_Voted_, That $100 additional be also appropriated for the secretary's\r\nexpenses for the past year.\r\n\r\n_Non-library membership._ It was _Voted_, That the names of 38 persons\r\nnot engaged in library work, as presented by the treasurer, be accepted\r\nfor membership in the Association.\r\n\r\nNo meeting of the incoming Council or executive board was held, and the\r\nappointment of special and standing committees, reporters, etc., was\r\ntherefore deferred.\r\n\r\n                                          HELEN E.

In the absence of Miss Cornelia Marvin,\r\nchairman, Miss L. E. Stearns presided. The meeting was quite informal,\r\nand there were no prepared papers, except one by Miss GRATIA COUNTRYMAN\r\non\r\n\r\n                             OPPORTUNITIES.\r\n                             (_See_ p. 52.)\r\n\r\nAn introductory speech was made by Mr. Dewey, who spoke of the\r\neducational force that libraries should exert in the community, and the\r\nvaried field before the public library of to-day. There was some general\r\ndiscussion, in the course of which J. C. Dana read a letter describing\r\npioneer library work carried on in the Yukon district of Alaska, and E.\r\nP. McElroy told of some interesting incidents connected with the work of\r\nhis library at Algona, Iowa.\r\n\r\nAn early adjournment was made to attend the display of stereopticon\r\nviews of library buildings which was given on the same evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           ILLINOIS STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA most enthusiastic reunion of the alumni of the Illinois State Library\r\nSchool was held at Waukesha on July 5, in connection with the meeting of\r\nthe A. L. A.\r\n\r\nForty-seven members of the Alumni Association sat down to a long table\r\nwhich had been spread for them in the dining-room of the Fountain Spring\r\nHouse, where a very pleasant hour was passed in renewing old friendships\r\nand hearing about the work of classmates who had gone out to make\r\nthemselves famous in the library world.\r\n\r\nFollowing the dinner a business meeting was held, after which the\r\nmembers listened to a most interesting report by Miss Katharine L.\r\nSharp, director of the Illinois State Library School, on the growth and\r\npresent condition of the school, showing the changes which have come to\r\nit from its connection with the University of Illinois.\r\n\r\nMiss Sharp gave an outline of each course as it is now given in the\r\nschool, noting the changes which have been made and the reasons for\r\nthese changes. The report was of especial interest to the early\r\ngraduates of the school, who could follow the changes made in the course\r\nof instruction, the general development in scope and methods, and could\r\nso well comprehend the great growth of the school since its\r\nestablishment at Armour Institute of Technology, in Chicago, in 1893.\r\n\r\n                                           MARGARET MANN, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE SOCIAL SIDE OF THE WAUKESHA CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\n          BY JULIA T. RANKIN, _Carnegie Library, Atlanta, Ga._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo chronicle the social side of the twenty-third annual meeting of the\r\nAmerican Library Association is a pleasant duty. To recall all of the\r\ncourtesies extended to us by our hosts of the Middle West would take\r\nmore time than is at my disposal and more space than the Proceedings\r\nallot to the frivolous recreations of the strenuous librarians. Through\r\nthe entire period of the meeting, the good people of Waukesha did\r\neverything in their power to make the time pass pleasantly and Mr.\r\nWalker, the proprietor of the Fountain Spring Hotel, worked early and\r\nlate to make the members comfortable. Golf had a few members marked for\r\nits own, and these were not deterred by the\r\n110°-in-the-shade-conditions. Dancing was in order every evening after\r\nthe meetings (Sunday excepted) and the gentleman from Washington is said\r\nto have solved the problem of how often a man can dance with the same\r\ngirl in a given evening. The piazzas were ample and as each led to some\r\nspring sooner or later, the \"water habit\" became popular. The\r\ndining-room was, in the language of the daily papers, \"taxed to its\r\nutmost,\" but all shortcomings were treated with good-natured\r\nindifference when it was understood that the hotel had never\r\naccommodated so many people in its history, and the management promptly\r\nincreased its force of servants to meet the occasion.\r\n\r\nAccording to the program the social side of the conference should have\r\nbegun on the evening of July 3 with \"friendly greetings\" at 8.30 p.m.;\r\nbut as the New York party did not arrive until 9 p.m., and the New\r\nEngland party not until 2 a.m., it will readily be seen that the\r\nfriendly greetings had to be postponed. Social amenities, however,\r\ncommenced on the morning of \"the Fourth\" when the proverbial early bird,\r\narrayed in cool flannels or faultless duck, promenaded the long veranda\r\nof the Fountain House and greeted the later arrivals. As the \"later\r\narrivals\" had almost all come from a distance during one of the hottest\r\nweeks of the hottest summer known, and were consequently covered with\r\ndust and cinders, it was tantalizing to see the earlier arrivals in such\r\ncool array, and welcome speeches were cut short until the dust of travel\r\ncould be removed.\r\n\r\nThe coolness of the evening found a refreshed, summer-attired conference\r\nwending its way to the Methodist Church where the public meeting was\r\nheld. The speeches were interrupted repeatedly by the festive small boy\r\nand his Fourth of July crackers. The explosions caused untimely mirth\r\nwhen they punctuated or emphasized the well rounded periods of the\r\norators. The formal meeting was followed by informal groups on the\r\nveranda of the hotel and at the springs where thirsty mortals never\r\ntired of drinking the \"fizzy\" waters, that have made Waukesha famous as\r\nthe \"Saratoga of the West,\" and, indeed, the place has many features\r\nsimilar to its famous Eastern prototype.\r\n\r\nFriday evening was devoted to various dinner parties of the alumni of\r\nthe library training schools, and the dining-room with its long tables\r\nand flowers presented a festive scene. College yells and class cheers\r\nresounded through the halls. One got a good idea of the number of\r\ntechnically trained library assistants now dispersed over the country.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening the hotel management provided a dance for the guests\r\nand the great dining hall was transformed into a gay ballroom. Although\r\nMr. Cutter was absent the dancing contingent was ably represented, and a\r\ndelightful evening was enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe program meetings were well attended and the many papers presented\r\nduring the sultry days of the first week made Sunday a welcome day. The\r\nRest Cure seemed to be the order of the day until after lunch, when most\r\nof the members went to Milwaukee to see the public library, where an\r\ninformal reception was held. Misses Stearns, Dousman, Van Valkenburgh\r\nand Stillman entertained a party of 40 at White Fish Bay. A trolley ride\r\nto Milwaukee and on to this beautiful bay proved a good appetizer for\r\nthe very excellent lunch provided. The view of the lake was keenly\r\nenjoyed and the day was clear and cool. Twenty miles home and an early\r\nsupper, and most of us were willing to retire early, for the trip to\r\nMadison next day was scheduled for an early hour.\r\n\r\nAlthough the day spent in Madison was not strictly a \"social\" feature of\r\nthe conference, yet so delightfully did the citizens of Madison welcome\r\nthe visiting librarians that the record of the day in truth belongs to\r\nthe social chronicler. Its pleasures came as a complete surprise to\r\nthose who had not prepared themselves with Appleton's guide and other\r\nworks of ready reference. The building of the Historical Society is\r\ncertainly one of the most beautiful and sensibly arranged libraries in\r\nthe United States and its situation on the outskirts of the grounds of\r\nthe University of Wisconsin leaves nothing to be desired. In fact it\r\nwould be hard to picture a more beautiful situation for a university\r\ntown than this. The lakes, the undulating landscapes and the beautiful\r\nroads extending for twenty-five miles and maintained by a committee of\r\npublic spirited men, who also are responsible for planting the roadsides\r\nwith hardy shrubs, trees and flowers, make the external conditions\r\nideal. The whole party was driven through the town, the university\r\ncampus, and through five or six miles of the park roads, and was then\r\nescorted through the library building by Mr. Thwaites, Mr. Bradley and\r\nthe assistants. It was while the members were being driven through the\r\ntown that the new library anthem was perpetrated, and\r\n\r\n                      \"Of all the cakes\r\n                       My mother makes\r\n                       Give me the gingerbread!\"\r\n\r\nwill go down in A. L. A. history linked with\r\n\r\n                      \"Here's to Mr. Bradley\r\n                       Who smiles on us so badly,\r\n                                             gladly,\r\n                                                  madly,\r\n                                                    sadly!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole 350 found chairs in the gymnasium of the university and\r\ndisposed of every one of the doughnuts promised to them by Mr. Thwaites\r\nin his eloquent address on Luncheons the previous day. The afternoon was\r\nspent in inspection of the beautiful new library building, and here an\r\nhour or so later the \"official photograph\" was taken, the delegates\r\nbeing seated on the steps of the library with its stately façade for\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nMadison refused to maintain us after five o'clock, and on our return to\r\nWaukesha we found that the City Federation of Women's Clubs of Waukesha\r\nwould be \"at home\" in our honor, so we put on our prettiest frocks and\r\nwere presented in due form. The reception committee comprised Mrs. H. Y.\r\nYoumans, president of the State Federation; Miss L. E. Stearns, Mrs. O.\r\nZ. Olin, Mrs. C. E. Wilson, Miss Winifred Winans, Miss Emily Marsh and\r\nMiss Kate Kimball. A bevy of pretty girls served tempting ices and a\r\nmusical program was delightfully rendered.\r\n\r\nTuesday's program was almost too much for even the most confirmed\r\nconference attendant. From 9 a.m. till 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. till 6 did\r\nwe sit and listen or stand and discuss the program. At 9 p.m. Mr.\r\nEastman's display of library architecture, by means of a stereopticon,\r\nproved to be one of the most interesting features of the meeting. It is\r\nwonderful the advancement made in this form of library development; and\r\nstill more wonderful how many bad libraries are still being built when\r\nso much information is to be had on the subject.\r\n\r\nLater the dining-room was cleared and the conscientious librarians who\r\nhad sat all day in interesting sessions were invited to relieve the\r\nmonotony of work with the terpsichorean muse. It was a pretty sight to\r\nsee the girls in their muslin frocks and all the young and old members\r\nmeet in the measures of a Virginia reel. And such a reel; it will go\r\ndown to history as _the_ dance of the Waukesha meeting. Staid librarians\r\ngrowing bald with the weight of a nation's libraries; quiet instructors\r\nin library economics, all unbent to the fascination of this\r\nold-fashioned country dance.\r\n\r\nWednesday's sessions were somewhat broken by the necessary preparations\r\nfor departure. In order to leave nothing undone the hotel management\r\narranged a fire spectacle this last afternoon of the conference and the\r\nfair grounds looked their best with flames leaping in the air and the\r\nblack smoke rolling on. There was a large attendance of spectators,\r\nincluding the town fire department who declared the exhibition a great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThen came the leavetakings, and after many handshakings and hearty\r\nappreciations of hospitality, the conference gradually disintegrated and\r\nonly a small number of us were among that fortunate party lined up along\r\nthe wharf at Milwaukee to take the lake trip to Buffalo _en route_ to\r\nour homes.\r\n\r\nWe stood in silence as the big white _Northwest_ loomed in sight. This\r\nship and its twin-sister the _Northland_ represent the perfection of\r\nmodern lake travel and rival the trans-Atlantic liners in elegance and\r\ncomfort. It was a sleepy party that sought staterooms early. The morning\r\ncame fine and cloudless, and although the dawn and sunrise on the water\r\nseemed to come very early in this high latitude, it was a thing of\r\nbeauty--an aquarelle of Nature's best workmanship. The trip to Mackinac\r\nwas marked by the organization of the Infinite Eight, a secret society\r\nhaving blood-curdling ritual and banded together for offensive and\r\ndefensive tactics in the war upon the cuisine--led by the gallant\r\nsurvivor of the \"Adventures of a house-boat.\" This company attacked\r\neverything that was before it and demolished everything within its\r\nreach. Not until the last day were any reverses recorded and then\r\nNeptune with his trident reduced the gallant band to four. In memory of\r\nthis glorious record the survivors have applied for arms consisting of a\r\nship rampant on a field azure and the motto\r\n\r\n                  Puellæ Pallidæ non ad cenam veniunt.\r\n\r\nWhen Buffalo was reached the Pan-American exhibition claimed everyone's\r\nattention. Most of the party were there by eleven o'clock and spent the\r\nrest of the day. Mr. Elmendorf claimed a number of the men and gave them\r\na delightful dinner in \"In Nuremburg,\" and everyone was in front of the\r\ngreat pilons in time to see the electricity turned on at 8.30, after\r\nwhich the gondoliers became popular. It was Georgia Day at the\r\nExposition and the A. L. A. members who had attended the Atlanta\r\nconference were greeted by a familiar figure in the person of Mr.\r\nCabiniss, who had addressed the Association at Atlanta and was one of\r\nthe orators of the day. The most popular part of the proceedings,\r\nhowever, was the singing of the refrain\r\n\r\n                     \"He laid aside a suit of gray\r\n                      To wear the Union blue\"\r\n\r\nwhich was cheered and encored many times.\r\n\r\nSunday was spent at Niagara Falls by most of the survivors and\r\neverything was accomplished, even to going under the American Falls.\r\nMany goodbyes were said in the Nuremburg restaurant at the Exposition\r\nthat evening and the shutting off of the electric light closed one of\r\nthe pleasantest post-conference trips in the history of the Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES\r\n\r\n           SERVING IN 1900-01 AND DURING WAUKESHA CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_President_: Henry J.
