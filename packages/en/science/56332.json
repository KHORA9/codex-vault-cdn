There is no supernatural: all is related, cause\r\n  and sequence.

Through the whole universe beats the\r\n        one life-force, that is God, controlling every molecule\r\n        in the petal of a daisy, in the meteoric ring of Saturn,\r\n        in the remotest nebula that outskirts space, as though\r\n        that molecule were the universe. In each molecule and atom\r\n        God lives and moves and has His being, thereby sustaining\r\n        theirs.... Prophet after prophet cries, and psalmist after\r\n        psalmist sings, that so indeed he has found it; that therein\r\n        is the divine sonship of man, therein the assurance of eternal\r\n        life.--Rev. R. A. Armstrong.\r\n\r\n        The living man with his interior consciousness of self and\r\n        individuality is on two planes of nature at once, as a ship\r\n        is in two media at once, half in the water and half in the\r\n        air. To manage your ship successfully you must take cognizance\r\n        of the laws governing each of those media. To deal successfully\r\n        with your human being you must understand his physiology\r\n        no doubt, but you must equally understand his psychology,\r\n        and something of the collateral phenomena of nature in those\r\n        regions or planes to which the phenomena of the psychic man\r\n        belong.--A. P. Sinnett.\r\n\r\n        The splendid generalizations of our physicists and our\r\n        naturalists, have had for me an enthralling and entrancing\r\n        interest. I find as I look out on the world, in the light of\r\n        all this new knowledge, a pressure of God upon consciousness\r\n        everywhere; and if this physical force which is God, moves\r\n        through, sustains, communes, with each smallest physical\r\n        atom of the whole, much more must that conscious energy\r\n        which is God, move through, sustain, commune with, these\r\n        conscious atoms, these several monads, which are you and I,\r\n        and our friend, and our brother far away. The even flow of\r\n        the divine force through every material atom, which is the\r\n        supreme revelation of physical science in our time, itself\r\n        leads irresistibly on to the suggestion of the constant flow\r\n        of spiritual energy in actual communion with every spiritual\r\n        monad that there is. It becomes but a question of opening the\r\n        eyes of the soul, unstopping the ears of the inward spirit,\r\n        to see and hear the God who in us also surely lives and moves\r\n        and has His being, thereby sustaining ours. As the physical\r\n        atom is physically touched and held and thrilled by God,\r\n        it is what we should expect that the conscious monad, no\r\n        less should be consciously touched and held and thrilled by\r\n        Him.--Rev.

John Andrew, of Belfast.\r\n\r\n\"Wait on the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Almighty is taking men into His deeper confidence as to His\r\nCreation ways, and how His ways may be taken advantage of for man's\r\nservice and benefit, the gifted one through whom such revealing is\r\nbeing made should not be hurried by the common bustle of the world,\r\nbut should be protected in the privacy where the Creator and he\r\nare closeted together in the giving and receiving which is thus\r\ntranspiring.\r\n\r\nScientific patience is, in all such cases, imperative. When the gifted\r\none is bustled by the world, as Mr. Keely has been, his inspiration\r\nis disturbed and his advance hindered. If the first inkling of some\r\ngreat revealing thus in progress should promise some mighty find for\r\nthe material advantage of mankind, there is naturally a quickened\r\ndesire to gain possession; but if in such an event impatience should\r\nimpel the seer, ere his far-visioned sight has reached the end,\r\ndeplorable delay may be the result.\r\n\r\nThis is the thing which has happened in the case which this little\r\nvolume comes forth to relate and explain. It is not intended to unfold\r\nthe systematic methods of the gifted genius concerning whom it speaks;\r\nthat will come, in his own words, in due time. The aim of this volume\r\nis to show the course of events in relation to his researches; and to\r\nopen the mystery of how it came about that he should have been so much\r\nmisunderstood and hindered. It tells how he, in the dim dawn of initial\r\ninspiration, first glimpsed and touched The Power which is about to\r\nbe given to the possession of mankind for the supply of wants, and\r\nthe relief of toil. How he struggled and wrestled like the patriarch\r\nof old who said, \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\" How\r\nmen of the world, seeing the struggle and estimating the power, said,\r\n\"Make haste and harness this power to our machinery, and we shall\r\npay you.\" How, in his need of means, he was tempted and fell; making\r\nan attempt to harness to machinery a power whose very form and kind\r\nhe had not yet been given to discern. And then, when this too hasty\r\nattempt had failed, how the disappointed world laughed and mocked,\r\nand fumed, and called him an impostor.\r\n\r\nThis volume seeks to explain this Keely Mystery; and to show that\r\nalthough a mistake was made, it was only a passing mistake. The\r\nmistake has been rectified; and the seer, now in possession of peace\r\nand privacy, has fully sighted the power, and is making progress in\r\nbringing it into subjugation.\r\n\r\nHe has been interviewed by competent men, men of enlarged scientific\r\nvision; and in the protection of their esteem, and by the liberal\r\npecuniary aid of one who has made scientific interests an object\r\nof sacred solicitude, Mr. Keely is likely to succeed in opening\r\nto the world another of the stores which the Almighty Creator and\r\nPreserver, ever provident of His children's needs, has prepared in\r\nreserve against the time of their necessity. We may theorize, but God\r\nalone knows the means by which the regeneration of mankind, and the\r\nestablishment of the kingdom of righteousness and peace shall come\r\nabout. The All-merciful has a purpose and plan of His own. The power\r\nwhich Mr. Keely is dealing with belongs to the ways and means of the\r\nevolution of civilization and material providence; and it will depend\r\non how men make use of it how far it may clear or block the way of this\r\nplanet's highest weal. The power, however, which Mr. Keely is dealing\r\nwith lies so close to the spiritual realm of things, and brings us\r\nso near to the point at which the Almighty is in immediate touch of\r\nHis Creation in His unceasing upholding of it, that all Christian men\r\nmight be expected to take a deep interest in researches which promise\r\nso much. It may reasonably be hoped that this volume may promote this\r\ninterest, and turn the attention to coming events which are casting\r\nmore than shadows before. With this hope we commend it to the reading\r\nof the wise. Those who delight in yellow-covered literature may pass\r\nit by; it contains no plot for the excitement of such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n        Ex Vivo Omnia.\r\n\r\n        We stand before the dawning of a new day in science and\r\n        humanity,--a new discovery, surpassing any that has been\r\n        hitherto made; which promises to afford us a key to some of\r\n        the most recondite secrets of nature, and to open up to our\r\n        view a new world.--Dr. Hufeland.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe error of our century in questions of research seems to have been in\r\nthe persistent investigation of the phenomena of matter (or material\r\norganization) as the sole province of physics, regarding psychical\r\nresearch as lying outside. The term physics is derived from a Greek\r\nword signifying \"nature.\" Nature does not limit herself to matter and\r\nmechanism. The phenomena of spirit are as much a part of Nature as are\r\nthose of matter. The psychological theories of our physicists display\r\na decided leaning towards materialism, disregarding the manifestations\r\nof the vital principle,--the vis motrix,--and refusing to investigate\r\nbeyond the limits which they have imposed upon themselves, and which,\r\nif accepted by all, would take us back to the belief of the pagans,\r\nas echoed by Voltaire:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Est-ce-là ce rayon de l'Essence Suprême\r\n        Que l'on nous peint si lumineux?\r\n        Est-ce-là cet Esprit survivant à nous-même?\r\n        Il nait avec nos sens, croît, s'affaiblit comme eux:\r\n            Hélas! il périra de même.\r\n\r\n\r\nSympathetic philosophy teaches that the various phenomena of the human\r\nconstitution cannot be properly comprehended and explained without\r\nobserving the distinction between the physical and material, and the\r\nmoral and spiritual nature of man. It demonstrates incontrovertibly\r\nthe separate existence and independent activity of the soul of man,\r\nand that the spirit governs the body instead of being governed by\r\nthe body. As Spenser has said,--\r\n\r\n\r\n        For of the soul the body form doth take;\r\n        For soul is form, and doth the body make.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuxley tells us that science prospers exactly in proportion as\r\nit is religious, and that religion flourishes in exact proportion\r\nto the scientific depth and firmness of its basis. \"Civilization,\r\nsociety, and morals,\" says Figuier, \"are like a string of beads,\r\nwhose fastening is the belief in the immortality of the soul. Break\r\nthe fastening and the beads are scattered.\"\r\n\r\nNow, as Nature nowhere exhibits to our visual perceptions a soul\r\nacting without a body, and as we do not know in what manner the\r\nspiritual faculties are united to the organization, psychology is\r\ncompelled to investigate the operations of the intellect as if they\r\nwere performed altogether independently of the body; whereas they\r\nare only manifested, in the ordinary state of existence, through the\r\nintermediate agency of the corporeal organs.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of psychological facts and speculations\r\nwhich characterize this age appears to have made little or no\r\npermanent impression upon the minds of our scientists and our\r\nphilosophers. Bishop Berkeley asks, \"Have not Fatalism and Sadducism\r\ngained ground during the general passion for the corpuscularian and\r\nmechanical philosophy which hath prevailed?\" Buffon, in writing\r\nof the sympathy, or relation, which exists throughout the whole\r\nanimal economy, said, \"Let us, with the ancients, call this singular\r\ncorrespondence of the different parts of the body a sympathy, or,\r\nwith the moderns consider it as an unknown relation in the action\r\nof the nervous system, we cannot too carefully observe its effects,\r\nif we wish to perfect the theory of medicine.\" Colquhoun, commenting\r\nupon Buffon's statement, says that far too little attention has\r\nbeen paid to the spiritual nature of man,--to the effects of those\r\nimmaterial and invisible influences which, analogous to the chemical\r\nand electrical agents, are the true springs of our organization,\r\ncontinually producing changes internally which are externally perceived\r\nas the marked effects of unseen causes, and which cannot be explained\r\nupon the principles of any law of mechanism.\r\n\r\nThese unseen causes are now made clear to us by the truths which\r\nVibratory Physics and Sympathetic Philosophy demonstrate and\r\nsustain. The prophecy of Dr. Hufeland (made in connection with an\r\naccount of certain phenomena arising from the unchangeable laws of\r\nsympathetic association) is soon to be fulfilled, and the door thrown\r\nopen to \"a new world\" of research. Professor Rücker in his papers on\r\n\"Molecular Forces,\" William Crookes in his lecture on \"The Genesis\r\nof Elements,\" Norman Lockyer in his book on \"The Chemistry of the\r\nSun,\"--all these scientists have approached so near to this hitherto\r\nbolted, double-barred and locked portal that the wonder is not so\r\nmuch that they have approached as that, drawing so near, they have\r\nnot passed within.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rücker, in his papers (read before the Royal Institution\r\nof Great Britain) explaining the attractive and repulsive action\r\nof molecules, found himself obliged to apologize to scientists\r\nfor suggesting the possibility of an intelligence by which alone\r\nhe could explain certain phenomena unaccounted for by science; but\r\ndo we not find proof in ourselves that the action of molecules is\r\nan intelligent action? For we must admit the individuality of the\r\nmolecules in our organisms, in order to understand how it is that\r\nnourishment maintains life. Try as we may to account for the action\r\nof aliment upon the system, all is resolved into the fact that there\r\nmust be some intelligent force at work. Do we ourselves disunite\r\nand intermingle, by myriad channels, in order to rejoin and replace\r\na molecule which awaits this aid? We must either affirm that it is\r\nso, that we place them where we think they are needed, or that it\r\nis the molecules that find a place of themselves. We know that we\r\nare occupied in other ways which demand all our thoughts. It must,\r\ntherefore, be that these molecules find their own place. Admit this,\r\nand we accord life and intelligence to them. If we reason that it\r\nis our nerves which appropriate substances that they need for the\r\nmaintenance of their energy and their harmonious action, we then\r\nconcede to the nerves what we deny to the molecules. Or, if we think\r\nit more natural to attribute this power to the viscera,--the stomach,\r\nfor example,--we only change the thesis.\r\n\r\nIt will be said that it is pantheism to assert that matter, under\r\nall the forms which it presents, is only groups of aggregates\r\nof sympathetic molecules, of a substance unalterable in its\r\nindividualities; a thinking, acting substance. Let us not deny what\r\nwe are unable to explain. God is all that is, without everything that\r\nis being individually God. Etheric force has been compared to the\r\ntrunk of a tree, the roots of which rest in Infinity. The branches\r\nof the tree correspond to the various modifications of this one\r\nforce,--heat, light, electricity, and its close companion force,\r\nmagnetism. It is held in suspension in our atmosphere. It exists\r\nthroughout the universe. Actual science not admitting a void, then all\r\nthings must touch one another. To touch is to be but one by contiguity,\r\nor there would be between one thing and another something which might\r\nbe termed space, or nothing. Now, as nothing cannot exist, there must\r\nbe something between \"the atomic triplets\" which are, according to the\r\nKeely theory, found in each molecule. This something in the molecule\r\nhe affirms to be \"the universal fluid,\" or molecular ether. One thing\r\ntouching another, all must therefore be all in all, and through all,\r\nby the sensitive combination of all the molecules in the universe,\r\nas is demonstrated by electricity, galvanism, the loadstone, etc. If\r\nwe account for the intelligent action of molecules by attributing\r\nit to what has been variously called \"the universal fluid,\" \"the\r\nelectric fluid,\" \"the galvanic fluid,\" \"the nervous fluid,\" \"the\r\nmagnetic fluid,\" it will only be substituting one name for another;\r\nit is still some part or other of the organization which discerns and\r\njoins to itself a portion of one of the fluids referred to, or one of\r\nthese fluids which discerns and mingles with the material molecules;\r\nit is still the life of the part, the life of the molecule, life\r\nindividualized in all and through all.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, then, that there is a universal fluid, it must exist in\r\nand through all things. If void does not exist, everything is full;\r\nif all is full, everything is in contact; if everything is in contact,\r\nthe whole influences and is influenced because all is life; and life is\r\nmovement, because movement is a continual disunion and union of all the\r\nmolecules which compose the whole. The ancient philosophers admitted\r\nall this. Under the different names of \"macrocosm,\" \"microcosm,\"\r\n\"corpuscles,\" \"emanations,\" \"attraction,\" \"repulsion,\" \"sympathy,\" and\r\n\"antipathy,\"--all names which are only one,--their various propositions\r\nwere merely the product of inductions influenced by their modes of\r\nobserving, as the deductions of scientists are influenced in our day.\r\n\r\nBalzac tells us that everything here below is the product of an\r\nethereal substance, the common basis of various phenomena, known under\r\nthe inappropriate names of electricity, heat, light, galvanic and\r\nmagnetic fluid, etc., and that the universality of its transmutations\r\nconstitutes what is vulgarly called matter. We cannot take up a book\r\non physics (written with true scientific knowledge) in which we do not\r\nfind evidence that its author acknowledges that there is, correctly\r\nspeaking, but one force in nature. Radcliffe tells us that what is\r\ncalled electricity is only a one-sided aspect of a law which, when\r\nfully revealed, will be found to rule over organic as well as inorganic\r\nnature--a law to which the discoveries of science and the teachings of\r\nphilosophy alike bear testimony,--a law which does not entomb life in\r\nmatter, but which transfigures matter with a life which, when traced\r\nto its source, will prove only to be the effluence of the Divine life.\r\n\r\nMacvicar teaches that the nearer we ascend to the fountain-head of\r\nbeing and of action, the more magical must everything inevitably\r\nbecome; for that fountain-head is pure volition. And pure volition,\r\nas a cause is precisely what is meant by magic; for by magic is meant a\r\nmode of producing a phenomenon without mechanical appliances,--that is,\r\nwithout that seeming continuity of resisting parts and that leverage\r\nwhich satisfy our muscular sense and our imagination and bring the\r\nphenomenon into the category of what we call \"the natural;\" that is,\r\nthe sphere of the elastic, the gravitating,--the sphere into which\r\nthe vis inertiæ is alone admitted.\r\n\r\nThere is in Professor Crookes's \"Genesis of the Elements\" an hypothesis\r\nof great interest,--a projectment of philosophical truth which brings\r\nhim nearer than any known living scientist to the ground held by\r\nKeely. Davy defines hypothesis as the scaffolding of science, useful\r\nto build up true knowledge, but capable of being put up or taken\r\ndown at pleasure, without injuring the edifice of philosophy. When\r\nwe find men in different parts of the world constructing the same\r\nkind of scaffolding, we may feel fairly sure that they have an\r\nedifice to build. The scaffolding may prove to be insecure, but it\r\ncan be flung away and another constructed. It is the edifice that\r\nis all-important,--the philosophy not the hypotheses. The science\r\nof learning, says Professor Lesley, and the science of knowledge\r\nare not quite identical; and learning has too often, in the case\r\nof individuals, overwhelmed and smothered to death knowledge. It\r\nis a familiar fact that great discoveries come at long intervals,\r\nbrought by specially-commissioned and highly-endowed messengers;\r\nwhile a perpetual procession of humble servants of nature arrive with\r\ngifts of lesser moment, but equally genuine, curious, and interesting\r\nnovelties. From what unknown land does all this wealth of information\r\ncome? Who are these bearers of it? And who intrusted each with his\r\nparticular burden, which he carries aloft as if it deserved exclusive\r\nadmiration? Why do those who bring the best things walk so seriously\r\nand modestly along as if they were in the performance of a sacred duty,\r\nfor which they scarcely esteem themselves worthy?\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Carlisle, in his paper on \"The Uniformity of Nature,\"\r\nsuggests the answer to all who are prepared to approach the abyss\r\nwhich has hitherto divided physical science from spiritual science,--an\r\nabyss which is soon to be illumined by the sunlight of demonstration\r\nand spanned by the bridge of knowledge. To quote from the paper of\r\nthe Bishop of Carlisle, \"There are matters of the highest moment\r\nwhich manifestly do lie outside the domain of physical science. The\r\npossibility of the continuance of human existence in a spiritual form\r\nafter the termination of physical life is, beyond contradiction,\r\none of the grandest and most momentous of possibilities, but in\r\nthe nature of things it lies outside physics. Yet there is nothing\r\nabsolutely absurd, nothing which contradicts any human instinct,\r\nin the supposition of such possibility; consequently, the student\r\nof physical science, even if he cannot find time or inclination to\r\nlook into such matters himself, may well have patience with those who\r\ncan. And he may easily afford to be generous: the field of physical\r\nscience is grand enough for any ambition, and there is room enough\r\nin the wide world both for physical and for psychical research.\"\r\n\r\nBut does psychical research lie outside the domain of physical\r\nscience? What is the supernatural but the higher workings of laws\r\nwhich we call natural, as far as we have been able to investigate\r\nthem? Is not the supernatural, then, just as legitimate a subject of\r\nconsideration, for the truly scientific mind, as is the natural? If\r\nit explains, satisfactorily, phenomena which cannot be otherwise\r\nexplained, there is no good reason why its aid should not be invoked\r\nby men of science. The truth is, that the ordinary course of nature\r\nis one continued miracle, one continued manifestation of the Divine\r\nmind. \"Everything which is, is thought,\" says Amiel, \"but not conscious\r\nand individual thought. Everything is a symbol of a symbol; and a\r\nsymbol of what?--of mind. We are hemmed round with mystery, and the\r\ngreatest mysteries are contained in what we see, and do, every day.\"\r\n\r\nKeely affirms, with other philosophers, that there is only one unique\r\nsubstance, and that this substance is the Divine spirit, the spirit\r\nof life, and that this spirit of life is God, who fills everything\r\nwith His thoughts; disjoining and grouping together these multitudes\r\nof thoughts in different bodies called atmospheres, fluids, matters,\r\nanimal, vegetable, and mineral forms.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer says that amid the mysteries that become the more\r\nmysterious the more they are thought about, there will remain the one\r\nabsolute certainty, that we are ever in the presence of an infinite\r\nand an eternal energy, from which all things proceed. Macvicar\r\nforeshadowed the teachings of this new philosophy when he wrote, \"All\r\nmotion in the universe is rhythmical. This is seen in the forward and\r\nbackward movement of the pendulum, the ebb and the flow of the tides,\r\nthe succession of day and night, the systolic and diastolic action of\r\nthe heart, and in the inspiration and expiration of the lungs. Our\r\nbreathing is a double motion of universal æther, an active and a\r\nreactive movement. This androgyne principle, with its dual motion,\r\nis the breath of God in man.\" The writings of the ancients teem with\r\nthese ideas, which have been handed down to us from generation to\r\ngeneration, and are now flashing their light, like torches in the\r\ndarkness, upon mysteries too long regarded as \"lying outside the\r\ndomains of physical science.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago Macvicar wrote his \"Sketch of a Philosophy,\" in\r\nwhich he advanced the above views, with other views now maintained and\r\ndemonstrated by Keely, who during these twenty years, without knowing\r\nMacvicar's views, or of his existence even, has been engaged in that\r\n\"dead-work which cannot be delegated,\" the result of which is not\r\nlearning, but knowledge; for learning, says Lessing, is only our\r\nknowledge of the experience of others; knowledge is our own. This\r\nburden of dead-work, writes Lesley, every great discoverer has had\r\nto carry for years and years, unknown to the world at large, before\r\nthe world was electrified by his appearance as its genius. Without\r\nit, there can be no discovery of what is rightly called a scientific\r\ntruth. Every advancement in science comes from this \"dead-work,\" and\r\ncreates, of its own nature, an improvement in the condition of the\r\nrace; putting, as it does, the multitudes of human society on a fairer\r\nand friendlier footing with one another. And during these twenty years\r\nof \"dead-work\" the discoverer of etheric force has pursued the even\r\ntenor of his way, under circumstances which show him to be a giant\r\nin intellectual greatness, insensible to paltry, hostile criticism,\r\npatient under opposition, dead to all temptations of self-interest,\r\ncalmly superior to the misjudgments of the short-sighted and ignoble;\r\nnoble means as indispensable to him as noble ends; fame and riches less\r\nimportant than his honour; his joys arising from the accomplishment of\r\nhis work and the love and the sympathy of the few who have comprehended\r\nhim! \"Only the noble-hearted can understand the noble-hearted.\" Keely's\r\nchief ambition has been to utilize the force he discovered; not for\r\nhis own aggrandizement, but to bless the lives of his fellow-men. He\r\nhas scaled the rocks which barricade earth from heaven, and he knows\r\nthat the fire which he has brought down with him is divine.\r\n\r\nThis so-called secret is an open secret, which, after it is known,\r\nmay be read everywhere,--in the revolution of the planets as well as\r\nin the crystallization of minerals and in the growth of a flower.\r\n\r\n\"But why does not Keely share his knowledge with others?\" \"Why does\r\nhe not proclaim his secret to the world?\" are questions that are\r\noften asked. Keely has no secret to proclaim to the world. Not until\r\nthe aerial ship is in operation will the world be able to comprehend\r\nthe nature of Keely's discoveries. When the distinguished physicist,\r\nProfessor Dewar, of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, goes\r\nto America this summer, he will be instructed by Mr. Keely in his\r\ndissociation processes. Every man who has passed the mere threshold of\r\nscience ought to be aware that it is quite possible to be in possession\r\nof a series of facts long before he is capable of giving a rational\r\nand satisfactory explanation of them--in short, before he is enabled\r\nto discover their causes even. This \"dead-work\" has occupied many\r\nyears of Keely's life; and only within the last five years has he\r\nreached that degree of perfection which warranted the erection of a\r\nscaffolding for the construction of the true edifice of philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe have only to recall the wonderful discoveries which have been made\r\nin modern times, relative to the properties of heat, of electricity, of\r\ngalvanism, etc., in order to acknowledge that had any man ventured to\r\nanticipate the powers and uses of the steam-engine, the voltaic pile,\r\nthe electrical battery, or of any other of those mighty instruments\r\nby means of which the mind of man has acquired so vast a dominion\r\nover the world of matter, he would probably have been considered a\r\nvisionary; and had he been able to exhibit the effects of any of these\r\ninstruments, before the principles which regulate their action had\r\nbecome generally known to philosophers, they would in all likelihood\r\nhave been attributed to fraud or to juggling. Herein lies the secret\r\nof Keely's delay. His work is not yet completed to that point where\r\nhe can cease experimenting and publish the results of his \"dead-work\"\r\nto the world.\r\n\r\n\"When will he be ready?\" is a question often asked; but it is one that\r\nGod only can answer, as to the year and day. It now seems as if the\r\ntime were near at hand,--within this very year; but not even Keely\r\nhimself can fix the date, until he has finished his present course of\r\nexperiments, his \"graduation\"  of his twenty-seventh and last group of\r\ndepolar disks, for effecting change and interchange with polar force.\r\n\r\n\"But what are his hypotheses? And what the tenets of his new\r\nphilosophy?\" His hypotheses are as antithetic to existing hypotheses\r\nin chemistry as the Newtonian system, at its first publication, was\r\nantithetic to the vortices of Descartes. The philosophy is not of his\r\ncreation; nor is it a new philosophy. It is as old as the universe. Its\r\ntenets are unpopular, heterodox tenets, but their grandeur, when\r\ncompared with prevailing theories, will cause the latter to appear\r\nlike the soap-bubbles that Sir William Drummond said the grown-up\r\nchildren of science amuse themselves with; whilst the honest vulgar\r\nstand gazing in stupid admiration, dignifying these learned vagaries\r\nwith the name of science. It is the sole edifice of true philosophy,\r\nthe corner-stone of which was laid at Creation, when God said,\r\n\"Let there be light; and there was light.\" The scaffolding which\r\nour modern Prometheus has built is not the airy fabric of delusion,\r\nnor the baser fabric of a fraud, as has been so often asserted. It\r\nhas been built plank by plank, upon firm ground, and every plank is\r\nof pure gold, as will be seen in due time.\r\n\r\nIt has been justly said that we have no ground for assuming that we\r\nhave approached a limit in the field of discovery, or for claiming\r\nfinality in our interpretations of Nature. We have, as yet, only\r\nlifted one corner of the curtain, enabling us to peep at some of\r\nthe machinery by which her operations are effected, while much more\r\nremains concealed; and we know little of the marvels which in course\r\nof time may be made clear to us.\r\n\r\nEarnest minds in all ages and in all countries have arrived at the\r\nsame inferences which Keely has reached in his researches,--viz.,\r\nthat the one intelligent force in nature is not a mere mathematical\r\ndynamism in space and time, but a true Power existing in its type\r\nand fulness,--deity. You may say that such an inference belongs to\r\nreligion, not to science, but you cannot divorce the two. No systematic\r\ndistinction between philosophical, religious, and scientific ideas can\r\nbe maintained. All the three run into one another with the most perfect\r\nlegitimacy. Their dissociation can be effected only by art, their\r\ndivorce only by violence. Great as is the revolution in mechanics which\r\nis to take place through this discovery, it has an equally important\r\nbearing on all questions connected with psychical research. Once\r\ndemonstrated, we shall hear no more of the brain secreting thought,\r\nas the liver secretes bile. The laws of \"rhythmical harmony,\" of\r\n\"assimilation,\" of \"sympathetic association,\" will be found governing\r\nall things, in the glorious heavens above us, down to the least atom\r\nupon our earth. Leibnitz's assertion, that \"perceptivity and its\r\ncorrelative perceptibility are coextensive with the whole sphere of\r\nindividualized being,\" will be accounted for without depriving us\r\nof a Creator. \"The music of the spheres\" will be proved a reality,\r\ninstead of a figure of speech. St. Paul's words, \"In Him we live,\r\nand move, and have our being,\" will be better understood. The power\r\nof mind over matter will be incontrovertibly demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"The requirement of every demonstration is that it shall give\r\nsufficient proof of the truth it asserts.\" This Keely is prepared to\r\ngive,--mechanical demonstration; and should he really have discovered\r\nthe fundamental creative law, which he long since divined must exist,\r\nproving that the universal ether which permeates all molecules is\r\nthe tangible link between God and man, connecting the infinite with\r\nthe finite,--that it is the true protoplasm, or mother element of\r\neverything,--we may look for a philosophy which will explain all\r\nunexplained phenomena and reconcile the conflicting opinions of\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nThe great law of sympathetic association, once understood, will become\r\nknown as it is,--viz., as the governing medium of the universe. Herein\r\nlies the secret, the revelation of which will usher in the spiritual\r\nage foretold by the Prophets of the Old Testament and the Apostles\r\nof the New Testament. Inspiration is not confined to prophets and\r\napostles and poets: the man of science, the writer, all who reach out\r\nafter the Infinite, receive their measure of inspiration according\r\nto their capacity. We need a new revelation to turn back \"the tidal\r\nwave of materialism\" which has rolled in upon the scientific world,\r\nas much as Moses needed one when he sought to penetrate the mysteries\r\nof the Creation; and our revelation is near at hand,--a revelation\r\nwhich will change the statical \"I am\" into the dynamical \"I will,\"--a\r\nrevelation which, while teaching us to look from Nature up to Nature's\r\nGod, will reveal to us our own powers as \"children of God,\" as \"heirs\r\nof immortality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowledge,\" said Lord Beaconsfield, \"is like the mystic ladder in the\r\nPatriarch's dream. Its base rests on the primeval earth--its crest\r\nis lost in the shadowy splendour of the empyrean; while the great\r\nauthors who, for traditionary ages, have held the chain of science\r\nand philosophy, of poesy and erudition, are the angels ascending and\r\ndescending the sacred scale, maintaining, as it were, the communication\r\nbetween man and heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThis beautiful imagery holds within it that seed of truth, which\r\nis said to exist in the wildest fable; for, although all great\r\ndiscoveries, pertaining to the material world, have been made\r\ngradually, with much starting on the wrong track, much false deduction\r\nand much worthless result, spiritual truths can be revealed to man\r\nin no other way than by that spiritual influence which maintains\r\ncommunication between the terrestrial and the celestial, or the\r\nmaterial and the spiritual. \"Truth is attained through immediate\r\nintuition,\" say the Aryan teachers; but only by those who have educated\r\ntheir sixth sense; as will be seen in Mr. Sinclair's new work,\r\n\"Vera Vita; or, the Philosophy of Sympathy.\" While the imaginative\r\nscientist is puzzling himself about new natural forces and the\r\napparent suspension of old and hitherto invariable laws, Sinclair,\r\nin his writings, shows us that it is because we do not recognize the\r\nelements of nature that their influences remain mysterious to us.\r\n\r\nMr. Sinclair is as firm in his belief as is Mr. Keely that this element\r\nis the great connecting link between the Creator and the created,\r\nand that it is capable of rendering more marvellous services to man\r\nthan all the discovered uses of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe coincidences in the theories of these two philosophers are the\r\nmore remarkable, inasmuch as Mr. Sinclair's have their origin, as set\r\nforth in his book \"A New Creed,\" in metaphysics; while \"Keely's wide\r\nand far-reaching philosophy\" (to quote the words of a distinguished\r\nphysicist) \"has a physical genesis, and has been developed by long\r\nyears of patient and persistent research.\" But it is an undisputed fact\r\nthat, in countries far distant from each other, different men have\r\nfallen into the same lines of research; and have made correspondent\r\ndiscoveries, at the same time, without having had any communication\r\nwith each other; and never has there been a time when so many were\r\ntesting all things that appear to give proof of the super-sensual\r\nelement in man. There is a very general impression all over the world,\r\nsays Marie Correlli, that the time is ripe for a clearer revelation\r\nof God and \"the hidden things of God\" than we have ever had before.\r\n\r\nAll persons who are interested in Keely's discoveries and the\r\nnature of the unknown element discovered by Keely and Sinclair,\r\nwill find in the writings of the latter a more lucid explanation\r\nof sympathetic association than Keely himself has ever been able to\r\ngive in writing. The title of this remarkable book would have been\r\nmore wisely chosen had its author called it \"A New Element and a New\r\nOrder of Things.\" The Rev. Philip Schaff, D.D., says of creeds:--\"The\r\nBible is the word of God to man: the Creed is the answer of man to\r\nGod. The Bible is the book to be explained and applied; the Creed is\r\nthe Church's understanding and summary of the Bible.\" It is in this\r\nlight that Mr. Sinclair's new creed, human and humane, should be read.\r\n\r\nThere is no conductivity in the ether lines, writes Sinclair, for\r\nselfish desires and motives; for they are not of the soul, but are only\r\nsounds of the lips (or wishes of the material part of us), so that the\r\nestablished connecting-rod between the living soul and the source of\r\nlife is insulated from desires that are not begotten in sympathy, and\r\nthey at once run to earth. Where there is no connection there can be no\r\ncommunion. Without the natural sympathetic etheric connection between\r\nthe source of life and the soul, there can be no communication. \"A New\r\nCreed,\" like the sympathetic etheric philosophy of Keely, reveals the\r\nconnecting link between the finite and the Infinite, and teaches us\r\nthat the primal law of evolution and of progress is slowly but surely\r\npreparing our race for the time when Christianity will be something\r\nmore than a mere profession, and \"the brotherhood of humanity\" will\r\nno longer be the meaningless phrase that it now is. We are led to see,\r\nby this pure philosophy, that \"our solar system is a type of a healthy\r\nsocial system; that in it each one affects, binds, controls, sustains,\r\nhelps, makes free each other; that no star lives for itself alone;\"\r\nthat man was not made to mourn, and that our sufferings arise from\r\nour ignorance of the laws governing the innate motive power within us.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The times are not degenerate! Men's faith\r\n        Mounts higher than of old. No crumbling creed\r\n        Can take from the immortal soul its need\r\n    Of something greater than itself. The wraith\r\n        Of dead belief we cherished in our youth,\r\n        Fades but to let us welcome new born truth.\r\n    Man may not worship at the ancient shrine,\r\n        Prone on his face, in self-accusing scorn.\r\n        That night is passed; he hails a fairer morn,\r\n    And knows himself a something half divine!\r\n        No humble worm whose heritage is sin,\r\n    But part of God--he feels the Christ within!\r\n    No fierce Jehovah with a frowning mien\r\n        He worships. Nay, through love, and not through fear,\r\n        He seeks the truth, and finds its source is near!\r\n    He feels and owns the power of things unseen,\r\n        Where once he scoffed. God's great primeval plan\r\n        Is fast unfolding in the soul of man.--Ella W. Wilcox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEELY AND HIS DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1872 TO 1882.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n        Within the half-century the hypothetical ether has amply\r\n        vindicated its novel claim to take its place as a mysterious\r\n        entity side by side with matter and energy among the ultimate\r\n        components of the objective universe.... Modern science sets\r\n        before our eyes the comprehensive and glorious idea of a\r\n        cosmos which is one and the same throughout, in sun and star\r\n        and world and atom, in light and heat and life and mechanism,\r\n        in herb and tree and man and animal, in body, soul, and spirit,\r\n        mind and matter.--Grant Allen on Evolution.\r\n\r\n        The man who can demonstrate the existence of an unsuspected\r\n        and unknown force has a right, in the absence of demonstrative\r\n        proof to the contrary, to form his own theory of its origin,\r\n        and to make it the basis of his own system. Keely is looking\r\n        at physical phenomena and their explanations from a point of\r\n        view so different from that of the inductive school, that we\r\n        hardly know how to combine the two, or show their bearings\r\n        upon each other. For myself, I think now, as I thought and\r\n        said in my address, that the absolutely exclusive position,\r\n        taken up by Huxley, Tyndall, and the so-called Material\r\n        School, is ludicrously indefensible; and that we should be\r\n        as perfectly open to evidence in any direction, as we were\r\n        2000 years ago.--The Rev. H. W. Watson, D.Sc., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many men of learning are now holding Dr. Watson's views that\r\nthe time seems to have arrived, in which the theories of Keely will\r\nreceive, from those who are competent to judge of their value, the\r\nattention that they deserve. Before entering upon their merits,\r\nor setting them down for others to judge of their worth, the way\r\nmust be prepared by showing the claims which they possess from their\r\ncorrespondence with some of the most advanced ideas of the present day,\r\nas well as with the teachings of the wisest men in past centuries.\r\n\r\nThe mode which is the least laborious to accomplish this end, is\r\nby collecting what has been written and printed, which bears upon,\r\nand elucidates this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is now very generally known that Mr. Keely, while pursuing a line\r\nof experiment in vibrations, \"accidentally\" as Edison would say,\r\nmade his discovery of an energy, the origin of which was unknown\r\nto himself; and six years passed, in experiment, before he was able\r\nto repeat its production at will. In the meantime he had exhausted\r\nhis resources and willingly accepted the proposal of men, who, after\r\nwitnessing the operation of the energy that he was able to show with\r\nthis unknown force, offered to organize a company to furnish him with\r\nthe means to construct an engine to use this force as the motive power,\r\nanticipating immediate success.\r\n\r\nBut discovery is one thing, invention quite another thing, and\r\nthe years rolled on without Mr. Keely's being able to fulfil his\r\npromises. In 1882, which was about ten years after the company was\r\nformed, an action at law was brought against him for non-fulfilment\r\nof his contract. The Evening Bulletin of March 30th of that year thus\r\nexplains, truthfully, the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KEELY MOTOR.\r\n\r\nA STATEMENT FROM ONE OF THE INVENTOR'S STOCKHOLDERS.\r\n\r\n\"To the Editor of the Evening Bulletin: In your issue of last Tuesday\r\nappears an article which deserves attention, and also calls for some\r\nexplanation upon that very much misunderstood question of the Keely\r\nmotor. From some cause not easy to learn, there seems to be a tendency\r\nto keep only one side of that subject before the public.\r\n\r\n\"Being one of the unfortunates of the Keely motor speculation, interest\r\nhas led me to investigate not only the invention and the man who has\r\neverything to do with it, but also the management of the company,\r\nwhich is equally important to those who put their money into the\r\nenterprise as an investment. Permit me, therefore, to state a few of\r\nthe facts which, if known, would very much change some of the popular\r\nviews now held.\r\n\r\n\"There are perhaps a thousand stockholders in the Keely Motor\r\nCompany. The mass of these, like myself, are not the prosecutors in\r\nthis case against Mr. Keely. We do not believe that Mr. Keely can\r\nbe forced to divulge any valuable secrets if he possesses them. We\r\ndo not believe that a case in court is calculated to prolong the\r\ninventor's life, or render it more safe from the accidents to which\r\nhe is exposed. We do not believe that these proceedings are likely\r\nto increase his good will towards the company. Some of us know that\r\nby purchasing Keely motor stock, we have not thereby put our money\r\ninto the invention, nor has Mr. Keely had the benefit of it. We also\r\nknow that some, if not all, of the parties to this prosecution,\r\nespecially those who are most vehement in its favour under the\r\npretence of protecting the common stockholders, are selfish to\r\nthe last degree, while for themselves they have the least cause\r\nto complain. Their official records show an utter disregard of the\r\ninterests of stockholders or the rights of the inventor: while the\r\nsuccess of the invention is to them a secondary consideration. It\r\nis they, and not the inventor, who have drummed up the customers,\r\nand recommended and sold the stock. They, and not he, are answerable\r\nto the purchasers. If Mr. Keely is guilty of deception, they are to\r\nsay the least equally so. Look at a few statements:\r\n\r\n\"When the Keely Motor Company was started, in 1874, its organizers\r\nreceived their stock without paying for it. About three-fourths of\r\nthe whole amount were thus given away by Mr. Keely. He retained about\r\none-seventh, and was cheated out of a good portion of that before\r\nhe had gone far. Only 400 shares out of 20,000 were retained in the\r\ntreasury, and that but a short time; for these recipients of the\r\n\"dead-head stock\" made hasty havoc of the market by a rapid unloading\r\nof their shares and pocketing the proceeds. So the poor little 400\r\nshares of treasury stock brought only the minimum price to afford\r\ntemporary relief to a distressed company.\r\n\r\n\"The bankrupt condition of this incipient corporation threatened it\r\nwith a cessation of existence, unless somebody came to the rescue,\r\nfor the 'originals,' who had received a harvest by the sale of their\r\n'free stock,' would not now give a dollar to save the concern. They\r\nwere all fixed, but what of the innocent stockholders who had purchased\r\nthis stock? They should not be allowed to suffer, as they must if the\r\ncompany went out. So Mr. Keely came to the rescue, and consented to\r\nthe following scheme, which was prepared by schemers, as the sequel\r\nproved. He had two inventions besides the motor, and they could be\r\nhandled to advantage in this emergency. These Mr. Keely assigned\r\nto the company, and the stock was increased from 20,000 to 100,000\r\nshares. The 80,000 new shares were to be divided equally: 40,000 to\r\npay for the inventions, and 40,000 went to the company without one\r\ndollar of pay. So, Mr. Keely received no money in this transaction;\r\nand of the 40,000 shares which he should have received, not 5000\r\never reached him; fraudulent claims having captured the rest while\r\nin the hands of the 'trustee.' Of the 5000 shares also, much had\r\nbeen obligated in advance by the inventor to carry forward the work\r\nwhich otherwise must have been delayed, so that he had less than 1000\r\nshares left when all claims were settled. This grand act is called the\r\n'consolidation,' which took place in 1879, and since which all moneys\r\nraised by the company have come from the sale of shares out of this\r\n40,000, which Mr. Keely then gave to the company. By some mysterious\r\noperations in the 'management' this 'Treasury Stock' has shrunk\r\naway very rapidly, bringing at times only a fraction of the price\r\nwhich other stocks of the same kind were selling for in the market,\r\nwhile the little cash which it has brought has only in part been used\r\nby Mr. Keely, and that has been served out to him in a sparing way,\r\nwhich would be shameful even if he had not furnished it all to begin\r\nwith. The company now owe to Mr. Keely fifty thousand dollars loaned\r\noutright in its early history. To this indebtedness considerable\r\nhas since been added. The public statements that Mr. Keely has been\r\nsupplied with large amounts of money from the company are untrue,\r\nwhile it is true that of those who are regarded as his dupes a half\r\ndozen or more have made on an average at least $50,000 each from the\r\n'enterprise.' The money with which Mr. Keely capitalized the company,\r\nin the first place, was obtained from the sale of territorial rights\r\nto men who have formed other companies for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"If Mr. Keely deserves prosecution by any parties, it is those who\r\nbought these rights, and not the ring who now control the company\r\nwith stock which has cost them nothing.\r\n\r\n\"If anybody deserves to be sued by the stockholders it is these\r\nvery persons who recommended and sold them the stock, and have taken\r\nthe benefit of it, and who at the same time are responsible for the\r\nmiserable management which has caused detention of the work, distress\r\nin the company, depreciation in the stock and dissatisfaction among\r\nstockholders.\r\n\r\n\"One.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe further history of \"The Keely Motor Bubble\" will be given later on,\r\nbut it is the position in earlier years, that we must first deal with,\r\nto get a clear comprehension of the causes of the delays which again\r\nand again shattered the hopes of the sanguine investors just when\r\nthey were the most buoyant, from an apparent increased control of\r\nthe mysterious force Keely was handling. Further quotations from the\r\npress will best show the light in which Keely's work was regarded by\r\nthose who considered themselves competent to pass judgment upon him\r\nand his efforts. The Daily News in Philadelphia, on May 25th, 1886,\r\ncontained a most sensible editorial, with the heading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has Keely Discovered?\r\n\r\n\"For a number of years Mr. John W. Keely, of this city, and various\r\nassociates have occupied the attention of the public to a greater\r\nor less extent, from time to time. The claim on behalf of Mr. Keely\r\nis that he has discovered a new motive power, so far transcending\r\nall previous achievements in this direction, as to overturn most of\r\nthe universally recognized conclusions regarding dynamics. Of course\r\nsuch a claim was sure to be met with derision, and the derision was\r\nsure of continuance until silenced by the most thorough practical\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n\"Discussion of the matter has not seemed profitable in the absence of\r\nsuch a demonstration; but now it seems proper to note an apparently\r\nnew status of Mr. Keely's affairs, as shown by some experiments\r\nconducted last Saturday in the presence of a number of visitors. Some,\r\nat least, of these visitors were qualified for critical observation,\r\nand the noteworthy fact is that Mr. Keely was able to produce, under\r\ntheir close inspection, a dynamic result which none of them pretended\r\nto account for by any known law of physics, outside of that which\r\nMr. Keely claims as the base of his operation. He evolved, almost\r\ninstantaneously, according to the united report of those who were\r\npresent, a substance having an elastic energy varying from 10,000 to\r\n20,000 pounds per square inch, and instantly discharged or liberated it\r\ninto the atmosphere, without the evolution of heat in its production,\r\nor of cold on its sudden liberation. These phenomena alone would\r\nseem to establish that the substance he is dealing with is one not\r\nhitherto known to science.\r\n\r\n\"It seems rather frivolous to dismiss this matter with the supposition\r\nthat trained specialists are to be hoodwinked by concealed springs,\r\nburied pipes for the introduction of compressed air and the\r\nlike. Surely such gentlemen ought very easily to determine at once\r\nwhether the surroundings and conditions of the experiments were such\r\nas to favour any kind of legerdemain; and if they found them so, it\r\nis strange that they should spend some hours in investigating that\r\nwhich has been asserted to be 'a transparent humbug.'\r\n\r\n\"The appearances are that Mr. Keely has at least removed his enterprise\r\nfrom the domain of ridicule to that of respectful investigation,\r\nand this, after all, is great progress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, July 28th, 1886, the Public Ledger had a leader headed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us have some actual useful Work.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the occasional revivals of the Keely motor, whether\r\nannual, semi-annual, or biennial, as they have come along in the\r\nlast ten or a dozen years, the Ledger has paid but little attention\r\nto them for a long time; and possibly this last display last week\r\nmight have been allowed to take the same unnoticed course, but that\r\nthe \"whizz\" of the big sphere seems to have been so rapid, and the\r\nracket so stunning, as to more greatly puzzle those present at the\r\nexhibition than on any former occasion. The matter for a long time\r\nhas presented itself to us in but two aspects mainly. First, there\r\nwas large public interest in the asserted development of physical\r\nforce by new and very strange means--very interesting if there really\r\nwas a probability of a new device or new means of developing power\r\nthat could be harnessed and made to do useful work; and second, so\r\nfar as the matter took the form of exploiting a private enterprise\r\nor stimulating a boom for a private speculation, there was but very\r\nlimited interest for the public. In this latter aspect it was almost\r\nexclusively an affair between Mr. Keely and the stockholders of his\r\ncompany, who felt willing to back their faith in the substantiality of\r\nhis invention or discovery, by investing their money in the company's\r\nstock. This was no affair for a public journal to meddle in, unless\r\nsome imposture was designed that might affect the general public.\r\n\r\n\"That is the way the Ledger has regarded the matter for several\r\nyears; and, as during that period it seemed to be almost exclusively\r\na private matter of little public interest, we have had little or\r\nno concern with it. Of course the Ledger stood ready all the time,\r\nas it stands now ready, to welcome anything that promises to be\r\nuseful or of advantage in any way as an addition to the mechanical\r\nor other working facilities of our day. That Mr. Keely might have a\r\nclue to such an addition we did not dispute on the mere ground that\r\nit was new or strange, or because experts pronounced it impossible;\r\nfor many stranger things have happened. Mankind, even those who\r\nare illumined by the highest human knowledge and intelligence,\r\ndo not yet know all that is to be known, as we are reminded almost\r\nevery day by the strides of scientific and mechanical progress. We\r\nwould rather have found Mr. Keely less inclined to be mysterious;\r\nwe could have wished him to have been less disposed to talk in terms\r\nthat sound very like meaningless jargon to most well-informed persons;\r\nbut still we did not think it proper, or fair, or wise, to reject his\r\nclaims on these grounds, but have simply let them rest in abeyance,\r\nso far as the Ledger is concerned, because behind all this, and behind\r\nmany more such essays, is the possibility that the success of some one\r\nof them may solve the problem of what is to be done when the world's\r\nsupply of fuel, whether in form of wood, or coal, or peat, or gas,\r\nis either practically exhausted or to be got at only at a cost that\r\nwould largely preclude its use. Mr. Keely, we say, may have a clue\r\nto that, as also may some one of those who are experimenting with\r\nthe several manifestations of electric or magnetic force.\r\n\r\n\"What we would have had Mr. Keely do, and, until he does it, his\r\noperations have but little practical value in the sight of the Ledger,\r\nwould have been to harness his motor to do some useful work, to gear\r\nit by cogwheel or by belt and pulley, or by some other mechanical\r\ndevice, to a main shaft that has driving lathes, or planers, or other\r\nmachines--something that was doing actual useful work, day in and\r\nday out, as other machines do. Of machines that will manifest great\r\npressure on a gauge, of contrivances that have enormous lifting power,\r\nof explosives that demonstrate stupendous force, the appliances of\r\nscience and the mechanic arts have large numbers, and they are handier\r\nand more manageable than any Mr. Keely has shown. These are not to\r\nthe point--except, perhaps, to persons endowed with large faith. The\r\nmachine that will do actual, useful, large work, by a manipulation of\r\nnew energy, or by a display of energy by new and manageable means,\r\nthis or these are the things the public and the Ledger will be glad\r\nto hail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Keely had not reached that stage in his researches\r\nwhen he could carry out the suggestions made by the able writer of the\r\nLedger leader; and if our discoverer of an unknown force had not been\r\nknown to some persons \"endowed with large faith\" in his discovery,\r\nit would have been lost to the world. An anonymous writer has said\r\nthe idea that living nature is not a collection of dead-heads, never\r\nseems to have struck the non-progressivists. The thing that is has\r\nbeen, and the thing that is will continue to be; this is the sum and\r\nsubstance of the doctrine they profess. They commit the mistake of\r\nsupposing they live in a finished planet when in reality they exist\r\non an orb that has relatively just begun to live. The time allowed\r\nus for observation and study of nature and of ourselves, is limited\r\nin a marked degree. Just when we are beginning to know how to read\r\nthe book, we are forced to close its pages because the intellectual\r\neyesight finds itself within the trammels of age. All we can do is to\r\nmake a hit here, and a hit there, and to hand on our little bit of\r\nintelligence to those who come after us, in the hope that they also\r\nwill keep their eyes and ears open, and, in like manner, hand on a\r\ncumulative store of knowledge to their heirs and successors. During\r\nthe brief span of a man's existence, then, it is difficult for him\r\nto prove much progress either in himself or in his surroundings. The\r\neternal hills seem the same to him when the light of life dies out,\r\nas when first his eyes beheld their outlines. Stern, uncompromising,\r\napparently immutable, the hills remain to him the type of all that\r\nis fixed, all that is unchangeable around. Yet this is not the story\r\nof science. Tennyson, who is always true to nature, says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"The hills are shadows, and they flow\r\n        From form to form, and nothing stands;\r\n        They melt like mists, the solid lands;\r\n        Like clouds they shape themselves and go.\"\r\n\r\n                        In Memoriam, cxxiii., 2nd Stanza.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is good poetry; better still, it is good science.\r\n\r\nThe Himalayas, big and grand as they are, must represent mountains\r\nwhose rise was a thing of a very \"recent\" date, geologically\r\nspeaking. This is proved, because we see rocks belonging to a\r\nrelatively recent age, appearing as part and parcel of their lofty\r\npeaks. Very different is the case with the hills and mountains of,\r\nsay, north-western Scotland. There you come upon peaks of an age\r\nwell-nigh coëval with the world's earliest settling down to a steady,\r\nsolid, and respectable existence. The Scottish hills are the old,\r\nthe very old, aristocrats of the cosmical circle; the Himalayas,\r\nAlps, and the rest, are the new race whose origin goes not further\r\nback than a generation, as it were.\r\n\r\nYet, about the oldest of the mountains there is nothing which is\r\nabsolutely enduring. Equally with the newer hills, geological progress\r\nand action are written on the face of their history. The hills are\r\nonly phases of cosmical arrangement; they are here in the to-day\r\nof the world; they may be gone in the world's to-morrow. Before\r\nScience had learned to lisp this, the prophetic word of men moved\r\nby the Holy Ghost had said: \"Of old Thou hast laid the foundations\r\nof the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands. They shall\r\nperish, but Thou remainest; yea, all of them shall wax old like a\r\ngarment, and as a vesture shalt Thou change them and they shall be\r\nchanged.\" The world is neither perfect nor finished in a geological\r\nsense, any more than it is perfect in an ethical sense. It is full\r\nof progressive action everywhere, and, to quote from another author,\r\n\"our planet and our solar system are but as the small dust of the\r\nbalance in the colossal scale of the worlds that are.\"\r\n\r\nHad there been no one to read the future in the light of the past,\r\namong those who witnessed the production of the force discovered\r\nby Keely in 1872, he could not have continued his researches, as\r\nhe has done during these intervening years, from lack of the funds\r\nnecessary to carry them on. But there were men who knew the worth\r\nof the discovery, and who, sanguine as to almost immediate results,\r\ndid something more than stand idly \"ready to welcome\" them when\r\nproduced. They furnished the money with which Keely laboured year after\r\nyear, and encouraged him to persevere, when without such aid he might\r\nhave been forced to abandon his researches for want of the necessaries\r\nof life. During this period, Keely's discovery was only thought of\r\nin reference to its commercial value, and for a decade he made no\r\nprogress: but, after his researches led up to the conviction that he\r\nwas on the road to another and infinitely more important discovery,\r\nnamely, the source of life and the connecting link between intelligent\r\nwill and matter, his progress has been almost uninterrupted. His\r\nambition is not only to give a costless motive power to the world,\r\nbut to make clear to men of science the path he is exploring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1882 TO 1886.\r\n\r\nETHER THE TRUE PROTOPLASM, AN EPITOME OF MACVICAR'S SKETCH OF A\r\nPHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\n        All that has been predicted of atoms, their attractions and\r\n        repulsions, according to the primary laws of their being,\r\n        only becomes intelligible when we assume the presence of\r\n        mind.--Sir John F. W. Herschell (1865).\r\n\r\n        It is in no small degree reassuring to find that we are\r\n        not chained to inert matter, but to the living energies\r\n        of its forms.... This leads us to the inference, long\r\n        suspected, that all matter, as well as the ethereal medium\r\n        itself consists ultimately of one and the same primordial\r\n        element.--Col. A. T. Fraser, Darkness and Light in the Land\r\n        of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor ten years Keely's demonstrations were confined to the liberation,\r\nat will, of the energy he had \"stumbled over\" while experimenting on\r\nvibrations in 1872; and his efforts were put forth for the construction\r\nof \"the perfect engine,\" which he had promised to The Keely Motor\r\nCompany. He made the mistake of pursuing his researches on the line of\r\ninvention instead of discovery. All his thoughts were concentrated in\r\nthis direction up to the year 1882. Engine after engine was abandoned\r\nand sold as old metal, in his repeated failures to construct one that\r\nwould keep up the rotary motion of the ether that was necessary to\r\nhold it in any structure. Explosion after explosion occurred, sometimes\r\nharmless to him, at other times laying him up for weeks at a time.\r\n\r\nTwo more years were lost in efforts to devise an automatic arrangement,\r\nwhich should enable the machine, invented by Keely for liberating\r\nthe energy, to be handled by any operator, and it was not until 1884\r\nthat steady progress was seen, from year to year, as the result of his\r\nenlarged researches. When Keely was asked, at this time, how long he\r\nthought it would be before he would have the engine he was then at work\r\nupon ready to patent, he illustrated his situation by an anecdote:\r\n\"A man fell down, one dark night, into a mine; catching a rope in\r\nhis descent, he clung to it until morning. With the first glimpse of\r\ndaylight, he saw that had he let go his hold of the rope he would have\r\nhad but a few inches to fall. I am precisely in the situation of that\r\nman. I do not know how near success may be, nor yet how far off it is.\"\r\n\r\nAugust 5th, 1885, the New York Home Journal announced that Keely had\r\nimprisoned the ether; and, as was then wrongly supposed, that the\r\nunknown force was the ether itself; not the medium of the force, as it\r\nis now known to be. The late George Perry, who was then editor of that\r\njournal, heralded the announcement with these comments:--\"No object\r\nseems to be too high or remote for human endeavour. It is not strange\r\nthat some of these attempts should stagger the faith of all but the\r\nboldest imaginations. A notable example of this class is the famous\r\netheric motor invented by Keely, of Philadelphia, and the subject\r\nof a communication which we print below from a well-known American\r\nlady in Italy. The inventor claims to have found a new force, one\r\nthat entirely transcends those that have been hitherto appropriated\r\nfor human use. Heat, steam, electricity, magnetism are but crude\r\nantetypes of this new discovery. It is essentially the creator of\r\nthese forces. It is scarcely less than the 'primum mobile.'\r\n\r\nIndeed in reading the exposition of its potentialities one can hardly\r\nhelp doubting whether the concrete matter of our earth is not too\r\nweak and volatile to contain, restrain, and direct this vast cosmic\r\nenergy except in infinitesimal proportions. How shall iron and steel\r\nstand before the power which builds up and clasps the very atoms of\r\ntheir mass? Where shall the inventor look for 'safety discs' to stay\r\nhis new-found force, when every substance within his reach is but\r\na residuum of the activity of this identical principle? How shall\r\nstrength of materials avail against the power that gives, and indeed\r\nis, strength of materials? This, however, is but a metaphysical doubt,\r\nand as the invention has already demonstrated its practical efficiency\r\non a small scale, there is a presumption that it may be extended to\r\nthe higher degrees. At all events, whether the force can or cannot\r\nbe harnessed to do the daily work of the world, the discovery is\r\none that will mark an epoch in the progress of science and give the\r\ninventor and his patrons a meed of immortality. Granted they are but\r\npoets building a lofty cosmical rhyme, their work shall have not the\r\nless an enduring honour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Force--Etheric Vapour.\r\n\r\nThe discoverer of a hitherto unknown force in nature which, when\r\ncertain inventions are perfected, will create a revolution in science,\r\nas well as in mechanics, has for many years concentrated his mind upon\r\ngaining supreme control over one of nature's greatest and grandest\r\nforces. Or, more correctly speaking, in efforts to control and apply to\r\nmechanics one of the various manifestations of the one force in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The force which binds the atoms, which controls secreting glands,\r\n    Is the same that guides the planets, acting by divine commands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical ether conceived of by scientists, to account for the\r\ntransmission of light, is not hypothetical to this discoverer. He\r\nknows its nature and its power. By the operation of an instrument\r\nof his own invention, he can release it at will from the suspension\r\nin which it is always held in our atmosphere. It is so liberated,\r\nby an almost instantaneous process of intense vibratory action, and\r\npassed through a tube the opening of which is no larger than a pin's\r\nhead, furnishing sufficient power to run a one hundred horse-power\r\nengine. The importance of this discovery cannot be conceived; its limit\r\nseems boundless; its value cannot be put in figures. Step by step,\r\nwith a patient perseverance which one day the world will honour, this\r\nman of genius has made his researches, fighting with and overcoming\r\ndifficulties which seemed insurmountable, during years in which no\r\ndisinterested hands were extended to aid him, no encouraging words\r\nof appreciation bestowed upon him by the scientists whom he vainly\r\ntried to interest in his experiments; assailed by calumnies, which,\r\nemanating from those who should have been the first to extend aid,\r\nhave over and over pierced his noble heart like poisoned arrows.\r\n\r\nHistory will not forget that, in the nineteenth century, the story of\r\nPrometheus found a counterpart, and that the greatest man of the age,\r\nseeking to scale the heavens to bring down blessings for mankind,\r\nmet with Prometheus's reward from the vultures of calumny who, up to\r\nthe present moment, have not spared their talons upon him.\r\n\r\nThe dangerous conditions attending the introductory features of the\r\ndevelopment of etheric vapour are not yet entirely overcome; but this\r\nthrows no shadow of a doubt as to the inventor's eventual success in\r\nthe minds of those who know the magnitude of the difficulties he has\r\nalready mastered.\r\n\r\nO. W. Babcock, in an American journal says of this discovery, \"Human\r\ncomprehension is inadequate to grasp its possibilities or power, for\r\nprosperity and for peace. It includes all that relates mechanically to\r\ntravel, manufacture, mining, engineering and warfare. The discoverer\r\nhas entered a new world, and although an unexplored wilderness\r\nof untold wealth lies beyond, he is treading firmly its border,\r\nwhich daily widens as with ever-increasing interest he pursues his\r\nexplorations. He has passed the dreary realm where scientists are\r\ngroping. His researches are made in the open field of elemental\r\nforce, where gravity, inertia, cohesion, momentum are disturbed in\r\ntheir haunts and diverted to use; where, from the unity of origin,\r\nemanates infinite energy in its diversified forms,\" and to this I\r\nwould add--where he, the discoverer, is able to look from nature\r\nup to nature's God, understanding and explaining, as no mortal ever\r\nbefore understood and explained, how simple is the way in which God\r\n\"works His wonders to perform.\"\r\n\r\nA compilation of Macvicar's \"Sketch of a Philosophy,\" entitled \"Ether\r\nthe true Protoplasm,\" was sent to Mr. Keely; and shortly after,\r\nMrs. Hughes' book on the evolution of tones and colours. Mr. Keely\r\nwill himself, in his theoretical exposé make known the manner in\r\nwhich he was led, by the writings of Dr. Macvicar and Mrs. Hughes,\r\ninto the knowledge which raised the veil that had before hidden from\r\nhim the operations of Nature with this \"the most powerful and most\r\ngeneral of all her forces;\" operations which will explain all that\r\nis now mysterious to us in the workings of gravity.\r\n\r\nThe question has been asked whether science, having destroyed faith,\r\nhas supplied us with anything better. But has science destroyed\r\nfaith? Certainly not. There would be no such thing as counterfeit\r\ncoin were it not for the existence of sterling gold. True science\r\nhas its counterfeit, and it is due to spurious science that the\r\nbulwarks of religious faith have been besieged; but they are not\r\ndestroyed. Drummond says that it will be the splendid task of the\r\nfuture theology to disclose to scepticism the naturalness of the\r\nsupernatural.\r\n\r\nThe pure Philosophy which true science seems about to reveal discloses\r\nnot a universe of dead matter, but a universe alive from its core\r\nto its outermost extremity, and animated by mind and means, to which\r\nmatter, perfectly organized, is absolutely subservient. It illuminates\r\nmysteries of nature which have only been partially revealed to us,\r\nand lifts the veil which has hitherto shrouded in darkness still\r\ngreater mysteries involved in this universal power, which keeps and\r\nsustains all systems of worlds in their relation towards each and\r\nall. More and more clearly shall we be led by true science to see\r\nthat the universe \"is founded upon a distinct idea,\" and that the\r\nharmony of this distinct idea is manifested in all of God's works. Sir\r\nIsaac Newton, in his \"Fundamental Principles of Natural Philosophy,\"\r\ncalls the great magnetic agent \"the soul of the world,\" and says,\r\n\"all senses are excited by this spirit, and through it the animals\r\nmove their limbs; but these things cannot be explained in few words,\r\nand we have not yet sufficient experience to determine fully the laws\r\nby which this universal spirit operates.\" Centuries may pass before\r\nthese laws will be \"fully understood\"; but Etheric Philosophy casts\r\na plummet into depths that have never been sounded, and reveals this\r\n\"unparticled substance,\" \"the cosmic matter,\" \"the primal stuff,\"\r\n\"the celestial ocean of universal ether,\" as the true protoplasm,\r\nand the medium by which mind shapes matter and gives it all its\r\nproperties. It teaches us that, through it, we are connected in\r\nsympathy with all other souls and with all the objects of nature, even,\r\nto the stars and all the heavenly bodies. But even though we do not\r\nunderstand the laws which control its operations, we find therein\r\na legitimate field of research. It is surely more legitimate for\r\nscience to ascribe failures in such researches to our still existing\r\nignorance of that which we may possibly know in time than to set such\r\nlaws down as unknowable. \"Thought in its spontaneity has the run of\r\nthe universe, and there should be no bar to discovery.\" Our only hope,\r\nsays Macvicar, lies in the universality of the cosmical laws and the\r\nultimate homogeneity of created substances, or reality.\r\n\r\nIn stating some of the various hypotheses which have been put forward\r\nby Macvicar, more as a sketch than as a new system of philosophy,\r\nit is not necessary to make any comments. If the scaffolding be good\r\nthe edifice will appear in time. If worthless, no edifice can be\r\nconstructed. Therefore, it must be remembered that it is only with the\r\nscaffolding that we have to do at present. If it has been left for our\r\nage to demonstrate the truth or the falsity of certain deductions made\r\nin past ages--if we arrive at a partial knowledge, even, of truths\r\nwhich ancient wisdom saw with dim vision, we must never forget that\r\nour century has had the benefit of the light reflected down the stream\r\nof time. Macvicar's \"Sketch of a Philosophy\" was published in 1868. He\r\nsaid that his ideas would not be acceptable, or even intelligible, to\r\nan age when the popular demand is for very light reading; when science\r\nis marvellously content with the attainments which it has already\r\nmade; and when, \"as to the method of science we are told, with more\r\nand more confidence every day, that all we can do for the discovery of\r\nrealities is to go out of doors, leaving 'the inner man' all alone,\r\nand to compare the odour of the present with the smell of the past,\r\nand then, turning our noses towards the future, to follow them wherever\r\nthey may lead us.\" He continues, Sensation, we are taught, is the alone\r\narchitect of all trustworthy knowledge; the author both as to form and\r\nsubstance of all that is belief-worthy. No such thing as intuition,\r\nwe are told; reason merely a habit, rising from the long-continued use\r\nof the organism. This looking only to mechanism is as much the plague\r\nand sorrow of our times as it was when Macvicar complained of it as\r\ndivorcing science from philosophy. Philosophic wisdom, says Willcox, is\r\na structure built up of all knowledges--grand and sublime: permanent,\r\nnot of the present nor the past. Science holds, in its relation to\r\nphilosophy, the same position that theology sustains to religion. \"En\r\ndehors de toutes les sciences spéciales et au-dessus d'elles, il y\r\na lieu à une science plus haute et plus générale, et, c'est ce qu'\r\non appelle philosophie.\"--(Paul Janet, Revue des Deux Mondes.)\r\n\r\nOf what nature are the ideas which Macvicar was so sure would be\r\nunpopular? In compiling from his writings, such are selected as\r\nseem to be the best, toward elucidating the mysteries which lie\r\nin the operation of the laws governing the universal ether, so far\r\nas his hypotheses carried him. If matter without form preceded the\r\ncreation of vitality, \"it is only when the principle of life had been\r\ngiven,\" says Charpignon, \"that the intrinsic properties of atoms\r\nwere compelled, by the law of affinities, to form individualities;\r\nwhich, from that moment, becoming a centre of action, were enabled\r\nto act as modifying causes of the principle of life, and assimilate\r\nthemselves to it, according to the ends of their creation.\" Here is\r\na conjecture, to start with, that it will be well to remember; for,\r\nas in the hypotheses of Macvicar and the demonstrations of Keely,\r\nthe law of assimilation is made the pivot upon which all turns,\r\n\"providing at once for the free and the forced, at once for mind\r\nand for matter, and placing them in a scientific relationship to one\r\nanother.\" This law Macvicar calls the \"cosmical law,\" because to it\r\nalone, ever operating under the eye and fulfilling the design of\r\nthe great Creator who is always and in all places immanent to His\r\ncreation, an appeal is ever made. By this law a far greater number\r\nof the phenomena of nature and the laboratory can be explained than\r\nhave been otherwise explained by scores of laws which are frankly\r\nadmitted to be empirical. Surely this is no slight claim for this law\r\nto be studied, with a view to its acceptance or rejection. To repeat,\r\nthis law is to the effect that every individualized object tends to\r\nassimilate itself to itself, in successive moments of its existence,\r\nand all objects to assimilate one another. The ground of it is, that\r\nthe simple and pure substance of creation, has for its special function\r\nto manifest the Creator; and consequently to assimilate itself to His\r\nwill and attributes, in so far as the finite can assimilate itself to\r\nthe Infinite. Hence it is, in its own nature, wholly plastic or devoid\r\nof fixed innate properties, and wholly assimilative, both with respect\r\nto its own portions or parts and to surrounding objects, as well as\r\nto its position in space, and, in so far as it is capable, to the\r\nmind of the Creator. Thus, there immediately awake, in the material\r\nelements, individuality and the properties of sphericity, elasticity,\r\nand inertia, along with a tendency to be assimilated as to place, or,\r\nas it is commonly called, reciprocal attraction. Hence, in the first\r\nplace, the construction in the ether, or realm of light, of groups\r\nof ethereal elements, generating material elements. Hence, secondly,\r\na tendency in the material elements, when previously distributed\r\nin space, to form into groups, in which their ethereal atmospheres\r\nmay become completely confluent; while their material nuclei, being\r\npossessed of a more powerful individuality than ethereal elements,\r\ncome into juxtaposition merely, thus constituting molecules. By\r\nlegitimate deductions from cosmical law, the forms and structures\r\nof these molecules must always be as symmetrical as the reaction of\r\ntheir own constituent particles, and that of their surroundings, will\r\nallow. The law of assimilation gives the same results as mathematics\r\nin determining the forms of systems of equal, and similar, elastic\r\nand reciprocally attractive spherical forces, or centres of force,\r\nwhen they have settled in a state of equilibrium; proving these forms\r\nto be symmetrical in the highest degree. Here, however, Macvicar\r\nand Keely differ, in hypothesis, as to the structure of the ultimate\r\nmaterial element; but this difference does not affect \"the scaffolding\"\r\nof pure philosophy, in which everything that is cognizable has its\r\nown place, is on a solid basis, is harmonious with its surroundings,\r\nand is explained and justified by them:--raising chemistry to the\r\nlevel and bringing it within the sphere of mechanics; investing its\r\nobjects, at the same time, with all the distinctness of the objects\r\nof other branches of natural science.\r\n\r\nBecause the chemist in his laboratory cannot succeed in decomposing\r\ncertain substances, it has been inferred that they are essentially\r\nundecomposable, simple and untransformable; and on this hypothesis\r\nthe whole science of mineralogy proceeds. But when it is considered\r\nthat all of these chemical atoms, before they have come into the\r\nchemist's hands, have been securely consolidated and mineralized, so\r\nas to be able to withstand the ordeal of the volcano and the central\r\nheat, compared with which the most powerful analytic agencies of\r\nthe laboratory are but a mimicry, is it for a moment to be supposed,\r\nalthough their internal structure were still molecular, that they would\r\nbreak down in the chemist's hands? Surely, all his containing vessels,\r\nwhich are but things of human art, must go to pieces before them.\r\n\r\nThe present prevailing theory of development contradicts one half\r\nby the other half. It extends the doctrine of development and\r\ntransmutation to species which happen to be visible to such eyes as\r\nwe have; it denies it to such as happen to be invisible to us. If\r\nall animals and plants have been obtained by the secular synthesis of\r\ntransformed monera, and the differentiation of the organs composing\r\nthem--thus giving in the last analysis one form and kind of protoplasm\r\nas the root of all; the pursuit of the same line of thought--the\r\nsame theory, applied to the atoms of the chemist, with their various\r\nproperties and atomic weights, gives, as the common ground of all, a\r\nsingle material element; each chemical atom being a structure composed\r\nof this material element, but so stable as to be indecomposable in the\r\nlaboratory. Let this be granted, as asserted by Macvicar in 1868, and\r\nby Keely now, and the theory of evolution, whatever may be the case as\r\nto its cogency, at least possesses a scientific form. It is no longer\r\na conception which breaks down midway between its first and its last\r\nterms. But letting science, in this respect, stand for the present as\r\nit is, and supposing the seventy recognized elements of the laboratory\r\n(which do not include the twenty or more new elements recently said to\r\nhave been discovered by Krüss and Nilson in certain rare Scandinavian\r\nminerals) or rather, perhaps, some very high multiple of their number\r\nto constitute that cosmic gas from which the solar system has been\r\nevolved, the theory of development shows itself to be as imperfect\r\non the great scale, and in point of extent, as it is in point of\r\nhomogeneity in its intimate material. Macvicar continues--Beyond\r\nthat cosmic gas there certainly is the ether, a medium which no\r\nlonger can be ignored in any physical theory of nature. What, then,\r\nis the relation of the cosmic gas to the ether? Evolutionists do not\r\nanswer this question, but Macvicar seeks to render the whole system\r\nof thought homogeneous, and to show that, just as all organisms are\r\nthe synthetic developments of one kind of moneron, and all chemical\r\natoms and molecules the synthetic development of one kind of material\r\nelement, so is the material element a synthetic development of ethereal\r\nelements. These also are Mr. Keely's views; but neither Macvicar nor\r\nKeely rest in the conception of a congeries of particles which are\r\nwholly blind and devoid of feeling and thought, diffused throughout all\r\nspace, believing such particles to be the first of things. \"Reason,\r\nif it is to enjoy intellectual repose, can have it only in finding,\r\nbeyond and above all things else, a unity, a power, intelligence,\r\npersonality--in one word, God. This is the only legitimate haven\r\nof a theory of development: sending back the tide of materialism and\r\npantheism which has swept its mire over our age into the ebb again; as,\r\nafter having reached the full, it has so often done already, before\r\nthe constitutional instincts or inspirations of humanity, with which\r\nspeculative minds may, indeed, dally for a generation but which are\r\nultimately inexorable.\" Macvicar maintains with Keely that from God,\r\nas the Author of all, nature may be reached with those very features\r\nwhich it is seen to possess; that it is essential to every philosophy,\r\nwhich is or shall be in harmony with intelligence, that it shall be\r\nbased upon a unity; that no philosophy possesses all the claims to\r\nintellectual regard which it may possibly have, unless that unity be\r\nan intelligent Being; that to suppose thought and feeling to wake\r\nup for the first time in that which was previously blind and dead\r\nfrom all eternity, is nothing short of absurd to those who are led\r\nby the evidence of design, to look from nature up to nature's God,\r\nin whom all nature lives and moves and has its being.\r\n\r\nWhile the protoplasm of the biologist is a substance which is more\r\nor less opaque or visible, the protoplasm now conceived of as the\r\nmaterial of the whole creation in its first state, when development\r\nis to begin, must, on the contrary, be altogether homogeneous and\r\ninvisible. But none the less is it entitled to the name of protoplasm;\r\nnay, it alone must be justly entitled to that name, for it is the\r\nfirst of created things, and, being the product of an Almighty Being,\r\nit must be altogether plastic in His hands. It can have no constitution\r\nof its own derived from itself; but must, so far as the finite can,\r\nwith respect to the infinite, reflect, represent, embody, show forth\r\nHis attributes and being. Still, there is limitation to this. Certain\r\nproperties and demands with regard to that which exists, with limited\r\nextension, in space, are inexorable. Macvicar reasons that with such\r\nlimitations the primal substance of creation must be fully obedient or\r\nassimilated to the Creator--not in a transient manner, but permanently;\r\nand that in its nature the primal substance, the true protoplasm,\r\nmust be an assimilative substance. Granting that this protoplasm be\r\npartitioned into individualities, he makes the deduction that each and\r\nall of these individualized beings and things would, up to the full\r\nmeasure of their capacity, not only tend to assimilate themselves to\r\nthe ever-present Being to whom they owe their own being, but they would\r\ntend also to assimilate themselves each to itself, with respect both\r\nto space and time; as also that they would all tend to assimilate one\r\nanother. Taking this as the cosmical mode of action, or law, and on\r\nthe strength of this law alone, without invoking the aid of any other\r\nlaw, he attempts to explain all those phenomena to which the physicist,\r\nthe chemist, and the biologist usually address themselves. Illustrating\r\nthe manner in which this law applies itself to phenomena, he gives as\r\nthe first products of this law the perpetuation of an original mode\r\nof existence, and the establishment of permanence of properties under\r\ncertain restrictions; the ground of the remarkable persistency and\r\npermanence of well-constituted species; a general harmony and homology\r\nthroughout all creation: proceeding to illustrate its action on the\r\nmental or spiritual world; accounting for perception, remembrance,\r\nreasoning, imagining, judging, and upon all our other modes of mental\r\nactivity, as operations of the cosmical law of assimilation.\r\n\r\nIn the world of physics he gives, as illustrations of this same law\r\nof assimilation, attraction, inertia, elasticity, heredity, reversion,\r\nsymmetry culminating in sphericity or symmetrical cellularity, chemical\r\nand electrical action; especially in voltaic action the influence\r\nand the persistence of this law is most remarkably displayed. By the\r\nway of familiar illustration, he takes the original voltaic cell,\r\nand without attempting to explain how one solid, copper or platinum,\r\ncomes to be less assimilable to a liquid than another, such as\r\nzinc, he shows that just what we are to expect, from this law of\r\nassimilation, takes place--viz., that at the zinc there tends to form\r\na stratum of oxygen, and that, at the platinum, there tends to form\r\na stratum of hydrogen. Pursuing the old view as to the cause of the\r\nstate of tension induced in the dilute sulphuric acid, the continuous\r\ndecomposition of the water, the solidifying action of the zinc surface,\r\nhe confines his attention to the current of force instituted by the\r\noxygen; advancing the idea that this is not merely force in general,\r\nof which all that is to be considered is its quantity and direction;\r\nbut force, of which the form of its elements or their formative power\r\nis also to be considered;--that formative power being representative or\r\nproductive of oxygen. To the objection that such a conception is occult\r\nand mysterious, he asks if it is more occult and mysterious than what\r\nis implied and confessed to be hid under the term electricity, or in\r\nthe phenomena of heredity, or than anything else which is adduced as\r\na cause of a particular phenomenon. The cosmical law of assimilation\r\nexplains all these phenomena, and, without any special hypothesis,\r\nis precisely what is wanted, in order to render natural knowledge\r\nas a whole accessible to the student: something which puts him in\r\npossession, from the first, of a master-thought, which, if he carry\r\nit along with him, will present all nature as a harmony; explaining\r\nall that stands in need of explanation. Macvicar continues:--\r\n\r\nIf it be asked how possibly out of one law, and such a one, there could\r\narise anything like that endless variety which nature displays, the\r\nanswer is, that the law operates between two limits, poles, or points\r\nof assimilation, which are entirely dissimilar, and by two processes\r\nsimultaneously, analysis and synthesis, which are the opposites of\r\neach other. Hence it comes to pass that actual nature is a web, in\r\nwhich unity and multiplicity, identity and difference, are everywhere\r\ninterwoven, and in such harmony that nature is everywhere beautiful.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to repeat the illustrations by which Macvicar\r\nseeks to demonstrate that existence is force--self-manifesting,\r\nor spontaneously radiant, so to speak, into that which is idea,\r\nif there be a recipient of ideas, or a percipient of ideas; or,\r\nmore generally, a percipient within the sphere of its action. He\r\ndoes not prescribe any limits, in space, as to the extent of this\r\nself-manifesting power. Thus, it is one of the most certain facts\r\nin physics that every atom of this planet, nay, every atom of\r\nthe planet Neptune, whose distance from the sun is thirty times\r\nas great as our distance, manifests itself to every atom of this\r\nplanet--not, indeed, as a percept, but as the subject and the object\r\nof attraction or motion. Nay, by the aid of the ether, which is the\r\ngrand medium whereby the self-manifesting power of being is enabled\r\nto take effect at a distance when no other being is interposed,\r\nthe fixed stars manifest themselves at our planet, though their\r\ndistances be inconceivably great. Distant objects acting like all\r\nobjects assimilatively, assimilate the intervening ether and the optic\r\napparatus to themselves, and thus render themselves perceptible. This\r\nthey do, indeed, only under great limitation, imposed by the laws of\r\ninertia or motion in space, to which the ether is subject--limitation\r\nwhich, in man, it requires self-teaching and experience to remove, so\r\nthat he may perceive the object in its true forms and dimensions. But\r\nthis is only man's peculiarity, in consequence of his organic defects\r\nat birth. The chick, the day it leaves the egg, can run up with equal\r\nprecision to a crumb of bread, or to an ant's egg at a distance. And so\r\nwith all species whose myo-neuro-cerebral system functions perfectly\r\nfrom their birth. At his best, the embodied mind in man sees objects\r\nonly in perspective. But the nature of this self-manifesting power\r\nneed not be dwelt upon, since it is only the existence of this power\r\nthat is insisted upon. How far beyond the visible and tangible parts\r\nof the body, the spirit, as a power exerting some kind of action\r\nor other, extends, Macvicar thinks cannot be determined. No doubt,\r\nevery force has a centre of action; but as to the full extent in\r\nspace of a unit of natural force, as an agent of one kind or another,\r\nno limits can be assigned. Who shall tell us the boundary in the\r\noutward of that power which says \"I will,\" \"I feel,\" \"I see\"? Its\r\nmodes of acting mechanically are, no doubt, limited to the extent of\r\nthe investing organism. Nay, in order to their extending even so far,\r\nit is necessary that the unity of the organism be maintained by the\r\nhealthy integrity of the nervous system. In that case consciousness\r\nclaims all the organism as its domain; and not only when the organism\r\nis entire does it refer any pain that arises to the region that is\r\nhurt, but after a limb has been amputated, and when it exists only as\r\na phantom, consciousness still feels towards it as if it were still\r\nthe old reality. Such is the effect of habit, or present assimilation\r\nto previous practice.\r\n\r\nOur cosmical law, the law of assimilation, must determine, if\r\nnot the nature, at least the mode of action of this force--this\r\nself-manifesting power--for plainly this action must be\r\nassimilative. And that it is so, when giving rise to perception, is\r\nclearly and distinctly seen; for what is the perceiving of an object,\r\nbut the mind, as a percipient, assimilating itself to that object? and\r\nwhat is the percept or remembrance of the object, which remains in\r\nthe mind but the idea--that is, the assimilated symbol of the object,\r\nwhich, however, in consequence of the intrusion in the perception of\r\nthe mind's own activity, and of other previously acquired ideas, as\r\nalso the perceptive image is often very defective as a representation\r\nof the reality perceived? We may say that this self-manifesting power,\r\nwhich is thus the characteristic of all that exists, is the agency\r\nprovided whereby the cosmical law of assimilation shall be realized,\r\nthough the intimate nature of that agency remains, as now, wholly\r\ninscrutable. Nor can it be said to be physical until it is embodied in\r\nthe ether. In that case, it is rhythmical, or undulatory, and formally\r\nrepresentative of the object whence it emanates. But it is enough to\r\nknow that the most intimate and ultimate property--the characteristic,\r\nin short, of that which exists--is self-manifesting power. Now, the\r\nexistence of a self-manifesting power in an object implies that the\r\nobject is itself a power or force, or an aggregate of such. This is\r\nenough for the purposes of philosophy and science, and we only deceive\r\nourselves when we suppose that we can think of anything that exists\r\nand which is not at the same time a force or power....\r\n\r\nOf most things that exist, if not of all, let us say that they are\r\ncapable of existing in either of two states--the dynamical or the\r\nstatical--and that, when viewed as dynamical, they are forces or\r\npowers; when viewed as statical, they are substances. When we exhaust\r\nor think away the properties of existence, the last which vanishes\r\nis self-manifesting power in the object which exists, this property\r\nbeing such that when it vanishes so does the object to which existence\r\nwas awarded. In the science of the day it is maintained by our most\r\npopular authors and lecturers that the \"physical forces\"--taken in\r\nthe singular number, physical force--is the last word, the ultimate\r\nprinciple. The physical forces are represented as all that there is\r\nfor God, whereas they are but as the fingers of God.\r\n\r\nThe idea of antecedent design, either in reference to nature as a\r\nwhole, or in reference to any object in particular, is dropped as\r\nunscientific, or repudiated as unsound; in short, a reference to the\r\nphysical forces, is the last word permitted in any treatise, if that\r\ntreatise is to be admitted as possessing a scientific character. Or,\r\nif there be one word more, it is only the \"correlation\" of those\r\nsame physical forces, and their \"conservation,\" or persistence\r\neternally in the same amount of energy in the universe. In their\r\nown place and within their own sphere, these are physical truths,\r\nwhich are of the greatest value. The former is a wholesome relapse\r\ninto the old philosophy of nature. The latter is also a return to\r\na view which is more sound than that which was popular before the\r\ndoctrine of conservation was resuscitated.\r\n\r\nDescartes' opinion, that there was a conservation of motion in the\r\nuniverse, was demonstrated by Newton to be a mistake. Leibnitz adjusted\r\nthe truth between these great men, showing that it was not motion,\r\nbut the possibility or means of motion--in one word, energy--that\r\nwas conserved in the universe.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the conservation of energy amounts to nothing more\r\nthan this, that inasmuch as every ultimate atom of matter is perfectly\r\nelastic, so is the whole universe of atoms perfectly elastic. Hence\r\nit is a doctrine which cannot be legitimately extended beyond the\r\nmerely material sphere; except on the assumption that matter is the\r\nonly reality, and that there is no such thing as a spiritual world\r\nat all--an assumption which, however often it has been made, serves\r\nonly to awaken a prevailing voice to the contrary, and the firm vote\r\nof a large majority to the effect that mind exists as well as matter.\r\n\r\nTaking the law of assimilation as the cosmical law, together with\r\nself-manifesting power as the characteristic of being, we reach a\r\nprimary classification of created objects, which corresponds with\r\nthat which is known as mind and matter--or rather let us say mind\r\nand that which is not mind; for there is ground for the apprehension\r\nthat mind and matter do not include all that exists; and that, along\r\nwith matter, ether ought to be considered as something intimately\r\nrelated to matter indeed, but yet not just matter. When the elements\r\nof the ethereal medium are regarded as truly and simply material,\r\nhowever small and light they may be, the elasticity and pressure\r\nwhich must be assigned to that medium in order to admit of the\r\nvelocity of light, are altogether out of the harmony of things,\r\nand wholly incredible, especially when confronted with the phenomena\r\nand the theory of astronomy. Thus, to justify the velocity of light\r\non the same principles as those of sound, in various material media,\r\nthe ethereal pressure must be 122,400,000,000 times greater than that\r\nof the atmosphere--which is incredible, says Macvicar.\r\n\r\nBut what as to mind? To find what shall be called mind, let us\r\nsuppose an individualized object which is not an isolated object, or\r\na universe to itself, but a member in a system; then, in obedience to\r\nwhat has been stated, that object must be at once self-manifesting and\r\nimpressed by the other objects around it, and, in being so impressed,\r\nassimilated to them more or less.... Admitting the self-manifesting\r\npower to be sensitive, percipient, or conscious, then quantity or\r\nintensity of substance or power in a monad is the condition requisite\r\nfor feeling and thought. And thus, by an immediate co-ordination of our\r\nfundamental ideas of self-manifesting power and assimilative action,\r\nmore or less, we reach a distinct conception of mind viewed in relation\r\nwith that which is not mind. By this deduction, the primeval created\r\nsubstance, the true protoplasm is still supposed to be homogeneous,\r\nanimated by its assimilation to the everlasting, the Infinite.\r\n\r\nThis protoplasm is partitioned in varying degrees so that there\r\nare in creation some individualized or separate objects or forces\r\nconsisting of so small an amount or such weakness of substance that\r\nthey are wholly fixed and merely perceptible, while there are others\r\nconsisting of so much more that they are free in their inner life, and\r\nhave power to perceive themselves also--not, indeed, in the centres of\r\ntheir being, and as unimpressed and without ideas, but as members in a\r\nsystem, impressed or assimilated by other objects, and so having ideas,\r\nwith power to look in this direction or that, and to act accordingly.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, according to Macvicar, is the nature of mind or spirit. It\r\nis a being so constituted as to be at once in possession of ideas, and\r\nso far fixed; and also in possession of undetermined life or activity,\r\nand so far free. These are, as it were, the opposite poles of its\r\nbeing, and the conditions of its activity. If either is wanting,\r\nthe other vanishes. Without something fixed in the mind, some object\r\nof thought or feeling, there can be no thinking or feeling. Without\r\nsomething unfixed there can be nothing to think or to feel with,\r\nmuch less can there be any thinking or feeling of self--that is,\r\nself-consciousness. But, grant this condition in the individual,\r\nand add the law of assimilation, operating first from God above, thus\r\ngiving reason and conscience, on the higher aspect of our being; and,\r\nsecondly, from nature around, thus giving observation and instincts\r\nharmonious with our situation in the system of the universe, and then\r\nhuman nature emerges.\r\n\r\nBut human nature plainly belongs to the last day of the work of\r\ncreation rather than the first, where we are now. In man, to all\r\nappearance, the organism is the mother and nurse of the spirit. And\r\nthough the assimilative action of the mind upon the body becomes\r\nnormally, at least, stronger and stronger as life advances, so long as\r\nthe organ retains all its perfection, yet at first the assimilative\r\naction of the body upon the mind is almost everything. The infant,\r\nthe child, is little else but the victim of sensation--that is, of\r\nassimilations in its mind, effected by the force of external nature,\r\nincluding the organism itself. But as the mind, through the sustained\r\naction towards the focus of the myo-neuro-cerebral system, which is\r\nin the brain, gains quantity or intensity--in one word, energy--it\r\nbecomes more independent and free, and more able to react out of\r\nitself upon the organism in any direction of which it makes choice....\r\n\r\nHitherto, Macvicar has proceeded analytically, or from the one\r\nto the many; now, synthetically, from multiplicity to unity:--he\r\ncontinues:--As to the matter in hand, we may say, shortly, that\r\na world of substances becoming multiple and diffuse, and at last\r\nmerging into ethereal elements, being now given as the product of\r\nthe law of assimilation in reference to the immensity of the Creator,\r\nthe same law, when viewed in reference to the unity of the Creator,\r\nleads us to infer a process of quite a contrary character. It leads us\r\nto expect to find the ethereal elements tending to construct unities\r\nof greater energy than themselves. Then, if all cosmical action is\r\ncyclical, matter, when existing free in the ether, must ultimately\r\ntend to dissolve into pure ether again; for, if the law of creation\r\nis as a cycle, in which, after development and as its fruit, the\r\nlast term gives the first, then has he grounds for his conjecture\r\nthat complication in structure is necessary to the segregation of\r\nnervous matter, and the construction of a \"myo-neuro-cerebral system\";\r\nand that ether and matter, after developing a molecular economy,\r\nas the mother and nurse of a soul or monad of a higher order than\r\nthe merely material element, through or by this organism, complete\r\nthe cycle of the economy of the material nature, and eventually\r\ntouch upon the spiritual world again and contribute to it. Whether\r\nthis inference is correct or not, it presents a noble hypothesis for\r\nconsideration, and one which should command attention at a time when\r\nthe writings of John Worrell Keely, the discoverer of polar energy,\r\nand the inventor of vibratory machinery for the utilization of this\r\nforce in mechanics, are about to be given to the world, supporting as\r\nthey do, some of \"the unwelcome views\" advanced by Macvicar a quarter\r\nof a century ago. Although Macvicar and Keely differ in their theories\r\nof molecular morphology, they agree entirely in calling the cosmical\r\nlaw of sympathetic association or assimilation the watchword and\r\nthe law of creation. This true protoplasm, the ether, which Macvicar\r\npostulated, Keely claims to have proved \"a reality\": making use of\r\nthe ether, which he liberates by vibratory machinery, as the medium\r\nof a motive power, which he calls \"sympathetic negative attraction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF KEELY'S PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\n1885 TO 1887.\r\n\r\n            Too few the helpers on the road,\r\n            Too heavy burdens in the load.\r\n\r\n        When a movement is willed a current is sent forth from\r\n        the brain.\r\n\r\n                                            Sir James Crichton Browne.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 1884, Mr. Keely obtained a standard for progressive\r\nresearch in the success of an experiment, which he had tried many times\r\nbefore, without arriving at the result that his theories had led him\r\nto expect. One of those present, at the time that this test was made,\r\nafterwards wrote to Mr. Keely, to obtain an explanation of the dynamic\r\nforce which had been witnessed, causing a small globe to rotate when\r\ntwo persons had taken hold of the rod together, with a firm grasp;\r\none of whom was standing on a circular sheet of metal, from which\r\npiano wires stretched toward the globe, near enough to touch one of the\r\nplates of glass which insulated the ball. Mr. Keely replied, \"I cannot\r\ndescribe it other than the receptive concussion of the two forces,\r\npositive and negative, coming together, seeking their coincidents and\r\nthus producing rotation by harmonious waves, not streams. You ask if\r\nsound waves had anything to do with the motion of the globe? Nothing;\r\nthe introductory settings are entirely different. The ball ceased\r\nto rotate when I took your left hand in my right hand, while with\r\nour other hands holding the iron rod resting on the metal plate,\r\nbecause the receptive flows became independent of the circular chord\r\nof resonation as set up mechanically. The power of rotation comes on\r\nthe positive; and the power of negation breaks it up.\"...\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this confirmation of his theories, Keely pursued his\r\nresearches with renewed vigour. At this time he wrote, \"I am straining\r\nevery nerve to accomplish certain matters in a given time, working\r\nfrom twelve to fourteen hours daily. Although in my illness I have had\r\nsome peaceful hours in thinking over the fascinating points associated\r\nwith the researches to which I am devoting my life, I have also had\r\nsome very stormy ones in reviewing the many unjust insinuations and\r\ndenouncements that have been heaped upon me by the ignorant and the\r\nbase-hearted. My one desire has been the acquisition of knowledge;\r\nand, no matter how great the impediment thrown in my path, I will work\r\nwithout ceasing to attain my end. After struggling for over seventeen\r\nyears, allowing scientists to examine my machinery in the most thorough\r\nmanner, and to make the most sensitive tests, denunciations have\r\nmultiplied against me. One charge is that I use sodium in my mercury,\r\nin the vacuum test. I have thought that I would never again make any\r\neffort to prove that I am honest; but I am working in a new lead,\r\nand for the satisfaction of the few friends that I have I propose\r\nto show my introductory evolutions, in proof of the negatization\r\nof an etheric substance to produce vacuum. The mercury may be\r\ndelivered to me by an expert: I will operate from an open mercury\r\nbath: using the most perfect mercury gauge obtainable, attached to\r\nthe same sphere that the column is operated from. Professor Rogers,\r\nthe highest authority we have, saw the operation of inducing these\r\netheric vacuums and pronounced the result wonderful. He said that\r\nthe scientific world would go down on its knees, if I produced only\r\none pound of vacuum under the conditions named. I showed from one to\r\nfourteen lbs. during the evolutions.... As soon as I have been able\r\nto combine all the positive and negative forces of etheric vibration\r\nin the triple vibratory sphere-engine that I am now at work upon,\r\nin short, as soon as I have completed a perfect, patentable machine,\r\nthen my labours will cease on the Motor line; and after my patents are\r\ntaken out, I will devote the remainder of my life to Aerial Navigation,\r\nfor I have the only true system to make it an entire success in the\r\nvibratory lift and the vibratory push-process.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, at this stage, Keely had no idea of giving up\r\nthe engine; and was still as confident of ultimate success as in the\r\nbeginning. There is no doubt that, had not the time arrived when the\r\ndirecting power of Providence led him away in quite another direction\r\nfrom the line that he was then working upon, his system for Aerial\r\nNavigation would have been lost to this century. \"The heart of man\r\ndeviseth his way, but the Lord directs his steps.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time Keely met with an accident. Under date March 22nd,\r\nhe wrote, \"It has been impossible for me to write, my right hand\r\nand arm were so severely strained, but I have not been idle. I have\r\nhad time for reflection, and I have been setting up a key to explain\r\nvibratory rotation. I have also a plan for a device to be attached to\r\nthe Liberator as an indicator to show when the neutral centre is free\r\nfrom its intensification while operating. In this way the dangerous\r\ninfluences will be avoided which present themselves on the extension\r\nof the vibratory waves that operate the gun. All the introductory\r\ndetails of the present engine are as perfect as is possible for the\r\nfirst lead. It is in the form of a sphere, about thirty inches in\r\ndiameter and weighs 800 lbs. Yesterday saw the pure, positive action\r\nof my new Liberator. Mr. Collier and his brother George were present,\r\nand witnessed thirty expulsions, made by myself; after which I had\r\nthem produce the vapour, by imitating my manipulations; which they were\r\nunable to do with the old generator. They were very much delighted. To\r\nsay that the last three weeks have been trying ones, is using\r\nvery mild language to express what I have suffered from accidents,\r\ndisappointments, etc., etc. I have been frozen in at my workshop;\r\nand all things seemed to go wrong; but my present successes are as\r\nan anchor, which I thank God for, who, in His bountiful goodness,\r\nhas carried me into a port of safety over tempestuous seas.\" Again,\r\nunder various dates, Keely wrote:--\"Unbounded success has crowned my\r\nnew departure. I am now preparing new features that are necessary\r\nas adjuncts to denote the true condition, as regards safety in my\r\ndifferent vibratory operations.\" \"Without the aid sent me from on high\r\nthere would have been nothing left of the discovery mechanically; nor\r\nwould there now be a single foot-hold on which hope could rest for a\r\ncompletion of the Keely Motor enterprise.\"... \"I had an accident to\r\none of my registers this morning. It burst with a tremendous report,\r\nshaking things up in a lively way, but no other damage was done beyond\r\nthat to the register.\"\r\n\r\n\"The draughts are nearly completed for the compound vibratory engine,\r\nand next week the work will be commenced and pushed forward with all\r\npossible speed. This is the machine for continuous operation. The\r\nLiberator is as perfect as is possible; and, if the outside adjuncts\r\nare in proper sympathy, my struggles will soon be at an end.\"... \"All\r\nthings are verging into a condition of perfection through the aid\r\nthat I have received, but for which the science of vibratory etheric\r\nforce would, as far as my researches are concerned, have been lost\r\nto the world. I feel that the world is waiting for this force; that\r\nthis advance in science is necessary to keep the proper equilibrium\r\nin our age of progress.\"...\r\n\r\n\"There are moments in which I feel that I can measure the very stars,\r\nwhich shine like Edens in planetary space; fit abodes for beings who\r\nhave made it the study of their lives on earth to create peace and\r\nhappiness for all around them. Is nature a mystery? No, God is in\r\nnature. I do not believe in the line, 'God moves in a mysterious way\r\nHis wonders to perform.' In my estimation, He moves in a very plain\r\nand simple way, if we will open our hearts to the understanding of\r\nHis way. To the man who cannot appreciate the workings of nature,\r\nchemically and otherwise, God's ways may appear mysterious; but when\r\nhe comes to know nature's works he will find simplicity itself in\r\nits highest order of expression.\r\n\r\n\"Could I have one wish, as to science, gratified, I would ask to live\r\nlong enough to be able to appreciate even but one etheric variation\r\nin planetary evolution. It might take fifty thousand years to attain\r\nthis knowledge, but what is that period of time when compared with\r\nthe cycles that have passed away since this earth existed? Yes, in one\r\nsense, 'God does move in a mysterious way His wonders to perform.'\"...\r\n\r\n\"The whirlpool of science has indeed engulphed me in its fascinating\r\nvortex.\"...\r\n\r\n\"May 20th.--Yesterday was a day of trials and disappointments. It\r\nseemed as if nothing would work right. After labouring six hours to\r\nset my safety process, the first operation of the Liberator tore\r\nthe caps all to pieces. I replaced them by a set of duplicates,\r\nand set the Liberator down to the low octaves, when everything\r\nworked to a charm. Night was approaching, and I left the workshop\r\nto get something to eat, returning about eight o'clock to re-conduct\r\nexperiments, in order to discover if possible the cause of the sudden\r\nand most unexpected intensification. I followed up with great care\r\nthe progressive lines until I reached the tenth octave, and then\r\nliberated a score of times, yet no variation on liberator. Next, I\r\nmade an attachment to my safety arrangement, and also to my strongest\r\nresonator, to experiment on vibratory rotation with my shell; when,\r\nwithin two minutes, it attained a frightful velocity: then I suddenly\r\nretracted to the negative, bringing the velocity down from about 1500\r\nper minute to 150. The operation was magnificent, lasting sixty-four\r\nminutes, when a second intensification took place, demolishing two\r\nsafety-shells and one vibratory indicator. I was perfectly dumbfounded,\r\nand unable to account for such a phenomenon. It was then near midnight,\r\nbut I had made up my mind not to discontinue until I had solved the\r\nmystery. After an hour's reflection, I set up a new position on the\r\nresonating wave plates in the forty resonating circuit on the base of\r\nliberator; and got a result which for purity of uniformity surpassed\r\nall experiments that I have ever made. I believe I have now struck\r\nthe root of this difficulty, and that I shall be able to master it;\r\nand obtain continuity of action with perfect rotation.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 1st, 1885.--I am in a perfect sea of mental and physical strain,\r\nintensified in anticipation of the near approach of final and complete\r\nsuccess, and bombarded from all points of the compass by demands and\r\ninquiries; yet, in my researches, months pass as minutes. The immense\r\nmental and physical strain of the past few weeks, the struggles and\r\ndisappointments have almost broken me up. Until the reaction took\r\nplace, which followed my success, I could never have conceived the\r\npossibility of my becoming so reduced in strength as I am now. My\r\nlabours in the future will be of a much milder character; but, before\r\nI again commence them, I must have a few days more of recuperation. I\r\nwas so absorbed in my researches that I forgot my duty to myself,\r\nas regards the requirements of health, and I am now paying the\r\npenalty. It has been misery to me to have absorbed so much more time\r\nand capital than I anticipated; and without the heaven-sent aid which\r\nI have received the world would have lost sight of me for ever.\"...\r\n\r\n\"In view of the unjust comments in certain journals, I intend to\r\nwithdraw entirely from all contact with newspaper men, to give no\r\nmore exhibitions after the one which closes the series, and to devote\r\nall my time and energies to bringing my models into a patentable\r\ncondition. It is said that the New York reporters intended to denounce\r\nme before witnessing my last experiments. Certainly utter ignorance\r\nof my philosophy was displayed in their articles, but they were\r\nlike the viper biting on the file, and only hurt themselves: for\r\nmen who possess but a moderate degree of scientific knowledge have\r\ndenounced them, in turn, as the most ignorant men they had ever come\r\nin contact with. They stated that I started with a power estimated\r\nat over one million pounds pressure to the square inch on the head\r\nof my liberator, a sheer absurdity. The rock I am standing on can\r\nno more be moved by a whirlwind of such attacks than the atmospheric\r\ndisturbance of equilibrium emanating from a butterfly's wing in motion\r\ncould blow down the rock of Gibraltar. I enclose a newspaper cutting:\r\nit was written by an engineer who has interested himself sufficiently\r\nin my work to be able to thoroughly understand my position.\"...\r\n\r\n\"July 15th.--My researches teach me that electricity is but a\r\ncertain condensed form of atomic vibration, a form showing only the\r\nintroductory features which precede the etheric vibratory condition. It\r\nis a modulated force so conditioned, in its more modest flows, as to\r\nbe susceptible of benefit to all organisms. Though destructive to a\r\ngreat degree in its explosive positions, it is the medium by which the\r\nwhole system of organic nature is permeated beneficially; transfusing\r\ncertain forms of inert matter with life-giving principles. It is to\r\na certain degree an effluence of divinity; but only as the branch is\r\nto the tree. We have to go far beyond this condition to reach the\r\npure etheric one, or the body of the tree. The Vibratory Etheric\r\ntree has many branches, and electricity is but one of them. Though\r\nit is a medium by which the operations of vital forces are performed,\r\nit cannot in my opinion be considered the soul of matter.\"...\r\n\r\n\"My safety arrangements (governors and indicators) for liberating are\r\nnot working well; but I am labouring to attain perfection on these\r\ndevices, and I hope soon to have them all right.\"...\r\n\r\n\"I have extraordinary powers, it is true, and I must use them to\r\nthe best advantage; for I know they are the gift of the Almighty,\r\nwho will, I feel sure, carry me to the end of the work which He has\r\ngiven me to accomplish.\"...\r\n\r\n\"I am positive that this year will terminate my struggles. My work is\r\nall progressing satisfactorily, and I am pushing everything forward\r\nas rapidly as possible.\"...\r\n\r\nAugust 5th.--Mr. Keely wrote to one of his friends,--\"I have met\r\nwith an accident to the Liberator. I was experimenting on the third\r\norder of intensification, when the rotation on the circuit was thrown\r\ndown in the compound resonating chamber, which, by the instantaneous\r\nmultiplication of the volume induced thereby, caused an explosion\r\nbursting the metal casing which enclosed the forty resonators,\r\ncompletely dismantling the Liberator. The shock took my senses from\r\nme for a few moments, but I was not even scratched this time. A part\r\nof the wall was torn away, and resonators and vibrators were thrown\r\nall over the room. The neighbourhood was quite lively for a time,\r\nbut I quieted all fears by telling the frightened ones that I was\r\nonly experimenting. I allowed everything to remain until Dr. Woods\r\nand Mr. Collier had seen the effect of the explosion.\"\r\n\r\nThe orders of intensification for accelerating dissociation\r\nwould not be understood by any explanations that could be made, if\r\nunaccompanied by the demonstrations witnessed by the late Professor\r\nLeidy, Dr. Brinton, and others.\r\n\r\nWhen the ether flows from a tube, its negative centre represents\r\nmolecular sub-division, carrying interstitially (or between its\r\nmolecules) the lowest order of liberated ozone. This is the first\r\norder of ozone and is wonderfully refreshing and vitalizing to those\r\nwho breathe it. The second order, or atomic separation, releases a much\r\nhigher grade of ozone; in fact, too pure for inhalation, as it produces\r\ninsensibility. The third order, or etheric, is the one that has been\r\n(though attended with much danger to the operator) utilized by Keely\r\nin his carbon register to produce the circuit of high vibration that\r\nbreaks up the molecular magnetism which is recognized as cohesion.\r\n\r\nThe acceleration of these orders is governed by the introductory\r\nimpulse on a certain combination of vibratory chords, arranged for\r\nthis purpose in the instrument, with which Keely dissociates the\r\nelements of water; and which he calls a liberator.\r\n\r\nIn molecular dissociation one fork of 620 is used, setting the chords\r\non the first octave.\r\n\r\nIn atomic separation, two forks: one of 620 and one of 630 per second;\r\nsetting the chords on the second octave.\r\n\r\nIn the etheric three forks: one of 620, one of 630, and one of 12,000,\r\nsetting the chords on the third octave.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeely's Three Systems.\r\n\r\nMy first system is the one which requires introductory mediums\r\nof differential gravities, air and water, to induce disturbance\r\nof equilibrium on the liberation of vapour, which only reached\r\nthe inter-atomic position and was held there by the submersion of\r\nthe molecular and atomic leads in the 'generator' I then used. It\r\nwas impossible with these mediums to go beyond the atomic with this\r\ninstrument; and I could not dispense with the water until my liberator\r\nwas invented, nor reach the maximum of the full line of vibration. My\r\nfirst system embraces liberator engine and gun.\r\n\r\n\"My second system of dissociation I consider complete, as far as the\r\nliberation of the ether is concerned, but not sufficiently complete,\r\nas yet, in its devices for indicating and governing the vibratory\r\netheric circuit, to make it a safe medium.\r\n\r\n\"My third system embraces aerial and sub-marine navigation. The\r\nexperimental sphere intended to test the combination of the positive\r\nand negative rotation is nearly completed.\r\n\r\n... \"I have done everything that I could do to demonstrate the\r\nintegrity of my inventions, and I will never again allow my devices\r\nto be submitted to examinations; not that I am afraid they will be\r\nstolen, but I do not wish to have the construction of my improved\r\nmechanical devices known until my patents are taken out. Nor will I\r\never again make a statement, specifying the time when certain work\r\nwill be finished. If I thought to-morrow would end all my struggles\r\non this system, I would not say so. I have been a great sufferer from\r\nmy inability to keep my promises, fully believing in my power to keep\r\nthem, and now I must and will prove that all is right before I promise.\r\n\r\n... \"The work on the vibratory engine is progressing rapidly. I spend\r\nan hour or two every day at the shop where my work is being done,\r\nexamining every part of it critically as it is being put together. The\r\nsafety arrangements which I am having attached to my liberator\r\nwill greatly improve it. Its operation will now be conducted with\r\na gum bulb instead of a violin bow, the pressure of which gives the\r\nintroductory chord of impulse that vitalizes the whole machine. The\r\nchords will all be set in progressive sympathy from the first octave\r\nto the fortieth....\r\n\r\n\"I have been writing out some of my theories as to sound and\r\nodour. These two subjects have intensified me considerably of late,\r\non account of the peculiar position they occupy in their lines of\r\nsub-division; as also the peculiar laws that govern them in their\r\ndissemination. I see the time approaching when I will be able to write\r\nup my system of the true philosophy of nature's grandest force, and\r\nhave at my control the proper apparatus to analyze and demonstrate\r\nall the progressive links of transmittive sympathy from the crude\r\nmolecular to the high etheric.\"...\r\n\r\n\"December 17th, 1885.--The setting up of the circles for computing\r\nthe different lines of etheric chords, in setting the vibratory\r\nconditions for continuity, requires close study. I feel convinced that\r\na perfect solution of my difficulties will follow when this part of\r\nthe work has been completed; and that, before many weeks have passed, a\r\nrevelation will be unfolded that will startle the world; a revelation,\r\nso simple in its character, that the physicists will stand aghast,\r\nand perhaps feel humiliated by the nature of their efforts in the past\r\nto solve certain problems.... I find my chief trouble in chording up\r\nthe masses of the different parts composing the negative centres. The\r\nnegative centre is included in the one-third volume of shell or sphere,\r\nstarting from the neutral axis or point of suspension. This point of\r\nsuspension only becomes perfect when the rotation is established on the\r\nsphere. One hundred revolutions per minute is all the velocity required\r\nto neutralize the gravity of the central third with the velocity\r\nof the vibratory circuit at one hundred thousand per second. Taking\r\nall matters into consideration associated with the mechanical part\r\nof the enterprise, the month of January ought to find all completed,\r\nready for sympathetic graduation. But I fear to be too sanguine when\r\nI remember the loss of time and the interferences from exhibitions\r\nto which I have been subjected in the past. I feel more and more the\r\ngreat importance of devoting all my energies to the great task that\r\nDivine Power has ordained me to perform.\"...\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1885, everything seemed to promise full\r\nand complete success during the coming year. Mr. Charles Collier,\r\nthe patent lawyer, shared Keely's confidence in the near completion\r\nof his \"struggles.\" The stock-holders were enthusiastic, and the\r\nstockbrokers were on the qui vive, anticipating a great rise in the\r\nshares of The Keely Motor Company. Mr. Collier had written in August\r\nto Major Ricarde-Seaver [1]: \"The Bank of England is not more solid\r\nthan is our enterprise. My belief is that the present year will see\r\nus through, patents and all.\"\r\n\r\nThe journals had ceased to ridicule, and some of them were giving\r\nserious attention to the possibilities lying hidden in the discovery of\r\nan unknown force. In 1886, Mr. William Walsh, editor of \"Lippincott's\r\nMagazine,\" accepted a paper on the subject, publishing it in the\r\nSeptember number. It was entitled Keely's Etheric Force.\r\n\r\nThis was the first article accepted by any Philadelphia editor, setting\r\nforth Keely's claims on the public for the patience and protection\r\nwhich the discoverer of a force in nature needs, while researching the\r\nunknown laws that govern its operation. Up to this time Keely had been\r\nheld responsible for the errors made in the premature organization\r\nof a Keely Motor Company, and the selling of stock before there was\r\nanything to give in return for the money paid in by investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSYMPATHETIC VIBRATORY FORCE, 1887.\r\n\r\n        The teleological view was opposed to the mechanical, which\r\n        regarded the universe as a collocation of mere facts without\r\n        any further significance. The mechanical view looked backward\r\n        to the antecedents of a phenomenon, and explained things\r\n        by reducing them to their lowest terms; the teleological\r\n        or philosophical view looked forward to the end or purpose\r\n        which was being realized, which was the reason of the whole\r\n        development, and in the deepest sense its cause. Mechanical\r\n        explanation was an infinite progress, which could ultimately\r\n        explain nothing; in the last resort, causæ efficientes pendent\r\n        a finalibus. In defining the nature of the end which it thus\r\n        asserted, philosophy had to wage unsparing battle against\r\n        the naturalistic tendencies of our time.--(From a Review of\r\n        Professor Seth's address delivered in Glasgow in 1891.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1887, a series of articles appeared in The British Mercantile\r\nGazette, then edited by Mr. Arthur Goddard. The June number devoted\r\nmore than eight columns to the progress and present position of the\r\ndiscoverer of Etheric Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the British Mercantile Gazette.\r\n\r\nSir,--Dr. Ziermann, a German writer, has said that a great deal of\r\nsound sense and moral courage are required to introduce ideas which\r\nwill only be recognised as truth after the lapse of time. He adds,\r\n\"Nay, even to recognize their truth will require more understanding\r\nthan falls to the share of most men.\" The day will come, I think,\r\nwhen your action in giving the pages of your journal to quotations\r\nfrom Mr. Keely's papers on Etheric Physics and Etheric Philosophy,\r\nwill make known your claim to this 'understanding.' In the meantime,\r\nyou have, by your appreciation of his labours and your sympathy\r\nin his trials, extended that assistance to the discoverer of this\r\nnewly-known force in Nature which is more powerful than any other\r\nagent in inspiring to renewed efforts; after ridicule and calumny,\r\nlong continued, have done their worst towards depressing the vital\r\ncentres of nerve-force. When Mr. Keely has made known the law of\r\nsympathetic association to the world, the full meaning of the words\r\n\"sympathy,\" \"help,\" \"consolation,\" will be better understood than they\r\nare now. The most important discoveries, the most difficult problems\r\nof research, the most arduous scientific labours have been achieved\r\nby men who have battled with persecution and contempt at every step\r\nof their progress; enduring all, as he has done, with patience; in\r\nthe full assurance that the glorious truths entrusted to him to reveal\r\nwill, in the end, be proclaimed for the advancement of the race. \"The\r\nnobler the soul,\" writes Ouida, \"the more sensitive it is to the blows\r\nof injustice.\" Cicero tells us that praise stimulates great souls\r\ninto greater exertions; and Plutarch said that souls are sensitive\r\nto sympathy, to praise, and to blame, in exact proportions to the\r\nfineness of their fibre. Mr. Keely proves this truth by actual tests,\r\nas will be seen in time, to the satisfaction of all investigators.\r\n\r\nEvery branch of science, every doctrine of extensive application,\r\nhas had its alphabet, its rudiments, its grammar; indeed, at each\r\nfresh step in the path of discovery, the researcher has to work out\r\nby experiments the unknown laws which govern his discovery. Ignorant\r\nhimself, he builds up his knowledge upon a foundation which, uncertain\r\nas it must be at first, becomes as secure as that of Gibraltar rocks\r\nwhen, one by one, he has removed the misshapen stones of error, and\r\nreplaced them with the hewn granite blocks of truth. To attempt to\r\nintroduce scientists, without any previous preparation, to any new\r\nsystem, no matter how solid its foundation, would be like giving\r\na book published in Greek to a man to read who had never before\r\nseen its characters. We do not expect a complicated problem in the\r\nhigher mathematical analysis to be solved by one who is ignorant\r\nof the elementary rules of arithmetic. Just as futile would it be\r\nto expect scientists to comprehend the laws of etheric physics and\r\netheric philosophy at one glance.\r\n\r\n\r\n       'There are some secrets which, who knows not now,\r\n        Must, ere he reach them, climb the heapy Alps\r\n        Of science, and devote long years to toil.'\r\n\r\n\r\nNorman Lockyer, in his 'Chemistry of the Sun,' writes of molecules\r\nthat 'one feels as if dealing with something that is more like a\r\nmental than a physical attribute--a sort of expression of free will\r\non the part of the molecules.' Herein lies one of the secrets of\r\nMr. Keely's so-called 'compound secret.' Again, Mr. Lockyer writes:\r\n'The law which connects radiation with absorption, and at once enables\r\nus to read the riddle set by the sun and stars, is, then, simply\r\nthe law of sympathetic vibration.' This is the very corner-stone of\r\nMr. Keely's philosophy--yes, even of his discovery.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that all great men who have lived, or who now live,\r\nhave been indebted for their knowledge to teachers or to books;\r\nbut all progress depends upon the use made of such knowledge when\r\nacquired. In order to bear fruit, knowledge must be increased by\r\nreflection, and by placing the mind in that attitude which brings into\r\nplay the powers of intuition; or, rather, placing it in the receptive\r\nstate which admits of the in-flowing of what is called inspiration.\r\n\r\nMolecular vibration is Keely's legitimate field of research. In this\r\nfield his discovery was made, many years since; but it is only now,\r\nwithin this year, that he has reached any approach to a solution of\r\nthe stupendous problems which have arisen barring and baffling all\r\nprogress, at times, towards the complete subjugation and control of\r\nthe force that he had discovered. Again and again has he invited the\r\nattention of scientists to his discovery, from the commencement of\r\nhis researches; but the few scientists who condescended to accept his\r\ninvitations were so ignorant of the mysteries which they sought to\r\ninvestigate--of 'the alphabet and rudiments' of etheric physics--that\r\nthey found it easier to accuse him of jugglery and of fraud than to\r\naccount for the phenomena that they witnessed. They addressed their\r\nreport to a public even more ignorant than themselves, if such a thing\r\ncould be possible, with the result of preventing other scientists,\r\nwho would have better understood the experiments, from examining into\r\nKeely's claims, as the discoverer of an unknown force. A system of\r\ndoctrine can be legitimately refuted only upon its own principles,\r\nviz., by disproving its facts, and invalidating the principles\r\ndeduced from them. It is, then, the facts, and not the opinions of\r\nthe ignorant or the prejudiced, which are of chief importance here,\r\nas in all other questions of moment.\r\n\r\nAll those men who have witnessed the production of etheric force\r\nand its application experimentally, during the exhibitions given at\r\nvarious times, have, if capable of understanding such a marvellous\r\ndiscovery as Keely has made, agreed to a man in bearing testimony,\r\nat the time, that no known force could have produced such results\r\nunder the same conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is now three years since Keely invited certain English men of\r\nscience (experimenting in the same field where his explorations\r\ncommenced) to examine his Liberator; which was dismantled for the\r\npurpose, and all its parts assembled for examination before being put\r\ntogether for the production of etheric force, when these men refused\r\nto visit his workshop, and it has been said that a Professor of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania prevented the investigation by his assertion\r\nthat compressed air is the force used by Keely with which to dupe\r\nhis audiences. A schoolboy's knowledge of the change of temperature\r\nalways accompanying the compression of air would prevent such an\r\nassertion from being made by anyone who had witnessed the operation\r\nof the Liberator in the production and storage of etheric force,\r\nduring which there is not the slightest change of temperature. Had\r\nthese English scientists, with their knowledge of acoustics, been\r\npresent on the occasion referred to, no such groundless assertion\r\nwould have possessed any influence with either; and the world of\r\nscience would have sooner known and acknowledged the nature and the\r\nworth of this great discovery.\r\n\r\nRoget says that if we are to reason at all, we can reason only upon the\r\nprinciple that for every effect there must exist a corresponding cause;\r\nor, in other words, that there is an established and invariable order\r\nof sequence among the changes which take place in the universe. The\r\nbar to all further reasoning lies in the fact that there are men\r\nwho, admitting all the phenomena we behold are the effects of certain\r\ncauses, still say that these causes are utterly unknown to us, and that\r\ntheir discovery is wholly beyond the reach of our faculties. Those who\r\nurge this do not seem to be aware that its general application in every\r\nsense would shake the foundation of every kind of knowledge--even that\r\nwhich we regard as built upon the most solid basis. Of causation it\r\nis agreed that we know nothing; all that we do know is that one event\r\nsucceeds another with undeviating constancy; and what do we know of\r\nmagnetism, electricity, galvanism, but such facts as have been elicited\r\nby the labours of experimental enquirers, and the laws which have been\r\ndeduced from their generalization? Would it be considered a sufficient\r\nreason for the absolute rejection of any of these facts--or a whole\r\nclass of facts--that we are still ignorant of the principle upon which\r\nthey depend, and that such knowledge is beyond our reach? Facts are\r\nevery day believed, upon observation, or upon testimony, which we\r\nshould be exceedingly puzzled to account for, if called upon to do\r\nso. Every man who has passed the mere threshold of science ought to\r\nbe aware that it is quite possible to be in possession of a series of\r\nfacts, long before he is capable of giving a rational and satisfactory\r\nexplanation of them; in short, before he is enabled to discover their\r\ncauses. Also that he must classify his facts and construct hypotheses\r\nbefore he can impart his experimental position to others. Many things\r\nwhich were, for a long time, treated as fabulous and incredible\r\nhave been proved, in our age, to be authentic facts, as soon as\r\nthe evidence in support of them was duly subjected to the crucible\r\nof scientific investigation. Take, for example, Professor Dewar's\r\nresearches in the cause, or origin, of meteoric stones. Fortunately\r\nfor his branches of research and experiment, he is possessed of that\r\nphilosophical spirit and energy which enables him to divest himself\r\nof all prejudice, and, in constructing his theories, to welcome the\r\nevidence of truth from whatever quarter it approaches. More than two\r\nthousand years elapsed between the first record of the phenomenon, by\r\nAnaxagoras, and Mr. Howard's observations in 1802, during which time\r\nthe fact was disputed most strenuously by many, while, in our time,\r\nProfessor Dewar's explanations of the same, upon intelligible and\r\nsatisfactory principles, have confirmed the statements made centuries\r\nago. How few the years, in comparison, since Keely's grand discovery\r\nfirst broke upon his own mind, which he has devoted to experiment,\r\nto invention, to the classification of facts, and the building up of\r\nhypotheses, before reaching the goal of his desires. Men will marvel\r\nat the shortness of the period when all that he has accomplished is\r\nmade known. The delays which have occurred in bringing before the\r\nworld the actual discovery of this primal force, from which all the\r\nforces of nature spring, have been in part occasioned by the want\r\nof that sympathy and appreciation which Keely would have received\r\nfrom his fellow-men, had scientists believed him to be honest in his\r\nclaims. He would not then have been left in the merciless hands of\r\n\"a ring,\" which gave or withheld financial aid according as he could\r\nbe \"thumbscrewed,\" into giving exhibitions for speculative ends on\r\nthe part of \"the ring.\" These costly days of delay are now a thing\r\nof the past. Keely's programme of work for the remainder of the year\r\nembraces such exhibitions of his progress as can be given without\r\ninterfering with this programme.\r\n\r\nColeridge says in \"Table Talk,\"--\"I have seen what I am certain I\r\nwould not have believed on your telling; and in all reason, therefore,\r\nI can neither expect nor wish that you should believe on mine.\" It is\r\nof all tasks the most difficult to procure any favourable reception\r\nfor doctrines which are objectionable only because they are deemed\r\nto be incompatible with preconceived notions. It does not answer to\r\ndisturb the calmness of views now held by our most eminent physicists,\r\nwho seem to expect that nature will always accommodate her operations\r\nto their preconceived notions of possibility, and adapt her phenomena\r\nto their arbitrary systems of philosophy. We are all familiar\r\nwith the anecdote of the wise Indian potentate who imagined that\r\nhis informant was imposing upon his credulity when giving him an\r\naccurate description of the steam-engine. Now what would be thought\r\nof that philosopher who, in attempting to communicate an adequate\r\nidea of the operation of the steam-engine, should content himself\r\nwith a mere description of its mechanism--of its wheels and levers,\r\nand cylinders and pistons--keeping entirely out of view the moving\r\npower--the steam; and ridiculing all investigation into the nature,\r\napplication, and phenomena of this power. Yet this is exactly what\r\nmicroscopic observers of the animal economy call \"absurd and useless\r\ninquiry.\" The true springs of our organization are not these muscles,\r\nthese arteries, these nerves, which are described and experimented upon\r\nwith so much care and exactness. They are hidden springs, the action\r\nof which are as miracles to those who have vainly tried to account\r\nfor the motion of the muscles at the command of the will; for the\r\npower of vision, which places the human eye in intimate and immediate\r\nconnection with the soul--dependent as they are upon unknown laws,\r\nassigned them by the great, omniscient and omnipotent Being by whom\r\nthey were originally created, and Who is the one source of all power.\r\n\r\nAlthough in our present ordinary state of existence we are permitted to\r\nsee only \"as through a glass darkly,\" ignorant of many of the powers\r\nand processes of nature, as well as of the causes to which they are\r\nto be ascribed, we are not, therefore, entitled to set limits to\r\nher operations, and to say to her, \"Hitherto shalt thou go, and no\r\nfurther! \"We must not presume, says Glanvill, to assign bounds to the\r\nexercise of the power of the Almighty, nor are these operations and\r\nthat power to be controlled by the arbitrary theories and capricious\r\nfancies of man. We are surrounded by the incredible--the seemingly\r\nmiraculous. Who would not ask for demonstration when told that a\r\ngnat's wing, in its ordinary flight, beats many hundred times in a\r\nsecond? But what is this, when compared to the astonishing truths\r\nwhich modern optical inquiries reveal--such as teach us that the\r\nsensation of violet light affects our eyes 707 millions of millions\r\nof times per second in order to effect that sensation?\r\n\r\nHow strangely must they estimate nature, how highly must they\r\nvalue their own conceits, who deny the possibility of any cause\r\nof any effect, merely because it is incomprehensible. In fact,\r\nwhat do men comprehend? What do they know of causes? When Newton\r\nsaid that gravitation held the world together, he assigned no reason\r\nwhy the heavenly bodies do not fly off from each other into infinite\r\nspace. The discoverer of etheric force is able to give the reasons for,\r\nand the explanations of, the laws involved in all that he asserts; or,\r\nrather, all that he propounds; for, with the true humility of wisdom,\r\nhe asserts nothing. Newton at first thought that he had discovered in\r\nelectricity the ether which he asserted pervades all nature, until,\r\nby repeated experiments, he became convinced of the insufficiency\r\nof that principle to explain the phenomena. Other philosophers have\r\nspeculated upon magnetism in the same way, and upon the similarity\r\nbetween magnetism and electricity. Mr. Keely's experiments show that\r\nthe two are, in part, antagonistic, and that both are but modifications\r\nof the one force in nature. There have been some physiologists who have\r\nmaintained that the nerves are merely the conductors of some fluid\r\nfrom the brain and spinal cord to the different parts of the body,\r\nand that this circulating fluid is capable of an external expansion,\r\nwhich takes place with such energy as to form an atmosphere, or sphere\r\nof activity, similar to that of electrical bodies. Dr. Roget observes\r\nthat the velocity with which the nerves subservient to sensation\r\ntransmit the impressions they receive at one extremity, along their\r\nwhole course, exceeds all measurement, and can be compared only to\r\nthat of electricity passing along a conducting wire. A comparison\r\nwith gravity would have been nearer the truth, though no computation\r\never has been made, or ever can be made, between the flight of gravity\r\nand of electricity, so infinitely swifter is the former.\r\n\r\nBéclard almost completely demonstrated the truth of Roget's hypothesis\r\nconcerning the action of \"the nervous fluid\" by cutting a nerve\r\nof considerable size, adjoining a muscle, which induced paralysis\r\nin this part. Perceiving the contractile action reappear, when he\r\napproached the two ends of the nerve to the distance of three lines,\r\nhe became convinced that an imponderable substance, a fluid of some\r\nkind, traversed the interval of separation, in order to restore the\r\nmuscular action. By another experiment he demonstrated its striking\r\nanalogy to galvanic electricity. The late Professor Keil, of Jena,\r\nalso made some very interesting experiments of the same character, one\r\nof which tends to demonstrate the susceptibility of the nervous system\r\nto the magnetic influence, and the efficacy of the magnet in the cure\r\nof certain infirmities. It was communicated by him to a meeting of\r\nthe Royal Society of London more than fifty years since. If we are\r\njustified, then, in assuming the existence of this nervous fluid,\r\nwrites Colquhoun, in 1836, whether secreted by, or merely conducted\r\nby the nerves, and of its analogy to the other known, active, and\r\nimponderable fluids, and of its capability of external expansion, as\r\nin the case of electricity, it does not appear to be a very violent\r\nor unwarrantable proceeding to extend the hypothesis a little further,\r\nand to infer that it is also capable of being transmitted or directed\r\noutwards, either involuntarily or by the volition of one individual,\r\nwith such energy as to produce certain real and perceptible effects\r\nupon the organism of another, in a manner analogous to what is known\r\nto occur in the case of the torpedo the gymnotus-electricus, etc.\r\n\r\nShould it be that Mr. Keely's compound secret includes any explanation\r\nof this operation of will-force, showing that it may be cultivated,\r\nin common with the other powers which God has given us, we shall then\r\nrecover some of the knowledge lost out of the world, or retained only\r\nin gipsy tribes and among Indian adepts.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the law of sympathetic association, which Mr. Keely\r\ndemonstrates as the governing medium of the universe, find\r\nillustrations in inanimate nature. What else is the influence which\r\none string of a lute has upon a string of another lute when a stroke\r\nupon it causes a proportionable motion and sound in the sympathizing\r\nconsort, which is distant from it, and not perceptibly touched? It\r\nhas been found that, in a watchmaker's shop, the timepieces,\r\nor clocks, connected with the same wall or shelf, have such a\r\nsympathetic effect in keeping time, that they stop those which beat\r\nin irregular time; and, if any are at rest, set those going which\r\nbeat accurately. Norman Lockyer deals with the law of sympathetic\r\nassociation as follows:--\"While in the giving out of light we are\r\ndealing with molecular vibration taking place so energetically as\r\nto give rise to luminous radiation, absorption phenomena afford no\r\nevidence of this motion of the molecules when their vibrations are\r\nfar less violent.\"... \"The molecules are so apt to vibrate each in\r\nits own period that they will take up vibrations from light which\r\nis passing among them, provided always that the light thus passing\r\namong them contains the proper vibrations.\"... \"Let us try to get a\r\nmental image of what goes on. There is an experiment in the world of\r\nsound which will help us.\"... \"Take two large tuning-forks, mounted on\r\nsounding-boxes, and tuned to exact unison. One of the forks is set in\r\nactive vibration by means of a fiddle-bow, and then brought near to\r\nthe other one, the open mouths presented to each other. After a few\r\nmoments, if the fork originally sounded is damped to stop its sound,\r\nit will be found that the other fork has taken up the vibration,\r\nand is sounding distinctly. If the two forks are not in unison,\r\nno amount of bowing of the one will have the slightest effect in\r\nproducing sound from the other.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough physicists know that this extraordinary influence exists\r\nbetween inanimate objects as a class, they look upon the human organism\r\nas little more than a machine, taking small interest in researches\r\nwhich evince the dominion of mind over matter. Keely's experimental\r\nresearch in this province has shown him that it is neither the electric\r\nnor the magnetic flow, but the etheric, which sends its current along\r\nour nerves; that the electric or the magnetic bears an infinitely small\r\nratio to that of an etheric flow, both as to velocity and tenuity; that\r\ntrue coincidents can exist between any mediums--cartilage to steel,\r\nsteel to wood, wood to stone, and stone to cartilage; that the same\r\ninfluence (sympathetic association) which governs all the solids holds\r\nthe same governing influence over all liquids; and again, from liquid\r\nto solid, embracing the three kingdoms, animal, vegetable and mineral;\r\nthat the action of mind over matter thoroughly substantiates these\r\nincontrovertible laws of sympathetic etheric influence; that the only\r\ntrue medium which exists in nature is the sympathetic flow emanating\r\nfrom the normal human brain, governing correctly the graduating and\r\nsetting-up of the true sympathetic vibratory positions in machinery\r\nnecessary to success; that these flows come in on the order of the\r\nfifth and seventh positions of atomic subdivision, compound ether a\r\nresultant of this subdivision; that, if metallic mediums are brought\r\nunder the influence of this sympathetic flow they become organisms\r\nwhich carry the same influence with them that the human brain does\r\nover living physical positions--that the composition of the metallic\r\nand of the physical are one and the same thing, although the molecular\r\narrangement of the physical may be entirely opposite to the metallic on\r\ntheir aggregations; that the harmonious chords induced by sympathetic\r\npositive vibration permeate the molecules in each, notwithstanding,\r\nand bring about the perfect equation of any differentiation that\r\nmay exist--in one, the same as in the other--and thus they become\r\none and the same medium [2] for sympathetic transmission; that the\r\netheric flow is of a tenuity coincident to the condition governing the\r\nseventh subdivision of matter--a condition of subtlety that readily\r\nand instantaneously permeates all forms of aggregated matter, from\r\nair to solid hammered steel--the velocity of the permeation being the\r\nsame with the one as with the other; that the tenuity of the etheric\r\nflow is so infinitely fine that any magnifying glass, the power of\r\nwhich would enlarge the smallest grain of sand to the size of the\r\nsun, brought to bear upon it, would not make it visible to us; that\r\nlight, traversing at the speed of 200,000 miles per second a distance\r\nrequiring a thousand centuries to reach, would be traversed by the\r\netheric flow in an indefinite fragment of a second.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the problems which Mr. Keely has had to solve before\r\nhe could adapt his vibratory machinery to the etheric flow. The true\r\nconditions for transmitting it sympathetically through a differential\r\nwire of platinum and silver have now been attained, after eight\r\nyears of intense study and elaborate experiment. The introductory\r\nindications began to show themselves about two years ago, but the\r\nintermissions on transmission were so frequent and so great as to\r\ndiscourage Mr. Keely from further research on this line. Then came\r\none of those \"inspirations\" which men call \"accident,\" revealing\r\nto him \"the true conditions\" necessary to produce a sympathetic\r\nflow, free of differentiation, proving conclusively the truth\r\nof his theory of the law governing the atomic triplets in their\r\nassociation. Differentiation, by compound negative vibration of their\r\nneutral centres, causes antagonism, and thus the great attractive\r\npower that aggregates them becomes one of dispersion or expansion,\r\naccompanied by immense velocity of rotation, which carries its\r\ninfluence through the whole volume of air, 230 cubic inches contained\r\nin sphere, within its 33 1/3 chord of its circle of coincidence. By\r\nthis wire of platinum and silver the current of force is now passed\r\nto run the vibratory disk, thus altogether upsetting the \"compressed\r\nair\" theory of Professor Barker, Dr. Hall, and others of less note.\r\n\r\n\"In setting the conditions of molecular sympathetic transmission\r\nby wire,\" writes Keely, \"the same law calls for the harmonious\r\nadjustment of the thirds, to produce a non-intermittent flow of\r\nsympathy. Intermission means failure here. That differential molecular\r\nvolume is required, in two different mediums of molecular density,\r\nto destroy differentiation of sympathetic flow, seems at first sight\r\nto controvert the very law established by the great Creator, which\r\nconstitutes harmony--a paradoxical position which has heretofore\r\nmisled physicists who have propounded and set forth most erroneous\r\ndoctrines, because they have accepted the introductory conditions,\r\ndiscarding their sympathetic surroundings. The volume of the neutral\r\ncentre of the earth is of no more magnitude than the one of a molecule:\r\nthe sympathetic condition of one can be reached in the same time as\r\nthe other by its coincident chord.\"\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen what difficulties Keely has encountered in his\r\npersevering efforts to use the etheric flow in vibratory machinery. One\r\nby one he has conquered each, attaining the transmission of the\r\netheric current in the same manner as the electric current, with\r\nthis one notable difference--that, in order to show insulation to the\r\nsceptical, he passes the etheric current through blocks of glass in\r\nrunning his vibratory devices.\r\n\r\nWhen Keely's system is finished, then, and not until then, all that\r\nis involved in his discovery will be made known to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nFive years after this paper on Etheric force was written, Dr. Henry\r\nWood, of Boston, wrote an article, which appeared in The Arena of\r\nOctober, 1891, having the title Healing through Mind. Dr. Wood says:\r\n\"Truth may be considered as a rounded unit. Truths have various and\r\nunequal values, but each has its peculiar place, and if it be missing\r\nor distorted, the loss is not only local but general. Unity is made up\r\nof variety, and therein is completeness. Any honest search after truth\r\nis profitable, for thereby is made manifest the kingdom of the real....\r\n\r\n\"We forget that immaterial forces rule not only the invisible but\r\nthe visible universe. Matter, whether in the vegetable, animal, or\r\nhuman organism, is moulded, shaped, and its quality determined by\r\nunseen forces back of and higher than itself. We rely upon the drug,\r\nbecause we can feel, taste, see, and smell it. We are colour-blind\r\nto invisible potency of a higher order, and practically conclude that\r\nit is non-existent.\"--Healing through Mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nETHERIC VIBRATION. THE KEY FORCE.\r\n\r\n                                Discovery is not invention.--Edison.\r\n\r\n\r\nScience has been compared to a stately and wide-spreading tree,\r\nstretching outward and upward its ever-growing boughs. As yet mankind\r\nhas reached only to its lowermost branches, too often satisfied with\r\nthe dead calyxes which have fallen from it to the ground, after serving\r\ntheir uses for the protection of the vital germs of truth. The seed of\r\nthe next advance in science can only germinate as the dry husk decays,\r\nwithin which its potentiality was secretly developed.\r\n\r\nFor upwards of ten centuries false portions of the philosophy of\r\nAristotle enslaved the minds of civilized Europe, only, at last,\r\nto perish and pass away like withered leaves.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect system of philosophy must always be that which can\r\nreconcile and bring together the greatest number of facts that can\r\ncome within the sphere of the subject. In this consists the sole glory\r\nof Newton, whose discovery rests upon no higher order of proof. In\r\nthe words of Dr. Chalmers, \"Authority scowled upon this discovery,\r\ntaste was disgusted by it, and fashion was ashamed of it. All the\r\nbeauteous speculation of former days was cruelly broken up by this\r\nnew announcement of the better philosophy, and scattered like the\r\nfragments of an aerial vision, over which the past generations of\r\nthe world had been slumbering in profound and pleasing reverie.\"\r\n\r\nThus we see that time is no sure test of a doctrine, nor ages of\r\nignorance any standard by which to measure a system. Facts can have a\r\nvalue only when properly represented and demonstrated by proof. Velpeau\r\nsaid nothing can lie like a fact. Sir Humphry Davy asserted that\r\nno one thing had so much checked the progress of philosophy as the\r\nconfidence of teachers in delivering dogmas as facts, which it would\r\nbe presumptuous to question. This reveals the spirit which made the\r\ncrude physics of Aristotle the natural philosophy of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of vibratory rotation, which is yet to be propounded\r\nto the world, reveals the identity of facts which seem dissimilar,\r\nbinding together into a system the most unconnected and unlike results\r\nof experience, apparently. John Worrell Keely, the discoverer of an\r\nunknown force and the propounder of a pure philosophy, learned at an\r\nearly stage of his researches not to accept dogmas as truths, finding\r\nit safer to trust to that \"inner light\" which has guided him than\r\nto wander after the ignis fatuus of a false system. He has been like\r\na traveller exploring an unknown zone in the shade of night, losing\r\nhis way at times, but ever keeping before him the gleam of breaking\r\nday which dawned upon him at the start. Scientists have kept aloof\r\nfrom him, or, after superficial examinations, have branded him as \"a\r\nmodern Cagliostro,\" \"a wizard,\" \"a magician,\" and \"a fraud.\" Calumnies\r\nhe never stoops to answer, for he knows that when his last problem\r\nis solved to his own satisfaction his discovery and his inventions\r\nwill defend him in trumpet tones around our globe. Buchanan says,\r\n\"Who would expect a society of learned men, the special cultivators\r\nand guardians of science, as they claim to be, to know as much of the\r\nwonderful philosophy now developing as those who have no artificial\r\nreputation to risk in expressing an opinion, no false and inflated\r\nconceptions of dignity and stability to hold them back, and who stand\r\nready to march on from truth to truth as fast and far as experimental\r\ndemonstration can lead them?\"\r\n\r\nJohnson tells us that the first care of the builder of a new system\r\nis to demolish the fabrics that are standing. But the cobwebs of\r\nage cannot be disturbed without rousing the bats, to whom daylight\r\nis death.\r\n\r\nWhen has Nature ever whispered her secrets but for the advancement\r\nof our race on that royal road which leads to the subjugation of the\r\npower she reveals? But not until the inspiration of thought has done\r\nits work in applying the power to mechanics, can the tyrant thus\r\nencountered be transformed into the slave.\r\n\r\nSo was it with steam, so has it been with electricity, and so will it\r\nbe with vibratory force. All experience shows that the steady progress\r\nof the patient study of what are termed Nature's laws does not attract\r\npublic attention until there are some practical results. Professor\r\nTyndall has said that the men who go close to the mouth of Nature and\r\nlisten to her communications leave the discoveries they make for the\r\nbenefit of posterity to be developed by practical men. The invention of\r\nvibratory machinery for the liberation and the operation in mechanics\r\nof sympathetic force is an instance where practical application of the\r\ndiscovery may be made by the discoverer. After years of experiments\r\nwith this force, what does the public know of its nature? Nothing;\r\nfor as yet no practical results have been obtained. Here is a power\r\nsustaining the same relations to electricity that the trunk of a\r\ntree does to its branches,--the discovery of which heralds to the\r\nscientific world possibilities affecting motive industries, such as\r\nshould command the attention of all men; and yet it is known only as\r\na theme for jest and ridicule and reproach! And why is this? Partly\r\nfrom the mismanagement of a prematurely-organized Keely Motor Company,\r\nand partly because men competent to judge for themselves have preferred\r\nto take the opinion of others not competent, instead of investigating\r\neach for himself.\r\n\r\nAttempts to interest scientists in the marvellous mechanism by\r\nwhich etheric force is evolved from the atmosphere have failed,\r\neven as Galileo failed at Padua to persuade the principal professor\r\nof philosophy there to look at the moon and planets through his\r\nglasses. The professor pertinaciously refused, as wrote Galileo to\r\nhis friend Kepler. Mankind hate truth, said Lady Mary Montague: she\r\nshould have said, mankind hate new truths. The most simple and rational\r\nadvances in medical science have been received with scorn and derision,\r\nor with stupid censure. Harvey was nicknamed \"the circulator\" [3]\r\nafter his discovery of the circulation of the blood,--which discovery\r\nwas ridiculed by his colleagues and compeers. The same reception\r\nawaited Jenner's introduction of vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe revelation of new truths is compared to the upheaval of rocks\r\nwhich reveal deeply-hidden strata. Stolid conservatism dislikes and\r\navoids such facts, because they involve new thinking and disturb old\r\ntheories. The leaden weight of scepticism drags down the minds of many,\r\nparalyzing their power of reasoning upon facts which reveal truth, from\r\nanother standpoint than their own, with new simplicity and grandeur\r\nin the divine laws of the universe. Others there are, embracing the\r\nmajority of mankind, according to Hazlitt, who stick to an opinion\r\nthat they have long supported, and that supports them. But whenever\r\na discovery or invention has made its way so well by itself as to\r\nachieve reputation, most people assert that they always believed in\r\nit from the first; and so will it be with Keely's inventions, in time.\r\n\r\nIn our day so rapidly are anticipations realized and sanguine hopes\r\nconverted into existing facts, one wonderful discovery followed\r\nby another, that it is strange to find men possessing any breadth\r\nof intellect rejecting truths from hearsay, instead of examining\r\nall things and holding fast to the truth. The laws of sympathetic\r\nassociation need only to be demonstrated and understood to carry\r\nconviction of their truth with them. They control our world and\r\neverything in it, from matter to spirit. They control all the systems\r\nof worlds in the universe; for they are the laws which Kepler predicted\r\nwould in this century he revealed to man. The divine element is shown\r\nby these laws to be like the sun behind the clouds,--the source of\r\nall light, though itself unseen.\r\n\r\nAlready the existence of this unknown force is as well established as\r\nwas the expansive power of steam in the days when the world looked on\r\nand laughed at Rumsey and Fitch and Fulton while they were constructing\r\ntheir steamboats. Even when they were used for inland navigation,\r\nmen of science declared ocean navigation by steam impracticable, up\r\nto the very hour of its consummation. In like manner with electricity,\r\nscientists declared an ocean telegraph impossible, asserting that the\r\ncurrent strong enough to bear messages would melt the wires. Nothing\r\ncould be more unpopular than railways were at their start. In England,\r\nStephenson's were called \"nuisances,\" and false prophets arose then\r\n(as now with Keely's inventions) to foretell their failure. It was\r\npredicted that they would soon be abandoned, and, if not given up,\r\nthat they would starve the poor, destroy canal interests, crush\r\nthousands in fearful accidents, and cover the land with horror.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that the existence of this force is established, I do\r\nnot mean that it is established by a favourable verdict from public\r\nopinion,--which, as Douglas Jerrold said, is but the average stupidity\r\nof mankind, and which is always steadily and persistently opposed\r\nto great and revolutionary discoveries. Establishment consists\r\nin convincing men competent to judge that the effects produced by\r\netheric force could not be caused by any known force. And it is now\r\nyears since such a verdict was first given, substantiated repeatedly\r\nsince, by the testimony of men as incapable of fraud or collusion as\r\nis the discoverer himself.\r\n\r\nNewton, in discovering the existence of a force which we call gravity,\r\ndid not pursue his investigations sufficiently far to proclaim a power\r\nwhich neutralizes or overcomes gravity, the existence of which Keely\r\ndemonstrates in his vibratory-lift experiments.\r\n\r\nBut it is one thing to discover a force in nature, and quite another\r\nthing to control it. It is one thing to lasso a wild horse, and\r\nquite another thing to subdue the animal, harness it, bridle it,\r\nand get the curb-bit in the mouth.\r\n\r\nKeely has lassoed his wild horse; he has harnessed it and bridled it;\r\nand when he has the bit in its place, this force will take its stand\r\nwith steam and electricity, asking nothing, and giving more than\r\nscience ever before conferred on the human race.\r\n\r\nThe Home Journal of October 20th, 1886, contained a paper which\r\npossesses some interest as having been written at the time Mr. Keely\r\nwas using what he called a \"Liberator,\" which enabled him to dispense\r\nwith the use of water; but he was obliged to return to his former\r\nmethod soon after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEtheric Vibration.\r\n\r\nThe late editor of the New York Home Journal, noticing the preceding\r\npaper, which appeared in Lippincott's Magazine, asks:--\"But is not\r\nthis new force too mighty to be managed by mere earthly instruments,\r\nsuch as iron, copper, or lead? It is the key force, the one that\r\npresided over the creation of these very metals, and can it reasonably\r\nbe expected to be caged and fettered by them? Can the bubble withstand\r\nthe onset of the wave, of which it is a mere drift?\"\r\n\r\nWhen lightning was first drawn from the clouds by Franklin, did it\r\noccur to any man living to predict that electricity (which Keely\r\ndefines as a certain form of atomic vibration) could be stored, to\r\nuse at will as a motive power? If atomic vibration can be made to\r\nserve the purposes of mechanics, why not etheric vibration?\r\n\r\nBut let Keely answer for himself. Some years since he wrote as\r\nfollows:--\"In analyzing theoretically the mechanical standard necessary\r\nfor a solution of the philosophy of 'Etheric Vibration,' and the\r\nsystematic mechanism to produce a rotating circle of etheric force,\r\nI must admit that the phenomenon, as presented to myself, by seeming\r\naccident, after almost a lifetime of study, still partially holds\r\nitself to my understanding as paradoxical. After constructing many\r\nmechanical devices in my vain attempts to come more closely to what I\r\nterm a radiaphonic vibratory position, with microphonic adjustments,\r\nI have only been able to reach a few true and standard positions,\r\nwhich I can satisfactorily analyze. There is but one principle\r\nunderlying all, and this principle is the key to the problem.\"\r\n\r\nKeely continues with an explanation of the mechanism of his generator,\r\nwhich he invented and constructed for the multiplication of vibrations,\r\nunder the disturbance of equilibrium by mediums of different specific\r\ngravities--air as one, water as the other. He has since abandoned\r\nthe generator for a vibratory machine which he calls a \"liberator,\"\r\nin which no water is used to develop the force: the disturbance of\r\nthe equilibrium being effected by a medium thoroughly vibratory in\r\nits character. The vapour which Keely produces from this liberator is\r\nperfectly free from all humidity, thus giving it a tenuity which he\r\nhad never been able to reach before, and of a character most desirable\r\nfor the perfect and high lines of action. In the various improvements\r\nwhich Keely has made in his mechanism, feeling his way in the dark as\r\nit were, he sometimes speaks of having \"stupidly stumbled over them,\"\r\nof \"seeming accident,\" or \"seeming chance,\" where another would call\r\nit \"inspiration.\" \"Providence sends chance, and man moulds it to\r\nhis own design.\" The improvement upon the generator was conceived by\r\nKeely during his desperate struggles to effect a simultaneous action\r\nbetween the molecular and atomic leads--an action that was absolutely\r\nessential for the full line of continuation. This shorter and simpler\r\nway of reaching his desired end was suggested, in part, to him by a\r\nquotation from some one of our scientific writings, made in a letter\r\nthat he received. I am not sure about this quotation, but I think it\r\nwas: \"Nature works with dual force, but at rest she is a unit.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the image of God made He man,\" and in the image of man Keely\r\nhas constructed his liberator. Not literally, but, as his vibrophone\r\n(for collecting the waves of sound and making each wave distinct from\r\nthe other in tone when the \"wave-plate\" is struck after the sound\r\nhas died away) is constructed after the human ear, so his liberator\r\ncorresponds in its parts to the human head.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the question asked in the Home Journal. \"Can this\r\nsubtle force reasonably be expected to be caged and fettered by mere\r\nearthly instruments? \"This is the answer, as given by Keely himself:\r\n\"You ask my opinion regarding my ultimate success in the practical\r\nuse of etheric force. My faith is unbounded by doubts. The successful\r\nresult is as positive as the revolutions of our globe, and comes\r\nunder the great law which governs all nature's highest and grandest\r\nand most sensitive operations.\"\r\n\r\nSince Keely wrote the above lines he has had time to get discouraged,\r\nif he could know discouragement; but he has conquered too many of\r\nthe stupendous problems, which barricaded his way in the past, not\r\nto feel equally sanguine now of eventual success in his last problem,\r\nviz. the attaining of continuity of action, which at the present time\r\nseems all but within his grasp.\r\n\r\nSome of his views may prove of interest at a time when his achievements\r\nare beginning to be a little better understood. Gravity he defines as\r\ntransmittive inter-etheric force under immense etheric vibration. He\r\ncontinues:--The action of the mind itself is a vibratory etheric\r\nevolution, controlling the physical, its negative power being\r\ndepreciatory in its effects, and its positive influence elevating.\r\n\r\nThe idea of getting a power as tenuous as this under such control as to\r\nmake it useful in mechanics is scouted by all physicists. And no wonder\r\nthat it is so. But when the character of the velocity of etheric force,\r\neven in a molecule, is understood, the mind that comprehends it must\r\nsuccumb to its philosophy. To move suddenly a square inch of air, at\r\nthe velocity of this vibratory circuit, on full line of graduation,\r\nand at a vibration only of 2,750,000 per second, would require a\r\nforce at least of twenty-five times that of gunpowder. Taking the\r\nexpansive force of gunpowder at 21,000 lbs. per square inch, it\r\nwould be 525,000 lbs. per square inch. This is incomprehensible. The\r\nexplosion of nitroglycerine, which has two and a half times less\r\nvibrations per second, when placed on the surface of a solid rock,\r\nwill tear up the rock before disturbing the equilibrium of the air\r\nabove it. The disturbance takes place after the explosion. To induce\r\nan action on a weight of only twenty grains, the weight of a small\r\nbird-shot, with a range of motion of but one inch, giving it an\r\naction of one million per second, would require the actual force of\r\ntwo and a half tons per second; or, in other words, ten-horse power\r\nper minute. Etheric vibration would move tons at the same velocity\r\nwhen submitted to the vibratory circuit. Thus, the finer the substance\r\nthe greater the power and the velocity under such vibration.\r\n\r\nThe vapour from the liberator, registered at 20,000 pounds per square\r\ninch, has a range of atomic motion of 1333 1/3 the diameter of the\r\natmospheric molecule, with constant rotary vibratory action. At\r\n10,000 pounds, 666 2/3; at 5000, 333 1/3; at 2500, 166 2/3; at 1250,\r\n83 1/3; at 625, 41 2/3. The higher the range of atomic motion the\r\ngreater is its tenuity, and the range is according to the registered\r\npressure. This rule cannot be applied to any other vapour or gas\r\nat present known to scientists. The very evolution on the negative\r\nshows a vacuum of a much higher order than was ever produced before,\r\nthus confounding, to perfect blindness, all theories that have been\r\nbrought to bear upon the situation, in its analysis. The highest\r\nvacuum known is 17 999999-1000000 pounds, or not quite 30 inches; but\r\nby this process etheric vacuums have been repeatedly produced of 50\r\nto 57 inches; ranging down to 30 inches, or 15 pounds. All operations\r\nof nature have for their sensitizing centres of introductory action,\r\ntriple vacuum evolutions. These evolutions are centred in what I call\r\natomic triple revolutions, highly radiaphonic in their character,\r\nand thoroughly independent of all outside forces in their spheres of\r\naction. In fact, no conceivable power, however great, can break up\r\ntheir independent centres. So infinitely minute are they in their\r\nposition that, within a circle that would enclose the smallest\r\ngrain of sand, hundreds of billions of them perform, with infinite\r\nmathematical precision, their continuous vibratory revolution of\r\ninconceivable velocity.\r\n\r\nThese triple centres are the very foundation of the universe, and the\r\ngreat Creator has, in His majestic designs, fixed them indissolubly in\r\ntheir position. Mathematically considered, the respective and relative\r\nmotion of these atomic triplets, gravitating to and revolving around\r\neach other, is about one and one-third of their circumference. The\r\nproblem of this action, when reduced to a mathematical analysis\r\n(presupposing taking it as the quadrature of the circle) would baffle\r\nthe highest order of mathematical science known to bring it to a\r\nnumerical equation.\r\n\r\nThe requirement of every demonstration is that it shall give sufficient\r\nproof of the truth it asserts. Any demonstration which does less than\r\nthis cannot be relied upon, and no demonstration ever made has done\r\nmore than this. We ought to know that the possibilities of success are\r\nin proportion as the means applied are adequate or inadequate for the\r\npurpose; and, as different principles exist in various forms of matter,\r\nit is quite impossible to demonstrate every truth by the same means\r\nor the same principles. I look upon it as the prejudice of ignorance\r\nwhich exacts that every demonstration shall be given by a prescribed\r\nrule of science, as if the science of the present were thoroughly\r\nconversant with every principle that exists in nature. The majority of\r\nphysicists exact this, though some of them know that these means are\r\nentirely inadequate. Every revolving body is impressed by nature with\r\ncertain laws making it susceptible of the operation of force which,\r\nbeing applied, impels motion. These laws may all be expressed under\r\nthe general term, \"Forces,\" which, though various in their nature,\r\npossess an equalizing power; controlling each other (as in the case\r\nof the atomic triplets) in such a way that neither can predominate\r\nbeyond a certain limit. Consequently, these bodies can never approach\r\nnearer each other than a fixed point: nor recede from each other beyond\r\nanother certain point. Hence, these forces are, at some mean point,\r\nmade perfectly equal, and therefore may be considered as but one force;\r\ntherefore as but one element. It matters not that other and disturbing\r\nforces exist outside or inside the space these bodies revolve in,\r\nbecause if this force must be considered as acting uniformly--applying\r\nitself to each of these bodies in a way to produce a perfect equation\r\non all, it is as if this outside force were non-existing.\r\n\r\nThe true study of the Deity by man being in the observation of His\r\nmarvellous works, the discovery of a fundamental, creative law of\r\nas wide and comprehensive grasp as would make this etheric vapour\r\na tangible link between God and man would enable us to realize,\r\nin a measure, the actual existing working qualities of God Himself\r\n(speaking most reverentially) as he would those of a fellow-man. Such\r\na link would constitute a base or superstructure of recognition,\r\npraise, worship and imitation, such as seems to underlie the whole\r\nBiblical structure as a foundation.--Keely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Macvicar, in his theories of the bearing of the cosmical law\r\nof assimilation on molecular action, says: \"During this retreat of\r\nmatter into ether in single material elements or units of weight,\r\nthe molecules and masses from which such vaporization into the common\r\nvapour of matter is going on, may be expected to be phosphorescent.\"\r\n\r\nThis surmise Keely has, over and over, demonstrated, as a fact; also\r\nshowing how gravitation operates as a lever: etheric wave motion:\r\nconcentration under vibratory concussion: and negative vacuous tenuity.\r\n\r\nMrs. F. J. Hughes, writing upon \"Tones and Colours,\" advances theories\r\nof her own, which correspond with those demonstrated by Keely. She\r\nwrites, in a private letter: \"I firmly believe that exactly the same\r\nlaws as those which develop sound keep the heavenly bodies in their\r\norder. You can even trace the poles in sound. My great desire is for\r\nsome philosophical mind to take up my views, as entirely gained from\r\nthe Scriptures; and I am certain that they will be found to be the\r\nlaws developing every natural science throughout the universe.\"\r\n\r\nThus men and women in various parts of the world who still hold to\r\ntheir belief in and worship of God, are \"standing on ground which is\r\ntruly scientific, having nothing to fear from the progress of thought,\r\nin so far as it is entitled to the name of scientific--nay, are in\r\na position to lead the way in all that can be justly so called.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF FORCE.\r\n\r\n        Those who occupy themselves with the mysteries of molecular\r\n        vibration bear the victorious wreaths of successful\r\n        discovery, and show that every atom teems with wonders not\r\n        less incomprehensible than those of the vast and bright\r\n        far-off suns.--Reynolds.\r\n\r\n        The famous Keely motor, which has been hovering on the\r\n        horizon of success for a decade, is but an attempt to repeat\r\n        in an engine of metal the play of forces which goes on at the\r\n        inmost focus of life, the human will, or in the cosmic spaces\r\n        occupied only by the ultimate atoms. The engineer with his\r\n        mallet shooting the cannon-ball by means of a few light taps on\r\n        a receiver of depolarized atoms of water is only re-enacting\r\n        the rôle of the will when with subtle blows it sets the nerve\r\n        aura in vibration, and this goes on multiplying in force and\r\n        sweep of muscle until the ball is thrown from the hand with\r\n        a power proportionate to the one-man machinery. The inventor\r\n        Keely seeks a more effective machinery; a combination of\r\n        thousands of will-forces in a single arm, as it were. But he\r\n        keeps the same vibrating principle, and the power in both cases\r\n        is psychical. That is, in its last analysis.--George Perry.\r\n\r\n        One eternal and immutable law embraces all things and all\r\n        times.--Cicero.\r\n\r\n        When the truth is made known, it will unwarp the complications\r\n        of man's manufacture; and show everything in nature to be\r\n        very simple.--David Sinclair, author of A New Creed.--Digby,\r\n        Long & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gradual change seems to be taking place in the minds of the\r\nwell-informed in reference to the discoverer of, and experimenter\r\nwith, etheric force--John Worrell Keely--which will in time remove\r\nthe burden of accusations from him to those who are responsible for\r\nthe load which he has had to carry.\r\n\r\nThose who know the most of Mr. Keely's philosophy, and of his\r\ninventions to apply this new force to mechanics, are the most sanguine\r\nas to his ultimate success. They say he is great enough in soul,\r\nwise enough in mind, and sublime enough in courage to overcome all\r\ndifficulties, and to stand at last before the world as the greatest\r\ndiscoverer and inventor in the world:--that the hour demanded his\r\ncoming--that he was not born for his great work before his appointed\r\ntime. They predict that he will, with the hammer of science, demolish\r\nthe idols of science; that the demonstration of the truth of his system\r\nwill humble the pride of those scientists who are materialists, by\r\nrevealing some of the mysteries which lie behind the world of matter;\r\nproving that physical disintegration affects only the mode, and not\r\nthe existence, of individual consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of vibratory etheric force, even though never utilized\r\nin mechanics, brings us upon the bridge which divides physical science\r\nfrom spiritual science, and opens up domains the grandeur and glory of\r\nwhich eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, nor hath it entered into\r\nthe mind of man to conceive. The few who understand the nature and\r\nthe extent of Keely's vast researches say that he is about to give\r\na new philosophy to the world, which will upset all other systems;\r\nthey say that he knows what force is; and that he seeks to know\r\nwhat impels and fixes the neutral centre, which attracts to itself\r\ncountless correlations of matter, until it becomes a world; that he\r\nis approaching the origin of life, of memory, and of death; and more,\r\nthat he knows how ignorant he still is: possessing the humility of a\r\nlittle child who knows nothing of science. Such a philosopher deserves\r\nthe appreciation and the encouragement of all who hold Truth as the\r\none thing most worth living for--and dying for, if need be.\r\n\r\nWhat is etheric force? the inquirer asks. It is the soul of nature. It\r\nis the primal force from which all the forces of nature spring.\r\n\r\nFichte writes: \"The will is the living principle of the world of\r\nspirit, as motion is of the world of sense. I stand between two\r\nopposite worlds; the one visible, in which the act alone avails; the\r\nother invisible and incomprehensible, acted on only by the will. I\r\nam an effective force in both these worlds.\"\r\n\r\nNewton said that this subtle ether penetrates through all, even the\r\nhardest bodies, and is concealed in their substance. Through the\r\nstrength and activity of this spirit, bodies attract each other, and\r\nadhere together when brought into contact. In it, and by it, distance\r\nis annihilated, and all objects touch each other. Through this \"life\r\nspirit\" light also flows, and is refracted and reflected, and warms\r\nbodies. Through it we are connected in sympathy with all other souls,\r\nand all the objects of nature, even to all the heavenly bodies. The\r\nword ether is from \"aithô,\" to light up or kindle. According\r\nto Pythagoras and all the oldest philosophers, it was viewed as a\r\ndivine luminous principle or substance, which permeates all things,\r\nand, at the same time, contains all things. They called it the astral\r\nlight. The Germans call it the \"Weltgeist,\" the breath of the Father,\r\nthe Holy Ghost, the life-principle.\r\n\r\nThe sheet-anchor of Keely's philosophy is, in the words of Hooker,\r\none power, ever present, ever ruling, neglecting not the least, not\r\nquailing before the greatest: the lowest not excluded from its care,\r\nnor the highest exempted from its dominion. A power that presents\r\nitself to us as a force: the one force in nature, thrilling to\r\nits deepest heart, and flowing forth responsive to every call. A\r\npower which does all things, and assumes all forms; which has been\r\ncalled electricity in the storm, heat in the fire, magnetism in\r\nthe iron bar, light in the taper, but ever one grand reality, one\r\nall-embracing law. Cosmical law at the fountain-head, suggesting\r\nthat, as the Creator Himself is only one in substance, so also,\r\nprimarily, will the creation be, to which He awards existence. The\r\nextreme simplicity of this deduction, made as it is in the face\r\nof all the variety and multiplicity of individualized objects that\r\nthere are in the universe, seems to involve many difficulties. But,\r\nas Macvicar writes, different beings, whether classes or individuals,\r\nare known to us, not by any difference in their substance, but only\r\nby differences in their attributes. And since being or substance,\r\nand power or potentiality, differ from each other only in conception,\r\nonly as the statical differs from the dynamical, it is reasonable, nay,\r\nin the circumstances it is alone legitimate, to suppose that it is not\r\nin virtue of some absolute difference in substance (for none appears),\r\nbut only from differences in the quantity or intensity of substance\r\nor power in the individual, and from the variety of their build,\r\nthat different individuals display such different potentialities or\r\nendowments as they do display; and come to be justly classified as\r\nthey are into various orders of beings. Inasmuch as the Author of all\r\nis Himself a Spiritual Being, cosmical law leads us to expect that\r\nthe type of created being shall be spirit also. Nor can Being in any\r\nobject be so attenuated or so far removed from Him who filleth all in\r\nall, but it must surely retain an aura of the spiritual nature. This,\r\nthen, is the corner-stone of Keely's philosophy--one power; one law;\r\norder and method reigning throughout creation; spirit controlling\r\nmatter; as the divine order and law of creation, that the spiritual\r\nshould govern the material,--that the whole realm of matter should\r\nbe under the dominion of the world of spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen Keely's discovery has been made known to scientists, a new\r\nfield of research will be opened up in the realm of Philosophy, where\r\nall eternal, physical, and metaphysical truths are correlated; for\r\nPhilosophy has been well defined by Willcox as the science of that\r\nhuman thought which contains all human knowledges. He who possesses\r\nthe structure of philosophic wisdom built up of all knowledges--grand\r\nand sublime--has a mental abode wherein to dwell which other men have\r\nnot. Dr. Macvicar says:--\"The nearer we ascend to the fountain-head\r\nof being and of action, the more magical must everything inevitably\r\nbecome, for that fountain-head is pure volition. And pure volition,\r\nas a cause, is precisely what is meant by magic; for by magic is\r\nmerely meant a mode of producing a phenomenon without mechanical\r\nappliances--that is, without that seeming continuity of resisting\r\nparts and that leverage which satisfy our muscular sense and\r\nour imagination, and bring the phenomenon into the category of\r\nwhat we call 'the natural'--that is, the sphere of the elastic,\r\nthe gravitating, the sphere into which the vis inertiæ is alone\r\nadmitted.\" In Keely's philosophy, as in Dr. Macvicar's \"Sketch of a\r\nPhilosophy,\" the economy of creation is not regarded as a theory of\r\ndevelopment all in one direction, which is the popular supposition,\r\nbut as a cycle in which, after development and as its fruit, the last\r\nterm gives again the first. Herein is found the link by which the\r\nlaw of continuity is maintained throughout, and the cycle of things\r\nis made to be complete:--the link which is missing in the popular\r\nscience of the day, with this very serious consequence, that, to\r\nkeep the break out of sight, the entire doctrine of spirit and the\r\nspiritual world is ignored or denied altogether.\r\n\r\nJoseph Cook affirms that, \"as science progresses, it draws nearer\r\nin all its forms to the proof of the spiritual origin of force--that\r\nis, of the divine immanence in natural law. God was not transiently\r\npresent in nature--that is, in a mere creative moment; nor has He now\r\nleft the world in a state of orphanage, bereft of a deific influence\r\nand care, but He is immanent in nature, as the Apostle Paul affirmed:\r\nIn Him we live, and are moved, and have our being; as certainly as\r\nthe unborn infant's life is that of the mother, so it is divinely\r\ntrue that somehow God's life includes ours.\"\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of Keely sets forth the universal ether (denied by\r\nscientists in the last century to suit their views of the celestial\r\nspaces, which they declared to be a vacuum) as the medium by which our\r\nlives are included in God's life; demonstrating how it is that we live\r\nbecause He lives, and shall live as long as He exists: how our being\r\nis comprised in His, so that if we could suppose the divine life to\r\ncome to an end, ours would terminate with it as surely--to compare\r\ngreat things with small--as a stream would cease to flow when its\r\nfountain is dried up; teaching that our existence may be distinct,\r\nbut never separate from His, and that in the hidden depth of the\r\nsoul there is somewhere a point where our individual being comes in\r\ncontact with God, and is identified with the infinite life.\r\n\r\n\"If extreme vicissitudes of belief on the part of men of science are\r\nevidence of uncertainty, it may be affirmed that, of all kinds of\r\nknowledge, none is more uncertain than science.\" The existence of the\r\nuniversal ether is now affirmed again, and must be affirmed, as one\r\nof the most elementary facts in physical science. Sir J. F. Herschel\r\nasserts that, supposing the ether to be analogous to other elastic\r\nmedia, an amount of it equal in quantity of matter to that which is\r\ncontained in a cubic inch of air (which weighs about one-third of a\r\ngrain), if enclosed in a cube of one inch in the side, would exert\r\na bursting power of upwards of seventeen billions of pounds on each\r\nside of the cube, while common air exerts only fifteen pounds. It\r\nshould not, therefore, be surprising to those who have witnessed the\r\nmanifestations of etheric force, as exhibited by Keely in producing\r\na pressure ranging from 8000 to 30,000 pounds to the square inch,\r\nwhen modern scientists support Herschel's views, as they do,\r\nunhesitatingly; rather should they be surprised at the marvellous\r\nperseverance which has kept Keely, in the face of every discouragement,\r\ntrue to his inspired mission; conquering every difficulty, surmounting\r\nevery obstacle, and turning his mistakes into stepping-stones which\r\nhave helped him to attain the goal he has, from the start, aimed at\r\nreaching--viz. the utilizing in mechanics of the power he discovered\r\nmany years ago. Before the grandeur and glory of such an attainment,\r\nall things had to give way. Like a General who sees the fortress\r\nlooming up in the distance which he must take to complete his victory,\r\nhis horse's hoofs trampling the dead and dying in his path, so has\r\nthis discoverer and inventor been unmindful of all that lay between\r\nhim and his goal. Taking for the key-note of his experiments, in\r\napplying inter-molecular vapour to the running of an engine, that all\r\nthe movements of elastic elements are rhythmical, he has had problems\r\nto solve which needed the full measure of inspiration he has received\r\nbefore he could attain that degree of success which he has now reached.\r\n\r\nMr. Keely realizes the full extent of the difficulties which he yet\r\nhas to contend with in obtaining continuity of action, though, with his\r\nsanguine temperament, anticipating near and complete success. To quote\r\nfrom his writings:--\"The mathematics of vibratory etheric science,\r\nboth pure and applied, require long and arduous research. It seems to\r\nme that no man's life is sufficient, with the most intense application,\r\nto cover more than the introductory branch. The theory of elliptic\r\nfunctions, the calculus of probabilities, are but as pigmies in\r\ncomparison to a science which requires the utmost tension of the\r\nhuman mind to grasp. But let us wait patiently for the light that\r\nwill come--that is even now dawning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n            All we can dream of loveliness within,\r\n              All ever hoped for by a will intense,\r\n              This shall one day be palpable to sense,\r\n            And earth at last become to heaven akin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese four lines, from Robert Browning's sonnet on Keely's discoveries,\r\nread like an inspired insight into that \"Age of Harmony,\" which\r\ninterpreters of scripture prophecies anticipate the twentieth century\r\nwill usher into our world; recalling Shakespeare's seeming knowledge,\r\nbefore Harvey's discovery even, of the circulation of the blood. \"All\r\ntruth is inspired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE KEY TO THE PROBLEMS. KEELY'S SECRETS.\r\n\r\n        Causa latet, vis est notissima.--Proverb.\r\n\r\n        (The cause is hidden, the power is most apparent.)\r\n        Electricity is in principle as material as water; so it\r\n        appears, and Mr. Carl Hering has expressed the fact with\r\n        much of clearness and force. He says, \"It is a well-known\r\n        fact that the quantity of electricity measured in coulombs\r\n        never is generated, never is consumed, and never does grow\r\n        less, excepting leakage. The current flowing out of a lamp is\r\n        exactly the same in quantity as that going into it; the same\r\n        is true of motors and of generators, showing that electricity\r\n        of itself is neither consumed while doing work nor is it\r\n        generated. After doing work in a lamp or motor, it comes\r\n        out in precisely the same quantity as it entered. A battery\r\n        is not able to generate quantity or coulombs of electricity;\r\n        all it is able to do is to take the quantity which pours in at\r\n        one pole, and sends out at the other pole with an increased\r\n        pressure. Electricity, therefore, is not merely force (or\r\n        a form of energy), but matter. It is precisely analogous to\r\n        water in a water circuit....--The Court Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of Aristotle concerning heat, viz. that it is a condition of\r\nmatter, together with the dicta of Locke, Davy, Rumford, and Tyndall,\r\nhave been consigned of late by many to the tomb of exploded theories,\r\nand are replaced by those of Lavoisier and Black, which make caloric an\r\nactual substance. The Rev. J. J. Smith, M.A., D.D., tells us that the\r\nonly way the great problem of the universe can ever be scientifically\r\nsolved is by studying, and arriving at just conclusions with regard\r\nto, the true nature and character of force. He maintains, in his\r\npaper upon \"The Unity and Origin of Force,\" that, as it is the great\r\norganizer of matter, it must not only be superior to it, but also\r\nmust have been prior, as it existed before organization commenced,\r\nand immanent always. Newton, who scoffed at Epicurus's idea that\r\n\"gravitation is essential and inherent in matter,\" asserted that\r\ngravity must be caused by an agent acting, constantly, according to\r\ncertain laws. Heat, gravity, light, electricity, magnetism, chemical\r\naffinities, are all different phases of the primal force discovered by\r\nKeely, and all these forces, it is said, can be obtained from a single\r\nray of sunlight. \"The evidence of unity or oneness even between the\r\nphysical, vital, mental, and spiritual is seen in the light of this law\r\nof correlation,\" says Smith. \"A great portion of our muscles contract\r\nand relax in obedience to our wills, thereby proving that the mental\r\nforce can be, and is, in every such instance actually converted into\r\nthe muscular or the physical.\" Keely demonstrates the truth of this\r\nassertion, claiming that \"all forces are indestructible, immaterial,\r\nand homogeneous entities, having their origin and unity in one great\r\nintelligent personal will force.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll says:--\"We know nothing of the ultimate seat of\r\nforce. Science, in the modern doctrine of conservation of energy,\r\nand the convertibility of forces, is already getting something\r\nlike a firm hold of the idea that all kinds of forces are but\r\nforms or manifestations of some one central force, issuing from\r\nsome one fountain-head of power.\" It is Keely's province to prove to\r\nmaterialists--to the world--that this one fountain-head is none other\r\nthan the Omnipotent and all-pervading Will-Force of the Almighty,\r\n\"which upholds, guides, and governs, not only our world, but the\r\nentire universe. This important truth is destined to shiver the\r\ntottering fabric of materialism into fragments at no distant day.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor George Bush writes:--\"The progress of scientific research, at\r\nthe present day, has distinguished itself not less by the wideness of\r\nthe field over which its triumphs have spread, than by the soundness\r\nand certainty of the inductions by which it is sustained. It is\r\nequally indisputable that we are approximating the true philosophy\r\nwhich underlies the enlarged and enlarging spiritual experiences and\r\nphenomena of the current age. That this philosophy, when reached,\r\nwill conduct us into the realm of the spiritual as the true region of\r\ncauses, and disclose new and unthought-of relations between the world\r\nof matter and of mind, is doubtless a very reasonable anticipation,\r\nand one that even now is widely, though vaguely, entertained.\"\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians worshipped Ra, their name for the sun, and Ammon,\r\nthe emblem of a mysterious power concealed from human perception. The\r\nSupreme Being is the grand central spiritual sun, the source and centre\r\nof all life, \"whose revelation is traced in imperishable figures\r\nof universal harmony on the face of Cosmos.\" \"The outward visible\r\nworld is but the clothing of the invisible,\" wrote Coleridge. \"The\r\nwhole world process, in its content,\" says von Hartmann, \"is only a\r\nlogical process; but in its existence a continued act of will.\" Lilly\r\ncontinues, \"That is what physical law means. Reason and Will are\r\ninseparably united in the universe, as they are in idea. If we will\r\nanything, it is for some reason. In contemplating the structure of the\r\nuniverse, we cannot resist the conclusion that the whole is founded\r\nupon a distinct idea.\"\r\n\r\nKeely demonstrates the harmony of this \"distinct idea\" throughout\r\ncreation, and shows us that \"the sun is the visible effluence and\r\nagent, earthward, of the Being without whose prior design and decree\r\nthere would be no order and no systematic rule on earth,\" as well\r\nas that in \"the universal ether\" we find the link between mind and\r\nmatter. \"There is more of heaven than of earth, in all terrestrial\r\nthings; more of spirit than of matter in what are termed material\r\nlaws.\" Lange, with prophetic tongue, says that this age of materialism\r\nmay prove to be but the stillness before the storm which bursts from\r\nunknown gulfs to give a new shape to the world. Inch by inch, step by\r\nstep, physical science has marched towards its desired goal--the verge\r\nof physical nature, says Alcott. When it was thought that the verge\r\nwas reached, that the mysteries which lay beyond were for ever barred\r\nto mortals by the iron gate of death, then the discoveries of Faraday,\r\nEdison, and Crookes pushed further away the chasm which separates the\r\nconfessedly knowable from the fancied unknowable, and whole domains\r\npreviously undreamt of were suddenly exposed to view. Not long since,\r\nCanon Wilberforce asked Keely what would become of his discovery and\r\nhis inventions in case of his death before they became of commercial\r\nvalue to the public. Keely replied that he had written thousands of\r\npages, which he hoped would, in such an event, be mastered by some\r\nmind capable of pursuing his researches to practical ends; but in\r\nthe opinion of the writer, there is no man living who is fitted for\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nDiogenes of Apollonia identified the reason that regulated the world\r\nwith the original substance, air. Keely teaches that \"the original\r\nsubstance\" is ether, not air; and that the world is regulated through\r\nthis ether by its Creator. There are many molecules which contain no\r\nair--not one molecule that does not contain the one true \"original\r\nsubstance,\" ether.\r\n\r\nUp to 1888 Keely was still pursuing the wrong line of research, still\r\ntrying to construct an engine which could hold the ether in \"a rotating\r\ncircle of etheric force;\" still ignorant of the impossibility of ever\r\nreaching commercial success on that line. It was the end of the year\r\nbefore he could be brought to entirely abandon his \"perfect engine;\"\r\nand to confine himself to researches, which he had been pursuing\r\nin connection with his repeated failures on the commercial line,\r\nto gain more knowledge of the laws which govern the operation of the\r\nforce that, like a \"Will-o'-the-wisp,\" seemed to delight in leading\r\nhim astray.\r\n\r\nUp to this time his researching devices had been principally of his own\r\nconstruction; but from the time that he devoted himself to the line\r\nof research, marked out for him to follow, he was supplied with the\r\nbest instruments that opticians could make for him after the models\r\nor designs which he furnished. If, from 1882 to 1888, he walked with\r\ngiant strides along the borders of the domain that he had entered,\r\nfrom 1888 to the present time he has made the same progress beyond its\r\nborders. From the hour in which he grasped \"the key to the problem,\"\r\nthe \"principle underlying all,\" the dawn of \"a new order of things,\"\r\nbroke upon his vision, and he was no longer left at the mercy of the\r\ngenii whom he had aroused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, 1888, the T.P.S. published the succeeding paper, which had\r\na wide circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEELY'S SECRETS. 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I.\r\n\r\n        Science is to know things.--Herodotus.\r\n\r\n        Knowledge is developed by experience from innate ideas.--Plato.\r\n\r\n        Truth is not attained through reflection, but through immediate\r\n        intuition. \"We neither originate thought nor its form.--Aryan\r\n        Teachings.\r\n\r\n        It may be said that if all things come from only one cause or\r\n        internal source, acting within itself, then motion and matter\r\n        must be fundamentally and essentially one and the same, and\r\n        we may look upon matter as being latent force and upon force\r\n        as being free matter.--Franz Hartmann, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Worrell Keely--the discoverer of compound inter-etheric force,\r\nas the result of more than twenty years of persistent effort to apply\r\nthis force to the operation of machinery has, at last, been enabled\r\nto produce partial continuity of motion in his engine; but, up to\r\nthis time, he has not so mastered this subtle force as to control\r\nreversions. The development of his various discoveries has been one\r\nuninterrupted work of evolution, reaching, within the last year, he\r\nthinks, the sphere of perfect vibratory sympathy, both theoretically\r\nand practically. The proof of this is found in the fact that he now\r\ntransmits vibrations along a wire, connected at one end with the\r\nvibratory machine which is the source of power, and at its other end\r\nwith the engine or cannon, as the case may be, which is operated by\r\nsuch vibratory power. Until recently, comparatively speaking, Keely\r\nstored force, as he generated it, in a receiver; and experiments were\r\nmade by him in the presence of thousands, at various times, for the\r\npurpose of testing the operations of this force, liberated in the\r\npresence of his audience and stored up in this small receiver. The\r\neditor of the Scientific Arena thus describes what took place at one\r\nof these exhibitions, when he was present:--\"The confined vapour was\r\npassed through one of the small flexible tubes to a steel cylinder\r\non another table, in which a vertical piston was fitted so that its\r\nupper end bore against the underside of a powerful, weighted lever. The\r\nsuperficial area of this piston was equal to one-half of a square inch,\r\nand it acted as a movable fulcrum placed close to the hinged end of\r\nthe short arm of this lever, whose weight alone required a pressure\r\nof 1500 pounds to the square inch against the piston to lift it.\r\n\r\n\"After testing the pressure by several small weights, added to that\r\nof the lever itself, in order, to determine how much power had already\r\nbeen accumulated in the receiver, the maximum test was made by placing\r\nan iron weight of 580 pounds, by means of a differential pulley, on the\r\nextreme end of the long arm of the lever. To lift this weight, without\r\nthat of the lever supporting it, would require a pressure against the\r\npiston of 18,900 pounds to the square inch, counting the difference\r\nin the length of the two arms and the area of the piston, which we,\r\nas well as several others present, accurately calculated. When all was\r\nready, and the crowded gathering had formed as well as possible to see\r\nthe test, Keely turned the valve-wheel leading from the receiver to\r\nthe flexible tube, and through it into the steel cylinder beneath the\r\npiston, and simultaneously with the motion of his hand the weighted\r\nlever shot up against its stop, a distance of several inches, as if\r\nthe great mass of iron had been only cork. Then, in order to assure\r\nourselves of the full 25,000 pounds to the square inch claimed, we\r\nadded most of our weight to the arm of the lever without forcing the\r\npiston back again.\r\n\r\n\"After repeating this experiment till all expressed themselves\r\nsatisfied, Keely diverted his etheric gas to the exciting work of\r\nfiring a cannon, into which he placed a leaden bullet about an inch\r\nin diameter. He conveyed the force from the receiver by the same\r\nkind of flexible copper tube, attaching one end of it to the breech\r\nof the gun. When all was again in readiness he gave a quick turn to\r\nthe inlet valve, and a report like that of a small cannon followed,\r\nthe ball passing through an inch board and flattening itself out\r\nto about three inches in diameter, showing the marvellous power and\r\ninstantaneous action of this strange vapour.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty encountered by Keely in his old generator of etheric\r\nforce grew out of the fact, in part, that the vaporic power produced\r\nwas so humid that he could not, when he attempted to utilize it, obtain\r\nits theoretical value in work. This difficulty has been entirely\r\novercome by dispensing with the water which he used in liberating\r\netheric force, by his old generator; and, by this departure, he has\r\nattained a success beyond that which was anticipated by himself,\r\nwhen he abandoned his original line of experiment. [4]\r\n\r\nIgnorant, indeed, of the nature of Keely's work must those men be\r\nwho accuse him of \"abandoning his base\" or \"principle,\" each time\r\nthat he discovers his mistakes:--using them as stepping-stones to\r\napproach nearer and still nearer to his goal. Reproaching him, even,\r\nfor keeping his own counsel, until certainty of success rendered\r\nit prudent for him to make known that he had changed his field of\r\nexperiment from positive attraction to negative attraction.\r\n\r\nEqually ignorant are those, who would wrench by force his secrets\r\nfrom him before the time is ripe for their disclosure. Let us suppose\r\nthat Faraday, when he discovered radiant matter in 1816, had formed a\r\n\"Faraday Phospho-Genetic Radiant Company,\" to enable him to experiment:\r\nfully cognizant of all that Crookes has since discovered, and had\r\ntaken for his base in experimenting the principle involved in Crookes's\r\ndiscovery. Not succeeding at first, we will suppose that the Company\r\nbecame clamorous for returns, and demanded that his secret principle\r\nshould be made public. Had he been driven into making it known, who\r\nwould have credited what Crookes is now able to prove? The effect\r\nwould have been upon the Faraday Company the same as if a balloon were\r\npunctured just as it was soaring heavenward. The same with the Keely\r\nMotor Company, had Keely obeyed the order of the Court in 1882, and\r\nmade his marvellous secret public. It would have collapsed. Therefore,\r\nhe has maintained his secret in the interests of the stockholders\r\nof the Keely Motor Company with a firmness worthy of a Christian\r\nmartyr. The one person to whom alone Keely then disclosed it thought\r\nhim under a delusion, until he had demonstrated its soundness.\r\n\r\nCharles B. Collier, Keely's patent lawyer, writes as follows,\r\nconcerning the difficulties attendant upon \"the supposed duty\" of\r\nhis client's imparting his \"secrets,\" as ordered by the Court to do,\r\nsome time since:--\r\n\r\n\"If to-day, for the first time in your lives, you saw a harp, attuned\r\nand being played upon, and the science of music was unknown to you,\r\nyou would hardly expect, without considerable time and study, to be\r\nable to reproduce the harp, attune its strings in proper relation to\r\neach other, and to play upon it so as to produce the harmonies which\r\nyou had listened to. Mr. Keely's work is analogous to the illustration\r\nwhich I have presented, inasmuch as he is dealing with the subject\r\nof sound, or acoustics, but in a much more involved form than as\r\napplied simply for the production of harmonies for the delight of\r\nthe ear. Mr. Keely's engine is analogous to the mechanism of the\r\nhuman ear, in the respect that it is a structure operated upon,\r\nand its motion induced by vibration; and to the end of securing and\r\nattaining, in and by it, uniformity or regularity of motion, there\r\nmust be perfect unison, or synchronism, as between it and his structure\r\nwhich is the prime source of vibration. To attain this perfect unison\r\nor synchronism, has involved unparalleled research and experiment\r\nupon his part--experiments that have varied from day to day. No one,\r\nin my opinion, who had not stood by his side, as his shadow, watching\r\nevery experiment, could have kept fully abreast of him. To pursue my\r\nsimile, I may say that his harp (engine) is not yet perfectly attuned\r\n(\"graduated\"); when it is so, it will produce nothing but harmony\r\n(regularity of motion), and his work will be finished.\r\n\r\n\"At such time, I doubt not that he will be able to give to Mr. Boekel,\r\nmyself or another, the scale with which to reconstruct and attune\r\nanother apparatus so as to produce like results with it; but to go\r\nover the ground that he has gone over, to explore the wilderness in\r\nwhich he has been the pioneer, in other words, the study, to a full\r\nunderstanding of them, of his experiments and researches, as recorded\r\nin his writings and illustrated in the beautiful charts which he has\r\nproduced, will be a work rather for scientists than for mechanicians\r\nor engineers.\"\r\n\r\nKeely's \"Theoretical Exposé\" is in preparation for the press; and, when\r\nthese volumes are issued, we may look for a change of attitude towards\r\nhim in all men who hold themselves \"ready to abandon, preconceived\r\nnotions, however cherished, if they be found to contradict truths;\"\r\nwhich, Herbert Spencer says, is the first condition of success\r\nin scientific research. The Rev. J. J. Smith, M.A., D.D., tells\r\nus that the only way the great problem of the universe can ever be\r\nscientifically solved is by studying, and arriving at just conclusions\r\nwith regard to the true nature and character of force. This has\r\nbeen Mr. Keely's life study; and he is able to demonstrate all that\r\nhe asserts.\r\n\r\nLaurence Oliphant writes: \"Recent scientific research has proved\r\nconclusively that all force is atomic--that electricity consists\r\nof files of particles, and that the interstellar spaces contain\r\nsubstances, whether it be called ether or astral fluid (or by any\r\nother name), which is composed of atoms, because it is not possible\r\nto dissever force from its transmitting medium. The whole universe,\r\ntherefore, and all that it contains, consists of matter in motion,\r\nand is animated by a vital principle which we call God.\r\n\r\n\"Science has further discovered that these atoms are severally\r\nencompassed by an ethereal substance which prevents their touching\r\neach other, and to this circumambient, inter-atomic element they have\r\ngiven the name of dynasphere; but, inasmuch as has further been found,\r\nthat in these dynaspheres there resides a tremendous potency, it is\r\nevident that they also must contain atoms, and that these atoms must in\r\ntheir turn be surrounded by dynaspheres, which again contain atoms, and\r\nso on ad infinitum. Matter thus becomes infinite and indestructible,\r\nand the force which pervades it persistent and everlasting.\r\n\r\n\"This dynaspheric force, which is also called etheric, is conditioned\r\nas to its nature on the quality of the atoms which form its\r\ntransmitting media; and which are infinite both in variety and in\r\ntheir combinations. They may, however, be broadly divided into two\r\ncategories; viz. the sentient and the non-sentient atoms. Dynaspheric\r\nforce, composed of non-sentient atoms, is the force that has been\r\nalready mechanically applied by Mr. Keely to his motor; and which will\r\nprobably ere long supersede the agencies now used for locomotive,\r\nprojectile, and other purposes. When the laws which govern it come\r\nto be understood, it will produce materially a great commercial and\r\nindustrial revolution....\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable illustration of the stupendous energy of\r\natomic vibratory force is to be found in that singular apparatus in\r\nPhiladelphia--which for the last fifteen years has excited in turn the\r\namazement, the scepticism, the admiration, and the ridicule of those\r\nwho have examined it--called 'Keely's Motor'\" ... \"In the practical\r\nland of its origin, it has popularly been esteemed a fraud. I have\r\nnot examined it personally, but I believe it to be based upon a sound\r\nprinciple of dynamics, and to be probably the first of a series of\r\ndiscoveries destined to revolutionize all existing mechanical theories,\r\nand many of the principles upon which they are founded.\" ... \"Those\r\nwho are sufficiently unprejudiced to connect the bearings of this\r\ndiscovery, of what must be dynaspheric force, with phenomena which\r\nhave hitherto been regarded as supernatural by the ignorant, will\r\nperceive how rapidly we are bridging over the chasm which has divided\r\nthe seen from the unseen.\"...\r\n\r\nIn 1882 a lady, conversing with Mr. Keely, said, \"You have opened the\r\ndoor into the spirit-world.\" He answered, \"Do you think so? I have\r\nsometimes thought I might be able to discover the origin of life.\" At\r\nthis time Mr. Keely had given no attention whatever to the occult\r\nbearing of his discovery; and it was only after he had pursued his\r\nresearches, under the advantages which his small Liberator afforded\r\nhim for such experiments, that he realized the truth of this woman's\r\nassertion. It was then, in 1887, that a \"bridge of mist\" formed itself\r\nbefore him, connecting the laws which govern physical science with the\r\nlaws which govern spiritual science, and year by year this bridge of\r\nmist has solidified, until now he is in a position to stand upon it,\r\nand proclaim that its abutments have a solid foundation--one resting\r\nin the material and visible world, and the other in the spiritual\r\nand unseen world; or, rather, that no bridge is needed to connect\r\nthe two worlds, one law governing both in its needed modifications.\r\n\r\n\"The physical thing,\" writes a modern scientist, \"which energizes\r\nand does work in and upon ordinary matter, is a separate form of\r\nmatter, infinitely refined, and infinitely rapid in its vibrations,\r\nand is thus able to penetrate through all ordinary matter, and to make\r\neverywhere a fountain of motion, no less real because unseen. It is\r\namong the atoms of the crystal and the molecules of living matter;\r\nand, whether producing locked effects or free, it is the same cosmic\r\nthing, matter in motion, which we conceive as material energy, and\r\nwith difficulty think of as only a peculiar form of matter in motion.\"\r\n\r\nThe President of the British Association, Sir Henry Roscoe, in his\r\naddress before that body, said: \"In nature there is no such thing\r\nas great or small; the structure of the smallest particle, invisible\r\neven to our most searching vision, may be as complicated as that of\r\nany of the heavenly bodies which circle round our sun.\" As to the\r\nindivisibility of the atom, he asks this question: \"Notwithstanding\r\nthe properties of these elements have been studied, and are now\r\nknown with a degree of precision formerly undreamt of, have the\r\natoms of our present elements been made to yield?\" He continues:\r\n\"A negative answer must undoubtedly be given, for even the highest\r\nof terrestrial temperatures, that of the electric spark, has failed\r\nto shake any one of these atoms in two.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an error, for it is well known by those who are fully\r\nacquainted with the principle involved in Keely's inventions that\r\nthe intense vibratory action which is induced in his \"Liberator\"\r\nhas accomplished what the retort of the chemist has failed to do,\r\nwhat the electric spark has left intact, and what the inconceivably\r\nfierce temperature of the sun and of volcanic fires has turned over to\r\nus unscathed. The mighty Genii imprisoned within the molecule, thus\r\nreleased from the chains and fetters which Nature forged, has been\r\nfor years the tyrant of the one who rashly intruded, without first\r\npaving the way with the gold which he has since been accused of using\r\nin experiments with reckless and wanton waste! For more than a score\r\nof years has Keely been fighting a hand-to-hand fight with this Genii;\r\noften beaten back by it, paralyzed at times, even, by its monstrous\r\nblows; and only now so approaching its subjugation as to make it safe\r\nto harness it for the work that is calling for a power mightier than\r\nsteam, safer and more uniform in operation than electricity; a power\r\nwhich, by its might and beneficence, will ameliorate the condition\r\nof the masses, and reconcile and solve all that now menaces our race:\r\nas it was never menaced before, as has been said.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the air molecule, as believed in by Keely, is as\r\nfollows:--Broken up, by vibratory action, he finds it to contain what\r\nhe calls an atomic triplet. The position of a molecule, on the point\r\nof a fine cambric needle sustains the same relation to the point of\r\nthe needle that a grain of sand sustains to a field of ten acres.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as Sir H. Roscoe has said, \"In nature there is no such thing\r\nas great or small,\" the human mind cannot conceive such infinitesimal\r\nminuteness. We will, then, imagine a molecule magnified to the size\r\nof a billiard ball, and the atomic triplet magnified to the size\r\nof three marbles, in the triangular position, within that molecule,\r\nat its centre; unless acted upon by electricity, when the molecule,\r\nthe billiard ball, becomes oblate, and the three atoms are ranged\r\nin a line within, unless broken up by the mighty force of vibratory\r\naction. Nature never gives us a vacuum; consequently, the space within\r\nthe molecule not occupied by the atomic triplet must e filled with\r\nsomething. This is where the Genii--\"the all-pervading ether\"--has\r\nmade its secret abode through untold æons, during which our world\r\nhas been in course of preparation for its release, to fulfil its\r\nappointed task in advancing the progress of the human race.\r\n\r\nStep by step, with a patient perseverance which some day the world\r\nwill honour, this man of genius has made his researches, overcoming\r\nthe colossal difficulties which have raised up in his path what\r\nseemed to be insurmountable barriers to further progress: but never\r\nbefore has the world's index finger so pointed to an hour when all\r\nis making ready for the advent of the new form of force that mankind\r\nis waiting for. Nature, always reluctant to yield her secrets, is\r\nlistening to the demands made upon her by her master, necessity. The\r\ncoal mines of the world cannot long afford the increasing drain made\r\nupon them. Steam has reached its utmost limits of power, and does\r\nnot fulfil the requirements of the age. Electricity holds back, with\r\nbated breath, dependent upon the approach of her sister colleague. Air\r\nships are riding at anchor, as it were, waiting for the force which\r\nis to make aerial navigation something more than a dream. As easily\r\nas men communicate with their offices from their homes by means of\r\nthe telephone, so will the inhabitants of separate continents talk\r\nacross the ocean. Imagination is palsied when seeking to foresee the\r\ngrand results of this marvellous discovery when once it is applied\r\nto art and mechanics. In taking the throne which it will force steam\r\nto abdicate, dynaspheric force will rule the world with a power so\r\nmighty in the interests of civilization, that no finite mind can\r\nconjecture the results.\r\n\r\nIn 1746, when Franklin's attention was drawn to the phenomena of\r\nelectricity, little more was known on the subject than Thales had\r\nannounced two thousand years before. Von Kleist in Leyden, Collinson\r\nin London, and others in as widely-separated cities in Europe, were\r\nexperimenting in the same field of research. What our last century\r\nhas done toward subduing this tyrant which Franklin succeeded in\r\nbringing down to earth, from the clouds, the next century will see\r\nsurpassed beyond man's wildest conjectures, should Keely's utilization\r\nof this unknown force of nature bestow upon humanity the costless\r\nmotive power, which he anticipates it will. Reynolds predicted that\r\nthose who \"studied the mysteries of molecular vibration would win the\r\nvictorious wreaths of successful discovery.\" After such discoveries\r\nas Mr. Keely has made in this field of research, it matters not to\r\nhim whether he succeeds commercially or not. His work of discovery\r\ncommenced when, as a boy of twelve, he held the sea-shells to his\r\near as he walked the shore and noted that no two gave forth the\r\nsame tone. From the construction of his first crude instrument,\r\nhis work of evolution progressed slowly for years; but within the\r\nlast five years he has made giant strides towards the \"Dark Tower\"\r\nwhich is his last fortress to take. When he is ready, \"Dauntless the\r\nslug-horn to his lips\" he will set; and the world will hear the blast,\r\nand awaken from its slumber into new life.\r\n\r\nMolecular vibration is thus seen to be Keely's legitimate field of\r\nresearch; but more than once has he had to tear down portions of\r\nthe vibratory scaffolding which aided him in the building up of his\r\nedifice of philosophy; therefore, he is ever ready to admit that\r\nsome of the present scaffolding may have to be removed. The charge\r\nof \"abandoning his base,\" recently brought against him by one of\r\nthe editors of The New York Times, could only have been made by one\r\nwho is utterly ignorant of the subject upon which he writes. Under\r\nthe heading \"A Cool Confession,\" this editor asserts that Keely has\r\n\"given up the Keely Motor as a bad job,\" and that he admits that he\r\nis a \"bogus inventor\" and a \"fraud.\" This is not true.\r\n\r\nWhat Keely does admit is that, baffled in applying vibratory force to\r\nmechanics, upon his first and second lines of experimental research,\r\nhe was obliged either to confess a commercial failure, or to try a\r\nthird departure from his base or principle; seeking success through\r\nanother channel of experiment. While experimenting upon this third\r\nline, until his efforts were crowned with success, he kept his secret\r\nfrom all men; with the approbation of the one who furnished the money\r\nfor these experiments. There is a time when silence is golden; and the\r\ncharge made by the same editor that Keely had been \"receiving money\r\nfrom the Keely Motor Company on false pretences from the time that\r\nhe abandoned his original plans,\" could only have been made by one\r\nwho knows nothing of the facts of the case: for years have passed\r\naway since the Keely Motor Company broke its contract with him,\r\nand since it has furnished him with any money for his experiments.\r\n\r\nBut let Keely speak for himself in reference to his work:--\r\n\r\n\"In considering the operation of my engine, the visitor, in order to\r\nhave even an approximate conception of its modus operandi, must discard\r\nall thought of engines that are operated upon the principle of pressure\r\nand exhaustion, by the expansion of steam or other analogous gas which\r\nimpinges upon an abutment, such as the piston of a steam-engine. My\r\nengine has neither piston nor eccentrics, nor is there one grain of\r\npressure exerted in the engine, whatever may be the size or capacity\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\"My system, in every part and detail, both in the developing of this\r\npower and in every branch of its utilization, is based and founded\r\non sympathetic vibration. In no other way would it be possible to\r\nawaken or develop this force, and equally impossible would it be to\r\noperate my engine upon any other principle.\r\n\r\n\"All that remains to be done is to secure a uniform speed under\r\ndifferent velocities and control reversions. That I shall accomplish\r\nthis is absolutely certain. Some few years ago, I contemplated using\r\na wire as a connective link between two sympathetic mediums, to\r\nevolve this power as also to operate my machinery--instead of tubular\r\nconnections as heretofore employed--I have only recently succeeded in\r\naccomplishing successfully such change. This, however, is the true\r\nsystem; and henceforth all my operations will be conducted in this\r\nmanner--that is to say, the power will be generated, my engines run,\r\nmy cannon operated, through a wire.\r\n\r\n\"It has been only after years of incessant labour, and the making of\r\nalmost innumerable experiments, involving not only the construction\r\nof a great many most peculiar mechanical structures, and the closest\r\ninvestigation and study of the phenomenal properties of the substance\r\n\"ether,\" per se, produced, that I have been able to dispense with\r\ncomplicated mechanism, and to obtain, as I claim, mastery over the\r\nsubtle and strange force with which I am dealing.\r\n\r\n\"When my present process of adjustment is completed, the force, the\r\nmechanism, and all that pertains to it, will be fully explained in a\r\ntheoretical exposition of the subject, with appropriate diagrams, which\r\nI shall publish to the world; through which medium, and my patents,\r\nwhen taken out, a knowledge of all that is required for its commercial\r\nemployment will be more easily acquired than is the necessary skill\r\nrequired to enable one to safely operate a steam-engine.\r\n\r\n\"The power will be adapted to engines of all sizes and capacities,\r\nas well to an engine capable of propelling the largest ship as to one\r\nthat will operate a sewing machine. Equally well and certain is it that\r\nit will be adapted as a projectile force for guns and cannons of all\r\nsizes, from the ordinary shoulder-piece to the heaviest artillery.\"....\r\n\r\nWhen Keely obtained continuity of motion (for a time) in his engine\r\nhe thought that his last difficulty had been overcome: but, up to\r\nthe present time, he has not succeeded in governing its speed nor in\r\ncontrolling reversions. He has, however, again reduced in size the\r\ninstrument with which he produces the force. From 1882 to 1884 the\r\n\"Generator\" was a structure six feet long and correspondingly wide and\r\nhigh; but, failing in his attempt to make an automatic arrangement\r\nupon which its usefulness in mechanics depended, Keely found a\r\nnew standard for research in an experiment often made by himself,\r\nbut never before successful, which resulted in the production of\r\na machine in 1885 which he named a \"Liberator\"--not so large as a\r\nlady's small round work-table. Continuing his labour of evolution\r\nKeely within one year made such astonishing progress, from experiments\r\nwith this beautiful piece of vibratory mechanism, as to combine the\r\nproduction of the power, and the operation of his cannon, his engine\r\nand his disintegrator in a machine no larger than a dinner plate, and\r\nonly three or four inches in thickness. This instrument was completed\r\nin 1886, up to which time his experiments had been conducted upon a\r\nprinciple of sympathetic vibration, for the purpose of liberating a\r\nvapoury or etheric product. His later experiments have been confined\r\nto another modification of vibratory sympathy; and the size of the\r\ninstrument used now, '88, for the same purposes is no larger than an\r\nold-fashioned silver watch, such as we see in Museum collections. The\r\nraising of a lever with an apparent uplifting expansive force of\r\nbetween 20,000 and 30,000 pounds to the square inch, the running of\r\nthe engine, the firing of the cannon, are conducted without one ounce\r\nof pressure in any part of the apparatus, and without the production\r\nor presence of what has been known as Keely's ether. The force is now\r\ntransmitted along a wire (of platinum and silver), and when the lever\r\nis lowered there is no exhaustion, into the atmosphere of the room,\r\nof any up-lifting vapour, as was always the case when the ether was\r\nused in this experiment; nor is there any vapour impinging upon the\r\npiston under the lever to raise it.\r\n\r\nKeely has named this new modification of the one force in nature\r\n\"Negative Attraction,\" which to the uninitiated does not suggest as\r\nmuch as it would had he called it \"Negative Humbug.\"\r\n\r\nThe two forms of force which he has been experimenting with, and the\r\nphenomena attending them, are the very antithesis of each other. Keely\r\ndoes not feel the shadow of a doubt as to his eventual success in\r\nproducing engines of varying capacities; small enough, on the one hand,\r\nto operate sewing machines with, and large enough, on the other hand,\r\nto propel the largest ships that plough the seas. Every fact and\r\nfeature surrounding the case warrants the belief, notwithstanding the\r\nincredulity of all who have not witnessed the progress of Mr. Keely,\r\nstep by step, that his success will be complete, and his work stand\r\nas the most colossal example of the survival of the fittest, in\r\nthe process of inventive evolution. Cox says: \"Not one of the great\r\nfacts which science now accepts as incontrovertible truths but was\r\nvehemently denied by the scientists of its time:--declared to be a\r\npriori impossible, its discoverers and supporters denounced as fools\r\nor charlatans, and even investigation of it refused as being a waste of\r\ntime and thought.\" \"History repeats itself,\" and Amiel's definition of\r\nscience gives the key to the incredulity of scientists in reference\r\nto Mr. Keely's discovery; for if, as Amiel has said, \"science is\r\na lucid madness occupied with tabulating its own hallucinations,\"\r\nit is not strange that men of science should refuse to investigate\r\nwhat they consider the hallucinations of others.\r\n\r\nIt is an undisputed fact that \"too much has been conceded to science,\r\ntoo little to those sublime laws which make science possible.\" But\r\nthe one law which regulates creation, and to which all other laws\r\nare made subservient, keeping in harmony the systems upon systems\r\nof worlds throughout space, developing sound and colour, animal and\r\nvegetable growth, the crystallization of minerals, is the hidden law,\r\nwhich develops every natural science throughout the universe; and which\r\nboth Kepler and Newton anticipated would be revealed in our age. \"You\r\ncan even trace the poles in sound,\" writes Mrs. F. J. Hughes, in her\r\nwork upon the \"Evolution of Tones and Colours.\" The experiments made\r\nby Mrs. Watts Hughes, at the annual Reception of the Royal Society,\r\nand the  [5]Pendulograph writings by Andrew of Belfast, have a bearing\r\nupon Keely's discovery; illustrating the workings of this hidden law\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nOf the law of periodicity, Hartmann writes: \"Its actions have long\r\nago been known to exist in the vibrations producing light and sound,\r\nand it has been recognized in chemistry by experiments tending to\r\nprove that all so-called simple elements are only various states of\r\nvibration of one primordial element, manifesting itself in seven\r\nprincipal modes of action, each of which may be subdivided into\r\nseven again. The difference which exists between so-called single\r\nsubstances appears, therefore, to be no difference of substance\r\nor matter, but only a difference of the function of matter in the\r\nratio of its atomic vibration.\" It is by changing the vibrations of\r\ncosmic ether that Mr. Keely releases this energy, and Dr. Kellner in\r\nAustria produces electricity in the same way; while it is said that\r\na chemist in Prague produces magnetism; also Dr. Dupuy, of New York,\r\nwho has been for years experimenting in this field without meeting\r\nwith Keely's progressive successes.\r\n\r\nHorace Wemyss Smith, in commenting upon the fact that, at the time\r\nof Franklin's discovery, men in France, in Belgium, in Holland,\r\nand in Germany were pursuing the same line of experiment, says that\r\nthere is something worthy of observation in the progress of science\r\nand human genius, inasmuch as in countries far distant from each\r\nother men have fallen into the same tracks, and have made similar\r\nand corresponding discoveries, at the same period of time, without\r\nthe least communication with each other.\r\n\r\nLaurence Oliphant's recent works give us the clue to an explanation\r\nof this fact; and Lowe, in his \"Fragments of Physiology,\" condenses\r\nthe answer in these words: \"Man is not the governor and commander of\r\nthe created world; and were it not for superhuman influence constantly\r\nflowing into created forms, the world would perish in a moment.\"\r\n\r\nThere are men in various parts of the world, unknown even by name to\r\neach other, who tell us by \"the signs of the times\" that the season\r\nof harvesting is approaching; the season for gathering the fruit,\r\nwhich has been deferred, century after century, because mankind is not\r\nyet ready, in the opinion of many, to share the fruit with one another.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that when Keely's vibratory force shall have taken\r\nthe place of steam-engines, the millions of working men who gain with\r\ndifficulty their daily bread by the work of their hands, will find\r\nthemselves without occupation. The same prediction was made in regard\r\nto steam, but instead we find the city of Boston giving work to thirty\r\nthousand men in one manufactory of boots and shoes by steam, in place\r\nof the three thousand shoemakers who were all that were occupied in\r\nthis branch of labour in that city when the work was done by hand.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellner's colleague, Franz Hartmann, M.D., writing in reference\r\nto Keely's discovery, says: \"I have taken great interest in him ever\r\nsince I first heard of him in 1882. As gaslight has driven away,\r\nin part, the smoky petroleum lamp, and is about to be displaced\r\nby electricity, which in the course of time may be supplanted by\r\nmagnetism, and as the power of steam has caused muscular labour to\r\ndisappear to a certain extent, and will itself give way before the\r\nnew vibratory force of Keely, likewise the orthodox medical quackery\r\nthat now prevails will be dethroned by the employment of the finer\r\nforces of nature, such as light, electricity, magnetism, etc.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the time is ripe, these are of the true scientists who will\r\ncome to the front \"to lead as progress leads,\" men who know how to\r\nwait upon God, viz., to work while waiting; and to such the end is,\r\nsooner or later, victory! \"God never hurries.\" He counts the centuries\r\nas we count the seconds, and the nearer we approach to the least\r\ncomprehension of His \"underlying purpose\" the more we become like\r\nTolstoi's labourer, who knew that the fruit was ripening for him\r\nand his fellow-men, trusting implicitly in the superior wisdom of\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nNo man, whose spiritual eyes have been opened to \"discern the signs\r\nof the times,\" can doubt that we are on the eve of revelations which\r\nare to usher in the dawn of a brighter day than our race has yet\r\nknown; and no prophecy of this brighter day, foretold by prophets,\r\napostles, and inspired poets, was ever made in truer strains than in\r\nthese glorious lines of Elizabeth Barrett Browning:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                Verily many thinkers of this age,\r\n            Aye, many Christian teachers, half in heaven,\r\n            Are wrong in just my sense who understood\r\n            Our natural world too insularly, as if\r\n            No spiritual counterpart completed it,\r\n            Consummating its meaning, rounding all\r\n            To justice and perfection, line by line,\r\n            Form by form, nothing single nor alone;\r\n            The Great Below clenched by the Great Above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II.\r\n\r\nOne Phase of Keely's Discovery in its Relations to the Cure or Disease.\r\n\r\n        I know medicine is called a science. It is nothing like a\r\n        science. It is a great humbug! Doctors are mere empirics when\r\n        they are not charlatans. We are as ignorant as men can be. Who\r\n        knows anything in the world about medicine? Gentlemen, you\r\n        have done me the honour to come here to attend my lectures,\r\n        and I must tell you now, frankly, in the beginning, that I\r\n        know nothing about medicine, nor do I know anyone who does\r\n        know anything about it. Nature does a great deal, imagination\r\n        does a great deal, doctors do devilish little when they do\r\n        not do harm. Sick people always feel they are neglected,\r\n        unless they are well drugged, les imbéciles!\r\n\r\n        Professor Magendie (before the students of his class in\r\n        \"The Allopathic College of Paris\").\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1871, the writer was sent from Paris to Schwalbach, by\r\nDr. Beylard, and recommended to the care of Dr. Adolph Genth. She said\r\nto the physician, \"I wish for your opinion and your advice, if you\r\ncan give it to me without giving me any medicine.\" He replied, \"With\r\nall my heart, madam; and I wish to God there were more women like you,\r\nbut we should soon lose most of our patients if we did not dose them.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a terrible excuse for the use of those agencies which Dr. John\r\nGood says have sent more human beings to their graves than war,\r\npestilence and famine combined. Keely holds the opinion that Nature\r\nworks under the one law of Compensation and Equilibrium--the law of\r\nHarmony; and that when disease indicates the disturbance of this law\r\nNature at once seeks to banish the disease by restoring equilibrium,\r\nHe seeks to render assistance on the same plan; replacing grossly\r\nmaterial agencies by the finer forces of nature; as has been so\r\nsuccessfully done by Dr. Pancoast and Dr. Babbitt in America.\r\n\r\n\"Nature,\" says Dr. Pancoast, author of The True Science of Light,\r\n\"works by antagonism in all her operations: when one of her forces\r\noverdoes its work, disease, or at least a local disorder, is the\r\nimmediate consequence; now, if we attack this force, and overcome it,\r\nthe opposite force has a clear field and may re-assert its rights--thus\r\nequilibrium is restored, and Equilibrium is health. The Sympathetic\r\nSystem, instead of attacking the stronger force, sends recruits to\r\nthe weaker one, and enables it to recover its powers; or, if the\r\ndisorder be the result of excessive tension of Nerves or Ganglia,\r\na negative remedy may be employed to reduce the tension. Thus, too,\r\nequilibrium is restored.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hartmann writes:--\r\n\r\nMr. Keely is perfectly right in saying that 'all disease is a\r\ndisturbance of the equilibrium between positive and negative\r\nforces.' In my opinion, no doctor ever cured any disease. All he\r\ncan possibly do is to establish conditions under which the patient\r\n(or nature) may cure himself.\r\n\r\nIf you enter the field of therapeutics and medicine, we find a\r\ndecided fermentation of new ideas; not among the fossil specimens of\r\nantediluvian quackery, but among those who are called \"irregulars,\"\r\nbecause they have the courage to depart from the tracks trodden out\r\nby their predecessors. The more intelligent classes of physicians\r\nhave long ago realized the fact that drugs and medicines are\r\nperfectly useless, excepting in cases where diseases can be traced\r\nto some mechanical obstruction, in some organ that may be reached\r\nby mechanical action. In all other cases our best physicians have\r\nbecome agnostics, leaving nature to have her own way, and observing\r\nthe expectative method, which, in fact, is no method of cure at all,\r\nbut merely consists in doing no harm to the patient. Recently,\r\nhowever, light, electricity, and magnetism have been employed;\r\nso that even in the medical guild the finer forces of nature are\r\ntaking the place of grossly material, and therefore injurious\r\nsubstances. The time is probably near when these finer forces\r\nwill be employed universally. Everybody knows that a note struck\r\nupon an instrument will produce sound in a correspondingly attuned\r\ninstrument in its vicinity. If connected with a tuning fork, it will\r\nproduce a corresponding sound in the latter; and if connected with\r\na thousand such tuning forks, it will make all the thousand sound,\r\nand produce a noise far greater than the original sound, without the\r\nlatter becoming any weaker for it. Here, then, is an augmentation or\r\nmultiplication of power. If we had any means to transform sound again\r\ninto mechanical motion, we would have a thousand-fold multiplication\r\nof mechanical motion. It would be presumptuous to say that it will\r\nnot be as easy for the scientists of the future to transform sound\r\ninto mechanical motion, as it is for the scientist of the present to\r\ntransform heat into electricity. Perhaps Mr. Keely has already solved\r\nthe problem. There is a fair prospect that in the very near future,\r\nwe shall have, in his ethereal force, a power far surpassing that\r\nof steam or electricity. Nor does the idea seem to be Utopian if\r\nwe remember that modern science heretofore only knew the law of the\r\nconservation of energy; while to the scientist of the future the law\r\nof the augmentation of energy will be unveiled.... As the age which\r\nhas passed away has been the age of steam, the coming era will be\r\nthe age of induction. There will be a universal rising up of lower\r\nvibrations into higher ones, in the realm of motion. Mr. Keely will,\r\nperhaps, transform sound into mechanical motion by applying the law\r\nof augmentation and multiplication of force.\"...\r\n\r\nKeely, writing on brain disturbance, says, In considering the mental\r\nforces as associated with the physical, I find, by my past researches,\r\nthat the convolutions which exist in the cerebral field are entirely\r\ngoverned by the sympathetic conditions that surround them.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, what are these aggregations and what do they\r\nrepresent, as being linked with physical impulses? They are simply\r\nvibrometric resonators, thoroughly subservient to sympathetic acoustic\r\nimpulses given to them by their atomic sympathetic surrounding media,\r\nall the sympathetic impulses that so entirely govern the physical\r\nin their many and perfect impulses (we are now discussing purity\r\nof conditions) are not emanations properly inherent in their own\r\ncomposition. They are only media--the acoustic media--for transferring\r\nfrom their vibratory surroundings the conditions necessary to the\r\npure connective link for vitalizing and bringing into action the\r\nvaried impulses of the physical.\r\n\r\nAll abnormal discordant aggregations in these resonating convolutions\r\nproduce differentiation to concordant transmission; and, according\r\nas these differentiations exist in volume, so the transmissions are\r\ndiscordantly transferred, producing antagonism to pure physical action.\r\n\r\nThus, in Motor Ataxy a differentiation of the minor thirds of the\r\nposterior parietal lobule produces the same condition between the\r\nretractors and extensors of the leg and foot; and thus the control of\r\nthe proper movements is lost through this differentiation. The same\r\ntruth can be universally applied to any of the cerebral convolutions\r\nthat are in a state of differential harmony to the mass of immediate\r\ncerebral surroundings. Taking the cerebral condition of the whole\r\nmass as one, it is subservient to one general head centre, although\r\nas many neutrals are represented as there are convolutions.\r\n\r\nThe introductory minors are controlled by the molecular; the\r\nnext progressive third by the atomic; and the high third by the\r\nEtheric. All these progressive links have their positive, negative,\r\nand neutral position. When we take into consideration the structural\r\ncondition of the human brain, we ought not to be bewildered by the\r\ninfinite variety of its sympathetic impulses; inasmuch as it unerringly\r\nproves the true philosophy that the mass chords of such structures are\r\ngoverned by vibratory etheric flows--the very material which composes\r\nthem. There is no structure whatever, animal, vegetable, mineral,\r\nthat is not built up from the universal cosmic ether. Certain orders\r\nof attractive vibration produce certain orders of structure; thus,\r\nthe infinite variety of effects--more especially in the cerebral\r\norgans. The bar of iron or the mass of steel, have, in each, all\r\nthe qualifications necessary, under certain vibratory impulses, to\r\nevolve all the conditions that govern that animal organism--the brain:\r\nand it is as possible to differentiate the molecular conditions of\r\na mass of metal of any shape so as to produce what you may express\r\nas a crazy piece of iron or a crazy piece of steel; or, vice versâ,\r\nan intelligent condition in the same.\r\n\r\nI find in my researches, as to the condition of molecules under\r\nvibration, that discordance cannot exist in the molecule proper;\r\nand that it is the highest and most perfect structural condition\r\nthat exists; providing that all the progressive orders are the\r\nsame. Discordance in any mass is the result of differentiated groups,\r\ninduced by antagonistic chords, and the flight or motions of such,\r\nwhen intensified by sound, are very tortuous and zig-zag; but when free\r\nof this differentiation are in straight lines. Tortuous lines denote\r\ndiscord, or pain; straight lines denote harmony, or pleasure. Any\r\ndifferentiated mass can be brought to a condition of harmony, or\r\nequation, by proper chord media, and an equated sympathy produced.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason for believing that insanity is simply a condition\r\nof differentiation in the mass chords of the cerebral convolutions,\r\nwhich creates an antagonistic molecular bombardment towards the neutral\r\nor attractive centres of such convolutions; which, in turn, produce a\r\nmorbid irritation in the cortical sensory centres in the substance of\r\nideation; accompanied, as a general thing, by sensory hallucinations,\r\nushered in by subjective sensations; such as flashes of light and\r\ncolour, or confused sounds and disagreeable odours, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThere is no condition of the human brain that ought not to be\r\nsympathetically coincident to that order of atomic flow to which its\r\nposition, in the cerebral field, is fitted. Any differentiation in\r\nthat special organ, or, more plainly, any discordant grouping tends\r\nto produce a discordant bombardment--an antagonistic conflict; which\r\nmeans the same disturbance transferred to the physical, producing\r\ninharmonious disaster to that portion of the physical field which is\r\ncontrolled by that especial convolution. This unstable aggregation\r\nmay be compared to a knot on a violin string. As long as this knot\r\nremains it is impossible to elicit, from its sympathetic surroundings,\r\nthe condition which transfers pure concordance to its resonating\r\nbody. Discordant conditions, i.e., differentiation of mass, produce\r\nnegatization to coincident action.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, What condition is it necessary to bring about\r\nin order to bring back normality, or to produce stable equilibrium\r\nin the sympathetic centres?\r\n\r\nThe normal brain is like a harp of many strings strung to perfect\r\nharmony. The transmitting conditions being perfect, are ready, at\r\nany impulse, to induce pure sympathetic assimilation. The different\r\nstrings represent the different ventricles and convolutions. The\r\ndifferentiations of any one from its true setting is fatal, to a\r\ncertain degree, to the harmony of the whole combination.\r\n\r\nIf the sympathetic condition of any physical organism carries a\r\npositive flow of 80 per cent. on its whole combination, and a negative\r\none of 20 per cent., it is the medium of perfect assimilation to one\r\nof the same ratio, if it is distributed under the same conditions to\r\nthe mass of the other. If two masses of metal, of any shape whatever,\r\nare brought under perfect assimilation, to one another, their unition,\r\nwhen brought into contact, will be instant. If we live in a sympathetic\r\nfield we become sympathetic, and a tendency from the abnormal to the\r\nnormal presents itself by an evolution of a purely sympathetic flow\r\ntowards its attractive centres. It is only under these conditions that\r\ndifferentiation can be broken up, and a pure equation established. The\r\nonly condition under which equation can never be established is\r\nwhen a differential disaster has taken place, of 66 2/3 against the\r\n100 pure, taking the full volume as one. If this 66 2/3 or even 100\r\nexists in one organ alone, and the surrounding ones are normal, then\r\na condition can be easily brought about to establish the concordant\r\nharmony or equation to that organ. It is as rare to find a negative\r\ncondition of 66 2/3 against the volume of the whole cerebral mass, as\r\nit is to find a coincident between differentiation; or, more plainly,\r\nbetween two individuals under a state of negative influence. Under\r\nthis new system, it is as possible to induce negations alike as it\r\nis to induce positives alike.\r\n\r\nPure sympathetic concordants are as antagonistic to negative\r\ndiscordants as the negative is to the positive; but the vast volume\r\nthe sympathetic holds over the non-sympathetic, in ethereal space,\r\nmakes it at once the ruling medium and re-adjuster of all opposing\r\nconditions if properly brought to bear upon them.\r\n\r\nUntil Keely's \"Theoretical Exposé\" is given to science, there are\r\nfew who will fathom the full meaning of these views.\r\n\r\nHis discoveries embrace the manner or way of obtaining the keynote,\r\nor \"chord of mass,\" of mineral, vegetable, and animal substances;\r\ntherefore, the construction of instruments, or machines, by which\r\nthis law can be utilized in mechanics, in arts, and in restoration of\r\nequilibrium in disease, is only a question of the full understanding\r\nof the operation of this law.\r\n\r\nKeely estimates that, after the introductory impulse is given on the\r\nharmonic thirds, molecular vibration is increased from 20,000 per\r\nsecond to 100,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the enharmonic sixths, that the vibration of the inter-molecule\r\nis increased to 300,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the diatonic ninths, that atomic vibration reaches 900,000,000; on\r\nthe dominant etheric sixths, 8,100,000,000; and on the inter-etheric\r\nninths, 24,300,000,000; all of which can be demonstrated by sound\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nIn such fields of research, Mr. Keely finds little leisure. Those who\r\naccuse him of \"dilly-dallying,\" of idleness, of \"always going to do\r\nand never doing,\" of \"visionary plans,\" etc., etc., know nothing of\r\nthe infinite patience, the persistent energy, which for a quarter of\r\na century has upheld him in his struggle to attain this end. Still\r\nless, if possible, is he understood by those who think he is seeking\r\nself-aggrandizement, fame, fortune, or glory.\r\n\r\nThe time is approaching when all who have sought to defame this\r\ndiscoverer and inventor, all who have stabbed him with unmerited\r\naccusations, all who have denounced him as \"a bogus inventor,\"\r\n\"a fraud,\" \"an impostor,\" \"a charlatan,\" \"a modern Cagliostro,\"\r\nwill be forced to acknowledge that he has done a giant's work for\r\ntrue science, even though he should not live to attain commercial\r\nsuccess. But history will not forget that, in the nineteenth century,\r\nthe story of Prometheus has been repeated, and that the greatest mind\r\nof the age, seeking to scale the heavens to bring down the light of\r\ntruth for mankind, met with Prometheus's reward.\r\n\r\nNote.--Dr. Hartmann, in a report, or condensed statement, in reference\r\nto Keely's discovery, writes as follows: \"He will never invent a\r\nmachine by which the equilibrium of the living forces in a disordered\r\nbrain can be restored.\"\r\n\r\nAs such a statement would lead the reader of the report to fancy\r\nthat Keely expected to invent such an instrument, it is better to\r\ncorrect the error that Dr. Hartmann has fallen into. Keely has never\r\ndreamed of inventing such an instrument. He hopes, however, to perfect\r\none that he is now at work upon, which will enable the operator to\r\nlocalize the seat of disturbance in the brain in mental disorders. If\r\nhe succeeds, this will greatly simplify the work of \"re-adjusting\r\nopposing conditions\"; and will also enable the physician to decide\r\nwhether the \"differential disaster\" has taken place which prevents the\r\npossibility of establishing the equation that is necessary to a cure.\r\n\r\nAccording to Keely's theories it is that form of energy known as\r\nmagnetism--not electricity--which is to be the curative agent of\r\nthe future, thus reviving a mode of treatment handed down from the\r\ntime of the earliest records, and made known to the Royal Society\r\nof London more than fifty years since by Professor Keil, of Jena,\r\nwho demonstrated the susceptibility of the nervous system to the\r\ninfluence of the natural magnet, and its efficacy in the cure of\r\ncertain infirmities.\r\n\r\nAs Cheston Morris, M.D., has well said in his paper on \"Vital Molecular\r\nVibrations,\" \"We are entering upon a new field in biology, pathology,\r\nand of course, therapeutics, whose limits are at present far beyond\r\nour ken.\"\r\n\r\n\"The adaptability of drugs,\" says Dr. Henry Wood, \"to heal disease\r\nis becoming a matter of doubt, even among many who have not yet\r\nstudied deeper causation. Materia Medica lacks the exact elements of\r\na science. The just preponderance, for good or ill, of any drug upon\r\nthe human system is an unsolved problem, and will so remain.... After\r\ncenturies of professional research, in order to perfect \"the art\r\nof healing,\" diseases have steadily grown more subtle and more\r\nnumerous.... Only when internal, divine forces come to be relied upon,\r\nrather than outside reinforcement, will deterioration cease. Said\r\nPlato, 'You ought not to attempt to cure the body without the soul.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nHELPERS ON THE ROAD, AND HINDERERS.\r\n\r\n                            Blindfolded and alone we stand,\r\n                            With unknown thresholds on each hand:\r\n                            The darkness deepens as we grope,\r\n                            Afraid to fear, afraid to hope.\r\n                            Yet this one thing we learn to know\r\n                            Each day more surely as we go:\r\n                            That doors are opened, ways are made,\r\n                            Burdens are lifted, or are laid\r\n                            By some great law unseen and still\r\n                            Unfathomed purpose to fulfil.\r\n                                          \"Not as I will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next \"helper on the road\" was an Austrian nobleman, the Chevalier\r\nGriez de Ronse, who printed a series of papers on Keely's discoveries\r\nin a journal in Vienna, then owned by him--The Vienna Weekly News. One\r\nof these articles mentions that the attention of Englishmen of science\r\nhad been drawn to Keely's claims, in regard to having imprisoned the\r\nether, by Professor Henri Hertz's experiments in ether vibrations\r\nat the Bonn University. \"Keely, like the late Dr. Schuster,\" says\r\nThe Vienna Weekly News, \"claims on behalf of science the right to\r\nprosecute its investigations until a mechanical explanation of all\r\nthings is attained. The public are still but the children of those\r\nwho murdered Socrates, tolerated the persecution of Galileo, and\r\ndeserted Columbus. This remark is now illustrated by the imprisonment\r\nwith felons last month of Inventor Keely in Moyamensing Prison,\r\nPhiladelphia, where Judge Finletter committed him for contempt of\r\ncourt, without the shadow of an excuse in the opinions of men who\r\nhad followed the proceedings against him.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading, \"Keely's Sunday in Jail,\" says a Philadelphia\r\njournal, Inventor Keely spent a quiet Sunday in Moyamensing Prison. The\r\noutside iron doors of his cell were thrown open, when the religious\r\nservices of the morning began. The imprisoned inventor listened with\r\ndeep interest. The soft peals of the organ and the melody of the choir,\r\nsinging \"Nearer, my God, to Thee,\" floated into the narrow cell. Keely\r\nsat near the grated door while the minister read selections from the\r\nScriptures and preached his sermon. While the inventor was resting\r\nin his cell, during the afternoon, a number of persons made inquiries\r\nat the \"Untried Department.\" They were all told that no one could be\r\nadmitted on Sunday, but a young man with a pallid face lingered. He\r\ntold the gate-keeper that he was an inventor himself, and had been\r\nwaiting for eight years for a patent from Washington; adding that,\r\nwhen he read of Keely's commitment, he was reminded of Galileo who\r\nwas thrown in a dungeon because he said, \"The world moves.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day Keely was released by order of the Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court. His imprisonment exalted him, instead of degrading\r\nhim as \"the unjust judge\" hoped to do; drawing the sympathies to him\r\nof all men who know what it is to be \"persecuted for righteousness'\r\nsake;\" of all men, in all parts of the world, who are truth-loving,\r\njustice-loving men.\r\n\r\nThe Keely Motor Company should learn a lesson in this\r\nexperience. Tyndall said, long since, that the community that severs\r\nitself from great discoveries, that merely runs after the practical\r\napplication without reference to the sources of a discovery, would\r\nby-and-by find itself at the end of its tether. This has been verified\r\nin the fate of the Keely Motor Company, which was organized for the\r\npurpose of reaping financial benefit from Keely's grand discovery\r\nof an unknown force before his \"work of evolution,\" in obtaining\r\nmechanical results, had fairly commenced. This company has thrown\r\nupon the discoverer's shoulders the burden of its stock-jobbing\r\noperations, until Keely is looked upon by men of science, as well\r\nas by men ignorant of the A B C of science, as a man working for\r\npersonal ends; instead of, as he should be regarded, a Prometheus\r\nseeking to give to his fellow-men a costless motive force; and who,\r\nwhether he succeeds financially or not, is entitled to the admiration\r\nof all who believe, with Browning, that \"effort, not success, makes\r\nman great.\" If the Keely Motor Company managers would profit by this\r\nlesson, they will in future seek to find, among scientific men of\r\nworld-wide renown, some one man, broad enough in mind to care nothing\r\nfor the ridicule of the ignorant, who will investigate the nature of\r\nKeely's discoveries, as demonstrated by his experiments, instead of\r\ninviting reporters to witness the demonstrations, in their efforts\r\n\"to boom the stock\" of their company, by a reporter's accounts of\r\nthe marvels he has witnessed. For years Keely had nothing to show,\r\nbeyond the generation of the force, the production of a 30 lb. vacuum\r\nand the discharge of a gun. When once his giant mind had grasped\r\nthe knowledge, which again by seeming chance was imparted to him,\r\nhe made colossal strides across that unknown tract, the boundaries\r\nof which others are now but beginning to explore. Colonel Le Mat was\r\nno false prophet, Le Figaro was no untrustworthy herald, when the\r\nannouncement was made by this French inventor to Monsieur Chevreul,\r\nand by this French journal to the public on the 1st day of September,\r\n1888, that the chain which holds the aerial ship to the earth would\r\nbe broken asunder by Keely's discovery. The nineteenth century holds\r\nin its strong arms the pledge, that sooner or later the aerial navy,\r\nso long waited for, will traverse the trackless high roads of space\r\nfrom Continent to Continent.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by many, Dr. Franz Hartmann among the number,\r\nthat it requires Keely himself, or another person constituted like\r\nhim, to set his machinery in motion. Therefore, it has been reasoned\r\nthat the commercial success of an engine is only possible in case\r\nKeely is himself the engineer; or if another man possessing the same\r\nseemingly abnormal power could be the engineer. For this reason,\r\nsays Dr. Hartmann, it is impossible for Keely to instruct any one in\r\nhis method, so as to enable that one to do what he does. There has\r\nbeen ground in the past for such a statement, it is true, but not\r\nnow. Keely asserts that when his system is completed, the knowledge\r\nof all that is needed for its commercial employment will be more\r\neasily acquired than is the necessary skill demanded to enable one\r\nto safely operate a steam-engine. When Dr. Hartmann's opinion was\r\nmade known to Keely, he replied, \"Dr. Hartmann's whole conception,\r\nin regard to other men being unable to control the operations of my\r\ninventions on the sympathetic attractive system, is as incorrect as\r\nwould be the same conception in reference to operating an electric\r\nbattery by anyone but its inventor.\"\r\n\r\nLet anyone imagine the years on years of research that would have been\r\nnecessary before Gilbert (who, after Thales, discovered electricity)\r\ncould have perfected a system which would have enabled men to\r\naccomplish all that is accomplished in our age, with electricity as\r\na motive power. Keely's labours would be better understood by those\r\nwho accuse him of \"always promising, and never performing,\" under\r\nsuch a conception. The inventor must be sanguine of success; he must\r\nday by day think that he is on the eve of perfecting his invention,\r\nin order to keep up his courage to persevere to the end; otherwise,\r\nhow could he work, year after year, in the face of obstacle after\r\nobstacle that seems, each one, to be insurmountable? After Keely's\r\nimprisonment when, among the men who knew that he was incapable of\r\nfraud, there was one so incensed by Keely's repeated failures to\r\nperfect his engine that he had said he \"hoped to live to see Keely\r\nrotting in a gutter,\" Mr. R. Harte wrote: \"And now that it has been\r\nproved in a hundred ways and before thousands of persons competent to\r\njudge of the merits of Keely's claims, that he has really discovered\r\npreviously unknown forces in nature, studied them, mastered some of\r\ntheir laws, invented and is perfecting researching apparatus that will\r\nmake his discoveries of practical application in numerous ways--now\r\nthat he has actually done this, how does the world treat him? Does\r\nCongress come forward with a grant to enable him to complete his\r\nmarvellous work? Do men of science hail him as a great discoverer,\r\nor hold out the hand of fellowship? Do people do honour to the man\r\nwhose sole entreaty to them will be to receive from his hands a\r\ngift a thousand times more precious to them than steam engine or\r\ndynamo? It is a literal fact that if Keely fell exhausted to-day,\r\nin the terrible struggle he has so long maintained, his failure to\r\nestablish his claims would be received with a shout of malignant\r\ndelight from nearly every lecture-hall, pulpit, counting-house and\r\nnewspaper office in the so-called civilized world. The world has hardly\r\never recognized its benefactors until it has become time to raise a\r\nstatue to their memory, 'in order to beautify the town.' Jealousy,\r\nstupidity, the malignity which is born of conscious inferiority, are\r\nat this moment putting in Keely's road every impediment which law and\r\ninjustice can manufacture. Two hundred years ago he would have been\r\nburned, a century since he would have probably been mobbed to death;\r\nbut thank God we are too civilized, too humane now to burn or mob\r\nto death those who make great discoveries, who wish to benefit their\r\nfellow-men, or whose ideas are in advance of their age--we only break\r\ntheir hearts with slander, ridicule, and neglect, and when that fails\r\nto drive them to suicide, we bring to bear upon them the ponderous\r\npressure of the law, and heap upon them the 'peine forte et dure' of\r\ninjunctions, and orders, and suits, to crush them out of a world they\r\nhave had the impertinence to try to improve, and the folly to imagine\r\nthey could save from suffering, without paying in their own persons\r\nthe inevitable penalty. Had it not been for the obligations incurred by\r\nKeely, in accepting the aid of the Keely Motor Company--in other words,\r\nhad scientists, instead of speculators, furnished him with the means\r\nnecessary to carry on his work of evolution, the secrets which he has\r\nso carefully guarded would now have been public property, so little\r\ndoes he care personally for financial results. As it is, those who\r\nhave witnessed his beautiful experiments in acoustics and sympathetic\r\nvibration were often too ignorant to comprehend their meaning, and,\r\nconsequently, even after expressing gratification to him, went away\r\nfrom his workshop to denounce him as a Cagliostro; while others,\r\ncompetent to judge, have refused to witness the production of the\r\nether, as Sir William Thomson and Lord Raleigh refused, when they were\r\nin America a few years since. The company here mentioned has been a\r\nthorn in the inventor's side ever since it was organized. It has been\r\n'bulled and beared' by greedy speculators, in whose varying interests\r\nthe American newspapers for years have been worked, the results of\r\nwhich the inventor has had to bear. For many years the Company has\r\ncontributed nothing towards Keely's expenses or support, and in the\r\nopinion of many lawyers it is virtually dead. How far it is entitled\r\nto his gratitude may be gathered from the fact, as stated, that 'when\r\nMr. Keely abandoned his old generator of etheric force, baffled in\r\nhis attempts to wrest from nature one of her most carefully guarded\r\nsecrets, harassed by his connection with the Keely Motor Company,\r\nsome of the officers and stockholders of which had instituted law\r\nproceedings against him, which threatened him with the indignity\r\nof imprisonment, he destroyed many of his marvellous models, and\r\ndetermined that, if taken to prison, it should be his dead body and\r\nnot himself.\r\n\r\n\"Those who argue, if Keely had really obtained knowledge which\r\ncontributes towards making man master of the material world, that\r\nscience would hail the glad tidings with great joy, know but little\r\nof modern science and its votaries. An Anglican bishop never ignored\r\na dissenting preacher with more dignified grace than the professor\r\nof orthodox science ignores the heterodox genius who has the audacity\r\nto wander beyond the limitations which 'received opinion' has placed\r\nupon the possibilities of nature. The fact is that men of science have\r\npersistently ignored, and know absolutely nothing about, the great\r\ndepartment of nature into which Keely penetrated years ago, and in\r\nwhich he has now made himself at home. Not long ago a Fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh, Major Ricarde-Seaver, went to Philadelphia\r\nto convince himself as to the nature of Keely's discovery. He returned,\r\nsaying that Keely was working with, and had the apparent command over\r\nforces, the nature, or even the very existence, of which was absolutely\r\nunknown to him, and, so far as he is aware, to modern science.\r\n\r\n\"Beyond disintegration lies dispersion, and Keely can just as easily\r\ndisperse the atoms of matter as disintegrate its molecules. Disperse\r\nthem into what? Well,--into ether, apparently; into the hypothetical\r\nsubstratum which modern scientists have postulated, and about whose\r\nnature they know absolutely nothing but what they invent themselves,\r\nbut which to Keely is not hypothesis, but a fact as real as his own\r\nshoes; and which ether, indeed, seems to be 'the protoplasm of all\r\nthings.' As to the 'law of gravity,' it appears in the light of\r\nKeely's experiments, but one manifestation of a law of very much\r\nwider application--a law which provides for the reversion of the\r\nprocess of attraction in the shape of a process of repulsion.\r\n\r\n\"While Major Ricarde-Seaver, F.R.S., [6] was in Philadelphia, Keely, by\r\nmeans of a belt and certain appliances which he wore upon his person,\r\nmoved single-handed, a 500 horse-power vibratory engine from one\r\npart of his shop to another. There was not a scratch on the floor,\r\nand astounded engineers declared that they could not have moved\r\nit without a derrick, the operation of which would have required\r\nthe removal of the roof of the shop. Of course it is but a step in\r\nadvance of this to construct a machine which, when polarized with a\r\n'negative attraction,' will rise from the earth and move under the\r\ninfluence of an etheric current at the rate of 500 miles an hour,\r\nin any given direction. This is, in fact, Keely's 'air ship.'\r\n\r\n\"When the history of his discoveries and inventions come to be written\r\nthere will be no more pathetic story in the annals of genius than that\r\nof John Worrell Keely. The world hereafter will find it hard to believe\r\nthat in the last quarter of the 19th century a man with an insight\r\ninto the secret workings of nature, and a knowledge of her subtler\r\nforces, which, whenever it is utilized, will relieve mankind from\r\nmuch of the grinding toil that now makes bitter the existence of the\r\nvast majority, that such a man should have been left unaided, because\r\nin all the ranks of science there was not found one man capable of\r\nunderstanding his colossal work--because in all the ranks of religion\r\nthere was not found one man able to realize the enlarged conception of\r\nDeity immanent in Keely's great thoughts--because in all the ranks of\r\ncommerce, of speculation, of literature, of art, there was not found\r\none man large enough, generous enough, unselfish enough, to furnish\r\nmoney for a purpose that did not promise an immediate dividend.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in 1888, more than ever was Keely held up to ridicule by all\r\nthose men who possess the instinct of the brute to hound down its\r\nprey, and his supporters came in for their share of abuse. Among\r\nthis class, or of it, were men so ignorant of Keely's claims,\r\nand of the object of his researches, that they represented him as\r\n\"a seeker of the impossible,\" a \"perpetual motion crank,\" throwing\r\nupon his character other odium which the speculating managers of\r\n\"The Keely Motor Company\" were justly responsible for. One of these\r\ncommunications alone is enough to show the quality of the weapons\r\nused against him. It appeared in The New York Daily Tribune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KEELY MOTOR CRAZE.\r\n\r\nA Donkey-Cabbage Race.\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH LONGER WILL THE CLEVER JUGGLER BE ABLE TO DELUDE HIS VICTIMS?\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of \"The Tribune.\"\r\n\r\nSir,--The success with which Keely has deluded his victims by\r\nappealing to their credulity with a mystery, and to their cupidity\r\nwith a promise of \"all the kingdoms of the earth,\" which would not be\r\nof greater value than the monopoly of infinite power without cost,\r\nwhich he dangles before their astonished vision, makes him and his\r\nantics subjects of unusual interest. His last performance appears to be\r\nan issue of 5,000,000 dols. of new stock representing a new discovery\r\nveiled in mystery, which is to far outstrip his former one, on which\r\n5,000,000 dols. of stock was issued and is now held by his dupes. Two\r\nof these new millions are to go to the old holders as a compensation\r\nto them for their disappointment in not realizing perpetual motion\r\nunder the old discovery; two more to go to Keely to be sold to the\r\npublic; and the remaining one million is in the treasury to be sold\r\nfor the benefit of Keely and the others, half and half.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years the donkey has been ridden by Keely with the cabbage\r\non a pole held just in front of his hungry mouth, and now the donkey\r\nis told that the cabbage after all is only sham, but that the new\r\ncabbage is real, and if he will only consent to run fast enough and\r\nfar enough he certainly will reach it and grow fat.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the donkey ought to pause and consider before he\r\nbegins another fifteen-year race after perpetual motion, and it is here\r\nproposed to assist him in his reflections by a few facts. More than\r\nfifteen years ago Keely made himself known to the public by exhibiting\r\nan apparatus in which a great pressure was manifested, which, he said,\r\nresulted from the discovery by him of a new force the nature of which\r\nwas his secret. Several people, as usual, were astonished at the show,\r\nand bought and paid for shares in the patent which was promised. To\r\ngive colour to the pretence, Keely applied for a patent before 1876,\r\nbut did not assign to the purchasers their shares; whereupon some of\r\nthem protested against the issue of the patent unless their shares\r\nwere recognized in the grant. The Patent Office replied to these\r\nprotests that it could not recognize the rights claimed unless there\r\nwas a written assignment filed in the office, which the claimants did\r\nnot have. The Commissioner, however, called upon Keely to furnish a\r\n\"working model\" of his invention, which, of course, he could not do,\r\nand his application was rejected. The specification and drawings of\r\nthis apparatus show a very silly form of the common perpetual motion\r\nmachine, of which there are thousands. It was open to the public for\r\nsome years, when, under a new rule of the office, it, along with all\r\nother rejected applications, was withdrawn from inspection; but it is\r\nin the office, together with the protests of those who had paid Keely\r\nfor a share in it. I examined it years ago, and informed Mr. Lamson,\r\nand others of Keely's stockholders, of it. Mr. Lamson told me that he\r\nhad charged Keely with deception, because he had always said that he\r\nnever had applied for a patent, and that Keely explained it by saying\r\nthat he had purposely concealed his invention from the Patent Office\r\nin that application to which he had made oath.\r\n\r\nKeely, however, finding the perpetual motion trick profitable,\r\nextended his operations and became well known to many influential\r\npeople by his exhibitions. In the winter of 1875-76 he produced two\r\nmetallic spheres, one about thirty inches in diameter, hung like\r\nan ordinary terrestrial globe, which, he said, would revolve with\r\na force equal to two horse-power, and would continue to run when\r\nonce started as long as the Centennial Exhibition should be open,\r\nand until the thing was worn out by friction. In starting it Keely\r\nused to have a blackboard in the room, on which he would write a few\r\nfigures in chalk in the presence of his dupes, and would say that at\r\na certain time the globe would start--and it did, and would revolve\r\nas long as the lookers-on remained to see it. Keely pretended to\r\nexplain this phenomenon by a string of unintelligible jargon; but the\r\npoint of it all was that he said the thing ran in consequence of its\r\ninternal mechanical arrangement--or, in other words, that by combining\r\npieces of metal in a certain way power was generated without any other\r\nexpense than that required to construct the apparatus. Naturally he\r\nrefused to show the interior construction which did the miracle;\r\nbut if his statements were true, it existed inside of that globe,\r\nand could be produced indefinitely with the result of producing an\r\nindefinite amount of horse-power without current expense.\r\n\r\nThe stock about this time rose to a great price--about 600 per\r\ncent.--as it well might if this ball was an \"honest ghost.\" Some of\r\nthe stockholders had sense enough to see that if Keely's story were\r\ntrue, nothing more could be desired, for it must at once supersede\r\ncoal and all other means of producing power, and its novelty could\r\nnot be doubted. It was in effect, \"all the kingdoms of the earth,\"\r\nwhich Satan once offered. But, on the other hand, if Keely's story\r\nwere not true, then he was simply an impostor who had been defrauding\r\nthe stockholders out of their money; and they demanded of Keely\r\nthat he should proceed at once to patent this miraculous machine,\r\nwhich could create power by a peculiar-shaped hole in a sphere of\r\niron. Of course Keely refused to comply with this reasonable request,\r\nand many of his stockholders sold out and left him; since which time\r\nthe stock has gradually declined down to the present time, when its\r\nvalue is admitted to be nothing.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts the curious question is why the donkey goes\r\non any further. The revolving ball is a fact known to hundreds of\r\nthe stockholders. It is either a real cabbage capable of feeding\r\nthe donkey with a perpetual feast, like the widow's cruse of oil,\r\nor it is only a sham such as any good mechanic could construct\r\nand operate as Keely did. Why doesn't the donkey balk and insist on\r\nbiting into the cabbage? If it is real the Keely stock is worth untold\r\nmillions. It would put an end to steam engines and electric batteries\r\nfor ever. One of those balls in the corner of a room would make all\r\nthe heat and light which could be used, and have power to sell; and\r\nall that would be needed would be to learn Keely's cabalistic signs\r\non the blackboard in order to make it start, and to stop it when it\r\nhad done enough. But if the ball is only a trick, then, of course,\r\nKeely could be sent to prison, and his victims could close their\r\naccounts and be sure that they would lose no more by him.\r\n\r\nWithout going any further into the history of this remarkable delusion,\r\nwhich is full of similar tricks too numerous to mention now, it seems\r\nclear that these facts ought to be used to bring to an end in one\r\nway or the other the Keely craze.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward N. Dickerson.\r\n\r\nNew York, Nov. 30, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how anyone could concoct and put together\r\nsuch a tissue of fabrications as this, when the sole foundation for\r\nsuch a tissue lay in the fact that it was at this juncture that Keely\r\nmade the announcement that he had proved the uselessness of building\r\nengines to employ the ether as a motive power; which could only be\r\nused as the medium for the power which he had discovered, namely,\r\na condition of sympathetic vibration, associated both positively and\r\nnegatively with the polar stream.\r\n\r\nThe statement made of the issue of new stock is absolutely untrue. The\r\nrevolving globe was never created to be \"the source of power,\" and the\r\nrepresentation of the manner in which the globe was made to revolve,\r\nand that Keely affirmed he could produce with it \"an indefinite\r\namount of horse power without current expense,\" is denied. The\r\nsuggestion that Keely could be sent to prison was welcomed by those\r\nwho eventually acted upon it, with the result that Judge Finletter\r\ncommitted Keely to Moyamensing Prison, for contempt of court, but\r\nnot for fraud. Mr. Keely, at that time, wrote of those who called\r\nhim a perpetual motion seeker:--\"I console myself by thinking that\r\nif they were not ignorant of the grand truths which I am devoting my\r\nlife to develop into a system, they could never bring forward such\r\nan absurd charge. Perpetual motion is against nature, and it is only\r\nby following nature's laws that I can ever hope to reach the goal I\r\nam aiming to reach.\"\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court reversed and set aside the order of the court\r\ncommitting Keely for contempt, and released him from custody, upon\r\nthe writ of habeas corpus taken out on his behalf, within three days\r\nof his commitment.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice, in delivering his opinion, made some remarks\r\nwhich fully vindicated Mr. Keely's character. After alluding to the\r\nproper procedure which ought to have been taken in the court below,\r\nthe Judge continued:--\r\n\r\n\"Instead of so proceeding, a commission of experts was appointed to\r\nexamine the defendant's machine, and the order of April 7th was made,\r\nby which the defendant, in advance of any issue, was not only required\r\nto exhibit his machine, but also to operate it and explain the mode\r\nof its construction and operation, although it clearly appeared that\r\nit would require considerable expense to clean the machine, put it\r\ntogether and operate it. The defendant appears to have been willing\r\nto exhibit it, and in point of fact did so. That he might have been\r\ncompelled to do so at a proper stage of the case is conceded. But\r\nto make an order not only to exhibit it, but to operate it, the\r\npractical effect of which was to wring from him his defence in advance\r\nof any issue joined, was an improvident and excessive exercise of\r\nChancery powers. We are of opinion that the order was improvidently\r\nmade. It follows that the learned court had no power to enforce it\r\nby attachment. The relator is discharged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in this year, 1888, that a woman, interested in all branches of\r\nscience, who had proved to her own satisfaction the value to humanity,\r\nas well as to science, of Keely's discoveries, was deprived of legal\r\nand maternal rights on account of the delusions that she was very\r\ngenerally believed to be under. A journalist, wishing to obtain\r\ninformation concerning Keely's work, called upon this woman, by\r\nappointment, and at the close of the interview said,--\r\n\r\n\"May I venture to ask you if it is true that you have furnished\r\nMr. Keely with large sums of money as rumour declares; and that you\r\nhave invested largely in the stock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I not glad of the opportunity to answer this question in justice\r\nto Mr. Keely, I might have said that this is a subject which is of\r\nno interest to the public; but I have heard the amount estimated as\r\nnearly 100,000l. too often not to be willing to have the truth made\r\nknown. What I have given to Mr. Keely has been saved by economies\r\nin my expenses; and, if not given to him, would have been given to\r\nothers; as I believe in those who have the most doing all that lies\r\nin their power for those who have less. In regard to investments in\r\nKeely Motor stock, I have bought no stock excepting to give away.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one other question I should like to ask you,\" said our\r\nrepresentative, \"Is Mr. Keely a spiritualist? I use the word in its\r\nordinary sense. Does he claim that he has bridged the gulf between\r\nthe finite and the infinite?\"\r\n\r\n\"When Mr. Keely first commenced his wonderful investigations he would\r\nhave scouted the idea of being in any way whatever associated with\r\nso-called spiritualism, but of recent years, and especially during\r\nthe last few months, he has made such startling progress that he now\r\nadmits--as I told him a long time ago he would come to admit--that\r\nif not in actual experiment, at least in theory he has passed into\r\nthe world of spirit.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview being ended, our representative took his departure, after\r\nexpressing his thanks for the information so willingly given. How far\r\nthis lady's anticipations of the inventor's success will be realized,\r\nor how far her confidence in his integrity is justified, we must leave\r\nour readers to judge for themselves. The whole subject is enveloped in\r\nmuch mystery, but it is full of interest, and if half that is narrated\r\nof Mr. Keely be true, he is indeed a wonderful man!--The Tatler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1889-1890.\r\n\r\nKEELY SUPPORTED BY DISTINGUISHED MEN OF SCIENCE. AERIAL NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n        Is not ether infinitely more rare and more subtle than air,\r\n        and exceedingly more elastic and more active? Does it not\r\n        easily penetrate all bodies? And is it not by its elastic\r\n        force diffused through the universe?--Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1889 a series of short articles were written, which, for the\r\nfirst time, made known to the public that Keely had theories which\r\nhe was able to sustain by mechanical demonstration: and once more\r\nan attempt was made to have men of science acquaint themselves with\r\nthe theories, and witness the demonstrations. Capitalists also\r\nwere appealed to, to convince themselves of the existence of an\r\nunknown force, and of Mr. Keely's honesty in his efforts to control\r\nit for commercial purposes; money being required to enable him to\r\ncomplete his researches for science, and to protect him from those\r\nwho were harassing him in such a way as to impede his progress at\r\nevery step. The appeal to capitalists might as well have been made\r\nto stone walls; but among the men of scientific and philosophical\r\nattainments who were invited, the late Professor Joseph Leidy, M.D.,\r\nof the Pennsylvania University, and James M. Willcox, Ph.D., author\r\nof \"Rational Philosophy,\" and other works, accepted the invitation\r\nand attended a series of Keely's researching experiments. For years\r\nMr. Keely's experiments were confined to the production of the force;\r\nthe raising of a lever; the firing of a cannon; and the showing of a\r\nvacuum greater than had ever been produced. Since 1888 he has pursued\r\nhis researches on a line which enabled him to show uninterrupted\r\nprogress year after year: so that now he never repeats his experiments;\r\nbut, discarding or improving his researching instruments, after he has\r\ngained the results which his theories lead him to expect, he continues\r\nhis investigations, thereafter, from the solid basis which he has\r\nattained by those researches. The result of the attention given by\r\nProfessor Leidy and Dr. Willcox is best set down in their own words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"April 8th, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"After having had the opportunity of witnessing a series of experiments\r\nmade by Mr. John Keely, illustrative of a reputed new motor power,\r\nit has appeared to me that he has fairly demonstrated the discovery\r\nof a force previously unknown to science. I have no theory to account\r\nfor the phenomena observed, but I believe Mr. Keely to be honest in\r\nhis attempt to explain them. His demonstrations appear to indicate\r\ngreat mechanical power, which, when applied to appropriate machinery,\r\nmust supersede all ordinary appliances.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph Leidy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Philadelphia, April 8th, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"After having witnessed, on several occasions and under favourable\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Keely's experiments in what he terms sympathetic\r\nvibration, I am satisfied that he has made new and important\r\ndemonstrations in physical science. He has made manifest the existence\r\nof natural forces that cannot be explained by any known physical laws,\r\nand has shown that he possesses over them a very considerable control.\r\n\r\n\"James M. Willcox.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after these announcements were made public, with the consent\r\nof the writers, Anglo-Austria contained two papers on the subject,\r\nfrom which, principally, the article on Etheric Philosophy is taken.\r\n\r\nS. Zolver Preston, in his \"Physics of the Ether,\" says: \"A quantity\r\nof matter representing a total mass of only one grain, and possessing\r\nthe normal velocity of the ether particles, that of a wave of light,\r\nencloses a state of energy represented by upward of one thousand\r\nmillions of foot tons. Or the mass of one single grain contains an\r\nenergy not less than that possessed by a mass of 70,000 tons, moving\r\nat the speed of a cannon ball (1200 feet per second); or, otherwise,\r\na quantity of matter, representing a mass of one grain, endued with the\r\nvelocity of the ether particles, encloses an amount of energy which,\r\nif entirely utilized, would be competent to project a weight of 100\r\ntons to a height of one mile and nine-tenths of a mile.\"\r\n\r\nEtheric philosophy has a scientific basis in fact; and in the light\r\nof Keely's progressive demonstrations, his views are no longer\r\nabnormal to the scientific mind which is willing to admit the\r\npossibility of a discovery in which it has had no part. To discover\r\nan unknown power is one thing; to subjugate it is quite another\r\nthing. The one may be stumbled over; the other can only be attained\r\nafter laborious investigation. No one who has followed Keely in his\r\n\"dead work,\" during the last ten years, can doubt that he has been,\r\nand still is, dealing with the same force which, as Professor Hertz\r\nhas disclosed to us, is already imprisoned, without our knowledge,\r\nin electro-magnetic engines. If thus, unknowingly, it has been made\r\nthe servant of man, in machinery not especially constructed for its\r\nuse, may it not also have been imprisoned by one who is adapting his\r\ninventions to its special requirements? Keely demonstrates, with\r\nwhat he calls vibratory machinery, that all corpuscules of matter\r\nmay be subdivided by a certain order of vibration, thus showing up\r\nnew elements; and having demonstrated what he asserts, by releasing\r\nthe various orders of ether from the suspension in which it is always\r\nheld in our atmosphere, he has answered the sceptical demand \"Give us\r\nsome bread.\" It has been said that as men penetrate deeper and deeper\r\ninto a knowledge of the wonderful laws which govern the universe they\r\nmay find mysterious forces which remain still undiscovered. Keely's\r\ndiscoveries promise to burst upon the world of science as the one\r\nmighty and complete revelation of the universe. There are more things\r\nin heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the materialistic science\r\nof our age, or in our philosophy. \"All we have cognizance of around\r\nus are results, the causes of which are supersensuous. Of the nature\r\nwhich we behold around us, the cause is supernatural.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Albert H. Plumb, of Roxbury, Mass., who has followed\r\nMr. Keely's efforts, to obtain control of the unknown force which he\r\ndiscovered more than twenty years ago, up to his present successful\r\ndemonstration before scientists, says: \"Neither theological science\r\nnor any department of physical science, as it lies in the divine\r\nmind, is exactly expressed in any human system; yet no knowledge is\r\nto be decried nor despised, least of all in the highest realms of\r\nthought. The agnostic makes the mistake of confounding exhaustive\r\nknowledge with positive knowledge in declaring both unattainable. We\r\ncan know positively that a thing is, if not how or why it is. As\r\nGladstone says, 'Our hands can lay hold of truths which our arms\r\ncannot embrace. We can apprehend what we cannot comprehend.' If Keely\r\nshould die, I fear no one could understand his writings. Every day we\r\nread of distinguished men dying. The other day a man carried with him\r\ninto the grave his secret for the cheap production of aluminium. No\r\none man entrusted by Providence with high interests has a right\r\nto allow a possibility of their sinking back, perhaps for ages,\r\ninto the void of the unknown. Why not confine attention strictly to\r\nmaking the discovery practically intelligible to others, and thus\r\nsecuring to mankind the first steps by which the new force is evoked\r\nand controlled, and leave to later leisure the subtler relations of\r\nthis power to the divine mind and to life?\"\r\n\r\nFor years Mr. Keely did \"confine attention\" to efforts to prove his\r\ndiscovery by practical methods, without making any advance; and it was\r\nnot until he was led into the spiritual or philosophical bearings of\r\nhis discovery that he himself gained \"practically intelligible\" ideas\r\nof its nature. To Dr. Macvicar's \"Sketch of a Philosophy,\" from which\r\nMrs. Moore compiled \"Ether the True Protoplasm,\" and to Mrs. Hughes'\r\nbook on the evolution of tones and colours, Mr. Keely is indebted for\r\nthe pregnant germs which, falling from their writings upon his mind,\r\ntook him from the line of experiment which he was pursuing, into the\r\nonly line of research which can lead to scientific and commercial\r\nsuccess. The hour in which he reaches one he reaches both; nor can\r\none be gained without the other being gained. This should teach us\r\nthat, though \"the heart of man deviseth his way, the Lord directeth\r\nhis steps.\" God never hurries, and He chooses His own instruments,\r\nemploying them after a manner that is inscrutable to us, in our weak\r\nimpatience for results. Admitting the truth of all that Dr. Plumb\r\nhas said, but understanding fully the impossibility of directing\r\nMr. Keely's steps, until he himself gains more control of the force\r\nthat he has discovered, we must \"wait upon the Lord,\" who is revealing\r\nto him \"the deep mysteries of Creation.\" In the meantime, those in whom\r\nnarrowness of mind has not caused stubbornness will hold themselves\r\nin readiness to prove all things and hold fast to the truth. We do\r\nnot easily believe what is beyond our own knowledge, but faith in the\r\nclaims of Keely as a discoverer, if not as an inventor, is steadily\r\nincreasing. The following from a foreign publication about the Keely\r\nMotor will be of interest to all who have watched the progress of\r\nthat enterprise. The correspondent writes:--\"In the following brief\r\narticle I purpose placing the latest aspect of Mr. Keely, perhaps\r\nthe best abused man in America, and his investigations before the\r\nreaders of Anglo-Austria;\" continuing,--\r\n\r\n\"Under the heading of 'The Keely Motor Again,' Invention, of London,\r\non October 19th, printed a communication, mentioning the leading\r\nscientist of America, Dr. Leidy, of the University of Pennsylvania,\r\nas supporting Mr. Keely's claims as a discoverer of an unknown force,\r\nas follows:--Dr. Leidy having expressed the wish that Professor\r\nBarker should again visit Mr. Keely and witness the experiments\r\nwhich had convinced himself that Keely had discovered a new force,\r\nhas received the following letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"909, Walnut Street, Philadelphia, October 4, 1889.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Leidy. Sir,--Referring to our conversation of a few days since,\r\nand the suggestion of another visit to the workshop of Mr. Keely,\r\nby Professor Barker, I would say that I have presented the matter to\r\nMr. Keely and he acquiesces in what I stated to you. That is to say, if\r\nDr. Barker desires to visit Mr. Keely's workshops again, and will make\r\nthis known to him in writing or through yourself, for the purpose of\r\nfurther observation and of having confirmed or removed from his mind,\r\nas the case may be, the conclusions or impressions arrived at by him,\r\nand published in the columns of the Ledger, of this city, in 1878;\r\nand on condition that he will, if his further observations satisfy\r\nhim that he did injustice to Mr. Keely, forthwith publish that fact\r\nthrough the same channel, the Ledger: he being, of course, at full\r\nliberty to confirm by further publication his previous condemnation,\r\nif satisfied with the correctness of that conclusion; then Dr. Barker\r\nwill be cordially received by Mr. Keely, and a series of experiments\r\nwill be conducted for him at an early day, say, Saturday, 12 inst. And\r\nin the event of the engagement being made, I shall request the pleasure\r\nof your presence, and that of Dr. McCook. I leave the matter in your\r\nhands for such action as you in your wise discretion may think proper\r\nto take. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n\"Charles B. Collier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing could be fairer than Mr. Keely's proposal, and the result of\r\nProfessor Barker's visit will be watched for with the keenest interest\r\nby all scientists on both sides of the Atlantic. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Professor Barker, after due consideration, concluded not to accept\r\nthe invitation, and declined it on October 11th, suggesting Professor\r\nGoodspeed, his associate in physics, as one who would probably be\r\ndisposed to witness the series of experiments about to be given;\r\nshowing the neutralizing or overcoming of gravity and the separation\r\nof metallic plates by vibration. After the date upon which these\r\nlatter experiments were to have been made, and which I may mention,\r\nen passant, had been repeatedly made in the laboratory of Mr. Keely,\r\nthis cablegram was sent from London to Philadelphia:-- 'Ask Dr. Leidy's\r\npermission to announce here his conviction that Keely has discovered\r\na new force.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer was returned as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Having had the opportunity of seeing Mr. John Keely's experiments,\r\nit has appeared to me that he has command of some unknown force of\r\nmost wonderful mechanical power.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph Leidy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nInvention, in commenting upon the communication, says: \"We wish\r\nto make it quite clear that we do not identify ourselves with any\r\nof the opinions which are expressed in this communication. It is\r\ncertainly desirable that the motor should be thoroughly tested, and\r\nparticularly that all the secrecy, which has hitherto been practised\r\nin connection with it, should be abandoned. There can be no reason\r\nwhy this invention, if invention it be, should not be published to the\r\nworld as long as it is fully protected by patents. We agree, however,\r\nso far, that Professor Barker's report, if his visit be paid, will\r\nbe of considerable interest.\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks of our English contemporary are based upon quite\r\nwrong premises. The motor cannot be tested nor patented until it\r\nis completed. Mr. Keely's work is one of experimental research. His\r\nmachine for the production and liberation of the power is in daily\r\noperation. He has made many failures in constructing his commercial\r\nengine, but each failure has brought him nearer to perfection.\r\n\r\nWhen he has succeeded in building an engine in which he can regulate\r\nthe speed, control reversions and govern its operations, as completely\r\nas the steam engine is now governed, then he will be ready to test\r\nits action publicly, take out patents for the same, and make known\r\nto the world the nature of his discovery. Up to the present time\r\nMr. Keely's inventions have been principally devices, enabling him\r\nto experiment with the force which he has discovered and to obtain\r\ncontrol over it. For years he was impeded by the frequency of the\r\nexplosions which took place, breaking his ribs, paralyzing his left\r\nside for six weeks at one time, and frequently bursting iron tubes\r\nas if they were pipe stems.\r\n\r\nLittle by little he learned the laws which governed the unknown force,\r\nand now he never has an explosion. Mr. Keely has not preserved any\r\nsecrecy with regard to his experiments, but on the contrary he has\r\nlost much time in exhibiting the production of this force to those\r\nwho desire to see it. For instance, some years ago he stopped his\r\nwork on the graduating of his engine to take his liberator to pieces,\r\nin order to show its interior construction to Sir William Thompson\r\nand Lord Raleigh: these gentlemen, misled by Professor Barker's\r\nassertion, that Keely was deceiving his dupes with compressed air,\r\nrefused to witness his experiments. This was in 1884.\r\n\r\nThere is no \"secrecy to be abandoned,\" therefore. The question to be\r\nsettled was not one of secrecy, but whether Mr. Keely should continue\r\nhis experimental research, unimpeded by exhibitions, until he should\r\nsucceed in perfecting a commercial engine; or whether he should first\r\nconvince scientists that he is not a modern Cagliostro as he has been\r\ncalled, and that he is a discoverer of an unknown force.\r\n\r\nThe ground taken by those who urged the latter course was that the\r\ninterests of the Keely Motor Company would thus be better served;\r\nreasoning that, when scientists have been convinced that Mr. Keely's\r\nresearches are in a field comparatively unknown to them, the cries\r\nof execration would be drowned in the applause which would resound\r\nthroughout the world as the result of his stupendous labours became\r\nbetter known.\r\n\r\nFor this end several scientists were invited to witness the present\r\nstage of experiment, which Mr. Keely had reached in his efforts to\r\nprovide his provisional engine with a governor, and Dr. Leidy was\r\none of the number who, after witnessing the experiments on May 28th,\r\n1889, confessed himself convinced that Keely was dealing with some\r\nunknown force.\r\n\r\nWhen we call to mind Watt's persevering efforts during thirty years,\r\nbefore he succeeded in his attempt to invent a governor for the steam\r\nengine, we can afford to be more patient with Mr. Keely than we have\r\nbeen. Taking into consideration the marvellous advance which Mr. Keely\r\nhas made in the past five years in perfecting his liberator, we should\r\nnot be surprised to hear at any moment that he has also perfected\r\nhis commercial engine, the so-called \"Keely Motor,\" thus overcoming\r\nhis sole remaining obstacle to financial success. Those who talk of\r\n\"testing\" the motor, or of patenting it in its present condition,\r\nare not aware of the exertions which have been made by Mr. Keely\r\nto bring the motor to its present stage of development; nor that,\r\nalthough the motor now seems to be approaching perfection, the work\r\nof evolution will not be completed until it is in a patentable form.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 James Watt made his first model of a steam carriage. In\r\n1784 he took out a patent. In 1803 the first engine was built, but\r\nit was not until 1824 that the experiment of running a locomotive\r\nfrom Liverpool to Stockport was made. Until Mr. Keely's commercial\r\nengine is perfected and patented, now that scientists are beginning\r\nto support him as the discoverer of an unknown force, ridicule should\r\ngive way to sympathy; for we know that nature never reveals one of\r\nher tyrant forces without at the same time showing how this force is\r\nto be transformed into the slave of man, and that complete success\r\nis only a question of time.--Anglo-Austria, March, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME RECENT EXPERIMENTS. [8]\r\n\r\nCopy of a Letter addressed to Professor Dewar of the Royal Institution\r\nof Great Britain.\r\n\r\nDear Professor Dewar,--As I have already informed you, I carried\r\nout your wishes in reference to Professor Rowland of the John\r\nHopkins University, as far as extending to him an invitation to\r\nwitness some of Mr. Keely's experiments in sympathetic vibration\r\nwas concerned. Professor Rowland was not able to witness any\r\ndemonstration whatever, on account of an accident which happened to the\r\ndisintegrator, and he could not fail to have formed an unfavourable\r\nopinion of Mr. Keely from all that transpired on that occasion. I\r\nnext renewed the invitation to Professor Barker, which had already\r\nbeen extended to him by Professor Leidy, both of these gentlemen\r\nbeing Professors in the Pennsylvania University. Professor Barker\r\nwas not able to be present. The series of experiments which have\r\nbeen given for scientists, mechanical engineers, and others since my\r\nreturn, closed on the 12th. The steady progress from week to week,\r\nsince the accident to the disintegrator was repaired, has given\r\nbeautiful evidence of the wisdom of the plan adopted by Mr. Keely\r\nin the winter of 1888-89, which led him to turn his attention to a\r\nclass of experiments of quite a different nature from those which,\r\nup to that time, had been made for commercial ends; experiments which\r\nhave not failed to convince all who attended the entire series that\r\nMr. Keely is dealing with an unknown force, the laws governing which\r\nhe is still in partial ignorance concerning. He admits now that he\r\ncannot construct a patentable engine to use this force till he has\r\nmastered the principle; and a fund, with the approval of scientists,\r\nhas been appropriated for this end, upon the condition that he will\r\nwaste no more time upon what is known as the Keely Motor Engine\r\nuntil he has demonstrated his ability to control reversions and in\r\nall points to govern the revolutions.\r\n\r\nHis last engine was built to exhibit the practical nature of\r\nhis discovery to capitalists, the managers of \"The Keely Motor\r\nCompany\"--which company died a natural death years since--hoping\r\nthereby to raise the price of its stock, and in this way to furnish\r\nMr. Keely with the funds that he needed. But the exhibition of this\r\nengine was premature and did not succeed. There will be no further\r\nneed for such exhibitions in future, for it is, as it always has been,\r\nin the interest of stock-holders that the stock should not rise until\r\nthe system is completed, when it will rise to remain raised. From\r\nthis time the interests of stock-holders will not be sacrificed to\r\nthe interest of stock-jobbers. The experiments conducted on Saturday\r\nlast surpassed preceding ones in the purity of the demonstrations,\r\nthe instruments being in better condition.\r\n\r\nIn demonstrating what seems to be the overcoming of gravity for aerial\r\nnavigation, Mr. Keely used a model of an air-ship, weighing about eight\r\npounds, which, when the differentiated wire of silver and platinum\r\nwas attached to it, communicating with the sympathetic transmitter,\r\nrose, descended, or remained stationary midway, the motion as gentle\r\nas that of thistledown floating in the air.\r\n\r\nThe experiment illustrating \"chord of mass\" sympathy was repeated,\r\nusing a glass chamber, forty inches in height, filled with water,\r\nstanding on a slab of glass. Three metal spheres, weighing about\r\nsix ounces each, rested on the glass floor of the chamber. The\r\nchord of mass of these spheres was B flat first octave, E flat\r\nsecond octave, and B flat third octave. Upon sounding the note B\r\nflat on the sympathetic transmitter, the sphere having that chord of\r\nmass rose slowly to the top of the chamber; the positive end of the\r\nwire having been attached, which connected the covered jar with the\r\ntransmitter. The same result followed the sound of the note in sympathy\r\nwith the chord of mass of the other spheres, all of which descended\r\nas gently as they rose, upon changing the positive to the negative.\r\n\r\nJ. M. Willcox, Ph.D., who was present, remarked,--\"This experiment\r\nproves the truth of a fundamental law in scholastic philosophy,\r\nviz., that when one body attracts or seeks another body, it is not\r\nthat the effect is the sum of effects produced by parts of one body\r\nupon parts of another, one aggregate of effects, but the result of\r\nthe operation of one whole upon another whole.\"\r\n\r\nThe experiments on the 12th closed with the disintegration of water,\r\ntwelve drops of which we saw dropped, drop by drop, into the small\r\nsphere attached to the disintegrator after exhausting the air\r\nby suction. A pressure of over 20,000 pounds to the square inch\r\nwas shown to the satisfaction of all present, and when Mr. Willcox\r\naccepted Mr. Keely's invitation to take a seat on the arm of the lever,\r\nadding his 260 pounds to the weight, applause broke forth. Mr. Keely\r\nshowed control of the ether, inter-atomic subdivision, by graduating\r\nthe escape of the residue, as he allowed it to discharge itself with\r\na noise like the rushing of steam to an expulsion as gentle as the\r\nbreathings of an infant. The three subdivisions acted simultaneously,\r\nshowing instantaneous association and disassociation. The sympathetic\r\nglobe was operated upon, 120 revolutions a second, ceasing the instant\r\nthat the wire was detached.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that Professor Ira Remsen was prevented, I fear\r\nby Professor Rowland, from witnessing any one of this series of\r\nexperiments as he intended doing; nor have I been able to get the\r\nopinion of any physicist in whom I felt any confidence; but Mr. Keely\r\nis satisfied to have the support of such men as J. M. Willcox, Ph.D.,\r\nand Professor Leidy, LL.D. Dr. Leidy was awarded the Lyell Medal in\r\n1884, when in London, and the Cuvier Prize in 1888, from the Academy\r\nof Sciences in France. He is known in America not only as possessing\r\nthe broadest of minds and the gentlest of natures, but as holding in\r\nhis heart that love for, and reverence of, truth and justice which\r\nalone can confer the power of forming a correct and a just judgment.\r\n\r\nI would like to have you make known in England that Mr. Keely\r\nis indebted to Macvicar's Sketch of a Philosophy for turning his\r\nattention, in 1884, to researches on the structure of ether, and to\r\nMrs. F. J. Hughes (not Mrs. Watts Hughes), for the suggestions in her\r\nwork on Harmonies of Tones and Colours Developed by Evolution, which\r\nled him into the line of experiment that will enable him to show on\r\na disc the various colours of sound, each note having its colour, and\r\nto demonstrate in various ways Mrs. Hughes' own words \"that the same\r\nlaws which develop musical harmonies develop the universe,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June, 1890, the Rev. John Andrew, of Belfast, whose\r\npendulographs illustrate the ratios which rule in the domain of\r\natmospheric vibrations, in which audible music has been located by the\r\ngreat numberer, wrote: \"I think that now, at last, Keely's labours\r\nare about to be honourably recognized by the world of science. May\r\nhe live to rejoice in his triumphs.\" Mr. Andrew, who was the friend\r\nof the late Dr. Macvicar, was instrumental in bringing \"A Sketch\r\nof a Philosophy\" to Mrs. Moore's notice, and has maintained great\r\ninterest in Keely's researches since he first heard of them. Miss\r\nMary Green, a governess in the family of Lord Wimborne, was another\r\ninstrument used to make known to Keely the important nature of the\r\nenergy he had liberated from the suspension in which it is always\r\nheld in our atmosphere. About this time Professor James Dewar, who\r\nhad been following Keely's claims as a discoverer since 1884, wrote:\r\n\"If Mr. Keely succeeds in making his discovery practically useful, as\r\nit is said that he is demonstrating to scientists his ability to do--if\r\nthis information be true, it is strange to contrast the past history of\r\nscience with the present. Fancy the discoverer of electricity having\r\nsucceeded in inventing the modern dynamo machine! Such a fact would\r\nmean the concentration of hundreds of years of scientific discovery\r\nand invention into the single life of one man. Such a result would\r\nbe simply marvellous.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time a number of the leading journals in various parts of\r\nthe United States announced that, although Keely's methods and his\r\nfailures had combined to engender distrust and arouse ridicule,\r\nit could no longer be denied that he had discovered what no other\r\nman has discovered. Still \"penny-a-liners\" continued to employ those\r\n\"weapons of small souls and narrow minds,\" sneers and ridicule and\r\ncalumny, which Lavater's allegorical vignette so well depicts: A hand\r\nholding a lighted torch is stung by a wasp, and the gnats that swarm\r\naround it are consumed in its flame. Underneath are these lines:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        And although it singes the wings of the gnats,\r\n        Destroys their heads and all their little brains,\r\n            Light is still light;\r\n        And although I am stung by the angriest wasp,\r\n            I will not yield.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery defender of the truth, at whom shafts of ridicule are levelled,\r\nshould recall these words. Never, for one moment, has Keely turned\r\naside from his work to answer his assailants.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the magical nature of his\r\ndemonstrations, more inexplicable than any feats of legerdemain, should\r\nhave brought upon him the suspicion of fraudulent representation,\r\nconcerning the production of the force and its manipulation; but his\r\npersistency alone in seeking to unravel the mysteries of nature, ought\r\nto have brought around him sooner men who, like the revered and great\r\nLeidy, were able to appreciate his researches in sympathetic vibration,\r\nthe laws of which govern everything in creation, from the movements of\r\nthe planets, down to the movements of atoms. From the time in which it\r\nwas made known to Keely that the same principle underlies harmonies\r\nand the motion of heavenly bodies, as announced by Pythagoras, his\r\ngrasping intellect conceived the idea that planetary bodies have\r\na nerve-system, subject to conditions which govern it and keep it\r\nunder control, just as our human mechanism is controlled by the law\r\nwhich governs its operation. In Keely's theories all is mechanical in\r\nnature. A molecule of steel, a molecule of gas, a molecule of brain\r\nmatter are all of the one primeval substance--the Ether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAERIAL NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nThe instrument devised by Mr. Keely for bringing the air-ship under\r\ncontrol in its ascent and descent, consists of a row of bars, like\r\nthe keys of a piano, representing the enharmonic and the diatonic\r\nconditions. These bars range from 0 to 100. At 50 Mr. Keely thinks\r\nthe progress of the vessel ought to be about 500 miles an hour. At\r\n100 gravity resumes its control. If pushed to that speed it would\r\ndescend like a rifle-ball to the earth. There is no force known so\r\nsafe to use as the polar flow if, as Mr. Keely thinks, that, when\r\nthe conditions are once set up, they remain for ever, with perpetual\r\nmolecular action as the result, until the machinery wears out. In\r\nthe event of meeting a cyclone, the course of the vessel, he teaches,\r\ncan be guided so as to ascend above the cyclone by simply dampening\r\na certain proportion of these vibratory bars.\r\n\r\nThe instrument for guiding the ship has nothing to do with the\r\npropelling of it, which is a distinct feature of itself, acting by\r\nmolecular bombardment; moving the molecules in the same order as in\r\nthe suspension process, but transversely. After the molecular mass\r\nof the vessel is sensitized, or made concordant with the celestial\r\nand terrestrial streams, the control of it in all particulars is\r\neasy and simple. In ascending the positive force is used, or the\r\ncelestial, as Keely has named it, and in descending the negative\r\nor terrestrial. Passing through a cyclone the air-ship would not be\r\naffected by it.\r\n\r\nThe breaking up of cyclones will open a field for future research,\r\nif any way can be discovered for obtaining the chord of mass of the\r\ncyclone. To differentiate the chord of its thirds would destroy it; but\r\nto those who know nothing of the underlying principle, on which Keely\r\nhas based his system, all such assertions are the merest \"rubbish.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few months following the announcement of Professor Leidy's\r\nand Dr. Willcox's opinions, Mr. Keely continued his researches\r\nunder favourable circumstances; but, in the autumn of 1890, he was\r\nagain threatened with suits-at-law and harassed by demands to give\r\nexhibitions in order to raise the price of stock. A subscription\r\nwas started to raise funds for the prosecution. These threats made\r\nit necessary to make public the history of Keely's connection with\r\nan organization which was supposed by many to have been formed for\r\nspeculative purposes, before the stock of the company possessed any\r\nvalue other than prospective; but to which company, notwithstanding,\r\nthe world is indebted for supplying Mr. Keely with the means to\r\ncontinue his work, at a time when it was impossible for him to gain\r\nthe recognition of science or the aid of capitalists. The discovery\r\nwould in all probability have been lost, but for the help which\r\nthis organization gave, at a time when Keely needed help; he had\r\nmade a discovery, and these shrewd business men, totally ignorant of\r\nphysics, knew enough to comprehend its financial importance. Never\r\ndoubting that Keely would be able to master the difficulties at once,\r\nin the way of its subjugation, and not realizing the width of the\r\ngulf that lies between discovery and invention, they expected him to\r\nleap it with one bound; and when he failed to do so they threw upon\r\nhim all the odium which befell the enterprise. Keely, who had twice\r\ndestroyed his researching instruments, when harassed and threatened\r\nby the managers of the company, first in 1882, and again in 1887,\r\nwas now placed by their threatened proceedings in a position where\r\nhe had to choose between continuing his researches with the end in\r\nview of completing his system; or diverting his course and resuming\r\nhis efforts to perfect an engine, to continue exhibitions for the\r\npurpose of raising the stock of the company.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture an attempt was made to have circulated among the\r\nstock-holders a narrative setting forth facts to show that their\r\ninterests would be better served by a continuance of the researches\r\nthat had led to the results attained within the last two years; and\r\nwhich were of so important a character as to justify Keely in saying\r\nthat he had learned more of the law, governing the operation of the\r\nforce he was dealing with, in that time, than in the many preceding\r\nyears during which he had been scarcely doing more than liberating the\r\nether. The effort to have the narrative circulated failed; and, as a\r\nlast resort, the history of the company was made public in a pamphlet,\r\nentitled The Keely Motor Bubble; which contained the Minority Report of\r\nMr. John Lorimer, made, in 1881, when he was a member of the Board of\r\nDirectors of \"the now defunct Keely Motor Company;\" giving a masterly\r\nanalysis of the situation at that time. Mr. Lorimer's faith in,\r\nand loyalty to, Mr. Keely, has never been questioned. He is probably\r\nthe best and most disinterested adviser that Mr. Keely has ever had;\r\namong those who are interested solely in the commercial aspect of\r\nthe discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1881-1891.\r\n\r\nTHE KEELY MOTOR BUBBLE. MACVICAR'S LOGICAL ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\n        For it is well known that bodies act upon one another by\r\n        the attraction of gravity, magnetism, and electricity; and\r\n        these instances show the tenour and course of Nature and make\r\n        it not improbable that there may be more attractive powers\r\n        than these. For Nature is very consonant and comfortable to\r\n        herself.--Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scotch author, Macvicar, from whose \"Sketch of a Philosophy\" has\r\nbeen compiled \"Ether the True Protoplasm,\" published this year in the\r\nNew York Home Journal, says in his \"Enquiry into Human Nature,\" written\r\nin 1852, \"Modern science is certainly on the way to the discovery that,\r\nso far as is cognizable by us, throughout the whole universe the same\r\nlaws are at work and regulate all things. The mécanique céleste of\r\nmind is still waiting its Newton to disclose them to us.\"\r\n\r\nLooking upon the discoverer of etheric force as the Newton, whose\r\ncoming was forecast by Macvicar, it is satisfactory to see that Keely,\r\nin his field of research, eventually adopted the methods which his\r\nforerunner advocated nearly forty years ago; but not until after\r\nmany years of blind grappling with the mechanical difficulties which\r\nhe encountered, in his efforts to control the unknown Genii, which\r\nhe himself declares that he stumbled upon in quite another field\r\nof research. Keely was experimenting in 1875 on what he called\r\na hydro-pneumatic-pulsating-vacuo engine, when, \"accidentally,\"\r\nthe first evolution of disintegration was made. The focalization of\r\nthis quadruple force, acting on one general centre of concentration,\r\nproduced partial molecular subdivision, resulting in a pressure of some\r\nthree thousand pounds per square inch. Mr. Keely was himself amazed\r\nat this evidence of the energy which he had evoked, and at once turned\r\nhis attention to researching its nature, with the result that he came\r\nto the conclusion that he had partially resolved the gaseous element\r\nof water by crude molecular dissociation. This was his first step,\r\nand the necessary introductory one, towards the elimination of ether;\r\nbut at that time, to use his own words, he had not the remotest idea of\r\nthe etheric element proper. Since then he has constructed innumerable\r\nmachines to subdivide or dissociate the molecular; but it was not until\r\nhe had instituted certain acoustic vibratory conditions that he began\r\nto realize the magnitude of the element that he is now controlling\r\nwith his vibratory disintegrator. Yet, even this instrument was only\r\nthe stepping-stone towards polar-sympathetic-negative-attraction.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Mr. Keely conceived and constructed an instrument which he\r\ncalled a \"vibratory lift,\" and, while experimenting on the improvised\r\nmultiplication by this medium, he had occasion to put a piece of\r\nmarble, weighing twenty-six pounds, on a steel bar to hold it in\r\nplace, when then and there his first discovery of the disintegration\r\nof mineral substance took place. From that time progressive research\r\nof the most arduous nature has brought him to his present standard\r\nin vibratory physics. In the winter of 1881-82, when threatened\r\nwith imprisonment by the managers of the Keely Motor Company for not\r\ndisclosing his secret to them, which then would have been like pricking\r\na bubble, he destroyed his vibratory lift and other instruments that\r\nhe had been years in perfecting. At this time so hopeless was Keely,\r\nthat his plans were made to destroy himself, after destroying his\r\ndevices. At this critical juncture he received unexpected aid. Again,\r\nin 1888, before he was taken to a felon's cell in Moyamensing Prison\r\nby decree of Judge Finletter for alleged contempt of court, he broke\r\nup his vibratory microscope, his sympathetic transmitter, and some\r\ndevices, which have taken much of his time since to reconstruct. It\r\nwould seem to be incomprehensible that a man who believes he has been\r\nspecially endowed by Providence to convey great truths to the world,\r\nshould have destroyed instruments which were the result of the labour\r\nof many years of research; but Schopenhauer tells us that genius\r\npossesses an abnormally developed nervous and cerebral system that\r\nbrings with it hyper-sensibility, which in union with intensity of\r\nwill-energy, that is also characteristic of genius, occasions quick\r\nchanges of mood and extravagant outbursts. Schopenhauer also explains\r\nwhy it is that men of genius are ignored by the age in which they\r\nappear:--\"The genius comes into his age like a comet into the paths\r\nof the planets, to whose well-regulated and comprehensible order its\r\nentirely eccentric course is foreign. Accordingly he cannot go hand\r\nin hand with the existing regular progress to the culture of the\r\nage, but flings his works far out on the way in front (as the dying\r\nEmperor flung his spear among the enemy), which time has first to\r\novertake. The achievement of the man of genius transcends not only the\r\npower of achievement of others, but also their power of apprehension;\r\ntherefore they do not become directly conscious of him. The man of\r\ntalent is like the marksman who hits a mark the others cannot hit;\r\nthe man of genius is like the marksman who hits a mark that the sight\r\nof others cannot even reach.\" In one sense this truth applies to all\r\nmen, for, says Cicero, no man is understood excepting by his equals\r\nor his superiors.\r\n\r\nAdmitting all that has been said of the difficulties attendant upon\r\nthe comprehension of a genius by the age in which he lives, it does\r\nnot require genius to understand the blunders which, perpetrated\r\nby the managers of the prematurely organized Keely Motor Company,\r\nhave placed Mr. Keely, as well as themselves, in false positions with\r\nthe public; leaving him since the winter of 1880-81 to bear the whole\r\nburden of the infamy brought about by their having offered stock for\r\ninvestment which could possess no tangible existence in the shape\r\nof property until the laws governing the unknown force that he was\r\nhandling had been studied out and applied to mechanics in a patentable\r\nmachine. To those informed that this company ceased to hold annual\r\nmeetings as far back as 1881 it will be a matter of surprise to hear\r\nthat, sitting up in its coffin, seven or eight years after its burial,\r\nit called another annual meeting, and that now its managers are again\r\napplying the thumb-screw, as in past years; pressing their claims and\r\nthreatening a suit for obtaining money under false pretences, unless\r\nMr. Keely renounces his plan of progressive research, and gives his\r\ntime to the construction of engines for the Keely Motor Company. This\r\nrequirement, as was said in 1881, of a similar effort, is as sensible,\r\nunder existing conditions, as it would be to require Keely to devote\r\nhis time to growing figs on thorn trees. It is from the \"Minority\r\nReport to the Stockholders of the Keely Motor Company from the Board of\r\nDirectors\" (made by a member of that board in 1881, John H. Lorimer),\r\nthat the material is gleaned for disclosing facts which it is due\r\nto Mr. Keely should now, since this last attempt to intimidate him,\r\nbe given to the public. The stock of that company is not lessened\r\nin value by the mismanagement of its officers and directors; for\r\nMr. Keely's moral obligations to its stockholders are as sacred to\r\nhim as if the company had not long since forfeited its charter. When\r\nMr. Keely became financially independent of the company last March,\r\nspeculation in the stock of that company received its death blow,\r\nand the \"Keely Motor Bubble\" burst, leaving to the stockholders all\r\nthat ever had any tangible existence in the shape of property in a\r\nmore valuable position than it had ever been before. Mr. Lorimer is\r\na gentleman of Scotch birth, who was elected a director of the Keely\r\nMotor Company in 1881, and who resigned in 1882, because he was \"unable\r\nto carry the enterprise,\" and unwilling to fall in with the policy of\r\nthe old directors. Before resigning, he set himself to studying the\r\nposition of affairs with a view to forming for the Board a definite\r\nplan of action which ordinary business principles would justify.\r\n\r\nThis course resulted in a thoroughly business-like letter to Mr. Keely\r\nin which, under nine heads, Mr. Lorimer set down the conclusions he\r\nhad reached as to the cause of the difficulties that had culminated\r\nin a threatened law suit, and Mr. Keely was ordered to ask that a\r\nspecial meeting of the Board should be called at once, to consider any\r\nproposition he should see fit to make towards settling the question\r\nwhether he should proceed with the company's work or be permitted\r\nto defer it, as he so much desired, until he had fully developed the\r\nadaptations of his power already known to him or hereafter possible\r\nof discovery by him. Mr. Lorimer added:--\"And now, in conclusion,\r\nI may say to you that the above deductions from the history of your\r\nmotor are the result of patient and laborious inquiry on my part,\r\nand I am truly at a loss to understand how, or in what manner, other\r\nthan that herein suggested, you can honourably vindicate your position;\r\nand as no one I have met connected with the enterprise, or personally\r\nacquainted with you, hesitates for an instant in crediting you with\r\nthe most unswerving integrity, I have no hesitation in offering the\r\nabove suggestions for your consideration; and I trust you will so\r\nfar adopt them as to enable the active portion of your friends to\r\nbring the organization rapidly into harmonious accord with you in\r\nthe development of what all seem to think is the greatest wonder of\r\nour civilization, the early completion of which will lift you to the\r\nhighest pinnacle of fame as a scientist, and make them co-dispensers\r\nwith you of the God-given wealth of which you hold the key.\" The date\r\nis 10th of February, 1881.\r\n\r\nThis letter was followed by another dated February 11th, in which\r\nMr. Lorimer submitted certain conclusions, arrived at after meeting\r\nin New York with several members of the Board of Directors, one of\r\nwhich reads:--\"It seems to be generally understood that without your\r\nhearty co-operation and good will, the company cannot realize value\r\nupon any existing contracts, or any they may hereafter make with you.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Lorimer states that he had the opportunity presented\r\nof studying, semi-officially, the very peculiar man whose genius held\r\nhis friends so spell-bound that they lost their power (if such they\r\npossessed) to adapt business methods to the enterprise. \"To meet him\r\nsocially in his shop,\" Mr. Lorimer writes, \"after his day's work, was,\r\nI think, invariably to be impressed with his earnestness, honesty of\r\npurpose, and above all, with confidence in his knowledge of the plane\r\nof science he was working in (acoustics), and, at the same time to\r\nbe impressed with the folly of basing calculations for the government\r\nof the business details of the organization upon the statements made\r\nby him while contemplating the possible result of his researches.\"\r\n\r\nWith the hopeful spirit of an inventor, Mr. Keely always anticipated\r\nalmost immediate mechanical success, up to the hour in which he\r\nabandoned the automatic arrangement that was necessary to make his\r\ngenerator patentable. From that time his line of perspective extended,\r\nand he began to realize that he had been too sanguine in the past. He\r\nhad been like a man grappling in the dark with a foe, the form of\r\nwhich had not even presented itself to his imagination; but when,\r\nin 1884, Macvicar's work on the structure of ether came like a torch\r\nto reveal the face of his antagonist, what wonder that he, with the\r\nenthusiasm of Paracelsus, felt his\r\n\r\n\r\n        ... \"fluttering pulse give evidence that God\r\n        Means good to me, will make my cause His own;\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand, as in 1881, again rashly bound himself anew, by fresh promises,\r\nmade to those who had the power to give or to withhold the sinews\r\nneeded in the warfare he was waging?\r\n\r\nTo return to the report. During the negotiations which followed,\r\nfacts in the history of the company were developed which convinced\r\nMr. Lorimer that Mr. Keely was totally unable to measure time, or\r\ndefine his plans, because of the ever-changing results attained by\r\nhim, in researching the laws governing the force he was trying to\r\nharness. At this time the treasurer of the company was proposing to\r\nbring over from New York to Philadelphia a number of capitalists\r\nto witness an exhibition of the production of the force, in order\r\nto dispose of 500 shares at 25.00 dollars a share. To this plan\r\nMr. Lorimer objected, writing to the treasurer, \"I fear that you would\r\nbe putting yourself in a false position with the friends you might\r\ninduce to take stock at the figures named,\" and Mr. Keely himself\r\nat first refused to give the exhibition, but upon the application\r\nof the thumb-screw, kept in readiness, it took place. At this time\r\nMr. Lorimer wrote to the president of the company, \"If Keely gives\r\nus the benefit of his discoveries, it will require all our energies\r\nto guide our enterprise; and, on the other hand, if he dies or is\r\nforestalled, it will need all our care and attention to take care\r\nof our reputations.... The fact that the Board has some delicate and\r\nimportant work to perform, brings us to the question, Are we properly\r\norganized to perform our part? If we are, let us show it by our acts,\r\nand, if not, let us act like men, worthy the important trust before\r\nus. If I am overestimating the character and importance of this\r\nwork, you can show it to me; and per contra, if I am correct, you\r\ncan and will accept the responsibilities of the position you hold,\r\nno matter how unpleasant, no matter how irksome, if understood by\r\nyou and honourably supported by us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lorimer then prepared this summary, or analysis of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n26th July, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"First.--The existence of a discovery or invention which from\r\nevidences of its adaptability (when complete) to the industrial\r\narts and sciences, may be esteemed the most valuable discovery\r\nof civilization in modern or in ancient times, inasmuch as it\r\nrevolutionizes all known methods of generating power.\r\n\r\n\"Second.--The retention by the discoverer and inventor of all the\r\nsecrets whereby these discoveries can be utilized by the public, thus\r\nmaking their future existence, so far as the Keely Motor Company is\r\nconcerned, depend entirely upon his life and goodwill.\r\n\r\n\"Third.--The existence of a corporated company, organized for the\r\npurpose of furnishing funds for the development and completion of the\r\ndiscovery, and for the final control of certain specified inventions,\r\nin certain specified localities.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.--The contracts under which the above-mentioned control of\r\ncertain inventions is vested in the Keely Motor Company, being mere\r\nevidences of intention, have no real value until the inventor has\r\nreceived his patents and verified the contracts by transfer of the\r\nsame to the company.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.--If any conflict should arise between the company and the\r\ninventor, in which the latter felt justified in withholding the\r\ntransfer, the existing contracts might be a good foundation to build\r\nlitigation upon but not good for investment in.\r\n\r\n\"Sixth.--The uncertainty of the future of the enterprise, as thus\r\nindicated, must of necessity invite speculative management; and while\r\nspeculation under some circumstances is legitimate and laudable,\r\nunder other conditions it may become illegitimate and reprehensible.\r\n\r\n\"Seventh.-- The existence of a speculative management in Keely Motor\r\naffairs has, of necessity, developed two interests--one which holds\r\nthat the completion of the discovery in all its possible grandeur\r\nshould ever be the sole object of its management, and the other,\r\nbelieving that on account of the human uncertainty of the completion\r\nof the invention, they are in duty bound to make quick recoveries\r\non their investments, so that they may be safe financially, in the\r\nevent of a failure by Keely to perfect his inventions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to pursue this summary farther, as the manner in\r\nwhich Mr. Lorimer has set down the facts already given, makes clear the\r\nnature of the conflicting interests that brought about the antagonism\r\nwhich he attempted to subdue, bringing such a spirit of fairness and\r\njustice into his efforts as must have crowned them with success,\r\nsupported as he was by Mr. Keely, had it not been that those who\r\nadvocated following a policy which, at best, aimed no farther than\r\nat the recouping of losses to themselves, were in the majority. It\r\nwas at this time that Mr. Keely manifested his willingness to assume,\r\non the one hand, all the responsibility of the proper development of\r\nhis discovery; or, on the other hand, all the disgrace accompanying\r\nfailure by his offer to purchase a controlling interest in the stock,\r\nfifty-one thousand shares of which, in order to prevent speculation,\r\nhe agreed to lock up for five years, and to give the company a bond\r\nrestraining him from negotiating or parting with a single share of it\r\nin that time, the stock to be paid for as soon as certain deferred\r\npayments had been made to him. This proposition of Mr. Keely to the\r\nBoard of Directors, October 25th, 1881 (and laid upon the table by a\r\nlarge majority as unworthy of consideration), was made from his earnest\r\ndesire to control the presentation of his life's work to the world\r\nin a just and honourable way; having recognized, with Mr. Lorimer,\r\nthe utter impossibility of reconciling the numerous interests created\r\nby mistakes of himself and the mismanagement of the Board, unless he\r\ncould thus obtain the power to deliver an unencumbered enterprise to\r\nthe world. In the opinion of Mr. Lorimer, during the negotiations which\r\nhe conducted between the management and Mr. Keely, the latter was the\r\nonly one who had manifested any consistency or strength of purpose,\r\nso far as the facts gave evidence, which were brought before him, of\r\nthe history of the company. When the validity of the contracts made\r\nwith Mr. Keely while he was president, or director of the company, were\r\ndisputed, he was called upon to resign, which he did; and yet no steps\r\nwere taken to ascertain the value of the existing contracts, which\r\nhad all been made with him while he was both president and director,\r\nand which were therefore illegal. Proceedings in equity were commenced\r\nagainst Mr. Keely, by the Committee of the Board of Directors having\r\nthe matter in charge, late in the year 1881, while Mr. Lorimer's report\r\nwas still in the hands of the printer. \"The spectacle of a Board of\r\nthirteen Directors, composed of business men,\" writes Mr. Lorimer,\r\n\"claiming that they have been foiled in their business calculations\r\nby a man whose mind has been so thoroughly absorbed in researching\r\nthe problems presented by his wonderful discoveries that he could\r\nnot possibly compare with any of them in business tact, is truly\r\na phenomenon which is not easy of explanation on any hypothesis,\r\nbut the one that their visions of prospective wealth have been so\r\noverpowering as to undo their prudence; and then having in due process\r\nof time discovered their error, it certainly is an edifying spectacle\r\nto see them now trying to throw all the blame on one poor mortal wholly\r\nabsorbed in his inventions, and by these efforts disturbing that mental\r\nequilibrium of both the inventor and themselves, which is absolutely\r\nnecessary to ultimate success. When boys, in early summer, pick unripe\r\nfruit and eat it, because of their unwillingness to await the ripening\r\nthereof, they sometimes suffer acutely for their haste. Yet no one\r\never thinks of punishing the tree because of their sufferings; nor\r\nis it deemed necessary to justice to preserve the fruit of the tree,\r\nwhen ripe, for the sole use of the impatient ones as a recompense for\r\ntheir early sufferings! So it has been with the Keely Motor Company;\r\nundue haste to gather the golden fruit that was to come from it, has\r\nled to a great deal of suffering financially among a few impatient\r\nbelievers. Still it does not seem to me to be wise to curse the\r\ninventor, or his inventions because he has not given us the fruit\r\nwhen we expected it would be ripe.\"...\r\n\r\nThe effort to force Keely to divulge his secrets failed, for at\r\nthat time he had nothing of a practical nature to divulge, and though\r\npossessing no business qualifications, he was too shrewd to cut off any\r\nof his resources for supplies, necessary to enable him to persevere\r\nin his efforts to attain some practical result, as he surely would\r\nhave done, had he said, \"I know very little more than you know of\r\nthe laws governing the force I have discovered. I can only control\r\ntheir operation by experimental research, and the more time that\r\nis wasted in building engines, until I have made myself acquainted\r\nwith these laws, the longer will you have to wait for your golden\r\nfruit.\" Mr. Keely was no more able at that time to give the faintest\r\nidea of the present stage of his researches than Professor Leidy or\r\nDr. Wilcox could now, after witnessing the experiments in sympathetic\r\nattraction, write out a clear formulation of its governing law, and\r\nan inductive substantiation of it. Even were it possible, no reader\r\ncould understand it because the discovery made by Mr. Keely is not\r\nin accordance with any of the facts known to science. Mr. Keely's\r\nexperiments in disintegrating water prove that incalculable amounts\r\nof latent force exist in the molecular spaces; but in the opinion\r\nof scientists, molecular aggregation is attended with dissipation\r\nof energy, not with absorption of energy. If the men of science are\r\nright, then there must be an absolute creation of energy, for only by\r\nadmitting its absorption in aggregation, could molecular dissociation\r\nsupply the force witnessed. Keely, of course, denies any creation\r\nof energy, claiming only that he can produce an indefinite supply by\r\nthe expenditure of an infinitesimally small amount of energy. Every\r\nnew discovery necessitates a new nomenclature. The vocabulary coined\r\nby Mr. Keely, to meet his requirements in formulating his hypotheses\r\ninto theories as he progresses, conveys as little meaning to those\r\nwho read his writings, as the word \"electricity\" conveyed 200 years\r\nago. Professor Crookes remarked that reading Mr. Keely's writings was\r\nlike reading Persian without a dictionary. Another learned professor\r\nsaid that they seemed to him to be composed in an unknown tongue, so\r\nprofoundly unintelligible had he found the extracts sent to him. One\r\nmust be familiar with Mr. Keely's instruments and their operation,\r\nin order to comprehend even the nature of his researches.\r\n\r\nAn author of philosophical works, who was present at some experiments\r\nillustrative of varying chords of mass, and whose theories had\r\nnot been in unison with those of Mr. Keely on that subject, sat\r\nfor some time after the demonstration with his eyes fixed upon the\r\nfloor, wearing as serious an expression of countenance as if he were\r\nlooking on the grave of his most cherished views. The first remark\r\nthat he made was, \"What would Jules Verne say if he were here?\" The\r\nrotation of the needle of a compass, the compass placed on a glass\r\nslab and connected with the transmitter by a wire, 120 revolutions in\r\na second, had the same effect upon the scientists present, one of awe;\r\nso completely were they transfixed and unable to form a conjecture\r\nas to the mysterious influence from any known law of science. There\r\nwas only one professor present, a very young man, who ventured the\r\nwhispered suggestion of concealed mechanism under the pedestal; and\r\nas Mr. Keely soon after had occasion to wheel the pedestal across the\r\nroom, showing that it was not stationary, and could have no concealed\r\nconnection within or without, the young professor took up another\r\nline of conjecture. As Macvicar says, it has grown to be the fashion,\r\nto a marvellous extent, to give predominance in education to physical\r\nand mathematical studies over moral and mental. Hence a very general\r\nand growing prepossession in favour of material nature. Astronomy,\r\nnatural philosophy, chemistry, natural history, geology, these and\r\nthe like are in our day held to be everything. He continues:--\r\n\r\nNow, all these branches of study, however various in detail, agree\r\nin this, that they exclude the conception of a true self-directive\r\npower from the field of thought. They offer for consideration nothing\r\nbut figures, movements, and laws. And thus they tend to form the\r\npopular mind to the habit of looking for figures, movements, and laws\r\neverywhere, and for rejecting all other conceptions as intruders. But\r\nof all such other conceptions, there is nothing so difficult and so\r\nintractable, under physical modes of investigation, as self-directive\r\npower. It therefore runs a great risk of being rejected, and thus\r\nthe mind, from its first training, having been in physics, carrying\r\nout here, as it usually does everywhere, its first love into all its\r\nafter thoughts, shuts up the student surreptitiously with materialism\r\nas his philosophy. Thus it is easy to see how materialism should\r\ncome to be a current opinion, when the popular education runs all\r\nin favour of physical pursuits. But if philosophy must yield to the\r\ndemands of the logical faculty for an extreme simplicity, unity,\r\nidentity, at the fountain-head of nature, it were more logical to\r\nregard those phenomena and laws named physical, such as the laws of\r\nmotion, elasticity, gravitation, etc., as manifestations, when existing\r\nunder certain limiting conditions, of substances or beings which have\r\nalso in them, when not so limited, and when existing under certain\r\nconditions, ability to manifest self-directive power. That every body\r\nis compounded, constituted, or made up of molecules, is universally\r\nagreed. Every body is therefore a fit subject for analysis. But when\r\nany body is submitted to analysis in reference to its mere corporeity\r\nor bodily nature, that is, its extension and impenetrability, what do\r\nwe ultimately arrive at? Do we not, in reference to the attribute of\r\nextension, arrive at particles, of which the physical limit is that\r\nthey have at least ceased to be extended, and are but mere points\r\nin space? And as to the attribute of impenetrability, what do we in\r\nthe last analysis arrive at, but the idea of a substance that can\r\nresist the intrusion into its place of other similar substances,\r\nand, therefore, ultimately, a centre of force. And thus, under a\r\nlogical analysis, which must be admitted to be legitimate, it may\r\nbe maintained that a body or chemical element resolves itself into a\r\nsystem of centres of force balancing each other at certain distances,\r\nand thus rendering the whole molecule or mass extended, as body is\r\nknown to be. The elements of body, therefore, are things of which\r\nthese attributes are to be affirmed in the first instance, that\r\nthey possess unextended substance and extensive power. But, if so,\r\ndo they not touch upon the confines of the spiritual world to say\r\nthe least? asks Macvicar; and the Newton whom he anticipated would\r\ngive a mécanique céleste to mankind, solves the problem, answers the\r\nquestion by his discovery of the cerebellic stream or will-flow.\r\n\r\nBody and spirit, one at the fountain-head, when rising into\r\nexistence, form, as it were, the first breath of creation; for,\r\nas Sir Wm. Thompson says: \"Life proceeds from life and from nothing\r\nelse.\" They are the opposite poles of being and constitute the two\r\nprinciples by the harmonious interweaving of which the beautiful\r\nsystem of creation is constituted, and its economy worked out. Such a\r\nview, far from being contrary to the canons of science, is even the\r\nnecessary complement of science. That unity, which is the last word\r\nof science, must always include two objects, existing in contrast\r\nafter all. The law of couples, of opposites, of reciprocal action\r\nbetween two contrasted yet homogeneous and harmonizing elements, each\r\nof which opens a field for the other, and brings it into action, is\r\nof universal extent. In the organic world, also, no less than in the\r\npurely physical and chemical, all is framed according to the same law\r\nof couples. In the sphere of sensibility, in like manner, everything\r\nturns on the antagonism of pleasure and pain, and in the moral sphere\r\nof good and evil. Nor is the world of pure intellect exempt from this\r\nlaw, but on the contrary displays its influence everywhere. Hence faith\r\nand sight, identity and difference, finite and infinite, objective and\r\nsubjective, space and time, cause and effect, the world of realities\r\nand the world of ideas. In a word, every system of thought and of\r\nthings, when complete, present as its basis two co-ordinate elements,\r\nthe reciprocals of each other; or one parted into two reciprocally,\r\nand by the harmonious antagonism of both the beautiful web of nature\r\nis woven. If we are to be consistent, mind and matter ought always to\r\nbe viewed as distinct, and the opposite poles of being; inertia, or\r\nunvarying submissiveness to the laws of motion being the characteristic\r\nof the one; self-directive power the characteristic of the other.\r\n\r\nThe universal analogy of science sanctioned Macvicar in the\r\ncharacteristic he thus arrived at as that of animated nature, for if\r\ninertia, or the obedience to pressures and impulses from without,\r\nbe the characteristic of matter, then that which is needed as the\r\nother term to complete the couple is just what has been insisted\r\non, viz., self-directive power, the power to cause pressures and\r\nimpulses. Here is shown the symmetrical relation in which this power,\r\nwhen viewed as the characteristic of the whole animal kingdom (which\r\nplainly points to man, and culminates in human nature), places the\r\nanimal in relation with the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms. Of\r\nminerals or crystals, the characteristic is simply self-imposing\r\nor self-concreting power. They are, so to speak, merely insoluble\r\nseeds without an embryo. To this, self-developing power is added in\r\nplants, and forms their acknowledged characteristic. While of animals\r\nthe characteristic, according to the view here advanced (the same\r\nseed-producing, self-developing, powers continuing) is self-directive\r\npower superadded. This relationship between these three kingdoms of\r\nnature is as homogeneous and symmetrical as is necessary to appear\r\nto be legitimate, and is a true expression of the order of nature.\r\n\r\nGranting these two principles, the inert and the self-directive, the\r\nnecessary and the free, we obtain the materials for a universe, without\r\ndisputing the fact of human liberty and bringing into suspicion even\r\nthe possibility either of morality or immorality. If man be really\r\nfree as well as under law, in this union of body and spirit, then in\r\nhuman nature heaven and earth truly embrace each other; and no reason\r\nappears why, as the ages roll on, our own free thought may not have\r\nthe run of the universe.... What study then can be more replete with\r\ninterest, what researches can possess more of fascination, than those\r\nwhich Mr. Keely's discoveries are preparing the way for?\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Mr. Keely (demonstrated--as he is now prepared\r\nto demonstrate them) cannot be disputed, though his system may\r\nbe called in question. With the humility of genius, he calls his\r\ntheories hypotheses, and his hypotheses conjectures. The solidity\r\nof the principles, as laid down by himself, cannot be decided upon\r\nby others until he has brought to light the whole system that grows\r\nout of them. But it is time the public should know that the odium\r\nthrown upon him by the Keely Motor Company, he does not deserve. It is\r\ntime that the Press should cease its sneers, its cry of \"Crucify him,\r\ncrucify him!\" morally speaking, and extend to him that discriminating\r\nappreciation of his work and encouragement which the New York Home\r\nJournal, Truth, Detroit Tribune, Chicago Herald, Toledo Blade,\r\nAtlanta Constitution, The Statesman, and Vienna News have been the\r\nfirst to do. Let the Press contrast the past history of science with\r\nthe present position of Keely, as Professor Dewar has done. Only such\r\na man who knows from experience the labour, the difficulties, the\r\nuncertainties, attendant upon researching unknown laws of nature is\r\nable to appreciate all that is now being concentrated in the single\r\nlife of one man. It is time that capitalists should step from their\r\nranks to protect Keely from the selfish policy of the managers of\r\na speculative company, which has long since forfeited all claims\r\nupon him, to continue mechanical work for it, even admitting that it\r\never possessed that right; and, more than all else, it is time that\r\nscience should send her delegates to confer with the broad-minded\r\nmen who have had the courage to give testimony, without which Keely\r\ncould not have stood where, this year, he stands for the first time,\r\nfearless of threats, pursuing his researches on his own line, to\r\nacquire that knowledge of the laws governing his discoveries by\r\nwhich alone he can gain sufficient control of machinery to insure\r\nfinancial success. Meanwhile, are there no men who are able to feel\r\nan interest (without reference to commercial results) in a discovery\r\nwhich sweeps away the débris of materialism as chaff is swept before\r\na whirlwind?--giving indisputable proof that, as St. Paul teaches, \"we\r\nare the offspring of God; \"or, as Aratus wrote, from whom he quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"From God we must originate,\r\n                Not any time we break the spell\r\n                That binds us to the ineffable.\r\n                Indeed, we all are evermore\r\n                Having to do with God: for we\r\n                His very kind and offspring be:\r\n                And to His offspring the benign\r\n                Fails not to give benignant sign.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom New York Truth, 3rd July, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is safe, for even the most conservative and pig-headed of\r\nscientists, to admit that Keely, the contemned, the scoffed at, the\r\nderided, the man whom every picayune peddler called charlatan because\r\nhe could not harness the hitherto undiscovered forces of ether in less\r\ntime than one might hitch up a mule, is the most original and the most\r\nstraightforward of inventors, and that in his own good time he will\r\ngive to the world a power that will throw steam and electricity into\r\ndisuse, open the realms of air as a public highway for man, and send\r\ngreat ships careering over ocean with a power developed by sound. His\r\ntheory of etheric vibration is now conclusively established, and it is\r\nonly a question of time and material that delays its use as a servant\r\nto man. The fact is patent, so that he who runs may read, but the ox\r\nmust have the yoke, the horse the collar, the engine the cylinder, and\r\nthe dynamo the coil, ere they can work their wonders. While Keely was\r\nhampered by mere tradesmen, who only looked to the immediate recoupment\r\nof their outlay, men more anxious for dividends than discoveries, he\r\ncould do little save turn showman, and exhibit his partial control of\r\nthe harmonies of nature as springs catch woodcocks, and was forced to\r\nopen his crude contrivances to divert the eternal will of the cosmos\r\nto work-a-day uses, that he might coax from the greed and credulity\r\nof mere mammon-worshippers the sorely grudged means to continue his\r\nexploration of the infinite. His genius was prisoned in a test tube,\r\nand only let out to play monkey tricks before muddle-headed merchants,\r\nwho could see the effect, but not the means, and so the greatest\r\ndiscovery of the age was turned into a raree show, and the eternal\r\nmusic of the spheres was set, figuratively speaking, to play tunes\r\nto attract custom like a barrel organ before a dime museum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nVIBRATORY SYMPATHETIC POLAR FLOWS.--KEELY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n                \"Evermore brave feet in all the ages\r\n                  Climb the heights that hide the coming day,--\r\n                Evermore they cry, these seers and sages,\r\n                  From their cloud, 'Our doctrines make no way.'\r\n                All too high they stand above the nations,\r\n                  Shouting forth their trumpet-calls sublime,\r\n                Shouting downwards their interpretations\r\n                  Of the wondrous secrets born of Time.\"\r\n\r\n        ... Who can say what secrets the now unread 'fairy tales of\r\n        science' may have to tell to those who live in this later\r\n        age?--The Globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question has often been asked, \"How much energy does Keely\r\nexpend in the production of the force he is handling?\" or again,\r\n\"Can Keely show that a foot-pound of vibratory sympathy can be more\r\neasily developed from the resources of nature, than a foot-pound of\r\ngood honest work?\"\r\n\r\nIn the economy of nature profit and loss must balance in mechanical\r\nconditions; but Keely is not dealing with mechanical physics. There\r\nis an immense difference between vibratory physics, in which field\r\nKeely is researching, and mechanical physics. The consumption of coal\r\nto expand water for the production of steam power, in the operation of\r\nengines, cannot be compared to a force which is yielded in sympathetic\r\nvibration or by sympathetic flows. In mechanical physics, no matter\r\nwhat the nature of the force may be, its production must necessarily\r\nbe accompanied by a corresponding expenditure of force in some form\r\nor other. The amount of force covered by a human volition cannot be\r\nmeasured, yet it produces the wonderful effects that are exhibited\r\non the human frame in its overt actions. Something like this is the\r\ndifference between sympathetical and mechanical force. The force of\r\nwill cannot be multiplied by mechanical means, making it give pound\r\nfor pound. This would annihilate both the mental and the physical,\r\nwere it possible.\r\n\r\nIn his researches, Mr. Keely, who is dealing entirely with VIBRATORY\r\nSYMPATHETIC and POLAR flows, is hopeless in regard to convincing\r\nthe scientific world of the value of his discoveries until he has\r\ncompelled its attention by commercial success. To the question,\r\n\"What does the supply cost in dollars and cents, per horse-power\r\ndeveloped?\" he answers, \"It costs nothing more after the machinery\r\nis made, than the vibratory concordant impulse which associates it\r\nwith the polar stream.\" The twanging of a taut string, the agitation\r\nof a tuning-fork, as associated with the resonating condition of\r\nthe sympathetic transmitter, is all that is necessary to induce the\r\nconnective link, and to produce this \"costless motive power.\" As\r\nlong as the transmitter is in sympathy with the sympathetic current\r\nof the triune polar stream, the action of the sympathetic instrument\r\nor engine continues.\r\n\r\nAgain, mechanical conservation of energy is one thing; sympathetic\r\nconservation is another, and we cannot expect Keely will reveal what\r\nhe has discovered concerning the forces that he is dealing with\r\nuntil he has himself acquired that full knowledge of their action\r\nwhich will protect the rights of those who are interested in the\r\n\"dollars and cents\" part of \"the enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nMacvicar said that \"if extreme vicissitudes of belief on the part of\r\nmen of science are evidences of uncertainty, it may be affirmed that\r\nof all kinds of knowledge none is more uncertain than science;\" but\r\nslow as mankind is in the progress of discoveries bearing upon unknown\r\nlaws of nature, men of science are still slower in recognizing truths\r\nafter they have been discovered and demonstrated. Two centuries\r\nelapsed between the discoveries of Pythagoras and their revival\r\nby Copernicus. Tycho Brahe opposed the Pythagorean system until\r\nhis death; Galileo, adopting it and demonstrating it in all its\r\npurity, suffered for his support of it at the hands of bigots. And so\r\nhistory now repeats itself. Were it possible to convince scientists\r\nen masse of the grandeur of Keely's work, they would protect him\r\nfrom the interruptions and law-suits which have so retarded his\r\nprogress that now it looks very much as though he would never be\r\npermitted to complete his system. The world is full of inventors,\r\nbut there is but one man able to unfold, to this age and generation,\r\nthe wonderful mysteries attendant upon vibratory physics, while there\r\nare thousands who, when a mastery of the principle has been gained,\r\ncan invent machinery to apply it to commercial uses. Macvicar asks,\r\n\"Who that goes so far as to make a question of all, or almost all, the\r\ndata of common sense can legitimately refrain from making it a question\r\nwhether the laws of phenomena which men of science discover may not\r\nbe laws of thinking, merely imposed upon nature as her laws? Nay, who\r\ncan refrain from admitting with Kant that they can be nothing more?\"\r\n\r\nAs a suggestion to those interested in psychological researches I\r\nwill mention that Keely has copied nature in all his instruments\r\nfrom the Vibrophone, which is fashioned after the human ear, up\r\nto the Disintegrator, in which the neutral centre represents the\r\nhuman heart. With the system which Keely is unfolding to us we may\r\nwell say, with Buckle, \"A vast and splendid career lies before us,\r\nwhich it will take many ages to complete. As we surpass our fathers,\r\nso will our children surpass us. Waging against the forces of nature\r\nwhat has too often been a precarious, unsteady, and unskilled warfare,\r\nwe have never yet put forth the whole of our strength, and have never\r\nunited all our faculties against our common foe. We have, therefore,\r\nbeen often worsted, and have sustained many and grievous reverses. But,\r\neven so, such is the elasticity of the human mind, such is the energy\r\nof that immortal and godlike principle which lives within us, that we\r\nare baffled without being discouraged, our very defeats quickening our\r\nresources, and we may hope that our descendants, benefiting by our\r\nfailures, will profit by our example, and that for them is reserved\r\nthat last and decisive stage of the great conflict between man and\r\nnature, in which advancing from success to success, fresh trophies\r\nwill be constantly won; every struggle issuing in a conquest, and\r\nevery battle ending in a victory.\"\r\n\r\nThe force discovered by Keely--no, the force revealed to him--will rule\r\nthe earth with an influence mighty in the interests of humanity. The\r\ncompletion of his system for science and commerce will usher in the\r\ndawning of a new era.\r\n\r\nWhile our leading men of science are everywhere occupying themselves\r\nwith the mysteries of electro-magnetic radiation, with the action\r\nof the ether, with the structure of the molecule, the instruments\r\nwith which they are researching are, in comparison with those which\r\nKeely has invented, for his researches, like the rudest implements\r\nof the savage, compared to those developed by modern civilization. A\r\ndiscussion has recently been carried on in one of our Reviews, as to\r\nwhether the energy which feeds the magnet comes from the atmosphere,\r\nfrom gravity, from solar rays, or from earth currents. Nothing is more\r\nsimple than Keely's explanation, as proved by his demonstrations. The\r\nenergy of the magnet comes from the polar stream; and, though the\r\nintroductory impulse is so slight that it cannot be weighed any\r\nmore than can the flow of the mind, yet, if kept up for years, it\r\ncould not be computed by billions of tons in its effect. The magnet\r\nthat lifts pounds to-day, if the load of the armature is gradually\r\nincreased day by day, will lift double the amount in time. Whence\r\ncomes this energy? Keely teaches that it comes from sympathetic\r\nassociation with one of the triune currents of the polar stream,\r\nand that its energy will increase as long as sympathetic flows last,\r\nwhich is through eternity.\r\n\r\nThe physicist tells you that \"you cannot make something out of\r\nnothing;\" that \"in the economy of nature profit and loss must balance;\"\r\nthat \"no matter what the nature of the force may be, its production\r\nmust necessarily be accompanied by a corresponding expenditure of\r\nforce in some form or other,\" etc., etc. But, in the prodigality of\r\nnature, this energy flows, without measure and without price, from the\r\ngreat storehouse of the Infinite Will. From the sympathetic portion\r\nof the etheric field, all visible aggregations of matter emanate,\r\nand on the same order that molecular masses of all living organisms\r\nare vitalized by the sympathetic flow from the brain.\r\n\r\n\"Our most learned men,\" said Buckle, \"know not what magnetism is,\r\nnor electricity, nor gravity, nor cohesion, nor force.\" Keely shows\r\nus, by mechanical means, what magnetism is. By neutralizing or\r\novercoming gravity, he proves to us that he understands its nature;\r\nelectricity he declares to be a certain form of atomic vibration;\r\nand, in the disintegration of quartz, he demonstrates that cohesive\r\nforce, like gravity, is an ever-existing force, holding together all\r\nmolecular masses by the infinite velocity of its vibrations; which,\r\nwere these vibrations to cease for one instant, would fall apart,\r\nmolecules and atoms, and return to the ether in which they originated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEELY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE. [9]\r\n\r\n        An infinitely subtle substance, out of which all other\r\n        substances are constituted, in varying forms, passes back again\r\n        into simplicity. The same principle underlies the harmonies\r\n        of music and the motion of heavenly bodies.--Pythagoras.\r\n\r\n        One of the most arduous problems is that of energies\r\n        acting at distances. Are they real? Of all those that appear\r\n        incontrollable, one only remains, gravitation. Will it escape\r\n        us also? The laws of its action incline us to think so. The\r\n        nature of electricity is another problem which recalls us\r\n        to the condition of electric and magnetic forces through\r\n        space. Behind this question arises the most important problem\r\n        of all, that of the nature and properties of the substance\r\n        which fills space,--the ether,--its structure, its motion, its\r\n        limits, if it possesses any. We find this subject of research,\r\n        day by day, predominating over all others. It seems as though\r\n        a knowledge of ether should not only reveal to us the nature of\r\n        that imponderable substance, but will unveil to us the essence\r\n        of matter itself and of its inherent properties, weight and\r\n        inertia. Soon the question set by modern physics will be,\r\n        \"Are not all things due to conditions of ether?\" That is\r\n        the ultimate end of our science; these are the most exalted\r\n        summits to which we can hope to attain. Shall we ever reach\r\n        them? Will it be soon? We cannot answer.--Prof. Henri Hertz,\r\n        in La Revue Scientifique, October 26, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the long delay attendant upon the application to mechanics of the\r\nunknown force which John Ernest Worrell Keely has discovered in the\r\nfield of vibration, the question is often heard, \"What has Keely\r\ndone?\" with the remark, \"He has never done anything; he is always\r\npromising to do something, but he never keeps his promises.\"\r\n\r\nLet us see what Keely, in his researches, has done for science;\r\nalthough, as yet, he has done nothing for commerce.\r\n\r\nWe are quick to forget the experiences of history, which show what\r\na length of time has invariably elapsed between the discovery of a\r\nnew force and its use in mechanics. Watt commenced his experiments\r\non the elastic force of steam in 1764, obtaining about forty pounds\r\ntotal pressure per square inch. (It has been stated that it was thirty\r\nyears before he succeeded in perfecting his safety-valve, or governor,\r\nwhich made it possible to use steam without running great risks.) Fifty\r\nyears later, in 1814, the first steam locomotive was built; but it was\r\nnot until 1825 that the locomotive was used for traffic--travelling\r\nat a speed of from six to eight miles in an hour. Keely commenced his\r\nexperiments with ether in the winter of 1872-73, showing a pressure of\r\ntwo thousand pounds per square inch. It does not look now as though\r\nhalf a century would elapse before Keely's discovery will supersede\r\nsteam in travel and traffic. In experimenting with ether, he has shown,\r\nfrom time to time, since 1873, a pressure of from twenty thousand to\r\nthirty-two thousand pounds per square inch; but he was occupied many\r\nyears in his researches before he obtained sufficient control over\r\nthe ether to prevent the explosions which made wrecks of his machines,\r\nbursting iron and steel pipes, twelve inches in circumference, as if\r\nthey were straws. He has now arrived at a stage in his experimental\r\nresearch in which he can, without danger of explosions, exhibit to\r\nscientists such manifestations of an unknown force as to place him\r\nbefore the world where he would have stood many years ago, had it not\r\nbeen for the calumnious attacks of those men of science who found it\r\neasier to denounce him than to account for the phenomena which they\r\nwitnessed in his workshop.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ira Remsen, in his \"Theoretical Chemistry,\" writes, \"As\r\nregards the cause of the phenomena of the motion of the heavenly\r\nbodies, we have no conception at the present day. It is true we say\r\nthat these phenomena are caused by the attraction of gravitation;\r\nbut, after all, we do not know what pulls these bodies together.\"\r\n\r\nLet us see what Keely knows on this subject?\r\n\r\n1st. After a lifetime of research into the laws governing vibrations,\r\nwhich develop this force, Keely is able to demonstrate partial control\r\nof the power that he has discovered,--a power which he believes\r\nto be the governing medium of the universe, throughout animate and\r\ninanimate nature, controlling the advance and recession of the solar\r\nand planetary masses, and reigning in the mineral, the vegetable,\r\nand the animal kingdom, according to the laws that rule its action in\r\neach, as undeviatingly as it governs the motions of the earth itself,\r\nand of all the heavenly bodies in space.\r\n\r\nKeely calls this power, which he is endeavouring to apply in mechanics\r\nfor the benefit of mankind, \"sympathetic negative attraction,\"--it\r\nbeing necessary to use the word \"attraction,\" as no other word has\r\nyet been coined to take its place.\r\n\r\n2nd. He has determined and written out a system of the vibratory\r\nconditions governing the aggregation of all molecular masses, as to\r\ntheir relation sympathetically one to the other, stating the conditions\r\nto be brought about in order to induce antagonism or repellent action,\r\ndisintegration, etc.; but he has not yet been able to control the\r\noperation of his Disintegrator so as to use it with safety to the\r\noperator, for mining purposes, etc.\r\n\r\n3rd. He has proved by demonstration that the subdivision of matter\r\nunder different orders of progressive vibration evolves by such\r\nsubdivision entirely new and distinct elements, too multiple\r\nto enumerate. He has systematized the proper vibratory chords,\r\nprogressively, from the introductory molecular to the inter-etheric,\r\nembracing seven distinct orders of triple subdivision. He has\r\nelaborated a system of inducing sympathetic negative attraction on\r\nmetallic masses, with great range of motion, and instant depolarization\r\nof the same, by vibratory change of their neutral centres. Keely\r\ncontrols the transmission of these sympathetic streams by a medium\r\nof high molecular density, viz., drawn wires of differentiated\r\nmetals, gold, silver, platinum, German silver, etc. In some recent\r\nexperiments he took apart, for inspection of its interior construction,\r\nthe instrument which he has invented for the production of the force,\r\ncutting the wires with which he had operated in sympathetic attraction\r\nand propulsion, and distributing the fragments to those who were\r\npresent, among whom was Professor Leidy, to whom the Geological\r\nSociety of London has awarded the Lyell Medal, and the Academy of\r\nSciences of France the Cuvier Prize.\r\n\r\n4th. Keely has discovered that all sympathetic streams, cerebellic,\r\ngravital, magnetic, and electric, are composed of triple flows; this\r\nfact governing all the terrestrial and celestial orders of positive\r\nand negative radiation. In gravity it would be more correct to speak\r\nof triple connective links, as there is no flow of gravity.\r\n\r\n5th. Keely has discovered and was the first to demonstrate that\r\nelectricity has never been handled; that it is in principle as\r\nmaterial as is water; that it is not merely a force or a form of\r\nenergy,--that it is matter; and that what we call electricity,\r\nand have diverted for commercial use in electric lighting, is but\r\none of the triune currents, harmonic, enharmonic, and diatonic,\r\nwhich are united in pure electricity; that the enharmonic current\r\nseems to be sympathetically and mysteriously associated with the\r\ndominant current; and that the dominant current can no more be brought\r\nunder control than can the lightning itself. The diversion of the\r\ndominant current would mean destruction to any mechanical medium\r\nused for that purpose, and death to the operator. The intense heat\r\nevolved by the electric stream Keely attributes to the velocity of\r\nthe triple subdivision at the point of dispersion, as each triple\r\nseeks its medium of affinity. Sudden unition induces the same effect;\r\nbut demonstration shows that the concentration of this triple force\r\nis as free of percussion as is the breath of an infant against the\r\natmosphere; for the three currents flow together as in one stream, in\r\nthe mildest sympathetic way, while their discharge after concentration\r\nis, in comparison to their accumulation, as the tornado's force to\r\nthe waft of the butterfly's wing. The enharmonic current of this\r\ntriple stream, Keely thinks, carries with it the power of propulsion\r\nthat induces disturbance of negative equilibrium; which disturbance\r\nis essential to the co-ordination of its flow, in completing the,\r\ntriune stream of electricity. When this fluid is discharged from\r\nthe clouds, each triplet or third seeks its terrestrial concordant,\r\nthere to remain until that supreme law which governs disturbance\r\nof equilibrium again induces sympathetic concordant concentration,\r\ncontinuing to pass through its evolutions, positively and negatively,\r\nuntil the solar forces are expended.\r\n\r\n\"My researches have proved to me,\" writes Keely, \"the subtle and\r\npure conditions of the power of negative attraction and positive\r\npropulsion.\"\r\n\r\n6th. These same researches have enabled Keely to pronounce\r\ndefinitely as to the nature of what is recognized as gravity, an\r\never-existing, eternal force, coexistent with the compound etheric,\r\nor high luminous, entering into all forms of aggregated matter at\r\ntheir birth. Keely thinks that gravity is the source from which all\r\nvisible matter springs, and that the sympathetic or neutral centre of\r\nsuch aggregation becomes at birth a connective concordant link to all\r\nneutral centres that have preceded it and to all that may succeed it,\r\nand that disturbance of equilibrium, like gravity, is an ever-existing\r\nforce. His researches in the vibratory subdivision of matter have\r\nrevealed to him some of the mysteries of the hidden sympathetic\r\nworld, teaching that \"the visible world,\" as Coleridge wrote, \"is\r\nbut the clothing of the invisible world;\" that \"true philosophy,\"\r\nas Professor George Bush said, \"when reached will conduct us into the\r\nrealm of the spiritual as the true region of causes, disclosing new\r\nand unthought-of relations between the world of matter and of mind.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Thurston writes, in the January number of the North American\r\nReview, \"We are continually expecting to see a limit reached by the\r\ndiscoverer, and by the inventor, and are as constantly finding that\r\nwe are simply on a frontier which is being steadily pushed further\r\nand further out into the infinite unknown. The border-land is still\r\nahead of us, constantly enlarging as we move on. The more we gain,\r\nthe more is seen to be achievable.\"\r\n\r\nAll planetary masses Keely calls terrestrial, showing in his writings\r\nthat the beauty of the celestial concordant chords of sympathy\r\nforming the harmonious connective link, in what may be denominated\r\n\"the music of the spheres,\" is seen in the alternate oscillating range\r\nof motion between the planetary systems; for at a certain range of the\r\ngreater distance, harmony is established, and the attractive forces\r\nare brought into action, under the command, \"Thus far shalt thou go,\r\nand no further.\" Then in the return towards the neutral centres, when\r\nat the nearest point to each other, the opposite or propulsive force\r\nis brought into play; and \"thus near shalt thou come, and no nearer;\"\r\nadvancing and receding under the celestial law of etheric compensation\r\nand restoration, as originally established by the Great Creator.\r\n\r\n7th. Keely has constructed instruments by which he is endeavouring\r\nto determine the nature of the triune action of the polar terrestrial\r\nstream, or envelope, as regards its vibratory philosophy. He is seeking\r\nto demonstrate its sympathetic association with the celestial stream,\r\nor luminiferous track,--the compound etheric field, from which all\r\nplanetary masses spring. He considers the electric stream to be one\r\nof the triune sympathetic streams which help to build up, in their\r\norder of triple concentration, the high vitality of the polar stream,\r\nor, more correctly, the magnetic-electric terrestrial envelope,\r\nwithout which all living organisms would cease to exist. He classes\r\nthe cohesive force of molecular masses as the dominant order of the\r\nelectric stream, the molecule owing its negative attractive quality\r\nto the magnetic element.\r\n\r\nIn Keely's beautiful experiments in antagonizing the polar stream,\r\nrecently given before men of science, he has copied in his instruments\r\nthe conditions which Nature has established in all her terrestrial\r\nranges,--conditions necessary in order to equate a state of sympathetic\r\ndisturbance for the revitalization of what is continually being\r\ndisplaced by negative dispersion. These mechanical conditions are\r\nprincipally differential vibratory settings on molecular aggregations\r\nof the metallic masses of gold, silver, and platinum.\r\n\r\n8th. He has discovered that the range of molecular motion in all\r\nquiescent masses is equal to one-third of their diameters, and that\r\nall extended range is induced by sound-force, set at chords of the\r\nthirds which are antagonistic to the combined chords of the mass of\r\nthe neutral centres that they represent, no two masses being alike,\r\nand that at a certain increased range of molecular motion, induced by\r\nthe proper acoustic force, the molecules become repellent, and that\r\nwhen the sympathetic centres are influenced by a vibration concordant\r\nto the one that exists in themselves, the molecules become attractive;\r\nthat the repellent condition seems to take place at a distance of about\r\nten of the diameters of the molecules, this distance representing the\r\nneutral line of their attractive force, or the dividing line between\r\nthe attractive and the repellent. Beyond this line, perfect triple\r\nseparation takes place; inside of it, perfect attractive association\r\nis the result.\r\n\r\nThe force which Mr. Keely uses in running machinery is the sympathetic\r\nattractive,--the force which, according to his theories, draws the\r\nplanets together; while in his system of aërial navigation, should\r\nhe live to perfect it, he will use a negation of this force,--the\r\nsame that regulates the motion of the planets in their recession\r\nfrom each other. It is the sympathetic attractive force which keeps\r\nthe planets subservient to a certain range of motion, between their\r\noscillations. If this condition were broken up, the rotation of planets\r\nwould cease; if destroyed at a given point of recession, all planets\r\nwould become wanderers, like the comets; if destroyed at another given\r\npoint, assimilation would take place, as two bullets fired through\r\nthe air, meeting, would fuse into one mass. Nature has established her\r\nsympathetic concordants from the birth of the neutral centres of the\r\nplanets, in a manner known only to the Infinite One. This is gravity.\r\n\r\n\"The music of the spheres\" is a reality. \"The finer the power\r\nthe greater the force.\" Thus, the inaudible atomic, etheric, and\r\ninter-etheric sounds, which control and direct the harmony of the\r\nmovements of the celestial universe, are the most powerful of all\r\nsounds. If our faculty of hearing were a hundred billions of times\r\nintensified, we might be able to hear the streams of light as plainly\r\nas we now hear the sighings of the wind.\r\n\r\nAgain, to answer the often-asked question, \"What has Keely done?\"\r\n\r\n9th. He has broken joints of his fingers and thumbs, he has broken\r\nhis ribs, he has had his left side paralyzed for weeks, he has lost\r\nthe sight of one eye for months, in his hand-to-hand fight with the\r\ngenii that he has encountered, and cannot completely subdue until\r\nhe has effected the condition of polarization and depolarization\r\nwhich is necessary for the control of rotation and reversions in his\r\ncommercial engine. An illness of nine weeks followed his abandonment\r\nof water in disintegrating; and he was obliged to return to its use,\r\nto avoid the percussion that was induced by the rapid vibration of the\r\natmospheric air. To illustrate: if a bullet is fired at a man through\r\na vessel of water a foot thick, the bullet is flattened out without\r\ninjuring the man; while if nothing intervenes the man is killed.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, \"Are not the forces with which Keely\r\nis dealing of too subtle a nature to be harnessed to do the daily\r\nwork of the world?\" Even were it so, the fascination attendant upon\r\nhis researches would prevent him from abandoning them; but his faith\r\nin his ability to accomplish all that he has undertaken to do for the\r\nKeely Motor Company and for others is equalled only by the persistent\r\nenergy which, in the face of gigantic obstacles, of cruel obloquy, of\r\nbaffled endeavours, leads him to persevere to the end. He believes that\r\nthe successful result is as positive as are the continued revolutions\r\nof our globe, under the great law which governs all Nature's highest,\r\ngrandest, and most sensitive operations. And when has Nature ever\r\nrevealed a force save to permit man to subjugate it for the progress\r\nof our race?\r\n\r\nAnother question often heard is, \"Why does not Keely make known his\r\ndiscoveries?\"\r\n\r\n10th. He has written three treatises to explain his system, the titles\r\nof which are as follows:--\r\n\r\nI. Theoretical Exposé or Philosophical Analysis of Vibro-Molecular,\r\nVibro-Atomic, and Sympathetic Vibro-Etheric Forces, as applied to\r\ninduce Mechanical Rotation by Negative Sympathetic Attraction.\r\n\r\nII. Explanatory Analysis of Vibro-Acoustic Mechanism in all its\r\nDifferent Groupings or Combinations to induce Propulsion and Attraction\r\n(sympathetically) by the Power of Sound-Force; as also the Different\r\nConditions of Intensity, both Positive and Negative, on the Progressive\r\nOctaves to Ozonic Liberation and Luminosity.\r\n\r\nIII. The Determining Principle of Matter, or the Connective Link\r\nbetween the Finite and the Infinite, progressively considered from the\r\nCrude Molecular to the Compound Inter-Etheric; showing the Control of\r\nSpirit over Matter in all the Variations of Mass-Chords and Molecular\r\nGroupings, both Physical and Mechanical.\r\n\r\nIf these treatises were read from the first page to the last, by men\r\nof science, they would not at present be any better understood than\r\nwere Gilbert's writings in his age, author of \"De Magnete.\"\r\n\r\nNewton was indebted to Gilbert for his discovery of the so-called law\r\nof gravitation. Keely defines gravity as transmittive inter-etheric\r\nforce under immense etheric vibration, and electricity as a certain\r\nform of atomic vibration. When Gilbert, court-physician to Queen\r\nElizabeth, announced his discovery of electricity, he was asked by\r\nhis compeers of what use it was. No one dreamed then of it as a motive\r\npower. He replied, \"Of what use is a baby? It may develop into a man\r\nor a woman, and, although we cannot make any use of electricity now,\r\nthe world may in time find out uses for it.\" Just as little understood\r\nwould Keely's writings be now on sympathetic negative attraction as\r\nwere Gilbert's writings then on electricity and magnetism. Men found\r\nno sense in the words \"electric\" and \"electricity,\" although derived\r\nfrom the Greek root for amber. The same fault is found with Keely\r\nfor coining new words which no one understands.\r\n\r\n\"Every branch of science, every doctrine of extensive application,\r\nhas had its alphabet, its rudiments, its grammar: at each fresh step in\r\nthe path of discovery the researcher has had to work out by experiment\r\nthe unknown laws which govern his discovery.\" To attempt to introduce\r\n\"the world\"--even scientists--to any new system without previous\r\npreparation would be like giving a Persian book to a man to read who\r\nknew nothing of the language. As has been said, we do not expect a\r\ncomplicated problem in the higher mathematical analysis to be solved\r\nby one who is ignorant of the elementary rules of arithmetic. Just as\r\nuseless would it be to expect every scientist to comprehend the laws\r\nof etheric physics and etheric philosophy after having witnessed\r\nKeely's experiments. The requirement of every demonstration is\r\nthat it shall give sufficient proof of the truth that it asserts. A\r\ndemonstration which does less than this cannot be relied upon, and no\r\ndemonstration ever made has done more. The success of a demonstration\r\nis in proportion as the means applied are adequate or inadequate. As\r\ndifferent principles exist in various forms of matter, it is quite\r\nimpossible to demonstrate every truth by the same means or the same\r\nprinciples. It is only the prejudice of ignorance which exacts that\r\nevery demonstration shall be given by a prescribed canon of science;\r\nas if the science of the present were thoroughly conversant with\r\nevery principle that exists in nature. Yet physicists exact this,\r\nthough they must know its inadequacy.\r\n\r\nMr. Keely does not expect more from scientists than that they should\r\nwithhold their defamatory opinions of him until they have witnessed\r\nhis demonstrations and acquainted themselves with his theories. Yet,\r\nnotwithstanding Professor Crooke's psychical researches and Professor\r\nRücker's experiments in molecular vibration, demonstrating that\r\nmolecules seem to have a \"mental attribute, a sort of expression of\r\nfree will,\" physicists still look upon the human organism as little\r\nmore than a machine, taking small interest in experiments which evince\r\nthe dominion of spirit over matter. Keely's researches in this province\r\nhave shown him that it is neither the electric nor the magnetic flow,\r\nbut the etheric, which sends its current along our nerves; that the\r\nelectric and magnetic flows bear but an infinitely small ratio to the\r\netheric flow, both as to velocity and tenuity; that true coincidents\r\ncan exist between any mediums,--cartilage to steel, steel to wood,\r\nwood to stone, and stone to cartilage; that the same influence,\r\nsympathetic association, which governs all the solids holds the same\r\ncontrol over all liquids, and again from liquid to solid, embracing\r\nthe three kingdoms, animal, vegetable, and mineral; that the action of\r\nmind over matter thoroughly substantiates the incontrovertible laws of\r\nsympathetic etheric influence; that the only true medium which exists\r\nin nature is the sympathetic flow emanating from the normal human\r\nbrain, governing correctly the graduating and setting-up of the true\r\nsympathetic vibratory positions in machinery, necessary to commercial\r\nsuccess; that these flows come in on the order of the fifth and seventh\r\npositions of atomic subdivision, compound inter-etheric sympathy a\r\nresultant of this subdivision; that if metallic mediums are brought\r\nunder the influence of this sympathetic flow they become organisms\r\nwhich carry the same influence with them that the human brain does\r\nover living physical positions, and that the composition of metallic\r\nand that of physical organisms are one and the same thing, although\r\nthe molecular arrangement of the physical may be entirely opposite\r\nto the metallic on their aggregations; that the harmonious chords\r\ninduced by sympathetic positive vibration permeate the molecules in\r\neach, notwithstanding, and bring about the perfect equation of any\r\ndifferentiation that may exist--in one the same as in the other--and\r\nthus they become one and the same medium for sympathetic transmission;\r\nthat the etheric, or will-flow, is of a tenuity coincident to the\r\ncondition governing the seventh subdivision of matter, a condition\r\nof subtlety that readily and instantaneously permeates all forms of\r\naggregated matter, from air to solid hammered steel, the velocity\r\nof the permeation being the same with the one as with the other;\r\nthat the tenuity of the etheric flow is so infinitely fine that a\r\nmagnifying glass, the power of which would enlarge the smallest grain\r\nof sand to the size of the sun, brought to bear upon it would not\r\nmake its structure visible to us; and that, light traversing space\r\nat the speed of two hundred thousand miles per second, a distance\r\nrequiring light a thousand centuries to reach would be traversed by\r\nthe etheric flow in an indefinite fragment of a second.\r\n\r\n11th. Keely has given such proof of genius as should bring all\r\nscientists who approach him into that attitude of mind which would\r\nlead them to receive without prejudice the evidence of the truth of\r\nthe claims he offers.\r\n\r\nGenius has been defined as an extraordinary power of synthetic\r\ncreation. Another definition of the man of genius is, the man who\r\nunceasingly cultivates and perfects such great natural aptitudes\r\nand facilities as he has been endowed with at his birth. No man has\r\never lived on this earth who, according to these qualifications,\r\nso deserved to be known and acknowledged as a man of genius as John\r\nWorrell Keely. History will determine whether he is a man of genius or\r\n\"a charlatan,\" as some scientists still persist in calling him. It is\r\neasier, as has been said, to accuse a man of fraud than to account\r\nfor unknown phenomena. A system of doctrine can be legitimately\r\nrefuted only upon its own principles, viz., by disproving its facts\r\nand invalidating the principles deduced from them. Abercrombie said\r\nthat the necessary caution which preserves us from credulity should\r\nnot be allowed to engender scepticism,--that both of these extremes\r\nare equally unworthy of a mind which devotes itself with candour to\r\nthe discovery of truth.\r\n\r\n\"We must not decide that a thing is impossible,\" says Lebrun, \"because\r\nof the common belief that it cannot exist; for the opinion of man\r\ncannot set limits to the operations of Nature, nor to the power of\r\nthe Almighty. He who attempts to hold up to contempt a scientific\r\nsubject of which he is profoundly ignorant has but small pretensions\r\nto the character of a philosopher.\" Galileo said, after pronouncing\r\nhis abjuration, \"E pur si muove\" (\"But it does move\"). What signified\r\nto him the opinion of men, when Nature confirmed his discovery? Of\r\nwhat value were their prejudices or their wisdom in opposition to her\r\nimmutable laws? Kedzie, speculating upon the nature of force, writes,\r\n\"Molecules and masses act precisely as they are acted on; they are\r\ngoverned by the iron instead of the golden rule. They do unto others as\r\nothers have done unto them. Whence comes this energy? Not from atoms,\r\nbut from the Creator, in the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll says, \"We know nothing of the ultimate seat of\r\nforce. Science, in the modern doctrine of the conservation of energy\r\nand the convertibility of forces, is already getting something like\r\na firm hold of the idea that all kinds of forces are but forms\r\nor manifestations of some one central force, arising from one\r\nfountain-head of power.\"\r\n\r\n12th. Keely's researches have taught him that this one fountain-head\r\nis none other than the omnipotent and all-pervading Will-Force\r\nof the Almighty, which creates, upholds, guides, and governs the\r\nuniverse. \"The whole world-process,\"  says Von Hartmann, \"in its\r\ncontext is only a logical process; but in its existence it is a\r\ncontinued act of will.\"\r\n\r\nLilly says, \"This is what physical law means. Reason and will are\r\ninseparably united in the universe as they are in idea. If we will\r\nanything, it is for some reason. In contemplating the structure\r\nof the universe, we cannot resist the conclusion that the whole is\r\nfounded upon a distinct idea.\" Keely holds to the harmony of this\r\n\"distinct idea\" throughout creation, and he demonstrates by vibratory\r\nmachinery that all forces are indestructible, immaterial, homogeneous\r\nentities, having their origin and unity in one great intelligent\r\npersonal will-force.\r\n\r\nWere it not for this will-force eternally flowing into all created\r\nforms, the entire universe would disappear. As the workman employs\r\nhis instrument to accomplish his designs, so Omnipotence may be said,\r\nin all reverence, to regulate His systems of worlds through and by\r\nthe vibratory ether which He has created to serve His purpose. Well\r\ndid Hertz reason when he wrote, \"Soon the question set by modern\r\nphysics will be, 'Are not all things due to conditions of ether?'\" He\r\nhad never heard of the toiler on this side of the Atlantic, when,\r\nafter his own discovery, in 1888, that ether was imprisoned and\r\nused in every electro-magnetic engine, without this fact having\r\nbeen even so much as suspected by a single scientist, he wrote, in\r\nthe Revue Scientifique, \"We have gained a greater height than ever,\r\nand we possess a solid basis which will facilitate the ascent, in the\r\nresearch of new truths. The road which is open to us is not too steep,\r\nand the next resting-point does not appear inaccessible. Moreover,\r\nthe crowds of researchers are full of ardour. We must therefore welcome\r\nwith confidence all the efforts that are being made in this direction.\"\r\n\r\nKeely has found no \"resting-point\" in his researches of a\r\nlifetime; and, instead of being \"welcomed with confidence\" by his\r\nfellow-researchers in science, he has suffered at their hands more\r\nthan will ever be known by his detractors. Keely's discoveries would\r\nhave died with him, through the calumnies of these same scientists,\r\nas far as demonstration was concerned, had not a company been formed,\r\nin the early days of his inventions, which for many years furnished\r\nhim with the necessary funds, expecting almost immediate financial\r\nsuccess. The sneers of men of science crying \"Charlatan,\" the\r\nridicule of the public press, and the denunciations of the ignorant\r\nhave been mighty factors in debasing the value of the shares of the\r\ncompany. The courage, faith, and contributing capacity of nearly\r\nall the stockholders have given out; and it is fortunate that now\r\nMr. Keely's work of evolution has at last reached the point where\r\nhe is able to convince those scientists of his integrity whose minds\r\nare broad enough to conform to what Herbert Spencer has said is the\r\nfirst condition of success in scientific research,--viz. \"an honest\r\nreceptivity, and willingness to abandon all preconceived notions,\r\nhowever cherished, if they be found to contradict the truth.\"\r\n\r\nKeely may be said to have spent years of his valuable time in giving\r\nexhibitions whereby to raise the funds needed for his scientific\r\nresearches. Again and again has he taken apart his various machines,\r\nto show their interior construction to the sceptical; and what this\r\nmeans, in the attendant delay, will be better understood when he has\r\nmade known how slight a thing, by the laws of sympathetic association,\r\nmay retard his progress for days, even for weeks.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, his last experience with his preliminary commercial\r\nengine, to which, before he had completed his graduation, he was\r\ninduced, in November 1889, to apply a brake, to show what resistance\r\nthe vibratory current could bear under powerful friction. A force\r\nsufficient to stop a train of cars, it was estimated, did not interfere\r\nwith its running; but under additional strain a \"thud\" was heard,\r\nand the shaft of the engine was twisted.\r\n\r\nThe engine should not have been submitted to such a test until\r\nafter the differentiation had been equated, and perfect control\r\nin reversions established. And yet, so often has Keely made what\r\nseemed to be disasters an advantage in the end, it is possible that\r\nthe interruption and delay may enable him to produce a perfect engine\r\nsooner than he would have done on this model. The world will never know\r\nhow many mechanical difficulties Keely has conquered before attaining\r\nhis present degree of success, in which he thinks he has mastered all\r\nthat pertains to the principle of the force that he is dealing with,\r\nso far as necessary for commercial purposes, the difficulties that he\r\nstill has to contend with being merely the minor ones of mechanical\r\ndetail. The fact that so much of Mr. Keely's success, in conducting\r\nhis experiments when giving exhibitions, depends upon the complete\r\nperfection of his instruments, is one of the strongest arguments that\r\ncould be advanced in proof of the genuineness of his claims. Has any\r\none ever heard of a performer in legerdemain who, after assembling an\r\naudience to witness his tricks, announced that something was wrong\r\nwith his conjuring apparatus and that he was unable to exhibit his\r\ndexterity? Feats of legerdemain can be performed, night after night,\r\nyear in and year out, without any hitch on the part of the operator;\r\nbut all who are conversant with the failures attendant upon a certain\r\norder of experiments, as for instance in the liquefying of oxygen gas,\r\nwill be able to appreciate the uncertainty which characterizes the\r\naction of Mr. Keely's instruments at times.\r\n\r\nIt is only by progressive experimental research that knowledge of\r\nthe laws governing Nature's operations can be gained, and a system\r\nevolved to perpetuate such knowledge. The hypothesis of to-day must\r\nbe discarded to-morrow, if further research proves its fallacy. Is\r\nit not, then, another strong argument in favour of Keely's integrity\r\nthat, confessing ignorance of the laws that govern the force he has\r\ndiscovered, he has plodded on through all these years, experimenting\r\nupon its nature, with instruments of his own invention, which from\r\ntheir delicate and imperfect construction are uncertain in their\r\noperations, until he has so improved the defective machine as to make\r\nit a stepping-stone, by which he ascends to perfection? Take the\r\nimperfect comparison of a ladder: no workman can attain the summit\r\nin one effort; he must mount step by step.\r\n\r\nTo quote from Keely's writings, \"The mathematics of vibratory etheric\r\nscience, both pure and applied, require long and arduous research. It\r\nseems to me that no man's life is long enough to cover more than the\r\nintroductory branch. The theory of elliptic functions, the calculus\r\nof probabilities, are but pygmies in comparison to a science which\r\nrequires the utmost tension of the human mind to grasp. But let us wait\r\npatiently for the light that will come, that is even now dawning.\" [10]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May, 1889, Mr. Keely's workshop was visited by\r\nseveral men interested to see and judge for themselves of the\r\nnature of his researches. Among them were Professor Leidy, of\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania, and James M. Willcox, author of\r\n\"Elemental Philosophy.\" After seeing the experiments in acoustics,\r\nand the production, storage, and discharge of the ether, Mr. Willcox\r\nremarked that no one who had witnessed all that they had seen in\r\nthe line of associative vibration, under the same advantages, could\r\nassert any fraud on the part of Keely without convicting himself of\r\nthe rankest folly. These gentlemen met Mr. Keely with their minds open\r\nto conviction, though with strong prejudices against the discovery\r\nof any unknown force. They treated him as if he were all that he\r\nis, keeping out of sight whatever doubts they may have had of the\r\ngenuineness of his claims as a discoverer; and, in the end, all who\r\nwere present expressed their appreciation of his courtesy in answering\r\nthe questions asked, and their admiration of what he has accomplished\r\non his unknown path. In doing this, they were simply doing justice\r\nto him and to themselves,--to that self-respect which leads men to\r\nrespect the rights of others, and to do unto others as they would be\r\ndone by. Had they questioned Keely's integrity, or betrayed doubts of\r\nhis honesty of purpose, he would at once have assumed the defensive,\r\nand would have informed them that he has no wish to conduct experiments\r\nfor scientists who are ready to give their opinions of his theories\r\nbefore having heard them propounded, or of his experiments before\r\nwitnessing them. When Keely's system of \"sympathetic vibration\"\r\nis made known (\"sympathetic seeking\" Mr. Willcox would call it),\r\nit will be seen how sensitive Mr. Keely's instruments are to the\r\nvibrations caused by street-noises, to vibrations of air from talking\r\nin the operating room, to touch even, as well as why it is that,\r\nalthough he is willing to take apart and explain the construction\r\nof his instruments in the presence of investigators, he objects to\r\nhaving them handled by others than himself, after they have been\r\n\"harmonized,\" or \"sensitized,\" or \"graduated.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Keely is his own worst enemy. When suspected of fraud he acts\r\nas if he were a fraud; and in breaking up his vibratory microscope\r\nand other instruments which he had been years in perfecting, at\r\nthe time he was committed to prison in 1888, he laid himself open\r\nto the suspicion that his instruments are but devices with which he\r\ncunningly deceives his patrons. Yet these same instruments he has,\r\nsince their reconstruction, dissected and explained to those who\r\napproached him in the proper spirit. It is only when he has been\r\nsubjected to insulting suspicions by arrogant scientists that he\r\nrefuses to explain his theories, and to demonstrate their truth,\r\nas far as it is in his power to do so. \"Keely may be on the right\r\ntrack, after all,\" remarked an English scientist, after Prof. Hertz\r\nhad made known his researches on the structure of ether; \"for if we\r\nhave imprisoned the ether without knowing it, why may not Keely know\r\nwhat he has got a hold of?\"\r\n\r\nNorman Lockyer, in his \"Chemistry of the Sun,\" confirms Keely's\r\ntheories when he writes, \"The law which connects radiation with\r\nabsorption and at once enables us to read the riddle set by the sun\r\nand stars is, then, simply the law of 'sympathetic vibration.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is remarkable,\" says Horace W. Smith, \"that in countries far\r\ndistant from each other, different men have fallen into the same tracks\r\nof science, and have made similar and correspondent discoveries,\r\nat the same period of time, without the least communication with\r\neach other.\" So has it been in all periods of progress and in all\r\nbranches of science, from the discoveries of Euclid and Archimedes\r\ndown to those of Galileo and Descartes and Bacon, and, in later days,\r\nof Gilbert and Newton and Leibnitz, then Franklin and Collison and\r\nVon Kliest and Muschenbröck; and now Keely and Hertz and Depuy and\r\nRücker and Lockyer are examples. Never has a discovery leading to\r\na new system been begun and perfected by the same individual so far\r\nas Keely is doing; but, as Morley has said, \"the representative of\r\na larger age must excel in genius all predecessors.\"\r\n\r\nThe application of his discovery to the service of humanity is the\r\naim and end of Keely's efforts; his success means \"vastly more than\r\nthe most sanguine to-day venture to predict,\" promising \"a true\r\nmillennial introduction into the unseen universe, and the glorious\r\nlife that every man, Christian or sceptic, optimist or pessimist,\r\nwould gladly hope for and believe possible.\" (Thurston.)\r\n\r\nNot the least among the ultimate blessings to our race which Keely's\r\ndiscovery foreshadows is the deeper insight that it will bestow into\r\nthe healing power of the finer forces of nature, embracing cures of\r\nbrain and nerve disorders that are now classed with incurable diseases.\r\n\r\nOnly a partial answer has been given to the question, \"What has Keely\r\ndone for science?\" But enough has been said to convey some idea of\r\nthe subtle nature of the force he is dealing with, and of the cause\r\nof the delays which have again and again disappointed the inventor,\r\nas well as the too sanguine hopes of immediate commercial success\r\nwhich have animated the officers and stockholders of \"The Keely Motor\r\nCompany.\" Keely has no secret to wrest from him. Instead of \"Keely's\r\nSecret,\" it should be called \"Nature's Secret;\" for the problem has\r\nstill to be worked out, the solution of which will make it \"Keely's\r\nSecret;\" and until this problem is fully solved to the inventor's\r\nsatisfaction for commercial application, Keely has no secret that he\r\nis not willing to disclose, as far as it is in his power to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nVIBRATORY PHYSICS.--TRUE SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n        We seem to be approaching a theory as to the construction\r\n        of ether. Hertz has produced vibrations, vibrating more\r\n        than one hundred million times per second. He made use of\r\n        the principle of resonance. You all understand how, by a\r\n        succession of well-timed small impulses, a large vibration\r\n        may be set up.--Prof. Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Schimmel, in his lecture on \"The Unity of Nature's Forces,\"\r\nsays:--\"The Greek philosophers, Leucippus, Anaxagoras, Democritus,\r\nand Aristotle, base their philosophies on the existence of an ether\r\nand atoms.\" According to Spiller's system, \"both ether and atoms are\r\nmaterial. The atoms are indivisible. Chemistry, being based on the\r\ncorrectness of this statement, forces us to accept it.\" But we are\r\nnot forced to accept it if it is proved to be false.\r\n\r\nKeely has now reached a stage in his researches at which he is able\r\nto demonstrate the truth of the hypotheses which he is formulating\r\ninto a system; and consequently the stage where he can demonstrate\r\nwhether theories, that have prevailed concerning the cause of physical\r\nphenomena, are sound or without basis in fact. Until this stage was\r\nreached it would have been as useless to make Mr. Keely's theories\r\nknown, as it would be to publish a treatise to prove that two and two\r\nmake five. Scientific men reject all theories in physics in which there\r\nis not an equal proportion of science and mathematics, excluding all\r\nquestions of pure metaphysics. They are right; for, until the world\r\nhad undergone a state of preparation for another revelation of truth,\r\nthe man who demonstrated all that Keely is now prepared to demonstrate\r\nwould have been burned alive as a wizard. To use the words of Babcock,\r\none of Keely's staunchest adherents, in 1880:--\"This discoverer has\r\nentered a new world, and although an unexplored region of untold wealth\r\nlies beyond, he is treading firmly its border, which daily widens\r\nas with ever-increasing interest he pursues his explorations. He has\r\npassed the dreary realm where scientists are groping. His researches\r\nare made in the open field of elemental force, where gravity, inertia,\r\ncohesion, momentum, are disturbed in their haunts and diverted to use;\r\nwhere, from unity of origin, emanates infinite energy in diversified\r\nforms,\" and, to this statement I would add--where he is able to\r\nlook from nature up to nature's God, understanding and explaining,\r\nas no man before ever understood and explained, how simple is \"the\r\nmysterious way in which God works His wonders to perform.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Babcock continues:--\"Human comprehension is inadequate to grasp the\r\npossibilities of this discovery for power, for increased prosperity,\r\nand for peace. It includes all that relates mechanically to travel,\r\nmanufacture, mining, engineering, and warfare.\" Up to within two\r\nyears, Keely, this discoverer of unknown laws of nature, has been left\r\npartially to the mercy of men who were interested only in mechanical\r\n\"possibilities.\" In the autumn of 1888, he was led into a line of\r\nresearch which made the mechanical question one of secondary interest;\r\nand yet the present results are such as to prove that on this line\r\nalone can he ever hope to attain commercial success. The course then\r\nadopted has also been the means of placing his discoveries before\r\nthe world, endorsed in such a manner as to command attention to his\r\nviews and theories. It has been said that if extreme vicissitudes of\r\nbelief on the part of men of science are evidences of uncertainty,\r\nit may be affirmed that of all kinds of knowledge none is more\r\nuncertain than science. The only hope for science is more science,\r\nsays Drummond. Keely now bestows the only hope for science--\"more\r\nscience.\" He accounts for the non-recognition by scientists of\r\nhis claims, in these words: \"The system of arranging introductory\r\netheric impulses by compound chords set by differential harmonies,\r\nis one that the world of science has never recognized, simply\r\nbecause the struggles of physicists, combating with the solution of\r\nthe conditions governing the fourth order of matter, have been in a\r\ndirection thoroughly antagonistic, and opposite to a right one. It is\r\ntrue that luminosity has been induced by chemical antagonism, and,\r\nin my mind, this ought to have been a stepping-stone towards a more\r\nperfect condition than was accepted by them; but independent of what\r\nmight be necessary to its analysis, the bare truth remains that the\r\nconditions were isolated--robbed of their most vital essentials--by\r\nnot having the medium of etheric vibration associated with them.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to subdivide the atoms in the atomic triplet, the molecular\r\nether, liberated from the molecule, is absolutely necessary to effect\r\nthe rupture of the atoms; and so on, progressively, in each order of\r\nether, molecular, inter-molecular, atomic, inter-atomic, etheric,\r\ninter-etheric, the ether liberated in each successive division is\r\nessential to the next subdivision.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of Mr. Keely's researches is that the movements of elastic\r\nelements are rhythmical, and before he had reached his present stage\r\nin producing vibrations, on the principle of resonance, he has had\r\nproblems to solve which needed the full measure of inspiration or\r\napperception that he has received.\r\n\r\nHertz has produced vibrations about one metre long, vibrating more\r\nthan one hundred million times a second. Keely has produced, using\r\nan atmospheric medium alone, 519,655,633 vibrations per second; but,\r\ninterposing pure hydrogen gas between soap films and using it as a\r\nmedium of acceleration, he asserts that on the enharmonic third a rate\r\nof vibration may be induced which could not be set down in figures,\r\nand could only be represented in sound colours. He has invented\r\ninstruments which demonstrate in many variations the colours of\r\nsound, registering the number of necessary vibrations to produce each\r\nvariation. The transmissive sympathetic chord of B flat, third octave,\r\nwhen passing into inaudibility, would induce billions of billions\r\nof vibrations, represented by sound colour on a screen illuminated\r\nfrom a solar ray. But this experiment is one of infinite difficulty,\r\nfrom the almost utter impossibility of holding the hydrogen between\r\nthe two films long enough to conduct the experiment. Keely made over\r\n1200 trials before succeeding once in inducing the intense blue field\r\nnecessary, covering a space of six weeks, four hours at a time daily;\r\nand should he ever succeed in his present efforts to produce a film\r\nthat will stand, he anticipates being able to register the range of\r\nmotion in all metallic mediums. On this subject Keely writes:--The\r\nhighest range of vibration I ever induced was in the one experiment\r\nthat I made in liberating ozone by molecular percussion, which\r\ninduced luminosity, and registered a percussive molecular force of\r\n110,000 lbs. per square inch, as registered on a lever constructed\r\nfor the purpose. The vibrations induced by this experiment reached\r\nover 700,000,000 per second, unshipping the apparatus, thus making it\r\ninsecure for a repetition of the experiments. The decarbonized steel\r\ncompressors of said apparatus moved as if composed of putty. Volume\r\nof sphere, 15 cubic inches; weight of surrounding metal, 316 lbs.\r\n\r\nRecently some questions, propounded to Mr. Keely by a scientist,\r\nelicited answers which the man of science admitted were clear and\r\ndefinite, but no physicist could accept Keely's assertion that\r\nincalculable amounts of latent force exist in the molecular spaces,\r\nfor the simple reason that science asserts that molecular aggregation\r\nis attended with dissipation of energy instead of its absorption. The\r\nquestions asked were:--\r\n\r\nI. \"In disintegrating water, how many foot-pounds of energy have you\r\nto expend in order to produce or induce the vibratory energy in your\r\nacoustical apparatus?\"\r\n\r\nAnswer.--\"No foot-pounds at all. The force necessary to excite\r\ndisintegration when the instrument is sensitized, both in sensitization\r\nand developments, would not be sufficient to wind up a watch.\"\r\n\r\nII. \"What is the amount of energy that you get out of that initial\r\namount of water, say twelve drops, when decomposed into ether?\"\r\n\r\nAnswer.--\"From twelve drops of water a force can be developed that\r\nwill fill a chamber of seven pint volume no less than six times with\r\na pressure of ten tons to the square inch.\"\r\n\r\nIII. \"In other words, if you put so many pounds of energy into\r\nvibratory motion, how many foot-pounds do you get out of this?\"\r\n\r\nAnswer.--\"All molecular masses of metal represent in their interstitial\r\nmolecular spaces incalculable amounts of latent force, which, if\r\nawakened and brought into intense vibratory action by the medium of\r\nsympathetic liberation, would result in thousands of billions more\r\npower in foot-pounds than that necessary to awaken it. The resultant\r\ndevelopment of any and all forces is only accomplished by conditions\r\nthat awaken the latent energy they have carried with them during\r\nmolecular aggregation. If the latent force that exists in a pound of\r\nwater could be sympathetically evolved or liberated up to the seventh\r\nsubdivision or compound inter-etheric, and could be stored free of\r\nrotation, it would be in my estimation sufficient to run the power\r\nof the world for a century.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement gives another of Keely's discoveries to the world,\r\nviz., that molecular dissociation does not create energy, as men\r\nhave asserted Keely has claimed, but supplies it in unlimited\r\nquantities, as the product of the latent energy accumulated in\r\nmolecular aggregation. This is to the physicist as if Keely had\r\nasserted that two and two make a billion, but as a man of science,\r\nwho is held to be \"the scientific equal of any man in the world,\"\r\nhas come forward to make known that, in his opinion, \"Keely has fairly\r\ndemonstrated the discovery of a force previously unknown to science,\"\r\nthe discoverer at lasts feels at liberty to make public the nature of\r\nhis discoveries. Until Dr. Joseph Leidy had taken this stand, Mr. Keely\r\ncould not, without jeopardizing his interests, and the interests\r\nof the Keely Motor Company, have made known in what particulars his\r\nsystem conflicts with the systems upheld by the age in which we live.\r\n\r\nAfter the warning given in the history of Huxley's \"Bathybius,\"\r\nwe may feel quite sure that if Keely had failed to demonstrate the\r\ngenuineness of his claims by actual experiment, no scientist would\r\nhave risked the world-wide reputation of a lifetime by endorsement of\r\nthe discovery of an unknown force, as Professor Leidy has done, while\r\nKeely himself was under such a cloud that, to advocate his integrity\r\nand uphold the importance of his discovery, has hitherto been enough\r\nto awaken doubts as to the sanity of his upholders. Among many others\r\nwho have written of it from the standpoint of Keely's accountability\r\nfor the mistakes of the managers of the Keely Motor Company--men who\r\nmade no pretence of caring for anything but dividends--was one who\r\nasserted, in the New York Tribune, that it was a \"remarkable delusion,\r\nfull of tricks too numerous to mention, the exposure of which ought\r\nto be made to bring the Keely craze to an end.\" In the same journal\r\nan editorial states that \"Mr. Keely appears to have no mechanical\r\ningenuity, his strong point being his ability as a collector. He has\r\none of the largest and best arranged collections of other people's\r\nmoney to be found in the United States. Having, a number of years ago,\r\nduring a fit of temporary insanity, constructed a machine which, if any\r\npower on earth could start it, would explode and pierce the startled\r\ndome of heaven with flying fragments of cog-wheels and cranks, he now\r\nsits down calmly, and allows this same mechanical nightmare to make\r\nhis living for him. This is genius; this is John W. Keely; he toils\r\nnot, neither does he spin, but he has got an hysterical collection\r\nof crooked pipes and lob-sided wheels tied up in his back room that\r\nextract the reluctant dollar from the pocket of avarice without fail.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a specimen of the nature of the ridicule which was encountered\r\nby Keely's \"upholders,\" as well as by himself. Until Professor Leidy\r\nand Dr. Willcox came to the front, in March, 1890, Mr. Keely had no\r\ninfluential supporters, and not one scientist could be found who was\r\nready to encounter the wasps.\r\n\r\nSuch is the position of all defenders of the truth in all ages;\r\nbut the torch being held aloft, in such hands as have now seized it,\r\nthe opportunity is given to see what Keely proclaims as truth.\r\n\r\nWe know that science denies the divisibility of atoms, but Keely\r\naffirms and demonstrates that all corpuscules of matter may be divided\r\nand subdivided by a certain order of vibration. During all these years\r\nin which he has given exhibitions of the operation of his generators,\r\nliberators, and disintegrators, in turn, each being an improvement,\r\nsuccessively, on the preceding one, no one has attempted to give\r\nto the public any theory, or even so much as a sensible conjecture,\r\nof the origin of the force.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Keely was asked, by a woman in 1884, if it were not possible\r\nthat he had dissociated hydrogen gas, and that his unknown force\r\ncame from that dissociation, he replied that he thought it might be;\r\nbut he made no assertion that he had. This conjecture was repeated to\r\nan English scientist, who replied that he was willing to make a bet\r\nof 10,000l. that hydrogen is a simple element. The same scientist\r\nsays now that he should answer such a question with more caution,\r\nand say that he had never known hydrogen to be dissociated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory and Formula of Aqueous Disintegration.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar conditions as associated with the gaseous elements of\r\nwhich water is composed, as regards the differential volume and gravity\r\nof its gases, make it a ready and fit subject of vibratory research. In\r\nsubmitting water to the influence of vibratory transmission, even on\r\nsimple thirds, the high action induced on the hydrogen as contrasted\r\nwith the one on the oxygen (under the same vibratory stream), causes\r\nthe antagonism between these elements that induces dissociation. The\r\ndifferential antagonistic range of motion, so favouring the\r\nantagonistic thirds as to become thoroughly repellent. The gaseous\r\nelement thus induced and registered, shows thousands of times much\r\ngreater force as regards tenuity and volume than that induced by the\r\nchemical disintegration of heat, on the same medium. In all molecular\r\ndissociation or disintegration of both simple or compound elements,\r\nwhether gaseous or solid, a stream of vibratory antagonistic thirds,\r\nsixths, or ninths, on their chord mass will compel progressive\r\nsubdivisions. In the disintegration of water the instrument is set\r\non thirds, sixths, and ninths, to get the best effects. These triple\r\nconditions are focalized on the neutral centre of said instrument\r\nso as to induce perfect harmony or concordance to the chord-note of\r\nthe mass-chord of the instrument's full combination; after which the\r\ndiatonic and the enharmonic scale located at the top of the instrument,\r\nor ring, is thoroughly harmonized with the scale of ninths which is\r\nplaced at the base of the vibratory transmitter with the telephone\r\nhead. The next step is to disturb the harmony on the concentrative\r\nthirds, between the transmitter and disintegrator. This is done\r\nby rotating the syren so as to induce a sympathetic communication\r\nalong the nodal transmitter, or wire, that associates the two\r\ninstruments. When the note of the syren becomes concordant to the\r\nneutral centre of the disintegrator, the highest order of sympathetic\r\ncommunication is established. It is now necessary to operate the\r\ntransferable vibratory negatizer, or negative accelerator, which is\r\nseated in the centre of the diatonic and enharmonic ring, at the top\r\nof disintegrator, and complete disintegration will follow (from the\r\nantagonisms induced on the concordants by said adjunct), in triple\r\nprogression, thus:--First, thirds: Molecular dissociation resolving the\r\nwater into a gaseous compound of hydrogen and oxygen. Second, sixths:\r\nresolving the hydrogen and oxygen into a new element by second order\r\nof dissociation, producing what I call, low atomic ether. Third,\r\nninths: The low atomic ether resolved into a new element, which I\r\ndenominate high or second atomic harmonic. All these transmissions\r\nbeing simultaneous on the disturbance of sympathetic equilibrium by\r\nsaid negative accelerator.\r\n\r\nExample:--Taking the chord mass of the disintegrator B flat, or any\r\nchord mass that may be represented by the combined association of\r\nall the mechanical parts of its structure (no two structures being\r\nalike in their chord masses), taking B flat, the resonators of said\r\nstructure are set at B flat first octave, B flat third octave, and\r\nB flat ninth octave, by drawing out the caps of resonators until\r\nthe harmony of thirds, sixths, and ninths are reached; which a\r\nsimple movement of the fingers on the diatonic scale, at the head,\r\nwill determine by the tremulous action which is highly sensible to\r\nthe touch, on said caps. The caps are then rigidly fixed in their\r\ndifferent positions by set screws. The focalization to the neutral\r\ncentre is then established by dampening the steel rods, on the scale\r\nat the back, representing the thirds, sixths, and ninths, drawing a\r\npiece of small gum tube over them, which establishes harmony to the\r\nchord mass of the instrument. Concordance is thus effected between\r\nthe disintegrator and the ninths of the scale at base of transmitters\r\nwith telephonic head.\r\n\r\nThis scale has a permanent sympathetic one, set on the ninth of\r\nany mass chord that may be represented, on any and all the multiple\r\nvariations of mechanical combinations. In fact, permanently set for\r\nuniversal accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to establish pure harmony between the transmitter\r\nand the disintegrator, which is done by spinning the syren disk,\r\nthen waiting until the sympathetic note is reached, as the syren\r\nchord, decreasing in velocity, descends the scale. At this juncture,\r\nthe negative accelerator must be immediately and rapidly rotated,\r\ninducing high disturbance of equilibrium between the transmitter\r\nand the disintegrator by triple negative evolution, with the result\r\nthat a force of from five to ten, fifteen, twenty, and thirty thousand\r\npounds to the square inch is evolved by the focalization of this triple\r\nnegative stream on the disintegrating cell, or chamber, whether there\r\nbe one, two, three, five, or ten drops of water enclosed within it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduation of Machines.\r\n\r\nMr. Keely gives a few introductory words concerning the necessary\r\ngraduating of his instruments, for effecting conditions necessary to\r\nensure perfect sympathetic transmission, which will serve to show how\r\ngreat are the difficulties that have been attendant upon getting his\r\nmachines into a condition to control and equate the differentiation\r\nin molecular masses, requiring greater skill than in researching\r\nthe force of a sunbeam. He writes:--The differentiation in molecular\r\nmetallic masses, or grouping, is brought about in their manipulations\r\nin manufacturing them for commercial uses; in the forging of a piece\r\nof metal, in the drawing of a length of wire, and in the casting of\r\na molten mass to any requisite form.\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to molecular uniformity in metallic masses is in\r\nthe wire drawn for commercial uses, gold and platina being the nearest\r\nto freedom from differentiation. But even these wires, when tested\r\nby a certain condition of the first order of intensified molecular\r\nvibration for a transferring medium between centres of neutrality, I\r\nfind to be entirely inadequate for the transfer of concordant unition,\r\nas between one and the other, on account of nodal interferences. We\r\ncan appreciate the difficulty of converting such a medium to a uniform\r\nmolecular link, by knowing that it can be accomplished only after\r\nremoving all nodal interference, by inducing between the nodal waves\r\na condition in which they become subservient to the inter-sympathetic\r\nvibratory molecular link of such structure or wire.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to submit the wire to a system of\r\ngraduation in order to find what the combined chords of these nodal\r\ninterferences represent when focalized to one general centre. Then the\r\ndifferentiation between these nodal waves and the inter-molecular link\r\nmust be equated, by what I call a process of vibratory induction, so\r\nas to induce pure concordance between one and the other. To elaborate\r\non this system of graduation, for effecting conditions necessary to\r\nensure perfect and unadulterated transmission, would make up a book\r\nthat would take days to read and months to study.\r\n\r\nThe graduating of a perfectly constructed instrument, to a condition\r\nto transmit sympathetically, is no standard whatever for any other\r\none that may be built, nor ever will be, because no concordant\r\nconditions of compound molecular aggregation can ever exist in visible\r\ngroupings. If it were even possible to make their parts perfectly\r\naccurate one to the other, in regard to atmospheric displacement\r\nand weight, their resonating qualities would still have a high rate\r\nof sympathetic variation in their molecular groupings alone. If one\r\nthousand million of coins, each one representing a certain standard\r\nvalue, and all struck from the same die, were sympathetically graduated\r\nunder a vibratory subdivision of 150,000, the most amazing variation\r\nwould present itself, as between each individual coin throughout the\r\nnumber, in regard to their molecular grouping and resonance....\r\n\r\nIt will be realized in the future what immense difficulties have been\r\nencountered by Mr. Keely in perfecting his system of graduation, and in\r\nconstructing devices for the guidance of artificers and mechanicians,\r\nwhereby those who are not as abnormally endowed as he is for his work,\r\ncan bring a proper vibratory action into play to induce positive\r\nsympathetic transmission; as will also be realized the stupidity of\r\nthe men who still seek to confine his researches to perfecting the\r\nso-called Keely motor, before his system is sufficiently developed\r\nto enable others to follow it up, should his physical strength give\r\nout. His system of graduating research, when completed, will enable\r\nmen to take up the work, not from the standard of an already completed\r\nstructure that is true in its operation, though a perfect duplicate\r\nas to size and gravity be made, for each successively constructed\r\nmachine requires a knowledge of its own conditions of sensitivity,\r\nas regards its mass chords. Keely writes:--\r\n\r\n\"That tuning forks can be so constructed as to show coincident\r\nor concordant association with each other, is but a very weak\r\nillustration of the fact which governs pure acoustic assimilation. The\r\nbest only approach a condition of about a fortieth, as regards pure\r\nattractive and propulsive receptiveness. By differentiating them to\r\nconcordant thirds, they induce a condition of molecular bombardment\r\nbetween themselves, by alternate changes of long and short waves of\r\nsympathy. Bells rung in vacuo liberate the same number of corpuscules,\r\nat the same velocity as those surrounded by a normal atmosphere; and\r\nhence the same acoustic force attending them, but they are inaudible\r\nfrom the fact that, in vacuo, the molecular volume is reduced. Every\r\ngaseous molecule is a resonator of itself, and is sensitive to any\r\nand all sounds induced, whether accordant or discordant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswers to Questions.\r\n\r\nThe positive vibrations are the radiating or propulsive; the negative\r\nvibrations are the ones that are attracted towards the neutral\r\ncentre. The action of the magnetic flow is dual in its evolutions,\r\nboth attractive and propulsive. The sound vibrations of themselves\r\nhave no power whatever to induce dissociation, even in its lowest\r\nform. Certain differential, dual, triple and quadruple, chords give\r\nintroductory impulses which excite an action on molecular masses,\r\nliquid and gaseous, that increase their range of molecular motion and\r\nput them in that receptive state for sympathetic vibratory interchange\r\nwhich favours molecular disintegration; then, as I have shown, the\r\ndiatonic enharmonic is brought into play, which further increases the\r\nmolecular range of motion beyond fifty per cent. of their diameters,\r\nwhen molecular separation takes place, giving the tenuous substance\r\nthat is necessary to induce progressive subdivision. This molecular\r\ngaseous substance, during its evolution, assumes a condition of\r\nhigh rotation in the sphere or tube in which it has been generated,\r\nand becomes itself the medium, with the proper exciters, for further\r\nprogressive dissociation. The exciters include an illuminated revolving\r\nprism, condenser, and coloured lenses, with a capped glass tube strong\r\nenough to carry a pressure of at least one thousand pounds per square\r\ninch. To one of these caps a sectional wire of platinum and silver\r\nis attached; the other cap is attached to the tube, so screwed to the\r\nchamber as to allow it to lead to the neutral centre of said chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMineral Disintegration.\r\n\r\nI have been repeatedly urged to repeat my disintegrations of quartz\r\nrock; but it has been utterly out of my power to do so. The mechanical\r\ndevice with which I conducted those experiments was destroyed at the\r\ntime of the proceedings against me. Its graduation occupied over four\r\nyears, after which it was operated successfully. It had been originally\r\nconstructed as an instrument for overcoming gravity; a perfect,\r\ngraduated scale of that device was accurately registered, a copy of\r\nwhich I kept; I have since built three successive disintegrators\r\nset up from that scale, but they did not operate. This peculiar\r\nfeature remained a paradox to me until I had solved the conditions\r\ngoverning the chords of multiple masses; when this problem ceased\r\nto be paradoxical in its character. As I have said, there are no\r\ntwo compound aggregated forms of visible matter that are, or ever\r\ncan be, so duplicated as to show pure sympathetic concordance one to\r\nthe other. Hence the necessity of my system of graduation, and of a\r\ncompound device that will enable anyone to correct the variations\r\nthat exist in compound molecular structures; or in other words to\r\ngraduate such, so as to bring them to a successful operation....\r\n\r\n\r\nKeely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisturbance of Magnetic Needle.\r\n\r\nIf Keely's theories are correct, science will in time classify all\r\nthe important modifications of the one force in nature as sympathetic\r\nstreams, each stream composed of triple flows. Mr. Keely maintains\r\nthat the static condition which the magnetic needle assumes, when\r\nundisturbed by any extraneous force outside of its own sympathetic\r\none, proves conclusively that the power of the dominant third, of\r\nthe triple combination of the magnetic terrestrial envelope, is the\r\ncontrolling one of this sympathetic triplet, and the one towards\r\nwhich all the others co-ordinate. All the dominant conditions of\r\nnature represent the focal centres towards which like surrounding\r\nones become sympathetically subservient. The rapid rotation of the\r\nmagnetic needle of a compass which Mr. Keely shows in his experiments,\r\nrests entirely on the alternating of the dominant alone, which is\r\neffected by a triple condition of vibration that is antagonistic to\r\nits harmonious flow as associated with its other attendants. A rapid\r\nchange of polarity is induced, and rapid rotation necessarily follows.\r\n\r\nQuoting from Keely's writings,--\"The human ear cannot detect the\r\ntriple chord of any vibration, or sounding note, but every sound that\r\nis induced of any range, high or low, is governed by the same laws,\r\nas regards triple action of such, that govern every sympathetic flow\r\nin Nature. Were it not for these triple vibratory conditions, change\r\nof polarity could never be effected, and consequently there could be\r\nno rotation. Thus the compounding of the triple triple, to produce the\r\neffect, would give a vibration in multiplication reaching the ninth,\r\nin order to induce subservience, the enumeration of which it would\r\nbe folly to undertake, as the result would be a string of figures\r\nnearly a mile in length to denote it.\r\n\r\nWhen the proper impulse is given to induce the rotation with pure\r\nalternating corpuscular action, the conditions of action become\r\nperpetual in their character, lasting long enough from that one impulse\r\nto wear out any machine denoting such action, and on the sympathetic\r\nstream eternally perpetual. The action of the neutral or focalizing\r\ncentres represents molecular focalization and redistribution, not\r\nhaving any magnetism associated with them; but when the radiating arms\r\nof their centres are submitted to the triple compound vibratory force,\r\nrepresenting their mass thirds, they become magnetic and consequently\r\ncease their rotation. Their rotation is induced by submitting them\r\nto three different orders of vibration, simultaneously giving the\r\nmajority to the harmonic third.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory of the Induction of Sympathetic Chords to excite rotation,\r\nby vibrophonic trajection to and from centres of neutrality, as\r\ninduced and shown to Professor Leidy, Dr. Willcox, and others, on\r\nrevolving globe.\r\n\r\nAll hollow spheres, of certain diameters, represent, as per diameters\r\nand their volume of molecular mass, pure, unadulterated, sympathetic\r\nresonation towards the enharmonic and diatonic thirds of any, and\r\nin fact all, concordant sounds. In tubes it is adversely different,\r\nrequiring a definite number of them so graduated as to represent a\r\nconfliction by thirds, sixths, and ninths, as towards the harmonic\r\nscale. When the conditions are established, the acoustic result of\r\nthis combination, when focalized, represents concordant harmony,\r\nas between the chord mass of the instrument to be operated and\r\nchord mass of the tubes of resonation. Therefore the shortest\r\nway towards establishing pure concordance, between any number of\r\nresonating mediums, is by the position that Nature herself assumes\r\nin her multitudinous arrangements of the varied forms and volumes of\r\nmatter--the spherical. The great difficulty to overcome, in order to\r\nget a revolution of the said sphere, exists in equating the interior\r\nadjuncts of same. In other words, the differentiation induced must be\r\nso equated as to harmonize and make their conditions purely concordant\r\nto the molecular mass of the sphere. Example: Suppose the chord of the\r\nsphere mass represents B flat, or any other chord, and the internal\r\nadjuncts by displacement of atmospheric volume differentiates the\r\nvolume one-twentieth; this displacement in the shell's atmospheric\r\nvolume would represent an antagonistic twentieth against the shell's\r\nmass concordance, to equate which it would be necessary to so graduate\r\nthe shell's internal adjuncts as to get at the same chord;--an octave\r\nor any number of octaves that comes nearest to the concordance of\r\nthe shell's atmospheric volume. No intermediates between the octaves\r\nwould ever reach sympathetic union.\r\n\r\nWe will now take up the mechanical routine as associated with adjuncts\r\nof interference, and follow the system for chording the mechanical\r\naggregation in its different parts, in order to induce the transmissive\r\nsympathy necessary to perfect evolution, and to produce revolution\r\nof the sphere or shell.\r\n\r\nExample.--Suppose that we had just received from the machine shop a\r\nspun shell of twelve inches internal diameter, 1·32 of an inch thick,\r\nwhich represents an atmospheric volume of 904·77 cubic inches. On\r\ndetermination by research we find the shell to be on its resonating\r\nvolume B flat, and the molecular volume of the metal that the sphere\r\nis composed of, B natural. This or any other antagonistic chord, as\r\nbetween the chord mass of the shell and its atmospheric volume, would\r\nnot interfere but would come under subservience. We now pass a steel\r\nshaft through its centre, 1/2 inch in diameter, which represents its\r\naxial rest. This shaft subjects the atmospheric volume of the shell to\r\na certain displacement or reduction, to correct which we first register\r\nthe chord note of its mass, and find it to be antagonistic to the\r\nchord mass of the shell, a certain portion of an octave. This must be\r\ncorrected. The molecular volume of the shaft must be reduced in volume,\r\neither by filing or turning, so as to represent the first B flat chord\r\nthat is reached by such reduction. When this is done the first line of\r\ninterference is neutralized, and the condition of sympathy is as pure\r\nbetween the parts as it was when the globe was minus its axis. There is\r\nnow introduced on its axis a ring which has seven tubes or graduating\r\nresonators, the ring being two-thirds the diameter of the globe,\r\nthe resonators three inches long and 3/4 inch diameter, each one to\r\nbe set on the chord of B flat, which is done by sliding the small\r\ndiaphragm in the tube to a point that will indicate B flat. This\r\nsetting then controls the metallic displacement of the metallic\r\ncombination, as also of the arms necessary to hold the ring and\r\nresonators on shaft or axis. Thus the second equation is established,\r\nboth on resonation and displacement. We are now ready to introduce\r\nthe diatonic scale ring of three octaves which is set at two-thirds\r\nof the scale antagonistic to the chord mass of the globe itself. This\r\nis done by graduating every third pin of its scale to B flat, thirds,\r\nwhich represent antagonistic thirds to the shell's molecular mass. This\r\nantagonism must be thoroughly sensitive to the chord mass of one of\r\nthe hemispheres of which the globe is composed. The axis of the scale\r\nring must rotate loosely on the globe's shaft without revolving with\r\nthe globe itself; which it is prevented from doing by being weighted\r\non one side of the ring by a small hollow brass ball, holding about\r\ntwo ounces of lead. The remaining work on the device is finished by\r\npainting the interior of the globe, one hemisphere black and one white,\r\nand attaching a rubber bulb such as is used to spray perfume, to the\r\nhollow end of the shaft. This bulb equates vibratory undulations,\r\nthus preventing an equation of molecular bombardment on its dark side\r\nwhen sympathetically influenced. It is now in condition to denote\r\nthe sympathetic concordance between living physical organisms, or\r\nthe receptive transmittive concordance necessary to induce rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophy of Transmission and Rotation of Musical Sphere.\r\n\r\nThe only two vibratory conditions that can be so associated as to\r\nexcite high sympathetic affinity, as between two physical organisms,\r\nare:--Etheric chord of B flat, 3rd octave, and on etheric sympathetic\r\nchords transmission E flat on the scale 3rd, 6ths, and 9ths; octaves\r\nharmonic; having the 3rd dominant, the 6th enharmonic, and the 9th\r\ndiatonic.\r\n\r\nThe chord mass representing the musical sphere, being the sympathetic\r\netheric chord of B flat third octave, indicated by the focalization of\r\nits interior mechanical combination, as against the neutral sevenths\r\nof its atmospheric volume, makes the shell highly sensitive to the\r\nreception of pure sympathetic concordance, whether it be physical,\r\nmechanical, or a combination of both. Taking the chord mass of\r\nthe different mechanical parts of the sphere and its adjuncts, as\r\npreviously explained, when associated and focalized to represent\r\npure concordance, as between its atmospheric volume and sphere mass,\r\nwhich means the pure unit of concordance, we have the highest position\r\nthat can be established in relation to its sympathetic susceptiveness\r\nto negative antagonism. The beauty of the perfection of the laws that\r\ngovern the action of Nature's sympathetic flows is here demonstrated in\r\nall the purity of its workings, actually requiring antagonistic chords\r\nto move and accelerate. The dark side of the shell, which represents\r\nfifty per cent. of its full area of pure concordant harmony, is the\r\nreceptive area for the influence of the negative transmissive chords\r\nof the thirds, sixths and ninths to bombard upon; which bombardment\r\ndisturbs the equilibrium of said sphere, and induces rotation. The\r\nrotation can be accelerated or retarded, according as the antagonistic\r\nchords of the acoustic forces are transmitted in greater or lesser\r\nvolume. The action induced by the mouth organ, transmitted at a\r\ndistance from the sphere without any connection of wire, demonstrates\r\nthe purity of the principle of sympathetic transmission, as negatized\r\nor disturbed by discordants; which, focalizing on the resonating\r\nsevenths of resonators, or tubes attached to ring, the sympathetic\r\nflow is by this means transmitted to the focalizing centre, or centre\r\nof neutrality, to be re-distributed at each revolution of sphere,\r\nkeeping intact the sympathetic volume during sensitization, thus\r\npreventing the equation or stoppage of its rotation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the sphere resting on its journals in the ring, as graduated\r\nto the condition of its interior combinations, represents a pure\r\nsympathetic concordant under perfect equation ready to receive the\r\nsympathetic, or to reject the non-sympathetic. If a pure sympathetic\r\nchord is transmitted coincident to its full combination, the sphere\r\nwill remain quiescent; but if a transmission of discordance is brought\r\nto bear upon it, its sympathetic conditions become repellent to this\r\ndiscordance....\r\n\r\nKeely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHertz in his conjectures that a knowledge of the structure of ether\r\nshould unveil the essence of matter itself, and of its inherent\r\nproperties, weight and inertia, is treading the path that leads to this\r\nknowledge. Professor Fitzgerald says:--\"Ether must be the means by\r\nwhich electric and magnetic forces exist, it should explain chemical\r\nactions, and if possible gravity.\" The law of sympathetic vibration\r\nexplains chemical affinities as a sympathetic attractive, but inherent,\r\nforce; in short, as gravity. This opens up too wide a territory even\r\nbut to peer into in the dawning light of Keely's system of vibratory\r\nphysics. The boundary line is crossed, and the crowds of researchers\r\nin electro-magnetism are full of ardour. Hertz constructed a circuit,\r\nwhose period of vibration for electric currents was such that he was\r\nable to see sparks, due to the increased vibration, leaping across a\r\nsmall air-space in this resonant circuit; his experiments have proved\r\nand demonstrated the ethereal theory of electro-magnetism:--that\r\nelectro-magnetic actions are due to a medium pervading all known\r\nspace; while Keely's experiments have proved that all things are due\r\nto conditions of ether.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fitzgerald closes one of his lectures on ether in these\r\nwords:--\"There are metaphysical grounds for reducing matter to motion,\r\nand potential to kinetic energy. Let us for a moment contemplate what\r\nis betokened by this theory that in electro-magnetic engines we are\r\nusing as our mechanism the ether, the medium that fills all known\r\nspace. It was a great step in human progress when man learnt to make\r\nmaterial machines, when he used the elasticity of his bow, and the\r\nrigidity of his arrow to provide food and defeat his enemies. It was a\r\ngreat advance when he learnt to use the chemical action of fire; when\r\nhe learnt to use water to float his boats, and air to drive them; when,\r\nby artificial selection, he provided himself with food and domestic\r\nanimals. For two hundred years he has made heat his slave to drive\r\nhis machinery. Fire, water, earth, and air have long been his slaves,\r\nbut it is only within the last few years that man has won the battle\r\nlost by the giants of old, has snatched the thunderbolt from Jove\r\nhimself, and enslaved the all-pervading ether.\"\r\n\r\nOf the experiments of Hertz, in inducing vibrations \"in ether waves,\"\r\nProfessor Fitzgerald says: \"If we consider the possible radiating\r\npower of an atom, we find that it may be millions of millions of\r\ntimes as great as Professor Wiedermann has found to be the radiating\r\npower of a sodium atom in a Bunsen burner; so if there is reason\r\nto think that any greater oscillation might disintegrate the atom,\r\nwe are still a long way from it.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have an admission that the atom may be divisible; but the\r\nprofessor's conjecture is made upon an incorrect hypothesis. The\r\n\"possible theory of ether and matter\" which Professor Fitzgerald puts\r\nforward, in his lecture on Electro-Magnetic Radiation, is in harmony\r\nwith Keely's theories. This hypothesis explains the differences\r\nin nature as differences in motion, ending: \"Can we resist the\r\nconclusion that all motion is thought? Not that contradiction in terms,\r\n'unconscious thought,' but living thought; that all nature is the\r\nlanguage of One in whom we live, and move, and have our being?\" This\r\ngreat truth the Buddhists have taught for ages. There is no such thing\r\nas blind or dead matter, as there is no blind nor unconscious thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1891.\r\n\r\n\"MORE SCIENCE.\"\r\n\r\n        The only hope for science is more science.--Drummond.\r\n\r\n        \"Philosophy must finally endeavour to be itself\r\n        constructive.\" Here Professor Seth laid stress on the necessity\r\n        of a teleological view of the universe, not in the paltry,\r\n        mechanical sense sometimes associated with the word teleology,\r\n        but as vindicating the existence of an end or organic unity\r\n        in the process of the world, constituting it an evolution\r\n        and not a series of aimless changes.... As Goethe taught,\r\n        in one of his finest poems, we do well to recognize in the\r\n        highest attributes of human-kind our nearest glimpse into\r\n        the nature of the divine. The part was not greater than the\r\n        whole, and we might rest assured that whatever of wisdom and\r\n        goodness there was in us had not been born out of nothing,\r\n        but had its fount, somewhere and somehow, in a more perfect\r\n        Goodness and Truth.--Review of Professor Seth's address.\r\n\r\n        Believe nothing which is unreasonable, and reject nothing as\r\n        unreasonable without proper examination.--Gautama Buddha.\r\n\r\n        I do not believe that matter is inert, acted upon by an\r\n        outside force. To me it seems that every atom is possessed\r\n        by a certain amount of primitive intelligence.--Edison.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory tells us that Pythagoras would not allow himself to be called a\r\nsage, as his predecessors had done, but designated himself as a lover\r\nof wisdom; ardent in the pursuit of wisdom, he could not arrogate\r\nto himself the possession of wisdom. Yet, in our time, so unwilling\r\nare the searchers after wisdom to admit that there can be anything\r\n\"new under the sun,\" anything that they do not already know, that we\r\nfind the number of men of science to be marvellously small who possess\r\nthe first condition of success in scientific research, as set down by\r\nHerbert Spencer, very few who do not arrogate to themselves too much\r\nlearning to permit them to admit the possibility of any new revelation\r\nof truth. In every age of our world, to meet the requirements of the\r\nage, in its step-by-step progress from barbarism to civilization and\r\nenlightenment, there have appeared extraordinary men, having knowledge\r\nfar in advance of the era in which they lived. Of such, among many,\r\nwere Moses, Zoroaster, Confucius, Plato, and above these, Gautama the\r\nBuddha. But Moses, with all his knowledge of bacilli and bacteria,\r\ncould not have met the requirements of any later age. The \"eye for an\r\neye\" and \"tooth for a tooth\" period passed, and King David, who was\r\nso superior to other Kings of marauding tribes, that he was called \"a\r\nman after God's own heart,\" satisfied his desire for punishment, to be\r\nmeted out to his personal enemies, by prayer to God to \"put out their\r\neyes,\" and to \"let them fall from one wickedness to another.\" This was\r\na step in advance, for it gave those who had offended him a chance to\r\nescape all such summary proceedings as Moses had authorized. Still,\r\nthe time was a long way off before a greater than Moses appeared to\r\nteach the world that such prayers are unavailing, that we can hate sin\r\nwithout hating the sinner, and that the Alpha and Omega of religion is\r\nto live in love and in the performance of duty. The Jewish prophets\r\nforetold the coming of Jesus of Nazareth; and the interpreters of\r\nScripture are not alone now in having predicted that we are approaching\r\na new dispensation, an age of harmony, which the twentieth century\r\nis to usher in, according to Biblical prophets. Renan has said that\r\nhe envies those who shall live to see the wonders which the light of\r\nthe new dawn that is breaking upon the world of science will unfold;\r\nthat those who live in this coming age will know things of which we\r\nhave no conception. Morley, in the spirit of prophecy, has said that\r\nin the near future a great intellectual giant will arise to bless\r\nour globe, who will surpass all other men of genius, reasoning that\r\nthe representative of a larger age must be greater in genius than any\r\npredecessor. When the system is made known by which Keely dissociates\r\nthe molecule and atoms by successive orders of vibration, proving\r\ntwo laws in physics as fallacious, we shall not hesitate to say that\r\n\"the light of the new dawn\" has now broken upon the world of science,\r\nand that the discoverer of the divisibility of the atom and of the\r\nabsorption of energy in all molecular aggregation is the genius\r\nforetold by Morley. One quality of true genius is humility. \"What\r\na brain you must have!\" said a man of science to Keely, not long\r\nsince, \"to have thought this all out.\" This man of genius replied,\r\n\"I was but the instrument of a Higher Power.\" We are all instruments\r\nof a Higher Power, but the instruments chosen and set apart for any\r\nspecial work are always choice instruments which have been fitted or\r\nadapted to that work--the furnace perhaps seven times heated before\r\nthe annealing was perfected.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that man enters upon life as a born idiot; and there\r\nare many who think that, in comparison with the possibilities which the\r\nfuture promises in the way of the physical evolution of the race, we\r\nare but as idiots still. Having reached our present stage of physical\r\nand mental development, the history of the civilization of our race\r\ncannot but lead reflecting men and women into the opinion that the work\r\nof evolution will become more purely psychical in future. After which,\r\nas a consequence, there can be no doubt that physical development\r\nwill again take its turn; for, as Tennyson has said,--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"When reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm,\r\n        Then springs the coming race that rules mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNot the least among the many applications of Keely's discoveries will\r\nbe that which will prove, by demonstration, whether the chord of mass\r\nin a man and woman is near enough in the octaves to be beneficial,\r\nor so far apart as to be deteriorating.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"There is no truer truth obtainable\r\n        By man than comes of music.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earlier processes of civilization belonged to an age of\r\nspontaneity, of unreflective productivity; an age that expressed\r\nitself in myths, created religious and organized social forms and\r\nhabits of life in harmony with these spontaneous creations.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"O, ye delicious fables! where the wave\r\n          And woods were peopled and the air with things\r\n        So lovely! Why, ah why, has Science grave\r\n          Scattered afar your sweet imaginings?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nasks Barry Cornwall. But now that we have entered upon a more advanced\r\nage in thought, as in all things pertaining to discovery and practical\r\napplication, or invention, a critical defining intellectual age,\r\nwe must henceforth depend upon true science for our progress toward\r\na higher enlightenment. Science, as will be seen, embraces religion,\r\nand must become, as Keely asserts, the religion of the world, when\r\nit is made known in all its glory and grandeur, sweeping away all\r\nfoot-holds for scepticism, and spreading the knowledge of God, as a God\r\nof love, until this knowledge covers the earth as the waters cover the\r\nsea. As has been said, the word science, in its largest signification,\r\nincludes intellectual achievement in every direction open to the mind,\r\nand the co-ordination of the results in a progressive philosophy\r\nof life. Philosophy has been defined as the science of causes or\r\nof first principles, and should be limited, almost exclusively, to\r\nthe mental sciences. This is the field which Keely is exploring; the\r\nknowledge of the \"hidden things\" which he is bringing to the light is\r\npure philosophical knowledge, in the widest acceptation of the term:\r\nthe knowledge of effects as dependent on their causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Behold an infinite of floating worlds\r\n        Dividing crystal waves of ether pure\r\n        In endless voyage without port.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it not a marvel of inspiration to have been able to cast line\r\nand plummet in such a sea of knowledge, to be able to demonstrate\r\nthe power of that \"sympathetic outreach\" which, acting from our\r\nsatellite upon the waters of our oceans and seas, through the vast\r\nspace that separates it from our earth, lifts these waters, once in\r\nevery twenty-four hours, from their beds; and, as gently as a mother\r\nwould lay her infant on its couch, places them again where they rest?\r\n\r\nGod hath chosen, as Paul said, the foolish things of the world to\r\nconfound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world\r\nto confound the things which are mighty, and base things of the world\r\nand things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which\r\nare not to bring to naught things which are; that no flesh should\r\nglory in His presence. Christ said, \"I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of\r\nheaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise\r\nand prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\"\r\n\r\nTruth never changes; but as new truths are revealed to us, to meet\r\nthe necessities of progress (in our development from ignorance\r\ninto the wisdom of angels), our point of view is ever changing,\r\nlike the landscape which we look out upon from the swiftly gliding\r\nrailway-carriage that bears us to our destination. As yet, \"Earth\r\nhas shown us only the title-page of a book\" that we may, if we will,\r\nread its first pages here, and continue reading throughout eternity.\r\n\r\nWhen Bulwer wrote of \"a power that can replenish or invigorate life,\r\nheal and preserve, cure disease: enabling the physical organism to\r\nre-establish the due equilibrium of its natural powers, thereby curing\r\nitself,\" he foreshadowed one of Keely's discoveries. \"Once admit the\r\npossibility that the secrets of nature conceal forces yet undeveloped,\"\r\nsays the author of \"Masollam,\" \"which may contain a cure for the evils\r\nby which it is now afflicted, and it is culpable timidity to shrink\r\nfrom risking all to discover that cure.\" This author teaches that\r\nhumanity at large has a claim higher than the claims of the blood-tie;\r\nthat a love based upon no higher sentiment, makes us blind to the\r\nclaims of duty; and this is why, when men or women are chosen to do\r\na great work, for the human family, the ligaments which have bound\r\nthem too exclusively to their own families, are cut and torn apart.\r\n\r\nNo greater work has ever been committed to a man to do than that which\r\nKeely's discoveries are preparing the way for. Science was rocking the\r\nworld into the sleep of death--for materialism is death--its votaries\r\ndeclaring atoms to be eternally active, and the intellect which had\r\ndiscovered the existence of these atoms to end with the life of the\r\nmolecular body. On this subject Simmons has written:--\r\n\r\n\"Shall impalpable light speed so swiftly and safely through infinite\r\nspace--and the mind that measures its speed, and makes it tell its\r\nsecrets in the spectroscope, be buried with the body? Shall mere breath\r\nsend its pulsations through the wire and, after fifty miles of silence,\r\nsound again in speech or music in a far-off city, or stamp itself in\r\nthe phonograph to sound again in far-off centuries--and the soul that\r\nhas wrought these wonders pass to eternal silence? Shall physical\r\nforce persist for ever--and this love, which is the strongest force\r\nin nature, perish? It would seem wiser to trust that the infinite\r\nlaw, which is everywhere else so true, will take care of this human\r\nlonging which it has made, and fulfil it in eternal safety. We\r\nmake no argument, but we cannot ignore all the intimations of\r\nimmortality. Cyrus Field tells us of the night when, after his\r\nweary search for that long-lost cable two miles deep in mid-ocean,\r\nthe grapnel caught it and, trembling with suspense, they drew it to\r\nthe deck, hardly trusting their eyes, but creeping to feel it and make\r\nsure it was there. And when, as they watched, a spark soon came from a\r\nfinger in England, showing that the line was sound, strong men wept and\r\nrockets rent the midnight darkness. We and our world float like a ship\r\non the mysterious sea of being, in whose abysses the grapnel of science\r\ntouches no solid line of logic connecting us to another land. But now\r\nand then there come from convictions, stronger than cables, flashes\r\nof light bidding us trust that our dead share in divine immortality,\r\nand are safe in the arms of Infinite Law and Eternal Love.\"\r\n\r\nKeely's demonstrations suggest \"the missing link\" between matter and\r\nmind, the solid line of logic which may yet be laid in \"the widening\r\ndominion of the human mind over the forces of nature.\" In \"Keely's\r\nSecrets,\" No. 9, Vol. I. of the T.P.S., some of the elements of the\r\npossibilities resulting to the world from Keely's discoveries were\r\nset down. War will become an impossibility; and, as Browning's poem of\r\n\"Childe Roland\" forecasts, \"The Dark Tower\" of unbelief will crumble at\r\nthe bugle-blast which levels its walls to their foundation, revealing\r\nsuch a boundless region of research as the mind of man could never\r\nconceive were he not the offspring of the Creator. Not long since,\r\nMr. Keely was congratulated upon having secured the attention of men of\r\nscience, connected with the University of Pennsylvania, to his work of\r\nresearch. \"Now, you will be known as a great discoverer, not as Keely\r\nthe motor-man,\" said one of them present; whom he answered, \"I have\r\ndiscovered so little, in comparison with what remains to be discovered,\r\nthat I cannot call myself a discoverer.\" One of the professors present\r\ntook Keely by the hand and said, \"You are a great discoverer.\"\r\n\r\nAll thoughtful men who have witnessed the latest developments of the\r\nforce displayed by Keely, in his researching experiments for aerial\r\nnavigation, are made to realize that more through his discoveries,\r\nthan by the progressive development of the altruistic element in\r\nhumanity (dreamed of by speculative optimists), our race will be\r\nbrought into that dispensation of peace and harmony, anticipated by\r\n\"seers\" and foretold by prophets as the millennial age. It requires\r\nno great measure of foresight to discern, as a natural consequence of\r\nthe control and application of this force in art and commerce, that\r\nameliorated condition of the masses which will end the mighty conflict\r\nnow so blindly being waged between capital and labour. [11] And to\r\nthe eye of faith, it is not difficult to look beyond the intervening\r\næons of centuries, to the literal fulfilment of the promise of that\r\nmillennial period when men shall live in brotherly love together;\r\nmaking heaven of earth as even now it is in our power to do if we\r\nlive up to Christ's command: \"Whatsoever ye would that others should\r\ndo unto you, that do ye also unto them.\" Had some of the dogmatic\r\nscientists of this age followed this command, Keely's discovery\r\nmight have been sooner known in all its importance, protecting him,\r\nas their acknowledgment would have done, from the persecutions that\r\nhave operated so detrimentally against the completion of researches\r\nwhich should have been finished before any attempt was made to apply\r\nthe discovery to commercial ends. No scientist who witnessed the\r\nproduction of the force, displayed by Keely, in a proper spirit,\r\nbut would have been welcomed by him to further experiments in its\r\noperations, as were Professor Leidy and Dr. Wilcox in 1889. So, in\r\ntruth, those who printed their edicts against Keely about ten years\r\nsince are, in part, responsible for the loss to the world which\r\nthis long delay has occasioned. Still, in view of the acknowledged\r\nfact that not one of the great laws which science now accepts as\r\nincontrovertible truths, but was vehemently denied by the scientists\r\nof its time, declared to be a priori impossible; its discoverers and\r\nsupporters denounced as fools or charlatans, and even investigation\r\nrefused as being a waste of time and thought; it would be too much to\r\nexpect from the thinkers of this age any greater degree of readiness\r\nto investigate claims, that threatened to demolish their cherished\r\nnotions, than characterized their predecessors.\r\n\r\nBut the time was not ripe for the disclosure: \"God never hurries.\" He\r\ncounts the centuries as we count the seconds, and the nearer that\r\nwe approach to the least comprehension of His \"underlying purpose,\"\r\nthe better fitted are we to do the work He assigns us, while waiting\r\npatiently for our path of duty to be made clear to us; like the\r\nlabourer, in Tolstoi's Confession, who completed the work that had\r\nbeen laid out for him, without understanding what the result would\r\nbe, and unable to judge whether his master had planned well. If the\r\nprophecies of Scripture are fulfilled, the twentieth century will\r\nusher in the commencement of that age in which men and women will\r\nbecome aware of the great powers which they inherit, and of which\r\nOliphant has said that we are so ignorant that we wholly fail to see\r\nthem, though they sweep like mighty seas throughout all human nature.\r\n\r\nWhat is the character of these powers which Oliphant has written so\r\neloquently concerning? Can we not form an inference from St. Paul's\r\nmost precious and deeply scientific context, in which he introduced\r\nthe quotation from the Greek poet Aratus, who was well known in Athens,\r\nhaving studied there?\r\n\r\nIf we are the offspring of God, how rich must be our inheritance! If\r\nwe are the children of God, why do we not trust our Father? But this\r\nis not science! A philosopher has said that if ever a human being\r\nneeded divine pity, it is the man of science who believes in nothing\r\nbut what he can prove by scientific methods. Scientists will have to\r\nadmit, in the light of Keely's discoveries, that the sensibility and\r\nintelligence, which confer upon us our self-directive power, do not\r\nhave their origin in our molecular structures. That they take their\r\nfirst beginning in matter is one of the most inadequate conceptions\r\nthat was ever proposed for scientific belief. If it were so, we\r\ncould not claim to be the offspring of God, who is the Fountain of\r\nall life, the ever living, from whom, as \"His very kind,\" we inherit\r\nthis self-directive power; not the molecular bodies which are our\r\nclothing. God is our Father. The material structure is the mother\r\nand nurse. The hypothesis that there are no beings in the universe\r\nbut those which possess molecular bodies, is the conjecture of a mind\r\nthat has no conception of the illimitable power of the Almighty. The\r\nlink, which connects mind with matter, gives us a higher conception\r\nof the Deity. Keely places it in the mind flow, the result of the\r\nsixth subdivision. When we are done with \"the things of Time,\" and\r\nnot before, we are ready to rise out of our molecular bondage into\r\nthe freedom we inherit as heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ of\r\nsonship with the Father.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the origin of life would become a matter of\r\neasy analysis, writes Keely, if the properties governing the\r\ndifferent orders of matter could be understood in their different\r\nevolutions. Disturbance of equilibrium is the prime mover, aggregator\r\nand disperser of all forces that exist in nature. The force of the\r\nmind on matter is a grand illustration of the power of the finer over\r\nthe crude, of the etheric over the molecular. If the differential\r\nforces of the brain could become equated, eternal perpetuity would be\r\nthe result. Under such a condition the physical would remain free of\r\ndisintegration or decomposition. But the law, laid out by the Great\r\nMaster, which governs the disturbance of equilibrium, making the crude\r\nforms of matter subservient to the finer or higher forms, forbidding\r\nanything molecular or terrestrial to assimilate with the high etheric,\r\nthe law that has fixed the planets in their places, is an unknown\r\nlaw to the finite mind, comprehended only by the Infinite One....\r\n\r\nSome of our men of science once settled the problem of the origin of\r\nlife to their own satisfaction, only to learn that \"speculation is\r\nnot science;\" for a substance which, when dissolved, crystallizes as\r\ngypsum, cannot produce vital force; and it is like groping among the\r\nbones of a graveyard to look for spontaneous generation in a shining\r\nheap of jelly on the floor of the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen our learned men are forced to admit that \"all motion is thought,\"\r\nthat \"all nature is the language of One in whom we live, and are moved,\r\nand have our being,\" the attempts to evolve life out of chemical\r\nelements will cease; the Mosaic records will no longer be denied,\r\nwhich tell us that the Creator's law for living organisms is that\r\neach plant seeds, and each animal bears, after its kind; not that\r\neach seeds and bears after another kind. The doctrine of evolution,\r\nas made known to us in Geology, is a fundamental truth; proving that\r\n\"there has been a plan, glorious in its scheme, perfect in system,\r\nprogressing through unmeasured ages, and looking ever toward man and\r\na spiritual end.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Andrew, in his \"Thoughts on the Evolution Theory of\r\nCreation,\" mentions that Haeckel gives the pedigree of man from\r\nprimeval moneron in twenty-two stages. Stage twenty is the man-like\r\nape; stage twenty-one is the ape-like man; stage twenty-two is the man;\r\nbut he confesses that the twenty-first stage--the ape-like man--is\r\nentirely wanting in all the records.\r\n\r\nThere is no missing link in the evolution theory, as laid down in\r\nKeely's pure philosophy. Inasmuch as the Father of all is Himself\r\na Spiritual Being, cosmical law leads us to expect that the type of\r\ncreated being, His offspring, shall be spirit also. Nor can Being in\r\nany object be so attenuated, or so far removed from Him who filleth\r\nall in all, but it must surely retain an aura of His spiritual\r\nnature. The corner-stone of this philosophy is one power, one law;\r\norder and method reigning throughout creation; spirit controlling\r\nmatter, as the Divine order and law of creation that the spiritual\r\nshould govern the material--that the whole realm of matter should\r\nbe under the dominion of the world of spirit. Nor is this a new\r\ntruth. According to Diogenes Laërtius, Thales taught that souls are\r\nthe motive forces of the universe. Empedocles affirms that spiritual\r\nforces move the visible world. Virgil asserted that mind animates\r\nand moves the world; that the spiritual realm is the soul of the\r\nuniverse. The universe is not a mass of dead matter, says Gilbert (in\r\nhis work, \"De Magnate\"), but is pervaded with this soul, this living\r\nprinciple, this unseen cause of all visible phenomena, underlying\r\nall movements in the earth beneath and in the heavens above. Joseph\r\nCook affirms that as science progresses it draws nearer in all its\r\nforms to the proof of the spiritual origin of force--that is of the\r\nDivine immanence in natural law: and that God was not transiently\r\npresent in nature--that is in a mere creative moment; nor has He left\r\nthe world in a state of orphanage, bereft of a deific influence and\r\ncare, but He is immanent in nature, as the Apostle Paul and Aratus\r\nand Spinoza declared. As certainly as the unborn infant's life is\r\nthat of the mother, so is it divinely true that somehow God's life\r\nincludes ours; and we shall understand the nature of that relationship\r\nwhen, in due time, we have been \"born again\" into the life of the\r\nspirit. \"The economy of creation is not regarded in this philosophy\r\nas a theory of development all in one direction; but as a cycle in\r\nwhich, after development, and as its fruit, the last term gives again\r\nthe first. Herein is found the link by which the law of continuity\r\nis maintained throughout--the link which is missing in the popular\r\nscience of the day; with this very serious consequence that, to keep\r\nthe break out of sight, the entire doctrine of spirit and the spiritual\r\nworld is ignored or altogether denied.\" Science admits that nature\r\nworks with dual force, though at rest she is a unit. \"Nature is one\r\neternal circle.\" Keely's discoveries prove that the doctrine of the\r\nTrinity should be set down as an established canon of science--the\r\nTrinity of force. All nature's sympathetic streams--cerebellic,\r\ngravital, electric and magnetic--are made up of triple currents. The\r\nancients understood this dogma in a far deeper sense than modern\r\ntheology has construed it. The great and universal Trinity of cause,\r\nmotion and matter--or of will, thought and manifestation--was known\r\nto the Rosicrucians as prima materia. Paracelsus states that each\r\nof these three is also the other two; for, as nothing can possibly\r\nexist without cause, matter and energy--that is, spirit, matter and\r\nsoul (the ultimate cause of existence being that it exists), we may\r\ntherefore look upon all forms of activity as being the action of\r\nthe universal or Divine will operating upon and through the ether,\r\nas the skilled artificer uses his tools to accomplish his designs;\r\nmaking the comparison in all reverence.\r\n\r\n\"The existence of an intelligent Creator, a personal God, can to my\r\nmind, almost be proved from chemistry,\" writes Edison; and George\r\nParsons Lathrop, in commenting upon Edison's belief, says:--\"Surely\r\nit is a circumstance calculated to excite reflection, and to\r\ncause a good deal of satisfaction, that this keen and penetrating\r\nmind, so vigorously representing the practical side of American\r\nintelligence--the mind of a remarkable exponent of applied science, and\r\nof a brilliant and prolific inventor who has spent his life in dealing\r\nwith the material part of the world--should so confidently arrive\r\nat belief in God through a study of those media that often obscure\r\nthe perception of spiritual things.\" Edison, it seems, like Keely,\r\nhas never been discouraged by the obstacles which he meets with, in\r\nhis researches, nor even inclined to be hopeless of ultimate success.\r\n\r\nUnlike Keely, Edison through all his years of experimental research has\r\nnever once made a discovery. All the work of this great and successful\r\ninventor has been deductive, and the results achieved by him have been\r\nsimply those of pure invention. Like Keely he constructs a theory,\r\nand works on its lines until he finds it untenable; then, he at once\r\ndiscards it and forms another theory. In connection with the electric\r\nlight, he evolved or constructed three thousand successive theories;\r\neach one reasonable and apparently likely to be true; yet, only in\r\ntwo cases was he able to prove by experiment that his theories were\r\ncorrect. Of such a nature is the \"dead-work\" which all researchers\r\non scientific principles must toil through to attain success.\r\n\r\nThey must keep their minds open to every suggestion or idea, no matter\r\nhow fanciful it may seem to others, and they must never let go their\r\nhold of it until it has been tested in all its possibilities. The same\r\nwords which Lathrop uses, in describing Edison's characteristics, are\r\nequally applicable to Keely, who, in addition to his native endowment\r\nof a genius for science and mechanics, brings to bear vast patience\r\nin logical deduction, careful calculation, unlimited experiment, a\r\nceaseless industry, and a persistence which refuses to be discouraged.\r\n\r\nEdison has said that he does not philosophize. Like General Grant,\r\nhe is a man of action. When asked what theory he held upon a subject\r\nunder discussion, General Grant replied, \"I never theorize: when\r\nthere is anything to be done, I do it.\" [12] Edison is always doing\r\nsomething which the public can see and appreciate, but, unlike Keely,\r\nhe has no system to work out and transmute into the pure philosophy\r\nwhich is now revealing to the world \"the further link in the chain\r\nof causation,\" \"the cause of the cause,\" which hitherto has rather\r\nbeen assumed than demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"If we believe,\" says Professor Sir G. G. Stokes, \"that what are\r\ncalled the natural sciences spring from the same supreme source\r\nas those which are concerned with morals and Natural Theology in\r\ngeneral, we may expect to find broad lines of analogy between the\r\ntwo; and thus it may conceivably happen that the investigations,\r\nwhich belong to natural science, may here and there afford us hints\r\nwith respect even to the moral sciences, with which at first sight\r\nthey might appear to have no connection. And if such are to be found,\r\nperhaps they are more likely to be indicated by one whose studies\r\nhave lain mainly in the direction of those natural sciences than by\r\none whose primary attention has been devoted to moral subjects.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Keely's first discovery of an unknown force and the releasing\r\nof an unknown energy seemed to be by accident; and most certainly no\r\none could then have foreseen that his researches in physical science\r\nwould lead him on step by step, and very slow steps they have been,\r\nto such important findings. In the pursuit of physical science he\r\nencountered paradoxes and anomalies, the study of which led him on\r\nto fresh discoveries whereby he has been able to extend the boundary\r\nof ascertained truth and separate the wheat of science from the chaff.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Macvicar said when he considered how difficult he\r\nhad found it to believe that such insight into nature as his views\r\nimply is possible to be attained, he was not so unreasonable as to\r\nexpect that others would, in his time, regard them even as probable,\r\nmuch less as proved. He expressed himself as content with the private\r\nenjoyment which these views imparted to himself, \"especially as that\r\nenjoyment is not merely the gratification of a chemical curiosity,\r\nbut attaches to a much larger field of thought.\" One of the points\r\nto which he refers, as possessing great value to his own mind,\r\nis the place which his investigation assigns to material nature in\r\nthe universe of being. He says that it is much the fashion in the\r\npresent day to regard matter and force, more shortly matter, as all in\r\nall. But, according to the view of things which has presented itself\r\nto both of these men, \"matter comes out rather as a precipitate\r\nin the universal ether, determined by a mathematical necessity;\r\na grand and beautiful cloud-work in the realm of light, bounded on\r\nboth sides by a world of spirits; on the upper and anterior side,\r\nby the great Creator Himself, and the hierarchy of spirits to which\r\nHe awarded immediate existence; and on the lower and posterior side,\r\nby that world of spirits of which the material body is the mother\r\nand nurse.\" Macvicar says the hypothesis that there are no beings\r\nin the universe but those which possess a molecular structure, and\r\nthat sensibility and intelligence take their first beginnings in\r\nsuch structures, is one of the most inadequate conceptions that was\r\never proposed for scientific belief. Science is not only very blind,\r\nbut glories in her blindness. She gropes among the dead seeking\r\nthe origin of life, instead of going to the Fountain of all life,\r\nthe Ever Living, as Dr. Macvicar and Keely have done.\r\n\r\nIn theorizing on the philosophy of planetary suspension Mr. Keely\r\nwrites: \"As regards planetary volume, we would ask in a scientific\r\npoint of view--How can the immense difference of volume in the\r\nplanets exist without disorganizing the harmonious action that\r\nhas always characterized them? I can only answer this question\r\nproperly by entering into a progressive synthesis, starting on the\r\nrotating etheric centres that were fixed by the Creator with their\r\nattractive or accumulative power. If you ask what power it is that\r\ngives to each etheric atom its inconceivable velocity of rotation,\r\nor introductory impulse, I must answer that no finite mind will ever\r\nbe able to conceive what it is. The philosophy of accumulation,\"\r\nassimilation, Macvicar calls it, \"is the only proof that such a power\r\nhas been given. The area, if we can so speak of such an atom, presents\r\nto the attractive or magnetic, the elective or propulsive, all the\r\nreceptive force and all the antagonistic force that characterizes a\r\nplanet of the largest magnitude; consequently, as the accumulation\r\ngoes on, the perfect equation remains the same. When this minute\r\ncentre has once been fixed, the power to rend it from its position\r\nwould necessarily have to be as great as to displace the most immense\r\nplanet that exists. When this atomic neutral centre is displaced,\r\nthe planet must go with it. The neutral centre carries the full load\r\nof any accumulation from the start, and remains the same, for ever\r\nbalanced in the eternal space.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Keely illustrates his idea of \"a neutral centre\" in this\r\nway:--We will imagine that, after an accumulation of a planet of any\r\ndiameter--say, 20,000 miles more or less, for the size has nothing\r\nto do with the problem--there should be a displacement of all the\r\nmaterial, with the exception of a crust 5000 miles thick, leaving\r\nan intervening void between this crust and a centre of the size of\r\nan ordinary billiard ball, it would then require a force as great\r\nto move this small central mass as it would to move the shell of\r\n5000 miles thickness. Moreover, this small central mass would carry\r\nthe load of this crust for ever, keeping it equi-distant; and there\r\ncould be no opposing power, however great, that could bring them\r\ntogether. The imagination staggers in contemplating the immense load\r\nwhich bears upon this point of centre, where weight ceases. This is\r\nwhat we understand by a neutral centre.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. Keely, in explanation of the working of his engine,\r\nwrites:--In the conception of any machine heretofore constructed, the\r\nmedium for inducing a neutral centre has never been found. If it had,\r\nthe difficulties of perpetual-motion seekers would have ended, and this\r\nproblem would have become an established and operating fact. It would\r\nonly require an introductory impulse of a few pounds, on such a device,\r\nto cause it to run for centuries. In the conception of my vibratory\r\nengine, I did not seek to attain perpetual motion; but a circuit is\r\nformed that actually has a neutral centre, which is in a condition\r\nto be vivified by my vibratory ether, and while under operation, by\r\nsaid substance, is really a machine that is virtually independent of\r\nthe mass (or globe), and it is the wonderful velocity of the vibratory\r\ncircuit which makes it so. Still, with all its perfection, it requires\r\nto be fed with the vibratory ether to make it an independent motor....\r\n\r\nAlluding to his illustration of a neutral centre, Mr. Keely says:--The\r\nman who can, even in a simple way, appreciate this vast problem has\r\nbeen endowed by the Creator with one of the greatest gifts which He\r\ncan bestow upon a mortal. It is well known that all structures require\r\na foundation in strength according to the weight of the mass they\r\nhave to carry, but the foundations of the universe rest on a vacuous\r\npoint far more minute than a molecule; in fact, to express this truth\r\nproperly, on an inter-etheric point, which requires an infinite mind\r\nto understand. To look down into the depths of an etheric centre is\r\nprecisely the same as it would be to search into the broad space of\r\nheaven's ether to find the end; with this difference, that one is\r\nthe positive field, while the other is the negative field....\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. Keely gives some suggestive thoughts as follows:--In seeking\r\nto solve the great problems which have baffled me, from time to time,\r\nin my progressive researches, I have often been struck by the fact that\r\nI have, to all seeming, accidentally tripped over their solution. The\r\nmind of man is not infinite, and it requires an infinite brain to\r\nevolve infinite positions. My highest power of concentration failed\r\nto attain the results which, at last, seeming accident revealed. God\r\nmoves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform; and if He has\r\nchosen me as the tool to carve out certain positions, what credit\r\nhave I? None; and, though it is an exalting thought that He has\r\nsingled me out for a specific work, I know that the finest tool is\r\nof no value without a manipulator. It is the artist who handles it\r\nthat makes it what it is. Indifference to the marvels which surround\r\nus is a deep reproach. If we have neither leisure nor inclination\r\nto strive to unravel some of the mysteries of nature, which task to\r\nthe utmost the highest order of human intelligence, we can at least\r\nexercise and improve our intellectual faculties by making ourselves\r\nacquainted with the operation of agencies already revealed to man;\r\nlearning, by the experience of the past, to be tolerant of all truth;\r\nremembering that one of Nature's agencies, known once as of use only\r\nin awakening men's minds to an awful sense of the Creator's power,\r\nhas now become a patient slave of man's will, rushing upon his errands\r\nwith the speed of light around the inhabited globe....\r\n\r\nIn comparing the tenuity of the atmosphere with that of the etheric\r\nflows, obtained by Mr. Keely from his invention for dissociating\r\nthe molecules of air by vibration, he says, It is as platina to\r\nhydrogen gas. Molecular separation of air brings us to the first\r\nsubdivision only; inter-molecular, to the second; atomic, to the third;\r\ninter-atomic, to the fourth; etheric, to the fifth; and inter-etheric,\r\nto the sixth subdivision, or positive association with luminiferous\r\nether. In my introductory argument I have contended that this is the\r\nvibratory envelope of all atoms. In my definition of atom I do not\r\nconfine myself to the sixth subdivision, where this luminiferous ether\r\nis developed in its crude form, as far as my researches prove. I think\r\nthis idea will be pronounced, by the physicists of the present day,\r\na wild freak of the imagination. Possibly, in time, a light may fall\r\nupon this theory that will bring its simplicity forward for scientific\r\nresearch. At present I can only compare it to some planet in a dark\r\nspace, where the light of the sun of science has not yet reached it....\r\n\r\nI assume that sound, like odour, is a real substance of unknown\r\nand wonderful tenuity, emanating from a body where it has been\r\ninduced by percussion, and throwing out absolute corpuscles of\r\nmatter--inter-atomic particles--with a velocity of 1120 feet per\r\nsecond, in vacuo 20,000. The substance which is thus disseminated is a\r\npart and parcel of the mass agitated, and if kept under this agitation\r\ncontinuously would, in the course of a certain cycle of time, become\r\nthoroughly absorbed by the atmosphere; or, more truly, would pass\r\nthrough the atmosphere to an elevated point of tenuity corresponding\r\nto the condition of subdivision that governs its liberation from its\r\nparent body. The sounds from vibratory forks, set so as to produce\r\netheric chords, while disseminating their compound tones permeate most\r\nthoroughly all substances that come under the range of their atomic\r\nbombardment. The clapping of a bell in vacuo liberates these atoms\r\nwith the same velocity and volume as one in the open air; and were\r\nthe agitation of the bell kept up continuously for a few millions of\r\ncenturies, it would thoroughly return to its primitive element. If\r\nthe chamber were hermetically sealed, and strong enough, the vacuous\r\nvolume surrounding the bell would be brought to a pressure of many\r\nthousands of pounds to the square inch, by the tenuous substance\r\nevolved. In my estimation, sound truly defined is the disturbance\r\nof atomic equilibrium, rupturing actual atomic corpuscles; and the\r\nsubstance thus liberated must certainly be a certain order of etheric\r\nflow. Under these conditions is it unreasonable to suppose that, if\r\nthis flow were kept up, and the body thus robbed of its element, it\r\nwould in time disappear entirely? All bodies are formed primitively\r\nfrom this high tenuous ether, animal, vegetable and mineral, and\r\nthey only return to their high gaseous condition when brought under\r\na state of differential equilibrium.\r\n\r\nAs regards odour, continues Mr. Keely, we can only get some definite\r\nidea of its extreme and wondrous tenuity by taking into consideration\r\nthat a large area of atmosphere can be impregnated for a long series\r\nof years from a single grain of musk; which, if weighed after that\r\nlong interval, will be found to be not appreciably diminished. The\r\ngreat paradox attending the flow of odorous particles is that they\r\ncan be held under confinement in a glass vessel! Here is a substance\r\nof much higher tenuity than the glass that holds it, and yet it\r\ncannot escape. It is as a sieve with its meshes large enough to pass\r\nmarbles, and yet holding fine sand which cannot pass through; in fact,\r\na molecular vessel holding an atomic substance. This is a problem\r\nthat would confound those who stop to recognize it. But infinitely\r\ntenuous as odour is, it holds a very crude relation to the substance\r\nof subdivision that governs a magnetic flow (a flow of sympathy, if\r\nyou please to call it so). This subdivision comes next to sound, but\r\nis above sound. The action of the flow of a magnet coincides somewhat\r\nto the receiving and distributing portion of the human brain, giving\r\noff at all times a depreciating ratio of the amount received. It is a\r\ngrand illustration of the control of mind over matter, which gradually\r\ndepreciates the physical till dissolution takes place. The magnet on\r\nthe same ratio gradually loses its power and becomes inert. If the\r\nrelations that exist between mind and matter could be equated, and so\r\nheld, we would live on in our physical state eternally, as there would\r\nbe no physical depreciation. But this physical depreciation leads,\r\nat its terminus, to the source of a much higher development--viz.,\r\nthe liberation of the pure ether from the crude molecular; which in\r\nmy estimation is to be much desired. Thus God moves in a simple way\r\nHis wonders to perform....\"\r\n\r\nWhen my theoretical exposé is finished and brought out, I shall\r\nbe ready for the attacks that will be made upon it, and able to\r\ndemonstrate what I assert. One would think that modern physicists,\r\nknowing the lesson taught by the disastrous overthrow of the primitive\r\nsystem of astronomy, would be somewhat cautious in reference to jeering\r\nat any announcement of scientific research, however preposterous,\r\nwithout first carefully weighing its claims. It is my belief that there\r\nare many to-day who occupy positions as professors in our colleges and\r\nin universities abroad, who for bigotry and ignorance can discount the\r\nopinion of the religionists of the dark ages; but those to whom has\r\nbeen given mental force to boldly investigate new truths in science may\r\ncongratulate themselves upon the fact that there are investigators of\r\ntruth who are not afraid to acknowledge its claims, in whatever garb it\r\nmay appear, welcoming whatever new message it may have to deliver....\r\n\r\nProfessor Rücker, in closing his address read at the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in 1891, said:--\r\n\r\n\"In studies such as these we are passing from the investigation of\r\nthe properties of ordinary matter to those of the ether, which may\r\nperhaps be the material of which matter is composed. We may some day\r\nbe able to control and use it, as we now control and use steam.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly fifteen years, Keely constructed engines of various models,\r\nwith this end in view, before he discovered that it is impossible to\r\nuse the ether in any other way than as a medium for the energy that\r\nhe is now experimenting with; and which he defines, in its present\r\noperation, as a condition of sympathetic vibration associated with\r\nthe polar stream positively and negatively.\r\n\r\nShould Keely succeed in controlling and directing this subtle energy,\r\nwe shall then be able to \"hook our machinery on to the machinery\r\nof nature.\" A writer in the Nineteenth Century says,--\"Whether the\r\nmolecules or particles of what we know as matter are independent\r\nmatter, or whether they are ether-whirlpools; we know that they keep\r\nup an incessant hammering one on another, and thus on everything\r\nin space. Professor Crookes has shown that the forces contained in\r\nthis bombardment are immensely greater than any forces we have yet\r\nhandled.... It has also been found that the vibrations keep time in\r\nsome unknown way with the vibrations of solid matter.\"\r\n\r\nThus it is seen that Keely is not the only man of science who is trying\r\nto effect a passage over the untrodden wild lying between acoustics\r\nand music: \"that Siberian bog where whole armies of scientific\r\nmusicians and musical men of science have sunk, without filling it\r\nup.\" Helmholtz, it is said, has, by a series of daring strides,\r\nmade a passage for himself; while Keely stands alone in seeking\r\nto build a solid causeway; over which all the nations of the earth\r\nmay pass in safety, to the \"new order of things,\" that lies in this\r\n\"land of promise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nVIBRATORY PHYSICS.--THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN MIND AND MATTER.\r\n\r\n        The elements of Nature are made of the will of God.--Hermes\r\n        Trismegistus.\r\n\r\n        Newton and Faraday have indicated how force instead of\r\n        leaping over nothing, acting at a distance, is transmitted\r\n        consecutively through the ethereal substance.\r\n\r\n        We must become as little children, not presuming to think of\r\n        causes efficient, or causes final; for these are things we\r\n        cannot grasp; but reverently and patiently waiting until,\r\n        like a revelation, the hidden link between the familiar\r\n        and the unfamiliar flashes into our mind, and thus an\r\n        additional step is gained in the endless series of successive\r\n        generalizations.--The Rev. H. W. Watson, F.R.S., President\r\n        of the Birmingham Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\n        All truth comes by inspiration.--Scripture.\r\n\r\n        There is but one Deity, the Supreme Spirit: he is of the same\r\n        nature as the soul of man.-- Vedic Theology.\r\n\r\n        As for truth it endureth and is always strong, it liveth and\r\n        conquereth for evermore.--Esdras.\r\n\r\n        Everything happens according to the will of God and has\r\n        its appointed time, which can neither be hastened nor\r\n        avoided.--Mohammed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the paper of the Rev. H. W. Watson, on \"The Progress of Science,\r\nits Conditions and Limitations,\" he tells us that every thinking man\r\nrecognizes the subjective Self and the objective non-Self, and that\r\nthis non-Self, so far as it manifests its existence through the senses,\r\nis the object of investigation of natural philosophers; but he admits\r\nthat their investigations have not bestowed upon modern science any\r\nresults to justify the language of causation. Universal gravitation\r\nis declared to be a vast generalization, telling us that there is\r\nno more, but yet just as much, of mystery in the whole sequence of\r\nastronomical phenomena, as in the most humdrum processes of every-day\r\nexperiences. The unfamiliar has been explained by the familiar, and\r\nboth remain in their original mystery. The mystery, attendant upon\r\ngravitation, Kepler prophesied would be revealed to man in this age:\r\nand the cautious and inductive investigations which Keely has been\r\npursuing, since 1888, have enabled him to demonstrate that the unknown\r\nforce, which for fifteen years had baffled all his skill, is the same\r\ncondition of sympathetic vibration which controls nature's highest and\r\nmost general operations:--the identical force which Faraday divined\r\nwhen he wrote, in 1836: \"Thus, either present elements are the true\r\nelements, or else there is the probability before us of obtaining\r\nsome more high and general power of nature even than electricity,\r\nand which at the same time might reveal to us an entirely new grade\r\nof the elements of matter, now hidden from our view and almost from\r\nour suspicion.\"\r\n\r\nIt was good advice given by the late Professor Clifford,--\"Before\r\nteaching any doctrine wait until the nature of the evidence can\r\nbe understood.\" But without attempting to teach Keely's system of\r\nvibratory physics, we may look into some of his views, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that, whatever truths there may be in them, they are\r\napproached from such a different standpoint, than that of the platform\r\nof mechanical physics, that it is utterly impossible to bring them\r\ninto any definite relations with each other. [13] Dr. Gérard, of Paris,\r\nin his work on \"Nervous Force,\" writes of this founder of a new system\r\nof philosophy: \"The force discovered by Keely appears to me to be so\r\nentirely the counterpart of what passes primarily in the brain cells\r\nthat we see in him but a plagiarist of cerebral dynamics--that is, he\r\nhas had but to copy the delicate human mechanism to make a wonderful\r\ndiscovery; probably, the greatest the world has ever known. The word\r\nplagiarist has no deprecatory meaning as applied to the great American\r\ninventor, for he must possess an extraordinary power of assimilation\r\nto read so fluently the open book of nature, and to be able wisely\r\nto interpret her admirable laws: it is, therefore, with profound\r\nadmiration that I here render homage to this man of science.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gérard's work treats of the production of electricity in the nerve\r\ncentres, and its accumulation in storage. He says that fifty years\r\nago it would have been difficult to explain this fact intelligently;\r\nbut thanks to the scientific progress of the period, everyone now knows\r\nhow electricity is produced, and how applied, to use in lighting our\r\nhouses. He continues: \"Let us say, then, in few words, how matters\r\nstand, for it will serve to illustrate how it is with our brain, the\r\nmechanism of which is precisely the same--only that our apparatus is\r\nmuch more perfect and much less costly.\r\n\r\n\"A dynamo-electric machine is placed at any given spot; its object,\r\nbeing put in action, is to withdraw from the earth its neutral\r\nelectricity, to decompose it into its two conditions and to collect,\r\nupon accumulators, the electricity thus separated. As soon as the\r\naccumulators are charged, the electricity is disposable; that is,\r\nour lamps can be lighted. But what is marvellous in all this is that\r\nthe forces of nature can be transformed at will. Should we not wish\r\nfor light, we turn a knob and we have sound, heat, motion, chemical\r\naction, magnetism. Little seems wanting to create intelligence,\r\nso entirely do these accumulated forces lend themselves to all the\r\ntransformations which their engineer may imagine and desire. But let\r\nus consider how greatly superior is our cerebral mechanism to all\r\ninvented mechanism. In order to light a theatre we require a wide\r\nspace, a dynamo-electric machine of many horse-power, accumulators\r\nfilling many receptacles, a considerable expense in fuel, and clever\r\nmechanicians. In the human organism these engines are in miniature,\r\none décimêtre cube is all the space occupied by our brain; no wheels,\r\nno pistons, nothing to drive the apparatus, we suffice ourselves. In\r\nthis sense, each of us can say, like the philosopher Biaz:--Omnia\r\nmecum porto. Our cerebral organ not only originates motion, heat,\r\nsound, light, chemical actions, magnetism; but it produces psychic\r\nforces, such as will, reasoning, judgment, hatred, love, and the\r\nwhole series of intellectual faculties. They are all derived from\r\nthe same source, and are always identical to each other, so long as\r\nthe cerebral apparatus remains intact. The variations of our health\r\nalone are capable of causing a variation in the intensity and quality\r\nof our productions.\r\n\r\n\"With a maximum of physical and moral health, we produce a maximum of\r\nphysical and moral results. Our manual labour and our intellectual\r\nproductions are always exactly proportionate to the integrity of\r\nour mechanism.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gérard has, it will be seen, grasped the same truth that Buckle\r\nenunciated in his lecture, The Influence of Women on the Progress of\r\nKnowledge, when he affirmed that not one single discovery that had ever\r\nbeen made has been connected with the laws of the mind that made it:\r\ndeclaring that until this connection is ascertained our knowledge has\r\nno sure basis, as \"the laws of nature have their sole seat, origin,\r\nand function in the human mind.\" This is the foundation stone of\r\nvibratory physics, that all force is mind force.\r\n\r\nAll the forces of nature, writes Keely, proceed from the one governing\r\nforce; the source of all life, of all energy. These sympathetic flows,\r\nor streams of force, each consists of three currents, harmonic,\r\nenharmonic, and dominant; this classification governing all orders\r\nof positive and negative radiation. The sympathetic flow called\r\n\"Animal Magnetism\" is the transmissive link of sympathy in the fourth,\r\nor inter-atomic, subdivision of matter. It is the most intricate of\r\nproblems to treat philosophically; isolated as it is from all approach\r\nby any of the prescribed rules in \"the orthodox scheme of physics.\" It\r\nturns upon the interchangeable subdivision of inter-atomic acting\r\nagency, or the force of the mind. The action of this etheric flow,\r\nin substances of all kinds, is according to the character of the\r\nmolecular interferences which exist in the volume of their atomic\r\ngroupings. These interferences proceed from some description of atomic\r\nchemical nature, which tend to vary the uniformity of structure\r\nin the atomic triplets of each molecule. If these groupings were\r\nabsolutely uniform there would be but one substance in nature, and\r\nall beings inhabiting this globe would be simultaneously impressed\r\nwith the same feelings and actuated by the same desires; but nature\r\nhas produced unlimited variety. Science, as yet, has not made so much\r\nas an introductory attempt to solve this problem of \"the mind flow,\"\r\nbut has left it with the hosts of impostors, who always beset any\r\nfield that trenches on the land of marvel.\r\n\r\nProfessor Olive Lodge, in his address before the British Association,\r\nat Cardiff, said: \"Let me try to state what this field is, the\r\nexploration of which is regarded as so dangerous. I might call\r\nit the borderland of physics and psychology. I might call it the\r\nconnection between life and energy; or the connection between mind\r\nand matter. It is an intermediate region, bounded on the north by\r\npsychology, on the south by physics, on the east by physiology, and\r\non the west by pathology and medicine. An occasional psychologist\r\nhas groped down into it and become a metaphysician. An occasional\r\nphysicist has wandered up into it and lost his base, to the horror of\r\nhis quondam brethren. Biologists mostly look at it askance, or deny\r\nits existence. A few medical practitioners, after long maintenance\r\nof a similar attitude, have begun to annex a portion of its western\r\nfrontier.... Why not leave it to the metaphysicians? I say it has\r\nbeen left to them long enough. They have explored it with insufficient\r\nequipment. Their methods are not our methods; they are unsatisfactory\r\nto us, as physicists. We prefer to creep slowly from our base of\r\nphysical knowledge; to engineer carefully as we go, establishing\r\nforts, constructing roads, and thoroughly exploring the country,\r\nmaking a progress very slow but very lasting. The psychologists from\r\ntheir side may meet us. I hope they will; but one or the other of us\r\nought to begin....\"\r\n\r\nIn America, we have Buchanan and many others investigating in this\r\nfield; and Dr. Bowne, the orthodox Dean of the Boston University,\r\nin his answer to Herbert Spencer, answering the question,\r\n\"What is Force?\" tells us: \"Not gravitation, nor electricity,\r\nnor magnetism, nor chemical affinity, but will, is the typical\r\nidea of force. Self-determination, volition is the essence of the\r\nonly causation we know. Will is the sum-total of the dynamic idea:\r\nit either stands for that or nothing. Now science professes itself\r\nunable to interpret nature without this metaphysical idea of power. The\r\nexperiments made by Professor Barker and others, which are said to\r\nestablish the identity of heat and mental force, really prove only\r\na correlation between heat and the nervous action which attends\r\nthinking. Nervous action and heat correlate, but the real point is\r\nto prove that nervous action and mental force correlate. This has\r\nnever been done.\"\r\n\r\n\"The concept of will,\" says Arthur Schopenhauer, \"has hitherto commonly\r\nbeen subordinated to that of force; but I reverse the matter entirely,\r\nand desire that every force in nature be thought of as will. It\r\nmust not be supposed that this is mere verbal quibbling and of no\r\nconsequence: rather it is of the greatest significance and importance.\"\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that the field which Professor Lodge, with rare\r\ncourage, invited his fellow-physicists to enter and bring with them\r\ntheir appropriate methods of investigation (unless these philosophers\r\nare astray) may prove to be \"the immense and untrodden field\" which\r\nBuckle said must be conquered before Science can arrogate to herself\r\nany knowledge of nature's laws that is not purely empirical. A\r\nlittle reflection will enable the average mind to see in the signs\r\nof the times a tendency to movements on a grander scale, such as are\r\ninvolved in the higher view which Keely is himself now taking since\r\nhis researches have extended beyond the order he was pursuing when\r\nhe was thinking only of mechanical success.\r\n\r\nMan's progress has been so enormous that nothing too extravagant can be\r\nimagined for the future, when once psychical investigation is conducted\r\nas proposed by Professor Lodge; who is trying to unravel the mystery\r\nas to what force is, and by what means exerted. There is something\r\nhere not definitely provided for in the orthodox scheme of physics;\r\nbut Keely's themes explain this mystery. \"Luminiferous ether,\" he\r\nwrites, \"or celestial mind force, a compound inter-etheric element,\r\nis the substance of which everything visible is composed. It is the\r\ngreat sympathetic protoplastic element; life itself. Consequently,\r\nour physical organisms are composed of this element. This focalizing,\r\nor controlling media, of the physical, has its seat in the cerebral\r\nconvolutions; from which sympathetic radiation emanates. This\r\nsympathetic outreach is mind flow proper, or will force; sympathetic\r\npolarization to produce action; sympathetic depolarization to\r\nneutralize it. Polar and depolar differentiation, resulting in\r\nmotion. The true protoplastic element sympathetically permeates all\r\nforms and conditions of matter; having, for its attendants, gravity,\r\nelectricity, and magnetism; the triple conditions born in itself. In\r\nfact, it is the soul of matter; the element from which all forms of\r\nmotion receive their introductory impulse.\"\r\n\r\nNot long since, Mr. Keely was congratulated upon having secured\r\nthe attention of men of science, connected with the University of\r\nPennsylvania, to his work of research. Now, you will be known as\r\na great discoverer, not as Keely the motor-man, said one of the\r\nprofessors present. Keely answered, I have discovered so little,\r\nin comparison with what remains to be discovered, that I cannot call\r\nmyself a discoverer. Another of the professors present took Keely by\r\nthe hand and said, You are a great discoverer.\r\n\r\nHad the discoverer of this unknown force not been dependent upon a\r\ncompany, \"a ring,\" for funds to pursue his investigations, scientists\r\nwould have better understood the nature of this work at an earlier\r\nstage of his experimental research; but following close upon Keely's\r\nproduction of the latent force carried in all forms of aggregated\r\nmatter, he became entangled in the meshes of an organization that\r\ncared nothing for science, and a great deal for the wealth which,\r\nit was seen by practical business men, must sooner or later accrue\r\nas the result of a costless motive power. In other words, those who\r\ninterested themselves in Keely's discoveries were interested solely\r\nin their marketable value; or if there chanced to be one who was\r\nnot so interested, that one was not of sufficient influence in the\r\nscientific world to be able to induce capitalists to come forward and\r\ncontribute towards saving the discovery to this age, by protecting\r\nthe discoverer from the persecution that he was subjected to from\r\nthose who had the management of the commercial affairs of the company.\r\n\r\nAratus, the poet of Cilicia, the author of \"Phenomena,\" wrote, \"We\r\nare the offspring of God;\" and St. Paul, quoting Aratus, continued,\r\n\"In Him we live and move and have our being.\" From that hour,\r\ndown the blood-stained path of the age to the present, there have\r\nbeen men, spiritually endowed, who have taught that He who created,\r\ncommands and governs, the universe, sustains it by the power of His\r\nwill; and that were it not for the celestial streams of radiation,\r\nthis superhuman influence, constantly flowing into all created forms,\r\nthe universe would pass out of existence, would perish in a moment. So\r\nwell did Macvicar, the great Scotch divine, understand this conception\r\nof Deity, that he wrote, \"The nearer we ascend to the fountain-head of\r\nbeing and of action the more magical must everything inevitably become;\r\nfor that fountain-head is pure volition. And pure volition as a cause\r\nis precisely what is meant by magic; for by magic is merely meant a\r\nmode of producing a phenomenon without mechanical appliances--that is,\r\nwithout that seeming continuity of resisting parts and that leverage\r\nwhich satisfy our muscular sense and our imagination, and bring the\r\nphenomenon into the category of what we call 'the natural;' that is,\r\nthe sphere of the elastic, the gravitating; the sphere into which the\r\n'vis inertiæ' is alone admitted.\"\r\n\r\nWe call this the sphere of the natural; but, when we come to\r\nhigher workings of natural laws, with which we are not familiar, we\r\ndesignate them as \"supernatural;\" and scientists witnessing some of\r\nKeely's experiments, like those of overcoming gravity, of rotation\r\nof the needle of a compass, [14] of the disintegration of water,\r\netc., and not believing in any workings of laws unknown to them,\r\nfollowed in the footsteps, still unobliterated, of the narrow-minded,\r\nbigoted persecutors of Galileo; and have denounced Keely as \"a\r\nmodern Cagliostro.\" When men of more extended research have been\r\non the eve of investigating for themselves they have, until 1889,\r\nbeen deterred from doing so by the representations made to them\r\nthat Keely was \"using compressed air to humbug his audiences.\" Until\r\nProfessor Leidy and Dr. Willcox gave their attention to Mr. Keely's\r\nclaims as the discoverer of a new form of energy, the way was not\r\nopen for Mr. Keely to disclose his conjectures, his hypotheses and\r\nhis theories. Regrettable as this fact has seemed to be, it is now\r\nseen that any previous revelation of his discovery, other than to\r\nscientists, might have been premature; so little did Keely himself\r\nknow, until within two years, of the developments he has at last\r\nreached in his work of evolution. The time was not ripe for the\r\ndisclosure.\r\n\r\nIt is a canon of science that molecular aggregation generally involves\r\ndissipation of energy. On the contrary, for more than fifteen years\r\nKeely has demonstrated that all molecular aggregation is attended\r\nwith an absorption of energy; relieving by vibratory power the latent\r\nforce held in a few drops of water and showing thereby a pressure of\r\nfrom ten to fifteen tons per square inch; claiming that resultant\r\ndevelopment of any force and of all forces is only accomplished by\r\nconditions that awaken the latent energy carried during molecular\r\naggregation. It is conceded by those most conversant with the nature\r\nof Keely's discoveries that he must either create force, or liberate\r\nlatent energy. As Omnipotence alone creates, it follows that science\r\nmust be wrong in two of her most fundamental laws; one relating to the\r\nindivisibility of the atom; the other to the dissipation of energy in\r\nmolecular aggregation. This, Keely establishes in the one experiment\r\nof disintegration of water, releasing from three drops the latent\r\nenergy carried, during and from the time of molecular aggregation,\r\nand showing a pressure of fifteen tons to the square inch. Therefore,\r\nit is not \"a waste of time and thought\" to give attention to Keely's\r\ntheories, and to investigate from the standpoint of vibratory physics,\r\ninstead of setting limits to the operations of Nature and the power\r\nof the Almighty from the narrow platform of mechanical physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeely's Theories.\r\n\r\nThe action of Nature's sympathetic flows, writes Keely, regulates the\r\ndifferential oscillatory range of motion of the planetary masses as\r\nregards their approach toward and recession from each other. These\r\nflows may also be compared to the flow of the magnet which permeates\r\nthe field, existing between the molecules themselves, sensitizing\r\nthe combined neutral centres of the molecules without disturbing,\r\nin the least, the visible molecular mass itself. In the planetary\r\nmasses--balanced as it were in the scales of universal space, like\r\nsoap-bubbles floating in a field of atmospheric air--the concentration\r\nof these sympathetic streams evolves the universal power which\r\nmoves them in their oscillating range of motion to and from each\r\nother. This sympathetic triple stream focalizes and defocalizes\r\non the neutrals of all such masses; polarizing and depolarizing,\r\npositive and negative action, planetary rotation, etc., etc. It is\r\nthus that all the conditions governing light, heat, life, vegetation,\r\nmotion, are all derived from the velocity of the positive and negative\r\ninterchange of celestial sympathy with the terrestrial.\r\n\r\nEvery harmonious condition of Nature's evolutions is governed by one\r\nincontrovertible law; that of concordant assimilative harmony. This\r\nconcordant key is the ruling one over all the antagonistic,\r\nnegative, discordant ones; the one that diverts the disturbance of\r\nsympathetic equilibrium to one general concentrative centre for\r\nredistribution. Harmony concentrates, harmony distributes. The\r\nfocalizing point of concordant sympathetic concentration is the\r\npercussive electric field, where the velocity of its sympathetic\r\nstreams rebounds with a power that throws them far out into universal\r\nspace; and so far beyond their equative centre of equilibrium as to\r\nbring them in sympathy with the universal attraction of the combined\r\nneutral centres of all planetary masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSympathetic Streams which Control the Action and Reaction of all\r\nVisible Forms of Matter.\r\n\r\nWhat is light and heat, and how are they evolved? and why are they\r\nso intensely perceptible as emanating from the solar world?\r\n\r\nLight and heat, considered theoretically, belong to the highest orders\r\nof the phenomenal. They can only be accounted for by the velocity\r\nof sympathetic streams, as interchangeable to and from centres of\r\nnegative and attractive focalization. In considering the velocity\r\nof vibration, as associated with the projection of a ray of light,\r\nto be at least one hundred thousand billions per second, it is easy\r\nto account for the origin and demonstration of these two elements by\r\nthe action of celestial sympathetic streams.\r\n\r\n1st. Light and heat are not evolved until the force of the vibratory\r\nsympathetic stream, from the neutral centre of the sun, comes into\r\natomic percussive action against the molecular atmosphere or envelope\r\nof our planet. The visibility of the planets can only be accounted\r\nfor in this way, some in a great degree, some in less. Innumerable\r\nthousands, it may be, remain invisible to us by not having the\r\nconditions surrounding them, and associated with them, which favour\r\nthe atomic and molecular antagonistic friction necessary to make\r\nthem visible. The velocity of a steel ball passing through the\r\natmospheric envelope, at a speed of thousands of billions times\r\nless than an etheric sympathetic stream, would be dissipated into\r\nvapour in an indefinite period of a second of time. Light and heat,\r\nin a certain sense, are one and the same; light giving heat, and heat\r\ngiving light. The whole mystery, as associated with their evolution,\r\nis explained by the bombardment of the sympathetic etheric stream\r\non the dense portion of the molecular, in seeking the sympathetic,\r\nconcordant, neutral centre of the planetary mass that surrounds the\r\npoint of focalization.\r\n\r\nThe positive and negative interchange of this true sympathetic stream\r\nkeeps intact the magnetic force of the polar envelope of the earth;\r\nmaking it, as it were, a great magnet of itself. The fact of this\r\nmagnetic force being universally present, on and in our planet,\r\nproves the immeasurable speed and power of etheric sympathetic\r\ninterchange. Thus it is that, from the velocity of these sympathetic\r\nrays, the earth's standard of heat and light is evolved and kept in\r\nbalance. This interchange of sympathetic radiation, between the solar\r\nworld and its system of planets, equates the sympathetic volume by\r\nthe reception of the full amount expended on sympathetic distribution;\r\nthus showing the never-ending restoration of equilibrium by the same\r\nmedium that disturbs it during intermittent sympathetic action. There\r\nare very many facts in vibratory physics which prove that the volume\r\nof heat, supposed by many to emanate from the sun, if concentrated\r\nupon a centre of the volume represented by the sun, would give enough\r\nfocal force, if projected upon the system of planets that is under\r\nits control, to vaporize them in one month's time. A ray of heat one\r\nbillion times greater than the whole volume of the sun represents\r\ncould not pass through the dark vacuous boundaries which lie between\r\nus and the sun without being neutralized and absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Electricity?\r\n\r\nElectricity is the result of three differentiated sympathetic\r\nflows, combining the celestial and terrestrial flows by an order of\r\nassimilation negatively attractive in its character. It is one of\r\nNature's efforts to restore attractive differentiation. In analyzing\r\nthis triple union in its vibratory philosophy, I find the highest\r\norder of perfection in this assimilative action of Nature. The\r\nwhole condition is atomic, and is the introductory one which has\r\nan affinity for terrestrial centres, uniting magnetically with the\r\nPolar stream; in other words, uniting with the Polar stream by neutral\r\naffinity. The magnetic or electric forces of the earth are thus kept\r\nin stable equilibrium by this triune force, and the chords of this\r\nforce may be expressed as 1st, the dominant, 2nd, the harmonic,\r\nand 3rd, the enharmonic. The value of each is, one to the other,\r\nin the rates of figures, true thirds. E flat--transmissive chord or\r\ndominant; A flat--harmonic; A double flat--enharmonic. The unition of\r\nthe two prime thirds is so rapid, when the negative and the positive\r\nconditions reach a certain range of vibratory motion, as to be compared\r\nto an explosion. During this action the positive electric stream\r\nis liberated and immediately seeks its neutral terrestrial centre,\r\nor centre of highest attraction.\r\n\r\nThe power of attractive vibration of the solar forces is the great\r\ncoincident towards which the terrestrial-magnetic-sympathetic flow\r\nis diverted. This force is the celestial current that makes up\r\nthe prime third of the triple association. It also induces aqueous\r\ndisintegration and thermal concentration, the two prime conductors\r\ntowards this coincident chord of sympathy with itself. Without this\r\naqueous disintegration there would be no connective link between the\r\ncelestial and terrestrial. There would exist nothing but a condition\r\nof luminous radiation on the order of the aurora--a reaching out for\r\nthe concordant without any sympathetic diversion to create unstable\r\nequilibrium of terrestrial magnetism. In fact, under such a condition,\r\nthe absence of the sun on one side, or the absence of water on the\r\nother, the magnetic or electric force would remain in a stable state\r\nof equilibrium, or the highest order of the chaotic. Disturbance\r\nof equilibrium and sympathetic equation constitute the dual power\r\nthat governs all the varied forms of life and motion which exist\r\nterrestrially, of which the electric or magnetic is the prime mover\r\nand regulator. All electrical action, no matter of what character,\r\nhas its sympathetic birth by the intervention of that current\r\nof the triune flow, which I call the dominant, with the Polar\r\nharmonic current; all sympathetic flows being composed of three\r\ncurrents. They become associative one with the other only near\r\nthe junction of terrestrial interference. The great vacuous field\r\nwhich exists between the planetary ranges holds this portion of\r\nthe etheric flow free of all antagonism, molecularly or otherwise,\r\ntill the associative point is reached; so wonderfully planned by\r\nthe Great Creator, for instant electric evolution and assimilation\r\nwith terrestrial centres of attraction. I call this intervention,\r\natomic-inter-molecular and molecular density. The combination of\r\nthe action of the triune sympathetic-celestial stream with the same\r\nintervening medium induces heat and light, as the resultant of these\r\ncorpuscular conflictions with sympathetic celestial and terrestrial\r\nfocalized centres of neutral radiation. I do not recognize electricity,\r\nnor light, nor heat as coming from the sun. These conditions, according\r\nto my theories, emanate from atomic and inter-atomic interference\r\non induced molecular vibration, by sympathetic etheric vibration,\r\nthe celestial-attractive being the prime mover. In my estimation\r\nthis is not at all phenomenal; it is only phenomenal as far as the\r\nknowledge of its action in mechanical physics is concerned. Physicists\r\nhave been working in the wrong direction to lead them to associate\r\nthemselves with Nature's sympathetic evolutions. [15] The expression\r\n\"Electricity attracts at a distance\" is as bad as, if not worse than,\r\nthe \"microbe of the magnet.\" Clerk Maxwell seems, when theorizing\r\non sound transmission by an atmospheric medium, not to have taken\r\ninto consideration the philosophy attending the phenomena of the\r\norigination of electric streams in celestial space. Light is one of\r\nthe prominent evolved mediums in electric action, and is evolved by\r\ncorpuscular bombardment induced by sympathetic streams acting between\r\nthe neutral centres of planetary masses, all of which are under a\r\ncondition of unstable equilibrium. These unstable conditions were\r\nborn in them, and were thus designed by the Architect of Creation\r\nin order to perpetuate the connective link between the dispersing\r\npositive and the attractive negative. The action that induces this\r\nlink I call sympathetic planetary oscillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttraction, Propulsion, &c.\r\n\r\nThe action of the magnetic flow is dual in its evolution, both\r\nattractive and propulsive. The inclination of the plane on which the\r\nsubtle stream moves, either to the right or to the left, has nothing to\r\ndo with positive or negative conditions. The difference in conditions\r\nof what is called, by electricians, positive and negative electricity,\r\nis the difference between receptive and propulsive vibrations. They\r\ncan be right or left receptive, or right or left propulsive. The\r\npositive vibrations are the radiating; the negative vibrations are\r\nthe ones that are attracted toward the neutral centre.\r\n\r\nThe negative-sympathetic polar stream is the magnetic flow proper,\r\nand it is in sympathetic coincidence with the second atomic flow; the\r\nelectric current is the first and second order of atomic vibration,\r\na dual force, the flow of which is too tenuous to displace the\r\nmolecules. It can no more do so than the flow from a magnet can\r\ndisplace the molecules of a glass plate when it is passed under it. The\r\nflow from a magnet is too fine to disturb the plate molecules, but\r\npasses as freely between them as a current of air would through a\r\ncoarse sieve.\r\n\r\nLike poles do not repel each other, simply because there is a perfect\r\nsympathetic equation between them; the same in unlike poles. If a\r\ndifferentiation of 33 1/3 against 100 is established between them,\r\nwhether like or unlike, they become attractive to each other. They\r\nbecome repellent after differentiating them, 66 2/3 of the one against\r\n100 of the other, by sympathetic vibration.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration even the introductory conditions of the\r\netheric stage, etheric vibration has proved to me that the higher the\r\nvelocity of its rotating stream the greater is its tendency towards the\r\nneutral centre or centre of sympathetic coincidence. Were it otherwise,\r\nhow could there ever be any planetary formations or the building up\r\nof visible structures? If a billiard ball were rotated to a certain\r\nvelocity, it would separate in pieces, and the pieces would fly off\r\nin a tangent; but if it were a ball of ether, the higher the velocity\r\nof rotation the stronger would be the tendency of its corpuscules to\r\nseek its centre of neutrality, and to hold together.\r\n\r\nIt is not a magnetic force that is borne on the etheric atom which\r\ngives it its power to draw to it streams of coincidence. The magnet\r\nis only susceptive to certain aggregated forms of matter; iron,\r\nfor instance, and its preparations.\r\n\r\nAll moving bodies of visible matter produce heat as according to\r\ntheir velocity. The flow of gases only induces thermal reduction from\r\nmolecular friction. By this term it must not be understood that the\r\nmolecules actually come in contact, and rub against each other. There\r\nis no pressure, however great, that can cause molecular contact. The\r\narea of the volume of the molecule can be reduced by enormous\r\npressure, and the tension thus brought to bear on their rotating\r\nenvelopes induces heat. The heat thus induced is a positive proof of\r\nthe wonderful velocity of the etheric envelope. If the molecules were\r\ndead--which is an infinite impossibility--to sympathetic vibration,\r\nand without a rotatory envelope if all the pressure possible to\r\nconceive were brought to bear upon them, it would not induce the\r\nslightest thermal change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnergy.\r\n\r\nEnergy is a sympathetic condition inherent in all forms of aggregated\r\nmatter, visible and invisible. It is ever present, in its latent\r\ncondition, and is aroused by the sympathetic disturbers of its\r\nequilibrium. By this conservation it becomes transferable. The\r\nsympathetic correlation of will-force in the cerebral convolutionary\r\ncentres transfers its energy to the physical organism.\r\n\r\nBring a steel rod in contact with a magnet, and the latent energy in\r\nthe rod is brought into action without its becoming impregnated by\r\nits magnetic exciter. Energy is an infinite latent force. If it did\r\nnot exist it could not be generated. Consequently, there would be no\r\nenergy to lose nor to conserve. The volume of latent energy in the\r\netheric domain never increases nor ever grows less. It will remain\r\nthe same, as yesterday to-day and for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInaudible Vibrations.\r\n\r\nNature has established her sympathetic concordants from the birth of\r\nthe neutral centres of the planets. This is gravity; therefore gravity\r\nis fixed, inherent. There is no flight of gravity. The difference in\r\nthe condition of the sympathetic nerve centres, and the variations in\r\nthe chord aggregation of the masses, as established in the man or woman\r\nat birth, constitutes the molecular condition of the individual. The\r\nmolecular state of animals, vegetables, and minerals, depends upon\r\nthe aggregation of their chord centres. It is impossible to make two\r\ncoins from one die the same in its molecular aggregation. The mere\r\npicking up of a coin and replacing it causes billions of molecules to\r\nbe lost. This produces a change in the chord of mass of the coin. As\r\nthis fact has only been developed by persistent progressive research,\r\nit is quite easy to comprehend the nature of the difficulties that\r\nlie in the way of perfecting devices for the guidance of artificers\r\nand mechanics, whereby they can bring a proper vibratory action\r\ninto play to induce positive sympathetic transmission. In order to\r\ntransmit my knowledge by demonstration it will be necessary to have\r\nmuch more perfect instruments than those crude devices which I first\r\nconstructed for my researches. One of my perfected instruments shows\r\nto the eye, in the molecular effects produced by a certain order\r\nof vibration, when the chord of harmony is established between two\r\nneutral centres. Another, when connected with the sympathizer, denotes\r\naccurately, by the colour of a certain sound or combination of sounds\r\nthe number of vibrations that are necessary to induce certain effects\r\nof mechanical combinations.\r\n\r\nInaudible vibrations are tested by the magnetic needle and sound\r\ncolours. Every gaseous molecule is a resonator of itself and\r\nis sensitive to any and all sounds induced, whether accordant or\r\ndiscordant. At the normal density of the atmosphere we hear a volume\r\nof sound, focalized by the combined association of every molecule\r\nbrought under sound influence. When we reduce the atmospheric volume\r\nof a chamber to 50/100, then the ear is sensitive to the reduction\r\nof the acoustic force evolved on the same ratio, and so on, until\r\nsound becomes inaudible. This inaudibility to our organ of hearing is\r\nno proof whatever of any reduction of the acoustic force evolved on\r\nthe introductory impulse given to the bell. It is only a proof that\r\nthe number of the molecules left for the acoustic force to act upon\r\nhas been so reduced by increasing the vacuum, that the concentration\r\nof sound from the diminished number cannot be heard. The ear is not\r\nsusceptible to the acoustic force emanating from one molecule, nor\r\neven from the concentration of one hundred millions of billions of\r\nmolecules. The highest vacuum that can be induced, taking but a cubic\r\ninch in volume to act upon, will leave a residual number of molecules\r\none hundred billion times as great as the above given number, and yet\r\nbe perfectly inaudible when all their acoustic forces are focalized.\r\n\r\nThe audible has been conquered in my instruments to that extent which\r\nbrings me into sympathetic contact with the inaudible, the vitalized\r\nconditions of which as regards sympathetic union with the terrestrial\r\nare the pure and only essentials necessary towards establishing the\r\nsensitive link, between the instrument and terrestrial chord-masses,\r\nin order to run sympathetic machinery. But there is still before me a\r\nvast region to be explored before the keystone of this sympathetic arch\r\nis set in position to carry the high order of sympathetic transfer that\r\nI aim at. I have every reason to hope that when I have mastered these\r\nmechanical difficulties I shall be able to control this most subtle of\r\nNature's forces. When this is done, the commercial engine will soon\r\nfollow. There is no truer nor quicker way to reach that end than the\r\none I am now pursuing. My obligations on this line once fulfilled,\r\nI shall be at liberty to turn my attention to the consideration\r\nof the mental forces associated with the physical, and in fact the\r\nsolution of the mechanical problem is one and the same in principle,\r\nas is the physical and mental. When one is solved all is solved. The\r\nconvolutions which exist in the cerebral field are entirely governed\r\nby the sympathetic conditions that surround them.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The force which binds the atoms, which controls secreting glands,\r\n    Is the same that guides the planets, acting by divine commands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll abnormal discordant aggregations in these resonating convolutions\r\nproduce differentiation to concordant transmission; and according\r\nas these differentiations exist in volume, so the transmissions\r\nare discordantly transferred, producing antagonism to pure physical\r\naction. Thus, in motor ataxy, a differentiation of the minor thirds of\r\nthe posterior parietal lobule produces the same condition between the\r\nretractors and exteriors of the leg and foot, and thus the control of\r\nthe proper movements is lost through this differentiation. The same\r\ntruth can be universally applied to any of the cerebral convolutions\r\nthat are in a state of differential harmony to the mass of immediate\r\ncerebral surroundings. Taking the cerebral condition of the whole mass\r\nas one, it is subservient to one general head centre; although as many\r\nneutrals are represented as there are convolutions. The introductory\r\nminors are controlled by the molecular; the next progressive third by\r\nthe atomic; and the high third by the etheric. All these progressive\r\nlinks have their positive, negative, and neutral position. When we\r\ntake into consideration the structural condition of the human brain, we\r\nought not to be bewildered by the infinite variety of its sympathetic\r\nimpulses, inasmuch as it unerringly proves the true philosophy\r\nthat the mass-chords of such structures are governed by vibratory\r\netheric flows. There is no structure whatever--animal, vegetable,\r\nor mineral--that is not built up from the cosmic ether. Certain\r\norders of attractive vibration produce certain orders of structure;\r\nthus the infinite variety of effects; more especially in the cerebral\r\norgans. Discordance cannot exist in the molecule proper. Discordance in\r\nany mass is the result of differentiated groups induced by antagonistic\r\nchords, and any differentiated mass can be brought to a condition of\r\nharmony or equation by proper chord media, and an equated sympathy\r\nproduced whether the mass be metal or brain.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason for believing that insanity is simply a condition\r\nof differentiation in the mass-chords of the convolutions, which\r\ncreates an antagonistic molecular bombardment towards the neutral\r\nor attractive centres of such convolutions. This may be compared\r\nto a knot on a violin string. As long as this knot remains, it is\r\nimpossible to elicit, from its sympathetic surroundings, the condition\r\nwhich transfers pure concordance to its resonating body. Discordant\r\nconditions (i.e., differentiation of mass) produce negatization to\r\ncoincident action. Pure sympathetic concordants are as antagonistic to\r\nnegative discordants as the negative is to the positive; but the vast\r\nvolume the sympathetic holds over the non-sympathetic, in ethereal\r\nspace, makes it at once the ruling medium and re-adjuster of all\r\nopposing conditions, when properly brought to bear upon them....\r\n\r\nJosiah Royce is right as regards correspondent sympathetic association\r\nbetween two conditions. If concordance can be established, even of\r\nunlike states, no matter whether it be of the high tenuous forces\r\nof nature, gases with liquids, liquids with solids, solids with\r\ngases, the structural conditions can be perfectly adverse. Their\r\nneutral centres are the focalized seat of sympathetic concordance\r\nfor controlling any differentiation that may exist outside, or\r\nin the mass that surrounds them. Certain orders of vibration can\r\nreach these centres and establish a concordant flow of sympathy,\r\nindependent of any and all mass antagonism; in other words, certain\r\norders of sympathetic vibratory transmission can correct and equate\r\nall differentiation that may exist between physical organisms and\r\ntheir cerebellic flows. Discord is disease. Harmony is health.--Keely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Standard calls attention to the fact that Lord Rosebery has pointed\r\nout how fast mental disease of one form or another is growing among\r\nthe population of London--so fast that a new asylum, containing 5000\r\npatients, must be built every five years. \"This,\" said his lordship,\r\n\"is a penalty of civilization.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we take into consideration the effect upon the nerves, in\r\nsensitive organizations, of living in the vicinity of railways, more\r\nespecially of the elevated railways in cities, the incessant jarring\r\nvibrations which are communicated to houses, even from underground\r\nrailways, to say nothing of the piercing shrieks of the steam whistle,\r\nis it to be wondered at that mental disorders and nervous diseases\r\nare on the increase? With this increase of the most terrible form of\r\naffliction, the remedy will follow; for our necessities are known to\r\nOne who \"with a Father's care and affectionate attention supplies\r\nthe wants, as they arise, of the worlds which lie like children in\r\nHis bosom.\" Sympathetic Vibratory Physics will, in due time, make\r\nknown the curableness of many disorders now considered incurable.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Mr. Keely writes:--Every disease that the physical\r\norganism is subject to has its connective link in the cerebral\r\ndomain; where it unerringly telegraphs, as it were, its molecular\r\ndifferentiations, through the spinal dura mater or physical sympathetic\r\ntransmitter, and vice versâ back again. The sympathetic communication,\r\nas between the physical and mental forces, shows up truthfully the pure\r\nconditions that govern the celestial and terrestrial link of sympathy,\r\nas between the finite and the Infinite in planetary suspension. The\r\nwhole system governing the suspension of the innumerable planetary\r\nmasses,--the infinite certainty and harmony of their eccentric and\r\nconcentric evolutions and revolutions, in their orbital and oscillating\r\nranges of motion,--the triune sympathetic streams of Infinity that\r\npermeate their molecular masses--focalizing and defocalizing on\r\ntheir neutral centres of attraction--are all subservient to that\r\nGreat Ruling Power: Mind-Flow. There is not a grain of sand, nor an\r\ninvisible corpuscule of floating matter, that does not come under\r\nthe same rule that governs the most mighty of planets....\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"All's love, yet all's law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the offspring of God, only by living in love and harmony can we\r\nfulfil the law and maintain health and happiness, either individually\r\nin family life, or collectively in our intercourse with the world. As\r\nGoethe taught:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Let the God within thee speak,\r\n    Love all things that lovely be,\r\n    And God will show His best to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY.--KEELY THE FOUNDER OF A SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n            \"Were half the power that fills the world with terror,\r\n              Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts,\r\n            Given to redeem the human mind from error,\r\n              There were no need of arsenals and forts.\"\r\n\r\n        As long as men remain \"demons of selfishness and ignorance,\"\r\n        so long will they fight for their turn to tyrannize over\r\n        their brother men. Instruction and education can alone prepare\r\n        the way for a peaceful solution of the greatest problem that\r\n        mankind has ever had to deal with; for, before we can hope\r\n        to enter into a 'brotherhood of humanity,' the earth must be\r\n        'filled with the knowledge of the Lord.'--H.

Such then\r\n        is the two-fold problem which our age is called upon to\r\n        solve.--Frederich von Schlegel.\r\n\r\n        I come soon and will renew all things.--Scripture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederich von Schlegel, in his Lecture \"On the General Spirit of the\r\nAge,\" (1846) says, There are in the history of the eighteenth century,\r\nmany phenomena which occurred so suddenly, so instantaneously, that\r\nalthough on deeper consideration we may discover their efficient\r\ncauses in the past, in the natural state of things, and in the general\r\nsituation of the world, yet are there many circumstances which prove\r\nthat there was a deliberate, though secret, preparation of events, as,\r\nindeed, in many instances has been actually demonstrated. In tracing\r\nthe origin of this \"secret and mysterious branch of illuminism,\" and\r\nits influence in regard to the true restoration of society founded\r\non the basis of Christian justice, Schlegel gives it as his opinion\r\nthat the order of Templars was the channel by which this esoteric\r\ninfluence was introduced into the West, handing down the Solomonian\r\ntraditions connected with the very foundation of this order, and the\r\nreligious masonic symbols which admit of a Christian interpretation:\r\nbut, as he says, the idea of an esoteric society for the propagation\r\nof any secret doctrine is not compatible with the very principle of\r\nChristianity itself; for Christianity is a divine mystery which lies\r\nopen to all.\r\n\r\nContinuing from Schlegel's writings, the Christian faith has the living\r\nGod and His revelation for its object, and is itself that revelation;\r\nhence every doctrine taken from this source is something real and\r\npositive, while, in science, the absolute is the idol of vain and\r\nempty systems, of dead and abstract reason. In the absolute spirit\r\nof our age, and in the absolute character of its factions, there\r\nis a deep-rooted intellectual pride, which is not so much personal\r\nor individual as social, for it refers to the historical destiny of\r\nmankind and of this age in particular. Actuated by this pride, a spirit\r\nexalted by moral energy, or invested with external power, fancies it\r\ncan give a real existence to that which can only be the work of God;\r\nas from Him alone proceed all those mighty and real regenerations\r\nof the world, among which Christianity--a revolution in the high and\r\ndivine sense of the word--occupies the first place. For the last three\r\nhundred years this human pride has been at work; a pride that wishes\r\nto originate events, instead of humbly awaiting them and of resting\r\ncontented with the place assigned to it among those events.... It was\r\nindeed but a very small portion of this illuminism of the eighteenth\r\ncentury that was really derived from the truths of Christianity and\r\nthe pure light of Revelation. The rest was the mere work of man,\r\nconsequently vain and empty; or at least defective, corrupt in parts,\r\nand on the whole destitute of a solid foundation;--therefore devoid\r\nof all permanent strength and duration. But when once, after the\r\ncomplete victory of truth, the divine Reformation shall appear,\r\nthat human Reformation which till now has existed will sink to the\r\nground and disappear from the world. Then, by the universal triumph\r\nof Christianity, and the thorough religious regeneration of the age,\r\nof the world, and of governments themselves, will dawn the era of a\r\ntrue Christian Illuminism. This period is not perhaps so remote from\r\nour own as the natural indolence of the human mind would be disposed\r\nto believe, says Schlegel.\r\n\r\nNever was there a period that pointed so strongly, so clearly, so\r\ngenerally towards the future, as our own. In order to comprehend in\r\nall its magnitude the problem of our age, the birth of Christianity\r\nmust be the great point of survey to which we must recur; in order\r\nto examine clearly what has remained incomplete, what has not yet\r\nbeen attained. For, unquestionably, all that has been neglected,\r\nin the earlier periods and stages of Christian civilization, must be\r\nmade good in this true, consummate regeneration of society. If truth\r\nis to obtain a complete victory--if Christianity is really to triumph\r\non the earth, then must the state become Christian and science become\r\nChristian. Such then is the two-fold problem which our age is called\r\nupon to solve. Whatever man may contribute towards the religious\r\nregeneration of government and science, Schlegel reasons that we must\r\nlook for the consummation, in silent awe, to a higher Providence,\r\nto the creative fiat of a last period of dispensation, to \"the dawn\r\nof an approaching era of love and harmony,\" which will emancipate\r\nthe human race from the bondage in which it has been held by false\r\nteachings; leading men and nations to consider and estimate time,\r\nand all things temporal, not by the law and feeling of eternity:--but\r\nfor temporal interests, or from temporal motives; forgetting the\r\nthoughts and faith of eternity. All progress in the great work of\r\nthe religious regeneration of science Schlegel hails as the noblest\r\ntriumph of genius; for it is, he says, precisely in the department of\r\nphysics that the problem is the most difficult; and all that rich and\r\nboundless treasure of new discoveries in nature, which are ever better\r\nunderstood when viewed in connection with the high truths of religion,\r\nmust be looked upon as the property of Christian science. Our various\r\nsystems of philosophic Rationalism, he foretells, will fall to the\r\nground: and vulgar Rationalism, which is but an emanation of the\r\nhigher, will finally disappear. Then science will become thoroughly\r\nChristian. In the progress of mankind now, as in the past, a divine\r\nhand and conducting Providence are clearly discernible. Earthly\r\nand visible power has not alone co-operated in this progress;--that\r\nthe struggle has been, in part, carried on under divine, and against\r\ninvisible might, has been substantiated by Schlegel on firm and solid\r\ngrounds, if not proved to mathematical evidence; which evidence, as he\r\nremarks, is neither appropriate nor applicable to the subject. Schlegel\r\nconcludes his work on The Philosophy of History, by a retrospective\r\nview of society, considered in reference to that invisible world and\r\nhigher region, from which a pure philosophy teaches us the operations\r\nof this visible world proceed; in which its great destinies have their\r\nroot, and which is the ultimate and highest term of all its movements.\r\n\r\nBoth Schlegel and Keely teach that we shall prize with deeper, more\r\nearnest and more solid affection the great and divine era of man's\r\nredemption and emancipation, by Christianity, the more accurately\r\nwe discriminate between what is essentially divine and unchangeably\r\neternal in this revelation of love, and those elements of destruction\r\nwhich false teachings have opposed thereto or intermingled therewith;\r\ntracing in the special dispensations of Providence, for the advancement\r\nof Christianity and the progress of civilization and regeneration,\r\nthe wonderful concurrence of events towards the single object of divine\r\nlove, or the unexpected exercise of divine justice long delayed.

Stokes Bart., M.P., reasoning on the difficulties as to\r\ngood arising out of evil, says, \"In our study of nature we are most\r\nforcibly impressed with the uniformity of her laws. Those uniform\r\nlaws are, so far as we can judge, the method by which the ordinary\r\ncourse of nature is carried on. That is to say, if we recognize the\r\nordinary course of nature as designed by a Supreme Being, that it is\r\naccording to His will that the course of Nature should, as a rule,\r\nbe carried on in this regular methodical manner, we should expect,\r\ntherefore, to find the operation of regular laws in the moral, no\r\nless than in the physical world, although their existence is less\r\nobvious on account of the freedom of the will....\r\n\r\nThere is a conflict of opinion and a restlessness of men's minds\r\nat the present day; but we may confidently hope that if men will\r\nin a straightforward manner seek after what is true, and that in a\r\nhumble spirit, without arrogating to themselves the monopoly of truth\r\nand contemning others whose opinions may be different, the present\r\nconflict of opinion will in time settle down....\r\n\r\nIt is in this frame of mind that searchers after truth are now\r\nexamining the claims of Keely as a discoverer, and as the founder\r\nof a new and pure philosophy. If the most important subject and the\r\nfirst problem of philosophy is, as Schlegel declares, the restoration\r\nin man of the lost image of God, so far as this relates to science,\r\nall revolution, as well as all revelation, must tend toward the full\r\nunderstanding of this restoration in the internal consciousness,\r\nand not until it is really brought about will the object of pure\r\nphilosophy be fully attained.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of history shows clearly how, in the first ages of\r\nthe world, the original word of Divine revelation formed the firm\r\ncentral point of faith for the future reunion of the dispersed race\r\nof man; how later, amidst the various powers intellectual as well\r\nas political which (in the middle period of the world) all ruling\r\nnations exerted on their times, according to the measure allotted\r\nto them, it was alone the power of eternal love in the Christian\r\nreligion which truly emancipated and redeemed mankind; and how the\r\npure light of this Divine truth, universally diffused through the\r\nworld and through all science, will crown in conclusion the progress\r\nof this restoration in the future.\r\n\r\nThe fulfilment of the term of all Christian hope and Divine promise is\r\nreserved for the last period of consummation--for the new dispensation\r\nwhich the closing century is ushering in. The esoteric meaning of the\r\nsecond coming of our Lord is thus intimated to those who are watching\r\nfor the triumph of justice and truth. \"Behold I come quickly; and my\r\nreward is with me, to give every man according to his work.\"\r\n\r\nTheosophy interprets the often-quoted Scripture passage of \"the\r\nseven Spirits which are before His throne\" as the cosmical, creative,\r\nsustaining, and world-governing potencies, the principles of which\r\nGod avails Himself as His instruments, organs, and media. This is\r\nwhat the Kabbala implies with its seven \"Sephiroth,\" what Schelling\r\nmeans by the \"potencies,\" or principles in the inner life of God;\r\nand it is by their emergence, separation, and tension that they become\r\ncosmical potencies. If we stop short at these general considerations,\r\nthis is precisely the idea of Theosophy. When it is asked what special\r\nactivities are to be ascribed to each of the seven Spirits, striving\r\nto apprehend more closely the uncreated potencies through which the\r\nDeity works in its manifestation, and to which Scripture itself makes\r\nunmistakable allusion, revelation is silent, intimating only by veiled\r\nsuggestions. It is here that Theosophy leads the way to the open book\r\nof Nature: the title-page of which we have only begun to turn.\r\n\r\nTheosophy, says Bishop Martensen, signifies wisdom in God: \"Church\r\nTheology is not wise in assuming a hostile attitude towards Theosophy,\r\nbecause it hereby deprives itself of a most valuable leavening\r\ninfluence, a source of renewal and rejuvenescence, which Theology so\r\ngreatly needs, exposed as it is to the danger of stagnating in barren\r\nand dreary scholasticism and cold and trivial criticism. In such a\r\ncourse no real progress can be made in the Christian apprehension\r\nof truth.\" Jacob Böhme, who was the greatest and most famous of\r\nall Theosophists in the world, [16] said of philosophers and other\r\ndisputants who attack not only Theosophy but also theology, and even\r\nChristianity itself, in the name of modern science:--\"Every spirit\r\nsees no further than its mother, out of which it has its original,\r\nand wherein it stands; for it is impossible for any spirit, in its\r\nown natural power to look into another principle, and behold it,\r\nexcept it be regenerated therein.\" This is what Christ taught: \"Ye\r\nmust be born again.\" Only those who are regenerated, by the principle\r\nof which Christ spoke to Nicodemus, can understand the quickening of\r\nthe Spirit which comes alone from Him who gives this new birth to all\r\nwho seek it, and in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge\r\nare hidden:--\"hidden, not in order that they may remain secret,\r\nbut in order that they may ever increasingly be made manifest and\r\nappropriated by us.\"\r\n\r\nJacob Böhme, who was born in 1575, \"brought to the birth\" an idea\r\nwhich, three centuries later, is developing into a system of pure\r\nphilosophy, that promises to \"cover the earth with wisdom and\r\nunderstanding in the deep mysteries of God.\"\r\n\r\nBöhme gave birth to an idea. Keely is giving birth to a system. Both\r\nare exceedingly imperfect in the expression of their views; yet in\r\npoints of detail each possesses a firm dialectical grip. In their\r\nwritings both seem overwhelmed by the vast extent of the realm they\r\nare exploring. Both find in harmony the object and the ending of\r\nthe world's development. Conflicting with modern science at very\r\nmany points, visionary as both appear to be, powerful expression is\r\ngiven to an idea of life both in the macrocosm and the microcosm,\r\nthe validity of which can be questioned only by materialism. The\r\nidea of the one and the system of the other teach that when Nature\r\nis affirmed in God it is in a figurative and symbolical sense:--that\r\nit is, in comparison with what we call nature, something infinitely\r\nmore subtle and super-material than matter; that it is the source of\r\nmatter; a plenitude of living forces and energies. This system teaches,\r\nas \"Waterdale\" has expressed it, \"the existence of a Great Almighty,\r\nas being in virtue of the perfect organization of the universe, even\r\nas the existence of man is incidental to the organic structure of his\r\nbody;\" and that the attribute of omniscience is represented by \"the\r\nperfect conveyance of signs of atomic movement in vibratory action\r\nthrough the length and breadth of our universe.\" We are led by it to\r\nlook from nature up to nature's God and to comprehend the attributes\r\nof deity as never before in any other system. It lays hold, with a\r\ngiant's grasp, of the heart of the problems which science is wrestling\r\nwith. It answers the question asked by Professor Oliver Lodge in his\r\npaper, read at Cardiff, last August, \"By what means is force exerted,\r\nand what definitely is force?\" It was a bold speculation of Professor\r\nLodge, who is known as \"a very careful and sober physicist,\" when,\r\nafter admitting that there is herein something not provided for in\r\nthe orthodox scheme of physics, he suggested that good physicists\r\nshould carry their appropriate methods of investigation into the\r\nfield of psychology, admitting that a line of possible advance lies\r\nin this direction. Without speculation science could never advance in\r\nany direction; discussion precedes reform, there can be no progress\r\nwithout it. It required rare courage for a physicist to step from the\r\nserried ranks that have always been ready to point their javelins at\r\npsychologists, and to show, with the torch of science, the hand on the\r\nsignpost at the cross roads pointing in the right direction. It is the\r\ngreat high road of knowledge; but those who would explore it must do\r\nso with cautious tread, until the system of sympathetic association is\r\ncompleted which Keely is bringing to birth, for the road is bordered\r\nwith pitfalls and quicksands and the mists of ignorance envelop it.\r\n\r\nErnest Renan, in \"The Future of Science,\" illustrates the thesis\r\nthat, henceforth, the advancement of civilization is to be the work\r\nof science; the word science being used in its largest signification\r\nas covering intellectual achievement in every direction open to the\r\nmind, and the co-ordination of the results in a progressive philosophy\r\nof life. The fundamental distinction which is expressed or implied,\r\non every page, is that the earlier processes of civilization belong\r\nto an age of spontaneity, of unreflective productivity; an age that\r\nexpressed itself in myths, created religions, organized social forms\r\nand habits, in harmony with the spontaneous creations; and that we\r\nhave now entered upon the critical, defining, intellectual age; in\r\nshort, as Mr. Nisbet has said, that the evolution of the human race\r\nhas passed from the physiological into the psychical field; and that\r\nit is in the latter alone, henceforward, that progress may be looked\r\nfor toward a higher civilization. [17] Philosophy, that is to say,\r\nrational research, is alone capable of solving the question of the\r\nfuture of humanity, says Renan. \"The really efficacious revolution,\r\nthat which will give its shape to the future, will not be a political,\r\nit will be a religious and moral revolution. Politics has exhausted its\r\nresources for solving this problem. The politician is the offscouring\r\nof humanity, not its inspired teacher. The great revolution can only\r\ncome from men of thought and sentiment. It does not do to expect too\r\nmuch from governments. It is not for them to reveal to humanity the\r\nlaw for which it is in search. What humanity needs is a moral law and\r\ncreed; and it is from the depths of human nature that they will emerge,\r\nand not from the well-trodden and sterile pathways of the official\r\nworld.\" In order to know whence will come a better understanding of\r\nthe religion which Christ taught, \"the religion of the future, we must\r\nalways look in the direction of liberty, equality, and fraternity.\" Not\r\nthe French Commune liberty to cut one another's throats (an equality\r\nof misery, and a fraternity of crime), but that liberty to know and to\r\nlove the truth of things which constitutes true religion, and which\r\nwhen it is bestowed without money and without price, as it will be,\r\n\"humanity will accomplish the remainder, without asking anyone for\r\npermission.\" No one can say from what part of the sky will appear\r\nthe star of this new redemption. The one thing certain is that the\r\nshepherds and the Magi will be once more the first to perceive it, that\r\nthe germ of it is already formed, and that if we were able to see the\r\npresent with the eyes of the future, we should be able to distinguish,\r\nin the complication of the hour, the imperceptible fibre which will\r\nbear life for the future. It is amid putrefaction that the germ of\r\nfuture life is developed, and no one has the right to say, \"This is a\r\nrejected stone,\" for that stone may be the corner-stone of the future\r\nedifice. Human nature is without reproach, continues Renan (L'Avenir\r\nde la Science), and proceeds toward the perfect by means of forms\r\nsuccessively and diversely imperfect. All the ideas which primitive\r\nscience had formed of the world appear narrow, trivial, and ridiculous\r\nto us after that which progressive research has proven to be true. The\r\nfact is that science has only destroyed her dreams of the past, to put\r\nin their stead a reality a thousand times superior; but were science\r\nto remain what it is, we should have to submit to it while cursing\r\nit, for it has destroyed and not builded up again; it has awakened\r\nman from a sweet sleep without smoothing the reality to him. What\r\nscience gives us is not enough, we are still hungry. True science is\r\nthat which belongs neither to the school nor the drawing-room, but\r\nwhich corresponds exactly to the wants of man. Hence true science\r\nis a religion which will solve for men the eternal problems, the\r\nsolution of which his nature imperatively demands. Herein lies the\r\nhope of humanity; for, like a wild beast, the uneducated masses\r\nstand at bay; ready to turn and rend those who are willing to keep\r\nthem in their present condition, in order to be able to make them\r\nanswer their own purposes.... I am firmly convinced, continues Renan,\r\nfor my own part, that unless we make haste and elevate the people,\r\nwe are upon the eve of a terrible outbreak of barbarism. For if the\r\npeople triumph in their present state, it will be worse than it was\r\nwith the Franks and Vandals. They will destroy of their own accord\r\nthe instrument which might have served to elevate them; we shall then\r\nhave to wait until civilization once more emerges spontaneously from\r\nthe profound depths of nature. Morality, like politics, is summed up,\r\nthen, in this grand saying: To elevate the people. If I were to see\r\nhumanity collapse on its own foundations, mankind again slaughter\r\none another in some fateful hour, I should still go on proclaiming\r\nthat perfection is human nature's final aim, and that the day must\r\ncome when reason and perfection shall reign supreme.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Sailing, sailing in the same staunch ship--\r\n          We are sailing on together;\r\n        We see the rocks and we mark the shoals,\r\n          And we watch for cyclone weather.\r\n\r\n        The perils we run for one alone\r\n          Are perils for all together,--\r\n        The harbour we make for one alone,\r\n          Makes haven for all, through the weather.\r\n\r\n        Stand by your ship: be brave, brothers mine!\r\n          Be brave, for we'll stand together!\r\n        We'll yet reach the port for which we sail\r\n          In this black and stormy weather.\r\n\r\n        Sailing, sailing the same stormy sea,\r\n          We are sailing all together!\r\n        There are rocks ahead and shoals beneath,\r\n          And 'round us hurricane weather.\r\n\r\n        I see in the West a star arise,\r\n          That will guide us all together:--\r\n        Stand firm by your helm and trust in God\r\n          Who pilots us through this weather.\r\n\r\n        The dawn of morning breaks in the skies\r\n          Which will bring mankind together;--\r\n        To havens of peace, to havens of bliss,\r\n          We'll ride through this cyclone weather.\r\n\r\n                                        Clara Jessup Moore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nAN APPEAL IN BEHALF OF THE CONTINUANCE OF KEELY'S RESEARCHES.\r\n\r\n        There is a distinct advantage in having one section\r\n        of scientific men beginning their work untrammelled by\r\n        preconceived notions.--Engineering.\r\n\r\n        A knowledge of scientific theories seems to kill all knowledge\r\n        of scientific facts.--Professor Schuster.\r\n\r\n        Tizeau found that the speed of light is increased in water\r\n        which moves in the same direction as the light. This result\r\n        must be due either to the motion of matter through the medium,\r\n        or to the fact that moving matter carries the ether with\r\n        it. The whole question of matter and motion as a medium is\r\n        a vital one, and we shall hardly make any serious advance\r\n        before experiment has found a new opening.--Professor Schuster.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Keely, in 1891, was Able To Secure the Attention Of Men of\r\nScience To His Researching Experiments.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1890, Mr. Keely was harassed by threats, said to\r\nproceed from disappointed stockholders in the Keely Motor Company,\r\nof suits at law for \"obtaining money under false pretences.\" After\r\nmaking many unsuccessful attempts with the editors of leading\r\nmagazines in London, Boston, and New York, to bring before the\r\npublic the claims of Mr. Keely for sympathy in his colossal work,\r\nthe proposals of an editor, on the staff of the London Times (who\r\nhad the year before introduced himself to Mrs. Bloomfield Moore to\r\nobtain information of Keely) to make known the researches of the\r\npersecuted discoverer and his need of assistance, at that time, were\r\naccepted. The programme, as laid out by this editor, was to use his\r\nextended influence with the leading journals throughout Great Britain,\r\nand to have brief notices of Keely inserted; to be followed up with\r\na magazine article, for which the material was furnished. Later this\r\narrangement was modified by the editor, who then proposed to write an\r\nessay for some influential journal, handling the various molecular and\r\natomic theories; pointing out wherein Keely's views were original,\r\nand showing their revolutionizing tendencies. This work, which was\r\nto have been commenced in November, was delayed until all need was\r\nover. When the editor wrote to Philadelphia in January, 1891, that he\r\nhad been unable to commence his work for want of sufficient material\r\n(enclosing questions to be answered by Mr. Keely before he could set\r\nabout it), the answer returned was that the threatened troubles were\r\nover, that Mr. Keely had gained the protection of men of science,\r\nand the order for the essay was countermanded. At this very time\r\na subscription was in circulation to raise money from disaffected\r\nstockholders for the purpose of bringing the threatened action at\r\nlaw, in case Mr. Keely did not resume work on his engine, instead of\r\npursuing researches in order to gain more knowledge of the operation\r\nof this unknown polar force in nature.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that the late Professor Joseph Leidy, that\r\neminent man of science who had been the first to recognize the\r\nimportance of Keely's discovery to the scientific world, arranged\r\nwith the Provost of the University of Pennsylvania that an appeal\r\nshould be made to the trustees, the faculty and the professors of\r\nthat institution, to permit Keely to continue his researches for\r\nscience under their protection.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 14th of January, 1891, a paper entitled \"Keely's\r\nDiscoveries\" was read at the house of Provost Pepper. The answer sent\r\nby one of the professors, in reply to Dr. Pepper's invitation, probably\r\nexpressed the views held by all the distinguished men who assembled\r\nto listen to the appeal, which was to the effect that the professor\r\nwould be present to hear the paper read, if the Provost wished it;\r\nbut, if he came, he should make it very unpleasant for the reader,\r\nas he had no faith in Keely nor in his discoveries. All those who\r\nwere present listened with attention, and among the few who became\r\ninterested in the claims of Keely as a discoverer, was the professor\r\nwho had made this remark. The preamble to the appeal was read by the\r\nProvost, Dr. Pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreamble.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing to read my paper I wish to lay before you the object\r\nof this effort to interest men of science in the researches of a man\r\nwho, in the cause of justice alone, is entitled to have his life's\r\nwork fairly represented to you. Some of our men of science have,\r\nunwittingly, been the medium by which great injustice has been done\r\nto Mr. Keely; and to others also, by placing me before the world as a\r\nwoman whom the Keely Motor Company management has robbed of large sums\r\nof money; whereas, in truth, I have never been in any way involved\r\nby the Keely Motor Company.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1881-82, Mr. Keely, who was dependent upon \"The\r\nKeely Motor Company\" for the means to continue his researches, as\r\nto the nature of the unknown force he had discovered, was virtually\r\nabandoned by the Company. Himself as ignorant as were its managers\r\nof the source of the mysterious energy he had stumbled over, he\r\nwas driven to despair by their action; and, when I was led to his\r\nassistance, I found his wife's roof mortgaged over her head, and that,\r\nhis honour assailed, he had resolved to take his life rather than\r\nsubmit to the indignities threatening him. At this time I had taken\r\nfrom my private estate ten thousand dollars, to found a small public\r\nlibrary to my father's memory, in the town of Westfield, Hampden Co.,\r\nMassachusetts. After convincing myself that Mr. Keely had made a\r\ngreat discovery, I felt that if this money could save his discovery,\r\njeopardized as it was, it was my duty to so appropriate it. At that\r\ntime, Mr. Keely thought half of the amount so appropriated would be\r\nall that he should require; but, unfortunately, his efforts were for\r\nyears confined to the construction of an engine for the Company that\r\nhad abandoned him. Later, he commenced researches which resulted in\r\nthe discovery that he had unknowingly imprisoned the ether; greatly\r\nincreasing my interest in his work.\r\n\r\nThe plan to which I shall allude in my paper, as framed by Professor\r\nLeidy for Mr. Keely to follow, and approved by Professor Hertz, of\r\nBonn, and Professor Fitzgerald, of Trinity College, Dublin, may be\r\nsummed up as one that permits Mr. Keely to pursue his researches on\r\nhis own line, without further investigation, up to the completion\r\nof his system in a form which will enable him to give to commerce\r\nwith one hand his model for aerial navigation, and to science,\r\nwith the other, the knowledge that is necessary for extending its\r\nresearches in the field of radiant energy--which Mr. Keely has been\r\nexploring for so many years. I ask the prestige of your sympathy,\r\nas well as for your interest in Mr. Keely's work, on this basis;\r\nand if in one year you are not convinced that satisfactory results\r\nhave been attained for science, I will promise to leave Mr. Keely in\r\nthe hands of the \"usurers and Shylocks of commerce,\" who have already\r\nforced him into renouncing seven-eighths of his interest in what the\r\nKeely Motor Company claims as its property.\r\n\r\nAt present I do not desire from anyone endorsement of Keely's\r\ndiscoveries. Until his system is completed he wishes to avoid all\r\ndiscussion and all public mention of the anticipated value of his\r\ninventions. Mr. Keely's programme of experimental research, as laid\r\ndown by himself last March, when I first proposed to furnish him with\r\nall the funds needed to carry it out, comprises its continuance\r\nuntil he has gained sufficient knowledge of the energy he is\r\ncontrolling--which is derived from the disintegration of water--to\r\nenable him to impart to others a system that will permit men of\r\nscience to produce and to handle the energy, and enable him to\r\ninstruct artisans in the work which lies in their province; viz.,\r\nthe construction of machines to apply this costless motive power\r\nin mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe prestige of your interest in Mr. Keely's labours can alone\r\nsecure to him freedom to pursue researches on his own road; a\r\ncourse pronounced by Professor Leidy, Professor Hertz, and Professor\r\nFitzgerald, to be \"the only proper line for him to pursue.\"\r\n\r\nThe building of an engine is not in Mr. Keely's province. His\r\nresearches completed to that point which is necessary, for perfect\r\ncontrol of the force, practical application will follow. The result of\r\nhis experimental work for nine months on this line has been such as to\r\nrevive the interest of the speculative management of the Keely Motor\r\nCompany, to that extent that Mr. Keely is now offered the support\r\nof its stockholders if he will resume construction of an engine;\r\nand this after more than seven years of failure on the part of the\r\ncompany to furnish him with one dollar to carry on \"the enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nThe official Report put forth in January by the Keely Motor Company\r\nmanagers annulled my contract with Mr. Keely; but he is willing\r\nto abide by it, if I am able to continue to furnish him with the\r\nnecessary funds. This position of affairs has forced me to the front,\r\nto ask whether you will place it in my power to renew the contract\r\nwith Mr. Keely; or leave him under the control of men who seem to\r\nbe oblivious of the interests of the stockholders of the company in\r\ntheir \"clamour\" for an engine. When this system is completed, in its\r\napplication to mechanics, the present mode of running engines with\r\nshafts and beltings will disappear, creating a revolution in all\r\nbranches of industry.\r\n\r\nLooking at my request from another point of view, do you not think it\r\ndue to extend to Mr. Keely an opportunity to prove all that one of\r\nyour number is ready to announce as his conviction in regard to the\r\nclaims of Mr. Keely? You all know to whom I refer--Professor Joseph\r\nLeidy. \"Oh, Leidy is a biologist,\" said an English physicist not long\r\nsince; \"get the opinion of a physicist for us.\" If I did not wish\r\nfor the opinion of physicists, I should not have appealed to you for\r\nhelp at this most critical juncture. But I also ask that no opinion\r\nbe given by any physicist until Mr. Keely's theories are understood\r\nand demonstrated, by experiment. Yes, Dr. Leidy is a biologist, and\r\nwhat better preparation could a man have than a study of the science\r\nof life to enable him to discern between laws of nature as invented\r\nby physicists, and nature's operations as demonstrated by Keely?\r\n\r\nThe science of life has not been the only branch to which Dr. Leidy has\r\ngiven profound attention; it is his extensive and accurate knowledge\r\nof its methods, limits, and tendencies, which prepared the way for\r\nthat quick comprehension of possibilities, lying hidden from the sight\r\nof those men of science whose minds have rested (rusted?) in the dead\r\ngrooves of mechanical physics. In Dr. Leidy we find entire scientific\r\nand intellectual liberty of thought, with that love of justice and\r\ntruth which keeps its possessor from arrogance and intolerance, leading\r\nhim with humility to \"prove all things and hold fast to truth.\" To\r\nsuch men the world owes all that we have of advance since the days\r\nwhen science taught that the earth is flat, arguing that were it\r\nround the seas and oceans would fall off into space. In Dr. Leidy's\r\nname and in justice to him, I ask your sanction to and approval of\r\nmy efforts to preserve Keely's discoveries for science;--discoveries\r\nwhich explain, not only the causes of the planetary motions but the\r\nsource of the one eternal and universal force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Appeal in Behalf of Science.\r\n\r\nA paper read by Mrs. Bloomfield Moore at the house of Provost Pepper\r\non the evening of January 14th, 1891, before members of the board of\r\ntrustees and professors of the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Each day he wrought, and better than he planned,\r\n        Shape breeding shape beneath his restless hand;\r\n        The soul without still helps the soul within,\r\n        And its deft magic ends what we begin.\r\n\r\n                                                George Eliot.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope that I do not seem to be too presumptuous in my effort to\r\nawaken an interest, on your part, in the discoveries of Keely which\r\nhave aroused a marked degree of attention among some of the most\r\nlearned men in Europe.\r\n\r\nI should hardly have ventured to ask the prestige of your support to\r\nbe given to Mr. Keely, in his further scientific researches, were it\r\nnot that one of your number fully realizes, I think, the important\r\nnature of these researches. You all know to whom I refer--Professor\r\nJoseph Leidy. In his book, \"Fresh Water Rhizopods of North America,\"\r\nhe says, in his concluding remarks: \"I may perhaps continue in the same\r\nfield of research and give to the reader further results, but I cannot\r\npromise to do so, for though the subject has proved to me an unceasing\r\nsource of pleasure I see before me so many wonderful things in other\r\nfields, that a strong impulse disposes me to leap the hedges to examine\r\nthem.\" I have reason to know that, had Dr. Leidy not followed this\r\nimpulse, our age might have been robbed of its birthright.\r\n\r\nIt was not until I appealed to Professor Leidy and Dr. Willcox, to\r\nconvince themselves whether I was right or wrong in extending aid to\r\nMr. Keely, that their decision enabled me to continue to assist him\r\nuntil he has once more made such advances, in experimental research,\r\nas to cause the managers of the Keely Motor Company to believe that\r\nhis engine is near completion, and that they can dispense with outside\r\nassistance hereafter.\r\n\r\nBut I know as it has been in the past so will it be again, and that,\r\nas the months glide away, if no engine is completed, the company will\r\nonce more desert the discoverer; while, if he is allowed to pursue his\r\nresearches, up to the completion of his system under your protection,\r\nhis discoveries will be guarded for science, and the interests of\r\nthe stockholders will not be sacrificed to the greed of speculators,\r\nas has so often been done in the past.\r\n\r\nAs I have had occasion to say, elsewhere, after the warning given\r\nin the history of Huxley's Bathybius, Professor Leidy would not have\r\nrisked his world-wide reputation by the endorsement of Keely's claims,\r\nas the discoverer of hidden energy in inter-molecular and atomic\r\nspaces, had he not tested the demonstrations until fully convinced of\r\nthe discovery of a force previously unknown to science, and of the\r\nhonesty of Mr. Keely in his explanations. Therefore, following the\r\nadvice of Professor G. Fr. Fitzgerald, of Dublin, I do not ask for\r\nfurther investigations. Until Professor Leidy and Dr. Willcox came to\r\nthe front, in May, 1891, Mr. Keely had no influential supporters, and\r\nwas under such a cloud, from his connection with speculators, that to\r\nadvocate his integrity of purpose and to uphold the importance of his\r\nwork, was enough to awaken doubts as to the sanity of his upholders.\r\n\r\nWe are told by Herodotus that science is to know things truly; yet\r\npast experience shows us that what has been called knowledge at one\r\nperiod of time is proved to be but folly in another age. Science is\r\nto know things truly, and the laws of nature are the same yesterday,\r\nto-day, and forever. Throughout the universe the same laws are at work\r\nand regulate all things. Men interpret these laws to suit their own\r\nideas. The system which Keely is unfolding shows us that there is not\r\none grain of sand, nor one invisible corpuscule of floating matter,\r\nthat does not come under the same law that governs the most mighty\r\nplanet, and that all forms of matter are aggregated under one law. \"The\r\ndesigns of the Creator as expounded by our latest teachers,\" writes\r\nGilman, \"have required millions of ages to carry out. They are so vast\r\nand complex that they can only be realized in the sweep of ages. One\r\ndesign is subordinated by another without ever being lost sight of,\r\nuntil the time has arrived for its complete fulfilment. These designs\r\ninvolve an infinitude of effort, ending often in what, to our view,\r\nlooks like failure, to be crowned after a series of ages with complete\r\nsuccess at last.\"\r\n\r\nIn this long chain of physical causes, says Dr. Willcox, seemingly\r\nendless, but really commencing with that one link that touches the\r\nhand of Him who made all matter, and all potencies that dwell within\r\nmatter, this cosmical activity has been ceaseless, these cosmical\r\neffects numerous past conception, by which universal nature has slowly\r\nunfolded and become the universe of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn this way both Christianity and science unfold their truths\r\nprogressively. Truth, like the laws of nature, never changes; yet truth\r\nas an absolute thing, existing in and by itself, is relatively capable\r\nof change; for as the atoms hold in their tenacious grasp undreamed-of\r\npotencies, so truths hold germs potential of all growth. Each new\r\ntruth disclosed to the world, when its hour of need comes, unfolds and\r\nreveals undreamed-of means of growth. As the Rev. George Boardman has\r\nsaid of Christianity, so may it be said of science: Being a perennial\r\nvine, it is ever yielding new wine.\r\n\r\nA philosopher has said that if ever a human being needed divine\r\npity it is the pseudo-scientist who believes in nothing but what he\r\ncan prove by his own methods. In the light of Keely's discoveries,\r\nscience will have to admit that when she concentrates her attention\r\nupon matter, to the exclusion of mind, she is as the hunter who has\r\nno string in reserve for his bow. When she recognizes that a full\r\nand adequate science of matter is impossible to man, and that the\r\nscience of mind is destined ultimately to attain to a much higher\r\ndegree of perfection than the science of matter--that it will give\r\nthe typical ideas and laws to which all the laws of physics must be\r\nreferred--then science will be better supplied with strings than she\r\nnow is, to bring her quarry down.\r\n\r\nIt is Professor Leidy's and Dr. Willcox's second strings, to their\r\nbows, which will enable you to secure to science the richest quarry\r\nthat has ever been within its reach. I know that the experience of\r\nProfessor Rowland, as related by him, must have had the effect to\r\nprejudice you against Mr. Keely. Professor Fitzgerald writes to me on\r\nthis subject: \"I am sorry that Mr. Keely did not cut the wire, wherever\r\nProfessor Rowland asked to have it cut, because it will undoubtedly be\r\nsaid that he had some sinister reason for not doing so, whatever his\r\nreal reasons were; but, of course, when one cuts a bit off a valuable\r\nstring one prefers naturally to cut the bit off the end, as Keely did,\r\nrather than out of the middle.\" This very wire which Mr. Keely did cut\r\nat one end, twice, for Professor Rowland, one of the pieces falling\r\ninto my hand, is now in Professor Fitzgerald's possession. It was\r\nthe offensive manner of Professor Rowland when he seized the shears,\r\ntelling Keely it was his guilty conscience which made him refuse to cut\r\nthe wire, and that it must be cut in the middle, which put Keely on the\r\ndefensive, causing him to refuse to allow Professor Rowland to cut it.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the professor in the Johns Hopkins University,\r\nfrom his remarks on that occasion, thought, instead of an experiment\r\nin negative attraction, that Keely was imposing upon the ignorant\r\nby giving a simple experiment in pneumatics, familiar to all\r\nschoolboys. Professor Rowland did not realize how low he was rating the\r\npowers of discernment of a professor in the University of Pennsylvania\r\nwho had witnessed Keely's experiments again and again, when his\r\ninstruments or devices were in perfect working order. Mr. Keely,\r\nwho was ambitious to show Professor Rowland that his disintegrator\r\nhad no connection with any concealed apparatus, had suspended it\r\nfrom the ceiling by a staple. The hook had given way, and the jar\r\nto the instrument in falling to the floor disarranged its interior\r\nconstruction on that day. To those who have not witnessed any of\r\nKeely's experiments, under favourable conditions, his theories\r\nnaturally seem vague speculations; but not one theory has Keely\r\nput forward, as a theory, which he has not demonstrated as having a\r\nsolid foundation in fact. Some of our men of science once settled\r\nthe problem of the origin of life to their own satisfaction, only\r\nto learn in the end that speculation is not science; but this very\r\nproblem is one the solution of which Keely now seems to be approaching.\r\n\r\nIt would become a matter of easy analysis, writes Keely, if the\r\nproperties governing the different orders of matter could be understood\r\nin their different evolutions. The force of the mind on matter is an\r\nillustration of the power of the finer over the crude, but the law\r\nmaking the crude forms of matter subservient to the finer or higher\r\nforms, is an unknown law to finite minds.\r\n\r\nBuckle has asserted that the highest of our so called laws of\r\nnature are as yet purely empirical; and that, until some law is\r\ndiscovered which is connected with the laws of the mind that made it,\r\nour knowledge has no sure basis. So saturated has Mr. Keely's mind\r\nbeen with his discovery of this law that he has contented himself\r\nto remain ignorant in physics, as taught by the schools; and also\r\nwith simpler matters it would seem; while testing and building up\r\nhis hypotheses into a system which no one but himself can complete,\r\nand which without completion must be lost to the world. I should form\r\na very poor opinion of the mind that would accept an hypothesis as\r\nanything more than the signpost at cross roads, which points to the\r\ndirection that may be taken. In physics the very first fact to which\r\nthe learner is introduced is already sophisticated by hypotheses. Every\r\nexperiment in chemistry is but a member of a series, all based upon\r\nsome one or other of many hypotheses; which are as necessary to\r\nthe construction of a system as is the scaffolding which is used in\r\nbuilding an edifice. If the scaffolding proves unsound it does not\r\naffect the edifice, as it can be at once replaced with material more\r\nsolid. So an hypothesis, which is merely a conjecture or a suggestion,\r\ncannot affect the solidity of a philosophy or a system. It must be\r\ntested and found to support all the facts which bear upon it, and\r\ncapable of accounting for them, before it can be accepted as a theory.\r\n\r\nIt is my wish to have the professors of the University of Pennsylvania\r\nmeet at my house the founder of a system which, in my opinion, embraces\r\na pure philosophy: to listen to his theories, and to elicit from him\r\nsuch information as to the nature of his researches, in what is called\r\nelectro-magnetic radiation, as I trust will convince them that I have\r\nnot been pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp during the years that my mind\r\nhas been concentrated on the work in which Mr. Keely is engaged. The\r\nbearings of this work are so various that I shall not have time to\r\ntouch upon more than the one which interests me beyond any or all of\r\nthe others; namely, its connection with the medical art. Appreciating\r\nas I do the life of self-denial which physicians who are devoted to\r\ntheir profession must lead, and having in their ranks relatives and\r\nmany warm friends on both sides of the ocean (one of them, my nephew,\r\nDr. Jessup, is here to-night) I trust that what I say of the medical\r\nart will not be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nThe great sorrows of my life have come upon me through the ignorance of\r\nmedical men, who, I know, followed their best judgment in the course of\r\ntreatment that they pursued in the illnesses of those dear to me. When\r\nmy children were in their infancy I had reason to embrace the opinions\r\nof Professor Magendie, as set forth in one of his lectures before the\r\nstudents of his class in the Allopathic College of Paris. These are\r\nhis words: \"I know medicine is called a science. It is nothing like a\r\nscience. It is a great humbug. Doctors are mere empirics when they are\r\nnot charlatans. We are as ignorant as men can be. Who knows anything\r\nabout medicine? I do not, nor do I know anyone who does know anything\r\nabout it. Nature does a great deal; imagination does a great deal,\r\ndoctors do d----h little when they do no harm.\"\r\n\r\nLater in life, in 1871, I was sent, while suffering with neurasthenia,\r\nfrom Paris to Schwalbach Baths by Dr. Beylard, who recommended me to\r\nthe care of Dr. Adolph Genth; to whom, in my first interview, I said:\r\n\"I wish for your opinion, and for your advice, if you can give it to\r\nme without prescribing any medicine.\" He replied: \"With all my heart,\r\nMadam, and I wish to God there were more women like you; but we should\r\nsoon lose our patients, if we did not dose them.\" A terrible excuse for\r\nthe use of those agencies which Dr. John Good has said have sent more\r\nhuman beings to their graves than war, pestilence and famine combined.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Keely's discoveries shapes his theory that all nervous and\r\nbrain disorders may be cured by equating the differentiation that\r\nexists in the disordered structure. When his system is completed,\r\nmedical men will have a new domain opened to them for experiment. Gross\r\nmaterial agencies, such as drugs, will be replaced by the finer forces\r\nof nature: light, as taught by the late Dr. Pancoast of our city, and\r\nmagnetism, as experimented with by the late Professor Keil of Jena,\r\nshowing the efficacy of the ordinary magnet in the cure of certain\r\ninfirmities,--these experiments were communicated by him more than\r\nfifty years since to the Royal Society of London.\r\n\r\nParacelsus taught that man is nourished and sustained by magnetic\r\npower, which he called the universal motor of nature. In Switzerland,\r\nin Italy and in France, the light-treatment is now being tested;\r\nred light used in cases of melancholia; blue light in cases of great\r\nnervous excitement, operating like magic in some instances. Dr. Oscar\r\nJennings, the electrician at St. Anne's Hospital for the Insane\r\nin Paris, tells me that students, versed in Biblical lore, declare\r\nthat the esoteric teachings of the Book of Job enunciate a system\r\nof light-cure. Ostensibly because of my faith in the importance of\r\nKeely's discoveries, as opening up new fields of research to medical\r\nmen, an invalid daughter (suffering from puerperal mania after the\r\nbirth of her third child) was taken from me, in conformance with\r\norders of the Swedish guardian of her monied interests in Sweden, and\r\nI was summoned before the Police Direction, in Vienna, and required to\r\nbind myself not to experiment upon my child. It is well known to the\r\nLondon experts in mental disorders, the most distinguished of whom\r\nI have consulted, that my daughter's treatment, while she was under\r\nmy care, had been confined to giving no medicine, forcing no food,\r\nand such changes from time to time in her surroundings as she needed,\r\nwith a few electric baths.\r\n\r\nThe orthodox practice of medicine is nothing more and nothing less than\r\n\"a system of blind experiment,\" as it has been called.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of a clinical society in London, Sir Thomas Watson said:\r\n\"We try this and not succeeding we try that, and baffled again we try\r\nsomething else.\" Other eminent medical men have given utterance to\r\nthese aphorisms: \"The science of medicine is founded on conjecture\r\nand improved by murder;\" \"Mercury has made more cripples than war;\"\r\n\"Ninety-nine medical facts are medical lies;\" \"Every dose of medicine\r\nis a blind experiment;\" \"The older physicians grow the more sceptical\r\nthey become of the virtues of their own medicines.\" Dr. Ridge said:\r\n\"Everything in nature is acknowledged to be governed by law. It is\r\nsingular, however, that while science endeavours to reduce this to\r\nactual fact in all other studies, those of health and disease have\r\nnot hitherto been arranged under any law whatever.\"\r\n\r\nKeely's system, should he live to complete it, will show that\r\nnature works under one law in everything; that discord is disease,\r\nthat harmony is health. He believes that nervous and brain disorders\r\nare curable; but he will never have the leisure to enter this field\r\nof research himself, and it will be left for physicians to pursue\r\ntheir experiments to that point where they shall be able to decide\r\nwhether he is right or wrong. This is why I seek to interest medical\r\nmen in Keely's belief; his theories of latent energy he is able to\r\nhandle without help, and to demonstrate a solid foundation for them on\r\nfacts. \"Nothing can lie like a fact,\" said Velpeau. But nature's laws\r\nare infallible facts, and the facts referred to by Velpeau are of the\r\norder of the fallible ones enunciated by science, such as \"The atom is\r\nindivisible.\" \"The atom is infinitely divisible,\" says Keely, repeating\r\nSchopenhauer's words, whose writings I dare say he has never read.\r\n\r\nProfessor George Fr. Fitzgerald, of Trinity College, Dublin, in closing\r\na lecture delivered before the British Association last March, on\r\n\"Electro-magnetic Radiation,\" enunciates a possible theory of ether and\r\nmatter. This hypothesis, he says, explains the differences in nature\r\nas differences of motion. If it be true, ether and matter--gold, air,\r\nwood, brains--are but different motions. You will be able to judge of\r\nthe marvellous mechanism invented by Keely, for his researches, when I\r\ntell you that by his demonstrations with these instruments, he is able\r\nto place this hypothesis in the rank of theories, boldly announcing\r\nthat all motion is thought, and that all force is mind force. With a\r\nclearness that characterizes his great brain he has plunged through the\r\ndeep and broad questions surrounding the mechanism of the universe,\r\nand he claims, on behalf of science, as did the late Provost Jellett\r\nof the British Association, \"the right to prosecute its investigations\r\nuntil it attains to a mechanical explanation of all things.\"\r\n\r\nIn this lecture Professor Fitzgerald, commenting upon Professor Hertz's\r\nexperiments in the vibration of ether waves, says: \"If there is reason\r\nto think that any greater oscillation might disintegrate the atom,\r\nwe are still a long way from it.\" Does not this statement border on\r\nan admission that the atom may be divisible? Those who are pursuing\r\ntheir researches in this field are farther off than they know from the\r\ngreat central truth which Faraday did not live long enough to reach,\r\nalthough conjectured by him.\r\n\r\nWe have not only Faraday's discoveries, but those of Scheele,\r\nthe Swedish chemist, as an example of exact observations leading\r\nto erroneous conclusions. The investigations of Scheele led up to\r\nthe rich harvest which has since been reaped from a knowledge of\r\nthe nature of the compounds of organic chemistry. Scheele was one\r\nof the founders of quantitative analysis, but the phlogistic theory\r\nadvanced by him was overthrown--the fate of all theories which are\r\nnot based on solid foundations. Faraday admitted that his own ideas on\r\ngravitating force, and of the ether, were but vague impressions of his\r\nmind thrown out as matter for speculation. He left no theory on these\r\nlines, for he had nothing to offer as the result of demonstration,\r\nnor even of sufficient consideration to broach a theory: merely\r\nimpressions, which are allowable for a time as guides to thought\r\nand farther research. Yet more than once did these speculations\r\nof his giant intellect touch upon one of nature's hidden laws, the\r\ngreatest one yet made known to man. Had Faraday lived long enough\r\nto pursue his researches, from his starting point of conjecture,\r\nhe would have been, without doubt, instead of Keely, the discoverer\r\nof the latent or hidden potencies existing in all forms of matter,\r\nvisible and invisible. But the physicists of his time looked upon\r\nhis speculations as contrary to the received dogmas of science, and\r\npreferred their own errors to his speculations. They saw the signpost,\r\nbut took the road directly opposite to the one Faraday had pointed out.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that even a false theory, when rightly constructed, has\r\nits uses, and that, instead of hindering, it hastens the advance of\r\nknowledge. Every one, possessing the slightest acquaintance with the\r\nhistory of astronomy, knows that the doctrines of cycles, epicycles\r\nand ellipses, were begotten naturally and necessarily out of each\r\nother; and that if Kepler had not propounded speculative errors\r\nNewton would not have hit upon speculative truth. It has been said\r\nthat when men of science disclaim hypotheses, or speculation, they\r\nare either unfit for their vocation or, like Newton, they are better\r\nthan their creed. Hypotheses are at once the effect and the cause of\r\nprogress. One might as well attempt to preserve and employ an army\r\nwithout organization as to preserve and employ phenomena without a\r\ntheory to weld them into one. But the theory must be provisionally,\r\nif not positively, true; it must be intelligible and consistent;\r\nit must explain a greater number of facts and reconcile a greater\r\nvariety of apparent contradictions than any which has preceded it;\r\nand it must have become developed not by the addition merely, but by\r\nthe addition and solution, of subsidiary explanations. I ask of you\r\nan examination of Keely's theories before giving an opinion of them.\r\n\r\nTime only can decide whether Keely's hypotheses and theories\r\nwill outlive these tests. If not, his system must be overthrown,\r\nas past systems have been, to make room for a better one. All that\r\nI ask is that he may have the opportunity to develop it under your\r\nencouragement. There are scientists in Europe ready to assist him with\r\npecuniary assistance. They know enough--those who are interested in\r\nhis discoveries--to know that they can help him in no other way.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hertz of Bonn, said to me: \"Keely must work out his system\r\nhimself to that point where he can instruct physicists to repeat\r\nhis experiments.\" Picking up a photograph of Keely's instruments of\r\nresearch, grouped together, he added: \"No man is likely to be a fraud\r\nwho is working on these lines.\"\r\n\r\nScience is alert, on tiptoe as it were, waiting for the one mighty\r\nexplanation of the force, \"behind the framework of nature,\" which\r\nhas hitherto \"eluded its skill;\" and which the system of Keely makes\r\nclear to the understanding, demonstrating that one power, one law,\r\nreigns throughout creation; the immaterial controlling the material,\r\nafter the divine order and law of creation that the immaterial\r\nshould govern the material--that the whole realm of matter is under\r\nthe dominion of the immaterial. But \"the known always excludes the\r\nunknown\" when in opposition to it. As in past generations, so now in\r\nours, physicists have said: \"We will not waste our time in looking\r\nat facts and phenomena which cannot be accepted in opposition to\r\nestablished principles of science and to known laws of nature; and\r\nwhich, even if we beheld we should not believe.\"\r\n\r\nThe recognition and practical application of new truths are, as has\r\nbeen said, notoriously slow processes. Harvey's beneficent discovery\r\nexcited vehement opposition from his contemporaries. Professor Riolan\r\ncombated this discovery with as much obstinacy as violence; even\r\ndenying the existence and the functions of lymphatic vessels. Harvey\r\nhimself united with Riolan in opposing the discoveries of Aselli and\r\nPacquet respecting the lymphatic system. Jenner's discovery met with\r\nthe same opposition, and more than forty years elapsed before the\r\nsuggestion of Sir Humphrey Davy became of practical use. Mr. Wills was\r\nso affected by the ridicule which he encountered in his experiments\r\nwith nitrous oxide in destroying physical pain, that he abandoned\r\nthem. Nearly half a century later Dr. Morton was assailed by several of\r\nour journals in America for the use of ether in producing anæsthesia;\r\nas also was Sir James Simpson for his use of ether and chloroform.\r\n\r\nThe scientists excommunicated Dr. Wigan, who had proved by anatomical\r\nexamination that each brain-hemisphere is a perfect brain; that\r\nwe have, in fact, two brains, as we have two eyes and two ears. His\r\nexperiences as a physician were declared to be impostures or delusions;\r\nhis deductions fallacious. They could not be true, because they were\r\ninconsistent with the established principles of physiology and mental\r\nscience. And with such experiences in the past, we should keep in\r\nmind that the powers of nature are so mysterious and inscrutable\r\nthat men must be cautious in limiting them to the ordinary laws of\r\nexperience. Proclus wrote of the power of mind or will to set up\r\ncertain vibrations--not in the grosser atmospheric particles whose\r\nundulations beget light, sound, heat, electricity--but in the latent\r\nimmaterial principle of force, of which modern science knows scarcely\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nWhat is beyond their own power, men cannot comprehend to be in the\r\npower of others. Said Sextus: \"If by magic you mean a perpetual\r\nresearch among all that is most latent and obscure in nature, I\r\nprofess that magic, and he who does so comes nearer to the fountain\r\nof all knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton said: \"It is well known that bodies act upon one\r\nanother by the attractions of gravity, magnetism and electricity;\r\nand these instances show the tenour and course of nature, and make\r\nit not improbable that there may be more powers of attraction than\r\nthese. For nature is very consonant and conformable to herself.\"\r\n\r\nWith such intimations of the hidden force that is ever in operation,\r\n\"behind the framework of nature,\" shall we, because it is hidden\r\nfrom science, refuse to listen to the explanations which Mr. Keely\r\nis now prepared to give? All nature is a compound of conflicting,\r\nand therefore of counter-balancing and equilibrating, forces. Without\r\nthis there could be no such thing as stability. In nature nothing\r\nis great and nothing is little, writes Figuier. Sir Henry Roscoe\r\nsays: \"The structure of the smallest particle, invisible even to\r\nour most searching vision, may be as complicated as that of any of\r\nthe heavenly bodies which circle around our sun.\" If you admit this,\r\nas stated by one of your own orthodox scientists, why refuse to admit\r\nthe possibility of the subdivision of all corpuscles of matter, which\r\nKeely declares can be done by certain orders of vibration, thus showing\r\nup new elements? I do not ask endorsement of Keely's theories; but if\r\nphysicists did not think it possible to rupture the atom, would they be\r\ncalculating the chances of doing so, as Professor Fitzgerald has done?\r\n\r\nWhy not admit that certain tenets of science may prove to be nothing\r\nmore than hypotheses, too hastily adopted as theories, and that\r\nKeely has succeeded, as he claims, to have discovered the order of\r\nvibration, which by increasing the oscillation of the atom, causes it\r\nto rupture itself? This introductory impulse is given at forty-two\r\nthousand eight hundred vibrations, instead of one hundred millions;\r\nwhich, having been reached by Professor Hertz, failed to tear apart\r\nthe atom, and convinced Professor Fitzgerald of the \"long way off\"\r\nthat they still are from rupturing it. But even this conclusion\r\nwas arrived at under an erroneous hypothesis; for the atomic charge\r\ndoes not oscillate across the diameter of the atom, and its possible\r\nradiating power was calculated on this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the canons of science, which are proved by Mr. Keely's\r\nresearches to be erroneous: take the one which teaches that molecular\r\naggregation is ever attended with dissipation of energy. From\r\nwhence, then, comes the immense force which is liberated from the\r\nconstituents of gunpowder by its exciter, fire?--which is a certain\r\norder of vibration. Concussion, another order of vibration, releases\r\nthe hidden energy stored in the molecules of dynamite, which tears\r\nthe rocks asunder as if they were egg-shells. Still another order\r\nof vibration, which Keely has discovered, dissociates the supposed\r\nelements of water, releasing from its corpuscular embrace almost\r\nimmeasurable volumes of force.\r\n\r\nThe discoverer of this law of nature has long been harassed and made\r\nto feel like a galley-slave chained to a rock, while with Prometheus\r\naspirations he is seeking to bring down fire and light from heaven\r\nfor his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Leidy followed his impulse to leap the hedge which\r\ndivided his special field of research from the domain that Keely\r\nwas exploring, his was the first effort made by a man of science\r\nto save to the world \"the hidden knowledge\" bestowed upon one who,\r\nin my opinion, is alone capable of completing his system in a form to\r\ntransmit this knowledge to others. I doubt not that this will seem to\r\nyou as the language of fanaticism; but my convictions do not come from\r\nthings hoped for. They are the result of the evidence of things seen,\r\nyear after year, for nearly a decade of years.\r\n\r\nAs a school-girl, fifty years ago, I had the privilege of attending\r\ncourses of lectures at Yale College, where experiments were given in\r\nnatural philosophy and in chemistry; which kept up the interest that\r\nwas awakened in earlier years; when, with my mineral hammer and basket,\r\nmy father took me in his walks, laying the foundation of that love of\r\ntrue science which has made the discoveries of Keely of such intense\r\ninterest to me.\r\n\r\nSuperficial as was and still is my knowledge of science, in its various\r\nbranches, my interest has never abated; and thus, by my course of\r\nreading, I have kept myself abreast of the most advanced writers of\r\nmodern thought, preparing the way for the help that I have been able\r\nto give Mr. Keely by putting books into his hands which, after more\r\nthan twelve years of blind struggles to grapple with the force he had\r\nstumbled over, helped him to comprehend its nature, sooner than he\r\nwould have done had he been left to work out his conjectures unaided,\r\nhe tells me.\r\n\r\nMarvellous as is the extent of Keely's knowledge of vibratory physics,\r\nI doubt very much whether he knows enough of mechanical physics\r\nto perform the trickery which Professor Rowland accused him of\r\nattempting. \"Of course every one is looking for a trick where Keely\r\nis concerned,\" writes a Baltimore man; and, so long as speculations\r\nin the stock of the Keely Motor Company are authorized by the managers\r\nof that company, or efforts made to dispose of it before any practical\r\nresult is attained, so long will Keely be unjustly suspected of being\r\nin league with them to obtain money under false pretences.\r\n\r\nIt was after six or seven years of failure on the part of the\r\nstockholders of the company to furnish Keely with one dollar, even,\r\nthat I made a contract with him in April, 1890, to supply all that he\r\nneeded for the completion of his system; having first received the\r\nassurance of Mr. Keely's lawyer that he would carry out the united\r\nwishes of Mr. Keely and myself. At that time this announcement was\r\nmade in the public journals:--\r\n\r\n\"There has been placed in the hands of Professor Leidy a fund for\r\nthe use of inventor John W. Keely. The stipulation attached is that\r\nno use shall be made of the financial assistance for speculative\r\npurposes. This provision, which is made in the interests of the Keely\r\nMotor Company as well as for science, will end with the first attempt\r\nto speculate on the stock by exhibitions given of the operations\r\nof unpatentable engines. Professor Leidy holds the fund at his\r\ndisposition, and will pay all bills for instruments constructed for\r\nresearching purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe report issued last month by the directors of the Keely Motor\r\nCompany annulled this contract; and it now remains for your board\r\nto decide whether I shall, in behalf of science, continue to supply\r\nMr. Keely with the means of continuing his researches, under the\r\nprotecting auspices of the University of Pennsylvania, or leave him\r\nin the hands of those who are so blind to their own interests, as\r\nholders of stock in the Keely Motor Company, they cannot be made to\r\nsee that their only hope of commercial success lies in the completion\r\nof the system that Keely is developing; and that the course proposed\r\nby Professor Leidy, and commended by Professor Hertz and Professor\r\nFitzgerald, for Keely to follow, is the only one that will ever enable\r\nhim to complete it.\r\n\r\nThis system is as much a work of evolution as is any one of the slow\r\noperations of nature. \"Truth can afford to wait:\" she knows that the\r\nCreator of all things never hurries. In these twenty years of toil\r\nKeely's patient perseverance has been godlike. It is the sharpest\r\nrebuke that could be uttered to those whose impatient \"hue and cry\"\r\nhas been, \"Give us a commercial engine and we will immortalize\r\nyou;\"--grinding from him, meantime, seven-eighths of his interests\r\nin his inventions.\r\n\r\nBut in his labours Keely finds a recompense that, as yet, \"the world\r\nknows not of;\" for day by day he sees the once, to him, obscure\r\ndomain lit up with ever-increasing glory; a domain the boundaries\r\nof which are the boundaries of the universe: the entrance into which\r\npromises the fulfilment of the hopes of those who look forward to \"a\r\ntime when we shall no longer go to the blind to lead the blind in our\r\nsearch to make life worth living; but, instead, be able to promote,\r\nin accordance with scientific method and in harmony with law, the\r\nphysical, intellectual and moral evolution of our race.\"\r\n\r\nAs of Newton, with the change of one word only, so one day will it\r\nbe said of Keely:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        All intellectual eye--our solar round\r\n        First gazing through, he by the blended power\r\n        Of laws etheric, universal, saw\r\n        The whole in silent harmony revolve.\r\n        What were his raptures then! How pure! How strong!\r\n        And what the triumphs of old Greece and Rome\r\n        With his compared? When Nature and her laws\r\n        Stood all disclosed to him, and open laid\r\n        Their every hidden glory to his view.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of March, following the reading of this address, Professor\r\nKoenig, who had become deeply interested in Mr. Keely's researches,\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the experiments, which I saw at Mr. Keely's, I\r\nventure upon the following suggestion, as a test of the nature of the\r\nforce Mr. Keely is dealing with. The revolution of the compass as\r\na result of negative polar attraction. It is stated in Mr. Keely's\r\npaper that he finds gold, silver, platinum, to be excellent media\r\nfor the transmission of these triple currents. Now it is well known\r\nthat these same metals are most diamagnetic, that is, unaffected by\r\nmagnetic influences. If, therefore, a needle be made of one of these\r\nmetals and suspended in place of the steel needle, in the compass, and\r\nput under the influence of Mr. Keely's force, it ought to revolve the\r\nsame as the steel needle will under magnetic and polar and anti-polar\r\ninfluence. If Mr. Keely could make such a needle revolve, it would\r\nconvince me that he is dealing with a force unknown to physicists.\"\r\n\r\nTo this requirement Mr. Keely replied: \"To run a needle, composed of\r\nnon-magnetic material, by polar and depolar action is a matter of as\r\ninfinite impossibility as would be the raising of a heavy weight from\r\nthe bottom of a well by sucking a vacuum in it, or the inhalation of\r\nwater into the lungs instead of air, to sustain life.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, at Dr. Brinton's suggestion, Mr. Keely took up a line of\r\nresearch that was new to him, and succeeded in making a needle of\r\nthe three metals, gold, silver and platinum, rotate by differential\r\nmolecular action; induced by negative attractive outreach, which is\r\nas free of magnetic force as a cork.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brinton had so mastered Keely's working hypotheses as to say,\r\nearly in April, that he was sure he could make them understood by any\r\nintelligent person--writing of them: \"All that is needed now is to\r\nshow that Keely's experiments sustain the principles that underlie\r\nthese hypotheses. As soon as Professor Koenig is prepared to report\r\non the purely technical and physical character of the experiments,\r\nI shall be ready to go into full details as to their significance\r\nin reference to both matter and mind. It will be enough for me if\r\nDr. Koenig is enabled simply to say that the force handled by Keely\r\nis not any one of the already well-known forces. Let him say that,\r\nand I will undertake to say what it is.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 13th of April, the Provost of the University of\r\nPennsylvania, with others who were invited, met at Mrs. Moore's house\r\nto hear the report of the \"observation\" of Mr. Keely's researching\r\nexperiments. The result was not made public; as it was desired,\r\nby all concerned, that nothing should be made known which could in\r\nany way influence the price of the stock of the company, to which\r\nMr. Keely is under obligations; and which, as far as marketable value\r\nis concerned, is quite worthless until his system is completed to that\r\npoint where some one device or machine can be patented. But, after\r\nProfessor Koenig had made his report to those assembled, and Professor\r\nBrinton had read his abstract, all that had been asked for Mr. Keely,\r\nin behalf of the interests of science, was conceded to him. Mr. Keely\r\nhas been able to continue his researches, up to the present time,\r\nwithout the delays which actions-at-law would have occasioned.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brinton, before making public his \"Abstract of Keely's\r\nPhilosophy,\" wishes to add two parts, one on the difficulties in the\r\nway of physicists in understanding Keely's theories; the other on\r\nthe relations of the conditions of the inter-etheric order to the\r\nlaws of mind.\r\n\r\nThe address of Mrs. Moore, type-copied, was sent to various editors\r\nand men of science in Philadelphia, as well as to leading capitalists;\r\nand, in this crisis of Keely's connection with the stockholders of The\r\nKeely Motor Company, some of these editors rendered substantial aid in\r\nmaking known his critical position; most notably the Inquirer, owned\r\nby Mr. Elverson, and the Evening Telegraph, owned by Mr. Warburton,\r\nwith the result that a decided change in public opinion took place,\r\nafter these journals announced, in April, that Professor Koenig\r\nhad tested the energy, employed by Keely, with the most sensitive\r\ngalvanometer of the university, in the presence of Professor Leidy,\r\nProfessor Brinton, Doctor Tuttle (a Baltimore physicist) and others,\r\nfinding no trace of electricity; and by other tests no magnetism. The\r\ntwo professors who thoroughly investigated Keely's theories, and\r\nobserved his demonstrations, were chosen because they possessed\r\nthe qualities of mind which Herbert Spencer said constitute the\r\nfirst condition of success in scientific research, viz. \"an honest\r\nreceptivity and a willingness to abandon all preconceived notions,\r\nhowever cherished, if they be found to contradict the truth.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Leidy and Dr. Willcox, during their observations of Keely's\r\nprogressive experimental researches, had expressed no opinion of\r\nKeely's theories, other than that they did not correspond with\r\ntheir own ideas; but Professor Koenig boldly said, \"I not only\r\nthink Mr. Keely's theories possible, but I consider them quite\r\nprobable.\" Professor Brinton, who made a study of Keely's theories, so\r\nmastered them as to be able to suggest to Keely a new line of research,\r\nrequired by Dr. Koenig in the tests proposed; and the synopsis of\r\nKeely's philosophy, prepared by Doctor Brinton, has made Keely's\r\nhitherto unintelligible language intelligible to men of science.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this favourable result, a New York journalist, under\r\na fictitious name, pretended to have discovered that Keely is a fraud,\r\nusing well-known forces; which statements were published (with woodcuts\r\nof instruments discarded by Keely two years before) in the New York\r\nHerald and The Press, in Philadelphia. It is amusing to see how\r\n\"history repeats itself;\" for, in the year 1724, in a letter to the\r\nRoyal Society, Hatzfeldt attacked Sir Isaac Newton in much the same\r\nspirit. One would suppose in reading what Hatzfeldt has written of\r\nan invention of his time, that it had been written, word for word, of\r\nthis ignorant investigator of Keely's experiments in researching. After\r\ncommenting upon the corruption of human nature as shown, in his day,\r\nby want of veracity, and the tendency to vicious misrepresentation,\r\nhe says: \"If the said machine was contrived according to the weak\r\nsense and understanding of those who pretend it to be moved in other\r\nways than that declared, it would have been discerned before this.\r\n\r\n\"And those who pretend it to be moved by water, or air, or magnetism,\r\none of which (meaning water) even our most famous author did in the\r\nbeginning affirm it to be moved by, is so very weak that I don't at\r\nall think it deserving to be considered.\r\n\r\n\"And what is still worse, to pretend it to be a cheat is a manner\r\nof proceeding which is neither consistent with equity nor common\r\nsense. As long as arts and sciences have the misfortune of depending\r\non the direction of such like persons, no progress toward truth can\r\nbe made, but I shall make it sufficiently appear that there is yet\r\nmore truth behind the hill than ever has been brought to light. There\r\nbe persons who, when disappointed of gain, turn their shafts against\r\nthose who have circumvented them.\r\n\r\n\"All those who know anything of philosophy know that gravity is\r\ngenerally (and chiefly by Sir Isaac Newton and his followers) denied\r\nto be essential to matter, which I shall not only prove the contrary\r\nof, but I shall likewise show the properties in matter, on which\r\nthe principle depends, to be the most glorious means to prove the\r\nexistence of God, and to establish natural religion.\"\r\n\r\nIs it not rather remarkable that, after a sleep of nearly two\r\ncenturies, it is again claimed that gravity is inherent in all matter?\r\n\r\nIt has been very generally supposed that Keely is working at haphazard,\r\nas it were; in other words, that he has no theory to go upon. Professor\r\nBrinton writes of Keely's theories: \"Mr. Keely has a coherent and\r\nintelligent theory of things, or philosophy, on which he lays out his\r\nwork and proceeds in his experiments.\" March 6th, the same professor\r\nwrites: \"Keely's paper on Latent Force in intermolecular spaces is\r\nclear enough and instructive, but the average reader will find the\r\nperusal up-hill work, from lack of preliminary teaching. Naturally,\r\nMr. Keely, whose mind has been busy with this topic for years, and\r\nwho is more familiar with it than with any other, does not appreciate\r\nhow blankly ignorant of it is the average reader. Also naturally he\r\nwrites above the heads of his audience.\"\r\n\r\nA correspondent in Invention, London, writes December 12, 1891: We\r\nhave at various times in these columns alluded to the investigations\r\nof the Philadelphia scientist, J. W. Keely, and this researcher--who\r\nis now stated to be engaged in finding a method whereby the power [18]\r\nwhich he professes to have discovered can be employed as a motor in\r\nthe place of steam--is just now the object of considerable attention\r\nin the press of the United States. To summarize the present state\r\nof the criticism to which this man is subjected, we may mention that\r\nfor some time past The New York Herald, among other papers, has been\r\nprinting a series of articles that have been recently prepared by an\r\nAmerican inventor named Browne, professing to show how Keely has,\r\nfor nearly twenty years, been deceiving expert engineers, shrewd\r\nmen of the world, some few university professors and others, by\r\nthe use of compressed air, obtaining testimonials of his discovery\r\nof an unknown force in nature. In reading his articles any one who\r\nhas seen the photographs--as the writer has done--of the researching\r\ninstruments discarded by Keely, in past years, and those that he is\r\nnow employing in their place, cannot fail to detect the misstatements\r\nand misrepresentations made.\r\n\r\nMr. Browne (?) even overrides the testimony of the late Professor\r\nLeidy, Dr. Willcox, Dr. Koenig, Dr. Brinton--the Baltimore\r\nphysicist--Dr. Tuttle, and the engineers Linville and Le Van, all\r\nof whom have tested the force used by Keely, and admitted that no\r\nelectricity, no magnetism, no compressed air is used. Without endorsing\r\nin the slightest anything that Keely has discovered, or claims to have\r\ndiscovered, we think that, with the English love of fair play, both\r\nsides should always fairly be heard before either is condemned, and as\r\nMr. Keely has consented to instruct a well-known English physicist in\r\nhis method of producing the force handled, there is every chance of\r\nthe truth being known, and the correct state of the matter divulged\r\nto the scientific world at large, when, mayhap, this rival inventor\r\nmay have to retract his assertions or stand a suit for libel. We do\r\nnot say it will be so--we only assert it may be. Professor Brinton,\r\nwho has made a study of Keely's methods, writes this month to a\r\nfriend in London:--\"The exposé of Keely's alleged methods continues\r\neach week. Some of the proposed explanations are plausible, others\r\nare plainly absurd. They only serve to attract renewed attention to\r\nKeely. I have written to the editor to ask him to arrange a meeting\r\nfor me with the writer, but I have not yet been able to discover the\r\nMr. Browne, [19] of Brooklyn, who is the supposititious author.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Keely has chosen the successor [20] of Professor Tyndall, at the\r\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain, as the physicist to whom he will\r\ncommunicate his method. This will be welcome news indeed to scientists\r\non both sides of the Atlantic, and the result will be awaited with\r\nanxiety alike by both the friends and foes of Keely. We shall watch\r\nfor the result, as will our American confrères.--Wm. Norman Brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nMORE OF KEELY'S THEORIES.--HIS TRADUCERS EXPOSED.\r\n\r\n        It was in India that man first recognized the fact that\r\n        force is indestructible and eternal. This implies ideas more\r\n        or less distinct of that which we now term its correlation\r\n        and conservation. The changes which we witness are in its\r\n        distribution.--Professor Draper.\r\n\r\n        \"For all things that be not true, be lies.\"\r\n\r\n        There is a principle in music which has yet to be\r\n        discovered.--Sir John Herschel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Chicago Tribune.\r\n\r\nThat was a happy inspiration which led the Quintet Club, of\r\nPhiladelphia, to pay a visit to the workshop of Keely a few weeks\r\nago. Its members had been told that the illustrious inventor had\r\nemployed the power of music to develop the wonderful forces of nature,\r\nand evolve by a law of sympathetic vibrations a mighty energy through\r\nthe disintegration of a few drops of water. Naturally they were\r\nanxious to go. They were familiar with the claim made by Paganini\r\nthat he could throw down a building if he knew the chord of the mass\r\nof masonry, and wanted to know if it were possible that the dream of\r\nthe great violinist is realized at last.\r\n\r\nSo nearly as can be made out from the mysterious language of the\r\nman of many promises, there is a harmony of the universe that is\r\ncontrollable by the strains of music. Each of the molecules composing\r\na mass of matter is in a state of incessant oscillation, and these\r\nmovements can be so much changed by means of musical vibration that\r\nthe matter will be disintegrated, its constituent molecules fly\r\napart, and a propulsive force be generated similar to that which is\r\nevolved by the touching of a match to a single grain of powder stored\r\nin a magazine. He holds that matter is nothing but forces held in\r\nequilibrium, and that if the equilibrium be once destroyed the most\r\ntremendous consequences will ensue.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report, he proved to the satisfaction of more than one\r\nmember of the club that he has already discovered the means of calling\r\nout this force, and is able to partially control it. In their presence\r\nhe caused a heavy sphere to rotate rapidly or slowly, according to\r\nthe notes given by the instrument on which he played. The sphere was\r\nso isolated as to prove that it could not be acted on by electricity\r\nor in any other way than by the sound waves. He disintegrated water\r\ninto what he calls \"etheric vapour\" by means of a tuning fork and\r\na zither. The disintegration of only four drops of water produced a\r\npressure of 27,000 pounds to the square inch, and three drops of the\r\nharmless liquid fired off a cannon \"with a tremendous roar.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is wonderful--if true. And it is strangely parallel to the\r\nmost advanced lines of modern thought in a scientific direction, if not\r\ncoincident with them. There is the point. Is there a \"thin partition\"\r\ndividing the wisdom of the schools from the insanity of Keely, or will\r\nhe yet prove his right to take rank among the greatest of earth's\r\ninventors? If he can do what is at present claimed for him, doing\r\nit honestly and without any hocus-pocus to beguile the fools, he has\r\nalready earned a title higher than that worn by any man of the age. If\r\nhe is simply cheating those to whom he exhibits his mechanism, he is\r\none of the biggest charlatans that ever drew breath, and ought to be\r\nscouted accordingly. And here is the difficulty. The visit alluded to\r\nis claimed to have been made on May 9th, or fully six weeks ago. Surely\r\nif such results were achieved then, as reported by the Philadelphia\r\nInquirer, many others would ere this have been asked and permitted to\r\nwitness a repetition of the experiments, and the scientific world would\r\nnow be in a blaze of excited admiration of the man and his methods. But\r\nnothing further is said about it. Keely is still plodding away in his\r\nworkshop, and the world is still rolling round in happy ignorance of\r\nwhat he has done towards revolutionizing existing lines of thought and\r\nmodes of action. Surely something is radically wrong. The scientists\r\nowe it to themselves as well as to the inventor to see to it that\r\nthis condition is not allowed to continue. They should appoint a\r\ncommission to investigate, and find out whether Keely is a genius\r\nworthy of the highest honours and rewards that can be bestowed,\r\nan arrant impostor, whose fittest place would be the penitentiary,\r\nor a crank that ought to be put in a lunatic asylum. It is hard to\r\nresist the conclusion that he is one or the other of these, and in\r\neither case he is not getting his deserts. Let Keely be scientifically\r\ninvestigated. He has been permitted to remain in obscurity too long\r\nalready. He should be reported on, no matter whether the result be\r\nto raise a mortal to the skies or send an alleged angel down to the\r\ndepths of infamy as a life-long deceiver of his species.\"\r\n\r\n[The Tribune is informed that the report was correct in every\r\nparticular, and that Professor D. G. Brinton, of the University of\r\nPennsylvania, has prepared a paper on the subject, and will publish it\r\nwhen Mr. Keely is ready to have his system made known.--Ed. Inquirer.]\r\n\r\nThe writer of this article in the Chicago Tribune has expressed\r\nthe prevailing sentiment of our time, in regard to Keely, as far\r\nas those are concerned who are in ignorance of the fact that Keely\r\nhas discovered an unknown energy, and is working out a system which\r\nhe must himself first learn, by researches into the laws of nature\r\ngoverning it, before he can apply it to mechanics, or make it even\r\nso much as understood by others.\r\n\r\nThe unprincipled journalist before alluded to, after failing in an\r\nattempt to obtain admission to Mr. Keely's workshop, wrote a series\r\nof articles for the press, recounting Keely's researching experiments\r\nin 1889 and 1890, as then shown to Professor Joseph Leidy, Dr. James\r\nWillcox, and others. This journalist, who professed to give woodcuts\r\nof Keely's researching instruments, was entirely ignorant of the fact\r\nthat the experiments which he described had never once been repeated,\r\nduring the last eighteen months; Keely having taken up researches\r\non another line, as soon as he had gained sufficient control of the\r\nforce he was handling to cause the solid bronze weight weighing six\r\nand three quarters lbs., to rise in the jar, rest midway, or remain\r\nstationary at will. The \"Generator,\" described by this journalist in\r\nthe Philadelphia Press of November 1st, 1891, never had any existence\r\nbeyond the journalist's brain and the woodcut. It was represented as\r\na square structure, \"big and thick walled enough to hold a donkey\r\nengine,\" whereas the true disintegrator (or improved generator) is\r\nround, and about the size of the wheel of a baby's perambulator. This\r\nform of generator Mr. Keely has been using for about three years;\r\nsuspending it from a staple in the ceiling, or against the wall,\r\nwhen using it in the dissociation of the so-called elements of\r\nwater. Consequently, it was impossible for the force to be \"conducted\r\nfrom a reservoir eight or ten squares distance,\" as suggested by\r\nthis inventing journalist, who says that he \"spent sleepless nights\"\r\nin devising the way in which the generator was operated by Keely:\r\nasserting that \"this extraordinary force was loaded like electricity\r\nthrough a wire and discharged like steam through a pipe.\"\r\n\r\nIn a romance called \"The Prince and the Pauper\" these lines occur:\r\n\"For, look you, an it were not true, it would be a lie. It surely\r\nwould be. Think on't. For all things that be not true, be lies,--thou\r\ncanst make nought else out of it.\" Never were truer words written,\r\nand equally true is it that, as another author has written, \"If\r\nthe boy who cannot speak the truth, lives to be a man, and becomes\r\na journalist, he will invent lie after lie as long as he can get a\r\nJournal to print them and to pay him for them.\" There are very few men,\r\nwho take up journalism in the spirit of a St. Beuve. Quite as few are\r\nthere who are competent to write, in any way, of Keely's discoveries\r\nand all that they involve. Even among men of science, only one man\r\nhas been found who is able to comprehend Keely's theories, and to\r\nhandle them in a way to make them intelligible to others. S. Laing, in\r\n\"Modern Thought,\" says, \"Science traces everything back to primeval\r\natoms and germs, and there it leaves us. How came these atoms and\r\nenergies there, from which this wonderful universe of worlds has\r\nbeen evolved by inevitable laws? What are they in their essence,\r\nand what do they mean? The only answer is, \"It is unknowable. It is\r\nbehind the veil. Spirit may be matter, matter may be spirit.\" Keely's\r\nresearches have been of a nature which, grappling with these mysteries,\r\nhas brought them to the light. He tells us that spirit is the soul\r\nof matter, and that no matter exists without a soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore of Keely's Theories.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic conditions that we call mind are no more immaterial in\r\ntheir character than light or electricity. The substance of the brain\r\nis molecular, while the substance of the mind that permeates the brain\r\nis inter-etheric, and is the element by which the brain is impregnated;\r\nexciting it into action and controlling all the conditions of physical\r\nmotion, as long as the sympathetic equatative is in harmony, as between\r\nthe first, second, and third orders of transmission; molecular, atomic\r\nand etheric. By this soul-substance is the physical controlled. In\r\norder to trace the successive triple impulses, taking the introductory\r\none of sympathetic negative outreach, towards the cerebral neutrals,\r\nwhich awakens the latent element to action, we find that mind may be\r\nconsidered a specific order of inter-atomic motion sympathetically\r\ninfluenced by the celestial flow, and that it becomes when thus excited\r\nby this medium a part and parcel of the celestial itself. Only under\r\nthese conditions of sympathetic assimilation can it assert its power\r\nover the physical organisms; the finite associated with the infinite.\r\n\r\nThe brain is not a laboratory. It is as static as the head of the\r\npositive negative attractor, [21] until influenced by certain orders\r\nof vibration, when it reveals the true character of the outreach\r\nso induced. The brain is the high resonating receptacle where the\r\nsympathetic celestial acts, and where molecular and atomic motion\r\nexhibits itself, as according to the intensification brought to bear\r\nupon it by the celestial mind flow.\r\n\r\nThe cerebral forces, in their control of the physical organism,\r\nreveal to us the infinite power of the finer or spiritual fluid,\r\nthough not immaterial, over the crude molecular. The luminous, etheric,\r\nprotoplastic element, which is the highest tenuous condition of the\r\nether, fills the regions of infinite space, and in its radiating\r\noutreach gives birth to the prime neutral centres that carry the\r\nplanetary worlds through their ranges of motion.\r\n\r\nIf the minds of all the most learned sages, of all time, were\r\nconcentrated, into one mind, that one would be too feeble, in its\r\nmental outreach, to comprehend the conditions associated with the\r\nfourth order of sympathetic condensation. The controversies of the\r\npast in regard to the condensation of invisible matter prove this. The\r\nchemistry of the infinite and the chemistry of the finite are as wide\r\napart, in their sympathetic ranges, as is the velocity of light from\r\nthe movement of the hour-hand of a clock. Even the analysis of the\r\nvisible conditions taxes our highest powers of concentration.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, Why is this condition of ether always\r\nunder a state of luminosity of an especial order? Its characteristics\r\nare such, from its infinite tenuity and the sympathetic activity\r\nwith which it is impregnated, that it possesses an order of\r\nvibratory, oscillatory velocity, which causes it to evolve its own\r\nluminosity. This celestial, latent power, that induces luminosity\r\nin this medium, is the same that registers in all aggregated forms\r\nof matter, visible and invisible. It is held in corpuscular embrace\r\nuntil liberated by a compound vibratory negative medium.\r\n\r\nWhat does this activity represent, by which luminosity is induced in\r\nthe high etheric realm? Does not the force following permeation by\r\nthe Divine Will show that even this order of ether, this luminiferous\r\nregion, is bounded by a greater region still beyond?--that it is but\r\nthe shore which borders the realm, from which the radiating forces of\r\nthe Infinite emanate: the luminiferous being the intermediate which\r\ntransfers the will force of the Almighty towards the neutral centres\r\nof all created things, animate and inanimate, visible and invisible;\r\neven down into the very depths of all molecular masses. The activity\r\nof the corpuscles, in all aggregations, represents the outflow of\r\nthis celestial force, from the luminiferous track, towards all these\r\nmolecular centres of neutrality, and reveals to us the connecting link\r\nbetween mind and matter. How plainly are we thus taught that God is\r\neverywhere, and at the same time in every place. It gives us a new\r\nsense of the omniscience and omnipresence of the Creator. In these\r\nresearches I am brought so near to the celestial conditions that my\r\npen is ready to fall from my hand while writing on this subject; so\r\nmore and more sensibly do I feel my abject ignorance of its depths....\r\n\r\nThese conditions of luminosity have no thermal forces associated\r\nwith them; although, paradoxically, all thermal conditions emanate\r\nfrom that source. The tenuity of this element accounts for it. It is\r\nonly when these sympathetic streams come in conflict with the cruder\r\nelementary conditions, either the molecular or atomic, that heat is\r\nevolved from its latent state, and a different order of light from\r\nthe etheric luminous is originated, which has all the high conditions\r\nof thermal force associated with it: the sun being the intermediate\r\ntransmitter. Thus is shown the wonderful velocity of these sympathetic\r\nstreams emanating from celestial space.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic forces transmitted by our solar planet, to which\r\nour earth is so susceptible, are continuously received from the\r\nluminiferous realm; the sympathetic volume of which, as expended, is\r\nconstantly equated by the exhaustless will-force of the Creator. Had\r\nthe solar energy been subservient to what physicists ascribe it,\r\nthe sun would have been a dead planet thousands of centuries ago,\r\nas also all planets depending upon it as an intermediate.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all planetary masses are sympathetic-transferring-mediums,\r\nor intermediates, of this prime, luminous, dominant element. In the\r\nvibratory subdivision of matter, as progressive evolution has been\r\nanalyzed, it is evident that these transfers of sympathetic force\r\nextend beyond the limits of our orbital range, from system to system,\r\nthroughout the realms of space: these progressive systems becoming\r\nthemselves, after a certain range of sympathetic motion, sympathetic\r\nintermediates, as included in the whole of one system, exemplified\r\nso beautifully in the cerebral convolutions, with their connective\r\nsympathy for each other; transferring as a whole on the focalizing\r\ncentre, from which it radiates to all parts of the physical organism,\r\ncontrolling in all its intricate variety the sympathetic action,\r\nof our movements.\r\n\r\n\"What is there that we really know?\" asks Buckle. \"We talk of the\r\nlaw of gravitation, and yet we know not what gravitation is; we\r\ntalk of the conservation of force and distribution of forces, and we\r\nknow not what forces are.\" \"The vibratory principles now discovered\r\nin physics,\" says Hemstreet, \"are so fine and attenuated that they\r\nbecome an analogy to mental or cerebral vibrations.\" Let us see what\r\nKeely's system of vibratory physics says of gravity, cohesion, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat is Gravity?--Gravity is an eternal existing condition in etheric\r\nspace, from which all visible forms are condensed. Consequently,\r\nit is inherent in all forms of matter, visible and invisible. It is\r\nnot subject to time nor space. It is an established connective link\r\nbetween all forms of matter from their birth, or aggregation. Time is\r\nannihilated by it, as it has already traversed space when the neutral\r\ncentres of the molecules were established.\r\n\r\nGravity, then, is nothing more than an attractive, sympathetic\r\nstream, flowing towards the neutral centre of the earth, emanating\r\nfrom molecular centres of neutrality; concordant with the earth's\r\ncentre of neutrality, and seeking its medium of affinity with a power\r\ncorresponding to the character of the molecular mass.\r\n\r\nWhat is Cohesion?--Cohesion is sympathetic negative attraction. It\r\nis the negative, vibratory assimilation, or aggregation, of the\r\nmolecules, acting according to the density or compactness of the\r\nmolecular groupings on their structures. The differing character\r\nof molecular densities, or molecular range of motion, represents\r\ndiffering powers of attraction. The lower the range of motions on\r\nthe molecular vibrations of these structures, the greater is the\r\nattractive force that holds them together; and vice versâ.\r\n\r\nWhat is Heat? Heat may be classed as a vibro-atomic element, not\r\nexceeding 14,000 vibrations per second at its greatest intensity,\r\nlatent in all conditions of matter both visible and invisible. The\r\nvelocity of the sympathetic flows which emanate from our solar\r\nworld, the sun, coming into contact with our atmospheric medium,\r\nliberates this element in all the different degrees of intensity that\r\ngive warmth to our earth. Light is another resultant; the different\r\nintensities of which are produced according to the different angles\r\nof this sympathetic projectment.\r\n\r\nThe light that emanates from a glow-worm is the resultant of the\r\naction of the sympathetic medium of the insect itself on a centre\r\nof phosphorescent matter, which is included in its structure. The\r\nresultant of the two conditions are quite different, but they are\r\ngoverned by the same laws of sympathetic percussion.\r\n\r\nRadiation is the term used to express the reaching out of the thermal\r\nelement, after its liberation from its corpuscular imprisonment, to be\r\nre-absorbed or returned again to its sympathetic environment; teaching\r\nus a lesson in the equation of disturbance of sympathetic equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForce.\r\n\r\n\"By what means is force exerted, and what definitely is force? Given\r\nthat force can be exerted by an act of will, do we understand the\r\nmechanism by which this is done? And if there is a gap in our knowledge\r\nbetween the conscious idea of a motion and the liberation of muscular\r\nenergy needed to accomplish it, how do we know that a body may not\r\nbe moved without ordinary material contact by an act of will?\" These\r\nquestions were asked by Professor Lodge in his paper on \"Time;\" and\r\nas Keely contends that all metallic substances after having been\r\nsubjected to a certain order of vibration may be so moved, let us\r\nsee how he would answer these questions. When Faraday endeavoured\r\nto elaborate some of his \"unscientific notions in regard to force\r\nand matter,\" men of science then said that Faraday's writings were\r\nnot translatable into scientific language. The same has been said of\r\nKeely's writings. Pierson says, \"The very fact that there is about the\r\nproduct of another's genius what you and I cannot understand is a proof\r\nof genius, i.e., of a superior order of faculties.\" Keely, who claims\r\nto have discovered the existence of hidden energy in all aggregations\r\nof matter, imprisoned there by the infinite velocity of molecular\r\nrotation, asserts that \"physicists in their mental rambles in the\r\nrealm of analytical chemistry, analytical as understood by them, have\r\nfailed to discover the key-note which is associated with the flow of\r\nthe mental element;\" that \"they have antagonized or subverted all the\r\nconditions,\" in this unexplored territory of negative research, which\r\nhe has demonstrated as existing in reference to latent energy locked in\r\ncorpuscular space. These antagonisms might have been sooner removed had\r\nthose physicists who witnessed some of Keely's experiments, while he\r\nwas still working blindfold as it were, in past years, not belonged\r\nto that class of scientists \"who only see what they want to see,\r\nand who array facts and figures adroitly on the side of preconceived\r\nopinion.\" Since the last meeting of the British Association, Keely,\r\nin writing of some of the addresses delivered, says: \"It delights me\r\nto find that physicists are verging rapidly toward a region which,\r\nwhen they reach, will enable them to declare to the scientific world\r\nwhat they now deny; viz., that immense volumes of energy exist in all\r\nconditions of corpuscular spaces. My demonstrations of this truth have\r\nbeen ignored by them and now they must find it out for themselves. I do\r\nnot doubt that they will reach it in their own way. I accept Professor\r\nStoney's idea that an apsidal motion might be caused by an interaction\r\nbetween high and low tenuous matter; but such conditions, even of\r\nthe highest accelerated motion, are too far down below the etheric\r\nrealm to influence it sympathetically, even in the most remote way. I\r\nmean by this that no corpuscular action, nor interaction can disturb\r\nor change the character of etheric vibrations. The conception of the\r\nmolecule disturbing the ether, by electrical discharges from its parts,\r\nis not correct; as the highest conditions associated with electricity\r\ncome under the fourth descending order of sympathetic condensation,\r\nand consequently its corpuscular realm is too remote to take any\r\npart towards etheric disturbance. Hypothesis is one thing and actual\r\nexperimental demonstration is another; one being as remote from the\r\nother as the electrical discharges from the recesses of the molecule\r\nare from the tenuous condition of the universal ether. The conjecture\r\nas regards the motion being a series of harmonic elliptic ones,\r\naccompanied by a slow apsidal one, I believe to be correct.... The\r\ncombination of these motions would necessarily produce two circular\r\nmotions of different amplitudes whose differing periods might\r\ncorrespond to two lines of the spectrum, as conjectured, and lead\r\nthe experimenter, perhaps, into a position corresponding to an\r\nocular illusion. Every line of the spectrum, I think, consists not\r\nof two close lines, but of compound triple lines: though not until\r\nan instrument has been constructed, which is as perfect in its parts\r\nas is the sympathetic field that environs matter, can any truthful\r\nconclusion be arrived at from demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Keely claims to have demonstrated\r\nthe subdivision of matter in seven distinct orders: molecular,\r\nintermolecular, atomic, inter-atomic, etheric, inter-etheric, reaching\r\nthe compound inter-etheric in the seventh order. In commenting further\r\nupon the experimental researches of men of science to show whether\r\nether in contact with moving matter is affected by the motion of\r\nsuch matter, Keely writes: \"The motion of any matter of less tenuity\r\nthan the ether cannot affect it any more than atmospheric air could\r\nbe held under pressure in a perforated chamber. The tenuous flow of\r\na magnet cannot be waived aside by a plate of heavy glass, and yet\r\nthe magnetic flow is only of an inter-atomic character and far more\r\ncrude than the introductory etheric. The etheric element would remain\r\nperfectly static under the travel of the most furious cyclone; it would\r\npass through the molecular interstices of any moving projectile with\r\nthe same facility that atmospheric air would pass though a coarse\r\nsieve. Ether could not be affected by the motion of less tenuous\r\nmatter, but if the matter were of the same tenuous condition it would\r\nsympathetically associate itself with it; consequently there would\r\nbe no motion any more than motion accompanies gravity.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that the mind flow induces motion on the physical\r\norganism, sympathetic flows on molecular masses induce motion on\r\nthe molecular. The motion of the molecules in all vegetable and\r\nmineral forms in nature are the results of the sympathetic force of\r\nthe celestial mind flow, or the etheric luminous, over terrestrial\r\nmatter. This celestial flow is the controlling medium of the universe,\r\nand one of its closest associates is gravity.... The molecule is\r\na world in itself, carrying with it all the ruling sympathetic\r\nconditions which govern the greatest of the planetary masses. It\r\noscillates within its etheric rotating envelope with an inconceivable\r\nvelocity, without percussing its nearest attendant, and is always\r\nheld within its sphere of action by the fixed gravital power of its\r\nneutral centre, in the same sympathetic order that exists between\r\nthe planetary worlds. The dissociation of aggregated molecules by\r\nintermolecular vibration does not disturb even to an atomic degree\r\nthese fixed neutral points. Each molecule contributes its quota to\r\nthe latent electrical force, which shows up by explosion after its\r\ngathering in the storm clouds, and then it returns to the molecular\r\nembrace it originally occupied. You may call this return, absorption;\r\nbut it gets there first during corpuscular aggregation, and comes from\r\nthere, or shows itself, during sympathetic disturbance of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of electricity, the harmonic and enharmonic,\r\nwhich, with their leader, the dominant, form the first triple. Their\r\nsympathetic associations evolve the energy of matter. The dominant\r\nis electricity luminous, or propulsive positive. The harmonic, or\r\nthe magnetic, which is the attractive, with its wonderful sympathetic\r\noutreach, is the negative current of the triune stream. The enharmonic,\r\nor high neutral, acts as the assimilative towards the reinstatement\r\nof sympathetic disturbance. In electric lighting, the velocity of\r\nthe dynamos accumulates only the harmonic current--by atomic and\r\ninter-atomic conflict--transferring one two hundred thousandth of the\r\nlight that the dominant current would give, if it were possible to\r\nconstruct a device whereby it could be concentrated and dispersed. But\r\nthis supreme portion can never be handled by any finite mode. Each\r\nof these currents has its triple flow, representing the true lines\r\nof the sympathetic forces that are constantly assimilating with\r\nthe polar terrestrial envelope. The rotation of the earth is one\r\nof the exciters that disturbs the equilibrium of these sensitive\r\nstreams. The alternate light and darkness induced by this motion\r\nhelps to keep up the activity of these streams, and the consequent\r\nassimilation and dissimilation. The light zone being ever followed\r\nby the dark zone, holds the sympathetic polar wave constant in its\r\nfluctuations. This fact may be looked upon as the foundation of the\r\nfable that the world rests upon a tortoise. The rotation of the earth\r\nis controlled and continued by the action of the positive and negative\r\nsympathetic celestial streams. Its pure and steady motion, so free\r\nfrom intermitting impulses, is governed to the most minute mathematical\r\nnicety by the mobility of the aqueous portion of its structure, i.e.,\r\nits oceans and ocean's anastomosis. There is said to be a grain of\r\ntruth in the wildest fable, and herein we have the elephant that the\r\ntortoise stands on. The fixed gravital centres of neutrality, the\r\nsympathetic concordants to the celestial outreach, that exist in the\r\ninter-atomic position, are the connective sympathetic links whereby\r\nthe terrestrial is held in independent suspension. We cannot say that\r\nthis corresponds to what the elephant stands upon, but we can say,\r\n\"This is the power whereby the elephant is sympathetically suspended.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atom.\r\n\r\nQuestion asked in Clerk Maxwell's memoirs: \"Under what form, right,\r\nor light, can an atom be imagined?\" Keely replies, It eludes the grasp\r\nof the imagination, for it is the introductory step to a conception\r\nof the eternity of the duration of matter. The magnitude of the\r\nmolecule, as compared to the inter-atom, is about on the same ratio\r\nas a billiard ball to a grain of sand; the billiard ball being the\r\ndomain wherein the triple inter-molecules rotate, the inter-molecules\r\nagain being the field wherein the atomic triplets sympathetically\r\nact, and again progressively, in the inter-atomic field, the first\r\norder of the etheric triplets begins to show its sympathetic inreach\r\nfor the centres of neutral focalization. It is impossible for the\r\nimagination to grasp such a position. Inter-atomic subdivision\r\ncomes under the order of the fifth dimensional space in etheric\r\ncondensation. Atoms and corpuscules can be represented by degrees\r\nof progressive tenuity, as according to progressive subdivision,\r\nbut to imagine the ultimate position of the atomic alone would be\r\nlike trying to take a measurement of immeasurable space. We often\r\nspeak of the borders of the infinite. No matter what the outreach\r\nmay be, nor how minute the corpuscular subdivision, we still remain\r\non the borders, looking over the far beyond, as one on the shore of\r\na boundless ocean who seeks to cross it with his gaze. Therefore,\r\nphilosophically speaking, as the atom belongs to the infinite and the\r\nimagination to the finite, it can never be comprehended in any form\r\nor light, nor by any right; for in the range of the imagination it\r\nis as a bridge of mist which can never be crossed by any condition\r\nthat is associated with a visible molecular mass, that is, by mind\r\nas associated with crude matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSympathetic Outreach\r\n\r\nis not induction. They are quite foreign to each other in\r\nprinciple. Sympathetic outreach is the seeking for concordance\r\nto establish an equation on the sympathetic disturbance of\r\nequilibrium. When a magnet is brought into contact with a keeper,\r\nthere is no induction of magnetism from the magnet into the keeper. The\r\nstatic force of the magnet remains unchanged, and the action between\r\nthe two may be compared to a sympathetic outreach of a very limited\r\nrange of motion. The sympathetic outreach of the moon towards the\r\nearth, has a power strong enough to extend nearly a quarter of a\r\nmillion of miles to lift the oceans out of their beds. This is not\r\nthe power of induction....\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic envelope of our earth owes its volume and its activity\r\nentirely to celestial radiating forces. Reception and dispersion are\r\nkept up by atomic and inter-atomic conflict, as between the dominant\r\nand enharmonic.\r\n\r\nSilver represents the 3rd, gold the 6th, and platina the 9th, in\r\ntheir links of association, one to the other, in the molecular range\r\nof their motions, when submitted to vibratory impulses.\r\n\r\nIf an introductory impulse, representing the sympathetic chord\r\nof transmission, say B flat, or any other chord, be given to\r\na sectional transmitting wire, the molecular triple, that is\r\ncarried sympathetically along the path of such transmitter by the\r\ndifferentiation induced, excites high sympathy with the polar\r\nterrestrial stream. The polar terrestrial, being triune in its\r\ncharacter, requires a triune sympathizer to meet its differential\r\nrequirements: silver the harmonic, gold the enharmonic, and platina the\r\ndominant. When this triple metallic condition is properly sensitized,\r\nby any chord on the dominant, combined molecular, differentiated\r\naction is induced; showing a condition approaching magnetism in\r\nits development of related sympathy, without having the conditions\r\nthat are truly magnetic, as this term (magnetic) is understood by\r\nall physicists.\r\n\r\nMagnetism is not polar negative attraction, any more than polar\r\nnegative attraction is magnetism; for polar negative attraction shows\r\npositive sympathetic outreach, of a high order; which is a condition\r\nentirely foreign to magnetism.\r\n\r\nSympathetic negative attraction is not the resultant of electrical\r\nsympathization, but it includes the full triune flow; the dominant\r\nbeing the leader and associate of the celestial. The sympathetic\r\noutreach, of negative attraction, is the power that holds the planetary\r\nmasses in their orbital ranges of oscillatory action. Magnetism has\r\nno outreach, but it pervades all terrestrial masses--all planetary\r\nmasses. It is highly electrical in its character, in fact magnetism is\r\nborn of electricity; whereas negative attraction is not, but it has a\r\nsympathetic outreach for magnetism. Magnetism is static. Sympathetic\r\nnegative attraction reaches from planet to planet; but electricity\r\ndoes not, nor does magnetism. Sympathetic negative attraction is born\r\nof the celestial, and impregnates every mass that floats in space:\r\nseeking out all magnetic or electric conditions; and all these masses\r\nare subservient to celestial outreach. All the magnets in the world\r\ncould not induce rotation, no matter how differentiated, but polar\r\nnegative attraction induces rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe horizon of matter, which has been thought to rest over attenuated\r\nhydrogen, may extend to infinite reaches beyond, including stuffs\r\nor substances which have never been revealed to the senses. Beings\r\nfashioned of this attenuated substance might walk by our side unseen,\r\nnor cast a shadow in the noon-day sun.--Hudson Tuttle.\r\n\r\nThis supposition of itself admits that hydrogen is a compound. If\r\nit were indivisible it would assimilate with the high luminous,\r\nfrom which all substances are formed or aggregated. If hydrogen were\r\na simple it could not be confined. No molecular structure known to\r\nman can hold the inter-luminous; not even the low order of it that\r\nis chemically liberated. The word \"attenuated\" admits that hydrogen\r\nis a compound. I contend that hydrogen is composed of three elements,\r\nwith a metallic base, and comes under the order of the second atomic,\r\nboth in vibration and sympathetic outreach.\r\n\r\nHydrogen exists only where planetary conditions exist: there it\r\nis always present, but never in uninterfered space. There is much\r\ncelestial material that has never been revealed to the senses. My\r\nresearches lead me to think that hydrogen carries heat in a latent\r\ncondition, but I do not believe it will ever be possible to originate\r\na device that will vibrate hydrogen with a velocity to induce heat.\r\n\r\nThe word imponderable as applied to a molecule is incorrect. All gases\r\nas well as atmospheric air are molecular in their structures. If\r\natmospheric air is subdivided, by atomic vibration, it merely\r\ndissociates the hydrogen from the oxygen; neither of which, though\r\ndisunited, passes from the inter-molecular state; and not until\r\nhydrogen is sympathetically subdivided in its inter-molecular structure\r\nby inter-atomic vibrations can it assimilate with the introductory\r\netheric element. There is a wonderful variation of gravital sympathy\r\nbetween the gaseous elements of compounds, all of which comes under\r\nthe head of molecular....\r\n\r\nUnder date of October 1st, 1891, Mr. Keely writes: I see no possibility\r\nof failure, as I have demonstrated that my theories are correct in\r\nevery particular, as far as I have gone; and if I am not handicapped in\r\nany way during the next eight months, and my depolarizer is perfect,\r\nI will then be prepared to demonstrate the truth of all that I assert\r\nin reference to disintegration, cerebral diagnosis, aerial suspension\r\nand dissociation, and to prove the celestial gravital link of sympathy\r\nas existing between the polar terrestrial and equation of mental\r\ndisturbance of equilibrium. It is a broad assertion for one man, and\r\n'an ignorant man' at that, to make; but the proof will then be so\r\noverwhelming in its truthful simplicity that the most simple-minded\r\ncan understand it. Then I will be prepared to give to science and to\r\ncommerce a system that will elevate both to a position far above that\r\nwhich they now occupy.\r\n\r\nAgain, November 4th, Mr. Keely says: The proper system for the\r\ntreatment of cerebral differentiation is not yet known to the\r\nphysician of to-day. The dissimilarities of opinion existing,\r\nwith regard to any case, are confounding. When the true system\r\nis recognized, the vast number of physical experimentalists, now\r\ntorturing humanity, will die a natural death. Until this climax is\r\nreached, physical suffering must go on multiplying at the same ratio\r\nthat experimentalists increase. Molecular differentiation is the fiend\r\nthat wrecks the physical world, using the seat of the cerebral forces\r\nas its intermediate transmitter. It is the devastating dragon of the\r\nuniverse, and will continue to devastate until a St. George arises\r\nto destroy it. The system of equating molecular differentiation is\r\nthe St. George that will conquer.\r\n\r\nWhen my system is completed for commerce, it will be ready for science\r\nand art. I have become an extensive night worker, giving not less\r\nthan eighteen hours a day, in times of intensification. I have timed\r\nmy race for life and I am bound to make it....\r\n\r\nNew York Truth, 15th May, 1890, in commenting upon Keely's claims to\r\nhave \"annihilated gravity and turned the mysterious polar current\r\nto a mill-race,\" continues: \"I sincerely hope that Mr. Keely may\r\nprove, AS FROM LATE DEVELOPMENTS HE IS LIKE TO DO, that the hidden\r\nspirit of the Cosmos, which men call Deity, First Cause, Nature,\r\nand other sonorous but indefinite names, has manifested itself to\r\nhim; that the music of the spheres is a truth, not an imagination,\r\nand that vibration, which is sight, hearing, taste and smell, is in\r\nserious verity, all else. The fable of Orpheus and Arion may have\r\na foundation in actual physics, the harmonies that move our souls\r\nto grief or joy as music, may be the same as those that govern and\r\nimpel the stars in their courses, cause molecules to crystallize\r\ninto symmetry, and from symmetry into life. Who shall say? If the\r\naccounts of Keely's late achievements be true, and they are honestly\r\nvouched for by men of worth and note, then the secret is laid bare,\r\nthe core of being is opened out. In this age of dawning reason the\r\ncandle cannot always be hidden under a bushel; some enterprising hand\r\nwill lift the obstruction and let the light shine before men.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years have nearly passed away since this was written, during\r\nwhich time Mr. Keely has been engaged in perfecting his system for\r\naerial navigation. He has, one by one, overcome all obstacles, and\r\nso far gained control, of the mysterious polar current, that he has\r\nbeen able to exhibit on the thirds, or molecular graduation of the\r\npropeller of his air-ship, 120 revolutions in a minute; and on the\r\nsixths, or atomic graduation, 360 revolutions in a minute. He still\r\nhas the etheric field to conquer; but those who know how many years he\r\nhas been making his mistakes stepping-stones in his upward progress,\r\nsurmounting obstacle after obstacle which would have dismayed a less\r\ncourageous soul, feel little doubt that he will \"make the race,\" which\r\nhe has timed for life, and reach the goal a conqueror, notwithstanding\r\nhe is still so often \"handicapped.\"\r\n\r\nAll those who had the privilege of witnessing Keely's researching\r\nexperiments, in the spring of 1890, when he first succeeded in raising\r\nthe metal weight, and who were sufficiently acquainted with the\r\nlaws of physics to understand the conditions under which the weight\r\nwas raised, pronounced the force by which it was affected to be an\r\nunknown force. Had the weight been but a nail or a feather, lifted\r\nunder such conditions, physicists know that, after he has gained as\r\nperfect control of it as we now have of steam, air-ships weighing\r\nthousands of tons can be raised to any height in our atmosphere,\r\nand the seemingly untraversable highways of the air opened to commerce.\r\n\r\nThis force is not, like steam or electricity, fraught with danger\r\nin certain states to those who use it; for, after the molecular\r\nmass of the vessel has been fitted to the conditions required,\r\nits control becomes of such a nature that seemingly a star might as\r\nsoon go astray, and be lost to the universe, as for the aerial ship\r\nto meet with an accident, unless its speed was pushed to that point\r\nwhere gravity resumes its control. In fact, Keely asserts that there\r\nis no known force so safe to use as the polar terrestrial force,\r\nfor when the celestial and terrestrial conditions are once set up,\r\nthey remain for ever; perpetual molecular action the result.\r\n\r\nIn using the word celestial, Keely refers to the air, in the same\r\nsense that terrestrial refers to the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Wide through the waste of ether, sun and star\r\n          All linked by harmony, which is the chain\r\n        That binds to earth the orbs that wheel afar\r\n          Through the blue fields of Nature's wide domain.\r\n\r\n                                                    Percival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Home Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE SONG OF THE CARBONS.

Lord Salisbury\r\nreminded his hearers that about one hundred years ago, a very\r\ncelebrated tribunal had informed Lavoisier that the French Republic\r\nhad no need of chemists; \"but,\" said his Lordship, \"Lavoisier,\r\nthough a man of very advanced opinions, was behind this age.\" Lord\r\nSalisbury proceeded to exalt chemistry as an instrument of the higher\r\neducational discipline. Astronomy, he said, was hardly more than a\r\nscience of things that probably are; for, at such distance in space,\r\nit was impossible to verify your inferences. Geology he regarded as a\r\nscience of things as they probably were; verification being impossible\r\nafter such a lapse of time. But chemistry he treated as a science\r\nof things as they actually are at the present time. The Spectator\r\nremarks:--Surely that is questionable. All hypothesis is more or less a\r\nmatter of probability. No one has ever verified the existence of atoms.\r\n\r\nSir Lyon Playfair, following Lord Salisbury, said, Boyle has been\r\ncalled the father of chemistry and the brother of the Earl of Cork;\r\nironically hinting, perhaps, that Lord Salisbury was reflecting as\r\nmuch immediate glory on chemistry, by his interest in it, as did the\r\nrelationship of the first considerable chemist to the Irish earl. Sir\r\nLyon, acknowledging the revolutionizing progress of chemistry,\r\nremarked that within the last fifty years it had seen great changes;\r\nthen, oxygen was regarded as the universal lover of other elements;\r\nand nitrogen was looked upon as a quiet, confirmed bachelor; but\r\noxygen had turned out to be a comparatively respectable bigamist, that\r\nonly marries two wives at a time; and nitrogen had turned out to be a\r\npolygamist; generally requiring three conjugates, and sometimes five,\r\nat a time. The false teachings of physicists in the past were admitted,\r\nincluding Sir Lyon's own errors; his old conceptions concerning\r\ncarbonic acid and carbonic oxide all having broken down, under the\r\ncrushing feet of progress. After all, says the Spectator, it seems\r\nthat the French revolutionists should have welcomed chemistry, instead\r\nof snubbing it, for it has been the most revolutionary of sciences.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, notwithstanding the experiences of the past,\r\nScience stands as calmly on the pedestal, to which she has exalted\r\nherself, as if not even an earthquake could rock its foundations. In\r\nher own opinion, she holds the key to nature's domains. Some few there\r\nare who are ready to admit that it is possible Nature still holds the\r\nkey herself; and who are not unwilling to encounter another revolution,\r\nif they can extend their knowledge of Nature's laws; even though it\r\nmay leave only ruins, where now all is supposed to be so solid as to\r\ndefy earthquakes and other revolutionizing forces.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of the onward march of chemistry in the\r\npast, we find that Robert Boyle, who lived from 1627 to 1691, was\r\nthe first chemist who grasped the idea of the distinctions between\r\nan elementary and a compound body. He has been called the first\r\nscientific chemist, and he certainly did much to advance chemical\r\nscience, particularly in the borderland of chemistry and physics,\r\nbut he did this more by his overthrow of false theories, than in any\r\nother way. It was left for Scheele (born 1742), an obscure Swedish\r\nchemist whose discoveries extended over the whole range of chemical\r\nscience, and his French contemporary, Lavoisier (born 1743), to\r\nbring about a complete revolution in chemistry. Thus, step by step,\r\nand period by period, experimental science has prepared the way to\r\nreach that elevation which humanity is destined eventually to attain,\r\nwhen all errors have been discarded and truth reigns triumphant. The\r\nquestion has been asked, in view of the past history of discovery,\r\nwhat may not the science of the future accomplish in the unseen\r\npathways of the air? That still unconquered field lies before us,\r\nand we know that it is only a question of time when man will hold\r\ndominion there with as firm sway as he now holds it on land and sea.\r\n\r\nPhysics and chemistry walk hand in hand. Scientists cannot cut the tie\r\nthat joins them together in experimental science. Physics treats of\r\nthe changes of matter without regard to its internal constitution. The\r\nlaws of gravitation and cohesion belong to physical science. They\r\nconcern matter without reference to its composition. Chemistry makes\r\nus acquainted with the constituents of the different forms of matter,\r\ntheir proportions and the changes which they are capable of bringing\r\nabout in each other. But notwithstanding the lessons of the past, both\r\nchemistry and physics are blind to what the future has in store for\r\nthem. Scientists have erected barriers to progress, building them so\r\nas to appear of solid masonry on the ground of false hypotheses; but,\r\nwhen the hour is ripe, these will be swept away as if by a cyclone,\r\nleaving not one stone on another. It was Boyle who overthrew the\r\nso-called Aristotelian doctrine, and Paracelsus's teachings of the\r\nthree constitutents of matter, disputed first by Van Helmont. Boyle\r\ntaught that chemical combination consists of an approximation of the\r\nsmallest particles of matter, and that a decomposition takes place when\r\na third body is present, capable of exerting on the particles of the\r\none element a greater attraction than is exercised by the particles\r\nof the element with which it is combined. In this conjecture there is\r\njust a hint of the grand potentialities in the unknown realm which is\r\nnow being explored by Keely, the discoverer of the order of vibration\r\nthat releases the latent force held in the interstitial spaces of the\r\nconstituents of water; one order of vibration, being more in sympathy\r\nwith one of the elements of water than with the other, possesses a\r\ngreater attraction for that element and thereby raptures its atoms,\r\nshowing up new elements. Not all men of science are willing to admit\r\nthe atomic theory; although it explains satisfactorily all the known\r\nlaws of chemical combination. Dalton, accepting the teachings of\r\nthe ancients as to the atomic constitution of matter, was the first\r\nto propound a truly chemical atomic theory; a quantitative theory,\r\ndeclaring that the atoms of the different elements are not of the same\r\nweight, and that the relative atomic weights of the elements are the\r\nproportions, by weight, in which the elements combine. All previous\r\ntheories, or suggestions, had been simply qualitative. Berzelius,\r\nthe renowned Swedish chemist, advancing Dalton's atomic theory, laid\r\nthe foundation stones of chemical science, as it now exists. Since\r\nhis day, by the new methods of spectrum analysis, elements unknown\r\nbefore have been discovered; and researchers in this field are\r\nnow boldly questioning whether all the supposed elements are really\r\nundecomposable substances, and are conjecturing that they are not. On\r\nthis subject Sir Henry Roscoe says:--\r\n\r\n\"So far as our chemical knowledge enables us to judge, we may assume,\r\nwith a considerable degree of probability, that by the application\r\nof more powerful means than are known at present, chemists will\r\nsucceed in obtaining still more simple bodies from the so-called\r\nelements. Indeed, if we examine the history of our science, we find\r\nfrequent examples occurring of bodies, that only a short time ago were\r\nconsidered to be elementary, which have been shown to be compounds,\r\nupon more careful examination.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the chemist's retort has failed to accomplish has been effected\r\nby the discoverer of latent force existing in all forms of matter,\r\nwhere it is held locked in the interstitial spaces, until released\r\nby a certain order of vibration. As yet, the order of vibration which\r\nreleases this force, has not been discovered in any forms of matter,\r\nexcepting in the constituents of gunpowder, dynamite, and water. The\r\nChinese are supposed to have invented, centuries before the birth of\r\nChrist, the explosive compound gunpowder, which requires that order of\r\nvibration known as heat to bring about a rupture of the molecules of\r\nthe nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, of which it is composed. Dynamite\r\nrequires another order of vibration--concussion--to release the\r\nlatent force held in the molecular embrace of its constituents. The\r\norder of vibration discovered by Keely, which causes the rupture\r\nof the molecular and atomic capsules of the constituents of water,\r\nmust remain--though in one point only--a secret with the discoverer,\r\nuntil he has completed his system for science, and some one patentable\r\ninvention. Let physicists be incredulous or cautious, it matters not\r\nto him. He has proved to his own satisfaction the actual existence of\r\natoms and their divisibility--and, to the satisfaction of thousands\r\ncapable of forming an opinion, the existence of an unknown force. Men\r\nof science have not been in any haste to aid him, either with money\r\nor with sympathy, in his researches; and he will take his own time\r\nto bestow upon them the fruit of those researches.\r\n\r\nThose who have not clear ideas as to the nature of elementary\r\nbodies--molecules and atoms--may like to know that elements are\r\ndefined as simple substances, out of which no other two or more\r\nessentially differing substances have been obtained. Compounds are\r\nbodies out of which two or more essentially differing substances have\r\nbeen obtained. A molecule is the smallest part of a compound or element\r\nthat is capable of existence in a free state. Atoms are set down, by\r\nthose who believe in the atomic theory, as the indivisible constituents\r\nof molecules. Thus, an element is a substance made up of atoms of the\r\nsame kind; a compound is a substance made up of atoms of unlike kind.\r\n\r\nOver seventy elements are now known, out of which, or compounds of\r\nthese with each other, our globe is composed, and also the meteoric\r\nstones which have fallen on our earth. The science of chemistry aims at\r\nthe experimental examination of the elements and their compounds, and\r\nthe investigation of the laws which regulate their combination one with\r\nanother. For example, in the year 1805, Gay-Lussac and Von Humboldt\r\nfound that one volume of oxygen combines with exactly two volumes of\r\nhydrogen to form water, and that these exact proportions hold good\r\nat whatever temperature the gases are brought into contact. Oxygen\r\nand hydrogen are now classified as elementary bodies.\r\n\r\nThe existence of atoms, if proved, as claimed by the pioneer of whom\r\nwe write, confirms Priestly's idea that all discoveries are made\r\nby chance; for it certainly was by a mere chance, as we view things\r\nwith our limited knowledge, that Keely stumbled over the dissociation\r\nof the supposed simple elements of water by vibratory force; [23]\r\nthus making good Roscoe's assumption that, by the application of more\r\npowerful means than were known to him, still more simple bodies would\r\nbe shown up. Had Keely subdivided these corpuscles of matter, after a\r\nmethod known to physicists, he would have been hailed as a discoverer,\r\nwhen it was announced by Arthur Goddard, in the British Mercantile\r\nGazette, in 1887, that Keely declared electricity to be a certain\r\nform of atomic vibration of what is called the luminiferous ether.\r\n\r\nHad Keely been better understood, science might have been marching\r\nwith giant strides across this unknown realm during the many years\r\nin which men of learning have refused to witness the operation of the\r\ndissociation of water, because one of their number decided, in 1876,\r\nthat Keely was using compressed air. Fixing bounds to human knowledge,\r\nshe still refuses to listen to the suggestion that what she has\r\ndeclared as truth may be as grossly erroneous as were her teachings\r\nin the days when the rotation of the earth was denied; this denial\r\nbeing based upon the assertions of all the great authorities of more\r\nthan one thousand years, that the earth could not move because it was\r\nflat and stationary. Herodotus ridiculed those who did not believe\r\nthis. For two thousand years after the daily rotation of the earth\r\nwas first suggested, the idea was disputed and derided. The history\r\nof the past, says General Drayson, who claims to have discovered\r\na third movement of the earth, teaches us that erroneous theories\r\nwere accepted as grand truths by all the scientific authorities of\r\nthe whole world during more than five thousand years. [24] Although\r\nthe daily rotation of the earth and its annual revolution around\r\nthe sun had been received as facts by the few advanced minds, some\r\nfive hundred years before Christ, yet the obstructions caused by\r\nignorance and prejudice prevented these truths from being generally\r\naccepted until about three hundred years ago, when Copernicus first,\r\nand afterwards Galileo, revived the theory of the earth's two principal\r\nmovements. Human nature is the same as in the days when Seneca said\r\nthat men would rather cling to an error than admit they were in the\r\nwrong; so it is not strange that General Drayson, as the discoverer\r\nof a third movement, has not received the attention that he deserves,\r\nalthough his mathematical demonstrations seem to be beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nWith Keely's claim, that latent force exists in all forms of matter,\r\nit is different; for it is susceptible of proof by experiment. In the\r\ndays when the sphericity of the earth was denied, for the asserted\r\nreason that the waters of the oceans and seas on its surface would\r\nbe thrown off in its revolutions were it so, because water could\r\nnot stay on a round ball, the statement could not be disputed; the\r\ntheory of the laws of gravitation being then unknown. Copernicus\r\nand Galileo had nothing but theories to offer; consequently it took\r\nlong years to overcome the bigotry and the baneful influence of\r\nthe great authorities of the time. It is otherwise with Keely, who,\r\nfor fifteen years and more, has been demonstrating this discovery to\r\nthousands of men; some of whom, but not all, were competent to form\r\nan opinion as to whether he was \"humbugging with compressed air,\"\r\nor with a concealed dynamo, or, still more absurd, with tricks in\r\nsuction, as I asserted by a learned professor.\r\n\r\nNow that some of our men of science have consented to form their\r\nopinions from observation, without interfering with the lines of\r\nprogressive experimental research which the discoverer is pursuing,\r\nthere seems to be no doubt as to the result; nor of the protection\r\nof the discovery by science. Truth is mighty, and must in the end\r\nprevail over mere authority.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that we need nothing more than the history of\r\nastronomy to teach us how obstinately the strongholds of error are\r\nclung to by incompetent reasoners; but when a stronghold is demolished,\r\nthere is nothing left to cling to. Sir John Lubbock says:--The great\r\nlesson which science teaches is how little we yet know, and how much\r\nwe have still to learn. To which it might be added, and how much we\r\nhave to unlearn!\r\n\r\nAll mysteries are said to be either truths concealing deeper truths,\r\nor errors concealing deeper errors; and thus, as the mysteries\r\nunfold, truth or error will show itself in a gradually clearer light,\r\nenabling us to distinguish between the two. It is now left for men\r\nof science to decide as to the nature of the mysteries which Keely\r\nis slowly unfolding, and whether his demonstrations substantiate his\r\ntheories. They have been invited to follow him in his experimental\r\nresearch, step by step; to bestow upon him sympathy and encouragement,\r\nso long withheld, until he reaches that stage where he will no longer\r\nneed their protection. Then, if science is satisfied that he has gained\r\na treasure for her, in his years of dead-work, she must step aside\r\nand wait patiently until he has fulfilled his obligations to those\r\nwho organized themselves into a company to aid him, long before she\r\ncame forward to interest herself in his behalf. Those men of science\r\nwho have refused to countenance this great work, even by witnessing\r\nexperiments made to prove the discovery of an unknown force, are\r\nmen who attempt no explanation of the miracles of nature by which\r\nwe are surrounded, assuming that no explanation can be given; but,\r\nas Bacon has said, he is a bad mariner, who concludes, when all is\r\nsea around him, that there is no land beyond.\r\n\r\nIf the multitude of so-called laws of nature could be resolved into\r\none grand universal law, would it not be considered a great step\r\nin the progress of scientific knowledge? This is what our pioneer\r\nclaims for his discoveries, one law working throughout nature, in all\r\nthings; for, as Macvicar says, the productive and conservative agency\r\nin creation, as it exists and acts, does not consist of two things,\r\n\"idea\" and \"power\"; but of a unity embracing both, for which there is\r\nno special name. The relation between the Creator and the Creation,\r\nthe First Cause and what he has effected, is altogether inscrutable;\r\nbut intelligence acting analytically, as it cannot be kept from doing,\r\ninsists on these two elements in the problem, viz. idea and power.\r\n\r\n\"The law of the universe is a distinct dualism while the creative\r\nenergies are at work; and of a compound union when at rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that motion can only be effected mechanically,\r\nby pressure or traction or contact of some kind, is an utterly\r\nhelpless one to explain even familiar movements. Gravitation itself,\r\nthe grandest and most prevailing phenomenon of the material universe,\r\nhas set all genius at defiance when attempting to conceive a mechanism\r\nwhich might account for it. The law of sympathetic association, or\r\nsympathetic assimilation, between two or more atoms, or masses of\r\natoms, explains this grand phenomenon; but Roscoe, in theorizing on\r\nthe atomic theory, says that from purely chemical considerations it\r\nappears unlikely the existence of atoms will ever be proved. It never\r\ncould have been proved by mechanical physics nor by chemistry. The law\r\nwhich locks the atoms together would have remained an unknown law,\r\nhad not Keely opened the door leading into one of nature's domains\r\nwhich was never entered before, unless by the fabled Orpheus, who,\r\nmythology tells us, was killed because he revealed to man what the\r\ngods wished to conceal. Certainly, whether Orpheus ever existed or\r\nnot, the principle which Pythagoras promulgated as the teaching of\r\nOrpheus is disclosed in one of Keely's discoveries.\r\n\r\nIn the great fresco of the school of Athens, by Raphael, Pythagoras\r\nis represented as explaining to his pupils his theory that the same\r\nprinciple underlies the harmonies of music and the motion of heavenly\r\nbodies. One of these pupils holds in his hand a tablet, shaped like a\r\nzither, on which are inscribed the Greek words, Diapason, Diapente,\r\nDiatessaron. Of the diapason, or concord of all, Spenser writes,\r\nin The Faerie Queen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Nine was the circle set in heaven's place,\r\n        All which compacted made a goodly diapase.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we have a clue to the Thirds, Sixths and Ninths of Keely's\r\ntheories, in the operation of his polar negative attractor. The\r\nconception of the Pythagoreans of music, as the principle of the\r\ncreation's order, and the mainstay and supporter of the material world,\r\nis strictly in accordance with the marvellous truths which are now\r\nbeing unfolded to science. Rightly divined Browning when he wrote of\r\n\r\n\r\n            ... music's mystery, which mind fails\r\n        To fathom; its solution no mere clue;\r\n\r\n\r\nand Cardinal Newman also, when he discoursed of musical sounds,\r\n\"under which great wonders unknown to us seem to have been typified,\"\r\nas \"the living law of divine government.\" Since the days of Leucippus,\r\npoets and philosophers have often touched upon the mysteries hidden in\r\nsound, which are now being revealed in the experimental researches of\r\nKeely. These truths make no impression on those who are not gifted\r\nwith any comprehension of nature's harmonious workings, and are\r\nregarded as flights of fancy and of rhetoric. Among the utterances of\r\ninspiration--and all truth is inspired--one of the most remarkable,\r\nwhen taken in connection with these discoveries, is found in these\r\neloquent words of the Dean of Boston University in his \"Review of\r\nHerbert Spencer,\" printed in 1876:--\r\n\r\n\"Think of the universal warring of tremendous forces which is for\r\never going on, and remember that out of this strife is born, not\r\nchaos void and formless, but a creation of law and harmony. Bear\r\nin mind, too, that this creation is filled with the most marvellous\r\nmechanisms, with the most exquisite contrivances, and with forms of\r\nthe rarest beauty. Remember, also, that the existence of these forms\r\nfor even a minute depends upon the nicest balance of destructive\r\nforces. Abysses of chaos yawn on every side, and yet creation holds\r\non its way. Nature's keys need but to be jarred to turn the tune into\r\nunutterable discord, and yet the harmony is preserved. Bring hither\r\nyour glasses--and see that, from atomic recess to the farthest depth,\r\nthere is naught but 'toil co-operant to an end.' All these atoms move\r\nto music; all march in tune. Listen until you catch the strain, and\r\nthen say whether it is credible that a blind force should originate\r\nand maintain all this.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel said:--There is some principle in the science of\r\nmusic that has yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\nIt is this principle which has been discovered by Keely. Let his\r\ntheories be disputed as they have been, and as they still may be,\r\nthe time has come in which his supporters claim that he is able to\r\ndemonstrate what he teaches; is able to show how superficial are\r\nthe foundations of the strongholds to which physicists are clinging;\r\nand able to prove purity of conditions in physical science which not\r\neven the philosophers and poets of the past have so much as dreamed\r\nof in their hours of inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ... ways are made,\r\n        Burdens are lifted, or are laid,\r\n        By some great law unseen and still,\r\n        Unfathomed purpose to fulfil.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur materialistic physicists, our Comtist and agnostic philosophers,\r\nhave done their best to destroy our faith.\r\n\r\nOf him who will not believe in Soul because his scalpel cannot detect\r\nit, Browning wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    To know of, think about--\r\n        Is all man's sum of faculty effects,\r\n        When exercised on earth's least atom.\r\n        What was, what is, what may such atoms be?--\r\n        Unthinkable, unknowable to man.\r\n        Yet, since to think and know fire through and through\r\n        Exceeds man, is the warmth of fire unknown?\r\n        Its uses--are they so unthinkable?\r\n        Pass from such obvious power to powers unseen,\r\n        Undreamed of save in their sure consequence:\r\n        Take that we spoke of late, which draws to ground\r\n        The staff my hand lets fall; it draws at least--\r\n        Thus much man thinks and knows, if nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese lines were written in reference to Keely's discovery of the\r\ninfinite subdivision of the atom; for not until a much later period was\r\nBrowning influenced by a New York journalist to look upon Keely as \"a\r\nmodern Cagliostro.\" Keely's discovery was the key-note of \"Ferishtah's\r\nFancies,\" written by Browning before he met this journalist.\r\n\r\nProfessor Koenig writes:--I have long given up the idea of\r\nunderstanding the Universe; with a little insight into its microcosm,\r\nI would feel quite satisfied; as every day it becomes more puzzling.\r\n\r\nBut there are no boundaries set to knowledge in the life of the Soul,\r\nand these discoveries reach out so far towards the Infinite, that\r\nwe are led by them to realize how much there is left for science to\r\nexplore in the supposed unfathomable depths of the etheric domain,\r\nwhence proceeds the influence that connects us with that infinite\r\nand eternal energy from which all things proceed.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of willingness to receive truths, of whatever\r\nnature, now manifested by men of science in regard to Keely's\r\nexperimental research, is shared by all who are not \"wise in their\r\nown conceit.\" They stand ready to welcome, while waiting for proof,\r\nthe discovery of Darwin's grand-niece, Mrs. F. J. Hughes, as now\r\ndemonstrated by Keely, viz., that the laws which develop and control\r\nharmonies, develop and control the universe; and they will rejoice\r\nto be convinced (as Keely teaches) that all corpuscular aggregation\r\nabsorbs energy, holding it latent in its embrace until liberated by a\r\ncertain order of vibration; that nature does not aggregate one form\r\nof matter under one law, and another form of matter under another\r\nlaw. When this has been demonstrated, to their entire satisfaction,\r\nthey will acknowledge that Faraday's speculations on the nature\r\nof force and matter pointed the way to Keely's discoveries. Some\r\nbroad-minded men have been pursuing lines of research which give\r\nevidence of their desire to solve the problem for themselves as\r\nto the mode of rupturing the atom, which science declares to be\r\nindivisible. Before any great scientific principle receives distinct\r\nenunciation, says Tyndall, it has dwelt more or less clearly in many\r\nminds. The intellectual plateau is already high, and our discoverers\r\nare those who, like peaks above the plateau, rise over the general\r\nlevel of thought at the time. If, as Browning has said,\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Tis not what man does which exalts him, but what man would do,\r\n\r\n\r\nsurely this discoverer merits the sympathy and the admiration of\r\nall men, whether he succeeds commercially or not, for his persistent\r\nefforts to make his discoveries of use to the world. Keely has always\r\nsaid that scientists would never be able to understand his discoveries\r\nuntil he had reached some practical or commercial result. Only now he\r\nsees an interest awakened among men of science, which is as gratifying\r\nto him as it is unexpected. For the first time in his life, he is\r\nworking with the appreciation of men competent to comprehend what\r\nhe has done in the past, and what remains to be done in the future,\r\nwithout one aspiration on their part for monetary results.\r\n\r\nForemost among these men was the late Joseph Leidy, Professor of\r\nBiology in the University of Pennsylvania; but physicists were not\r\nsatisfied to take the opinion of this great man, because he was a\r\nbiologist. What better preparation than the study of the science of\r\nlife could a man have to qualify him for discriminating between laws\r\nof nature as conjectured by physicists, and Nature's operations as\r\ndemonstrated by Keely?\r\n\r\nTo such men, possessing entire scientific and intellectual liberty of\r\nthought, with that love of justice and truth which keeps its possessor\r\nfrom self-conceit, arrogance and intolerance, the world owes all\r\nthat we now possess of scientific advance, since the days when men\r\nbelieved the thunder and lightning to be the artillery of the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucifer, September, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nLATENT FORCE IN INTERSTITIAL SPACES--ELECTRO-MAGNETIC\r\nRADIATION--MOLECULAR DISSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n(By John Ernst Worrell Keely.)\r\n\r\n        The atom is infinitely divisible.--Arthur Schopenhauer.\r\n\r\n        For thou well knowest that the imbecility of our understanding,\r\n        in not comprehending the more abstruse and retired causes of\r\n        things, is not to be ascribed to any defect in their nature,\r\n        but in our own hoodwinkt intellect.--P. 6, A Ternary of\r\n        Paradoxes.--Van Helmont.\r\n\r\n        The advance of science, which for a time overshadowed\r\n        philosophy, has brought men face to face once more with\r\n        ultimate questions, and has revealed the impotence of science\r\n        to deal with its own conditions and pre-suppositions. The needs\r\n        of science itself call for a critical doctrine of knowledge\r\n        as the basis of an ultimate theory of things. Philosophy\r\n        must criticize not only the categories of science but also\r\n        the metaphysical systems of the past.--Prof. Seth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLatent Force.\r\n\r\nScience, even in its highest progressive conditions, cannot assert\r\nanything definite. The many mistakes that men of science have\r\nmade in the past prove the fallacy of asserting. By doing so they\r\nbastardize true philosophy and, as it were, place the wisdom of God\r\nat variance; as in the assertion that latent power does not exist\r\nin corpuscular aggregations of matter, in all its different forms,\r\nvisible or invisible.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, gunpowder, which is composed of three different\r\nmediums of aggregated matter, saltpetre, charcoal, and sulphur,\r\neach representing different orders of molecular density which,\r\nwhen associated under proper conditions, gives what is called an\r\nexplosive compound. In fact it is a mass which is made susceptible\r\nat any moment by its exciter fire, which is an order of vibration,\r\nto evolve a most wonderful energy in volume many thousands of times\r\ngreater than the volume it represents in its molecular mass. If it be\r\nnot latent force that is thus liberated by its exciter, a mere spark,\r\nwhat is it? Are not the gases that are evolved in such great volume and\r\npower held latent in the molecular embrace of its aggregated matter,\r\nbefore being excited into action? If this force is not compressed\r\nthere, nor placed there by absorption, how did it get there? And by\r\nwhat power was it held in its quiescent state? I contend that it was\r\nplaced there at the birth of the molecule by the law of sympathetic\r\netheric focalization towards the negative centres of neutrality with a\r\nvelocity as inconceivable in its character as would be the subdivision\r\nof matter to an ultimate end. Again, what is the energy that is held\r\nin the molecular embrace of that small portion of dynamite which by\r\nslight concussion, another order of vibration, evolves volumes of\r\nterrific force, riving the solid rock and hurling massive projectiles\r\nfor miles? If it is not latent power that is excited into action, what\r\nis it? Finally, what is held in the interstitial corpuscular embrace\r\nof water, which by its proper exciter another form of vibration,\r\nis liberated showing almost immeasurable volume and power? Is not\r\nthis energy latent, quiet, until brought forth by its sympathetic\r\nnegative exciter? Could the force thus evolved from these different\r\nsubstances be confined again, or pressed back and absorbed into the\r\ninterstitial spaces occupied before liberation, where the sympathetic\r\nnegative power of the Infinite One originally placed it? [25]\r\n\r\nIf latent force is not accumulated and held in corpuscular aggregations\r\nhow is it that progressive orders of disintegration of water induce\r\nprogressive conditions of increased volume and of higher power? I\r\nhold that in the evolved gases of all explosive compounds, dynamite\r\nor any other, there exists deeper down in the corpuscular embrace of\r\nthe gaseous element, induced by the first explosion, a still greater\r\ndegree of latent energy that could be awakened by the proper condition\r\nof vibration; and still further on ad infinitum. [26]\r\n\r\nIs it possible to imagine that mere molecular dissociation could show\r\nup such immense volumes of energy, unassociated with the medium of\r\nlatent force?\r\n\r\nThe question arises, How is this sympathetic power held in the\r\ninterstitial corpuscular condition?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--By the incalculable velocity of the molecular and atomic\r\netheric capsules, [27] which velocity represents billions of\r\nrevolutions per second in their rotations. We shall imagine a sphere\r\nof twelve inches in diameter, representing a magnified molecule\r\nsurrounded by an atmospheric envelope of one sixteenth of an inch\r\nin depth; the envelope rotating at a velocity of the same increased\r\nratio of the molecule's magnification. At the very lowest estimate\r\nit would give a velocity of six hundred thousand miles per second,\r\nor twenty-four thousand times the circumference of the earth in\r\nthat time. Is it possible to compute what the velocity would be,\r\non the same ratio, up to the earth's diameter?[#2] It is only under\r\nsuch illustrations that we can be brought even to faintly imagine the\r\nwonderful sympathetic activity that exists in the molecular realm. An\r\natmospheric film, rotating on a twelve inch sphere at the same ratio as\r\nthe molecular one, would be impenetrable to a steel-pointed projectile\r\nat its greatest velocity; and would hermetically enclose a resisting\r\npressure of many thousands of pounds per square inch. The latent force\r\nevolved in the disintegration of water proves this fact; for under\r\netheric evolution, in progressive orders of vibration, these pressures\r\nare evolved, and show their energy on a lever especially constructed\r\nfor the purpose, strong enough for measuring a force over three times\r\nthat of gunpowder. We shall continue this subject a little farther,\r\nand this little farther will reach out into infinity. The speculations\r\nof the physicists of the present age, in regard to latent energy,\r\nwould neutralize the sympathetic conditions that are associated with\r\nthe governing force of the cerebral and the muscular organism. The\r\nevolution of a volition, the infinite exciter, arouses the latent\r\nenergy of the physical organism to do its work; differential orders\r\nof brain-force acting against each other under dual conditions. If\r\nthere were no latent energy to arouse sympathetically, there would\r\nbe no action in the physical frame; as all force is will-force.\r\n\r\nAll the evolutions of latent power in its varied multiplicity of action\r\ninduced by its proper exciters, prove the connecting link between\r\nthe celestial and the terrestrial, the finite and the infinite. (See\r\nAppendix I.)\r\n\r\nThere would be no life, and therefore no action in aggregated matter,\r\nhad the latent negative force been left out of it.\r\n\r\nIf a bar of steel or iron is brought into contact with a magnet, the\r\nlatent force that the steel or iron is impregnated with is aroused,\r\nand shows its interstitial latent action by still holding another\r\nbar. But this experiment does not give the most remote idea of the\r\nimmensity of the force that would show itself on more progressive\r\nexciters. Enough alternate active energy could be evolved, by the\r\nproper sympathetic exciter, in one cubic inch of steel to do the work\r\nof a horse, by its sympathetic association with the polar force in\r\nalternate polarization and depolarization.\r\n\r\nThis is the power that I am now getting under control (using the\r\nproper exciters as associated with the mechanical media) to do\r\ncommercial work. In other words, I am making a sympathetic harness\r\nfor the polar terrestrial force: first, by exciting the sympathetic\r\nconcordant force that exists in the corpuscular interstitial domain,\r\nwhich is concordant to it; and secondly, after the concordance is\r\nestablished, by negatizing the thirds, sixths, and ninths of this\r\nconcordance, thereby inducing high velocities with great power by\r\nintermittent negation, as associated with the dominant thirds.\r\n\r\nAgain: Take away the sympathetic latent force that all matter is\r\nimpregnated with, the connective link between the finite and the\r\ninfinite would be dissociated, and gravity would be neutralized;\r\nbringing all visible and invisible aggregations back into the great\r\netheric realm.\r\n\r\nHere let me ask, What does the term cohesion mean? What is the\r\npower that holds molecules together, but electro-magnetic negative\r\nattraction? What is the state that is brought about by certain\r\nconditions of sympathetic vibration, causing molecules to repel each\r\nother, but electro-magnetic radiation?\r\n\r\nIt must not be understood that the character of the action of the\r\nlatent force liberated from liquids and gases is the same, in its\r\nevolution, as that of the latent force existing in metals. The former\r\nshows up an elastic energy, which emanates from the breaking up of\r\ntheir rotating envelopes; increasing, at the same time, the range\r\nof their corpuscular action: thus giving, under confinement, elastic\r\nforces of an almost infinite character. By liberation from the tube\r\nit is confined in, it seeks its medium of concordant tenuity with a\r\nvelocity greater than that of light.\r\n\r\nIn metals, the latent force, as excited by the same sympathizer,\r\nextends its range of neutral sympathetic attraction without corpuscular\r\nrupture, and reaches out as it were to link itself with its harmonic\r\nsympathizer, as long as its exciter is kept in action. When its exciter\r\nis dissociated, its outreach nestles back again into the corpuscular\r\nembrace of the molecular mass that has been acted upon. [28]\r\n\r\nThis is the polar sympathetic harness, as between metallic mediums\r\nand the polar dominant current,--the leader of the triune stream of\r\nthe terrestrial flow. (See Appendix II.)\r\n\r\nThe velocity of the sympathetic bombarding streams, towards the centres\r\nof neutrality, in the corpuscular atoms, during sympathetic aggregation\r\nof visible molecular masses (in registering the latent force in their\r\ninterstitial spaces), is thousands of times greater than that of the\r\nmost sensitive explosives. An atmospheric stream of that velocity\r\nwould atomize the plate of an ironclad, if brought to bear on it.\r\n\r\nIf the evolution of the power of a volition be set down as one, what\r\nnumber would that represent in the power evolved by such volition on\r\nthe physical organism? To answer this we must first be able, mentally,\r\nto get down to the neutral central depths of the corpuscular atoms,\r\nwhere gravity ceases, to get its unit; and in the second place we\r\nmust be able to weigh it as against the force physically evolved.\r\n\r\nHow true, \"the finer the force the greater the power!\" and the\r\ngreater is the velocity, also; and the more mathematically infinite\r\nthe computation.\r\n\r\nYet all these conditions of evolution and concentration are\r\naccomplished by the celestial mind force, as associated with\r\nterrestrial brain matter.\r\n\r\nThe first seal is being broken, in the book of vibratory philosophy:\r\nthe first stepping-stone is placed toward reaching the solution of\r\nthat infinite problem,--the source of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory of Vibratory Lift for Air-Ships.\r\n\r\nAll molecular masses of terrestrial matter are composed of the\r\nultimate ether,--from which all things originally emanated. They\r\nare sympathetically drawn towards the earth's centre, as according\r\nto the density of their molecular aggregation, minus their force or\r\nsympathetic outreach towards celestial association. In other words,\r\nthe celestial flow as controlling terrestrial physical organisms.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic outflow from the celestial streams reaches the infinite\r\ndepths of all the diversified forms of matter. Thus it is seen that the\r\ncelestial flow which permeates, to its atomic depths, the terrestrial\r\nconvolutions of all matter, forms the exact sympathetic parallel to\r\nthe human brain-flow and the physical organism,--a perfect connective\r\nlink of controlling sympathy, or sympathetic control. Under certain\r\norders of sympathetic vibration, polar and anti-polar, the attractive\r\nsympathies of either stream can be intensified, so as to give the\r\npredominance to the celestial or to the terrestrial.\r\n\r\nIf the predominance be given to the celestial, to a certain degree,\r\non a mass of metal, it will ascend from the earth's surface, towards\r\nthe etheric field, with a velocity as according to the dominant\r\nconcentration that is brought to bear on the negative thirds of its\r\nmass chords, by inducing high radiation from their neutral centres,\r\nin combination with the power of the celestial attractive.\r\n\r\nThe power of the terrestrial propulsive and celestial attractive to\r\nlift; and these conditions reversed, or the celestial propulsive and\r\nthe terrestrial attractive, to descend. Associating these conditions\r\nwith the one of corpuscular bombardment, it is evident to me with what\r\nperfection an air-ship of any number of tons weight can, when my system\r\nis completed, be controlled in all the varied movements necessary for\r\ncomplete commercial use at any desired elevation, and at any desired\r\nspeed. It can float off into atmospheric space as gentle in motion\r\nas thistle-down, or with a velocity out-rivalling a cyclone. [29]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectro-Magnetic Radiation.\r\n\r\nIf the persistency of our vision could be reversed, so as to have the\r\npower to follow the track of the molecule's oscillations under a high\r\ncondition of vibratory acceleration, associated with the assisting\r\npower of the finest instruments known at present in scientific\r\nresearch, it would not help us to determine the period of time\r\nwherein the sympathetic actions in nature are propagated. Therefore,\r\nwe cannot, with any degree of certainty, establish a foundation whereon\r\nobservation, so associated, is reliable. (Theoretically explained in\r\n'Soul of Matter.')\r\n\r\nAs far as my researches have gone, I find that there is but\r\none condition approaching reliability; and that is in computing\r\nthe intermittent periodic disturbances along a nodal vibratory\r\ntransmitter--the nodes of gold, silver and platina--a fixed number\r\nplaced at such different distances, along its line, as to take up\r\nand equalize (by a certain order of vibratory transmissions) the\r\nchord masses of the nodal interferences between the triple metals\r\nof which the nodes are composed, and also the acoustic introductory\r\nimpulse of whatever chord is set. This will determine the rate of\r\ntheir accelerated molecular oscillation, so induced beyond their\r\nnormal standard, and give us some definite figures in the computing\r\nof vibrations, thousands of billions of times more than those of light.\r\n\r\nLight is induced by electro-magnetic percussion emanating from the\r\nether, and in its action represents the plane of magnetism. In fact it\r\nis the plane of magnetism when under polarization. [30] Some scientific\r\ntheories of the past have taught us that electricity and magnetism are\r\none and the same thing. Sympathetic vibratory philosophy teaches that\r\nthey are two distinct forces of one of the triune sympathetic family.\r\n\r\nI will try to make comprehensible the computation of the number\r\n(even to infinity) of the corpuscular oscillations, induced on\r\nthe introductory ninths, over their normal standard. The molecules\r\nof all visible masses, when not influenced by surrounding acoustic\r\nvibratory impulses, move at a rate of 20,000 oscillations per second,\r\none third of their diameters. We have before us one of these masses;\r\neither a silver dollar, a pound weight, a horse-shoe, or any other\r\nmetallic medium, which I associate to one of my nodal transmitters,\r\nthe other end of which is attached to the clustered thirds (or third\r\noctave) of my focalizing neutral concentrator. Another transmitter,\r\nof gold, silver and platina sections, is attached to the sixth cluster\r\nof same disk, the other end of which is connected to resonating sphere\r\non my compound instrument: all of which must be brought to a state\r\nof complete rest. Then, a slight tap, with a vulcanite rubber hammer\r\non the chladna resonating disk, will accelerate the 20,000 molecular\r\noscillations to 180,000 per second,--an increase of nine times the\r\nnormal number. The nine nodes each touching the extreme end, next\r\nthe mass operated upon, in this arrangement; silver, gold, platina,\r\nmake up the nine. When I associate the seventh, I start with gold\r\nand end with platina; always on the triplets. Silver represents the\r\nlowest introductory third, gold the next, and platina the highest. If\r\nwe start with a gold node, the multiplication on oscillation will\r\nbe nine times nine, or 81 times the 20,000; which is 1,620,000 per\r\nsecond. Each node represents one wave length of a certain number\r\nof vibrations when shifted along the transmitter, over the section\r\nrepresenting its opposite metal. The shifting of the gold one over\r\nthe silver extreme section will hold the corpuscular range of the\r\nmass velocity at 1,620,000 per second: the introductory chord being\r\nset at B, third octave. It requires an accelerated oscillation on\r\nthe molecules of a soft steel mass, at that chord, of a transmissive\r\nmultiplication of the full nine, in order to induce a rotary action on\r\nthe neutral centre indicator of focalizing disk; which by computation,\r\nmeans, per second, 156,057,552,198,220,000 corpuscular intermittent\r\noscillations to move the disk 110 revolutions per second. This only\r\nrepresents the multiplication on the first nodal dissociator of\r\nthe ninth. The second transition, on same, would mean this number\r\nmultiplied by itself, and the residue of each multiplication\r\nby itself 81 times progressively. This throws us infinitely far\r\nbeyond computation, leaving us only on the second of the full ninth,\r\ntowards reaching the sympathetic corpuscular velocity attending the\r\nhigh luminiferous. I have induced rotation up to 123 revolutions per\r\nsecond on a neutral indicator that required billions of vibrations\r\nper second to accomplish; but even this vibration represents only a\r\nminute fraction of the conditions governing the sympathetic vitality\r\nwhich exists in the far luminous centres.\r\n\r\nThe interposition of hydrogen gas between soap-film, of the\r\ndifferential diameters of thirds, illuminated by a solar ray in\r\nwhose focus a quiescent prism is set posteriorly--the prism to be\r\nadjusted at the proper distance and angle, to throw the seven colours\r\nthrough the film enclosing the hydrogen in a way that will give the\r\nbow an arch of three feet--will register deep down, inaudible tones\r\nor sounds, and indicate their different conditions by the dissolving\r\nand re-dissolving of certain of the colours of such arch. To conduct\r\nsuch experiments properly necessitates, first, a location as nearly\r\nisolated from all extraneous audible sounds as is possible to get;\r\nand second, a pedestal of the lowest vibrating material, the base of\r\nit set deep in the earth, to arrange the instruments upon; and third,\r\na room of the highest resonating qualities to enclose them. Under\r\nsuch conditions the inaudible sounds emanating from the operator,\r\nwould have to be neutralized by a negative device to get at the proper\r\nconditions while under his manipulation. Thus the hidden inaudible\r\nworld of sounds could be shown up, as the microscope shows up to the\r\neye the hidden invisible forms of nature.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the mechanical requirements necessary to conduct\r\nsuccessfully the line of research that I am now pursuing, will never\r\nbe properly appreciated until the beauty of this system is shown up\r\nunder perfect control for commercial use.\r\n\r\nI have spoken elsewhere of the almost infinite difficulties of getting\r\ninto position, to hold hydrogen gas in suspension between soap-film\r\na proper period of time, to conduct these experiments. The setting of\r\nthe other parts of the apparatus is quite easy in comparison. All wave\r\npropagations, electro-magnetic or otherwise, by being thus reflected\r\ncan be measured in regard to the time of their propagation; all of\r\nwhich are introductorily subservient to the luminiferous ether. The\r\ntheory put forward by \"men of science,\" in regard to electro-magnetic\r\nforces shows that they are misled by the imperfection of their\r\ninstruments. They are trying to measure the infinite by the finite;\r\nnecessitating terms of avoidance, to the instantaneous propagation of\r\nnature's sympathetic evolutions, of the same nature as the one advanced\r\nin the assertion that force does not exist in the interstitial embrace\r\nof all matter.\r\n\r\nMaxwell's theory is correct that the plane of polarized light is the\r\nplane of the magnetic force. The sympathetic vibrations associated\r\nwith polarized light constitute the pure coincident of the plane\r\nof magnetism. Therefore, they both tend to the same path, for both\r\nare inter-atomic, assimilating sympathetically, in a given time,\r\nto continue the race together; although one precedes the other at\r\nthe time of experimental evolution. The time is approaching when\r\nelectro-magnetic waves with an outreach of two feet will be produced,\r\nhaving an energy equal to that now shown up on the magnet when it is\r\nabout to kiss its keeper; and showing a radiating force too stupendous\r\nfor actual measurement.\r\n\r\nI have already shown, to a certain point, the power of this radiation,\r\nby breaking a rope that had a resisting strain of over two tons,\r\nwhich was attached to the periphery of a steel disk, twelve inches in\r\ndiameter, moving at the slow rate of one revolution in two minutes; its\r\nmolecular structure vitalized with 42,800 vibrations per second. There\r\nwas no retardation while breaking the rope, and no acceleration when\r\nit was broken. This experiment has been repeated scores of times,\r\nbefore scores of visitors who came to my laboratory for the purpose\r\nof seeing it.\r\n\r\nA computation of the conditions, already shown up in part, proves\r\nconclusively that the power of an electro-magnetic wave at an outreach\r\nof ten inches would be, if properly developed, equal to a lifting\r\nforce of 36,000 pounds on a disk but three inches in diameter. Ten\r\nof such on the periphery of a vibratory disk, 36 inches in diameter,\r\nwould represent 360,000 pounds actual lift at one revolution per\r\nminute. Perfect depolarization at one hundred times per minute would\r\nrepresent 360,000,000 pounds, lifted twelve times per minute, or 1000\r\nhorse power in the same time. An excess of 100 extra revolutions,\r\nunder the same conditions, would mean 2000 horse power per minute.\r\n\r\nBy this new system, to perfect which I am now devoting all my time\r\nand my energies, dynamos will become a thing of the past, eventually;\r\nand electric lighting will be conducted by a polar negative disk,\r\nindependent of extraneous power to run it, other than that of\r\nsympathetic polar attraction, as simple in its construction, almost,\r\nas an ordinary type-writing machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswers made in Letters from Mr. Keely, to Questions asked of Him.\r\n\r\nLight incident to any body that absorbs or reflects it does not\r\npress upon it. The radiometer of Professor Crookes's invention is not\r\noperated by the pressure of light, but by corpuscular bombardment on\r\nthe reflecting side of its vanes.\r\n\r\nYou have called my attention to the receding movement in the metal\r\nsilver, which it assumes when the flow of an alternating current\r\nfrom an electro-magnet, in front, is thrown upon it. This does not\r\nprove that light presses upon it to induce that movement. It moves\r\nby inter-atomic bombardment of some 800 millions of corpuscular\r\npercussions a second; or, more truly, by inter-sympathetic\r\nvibrations. If a homogeneous disk of gold, silver and platina,\r\nin proper proportions, were made the medium of interference, the\r\nresultant action would be startling in showing up the movement of\r\nmolecular antagonistic thirds. The movement would be very erratic and\r\ngyroscopic. If the same disk were used or an intermediate transmitter\r\nto a negative focalizer, or in other words a polar radiator only\r\none of which is in existence, by a nodal wire of gold, silver and\r\nplatina, the effect on the disk at the negative terminus would be\r\nto set into action the latent force held in its molecular embrace,\r\nand would cause it to sympathetically adhere to the focalizer, with\r\na power that would make it practically inseparable.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fitzgerald's lecture on electro-magnetic radiation shows\r\nthat scientific men are beginning to realize, and that fairly,\r\nthe truths appertaining to the new philosophy. The professor admits\r\nthat electricity and magnetism are of differential character, and\r\nhe is right. The progressive subdivision, induced on molecules by\r\ndifferent orders of sympathetic vibration, and the resultant conditions\r\nevolved on the inter-molecule and inter-atom, by introductory etheric\r\ndispersion, prove that the magnetic flow of itself is a triple one,\r\nas is also the electric. Again, the professor says that electricity\r\nand magnetism would be essentially interchangeable if such a thing\r\nexisted as magnetic conduction, adding: 'It is in this difference\r\nthat we must look for the difference between electricity and\r\nmagnetism.' Thus you see how plain it is that progressive scientists\r\nare approaching true science. The rotation of the magnetic needle,\r\nas produced in my researching experiments, proves conclusively that\r\nthe interchange spoken of, in Professor Fitzgerald's lecture, is a\r\ndifferentiated vibratory one, in which the dominant and enharmonic\r\nforces exchange compliments with each other, in a differential way;\r\nthus inducing rotation, in other words polarization and depolarization.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of sympathetic atomic vibration, through a triple\r\nnodal transmitter, induces an inter-atomic percussion, that results\r\nin triple atomic subdivision, not oscillating across the diameter\r\nof the atom, but accelerating to an infinite degree the atomic film\r\nthat surrounds it and at the same time extending the vibratory range\r\nof the atom far enough to set free the gaseous atomic element.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMolecular Dissociation.\r\n\r\nIf our sight could reach into the remote depths of the interstitial\r\nspaces which exist between the molecular ranges, and observe their\r\nwonderful action, in their oscillating motion, to and from each other,\r\nas guided by the Infinite in their sphere of vibrating action--could we\r\ncomprehend the astonishing velocity of their gaseous capsules, combined\r\nas it is with the accompanying acoustic force, we would be, as it were,\r\nparalyzed with amazement. But we would then only be bordering on the\r\nstill more remote depths of the interstitial atomic realm, stretching\r\nfar down towards the neutral depths of the inter-atomic; and again,\r\nstill farther to the borders of its etheric neutral radiating centre.\r\n\r\nIf our earth were to be submitted to the force governing the rotative\r\naction of the molecule, in its gaseous envelope, and its oscillatory\r\nrange of motion were in the same ratio to the differential magnitude of\r\neach, the force of the vibration induced by its atmospheric surrounding\r\nwould, in a short time, disintegrate its full volume, precipitating\r\nit into a ring of impalpable inter-molecular dust, many thousands\r\nof miles in diameter. If brought face to face with such conditions\r\nwe could better understand the mighty and sympathetic force which\r\nexists in the far remote domain of the molecular and atomic embrace.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, how and by what means are we able to measure\r\nthe velocity of these capsules and the differential range of\r\ntheir vibratory action? Also, how can we prove beyond dispute the\r\nfacts relating to their sympathetic government? By progressive\r\ndisintegration; this is the only way; and it is accomplished by the\r\nproper exciters of vibratory focalization; the introductory acoustic\r\nimpulses which negatize their molecular, inter-molecular, atomic and\r\ninter-atomic media of neutral attractions, towards their focalized\r\ncentres of sympathetic aggregation.\r\n\r\nI hold that the sympathetic neutral flow which exists in this remote\r\nregion is the latent power that, under the disintegration of water,\r\nis liberated; showing immense volume and infinite pressure. The\r\nsame condition of latent power exists in metallic masses and,\r\nparadoxical as it may seem, exerts its force, under the proper\r\nexciter, only in a negative attractive way, while in water in a\r\npositive one. In minerals under liberation this latent power seeks\r\nits medium of tenuous equilibrium, leaving behind an impalpable dust,\r\nthat represents molecular dissociation.\r\n\r\nIn order to get at the conditions which govern and give introductory\r\nimpulses to that peculiar force which acts on the sympathetic medium\r\nthat associates matter with matter, inducing magnetic antagonisms,\r\nit will be necessary to explain the triune conditions that govern\r\nsympathetic streams; as also the triune conditions of corpuscular\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nAll forces in nature are mind forces: magnetic, electric,\r\ngalvanic, acoustic, solar, are all governed by the triune streams of\r\ncelestial infinity; as also the molecular, inter-molecular, atomic,\r\nand inter-atomic. The remote depths of all their acoustic centres\r\nbecome subservient to the third, sixth, and ninth position of the\r\ndiatonic, harmonic and enharmonic chords; which, when resonantly\r\ninduced, concentrate concordant harmony, by reducing their range of\r\ncorpuscular motion, drawing them as if towards each other's neutral\r\ncentre of attractive infinity.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic acoustic exciters, or impulses, are: 1st. the\r\nthird diatonic; 2nd. the harmonic sixths neutralizing affinity;\r\n3rd. the enharmonic ninths--positive acceleration, which induces\r\ninfinite trajective velocity from neutral centres; in other words,\r\nneutral radiation.\r\n\r\nEvery molecule in nature represents, without variation, the same\r\nchord. Variations that show up in the mass chord of different\r\nvisible aggregations, are accounted for by the non-uniformity of\r\ntheir molecular groupings. If all were molecularly homogeneous,\r\nthe chord masses of all structures would be perfectly alike in their\r\nresonant impulses.\r\n\r\nWhen the triple introductory impulse is transmitted towards the\r\nmass to be sensitized, it subserves the molecular concordant thirds\r\nand antagonizes the discordant sixths extending the range of their\r\noscillating paths; and thus induces the highest order of repellent\r\nantagonism towards the centre of neutral equilibrium.\r\n\r\nWe will now follow out, in their progressive orders, the conditions\r\nnecessary to give to these acoustic introductory impulses the power, as\r\ntransmitted through the proper media, to induce molecular dissociation.\r\n\r\nFirst: If I wish to disturb and bring into action the latent force\r\nheld in the embrace of any molecular mass, I first find out what the\r\nharmonic chord or note of its mass represents; and as no two masses are\r\nalike, it would seem to necessitate an infinite number of variations\r\nto operate on different masses; but such is not the case. All masses\r\ncan be subserved to one general condition by the compound mechanical\r\ndevices which I use for that purpose. We will suppose that the mass to\r\nbe experimented upon, when chorded, represents B flat. Then, first,\r\nthe negative radiating focalizing bar on the disk is liberated from\r\nits dampening rod, and associated with the magnetic defocalizing\r\none. There are seven ranges of bars in all.\r\n\r\n(See symbol representing sympathetic transmissive chord of B flat,\r\nthird octave on third diatonic.)\r\n\r\nThe seven assemblings are in this order:\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Electro               Harmonic\r\n               Dominant   Magnetic   Diatonic   Enharmonic.\r\n               Negative\r\n               3rd.                  6ths.                 7ths.\r\n\r\n    I.   II.   III.       IIII.      IIIII.     IIIIII.    IIIIIII.\r\n\r\n                       Twenty-eight in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second step is to liberate, according to symbolic meaning, second\r\nharmonic bar on sixths, or neutralizing one, and third, enharmonic\r\nninths, which is the one counting from negative sevenths. Now all is\r\nin readiness for the transmissive nodal wire, one end of which must be\r\nattached to the magnetic dispersing ring, over the negative-sevenths\r\ncluster, and the other end to the high polar negative attractor. Then,\r\none end of a transmitting wire, of very fine proportions of gold,\r\nsilver and platina, is connected to the resonating sphere, and the\r\nother end to the mass to be experimented upon. I then give to the\r\nsyren a rotatory impulse of a velocity to indicate the concordant\r\nof the mass attached. If the introductory settings are all right,\r\nthe neutral centre indicator will rotate with high velocity: and\r\na single tap on the chladna wave-plate is all that is necessary to\r\ninduce pure evolution.\r\n\r\nEither attraction or dispersion can be induced on any mass by setting\r\nthe instrument to the proper triple introductory positions, towards\r\nthe mass chords it represents, either positive or negative.\r\n\r\nThis system of evolution might be expressed as disintegration induced\r\nby the intensified oscillations of inter-atomic-electro-magnetic waves.\r\n\r\nHow plainly this principle of harmonic sympathetic evolution indicates\r\nthe structural condition of the atom as one of wonderfully complex\r\nform; as also is the progressive step toward it in the molecular and\r\ninter-molecular field.\r\n\r\nDuring the effect induced by disintegration of molecular mineral\r\nmasses, there is no molecular collision when forced asunder from their\r\nradiating centres of neutrality. Their atomic and inter-atomic centres\r\nseek their media of tenuous affinity in the far borders of the etheric\r\nfield, leaving all metallic masses, that are associated with them,\r\nbehind in their virgin form.\r\n\r\nKeynote of electric-magnetic sympathy, transmissive combinations,\r\n3rds, on the subdivision of first octave B flat, diatonic. 6ths,\r\non same subdivision of 3rds, octave harmonic; and 9ths, on the same\r\nsubdivision of 6ths, octave enharmonic.\r\n\r\nI find that there is no medium in the range of vibratory philosophic\r\nresearch, that is as unerringly exact, towards the centre of\r\nsympathetic attraction, as the negative attractive influence of a\r\ncertain triple association of the metallic masses of gold, silver\r\nand platina. In fact they are as accurate indicators of the earth's\r\nterrestrial sympathetic envelope, and its triple focalized action\r\ntowards the earth's neutral centre, as the magnet is an indicator\r\nof the diversion of the attractive flow of the dominant current of\r\nthe electric stream. Although much has been written on the subject,\r\nthe conditions attending the continuous flow of the magnet remains\r\na problem that has never been solved by any other theory. Yet the\r\nsolution is very simple when harmonic vibratory influence is brought\r\nto bear upon it.\r\n\r\nThe harmonic attractive chord, thirds, induces a nodal interference\r\non that third of the triune combination of the terrestrial envelope,\r\nthat is immediately associated with this medium of interference, and\r\nmoves towards the negative pole of the magnet, then flows through\r\nit to re-associate with the full triune combination, through the\r\npositive, thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dominant\r\n    Harmonic\r\n    Enharmonic\r\n\r\n    The triune stream; one current of which is diverted from the\r\n    Dominant, flowing in at the Negative end of the magnet; and\r\n    out to join the triune terrestrial stream at the Positive end.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe continuous flow of the magnet is merely a diversion of that\r\nportion of the terrestrial envelope that electricians have never\r\ncontrolled. This third current, of this triune stream, has never been\r\nsubdivided and only slightly diverted towards the negative pole of\r\nthe magnet, flowing unbrokenly back to associate sympathetically\r\nwith the full triune combination of the earth's negative neutral\r\nforce. [31] Thus the problem is solved of the continuous and\r\nnever-ending force of the magnet, in carrying its load without any\r\ndiminution of its energy. There is no influence, as yet known, that\r\ncan break up its line of sympathetic flow as associated with the\r\ntriune combination. Polarization and de-polarization, in its action,\r\nis nodal negative interference, intermittently excited, inducing\r\ndifferential disturbance of polar sympathetic equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe attractive power, evolved by a magnet in sustaining its load,\r\nis no evidence that it is molecularly attractive: for, under the\r\ninfluence of the dominant current of the electric stream, the range\r\nof its molecular mass is not extended; but by the action induced in\r\natomic vibration, the latent, or undisturbed power, that is locked\r\nup in its atomic embrace, is put into sympathetic action, and evolves\r\nthe force that is recognized as magnetic. When its exciter is removed,\r\nit returns to atomic recesses to remain perfectly latent, until again\r\nbrought into action by its proper exciter.\r\n\r\nWhen a steel unmagnetized bar is associated with a magnetized one, the\r\nlatent force in the unmagnetized one is sympathetically brought into\r\naction, associating itself to the magnetic one, without depreciating\r\nthe power of it one iota. Dissociation and association between the\r\ntwo bars can go on indefinitely with the same result.\r\n\r\nThe suspension and propelling of an atmospheric navigator of any\r\nnumber of tons weight, can be successfully accomplished by thus\r\nexciting the molecular mass of the metal it is constructed of; and\r\nthe vibratory neutral negative attraction evolved, will bring it into\r\nperfect control, commercially, by keeping it in sympathy with the\r\nearth's triune polar stream. There is enough of this latent power\r\nlocked up in the embrace of the iron ore, that is contained in our\r\nplanet, which, if liberated and applied to proper vibratory machinery,\r\nwould furnish force enough to run the commercial power of the world:\r\nleaving millions of times more to draw upon, as the needs increase. The\r\nvelocity of the vibration governing the flow of the magnetic stream,\r\ncomes under the head of the first inter-atomic, and ranges from\r\n300,000 to 780,000 vibrations per second; the first order above odour\r\npermeating the molecules, of the glass plate of the compass (with the\r\nsame facility that atmospheric air would go through an ordinary sieve\r\nthrough which it passes), to arouse sympathetically in the needle\r\nthe concordant condition that harmonizes with its own. The course of\r\nthis sympathetic flow is governed by the full harmonic chord; and,\r\nconsequently, moves in straight lines; thus transmitting its sympathy\r\nfree of molecular interferences.\r\n\r\nThe order of vibration associated with the transmission of odour\r\nacts by sympathetic negative interference; and, consequently, moves\r\nin circles, with a velocity of 220,000 per second, at least.\r\n\r\nIf in any way the circle of its rotatory diameter could be reduced\r\nto that of its corpuscular structure, then a bottle containing an\r\nodorous substance, though sealed as hermetically as an Edison-light\r\nbulb, could no more confine its corpuscles than an open chimney the\r\nsmoke ascending from the fire burning at its base.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic influence of the terrestrial envelope gets its\r\nintroductory impulse from the infinite depths of the earth's neutral\r\ncentre. This impulse radiates in undulating lines far enough into\r\netheric space to become sympathetically associated with the etheric\r\n(or Infinite) under the same conditions that associate the mental with\r\nthe physical organism of man. We can define man's molecular condition\r\nin its physical organism as the earth, and its connective link with the\r\nconvolutionary cerebral centres as the Infinite etheric domain. Thus,\r\nwe have, represented in the planetary masses moving in etheric space,\r\nthe same conditions of governing rule as exists between the mental\r\nand physical forces.\r\n\r\nWith this medium it is plain to see how simply God works, as well as\r\nmysteriously, His wonders to perform; the mental forces kept vitalized\r\nfrom the great store-house of the etheric realm; and, in controlling\r\nthe physical, the deficit caused thereby renewed and kept balanced\r\nby the power of its sympathetic concordant receptiveness.\r\n\r\nAny visible molecular mass of metal can be so impregnated by triple\r\norders of sympathetic vibration as to give it the same sympathetic\r\ntransmissive qualities that exist in the mental forces, which make\r\nsuch mass subservient to either the attractive or repulsive conditions\r\nof terrestrial sympathy.\r\n\r\nGravity is nothing more than a concordant attractive sympathetic\r\nstream flowing towards the neutral centre of the earth. This force\r\nis inherent in all visible and invisible aggregated forms of matter,\r\nfrom the very birth of a planet, around whose centre the molecules\r\ncluster by the sympathetic affinity which is thus induced. If these\r\nconditions had always maintained a neutral position in etheric space,\r\nno planet would ever have been evolved. These conditions have been\r\nfixed by the Infinite. These rotating neutral centres, set in celestial\r\nspace, have been endowed with the power of rotation to become their\r\nown accumulators. It is through the action of these sympathetic forces\r\nof the Infinite etheric realm that planets are born, and their volume\r\nof matter augmented.\r\n\r\nIf we pick up an object, we feel a resisting power in it which\r\nphysicists call gravity; but they do not explain what gravity is. It\r\nis simply a sympathetic flow, proceeding from the molecular centres\r\nof neutrality; which flow is concordant with the earth's neutral\r\ncentre of same, seeking this medium of its affinity with a power\r\ncorresponding to the character of its molecular mass. There is no\r\nactual weight in the molecules of the mass of which the earth is\r\ncomposed. If the sympathetic negative polar stream that flows towards\r\nthe neutral centre of the earth were cut off from it, the earth's\r\nmolecular mass would become independent, and would float away into\r\nspace as would a soap-bubble filled with warm air.\r\n\r\nThe gravital flow comes, in this system, under the order of the\r\nsympathetic concordant of the 9ths, and belongs to that third of the\r\ntriune combination called polar propulsive.\r\n\r\nMagnetism is polar attraction.\r\n\r\nGravity is polar propulsion.\r\n\r\nBoth magnetism and gravity can be accelerated by the proper medium\r\nof sympathetic vibratory influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Conjecture.\r\n\r\nIf we take into proper consideration the sympathetic affinity that\r\nexists between the centres of the cerebral convolutionary organism,\r\nand the polar terrestrial forces, as linked to the celestial, or\r\nInfinite, the harmonizing effects they have on the normal brain,\r\nand the antagonistic negative bombardment of these streams on\r\nthe abnormal one, is it not possible, by the diversion of pure,\r\nsympathetic streams, to antagonize abnormal conditions, by concordant\r\nor magnetic polar sympathetic mechanical exciters, and thus to induce\r\npure normal equilibrium of its corpuscular mass?--which means perfect\r\nmental restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nPROGRESSIVE SCIENCE--KEELY's PRESENT POSITION.\r\n\r\n(A Review of the Situation.)\r\n\r\n        This amount of repetition to some will probably appear to be\r\n        tedious, but only by varied iteration can alien conceptions\r\n        be forced on reluctant minds.--Herbert Spencer.\r\n\r\n        The researches of Lodge in England and of Hertz in Germany give\r\n        us an almost infinite range of ethereal vibrations.... Here\r\n        is unfolded to us a new and astonishing world,--one which\r\n        it is hard to conceive should contain no possibilities of\r\n        transmitting and receiving intelligence.... Here also is\r\n        revealed to us the bewildering possibility of telegraphy\r\n        without wires, posts, cables, or any of our present costly\r\n        appliances.... As for myself, I hold the firm conviction that\r\n        unflagging research will be rewarded by an insight into natural\r\n        mysteries, such as now can rarely be conceived.--Professor\r\n        Wm. Crookes, M.R.A., F.R.S., &c.\r\n\r\n        Vibratory Philosophy teaches that \"in the great workshop of\r\n        Nature there are no lines of demarcation to be drawn between\r\n        the most exalted speculation and common-place practice, and\r\n        that all knowledge must lead up to one great result; that of\r\n        an intelligent recognition of the Creator through His works.\"\r\n\r\n            \"Facts are the body of science; speculation is its soul.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that there is nothing more sublime in the history\r\nof mind than the lonely struggles which generate and precede\r\nsuccess. After the admission made by Professor Rücker, M.A., at the\r\nlast meeting of the British Association, that the ether may be \"the\r\nmaterial of which all matter is composed,\" and that \"we may, perhaps,\r\nbe able to use and control the ether as we now use and control steam,\"\r\nthere would seem to be grounds for hoping that Keely's \"lonely and\r\nprolonged struggles\" to utilize in mechanics the ether product which\r\nhe obtains from his method of dissociating the elements of water,\r\nwill be more universally recognized and appreciated than they have yet\r\nbeen. Discovery may be unsought and instantaneous, but the inventions\r\nfor utilizing discoveries may be, and generally are, the work of years.\r\n\r\nKeely first imprisoned the ether in 1872, when its existence was\r\ndenied; or, if admitted by a few, it was called \"the hypothetical\r\nether.\" In 1888, Professor Henri Hertz discovered and announced,\r\nin the Revue des Deux Mondes, that the ether is held in a state of\r\nbondage in all electro-magnetic engines. Not until this fact had been\r\nmade known, were there any scientific men, with one notable exception,\r\nwho were willing to admit it was possible that Keely might also have\r\n\"stumbled over\" the manner of effecting its imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe nature of Keely's researches, and the length of time in which he\r\nhas been absorbed by the necessary dead-work, attendant upon research\r\nbefore a discovery can be utilized, may be gathered from a letter\r\nrecently written by Mr. C. G. Till, of Brooklyn, New York:--\r\n\r\n\"In Keely's early struggles, somewhere about twenty years ago, I\r\nbecame acquainted with him, and helped him then to the best of my\r\nability. Indeed I may say that I was god-father to his discovery;\r\nfor I was with him when the idea first entered his head that he\r\ncould combine steam and water to run an engine. At that time he made\r\na crude machine, which he actually ran for some time; and this was\r\nthe original model of the Pneumatic-Pulsating-Vacuo-Engine, in the\r\noperation of which he discovered his present force. From that day to\r\nthis he has been in pursuit of some method as a medium to use what\r\nhe calls his etheric force with. That he has actually discovered a\r\nnew force there is not a shadow of doubt. In those days I have known\r\nhim to sell and pawn everything of value in his house to obtain means\r\nto continue his investigations with the money thus acquired; and I am\r\nsure that he will eventually give to the world the greatest boon that\r\nhas been received by it since the advent of Christianity,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIt has been very generally thought that Keely is pursuing the ignis\r\nfatuus of perpetual motion. No greater mistake could have been\r\nmade. The genuineness of his claims as a discoverer rests upon\r\na correct answer to the question, \"Is hydrogen gas an element or\r\na compound?\"\r\n\r\nScience, as Herodotus said, is to know things truly: but science\r\ntells us that hydrogen is a simple, that the atom is not divisible,\r\nand that latent energy is not locked in the interstitial spaces of\r\nall forms of matter from their birth or aggregation. Keely's system\r\nof Vibratory Physics refutes these canons of science. How absurd\r\nmust seem the idea to many that the schools can be wrong, and that\r\nKeely, who has been branded by some of these schools as an impostor,\r\nshould be right: but time will show whether Keely's discoveries have\r\n\"come to stay.\" The history of the past shows us that science has\r\nnever been infallible; that like Christianity she unfolds her truths\r\nprogressively. Keely teaches that an unknown potency is held in the\r\natom's tenacious grasp, until released by an introductory impulse\r\ngiven by a certain order of vibration, depending upon the mass-chord\r\nof the aggregation; which impulse so increases the oscillation of\r\nthe atoms as to rupture their etheric capsules. All great truths hold\r\ngerms potential of ever-increasing growth. It took half a century for\r\nthe \"Principia\" of Newton to overcome the contempt that was showered\r\nupon it; and now progressive science is overshadowing Newton's vast\r\nattainments. In his giant mind was born the hypothesis that the ether\r\nis the cause of light and gravity. Keely has been teaching for years,\r\nthat ether is the medium of all force. For every effect science\r\nrequires an efficient cause. Hence, when Faraday found no definite\r\nknowledge in exact sciences to satisfy him on certain points he was\r\nled into speculative science, or the preliminary reaching after truths\r\nwhich we feel must exist by reason of certain effects that come under\r\nour observation, analogous to already known laws:--\"reduced facts\r\nlie behind us; speculative ones lie before us;\" and without these\r\nlatter science could make no progress. Faraday was only speculating\r\nwhen he said: \"Thus either present elements are the true elements;\r\nor else there is the probability before us of obtaining some more\r\nhigh and general power of nature even than electricity; and which,\r\nat the same time, might reveal to us an entirely new grade of elements\r\nof matter, now hidden from our view and almost from our suspicion.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday's keen perception and acute practical judgment, were never\r\nbetter exemplified than in Keely's discovery of Negative Attraction;\r\nthe laws governing which he is still researching; theorizing that it\r\nis the energy which controls the planetary masses in their advance\r\ntoward each other, and in their recession from each other,--the\r\nenergy which lifts the seas and the oceans out of their beds, and\r\nreplaces them once in twenty-four hours; in other words, explaining\r\nthe mystery of the action of gravity.\r\n\r\nHad Faraday lived longer he might have anticipated Keely in one of\r\nhis discoveries; for he certainly was on the road to it, in the views\r\nof force and matter which he held that were not in accordance with\r\nthe accepted views of his time; and which were then set aside as\r\n\"wild speculations,\" by the physicists who complained of his \"want\r\nof mathematical accuracy,\" of his \"entertaining notions altogether\r\ndistinct from the views generally held by men of science,\" who\r\ncontinued their experimental researches on their own lines.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, before Keely's scientific explorations had taught him that\r\nno engine can ever be constructed by which the ether can be used and\r\ncontrolled, as we now use and control steam, he wrote, in a letter to a\r\nfriend, \"I shall not forestall an unproved conclusion, but fight step\r\nby step the dark paths I am exploring, knowing that, should I succeed\r\nin proving one single fact in science heretofore unknown, I shall in\r\nso doing be rewarded in the highest degree. In whatever direction the\r\nhuman mind travels it comes quickly to a boundary line which it cannot\r\npass. There is a knowable field of research, bordered by an unknown\r\ntract. My experience teaches me how narrow is the strip of territory\r\nwhich belongs to the knowable, how very small the portion that has\r\nbeen traversed and taken possession of. The further we traverse this\r\nunknown territory, the stronger will become our faith in the immovable\r\norder of the world; for, at each advancing step, we find fresh fruits\r\nof the immutable laws that reign over all things,--from the falling\r\napple, up to the thoughts, the words, the deeds, the will of man:\r\nand we find these laws irreversible and eternal, order and method\r\nreigning throughout the universe. Some details of this universal method\r\nhave been worked up, and we know them by the names of 'gravitation,'\r\n'chemical affinity,' 'nerve-power,' &c. These material certainties are\r\nas sacred as moral certainties.... The nearest approach to a certainty\r\nis made through harmony with nature's laws. The surest media are\r\nthose which nature has laid out in her wonderful workings. The man\r\nwho deviates from these paths will suffer the penalty of a defeat,\r\nas is seen in the record of 'perpetual motion' seekers. I have been\r\nclassed with such dreamers; but I find consolation in the thought\r\nthat it is only by those men who are utterly ignorant of the great\r\nand marvellous truths which I have devoted my life to demonstrate\r\nand to bring within reach of all. I believe the time is near at\r\nhand when the principles of etheric evolution will be established,\r\nand when the world will be eager to recognize and accept a system\r\nthat will certainly create a revolution for the highest benefits\r\nof mankind, inaugurating an era undreamed of by those who are now\r\nignorant of the existence of this etheric force.\" These views which\r\nhave guided Keely in all his researches cannot be made known to any\r\njust, discerning mind without an accompanying perception of the gross\r\nway in which he has been misrepresented by his defamers; as well as\r\nsome appreciation of the scientifically cautious manner in which he\r\nhas pursued his investigations, since he abandoned his efforts to\r\nconstruct an engine that would hold the ether in rotation.\r\n\r\nAt the present time Keely is concentrating his efforts on the\r\nperfecting of his mechanical conditions to that point where, according\r\nto his theories, he will be able to establish, on the ninths, a\r\nsympathetic affinity with pure, polar, negative attraction, minus\r\nmagnetism. In his own opinion he has so nearly gained the summit,\r\nor completion of his \"graduation,\" as to feel that he holds the key\r\nto the control of the infinitely tenuous conditions which lie before\r\nhim to be conquered, before he gains mastery of the group of depolar\r\ndisks that he is now working upon. Twenty-six groups are completed,\r\nand when the twenty-seventh and last group is under equal control,\r\nKeely expects to establish a circuit of vibratory force, for running\r\nmachinery: both for aerial navigation and for terrestrial use. If\r\nthis result be obtained, Keely will then be in a position to give his\r\nsystem to science; and to demonstrate the ever-operative immanence of\r\nthe Infinite builder of all things of whom our Lord said, \"My Father\r\nworketh hitherto, and I work.\"\r\n\r\nIn commercial use Keely expects that when the motion has been once\r\nset up, in any of his machines, it will continue until the material\r\nis worn out. It is this claim which has caused Keely to be classed\r\nwith perpetual-motion seekers.\r\n\r\nFor years Keely has been trying to utilize his discoveries for\r\nthe material and moral advantage of humanity: and yet he feels,\r\nas Buckle has said of the present acquirements of science, that the\r\nground only is broken, that the crust only is touched. The loftiest\r\npinnacle which has been reached by the men who are foremost in their\r\nconstructions of the method by which the one source of all energy works\r\nin the material world, is too insignificant a position to obtain\r\neven an outlook towards the vast realm that Keely figuratively\r\ndescribes as the infinite brain; or the source from which all\r\n\"sympathetic-leads\" emanate, that connect mind with matter. Realizing\r\nthat all conditions of matter are but as vain illusions, he never\r\nfalters in his determination to reach after the hidden things of God,\r\nif haply he may find them. Even the goal which he seeks to attain\r\nlies, in his own estimation, on the outermost border of this crust;\r\nand well he knows that it never can be reached in any other way than\r\nby principles of exact science and by pursuing a path that is at all\r\ntimes lighted by reason.\r\n\r\nBelieving that \"the horizon of the world of matter, which has been\r\nthought to rest over hydrogen, extends to infinite reaches, including\r\nsubstances which have never been revealed to the senses,\" he knows how\r\nunfathomable is the ocean that lies beyond, and like Newton compares\r\nhimself to one who is gathering pebbles on its shore.\r\n\r\nScience, which has ever been interested both in the infinitely small\r\nand infinitely great, has in our age dropped the only clue that can\r\nguide through the obscure labyrinth which leads into depths of nature\r\nlying beyond the knowledge of our unaided senses.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the human race, says Nesbit, has passed from the\r\nphysiological into the psychological field; and it is in the latter\r\nalone that progress may be looked for.\r\n\r\nThis is the realm into which Keely's efforts, to give to the world\r\na costless motive power, have slowly conducted him through the black\r\ndarkness of the region in which he has been fighting his way, for a\r\nscore of years, in behalf of true science and humanity.\r\n\r\nLord Derby has said that modern science, on its popular side, is\r\nreally a great factory of popular fallacies; that its expounders in\r\none decade are kept busy refuting the errors to which the preceding\r\ndecade has given currency. There is hardly a branch of science, he\r\nsays, susceptible of general and wide-reaching conclusions, which\r\nmight not be revolutionized by some discovery to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIf Keely is able to establish his theories, physical science will have\r\nto abandon the positions to which she clings, and forced to admit that\r\nthere exists a purity of conditions in Vibratory Physics unknown in\r\nmechanical physics, undreamed of even in philosophy; for he will then\r\nbe in a position to demonstrate the outflow of the Infinite mind as\r\nsympathetically associated with matter visible and invisible.\r\n\r\nOf this philosophy Professor Daniel G. Brinton has said, \"It is\r\nso simple, beautiful and comprehensive in its vibratory theory\r\nthat I hope it will be found experimentally to be true. To me all\r\ncommercial and practical results, motors, air-ships, engines, are of no\r\nimportance by the side of the theoretical truth of the demonstrations\r\nof this cosmic force. As soon as Dr. Koenig is prepared to report\r\non the purely technical and physical character of the experiments,\r\nI shall be, in fact I am, ready to go into full details as to their\r\nsignificance in reference to both matter and mind. It will be enough\r\nfor me if Dr. Koenig is able to say that the force handled by Keely\r\nis not gravity, electricity, magnetism, compressed air, nor other\r\nof the well-known forces. Let him say that, and I will undertake\r\nto say what the force is.\" Tests were made last year by Dr. Koenig\r\nand Dr. Tuttle, a Baltimore physicist, in the presence of other men\r\nof science with the most sensitive galvanometer belonging to the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, all of whom were satisfied that no known\r\nforce had been detected.\r\n\r\nThe abstract of Keely's philosophy, written by Dr. Brinton, has made\r\nKeely's theories intelligible for the first time. Each new discovery\r\nnecessitates a new vocabulary; and Keely's writings are obscure\r\nbecause of his new nomenclature. When Faraday's ideas differed from\r\nthose held by the authorities of his time, they were pronounced to\r\nbe \"untranslatable into scientific language;\" and as was then said\r\nof Faraday, so can it now be said of Keely, with equal truth, that,\r\nworking at the very boundaries of our knowledge, his mind habitually\r\ndwells \"in the boundless contiguity of shade\" by which that knowledge\r\nis surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe brain of an Aristotle was needed to discern and grasp Keely's\r\nmeaning, to interpret and define it. Dr. Brinton never touches a\r\nsubject without throwing light upon it, and his penetrating mind\r\nperceived the ideas to be defined in all their relations. His keen\r\nlogical acumen separated and classified them in their order, in a true,\r\nsound, and scientific manner. In the words of Sir James Crichton\r\nBrowne, who heard Professor Brinton read this abstract in London,\r\n\"Professor Brinton's synopsis is an able, lucid and logical paper.\"\r\n\r\nNow that such distinguished men are interesting themselves in\r\nKeely's discoveries, there is no longer any danger of their being\r\nlost to science; nor to commerce, if his life is spared. The action\r\nof Dr. Pepper (Provost of the University of Pennsylvania) in January,\r\n1891, gave Keely all the protection that he then needed in order to\r\ncontinue his researches up to the completion of his system.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dewar of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, whose\r\nCambridge duties prevented him from keeping the engagement made for\r\nhim to visit Mr. Keely's workshop in December, 1891, is now compelled\r\nto wait, until notified that Keely is in a position to demonstrate\r\nhis theories, as it is desirable that he should not be interrupted\r\nin the critical work that is at present engrossing him, at times\r\neighteen hours out of the twenty-four. But although Keely has not\r\ninstructed anyone in his method of disintegrating water, to obtain\r\nthe ether, which he uses as the medium of the polar force, he does\r\nnot withhold the principle by which he obtains it. Sir John Herschell\r\nsaid, \"There is a principle in the science of music that has yet to be\r\ndiscovered.\" Pythagoras taught that the principle which underlies the\r\nharmonies of music, underlies the motion of the heavenly bodies. It is\r\nthis principle which Keely has discovered; but until he has utilized\r\nit in mechanics, he has nothing more to sell than Sir Isaac Newton\r\nhad when he discovered gravity, as Professor Fitzgerald has said.\r\n\r\nDiscovery and invention are walking side by side in our age, the\r\nglorious scientific age of the world. Never before have they so\r\nlinked themselves together, working for humanity; and it is but\r\nnatural that those savants who have seen no demonstrations of the\r\nforce Keely is handling should regard with apathy claims, which,\r\nif established, would sweep away like chaff before a whirlwind,\r\nsome of the canons of their schools. In fact, this apathy is a\r\ngreat improvement upon the active persecution of the learned men\r\nwho hurried Copernicus and Galileo to prison, and established the\r\nInquisition to deal with heretics in science as well as heretics in\r\nreligion. Commerce rushed Keely into a dungeon; science looking on\r\nin approval; notwithstanding that conjectures of the most celebrated\r\nmodern member of its school supported Keely's teachings. Galileo\r\nwas brought before the Inquisition; the tribunal pronounced him a\r\ndeluded teacher and a lying heretic. They intended to subject him to\r\nthe severest torture and death. Galileo was old, and felt that he\r\ncould not endure such a terrible death. He knelt on the crucifix,\r\nwith one hand on the Bible, and renounced all. When he arose,\r\nhowever, it is reported that he whispered to one of the attendants,\r\n\"The earth does move for all that.\" Sir Isaac Newton has written of\r\nthe possibility of discovering unknown forms of energy, in Nature,\r\nin these strong words: \"For it is well known that bodies act upon one\r\nanother by the attractions of gravity, magnetism and electricity,\r\nand these instances show the tenor and course of nature and make\r\nit not improbable that there may be more powers of attraction than\r\nthese. For Nature is very consonant and conformable to herself.\"\r\n\r\nAll progress of whatever kind would be put back, if it were in the\r\npower of bigots to arrest its triumphal march, as they have done in\r\nthe past, but the evolution of the human race remains in the hands\r\nof the Infinite One, who never fails to open up new paths when the\r\nfarther development of humanity requires it. All systems may be said\r\nto have descended from previous ones. \"The ideas of one generation\r\nare the mysterious progenitors of those in the next. Each age is the\r\ndawn of its successor; and in the eternal advance of truth,\r\n\r\n\r\n           'There always is a rising sun,\r\n            The day is ever but begun.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReligious and scientific reformation have always gone hand in hand,\r\nsays Dr. Lowber. In fact, religious science is superior to any\r\nother science. As Christianity is the pure religion which contains\r\nthe truth of all the rest, so it is the highest of the sciences,\r\nfor it represents the development of the highest faculty of the\r\nhuman nature. Religion develops manhood as nothing else will, and\r\nChristianity represents the highest culture to which it is possible\r\nfor man to attain....\r\n\r\nThe system, now being evolved and worked out to demonstration by Keely,\r\nrestores, by religious science, the faith of which materialistic\r\nscience has been robbing the world, thus confirming Dr. Lowber's\r\nassertions that materialists will never be able to reduce all natural\r\nand spiritual forces to mere vibratory action of matter; and that\r\nthe reformatory movement in philosophy, which characterizes our age,\r\nwill continue until all the sciences point to God and immortality.\r\n\r\nA writer in Galignani's Messenger, March 2, 1892, says: \"When the\r\nnineteenth century closes, the most marvellous period ever known to\r\nman will be stored away in Time's granary. Can the twentieth century\r\nby any possibility be more productive, more fertile, more prolific of\r\nwonders than its predecessor? The face of the world has been changed;\r\nspace has been annihilated; science puts 'a girdle round about the\r\nearth in forty minutes.' We may be almost excused if we are tempted\r\nto believe that the serpent's promise is fulfilled in our persons, and\r\nwe are as gods. Alas for human complacency! Perhaps our descendants a\r\nthousand years hence will look upon us as pigmies. Be that as it may,\r\nthe past and the present are ours, with their achievement, and we\r\nbelieve we shall hand down to posterity a goodly heritage.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York Home Journal, of the week before Christmas, 1892,\r\npoints out, in its leader, the road on which this advance in the\r\ncause of humanity may be made. The writer, Mr. Howard Hinton, says:\r\n\"The spirit of the salutation, 'A Merry Christmas,' lies in the desire\r\nthat peace and goodwill shall reign among men, nor, if we may trust\r\nthe intimations of the latest science, will this universality of good\r\nwishing be without avail in effecting its own accomplishment. For, as\r\nwe are told by the wise men of science, every thought, every mental\r\nimpulse of ours, sets in motion, in that realm of ether which it\r\nis said interfuses all coarser forms of matter, certain vibrations,\r\ncorresponding in force to their cause, which have power to communicate\r\nthemselves to other minds favourably conditioned to receive them,\r\nand so excite in them like thoughts and impulses.\r\n\r\n\"And are not common observation and individual experience in accord\r\nwith this suggestion of science? Do we not say at times that a\r\ncertain thought is in the air, revealing itself contemporaneously\r\nto many widely separated minds without any recognizable means of\r\ncommunication? And do we not sometimes find a noble, or it may be an\r\nignoble, impulse breaking out in a community with a suddenness and\r\nuniversality that would seem to transcend all the ordinary forms of\r\nthe contact of mind with mind? Perhaps, too, this theory of vibratory\r\ncommunication through an ethereal medium may explain, in part at least,\r\nthat 'Welt-Geist,' that 'Spirit of the Age,' of which the philosophers\r\ndiscourse so bravely.\r\n\r\n\"Again, there are times--if the experiences and observations of\r\nsensitive minds have any worth--when a general spirit of expectancy\r\nseems to be awakened, as if the world were on the eve of some new\r\nand epoch-making revelation of science, or some new enthusiasm of\r\nregenerative impulse. Are we not now, at this hour, in this mood\r\nof silent expectancy, thrilled with an indefinable awe of what the\r\nbrooding life of the world is maturing for the sons of men?--sensitive,\r\nperhaps, to ethereal vibrations that have not yet accumulated force\r\nfor expression in conscious thought or for the definite determination\r\nof our hearts' desires?\r\n\r\n\"This may be fanciful. It may be simply that we are beginning to\r\nperceive that physical science has reached a stage of development\r\nwhen some new and more central truth, some profounder generalization,\r\nis needed to give further impulse to its essential progress. It may\r\nbe that we are becoming aware that the conditions of society are\r\nsuch that some new unifying motive, some new enthusiasm of humanity\r\nis needed for its salvation; and that therefore we wait in expectancy\r\nfor what--knowing that there can be no let nor hindrance in the onward\r\nmovement of life--we feel in our hearts must come.\r\n\r\n\"And yet does not this sense of expectancy seem to communicate itself\r\nfrom mind to mind by some other means than that of oral or written\r\nexpression, and to touch with more or less force even minds that are\r\nfree from these intellectual anticipations? Are there not certain\r\nintellects at the fore-front of the world's progress, and certain\r\nhearts filled above the ordinary measure with the love of mankind,\r\nwho are thus centres of power, from whom spread ever widening\r\ncircles of vibratory emanations that gradually involve all minds in\r\na common thought and all hearts in a common purpose? 'Many men of\r\nmany minds.' Yes, truly; but there is the one mind of humanity that\r\nthinks and thinks, and alone has the power to externalize its thought\r\nas part of the world's history, while all purely individual thought\r\nis blown finally into the abyss of the Absolute Nothing.\r\n\r\n\"But it is not only the great souls that thus move and shape the\r\nworld. We are all, in various degrees, centres and distributors\r\nof the ethereal force, so far as we are in touch with its waves of\r\nvibration. We can all make our thoughts, if they are one with the\r\nthought of humanity, and our desires, if they are one with the heart\r\nof humanity, felt by our fellows in extending circles of effluence\r\ntill finally the very clods of human kind know the stirrings of a\r\nnew life and wake to the higher reality as from a dream.\r\n\r\n\"And if individually we can thus set in movement this ethereal medium,\r\nhow must not this movement be quickened and extended when collectively\r\nwe give utterance to some great thought and heart's desire, announcing\r\nit in song and prayer and merry-making. Hence the use and potency of\r\nthe great festivals, the best and sweetest of which is the Christmas\r\nfestival that we are now about to celebrate--the Evening Star of the\r\nyear that is passing, the Morning Star of the new.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFAITH BY SCIENCE: THE DAWN OF A NEW ORDER OF THINGS.\r\n\r\n        \"All for each and each for all.\"\r\n\r\n        God will take account of the selfishness of wealth, and His\r\n        quarrel has yet to be fought out.--Rev. F. Robertson.\r\n\r\n        All the great things of time have been done by single men, from\r\n        Judas Maccabeus down to Cromwell. We hear the age spoken of as\r\n        degenerative because of the vast accumulations of wealth. But\r\n        wealth may be a power for beneficence, as great brains may be,\r\n        and we have no more reason for regretting large fortunes than\r\n        large heads. No doubt to secure a perfect equality of all\r\n        people we need small heads, and small heads or empty heads\r\n        go with empty purses. By no other means can you level us. So\r\n        also by wealth the world has been moved, and will continue\r\n        to be moved. Can we consecrate money power to humanity, as\r\n        we do mind power? We do not see why not. And in our judgment\r\n        anyone who does not feel the change that is going on must\r\n        be blind. It is not legislation that will produce a moral\r\n        revolution, but a new enthusiasm. The future holds for us\r\n        a grand enthusiasm of this sort--a moralization of property\r\n        and possession.--Social Science in Science Siftings.\r\n\r\n        A wave of unrest seems to be passing over the world. Uneasiness\r\n        prevails on every side. We walk gingerly as though on the\r\n        edge of a precipice. Discontent is spreading everywhere. The\r\n        struggle between capital and labour threatens to reach\r\n        unheard-of proportions.... What is the meaning of the general\r\n        restlessness? What are its causes? Is the world growing old\r\n        and effete? Is the human race worn out? Is this generation\r\n        incapable of the great achievements of the past? Does its\r\n        materialism clog its powers and prevent its progress? Is\r\n        the world going wrong for want of an ideal? A people which\r\n        does not believe in its lofty mission will never accomplish\r\n        it. Science has made gigantic strides in our days; but have\r\n        its discoveries added much to the sum of human happiness? It\r\n        has contributed to our material comfort in various ways, but\r\n        it has not done much for the federation of the world. The\r\n        great growth of luxury is not a good, but an evil, if it\r\n        rob us of our belief in our great destiny and if it weaken\r\n        our endeavour. If \"the time is out of joint,\" is it not\r\n        possible that worship of wealth is responsible for it? \"He\r\n        who makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.\" Ours is\r\n        emphatically the age in which men \"make haste to be rich,\"\r\n        without much regard to the means. Capital has profited unduly\r\n        at the expense of labour; employers have attained to fortune\r\n        too quickly for the welfare of the employed. Commerce has\r\n        forsaken the path of safety to indulge in rash and reckless\r\n        speculation. Businesses have been converted into companies\r\n        more for the benefit of vendors and financial houses than for\r\n        the public. Company promotion has been carried to reckless\r\n        lengths, and schemes for getting rich rapidly--schemes of\r\n        the South Sea bubble order--have multiplied in every part\r\n        of the civilized world. The Nemesis has come in the shape\r\n        of restlessness, discontent, paralysis of trade, strikes,\r\n        disorganization of finance, demoralization of Bourses, and\r\n        general insecurity. It is a fact proved countless times in\r\n        history that whenever a national need is felt, a man is raised\r\n        up to supply the want.--Galignani's Messenger.\r\n\r\n        The first seal is being broken in the book of vibratory\r\n        philosophy; the first stepping-stone is placed toward\r\n        reaching the solution of that infinite problem, the origin\r\n        of life.--John Ernst Worrell Keely, 1890.\r\n\r\n        The seals are opened, as it were, under the sign Leo--as\r\n        believing that such an age is coming on in which prophecy may\r\n        be fulfilled that the earth be filled with the knowledge of\r\n        the Lord, which shall cover it with wisdom and understanding\r\n        in the deep mysteries of God.--Jane Lead, 1699.\r\n\r\n        Evils bear in themselves the causes of their own\r\n        extirpation. Providence is bringing the old order of things\r\n        to a close in order to provide place for something better\r\n        and higher.--Julian Hawthorne.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Rowland, in his paper on the \"Spectra of Metals,\" which\r\nhe read at Leeds, says that the object of his research is primarily\r\nto find out what sort of things molecules are, and in what way they\r\nvibrate. The primary object of Mr. Keely's researches has been to find\r\nout all that he could about the laws that control vibrations, and on\r\nthis line of research he made his discoveries, as to \"what sort of\r\nthings molecules and atoms are, and in what way they vibrate.\" One of\r\nthe editors of the Times, in London, in January, 1891, wrote out this\r\nquestion for Keely to answer:--\"What impulse led you primarily into the\r\nresearch of acoustic physics?\" Keely replied, \"An impulse associated\r\nsympathetically with my mental organism from birth, seemingly, as\r\nI was acutely sensible of it in my childhood. Before I had reached\r\nmy tenth year, researching in the realm of acoustic physics had a\r\nperfect fascination for me; my whole organism seemed attuned as if\r\nit were a harp of a thousand strings; set for the reception of all\r\nthe conditions associated with sound force as a controlling medium,\r\npositive and negative; and with an intensity of enjoyment not to be\r\ndescribed. From that time to the present, I have been absorbed in this\r\nresearch, and it has opened up to me the laws that govern the higher\r\nworkings of nature's sympathetic, hidden forces; leading me gradually\r\non to the solution of the problem relating to the conditions that\r\nexist between the celestial and terrestrial outreaches, viz., polar\r\nnegative attraction.\" Another question asked by the same editor:\r\n\"What is the main difficulty to be overcome before completing the\r\nsystem for commercial benefit?\" Answer: \"The principal difficulty\r\nrests in equating the thirds of the thirds of the transmitters (i.e.,\r\nthe gold, silver, and platina sections, of which the transmitting\r\nwires are composed) to free them of molecular differentiation. The\r\nfull control of this force can never be accomplished, until pure\r\nmolecular equation is established between the nodal interferences\r\n(that result in their manufacture) and the chord mass of their\r\nsectional parts. When this has been done, the chasm between the\r\nalternation of the polar forces, which now exists, preventing the\r\ninducing of polar and depolar conditions, will be bridged over and\r\ncommercial benefits at once established as the result. The devices\r\nfor inducing these conditions, primarily, are perfect: but the pure,\r\nconnective link on transmission has to be equated, before continued\r\nmechanical rotation and reversion can be attained.\"\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, Keely's researches have all been on the\r\nline of vibrations; and it was while pursuing them that he \"stumbled\r\nover,\" to use his own words, the inter-atomic subdivision of the\r\nmolecule, which released the Geni that for years thereafter was his\r\nmaster. Keely's attention not having been turned to molecules and\r\natoms, he was not able, in the earliest years of his discovery of\r\nthe existence of a \"force of nature more powerful and more general\r\neven than electricity,\" to form any opinion as to the origin of the\r\nforce. He was as one who, in the thick darkness of an underground\r\nlabyrinth, found himself face to face with a giant, whose form even he\r\ncould not see to lay hold of in a death grapple; but when a germ of\r\nthe knowledge that he needed fell on his mind, he was quick to seize\r\nit, and the acorn grew into an oak. Here again, to use his own words:\r\n\"I was as a boulder resting on the summit of a mountain, until an\r\nintroductory impulse was given to start it on its course; then rushing\r\nonwards and carrying all before it, when the goal is reached its\r\nconcussion will produce the crash that will awaken a sleeping world.\"\r\n\r\nPriestley proclaimed it as his belief that all discoveries are made by\r\nchance; but Providence sends chance, and the man of genius is he who is\r\nable to improve all opportunities and mould them to his own ends. In a\r\ndiscovery, says Edison, there must be an element of the accidental,\r\nand an important one too; discovery is an inspiration, while an\r\ninvention is purely deductive. The story of the apple dropping from\r\nthe tree, and Newton starting with a species of \"Eureka,\" he rejects\r\nabsolutely. Maintaining that an abstract idea or a natural law may,\r\nin one sense, be invented, he gives it as his opinion that Newton did\r\nnot discover the theory of gravitation, but invented it; and that he\r\nmight have been at work on the problem for years, inventing theory\r\nafter theory, to which he found it impossible to fit his facts. That\r\nKeely claims to have discovered an unknown source of energy has not\r\nseemed to disturb the equilibriums of some of the men of science who\r\nhave witnessed the demonstrations of the force, as much as that he\r\nshould have invented theories in regard to the operation of the laws\r\nthat control it. For a man who had lived more than half a century\r\nwithout troubling himself as to the existence of molecules and atoms\r\nto suddenly awaken to the knowledge of their existence, and to invent\r\ntheories as to \"what sort of things they are and how they vibrate,\"\r\nwas sufficient proof, in their eyes, that he invented his discovery;\r\nbut men who are, in thought, reaching out into unknown realms, are\r\nthe very men who are most likely to lay hold of a discovery;--as did\r\nBell, who, speculating upon the nature of sound, filed an invention\r\nfor his telephone before he discovered that articulate speech could be\r\nconveyed along a wire. It was in the same way that Keely, speculating\r\nupon the nature of vibration, was led into the field of invention; and\r\nwhile experimenting with one of his inventions, he suddenly stepped\r\ninto that great unknown territory which lies beyond the horizon of\r\nordinary matter. It took him nearly a score of years to find out where\r\nhe was. Years of experiment followed before he was able to summon\r\nthe Geni at will; for when his lever first registered a pressure\r\nof 2000 lbs., while subjecting water to the action of multiplied\r\nvibrations, he had no idea how to proceed, as far as the number of\r\nvibrations were concerned, to repeat the operation. Commencing at\r\na certain point, he increased the vibrations day by day until, six\r\nyears later, he was able to effect the dissociation at will. But at\r\nthat time Mr. Keely had too much mechanical work to do to give any\r\nof his time to theorizing. He was in the clutches of a speculating\r\nKeely Motor Company, whose cry was, \"Give us an engine!\" and day\r\nand night this toiler fought his way in the underground labyrinth,\r\nthinking only of a commercial engine. It was not until Macvicar's\r\n\"Sketch of a Philosophy\" fell into Mr. Keely's hands that he realized\r\nhe had imprisoned the ether. This was in 1884, and, four years later,\r\nin 1888, Professor Hertz of Bonn announced that we were using the\r\nether, without knowing it, in all electro-magnetic engines. By this\r\ntime Keely's researches in vibratory physics had led him well on\r\nhis way in the construction of hypotheses as to \"what sort of things\r\nmolecules are, and in what way they vibrate.\" An hypothesis treats\r\na supposed thing as an existing thing, for the purpose of proving,\r\nby experimental demonstration, whether the supposition is correct\r\nor not. At a critical juncture, Mrs. J. F. Hughes (a grand-niece of\r\nCharles Darwin), hearing of Keely's researches, became interested in\r\nhis work; and her book on \"The Evolution of Tones and Colours\" was\r\nsent to Mr. Keely. An expression used by Mrs. Hughes in that work,\r\nbrought a suggestion to Mr. Keely. The veil of darkness was rent\r\nasunder which had enveloped him in what he called \"Egyptian blackness,\"\r\nand from that time he worked no longer in the dark.\r\n\r\nPythagoras taught that the same law which underlies harmonies underlies\r\nthe motion of the heavenly bodies, or, as Mrs. Hughes has expressed it,\r\n\"The law which develops and controls harmony, develops and controls\r\nthe universe.\" Mr. Keely, nothing daunted by the vast extent, the\r\nstupendous \"outreach\" of the domain, the boundary line of which he\r\nhad thus crossed, concentrated all his energies upon \"the situation;\"\r\nthinking thereafter, not alone of the interests of commerce as before,\r\nbut of the developing of a system, which he could give to science in\r\nthe same hour that he should hand over, to those whose thoughts were\r\nonly on financial gain, the inventions that our age is demanding,\r\nin the interests of humanity, with the stern voice of the master\r\nnecessity; a voice that never fails to make itself heard in \"the voice\r\nof the people.\" Experiment after experiment justified his hypotheses,\r\nand converted them into theories. To keep pace with the wants of\r\nhumanity, invention must now walk side by side with philosophy. It took\r\nhalf a century for the \"Principia\" of Newton to tread down the contempt\r\nand opposition that its publication met with; and now progressive\r\nknowledge is overshadowing Newton's vast attainments. Faraday, after\r\ndiscovering electro-magnetic conditions, as related to latent or\r\nhidden energy, did not pursue his researches far enough to establish\r\na theory as to the mode of transference of magnetic force, though, in\r\nsome of his speculations on the line of force, he hit upon truths now\r\nadvanced in Keely's theories. The physicists of Faraday's time could\r\nnot reach up to him. They complained of his \"obscurity of language,\"\r\nof his \"want of mathematical precision,\" of his \"entertaining notions\r\nregarding matter and force altogether distinct from the views generally\r\nheld by men of science.\" It is not then to be wondered at that modern\r\nphysicists took up lines of research more in accordance with their\r\nown views. The experiences of one age are repeated in another age;\r\nand the same charges that were brought against Faraday are now brought\r\nagainst Keely; coupled with shameful attempts to prove him to be \"a\r\nfraud;\" a man \"living upon the credulity of his victims;\" \"a modern\r\nCagliostro;\" \"an artful pretender.\" The question is often asked, \"Is\r\nhe not an ignorant man?\" Yes, so ignorant, that he knows how ignorant\r\nhe is; so ignorant, that he asserts with Anaxagoras, that intelligent\r\nwill is the disposer and cause of everything; and not satisfied with\r\nasserting this great truth, he has devoted the remnant of his days\r\nto finding out and demonstrating how this cause operates throughout\r\nnature. But ignorant as Keely has always confessed himself to be, he\r\nknows more of the mysterious laws of nature which hold the planets\r\nin their courses and exert their dynamic effect upon the tides,\r\nmore of the \"shock effect\" which, brought to bear upon molecules,\r\ncauses their disruption and supplies the fine fluid thus liberated,\r\nthat extends the \"shock effect,\" as Frederick Major has conjectured, to\r\nthe atoms that compose them. Ignorant as Keely is, he knows that \"out\r\nof the strife of tremendous forces which is ever going on in nature,\r\nis born a creation of law and harmony;\" that from atomic recesses to\r\nthe farthest depth there is naught but \"toil co-operant to an end,\"\r\nthat \"all these atoms march in time, and that it is no blind cause\r\nwhich originates and maintains all.\" Admitting his ignorance, Keely\r\nclaims with Dr. Watson that \"the many who are compelled to walk should\r\nnot scoff at those who try to fly.\" All who agree in believing that\r\n\"the advance of the modern school of natural philosophy affords no\r\njustification for the intolerant and exclusive position taken by\r\ncertain physicists,\" will be ready to examine Keely's theories,\r\nin the light of his demonstrations, even although they have been\r\nstigmatized as fallacies. Science owes large obligations to many\r\nfallacious theories.\r\n\r\nCanon Moseley has said that the perfecting of the theory of epicycles\r\nis due to the astrologers of the middle ages; and that but for them the\r\nsystem of Copernicus would have remained a bare speculation, as did\r\nthat of Pythagoras for more than two thousand years. In the same way\r\nthat astrology nurtured astronomy, chemistry was cradled by alchemy.\r\n\r\nKeely welcomes criticism of his theories, and is able to answer all\r\nwho come to him with criticisms in a proper spirit. To quote one of\r\nhis own expressions, \"as far as a physical truth is concerned I never\r\nthrow up the sponge for any one.\" Of Professor Crookes, Keely wrote\r\nquite recently: \"Your friend is wrong in saying that I dabble in\r\nchemical heresies. There must be some misunderstanding on his part,\r\nfor I have never asserted that nitrogen is a necessary constituent\r\nof water. I only said that, after a thousand experiments had been\r\nconducted, there was a residual deposit, in one of my tubes, of a\r\nresinous substance that showed nitrogenous elements, which I could\r\nnot account for. I consider Professor Crookes one of the greatest of\r\ndiscoverers, and, when he understands my system, he will be one of\r\nthe first to endorse it.\"\r\n\r\nA philosophical journalist says of the force discovered by Keely,\r\nthat \"it is harder to believe in than either steam or electricity,\r\nbecause it has no visible manifestation in nature. It does not rise\r\nin white clouds from every boiling kettle, or flash with vivid light\r\nin every thunderstorm. It does not show itself in the fall of every\r\nloosened body to the earth, like gravitation, nor can it be discovered,\r\nlike oxygen, by chemical investigation. If it exists at all, it is\r\nin a form entirely passive, giving no hint of its presence until it\r\nis brought out by the patient investigator, as the sculptor's chisel\r\nbrings out the beautiful statue from the shapeless mass of marble.\r\n\r\n\"Working thus entirely in the dark, with an intangible, imponderable,\r\ninvisible something whose nature and attributes are all unknown,\r\nand whose characteristics differ essentially from those of any\r\nother known force, what wonder if the inventor's progress is slow\r\nand his disappointments many? Mr. Keely may be deceived, or he may\r\nhave discovered an actual force which he is unable to harness; but\r\nthe fact that he is very slow in perfecting whatever discovery he\r\nmay have made is no proof that he has not made a very great one.\r\n\r\n\"Far be it from us to say in this age of scientific marvels, that\r\nany proposition whatever is impossible of accomplishment; but while\r\nwe wait for Mr. Keely to make his alleged discovery public, before\r\nwe become enthusiastic over it, we would not set it down as a fraud\r\nand the reputed discovery as a humbug. It is the nature of inventors\r\nto be enthusiastic and to think that they are on the eve of success\r\nwhen, in fact, a great deal remains to be done.\r\n\r\n\"Especially is this the case in the development of a hitherto unknown\r\nforce. James Watt had a comparatively straight road to travel from his\r\nmother's tea-kettle to his first steam-engine, but it took him many\r\nyears to traverse it. More than a lifetime elapsed after Franklin drew\r\nelectricity from a cloud before Morse sent it over a telegraph wire,\r\nand Morse himself worked for years to make it available for business\r\npurposes; while men are still constantly finding new adaptations of the\r\nmysterious force of which that was the first practical application.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as Frederick Major has said, \"Science at present is too full of\r\nits own erroneous theories to accept or even notice theories outside of\r\nscience, until practically proved, and probably not even then unless\r\nthey can foist them upon the public as partially their own.\" These\r\nwords are not applicable to all men of science. There are some,\r\namong those most eminent, who, in the spirit of true science, are\r\nquite prepared for other roads to knowledge than those of our three\r\nhundred years old induction school. The late Professor W. K. Clifford,\r\nF.R.S., was one of those men who, in their earnest desire for \"truth\r\nat any cost,\" was ready to advance in every direction open to him. No\r\n\"fear of a false step\" held him back. He did not belong to the category\r\nof philosophical sceptics whom Dr. Stoney has so well classified as\r\ndamping all advance, unless it can be carried on, from the beginning,\r\nunder such conditions of perfection as are impossible in the early\r\nstages of every discovery and of almost every inquiry. Professor Stoney\r\nhas well described Keely's method of work in these remarks: \"In the\r\nscientific method of investigating the validity of our beliefs, we take\r\nour existing beliefs as our starting point, or a careful selection of\r\nthose which are fitted to enable us to advance. After the legitimate\r\nconsequences of these have been worked out, the inquirer finds himself\r\nin a better position to return and test the validity of the bases on\r\nwhich he proceeded. After these revisions, and such corrections as\r\nhe finds possible, he makes a step of a like kind farther forward:\r\nafter which another revision and another advance. Thus real progress\r\nis accomplished. Probabilities acquire strength and accumulate; and\r\nin the end a state of mind is attained replete with knowledge of the\r\nrealities within and around us. The sea of knowledge on which man\r\nmakes his brief voyage is for the most part unfathomable. He cannot\r\nhope, except near shore, to measure the whole depth, and thus attain\r\nphilosophical certainty. But the scientific student may diligently use\r\nsuch a sounding line as he possesses--that of probability--and with it\r\nexplore wide expanses under which there are no rocks nor shoals within\r\nthe utmost depth that he can plumb, and over which he may securely\r\nsail. Compare this with the situation of the philosophical sceptic,\r\ngroping among rocks along the shore, and not venturing beyond the\r\nshallow margin which he can probe with his little pole.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Clifford struck out boldly in this unfathomable ocean of\r\nknowledge, when he admitted the infinite divisibility of the atom,\r\nwhich is one of the bases of Keely's theories. And how exquisitely\r\ndid his penetrating vision pierce the mists of materialism when he\r\nwrote:--\"Every time that analysis strips from nature the gilding that\r\nwe prized, she is forging thereat a new picture more glorious than\r\nbefore, to be suddenly revealed by the advent of a new sense whereby\r\nwe see it--a new creation, at sight of which the sons of God shall\r\nhave cause to shout for joy. What now shall I say of this new-grown\r\nperception of Law, which finds the infinite in a speck of dust,\r\nand the act of eternity in every second of time? Shall I say that\r\nit kills our sense of the beautiful, and takes all the romance out\r\nof nature? And, moreover, that it is nothing more than a combining\r\nand reorganizing of our old experiences; that it never can give us\r\nanything really new; that we must progress in the same monotonous way\r\nfor ever. But wait a moment. What if this combining and organizing\r\nis to become first habitual, then organic and unconscious, so that\r\nthe sense of law becomes a direct perception? Shall we not then be\r\nreally seeing something new? Shall there not be a new revelation of\r\na great and more perfect cosmos, a universe fresh-born, a new heaven\r\nand a new earth? Mors janua vitæ, by death to this world we enter\r\nupon a new life in the next. Doubtless there shall by-and-by be\r\nlaws as far transcending those we now know as they do the simplest\r\nobservation. The new incarnation may need a second passion; but,\r\nevermore, beyond it is the Easter glory.\"\r\n\r\nIn these words there is the true ring of divinely inspired prophecy\r\nto those who know of the pure philosophy which Keely's system\r\nunfolds; teaching the \"wondrous ways of Him who is perfect in\r\nknowledge.\" Professor Clifford was one of those whom Ernest Renan has\r\nclassified as scouts in the great army, who divine beforehand that\r\nwhich becomes ere long patent to all. In their rapid and venturesome\r\nadvance they catch sight before the others of the smiling plains\r\nand lofty peaks. The student of nature has been compared to a hound,\r\nwildly running after, and here and there chancing on game, universal\r\nexploration, a beating up of the game on all sides, that and that\r\nonly is the sole possible method. And this is the spirit of those who\r\npursue their researches in a scientific frame of mind: while those\r\nwho enter the field in a sceptical mood, are indisposed to step out\r\nof the beaten track where they feel sure of their footing.\r\n\r\nThey have no ambitions to meet the fate of the trilobites in Professor\r\nClifford's amusing apologue. \"Once upon a time--much longer than six\r\nthousand years ago--the Trilobites were the only people that had eyes;\r\nand they were only just beginning to have them. Some of the Trilobites,\r\neven, had as yet no signs of coming sight. So that the utmost they\r\ncould know was that they were living in darkness, and that perhaps\r\nthere was such a thing as light. But at last one of them got so far\r\nadvanced that when he happened to come to the top of the water in\r\nthe daytime he saw the sun. So he went down and told the others that\r\nin general the world was light, but there was one great light which\r\ncaused it all. Then they killed him for disturbing the commonwealth;\r\nbut they considered it impious to doubt that in general the world was\r\nlight, and that there was one great light which caused it all. And\r\nthey had great disputes about the manner in which they had come to\r\nknow this. Afterwards, another of them got so far advanced that when\r\nhe happened to come to the top of the water, in the night-time, he\r\nsaw the stars. So he went down and told the others that in general\r\nthe world was dark, but that, nevertheless, there were a great number\r\nof little lights in it. Then they killed him for maintaining false\r\ndoctrines; but from that time there was a division amongst them,\r\nand all the Trilobites were split in two parties, some maintaining\r\none thing and some the other, until such time as so many of them had\r\nlearned to see that there could be no doubt about the matter that\r\nboth of the savant Trilobites were right.\"\r\n\r\nBacon has compared the mind of man to a prisoner in a cave with his\r\nback to the light, who sees only shadows of the events passing outside.\r\n\r\nDr. Stoney, in his paper on \"Natural Science and Ontology,\" frames a\r\nworking hypothesis, which leads up to Keely's theory, that \"the laws\r\nof the universe are the laws of thought.\" \"This is a very different\r\nthing,\" says Dr. Stoney, \"from saying that they are the laws of\r\nhuman thought. The laws of human thought bear to them the same small\r\nproportion which the laws of the action of the wheels of a watch upon\r\none another bear to the entire science of dynamics.... Natural science\r\nis thus, as it were, the study of an ever-changing shadow cast in a\r\nspecial and very indirect way by the mighty march of actual events.\"\r\n\r\n\"The history of philosophy,\" writes Ernest Renan, \"should be the\r\nhistory of the thoughts of mankind. Hence we must look upon philology,\r\nor the study of ancient literatures, as a science having a distinct\r\nobject, viz., the knowledge of the human intellect.\"\r\n\r\nThe philologist and the chemist, because of the results of the\r\nresearches of the one, and of the nature of the researches of the\r\nother, are the students who are best able to comprehend the discoveries\r\nof Keely. \"It is the characteristic and the pride of modern science to\r\nattain its most lofty results only through the most scrupulous methods\r\nof experiment, and to arrive at the knowledge of the highest laws of\r\nnature, its hands resting on its apparatus. If the highest truths can,\r\nas it were, emanate from the alembic and the crucible, why should they\r\nnot equally be the result of the study of the remains of the past,\r\ncovered with the dust of ages? Shall the philologist who toils on\r\nwords and syllables be less honoured than the student of chemistry\r\nlabouring in his laboratory? It is impossible to guess beforehand what\r\nmay result from philological researches, any more than one can know,\r\nin digging a mine, the wealth it may contain. We may be on our way to\r\nthe discovery of a new world. Science always presents itself to man as\r\nan unknown country. The most important discoveries have been brought\r\nabout in a roundabout way. Very few problems have been deliberately\r\ngrappled with at the outset, 'taken at the core.' There is nothing\r\nmore difficult to foretell than the importance with which posterity\r\nwill invest this or that order of facts; the researches that will be\r\nabandoned, the researches that will be continued. In looking for one\r\nthing one may stumble upon another; in the pursuit of a mere vision,\r\none may hit upon a magnificent reality.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a result has been attained, it is difficult to realize the trouble\r\nits attainment has cost, says Ernest Renan in \"The Future of Science.\"\r\n\r\nOf this nature have been the researches of the present distinguished\r\nProfessor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution; leading him into a\r\ndiscovery, the great importance of which the future alone can unfold.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dewar's brilliant success in producing liquid oxygen will be\r\nremembered by all who had the privilege of witnessing it last year, on\r\nthe occasion of the celebration of Faraday's Centenary. Its production\r\nis attended with the greatest difficulties; so great that Professor\r\nDewar even felt doubts as to his being successful in his attempt at\r\nthat time, which made his complete success all the more gratifying\r\nto him. When produced, it is difficult to hold and difficult to\r\nmanipulate; but nothing daunted by these difficulties, Professor Dewar\r\ncontinued his researches, subjecting it to tests which no mind less\r\npenetrating than his own would ever have thought of, with the result\r\nthat, most unexpectedly to himself, he has \"hit upon a magnificent\r\nreality.\" The ordeal to which, with consummate skill, he subjected\r\nthis unstable fluid, disclosed its marvellous affinity for the magnet;\r\nand iron is now no longer able to claim the distinction which it has\r\nhitherto enjoyed, of monopolizing the affections of the magnet. Sir\r\nRobert Ball, LL.D., F.R.S., in commenting upon this important and most\r\ninteresting addition to our knowledge of the properties of oxygen,\r\nsays:--\"Seeing that water, which is so largely composed of oxygen,\r\nis not attracted by a magnet, it might certainly have seemed unlikely\r\nthat a liquid which was nothing but pure oxygen should be affected\r\nto any noteworthy degree. I suspect, however, that Professor Dewar\r\nmust have had some sagacious reason for anticipating that the magnet\r\nwould treat liquid oxygen with much more attention than it bestowed\r\non water. At all events, whether he expected it or not, the result as\r\ndescribed was of the most extraordinary character. The liquid oxygen\r\nwas vehemently attracted by the great magnet; it seems to have leaped\r\nfrom the vessel, to have clung round the poles, and continued to adhere\r\nto them until it had all evaporated and resumed the form of gas. The\r\nappreciation of this discovery will be shared not alone by chemists,\r\nbut by all who are interested in the great truths of nature.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Keely fell upon his discovery of an unknown force, he had not\r\nthe faintest conception of the infinite extent, nor of the nature, of\r\nthe territory he had invaded. Step by step he has been led on through\r\nyears of patient and persistent research, yet even now feeling that\r\nhe has but lifted one corner of the veil of the goddess of nature,\r\nand that a lifetime is too short to do more than this. The physicists\r\nwhom Keely, in the earlier years of his discovery, invited to confer\r\nwith him as to the origin of the force which was generated by the\r\ndisintegration of water, preferred rather to pronounce him an impostor,\r\nafter witnessing his demonstrations, than to admit that such results\r\nshould have escaped the penetration of their all-powerful methods. \"It\r\nindicates,\" says Dr. Watson, \"a mistaken apprehension of the basis of\r\nour own so highly valued system of inquiry, that we should arrogate to\r\nit absolute exclusiveness, and deride, as though they were searchers\r\nafter proved impossibilities, all those who choose to make the trial\r\nwhether truth may be sought by any method besides our own.\"\r\n\r\nHistory repeats itself, but on new planes. It is not those who are\r\nmighty in their own eyes whom Providence chooses as instruments to\r\nreveal new truths to the world when the needs of humanity require\r\n\"a new order of things.\" The evolution of the human race is slow but\r\nsure. If in one century some backward steps are taken, in the next with\r\ngiant strides all is regained that seemed to have been lost. Each age\r\nanswers the need of its own time. \"The condition of mankind, during\r\nthe last quarter of the fifteenth century, bore some curious analogies\r\nto its state at present,\" writes Julian Hawthorne, under the heading,\r\n\"The New Columbus.\" \"A certain stage or epoch of human life seemed to\r\nhave run its course and come to a stop. The impulses which had started\r\nit were exhausted. Once more, it seems, we have reached the limits of\r\na dispensation, and are halted by a blank wall. There is no visible\r\nway over it, nor around it. We cannot stand still; still less can we\r\nturn back. What is to happen? What happens when an irresistible force\r\nencounters an impenetrable barrier? That was the question asked in\r\nColumbus' day, and he found an answer to it. Are we to expect the\r\nappearance of a new Columbus to answer it again? What Columbus can\r\nhelp us out of our dangers now? The time has come when the spirit\r\nof Columbus shall avouch itself, vindicating the patient purpose of\r\nHim who brings the flower from the seed. Great discoveries come when\r\nthey are needed; never too early nor too late. When nothing else will\r\nserve the turn, then, and not till then, the rock opens and the spring\r\ngushes forth. Who that has considered the philosophy of the infinitely\r\ngreat and of the infinitely minute can doubt the inexhaustibleness of\r\nnature? And what is nature but the characteristic echo of the spirit of\r\nman? A prophet has arisen, during these latter days, in Philadelphia,\r\nwho is commonly regarded as a charlatan; but men, cognizant of the\r\nlatest advances of science, admit themselves unable to explain upon\r\nany known principles the effects he produces.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What we are to expect is an awakening of the soul; the rediscovery\r\nand rehabilitation of the genuine and indestructible religious\r\ninstinct. Such a religious revival will be something very different\r\nfrom what we have known under that name. It will be a spontaneous\r\nand joyful realization by the soul of its vital relations with its\r\nCreator. Nature will be recognized as a language whereby God converses\r\nwith man. The interpretation of this language, based as it is upon an\r\neternal and living symbolism, containing infinite depths beyond depths\r\nof meaning, will be a sufficient study and employment for mankind for\r\never. Science will become, in truth, the handmaid of religion, in that\r\nit will be devoted to reporting the physical analogies of spiritual\r\ntruths, and following them out in their subtler details. Hitherto\r\nthe progress of science has been slow, and subject to constant error\r\nand revision. But as soon as physical research begins to go hand in\r\nhand with moral or psychical research it will advance with a rapidity\r\nhitherto unimagined, each assisting and classifying the other.\r\n\r\n\"The attitude of men towards one another will undergo a corresponding\r\nchange. It is already become evident that selfishness is a colossal\r\nfailure.... Recent social theorists propose a universal co-operation,\r\nto save the waste of personal competition. But competition is a\r\nwholesome and vital law; it is only the direction of it that requires\r\nalteration. When the cessation of working for one's livelihood takes\r\nplace, human energy and love of production will not cease with it,\r\nbut will persist and must find their channels. But competition to\r\noutdo each in the service of all is free from collisions, and its\r\nrange is limitless. Not to support life, but to make life more lovely,\r\nwill be the effort; and not to make it more lovely for one's self\r\nalone but for one's neighbour. Nor is this all.\r\n\r\n\"The love of the neighbour will be a true act of divine worship,\r\nsince it will then be acknowledged that mankind, though multiplied\r\nto human sense, is in essence one; and that in this universal one,\r\nwhich can have no self-consciousness, God is incarnate.\r\n\r\n\"The divine humanity is the only real and possible object of mortal\r\nadoration, and no genuine sentiment of human brotherhood is conceivable\r\napart from its recognition. But, with it, the stature of our common\r\nmanhood will grow toward the celestial. Obviously, with thoughts and\r\npursuits of this calibre to engage our attention, we shall be very\r\nfar from regretting those which harass and enslave us to-day. Leaving\r\nout of account the extension of psychical faculties, which will\r\nenable the antipodes to commune together at will, and even give us\r\nthe means of communicating with the inhabitants of other planets,\r\nand which will so simplify and deepen language that audible speech,\r\nother than the musical sounds indicative of emotion, will be regarded\r\nas a comic and clumsy archaism,--apart from all this, the fathomless\r\nriches of wisdom to be gathered from the commonest daily objects and\r\noutwardly most trivial occurrences, will put an end to all craving\r\nfor merely physical change of place and excitement. Gradually the\r\nhuman race will become stationary, each family occupying its own\r\nplace, and living in patriarchal simplicity, though endowed with\r\npower and wisdom that we should now consider god-like.... We have\r\nonly attempted to indicate what regions await the genius of the new\r\nColumbus; nor does the conjecture seem too bold that perhaps they\r\nare not so distant from us in time as they appear to be in quality.\"\r\n\r\nIf we turn, from this seemingly Utopian forecast, to the matter-of-fact\r\nutterances of Ernest Renan, we will find that he anticipates\r\nnothing less as the destiny of humanity, than the perfecting of it\r\nas a unity. Asserting that the nineteenth century is preparing the\r\nway for the enfranchisement of the mind, he proceeds logically to\r\nshow how this evolution is to be brought about, strong in the faith\r\nthat Providence will not fail in its design to secure the ultimate\r\nhappiness of the human race. To quote, at length, from Renan:--\"It\r\nis the law of science, as of every human undertaking, to draw its\r\nplans on a large scale, and with a great deal that is superfluous\r\naround them. Mankind finally assimilates only a small number of the\r\nelements of food. But the portions that have been eliminated played\r\ntheir part in the act of nutrition. So the countless generations that\r\nhave appeared and disappeared like a dream, have served to build the\r\ngreat Babel of humanity which uprises toward the sky, each layer of\r\nwhich means a people. In God's vast bosom all that lived will live\r\nagain, and then it will be true to the very letter that not a glass\r\nof water, not a word that has furthered the divine work of progress\r\nwill be lost. That is the law of humanity; an enormous and lavish\r\nexpenditure of the individual; for God only sets Himself the large,\r\ngeneral plan; and each created being finds subsequently in himself\r\nthe instincts which make his lot as mild as possible. All help to\r\naccelerate the day when the knowledge of the world shall equal the\r\nworld, when the subject and the object having become identified, God\r\nwill be complete. Philosophy up till now has scarcely been anything\r\nbut fancy, a priori, and science has only been an insignificant\r\ndisplay of learning. As for us, we have shifted the field of the\r\nscience of man. We want to know what his life is, and life means\r\nboth the body and the soul; not placed facing one another like clocks\r\nthat tick in time, not soldered together like two different metals,\r\nbut united into one two-fronted phenomenon which cannot be divided,\r\nwithout destroying it. It is time to proclaim the fact that one sole\r\nCause has wrought everything in the domain of intellect, operating\r\naccording to identical laws, but among different surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"The lofty serenity of science becomes possible only when it\r\nhandles its imperturbable instrument with the inflexibility of\r\nthe geometrician, without anger and without pity. True science, the\r\ncomplete and felt science, will be for the future, if civilization is\r\nnot once again arrested in its march by blind superstition and the\r\ninvasion of barbarism, in one form or another. But it is contended\r\nthat the inferiority of the philosophy of science consists in its\r\nbeing accessible to the small minority. This is, on the contrary,\r\nits chief title to glory, showing us that we should labour to hasten\r\nthe advent of the blessed day in which all men will have their place\r\nin the sunshine of intelligence, and will live in the true light of\r\nthe children of God. It is the property of hope to hope against hope,\r\nand there is nothing which the past does not justify us in hoping\r\nfrom the future of humanity. Perfect happiness, as I understand it,\r\nis that all men should be perfect. I cannot understand how the opulent\r\nman can fully enjoy his happiness while he is obliged to veil his face\r\nin presence of the misery of a portion of his fellow-creatures. There\r\ncan only be perfect happiness when all are equal, but there will\r\nonly be equality when all are perfect. Thus we see that it is\r\nnot a question of being happy; it is a question of being perfect;\r\na question of true religion, the only thing which is serious and\r\nsacred. Inequality is legitimate whenever inequality is necessary for\r\nthe good of humanity. Rights create themselves like other things. The\r\nFrench Revolution is not legitimate because it has taken place, but\r\nit took place because it was legitimate; the freeing of the negroes\r\nwas neither achieved nor deserved by the negroes, but by the progress\r\nin civilization of their masters. Right is the progress of humanity;\r\nthere is no right in opposition to this progress, and, vice versâ,\r\nprogress legitimizes everything. Never, since the origin of things, has\r\nhuman intelligence set itself so terrible a problem as the one which\r\nnow menaces our age. Upon the one hand, it is necessary to preserve\r\nthe conquests already secured for civilization; while upon the other,\r\nall must have their share in the blessings of this civilization. It\r\ntook centuries to conceive the possibility of a society without\r\nslavery. The traveller who looks only at the horizon of the plain,\r\nrisks not seeing the precipice or the quagmire at his feet. In the\r\nsame way, humanity when looking only to the distant object is tempted\r\nto make a jump for it, without regard to the intermediate objects\r\nagainst which it may not improbably dash itself to pieces. Socialism\r\nis, therefore, right to the extent of discerning the problem,\r\nbut solves it badly; or rather socialism is not yet possible of\r\nsolution. Reforms never triumph directly; they triumph by compelling\r\ntheir adversaries to partially adopt them in order to overcome them. It\r\nmight be said of reforms as of the crusades: 'Not one succeeded: all\r\nsucceeded.' As one sees the tide bringing the ever-collapsing waves\r\nupon the shore, the feeling aroused is one of powerlessness. The wave\r\narrived so proudly, and yet it is dashed to pieces against the sand,\r\nand it expires in a feeble career against the shore which it seemed\r\nabout to devour. But, upon reflection, one finds that this process\r\nis not as idle as it seems; for each wave, as it dies away, has its\r\neffect; and all the waves combined make the rising tide against which\r\nheaven and hell would be powerless. Humanity, when it is fatigued,\r\nis willing to pause; but to pause is not to rest. The calm is but\r\nan armistice and a breathing space. It is impossible for society to\r\nfind calm in a state when it is suffering from an open wound such as\r\nthat of to-day. The age is oppressed by this inevitable and seemingly\r\ninsoluble problem. We barricade ourselves in one party, in order not\r\nto see the reasons of the other side. The conservatives are wrong,\r\nfor the state of things which they uphold, and which they do right\r\nto uphold, is intolerable. The revolutionists are wrong; for it is\r\nabsurd to destroy when you have nothing to put in place of what you\r\ndestroy. At these epochs, doubt and indecision are the truth; the man\r\nwho is not in doubt is either a simpleton or a charlatan. Revolutions\r\nmust be made for well-ascertained principles, and not for tendencies\r\nwhich have not yet been formulated in a practical manner. They are\r\nthe upheavals of the everlasting Enceladus turning over when Etna\r\nweighs too heavily upon him. It is horrible that one man should be\r\nsacrificed to the enjoyment of another. If it were merely a question\r\nof self-indulgence, it would be better that all should have Spartan\r\nfare, than that some should have luxuries and others go hungry; but,\r\nas long as material ease is to a certain extent the indispensable\r\ncondition of intellectual perfection, the sacrifice is not effected\r\nfor the enjoyment of another individual, of the luxuries of life,\r\nbut it is made upon behalf of society as a whole. A society is\r\nentitled to what is necessary for its existence, however great may\r\nbe the apparent injustice resulting for the individual. It is the\r\nidea of the ancient sacrifice--the man for the nation. If the object\r\nof life were but self-indulgence, it would not be unreasonable that\r\neach one should claim his share, and from this point of view any\r\nenjoyment which one might procure at the expense of others would be in\r\nreality an injustice and a robbery: but the object of life, the aim\r\nof society, should be the greatest possible perfecting of all. The\r\nState is neither an institution of police, as Smith would have it,\r\nnor a charity bureau and a hospital as the Socialists would have\r\nit. It is a machine for making progress. In the state of things which\r\nI should like to see, manual labour would be the recreation of mental\r\nlabour. The immense majority of humanity is still at school: to let\r\nthem out too soon would be to encourage them in idleness. Necessity,\r\nsays Herder, is the weight of the clock which causes all the wheels\r\nto turn. Without the idea of progress, all the ideas of humanity are\r\nincomprehensible. We must keep our machines in order, if we would bring\r\ndown paradise upon earth; and paradise will be here below when all have\r\ntheir share in light, perfection, beauty, and therefore in happiness.\r\n\r\n\"It matters little whether the law grants or refuses liberty to\r\nnew ideas, for they make their way all the same; they come into\r\nexistence without the law, and they are all the better for this than\r\nif they had grown in full legality. When a river which has overflown\r\nits banks pours onward, you may erect dykes to arrest its progress,\r\nbut the flood continues to rise; you may work with eager energy and\r\nemploy skilful labourers to make good all the fissures, but the flood\r\nwill continue to rise until the torrent has surmounted the obstacle,\r\nor until, by making a circuit of the dyke, it comes back by some other\r\nway to inundate the land which you have attempted to protect from it.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the advanced views of Ernest Renan, who still sees nothing\r\nbefore us but a fresh cataclysm, a general upheaval and chaos, terrible\r\ndisturbances when human intelligence will be checkmated, thrown off\r\nthe rails so to speak, by events as yet unparalleled. We have not yet\r\nsuffered sufficiently, he says, to see the kingdom of heaven. When a\r\nfew millions of men have died of hunger, when thousands have devoured\r\none another, when the brains of the others, carried off their balance\r\nby these darksome scenes, have plunged into extravagancies of one\r\nkind and another, then life will begin anew. Suffering has been for\r\nman the mistress and the revealer of great things. Order is an end,\r\nnot a beginning; but out of respect for the rights of bears and lions\r\nare we to open the bars of a menagerie? Are these beasts to be let\r\nloose upon men? No, for humanity and civilization must be saved at\r\nany cost. But these problems, which make up the capital question of\r\nthe nineteenth century, are, in a speculative sense, insoluble; they\r\nwill be solved by brute force, says Renan. The crowd behind is ever\r\npressing forward; those in the foremost ranks are toppled over into\r\nthe yawning gulf, and when their bodies have filled up the abyss,\r\nthe last comers pass over on the level.\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose that what pseudo-science has wrested from us,\r\ntrue science is ready to restore; ready to offer all that Renan\r\nhimself tells us is necessary to open the way for the elevation of\r\nthe people, by giving all men a share in the delights of education;\r\nthus widening the basis of the brotherhood of humanity, and making\r\nroom for all at the banqueting-table of knowledge, enabling men to be\r\n\"perfect in their measure,\" for \"absolute equality is as impossible\r\nin humanity as it would be in the animal reign. Each part is perfect\r\nin the hierarchy of the parts when it is all that it can be, and does\r\nwell all that it ought to do.\"\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that true science offers confirmation of all that\r\nrevelation has taught of the attributes of the Creator of all things,\r\nreiterating the promise of a time when this knowledge shall be spread\r\nover the face of the whole earth and made known to all men. Let\r\nus imagine that, in addition to the opening of these floodgates of\r\nknowledge, the time is drawing near when machinery, unknown now, will\r\nbe employed to help the workman in his task, and abridge his hours of\r\nlabour, leaving leisure for the cultivation of his mind. Aristotle\r\nhas told us what would be the result, \"if every instrument could\r\nwork of its own accord, if the spindles worked of themselves, if the\r\nbow played the violin without being held, the contractors could do\r\nwithout workmen and the masters without slaves.\" Man would so master\r\nnature that material requirements would no longer be the supreme\r\nmotive, and human activity would be directed towards the things of\r\nthe mind. In such a state of existence men of intelligence would\r\n\"conquer the infinite.\"\r\n\r\nWe are living in a period of wondrous revelations of the power of God,\r\nand the crowning discovery of this epoch promises the fulfilment of\r\nScripture prophecy in a dispensation of harmony and peace, that will\r\nrestore to mankind that measure of faith in God and immortality, which\r\ncan alone give strength \"to endure the evil days without feeling the\r\nweight of them\" that lie between the present time and the realization\r\nof our hopes for the perfection of humanity. With the knowledge\r\nthat lies in this new revelation of the power of the All-Mighty, no\r\nhopes seem chimerical or Utopian. We shall all be as gods, when the\r\nfulness of the love of God and the power of God is made known to, and\r\nunderstood by, all men. Tossing as we are in a seething whirlpool of\r\nscepticism, threatened as are the nations with dangers on all sides,\r\nif we were bereft of our God, as the leading lights of science would\r\nhave us believe, there would be no hope for humanity. But though\r\nthe anchor of ancient faiths has been swept away by materialism,\r\nthe sheet-anchor of faith by science has been let down from heaven,\r\nas it were in our hour of peril, for the saving of the peoples:\r\nteaching as often before that the world lies in the bosom of God,\r\nlike a child in its mother's arms, who with watchful solicitude\r\nministers to its wants as they arise.\r\n\r\nReligion as revealed to us by our Holy Master, Jesus Christ, is to\r\nknow and to love the truth of things. When this religion is understood\r\nand practised, then, and not before, will the earth be full of the\r\nknowledge that it is God who is, and that all the rest only appears to\r\nbe. If anarchy and disorder would but wait for this time to arrive,\r\nno devastating cataclysms, no destroying whirlwinds, will come as\r\nforerunners to prepare the way, as in the past, for progress. The\r\nlight now dawning will usher in \"the new order of things,\" and we\r\nmay expect that an era of material prosperity will soon set in,\r\nsuch as the world has never dreamed of; arresting the outbreak of\r\nbarbarism which seems near at hand. There are some who contend that\r\nthis revelation of an unknown force will, in the hands of anarchists,\r\nput back the progress of civilization and enlightenment for centuries;\r\nthere are others who proclaim that it will take the bread from the\r\nmouths of the hungry and swell the sums amassed by capitalists. But\r\nhistory shows that discovery heralds progress, and walks with it hand\r\nin hand. With the costless and unlimited power which will be made\r\navailable, in every direction where power is required, all works\r\nof improvement will be carried out on a far grander scale than has\r\never been anticipated. The great polar stream, with its exhaustless\r\nsupply of energy, places at our disposal a force as harmless as the\r\ncurrent that draws its keeper to the magnet. We have but to \"hook\r\nour machinery on to the machinery of nature,\" and we have a safe\r\nand harmless propelling and controlling force, the conditions of\r\nwhich when once set up remain for ever, perpetual molecular action\r\nthe result. Another step made toward the conquering of the material\r\nworld which must precede the advent of the reign of the spirit.\r\n\r\nSchlegel foresaw that the only hope for a brotherhood of humanity lay\r\nin the thorough religious regeneration of the State and of science, and\r\nthat through these combined powers the underlying purpose of Eternal\r\nMind is to be made known, covering the earth with the knowledge of\r\nGod as the waters cover the beds of the seas, obtaining a complete\r\ntriumph for Christianity.\r\n\r\nIt would fill with despair the hearts of those who are working\r\nto bring about this end (so slow, so retrograde at times does the\r\nevolution seem to be) did they not know that they have an Invincible\r\nPower working with them.\r\n\r\nHistory has again repeated itself, and truth has once more had its\r\nbirth in a stable. A star has arisen in the West which heralds to all\r\nraces what the Star of Bethlehem heralded in Judea, viz. the coming\r\nof the time when the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of\r\nthe Lord. There are both Magi and shepherds now, as of old, who have\r\nwatched for the rising of this star, and who were the first to behold\r\nthe gold and crimson light of the approaching dawn; in which Faith,\r\nwhich modern science has crucified and laid away in its sepulchre,\r\nwill have its resurrection and dwell on earth for evermore--the\r\ntabernacle of God with men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN.\r\n\r\nDante called his lifetime, \"The time of my debt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n        I.\r\n\r\n        Have I not paid my debt, O God,\r\n          What have I left to give?\r\n        Yet blest my life in rendering all\r\n          To help the nations live\r\n        In harmony, in peace, in love,\r\n          As nations all will be,\r\n        When knowledge true shall cover earth\r\n          As waters cover sea.\r\n\r\n        II.\r\n\r\n        Nailed to the cross are all my hopes--\r\n          Thou hast not spared me aught:\r\n        But raised thereby above the world\r\n          Its treasures count as naught:\r\n        Empty its titles and its show,\r\n          Its honours and its fame;\r\n        Better the love of God to know\r\n          Than riches, rank, or name.\r\n\r\n        III.\r\n\r\n        Two avenues there are, 'tis said,\r\n          From paltry passions vile,\r\n        From all calamities of earth,\r\n          From artifice and wile.\r\n        Science and Art their votaries lead\r\n          From quicksands and from shoal;\r\n        Their guiding torches held aloft\r\n          Will light us to our goal.\r\n\r\n        IV.\r\n\r\n        When ended this--my \"time of debt\"--\r\n          'Tis only Thou canst know;\r\n        But when the longed-for quittance comes\r\n          I stay not here below.\r\n        Till then give me the torch of Art\r\n          To light my pathway drear,\r\n        Let Science lift my thoughts to Thee,\r\n          My lonely hours to cheer.\r\n\r\n        V.\r\n\r\n        And when my life-long debt is paid--\r\n          My soul from body free--\r\n        No bondage can enslave me more,\r\n          For I shall go to Thee.\r\n        Hasten the hour when summons comes,\r\n          To take me to my home;\r\n        Here have I lived an exile's life,\r\n          An exile forced to roam.\r\n\r\n        VI.\r\n\r\n        The face of love was turned from me\r\n          When most I felt its need,\r\n        And in the wilds my feet were set\r\n          To plough and sow the seed.\r\n        Ashes and tears to me were given;\r\n          I sat not by the way,\r\n        With folded hands to make lament,\r\n          But laboured day by day.\r\n\r\n        VII.\r\n\r\n        Thou hast not dealt one useless blow,\r\n          What time I worked in field:\r\n        Each tear of blood, each hour of toil,\r\n          Increased the harvest yield;\r\n        And now the furrows all are ploughed,\r\n          If I have paid my debt,\r\n        By waters still, in paths of peace,\r\n          Thou wilt my footsteps set.\r\n\r\n        VIII.\r\n\r\n        Æons may pass before my hopes\r\n          For earth are all fulfilled;\r\n        But let \"the dawn\" approach, I pray,\r\n          Before my lips are stilled!\r\n        And let true knowledge cover earth\r\n          As waters cover sea--\r\n        Knowledge of truth, knowledge of love,\r\n          Knowledge, dear God, of Thee!\r\n\r\n        IX.\r\n\r\n        I wait the music of the spheres,\r\n          The rhythmic pulse of earth,\r\n        Which, when Death's angelus doth ring,\r\n          Announce immortal birth:\r\n        In that blest home beyond the veil\r\n          No discord rends the air\r\n        The law of harmony prevails\r\n          And love reigns everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nKEELY'S PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\n        Mr. Keely begins with sounds whose vibrations can be known\r\n        and registered. I presume that the laws of ratio, position,\r\n        duality, and continuity, all the laws which go to mould the\r\n        plastic air by elastic bodies into the sweetness of music,\r\n        will also be found ruling and determining all in the high\r\n        silence of interior vibrations, which hold together or shake\r\n        asunder the combinations that we call atoms and ultimate\r\n        elements.--The Science of Music. D. C. Ramsay. Edited by the\r\n        Rev. John Andrew. Marcus Ward & Co.\r\n\r\n        What Keely has discovered in physics, I am in some measure\r\n        credited with discovering in metaphysics: this is nothing\r\n        strange, according to this philosophy, which shows that many\r\n        people may divine the same original truth at the same time\r\n        by means of the etheric element which connects the Deity, the\r\n        source of all truth, with all His creatures.--Preface to Vera\r\n        Vita; or, the Philosophy of Sympathy. David Sinclair. Author\r\n        of A New Creed. Digby, Long & Co., London.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract of Keely's Physical Philosophy in its main features up to\r\nthe point of practical application; by Professor Daniel G. Brinton,\r\nof the Pennsylvania University; subject to modifications and additions\r\nwhen Keely has made public his system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental conception of the Universe is force manifesting itself\r\nin rhythmical relations.\r\n\r\nThis definition is exhaustive, including both thought and extension,\r\nmatter and mind. The law for the one is the law for the other. The\r\ndistinction between them is simply relative, i.e. quantitative,\r\nnot qualitative.\r\n\r\nThe rhythmic relations in which force acts are everywhere, under all\r\nconditions, and at all times, the same. They are found experimentally\r\nto be universally expressible by the mathematical relations of thirds.\r\n\r\nThese threefold relations may be expressed with regard to their\r\nresults as,--\r\n\r\n\r\n          I. Assimilative.\r\n         II. Individualizing.\r\n        III. Dominant or Resultant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these three actions are derived the three fundamental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS OF BEING.\r\n\r\nI. Law of Assimilation: every individualized object assimilates itself\r\nto all other objects.\r\n\r\nII. Law of Individualization: every such object tends to assimilate\r\nall other objects to itself.\r\n\r\nIII. Law of the Dominant: every such object is such by virtue of the\r\nhigher or dominant force which controls these two tendencies.\r\n\r\nApplying these fundamental laws to an explanation of the universe,\r\nas it is brought to human cognition, all manifestations of force may\r\nbe treated as modes of vibrations.\r\n\r\nThe essential differences give rise to three modes of vibration:--\r\n\r\nI. The Radiating: called also the \"Dispersing,\" the \"Propulsive,\"\r\nthe \"Positive,\" and the \"Enharmonic.\"\r\n\r\nII. The Focalizing: called also the \"Negative,\" the \"Negative\r\nAttractive,\" the \"Polarizing,\" and the \"Harmonic.\"\r\n\r\nIII. The Dominant: called also the \"Etheric,\" or the \"Celestial.\"\r\n\r\nThese, it will be noted, correspond to the three laws of being. It is\r\nnot to be understood that any one of these three modes of vibration\r\ncan exist independently. Each by itself is called a \"current,\" and\r\nall three must be present in every \"stream\" or \"flow\" of force. The\r\nrelations of the currents in every flow are expressible in thirds,\r\nand it is experimentally demonstrable that the relation of the three\r\nare in the order named: as 33 1/3 : 66 2/3 : 100.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of what is called \"matter\" from the different modes\r\nof vibration is through the action of the second law, that of\r\nfocalization, or \"negative attraction,\" or \"negative affinity.\"\r\n\r\nWhere the vibrations under this mode meet, and are maintained in a\r\nstate of mutual affinity or equilibrium, there is established what\r\nis called a \"neutral centre,\" or, as otherwise expressed, \"a centre\r\nof sympathetic coincidence.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms \"neutral attraction,\" \"neutral affinity,\" \"negative\r\nattraction,\" or \"polar negative attraction,\" are employed to express\r\nthe property of a mode of vibration to direct its components towards\r\nsuch centre.\r\n\r\nAs no current or flow of force can be composed of one mode of\r\nvibration only, but must always be composed of three modes uniting in\r\nvarying thirds, we have 1 × 2 × 3 = 6 as the total possible forms of\r\nsympathetic coincidence, or, to speak in ordinary terms, there can\r\nbe six; and six only, possible forms of individualized being. These\r\nare what Keely calls the six orders of atomic subdivision, or orders\r\nof vibratory motion, and he names them as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n          I. Molecular.\r\n         II. Inter-molecular.\r\n        III. Atomic.\r\n         IV. Inter-atomic.\r\n          V. Etheric.\r\n         VI. Inter-etheric.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this list the forms of matter are arranged in the mathematical\r\nsequence of the rapidity of the oscillations of their constituent\r\nmembers; the proportion being proved by experiment to be as follows:\r\nfor the molecular orders:\r\n\r\n\r\n            1 : 3 : 9 : 27 : 81 : 243.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis arithmetical progression changes in the atomic orders to a\r\ngeometrical progression as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n            3 : 9 : 81 : 6561 : 43046721, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis same method of progression is believed to hold in all the orders\r\nof vibrations above the molecular, and soon passes into mathematical\r\ninfinity.\r\n\r\nActually, however, all matter of which we are capable of cognition\r\nthrough the medium of our senses is in one of three forms of\r\naggregation:\r\n\r\n\r\n          I. Molecular.\r\n         II. Atomic.\r\n        III. Etheric.\r\n\r\n\r\nin each of which the controlling mode of vibration is respectively,\r\n\r\n\r\n          I. The Enharmonic.\r\n         II. The Harmonic.\r\n        III. The Dominant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it must be understood that each of these modes is a positive and\r\nreal constituent of every atom and molecule.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that as every form of material aggregation is to be\r\nconsidered as a \"neutral centre of attraction,\" where the vibratory\r\nforce of all three orders are held in \"sympathetic coincidence,\" that\r\nis, in balanced activity or harmonized motion, and not by any means\r\ncancelled or mutually destroyed, there is no diminution of force,\r\nbut only temporary suspension of its radiating or propulsive activity\r\nor expression.\r\n\r\nThis is the foundation of Keely's doctrine of \"latent force,\" and\r\nof the indefinite power which can be obtained by breaking up the\r\nharmonious balance or equation of forces of every mode, which exists\r\nin every \"neutral centre,\" that is to say in every mass of matter.\r\n\r\nInsomuch as every mass of matter consists thus, in fact, of vibrations\r\nin harmonic equilibrium, related by simple proportions of thirds,\r\nit follows that every mass of every description stands in harmonic\r\nrelation to every other mass. This is, in part, what is meant by\r\nthe sympathy of all forms of matter and of motion; and it is through\r\nthe study of the methods of increasing or diminishing this sympathy\r\nthat we reach practical results in this field of research. At present\r\nthis is best accomplished by resonance; that is, through the harmonic\r\nvibrations created by musical instruments, bringing out the acoustic\r\nworld as the microscope reveals the hidden visual world.\r\n\r\nEvery visible or tangible mass of matter must be regarded as an\r\naggregation of molecules; the molecules being the true centres of\r\nthe equated forces of \"neutralized attraction.\"\r\n\r\nThese molecules have been experimentally proved by Keely to be\r\nformed of all three modes of vibration; the proof being that they\r\nrespond to all three modes when subjected to the tests of compound\r\nconcordant impulses.\r\n\r\nWhen in that state of neutral aggregation which we know as matter,\r\neach molecule is in perpetual oscillation, the range of the oscillation\r\nbeing one-third of the molecule, and its rapidity 20,000 oscillations\r\nin a second.\r\n\r\nIt is through the disturbance of this oscillatory equilibrium, by\r\nmeans of resonant impulses, that Keely alters the relations of the\r\nvibratory impulses which constitute matter. This he does by striking\r\nthe same chord in three octaves, representing the third, sixth,\r\nand ninth of the scale.\r\n\r\nOf these, the sixth reduces the range of molecular vibrations or\r\noscillations; and, by thus bringing nearer to each other the neutral\r\ncentres, increases solidification.\r\n\r\nThe ninth extends the range of molecular oscillation, and thus tends\r\nto give greater tenuity to the mass. It induces \"trajectile velocity\"\r\nfrom neutral centres, or \"neutral radiation.\" Experiment shows\r\nthat molecular dissociation does not take place until the molecule\r\nattains an oscillation approaching, if not fully reaching two-thirds\r\nof its diameter. This can be effected by means of the action of the\r\n\"enharmonic\" or \"radiating\" current applied to the mass, after its\r\nmolecules have once been disturbed by an \"introductory impulse;\"\r\nthat is, by the musical note above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe third represents the \"dominant,\" and when brought under control\r\nof a harmonic resonant impulse induces a complete rearrangement of\r\nthe modes of vibration and oscillation; in other words, will transform\r\nthe mass either into its component initial forces, or into some other\r\nform of matter.\r\n\r\nIt is the study of the dominant to which Keely has devoted his recent\r\nresearches. He aims to control the power he evolves by altering the\r\ndominant or etheric mode of vibration in the triplicate flows of force.\r\n\r\nAs all molecules and masses are mere centres of harmonized vibrations,\r\ntemporarily held in suspension by simple laws identical with those of\r\nresonance, it follows that these centres can be broken up or divided\r\nby certain orders of vibration impinging upon and disturbing them.\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar fact that a cord in vibration tends to produce a\r\nsimilar vibration in a cord placed near it. This property belongs\r\nto all vibrations, whether resonant or not, and they exert it in\r\nproportion to the \"order\" to which they belong. The distance in space\r\nto which this power extends, or can be extended, is what is called\r\n\"the sympathetic outreach\" of the current or flow.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we have \"sympathetic negative attraction,\" and\r\n\"sympathetic positive propulsion,\" with reference to the \"outreach\"\r\nof the third or dominant current of the stream, which is allied to\r\nthe order of etheric vibrations.\r\n\r\nEach molecule of a given mass of matter represents the same harmonic\r\nchord or note in its oscillatory motion. The \"chord of the mass\" is,\r\ntherefore, the chord of every molecule of the mass.\r\n\r\nBut as the condition of absolutely stable equilibrium is theoretical\r\nonly, and does not exist in nature, the chord of the mass is constantly\r\nchanging. Yet we must learn to control this \"chord of the mass\" by\r\nresonant induction, if we would gain command of the molecular forces.\r\n\r\nKeely believes he has solved this problem, by the invention of a\r\nmechanical device which brings the chords of all masses within the\r\nconditions of a few simple acoustic tests.\r\n\r\nThe range of molecular oscillation is affected differently in different\r\nsubstances when submitted to the same vibratory impulse, and these\r\nranges can be measured.\r\n\r\nIn the three metals, silver, gold, and platina, we obtain the\r\nproportions----3 : 6 : 9 :--As this is the primary relation of the\r\nmodes of vibration, a wire made of these three metals is peculiarly\r\nadapted to transmit concordant impulses; and nodes made of these\r\nsubstances placed upon a wire, transmitting resonant vibrations,\r\nindicate, by the different orders of vibration induced in them,\r\nthe rate of oscillations of the atomic constituents.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of rotation arises from the harmonic interaction of\r\nthe dominant and enharmonic elements of the flow: in other words,\r\nthe first and third, the third and ninth, etc.; those whose vibrations\r\nbear the proportions to each other 33 1/3 : 100.\r\n\r\nA practical example of rotation is a wheel in revolution on its\r\naxis. This is force in its commercial or economic aspect. To accomplish\r\nthis result by molecular vibratory action, we must gain control of\r\nthe \"negative attractive\" or \"enharmonic\" current of the triple flow,\r\nand the problem is then solved up to any limit of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than four centuries B.C., Leucippus and his disciple\r\nDemocritus--who expounded the atomic theory of his master--introduced\r\nthe doctrine of indivisible atoms, possessing within themselves a\r\nprinciple of energy. Democritus, it is said, travelling in search of\r\nwisdom, visited the Gymnosophists of India (who, by leading ascetic\r\nlives, thought they could effect a reunion of the spiritual nature\r\nof man, with the divine essence of Deity), and in so doing incurred\r\nthe risk of being deprived of the rites of sepulture by his \"waste\r\nof patrimony,\" there being a law in Abdera to that effect.\r\n\r\nAnaxagoras, Heraclitus, Empedocles and other philosophers, had taught\r\nthat matter was indefinitely divisible, but Leucippus and Democritus\r\nwere the first to assert that these particles or atoms were originally\r\ndestitute of all qualities except form and energy; and they are,\r\ntherefore, called the originators of the atomic philosophy; which is\r\nthe basis of Keely's system of sympathetic physics.\r\n\r\nSympathetic physics teaches that light is an etheric evolution,\r\npropagated by sympathetic conflict between celestial and terrestrial\r\noutflows: solar tensions as against terrestrial condensation. True\r\nluminosity cannot be induced in any other way. The high order of triple\r\nvibration, that induces (progressively) molecular and intermolecular\r\nseparation, shows luminous results which, when thus mechanically\r\nproduced, are virtually on a small scale, a facsimile of nature's\r\noperations. \"All such experiments that I have made,\" writes Keely,\r\n\"resulted in vortex motion invariably, both sympathetically and\r\notherwise. Vortex motion follows nature in all corpuscular action.\r\n\r\n\"The undulatory theory, regarding light, I have not been able to\r\nreconcile myself to, as anything but hypothetical. The conditions\r\nwhich govern electro-magnetic radiation, disprove the theory in many\r\nparticulars. The vortex action induced in space, by the differential\r\nconflict between the low and high tenuous, shows up results that\r\nharmonize with the conditions accompanying the dissociation of\r\nhydrogen and oxygen, in disintegrating water: viz., vortex action of\r\nthe highest order, but peripheral only. If it were not so, the ether\r\ncould not be held in suspension, neither in the molecular nor atomic\r\nenvelopes. Undulatory effects are produced by certain conditions of\r\nsound; and by other conditions quite opposite effects. In organ pipes,\r\nof a certain calibre, very sensitive waves occur at intervals; as\r\naccording to the character of the sound evolved; but on a combination\r\nof resonators composed of brass tubes of more than nine in number, a\r\nwave of sound, induced by certain chords passing over them, produces\r\nhigh vortex action of the air enclosed in them. The vibration of\r\ntuning forks induces alternate conditions of the air that surrounds\r\nthem, if in open atmosphere; but quite a different action presents\r\nitself when the forks are exercised in resonating tubes, set to\r\nthirds of the mass chord they represent. Then high vortex action is\r\nthe instant result. Vibrators cannot be set promiscuously in tubes,\r\nand get such results, any more than a musician can render a musical\r\ncomposition on the violin before tuning it. The conditions under which\r\nlight is evolved negatize whatever is associated with undulation, as\r\nthis word is understood by physicists. Aqueous undulations there are,\r\nbut not etheric undulations.\r\n\r\n\"The mighty forces latent in corpuscular matter, by which we\r\nare surrounded, are all held in oscillating vortex action by the\r\nInfinite Designer of workings hidden from us, until the time is ripe\r\nfor their disclosure. This latent, registered power interchanges\r\nsympathetically with the celestial radiating streams, whereby light,\r\nheat, electricity, magnetism and galvanic action are propagated in\r\ntheir different orders, vitalizing all nature with their life-giving\r\nprinciples. When this great scientific and religious truth has been\r\nmade known, and established by demonstration, all controversy as to\r\nthe source of energy will be for ever silenced. If I am the chosen\r\ninstrument to develop this knowledge, and to make known the conditions\r\nwhich surround this pure truth, it is only that I may hand the key\r\nto those who will use it to enter the doorway that opens into the\r\ninaudible, and thus gain an insight into the now invisible region\r\nof the operation of Nature's most powerful governing forces, in the\r\ncontrol, over terrestrial mind by celestial matter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flow of electricity, as set down in Keely's system, is governed\r\nby triple conditions: 1st. the dominant or high vibratory; 2nd. the\r\nsub-dominant or low vibratory; 3rd. the harmonic or undulatory; in\r\ncombination one flow. Keely writes:--\"When electrical experts can\r\nconstruct a mechanical device whereby the low vibratory conditions\r\nof the sub-dominant can be assimilated to the harmonic undulatory, by\r\nthirds, they will be able to run their dynamos without any extraneous\r\nappliances. An introductory impulse, on a certain order of vibration,\r\nbeing all that would be required to give the sub-dominant a concordant\r\nrelation to the dominant; which would more effectually operate\r\nthe dynamo than any number of steam-engines; allowing the harmonic\r\nstream to be the governor. This concordance, as towards the dominant,\r\nwould only excite its sympathetic action in a way that would divert\r\nthe ruling conditions of the two, without being submitted to the\r\ndestructive effects of the dominant current. I think many lives will be\r\nlost before such a position is attained. Tesla has reached out almost\r\nto the crest of the harmonic wave, leaving all electrical explorers\r\nfar behind him. It is only when such a condition is reached that the\r\ntrue value of electrical lighting will be understood, and extraneous\r\npower dispensed with; but, in my opinion, the present conditions for\r\ntransferring power will remain unaltered, in the use of electricity,\r\nfor generations.\r\n\r\n\"There is but one position to arrive at, that will redeem the many\r\nfailures of the past decade, in attempts to find an economizing medium\r\nfor commercial benefit in regard to power; and that position will be\r\nattained when the polar sympathetic harness is completed, which will\r\ngive to the world the control of the polar forces.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to the question, \"What do you include in the polar\r\nforces?\" Keely answers, \"Magnetism, electricity, and gravital sympathy;\r\neach stream composed of three currents, or triune streams, which\r\nmake up the governing conditions of the controlling medium of the\r\nuniverse: the infinite ninths that I am now endeavouring to graduate\r\nto a sympathetic mechanical combination, will, if I succeed, close\r\nmy researches in sympathetic physics, and complete my system. These\r\nsympathetic streams from celestial space, percussing on the dense\r\natmospheric environment of our earth, by their infinite velocities,\r\nwrest from their atomic confinement the latent energies which we call\r\nheat and light.\"\r\n\r\nQuestion.--And where do these sympathetic conditions or streams of\r\nforce have their origin?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--'So God created man in His own image, in the image of God\r\ncreated He him: male and female created He them,' Genesis i. 27. All\r\nsympathetic conditions, or streams of force, are derived (if we dare\r\nto make use of such a term in speaking of Deity) from the cerebral\r\nconvolutions of the Infinite: from the centre of the vast realm of\r\nthe compound luminous. From the celestial intermediate, the brain\r\nof Deity, proceed the sympathetic flows that vitalize the polar\r\nterrestrial forces.\"--Keely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome faint idea of the infinite patience which the nature of Keely's\r\nwork requires may be gained by a knowledge of his process of converting\r\nstraight tubes into resonating rings. The tubes, in sections long\r\nenough to form a semicircle, are passed between triple rollers,\r\nwhich are set to give them a slight bend. They are then fastened to\r\na bed-plate, and a steel ball, the exact diameter of the interior of\r\nthe tube, is passed into it and forced through it. It is then passed\r\nbetween the rollers again; which are set so as to slightly increase\r\nthe curvature, and again the interior of the tube is corrected by\r\nthe steel ball. This process is intermittently continued until the\r\nsemicircle is reached. Each process of bending and correcting requires\r\nover two hours. Eighty bends are sometimes necessary for the completion\r\nof the full circle. When the two semicircles, which form the circle,\r\nare finished, they are placed in a steel mould and kept under hydraulic\r\npressure for two or three days, to correct any lateral deflection which\r\nhas taken place in bending them. They are then taken out of the moulds\r\nand screwed rigidly to a face-plate, and joined together by a solder\r\nof refined brass and silver. Next they are placed in a hot sand bath\r\nof sufficient volume to require seventy-two hours to cool down. This\r\ncorrects the differentiation in their molecular groupings. They are\r\nthen submitted to a vibratory flow from the sympathetic negative\r\ntransmitter, until their intonation, by percussion, represents a pure\r\nunmixed chord. The indicator, attached to the rings, denotes when\r\nthis condition is attained. They are then centred on a steel shaft\r\nand rotated at the rate of 2000 revolutions per minute, surrounded\r\nby the triple circuit ring. If the indicator, on the circuit ring,\r\nshould vary five degrees on a subdivision of 8000, the process\r\nfor correcting has to be repeated until the variations are reduced\r\nto three; which is near enough to be considered perfect, inasmuch\r\nas the circular resonator will then hold the neutral focalization\r\nintact during the graduation of the full ninths, or triple triplets,\r\nfor sympathetic association to polar negative attraction.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dewar's recent brilliant achievements, in his line of\r\nexperimental research, not only have an important bearing upon one\r\nof the greatest problems of modern science, but upon the science of\r\nthe future, as forecast by Keely.\r\n\r\nThermal radiation (and its negative, cold), the field of Professor\r\nDewar's researches, in Keely's system comes below the first atomic;\r\nwhile celestial sympathetic radiation comes as the fountain head;\r\nthe compound inter-etheric, from which all aggregated matter springs,\r\nthe governing force of all aggregations. If there were no sympathetic\r\nradiation from the great celestial centre, space would be void of\r\nsuspended, or floating, earthy and gaseous matter; consequently,\r\nplanetary worlds would never have had their birth and growth.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of Professor Dewar, that an increase in low temperatures\r\nmight lead to the liquefying of hydrogen, is an admission that\r\nhydrogen may be a compound; for no simple can ever be condensed into\r\na visible form. Keely's experimental researches have proved, to his\r\nown satisfaction, that all known gases are compounds, inasmuch as,\r\nwhen the intensity which accompanies sympathetic vibration, in his\r\nprocess, is brought to bear upon any gas, it submits to dissociation.\r\n\r\nThe low temperatures with which Professor Dewar is dealing cause\r\nmolecular motion to cease; but the matter thus experimented upon is\r\nnot \"dead matter\" after this cessation of motion. Nothing can rob\r\nmatter of the latent energy which it contains; water is not robbed\r\nof it by being frozen. The oxygen and hydrogen still occupy their\r\nrelative positions and conditions, without depreciation of their\r\nvitality. Were water dead matter when frozen, its molecular activity\r\ncould not be restored by elevating its temperature. Matter can never\r\nbe robbed of its soul by any conditions of intensity of heat nor of\r\ncold that could be brought to bear upon it.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Dewar uses the term \"dead,\" in regard to matter,\r\nit is purely in reference to the present orthodox theory of heat\r\nenergy. Take the analogy of a tuning fork or a bell; both are dead,\r\nso far as sound is concerned, if they are not in vibration;--they\r\ncan be examined at rest or in motion, but science has not yet been\r\nable to do the same thing with those general motions of a molecular\r\nnature called heat. This is what Professor Dewar means by the term\r\n\"dead,\" knowing well that the molecular activity can return alike to\r\nthe fork or the molecule; only the energy must be supplied from some\r\nother source. Such are the conditions with which orthodox science is\r\ndealing, without acknowledging Deity as the fountain head of all force.\r\n\r\nNot until Professor Dewar has witnessed the dissociation of hydrogen\r\nwill he be able to judge of the truth of the claim, that for nearly\r\ntwenty years Keely has been researching the nature of the product\r\nof this dissociation: leading him to define and classify force and\r\nenergy very much as Grant Allen has done in his heretical work,\r\non this subject, published by Longmans & Co., in 1887.\r\n\r\nJames B. Alexander, in his book on \"The Dynamic Theory,\" [32] makes\r\nthis distinction between Force and Energy:\r\n\r\n\"Energy is simply the motion of material bodies, large or small. Force\r\nis the measure of energy, its degree or quantity.... The ether is\r\nthe universal agent of Energy, and the medium in all motion and\r\nphenomena. It may with propriety be called the Soul of Things.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ERNST WORRELL KEELY.\r\n\r\n\"Palmam qui meruit ferat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Prized secret of aerial space\r\n      Is thine!

F. Nisbet was commissioned to write,\r\nin behalf of this discoverer's claims on the world for patience,\r\nwhile pursuing his researches (and paid in advance for writing),\r\nillustrates the truth of this assertion. Mr. Nisbet's essay, entitled\r\n\"The Present Aspect of the Molecular Theory, or Mr. Keely's Relations\r\nto Modern Science,\" closes with these lines:--\"If science looks askance\r\nat Mr. Keely's professions, therefore, it has its reasons for doing\r\nso. These reasons, as I have shown, are not mere prejudices. In more\r\nthan one line of inquiry they have, what seems to be, a substantial\r\nbasis of fact, which must be explained away before Mr. Keely's theory\r\nof 'etheric force' can commend itself to the mind of the impartial\r\nobserver.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately, for the interests of science and of humanity, the\r\nthreatened prosecution of Mr. Keely (for obtaining money under false\r\npretences) was checkmated by Provost Pepper's action, early in January,\r\nbefore Mr. Nisbet wrote to America that he could not commence his paper\r\nuntil he had received more information; sending a series of questions\r\nto be answered by Mr. Keely. The superficial character of the essay\r\nwill be seen, when printed, as well as that Mr. Nisbet promised more\r\nthan he was able to perform when he accepted the cheque in order to\r\nenable him to devote time to the writing of a paper, for an influential\r\nquarter, which it was hoped would enlist public sympathy in Keely's\r\nbehalf. But that power which is mightier than the sword, in putting\r\ndown error and injustice, has hitherto turned its weapons against Keely\r\n(with some rare exceptions) as Mr. Nisbet did in his essay.--C.J.M.\r\n\r\n[14] This is effected by polarization and depolarization, and the\r\nrotation of a non-magnetic needle by molecular differentiation:\r\nboth needles revolving about 120 times in a second.\r\n\r\n[15] Electricians are now admitting that, in electric currents the\r\nenergy does not flow through, or along the wire, itself; but is\r\nactually transmitted by the ether vibrations outside of the wire,\r\njust as in Keely's experiments, running his musical sphere with a\r\nfine \"thread\" of silk, the energy is not transmitted through the\r\nsewing-silk, which acts only as the medium that makes the transfer\r\nof energy in this way possible; though not itself transferring it.\r\n\r\n[16] See \"Jacob Böhme, his Life and Teaching; or, Studies in\r\nTheosophy,\" by Dr. Hans Lassen Martensen.\r\n\r\n[17] The apparent comprehension of Keely's discovery by Mr. Nisbet,\r\nwas what led the compiler of this work to apply to him for help, in\r\nmaking known the nature of the researches which Keely is pursuing,\r\nat the time that Keely was threatened with imprisonment, in 1890,\r\nfor obtaining money under false pretences.\r\n\r\n[18] Mr. Keely explains the energy he is handling to be a condition of\r\nsympathetic vibration, associated with the Polar stream of our planet,\r\npositively and negatively.\r\n\r\n[19] Mr. B. (not Browne) was afterwards discovered to be an inventing\r\njournalist, who had been \"disappointed of gain,\" and whose statements\r\nconcerning Dr. Leidy had to be corrected.\r\n\r\n[20] Professor Dewar's visit to Keely's workshop has been delayed\r\nuntil he goes to America as Royal Commissioner this year.\r\n\r\n[21] One of Keely's researching instruments.\r\n\r\n[22] The universal physical law of molecular vibration is finely\r\nillustrated in the carbon pencils of the electric arc light used\r\nin some of the largest lighthouses. The molecular stir set up in\r\nthe armatures of the dynamo machines by rapid magnetization and\r\ndemagnetization is transmitted to the carbon points of the lantern,\r\nand reappears as a distinct musical tone.\r\n\r\n[23] It will be a matter of interest to those who have given attention\r\nto the laws of heredity to know that John Ernst Worrell Keely is a\r\ngrandson of a German composer, Ernst, who led the Baden-Baden orchestra\r\nin his day; and that Keely's experiments in vibration had their origin\r\nin his knowledge of music, and were commenced in his childhood.\r\n\r\n[24] See \"Untrodden Ground in Astronomy and Geology.\"\r\n\r\n[25] There are some paradoxical conditions shown up in the\r\ndisintegration of water which require further research to get at the\r\nsolution. In disintegrating, say five drops of water in a steel bulb\r\nof two cubic inches volume of atmospheric air, the force generated\r\nby the triple order of vibration, when weighed on a lever, shows ten\r\ntons pressure per square inch. In using the same number of drops in\r\nthe same bulb, and associating it with a tube of two hundred cubic\r\ninches, the result is the same in the force developed per square inch\r\nas is shown on the volume of the one of two cubic inches. The solution\r\nof this problem seems to rest in the fact that the gaseous element\r\nthereby induced even in minute quantities, must possess the property\r\nof exciting atmospheric air to that extent as to force it to give up,\r\nto quite an extended degree, the latent energy that is held in its\r\ncorpuscular depths. This introductory medium seems to act on the air in\r\nthe same manner that a spark of fire acts on a magazine of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n[26] The ether is the capsule to the molecules and atoms all the way\r\nup to the perfect stream of structural ether.\r\n\r\n[27] A volume of pure ether equivalent to the atmospheric displacement\r\ncaused by our Earth, could be compressed and absorbed in a volume of\r\none cubic inch, by the velocity and sympathetic power of the etheric\r\ntriple flows, focalizing toward the neutral centre, at the birth of\r\nthe molecule.\r\n\r\n[28] This is what Keely terms \"sympathetic outreach.\"\r\n\r\n[29] A facetious journalist commenting on this paper reprints its\r\nlast paragraphs as \"the only part that is perfectly lucid to the\r\nlay mind,\" continuing:--\"We trust Keely will continue to bombard\r\nhis corpuscles until he accomplishes it. And when he does, all other\r\nscientific men of this or any other age will sink by comparison into\r\ninsignificance. Let no man say he cannot do it. Mr. Keely, the world\r\nis still waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\n[30] Platina wires the thickness of a fine hair associated with each\r\nof the nine nodal beads, and concentrated towards a general centre\r\nof localization, attaching the other end of the wires to the focal\r\ncentre, will determine, by the magnetic conduction, the number of\r\ncorpuscular oscillations per second induced by a thought, either\r\npositive or negative, in the central centres. These are the only\r\nconditions--those of magnetic conduction--whereby the evolution of\r\na thought can be computed in regard to its force under propagation,\r\nas against the amount of latent energy set free to act as induced by\r\nsuch thought on the physical organism.\r\n\r\n[31] It is always interesting to trace the germ of a scientific idea,\r\nhypothesis, or established truth. A writer in La Lumière Electrique,\r\nvol. xlv., has drawn attention to the fact that Descartes gave a\r\ntheory of magnetism, in 1656, which resembles the modern conception\r\nof lines of stress in the ether. He considers that all magnets\r\nare traversed by a subtle fluid which flows out at the North Pole,\r\nand curving round, in the ether, re-enters at the South Pole, thus\r\ncompleting the circuit. Some of the greatest doctrines of science\r\nhave recurred again and again, like the motif of a piece of music,\r\nuntil they finally assume a definite shape and become a working part\r\nof human progress; as will be seen when Keely's system is recognized.\r\n\r\n[32] \"The Dynamic Theory of Life and Mind.\" The Housekeeper Press,\r\nMinneapolis, Minn.",
