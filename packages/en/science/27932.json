The original\r\n    collection of a few hundred specimens of crude drugs which had\r\n    been exhibited at the centennial exhibition of 1876 at\r\n    Philadelphia, has now developed into the largest collection in\r\n    the Western Hemisphere of historical objects related to the\r\n    healing arts._\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR: _Sami Hamarneh is the curator of the Division of\r\n    Medical Sciences in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of\r\n    History and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the early 1870's, leading figures from both the health professions\r\nand the general public had begun to realize the necessity for having the\r\nmedical sciences represented in the Smithsonian Institution. The impetus\r\nbehind this new feeling resulted from the action of a distinguished\r\nAmerican physician, philanthropist, and author, Joseph Meredith Toner\r\n(1825-1896), and came almost a decade before the integration of a new\r\nsection concerned with research and the historical and educational\r\naspects of the healing arts in the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, Dr. Toner established the \"Toner Lectures\" to encourage efforts\r\ntowards discovering new truths \"for the advancement of medical science\r\n... for the benefit of mankind.\" To finance these lectures, he provided\r\na fund worth approximately $3,000 to be administered by a board of\r\ntrustees consisting of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the\r\nSurgeon General of the U.S. Navy, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army\r\n(only in some years), and the president of the Medical Society of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. The interest from this fund was to compensate\r\nphysicians and scholars who were to deliver \"at least two annual memoirs\r\nor essays\" based on original research on some branch of the medical\r\nsciences and containing information which had been verified \"by\r\nexperiments or observations.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution agreed to have these\r\nlectures published by the Institution in its Miscellaneous Collections.\r\nThe first lecture given by the Assistant Surgeon of the U.S. Army, \"On\r\nthe Structure of Cancerous Tumors and the Mode in which Adjacent parts\r\nare Invaded,\" deserves credit even by current standards of scientific\r\nresearch.[2] Only 10 lectures were given between 1873 and 1890 (see\r\nbibliography), despite the recommendation for at least two every\r\nyear.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--DR. JOSEPH M. TONER, a leading physician in\r\nWashington, D.C., and founder of the \"Toner Lectures\" for the promotion\r\nand advancement of medical education and research. In 1873, Dr. Toner\r\nbecame president of the American Medical Association and, in 1874, he\r\nbecame president of the American Public Health Association. He was a\r\nphysician to St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum and St. Ann's Infants'\r\nAsylum in Washington, D.C. In addition, he was instrumental in\r\nestablishing Providence Hospital in the District of Columbia. He also\r\nprovided a workable plan for the American Medical Association's library\r\nin Washington, D.C. (1868-1871). Among his several publications are:\r\n_Contributions to the Annals of Medical Progress and Medical Education\r\nin the United States before and during the War of Independence_\r\n(Washington: Government Printing Office, 1874) and _Medical Men of the\r\nRevolution_ (1876). In 1882, he donated his large library, consisting of\r\n44,000 books and pamphlets on topics related mainly to medicine and\r\nhistory, to the Library of Congress. (_Photo courtesy of National\r\nLibrary of Medicine._)]\r\n\r\nA more direct factor, which not only contributed to the establishment of\r\na section on the healing arts, but also had a greater effect upon the\r\nSmithsonian Institution than any other event since its founding, was the\r\n1876 centennial exhibition in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent international fair commemorated the hundredth\r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. The\r\nfinest exhibits of 30 foreign countries and various States of the Union\r\nparticipating in the fair were finally donated to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution as the official depository of historical and archeological\r\nobjects for this country. As a result, the Institution's collections\r\nincreased to an extent far beyond the capacity of the first Smithsonian\r\nbuilding. This led to the erection of the National Museum, known for the\r\nlast two decades and until date of publication as the Arts and\r\nIndustries building, which was completed on March 4, 1881, and was used\r\nthat evening for the inaugural reception of incoming President James A.\r\nGarfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection of Materia Medica (1881-1898)\r\n\r\nThroughout the 19th century, the study of _materia medica_ (dealing with\r\nthe nature and properties of drugs of various kinds and origins, their\r\ncollection and mode of administration for the treatment of diseases, and\r\nthe medicinal utilization of animal products) held an increasingly\r\nimportant place among the medical sciences. In the United States, as in\r\nother civilized countries, this topic was greatly emphasized in the\r\ncurriculum of almost every school teaching the health professions.\r\nToday, the subject matter contained in this branch of science is taught\r\nunder the heading of several specialized fields, such as pharmacology,\r\npharmacognosy, and drug analysis of various types. However, when the\r\ndecision was made in 1881 to promote greater knowledge and interest in\r\nthe healing arts by creating a section devoted to such pursuits in the\r\nU.S. National Museum, the title of Section of Materia Medica was\r\nadopted. Added to this, was the fact that the bulk of the first\r\ncollections received in the Section was a great variety of crude drugs,\r\nwhich constituted much of the material then taught in the academic\r\ncourses of _materia medica_.\r\n\r\nThe new Section was included in the Department of Arts and Industries,\r\nthen under the curatorship of Assistant Director G. Brown Goode. From\r\nits beginning and for two decades, however, the Section of Materia\r\nMedica was sponsored and supervised by the U.S. Navy in cooperation with\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution. For this reason, the Navy decided not to\r\nestablish a similar bureau for a health museum as did the Army in\r\nstarting the Medical Museum (of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology)\r\nin 1862 through the efforts of Dr. William Alexander Hammond. The\r\nSmithsonian did, however, provide a clerk to relieve the curator of much\r\nof the routine work. The Section's early vigorous activities were the\r\nresult of the ingenuity of the first honorary curator, Dr. James Milton\r\nFlint (1838-1919), an Assistant Surgeon of the U.S. Navy. From the\r\nestablishment of the Section, in 1881, to 1912, Dr. Flint was curator\r\nduring separate periods for a total of nearly 25 years. For three of his\r\ntenures (1881-1884; 1887-1891; 1895-1900), he was detailed to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution by the Surgeon General of the U.S. Navy. During\r\nthe interim periods, other naval doctors were detailed as curators.\r\nFinally, in 1900, Dr. Flint retired from the Navy with the rank of Rear\r\nAdmiral and volunteered to continue his services to the National Museum.\r\nThe proposal was gladly accepted and he continued as a curator until his\r\nretirement from the Smithsonian Institution in 1912.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--REAR ADMIRAL JAMES M. FLINT, U.S. Navy surgeon\r\nand first honorary curator of the Section of Materia Medica. (_Photo\r\ncourtesy of the Library of Congress._)]\r\n\r\nThe Section commenced with a wealth of material. After the close of the\r\n1876 centennial exhibition, its _materia medica_ collection had been\r\nstored with the other collections in a warehouse, awaiting an\r\nappropriation by Congress for transfer and installation. This collection\r\nwas gradually brought into the new National Museum after that building's\r\ncompletion in 1881. Many other _materia medica_ specimens were\r\ntransferred from the Department of Agriculture. In addition to these\r\nlarge collections of crude drugs, generous contributions came from\r\nseveral prominent pharmaceutical firms such as Parke, Davis & Company of\r\nDetroit, Michigan; Wallace Brothers of Statesville, North Carolina; and\r\nSchieffelin and Company of New York City. These manufacturing houses are\r\nmentioned here because they and their agents abroad were the first to\r\ntake interest and donate to the Section, complete assortments of\r\ncontemporary remedial agents then in common use throughout the United\r\nStates and Europe, besides many hundreds of \"rare and curious drugs.\"\r\nThus, in spite of difficulties encountered from bringing several\r\ncollections into the building at one time, the _materia medica_\r\nexhibition got off to a good start.\r\n\r\nIt was Dr. Flint, the first curator, who stated in 1883 that remedial\r\nagents used by a nation or a community are as indicative of the degree\r\nof their cultural development and standard of living as is the nature of\r\ntheir food, the character of their dwellings, and their social and\r\nreligious traditions. Therefore, he felt that collections of drugs and\r\nmedical, surgical and pharmaceutical instruments and appliances should\r\nnot be thought of or designed as instructive to the specialist only, but\r\nshould also possess a general interest for the public. Because of these\r\nobjectives, Dr. Flint added, this section was conceived as a\r\ndepartmental division for the collecting and exhibiting of objects\r\nrelated to medicine, surgery, pharmacology, hygiene, and all material\r\nrelated to the health field at large.[4]\r\n\r\nDuring his first term of curatorship (1881-1884), Dr. Flint devoted much\r\nof his time to sorting, examining, identifying, and classifying the\r\n_materia medica_ specimens.[5] In 1881, he issued a memorandum of\r\ninstructions to be followed by collectors of drugs and urged them to\r\ngive detailed and accurate information regarding acquired specimens so\r\nthat they might be \"more than mere museum curiosities.\" In addition, in\r\n1883, he prepared a brief manual of classification of the _materia\r\nmedica_ collection in the Museum as well as a useful, detailed catalog\r\nof informational labels of the individual objects on exhibition. The\r\nunpublished catalog is still the property of the Smithsonian Institution\r\nArchives, Division of Medical Sciences' Library.\r\n\r\nIt was Dr. Flint's ambition to obtain a comprehensive, worldwide\r\ncollection of all substances used as remedies. Then, in order to\r\nidentify drugs from foreign countries, he tried to collect illustrated\r\nworks on medical botany and printed pharmacopoeias of all nations having\r\nthem. He rightly defined an official pharmacopoeia as \"a book containing\r\ndirections for the identification and preparation of medicines prepared\r\nand issued with the sanction of a government or organized and\r\nauthorized medical and pharmaceutical societies. Its purpose is to\r\nestablish uniformity in the nomenclature of remedies and in the\r\ncharacter and potency of the pharmaceutical preparations. It is enacted\r\nby legislation, and thus becomes binding on all who prepare drugs or\r\nsell them for medication.\" By soliciting the help of various American\r\nconsuls and Navy officers abroad, about 16 such official pharmacopoeias\r\nwere collected, making an almost complete international representation\r\nof all available, official, drug standards. With these sources of\r\ninformation, Dr. Flint compiled and arranged an international list of\r\n_materia medica_ specimens, indicating the authorized preparations of\r\neach. By so doing, the first curator of this Section took the initiative\r\nat least in proposing and, to some extent acting, on the preparation of\r\nan international pharmacopoeia of drugs used in existing authorized\r\nformularies giving \"official synonyms, and tables showing the\r\nconstituents and comparative strength of all preparations.\"[6] This\r\nundertaking is of special importance in the history of American\r\npharmacy, since it was probably the first attempt of its kind in the\r\nUnited States.[7] In addition, colored plates and photographs of\r\nmedicinal plants were collected, forming the nucleus of the Division's\r\ncurrent collection of pictorial and photographic material related to the\r\nhistory of the health field.\r\n\r\nDr. Flint also put on exhibition 630 Chinese _materia medica_ specimens\r\nfrom the 1876 Philadelphia centennial. These had been collected\r\noriginally by the Chinese Imperial Customs Commission for the centennial\r\nand were subsequently given to this country.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, the numbered objects in the Section's register amounted to\r\n1,574 entries. In the following year, 1,590 more specimens were added,\r\nmost of them drugs in their crude state. By the end of 1883, the total\r\ncollection had reached 4,037, out of which 3,240 individual drugs in\r\ngood condition were classified and put on display. Of these, about 500\r\nspecimens with beautiful illustrations of parts of their original plants\r\nhad been mounted for exhibition. The drug exhibitions also included\r\nmaterials transferred from the Department of Agriculture in 1881, which\r\noriginally had been brought from Central America and South America for\r\nthe 1876 centennial exhibition, a variety of opium specimens from\r\nTurkey, and a number of rare drugs listed in the official formulary\r\nwhich were acquired from the Museum of Karachi in what was then India.\r\n\r\nDr. Flint commented in the _Smithsonian Annual Report_ for 1883 that the\r\ncollection of cinchona barks was especially complete. It was comprised\r\nof specimens of nearly all the natural cinchona barks of South America\r\nand every known variety of the cultivated product from the British\r\ngovernment plantations in India. In addition, there were specimens from\r\nJava, Ceylon, Mexico, and Jamaica. The Indian and Jamaican barks were\r\naccompanied by herbarium specimens of the leaf and flower (and, in some\r\ncases, the fruit) of each variety of tree from which the bark was\r\nobtained.[8]\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to protect specimens liable to attack by insects, a small\r\npiece of blotting paper moistened with chloroform was inserted\r\nunderneath the stopper in each bottle. Later on, bichloride of mercury\r\nwas found to be a better insecticide.\r\n\r\nThese early collections of the Section were brought into admirable\r\ncondition and received compliments for their organization and\r\ncompleteness. In the _Smithsonian Annual Report_ for 1883, the\r\ncollections were praised as \"superior to any other in the United States\r\nand scarcely excelled by any in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--DR. HENRY GUSTAV BEYER, the second honorary\r\ncurator of the Section of Materia Medica (1884-1887). (_Photo courtesy\r\nof American Physiological Society._)]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the apparent emphasis on the displaying of drugs, the first\r\ncurator of the Section had envisioned that the exhibits eventually would\r\nembrace the entire field of the healing arts. In the _Smithsonian Annual\r\nReport_ for 1883, Dr. Flint noted that \"in the establishment of a museum\r\ndesigned to illustrate man and his environment, it is proper that the\r\nmaterials and methods used for the prevention and cure of disease should\r\nhave a place.\" However, his plans were temporarily interrupted when his\r\nfirst term as honorary curator ended in 1884.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 1884, Dr. Henry Gustav Beyer was detailed by the Department\r\nof the Navy to become the second honorary curator of the Section of\r\nMateria Medica. As a young man, Dr. Beyer (1850-1918) had come from\r\nSaxony, Germany, to the United States and, in due course, became a\r\nnaturalized citizen. He was graduated from the Bellevue Hospital\r\nMedical College of New York City in 1876.\r\n\r\nBecause of his interest in physiological experimental research, Dr.\r\nBeyer enrolled at the Johns Hopkins University, where he was awarded a\r\nPh. D. degree in 1887. Unlike his predecessor, Dr. Beyer was primarily\r\ninterested in carrying on research on the physiological action of\r\ncertain drugs and in pharmacology. This was evident from the original\r\nscientific papers mentioned in the _Smithsonian Annual Reports_ and\r\npublished by him during the period of his curatorship from 1884 to 1887.\r\n\r\nDespite the pressure of his postgraduate studies at Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, Dr. Beyer helped in arranging and classifying the _materia\r\nmedica_ collection without trying to extend materially the scope of the\r\nSection.\r\n\r\nAfter the term of Dr. Beyer expired in 1887, Dr. Flint returned to take\r\ncharge of the Section. Surprisingly, at this time, it seems that he\r\nshowed less enthusiasm and devotion to the work of the Museum which he\r\nhad previously served so well. It could have been a disappointment\r\nresulting from a lack of evidence of any real progress in the Section\r\nsince he had left it three years before. Whatever the reasons may have\r\nbeen, the _Smithsonian Annual Reports_ show that only a few hundred\r\nspecimens were added to the _materia medica_ collections between 1887\r\nand 1890, bringing the total to 5,915 preserved in good condition.\r\nFurther curtailment of the Section's activities began in November 1891\r\nwhen Dr. Flint was again transferred to other duties for the U.S. Navy.\r\nFrom November 1891 to May 24, 1895, curatorship of the Section was\r\ncharged to five physicians of the U.S. Navy: Drs. John C. Boyd (from\r\nNovember 1891 to April 6, 1892); William S. Dixon (April 1892 to January\r\n5, 1893); C. H. White (January 1893 to July 15, 1893); C. U. Gravatt\r\n(July 1893 to January 22, 1894); R. A. Marmion (January 22, 1894 to June\r\n15, 1894); and to Medical Inspector Daniel McMurtrie (June 1894 to May\r\n24, 1895). During this interim of nearly three and a half years, there\r\nwere neither literary contributions nor additions made to the\r\ncollections of the Section that were of any significance. The reason is\r\nobvious, for all of these curators averaged less than seven months of\r\nservice which is not enough time, even for a well-trained individual, to\r\naccomplish very much in a museum. Therefore, it is easy to imagine that\r\nwhen the Secretary of the Navy detailed Dr. Flint for a third time to\r\ntake charge of the Section, he was rather discouraged. Nevertheless, at\r\nthe Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, from\r\nSeptember 18 to December 31, 1895, the _materia medica_ was represented\r\nby two displays: one on mineral waters and amounts of solid constituents\r\nin pure state; and another showing the quantities of minerals after\r\nanalysis of the composition of the human body.\r\n\r\nA similar project was undertaken in 1897 at the Tennessee Centennial\r\nExposition (May 1 to October 31) in Nashville, where there were two\r\ndisplays of _materia medica_. One showed several kinds of the cinchona\r\nbarks and the medicinal preparations made from them, and another\r\ncontaining the commercial varieties of the alkaloids of opium.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Dr. Flint's attention turned to a new phase of medical\r\nexhibition. He felt the need for a program of exhibits on the practice\r\nand the historical development of the healing arts. A change of the\r\nSection's name was deemed necessary and, thus, in 1898 the more\r\ncomprehensive title of Division of Medicine was adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Medicine (1898-1939)\r\n\r\nThe statement by L. Emmett Holt of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical\r\nResearch, that before 1906, the Smithsonian Institution was never a\r\nbeneficiary to medicine in any form,[9] is not entirely applicable. The\r\nprevious discussion has clearly shown that the U.S. National Museum's\r\ncooperation with the Navy contributed materially towards encouraging and\r\npromoting medical knowledge. Furthermore, Dr. Flint tried to bring many\r\nof his plans for this medical division of the Museum to a practical\r\nfulfillment. He devised a program for presenting medical history in a\r\nway which would be of interest both to the public and to the profession.\r\nIn order to best illustrate the history of the healing art, he divided\r\nhis subject matter into five provisional classifications according to\r\nthe _Report upon the Condition and Progress of the U.S. National Museum_\r\nduring 1898:\r\n\r\n    1. Magical medicine including exorcism, amulets, talismans,\r\n    fetishes and incantation;\r\n\r\n    2. Psychical medicine including faith cures, and hypnotism;\r\n\r\n    3. Physical and external medicine including baths, exercise,\r\n    electricity, massage, surgery, cautery, and blood-letting;\r\n\r\n    4. Internal medicine including medications and treatment used by\r\n    the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Hindus, Arabians, and Chinese;\r\n    and\r\n\r\n    5. Preventive medicine including beverages, food, soil, clothing\r\n    and habitation.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly to Dr. Flint's credit that from its early conception,\r\nfirst as Section of Materia Medica and thereafter as Division of\r\nMedicine, he planned for an all-embracing exhibition and reference\r\ncollection of the medical sciences. Until the end of the 19th century\r\nand the early years of the 20th century, crude drugs as well as\r\nprimitive and magic medicine held a more prominent place than medical\r\ninstruments in the exhibits and collections. In 1905, Flint issued his\r\nlast, known, literary contribution, \"Directions for Collecting\r\nInformation and Objects Illustrating the History of Medicine,\" in Part S\r\nof _Bulletin of the U.S. National Museum_, no. 39. The emphasis he put\r\nupon this shows Dr. Flint's interest in collecting medical and\r\npharmaceutical objects and equipment of historical value. Consequently,\r\nhe arranged new exhibits including one on American Indian medicine. A\r\nmedical historian, Fielding H. Garrison, inspected these about 1910 and,\r\nin his \"An Introduction to the History of Medicine,\" wrote of their\r\nnovelty and appeal. \"In the interesting exhibit of folk medicine in the\r\nNational Museum at Washington,\" he commented, \"a buckeye or horse\r\nchestnut (_Aesculus flavus_), an Irish potato, a rabbit's foot, a\r\nleather strap previously worn by a horse, and a carbon from an arc light\r\nare shown as sovereign charms against rheumatism. Other amulets in the\r\nWashington exhibit,\" he added, \"are the patella of a sheep and a ring\r\nmade out of a coffin nail (dug out of a graveyard) for cramps and\r\nepilepsy, a peony root to be carried in the pocket against insanity, and\r\nrare and precious stones for all and sundry diseases.\" It had been Dr.\r\nFlint's intention, besides presenting an educational display on the\r\nhistory of the medical arts, to warn the public against the perils of\r\nquackery and the faults of folk medicine, as well as to expose evils in\r\ndrug adulteration. Today, we can see actual fulfillment of these\r\nintentions in the present exhibit at the medical gallery which has been\r\nexecuted recently on the basis of scientific, historical research.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Flint's retirement from the Smithsonian Institution in 1912,\r\nthere was no replacement for over five years. Therefore, the Division\r\nof Medicine was placed, for administrative purposes, under the\r\nsupervision of the curator of the newly reestablished (1912) Division of\r\nTextiles, Frederick L. Lewton. During these years, he fought against the\r\ndispersal of the medical and _materia medica_ collections. Thus, for\r\nlack of a curator of its own, almost all new activities in the Division\r\nof Medicine were curtailed until 1917.\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 1917, Lewton addressed members of the American\r\nPharmaceutical Association inviting them to cooperate in gathering up\r\nand preserving at the National Museum the \"many unique and irreplaceable\r\nobjects\" connected with the early history of pharmacy in this country\r\nwhich could still be saved.[10] Then, on March 14, 1917, an examination\r\nwas announced by the Civil Service (held May 2) for an assistant curator\r\nfor the Division of Medicine, and the position was filled by Joseph\r\nDonner on August 16, 1917. Donner was the first full-time employee paid\r\nby the Smithsonian Institution for the curatorship of this Division. He\r\nheld the post until January 31, 1918, when he was inducted into the\r\nSanitary Corps of the United States Army. No significant activities in\r\nthe Division of Medicine were reported during these few months.\r\n\r\nMr. Donner was followed by a second, full-time, museum officer who\r\npromoted a great amount of good will towards the Division during his\r\ncuratorship of a little over 30 years. Dr. Charles Whitebread\r\n(1877-1963), the first pharmacist to head the Division, joined the\r\nSmithsonian in 1918 and remained until his retirement in 1948, the\r\nlongest service, thus far, of any individual in the Division.\r\n\r\nDr. Whitebread received his degree of Doctor of Pharmacy from the School\r\nof Pharmacy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in\r\n1911. He entered government service late in 1915, but it was not until\r\nApril 2, 1918, that he agreed to become assistant curator of the\r\nDivision of Medicine.\r\n\r\nCurator Whitebread's first year was an active and challenging one, for\r\nin this new position he began to develop a deep interest in the history\r\nof the healing arts. He made a number of important acquisitions, most of\r\nthem pertaining to pharmaceutical products, synthetic chemicals and\r\ncrude drugs. He found that many specimens from the older drug\r\ncollections had deteriorated to such an extent as to be worthless, and\r\nhe began replacing them with freshly marketed drugs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--CURATOR CHARLES WHITEBREAD inspecting, with\r\nadmiration, five drug containers from the Squibb collection (1945).\r\n(_Photo courtesy of the American Pharmaceutical Association._)]\r\n\r\nPlans were completed for the opening of new medical exhibits and\r\nadopting, with some modifications and additions, earlier classifications\r\nset by Dr. Flint. Dr. Whitebread grouped these into the following\r\nclasses: the evaluation of the healing arts; a picture display of\r\nmedical men prominent in American history;[11] a _materia medica_\r\ndisplay including the history of pharmacy; and an exhibition on\r\nSanitation and Public Hygiene[12] which was later to evolve into the\r\nHall of Health.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, Dr. Whitebread added a number of specimens of medical-dosage\r\nforms and pharmaceutical preparations to the Division's collections. He\r\nalso acquired other gifts to complete existing exhibits illustrating the\r\nbasic principles of the various schools of medicine, such as homeopathy\r\nand osteopathy--their methods, tools, and ways of thought.\r\n\r\nIn 1921, a tablet machine by the Arthur Colton Company of Detroit,\r\nMichigan, was acquired, and an exhibit illustrating vaccine and serum\r\ntherapy was installed in the medical gallery. This was followed, in\r\n1922, by a collection arranged to tell the story of the prevention and\r\ncure of specific diseases by means of biological remedies.\r\n\r\nDuring the following two years, two more exhibits related to hospital\r\nsupplies and sanitation were added to the rapidly developing Hall of\r\nHealth exhibition which was opened in 1924. A third exhibit in 1925\r\nconsisted of 96 mounted color transparencies illustrating services\r\nprovided by hospitals to promote public health. Plans for the further\r\ndevelopment of the Hall of Health continued during 1926, and contacts\r\nwere made with organizations interested in the educational aspects of\r\nthe healing arts. As a result, several new exhibits were added. In 1926,\r\nthe American Optometric Association helped in the installation of an\r\nexhibit on conservation of vision or the care of the eyes under the\r\nslogan \"Save your vision,\" as a phase of health work. Other exhibits in\r\nthe Hall at this time were: what parasites are; water pollution and how\r\nto obtain pure water; waste disposal; ventilation and healthy housing,\r\nand the importance of recreation; purification of milk and how to obtain\r\npure milk; transmission of diseases by insects and animals; how life\r\nbegins; prenatal and postnatal care and preschool care; duties of the\r\npublic health nurse; and social, oral and mental hygiene.\r\n\r\nWith the acquiring of more medical appliances and the widening of the\r\nscope of the exhibits, more and more space was needed, and attention was\r\nturned to the area of the medical gallery which had been occupied by the\r\n_materia medica_ collection for almost four decades. To gain more\r\nexhibit space, it was decided that the greater part of the crude drugs\r\nshould be removed from the exhibits and be kept as a reference\r\ncollection and for research.[13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--EXHIBIT ON EGYPTIAN AND HEBREW MEDICINE,\r\ninstalled about 1924, which was illustrated by graphs and drugs\r\nmentioned in extant records of this ancient period. (Smithsonian photo\r\n30796-C.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--EXHIBIT ON MEDICAL HISTORY during the\r\nGreco-Roman period. (Smithsonian photo 30796-D.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--EXHIBIT ON REMEDIES DERIVED FROM DRUGS of\r\nvegetable origin, displayed about mid-1930's. (Smithsonian photo\r\n30439.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1926, original patent models including those related to pharmacy,\r\nmedicine, and dentistry, were transferred from the U.S. Patent Office to\r\nthe National Museum. These patent models, together with other apothecary\r\ntools and the machines used in drug production took up most of the\r\navailable space. This unfortunate situation led Dr. Whitebread to turn\r\ndown significant medical and pharmaceutical collections offered the\r\nMuseum between 1927 and 1930. Since the patent models were devised for\r\ninventions designed to simplify the practice of the health professions,\r\nthree cases of these models were displayed in the medical gallery in the\r\nearly 1930's. Other exhibits shown during this decade included the\r\ndeception of folk medicine with warnings against superstitions, and an\r\nexhibition on osteopathy,[14] as well as dioramas on the manufacture of\r\nmedicines and their use in scientific medical treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Dr. Whitebread was an active contributor to the\r\nliterature of the health field in various periodicals, as well as in\r\npamphlets issued by the Museum and other governmental agencies (see\r\nbibliography). His literary contributions, guided by the exhibits he\r\ndesigned and the collections he acquired, were focused on the Division's\r\ncollections, such as primitive and psychic medicine and warnings against\r\nreliance on magic and superstitions in treatment, medical oddities, and\r\nthe utilization of drugs of animal origin, both past and present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Medicine and Public Health (1939-1957)\r\n\r\nAfter taking charge of the Division of Medicine in 1918, Dr. Whitebread\r\ngave special attention to public health displays. His activities in this\r\narea were accelerated after 1924 when the health exhibit at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution was inaugurated. As the exhibits in this field\r\nincreased, the Division, in 1939, took the more comprehensive title of\r\nDivision of Medicine and Public Health. Also, in 1939, Dr. Whitebread\r\nwas promoted to the rank of associate curator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--EXHIBIT ON METHODS OF TREATMENT of diseases\r\nthrough mental impressions and psychic conditions as displayed about\r\n1925. (Smithsonian photo 30796-B.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--AN EXHIBIT ON SUPERSTITIONS, EMPIRICISM,\r\nmagic, and faith healing in the light of scientific medicine, completed\r\nin 1962, is in sharp contrast with that shown in figure 9.]\r\n\r\nHe continued his efforts to collect more specimens of interest to\r\nmedical history and to contribute to the literature. Among exhibited\r\nspecimens in 1941 were a powder paper-crimping machine, a portable drug\r\ncrusher, an odd device for spreading plaster on cloth, a pill-coating\r\napparatus, various suppository molds, a lozenge cutter, and an ingenious\r\nSeidlitz powder machine. The derivation of medicinal drugs from animal,\r\nvegetable, and mineral sources was also depicted, as were synthetic\r\nmaterials and their intermediates. Basic prescription materials were\r\ndisplayed, and rows of glass-enclosed cases held samples of crude\r\nbotanical drugs from almost every part of the globe with explanatory\r\ncards giving brief, concise descriptions. The exhibition provided\r\nmedical and pharmaceutical students about to take state-board\r\nexaminations, the opportunity to study the subject in detail, especially\r\nthe enormous collection of _materia medica_ samples.[15] Also in 1941,\r\nEli Lilly and Company donated an exhibit on the medical treatment of\r\nvarious types of anemia. In the same year, a diorama including a\r\nhypochlorinator for purification of water on a farm was installed in the\r\ngallery. In 1942, the first Emerson iron lung (developed in 1931 by John\r\nHaven Emerson) for artificial respiration was acquired by the Division.\r\nThe Division acquired, in 1944, the first portable x-ray machine known\r\nto have been operated successfully on the battlefield, as well as other\r\nx-ray equipment and early medicine chests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--OLD PUBLIC HEALTH EXHIBITION installed in the\r\ngallery about 1924. (Smithsonian photo 19952.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--THE HALL OF HEALTH, reestablished and opened\r\nin November 1957. (Smithsonian photo 44931.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--EARLY EXHIBIT ON HOMEOPATHY showing its\r\nhistory, methods and remedies which was installed about 1929.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 27049.)]\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the most outstanding accession in the field of\r\npharmaceutical history during Dr. Whitebread's years of service was the\r\nacquisition of the E. R. Squibb and Sons old apothecary shop. Most of\r\nthe baroque fixtures, including the stained-glass windows with\r\nHessian-Nassau coats of arms and wrought-iron frames, were part of the\r\nmid-18th-century cathedral pharmacy \"Münster Apotheke\" in Freiburg im\r\nBreisgau, Germany. It was offered for sale in September 1930 by Dr. Jo\r\nMayer of Wiesbaden, Germany, who was an enthusiastic collector of\r\nantiques, especially those related to the health professions. Earlier\r\nthat year, a historian of pharmacy and chemistry, Fritz Ferchl of\r\nMittenwald, Germany, had published a series of scholarly and informative\r\narticles on the Meyer collection in which the outstanding specimens were\r\nbeautifully portrayed and thoroughly described (see bibliography).\r\n\r\nAs a result of Dr. Mayer's efforts to sell his collection, the impact of\r\nFerchl's illustrated articles, and the uniqueness of the collection, E.\r\nR. Squibb and Sons purchased it in 1932 and brought it to the United\r\nStates \"with the thought that it would provide for American pharmacy,\r\nits teachers and students, a museum illuminating the history, growth,\r\nand development of pharmacy, its interesting background and struggle\r\nthrough the ages.\" It was displayed at the Century of Progress\r\nexposition held in Chicago during 1933 and 1934; subsequently, it was\r\nassembled in the Squibb Building in New York City as a private museum\r\nwhere, for about 10 years, it was visited by many interested in\r\npharmacy, ceramics, and art. Charles H. LaWall, who was originally\r\nengaged to prepare a descriptive catalog on the exhibit, gave it the\r\ntitle \"The Squibb Ancient Pharmacy.\"\r\n\r\nLate in 1943, E. R. Squibb and Sons offered the collection as a gift to\r\nthe American Pharmaceutical Association if the latter would provide\r\nmuseum space for it. The offer was accepted, but the Association\r\nfinally found it difficult to spare the needed space for the collection\r\nand decided to take up the matter with the U.S. National Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--THIS EARLY EXHIBIT ON OSTEOPATHY was\r\nrenovated several times prior to the early 1940's. (Smithsonian photo\r\n19250.)]\r\n\r\nAt this point, it should be stated that since 1883 the members of the\r\nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association have been keenly interested in\r\nhaving the National Museum serve as the custodian for all collected\r\nobjects and records of historical interest to pharmacy. In 1944, the\r\nAssociation officially offered to deposit on permanent loan, the\r\nSquibb's pharmacy collection in the Smithsonian Institution with the\r\nunderstanding that a suitable place would be provided for prompt and\r\npermanent display. The offer was accepted, and during April and May of\r\n1945, the entire collection was transferred to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, and construction to recreate the original two rooms for the\r\nold, 18th-century, European \"Apotheke\" was underway.\r\n\r\nBy August 1946, the exhibit was completed. In the large room where the\r\npharmacist met his customers, the shelves were filled with 15th-to\r\n19th-century, European pharmaceutical antiques. These included\r\nRenaissance mortars; 16th-and 17th-century nested weights; beautiful\r\nItalian, French, Swiss, and German majolica and faience drug jars; Dutch\r\nand English delft; drug containers made of flint or opal glass with\r\nfused-enamel labels with alchemical symbols; rare, 16th-century, wooden\r\ndrug containers, each with the coat of arms of the city in which each\r\nwas made; and two glass-topped, display tables contained franchises\r\nissued and signed by Popes or state rulers, medical edicts,\r\ndispensatories, herbals, pharmacopoeias, and pharmaceutical utensils.\r\n\r\nOn the walls in the small laboratory room, which also had been used as a\r\nworkshop and a study, were a stuffed crocodile, shark's head, tortoise,\r\nfish, and salamander, parts of which were utilized as remedial agents.\r\nTheir presence provided tangible evidence that the pharmacy dispensed\r\ngenuine drugs and not substitutes.\r\n\r\nThe pharmaceutical profession in this country hailed the outstanding\r\nexhibition, and the November 1946 issue of the _Journal of the American\r\nPharmaceutical Association, Practical Pharmacy Edition_, devoted its\r\nfront cover to depicting one corner of the study and laboratory room of\r\nthe shop.[16] Also, in a letter dated January 2, 1947, addressed to Dr.\r\nAlexander Wetmore, then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr.\r\nRobert P. Fischelis, the secretary of the American Pharmaceutical\r\nAssociation, considered the completion of the deposited exhibition a\r\ntriumph and \"as one of the highlights of the accomplishments of the\r\nAssociation in 1946.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--LATE 16TH-CENTURY, wooden drug container with\r\ncoat-of-arms, in the Squibb collection. The inscription _Ungula Alcis_\r\n(the hoof of the elk) suggests a superstitious attitude in medical\r\npractice and the wide use of animal organs in medical treatment.\r\n(_Courtesy of the American Pharmaceutical Association._)]\r\n\r\nFrom 1946 to 1948, the Division's collection was further enriched with\r\na number of historical specimens, among which was a \"grosse Flamme\"\r\nx-ray machine with induction-coil tube and stand developed by Albert B.\r\nKoett. It is one of the earliest American-made machines of its kind,\r\nproducing a 12-inch spark, the largest usable at that time with\r\n180,000-volt capacity, and a forerunner of later autotransformers. Other\r\naccessions included two 19th-century drug mills, an electric belt used\r\nin quackery, two medicine chests, three sets of Hessian crucibles used\r\nin a pioneer drugstore in Colorado, a drunkometer, mineral ores, and\r\npurely produced chemical elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--A RARE, ANTWERP, 16th-century drug jar in the\r\nSquibb collection deposited by the American Pharmaceutical Association.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1948, Associate Curator Whitebread retired after 30\r\nyears of service with the U.S. National Museum. He was a pioneer in the\r\nfield of health museums and during his curatorship had developed a\r\nmoribund section into a Division of field-wide importance. Dr.\r\nWhitebread was succeeded by George S. Thomas, also a pharmacist, who\r\nserved as associate curator from August 1948 until early 1952.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--THE APOTHECARY SHOP as seen in the Arts and\r\nIndustries building (1946-1964). (_Courtesy of the American\r\nPharmaceutical Association._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--VIEW OF THE LABORATORY AND STUDY ROOM of the\r\napothecary shop. On the left, the German-Swiss bronze mortar and pestle\r\n(1686) sign and above it an 18th-century German painting on canvas of\r\nChrist, \"the apothecary of the soul.\" The drug containers represent \"the\r\nfruits of the spirit,\" faith, patience, charity, etc., and the scales\r\nrepresent justice. Underneath is the verse from Matthew, 11:28, \"Come\r\nunto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you\r\nrest.\" (_Courtesy of the American Pharmaceutical Association._)]\r\n\r\nDuring his almost-three and a half years of service, Thomas acquired\r\nhearing-aid appliances from which he designed an exhibit on the\r\ndevelopment of these aids, surgical sutures, early samples of\r\nAureomycin, and a static-electricity machine made by Henkel about 1840.\r\nHe also published three short articles under the title, \"Now and Then,\"\r\nin the _National Capital Pharmacist_ (1950), no. 1, pp. 8-9; no. 2, pp.\r\n18-19, 29; and no. 3, pp. 15-16. In early 1952, Dr. Arthur O. Morton\r\npresented to the Division, a Swiss-made keratometer which he had\r\npurchased in 1907, and it is believed to be one of the first used in the\r\nUnited States to measure the curves of the cornea.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of the Division reached their highest point, thus far,\r\nin significantly increasing the national collection, as well as in\r\ncontributing to the scientific, historical, and professional literature,\r\nunder the curatorships of George B. Griffenhagen (December 8, 1952, to\r\nJune 27, 1959) and John B. Blake (July 1, 1957, to September 2, 1961).\r\nTheir reorganization of exhibits and collections, their competence and\r\nindustry, fulfilled the hopes, plans, and purposes laid down by earlier\r\ncurators for the Division.\r\n\r\nImmediately after assuming the responsibilities of the Division and\r\nthroughout 1953, Mr. Griffenhagen (M.S. in pharmaceutical chemistry from\r\nthe University of Southern California) undertook to develop the\r\ncollections still further. He increased the emphasis not only on\r\nhistorical pharmacy, but also on medicine, surgery, and dentistry. He\r\nalso renovated the exhibits in the medical gallery.\r\n\r\nIn 1954, several antibiotics were donated to the Division including a\r\nmold of _Penicillium notatum_ prepared and presented to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution by Sir Alexander Fleming (1881-1955), the discoverer of\r\npenicillium (1929), and a few Petri dishes used by botanist Benjamin M.\r\nDaggar who, while working for Lederle Laboratories, developed Aureomycin\r\n(chlortetracycline) in 1948. The Forest D. Dodrill--G.M.R. mechanical\r\nheart (1952), the first machine reported to be used successfully for the\r\ncomplete bypass of one side of the human heart during a surgical\r\noperation,[17] was presented to the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1955, the Division acquired one of the earliest\r\nEinthoven string galvanometers (named after the Dutch physiologist Willem\r\nEinthoven, 1860-1927) made in the United States in 1914 by Charles F.\r\nHindle for an electrocardiograph. Also added to the Division's\r\ncollections was the electrocardiograph used by Dr. Frank E. Wilson of\r\nthe United States, a pioneer educator in this field. Two temporary\r\nexhibits on allergy and surgical dressings were installed in the\r\ngallery. In the same year, Curator Griffenhagen published _Early\r\nAmerican Pharmacies_, a catalog on 28 pharmacy restorations in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn 1956, among many publications of interest in the fields of medical\r\nand pharmaceutical history, was Curator Griffenhagen's _Pharmacy\r\nMuseum_, with a foreword by Laurence V. Coleman, who termed it a useful\r\ncatalog and \"a good reflection of the history of the museum movement at\r\nlarge.\" A third x-ray tube of Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen (1845-1922) was\r\nadded to the collection in 1957 as well as a complete set of\r\nhospital-ward fixtures of about 1900 from the Massachusetts General\r\nHospital, rare patent medicines, 18th-century microscopes, and a\r\n13th-century mortar and pestle made in Persia.\r\n\r\nIn 1957, Mr. Griffenhagen published a series of illustrated articles in\r\nthe _Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association, Practical\r\nPharmacy Edition_, which were later reprinted by the Association in a\r\nbooklet entitled, _Tools of the Apothecary_. In it, he described several\r\npharmaceutical specimens in the collection and their place in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of Medical Sciences (1957 to Present)\r\n\r\nThe U.S. National Museum was reorganized on July 1, 1957, into two\r\nunits, the Natural History Museum and the Museum of History and\r\nTechnology. At the same time, and in view of the widening scope of the\r\nDivision, its more scientifically based planning, and the constantly\r\nincreasing collection with equal emphasis on all branches of the healing\r\narts, the Division's title was changed to the Division of Medical\r\nSciences--the title it still bears in 1964. With the reorganization, the\r\nDepartment of Engineering and Industries, under which the Division fell\r\nadministratively, was renamed the Department of Science and Technology\r\nof the Museum of History and Technology. It was also the first time\r\nsince its establishment in 1881 that the Division had two curators, for\r\non July 1, 1957, Dr. John B. Blake joined the staff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--CURATORS JOHN B. BLAKE AND GEORGE\r\nGRIFFENHAGEN examine the newly acquired (1957) electromagnetic,\r\nMorton-Wimshurst-Holz Influence Machine. It was manufactured by the\r\nBowen Company of Providence, Rhode Island (1889). With the discovery of\r\nx-ray, it was used for making x-ray photographs until early in the 20th\r\ncentury.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of these changes, the Division was subdivided into a Section\r\nof Pharmaceutical History and Health and a Section of Medical and Dental\r\nHistory. The former was planned to encompass the collections of _materia\r\nmedica_, pharmaceutical equipment, and all material related to the\r\nhistory of pharmacy, toxicology, pharmacology, and biochemistry, as well\r\nas the Hall of Health which was opened November 2, 1957, and which\r\nemphasizes man's progressing knowledge of his body and the functions of\r\nits major organs.[18] The latter Section was planned to include all that\r\nbelongs to the development of surgery, medicine, dentistry, and nursing,\r\nespecially in relation to hospitals.\r\n\r\nIn October 1957, the Division acquired a collection of rare, ceramic,\r\ndrug jars which included two, 13th-century, North Syrian and Persian,\r\nalbarello-shaped, majolica jars; a 15th-century, Hispano-Moresque drug\r\ncontainer; and a 16th-century, Italian faience, dragon-spout ewer.\r\nDuring the following two years, Curator Griffenhagen periodically toured\r\nmuseums and medical and pharmaceutical institutions in this country,\r\nSouth America, and Europe gathering specimens and information for the\r\nDivision and for publication, respectively. However, on June 27, 1959,\r\nhe resigned his curatorship to join the staff of the American\r\nPharmaceutical Association in Washington, D.C. Dr. Blake became the\r\ncurator in charge of the Division and Mr. Griffenhagen was succeeded on\r\nSeptember 24, 1959, by the author of this paper as associate curator in\r\ncharge of the Section of Pharmaceutical History and Health.\r\n\r\nDr. Blake, as curator of the Section of Medical and Dental History,\r\nacquired a large number of valuable and varied specimens for the\r\nDivision's collections. They included optometric refracting instruments,\r\nan early 1920's General Electric, portable, x-ray machine, the Charles\r\nA. Lindbergh and Alexis Carrel pump (designed in 1935 to perfuse\r\nlife-sustaining fluids to the organs of the body), the Sewell heart pump\r\n(1950) to control delivery of air pressure and suction to the pumping\r\nmechanism, and a large and valuable collection of dental equipment\r\nformerly at the universities of Pennsylvania and Illinois. Dr. Blake\r\nwrote the explanatory material and supervised the design and production\r\nof the majority of exhibits in the renovated hall of medical and dental\r\nhistory. He also contributed several scholarly articles and a book (see\r\nbibliography) on the history of the healing arts and public health in\r\nparticular. He resigned on September 2, 1961, to join the staff of the\r\nNational Library of Medicine as chief of the History of Medicine\r\nDivision, and was succeeded by the author as curator of the Division.\r\nFrom the summer of 1962 to April 1964, the Division benefited from the\r\nexpert advice of Dr. Alfred R. Henderson as consultant in the\r\npreparation and designing of the surgical and medical exhibits of the\r\nMuseum of History and Technology.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 1961 to May 1964, the Division's collections\r\nexpanded greatly through its medical, dental, and pharmaceutical\r\nacquisitions. Specimens of antiques acquired from 1961 through 1963\r\nnumbered up to 1,539 and included gifts from leading institutions and\r\nindividual philanthropists. The scope of these gifts and acquisitions\r\nranges from electronic resuscitators, microscopes, x-ray equipment, and\r\nspectacles, to patent medicines, amulets, apothecary tools, dental\r\ninstruments, and office material of practitioners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--EXHIBIT ON SPECTACLES, LORGNETTES,\r\nOPTOMETERS, and refraction, completed in 1960. It features a cross\r\nsection of the Division's large collection of eyeglasses. (Smithsonian\r\nphoto 47943-D.)]\r\n\r\nIn the last decade, the interest in the national endeavor for promoting\r\nresearch and scholarship in the history of medicine has increased\r\ngreatly. It was most appropriate, therefore, for the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution to play host on May 2 for two sessions of the 37th annual\r\nmeeting of the American Association for the History of Medicine held in\r\nthe Washington, D.C., area from April 30 through May 2, 1964. In\r\nwelcoming the members to the morning session in the auditorium of the\r\nnew Museum of History and Technology, Frank A. Taylor, director of the\r\nUnited States National Museum, expressed the feeling that the meeting of\r\nthe Association was, in a sense, a dedication of the new auditorium and\r\nan opportunity for the Smithsonian to reaffirm its deep interest and\r\ncommitment in fostering research and furthering the appreciation of\r\nscholarly endeavor in the history of the healing arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA New Dimension For the Healing Arts\r\n\r\n\"One day the United States will have a National Museum of science,\r\nengineering, and industry, as most large nations have.\" This was the\r\nprediction made in 1946 by the director of the U.S. National Museum, Mr.\r\nFrank A. Taylor, then curator of the Division of Engineering.[19] It was\r\nin 1963, that the new $36,000,000 building of the Museum of History\r\nand Technology was completed, and opened to the public in 1964. The\r\noffices of the Division of Medical Sciences as well as the reference and\r\nstudy collections were moved to the fifth floor of the new building. The\r\nexhibits, however, will be displayed in the gallery at the southwest\r\ncorner of the first floor. These exhibits, it is hoped, will show a new\r\ndimension and an unprecedented approach in displaying the development of\r\nthe healing arts throughout the ages and the instruments and equipment\r\nassociated with health professions. They also present the expanding\r\nobjectives and plans of the Division's growth as an integral part of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. Conveniently, the exhibits form four, closely\r\nconnected halls in one large gallery which will be open to the public in\r\nthe summers of 1965 to 1966.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--EXHIBIT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLOOD-PRESSURE\r\nINSTRUMENTS and the early 20th-century sphygmomanometers which was\r\ncompleted in 1960. (Smithsonian photo 47943-M.)]\r\n\r\n1. THE HALL OF HEALTH displays models and graphic and historical exhibit\r\nmaterials to demonstrate the function of the various healthy organs of\r\nthe human body. The main topics emphasized are: embryology and\r\nchildbirth; tooth structure; the heart and blood circulation;\r\nrespiration; the endocrine glands; kidneys and the urinary-excretory\r\nsystem; the brain and the nervous system; the ear; and vision and the\r\nuse of eyeglasses.\r\n\r\nThe most appreciated exhibit of all in this Hall is the \"transparent\r\nwoman\" figure which rotates, automatically, every 15 minutes with a\r\nrecorded message describing the function of each major organ of the body\r\nat the same time that the organ is electronically lighted, so that the\r\nviewer can see its place in the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--HEARING-AID EXHIBIT designed in 1962. It\r\nincludes otologist Julius Lempert's personal memorabilia and original\r\nsurgical instruments used in the fenestration operation for restoring\r\nhearing. (Smithsonian photo 49345-C.)]\r\n\r\n2. THE HALL OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY will depict the history of these\r\ntwo sciences with exhibits of the equipment used through the centuries.\r\nIn the medical field, early trephining and other surgical instruments\r\nwill be displayed along with a diorama of an 1805 surgical operation\r\nperformed by Dr. Philip Syng Physick in the amphitheater of the\r\nPennsylvania Hospital. Diagnostic instruments such as stethoscopes,\r\nendoscopes, speculums, and blood-pressure measuring devices will be\r\nexhibited with a series of microscopes illustrating the development of\r\nthese instruments. Exhibits of original galvanometers and other\r\napparatus will trace the development of cardiography. The early use of\r\nanesthesia will be shown by apparatus of William Morton and Crawford W.\r\nLong, American pioneers in this field. The development of the devices of\r\nmodern medicine and surgery will be shown by exhibits of the iron lung\r\nand x-ray tubes, including a tube used by W. K. Roentgen. Medicine\r\nchests and surgical kits of different periods will graphically summarize\r\nthe state of medical science in the period each represents.\r\n\r\nExhibits on the development of dentistry and dental surgery will display\r\nexamples of tooth-filling and extracting tools, drilling apparatus from\r\nthe early hand and foot engines to the first ultrasonic cutting\r\ninstrument (1954), and the original contra-angle, hydraulic and\r\nair-turbine handpiece model[20] which revolutionized the field of\r\ninstrumentation for dental surgery (with speeds of 200,000 to 400,000\r\nrpm). This hydraulic turbine of Dr. Robert J. Nelson and associates of\r\nthe National Bureau of Standards set the design pattern for the\r\nremarkable and successful high-speed, air-turbine handpiece developed by\r\nPaul H. Tanner and Oscar P. Nagel of the U.S. Naval Dental School in\r\n1956. Also underway is the reconstruction of the offices of famous\r\ndentists such as G. V. Black and the father of American orthodontia,\r\nEdward H. Angle, using their original equipment and instruments. In\r\naddition, an exhibit is planned to include x-ray tubes and the electric\r\ndental engine, the first to be operated in a human mouth by the pioneer\r\ndentist on dental skiagraphy, Charles E. Kells (1856-1928).[21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--EXHIBIT ON NURSING BOTTLES and measures to\r\npromote child health to counteract the once-common diseases of\r\nchildhood. This display was completed in 1962. (Smithsonian photo\r\n49345-G.)]\r\n\r\n3. THE HALL OF PHARMACEUTICAL HISTORY will feature exhibits on the\r\nreconstruction of two pharmacy shops: an 18th-century apothecary shop,\r\noriginally from Germany, with a very elegant collection of drug jars,\r\ndecorated medicinal bottles, balances, mortars and pestles, and other\r\ntools and documents pertaining to the apothecary art, and a late\r\n19th-century American drugstore with shelves filled with patent\r\nmedicines and drug containers of various sizes and shapes. The window\r\nwill also feature symbols of pharmacy and beautiful show globes.\r\nDisplays will show the development of antibiotics and the early tools\r\nused in the manufacture of the so-called \"miracle drugs,\" including a\r\nmold from Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. In\r\naddition, a platform will be reconstructed to display a variety of\r\npharmaceutical apparatus used in the preparation and manufacture of\r\ndrugs, such as tablet and capsule machines and drug mills and\r\npercolators. Recently, with the assistance of Professor Glenn\r\nSonnedecker, the Division acquired a fine collection of pharmaceutical\r\nequipment and devices from the School of Pharmacy of the University of\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--THE ORIGINS OF DRUGS from the three natural\r\nkingdoms, drug synthesis, and the increase in the manufacture of\r\nvitamins. This display was completed in 1962 and is now on display at\r\nthe Museum of History and Technology. (Smithsonian photo P6316.)]\r\n\r\nSince the Division houses the largest collection of _materia medica_ in\r\nthe country, a representative cross section of crude drugs will be\r\ndisplayed in alphabetical order as well as a display illustrating the\r\nrole of cinchona and antimalarial drugs in the fight against disease. An\r\nexhibit will portray the \"origin of drugs\" from the three natural\r\nkingdoms, animal, vegetable, and mineral, together with synthetic drugs\r\nincluding the manufacture of vitamins.\r\n\r\nPlans are being made for an elaborate exhibit of weights and balances\r\nused in many countries throughout the centuries, their impact on\r\naccuracy of dosage and weighing of drugs, and their use in the\r\napothecary art.\r\n\r\nThe Division will also display pictorial and printed materials, as well\r\nas artifacts from all periods and all countries. These collections are\r\nintended to help in presenting a more complete picture of the story of\r\nthe medical sciences for educational purposes and research, and to\r\nincrease man's knowledge in fighting disease and promoting health.\r\n\r\nThus, from a few hundred specimens of crude drugs in the Section of\r\nMateria Medica of 83 years ago, there has developed a Museum Division\r\ntoday which embraces the evolution of the health professions through the\r\nages. This Division now has the largest collection in the Western\r\nHemisphere of historical objects which are related to the healing arts.\r\nThe reference collections are available to the researcher and scholar,\r\nand the exhibits are intended for pleasure and educational purposes in\r\nthese fields. The plans for expansion have no limitation as we keep pace\r\nwith man's progress in the medical sciences and continue to collect\r\nmaterials that contributed to the historical development in the fight\r\nagainst diseases and the attempts to secure better health for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] _Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution for the Year 1882_ [hereinafter referred to as the\r\n_Smithsonian Annual Report_], pp. 101-103; and introductory\r\n\"advertisement\" to the lectures published by the Smithsonian Institution\r\nin its Miscellaneous Collections (see bibliography).\r\n\r\n[2] Dr. J. J. Woodward's lecture explained the progress of medical\r\nknowledge of morbid growth and cancerous tumors from 1865 to 1872. It\r\ncautioned that uncertain methods of diagnosis at that time allowed\r\ncharlatans and uneducated practitioners to report cures of cancer in\r\ninstances where nonmalignant growths were \"removed by their caustic\r\npastes and plasters.\"\r\n\r\n[3] The two longest intervals were in preparing the last two lectures:\r\nthe ninth in 1884, and the tenth, 1889. Both came after the\r\nestablishment in 1881 of the Section of Materia Medica in the U.S.\r\nNational Museum, to display the development and progress of the health\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\n[4] _Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy for the year 1883_, pp.\r\n190, 614-615.\r\n\r\n[5] For classifying chemical compounds, Dr. Flint relied on the work of\r\nH. E. Roscoe and C. Schorlemmez, _A Treatise on Chemistry_, 2 vols. (New\r\nYork: D. Appleton, 1878-1800.)\r\n\r\n[6] _Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy for the year 1882_, vol.\r\n2, part 2, pp. 100, 228, 656-657. Dr. Flint in his article \"Report on\r\nPharmacopoeias of All Nations,\" ibid., pp. 655-680, remarks that there\r\nwere then 19 official pharmacopoeias in the world, besides three\r\nsemiofficial formularies in certain localities in Italy. The\r\npharmacopoeias collected represent Austria, Belgium, France, Germany,\r\nGreat Britain, Greece, Holland, India, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Spain,\r\nSweden, Switzerland (two), and the United States.\r\n\r\n[7] The _Universal Formulary_, by R. Eglesfeld Griffith, first edited in\r\nMarch 1850 (3rd ed. rev. and enlarged by John M. Maisch, Philadelphia:\r\nLea, 1874) should not be considered an international drug standard. It\r\nwas mainly concerned with compiling a great number of formulas and\r\nrecipes, methods of preparing and administering official and other\r\nmedicines, and tables on weights and measures for utilization by the\r\nU.S. practitioners of the time.\r\n\r\n[8] Other elaborate arrangements were also made to improve and expand\r\nthe Section's activities and services, though some have never\r\nmaterialized. For example, a herbarium was suggested from which\r\nspecimens could be obtained for display of the actual drug with painted\r\npictures of its plant next to it. Consideration was given to displaying\r\nenlarged drawings to show the minute structure of the specimen for\r\nbetter identification. In addition, an exhibition of several 10-liter\r\nvessels of the most popular mineral waters was planned. The amount of\r\nsaline substances which analysis had shown to be present in each vessel\r\nwas to be listed in a table to be attached to that vessel, or the same\r\namount of minerals was to be put in a small bottle beside it. This plan\r\nwas carried out to the best advantage at the Cotton States and\r\nInternational Exposition held in 1895 in Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\n[9] HOLT, \"A Sketch of the Development of the Rockefeller Institute for\r\nMedical Research,\" p. 1. A similar comment was voiced by GALDSTON,\r\n\"Research in the United States,\" p. 366.\r\n\r\n[10] _Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association_ (1918), vol.\r\n7, pp. 376-377, 466.\r\n\r\n[11] Two decades later, Dr. Whitebread designed a panel showing\r\nphotographs of famous medical pioneers of all nationalities. See his\r\narticle, \"The Odd Origin of Medical Discoveries,\" p. 321.\r\n\r\n[12] GEBHARD, \"From Medicine Show to Health Museum,\" p. 579. The\r\noriginal plan for this Hall of Health was to feature exhibits on public\r\nhealth for popular educational purposes, including an illustrated\r\nexhibit on hospital care. See FOLEY, \"Smithsonian Institution Devotes\r\nMuch Space to Hospital Exhibit,\" pp. 43-44.\r\n\r\n[13] Lack of space notwithstanding, valuable accessions were added about\r\n1930, including a collection of early x-ray tubes and personal\r\nmemorabilia of Drs. William T. G. Morton (1819-1868), Crawford W. Long\r\n(1815-1878), and William Gorgas (1854-1920).\r\n\r\n[14] D. RILEY MOORE published a series of short reports under the title\r\n\"Committee on Osteopathic Exhibits in the U.S. National Museum,\" in the\r\n_Journal of the American Osteopathic Association_ (1933-1946), vols.\r\n33-46, regarding the exhibit on osteopathy.\r\n\r\n[15] [KLEIN], \"He Directs Pharmacy Exhibits at the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution,\" pp. 20-21.\r\n\r\n[16] Several other journals reported the exhibition with illustrations:\r\n_Drug Topics_ (July 8, 1946), vol. 90, no. 2, pp. 2, 79; _National\r\nCapital Pharmacist_ (September 1945), vol. 7, p. 11, and (September\r\n1946), vol. 8, pp. 11-13; and _The Scientific Monthly_ (November 1952),\r\nvol. 75, p. 268.\r\n\r\n[17] DODRILL, and others, \"Temporary Mechanical Substitution for the\r\nLeft Ventricle in Man,\" pp. 642-644, and \"Pulmonary Volvuloplasty under\r\nDirect Vision using the Mechanical Heart for a Complete Bypass of the\r\nRight Heart in a Patient with Congenital Pulmonary Stenosis,\" pp.\r\n584-595.\r\n\r\n[18] For the design, expert arrangement of the exhibits, and the legends\r\nthat accompany each exhibit in the Hall of Health, we are indebted to\r\nDrs.
