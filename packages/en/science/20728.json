Beam Piper]\r\n\r\n[Illustration][Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpace Viking\r\n\r\n\r\n            Vengeance is a strange human motivation--\r\n                 it can drive a man to do things\r\n     which he neither would nor could achieve without it ...\r\n         and because of that it lies behind some of the\r\n               greatest sagas of human literature!\r\n\r\n\r\nby H. Beam Piper\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\r\n\r\nThey stood together at the parapet, their arms about each other's\r\nwaists, her head against his cheek. Behind, the broad leaved\r\nshrubbery gossiped softly with the wind, and from the lower main\r\nterrace came music and laughing voices. The city of Wardshaven\r\nspread in front of them, white buildings rising from the wide spaces\r\nof green treetops, under a shimmer of sun-reflecting aircars above.\r\nFar away, the mountains were violet in the afternoon haze, and the\r\nhuge red sun hung in a sky as yellow as a ripe peach.\r\n\r\nHis eye caught a twinkle ten miles to the southwest, and for an\r\ninstant he was puzzled. Then he frowned. The sunlight on the two\r\nthousand-foot globe of Duke Angus' new ship, the _Enterprise_, back\r\nat the Gorram shipyards after her final trial cruise. He didn't want\r\nto think about that, now.\r\n\r\nInstead, he pressed the girl closer and whispered her name, \"Elaine,\"\r\nand then, caressing every syllable, \"Lady Elaine Trask of Traskon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Lucas!\" Her protest was half joking and half apprehensive.\r\n\"It's bad luck to be called by your married name before the wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been calling you that in my mind since the night of the Duke's\r\nball, when you were just home from school on Excalibur.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up from the corner of her eye.\r\n\r\n\"That was when I started calling me that, too,\" she confessed.\r\n\r\n\"There's a terrace to the west at Traskon New House,\" he told her.\r\n\"Tomorrow, we'll have our dinner there, and watch the sunset together.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I thought that was to be our sunset-watching place.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been peeking,\" he accused. \"Traskon New House was to be\r\nyour surprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I always was a present-peeker, New Year's and my birthdays. But I only\r\nsaw it from the air. I'll be very surprised at everything inside,\"\r\nshe promised. \"And very delighted.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when she'd seen everything and Traskon New House wasn't a surprise\r\nany more, they'd take a long space trip. He hadn't mentioned that to\r\nher, yet. To some of the other Sword-Worlds--Excalibur, of course, and\r\nMorglay and Flamberge and Durendal. No, not Durendal; the war had\r\nstarted there again. But they'd have so much fun. And she would see\r\nclear blue skies again, and stars at night. The cloud-veil hid the stars\r\nfrom Gram, and Elaine had missed them, since coming home from Excalibur.\r\n\r\nThe shadow of an aircar fell briefly upon them and they looked up\r\nand turned their heads, in time to see it sink with graceful dignity\r\ntoward the landing-stage of Karval House, and he glimpsed its\r\nblazonry--sword and atom-symbol, the badge of the ducal house of\r\nWard. He wondered if it were Duke Angus himself, or just some of\r\nhis people come ahead of him. They should get back to their guests,\r\nhe supposed. Then he took her in his arms and kissed her, and she\r\nresponded ardently. It must have been all of five minutes since\r\nthey'd done that before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA slight cough behind them brought them apart and their heads\r\naround. It was Sesar Karvall, gray-haired and portly, the breast of\r\nhis blue coat gleaming with orders and decorations and the sapphire\r\nin the pommel of his dress-dagger twinkling.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I'd find you two here,\" Elaine's father smiled. \"You'll\r\nhave tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow together, but need I remind\r\nyou that today we have guests, and more coming every minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who came in the Ward car?\" Elaine asked.\r\n\r\n\"Rovard Grauffis. And Otto Harkaman; you never met him, did you, Lucas?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not by introduction. I'd like to, before he spaces out.\" He had\r\nnothing against Harkaman personally; only against what he represented.\r\n\"Is the Duke coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, surely. Lionel of Newhaven and the Lord of Northport are coming\r\nwith him. They're at the Palace now.\" Karvall hesitated. \"His nephew's\r\nback in town.\"\r\n\r\nElaine was distressed; she started to say: \"Oh, dear! I hope he doesn't--\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Dunnan been bothering Elaine again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to take notice of. He was here, yesterday, demanding to\r\nspeak with her. We got him to leave without too much unpleasantness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be something for me to take notice of, if he keeps it up\r\nafter tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nFor his seconds and Andray Dunnan's, that was; he hoped it wouldn't\r\ncome to that. He didn't want to have to shoot a kinsman to the house\r\nof Ward, and a crazy man to boot.\r\n\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry for him,\" Elaine was saying. \"Father, you should\r\nhave let me talk to him. I might have made him understand.\"\r\n\r\nSesar Karvall was shocked. \"Child, you couldn't have subjected\r\nyourself to that! The man is insane!\" Then he saw her bare\r\nshoulders, and was even more shocked. \"Elaine, your shawl!\"\r\n\r\nHer hands went up and couldn't find it; she looked about in confused\r\nembarrassment. Amused, Lucas picked it from the shrub onto which she\r\nhad tossed it and draped it over her shoulders, his hands lingering\r\nbriefly. Then he gestured to the older man to precede them, and\r\nthey entered the arbored walk. At the other end, in an open circle,\r\na fountain played; white marble girls and boys bathing in the\r\njade-green basin. Another piece of loot from one of the Old Federation\r\nplanets; that was something he'd tried to avoid in furnishing\r\nTraskon New House. There'd be a lot of that coming to Gram, after\r\nOtto Harkaman took the _Enterprise_ to space.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to come back, some time, and visit them,\" Elaine\r\nwhispered to him. \"They'll miss me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll find a lot of new friends at your new home,\" he whispered\r\nback. \"You wait till tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to put a word in the Duke's ear about that fellow,\" Sesar\r\nKarvall, still thinking of Dunnan, was saying. \"If he speaks to him,\r\nmaybe it'll do some good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it. I don't think Duke Angus has any influence over him at all.\"\r\n\r\nDunnan's mother had been the Duke's younger sister; from his father\r\nhe had inherited what had originally been a prosperous barony. Now\r\nit was mortgaged to the top of the manor-house aerial-mast. The Duke\r\nhad once assumed Dunnan's debts, and refused to do so again. Dunnan\r\nhad gone to space a few times, as a junior officer on trade-and-raid\r\nvoyages into the Old Federation. He was supposed to be a fair\r\nastrogator. He had expected his uncle to give him command of the\r\n_Enterprise_, which had been ridiculous. Disappointed in that,\r\nhe had recruited a mercenary company and was seeking military\r\nemployment: It was suspected that he was in correspondence with\r\nhis uncle's worst enemy, Duke Omfray of Glaspyth.\r\n\r\nAnd he was obsessively in love with Elaine Karvall, a passion which\r\nseemed to nourish itself on its own hopelessness. Maybe it would\r\nbe a good idea to take that space trip right away. There ought to\r\nbe a ship leaving Bigglersport for one of the other Sword-Worlds,\r\nbefore long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey paused at the head of the escalators; the garden below was\r\nthronged with guests, the bright shawls of the ladies and the coats\r\nof the men making shifting color-patterns among the flower-beds and\r\non the lawns and under the trees. Serving-robots, flame-yellow and\r\nblack in the Karvall colors, floated about playing soft music and\r\noffering refreshments. There was a continuous spiral of changing\r\ncostume-color around the circular robo-table. Voices babbled happily\r\nlike a mountain river.\r\n\r\nAs they stood looking down, another aircar circled low; green and\r\ngold, lettered PANPLANET NEWS SERVICE. Sesar Karvall swore in\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't there use to be something they called privacy?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's a big story, Sesar.\"\r\n\r\nIt was; more than the marriage of two people who happened to be in love\r\nwith each other. It was the marriage of the farming and ranching barony\r\nof Traskon and the Karvall steel mills. More, it was public announcement\r\nthat the wealth and fighting-men of both baronies were now aligned\r\nbehind Duke Angus of Wardshaven. So it was a general holiday. Every\r\nindustry had closed down at noon today, and would be closed until\r\nmorning-after-next, and there would be dancing in every park and\r\nfeasting in every tavern. To Sword-Worlders, any excuse for a holiday\r\nwas better than none.\r\n\r\n\"They're our people, Sesar; they have a right to have a good time\r\nwith us. I know everybody at Traskon is watching this by screen.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand and waved to the news car, and when it swung\r\nits pickup around, he waved again. Then they went down the long\r\nescalator.\r\n\r\nLady Lavina Karvall was the center of a cluster of matrons and\r\ndowagers, around which tomorrow's bridesmaids fluttered like\r\nmany-colored butterflies. She took possession of her daughter\r\nand dragged her into the feminine circle. He saw Rovard Grauffis,\r\nsmall and saturnine, Duke Angus' henchman, and Burt Sandrasan,\r\nLady Lavina's brother. They spoke, and then an upper-servant,\r\nhis tabard blazoned with the yellow flame and black hammer of\r\nKarvall mills, approached his master with some tale of domestic\r\ncrisis, and the two went away together.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't met Captain Harkaman, Lucas,\" Rovard Grauffis said.\r\n\"I wish you'd come over and say hello and have a drink with him.\r\nI know your attitude, but he's a good sort. Personally, I wish\r\nwe had a few like him around here.\"\r\n\r\nThat was his main objection. There were fewer and fewer men of\r\nthat sort on any of the Sword-Worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nA dozen men clustered around the bartending robot--his cousin\r\nand family lawyer, Nikkolay Trask; Lothar Ffayle, the banker;\r\nAlex Gorram, the shipbuilder, and his son Basil; Baron Rathmore;\r\nmore of the Wardshaven nobles whom he knew only distantly.\r\nAnd Otto Harkaman.\r\n\r\nHarkaman was a Space Viking. That would have set him apart, even\r\nif he hadn't topped the tallest of them by a head. He wore a short\r\nblack jacket, heavily gold-braided, and black trousers inside\r\nankle-boots; the dagger on his belt was no mere dress-ornament. His\r\ntousled red-brown hair was long enough to furnish extra padding in\r\na combat-helmet, and his beard was cut square at the bottom.\r\n\r\nHe had been fighting on Durendal, for one of the branches of the\r\nroyal house contesting fratricidally for the throne. The wrong one;\r\nhe had lost his ship, and most of his men and, almost, his own life.\r\nHe had been a penniless refugee on Flamberge, owning only the\r\nclothes he stood in and his personal weapons and the loyalty of\r\nhalf a dozen adventurers as penniless as himself, when Duke Angus\r\nhad invited him to Gram to command the _Enterprise_.\r\n\r\n\"A pleasure, Lord Trask. I've met your lovely bride-to-be, and\r\nnow that I meet you, let me congratulate both.\" Then, as they\r\nwere having a drink together, he put his foot in it by asking:\r\n\"You're not an investor in the Tanith Adventure, are you?\"\r\n\r\nHe said he wasn't, and would have let it go at that. Young Basil\r\nGorram had to get his foot in, too.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Trask does not approve of the Tanith Adventure,\" he said\r\nscornfully. \"He thinks we should stay home and produce wealth,\r\ninstead of exporting robbery and murder to the Old Federation\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\nThe smile remained on Otto Harkaman's face; only the friendliness\r\nwas gone. He unobtrusively shifted his drink to his left hand.\r\n\r\n\"Well, our operations are definable as robbery and murder,\" he\r\nagreed. \"Space Vikings are professional robbers and murderers.\r\nAnd you object? Perhaps you find me personally objectionable?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have shaken your hand or had a drink with you if I did.\r\nI don't care how many planets you raid or cities you sack, or how\r\nmany innocents, if that's what they are, you massacre in the Old\r\nFederation. You couldn't possibly do anything worse than those\r\npeople have been doing to one another for the past ten centuries.\r\nWhat I object to is the way you're raiding the Sword-Worlds.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy!\" Basil Gorram exploded.\r\n\r\n\"Young man,\" Harkaman reproved, \"the conversation was between Lord\r\nTrask and myself. And when somebody makes a statement you don't\r\nunderstand, don't tell him he's crazy. Ask him what he means.\r\nWhat _do_ you mean, Lord Trask?\"\r\n\r\n\"You should know; you've just raided Gram for eight hundred of our\r\nbest men. You raided me for close to forty vaqueros, farm-workers,\r\nlumbermen, machine-operators, and I doubt I'll be able to replace\r\nthem with as good.\" He turned to the elder Gorram. \"Alex, how many\r\nhave you lost to Captain Harkaman?\"\r\n\r\nGorram tried to make it a dozen; pressed, he admitted to a score and\r\na half. Roboticians, machine-supervisors, programmers, a couple of\r\nengineers, a foreman. There was grudging agreement from the others.\r\nBurt Sandrasan's engine-works had lost almost as many, of the same\r\nkind. Even Lothar Ffayle admitted to losing a computerman and\r\na guard-sergeant.\r\n\r\nAnd after they were gone, the farms and ranches and factories would\r\ngo on, almost but not quite as before. Nothing on Gram, nothing on\r\nany of the Sword-Worlds, was done as efficiently as three centuries\r\nago. The whole level of Sword-World life was sinking, like the east\r\ncoastline of this continent, so slowly as to be evident only from\r\nthe records and monuments of the past. He said as much, and added:\r\n\r\n\"And the genetic loss. The best Sword-World genes are literally\r\nescaping to space, like the atmosphere of a low-gravity planet,\r\neach generation begotten by fathers slightly inferior to the last.\r\nIt wasn't so bad when the Space Vikings raided directly from the\r\nSword-Worlds; they got home once in a while. Now they're conquering\r\nplanets in the Old Federation for bases, and staying there.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverybody had begun to relax; this wouldn't be a quarrel. Harkaman,\r\nwho had shifted his drink back to his right hand, chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"That's right. I've fathered my share of brats in the Old\r\nFederation, and I know Space Vikings whose fathers were born on\r\nOld Federation planets.\" He turned to Basil Gorram. \"You see, the\r\ngentleman isn't crazy, at all. That's what happened to the Terran\r\nFederation, by the way. The good men all left to colonize, and the\r\nstuffed shirts and yes-men and herd-followers and safety-firsters\r\nstayed on Terra and tried to govern the galaxy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe this is all new to you, captain,\" Rovard Grauffis\r\nsaid sourly, \"but Lucas Trask's dirge for the Decline and Fall\r\nof the Sword-Worlds is an old song to the rest of us. I have\r\ntoo much to do to stay here and argue.\"\r\n\r\nLothar Ffayle evidently did intend to stay and argue.\r\n\r\n\"All you're saying, Lucas, is that we're expanding. You want us\r\nto sit here and build up population pressure like Terra in the\r\nFirst Century?\"\r\n\r\n\"With three and a half billion people spread out on twelve planets?\r\nThey had that many on Terra alone. And it took us eight centuries\r\nto reach that.\"\r\n\r\nThat had been since the Ninth Century, Atomic Era, at the end of\r\nthe Big War. Ten thousand men and women on Abigor, refusing to\r\nsurrender, had taken the remnant of the System States Alliance navy\r\nto space, seeking a world the Federation had never heard of and\r\nwouldn't find for a long time. That had been the world they had\r\ncalled Excalibur. From it, their grandchildren had colonized Joyeuse\r\nand Durendal and Flamberge; Haulteclere had been colonized in the\r\nnext generation from Joyeuse, and Gram from Haulteclere.\r\n\r\n\"We're not expanding, Lothar; we're contracting. We stopped\r\nexpanding three hundred and fifty years ago, when that ship came\r\nback to Morglay from the Old Federation and reported what had\r\nbeen happening out there since the Big War. Before that, we were\r\ndiscovering new planets and colonizing them. Since then, we've\r\nbeen picking the bones of the dead Terran Federation.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomething was going on by the escalators to the landing stage.\r\nPeople were moving excitedly in that direction, and the news cars\r\nwere circling like vultures over a sick cow. Harkaman wondered,\r\nhopefully, if it mightn't be a fight.\r\n\r\n\"Some drunk being bounced.\" Nikkolay, Lucas' cousin, commented.\r\n\"Sesar's let all Wardshaven in here, today. But, Lucas, this Tanith\r\nadventure; we're not making any hit-and-run raid. We're taking over\r\na whole planet; it'll be another Sword-World in forty or fifty\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Inside another century, we'll conquer the whole Federation,\" Baron\r\nRathmore declared. He was a politician and never let exaggeration\r\nworry him.\r\n\r\n\"What I don't understand,\" Harkaman said, \"is why you support Duke\r\nAngus, Lord Trask, if you think the Tanith adventure is doing Gram\r\nso much harm.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"If Angus didn't do it, somebody else would. But Angus is going to\r\nmake himself King of Gram, and I don't think anybody else could do\r\nthat. This planet needs a single sovereignty. I don't know how much\r\nyou've seen of it outside this duchy, but don't take Wardshaven as\r\ntypical. Some of these duchies, like Glaspyth or Didreksburg, are\r\nliteral snake pits. All the major barons are at each other's\r\nthroats, and they can't even keep their own knights and petty-barons\r\nin order. Why, there's a miserable little war down in Southmain\r\nContinent that's been going on for over two centuries.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's probably where Dunnan's going to take that army of his,\"\r\na robot-manufacturing baron said. \"I hope it gets wiped out, and\r\nDunnan with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't have to go to Southmain; just go to Glaspyth,\" somebody\r\nelse said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we don't get a planetary monarchy to keep order, this\r\nplanet will decivilize like anything in the Old Federation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _come_, Lucas!\" Alex Gorram protested. \"That's pulling it out\r\ntoo far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for one thing, we don't have the Neobarbarians,\" somebody\r\nsaid. \"And if they ever came out here, we'd blow them to\r\nEm-See-Square in nothing flat. Might be a good thing if they\r\ndid, too; it would stop us squabbling among ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman looked at him in surprise. \"Just who do you think the\r\nNeobarbarians are, anyhow?\" he asked. \"Some race of invading nomads;\r\nAttila's Huns in spaceships?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, isn't that who they are?\" Gorram asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nifflheim, no! There aren't a dozen and a half planets in the Old\r\nFederation that still have hyperdrive, and they're all civilized.\r\nThat's if 'civilized' is what Gilgamesh is,\" he added. \"These are\r\nhomemade barbarians. Workers and peasants who revolted to seize and\r\ndivide the wealth and then found they'd smashed the means of\r\nproduction and killed off all the technical brains. Survivors on\r\nplanets hit during the Interstellar Wars, from the Eleventh to\r\nthe Thirteenth Centuries, who lost the machinery of civilization.\r\nFollowers of political leaders on local-dictatorship planets.\r\nCompanies of mercenaries thrown out of employment and living by\r\npillage. Religious fanatics following self-anointed prophets.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think we don't have plenty of Neobarbarian material here on\r\nGram?\" Trask demanded. \"If you do, take a look around.\"\r\n\r\nGlaspyth, somebody said.\r\n\r\n\"That collection of over-ripe gallows-fruit Andray Dunnan's\r\nrecruited,\" Rathmore mentioned.\r\n\r\nAlex Gorram was grumbling that his shipyard was full of them;\r\nagitators stirring up trouble, trying to organize a strike to\r\nget rid of the robots.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Harkaman pounced on that last. \"I know of at least forty\r\ninstances, on a dozen and a half planets, in the last eight\r\ncenturies, of anti-technological movements. They had them on Terra,\r\nback as far as the Second Century Pre-Atomic. And after Venus\r\nseceded from the First Federation, before the Second Federation\r\nwas organized.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're interested in history?\" Rathmore asked.\r\n\r\n\"A hobby. All spacemen have hobbies. There's very little work\r\naboard ship in hyperspace; boredom is the worst enemy. My\r\nguns-and-missiles officer, Vann Larch, is a painter. Most of his\r\nwork was lost with the _Corisande_ on Durendal, but he kept us from\r\nstarving a few times on Flamberge by painting pictures and selling\r\nthem. My hyperspatial astrogator, Guatt Kirbey, composes music; he\r\ntries to express the mathematics of hyperspatial theory in musical\r\nterms. I don't care much for it, myself,\" he admitted. \"I study\r\nhistory. You know, it's odd; practically everything that's happened\r\non any of the inhabited planets happened on Terra before the first\r\nspaceship.\"\r\n\r\nThe garden immediately around them was quiet, now; everybody was\r\nover by the landing-stage escalators. Harkaman would have said more,\r\nbut at that moment he saw half a dozen of Sesar Karvall's uniformed\r\nguardsmen run past. They were helmeted and in bullet-proofs; one of\r\nthem had an auto-rifle, and the rest carried knobbed plastic\r\ntruncheons. The Space Viking set down his drink.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" he said. \"Our host is calling up his troops; I think\r\nthe guests ought to find battle-stations, too.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gaily-dressed crowd formed a semicircle facing the landing-stage\r\nescalators; everybody was staring in embarrassed curiosity, those\r\nbehind craning over the shoulders of those in front. The ladies had\r\ndrawn up their shawls in frigid formality; many had even covered\r\ntheir heads. There were four news-service cars hovering above;\r\nwhatever was going on was getting a planetwide screen showing. The\r\nKarvall guardsmen were trying to get through; their sergeant was\r\nsaying, over and over, \"Please, ladies and gentlemen; your pardon,\r\nnoble sir,\" and getting nowhere.\r\n\r\nOtto Harkaman swore disgustedly and shoved the sergeant aside.\r\n\"Make way, here!\" he bellowed. \"Let these guards pass.\" With that,\r\nhe almost hurled a gaily-dressed gentleman aside on either hand;\r\nthey both turned to glare angrily, then got hastily out of his way.\r\nMeditating briefly on the uses of bad manners in an emergency, Trask\r\nfollowed, with the others; the big Space Viking plowed to the front,\r\nwhere Sesar Karvall and Rovard Grauffis and several others were standing.\r\n\r\nFacing them, four men in black cloaks stood with their backs to\r\nthe escalators. Two were commonfolk retainers; hired gunmen, to be\r\nprecise. They were at pains to keep their hands plainly in sight,\r\nand seemed to be wishing themselves elsewhere. The man in front wore\r\na diamond sunburst jewel on his beret, and his cloak was lined with\r\npale blue silk. His thin, pointed face was deeply lined about the\r\nmouth and penciled with a thin black mustache. His eyes showed\r\nwhite all around the irises, and now and then his mouth would twitch\r\nin an involuntary grimace. Andray Dunnan; Trask wondered briefly how\r\nsoon he would have to look at him from twenty-five meters over the\r\nsights of a pistol. The face of the slightly taller man who stood at\r\nhis shoulder was paper-white, expressionless, with a black beard.\r\nHis name was Nevil Ormm, nobody was quite sure whence he had come,\r\nand he was Dunnan's henchman and constant companion.\r\n\r\n\"You lie!\" Dunnan was shouting. \"You lie damnably, in your stinking\r\nteeth, all of you! You've intercepted every message she's tried to\r\nsend me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter has sent you no messages, Lord Dunnan,\" Sesar Karvall\r\nsaid, with forced patience. \"None but the one I just gave you, that\r\nshe wants nothing whatever to do with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I believe that? You're holding her a prisoner; Satan\r\nonly knows how you've been torturing her to force her into this\r\nabominable marriage--\"\r\n\r\nThere was a stir among the bystanders; that was more than\r\nwell-mannered restraint could stand. Out of the murmur of\r\nincredulous voices, one woman's was quite audible:\r\n\r\n\"Well, really! He actually _is_ crazy!\"\r\n\r\nDunnan, like everybody else, heard it. \"Crazy, am I?\" he blazed.\r\n\"Because I can see through this hypocritical sham? Here's Lucas\r\nTrask, he wants an interest in Karvall mills, and here's Sesar\r\nKarvall, he wants access to iron deposits on Traskon land. And\r\nmy loving uncle, he wants the help of both of them in stealing\r\nOmfray of Glaspyth's duchy. And here's this loan-shark of a Ffayle,\r\ntrying to claw my lands away from me, and Rovard Grauffis, the fetchdog\r\nof my uncle who won't lift a finger to save his kinsman from ruin,\r\nand this foreigner Harkaman who's swindled me out of command of\r\nthe _Enterprise_. You're all plotting against me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Nevil,\" Grauffis said, \"you can see that Lord Dunnan's not\r\nhimself. If you're a good friend to him, you'll get him out of here\r\nbefore Duke Angus arrives.\"\r\n\r\nOrmm leaned forward and spoke urgently in Dunnan's ear. Dunnan\r\npushed him angrily away.\r\n\r\n\"Great Satan, are you against me, too?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nOrmm caught his arm. \"You fool, do you want to ruin everything,\r\nnow--\" He lowered his voice; the rest was inaudible.\r\n\r\n\"No, curse you, I won't go till I've spoken to her, face to face--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was another stir among the spectators; the crowd was parting,\r\nand Elaine was coming through, followed by her mother and Lady\r\nSandrasan and five or six other matrons. They all had their shawls\r\nover their heads, right ends over left shoulders; they all stopped\r\nexcept Elaine, who took a few steps forward and confronted Andray\r\nDunnan. He had never seen her look more beautiful, but it was the\r\nicy beauty of a honed dagger.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Dunnan, what do you wish to say to me?\" she asked. \"Say it\r\nquickly and then go; you are not welcome here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elaine!\" Dunnan cried, taking a step forward. \"Why do you cover\r\nyour head; why do you speak to me as a stranger? I am Andray,\r\nwho loves you. Why are you letting them force you into this\r\nwicked marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one is forcing me; I am marrying Lord Trask willingly and\r\nhappily, because I love him. Now, please, go and make no more\r\ntrouble at my wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie! They're making you say that! You don't have to marry\r\nhim; they can't make you. Come with me now. They won't dare stop\r\nyou. I'll take you away from all these cruel, greedy people. You\r\nlove me, you've always loved me. You've told me you loved me,\r\nagain and again--\"\r\n\r\nYes, in his own private dream-world, a world of fantasy that had now\r\nbecome Andray Dunnan's reality, in which an Elaine Karvall whom his\r\nimagination had created existed only to love him. Confronted by the\r\nreal Elaine, he simply rejected the reality.\r\n\r\n\"I never loved you, Lord Dunnan, and I never told you so. I never\r\nhated you, either, but you are making it very hard for me not to.\r\nNow go, and never let me see you again.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, she turned and started back through the crowd, which\r\nparted in front of her. Her mother and her aunt and the other ladies\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\"You lied to me!\" Dunnan shrieked after her. \"You lied all the time.\r\nYou're as bad as the rest of them, all scheming and plotting against\r\nme, betraying me. I know what it's about; you all want to cheat me\r\nof my rights, and keep my usurping uncle on the ducal throne. And\r\nyou, you false-hearted harlot, you're the worst of them all!\"\r\n\r\nSir Nevil Ormm caught his shoulder and spun him around, propelling\r\nhim toward the escalators. Dunnan struggled, screaming inarticulately\r\nlike a wounded wolf. Ormm was cursing furiously.\r\n\r\n\"You two!\" he shouted. \"Help me, here. Get hold of him.\"\r\n\r\nDunnan was still howling as they forced him onto the escalator, the\r\nbacks of the two retainers' cloaks, badged with the Dunnan crescent,\r\nlight blue on black, hiding him. After a little, an aircar with the\r\nblue crescent blazonry lifted and sped away.\r\n\r\n\"Lucas, he's crazy,\" Sesar Karvall was insisting. \"Elaine hasn't\r\nspoken fifty words to him since he came back from his last voyage--\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed and put a hand on Karvall's shoulder. \"I know that,\r\nSesar. You don't think, do you, that I need assurance of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Crazy, I'll say he's crazy,\" Rovard Grauffis put in. \"Did you\r\nhear what he said about his rights? Wait till his Grace hears\r\nabout that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he lay claim to the ducal throne, Sir Rovard?\" Otto Harkaman\r\nasked, sharply and seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he claims that his mother was born a year and a half before\r\nDuke Angus and the true date of her birth falsified to give Angus\r\nthe succession. Why, his present Grace was three years old when she\r\nwas born. I was old Duke Fergus' esquire; I carried Angus on my\r\nshoulder when Andray Dunnan's mother was presented to the lords\r\nand barons the day after she was born.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he's crazy,\" Alex Gorram agreed. \"I don't know why\r\nthe Duke doesn't have him put under psychiatric treatment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd put him under treatment,\" Harkaman said, drawing a finger\r\nacross under his beard. \"Crazy men who pretend to thrones are bombs\r\nthat ought to be deactivated, before they blow things up.\"\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't do that,\" Grauffis said. \"After all, he's Duke Angus'\r\nnephew--\"\r\n\r\n\"I could do it,\" Harkaman said. \"He only has three hundred men in\r\nthis company of his. Why you people ever let him recruit them Satan\r\nonly knows,\" he parenthesized. \"I have eight hundred; five hundred\r\nground-fighters. I'd like to see how they shape up in combat, before\r\nwe space out. I can have them ready for action in two hours, and\r\nit'd be all over before midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Captain Harkaman; his Grace would never permit it,\" Grauffis\r\nvetoed. \"You have no idea of the political harm that would do among\r\nthe independent lords on whom we're counting for support. You\r\nweren't here on Gram when Duke Ridgerd of Didreksburg had his sister\r\nSancia's second husband poisoned--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThey halted under the colonnade; beyond, the lower main terrace was\r\ncrowded, and a medley of old love songs was wafting from the sound\r\noutlets, for the sixth or eighth time around. He looked at his\r\nwatch; it was ninety seconds later than the last time he had done\r\nso. Give it fifteen more minutes to get started, and another fifteen\r\nto get away after the marriage toasts and the felicitations. And\r\nno marriage, however pompous, lasted more than half an hour. An\r\nhour, then, till he and Elaine would be in the aircar, bulleting\r\ntoward Traskon.\r\n\r\nThe love songs stopped abruptly; after a momentary silence, a\r\ntrumpet, considerably amplified, blared; the \"Ducal Salute.\" The\r\ncrowd stopped shifting, the buzz of voices ceased. At the head of\r\nthe landing-stage escalators there was a glow of color and the ducal\r\nparty began moving down. A platoon of guards in red and yellow, with\r\ngilded helmets and tasseled halberds. An esquire bearing the Sword\r\nof State. Duke Angus, with his council, Otto Harkaman among them;\r\nthe Duchess Flavia and her companion-ladies. The household gentlemen,\r\nand their ladies. More guardsmen. There was a great burst of cheering;\r\nthe news-service aircars got into position above the procession.\r\nCousin Nikkolay and a few others stepped out from between the pillars\r\ninto the sunlight; there was a similar movement at the other side of\r\nthe terrace. The ducal party reached the end of the central walkway,\r\nhalted and deployed.\r\n\r\n\"All right; let's shove off,\" Cousin Nikkolay said, stepping forward.\r\n\r\nTen minutes since they had come outside; another five to get into\r\nposition. Fifty minutes, now, till he and Elaine--Lady Elaine Trask\r\nof Traskon, for real and for always--would be going home.\r\n\r\n\"Sure the car's ready?\" he asked, for the hundredth time.\r\n\r\nHis cousin assured him that it was. Figures in Karvall black and\r\nflame-yellow appeared across the terrace. The music began again,\r\nthis time the stately \"Nobles' Wedding March,\" arrogant and at\r\nthe same time tender. Sesar Karvall's gentleman-secretary, and\r\nthe Karvall lawyer; executives of the steel mills, the Karvall\r\nguard-captain. Sesar himself, with Elaine on his arm; she was\r\nwearing a shawl of black and yellow. He looked around in sudden\r\nfright; \"For the love of Satan, where's our shawl?\" he demanded, and\r\nthen relaxed when one of his gentlemen exhibited it, green and tawny\r\nin Traskon colors. The bridesmaids, led by Lady Lavina Karvall.\r\nFinally they halted, ten yards apart, in front of the Duke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Who approaches us?\" Duke Angus asked of his guard-captain.\r\n\r\nHe had a thin, pointed face, almost femininely sensitive, and a\r\nsmall pointed beard. He was bareheaded except for the narrow golden\r\ncirclet which he spent most of his waking time scheming to convert\r\ninto a royal crown. The guard-captain repeated the question.\r\n\r\n\"I am Sir Nikkolay Trask; I bring my cousin and liege-lord,\r\nLucas, Lord Trask, Baron of Traskon. He comes to receive the\r\nLady-Demoiselle Elaine, daughter of Lord Sesar Karvall, Baron\r\nof Karvall mills, and the sanction of your Grace to the marriage\r\nbetween them.\"\r\n\r\nSir Maxamon Zhorgay, Sesar Karvall's henchman, named himself and\r\nhis lord; they brought the Lady-Demoiselle Elaine to be wed to\r\nLord Trask of Traskon. The Duke, satisfied that these were persons\r\nwhom he could address directly, asked if the terms of the\r\nmarriage-agreement had been reached; both parties affirmed this.\r\nSir Maxamon passed a scroll to the Duke; Duke Angus began to read\r\nthe stiff and precise legal phraseology.\r\n\r\nMarriages between noble houses were not matters to be left open\r\nto dispute; a great deal of spilled blood and burned powder had\r\nresulted from ambiguity on some point of succession or inheritance\r\nor dower rights. Lucas bore it patiently; he didn't want his\r\ngreat-grandchildren and Elaine's shooting it out over a matter\r\nof a misplaced comma.\r\n\r\n\"And these persons here before us do enter into this marriage\r\nfreely?\" the Duke asked, when the reading had ended. He stepped\r\nforward as he spoke, and his esquire gave him the two-hand Sword of\r\nState, heavy enough to behead a bisonoid. Trask stepped forward;\r\nSesar Karvall brought Elaine up. The lawyers and henchmen obliqued\r\noff to the sides. \"How say you, Lord Trask?\" he asked, almost\r\nconversationally.\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart, your Grace.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Lady-Demoiselle Elaine?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my dearest wish, your Grace.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke took the sword by the blade and extended it; they laid\r\ntheir hands on the jeweled pommel.\r\n\r\n\"And do you, and your houses, avow us, Angus, Duke of Wardshaven,\r\nto be your sovereign prince, and pledge fealty to us and to our\r\nlegitimate and lawful successors?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do.\" Not only he and Elaine, but all around them, and all the\r\nthrong in the gardens, answered, the spectators in shouts. Very\r\nclearly, above it all, somebody, with more enthusiasm than\r\ndiscretion, was bawling: \"_Long live Angus the First of Gram!_\"\r\n\r\n\"And we, Angus, do confer upon you two, and your houses, the right\r\nto wear our badge as you see fit, and pledge ourself to maintain\r\nyour rights against any and all who may presume to invade them. And\r\nwe declare that this marriage between you two, and this agreement\r\nbetween your respective houses, does please us, and we avow you two,\r\nLucas and Elaine, to be lawfully wed, and who so questions this\r\nmarriage challenges us, in our teeth and to our despite.\"\r\n\r\nThat wasn't exactly the wording used by a ducal lord on Gram. It was\r\nthe formula employed by a planetary king, like Napolyon of Flamberge\r\nor Rodolf of Excalibur. And, now that he thought of it, Angus had\r\nconsistently used the royal first-person plural. Maybe that fellow\r\nwho had shouted about Angus the First of Gram had only been doing\r\nwhat he'd been paid to do. This was being telecast, and Omfray of\r\nGlaspyth and Ridgerd of Didreksburg would both be listening; as of\r\nnow, they'd start hiring mercenaries. Maybe that would get rid of\r\nDunnan for him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke gave the two-hand sword back to his esquire. The young\r\nknight who was carrying the green and tawny shawl handed it to him,\r\nand Elaine dropped the black and yellow one from her shoulders,\r\nthe only time a respectable woman ever did that in public, and her\r\nmother caught and folded it. He stepped forward and draped the Trask\r\ncolors over her shoulders, and then took her in his arms. The\r\ncheering broke out again, and some of Sesar Karvall's guardsmen\r\nbegan firing a pom-pom somewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt took a little longer than he had expected to finish with the\r\ntoasts and shake hands with those who crowded around. Finally, the\r\nexit march started, down the long walkway to the landing stage,\r\nand the Duke and his party moved away to the rear to prepare for\r\nthe wedding feast at which everybody but the bride and groom would\r\ncelebrate. One of the bridesmaids gave Elaine a huge sheaf of\r\nflowers, which she was to toss back from the escalator; she held it\r\nin the crook of one arm and clung to his with the other.\r\n\r\n\"Darling; we really made it!\" she was whispering, as though it were\r\ntoo wonderful to believe.\r\n\r\nWell, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nOne of the news cars--orange and blue, that was Westlands Telecast\r\n& Teleprint--had floated just ahead of them and was letting down\r\ntoward the landing stage. For a moment, he was angry; that went\r\nbeyond the outer-orbit limits of journalistic propriety, even for\r\nWestlands T & T. Then he laughed; today he was too happy for anger\r\nabout anything. At the foot of the escalator, Elaine kicked off her\r\ngilded slippers--there was another pair in the car; he'd seen to\r\nthat personally--and they stepped onto the escalator and turned\r\nabout. The bridesmaids rushed forward, and began struggling for the\r\nslippers, to the damage and disarray of their gowns, and when they\r\nwere half way up, Elaine heaved the bouquet and it burst apart among\r\nthem like a bomb of colored fragrance, and the girls below snatched\r\nat the flowers, shrieking deliriously. Elaine stood, blowing kisses\r\nto everybody, and he was shaking his clasped hands over his head,\r\nuntil they were at the top.\r\n\r\nWhen they turned and stepped off, the orange and blue aircar had\r\nlet down directly in front of them, blocking their way. Now he was\r\nreally furious, and started forward with a curse. Then he saw who\r\nwas in the car.\r\n\r\nAndray Dunnan, his thin face contorted and the narrow mustache\r\nwrithing on his upper lip; he had a slit beside the window open\r\nand was tilting the barrel of a submachine gun up and out of it.\r\n\r\nHe shouted, and at the same time tripped Elaine and flung her down.\r\nHe was throwing himself forward to cover her when there was a\r\nblasting multiple report. Something sledged him in the chest;\r\nhis right leg crumpled under him. He fell--\r\n\r\nHe fell and fell and fell, endlessly, through darkness, out of\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was crucified, and crowned with a crown of thorns. Who had they\r\ndone that to? Somebody long ago, on Terra. His arms were drawn out\r\nstiffly, and hurt; his feet and legs hurt, too, and he couldn't move\r\nthem, and there was this prickling at his brow. And he was blind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNo; his eyes were just closed. He opened them, and there was a white\r\nwall in front of him, patterned with a blue snow-crystal design, and\r\nhe realized that it was a ceiling and that he was lying on his back.\r\nHe couldn't move his head, but by shifting his eyes he saw that he\r\nwas completely naked and surrounded by a tangle of tubes and wires,\r\nwhich puzzled him briefly. Then he knew that he was not on a bed,\r\nbut on a robomedic, and the tubes would be for medication and\r\nwound drainage and intravenous feeding, and the wires would be\r\nto electrodes imbedded in his body for diagnosis, and the\r\ncrown-of-thorns thing would be more electrodes for an encephalograph.\r\nHe'd been on one of those robomedics before, when he had been gored\r\nby a bisonoid on the cattle range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThat was what it was; he was still under treatment. But that seemed\r\nso long ago; so many things--he must have dreamed them--seemed to\r\nhave happened.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered, and struggled futilely to rise.\r\n\r\n\"Elaine!\" he called. \"Elaine, where are you?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a stir and somebody came into his limited view; his\r\ncousin, Nikkolay Trask.\r\n\r\n\"Nikkolay; Andray Dunnan,\" he said. \"What happened to Elaine?\"\r\n\r\nNikkolay winced, as though something he had expected to hurt had\r\nhurt worse than he had expected.\r\n\r\n\"Lucas.\" He swallowed. \"Elaine ... Elaine is dead.\"\r\n\r\nElaine is dead. That didn't make sense.\r\n\r\n\"She was killed instantly, Lucas. Hit six times; I don't think\r\nshe even felt the first one. She didn't suffer at all.\"\r\n\r\nSomebody moaned, and then he realized that it had been himself.\r\n\r\n\"You were hit twice,\" Nikkolay was telling him. \"One in the leg;\r\nsmashed the femur. And one in the chest. That one missed your heart\r\nby an inch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity it did.\" He was beginning to remember clearly, now. \"I threw\r\nher down, and tried to cover her. I must have thrown her straight\r\ninto the burst and only caught the last of it myself.\" There was\r\nsomething else; oh, yes. \"Dunnan. Did they get him?\"\r\n\r\nNikkolay shook his head. \"He got away. Stole the _Enterprise_ and\r\ntook her off-planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to get him myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe started to rise again; Nikkolay nodded to someone out of sight.\r\nA cool hand touched his chin, and he smelled a woman's perfume,\r\nnothing at all like Elaine's. Something like a small insect bit\r\nhim on the neck. The room grew dark.\r\n\r\nElaine was dead. There was no more Elaine, nowhere at all. Why,\r\nthat must mean there was no more world. So that was why it had\r\ngotten so dark.\r\n\r\nHe woke again, fitfully, and it would be daylight and he could see\r\nthe yellow sky through an open window or it would be night and the\r\nwall-lights would be on. There would always be somebody with him.\r\nNikkolay's wife, Dame Cecelia; Rovard Grauffis; Lady Lavina\r\nKarvall--he must have slept a long time, for she was so much older\r\nthan he remembered--and her brother, Burt Sandrasan. And a woman\r\nwith dark hair, in a white smock with a gold caduceus on her breast.\r\n\r\nOnce, Duchess Flavia, and once Duke Angus himself. He asked where\r\nhe was, not much caring. They told him, at the Ducal Palace.\r\n\r\nHe wished they'd all go away, and let him go wherever Elaine was.\r\n\r\nThen it would be dark, and he would be trying to find her, because\r\nthere was something he wanted desperately to show her. Stars in the\r\nsky at night, that was it. But there were no stars, there was no\r\nElaine, there was no anything, and he wished that there was no\r\nLucas Trask, either.\r\n\r\nBut there was an Andray Dunnan. He could see him standing\r\nblack-cloaked on the terrace, the diamonds in his beret-jewel\r\nglittering evilly; he could see the mad face peering at him over\r\nthe rising barrel of the submachine gun. And then he would hunt\r\nfor him without finding him, through the cold darkness of space.\r\n\r\nThe waking periods grew longer, and during them his mind was clear.\r\nThey relieved him of his crown of electronic thorns. The feeding\r\ntubes came out, and they gave him cups of broth and fruit juice.\r\nHe wanted to know why he had been brought to the Palace.\r\n\r\n\"About the only thing we could do,\" Rovard Grauffis told him.\r\n\"They had too much trouble at Karvall House as it was. You know,\r\nSesar got shot, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" So that was why Sesar hadn't come to see him. \"Was he killed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wounded; he's in worse shape than you are. When the shooting\r\nstarted, he went charging up the escalator. Didn't have anything\r\nbut his dress-dagger. Dunnan gave him a quick burst; I think that\r\nwas why he didn't have time to finish you off. By that time, the\r\nguards who'd been shooting blanks from that rapid-fire gun got in\r\na clip of live rounds and fired at him. He got out of there as fast\r\nas he could. They have Sesar on a robomedic like yours. He isn't\r\nin any danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe drainage tubes and medication tubes came out; the tangle of\r\nwires around him was removed, and the electrodes with them. They\r\nbandaged his wounds and dressed him in a loose robe and lifted him\r\nfrom the robomedic to a couch, where he could sit up when he wished;\r\nthey began giving him solid food, and wine to drink, and allowed him\r\nto smoke. The woman doctor told him he'd had a bad time, as though\r\nhe didn't know that. He wondered if she expected him to thank her\r\nfor keeping him alive.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be up and around in a few weeks,\" his cousin added. \"I've\r\nseen to it that everything at Traskon New House will be ready for\r\nyou by then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll never enter that house as long as I live, and I wish that\r\nwouldn't be more than the next minute. That was to be Elaine's\r\nhouse. I won't go to it alone.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dreams troubled his sleep less and less as he grew stronger.\r\nVisitors came often, bringing amusing little gifts, and he found\r\nthat he enjoyed their company. He wanted to know what had really\r\nhappened, and how Dunnan had gotten away.\r\n\r\n\"He pirated the _Enterprise_,\" Rovard Grauffis told him. \"He had\r\nthat company of mercenaries of his, and he'd bribed some of the\r\npeople at the Gorram shipyards. I thought Alex would kill his chief\r\nof security when he found out what had happened. We can't prove\r\nanything--we're trying hard enough to--but we're sure Omfray of\r\nGlaspyth furnished the money. He's been denying it just a shade\r\ntoo emphatically.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the whole thing was planned in advance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taking the ship was; he must have been planning that for months;\r\nbefore he started recruiting that company. I think he meant to do\r\nit the night before the wedding. Then he tried to persuade the\r\nLady-Demoiselle Elaine to elope with him--he seems to have actually\r\nthought that was possible--and when she humiliated him, he decided\r\nto kill both of you first.\" He turned to Otto Harkaman, who had\r\naccompanied him. \"As long as I live, I'll regret not taking you\r\nat your word and accepting your offer, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did he get hold of that Westlands Telecast and Teleprint car?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. The morning of the wedding, he screened Westlands editorial\r\noffice and told them he had the inside story on the marriage and\r\nwhy the Duke was sponsoring it. Made it sound as though there was\r\nsome scandal; insisted that a reporter come to Dunnan House for a\r\nface-to-face interview. They sent a man, and that was the last they\r\nsaw him alive; our people found his body at Dunnan House when we\r\nwere searching the place afterward. We found the car at the\r\nshipyard; it had taken a couple of hits from the guns at Karvall\r\nHouse, but you know what these press cars are built to stand. He\r\nwent directly to the shipyard, where his men already had the\r\n_Enterprise_; as soon as he arrived, she lifted out.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at the cigarette between his fingers. It was almost\r\nshort enough to burn him. With an effort, he leaned forward to\r\ncrush it out.\r\n\r\n\"Rovard, how soon will that second ship be finished?\"\r\n\r\nGrauffis laughed bitterly. \"Building the _Enterprise_ took\r\neverything we had. The duchy's on the edge of bankruptcy now. We\r\nstopped work on the second ship six months ago because we didn't\r\nhave enough money to keep on with her and still get the _Enterprise_\r\nfinished. We were expecting the _Enterprise_ to make enough in the\r\nOld Federation to finish the second one. Then, with two ships and\r\na base on Tanith, the money would begin coming in instead of going\r\nout. But now--\"\r\n\r\n\"It leaves me where I was on Flamberge,\" Harkaman added. \"Worse.\r\nKing Napolyon was going to help the Elmersans, and I'd have gotten\r\na command in that. It's too late for that now.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up his cane and used it to push himself to his feet.\r\nThe broken leg had mended, but he was still weak. He took a few\r\ntottering steps, paused to lean on the cane, and then forced\r\nhimself on to the open window and stood for a moment staring out.\r\nThen he turned.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Harkaman, it might be that you could still get a command,\r\nhere on Gram. That's if you don't mind commanding under me as\r\nowner-aboard. I am going hunting for Andray Dunnan.\"\r\n\r\nThey both looked at him. After a moment, Harkaman said:\r\n\r\n\"I'd count it an honor, Lord Trask. But where will you get a ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's half finished now. You already have a crew for her. Duke\r\nAngus can finish her for me, and pay for it by pledging his new\r\nbarony of Traskon.\"\r\n\r\nHe had known Rovard Grauffis all his life; until this moment,\r\nhe had never seen Duke Angus' henchman show surprise.\r\n\r\n\"You mean, you'll trade Traskon for that ship?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Finished, equipped and ready for space, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duke will agree to that,\" Grauffis said promptly. \"But, Lucas;\r\nTraskon is all you own.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I have a ship, I won't need them. I am turning Space Viking.\"\r\n\r\nThat brought Harkaman to his feet with a roar of approval. Grauffis\r\nlooked at him, his mouth slightly open.\r\n\r\n\"Lucas Trask--Space Viking,\" he said. \"Now I've heard everything.\"\r\n\r\nWell, why not? He had deplored the effects of Viking raiding on\r\nthe Sword-Worlds, because Gram was a Sword-World, and Traskon was\r\non Gram, and Traskon was to have been the home where he and Elaine\r\nwould live and where their children and children's children would\r\nbe born and live. Now the little point on which all of it had\r\nrested was gone.\r\n\r\n\"That was another Lucas Trask, Rovard. He's dead, now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nGrauffis excused himself to make a screen call and then returned to\r\nexcuse himself again. Evidently Duke Angus had dropped whatever he\r\nwas doing as soon as he heard what his henchman had to tell him.\r\nHarkaman was silent until after he was out of the room, then said:\r\n\r\n\"Lord Trask, this is a wonderful thing for me. It's not been\r\npleasant to be a shipless captain living on strangers' bounty.\r\nI'd hate, though, to have you think, some time, that I'd advanced\r\nmy own fortunes at the expense of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about that. If anybody's being taken advantage of,\r\nyou are. I need a space-captain, and your misfortune is my own\r\ngood luck.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman started to pack tobacco into his pipe. \"Have you ever been\r\noff Gram, at all?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"A few years at the University of Camelot, on Excalibur. Otherwise, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you any conception of the sort of thing you're setting\r\nyourself to?\" The Space Viking snapped his lighter and puffed.\r\n\"You know, of course, how big the Old Federation is. You know the\r\nfigures, that is, but do they mean anything to you? I know they\r\ndon't to a good many spacemen, even. We talk glibly about ten to the\r\nhundredth power, but emotionally we still count, 'One, Two, Three,\r\nMany.' A ship in hyperspace logs about a light-year an hour. You\r\ncan go from here to Excalibur in thirty hours. But you could send\r\na radio message announcing the birth of a son, and he'd be a father\r\nbefore it was received. The Old Federation, where you're going to\r\nhunt Dunnan, occupies a space-volume of two hundred billion cubic\r\nlight-years. And you're hunting for one ship and one man in that.\r\nHow are you going to do it, Lord Trask?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't started thinking about how; all I know is that I have to\r\ndo it. There are planets in the Old Federation where Space Vikings\r\ncome and go; raid-and-trade bases, like the one Duke Angus planned\r\nto establish on Tanith. At one or another of them, I'll pick up word\r\nof Dunnan, sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll hear where he was a year ago, and by the time we get there,\r\nhe'll be gone for a year and a half to two years. We've been raiding\r\nthe Old Federation for over three hundred years, Lord Trask. At present,\r\nI'd say there are at least two hundred Space Viking ships in operation.\r\nWhy haven't we raided it bare long ago? Well, that's the answer:\r\ndistance and voyage-time. You know, Dunnan could die of old age--which\r\nis not a usual cause of death among Space Vikings--before you caught up\r\nwith him. And your youngest ship's-boy could die of old age before he\r\nfound out about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can go on hunting for him till I die, then. There's nothing\r\nelse that means anything to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was something like that. I won't be with you, all your\r\nlife. I want a ship of my own, like the _Corisande_, that I lost on\r\nDurendal. Some day, I'll have one. But till you can command your own\r\nship, I'll command her for you. That's a promise.\"\r\n\r\nSome note of ceremony seemed indicated. Summoning a robot, he had it\r\npour wine for them, and they pledged each other.\r\n\r\nRovard Grauffis had recovered his aplomb by the time he returned\r\naccompanied by the Duke. If Angus had ever lost his, he gave no\r\nindication of it. The effect on everybody else was literally seismic.\r\nThe generally accepted view was that Lord Trask's reason had been\r\nunhinged by his tragic loss; there might, he conceded, be more than\r\na crumb of truth in that. At first, his cousin Nikkolay raged at him\r\nfor alienating the barony from the family, and then he learned that\r\nDuke Angus was appointing him vicar-baron and giving him Traskon\r\nNew House for his residence. Immediately he began acting like one\r\nat the death-bed of a rich grandmother. The Wardshaven financial\r\nand industrial barons, whom he had known only distantly, on the\r\nother hand, came flocking around him, offering assistance and\r\nhailing him as the savior of the duchy. Duke Angus' credit, almost\r\nobliterated by the loss of the _Enterprise_, was firmly\r\nre-established, and theirs with it.\r\n\r\nThere were conferences at which lawyers and bankers argued\r\ninterminably; he attended a few at first, found himself completely\r\nuninterested, and told everybody so. All he wanted was a ship; the\r\nbest ship possible, as soon as possible. Alex Gorram had been the\r\nfirst to be notified; he had commenced work on the unfinished\r\nsister-ship of the _Enterprise_ immediately. Until he was strong\r\nenough to go to the shipyard himself, he watched the work on the\r\ntwo-thousand-foot globular skeleton by screen, and conferred either\r\nin person or by screen with engineers and shipyard executives. His\r\nrooms at the ducal palace were converted, almost overnight, from\r\nsickrooms to offices. The doctors, who had recently been urging\r\nhim to find new interests and activities, were now warning of the\r\ndangers of overexertion. Harkaman finally added his voice to theirs.\r\n\r\n\"You take it easy, Lucas.\" They had dropped formality and were\r\non a first-name basis now. \"You got hulled pretty badly; you let\r\ndamage-control work on you, and don't strain the machinery till\r\nit's fixed. We have plenty of time. We're not going to get anywhere\r\nchasing Dunnan. The only way we can catch him is by interception.\r\nThe longer he moves around in the Old Federation before he hears\r\nwe're after him, the more of a trail he'll leave. Once we can\r\nestablish a predictable pattern, we'll have a chance. Then, some\r\ntime, he'll come out of hyperspace somewhere and find us waiting\r\nfor him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think he went to Tanith?\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman heaved himself out of his chair and prowled about the room\r\nfor a few minutes, then came back and sat down again.\r\n\r\n\"No. That was Duke Angus' idea, not his. He couldn't put in a base\r\non Tanith, anyhow. You know the kind of a crew he has.\"\r\n\r\nThere had been an extensive inquiry into Dunnan's associates and\r\naccomplices; Duke Angus was still hoping for positive proof to\r\nimplicate Omfray of Glaspyth in the piracy. Dunnan had with him\r\na dozen and a half employees of the Gorram shipyards whom he had\r\ncorrupted. There was some technical ability among them, but for the\r\nmost part they were agitators and trouble-makers and incompetent\r\nworkmen. Even under the circumstances, Alex Gorram was glad to see\r\nthe last of them. As for Dunnan's own mercenary company, there were\r\nabout a score of former spacemen among them; the rest graded down\r\nfrom bandits through thugs and sneak-thieves to barroom bums.\r\nDunnan himself was an astrogator, not an engineer.\r\n\r\n\"That gang aren't even good enough for routine raiding,\" Harkaman\r\nsaid. \"They'd never under any circumstances be able to put in a base\r\non Tanith. Unless Dunnan's completely crazy, which I doubt, he's gone\r\nto some regular Viking base planet, like Hoth or Nergal or Dagon or\r\nXochitl, to recruit officers and engineers and able spacemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that machinery and robotic equipment and so on that was going\r\nto Tanith--was that aboard when he took the ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and that's another reason why he'd go to some planet like Hoth\r\nor Nergal or Xochitl. On a Viking-occupied planet in the Old\r\nFederation, that stuff's almost worth its weight in gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's Tanith like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost completely Terra-type, third of a Class-G sun. Very much\r\nlike Haulteclere or Flamberge. It was one of the last planets the\r\nFederation colonized before the Big War. Nobody knows what happened,\r\nexactly. There wasn't any interstellar war; at least, you don't find\r\nany big slag-puddles where cities used to be. They probably did\r\na lot of fighting among themselves, after they got out of the\r\nFederation. There's still some traces of combat-damage around. Then\r\nthey started to decivilize, down to the pre-mechanical level--wind\r\nand water power and animal power. They have draft-animals that look\r\nlike introduced Terran carabaos, and a few small sailboats and big\r\ncanoes and bateaux on the rivers. They have gunpowder, which seems\r\nto be the last thing any people lose.\r\n\r\n\"I was there, five years ago. I liked Tanith for a base. There's one\r\nmoon, almost solid nickel iron, and fissionable-ore deposits. Then,\r\nlike a fool, I hired out to the Elmersans on Durendal and lost my\r\nship. When I came here, your Duke was thinking about Xipototec. I\r\nconvinced him that Tanith was a better planet for his purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dunnan might go there, at that. He might think he was scoring one\r\non Duke Angus. After all, he has all that equipment.\"\r\n\r\n\"And nobody to use it. If I were Dunnan, I'd go to Nergal, or\r\nXochitl. There are always a couple of thousand Space Vikings on\r\neither, spending their loot and taking it easy between raids. He\r\ncould sign on a full crew on either. I suggest we go to Xochitl,\r\nfirst. We might pick up news of him, if nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll right, they'd try Xochitl first. Harkaman knew the planet,\r\nand was friendly with the Haulteclere noble who ruled it.\r\n\r\nThe work went on at the Gorram shipyard; it had taken a year\r\nto build the _Enterprise_, but the steel-mills and engine-works\r\nwere over the preparatory work of tooling up, and material and\r\nequipment was flowing in a steady stream. Lucas let them persuade\r\nhim to take more rest, and day by day grew stronger. Soon he was\r\nspending most of his time at the shipyard, watching the engines\r\ngo in--Abbot lift-and-drive for normal space, Dillingham hyperdrive,\r\npower-converters, pseudograv, all at the center of the globular ship.\r\n\r\nLiving quarters and workshops went in next, all armored in\r\ncollapsium-plated steel. Then the ship lifted out to an orbit a\r\nthousand miles off-planet, followed by swarms of armored work-craft\r\nand cargo-lighters; the rest of the work was more easily done in\r\nspace. At the same time, the four two-hundred-foot pinnaces that\r\nwould be carried aboard were being finished. Each of them had its\r\nown hyperdrive engines, and could travel as far and as fast as\r\nthe ship herself.\r\n\r\nOtto Harkaman was beginning to be distressed because the ship still\r\nlacked a name. He didn't like having to speak of her as \"her,\" or\r\n\"the ship,\" and there were many things soon to go on that should be\r\nname-marked. _Elaine_, Trask thought, at once, and almost at once\r\nrejected it. He didn't want her name associated with the things\r\nthat ship would do in the Old Federation. _Revenge_, _Avenger_,\r\n_Retribution_, _Vendetta_; none appealed to him. A news-commentator,\r\nturgidly eloquent about the nemesis which the criminal Dunnan had\r\ninvoked against himself, supplied it, _Nemesis_ it was.\r\n\r\nNow he was studying his new profession of interstellar robbery and\r\nmurder against which he had once inveighed. Otto Harkaman's handful\r\nof followers became his teachers. Vann Larch, guns-and-missiles,\r\nwho was also a painter; Guatt Kirbey, sour and pessimistic, the\r\nhyperspatial astrogator who tried to express his science in music;\r\nSharll Renner, the normal-space astrogator. Alvyn Karffard, the\r\nexec, who had been with Harkaman longest of all. And Sir Paytrik\r\nMorland, a local recruit, formerly guard-captain to Count Lionel\r\nof Newhaven, who commanded the ground-fighters and the combat\r\ncontragravity. They were using the farms and villages of Traskon\r\nfor drill and practice, and he noticed that while the _Nemesis_\r\nwould carry only five hundred ground and air fighters, over a\r\nthousand were being trained.\r\n\r\nHe commented to Rovard Grauffis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Don't mention it outside,\" the Duke's henchman said. \"You and\r\nSir Paytrik and Captain Harkaman will pick the five hundred best.\r\nThe Duke will take the rest into his service. Some of these days,\r\nOmfray of Glaspyth will find out what a Space Viking raid is really\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Duke Angus would tax his new subjects of Glaspyth to redeem\r\nthe pledges on his new barony of Traskon. Some old Pre-Atomic writer\r\nHarkaman was fond of quoting had said, \"Gold will not always get\r\nyou good soldiers, but good soldiers can get you gold.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Nemesis_ came back to the Gorram yards and settled onto her\r\ncurved landing legs like a monstrous spider. The _Enterprise_ had\r\nborne the Ward sword and atom-symbol; the _Nemesis_ should bear his\r\nown badge, but the bisonoid head, tawny on green, of Traskon, was no\r\nlonger his. He chose a skull impaled on an upright sword, and it was\r\nblazoned on the ship when he and Harkaman took her out for her\r\nshakedown cruise.\r\n\r\nWhen they landed again at the Gorram yards, two hundred hours later,\r\nthey learned that a tramp freighter from Morglay had come into\r\nBigglersport in their absence with news of Andray Dunnan. Her\r\ncaptain had come to Wardshaven at Duke Angus' urgent invitation\r\nand was waiting for them at the Ducal Palace.\r\n\r\nThey sat, a dozen of them, around a table in the Duke's private\r\napartments. The freighter captain, a small, precise man with a\r\ngraying beard, alternately puffed at a cigarette and sipped from\r\na beaker of brandy.\r\n\r\n\"I spaced out from Morglay two hundred hours ago,\" he was saying. \"I'd\r\nbeen there twelve local days, three hundred Galactic Standard hours,\r\nand the run from Curtana was three hundred and twenty. This ship,\r\nthe _Enterprise_, spaced out from there several days before I did.\r\nI'd say she's twelve hundred hours out of Windsor, on Curtana, now.\"\r\n\r\nThe room was still. The breeze fluttered curtains at the open\r\nwindows; from the garden below, winged night-things twittered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I never expected it,\" Harkaman said. \"I thought he'd take the ship\r\nout to the Old Federation at once.\" He poured wine for himself. \"Of\r\ncourse, Dunnan's crazy. A crazy man has an advantage, sometimes,\r\nlike a left-handed knife-fighter. He does unexpected things.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't such a crazy move,\" Rovard Grauffis said. \"We have very\r\nlittle direct trade with Curtana. It's only an accident we heard\r\nabout this when we did.\"\r\n\r\nThe freighter captain's beaker was half empty. He filled it to the\r\nbrim from the decanter.\r\n\r\n\"She was the first Gram ship there for years,\" he agreed. \"That\r\nattracted notice, of course. And his having the blazonry changed,\r\nfrom the sword and atom-symbol to the blue crescent. And the\r\nill-feeling on the part of other captains and planet-side employers\r\nabout the men he'd lured away from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many men and what kind?\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the gray beard shrugged. \"I was too busy getting a\r\ncargo together for Morglay, to pay much attention. Almost a full\r\nspaceship complement, officers and spacemen of every kind. And a\r\nlot of industrial engineers and technicians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he is going to use that equipment that was aboard, and put in\r\na base somewhere,\" somebody said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"If he left Curtana twelve hundred hours ago, he's still in\r\nhyperspace,\" Guatt Kirbey said. \"It's over two thousand from Curtana\r\nto the nearest Old Federation planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far to Tanith?\" Duke Angus asked. \"I'm sure that's where he's\r\ngone. He'd expect me to finish the other ship and equip her like the\r\n_Enterprise_ and send her out; he'd want to get there first.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd thought that Tanith would be the last place he'd go,\" Harkaman\r\nsaid, \"but this changes the whole outlook. He could have gone to Tanith.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's crazy, and you're trying to apply sane logic to him,\" Guatt\r\nKirbey said. \"You're figuring what you'd do, and you aren't crazy.\r\nOf course, I've had my doubts, at times, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's crazy, and Captain Harkaman's allowing for that,\" Rovard\r\nGrauffis said. \"Dunnan hates all of us. He hates his Grace, here.\r\nHe hates Lord Lucas, and Sesar Karvall; of course, he may think\r\nhe killed both of them. He hates Captain Harkaman. So how could\r\nhe score all of us off at once? By taking Tanith.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say he was buying supplies and ammunition?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. Gun ammunition, ship's missiles, and a lot of\r\nground-defense missiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was he buying them with? Trading machinery?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Lothar Ffayle found out that a lot of gold was transferred to\r\nDunnan from banks in Glaspyth and Didreksburg,\" Grauffis said. \"He\r\ngot that aboard when he took the ship, evidently.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Trask said. \"We can't be sure of anything, but we have\r\nsome reasons for thinking he went to Tanith, and that's more than\r\nwe have for any other planet in the Old Federation. I won't try to\r\nestimate the odds against our finding him there, but they're a good\r\ndeal bigger anywhere else. We'll go there, first.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outside viewscreen, which had been vacantly gray for over\r\nthree thousand hours, was now a vertiginous swirl of color, the\r\nindescribable color of a collapsing hyperspatial field. No two\r\nobservers ever saw it alike, and no imagination could vision the\r\nactuality. Trask found that he was holding his breath. So, he\r\nnoticed, was Otto Harkaman, beside him. It was something, evidently,\r\nthat nobody got used to. Even Guatt Kirbey, the astrogator, was\r\nsitting with his pipe clenched in his mouth, staring at the screen.\r\n\r\nThen, in an instant, the stars, which had literally not been there\r\nbefore, filled the screen with a blaze of splendor against the black\r\nvelvet backdrop of normal space. Dead in the center, brighter than\r\nall the rest, Ertado's Star, the sun of Tanith, burned yellowly.\r\nThe light from it was ten hours old.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty good, Guatt,\" Harkaman said, picking up his cup.\r\n\r\n\"Good, Gehenna; it was perfect,\" somebody else said.\r\n\r\nKirbey was relighting his pipe. \"Oh, I suppose it'll have to do,\" he\r\ngrudged, around the stem. He had gray hair and an untidy mustache,\r\nand nothing was ever quite good enough to satisfy him. \"I could have\r\nmade it a little closer. Need three microjumps, now, and I'll have\r\nto cut the last one pretty fine. Now don't bother me.\" He began\r\npunching buttons for data and fiddling with setscrews and verniers.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, in the screen, Trask could see the face of Andray\r\nDunnan. He blinked it away and reached for his cigarettes, and put\r\none in his mouth wrong-end-to. When he reversed it and snapped his\r\nlighter, he saw that his hand was trembling. Otto Harkaman must have\r\nseen that, too.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy, Lucas,\" he whispered. \"Keep your optimism under\r\ncontrol. We only think he might be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he is. He has to be.\"\r\n\r\nNo; that was the way Dunnan, himself, thought. Let's be sane about this.\r\n\r\n\"We have to assume he is. If we do, and he isn't it's a\r\ndisappointment. If we don't, and he is, it's a disaster.\"\r\n\r\nOthers, it seemed, thought the same way. The battle-stations board\r\nwas a solid blaze of red light for full combat readiness.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Kirbey said. \"Jumping.\"\r\n\r\nThen he twisted the red handle to the right and shoved it in\r\nviciously. Again the screen boiled with colored turbulence; again\r\ndark and mighty forces stalked through the ship like demons in a\r\nsorcerer's tower. The screen turned featureless gray as the pickups\r\nstared blindly into some dimensionless noplace. Then it convulsed\r\nwith color again, and this time Ertado's Star, still in the center,\r\nwas a coin-sized disk, with the little sparks of its seven planets\r\nscattered around it. Tanith was the third--the inhabitable planet of\r\na G-class system usually was. It had a single moon, barely visible\r\nin the telescopic screen, five hundred miles in diameter and fifty\r\nthousand off-planet.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" Kirbey said, as though he was afraid to admit it, \"that\r\nwasn't too bad. I think we can make it in one more microjump.\"\r\n\r\nSome time, Trask supposed, he'd be able to use the expression\r\n\"micro-\" about a distance of fifty-five million miles, too.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about it?\" Harkaman asked him, as deferentially\r\nas though seeking expert guidance instead of examining his\r\napprentice. \"Where should Guatt put us?\"\r\n\r\n\"As close as possible, of course.\" That would be a light-second at\r\nthe least; if the _Nemesis_ came out of hyperspace any closer to\r\nanything the size of Tanith, the collapsing field itself would\r\nkick her back. \"We have to assume Dunnan's been there at least\r\nnine hundred hours. By that time, he could have put in a\r\ndetection-station, and maybe missile-launchers, on the moon. The\r\n_Enterprise_ carries four pinnaces, the same as the _Nemesis_; in\r\nhis place, I'd have at least two of them on off-planet patrol. So\r\nlet's accept it that we'll be detected as soon as we come out of\r\nthe last jump, and come out with the moon directly between us and\r\nthe planet. If it's occupied, we can knock it off on the way in.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lot of captains would try to come out with the moon masked off\r\nby the planet,\" Harkaman said.\r\n\r\n\"Would you?\"\r\n\r\nThe big man shook his tousled head. \"No. If they have launchers on\r\nthe moon, they could launch at us in a curve around the planet, by\r\ndata relayed from the other side, and we'd be at a disadvantage\r\nreplying. Just go straight in. You hearing this, Guatt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. It makes sense. Sort of. Now, stop pestering me. Sharll,\r\nlook here a minute.\"\r\n\r\nThe normal-space astrogator conferred with him; Alvyn Karffard, the\r\nexecutive officer, joined them. Finally Kirbey pulled out the big\r\nred handle, twisted it, and said, \"All right, jumping.\" He shoved\r\nit in. \"I suppose I cut it too fine; now we'll get kicked back half\r\na million miles.\"\r\n\r\nThe screen convulsed again; when it cleared the third planet was\r\ndirectly in the center; its small moon, looking almost as large, was\r\na little above and to the right, sunlit on one side and planetlit on\r\nthe other. Kirbey locked the red handle, gathered up his tobacco and\r\nlighter and things from the ledge, and pulled down the cover of the\r\ninstrument-console, locking it.\r\n\r\n\"All yours, Sharll,\" he told Renner.\r\n\r\n\"Eight hours to atmosphere,\" Renner said. \"That's if we don't have\r\nto waste a lot of time shooting up Junior, there.\"\r\n\r\nVann Larch was looking at the moon in the six hundred power screen.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see anything to shoot. Five hundred miles; one\r\nplanetbuster, or four or five thermonuclears,\" he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt wasn't right, Trask thought indignantly. Minutes ago, Tanith had\r\nbeen six and a half billion miles away. Seconds ago, fifty-odd million.\r\nAnd now, a quarter of a million, and looking close enough to touch\r\nin the screen, it would take them eight hours to reach it. Why, on\r\nhyperdrive you could go forty-eight trillion miles in that time.\r\n\r\nWell, it took a man just as long to walk across a room today as it\r\nhad taken Pharaoh the First, or Homo Sap.\r\n\r\nIn the telescopic screen Tanith looked like any picture of any\r\nTerra-type planet from space, with cloud-blurred contours of seas\r\nand continents and a vague mottling of gray and brown and green,\r\ntopped at the pole by an icecap. None of the surface features, not\r\neven the major mountain ranges or rivers, were yet distinguishable,\r\nbut Harkaman and Sharll Renner and Alvyn Karffard and the other old\r\nhands seemed to recognize it. Karffard was talking by phone to Paul\r\nKoreff, the signals-and-detection officer, who could detect nothing\r\nfrom the moon and nothing that was getting through the Van Allen\r\nbelt from the planet.\r\n\r\nMaybe they'd guessed wrong, at that. Maybe Dunnan hadn't gone to\r\nTanith at all.\r\n\r\nHarkaman, who had the knack of putting himself to sleep at will,\r\nwith some sixth or _n_-th sense posted as a sentry, leaned back in\r\nhis chair and closed his eyes. Trask wished he could, too. It would\r\nbe hours before anything happened, and until then he needed all the\r\nrest he could get. He drank more coffee, chain-smoked cigarettes;\r\nhe rose and prowled about the command room, looking at screens.\r\nSignals-and-detection was getting a lot of routine stuff--Van Allen\r\ncount, micrometeor count, surface temperature, gravitation-field\r\nstrength, radar and scanner echoes. He went back to his chair and\r\nsat down, staring at the screen-image. The planet didn't seem to be\r\ngetting any closer at all, and it ought to; they were approaching\r\nit at better than escape velocity. He sat and stared at it.\r\n\r\nHe woke with a start. The screen-image was much larger, now. River\r\ncourses and the shadow lines of mountains were clearly visible. It\r\nmust be early autumn in the northern hemisphere; there was snow down\r\nto the sixtieth parallel and a belt of brown was pushing south\r\nagainst the green. Harkaman was sitting up, eating lunch. By the\r\nclock, it was four hours later.\r\n\r\n\"Have a good nap?\" he asked. \"We're picking up some stuff, now.\r\nRadio and screen signals. Not much, but some. The locals wouldn't\r\nhave learned enough for that in the five years since I was here.\r\nWe didn't stay long enough, for one thing.\"\r\n\r\nOn decivilized planets that were visited by Space Vikings, the\r\nlocals picked up bits and scraps of technology very quickly. In the\r\nfour months of idleness and long conversations while they were in\r\nhyperspace he had heard many stories confirming that. But from the\r\nlevel to which Tanith had sunk, radio and screen communication in\r\nfive years was a little too much of a jump.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't lose any men, did you?\"\r\n\r\nThat happened frequently--men who took up with local women, men who\r\nhad made themselves unpopular with their shipmates, men who just\r\nliked the planet and wanted to stay. They were always welcomed by\r\nthe locals for what they could do and teach.\r\n\r\n\"No, we weren't there long enough for that. Only three hundred and\r\nfifty hours. This we're getting is outside stuff; somebody's there\r\nbeside the locals.\"\r\n\r\nDunnan. He looked again at the battle-stations board; it was still\r\nuniformly red-lighted. Everything was on full combat ready. He\r\nsummoned a mess-robot, selected a couple of dishes, and began\r\nto eat. After the first mouthful, he called to Alvyn Karffard:\r\n\r\n\"Is Paul getting anything new?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nKarffard checked. A little contragravity-field distortion effect.\r\nIt was still too far to be sure. He went back to his lunch. He had\r\nfinished it and was lighting a cigarette over his coffee when a red\r\nlight flashed and a voice from one of the speakers shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Detection! Detection from planet! Radar, and microray!\"\r\n\r\nKarffard began talking rapidly into a hand-phone; Harkaman unhooked\r\none beside him and listened.\r\n\r\n\"Coming from a definite point, about twenty-fifth north parallel,\"\r\nhe said, aside. \"Could be from a ship hiding against the planet.\r\nThere's nothing at all on the moon.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey seemed to be approaching the planet more and more rapidly.\r\nActually, they weren't, the ship was decelerating to get into\r\nan orbit, but the decreasing distance created the illusion of\r\nincreasing speed. The red lights flashed once more.\r\n\r\n\"_Ship detected!_ Just outside atmosphere, coming around the planet\r\nfrom the west.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she the _Enterprise_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't tell, yet,\" Karffard said, and then cried: \"There she is,\r\nin the screen! That spark, about thirty degrees north, just off\r\nthe west side.\"\r\n\r\nAboard her, too, voices from speakers would be shouting, \"Ship\r\ndetected!\" and the battle station board would be blazing red.\r\nAnd Andray Dunnan, at the command-desk--\r\n\r\n\"She's calling us.\" That was Paul Koreff's voice, out of the\r\nsquawk-box on the desk. \"Standard Sword-World impulse-code.\r\nInterrogative: What ship are you? Informative: her screen\r\ncombination. Request: Please communicate.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Harkaman said. \"Let's be polite and communicate.\r\nWhat's her screen-combination?\"\r\n\r\nKoreff's voice gave it, and Harkaman punched it out. The\r\ncommunication screen in front of them lit at once; Trask shoved over\r\nhis chair beside Harkaman's, his hands tightening on the arms. Would\r\nit be Dunnan himself, and what would his face show when he saw who\r\nconfronted him out of his own screen?\r\n\r\nIt took him an instant to realize that the other ship was not the\r\n_Enterprise_ at all. The _Enterprise_ was the _Nemesis'_ twin; her\r\ncommand room was identical with his own. This one was different in\r\narrangements and fittings. The _Enterprise_ was a new ship; this one\r\nwas old, and had suffered for years at the hands of a slack captain\r\nand a slovenly crew.\r\n\r\nAnd the man who sat facing him in the screen was not Andray Dunnan,\r\nor any man he had ever seen before. A dark-faced man, with an old\r\nscar that ran down one cheek from a little below the eye; he had\r\ncurly black hair, on his head and on a V of chest exposed by an open\r\nshirt. There was an ashtray in front of him, and a thin curl of\r\nsmoke rose from a cigar in it, and coffee steamed in an ornate but\r\nbattered silver cup beside it. He was grinning gleefully.\r\n\r\n\"Well! Captain Harkaman, of the _Enterprise_, I believe! Welcome\r\nto Tanith. Who's the gentleman with you? He isn't the Duke of\r\nWardshaven, is he?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe glanced quickly at the showback over the screen, to assure\r\nhimself that his face was not betraying him. Beside him, Otto\r\nHarkaman was laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Captain Valkanhayn; this is an unexpected pleasure. That's\r\nthe _Space Scourge_ you're in, I take it? What are you doing here\r\non Tanith?\"\r\n\r\nA voice from one of the speakers shouted that a second ship had\r\nbeen detected coming over the north pole. The dark-faced man in\r\nthe screen smirked quite complacently.\r\n\r\n\"That's Garvan Spasso, in the _Lamia_,\" he said. \"And what we're\r\ndoing here, we've taken this planet over. We intend keeping it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! So you and Garvan have teamed up. You two were just made for\r\none another. And you have a little planet, all your very own. I'm so\r\nhappy for both of you. What are you getting out of it--beside poultry?\"\r\n\r\nThe other's self-assurance started to slip. He slapped it back into place.\r\n\r\n\"Don't kid me; we know why you're here. Well, we got here first.\r\nTanith is our planet. You think you can take it away from us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know we could, and so do you,\" Harkaman told him. \"We outgun you\r\nand Spasso together; why, a couple of our pinnaces could knock the\r\n_Lamia_ apart. The only question is, do we want to bother?\"\r\n\r\nBy now, he had recovered from his surprise, but not from his\r\ndisappointment. If this fellow thought the _Nemesis_ was the\r\n_Enterprise_--Before he could check himself, he had finished\r\nthe thought aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Then the _Enterprise_ didn't come here at all!\"\r\n\r\nThe man in the screen started. \"Isn't that the _Enterprise_ you're in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. Pardon my remissness, Captain Valkanhayn,\" Harkaman\r\napologized. \"This is the _Nemesis_. The gentleman with me, Lord\r\nLucas Trask, is owner-aboard, for whom I am commanding. Lord Trask,\r\nCaptain Boake Valkanhayn, of the _Space Scourge_. Captain Valkanhayn\r\nis a Space Viking.\" He said that as though expecting it to be\r\ndisputed. \"So, I am told, is his associate, Captain Spasso, whose\r\nship is approaching. You mean to tell me that the _Enterprise_\r\nhasn't been here?\"\r\n\r\nValkanhayn was puzzled, slightly apprehensive.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the Duke of Wardshaven has two ships?\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I know, the Duke of Wardshaven hasn't any ships,\"\r\nHarkaman replied. \"This ship is the property and private adventure\r\nof Lord Trask. The _Enterprise_, for which we are looking, is owned\r\nand commanded by one Andray Dunnan.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the scarred face and hairy chest had picked up his cigar\r\nand was puffing on it mechanically. Now he took it out of his mouth\r\nas though he wondered how it had gotten there in the first place.\r\n\r\n\"But isn't the Duke of Wardshaven sending a ship here to establish\r\na base? That was what we'd heard. We heard you'd gone from Flamberge\r\nto Gram to command for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you hear this? And when?\"\r\n\r\n\"On Hoth. That'd be about two thousand hours ago; a Gilgamesher\r\nbrought the news from Xochitl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, considering it was fifth or sixth hand, your information was\r\ngood enough, when it was fresh. It was a year and a half old when\r\nyou got it, though. How long have you been here on Tanith?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a thousand hours.\" Harkaman clucked sadly at that.\r\n\r\n\"Pity you wasted all that time. Well, it was nice talking to you,\r\nBoake. Say hello to Garvan for me when he comes up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you're not staying?\" Valkanhayn was horrified, an odd\r\nreaction for a man who had just been expecting a bitter battle\r\nto drive them away. \"You're just spacing right out again?\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman shrugged. \"Do we want to waste time here, Lord Trask? The\r\n_Enterprise_ has obviously gone somewhere else. She was still in\r\nhyperspace when Captain Valkanhayn and his accomplice arrived here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything worth staying for?\" That seemed to be the reply\r\nHarkaman was expecting. \"Beside poultry, that is?\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman shook his head. \"This is Captain Valkanhayn's planet; his\r\nand Captain Spasso's. Let them be stuck with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, look; this is a good planet. There's a big local city, maybe\r\nten or twenty thousand people; temples and palaces and everything.\r\nThen, there are a couple of old Federation cities. The one we're at\r\nis in good shape, and there's a big spaceport. We've been doing\r\na lot of work on it. And the locals won't give you any trouble.\r\nAll they have is spears and a few crossbows and matchlocks--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I've been here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, couldn't we make some kind of a deal?\" Valkanhayn asked.\r\nA mendicant whine was beginning to creep into his voice. \"I can\r\nget Garvan on screen and switch him over to your ship--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have a lot of Sword-World merchandise aboard,\" Harkaman\r\nsaid. \"We could make you good prices on some of it. How are you\r\nfixed for robotic equipment?\"\r\n\r\n\"But aren't you going to stay here?\" Valkanhayn was almost in a\r\npanic. \"Listen, suppose I talk to Garvan, and we all get together\r\non this. Just excuse me for a minute--\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had blanked out, Harkaman threw back his head and\r\nguffawed as though he had just heard the funniest and bawdiest joke\r\nin the galaxy. Trask, himself, didn't feel like laughing.\r\n\r\n\"The humor escapes me,\" he admitted. \"We came here on a fools' errand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Lucas.\" Harkaman was still shaking with mirth. \"I know\r\nit's a letdown, but that pair of chiseling chicken thieves! I could\r\nalmost pity them, if it weren't so funny.\" He laughed again. \"You\r\nknow what their idea was?\"\r\n\r\nTrask shook his head. \"Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I called them, a couple of chicken thieves. They raid planets\r\nlike Set and Hertha and Melkarth, where the locals haven't anything\r\nto fight with--or anything worth fighting for. I didn't know they'd\r\nteamed up, but that figures. Nobody else would team up with either\r\nof them. What must have happened, this story of Duke Angus' Tanith\r\nadventure must have filtered out to them, and they thought that if\r\nthey got here first, I'd think it was cheaper to take them in than\r\nrun them out. I probably would have, too. They do have ships, of a\r\nsort, and they do raid, after a fashion. But now, there isn't going\r\nto be any Tanith base, and they have a no-good planet and they're\r\nstuck with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't they make anything out of it themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like what?\" Harkaman hooted. \"They have no equipment, and they have\r\nno men. Not for a job like that. The only thing they can do is space\r\nout and forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could sell them equipment.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could if they had anything to use for money. They haven't. One\r\nthing, we do want to let down and give the men a chance to walk on\r\nground and look at a sky for a while. The girls here aren't too bad,\r\neither,\" Harkaman said. \"As I remember, some of them even take a\r\nbath, now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the kind of news of Dunnan we're going to get. By the time\r\nwe'd get to where he's been reported, he'd be a couple of thousand\r\nlight-years away,\" he said disgustedly. \"I agree; we ought to give\r\nthe men a chance to get off the ship, here. We can stall this pair\r\nalong for a while and we won't have any trouble with them.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe three ships were slowly converging toward a point fifteen\r\nthousand miles off-planet and over the sunset line. The _Space\r\nScourge_ bore the device of a mailed fist clutching a comet by the\r\nhead; it looked more like a whisk broom than a scourge. The _Lamia_\r\nbore a coiled snake with the head, arms and bust of a woman.\r\nValkanhayn and Spasso were taking their time about screening back,\r\nand he began to wonder if they weren't maneuvering the _Nemesis_\r\ninto a cross-fire position. He mentioned this to Harkaman and Alvyn\r\nKarffard; they both laughed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Just holding ship's meetings,\" Karffard said. \"They'll be yakking\r\nback and forth for a couple of hours, yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; Valkanhayn and Spasso don't own their ships,\" Harkaman\r\nexplained. \"They've gone in debt to their crews for supplies and\r\nmaintenance till everybody owns everything in common. The ships\r\nlook like it, too. They don't even command, really; they just\r\npreside over elected command-councils.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, they had both of the more or less commanders on screen.\r\nValkanhayn had zipped up his shirt and put on a jacket. Garvan\r\nSpasso was a small man, partly bald. His eyes were a shade too close\r\ntogether, and his thin mouth had a bitterly crafty twist. He began\r\nspeaking at once:\r\n\r\n\"Captain, Boake tells me you say you're not here in the service of\r\nthe Duke of Wardshaven at all.\" He said it aggrievedly.\r\n\r\n\"That's correct,\" Harkaman said. \"We came here because Lord Trask\r\nthought another Gram ship, the _Enterprise_, would be here. Since\r\nshe isn't, there's no point in our being here. We do hope, though,\r\nthat you won't make any difficulty about our letting down and giving\r\nour men a couple of hundred hours' liberty. They've been in\r\nhyperspace for three thousand hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"See!\" Spasso clamored. \"He wants to trick us into letting him land--\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Captain Spasso,\" Trask cut in. \"Will you please stop insulting\r\neverybody's intelligence, your own included.\" Spasso glared at him,\r\nbelligerently but hopefully. \"I understand what you thought you were\r\ngoing to do here. You expected Captain Harkaman here to establish a\r\nbase for the Duke of Wardshaven, and you thought, if you were here\r\nahead of him and in a posture of defense, that he'd take you into\r\nthe Duke's service rather than waste ammunition and risk damage and\r\ncasualties wiping you out. Well, I'm very sorry, gentlemen. Captain\r\nHarkaman is in my service, and I'm not in the least interested in\r\nestablishing a base on Tanith.\"\r\n\r\nValkanhayn and Spasso looked at each other. At least, in the two\r\nside-by-side screens, their eyes shifted, each to the other's screen\r\non his own ship.\r\n\r\n\"I get it!\" Spasso cried suddenly. \"There's two ships, the\r\n_Enterprise_ and this one. The Duke of Wardshaven fitted out the\r\n_Enterprise_, and somebody else fitted out this one. They both want\r\nto put in a base here!\"\r\n\r\nThat opened a glorious vista. Instead of merely capitalizing on\r\ntheir nuisance-value, they might find themselves holding the balance\r\nof power in a struggle for the planet. All sorts of profitable\r\nperfidies were possible.\r\n\r\n\"Why, sure you can land, Otto,\" Valkanhayn said. \"I know what it's\r\nlike to be three thousand hours in hyper, myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're at this old city with the two tall tower-buildings, aren't\r\nyou?\" Harkaman asked. He looked up at the viewscreen. \"Ought to be\r\nabout midnight there now. How's the spaceport? When I was here, it\r\nwas pretty bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we've been fixing it up. We got a big gang of locals working for us--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city was familiar, from Otto Harkaman's descriptions and from\r\nthe pictures Vann Larch had painted during the long jump from Gram.\r\nAs they came in, it looked impressive, spreading for miles around\r\nthe twin buildings that spired almost three thousand feet above it,\r\nwith a great spaceport like an eight-pointed star at one side.\r\nWhoever had built it, in the sunset splendor of the old Terran\r\nFederation, must have done so confident that it would become the\r\nmetropolis of a populous and prospering world. Then the sun of the\r\nFederation had gone down. Nobody knew what had happened on Tanith\r\nafter that, but evidently none of it had been good.\r\n\r\nAt first, the two towers seemed as sound as when they had been\r\nbuilt; gradually it became apparent that one was broken at the top.\r\nFor the most part, the smaller buildings scattered widely around\r\nthem were standing, though here and there mounds of brush-grown\r\nrubble showed where some had fallen in. The spaceport looked good--a\r\ncentral octagon mass of buildings, the landing-berths, and, beyond,\r\nthe triangular areas of airship docks and warehouses. The central\r\nbuilding was outwardly intact, and the ship-berths seemed clear of\r\nwreckage and rubble.\r\n\r\nBy the time the _Nemesis_ was following the _Space Scourge_ and the\r\n_Lamia_ down, towed by her own pinnaces, the illusion that they were\r\napproaching a living city had vanished. The interspaces between the\r\nbuildings were choked with forest-growth, broken by a few small\r\nfields and garden-plots. At one time, there had been three of the\r\nhigh buildings, literally vertical cities in themselves. Where the\r\nthird had stood was a glazed crater, with a ridge of fallen rubble\r\nlying away from it. Somebody must have landed a medium missile,\r\nabout twenty kilotons, against its base. Something of the same sort\r\nhad scored on the far edge of the spaceport, and one of the eight\r\narrowheads of docks and warehouses was an indistinguishable slag-pile.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the city seemed to have died of neglect rather than\r\nviolence. It certainly hadn't been bombed out. Harkaman thought most\r\nof the fighting had been done with subneutron bombs or Omega-ray\r\nbombs, that killed the people without damaging the real estate. Or\r\nbio-weapons; a man-made plague that had gotten out of control and\r\nall but depopulated the planet.\r\n\r\n\"It takes an awful lot of people, working together at an awful lot\r\nof jobs, to keep a civilization running. Smash the installations and\r\nkill the top technicians and scientists, and the masses don't know\r\nhow to rebuild and go back to stone hatchets. Kill off enough of the\r\nmasses and even if the planet and the know-how is left, there's\r\nnobody to do the work. I've seen planets that decivilized both ways.\r\nTanith, I think, is one of the latter.\"\r\n\r\nThat had been during one of the long after-dinner bull sessions on the\r\nway out from Gram. Somebody, one of the noble gentlemen-adventurers who\r\nhad joined the company after the piracy of the _Enterprise_ and the\r\nmurder, had asked:\r\n\r\n\"But some of them survived. Don't they know what happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"_'In the old times, there were sorcerers. They built the old\r\nbuildings by wizard arts. Then the sorcerers fought among themselves\r\nand went away,'_\" Harkaman said. \"That's all they know about it.\"\r\n\r\nYou could make any kind of an explanation out of that.\r\n\r\nAs the pinnaces pulled and nudged the _Nemesis_ down to her berth,\r\nhe could see people, far down on the spaceport floor, at work.\r\nEither Valkanhayn and Spasso had more men than the size of their\r\nships indicated, or they had gotten a lot of locals to work for\r\nthem. More than the population of the moribund city, at least as\r\nHarkaman remembered it.\r\n\r\nThere had been about five hundred in all; they lived by mining the\r\nold buildings for metal, and trading metalwork for food and textiles\r\nand powder and other things made elsewhere. It was accessible only\r\nby oxcarts traveling a hundred miles across the plains; it had been\r\nbuilt by a contragravity-using people with utter disregard for\r\nnatural travel and transportation routes.\r\n\r\n\"I don't envy the poor buggers,\" Harkaman said, looking down at the\r\nantlike figures on the spaceport floor. \"Boake Valkanhayn and Garvan\r\nSpasso have probably made slaves of the lot of them. If I was really\r\ngoing to put in a base here, I wouldn't thank that pair for the\r\nkind of public-relations work they've been doing among the locals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was just about the situation. Spasso and Valkanhayn and some of\r\ntheir officers met them on the landing stage of the big building in\r\nthe middle of the spaceport, where they had established quarters.\r\nEntering and going down a long hallway, they passed a dozen men and\r\nwomen gathering up rubbish from the floor with shovels and with\r\ntheir hands and putting it into a lifter-skid. Both sexes wore\r\nshapeless garments of coarse cloth, like ponchos, and flat-soled\r\nsandals. Watching them was another local in a kilt, buskins and a\r\nleather jerkin; he wore a short sword on his belt and carried a\r\nwickedly thonged whip. He also wore a Space Viking combat helmet,\r\npainted with the device of Spasso's _Lamia_. He bowed as they\r\napproached, putting a hand to his forehead. After they had passed,\r\nthey could hear him shouting at the others, and the sound of whip-blows.\r\n\r\nYou make slaves out of people, and some will always be slave-drivers;\r\nthey will bow to you, and then take it out on the others. Harkaman's\r\nnose was twitching as though he had a bit of rotten fish caught in\r\nhis mustache.\r\n\r\n\"We have about eight hundred of them. There were only three hundred\r\nthat were any good for work here; we gathered the rest up at villages\r\nalong the big river,\" Spasso was saying.\r\n\r\n\"How do you get food for them?\" Harkaman asked. \"Or don't you bother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we gather that up all over,\" Valkanhayn told him. \"We send\r\nparties out with landing craft. They'll let down on a village, run\r\nthe locals out, gather up what's around and bring it here. Once in\r\na while they put up a fight, but the best they have is a few crossbows\r\nand some muzzle-loading muskets. When they do, we burn the village\r\nand machine-gun everybody we see.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the stuff,\" Harkaman approved. \"If the cow doesn't want to\r\nbe milked, just shoot her. Of course, you don't get much milk out of\r\nher again, but--\"\r\n\r\nThe room to which their hosts guided them was at the far end of the\r\nhall. It had probably been a conference room or something of the\r\nsort, and originally it had been paneled, but the paneling had long\r\nago vanished. Holes had been dug here and there in the walls, and he\r\nremembered having noticed that the door was gone and the metal\r\ngroove in which it had slid had been pried out.\r\n\r\nThere was a big table in the middle, and chairs and couches covered\r\nwith colored spreads. All the furniture was handmade, cunningly\r\npegged together and highly polished. On the walls hung trophies of\r\nweapons--thrusting-spears and throwing-spears, crossbows and quarrels,\r\nand a number of heavy guns, crude things, but carefully made.\r\n\r\n\"Pick all this stuff up off the locals?\" Harkaman asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we got most of it at a big town down at the forks of the\r\nriver,\" Valkanhayn said. \"We shook it down a couple of times. That's\r\nwhere we recruited the fellows we're using to boss the workers.\"\r\n\r\nThen he picked up a stick with a leather-covered knob and beat on a\r\ngong, bawling for wine. A voice, somewhere, replied, \"Yes, master; I\r\ncome!\" and in a few moments a woman entered carrying a jug in either\r\nhand. She was wearing a blue bathrobe several sizes too large for\r\nher, instead of the poncho things the slaves in the hallway wore.\r\nShe had dark brown hair and gray eyes; if she had not been so\r\nobviously frightened she would have been beautiful. She set the jugs\r\non the table and brought silver cups from a chest against the wall:\r\nwhen Spasso dismissed her, she went out hastily.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it's silly to ask if you're paying these people anything\r\nfor the work they do or for the things you take from them,\" Harkaman\r\nsaid. From the way the _Space Scourge_ and _Lamia_ people laughed,\r\nit evidently was. Harkaman shrugged. \"Well, it's your planet. Make\r\nany kind of a mess out of it you want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think we _ought_ to pay them?\" Spasso was incredulous. \"Damn\r\nbunch of savages!\"\r\n\r\n\"They aren't as savage as the Xochitl locals were when Haulteclere\r\ntook it over. You've been there; you've seen what Prince Viktor does\r\nwith them now.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't got the men or equipment they have on Xochitl,\"\r\nValkanhayn said. \"We can't afford to coddle the locals.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't afford not to,\" Harkaman told him. \"You have two ships,\r\nhere. You can only use one for raiding; the other will have to stay\r\nhere to hold the planet. If you take them both away, the locals,\r\nwhom you have been studiously antagonizing, will swamp whoever you\r\nleave behind. And if you don't leave anybody behind, what's the use\r\nof having a planetary base?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why don't you join us,\" Spasso finally came out with it.\r\n\"With our three ships we could have a real thing, here.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman looked at him inquiringly. \"The gentlemen,\" Trask said,\r\n\"are putting this wrongly. They mean, why don't we let them join\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you want to put it like that,\" Valkanhayn conceded. \"We'll\r\nadmit, your _Nemesis_ would be the big end of it. But why not? Three\r\nships, we could have a real base here. Nikky Gratham's father only\r\nhad two when he started on Jagannath, and look what the Grathams got\r\nthere now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we interested?\" Harkaman asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not very, I'm afraid. Of course, we've just landed; Tanith may\r\nhave great possibilities. Suppose we reserve decision for a while\r\nand look around a little.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were stars in the sky, and, for good measure, a sliver of moon\r\non the western horizon. It was only a small moon, but it was close.\r\nHe walked to the edge of the landing stage, and Elaine was walking\r\nwith him. The noise from inside, where the _Nemesis_ crew were\r\nfeasting with those of the _Lamia_ and _Space Scourge_, grew fainter.\r\nTo the south, a star moved; one of the pinnaces they had left on\r\noff-planet watch. There was firelight far below, and he could hear\r\nsinging. Suddenly he realized that it was the poor devils of locals\r\nwhom Valkanhayn and Spasso had enslaved. Elaine went away quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Have your fill of Space Viking glamour, Lucas?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned. It was Baron Rathmore, who had come along to serve for a\r\nyear or so and then hitch a ride home from some base planet and cash\r\nin politically on having been with Lucas Trask.\r\n\r\n\"For the moment. I'm told that this lot aren't typical.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not. They're a pack of sadistic brutes, and piggish along\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, brutality and bad manners I can condone, but Spasso and\r\nValkanhayn are a pair of ignominious little crooks, and stupid along\r\nwith it. If Andray Dunnan had gotten here ahead of us, he might have\r\ndone one good thing in his wretched life. I can't understand why he\r\ndidn't come here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he still will,\" Rathmore said. \"I knew him and I knew\r\nNevil Ormm. Ormm's ambitious, and Dunnan is insanely vindictive--\"\r\nHe broke off with a sour laugh. \"I'm telling _you_ that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't he come here directly, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he doesn't want a base on Tanith. That would be something\r\nconstructive; Dunnan's a destroyer. I think he took that cargo of\r\nequipment somewhere and sold it. I think he'll wait till he's fairly\r\nsure the other ship is finished. Then he'll come in and shoot the\r\nplace up, the way--\" He bit that off abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"The way he did my wedding; I think of it all the time.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning, he and Harkaman took an aircar and went to look\r\nat the city at the forks of the river. It was completely new, in\r\nthe sense that it had been built since the collapse of Federation\r\ncivilization and the loss of civilized technologies. It was huddled\r\non a long, irregularly triangular mound, evidently to raise it above\r\nflood-level. Generations of labor must have gone into it. To the\r\neyes of a civilization using contragravity and powered equipment it\r\nwasn't at all impressive. Fifty to a hundred men with adequate\r\nequipment could have gotten the thing up in a summer. It was only\r\nby forcing himself to think in terms of spadeful after spadeful of\r\nearth, cartload after cartload creaking behind straining beasts,\r\ntimber after timber cut with axes and dressed with adzes, stone\r\nafter stone and brick after brick, that he could appreciate it. They\r\neven had it walled, with a palisade of tree-trunks behind which\r\nearth and rocks had been banked, and along the river were docks,\r\nat which boats were moored. The locals simply called it Tradetown.\r\n\r\nAs they approached, a big gong began booming, and a white puff of\r\nsmoke was followed by the thud of a signal-gun. The boats, long\r\ncanoe-like craft and round-bowed, many-oared barges, put out hastily\r\ninto the river; through binoculars they could see people scattering\r\nfrom the surrounding fields, driving cattle ahead of them. By the\r\ntime they were over the city, nobody was in sight. They seemed\r\nto have developed a pretty fair air-raid warning system in the\r\nnine-hundred-odd hours in which they had been exposed to the\r\nfigurative mercies of Boake Valkanhayn and Garvan Spasso. It hadn't\r\nsaved them entirely; a section of the city had been burned, and\r\nthere were evidences of shelling. Light chemical-explosive stuff;\r\nthis city was too good a cow for even those two to kill before the\r\nmilking was over.\r\n\r\nThey circled slowly over it at a thousand feet. When they turned\r\naway, black smoke began rising from what might have been pottery\r\nworks or brick-kilns on the outskirts; something resinous had\r\nevidently been fed to the fires. Other columns of black smoke began\r\nrising across the countryside on both sides of the river.\r\n\r\n\"You know, these people are civilized, if you don't limit the term\r\nto contragravity and nuclear energy,\" Harkaman said. \"They have\r\ngunpowder, for one thing, and I can think of some rather impressive\r\nOld Terran civilizations that didn't have that much. They have an\r\norganized society, and anybody who has that is starting toward\r\ncivilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate to think of what'll happen to this planet if Spasso and\r\nValkanhayn stay here long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might be a good thing, in the long run. Good things in the long run\r\nare often tough while they're happening. I know what'll happen to\r\nSpasso and Valkanhayn, though. They'll start decivilizing, themselves.\r\nThey'll stay here for a while, and when they need something they\r\ncan't take from the locals they'll go chicken-stealing after it,\r\nbut most of the time they'll stay here lording it over their slaves,\r\nand finally their ships will wear out and they won't be able to fix\r\nthem. Then, some time, the locals'll jump them when they aren't\r\nwatching and wipe them out. But in the meantime, the locals'll\r\nlearn a lot from them.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned the aircar west again along the river. They looked at a\r\nfew villages. One or two dated from the Federation period; they had\r\nbeen plantations before whatever it was had happened. More had been\r\nbuilt within the past five centuries. A couple had recently been\r\ndestroyed, in punishment for the crime of self-defense.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, at length, \"I'm going to do everybody a favor.\r\nI'm going to let Spasso and Valkanhayn persuade me to take this\r\nplanet away from them.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman, who was piloting, turned sharply. \"You crazy or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"'When somebody makes a statement you don't understand, don't tell\r\nhim he's crazy. Ask him what he means.' Who said that?\"\r\n\r\n\"On target,\" Harkaman grinned. \"'What _do_ you mean, Lord Trask?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't catch Dunnan by pursuit; I'll have to get him by\r\ninterception. You know the source of that quotation, too. This looks\r\nto me like a good place to intercept him. When he learns I have a\r\nbase here, he'll hit it, sooner or later. And even if he doesn't,\r\nwe can pick up more information on him, when ships start coming in\r\nhere, than we would batting around all over the Old Federation.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman considered for a moment, then nodded. \"Yes, if we could set\r\nup a base like Nergal or Xochitl,\" he agreed. \"There'll be four or\r\nfive ships, Space Vikings, traders, Gilgameshers and so on, on\r\neither of those planets all the time. If we had the cargo Dunnan\r\ntook to space in the _Enterprise_, we could start a base like that.\r\nBut we haven't anything near what we need, and you know what Spasso\r\nand Valkanhayn have.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can get it from Gram. As it stands, the investors in the Tanith\r\nAdventure, from Duke Angus down, lost everything they put into it.\r\nIf they're willing to throw some good money after bad, they can get\r\nit back, and a handsome profit to boot. And there ought to be\r\nplanets above the rowboat and ox-cart level not too far away that\r\ncould be raided for a lot of things we'd need.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right; I know of half a dozen within five hundred light-years.\r\nThey won't be the kind Spasso and Valkanhayn are in the habit of\r\nraiding, though. And besides machinery, we can get gold, and valuable\r\nmerchandise that could be sold on Gram. And if we could make a go of\r\nit, you'd go farther hunting Dunnan by sitting here on Tanith than by\r\ngoing looking for him. That was the way we used to hunt marsh pigs on\r\nColada, when I was a kid; just find a good place and sit down and wait.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had Valkanhayn and Spasso aboard the _Nemesis_ for dinner; it\r\ndidn't take much guiding to keep the conversation on the subject of\r\nTanith and its resources, advantages and possibilities. Finally,\r\nwhen they had reached brandy and coffee, Trask said idly:\r\n\r\n\"I believe, together, we could really make something out of this planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what we've been telling you, all along,\" Spasso broke in\r\neagerly. \"This is a wonderful planet--\"\r\n\r\n\"It could be. All it has now is possibilities. We'd need a\r\nspaceport, for one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's this, here?\" Valkanhayn wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"It was a spaceport,\" Harkaman told him. \"It could be one again. And\r\nwe'd need a shipyard, capable of any kind of heavy repair work.\r\nCapable of building a complete ship, in fact. I never saw a ship\r\ncome into a Viking base planet with any kind of a cargo worth\r\ndickering over that hadn't taken some damage getting it. Prince\r\nViktor of Xochitl makes a good half of his money on ship repairs,\r\nand so do Nikky Gratham on Jagannath and the Everrards on Hoth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And engine works, hyperdrive, normal space and pseudograv,\" Trask\r\nadded. \"And a steel mill, and a collapsed-matter plant. And\r\nrobotic-equipment works, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's out of all reason!\" Valkanhayn cried. \"It would take\r\ntwenty trips with a ship the size of this one to get all that stuff\r\nhere, and how'd we ever be able to pay for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the sort of base Duke Angus of Wardshaven planned. The\r\n_Enterprise_, practically a duplicate of the _Nemesis_, carried\r\neverything that would be needed to get it started, when she was\r\npirated.\"\r\n\r\n\"When she was--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you're going to have to tell the gentlemen the truth,\"\r\nHarkaman chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"I intend to.\" He laid his cigar down, sipped some of his brandy,\r\nand explained about Duke Angus' Tanith adventure. \"It was part of a\r\nlarger plan; Angus wanted to gain economic supremacy for Wardshaven\r\nto forward his political ambitions. It was, however, an entirely\r\npractical business proposition. I was opposed to it, because I\r\nthought it would be too good a proposition for Tanith and work to\r\nthe disadvantage of the home planet in the end.\" He told them about\r\nthe _Enterprise_, and the cargo of industrial and construction\r\nequipment she carried, and then told them how Andray Dunnan had\r\npirated her.\r\n\r\n\"That wouldn't have annoyed me at all; I had no money invested in\r\nthe project. What did annoy me, to put it mildly, was that just\r\nbefore he took the ship out, Dunnan shot up my wedding, wounded me\r\nand my father-in-law, and killed the lady to whom I had been married\r\nfor less than half an hour. I fitted out this ship at my own\r\nexpense, took on Captain Harkaman, who had been left without a\r\ncommand when the _Enterprise_ was pirated, and came out here to\r\nhunt Dunnan down and kill him. I believe that I can do that best by\r\nestablishing a base on Tanith myself. The base will have to be\r\noperated at a profit, or it can't be operated at all.\" He picked up\r\nthe cigar again and puffed slowly. \"I am inviting you gentlemen to\r\njoin me as partners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you still haven't told us how we're going to get the money to\r\nfinance it,\" Spasso insisted.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Wardshaven, and the others who invested in the original\r\nTanith adventure will put it up. It's the only way they can recover\r\nwhat they lost on the _Enterprise_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then, this Duke of Wardshaven will be running it, not us,\"\r\nValkanhayn objected.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Wardshaven,\" Harkaman reminded him, \"is on Gram. We are\r\nhere on Tanith. There are three thousand light-years between.\"\r\n\r\nThat seemed a satisfactory answer. Spasso, however, wanted to know\r\nwho would run things here on Tanith.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to hold a meeting of all three crews,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"We will do nothing of the kind,\" Trask told him. \"I will be running\r\nthings here on Tanith. You people may allow your orders to be\r\ndebated and voted on, but I don't. You will inform your respective\r\ncrews to that effect. Any orders you give them in my name will be\r\nobeyed without argument.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how the men'll take that,\" Valkanhayn said.\r\n\r\n\"I know how they'll take it if they're smart,\" Harkaman told him.\r\n\"And I know what'll happen if they aren't. I know how you've been\r\nrunning your ships, or how your ships' crews have been running you.\r\nWell, we don't do it that way. Lucas Trask is owner, and I'm\r\ncaptain. I obey his orders on what's to be done, and everybody else\r\nobeys mine on how to do it.\"\r\n\r\nSpasso looked at Valkanhayn, then shrugged. \"That's how the man\r\nwants it, Boake. You want to give him an argument? I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first order,\" Trask said, \"is that these people you have\r\nworking here are to be paid. They are not to be beaten by these\r\nplug-uglies you have guarding them. If any of them want to leave,\r\nthey may do so; they will be given presents and furnished\r\ntransportation home. Those who wish to stay will be issued rations,\r\nfurnished with clothing and bedding and so on as they need it, and\r\npaid wages. We'll work out some kind of a pay-token system and set\r\nup a commissary where they can buy things.\"\r\n\r\nDisks of plastic or titanium or something, stamped and\r\nuncounterfeitable. Get Alvyn Karffard to see about that. Organize\r\nwork-gangs, and promote the best and most intelligent to foremen.\r\nAnd those guards could be taken in hand by some ground-fighter\r\nsergeant and given Sword-World weapons and tactical training; use\r\nthem to train others; they'd need a sepoy army of some sort. Even\r\nthe best of good will is no substitute for armed force,\r\nconspicuously displayed and unhesitatingly used when necessary.\r\n\r\n\"And there'll be no more of this raiding villages for food or\r\nanything else. We will pay for anything we get from any of the\r\nlocals.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have trouble about that,\" Valkanhayn predicted. \"Our men\r\nthink anything a local has belongs to anybody who can take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" Harkaman said. \"On a planet I'm raiding. This is our\r\nplanet, and our locals. We don't raid our own planet or our own\r\npeople. You'll just have to teach them that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took Valkanhayn and Spasso more time and argument to convince\r\ntheir crews than Trask thought necessary. Harkaman seemed satisfied,\r\nand so was Baron Rathmore, the Wardshaven politician.\r\n\r\n\"It's like talking a lot of uncommitted small landholders into\r\ntaking somebody's livery-and-maintenance,\" the latter said. \"You\r\ncan't use too much pressure; make them think it's their own idea.\"\r\n\r\nThere were meetings of both crews, with heated arguments; Baron\r\nRathmore made frequent speeches, while Lord Trask of Tanith and\r\nAdmiral Harkaman--the titles were Rathmore's suggestion--remained\r\nloftily aloof. On both ships, everybody owned everything in common,\r\nwhich meant that nobody owned anything. They had taken over Tanith\r\non the same basis of diffused ownership, and nobody in either crew\r\nwas quite stupid enough to think that they could do anything with\r\nthe planet by themselves. By joining the _Nemesis_, it appeared that\r\nthey were getting something for nothing. In the end, they voted to\r\nplace themselves under the authority of Lord Trask and Admiral\r\nHarkaman. After all, Tanith would be a feudal lordship, and the\r\nthree ships together a fleet.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Harkaman's first act of authority was to order a general\r\ninspection of fleet units. He wasn't shocked by the condition of the\r\ntwo ships, but that was only because he had expected much worse. They\r\nwere spaceworthy; after all, they had gotten here from Hoth under\r\ntheir own power. They were only combat-worthy if the combat weren't\r\ntoo severe. His original estimate that the _Nemesis_ could have\r\nknocked both of them to pieces was, if anything, over-conservative.\r\nThe engines were only in fair shape, and the armament was bad.\r\n\r\n\"We aren't going to spend our time sitting here on Tanith,\" he told\r\nthe two captains. \"This planet is a raiding base, and 'raiding' is\r\nthe operative word. And we are not going to raid easy planets. A\r\nplanet that can be raided with impunity isn't worth the time it takes\r\ngetting to it. We are going to have to fight on every planet we hit,\r\nand I am not going to jeopardize the lives of the men under me,\r\nwhich includes your crews as well as mine, because of under-powered\r\nand under-armed ships.\"\r\n\r\nSpasso tried to argue. \"We've been getting along.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman cursed. \"Yes. I know how you've been getting along;\r\nchicken-stealing on planets like Set and Xipototec and Melkarth. Not\r\nmaking enough to cover maintenance expenses; that's why your ship's\r\nin the shape she is. Well, those days are over. Both ships ought to\r\nhave a full overhaul, but we'll have to skip that till we have a\r\nshipyard of our own. But I will insist, at least, that your guns and\r\nlaunchers are in order. And your detection equipment; you didn't get\r\na fix on the _Nemesis_ till we were less than twenty thousand miles\r\noff-planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better get the _Lamia_ in condition first,\" Trask said. \"We\r\ncan put her on off-planet watch, instead of that pair of pinnaces.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWork on the _Lamia_ started the next day, and considerable friction-heat\r\nwas generated between her officers and the engineers sent over from\r\nthe _Nemesis_. Baron Rathmore went aboard, and came back laughing.\r\n\r\n\"You know how that ship's run?\" he asked. \"There's a sort of soviet\r\nof officers; chief engineer, exec, guns-and-missiles, astrogator and\r\nso on. Spasso's just an animated ventriloquist's dummy. I talked to\r\nall of them. None of them can pin me down to anything, but they\r\nthink we're going to heave Spasso out of command and appoint one of\r\nthem, and each one thinks he'll be it. I don't know how long that'll\r\nlast, it's a string-and-tape job like the one we're having to do on\r\nthe ship. It'll hold till we get something better.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to get rid of Spasso,\" Harkaman agreed. \"I think we'll\r\nput one of our own people in his place. Valkanhayn can stay in\r\ncommand of the _Space Scourge_; he's a spaceman. But Spasso's no\r\ngood for anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe local problem was complicated, too. The locals spoke Lingua\r\nTerra of a sort, like every descendant of the race that had gone out\r\nfrom the Sol system in the Third Century, but it was a barely\r\ncomprehensible sort. On civilized planets, the language had been\r\nfrozen unalterably in microbooks and voice tapes. But microbooks can\r\nonly be read and sound tapes heard with the aid of electricity, and\r\nTanith had lost that long ago.\r\n\r\nMost of the people Spasso and Valkanhayn had kidnaped and enslaved\r\ncame from villages within a radius of five hundred miles. About half\r\nof them wanted to be repatriated; they were given gifts of knives,\r\ntools, blankets, and bits of metal which seemed to be the chief\r\nstandard of value and medium of exchange, and shipped home. Finding\r\ntheir proper villages was not easy. At each such village, the news\r\nwas spread that the Space Vikings would hereafter pay for what they\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThe _Lamia_ was overhauled as rapidly as possible. She was still\r\nfar from being a good ship, but she was much closer to being one than\r\nbefore. She was fitted with the best detection equipment that could\r\nbe assembled, and put on orbit; Alvyn Karffard took command of her,\r\nwith some of Spasso's officers, some of Valkanhayn's, and a few from\r\nthe _Nemesis_. Harkaman was intending to use her for retraining of\r\nall the _Lamia_ and _Space Scourge_ officers, and rotated them back\r\nand forth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe labor guards, a score in number, were relieved of their duties,\r\nissued Sword-World firearms, and given intensive training. The trade\r\ntokens, stamps of colored plastic, were introduced, and a store was\r\nset up where they could be exchanged for Sword-World items. After a\r\nwhile, it dawned on the locals that the tokens could also be used\r\nfor trading among themselves; money seemed to have been one of the\r\nadjuncts of civilization that had been lost along Tanith's downward\r\npath. A few of them were able to use contragravity hand-lifters and\r\nhand-towed lifter-skids; several were even learning to operate\r\nthings like bulldozers, at least to the extent of knowing which\r\nlever or button did what. Give them a little time, Trask thought,\r\nwatching a gang at work down on the spaceport floor. It won't be\r\nmany years before half of them will be piloting aircars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as the _Lamia_ was on orbital watch, the _Space Scourge_ was\r\nset down at the spaceport and work started on her. It was decided\r\nthat Valkanhayn would take her to Gram; enough _Nemesis_ people\r\nwould go along to insure good faith on his part, and to talk to Duke\r\nAngus and the Tanith investors. Baron Rathmore, and Paytrik Morland,\r\nand several other Wardshaven gentlemen-adventurers for the latter\r\nfunction; Alvyn Karffard to act as Valkanhayn's exec, with private\r\norders to supersede him in command if necessary, and Guatt Kirbey\r\nto do the astrogating.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to take the _Nemesis_ and the _Space Scourge_ out,\r\nfirst, and make a big raid,\" Harkaman said. \"We can't send the\r\n_Space Scourge_ back to Gram empty. When Baron Rathmore and Lord\r\nValpry and the rest of them talk to Duke Angus and the Tanith\r\ninvestors, they'll have to have a lot more than some travel films\r\nof Tanith. They'll have to be able to show that Tanith is producing.\r\nWe ought to have a little money of our own to invest, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Otto; both ships?\" That worried Trask. \"Suppose Dunnan comes\r\nand finds nobody here but Spasso and the _Lamia_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chance we'll have to take. Personally, I think we have a year to a\r\nyear and a half before Dunnan shows up here. I know, we were fooled\r\ntrying to guess what he'd do before. But the sort of raid I have in\r\nmind, we'll need two ships, and in any case, I don't want to leave\r\nboth those ships here while we're gone, even if you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"When it comes to that, I don't think I do, either. But we can't\r\ntrust Spasso here alone, can we?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll leave enough of our people to make sure. We'll leave\r\nAlvyn--that'll mean a lot of work for me that he'd otherwise do,\r\non the ship. And Baron Rathmore, and young Valpry, and the men\r\nwho've been training our sepoys. We can shuffle things around and\r\nleave some of Valkanhayn's men in place of some of Spasso's. We might\r\neven talk Spasso into going along. That'll mean having to endure him\r\nat our table, but it would be wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you picked a place to raid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three of them. First, Khepera. That's only thirty light-years from\r\nhere. That won't amount to much; just chicken-stealing. It'll give\r\nour green hands some relatively safe combat-training, and it'll give\r\nus some idea of how Spasso's and Valkanhayn's people behave, and\r\ngive them confidence for the next job.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Amaterasu. My information about Amaterasu is about twenty years\r\nold. A lot of things can happen in twenty years. All I know of it--I\r\nwas never there myself--is it's fairly civilized--about like Terra\r\njust before the beginning of the Atomic Era. No nuclear energy, they\r\nlost that, and of course nothing beyond it, but they have hydroelectric\r\nand solarelectric power, and nonnuclear jet aircraft, and some very good\r\nchemical-explosive weapons, which they use very freely on each other.\r\nIt was last known to have been raided by a ship from Excalibur\r\ntwenty years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds promising. And the third planet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beowulf. We won't take enough damage on Amaterasu to make any\r\ndifference there, but if we saved Amaterasu for last, we might\r\nbe needing too many repairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They have nuclear energy. I don't think it would be wise to\r\nmention Beowulf to Captains Spasso and Valkanhayn. Wait till we've\r\nhit Khepera and Amaterasu. They may be feeling like heroes, then.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nKhepera left a bad taste in Trask's mouth. He was still tasting it\r\nwhen the colored turbulence died out of the screen and left the gray\r\nnothingness of hyperspace. Garvan Spasso--they had had no trouble in\r\ninducing him to come along--was staring avidly at the screen as\r\nthough he could still see the ravished planet they had left.\r\n\r\n\"That was a good one; that was a good one!\" he was crowing. He'd\r\nsaid that a dozen times since they had lifted out. \"Three cities in\r\nfive days, and all the stuff we gathered up around them. We took\r\nover two million stellars.\"\r\n\r\nAnd did ten times as much damage getting it, and there was no scale\r\nof values by which to compute the death and suffering.\r\n\r\n\"Knock it off, Spasso. You said that before.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a time when he wouldn't have spoken to the fellow, or\r\nanybody else, like that. Gresham's law, extended: Bad manners drive\r\nout good manners. Spasso turned on him indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you think you are--?\"\r\n\r\n\"He thinks he's Lord Trask of Tanith,\" Harkaman said. \"He's right,\r\ntoo; he is.\" He looked searchingly at Trask for a moment, then\r\nturned back to Spasso. \"I'm just as tired as he is of hearing you\r\npop your mouth about a lousy two million stellars. Nearer a million\r\nand a half, but two million's nothing to pop about. Maybe it would\r\nbe for the _Lamia_, but we have a three-ship fleet and a planetary\r\nbase to meet expenses on. Out of this raid, a ground-fighter or an\r\nable spaceman will get a hundred and fifty stellars. We'll get about\r\na thousand, ourselves. How long do you think we can stay in business\r\ndoing this kind of chicken-stealing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You call this chicken-stealing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I call it chicken-stealing, and so'll you before we get back to\r\nTanith. If you live that long.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Spasso was still affronted. Then, temporarily, his\r\nvulpine face showed avaricious hope, and then apprehension.\r\nEvidently he knew Otto Harkaman's reputation, and some of the things\r\nHarkaman had done weren't his idea of an easy way to make money.\r\n\r\nKhepera had been easy; the locals hadn't had anything to fight with.\r\nSmall arms, and light cannon which hadn't been able to fire more\r\nthan a few rounds. Wherever they had attempted resistance, the\r\ncombat cars had swooped in, dropping bombs and firing machine guns\r\nand auto-cannon. Yet they had fought, bitterly and hopelessly--just\r\nas he would have, defending Traskon.\r\n\r\nTrask busied himself getting coffee and a cigarette from one of the\r\nrobots. When he looked up, Spasso had gone away, and Harkaman was\r\nsitting on the edge of the desk, loading his short pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you saw the elephant, Lucas,\" Harkaman said. \"You don't seem\r\nto have liked it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elephant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Terran expression I read somewhere. All I know is that an\r\nelephant was an animal about the size of one of your Gram megatheres.\r\nThe expression means, experiencing something for the first time\r\nwhich makes a great impression. Elephants must have been something\r\nto see. This was your first Viking raid. You've seen it, now.\"\r\n\r\nHe'd been in combat before; he'd led the fighting-men of Traskon\r\nduring the boundary dispute with Baron Manniwel, and there were\r\nalways bandits and cattle rustlers. He'd thought it would be like\r\nthat. He remembered, five days, or was it five ages, ago, his\r\nexcited anticipation as the city grew and spread in the screen and\r\nthe _Nemesis_ came dropping down toward it. The pinnaces, his four\r\nand the two from the _Space Scourge_, had gone spiraling out a\r\nhundred miles beyond the city; the _Space Scourge_ had gone into\r\na tighter circle twenty miles from its center; the _Nemesis_ had\r\ncontinued her relentless descent until she was ten miles from the\r\nground, before she began spewing out landing craft, and combat cars,\r\nand the little egg-shaped one-man air-cavalry mounts. It had been\r\nthrilling. Everything had gone perfectly; not even Valkanhayn's gang\r\nhad goofed.\r\n\r\nThen the screenviews had begun coming in. The brief and hopeless\r\nfight in the city. He could still see that silly little field gun,\r\nit must have been around seventy or eighty millimeter, on a\r\nhigh-wheeled carriage, drawn by six shaggy, bandy-legged beasts.\r\nThey had gotten it unlimbered and were trying to get it on a target\r\nwhen a rocket from an aircar landed directly under the muzzle. Gun,\r\ncaisson, crew, even the draft team fifty yards behind, had simply\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nOr the little company, some of them women, trying to defend the top\r\nof a tall and half-ruinous building with rifles and pistols. One\r\nair-cavalryman wiped them all out with his machine guns.\r\n\r\n\"They don't have a chance,\" he'd said, half-sick. \"But they keep on\r\nfighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; stupid of them, isn't it?\" Harkaman, beside him, had said.\r\n\r\n\"What would you do in their place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fight. Try to kill as many Space Vikings as I could before they got\r\nme. Terro-humans are all stupid like that. That's why we're human.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the taking of the city had been a massacre, the sack that had\r\nfollowed had been a man-made Hell. He had gone down, along with\r\nHarkaman, while the fighting, if it could be so called, was still\r\ngoing on. Harkaman had suggested that the men ought to see him\r\nmoving about among them; for his own part, he had felt a compulsion\r\nto share their guilt.\r\n\r\nHe and Sir Paytrik Morland had been on foot together in one of the\r\nbig hollow buildings that had stood since Khepera had been a Member\r\nRepublic of the Terran Federation. The air was acrid with smoke,\r\npowder smoke and the smoke of burning. It was surprising, how much\r\nwould burn, in this city of concrete and vitrified stone. It was\r\nsurprising, too, how well-kept everything was, at least on the\r\nground level. These people had taken pride in their city.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves alone, in a great empty hallway; the noise and\r\nhorror of the sack had moved away from them, or they from it, and\r\nthen, when they entered a side hall, they saw a man, one of the\r\nlocals, squatting on the floor with the body of a woman cradled on\r\nhis lap. She was dead, half her head had been blown off, but he was\r\nclasping her tightly, her blood staining his shirt, and sobbing\r\nheartbrokenly. A carbine lay forgotten on the floor beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Poor devil,\" Morland said, and started forward.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nTrask stopped him with his left hand. With his right, he drew his\r\npistol and shot the man dead. Morland was horrified.\r\n\r\n\"Great Satan, Lucas! Why did you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish Andray Dunnan had done that for me.\" He thumbed the safety\r\non and holstered the pistol. \"None of this would be happening if\r\nhe had. How many more happinesses do you think we've smashed here\r\ntoday? And we don't even have Dunnan's excuse of madness.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, with everything of value collected and sent\r\naboard, they had started cross-country for five hundred miles to\r\nanother city, the first hundred over a countryside asmoke from\r\nburning villages Valkanhayn's men had pillaged the night before.\r\nThere was no warning; Khepera had lost electricity and radio and\r\ntelegraph, and the spread of news was at the speed of one of the\r\nbeasts the locals insisted on calling horses. By midafternoon, they\r\nhad finished with that city. It had been as bad as the first one.\r\n\r\nOne thing, it was the center of a considerable cattle country. The\r\ncattle were native to the planet, heavy-bodied unicorns the size of\r\na Gram bisonoid or one of the slightly mutated Terran carabaos on\r\nTanith, with long hair like a Terran yak. He had detailed a dozen of\r\nthe _Nemesis_ ground-fighters who had been vaqueros on his Traskon\r\nranches to collect a score of cows and four likely bulls, with\r\nenough fodder to last them on the voyage. The odds were strongly\r\nagainst any of them living to acclimate themselves to Tanith, but\r\nif they did, they might prove to be one of the most valuable pieces\r\nof loot from Khepera.\r\n\r\nThe third city was at the forks of a river, like Tradetown on\r\nTanith. Unlike it, this was a real metropolis. They should have\r\ngone there first of all. They spent two days systematically pillaging\r\nit. The Kheperans carried on considerable river-traffic, with\r\nstern-wheel steamboats, and the waterfront was lined with warehouses\r\ncrammed with every sort of merchandise. Even better, the Kheperans\r\nhad money, and for the most part it was gold specie, and the bank\r\nvaults were full of it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the city had been built since the fall of the\r\nFederation and the climb up from the barbarism that had followed,\r\nand a great deal of it was of wood. Fires started almost at once,\r\nand it was almost completely on fire by the end of the second day.\r\nIt had been visible in the telescopic screen even after they were\r\nout of atmosphere, a black smear until the turning planet carried\r\nit into darkness and then a lurid glow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It was a filthy business.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman nodded. \"Robbery and murder always are. You don't have to\r\nask me who said that Space Vikings are professional robbers and\r\nmurderers, but who was it said that he didn't care how many planets\r\nwere raided and how many innocents massacred in the Old Federation?\"\r\n\r\n\"A dead man. Lucas Trask of Traskon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wish, now, that you'd kept Traskon and stayed on Gram?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. If I had, I'd have spent every hour wishing I was doing what\r\nI'm doing now. I can get used to this, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you will. At least, you kept your rations down. I didn't on\r\nmy first raid, and had bad dreams about it for a year.\" He gave his\r\ncoffee cup back to the robot and got to his feet. \"Get a little\r\nrest, for a couple of hours. Then draw some alcodote-vitamin pills\r\nfrom the medic. As soon as things are secured, there'll be parties\r\nall over the ship, and we'll be expected to look in on every one of\r\nthem, have a drink, and say 'Well done, boys.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElaine came to him, while he was resting. She looked at him in\r\nhorror, and he tried to hide his face from her, and then realized\r\nthat he was trying to hide it from himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThey came straight down on Eglonsby, on Amaterasu, the _Nemesis_\r\nand the _Space Scourge_ side by side. The radar had picked them up\r\nat point-five light-seconds; by this time the whole planet knew\r\nthey were coming, and nobody was wondering why. Paul Koreff was\r\nmonitoring at least twenty radio stations, assigning somebody to\r\neach one as it was identified. What was coming in was uniformly\r\nexcited, some panicky, and all in fairly standard Lingua Terra.\r\n\r\nGarvan Spasso was perturbed. So, in the communication screen from\r\nthe _Space Scourge_, was Boake Valkanhayn.\r\n\r\n\"They got radio, and they got radar,\" he clamored.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so what?\" Harkaman asked. \"They had radio and radar twenty\r\nyears ago, when Rock Morgan was here in the _Coalsack_. But they\r\ndon't have nuclear energy, do they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no. I'm picking up a lot of industrial electrical discharge,\r\nbut nothing nuclear.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. A man with a club can lick a man with his fists. A man\r\nwith a gun can lick half a dozen with clubs. And two ships with\r\nnuclear weapons can lick a whole planet without them. Think it's\r\ntime, Lucas?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"Paul, can you cut in on that Eglonsby station yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Valkanhayn wanted to know, against it\r\nin advance.\r\n\r\n\"Summon them to surrender. If they don't, we will drop a hellburner,\r\nand then we will pick out another city and summon it to surrender.\r\nI don't think the second one will refuse. If we are going to be\r\nmurderers, we'll do it right, this time.\"\r\n\r\nValkanhayn was aghast, probably at the idea of burning an unlooted\r\ncity. Spasso was sputtering something about, \"... Teach the dirty\r\nNeobarbs a lesson--\" Koreff told him he was switched on. He picked\r\nup a hand-phone.\r\n\r\n\"Space Vikings _Nemesis_ and _Space Scourge_, calling the city of\r\nEglonsby. Space Vikings....\"\r\n\r\nHe repeated it for over a minute; there was no reply.\r\n\r\n\"Vann,\" he called Guns-and-Missiles. \"A subcrit display job, about\r\nfour miles over the city.\"\r\n\r\nHe laid the phone down and looked to the underside viewscreen. A\r\nlittle later, a silvery shape dropped away from the ship's south\r\npole. The telescopic screen went off, and the unmagnified screen\r\ndarkened as the filters went on. Valkanhayn, aboard the other ship,\r\nwas shouting a warning about his own screens. The only unfiltered\r\nscreen aboard the _Nemesis_ was the one tuned to the falling\r\nmissile. The city of Eglonsby rushed upward in it, and then it went\r\nsuddenly dark. There was an orange-yellow blaze in the other\r\nscreens. After a while, the filters went off and the telescopic\r\nscreen went on again. He picked up the phone.\r\n\r\n\"Space Vikings calling Eglonsby; this is your last warning.\r\nCommunicate at once.\"\r\n\r\nLess than a minute later, a voice came out of one of the speakers:\r\n\r\n\"Eglonsby calling Space Vikings. Your bomb has done great damage.\r\nWill you hold your fire until somebody in authority can communicate\r\nwith you? This is the chief operator at the central State telecast\r\nstation; I have no authority to say anything to you, or discuss\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good, that sounds like a dictatorship,\" Harkaman was saying.\r\n\"Grab the dictator and shove a pistol in his face and you have\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to discuss. Get somebody who has authority to\r\nsurrender the city to us. If this is not done within the hour,\r\nthe city and everybody in it will be obliterated.\"\r\n\r\nOnly minutes later, a new voice said:\r\n\r\n\"This is Gunsalis Jan, secretary to Pedrosan Pedro, President of\r\nthe Council of Syndics. We will switch President Pedrosan over as\r\nsoon as he can speak directly to the personage in supreme command\r\nof your ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is myself; switch him to me at once.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of less than fifteen seconds they had President\r\nPedrosan Pedro.\r\n\r\n\"We are prepared to resist, but we realize what this would cost in\r\nlives and destruction of property,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"You don't begin to. Do you know anything about nuclear weapons?\"\r\n\r\n\"From history; we have no nuclear power of any sort. We can find no\r\nfissionables on this planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cost, as you put it, would be everything and everybody in\r\nEglonsby and for a radius of almost a hundred miles. Are you still\r\nprepared to resist?\"\r\n\r\nThe President of the Council of Syndics wasn't and said so. Trask\r\nasked him how much authority his position gave him.\r\n\r\n\"I have all powers in any emergency. I think,\" the voice added\r\ntonelessly, \"that this is an emergency. The council will\r\nautomatically ratify any decision I make.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman depressed a button in front of him. \"What I said;\r\ndictatorship, with parliamentary false front.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he isn't a false-front dictator for some oligarchy.\" He motioned\r\nto Harkaman to take his thumb off the button. \"How large is this Council?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen, elected by the Syndicates they represent. There is the\r\nSyndicate of Labor, the Syndicate of Manufacturers, the Syndicate\r\nof Small Businesses, the....\"\r\n\r\n\"Corporate State, First Century Pre-Atomic on Terra. Benny the Moose,\"\r\nHarkaman said. \"Let's all go down and talk to them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen they were sure that the public had been warned to make no\r\nresistance, the _Nemesis_ went down to two miles, bulking over\r\nthe center of the city. The buildings were low by the standards of\r\na contragravity-using people, the highest barely a thousand feet\r\nand few over five hundred, and they were more closely set than\r\nSword-Worlders were accustomed to, with broad roadways between. In\r\nseveral places there were queer arrangements of crossed roadways,\r\napparently leading nowhere. Harkaman laughed when he saw them.\r\n\r\n\"Airstrips. I've seen them on other planets where they've lost\r\ncontragravity. For winged aircraft powered by chemical fuel. I hope\r\nwe have time for me to look around, here. I'll bet they even have\r\nrailroads here.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"great damage\" caused by the bomb was about equal to the effect\r\nof a medium hurricane; he had seen worse from high winds at Traskon.\r\nMostly it had been moral, which had been the kind intended.\r\n\r\nThey met President Pedrosan and the council of Syndics in a spacious\r\nand well-furnished chamber near the top of one of the medium-high\r\nbuildings. Valkanhayn was surprised; in a loud aside he considered\r\nthat these people must be almost civilized. They were introduced.\r\nAmaterasuan surnames preceded personal names, which hinted at a\r\nculture and a political organization making much use of registration\r\nby alphabetical list. They all wore garments which had the indefinable\r\nbut unmistakable appearance of uniforms. When they had all seated\r\nthemselves at a large oval table, Harkaman drew his pistol and used\r\nthe butt for a gavel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Lord Trask, will you deal with these people directly?\" he asked,\r\nstiffly formal.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Admiral.\" He spoke to the President, ignoring the\r\nothers. \"We want it understood that we control this city, and we\r\nexpect complete submission. As long as you remain submissive to us,\r\nwe will do no damage beyond removal of the things we wish to take\r\nfrom it, and there will be no violence to any of your people, or any\r\nindiscriminate vandalism. This visit we are paying you will cost you\r\nheavily, make no mistake about that, but whatever the cost, it will\r\nbe a cheap price for avoiding what we might otherwise do.\"\r\n\r\nThe President and the Syndics exchanged relieved glances. Let\r\nthe taxpayers worry about the cost; they'd come out of it with\r\nwhole skins.\r\n\r\n\"You understand, we want maximum value and minimum bulk,\" he\r\ncontinued. \"Jewels, objects of art, furs, the better grades of\r\nluxury goods of all kinds. Rare-element metals. And monetary metals,\r\ngold and platinum. You have a metallic-based currency, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" President Pedrosan was slightly scandalized. \"Our currency\r\nis based on services to society. Our monetary unit is simply called\r\na credit.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman snorted impolitely. Evidently he'd seen economic systems like\r\nthat before. Trask wanted to know if they used gold or platinum at all.\r\n\r\n\"Gold, to some extent, for jewelry.\" Evidently they weren't complete\r\neconomic puritans. \"And platinum in industry, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they want gold, they should have raided Stolgoland,\" one of the\r\nSyndics said. \"They have a gold-standard currency.\" From the way he\r\nsaid it, he might have been accusing them of eating with their\r\nfingers, and possibly of eating their own young.\r\n\r\n\"I know, the maps we're using for this planet are a few centuries old;\r\nStolgoland doesn't seem to appear on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it didn't appear on ours, either.\" That was General Dagró\r\nEctor, Syndic for State Protection.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been a good thing for this whole planet if you'd\r\ndecided to raid them instead of us,\" somebody else said.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't too late for these gentlemen to make that decision,\"\r\nPedrosan said. \"I gather that gold is a monetary metal among your\r\npeople?\" When Trask nodded, he continued: \"It is also the basis of\r\nthe Stolgonian currency. The actual currency is paper, theoretically\r\nredeemable in gold. In actuality, the circulation of gold has been\r\nprohibited, and the entire gold wealth of the nation is concentrated\r\nin vaults at three depositories. We know exactly where they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"You begin to interest me, President Pedrosan.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do? Well, you have two large spaceships and six smaller craft.\r\nYou have nuclear weapons, something nobody on this planet has. You\r\nhave contragravity, something that is hardly more than a legend\r\nhere. On the other hand, we have a million and a half ground-troops,\r\njet aircraft, armored ground-vehicles, and chemical weapons. If you\r\nwill undertake to attack Stolgoland, we will place this entire force\r\nat your disposal; General Dagró will command them as you direct. All\r\nthat we ask is that, when you have loaded the gold hoards of\r\nStolgoland aboard your ships, you will leave our troops in\r\npossession of the country.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was all there was to that meeting. There was a second one; only\r\nTrask, Harkaman and Sir Paytrik Morland represented the Space Vikings,\r\nand the Eglonsby government was represented by President Pedrosan\r\nand General Dagró. They met more intimately, in a smaller and more\r\nluxurious room in the same building.\r\n\r\n\"If you're going to declare war on Stolgoland, you'd better get\r\nalong with it,\" Morland advised.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Pedrosan seemed to have only the vaguest idea of what he was\r\ntalking about. \"You mean, warn them? Certainly not. We will attack\r\nthem by surprise. It will be nothing but plain self-defense,\" he\r\nadded righteously. \"The oligarchic capitalists of Stolgoland have\r\nbeen plotting to attack us for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. If you had carried out your original intention of looting\r\nEglonsby, they would have invaded us the moment your ships lifted\r\nout. It's exactly what I'd do in their place.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you maintain nominally friendly relations with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. We are civilized. The peace-loving government and people\r\nof Eglonsby....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. President; I understand. And they have an embassy here?\"\r\n\r\n\"They call it that!\" cried Dagró. \"It is a nest of vipers,\r\na plague-spot of espionage and subversion...!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll grab that ourselves, right away,\" Harkaman said. \"You won't be\r\nable to round up all their agents outside it, and if we tried to, it\r\nwould cause suspicion. We'll have to put up a front to deceive them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You will go on the air at once, calling on the people to\r\ncollaborate with us, and you will specifically order your troops\r\nmobilized to assist us in collecting the tribute we are levying on\r\nEglonsby,\" Trask said. \"In that way, if any Stolgonian spies see\r\nyour troops concentrated around our landing craft, they'll think\r\nit's to help us load our loot.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'll announce that a large part of the tribute will consist of\r\nmilitary equipment,\" Dagró added. \"That will explain why our guns\r\nand tanks are being loaded on your contragravity vehicles.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the Stolgonian embassy was seized by the Space Vikings, the\r\nambassador asked to be taken at once to their leader. He had a\r\nproposition: If the Space Vikings would completely disable the army\r\nof Eglonsby and admit Stolgonian troops when they were ready to\r\nleave, the invaders would bring with them ten thousand kilos of\r\ngold. Trask affected to be very hospitable to the offer.\r\n\r\nStolgoland lay across a narrow and shallow sea from the State of\r\nEglonsby; it was dotted with islands, and every one of them was, in\r\nturn, dotted with oil wells. Petroleum was what kept the aircraft\r\nand ground-vehicles of Amaterasu in operation; oil, rather than\r\nideology, was at the root of the enmity between the two nations.\r\nApparently the Stolgonian espionage in Eglonsby was completely\r\ndeceived, and the reports Trask allowed the captive ambassador to\r\nmake confirmed the deception. Hourly the Eglonsby radio stations\r\npoured out exhortations to the people to co-operate with the Space\r\nVikings, with an occasional lamentation about the masses of war\r\nmaterials being taken. Eglonsby espionage in Stolgoland was\r\nsimilarly active. The Stolgonian armies were being massed at four\r\nseaports on the coast facing Eglonsby, and there was a frantic\r\ngathering of every sort of ship available. By this time, any\r\nsympathy that Trask might have felt for either party had evaporated.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Stolgoland started the fifth morning after their\r\narrival over Eglonsby. Before dawn, the six pinnaces went in, making\r\na wide sweep around the curvature of the planet and coming in from\r\nthe north, two to each of the three gold-troves. They were detected\r\nby radar, eventually but too late for any effective resistance to\r\nbe organized. Two were even taken without a shot; by mid-morning all\r\nthree had been blown open and the ingots and specie were being removed.\r\n\r\nThe four seaports from whence the Stolgonian invasion of Eglonsby\r\nwas to have been launched were neutralized by nuclear bombing.\r\nNeutralized was a nice word, Trask thought; there was no echo in it\r\nof the screams of the still-living, maimed and burned and blinded,\r\naround the fringes of ground-zero. The _Nemesis_ and the _Space\r\nScourge_, from landing craft and from the ships themselves, landed\r\nEglonsby troops on Stolgonopolis. While they were sacking the city,\r\nwith all the usual atrocities, the Space Vikings were loading the\r\ngold, and anything else that was of more than ordinary value,\r\naboard the ships.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were still at it the next morning when President Pedrosan\r\narrived at the newly conquered capital, announcing his intention of\r\nputting the Stolgonian chief of state and his cabinet on trial as\r\nwar criminals. Before sunset, they were back over Eglonsby. The loot\r\nmight run as high as a half-billion Excalibur stellars. Boake\r\nValkanhayn and Garvan Spasso were simply beyond astonishment\r\nand beyond words.\r\n\r\nThe looting of Eglonsby then began.\r\n\r\nThey gathered up machinery, and stocks of steel and light-metal\r\nalloys. The city was full of warehouses, and the warehouses were\r\ncrammed with valuables. In spite of the socialistic and egalitarian\r\nverbiage behind which the government operated, there seemed to be a\r\nnumerous elite class and if gold were not a monetary metal it was\r\nnot despised for purposes of ostentation. There were several large\r\nart museums. Vann Larch, their nearest approach to an art\r\nspecialist, took charge of culling the best from them.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a vast public library. Into this Otto Harkaman\r\nvanished, with half a dozen men and a contragravity scow. Its\r\nhistorical section would be much poorer in the future.\r\n\r\nPresident Pedrosan Pedro was on the radio from Stolgonopolis that night.\r\n\r\n\"Is this how you Space Vikings keep faith?\" he demanded indignantly.\r\n\"You've abandoned me and my army here in Stolgoland, and you're\r\nsacking Eglonsby. You promised to leave Eglonsby alone if I helped\r\nyou get the gold of Stolgoland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised nothing of the kind. I promised to help you take\r\nStolgoland. You've taken it,\" Trask told him. \"I promised to avoid\r\nunnecessary damage or violence. I've already hanged a dozen of my\r\nown men for rape, murder and wanton vandalism. Now, we expect to be\r\nout of here in twenty-four hours. You'd better be back here before\r\nthen. Your own people are starting to loot. We did not promise to\r\ncontrol them for you.\"\r\n\r\nThat was true. What few troops had been left behind, and the police,\r\nwere unable to cope with the mobs that were pillaging in the wake of\r\nthe Space Vikings. Everybody seemed to be trying to grab what he\r\ncould and let the Vikings be blamed for it. He had been able to keep\r\nhis own people in order. There had been at least a dozen cases of\r\nrape and wanton murder, and the offenders had been promptly hanged.\r\nNone of their shipmates, not even the _Space Scourge_ company, seemed\r\nresentful. They felt the culprits had deserved what they'd gotten;\r\nnot for what they'd done to the locals, but for disobeying orders.\r\n\r\nA few troops had been flown in from Stolgoland by the time they had\r\ngotten their vehicles stowed and were lifting out. They didn't seem\r\nto be making much headway. Harkaman, who had gotten his load of\r\nmicrobooks stowed and was at the command desk, laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what Pedrosan'll do. Gehenna, I don't even know what\r\nI'd do, if I'd gotten myself into a mess like that. He'll probably\r\nbring half his army back, leave the other half in Stolgoland, and\r\nlose both. Suppose we drop in, in about three or four years, just\r\nout of curiosity. If we make twenty per cent of what we did this\r\ntime, the trip would pay for itself.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they went into hyperspace and had the ship secured, the\r\nparties lasted three Galactic standard days, and nobody was at all\r\nsober. Harkaman was drooling over the mass of historical material he\r\nhad found. Spasso was jubilant. Nobody could call this chicken-stealing.\r\nHe kept repeating that as long as he was able to say anything. Khepera,\r\nhe conceded, had been. Lousy two or three million stellars; poo!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBeowulf was bad.\r\n\r\nValkanhayn and Spasso had both been opposed to the raid. Nobody\r\nraided Beowulf; Beowulf was too tough. Beowulf had nuclear energy\r\nand nuclear weapons and contragravity and normal-space craft, they\r\neven had colonies on a couple of other planets of their system. They\r\nhad everything but hyperdrive. Beowulf was a civilized planet, and\r\nyou didn't raid civilized planets, not and get away with it.\r\n\r\nAnd beside, hadn't they gotten enough loot on Amaterasu?\r\n\r\n\"No, we did not,\" Trask told them. \"If we're going to make anything\r\nout of Tanith, we're going to need power, and I don't mean windmills\r\nand waterwheels. As you've remarked, Beowulf has nuclear energy.\r\nThat's where we get our plutonium and our power units.\"\r\n\r\nSo they went to Beowulf. They came out of hyperspace eight light-hours\r\nfrom the F-7 star of which Beowulf was the fourth planet, and twenty\r\nlight-minutes apart. Guatt Kirbey made a microjump that brought the\r\nships within practical communicating distance, and they began making\r\nplans in an intership screen conference.\r\n\r\n\"There are, or were, three chief sources of fissionable ores,\"\r\nHarkaman said. \"The last ship to raid here and get away was Stefan\r\nKintour's _Princess of Lyonesse_, sixty years ago. He hit one on the\r\nAntarctic continent; according to his account, everything there was\r\nfairly new. He didn't mess things up too badly, and it ought to be\r\nstill operating. We'll go in from the south pole, and we'll have to\r\ngo in fast.\"\r\n\r\nThey shifted personnel and equipment. They would go in bunched, the\r\npinnaces ahead; they and the _Space Scourge_ would go down to the\r\nground, while the better-armed _Nemesis_ would hover above to fight\r\noff local contragravity, shoot down missiles, and generally provide\r\noverhead cover. Trask transferred to the _Space Scourge_, taking\r\nwith him Morland and two hundred of the _Nemesis_ ground-fighters.\r\nMost of the single-mounts, landing craft and manipulators and\r\nheavy-duty lifters went with him, jamming the decks around the\r\nvehicle ports of Valkanhayn's ship.\r\n\r\nThey jumped in to six light-minutes, and while Valkanhayn's\r\nastrogator was still fiddling with his controls they began sensing\r\nradar and microray detection. When they came out again, they were\r\ntwo light-seconds off the south pole, and half a dozen ships were\r\neither in orbit or coming up from the planet. All normal-space\r\ncraft, of course, but some were almost as big as the _Nemesis_.\r\n\r\nFrom there on, it was a nightmare.\r\n\r\nShips pounded at them with guns, and they pounded back. Missiles\r\nwent out, and counter-missiles stopped them in rapidly expanding and\r\nquickly vanishing globes of light. Red lights flashed on the damage\r\nboard, and sirens howled and klaxons squawked. In the outside-view\r\nscreens, they saw the _Nemesis_ vanish in a blaze of radiance, and\r\nthen, while their hearts were still in their throats, come out of it\r\nagain. Red lights went off on the board as damage-control crews and\r\ntheir robots sealed the breaches in the hull and pumped air back\r\ninto evacuated areas, and then more red lights came on.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, he would glance toward Boake Valkanhayn, who sat\r\nmotionless in his chair, chewing a cigar that had gone out long ago.\r\nHe wasn't enjoying it, but he wasn't showing fear. Once a Beowulfer\r\nvanished in a supernova flash, and when the ball of incandescence\r\nwidened to nothing the ship was gone. All Valkanhayn said was: \"Hope\r\none of our boys did that.\"\r\n\r\nThey fought their way in and down, toward the atmosphere. Another\r\nBeowulf ship blew up, a craft about the size of Spasso's _Lamia_.\r\nA moment later, another; Valkanhayn was pounding the desk in front\r\nof him with his fist and yelling: \"That was one of ours! Find out\r\nwho launched it; get his name!\"\r\n\r\nMissiles were coming up from the planet, now. Valkanhayn's detection\r\nofficer was trying to locate the source. While he was trying, a big\r\nmelon-shaped thing fell away from the _Nemesis_, and in the jiggling,\r\nradiation-distorted intership screen Harkaman's image was laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Hellburner just went off; target about 50° south, 25° east of the\r\nsunrise line. That's where those missiles are coming from.\"\r\n\r\nCounter-missiles sped toward the big metal melon; defense missiles,\r\nrobot-launched, met them. The hellburner's track was marked first\r\nby expanding red and orange globes in airless space and then by\r\nfire-puffs after it entered atmosphere. It vanished into the darkness\r\nbeyond the sunset, and then made sunlight of its own. It _was_ sunlight;\r\na Bethe solar-phoenix reaction, and it would sustain itself for hours.\r\nHe hoped it hadn't landed within a thousand miles of their objective.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ground operation was a nightmare of a different sort. He went down\r\nin a command car, with Paytrik Morland and a couple of others. There\r\nwere missiles and gun batteries. There were darting patterns of flights\r\nof combat vehicles, blazing gunfire, and single vehicles that shot past\r\nor blew up in front of them. Robots on contragravity--military robots,\r\nwith missiles to launch, and working robots with only their own mass to\r\nhurl, flung themselves mindlessly at them. Screens that went crazy from\r\nradiation; speakers that jabbered contradictory orders. Finally, the\r\nbattle, which had raged in the air over two thousand square miles of\r\nmines and refineries and reaction plants, became two distinct and\r\nconcentrated battles, one at the packing plant and storage vaults and\r\none at the power-unit cartridge factory.\r\n\r\nThree pinnaces came down to form a triangle over each; the _Space\r\nScourge_ hung midway between, poured out a swarm of vehicles and big\r\nclaw-armed manipulators; armored lighters and landing craft shuttled\r\nback and forth. The command car looped and dodged from one target to the\r\nother; at one, keg-like canisters of plutonium, collapsium-plated and\r\nweighing tons apiece, were coming out of the vaults, and at the other\r\nlifters were bringing out loads of nuclear-electric power-unit\r\ncartridges, some as big as a ten liter jar, to power a spaceship engine,\r\nand some small as a round of pistol ammunition, for things like\r\nflashlights.\r\n\r\nEvery hour or so, he looked at his watch, and it would be three or\r\nfour minutes later.\r\n\r\nAt last, when he was completely convinced that he had really been\r\nkilled, and was damned and would spend all eternity in this\r\nfire-riven chaos, the _Nemesis_ began firing red flares and the\r\nspeakers in all the vehicles were signaling recall. He got aboard\r\nthe _Space Scourge_ somehow, after assuring himself that nobody who\r\nwas alive was left behind.\r\n\r\nThere were twenty-odd who weren't, and the sick bay was full of\r\nwounded who had gone up with cargo, and more were being helped off\r\nthe vehicles as they were berthed. The car in which he had been\r\nriding had been hit several times, and one of the gunners was\r\nbleeding under his helmet and didn't seem aware of it. When he got\r\nto the command room, he found Boake Valkanhayn, his face drawn and\r\nweary, getting coffee from a robot and lacing it with brandy.\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" he said, blowing on the steaming cup. It was the\r\nbattered silver one that had been in front of him when he had first\r\nappeared in the _Nemesis'_ screen. He nodded toward the damage\r\nscreen; everything had been patched up, or the outer decks around\r\nbreached portions of the hull sealed. \"Ship secure.\" He set down\r\nthe silver mug and lit a cigar. \"To quote Garvan Spasso, 'Nobody\r\ncan call that chicken-stealing.'\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Not even if you count Tizona giraffe-birds as chickens. That\r\nGram gum-pear brandy you're putting in that coffee? I'll have the\r\nsame. Just leave out the coffee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Lamia_'s detection picked them up as soon as they were out of\r\nthe last microjump; Trask's gnawing fear that Dunnan might attack in\r\ntheir absence had been groundless. Incredibly, he realized, they had\r\nbeen gone only thirty-odd Galactic Standard days, and in that time\r\nAlvyn Karffard had done an incredible amount of work.\r\n\r\nHe had gotten the spaceport completely cleared of rubble and debris,\r\nand he had the woods cleared away from around it and the two tall\r\nbuildings. The locals called the city Rivvin; a few inscriptions\r\nfound here and there in it indicated that the original name had been\r\nRivington. He had done considerable mapping, in some detail of the\r\ncontinent on which it was located and, in general, of the rest of\r\nthe planet. And he had established friendly relations with the\r\npeople of Tradetown and made friends with their king.\r\n\r\nNobody, not even those who had collected it, quite believed their\r\neyes when the loot was unloaded. The little herd of long haired\r\nunicorns--the Khepera locals had called them kreggs, probably a\r\ncorruption of the name of some naturalist who had first studied\r\nthem--had come through the voyage and even the Battle of Beowulf\r\nin good shape. Trask and a few of his former cattlemen from Traskon\r\nwatched them anxiously, and the ship's doctor, acting veterinarian,\r\nmade elaborate tests of vegetation they would be likely to eat.\r\nThree of the cows proved to be with calf; these were isolated and\r\nwatched over with especial solicitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe locals were inclined to take a poor view of the kreggs, at\r\nfirst. Cattle ought to have two horns, one on either side, curved\r\nback. It wasn't right for cattle to have only one horn, in the\r\nmiddle, slanting forward.\r\n\r\nBoth ships had taken heavy damage. The _Nemesis_ had one pinnace\r\nberth knocked open, and everybody was glad the Beowulfers hadn't\r\nnoticed that and gotten a missile inside. The _Space Scourge_ had\r\ntaken a hit directly on her south pole while lifting out from the\r\nplanet, and a good deal of the southern part of the ship was sealed\r\noff when she came in. The _Nemesis_ was repaired as far as possible\r\nand put on off-planet patrol, then they went to work on the _Space\r\nScourge_, transferring much of her armament to ground defense,\r\nclearing out all the available cargo space, and repairing her hull\r\nas far as possible. To repair her completely was a job for a regular\r\nshipyard, like Alex Gorram's on Gram. And that was where the work\r\nwould be done.\r\n\r\nBoake Valkanhayn would command her on the voyage to and from Gram.\r\nSince Beowulf, Trask had not only ceased to dislike the man, but was\r\nbeginning to admire him. He had been a good man once, before ill\r\nfortune which had been only partly of his own making had overtaken\r\nhim. He'd just let himself go and stopped caring. Now he had taken\r\nhold of himself again. It had started showing after they had landed\r\non Amaterasu. He had begun to dress more neatly and speak more\r\ngrammatically; to look and act more like a spaceman and less like a\r\nbarfly. His men had begun to jump to obey when he gave an order. He\r\nhad opposed the raid on Beowulf, but that had been the dying\r\nstruggle of the chicken-thief he had been. He had been scared, going\r\nin; well, who hadn't been, except a few greenhorns brave with the\r\nvalor of ignorance. But he had gone in, and fought his ship well,\r\nand had held his station over the fissionables plant in a hell of\r\nbombs and missile, and he had made sure everybody who had gone down\r\nand who was still alive was aboard before he lifted out.\r\n\r\nHe was a Space Viking again.\r\n\r\nGarvan Spasso wasn't, and never would be. He was outraged when he\r\nheard that Valkanhayn would take his ship, loaded with much of the\r\nloot of the three planets, to Gram. He came to Trask, fairly\r\nspluttering about it.\r\n\r\n\"You know what'll happen?\" he demanded. \"He'll space out with that\r\ncargo, and that'll be the last any of us'll hear of him again. He'll\r\nprobably take it to Joyeuse or Excalibur and buy himself a lordship\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I doubt that, Garvan. A number of our people are going\r\nalong--Guatt Kirbey will be the astrogator; you'd trust him,\r\nwouldn't you? And Sir Paytrik Morland, and Baron Rathmore, and\r\nLord Valpry, and Rolve Hemmerding....\" He was silent for a moment,\r\nstruck by an idea. \"Would you be willing to make the trip in the\r\n_Space Scourge_, too?\"\r\n\r\nSpasso would, very decidedly. Trask nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Good. Then we'll be sure nothing crooked is pulled,\" he said\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\nAfter Spasso was gone, he got in touch with Baron Rathmore.\r\n\r\n\"See to it that he gets as much money that's due him as possible,\r\nwhen you get to Gram. And ask Duke Angus, as a favor to give him\r\nsome meaningless position with a suitably impressive title, Lord\r\nChamberlain of the Ducal Washroom, or something. Then he can prime\r\nhim with misinformation and give him an opportunity to sell it to\r\nOmfray of Glaspyth. Then, of course, he could be contacted to sell\r\nOmfray out to Angus. A couple of times around and somebody'll stick\r\na knife in him, and then we'll be rid of him for good.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey loaded the _Space Scourge_ with gold from Stolgoland, and\r\npaintings and statues from the art museums and fabrics and furs and\r\njewels and porcelains and plate from the markets of Eglonsby. They\r\nloaded sacks and kegs of specie from Khepera. Most of the Khepera\r\nloot wasn't worth hauling to Gram, but it was far enough in advance\r\nof their own technologies to be priceless to the Tanith locals.\r\n\r\nSome of these were learning simple machine operations, and a few\r\nwere able to handle contragravity vehicles that had been fitted with\r\nadequate safety devices. The former slave guards had all become\r\nsergeants and lieutenants in an infantry regiment that had been\r\nformed, and the King of Tradetown borrowed some to train his own\r\narmy. Some genius in the machine shop altered a matchlock musket\r\nto flintlock and showed the local gunsmiths how to do it.\r\n\r\nThe kreggs continued to thrive, after the _Space Scourge_ departed.\r\nSeveral calves were born, and seemed to be doing well; the biochemistry\r\nof Tanith and Khepera were safely alike. Trask had hopes for them.\r\nEvery Viking ship had its own carniculture vats, but men tired of\r\ncarniculture meat, and fresh meat was always in demand. Some day,\r\nhe hoped, kregg-beef would be an item of sale to ships putting in\r\non Tanith, and the long-haired hides might even find a market in\r\nthe Sword-Worlds. They had contragravity scows plying between\r\nRivington and Tradetown regularly, now, and air-lorries were linking\r\nthe villages. The boatmen of Tradetown rioted occasionally against\r\nthis unfair competition. And in Rivington itself, bulldozers and\r\npower shovels and manipulators labored, and there was always a\r\nrising cloud of dust over the city.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to do, and only a trifle under twenty-five\r\nGalactic Standard hours in a day to do it. There were whole days\r\nin which he never thought once of Andray Dunnan.\r\n\r\nA hundred and twenty-five days to Gram, and a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five days back. They had long ago passed. Of course, there\r\nwould be the work of repairing the _Space Scourge_, the conferences\r\nwith the investors in the original Tanith Adventure, the business\r\nof gathering the needed equipment for the new base. Even so, he was\r\nbeginning to worry a little. Worry about something as far out of his\r\ncontrol as the _Space Scourge_ was useless, he knew. He couldn't\r\nhelp it, though. Even Harkaman, usually imperturbable, began to be\r\nfretful, after two hundred and seventy days had passed.\r\n\r\nThey were relaxing in the living quarters they had fitted out at the\r\ntop of the spaceport building before retiring, both sprawled wearily\r\nin chairs that had come from one of the better hotels of Eglonsby,\r\ntheir drinks between them on a low table, the top of which was\r\ninlaid with something that looked like ivory but wasn't. On the\r\nfloor beside it lay the plans for a reaction-plant and mass-energy\r\nconverter they would build as soon as the _Space Scourge_ returned\r\nwith equipment for producing collapsium-plated shielding.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we could go ahead with it, now,\" Harkaman said.\r\n\"We could tear enough armor off the _Lamia_ to shield any kind\r\nof a reaction plant.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the first time either of them had gotten close to the\r\npossibility that the ship mightn't return. Trask laid his cigar in\r\nthe ashtray--it had come from President Pedrosan Pedro's private\r\noffice--and splashed a little more brandy into his glass.\r\n\r\n\"She'll be coming before long. We have enough of our people aboard\r\nto make sure nobody else tries to take the ship. And I really\r\nbelieve, now, that Valkanhayn can be trusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, too. I'm not worried about what might happen on the ship.\r\nBut we don't know what's been happening on Gram. Glaspyth and\r\nDidreksburg could have teamed up and jumped Wardshaven before\r\nDuke Angus was ready to invade Glaspyth. Boake might be landing\r\nthe ship in a trap at Wardshaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be a sorry looking trap after it closed on him. That would be the\r\nfirst time in history that a Sword-World was raided by Space Vikings.\"\r\nHarkaman looked at his half-empty glass, then filled it to the top.\r\nIt was the same drink he had started with, just as a regiment that\r\nhas been decimated and recruited up to strength a few times is still\r\nthe same regiment.\r\n\r\nThe buzz of the communication screen--one of the few things in the\r\nroom that hadn't been looted somewhere--interrupted him. They both\r\nrose; Harkaman, still carrying his drink, went to put it on. It was\r\na man on duty in the control room, overhead, reporting that two\r\nemergences had just been detected at twenty light-minutes due north\r\nof the planet. Harkaman gulped his drink and set down the empty glass.\r\n\r\n\"All right. You put out a general alert? Switch anything that comes\r\nin over to this screen.\" He got out his pipe and was packing tobacco\r\ninto it mechanically. \"They'll be out of the last microjump and\r\nabout two light-seconds away in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nTrask sat down again, saw that his cigarette had burned almost to\r\nthe tip, and lit a fresh one from it, wishing he could be as calm\r\nabout it as Harkaman. Three minutes later, the control tower picked\r\nup two emergences at a light-second and a half, a thousand or so\r\nmiles apart. Then the screen flickered, and Boake Valkanhayn was\r\nlooking out of it, from the desk in the newly refurbished command\r\nroom of the _Space Scourge_.\r\n\r\nHe was a newly refurbished Boake Valkanhayn, too. His heavily\r\nbraided captain's jacket looked like the work of one of the better\r\ntailors on Gram, and on the breast was a large and ornate knight's\r\nstar, of unfamiliar design, bearing, among other things, the sword\r\nand atom-symbol of the house of Ward.\r\n\r\n\"Prince Trask; Count Harkaman,\" he greeted. \"_Space Scourge_, Tanith;\r\nthirty-two hundred hours out of Wardshaven on Gram, Baron Valkanhayn\r\ncommanding, accompanied by chartered freighter _Rozinante_, Durendal,\r\nCaptain Morbes. Requesting permission and instructions to orbit in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Baron Valkanhayn?\" Harkaman asked.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Valkanhayn grinned. \"And I have a vellum scroll the\r\nsize of a blanket to prove it. I have a whole cargo of scrolls. One\r\nsays you're Otto, Count Harkaman, and another says you're Admiral of\r\nthe Royal Navy of Gram.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did it!\" Trask cried. \"He made himself King of Gram!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. And you're his trusty and well-loved Lucas, Prince\r\nTrask, and Viceroy of his Majesty's Realm of Tanith.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman bristled at that. \"The Gehenna you say. This is _our_ Realm\r\nof Tanith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is his Majesty making it worth while to accept his sovereignty?\"\r\nTrask asked. \"That is, beside vellum scrolls?\"\r\n\r\nValkanhayn was still grinning. \"Wait till we start sending cargo\r\ndown. And wait till you see what's crammed into the other ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Spasso come back with you?\" Harkaman asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. Sir Garvan Spasso entered the service of his Majesty, King\r\nAngus. He is Chief of Police at Glaspyth, now, and nobody can call\r\nwhat he's doing there chicken-stealing, either. Any chickens he\r\nsteals, he steals the whole farm to get them.\"\r\n\r\nThat didn't sound good. Spasso could make King Angus' name stink all\r\nover Glaspyth. Or maybe he'd allow Spasso to crush the adherents of\r\nOmfray, and then hang him for his oppression of the people. He'd\r\nread about somebody who'd done something like that, in one of\r\nHarkaman's Old Terran history books.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBaron Rathmore had stayed on Gram; so had Rolve Hemmerding. The\r\nrest of the gentlemen-adventurers, all with shiny new titles of\r\nnobility, had returned. From them, as the two ships were getting\r\ninto orbit, he learned what had happened on Gram since the _Nemesis_\r\nhad spaced out.\r\n\r\nDuke Angus had announced his intention of carrying on with the\r\nTanith Adventure, and had started construction of a new ship at\r\nthe Gorram yards. This had served plausibly to explain all the\r\nactivities of preparation for the invasion of Glaspyth, and had\r\ndeceived Duke Omfray completely. Omfray had already started a ship\r\nof his own; the entire resources of his duchy were thrown into an\r\neffort to get her finished and to space ahead of the one Angus was\r\nbuilding. Work was going on frantically on her when the Wardshaven\r\ninvaders hit Glaspyth; she was now nearing completion as a unit of\r\nthe Royal Navy. Duke Omfray had managed to escape to Didreksburg;\r\nwhen Angus' troops moved in on the latter duchy, he had escaped\r\nagain, this time off-planet. He was now eating the bitter bread of\r\nexile at the court of his wife's uncle, the King of Haulteclere.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Newhaven, the Duke of Bigglersport, and the Lord of\r\nNorthport, all of whom had favored the establishment of a planetary\r\nmonarchy, had immediately acknowledged Angus as their sovereign. So,\r\nwith a knife at his throat, had the Duke of Didreksburg. Many other\r\nfeudal magnates had refused to surrender their sovereignty. That\r\nmight mean fighting, but Paytrik, now Baron, Morland, doubted it.\r\n\r\n\"The _Space Scourge_ stopped that,\" he said. \"When they heard about\r\nthe base here, and saw what we'd shipped to Gram, they started\r\nchanging their minds. Only subjects of King Angus will be allowed\r\nto invest in the Tanith Adventure.\"\r\n\r\nAs for accepting King Angus' annexation of Tanith and accepting his\r\nsovereignty, that would also be advisable. They would need a Sword\r\nWorld outlet for the loot they took or obtained by barter from other\r\nSpace Vikings, and until they had adequate industries of their own,\r\nthey would be dependent on Gram for many things which could not be\r\ngotten by raiding.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the King knows I'm not out here for my health, or\r\nhis profit?\" he asked Lord Valpry, during one of the screen\r\nconversations as the _Space Scourge_ was getting into orbit.\r\n\"My business out here is Andray Dunnan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" the Wardshaven noble replied. \"In fact, he told me, in so\r\nmany words, that he would be most happy if you sent him his nephew's\r\nhead in a block of lucite. What Dunnan did touched his honor, too.\r\nSovereign princes never see any humor in things like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he knows that sooner or later Dunnan will try to attack\r\nTanith?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he doesn't, it isn't because I didn't tell him often enough. When\r\nyou see the defense armament we're bringing, you'll think he does.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impressive, but nothing to the engineering and industrial\r\nequipment. Mining robots for use on the iron Moon of Tanith, and\r\nnormal-space transports for the fifty thousand mile run between\r\nplanet and satellite. A collapsed-matter producer; now they could\r\ncollapsium-plate their own shielding. A small, fully robotic, steel\r\nmill that could be set up and operated on the satellite. Industrial\r\nrobots, and machinery to make machinery. And, best of all, two\r\nhundred engineers and highly skilled technicians.\r\n\r\nQuite a few industrial baronies on Gram would realize, before long,\r\nwhat they had lost in those men. He wondered what Lord Trask of\r\nTraskon would have thought about that.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Tanith was no longer interested in what happened to\r\nGram. Maybe, if things prospered for the next century or so, his\r\nsuccessors would be ruling Gram by viceroy from Tanith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the _Space Scourge_ was unloaded, she was put on\r\noff-planet watch; Harkaman immediately spaced out in the _Nemesis_,\r\nwhile Trask remained behind. They began unloading the _Rozinante_,\r\nafter setting her down at Rivington Spaceport. After that was done,\r\nher officers and crew took a holiday which lasted a month, until the\r\n_Nemesis_ returned. Harkaman must have made quick raids on half a\r\ndozen planets. None of the cargo he brought back was spectacularly\r\nvaluable, and he dismissed the whole thing as chicken-stealing, but\r\nhe had lost some men and the ship showed a few fresh scars. A good\r\ndeal of what was transshipped to the _Rozinante_ was manufactured\r\ngoods which would compete with merchandise produced on Gram.\r\n\r\n\"That load will be a come-down, after what the _Space Scourge_ took\r\nback, but we didn't want to send the _Rozinante_ back empty,\" he\r\nsaid. \"One thing, I had time to do a little reading, between stops.\"\r\n\r\n\"The books from the Eglonsby library?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I learned a curious thing about Amaterasu. Do you know why that\r\nplanet was so extensively colonized by the Federation, when there\r\ndon't seem to be any fissionable ores? The planet produced gadolinium.\"\r\n\r\nGadolinium was essential to hyperdrive engines; the engines of a\r\nship the size of the _Nemesis_ required fifty pounds of it. On the\r\nSword-Worlds, it was worth several times its weight in gold. If they\r\nstill mined it, Amaterasu would repay a second visit.\r\n\r\nWhen he mentioned it, Harkaman shrugged. \"Why should they mine it?\r\nThere's only one thing it's good for, and you can't run a spaceship\r\non Diesel oil. I suppose the mines could be reopened, and new\r\nrefineries built, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"We could trade plutonium for gadolinium. They have none of their\r\nown. We could charge our own prices for it, and we wouldn't need to\r\ntell them what gadolinium sells for on the Sword-Worlds.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could, if we could do business with anybody there, after what\r\nwe did to Eglonsby and Stolgoland. Where would we get plutonium?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you think the Beowulfers don't have hyperships, when they\r\nhave everything else?\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman snapped his fingers. \"By Satan, that's it!\" Then he looked\r\nat Trask in alarm. \"Hey, you're not thinking of selling Amaterasu\r\nplutonium and Beowulf gadolinium, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? We could make a big profit on both ends of the deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what would happen next, don't you? There'd be ships from\r\nboth planets all over the place in a few years. We want that like\r\nwe want a hole in the head.\"\r\n\r\nHe couldn't see the objection. Tanith and Amaterasu and Beowulf\r\ncould work up a very good triangular trade; all three would profit.\r\nIt wouldn't cost men and ship-damage and ammunition, either. Maybe\r\na mutual defense alliance, too. Think about it later; there was too\r\nmuch to do here on Tanith at present.\r\n\r\nThere had been mines on the Moon of Tanith before the collapse of\r\nthe Federation; they had been stripped of their equipment afterward,\r\nwhile Tanith was still fighting a rearguard battle against barbarism,\r\nbut the underground chambers and man-made caverns could still be used,\r\nand in time the mines were reopened and the steel mill put in, and\r\neventually ingots of finished steel were coming down by shuttle-craft.\r\nIn the meantime, the shipyard had been laid out and was taking shape.\r\n\r\nThe Gram ship _Queen Flavia_--she had been the one found unfinished\r\nat Glaspyth--came in three months after the _Rozinante_ started\r\nback; she must have been finished while Valkanhayn was still in\r\nhyperspace. She carried considerable cargo, some of it superfluous\r\nbut all of it useful; everybody was investing in the Tanith Adventure\r\nnow, and the money had to be spent for something. Better, she brought\r\nclose to a thousand men and women; the leakage of brains and ability\r\nfrom the Sword-Worlds was turning into a flood. Among them was Basil\r\nGorram. Trask remembered him as an insufferable young twerp, but he\r\nseemed to be a good shipyard man. He very frankly predicted that\r\nin a few years his father's yards at Wardshaven would be idle and\r\nall the Tanith ships would be Tanith-built. A junior partner of\r\nLothar Ffayle's also came out, to establish a branch of the Bank of\r\nWardshaven at Rivington.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the _Queen Flavia_ had discharged her cargo and\r\npassengers, she took on five hundred ground-fighters from the\r\n_Lamia_, _Nemesis_ and _Space Scourge_ companies and spaced out on\r\na raiding voyage. While she was gone, the second ship, the one Duke\r\nAngus had started at Wardshaven and King Angus had finished, the\r\n_Black Star_, came in.\r\n\r\nTrask was slightly incredulous at realizing that she had spaced out\r\nfrom Gram almost exactly two years after the _Nemesis_ had departed.\r\nHe still hadn't any idea where Andray Dunnan was, or what he was\r\ndoing, or how to find him.\r\n\r\nThe news of the Gram base on Tanith spread slowly, first by the\r\nscheduled liners and tramp freighters that linked the Sword-Worlds,\r\nand then by trading ships and outbound Space Vikings to the Old\r\nFederation. Two years and six months after the _Nemesis_ had come\r\nout of hyperspace to find Boake Valkanhayn and Garvan Spasso on\r\nTanith, the first independent Space Viking came in, to sell a cargo\r\nand get repairs. They bought his loot--he had been raiding some\r\nplanet rather above the level of Khepera and below that of\r\nAmaterasu--and healed the wounds his ship had taken getting it. He\r\nhad been dealing with the Everrard family on Hoth, and professed\r\nhimself much more satisfied with the bargains he had gotten on\r\nTanith and swore to return.\r\n\r\nHe had never even heard of Andray Dunnan or the _Enterprise_.\r\n\r\nIt was a Gilgamesher that brought the first news.\r\n\r\nHe had first heard of Gilgameshers--the word was used\r\nindiscriminately for a native of or a ship from Gilgamesh--on Gram,\r\nfrom Harkaman and Karffard and Vann Larch and the others. Since\r\ncoming to Tanith, he had heard about them from every Space Viking,\r\nnever in complimentary and rarely in printable terms.\r\n\r\nGilgamesh was rated, with reservations, as a civilized planet though\r\nnot on a level with Odin or Isis or Baldur or Marduk or Aton or any\r\nof the other worlds which had maintained the culture of the Terran\r\nFederation uninterruptedly. Perhaps Gilgamesh deserved more credit;\r\nits people had undergone two centuries of darkness and pulled\r\nthemselves out of it by their bootstraps. They had recovered all\r\nthe old techniques, up to and including the hyperdrive.\r\n\r\nThey didn't raid; they traded. They had religious objections to\r\nviolence, though they kept these within sensible limits, and were\r\nable and willing to fight with fanatical ferocity in defense of\r\ntheir home planet. About a century before, there had been a\r\nfive-ship Viking raid on Gilgamesh; one ship had returned and had\r\nbeen sold for scrap after reaching a friendly base. Their ships went\r\neverywhere to trade, and wherever they traded a few of them usually\r\nsettled, and where they settled they made money, sending most of it\r\nhome. Their society seemed to be a loose theo-socialism, and their\r\nreligion an absurd potpourri of most of the major monotheisms of the\r\nFederation period, plus doctrinal and ritualistic innovations of\r\ntheir own. Aside from their propensity for sharp trading, their\r\nbigoted refusal to regard anybody not of their creed as more than\r\nhalf human, and the maze of dietary and other taboos in which they\r\nhid from social contact with others, made them generally disliked.\r\n\r\nAfter their ship had gotten into orbit, three of them came down to\r\ndo business. The captain and his exec wore long coats, almost\r\nknee-length, buttoned to the throat, and small white caps like\r\nforage caps; the third, one of their priests, wore a robe with a\r\ncowl, and the symbol of their religion, a blue triangle in a white\r\ncircle, on his breast. They all wore beards that hung down from\r\ntheir cheeks, with their chins and upper lips shaved. They all had\r\nthe same righteous, disapproving faces, they all refused\r\nrefreshments of any sort, and they sat uneasily as though fearing\r\ncontamination from the heathens who had sat in their chairs before\r\nthem. They had a mixed cargo of general merchandise picked up here\r\nand there on subcivilized planets, in which nobody on Tanith was\r\ninterested. They also had some good stuff--vegetable-amber and\r\nflame-bird plumes from Irminsul; ivory or something very like it\r\nfrom somewhere else; diamonds and Uller organic opals and\r\nZarathustra sunstones. They also had some platinum. They wanted\r\nmachinery, especially contragravity engines and robots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe trouble was, they wanted to haggle. Haggling, it seemed, was\r\nthe Gilgamesh planetary sport.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard of a Space Viking ship named the _Enterprise_?\"\r\nhe asked them, at the seventh or eighth impasse in the bargaining.\r\n\"She bears a crescent, light blue on black. Her captain's name is\r\nAndray Dunnan.\"\r\n\r\n\"A ship so named, with such a device, raided Chermosh more than a\r\nyear ago,\" the priest-supercargo said. \"Some of our people tarry on\r\nChermosh to trade. This ship sacked the city in which they were;\r\nsome of them lost heavily in world's goods.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a pity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gilgamesh priest shrugged. \"It is as Yah the Almighty wills,\"\r\nhe said, then brightened slightly. \"The Chermoshers are heathens\r\nand worshipers of false gods. The Space Vikings looted their temple\r\nand destroyed it utterly; they carried away the graven images and\r\nabominations. Our people bore witness that there was much wailing\r\nand lamentation among the idolators.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo that was the first entry on the Big Board. It covered,\r\noptimistically, the whole of one wall in his office, and for some\r\ntime that one chalked note about the raid on Chermosh, and the date,\r\nas nearly as it could be approximated, looked very lonely on it. The\r\ncaptain of the _Black Star_ brought back material for a couple more.\r\nHe had put in on several planets known to be temporarily occupied by\r\nSpace Vikings, to barter loot, give his men some time off-ship, and\r\nmake inquiries, and he had names for a couple of planets raided by\r\nthe blue crescent ship. One was only six months old.\r\n\r\nThe way news filtered about in the Old Federation, that was\r\npractically hot off the stove.\r\n\r\nThe owner-captain of the _Alborak_ had something to add, when he\r\nbrought his ship in six months later. He sipped his drink slowly,\r\nas though he had limited himself to one and wanted to make it last\r\nas long as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Almost two years ago, on Jagannath,\" he said. \"The _Enterprise_ was\r\non orbit there, getting some light repairs. I met the man a few\r\ntimes. Looks just like those pictures, but he's wearing a small\r\npointed beard, now. He'd sold a lot of loot. General merchandise,\r\nprecious and semiprecious stones, a lot of carved and inlaid\r\nfurniture that looked as though it had come from some Neobarb king's\r\npalace, and some temple stuff. Buddhist; there were a couple of big\r\ngold Dai-Butsus. His crew were standing drinks for all comers. Some\r\nof them were pretty dark above the collar, as though they'd been on\r\na hot-star planet not too long before. And he had a lot of Imhotep\r\nfurs to sell, simply fabulous stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of repairs? Combat damage?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was my impression. He spaced out a little over a hundred hours\r\nafter I came in, in company with another ship. The _Starhopper_,\r\nCaptain Teodor Vaghn. The talk was that they were making a two-ship\r\nraid somewhere.\" The captain of the _Alborak_ thought for a moment.\r\n\"One other thing. He was buying ammunition, everything from pistol\r\ncartridges to hellburners. And he was buying all the air-and-water\r\nrecycling equipment, and all the carniculture and hydroponic\r\nequipment, he could get.\"\r\n\r\nThat was something to know. He thanked the Space Viking, and then asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did he know, at the time, that I'm out here hunting for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he did, nobody else on Jagannath did. I didn't hear about it,\r\nmyself, till six months afterward.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening, he played off the recording he had made of the\r\nconversation for Harkaman and Valkanhayn and Karffard and some\r\nof the others. Somebody instantly said:\r\n\r\n\"That temple stuff came from Chermosh. They're Buddhists, there.\r\nThat checks with the Gilgamesher's story.\"\r\n\r\n\"He got the furs on Imhotep; he traded for them,\" Harkaman said.\r\n\"Nobody gets anything off Imhotep by raiding. The planet's in the\r\nmiddle of a glaciation, the land surface down to the fiftieth\r\nparallel is iced over solid. There is one city, ten or fifteen\r\nthousand, and the rest of the population is scattered around in\r\nsettlements of a couple of hundred all along the face of the\r\nglaciers. They're all hunters and trappers. They have some\r\ncontragravity, and when a ship comes in, they spread the news by\r\nradio and everybody brings his furs to town. They use telescope\r\nsights, and everybody over ten years old can hit a man in the head\r\nat five hundred yards. And big weapons are no good; they're too well\r\ndispersed. So the only way to get anything out of them is to trade\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I know where he was,\" Alvyn Karffard said. \"On Imhotep,\r\nsilver is a monetary metal. On Agni, they use silver for sewer-pipe.\r\nAgni is a hot-star planet, class B-3 sun. And on Agni they are\r\ntough, and they have good weapons. That could be where the\r\n_Enterprise_ took that combat damage.\"\r\n\r\nThat started an argument as to whether he'd gone to Chermosh first.\r\nIt was sure that he had gone to Agni and then Imhotep. Guatt Kirbey\r\ntried to figure both courses.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't tell us anything, either way,\" he said at length. \"Chermosh\r\nis away off to the side from Agni and Imhotep in either case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he does have a base, somewhere, and it's not on any\r\nTerra-type planet,\" Valkanhayn said. \"Otherwise, what would he want\r\nwith all that air-and-water and hydroponic and carniculture stuff?\"\r\n\r\nThe Old Federation area was full of non-Terra-type planets, and why\r\nshould anybody bother going to any of them? Any planet that wasn't\r\noxygen-atmosphere, six to eight thousand miles in diameter, and\r\nwithin a narrow surface-temperature range, wasn't worth wasting time\r\non. But a planet like that, if one had the survival equipment, would\r\nmake a wonderful hideout.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a captain is this Teodor Vaghn?\" he asked. \"A good\r\none,\" Harkaman said promptly. \"He has a nasty streak--sadistic--but\r\nhe knows his business and he has a good ship and a well-trained\r\ncrew. You think he and Dunnan have teamed up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you? I think, now that he has a base, Dunnan is getting\r\na fleet together.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll know we're after him by now,\" Vann Larch said. \"And he knows\r\nwhere we are, and that puts him one up on us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Andray Dunnan was haunting him again. Tiny bits of information\r\ncame in--Dunnan's ship had been on Hoth, on Nergal, selling loot.\r\nNow he sold for gold or platinum, and bought little, usually arms\r\nand ammunition. Apparently his base, wherever it was, was fully\r\nself-sufficient. It was certain, too, that Dunnan knew he was being\r\nhunted. One Space Viking who had talked with him quoted him as\r\nsaying: \"I don't want any trouble with Trask, and if he's smart he\r\nwon't look for any with me.\" This made him all the more positive\r\nthat somewhere Dunnan was building strength for an attack on Tanith.\r\nHe made it a rule that there should always be at least two ships in\r\norbit off Tanith in addition to the _Lamia_, which was on permanent\r\npatrol, and he installed more missile-launching stations both on the\r\nmoon and on the planet.\r\n\r\nThere were three ships bearing the Ward swords and atom-symbol, and\r\na fourth building on Gram. Count Lionel of Newhaven was building\r\none of his own, and three big freighters shuttled across the three\r\nthousand light-years between Tanith and Gram. Sesar Karvall, who had\r\nnever recovered from his wounds, had died; Lady Lavina had turned\r\nthe barony and the business over to her brother, Burt Sandrasan,\r\nand gone to live on Excalibur. The shipyard at Rivington was\r\nfinished, and now they had built the landing-legs of Harkaman's\r\n_Corisande II_, and were putting up the skeleton.\r\n\r\nAnd they were trading with Amaterasu, now. Pedrosan Pedro had been\r\noverthrown and put to death by General Dagró Ector during the\r\ndisorders following the looting of Eglonsby; the troops left behind\r\nin Stolgoland had mutinied and made common cause with their late\r\nenemies. The two nations were in an uneasy alliance, with several\r\nother nations combining against them, when the _Nemesis_ and the\r\n_Space Scourge_ returned and declared peace against the whole\r\nplanet. There was no fighting; everybody knew what had happened to\r\nStolgoland and Eglonsby. In the end, all the governments of Amaterasu\r\njoined in a loose agreement to get the mines reopened and resume\r\nproduction of gadolinium, and to share in the fissionables\r\nbeing imported in exchange.\r\n\r\nIt had been harder, and had taken a year longer, to do business with\r\nBeowulf. The Beowulfers had a single planetary government, and they\r\nwere inclined to shoot first and negotiate afterward, a natural\r\nenough attitude in view of experiences of the past. However, they\r\nhad enough old Federation-period textbooks still in microprint to\r\nknow what could be done with gadolinium. They decided to write off\r\nthe past as fair fight and no bad blood, and start over again.\r\n\r\nIt would be some years before either planet had hyperships of their\r\nown. In the meantime, both were good customers, and rapidly becoming\r\ngood friends. A number of young Amaterasuans and Beowulfers had come\r\nto Tanith to study various technologies.\r\n\r\nThe Tanith locals were studying, too. In the first year, Trask\r\nhad gathered the more intelligent boys of ten to twelve from each\r\ncommunity and begun teaching them. In the past year, he had sent\r\nthe most intelligent of them off to Gram to school. In another\r\nfive years, they'd be coming home to teach; in the meantime, he\r\nwas bringing teachers to Tanith from Gram. There was a school\r\nat Tradetown, and others in some of the larger villages, and\r\nat Rivington there was something that could almost be called a\r\ncollege. In another ten years or so, Tanith would be able to\r\npretend to the status of civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf only Andray Dunnan and his ships didn't come too soon. They would\r\nbe beaten off, he was confident of that; but the damage Tanith would\r\ntake, in the defense, would set back his work for years. He knew all\r\ntoo well what Space Viking ships could do to a planet. He'd have to\r\nfind Dunnan's base, smash it, destroy his ships, kill the man\r\nhimself, first. Not to avenge that murder six years ago on Gram;\r\nthat was long ago and far away, and Elaine was vanished, and so was\r\nthe Lucas Trask who had loved and lost her. What mattered now was\r\nplanting and nurturing civilization on Tanith.\r\n\r\nBut where would he find Dunnan, in two hundred billion cubic\r\nlight-years? Dunnan had no such problem. He knew where his enemy was.\r\n\r\nAnd Dunnan was gathering strength. The _Yo-Yo_, Captain Vann\r\nHumfort; she had been reported twice, once in company with the\r\n_Starhopper_, and once with the _Enterprise_. She bore a blazon of\r\na feminine hand dangling a planet by a string from one finger; a\r\ngood ship, and an able, ruthless captain. The _Bolide_; she and the\r\n_Enterprise_ had made a raid on Ithunn. The Gilgameshers had settled\r\nthere and one of their ships had brought that story in.\r\n\r\nAnd he recruited two ships at once on Melkarth, and there was a good\r\ndeal of mirth about that among the Tanith Space Vikings.\r\n\r\nMelkarth was strictly a poultry planet. Its people had sunk to the\r\nvillage-peasant level; they had no wealth worth taking or carrying\r\naway. It was, however, a place where a ship could be set down, and\r\nthere were women, and the locals had not lost the art of distillation,\r\nand made potent liquors. A crew could have fun there, much less\r\nexpensively than on a regular Viking base planet, and for the last\r\neight years a Captain Nial Burrik, of the _Fortuna_, had been occupying\r\nit, taking his ship out for occasional quick raids and spending most\r\nof the time living from day to day almost on the local level. Once\r\nin a while, a Gilgamesher would come in to see if he had anything to\r\ntrade. It was a Gilgamesher who brought the story to Tanith, and it\r\nwas almost two years old when he told it.\r\n\r\n\"We heard it from the people of the planet, the ones who live where\r\nBurrik had his base. First, there was a trading ship came in. You\r\nmay have heard of her; she is the one called the _Honest Horris_.\"\r\n\r\nTrask laughed at that. Her captain, Horris Sasstroff, called himself\r\n\"Honest Horris,\" a misnomer which he had also bestowed on his ship.\r\nHe was a trader of sorts. Even the Gilgameshers despised him, and\r\nnot even a Gilgamesher would have taken a wretched craft like the\r\n_Honest Horris_ to space.\r\n\r\n\"He had been to Melkarth before,\" the Gilgamesher said. \"He and\r\nBurrik are friends.\" He pronounced that like a final and damning\r\njudgment of both of them. \"The story the locals told our brethren\r\nof the _Fairdealer_ was that the _Honest Horris_ was landed beside\r\nBurrik's ship for ten days, when two other ships came in. They said\r\none had the blue crescent badge, and the other bore a green monster\r\nleaping from one star to another.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Enterprise_ and the _Starhopper_. He wondered why they'd gone\r\nto a planet like Melkarth. Maybe they knew in advance whom they'd\r\nfind there.\r\n\r\n\"The locals thought there would be fighting, but there was not.\r\nThere was a great feast, of all four crews. Then everything of\r\nvalue was loaded aboard the _Fortuna_, and all four ships lifted\r\nand spaced out together. They said Burrik left nothing of any worth\r\nwhatever behind; they were much disappointed at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have any of them been back since?\"\r\n\r\nAll three Gilgameshers, captain, exec, and priest, shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Gurrash of the _Fairdealer_ said it had been over a year\r\nbefore his ship put in there. He could still see where the landing\r\nlegs of the ships had pressed into the ground, but the locals said\r\nthey had not been back.\"\r\n\r\nThat made two more ships about which inquiries must be made. He\r\nwondered, for a moment, why in Gehenna Dunnan would want ships like\r\nthat; they must make the _Space Scourge_ and the _Lamia_ as he had\r\nfirst seen them look like units of the Royal Navy of Excalibur. Then\r\nhe became frightened, with an irrational retrospective fright at\r\nwhat might have happened. It could have, too, at any time in the\r\nlast year and a half; either or both of those ships could have come\r\nin on Tanith completely unsuspected. It was only by the sheerest\r\naccident that he had found out, even now, about them.\r\n\r\nEverybody else thought it was a huge joke. They thought it would be\r\na bigger joke if Dunnan sent those ships to Tanith now, when they\r\nwere warned and ready for them.\r\n\r\nThere were other things to worry about. One was the altering attitude of\r\nhis Majesty Angus I. When the _Space Scourge_ returned, the newly-titled\r\nBaron Valkanhayn brought with him, along with the princely title and the\r\ncommission as Viceroy of Tanith, a most cordial personal audiovisual\r\ngreeting, warm and friendly. Angus had made it seated at his desk, bare\r\nheaded and smoking a cigarette. The one which had come on the next ship\r\nout was just as cordial, but the King was not smoking and wore a small\r\ngold-circled cap-of-maintenance. By the time they had three ships in\r\nservice on scheduled three-month arrivals, a year and a half later, he\r\nwas speaking from his throne, wearing his crown and employing the first\r\nperson plural for himself and finally the third person singular for\r\nTrask. By the end of the fourth year, there was no audiovisual message\r\nfrom him in person, and a stiff complaint from Rovard Grauffis to the\r\neffect that His Majesty felt it unseemly for a subject to address his\r\nsovereign while seated, even by audiovisual. This was accompanied by a\r\nrather apologetic personal message from Grauffis--now Prime Minister--to\r\nthe effect that His Majesty felt compelled to stand on his royal dignity\r\nat all times, and that, after all, there was a difference between the\r\nposition and dignity of the Duke of Wardshaven and that of the Planetary\r\nKing of Gram.\r\n\r\nPrince Trask of Tanith couldn't quite see it. The King was simply\r\nthe first nobleman of the planet. Even kings like Rodolf of Excalibur\r\nor Napolyon of Flamberge didn't try to be anything more. Thereafter,\r\nhe addressed his greetings and reports to the Prime Minister, always\r\nwith a personal message, to which Grauffis replied in kind.\r\n\r\nNot only the form but also the content of the messages from Gram\r\nunderwent change. His Majesty was most dissatisfied. His Majesty was\r\ndeeply disappointed. His Majesty felt that His Majesty's colonial\r\nrealm of Tanith was not contributing sufficiently to the Royal\r\nExchequer. And his Majesty felt that Prince Trask was placing\r\nentirely too much emphasis upon trade and not enough upon raiding;\r\nafter all, why barter with barbarians when it was possible to take\r\nwhat you wanted from them by force?\r\n\r\nAnd there was the matter of the _Blue Comet_, Count Lionel of\r\nNewhaven's ship. His Majesty was most displeased that the Count of\r\nNewhaven was trading with Tanith from his own spaceport. All goods\r\nfrom Tanith should pass through the Wardshaven spaceport.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Rovard,\" he told the audiovisual camera which was recording\r\nhis reply to Grauffis. \"You saw the _Space Scourge_ when she came\r\nin, didn't you? That's what happens to a ship that raids a planet\r\nwhere there's anything worth taking. Beowulf is lousy with\r\nfissionables; they'll give us all the plutonium we can load, in\r\nexchange for gadolinium, which we sell them at about twice\r\nSword-World prices. We trade plutonium on Amaterasu for gadolinium,\r\nand get it for about half Sword-World prices.\" He pressed the\r\nstop-button, until he could remember the ancient formula. \"You may\r\nquote me as saying that whoever has advised His Majesty that that\r\nisn't good business is no friend to His Majesty or to the Realm.\r\n\r\n\"As for the complaint about the _Blue Comet_; as long as she is\r\nowned and operated by the Count of Newhaven, who is a stockholder\r\nin the Tanith Adventure, she has every right to trade here.\"\r\n\r\nHe wondered why His Majesty didn't stop Lionel of Newhaven from\r\nsending the _Blue Comet_ out from Gram. He found out from her\r\nskipper, the next time she came in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't dare, that's why. He's King as long as the great lords\r\nlike Count Lionel and Joris of Bigglersport and Alan of Northport\r\nwant him to be. Count Lionel has more men and more guns and\r\ncontragravity than he has, now, and that's without the help he'd get\r\nfrom everybody else. Everything's quiet on Gram now, even the war on\r\nSouthmain Continent's stopped. Everybody wants to keep it that way.\r\nEven King Angus isn't crazy enough to do anything to start a war.\r\nNot yet, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not _yet_?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Blue Comet_, who was one of Count Lionel's\r\nvassal barons, was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to know, Prince Trask,\" he said. \"Andray Dunnan's\r\ngrandmother was the King's mother. Her father was old Baron Zarvas\r\nof Blackcliffe. He was what was called an invalid, the last twenty\r\nyears of his life. He was always attended by two male nurses about\r\nthe size of Otto Harkaman. He was also said to be slightly\r\neccentric.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate grandfather of Duke Angus had always been a subject\r\nnice people avoided. The unfortunate grandfather of King Angus was\r\nprobably a subject everybody who valued their necks avoided.\r\n\r\nLothar Ffayle had also come out on the _Blue Comet_. He was just as\r\noutspoken.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going back. I'm transferring most of the funds of the Bank\r\nof Wardshaven out here; from now on, it'll be a branch of the Bank\r\nof Tanith. This is where the business is being done. It's getting\r\nimpossible to do business at all in Wardshaven. What little business\r\nthere is to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what's been happening?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, taxation, first. It seems the more money came in from here,\r\nthe higher taxes got on Gram. Discriminatory taxes, too; pinched the\r\nsmall landholding and industrial barons and favored a few big ones.\r\nBaron Spasso and his crowd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Baron Spasso, now?\"\r\n\r\nFfayle nodded. \"Of about half of Glaspyth. A lot of the Glaspyth\r\nbarons lost their baronies--some of them their heads--after Duke\r\nOmfray was run out. It seems there was a plot against the life of\r\nHis Majesty. It was exposed by the zeal and vigilance of Sir Garvan\r\nSpasso, who was elevated to the peerage and rewarded with the lands\r\nof the conspirators.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said business was bad, as business?\"\r\n\r\nFfayle nodded again. \"The big Tanith boom has busted. It got\r\noversold; everybody wanted in on it. And they should never have\r\nbuilt those two last ships, the _Speedwell_ and the _Goodhope_;\r\nthe return on them didn't justify it. Then, you're creating your\r\nown industries and building your own equipment and armament here;\r\nthat's caused a slump in industry on Gram. I'm glad Lavina Karvall\r\nhas enough money invested to live on. And finally, the consumers'\r\ngoods market is getting flooded with stuff that's coming in from\r\nhere and competing with Gram industry.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that was understandable. One of the ships that made the\r\nshuttle-trip to Gram would carry enough in her strong rooms, in gold\r\nand jewels and the like, to pay a handsome profit on the voyage. The\r\nbulk-goods that went into the cargo holds was practically taking a\r\nfree ride, so anything on hand, stuff that nobody would ordinarily\r\nthink of shipping in interstellar trade, went aboard. A two thousand\r\nfoot freighter had a great deal of cargo space.\r\n\r\nBaron Trask of Traskon hadn't even begun to realise what Tanith base\r\nwas going to cost Gram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration][Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the Beowulfers finished their hypership first.\r\nThey had started with everything but a little know-how which had\r\nbeen quickly learned. Amaterasu had had to begin by creating the\r\nindustry they needed to create the industry they needed to build a\r\nship. The Beowulf ship--she was named _Viking's Gift_--came in on\r\nTanith five and a half years after the _Nemesis_ and the _Space\r\nScourge_ had raided Beowulf; her skipper had fought a normal-drive\r\nship in that battle. Beside plutonium and radioactive isotopes, she\r\ncarried a general cargo of the sort of luxury-goods unique to\r\nBeowulf which could always find a market in interstellar trade.\r\n\r\nAfter selling the cargo and depositing the money in the Bank of\r\nTanith, the skipper of the _Viking's Gift_ wanted to know where\r\nhe could find a good planet to raid. They gave him a list, none\r\ntoo tough but all slightly above the chicken-stealing level, and\r\nanother list of planets he was _not_ to raid; planets with which\r\nTanith was trading.\r\n\r\nSix months later they learned that he had showed up on Khepera, with\r\nwhich they were now trading, and had flooded the market there with\r\nplundered textiles, hardware, ceramics and plastics. He had bought\r\nkregg-meat and hides.\r\n\r\n\"You see what you did, now?\" Harkaman clamored. \"You thought you\r\nwere making a customer; what you made was a competitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I made was an ally. If we ever do find Dunnan's planet, we'll\r\nneed a fleet to take it. A couple of Beowulf ships would help. You\r\nknow them; you fought them, too.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman had other worries. While cruising in _Corisande II_, he had\r\ncome in on Vitharr, one of the planets where Tanith ships traded, to\r\nfind it being raided by a Space Viking ship based on Xochitl. He had\r\nfought a short but furious ship-action, battering the invader until\r\nhe was glad to hyper out. Then he had gone directly to Xochitl,\r\narriving on the heels of the ship he had beaten, and had had it out\r\nboth with the captain and Prince Viktor, serving them with an\r\nultimatum to leave Tanith trade-planets alone in the future.\r\n\r\n\"How did they take it?\" Trask asked, when he returned to report.\r\n\r\n\"Just about the way you would have. Viktor said his people were\r\nSpace Vikings, not Gilgameshers. I told him we weren't Gilgameshers,\r\neither, as he'd find out on Xochitl the next time one of his ships\r\nraided one of our planets. Are you going to back me up? Of course,\r\nyou can always send Prince Viktor my head, and an apology--\"\r\n\r\n\"If I have to send him anything, I'll send him a sky full of ships\r\nand a planet full of hellburners. You did perfectly right, Otto;\r\nexactly what I'd have done in your place.\"\r\n\r\nThere the matter rested. There were no more raids by Xochitl ships\r\non any of their trade-planets. No mention of the incident was made\r\nin any of the reports sent back to Gram. The Gram situation was\r\ndeteriorating rapidly enough. Finally, there was an audiovisual\r\nmessage from Angus himself; he was seated on his throne, wearing\r\nhis crown, and he began speaking from the screen abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"We, Angus, King of Gram and Tanith, are highly displeased with our\r\nsubject, Lucas, Prince and Viceroy of Tanith; we consider ourselves\r\nvery badly served by Prince Trask. We therefore command him to return\r\nto Gram, and render to us account of his administration of our colony\r\nand realm of Tanith.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some hasty preparations, Trask recorded a reply. He was sitting\r\non a throne, himself, and he wore a crown just as ornate as King Angus',\r\nand robes of white and black Imhotep furs.\r\n\r\n\"We, Lucas, Prince of Tanith,\" he began, \"are quite willing to\r\nacknowledge the suzerainty of the King of Gram, formerly Duke of\r\nWardshaven. It is our earnest desire, if possible, to remain at\r\npeace and friendship with the King of Gram, and to carry on trade\r\nrelations with him and with his subjects.\r\n\r\n\"We must, however, reject absolutely any efforts on his part to\r\ndictate the internal policies of our realm of Tanith. It is our\r\nearnest hope,\"--dammit, he'd said \"earnest,\" he should have thought\r\nof some other word--\"that no act on the part of his Majesty the King\r\nof Gram will create any breach in the friendship existing between\r\nhis realm and ours.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree months later, the next ship, which had left Gram while King\r\nAngus' summons was still in hyperspace, brought Baron Rathmore.\r\nShaking hands with him as he left the landing craft, Trask wanted to\r\nknow if he'd been sent out as the new Viceroy. Rathmore started to\r\nlaugh and ended by cursing vilely.\r\n\r\n\"No. I've come out to offer my sword to the King of Tanith,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Prince of Tanith, for the time being,\" Trask corrected. \"The sword,\r\nhowever, is most acceptable. I take it you've had all of our blessed\r\nsovereign you can stomach?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucas, you have enough ships and men here to take Gram,\" Rathmore\r\nsaid. \"Proclaim yourself King of Tanith and then lay claim to the\r\nthrone of Gram and the whole planet would rise for you.\"\r\n\r\nRathmore had lowered his voice, but even so the open landing stage\r\nwas no place for this sort of talk. He said so, ordered a couple\r\nof the locals to collect Rathmore's luggage, and got him into a\r\nhall-car, taking him down to his living quarters. After they were\r\nin private, Rathmore began again:\r\n\r\n\"It's more than anybody can stand! There isn't one of the old great\r\nnobility he hasn't alienated, or one of the minor barons, the\r\nlandholders and industrialists, the people who were always the\r\nbackbone of Gram. And it goes from them down to the commonfolk.\r\nAssessments on the lords, taxes on the people, inflation to meet\r\nthe taxes, high prices, debased coinage. Everybody's being beggared\r\nexcept this rabble of new lords he has around him, and that slut of\r\na wife and her greedy kinfolk....\"\r\n\r\nTrask stiffened. \"You're not speaking of Queen Flavia, are you?\"\r\nhe asked softly.\r\n\r\nRathmore's mouth opened slightly. \"Great Satan, don't you know? No,\r\nof course not; the news would have come on the same ship I did. Why,\r\nAngus divorced Flavia. He claimed that she was incapable of giving\r\nhim an heir to the throne. He remarried immediately.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's name meant nothing to Trask; he did know of her father, a\r\nBaron Valdiva. He was lord of a small estate south of the Ward lands\r\nand west of Newhaven. Most of his people were out-and-out bandits\r\nand cattle-rustlers, and he was as close to being one himself as\r\nhe could get.\r\n\r\n\"Nice family he's married into. A credit to the dignity of the\r\nthrone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You wouldn't know this Lady-Demoiselle Evita; she was only\r\nseventeen when you left Gram, and hadn't begun to acquire a\r\nreputation outside her father's lands. She's made up for lost time\r\nsince, though. And she has enough uncles and aunts and cousins and\r\nex-lovers and what-not to fill out an infantry regiment, and every\r\none of them's at court with both hands out to grab everything they\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does Duke Joris like this?\" The Duke of Bigglersport was Queen\r\nFlavia's brother. \"I daresay he's less than delighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's hiring mercenaries, is what he's doing, and buying combat\r\ncontragravity. Lucas, why don't you come back? You have no idea what\r\na reputation you have on Gram, now. Everybody would rally to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, \"I have a throne, here on Tanith. On Gram I want\r\nnothing. I'm sorry for the way Angus turned out, I thought he'd make\r\na good King. But since he's made an intolerable King, the lords and\r\npeople of Gram will have to get rid of him for themselves. I have my\r\nown tasks, here.\"\r\n\r\nRathmore shrugged. \"I was afraid that would be it,\" he said. \"Well,\r\nI offered my sword; I won't take it back. I can help you in what\r\nyou're doing on Tanith.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe captain of the free Space Viking _Damnthing_ was named\r\nRoger-fan-Morvill Esthersan, which meant that he was some\r\nSword-Worlder's acknowledged bastard by a woman of one of the Old\r\nFederation planets. His mother's people could have been Nergalers;\r\nhe had coarse black hair, a mahogany-brown skin, and red-brown,\r\nalmost maroon, eyes. He tasted the wine the robot poured for him\r\nand expressed appreciation, then began unwrapping the parcel he\r\nhad brought in.\r\n\r\n\"Something I found while raiding on Tetragrammaton,\" he said.\r\n\"I thought you might like to have it. It was made on Gram.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an automatic pistol, with a belt and holster. The leather was\r\nbisonoid-hide; the buckle of the belt was an oval enameled with a\r\ncrescent, pale blue on black. The pistol was a plain 10-mm military\r\nmodel with grooved plastic grips; on the receiver it bore the stamp\r\nof the House of Hoylbar, the firearms manufacturers of Glaspyth.\r\nEvidently it was one of the arms Duke Omfray had provided for Andray\r\nDunnan's original mercenary company.\r\n\r\n\"Tetragrammaton?\" He glanced over to the Big Board; there was no\r\nprevious report from that planet. \"How long ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd say about three hundred hours. I came from there directly, less\r\nthan two hundred and fifty hours. Dunnan's ships had left the planet\r\nthree days before I got there.\"\r\n\r\nThat was practically sizzling hot. Well, something like that had to\r\nhappen, sooner or later. The Space Viking was asking him if he knew\r\nwhat sort of a place Tetragrammaton was.\r\n\r\nNeobarbarian, trying to recivilize in a crude way. Small population,\r\nconcentrated on one continent; farming and fisheries. A little heavy\r\nindustry, in a small way, at a couple of towns. They had some nuclear\r\npower, introduced a century or so ago by traders from Marduk, one of\r\nthe really civilized planets. They still depended on Marduk for\r\nfissionables; their export product was an abominably-smelling\r\nvegetable oil which furnished the base for delicate perfumes, and\r\nwhich nobody was ever able to synthesize properly.\r\n\r\n\"I heard they had steel mills in operation, now,\" the half-breed\r\nSpace Viking said. \"It seems that somebody on Rimmon has just\r\nre-invented the railroad, and they need more steel than they can\r\nproduce for themselves. I thought I'd raid Tetragrammaton for steel\r\nand trade it on Rimmon for a load of heaven-tea. When I got there,\r\nthough, the whole planet was in a mess; not raiding, but plain\r\nwanton destruction. The locals were just digging themselves out of\r\nit when I landed. Some of them, who didn't think they had anything\r\nat all left to lose, gave me a fight. I captured a few of them, to\r\nfind out what had happened. One of them had that pistol; he said\r\nhe'd taken it off a Space Viking he'd killed. The ships that raided\r\nthem were the _Enterprise_ and the _Yo-Yo_. I knew you'd want to\r\nhear about it. I got some of the locals' stories on tape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thank you. I'll want to hear those tapes. Now, you say you\r\nwant steel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I haven't any money. That's why I was going to raid\r\nTetragrammaton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nifflheim with the money; your cargo's paid for already. This,\"\r\nhe said, touching the pistol, \"and whatever's on the tapes.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey played off the tapes that evening. They weren't particularly\r\ninformative. The locals who had been interrogated hadn't been in\r\nactual contact with Dunnan's people except in combat. The man who\r\nhad been carrying the 10-mm Hoylbar was the best witness of the lot,\r\nand he knew little. He had caught one of them alone, shot him from\r\nbehind with a shotgun, taken his pistol, and then gotten away as\r\nquickly as he could. They had sent down landing craft, it seemed,\r\nand said they wanted to trade; then something must have happened,\r\nnobody knew what, and they had begun a massacre and sacked the town.\r\nAfter returning to their ships, they had opened fire with nuclear\r\nmissiles.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like Dunnan,\" Hugh Rathmore said in disgust. \"He just went\r\nkill-crazy. The bad blood of Blackcliffe.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are funny things about this,\" Boake Valkanhayn said. \"I'd say\r\nit was a terror-raid, but who in Gehenna was he trying to terrorize?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wondered about that, too.\" Harkaman frowned. \"This town where he\r\nlanded seems, such as it was, to have been the planetary capital.\r\nThey just landed, pretending friendship, which I can't see why they\r\nneeded to pretend, and then began looting and massacring. There\r\nwasn't anything of real value there; all they took was what the men\r\ncould carry themselves or stuff into their landing craft, and they\r\ndid that because they have what amounts to a religious taboo\r\nagainst landing anywhere and leaving without stealing something.\r\nThe real loot was at these two other towns; a steel mill and big\r\nstocks of steel at one, and all that skunk-apple oil at the other.\r\nSo what did they do? They dropped a five-megaton bomb on each one,\r\nand blew both of them to Em-See-Square. That was a terror-raid pure\r\nand simple, but as Boake inquires, just who were they terrorizing?\r\nIf there were big cities somewhere else on the planet, it would\r\nfigure. But there aren't. They blew out the two biggest cities,\r\nand all the loot in them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Then they wanted to terrorize somebody off the planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But nobody'd hear about it off-planet,\" somebody protested.\r\n\r\n\"The Mardukans would; they trade with Tetragrammaton,\" the\r\nacknowledged bastard of somebody named Morvill said. \"They have\r\na couple of ships a year there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Trask agreed. \"Marduk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, you think Dunnan's trying to terrorize _Marduk_?\" Valkanhayn\r\ndemanded. \"Great Satan, even he isn't crazy enough for that!\"\r\n\r\nBaron Rathmore started to say something about what Andray Dunnan\r\nwas crazy enough to do, and what his uncle was crazy enough to do.\r\nIt was just one of the cracks he had been making since he'd come\r\nto Tanith and didn't have to look over his shoulder while he was\r\nmaking them.\r\n\r\n\"I think he is, too,\" Trask said. \"I think that is exactly what he\r\nis doing. Don't ask me why; as Otto is fond of remarking, he's crazy\r\nand we aren't, and that gives him an advantage. But what have we\r\ngotten, since those Gilgameshers told us about his picking up\r\nBurrik's ship and the _Honest Horris_? Until today, we've heard\r\nnothing from any other Space Viking. What we have gotten was stories\r\nfrom Gilgameshers about raids on planets where they trade, and every\r\none of them is also a planet where Marduk ships trade. And in every\r\ncase, there has been little or nothing reported about valuable loot\r\ntaken. The stories are all about wanton and murderous bombings. I\r\nthink Andray Dunnan is making war on Marduk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he's crazier than his grandfather and his uncle both!\"\r\nRathmore cried.\r\n\r\n\"You mean, he's making a string of terror-raids on their trade\r\nplanets, hoping to pull the Mardukan space-navy away from the home\r\nplanet?\" Harkaman had stopped being incredulous. \"And when he gets\r\nthem all lured away, he'll make a fast raid?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I think. Remember our fundamental postulate: Dunnan is\r\ncrazy. Remember how he convinced himself that he was the rightful\r\nheir to the ducal crown of Wardshaven?\" And remember his insane\r\npassion for Elaine; he pushed that thought hastily from him. \"Now,\r\nhe's convinced that he's the greatest Space Viking in history. He\r\nhas to do something worthy of that distinction. When was the last\r\ntime anybody attacked a civilized planet? I don't mean Gilgamesh,\r\nI mean a planet like Marduk.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred and twenty years ago; Prince Havilgar of Haulteclere, six\r\nships, against Aton. Two ships got back. He didn't. Nobody's tried\r\nit since,\" Harkaman said.\r\n\r\n\"So Dunnan the Great will do it. I hope he tries,\" he surprised\r\nhimself by adding. \"That's provided I find out what happened. Then\r\nI could stop thinking about him.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a time when he had dreaded the possibility that somebody\r\nelse might kill Dunnan before he could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSeshat, Obidicut, Lugaluru, Audhumla.\r\n\r\nThe young man elevated by his father's death in the Dunnan raid to\r\nthe post of hereditary President of the democratic Republic of\r\nTetragrammaton had been sure that the Marduk ships which came to\r\nhis planet traded also on those. There had been some difficulty\r\nabout making contact, and the first face-to-face meeting had begun\r\nin an atmosphere of bitter distrust on his part. They had met out\r\nof doors; around them, spread wrecked and burned buildings, and\r\nhastily constructed huts and shelters, and wide spaces of charred\r\nand slagged rubble.\r\n\r\n\"They blew up the steel mill here, and the oil-refinery at Jannsboro.\r\nThey bombed and strafed the little farm-towns and villages. They\r\nscattered radioactives that killed as many as the bombing. And after\r\nthey had gone away, this other ship came.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Damnthing_? She bore the head of a beast with three very big horns?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the one. They did a little damage, at first. When the\r\ncaptain found out what had happened to us, he left some food and\r\nmedicines for us.\" Roger-fan-Morvill Esthersan hadn't mentioned that.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'd like to help you, if we can. Do you have nuclear power?\r\nWe can give you a little equipment. Just remember it of us, when\r\nyou're back on your feet; we'll be back to trade later. But don't\r\nthink you owe us anything. The man who did this to you is my enemy.\r\nNow, I want to talk to every one of your people who can tell me\r\nanything at all....\"\r\n\r\nSeshat was the closest; they went there first. They were too late.\r\nSeshat had had it already, and on the evidence of the radioactivity\r\ncounters, not too long ago. Four hundred hours at most. There had\r\nbeen two hellburners; the cities on which they had fallen were\r\nstill-smoking pits literally burned into the ground and the bedrock\r\nbelow, at the center of five hundred mile radii of slag and lava and\r\nscorched earth and burned forests. There had been a planetbuster; it\r\nhad started a major earthquake. And half a dozen thermonuclears.\r\nThere were probably quite a few survivors--a human planetary\r\npopulation is extremely hard to exterminate completely--but within\r\na century they'd be back to the loincloth and the stone hatchet.\r\n\r\n\"We don't even know Dunnan did it, personally,\" Paytrik Morland said.\r\n\"For all we know, he's down in an air-tight cave city on some planet\r\nnobody ever heard of, sitting on a golden throne, surrounded by a harem.\"\r\n\r\nHe had begun to suspect that Dunnan was doing something of just the\r\nsort. The Greatest Space Viking of History would naturally found a\r\nSpace Viking empire.\r\n\r\n\"An emperor goes out to look his empire over, now and then; I don't\r\nspend all my time on Tanith. Say we try Audhumla next. It's the\r\nfarthest away. We might get there while he's still shooting up\r\nObidicut and Lugaluru. Guatt, figure us a jump for it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the colored turbulence washed away and the screen cleared,\r\nAudhumla looked like Tanith or Khepera or Amaterasu or any other\r\nTerra-type planet, a big disk brilliant with reflected sunlight and\r\nglowing with starlit and moonlit atmosphere on the other. There was\r\na single rather large moon, and, in the telescopic screen, the usual\r\nmarkings of seas and continents and rivers and mountain-ranges. But\r\nthere was nothing to show....\r\n\r\nOh, yes; lights on the darkened side, and from the size they must be\r\nvast cities. All the available data for Audhumla was long out of\r\ndate; a considerable civilization must have developed in the last\r\nhalf dozen centuries.\r\n\r\nAnother light appeared, a hard blue-white spark that spread into a\r\nlarger, less brilliant yellow light. At the same time, all the\r\nalarm-devices in the command-room went into a pandemonium of jangling\r\nand flashing and squawking and howling and shouting. Radiation.\r\nEnergy-release. Contragravity distortion effects. Infra-red output. A\r\nwelter of indecipherable radio and communication-screen signals. Radar\r\nand scanner-ray beams from the planet.\r\n\r\nTrask's fist began hurting; he found that he had been pounding\r\nthe desk in front of him with it. He stopped it.\r\n\r\n\"We caught him, we caught him!\" he was yelling hoarsely. \"Full speed\r\nin, continuous acceleration, as much as we can stand. We'll worry\r\nabout decelerating when we're in shooting distance.\"\r\n\r\nThe planet grew steadily larger; Karffard was taking him at his word\r\nabout continuous acceleration. There'd be a Gehenna of a bill to pay\r\nwhen they started decelerating. On the planet, more bombs were going\r\noff just outside atmosphere beyond the sunset line.\r\n\r\n\"Ship observed. Altitude about a hundred to five hundred\r\nmiles--hundreds, not thousands--35° North Latitude, 15° west of\r\nthe sunset line. Ship is under fire, bomb explosions near her,\"\r\na voice whooped.\r\n\r\nSomebody else was yelling that the city lights were really burning\r\ncities, or burning forests. The first voice, having stopped, broke\r\nin again:\r\n\r\n\"Ship is visible in telescopic screen, just at the sunset line. And\r\nthere's another ship detected but not visible, somewhere around the\r\nequator, and a third one somewhere out of sight, we can just get the\r\nfringe of her contragravity field around the planet.\"\r\n\r\nThat meant there were two sides, and a fight. Unless Dunnan had\r\npicked up a third ship, somewhere. The telescopic view shifted;\r\nfor a moment the planet was completely off-screen, and then its\r\ncurvature came into the screen against a star-scattered background.\r\nThey were almost in to two thousand miles now; Karffard was yelling\r\nto stop acceleration and trying to put the ship into a spiral orbit.\r\nSuddenly they caught a glimpse of one of the ships.\r\n\r\n\"She's in trouble.\" That was Paul Koreff's voice. \"She's leaking air\r\nand water vapor like crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, is she a good guy or a bad guy?\" Morland was yelling back, as\r\nthough Koreff's spectroscopes could distinguish. Koreff ignored that.\r\n\r\n\"Another ship making signal,\" he said. \"She's the one coming up over\r\nthe equator. Sword-World impulse code; her communication-screen\r\ncombination, and an identify-yourself.\"\r\n\r\nKarffard punched out the combination as Koreff furnished it. While\r\nTrask was desperately willing his face into immobility, the screen\r\nlighted. It wasn't Andray Dunnan; that was a disappointment. It was\r\nalmost as good, though. His henchman, Sir Nevil Ormm.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir Nevil! A pleasant surprise,\" he heard himself saying.\r\n\"We last met on the terrace at Karvall House, did we not?\"\r\n\r\nFor once, the paper-white face of Andray Dunnan's _âme damnée_\r\nshowed expression, but whether it was fear, surprise, shock, hatred,\r\nanger, or what combination of them, Trask could no more than guess.\r\n\r\n\"Trask! Satan curse you...!\"\r\n\r\nThen the screen went blank. In the telescopic screen, the other ship\r\ncame on unfalteringly. Paul Koreff, who had gotten more data on\r\nmass, engine energy-output and dimensions, was identifying her as\r\nthe _Enterprise_.\r\n\r\n\"Well, go for her! Give her everything!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey didn't need the order; Vann Larch was speaking rapidly into his\r\nhand-phone, and Alvyn Karffard was hurling his voice all over the\r\n_Nemesis_, warning of sudden deceleration and direction change, and\r\nwhile he was speaking, things in the command room began sliding. In\r\nthe telescopic screen, the other ship was plainly visible; he could\r\nsee the oval patch of black with the blue crescent, and in his\r\nscreen Dunnan would be seeing the sword-impaled skull of the\r\n_Nemesis_.\r\n\r\nIf only he could be sure Dunnan was there to see it. If it had only\r\nbeen Dunnan's face, instead of Ormm's, that he had seen in the\r\nscreen. As it was, he couldn't be sure, and if one of the missiles\r\nthat were already going out made a lucky hit, he might never be\r\nsure. He didn't care who killed Dunnan, or how. All he wanted was\r\nto know that Dunnan's death had set him free from a self-assumed\r\nobligation that was now meaningless to him.\r\n\r\nThe _Enterprise_ launched counter-missiles; so did the _Nemesis_.\r\nThere were momentarily unbearable flashes of pure energy and from\r\nthem globes of incandescence spread and vanished. Something must\r\nhave gotten through; red lights flashed on the damage board. It had\r\nbeen something heavy enough even to jolt the huge mass of the\r\n_Nemesis_. At the same time, the other ship took a hit from\r\nsomething that would have vaporized her had she not been armored in\r\ncollapsium. Then, as they passed close together, guns hammered back\r\nand forth along with missiles, and then the _Enterprise_ was out of\r\nsight around the horizon.\r\n\r\nAnother ship, the size of Otto Harkaman's _Corisande II_, was\r\napproaching; she bore a tapering, red-nailed feminine hand dangling\r\na planet by a string. They rushed toward each other, planting a\r\ngarden of evanescent fire-flowers between them; they pounded one\r\nanother with guns, and then they sped apart. At the same time, Paul\r\nKoreff was picking up an impulse-code signal from the third,\r\ncrippled, ship; a screen combination. Trask punched it out as\r\nhe received it.\r\n\r\nA man in space armor was looking out of the screen. That was bad,\r\nif they had to suit up in the command room. They still had air;\r\nhis helmet was off, but it was attached and hinged back. On his\r\nbreastplate was a device of a dragonlike beast perched with its tail\r\naround a planet, and a crown above. He had a thin, high-cheeked\r\nface, with a vertical wrinkle between his eyes, and a clipped blond\r\nmustache.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, stranger. You're fighting my enemies; does that make\r\nyou a friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a friend of anybody who owns Andray Dunnan his enemy.\r\nSword-World ship _Nemesis_; I'm Prince Lucas Trask of Tanith,\r\ncommanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Royal Mardukan ship _Victrix_.\" The thin-faced man gave a wry\r\nlaugh. \"Not been living up to her name so well. I'm Prince Simon\r\nBentrik, commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you still battle-worthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can fire about half our guns; we still have a few missiles left.\r\nSeventy per cent of the ship's sealed off, and we've been holed in a\r\ndozen places. We have power enough for lift and some steering-way.\r\nWe can't make lateral way except at the expense of lift.\"\r\n\r\nWhich made the _Victrix_ practically a stationary target. He yelled\r\nover his shoulder at Karffard to cut speed all he could without\r\ntearing things apart.\r\n\r\n\"When that cripple comes into view, start circling around her. Get\r\ninto a tight circle above her.\" He turned back to the man in the\r\nscreen. \"If we can get ourselves slowed down enough, we'll do all we\r\ncan to cover you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All you can is all you can; thank you, Prince Trask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here comes the _Enterprise_!\" Karffard shouted, with obscenely\r\nblasphemous embellishments. \"She hairpinned on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do something about her!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVann Larch was already doing it. The _Enterprise_ had taken damage\r\nin the last exchange; Koreff's spectroscopes showed her halo-ed with\r\nair and water vapor. Her instruments would be getting the same\r\nstory from the _Nemesis_; wedge-shaped segments extending six to\r\neight decks in were sealed off in several places. Then the only\r\nthing that could be seen with certainty was the blaze of mutually\r\ndestroying missiles between. The short-range gun duel began and\r\nended as they passed.\r\n\r\nIn the screen, he had seen a fat round-nosed thing come up from the\r\n_Victrix_, curving far out ahead of the passing _Enterprise_. She\r\nwas almost out of sight around the planet when she ran head-on into\r\nit, and vanished in an awesome blaze. For a moment, he thought she\r\nhad been destroyed, then she lurched into sight and went around the\r\ncurvature of Audhumla.\r\n\r\nTrask and the Mardukan were shaking hands with themselves at each\r\nother in their screens; everybody in the _Nemesis_ command room was\r\nscreaming: \"Well shot, _Victrix_! Well shot!\"\r\n\r\nThen the _Yo-Yo_ was coming around again, and Vann Larch was saying,\r\n\"Gehenna with this fooling around! I'll fix the expurgated\r\nunprintability!\"\r\n\r\nHe yelled orders--a jumble of code letters and numbers--and things\r\nbegan going out. Most of them blew up in space. Then the _Yo-Yo_\r\nblew up, very quietly, as things do where there is no air to carry\r\nshock- and sound-waves, but very brilliantly. There was brief\r\ndaylight all over the night side of the planet.\r\n\r\n\"That was our planetbuster,\" Larch said. \"I don't know what we'll\r\nuse on Dunnan.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know we had one,\" Trask admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Otto had a couple built on Beowulf. The Beowulfers are good nuclear\r\nweaponeers.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Enterprise_ came back, hastily, to see what had blown up. Larch\r\nput off another entertainment of small stuff, with a fifty megaton\r\nthermonuclear, viewscreen-piloted, among them. It had its own\r\narsenal of small missiles, and it got through. In the telescopic\r\nscreen, a jagged hole was visible just below the equator of the\r\n_Enterprise_, the edges curling outward. Something, possibly a heavy\r\nmissile in an open tube, ready for launching, had gone off inside\r\nher. What the inside of the ship was like, or how many of her\r\ncompany were still alive, was hard to guess.\r\n\r\nThere were some, and her launchers were still spewing out missiles.\r\nThey were intercepted and blew up. The hull of the _Enterprise_\r\nbulked huge in the guidance-screen of the missile and filled it; the\r\njagged crater that had obliterated the bottom of Dunnan's blue\r\ncrescent blazon spread to fill the whole screen. The screen went\r\nmilky white as the pickup went off.\r\n\r\nAll the other screens blazed briefly, until their filters went on.\r\nEven afterward, they glared like the cloud-veiled sun of Gram at\r\nhigh noon. Finally, when the light-intensity had dropped and the\r\nfilters went off, there was nothing left of the _Enterprise_ but an\r\norange haze.\r\n\r\nSomebody--Paytrik, Baron Morland, he saw--was pounding him on the\r\nback and screaming inarticulately in his ear. A dozen space-armored\r\nofficers with planet-perched dragons on their breasts were crowding\r\nbeside Prince Bentrik in the screen from the _Victrix_, whooping\r\nlike drunken bisonoid-herders on payday night.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" he said, almost inaudibly, \"if I'll ever know if Andray\r\nDunnan was on that ship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nPrince Trask of Tanith and Prince Simon Bentrik were dining together\r\non an upper terrace of what had originally been the mansion house of\r\na Federation period plantation. It had been a number of other things\r\nsince; now it was the municipal building of a town that had grown\r\naround it, which had, somehow, escaped undamaged from the Dunnan\r\nblitz. Normally about five or ten thousand, the place was now jammed\r\nwith almost fifty thousand homeless refugees from half a dozen other\r\ntowns that had been destroyed, overflowing the buildings and\r\ncrowding into a sprawling camp of hastily built huts and shelters,\r\nand already permanent buildings were going up to accommodate them.\r\nEverybody, locals, Mardukans and Space Vikings, had been busy with\r\nthe work of relief and reconstruction; this was the first meal the\r\ntwo commanders had been able to share in any leisure at all. Prince\r\nBentrik's enjoyment of it was somewhat impaired by the fact that\r\nfrom where he sat he could see, in the distance, the sphere of his\r\ndisabled ship.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt we can get her off-planet again, let alone into hyperspace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll get you and your crew to Marduk in the _Nemesis_,\r\nthen.\" They were both speaking loudly, above the clank and clatter\r\nof machinery below. \"I hope you didn't think I'd leave you stranded\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how either of us will be received. Space Vikings\r\nhaven't been exactly popular on Marduk, lately. They may thank you\r\nfor bringing me back to stand trial,\" Bentrik said bitterly. \"Why,\r\nI'd have anybody shot who let his ship get caught as I did mine.\r\nThose two were down in atmosphere before I knew they'd come out of\r\nhyperspace.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they were down on the planet before your ship arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's ridiculous, Prince Trask!\" the Mardukan cried. \"You\r\ncan't hide a ship on a planet. Not from the kind of instruments we\r\nhave in the Royal Navy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have pretty fair detection ourselves,\" Trask reminded him.\r\n\"There's one place where you can do it. At the bottom of an ocean,\r\nwith a thousand or so feet of water over her. That's where I was\r\ngoing to hide the _Nemesis_, if I got here ahead of Dunnan.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Bentrik's fork stopped half way to his mouth. He lowered it\r\nslowly to his plate. That was a theory he'd like to accept, if he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\"But the locals. They didn't know about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"They wouldn't. They have no off-planet detection of their own. Come\r\nin directly over the ocean, out of the sun, and nobody'd see the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that a regular Space Viking trick?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I invented it myself, on the way from Seshat. But if Dunnan\r\nwanted to ambush your ship, he'd have thought of it, too. It's the\r\nonly practical way to do it.\"\r\n\r\nDunnan, or Nevil Ormm; he wished he knew, and was afraid he would go\r\non wishing all his life.\r\n\r\nBentrik started to pick up his fork again, changed his mind, and\r\nsipped from his wineglass instead.\r\n\r\n\"You may find you're quite welcome on Marduk, at that,\" he said.\r\n\"These raids have only been a serious problem in the last four\r\nyears. I believe, as you do, that this enemy of yours is responsible\r\nfor all of them. We have half the Royal Navy out now, patrolling our\r\ntrade-planets. Even if he wasn't aboard the _Enterprise_ when you\r\nblew her up, you've put a name on him and can tell us a good deal\r\nabout him.\" He set down the wineglass. \"Why, if it weren't so utterly\r\nridiculous, one might even think he was making war on Marduk.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Trask's viewpoint, it wasn't ridiculous at all. He merely\r\nmentioned that Andray Dunnan was psychotic and let it go at that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Victrix_ was not completely unrepairable, although quite beyond\r\nthe resources at hand. A fully equipped engineer-ship from Marduk\r\ncould patch her hull and replace her Dillinghams and her Abbot\r\nlift-and-drive engines and make her temporarily spaceworthy, until\r\nshe could be gotten to a shipyard. They concentrated on repairing\r\nthe _Nemesis_, and in another two weeks she was ready for the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe six hundred hour trip to Marduk passed pleasantly enough. The\r\nMardukan officers were good company, and found their Space Viking\r\nopposite numbers equally so. The two crews had become used to\r\nworking together on Audhumla, and mingled amicably off watch,\r\ninteresting themselves in each other's hobbies and listening avidly\r\nto tales of each other's home planets. The Space Vikings were\r\nsurprised and disappointed at the somewhat lower intellectual level\r\nof the Mardukans. They couldn't understand that; Marduk was supposed\r\nto be a civilized planet, wasn't it? The Mardukans were just as\r\nsurprised, and inclined to be resentful, that the Space Vikings all\r\nacted and talked like officers. Hearing of it, Prince Bentrik was\r\nalso puzzled. Fo'c'sle hands on a Mardukan ship belonged definitely\r\nto the lower orders.\r\n\r\n\"There's still too much free land and free opportunity on the\r\nSword-Worlds,\" Trask explained. \"Nobody does much bowing and\r\nscraping to the class above him; he's too busy trying to shove\r\nhimself up into it. And the men who ship out as Space Vikings are\r\nthe least class-conscious of the lot. Think my men may have trouble\r\non Marduk about that? They'll all insist on doing their drinking in\r\nthe swankiest places in town.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"No. I don't think so. Everybody will be so amazed that Space Vikings\r\naren't twelve feet tall, with three horns like a Zarathustra damnthing\r\nand a spiked tail like a Fafnir mantichore that they won't even notice\r\nanything less. Might do some good, in the long run. Crown Prince Edvard\r\nwill like your Space Vikings. He's much opposed to class distinctions\r\nand caste prejudices. Says they have to be eliminated before we can\r\nmake democracy really work.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mardukans talked a lot about democracy. They thought well of it;\r\ntheir government was a representative democracy. It was also a\r\nhereditary monarchy, if that made any kind of sense. Trask's efforts\r\nto explain the political and social structure of the Sword-Worlds\r\nmet the same incomprehension from Bentrik.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it sounds like feudalism to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right; that's what it is. A king owes his position to the\r\nsupport of his great nobles; they owe theirs to their barons and\r\nlandholding knights; they owe theirs to their people. There are\r\nlimits beyond which none of them can go; after that, their vassals\r\nturn on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose the people of some barony rebel? Won't the king send\r\ntroops to support the baron?\"\r\n\r\n\"What troops? Outside a personal guard and enough men to police the\r\nroyal city and hold the crown lands, the king has no troops. If he\r\nwants troops, he has to get them from his great nobles; they have to\r\nget them from their vassal barons, who raise them by calling out\r\ntheir people.\" That was another source of dissatisfaction with King\r\nAngus of Gram; he had been augmenting his forces by hiring\r\noff-planet mercenaries. \"And the people won't help some other baron\r\noppress his people; it might be their turn next.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You mean, the people are armed?\" Prince Bentrik was incredulous.\r\n\r\n\"Great Satan, aren't yours?\" Prince Trask was equally surprised.\r\n\"Then your democracy's a farce, and the people are only free on\r\nsufferance. If their ballots aren't secured by arms, they're\r\nworthless. Who has the arms on your planet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the King?\"\r\n\r\nPrince Bentrik was shocked. Certainly not; horrid idea. That would\r\nbe ... why, it would be _despotism_! Besides, the King wasn't the\r\nGovernment, at all; the Government ruled in the King's name. There\r\nwas the Assembly; the Chamber of Representatives, and the Chamber of\r\nDelegates. The people elected the Representatives, and the\r\nRepresentatives elected the Delegates, and the Delegates elected the\r\nChancellor. Then, there was the Prime Minister; he was appointed by\r\nthe King, but the King had to appoint him from the party holding the\r\nmost seats in the Chamber of Representatives, and he appointed the\r\nMinisters, who handled the executive work of the Government, only\r\ntheir subordinates in the different Ministries were career-officials\r\nwho were selected by competitive examination for the bottom jobs and\r\npromoted up the bureaucratic ladder from there.\r\n\r\nThis left Trask wondering if the Mardukan constitution hadn't been\r\ndevised by Goldberg, the legendary Old Terran inventor who always\r\ndid everything the hard way. It also left him wondering just how in\r\nGehenna the Government of Marduk ever got anything done.\r\n\r\nMaybe it didn't. Maybe that was what saved Marduk from having a real\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what prevents the Government from enslaving the people?\r\nThe people can't; you just told me that they aren't armed, and\r\nthe Government is.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued, pausing now and then for breath, to catalogue every\r\ntyranny he had ever heard of, from those practiced by the Terran\r\nFederation before the Big War to those practiced at Eglonsby on\r\nAmaterasu by Pedrosan Pedro. A few of the very mildest were pushing\r\nthe nobles and people of Gram to revolt against Angus I.\r\n\r\n\"And in the end,\" he finished, \"the Government would be the only\r\nproperty owner and the only employer on the planet, and everybody\r\nelse would be slaves, working at assigned tasks, wearing\r\nGovernment-issued clothing and eating Government food, their\r\nchildren educated as the Government prescribes and trained for jobs\r\nselected for them by the Government, never reading a book or seeing\r\na play or thinking a thought that the Government had not\r\napproved....\"\r\n\r\nMost of the Mardukans were laughing, now. Some of them were accusing\r\nhim of being just too utterly ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the people _are_ the Government. The people would not\r\nlegislate themselves into slavery.\"\r\n\r\nHe wished Otto Harkaman were there. All he knew of history was the\r\nlittle he had gotten from reading some of Harkaman's books, and the\r\nlong, rambling conversations aboard ship in hyperspace or in the\r\nevenings at Rivington. But Harkaman, he was sure, could have\r\nfurnished hundreds of instances, on scores of planets and over ten\r\ncenturies of time, in which people had done exactly that and hadn't\r\nknown what they were doing, even after it was too late.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"They have something about like that on Aton,\" one of the Mardukan\r\nofficers said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Aton; that's a dictatorship, pure and simple. That Planetary\r\nNationalist gang got into control fifty years ago, during the crisis\r\nafter the war with Baldur....\"\r\n\r\n\"They were voted into power by the people, weren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; they were,\" Prince Bentrik said gravely. \"It was an emergency\r\nmeasure, and they were given emergency powers. Once they were in,\r\nthey made the emergency permanent.\"\r\n\r\n\"That couldn't happen on Marduk!\" a young nobleman declared.\r\n\r\n\"It could if Zaspar Makann's party wins control of the Assembly at\r\nthe next election,\" somebody else said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then Marduk's safe! The sun'll go nova first,\" one of the\r\njunior Royal Navy officers said.\r\n\r\nAfter that, they began talking about women, a subject any spaceman\r\nwill drop any other subject to discuss.\r\n\r\nTrask made a mental note of the name of Zaspar Makann, and took\r\noccasion to bring it up in conversation with his shipboard guests.\r\nEvery time he talked about Makann to two or more Mardukans, he heard\r\nat least three or more opinions about the man. He was a political\r\ndemagogue; on that everybody agreed. After that, opinions diverged.\r\n\r\nMakann was a raving lunatic, and all the followers he had were a\r\nhandful of lunatics like him. He might be a lunatic, but he had a\r\ndangerously large following. Well, not so large; maybe they'd pick\r\nup a seat or so in the Assembly, but that was doubtful--not enough\r\nof them in any representative district to elect an Assemblyman. He\r\nwas just a smart crook, milking a lot of half-witted plebeians for\r\nall he could get out of them. Not just plebes, either; a lot of\r\nindustrialists were secretly financing him, in hope that he would\r\nhelp them break up the labor unions. You're nuts; everybody knew the\r\nlabor unions were backing him, hoping he'd scare the employers into\r\ngranting concessions. You're both nuts; he was backed by the\r\nmercantile interests; they were hoping he'd run the Gilgameshers\r\noff the planet.\r\n\r\nWell, that was one thing you had to give him credit for. He wanted\r\nto run out the Gilgameshers. Everybody was in favor of that.\r\n\r\nNow, Trask could remember something he'd gotten from Harkaman.\r\nThere had been Hitler, back at the end of the First Century\r\nPre-Atomic; hadn't he gotten into power because everybody was\r\nin favor of running out the Christians, or the Moslems, or the\r\nAlbigensians, or somebody?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nMarduk had three moons; a big one, fifteen hundred miles in\r\ndiameter, and two insignificant twenty-mile chunks of rock. The big\r\none was fortified, and a couple of ships were in orbit around it.\r\nThe _Nemesis_ was challenged as she emerged from her last hyperjump;\r\nboth ships broke orbit and came out to meet her, and several more\r\nwere detected lifting away from the planet.\r\n\r\nPrince Bentrik took the communication screen, and immediately\r\nencountered difficulties. The commandant, even after the situation\r\nhad been explained twice to him, couldn't understand. A Royal Navy\r\nfleet unit knocked out in a battle with Space Vikings was bad\r\nenough, but being rescued and brought to Marduk by another Space\r\nViking simply didn't make sense. He then screened the Royal Palace\r\nat Malverton, on the planet; first he was icily polite to somebody\r\nseveral echelons below him in the peerage, and then respectfully\r\npolite to somebody he addressed as Prince Vandarvant. Finally, after\r\nsome minutes' wait, a frail, white-haired man in a little black\r\ncap-of-maintenance appeared in the screen. Prince Bentrik instantly\r\nsprang to his feet. So did all the other Mardukans in the command\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty! I am most deeply honored!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right, Simon?\" the old gentleman asked solicitously.\r\n\"They haven't done anything to you, have they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Saved my life, and my men's, and treated me like a friend and\r\na comrade, Your Majesty. Have I your permission to present,\r\ninformally, their commander, Prince Trask of Tanith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed you may, Simon. I owe the gentleman my deepest thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty, Mikhyl the Eighth, Planetary King of Marduk,\" Prince\r\nBentrik said. \"His Highness, Lucas, Prince Trask, Planetary Viceroy\r\nof Tanith for his Majesty Angus the First of Gram.\"\r\n\r\nThe elderly monarch bowed his head slightly; Trask bowed a little\r\nmore deeply, from the waist.\r\n\r\n\"I am very happy, Prince Trask, first, I confess, at the safe return\r\nof my kinsman Prince Bentrik, and then at the honor of meeting one\r\nin the confidence of my fellow sovereign King Angus of Gram. I will\r\nnever be ungrateful for what you did for my cousin and for his\r\nofficers and men. You must stay at the Palace while you are on this\r\nplanet; I am giving orders for your reception, and I wish you to be\r\nformally presented to me this evening.\" He hesitated briefly. \"Gram;\r\nthat is one of the Sword-Worlds, is it not?\" Another brief\r\nhesitation. \"Are you really a Space Viking, Prince Trask?\"\r\n\r\nMaybe he'd expected Space Vikings to have three horns and a spiked\r\ntail and stand twelve feet tall, himself.\r\n\r\nIt took several hours for the _Nemesis_ to get into orbit. Bentrik\r\nspent most of them in a screen-booth, and emerged visibly relieved.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody's going to be sticky about what happened on Audhumla,\" he\r\ntold Trask. \"There will be a Board of Inquiry. I'm afraid I had to\r\nmix you up in that. It's not only about the action on Audhumla;\r\neverybody from the Space Minister down wants to hear what you know\r\nabout this fellow Dunnan. Like yourself, we all hope he went to\r\nEm-See-Square along with his flagship, but we can't take it for\r\ngranted. We have over a dozen trade-planets to protect, and he's\r\nhit more than half of them already.\"\r\n\r\nThe process of getting into orbit took them around the planet\r\nseveral times, and it was a more impressive spectacle at each\r\ncircuit. Of course, Marduk had a population of almost two billion,\r\nand had been civilized, with no hiatus of Neobarbarism, since it\r\nhad first been colonized in the Fourth Century. Even so, the Space\r\nVikings were amazed--and stubbornly refusing to show it--at what\r\nthey saw in the telescopic screens.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that city!\" Paytrik Morland whispered. \"We talk about the\r\ncivilized planets, but I never realized they were anything like\r\nthis. Why, this makes Excalibur look like Tanith!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city was Malverton, the capital; like any city of a\r\ncontragravity-using people, it lay in a rough circle of buildings\r\ntowering out of green interspaces, surrounded by the smaller circles\r\nof spaceports and industrial suburbs. The difference was that any of\r\nthese were as large as Camelot on Excalibur or four Wardshavens on\r\nGram, and Malverton itself was almost half the size of the whole\r\nbarony of Traskon.\r\n\r\n\"They aren't any more civilized that we are, Paytrik. There are just\r\nmore of them. If there were two billion people on Gram--which I hope\r\nthere never will be--Gram would have cities like this, too.\"\r\n\r\nOne thing; the government of a planet like Marduk would have to\r\nbe something more elaborate than the loose feudalism of the\r\nSword-Worlds. Maybe this Goldberg-ocracy of theirs had been forced\r\nupon them by the sheer complexity of the population and its\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nAlvyn Karffard took a quick look around him to make sure none\r\nof the Mardukans were in earshot.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care how many people they have,\" he said. \"Marduk can be\r\nhad. A wolf never cares how many sheep there are in a flock. With\r\ntwenty ships, we could take this planet like we took Eglonsby.\r\nThere'd be losses coming in, sure, but after we were in and down,\r\nwe'd have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where would we get twenty ships?\"\r\n\r\nTanith, at a pinch, could muster five or six, counting the free\r\nSpace Vikings who used the base facilities; they would have to leave\r\na couple to hold the planet. Beowulf had one, and another almost\r\ncompleted, and now there was an Amaterasu ship. But to assemble a\r\nSpace Viking armada of twenty.... He shook his head. The real reason\r\nwhy Space Vikings had never raided a civilized planet successfully\r\nhad always been their inability to combine under one command in\r\nsufficient strength.\r\n\r\nBesides, he didn't want to raid Marduk. A raid, if successful, would\r\nyield immense treasures, but cause a hundred, even a thousand, times\r\nas much destruction, and he didn't want to destroy anything\r\ncivilized.\r\n\r\nThe landing stages of the palace were crowded when he and Prince\r\nBentrik landed, and, at a discreet distance, swarms of air-vehicles\r\ncircled, creating a control problem for the police. Parting from\r\nBentrik, he was escorted to the suite prepared for him; it was\r\nluxurious in the extreme but scarcely above Sword-World standards.\r\nThere were a surprising number of human servants, groveling and\r\nfawning and getting underfoot and doing work robots could have been\r\ndoing better. What robots there were were inefficient, and much work\r\nand ingenuity had been lavished on efforts to copy human form to the\r\ndetriment of function.\r\n\r\nAfter getting rid of most of the superfluous servants, he put on a\r\nscreen and began sampling the newscasts. There were telescopic views\r\nof the _Nemesis_ from some craft on orbit nearby, and he watched the\r\nofficers and men of the _Victrix_ being disembarked; there were\r\nother views of their landing at some naval installation on the\r\nground, and he could see reporters being chevied away by Navy\r\nground-police. And there was a wide range of commentary opinion.\r\n\r\nThe Government had already denied that, (1) Prince Bentrik had\r\ncaptured the _Nemesis_ and brought her in as a prize, and, (2) the\r\nSpace Vikings had captured Prince Bentrik and were holding him for\r\nransom. Beyond that, the Government was trying to sit on the whole\r\nstory, and the Opposition was hinting darkly at corrupt deals and\r\nsinister plots. Prince Bentrik arrived in the midst of an\r\nimpassioned tirade against pusillanimous traitors surrounding his\r\nMajesty who were betraying Marduk to the Space Vikings.\r\n\r\n\"Why doesn't your Government publish the facts and put a stop to\r\nthat nonsense?\" Trask asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let them rave,\" Bentrik replied. \"The longer the Government\r\nwaits, the more they'll be ridiculed when the facts are published.\"\r\n\r\nOr, the more people will be convinced that the Government had\r\nsomething to hush up, and had to take time to construct a plausible\r\nstory. He kept the thought to himself. It was their government; how\r\nthey mismanaged it was their own business. He found that there was\r\nno bartending robot; he had to have a human servant bring drinks. He\r\nmade up his mind to have a few of the _Nemesis_ robots sent down to him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe formal presentation would be in the evening; there would be a\r\ndinner first, and because Trask had not yet been formally presented,\r\nhe couldn't dine with the King, but because he was, or claimed to\r\nbe, Viceroy of Tanith, he ranked as a chief of state and would dine\r\nwith the Crown Prince, to whom there would be an informal\r\nintroduction first.\r\n\r\nThis took place in a small ante-chamber off the banquet hall; the\r\nCrown Prince and Crown Princess and Princess Bentrik were there when\r\nthey arrived. The Crown Prince was a man of middle age, graying at\r\nthe temples, with the glassy stare that betrayed contact lenses. The\r\nresemblance between him and his father was apparent; both had the\r\nsame studious and impractical expression, and might have been\r\nprofessors on the same university faculty. He shook hands with\r\nTrask, assuring him of the gratitude of the Court and Royal Family.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Simon is next in succession, after myself and my little\r\ndaughter,\" he said. \"That's too close to take chances with him.\" He\r\nturned to Bentrik. \"I'm afraid this is your last space adventure,\r\nSimon. You'll have to be a spaceport spaceman from now on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan't be sorry,\" Princess Bentrik said. \"And if anybody owes\r\nPrince Trask gratitude, I do.\" She pressed his hands warmly. \"Prince\r\nTrask, my son wants to meet you, very badly. He's ten years old, and\r\nhe thinks Space Vikings are romantic heroes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He should be one, for a while.\"\r\n\r\nHe should just see a planet Space Vikings had raided.\r\n\r\nMost of the people at the upper end of the table were\r\ndiplomats--ambassadors from Odin and Baldur and Isis and Ishtar and\r\nAton and the other civilized worlds. No doubt they hadn't actually\r\nexpected horns and a spiked tail, or even tattooing and a nose ring,\r\nbut after all, Space Vikings were just some sort of Neobarbarians,\r\nweren't they? On the other hand, they had all seen views and gotten\r\ndescriptions of the _Nemesis_, and had heard about the ship-action\r\non Audhumla, and this Prince Trask--a Space Viking prince; that\r\nsounded civilized enough--had saved a life with only three other\r\nlives, one almost at an end, between it and the throne. And they had\r\nheard about the screen conversation with King Mikhyl. So they were\r\ncourteous through the meal, and tried to get as close as possible to\r\nhim in the procession to the throne room.\r\n\r\nKing Mikhyl wore a golden crown topped by the planetary emblem,\r\nwhich must have weighed twice as much as a combat helmet, and\r\nfur-edged robes that would weigh more than a suit of space armor.\r\nThey weren't nearly as ornate, though, as the regalia of King Angus\r\nI of Gram. He rose to clasp Prince Bentrik's hand, calling him \"dear\r\ncousin,\" and congratulating him on his gallant fight and fortunate\r\nescape. That knocks any court-martial talk on the head, Trask\r\nthought. He remained standing to shake hands with Trask, calling him\r\n\"valued friend to me and my house.\" First person singular; that must\r\nbe causing some lifted eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThen the King sat down, and the rest of the roomful filed up onto\r\nthe dais to be received, and finally it was over and the king rose\r\nand proceeded, followed by his immediate suite between the bowing\r\nand curtsying court and out the wide doors. After a decent interval,\r\nCrown Prince Edvard escorted him and Prince Bentrik down the same\r\nroute, the others falling in behind, and across the hall to the\r\nballroom, where there was soft music and refreshments. It wasn't too\r\nunlike a court reception on Excalibur, except that the drinks and\r\ncanapes were being dispensed by human servants.\r\n\r\nHe was wondering what sort of court functions Angus the First of\r\nGram was holding by now.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour, a posse of court functionaries approached and\r\ninformed him that it had pleased his Majesty to command Prince Trask\r\nto attend him in his private chambers. There was an audible gasp at\r\nthis; both Prince Bentrik and the Crown Prince were trying not to\r\ngrin too broadly. Evidently this didn't happen too often. He followed\r\nthe functionaries from the ballroom, and the eyes of everybody else\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOld King Mikhyl received him alone, in a small, comfortably shabby\r\nroom behind vast ones of incredible splendor. He wore fur-lined\r\nslippers and a loose robe with a fur collar, and his little black\r\ncap-of-maintenance. He was standing when Trask entered; when the\r\nguards closed the door and left them alone, he beckoned Trask to\r\na couple of chairs, with a low table, on which were decanters and\r\nglasses and cigars, between.\r\n\r\n\"It's a presumption on royal authority to summon you from the\r\nballroom,\" he began, after they had seated themselves and filled\r\nglasses. \"You are quite the cynosure, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm grateful to Your Majesty. It's both comfortable and quiet here,\r\nand I can sit down. Your Majesty was the center of attention in the\r\nthrone room, yet I seemed to detect a look of relief as you left it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I try to hide it, as much as possible.\" The old King took off the\r\nlittle gold-circled cap and hung it on the back of his chair.\r\n\"Majesty can be rather wearying, you know.\"\r\n\r\nSo he could come here and put it off. Trask felt that some gesture\r\nshould be made on his own part. He unfastened the dress-dagger from\r\nhis belt and laid it on the table. The King nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Now, we can be a couple of honest tradesmen, our shops closed for\r\nthe evening, relaxing over our wine and tobacco,\" he said. \"Eh,\r\nGoodman Lucas?\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed like an initiation into a secret society whose ritual he\r\nmust guess at step by step.\r\n\r\n\"Right, Goodman Mikhyl.\"\r\n\r\nThey lifted their glasses to each other and drank; Goodman Mikhyl\r\noffered cigars, and Goodman Lucas held a light for him.\r\n\r\n\"I hear a few hard things about your trade, Goodman Lucas.\"\r\n\r\n\"All true, and mostly understated. We're professional murderers and\r\nrobbers, as one of my fellow tradesmen says. The worst of it is that\r\nrobbery and murder become just that: a trade, like servicing robots\r\nor selling groceries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you fought two other Space Vikings to cover my cousin's\r\ncrippled _Victrix_. Why?\"\r\n\r\nSo he must tell his tale, so worn and smooth, again. King Mikhyl's\r\ncigar went out while he listened.\r\n\r\n\"And you have been hunting him ever since? And now, you can't be\r\nsure whether you killed him or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I didn't. The man in the screen is the only man Dunnan\r\ncan really trust. One or the other would stay wherever he has his\r\nbase all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you do kill him; what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go on trying to make a civilized planet of Tanith. Sooner or\r\nlater, I'll have one quarrel too many with King Angus, and then we\r\nwill be our Majesty Lucas the First of Tanith, and we will sit on a\r\nthrone and receive our subjects. And I'll be glad when I can get my\r\ncrown off and talk to a few men who call me 'shipmate,' instead of\r\n'Your Majesty.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Well, it would violate professional ethics for me to advise a\r\nsubject to renounce his sovereign, of course, but that might be an\r\nexcellent thing. You met the ambassador from Ithavoll at dinner, did\r\nyou not? Three centuries ago, Ithavoll was a colony of Marduk--it\r\nseems we can't afford colonies, any more--and it seceded from us.\r\nIthavoll was then a planet like your Tanith seems to be. Today, it\r\nis a civilized world, and one of Marduk's best friends. You know,\r\nsometimes I think a few lights are coming on again, here and there\r\nin the Old Federation. If so, you Space Vikings are helping to light\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the planets we use as bases, and the things we teach the\r\nlocals?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, too, of course. Civilization needs civilized technologies.\r\nBut they have to be used for civilized ends. Do you know anything\r\nabout a Space Viking raid on Aton, over a century ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Six ships from Haulteclere; four destroyed, the other two returned\r\ndamaged and without booty.\"\r\n\r\nThe King of Marduk nodded.\r\n\r\n\"That raid saved civilization on Aton. There were four great\r\nnations; the two greatest were at the brink of war, and the others\r\nwere waiting to pounce on the exhausted victor and then fight each\r\nother for the spoils. The Space Vikings forced them to unite. Out of\r\nthat temporary alliance came the League for Common Defense, and from\r\nthat the Planetary Republic. The Republic's a dictatorship, now, and\r\njust between Goodman Mikhyl and Goodman Lucas it's a nasty one and\r\nour Majesty's Government doesn't like it at all. It will be smashed\r\nsooner or later, but they'll never go back to divided sovereignty\r\nand nationalism again. The Space Vikings frightened them out of that\r\nwhen the dangers inherent in it couldn't. Maybe this man Dunnan will\r\ndo the same for us on Marduk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have troubles?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've seen decivilized planets. How does it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know how it's happened on a good many: War. Destruction of cities\r\nand industries. Survivors among ruins, too busy keeping their own\r\nbodies alive to try to keep civilization alive. Then they lose all\r\nknowledge of how to be civilized.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's catastrophic decivilization. There is also decivilization by\r\nerosion, and while it's going on, nobody notices it. Everybody is\r\nproud of their civilization, their wealth and culture. But trade is\r\nfalling off; fewer ships come in each year. So there is boastful\r\ntalk about planetary self-sufficiency; who needs off-planet trade\r\nanyhow? Everybody seems to have money, but the government is always\r\nbroke. Deficit spending--and always the vital social services for\r\nwhich the government has to spend money. The most vital one, of\r\ncourse, is buying votes to keep the government in power. And it gets\r\nharder for the government to get anything done.\r\n\r\n\"The soldiers are sloppier at drill, and their uniforms and weapons\r\naren't taken care of. The noncoms are insolent. And more and more\r\nparts of the city are dangerous at night, and then even in the\r\ndaytime. And it's been years since a new building went up, and the\r\nold ones aren't being repaired any more.\"\r\n\r\nTrask closed his eyes. Again, he could feel the mellow sun of Gram\r\non his back, and hear the laughing voices on the lower terrace, and\r\nhe was talking to Lothar Ffayle and Rovard Grauffis and Alex Gorram\r\nand Cousin Nikkolay and Otto Harkaman. He said:\r\n\r\n\"And finally, nobody bothers fixing anything up. And the\r\npower-reactors stop, and nobody seems to be able to get them started\r\nagain. It hasn't quite gotten that far on the Sword-Worlds yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It hasn't here, either. Yet.\" Goodman Mikhyl slipped away; King\r\nMikhyl VIII looked across the low table at his guest. \"Prince Trask,\r\nhave you heard of a man named Zaspar Makann?\"\r\n\r\n\"Occasionally. Nothing good about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the most dangerous man on this planet,\" the King said. \"And I\r\ncan make nobody believe it. Not even my son.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nPrince Bentrik's ten-year-old son, Count Steven of Ravary, wore the\r\nuniform of an ensign of the Royal Navy; he was accompanied by his\r\ntutor, an elderly Navy captain. They both stopped in the doorway\r\nof Trask's suite, and the boy saluted smartly.\r\n\r\n\"Permission to come aboard, sir?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome aboard, count; captain. Belay the ceremony and find seats;\r\nyou're just in time for second breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nAs they sat down, he aimed his ultraviolet light-pencil at a serving\r\nrobot. Unlike Mardukan robots, which looked like surrealist\r\nconceptions of Pre-Atomic armored knights, it was a smooth ovoid\r\nfloating a few inches from the floor on its own contragravity; as it\r\napproached, its top opened like a bursting beetle shell and hinged\r\ntrays of food swung out. The boy looked at it in fascination.\r\n\r\n\"Is that a Sword-World robot, sir, or did you capture it somewhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's one of our own.\" He was pardonably proud; it had been built on\r\nTanith a year before. \"Has an ultrasonic dishwasher underneath, and\r\nit does some cooking on top, at the back.\"\r\n\r\nThe elderly captain was, if anything, even more impressed than his\r\nyoung charge. He knew what went into it, and he had some conception\r\nof the society that would develop things like that.\r\n\r\n\"I take it you don't use many human servants, with robots like\r\nthat,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not many. We're all low-population planets, and nobody wants to\r\nbe a servant.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have too many people on Marduk, and all of them want soft jobs\r\nas nobles' servants,\" the captain said. \"Those that want any kind\r\nof jobs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need all your people for fighting men, don't you?\" the boy\r\ncount asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we need a good many. The smallest of our ships will carry\r\nfive hundred men; most of them around eight hundred.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain lifted an eyebrow. The complement of the _Victrix_ had\r\nbeen three hundred, and she'd been a big ship. Then he nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Of course. Most of them are ground-fighters.\"\r\n\r\nThat started Count Steven off. Questions, about battles and raids\r\nand booty and the planets Trask had seen.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I were a Space Viking!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can't be, Count Ravary. You're an officer of the Royal\r\nNavy. You're supposed to fight Space Vikings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't fight you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd have to, if the King commanded,\" the old captain told him.\r\n\r\n\"No. Prince Trask is my friend. He saved my father's life.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I won't fight you, either, count. We'll make a lot of\r\nfireworks, and then we'll each go home and claim victory. How would\r\nthat be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard of things like that,\" the captain said. \"We had a war\r\nwith Odin, seventy years ago, that was mostly that sort of battles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, the King is Prince Trask's friend, too,\" the boy insisted.\r\n\"Father and Mummy heard him say so, right on the Throne. Kings don't\r\nlie when they're on the Throne, do they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Kings don't,\" Trask told him.\r\n\r\n\"Ours is a good King,\" the young Count of Ravary declared proudly.\r\n\"I would do anything my King commanded. Except fight Prince Trask.\r\nMy house owes Prince Trask a debt.\"\r\n\r\nTrask nodded approvingly. \"That's the way a Sword-World noble would\r\ntalk, Count Steven,\" he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Board of Inquiry, that afternoon, was more like a small and very\r\nsedate cocktail party. An Admiral Shefter, who seemed to be very\r\nhigh high-brass, presided while carefully avoiding the appearance\r\nof doing so. Alvyn Karffard and Vann Larch and Paytrik Morland were\r\nthere from the _Nemesis_, and Bentrik and several of the officers\r\nfrom the _Victrix_, and there were a couple of Naval Intelligence\r\nofficers, and somebody from Operational Planning, and from Ship\r\nConstruction and Research & Development. They chatted pleasantly\r\nand in a deceptively random manner for a while. Then Shefter said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's no blame or censure of any sort for the way Commodore\r\nPrince Bentrik was surprised. That couldn't have been avoided, at\r\nthe time.\" He looked at the Research & Development officer. \"It\r\nshouldn't be allowed to happen many more times, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not many more, sir. I'd say it'll take my people a month, and then\r\nthe time it'll take to get all the ships equipped as they come in.\"\r\n\r\nShip Construction didn't think that would take too long.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see to it that you get full information on the new submarine\r\ndetection system, Prince Trask,\" the admiral said.\r\n\r\n\"You gentlemen understand you'll have to keep it under your helmets,\r\nthough,\" one of the Intelligence men added. \"If it got out that we\r\nwere informing Space Vikings about our technical secrets....\" He\r\nfelt the back of his neck in a way that made Trask suspect that\r\nbeheadment was the customary form of execution on Marduk.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to find out where the fellow has his base,\" Operational\r\nPlanning said. \"I take it, Prince Trask, that you're not going to\r\nassume that he was on his flagship when you blew it, and just put\r\npaid to him and forget him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. I'm assuming that he wasn't. I don't believe he and Ormm\r\nwent anywhere on the same ship, after he came out here and\r\nestablished a base. I think one of them would stay home all the\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll give you everything we have on them,\" Shefter promised.\r\n\"Most of that is classified and you'll have to keep quiet about it,\r\ntoo. I just skimmed over the summary of what you gave us; I daresay\r\nwe'll both get a lot of new information. Have you any idea at all\r\nwhere he might be based, Prince Trask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that we think it's a non-Terra-type planet.\" He told them\r\nabout Dunnan's heavy purchases of air-and-water recycling equipment\r\nand carniculture and hydroponic material. \"That, of course, helps a\r\ngreat deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; there are only about five million planets in the former\r\nFederation space-volume that are inhabitable in artificial\r\nenvironment. Including a few completely covered by seas, where you\r\ncould put in underwater dome cities if you had the time and\r\nmaterial.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the Intelligence officers had been nursing a glass with a\r\ntiny remnant of cocktail in it. He downed it suddenly, filled the\r\nglass again, and glowered at it in silence for a while. Then he\r\ndrank it briskly and refilled it.\r\n\r\n\"What I should like to know,\" he said, \"is how this double obscenity\r\nof a Dunnan knew we'd have a ship on Audhumla just when we did,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Your talking about underwater dome-cities reminded me of it.\r\nI don't think he just pulled that planet out of a hat and then went\r\nthere prepared to sit on the bottom of the ocean for a year and a\r\nhalf waiting for something to turn up. I think he knew the\r\n_Victrix_ was coming to Audhumla, and just about when.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like that, commodore,\" Shefter said.\r\n\r\n\"You think I do, sir?\" the Intelligence officer countered. \"There it\r\nis, though. We all have to face it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do,\" Shefter agreed. \"Get on it, commodore, and I don't need to\r\ncaution you to screen everybody you put onto it very carefully.\" He\r\nlooked at his own glass; it had a bare thimbleful in the bottom. He\r\nreplenished it slowly and carefully. \"It's been a long time since\r\nthe Navy's had anything like this to worry about.\" He turned to\r\nTrask. \"I suppose I can get in touch with you at the Palace whenever\r\nI must?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Prince Trask and I have been invited as house-guests at\r\nPrince Edvard's, I mean Baron Cragdale's, hunting lodge,\" Bentrik\r\nsaid. \"We'll be going there directly from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah.\" Admiral Shefter smiled slightly. Beside not having three horns\r\nand a spiked tail, this Space Viking was definitely _persona grata_\r\nwith the Royal Family. \"Well, we'll keep in contact, Prince Trask.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hunting lodge where Crown Prince Edvard was simple Baron\r\nCragdale lay at the head of a sharply-sloping mountain valley down\r\nwhich a river tumbled. Mountains rose on either side in high scarps,\r\nsome topped with perpetual snow, glaciers curling down from them.\r\nThe lower ranges were forested, as was the valley between, and there\r\nwas a red-mauve alpenglow on the great peak that rose from the head\r\nof the valley. For the first time in over a year, Elaine was with\r\nhim, silently clinging to him to see the beauty of it through his\r\neyes. He had thought that she had gone from him forever.\r\n\r\nThe hunting lodge itself was not quite what a Sword-Worlder would\r\nexpect a hunting lodge to be. At first sight, from the air, it\r\nlooked like a sundial, a slender tower rising like a gnomen above a\r\ncircle of low buildings and formal gardens. The boat landed at the\r\nfoot of it, and he and Prince and Princess Bentrik and the young\r\nCount of Ravary and his tutor descended. Immediately, they were\r\nbeset by a flurry of servants; the second boat, with the Bentrik\r\nservants and their luggage, was circling in to land. Elaine, he\r\ndiscovered, wasn't with him any more, and then he was separated from\r\nthe Bentriks and was being floated up an inside shaft in a\r\nlifter-car. More servants installed him in his rooms, unpacked his\r\ncases, drew his bath and even tried to help him take it, and fussed\r\nover him while he dressed.\r\n\r\nThere were over a score for dinner. Bentrik had warned him that he'd\r\nfind some odd types; maybe he meant that they wouldn't all be\r\nnobles. Among the commoners there were some professors, mostly\r\nsocial sciences, a labor leader, a couple of Representatives and a\r\nmember of the Chamber of Delegates, and a couple of social workers,\r\nwhatever that meant.\r\n\r\nHis own table companion was a Lady Valerie Alvarath. She was\r\nbeautiful--black hair, and almost startlingly blue eyes, a\r\ncombination unusual in the Sword-Worlds--and she was intelligent,\r\nor at least cleverly articulate. She was introduced as the\r\nlady-companion of the Crown Prince's daughter. When he asked\r\nwhere the daughter was, she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"She won't be helping entertain visiting Space Vikings for a long\r\ntime, Prince Trask. She is precisely eight years old; I saw her\r\ngetting ready for bed before I came down here. I'll look in on her\r\nafter dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Crown Princess Melanie, on his other hand, asked him some\r\nquestion about Sword-World court etiquette. He stuck to\r\ngeneralities, and what he could remember from a presentation at the\r\ncourt of Excalibur during his student days. These people had a\r\nmonarchy since before Gram had been colonized; he wasn't going to\r\nadmit that Gram's had been established since he went off-planet.\r\nThe table was small enough for everybody to hear what he was saying\r\nand to feed questions to him. It lasted all through the meal, and\r\ncontinued when they adjourned for coffee in the library.\r\n\r\n\"But what about your form of government, your social structure,\r\nthat sort of thing?\" somebody, impatient with the artificialities\r\nof the court, wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we don't use the word government very much,\" he replied. \"We\r\ntalk a lot about authority and sovereignty, and I'm afraid we burn\r\nentirely too much powder over it, but government always seems to us\r\nlike sovereignty interfering in matters that don't concern it. As\r\nlong as sovereignty maintains a reasonable semblance of good public\r\norder and makes the more serious forms of crime fairly hazardous for\r\nthe criminals, we're satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's just negative. Doesn't the government do anything\r\npositive for the people?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to explain the Sword-World feudal system to them. It was\r\nhard, he found, to explain something you have taken for granted all\r\nyour life to somebody who is quite unfamiliar with it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"But the government--the sovereignty, since you don't like the other\r\nword--doesn't do anything for the people!\" one of the professors\r\nobjected. \"It leaves all the social services to the whim of the\r\nindividual lord or baron.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the people have no voice at all; why, that's tyranny,\"\r\na professor Assemblyman added.\r\n\r\nHe tried to explain that the people had a very distinct and\r\ncommanding voice, and that barons and lords who wanted to stay\r\nalive listened attentively to it. The Assemblyman changed his mind;\r\nthat wasn't tyranny, it was anarchy. And the professor was still\r\ninsistent about who performed the social services.\r\n\r\n\"If you mean schools and hospitals and keeping the city clean, the\r\npeople do that for themselves. The government, if you want to think\r\nof it as that, just sees to it that nobody's shooting at them while\r\nthey're doing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't what Professor Pullwell means, Lucas. He means old-age\r\npensions,\" Prince Bentrik said. \"Like this thing Zaspar Makann's\r\nwhooping for.\"\r\n\r\nHe'd heard about that, on the voyage from Audhumla. Every person on\r\nMarduk would be retired on an adequate pension after thirty years\r\nregular employment or at the age of sixty. When he had wanted to\r\nknow where the money would come from, he had been told that there\r\nwould be a sales tax, and that the pensions must all be spent within\r\nthirty days, which would stimulate business, and the increased\r\nbusiness would provide tax money to pay the pensions.\r\n\r\n\"We have a joke about three Gilgameshers space-wrecked on an\r\nuninhabited planet,\" he said. \"Ten years later, when they were\r\nrescued, all three were immensely wealthy, from trading hats with\r\neach other. That's about the way this thing will work.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the lady social workers bristled; it wasn't right to make\r\nderogatory jokes about racial groups. One of the professors\r\nharrumphed; wasn't a parallel at all, the Self-Sustaining Rotary\r\nPension Plan was perfectly feasible. With a shock, Trask recalled\r\nthat he was a professor of economics.\r\n\r\nAlvyn Karffard wouldn't need any twenty ships to loot Marduk. Just\r\ninfiltrate it with about a hundred smart confidence men and inside\r\na year they'd own everything on it.\r\n\r\nThat started them all off on Zaspar Makann, though. Some of them\r\nthought he had a few good ideas, but was damaging his own case by\r\nextremism. One of the wealthier nobles said that he was a reproach\r\nto the ruling class; it was their fault that people like Makann\r\ncould gain a following. One old gentleman said that maybe the\r\nGilgameshers were to blame, themselves, for some of the animosity\r\ntoward them. He was immediately set upon by all the others and\r\nverbally torn to pieces on the spot.\r\n\r\nTrask didn't feel it proper to quote Goodman Mikhyl to this crowd.\r\nHe took the responsibility upon himself for saying:\r\n\r\n\"From what I've heard of him, I think he's the most serious threat\r\nto civilized society on Marduk.\"\r\n\r\nThey didn't call him crazy, after all he was a guest, but they\r\ndidn't ask him what he meant, either. They merely told him that\r\nMakann was a crackpot with a contemptible following of half-wits,\r\nand just wait till the election and see what happened.\r\n\r\n\"I'm inclined to agree with Prince Trask,\" Bentrik said soberly.\r\n\"And I'm afraid the election results will be a shock to us, not to\r\nMakann.\"\r\n\r\nHe hadn't talked that way on the ship. Maybe he'd been looking\r\naround and doing some thinking, since he got back. He might have\r\nbeen talking to Goodman Mikhyl, too. There was a screen in the room.\r\nHe nodded toward it.\r\n\r\n\"He's speaking at a rally of the People's Welfare Party at Drepplin,\r\nnow,\" he said. \"May I put it on, to show you what I mean?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Crown Prince assented, he snapped on the screen and\r\ntwiddled at the selector.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA face looked out of it. The features weren't Andray Dunnan's--the\r\nmouth was wider, the cheekbones broader, the chin more rounded. But\r\nhis eyes were Dunnan's, as Trask had seen them on the terrace of\r\nKarvall House. Mad eyes. His high-pitched voice screamed:\r\n\r\n\"Our beloved sovereign is a prisoner! He is surrounded by traitors!\r\nThe Ministries are full of them! They are all traitors! The\r\nbloodthirsty reactionaries of the falsely so-called Crown Loyalist\r\nParty! The grasping conspiracy of the interstellar bankers! The\r\ndirty Gilgameshers! They are all leagued together in an unholy\r\nconspiracy! And now this Space Viking, this bloody-handed monster\r\nfrom the Sword-Worlds....\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut the horrible man off,\" somebody was yelling, in competition\r\nwith the hypnotic scream of the speaker.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was, they couldn't. They could turn off the screen, but\r\nZaspar Makann would go on screaming, and millions all over the\r\nplanet would still hear him. Bentrik twiddled the selector. The\r\nvoice stuttered briefly, and then came echoing out of the speaker,\r\nbut this time the pickup was somewhere several hundred feet above\r\na great open park. It was densely packed with people, most of them\r\nwearing clothes a farm tramp on Gram wouldn't be found dead in,\r\nbut here and there among them were blocks of men in what was\r\nalmost but not quite military uniform, each with a short and thick\r\nswagger-stick with a knobbed head. Across the park, in the distance,\r\nthe head and shoulders of Zaspar Makann loomed a hundred feet high\r\nin a huge screen. Whenever he stopped for breath, a shout would go\r\nup, beginning with the blocks of uniformed men:\r\n\r\n\"_Makann! Makann! Makann the Leader! Makann to Power!_\"\r\n\r\n\"You even let him have a private army?\" he asked the Crown Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, those silly buffoons and their musical-comedy uniforms,\"\r\nthe Crown Prince shrugged. \"They aren't armed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not visibly,\" he granted. \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know where they'd get arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Your Highness,\" Prince Bentrik said. \"Neither do I.\r\nThat's what I'm worried about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe succeeded, the next morning, in convincing everybody that he\r\nwanted to be alone for a while, and was sitting in a garden,\r\nwatching the rainbows in the midst of a big waterfall across the\r\nvalley. Elaine would have liked that, but she wasn't with him, now.\r\n\r\nThen he realized that somebody was speaking to him, in a small,\r\nbashful voice. He turned, and saw a little girl in shorts and a\r\nsleeveless jacket, holding in her arms a long-haired blond puppy\r\nwith big ears and appealing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, both of you,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe puppy wriggled and tried to lick the girl's face.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Mopsy. We want to talk to this gentleman,\" she said.\r\n\"Are you really and truly the Space Viking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really and truly. And who are you two?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm Myrna. And this is Mopsy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Myrna. Hello, Mopsy.\"\r\n\r\nHearing his name, the puppy wriggled again and dropped from the\r\nchild's arms; after a brief hesitation, he came over and jumped onto\r\nTrask's lap, licking his face. While he petted the dog, the girl\r\ncame over and sat on the bench beside him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Mopsy likes you,\" she said. After a moment, she added: \"I like you, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I like you,\" he said. \"Would you want to be my girl? You know,\r\na Space Viking has to have a girl on every planet. How would you\r\nlike to be my girl on Marduk?\"\r\n\r\nMyrna thought that over carefully. \"I'd like to, but I couldn't.\r\nYou see, I'm going to have to be Queen, some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Grandpa is King now, and when he's through being King, Pappa\r\nwill have to be King, and then when he's through being King, I can't\r\nbe King because I'm a girl, so I'll have to be Queen. And I can't be\r\nanybody's girl, because I'm going to have to marry somebody I don't\r\nknow, for reasons of state.\" She thought some more, and lowered her\r\nvoice. \"I'll tell you a secret. I am a Queen now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"We are Queen, in our own right, of our Royal Bedroom,\r\nour Royal Playroom, and our Royal Bathroom. And Mopsy is our\r\nfaithful subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Your Majesty absolute ruler of these domains?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said disgustedly. \"We must at all times defer to our Royal\r\nMinisters, just like Grandpa has to. That means, I have to do just\r\nwhat they tell me to. That's Lady Valerie, and Margot, and Dame Eunice,\r\nand Sir Thomas. But Grandpa says they are good and wise ministers.\r\nAre you really a Prince? I didn't know Space Vikings were Princes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my King says I am. And I am ruler of my planet, and I'll tell\r\nyou a secret. I don't have to do what anybody tells me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee! Are you a tyrant? You're awfully big and strong. I'll bet\r\nyou've slain just hundreds of cruel and wicked enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thousands, Your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nHe wished that weren't literally true; he didn't know how many of\r\nthem had been little girls like Myrna and little dogs like Mopsy. He\r\nfound that he was holding both of them tightly. The girl was saying:\r\n\"But you feel bad about it.\" These children must be telepaths!\r\n\r\n\"A Space Viking who is also a Prince must do many things he doesn't\r\nwant to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. So does a Queen. I hope Grandpa and Pappa don't get through\r\nbeing King for just years and years.\" She looked over his shoulder.\r\n\"Oh! And now I suppose I've got to do something else I don't want to.\r\nLessons, I bet.\"\r\n\r\nHe followed her eyes. The girl who had been his dinner companion was\r\napproaching; she wore a wide sunshade hat, and a gown that trailed\r\nfilmy gauze like sunset-colored mist. There was another woman, in\r\nthe garb of an upper servant, with her.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Valerie and who else?\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Margot. She's my nurse. She's awful strict, but she's nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince Trask, has Her Highness been bothering you?\" Lady Valerie asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, far from it.\" He rose, still holding the funny little dog.\r\n\"But you should say, Her Majesty. She has informed me that she\r\nis sovereign of three princely domains. And of one dear loving\r\nsubject.\" He gave the subject back to the sovereign.\r\n\r\n\"You should not have told Prince Trask that,\" Lady Valerie chided.\r\n\"When Your Majesty is outside her domains, Your Majesty must remain\r\nincognito. Now, Your Majesty must go with the Minister of the\r\nBedchamber; the Minister of Education awaits an audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arithmetic, I bet. Well, good-by, Prince Trask. I hope I can see\r\nyou again. Say good-by, Mopsy.\"\r\n\r\nShe went away with her nurse, the little dog looking back over her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I came out to enjoy the gardens alone,\" he said, \"and now I find\r\nI'd rather enjoy them in company. If your Ministerial duties do not\r\nforbid, could you be the company?\"\r\n\r\n\"But gladly, Prince Trask. Her Majesty will be occupied with serious\r\naffairs of state. Square root. Have you seen the grottoes? They're\r\ndown this way.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, one of the gentlemen-attendants caught up with him;\r\nBaron Cragdale would be gratified if Prince Trask could find time to\r\ntalk with him privately. Before they had talked more than a few\r\nminutes, however, Baron Cragdale abruptly became Crown Prince Edvard.\r\n\r\n\"Prince Trask, Admiral Shefter tells me that you and he are having\r\ninformal discussions about co-operation against this mutual enemy\r\nof ours, Dunnan. This is fine; it has my approval, and the approval\r\nof Prince Vandarvant, the Prime Minister, and, I might add, that of\r\nGoodman Mikhyl. I think it ought to go further, though. A formal treaty\r\nbetween Tanith and Marduk would be greatly to the advantage of both.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd be inclined to think so, Prince Edvard. But aren't you\r\nproposing marriage on rather short acquaintance? It's only been\r\nfifty hours since the _Nemesis_ orbited in here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we know a bit about you and your planet beforehand. There's\r\na large Gilgamesher colony here. You have a few on Tanith, haven't\r\nyou? Well, anything one Gilgamesher knows, they all find out, and\r\nours are co-operative with Naval intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nThat would be why Andray Dunnan was having no dealings with\r\nGilgameshers. It would also be what Zaspar Makann meant when\r\nhe ranted about the Gilgamesh Interstellar Conspiracy.\r\n\r\n\"I can see where an arrangement like that would be mutually\r\nadvantageous. I'd be quite in favor of it. Co-operation against\r\nDunnan, of course, and reciprocal trade-rights on each other's\r\ntrade-planets, and direct trade between Marduk and Tanith. And\r\nBeowulf and Amaterasu would come into it, too. Does this also have\r\nthe approval of the Prime Minister and the King?\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodman Mikhyl's in favor of it; there's a distinction between him\r\nand the King, as you'll have noticed. The King can't be in favor of\r\nanything till the Assembly or the Chancellor express an opinion.\r\nPrince Vandarvant favors it personally; as Prime Minister, he is\r\nreserving his opinion. We'll have to get the support of the Crown\r\nLoyalist Party before he can take an unequivocal position.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Baron Cragdale; speaking as Baron Trask of Traskon, suppose\r\nwe just work out a rough outline of what this treaty ought to be,\r\nand then consult, unofficially, with a few people whom you can\r\ntrust, and see what can be done about presenting it to the proper\r\ngovernment officials....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister came to Cragdale that evening, heavily incognito\r\nand accompanied by several leaders of the Crown Loyalist Party. In\r\nprinciple, they all favored a treaty with Tanith. Politically, they\r\nhad doubts. Not before the election; too controversial a subject.\r\n\"Controversial,\" it appeared, was the dirtiest dirty-name anything\r\ncould be called on Marduk. It would alienate the labor vote; they'd\r\nthink increased imports would threaten employment in Mardukan\r\nindustries. Some of the interstellar trading companies would like\r\na chance at the Tanith planets; others would resent Tanith ships\r\nbeing given access to theirs. And Zaspar Makann's party were already\r\nshrieking protests about the _Nemesis_ being repaired by the\r\nRoyal Navy.\r\n\r\nAnd a couple of professors who inclined toward Makann had introduced\r\na resolution calling for the court-martial of Prince Bentrik and an\r\ninvestigation of the loyalty of Admiral Shefter. And somebody else,\r\nprobably a stooge of Makann's, was claiming that Bentrik had sold\r\nthe _Victrix_ to the Space Vikings and that the films of the battle of\r\nAudhumla were fakes, photographed in miniature at the Navy Moon Base.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Shefter, when Trask flew in to see him the next day, was\r\ncontemptuous about this last.\r\n\r\n\"Ignore the whole bloody thing; we get something like that before\r\nevery general election. On this planet, you can always kick the\r\nGilgameshers and the Armed Forces with impunity, neither have votes\r\nand neither can kick back. The whole thing'll be forgotten the day\r\nafter the election. It always is.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's if Makann doesn't win the election,\" Trask qualified.\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter who wins the election. They can't any of them\r\nget along without the Navy, and they bloody well know it.\"\r\n\r\nTrask wanted to know if Intelligence had been getting anything.\r\n\r\n\"Not on how Dunnan found out the _Victrix_ had been ordered to\r\nAudhumla, no,\" Shefter said. \"There wasn't any secrecy about it;\r\nat least a thousand people, from myself down to the shoeshine boys,\r\ncould have known about it as soon as the order was taped.\r\n\r\n\"As for the list of ships you gave me, yes. One of them puts in\r\nto this planet regularly; she spaced out from here only yesterday\r\nmorning. The _Honest Horris_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, great Satan, haven't you done anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know if there's anything we can do. Oh, we're investigating,\r\nbut.... You see, this ship first showed up here four years ago,\r\ncommanded by some kind of a Neobarb, not a Gilgamesher, named Horris\r\nSasstroff. He claimed to be from Skathi; the locals there have a few\r\nships, the Space Vikings had a base on Skathi about a hundred or so\r\nyears ago. Naturally, the ship had no papers. Tramp trading among\r\nthe Neobarbs, it might be years before you'd put in on a planet where\r\nthey'd ever heard of ship's papers.\r\n\r\n\"The ship seems to have been in bad shape, probably abandoned on\r\nSkathi as junk a century ago and tinkered up by the locals. She was\r\nin here twice, according to the commercial shipping records, and the\r\nsecond time she was in too bad shape to be moved out, and Sasstroff\r\ncouldn't pay to have her rebuilt, so she was libeled for spaceport\r\ncharges and sold. Some one-lung trading company bought her and fixed\r\nher up a little; they went bankrupt in a year or so, and she was\r\nbought by another small company, Startraders, Ltd., and they've been\r\nusing her on a milk-run to and from Gimli. They seem to be a\r\nlegitimate outfit, but we're looking into them. We're looking for\r\nSasstroff, too, but we haven't been able to find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have a ship out Gimli way, you might find out if anybody\r\nthere knows anything about her. You may discover that she hasn't\r\nbeen going there at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might, at that,\" Shefter agreed. \"We'll just find out.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverybody at Cragdale knew about the projected treaty with Tanith\r\nby the morning after Trask's first conversation with Prince Edvard\r\non the subject. The Queen of the Royal Bedroom, the Royal Playroom\r\nand the Royal Bathroom was insisting that her domains should have\r\na treaty with Tanith, too.\r\n\r\nIt was beginning to look to Trask as though that would be the only\r\ntreaty he'd sign on Marduk, and he was having his doubts about that.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it would be wise?\" he asked Lady Valerie Alvarath.\r\nThe Queen of three rooms and one four-footed subject had already\r\ndecreed that Lady Valerie should be the Space Viking Prince's girl\r\non the planet of Marduk. \"If it got out, these People's Welfare\r\nlunatics would pick it up and twist it into evidence of some kind\r\nof a sinister plot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I believe Her Majesty could sign a treaty with Prince Trask,\"\r\nHer Majesty's Prime Minister decided. \"But it would have to be kept\r\nvery secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee!\" Myrna's eyes widened. \"A real secret treaty; just like the\r\nwicked rulers of the old dictatorship!\" She hugged her subject\r\necstatically. \"I'll bet Grandpa doesn't even have any secret treaties!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a few days, everybody on Marduk knew that a treaty with Tanith\r\nwas being discussed. If they didn't, it was no fault of Zaspar\r\nMakann's party, who seemed to command a disconcertingly large number\r\nof telecast stations, and who drenched the ether with horror stories\r\nof Space Viking atrocities and denunciations of carefully unnamed\r\ntraitors surrounding the King and the Crown Prince who were about to\r\nbetray Marduk to rapine and plunder. The leak evidently did not come\r\nfrom Cragdale, for it was generally believed that Trask was still at\r\nthe Royal Palace in Malverton. At least, that was where the\r\nMakannists were demonstrating against him.\r\n\r\nHe watched such a demonstration by screen; the pickup was evidently\r\non one of the landing stages of the palace, overlooking the wide\r\nparks surrounding it. They were packed almost solid with people,\r\nsurging forward toward the thin cordon of police. The front of the\r\nmob looked like a checkerboard--a block in civilian dress, then a\r\nblock in the curiously effeminate-looking uniforms of Zaspar\r\nMakann's People's Watchmen, then more in ordinary garb, and more\r\nPeople's Watchmen. Over the heads of the crowds, at intervals,\r\nfloated small contragravity lifters on which were mounted the\r\namplifiers that were bellowing:\r\n\r\n\"SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME! SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME!\"\r\n\r\nThe police stood motionless, at parade rest; the mob surged closer.\r\nWhen they were fifty yards away, the blocks of People's Watchmen ran\r\nforward, then spread out until they formed a line six deep across\r\nthe entire front; other blocks, from the rear, pushed the ordinary\r\ndemonstrators aside and took their place. Hating them more every\r\nsecond, Trask grudged approval of a smart and disciplined maneuver.\r\nHow long, he wondered, had they been drilling in that sort of\r\ntactics? Without stopping, they continued their advance on the\r\npolice, who had now shifted their stance.\r\n\r\n\"SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME! SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" he heard himself yelling. \"Don't let them get any closer,\r\nfire now!\"\r\n\r\nThey had nothing to fire with; they had only truncheons, no better\r\nweapons than the knobbed swagger-sticks of the People's Watchmen.\r\nThey simply disappeared, after a brief flurry of blows, and the\r\nMakann storm-troopers continued their advance.\r\n\r\nAnd that was that. The gates of the Palace were shut; the mob,\r\nbehind a front of Makann People's Watchmen, surged up to them and\r\nstopped. The loud-speakers bellowed on, reiterating their four-word\r\nchant.\r\n\r\n\"Those police were murdered,\" he said. \"They were murdered by the\r\nman who ordered them out there unarmed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be Count Naydnayr, the Minister of Security,\" somebody said.\r\n\r\n\"Then he's the one you want to hang for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else would you have done?\" Crown Prince Edvard challenged.\r\n\r\n\"Put up about fifty combat cars. Drawn a deadline, and opened\r\nmachine-gun fire as soon as the mob crossed it, and kept on firing\r\ntill the survivors turned tail and ran. Then sent out more cars, and\r\nshot everybody wearing a People's Watchmen uniform, all over town.\r\nInside forty-eight hours, there'd be no People's Welfare party, and\r\nno Zaspar Makann either.\"\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince's face stiffened. \"That may be the way you do\r\nthings in the Sword-Worlds, Prince Trask. It's not the way we do\r\nthings here on Marduk. Our government does not propose to be guilty\r\nof shedding the blood of its people.\"\r\n\r\nHe had it on the tip of his tongue to retort that if they didn't,\r\nthe people would end by shedding theirs. Instead, he said softly:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Prince Edvard. You had a wonderful civilization here on\r\nMarduk. You could have made almost anything of it. But it's too late\r\nnow. You've torn down the gates; the barbarians are in.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration][Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colored turbulence faded into the gray of hyperspace;\r\nfive hundred hours to Tanith. Guatt Kirbey was securing his\r\ncontrol-panel, happy to return to his music. And Vann Larch would go\r\nback to his paints and brushes, and Alvyn Karffard to the working\r\nmodel of whatever it was he had left unfinished when the _Nemesis_\r\nhad emerged at the end of the jump from Audhumla.\r\n\r\nTrask went to the index of the ship's library and punched for\r\n_History, Old Terran_. There was plenty of that, thanks to Otto\r\nHarkaman. Then he punched for _Hitler, Adolf_. Harkaman was right;\r\nanything that could happen in a human society had already happened,\r\nin one form or another, somewhere and at some time. Hitler could\r\nhelp him understand Zaspar Makann.\r\n\r\nBy the time the ship came out, with the yellow sun of Tanith\r\nin the middle of the screen, he knew a great deal about Hitler,\r\noccasionally referred to as Schicklgruber, and he understood, with\r\nsorrow, how the lights of civilization on Marduk were going out.\r\n\r\nBeside the _Lamia_, stripped of her Dillinghams and crammed with\r\nheavy armament and detection instruments, the _Space Scourge_ and\r\nthe _Queen Flavia_ were on off-planet watch. There were half a dozen\r\nother ships on orbit just above atmosphere; a Gilgamesher, one of\r\nthe Gram-Tanith freighters, a couple of free-lance Space Vikings,\r\nand a new and unfamiliar ship. When he asked the moonbase who she\r\nwas, he was told that she was the _Sun Goddess_, Amaterasu. That\r\nwas, by almost a year, better than he had expected of them. Otto\r\nHarkaman was out in the _Corisande_, raiding and visiting the\r\ntrade-planets.\r\n\r\nHe found his cousin, Nikkolay Trask, at Rivington; when he inquired\r\nabout Traskon, Nikkolay cursed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about Traskon; I haven't anything to do with\r\nTraskon, any more. Traskon is now the personal property of our well\r\nloved--very well loved--Queen Evita. The Trasks don't own enough\r\nland on Gram now for a family cemetery. You see what you did?\" he\r\nadded bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't rub it in, Nikkolay. If I'd stayed on Gram, I'd have\r\nhelped put Angus on the throne, and it would have been about the\r\nsame in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could be a lot different,\" Nikkolay said. \"You could bring\r\nyour ships and men back to Gram and put yourself on the throne.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I'll never go back to Gram. Tanith's my planet, now. But I will\r\nrenounce my allegiance to Angus. I can trade on Morglay or Joyeuse\r\nor Flamberge just as easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't have to; you can trade with Newhaven and Bigglersport.\r\nCount Lionel and Duke Joris are both defying Angus; they've refused\r\nto furnish him men, they've driven out his tax collectors, those\r\nthey haven't hanged, and they're building ships of their own. Angus\r\nis building ships, too. I don't know whether he's going to use them\r\nto fight Bigglersport and Newhaven, or attack you, but there's going\r\nto be a war before another year's out.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Goodhope_ and the _Speedwell_, he found, had gone back to Gram.\r\nThey were commanded by men who had come into favor at the court of\r\nKing Angus recently. The _Black Star_ and the _Queen Flavia_--whose\r\ncaptain had contemptuously ignored an order from Gram to re-christen\r\nher _Queen Evita_--had remained. They were his ships, not King\r\nAngus'. The captain of the merchantman from Wardshaven now on orbit\r\nrefused to take a cargo to Newhaven; he had been chartered by King\r\nAngus, and would take orders from no one else.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Trask told him. \"This is your last voyage here. You\r\nbring that ship back under Angus of Wardshaven's charter and we'll\r\nfire on her.\"\r\n\r\nThen he had the regalia he had worn in his last audiovisual to\r\nAngus dusted off. At first, he had decided to proclaim himself\r\nKing of Tanith. Lord Valpry, Baron Rathmore and his cousin all\r\nadvised against it.\r\n\r\n\"Just call yourself Prince of Tanith,\" Valpry said. \"The title won't\r\nmake any difference in your authority here, and if you do lay claim\r\nto the throne of Gram, nobody can say you're a foreign king trying\r\nto annex the planet.\"\r\n\r\nHe had no intention of doing anything of the kind, but Valpry was\r\nquite in earnest.\r\n\r\nSo he sat on his throne, as sovereign Prince of Tanith, and\r\nrenounced his allegiance to \"Angus, Duke of Wardshaven, self-styled\r\nKing of Gram.\" They sent it back on the otherwise empty freighter.\r\nAnother copy went to the Count of Newhaven, along with a cargo in\r\nthe _Sun Goddess_, the first non-Space-Viking ship into Gram from\r\nthe Old Federation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeven hundred and fifty hours after the return of the _Nemesis_,\r\nthe _Corisande II_ emerged from her last microjump, and immediately\r\nHarkaman began hearing of the Battle of Audhumla and the destruction\r\nof the _Yo-Yo_ and the _Enterprise_. At first, he merely reported a\r\nsuccessful raiding voyage, from which he was bringing rich booty.\r\nOddly varigated booty, it was remarked, when he began itemizing it.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" he replied. \"Secondhand booty. I raided Dagon for it.\"\r\n\r\nDagon was a Space Viking base planet, occupied by a character named\r\nFedrig Barragon. A number of ships operated from it, including a\r\ncouple commanded by Barragon's half-breed sons.\r\n\r\n\"Barragon's ships were raiding one of our planets,\" Harkaman said.\r\n\"Ganpat. They looted a couple of cities, destroyed one, killed a lot\r\nof the locals. I found out about it from Captain Ravallo of the\r\n_Black Star_, on Indra; he'd just been from Ganpat. Beowulf wasn't\r\ntoo far out of the way, so we put in there, and found the\r\n_Grendelsbane_ just ready to space out.\" The _Grendelsbane_ was the\r\nsecond of Beowulf's ships, sister to the _Viking's Gift_. \"So she\r\njoined us, and the three of us went to Dagon. We blew up one of\r\nBarragon's ships, and put the other one down out of commission, and\r\nthen we sacked his base. There was a Gilgamesher colony there; we\r\ndidn't bother them. They'll tell what we did, and why.\"\r\n\r\n\"That should furnish Prince Viktor of Xochitl something to ponder,\"\r\nTrask said. \"Where are the other ships, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Grendelsbane_ went back to Beowulf; she'll stop at Amaterasu\r\nto do a little trading on the way. The _Black Star_ went to Xochitl.\r\nJust a friendly visit, to say hello to Prince Viktor for you.\r\nRavallo has a lot of audiovisuals we made during the Dagon\r\nOperation. Then she's going to Jagannath to visit Nikky Gratham.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkaman approved his attitude and actions with regard to King Angus.\r\n\r\n\"We don't need to do business with the Sword-Worlds at all. We have\r\nour own industries, we can produce what we need, and we can trade\r\nwith Beowulf and Amaterasu, and with Xochitl and Jagannath and Hoth,\r\nif we can make any sort of agreement with them; everybody agrees to\r\nlet everybody else's trade-planets alone. It's too bad you couldn't\r\nget some kind of an agreement with Marduk.\" Harkaman regretted that\r\nfor a few seconds, and then shrugged. \"Our grandchildren, if any,\r\nwill probably be raiding Marduk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think it'll be like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you? You were there; you saw what's happening. The barbarians\r\nare rising; they have a leader, and they're uniting. Every society\r\nrests on a barbarian base. The people who don't understand\r\ncivilization, and wouldn't like it if they did. The hitchhikers.\r\nThe people who create nothing, and who don't appreciate what others\r\nhave created for them, and who think civilization is something that\r\njust exists and that all they need to do is enjoy what they can\r\nunderstand of it--luxuries, a high living standard, and easy work\r\nfor high pay. Responsibilities? Phooey! What do they have\r\na government for?\"\r\n\r\nTrask nodded. \"And now, the hitchhikers think they know more about\r\nthe car than the people who designed it, so they're going to grab\r\nthe controls. Zaspar Makann says they can, and he's the Leader.\" He\r\npoured a drink from a decanter that had been looted on Pushan; there\r\nwas a planet where a republic had been overthrown in favor of a\r\ndictatorship four centuries ago, and the planetary dictatorship had\r\nfissioned into a dozen regional dictatorships, and now they were\r\ndown to the peasant-village and handcraft-industry level. \"I don't\r\nunderstand it, though. I was reading about Hitler, on the way home.\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if Zaspar Makann had been reading about\r\nHitler, too. He's using all Hitler's tricks. But Hitler came to\r\npower in a country which had been impoverished by a military defeat.\r\nMarduk hasn't fought a war in almost two generations, and that one\r\nwas a farce.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't the war that put Hitler into power. It was the fact that\r\nthe ruling class of his nation, the people who kept things running,\r\nwere discredited. The masses, the homemade barbarians, didn't have\r\nanybody to take their responsibilities for them. What they have on\r\nMarduk is a ruling class that has been discrediting itself. A ruling\r\nclass that's ashamed of its privileges and shirks its duties. A\r\nruling class that has begun to believe that the masses are just as\r\ngood as they are, which they manifestly are not. And a ruling class\r\nthat won't use force to maintain its position. And they have a\r\ndemocracy, and they are letting the enemies of democracy shelter\r\nthemselves behind democratic safeguards.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't have any of this democracy in the Sword-Worlds, if that's\r\nthe word for it,\" he said. \"And our ruling class aren't ashamed of\r\ntheir power, and our people aren't hitchhikers, and as long as they\r\nget decent treatment they don't try to run things. And we're not\r\ndoing so well.\"\r\n\r\nThe Morglay dynastic war of a couple of centuries ago, still\r\nsputtering and smoking. The Oskarsan-Elmersan War on Durendal, into\r\nwhich Flamberge and now Joyeuse had intruded. And the situation on\r\nGram, fast approaching critical mass. Harkaman nodded agreement.\r\n\r\n\"You know why? Our rulers are the barbarians among us. There isn't\r\none of them--Napolyon of Flamberge, Rodolf of Excalibur, or Angus of\r\nabout half of Gram--who is devoted to civilization or anything else\r\noutside himself, and that's the mark of the barbarian.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you devoted to, Otto?\"\r\n\r\n\"You. You are my chieftain. That's another mark of the barbarian.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore he had left Marduk, Admiral Shefter had ordered a ship to\r\nGimli to check on the _Honest Horris_; a few men and a pinnace would\r\nbe left behind to contact any ship from Tanith. He sent Boake\r\nValkanhayn off in the _Space Scourge_.\r\n\r\nLionel of Newhaven's _Blue Comet_ came in from Gram with a cargo of\r\ngeneral merchandise. Her captain wanted fissionables and gadolinium;\r\nCount Lionel was building more ships. There was a rumor that Omfray\r\nof Glaspyth was laying claim to the throne of Gram, in the right\r\nof his great-grandmother's sister, who had been married to the\r\ngreat-grandfather of Duke Angus. It was a completely trivial and\r\nirrelevant claim, but the story was that it would be supported\r\nby King Konrad of Haulteclere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nImmediately, Baron Rathmore, Lord Valpry, Lothar Ffayle and the other\r\nGram people began clamoring that he should go back with a fleet and\r\nseize the throne for himself. Harkaman, Valkanhayn, Karffard and the\r\nother Space Vikings were as vehement against it. Harkaman had the\r\nloss of the other _Corisande_ on Durendal to remember, and the others\r\nwanted no part in Sword-World squabbles, and there was renewed\r\nagitation that he should start calling himself King of Tanith.\r\n\r\nHe refused to do either, which left both parties dissatisfied. So\r\npartisan politics had finally come to Tanith. Maybe that was another\r\nmilestone of progress.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the Treaty of Khepera, between the Princely State of\r\nTanith, the Commonwealth of Beowulf, and the Planetary League of\r\nAmaterasu. The Kheperans agreed to allow bases on their planet, to\r\nfurnish workers, and to send students to school on all three planets.\r\nTanith, Beowulf and Amaterasu obligated themselves to joint defense\r\nof Khepera, to free trade among themselves, and to render one another\r\narmed assistance.\r\n\r\nThat _was_ a milestone of progress, and no argument about it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Space Scourge_ returned from Gimli, and Valkanhayn reported\r\nthat nobody on the planet had ever seen or heard of the _Honest\r\nHorris_. They had found a Mardukan Navy ship's pinnace there, manned\r\nentirely by officers, some of them Navy Intelligence. According to\r\nthem, the investigation into the activities of that ship had come to\r\nan impasse. The ostensible owners claimed, and had papers to prove\r\nit, that they had chartered her to a private trader, and he claimed,\r\nand had papers to prove it, that he was a citizen of the Planetary\r\nRepublic of Aton, and as soon as they began questioning him, he was\r\nrescued by the Atonian ambassador, who lodged a vehement protest\r\nwith the Mardukan Foreign Ministry. Immediately, the People's\r\nWelfare Party had leaped into the incident and branded the\r\ninvestigation as an unwarranted persecution of a national of a\r\nfriendly power at the instigation of corrupt tools of the Gilgamesh\r\nInterstellar Conspiracy.\r\n\r\n\"So that's it,\" Valkanhayn finished. \"It seems they're having an\r\nelection and they're afraid to antagonize anybody who might have a\r\nvote. So the Navy had to drop the investigation. Everybody on\r\nMarduk's scared of this Makann. You think there might be some tie-up\r\nbetween him and Dunnan?\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea's occurred to me. Have there been any more raids on Marduk\r\ntrade-planets since the Battle of Audhumla?\"\r\n\r\n\"A couple. The _Bolide_ was on Audhumla a while ago. There were a\r\ncouple of Mardukan ships there, and they had the _Victrix_ fixed up\r\nenough to do some fighting. They ran the _Bolide_ out.\"\r\n\r\nA study of the time between the destruction of the _Enterprise_\r\nand _Yo-Yo_ and the appearance of the _Bolide_ could give them a\r\nlimiting radius around Audhumla. It did; seven hundred light-years,\r\nwhich also included Tanith.\r\n\r\nSo he sent Harkaman in the _Corisande_ and Ravallo in the _Black\r\nStar_ to visit the planets Marduk traded with, looking for Dunnan\r\nships and exchanging information and assistance with the Royal\r\nMardukan Navy. Almost at once, he regretted it; the next Gilgamesher\r\ninto orbit on Tanith brought a story that Prince Viktor was\r\ncollecting a fleet on Xochitl. He sent warnings off to Amaterasu\r\nand Beowulf and Khepera.\r\n\r\nA ship came in from Bigglersport, a heavily armed chartered\r\nfreighter. There was sporadic fighting in a dozen places on Gram,\r\nnow--resistance to efforts on the part of King Angus to collect\r\ntaxes, and raids by unidentified persons on estates confiscated\r\nfrom alleged traitors and given to Garvan Spasso, who had now\r\nbeen promoted from Baron to Count. And Rovard Grauffis was dead;\r\npoisoned, everybody said, either by Spasso or Queen Evita or both.\r\nEven with the threat from Xochitl, some of the former Wardshaven\r\nnobles began talking about sending ships to Gram.\r\n\r\nLess than a thousand hours after he had left, Ravallo was back\r\nin the _Black Star_.\r\n\r\n\"I went to Gimli, and I wasn't there fifty hours before a\r\nMardukan Navy ship came in. They were glad to see me; it saved\r\nthem sending off a pinnace for Tanith. They had news for you, and\r\na couple of passengers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Passengers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You'll see who they are when they come down. And don't let\r\nanybody with side-whiskers and buttoned-up coats see them,\" Ravallo\r\nsaid. \"What those people know gets all over the place before long.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe visitors were Lucile, Princess Bentrik, and her son, the young\r\nCount of Ravary. They dined with Trask; only Captain Ravallo was\r\nalso present.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to leave my husband, and I didn't want to come here\r\nand impose myself and Steven on you, Prince Trask,\" she began, \"but\r\nhe insisted. We spent the whole voyage to Gimli concealed in the\r\ncaptain's quarters; only a few of the officers knew we were aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Makann won the election. Is that it?\" he asked. \"And Prince Bentrik\r\ndoesn't want to risk you and Steven being used as hostages?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" she said. \"He didn't really win the election, but he\r\nmight as well have. Nobody has a majority of seats in the Chamber of\r\nRepresentatives but he's formed a coalition with several of the\r\nsplinter parties, and I'm ashamed to say that a number of Crown\r\nLoyalist members--Crowd of Disloyalists, I call them--are voting\r\nwith him, now. They've coined some ridiculous phrase about the 'wave\r\nof the future,' whatever that means.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can't lick them, join them,\" Trask said.\r\n\r\n\"If you can't lick them, lick their boots,\" the Count of Ravary put in.\r\n\r\n\"My son is a trifle bitter,\" Princess Bentrik said. \"I must confess\r\nto a trace of bitterness, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's the Representatives,\" Trask said. \"What about the rest\r\nof the government?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the splinter-party and Disloyalist support, they got a\r\nmajority of seats in the Delegates. Most of them would have\r\nindignantly denied, a month before, having any connection with\r\nMakann, but a hundred out of a hundred and twenty are his\r\nsupporters. Makann, of course, is Chancellor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is Prime Minister?\" he asked. \"Andray Dunnan?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked slightly baffled for an instant then said, \"Oh. No.\r\nThe Prime Minister is Crown Prince Edvard. No; Baron Cragdale.\r\nThat isn't a royal title, so by some kind of a fiction I can't\r\npretend to understand he is not Prime Minister as a member of\r\nthe Royal Family.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can't ...\" the boy started.\r\n\r\n\"Steven! I forbid you to say that about ... Baron Cragdale. He\r\nbelieves, very sincerely, that the election was an expression of\r\nthe will of the people, and that it is his duty to bow to it.\"\r\n\r\nHe wished Otto Harkaman were there. He could probably name, without\r\nstopping for breath, a hundred great nations that went down into\r\nrubble because their rulers believed that they should bow instead\r\nof rule, and couldn't bring themselves to shed the blood of their\r\npeople. Edvard would have been a fine and admirable man, as a little\r\ncountry baron. Where he was, he was a disaster.\r\n\r\nHe asked if the People's Watchman had dragged their guns out from\r\nunder the bed and started carrying them in public yet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. You were quite right; they were armed, all the time. Not\r\njust small arms; combat vehicles and heavy weapons. As soon as the\r\nnew government was formed, they were given status as a part of the\r\nPlanetary Armed Forces. They have taken over every police station\r\non the planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the King?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he carries on, and shrugs and says, 'I just reign here.' What\r\nelse can he do? We've been whittling down and filching away the\r\npowers of the Throne for the last three centuries.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is Prince Bentrik doing, and why did he think there was danger\r\nthat you two would be used as hostages?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's going to fight,\" she said. \"Don't ask me how, or what with.\r\nMaybe as a guerrilla in the mountains, I don't know. But if he can't\r\nlick them, he won't join them. I wanted to stay with him and help\r\nhim; he told me I could help him best by placing myself and Steven\r\nwhere he wouldn't worry about us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to stay,\" the boy said. \"I could have fought with him.\r\nBut he said that I must take care of Mother. And if he were killed,\r\nI must be able to avenge him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk like a Sword-Worlder; I told you that once before.\" He\r\nhesitated, then turned again to Princess Bentrik. \"How is little\r\nPrincess Myrna?\" he asked, and then, trying to be casual, added,\r\n\"and Lady Valerie?\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed so clearly real and present to him, blue eyes and\r\nspace-black hair, more real than Elaine had been to him for years.\r\n\r\n\"They're at Cragdale; they'll be safe there. I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAttempting to conceal the presence on Tanith of Prince Bentrik's\r\nwife and son was pushing caution beyond necessity. Admitted that\r\nthe news would leak back to Marduk via Gilgamesh, it was over seven\r\nhundred light-years to the latter and almost a thousand from there\r\nto the former. Better that Princess Lucile should enjoy Rivington\r\nsociety, such as it was, and escape, for a moment now and then, from\r\nanxiety about her husband. At ten--no, almost twelve; it had been a\r\nyear and a half since Trask had left Marduk--the boy Count of Ravary\r\nwas more easily diverted. At last, he was among real Space Vikings,\r\non a Space Viking planet, and he was trying to be everywhere and see\r\neverything at once. No doubt he would be imagining himself a Space\r\nViking, returning to Marduk with a vast armada to rescue his father\r\nand the King from Zaspar Makann.\r\n\r\nTrask was satisfied with that; as a host he left much to be desired.\r\nHe had his worries, too, and all of them bore the same name: Prince\r\nViktor of Xochitl. He went over with Manfred Ravallo everything the\r\ncaptain of the _Black Star_ could tell him. He had talked once with\r\nViktor; the lord of Xochitl had been coldly polite and noncommittal.\r\nHis subordinates had been frankly hostile. There had been five ships\r\non orbit or landed at Viktor's spaceport beside the usual\r\nGilgameshers and itinerant traders, two of them Viktor's own, and a\r\nbig armed freighter had come in from Haulteclere as the _Black Star_\r\nwas leaving. There was considerable activity at the shipyards and\r\naround the spaceport, as though in preparation for something on a\r\nlarge scale.\r\n\r\nXochitl was a thousand light-years from Tanith. He rejected\r\nimmediately the idea of launching a preventative attack; his ships\r\nmight reach Xochitl to find it undefended, and then return to find\r\nTanith devastated. Things like that had happened in space-war. The\r\nonly thing to do was sit tight, defend Tanith when Viktor attacked,\r\nand then counterattack if he had any ships left by that time.\r\nPrince Viktor was probably reasoning in the same way.\r\n\r\nHe had no time to think about Andray Dunnan, except, now and then,\r\nto wish that Otto Harkaman would stop thinking about him and bring\r\nthe _Corisande_ home. He needed that ship on Tanith, and the wits\r\nand courage of her commander.\r\n\r\nMore news--Gilgamesh sources--came in from Xochitl. There were only\r\ntwo ships, both armed merchantmen, on the planet. Prince Viktor had\r\nspaced out with the rest an estimated two thousand hours before the\r\nstory reached him. That was twice as long as it would take the\r\nXochitl armada to reach Tanith. He hadn't gone to Beowulf; that was\r\nonly sixty-five hours from Tanith and they would have heard about\r\nit long ago. Or Amaterasu, or Khepera. How many ships he had was\r\na question; not fewer than five, and possibly more. He could have\r\nslipped into the Tanith system and hidden his ships on one of the\r\nouter uninhabitable planets. He sent Valkanhayn and Ravallo\r\nmicrojumping their ships from one to another to check. They returned\r\nto report in the negative. At least, Viktor of Xochitl wasn't camped\r\ninside their own system, waiting for them to leave Tanith open\r\nto attack.\r\n\r\nBut he was somewhere, and up to nothing even resembling good, and\r\nthere was no possible way of guessing when his ships would be\r\nemerging on Tanith. The only thing to do was wait for him. When he\r\ndid, Trask was confident that he would emerge from hyperspace into\r\nserious trouble. He had the _Nemesis_, the _Space Scourge_, the\r\n_Black Star_ and _Queen Flavia_, the strongly rebuilt _Lamia_, and\r\nseveral independent Space Viking ships, among them the _Damnthing_\r\nof his friend Roger-fan-Morvill Esthersan, who had volunteered to\r\nstay and help in the defense. This, of course, was not pure\r\naltruism. If Viktor attacked and had his fleet blown to\r\nEm-See-Square, Xochitl would lie open and unprotected, and there\r\nwas enough loot on Xochitl to cram everybody's ships. Everybody's\r\nships who had ships when the Battle of Tanith was over, of course.\r\n\r\nHe was apologetic to Princess Bentrik:\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry you jumped out of Zaspar Makann's frying pan into\r\nPrince Viktor's fire,\" he began.\r\n\r\nShe laughed at that. \"I'll take my chances on the fire. I seem to\r\nsee a lot of good firemen around. If there is a battle you will see\r\nthat Steven's in a safe place, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a space attack, there are no safe places. I'll keep him with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Count of Ravary wanted to know which ship he would serve\r\non when the attack came.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you won't be on any ship, Count. You'll be on my staff.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the _Corisande_ came out of hyperspace. Harkaman was\r\nguardedly noncommittal by screen. Trask took a landing craft and\r\nwent out to meet the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Marduk doesn't like us, any more,\" Harkaman told him. \"They have\r\nships on all their trade-planets, and they all have orders to fire\r\non any, repeat any, Space Vikings, including the ships of the\r\nself-styled Prince of Tanith. I got this from Captain Garravay of\r\nthe _Vindex_. After we were through talking, we fought a nice little\r\nship-to-ship action for him to make films of. I don't think anybody\r\ncould see anything wrong with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This order came from Makann?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the Admiral commanding. He isn't your friend Shefter; Shefter\r\nretired on account of quote ill-health unquote. He is now in a quote\r\nhospital unquote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's Prince Bentrik?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows. Charges of high treason were brought against him,\r\nand he just vanished. Gone underground, or secretly arrested and\r\nexecuted; take your choice.\"\r\n\r\nHe wondered just what he'd tell Princess Lucile and Count Steven.\r\n\r\n\"They have ships on all the planets they trade with. Fourteen\r\nof them. That isn't to catch Dunnan. That's to disperse the Navy\r\naway from Marduk. They don't trust the Navy. Is Prince Edvard\r\nstill Prime Minister?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, as of Garravay's last information. It seems Makann is behaving\r\nin a scrupulously legal manner, outside of making his People's\r\nWatchmen part of the armed forces. Protesting his devotion to\r\nthe King every time he opens his mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"When will the fire be, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh? Oh yes, you were reading up on Hitler. That I don't know.\r\nProbably happened by now.\"\r\n\r\nHe just told Princess Lucile that her husband had gone into hiding;\r\nhe couldn't be sure whether she was relieved or more worried. The\r\nboy was sure that he was doing something highly romantic and heroic.\r\n\r\nSome of the volunteers tired of waiting, after another thousand\r\nhours, and spaced out. The _Viking's Gift_ of Beowulf came in with\r\na cargo, and went on orbit after discharging it to join the watch.\r\nA Gilgamesher came in from Amaterasu and reported everything quiet\r\nthere; as soon as her captain had sold his cargo, with a minimum of\r\nhaggling, he spaced out again. His behavior convinced everybody that\r\nthe attack would come in a matter of hours.\r\n\r\nIt didn't.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree thousand hours had passed since the first warning had reached\r\nTanith, that made five thousand since Viktor's ships were supposed\r\nto have left Xochitl. There were those, Boake Valkanhayn among them,\r\nwho doubted, now, if he ever had.\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing's just a big Gilgamesher lie,\" he was declaring.\r\n\"Somebody--Nikky Gratham, or the Everrards, or maybe Viktor\r\nhimself--paid them to tell us that, to pin our ships down here.\r\nOr they made it up themselves, so they could make hay on our\r\ntrade-planets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go down to the Ghetto and clean out the whole gang,\" somebody\r\nelse took up. \"Anything one of them's in, they're all in together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nifflheim with that; let's all space out for Xochitl,\" Manfred\r\nRavallo proposed. \"We have enough ships to lick them on Tanith,\r\nwe have enough to lick them on their own planet.\"\r\n\r\nHe managed to talk them out of both courses of action--what was he,\r\nanyhow; sovereign Prince of Tanith, or the non-ruling King of Marduk,\r\nor just the chieftain of a disciplineless gang of barbarians? One of\r\nthe independents spaced out in disgust. The next day, two others\r\ncame in, loaded with booty from a raid on Braggi, and decided to\r\nstay around for a while and see what happened.\r\n\r\nAnd four days after that, a five-hundred-foot hyperspace yacht,\r\nbearing the daggers and chevrons of Bigglersport, came in. As soon\r\nas she was out of the last microjump, she began calling by screen.\r\n\r\nTrask didn't know the man who was screening, but Hugh Rathmore did;\r\nDuke Joris' confidential secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Prince Trask; I must speak to you as soon as possible,\" he began,\r\nalmost stuttering. Whatever the urgency of his mission, one would\r\nhave thought that a three-thousand-hour voyage would have taken some\r\nof the edge from it. \"It is of the first importance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are speaking to me. This screen is reasonably secure. And if\r\nit's of the first importance, the sooner you tell me about it....\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince Trask, you must come to Gram, with every man and every ship\r\nyou can command. Satan only knows what's happening there now, but\r\nthree thousand hours ago, when the Duke sent me off, Omfray of Glaspyth\r\nwas landing on Wardshaven. He has a fleet of eight ships, furnished\r\nto him by his wife's kinsman, the King of Haulteclere. They are commanded\r\nby King Konrad's Space Viking cousin, the Prince of Xochitl.\"\r\n\r\nThen a look of shocked surprise came into the face of the man in the\r\nscreen, and Trask wondered why, until he realized that he had leaned\r\nback in his chair and was laughing uproariously. Before he could\r\napologize, the man in the screen had found his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I know, Prince Trask; you have no reason to think kindly of King\r\nAngus--the former King Angus, or maybe even the late King Angus,\r\nI suppose he is now--but a murderer like Omfray of Glaspyth....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt took a little time to explain to the confidential secretary of\r\nthe Duke of Bigglersport the humor of the situation.\r\n\r\nThere were others at Rivington to whom it was not immediately\r\nevident. The professional Space Vikings, men like Valkanhayn and\r\nRavallo and Alvyn Karffard, were disgusted. Here they'd been\r\nsitting, on combat alert, all these months, and, if they'd only\r\nknown, they could have gone to Xochitl and looted it clean long ago.\r\nThe Gram party were outraged. Angus of Wardshaven had been bad\r\nenough, with the hereditary taint of the Mad Baron of Blackcliffe,\r\nand Queen Evita and her rapacious family, but even he was preferable\r\nto a murderous villain--some even called him a fiend in human\r\nshape--like Omfray of Glaspyth.\r\n\r\nBoth parties, of course, were positive as to where their Prince's\r\nduty lay. The former insisted that everything on Tanith that could\r\nbe put into hyperspace should be dispatched at once to Xochitl, to\r\nhaul back from it everything except a few absolutely immovable\r\nnatural features of the planet. The latter clamored, just as loudly\r\nand passionately, that everybody on Tanith who could pull a trigger\r\nshould be embarked at once on a crusade for the deliverance of Gram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"You don't want to do either, do you?\" Harkaman asked him, when they\r\nwere alone after the second day of acrimony.\r\n\r\n\"Nifflheim, no! This crowd that wants an attack on Xochitl; you know\r\nwhat would happen if we did that?\" Harkaman was silent, waiting for\r\nhim to continue. \"Inside a year, four or five of these small\r\nplanet-holders like Gratham and the Everrards would combine against\r\nus and make a slag-pile out of Tanith.\"\r\n\r\nHarkaman nodded agreement. \"Since we warned him the first time,\r\nViktor's kept his ships away from our planets. If we attacked\r\nXochitl now, without provocation, nobody'd know what to expect from\r\nus. People like Nikky Gratham and Tobbin of Nergal and the Everrards\r\nof Hoth get nervous around unpredictable dangers, and when they get\r\nnervous they get trigger-happy.\" He puffed slowly on his pipe and\r\nthen said: \"Then you'll be going back to Gram.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't follow; just because Valkanhayn and Ravallo and that\r\ncrowd are wrong doesn't make Valpry and Rathmore and Ffayle right.\r\nYou heard what I was telling those very people at Karvall House, the\r\nday I met you. And you've seen what's been happening on Gram since\r\nwe came out here. Otto, the Sword-Worlds are finished; they're half\r\ndecivilized now. Civilization is alive and growing here on Tanith.\r\nI want to stay here and help it grow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, Lucas,\" Harkaman said. \"You're Prince of Tanith, and I'm only\r\nthe Admiral. But I'm telling you; you'll have to do something, or\r\nthis whole setup of yours will fall apart. As it stands, you can\r\nattack Xochitl and the Back-To-Gram party would go along, or you\r\ncan decide on this crusade against Omfray of Glaspyth and the\r\nRaid-Xochitl-Now party would go along. But if you let this go on\r\nmuch longer, you won't have any influence over either party.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then I will be finished. And in a few years, Tanith will be\r\nfinished.\" He rose and paced across the room and back. \"Well, I\r\nwon't raid Xochitl; I told you why, and you agreed. And I won't\r\nspend the men and ships and wealth of Tanith in any Sword-World\r\ndynastic squabble. Great Satan, Otto; you were in the Durendal War.\r\nThis is the same thing, and it'll go on for another half a century.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came out here after Andray Dunnan, didn't I?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid Ravallo and Valpry, or even Valkanhayn and Morland,\r\nwon't be as interested in Dunnan as you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will interest them in him. Remember, I was reading up on\r\nHitler, coming in from Marduk? I will tell them all a big lie.\r\nSuch a big lie that nobody will dare to disbelieve it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I was afraid of Viktor of Xochitl?\" he demanded. \"Half\r\na dozen ships; we could make a new Van Allen belt around Tanith of\r\nthem, with what we have here. Our real enemy is on Marduk, not\r\nXochitl; his name's Zaspar Makann. Zaspar Makann, and Andray Dunnan,\r\nthe man I came out from Gram to hunt; they're in alliance, and\r\nI believe Dunnan is on Marduk, himself, now.\"\r\n\r\nThe delegation who had come out from Gram in the yacht of the\r\nDuke of Bigglersport were unimpressed. Marduk was only a name to\r\nthem, one of the fabulous civilized Old Federation planets no\r\nSword-Worlder had ever seen. Zaspar Makann wasn't even that. And\r\nso much had happened on Gram since the murder of Elaine Karvall and\r\nthe piracy of the _Enterprise_ that they had completely forgotten\r\nAndray Dunnan. That put them at a disadvantage. All the people whom\r\nthey were trying to convince, the half-hundred members of the new\r\nnobility of Tanith, spoke a language they didn't understand. They\r\ndidn't even understand the proposition, and couldn't argue against it.\r\n\r\nPaytrik Morland, who was Gram-born and had been speaking for\r\na return in force to fight against Omfray of Glaspyth and his\r\nsupporters, defected from them at once. He had been on Marduk and\r\nknew who Zaspar Makann was; he had made friends with the Royal Navy\r\nofficers, and had been shocked to hear that they were now enemies.\r\nManfred Ravallo and Boake Valkanhayn, among the more articulate of\r\nthe Raid-Xochitl-Now party, snatched up the idea and seemed\r\nconvinced that they'd thought of it themselves all along. Valkanhayn\r\nhad been on Gimli and talked to Mardukan naval officers; Ravallo had\r\nbrought Princess Bentrik to Tanith and heard her stories on the\r\nvoyage. They began adducing arguments in support of Trask's thesis.\r\nOf course Dunnan and Makann were in collusion. Who tipped Dunnan off\r\nthat the _Victrix_ would be on Audhumla? Makann; his spies in the\r\nNavy tipped him. What about the _Honest Horris_; wasn't Makann\r\nblocking any investigation about her? Why was Admiral Shefter\r\nretired as soon as Makann got into power?\r\n\r\n\"Well, here; we don't know anything about this Zaspar Makann,\" the\r\nconfidential secretary and spokesman of the Duke of Bigglersport began.\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't,\" Otto Harkaman told him. \"I suggest you keep quiet\r\nand listen, till you find out a little about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I wouldn't be surprised if Dunnan was on Marduk all the time\r\nwe were hunting for him,\" Valkanhayn said.\r\n\r\nTrask began to wonder. What would Hitler have done if he'd told one\r\nof his big lies, and then found it turning into the truth? Maybe\r\nMakann had been on Marduk.... No; he couldn't have hidden half a\r\ndozen ships on a civilized planet. Not even at the bottom of an\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't be surprised,\" Alvyn Karffard was shouting, \"if Andray\r\nDunnan _was_ Zaspar Makann. I know he doesn't look like Dunnan, we\r\nall saw him on screen, but there's such a thing as plastic surgery.\"\r\n\r\nThat was making the big lie just a trifle too big. Zaspar Makann was\r\nsix inches shorter than Dunnan; there are some things no plastic\r\nsurgery could do. Paytrik Morland, who had known Dunnan and had seen\r\nMakann on screen, ought to have known that too, but he either didn't\r\nthink of it or didn't want to weaken a case he had completely accepted.\r\n\r\n\"As far as I can find out, nobody even heard of Makann till about\r\nfive years ago. That would be about the time Dunnan would have\r\narrived on Marduk,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the big room in which they were meeting had become a\r\nbabel of voices, everybody trying to convince everybody else that\r\nthey'd known it all along. Then the Back-To-Gram party received its\r\n_coup-de-grace_; Lothar Ffayle, to whom the emissaries of Duke Joris\r\nhad looked for their strongest support, went over.\r\n\r\n\"You people want us to abandon a planet we've built up from nothing,\r\nand all the time and money we've invested in it, to go back to Gram\r\nand pull your chestnuts out of the fire? Gehenna with you! We're\r\nstaying here and defending our own planet. If you're smart, you'll\r\nstay here with us.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bigglersport delegation was still on Tanith, trying to recruit\r\nmercenaries from the King of Tradetown and dickering with a\r\nGilgamesher to transport them to Gram, when the big lie turned\r\ninto something like the truth.\r\n\r\nThe observation post on the Moon of Tanith picked up an emergence at\r\ntwenty light-minutes due north of the planet. Half an hour later,\r\nthere was another one at five light-minutes; a very small one, and\r\nthen a third at two light-seconds, and this was detectable by radar\r\nand microray as a ship's pinnace. He wondered if something had\r\nhappened on Amaterasu or Beowulf; somebody like Gratham or the\r\nEverrards might have decided to take advantage of the defensive\r\nmobilization on Tanith. Then they switched the call from the pinnace\r\nover to his screen, and Prince Simon Bentrik was looking out of it.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to see you! Your wife and son are here, worried about you,\r\nbut safe and well.\" He turned to shout to somebody to find young\r\nCount Steven of Ravary and tell him to tell his mother. \"How are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a broken leg when I left Moonbase, but that's mended on the\r\nway,\" Bentrik said. \"I have little Princess Myrna aboard with me.\r\nFor all I know, she's Queen of Marduk, now.\" He gulped slightly.\r\n\"Prince Trask, we've come as beggars. We're begging help for\r\nour planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've come as honored guests, and you'll get all the help we can\r\ngive you.\" He blessed the Xochitl invasion scare, and the big lie\r\nwhich was rapidly ceasing to be a lie; Tanith had the ships and\r\nmen and the will to act. \"What happened? Makann deposed the King\r\nand took over?\"\r\n\r\nIt came to that, Bentrik told him. It had started even before the\r\nelection. The People's Watchmen had possessed weapons that had been\r\nmade openly and legally on Marduk for trade to the Neobarbarian\r\nplanets and then clandestinely diverted to secret People's Welfare\r\narsenals. Some of the police had gone over to Makann; the rest had\r\nbeen terrorized into inaction. There had been riots fomented in\r\nworking-class districts of all the cities as pretexts for further\r\nterrorization. The election had been a farce of bribery and\r\nintimidation. Even so, Makann's party had failed of a complete\r\nmajority in the Chamber of Representatives, and had been compelled\r\nto patch up a shady coalition in order to elect a favorable Chamber\r\nof Delegates.\r\n\r\n\"And, of course, they elected Makann Chancellor; that did it,\"\r\nBentrik said. \"All the opposition leaders in the Chamber of\r\nRepresentatives have been arrested, on all kinds of ridiculous\r\ncharges--sex-crimes, receiving bribes, being in the pay of foreign\r\npowers, nothing too absurd. Then they rammed through a law\r\nempowering the Chancellor to fill vacancies in the Chamber of\r\nRepresentatives by appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did the Crown Prince lend himself to a thing like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He hoped that he could exercise some control. The Royal Family\r\nis an almost holy symbol to the people. Even Makann was forced\r\nto pretend loyalty to the King and the Crown Prince....\"\r\n\r\n\"It didn't work; he played right into Makann's hands. What happened?\"\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince had been assassinated. The assassin, an unknown man\r\nbelieved to be a Gilgamesher, had been shot to death by People's\r\nWatchmen guarding Prince Edvard at once. Immediately Makann had\r\nseized the Royal Palace to protect the King, and immediately there\r\nhad been massacres by People's Watchmen everywhere. The Mardukan\r\nPlanetary Army had ceased to exist; Makann's story was that there\r\nhad been a military plot against the King and the government.\r\nScattered over the planet in small detachments, the army had been\r\nwiped out in two nights and a day. Now Makann was recruiting it up\r\nagain, exclusively from the People's Welfare Party.\r\n\r\n\"You weren't just sitting on your hands, were you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Bentrik replied. \"I was doing something I wouldn't have\r\nthought myself capable of, a few years ago. Organizing a mutineering\r\nconspiracy in the Royal Mardukan Navy. After Admiral Shefter was\r\nforcibly retired and shut up in an insane asylum, I disappeared\r\nand turned into a civilian contragravity-lifter operator at the\r\nMalverton Navy Yard. Finally, when I was suspected, one of the\r\nofficers--he was arrested and tortured to death later--managed\r\nto smuggle me onto a lighter for the Moonbase. I was an orderly\r\nin the hospital there. The day the Crown Prince was murdered, we\r\nhad a mutiny of our own. We killed everybody we even suspected of\r\nbeing a Makannist. The Moonbase has been under attack from the\r\nplanet ever since.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a stir behind him; turning, he saw Princess Bentrik and\r\nthe boy enter the room. He rose.\r\n\r\n\"We'll talk about this later. There are some people here....\"\r\n\r\nHe motioned them forward and turned away, shoo-ing everybody else\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe news was all over Rivington, and then all over Tanith, while\r\nthe pinnace was still coming down. There was a crowd at the\r\nspaceport, staring as the little craft, with its blazon of the\r\ncrowned and planet-throned dragon, settled onto its landing legs,\r\nand reporters of the Tanith News Service with their screen pickups.\r\nHe met Prince Bentrik, a little in advance of the others, and\r\nmanaged to whisper to him hastily:\r\n\r\n\"While you're talking to anybody here, always remember that Andray\r\nDunnan is working with Zaspar Makann, and as soon as Makann\r\nconsolidates his position he's sending an expedition against\r\nTanith.\"\r\n\r\n\"How in blazes did you find that out, here?\" Bentrik demanded.\r\n\"From the Gilgameshers?\"\r\n\r\nThen Harkaman and Rathmore and Valkanhayn and Lothar Ffayle and\r\nthe others were crowding up behind, and more people were coming off\r\nthe pinnace, and Prince Bentrik was trying to embrace both his wife\r\nand his son at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"Prince Trask.\" He started at the voice, and was looking into deep\r\nblue eyes under coal-black hair. His pulse gave a sudden jump, and\r\nhe said, \"Valerie!\" and then, \"Lady Alvarath; I'm most happy to see\r\nyou here.\" Then he saw who was beside her, and squatted on his heels\r\nto bring himself down to a convenient size. \"And Princess Myrna.\r\nWelcome to Tanith, Your Highness!\"\r\n\r\nThe child flung her arms around his neck. \"Oh, Prince Lucas! I'm so\r\nglad to see you. There's been such awful things happened!\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be anything awful happen here, Princess Myrna. You are\r\namong friends; friends with whom you have a treaty. Remember?\"\r\n\r\nThe child began to cry, bitterly. \"That was when I was just a\r\nplay-Queen. And now I know what they meant when they talked about\r\nwhen Grandpa and Pappa would be through being King. Pappa didn't\r\neven get to be King!\"\r\n\r\nSomething big and warm and soft was trying to push between them;\r\na dog with long blond hair and floppy ears. In a year and a half,\r\npuppies can grow surprisingly. Mopsy was trying to lick his face.\r\nHe took the dog by the collar and straightened.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Valerie, will you come with us?\" he asked. \"I'm going to find\r\nquarters for Princess Myrna.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Is it Princess Myrna, or is it Queen Myrna?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nPrince Bentrik shook his head. \"We don't know. The King was alive\r\nwhen we left Moonbase, but that was five hundred hours ago. We don't\r\nknow anything about her mother, either. She was at the Palace when\r\nPrince Edvard was murdered; we've heard absolutely nothing about\r\nher. The King made a few screen appearances, parroting things Makann\r\nwanted him to say. Under hypnosis. That was probably the very least\r\nof what they did to him. They've turned him into a zombi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how did Myrna get to Moonbase?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was Lady Valerie, as much as anybody else. She and Sir Thomas\r\nKobbly, and Captain Rainer. They armed the servants at Cragdale with\r\nhunting rifles and everything else they could scrape up, captured\r\nPrince Edvard's space-yacht, and took off in her. Took a couple of\r\nhits from ground batteries getting off, and from ships around\r\nMoonbase getting in. Ships of the Royal Mardukan Navy!\" he added\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\nThe pinnace in which they had made the trip to Tanith had taken\r\na few hits, too, running the blockade. Not many; her captain had\r\nthrown her into hyperspace almost at once.\r\n\r\n\"They sent the yacht off to Gimli,\" Bentrik said. \"From there,\r\nthey'll try to rally as many of the Royal Navy units as haven't gone\r\nover to Makann. They're to assemble on Gimli and await my return.\r\nIf I don't return in fifteen hundred hours from the time I left\r\nMoonbase, they're to use their own judgment. I'd expect that\r\nthey'd move in on Marduk and attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's sixty-odd days,\" Otto Harkaman said. \"That's an awfully long\r\ntime to expect that lunar base to hold out, against a whole planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a strong base. It was built four hundred years ago, when\r\nMarduk was fighting a combination of six other planets. It held out\r\nagainst continuous attack, once, for almost a year. It's been\r\nconstantly strengthened ever since.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what have they to throw at it?\" Harkaman persisted.\r\n\r\n\"When I left, six ships of the former Royal Navy, that had gone\r\nover to Makann. Four fifteen-hundred-footers, same class as the\r\n_Victrix_, and two thousand-footers. Then, there were four of\r\nAndray Dunnan's ships--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, he really is on Marduk?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you knew that, and I was wondering how you'd found out.\r\nYes: _Fortuna_, _Bolide_, and two armed merchantmen, a Baldurbuilt\r\nship called the _Reliable_, and your friend _Honest Horris_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't really believe Dunnan was on Marduk?\" Boake Valkanhayn\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Actually, I didn't. I had to have some kind of a story, to talk\r\nthose people out of that crusade against Omfray of Glaspyth.\" He\r\nleft unmentioned Valkanhayn's own insistence on a plundering\r\nexpedition against Xochitl. \"Now that it turns out to be true,\r\nI'm not surprised. We decided, long ago, that Dunnan was planning\r\nto raid Marduk. It appears that we underestimated him. Maybe he\r\nwas reading about Hitler, too. He wasn't planning any raid; he\r\nwas planning conquest, in the only way a great civilization can\r\nbe conquered--by subversion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Harkaman put in. \"Five years ago, when Dunnan started this\r\nprogramme, who was this Makann, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody,\" Bentrik said. \"A crackpot agitator in Drepplin; he had\r\na coven of fellow-crackpots, who met in the back room of a saloon\r\nand had their office in a cigar box. The next year, he had a suite\r\nof offices and was buying time on a couple of telecasts. The year\r\nafter that, he had three telecast stations of his own, and\r\nwas holding rallies and meetings of thousands of people. And\r\nso on, upward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Dunnan financed him, and moved in behind him, the same way\r\nMakann moved in behind the King. And Dunnan will have him shot\r\nthe way he had Prince Edvard shot, and use the murder as a pretext\r\nto liquidate his personal followers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then he'll own Marduk. And we'll have the Mardukan navy coming\r\nout of hyperspace on Tanith,\" Valkanhayn added. \"So we go to Marduk\r\nand smash him now, while he's still little enough to smash.\"\r\n\r\nThere had been a few who had wanted to do that about Hitler, and\r\na great many, later, who had regretted that it hadn't been done.\r\n\r\n\"The _Nemesis_, the _Corisande_, and the _Space Scourge_ for sure?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\nHarkaman and Valkanhayn agreed; Valkanhayn thought the _Viking's\r\nGift_ of Beowulf would go along, and Harkaman was almost sure of\r\nthe _Black Star_ and _Queen Flavia_. He turned to Bentrik.\r\n\r\n\"Start that pinnace off for Gimli at once; within the hour if\r\npossible. We don't know how many ships will be gathered there,\r\nbut we don't want them wasted in detail-attacks. Tell whoever's\r\nin command there that ships from Tanith are on the way, and to\r\nwait for them.\"\r\n\r\nFifteen hundred hours, less the five hundred Bentrik was in space\r\nfrom Marduk. He hadn't time to estimate voyage-time to Gimli from\r\nthe other Mardukan trade-planets, and nobody could estimate how many\r\nships would respond.\r\n\r\n\"It may take us a little time to get an effective fleet together.\r\nEven after we get through arguing about it. Argument,\" he told\r\nBentrik, \"is not exclusively a feature of democracies.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nActually, there was very little argument, and most of that among\r\nthe Mardukans. Prince Bentrik insisted that Crown Princess Myrna\r\nwould have to be taken along; King Mikhyl would be either dead or\r\nbrainwashed into imbecility by now, and they would have to have\r\nsomebody to take the throne. Lady Valerie Alvarath, Sir Thomas\r\nKobbly, the tutor, and the nurse Margot refused to be separated\r\nfrom her. Prince Bentrik was equally firm, with less success, on\r\nleaving his wife and son on Tanith. In the end, it was agreed that\r\nthe entire Mardukan party would space out on the _Nemesis_.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Bigglersport delegation attempted an impassioned\r\ntirade about going to the aid of strangers while their own planet\r\nwas being enslaved. He was booed down by everybody else and informed\r\nthat Tanith was being defended where a planet ought to be, on\r\nsomebody else's real estate. When the Bigglersporters emerged\r\nfrom the meeting, they found that their own space-yacht had been\r\ncommandeered and sent off to Amaterasu and Beowulf for assistance,\r\nthat the regiment of local infantry they had enlisted from the King\r\nof Tradetown had been taken over by the Rivington authorities, and\r\nthat the Gilgamesh freighter they had chartered to transport them\r\nto Gram would now take them to Marduk.\r\n\r\nThe problem broke into two halves: the purely naval action that\r\nwould be fought to relieve the Moon of Marduk, if it still held out,\r\nand to destroy the Dunnan and Makann ships, and the ground-fighting\r\nproblem of wiping out Makann's supporters and restoring the Mardukan\r\nmonarchy. A great many of the people of Marduk would be glad of\r\na chance to turn on Makann, once they had arms and were properly\r\nsupported. Combat weapons were almost unknown among the people,\r\nhowever, and even sporting arms uncommon. All the small arms and\r\nlight artillery and auto-weapons available were gathered up.\r\n\r\nThe _Grendelsbane_ came in from Beowulf, and the _Sun Goddess_ from\r\nAmaterasu. Three independent Space Viking ships were still in orbit\r\non Tanith; they joined the expedition. There would be trouble with\r\nthem on Marduk; they'd want to loot. Let the Mardukans worry about\r\nthat. They could charge it off as part of the price for letting\r\nZaspar Makann get into power in the first place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were twelve spacecraft in line outside the Moon of Tanith,\r\ncounting the three independents and the forcibly chartered\r\nGilgamesher troop-transport; that was the biggest fleet Space\r\nVikings had ever assembled in their history. Alvyn Karffard said\r\nas much while they were checking the formation by screen.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a Space Viking fleet,\" Prince Bentrik differed. \"There\r\nare only three Space Vikings in it. The rest are the ships of three\r\ncivilized planets. Tanith, Beowulf and Amaterasu.\"\r\n\r\nKarffard was surprised. \"You mean _we're_ civilized planets? Like\r\nMarduk, or Baldur or Odin, or...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\nTrask smiled. He'd begun to suspect something of the sort a couple\r\nof years ago. He hadn't really been sure until now. His most junior\r\nstaff officer, Count Steven of Ravary, didn't seem to appreciate\r\nthe compliment.\r\n\r\n\"We _are_ Space Vikings!\" he insisted. \"And we are going to battle\r\nwith the Neobarbarians of Zaspar Makann.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I won't argue the last half of it, Steven,\" his father told him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you people done yakking about who's civilized and who isn't?\"\r\nGuatt Kirbey asked. \"Then give the signal. All the other ships are\r\nready to jump.\"\r\n\r\nTrask pressed the button on the desk in front of him. A light went\r\non over Kirbey's control panel as one would on each of the other\r\nships. He said, \"Jumping,\" around the stem of his pipe, and twisted\r\nthe red handle and shoved it in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty hours, in the private universe that was the\r\n_Nemesis_; outside, nothing else existed, and inside there was\r\nnothing to do but wait, as each hour carried them six trillion miles\r\nnearer to Gimli. At first, the ruthless and terrible Space Viking,\r\nSteven, Count of Ravary, was wildly excited, but before long he\r\nfound that there was nothing exciting going on; it was just a\r\nspaceship, and he'd been on ships before. Her Highness the Crown\r\nPrincess, or maybe her Majesty the Queen of Marduk, stopped being\r\nexcited about the same time, and she and Steven and Mopsy played\r\ntogether. Of course, Myrna was only a girl, and two years younger\r\nthan Steven, but she was, or at least might be, his sovereign, and\r\nbeside, she had been in a space action, if you call what lies\r\nbetween a planet and its satellite space and if you call being shot\r\nat without being able to shoot back an action, and Relentless\r\nRavary, the Interstellar Terror, had not. This rather made up\r\nfor being a girl and a mere baby of going-on-ten.\r\n\r\nOne thing, there were no lessons. Sir Thomas Kobbly fancied himself\r\nas a landscape-painter and spent most of his time arguing techniques\r\nwith Vann Larch, and Steven's tutor, Captain Rainer was a normal-space\r\nastrogator and found a kindred spirit in Sharll Renner. This left\r\nLady Valerie Alvarath at a loose end. There were plenty of volunteers\r\nto help her fill in the time, but Rank Hath Its Privileges; Trask\r\nundertook to see to it that she did not suffer excessively from\r\nshipboard ennui.\r\n\r\nSharll Renner and Captain Rainer approached him, during the cocktail\r\nhour before dinner, some hundred hours short of emergence.\r\n\r\n\"We think we've figured out where Dunnan's base is,\" Renner said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good!\" Everybody else had, on a different planet. \"Where's yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Abaddon,\" the Count of Ravary's tutor said. When he saw that the\r\nname meant nothing to Trask, he added, \"The ninth, outer, planet of\r\nthe Marduk system.\" He said it disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; remember how you had Boake and Manfred out with their ships,\r\nchecking our outside planets to see if Prince Viktor might be hiding\r\non one of them? Well, what with the time element, and the way the\r\n_Honest Horris_ was shuttling back and forth from Marduk to some\r\nplace that wasn't Gimli, and the way Dunnan was able to bring his\r\nships in as soon as the shooting started on Marduk, we thought he\r\nmust be on an uninhabited outer planet of the Marduk system.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why we never thought of that, ourselves,\" Rainer put\r\nin. \"I suppose because nobody ever thinks of Abaddon for any reason.\r\nIt's only a small planet, about four thousand miles in diameter, and\r\nit's three and a half billion miles from primary. It's frozen solid.\r\nIt would take almost a year to get to it on Abbot drive, and if your\r\nship has Dillinghams, why not take a little longer and go to a good\r\nplanet? So nobody bothered with Abaddon.\"\r\n\r\nBut for Dunnan's purpose, it would be perfect. He called Prince\r\nBentrik and Alvyn Karffard to him; they found the idea instantly\r\nconvincing. They talked about it through dinner, and held a general\r\ndiscussion afterward. Even Guatt Kirbey, the ship's pessimist, could\r\nfind no objection to it. Trask and Bentrik began at once making\r\nbattle plans. Karffard wondered if they hadn't better wait till they\r\ngot to Gimli and discuss it with the others.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Trask told him. \"This is the flagship; here's where the\r\nstrategy is decided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how about the Mardukan Navy?\" Captain Rainer asked. \"I think\r\nFleet Admiral Bargham's in command at Gimli.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Simon Bentrik was silent for a moment, as though he realized,\r\nwith reluctance, that the big decision was no longer avoidable.\r\n\r\n\"He may be, at present, but he won't be when I get there. I will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But ... Your Highness, he's a fleet admiral; you're just a\r\ncommodore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not just a commodore. The King is a prisoner, and for all we\r\nknow dead. The Crown Prince is dead. The Princess Myrna is a child.\r\nI am assuming the position of Regent and Prince-Protector of the Realm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a little difficulty on Gimli with Fleet Admiral Bargham.\r\nCommodores didn't give orders to fleet admirals. Well, maybe regents\r\ndid, but who gave Prince Bentrik authority to call himself regent?\r\nRegents were elected by the Chamber of Delegates, on nomination of\r\nthe Chancellor.\r\n\r\n\"That's Zaspar Makann and his stooges you're talking about?\" Bentrik\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Constitution....\" He thought better of that, before\r\nsomebody asked him what Constitution. \"Well, a Regent has to be\r\nchosen by election. Even members of the Royal Family can't just\r\nmake themselves Regent by saying they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can. I just have. And I don't think there are going to be many\r\nmore elections, at least for the present. Not till we make sure the\r\npeople of Marduk can be trusted with the control of the government.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the pinnace from Moonbase reported that there were six Royal\r\nnavy battleships and four other craft attacking them,\" Bargham\r\nobjected. \"I only have four ships here; I sent for the ones on the\r\nother trade-planets, but I haven't heard from any of them. We can't\r\ngo there with only four ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen ships,\" Bentrik corrected. \"No, fifteen and one Gilgamesher\r\nwe're using for a troopship. I think that's enough. You'll remain\r\nhere on Gimli, in any case, admiral; as soon as the other ships come\r\nin, you'll follow to Marduk with them. I am now holding a meeting\r\naboard the Tanith flagship _Nemesis_. I want your four ship-commanders\r\naboard immediately. I am not including you because you're remaining\r\nhere to bring up the late comers and as soon as this meeting is over\r\nwe are spacing out.\"\r\n\r\nActually, they spaced out sooner; the meeting lasted the whole three\r\nhundred and fifty hours to Abaddon. A ship's captain, if he has a\r\ngood exec, as all of them had, needs only sit at his command-desk\r\nand look important while the ship is going into and emerging from\r\na long jump; the rest of the time he can study ancient history or\r\nwhatever his shipboard hobby is. Rather than waste three hundred and\r\nfifty hours of precious time, each captain turned his ship over to\r\nhis exec and remained aboard the _Nemesis_; even on so spacious a\r\ncraft the officers' country north of the engine rooms was crowded\r\nlike a tourist hotel in mid-season. One of the four Mardukans was\r\nthe Captain Garravay who had smuggled Bentrik's wife and son off\r\nMarduk, and the other three were just as pro-Bentrik, pro-Tanith,\r\nand anti-Makann. They were, on general principles, also anti-Bargham.\r\nThere must be something wrong with any fleet admiral who remained\r\nin his command after Zaspar Makann came to power.\r\n\r\nSo, as soon as they spaced out, there was a party. After that,\r\nthey settled down to planning the Battle of Abaddon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no Battle of Abaddon.\r\n\r\nIt was a dead planet, one side in night and the other in dim\r\ntwilight from the little speck of a sun three and a half billion\r\nmiles away, jagged mountains rising out of the snow that covered it\r\nfrom pole to pole. The snow on top would be frozen CO_2; according\r\nto the thermocouples, the surface temperature was well below\r\nminus-100 Centigrade. No ships on orbit circled it; there was\r\na little faint radiation, which could have been from naturally\r\nradioactive minerals; there was no electrical discharge detectable.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable bad language in the command room of the\r\n_Nemesis_. The captains of the other ships were screening in,\r\nwanting to know what to do.\r\n\r\n\"Go on in,\" Trask told them. \"Englobe the planet, and go down to\r\nwithin a mile if necessary. They could be hiding somewhere on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're not hiding at the bottom of any ocean, that's for\r\nsure,\" somebody said. It was one of those feeble jokes at which\r\neverybody laughs because nothing else is laughable about the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nFinally, they found it, at the north pole, which was no colder than\r\nanywhere else on the planet. First radiation leakage, the sort that\r\nwould come from a closed-down nuclear power plant. Then a modicum of\r\nelectrical discharge. Finally the telescopic screens picked up the\r\nspaceport, a huge oval amphitheater excavated out of a valley\r\nbetween two jagged mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nThe language in the command room was just as bad, but the tone had\r\nchanged. It was surprising what a wide range of emotions could be\r\nexpressed by a few simple blasphemies and obscenities. Everybody\r\nwho had been deriding Sharll Renner were now acclaiming him.\r\n\r\nBut it was lifeless. The ships came crowding in; air-locked\r\nlanding-craft full of space-armored ground-fighters went down.\r\nScreens in the command room lit as they transmitted in views.\r\nDepressions in the carbon-dioxide snow where the hundred-foot\r\npad-feet of ships' landing-legs had pressed down. Ranks of\r\ncargo-lighters that had plied to and from other ships or orbit.\r\nAnd, all around the cliff-walled perimeter, air-locked doors to\r\ncaverns and tunnels. A great many men, with a great deal of equipment,\r\nhad been working here in the estimated five or six years since\r\nAndray Dunnan--or somebody--had constructed this base.\r\n\r\nAndray Dunnan. They found his badge, the crescent, blue on black, on\r\nthings. They found equipment that Harkaman recognized as having been\r\npart of the original cargo stolen with the _Enterprise_. They even\r\nfound, in his living quarters, a blown-up photoprint picture of\r\nNevil Ormm, draped in black. But what they did not find was a single\r\nvehicle small enough to be taken aboard a ship, or a single scrap of\r\ncombat equipment, not even a pistol or a hand grenade.\r\n\r\nDunnan had gone, but they knew whither, and where to find him.\r\nThe conquest of Marduk had moved into its final phase.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarduk was on the other side of the sun from Abaddon with\r\nninety-five million miles--close, but not inconveniently so, Trask\r\nthought--to spare. Guatt Kirbey and the Mardukan astrogator who was\r\nhelping him made it within a light-minute. The Mardukan thought that\r\nwas fine; Kirbey didn't. The last microjump was aimed at the Moon of\r\nMarduk, which was plainly visible in the telescopic screen. They\r\ncame out within a light-second and a half, which Kirbey admitted was\r\nreasonably close. As soon as the screens cleared, they saw that they\r\nweren't too late. The Moon of Marduk was under fire and firing back.\r\n\r\nThey'd have detection, and he knew what they were detecting--a clump\r\nof sixteen rending distortions of the fabric of space-time, as\r\nsixteen ships came into sudden existence in the normal continuum.\r\nBeside him, Bentrik had a screen on; it was still milky-white,\r\nand he was speaking into a radio hand-phone.\r\n\r\n\"Simon Bentrik, Prince-Protector of Marduk, calling Moonbase.\"\r\nThen, slowly, he repeated his screen-combination twice. \"Come in,\r\nMoonbase; this is Simon Bentrik, Prince-Protector, speaking.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited ten seconds, and was about to start again, when the screen\r\nflickered. The man who appeared in it wore the insignia of a\r\nMardukan navy commodore. He needed a shave, but he was grinning\r\nhappily. Bentrik greeted him by name.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Simon; glad to see you. Your Highness, I mean; what is this\r\nPrince-Protector thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody had to do it. Is the King still alive?\"\r\n\r\nThe grin slid off the commodore's face, starting with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know. At first, Makann had him speaking by screen--you\r\nknow what it was like--urging everybody to obey and co-operate\r\nwith 'our trusted Chancellor.' Makann always appeared on the screen\r\nwith him.\"\r\n\r\nBentrik nodded. \"I remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before you left, Makann kept quiet, and let the King make the\r\nspeech. After a while, the King wasn't able to speak coherently;\r\nhe'd stammer, and repeat. So then Makann did all the talking; they\r\ncouldn't even depend on him to parrot what they were giving him with\r\nan earplug phone. Then he stopped appearing entirely. I suppose\r\nthere were physical symptoms they couldn't allow to be seen.\"\r\nBentrik was cursing horribly under his breath; the officer\r\nat Moonbase nodded. \"I hope for his sake that he is dead.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Goodman Mikhyl. Bentrik was saying, \"So do I.\" Trask agreed,\r\nmentally. The commodore at Moonbase was still talking:\r\n\r\n\"We got two more renegade RMN ships, within a hundred hours after\r\nyou left.\" He named them. \"And we got one of the Dunnan ships, the\r\n_Fortuna_. We blew out the Malverton Navy Yard. They're still using\r\nthe Antarctic Naval Base, but we've knocked out a good deal of that.\r\nWe got the _Honest Horris_. They made two attempts to land on us and\r\nlost a couple of ships. Eight hundred hours ago, they were joined by\r\nthe rest of Dunnan's fleet, five ships. They made a landing on\r\nMalverton while it was turned away from us. Makann announced that\r\nthey were RMN units from the trade-planets that had joined him. I\r\nsuppose the planet-side public swallowed that. He also announced that\r\ntheir commander, Admiral Dunnan, was in command of the People's\r\nArmed Forces.\"\r\n\r\nDunnan's ground-fighters would be in control of Malverton. By now,\r\nthe odds were that Makann was as much his prisoner as King Mikhyl\r\nVIII had been Makann's.\r\n\r\n\"So Dunnan has conquered Marduk. All he has to do, now, is make it\r\nstick,\" he said. \"I see four ships off Moonbase; how many more have\r\nthey?\"\r\n\r\n\"These are _Bolide_ and _Eclipse_, Dunnan's ships, and former Royal\r\nMardukan Navy ships _Champion_ and _Guardian_. There are five\r\norbiting off the planet: Ex-RMNS _Paladin_, and Dunnan ships\r\n_Starhopper_, _Banshee_, _Reliable_ and _Exporter_. The last\r\ntwo are listed as merchantmen, but they're performing like\r\nregulation battlecraft.\"\r\n\r\nThe four that had been circling Moonbase broke orbit and started\r\ntoward the relieving fleet; one took a hit from a Moonbase missile,\r\nwhich staggered her but did no evident damage. Two ships which had\r\nbeen orbiting the planet also changed course and started out. The\r\ncommand room was silent except for a subdued chuckling from a\r\ncomputer which was estimating enemy intentions by observed data and\r\nGames Theory. Three more came hurrying out from the planet, and the\r\ntwo in the lead slowed to let them catch up. He wanted to be able\r\nto engage the four from off the satellite before the five from the\r\nplanet joined them, but Karffard's computers said it couldn't be done.\r\n\r\n\"All right, we have to take all our bad eggs in one basket,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Try to hit them as soon after they join as possible.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe computers began chuckling again. The serving-robots were doing\r\na rush business in hot coffee. Prince Bentrik's son, sitting beside\r\nhis father, had stopped being Ruthless Ravary the Demon of the\r\nSpaceways and was a very young officer going into his first space\r\nbattle, more scared and at the same time happier than he had ever\r\nbeen in his short life. Captain Garravay of the _Vindex_ was making\r\nsignal to the other ships from Gimli: \"_Royal Navy; smash the\r\ntraitors first!_\" He could understand and sympathize, even if\r\nhe couldn't approve of putting personal ahead of tactical\r\nconsiderations, and made a quick sealed-beam call to Harkaman to be\r\nprepared to plug any holes they left in formation if they broke away\r\nin search of vengeance. He also ordered the _Black Star_ and the\r\n_Sun Goddess_ to shepherd the lightly armed and troop-crammed\r\nGilgamesh freighter out of danger. The two clumps of Dunnan-Makann\r\nships were converging rapidly, and Alvyn Karffard was screaming into\r\na phone to somebody to get more speed.\r\n\r\nAt a thousand miles, the missiles started going out, and the two\r\ngroups of ships, four and five, were equidistant from each other and\r\nfrom the allied fleet, at the points of a triangle that was growing\r\nsmaller by the second. The first fire-globes of intercepted missiles\r\nspread from their seeds of brief white light. A red light flashed on\r\nthe damage-board. An enemy ship took a hit. The captain of the\r\n_Queen Flavia_ was on a screen, saying that his ship was heavily\r\ndamaged. Three ships bearing the Mardukan dragon-and-planet circled\r\nmadly around each other at what looked, in the screen, like just\r\nover pistol-range, two of them firing into the third, which was\r\nreplying desperately. The third one blew up, and somebody was\r\nyelling out of a screenspeaker, \"Scratch one traitor!\"\r\n\r\nAnother ship blew up somewhere, and then another. He heard somebody\r\nsay, \"There went one of ours,\" and wondered which one it was. Not\r\nthe _Corisande_, he hoped; no, it wasn't, he could see her rushing\r\nafter two other ships which were, in turn, speeding toward the\r\n_Black Star_, the _Sun Goddess_ and the Gilgamesh freighter. Then\r\nthe _Nemesis_ and the _Starhopper_ were within gun-range, pounding\r\neach other savagely.\r\n\r\nThe battle had tied itself into a ball of gyrating, fire-spitting\r\nships that went rolling toward the planet, which was swinging in and\r\nout of the main viewscreen and growing rapidly larger. By the time\r\nthey were down to the inner edge of the exosphere, the ball had\r\nstarted to unwind, ship after ship dropping out of it and going\r\ninto orbit, some badly damaged and some going to attack damaged\r\nenemies. Some of them were completely around the planet, hidden\r\nby it. He saw three ships approaching _Corisande_, _Sun Goddess_,\r\nand the Gilgamesher. He got Harkaman on the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the _Black Star_?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Gone to Em-See-Square,\" Harkaman replied. \"We got the two\r\nDunnan-Makanns. _Bolide_ and _Reliable_.\"\r\n\r\nThen young Steven of Ravary, who had been monitoring one of the\r\nintership screens, had a call from Captain Gompertz of the\r\n_Grendelsbane_, and at the same moment somebody else was yelling,\r\n\"Here comes the _Starhopper_ again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to wait a moment; we have troubles,\" he said.\r\n\r\n_Nemesis_ and _Starhopper_ sledge-hammered each other and parried\r\nwith counter-missiles, and then, quite unexpectedly, the\r\n_Starhopper_ went to Em-See-Square.\r\n\r\nThere was an awful lot of Em being converted to Ee off Marduk,\r\ntoday. Including Manfred Ravallo; that grieved him. Manfred was\r\na good man, and a good friend. He had a girl in Rivington....\r\nNifflheim, there were eight hundred good men aboard the _Black\r\nStar_, and most of them had girls who'd wait in vain for them on\r\nTanith. Well, what had Otto Harkaman said, so long ago, on Gram?\r\nSomething about old age not being a usual cause of death among\r\nSpace Vikings, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nThen he remembered that Gompertz of the _Grendelsbane_ was trying\r\nto get him. He told young Count Steven to switch him over.\r\n\r\n\"We just lost one of our Mardukans,\" Gompertz told him, in his\r\nstaccato Beowulf accent. \"I think she was the _Challenger_. The ship\r\nthat got her looks like the _Banshee_; I'm turning to engage her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way; west around the planet? Be right with you, captain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was like finishing a word puzzle. You sit staring at it, looking\r\nfor more spaces to print letters into, and suddenly you realize\r\nthat there are no more, that the puzzle is done. That was how the\r\nspace-battle of Marduk, the Battle _off_ Marduk, ended. Suddenly\r\nthere were no more colored fire-globes opening and fading, no more\r\nmissiles coming, no more enemy ships to throw missiles at. Now it\r\nwas time to take a count of his own ships, and then begin thinking\r\nabout the Battle _on_ Marduk.\r\n\r\nThe _Black Star_ was gone. So was RMNS _Challenger_, and RMNS\r\n_Conquistador_. _Space Scourge_ was badly hammered; worse than after\r\nthe Beowulf raid, Boake Valkanhayn said. The _Viking's Gift_ was\r\nheavily damaged, too, and so was the _Corisande_, and so, from the\r\nlooks of the damage board, was the _Nemesis_. And three ships were\r\nmissing--the three independent Space Vikings, _Harpy_, _Curse of\r\nCagn_, and Roger-fan-Morvill Esthersan's _Damnthing_.\r\n\r\nPrince Bentrik frowned over that. \"I can't think that all three\r\nof those ships would have been destroyed, without anybody seeing\r\nit happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither can I. But I can think that all those ships broke out of\r\nthe battle together and headed in for the planet. They didn't come\r\nhere to help liberate Marduk, they came here to fill their cargo\r\nholds. I only hope the people they're robbing all voted the Makann\r\nticket in the last election.\" A crumb of comfort occurred to him,\r\nand he passed it on. \"The only people who are armed to resist them\r\nwill be Makann's storm-troops and Dunnan's pirates; they'll be the\r\nones to get killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want any more killing than....\" Prince Simon broke off\r\nsuddenly. \"I'm beginning to talk like his late Highness Crown Prince\r\nEdvard,\" he said. \"He didn't want bloodshed, either, and look whose\r\nblood was shed. If they're doing what you think they are, I'm afraid\r\nwe'll have to kill a few of your Space Vikings, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"They aren't my Space Vikings.\" He was a little surprised to find\r\nthat, after almost eight years of bearing the name himself, he was\r\nusing it as an other-people label. Well, why not? He was the ruler\r\nof the civilized planet of Tanith, wasn't he? \"But let's not start\r\nfighting them till the main war's over. Those three shiploads are\r\nno worse than a bad cold; Makann and Dunnan are the plague.\"\r\n\r\nIt would still take four hours to get down, in a spiral of\r\ndeceleration. They started the telecasts which had been filmed and\r\ntaped on the voyage from Gimli. The Prince-Protector Simon Bentrik\r\nspoke: The illegal rule of the traitor Makann was ended. His deluded\r\nfollowers were advised to return to their allegiance to the Crown.\r\nThe People's Watchmen were ordered to surrender their arms and\r\ndisband; in localities where they refused, the loyal people were\r\ncalled upon to co-operate with the legitimate armed forces of\r\nthe Crown in exterminating them, and would be furnished arms\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\nLittle Princess Myrna spoke: \"If my grandfather is still alive,\r\nhe is your King; if he is not, I am your Queen, and until I am old\r\nenough to rule in my own right, I accept Prince Simon as Regent\r\nand Protector of the Realm, and I call on all of you to obey him\r\nas I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't say anything about representative government, or\r\ndemocracy, or the constitution,\" Trask mentioned. \"And I noticed\r\nthe use of the word 'rule,' instead of 'reign.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" the self-proclaimed Prince-Protector said. \"There's\r\nsomething wrong with democracy. If there weren't, it couldn't be\r\noverthrown by people like Makann, attacking it from within by\r\ndemocratic procedures. I don't think it's fundamentally unworkable.\r\nI think it just has a few of what engineers call bugs. It's not\r\nsafe to run a defective machine till you learn the defects and\r\nremedy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope you don't think our Sword-World feudalism doesn't have\r\nbugs.\" He gave examples, and then quoted Otto Harkaman about barbarism\r\nspreading downward from the top instead of upward from the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"It may just be,\" he added, \"that there is something fundamentally\r\nunworkable about government itself. As long as _Homo sapiens terra_\r\nis a wild animal, which he has always been and always will be until\r\nhe evolves into something different in a million or so years, maybe\r\na workable system of government is a political science impossibility,\r\njust as transmutation of elements was a physical-science impossibility\r\nas long as they tried to do it by chemical means.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll just have to make it work the best way we can, and when\r\nit breaks down, hope the next try will work a little better, for a\r\nlittle longer,\" Bentrik said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMalverton grew in the telescopic screens as they came down. The Navy\r\nSpaceport, where Trask had landed almost two years before, was in\r\nwreckage, sprinkled with damaged ships that had been blasted on the\r\nground, and slagged by thermonuclear fires. There was fighting in\r\nthe air all over the city proper, on building-tops, on the ground,\r\nand in the air. That would be the _Damnthing_-_Harpy_-_Curse of\r\nCagn_ Space Vikings. The Royal Palace was the center of one of\r\nhalf a dozen swirls of battle that had condensed out of the\r\ngeneral skirmishing.\r\n\r\nPaytrik Morland started for it with the first wave of\r\nground-fighters from the _Nemesis_. The Gilgamesh freighter, like\r\nmost of her ilk, had huge cargo ports all around; these began\r\nopening and disgorging a swarm of everything from landing-craft\r\nand hundred-foot airboats to one man air-cavalry single-mounts.\r\nThe top landing-stages and terraces of the palace were almost\r\nobscured by the flashes of auto-cannon shells and the smoke and\r\ndust of projectiles. Then the first vehicles landed, the firing\r\nfrom the air stopped, and men fanned out as skirmishers,\r\noccasionally firing with small arms.\r\n\r\nTrask and Bentrik were in the armory off the vehicle-bay, putting on\r\ncombat equipment, when the twelve-year-old Count of Ravary joined\r\nthem and began rummaging for weapons and a helmet.\r\n\r\n\"You're not going,\" his father told him. \"I'll have enough to worry\r\nabout taking care of myself....\"\r\n\r\nThat was the wrong approach. Trask interrupted:\r\n\r\n\"You're to stay aboard, Count,\" he said. \"As soon as things\r\nstabilize, Princess Myrna will have to come down. You'll act as\r\nher personal escort. And don't think you're being shoved into the\r\nbackground. She's Crown Princess, and if she isn't Queen now, she\r\nwill be in a few years. Escorting her now will be the foundation of\r\nyour naval career. There isn't a young officer in the Royal Navy who\r\nwouldn't trade places with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the right way to handle him, Lucas,\" Bentrik approved,\r\nafter the boy had gone away, proud of his opportunity and his\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\"It'll do just what I said for him.\" He stopped for a moment, to\r\nplay with an idea that had just struck him. \"You know, the girl will\r\nbe Queen in a few years, if she isn't now. Queens need Prince\r\nConsorts. Your son's a good boy; I liked him the first moment I saw\r\nhim, and I've liked him better ever since. He'd be a good man on\r\nthe throne beside Queen Myrna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's out of the question. Not the matter of consanguinity,\r\nthey're about a sixteenth cousin. But people would say I was abusing\r\nthe Protectorship to marry my son onto the Throne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Simon, speaking as one sovereign prince to another, you have a lot\r\nto learn. You've learned one important lesson already, that a ruler\r\nmust be willing to use force and shed blood to enforce his rule. You\r\nhave to learn, too, that a ruler cannot afford to be guided by his\r\nfears of what people will say about him. Not even what history will\r\nsay about him. A ruler's only judge is himself.\"\r\n\r\nBentrik slid the transpex visor of his helmet up and down\r\nexperimentally, checked the chambers of his pistol and carbine.\r\n\r\n\"All that matters to me is the peace and well-being of Marduk. I'll\r\nhave to talk it over with ... with my only judge. Well, let's go.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe top terraces were secure when their car landed. More vehicles\r\nwere coming down and discharging men; a swarm of landing craft were\r\nsinking past the building toward the ground two thousand feet below.\r\nAuto-weapons and small arms and light cannon banged, and bombs and\r\nrecoilless-rifle shells crashed, on the lower terraces. They put the\r\ncar down one of the shaftways until they ran into heavy fire from\r\nbelow, at the limit of the advance, and then turned into a broad\r\nhallway, floating high enough to clear the heads of the men on foot.\r\nIt looked like the part of the Palace where he had lodged when he\r\nhad been a guest there but it probably wasn't.\r\n\r\nThey came to hastily constructed barricades of furniture and\r\nstatuary and furnishings, behind which Makann's People's Watchmen\r\nand Andray Dunnan's Space Vikings were making resistance. They\r\nentered rooms dusty with powdered plaster and acrid with powder\r\nfumes, littered with corpses. They passed lifter-skids being towed\r\nout with wounded. They went through rooms crowded with their own\r\nmen--\"_Keep your fingers off things; this isn't a looting\r\nexpedition!_\" \"_You stupid cretin, how did you know there wasn't a\r\nman hiding behind that?_\" In one huge room, ballroom or concert room\r\nor something, there were prisoners herded, and men from the\r\n_Nemesis_ were setting up polyencephalographic veridicators, sturdy\r\nchairs with wires and adjustable helmets and translucent globes\r\nmounted over them. A couple of Morland's men were hustling a\r\nPeople's Watchman to one and strapping him into a chair.\r\n\r\n\"You know what this is, don't you?\" one of them was saying. \"This is\r\na veridicator. That globe'll light blue; the moment you try to lie\r\nto us, it'll turn red. And the moment it turns red, I'm going to\r\nhammer your teeth down your throat with the butt of this pistol.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you found anything out about the King, yet?\" Bentrik asked him.\r\n\r\nHe turned. \"No. Nobody we've questioned so far knows anything later\r\nthan a month ago about him. He just disappeared.\" He was going to\r\nsay something else, saw Bentrik's face, and changed his mind.\r\n\r\n\"He's dead,\" Bentrik said dully. \"They tortured him and brainwashed\r\nhim and used him as a ventriloquist's dummy on the screen as long as\r\nthey could; when they couldn't let the people see him any more,\r\nthey stuffed him into a converter.\"\r\n\r\nThey did find Zaspar Makann, hours later. Maybe he could have told\r\nthem something, if he had been alive, but he and a few of his\r\nfanatical followers had barricaded themselves in the Throne room and\r\ndied trying to defend it. They found Makann on the Throne, the top\r\nof his head blown away, a pistol death-gripped in his hand, and the\r\nGreat Crown lying on the floor, the velvet inner cap bullet-pierced\r\nand splattered with blood and brain tissue. Prince Bentrik picked it\r\nup and looked at it disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to have something done about that,\" he said. \"I really\r\ndidn't think he'd do just this. I thought he wanted to abolish the\r\nThrone, not sit on it.\"\r\n\r\nExcept for one chandelier smashed and several corpses that had to be\r\ndragged out, the Ministerial Council room was intact. They set up\r\nheadquarters there. Boake Valkanhayn and several other ship-captains\r\njoined them. There was fighting going on in several places inside\r\nthe Palace, and the city was still in a turmoil. Somebody managed\r\nto get in touch with the captains of the _Damnthing_, the _Harpy_\r\nand the _Curse of Cagn_ and bring them to the Palace. Trask attempted\r\nto reason with them, to no avail.\r\n\r\n\"Prince Trask, you're my friend, and you've always dealt fairly with\r\nme,\" Roger-fan-Morvill Esthersan said. \"But you know just how far\r\nany Space Viking captain can control his crew. These men didn't come\r\nhere to correct the political mistakes of Marduk. They came here for\r\nwhat they could haul away. I could get myself killed trying to stop\r\nthem now....\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't even try,\" the captain of the _Curse of Cagn_ put in.\r\n\"I came here for what I could make out of this planet, myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can try to stop them,\" said the captain of the _Harpy_.\r\n\"You'll find it even harder than what you're doing now.\"\r\n\r\nTrask looked at some of the reports that had come in from elsewhere\r\non the planet. Harkaman had landed on one of the big cities to the\r\neast, and the people had risen against Makann's local bosses and\r\nwere helping wipe out the People's Watchmen with arms they had been\r\nfurnished. Valkanhayn's exec had landed on a large concentration\r\ncamp where close to ten thousand of Makann's political enemies had\r\nbeen penned; he had distributed all his available weapons and was\r\ncalling for more. Gompertz of the _Grendelsbane_ was at Drepplin;\r\nhe reported just the reverse. The people there had risen in support\r\nof the Makann regime, and he wanted authorization to use nuclear\r\nweapons against them.\r\n\r\n\"Could you talk your people into going to some other city?\" Trask\r\nasked. \"We have a city for you; big industrial center. It ought to\r\nbe fine looting. Drepplin.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people there are Mardukan subjects, too,\" Bentrik began. Then\r\nhe shrugged. \"It's not what we'd like to do, it's what we have to.\r\nBy all means, gentlemen. Take your men to Drepplin, and nobody will\r\nobject to anything you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you have that place looted out, try Abaddon. You were\r\naground there, Captain Esthersan. You know what all Dunnan left there.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA couple of Space Vikings--no, Royal Army of Tanith men--brought in\r\nthe old woman, dirty, in rags, almost exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"She wants to talk to Prince Bentrik; won't talk to anybody else.\r\nSays she knows where the King is.\"\r\n\r\nBentrik rose quickly, brought her to a chair, poured a glass of wine\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\"He's still alive, Your Highness. The Crown Princess Melanie and I\r\n... I'm sorry, Your Highness; Dowager Crown Princess ... have been\r\ntaking care of him, the best way we could. If you'll only come\r\nquickly....\"\r\n\r\nMikhyl VIII, Planetary King of Marduk, lay on a pallet of filthy\r\nbedding on the floor of a narrow room behind a mass-energy converter\r\nwhich disposed of the rubbish and sewage and generated power for\r\nsome of the fixed equipment on one of the middle floors of the east\r\nwing of the palace. There was a bucket of water, and on a rough\r\nwooden bench lay a cloth-wrapped bundle of food. A woman, haggard\r\nand disheveled, wearing a suit of greasy mechanic's coveralls and\r\nnothing else, squatted beside him. The Crown Princess Melanie, whom\r\nTrask remembered as the charming and gracious hostess of Cragdale.\r\nShe tried to rise, and staggered.\r\n\r\n\"Prince Bentrik! And it's Prince Trask of Tanith!\" she cried.\r\n\"Just hurry; get him out of here and to where he can be taken\r\ncare of. Please.\" Then she sat down again on the floor and fell\r\nover, unconscious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey couldn't get the story. The Princess Melanie had collapsed\r\ncompletely. Her companion, another noblewoman of the court, could\r\nonly ramble disconnectedly. And the King merely lay, bathed and\r\nfed in a clean bed, and looked up at them wonderingly, as though\r\nnothing he saw or heard conveyed any meaning to him. The doctors\r\ncould do nothing.\r\n\r\n\"He has no mind, no more mind than a new-born baby. We can keep him\r\nalive, I don't know how long. That's our professional duty. But it's\r\nno kindness to His Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little pockets of resistance in the Palace were wiped out,\r\nthrough the next morning and afternoon. All but one, far\r\nunderground, below the main power plant. They tried sleep-gas; the\r\ndefenders had blowers and sent it back at them. They tried blasting;\r\nthere was a limit to what the fabric of the building would stand.\r\nAnd nobody knew how long it would take to starve them out.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, a man crawled out, pushing a white shirt tied to\r\nthe barrel of a carbine ahead of him.\r\n\r\n\"Is Prince Lucas Trask of Tanith here?\" he asked. \"I won't speak to\r\nanybody else.\"\r\n\r\nThey brought Trask quickly. All that was visible of the other man\r\nwas the carbine-barrel and the white shirt. When Trask called to\r\nhim, he raised his head above the rubble behind which he was hiding.\r\n\r\n\"Prince Trask, we have Andray Dunnan here; he was leading us, but\r\nnow we've disarmed him and are holding him. If we turn him over to\r\nyou, will you let us go?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you all come out unarmed, and bring Dunnan with you, I promise\r\nyou, the rest of you will be let outside this building and allowed\r\nto go away unharmed.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. We'll be coming out in a minute.\" The man raised his\r\nvoice. \"It's agreed!\" he called. \"Bring him out.\"\r\n\r\nThere were fewer than two score of them. Some wore the uniforms of\r\nhigh officers of the People's Watchmen or of People's Welfare Party\r\nfunctionaries; a few wore the heavily braided short jackets of Space\r\nViking officers. Among them, they propelled a thin-faced man with a\r\npointed beard, and Trask had to look twice at him before he\r\nrecognized the face of Andray Dunnan. It looked more like the face\r\nof Duke Angus of Wardshaven as he last remembered it. Dunnan looked\r\nat him in incurious contempt.\r\n\r\n\"Your dotard king couldn't rule without Zaspar Makann, and Makann\r\ncouldn't rule without me, and neither can you,\" he said. \"Shoot this\r\ngang of turncoats, and I'll rule Marduk for you.\" He looked at Trask\r\nagain. \"Who are you?\" he demanded. \"I don't know you.\"\r\n\r\nTrask slipped the pistol from his holster, thumbing off the safety.\r\n\r\n\"I am Lucas Trask. You've heard that name before,\" he said. \"Stand\r\naway from behind him, you people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; the poor fool who thought he was going to marry Elaine\r\nKarvall. Well, you won't, Lord Trask of Traskon. She loves me, not\r\nyou. She's waiting for me now, on Gram....\"\r\n\r\nTrask shot him through the head. Dunnan's eyes widened in momentary\r\nincredulity; then his knees gave way, and he fell forward on his\r\nface. Trask thumbed on the safety and holstered the pistol, and\r\nlooked at the body on the concrete.\r\n\r\nIt hadn't made the least difference. It had been like shooting a\r\nsnake, or one of the nasty scorpion-things that infested the old\r\nbuildings in Rivington. Just no more Andray Dunnan.\r\n\r\n\"Take that carrion and stuff it in a mass-energy converter,\" he\r\nsaid. \"And I don't want anybody to mention the name of Andray Dunnan\r\nto me again.\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't look at them haul Dunnan's body away on a lifter-skid;\r\nhe watched the fifty-odd leaders of the overthrown misgovernment\r\nof Marduk shamble away to freedom, guarded by Paytrik Morland's\r\nriflemen. Now there was something to reproach himself for; he'd\r\ncommitted a separate and distinct crime against Marduk by letting\r\neach one of them live. Unless recognized and killed by somebody\r\noutside, every one of them would be at some villainy before next\r\nsunrise. Well, King Simon I could cope with that.\r\n\r\nHe started when he realized how he had thought of his friend. Well,\r\nwhy not? Mikhyl's mind was dead; his body would not survive it more\r\nthan a year. Then a child Queen, and a long regency, and long\r\nregencies were dangerous. Better a strong King, in name as well as\r\npower. And the succession could be safeguarded by marrying Steven\r\nand Myrna. Myrna had accepted, at eight, that she must some day\r\nmarry for reasons of state; why not her playmate Steven?\r\n\r\nAnd Simon Bentrik would see the necessity. He was neither a fool nor\r\na moral coward; he only needed to take some time to adjust to ideas.\r\nThe rabble who had bought their lives with their leader's had gone,\r\nnow. Slowly, he followed them, thinking.\r\n\r\nDon't press the idea on Simon too hard; just expose him to it and\r\nlet him adopt it. And there would be the treaty--Tanith, Marduk,\r\nBeowulf, Amaterasu; eventually, treaties with the other civilized\r\nplanets. Nebulously, the idea of a League of Civilized Worlds began\r\nto take shape in his mind.\r\n\r\nBe a good idea if he adopted the title of King of Tanith for\r\nhimself. And cut loose from the Sword-Worlds; especially cut loose\r\nfrom Gram. Let Viktor of Xochitl have it. Or Garvan Spasso. Viktor\r\nwouldn't be the last Space Viking to take his ships back against\r\nthe Sword-Worlds. Sooner or later, civilization in the Old Federation\r\nwould drive them all home to loot the planets that had sent them out.\r\n\r\nWell, if he was going to be a king, shouldn't he have a queen? Kings\r\nusually did. He climbed into the little hall-car and started up a\r\nlong shaft. There was Valerie Alvarath. They'd enjoyed each other's\r\nsociety on the _Nemesis_. He wondered if she would want to make it\r\npermanent, even on a throne....\r\n\r\nElaine was with him. He felt her beside him, almost tangibly. Her\r\nvoice was whispering to him: _She loves you, Lucas. She'll say yes.\r\nBe good to her, and she'll make you happy._ Then she was gone, and\r\nhe knew that she would never return.\r\n\r\nGood-by, Elaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIN]\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInconsistent hyphenation; the former forms were all changed to the latter:\r\n  Space-Scourge (7) vs. Space Scourge (41)\r\n  Sun-Goddess (3) vs. Sun Goddess (3)\r\n\r\n  Jaganath (2) vs. Jagannath (4)\r\n  Amaterasun (1) vs. Amaterasuan[s] (1)\r\n  handphone (1) vs. hand-phone (3)\r\n  planetside (1) vs. planet-side (1)\r\n  slagpile (1) vs. slag-pile (1)\r\n  trade planets (3) vs. trade-planets (10)\r\n  two hand (1) vs. two-hand (1)\r\n  air cavalry (1) vs. air-cavalry (2)\r\n  smallarms (1) vs. small arms (5)\r\n\r\nThinkos:\r\n  Admiral of the Royal Mardukan Navy.\" [Chap.
